    "text": "smell of distant city smokestacks clung to the insides of his nostrils.\nOnlookers, he considered, might comment to one another that he looked\nlike a hound testing the air – though only a fool would compare a Privileged\nsorcerer to a lowly dog anywhere within earshot – and they wouldn’t be\nentirely wrong.\nPrivileged sorcery was tuned to the elements and the Else, giving\nRobson and any of his brother or sister Privileged a deep and unrivaled\nunderstanding of the world. Such an understanding, a sixth sense, provided\nhim an invaluable advantage in any number of situations. But in this\nparticular case, it gave Robson nothing more than a vague hint of unease, a\ncloudy premonition that caused a tingling sensation in his fingertips.\nHe remained poised on the carriage step for almost a full minute before\nfinally lowering himself to the ground.\nThe countryside was empty, floodplains and farmland rolling toward the\nhorizon to the south and west. A salty wind blew off the ocean to the east,\nand to the north the Fatrastan capital of Landfall sat perched atop a mighty,\ntwo-hundred-foot limestone plateau. The city was less than two miles away,\npractically within spitting distance, and the presence of the Lady\nChancellor’s secret police meant that it was very unlikely that any threat\nwas approaching from that direction.\nRobson remained beside his carriage, pulling on his gloves and flexing\nhis fingers as he tested his access to the Else. He could feel the usual\ncrackle and spark of sorcery just out of reach, waiting to be tamed, and\nallowed a small smile at the comfort it brought him. Perhaps he was being\nfoolish. The only thing capable of challenging a Privileged was a powder\nmage, and there were none of those in Landfall. What else could possibly\ncause such disquiet?\nHe scanned the horizon a second and third time, reaching out with his\nsenses. There was nothing out there but a few farmers and the usual\nhighway traffic passing along on the other side of his carriage. He tugged at\nthe Else with a twitch of his middle finger, pulling on the invisible thread\nuntil he’d brought enough power into this world to create a shield of\nhardened air around his body.\nOne could never be too careful.\n“I’ll just be a moment, Thom,” he said to his driver, who was already\nnodding off in the box.\nRobson’s boots squelched as he followed a muddy track away from the\nhighway and toward a cluster of dirty tents. A work camp had been set up a\nfew hundred yards away from the road in the center of a trampled cotton\nfield, occupying the top of a small rise, and a small army of laborers hauled\nsoil from a pit at the center of the camp.\nRobson’s unease continued to grow as he approached the camp, but he\npushed it aside, forcing a cold smile on his face as an older man left the ring\nof tents and came out to greet him.\n“Privileged Robson,” the man said, bowing several times before\noffering his hand. “My name is Cressel. Professor Cressel. I’m the head of\nthe excavation. Thank you so much for coming on such short notice.”\nRobson shook Cressel’s hand, noting the way the professor flinched"

    "text": "the excavation. Thank you so much for coming on such short notice.”\nRobson shook Cressel’s hand, noting the way the professor flinched\nwhen he touched the embroidered fabric of Robson’s gloves. Cressel was a\nthin man, stooped from years of bending over books, square spectacles\nperched on the tip of his nose and only a wisp of gray hair remaining on his\nhead. Over sixty years old, he was almost twenty years Robson’s senior and\na respected faculty member at Landfall University. Robson practically\ntowered over him.\nCressel snatched his hand back as soon as he was able, clenching and\nunclenching his fingers as he looked pensively toward the highway. He was,\nfrom all appearances, an awfully flighty man.\n“I was told it was important,” Robson said.\nCressel stared at him for several moments. “Oh. Yes! Yes, it’s very\nimportant. At least, I think so.”\n“You think so? I’m having supper with the Lady Chancellor herself in\ntwo hours and you think this is important?”\nA bead of sweat appeared on Cressel’s forehead. “I’m so sorry,\nPrivileged. I didn’t know, I…”\n“I’m already here,” Robson said, cutting off the old professor. “Just get\nto the point.”\nAs they drew closer to the camp Robson noted a dozen or so guards,\ncarrying muskets and truncheons, forming a loose cordon around the\nperimeter. There were more guards inside, distinguished by the yellow\njackets they wore, overlooking the laborers.\nRobson didn’t entirely approve of work camps. The laborers tended to\nbe unreliable, slow, and weak from malnourishment, but Fatrasta was a\nfrontier city and received more than its fair share of criminals and convicts\nshipped over from the Nine. Lady Chancellor Lindet had long ago decided\nthe only thing to do with them was let them earn their freedom in the\ncamps. It gave the city enough labor for the dozens of public works\nprojects, and to lend out to private organizations including, in this case,\nLandfall University.\n“Do you know what we’re doing here?” Cressel asked.\n“Digging up another one of those Dynize relics, I heard.” The damned\nthings were all over the place, ancient testaments to a bygone civilization\nthat had retreated from this continent well before anyone from the Nine\nactually arrived. They jutted from the center of parks, provided foundations\nfor buildings, and, if some rumors were to be believed, there was an entire\ncity’s worth of stone construction buried beneath the floodplains that\nsurrounded Landfall. Some of the artifacts still retained traces of ancient\nsorcery, making them of special interest to scholars and Privileged.\n“Right. Quite right. The point,” Cressel said, wringing his hands. “The\npoint, Privileged Robson, is that we’ve had six workers go mad since we\nreached the forty-foot mark of the artifact.”\nRobson tore his mind away from the logistics of the labor camp and\nglanced at Cressel. “Mad, you say?”\n“Stark, raving mad,” Cressel confirmed.\n“Show me the artifact.”\nCressel led him toward the center of the camp, where they came upon"

    "text": "“Stark, raving mad,” Cressel confirmed.\n“Show me the artifact.”\nCressel led him toward the center of the camp, where they came upon\nan immense pit in the ground. It was about twenty yards across and nearly\nas deep, and at its center was an eight-foot-squared obelisk surrounded by\nscaffolding. Beneath a flaking coat of mud, the obelisk was made of\nsmooth, light gray limestone carved, no doubt, from the quarry at the center\nof the Landfall Plateau. Robson recognized the large letters on its side as\nOld Dynize, not an uncommon sight on the ruins that dotted the city.\nRobson felt his stomach turn. The sorcery crackling at the edges of his\nsenses seemed to shy away, as if repulsed by the very presence of the\nobelisk. “It looks entirely ordinary,” he said, removing a handkerchief and\nblowing his nose to hide the tremble in his fingers. “Just another old rock\nthe Dynize left behind.”\n“That’s what we think, too,” Cressel agreed, adjusting his mud-\nsplattered spectacles. “There is very little unique about this artifact, except\nfor the fact that it is so far from the ancient city center.”\n“If there’s nothing special about it, why are you bothering to dig it up?”\nRobson asked petulantly.\n“It sank into the soft soil of the floodplains. Aside from the water, we\nthought it would be a very easy dig.”\n“And is it?”\n“So far,” Cressel said. He hesitated, and then said, “Until the madness\nset in, that is.”\n“What happened?”\n“The workers.” Cressel gestured toward the stream of laborers hauling\nbaskets of rubble up the wooden ramps at the edges of the excavation site.\n“We estimate the artifact is about eighty feet tall – probably the longest of\nits kind in the city. Last week, about sixty feet down, or rather twenty feet\nfrom the bottom, we found some unusual writing. That very day, one of the\nlaborers went mad.”\n“Correlation is not causation,” Robson said, not bothering to hide the\nimpatience in his voice.\n“True, true. We assumed it was just heatstroke at first. But it happened\nagain the next day. Then the next. And every day since. By the sixth we\ndecided to call on you because, well, you’ve been very keen on the\nuniversity and we thought…”\n“I could do you a favor,” Robson finished sourly. He made a mental\nnote to make his annual donations to the university a few thousand krana\nsmaller. Best not to let them think him overly generous. He liked the\nuniversity, was fascinated by their search for knowledge both past and\nfuture, but they’d overstepped their bounds this time. He was a busy man.\n“What do you mean by ‘unusual writing’?” he asked.\n“It’s not written in Old Dynize. In fact, no one at the university\nrecognized the language. Here, you should come down and see it.” Cressel\nimmediately began descending one of the ramps leading into the excavation\npit. “I would appreciate a Privileged’s perspective on this.”\nRobson’s skin crawled, and he remained rooted to the ground, dread\nsinking to the pit of his stomach like a ball of lead. He couldn’t quite place"

    "text": "Robson’s skin crawled, and he remained rooted to the ground, dread\nsinking to the pit of his stomach like a ball of lead. He couldn’t quite place\nthe source of his misgivings. Ancient ruins on this continent were always\nmarked with Old Dynize. Finding a different language written on one of\nthese obelisks might have historical significance, but surely a matter of\ntranslation shouldn’t leave him with such trepidation.\nHe wondered if his senses were trying to warn him off from something.\nIt would be easy enough to tell Cressel no. He could order the dig closed,\nthe obelisk destroyed by gunpowder or sorcery.\nBut Privileged didn’t maintain their reputations by being timid, so he\nfollowed Cressel down into the depths of the dig.\nLaborers scurried out of their way as Cressel led Robson across the\nrickety scaffolding until they were standing beside the obelisk, staring at a\nspot only a few feet from the bottom of the pit. One of the stone’s smooth\nfaces bore an intricate inscription. It had been meticulously cleaned of soil,\nrevealing an almost-white face covered in flowing letters entirely unfamiliar\nto Robson’s eyes.\nHe peered at the letters for several moments. “Have there been any\npatterns in the madness?” he asked absently. Behind them, the soft\nthumping sound of laborers hacking at the soil with mattocks and shovels\nreverberated through the pit.\n“It appears to affect only those who spend the better part of the day\ndown here,” Cressel said. “When the third case happened, I suspended\nfaculty or camp guards from descending into the pit unless it was an\nemergency.”\nBut not the laborers, Robson noted. Oh well. Someone had to suffer in\nthe pursuit of knowledge.\nRobson tilted his head to one side, beginning to see repeated patterns in\nthe flowing letters. As Cressel mentioned, this was indeed a script of some\nkind. But what language? A Privileged of Robson’s age was as learned in a\nbroad selection of studies as most professors were in their own fields but\nRobson had never seen anything like this.\nThe writing was ancient. Older than the Dynize script surrounding it,\nwhich was one of the oldest languages known to modern linguistics.\nSlowly, hesitantly, Robson lifted his hand. He reached out for the Else,\ngrasping for the wild sorcery from beyond this world. The sorcery once\nagain shied away, and he had to wrestle to keep it close at hand in case he\nneeded it in a pinch. There was something sinister about this obelisk, and he\nwould not be caught unawares.\nWhen he was certain he’d prepared himself against any sort of backlash,\nhe touched his gloved fingertips to the plaque.\nA vision stabbed through Robson’s mind. He saw a man, a familiar face\nwreathed in golden curls, hands held out as if to cradle the world.\nWhiteness surrounded the figure, brilliant and unforgiving, and Robson was\nnot entirely sure whether the man was creating the whiteness or being\nconsumed by it.\nRobson jerked his fingertips back and the vision was gone. He found\nhimself shaking violently, his clothes soaked with sweat, as Cressel looked\non in shock."

He found\nhimself shaking violently, his clothes soaked with sweat, as Cressel looked\non in shock.\nRobson rubbed his hands together, noting that the fingertips of his right\nglove were gone, seared away, though his fingers were unhurt. He left\nCressel standing on the platform, dumbfounded, as he ran up the ramps and\nthrough the camp, sprinting all the way back to his carriage.\n“Thom!”\nThe snoozing driver jolted awake. “My lord?”\n“Thom, I need you to take a message to the Lady Chancellor. Give it to\nher in person, without anyone else present.”\n“Yes, my lord! What is the message?”\n“Tell her that I’ve found it.”\nThom scratched his head. “Is that it?”\n“Yes!” Robson said. “That’s all you need to know for your own safety.\nNow go!”\nHe watched the carriage cut across the highway, nearly running a train\nof pack mules off the road and leaving a cursing merchant in its wake.\nRobson pulled out his handkerchief and dabbed his forehead, only to find\nthat his handkerchief was also soaked with sweat.\n“Privileged!”\nRobson turned to find that the old professor had caught up.\n“Privileged,” Cressel wheezed. “What’s happening? Are you all right?”\n“Yes, yes, I’m fine.” Robson waved him off and began striding back\ntoward the camp. Cressel fell in beside him.\n“But, sir, you look like you’ve seen a ghost!”\nRobson considered the brief vision, his brow furrowing as he let it hang\nin his mind for a few moments. “No,” he said. “Not a ghost. I’ve seen\nGod.”\nCHAPTER 1\nF\nort Samnan was in ruins.\nThe largest fortification on the western branch of the Tristan River,\nSamnan’s twenty-foot palisade of split cypress trunks enclosed a sizable\ntrading town and wooden motte that held a community center and several\nadministration buildings. Forty-foot guard towers overlooked the river on\none side and a few hundred acres of cleared, drained farmland on the other.\nThe fort stood as a monument to civilization in the center of the biggest\npiece of swampland in the world, which made Vlora all the more saddened\nto see it in its current state.\nThe mighty doors lay broken just inside walls that had been breached in\na dozen places by artillery. Most of the towers were nothing but smoldering\nremains, and the shelled motte had been reduced to splinters. Smoke rose\nover the fort, billowing a thousand feet high into the hot, humid afternoon\nsky.\nThe aftermath of a battle rarely elicited horror within her. No career\nsoldier could view battle after battle with horror and keep her sanity for\nvery long but for Vlora there was always a sort of melancholy there,\nmasking the shock. It tugged at the back of her mind and stifled the urge to\ncelebrate a fight well won.\nVlora tasted the familiar tang of smoke on her tongue and spit into the\nmud, watching soldiers in their crimson and blue jackets as they drifted in\nand out of the haze.

    "text": "Vlora tasted the familiar tang of smoke on her tongue and spit into the\nmud, watching soldiers in their crimson and blue jackets as they drifted in\nand out of the haze. The men cleared away the dead, inventoried the\nweapons, set up surgeries, and counted the prisoners. It was done quickly,\nefficiently, without looting, rape, or murder, and for that Vlora felt a flash of\npride. But her eyes lingered on the bodies, wondering what the final tally\nwould be on both sides of the conflict.\nVlora worked her way through what remained of the gatehouse,\nstepping over the shattered timber that had once been the fort doors,\npausing to let two soldiers pass with a stretcher held between them. She\nsucked nervously on her teeth as she got her first view of the trading town\ninside the fort. Some of the buildings had escaped the shelling, but the rest\nhad fared little better than the motte.\nFrontier forts were built to have modern weapons and light artillery on\nthe inside, with Palo arrows and outdated muskets on the outside. Not the\nother way around.\nOut of the corner of her eye she caught sight of a soldier creeping out\nfrom a half-ruined building, a small box under one arm. She tilted her head,\nfeeling more bemused than angry, and struggled to remember his name.\n“Private Dobri!” she finally called out.\nThe soldier, a little man with an oversize nose and long fingers, leapt a\nfoot into the air. He whirled toward Vlora, attempting to hide the box\nbehind his back.\n“Ma’am!” he said, snapping a salute and managing to drop the box. A\nfew cups and a load of silverware spilled onto the street.\nVlora eyed him for a long moment, letting him stew in his discomfort.\n“You looking for the owner of that fine silver, Dobri?”\nDobri’s eyes widened. He held the salute, eyes forward, and Vlora could\nmake out just the slightest tremble. She approached him sidelong, ignoring\nthe silver, and did a quick circuit around him. He wore the same uniform as\nher, a blood-red jacket and pants with dark blue stripes and cuffs. It had\ngold buttons and a brass pin at the lapel of muskets crossed behind a shako\n– the symbol of the Riflejack Mercenary Company. The uniform was dusty,\nwith soot stains on his trousers and arms. He opened his mouth, closed it,\nthen gave a defeated sigh. “No, Lady Flint. I was stealing it.”\n“Well,” Vlora said. “At least you remembered how little I like a liar.”\nShe considered the situation for a few moments. The battle had been short\nbut fierce, and Dobri had been one of the first of her soldiers through the\nwalls once their artillery had battered down the gates. He was a brave\nsoldier, if light-fingered. “Give the silver to the quartermaster for inventory,\nthen tell Colonel Olem you volunteer for latrine duty for the next three\nweeks. I wouldn’t suggest telling him why, unless you want to end up in\nfront of a firing squad.”\n“Yes, Lady Flint.”\n“The Riflejacks do not steal,” Vlora said. “We’re mercenaries, not\nthieves.

    "text": "“Yes, Lady Flint.”\n“The Riflejacks do not steal,” Vlora said. “We’re mercenaries, not\nthieves. Dismissed.”\nShe watched Dobri gather the silver and then scramble toward the\nquartermaster’s tent outside the fort walls. She wondered if she should have\nmade an example of him – she did have the moniker “Flint” to uphold, after\nall. But the men had been on the frontier for almost a year. Sympathy and\ndiscipline needed to be handed out equally, or she’d wind up with a mutiny\non her hands.\n“General Flint!”\nShe turned, finding a young sergeant approaching from the direction of\nthe demolished motte. “Sergeant Padnir, what can I help you with?”\nThe sergeant saluted. “Colonel Olem’s asking for your presence,\nma’am. He says it’s urgent.”\nVlora scowled. Padnir was pale, despite the heat, and had a nervous\nlook in his eyes. He was a levelheaded man in his late twenties, just a few\nyears younger than her, one of the many soldiers under her command to be\nforged during the Adran-Kez War. Something must have gone wrong for\nhim to get so worked up. “Of course. Just making my rounds. I’ll come\nimmediately.”\nShe followed the sergeant down the street, turning onto the main\nthoroughfare of the town. She paused once to examine the line of prisoners,\nall kneeling on the side of the road, a handful of soldiers guarding them.\nEvery one of them was a Palo – Fatrastan natives with bright red hair and\npale freckled skin. At a glance she could tell that they were villagers, not\nwarriors.\nThis particular group had seized Fort Samnan, declaring that the fort\nwas on their land and forbidding the Fatrastan government from passing\nthrough the area. They’d killed a few dozen settlers and torched some\nfarmhouses, but not much else. It was fairly mild as far as insurrections\nwent.\nThe Fatrastan government had responded by sending Vlora and the\nRiflejack Mercenary Company to put down the rebels. It wasn’t the first\ntime Vlora had put down an insurrection on the frontier – the Fatrastans\npaid well, after all – and she didn’t think it would be the last.\nA few of the faces glanced up at her, staring vacantly. Some of them\nglared, a few cursed in Palo as she walked past. She ignored them.\nShe didn’t like fighting the Palo, who tended to be passionate,\nunderfunded, and out-armed. That meant a lot of guerrilla warfare, with\nleaders like the elusive Red Hand causing disproportionate damage to any\nFatrastan army with the bad luck to get singled out. Pitched battles – like\nthe siege of Fort Samnan – turned into a damned slaughter in the other\ndirection.\nAs far as Vlora saw it, the poor fools had a point. This was their land.\nThey’d been here since the Dynize left this place almost a thousand years\nago, long before the Kressians came over from the Nine and started\ncolonizing Fatrasta. Unfortunately for them, the Palo couldn’t afford to hire\nthe Riflejacks, while the Fatrastan government could."

Unfortunately for them, the Palo couldn’t afford to hire\nthe Riflejacks, while the Fatrastan government could.\nVlora left the prisoners behind and found Colonel Olem just a few\nmoments later, on the opposite side of the destroyed motte. At forty-five,\nthe colonel was beginning to show his age, streaks of gray creeping into his\nsandy beard. Vlora thought it made him look distinguished. He wore the\nsame red and blue uniform as his comrades with only the single silver star\nat his lapel, opposite the crossed muskets and shako, to mark his rank. An\nunlit cigarette hung out of one corner of his mouth.\n“Colonel,” Vlora said.\n“Flint,” Olem responded without looking up. Technically, he was\nVlora’s second officer. In reality, they were both retired generals of the\nAdran Army and co-owners of the Riflejack Mercenary Company, putting\nthem on equal footing. He preferred the formality of just being “Colonel”\nOlem, but she deferred to his judgment just as often as he did to hers.\nOlem sat back on his haunches, hands on his knees, looking perplexed.\nThe corpse of an old Palo man lay stretched out before him. The body\nwas bent, with freckled skin as wrinkled as a prune, and still bleeding from\nmultiple gunshot and bayonet wounds. At least two dozen bodies in\nRiflejack uniforms lay scattered around the corpse. Throats and stomachs\nhad been slashed. A pair of rifles had been snapped clean in two.\n“What happened here?”\n“Your guess is as good as mine,” Olem said. He stood up and struck a\nmatch on his belt, shielding the flame from the breeze. He lit his cigarette,\npuffing moodily as he eyed the corpse of the old man at their feet.\nVlora gazed at the bodies of her soldiers. She named them silently in\nher head – Forlin, Jad, Wellans. The list went on. They were all privates,\nand she didn’t know any of them well, but they were still her men. “Who’s\nthis son of a bitch?” she asked, gesturing at the Palo corpse.\n“No idea.”\n“Did he do this?”\n“Seems so,” Olem said. “We already dragged off fifteen wounded.”\nVlora chewed on that information for a moment, trying to catch up. It\ndidn’t make any sense. Palo tended to be scrappy fighters, but they dropped\nlike anyone else against trained soldiers with bayonets fixed. “How did” –\nshe did a quick count – “a single old man inflict almost forty casualties on\nthe best damned infantry on the continent?”\n“That,” Olem said, “is a really good question.”\n“And… ?” She gave him a long, annoyed look. It was one that sent\nmost of her men scrambling. Olem, as usual, seemed unaffected.\n“The boys say he moved too fast for the eye to follow. Like…” Olem\npaused, meeting her eyes. “Like a powder mage.”\nVlora reached out with her sorcerous senses, probing into the Else.

    "text": "paused, meeting her eyes. “Like a powder mage.”\nVlora reached out with her sorcerous senses, probing into the Else. As a\npowder mage she could feel every powder charge and horn within hundreds\nof yards, each of them showing up in her mind’s eye like points on a map.\nShe focused on the body. The old man didn’t have an ounce of powder on\nhim, but she could sense a sort of subtle sorcery around him the likes of\nwhich she’d never felt. Further examination gave her a headache, and she\nclosed her third eye.\n“Well,” she told Olem, “he wasn’t a powder mage. There’s something…\nsorcerous about him, but I can’t pin it down.”\n“I didn’t feel it,” he responded. He had his own Knack, a minor sorcery\nthat allowed him to go without sleep. But his ability to see into the Else was\nnot as strong as hers.\nVlora knelt next to the body, giving it a second look without sorcery.\nThe old man’s hair had long since faded from red to white, and his gnarled\nhands still clutched a pair of polished bone axes. Most Palo dressed for their\nsurroundings – buckskins on the frontier, suits or trousers in the city. This\nwarrior, however, wore thick, dark leathers that didn’t come from any\nmammal. The skin was ridged, tough to the touch, textured like a snake.\n“You ever seen anybody wear an outfit like this before?”\n“It’s swamp dragon leather,” Olem observed. “I’ve seen satchels and\nboots, but the stuff is damned expensive. Hard to tan. Nobody wears a\nwhole suit.” He ashed his cigarette. “And I’ve definitely never seen a Palo\nfight like this. Might be cause for concern.”\n“Maybe,” Vlora said, feeling suddenly shaken. Being stuck in the\nswamps with the swamp dragons, snakes, bugs, and Palo was bad enough.\nBut out here, the Riflejacks had always been at the top of the food chain.\nUntil now. She ran her fingers over the leather. The stuff appeared to make\nan effective armor, thick enough to turn a knife or even a bayonet thrust.\n“It’s like a uniform,” she muttered.\n“Rumors are going to spread,” Olem said. “Should I put a stop to idle\ntalk?”\n“No,” Vlora said. “Let the men gossip. But give them an order. If they\nsee somebody wearing an outfit like this, they’re to form ranks and keep\nhim at the end of their bayonets. And send someone running for me.”\nOlem’s brow wrinkled. “You think you could fight someone capable of\ncutting through this many infantry?” he asked.\n“No idea. But I’ll be damned if I let some Palo yokel carve through my\nmen like a holiday ham. I can at least put a bullet in his head from thirty\npaces.”\n“And if there’s more than one?”\nVlora glared at him.\n“Right,” Olem said, finishing his cigarette and crushing the butt\nunderfoot. “Form line, call for General Flint.”\nVlora and Olem stood in silence for several minutes, watching as the\nrest of the corpses were carted off and the fires finally put out by the bucket"

    "text": "underfoot. “Form line, call for General Flint.”\nVlora and Olem stood in silence for several minutes, watching as the\nrest of the corpses were carted off and the fires finally put out by the bucket\nbrigade. Messengers dropped reports off to Olem, and a flagpole was raised\nabove one of the few remaining fort towers. The Fatrastan flag, sunflower\nyellow with green corners, was run up it along with the smaller, red and\nblue standard of the Riflejacks.\nVlora watched as a woman on horseback rode through the shattered fort\ngate and guided her horse through the crowds and the chaos of the battle\ncleanup. The woman examined her surroundings with a jaded, casual air, a\nsneer on her lips for the Palo prisoners on their knees in the street. Vlora\ndidn’t know the woman, but she recognized the yellow uniform well\nenough – it matched the flag her men had just run up the pole. Fatrastan\nmilitary.\nThe rider came to a stop in front of Vlora and Olem, looking down on\nthem with a fixed scowl. No salute. Not even a hello.\n“You General Flint?” the woman asked.\n“Who wants to know?” Vlora responded.\n“Message from Lady Chancellor Lindet,” the woman said. She pulled\nan envelope from her jacket and held it out. Olem took it from her, tearing it\nopen with one finger and smoothing the paper against his stomach. The\nwoman turned her horse around without a word and immediately rode back\ndown the street, heading for the fort gate.\nFatrastan soldiers tended to be arrogant pricks, but Vlora had seldom\nseen one so rude. She tapped the butt of her pistol. “Would it be terribly\nunprofessional of me to shoot her hat off?”\n“Yes,” Olem said without looking up from the letter.\n“Damned Fatrastan army needs to show more respect to the people\ndoing their dirty work.”\n“Console yourself with the fact that you make far more money than she\ndoes,” Olem said. “Here, you’ll want to see this.”\nVlora turned her attention to the letter in his hand. “What is it?”\n“Trouble in Landfall,” he said. “We’ve been recalled. We’re to head to\nthe city immediately.”\nVlora’s first thought was to do a little dance. Landfall might be hot and\nfetid, but at least it was a modern city. She could have a real meal, go to the\ntheater, and even take a bath. No more of this damned swamp or – she\nglanced at the body of the little old man that was only now being removed –\nits dragon-skin-wearing Palo.\nHer relief, however, was quickly squashed by a creeping suspicion.\n“What kind of trouble?” she asked.\n“Doesn’t say.”\n“Of course it doesn’t.” Vlora chewed on her bottom lip. “Finish the\ncleanup,” she said, “and send the prisoners to Planth with a regiment of our\nboys. Tell everyone else we’re leaving at first light.”\nVlora waited by the Tristan River while her men boarded the waiting\nkeelboats that had been sent to retrieve them.

    "text": "Vlora waited by the Tristan River while her men boarded the waiting\nkeelboats that had been sent to retrieve them. Heading downriver by\nkeelboat would get them to Landfall in just a few days, but she wondered\nwhat could be so urgent that they needed to be recalled in such a manner. It\nmade her nervous, but she put that in the back of her mind and turned to the\nbox in her lap.\nIt was an old hat box, something she’d had since she was a teenager,\nand it was filled with letters from a former lover now long dead and gone.\nTaniel Two-shot had been a childhood friend, an adopted brother, even her\nfiancé at one point, but he’d also been a hero of the Fatrastan Revolution.\nEleven years ago he’d fought for Fatrastan independence from the Kez\nthrough these very swamps, creeping through the channels with his musket,\nkilling Privileged sorcerers and officers.\nThey were both Adrans, foreigners to this place, and the experiences\nTaniel wrote to her about had become a wealth of information for her own\ncareer in mercenary work on this blasted continent.\n“They’ve sent us enough keelboats for the infantry only,” a voice\nsuddenly said.\nVlora jumped, reaching to hide the letters, but stopped herself. It was\nonly Olem, and there were no secrets between them. “And what do we do\nwith our dragoons and cuirassiers?”\nOlem crushed the butt of his cigarette under his boot, peering at the\nletters in her lap. “I’ll have Major Gustar bring them along. It’ll take them\nabout a week longer to arrive in Landfall, so let’s hope we don’t need them\nsooner. Are those Taniel’s letters?”\n“Yes,” she said, flipping through them absently. The loss of her cavalry,\neven for a week, was an irritating prospect. “Looking to see if he ever\nmentioned any crazy Palo warriors wearing swamp dragon leathers.”\n“Seems like something that would have stood out,” Olem said. He sat\ndown beside her in the grass, watching as a new keelboat pulled up to load\nmore soldiers. Behind them, Fort Samnan still smoldered.\nVlora felt a pang of nostalgia. The letters were a constant reminder of a\npast life – for both her and Olem. “I would have thought so, but I wanted to\ncheck anyway.”\n“Probably a good idea,” Olem agreed. “The Palo liked him, didn’t\nthey?”\n“He’s still a damned legend, even after all this time,” Vlora said, hoping\nshe didn’t sound too sour. Every mention of Taniel put her on edge. Their\nhistory had been a… turbulent one.\n“Do you think he would have fought for Fatrastan independence if he\nhad known the Fatrastans would go on to treat the Palo like that?” Olem\nasked, jerking his head toward Fort Samnan.\n“Maybe. Maybe not.” Vlora had some qualms about what she did for a\nliving. But mercenary work couldn’t always be choosy. “He got into that\nwar to kill Kez. Came out of it…” Vlora’s eyes narrowed involuntarily as\nshe remembered the redheaded companion Taniel had brought back from"

    "text": "war to kill Kez. Came out of it…” Vlora’s eyes narrowed involuntarily as\nshe remembered the redheaded companion Taniel had brought back from\nhis travels. “Well.” She snapped the hat box shut. “Nothing useful in here,\nnot regarding that Palo warrior anyway.” She got to her feet and offered\nOlem a hand. “Let’s go to Landfall.”\nCHAPTER 2\nM\nichel Bravis sat at the back of an empty pub, nursing a warm beer at six\no’clock in the morning. Outside he could hear the local teamsters\nalready at work hauling cotton and grain down to the docks, cursing the\nheat with every other breath. He wondered if there was a single person who\nactually liked summer in Landfall, but decided such a thing would be an\naffront against every god that ever existed.\nHe had spent most of his life in Landfall. He’d grown into a man during\nthe revolution, worked the docks conning merchants and tourists during the\nreconstruction, and now as he approached thirty he served in the Lady\nChancellor’s secret police – or, as they were more widely known, the\nBlackhats. I would think, he thought to himself bitterly, that I would have\nlearned to head north for the summers.\nHe took a long sip of beer, checking his pocket watch. Eleven minutes\npast. Mornings, summer, and people being late. A perfect trifecta to put him\nin a foul mood.\nAnd once in a foul mood in this blasted heat, he’d stay that way for the\nrest of the day.\nHe forced a grin on his face and displayed it to the empty bar. “You\ndon’t have to be in a bad mood,” he said. “Cheer up. It could be worse. You\ncould be outside.”\n“Good point,” he replied to himself, taking on a serious air. “Besides,\nwe’ve got beer on tap in here, and the owner won’t be around until noon.”\n“You,” he said in his happy voice, draining the rest of his beer and\nheading behind the bar to refill his glass, “are going to get very drunk.”\n“Yes. Yes I am.”\nHe often wondered what people thought when they overheard him\nspeaking to himself. Probably that he was a mad fool. But circumstance had\noften found him alone as a young man, and speaking aloud helped him\ngather his thoughts and stave off boredom on the long, hot Fatrastan nights.\nBesides, in his line of work it was best to keep people at arm’s length.\nHe was on his third beer when the door finally opened and a young man\nappeared. He peeked inside hesitantly, his legs braced as if to run, and then\nglanced over his shoulder before calling out, “Hello?”\n“Yeah, I’m over here,” Michel said, waving. “You’re late.”\n“I couldn’t find the place.”\n“Stupid excuse.”\n“Pardon?”\nMichel held up his beer, examining the young man through the glass.\nYoung man? A boy, more like it. Couldn’t be older than sixteen, barely even\na scruff of beard on his chin. He was short for his age, a little bit\noverweight, but with the kind of plain face that could disappear into the\ncrowd. Not all that different from Michel, which wasn’t surprising. It was,"

    "text": "overweight, but with the kind of plain face that could disappear into the\ncrowd. Not all that different from Michel, which wasn’t surprising. It was,\nafter all, the first thing the Blackhats looked for in a spy.\n“A stupid excuse,” Michel repeated. The young man wore high-legged\ntrousers, a flat-cut jacket, and a scarf in the style of a poor man’s cravat.\nThe outfit was three years out of date, and it irritated Michel. “Not being\nable to find an address makes you look either a fool or an asshole. Both of\nthose can come in useful at one time or another, but not as often as you’d\nthink. Nobody likes a fool or an asshole, and the first thing you need to be\nis likable, or else you won’t blend in anywhere.”\nThe young man cast a confused glance around the bar, his eyes slightly\nwide as if he’d stumbled onto the lair of a crazy person. “Are you Mickle?”\nhe asked.\n“Michel,” Michel corrected, putting an emphasis on the second half of\nthe name. “Me-Kell. My name doesn’t rhyme with ‘pickle.’”\n“Right,” the young man said slowly. “I’m Dristan. Are you the guy\nwho’s supposed to teach me how to be a spy?”\n“Likable people,” Michel continued, ignoring the question, “are\ninformed. They say please and thank you. They ask for directions. They are\npunctual. You’re going to be all these things, or you’re not going to be able\nto do your job. At best, the people you’re sent to observe will reject you. At\nworst, they’ll find out you’re not who you claim to be and kill you very\nslowly.” Michel sighed, finishing his beer and telling himself he shouldn’t\ndrink another one. “You’re not a spy,” he said. “You’re going to be what we\ncall a ‘passive informant.’ You’ll become someone else, immersing yourself\nentirely into a life that is not your own, and leak information about unrest,\ncrimes, and plots against the government to your handler.”\nDristan looked more than a little pensive. He remained standing,\nuncertain of himself, still seeming like he might run at any moment.\nMichel continued: “Don’t dress like a lower-class dandy. It makes you\nmemorable, and you rarely want to be memorable. Wear short trousers and\na light-colored shirt. Maybe a flatcap. You can never go wrong dressing like\na common laborer.” Michel whirled his finger in the direction of Dristan’s\nhead. “That look you have on your face: that hesitant, nervous thing. You\nwant to start practicing not making that face. It’s suspicious. Now, tell me\nyour name.”\n“I told you I’m Dristan.”\n“No,” Michel said, slamming the palm of his hand on the table. Dristan\njumped. “Tell me your name.”\n“I’m Dri…” Dristan paused. “My name is, uh, Plinnith.”\nHe catches on quicker than most of the people I teach to do this.\n“Plinnith? What kind of a name is Plinnith? That’s a stupid name.”\n“Hey, I’ve heard it around before!” Dristan protested."

That’s a stupid name.”\n“Hey, I’ve heard it around before!” Dristan protested.\nMichel rolled his eyes. “Plinnith is a stupid name,” he repeated slowly.\n“What kind is it?”\nDristan stared at him as if wondering what, exactly, he was asking for,\nbefore his eyes suddenly lit up. “Oh, oh! Plinnith. It’s Brudanian.”\n“That where you’re from?” Michel asked, continuing the mock\ninterrogation.\n“I’m not. My, um, my mother was Brudanian. Came from a fishing\nvillage there.”\n“Oh yeah? My best friend is from a fishing village in Brudania. Maybe\nit’s the same place.”\n“I don’t remember the name,” Dristan answered.\n“Oh, that’s too bad. What are you doing in Landfall, Plinnith?”\n“Dad was a farmer out near Redstone. He died last fall, so Mom’s sent\nme to the capital for work.”\nMichel continued to fire questions at the boy, going on for almost five\nminutes, needling him for details that normal people wouldn’t possibly ask\nfor before he finally gave it a rest. He dropped the pretense, poured himself\nanother beer, and said, “Not half-bad.”\nThe boy beamed back at him.\n“Not great, either,” Michel continued. “I didn’t believe a damned word\nof it.”\n“But you already know I’m not a farmer’s son named Plinnith!” Dristan\nprotested.\n“Do I?” Michel shrugged. “You have no idea what I know. It’s your job\nto convince me you’re the person you say you are.” He swirled the beer\naround, wishing for the thousandth time that there was a better way to do\nthis. Kids came off the street all the time, looking to join the Blackhats.\nMost of them became low-level enforcers, roughing up anyone who spoke\nout against the Lady Chancellor. The smart ones might become political\nliaisons or pencil-pushers. The rest became informants, spying on the very\npopulation the Lady Chancellor governed.\nInformants had the most dangerous job and got the least amount of\ntraining. What good was an informant, after all, if anyone spotted them\nhanging around with a known Blackhat? The best they could expect was a\nfew days in an out-of-the-way spot with someone like Michel – an\nexperienced informant who’d lived long enough to become a bureaucrat.\nPeople knew Michel was a Blackhat, of course. They just didn’t know he’d\nclimbed the ranks by selling out his neighbors.\n“Look,” Michel said. “It’s all about relating to people.”\n“What do you mean?” Dristan asked.\n“You and me, we’re Kressians, right? I mean, we call ourselves\nFatrastan, but even if we were born here our grandparents were born in the\nNine. Follow?”\n“I think?”\n“Now, our grandparents might have hated each other back in the old\ncountry. Maybe yours were Kez, mine were Adran. Mortal enemies. But\nonce they’d come over the ocean they now had something in common. So\nthey put aside their old hatreds and now they just call themselves\nFatrastans. Right?”"

    "text": "once they’d come over the ocean they now had something in common. So\nthey put aside their old hatreds and now they just call themselves\nFatrastans. Right?”\nDristan didn’t look impressed. “I suppose…”\nMichel cut him off. “They related. They found out what they had in\ncommon and worked together. During the revolution all of us who\nconsidered ourselves Fatrastan worked with the Palo against the Kez.\nAnother instance of relating against a common enemy.”\n“But Fatrastans and Palo hate each other now.”\n“Sure. Because loyalties change once they’re no longer convenient.\nRemember, informants have to blend in. The loyalties you wear on your\nsleeve have to match the people around you. It’s a kind of theatrics, and a\ngood actor will tell you that the best way to get into a character’s head will\nbe by relating to them, even if they’re the villain. To inform on enemies of\nthe state, you have to think like one; to become one.” He made an\nexpansive gesture. “That’s spycraft, summed up.”\n“I thought we weren’t spies.”\n“‘Informantcraft’ isn’t a word,” Michel said. He squinted around the\nbar, scrunching his face, and considered another drink. Maybe just half a\nglass.\n“You seem older than you look,” Dristan observed.\nMichel headed around the bar toward the tap. “It’s because I know what\nI’m about. Learn confidence – or at least how to feign it – and everyone\nwill assume you’re ten years older than you really are. Helps to know your\ncraft, too, and in this case my craft is keeping an eye on the Lady\nChancellor’s people.” Michel put the glass up against the barrel, holding it\nthere for several moments before opening the tap.\nDristan seemed like a good kid. He might just be smart enough to make\nit through a few years of spying. Michel would give him an extra day or\ntwo of training, but he’d already decided to give Silver Rose Salacia – the\nperson who would be Dristan’s handler – the thumbs-up. Unfortunately, in\nthis line of work toss them in the bay and hope they learn to swim was the\nmost efficient method of training. “What do you get out of this?” he asked,\nfilling a second beer and sliding it down the bar to Dristan.\n“I get a Rose, don’t I?”\nThe Roses were the Blackhat badge of authority, medallions that gave\nthem their names – an Iron or Bronze Rose indicated a low rank, Brass or\nSilver a mid-rank, and Gold – well, Gold Roses were the Blackhat elites,\nprivy to all the secrets and machinations of the Fatrastan government. They\nran the country on behalf of the Lady Chancellor and held the wealth of the\ncontinent in their palms. Everyone coveted the Gold Roses. Few got them.\nBut even getting an Iron Rose could be a huge step up for someone\nfrom the slums like Dristan. If Dristan survived a mission or two he might\njump straight up to a Brass Rose.\n“Other than the Rose,” Michel said.\nDristan took a drink, looking down at his hands for a long moment, then\nsaid, “The Blackhats will take care of my sisters. Keep them fed, housed,"

Keep them fed, housed,\nout of the whorehouses. They’ll take care of them even if I die, so long as I\nremain loyal.”\nMichel nodded. It was a common enough story. A lot of horrible shit\nwas said about the Blackhats – most of it true – but they always took care of\ntheir own. “A piece of advice for you,” he said. “You’ve got a life right\nnow, a family, happy memories?” He held out his hand, pointing to invisible\nobjects on his palm.\n“Yeah.”\n“When you go into cover, you have to become someone else entirely.\nDon’t think about your old life, not even for a second, or you may betray\nyourself in a weak moment. Eat, sleep, breathe, even think like Plinnith the\nfarmer’s son, or whoever the pit you become.” He made a fist. “Take all\nthose happy thoughts and put them into a little marble in the back corner of\nyour brain and don’t even look at it until the job is finished. I’m not an\ninformant anymore – just a midlevel Blackhat serving at her Lady\nChancellor’s pleasure – but I was in your spot once. The marble trick is\nhow I got through it.”\n“You were a spy – er, an informant?”\n“Why do you think I’m sitting here telling you all this? I’ve been\nundercover three times, which is twice too many for someone operating in a\nsingle city. It’s a miracle nobody recognized me those second and third\nstints. But it also means I’ve done this a lot, so I get a few hours to pass on\nmy experience to somebody like you.”\n“Why did you do it?”\nMichel considered the question for a moment. “Like you, I did it for the\nRose.” He looped a thumb through the cord around his neck and showed\nDristan the silver medallion that dangled against his chest at all times. “I\nalso did it for Fatrasta,” he said honestly. “Because I wanted to make a\ndifference.”\n“Did you make a difference?”\n“When you finish your first assignment, come and find me. I’ll tell you\nabout the Powder Mage Affair.” Michel looked at his half-full glass and set\nit on the bar, more than a little annoyed with himself. Four glasses of beer\nbefore seven in the morning was excessive, even by his standards. There\nwas a sudden thump, bringing Michel’s head around, and the door to the\npub suddenly opened.\nA familiar face peered in. It was a man in a black, long-sleeved shirt\nwith a row of black buttons up the left breast and matching black trousers –\nthe typical uniform of the Lady Chancellor’s secret police. He was missing\na button from his left cuff, which irritated Michel to no end. He wore a\nBrass Rose openly pinned to his shirt. “Agent Bravis, sir,” he said.\n“Son of a… Damn it, Warsim, this is a safe house.

His foul mood was just finally starting\nto turn for the better and Warsim had to show up and ruin his favorite safe\nhouse. “What the pit is it?”\nWarsim ducked his head, grimacing. “Sorry, sir. I didn’t have much of a\nchoice. You’ve been summoned to the grand master’s office. Fidelis Jes\nwants to see you.”\n“Why?” Michel was taken aback. He wasn’t a Gold Rose. He had no\ndealings with the grand master. A cold sweat broke out on the back of his\nneck. “Me? He asked for me by name?”\n“That’s what I was told.”\nMichel pushed away his beer and desperately hoped he’d have time to\nsober up. Pit, he was sober now. Being called into the grand master’s office\nwas like being dunked in the bay. “Right. What time?”\n“You have an appointment for eight fifteen.”\nMichel checked his watch and glanced over at Dristan. “Get out of\nhere,” he said. “Lesson canceled.”\n“Should I come back tomorrow?”\n“No. If things work out, I’ll come find you soon and we’ll get you back\nin training.”\n“And if not?”\nMichel double-checked his watch. The grand master. Bloody pit.\n“Forget we ever spoke.”\nCHAPTER 3\n“P\nrogress.”\nIt was an unimposing word, and not even that particularly fun to say, but\nit was bandied about in the newspapers so much that you’d think it was the\nname of Fatrasta’s new god. As if Fatrasta, a land of bickering immigrants,\na twice-stolen nation of industrialized robbery, would ever spawn its own\ngod. Landfall, the capital city of Fatrasta, would chew up a god and spit it\nout and it would barely make the newspapers.\nStyke sat squeezed on an uncomfortable wooden bench in a narrow\nhallway. There were half a dozen others on the same bench – broken, beaten\nmen who looked twenty years older than their age. They stared at the floor\nor the ceiling, avoiding eye contact, either praying or buried in their own\ndesperate thoughts. Light streamed in through a high, barred window, and\nsomeone with a rickety cough hacked out their lungs in a nearby room.\nOn Styke’s lap was a worn, four-month-old newspaper, with PROGRESS\nemblazoned across the front of the first page. He considered the word for\nseveral minutes and thought of ripping the paper up as a way to vent the\ndisgust it caused in him, but it was hard enough to get a newspaper in the\nlabor camps and he’d traded a week’s tobacco ration for this one.\nInstead, he produced a semi-carved piece of wood, clutching it as tightly\nas he could manage with his mangled left hand. With his right he began\nworking at the wood with a small knife he’d stolen from the mess hall,\nthumb on the back of the blade, shaving bits off mechanically as he read.\nThe newspaper reported Adran mercenaries hard at work “taming the\nfrontier.” Landfall was to open three more labor camps around the city to\naccommodate convicts shipped over from the Nine.

Riots had broken out in\nthe Palo quarter over the public hanging of a young radical. Trade had still\nnot normalized with Kez, despite their civil war ending six years ago.\nStyke snorted. The world, as he determined from the contents of any\nnewspaper he could get his hands on, had changed little in the ten years\nsince his sentencing. It was still filled with the greedy, violent, poor, angry,\nand not much else. He shifted his attention from the paper to the carving in\nhis hand, whittling details into the soft pine for the next several minutes.\nHe held his handiwork up to the morning light. It wasn’t a bad little\ncanoe, if he did say so himself. It was as long as his palm, thin and sleek,\nthe outside covered in Palo markings. Certainly well done despite a dull\nknife and a crippled hand. He blew shavings off the back of his arm, then\nfolded his newspaper and forced himself to stand, scowling as it took his\nright leg just a few seconds too long to obey his command.\nHe walked to the door leading into the courtyard and opened it a crack.\nJust outside waiting on the stoop was a young girl, though one might have\neasily mistaken her for a boy behind the mask of grime and filth that came\nfrom living in a labor camp. She was barefoot, wearing an old shirt of\nStyke’s that had to be tied at the neck and waist to keep it from falling off.\nShe looked like a starving sparrow with half its feathers plucked out.\n“Celine,” he whispered.\nThe girl perked up, turning her head. “Ben! You get out?” she asked\nexcitedly.\nStyke shook his head. “Haven’t even gone inside yet,” he responded.\n“Here.” He slipped the canoe through the crack before a guard could notice\nthe door was open. “It might be a couple hours.”\n“I’ll wait.”\nStyke closed the door quietly and limped back to his seat, suppressing a\ngroan as he lowered himself onto the hard bench. One of the other inmates\nglanced toward the door, then over at him, but quickly lowered his gaze.\nOnly a few minutes passed before a door opened at the far end of the\nhallway and a guard appeared. Styke couldn’t remember his name, but he\nknew he’d served in the Kez army as military police back before the war.\nHe was a big man, taller than most with forearms as big around as powder\nkegs. The guard looked out across the sorry lot on the bench and whirled his\ntruncheon absently. He wore the same sunflower-yellow smocks as the\nother guards, a facsimile of the Fatrastan military jackets that Styke himself\nused to wear.\nHe glared at Styke. “You,” he said. “Convict 10642. You’re up.”\nStyke climbed to his feet and limped toward the guard.\n“Hurry it up there,” the guard said. “I haven’t got all day.”\nI wonder, Styke thought to himself, what you’d look like without arms."

He knew what kind of attention his size\nattracted. It was never good, not here. Guards liked to make examples of the\nbiggest inmates to keep everyone else in line.\nI could squash you like a bug. The thought came unbidden, and Styke\nquickly suppressed it. No room for that kind of thinking here. He was a\nmodel inmate, and he’d continue to be until his time was done, or else he’d\nbe here until they worked him to death. A brief memory flashed through his\nmind – blood-spattered gauntlets on his fists, sword in hand, belting out a\nlancer’s hymn as he waded, unhorsed, through enemy grenadiers, each one\nas big as this arrogant guard. He blinked, and the vision was gone.\nThe guard finally took a step back and held the door open for Styke,\ndirecting him down another dusty hall with only a single window. “First\ndoor on the right.”\nStyke followed the instructions and soon found himself in a small, brick\nroom. It reminded him of a confessional at a Kresim church, though instead\nof a wicker screen between him and the next room over, there was a thick,\niron grate over the window. Above it was a sign in broad letters that said\nPAROLE. The room was well lit, probably so the judge could get a good\nlook at the monster he was about to let loose on the world.\n“Please sit,” a voice said from behind the iron grate.\nStyke sat on a low wooden stool, nervously listening to it creak beneath\nhis bulk.\nSeveral moments of silence followed, until Styke lifted his gaze from\nthe floor to peer through the iron grate. He’d been through this process\ntwice before now, and he knew the song and dance. Parole judges were\nsimply whichever senior prison administrator had the time for you, meaning\nthat the difference between freedom and another two years of hard labor\ndepended heavily on whether they’d gotten up on the right side of the bed\nthat morning.\nWhat Styke saw on the other side of the grate made his heart sing.\n“Raimy?” he asked.\nFour-thumb Raimy wasn’t much to look at. She was a middle-aged\nwoman, small and unimposing, with a pair of spectacles dangling on a\nchain around her neck, and dressed in what passed for a smart suit in the\nlabor camps. She was the camp accountant and quartermaster. Being one of\nthe few inmates who could read, write, and do sums, Styke had helped her\nwith the books on more than one occasion. He liked the quiet of her office,\nwhere Celine could play on the floor and he could stay out of trouble.\nRaimy coughed. She shuffled through her papers, picked up her pencil,\nand promptly fumbled, letting it roll across the desk and onto the floor.\nInstead of retrieving it, she carefully plucked a new one from her front\njacket pocket and tested the tip.\n“Benjamin,” she said."

You know the dust on these\ndry days. How’s your knee?”\nStyke shrugged. “Hurts. Friend of mine got that cough once, back\nduring the war. He added honey to his whiskey. Didn’t clear it up\ncompletely, but it sure made him less miserable.”\n“I’ll keep that in mind.” She cleared her throat, the sound turning into a\ncoughing fit, then shuffled through her papers once more before continuing\non in a formal tone. “Convict 10642, Benjamin Styke. Your ten-year parole\nhearing has begun. Is there anyone to speak for you?”\nStyke glanced around the tiny room. “I’m not allowed letters or outside\ncommunication, so I’m not sure if anyone even knows I’m still alive.”\n“I see,” Raimy said. She checked a box on the paper in front of her,\nmuttering, “no advocates,” before continuing on in her formal tone.\n“Benjamin Styke, you were sentenced to the firing squad for disobeying\norders from your superior officer during the revolution. Your sentence was\nreduced by the grace of the Lady Chancellor to twenty years of hard labor.\nIs this correct?”\n“I wouldn’t say reduced,” Styke said, holding up his mangled hand and\nspreading the fingers as well as he could. “They gave it two goes before\ndeciding it would be easier to have me dig trenches than soak up bullets.”\nRaimy’s eyes widened and the formal tone disappeared. “Two volleys\nfrom the firing squad? I had no idea.”\n“That was my crime,” he confirmed, lowering his hand. “And my\nsentence.”\nRaimy coughed, dropped another pencil, and fetched a new one before\nchecking a box. “Right. Well, Mr. Styke, I’ve spent the last hour reviewing\nyour case. You’ve gone seven years since a violent incident and five since\nany marks have been made against your record. Considering the, uh” – she\ncleared her throat – “average life span of an inmate at Sweetwallow Labor\nCamp is only about six years, I’d say you’ve done very well for yourself.”\nStyke found himself sitting on the edge of the stool, ignoring the\nprotests from his bad knee as he leaned forward. “Have I been granted\nparole?” he breathed, not daring to show the elation growing inside him.\n“I think…” Raimy was cut off by a sudden knock on the door on her\nside of the grate. She frowned, setting her pencil down carefully, and stood\nup to answer it. “One moment,” she told him, then stepped outside.\nStyke could hear muted voices on the other side of the room, but\nnothing loud enough to understand. The voices suddenly grew louder, until\nRaimy broke into a coughing fit. Silence followed, then Raimy came back\ninside the room.\nShe had another piece of paper in her hand, and she carefully set it flat\non the table, then slid it beneath the rest of his file.

She stared at the desk,\none finger drumming nervously.\nStyke didn’t know what this meant, but it couldn’t be good. He was\nalmost falling off his stool now, and wanted to reach through the iron grate\nand shake her. “Parole,” he said helpfully.\nRaimy seemed to snap out of her reverie and looked up at him, smiling.\n“Ah, where was I? Yes, well, I have good news and bad news, Mr. Styke.\nThe bad news is that I must, in good conscience, deny you parole.” She\ncontinued on quickly: “The good news is that I am able to offer you a\ntransfer to a labor camp with a less… dangerous reputation. Soft labor, as\nsome of us like to call it.” She let out a nervous chuckle, coughed, and\ncontinued: “The beds will be softer, the hours shorter, and the facilities\nbetter.”\nStyke stared, his heart falling. “Another labor camp?” he asked flatly.\nHe felt in shock, as if he’d been punched in the gut. “This is my life. Do\nyou think I care if my bed is a little softer?”\nA bead of sweat rolled down Raimy’s temple.\n“I know you can let me out,” Styke said, slapping the wall with his good\nhand. The sound made Raimy jump. “I know it’s up to your discretion. I’ve\nkept my head down for ten years. I’ve taken beatings without a protest, I’ve\nstarved when the gruel is thin. Bloody pit, I taught you to read after you\nfaked your way into a job as the camp quartermaster. I thought we were\nfriends, Raimy.”\nRaimy remained still. Her hands lay flat on the table, her eyes straight\nahead like a deer caught in the garden. Her only movement was a violent\ntremble moving up and down her body. “I’m sorry,” she said quietly.\n“Sorry? Sorry for what?”\n“I didn’t know you were that Ben Styke.”\n“What do you mean by that Ben Styke? How many of us do you think\nthere are?” Styke stood up, barely feeling the twinge in his knee through the\nanger. His head grazed the ceiling of the parole cell. For some reason, the\ntremble going through Raimy’s body made him even angrier. They’d spent\ncountless days together in her unguarded office, even had a few laughs\ntogether. She’d flirted with him. And now she was shaking, terrified, even\nthough she was behind an iron grate? “Are we friends?” he demanded.\n“Yes,” Raimy squeaked.\nStyke wrapped his good hand and the two working fingers of his bad\nhand around the bars of the grate. He tightened his grip and, with one solid\nyank, ripped it out of the wall. Raimy’s mouth fell open but she remained\ntransfixed as he set the grate to one side and leaned in over her desk, fishing\nthrough her papers until he came to the last one.\nIt was a note on stationery from the office of the Lady Chancellor.

It had\nthree sentences:\nMad Ben Styke, formerly Colonel Styke of the Mad Lancers, is a violent\nmurderer guilty of several war crimes. He must be denied parole. Make it\nconvincing.\nIt was signed by Fidelis Jes, head of the Lady Chancellor’s secret\npolice.\nStyke could hear someone yelling in the hallway. They’d heard the\nracket, and the yelling was soon followed by the pounding footsteps of the\nguards. Styke crumpled up the note and flicked it into Raimy’s face. “You\ncan stop your damned trembling, then. I don’t hurt my friends.”\nHe turned away from her, spreading his arms wide, and waited for the\nfirst guard to come through the door.\nCHAPTER 4\nM\nichel was in a tiny, out-of-the-way neighborhood called Proctor, about\na mile and a half west of the docks and two hundred feet above them in\nthe very center of the Landfall Plateau. Favored by pensioned veterans and\nsmall immigrant families, Proctor wasn’t a great part of town, but it wasn’t\na slum like Greenfire Depths, either. Most people couldn’t find it on a map,\nand that made it a good place to stay out of trouble. Or in Michel’s case,\nkeep someone else out of trouble.\nFidelis Jes wants to see you.\nThe words frayed Michel’s nerves in a way that very few sentences\ncould. It was just an hour after canceling his training session, and he paused\nto read the note Warsim had handed him. It was on embossed stationery\nmarked with a Platinum Rose. No mistaking that signature. Only two\npeople in Fatrasta had a Platinum Rose – Fidelis Jes, and the Lady\nChancellor herself.\nWhat could the grand master want with a Silver Rose? Michel had seen\nFidelis Jes on many occasions at headquarters. They’d even exchanged a\nfew words. But Michel had never been summoned to his office.\nPerhaps, he reasoned, it was a mistake. Or perhaps he’d be meeting with\nsomeone else in the grand master’s office. A niggling fear in the back of his\nhead told him that he’d let something slip to the wrong person and he was\nto be brought up on charges against the state. He wanted to dismiss it as a\nridiculous notion, but not even the most loyal Blackhat was beyond\nreproach. Surely, he decided, he’d have woken up in a cell if that were the\ncase.\n“The wrong word at the wrong time,” he muttered to himself, “can lose\nyou your head in this city.”\nHe smiled reassuringly at his reflection in a nearby shop window.\n“You’re a damned good Blackhat. You’ll be fine.”\n“Says you. Look, just take care of this thing and then you can go get\nyour face stomped in by the grand master.”\nHe checked his pocket watch. His meeting with the grand master was in\nforty-five minutes. He’d want to be early but, he thought as he eyed the\nhouse across the street, there were some things more important than work,\nand this was one of them.

He crossed the street, taking the alleyway around to the back\ndoor, and was inside after slipping the lock with the blade of his knife.\nThe little house wasn’t much to see. It had one room with a loft bed\nupstairs. The table and both chairs were covered in old penny novels. There\nwas a rocker over by the window, empty, with a red shawl draped over the\nback. The air smelled strongly of lavender, likely to cover up the underlying\nscent of mildew. It took him only a moment to find the source of the latter –\na pile of books in the corner, soaked through, with the telltale yellow streaks\non the plaster above them that indicated a leaky roof.\nMichel sighed and cleared away some of the books, making room for\nthe box of food he carried under one arm. He made a quick circuit of the\ntiny house, noting cracks in the plaster, a second leak in the roof, and that\none of the chairs was being held together by a length of tightly bound cord.\nHe bent over, rubbing his finger gently over a break in the front window\npane, when he caught sight of a short, plump woman walking down the\nstreet. Her long, reddish-brown hair had begun to gray at the temples, and\nher dress was threadbare. She walked with a brisk, determined stride and\nheld a sack stuffed with penny novels in one hand, smiling and waving at\neveryone she passed.\nFirst of the month, Michel remembered. The day the bookstores put out\ntheir latest dreadfuls.\n“You should say hi,” he said to himself.\n“To the pit with that. I don’t have time.”\n“You’re a terrible son.”\n“I know.”\nHe ran to the back door, slipping out into the alley just as he heard his\nmother’s loud greeting to her neighbors and the fumbling of a key at the\nfront door.\nHe felt a wave of relief as he returned to the main road, the close call\nbehind him. Visiting his mother inevitably led to a fight, and he didn’t need\nthat right now, not with a meeting with the grand master looming over his\nhead.\nA thought struck him. Perhaps his years of hard work had been noticed.\nMaybe he wasn’t going to the grand master’s office for punishment, but\nrather for a reward. He blinked through a drop of sweat that rolled into his\neye, a brief fantasy playing through his head. He could be getting a\npromotion to Gold Rose. His friends would never buy another drink. His\nrelations would live in big houses near the capitol.\nHe wouldn’t have to slip his mother boxes of food because she spent her\npension on penny novels.\nHe quashed the thought, not daring to hope, and decided to put on his\nbest face. Whatever it was Fidelis Jes wanted, Michel would be a\nprofessional. The grand master could not be charmed or flattered. He\nrespected power and competence. Michel couldn’t offer the first. The\nsecond… well, Michel was very good at his job.\nThe not-so-secret headquarters of the Landfall Secret Police, known\ncolloquially as the Millinery, was located just a few blocks down the road"

    "text": "second… well, Michel was very good at his job.\nThe not-so-secret headquarters of the Landfall Secret Police, known\ncolloquially as the Millinery, was located just a few blocks down the road\nfrom the capitol building. The Millinery was an austere palace, a thoroughly\nmodern construction of black granite with few windows on the first floor\nand castle-like battlements on the roof. It was the official face of the\nBlackhats, set up with barracks, holding cells, training yards, and offices\nthat encompassed two whole city blocks. They even had a division just to\ntake public complaints.\nThe resemblance to a regular police house was not, Michel suspected,\naccidental. The Lady Chancellor wanted people to trust the Blackhats.\nFat chance of that.\nBut public relations was not, thankfully, part of Michel’s job. He\nentered through the wicket gate on Lindet Avenue, tipping his hat to Keln,\nthe old gatekeeper standing just inside the door, before winding his way\nthrough the halls of the Millinery until he reached the northeast corner on\nthe fourth floor. He dabbed the sweat from his face with a handkerchief,\nstraightened his vest, and entered the offices of Fidelis Jes.\nThe grand master’s offices consisted of two rooms – a small\nantechamber with a desk and waiting chairs, and a much larger office\nbehind it, the double doors open to reveal a brightly lit room, decorated\nwith colorful Kressian murals and furnished with mahogany furniture. The\nmahogany didn’t surprise him – Fidelis Jes struck him as a mahogany sort\nof man – but the colors and light certainly did. Michel had expected\nsomething far more dour for the offices of a man who, among his many\ntitles, was counted as the master of assassins.\n“Michel Bravis here to see the grand master,” he said to the secretary.\nThe secretary was a middle-aged woman with delicate, elfin features,\nshort black hair, and excellent posture. She smiled at Michel from behind\nher desk and he sought to remember her name. Dellina. That was it. A\nStarlish who’d been with Fidelis Jes since just after the war. Jes’s only\nconfidante, other than the Lady Chancellor herself. Michel wondered how\nmany state secrets Dellina had floating around in her head.\n“You’re his eight fifteen?” Dellina asked.\n“That’s right,” Michel responded. “Michel Bravis.”\n“Of course.” Dellina beamed in that warm but oddly condescending\nway that only secretaries could manage. “Agent Bravis. Thank you so much\nfor coming in on such short notice. The grand master is running just a little\nbit late today, so if you have any morning appointments I can have a\nmessenger at your disposal.”\nMichel frowned. “For what?”\n“To delay any other appointments you may have. For your meeting with\nthe grand master.”\n“Oh! Of course. No, that won’t be necessary.”\n“Very good. You can have a seat just over there.”\nMichel had barely dropped into a chair and begun an examination of the\nroom when the door burst open and Fidelis Jes strode through it. Michel\nleapt to his feet, hands behind his back, shoulders squared at attention. Jes\ndidn’t seem to notice. He was wearing a pair of formfitting trousers and a"

He was wearing a pair of formfitting trousers and a\nflowing white shirt, most of the buttons undone, his clothes soaked through\nwith sweat.\n“You’re late, sir,” Dellina said in a disapproving tone.\nJes flipped a hand dismissively. “Construction,” he said. “My normal\nroute has been blocked off by a new series of public tenements Lindet has\ngoing in. Make a note for me to skip Hawthdun Street tomorrow.”\n“Of course, sir. Your three eight o’clocks and your eight fifteen are all\nwaiting, sir.”\nFidelis Jes was often referred to as an ideal specimen of human fitness\nby the city’s gossip columns and Michel could find no argument against it.\nJes had a finely chiseled chest, shoulders and arms to match, and legs that\nwould make an athlete weep. He was supposedly in his forties but didn’t\nlook a day over thirty, with refined cheekbones that gave him a haughty,\nmemorable face. Rumor had it that Jes jogged around the base of the\nLandfall Plateau every single morning. Michel had never seen him jogging\npersonally and assumed it was some kind of in-joke among the Gold Roses.\nYet here he was, soaked with sweat, first thing in the morning.\nJes entered his office and closed the doors behind him. His voice came\nout muffled. “Who the pit is that?”\n“That’s your eight fifteen, sir. Michel Bravis. He’s the Silver Rose you\ntold me to fetch.”\n“Right.” The following silence was punctuated by a muffled curse, then\nthe doors sprang open. Jes’s face was washed, dark brown hair slicked\nblack, and he had changed into an identical, but clean, outfit. He buckled on\na belt with a smallsword. “Where are my eight o’clocks?”\n“In the courtyard, sir,” Dellina answered.\nJes strode over to Michel, who found his throat suddenly very dry as the\ngrand master examined him first from one side, then another. “Bravis,” Jes\nsaid, emphasizing the “B.” “Come with me.”\nWithout another word, he strode out of the room. Feeling slightly\nalarmed, Michel glanced at Dellina, who gave him an apologetic smile and\nhurried after her master. “We’re normally much more organized,” she said\nas she passed. “But the Lady Chancellor’s construction!”\nMichel ran after the two, catching up as they descended to the third\nfloor. Fidelis Jes walked with his head cocked to one side, only answering\nwith a grunted yes or no while Dellina whispered in his ear. They reached\nthe main floor and headed out into the courtyard, where Dellina hurried\nacross to three men waiting in the morning sun. All three held smallswords,\nand Michel suddenly knew what Jes’s eight o’clock appointments were. His\nstomach clenched.\n“I’m so sorry,” he heard Dellina saying to the three men. “There was\nconstruction this morning on the grand master’s run and it’s resulted in a\ndelay. You have our deepest apologies.” She left the three standing there,\nlooking angry and perplexed, and returned to Jes. “The one on the right is"

Says you slept with his wife last week.”\n“Did I?”\n“Yes. The one on the left says you ordered the execution of his brother. I\ncan’t find any records under the name but he claims it’s true. I have no idea\nwho the Palo in the middle is. Says he just wants a good fight.”\nIn Michel’s experience, everyone had at least one peculiarity. Powerful\npeople tended to have more extreme peculiarities because of their wealth.\nSome of them were hidden, some out in the open. Fidelis Jes’s was\nextremely public; even advertised. He had a standing invitation for anyone\nto try to kill him in single combat. No sorcery, no guns, no quarter. Michel\nforced himself to breathe slowly as he watched, feeling like he was in some\nkind of farcical play. He knew about the grand master’s appointments, of\ncourse. He’d just never seen one personally.\nJogging aside, it was said that Fidelis Jes had not truly started his day\nuntil he’d had a cup of coffee and killed a man.\n“Right,” Jes said sharply. “I’m already behind schedule.” Jes strode\ntoward the three men, pointing at each in succession with his sword. “You\nfirst, you second, you third.” The last word was barely out of his mouth\nwhen he leapt at the first combatant. They crossed swords once and Jes’s\nblade tore out his throat. Jes was on the second combatant in two strides,\nand stabbed him through the heart before he’d even raised his sword.\nThe third combatant, the Palo, watched the other two fights, his eyes on\nJes’s footwork. He intercepted the grand master before the second fighter\nhad even hit the ground and Jes fell back several steps. They crossed swords\nalmost a dozen times before Jes disarmed him, stabbed him once in the\nstomach, then discarded his own sword and wrapped his fingers around his\nthroat, driving the Palo to his knees. The Palo died of strangulation before\nhe even had the chance to bleed out. Michel let out a sigh, not even\nrealizing he’d been holding his breath, and hoped the queasiness he felt\ndidn’t show on his face.\nDellina handed Jes a handkerchief. “Well done, sir.”\nJes dabbed his forehead, then cleaned his sword as a pair of men\nemerged from the other side of the courtyard and began loading the bodies\ninto a wheelbarrow. “The Palo was pretty good.”\n“He held up well,” Dellina agreed.\n“Find out where the pit a Palo learned to duel like a Kressian. Those\nsavages shouldn’t have access to dueling lessons.”\n“Of course, sir.”\n“What time is it?”\nDellina checked a pocket watch. “Eight thirteen, sir. Here’s your\ncoffee,” she said, taking a porcelain cup off the tray of a servant.\n“Excellent. Ahead of schedule. Tell me when it’s eight fifteen.” Jes\nclosed his eyes, head back slightly, and sipped his coffee with some relish.\nMichel had no choice but to wait, still at attention, sweat trickling down\nthe small of his back.

    "text": "Michel had no choice but to wait, still at attention, sweat trickling down\nthe small of his back. He watched the third body – the one belonging to the\nPalo – as it was loaded onto the others on the wheelbarrow. The cobbles\nwere slick with blood, and he couldn’t help but wonder just how many men\nFidelis Jes had murdered in such a fashion. Hundreds. Perhaps thousands.\nWas there a purpose to it, other than to show that he could?\nMaybe he was going for a record.\nThree murders in just a handful of seconds, and Jes seemed barely\nwinded. Everyone feared Fidelis Jes. He was the Lady Chancellor’s hand of\nvengeance, perhaps the most dangerous man in all of Fatrasta. And that was\nwithout even considering the secret police at his beck and call. Michel was\nused to the threat of violence hanging over his head; when he was\nundercover there was always the risk of being discovered, even tortured and\nkilled. But there was almost always a way out, through charm or force or\nguile. Staring down the tip of Fidelis Jes’s sword seemed as inevitable as a\nguillotine blade and that, to Michel, was infinitely more terrifying.\nHe said a little prayer to whatever god might be listening that he would\nnever find himself in such a situation.\n“It’s eight fifteen, sir,” Dellina said.\nFidelis Jes handed off his coffee cup. “Bravis, was it?”\n“Yes,” Michel said.\n“Where do I know that name?”\n“The Powder Mage Affair,” Dellina said. “Two years ago.”\nMichel stiffened. Jes raised one eyebrow, and Michel felt like he’d just\nbeen reappraised. “That’s right,” Jes said. “Our informant. Did that end\nsatisfactorily?”\n“Very, sir,” Dellina answered.\nThe wheelbarrow of corpses disappeared down a side path. Michel\ncouldn’t help but glance in that direction, and suddenly Jes was standing\nbeside him, face close enough that Michel could feel his breath.\n“Squeamish?” Jes asked.\nMichel swallowed. “I’m a spy, sir. If I have to kill someone it means I\nhaven’t been careful enough.”\n“Have you ever had to?” Jes asked.\nMichel hesitated. “No, sir.”\n“You will. What’s your current assignment, Agent Bravis?”\n“I’m training informants, sir.”\n“Cancel anything you have on your schedule.” Jes snapped his fingers,\nand Dellina handed him a pamphlet, which he immediately passed to\nMichel. “Do you know what this is?”\nThe pamphlet was printed on the same cheap paper as a penny novel,\nbut only a dozen or so pages thick. There was no printer’s mark, nothing on\nthe cover but the words SINS OF EMPIRE printed in large, blocky letters. It\nlooked entirely unremarkable, like any of the hundreds of pamphlets filled\nwith humor, news, gossip, or religion that circulated around Landfall on a\ndaily basis. Michel flipped through it idly. “I’m familiar with the concept of\na pamphlet, sir. But not this one in particular.”\n“You will be. My people tell me that within the next few days these are\ngoing to be everywhere. Over a hundred thousand of them were printed in\nthe last week and we expect to see them flooding the streets.”"

    "text": "“You will be. My people tell me that within the next few days these are\ngoing to be everywhere. Over a hundred thousand of them were printed in\nthe last week and we expect to see them flooding the streets.”\nMichel found himself holding his breath again. Pamphlets should be\nhandled by the propagandists. He was a spy. “I’m not sure I understand,\nsir.”\n“It’s the worst kind of garbage,” Jes said, sneering at the pamphlet like\nit had just insulted his mother. “It claims to spell out all the crimes of our\nbeloved Lady Chancellor, dragging her name through the mud. It puts forth\nthat she is a dictator, a madwoman bent on forcing a new empire on this\npart of the world. Leftist drivel.”\n“Have we tracked down who printed them, sir?”\n“We have. They were printed by a number of companies across\nLandfall, each of them believing they were working independently on a\nsecret counterespionage project for the Lady Chancellor herself.”\nMichel could barely contain his shock. “It’s antigovernment\npropaganda. How could they possibly think they were working for us?”\n“In your line of work, Agent Bravis, how many people openly question\nthe Blackhats?”\n“None, sir.”\n“Yes, well. The companies were all hired at the same time, by different\nagents, each of them carrying an Iron Rose.”\nMichel’s breath caught in his throat. The Roses were considered\nsacrosanct. As an organization, the Blackhats would tolerate all sorts of\ncrime and corruption around the capital, as long as it didn’t impede\ngovernment business. But when it came to the Roses – nobody pretended to\nhave a Rose who didn’t earn it. “Does the public know about this?”\n“We’re burying the use of the Roses underneath our public\ninvestigation,” Dellina said. “As well as providing plenty of our own\npropaganda. We’ve already lined up a scapegoat – a foreign businessman\nwho will be shown to have printed the pamphlets as a badly timed prank.\nHe’ll be ‘caught’ within the week, fined, and deported, and then we’ll\ngather all of the pamphlets as they hit the street.”\n“That seems wise.”\n“I’m glad you approve,” Fidelis Jes said sarcastically. “I don’t care\nmuch about the propaganda. As far as the fate of the nation goes, one piece\nof antigovernment propaganda, no matter how annoying, is not going to\nbring down the Lady Chancellor. However, I will not stand by and allow\nsome leftist upstart to use Iron Roses to spread lies. That’s why you’re here,\nAgent Bravis.

The pamphlet,\nit seemed, was inconsequential. Fifteen Iron Roses, though… “Does the\nLady Chancellor know?”\n“I would rather she not,” Fidelis Jes said. “You’re no doubt wondering\nwhy I chose you, Agent Bravis.

    "text": "why I chose you, Agent Bravis. We have several skilled investigators within\nthe Blackhats, but they all come from police backgrounds. They’re used to\noperating in the public eye. Their actions are watched by the papers and\nenemy spies. Few people outside this office know how you rose to your\nrank. No one has their eyes on you. You can – and in fact are trained to –\ntrack down information without anyone else finding out.”\nFidelis Jes exchanged a glance with his secretary and continued.\n“What’s more, Dellina keeps a list. It contains the names of several young,\nambitious Blackhats with bright futures. They must be intelligent,\npreferably self-taught, without many friends or family members. People\nwhose loyalty is unquestioned, yet haven’t risen high enough through the\nranks that they aren’t expendable. Your name is on that list and because\nyour grandmother was a Palo you may be able to move in circles that our\nother agents cannot.”\nMichel flinched at the reminder about his heritage. Nobody liked a\nmixed-blood, and it wasn’t something he advertised. “I see.” Beyond his\nracial background, there were a lot of nice words in that statement. The only\none that he really paid any mind was “expendable.” And he didn’t like it\none bit. “I’ll find the Iron Roses, sir.”\n“You had better.” Fidelis Jes nodded to Dellina, who stepped forward to\nhand Michel a file.\n“In the meantime,” Dellina said, “we have another light assignment for\nyou. We want as few people to know about our internal investigation as\npossible so this is something else that will let you snoop around without\nraising much suspicion. We’ve recalled a nearby mercenary company from\nwork on the frontier in order to take care of some business in Greenfire\nDepths. Do you know about Lady Flint?”\n“The powder mage?” Michel asked.\n“Yes. It’s her company. You’ll be her Blackhat liaison.”\nMichel flipped through the file. Another powder mage. Just great. Two\nyears ago he’d been an informant in central Landfall and had uncovered an\nassassination plot against the Lady Chancellor involving a Deliv powder\nmage. The discovery had earned him his Silver Rose, but now it seemed\nhe’d been, what did the theater people call it? Typecast. Michel snorted. At\nleast this time he and the powder mage were on the same side. “I’ve heard\nincredible things about her.”\n“She’s an arrogant bitch,” Fidelis Jes said, waving his hand in dismissal.\n“She thinks of herself as a principled mercenary, as if such a thing exists.\nTurn her loose on Greenfire Depths and we’ll see how principled she feels\nafter putting down a real Palo riot. The insurrections she’s fought on the\nfrontier will seem like a weekend stroll.”\n“Of course, sir.”\n“She’ll be here this afternoon,” Dellina said kindly. “Keep in touch with\nher, but remember your primary assignment.”\nMichel glanced down at the copy of Sins of Empire in his hand. “I’ll get\nstarted right away.”\n“Very good,” Fidelis Jes said. “Dellina?”\n“Eight twenty-two, sir.

You have breakfast with the Lady Chancellor in\neighteen minutes.”\nJes suddenly seemed to notice he was still carrying the bloody\nhandkerchief he’d used to clean his sword. He discarded it, looking Michel\nup and down once more as if to assess whether he was really up to the job.\nHis expression was not promising. “I have high hopes for you, Agent\nBravis. If you succeed, you will have earned my gratitude. I’m sure you\nknow how valuable that is. If you fail…” He trailed off and strode inside,\nfollowed by Dellina, leaving Michel in the courtyard with a bloody\nhandkerchief and a small Palo janitor scrubbing crimson off the cobbles.\nMichel closed his eyes, forcing himself to ignore the bald threat. “Think\npositive,” he muttered, slapping the pamphlet against his open palm,\nreading the title over and over again. Sins of Empire. “Find the Roses and\nmake my career.”\n“Or,” he countered, “don’t find them, and wind up a spot on the cobbles\nover there.”\n“He wouldn’t actually kill me for a failure.”\n“You so sure of that?”\nMichel didn’t argue that point. “I could earn my Gold Rose.”\n“Maybe,” he responded, his own voice a little too ominous.\nHe stuffed Sins of Empire into his back pocket and headed in the\nopposite direction across the courtyard, sidestepping the janitor and his\nwork. “Well,” he said to himself, “if I do fail, at least the consequences will\nbe quick.”\nCHAPTER 5\nS\ntyke lay on his back on the floor, staring at the cracked plaster ceiling of\nthe labor camp holding cell. Everything hurt. He rolled over with a\ngroan, hacking up a wad of phlegm and blood and spitting it on the floor.\nHe couldn’t remember the last time he’d been given that good a working\nover. It had been three hours since they’d finished the beating and thrown\nhim in here, but it felt like a lifetime.\nSomewhere nearby, a frantically gathered group of labor camp officials\nwould convene to decide what to do with him. They’d circulate that note\nfrom the Lady Chancellor’s office, trying to read between the lines,\nwondering if they were supposed to keep him alive or if they could get\naway with finishing the job the military had started with a firing squad ten\nyears ago.\nStyke tried to remember if he’d killed anyone after the parole hearing.\nThe whole fight was a bit hazy – screams, swinging truncheons, lashing\nfists. He’d kept his head enough not to draw his whittling knife – which\nthey’d now confiscated – but he remembered breaking at least a few arms.\nHe’d gone into the fight angry, and it was hard to keep his head when he\nwas angry.\nIf he’d murdered a guard or two, he’d swing from the gallows by sunup\nregardless of whether the Lady Chancellor wanted him left alive or not.\nHe wanted to be angry with himself, but couldn’t even muster the\nenergy for that anymore.

All that\nin the vain hope that they’d let him walk after a parole hearing. He’d spend\nthe next six months in the hole, for sure, and after that it would take years\nbefore he got any privileges back.\nHe sat up. To pit with sitting in the hole. What was going to happen to\nCeline? Her dad was dead, sucked under while digging ditches in the\nmarshes. Styke was all she had. Without him, she’d be meat for the guards\nand inmates. She wouldn’t last the season.\n“Eight guards beat the piss out of you, and just a few hours later you’re\nalready sitting up.”\nStyke’s head jerked toward the front of the cell, expecting one of the\nguards in their yellow frocks to be waiting for his turn with a truncheon.\nInstead, he found a man in a black suit and top hat, cane under his arm,\nwearing boots shined to a mirrorlike polish.\nThe man was tall and thin, with the lean shoulders of a duelist. He had a\ndistinctive, hawkish face behind a black goatee and cold blue eyes. He\nlooked to be in his thirties. Taking his cane in one hand, he tapped the cell\nbars. “Most people would never wake up from a beating like that. You\nreally are damned near unkillable, aren’t you?”\nStyke regarded the stranger warily. Nobody dressed that well belonged\nin a labor camp, and certainly not standing outside the holding cells. “You\nsee it happen?” he asked cautiously.\n“I did, actually.” A half smile danced across the stranger’s lips.\n“Did I kill anyone?” Styke asked.\n“Cracked a few heads,” the man said. “But they’ll all survive. It was\nimpressive. I’m happy to see ten years of hard labor haven’t taken the fight\nout of you.”\nStyke peered closer at the stranger, once again feeling like they should\nknow each other. “You know who I am?”\n“Does that surprise you?”\n“I’ve been officially dead for ten years. My own parole judge thought I\nwas ‘some other Ben Styke.’”\nThe man paced up and down the hallway outside Styke’s cell, then\nleaned against the wall as if the dust it would leave on his expensive suit\nwas of little consequence. “Mad Ben Styke was a hero of the revolution.\nThe Mad Lancers were a legend.” He grinned. “Besides, we’ve met before.”\nSomehow, that didn’t surprise Styke. There was something vaguely\nfamiliar about him, like Styke had seen his portrait over someone’s mantel.\n“I don’t remember you.”\n“Gregious Tampo, Esquire,” the man said with a half bow.\n“A lawyer?” Styke asked. “I haven’t met many lawyers.”\n“Not back then,” Tampo said. “I was a soldier. Dragoons attached to the\nThirty-Second Regiment. Defected from the Kez foreign legion when the\nwar started.”\nIn any other country, the word “defector” was a curse.

    "text": "war started.”\nIn any other country, the word “defector” was a curse. But among the\nFatrastans it was a badge of pride. Just about everyone who fought in the\nrevolution against the Kez was a defector of some sort. Styke searched his\nmemory, trying to find some clue that would allow him to recall this\nstranger. But the name meant nothing. Maybe he’d remember something\nonce his ears stopped ringing and the pain faded. “Doesn’t ring a bell. No\noffense.”\n“None taken. We only crossed paths briefly.”\nThere was a time Styke would have embraced a fellow soldier, offered\nhim a beer, and spent the night trading stories. Not anymore. Ghosts from\nthe past rarely boded well in the labor camps. New inmates meant another\nset of someone else’s problems, and new guards meant more habits and\nmentalities to learn. But he found himself taken with this Tampo. Soldiers\nhad an understanding with one another that most people couldn’t grasp – a\nbond forged by victory, violence, and even defeat.\n“Well,” Styke said. He touched the side of his head gingerly, then tried\nto stand up. The guards hadn’t managed to break any bones – it took more\nthan truncheons to crack Ben Styke – but his head swam something fierce\nand it took a few moments to gain his feet without collapsing. He stretched\nhis arms out, touching either side of the cell with his fingertips, working out\nthe kinks in his back. “Thanks for the chat. It’s good to hear someone\nremembers my name. But you’ll want to get out of here before the guards\nreturn.”\n“They won’t be bothering us.”\n“They make rounds pretty often.”\n“A handful of krana makes a strong impression.”\nStyke paused his stretching and blinked through the pain behind his\neyes. “Are you here to see me?” he asked, incredulous. One of those guards\nmust have landed a particularly strong blow to his head. In ten years he’d\nnot had a single visitor.\n“I actually came for your parole hearing,” Tampo said. He tapped his\ncane against the ground a few times, fiddling with the end as if annoyed\nwith himself. “Traffic held me up, so I was ten minutes late. Arrived just in\ntime to see your scuffle with the guards.”\nThis gave Styke pause. “I didn’t even know when my hearing would be\nuntil this morning. How did you?”\n“I have friends.”\nStyke took a half step toward Tampo, stopping just short of the iron\nbars. “You’re not the one who gave my parole officer that note, are you?”\nTampo scowled. “What note?”\nStyke thought about telling Tampo about the note from the Lady\nChancellor’s office, but everything he had to say sounded awfully whiny in\nhis head. Besides, Tampo was a stranger, and Styke had already blabbed too\nmuch. It was best to clam up and wait for judgment from the camp\nadministrators. He paced to the other end of the cell, then back. “So you\nbribed the guards to get to talk with me. I’m guessing it wasn’t just to chat\nabout the war.”\n“No,” Tampo said matter-of-factly. “It’s not.”\n“Then what could you possibly want from me?”\n“I’d like to offer you a job.”"

    "text": "about the war.”\n“No,” Tampo said matter-of-factly. “It’s not.”\n“Then what could you possibly want from me?”\n“I’d like to offer you a job.”\nStyke threw his head back and laughed. It was cut short by a strange\nclicking from his jaw, and the pounding headache that accompanied it. He\nwinced, shaking his head, then met Tampo’s eye. The lawyer was still\nleaning against the wall, and he looked slightly put out at having been\nlaughed at. “By the pit, you’re serious.”\n“Of course I’m serious. You don’t think I’d come all the way down to\nthe labor camp just to make a joke with a man the world thinks is dead, do\nyou?”\n“You going to offer me a job when I get out of here?” Styke retorted.\n“Because that’s likely to be a very long time.”\n“On the contrary.” Tampo checked a pocket watch. “If you accept my\nproposal, I expect you’ll be standing outside the gates of the labor camp\nwithin fifteen minutes.”\n“Bullshit,” Styke said. Any humor or comradeship he felt toward Tampo\nwas gone, replaced by a cold anger. Was he being mocked? Played with?\nWas Tampo an agent of the Lady Chancellor’s, come to toy with him? This\nwas cruel, even by her standards.\n“The work won’t be easy,” Tampo said, as if he didn’t notice the\ndangerous glint in Styke’s eyes. “There’ll be fights, killing, maybe even\nfull-fledged battles, but I expect those are all things you’re used to. I’m\nguessing your old wounds from the firing squad have slowed you down a\nlittle, but based on the brawl with the guards, you’re still more than capable.\nYou’re still Mad Ben Styke.”\nStyke felt a growl rise from the back of his throat. He resisted the urge\nto reach through the bars and squeeze Tampo’s head between his hands until\nit popped.\nTampo’s eyebrows rose slightly and he looked Styke up and down like\none might a newly purchased horse. “Yes, more than capable. Now then, I\nexpect to use you as a tool – a blunt instrument for my own ends, some of\nwhich may be distasteful to you. That won’t be a problem, will it?”\n“Get me out of here,” Styke said, “and I’ll kill the bloody queen of Novi\nif you’d like.”\n“Excellent. Guards!” A pair of yellow-smocked guards appeared in the\nhallway. “Escort Mr. Styke outside the premises, if you will. Mr. Styke, I’ll\nattend to a few items and then meet you outside. Try not to get into any\nfights on the way out.”\nThe process was over as fast as a whirlwind. Styke was led through the\nholding cells, marched through the labor camp, and straight toward the front\ngates. He walked mechanically, in a stupor, unable to believe that this was\nreally happening. Every step he expected this to be some kind of joke, a\ncruel attack on his psyche – a fleeting taste of freedom that would be pulled\naway at the last minute.\n“Ben!” a voice called, pulling him out of his stupor.

He turned to see\nCeline matching his pace, staying well out of reach of the guards. “Ben,”\nshe said, “they said you got in a fight. I thought you were a goner.”\nStyke felt a knot in the back of his throat. “Wait,” he told the guards,\nstopping and turning toward Celine. He was yanked forward.\n“No waiting,” one of them said. “You leave now or you don’t leave at\nall.”\n“Her,” he said, pointing at Celine. “She comes with me.” He let himself\nbe pulled along, unable to stop his feet from walking him toward freedom.\n“The girl wasn’t part of the deal,” the guard said.\n“She’s not a convict,” Styke said, hearing a note of desperation reach\nhis voice. “Her father was a convict. He died last season. She doesn’t have\nto stay here, she’s just stuck because she came along with him. Check the\nrecords, just let her out.”\n“Not happening,” the guard said. Styke was shoved roughly through the\nfront gate of the labor camp, the gate shut behind him while the guards\nchased Celine away from the entrance. She stopped a safe distance back,\nstaring openmouthed at Styke, a look of despair on her face. She was a\nchild, but she was far from stupid. She knew what this meant – the fate his\npresence protected her from.\n“Come on,” Styke said. “I’m not a begging man, but please. Just let the\ngirl go.”\nThe guard checked the lock on the gate, then sneered at Styke. “You\nbroke my cousin’s leg earlier today. He won’t work for months. Your kid\nback there” – he jerked his thumb toward Celine – “won’t last the week.”\nStyke snatched at the guard through the bars, but the man skipped back\nwith a laugh.\n“You’re nothing but a killer,” the guard said. “You’ll be back here in a\nfew months, once that posh asshole is finished with you. And we’ll have a\nwelcoming committee waiting.”\nStyke smacked his fist against the bars of the gate and retreated a safe\ndistance to pace, eyeing the guard towers above the palisade and the\nmuskets they held at the ready. He would tear the whole bloody camp down\nto get to Celine.\nTampo returned and was allowed through the gate. He held up a piece of\npaper that Styke recognized as the note Raimy received from the Lady\nChancellor’s office. “Is this the note you referenced?” he asked.\n“It is,” Styke said.\nTampo produced a match, lighting the edge of the paper, and letting it\nburn down to his fingertips before brushing away the ash. “There,” he said.\n“As far as anyone inside is concerned, no communication was received\nfrom the Lady Chancellor’s office and you were released as a free man\nwithout parole based on your exemplary record.” He dusted his suit jacket\noff and checked the polish on his shoes, looking pleased with himself,\nbefore gesturing toward a waiting carriage. “Shall we?”\nStyke shook his head."

The girl had disappeared, probably hiding\nfrom the guards.\n“Eh?”\n“Celine,” Styke said. “I’m not leaving without her. There.” He caught\nsight of her near one of the administration buildings, peeking out from\nbehind the corner. He’d always liked her independence – she could beat up\nany of the camp boys her age, and could outrun even the most determined\nconvict – but she suddenly looked vulnerable and alone. He would not leave\nher in the camp. “She comes with me.”\nHe waited for Tampo to say no. He could see the word on the lawyer’s\nlips as he looked back and forth between the two. Then Tampo suddenly\ncalled for a guard to open the gate. A handful of coins changed hands, and a\nfew minutes later Styke was riding in the carriage opposite of Tampo, an\narm around Celine, the girl clinging to his side. His aches and bruises\nseemed far away, and even his knee didn’t hurt as much as usual.\nHe looked down at Celine. She was clutching the canoe he’d carved her\nin one hand, the other grasping his. He glanced across at the lawyer, silently\ndaring him to say something about his relationship with the girl. All of the\nconvicts and guards certainly had.\n“The two of you reek,” was Tampo’s only comment.\n“So,” Styke said. “Who do you want me to kill?”\n“Have you ever heard of Lady Vlora Flint?” Tampo asked.\nStyke recalled a newspaper article he read awhile back about the Adran-\nKez War. “She’s a general in the Adran Army, isn’t she?”\n“That’s her,” Tampo said. “But she’s not with the Adran Army anymore.\nShe left Adro a few years ago when the government decided to reduce the\nsize of the military. Took the cream of the Adran Army with her and formed\nthe Riflejacks, a mercenary rifle company about five thousand men strong.”\nTampo looked out the window while he spoke. “She’s recently been\nrecalled here to Landfall to deal with the Palo riots. She arrives this\nafternoon. I want you to go join her company.”\n“What makes you think she would let me join?”\n“She will when she finds out who you are. No general worth their salt\nwould let Mad Ben Styke walk away. Besides, they had some losses putting\ndown Palo revolts on the frontier and they’ll want to come up to full\nstrength.”\n“And if she lets me in?” Styke asked.\n“Get close to her.”\n“You want me to kill her?” Styke was already working the idea through\nhis head. Lady Flint was a powder mage, and Styke had never fought a\npowder mage before. He wasn’t sure if he could manage one in a fair fight.\nFair seldom came into play during an assassination, though.\nTampo grinned at Styke, but the smile never touched his eyes. “On the\ncontrary,” he said. “I want you to keep her alive.

For now.”\nStyke thought he detected a sinister note to those last two words, but he\nshrugged it off. No more bars, no more hard labor. He didn’t even have to\nreport for parole. He laid his big, mangled hand on the back of Celine’s\nhead, gently patting her dirty hair. For the gift of his freedom – and Celine’s\n– he’d kill any damned person Tampo asked.\nCHAPTER 6\nM\nichel waited by the docks of Lower Landfall, watching a procession of\nkeelboats emerge from the Hadshaw Gorge and drift lazily toward their\nlanding site near the market. The keelboats were flat, low-in-the-water\ncrafts with peeling paint and a line of freestanding rowers on either side of\ntheir long, cigarlike frames. The decks of each boat were awash with dark\nred and blue – the uniforms of the mercenaries being transported on board.\nFatrasta had a long history of getting into bed with mercenary\ncompanies, from Brudanian soldiers carving land away from the Palo in the\nearly decades of colonization, to the more recent Wings of Adom helping\nthe Fatrastan Revolution against the Kez. The Lady Chancellor employed\ndozens of mercenary companies across the continent, in addition to\nFatrasta’s own military. Personally, Michel didn’t trust anyone whose\nloyalty could be bought with a stack of krana notes.\n“I’m not thrilled with this,” he muttered to himself.\nHe rolled his eyes at the inevitable answer. “You’re not thrilled with\nmuch of anything these days. Lady Flint has a great reputation. You should\nbe happy they didn’t assign you to some asshole.”\n“She might still be an asshole. Fidelis Jes said she was an arrogant\nbitch.”\n“Fidelis Jes is…” Michel paused, lest anyone nearby overhear his one-\nperson dialogue. “… doesn’t seem to have a great opinion of most people.\nRemember, this is just a light assignment. Take care of this and you can find\nthose Iron Roses.”\nThe keelboats drifted closer, their rowers occasionally dipping into the\nwater to control their heading in the gentle flow of the river. The first\nkeelboat finally pulled up next to the landing and a keelboater leapt onto the\nbank, securing the craft to land and running out the gangplank.\nSoldiers almost immediately began to disembark, lifting their packs and\nrifles and coming onto the shore, stopping for a stretch, forming orderly\ngroups in what Michel could only imagine were their companies. He stood\nwith his hands behind his back, black cap pushed forward to shield his eyes\nfrom the glare of the afternoon sun, and remained, for better or worse,\nmostly ignored by the arriving mercenaries. He wore his formal uniform,\nwith the black shirt with offset buttons, and silently cursed the man who\ndecided that the Blackhats absolutely had to dress in black.\nHe eyed the first boat, then the second, and, with growing annoyance,\nthe third.

Dozens of them would be arriving throughout the rest of the day –\nthe number it took to transport the whole brigade of mercenaries from the\nTristan Basin – and he had no interest in waiting that long out in the heat.\nMichel’s waning patience was rewarded as the fourth boat pulled up to\nthe landing. He recognized the first person to walk down the gangplank\nfrom the description in the dossier the Blackhats kept on her.\nEverything about Lady Vlora Flint seemed to contradict her name. She\nwas a short, slight woman of about thirty years of age with black hair tied\nback beneath her bicorn hat. She had a pretty face, worn by a decade of\ncampaigning in the sun but looking little older for it, and blue, calculating\neyes. Her uniform fit her like a second skin, sharply pressed despite several\ndays on the keelboats. One hand rested comfortably on the grip of a pistol\nin her belt, while the other had a thumb hooked in her belt.\nSomeone less informed than Michel might laugh at such an unassuming\nwoman at the head of a company of mercenaries. And they would be in for\nquite a nasty surprise.\nMichel mentally considered Flint’s Blackhat dossier, noting how little\ninformation it contained beyond the public record. Her life, after all, was\nalmost entirely in the public eye – from her broken engagement to Adran\nand Fatrastan war hero Taniel Two-shot shortly before his death in the\nAdran-Kez conflict, to her exit from the Adran political arena just four\nyears ago. As a powder mage, and the adopted daughter of Field Marshal\nTamas, she was about the most dyed-in-the-wool soldier one was likely to\nfind anywhere in the world.\nMichel cleared his throat. “Good afternoon, General Flint.”\nFlint paused a few feet off the gangplank, twisting at the waist to elicit a\nseries of loud pops from her spine and letting out a satisfied sigh. She eyed\nhis black cap. “Good afternoon. Do I know you?”\nHe showed her his Silver Rose before tucking it back into his shirt.\n“Michel Bravis, of her Lady Chancellor’s secret police.”\nFlint shook his hand, squeezing it just hard enough to let him know she\nwas in charge of the conversation but not so much as to overcompensate.\nHe wondered if she practiced her handshake. “A Blackhat, eh? To what do I\nowe the pleasure?”\n“Not much of a pleasure, I’m afraid,” Michel said, giving her his best\nsympathetic smile. “I’ve come from the Lady Chancellor’s office. I’ll be\nyour government liaison while your company is stationed here in the city.”\n“I see,” Flint said. “Here to keep an eye on me, are you?”\n“That’s the short of it,” Michel said. “The long of it is that I’ll give you\nyour assignments, make sure you’re paid, see to the comfort of your men,\nand offer you the assistance of the secret police when you’re in need of it.”\nFlint raised one eyebrow. “That’s… refreshingly honest.”\n“I try to keep these things painless,” Michel said.\n“Field Marshal Tamas always said a smiling spy was no different than a\nrug salesman,” Flint said, sniffing. “But you don’t smell like cheap pomade"

She was\nknown as a hard one – hence the moniker of “Flint.” But her sense of\nhumor surprised him, which among high-ranking military types was about\nas common as a flying horse. She certainly didn’t seem arrogant. He’d have\nto keep a close eye on her.\n“Landfall smells like hot shit and sweat,” Michel said. “Wearing\ncologne does very little to help. And I buy very expensive pomade, thank\nyou. As much as I’d love to exchange witticisms with you all afternoon, I’m\nafraid I am here on government business.”\nFlint pointed to a young man dragging a trunk off the keelboat. “Just\nleave it over there, Dobri. Thank you.” Her attention returned to Michel.\n“Of course. I was a little surprised at being urgently recalled, let alone being\nsent keelboats for my infantry. As far as I can tell the city hasn’t been\nburned to the ground, so what’s the hurry?”\n“We’re understaffed,” Michel said, recalling the information he’d read\nin the file on Lady Flint’s new assignment. “There have been several Palo\nriots in the last couple of months that our garrison is woefully unprepared to\ndeal with, and the number of immigrants coming into the city means the\nBlackhats and the regular police are terribly overtaxed.”\n“You just need manpower?” Lady Flint asked, seemingly taken aback.\n“And it couldn’t have waited a few weeks for us to finish our work in the\nBasin?”\nSomeone, somewhere, had decided they wanted Lady Flint back in the\ncity quickly. Michel wasn’t about to question his superiors. “They decided\nthat your presence here was more important.”\nA figure coming off the keelboat caught the corner of Michel’s eye. He\ndidn’t recognize the face, but the man’s bearing, the silver star on his lapel,\nand the familiar way with which he fell in beside Lady Flint told Michel\nthat this was Colonel Olem. Another Adran war hero and, if rumors were to\nbe believed, Lady Flint’s longtime lover. Olem lit a cigarette, and breathed a\nlong trail of smoke out his nostrils while he looked Michel up and down.\nFlint didn’t acknowledge Olem’s arrival. “So what do you have for\nme?”\n“An arrest.” Michel handed over the file he’d been given that morning.\nOlem choked on the smoke from his cigarette. “You brought our entire\narmy down here to arrest someone?” He took the file from Lady Flint’s\nhands and flipped it open, reading furiously.\nMichel turned away, looking at the soldiers unloading the keelboats,\nconsidering his words carefully. He was simply here to pass on orders. That\ndidn’t mean he had to like the orders. “The Palo used to be a disorganized\ncollection of tribes and city-states scattered across Fatrasta.

They fought\namong themselves more than they fought the Kressians, and were never\nmore than a minor threat to Fatrastan colonies.”\n“That still seems to be the case on the frontier,” Flint said.\n“Not in Landfall. They’ve become organized; focused. Freedom fighters\nlike the Red Hand send their agents here to stir up trouble. They strike and\nhold protests. Their riots are planned. The Palo in Landfall are in open\nsedition against the Lady Chancellor’s government.”\n“I don’t like where this is going,” Flint said.\nMichel held up a hand. “We’re not asking you to slaughter anyone in the\nstreets. The Lady Chancellor has no interest in making war against her own\npeople. We just need you to arrest their local leader.”\n“A single person?” Flint asked flatly. “I would think such an act would\nbe within the power of the Blackhats.”\nMichel met her eyes. “I wish it was that simple. No one knows where\nshe is or what she looks like. Mama Palo is a ghost. Every attempt at\narresting her has ended up either a dead end or a fiasco. All we know about\nher is that she’s an old woman and that she’s united the local Palo beneath\nher.”\n“You want us to bring in someone’s grandmother so you can hang her?”\n“Cut off the head of the snake,” Michel said. “Once Mama Palo is dead,\nthe Palo will go back to fighting each other and the Blackhats can bring\nstability to the city.” At least, he added to himself silently, that’s the theory.\nFlint chewed on this for several moments, clearly uncomfortable with\nthe idea. She exchanged a long glance with Olem, some silent\ncommunication passing between them.\n“There’s a reason you called us back with a whole brigade,” Olem said.\n“Yes,” Michel admitted. “Do you know anything about Greenfire\nDepths?”\n“Not really,” Flint said.\n“It’s a pit. An immense, ancient quarry on the western side of the\nplateau. It’s almost a mile across, stuffed with old tenements, filled to the\nbrim with Palo. Palo homes, businesses, churches. No intelligent Kressian\nenters Greenfire Depths after dark, and Blackhats will only go there in\nforce. Mama Palo is hiding somewhere in that rat’s nest and it’ll take an\narmy to find her and bring her out.” It did seem odd to him that Fidelis Jes\nwould bring so many soldiers into the city to arrest one person. But the\nsituation with the Palo had gotten bad and besides, it almost seemed like Jes\nwas hoping Lady Flint would start slaughtering people in the streets. Not\nthat Michel was going to tell her that.\n“It sounds,” Flint said, “like you’re asking me to invade your own city.”\n“The Lady Chancellor leaves the details to you,” Michel said, giving\nFlint a tight smile. He didn’t like the whole idea, but he was certainly glad it\nwasn’t his job. “She gives you full authority to operate within the Depths –\nshort of burning the whole thing down, of course.”\n“That is, unfortunately, the best way to find a needle in a haystack,”"

We can provide logistical support\nfor your men – food, lodging, ammunition, et cetera. We’re also willing to\npay you for an entire year’s contract.”\n“That sounds fair,” Olem commented.\nHis input seemed enough for Flint. “All right,” she said. “How long do\nwe have?”\n“A month. But the Lady Chancellor would be very pleased if you found\nMama Palo before that.”\n“I’ll need every scrap of information you have on the Depths,” Flint\nsaid. “Maps, information on factions, businesses. Everything you can give\nme.”\n“It’ll be done,” Michel said. “We have a few agents within the Depths.\nI’ll make introductions.” He produced a small square of stationery from his\npocket, handing it to Flint. “Here’s my card if you need to find me. I’ll\ncheck in as frequently as I can. Is there anything else I can do for you?”\nFlint ran her fingers over the embossed edge of the card, frowning. “I\ndid have one question. Have you ever heard of a Palo wearing the skin of a\nswamp dragon and carrying bone axes?”\n“No,” Michel said after a moment’s consideration. It sounded familiar –\na story he’d been told as a child, perhaps – but nothing sprang immediately\nto mind. “I don’t think I’ve heard of that before. Any reason you ask?”\n“We ran into one of them putting down the uprising at Fort Samnan.\nFought like a madman, killed or wounded nearly forty of my men. I’ve\nnever seen anything like it short of a powder mage or a Privileged.”\nMichel shrugged. It sounded like nonsense. Stories from the frontier\nwere frequently embellished, even by otherwise levelheaded people. He\npreferred to let them slide without any real scrutiny. Even if they were true,\nhis territory was Landfall and its citizens – not whatever god-awful things\nwere lurking out there in the swamps. “I should get back to work,” he said,\ngesturing at the business card in her hand. “Call on me if there’s anything\nyou need.”\nHe made his good-byes and drifted through the disembarking soldiers,\nthen across the marketplace as he forced his mind to shift from one task to\nanother, Flint and her men already put out of his mind by the time he\nreached the main thoroughfare.\nLady Flint would be, he decided, left to her own devices. Finding the\nIron Roses, and doing so in a sufficiently short time so as to please Fidelis\nJes, was going to take all his effort. And he might have to piss a few people\noff to do so.\nVlora watched the Blackhat retreat toward the market street before turning\nto Olem.\n“What did you think of that?” she asked.\nOlem puffed thoughtfully on his cigarette, reading the newspaper\nclipping that Michel had handed Vlora. “Not a bad fellow. For a spy.”\nVlora frowned after Michel. “Seemed more like a bureaucrat to me."

For a spy.”\nVlora frowned after Michel. “Seemed more like a bureaucrat to me.\nThey wouldn’t waste a real spy on us, would they?”\n“Definitely a spy,” Olem said. “You notice his face? Plain, clean-\nshaven, ordinary? Think you could describe him to me right now, even\nthough he just walked away?”\n“No,” Vlora said after a moment’s consideration. “I couldn’t.”\n“Nobody with such a forgettable face works for the Blackhats as a\nregular old pencil-pusher,” Olem said. “And the Silver Rose? That’s middle\nmanagement. Someone his age only gets a Silver Rose if he’s distinguished\nhimself.”\n“I didn’t know Blackhats have ranks,” Vlora said.\n“Iron, Bronze, Brass, Silver, and Gold. But from what I understand their\nranking system is skewed. The power belongs to the Gold Roses, and then\nthere’s everyone else. It’s not that dissimilar from the Riflejacks,” he added\nwith a grin. “Lady Flint is in charge, then the rest of us poor sods.”\nVlora took Olem’s cigarette from him, taking a long drag and blowing\nthe smoke toward the open sea. She got her first chance to really look\naround at their location. They stood on the slice of land between Landfall\nPlateau and the bay. Behind them the Hadshaw River wound through a\ngorge that split the Landfall Plateau in two. Before them, the river fed into a\nwide, tranquil bay protected from the ocean by a mixture of natural and\nman-made breakers. The smell of salt rode heavily on the air and gulls cried\noverhead.\nFarther along the inlet from the keelboat landing was the proper dock,\nout in deep water with immense sailing ships at moor. Directly across from\nit was Fort Nied, an old fortress pitted and scarred by the Fatrastan\nRevolution.\n“Find out more about him,” Vlora said. “And dig up as much\ninformation as you can about Greenfire Depths and this Mama Palo. We can\nonly trust the Blackhats as far as their own interests, which might include\ncensoring whatever information they give us. I want the real story.”\n“On it,” Olem said.\n“Where are our cavalry?” she asked.\n“I haven’t heard anything from Major Gustar, but I doubt Landfall has\nthe stables to house a thousand horses at the spur of the moment. I’ll send\nword to them to camp north of the city, and we’ll send them supplies.\nThey’ll be nearby.”\nVlora wanted all her men here, but she’d have to make do with the\ninfantry. She was suddenly nervous, the corner of her eye twitching like it\ndid when an uncertain battle lay before her. “I don’t want any surprises.”\nShe pressed a palm to her eye. “Also look into getting us a few hundred\nmen to replace the losses we took in the Tristan Basin. I’d prefer Adrans.”\n“Will do.”\n“Thank you.” She let a concerned look cross her face, feeling\nvulnerable, and turned toward Olem. “Tell me I haven’t just put us on a\npowder keg and lit the fuse.”"

Styke remained hunched over, the brim of\nhis hat pulled down to obscure his face, until long after the Blackhat\ndisappeared into the crowd, before turning back and watching the Adran\nmercenaries unload their cargo off the keelboats.\nJust an hour ago he’d managed to find an old newspaper article about\nthe Riflejacks that gave him more information than Tampo’s brief. The\nRiflejacks started off as Field Marshal Tamas’s personal bodyguard during\nthe Adran-Kez War, turning into a full brigade of picked men by the end of\nthe conflict. When the Adran government decided to reduce the size of the\narmy, General Flint offered them all a job working as mercenaries and they\nfollowed her out of the country, almost to a man.\nStyke searched the faces of the Riflejacks, examining their body\nlanguage, studying their uniforms and weapons, and found himself\nimpressed. These were killers. Real soldiers. The men who spat in the Kez\nking’s face and threw the Grand Army out of Adro ten years ago.\nAnd Styke had to figure out a way to join them.\nHe remembered working with real soldiers. The feel of lances at his\nback, the smell of powder from a coordinated carbine volley, and then the\nrush as he dug his heels into Deshner’s sides and three hundred armored\ncavalry slammed into an enemy flank. The enemy broke – they always\nbroke – and the Mad Lancers had ridden their officers down like dogs.\nHe made a mental note of the two that the Blackhat had been speaking\nwith and guessed they were General Flint and Colonel Olem. Even at this\ndistance his nose twitched. Styke had a Knack – a minor sorcery – that\nallowed him to smell magic. It didn’t help him one ounce in the work camp\nbecause anyone with useful sorcery tended to avoid being sent to the camps.\nThe reek of sulfur about her told him she was a powder mage as clear as the\nsmell of shit helped him find the outhouse.\nOlem had a smell to him, too, though it was less pronounced. He\nsmelled like rich, freshly turned soil. He, like Styke, also had a Knack.\nStyke would have to find out what it was.\n“Hey,” a voice said, “you just going to stand there blocking up my stall\nor you going to buy anything?”\nStyke turned to find a red-faced man with a long beard and an apron\nlooking up at him from behind one of the market tables.

The sign over the\nstall said OPENHIEM’S APOTHECARY.\n“Celine,” Styke said absently, glancing over his shoulder. He found the\ngirl two stalls down, eyeing a bin of apples, pacing back and forth in front\nof the fruit seller. She was wearing a new outfit: trousers and a shirt and hat.\nAn old woman at the local bathhouse had scraped the grime from her face\nand arms. She almost looked like a real child now, and not that feral thing\nhe’d adopted in the camp.\nThe fruit seller was watching her, too. He made a shooing motion with\none hand, clearly expecting her to steal something. In response, Celine took\na few steps closer to the apples, stuck her tongue out, and plucked a cloth\ndoll off the table of the next vendor over. The fruit vendor seemed so\nsurprised at the change in direction that Celine had already faded into the\nafternoon crowd before he could open his mouth.\n“Hey, big man. You hear me?”\nStyke’s attention returned to the apothecary in front of him. He eyed the\nroots, then pointed at one of them. “Is that horngum?”\n“It is,” the apothecary said. His tone shifted from annoyed vendor to\nsalesman in an instant as he looked over Styke’s facial scars and obvious\nlimp. “The best thing out there for pains and aches of all kind.”\n“Is it fresh?”\n“Of course it’s fresh!” the apothecary said indignantly.\nLike Celine, Styke had cleaned himself up. His beard was gone, his hair\ncut, body washed and massaged. A new set of clothes clung tightly to his\nframe, the biggest the tailor had ready-made, and three more sets had been\nmeasured and marked out for him to retrieve later in the week. He felt like a\nnew man – and at the same time vulnerable; a naked cur, ready to be called\nout by the city police at any moment and rushed back to the work camps.\nHe dug into his pocket for the roll of krana bills Tampo had given him.\nA few moments of haggling, and the apothecary handed him the entire root.\n“Now then, you’ll want to boil down a small portion into a tea…” the\napothecary began.\nStyke took a thumb-sized bite and began to chew. The horngum tasted\nsour, like a dozen lemons jammed into his mouth all at once. He felt his\ncheek twitch and the right side of his jaw went completely numb. Slowly,\nhis body began to have a pleasant tingle and he found that when he told his\nleg to move it obeyed him almost immediately. The apothecary looked on in\nhorror.\n“Yup,” Styke said. “Definitely fresh.”\nHe found Celine back around the side of the next stall over, eyeing a\nbrand-new dress laid out by a seamstress. Styke took her by the arm, noting\nthe pilfered doll in her pocket, and pulled her away from the seamstress’s\nstall. “You can steal,” he said quietly, “but if they catch you they’ll put you"

And I won’t ask Tampo to go in for you.”\nCeline lifted her chin. “I don’t get caught. My dad was the best thief in\nLandfall.”\n“And how did that work out for him?”\nCeline cast him a sullen, sidelong glance. “He got sucked into the\nswamp at the work camp.”\n“Right. Remember that,” Styke said. He put his hat on her, then grabbed\nher by the back of the shirt with his good hand and lifted her onto his\nshoulder, letting her settle in comfortably before he continued. He\nwondered briefly how they looked – a little girl in boy’s clothing, balanced\non the shoulder of a giant, her skinny arm wrapped around his scarred head.\n“You remember this city?” he asked.\n“Yes,” Celine said matter-of-factly. “Dad was only in the camps for six\nmonths before he drowned. We used to go all over the boroughs, so I know\neach of them pretty well.”\n“Good. It’s been a long time since I was here last. The city feels\ndifferent… like an old saddle I sold long ago and have only now bought\nback. The market” – he gestured around him – “it’s all the same.” He\npointed to the slanting, eastern face of the plateau. “That road there is new;\nso is that one. The main road over to the foundries has been widened.\nEverything is… wrong.”\n“My dad used to say it was progress. The Lady Chancellor ripping up\nthe old buildings and putting in new ones, whole blocks at a time.”\n“Don’t say that word.”\n“What word?”\n“Progress. Say ‘shit,’ ‘damn,’ or ‘pit’ all you want, but ‘progress’ is a\ncurse around me. Such a stupid bloody word.” Styke shook his head, feeling\nCeline tighten her grip momentarily. “Lindet’s trying to rebuild the city in\nher image, but it’s all on the surface – the front half. She put any new\ntenements up in Greenfire Depths?”\n“No,” Celine said.\n“Didn’t think so.” Styke pictured the map of the city he kept in his head.\nLandfall had started as a fort atop the cracked Landfall Plateau – an oblong\nchunk of rock that rose almost two hundred feet above the floodplains of\nFatrasta’s eastern coast. During the Kez reign, the town had overfilled the\nplateau and spread across the plains from Novi’s Arm in the south to the\nlabor camps in the marshes to the north. The “front half,” as he liked to call\nit, included the bay, docks, industrial center, and the bourgeoisie tenements\nand government buildings up on the plateau. The “back half” consisted of\nseveral miles of slums, stretching toward the west, and including the old\nDynize quarry known as Greenfire Depths.\nNobody cared about Greenfire Depths back during the war, and nobody\ncared about it now.

Some things never changed.\nStyke caught sight of a small building in the corner of the marketplace.\nSmoke belched from several stacks on the roof and a sign read FLES AND\nFLES FINE BLADES.\n“You remember what you used to do in the camp?” Styke asked Celine.\n“Keep an eye out?”\n“Yeah. You’re going to have to do that from now on, except this time\nit’s going to be harder. We’re not in the camp anymore, and not everyone is\nan enemy.”\n“Shouldn’t that make it easier?”\n“You’d think, but out here you don’t know who your friends or enemies\nare. Every person you see has the potential to be either one, and you’ll have\nto judge for yourself which they are.”\n“Dad always said never to trust anyone.”\n“Gotta trust some people some of the time. Otherwise what’s the use of\nliving?”\n“So how will I know if someone is my friend?” Celine asked.\nStyke lifted her off his shoulder as they drew closer to the sword\nvendor, setting her on the ground beside him. “For now, I’ll let you know.\nBut this is a big world. I won’t be able to tell you all the time. You’ll have\nto trust your instincts.”\n“I can do it,” Celine said, lifting her chin proudly.\nStyke patted her on the back of the head. “I know. Come on, we’re\ngoing in here. I’ve got to see someone.”\n“Are they a friend or an enemy?” Celine asked.\nStyke paused, considering this for a moment. “A friend. I hope.”\nThe blade vendor had a long, narrow stall facing the market street,\nbehind which several red-faced youths stood wearing smith’s aprons,\nhawking swords and knives of all kinds to the passing crowd. Styke sidled\nup to the table and looked over it, eyeing the quality of the knives, looking\nfor something that could fit his size. Nothing stood out to him. “Since when\ndoes Fles and Fles take on apprentices?” he asked.\nTwo of the boys behind the table glanced at each other. “Seven, maybe\neight years now,” the older one said.\nAnd some things, Styke told himself silently, change a lot. “I’m looking\nfor Ibana ja Fles.”\n“Ibana isn’t here,” the older boy said. “She went to Redstone a few\nweeks ago for an ore shipment.”\nStyke let out something between an annoyed groan and a sigh of relief.\nHe wasn’t entirely sure himself which it was. “How about the Old Man? He\nstill kicking around here?”\n“Mr. Fles is in the back.”\n“Right.” Styke walked around the table and ducked into the building\nbehind it, ignoring the protests of the apprentices. Celine followed on his\nheels.\nThe inside of the foundry was well lit by large windows and\nstrategically placed gaps in the roof. Four bellows worked at once, feeding\nfour fires, each of them attended by a trio of apprentices. The clang of\nhammers on steel was deafening as he passed through the center of the\nfoundry and approached a curtain near the back. He pulled it aside to reveal\na small workbench."

    "text": "hammers on steel was deafening as he passed through the center of the\nfoundry and approached a curtain near the back. He pulled it aside to reveal\na small workbench.\nAn old man, less than five feet tall with sagging cheeks and arms folded\nacross his chest, sat rocking back in his chair, feet on the workbench, long\nmustache trembling as he snored loudly enough to compete with the\nhammers. Styke watched him for a moment, feeling an involuntary smile\ntug at the corner of his mouth.\nThere was a time he thought he’d never see Old Man Fles again.\nStyke held his finger up to his lips, motioning to Celine to come inside\nthe curtained-off workshop and close the curtain, then held his hands right\nnext to the Old Man’s left ear. He clapped them together as hard as he\ncould, hard enough to make his crippled hand throb painfully.\nOld Man Fles leapt halfway out of his chair, arms windmilling, and\nwould have gone over backward had Styke not caught him.\n“By Kresimir,” Fles swore, “who the… what the… why are you back\nhere? Can’t you see important work is being done? I will summon my… I\nwill summon… my…” Fles regained his composure slowly, his eyes\nfocusing on Styke. He searched his apron pockets for a pair of spectacles\nand perched them on the bridge of his nose. “Benjamin?” he asked\nincredulously. “Benjamin Styke?”\n“That’s right,” Styke said.\nFles blinked at him for several moments. His mouth opened, then\nclosed, and slowly the surprised expression slid off his face, replaced by\nannoyance – like he was staring at a barely tolerated dog he thought had run\noff for good. “I thought you were dead.”\n“They tried,” Styke said. “Twice.”\n“By Kresimir,” Fles breathed. “Where have you been?”\n“Work camps.”\n“Last we heard you’d been put up against the wall. You never wrote.\nIbana is going to kill you.” The three sentences came out in a quick tumble\nof words.\n“I was. And they wouldn’t let me.”\n“Won’t matter to her, you know.”\nStyke sighed. “I know.”\nFles’s eyes went to Celine. “Who’s this?”\n“My associate, Celine. Celine, this is Old Man Fles. He’s the best\nswordmaker in Fatrasta.”\n“Don’t short me, boy,” Fles said. “I’m the best in the world.”\nCeline seemed more than a little skeptical. “You’re a blacksmith?” she\nasked.\n“A blacksmith?” Fles huffed. “Do I look like I make horseshoes and\ntrinkets? I deal death here, little lady. The finest death in all the lands. Here,\ntake a look at this.” Fles reached across his workbench, plucking a sword\noff the wall. It was a smallsword, simple and elegant, with a silver guard\nand gold rivets on the pommel. He held it beneath Celine’s nose. “This is\nmy latest. Took me eight months.”\n“It doesn’t look very fancy,” Celine said.\n“Fancy has nothing to do with a good sword,” Fles countered. “Doesn’t"

Took me eight months.”\n“It doesn’t look very fancy,” Celine said.\n“Fancy has nothing to do with a good sword,” Fles countered. “Doesn’t\nmatter if you’re a child or seven feet tall – the balance on this sword is\nperfect. It weighs next to nothing, without sacrificing momentum. There’s\nmagic in this blade.”\n“It’s also worth a prince’s ransom,” Styke said. “Three kings of the Nine\nall carry Fles blades.”\n“Two,” Fles countered. “Field Marshal Tamas put Manhouch’s head in a\nbasket, in case you hadn’t heard.”\n“Ten years ago,” Styke said. “I did get the occasional newspaper.”\n“Just two kings now,” Fles repeated with a sigh, putting the sword back\non its peg.\nStyke stared at the weapon for a few moments, barely hearing the clang\nof the hammers on anvils out in the foundry. He’d spent many years in this\nlittle workshop and his brain seemed to instinctively tune the hammers out.\nThere were a lot of memories here, both good and bad. He steeled himself,\nforcing them all to the back of his head.\n“So, you’re out of the work camps and still alive? What are you doing\nhere, then? Ibana’s gone to Redstone, if you’re looking for her.”\n“I need a blade,” Styke said. “Something cheaper than that.”\n“As if I’d give you one of mine,” Fles scoffed. “It’d be like a toothpick\nto you.” He sucked on his front teeth for a moment, tapping the side of his\nhead. “Ah, I seem to remember something…” He bent beneath the\nworkbench, rummaging through several boxes before removing a long\nbundle. He withdrew the wrappings, tossing them on the workbench, and\nproudly held a knife out to Styke. “No idea why she kept it,” he said. “It’s\nfar from her best work.”\nIt was called a “boz” knife, after the inventor, but most people would\nfind the “knife” part an understatement. It had a fixed blade and was thirty-\ntwo inches from the slightly hooked, double-bladed tip to the end of the\nworn, ironwood handle. It had a steel crosspiece, with a dried bit of\nsomething – probably a Kez officer’s blood – still caught in the joint.\nCarved into the bottom of the handle was a craftsman’s mark with the name\n“Fles.” Styke removed the blade from its old leather sheath, examined it for\nrust or misuse – it was freshly sharpened and oiled – and kissed the\ncraftsman’s mark before fastening the sheath to his belt.\nHe swallowed a lump in his throat. It wasn’t just an enormous knife, big\neven for the boz style. It was his knife.\nStyke let Fles’s complaint go by without comment and turned his\nattentions to the wrappings the knife had been stored in. On closer\nexamination, it was a faded yellow cavalryman’s jacket, with a colonel’s\nstar still pinned to one lapel. One of the pockets was heavy, and he turned\nout a silver necklace with a big, heavy ring hanging from the end – on the\nface of the ring was a skull the size of his thumb, run through with a lance,"

The sigil of the Mad Lancers. Styke licked\nhis lips, feeling a moment of reverence as he unhooked the chain and slid\nthe ring over his right ring finger. Without a word, he folded his jacket and\nput it under his arm.\n“Take it,” Fles said. “Gets some of the junk out of my workshop. Ibana\nis going to throw a shit fit when she finds it missing.” He grinned wickedly,\nthen let the smile slide off his face.\n“Thanks,” Styke said.\n“She’s going to kill you,” Fles reiterated.\nStyke ignored the warning. “You still have your ear to the ground?” he\nasked.\n“What do you mean?”\n“Information.”\n“Bah,” Fles said. “I haven’t traded information since the war.” He eyed\nStyke for a few seconds, his gaze lingering on the scars. “But I’m not deaf.\nWhat are you looking for?”\nStyke considered his course of action, looking at the sword hanging on\nthe wall behind Fles. The next words out of his mouth could have serious\nconsequences. Bringing Old Man Fles into his vendetta could get him\nkilled, and Ibana really would kill him if he did that. But Styke needed help.\n“The Blackhats,” he said, “they still as powerful as they were during the\nwar?”\nFles snorted. “And then some, over and over again. They’re one of the\nreasons I got out of the information business. If you work in Landfall, you\nwork for the Blackhats, and I have no interest in them. During the war they\nwere just a bunch of thugs and spies, but now…” Fles trailed off. “You\ndon’t want to get involved with the Blackhats.”\n“They give you any trouble?” Styke asked.\n“I pay them off every few months with a box of castoffs. Gives their\nmidlevel bureaucrats something to brag about, having a Fles blade, without\nwatering down my image.”\nStyke couldn’t help but grin. Fles was getting old, but he was still as\nsharp as any of his swords. The grin slipped off his face as he came to his\nnext question. “And” – he took a breath – “Fidelis Jes?”\nFles looked like he’d bitten into a lemon. “Still runs the Blackhats. Still\nas cruel as ever. He’s in the gossip columns every couple of months for\nkilling someone important, and he seems to revel in it.”\n“Lindet lets him get away with open murder?” Styke was surprised by\nthat.\n“Not quite,” Fles said. “He leaves space in his schedule for at least one\nduel every morning. Anyone can challenge him, as long as they don’t use\nguns or sorcery. He’s hated enough that his schedule is full weeks in\nadvance, but he never loses.”\nStyke’s grip tightened on the butt of his knife. “You mean I could just\nwalk in there and challenge him to a fight to the death?” That sounded\nincredibly too easy.\n“You’d be a fool.” Fles snorted. “Never challenge someone in their own"

Besides, you look like you got run over by an army’s baggage\ntrain, while Jes is more dangerous than ever.” Fles waved a finger under\nStyke’s nose. “Don’t you give in to that temptation or I’ll tell Ibana, and she\nwill desecrate your corpse.”\n“I’m not a fool.” Styke said, though the prospect did tempt him. “I’d\nmuch rather enjoy the startled look on his face when he wakes up in the\ndead of night to my hands around his throat.”\n“Much better thinking,” Fles agreed. “But getting that chance will be\nnext to impossible. The Blackhats deal with any sort of threat with brutal\nefficiency. You should stay away from the Blackhats and stay away from\nFidelis Jes.”\nStyke considered his mission from Tampo. “I will for now,” he said.\n“But I can’t ignore them for good.”\n“I hope you’ve got a damned good reason.”\n“Jes tried to sabotage my parole hearing. I don’t know why, but if he\nknew I was in the labor camps then he might be the one who put me there in\nthe first place. And if he’s not, he’ll know who did. I owe him for that.\nAnd,” Styke said, gesturing with his mangled hand to the deep bullet scar\non his face, “for this.”\n“What do you need?” Fles asked quietly.\n“Everything about him. His habits, his friends. I want to know where he\nshits and where he eats. I want to know how tight Lindet has him on a\nleash.”\nFles’s face fell a little with every word Styke uttered. He stared at\nCeline for a few moments, then up at Styke. “I’ll see what I can do.”\n“Thanks,” Styke said.\n“Is he going to come looking for you?” Fles said.\n“I don’t know,” Styke replied. It wasn’t something that had occurred to\nhim, but the possibility made him swear inwardly. If Fidelis Jes wanted him\nkept in the camps, he’d be furious if he found out Styke was released.\n“Maybe.”\n“I’ll keep an ear to the ground,” Fles said, “but I’ll have to be damned\ncareful about it.”\nStyke looked around, the workshop feeling suddenly foreign to his eyes.\nIt had been too long. “I appreciate the help. When Ibana comes back…”\n“I’ll tell her to find you.”\n“Thanks again.” Styke took Celine by the hand and slipped out from\nbehind the curtain and toward the front of the foundry. He was deep in\nthought, barely noticing the apprentices who stared at him as he went by.\n“Ben!” Fles called out behind him.\nStyke half-turned to the old swordmaker. “Yeah?”\nFles hobbled out into the middle of the market and peered up at him,\nface thoughtful, and said in a low tone, “Good to see you again. Is Mad Ben\nStyke back to give ’em the pit?”\nStyke held his jacket out at arm’s length, examining it for a moment"

    "text": "Styke back to give ’em the pit?”\nStyke held his jacket out at arm’s length, examining it for a moment\nbefore removing the pins from the lapels. He stuffed them in his pants\npocket and slipped his arms into the jacket. It still fit him, even if it was a\nbit loose. He rolled his shoulders, feeling a knot that he’d not known he\nhad, disappear from his stomach. He clenched one fist, feeling the heavy\nlancer’s ring on his finger. “He is.”\nCHAPTER 8\nV\nlora sat in a wicker chair in the yard of Willem Marsh, one of Landfall’s\nmost popular outdoor coffeehouses. The sun had set but the Landfall\nboardwalk remained loud, well lit, and crowded. The docks creaked with\nthe movement of the sea while sailors fought over dice and prostitutes.\nVlora sipped her coffee and stared into the crowd, waiting for the inevitable\nknife fight to break out.\nPit, it was good to be back in a real city again.\nShe felt a hand briefly squeeze her shoulder, then Olem dropped into the\nchair beside her, his fingers rolling a new cigarette before he’d even settled.\n“Well?” she asked.\nOlem smiled at her from behind a sudden cloud of smoke. It was a cool,\neasy smile – one she hadn’t seen for months – and it made her heart skip a\nbeat. “I found us a room,” he said. “At the Angry Wart in Upper Landfall.\nRunning hot water, nightly pig roast, and a bed we could sleep head to foot\nacross the width.”\n“I intend to do very little sleeping.”\nOlem leaned toward her, wiggling his eyebrows. “I don’t intend on\nsleeping, either.”\nVlora rolled her eyes.\n“Because of my Knack,” Olem explained in mock earnestness. “I don’t\nneed sleep.”\n“I know!” Vlora took the cigarette from him and took a drag before\nhanding it back. She held the smoke in for a moment, then slowly exhaled it\nthrough her nostrils. “And you know exactly what I meant.”\nOlem smirked. Of course he knew what she meant, the prig. “The room\ncosts a small fortune, but I think it’ll be worth —”\nVlora punched him in the shoulder. “Report, soldier.”\n“Right,” Olem said, rubbing his shoulder. “Michel was as good as his\nword. He’s given us an old barracks on the edge of Greenfire Depths and\nsent over a few hundred boxes’ worth of files the Blackhats keep on\nGreenfire Depths and the Palo activity in the city. I’ve got my sharpest boys\nreading through it all, but it’ll take them days. Even then we won’t know\nhow much they held back.”\nVlora nodded, pleased at how quickly Olem had organized the effort –\nas well as the idea of a hot bath and a large bed. They needed alone time\nthat was hard to get in a mercenary camp in the middle of the swamp.\n“Have you gotten anything out of your contacts?”\n“It’ll take me weeks to set up any sort of intelligence network,” Olem\nsaid, puffing out his cheeks and slowly letting them deflate. “I can’t decide\nif the Blackhats will make it easier or harder.

Practically everyone in the\ncity sells information, but most of it goes directly to them.”\n“Do the best you can,” Vlora said, reaching over and squeezing Olem’s\nhand. “You ask anyone about Mama Palo?”\nOlem snorted. “Yeah, and everyone has a different answer. She’s either\nan enemy of the state, a freedom fighter, or a Palo god made flesh,\ndepending on who you ask.”\nVlora felt her skin crawl. “I’ve dealt with enough gods for one lifetime,\nthank you very much.” She thought briefly about the Adran-Kez War, an\ninvoluntary chill creeping down her spine. “My entire family died killing\nthe last one we encountered.”\n“Well,” Olem said, shifting uncomfortably in his seat. He had his own\nmemories from the war, his own ghosts – many of them the same as hers. “I\ndon’t think Mama Palo is a god. She’s clever, though. Stirs up huge\namounts of trouble without ever provoking an outright battle with the\nBlackhats. The Palo worship her, the Blackhats despise her, and the rest of\nFatrasta just hopes to stay out of the way when she and Lindet finally come\nto blows.”\nVlora forced a chuckle. “Is Lindet pissed someone is challenging her for\nqueen of Fatrasta?”\n“Wouldn’t you be?”\n“I’ve no interest in a queendom,” Vlora said, dismissing the thought\nwith a wave. “This Mama Palo… is she really that big of a threat?”\n“I won’t know for sure until I get my intelligence network set up.” Olem\nheld up a hand, signaling a passing waiter, and ordered coffee. He frowned\nat the dark night sky. “Nobody can challenge Lindet outright. It’s not a\nwinnable fight. But it looks like Mama Palo has no intention of fighting\nLindet – simply annoying her to the point of giving up.”\n“Giving up what, though?” Vlora asked. “What does Mama Palo want?”\n“Palo rights?” Olem speculated. “Palo independence? Land, money?\nWhat does anyone want?”\nVlora pointed at Olem’s chest. “Find out. It sounds like the Blackhats\nwant us to go through Greenfire Depths kicking down doors until we find\nher, but you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. If we can find out\nMama Palo’s goals we might be able to track her down.” She ticked through\nhalf-formed plans in her head, examining each one briefly before discarding\nit – or storing it away for further consideration later.\n“You see this guy watching us?” Olem asked, lifting his chin.\nVlora took Olem’s coffee from the waiter, handing it across, before\nfollowing Olem’s gaze. She spotted the man quickly. He stood on the other\nside of the café, just inside the small partition between the coffeehouse and\nthe boardwalk. He was big – no, enormous – with thick, broad shoulders\nand a bent back, his head held forward like a man used to hiding his height\nand still over six and a half feet tall. His left cheek had an old, pitted scar\nand his hair was gray, his jaw large and firm."

    "text": "and still over six and a half feet tall. His left cheek had an old, pitted scar\nand his hair was gray, his jaw large and firm.\nHe wore a shirt and trousers that were slightly too small for him, and an\nold Fatrastan cavalry jacket slightly too big. His only weapon was hooked\nto his belt – a boz knife longer than Vlora’s arm.\nHe stared openly at her and Olem, only pulling his gaze away to take a\ncoffee and newspaper from a waiter, before heading in their direction.\nVlora tensed, not sure what to expect. She was a powder mage, faster\nand stronger than any four people in this café, but everything about the\nman, from his scars and limp to the casual way people moved out of his\nway as he walked through the crowded café, spoke of imminent violence.\nShe found her heart beating a little faster.\nOlem shifted in his chair, spreading his legs so that his pistol could be\ndrawn easily. “I saw him down at the keelboat landing earlier today. I\nthought he was watching us, but I wasn’t sure until now.”\n“Adom,” Vlora breathed, “look at the size of that knife.” She brushed\nher hand across the hilt of her sword.\nThe man slowed as he approached them, looking around with a frown,\nbefore reaching over to an occupied table and gently removing the coffee\ncup and handing it to the startled owner. “Pardon me,” he said in a deep,\nquiet voice, dragging the table over between the three of them, then\nappropriating an empty chair and dropping into it, tucking his newspaper\ninto one pocket.\nHe looked around as if he had misplaced something, then tilted his head\nback, calling over his shoulder, “Celine!”\nA little girl detached herself from the café crowd, running between\ntables and chairs to join them. Without a word, he scooped her up and put\nher in his lap. His knee bounced her absently, and the girl laid her head on\nthe big man’s chest. It was a strange image, like a lamb curling up next to a\nbear. Vlora found the girl almost as interesting as the man – she was dressed\nas a boy, a shifty, watchful look in her eye that Vlora had seen in every\nmirror when she was that age. She was an orphan; a street child.\nVlora removed her hand from the hilt of her sword, but remained\nwatchful. “Can I help you?” she asked.\n“Good evening,” the big man said. “My name is Styke. I’m looking for\na job.”\nVlora glanced at Olem, who seemed more than a little bemused by the\nwhole situation. “I’m not entirely sure you’re in the right place,” Vlora said.\n“You’re General Vlora Flint,” Styke said, nodding at her and then Olem.\n“You’re Colonel Olem. You run the Riflejack Mercenary Company. I’m\nlooking for mercenary work. Seems like the right place.”\nVlora’s first reaction was annoyance. Barely five minutes into a pleasant\nevening with Olem, and this brute had come out of the woodwork to\ninterrupt it. Her second inclination was suspicion – if he really wanted a\njob, why hadn’t he approached them down at the keelboat landing?"

Her second inclination was suspicion – if he really wanted a\njob, why hadn’t he approached them down at the keelboat landing?\n“Styke, you said?” she asked.\n“That’s right.”\n“If you’d like, Styke, I can give you the name of my quartermaster.\nMeet with him tomorrow and see if you’re a good fit for the company. We\nare hiring a few more men. But I’ll warn you, mercenary work isn’t kind to\na cripple.”\nA torrent of emotions flew across Styke’s face, from confusion, to hurt,\nto anger, to rage, all in the course of a few seconds. Vlora would have been\nimpressed if she wasn’t so busy making a mental check that her pistol was\nloaded. Styke shifted in his chair, the wicker creaking dangerously, and\nstraightened his jacket as he visibly regained control of himself, squeezing\nthe girl gently as he did. “I’m sorry,” he said, “but my name’s Benjamin\nStyke, and I’m looking for a job.”\nVlora stuck her chin out. If this was a Palo or Blackhat plot of some\nkind, it was daft as pit. “Is that supposed to mean anything to me?” she\nasked.\nStyke frowned at her, his eyes hard, as if the scowl would jog her\nmemory, then he suddenly sagged. “Been too long,” he muttered. “Maybe it\ndoesn’t.”\nThe girl, Celine, fidgeted in Styke’s lap and scowled at Vlora. “Ben’s a\nkiller,” she declared. Styke shushed her gently.\n“I’m sure,” Vlora said. “Look. I don’t think the Riflejacks will be a\ngood fit for you. You look like you can handle yourself in a scrap, but we’re\nreal soldiers, not…” She trailed off, a light going on in the back of her head\nat the same time Olem touched her arm. “Ben Styke. Why do I know that\nname?”\nStyke perked up, but before he could answer Olem said quietly,\n“Taniel’s letters.” He leaned across the table, peering up into Styke’s face,\nshowing the type of interest that he normally reserved for a brand-new pack\nof tobacco. “You’re Mad Ben Styke?” he asked.\n“I am,” Styke said.\n“I thought you were dead.”\n“Most do,” Styke replied.\nVlora noted that Olem wasn’t just attentive. He was very interested, like\nhe’d just noticed a half-price sign on a beat-up supply wagon. “You were\nwatching us down at the keelboat landing earlier. Why?”\nStyke seemed taken aback. “Was just down at the market and saw you\nlanding. Heard you were the best mercenary company on the continent and\nI recently became… unemployed. So I thought it was fortuitous.”\nVlora spent Olem and Styke’s short exchange searching her memories,\nlooking for the name Ben Styke. Taniel’s letters talked a lot about the\npeople he’d met during his time fighting in the Fatrastan Revolution. She\ngrasped on to one memory in particular, a letter regarding a battle in which"

She\ngrasped on to one memory in particular, a letter regarding a battle in which\nTaniel had met a giant of a man, a lancer wearing enchanted medieval\narmor, who’d ridden into a torrent of enemy grapeshot, musket fire, and\nsorcery to save the battle and somehow come out on the other side.\nHis admiring descriptions of Ben Styke had seemed a silly fancy. Until\nnow.\n“You knew Taniel Two-shot?”\nStyke raised his eyebrows, seeming pleased. “I fought beside him\nonce,” he said. “Pit of a fighter. He mentioned me?”\n“Gushed about you, more like,” Vlora said. She leaned back,\nreconsidering everything that had gone through her head the last few\nminutes. This wasn’t just some big cripple looking for an excuse for rape\nand pillage. This was Mad Ben Styke, one of the heroes of the Fatrastan\nRevolution. Celine was right. He was a killer. “You still a lancer?” she\nasked, eyeing the leg he favored with his limp.\n“No,” Styke said, his face hardening. “They killed my horse after the\nwar. Took my armor. And then all this, and…” He drifted off, averting his\neyes.\nThere was a story behind that gaze, and Vlora felt the urge to ask him\nabout it. But there were some wounds you could ask an old soldier about\nand others you had to wait for him to tell. She wanted to offer him a job\nhere and now, but she couldn’t for the life of her think of what to do with\nhim. He was in no shape to hold a line, probably not even ride a horse.\nShe glanced at Olem, hoping for some levelheaded advice, but Olem\nwas still staring at Styke like a starstruck boy. “Did you really ride down a\nPrivileged at the Battle of Landfall?” Olem asked.\n“Put my lance through his eye,” Styke said, prodding a finger at his own\nface. “Nothing better than watching a Privileged die. They always have the\nstupidest looks on their faces, like how dare I murder him before he could\nmurder me.”\nOlem slapped his knee, guffawing, rocking back in his chair, and took\none of his pre-rolled cigarettes from his pocket, offering it to Styke.\nSo much for levelheaded advice.\n“You know they’ve written books about you?” Olem asked.\nStyke snorted. “Probably a bunch of bullshit.”\n“We’re soldiers,” Olem said. “It’s always a bunch of bullshit. Except\nwhen it’s not.” He turned to Vlora, with a face like a child asking to keep\nthe puppy he’d just brought in off the street. “I’ll give him a job if you\ndon’t,” he said.\n“We run the same bloody company,” Vlora said.\n“Pit,” Olem said, “I’ll put him on retainer just to sit around and tell war\nstories. The boys would love that.”\nVlora glanced at Styke out of the corner of her eye. His face had soured\nat the mention of war stories, and he said in a pained voice, “I’d rather be a\nlittle more useful than that.”"

Even if he\ncan fight, our boys are infantrymen. A guy like that is a brawler. No use\nputting him in a line.”\n“We can make use of him,” Olem said. “Didn’t you say earlier we\nneeded some locals to do some dirty work?”\n“I don’t remember saying that.”\n“I’m pretty sure you did,” Olem insisted.\nVlora sighed. Did she have a bad feeling about this Styke, or was she\njust avoiding saying yes because Olem was so insistent? “If you can figure\nout something to do with him, then we can…” Vlora stopped, holding up\nher finger, and looked at Styke. “You’ve been around a while?” she asked.\nStyke nodded.\n“Do you know anything about the Palo?”\n“Probably a little more than the average veteran,” Styke said. “A lot of\nthem were our allies during the war. Before all this.” He gestured at the city\naround them.\n“Do you speak their language?”\n“I’m a little rusty,” Styke said. “But yes. I can write it, too, in a pinch.”\n“Useful,” Olem observed, a little too eagerly.\nVlora shot him a look to be quiet. “All right, Ben Styke,” she said. “I’ve\ngot a task for you. It might sound stupid but if you can dig me up an answer\nyou’ve got yourself a job.”\nThe relief was plain on Styke’s face. “Yes, ma’am.”\n“You know anything about a Palo warrior wearing swamp dragon armor\nand fighting with bone axes?”\nStyke leaned back in his chair, regarding his coffee for the first time and\ndowning it in a single gulp before wiping his mouth on his sleeve. He\nsnapped his fingers, ordered another coffee and some spiced chocolate for\nCeline, then looked at a point of empty air between Vlora and Olem,\nconsidering. “Stories,” he said.\n“What kind of stories?”\n“Sounds like a dragonman – Palo warriors descended from the Dynize\nemperors that used to rule these lands. The Kez wiped them out sixty or\nseventy years ago for being such a nuisance, and they haven’t been seen\nsince. They were a fairy tale when I was a kid. ‘Eat your soup or the\ndragonmen will take you to the swamp.’ That kind of thing.”\nVlora felt the hair on the back of her neck standing on end. She knew all\nabout old stories and fairy tales, and just how true they could end up being.\n“One of them inflicted almost forty casualties on my men at Fort Samnan,”\nshe said. “We killed him in the end, but I’ve never seen anything like that\nshort of a powder mage or a Privileged.”\nStyke ran a hand through his short, gray hair. “Pit,” he swore gently. “I\ndidn’t think they still existed.”\n“Yeah, well it sounds like they do.” Vlora spat.

    "text": "didn’t think they still existed.”\n“Yeah, well it sounds like they do.” Vlora spat. The last thing she\nwanted was old fairy tales coming to life before she could finish her\ncontracts and get out of this damned country. “I want to know if there are\nany more of them hanging out in the city. We’re about to piss off the entire\nPalo population of Landfall and I’d rather not have more of these blasted\ndragonmen show up after we do it.”\n“I can take a look,” Styke said. He took his new coffee and spiced\nchocolate from the waiter, offering the latter to Celine, but the girl had\nfallen asleep. Vlora resisted the urge to shake her head at the sight. A\nbloody lamb and a lion.\nShe reached across the table, offering Styke her hand. “Welcome to the\nRiflejacks, Ben Styke. I look forward to seeing what you can do.”\nCHAPTER 9\nM\nichel waited outside the office of Captain Blasdell – the head of the\npublic side of his investigation – his pocket watch ticking away the\nminutes, and made a mental note that he needed to call upon a handyman.\nThe cracks in his mother’s roof needed to be patched, as well as the chair\nfixed. He considered the fact that he’d been given an unlimited budget to\nfind the Iron Roses and wondered if anyone was actually going to check his\nbudget expenditures on the case, or if he could get away with paying the\nfixer with Blackhat money.\n“Jes called me expendable. An investigation shouldn’t need an\nexpendable investigator,” he said to himself quietly as he watched Captain\nBlasdell’s door.\nHe answered with a cynical voice. “He did threaten to kill you if you\nfail.”\n“He did not.”\n“The man murders people for a morning workout, and those final words\nwere awfully ominous.”\n“The Blackhats don’t waste resources, and a Silver Rose like me is a\nresource. We’re all in this shit together.”\n“Maybe you’re expendable because he expects this to be dangerous.”\nMichel forestalled replying to himself, considering the implications.\nInvestigations could be dangerous. Someone willing to impersonate a\nBlackhat had to know the risks involved. Once they were found they would\nbe tortured and executed, their friends and family sent to the labor camps. If\nthey were willing to chance that, then they’d be willing to resort to\nviolence.\n“Or,” he considered out loud, “expendable means that he could bury my\ncareer if this goes wrong for some reason.” He couldn’t foresee a way of\nthis going wrong, but Michel readily admitted that Fidelis Jes was a smarter\nman than he. One didn’t run the Landfall Secret Police without being able\nto see many possibilities for the future of every decision.\nMichel took a deep breath. No need to waste his energy on worrying.\nHe needed to focus on the task at hand, and to do so he needed to talk with\nCaptain Blasdell.\nThe thought had barely entered his head when the door to Captain\nBlasdell’s office opened.

    "text": "thoughtful, narrow face and a pair of armless spectacles balanced on the\nbrim of her nose. A former police captain, she’d been brought into the\nBlackhats to help impose some sort of organization on their investigations.\nShe was technically a Silver Rose, but everyone treated her like a Gold. She\nwas the type of person Michel had heard referred to as the backbone of the\nBlackhats: incorruptible, unambitious, and competent.\nShe would never be promoted, yet never lose her rank. She was, in a\nfew words, not going anywhere.\n“You’re Michel Bravis?” she asked, ushering him into her office.\n“I am, ma’am. Thanks for seeing me.” Michel had met the captain on\nseveral occasions but wasn’t surprised that she didn’t remember him. There\nwere a lot of Blackhats, after all, and he was very good at blending into\ncrowds. He could thank his late father for a face so plain most people forgot\nit within minutes.\n“I didn’t have much choice.” Blasdell took a seat behind her desk and\ngestured to a few crates stacked on the corner. “Orders came straight from\nthe grand master’s office. I understand you are to have access to any\ninformation regarding my case.”\n“That’s right, ma’am.”\nBlasdell drummed her fingers on the desk, fixing him with a look that\nsaid she would not be handing over information willingly. “Why?”\n“I think that’s classified, ma’am.” Michel had no idea how much\nBlasdell had been told, and frankly he didn’t want to have to explain\neverything to her.\n“You think?”\n“Pretty sure. All that matters is I need any information you’ve dug up in\nthe last couple of days.”\nBlasdell leaned back, putting her boots up on her desk, the put-off look\nremaining fixed on her face. “The case is a farce,” she said. “I’ve only got a\nskeleton crew working it, and in a few days we’re going to trot out a\nscapegoat and put the whole thing to bed. Why do you need our\ninformation?”\nBlasdell had an odd relationship with the Blackhats. She was one of\nthem, and well regarded within the Millinery, but she never seemed to\nactually trust the people she worked with. Rumor had it Fidelis Jes found it\namusing, but also that it made her difficult to work with. Michel didn’t have\ntime to deal with her mistrust. “Because, ma’am, the grand master is letting\nyou do your job up until the scapegoat comes into play. Knowing your\nreputation, the skeleton crew has been working around the clock to come up\nwith leads in the hope you’ll solve this before Fidelis Jes makes the whole\nthing go away. Am I correct?”\nShe took her boots off the desk, eyes narrowed. “You are.”\n“Good. So what have you come up with in eighty hours?”\n“The facts are,” Blasdell said, drawing herself up and adopting a\nprofessional tone, “nine days ago fifteen messengers delivered fifteen\norders to fifteen different printing companies. Each of them ordered ten\nthousand copies of Sins of Empire and swore the printer to secrecy by\npresenting an Iron Rose.

The printers filled the order, and about eighty\nhours ago the first copy of the pamphlet hit the street. So far my\ninvestigation has cleared the actual printers of any wrongdoing. We’re using\ndescriptions of the messengers to try to round up some suspects, but so far\nwe’ve got nothing promising.”\n“How about the Iron Roses?”\nBlasdell tilted her head. “We were told not to approach the case from\nthat angle.”\nMichel considered Blasdell’s reputation. “But you have, haven’t you?”\n“I would never disobey a direct order.”\nMichel threw up his hands. “I don’t really give a damn about orders. I\nneed information, and anything you can tell me about those Iron Roses\nwould make my life a hundred times easier.”\n“And what do I get out of it?”\nMichel rolled his eyes. That mistrust that Blasdell was known for would\nbe twice as annoying if it wasn’t quite so warranted. People did things by\nthe book in the Millinery or life could take a nasty turn. But what could he\npossibly give her in return? She was a hardworking bureaucrat who went to\ngreat lengths to avoid Landfall politics. What did she want?\n“I could probably arrange a bonus.”\n“Not interested.”\n“How about for your men? This skeleton crew you’ve got working\naround the clock. What if I authorize time and a half for night work?”\n“You can do that?” Blasdell seemed skeptical.\nMichel considered his unlimited expense account. It was a risk, of\ncourse. Giving her some leeway with her men might give her the edge,\nletting her solve this case before they presented a scapegoat to the public. It\nwasn’t the worst possible scenario – a solved case was a solved case, and it\nwouldn’t ruin his career. But it wouldn’t get him his Gold Rose, either. On\nthe other hand, a bunch of grunts doing his work for him could be very\nuseful. “Yes.”\nBlasdell considered this a moment. “All right, Agent Bravis. We have a\ndeal. My men have discovered a few things. First of all, we know the Iron\nRoses weren’t forged. We checked with every jeweler and metalworker in\nthe entire city. No one would touch that kind of work.”\n“They could have been forged outside of the city.”\n“That’s a possibility.”\nOne that Michel couldn’t do anything about. He wasn’t going to travel\nall over Fatrasta on a wild goose chase, so he’d have to make the\nassumption that no one outside the city forged the Iron Roses, either. Michel\ntried to think like an investigator. He was a spy but, he supposed, a good\nspy should make a decent investigator. They always had their eyes open,\nfollowing rumors, digging up traitors. “Stolen?” he asked.\n“We’re following up on that. No Iron Roses are missing within the\nLandfall city limits. We’ve sent messages to our sister precincts all over the\ncountry.”\nNothing he could do about that but wait. “So it’s possible they were\noriginals?”\n“Possible,” Blasdell conceded.\n“What do you think?” Michel asked.\nBlasdell drummed her fingers on the desk. “I think they’re most likely"

    "text": "originals?”\n“Possible,” Blasdell conceded.\n“What do you think?” Michel asked.\nBlasdell drummed her fingers on the desk. “I think they’re most likely\nforgeries. They’d know we’d track them to their source, so they would have\ndone the forgeries outside of our influence.”\n“The Nine?”\n“It’s what I would do, anyway. Puts a lot of distance between us and\nwhoever did the forgeries, and we’ll likely never know who did it. That’s\nwhat I told the grand master two days ago, and in light of our investigation\nso far, I stand by it.”\nSomething clicked in Michel’s head. Fidelis Jes already suspected that\nthe source of the Roses would never be found. That’s why Michel needed to\nbe disposable. If nothing came up from the investigation before they buried\nit, Michel might be forced on the goose chase he’d just decided to avoid. He\nmight even have to sail to the Nine.\nHe was disposable in that the Blackhats could easily go on without him\nif he had a case that would take him a great deal of time.\nThe very thought of it made his stomach turn, and a panic seized his\nchest. He couldn’t spend the next several years chasing ghosts. His career\nwould stall, his mother would be left alone in Landfall, and he would never\nearn his Gold Rose. He needed to solve this thing, and fast.\n“Have your men write up everything you have on the investigation so\nfar and send it to my office. Keep them working. I’ll authorize a fat bonus.”\n“Is there something you want them looking for in particular?” Blasdell\nasked.\nMichel glanced at her sharply, but she didn’t look suspicious. She just\nseemed glad to have something real for her men to work on. “Double-check\nwith the local forgers. Keep digging around, and find out if any Iron Roses\nhave been reported missing or stolen.”\n“Have it all sent to your office?”\n“Yes, if you would. Thank you for your help, Captain.” Michel left the\ncaptain’s office, heading down the hall and toward the other side of the\nMillinery, where he had his own small, closetlike office. He rested there for\na few moments, considering his meeting. He hadn’t intended on taking over\nCaptain Blasdell’s investigation. In fact, he was fairly certain Fidelis Jes\nwould be furious if he found out. Best to keep it quiet then, and hope that\nBlasdell didn’t have occasion to bring it up before Michel could find the\nRoses.\nBlasdell thought they were foreign forgeries. Michel had no way of\ntesting that theory, so he thought it best to come at it from the opposite\ndirection.\n“What if they’re originals?” he asked himself.\n“Stolen?”\n“Or misplaced?”\nA thought occurred to him – one that made his jaw clench. “What if\nthey weren’t stolen? What if they were used by their rightful owners?”\n“Are you suggesting fifteen Iron Rose traitors?”\n“It’s possible.”\n“Not likely.”\nHe ran his hands through his hair, staring at the blank wall of his office.\n“I think,” he said, “I’m going to look at a few bank accounts.”\nCHAPTER 10\nV\nlora went to meet Michel Bravis on the edge of Greenfire Depths the"

    "text": "“I think,” he said, “I’m going to look at a few bank accounts.”\nCHAPTER 10\nV\nlora went to meet Michel Bravis on the edge of Greenfire Depths the\nafternoon after her arrival in Landfall. The sun was scorching, and she\nfanned herself with her bicorn, a skin of warm beer hanging from her saddle\nhorn as she rode at the head of the column snaking its way through the\nstreets of the plateau. Olem rode at her side, with no comment but for the\noccasional complaint about the heat.\nAround four o’clock Vlora called a halt as they reached a building that\nlooked suspiciously large and fortlike. It was a long wall of rotten timbers,\ntwo stories high and punctuated every so often by a guard tower. Almost\nevery inch of the wall was painted with graffiti in a dozen different\nlanguages or stuck with playbills advertising the latest ribald comedy. She\nlooked up and down the street, ignoring the people who stopped and stared\nat her column of troops.\n“This can’t possibly be it.”\nOlem consulted a map spread out across his saddle horn and then rode\nover to the nearest crossroads, peering up at the wooden placards. “This is\nit,” he said. “Loel’s Fort.”\n“That Bravis bastard promised me a barracks.”\n“Looks like a barracks to me,” Olem said.\n“It’s a fort. A frontier fort, by the looks of it, old enough that it was built\nwhen this was the frontier.”\n“Doesn’t look so bad,” Olem responded with a halfhearted grin.\n“This is supposed to be a modern city.”\n“Adopest still has a stone wall. The past sticks around.”\nVlora cleared her throat. “Why can’t we have the big fort out on the\nbay? What’s it called, Fort Nied?”\n“I think the garrison is stationed there.” Olem rode his horse about half\na block, then returned. “It looks cozy,” he reported unconvincingly.\n“You light a cigarette in that place and you’ll kill us all.”\nOlem’s look soured.\n“This can’t possibly be it,” Vlora repeated.\n“It is.”\n“How can you be sure?”\nOlem jerked his chin. “Because our contact is right there.”\nVlora turned to find Michel Bravis in the shade of a nearby awning, at\nease in the heat, his collar sweat-stained and his lapel undone, wearing the\nblack, offset-button shirt and ridiculous bowler hat, the Blackhat’s\ntrademark uniform. He gave Vlora a wave. Vlora resisted the urge to\nrespond with a rude gesture.\n“Good afternoon, ma’am,” Michel said as he crossed the street to join\nthem. He squinted up at the sun, as if it were the first time he’d noticed it\ntoday. “Bit warm out, isn’t it?”\n“Go to the pit,” Vlora answered. “You promised me a barracks.”\n“This is a barracks,” Michel said.\n“It’s a rotted ruin,” Vlora snapped. “If I’m going to be weeding out your\nproblems, potentially facing rioters, I want someplace my men can fall back\nto. A child throwing stones could break down those walls.”\nMichel walked over to the wall and kicked at one of the timbers. A"

    "text": "problems, potentially facing rioters, I want someplace my men can fall back\nto. A child throwing stones could break down those walls.”\nMichel walked over to the wall and kicked at one of the timbers. A\nsplinter the size of Vlora’s leg fell off. Michel stared at it for a moment,\nthen turned to her with a salesman’s smile. “Bit of paint. Some plaster. It’ll\nbe right as rain.”\n“I want something else,” Vlora said.\n“There is nothing else.”\nOlem cleared his throat. “It’ll do, Agent Bravis. But we’ll want supplies\nto get this fixed up, even if we have to replace every timber.”\n“I’ll see what I can do.”\nVlora shot Olem a look. Why didn’t he ever let her give anyone a good\nchewing out anymore? “How is this place even still standing?”\n“We used it during the war,” Michel answered. He turned to walk along\nthe wall and Vlora dismounted, handing Olem the reins and following\nMichel on foot. “I was just a kid at the time. I was one of the lucky ones\nthat got out before the Kez arrived, so I didn’t see it firsthand. It’s said that\nLoel’s Fort was the last defense at the Battle of Landfall, where we really\nturned the tide and fought the Kez back to the sea. Biggest battle of the\nwhole war, tens of thousands dying on both sides. If it wasn’t for the arrival\nof the Mad Lancers it would have ended here and I’d probably be speaking\nKez.”\nVlora exchanged a glance with Olem. It was the first time she’d heard\nof the Mad Lancers outside their meeting with Styke and Taniel’s letters.\n“Who are the Mad Lancers?” she asked, hoping she didn’t sound too casual.\n“Were,” Michel corrected. “Bunch of mean bastards who fought for us\nagainst the Kez. Ask around any pub in this town about Mad Ben Styke and\nI’m sure you’ll hear a thousand stories. Especially around here. Lots of\nveterans in this part of town.”\n“Ben Styke?” Olem echoed.\n“Everyone in Fatrasta knew his name. Damned near a legend.” Michel\nshrugged. “We’re not supposed to talk about him. He was executed at the\nend of the war for disobeying orders. Sullied name and all that. But you\nknow how legends are.”\n“They refuse to die,” Vlora said quietly.\n“Right you are, ma’am.” Michel reached the front gate of Loel’s Fort\nand pushed open one of the big doors to reveal an overgrown muster yard,\nfilled with lean-tos and a handful of dilapidated buildings. Michel’s smile\nfaltered for a moment, and Vlora swore under her breath. “Lots of paint,”\nMichel said helpfully.\nVlora did a quick circuit of the premises. Nothing she saw changed her\ninitial impression. The fort was a rotten dump. They must have thrown out\nhundreds of squatters to make room for her men. The least they could have\ndone was clean the place up a little, too. “There’s not enough room for five\nthousand men in here.”\n“There are two smaller forts within a few blocks of here,” Michel said,\nturning around and indicating opposite directions. “Loel’s Annex North and"

    "text": "thousand men in here.”\n“There are two smaller forts within a few blocks of here,” Michel said,\nturning around and indicating opposite directions. “Loel’s Annex North and\nLoel’s Annex South. Each of them has a proper barracks hall. That should\ngive you enough space. We’ll provide materials to repair any leaky roofs or\nbroken windows. Until then, I assume you and your men have tents.”\nVlora drummed her fingers against her leg and locked eyes with Olem.\nShe formed a ring with her hands, pointed at Michel’s neck.\nOlem shook his head emphatically.\nShe mouthed the word please.\nOlem rolled his eyes. Michel, examining the fort with a rueful look on\nhis face, didn’t seem to notice the exchange. He turned back toward them.\n“Have you seen the Depths yet?” he asked.\n“No,” Olem said, “we haven’t.”\nMichel crossed the muster yard and took the steps gingerly up to the top\nof the western fort wall. “You should be able to…” He called down. “Yep,\nyou can definitely see it from here.” He beckoned for them to join him.\n“I can’t get a read on him,” Vlora said quietly.\n“Agent Bravis?” Olem asked.\n“He’s so… bland. Polite, but not too polite. Ready smile. Attentive, but\nalmost distractedly so.”\n“I still think he’s a spy,” Olem said. “Think about it. That politeness is\nfeigned. We’ve both been around enough politicians to spot it, but he’s no\npolitician. I caught his eye a couple of times when he didn’t think I was\nlooking. He’s watching us carefully.”\n“Why would they assign a spy to us?”\n“Because that’s what the Blackhats do? Do you really think Lindet\ntrusts a mercenary company in her capital city?”\n“I suppose not.” Vlora took a few deep breaths, forgetting the Blackhat\nand looking around at their surroundings. This wasn’t how she wanted to\nstart their latest assignment, but she knew she needed to cool her heels. If\nOlem was right, anything she said would likely be reported straight back to\nthe people paying her commission. The last thing she needed to do was piss\noff an employer in a foreign city. “Promise me you can do something with\nthis dump,” she said quietly.\n“It’ll take some time,” Olem responded, “but I’ll put the men to work\nright away. We’ll have a defensible barracks within a couple of weeks.”\n“Right about the time we get our own spy network in place.”\n“Should be about the length of it, yes.”\n“Remember,” Vlora reminded, “we have just one month to find Mama\nPalo. We’re going to have to work quickly.”\nOlem gave her a reassuring wink, and she left him to oversee the\nbrigade’s move-in and joined Michel on the west wall. “What do you have\nto show…” What she saw below took her breath away.\nShe’d heard the stories. She’d even gotten a glimpse at the Depths as\nthey passed it on the keelboats in the gorge, but this… this was something\nelse. It was as if a god had reached down and pressed his thumb against the\nLandfall Plateau, leaving a two-hundred-foot-deep mark a mile in diameter."

    "text": "else. It was as if a god had reached down and pressed his thumb against the\nLandfall Plateau, leaving a two-hundred-foot-deep mark a mile in diameter.\nThe Depths wasn’t just an old quarry; it was practically a crater, and it was\njammed from one end to the other with tenements; roofs stacked with\nshantytowns and overgrown gardens, dilapidated construction that made\nLoel’s Fort look structurally sound. The tallest roofs almost came within\nspitting distance of the Rim while the bottom – she couldn’t even see the\nbottom beneath the chaotic hodgepodge of buildings.\nMichel was looking at her with a strange smile on his face. Vlora closed\nher mouth, straightened her belt, and said, “This is something else.”\n“It is, isn’t it?” Michel said, almost reverently. “I always like watching\nthe expression on a newcomer when they first see the Depths. No one’s ever\nready for just how big it is. I’ve never been to the mountains, but I imagine\nit’s like looking down on a valley that you didn’t expect hidden away\nbehind the peaks.”\n“I’ve never seen a valley packed with so much slum,” Vlora said. “What\ndid you say the population was?”\n“Nobody knows for sure,” Michel said, clearing his throat. His brief\nsense of wonder was replaced with helpful professionalism. “We suspect\nit’s somewhere around two hundred thousand, though.”\n“All crammed in that hole?”\n“Yes, ma’am. It’s bigger than it looks, though. The tenements have\nwhole road systems between floors, with cables that support hammocks and\ncommunity spaces. There’s even rumors that they’ve mined into the floor\nand gotten the old quarry pumps working again for subterranean space.\nThey make use of every inch down there, going up and down. They have\nto.”\n“And it’s all Palo?”\n“Mostly,” Michel said. “You get the occasional pocket of Kressian\nimmigrants that don’t know any better. Probably a few thousand old\nveterans that the Palo leave alone. But yes. Lots of Palo.”\nVlora couldn’t imagine such a thing. Even in Adopest, the worst slums\ntended to be no bigger than a few blocks, and they were scattered about the\ncity. Here Landfall had managed to combine all of its slums and jam them\ninto a literal hole in the ground. It was like a deep, festering sore on the\nLandfall Plateau, and the Lady Chancellor expected her mercenary\ncompany to sift through that to find a single Palo.\nWell. No sense in waiting around. “I’m going to go take a look,” Vlora\nsaid, heading back down the stairs without a backward glance. A few\nhundred men were already inside the fort, cleaning up the abandoned\nshantytown and inventorying supplies as the soldiers streamed through the\ngate. She passed Olem, got her sword and pistol from her horse, and fixed\nboth to her belt. “I’m going for a walk,” she told him.\nOlem frowned. “You should have an escort.”\n“No need for that,” she said firmly. This was often a prickly subject, and\nshe had no interest in a fight. “I’m not Tamas, and I’d rather not attract\nattention.”\nMichel caught up with her just outside the fort. “Lady Flint!”"

Will you accompany me on my walk?”\nMichel examined her with a mixture of horror and alarm. “It’s just\nMichel, ma’am. You’re not planning on going down into the Depths, are\nyou?”\n“I want to take a quick look around.”\n“Alone?”\n“Yes.”\n“You go down there and you won’t come back up.”\nVlora peered closely at Michel. He was genuinely worried. The man\nseemed absolutely certain that Greenfire Depths was some sort of a death\ntrap. Based on the construction alone she might agree, but… “You are\naware I’m a powder mage?”\n“Even powder mages can get lost. Or ambushed. Or overwhelmed.”\nVlora knew that better than most. She remembered a campaign through\nthe north of Kez, hunted by overwhelming numbers, cutting her way\nthrough enemy territory with the very men she eventually formed into her\nmercenary company. She’d survived that. She could survive a Palo slum.\n“I think I can handle myself, Agent Bravis.”\n“I’m sure you can, ma’am, and I say this with the deepest respect – it’s a\nmaze. You won’t be able to find your way out.”\n“Could you?”\n“Of course, ma’am, but I’ve lived in Landfall my whole life, back\nbefore the Depths belonged to the Palo.”\n“Well, then,” Vlora said with more than a little relish. “You should give\nme a tour.” And a real damned barracks next time.\nMichel froze. Vlora turned to face him, and could see him struggling to\nkeep a lid on a torrent of emotions. “Ma’am,” he finally said, “do you\nremember yesterday, when I said that Blackhats only go there in force? It’s\nbecause they’ll skin us alive if we get caught down there on our own.”\nVlora wondered if he really believed that. She’d heard of slums in Adro\nwhere the police preferred to work in numbers, but they feared a robbery\nand a beating; nothing so savage as straight-up torture. She shrugged. “Suit\nyourself,” she said, and continued to walk.\nShe heard a string of curses behind her, then Michel said, “Wait a\nmoment, ma’am.”\nHe disappeared into a nearby house and came back a moment later. His\nblack jacket and hat were gone, replaced by a workman’s brown jacket, the\nelbows patched and repatched, and a matching flatcap. Even the rose\nmedallion, which the Blackhats seemed to wear like shields, was no longer\nhanging around his neck. Perhaps he really did fear being skinned alive. “A\nchanging house,” he explained. “It’s always good to have a spare set of\nclothes lying around when you’re a Blackhat near Greenfire Depths.”\nMichel led her down several side streets until they reached a\nthoroughfare that descended by way of switchbacks down the side of the\nquarry wall. Within two switchbacks they were equal to the tops of most\ntenements, and after six Vlora was more than a little disconcerted that she\ncould not see the sky without looking straight up.

The ground soon leveled\nout, and her boots splashed in a filthy morass of sludge.\n“Welcome to the Depths,” Michel said.\nThe air was damp, stifling, and dim. There were only glimpses of the\nsky, and most of the light was provided by well-placed mirrors redirecting\nthe sun from the tops of the tenements. Michel noticed her examining one\nof the mirrors and said, “Courtesy of the Lady Chancellor, back before the\nPalo took over. It was a cheaper and safer way to light this place in the\ndaytime.”\n“It needs it,” Vlora said.\nMichel pulled the brim of his flatcap forward. “We should keep\nmoving,” he said.\nVlora pulled herself away from examining the distressing construction\nof the tenements, with walkways and curtains running between them, whole\nbuildings propped up by jacks and beams, and noticed that almost everyone\nwithin sight was staring at them. No, not at them. At her. Unlike Michel, she\nwas still wearing her hat and uniform. She wondered if these people knew\nwho she was, and that she’d spent the last year out in the frontier fighting\ntheir cousins for the government.\nPerhaps this expedition was as ill-advised as Michel suggested.\nAny sense of a real thoroughfare disappeared within a hundred paces.\nShe could barely see the sky now, and after they’d gone just a hundred more\nshe had to admit to herself that she was hopelessly lost. There was no sense\nof direction in this place, no recognizable landmarks. She was as good as\nunderground.\nShe also noticed the sudden silence. A few moments ago there had been\nchildren playing in the streets, vendors haggling with old women,\npedestrians strolling along the corridors. Now there were scarcely half a\ndozen people within eyesight and all of them heading the opposite\ndirection. She couldn’t help but feel the weight of watchful eyes between\nher shoulder blades. The silence seemed to make the stink worse, a noxious\nstench like rotten food and dead animals, and she now noticed the rats\nrunning every which way as they passed.\nThey took several twists and turns before Vlora said, “I think we’re\nbeing followed.”\n“We’re definitely being followed,” Michel agreed. His mouth was a\nfirm line, and they ducked down two more bends quickly. “It’s pretty\ncommon down here. I told you, the Palo are organized. They keep an eye\nout for strangers – anyone with a Kressian face that they don’t recognize. I\nwouldn’t be surprised if we’re being watched by Mama Palo’s own spies\nright now.”\nThe sense of helplessness that overcame Vlora as she tried to figure out\nwhich direction they were going was disconcerting, to say the least. Her\neyes darted between doorways and windows but there were too many\ncrannies to keep an eye on. An ambush down here, undertaken by a capable\nleader, could slaughter an entire brigade.\nHer brigade.\n“I think we should go,” Vlora said.\n“What do you think we’re doing?” Michel’s voice was on edge now, a\nlittle higher than usual, and before he’d finished the sentence they rounded"

She took a moment to catch her breath,\nlooking back over the surreal slums below them.\n“That,” she said, chewing on her words and trying to work the smell out\nof her nostrils, “is not a pleasant place.”\nMichel gave her a tight smile, as if to say I told you so, but followed it\nup with a sympathetic nod. “That’s putting it lightly. It used to just be a\nconfusing slum. Get lost, ask for directions, you’ll make your way back out\nby morning, perhaps with an empty purse. But now, with the Palo in charge,\nentire Blackhat squads go missing and are never heard from again.”\n“They really hate you, don’t they?”\n“Me?” Michel asked. “Ma’am, you seem like you prefer people to be\nhonest with you, so I’ll tell you this: They hate us. They may not know yet,\nbut word will spread who you are and who you work for. When it does,\nyour men will start disappearing.”\nThe words felt like a punch in the gut. What the pit had she gotten\nherself into, coming to a place where her men couldn’t be safe walking\ndown the street? Surely, this kind of thing should be familiar? The swamps\nof the Tristan Basin were just as impenetrable and dangerous, yet it felt like\na betrayal to come to a modern city and find the same kind of danger. But,\nshe decided, they’d managed in the swamps and they’d manage here.\n“Any advice I should give to my men if they get lost down in the\nDepths?” she asked. If you say ‘pray,’ I will punch you in the face.\nMichel scrunched his nose, gazing down over the edge of the Rim, then\nchecked his pocket watch. He swore to himself. “Advice? Yeah. Try to find\na quarry wall, then stick with it until you find a switchback out. Don’t leave\nthe floor of the quarry until you find a switchback because if you go up one\nof those tenements, your maze has become three-dimensional.” He checked\nhis watch again. “I’m sorry, ma’am, but I have several more meetings today.\nIs there anything else I can do for you?”\nAlways running off. Vlora glanced toward Loel’s Fort, where she could\nsee the company flag being hoisted. It reached the top of the flagpole,\njumped once, and the whole flagpole suddenly toppled over, raising a cloud\nof dust above the fort. That doesn’t bode well. “Yes,” she said. “I’m not\ngoing into that place without some sort of intelligence. You said you had\nagents in the Depths?”\n“Yes. Well. Sort of. Here,” Michel said, scribbling on the back of one of\nhis business cards and handing it to Vlora, who read the words and address.\n“The Ice Baron?” she asked.\n“He’s a businessman.”\n“Can he be trusted?”"

He can be trusted. I’d suggest being discreet about your\nmission.”\n“What’s our public reason for being stationed just outside the Depths?”\nVlora asked. “People are going to ask questions, after all. We’re a whole\ndamned army.”\n“We haven’t given one yet,” Michel said. “The propagandists are\nworking on it.”\nVlora gave a derisive snort. Propaganda was a normal part of any\ngovernment, but referring to their public relations office that way sounded\ndamned cynical, even for Blackhats. “How about this,” she suggested. “My\nmen have been put on ice until the next mission. We’ve been recalled\nbecause of the recent riots, and we’re here to keep the peace. While we wait\nfor our next assignment I have several engineers who have offered to begin\nreconstruction around the rim of Greenfire Depths.”\nMichel cocked an eyebrow. “Do you have several engineers?”\n“Very good ones,” Vlora said. “And I like to keep my men busy when\nthey’re not fighting. I’ve noticed that the Lady Chancellor seems to love\nconstruction projects, so let us knock down and rebuild a few tenements and\nit looks like we’re doing community good. Might even give us an excuse to\nsnoop around the Depths.”\nMichel mulled it over. “It might work. I’ll pass it up the chain of\ncommand.”\n“Let me know by tomorrow afternoon. People will begin asking\nquestions, and I want an official answer to give them.”\n“Very good, ma’am.” Michel tipped his hat and headed toward the\nbuilding where he’d left his Blackhat uniform.\nBack at Loel’s Fort, Vlora stood in the doorway to watch the organized\nchaos of an army setting up a new headquarters. Olem noticed her after a\nmoment and came by.\n“How did it go? Is it as horrifying as they say?”\n“No,” she replied. “I’d like to build a summer home here. Retire. Let the\ngrandchildren play in the streets.”\n“We’d have to have children first.”\nThat was a conversation she wasn’t having right now. “I’m being\nsarcastic. It’s a bloody maze. Makes my skin crawl, and not just because of\nthe sludge you have to walk through. I don’t like it one bit. Oh, and I may\nhave just set up a construction project for the engineers. Once they’re done\nrebuilding the fort, that is.”\nOlem looked aggrieved. “I’ll tell Whitehall. He’ll be thrilled. Do we\nhave a plan of attack for finding Mama Palo?”\n“I’m not sure,” Vlora answered, “whether the Blackhats thought they\ncould trick us into using force, but I am not going to fight my way through\nthat slum. We’re going to finesse this thing. Agent Bravis gave me a card\nfor someone called the Ice Baron. Know him?”\n“Businessman,” Olem said.\n“I gathered. Sounds like he’s our intelligence. Set up a meeting, and\nlet’s figure out how to get inside Greenfire Depths.”"

Set up a meeting, and\nlet’s figure out how to get inside Greenfire Depths.”\nCHAPTER 11\nS\nhe has me chasing a fairy tale,” Styke said, rolling the weight of his\nlancer’s ring back and forth between thumb and forefinger. It was barely\npast seven in the morning, and he stood at the far northern tip of the bay,\nsquinting at the ships out past the breakers, sailing into the morning sun\nwith the tide. His leg ached from the long walk, but he had a piece of\nhorngum in the corner of his mouth and felt better than he had in years. To\nthink, something as simple as watching the ships go out could make his\nheart glow.\nHe’d spent his first and second nights of freedom at a sailor’s hostel\nnear the docks. The single room, not much wider than a closet, felt like a\npalace, and the bunk pallet like a four-corner bed. Celine slept on the top\nbunk, snoring through the early morning hours as Styke lay awake listening\nto the sailors break bread in the common room downstairs.\n“A fairy tale,” he repeated to himself, counting the eighth ship to leave\nport in just under fifteen minutes. He remembered a time when two ships a\nday was considered an event in Landfall. Pit, he could still see the docks\nburning in his mind’s eye, set ablaze by the Kez navy, and wondering if\nthey would ever rebuild. A lot of horrible things could be said about Lindet,\nbut she had fulfilled her promise to turn Fatrasta into an economic power in\njust a single decade.\nStyke glanced down at Celine, who sat on the rocks beside him with her\nhead drooping sleepily into her lap. She could have stayed behind and slept,\nbut had insisted on coming with him without a word of complaint. “You\never heard any stories of the dragonmen?” he asked.\nCeline perked up, shaking herself awake. “No. Dad never told me\nstories. Taught me how to pick a lock and slip a pocketbook, but never any\nstories. Said stories were for babies and silly fools.”\n“Your dad was a prick,” Styke said.\n“I loved my dad.” Celine sniffed. “And he loved me.”\n“Doesn’t make him less of a prick. Listen – a thousand years ago, back\nwhen this land belonged to the Dynize, the dragonmen came out of the\ndeepest swamps. They were the greatest warriors of a people who thrived\non war, worth a hundred soldiers in any battle.” Styke drew his knife,\nexamining the blade in the morning sun before pointing it at Celine.\n“Dragonmen were trained from birth to be fierce, bold, and give no quarter.\nThey proved themselves in their adolescence by killing the biggest swamp\ndragon they could find. They fashioned armor from its skin and axes from\nits bones and were blessed by the bone-eyes – the blood sorcerers. Made\nthem damn near invincible.”\nCeline stared up at him, transfixed. “And?”\n“And no one knows anything else about them,” Styke said. “It’s been\nlost in time. The Kez killed the last of the dragonmen decades ago, and the"

    "text": "“And no one knows anything else about them,” Styke said. “It’s been\nlost in time. The Kez killed the last of the dragonmen decades ago, and the\nDynize Empire hasn’t been seen outside of Dynize in over a hundred\nyears.”\n“Lady Flint said her men killed a dragonman.”\n“Maybe,” Styke said. He had his doubts. Perhaps a fierce Palo warrior\nslaughtered some of her men. Perhaps that warrior even fought in the\ntraditional dragonman garb. But the dragonmen were long gone.\nHe stared out at the rising sun. More was the pity. Few warriors – real\nwarriors – existed anymore. This was a world of assassins and soldiers –\npeople who killed in the dark or in formation. In his mind powder mages\nwere the last true warriors and even they preferred to use their sorcery to\nkill at a distance. He briefly imagined Lady Flint dueling one of these\nfabled warriors, and it brought a smile to his face. That would be a fight to\nsee!\n“Lady Flint and that Olem fellow seemed to know who you were.”\nStyke reached down and tousled Celine’s hair. “I thought they might not\nfor a minute.”\n“But they did. Were you really as big a hero as they said? People in the\nlabor camps called you a killer, but I didn’t know you were a hero.”\n“In a time of war, killing makes you a hero, so…” Styke shrugged. “I\nguess I was, in a way.”\n“Have you killed a lot of men?”\n“Hundreds.”\nShe was silent for a moment as she absorbed the number. “Do you\nregret it?”\n“Sometimes.”\n“My dad strangled an old woman once,” Celine said. “She woke up\nwhile he was taking the family silver. But it wasn’t during war, so I guess\nhe wasn’t a hero.”\n“Real piece of work, your dad.” Styke tongued the bit of horngum in the\ncorner of his mouth. “Why didn’t he hang for it?”\n“No one caught him. He was only sent to the camps later on for\nthieving. Why didn’t you hang for all the people you killed?”\nStyke looked down at her. It occurred to him he should be annoyed with\nall the questions, but he found they made him all the more fond of her. It\nreminded him of his little sister. Always asking questions, always trying to\nseek out the how and why. But that was decades ago. Before everything\nchanged. “Because I was Mad Ben Styke,” he said. “I killed for my country,\nso they slapped medals on my chest until I wasn’t convenient anymore, then\nsent me to the camps.”\n“Could you kill a dragonman?” Celine asked.\n“I haven’t fought anything I couldn’t kill,” Styke said, testing the blade\nof his knife, then sucking the blood off the tip of his thumb. “But I was\nyounger back then. Stronger. I’m pretty good at choosing my battles, and I\nwouldn’t choose to fight a dragonman. Not one out of the stories anyway.”\nHe sighed, putting his knife away, and lifted Celine to her feet. “They don’t\nexist anymore, so I’m not worried.”\n“If they don’t exist anymore, what are you going to do?” Celine asked."

He remembered the admiration on Olem’s face, and the\nskepticism on Flint’s, when they agreed to take him on. He had a nagging\nsuspicion that they’d brought him on out of pity and the very thought\nalmost made him sick.\nHe wasn’t even sure why it bothered him so much. Tampo was his real\nemployer, and his only job was to get close to Lady Flint. He was well on\nhis way to doing it. “I want to be useful again,” he muttered to himself.\n“What?” Celine asked.\n“Nothing.” Styke took her by the hand. “We’re going to see Old Man\nFles. He might have a shadow or two for us to chase.”\nOld Man Fles sat out in front of Fles and Fles Fine Blades, a breakfast of\nmilk and bread pudding balanced on his lap, watching as the early morning\ncustomers passed his booth to reach the food vendors farther into the\nmarket.\n“Looks dead,” Styke commented, sidling up next to the Old Man.\nFles tipped the brim of his flatcap back. “Nobody buys knives and\nswords at this hour. Our sales happen around midday, when the dandies and\nmerchants’ wives go shopping.”\n“Used to be a lot more morning traffic.”\n“Morning duels have gone out of fashion,” Fles answered.\nStyke remembered what Fles had told him about Fidelis Jes’s habits.\n“Not with Fidelis Jes. You have any more information about him?”\n“Pff.” Fles shot him an irritated glance. “It’s been what, forty hours?\nHave some patience, boy. If you think I’m going to go running to my\ncontacts demanding answers about the Blackhat grand master, you’re sorely\nmistaken.”\n“I thought you might work quickly. For old times’ sake.”\nThe irritated glance lasted twice as long this time. “I’ve always liked\nyou, Ben, and I’m glad to see you’re still alive even if you do look uglier\nthan a skinned cat. But don’t push it. I still fully expect my daughter to fillet\nyou when she gets back, so what’s the hurry?”\n“I owe him,” Styke said quietly.\n“Oh, calm down. I’ve already put out some feelers and Fidelis Jes isn’t\ngoing anywhere. What are you doing back here, anyway? I’ll be mighty\npissed off if you bring the Blackhats around.”\n“Have they come by to ask after me?”\n“Not yet,” Fles said. “But you better avoid the market. Me and Ibana\ncan keep secrets, but I’ve got apprentices now and there’s far too many eyes\nhere. If you want to chat, come by the house.”\n“Do you still own the old place in Greenfire Depths?”\n“Of course.”\n“I thought the Depths belong to the Palo now.”\n“They leave us alone,” Fles said with a shrug. “The Fles name demands"

You think I’ve been sharpening Palo\nkitchen knives for free out of the kindness of my heart? Besides, I’ve never\nmet a Palo who wants a piece of Ibana.”\n“Not the piece she’d give them,” Styke said, smirking at the Old Man.\nFles rolled his eyes. “Yeah, well. Like I said, you shouldn’t be seen\naround here.”\n“All right, all right. I’m going.” Styke glanced over his shoulder,\nsearching the crowd for Celine. “One last question. This is going to sound\nstupid, but have you heard anything about the dragonmen coming back?”\nHe expected a condescending grin and to be laughed out of the market.\nInstead, Fles removed his flatcap and scratched his head, looking\nthoughtfully up at Styke. “Funny you should ask that. There’s been rumors\nabout men in swamp dragon leathers down in Greenfire Depths. Nothing\nsubstantiated, and everybody thinks it’s just Mama Palo playing with the\nBlackhats, but you’re not the first person to mention dragonmen to me this\nweek. And nobody has talked about them in more than hushed tones since I\nwas a kid.”\nStyke scoffed. “Dragonmen in Landfall? That’s ridiculous.”\n“I’m just telling you what I heard.” Fles threw up his hands. “Sounded\nridiculous to me, too, but everything’s been crazy since the revolution. The\nNine has gone to complete shit. The Adran king was put to death. People\nsay Kresimir returned during the Adran-Kez War, gods fought and died,\nthen Kez tore itself apart with their own civil war. The world’s not right,\nBen. The dragonmen returning? Well, anything could happen. If you want\nto find out about the dragonmen, though, you’ll have to ask the Palo.”\n“Maybe I will.” Styke left Old Man Fles muttering gloomily to himself\nby the front of the smithy and found Celine working her way through the\nshops. They left the market together, wandering south through the docks\nand then taking a hackney cab down through the industrial quarter and then\nto Upper Landfall, so Styke could get a look at the city he’d been absent\nfrom for so long.\nAnd so he could think.\nEverything he’d heard since being released told him that the Palo were a\npowder keg right now – not something he wanted to put his nose into. But\nOld Man Fles was right. If the dragonmen had returned, it was doubtful\neven the Blackhats would know. Only the Palo would be able to tell him.\nHe wondered if Flint knew exactly how dangerous it would be for Styke\nto hunt down answers regarding the dragonmen. Doubtful. She thought him\na worthless cripple before she found out who he was – or rather, who he\nused to be. Searching Greenfire Depths for the most dangerous warriors in\nPalo history seemed far and above what she’d expected him to do.\nBut if he got her some real answers – if he had solid evidence that the"

Searching Greenfire Depths for the most dangerous warriors in\nPalo history seemed far and above what she’d expected him to do.\nBut if he got her some real answers – if he had solid evidence that the\ndragonmen were, in fact, real and of what they were up to – he might wind\nup as part of her inner circle.\nExactly where Tampo wanted him.\nStyke directed the carriage back around the western half of the plateau\nand through northern Landfall until he’d made a complete circuit of the city.\nIt was well after noon when he found Old Man Fles back in his workshop,\npolishing his latest blade.\n“I thought I told you not to come back here anymore,” Fles said.\n“I won’t,” Styke promised. “But I need you to do something for me.”\n“What?”\n“Set up a meeting.”\n“With who?”\n“A dragonman.”\n“That’s the stupidest thing —”\nStyke cut him off. “Just let it slip in the right places that the son of an\ninfluential Adran merchant wants to meet a dragonman. Say he’ll pay a\nhuge amount of money just to be able to talk to one for a few minutes. Say\nI’m a historian.” Styke found a piece of paper and wrote down an address.\n“Set up a meeting at this pub, and let me know when to be there.”\nFles fingered the paper. “You’re going to attract all the wrong kinds of\nattention.”\n“That’s the idea.”\n“You’re mad.”\nStyke took Celine’s tiny hand in his and turned to leave, throwing a\ncrooked grin over his shoulder. “That’s what they say.”\nCHAPTER 12\nW\nhen Vlora knocked on the door to a large townhouse about half a mile\neast of Greenfire Depths, the last thing she expected to see when the\ndoor opened was a tall, stocky man with the dusty skin of a Rosvelean and a\nblack bearskin draped over his shoulders. His face was red, sweat pouring\nfrom his brow, and he was dressed more like someone from the Adran\nMountainwatch than a Landfall native. He looked from Vlora to Olem, then\nback to Vlora.\nVlora opened her mouth, but he spoke first. “Lady Flint?” he asked in a\nthick Rosvelean accent.\n“Yes,” she said slowly. “I’m looking for Baron Habba… Habber…”\nThe man grinned at her. “Baron Vallencian Habbabberden,” he said\nproudly, throwing the door open. “Come in, come in. Agent Bravis said to\nexpect you.”\nVlora exchanged a glance with Olem, then followed the big man inside,\nthrough the hall, and into a sitting room on the left. She was surprised to\nfind the foyer, hall, and sitting room entirely devoid of furniture. There\nwere no wall hangings, decorations, or even lamps other than a few gas\nlanterns hanging from the walls. There also appeared to be no staff, despite\nthe house being big enough to need a full retinue of servants.\nThe big man went to the mantelpiece, leaned against it, and produced a\npipe from his pocket that he quickly puffed to life. “Lady Vlora Flint.\nStanding in my own home.

I was born in a tent smaller than this\nroom and now I own four of these damned houses. I don’t have the first\nidea what I’m supposed to put in them.”\nOlem cleared his throat and turned to one side to cough, clearly trying\nnot to laugh.\n“You’re the Ice Baron?” Vlora asked, more than a little skeptical.\n“I am. Don’t try to say my name, nobody can. Just call me the Baron, or\nVallencian to my friends. And you, Lady Flint, are my friend. I read your\nbiography. It was very good.”\nWhat the pit is he talking about? “I don’t have a biography.”\n“You do,” the Baron assured. “It was written by a Rosvelean mercenary\nwho served in the Kez Civil War. Excellent stuff. I’ll have a copy translated\nand sent to you.”\n“Thank you? I think?”\n“It is nothing. You must be Colonel Olem.” Vallencian suddenly lurched\nforward, shaking both their hands warmly. “You like cigarettes, yeah? Try\none of these.” He removed a box from his jacket pocket and flipped it open\nwith one hand to reveal a line of pre-rolled cigarettes.\nOlem beamed. “Don’t mind if I do.”\nVlora waved away the offer as Olem lit his, trying to get a read on this\nIce Baron. He was obviously a foreigner, obviously relished his status as\nsuch, wearing such a damned getup in this heat. “Forgive me if this is rude,\nbut are you really a baron?”\n“Are you a lady?” Vallencian shot back. He immediately threw up his\nhands. “I joke, I joke. I was born in a village in northern Rosvel, high up in\nthe mountains. I bought a barony last year, but I’ve never been to it. A\ncousin manages the thing. Poorly, I understand. But I’ve been called the Ice\nBaron for far longer, just as you have been called Lady Flint for longer than\nyou’ve had a title.”\nVlora glanced at Olem. “I’ve never had a title. Lady Flint is just\nsomething that someone called me once, and it stuck.”\nVallencian seemed to consider this, his brow furrowing. “That\nbiography. I won’t send it to you. It’s shit.”\nOlem couldn’t cover up his laugh that time, and Vallencian joined in\nwith a chuckle. “Ah,” he said, rubbing the back of his head, “I’m sorry for\nthe state of this place. I’d say it’s new, but it’s been unfurnished for three\nyears now. My footman just recently convinced me to buy a bed.” He patted\nthe bearskin on his shoulders. “All I need is Rangga here under my head\nand the saints sing me to sleep. And chairs? Ostentatious, I tell you.”\n“Don’t you entertain?” Olem asked. “I mean, I’ve heard your name\nseveral times around the city. You run in prestigious circles.”\n“I am very entertaining,” the Baron said, grinning in a way that made it"

    "text": "several times around the city. You run in prestigious circles.”\n“I am very entertaining,” the Baron said, grinning in a way that made it\nobvious he knew what Olem had meant. “But I prefer to be a guest, rather\nthan have guests. It feels more right to me. Gives me an excuse to give\nexpensive gifts to my hosts, instead of just offering some wine and a bite of\nfood. And with no hosting, I don’t have to employ a bunch of assholes.\nSpeaking of which, where is my damned footman?” He rolled his eyes.\n“Useless. I sent him out for dinner. I asked for lobster. Have you seen the\nlobsters here? I’ve never seen something so ugly, and when I first saw it I\nthought, I must kill it and eat it and now” – he smacked his lips – “I love\nit.”\nVlora recognized when a man liked to talk, and it was already very clear\nthat it was one of Vallencian’s favorite hobbies. Talkers, she knew, could go\non for hours if you didn’t put a stop to it right away, so she coughed into her\nhand and said, “Baron, you said Agent Bravis had told you to expect us?”\n“Yes, yes, of course. You want information about the Palo?”\n“Greenfire Depths, specifically.”\n“Ah, the Depths.” The Baron gazed at the ceiling, as if remembering a\nwalk in a particularly striking park. “Have you ever seen anything like that\nbefore?”\n“It’s a rat’s nest,” Vlora responded bluntly.\nVallencian shook a finger at her. “There is beauty in a rat’s nest;\nwarmth, security, companionship. There is all of that and more in Greenfire\nDepths, and I try to tell that to the Blackhats but does anyone listen to\nVallencian? No.”\nVlora examined the baron’s face. In some of the circles she’d traveled in\nAdro they would consider him a simpleton, but no simpleton amassed a\nfortune that would allow him to buy a barony after having been born\npenniless in a mountain village.\n“Exactly how familiar are you with the Depths?” Olem asked. “And you\nmust tell me where you got these cigarettes. This is terrific.”\n“I’ll send you the name of my tobacconist. And I’m quite familiar. I\nmeet with my business partners there every week. It’s a very pleasant place\nonce you get used to it.”\nVlora shuddered, remembering the sense of dread she felt on just a short\nwalk through the narrow corridors with Michel. “I’ll take your word for it.\nYou’re telling me that you openly do business in Greenfire Depths, but you\nwork for the Blackhats?”\n“‘Work’ is a strong word,” Vallencian said. “I did not get this rich to\nwork. The Blackhats come by every few weeks and ask me questions about\nwhat I’ve seen and heard in Greenfire Depths. I tell them. I also give them a\nsubstantial bribe and in return, they leave my ships alone. The Palo know of\nthis, and they don’t speak of anything within earshot that I might pass on.\nIt’s a good relationship. I try to operate my business without, how do you\nsay, guile?”"

I try to operate my business without, how do you\nsay, guile?”\n“And you can travel freely in Greenfire Depths?”\n“I avoid the bad neighborhoods.”\n“The entire thing is a bad neighborhood,” Olem said.\nVallencian tilted his head at them. “Let me tell you something about\nGreenfire Depths. It has its own, what do the naturalists call it, ecosystem?\nIt is its own world. It has its own economy, social classes, armies, even its\nown weather. To all the high and mighty in Upper Landfall the Depths looks\nlike a shithole. But the Depths has its own slums, the worst of the worst,\nand its own palaces – places that would make you gasp upon sight. It is as\nvaried as the city in which it resides.”\nVlora rocked back on her heels, chewing on her lip. “That sounds\ncomplicated.”\n“It is complicated. It’s taken me years to work it out myself.”\n“What,” Olem asked, “is it you sell down there?”\n“The only thing I do sell,” Vallencian responded. “Ice.”\n“Ice?” Vlora echoed.\n“When I was young, I made a small fortune in Rosvel in the beef\nindustry. I came to Fatrasta, and the first thing I noticed was how damned\nhot it was. In Rosvel, they bring ice down from the mountains to keep food\nand drinks cool during the summer months.”\n“Same in Adro,” Vlora said.\n“Yes, and my family has done so for generations. Anyway, I spent my\nfortune on a ship to bring ice to Fatrasta.”\n“And people bought it?”\n“The ice melted.”\n“Oh,” Vlora said.\n“So I packed it in sawdust, I did another trip.” Vallencian scratched his\nchin. “The ice made it all the way here, and you know what I learned? No\none wanted ice. Nothing here is cold, not even the mountains, and when no\none knows of the cold they have no use for it. I lost everything. Then the\nwar came. I smuggled guns for Lindet in the only thing I had left to my\nname: a rowboat. Smuggled some more guns, bought a yacht, smuggled\nsome cannons, then the war ended. Spent my money on a new ship and\nbrought more ice over to Fatrasta. Most of it melted before I could sell it,\nbut then a funny thing happened.”\n“Yes?”\n“The Palo decided they liked iced coffee. It caught on, and the\nFatrastans and the Kressian immigrants began to ice their tea and now,\nabout eight years later, here I am.”\n“You’re very persistent,” Olem observed.\n“Persistence has earned me ninety-eight merchantmen and almost three\nhundred warehouses across Fatrasta and Rosvel. And,” he said, looking\naround, “these big damned empty houses I don’t know what to do with.”\nVallencian brought a hand to his chin. “Maybe I should bring more of my\ncousins over.”\nVlora let out a low whistle.

And he didn’t have a\nbutler or a stick of furniture. What a strange man.\n“So,” Vallencian finished, spreading his hands. “That is who I am, and\nthat is my relationship with the Palo. I’ll help you how I can.”\nVlora had thought long and hard about what information to share, and\nwhat not, and she decided for Vallencian’s safety it was best to pare back\neven that. “My company has been assigned to the rim of Greenfire Depths.\nWe’re going to undertake some public works projects and act as a garrison.”\n“The Palo are not going to like that,” the baron said, thrusting a finger at\nher. “They know who you are.”\n“That’s what I need help with. I want to learn more about the Palo and\nfind out how we can coexist. I don’t want my men disappearing when they\ngo out on patrol. I want a truce.”\n“And you think I can get that for you? Hah. Agent Bravis has\nexaggerated my place among the Palo. I’m just a businessman. An\noutsider.”\n“Bravis didn’t tell me anything, actually. But it’s clear that you’ve made\nit into the Palo inner circle. And that’s what I want to do. For everyone’s\nsafety.” Vlora chewed on her words for a moment, hoping they didn’t sound\ndisingenuous. This was for everyone’s safety. But she was trying to capture\nthe Palo’s matriarch, and she found that leaving that out of the conversation\nmade her feel a little guilty. She liked Vallencian. Lying, even by omission,\nfelt distasteful. “Is there anyone I can meet to make that kind of deal with?”\nThe baron waffled on the question for a moment. “Perhaps I can\nintroduce you to a few.”\n“What about this matriarch I’ve been hearing about? This Mama Palo?\nIs she the one who makes those decisions?”\nVallencian scoffed. “No outsiders talk to Mama Palo.”\n“Have you met her?”\n“Haven’t even seen her. I’ve talked to a few of her lieutenants, but never\nher.”\n“Is she a myth?”\n“If she is, someone down there is playing the world’s biggest joke on all\nof us, including the Palo. Mama is real. The Palo believe it. The Kressians\nbelieve it. Blackhats have been trying to catch her for years.” Vallencian\nsquinted at Vlora, but made no further comment on the matter. “If you want\nto make some sort of a truce with the Palo, you need to meet the right\npeople. There is a gala in Greenfire Depths in a few days. I’ll see if I can\nget you an invitation.”\n“A gala?” Vlora asked. She exchanged a glance with Olem, trying not to\nsmirk.\n“I told you,” the baron said, “slums and palaces. Whole ecosystem.\nWhere are you staying?”\n“Loel’s Fort,” Olem said.\n“Very good. I will get an invitation and send it to Loel’s Fort. Hopefully"

Hopefully\nI will see you at the gala then.”\nVlora and Olem were shown out by the baron and returned to their\nwaiting hackney cab, where they sat in puzzled silence.\n“Did you know I had a biography written about me in Rosvel?” Vlora\nfinally asked.\n“Had no idea,” Olem responded, crushing out his cigarette on the wall\nof the cab. “But these cigarettes are amazing.”\n“You’re not helpful.”\n“He’s a strange man,” Olem said, answering her unspoken question,\n“but I think we can trust him. He’s got an honest face.”\n“Yeah, so do a lot of horse traders.”\n“If you don’t trust him, we won’t use his help. I asked around before we\ncame, though, and he’s known as a fair, open businessman. Everyone seems\nfairly baffled by his success because he seldom takes opportunities to cheat\nanyone.”\nVlora bit the inside of her cheek, mulling it over. “We’ll see if he comes\nthrough on the invitation. I’ve been down into the Depths. There’s no\nbeauty there, and I’m not fighting through it to find this Mama Palo. We’re\ngoing to have to do it” – she imitated Vallencian’s accent – “with, how do\nyou say, guile.” Vlora switched benches, moving over next to Olem, and put\nher head on his shoulder.\n“All right,” Olem agreed, putting his arm around her, “but I’m not\nsending you down there without a whole damned regiment as an escort.”\nCHAPTER 13\nM\nichel knew that the messengers who’d delivered Sins of Empire to the\nprinters were his best bet at tracking down the Iron Roses. They would\nbe discovered sooner or later. Fifteen people were fourteen too many to\nkeep a secret, and the fact that so many were involved in a conspiracy and\nhad still not been discovered almost two weeks later was damned\nimpressive. He didn’t have time to wait for someone to get dragged in off\nthe street, though. He needed answers immediately, and that meant turning\na direction in his investigation that few other Blackhats would be willing to\ngo.\nHe spent two precious days following a hunch. He visited banks,\nransacked a house and an apartment, and generally kept himself busy until\nhe had all the information he needed and returned to the very place one\nshouldn’t be looking for suspects in a plot against her Lady Chancellor’s\ngovernment.\nThe Millinery.\n“Light” corruption ran deep among the Blackhats. Most, including\nMichel himself, considered it a perk of the job. Blackhats wound up with\nfree meals or cups of coffee, or rushed to the front of the line in a\ngovernment office. Neighbors might pitch in to pay your rent, because a\nBlackhat in the neighborhood generally discouraged the local gangs. Michel\npreferred to use his own leverage in places he couldn’t afford normally –\nnice hotels, banks, tailors, high-end brothels.\nBut while that light corruption was tolerated, it was an unspoken rule\nthat you never let your greed get the better of you.

There was a line\nsomewhere – though not strictly defined – and if you crossed it you’d be\nout on your ass, maybe even sent to a labor camp.\nWhich is why Michel felt a pang of sadness as he rounded a corner in\nthe basement of the Millinery to find a hallway that dead-ended in a single\ncounter. A cage was built in around the counter, like one might find in the\nback of a casino in a shady part of town, and the door to the right of it was\nreinforced with steel and locked from the inside. An older gentleman,\nbalding and lean, sat behind the cage with his feet up on the counter. He had\na book in one hand – the same kind of penny novels Michel’s mother loved\n– and an apple in the other.\n“Agent Bravis,” he called before Michel had reached the counter. “What\nbrings you down to the Treasury today?”\n“Afternoon, Bobbin.” Michel reached the cage and leaned against it,\ncraning his head to get a look at the title of the book. He searched his\npockets, wishing that he carried a flask. “New dreadful?”\nBobbin gave Michel an embarrassed smile and stashed the book under\nthe counter. “Yeah. You know how it gets. Time crawls by down here.”\n“I bet,” Michel said. He considered winding his way through the daily\ngossip – Bobbin managed to hear everything down here – but knew that\nwould only be delaying the inevitable. “Bobbin, did you get your Gold\nRose recently?”\n“Me?” the treasurer scoffed. “I’m a Silver for life, Michel. Not much\nroom for improvement down here. How about you? Ever get your Gold? I\nknow you’ve been working for it for a while.”\n“No,” Michel said, picking at his fingernails. “Not yet.”\n“I heard they gave you babysitting duty with those Adran mercenaries.\nIs Lady Flint as pretty as they say in the gossip columns?”\n“She’s like an old shoe,” Michel lied. “Lost an eye a couple of years\nago. Teeth falling out. Not a pretty picture.”\nBobbin squinted at him. “You pulling my leg?”\n“Might be.” Michel scratched his chin. Pit, this was going to hurt.\n“Bobbin, have you heard about this thing with the Sins of Empire?”\n“The pamphlet that’s going around? I heard that Captain Blasdell is\nworking around the clock on it, trying to find out who would order such\ndamaging propaganda.”\nBobbin didn’t mention anything about the Roses, which meant Fidelis\nJes had kept it out of the newspapers and out of the general gossip among\nthe Blackhats themselves. Blackhats couldn’t gossip to anyone but their\nfellows, but boy did they love to do just that.\n“Did you hear about the Roses?” Michel asked.\n“What about them?”\n“Not many people know it, but that pamphlet got printed because the\npeople who ordered them were all carrying Iron Roses.”\nBobbin shifted in his chair. “That’s insane. No one would impersonate a\nBlackhat like that.”\n“They definitely did,” Michel said. “But you’re right. It’s insane. The"

The\npropaganda is one thing – Captain Blasdell is all over that – but those Iron\nRoses are something else entirely. We’ve been trying to figure out where\nthey came from.”\nThe smile disappeared from Bobbin’s face. He looked a little sickly.\n“Now,” Michel continued, “Captain Blasdell thinks they were forged by\nsomeone out of the country. It certainly makes sense. But me? I think they\nwere originals. All the originals in Landfall have been accounted for – I\nbelieve you made that report yourself just a couple of days ago, right?”\n“That’s right,” Bobbin said, licking his lips. “Every one of them is\naccounted for. You can even come back here and count them if you like.”\n“Of course, of course,” Michel said. “I believe you. But I’ve got to\nfollow my train of thought here. If the Iron Roses were originals, and\nhaven’t been stolen from the Millinery, that means they came from our own\npeople. But it doesn’t add up. Iron Roses are rarely reported as lost, and,\nthanks to the reputation of our grand master, are pretty much never stolen.\nAnd me? I think the idea that fifteen of our own Iron Roses were involved\nin an antigovernment plot seems a bit far-fetched.”\n“Michel,” Bobbin said, his voice shaky, “I really should get some work\ndone.”\nMichel ignored him. “So I thought to myself: Self, where does anyone\nget fifteen Iron Roses? And I answered: the Treasury, of course. And who’s\nin charge of the Treasury? My old friend Bobbin.”\nBobbin went red. His mouth flapped a few times, then his jaw tightened\nand he sat up straight. “I don’t know what you’re implying,” he said, “but\nyou’d better watch your mouth, Agent Bravis. You know there’s\nconsequences for false accusations around here.”\n“I know,” Michel said. “That’s why I checked first. I went through your\nhouse this morning, and your apartment that’s not on the books last night. I\nfound the receipts from the Starlish Bank. Half a million krana is a lot of\nmoney. And you’ve been spending like a fool, too. Clothes, booze, women.\nI checked all your haunts and you’re not being nearly as careful as you\nthink you are. And before you start trying to come up with a story about me\nfabricating evidence, you should know I’m hunting around on private\norders of the grand master. He’s going to examine my report personally and\nyou know he’ll find things that even I couldn’t.”\nBobbin’s face went from red to white in the course of a few moments.\nHis breath was shallow, a sheen of sweat on his forehead. Michel hated\nseeing him like this. He was a trusted Blackhat, a Silver Rose with the only\nkeys to the Treasury outside Fidelis Jes. He was supposed to be as inviolate\nas the Roses themselves, and what’s more is that Michel liked Bobbin.\nEverybody did.\n“I didn’t know,” Bobbin whispered.\n“Know what?” This was the part, Michel knew, where everyone began"

They threw excuses, tried bribery, swore oaths.\nBut Bobbin knew that, and he didn’t bother. “Fidelis Jes is going to skin\nme alive.”\nThat seems pretty likely. “Know what?” Michel asked again firmly.\n“I didn’t know what they were planning.”\nMichel leaned against the counter and said in a gentle voice, “Tell me\nwhat happened.”\n“I was approached by a lawyer. He used the same brothel as me, over on\nthe Wake. He told me he could pay me a huge sum if I lent him fifteen Iron\nRoses. I thought it was a joke at first. Nobody outside the organization\nknows that I’m the treasurer. But he kept insisting and by the time I decided\nto report him he had bought up all my debts. All of them. From the casinos,\nthe brothels. Even the bookstores. Said he’d cancel all my debts and give\nme half a million if I lent him the Roses for one day. Insisted no one would\neven know they were gone.”\nMichel tilted his head to the side. It was a classic entrapment move, one\nthe Blackhats themselves used when they needed to blackmail someone.\nBobbin should have known better. “And did he give them back?”\n“Yes. He took them from this door right here at nine o’clock at night\nand returned them again by six o’clock the next morning. Once I heard\nabout this thing with the pamphlets, I suspected what had happened. But\nthere was no official word about the Iron Roses having been used so I\nthought maybe it was just a coincidence.”\nA lawyer. The man behind this whole thing. Never mind those fifteen\nmessengers with their Iron Roses. Michel now had the mastermind in his\nsights. Bastard walked right into the Millinery. What a pair of balls. “And\nthere was no one you could ask to find out without implicating yourself?”\nBobbin nodded.\nPit. That was just basic self-preservation. Anyone stupid enough to\nadmit to aiding in the misuse of Iron Roses – no matter how unknowingly –\ndeserved what the Blackhat torturers did to them. Michel looked Bobbin\nover. He was trembling something fierce now, and looked like he might\ncollapse at any moment. But he wasn’t begging, and that was a pleasant\nsurprise.\nMichel hated the begging.\n“I’ve been a wreck ever since,” Bobbin said. “I knew deep down\nsomeone would find out, but I couldn’t have my debts exposed. I would\nhave lost everything.”\n“Out of the pot and into the fire,” Michel said absently. He felt fantastic,\npleased to have made a breakthrough like this in such a short amount of\ntime. He’d solved this thing with the Iron Roses and though he didn’t feel\nrevealing Bobbin was going to earn him his Gold Rose, catching the\nperpetrator behind Bobbin’s blackmail definitely would. This was big. He\neyed Bobbin and made a decision – one he knew he was going to regret.\n“Tell me everything about who you worked for.”\n“I did,” Bobbin said. “It was always the one guy.

Pit, I’d help you track\nhim down right now if I thought it would buy me a reprieve. But he was\nlike a ghost.”\nMichel leaned forward, looking Bobbin in the eye, then nodded. “I do\nbelieve you. Right. Here’s what’s going to happen.” He checked his pocket\nwatch. “Don’t get any funny ideas, because I’ve instructed Warsim to come\ndown and check on me in two or three minutes, and I’ve left evidence of\nyour little lending scheme with someone I trust.”\nBobbin’s brow furrowed. “What are you talking about?”\n“I want you to open that door, punch me really hard in the face, and then\nI never want to see you again.” Michel walked over to the door and stood\npatiently, hand at his sides. “And Bobbin, if they catch up to you, do me a\nfavor and put one in your own head.”\nCHAPTER 14\nA\nt midmorning, Vlora was summoned from her dingy, leaky headquarters\nin the old staff building at Loel’s Fort. She came out to the muster yard\nexpecting a messenger from the Lady Chancellor’s office or one of her own\nscouts but instead found a small Palo man, hat in hand, standing beside a\nrickshaw. The man had a gaunt face and the characteristic ashen freckles\nand fiery red hair of a Palo. There were crow’s feet around his eyes from\ntoo much squinting, and deep smile lines at the corners of his mouth. He\nducked his head as Vlora approached.\n“Lady Flint?” he asked in flawless Adran.\n“That’s me.”\n“Good afternoon. I am Devin-Tallis. I was sent by the Ice Baron.”\nVlora’s mind was elsewhere, churning over supply reports from her\nquartermasters, but she put them all out of her head at the mention of the\npeculiar baron. “Vallencian? What would he… Ah! Did he get me an\ninvitation to the gala? When is that, tonight?”\n“He did, my lady.” Devin-Tallis smiled pleasantly, blinking at Vlora for\nseveral moments.\n“Can I have it?” she asked.\n“Ah, it does not work like that, Lady Flint. I am your invitation.”\nVlora thought she understood immediately. The Depths was closed to\noutsiders. Of course she would need a guide to reach whatever “palace” this\ngala was being held in. She called toward the staff building for Olem, then\nturned back to the Palo. “When is it, exactly? Vallencian didn’t give me any\ndetails.”\n“The baron seldom gives out details that don’t have to do with one of\nhis stories,” Devin-Tallis said, speaking not as if he was a Palo peasant but\nrather a close friend of one of the richest men on the continent. “The"

I’ll\ntake you there and bring you back.”\nVlora looked over her shoulder, wondering where Olem had got himself\nto. “All right, what time do you want to leave?”\n“Eight thirty should be fine. We’re not all that far from the hall.”\n“Why’d you come so early?” Vlora asked.\n“I work on the other side of town. I had a job over here, so I thought it\nseemed prudent. If it is pleasing to your ladyship, I’ll wait here until you’re\nready to depart. I’ll stay out of the way.”\n“Don’t call me that,” Vlora said. “Flint is fine, or General. All right, I’ll\nhave a guard ready by that time. Can horses maneuver through the Depths,\nor should I bring infantry?”\n“Ah,” Devin-Tallis said, clearing his throat, “I’m afraid horses would be\na very bad idea. Besides, the invitation is for one.”\nVlora paused. One? She couldn’t even bring Olem with her? “They\ndon’t have to come inside. They’re for protection. I’ve heard… things\nregarding the safety of the Depths.” She half-expected the Palo to laugh at\nher, but instead his face grew solemn.\n“One,” he said, holding up a finger. “That is all I’m allowed to guide to\nthe Yellow Hall. Lady Flint, or her appointee. No one else. As long as you\nare with me, that is a guarantee of your safety as long as you do not start a\nfight.”\n“Even if I’m provoked?”\n“Dueling is prohibited. You may bring your weapons, because you are a\nsoldier, but if you draw them in anger your safety is revoked.”\n“Who, exactly, guarantees this safety?” Vlora asked. She didn’t like\nanything about the arrangement. It sounded like a trap. Would Vallencian\nset her up?\n“Everyone at the celebration will be a guest of Mama Palo.” Devin-\nTallis’s face darkened slightly. “No one crosses Mama Palo. Should I wait,\nLady Flint? Or have you reconsidered the offer?” He paused, considering,\nthen added in a hushed tone, “Invitations like this are not extended often.\nThe Ice Baron has vouched for you, and that allows you to enter Palo\nsociety this once. If you turn it down, you will not receive another\nopportunity.”\nVlora had heard terms like this before, and it always led to one thing: a\ntrap. Vallencian seemed genuine, and so did the Palo rickshaw driver. But\nshe couldn’t be certain. The implication here was that Mama Palo herself\nhad approved her invitation, which could mean anything at all. She\nsuddenly realized how little she knew of Mama Palo. Was she a malevolent\nforce? Lindet and the Blackhats certainly seemed to think so. Did she\nscheme outside of Greenfire Depths and the Palo that she had united, or did\nshe stay within a small area of influence? Was she the type to dare the ire of\na dangerous mercenary company by harming their general?"

Was she the type to dare the ire of\na dangerous mercenary company by harming their general?\nAs much as the situation made her leery, she felt like she had to take\nadvantage of this. Blackhats didn’t dare the Depths, yet she had been\ninvited right to Mama Palo’s doorstep. Perhaps Mama would even be there\ntonight in the flesh. Kidnapping her on her own would be impossible, but if\nVlora could arrange another, less public meeting…\n“All right,” she said. “Eight thirty. I’ll be here.”\n“Very good, Lady Flint. I’ll wait.”\n“And I’ll send someone out with some water,” Vlora said over her\nshoulder, heading back toward the staff building. She found Olem on the\nother side of headquarters, helping a handful of soldiers pry an immense,\nrotted beam off the inside of the fort walls. The group leaned on a long pry\nbar, heaving and hoeing until the beam came loose in a shower of spongy\nwooden fragments. Olem saw Vlora and came to join her, dusting off his\nhands. “Don’t you have anything better to do?” she asked.\n“Yeah,” Olem said reluctantly. “But they needed an extra body, so I\npitched in. I like to get my hands dirty.”\n“That’s why I like you,” Vlora responded. She smiled at his rolled-up\nsleeves and the sweat on his brow, considering the things she’d like to do to\nhim. But business came first. It always came first. “I just got my invitation\nto the gala.”\nOlem’s face lit up and he gave her a wink. “Excellent! I’ll get my dress\nreds and put together an honor guard.”\n“Yeah,” Vlora said, drawing out the word. “That’s a problem.”\n“How?” Olem asked, immediately suspicious.\n“I’m the only one allowed to go. If I try to bring anyone else, the\ninvitation is forfeit.”\nOlem looked nonplussed. “Well, we’ll have to figure out something\nelse, then.” He paused, examining Vlora’s face, then shook his head. “Oh,\npit. You want to go in there alone, don’t you? Absolutely not, I forbid it.”\n“You what?” Vlora said, her voice growing dangerously quiet. She grit\nher teeth, ready for a fight.\n“I forbid it,” Olem said, though with slightly less conviction. He knew\nhe’d made a mistake.\n“I love you dearly, but you do not forbid me anything,” Vlora said in a\nlow voice. “This is a once-in-a-million chance. I’m being invited straight\ninto the den of our quarry, without a fight, without a risk to the lives of my\nmen.”\n“The adder’s nest, more like it,” Olem spat.\n“Have you known me to fear adders?” Vlora forced herself to rethink\nher anger. Olem wasn’t coddling her. She knew this was a risk she was\ntaking, perhaps foolishly. He was not in the wrong to question it. But she\nwas the commanding officer.\n“No,” Olem answered after a few moments of silence. “I’ve never\nknown you to fear much of anything.”"

It’s a risk I’m willing to take.”\n“At least let me send Norrine or Davd with you.”\nVlora lifted a finger like Devin-Tallis. “One invitation. No more.”\n“Shit,” Olem said, pacing the space between her and the outer wall of\nthe fort. “I wish Styke was here. He said he knows a bit about the Depths. If\nhe was, I could at least have him shadow you.”\n“Well, he’s not. Have you heard from him?”\n“Stopped by earlier. Said he had a lead on those dragonmen. Said he’d\nknow more tonight.”\nVlora stood with her hands on her hips, drumming the butt of her pistol.\nShe wondered if the big bastard was leading them on, or if he really had\nsomething. “All right. I’ll meet with him when I get back. It might not be\nuntil tomorrow. It’s a party, after all.”\nOlem’s jaw tightened in a way she found endearing, and he finally said,\n“All right. Keep your sword loose, and don’t trust anyone.”\n“Of course not.”\n“And,” Olem added, “if anything happens to you, I will burn down\nGreenfire Depths, Lindet and Mama Palo be damned.”\nCHAPTER 15\nM\nichel nursed a decent-sized bruise while Fidelis Jes stood over him,\nreading through his report on Bobbin’s betrayal. Jes gave an occasional\ngrunt or “hmm,” but otherwise fumed silently at the papers in his hands.\nMichel could feel the grand master’s anger almost as strongly as he could\nfeel the throbbing just over his left eye.\n“You’re certain about this?” Jes asked finally, looking up.\nMichel sat up straighter in his seat in the waiting room of the grand\nmaster’s office. He glanced over at Dellina, whose sympathetic smile was\nreassuring but unhelpful, and nodded. “Yes, sir.”\n“Betrayed by our own treasurer,” Jes spat, tossing the report across the\nroom. Papers fluttered to the floor. “And he got away. Dellina, make a note\nto have our people in the port cities of Fatrasta keep an eye out for someone\nmatching Bobbin’s description. We don’t have the time or resources to track\nhim down right now, but we’ll get him eventually.” He looked down at\nMichel, eyes narrowed. “It seems, Agent Bravis, that you’ve exceeded my\nexpectations by tracking down the Roses in just a few days, and then failed\nme by letting the traitor go. All at once. I’m impressed.”\nNot the good kind of impressed, the sardonic voice in the back of\nMichel’s head said. “Sir, I don’t think Bobbin matters much anymore.

He’s the real enemy here,\nand I’d like to request the chance to catch him.” And once I do, you’re\ngoing to forget all about Bobbin and hand me a Gold Rose.\nFidelis Jes’s gaze did not falter. He stared at Michel, annoyed.\n“I got a bit out of Bobbin before he attacked me,” Michel went on. “He\ndidn’t know the name of the man who hired him. But we have a description.\nI can track him down and keep this thing quiet. With Bobbin gone our\nunknown enemy no longer has access to the Millinery.”\n“Unless he wasn’t working alone.”\nMichel swore to himself silently. Bobbin was a loner – the single\ntreasurer down on the bottom floor, always ready to share the office gossip\nbut never really connecting with anyone. It hadn’t even occurred to Michel\nthat he might have an accomplice. “I think he was, sir.” Michel tried to\nsound confident. “I’m fairly good at reading people. He gave me a full\nconfession before he fled. I think he would have named names if there were\nany. He was mortified at his involvement in the scandal.”\n“Yes, you mentioned that in your report,” Jes said sourly. He looked\ndown at the report scattered around the room. “You’re too easy on him,\nAgent Bravis. A traitor is a traitor.”\n“I understand, sir. I won’t be taken by surprise so easily next time.”\nMichel pointed to the bruise. “I’ll have this to remind me to give him what\nfor if I see him.”\nJes snorted and walked into his office. He came out a moment later with\nhis sword, making Michel’s heart leap into his throat. Jes began to work\nthrough a series of thrusts and parries, fighting an invisible opponent, his\nsword sometimes coming within inches of Michel’s face. Michel’s hands\ntrembled but he dared not move.\nHe does this when he’s angry, Dellina mouthed.\nYes, Michel answered silently, but he also murders people to get his\nblood going in the mornings.\nAlmost a full minute passed before Jes set his sword across Dellina’s\ndesk and paced the room, finally turning to Michel with a soldier’s snap and\na more neutral expression on his face. “You’re right,” he said. “Finding\nwhere the Roses came from was your task, and you did manage to do that.\nBut if you think you’ve earned my gratitude, you’re sorely mistaken. You’ll\nhave your chance at redemption. Get this lawyer. Bring him in alive.”\n“Of course, sir.”\nThere was a knock on the door, then it opened a few inches to reveal the\nyoung face of one of the office aides. His eyes widened at the state of the\nantechamber, and Dellina hurried over to speak with him in hushed tones.\nShe conveyed the message to Fidelis Jes, whose eyes narrowed.\n“Well,” Jes said, clearing his throat, “it’s your lucky day, Agent Bravis.”\n“Sir?”\n“A random sweep brought a ruffian in off the street. She’s confessed to\nbeing one of the messengers who used the Iron Roses, and given us a\ndescription of the lawyer matching the same one Bobbin gave you.”"

    "text": "“A random sweep brought a ruffian in off the street. She’s confessed to\nbeing one of the messengers who used the Iron Roses, and given us a\ndescription of the lawyer matching the same one Bobbin gave you.”\nMichel let out a small sigh. This was fantastic news. A corroborating\nreport gave him more credence in Jes’s eyes, and someone else to question.\n“Did she have a name?” he asked hopefully.\n“No,” Dellina responded. “But there was an address.”\nJes picked up his sword and pointed it at Michel, then toward the door.\n“Bring me this troublesome bastard, so I can flay him myself.”\nThe lawyer’s office was in the industrial quarter of Landfall, south of the\nplateau where the foundries and mills worked night and day, fed with raw\ngoods by the keelboats constantly coming down the Hadshaw River. They\nturned out cigars for the Nine, spun wool for Brudanian colonies, canned\nfruit for Gurla, and processed a dozen other goods to ship all over the\nworld.\nSome enterprising landlord had constructed an office building right in\nthe center of it all, renting rooms to the accountants and pencil-pushers who\nkept the surrounding mills running. The address given to Michel by Jes’s\naide was for the second floor, at the very end of the hall. The building\nmanager described the lawyer – once again matching Bobbin’s description\n– and said he never caught the man’s name. His rent was paid in full every\ntwo weeks, in cash.\nMichel left two Iron Roses by the main entrance to the office building\nand another two by the back – he wasn’t letting anyone get the slip on him,\neven if the last time was intentional – then headed up to the second floor\nalone. He wore a nondescript tan suit jacket and matching pants, a flatcap\nheld in one hand, and the collar of his white shirt sharply pressed. He\nwalked up and down the hall of the second floor three times, looking\nthrough the windows of the offices, eyeing the suite at the end.\nThe suite matched the address Michel had been given, but nothing\nseemed out of the ordinary. He reached into his pocket, fingers curling\naround the heavy knuckledusters he kept for special occasions, and knocked\nwith his free hand.\nThere was no answer. He knocked again, then gently put his ear against\nthe door. Nothing but the sound of men comparing ledgers two rooms\nbehind him.\nHe checked the door, finding it unlocked, and pushed his way in,\nadopting his best “clueless busybody” look, and was immediately arrested\nby the sight of a woman frowning at him from behind a secretary’s desk.\nShe was a young, severe-looking woman with her hair pulled into a tight\nbun behind her, a pencil in one hand, and a pile of papers in one corner of\nthe desk.\n“Hello!” Michel said happily in a slightly high-pitched voice he’d\nperfected back during his second stint as an informant. “Good afternoon,\nI’m so sorry… so sorry to barge in here but the door was unlocked.”\nThe woman lifted her chin, her frown deepening. “May I help you, sir?”\nMichel took the address out of his pocket. “Is this… this 214 Canal?”\n“It is,” she replied sharply."

I was told there was a lawyer here. I can’t… I can’t\nremember his name but I was told he was very good and he might be able to\nhelp me.”\n“I think you have the wrong place,” the secretary answered.\n“I don’t… I don’t think so. I double-checked the address. I always…\nalways do. This is a law office, is it not? The landlord said I had the right\nplace.”\nThe secretary looked like she’d sucked on a lemon. “It is,” she\nanswered, “but we don’t practice publicly.”\n“Are you… you sure? Are you the lawyer, ma’am?”\n“I am not. I am the secretary.” She didn’t offer her name.\nMichel looked around the room. It wasn’t large – just a reception area,\nwith a door on the right and a door on the left, meant for a secretary to\nhandle two separate offices. “The owner, is he in? I really must… really\nmust speak to him. It’s most urgent and I was told he could help me.”\n“He is not in.”\nMichel tried to judge whether she was telling the truth, but her obvious\nannoyance could mean anything. He swayed backward, as if he was about\nto step back into the hall, then grabbed for the door on his right, throwing it\nopen. The office was bare, filled entirely with boxes, and not a person in\nsight.\n“Sir!” The secretary leapt to her feet.\nMichel crossed the reception area and opened the other door. Inside was\na desk with nothing but an oil lamp and several more boxes stacked in one\ncorner. There were no other doors or entrances. This was the entire suite.\nThe secretary had been telling the truth. Michel suppressed a frustrated\ngrowl.\nThe secretary snatched him by the arm. “Sir, I am afraid this is quite\nuntoward. You cannot barge in here and —”\nMichel cut her off with a wail. “I’m so sorry, ma’am! I just really need\nto speak with the… with the lawyer right away and I just want to see him\nand it’s my wife and I just don’t know where to turn!”\nThe secretary dragged him bodily toward the door, pushing him out into\nthe hall. “Sir,” she said sternly, straightening her skirt, “I am willing to let\nthis impropriety slide because you are obviously not in your right mind. I\njust don’t know who you think you are looking for, but this is not it. Mr.\nTampo is not in and —”\n“Tampo! Yes, that was his name. I must see him!” Inwardly, Michel\ncheered. He had a name now. And if he had a name, he had a scent. “When\nwill he be in next?”\n“Well, I never… hm. Mr. Tampo may be in tonight. He does not have\nregular office hours but if you come to call around sundown he likes to\nwork when there’s no one else around. I don’t know what you want but I’ll\nlet him deal with you. Now if you will remove your hand, good day, sir!”"

Now if you will remove your hand, good day, sir!”\nShe slammed the door, and Michel barely pulled his fingers out of the way\nin time.\nHe stared at the closed door for several moments, unable to help the\nfeeling of elation. He had a name, he had an address, and he had a time. By\ntomorrow morning he’d have this whole Sins of Empire affair wrapped up,\nbefore the Blackhat propagandists even marched out their scapegoat.\nMichel could practically feel the Gold Rose hanging from his neck.\nCHAPTER 16\nI\nt took Old Man Fles three days to arrange a meeting for Styke. The\ninformation came in the form of a note, telling Styke that someone would\nmeet him at Sender’s Place in order to discuss the dragonmen. The note\ncontained no other information about who, exactly, Styke was supposed to\nmeet. But it would have to be good enough.\nSender’s Place was an old pub on the Rim overlooking Greenfire\nDepths. It was in the basement below a proper gentleman’s club and in\nStyke’s day had been soldier-exclusive – a place where the infantry could\ndrink away the horrors of battle while their officers smoked and played\ncards in their posh velvet couches just upstairs. It all took place under the\nwatchful eye of Grandma Sender, who brooked no fights or pulling of rank.\nTo the veterans of Landfall, it was a damned institution.\nIt wasn’t the type of place anyone would try to start a fight.\nIt was about seven o’clock in the evening and Styke sat on a stoop\nacross the street from the entrance to Sender’s Place, his hands in his\npockets, shoulders hunched and flatcap pulled down to cover his face. It\nseemed, from the look of things, that old Grandma Sender had fallen on\nhard times. The windows of the gentleman’s club upstairs were boarded up,\nthe paint peeling and the front stoop occupied by a beggar and his mutt.\n“I’ve been here before,” Celine told him.\n“Oh yeah?”\n“Yeah, my dad used to fence stuff here.”\n“To Grandma Sender?”\n“No. A man he met in a back room. Grandma was nice, though. Always\ngave me a sweet.”\n“I always liked Grandma Sender,” Styke commented. He was sad to see\nthe ramshackle state of the place, and suspected it was held less sacred than\nit used to be. Oh well. Maybe it hadn’t been the best place to set up a\nmeeting. “All right. You stay out here. You see anyone suspicious head\ntoward the stairs, you throw a pebble at that window there. If there’s more\nthan one, throw more than one pebble. Got it?”\n“Right.”\nStyke headed across the street and put his hand on the iron handrail\nleading to the underground entrance.\n“Ben!” Celine called.\nHe turned back.\n“Be careful.”\nHe nodded and headed down the stairs, ducking into the cool darkness.\nThe pub was just as he remembered it – dimly lit, the faint smell of mala\nsmoke hanging in the air, drunks sleeping off their afternoon hangovers on\nthe corner benches, and old Grandma Sender herself, looking the same as"

Only the\npress of warm bodies and the sound of rowdy drinking songs were missing.\nStyke let his eyes adjust to the dim light. He counted a dozen occupants,\nmost of them drunk or on their way there, only a couple of them having\ndinner. None of them were Palo. He felt a smile tug at the corner of his\nmouth as the smell of the place brought back memories. He’d met Ibana\nhere, more than fifteen years ago. She’d broken his nose, and Grandma\nSender had thrown them both out for the night, so they’d bluffed their way\ninto a card game upstairs and cleaned every krana out of two Kez generals.\n“You just going to stand there eyeing the place or you going to have a\ndrink?” Grandma Sender said, not looking up from her polishing. “Don’t\nthink about robbing us, we got nothing left.”\nStyke went to the bar. “Hard times?” he asked, laying down several\nbanknotes. “Whiskey and a pipe.”\nSender peered at him, scowling. “I know you?” She was a rough old\nwoman, no doubt nearing seventy by now, skin wrinkled, leathery, and pale.\nShe had one eye that seemed to perpetually squint.\n“Doubt it,” Styke said.\nShe shook her head. “Yeah, it’s bad times.” The money disappeared off\nthe bar. “Used to be a veterans’ pub. All the veterans either work down in\nthe mills or been sent to the camps.”\n“No more veterans in Greenfire Depths?” he asked.\n“Some,” Grandma Sender admitted. “But not as many as you’d think.\nTaken over by the Palo these days and that lot is useless as far as I’m\nconcerned. They won’t drink a drop if the owner of the place isn’t a Palo\nthemselves so all I get is the rejects.” She put a full glass in front of Styke,\nthen packed a pipe with cherry-scented tobacco and handed it over. “You a\nveteran?” she asked. “You look familiar.”\n“Just another one of the weary dead, Grandma,” he said. He laid another\nkrana down and nodded to the corner of the bar farthest from the door.\n“Light. Over there.”\nGrandma Sender lit one of the myriad of gas lamps above the spot Styke\nhad indicated and then left him alone with his whiskey and pipe. He\nproduced the morning’s newspaper and sat back with his feet up on a chair.\nThere was a report on the front page about the Riflejack Mercenary\nCompany taking residence in the old Loel’s Fort and getting to work\nrebuilding a few nearby tenements. It would be the closest rebuilding\nproject to Greenfire Depths in years and was stirring up a decent amount of\nsupport from the locals. Styke wondered what Flint was really there for – he\nhadn’t been allowed that far into her good graces – but figured the positive\npress was some kind of red herring. It usually was in Landfall.\nThere was another story about a massive dig site south of the city.\nThousands of laborers had been transported there to help excavate an old"

It usually was in Landfall.\nThere was another story about a massive dig site south of the city.\nThousands of laborers had been transported there to help excavate an old\nmonolith. The site was closed to the public but rumor had it scholars were\nbeing brought in from the Nine. No one really seemed to know what for,\nthough. Seemed like a lot of effort for an old stone.\nStyke flipped through the stories, still pleased by the concept of getting\na newspaper the day it came out instead of waiting weeks or months for it to\nbe smuggled into the labor camps. It was all drivel, of course, but it was\ndrivel about his city.\nHis head came up at the sound of a clink against the high window on the\nother side of the room. There was another clink. Then another. And another.\nStyke drew his knife and laid it on the table, casually setting the newspaper\ndown on top of it, and spread his arms across the back of the bench.\nThe door opened. Even through the dim haze Styke could make out the\npale, freckled skin of a young Palo man, followed by several companions.\nThere were four of them all told, dressed in wool suits like any other city\nfolk, no doubt trying to blend in as well as they could. Even during the war\nmost Palo had stopped wearing their buckskins in the city limits. Too much\nbad blood between them and everybody else.\nThe four Palo fanned out just inside the door. One carried a pistol\nproudly on his hip, two others heavy boz knives like Styke’s – though much\nsmaller – while the fourth was already wearing a pair of iron\nknuckledusters. Came looking for a bit more than talk, it seems. Styke\nlabeled the four of them in his head: Cheeks, Freckles, Soot, and Happy.\nHappy was the one with the pistol on his hip, wearing a big grin and\nlooking around the pub like he planned on owning it by the end of the night.\n“What do you four want?” Grandma Sender demanded. “Ain’t got no\ntime for the likes of you, not if you ain’t drinkin’.”\nHappy gestured rudely. “Shut up, Grandma. Spoke when spoken to, or\nyou’ll get the back of my hand.”\n“Try it, you little runt,” Grandma said, slamming the cup she’d been\npolishing down on the bar. “I’ll…”\n“Grandma,” Styke called gently. “They’re here to see me. Don’t worry\nabout them.” With one foot he pushed the chair across from him out from\nthe table and switched from Adran to Palo. “Sit down and leave the old lady\nalone. We have talking to do.”\n“No fighting!” Grandma Sender warned.\nHappy narrowed his eyes at Styke and swaggered across the room,\nfollowed by the rest. He ignored the offered chair and stood across from\nStyke, arms folded. He wasn’t a small man, as far as most were concerned.\nLean, muscular, taller than average. Like most Palo he had bright green\neyes and a bit of a squint that came from a thousand generations under the\nFatrastan sun. He had the type of face and bearing that would put most"

If only, Styke mused, he had the charm to go with it.\n“You the one who wanted to meet a dragonman?” Happy asked.\n“I am,” Styke said.\n“You don’t look like a historian.”\n“Funny. You don’t look like a dragonman.”\nHappy spat on the floor. “As if a dragonman would bother with the likes\nof you. We’re here to tell you to mind your own damned business. Nobody\n– scholars, historians, or whatever the pit you are – better come looking\naround for a dragonman unless you want your head staved in.”\n“Says who?” Styke asked.\nHappy puffed out his chest. “Says me.”\nStyke eyed Happy’s three companions. They weren’t professionals, but\nthey weren’t fools, either. One of them examined the room, making sure\nStyke didn’t have any backup, while the other two kept their eyes fixed\nfirmly on Styke, their hands ready to move toward weapons. They expected\nto be meeting with some spectacled pipsqueak, but they had come ready for\nanything.\n“Is there a dragonman in Landfall?” Styke asked, trying to sound only\nmildly curious.\n“None of your damned business, you ugly bastard.”\n“Now, now. No need for name calling. I’m just asking questions. Asking\nquestions never hurt nobody.”\n“It’ll get you hurt real quick,” Happy replied. He drew his pistol.\n“We’re here to give you a message and it was supposed to be all gentle-like,\nbut if you’re gonna insist on being inquisitive I can give you a message\nyou’ll remember.”\nStyke sighed. Stupid kids. Too high on their own sense of…\nsomething… to look around them. There wasn’t anyone to impress in this\nlittle place. It was neutral territory where they could have a frank discussion\nin private. Instead of taking a moment to wonder why a single old cripple\nseemed completely at ease being outnumbered four to one, Happy was\nposturing like an idiot.\nIn a slow, deliberate movement, Styke reached into his pocket and drew\nout a roll of krana notes. He peeled off a handful and laid them down on the\ntable. “I’m just curious. Tell me a little bit about this dragonman and you\ncan walk out of here with a pocket full of cash. I’ll go on my merry way\nand nobody gets hurt.”\nHappy glanced over his shoulder at Soot incredulously, then toward a\ndark stall in the opposite corner of the room and back at Styke. “Who the\npit do you think you are?”\n“I’m just looking for a little information. Who’s this dragonman? Why’s\nhe in Landfall now, when they haven’t been seen for decades?” Styke spoke\nquickly to keep Happy on his toes. Five minutes ago he wouldn’t have\nbelieved there was a dragonman in Landfall. But someone had sent these\nfour.\nHappy put one hand on the table and leaned forward, his pistol inches\nfrom Styke’s cheek. “You don’t get to ask questions, ugly. In fact, I think\nI’m going to ask them myself. Why do you want to know? Why do you care"

You better spit it out quick, because I’m losing my\npatience.”\n“You hear what I said?” Grandma Sender demanded from behind the\nbar. “I speak enough of your bullshit language to know you’re getting your\nspirits up. No fighting in here! You five have trouble, take it out to the\nstreet.”\n“Shut up!” Happy yelled. His voice cracked. Something was off here\nand he knew it. Styke wasn’t intimidated by four thugs or a pistol in the\nface, and that just didn’t mesh with Happy’s normal experience.\n“Mind your manners,” Styke snapped. “Answer my questions and you\ncan walk out of here with two hundred krana and all your limbs.”\nHappy’s finger twitched to the trigger of his pistol. “I will take that\nmoney and I’ll shove this pistol up your —”\nStyke snatched up his knife and bolted Happy’s wrist to the table with\nthe blade. “Never reach for the money first,” he said, jerking the pistol out\nof Happy’s hand.\nHappy and his cohorts stared at the blade sticking out of Happy’s wrist\nfor several long seconds, then Happy began to scream. There was a mad\nscramble as the other three went for their weapons, and above it all Styke\ncould hear Grandma Sender yelling, “No fighting, no fighting!”\nStyke threw the table – and Happy along with it – at Soot. They both\nwent down in a pile of limbs while the other two Palo leapt for Styke. He\ncame off his bench and sidestepped a knife thrust from Cheeks, dropping\nthe Palo with a punch to the temple.\nFreckles managed to coldcock Styke in the jaw with the knuckledusters.\nStyke shook off the pain and leaned into another punch to his stomach. He\ngrunted, then caught Freckles’s arm and twisted hard. The sound of\nsnapping bone was followed by Freckles’s scream.\nCheeks recovered from Styke’s punch and barreled back into the fight\nknife-first. Styke sidestepped the thrust and wrapped one arm around\nCheeks’s waist, pulling him close like a woman at a dance, and slammed his\nforehead against Cheeks’s nose. The Palo slumped to the ground.\nStyke strode over to where Soot and Happy were still caught under the\nheavy table. He righted it, then jerked his knife out of Happy’s wrist. Soot\nscrambled toward his own knife, but Styke stepped on his arm. He leaned\nover Soot, taking him by the throat, and squeezed till he felt blood. Soot\ntwitched several times and then was still, and Styke had to wipe the blood\noff his ring so it wouldn’t slip from his finger.\nThe whole fight had taken less than twenty seconds, and Happy’s face\nwas frozen in terror as he crawled through a smear of his own blood,\ncradling his wrist, trying to reach the pistol Styke had taken from him.\nBehind them, Grandma Sender screamed obscenities at them all. Styke\npicked the pistol up and checked the pan. “It’s not even loaded, you\nasshole.” He raised his knife."

I’m not the one you want.\nHe is!” He thrust his finger toward a dark corner of the room. Styke\nhesitated, suspecting a trick. There was nobody in that corner.\nThe hairs on the back of Styke’s neck suddenly stood on end as the very\nshadows themselves seemed to move. A man stood up, appearing as if he\nhad emerged from nothing, adjusting the cuffs of his fine black suit. He was\nsquat and muscular, with short, fire-red hair and a tuft of beard on his chin.\nBlack tattoos snaked onto his wrists and neck but otherwise he might have\nbeen mistaken for a Palo businessman having a drink in the pub.\nGrandma Sender, her arms thrown up over the mess of bodies on her\nfloor, paused mid-tirade. “Where the pit did you come from?”\nThe stranger ignored her. “Why do you want a dragonman?” he asked.\nThe words were strangely thick, like he had a mouth full of molasses, and it\ntook several moments for Styke to realize why. He wasn’t speaking Palo.\nHe was speaking a sister language, one so close they could be mistaken\nfor the same; Dynize.\nStyke forgot Happy on the floor beneath him. A killer knew a killer at\nfirst glance, and this one had a lot of blood on his hands. He held himself\nconfidently, head slightly cocked, his body relaxed but his attitude\nscreaming imminent violence. Styke turned toward this stranger – a\ndragonman – and held his knife out to his side.\n“Just looking for answers.”\n“Well,” the dragonman said. “You won’t find them. Not here.”\nStyke had always been good at assessing a threat. He knew when to\npush and when to retreat and it had made him an unbeatable cavalry\ncommander. But he couldn’t read the dragonman at all, and that was\ndisconcerting. “I think I will. Might have to pry them out of you, though.”\nHe gestured to the bodies of the Palo kids he’d just torn through. “These are\nyours, aren’t they? Didn’t even step in to give them a hand.”\nThe dragonman’s eyebrow twitched slightly, an arrogant tic that said it\ndidn’t matter much.\nStyke felt a little bile in the back of his throat. These poor Palo kids\nwere probably acolytes of some kind. In Styke’s mind, that made the\ndragonman responsible, just like Colonel Styke had been responsible for\nevery lancer under his command. “I don’t like you,” Styke said. “And I\nthink I’m going to enjoy killing you.”\nThe dragonman took a step forward, then stopped. His face reminded\nStyke of a cat, completely unreadable, eyes searching Styke for strengths\nand weaknesses. He seemed to hesitate and then, without warning, he\nsuddenly went for the door, as quick and casual as a panther who’d decided\nnot to fight a bear for its kill.

By the time he reached the street, the dragonman\nwas already disappearing into the late afternoon crowd.\n“Celine!” Styke jammed a new piece of horngum in his mouth, chewing\nviolently to numb the spasm in his leg.\nShe joined him quickly, and Styke pointed after the dragonman. “Did\nyou just see the Palo that came out of the door? The one in the black suit?”\n“Yes.”\n“Follow him. Don’t let him see you, but don’t lose him. I’ll be right\nbehind you.”\nCeline took off into the crowd and Styke fell back, following at a\nleisurely pace. He wiped blood off his sleeve and face, grumbling under his\nbreath. He didn’t like being duped, or given the slip like that. He also didn’t\nlike getting answers that raised more questions.\nLike what the pit a legend like a Dynize dragonman was doing alive and\nwalking around in Landfall.\nCHAPTER 17\nV\nlora wore her dress uniform, sword and pistol at her belt, and met\nDevin-Tallis in the muster yard at eight thirty. It wasn’t long until dark,\nand she boarded his tiny rickshaw with some trepidation. He immediately\nset off from Loel’s Fort, heading down the street and toward the\nswitchbacks that Michel had taken her down just two days earlier. By the\ntime they reached the bottom all sign of daylight was gone, and she was\nsurprised to see the narrow streets lit dimly by a handful of gas lamps she\nhad not noticed earlier.\nWithin moments of reaching the floor of the Depths she was completely\nturned around. Devin-Tallis chugged onward, his legs working effortlessly\nas he pulled the rickshaw through a series of rapid, seemingly unnecessary\nturns, his feet splashing through the permanent layer of damp sludge that\nseemed to cover the streets. They traveled onward in silence for several\nminutes, and Vlora’s heart beat a little faster with every passing moment\nand the realization that if Devin-Tallis left her suddenly, she had no hope of\nfinding her way back to the plateau on her own.\nShe unwrapped a powder charge and sprinkled a bit on her tongue,\nrelishing the sulfur taste, then snorting a bit more. The trance lit her mind\nlike a fuse, letting her focus better, her vision sharpening so that she could\nsee the dark spots between gas lamps as clear as if it were day.\nBeing able to see the sudden sharp angles and dubious construction of\nthe overlapping tenements did very little to calm her. “You said this is a\ncelebration,” she said. “But Vallencian called it a gala. Which is it?”\nDevin-Tallis spoke without turning his head. “Both, I suppose. It’s a\nPalo celebration, the Day of the Two Moons.”\nVlora tried to think of a festival that corresponded to today’s date, but\nno harvests or astrological events came to mind. “What does that mean?”\n“No idea,” Devin-Tallis said. “I asked my father when I was a boy. He\ndidn’t know, either. It’s a festival, and we celebrate.”\n“Usually a festival corresponds to something.”"

Vlora looked up, trying to get her bearings from\nthe sky, but even the little slices of fading twilight that she had been able to\nsee through the jumbled tenements were now gone, obscured by the\nmasonry, boards, and cloth that stitched together the layers of Greenfire\nDepths. She took a little more powder to calm her nerves. “What kind of a\nname is Devin-Tallis?”\n“A Palo one,” he answered.\n“I haven’t met many Palo with two names.”\n“It’s not actually two names,” Devin-Tallis said. “Devin is my title. My\ngiven name is Tallis.”\n“No family name?”\n“Some of us have them. It varies among the tribes.

We go by our title, and\nthen our name.”\nVlora thought of the way Kressian naming conventions went. The lower\nclasses often only had a single name. They could buy or earn a second name\n– often an epithet like her “Lady Flint.” Now that she thought of it, their\nmethods were not dissimilar. “What does Devin mean?”\n“One who serves.”\n“Is that a class thing, or…”\n“Ah, no,” Devin-Tallis said. “I pull a rickshaw, and I have since I was\nstrong enough. It makes me good money, and allows me to keep a family.\nOne who serves is a proud name. You might call it middle-class.”\nVlora couldn’t help but chuckle. So often it was easy to think of the\nPalo as savages – most Kressians did – but then she was reminded that most\nspoke Adran or Kez or some other Kressian language with little accent, and\nthey grasped Kressian traditions better than Kressians grasped theirs. She\nwondered, if the Palo were not so divided, whether they would have any\ntrouble pushing the Kressian immigrants into the sea.\nIt was most likely a possibility that haunted Lady Chancellor Lindet’s\ndreams.\nVlora remembered someone she’d once known – the green-eyed girl\nTaniel brought back from his time in Fatrasta all those years ago, along with\nrumors of a scandal that had caused her no end of grief. “What does ‘Ka’\nmean?” she asked.\nDevin-Tallis slowed slightly, frowning over his shoulder. “I have not\nheard that before. I would have to ask. Ah, we are here.” They rounded a\ncorner and came to a sudden stop. Vlora glanced around. Nothing seemed\nout of the ordinary. There were no crowds, no arrival line of rickshaws. Just\nanother side alley with a well-trodden street of stone and muck, ending in a\nwell-lit door made of reeds.\n“We’re here?” Vlora asked.\n“Yes.”\n“You’re sure?”\n“This is it,” Devin-Tallis said. “The streets down here are narrow, so"

The Palo don’t care much for\ngrand facades. It is, after all, what is inside that matters.”\nVlora got out of the rickshaw and Devin-Tallis put it off to one corner,\nthen led her to the door at the end of the alley and spoke his name. The reed\ncurtain was pulled aside, revealing a narrow corridor and a pair of armed\nPalo. Vlora could smell the powder on them, and spotted their pistols a\nmoment later. They gazed back at her stoically, and Vlora spread her senses,\ntrying not to gasp when she felt hundreds of small caches of powder within\nfifty yards, each of them no doubt representing another armed guard.\nSecurity, it seemed, was not a problem for the Palo.\nDevin-Tallis waved her forward. “I will introduce you,” he said, leading\nher down several narrow corridors, “and then I must return to my\nrickshaw.”\n“You’re not coming in?”\n“I am,” Devin-Tallis said with a smile, “middle-class. The Palo have\ntheir own system, and only the elite are invited into the Yellow Hall. Ah.\nHere we are. I will come back and check on you in a few hours. If you wish\nto leave, simply send someone to find me.”\nVlora had become increasingly aware of the low buzz of conversation at\nthe edges of her powder trance, but a wave of voices suddenly burst upon\nher as if she’d entered a banquet hall. They passed two more guards in the\ngaslit corridor and then Devin-Tallis opened a heavy wooden door for her.\nWhat she saw nearly made her gasp.\nThey stood at the top of three steps leading down into an enormous\nroom, easily a hundred paces across, with dozens of nooks and crannies.\nChandeliers hung from the ceiling, and there were hallways and balconies\nabove them that implied the building was much larger than this one hall.\nLight came from gas lanterns; food and drink, including wine and iced\ncoffee and tea, were provided by smartly dressed servants. The walls and\nfloor were made of the same dark yellow limestone from which the capitol\nbuilding had been constructed, though the architecture here looked much\nolder.\nGuests filled the entire hall, dancing, speaking, lounging on couches\nalong the walls. She had expected a sea of freckled faces with bright red\nhair, but instead found that only about half the people in the room were\nPalo. The others were Kressians from a variety of backgrounds, from white\nAdrans and Kez, to dusty Rosveleans, to black-skinned Deliv, and they all\nseemed to mingle freely.\n“Welcome,” Devin-Tallis said, “to the Yellow Hall.”\nMichel spent all day setting his trap. The grand master’s office lent him Iron\nRoses to cover the entrance to the office building, to watch the windows,\nthe back door, and the street.

He had men follow the secretary home –\nwhich turned out to be just a few blocks away on the edge of the industrial\nquarter – and positioned people outside her door. This was his chance at\nwrapping up this investigation in just a few days. It would get him his Gold\nRose.\nHe was not going to fail.\nIt was almost nine when Agent Warsim, Michel’s sometime partner,\nscurried across the street and joined Michel in his hiding place beneath the\nshadow of a nearby factory. Warsim wore his Bronze Rose and carried a\npistol and truncheon. “The boys think they’ve spotted Tampo,” he said in a\nlow whisper.\nMichel bit nervously at his nails, eyes on the street, and headed out into\nthe waning sunlight. He arrived a half a block from the office building in\ntime to see a man in a sharp black suit and top hat, carrying a silver cane\nunder one arm and an attaché case under the other, slip in the entrance.\nMichel looked up and down the road, making fists to keep his hands\nfrom trembling. Pit, this was it. Tampo wasn’t going to escape. He let\nhimself inside and ascended the staircase, followed by Warsim and three\nIron Roses. The building was quiet, most of the offices empty, and on the\nsecond floor there wasn’t a single lantern lit except for the flicker of light\ncoming from underneath the door of the suite at the end of the hall.\n“Give me your pistol,” Michel said, taking the weapon from Warsim.\nThe five of them crept down the hall, careful not to make any noise, and\ncame up against the suite door. He listened for a moment, then nodded to\nthe biggest of the Iron Roses. “Open the door!”\nStyke followed the dragonman through the city for almost two hours. He\nhung back – far back – so as not to draw attention, keeping his shoulders\nhunched and his hat pulled low. It was hard to follow anyone for a man of\nhis size, but he kept Celine as a lifeline. She had her eyes on the\ndragonman, and Styke had his eyes on her.\nThe dragonman ranged all over. His path seemed random at first, and\nStyke was worried he knew he was being followed, but it soon became\napparent that the dragonman was meeting with people. He stopped by a\nbrothel in the industrial quarter, spent an hour in the Treasury building in\nUpper Landfall, then went down to the docks, where he visited three\ndifferent ships in the course of fifteen minutes.\nStyke got more than one good look at the dragonman in the light of day,\nand he was more convinced than ever that he was a Dynize. The Dynize\nwere related closely to the Palo, both in looks and language, but there were\nsubtle markers that someone with a good eye – and enough historical\neducation – could see right away. The dragonman’s eyes were slightly more\noval, his cheeks a bit too gaunt, and his ears were pierced at the top of the\near instead of the lobe.\nThe mystery became to Styke not that the dragonman was a Dynize, but\nrather why he was a Dynize.

    "text": "rather why he was a Dynize. Even before Styke’s time at the labor camp the\nDynize had been isolationists, the borders of their continent closed to\noutsiders – including merchants and missionaries. No one had seen them\nanywhere outside their country for more than a hundred years, even though\nFatrasta lay practically on the Dynize doorstep. What were they doing here\nnow?\nStyke didn’t even know the Dynize had dragonmen. The stories said the\nPalo developed their own warriors after the Dynize pulled out of Fatrasta. It\nseemed, though, based on the tattoos, that they’d taken their dragonmen\nstraight from Dynize society. Which meant that the Dynize might have a\nwhole nation’s worth of dragonmen, and even if they were one in ten\nthousand, the prospect of an army of mythical warriors was… off-putting.\nBut all that seemed like a pretty huge assumption. Styke needed to stop\ngetting ahead of himself and get the drop on the dragonman. It would be\nbest to take him alive, but even tossing a dead body at the feet of Lady Flint\nwould answer some questions. At the very least it would get her to trust\nhim, which, Styke reminded himself, was his primary mission.\nStyke pulled his head out of his own thoughts for a moment, looking\naround for Celine. He’d lost her a few times, but she wasn’t hard to spot in\nher yellow shirt and boy’s trousers. She kept well ahead of him and he\ndidn’t begin to worry until he’d gone almost a full block and saw no sign of\nher anywhere.\nThey were still down in the docks. This area was packed with\nwarehouses and silos, half of them on the boardwalk, forming a myriad of\nalleys and switchbacks. It wasn’t the ideal place to follow someone.\nBut it was a great place for an ambush.\nStyke felt his heart beating a little faster. Celine would have called out if\nshe ran into trouble, wouldn’t she? She was a smart girl, more than quick\nenough to get away from most adults. But this was a dragonman, a killer as\nbloody and remorseless as Styke himself.\nHe found himself doubling his pace, head whipping back and forth as he\nrushed past alleys, looking for any sign of Celine. He kept one hand out in\nfront of him, pushing dockworkers and sailors out of the way, the other\nhand on the hilt of his knife. She was here somewhere, he knew it, and he’d\nfind her.\n“Ben!”\nStyke only needed to hear the sound once. He about-faced, backtracking\nthrough the evening traffic, even shoving a pack mule bodily from his path,\nhis mind racing. His name had been yelled in desperation.\nHe checked the face of an alleyway and came up short.\nThe dragonman stood less than twenty paces away. His head was\ncocked, an expression of annoyance on his face, and he held a squirming\nCeline by the back of the neck. In his other hand was a polished bone knife,\ncurved and wicked like a ceremonial dagger.\nStyke felt his chest tighten at the sight of Celine. The dragonman was\nclearly hurting her, and he clearly didn’t care.\n“Ben, was it?” the dragonman asked casually. “You’re going to answer\nsome questions.”"

He ran a\nhand over his mouth, trying to keep the enormous grin off his face.\nHe was a professional, after all.\nHe counted to ten seconds, then followed the Iron Roses inside suite\n214, looking around. Tampo was in the office on the left, sitting behind the\ndesk with Agent Warsim behind him. Tampo’s jacket was pulled halfway\ndown, trapping his arms so he couldn’t move. Tampo would be feeling\nmore than a little terror right now, and Michel was willing to let that last\nanother couple of moments.\nHe did a quick circuit of the opposite room, using a knife to pry open\none of the many crates that were stacked haphazardly around. He blinked\ndown at the contents, frowning, before that big grin he’d been trying to\nsuppress finally broke through his defenses. “Bring me that lantern.”\nOne of the Iron Roses brought him the lantern from Tampo’s desk.\nMichel held it over the crate, light spilling across the contents, to reveal\nstacks of Sins of Empire. With so many crates in this room and the next,\nthere were probably thousands of copies here. There was now no doubt this\nwas the man who’d arranged the printing of the pamphlet.\nAnd Michel had him at gunpoint in the other room.\nHe suppressed the urge to dance over to Tampo’s desk and instead\nwalked, measuring his steps. He set down the lantern and leaned forward,\ngazing into Tampo’s eyes. The lawyer was frozen in terror, his mouth\nworking but nothing coming out. The trousers of his fine suit were soaked\nwith urine. Sedition against the Lady Chancellor wasn’t so clever now, was\nit? Michel found himself unsure of where to start. Was he supposed to\nquestion him? Take him straight to the Millinery?\n“Looks like we’re both in for a long night,” Michel said, sitting on the\nedge of the desk. “Tell me, is your real name Tampo? Because I couldn’t\nfind it in any of the public records, and I had people searching all\nafternoon.”\nThe lawyer’s mouth continued to work. Michel frowned. He’d expected\nsomeone timid – revolutionaries often were once you took the piss out of\nthem – but he hadn’t expected someone so frozen by their own terror that\nthey couldn’t speak. He must realize how close to the end of his life he had\ncome. Michel didn’t particularly relish what was going to happen to Tampo.\nHe didn’t like torture, though it certainly had its uses, but he was\nexceedingly pleased to be the one to bring Tampo down. It was going to\nearn him his Gold Rose.\nHe leaned forward, smacking Tampo on the cheek gently. “Have\nanything to say?”\nTampo’s jaw trembled, and he whispered something between his\nchattering teeth. Michel leaned forward to better hear it. “Speak up.”"

Michel leaned forward to better hear it. “Speak up.”\n“I don’t know who you think I am,” the man said. “But I’m the janitor.”\nAll the joy Michel had been floating on disappeared. This couldn’t have\nbeen a mistake. Janitors didn’t wear five-thousand-krana suits. They didn’t\ncarry canes. “Excuse me?”\n“The lawyer who works here said he’d give me a hundred krana to\ncome in tonight wearing his clothes.”\nMichel licked his lips. He snatched up the man’s right hand, examining\nhis fingers closely. They weren’t the fingers of a lawyer. They were rough,\nburned, and blistered from years of manual labor, paint on his knuckles and\ndirt under his nails.\nThis was not Tampo.\n“Son of a bitch!” Michel kicked over one of the crates, pointing at one\nof the Iron Roses. “Go get me the secretary. Now!”\nCHAPTER 18\n“T\nhe Lady Vlora Flint,” Devin-Tallis announced loudly, as if he were a\nherald at a king’s ball. He gave a half bow and withdrew, leaving\nVlora at the top step, looking out over the array of faces that turned to look\nat her.\nThe normal conversation stopped, and the quiet buzz of whispered\ngossip replaced it. She could make out any of them if she focused, thanks to\nher powder trance, but she decided she’d rather not know what they had to\nsay. Some faces seemed welcoming, others openly hostile, while even more\nwere perplexed. Vlora resisted the urge to check the cuffs of her uniform\nand polish the crossed muskets of her brass Riflejack pin.\n“Ah!” a voice boomed from nearby. “Lady Flint, my friend.” Vallencian\nmoved through the crowd like a bull through a herd of sheep, coming over\nand taking her by the arm and leading her down into the mingling guests,\nand to her relief the regular conversation immediately resumed. “I am so\nglad you took me up on the invitation,” Vallencian said. “I know you\nmilitary types. Don’t like a place without a clear exit. But I tell you, it’s\nworth it!”\n“Thank you for arranging an invitation for me,” Vlora said, ignoring the\nirony as she checked for exits and reached out with her senses to spot the\nguards. She passed familiar faces, though none with names she could\nremember, and caught more than one Palo staring at her. “I’m wondering,”\nshe confessed, “if this was such a good idea.”\n“It’s fine,” Vallencian declared. “Lady Flint has no need of an honor\nguard. You are an honor guard.”\n“I’m not sure what that means, but I’m beginning to think the biography\nyou read of me may have greatly exaggerated my accomplishments,” Vlora\nsaid. “I’m just a soldier.” Which seemed an understatement right now. She\nhad never liked this sort of crowd. Politicians always rubbed her the wrong\nway – one of the reasons she’d left Adro despite being a decorated general –\nand places like this were breeding grounds for the worst kind of petty\npolitics. This had been a very bad idea indeed. “What is this place?”"

Built by the quarry foreman back when the quarries\nhere provided all the wealth in Landfall.”\n“It looks old.”\n“A hundred and fifteen years, I think. It’s held up remarkably well for\nbeing buried underneath a dozen tenements. The yellow limestone is no\nfacade – solid blocks.” He led them near one of the walls and slapped it\nwith one hand as if to demonstrate.\nA whole villa, buried down here in the center of the Depths, long\nforgotten by the rest of Landfall. Surely the Blackhats must know about this\nplace? “I thought there would be more Palo.”\nVallencian led her through the press, past a table where he nabbed a\nglass of iced coffee and pushed it into her hands, and then toward the far\ncorner. “Yes, yes. Usually more Palo, but it’s a public celebration – as\npublic as the Palo get – so they’ve invited everyone who does business\ndown here.” He pointed to a young woman in a sheer dress. “That is Lady\nEnna, she owns the biggest quarry in Greenfire Depths along with the Palo\nnext to her, Meln-Dun. That old man with the glasses, that is Rider Hofflast.\nOwns ten thousand acres of sugarcane on an island off the coast, employs\nmostly Palo. There is a man who sells the lumber, a woman who trades furs.\nEveryone here does business with the Palo.”\nShe wondered how so many Kressians could be down here, doing open\nbusiness, while the Blackhats feared stepping foot in the Depths. It seemed\npreposterous and she wanted to ask Vallencian but it was a question she\ndidn’t want overheard. “I thought Lindet owned most of the businesses in\nLandfall.”\nVallencian snorted. “She likes to think she does and,” he said with a\nshrug, “she has a piece of every company in Fatrasta. It’s the cost of doing\nbusiness. Don’t get me wrong, I respect Lindet. She’s a smart, driven\nwoman, even if she’s as savage as a high-mountain bear. But she’s\noverextended, and just one woman.”\n“You respect her?” Vlora echoed, looking around to see who might have\noverheard. This seemed poor company for such an utterance.\n“Of course,” Vallencian responded. “I never said I liked her. But she’s a\npowerful, driven woman. There is a lot to admire.”\nVlora glanced up at Vallencian. She found she was growing to like him\nmore and more. “Even after the way she treats your… business partners?”\n“I see the good in people,” Vallencian said, matter-of-factly. “Even\nwhen it’s hard to find.”\n“You see too much of the good in people,” a voice suddenly said\nsharply. Vlora turned to find the woman in the diaphanous dress, Lady\nEnna, standing at her shoulder. Enna seemed just a little younger than she,\nwell-endowed with long, brown hair and lips that most courtesans would\nkill for. She took Vlora’s other arm, unasked, and leaned in conspiratorially."

She took Vlora’s other arm, unasked, and leaned in conspiratorially.\n“Lady Flint, I am Lady Enna and I am absolutely honored to meet you.”\n“Thank you,” Vlora said, giving her a tight smile. Enna’s eyes were just\na little too big, her expression just a little too forward, in a way that struck\nVlora as artificial. Vlora opened her mouth to ask Vallencian a question, but\nthe Ice Baron suddenly disengaged with an apology and disappeared into\nthe crowd, leaving Vlora alone with Lady Enna.\nThe bastard.\nBefore Vlora could say a word, Enna leaned even closer. “Don’t think\nI’m being too hard on Vallencian. We all love him to death, but he is a big\nstuffed bear, the mighty fool. He’s too soft on Lindet and her blasted\nBlackhats. She is a terror and she must be stopped.”\nVlora raised her eyebrows, startled to hear such a declaration. Was it\nthat kind of party, full of dogmatic liberals? Or had Lady Enna had too\nmuch to drink? Vlora could smell the wine on her breath. She was tempted\nto say, You know I work for her, right? But she managed to keep her lips\nsealed. “I, uh… Do many other people feel the same way?”\n“There are thousands of us,” Enna assured. “Have you heard of the New\nFatrasta movement?”\n“I’m sure I have,” Vlora said, though she definitely hadn’t.\n“Well, let me tell you, the New Fatrasta movement aims to put Lindet\nout of power, and to disband her group of legalized thugs.” She leaned so\nclose her head was practically on Vlora’s shoulder. “Did you see the\npamphlet that came out last week? Sins of Empire? Well, I have it on good\nauthority that it was a high-ranking member of the New Fatrasta movement.\nThere’s whispers it was even the Red Hand. Wouldn’t that be exciting?”\nVlora had dealt with agents of the Red Hand out on the frontier.\n“Exciting” was one word for it, but not one she would have chosen. He was\none of the more effective Palo revolutionaries operating out of the wilds,\nand rumor had it his small guerrilla army drove Lindet to distraction. “This\nNew Fatrasta, is it an organized thing?” she asked.\n“Oh, no. We’re not organized.”\nDoubtlessly.\n“I’m sure you have a copy, but here, take this,” Enna said. She paused\nto search her handbag until she found the pamphlet, thrusting it in Vlora’s\nhands. It wasn’t large, maybe ten or twelve pages, and when she turned it\nover the title Sins of Empire was printed on the front. “If you have not read\nit, you must immediately. It is an exposé on everything Lindet has done to\nthis poor, helpless country. It tells us how her greedy, landgrabbing ways\nhave destroyed the Palo people and raped Fatrasta’s heritage.

It speaks of\nthe revolutions in Fatrasta and Adro and the changes that came from the\nKez Civil War as a starting point to a whole new world that is led by the\ncommon people, for the common people.”\nVlora opened her mouth several times through the tirade, but couldn’t\nget a word in edgewise. She’d heard of this pamphlet – copies were given\nout all over Landfall the last couple of days, despite the Blackhats’ efforts to\ncensure them. It was a fascinating read with a few radical, naive ideas but a\ncentral premise that she basically agreed with. But as a necessity she kept\nher politics quiet, and out of her business. Politics had been the forte of\nField Marshal Tamas, her mentor, a skill that had not rubbed off on her.\nBesides, mercenary generals didn’t always get to choose who they worked\nfor when their men had to be paid.\nWhich meant that, as a point, she refused to get pulled into political\ndiscussions. Especially with inebriated, well-meaning acolytes. “It\nsounds… interesting,” she said, handing the pamphlet back.\n“Keep it,” Enna declared. “It will open your mind in ways you Will.\nNot. Believe. Say the word and I can get you more literature. As I said there\nare thousands of us, and though Lindet thinks she has the upper hand, the\nwriters in this beleaguered city continue to work, churning out new\nmanifestos every day that make me wonder why the world has not risen up\nto throw off their shackles.”\nDefinitely drunk, Vlora decided. No one in their right mind shared this\nmuch politics in a city where such a thing could get you hanged, or worse.\n“You know,” Vlora said, “it has been done.”\nEnna’s eyes grew somehow larger. “It has?”\n“Yes. That revolution in Adro. I was in it. We killed several hundred\nnoble families and the king, sparking a war that ended over a million lives.”\nAnd wound up with more than one dead god.\n“That’s right! It must have been glorious,” Enna breathed.\n“The Adran Coup was the most well-organized revolution in history,\nand even that turned into a shit show,” Vlora said bluntly, immediately\nfrustrated that she’d allowed her anger to seep through. Her involvement in\nthe Adran Coup and the Kez Civil War had, she’d found, made her a bit of a\ncelebrity among radical leftists. Which made her more than a little\nuncomfortable. “You don’t want to live through a revolution,” she added.\n“If you do survive to the end, half the people you’ve ever loved will be\ndead.”\n“Well,” Enna said, her demeanor turning prickly, “you must break your\nomelet to use your eggs.”\nVlora squinted at her. “What?”\n“I think,” a man said, slipping up beside Enna, “that she means you\nmust break some eggs to make an omelet.”\n“Yes!” Enna exclaimed. “That’s it!”\n“Lady Enna, I think you should sit down,” the stranger said. “Here, give\nme your arm, and come over here and speak with Vallencian.

He has so\nmissed your company.” The man took Enna by the hand, leading her away,\nand returned a moment later with a rueful smile. He was tall, around\nVallencian’s height, but with the lean body of a duelist. He wore an\nexpensive black suit, silver-headed cane under his arm, and had blue eyes\nthat seemed to smile about something only he knew. He had no trace of an\naccent, suggesting he had grown up in Adro. He offered his hand.\n“Gregious Tampo,” he said. “Esquire. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Lady\nFlint.”\nVlora immediately felt something off about the man. A sixth sense made\nthe hair on the back of her neck stand on end, and she half-expected his\nhands to be clammy and cold. She shook his hand. “You look familiar.”\n“We’ve never met,” Tampo assured. “Though I’m told I have a soldier’s\nface.”\n“You’re a lawyer?” She studied his face. She’d seen it before, she was\ncertain, and her first instinct was to try to remember any wanted posters\nshe’d seen in local police stations. She opened her third eye, looking for any\nsign of sorcery about the man, but found nothing.\n“I was a soldier, actually. Served in the dragoons during the Fatrastan\nRevolution. Lawyer now, though, that’s true.”\nVlora tried to ignore her initial misgivings. He seemed polite enough.\nAnd a fellow soldier, too. “Vallencian told me all the Kressians down here\nhave business in the Depths. I assume yours is law?”\n“I dabble in some politics.

It said “The Palo Herald” on\nthe front. There was no name or address printed on the back. “It’s nothing\ntoo active. Just something to give the Palo people to help them keep up on\nnews that matters to them.”\nVlora froze, feeling as if she’d just been caught in some sort of trap.\n“What kind of news?” Tampo seemed just a little too comfortable; a little\ntoo pleased with himself.\n“Oh,” Tampo said pleasantly. “Everything we get our hands on.\nIntertribal politics, government policy, that sort of thing.” He readjusted his\ncane, snatching a glass of iced tea from a passing servant and downing half\nof it in one go. “Sometimes we run stories about mercenary companies that\nhave been putting down Palo revolts.”\nVlora considered her words carefully, but all she could come up with\nwas a high-pitched “hmm,” followed by taking a sip from her own glass.\nShe cleared her throat. “Are you a reporter, too, Mr. Tampo?”\n“I am not,” he said with a condescending smile. “Though my reporters\nhave written several very detailed articles about you.”\n“And you wanted to meet me why?”\n“Because the articles they write are fascinating. Something about you"

Something about you\nhas the attention of my reporters. You’ve become a character study.”\n“I can’t imagine you know enough about me to create a character\nstudy,” Vlora said. She glanced around for Vallencian, hoping to make a\npolite escape from this conversation, but could not spot him.\n“You’d be surprised,” Tampo said. “Reporters dig up an awful lot. And\nthey like to use it to paint a story. Tell me, were you really engaged to\nTaniel Two-shot?”\nVlora’s stomach clenched. That was ancient history, more than a decade\nold and across the ocean. Yet it always seemed to rear its ugly head. “I\nwas,” she said coldly.\n“Now, correct me if I’m wrong, but he broke off the engagement, did he\nnot? Because he found you in the bed of another man?”\nVlora’s fingers tightened on the hilt of her sword without having\ncommanded her hand to move there, and she had to fight down the urge to\nrun Tampo through without warning. She’d expected a conflict of some\nkind tonight – perhaps a confrontation with a Palo who knew someone her\nmen had killed – but certainly not with a fellow Adran. “That one, childish\ndecision ruined my life,” Vlora said softly, “and I have spent the last decade\nputting it together. If you would like to step outside, I will kill you.”\n“No dueling, I’m afraid,” Tampo said with a smug smile. “Mama Palo\nfrowns upon it, and this is her residence. But you mistake my meaning. I’m\nnot trying to twist the knife. I’m trying to help you understand something.”\n“What, exactly, is that?”\nTampo pointed at her chest. “Taniel Two-shot was a war hero in Fatrasta\neven before he became a war hero in his native Adro. He helped us win our\nWar for Independence and he was a friend to the Palo. And now the woman\nwho spurned him less than a year before his heroic death is here in Fatrasta\nputting down Palo revolts in the very location he tried to help both\nFatrastans and Palo alike earn their freedom from the Kez. That, Lady Flint,\nmakes you an absolutely perfect villain to my reporters.”\n“You think I’m a villain?” Vlora asked flatly. She’d been called far\nworse, but for some reason the accusation stung. She, a veteran fighter, a\nrevolutionary by most standards, was an enemy? The very idea made her\nsick to her stomach.\n“I don’t write the narratives,” Tampo said. “I just print them. I thought\nyou should know how you stand in the consciousness of the Palo people.”\n“Then why am I here?” Vlora demanded loudly. More than one face\nturned toward her at the outburst. “Why was I invited to this gala if I’m\nnothing but a figurehead for what these people see as evil?” She’d had\nnothing to drink, yet her head felt foggy, her vision swimming.\n“I don’t know,” Tampo said quietly. He seemed pleased by her reaction,"

He seemed pleased by her reaction,\nand it made her bristle. “Perhaps not everyone here thinks you are a villain.\nBut how can I know? Anyway, Lady Flint, it’s been lovely meeting you.\nHave a wonderful evening and, if I may give you some advice, beware the\nDepths. They aren’t kind to strangers.”\nTampo disappeared into the crowd before Vlora could come up with a\nretort, leaving her to fume silently. She wanted nothing more at that\nmoment than to kill something, and the little voice in the back of her head –\nwhich sounded suspiciously like Olem – told her to remove herself from a\nroom full of civilians before someone said something stupid to her.\nShe managed to find a promising wing off the main hall with no\noccupants. It was dimly lit, and she could sense no patrolling guards as she\nslapped one hand against the yellow limestone and gave out an angry groan.\nTaniel bloody Two-shot. Eleven years since he severed their engagement –\ndeservedly so – and destroyed her professional and personal reputation. Her\nlife might have been over had not the Adran-Kez War started immediately,\nand Vlora’s skills were needed so badly it gave her the opportunity to win\nback some friends.\nTaniel had forgiven her – or so he said – before his death. But even after\nall this time it hung over her head, a specter of bad choices that haunted her\nbed, driving her to Olem, a man who never judged her even though she\nrefused to marry him or have his children. She thought all the self-loathing\nof that choice was locked away in a cabinet at the back of her head, only\nvisible to her, but now it was back to affect her professional life.\nA villain.\nShe was half-tempted to head back inside and call Tampo out, Mama\nPalo’s rules be damned. She slapped the rough stone wall again and again,\nuntil her hand ached and her palm bled. She was here with a job to do,\npeople to charm, and now she didn’t think she’d be able to focus again at all\ntonight. What a damned waste.\n“Lady Flint?”\nVlora ran fingers through her hair, collecting herself, and hid her\nbleeding hand behind her back as she turned to find a Palo man standing\nbehind her. He was only a little taller than she, with graying red hair and\nfreckles so thick that his face might as well have been ash. He wore a fine\ntan suit that wouldn’t be out of place in Adran high society, the collar\nflipped up. He must have been around fifty, and she recognized him as one\nof the men Vallencian had pointed out. Vlora cleared her throat. “Meln-\nDun?”\n“That’s right,” he said in slightly accented Kez. “I don’t speak Adran. Is\nKez all right?”\n“Kez is fine,” Vlora answered.\n“Have we met?”\n“No, I’m sorry. The Ice Baron pointed you out to me.”\n“As he did you to me just a few moments ago. I hope I’m not\ninterrupting anything?”\nVlora could feel the limestone grit still stuck in her hand, her fingers"

I hope I’m not\ninterrupting anything?”\nVlora could feel the limestone grit still stuck in her hand, her fingers\nslick with blood. “No, not at all. Is there something I can help you with?”\n“Vallencian mentioned we might be able to help each other. It seems\nyou’re worried about the safety of your troops.”\nVallencian has a damned big mouth. Vlora chose her words carefully.\n“That is true,” she admitted. “But I don’t want to give you the wrong idea.\nThe Riflejack Mercenary Company is a stranger to Landfall and we’ve been\nplaced here rather suddenly to act as a garrison. I’ve been told that\nGreenfire Depths, and the Palo who occupy it, have an understandable\ndistaste for anyone who works for the Lady Chancellor. I’d hoped to figure\nout a way around that. It’s why I’m here, actually, though I’m not doing a\nvery good job at it.” She looked at her bloody palm, certain Meln-Dun\ncouldn’t see it in the dim light. “You’re the first Palo I’ve spoken to\ntonight.”\n“But not the last, I think,” Meln-Dun said.\n“Oh?”\nMeln-Dun came up beside her, frowning down at her hand, which she\nhid once more behind her back. “We’re all a little curious why you were\ninvited here, Lady Flint. Mama Palo hasn’t shared her reason with us, but\nwe suspect that she wishes to have the same thing you do – a truce.”\nVlora almost let out a sigh of relief, muscles relaxing throughout her\nbody. “Is it possible?” she asked.\n“Your reputation works against you down here,” Meln-Dun said. “Some\nthink of you as a butcher. But it also works for you, and even more of us\nconsider you an honorable person with a dishonorable master. Vallencian\nhas been telling anyone who will listen that you’re here on a mission of\npeace – that you want to work with us, rather than kill us.”\nInteresting interpretation. “I would prefer that, yes.”\n“I read in the newspapers that your men will begin a new public works\nproject. Vallencian claims the same thing. Is this true?”\n“What? Oh, yes. It is. We’re going to tear down some of the tenements\nup on the Rim and rebuild them with newer, safer materials and standards.\nWe’ve already moved the occupants of two tenements to temporary\nlodgings.”\n“That’s wonderful,” Meln-Dun said warmly. “And this is where I think\nwe can help each other. The Lady Chancellor has public works projects all\nover the city, but never in Greenfire Depths. I believe the tension between\nthe Palo and the Blackhats has prevented this. But you could work as a\nbridge between us, and if you could change your project so that your men\ncome down here and begin the monumental task of cleaning up the\ntenements in the Depths… well, I believe I could help you strike that deal,\nand grant you the protection you’re after.”\nVlora licked her lips. This was it. This was her way into the Depths, and\nit was being offered to her on a golden platter. There must be a catch – there\nwas always a catch – but it seemed very straightforward.

She had wanted to\nfocus on the Rim, where she could keep her men safer, but if she could\nconvince the Blackhats to give them the resources to begin a teardown in\none corner of the Depths she could learn more about the people who live\ndown here, meet their leadership – perhaps even find Mama Palo.\n“That would be fantastic,” Vlora said, trying not to sound too excited,\n“but I’m not sure I could convince the Blackhats to let me go through with\nit.”\n“I understand,” Meln-Dun said. “The Blackhats and their bureaucracy\nare enemies even to their allies. But if you’re willing to try, this would\nmake great strides in mending the rift between our people.”\nPit, Vlora realized, if this worked she might not even have to take down\nMama Palo. This could end peacefully, without her having to betray\nVallencian’s trust or kill anyone. It seemed like the light at the end of the\ntunnel and she ran toward it full tilt. “I’ll try.”\n“Thank you, Lady Flint. Now, if you’d like to accompany me back\ninside, I’ll introduce you to some of the people who could help you make\nthis happen.”\nVlora took out a handkerchief and cleaned her hand, then took Meln-\nDun’s offered arm. She was no longer that scared, foolish girl she once was.\nShe was Lady Flint, a decorated general, and she could not afford to feel\nsorry for herself.\nShe had work to do.\nCHAPTER 19\nS\ntyke and the dragonman faced each other for an impossibly long moment\nas the world around them seemed to slow to a crawl. As far as Styke was\nconcerned, there were only three people left in Landfall: the dragonman,\nCeline, and him. Celine fell quiet, continuing to wriggle helplessly in the\ndragonman’s grip. Styke felt the handle of his knife slippery against the\nsweat on his palm. This was not a good situation. The dragonman had the\nupper hand, and Styke had always done his best not to fight when he wasn’t\nconfident of a win.\nIt would be better to retreat, let the dragonman slip away, and live to\nfight another day. That’s what Colonel Ben Styke would have done,\nregardless of his reckless reputation. But the dragonman had Celine, and he\ndidn’t look like he wanted to “just slip away.”\n“Why are you following me?” the dragonman demanded. Styke\nremained silent, and the dragonman twisted his fingers. Celine let out a cry.\nStyke took half a step forward, but the dragonman twisted harder and\nCeline’s eyes brimmed with tears.\n“Orders,” Styke said.\n“From who?”\n“Your mother.”\n“Funny. From who, big man? Who’s asking questions about the\ndragonmen?”\n“You think I care about the girl?”\n“Of course you do. I can see it in your eyes.”\n“Do you know what will happen if you hurt her?”\nThe dragonman’s eyes dropped to the knife in Styke’s hand. He snorted,"

He snorted,\nas if finding such a large weapon preposterous. Styke was easily a foot and\na half taller than the dragonman and yet he seemed completely uncowed by\nStyke’s height. It was annoying. “You’re a cripple,” the dragonman said.\n“You’re fast. You’re strong. But I saw all your tricks back at the pub. I’ll slit\nthe girl’s throat and then I’ll kill you, too. It won’t be hard.”\n“Is that what they teach you in the Dynize army? To kill children?”\nThe dragonman’s eyes tightened. “Children bleed as easy as anyone\nelse, don’t they? Why would they be spared? A child is nothing but a future\nenemy.”\n“Why are the Dynize in Landfall?” Styke demanded. “Why were they in\nthe Tristan Basin? What do you want with Fatrasta?” He was getting angry,\nand fighting angry wasn’t going to help him.\nThe dragonman allowed a small frown to cross his face. “You act as if\nyou have the power here. Is this common among you Kressians? To make\ndemands from a weaker bargaining position? Because it is foolish. Only the\nstrong receive answers.” As if to make his point he tightened his grip, and\nCeline let out a whimper.\n“Ben…”\nStyke ignored her. She wasn’t part of this. She couldn’t be part of this.\nHer survival did not matter right now. He had to focus all his energy on the\ndragonman, or he would lose the coming fight. Everything about the\ndragonman was getting on his nerves, from his acid calm to the way he\ndidn’t even sweat in the summer heat. He focused on that, allowing\nannoyance, instead of anger, to prepare him for a scuffle.\nStyke put Celine out of his mind and looked the dragonman in the face.\n“Lady Flint. Her men killed one of you people up in the Tristan Basin. It\nwas a rough fight, and she wanted to know if there were any more of you\naround.” He felt a stab of satisfaction as the dragonman’s mouth opened\nslightly, real surprise registering in his eyes.\n“Sebbith is dead?”\n“Yeah. Sebbith is dead. He died squealing like a helpless little girl.\nBegged for his mother like a green recruit, and shit himself as he bled out.”\nThe dragonman stiffened. “That is a lie!”\nStyke locked eyes with Celine in the moment the dragonman lost his\ncalm. He made a chomping motion with his jaw, and Celine immediately\ntwisted around, biting down hard on the dragonman’s wrist. By the time her\nteeth closed on the dragonman’s skin, Styke was already running, whipping\nhis knife overhand as hard as he could.\nTwo things happened at once. The dragonman tossed Celine aside as\neasily as a doll, and he stepped to one side, snagging the knife out of midair\nas easily as if it were a ball. Styke slammed into him a moment later, not\nbothering with finesse, throwing all his weight at the dragonman’s chest."

Styke slammed into him a moment later, not\nbothering with finesse, throwing all his weight at the dragonman’s chest.\nBoth his knife and the dragonman’s went flying. They crashed to the\nboardwalk, and Styke felt pricks like adder bites as the dragonman struck\nhim flat-handed below the ribs. Styke ignored the punches and snatched the\ndragonman by the throat with his bad hand, drawing back his good into a\nfist. His heavy lancer’s ring connected with the dragonman’s nose, which\nbroke beneath the blow, showering them both with blood.\nThey rolled through the alley trash, punching and kicking. Styke took\ntwo quick blows to the head that left him seeing stars, and another to the\njaw. He tried to get a solid grip on the dragonman but every time he did, the\nslippery bastard managed to get loose. They locked hands, and to his\nsurprise the dragonman slowly forced Styke’s arm away, then punched him\ntwice below the arm. Styke tasted blood in his mouth, and spit it into the\nface of his opponent.\nThe dragonman managed to slip out of his grip again and was suddenly\non his feet. Styke was too slow, coming up behind him and receiving a boot\nto his face for his troubles. The dragonman turned on Styke, seemingly to\nattack, before he looked up and suddenly fled, disappearing down the alley\nand into a nearby warehouse.\nStyke remained on his hands and knees, blood dripping from his nose\nonto the boardwalk, and only looked up at the murmur of voices. A crowd\nhad gathered, at least two dozen people, and someone was calling for the\ncity police. The dragonman, it seemed, did not want to be seen by the\npublic. Styke filed that bit of information away before getting to his feet.\nCeline hid behind a nearby crate, sniffling and nursing an arm. Styke\nretrieved his knife, saw that the dragonman had dropped his own, and\npicked up that, too, before lifting Celine in one arm and pushing his way\nthrough the crowd. He was followed for about a block before people\nseemed to lose interest and he was able to disappear into the evening traffic.\nHe remained on the larger streets, ignoring the people who stared at his\nbloody clothes, until he was sure the dragonman hadn’t doubled around to\nfollow him. He found a quiet pub at the base of the plateau and ordered\nhimself a beer and washbasin, then carefully checked Celine. She had\nbruises on the back of her neck, and when he touched her arm she did not\ncry out.\n“Is it broken?” she asked.\n“No,” Styke replied. “Can you bend it?”\nShe bent it several times for him. Bruising, then. She probably caught\nherself on it when the dragonman threw her. She stared at her feet.\n“Anything else hurt?” Styke asked.\n“My neck.”\n“It’ll heal.”\n“I know.”\n“You did good back there. Sorry I didn’t find you sooner.”\nCeline sniffled, rubbing her nose on her sleeve. “I’m mad he caught me.\nShouldn’t have happened. Dad would have been furious.”\n“Shit happens,” Styke said, finally allowing himself to sit down. He"

He\ntook a deep breath and drank his beer the moment the barmaid brought it\nover, then cleaned his face and hands in the washbasin they brought him\nnext. When he finished he put one finger under Celine’s chin, lifting her\nface so they looked each other in the eye, and he considered her for several\nmoments. What a funny kid. She was a knife’s stroke away from being a\ngoner, yet she was disappointed in herself for getting caught in the first\nplace. She probably didn’t even know how close she’d come to dying.\nStyke wasn’t about to tell her.\n“You did well,” he repeated. He put one arm around her, pulling her\nagainst his chest. He considered the anger that had almost overtaken him\nwhen she was in danger, and wondered if this was what it was like having a\nflesh-and-blood kid. He’d been furious, protective. Like he was when one\nof his men had been in danger back in the war, but… more.\n“I didn’t do good. I lost him,” Celine said, frowning.\nStyke patted her on the cheek and drew the bone knife from his pocket.\nHe held it up to the oil lamps of the pub. Swamp dragon bone, if the stories\nwere true. Guess they had swamp dragons over in Dynize, too. The damned\nthing was bloody sharp. “Oh,” he said, “I wouldn’t say we lost him for\ngood. I’ve got a feeling he’ll come looking for this.”\nIt took only a glance for Michel to realize that the secretary wouldn’t be\nmuch help. Within minutes of arrival at Tampo’s office building – probably\nabout the time she figured out she was in Blackhat custody – she was a\nnervous wreck, and no one had so much as laid a hand on her. Michel sat on\nTampo’s desk, staring sullenly at the crates of Sins of Empire, wishing that\nhe had it in him to beat on a helpless person.\nHe needed something to punch.\nHe got up and paced the room. Warsim had already confirmed with the\nlandlord that the false Tampo was, indeed, the janitor, and it was agreed that\nthe two had the same general hair color and build. Michel had the Iron\nRoses take all the hapless man’s information and sent him home. The\nsecretary they kept, sitting behind her own desk. She tried to put on a brave\nface in what she probably thought was her last night of freedom before a\nlong stint in the labor camps.\nMichel crossed to her desk. “What’s your name?”\n“Glenna.”\n“Glenna what?”\n“Just Glenna. I don’t have a family name.”\n“Right. Now, Glenna, tell me exactly what you do here.”\nGlenna’s eyes were wide, her whole body trembling. “I’m so sorry, I\ndidn’t know you were a Blackhat. I didn’t mean to do any —”\n“Just,” Michel cut her off, “tell me what you do.”\n“I’m Mr. Tampo’s secretary.

I remain here and\nkeep the office tidy, handle his mail, and deal with any visitors that might\ncome by.”\n“Are there many?”\n“No! There’s an occasional workman, sometimes another attorney. I\nwas ordered never to take any names – just introduce them if Mr. Tampo is\nin and take a brief message if he is out.”\n“How does Tampo know who the messages are from?”\n“I give a brief description of the caller. Tall, fair-haired, smokes a pipe.\nThat kind of thing. Mr. Tampo has always taken that as sufficient. He told\nme that no one will ever have this address that doesn’t know his particular\nmethod of communication. That’s why I was so suspicious when you came\nby today.”\n“What about the mail?” Michel asked, feeling his frustration deepen.\nTampo was careful. Damned careful.\n“Always outgoing,” Glenna said. “Sometimes to Adro or Novi. Maybe\nBrudania. Redstone and Little Starland. I never see the letters themselves. I\njust drop them in the post.”\n“How does he pay you?”\n“Cash. Every two weeks. Same time he has me pay the rent.”\n“When’s the last time you saw him? Today?”\n“No. Four days ago. He worked late one evening and told me he might\ncome in tonight.”\n“But you didn’t see him at all today?” Michel growled. This was getting\nhim absolutely nowhere. Tampo had to have slipped up. No one was this\nthorough.\n“After your visit this afternoon I sent him a message at our usual place –\nhe keeps a box at the bank in Lindshire he checks every afternoon so I can\ncontact him in an emergency – and told him that a strange man stopped by\ndemanding to see him. I got a response by courier telling me to head home\nearly and come in late tomorrow morning.”\n“Is Tampo always this cautious?”\n“I never thought of it that way, but now that you mention it, yes.”\n“And you never considered it suspicious?”\n“I thought he was an eccentric.”\n“Of course you did.” Michel continued to pepper Glenna with questions\nfor another half hour while Agent Warsim wrote down her answers.\nMichel’s frustration only continued to increase as it became clear that\nTampo didn’t make the kind of mistakes that most people did. He didn’t\neven make uncommon mistakes. His planning was damned perfect.\n“What about the crates?” Michel asked. He reached down, picked up\none of the copies of Sins of Empire that he’d knocked over earlier, and\nwaved it under Glenna’s nose. “Did you know what was in them?”\nGlenna recoiled. “They were delivered just yesterday. I’m not a\nrevolutionary! I’m a secretary and a good Fatrastan. If I’d known what was\nin them I would have reported it to the police immediately.”\n“You were never curious?”\nGlenna lifted her chin. “Of course I was curious.

Get out of here before I change\nmy mind. If Mr. Tampo contacts you, you’re to let us know immediately.”\nGlenna fled the room, a look of relief on her face.

I want to know her\nevery move.” Warsim nodded and left the room, and Michel waved to the\nother two remaining Iron Roses. “Outside. I need a moment to think.”\nThe room was soon empty, leaving Michel alone with all the crates of\npamphlets. He pinched the bridge of his nose, staring at the floor, furious\nwith himself. “You were sloppy.”\n“I did everything I could,” he snapped back.\n“You were sloppy, and you’ve lost your chance at a Gold Rose.”\n“I’m a spy, not an investigator. I shouldn’t even be on this case.”\n“You’re the one who offered to take it further. You’ve got two failures in\na row to explain to Fidelis Jes.”\nMichel paced the room. This Tampo wasn’t some careful academic. He\nknew how to hide, and how to protect himself from being discovered. He’d\nhad experience in counterespionage, maybe back during the war or in the\nNine. Pit, for all Michel knew he could be a rogue or retired spy from one\nof the cabals of the Nine. How perfect would that be?\nThere was a knock on the door and Warsim poked his head inside.\nMichel opened his mouth to snap at him but managed to rein in his temper.\n“What is it?” he said.\n“I thought you’d want to know the grand master is on his way over\nhere.”\nMichel felt a knot tighten in the pit of his stomach. Shit.\nCHAPTER 20\nS\ntyke returned to Loel’s Fort at almost two o’clock in the morning.

He didn’t quite feel like he was “one” of\nthe Riflejacks yet, and the dilapidated barracks was still under construction,\nso he rented a cheap room a block away.

He laid Celine down on a sofa in the\ncorner, then stretched down to touch his toes, hearing his back pop in\nseveral places. The muscles of his bad knee twinged painfully. He dug a bit\nof horngum out of his pocket and tucked it into his cheek.\n“Trouble?” Olem asked.\n“Nothing I couldn’t handle.” Styke wondered when he’d last played\ncards. It was next to impossible to get a full deck in the labor camps. The\ncamp guards thought it was funny to remove the same three cards from each\ndeck you could buy at the camp commissary. It was annoying, but the\nconvicts just came up with their own games to play that required three\nfewer cards.\n“Heard someone busted up Mama Sender’s earlier tonight,” Olem said.\n“Some big beast of a guy killed three Palo and crippled a fourth. Took off\nchasing a fifth. Mama Sender swore he looked just like Ben Styke.”\nStyke scratched behind his ear. “Yeah, about that. I should probably\nsend her a few hundred krana.”\nOlem threw a card down. “Already took care of it. Nobody in this city\ncares much about some dead Palo. Just try to clean up better next time. Any\nluck tracking down a dragonman?”\nStyke examined Olem for a few moments. No tone of reproach. Just\nprofessionalism. He liked that. Olem seemed distracted, though, and despite\neveryone else in the room looking tired-eyed the silence at the card table\nwas tense. What were they all doing up this late on a weeknight? Olem’s\nKnack kept him from needing sleep, but the others doubtless had duties in\nthe morning.\n“I did,” Styke said. “Was going to leave a message for Lady Flint and\nthen head to bed. She’s not awake still, is she?”\nOlem reached over, plucking a cigarette from an ashtray on the table\nand sucking on the end, discarding it with a disgusted look when he realized\nit had gone out. “Lady Flint is down in Greenfire Depths.”\nStyke froze mid-stretch. “Alone?”\n“Yeah. Got invited to a gala at something called the Yellow Hall. They\nwouldn’t let her bring an escort or anything, and this is her best shot at\ngetting an in with the Palo.”\n“You let her go into Greenfire Depths alone?”\nOlem looked up, an angry glint in his eye. “I don’t ‘let’ Lady Flint do\nanything. She can take care of herself better than anyone in this room.”\nIncluding you, his tone implied. Styke wasn’t about to argue with the\nsentiment, but he still didn’t like it. Here he was, off chasing mythical\nwarriors, when his real purpose – Lady Flint – was off in the most\ndangerous part of Landfall without a guard. If she got herself killed right\nnow, Tampo might very well sell Styke back to the Blackhats.\nStyke made a calming motion with his hands. “Agreed, but Greenfire"

One person, all alone in\nthe Depths? This wasn’t an invitation; it was a damned death trap.\n“What could we do?” Olem asked. “None of us knows this place.\nWithout her invitation, she wouldn’t even be able to find the Yellow Hall.”\nStyke rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. This was bad. He pointed at\nOlem. “I can. But if she’s meant to be alone there’s no taking an army down\nthere. Let’s go.”\nHe expected an argument, or an indignant response about giving out\norders. Instead Olem threw down his cards, scooped up a pile of coins, and\nwordlessly buckled on his belt. “Any of you know where Davd or Norrine\nis?” he asked the table. He was answered by a round of headshaking and\ngave a frustrated grunt.\nStyke went over to the sofa, nudging Celine awake. “You told me that\nyou know Greenfire Depths. Can you find the Yellow Hall?” he asked\ngently. It took her a moment to wake up, then she was on her feet. “It’s been\na while,” he added. “The Depths change, and I’m rusty.”\n“I can find it,” Celine assured him.\nStyke nodded to Olem. “Let’s go find Lady Flint, and hope we’re not\ntoo damned late.”\nVlora spent hours mingling with the Palo elite and their Kressian business\npartners. She relaxed for the first time since entering the city, laughing at\njokes, smiling, doing her best to drop the stony demeanor that had earned\nher her epithet. She was surprised to find most of the elite well educated,\nsome of them even having gone to universities in the Nine, and by the end\nof the evening she could have been convinced that this was a whole\ndifferent class of people from the insurrectionist tribes she’d put down in\nthe swamps.\nThe guests retired one by one, leaving through the front door and down\nside halls, until only a handful remained. Vlora said her good-byes to\nVallencian and Meln-Dun, pleased that Tampo was nowhere in sight, and\nfound Devin-Tallis sleeping in his rickshaw outside. Water dripped through\nthe tenements, and somewhere distant she could hear the patter of rain on\nthe roofs well above them.\nShe woke Devin-Tallis, and they were soon heading down the narrow\nstreets. “Was the celebration to your standards?” he asked.\nVlora settled into her seat, feeling more at ease and confident, slightly\nbuzzed from one too many drinks. She had let her guard down, but now felt\npleased to have done so. “I think I made some friends tonight,” she said.\n“Very good, Lady Flint. Ah, I found out what ‘Ka’ stands for while I\nwaited for you.”\n“Oh?”\n“‘Ka’ is one who protects. It’s a Dynize epithet, meant only for bone-\neyes from the royal family. None of the tribes use it.”\nVlora tilted her head. “The Dynize haven’t been here for a very long"

How could anyone possibly know it?”\n“Our languages are similar. Besides, I asked one of the old-timers. The\nPalo, we have so little property that we pass down knowledge like you\nwould family heirlooms.”\n“Sounds like it comes in handy.”\n“It does, Lady Flint.” Devin-Tallis smiled over his shoulder at her. “See,\nLady Flint. There is more than just fear in Greenfire Depths. There is\nknowledge, even friendship. I think that you…” He trailed off, suddenly\nslowing.\n“Is there something wrong?” Vlora asked, leaning forward, her pleasant\nbuzz dissipating like a morning fog.\nDevin-Tallis looked one way, then the other, then turned toward her. He\nopened his mouth and let out a quiet groan, and it took her a moment to see\nthe blood leaking from between his lips. Vlora scrambled from her seat,\nthrowing herself forward to catch Devin-Tallis as he fell, lowering him into\nthe rickshaw with one hand and jamming a powder charge into her mouth\nwith the other. The power lit her veins and darkness became like day to her\neyes, revealing two things at once.\nFirst, that Devin-Tallis had a long, slender dart sticking out of his neck.\nSecond, that they were not alone. The corridors around them were filled\nwith shadows, at least a dozen Palo men and women holding cudgels,\nknives, and swords. They seemed confident that she could not see them and\ncrouched in waiting while one of their number reloaded a blowgun.\nVlora drew her pistol and put a bullet between the culprit’s startled eyes\nbefore he could bring the blowgun to his lips.\nThe crack and flash of the pistol seemed to freeze everyone in place.\nVlora glanced at Devin-Tallis and could see he would be dead within\nmoments. She tasted the powder on her tongue, rubbed the grit of it against\nthe roof of her mouth, and reveled in the strength it gave her. “You’ve made\na terrible mistake,” she said, drawing her sword.\nThe words acted like a signal, and everyone seemed to fly into motion\nat once. Palo poured from the alleys, weapons raised, war cries on their lips.\nShe let the first one run straight onto her blade and then jerked it with the\nstrength of a powder mage, disemboweling him instantly, spraying gore into\nthe eyes of his companion, whom she cut down as he tried to wipe away the\nblood. She flipped her pistol around in her left hand, ignoring the way the\nbarrel burned her already wounded palm, and slammed the butt across the\ntemple of another assailant while her sword worked in the opposite\ndirection, opening the throat of a fourth.\nThe first four went down in as little time as it took them to reach her.\nShe darted to the side, her footwork uncertain in the mucky street, and\nparried a sword that slashed at her face. She countered two more strokes\nand then ducked low, ramming her sword through the man’s stomach and\nthen shoving, skewering the woman behind him.\nWithout a powder trance, Vlora knew she would be considered a top-\nnotch fighter among any company, and it became instantly clear that these"

She had\ntrained her whole life as a soldier and a duelist. Her actions were cold and\nprecise, the blade of her weapon aimed to kill or disable instantly, and she\nwas fueled by the anger of seeing the innocent family man behind her die in\nhis rickshaw.\nShe cut down two more before the concerted effort of four of the\nattackers managed to halt her forward momentum, presenting a wall of\nblades in a narrow corridor, forcing her to retreat lest she skewer herself\nupon their swords. She backed up, biding her time and checking her rear to\nbe sure she wasn’t being outflanked, waiting for one of them to make a\nmistake.\nBehind them, she watched a fifth scramble for the blowgun that had\nbeen dropped by one of their companions, and she cursed herself for not\nbringing a second pistol. She fought a rising panic, knowing she needed to\nbreak through these blades and take them down or turn and flee, but fearing\nthe possibility of running into even more attackers.\nVlora heard footsteps in the mud behind her and swore. She’d been\noutflanked. She pressed her back to a wall, holding her pistol in one hand\nand her sword in the other, trying to look in both directions at once.\nShe caught sight of a shadow behind the Palo who recovered the\nblowgun. The shadow grew so suddenly she thought her eyes were playing\ntricks on her until the hooked tip of a boz knife suddenly jutted from the\nPalo’s chest. The Palo coughed, crying out, and was lifted into the air and\nthrown at his companions.\nThe shadow became Ben Styke, wearing his old yellow cavalry jacket,\nhis face somehow uglier and meaner in the shadows of the gas lanterns.\nBehind her, footsteps became louder as Olem rounded the corner, his pistol\nraised. He shot one of her assailants in the chest. The dual distraction was\nall Vlora needed and she darted forward, dispatching the three remaining\nPalo in as many breaths.\nHer chest heaved as she caught her breath, heart thumping from the\nadrenaline of the fight more than the effort. She nodded to Styke, briefly\ntouched Olem’s shoulder, then headed over to the rickshaw, where Devin-\nTallis had already gone still. She plucked the dart from his neck, broke it\nbetween her fingers, and cast it aside. “Poisoned,” she said, not bothering to\nhide the disgust in her voice.\n“Pit,” Styke breathed, surveying the line of corpses down the corridor.\n“You weren’t kidding when you said she could handle herself.”\nOlem came up beside Vlora, putting one hand gently on her waist. She\nresisted the urge to lay her head on his shoulder, her body still trembling.\n“Are you all right?” he asked quietly.\n“I’m fine,” Vlora said.\nStyke took two steps toward her, squinting in the dim light as he looked\nher over. “Didn’t even get a scratch. Pit, remind me not to cross you.”"

Better than I could have hoped. I have no idea\nwhat provoked this.” She kicked one of the corpses, letting out an angry\ngrunt.\nBeside her, Styke bent to clean his knife. He gestured to someone Vlora\ncouldn’t see, and Celine emerged from the shadows to join him, her eyes\nwide at all the carnage. “This,” Styke told her gently, “is what happens\nwhen boys try to play with a woman like Lady Flint.” He stood up. “We\nshould go,” he said. “If they’re smart, they’ll have a backup team in case\nthey missed and your rickshaw made a run for it.”\nVlora touched Devin-Tallis’s forehead, then nodded. Whoever ordered\nthis, she decided, had very little time left to live. She would make sure of\nthat.\nCHAPTER 21\nM\nichel waited outside the office building for Fidelis Jes to arrive. His\nIron Roses kept a cool distance, none of them eager to face a Silver\nRose’s foul mood, while Warsim had disappeared on another errand. Michel\nkept his eyes closed, his mind frantically working as he tried to come up\nwith something – anything – to tell Jes about how his investigation wasn’t a\ncomplete failure. He’d been handed the opportunity to catch Tampo red-\nhanded, and he had failed. Sure, he’d done all the groundwork and set\nhimself up for that possible success. But Fidelis Jes wasn’t going to see it\nthat way.\nWhat was he doing wrong? Was he not considering all the angles? Was\nhe out of his depth? In Tampo, he was clearly dealing with a professional.\nBut wasn’t he supposed to be a professional, too?\n“I’m a spy,” he muttered to himself. “Not a bloody investigator. This\nisn’t what I’m good at.”\n“You’re good at getting inside people’s heads,” he countered himself.\n“You’re good at knowing what people will think, and why, and when.\nThat’s all the basic stuff an investigator needs to do, right?”\nHe made a frustrated sound in the back of his throat. “I am not an\ninvestigator. I know what people will think about me, and why and when.\nAll that matters is keeping my cover. That’s not the case here.”\n“So,” he muttered back at himself, “what is the case?”\n“I need to know the why and when regarding their relation to what\nthey’re doing. Not in regards to their relations with me.”\nMichel ran a hand through his hair, then tapped the side of his head with\nhis fingers. That might be the key here. Michel was so focused on simply\ncatching the guy that he hadn’t considered his motives. Why was Tampo\ndoing all this?

    "text": "Revolutionaries tended to be high on passion and low on critical thinking\nand this was certainly not the case.\nCould it be he wasn’t a revolutionary? Did he have another motive for\nattempting to destabilize the country? Michel still had a copy of Sins of\nEmpire in his pocket, and wondered whether the writing behind it was\ncalculated to incite revolt, rather than a work of passion as he’d assumed.\nIt was an intriguing thought, and it gave him an entirely new outlook on\nthis case.\nThe clop of hooves on cobbles brought Michel out of his reverie and he\nstiffened, watching as a carriage with a white rose on black curtains pulled\nup in front of him. The door was thrown open and Fidelis Jes emerged\nbefore the carriage had even come to a stop. The grand master was clearly\nin a foul mood, his jaw tight and eyes pinched, the collar of his\nimmaculately pressed jacket undone. Michel knew Jes was a man of a strict\nschedule, and he wondered if this case was really important enough to have\nhim out in the middle of the night like this.\nFidelis Jes stopped in front of Michel, glancing around as if to ask\nwhere the culprit was.\nWell. No delaying the inevitable. “He slipped away, sir.”\n“Explain.”\nThe one word made a bead of sweat trickle down Michel’s spine. “He’s\na professional, sir. Someone with counterespionage training. He had several\nfail-safes in place so that we couldn’t catch him, and tonight’s raid has\ntipped our hand. I’m worried he’ll go deeper undercover.” Fidelis Jes\nopened his mouth, but Michel pushed onward with a sudden spike of\nconfidence. “Sir, I think we’ve been going about this wrong. In light of this\nrevelation, I don’t think we’re up against a revolutionary. I think we’re up\nagainst someone who is dispassionately trying to take down the\ngovernment. My first instinct is that someone is betting against us, against\nour economy, and I’d like permission to make a thorough search of wealthy\nforeigners who have traded against our market. It shouldn’t take more than\na few weeks, and all I have to do is see him in a place of business and then\nwe’ll catch him and bring him down.”\nFidelis Jes stared at Michel for several moments, his eyes going out of\nfocus as if his mind was elsewhere, and he gave a brisk nod. “Intriguing,\nAgent Bravis. I expect you to continue your investigation immediately.”\nMichel felt like a refreshing wind had just passed through his body.\nEvery muscle relaxed. That was it? No death threats? No anger? Just a nod\nand “carry on”?\nFidelis Jes looked around at the Iron Roses and gestured for them to\ncome closer. It was only eight or nine people, but the grand master\naddressed them as he might an army, with his hands clasped behind his\nback, chest out, sword at his side. “You’re all to report to the Millinery\nimmediately. Every Rose is on double duty for the next week.”\nNo one gave voice to the groan they must have all been holding in, but\nseveral of them shifted uncomfortably.\nJes continued: “There has been an escape from one of the local labor\ncamps.

    "text": "several of them shifted uncomfortably.\nJes continued: “There has been an escape from one of the local labor\ncamps. A dangerous war criminal by the name of Benjamin Styke. Every\nIron and Bronze Rose is on alert until Styke is caught. When you report to\nthe Millinery you will be given a description and an exhaustive report as to\nall his known associates. Find him. Catch him. He must be brought in alive.\nDismissed.”\nThe Iron Roses scattered, and Michel found himself alone with the\ngrand master a few moments later. They remained standing in silence for\nseveral minutes while Jes looked up and down the streets, eyeing rooftops,\nas if considering where this dangerous criminal could be hiding.\nMichel knew the name. Pit, everyone knew the name. Colonel Styke\nhad practically surpassed “war hero” and gone straight to “folk hero.”\n“Sir,” Michel finally ventured, “isn’t Ben Styke…”\n“He’s alive. Forget everything you know about Benjamin Styke,”\nFidelis Jes said, his eyes still examining the surrounding buildings. “He is a\ncrazed killer. He will murder anyone and anything, and he holds a grudge\nagainst the Lady Chancellor. I fear for her very safety.”\n“He’s just one man, sir.”\nJes whirled on him, forcing Michel to step back. “Styke is his own\narmy. Do not underestimate him. He’s older, crippled, but he will not be\neasy to take down.” Jes took a measured breath, before going on in a calmer\nvoice. “Styke has the loyalty of the city’s veterans. The last thing I need is\nhim stirring up trouble.”\n“Of course, sir. Am I… still on this investigation?”\n“Yes. Why wouldn’t you be?”\n“Well, this Styke thing seems to be important.”\n“Oh, you’ll be keeping your eyes open for Styke as well.” Jes smirked.\n“Your failure to catch Tampo tonight has just made your job infinitely\nharder, Agent Bravis. I’ve been questioning the traitorous prison officials\nwho allowed themselves to be bribed to secure Styke’s release. It turns out\nthey were paid off by a Mr. Tampo, Esquire. They even gave a description\nthat matched that of your suspect.”\nAll the relief felt at not having gained Jes’s ire disappeared in a single\ninstant. Michel sagged. Not only had he not managed to capture Tampo, but\nnow he had to face the possibility of dealing with a dangerous war criminal.\nMichel wasn’t an investigator, and he definitely wasn’t a fighter. If he did\nmanage to catch up with Tampo, and Styke happened to be with him, he’d\nbe a goner.\nHe knew it, and from the smug look in Jes’s eyes, the grand master\nknew it, too.\nThe very real prospect of a violent death was punishment for his failure.\n“You’ve made great progress in such a small amount of time,” Jes said,\nalmost kindly. “I expect you to wrap this up quickly. Bring me Tampo and\nyou will earn your Gold Rose. Bring me Styke as well, and I’ll be in your\ndebt.”\nMichel watched Fidelis Jes return to his carriage and drive away.

But the rewards… he\ncouldn’t imagine many people had Fidelis Jes’s favor. But if he was going\nto catch Styke before anyone else, he’d have to be fast.\nCHAPTER 22\nC\neline led Styke and their small group out of the Depths and up to Loel’s\nFort, where the night was silent and all but a few Riflejack guards were\nin their beds. Styke followed Lady Flint into the temporary headquarters\nshe’d set up in the old staff building and stood in the doorway, not entirely\nsure what to do as Flint pulled out a notepad and scratched something on it,\nhanding it to Olem.\n“Send a messenger to Vallencian. Tell him I was attacked and my escort\nkilled.”\nOlem took the note and slipped by Styke, and Styke put a hand on\nCeline’s shoulder, turning her toward the door. “Lady Flint,” he said with a\nnod. “Glad you got out of there. I best be going.”\n“You,” Flint said, giving him pause. “Stay.” She snatched a bottle of\nwine from underneath the table in the center of the room and popped the\ncork with her knife. “You’ve earned a drink, I think.”\nStyke hesitated. For once, he was feeling less than confident about his\nposition. His task was to keep Flint alive, at least until Tampo gave the\norder, and now he wasn’t entirely sure he could kill her. She’d been\nambushed by more than a dozen men and walked away without a scratch.\nWhat hope would he have in his condition, even if he caught her unawares?\nHe’d have to cross that bridge when he reached it, he decided sourly.\nFor now it was his job to get – and remain – close. He dragged a chair over\nto the table and sat down, pulling Celine up onto his lap.\nFlint poured three glasses of wine. They drank in silence until Olem\nreturned, nodding, and brought his own chair up to the table. He took his\nglass and raised it to Flint, then to Styke.\n“My nerves are shot to shit,” she said, the words clearly directed at\nOlem.\n“The ambush?” Olem asked gently.\nFlint drained her first glass and poured another, reaching under the table\nto get a second bottle of wine. “The ambush, the powder trance – I took a\nwhole charge at once – and then the fight. I haven’t had a call that close\nsince the Kez Civil War.” Her eyes were cast down, her voice quiet, and she\nseemed suddenly vulnerable. The moment passed quickly, and she looked at\nStyke with steel in her eyes.\n“You looked like you were handling things fine,” Styke said. He\ncouldn’t get those bodies out of his head. He was used to his own path of\ndestruction. Even back during the war he rarely saw one that compared. But\npit, he found himself impressed by Flint’s. He thought about Taniel Two-\nshot, fighting out in the swamps, picking off Kez Privileged like they were\nbottles on a fence. “Powder mages,” he said softly, a curse under his breath."

Styke noticed that her hand was still\ntrembling, and remembered that she was barely thirty years old. He\nconsidered soldiers her age practically kids, even back when he was one.\n“We can be outflanked, overwhelmed, or taken by surprise. If you and\nOlem hadn’t arrived they might have done all three and finished me off.”\n“We got lucky,” Olem said. “We heard your pistol go off. We were only\nthe next street over.”\n“Though I would have expected you to turn and run against so many\nmen,” Styke added.\nFlint frowned. “They’d killed him. My escort. He was a good man –\nfunny, clever, interesting. When something like that happens, instinct kicks\nin. I barely have control of myself. It feels like I blink, and then there are\nbodies.” She met his eyes. “They call you Mad Ben Styke. Was it ever like\nthat for you? The anger?”\nStyke looked down at his glass. Pit, soldier talk. He was going to need\nmore wine than this. He gave the glass to Celine. “Just a sip,” he said, then\ndrained the rest and pushed it over to the bottle. Olem refilled it.\nStyke cleared his throat. “They say that some people are overtaken by a\nberserker rage in a battle. Their eyes mist and time seems to slow and they\njust kill everything that they see. I’ve heard people speculate that Field\nMarshal Tamas had that” – he nodded at Flint – “and that only his training\nkept him from being a true berserker.” He twirled his lancer’s ring with his\nthumb, listening to his chair creak under him as he shifted. “They called me\nMad Colonel Styke because they thought a madness took me into battle.\nBecause I made foolish charges against outrageous odds. But I’ve never had\nred mist. Sure, I lose my head sometimes, but when I kill, it’s deliberate. I\nnever —” He paused. “I rarely pick a fight I don’t think I can win.”\n“Those charges,” Olem said. “The two charges at the Battle of Landfall.\nYou knew you were going to win those?”\nStyke felt the memory flood him. He could almost taste the sweat and\nstench of the battle, the heat of burning buildings and racket of an artillery\nbombardment. He savored it. “Sounds arrogant when I say it out loud. But\nyeah, I knew I’d win. Nothing stood before me and my lancers. We wore\nenchanted armor, stuff that saw its heyday four hundred years ago, and it\nshrugged off bullets and sorcery like a parasol does rain.”\n“What happened to that armor?” Olem asked.\nStyke could still hear his voice echo in the helmet and feel the\nreassuring weight of medieval plate on his shoulders. When he flexed his\nfingers he could almost imagine the lance back in his hand once more, the\nfeel of his ring pressing against its wooden handle. “Lindet confiscated it"

Don’t know what happened after that.”\n“Pity,” Olem said.\nFlint leaned back in her chair, glass dangling from her hands. Styke had\nheard it took a lot to make a powder mage drunk, and her eyes were barely\nfoggy after a whole bottle of wine. “I want to know something,” she said.\n“Yeah?”\n“Taniel Two-shot. Was he really a hero around here?” Before Styke\ncould answer, she continued. “I mean, I’ve heard some of the stories, and\nI’ve heard his name spoken in conjunction with the war. But back then,\nwhen the whole thing happened, was he really as big of a war hero as they\nsay?”\nStyke tried to remember everything he could about Taniel Two-shot. It\nhad been a long time. “People liked him. It was romantic. A young powder\nmage, out there avenging his mother’s death against the Kez cabal almost\ntwo decades after the fact. That and fighting for Fatrastan independence to\nboot. The newspapers loved to write about him.”\n“Did the Palo take to him? I’ve heard rumors that they did, but I’ve\nnever actually asked anyone.”\n“I think so,” Styke said. “Like I said, I only actually met him once. We\nfought through the Battle of Planth together, and he saved my life by\nputting two bullets through a Warden’s skull.” He paused, trying to recall\nnewspaper articles he’d read after his imprisonment. “Yes,” he said more\nconfidently, “the Palo did take to him. One became his guide and he took\nher back to Adro with him, and…” Styke trailed off, remembering who,\nexactly, he was talking to. He cleared his throat. “They say the two of them\ngot married just before their death at the end of the Adran-Kez War.”\nFlint was entirely unreadable. “They never got married,” she said.\n“Ah.” Styke wasn’t going to push that subject.\n“She wasn’t a Palo, either,” Flint said, looking away. “She was Dynize.\nHer name was Ka-poel, and she was a bone-eye sorcerer with enough\npower to… well. She was incredibly powerful.”\nStyke remembered her. He remembered her better than he remembered\nTwo-shot, if he was being honest. He could smell the blood sorcery on her,\nand see the playful confidence that seemed so strange in the eyes of a Palo\nyouth. “A Dynize,” he echoed. “Didn’t know there were any in the\nswamps.”\n“She was a refugee of some sort,” Flint said. “Was adopted by a Palo\ntribe as a child. Taniel talked about her in his letters, and then I met her\nlater, after he brought her back and – after things were over between the two\nof us. I hated her at first. Thought she had taken Taniel away from me. But\nthen I realized that he was still mine when he got back, and that it was only\nafter I did what I did that she claimed him for herself.”\nStyke glanced over at Olem, who remained silent through the whole"

The two were obviously longtime lovers, and it couldn’t be easy to\nlive in the shadow of someone like Taniel Two-shot. But Olem just gave\nStyke a small, knowing smile, and rolled himself a cigarette. “You’re\ngetting drunk,” Olem said softly to Flint.\n“Yup,” Flint answered. “Doesn’t happen often. Feels kind of good to\ntalk about it.” Her eyes focused on Styke, and she said, “I like you. I have\nno idea why, but I do.”\n“Because we’re both killers,” Styke said before he could stop himself.\nHe held his breath, but Flint just gave him a rueful smile.\n“To killers,” she said, raising her glass.\nStyke clinked his against hers. He sensed it was time for him to leave\nthe two of them alone, and stood up, finding that Celine was already fast\nasleep in his arms. He put her over his shoulder. “I saw a dragonman\ntonight,” he said.\nSome of the haze across Flint’s face seemed to lift. “Really?”\n“He’s not a Palo. He’s a Dynize.”\nFlint seemed to sober slightly. “What the pit is a Dynize dragonman\ndoing in Landfall?” she mused, more to herself than to him.\n“He knew of the other one. The one you killed. Said his name was\nSebbith or something like that. If they knew each other, I’m guessing they\nwere both Dynize. But I don’t know why they’re here.”\n“Find out,” Flint said.\nStyke sighed. He found himself liking – even respecting – Lady Flint\nmore and more. If he did have to kill her it was going to be a challenge in\nmore ways than one. But for now, they were on the same side. “I’ll draw\nhim out,” he promised.\nVlora watched Styke carry Celine through the door. From the window she\nsaw him cross the muster yard, and she was struck once again by the\ncontrast of the man gently carrying a child that was not his own, and the\nkiller she’d witnessed down in the Depths.\n“Did you see him fight tonight?” she asked Olem.\n“I didn’t,” Olem said. “I was too busy aiming at the assholes coming\nafter you.”\nThere might have been a note of reproach in his voice, though Vlora\ndidn’t know if she deserved it. She stood by her choice to attend the gala\nalone. “He came up behind one of the Palo silent as a ghost. He put that\nknife through the guy’s sternum, then tossed him like a toy.”\n“The stories all said Ben Styke was the strongest man in Fatrasta.”\n“I wasn’t confident it was Ben Styke until now,” Vlora said. “But\ndamn.” She took another drink. The wine was loosening her lips, maybe a\nbit too much, but her heart rate had finally returned to normal. She looked\nat Olem, feeling a stab of regret. He was a soldier, and he was used to\nfriends dying in battle, but she knew that he worried for her all the same."

He was a soldier, and he was used to\nfriends dying in battle, but she knew that he worried for her all the same.\nShe suddenly felt all the things that she’d been unfair about over the years.\nIt was unfair to head off alone on a mission of unknown danger. It was\nunfair to pull rank. It was unfair to turn down his proposals for marriage\nwhen she had no intention of ever leaving him. It was unfair to put off\nhaving children, when they both wanted them.\nIt was unfair of her to lie.\n“Olem,” she said.\n“Yes?”\n“Do you remember after the end of the war? In the blood and the chaos\nwhen all those bodies were lost at Skyline Palace?”\n“Quite well, yes.” Olem’s voice was flat, controlled, his lips clamped\nfirmly around his cigarette. Vlora knew the pain the memory caused him,\nand was reluctant to add to it. No one had been closer to Field Marshal\nTamas than Olem those last few months.\nHer mouth tasted sour. She licked her lips, considering the secret she\nhad kept for ten years. It had always felt like it wasn’t hers to give, and yet\nnow she knew it was foolish not to share it. “I’ve been telling myself and\neveryone else for ten years that Taniel and Ka-poel died during that fight.\nBut they didn’t. They survived the explosion and slipped away in the\nchaos.”\nOlem sucked on his cigarette, staring at her through the smoke. “I\nfigured,” he said.\n“How?”\n“You never grieved.”\nVlora cleared her throat. Faithful, trustworthy Olem. The bastard knew\nall along. By Adom, he was the best present a commanding officer could\never get. “I love you,” she said.\n“I figured that, too.” He handed her his cigarette, then said, “Why do\nyou bring it up now?”\n“Because they told me they were heading to Fatrasta. This was ten years\nago, but I’m worried they’re still here. I’m worried they’re involved in all\nof this shit. I would have sensed his sorcery if they were in the city, but\nstill… I’m worried. If they do get involved, I can’t imagine it’ll be on\nLindet’s side, and Olem? I can’t fight Taniel or Ka-poel. Neither of them\nwas quite human when they left, and they’re out of my league.” And I don’t\nwant to fight them.\n“Well,” Olem said, lighting a new cigarette, “we better hope they aren’t\nstill around then.”\nCHAPTER 23\nM\nichel struggled through the early hours of the morning, unable to sleep\nand unable to work, trying to come up with some kind of plan for\ncapturing the two enemies of the state that Fidelis Jes so desperately wanted\nbrought in.\nHis first major decision was to discard his search for Styke. Half the\nMillinery was already looking for the old veteran, and Michel adding\nhimself to that list would do little good. No, he needed to focus on his\ncurrent goal, that of capturing Tampo.

Tampo, if he could track the bastard\ndown, would almost certainly lead him to Styke.\nAnd if all the other sods searching for Styke managed to bring him in,\nMichel might be able to use that to find Tampo.\nIt was sound logic, but it didn’t help him sleep.\nHe tossed and turned in his small attic apartment on the southern edge\nof the plateau before finally crawling out of bed and pulling on some\nclothes, heading unshaven into the first splash of morning light and taking a\nhackney cab a mile across town to the Proctor market, where he stopped to\nfill a crate with breads and fruit before heading on foot through the still-\nsleepy streets.\nProctor was the kind of town in which, in those few moments he\nallowed himself to wonder what it would be like to settle down and have a\nfamily, he imagined himself living. It wasn’t too clean, or too dirty, or too\nrich or poor. It was absolutely average in every way, and Michel loved that\nin a place like this he could be as friendly or anonymous as he liked.\nIn some ways he lived vicariously through his mother – idle days,\nreading books and chatting with neighbors, staying out of the sun.\nThe thought brought him up short next to a bookstore, and he stared\nthrough the front window as sellers carried crates of penny novels out onto\nthe sidewalk to entice passersby. He chewed on his lip, trying not to think\nof everything he should be doing right now.\n“Don’t encourage her,” he said softly to himself. “It only makes things\nworse.”\n“Oh, come on. I can be a good son once in a while.”\n“You can either be a good son by taking care of her, or you can be a\ngood son by exacerbating her bad habits. You can’t be both.”\nHe rolled his eyes at himself. “Why not?”\n“Because you don’t get to be everything, Michel. You have to choose.”\nMichel ignored the raised eyebrows of one of the booksellers and told\nhimself to shut the pit up before stepping inside and looking around for the\nmore expensive, leather-bound novels in the back. He flipped through a few\nat random, remembering a time when he used to read almost as much as his\nmother, and then selected three adventurous-sounding titles and raised a\nhand for one of the clerks.\n“Can I help you, sir?”\n“I’ll take these,” Michel said.\n“Thank you, sir,” the clerk said. “We’ll take care of the bill.”\nMichel blinked at the clerk for several seconds before realizing he was\nwearing his Blackhat uniform. Even though he kept his Silver Rose hidden\non a necklace, it wasn’t hard to tell what he was. He dug into his pocket for\na wad of krana. “I don’t mind paying,” he said.\n“It’s all right, sir,” the clerk said. “Thank you for your patronage.”\nMichel was rarely bothered by the perks that came along with his job.\nFree stuff was, after all, one of the best and he took advantage of it when he\ncould. But the idea of buying books for his mother on Blackhat goodwill\nfelt a little… off.\n“Speaking of which,” he muttered to himself, looking out the window at\nthe crates of penny novels sitting on a table on the sidewalk.

A familiar\nfigure was already perusing the selection, even though the store had only\nbeen open for minutes. Michel sighed to himself, looking instinctively for\nthe back exit, before turning back to the clerk. “Could you wrap these up\nfor me, please? Also, I’d like to pay for anything that woman out there\nwants to buy.” He thrust a ten-krana note into the clerk’s hands before he\ncould object, then stepped outside.\nHis mother stood by the penny novels, flipping through them\nthoughtfully, humming to herself and dancing slightly to the tune.\n“Morning, Mother.”\nShe jumped, turning to Michel with a look of surprise. “Michel! What\nare you doing here?”\nMichel put on his most charming smile. “Just stopped in to pick\nsomething up for my mother,” he said. “Was going to drop some food by\nyour house on my way into work.”\nA torrent of emotions crossed his mother’s face as he spoke. First she\nwas surprised, then pleased, then her face fell to frustration and anger, all in\nthe space of a few seconds. By the time he said the word “work” she looked\ndownright furious.\nShe snatched him by the arm, pulling him around the corner of the\nbookshop and into the closest alley and then turning on him with a finger\nthrust up under his nose.\n“What do you think you’re doing, Michel?” she demanded.\nMichel braced himself, his heart falling. “Shouldn’t have bothered,” he\nmuttered to himself.\n“What do you mean? Speak up, child!” She glared at his uniform,\nlooking him up and down with the kind of disgust most mothers would\nupon finding their children naked in the streets. “Wearing that uniform?\nComing around my neighborhood? What are the neighbors going to think?\nWhat are the bookshop owners going to think? I’m respected and liked\naround here!”\n“I didn’t even look to see what I was wearing,” Michel said with a\ncalming gesture, hoping that the shouting wouldn’t attract attention. He\ndidn’t need this, not today.\n“Hm!” his mother said, turning away from him. She fumed at the wall\nof the alley, looking at him sidelong.\n“Look,” he said, “I’m sorry. I know you don’t like what I do for a\nliving. I try not to complicate your life with it. But I was just trying to do\nsomething nice.”\n“Don’t like what you… ?” his mother sputtered. “It’s not that I don’t\nlike it, Michel. It’s that you’re a Blackhat! My pappy – your grandpappy –\nwas a full-blood Palo. Your father died fighting for our freedom against the\nKez. What would they think to see you in that getup? Can’t you see what\nyou are, Michel? You’re a thug! Every day you work for Lindet is another\nday you grind your birthright into the mud.”\n“Now wait just a minute,” Michel said, feeling his own blood begin to\nrise. “That’s going too far.

I’m respected doing what I do.”\n“It’s not respect if it depends on fear.”\n“I meant to the people I work with.”\n“And I’m talking about the people you Blackhats tramp into the dust.\nI’m not a fool. I read the papers and listen to the gossip. Not even Lindet\ncan keep a lid on all the news in this city. Did you know that just two streets\ndown from my house a young woman was murdered by Blackhats for\nhanding out flyers? Flyers, Michel!”\nMichel glanced over his shoulder. “Please keep your voice down,\nMother.”\n“Or what? You’re going to drag me to the Millinery dungeons? Your\nown mother? I think Lindet’s a downright bitch, and I don’t mind who hears\nit. She’s a tyrant, and you Blackhats are her bullies, and I don’t want my son\nassociated with them. Is that too much?” Her voice continued to rise in\npitch till Michel was certain that people out on the street could hear her\nclearly.\n“I’m not a… It’s not… Mother, it’s more complicated than that.”\nHis mother took several deep breaths, her jaw quivering. He hadn’t seen\nher worked up like this for years, and he wondered if it was the murder of\nthe girl she mentioned. That kind of thing might be commonplace in\nMichel’s world, but it would have shaken his mother deeply.\n“You’re a good boy,” she said quietly. “And every time I see you in that\noutfit I’m reminded what you’ve gotten yourself into.”\n“I’m sorry,” he said again. “It’s just…”\nHis mother suddenly lifted her handbag, rifling around inside it for a\nfew moments and then thrusting something in Michel’s face. He took it\nfrom her absently, trying to finish his sentence, but when his eyes focused\non the pamphlet he felt his heart fall. The now-familiar words Sins of\nEmpire were printed on the front.\n“Where did you get this?” he demanded.\n“A nice young man was handing it out yesterday,” she said. “You need\nto read it, Michel. It’s the kind of truth you need to hear.”\n“Who?” he asked angrily. “What young man?”\nHis mother took half a step back, staring at him in shock, then raising\nher chin. “Don’t think I’m going to tell you. I’m trying to help you now, and\nyou need to listen to me for once. This pamphlet —”\n“I know all about this pamphlet,” Michel said, shoving it in his pocket\nand pushing her farther into the alley. He whispered urgently. “Mother, you\ncan’t be seen with one of these. They’re cracking down on this very thing\nright now, and if they find one on you, they might…”\n“They might what? Throw an old woman in prison?”\n“They might!”\n“Let them,” she snapped. “I’m not the bumbling old fool you take me\nfor. Your father and I protested the Kez in Little Starland. I loaded muskets\nfor the Thirteenth during the war. I can handle prison.”"

Worried that your\nold mom might ruin your chance of advancement?”\n“Yes!” Michel hissed.\n“Good! I don’t want you advancing through that damned viper’s nest\nanyway.”\nMichel gave an exasperated sigh and paced to the mouth of the alley\nand then back again. They’d had this same fight a dozen times, and it\nalways came back to this. He’d try to keep her quiet, she’d threaten to\npurposefully tank his career, and then he’d avoid her for a couple of months\nand she’d go back to her reading.\n“Did the handyman come around?” he asked gently.\n“Hmph,” she replied. “He did. I don’t want you using Blackhat money\nto fix up my house.”\nMichel stopped, staring at her. “Your roof was leaking.”\n“I can handle a leak.”\n“It was destroying your books,” he tried.\n“I’ll get more.”\n“You’re being obstinate, Mother.”\n“I don’t care. Blackhat money is soaked with the blood of my people.\nOur people.”\n“You’re only half-Palo, Mother.”\n“And I’m proud of that half!”\nMichel paced back and forth, starting half a dozen sentences in his head\nand stopping each one before he said something hurtful. He finally took\nSins of Empire out of his pocket and showed it to her. “Please, Mother, just\ndo me a favor and avoid this particular pamphlet. It’s not going to do\nanyone any good if the Iron Roses pick you up in a sweep.” She\nharrumphed again, which was about as good an answer as he was going to\nget. Michel opened his mouth when he caught sight of the clerk from the\nbookstore peering around the corner. “What is it?”\n“Sir,” the clerk said, “your books are ready.” He handed Michel a neatly\nwrapped package. Michel looked at the package in his hands, then at his\nmother.\n“These are for you,” he said softly.\nHis mother took the package. She could feel the weight of them, and he\ncould tell by her face that she knew instantly what they were. He wondered\nwhen the last time she’d been able to afford leather-bound books was. She\nhanded them back.\n“I won’t take books bought with Blackhat money,” she said.\nMichel wanted to shake her. “Just take them, Mother.”\n“No!”\nThe clerk gave a little cough, clearly embarrassed, and Michel turned on\nthe poor man instead. “You,” he said. “I want you to make sure she never\npays for another book here. Understand? I’m going to check, and if I find\nout you’ve been charging her for even a single penny novel, I’ll burn this\ndamned place down.”\nThe clerk’s eyes grew wide, and Michel heard his mother’s gasp as he\nstrode from the alley. He tossed the package of leather-bound books onto a\ntable and strode down the street, looking for the closest hackney cab. He\nwas two blocks away before he found one and was soon inside, riding in\nwelcome silence toward the Millinery."

With the money she spent on\npenny novels, it was likely all she would have to eat for the next few days.\nHe swore at himself and almost yelled for the driver to turn around.\nOne thought stayed him.\nShe’d gotten a copy of Sins of Empire. Not a week ago, but yesterday.\nThe Iron Roses were meant to have rounded most of them up. Even if this\nwas one young revolutionary who’d managed to hide a few stacks of the\npamphlet, the fact that they were still being handed out could mean\nsomething. It could mean that they were still being printed.\nBut by whom? And where?\nMichel climbed out of the cab at the Millinery and paid the driver extra\nto go pick up a basket of bread and deliver it to his mother’s address. Inside,\nhe found Agent Warsim at his desk in the corner, and tapped him on the\nshoulder.\n“You busy?”\n“No, sir.”\n“Good. I need you to make me a list of every printer in the city.

May I ask why?”\n“Because I have just one idea, and I’m going to search every printing\npress from here to Redstone until I have a better one.”\nCHAPTER 24\nS\ntyke broke his fast with an iced coffee and a thumb-sized piece of\nhorngum just a few short hours after his late-night discussion with Olem\nand Vlora. He sat at a Palo-owned café on the northwestern side of the\nplateau – a prime spot on the ledge overlooking the Hadshaw River.\nScarcely two paces and a handrail separated him and Celine from a\nhundred-and-fifty-foot sheer drop to the gently sloped foot of the plateau,\nthen another fifty down to the floodplains on the bank of the Hadshaw\nwhere squat, wooden tenements sat upon stilts driven deep into the earth.\nThe land around the plateau that had once been nutrient-rich fields\nplowed by Kressian farmers was now suburbs of these stilted, flood-\nresistant tenements stretching for miles into the distance.

It made him feel like\na stranger in his own city.\nCeline stood at the railing, watching the people far below mill about the\nstreets like ants, and swinging herself back and forth.

His sleep\nhad been restless last night, listening to Celine snore while the feather\nmattress, an unheard-of luxury for so long, felt lumpy and uneven beneath\nhis back. As hard as he tried to keep his head down and just do his job, he\ncouldn’t help but wonder who had tried to kill Lady Flint, and what\nTampo’s ultimate interest in her was. Styke had never managed to be a blind\nfollower – even back during the war he’d ignored half his orders – and\nplaying by the rules now irked him like an ill-fitting saddle.\n“What kind is that?” Celine asked, pointing.\nStyke glanced over the edge, following Celine’s finger to see a spotted\nhorse far below them being led along the streets by its owner. “Palo\nHotblood,” he said.\n“It looks the same as any other,” Celine said, shooting him a suspicious\nlook.\n“The markings are Palo. Kressian horses rarely have that coloration.\nLook at the strong conformation, the hindquarters, the arched neck. That’s a\nhorse bred for agility and speed. Very sure-footed in the swamps and dense\nforests. Probably being brought into town for an auction. The roads down\non the floodplain are soft, and the keeper is walking ahead so as not to risk\na broken leg.”\nCeline pointed to another horse farther down the road, pulling one of the\nlighter, open-aired hackney cabs that were popular down there. “And that\none?”\n“Starlish Trunsin,” Styke said. “Standard Kressian carriage horse. They\ncut the tail short to keep it from getting caught in the carriage, and in\nStarland they used to make wigs for the nobility out of it. Probably itched\nlike a hat full of fleas, but there’s no accounting for taste among rich\npeople.”\nCeline pointed out almost two dozen more horses as Styke worked\nthrough a second cup of iced coffee, obliging her by naming the breed – or\nlikely mix of breeds – and a few characteristics of each. He found the\nexercise relaxing, and the realization that he hadn’t lost his touch even after\nten years of rarely seeing anything but the old, worn-out mares they worked\nto death in the fens left him feeling pleased with himself.\nHe had just begun to smile, the horngum doing its work on his sore\nmuscles, when a voice behind him said, “You know a lot about horses, Mr.\nStyke.”\nStyke turned in his seat to find Gregious Tampo standing a few feet\nback, top hat on his head, leaning on his cane. He looked like he’d been\nthere for more than just a few moments, and Styke was annoyed he’d let\nanyone sneak up on him like that. “Had a few in my time,” he said.\n“You were a lancer. I’d imagine that was part of the job.”\n“You could say that. It’s hard to find horses strong enough for a\nprolonged charge in plate armor. I had to keep my eye out all the time.”\nTampo looked out over the floodplains, eyes squinted as if he could see\nall the way to the Tristan Basin. “I remember that horse you rode during the"

Biggest damn stallion I’ve ever seen.”\nStyke felt a pang of regret, picturing the big, black warhorse in his\nmind’s eye. “Deshner,” he said. “He was a Deliv draft horse. Mean bastard,\nbut we got along well.” And some damn officer put a bullet in his head right\nbefore they put me up against the wall, just to spite me. Styke fought down\na surge of anger. He gripped his coffee cup and forced a smile. “Afternoon,\nMr. Tampo. What can I help you with?”\n“Good afternoon, Mr. Tampo,” Celine echoed without turning away\nfrom the ledge.\n“May I sit?” Tampo asked.\nStyke gestured to Celine’s unoccupied chair. Tampo took a seat and\nremained silent for several moments, studying Styke’s face with an\nuncomfortable intensity. Styke studied right back, searching Tampo for any\nkind of a tell. What was his game here? What did he want with Lady Flint?\nStyke felt a surge of protectiveness for Flint and reminded himself he’d\nknown her only for a few days and would more than likely end up having to\nkill her. She seemed a good officer – but Tampo had earned his loyalty by\nbringing him out of the labor camp.\n“What happened last night?” Tampo asked. There was a hint of\naccusation in his voice, and Styke suspected he already knew about the\nattack on Lady Flint.\nHow he knew was another question. “Someone tried to kill Flint.”\n“I know. I trust you were there to protect her?”\n“I wasn’t,” Styke said. No point in lying. Lying, in either the camps or\nthe army, rarely made Styke’s job easier. It just gave him one more thing he\nhad to remember. “Not until the end.”\n“And why not?” Definitely accusatory. “I told you I needed her alive.”\nStyke shrugged. “You said you wanted me to get close to her. She’s\ngiven me a task to do to get in her good graces. I’m not in the position to\ndemand that she make me her bodyguard. Might be a bit suspicious if I did.\nBesides, from everything I’ve seen she can take care of herself pretty damn\nwell.” Tampo remained silent, twirling his cane absently where it lay across\nhis knee. Styke continued: “I half-expected you to be behind the\nassassination attempt, to be honest.”\nTo his surprise, Tampo smiled at that. “I appreciate the concern, but you\nare my plan regarding Lady Flint. She has powerful enemies in Landfall\nwithout even knowing it, and she may wind up being very useful to me in\nthe future. I want her alive.”\nNow that was interesting. Styke wondered what kind of people had it\nout for a mercenary general. “And if she proves not to be useful?”\n“Then I’ll have you take care of the problem.” Tampo hesitated. “Tell\nme, Mr. Styke, do you think you could kill a powder mage?”\nCeline left her spot at the railing and came over and pulled herself onto"

    "text": "me, Mr. Styke, do you think you could kill a powder mage?”\nCeline left her spot at the railing and came over and pulled herself onto\nStyke’s knee, fixing Tampo with a flat stare. “Ben can kill anyone.\nYesterday, he killed three Palo without breaking a sweat.”\n“Is that so?” Tampo tilted his head at Styke, looking from him to Celine\nwith some significance.\n“Some Palo kid got in the way of a job I was doing,” Styke explained.\n“And Celine will keep her mouth shut around Lady Flint. Won’t you,\nCeline?”\nCeline folded her arms. “I like Lady Flint. But if Ben has to kill her,\nthen…” She held her hands up as if to say “oh well!”\n“Regular old pair of mercenaries here,” Tampo commented. “Well, Mr.\nStyke, I’ll ask again. Could you kill a powder mage?”\nStyke considered the question for a few moments. “In my current state?\nNot in a fair fight. But I don’t have a problem with fighting dirty. I’d\nprobably be more worried about making my escape after killing Flint. I’d\nhave to kill Colonel Olem, too, or risk him hunting me down, and those\ninfantry seem pretty close to her, so it might get rough.”\n“I’m glad you’re making plans for the eventuality, though I hope it does\nnot come to that.”\nThere seemed to be a genuine note of regret in Tampo’s voice, and\nStyke wondered whether he was as cold a killer as Styke had originally\npegged him to be. “Do I have a place in your plans?” Styke asked. “Beyond\nthis thing with Lady Flint?”\n“You’re a killer, Mr. Styke,” Tampo said matter-of-factly. “I always\nhave use for a killer. Why do you ask?”\n“Just wondering,” Styke said, giving Tampo a tight smile. “Planning for\neventualities.”\nTampo sucked on his teeth, eyes narrowed, and returned to studying\nStyke in silence. Styke had to admit to himself that there was something\nunsettling in that gaze. Finally, Tampo said, “You’re too clever, Mr. Styke. I\nthink that’s why they put you in the labor camp. You look like a thug, kill\nlike a thug, but you think and talk like an officer. It confuses people – the\nlooks and reputation give them expectations, and then you defy them all by\nbeing educated.”\n“Are you saying you regret plucking me from the labor camps?” Styke\ntensed. He did not particularly like Tampo, but Tampo had bought his\nloyalty along with his freedom. He would do nothing from his own end to\njeopardize their relationship, but if Tampo turned on them Styke would gut\nhim like a pig.\nThe smile Tampo shot back was actually warm. “On the contrary. I’ve\ngotten exactly what I was looking for.”\n“I thought you told me you wanted a blunt instrument.”\n“Ever seen an old-fashioned war hammer? They put a spike on the back\nfor a reason.” Tampo turned his attention suddenly to Celine, frowning,\nlifting the back of her hair gently to expose the red marks the dragonman\nhad left on her neck. He gave Styke a sharp look."

    "text": "for a reason.” Tampo turned his attention suddenly to Celine, frowning,\nlifting the back of her hair gently to expose the red marks the dragonman\nhad left on her neck. He gave Styke a sharp look.\n“We ran into some trouble,” Styke said.\n“What kind of trouble?”\n“It was a dragonman,” Celine interjected, wiggling out of Styke’s lap\nand returning to the railing. “He grabbed me by the neck, but Ben punched\nhim in the face and took his knife.”\nTampo’s head jerked around. There was a tense moment of silence, all\nof the congeniality having gone out of Tampo. “Did you say a dragonman?”\nhe asked quietly.\n“She did,” Styke answered.\n“You saw one – you fought one?”\n“More of a scuffle than a fight,” Styke said, glancing at Celine. This\nwas not something he wanted to discuss with Tampo right now. “I tried to\ndraw him out, he sent some of his acolytes to get a feel for me, then he\nslipped away. Celine and I followed him across the city and there was a\nconfrontation.”\nTampo leaned across the table. Styke scooted his chair back slightly, not\nentirely sure what was eliciting Tampo’s intense response. Tampo said,\n“Back up and tell me everything.”\nStyke ran through Lady Flint’s initial encounter with the dragonman in\nthe Tristan Basin, her assignment, and then Styke’s plan to get one to show\nhis face. He told Tampo about following the dragonman through the city\nand, at Tampo’s urging, listed all the places that the dragonman had visited\non his errands. He finished with the scuffle, saying, “He ran when he saw\nthe crowd. I suspect he’s not eager to attract the wrong kind of attention.”\n“And you’re sure he was a dragonman?”\n“Same kind of black tattoos I’ve read about in the stories. Hard bastard,\ntoo. The only difference is… well, from the old stories you think of\nbackwoods warriors straight out of the swamp.”\n“He wasn’t?” Tampo asked.\n“Too urbane. Wore a tailored suit, navigated the streets with ease.\nAnother reason I think he was a Dynize, beyond the accent – he had the city\nwritten all over him and the only cities one might see a dragonman as\ncommonplace these days are in Dynize.”\n“Agreed,” Tampo said. “Palo dragonmen no longer exist. I knew the\nDynize were scouting Landfall, but a dragonman…”\nCeline swung just a little too far out on the railing, her feet slipping, and\nStyke snatched her by the back of the shirt and pulled her back without\ntaking his eyes off Tampo. “Wait. You knew the Dynize were in Landfall?\nDoes Lady Flint know that? Do the Blackhats know?”\n“I can’t think of a reason she’d keep it a secret if she knew.” Tampo\nclicked his tongue, his expression annoyed, as if he’d let something slip that\nhe hadn’t meant to. “I’m not sure if the Blackhats know. They may have\ntheir suspicions, but… this isn’t information you need to know.” He held up"

    "text": "he hadn’t meant to. “I’m not sure if the Blackhats know. They may have\ntheir suspicions, but… this isn’t information you need to know.” He held up\na hand to forestall Styke’s protest. “It’s not that I don’t think you can keep a\nsecret, but rather that the more people who are aware of the Dynize, the\ngreater chance they will disappear without a trace. They have proved, like\nyour dragonman, to be skittish when made the center of attention.”\nThis bit about Tampo already knowing about the Dynize made Styke\nreturn to his earlier question: What did Tampo want? It seemed that Lady\nFlint was only a small piece in a larger scheme, rather than the focus of his\nattentions. He had a stake in Landfall, though whether he was a\nrevolutionary, a wannabe usurper, or simply a power broker of some kind,\nStyke could not guess. He was well connected and wealthy enough to know\nwhat was going on in Greenfire Depths and to get Styke released from\nLindet’s labor camps. That meant something.\nTampo gestured vaguely, as if to himself, and said, “Never mind all that.\nI want you to focus on Lady Flint for now. Track down this dragonman and\nget Flint her answers – I’ll want to hear them as well – but try to stay as\nclose to her as possible. She needs to stay alive for at least the next few\nmonths.”\n“Until?”\n“Until I know if she’ll be a help or a hindrance.”\n“You wouldn’t happen to know where a dragonman might be hiding,\nwould you?” Styke asked. “It would sure make my job easier.”\n“Unfortunately, I do not. You’re on your own for now, but I’ll pass on\nanything I can discover.” Tampo got to his feet, gently brushing Celine’s\nhair off the back of her neck to examine the red markings again. “Stay close\nto Mr. Styke,” he told Celine. “The man who did that to you won’t hesitate\nto go further if he catches you alone.”\n“Yes, Mr. Tampo.”\nStyke wondered if Tampo actually cared, or whether he was worried\nStyke wouldn’t be able to focus if something happened to Celine. Tampo\nwas right to worry, but the question intrigued Styke.\n“One more thing,” Tampo said as he turned to go. He held out a roll of\nbanknotes. “Fidelis Jes knows that you’ve been released.”\nStyke twirled the ring on his finger, feeling along the lance with his\nthumb. Fidelis Jes could certainly complicate things. “How?”\n“Seems one of the guards I bribed had instructions to let Fidelis Jes\nknow if you happened to get out for any reason. We could do without the\nattention, but no helping it now, unfortunately.”\nStyke couldn’t help but agree. He was already looking over his shoulder\nfor this dragonman to come calling – now he had to figure out a way to\nnavigate the streets without attracting the attention of the Blackhats. He was\ngoing to have to start taking hackney cabs everywhere. But something else\nwas bothering him. “You have people in the Blackhats?”\n“Local police, actually,” Tampo said with a faint smile. “Seems Fidelis"

    "text": "was bothering him. “You have people in the Blackhats?”\n“Local police, actually,” Tampo said with a faint smile. “Seems Fidelis\nJes has alerted most of the authorities that you’re a mass-murdering war\ncriminal that must be apprehended.”\nStyke felt a stab of anger. Being accused of being a murderer didn’t faze\nhim. But a war criminal? That was preposterous. “Does that amuse you?”\nhe asked.\n“A little,” Tampo said. “I expect you to go ahead with your work. Just\nbe warned that Fidelis Jes is coming for you. You’ll want to keep a low\nprofile.”\n“I’ll be ready for it when he does,” Styke said. He made a fist,\nimagining that it was around Fidelis Jes’s throat. “If Flint finds out she’ll\nhand me over without a fuss.”\nTampo’s smile broadened. “The garrisons haven’t been told, so I suspect\nLady Flint will not find out for some time. You probably have a week or\ntwo to make yourself indispensable. Once you do that – once you’re one of\nher men – she won’t let Fidelis Jes walk away with you.” Tampo nodded to\nhimself, as if satisfied with the meeting, and then turned and left the café as\nsuddenly as he’d arrived.\nStyke looked down at his third cup of coffee, the ice long melted, and\nthen over at Celine. She was watching Tampo go, eyes sharp, and it struck\nhim that she saw and heard more than most children her age. Good. It might\njust keep her alive to reach adulthood. Styke stood up, paid his bill, and\ntook Celine by the hand. If Fidelis Jes knew he was out, he would stop at\nnothing to catch him. That meant looking in on old friends. Styke didn’t\nhave a lot of those left, so he thought it best he give them some warning.\nCHAPTER 25\nV\nlora woke to the sound of a violent row outside the Loel’s Fort staff\nroom. She bolted upright, blinking sleep out of her eyes and fumbling\nfor her pistol, only for the door to burst inward. She lunged for the sword\nbeneath her cot but was snatched up by strong hands, lifted bodily to her\nfeet, and thrust into the light of the single window in the center of the room.\n“What the pit…” Vlora struggled, only to suddenly find herself free.\nShe nearly collapsed, but managed to keep her balance, blinking at the big,\nbearded face in front of her. “Vallencian? What are you doing here? By\nAdom, Vallencian, I’m not dressed!”\nThe Ice Baron shushed her loudly and spun her around, examining her\nbody in a way that might have been horrifying if it wasn’t so clinical. Vlora\ntried to come to grips with what was happening, a hangover and far too\nlittle sleep keeping her head fuzzy. If there wasn’t a good reason for this,\nshe was going to kill him.\n“Ach!” Vallencian exclaimed, snatching up Vlora’s clothes from the\nchair she’d thrown them on last night and thrusting them into her hands. He\nturned away, as if suddenly embarrassed, his cheeks turning red, and began"

He\nturned away, as if suddenly embarrassed, his cheeks turning red, and began\nto pace furiously from one end of the room to the other as Vlora dressed. “I\nam sorry for this intrusion, Lady Flint, but I simply had to see that you were\nunharmed with my own eyes. If they had damaged a single hair on your\nhead…” He let out a strangled exclamation.\nVlora’s own anger died out as she managed to clear the sleep from her\nhead and saw that Vallencian was physically trembling, his hands balled\ninto fists, tears streaming down his face. “Vallencian? Are you all right?”\n“My idiot footman waited until I awoke to give me your message, so I\nhave just now found out you were attacked last night on your way home\nfrom the gala.”\n“Vallencian, calm down, or you’ll give yourself apoplexy.”\n“You could have been killed!”\nVlora staggered over to the table, where she counted eight empty wine\nbottles. For who? Her, Olem, and Styke? Considering how hard it was for a\npowder mage to get a true hangover, most of that had gone in her. Pit, it was\ngoing to be a rough day. “I wasn’t. I wasn’t even hurt.”\n“Incredible. A testament to your skill, and to the favor of the god of\nyour choosing. But Lady Flint, you were under my protection. You are my\nfriend. I am mortified, and I hope you will accept any gift that is in my\npower to give.”\nVallencian’s solemn face, and perhaps a little leftover alcohol in her\nsystem, made Vlora giggle. She covered her mouth, mortified that such an\nun-general-like sound would come from her. Vallencian scowled. “I’m\nsorry,” she said. “I’m so sorry, it’s just… I’ve had so many people try to kill\nme. Vallencian, your apology is completely unneeded. I don’t blame you in\nany way for what happened.”\n“I don’t care! I blame myself.” He looked away, brushed tears off his\ncheeks with his bearskin. “You could have been hurt, and I did lose another\nfriend last night.”\nVlora sobered up. “Devin-Tallis. His family…”\n“They will want for nothing!” Vallencian declared. “His widow will be\na countess! His children will attend the finest schools! I am not…” He\nchoked on his words.\nVlora’s cheeks burned with embarrassment. She’d never seen someone\nwith so much passion before. For the first time she noticed a few of her\nsoldiers standing just outside the door and shooed them away, wondering if\nthey’d gotten an eyeful before she’d dressed. Oh well. No helping that now.\nVlora stuck her head out the door. “Olem! Olem! Someone get the colonel,\nwould you?”\n“I’m right here.” Olem rounded the corner at a jog, hand on the hilt of\nhis sword. “Are you all right?”\nVlora jerked her head at Vallencian, who stood with his face toward the\ncorner of the staff room, weeping openly. “Better than him,” she muttered."

What’s going\non?”\n“He claims he feels responsible for the attack on me last night, and the\ndeath of my guide. Pit, I can’t…” She was cut off by an enormous crash.\nThe sound made her jump, and she checked the window to find a cloud of\ndust riding over the walls of the fort. “What’s going on?”\n“The boys are taking down the first tenement,” Olem answered.\n“That was this morning? Pit, you need to remind me not to drink so\nmuch.”\nOlem cocked an eyebrow at her. “And I need to remind you what\nhappens when I remind you of things.”\n“I only punched you in the face that one time.”\n“Twice, actually.”\n“I said I was sorry.” Vlora looked over her shoulder at Vallencian, who\nseemed to be getting himself under control. “Can you… ?” she said to\nOlem.\nOlem pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket. “Vallencian,” he said,\n“you wouldn’t happen to have any more of those cigarettes?” The Ice Baron\nblew his nose loudly, and within moments the two of them were smoking\nup a storm in the corner of the staff room. Vlora stepped outside to get some\nfresh air, choked on the drifting dust from the demolition project the next\nblock over, and went back inside.\nBy the time they finished their cigarettes, Vallencian seemed like his old\nself. He thumped Olem on the back and gave Vlora a sheepish look. “I am\nvery sorry,” he said. “I am known to get overly… protective of my friends.”\n“No need for the apology,” Vlora said, realizing the irony that she had\nbeen the one attacked last night and he was the one in tears. “Vallencian, I\ndo need something, though. Those assassins weren’t there on their own\nvolition, I’d stake my reputation on it. We need to know who had them\nwaiting for me, and why, but the Riflejacks don’t have the contacts in the\ncity, and especially not in Greenfire Depths.”\nVallencian discarded his spent cigarette and immediately produced his\npipe, puffing it to life in moments. “I’m not sure I’ll be much help in the\nDepths. But I can try. I’ll give you all of my resources to discover who did\nthis thing.”\n“Just a little help is all we ask.”\n“Nonsense! I may not have guile, but I have money and I know how to\nmake it work for me. I’ll find out who tried to have you killed, Lady Flint, I\nswear it. It’s the least I could do for this mess that I’ve made of your room\nand for seeing you, um…” He cleared his throat.\n“Let’s forget that happened,” Vlora suggested. She leaned over to Olem\nand whispered, “You need to remind me to get dressed after we…”\nOlem chuckled. “Not a chance,” he said under his breath.\n“I will put pressure on my business partners to find answers for me,”"

The Palo love their iced coffee.”\n“You don’t have to put your business at risk,” Vlora assured him. “One\nother thing, though. Can you tell me anything about Meln-Dun? I spent\nquite a lot of time with him last night, and he seems eager to help me make\nfriends in the Depths. Does he have a good reputation?”\nVallencian considered the question for a moment. “He does, more or\nless. He owns one of the few remaining operating quarries in the city, and\nseveral hundred homes in Greenfire Depths.”\n“He’s a landlord?”\n“He is. Always buying up what he can from any Palo who go into debt.\nHe’s fair, though. Always gives them a chance to get back on their feet.”\n“I’m surprised that anyone owns anything down there,” Olem said.\nVallencian shook his pipe at Olem. “Property is taken very seriously in\nthe Depths! Most of the Palo own their apartments. It’s a point of pride. I’ve\ntried to tell you, leave your expectations behind when it comes to the Palo!\nMeln-Dun, though…” He gave a shrug. “He’s ambitious, but most seem to\nlike him.”\nA landlord, with obvious plans to expand his holdings. That would\nexplain why he wanted Vlora’s help rebuilding a chunk of the Depths.\nBrand-new tenements would end up being prime real estate, and he’d no\ndoubt put them in his pocket by the time construction was done. Vlora\nwondered how Meln-Dun’s business came into play with Mama Palo’s\nmaneuvering against Lindet. Perhaps it didn’t. Either way, it was something\nVlora could use to infiltrate the Depths.\n“About his partner,” Vlora said.\n“Lady Enna?”\n“Yes, her. You may want to pass on a friendly warning. I’m not terribly\ninterested in the politics of the city, but it’s dangerous to be so loudly liberal\nin a place like Landfall.”\nVallencian grimaced. “I know. I’ve tried, believe me. Lady Enna is a\nsharp woman, but a little bit of wine in her brings out a bleeding heart.\nMeln-Dun does his best to make sure she doesn’t go to parties that aren’t\npredominantly attended by people who either agree with her or are\nambivalent. My apologies for leaving you with her – though you did seem\nto get along fine.”\n“Yes,” Vlora said, drawing out the word. The events of last night were\ncoming back to her with more clarity as she gathered her wits. “One last\nquestion. Do you know someone named Gregious Tampo? He’s a lawyer.”\nVallencian’s face brightened. “I do! Gregious runs a small mill out\nbeyond the fens. Lovely man, very friendly.”\n“A mill?” Vlora searched her pockets and came up with Tampo’s card,\nhanding it to Vallencian. “He said he owned a printing press.”"

Lovely man, very friendly.”\n“A mill?” Vlora searched her pockets and came up with Tampo’s card,\nhanding it to Vallencian. “He said he owned a printing press.”\n“First I’ve heard of it,” Vallencian said. “He’s only been around\nLandfall for a few months but he seems to be in Mama Palo’s good graces. I\nunderstand he’s going to set up a law firm in the city once he’s raised the\nfunds. I do hope he finds success.”\nVlora decided not to tell Vallencian about her interactions with Tampo.\nShe didn’t need another passionate speech, or for him to rush off half-\ncocked. Getting him to focus on finding whoever hired those assassins was\nthe most important thing. She paused that thought, suddenly recalling a\nwarning Tampo had given her before leaving. Beware the Depths, he’d said.\nIt had sounded vaguely sinister at the time, and she wondered whether he\nhad anything to do with the attempt on her life.\nVlora jumped at a sudden boom, and then the following, prolonged\ncrash. She reached for a sword that was not at her hip.\n“The second tenement,” Olem explained. “The engineers decided to\ntake them both down today.”\n“Could have warned me. Vallencian, thank you so much for checking on\nme. I need to get to work but please, do not disrupt your business on my\naccount.”\nVallencian waved off her protestation and stalked toward the door. “I\nwill discover who hired your assassins, Lady Flint. I will also try to recover\nDevin-Tallis’s body. It’s Greenfire Depths, so the scene of your attack is\nprobably already cleaned up, but I will still try.” He turned, flourishing a\nbow. “For now, good afternoon!” He was gone a moment later, and Vlora\nlet out a sigh of relief.\nShe ran her hands through her hair. “Is it really afternoon already?”\n“One fifteen,” Olem reported.\nShe mentally sorted through the long list of things she needed to get\ndone, filing them in order of importance. She knew she should feel elation\nat the success she’d had last night at the gala, but the assassination attempt\nafter left her wondering if this was all a terrible idea. She was getting mixed\nup in the petty politics of a slum exactly like she’d promised herself she\nwouldn’t. “Let Agent Bravis know that I’m making progress,” she told\nOlem. “But also tell him I’m going to need resources and permission to\nbuild in Greenfire Depths. Then set up a meeting with Meln-Dun. And,” she\nsaid, handing him Tampo’s card, “look into this. Find out who this guy is.\nHe gave me the creeps.”\nCHAPTER 26\nT\nhe Fles family home in Greenfire Depths had not changed much since\nStyke’s last visit. It was located at the bottom of the quarry near the\nGreenfire Inlet, where the Hadshaw River Gorge and the Depths connected\nin a narrow corridor that allowed immense blocks of limestone to be floated\nup or down the Hadshaw River by barge.

    "text": "up or down the Hadshaw River by barge. The house was an old stone\nmanor, one of the few single homes left in the Depths, facing the inlet in\nsuch a way that it actually received a bit of sunlight every day. When Styke\napproached that time was well past, and the manor was cloaked in shadow.\nStyke had expected the Fles family home to be a ruin by now, what with\nthe current reputation of the Depths, but the street outside was devoid of the\nusual quarry grime, the stone facade of the house scrubbed clean. The big\nwooden sign that used to hang over the door declaring it FLES FINE\nBLADES had been replaced with a small bronze placard that said:\nFLES FAMILY HOME\nFOR BLADES SEE FLES AND FLES\nAT HADSHAW MARKET\nStyke watched the house for a few minutes while Celine did a circuit of\nthe neighborhood to see if the Blackhats had managed to beat him here. He\nnoted that the inlet was busy with Palo workers loading stone on barges,\nand there were truncheon-wielding Palo in pale green uniforms at regular\nintervals up and down the street. A Palo police force. He snorted. They\nreally had taken charge of the Depths.\nCeline returned, shaking her head. The Blackhats hadn’t left anyone to\nwatch the Fles home – at least anyone obvious – and Styke took that as a\ngood sign. He went around to the side door, finding the spare key in the\nfalse knot halfway up the frame, and let himself and Celine into the old\nworkshop.\nMost of the manor had long ago been converted into a smithy for Fles’s\nbusiness, and then allowed to gather dust when the smithy moved to\nHadshaw Market. The forge was now dark, the rooms quiet. Styke guided\nCeline through the dim light of the old smithy by memory until he reached\nthe heavy oak door that separated the Fles home from the workshop. The\ndoor stuck, forcing him to put his shoulder against it, and he pushed his way\ninside.\nThe “home” portion of the manor contained several large rooms that all\nseemed to lead into one another, from the foyer, to the great hall, to the\nkitchen and larder. The mix of smells hit him first – the smoky scent left in\nclothes after all day at the forge, the corn oil and lime mix they used to rub\nthe blades. Styke felt himself transported back twenty years, to a time when\nhe was young and stupid, and without direction, hanging around the forge\nall day to flirt with Ibana while Fles worked his blades in the next room.\nThere was still the old ironwood chair by the front door, atop the striped\nhide of a swamp-cat rug now worn thin.\nStyke thrust aside all his old memories and stalked through the great\nroom to the kitchen, following the smell of a woodstove and the whistle of a\nteakettle. He found Old Man Fles leaning against the counter beside the\nstove, snoring quietly, asleep on his feet.\nCeline poked him gently. Fles stirred, swatting at an invisible fly, but\ncontinued to snore. “Why do old people sleep so much?” she asked.\n“Fles has always been a napper,” Styke said, taking the teakettle off the"

Fles!”\nOld Man Fles jerked awake, nearly falling over. “I’m up! I…” He\nblinked and seemed to remember where he was before glancing from Styke\nto Celine. “What are you two doing here?”\n“You said you didn’t want me coming by the market,” Styke answered.\nFles rubbed his eyes, stretched, then snatched the teakettle out of\nStyke’s hand and poured himself a cup. He didn’t offer any to Styke or\nCeline. “Right, right,” he said, sniffing. “Surprised you’re still alive.\nThought the new city would eat you up by now.”\n“I’m a cripple, not an invalid,” Styke said, growling. Bloody old man\nalways liked to bait him.\n“I hear you messed up a bar full of Palo kids up on the Rim.”\nFirst Olem, now Old Man Fles. “Word’s getting around, huh?”\n“Sure is.” Fles poked Styke in the stomach with one bony finger.\n“Ow.”\n“Ow, nothing. You need to harden up, boy. The Blackhats are looking\nfor you.”\n“I know.”\nFles raised his eyebrows. “You know? Well look at you, getting your\ninformation before Old Man Fles. I just found out half an hour ago.”\n“They come by the market?” Styke asked, unable to keep the worry\nfrom his voice.\nFles waved him off. “Nah.”\n“Here?”\n“Not yet. I fired up some of my old contacts this week. Turns out the\nBlackhats are quietly asking around about you. Nothing overt – nothing that\ngives away your name. Just telling people to be on the lookout for a scarred\ngiant.”\nStyke nodded, feeling more than a little relieved. Maybe the Blackhats\nhad forgotten about Styke’s relationship with the Fles family. Not likely, but\nhe could always hope. They hadn’t started roughing up his old friends yet,\nat least.\n“Don’t touch that!” Fles said, swatting Celine’s hand away from a knife\non the counter. “You’ll cut your damn fingers off.”\n“I can handle a knife,” Celine said, sticking her bottom lip out at Fles.\n“I keep mine sharp enough to shave with.” Fles turned his attention\nback to Styke. “Boy, what happened with those Palo kids up at Mama\nSender’s? That’s the place you had me setting up the meeting, isn’t it? You\nreally had to kill ’em?”\n“Didn’t want to,” Styke replied. His initial feeling of joy at being back\nin the Fles home had soured, and he found himself scowling back at Fles.\nEveryone, even his friends, always assumed he enjoyed killing. Which he\ndid, sometimes. But the assumption still hurt a little. “Damned kids came\nlooking for a fight.”\n“Well, did you at least get the information you wanted? You find\nyourself a dragonman?”\n“I did, actually.”\n“No kidding. What did he look like?”"

What did he look like?”\n“Like a Palo, but with black tattoos on his neck and arms.” Styke\nreached to the sheath on the back of his belt and took out the dragonman’s\nknife. “What do you think of this?”\nFles gave a low whistle and set down his tea to take up the blade. He\nhandled it gingerly, turning it over and over again in his hands before taking\nit by the grip and giving a few experimental stabs. “Haven’t seen one of\nthese since I was a kid. Damn, would you look at that workmanship?” He\nheld the blade up in front of his eyes, squinting at it for several moments.\n“Sharp as steel. There’s sorcery in this knife. Lots of blood on it, too.”\nStyke didn’t think there was any sorcery in the knife – his Knack would\nhave sensed it – but one didn’t argue with Fles when it came to blades.\nReluctantly, Fles handed the knife back to Styke. “Lots of stories around\nthose weapons. Lots of history.”\n“Like?”\n“Well, a dragonman’s weapons are all made out of the bones of the\nswamp dragons they killed. That knife is from a back leg, I’d wager, but the\naxes they carry are the real prizes – carved from the jawbones, one from the\ntop, one from the bottom. They say that each weapon is sanctified by a\nbone-eye, enchanted by a Privileged, and bathed in the blood of an\ninnocent. It’s probably all hogwash – Palo are a lot more civilized than\nwe’ve ever given them credit for, and they haven’t had their own Privileged\nfor hundreds of years. Even their bone-eyes are pretty rare.”\nStyke sheathed the blade. “This one is a Dynize, not a Palo.”\n“That’s preposterous. No one from the Empire has been seen here for\nover a hundred years.”\n“He was,” Styke insisted. “And someone I trust told me the Dynize\nhave been spotted in Landfall.” He wondered if he actually did trust Tampo.\nHe didn’t have a lot of choice, he decided.\nFles rubbed his chin, scowling. “I would have heard about Dynize in\ntown.”\n“So you don’t know anything about it?”\n“Not me.”\n“My source said that they were infiltrating Greenfire Depths, mixing in\nwith the Palo.”\n“No, no. Can’t be right.” The Old Man sipped his tea, then topped it off\nand added a lump of sugar. “If it’s true, and I’m not saying it is, the Palo\nmight know more. But you’ll need to ask one of them directly.”\n“That’s what I’ve got you for.”\nFles held up his hands. “My contacts got you a meeting with the\ndragonman. You missed your chance, and I have to live here. Palo favors\nare like gold, and you won’t be using another of mine.

    "text": "the Dynize could stir up a world of trouble.”\nStyke wondered if the Old Man was slipping. He’d already agreed to\ndig up information on the Blackhat grand master, but he wouldn’t chase a\nrumor down here with the Palo? Strange. “All right. Then I’ll ask. Who do I\ngo to?”\n“I think… no, not him. Not her.” Fles went through an invisible\nchecklist, talking to himself. “Definitely not her. Ah, got it. I’ll send you\nover to Henrick Jackal. Old friend of yours.”\nStyke’s mind was elsewhere, considering how he was going to approach\nthe Palo directly. He’d always been evenhanded in his dealing with the\nPalo, and they’d always seemed to respect him for it, but it had been a long\ntime. Those Palo kids and their dragonman overlord had proved that. He\nbrought his thoughts back to the present. “Wait. Did you say Henrick\nJackal?”\n“That’s what I said. I know you’re a cripple, but I didn’t think you were\ndeaf, too.”\nStyke held a hand up to his eyes. “About yay high. Missing an ear and a\npinkie?”\n“Yeah, that’s him. He’s some kind of Palo spiritualist now.”\n“No,” Styke said, snorting. “Not Mean Jackal.”\n“One and the same.”\nCeline tugged on Styke’s sleeve. “Who is Mean Jackal?”\n“Used to be one of my captains,” Styke answered thoughtfully. “He was\na founding member of the Mad Lancers, but was always a little crazy.\nDisemboweled the mayor of Little Starland for spitting on his shoe.”\nCeline’s eyes widened, and Styke frowned at the Old Man. “You’re sure\nHenrick Jackal is a spiritualist now? Is it some kind of a con?”\nFles shrugged. “Beats me. Heard he was the real deal. Teaches\nrunaways to talk to river spirits or some such shit. Even the other Palo think\nhe’s a kook, but he’s the only person who pays attention to the teenage\ncastoffs so he’s got his ear to the ground better than most.”\n“Well, I’ll be damned,” Styke said, searching his pocket for a bit of\nhorngum and tucking it into his cheek. “Never would have pegged Jackal\nfor getting religion.” Styke’s last memory of Jackal was watching him and\nIbana attempt to fight their way, bare-handed, through a line of military\npolice as their fellows led Styke up to the firing squad. He always figured\nIbana got away with it – she had a family name, after all. But Jackal was a\nviolent Palo, and Styke was surprised to hear he’d come out of that fight\nalive.\nOld Man Fles wrote down the address – or a list of directions, which\nwas as close to an address as one could get in the Depths – and handed it\nover. Styke tucked it in his pocket, gesturing to Celine toward the door.\n“When does Ibana get back?”\n“A week,” Fles answered. “Maybe two? Maybe less? Pit if you think I\nkeep track of that girl.

    "text": "“When does Ibana get back?”\n“A week,” Fles answered. “Maybe two? Maybe less? Pit if you think I\nkeep track of that girl. She’s always off making new deals, bringing on new\napprentices. Business head on her she got from her mother, but damn if I\ncan keep up with it. Why? You hoping for some warning before she comes\nback and pincushions you?”\n“Maybe,” Styke replied. He wasn’t quite sure himself. As much as he\nwanted to see Ibana, he knew it was going to hurt bad – both emotionally\nand physically.\n“Right, right. Don’t let the door hit you on the ass, et cetera,” Old Man\nFles said, waving them toward the foyer. “And go out the front. That\ndamned workshop door keeps sticking and I don’t want to deal with it\ntonight.”\n“Good-bye, Mr. Fles,” Celine said.\n“Bah!”\nStyke and Celine headed toward the front door. Styke paused for a\nmoment to look back at the great room, filled with a lifetime of\nknickknacks and furniture, a smile tugging at his ruined face. He opened the\ndoor behind him and turned toward the street.\nOnly to come face-to-face with a man in a black uniform, shirt buttoned\nup the left breast, truncheon and pistol at his belt. There were five more\ndressed identically just behind him, and the man in front had his hand raised\nas if he was just about to knock on the door. “Shit,” the Blackhat managed,\nright before Styke buried his knife in his chest.\nStyke shoved Celine back into the Fles house with one hand and twisted\nhis knife with the other. He lifted, charging forward, using the Blackhat’s\nbody as a shield as his companions drew their pistols. The crack of gunfire\nerupted around him and Styke felt the bullets thump into his unfortunate\nBlackhat battering ram. He pulled his knife out and threw the body, cutting\nsideways with a wide arc to open the throat of the woman on his left.\nA truncheon slammed across Styke’s left shoulder. He took a second\nblow, ignoring the pain that erupted from his arm, and punched the\nBlackhat holding the truncheon hard enough to lift him off his feet. Styke\ngrabbed the falling truncheon of another and brought his knife down hard,\nsevering the man’s hand at the wrist. He flipped the truncheon around,\nbloody hand and all, and slammed it across the face of its former owner,\nthen let go to draw the bone knife from his belt and bury it in the eye of the\nlast Blackhat.\nThe whole fight lasted less than twenty seconds. Styke’s chest rose and\nfell from the effort, and he bent to finish off two survivors before they had a\nchance to start screaming. He glanced up, noting the Palo policemen still\noverseeing the quarry down the street. The Palo stared at him, unmoving,\nand the street was silent.\n“By Kresimir, you made a damned bloody mess,” Fles said, sipping his\ntea in the doorway, holding a kitchen knife in one hand.

Some of the Palo down the street continued to\nstare, while others turned away. They saw the black uniforms and decided\nthis wasn’t their problem.\n“Quit your bellyaching,” Styke said, “and help me with these bodies.\nCeline, go get a bucket of water to clean up this blood. There should be\nsome lye above the stove.”\nFles sighed, downing his tea. “Friend with a pig farm owes me a favor,”\nhe muttered, “but we better move quick.”\nTwo hours later, Styke had changed his bloody clothes and disposed of the\nsix corpses. He walked into the only public post office remaining in\nGreenfire Depths and waited in line until he got to the front. A half-Palo,\nhalf-Rosvelean woman with brown, freckled skin greeted him. “Package or\nletter?” she asked.\n“Package,” Styke said. He opened his fist above the woman’s desk,\nletting six Iron Roses clatter onto the wood. “I need the mailing address for\nthe office of the grand master of the secret police.”\nCHAPTER 27\nM\nichel stood outside a printshop in Middle Heights, a large, upper-class\nborough right in the center of the Landfall Plateau. He ran his eyes\nover the file in his hand – a comprehensive list of every single printer, both\nindependent and government owned, in the entire city. “Huffin and Sons,\nHuffin and Sons,” he murmured, running his finger along the edge to try to\nkeep the letters from going in and out of focus. “Ah. Huffin and Sons.” He\nput a mark through the center of the name and let his hand drop, looking up\nat the sun in the eastern sky.\nHe checked his pocket watch to find that it was well past nine in the\nmorning and tried to remember if he’d slept. “No,” he said quietly, “I\ndefinitely haven’t slept for at least forty-eight hours now.”\n“You caught a few winks in that cab this morning,” he reminded\nhimself.\n“Oh, right.”\n“And another cab last night.”\n“Okay. So I’ve gotten a good two and a half hours of sleep in the last\nforty-eight. Fantastic. That’ll keep me on my feet all week.”\nHe ran a hand through his hair and noticed a nearby shopkeep staring at\nhim. “Probably shouldn’t talk to yourself in public, either, Michel.”\n“Oh, shut up.”\nHe flipped the shopkeep a wave and headed into the boulevard to catch\na hackney cab and was soon heading back to his office at the Millinery. He\nchecked his list again once he was inside. Two hundred and eighteen\nprinters in the greater Landfall area. He’d covered roughly half in just\ntwenty-four hours, which he found pretty damn impressive. But he hoped\nthat Fidelis Jes didn’t call him in anytime soon to discuss his use of time,\nbecause he was most definitely grasping at straws.\nThis Tampo fellow was no fool, Michel reasoned, looking out the\nhackney cab window at the passing faces going about their daily lives.

He\nprinted all those pamphlets and then went into hiding. He won’t resurface\nnow that he knows we’re looking for him. No way he’s stupid enough to\nkeep printing Sins of Empire.\n“But,” Michel muttered to himself, “maybe he made a mistake. Or\nmaybe he figures we’re so wrapped up keeping the lid on the boiling kettle\nthat is this city, we won’t have the resources to check every single\nprintshop.”\nWhich they didn’t, Michel reflected. Fidelis Jes had everyone looking\nfor Ben Styke, a name out of Michel’s childhood – Mad Ben Styke, hero of\nthe revolution! Fancy that. That tough old bastard still alive after so many\nyears.\nMichel was drifting again. “Focus!” he said, looking down at the list. A\nlittle over a hundred printers to check. He could do that in another twenty-\nfour hours or so – maybe forty-eight, if he took it a little easier. Some of\nthese were way on the outskirts of town. Once he had that done he could get\nback to some real work, whatever the pit that meant, and maybe get some\nsleep.\n“I thought this damn job was going to make my career. Now it’s looking\nlike it’ll tank it.”\nThe cab arrived at the Millinery, and Michel wondered if he shouldn’t\nhave just gone straight home. He was wobbly on his feet, and needed to get\nsome sleep. Maybe he’d plant his face on his desk for a couple of hours,\nthen get a cup of coffee and head back out.\nMichel paid his driver and stepped outside, watching as three prison\ncarriages pulled out of the street, followed by at least two dozen Iron Roses,\nall armed to the teeth. He blinked, wondering if he was seeing double, and\nwandered over to the old gatekeeper sitting on his chair just inside the\ndouble doors of the Millinery. “Hey, Keln, what’s going on over there?”\nKeln chewed slowly for a moment, then turned and spat a wad of\ntobacco into the street. “Six Iron Rose medallions just showed up on the\ngrand master’s desk.”\nMichel raised both eyebrows. That was news. “Shit. Where’d they come\nfrom?”\n“Greenfire Depths,” Keln said. “We’re trying to keep it quiet, but…”\nKeln leaned over conspiratorially. “Word has it they came from the Ben\nStyke fellow that Fidelis Jes has everyone looking for. You didn’t hear it\nfrom me, though.”\n“Cross my heart.”\n“Yeah, the boys are heading down to Greenfire Depths to try to recover\nthe bodies.”\n“Any chance of that happening?”\n“They sent word ahead to our Palo contacts. If the bodies are still in the\nDepths, the Palo will hand ’em over. They don’t want no trouble.”\nAnd, Michel thought, we’ll make a public show of force and quietly pay\nthem a few thousand krana per corpse. “Best of luck to them.”\n“Yeah. The Depths are really causing us a headache lately, aren’t they?”\nMichel hoped his expression wasn’t too clueless.

    "text": "“Yeah. The Depths are really causing us a headache lately, aren’t they?”\nMichel hoped his expression wasn’t too clueless. He tried to run through\nall the problems originating from Greenfire Depths – aside from the usual\nPalo protests and riots – and came up short. “Eh?”\n“Lady Flint,” Keln prompted.\nPit. Michel had completely forgotten about Flint. He hadn’t heard a\nword from her in days. Knowing his luck she was lying facedown in a\ngutter somewhere. “Right,” he said. “Lady Flint.” He paused, trying to\ncome up with a not-so-obvious way to get the information out of Keln and\ngave up. “What happened with Lady Flint?”\nKeln’s eyebrows rose. “Aren’t you her Blackhat contact?”\n“What happened with Lady Flint?” Michel asked again, forcefully.\n“A bunch of Palo punks tried to kill her.”\nMichel stared at Keln for a few moments while his tired brain tried to\ncatch up with that information. “Well, shit,” he said, and set off running for\nanother cab.\nMichel had the presence of mind to head back and get all the information he\ncould about the attack – which wasn’t much – before heading out to Loel’s\nFort. He arrived just an hour later and was surprised to find Lady Flint\nstanding a few blocks down the street from the fort, overlooking a\nconstruction site while hundreds of her men cleared away rubble from a\ndemolished tenement.\nMichel leapt from his cab, heading over to stand beside Lady Flint,\nhoping he didn’t look too panicked. An assassination attack on one of his\nwards and he didn’t even find out for two days? He would have castigated\nanyone beneath him for such an oversight.\nAt first glance, he wondered whether Keln had been pulling his leg.\nFlint looked unharmed. There wasn’t a scratch on her or her uniform, and\nshe seemed to be in a pleasant mood while she discussed something quietly\nwith another uniformed mercenary – an engineer, if Michel had to guess –\nwho then went and began giving orders to the men down in the rubble of\nthe tenement.\nMichel watched for a few minutes, noting the way Flint’s eyes roamed\nthe surrounding streets in a constant, watchful vigil, and the way her hand\nrested on the hilt of her sword. He wouldn’t say she was on edge,\nnecessarily – her body language was fairly relaxed – but she was keeping an\neye out.\nMichel cleared his throat.\n“Yes, Agent Bravis?” Flint asked without looking. “I was wondering\nhow long you were going to stand there.”\n“Just taking in the scene, ma’am,” Michel said jovially. “Looks like\nyou’re making great progress on these tenements.”\n“We are, thank you. We should begin construction of the replacement\nbuilding within a day or so, and my engineers expect to have one finished\nby the end of the month.”\n“That’s, ah, impressive.” Michel had no idea how long it took to build a\ntenement, but that sounded awfully fast.\n“It’s a wonder what you can do with five thousand sets of hands and a\nfew dozen competent engineers,” Flint said. “My men build a palisade\nevery night when we’re on the march in enemy territory. Gives them a lot of\nexperience with this kind of thing, and keeps them in shape.”"

Gives them a lot of\nexperience with this kind of thing, and keeps them in shape.”\nMichel vaguely remembered reading something about the ancient Deliv\nlegions doing the same. “Very good, ma’am. Has everything been going\nwell on your” – Michel paused, glancing around to be sure they wouldn’t be\noverheard – “other task?”\n“Not as quickly as I’d like,” Flint said. “But I believe I’ve made\nprogress.”\nFlint had yet to actually look his direction, and Michel had the feeling\nshe’d rather not give him the report he definitely needed to make to Fidelis\nJes. Pit. He didn’t have the time or energy for this. Perhaps it was best to\njust be direct. “I heard there was an attack.”\n“There was.”\n“What happened?”\nFlint finally glanced in his direction. The look she gave him was\nsomewhere between bemused and annoyed. “I thought you Blackhats knew\neverything that happened in the city.”\n“We have our… limitations. To be honest, all anyone at the Millinery\nknows is that a group of Palo attacked you. We don’t know who, or why, or\nwhere the information even came from. It seems everyone’s talking about it\nbut no one has any better details. I was hoping I could get your side of the\nstory and offer any assistance you might need in tracking down your\nattackers.”\n“The attackers are dead,” Flint said bluntly.\n“Ah.” And not a damn scratch on her. Did she defend herself, or had\nshe bodyguards?\n“They ambushed me outside a gala I was attending at the Yellow Hall. I\nhave not yet figured out who ordered the attack, or why, but I’m working on\nit. Does that satisfy, Agent Bravis?”\nMichel grimaced. Flint was definitely annoyed – rightfully so. She was\na general, after all, and it had taken her government contact two days just to\ncheck in on her after an attempt on her life. He decided to move past that as\nquickly as possible. “I haven’t heard anyone mention the Yellow Hall for a\nlong time. I understand that’s the center of Mama Palo’s power. And you\nwere just invited in?”\n“Vallencian got me an invitation.”\nMichel couldn’t help but smile. In a city full of despicable, scheming,\nthieving people, the Ice Baron was one of the few he found truly pleasant.\n“I’ll make a note of that, thank you. Were you able to meet with Mama\nPalo?”\n“No. Seems no outsiders do. But the pretense of building these new\ntenements has given me an in among the upper crust of Palo society. I’ve\ntalked with someone named Meln-Dun about beginning work like this” –\nshe gestured to the construction site – “in the Depths itself. A community\noutreach program directly toward the Palo, if you will. I sent you\ninformation on the project just after the assassination attempt. Didn’t you\nget my report?”\nMichel considered the stack of unread folders on his desk at the\nMillinery. “My apologies, Lady Flint, but I’m handling a hundred cases\nright now.

Refresh my memory.” He had to pay better attention. Maybe he\ncould assign Agent Warsim to Flint indefinitely – though a Bronze Rose\ndidn’t befit a general.\nFlint made a noncommittal noise in the back of her throat and Michel\ndecided to ignore it. “You’re using this construction project as a way to get\ncloser to Mama Palo?” he asked. He found the prospect fascinating. The\nBlackhats had a heavy-handed approach to just about every facet of their\ninvolvement with Fatrastan society. He doubted it had ever even occurred to\nany of the Gold Roses that reaching out to the Palo – instead of beating\nthem down – might actually gain them the cooperation they so bitterly\nsought.\n“That’s the idea,” Flint answered. “I think it’ll work, but I need your\napproval. And any information you have about Meln-Dun. Vallencian seems\nto trust him, but Vallencian seems to trust everyone.”\nMichel tried to remember what he could. “Meln-Dun is part owner of\none of the few remaining quarries down there. I believe he’s been\ncooperative with us in the past. One of the ‘good ones,’ I think my\ncolleagues in the Millinery would call him.”\n“So I can trust him?”\n“It’s Blackhat policy not to trust any Palo.”\n“Your tone,” Flint observed, “tells me you don’t agree with that policy.”\nMichel cursed himself for being careless. He really did need some\ndamned sleep. It was a small slipup, but if he accidentally criticized the\nBlackhats to anyone who actually cared, he might find himself on the\nwrong end of a long discussion with one of the less friendly occupants of\nthe Millinery. “I should rather say, Meln-Dun can be trusted as far as any\nPalo. In my opinion, Palo are people the same as any other, so…” He let the\nimplication hang in the air.\n“Double-speak for ‘it’s up to you,’ eh?” Flint asked.\nMichel gave her what he hoped was a charming smile. Maybe he should\njust go home. A few hours in his own bed would do wonders more than the\nsame time spent snoring into a file on his desk. “Meln-Dun is a respectable\nbusinessman,” he said. “You should feel safe working with him. But he’s\nalso highly placed in Palo society, and we have no idea how close he is to\nMama Palo.”\n“Too close,” Flint said, nodding, “and I risk him getting wind of our\nplot on Mama Palo. Too far, and he’s no good at all to me.”\n“Exactly.” Michel couldn’t help but wish there were more people like\nFlint in Landfall. Pit, in the Blackhats themselves. People who understood\nnuance, and were willing to take an unorthodox tactic to root out their\nenemies, were sorely lacking on the plateau. And the ones who did have\nthat ability, like Captain Blasdell, were relegated to desk work. If he earned\nhis Gold Rose, maybe he could change that.\nIf.\n“I’ll get you access to Greenfire Depths,” Michel said, “and the supplies"

But you\nmay have to convince Fidelis Jes you’re making progress toward your real\ngoal.”\nFlint waved the thought off, as if it were no real concern. “If Jes has any\ndoubts he shouldn’t have hired me. If he wants to question my tactics he\ncan come down here and do so to my face.”\nMichel had to suppress a laugh. That’s why people like Flint never rose\nto the top here in Landfall. If you want to be a Gold Rose or one of Lady\nChancellor’s inner circle, you had to be competent and subservient. Lots of\nsmiling, nodding, and ass-kissing. He wondered if Lady Flint was capable\nof any of those.\nHis eyes fell to her sword, and he briefly wondered if she’d be able to\nout-duel Fidelis Jes. He was said to be the deadliest man in Landfall, but he\nmade it a point never to fight anyone with sorcery. The fact that Lady Flint\nhad walked away from a Palo ambush in the Depths told Michel a lot about\nher combat prowess. But she was a powder mage. Without her powder, was\nshe any good?\n“One other question,” Flint said, bringing Michel out of his thoughts.\n“Are you familiar with someone named Gregious Tampo?”\nAll trace of exhaustion left Michel as quickly as if he’d been dunked in\nthe bay. “Where’d you hear that name?” he asked, trying to keep his voice\nsteady.\nFlint must have heard some excitement in his voice, because she turned\nto him with a frown, looking him up and down. “You seem distracted\ntoday,” she said.\n“Never mind that. Tampo. Where did you hear the name?” Gregious.\nMichel had a first name now, and that could mean a lot.\n“I met him,” Flint said.\n“Where?”\n“The Yellow Hall. He was at the gala the other night.”\n“You’re sure? Describe him to me!”\nFlint hesitated. “He was tall and thin. He had black hair. A bit of a\nhawkish face. Seemed a bit off to me, like someone you wouldn’t want to\nmeet in a back alley, but I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. He was\nincredibly rude to me at the gala, and I was wondering if he was someone I\nneed to look out for.”\nMichel licked his lips, half-tempted to tell Flint about his alternate\nmission. But no, he needed to keep that information close. “What did he\nsay? Did he tell you who he was, or where he lives?”\n“He didn’t offer a lot of information.” Flint dug through her pocket and\nthen handed Michel a card. All it said was “The Palo Herald” and\n“Gregious Tampo” in smaller letters underneath. Michel checked the back\nfor an address, but there was nothing.\n“Did he say where it was?”\n“Not that I recall. He said it was a small newspaper that catered to the\nPalo. But when I asked Vallencian, he’d never heard of it.”\n“Can I keep this?” Michel didn’t wait for an answer, but shoved the card"

He raised his hand toward the nearest cab. This was big.\nHuge, possibly. A small newspaper required a printing press, and printing\npresses could be traced. For the first time since he’d lost Tampo at his\noffices, Michel had another lead. “Thank you, Lady Flint. I’ll get the\npermissions you require.”\n“Wait,” Flint said. “What’s going on with Tampo?”\nA cab pulled away from the curb and headed toward Michel. “Tampo is\nan enemy of the state,” he told Lady Flint. “If you see him again, you must\narrest him and send for me – and only me – immediately. I must go. The\nMillinery,” he ordered the cabdriver, leaping onto the running board.\nMichel was going to find this Palo Herald, and this time he wasn’t\ngoing to let Tampo get away.\nCHAPTER 28\nS\ntyke entered a small Kresim church under the west rim of Greenfire\nDepths that matched the directions given to him by Old Man Fles. It was\na dilapidated wood building; practically a disaster waiting to happen, long\nrotted through by the constant damp at the bottom of the quarry. The church\nwas tucked up against the wall, a three-room construction with a steeple\natop which Kresimir’s Rope had long ago fallen off. The inside was well lit\nby gas lamps, the floor covered in rubbish, old pews long stolen or\ndestroyed.\nThere was an orderly queue of people along one side of the chapel, and\nat the front, atop what had once been an altar to Kresimir, sat an immense\nsoup pot and stacks of stale bread. Palo boys as young as Celine and all the\nway into their twenties either waited in line or already enjoyed their\nmorning meal squatting by the wall or sitting cross-legged in the empty\nchapel. Styke was more than a little surprised to recognize the man standing\nbehind the soup pot, dishing out bowls to the waiting youth.\nStyke watched him work for a moment, remaining unnoticed, then\npulled Celine to one side of the chapel and squatted down among the Palo,\nwho gave him space without comment. He pointed at Jackal.\n“Henrick Jackal,” he told Celine, “was an orphan like you. Now look at\nhim. Taking care of kids on the streets where he fought, killed, and stole.\nFunny how life works out.”\nCeline seemed more than a little impressed. “He looks like a killer.”\nStyke found a piece of horngum in his pocket and chewed thoughtfully\nfor a few moments. A little girl solemnly proclaiming a man she’d never\nmet as a killer made him chuckle, but she wasn’t wrong. Jackal was missing\nan ear and the pinkie on his left hand, but even beyond the obvious war\nwounds he was an intimidating man. He was well muscled but lean, and\nheld himself with the kind of confidence that tended to intimidate ordinary\nfolks. He wore an old brown duster, parted in the middle to reveal a\nstomach hard enough to take a kick from a mule, and a pair of old buckskin"

    "text": "folks. He wore an old brown duster, parted in the middle to reveal a\nstomach hard enough to take a kick from a mule, and a pair of old buckskin\npants. His red hair was long and braided off to one side, his shallow cheeks\ncovered in the ashen freckles of a Palo.\nA spiritualist, Fles had called him.\n“Henrick isn’t a Palo name,” Celine observed.\n“Neither is Jackal,” Styke said. “But an orphan can call himself\nanything he wants.”\nThey waited for almost thirty minutes for the line to die down, but more\nPalo teenagers entered the chapel to replace each that finished their\nbreakfast and left. Eventually a pair of teens came through the front door\nlugging a new soup pot, letting everyone in line know they were out of\nbread but that they had enough gruel to go around.\nStyke was just beginning to think this would go all day when a small\nPalo boy – probably no more than a year older than Celine – suddenly\napproached them. He held two bowls of soup, and the last two loaves of\nbread from the platter, and offered them to Styke and Celine.\nStyke took the soup, drinking it quickly and mopping the bottom of the\nbowl with the bread. It tasted awful, but Celine didn’t seem to mind. The\nboy watched them through their meal, then said in broken Adran, “Jackal\nwants to see you.”\nStyke palmed a few pennies and slipped them to the boy, getting up and\nstretching his legs. He searched his pockets for more horngum and came up\nempty, making a mental note to stop by an apothecary.\nJackal had been replaced at his post by a pair of Palo teens, and Styke\nslipped past them to head into the vestry. It proved to be a dark, closetlike\nspace, barely big enough for a sleeping roll and a small shrine comprised of\na human skull, in front of which he found Jackal kneeling. Jackal’s eyes\nwere closed, and he faced the shrine with lips moving silently.\n“You never struck me as the praying type,” Styke said.\n“I’m not praying. I’m talking.”\n“With?”\n“A spirit.”\nStyke tried to remember what he could of Palo religion. With so many\ntribes scattered across Fatrasta there tended to be a wide array of beliefs.\n“I’ve never met a Palo who believed they could talk to spirits.”\n“That’s because most Palo don’t.” Between sentences, Jackal’s lips\ncontinued to move as if he were carrying on two conversations at once.\nFinally, he gave a slight nod and opened his eyes, smiling warmly at Styke.\n“Colonel Styke. When the spirits told me you were still alive, I thought they\nwere playing a joke on me. The afterlife can get awfully boring, and spirits\naren’t to be trusted.”\nStyke snorted. He wondered if Jackal had finally lost the few marbles\nhe’d started with. “Good to see you, too, Jackal. I thought once the military\npolice were done with me they’d come after you.”\n“They did,” Jackal said, his face not changing expressions. “Ibana held\nthem off long enough for me to get away, and then her father pulled some"

Before the war, he’d liked his space. He rarely\nclosed within reach of another human being unless he was about to kill. Yet\nhe reached out, running one finger boldly across the deep scar on Styke’s\nface. “I’m sorry.”\nStyke wasn’t sure he liked this new Jackal. He already seemed too\ngentle to be the same man he’d fought with in the war. “Wasn’t your fault.\nNever mind that, anyway. Didn’t mean to take you away from your…\nservice. Just came by hoping you could help me out.”\n“The Dynize dragonman?” Jackal asked.\nStyke scowled. “How… How did you know that?” he asked, hand\nfalling to the hilt of his knife.\n“Because I talk to spirits,” Jackal said matter-of-factly. “Same way I\nknow the little girl hiding behind you is named Celine, and her father was a\nthief who died in the camps. Same way I know you murdered six Blackhats\ntoday, and that you plan on learning Fidelis Jes’s routine so you can murder\nhim when he least expects it.”\n“Pit,” Styke swore. There was no way Jackal could know all that just\nfrom whatever contacts he had among the Palo. Styke leaned forward a\nlittle and sniffed, but could sense no sorcery on Jackal. Spirits? Really?\nJackal’s smile was a little condescending. “Think me a nutter. Everyone\nelse does. But you’ll take my information just like the boys outside will\ntake my soup, won’t you?”\nStyke sucked on his teeth. Definitely not the same Jackal he’d once\nknown. Did that mean he could no longer trust him? Had Jackal turned into\na Blackhat agent, or did he have his own agenda? “Yeah. I will.”\n“You’re wondering if you can trust me,” Jackal said. “And I wonder the\nsame about you. You’re serving two masters right now. Lady Flint, and…”\nJackal’s lips moved silently, and he tilted his head as if to listen to an\nunseen voice. “… someone the spirits won’t even touch. Odd, that.” He\nshook his head, as if suddenly confused. “I see Ben Styke before me.\nBroken, changed. Neither of us is the same man we once were, but I believe\nwe once called each other friend. I would like us to do so again. To prove\nthat, I’ll tell you what I know about the Dynize. Come. Sit.”\nA few moments later Styke and Jackal sat at either end of Jackal’s\nbedroll, cross-legged, Celine sitting in Styke’s lap and listening to Jackal\nspeak, enraptured.\n“I’ve had to come about this information in the traditional way,” Jackal\nsaid, removing a flask from beneath the skull shrine and handing it to Styke."

They don’t particularly\nlike powder mages or Knacked, either, but I can usually get them to take a\ncloser look.”\n“Are you saying the dragonmen are bone-eyes?” Styke asked. He didn’t\nthink so – he would have smelled the sorcery on them.\n“No, but some of the legends about dragonmen are true. They’re\nanointed by bone-eyes, and it gives them some protection against sorcery.”\n“Anointed?”\n“I’m not sure exactly what that means, but considering the bone-eyes\nuse blood magic, it can’t be anything good.”\n“Says the man who speaks to the dead.”\n“Speaking to the dead, and using the life-force of others in one’s\nsorcery, are two very different things. Anyway, there are at least four\ndragonmen in Landfall.”\n“Four! Son of a bitch.”\n“At least. The Dynize have been here for over a year now, infiltrating\nthe various factions within Greenfire Depths. They have dozens of spies,\nand recruit the disaffected to their cause.”\n“Like those four Palo kids at Mama Sender’s.”\n“Exactly.”\n“What’s their cause?” Celine asked.\n“That,” Jackal said with a scowl, “is harder to say. They tell the youth\nstories of the glory of the Empire, of the wealth and decadence of their\ncivilization, and promise them riches beyond belief in return for another set\nof eyes.”\n“For what?”\n“For everything. The Dynize spies consume information the same way\nthe Blackhats do.”\n“Are they preparing for some kind of invasion?” Styke asked. “The\nEmpire has hidden behind closed borders for over a hundred years. Why\nmove on Landfall now?”\n“I think we’re getting ahead of ourselves,” Jackal responded. “They\nmay be preparing to open their borders again. As far as we know, they’ve\nsent spies all around the world to find out how civilization has progressed\nsince they were last a world power.”\n“The spirits don’t tell you any more than that?”\n“If you mock me, we won’t discuss this any further.”\nStyke checked his sarcastic tone. “Sorry,” he said. “It’s a lot to take in.”\n“The spirits have a very difficult time penetrating Dynize,” Jackal said\nafter a moment of consideration. “Dynize Privileged protect the Dynize\nborders from any kind of sorcerous scrying, and it seems to work fairly well\non the dead, too. I can’t spy on them any easier than I can spy on Lady\nChancellor Lindet behind the protection of her own Privileged.”\n“But you think the Dynize may just be feeling us out?”\n“Perhaps,” Jackal said.\n“So where do the dragonmen come into this?”\n“They appeared” – Jackal closed his eyes – “a couple of months ago and\nbegan making contact with their spies in the city.”\n“This is sounding more and more like the preparation for an invasion,”\nStyke said. “It’s what I’d do, anyway.” He had a brief vision of whole hosts\nof dragonmen marching up the coastline on Landfall.

Based on the one he\nfought two days ago, they’d cut through the Landfall garrison like a hot\nknife through butter.\n“They’re looking for something,” Jackal said.\n“What?”\n“The godstones.”\nStyke frowned. A peculiar name. “What are those?”\n“I’m not sure,” Jackal said. “The name first came to me two days ago\nfrom the lips of one of those boys you killed at Mama Sender’s.”\nStyke felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. “What does that\nmean?”\n“It’s much easier to wring information out of a spirit as they die – or are\nborn, depending on your perspective – and I happened to catch one of your\ndragonman’s acolytes as he entered the next world.”\n“Oh.” This was all getting to be too much for Styke. Sorcery never\nbothered him; he could smell it a mile away, and the enchanted armor he\nwore in the war could shrug off Privileged magic as easily as grapeshot. But\nthis business with spirits made his spine tingle. The dead were dead, and as\na man who’d put plenty of them in their graves he preferred they stay there.\nBut he did need information, and this was the best he was going to find. He\ntried to shrug off his discomfort. “Get anything else out of him?”\n“Nothing useful. The dragonman’s name was Kushel. He’s middle-aged,\nfrom a city called Heaven’s Pillar in Dynize. It seems he’s been looking for\nthe godstones for most of his life, and he’s convinced he’ll find them here in\nLandfall.”\nStyke leaned back on the bedroll and found himself considering the red\nmarks on the back of Celine’s neck. They, like those on his stomach and\nchest, had begun to bruise. The bruises would heal, but the thought of this\ndragonman manhandling a little girl – his little girl – made his blood boil.\nI’ve killed a lot of people. But I’ve never so much as hurt a kid. He\nremembered his thought about warriors, and how few of them remained in\nthe world. It might be old-fashioned, but a warrior left the young and infirm\nin peace and protected those under their responsibility.\n“I need more information,” Styke said.\n“I can try…”\n“No. I need it straight from the dragonman. I need to draw him out\nagain.”\nJackal hesitated. His eyes dipped tellingly to the scar on Styke’s face,\nthen to his mangled hand. “We’ve both changed,” Jackal said gently. “If it\nwas the old Styke, I’d believe you could fight a dragonman, but in your\nstate…”\n“Yeah,” Styke said, the words biting, “I know I’m a cripple. But I’m\nMad Ben Styke, and I’m no fool. You can get word to him, can’t you? Your\nspirits can tell you where he is, and your boys can deliver a message?”\n“This isn’t a good idea.”\n“You haven’t even heard the idea,” Styke said. “I want you to tell"

I’m not facing this bastard alone. If he’s\na legendary warrior, he can fight this old cripple for it on my own terms.\nAnd if I lose, at least I’ll have the satisfaction of knowing Lady Flint will\nput a bullet in his head.”\n“He won’t fall for it,” Jackal said.\nStyke removed the bone knife from his belt, as well as his own big\nknife, holding them side by side so Jackal could see. “The stories say these\nweapons are part of a dragonman’s identity. If someone I hated had my\nknife, you bet your ass I’d cut my way through a brigade of infantry to get it\nback.” He returned the knives, his eyes falling once more on the bruises on\nCeline’s neck. “Just send the message.”\nCHAPTER 29\nV\nlora stared at a smudge of blood on the slimy, limestone floor of\nGreenfire Depths and struggled to keep her anger in check. She could\nfeel it at the edges of her awareness shoving and pushing like a creature\ntrapped in a bubble of her mental making; a bubble that threatened to burst\nat any moment. She fought to keep her face stoic, her demeanor\nprofessional, even while a part of her reached out with her sorcerous senses\nto feel the black powder on the soldiers around her. Like standing on the\nedge of a cliff with the unnatural impulse to jump, she felt the urge to\ndetonate every ounce of powder within the radius of her sorcery, killing her,\nher men, and no doubt hundreds of innocent Palo.\nPerhaps some guilty ones, too.\n“Please tell me,” she said calmly, “that we know something.”\nOlem’s Knack prevented him from needing sleep, but the redness in his\neyes told her that he’d been pushing himself too far, not getting enough rest\nas he sought to gather all the information she needed from this city. He was\nfrayed at the edges, smoking like a chimney, and the glint in his eye said he\nknew exactly what sort of self-destructive beast was rampaging through her\nhead.\n“All we know is this is the last place they were seen,” Olem said. They\nstood about fifty yards into Greenfire Depths from the bottom of the Rim.\nThe only light came from strategically placed reflective mirrors, and the\ndirty street – more like a corridor – was empty of Palo and eerily silent.\nVlora had twenty soldiers with her and not a single one so much as\nmuttered as they stared somberly at her and Olem.\nThey’d been with her long enough to know her moods.\nThe subject of their discussion, a single engineer and a squad of\nbodyguards that had come down here this morning to survey the destruction\nof a block of these spiderweb-like tenements, was missing.

    "text": "three hours late in reporting in when Vlora decided to lead an expedition to\nlook for them, and in another three hours all she’d managed to find was this\nsmudge of blood and a trail that went completely cold.\n“This is where they were last seen?” Vlora echoed. “What were they\nlast seen doing? Was there gunfire? Shouting? Screams? Damn it, Olem, I\nneed answers.”\nOlem stared back at her, eyes narrowing slightly, and she immediately\nregretted raising her voice. “We’ve combed every tenement within a\nhundred yards. Not a single person reports anything out of the ordinary.\nThat some of them mentioned our boys passing through at all is a miracle.\nWe’re not wanted here.”\nThat’s just too bad for them, isn’t it? “Palo silence, huh?” Vlora\nremembered her talk with Gregious Tampo, along with the warning about\nher status among the Palo. She was their villain, and to think she could\nchange that with a few handshakes and a now-well-publicized desire to\nrebuild a block of tenements was folly.\n“Palo silence,” Olem agreed.\n“Expand our search area to two hundred yards. Bring more men down. I\nwant our boys found.” The orders were barely above a whisper, and Vlora\ncould immediately see that Olem didn’t like them.\n“We shouldn’t risk more men,” Olem said reasonably.\n“I won’t abandon them.”\n“Every minute we’re down here is another minute our enemies have to\nplan another attack.”\n“If this was an attack.”\nOlem looked pointedly at the smear of blood. “If we go kicking down\ndoors, we’ll be working against ourselves. We have to return to the fort and\nregroup.”\nVlora closed her eyes. She knew Olem was right. She had a\nresponsibility toward more than just the nine men who’d gone missing. The\nengineer, Petaer, was a particularly talented young man and his loss would\nbe palpable, but the others were infantry. Her infantry, but infantry\nnonetheless. She needed to attend to the brigade. Not a single squad. But if\nshe abandoned a squad, at what point would the men begin to wonder if\nthey, too, would be abandoned?\n“The order stands,” she said, opening her eyes and locking them with\nOlem. His lip curled in a brief show of defiance, then he looked away,\nashing his cigarette.\n“All right,” he said quietly.\n“Two hundred yards. If they find anything, let me know immediately.\nNo violence. Our men are to travel in groups of no fewer than twenty at any\ntime. And tell them to begin mapping this area of the Depths in three\ndimensions. I want to know what this warren looks like. Search until eight,\nthen call it off.”\nOlem perked up. “A map will be useful.”\n“That’s why they pay me so well.” Vlora slapped him on the shoulder\nwith enthusiasm she didn’t feel and turned back toward the entrance to the\nDepths that she could see through the dim light behind them. “Get me\nMeln-Dun.

    "text": "Meln-Dun. If I’m going to play his petty politics, I want him to protect my\nmen.”\nMeln-Dun entered Vlora’s office in Loel’s Fort with hat in hand, a\nmeasured, sympathetic smile on his face. Vlora shook his hand and offered\nhim a seat, and he spoke before she could begin.\n“I’m very sorry to hear about the loss of your men,” he said.\nVlora had to consciously keep her eyes from narrowing. How could he\npossibly know about the attack? “You know about that, eh?”\n“Word spreads quickly in the Depths, and your men have been\nsearching for hours.”\nOf course. A few hundred mercenary soldiers knocking on doors in one\ncorner of the Depths surely would have attracted attention. This whole\nsituation had her squinting at shadows, and Meln-Dun had done nothing to\nearn her distrust. “I’m sure it does. Which is why I was hoping for your\nhelp in finding my men.”\nMeln-Dun seemed to have expected the request, nodding before her\nsentence was even finished. “I already have my contacts looking into it,\nLady Flint, and I’m honored that you’d ask my help.” He hesitated a\nmoment, then continued: “You have a reputation for respecting honesty,\ncorrect?”\n“I do.” Vlora didn’t like the sound of that.\n“Then, out of respect for that, I will not lie. I don’t expect to find your\nmen alive. Nine soldiers disappearing in the Depths suggests they did not\nsimply get lost.”\n“I’m not a fool,” Vlora responded, hoping it didn’t come off too\nforcefully. “I’m aware they may already be long dead. But if there is a slight\nchance they’re still alive, or of recovering their bodies, I’d like to do it as\nquickly as possible.”\n“Understood.”\nMeln-Dun studied Vlora’s face, and not for the first time she found\nherself questioning his motives. She was so used to operating in the larger\nsphere of influence – with governors, generals, Privileged, and even kings –\nthat she had to adjust her thinking to really understand the machinations of\na local slumlord. Perhaps he was trying to improve his standing in the\nDepths, or perhaps he simply wanted to help usher in an era of\nreconstruction. She wondered if it was of any real importance. Once she\nfound Mama Palo, her job here would be done and she could forget about\nthe petty local politics.\nEven as the thoughts went through her head, she mentally mocked her\nown arrogance. Did she really care so little for the people of Landfall?\nWould she be able to abandon these plans for new tenements and march off\non the next mission? Her work here could inspire a new generation –\nperhaps a young politician or future general. It would be shortsighted of her\nto simply walk away from it.\nWhat had Tamas always said? The minutiae of the common man is the\ngrease that slicks the gears of civilization.\nShe wasn’t a good enough thespian to act the part of a concerned\nforeign national. She had to care, and she did. Perhaps that’s what Meln-\nDun had sensed upon their first meeting. She pulled herself back to the\npresent and smiled at Meln-Dun."

    "text": "foreign national. She had to care, and she did. Perhaps that’s what Meln-\nDun had sensed upon their first meeting. She pulled herself back to the\npresent and smiled at Meln-Dun.\nHe smiled back and said, “Your concern for your men does you credit.\nThe Blackhats simply write off their missing with barely more than a wave\n– their primary concern is getting back the Roses they wear around their\nnecks.”\n“Does this happen often?” Vlora shifted sideways in her chair. “The\ndisappearing?”\nMeln-Dun hesitated. “Since Mama Palo came to power, it’s become\nincreasingly common. People go missing in the Depths, sometimes\ncivilians, but mostly Blackhats. It’s become a fact of life, and makes it very\ndifficult for men like me to do business.”\nVlora was surprised at the honesty of the answer. She’d assumed that\nthe Palo were united in their hate of the current government, but Meln-Dun\nsounded almost regretful. There was something here. Something she could\nuse. “Don’t you hate the Blackhats?”\n“Ah-hah, Lady Flint, you will not catch me so easily,” Meln-Dun said,\nhalf-seriously. “I would never speak ill of the Lady Chancellor or her\nchosen servants.”\nSpoken like a true politician. A nonanswer was often more an answer\nthan a definitive one. Meln-Dun didn’t trust the Blackhats, but then Vlora\nhadn’t expected him to. “And Mama Palo’s policies? You don’t agree with\nthem?”\n“I wouldn’t say that, either,” Meln-Dun said carefully. “I’ve just noted\nthat the disappearances and the violence have increased since Mama Palo\ncame into power. She supports violent revolutionaries like the Red Hand\nand offers succor to his agents. It’s bad for business.”\nVlora was beginning to see a picture of a man caught between two\npowers – the Blackhats who ran Landfall, and Mama Palo’s goons who ran\nthe Depths. She had wondered if his motives had extended beyond money\nand perhaps here they were – giving the people of the Depths a third choice\nfor their loyalty. It took a brash, ballsy character to play both sides of the\ngame like this. She needed to probe further.\nVlora said, “Forgive me if this comes across as rude, but do you\nconsider yourself a businessman above a Palo?”\nMeln-Dun raised his chin. “I am both, Lady Flint, and proud of it.”\n“Of course.”\n“That’s like asking you if you consider yourself an Adran or a general\nfirst. It’s a ridiculous notion.”\nVlora noted the tightening of his eyes when he spoke, and the way he\nhunched his shoulders inwardly, like a cat wondering if it had been backed\ninto a corner. He was playing both sides. She’d bet her sword on it. Vlora\nmade a calming gesture. “My apologies. You’re right, it is ridiculous.”\nSlowly, his shoulders relaxed and he leaned back in his chair. “I hope,”\nhe said, “that this partnership between us – building these new tenements in\nGreenfire Depths – will be the first step in something larger. I would like, in\nmy own small way, to decrease the tensions between Palo and Fatrastans.”"

I would like, in\nmy own small way, to decrease the tensions between Palo and Fatrastans.”\n“Constructing new buildings would do that?” Vlora asked. She watched\nMeln-Dun’s eyes, looking for any additional hint as to what he was\nthinking. This new realization – that he was making his own bid for power\n– could be very useful. But she would have to be careful.\n“I believe it is a start.”\n“What’s the end?”\n“The end is obvious. Palo and Fatrastans working together to create a\nbetter world.”\n“That sounds like a laudable goal. What other steps do you foresee\nalong the way?”\nMeln-Dun leaned forward, as if surprised that Vlora was even\ninterested. “Extending Lindet’s modernization to the Depths, to start. More\nbusiness between the Depths and the rest of Landfall. Perhaps over time,\nconvincing Lindet to allow Palo to settle in some of the nicer areas of the\ncity. The more Fatrastans are exposed to us, and us to them, the less we will\nhave to fear each other.”\n“I wouldn’t have pegged you as an idealist,” Vlora said.\n“I am not,” Meln-Dun retorted. “I am pragmatic, and I pretend to be\nnothing more. Good relations create better business opportunities.”\nVlora had to laugh at that. “You remind me of a friend of mine,” she\nsaid. “Ricard Tumblar.”\n“I know that name,” Meln-Dun said. “A prominent Adran, correct?”\n“Very prominent. He’s a businessman, and was the very first First\nMinister of Adro, elected by the people.”\n“Ah, yes,” Meln-Dun said. “After your field marshal sent your king to\nthe guillotine.”\nMeln-Dun butchered the pronunciation of “guillotine” and Vlora might\nhave laughed had her memories not instantly gone back to the coup, and the\nAdran-Kez War that followed it. Those years, more than any others, had\ninfluenced who she was today. She had some fondness for them, but far\nmore regret. So many unnecessary deaths, so many betrayals big and small.\n“That’s right,” she said. “And a whole different discussion. I’m glad that\nyou’re able to put your pragmatism to good use. So often pragmatics are\ntinged with cynicism.”\n“I think,” Meln-Dun answered, “that is how I would describe Mama\nPalo. Cynical. An idealistic cynic, and…” He hesitated, glancing over his\nshoulder as if Mama Palo were right behind him.\nVlora gestured to the empty office. “Feel free to speak your mind. If\nyou know anything about me, it’s that I’m not a gossip.”\n“I really shouldn’t,” Meln-Dun said warily.\nYou really should. Vlora could feel her heart beating faster. “You don’t\nhave to say anything you don’t want, but know you’re among friends.”\nThere were several moments of silence before Vlora changed tactics. She\nquietly said, “Do you suspect that Mama Palo is behind the disappearance\nof my men?”\n“I did not say that.”"

She\nquietly said, “Do you suspect that Mama Palo is behind the disappearance\nof my men?”\n“I did not say that.”\n“You implied it.” She leaned forward. “This is something I need to\nknow, Meln-Dun. I do not like petty politics. If Mama Palo is behind the\ndisappearance of my men, I need to know why. Was she behind the attempt\non my life the other night? Was I invited to the gala only to be a target? Are\nyou one of her agents? Is all of this” – she gestured at Meln-Dun – “just a\nway of getting me to lower my guard?”\nMeln-Dun swallowed, beads of sweat appearing on his balding head.\n“In my world,” Vlora said, “wars are declared.”\n“Not in mine,” Meln-Dun responded. “I am not your enemy. I am not\none of Mama Palo’s agents, and I know nothing about the disappearance of\nyour men.”\nVlora watched his eyes for any sign of a lie. He met her gaze,\nunwavering.\nMeln-Dun continued: “Mama Palo is crafty, striking from the shadows.\nShe is an old woman, embittered toward the Kressian settlers who killed her\nhusband, and the Blackhats who killed her son.”\nVlora opened her mouth, surprised. “I did not know that.”\n“It’s common knowledge in the Depths. We all have our own reasons\nfor fighting our private wars. Mama Palo has taken hers public. As I said,\nshe is an old woman, and old women are seldom direct. They achieved their\nage by being crafty, circumspect. Those Palo that attacked you outside the\nYellow Hall may very well have been her men. They botched the job and\nnow are trying to make up for it by whittling away at your forces.”\n“Inviting me to the party was a way to get me out on my own?”\n“It could have been.” Even now, Meln-Dun seemed loath to accept the\nidea as fact. “There are a thousand factions within the Depths, intertwined\nin ways that reflect your own political courts. It may have been someone\nelse entirely, but know this: Few people act in the Depths without Mama\nPalo’s say-so.”\n“Do you?” Vlora asked bluntly.\n“I will not lie to you. Most of my business is approved – or not – by\nMama Palo.”\nAnother interesting bit of information. Mama Palo was bad for business\nin her encouragement of violence, and she could stifle Meln-Dun’s\nentrepreneurship? Another reason for Meln-Dun to want her out of the way.\n“And this thing that we’re planning?” Vlora asked. “Beginning a\nmodernization of the Greenfire Depths tenements?”\n“She knows about our partnership.”\nVlora wasn’t surprised – they’d spent the last two days attempting to\npublicize her mercenaries’ good intentions. No doubt Meln-Dun had been\ninvolved in a similar propaganda campaign on the Palo side of things. The\ninteresting part was that Mama Palo had approved of this whole endeavor.\nPerhaps the crafty old Palo was trying to draw Vlora out again, waiting for\nVlora to make a mistake?\nIt was a game in which she couldn’t see her opponent’s face, or most of"

Petty politics. I’ve fought much worse, she reminded herself.\nVlora wondered how much she truly trusted Meln-Dun. He was, after\nall, a Palo. Vlora tried to recognize that their reputation belonged mostly to\na smear campaign by Lindet, but the Palo had also been her enemy in the\nswamps for over a year. She couldn’t just ignore that because Meln-Dun\nwas friendly. But she had to trust someone, and Meln-Dun seemed to be\ntrustworthy as far as his own interests were concerned.\nThere was a knock on the door, and a messenger appeared with a note\nfor Meln-Dun. The businessman looked it over with a scowl, then nodded to\nhimself. “I must go, Lady Flint, but I will do what I can to stop these\ndisappearances and find your missing men. The sooner things calm down,\nthe easier it will be to begin to modernize the Depths.”\nHe needs me more than I need him, Vlora realized suddenly. Or at least,\nhe thinks that’s the case. It was best to let him keep thinking that. She shook\nhis hand and watched him go, called for Olem, and sat down to meditate on\nthe conversation. She drew her sword, checking the balance, deep in\nthought.\nOf all the people Vlora had met in Landfall so far, Meln-Dun was in the\nbest position to comment on Palo politics. Until she learned otherwise, his\nguess was as good as a declaration: Mama Palo was waging a war on Vlora\nand the Riflejacks. Vlora couldn’t be sure why: a grudge, tactical\nmaneuvering, or even inside knowledge of Vlora’s real task. But it meant\nthat Vlora had lost the element of surprise.\nShe couldn’t sit around waiting for Mama Palo to fall into her lap. She’d\nhave to move quickly, or risk the disappearance of more of her men.\nAn attack on an enemy she knew so little about could very well get her\nand her men killed. It was risky. But Meln-Dun was Vlora’s wild card, and\nshe thought she already had a way to use him.\nCHAPTER 30\nI\nt took Michel the rest of the day and part of the next morning to find just\ntwo mentions of the Palo Herald in the Blackhat files at the Millinery.\nOne referred to a junk Palo press that might or might not be printing\npropaganda. The second was just an address scribbled down in pencil.\nBased on the limited pieces of information, both of which were months old,\nno one had ever bothered following up on any rumors that may have\nspurred the first report.\nHe left the Millinery just after noon the next day, leaving the address of\nthe Palo Herald with Agent Warsim in case he took longer than twenty-four\nhours to report back in. He briefly considered trying to deputize a few Iron\nRoses to keep an eye on him, but opted just to bring along his old\nknuckledusters. The Millinery was still on full alert looking for Ben Styke,\nand Michel didn’t want to do anything that might bring on the grand"

    "text": "knuckledusters. The Millinery was still on full alert looking for Ben Styke,\nand Michel didn’t want to do anything that might bring on the grand\nmaster’s attention before he was absolutely certain he had a line on Tampo.\nThe address was in a mostly Palo village called Landon Plain. About six\nmiles northwest of the plateau, it was one of the many towns along the\nHadshaw built almost entirely upon pylons that allowed the rickety wood\nhouses to weather spring flooding. It appeared to be a small, but thriving\ntrading center with a keelboat landing, three general stores, and even a\ntheater. Michel left his cab near the city center and began walking down the\nhard-packed silt streets, muttering the address over and over again as he\nscanned the number plates above homes and shops – only about a quarter of\nwhich were actually marked.\nMichel had opted to leave his black shirt and bowler cap at home, and\ninstead wore a loose pair of rough wool workman’s trousers and a cotton\nshirt, sleeves rolled up, flatcap pushed back on his head. A lone Blackhat in\na Palo community tended to become a target; a poor Kressian day laborer\nmight still get robbed, but would probably make it home in one piece.\nA few eyes watched him as he passed, but no one followed him through\nthe twisting streets. He was beginning to think the address was a dead end\nwhen he caught sight of a pair of number plates, the first two letters of\nwhich matched those on his card. He found a raised walkway and headed\ninto a series of what looked like warehouses and industrial buildings, all\nconstructed on the same batch of pylons. Palo workers moved bales of\ncotton and tobacco in and out of storage while foremen called out\ninstructions. Michel was largely ignored.\nHe finally matched his address at the opposite end of the raised\nindustrial park. There was a single door into a small shed of a building; a\nlean-to addendum to the warehouse next to it, with the words PALO\nHERALD stenciled in Palo on a sign next to the door. Michel peered in the\nwindow, then looked over his shoulder. There didn’t appear to be anyone\naround.\nNor, he decided, did this little building look big enough to hold even a\nsmall printing press.\nMichel opened the door and headed inside, one hand on the\nknuckledusters in his pocket and the other putting a cheap pipe in his mouth\nas he adopted a northeastern accent in his head. “Hallo?” he called.\n“Hallo?”\nThe Palo Herald was about as roomy as an outhouse. There were a few\ncrates, newspapers spilling out the sides, and an old Palo man sitting with\nhis back to the same wall the door was on. He wore an old buckskin jacket\nover a bare chest and a pair of cutoff wool trousers. His feet were bare, and\nhe squinted up at Michel suspiciously.\n“What can I do for you, sir?” he asked in broken Adran.\n“Ah, hallo!” Michel said. “Is this the Palo Herald?”\nThe old man pointed above Michel’s head. Michel took a step back and\nmade a show of reading the sign outside. He switched over to Palo, hoping\nhe wasn’t too damn rusty to make a good impression. “Afternoon, friend."

He switched over to Palo, hoping\nhe wasn’t too damn rusty to make a good impression. “Afternoon, friend.\nLooks like I came to the right place.” He stepped over to one of the nearby\ncrates and unobtrusively glanced inside. “My name’s Fallon Marks and I’m\nan editor. A newspaper editor by trade, actually, and I’m looking for work.\nJust came down from Little Starland and was passing through, heard there\nwas a newspaper in town.”\n“It’s a Palo paper,” the old man said, not unkindly. “Don’t think it’s\nyour kind of thing.”\n“Well, it actually is my kind of thing. I’ve been editing a Palo\nnewspaper up in Little Starland – the Daily Basin, you may have heard of\nit? – and to be honest, my friend, we ran out of funding and were forced to\nsell off all our equipment, wouldn’t you believe it now? I’d hoped with\nLandfall being a big city there might be a Palo newspaper, or the chance to\nstart one. Just as my luck ran out I was told about you. Is this where you\nprint the newspaper?”\n“Nope,” the old man said. “Don’t think we’re hiring, either. Not a big\noperation. Just a few of the boys, working to spread the word of our land.”\n“Understood, understood. Right you are, my friend. Times are lean and\nhard, don’t I know it, and to be fully honest I would work for a roof over\nmy head and a bit of porridge in the mornings, if you catch my meaning. At\nleast until I was able to secure some funding for a newspaper in Landfall.”\nThe old man tilted his head to one side, seemingly bemused. “Ain’t\nnever heard of your…”\n“The Daily Basin.”\n“… Daily Basin. Didn’t know there was a Palo newspaper up in Little\nStarland.”\n“Not anymore, I’m afraid,” Michel said with a sigh. “But you know,\nLandfall, I think maybe I can find some work down there. I guess I could\nlook at the Kressian newspapers, but the Palo, well, the Palo are my\npassion, I’ve got to admit, don’t you know. My granddaddy on my mother’s\nside was a Palo and I’m proud of that.”\n“Ah,” the old man said, his bemusement turning into a real smile. “Part\nbrother, then?”\n“Part brother indeed. Look, do you think you could see it in your heart\nto consider employment, good sir? I’d work for a roof for a few weeks, try\nto prove myself.”\n“Not my printshop,” the old man said.\n“Well, you think I could talk to the owner?”\n“He’s not around now. Rarely comes out.”\n“Well, could I get an address?”\n“No.” The old man gave a sympathetic smile. “No one talks to the\nowner. I could pass him your card, if you like.”\n“My card, yes! That would be perfect.” Michel searched his pockets,\nletting a frown grow until he came up empty-handed. “It doesn’t look like I\nhave any on me right now. I sent my luggage on ahead to Landfall, don’t\nyou know, and to think I didn’t keep a card on me. I could leave my"

    "text": "have any on me right now. I sent my luggage on ahead to Landfall, don’t\nyou know, and to think I didn’t keep a card on me. I could leave my\ncousin’s address.” Before the old man could respond, Michel snatched up a\npencil and bit of paper and scribbled down the address of a Blackhat safe\nhouse, taking the opportunity to look closer at the crates of newspapers.\nThey appeared to be just that – newspapers – most of them old and yellow,\nwith a few recent issues on the very top. The latest was a couple of weeks\nold and had the words LADY FLINT BURNS FORT SAMNAN in bold letters.\n“Here you are, good sir, and thank you so much for taking the time to talk\nto me.”\nThe old man took the paper without comment, rolling it like a cigarette\nand tucking it behind his ear. “Don’t hold your breath,” he said. “The big\nboss doesn’t like Kressians very much.”\n“I understand,” Michel said, wondering not for the first time if he’d\nfollowed a cold trail. No printing equipment on the premises, just some old\nnewspapers, with no sign of any pamphlets. An absentee owner could\nindicate Tampo, but the fact that he “didn’t like Kressians” suggested the\nowner was Palo. Michel couldn’t think of a subtle way to ask if that was the\ncase. “Pardon me, but just out of curiosity, where do you do your writing\nand printing? I could always drop in there and offer to lend a hand.”\n“No one’s around today,” the old man said. “Waste of time. Thanks for\ncoming in.”\nIt was an obvious dismissal, and Michel took the hint and tipped his cap\nto the old man. “Thanks again, good sir, have a blessed day.”\nHe headed back out into the industrial park and took a look around,\nwatching the Palo at work farther down the boardwalk. Most of the doors in\nthe area were open to let air circulate and bring cargo in and out for\ntransportation down to the keelboat landing. The only building with a\nclosed bay door was the one immediately next to the Palo Herald. Michel\nchecked the bay door gently to find it locked, then headed around to the\nback of the building to find a single door, the window blacked out, also\nlocked.\nMichel thought about jimmying the lock, but picking his way into a\nPalo warehouse in broad daylight seemed like a very bad idea. Instead, he\nwent back to the street and waited until no one was looking before ducking\nbeneath the industrial park.\nSomething he’d long ago learned about these towns built on stilts on the\nfloodplain is that almost every single house had a trapdoor under it.\nSometimes they were left unlocked so that no one could get trapped\nunderneath during a flash flood. More often they were used to circulate cool\nair during the summer. A warehouse, he reasoned, would have several such\nentrances. He bent over double and picked his way through the refuse that\nhad piled up underneath the building until he reasoned he was directly\nunder the Palo Herald. Then he headed another fifteen feet and found a\ntrapdoor, right where he’d expected it.\nHe pushed up gently. Locked.\nApplying a little more pressure, he was able to get the trapdoor far"

Locked.\nApplying a little more pressure, he was able to get the trapdoor far\nenough up to see that it was blocked by a simple wooden latch. Michel\ndrew his belt knife and slid the latch, then lifted the trapdoor to get a view\ninside the warehouse. It was dark and quiet, the only light coming from\nwindows far up on the back side of the building. He listened for a few\nmoments and then swung the door up and open, lifting himself inside.\nHe found himself less than three feet from a printing press. It looked\nlike many of the others he’d seen, a loomlike contraption with two belts and\na drum in the center, with a treadle on the other side to spin the belts. A\nmachine like this could be operated relatively quietly, without attracting the\ntype of attention that a steam press would.\nStill, he wasn’t convinced he had the right place. Keeping low, ready to\nmake a run for the trapdoor, he crept the length of the warehouse. There\nwas a narrow stairway up to a windowed office above him, not much larger\nthan the storefront next door, and he found a second printing press. This one\nhad a slightly different design, with what looked like some sort of a fold-\nand-thread mechanism – the exact sort of thing needed to print and bind a\npamphlet. He turned his attention away from the printer and checked the\nnearest crates, going so far as to pry the lids off several using his knife and\nmaking far more noise than he was comfortable with.\nIt was on his fourth crate, just as he was beginning to think he had the\nwrong place, that he pried the lid to reveal a whole stack of Sins of Empire.\n“Damn it all, Michel, you might make yourself an investigator yet.”\n“Careful,” he whispered back at himself. “We’re not out of this. You’ve\ngot to set up a sting to catch Tampo. If he doesn’t come down here much we\nmight not be able to catch him quickly.”\n“But we have a building to trace for ownership records. More people to\nquestion who might know where he lives. You’ve got a damned good start.\nNow don’t foul it up.”\nHe carefully returned the lids to their spots, pressing down on the nails\nwith the handle of his knife and hoping no one noticed they weren’t\nhammered. He finished the last and crept quietly back toward the trapdoor,\nwondering how he was going to flip the latch back shut behind him.\nA sudden noise made him jump, and his heart leapt into his throat at the\nrealization it was the lock on the bay doors. He threw caution to the wind\nand ran toward the trapdoor, lowering himself down and pulling the door\nshut over his head just as he heard the bay open up and the old Palo man’s\nvoice say something muffled.\nMichel let out a soft sigh. Well, that was that. Time to head back to his\ncab, and…\n“We don’t like snoops, mister,” a voice said in Palo.\nMichel spun awkwardly to find a Palo woman easily a foot taller than\nhim with shoulders like an ox crouching just behind him.

His feet\nscrambled for purchase in the soft, sandy peat beneath the warehouse, and\nhe opened his mouth to let out a shout, only for her fist to connect hard with\nhis jaw. His head jerked back and he caught himself on a pair of stilts,\ntrying to grasp for his knuckledusters as the Palo woman’s fist rose and fell\none more time.\nThe blow knocked the sense out of him, throwing him to the ground,\nand he could only watch, stunned, as she grabbed him by the leg and pulled\nhim back toward the trapdoor. “I got him!” she shouted up. “Here, come\ntake him. We don’t know if we’re being watched.”\nMichel looked up into the faces of five Palo, including the old man, and\nfelt himself lifted under the arms and handed up.\n“Well,” he said, his eyes going in and out of focus. “Shit.”\nCHAPTER 31\n“N\no,” Styke said.\nHe sat in the corner of the Loel’s Fort mess hall, watching as more than\na thousand soldiers cleaned away the remains of dinner and broke out dice,\ndarts, cards, and beer. He found himself impressed by the orderliness of the\nprocess, and how it contrasted with normal military procedure – sending the\nmen out on the town for their entertainment – in a way that focused their\nattention inward. For any other military company such a habit might drive\nthe men mad with cabin fever, but here it just seemed to build the bonds\nbetween them.\nStyke glanced up at the young soldier in front of him. Well, he thought\nof the woman as young, but she was probably in her thirties, thin as a rail\nand looking sharp in her crimson uniform with its dark blue cuffs and the\ncrossed muskets and shako of the Riflejacks pinned to her breast. By the\npins on her lapel, she was a sergeant. She held her hat in one hand, as if in\nsupplication, and gave Styke an almost flirtatious smile.\n“Are you sure?” she asked. “Word’s been going around about you, Mr.\nStyke, and the boys are itching to hear about the time you fought beside\nTaniel Two-shot. Most of us served with him in the Adran-Kez War, you\nknow. We don’t know much about his time in Fatrasta.”\nStyke rolled his tongue around in his cheek, considering. There was a\ntime when he liked telling stories – when he liked being the center of\nattention in a hall full of heroes. Not anymore. His eyes found Lady Flint,\nsitting at the other end of the hall with Colonel Olem and surrounded by\nsoldiers of all ranks, and he wondered what she’d think of hearing about the\nheroism of her dead ex-fiancé. “I don’t think —”\nHe was cut off by a tug on his sleeve. It was Celine, sitting beside him\nwith her feet dangling from her chair, red sauce from tonight’s spiced\nmutton all over her cheeks. “I want to hear about it, Ben.”\nStyke hesitated long enough for the sergeant to try again. “The rumor is\nyou killed a Warden with your bare hands,” she said.

There was a bit of a\nchallenge to her smile, as if she suspected such a rumor was nothing more\nthan soldierly bragging taken to the extreme. “Taniel Two-shot aside, we’d\ndamn like to hear about that Warden.”\n“Please,” Celine said, drawing the word out.\nStyke sighed. This felt a lot like he was being ganged up on. He\nwondered if he could safely get out of this without having to make a fool\nout of himself, but dozens of glances were being tossed in his direction.\nThis sergeant wasn’t acting alone. Word really had gotten around. He\nleaned over to Celine. “You get me that horngum I sent you out for earlier?”\nCeline handed him a package from a local apothecary, and he gratefully\nunwrapped it and broke off a bit of horngum root, tucking it into his cheek.\nCeline smiled up at him, and he wiped the sauce from the corners of her\nmouth with his sleeve. “All right,” he conceded.\nThe sergeant beamed at him, then turned around and put two fingers in\nher mouth, letting out a shrill whistle that brought silence on the hall. “Oi!\nWe’re gonna get a story, lads!”\nStyke felt a flutter in his belly as all eyes suddenly turned toward him.\n“Right,” he muttered to himself. “You’ve done this before, big man. Just tell\nit like it happened.” He went to the center of the room and climbed onto the\nlongest table, looking around at the sea of crimson uniforms and grizzled\nfaces. These weren’t green kids heading to war. These were veterans. And\nveterans were always harder to please. He fiddled with his ring – one of the\nfew things that reminded him who and what he once had been – and locked\neyes with Lady Flint from across the hall. She looked particularly\nunimpressed, and suddenly Styke decided he wanted to tell this story.\nHe drew his knife and pointed it at the sergeant, then raised his voice to\nbe heard throughout the mess. “If you don’t know who I am, I’m Ben\nStyke. I was a lancer back during the Fatrastan War for Independence.”\n“A Mad Lancer!” someone shouted from the back of the mess.\n“Aye, that’s right. A Mad Lancer. But this story isn’t about them. It’s\nabout Taniel Two-shot.”\nThere was a round of cheers, and the sergeant shushed everyone.\nStyke continued. “I met Taniel Two-shot about a year into the war. I’d\nheard the rumors – some hotshot powder mage, the son of Field Marshal\nTamas, making life miserable for the Kez army by killing any officer or\nPrivileged to set foot in the Tristan Basin. I’ll be honest, I expected a green-\nfaced squirt dappered up in local buckskins, strutting around the Tristan\nBasin like he owned the place. Which he was.”\nA few chuckles rose from the back of the room.\n“But by the time I got to him he was already a cold-blooded killer.

I\ncould see it in his eyes; smell the blood and powder on him from a mile\naway. He carried his father’s reputation on his shoulders like a millstone,\nbut gods be damned if he had to. They called him Two-shot, a ghost of the\nBasin, and he earned his reputation with the blood of his enemies. I wish I\ncould say I knew him well. I would have liked to. We rubbed shoulders less\nthan a week before and after the Battle of Planth. I bought him a beer,\nbecause the son of a bitch had lost his wallet in the swamp.”\nA few more laughs, these a little more enthusiastic.\n“Some of you may have heard of the Battle of Planth, having spent time\nup in that neck of the woods yourselves. The official story spins a heroic\nlast stand against all odds. What it doesn’t tell you is that the people of\nPlanth were abandoned by the interim government and only Two-shot’s\ncompany decided to stay behind to give the people a fighting chance. It was\ngoing to be him and a few hundred of his irregulars against an entire\nbrigade of Kez infantry. It was insane. He asked me to stay and” – Styke\nshrugged – “what could I say? They didn’t call me Mad Ben Styke for\nnothing.”\nStyke could see he had everyone’s undivided attention now. He might\nbe bent and old, but he knew how much soldiers loved a good story. He\nturned around slowly, pointing his knife at the Riflejacks. “Taniel Two-shot\nspent three days evening the odds by putting a bullet in the head of every\nPrivileged sorcerer in the Kez ranks. Took out a few officers, too. And a\nWarden, one of those sorcery-spawned killers. The day of the battle came\nand our little lot drew up in front of the city. The lancers took the center, the\ngarrison took the wings, and the irregulars came down the river to flank the\nenemy.” Styke looked at his knife, remembering the close fighting in the\nBasin, remembering the weight of the armor on his shoulders, the stirrups\non his feet, the power of Deshner charging unchallenged across an open\nfield. He felt tears in the corners of his eyes and blinked them away. His\nnext words were quieter, and he could see the strain on the soldiers’ faces as\nthey leaned forward to hear them.\n“You’ve never seen anything until you’ve witnessed three hundred\nlancers, wearing heavy plate you only hear about in legends, ride through\nenemy grapeshot like it was nothing more than rain. We hit them hard in the\ncenter and the garrison came in after us. I broke my lance on a Kez gunner\nand lost one of my swords fighting a colonel. It was as bloody a melee as I\ncan remember, and we cut our way through to the general’s bodyguard all\nthe way to the rear.\n“That’s where I saw Two-shot. He’d brought his men around to flank\nand opened fire on the enemy rear, sowing confusion. The enemy general\nbroke and ran, and me and a few of my lancers gave chase. What we didn’t\nknow was that we had pursuers of our own, and by the time we caught up"

What we didn’t\nknow was that we had pursuers of our own, and by the time we caught up\nwith the general, two Wardens had caught up with us.”\nThere was a chorus of boos. “Yeah,” Styke said. “You know those\nsorcery-spawned assholes. I bet a few of you have lost friends to them.\nWell, I lost two of my best to those trash, and I would have gone down\nmyself had Taniel not put a bullet in the head of one of those bastards. He\nsaved my life that day, and for that I’ll always be in his debt.”\nSilence lay over the mess hall for several moments before someone\nshouted, “He saved mine!”\n“And mine, too!” someone else shouted.\nThe whole hall was suddenly filled with the sound of cheers and\napplause, and Styke felt a smile tug at the corner of his mouth. It was good\nto feel that kind of brotherhood again – the respect of soldiers. He turned to\nclimb down from the table, but was stopped by a shout.\n“What happened to the other Warden?”\n“I once watched a Warden carve through thirty grenadiers before they\ntook him down!” someone else said.\n“I saw one get hit by straight shot from an eight-pounder and keep\ngoing.”\n“Shut up, everyone!” the sergeant shouted. “Yeah, Styke, what\nhappened to him?”\nEverything quieted down, the soldiers fixated on Styke. Styke’s\nattention, though, was drawn toward the door, where a concerned-looking\ninfantryman had rushed over to Lady Flint and was whispering in her ear.\nFlint stood up, gesturing to Olem, then said across the quiet hall, “There’s a\ndragonman in the muster yard. He’s looking for you.”\nStyke’s hand fell to the handle of the bone knife at his belt, then he drew\nhis own and got down from the table. “Celine,” Styke said. “Stay here.”\nStyke joined Flint outside the mess, where the white-knuckled grip on her\nsword gave away the anger behind a stony, expressionless facade.\nThe dragonman sat in the dirt just inside the fort gates, ignoring the\nguards and their lowered bayonets like a cat might ignore squawking birds\nthat he may later kill at his pleasure. He wore a heavy canvas duster, under\nwhich Styke could clearly see the rippled, dark green swamp dragon hide. A\npair of bone axes lay on the ground beside him, discarded as if unimportant.\nStyke felt a tingle on his spine at the sight of the legendary gear, and\nwondered if he’d made an enormous mistake.\n“So,” Flint said through a clenched jaw, “you weren’t spinning a yarn,\nwere you? These bastards really are in Landfall.”\nStyke resisted the urge to let out an I told you so and instead nodded.\n“What’s he doing in my camp?”\nStyke looked down at her grip on her sword. Unless he was mistaken,\nshe was more than ready to handle this herself. “I invited him.”\n“You what?”\n“I’m old. I’m crippled. I’m not chasing this bastard around Landfall. I"

I\ntold him if he wanted to get his knife back he had to come get it.”\n“What knife? You’ll forgive me for being annoyed, but the last one of\nthem I saw had just carved up forty of my men. I’m going to put a bullet in\nhis head.”\nStyke put a hand gently on Lady Flint’s arm. “This is… personal.”\n“You’re damn right it is.” Flint took a step forward.\n“No,” Styke said, pulling her back by the shoulder.\n“If you lay a hand on —”\n“If you try to keep me from doing my job,” Styke growled, “you’ll have\nto go through me and then the dragonman. You gave me a task. Let me\nfinish it.” He didn’t wait for an answer, but turned and limped toward the\ndragonman, stopping in the middle of the muster yard. He rubbed his leg,\nhoping the horngum would keep him limber enough for a fight.\nThe dragonman watched him for a few moments, lounging on his elbow\nlike he was having a country picnic. He finally got to his feet, shrugged out\nof his duster, and collected his bone axes. The swamp dragon armor\ncomprised a breastplate, leaving toned arms bare, and a skirt of leather\nstrips that went down to his knees. His legs and arms were crisscrossed with\nblack tattoos, giving an outfit that might have looked silly on another man a\nparticularly sinister effect.\nStyke took the bone knife from his belt and held it up. “Kushel, was it?”\nKushel’s eyes narrowed. “How do you know my name?”\n“You have two ways to get your knife back,” Styke said. “You can\neither tell me what these godstone things are that you’re looking for, and\nwhat designs you Dynize pricks have for Landfall, or you can fight me for\nit.”\nKushel openly scoffed. “You know a lot more than when we last spoke,\nBen Styke. What makes you think I plan on letting anyone in this\ncompound leave here alive?”\n“Your friend up in the Basin only took out forty of Flint’s men.\nImpressive for one man, I’ll grant you, but you think you’re going to handle\ntheir pissed-off friends?” Behind him, Styke could hear the soldiers pouring\nout of the mess hall and lining up to watch the confrontation. “Tell me what\nI want to hear and you’ll walk out of here without a scuff on that pretty\narmor.” Styke thought back on those Palo kids at Mama Sender’s, about\nhow they were too stupid to back down in the face of a man clearly unafraid\nof being outnumbered. He wondered if he was making the same mistake.\nProbably.\nKushel’s eyes made a slow, mechanical circuit of the yard, noting\nguards in their towers and up on the wall, and lingering on Lady Flint\nbefore finally coming to rest on Styke. Styke recognized the gears turning\nin Kushel’s head. He’d made the same calculations on a thousand different\noccasions. Can I walk out of this alive? The slight upturn at the corners of\nhis mouth said that he’d decided he could.\nWhat an arrogant prick."

    "text": "occasions. Can I walk out of this alive? The slight upturn at the corners of\nhis mouth said that he’d decided he could.\nWhat an arrogant prick.\n“Fight?” Styke asked. “You can pry this out of my old, crippled hand.”\nHe gripped the bone knife with his mangled hand and his boz knife with his\ngood, and put his weight back on his right leg. He’d barely fallen into a\nstance when the dragonman suddenly leapt forward.\nStyke had fought a lot of quick men in his time, from duelists to bona\nfide assassins. But he’d never seen someone cover twenty feet in the blink\nof an eye like that. Kushel’s axes rose and fell, the left swinging down from\noverhead, the right swooping in for Styke’s belly.\nStyke surprised both of them by catching each blow on a knife blade,\nthen blocking a second and the third. Kushel recovered quickly each time,\npulling back to strike with the speed of an adder, each new attack coming\nwith independent precision that would have marveled Styke had he the time\nto be impressed. All his focus went into reacting, catching, and redirecting,\nand for almost twenty seconds he fell back beneath a flurry of blows,\nunable to even manage a riposte. Kushel scored cuts across Styke’s arms\nand chest, and Styke barely managed to keep them from biting deep.\nStyke knew he was old and out of practice, but wondered if even in his\nprime he would have been able to match Kushel’s speed. Only the weight of\nthe weapons – Kushel’s heavier, more cumbersome axes against Styke’s\nknives – allowed him to keep up at all. The attacks came on relentlessly,\neach hit seemingly more powerful than the last, and Styke’s crippled hand\nbegan to numb from the effort of blocking them.\nThat all changed when a twinge in his wrist fouled a block, and\nKushel’s ax bit into the bone of one of Styke’s fingers. He released his grip\non the bone knife with a yell of dismay, watching it fly into the dust ahead\nof an arc of blood.\nThe next strike came for his unarmed left. Styke snatched the ax by the\nhaft and turned his fighting knife to pass beneath the blade of Kushel’s\nother ax, allowing the blade to draw a long, crimson line down his arm.\nKushel tried to stretch the advantage, pushing his ax into Styke’s chest, but\nStyke did two things at once:\nFirst, he slammed his forehead into Kushel’s nose. Second, he twisted\nhis knife and drew back. The blade slid along the polished bone haft of\nKushel’s ax and, with a final jerk, severed Kushel’s thumb and four fingers.\nThe dragonman reeled back, stunned, but even with a destroyed hand\nmanaged to dodge Styke’s next thrust. They each had one good hand and\none weapon now, and Kushel jammed the stubs of his fingers against his\nside to try to stanch the blood, doing it all without comment or cry, which in\nitself was more than a little unnerving. He came on hard, ax crashing\nagainst Styke’s knife, working inside Styke’s guard with both blade and\nhaft, leaving Styke’s chin and chest bloody and bruised."

He came on hard, ax crashing\nagainst Styke’s knife, working inside Styke’s guard with both blade and\nhaft, leaving Styke’s chin and chest bloody and bruised.\nStyke’s own crippled hand was slick with blood, and each time he tried\nto catch Kushel’s ax it slipped out of his grip until he finally managed to\nhook it with his knife and pull back.\nKushel had learned that trick, and this time let the ax go instead of\nlosing his fingers. He suddenly dropped low, kicking at Styke’s knee. Styke\ngrunted, unable to keep himself from toppling into the dust, trapping his\nknife hand beneath him as Kushel leapt on top of him. Kushel’s bloody\nfinger stumps were suddenly thrust in his face, the blood stinging his eyes,\nand Styke grasped blindly for something – anything – until he wrapped his\nfingers around the lip of Kushel’s blood-slick armor.\nHe used the grip to roll Kushel beneath him, freeing his arm, and\npressed the point of his knife firmly against Kushel’s armor before using\nevery bit of his strength to shove through the tough leather.\nKushel gave a choking sound as Styke pushed the knife to the hilt\nagainst his armor, yet still the dragonman fought on, weakening blows\npounding against Styke’s stomach and face. Styke let go of his knife and\ngrit his teeth, grasping Kushel by the head and pulling him close. “Stop.\nFighting.” Kushel spat a mouthful of blood. Styke wiped it from his face\nand got to one knee, holding Kushel down with his crippled hand and\ndrawing back the fist of his other.\n“Wait!” Flint suddenly shouted. “We need him alive!”\nStyke looked down at the knife in Kushel’s bowels and the bloody,\ndusty ground around them. With the right attention Kushel might live a day,\nmaybe two, in horrible agony. “You fought well,” he said, “but a warrior\ndoesn’t threaten a little girl.” He brought his fist down with all his might,\ncaving in the top of Kushel’s skull like an eggshell.\nStyke knelt in the gore for several moments, his chest rising and falling,\nas he tried to gather himself. Blood and brains dripped from his fingers, a\ncrimson smile in the empty eyes of the skull on his lancer’s ring. Ten years\nsince the last time he truly feared for his life in a fight. Ten years since\nanyone had matched him in strength. He was suddenly aware of the absence\nof sound, and lifted his head to see a thousand sets of eyes glued to him.\nSoldiers crowded the muster yard, watching him from the walls, and the\nroof of the staff office. A cigarette hung, unlit, from the corner of Olem’s\nopen mouth and Lady Flint regarded Styke with an appraising look, her\nmouth pressed into a hard line.\nSlowly, feeling all the aches and twinges he’d ignored during the fight\nand several dozen cuts and bruises he’d received during it, Styke got to his\nfeet. He collected one of the bone axes and walked over to Flint, holding it\nout. “For your men that died fighting this asshole’s friend.”\n“Thanks.” Flint took the ax, flipping it from side to side to examine the"

Styke wasn’t sure himself. “Tell me,” Flint said, “what did you do to\nthe second Warden? The one Two-shot didn’t kill?”\n“I punched his teeth in,” Styke said, remembering the hot breath of the\nsorcery-twisted creature and the thick muscles that moved like snakes in his\ngrip. “Then I broke his spine.”\nStyke limped toward the mess hall. He needed to get cleaned up, then\nfind Celine. Part of him hoped she hadn’t just seen that. The adrenaline\nbegan to subside and he felt sick from the absence of it and the\noverwhelming stench of death. But deep down, his heart sang.\nHe was still Mad Ben Styke, and he would not be trifled with.\nStyke was halfway to the mess hall when a voice suddenly called out\nfrom the gate. “I’m looking for Ben Styke! Where is Ben Styke?”\n“What the pit is it now?” Styke asked, turning around slowly. He came\nup short at the sight of a boy wearing a smith’s smock with the words “Fles\nand Fles Blades” emblazoned in the corner.\n“Are you Ben Styke?” the boy asked.\n“Who wants to know?”\nThe boy licked his lips, his face white. “Jackal said I could find you\nhere. It’s Old Man Fles, sir. The Blackhats, they…”\nStyke was already running past the boy, ignoring the hundred pains in\nhis body, before the boy could finish the sentence. “Olem,” he shouted over\nhis shoulder, “keep Celine safe!”\nCHAPTER 32\nV\nlora nudged the corpse of the dragonman with her foot and watched\nStyke’s back as he ran – surprisingly spry for a cripple – out the front\ngate of Loel’s Fort. “Where the pit is he going?”\n“Want me to bring him back?” Olem asked.\n“Yes. No. Shit.” Vlora stewed in her own indecision. She needed\nanswers about this thing with the Dynize, and the corpse at her feet wasn’t\ngoing to give them to her. But after seeing what Styke did to a legendary\nwarrior, she wasn’t about to send any of her men after him to tell him to\nturn around. She’d learned long ago that there were certain people you\ndidn’t bother when they were in a hurry.\n“Send someone to follow him. And get this asshole cleaned up.”\n“Right.” Olem turned to the watching soldiers. “Fall out! Nothing more\nto see here, lads. You three, take care of the body. Bring Lady Flint the\narmor and weapons. Put the body on ice.”\nVlora turned from her continued study of the dragonman to cock an\neyebrow.\n“Never know when a corpse will come in handy,” Olem said with a\nshrug."

    "text": "Vlora turned from her continued study of the dragonman to cock an\neyebrow.\n“Never know when a corpse will come in handy,” Olem said with a\nshrug.\nVlora paced nervously as the muster yard emptied and the blood was\ncleaned up. Something about Styke’s tale had her on edge, but she couldn’t\nquite place it. Maybe she was bothered by the reminder of how much of an\nimpact Taniel had on, not only her world, but everyone else’s. Maybe it\nwasn’t even the story itself, but his fight with the dragonman. Styke was no\nsorcery-enhanced powder mage. Normal men didn’t have that kind of\npower. They didn’t crush a skull with a bare fist or break a Warden’s spine.\nShe suddenly feared Styke, and she hadn’t truly feared another person for\nyears.\nMaybe she didn’t like remembering that there were still monsters in the\nworld that even she couldn’t comprehend.\nThe blood was just being scraped off the dirt of the muster yard when\nthere was a sudden commotion at the front gate. Vlora stopped her pacing\nand turned around with a scowl, only to see a handful of Blackhats appear\nat the open doors of the fort. There were two riders with Bronze Roses\nhanging from their necks, and another six Iron Roses on foot gathered\naround them. Their ranks suddenly swelled as more joined them from the\nstreet. Ten, then twenty, then thirty Blackhats crowded into the space.\nVlora’s heart was suddenly pounding. She checked her pistol and\nsword. “Someone get Olem,” she ordered, striding toward the gate.\nHer soldiers stood firm just inside the fort gate, while Blackhats shifted\nnervously, staring at the Riflejack guards like a pack of wild dogs waiting\nfor a signal. For their part her guards were stone-faced, and their sergeant –\na stubborn, flat-faced man missing an ear from enemy straight shot – was\narguing with one of the Bronze Roses.\n“Lady Flint’s orders,” Sergeant Jamenis insisted. “No one allowed\ninside Loel’s Fort without being announced first. You wait until word comes\nback from the Lady and then —”\n“It’s all right, Jamenis,” Vlora said, hurrying up behind him. “I’m right\nhere. Stand down.” Jamenis immediately stepped aside, saluting.\nThe Bronze Rose scoffed, urging his horse forward. Vlora grabbed the\nhorse’s bridle, holding up the whole mob. “I didn’t say you could enter. Can\nI help you with something, Blackhat?”\n“Your men are lucky you’re here,” the Bronze Rose responded. He\ntugged on his reins, but Vlora held firm. “Next time we won’t be so\naccommodating. This is a surprise inspection, and I have full authority to\nsearch the premises on order of the grand master.”\nVlora pursed her lips. Pushy Blackhats. This was the last thing she\nneeded today. Was this Agent Bravis’s idea of a joke? Or was this a screen\nfor her cover – hoping the Palo would see she was being pushed around by\nthe Blackhats and be more likely to trust her?\n“No one inspects my men without my say-so,” Vlora said.\n“Grand master’s orders,” the Bronze Rose said again, as if the words"

You do know what a surprise\nis, don’t you?”\nVlora looked around at her gate guard, noting the tightening of fingers\non rifles and the frowns on the faces of her men. She wondered what it\nwould take to get the respect of the locals – Palo or Blackhats – and decided\nshe’d have to live without it.\nThis could turn very ugly, very quickly. She tried to read the face of the\nBronze Rose. He was sweating heavily, even for the heat, and he kept\nshifting the reins from one hand to the other.\n“What’s going on, Blackhat? I don’t report to anyone except the Lady\nChancellor herself, and I won’t listen to the lip of a lapdog. Explain\nyourself before I shut the gates in your face.” The Bronze Rose opened his\nmouth, but Vlora continued in a reasonable tone: “And before you throw\nthreats and curses, remember that I have a brigade of the finest riflemen in\nthe world within a whistle. Keep it civil.”\nThe Bronze Rose chewed on his tongue for several moments, his face\nturning several shades of red before returning to a healthy, pink sheen.\n“We’re looking for an escaped convict named Ben Styke. Witnesses say\nthey’ve seen him entering this compound on at least two occasions. He is a\ndangerous war criminal and is to be remanded to our custody immediately.”\n“You’re shitting me.” The words slipped out before Vlora could stop\nherself, and she immediately bit down on her tongue, her mind racing.\nStyke was an escaped war criminal? A thousand little things clicked into\nplace, every interaction with Styke suddenly making all the more sense. His\ndisappearance from public life, his injuries, his desire to keep a low profile,\nhis disconnect from the modern city.\nThe initial shock passed within moments, replaced quickly by an utter\nlack of surprise, and then a cold anger in the pit of her stomach. It must\nhave all been plain to see on her face, because the Bronze Rose looked\ndown from his saddle with a smug smile.\n“If you’d just hand him over, we’ll be gone in a few moments.”\nThe Blackhats behind him all tightened their grip on their weapons. A\nlittle part of her realized they were not expecting an easy time of things, but\nthe rest of her didn’t give a damn. “Give me a moment,” she snapped,\nspinning on her heel.\nShe found Olem coming toward her across the muster yard but snatched\nhim by the shoulder and pulled him into the fort office, slamming the door\nbehind her.\n“He lied to us.”\nOlem pursed his lips. “Who?”\n“Styke. There’s a whole platoon’s worth of Blackhats standing at our\ngate demanding we hand over Styke. He’s a damned war criminal. An\nescaped convict.”\nOlem paced to the other side of the room, took out a pouch of tobacco,\nand smoothed a rolling paper on the table.\n“Olem…”\nHe held up his finger. “Hold on. I’m thinking.”"

    "text": "Olem paced to the other side of the room, took out a pouch of tobacco,\nand smoothed a rolling paper on the table.\n“Olem…”\nHe held up his finger. “Hold on. I’m thinking.”\nVlora flexed her fingers, gripping and ungripping the hilt of her sword.\nEverything was making her furious lately – it was like an angry cloud had\ndescended on her the moment she entered Landfall, preventing her from\nsorting her thoughts clearly. She had to fight through it. She had to be cold,\ncalculating. Before two weeks ago she didn’t know Styke from a swamp\ndragon. She had no reason to trust anything he said – even if he had\nfollowed her orders and tracked down the dragonman. All she had was his\nreputation, Olem’s admiration, and Taniel’s letters.\nDid she have any more reason to trust the Blackhats? They were\nnotoriously two-faced and underhanded. They existed to lie and manipulate.\nBut did they lie about this? Styke was dangerous, and it made perfect sense\nthat he’d escaped from a labor camp. But why wasn’t there a general alarm\naround the city? How was this the first Vlora had heard of it? Surely the\nnewspaper would have reported something.\n“He didn’t lie to us,” Olem suddenly said.\n“What do you mean?”\n“He just said he needed work. Never told us where he’d been, or why.\nAnd we never asked. So, technically, he never lied to us.”\n“What have I told you about using the word ‘technically’ to me?”\nOlem finished rolling a cigarette and squinted at the ceiling. “That\nyou’d kick my teeth in?”\n“Right.” Vlora ground her teeth. “I was just starting to like him. Pit, I\nwas just starting to trust him.”\n“More than you trust the Blackhats?”\n“Something I was wondering myself.” The knot of anger still sat in her\nstomach, but it had diminished to a reasonable size and Vlora felt like she\ncould approach the matter with a clear head. She took a deep breath.\n“There’s nothing we can do for him,” she said. “We’re employed by the\nstate. I could defy the Blackhats, but that mob out there means Fidelis Jes\ntakes Styke very seriously. By the end of the night we could have an army\noutside our gates.”\n“The question, then,” Olem said, “is whether we throw Styke to the\ndogs.” He lit his cigarette and within moments had filled the room with a\ncloud of smoke. So much smoke was the best sign Olem was distressed, and\nVlora didn’t blame him. He liked Styke. After Styke’s story about Taniel,\nthen the fight in the muster yard, the men were beginning to take to him as\nwell.\n“I’m not sacrificing our footing here for one man,” Vlora said quietly.\nA pained expression crossed Olem’s face. “I agree.”\nVlora and Olem returned to the front gate, where the Blackhats were\nobviously getting antsy; horses pranced, men muttered, and the Bronze\nRose grit his teeth as Vlora approached.\n“He’s not here,” Vlora said.\nWas that a bit of relief she saw in the Bronze Rose’s eyes? “Where is\nhe?” he demanded."

Ran off awhile ago. Didn’t say where he was going. You\nhave ten minutes to inspect the yard. I want Fidelis Jes to know that we\nwere unaware of Styke’s status. He’s been cut loose and I’ll give a public\norder that my men are to arrest him on sight. I don’t like being lied to.”\nThe speech seemed to satisfy the Bronze Rose, and he gave orders for\nhis men to do a quick sweep of the fort. Vlora watched them enter, loathing\nherself for letting secret police have the run of her headquarters. Once they\nwere all out of earshot, she turned to Olem.\n“Where’s the girl?”\n“Celine? Styke left her behind when he took off. I think she’s playing in\nthe mess.”\n“Hide her. I won’t let the Blackhats get their grubby hands on an\norphan.”\nOlem dashed off a quick order to two of the nearby guards and then\nreturned to Vlora’s side. She watched as her men glared down the Blackhats\nrushing around the compound, and then said quietly, “Did you send anyone\nto follow Styke?”\n“I sent one of my boys in plainclothes.”\n“Send another. I won’t risk the brigade for one man – but for a few days\nat least, Styke was one of mine. The least we can do is give him some\nwarning.”\nCHAPTER 33\nS\ntyke followed the Fles apprentice down into the Depths and through the\nwarrenlike streets of the slum, straight toward the Fles family home.\nPeople stopped and stared, then headed in the other direction or slammed\nfront doors shut as Styke passed, vacating the streets ahead of him like\nwaves rushing before the prow of a ship. The dragonman’s blood – and\nprobably more than a little of his own – dripped from Styke’s fingertips,\nleaving a steady trail, and he absently wiped his hand on his shirt from time\nto time.\nThe apprentice refused to say a word all the way to the Fles family\nhome, and when they reached the front door he could only point in mute\nhorror. The big oak door had been battered off its hinges and hung from a\nsingle hinge just inside the foyer. The house inside was dark, and Styke\nhalf-expected the apprentice to turn and flee, leaving Styke alone in some\nkind of a trap.\nThe apprentice remained close, as if loath to be alone, even if his only\ncompanion was a crippled, blood-covered giant.\nStyke drew his knife and crept inside.\nThe destruction did not stop at the front door. Every scrap of furniture –\nevery knickknack collected over a long life serving kings and commoners –\nhad been reduced to scraps. A priceless grandfather clock lay on its side,\nbroken apart by an ax; the collection of Brudanian porcelain on the\nmantelpiece had been smashed; Gurlish rugs were shredded and Kez vases\ncrushed.\nStyke squinted through the low light, taking in the wreckage.

Even the walls had been attacked, hundreds of holes\npunched through the plaster in a hurried fury. The destruction could only\nhave been more thorough if they’d set fire to the house, and only the fear of\nburning down the whole of the Depths would have stopped them.\nSomewhere within the house he could hear the sound of weeping, and that\nsound more than the ruin caused his heart to crack.\nHe felt his chest tighten, making it hard to breathe, and he croaked,\n“Where is the Old Man?”\n“In the workshop,” the apprentice said.\nFles’s workshop had received the brunt of the damage. Workbenches\nwere split, tools scattered, swords and knives bent and broken. In the center\nof it all huddled a small group – three apprentices, all of them gathered\naround a still form on the floor. The youngest of the boys, no older than\nCeline, wept openly while the other two had red eyes and trembling chins.\nStyke pushed them gently out of the way and knelt by the Old Man.\nOld Man Fles was as beat up as his home. His face was a mess of blood\nand bruises, and one arm was bent at an odd angle under him. His shirt was\nsoaked with as much blood as Styke’s, and he clutched a broken sword in\none hand. He lay where he’d fallen, the boys not daring to move him.\nStyke’s chest tightened further. He tried to speak, but satisfied himself\nwith a gesture and a grunt. “Water,” he ordered. He laid two fingers on the\nOld Man’s neck, then put his ear next to his mouth. He could feel the faint\npulse of the vein, the gentle touch of breath on his cheek. Old Man Fles was\nstill alive.\nRelief won out among all the other emotions swirling through Styke’s\nchest. He forced them all down, clearing his throat, then clearing it again,\nwhen he noticed that the Old Man’s eyes were open.\n“Big, bloody idiot,” the Old Man whispered.\n“Shut up,” Styke said. “Save your strength.”\nThe Old Man tried to roll off his bent arm. He let out a high-pitched\nmoan, then ceased his struggles. He managed to turn his head slightly,\nlooking away from Styke, eyes searching the workshop. “A lifetime’s\nwork,” he muttered.\n“Because of me,” Styke said. It was the only reason, of course. The Old\nMan paid his bribes, kept his nose clean. The Blackhats had no reason to\nattack such a highly regarded craftsman. Not unless they were trying to get\nto Styke. They must have found out the Old Man was passing him\ninformation somehow. Maybe one of the apprentices. Maybe a spy\nwatching the house. Maybe the Old Man himself had slipped up.\n“Of course it was cuz of you,” the Old Man hissed. “Always knew you\nwere bad luck.” He tried to move his arm again, unsuccessfully.\nStyke rolled the Old Man on his side gently, ignoring the protesting\nsqueal, and pulled the arm around and laid it on his chest.

It was definitely\nbroken, and would probably need to be set. Styke could do it, but he had no\nidea if the shock of it would kill the Old Man. “You summon a doctor?” he\nasked the oldest of the apprentices.\n“Just you,” the apprentice responded. “He said no doctors.”\n“Well, he’s an idiot. Go get the best surgeon in this half of the city,\nnow.”\n“No doctors,” the Old Man grunted.\n“Shut your flapper,” Styke snapped. The apprentice hesitated, looking\nfrom Styke to the Old Man and back. Styke bared his teeth. “Whatever you\nthink he’ll do to you if he gets better, I’ll do worse right now. Surgeon. Go.”\nThe apprentice fled, and Styke had the others light the lanterns and\ngather what was left of the Old Man’s bed before carrying him to it. The\nOld Man cursed Styke’s face and parentage throughout the whole process,\nthen passed out once he’d been laid still again. Styke sat on the floor by the\nbed, back against the cold manor wall, while the remaining apprentices\nbusied themselves cleaning up the workshop.\nStyke stared at the ceiling, trying to remember the last time he had\ncried. Decades, probably, and the tears weren’t coming now even if he\nwished they would. The Old Man had been the closest thing he ever had to\na mentor. He was a national treasure, a craftsman on par with the gunmaker\nHrusch, and he’d always been inviolate. No one touched him, because\neveryone wanted his blades.\n“Right,” Styke said to himself, the corner of his mouth lifting in a rueful\nsmile. “Last time I cried was when I killed that old bastard who called\nhimself my father.”\n“What are you going on about?”\n“Awake?” Styke asked.\nThe Old Man groaned. “Barely.” His voice was stronger now. “Thanks\nto you and your damned eyes. Things were going well, you know. Ibana\nbeen running the business for the last few years. Raking in the money. I was\ngoing to die a rich man. Now they’ve wrecked it all.”\n“Not all of it,” Styke said.\n“The shop at the market, too. They wrecked that last night. Found it a\nmess this morning, rushed home to find them tossing the house. There were\nthirty of the bastards, and they just kept asking where you were. Bastards.\nAll of you.”\n“Them,” Styke corrected absently. In his head, he was doing\ncalculations, figuring out who he’d have to ask to track down thirty\nBlackhats, and how hard it would be to get rid of all those bodies. Jackal\nwould probably help.\n“All of you,” the Old Man insisted, glaring at Styke. “I knew I should\nhave told you to go stuff it the moment you walked through my door. You\nwere always bad luck.”\n“Where’s Ibana?” Styke asked.\n“Still on her trip. She’ll be back in a few… few days.” The Old Man\nclosed his eyes. He was fading, and Styke hoped he was going to pass out,"

Gonna skin you alive.”\n“You already said that.”\n“Well, now I mean it. Pit. Have one of the boys wait on the edge of\ntown to warn her. Don’t want her messing with the Blackhats. I…” Fles\ntrailed off, then sullenly said, “They took my sword. The latest I was\nworking on. Didn’t even have the dignity to smash it. Stole the bloody thing\nstraight off.” The flatness in his voice alarmed Styke more than any\nemotion, but the Old Man’s eyes were closed against Styke’s worrying\nglance.\n“Rest,” Styke said, climbing to his feet.\n“Don’t do it,” Fles responded.\n“Eh?”\n“Don’t do that fool thing you’re thinking about doing.”\n“I’m not thinking about doing anything,” Styke said. “Gotta make sure\nyou’re okay.”\n“Take me for a fool?”\nIn truth, Styke hadn’t been considering much of anything. He wondered\nwhere the Blackhats would head next, and hoped Jackal was able to lie low.\nHe considered sending one of the apprentices to Lady Flint to ask her to\nhide Celine, but he didn’t want to get her involved in this. Whatever “this”\nwas. Styke wasn’t entirely sure, though a thought had crept into his head –\nthe very one Fles was telling him not to consider – and he decided\nimmediately on his course of action.\n“No,” he said quietly. “I never took you for a fool.” When there was no\nanswer he looked down to find Fles had passed out again. He checked to\nmake certain the Old Man’s heart was still beating, then headed toward the\nworkshop, only to stop in the great room, hand on the handle of his knife. A\nfigure stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the lamplit street.\nThe figure turned his face toward the light. It was Colonel Olem,\nwearing plain frontiersman’s clothes and a felt half hat. His usual cigarette\nwas gone, replaced by a twig. He squinted through the dim light at Styke,\nthen stepped outside and took a long, hard look at the placard beside the\ndoor.\n“Friend of yours?” he asked.\nStyke grunted an affirmative.\nOlem chewed aggressively on the twig. “Blackhats do this?” he asked.\nStyke felt his heart skip a beat. “How’d you know?”\n“Gang of ’em showed up at Loel’s Fort right after you left.”\n“Looking for me?”\n“Looking for you,” Olem echoed.\nSo much for not dragging Lady Flint into this. When it rained, his sister\nused to say, it poured. And shit was falling from the sky right now. “So she\nknows.”\n“Knows that you’re a war criminal?” Olem said.\nStyke took two strides forward, reaching for his knife, before he\nrealized that Olem had staged it as a question, not a statement. Styke\ngrowled in the back of his throat. “I’m no war criminal. Not by any court in"

Convicted of ignoring orders, yes. But any crime I’ve committed\nwas for this country, and I’ll ask you not to repeat that accusation.”\nOlem considered him, unflinching, looking him up and down. Styke\nthought of the Palo clearing the streets and slamming their doors as he\npassed and considered what he must have looked like – a giant, caked in\nblood, covered in a dozen nicks and cuts, his shirt sliced open. It all hurt; a\nfresh, wakeful pain that he’d ignored since the moment the apprentice had\nurgently called his name. Olem seemed suitably impressed, but unafraid,\nand Styke was struck by a random thought – the former bodyguard of the\nlegendary Field Marshal Tamas was probably a son of a bitch to play\nagainst in cards.\n“That seems fair,” Olem said. “I’ve heard a lot about you. Read a few\nbooks. Talked to your old friends. You don’t strike me as a war criminal.”\n“Then why are you here?” Styke asked. Olem wasn’t stupid. If he was\nhere to express Flint’s displeasure, or to arrest Styke in the name of the\nLady Chancellor, he would be in uniform, and probably backed by a whole\nregiment.\nOlem held out his hand. “To give you this.”\nStyke took a stack of krana notes, rolling it between his fingers,\ninadvertently smearing them in blood. He handed them back. “I don’t want\nit.”\n“Five thousand krana. It’s your pay for two weeks’ work.”\n“I didn’t earn five thousand krana.”\n“And a little extra on the side,” Olem admitted.\nStyke swallowed a lump in his throat. Never mind that his purpose had\nbeen to infiltrate the Riflejacks. He was beginning to like them, and their\ncommanding officer. He’d been beginning to fit in, feel like a real soldier\nagain. “Flint is cutting me loose?”\n“Sorry,” Olem said, and sounded like he meant it. He held out the\nmoney again.\n“Give it to Celine when she’s old enough,” Styke said, pushing past\nOlem. “Take care of her for me. Keep her out of the Blackhats’ hands.” It\nwas a lot to ask, and he expected Olem to shake his head.\nInstead, Olem said softly, “You’re not taking her with you?”\n“Not where I’m going.” The Old Man was right. Styke was going to be\nan idiot. But it was the only route he could foresee, the only stratagem that\ndidn’t end with everyone he’d ever known tortured by the Blackhats. He\npaused in the street just outside the Fles manor and turned back to Olem. “I\ndidn’t escape from the labor camp,” he said. “I only tried once, and\nhalfheartedly at that.”\n“Why not?” Olem asked. “I saw what you did to that dragonman.”\nStyke looked at the blood on his fingers, remembering all the beatings\nhe’d endured silently at the hands of the labor camp guards.

He\nremembered every sleepless night from the ache of his old wounds, every\nday in the sun pulling sledges or mucking out trenches in the marshes.\n“Because I didn’t want my life to end up like this. I’m a wolf, not a cur, and\nI won’t flee for the rest of my life. Better to serve my sentence and be\nreleased on my own free will than to escape. Whatever they’ve done to me,\nI’m still Ben Styke, and I’ve got my pride.\n“I didn’t escape,” he continued. “I was released. I thought maybe I was\nreally free. That I could create a new life. But the Lady Chancellor only\nfears what she can’t control, and so…” He shrugged, then began to trudge\ndown the street. “I like Lady Flint. When you see her next time, tell her to\nbe wary of a man named Gregious Tampo.”\n“You know Tampo?” Olem asked sharply.\n“Not really,” Styke said without turning around. “But he’s the one who\nreleased me from the camps.”\n“Where are you going? What are you going to do?” Olem called after\nhim.\n“I’m going to make an appointment to kill a man.”\nCHAPTER 34\nM\nichel was left alone in the tiny office above the Palo Herald printshop.\nHis hands and feet were tied, his knife and knuckledusters taken by the\nbig Palo woman, and the door to the office locked from the outside for good\nmeasure. His jaw ached and head pounded from the two blows to his head,\nand his ribs and chest hurt from a handful of kicks and punches they’d\nthrown in when he tried to talk his way out of… whatever it was they had\nplanned for him. His bribery attempt had gone little better, earning him a\ncut over his ear.\nHe’d expected the beatings to begin immediately and continue until he\nbroke down and told them who he was and what he worked for, but the\nmoment they found his Silver Rose they trussed him up like a hog and\ncarried him up to the office. He could see one of the Palo, a middle-aged\nman with a fierce scar beneath one eye, standing guard just outside.\nHe could probably pick through his ropes. He might even be able to\njimmy the lock with something he found in the office. But he didn’t think\nhis chances of taking on a Palo guard – maybe even more than one – were\nvery good with his head swimming.\nIf he lived through this, he was going to be very sore in the morning.\nThe hours crawled along as midday came and went, the tiny room\nheating up to an unbearable degree. Sweat poured from every pore, leaving\nhim completely soaked through. He considered plan after plan, discarding\neach for the high probability of failure. He’d always been better at talking\nthan running or fighting, and even though they’d discovered his Silver Rose\nhe was still willing to do just that. If he couldn’t bribe them or convince\nthem to let him go, maybe he could get them to ransom him back to the\nMillinery.\nHaving to be ransomed back to the Millinery would send his career into\na tailspin.

Of course, a destroyed career was better than winding up in\nseveral pieces on Fidelis Jes’s desk…\nHe considered every possible story he could tell his captors, and none of\nthem seemed promising. His head continued to pound, his tongue dry. He\nwas beginning to think he would faint when there was a brief commotion\nfrom downstairs and then slow, even steps on the stairs outside the office.\nHe wasn’t sure how long it had been since he’d been captured, but he hoped\nthey were going to move him. Another minute in this heat would kill him\nsure as torture.\nThe door opened, and Michel looked up to see a man in a fine black\nsuit, top hat in one hand and cane in the other. He was tall, thin, with black\nhair and a neatly trimmed mustache. Michel felt his heart drop into his\nstomach.\nTampo. Gregious Tampo. Michel noted the irony that after all this time\nand effort spent in hunting the bastard he had wound up on the wrong end\nof what would surely be a long and painful torture session. He licked his\nlips, wondering how long he would be able to hold out against questioning.\nNot long, probably. He’d always suspected that deep down, he was a\ncoward.\nGuess it was time to find out.\nTampo frowned at Michel, squinted in the low light, then pulled out a\nsnuff box and took a pinch, holding his fingers delicately beneath his nose\nand sniffing. He looked again and sighed. “Get him some tea.”\nA few moments later Michel’s arms were unbound and he gratefully\nchugged the contents of a waterskin, far too thirsty to care if it was\npoisoned. Tampo watched him drink, then turned and headed back\ndownstairs, leaving Michel alone and unguarded. Hesitantly, not sure what\nkind of trap could be worse than his current predicament, Michel followed\nhim down to the printshop.\nThe Palo made themselves scarce at a nod from Tampo, and Tampo\nturned to face Michel, leaning casually against the printing press in the\ncenter of the room. Michel glanced around furtively, trying to work out an\nescape route. The Palo were probably within earshot, but if Michel could\nget the drop on Tampo maybe he could make it back to his cab just outside\nthe city.\nIf the cab was still waiting.\nFuzzy-headed and sore, Michel didn’t like his chances of escape.\nTampo’s expression was neutral, even friendly, and Michel wondered\nwhether he was going to get a chance to talk his way out of this after all.\n“This is awkward,” Tampo finally said.\n“I imagine it is, isn’t it?” Michel responded.\n“Has it been you that’s been after me all this time?”\nMichel frowned at Tampo. This was the first time he’d actually seen\nhim, but there was something awfully familiar about him, like he was a\nchildhood friend long forgotten. “I’ve been on the case for about eight\ndays,” he responded.\n“Shit,” Tampo said. He picked his teeth with one immaculately clean\nfingernail, then knocked his cane against the base of the printing press. He\nseemed more annoyed than angry, and Michel was wondering when the"

He\nseemed more annoyed than angry, and Michel was wondering when the\nother shoe would drop. “Well, I suppose there’s really nothing we can do\nabout it, is there?”\nMichel was deeply confused. He’d half-expected Tampo to come in\nswinging that cane. Not for him to offer him tea and a double-helping of\nmild annoyance. Tampo shook his head, pinched the bridge of his nose, and\nremained that way for several seconds. Michel was just beginning to think\nsomething was wrong when Tampo’s face… changed.\nThe change was not enormous. His eyes grew a little wider apart. His\nhair suddenly seemed to have some premature gray, and his mustache\ndisappeared entirely. His nose became a little more hawkish, his\ncheekbones higher and haughtier, his lips thinner. In the course of about\nfive seconds, Tampo became an entirely different man. The two men –\nTampo, and the one that now stood before Michel – could have been\ncousins, but they would never have been mistaken for each other.\nAnd Michel immediately knew why Tampo was so frustrated. He found\nhimself sighing, too, partly in relief, partly at the stupidity of it all.\n“Hello, Taniel,” Michel said. “Why the pit didn’t you tell me you were\ngoing to print a bloody pamphlet?”\nCHAPTER 35\nS\ntyke entered the front gate of the Millinery, unopposed. A guard, slack-\njawed, watched him limp through the archway, then yelled something\nunintelligible over his shoulder as Styke approached the old man sitting\nwatch behind a counter just outside the gate. The old Blackhat snoozed\nquietly, slumped sideways in his chair, notebook slipping from his fingers.\n“I understand Fidelis Jes takes appointments for fights,” Styke said.\nThe old Blackhat snorted, rubbed his nose, and pushed himself upright\nin his chair while stifling a yawn. “Right, right,” he said. “I’ll take your\nname. Wait is a couple weeks. You can back out anytime before then if your\nblood cools.”\n“I’m going to fight him today.”\nThe old Blackhat’s eyelids fluttered and he scowled down at his\nnotebook. “Don’t you read the papers? The grand master only duels during\nthe mornings, and he’s all booked up. No exceptions.”\n“He’ll make an exception for me.” Styke picked at the dried blood on\nhis arms, watching it flake off and fall to the cobbles. He wondered if Old\nMan Fles would make it to the morning, and if it was cruel of him to allow\nthe Old Man to die alone. But he wouldn’t be alone, Styke reasoned with\nhimself. Fles would die surrounded by friends. Unlike Styke, who\nwondered briefly if he’d always been destined to die surrounded by\nenemies.\n“Hilarious,” the old Blackhat said. “I’ll take your name and address and\nwe’ll let you know when to keep your appointment.”\n“Benjamin Styke.

From somewhere inside the\nMillinery came the sound of shouting, and the watchman finally looked up,\nmouth hanging open at Styke’s appearance. “Oh,” he said breathlessly. “It’s\nyou.”\n“It’s me,” Styke confirmed. “Tell Fidelis Jes I’m going to make a hand\npuppet out of his worthless corpse. I’ve told a dozen newspapers I’m on my\nway here, so if he tries to make me disappear the whole city will know him\nfor a bloody coward.” A lie, but a plausible one.\nThe guard lurched from his chair and backed away from Styke. “I’ll, uh,\ngive him the message. Give me just a few… moments.” He bolted into the\nMillinery. The shouting got closer, and Styke was soon aware of the heavy\ntromp of feet. The narrow gate filled with faces as Blackhats crowded just\ninside, bristling with weapons from blunderbusses to cudgels. Feet shuffled\nand men jostled for position as they tried to look intimidating – while they\nstayed well out of arm’s reach.\nStyke leaned against the watchman’s post, cleaning his nails and\ncontemplating his mortality.\nHe did not expect to leave the Millinery alive. He didn’t feel any real\nfear – he’d never desired death, but the prospect had never particularly\nphased him, either. He was here to die, and he suspected it would be by the\nhands of the very mob gathered just inside. He’d take a few of them with\nhim, if he could, but his only real goal was to go down with bits of Fidelis\nJes’s brains on his shirt.\nHe pictured Fidelis Jes as he last saw him – thin, muscular, his neck a\nlittle too thick and his head a little too narrow, making him look like a nub\nof pencil stuck on a body, looking smug as he watched Styke’s firing squad\ntake aim. Styke froze that smile in his mind’s eye and wondered what it\nwould look like when he popped Jes’s head between his palms like a ripe\nmelon. The Blackhats would gun him down as soon as their leader expired,\nbut Styke would die with a grin.\nHe had a few regrets. He wished he hadn’t been forced to double-time\nLady Flint. He regretted not saying he was sorry to Ibana. He wanted to\nknow what Tampo’s real plans were for Landfall.\nHe wished he could have watched Celine grow up.\n“Colonel Styke?” a voice asked.\nStyke came out of his reverie to find a woman of about thirty standing\nbetween him and the mob of Blackhats. “Who are you?”\n“My name is Dellina. I’m the grand master’s secretary. I understand\nyou’re here about personal combat with the grand master.”\n“I have no interest in waiting.”\n“Of course,” Dellina said, smiling professionally. If she was put off by\nhis bloody state, she didn’t show it. “And we have no intention of keeping\nyou waiting. The grand master is in a meeting right now but he left strict\ninstructions to be summoned when you arrived. He should be here\nanytime.”"

He should be here\nanytime.”\nStyke felt a knot form in his stomach. “He was expecting me.”\n“Yes, Colonel.”\nStyke felt the sudden kick to the ribs that accompanied the realization\nthat he’d been manipulated. Of course. He’d played right into Jes’s hands.\nInstead of forcing Jes to chase him around Landfall, Styke strode straight\ninto the Millinery and offered himself up like a damned dunce.\nThat was the foolish thing Old Man Fles had been referring to.\nNo backing out now. Styke felt a little bit stupid, but he was not afraid.\nHe was going to die, and Jes would die along with him. The feeling gave\nhim some comfort, but he nonetheless kept his knife hand ready as Dellina\nparted the mob of Blackhats and led him through the Millinery. The mob\ndogged their heels, then disappeared as he was led into a small, nondescript\ncourtyard toward the back of the building. The Blackhats reappeared a few\nmoments later, gathered around the catwalk above the courtyard, watching\nhim like so many vultures.\n“May I offer you any fruit or wine?” Dellina asked politely.\n“No.” Styke shrugged out of his old cavalry jacket and handed it to\nDellina, who took it without comment.\n“And what weapons shall you be fighting with today?”\nStyke looked around the courtyard. The cobbles showed regular\nscrubbing, but only in particular splotches, likely from cleaning up blood.\nHe caught the glint of metal down one arched hallway, and spied a weapon\nrack with dozens of swords, knives, pistols, and muskets, all polished and\non display. Styke tapped his knife.\n“Knives it is,” Dellina said.\nThis was where Fidelis Jes did his killing, and if the newspapers were\nany indication, he’d become damned good at it. Styke wondered if he\nshould be feeling fear right about now, but dismissed the thought. He’d not\nfelt it when he charged fifteen thousand infantry in the Battle of Landfall,\nnor when he charged a full brigade at Planth, backed only by Two-shot’s\nirregulars and a small-town garrison. He’d not felt fear once during the war,\nand he refused to surrender to it now.\n“Benjamin Styke,” a voice called.\nStyke felt his heart soar as Fidelis Jes strolled down a short run of steps\nat the far end of the courtyard. Seeing him approach was like witnessing the\narrival of an old friend – if you planned on murdering him painfully – and\nStyke drummed the fingers of his good hand on the hilt of his knife,\nhumming to himself.\nThis was it. A moment he’d dreamed about for ten years.\n“Been a long time,” Fidelis Jes said, falling into a soldier’s stance about\nten feet away.\n“Too long,” Styke said quietly. “And not long enough.”\nIf Styke was a wreck of a human being, just a shadow of his former self,\nFidelis Jes had done nothing but grow stronger and better-looking.

He still had that ridiculously thick neck\nand stupidly thin head, but they seemed less important when the rest of his\nbody was a godlike specimen. Jes had not allowed himself to grow fat or\nlazy in his position. Styke hated him a little for that, but as far as hate went\nit was like throwing a glass of water into the ocean.\nJes grinned like he was about to carve up a particularly succulent turkey.\n“Pit, you’re uglier than I remember. Bullet didn’t help your face, did it? Or\nyour back or knee.” He clicked his tongue, shaking his head. “The years\nhave not been kind to you, my friend.”\n“Were we ever friends?” Styke asked. For a moment, he genuinely\ncouldn’t remember.\n“Allies.”\n“Not the same thing.”\n“I suppose that’s true,” Jes admitted. He squinted at Styke. “Decided\nyou were ready to die, did you?”\nStyke tapped on the hilt of his knife. “Everyone dies sooner or later.” He\nstudied Jes, searching his eyes and face. They had witnesses – dozens of\nBlackhats gathered on the catwalks above them – and Jes looked nothing\nbut the confident blowhard that he’d always been. But Styke could see a\ncrack in the armor; Jes’s eyes were too inviting, his smile a little too wide.\nHe bounced on his heels a little too eagerly.\nHe was nervous. As he should be.\n“Knives, is it?” Jes asked. His voice cracked slightly, but he cleared his\nthroat and repeated the question.\n“Yes, sir,” Dellina responded. She hurried down the side hall where\nStyke had spotted the weapon rack and returned with a fixed-blade knife\njust as big and heavy as Styke’s. She offered it to Jes handle-first and he\ndrew it with one swift motion. Styke expected him to look ridiculous with\nsuch a big knife, but Jes gave it a few comfortable, expert flourishes and\nthen began to stretch his arms and legs, like a gymnast readying for a\nperformance.\n“I feel like there’s so much to say,” Jes said.\nStyke jerked his knife from its scabbard and held it loosely in his good\nhand. “Not really.”\n“You don’t want to ask about what I’ve accomplished while you were\nlocked up? You don’t want to hear about Fatrasta’s wealth? Her glory? You\ndon’t want to ask after Lindet?”\n“I see a rotten city with a fresh coat of paint,” Styke said, considering\nhis words carefully. “Lindet was always better at gaining power than she\nwas at actually doing anything decent with it.”\n“Ripe words coming from you, Benjamin.”\nStyke shrugged. “I never claimed to do anything but destroy. You and\nLindet talked the talk.”\n“Maybe if you’d given talk a chance you’d be something grand. Not a\nburned-out old cripple.” The words were spoken in a gentle tone, but Styke\ncould hear the dagger behind them.

Jes’s face smiled, but his eyes had\nbegun to smolder, and Styke wondered if this performance was for the\nBlackhats watching them, or for Jes himself.\n“You wanted me to kill kids,” Styke said, loud enough the Blackhats\ncould hear it.\n“Everyone has to die,” Jes responded without the slightest bit of\nremorse. “You just said so yourself. You made sure everyone knew that you\nwere the monster Fatrasta needed, until it was inconvenient to you.”\n“Slaughtering children is inconvenient.”\n“Not to a real soldier,” Jes shot back. “A real soldier follows orders.”\n“Like you? You’ve never been a soldier. Just Lindet’s shadow, with no\nreal substance of your own, wielding a stiletto in the darkness and killing\nfools every morning to try to convince yourself you’re good enough. You’re\nnot. You never have been. One day your seams will loosen and the stink\nwill escape and Lindet will toss you on the midden pile the same way she\ndid me.”\nJes’s head snapped back, the smiling calm replaced by bared teeth. He\nswished his knife through the air in a figure eight and began to pace back\nand forth. The secretary made herself scarce, withdrawing to the edge of the\ncourtyard.\n“Benjamin Styke,” Jes spat. “So clever. So strong. But you can’t even\nprotect your friends. Tell me, what drove you here? Burning down\nGamble’s bar? Smashing up Fles Blades? Wrecking Sunin’s livery? Killing\nthat old buzzard Hovenson? I wasn’t sure what would get your attention, so\nI decided to do it all at once.”\nStyke forced his face to remain stony but felt a catch in his throat. Jes\nlisted off a dozen more names and the ills his Blackhats had done to them,\npresumably that very morning. They were all old friends and officers,\npeople who might have shown him succor in time of need. Styke’s stomach\ntied itself in knots and he could only think of a handful of names that\nweren’t on the list, Jackal among them. He hadn’t even made contact with\nany of these people aside from Fles, to try to protect them from possible\nreprisal, but even that hadn’t been enough.\nAll his lancers had suffered because of him.\n“So,” Jes asked, continuing to pace, “which was it?”\nStyke rolled his wrist, loosening his knife hand. “Honestly, I didn’t even\nknow about any of that. I just woke up this morning and decided I’d turn\nyour rib cage into a hat.”\nJes did a little skip and jump. He wasn’t playing anymore. His eyes had\ngrown focused, studious, and they darted from Styke’s face, to his bad\nhand, to his crippled leg. “Whose blood are you wearing?” he demanded.\nStyke gave him a toothy grin. “Wouldn’t you like to know?”\n“No matter. I’ll find out after I’ve cleaned this up.”\nJes surged forward without warning, dropping into a knife fighter’s\nstance and slashing at Styke’s face.

Styke heard the clang of their blades\nand felt the impact all the way up his arm. He stepped sideways, swiping\nwith his left hand only to receive a shallow cut on his forearm for his\nefforts. They separated, clashed again, separated, then circled each other\nwarily, Jes’s eyes narrowed with concentration.\nThe dragonman had been furiously strong and fast, but he’d made one\nmistake: He’d let Styke grapple with him. Jes remained out of arm’s reach,\nleading with his blade. He was cautious and measured, somehow seeming\nto watch Styke’s legwork, knife hand, and eyes all at once. Jes’s movements\nhad the finesse of someone who killed for art, rather than survival, and he\ncould read Styke’s movements like a book.\nThey continued to circle for several moments. Styke sliced the air in\nfigure eights in front of Jes’s face, while Jes did the same to him, both\nattempting to convince the other of a feint. Styke managed to nick Jes’s\narm. Jes cut Styke’s middle knuckle. The blades crashed and clanged off\neach other, and Styke noted the deep gouges forming in the blade of Jes’s\nknife – and the lack of the same in his own.\nShould have bought a Fles blade.\nThe errant thought cost Styke his focus, then his footing. He stumbled\nback to regain it, swiping erratically to keep Jes at bay. Jes followed closely,\nhis knife taking a gouge out of Styke’s left thigh before Styke could readjust\nhimself and lash back, drawing a long, deep cut down Jes’s arm.\nTo his surprise, Jes leaned into the cut and, unbelievably, dropped his\nknife. He caught it with the other hand, out of sight below Styke’s own arm,\nand then slashed upward, catching Styke’s chest with the hooked tip of his\nknife and then bringing it across below Styke’s good hand. Styke felt his\nfingers go suddenly numb, the hilt slipping from his grip. He tried to catch\nit, leaning forward, only to feel a hard pinch on his thigh.\nHe looked down as Jes jerked the thick blade out of Styke’s leg. Styke\nlost his footing, holding his wrist, and collapsed backward.\nThe whole sequence had taken just a few heartbeats. Styke felt tears in\nhis eyes and his brain trying to catch up. He was on his back, the tendon of\nhis good hand slit, his right leg on fire.\nIt wasn’t supposed to happen this way. He was supposed to grab Jes,\neven if he took a knife to the gut to do it, and then choke the life out of him\nin a few moments. They were going to die together, and Styke was going to\nbe happy to go out that way. Instead, he heard the clatter of his knife being\nkicked across the cobbles and then saw Jes’s face hovering above him.\nStyke snatched upward with his crippled hand. Jes batted it away\nbrutally with the blade, nearly severing a finger, then reversed his grip and\nslammed his knife down into Styke’s shoulder.\n“Scream,” Jes said quietly.\nStyke grunted.

He swallowed a\nsob, wishing Jes would lean over closely so he could bite his nose off. But\nJes just lowered himself to one knee beside him, slowly twisting the knife\ndeeper and deeper.\n“I said scream!”\nEvery breath was ragged now. Styke could feel every little cut needle\nsharp, and his leg and arm refused to respond to any commands. He\nremembered the dying dragonman, and bit his own lip hard and spat the\nblood into Jes’s face. Jes jerked the knife out of Styke’s shoulder and\npressed the pitted blade against his throat.\nStyke felt the raw edge and silently urged Jes to slice deep.\n“You gonna finish it?” he hissed.\nAnd just like that, the blade was withdrawn. Jes stood up and left\nStyke’s field of vision. Styke closed his eyes, forcing himself to swallow.\nThis is how it’ll be, then? Jes is going to let me bleed out on the Blackhat\ncobbles? Styke wrestled with the thought, trying to give his death some sort\nof value. This wasn’t how it was supposed to happen.\nBut, he supposed, this was a soldier’s death. Slowly, painfully, drop by\ndrop on the battlefield.\nA bad way to go. Somehow, though, a proper one.\n“Pick him up,” Jes suddenly ordered.\nStyke’s eyes shot open. Jes stood above him again, this time surrounded\nby his Blackhats. Hands reached down and grasped Styke, forcing him up\nto his feet, half-carrying, half-dragging him toward the edge of the\ncourtyard before dumping him unceremoniously facedown in a\nwheelbarrow. He could smell rust, old blood, and rotten flesh.\nThere was a sudden silence, and then he heard Jes’s voice right beside\nhis ear.\n“You once terrified me,” Jes whispered. “But now that seems like a bad\ndream. I can’t kill you. She won’t allow it. But I can make sure that your\nlegend dies before you do.” Jes’s presence withdrew, and Styke heard him\nsay in a loud voice, “Take this piece of trash back to Sweetwallow Labor\nCamp. And make sure he stays there.”\nCHAPTER 36\nV\nlora stood at attention in the office of the grand master of Fatrasta’s\nsecret police and wondered when she’d last had to salute someone.\nYears, certainly, maybe even all the way back to the Adran-Kez War. That\nwas the last time any general in the room had outranked her, and the last\ntime Adro had a field marshal.\nShe certainly wasn’t going to give a trumped-up spy that honor, no\nmatter how annoyed he looked.\nFidelis Jes’s brow was beaded with sweat. He wore a clean shirt, but she\ncould see blood soaking through it in more than one place. He fidgeted in\nhis chair, looking from her to the immense knife on his desk and back again\nas if she was expected to explain its presence.\nShe recognized that knife.

Ben Styke had used it to kill a dragonman.\n“You asked for me?” she said lightly.\nFidelis Jes swept the knife off his desk and deposited it in a drawer\nbefore clearing his throat. Vlora noted the enormous ring on the thumb of\nhis left hand, worn over the glove so it wouldn’t fall off. Styke’s skull ring.\n“Lady Flint, I understand that you’ve been employing convicted war\ncriminal Benjamin Styke. I want an explanation and I want it now.”\n“I’m not sure an explanation is warranted,” Vlora responded coolly. She\ndidn’t like Jes’s tone one bit, but she wasn’t in a mood to get combative.\nShe had too much on her plate right now to risk pissing off the Lady\nChancellor’s right-hand man. Though by the looks of things, she was\nalready too late on that account.\nJes slammed his palm on his desk. Behind her, Vlora heard his secretary\njump and made a mental note of the fact. Jes was not known for outbursts.\n“You have been employing an enemy of the state. If that does not warrant\nan explanation would you care to tell me what does?”\n“I was employing an old, crippled soldier. He came to me asking for a\njob and with a name like that, who wouldn’t hire him on?” Vlora had a\nsudden suspicion and voiced it. “Tell me, is it even public record that Styke\nis a war criminal? Because I don’t hire on strangers without looking into\ntheir background and all my men could find was that he disappeared ten\nyears ago.”\n“Don’t get smart with me, General.”\n“Don’t waste my time.”\nThere was a slight intake of breath behind her and Fidelis Jes’s eyes\nnarrowed. Vlora ground her teeth, annoyed with herself. She was letting her\ntemper get the better of her – but if there was one thing she wouldn’t stand\nit was being condescended to.\n“Before lecturing me on what I should or shouldn’t know,” Vlora said\nquietly, “consider your own practice of censorship and misinformation. I’m\nno stranger to propaganda but you Blackhats have taken it to an art. You\nshouldn’t be surprised when someone is unaware of information you\npurposefully destroyed. Now, I’ve purged Styke’s name from the books of\nmy mercenary company and ordered my men to arrest him the moment he’s\nspotted. He’s one man. If you’re unsatisfied with my efforts to reconcile the\nsituation I’ll exercise the withdrawal clause of my contract and my men will\nbe out of the city by the end of the week.”\nFidelis Jes looked like he’d swallowed something sour. He clenched and\nunclenched one fist on the desk, looking at the thick ring on his thumb, then\nsaid, “I don’t think that’s necessary.”\n“I’m glad to hear that. I’ve quite enjoyed working with the Fatrastan\ngovernment and I like to keep a good thing going.” It was a bald-faced lie,\nbut Vlora had learned that a lie or two did wonders for professional\nrelationships. Besides, she’d made her point: She would not be called in\nhere and bullied like a schoolgirl.\n“Then you’ll tell me what you hired Styke for, and all of his actions\nwhile in your employ.”"

    "text": "here and bullied like a schoolgirl.\n“Then you’ll tell me what you hired Styke for, and all of his actions\nwhile in your employ.”\nPerhaps her point hadn’t been made clearly enough. Vlora wondered\njust what made Styke so important. He was incredibly dangerous; she’d\nseen that with her own eyes. But he was still just one man. And if Jes had\nhis knife and ring, it must mean that Jes had him. Was Styke already dead?\n“We hired him to have an insider’s view of the city; to keep someone on\nhand who could do dirty work for us if the need arose.”\n“And did it?”\n“I sent him chasing ghosts. He was still working on that first assignment\nas of this afternoon.”\nJes eyed her for several long moments. He seemed to have gotten\ncontrol of himself, and he dabbed his forehead gently with a handkerchief\nbefore folding it and setting it aside. “Details.”\n“I sent him chasing after the Dynize,” Vlora said. It was close enough to\nthe truth. She had no interest in explaining the last two weeks to Jes. She\nhad work to do, and she was itching to get out of this office.\n“What?” Jes said sharply, his eyes snapping up to hers. “What do you\nknow about the Dynize?”\nThe intensity with which he asked made Vlora raise her eyebrows.\nApparently not as much as you. “Very little. Just that they’ve installed spies\nin Greenfire Depths.”\n“Preposterous.”\nYou’re either much worse at your job than I’ve been led to believe, or\nyou’re playing me for a fool. Either way I don’t like it. “We don’t know why\nor how many, but it’s been interfering with my work, so I set Styke to the\ntask of dealing with it. Now that he’s out of the picture, I’ll have to put\nsome of my own men on the job.”\n“No,” Jes said. “You’re to ignore the Dynize. Whatever you do, do not\nengage them directly.”\nA bit late for that. And what happened to preposterous? “They’re\ninterfering with my work,” Vlora repeated.\n“You’ll have to just deal with it,” Jes said. “The Dynize are to be left\nunmolested.”\nVlora wondered what kind of plans Jes had for the Dynize. Obviously\nhe knew about their presence. Was he watching them? Trying to trap them?\nWere they here on the behest of the Blackhats to stir up trouble in Greenfire\nDepths? What the Blackhats had planned for the Dynize was just as murky\nas what the Dynize themselves were up to, but it made her plenty angry.\n“Even,” she asked, “if dragonmen are stalking and murdering my soldiers?”\n“Dragonmen?” Jes repeated quietly to himself. He sounded genuinely\nsurprised, and Vlora felt a jolt of smug satisfaction. “No,” he finally said.\n“Steer clear of them.”\nVlora snorted. This was not how she wanted this conversation to go.\nShe was not to be bait in some game being played out of her sight. “Why?”\n“That’s not your concern.”\n“It is my concern. My men are dying.”\n“They’re soldiers,” Jes said coldly. “That’s what they do.” Vlora opened"

My men are dying.”\n“They’re soldiers,” Jes said coldly. “That’s what they do.” Vlora opened\nher mouth, but before she could respond, Jes went on. “What is your\nconcern is the apprehension of Mama Palo. Your Blackhat liaison reports\nthat you have your men tearing down and rebuilding entire tenements\ninstead of searching for Mama Palo.”\n“In addition to searching for Mama Palo,” Vlora corrected.\n“Do you take me for an idiot?”\n“No. I take you for someone who understands the nuance of a long-term\nplan.” The words slipped out, and Vlora once again cursed herself for\nletting her temper get the better of her.\n“You’re trying my patience, Lady Flint.”\n“Should that bother me?” Vlora asked. “You gave me an assignment.\nYou gave me two months. I’m less than two weeks in and you’re\ndemanding results. I’m not sure what you expect.”\n“I expect someone of your reputation to accomplish your work ahead of\nschedule. And yes, trying my patience should bother you. You act as if you\nown this place, Lady Flint. You act as if you’re in Adro, among your friends\nand admirers. You are not. You’re nothing but a cog in the wheel here, and I\nexpect you to know your place.”\n“Are you threatening me, Fidelis Jes?”\n“I don’t threaten people, General. I just remind them who I am.”\nVlora bit back a retort. The last thing she needed was a dick-measuring\ncontest. Fidelis Jes was famous for his early morning duels, as well as his\nrule against using sorcery. She had no doubt that a fight between them\nwithout sorcery would be a close one. But she was a powder mage. A sniff\nof black powder and she would tear through his Blackhats like so much\nrabble. Perhaps, she thought to herself, I’ve become too arrogant. Perhaps I\nneed to be cautious. She glanced at the ring on his thumb. “Is Styke still at\nlarge?”\n“Styke has been dealt with.”\nVlora reappraised the blood soaking through his clean shirt and the\nsweat on his brow when she first entered. Even now he was still flushed.\nShe felt a moment of disquiet. Did he just fight Styke? After seeing what\nStyke did to the dragonman she couldn’t imagine a normal man living\nthrough a fight with him, though Styke had been hurting pretty badly when\nhe left. Whether or not it had been a fair fight, Fidelis Jes was still standing\n– and he had Styke’s knife and ring.\nHe looked pretty smug about it, too, so maybe he did kill Styke himself.\n“I’m moving the timeline up,” Jes said suddenly. “Things have changed,\nand we need Mama Palo apprehended immediately.”\n“Excuse me?” Vlora didn’t bother to hide her shock. “I have six more\nweeks.”\n“Not anymore.”\n“I’ve put plans in motion to take care of this peacefully.”\n“I don’t care,” Jes responded. “Bring in Mama Palo. You have three\ndays.”\n“That leaves me no other option than to march in there with an army to\ntry to find her. It’ll be a bloodbath.”"

Your\nillusions of solving this with a little community outreach may be laudable,\nbut don’t pretend to be something you aren’t.”\nVlora stiffened. “I’d like to speak with the Lady Chancellor.”\n“The Lady Chancellor has more important things to do than waste time\nwith a mercenary commander. Your men will receive a bonus for the change\nin the timeline, but you’re expected to ulfil your contract.”\nVlora felt like she’d been slapped. Anger churned inside her, threatening\nagain and again to come out in words she would doubtless regret more than\nwhat she’d already said. Jes thought he was putting her in her place, but he\nwas only pissing her off. The problem was she could do little about it. If it\nwere just herself she would call him out and cut him down. But she had\nresponsibilities – she had men to keep safe. He was right – this was not\nAdro, and she was not among friends.\nBut marching into Greenfire Depths was not going to do her men any\nfavors.\nShe pushed down her anger, trying to think clearly. Why was he moving\nup the timeline? Did it have something to do with the Dynize in Greenfire\nDepths? Jes was peeved, maybe even shaken. Perhaps from his fight with\nStyke – if that’s indeed what happened – or perhaps from something else.\nWhat wasn’t he telling her?\n“I’ll see it done,” Vlora finally said, wrestling the words out.\n“Very good.” Jes pointedly moved a file into the center of his desk,\nlooking down at it in obvious dismissal. Vlora hesitated a moment, and then\nleft.\nHer honor guard – an insistence by Olem, who trusted the Blackhats\nalmost as little as he trusted the Palo – stood just outside the Millinery.\nThey had been joined by one of her men on horseback. The soldier tipped\nhis cap. “Ma’am, message from Colonel Olem.”\nVlora pulled herself into her saddle, sighing. “It’s not good news, is it?”\n“There’s been another attack.”\nShit. “Where?”\n“Just inside Greenfire Depths. Meln-Dun was on a survey mission with\na whole platoon.”\nVlora tugged on the reins, turning her horse around toward Loel’s Fort\nand urging it into a canter. Pit and damnation, Meln-Dun was the key to her\nentire strategy in the Depths. Even if her hand was forced to violence, she\nneeded some kind of ally there.\nThe messenger kept pace. “We’ve thirteen casualties, but the platoon\nmanaged to pull out.”\n“And Meln-Dun?”\n“Barely escaped with his life. One of our boys took a bullet for him.”\nVlora bent over her saddle and urged her horse on harder, yelling for\ntraffic to get out of her way.\nVlora swept through a report of the violence – an ambush by Palo\ninsurgents in a narrow street in Greenfire Depths – and rushed into the fort\nadministration office, where a shell-shocked Meln-Dun was having a gash\non his face stitched up by a Riflejack medic."

Finally he seemed to snap out of it,\nwaving off the medic and meeting Vlora’s gaze. He licked his lips, clearing\nhis throat, but couldn’t seem to be able to find anything to say. Vlora had\nseen this kind of thing before among green recruits or ordinary citizens\ncaught in unexpected violence. Ambushes were terrifying no matter how\nexperienced you were, and one in such a claustrophobic place like the\nDepths would be doubly so.\n“It’s all right,” Vlora said, putting a hand on Meln-Dun’s shoulder. “I\nalready got the report. I know what happened.”\n“They attacked me,” Meln-Dun responded, eyes wide. “I’m trying to\nhelp them. I’m one of them!”\n“They attacked my soldiers,” Vlora assured him.\n“But I was there.” Meln-Dun touched his chest. “I was standing right\nthere in the open where they could easily see me. My own people were\ndown there with us. They killed Seren-Tel and Eleuia.”\n“His surveyor and an assistant,” the medic explained quietly.\n“I’ve been working with Seren-Tel for twenty years. He’s been a\nforeman at my quarry. I was going to…” Meln-Dun choked up, unable to\nspeak any further.\nVlora exchanged a glance with the medic, who no doubt would like his\npatient left alone to collect himself. But Vlora didn’t have time to leave\nMeln-Dun to grieve. Pushing him would be a risk, but Fidelis Jes had given\nher an ultimatum and Vlora saw a way to get what she wanted without\nmarching her whole army into the Depths.\n“Who do you think did this?” she asked gently.\nMeln-Dun averted his eyes, like a child who doesn’t want to tattle on a\nfriend. Finally he said, “I believe it was Mama Palo’s men. No, I know it\nwas Mama Palo’s men. I recognized one of her enforcers among the\nattackers.”\n“And you’re sure they saw you in the crossfire?”\n“I’m sure.” Meln-Dun shifted and allowed the medic to finish the\nstitches. “Lady Flint, I don’t think I should keep this from you.”\n“What?”\n“I believe they were coming for me.”\n“Why would you say that?”\nMeln-Dun waited until the medic had finished the stitches and Vlora\nhad dismissed him. Once they were alone the Palo businessman seemed to\ngather his wits a little better, soaking the fresh stitches with a washcloth and\ncleaning the blood from his face. Vlora watched him the whole time,\nsilently urging him to spit it out. She needed him to talk. This could be her\nopportunity to turn him against Mama Palo.\n“I made a discovery this morning,” he finally admitted. “Mama Palo is\nworking with the Dynize.”\nVlora circled around Meln-Dun and took a seat behind her desk.

She\nleaned back in her chair, absorbing the information. Part of her wanted to be\nsurprised, but it was the final piece of a puzzle that she didn’t even know\nexisted. Of course Mama Palo was working with the Dynize. They’d\ninfiltrated the Depths, and Mama Palo ruled the Depths. If even the\nBlackhats knew about them then she must as well. It made complete sense\nthat she was in cahoots with them.\n“To what end?” Vlora asked, not caring if it revealed her previous\nknowledge of the Dynize.\nMeln-Dun didn’t seem to notice. “I’m not entirely sure. Some of us\nhave suspected it for months, but I wasn’t certain until this morning. I was\nat the Yellow Hall paying my respects when I took a wrong turn – the hall\ncan be confusing even for those familiar with it – and entered a room with\ndozens of foreigners.”\n“You’re sure they were Dynize?”\n“Positive. Dynize and Palo may look the same to you Kressians, but to\nus the difference is as night and day. They didn’t seem at all happy to be\nfound, and I hurried from the place in fear of my life. I returned home, then\ncame immediately here. I thought the safest place to be would be among\nyour soldiers. At least until I could get word from my people whether I was\nin trouble with Mama Palo.”\nVlora drummed her fingers on her desk, trying to decide what to do. Did\nshe risk pushing him? “How can you be sure they came for you?”\n“It would just be another reason,” Meln-Dun said. “My deal with you…\nWell, to be honest, I haven’t been entirely forthright. I told you Mama Palo\nknew about it, but I didn’t say she disapproved. Her anger over my\ndefiance, and my discovery of her Dynize allies… that ambush was meant\nfor me.”\nSo Meln-Dun had lied to her. The fact that he had been willing to work\nwith her against Mama Palo’s wishes had to be a good thing, didn’t it?\nVlora opened her mouth, then closed it again, rethinking her strategy. If she\nsuggested an all-out coup against Mama Palo he might refuse. Some people\ncould be mad about loyalty. But if he suggested it…\n“I can offer you my protection while you’re here at the fort,” she said.\n“But beyond that I’m afraid there’s little I can do. My soldiers are here to\nkeep the peace and help with construction efforts, not interfere in the\npolitics of the Depths.”\n“I appreciate it, but I – ” Meln-Dun was cut off by a knock on the door.\nVlora was surprised to find a Palo on the other side. “One of my assistants,”\nMeln-Dun explained. “May we have the room for the moment?”\nVlora waited outside for almost five minutes, pacing the fort office and\ndrumming her fingers on the wall.

She needed to either prepare her soldiers for an all-out invasion of\nGreenfire Depths, or figure out a way to get Meln-Dun’s help in a coup\nagainst Mama Palo.\nA sob broke her concentration. She crossed to her office door and\nlistened for a moment, only for the door to open in her face. The messenger\nwithdrew, leaving Meln-Dun looking pale and shaken. “I’ve just heard\nword from my quarry,” he explained in a monotone.\n“Yes?” Vlora urged gently.\n“Mama Palo’s men have seized my assets in the Depths. My quarry, my\nhome, my family. You remember my business partner, Enna? She was found\nmurdered in her home not a half-dozen blocks from here. To be so brazen!”\nMeln-Dun’s expression hardened. “This has gone too far. Mama Palo must\nbe stopped. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know which is worse – that I\nmust flee my own people, or the prospect of going to the Blackhats for\nhelp.”\nThis was exactly what Vlora had been waiting for. She leaned over\nMeln-Dun, trying not to appear too eager. “You know the Yellow Hall\nwell?”\n“Of course.”\n“Mama Palo’s own chambers?”\n“I do.”\n“Then,” Vlora said, going to the door to summon a messenger, “I think\nwe can help each other.”\nCHAPTER 37\nM\nichel reached deep into the depths of his memory to find the tiny\nmarble he’d stored there so many years ago. He handled it delicately,\ncracking it open like an egg and letting all of the thoughts, hopes,\nambitions, and memories flood out into his mind. The outpouring of\nemotion was so sudden that, even though he knew it was coming, he\nlowered his head and began to weep.\nIt took him over an hour to regain control. He struggled to reconcile two\ndifferent personalities with two very different sets of goals until, finally,\nthey were one again and he remembered who he really was: Michel Bravis,\na Son of the Red Hand and to his knowledge the only Palo to ever infiltrate\nthe Blackhats to the rank of Silver Rose.\nTaniel stood silently through the entire process, watching him curiously,\na slight frown on his face. Michel used Taniel’s face as a lifeline to his old\nself – the one he’d been before he joined the Blackhats – staring back into\nthose cold blue eyes while his breathing normalized and his hands stopped\nshaking.\nMichel dried the tears from his eyes and within moments found himself\nlaughing. It began as a chuckle, bubbling up unbidden and escaping through\nhis clenched teeth, and was soon a wholehearted guffaw. He slapped his\nknees, bending over to try to catch his breath.\n“What’s so funny?” Taniel asked.\nMichel, once again, regained control. “It’s just I’ve barely slept in over\na week trying to find the person who printed Sins of Empire, and after\nchasing him through the bloody streets I come to find out it’s the very man I\nwork for.”\nTaniel gave a sardonic smirk. “You almost caught me down in the"

I would have felt a lot better about things if I’d known it\nwas you on my tail.” His face finally cracked into a smile and he seemed to\nrelax, sitting down across from Michel and reaching for the skin of tea.\n“If I’d caught you, it might have compromised my cover.”\nTaniel made a noncommittal sound. “Perhaps. Perhaps not.”\nMichel considered all the close calls and lucky breaks over the last two\nweeks, and then tried to think of them from Taniel’s perspective. The whole\nthing had been a game of cat-and-mouse, only for them both to find out that\nthere’d never actually been a mouse to begin with. It was a little\nhumiliating, if he was being honest with himself, but he decided that if no\none found out he could live with it in private.\n“The face thing,” he asked. “Sorcery?”\nTaniel nodded.\n“I didn’t know that was possible. Can’t other Privileged detect that kind\nof thing?”\n“It’s…” Taniel paused. “Very well done. Sorcery woven to cover\nsorcery. Not even another powder mage can detect me. Unfortunately, it’s\ngoing to take a long time to reapply now that I’ve let it drop.”\nMichel winced. “Sorry.”\n“You had no way of knowing,” Taniel reassured him. “Besides, I\nthought it important for you to see my face.” He suddenly leaned forward,\npeering into Michel’s eyes. Michel tapped his foot with nervous energy. He\ndidn’t know everything about Taniel – there were a lot of rumors in the\nnewspapers back during and after the Adran-Kez War, including the\nsuggestion that he’d killed a god – but he did know that, at the very least, he\nwas a powder mage not to be trifled with. “You do,” Taniel asked,\n“remember your mission?”\nMichel considered Taniel a friend, but no more than he might consider a\nfriendly cave lion a pet. He nodded slowly. “Infiltrate the Blackhats. Gain\ntheir trust. Climb the ranks. Be indispensable.”\n“And?” Taniel asked.\n“And wait,” Michel said.\nTaniel gave a satisfied smile. “Very good.”\nThe waiting, Michel had decided, was the hardest part of being a spy.\nThat’s why he created the marble; that’s why he stored the real him in a tiny\ncorner of his mind and locked it away. If he could become someone else\nentirely, then the waiting no longer existed and he could carry on happily,\nuntethered, until the moment it was time to change sides.\nBecoming an actual spy for the Blackhats – a double agent working as a\ndouble agent – had been supremely difficult because he could not become\nsomeone else entirely. He was still Michel Bravis with a history and a\nfamily and friends and a heritage. He wanted nothing more than to make his\nmother proud of her Palo boy, working for a Palo cause, but instead he’d\nhad to hurt her deeply by becoming the very thing she hated most – a\nmember of the secret police.\nLucky for him, he was very good at compartmentalizing his emotions."

If I don’t actually know my final goal, then I won’t\nbe able to spill it if my cover is blown and I’m tortured. “I know,” Michel\nsaid, taking a deep breath. “But sometimes…”\n“You want to know that it’s worth the trouble?”\nMichel nodded.\n“I won’t fill your head with false promises,” Taniel said.\n“You’ve never claimed to.”\nTaniel reached over and placed his hand on the back of Michel’s neck,\ngrasping him in a brotherly embrace. He peered deep into his eyes, as if\nlooking for something. There was a long, uncomfortable silence before\nTaniel pulled back, a thoughtful scowl on his face. “You’re a Silver Rose\nnow?”\nMichel showed him the Silver Rose looped around his neck.\n“Do you think you have a shot at becoming a Gold Rose?”\n“I do,” Michel said, then corrected himself. “Well, I did. Fidelis Jes is\nfurious about the Iron Roses you stole. He promised to make me a Gold\nRose if I brought you in.”\n“And if you fail to bring me in?”\n“I’ll be demoted.” Michel didn’t have to mention that a demotion would\ndestroy years of hard work. The very thought made him anxious, tightening\nsomething deep in the pit of his stomach.\nTaniel nodded, his thoughts seemingly far away. “We need you in the\nBlackhats more than ever right now.”\nMichel raised his eyebrows. He wondered briefly if Taniel was\ndedicated enough to the cause to hand himself over, but rejected the idea.\nTaniel was the Red Hand. Without him, the change that they wished to\nenact would never come about. “I might be able to string Fidelis Jes along\nfor a couple more weeks. But he’s already impatient, and something has\nhim on edge. I can’t guarantee that he won’t pull me from the mission any\nday now.”\n“Do Silver Roses have access to Blackhat records?” Taniel asked.\nHe obviously had something in mind, but Michel needed to be careful in\nhis questioning. If Taniel revealed too much, their whole effort could be at\nrisk. “Some of them.”\n“Anything regarding sorcery?”\n“No,” Michel said. “Absolutely not. I know they exist – the Blackhats\nkeep information on all the Knacked, powder mages, and Privileged in\nFatrasta and the Nine. But that kind of information is only privy to the Gold\nRoses, Fidelis Jes, the Lady Chancellor, and Lindet’s private cabal.”\n“Right,” Taniel said, chewing his words like he had something sour in\nhis mouth. “But a Gold Rose could find out about sorcerous artifacts?”\n“I… think so?”\nTaniel sat back, drumming his gloved fingers on the head of his cane.\n“I’m not sure if think so is good enough.”\n“If it’s not…”\n“It’ll have to be,” Taniel suddenly said, shooting to his feet and pacing"

    "text": "“I’m not sure if think so is good enough.”\n“If it’s not…”\n“It’ll have to be,” Taniel suddenly said, shooting to his feet and pacing\nthe length of the room. “We need information, Michel. We think the Lady\nChancellor is looking for something called the godstones, and we need to\nknow how close she is to them.”\nMichel sat up straight. His assignment had always been so vague; this\nwas the first time he’d been given any indication of a clear goal. It was\nelectrifying. And frightening. “I can’t find out that information as a Silver\nRose.”\n“Then we’ll have to get you your Gold,” Taniel said, consulting a\npocket watch. “Be back here in eighteen hours. Bring lots of friends.”\nMichel got to his feet, feeling slightly dizzy at the sudden changes to his\nmission. This was happening. “What am I going to find?”\n“You,” Taniel said, heading toward the door, “are going to find exactly\nwhat Fidelis Jes wants.”\nCHAPTER 38\nW\nhy am I still alive?\nIt was the foremost question in Styke’s mind as he was pulled roughly\nfrom the back of the Blackhat paddy wagon and carried through the\ndarkness. A dozen hands held him by the shoulders and legs, carrying him\nlike a corpse, letting him swing and bump around every corner, his ass\nhitting every rock they crossed. The stink of the marshes filled his nostrils\nlike the recurrence of a bad dream, and he knew from the creak of the gate,\nthe cold breeze, and that horrid stench that he was back in the labor camp\nwhere he’d spent the last ten years of his life.\nIt wasn’t supposed to happen this way. Jes was supposed to die,\nsquealing like a pig, and Styke soon after him. What had gone wrong? Was\nStyke overconfident? Was he too wounded and worn out from his fight with\nthe dragonman? Was he too crippled and old? Or was Fidelis Jes just that\ngood?\nLikely he’d never know.\nHis carriers constantly dropped him, their hands slipping on the slick\nblood that coated his body. Each scrape or jolt sent another lance of pain\nthrough his body. His once-good hand had gone completely numb, and the\nstab wound in his leg and shoulder both screamed out. He bit down on his\ntongue until he couldn’t feel that, either, and wondered whether he’d bitten\nclear through it.\nWhat did it matter if he did?\nHe kept his eyes closed – it was pitch-black but for the occasional\nlantern, so there wasn’t much to see anyway – but he heard doors open and\nclose, felt himself change directions a number of times, and when they\nfinally came to a stop he guessed he was in the labor camp infirmary.\n“On the count of three,” a male voice said over his shoulder. “One, two,\nhup!”\nStyke was half-lifted, half-thrown on a cold marble slab. He inhaled\nsharply, using all his focus not to scream. By the pit, this hurt. No, he\ndecided, this had gone beyond hurt. He was cut up, humiliated, and his\nwrist… he’d never hold a knife again. He might not even hold a cup again."

He might not even hold a cup again.\n“He’s all yours,” the voice said. “You, stitch him up. And the rest of you\n– the grand master wants him to heal for a few months, then you can do\nanything you want to him, short of killing him.”\nStyke heard the shuffle of feet leaving the room and finally opened his\neyes. He found himself the focus of four guards and the camp doctor, a\nsquirrelly little man by the name of Set. The infirmary had been cleared of\npatients and Styke was lying on one of the morgue slabs in the far corner.\nThe others gathered around him in a semicircle, and when he blinked\none said, “Son of a bitch, he’s still awake.”\nStyke let his head fall to one side and identified the speaker as Vladiar, a\nRosvelean with a high-pitched voice and a neck as thick as a melon. He was\nthe one whose cousin Styke had attacked after the parole hearing a few\nweeks ago. In fact, Styke recognized all four of the guards. They were\nJeffron, Landral, and Zach, the most infamous guards in Sweetwallow.\n“I can’t believe he’s still alive,” Landral said. He had a wonky lip, and\ndrool tended to slip out the side when he talked. He wiped away a rope of it\nwith his sleeve.\n“All that blood on him his?” Zach asked.\nVladiar grunted. “That’s what the Bronze Rose said.”\n“Nobody bleeds that much and lives through it.” That was put forward\nby Set, the doctor. Styke focused his eyes on the needle and thread clutched\nin one of Set’s hands and the way they trembled. Set hadn’t been a good\ndoctor before he got the palsy. “Don’t know how they expect us to keep him\nalive.”\n“Us? You, more like,” Vladiar said. “We’re just here to make sure he\ndoesn’t tear you in half.”\nSet paced from one side of the infirmary to the other, needle held in\nthumb and forefinger, the other hand on his chin. “Have you seen him? He’s\nnot going anywhere. The tendon is slit on that wrist – he’ll never use it\nagain – and that knife wound on his leg looks deep. Probably won’t walk,\neither.” He approached Styke and bent down to look him in the eye. Styke\nstared back, impassive, all his efforts going to keep himself from\nwhimpering.\n“We best get some straps,” Set said. “Landral, fetch some of that rope\nthey use for the sledges.”\nLandral scoffed, but headed out of the room.\nVladiar pushed Set out of the way and hunkered down at eye level with\nStyke. “You in there, big man?” He waved his hand over Styke’s eyes.\n“Yeah, you’re there. Kresimir, you’re hard to kill. You remember what I\ntold you a few weeks ago? I told you that you’re nothing but a killer. Looks\nlike you weren’t even good enough at that, if what the rumors say are true.”"

Looks\nlike you weren’t even good enough at that, if what the rumors say are true.”\nHe harrumphed. “I must be a prophet, boys, because I told him he’d be back\nand look at that: He’s back.”\nStyke closed his eyes. He knew the pain hadn’t even begun. He’d take\nmonths to recover, and once he did the guards would make him wish he\nhadn’t. It would be an endless cycle of beatings and hatred until the end of\nhis days and he didn’t even have one good hand left to fight back with.\nThe labor camp had never truly broken him, but this… this might.\n“What happened to that kid you took out with you?” Vladiar asked.\nStyke’s eyes shot open. Vladiar was right there, close enough Styke\ncould smell the cabbage on his breath. There was a shallow smile on\nVladiar’s lips, and he tapped the side of Styke’s head. “I remember her. And\nI remember how you broke my cousin’s leg. I’m gonna find that girl. I’ll\nbring her back here, and I’ll hand her over to the boys while you sit there\nand watch. I’ll cut the tendons on the back of your legs and laugh when you\ntry to crawl over to help her.”\nStyke bit his tongue again, suppressing the pain. He took a few breaths\nand felt every little cut react to the movement of his chest. He was tapped\nout. He had nothing left. “Good luck,” he whispered.\n“What the pit is that supposed to mean?”\nStyke flopped his arm backward, nearly passing out from the pain of the\nstab wound in his shoulder. His hand might be useless, but he could still\nmove, and he managed to wrap a forearm around Vladiar’s neck and jerk\nhim downward against the marble slab. There was a crunch, and Vladiar\ngave a whimpering cry and he collapsed.\n“Holy shit!”\n“Grab him.”\nThe two remaining guards leapt into action, Zach going to Vladiar’s\nside and Jeffron hammering a fist down into the wound on Styke’s thigh.\nStyke gasped and rolled toward Jeffron, coming off the slab with more\nmomentum than he’d expected. Jeffron caught him and almost kept his feet,\nbut Styke slammed his forehead between Jeffron’s eyes. The guard dropped\nlike a sack of potatoes.\nStyke slumped backward, the slab creaking on its frame. His breath\ncame short and painful, and he put all his weight on his elbow. He got his\nleg beneath him and managed to fling himself around the slab and onto\nZach, who was just getting up from his examination of Vladiar. The two\nwent down in a heap, and Styke ground his chin first into one eye, then the\nother, ignoring the battering Zach gave his chest. He managed to get Zach’s\nthroat between the working fingers of his bad hand and squeezed until the\nother’s cries were nothing more than a gurgle.\nIt took Styke several moments to gain his feet, but the knowledge that\nseconds were precious spurred him through the pain.

There was nothing left\nof him – he was just meat on the move – and the only thought that kept him\ngoing was that he would kill every last guard in this blasted place until there\nwasn’t anyone left to remember that he and Celine had left together.\nGroans escaped his lips as he dragged himself up. This corner of the\ninfirmary was a mess. Vladiar lay still, his head covered in blood, while\nJeffron gave the occasional twitch and Zach gurgled quietly. Across the\nroom, Set hid behind one of the infirmary cots. Styke swayed, caught\nhimself on the slab with his crippled hand, and nodded at the doctor. “Stay\nthere,” he ordered.\nGoing was slow. Styke left the infirmary at a snail’s pace, leaning\nagainst a wall when he could, putting the rest of his weight on the leg that\nhadn’t been stabbed when he couldn’t. He wondered, from time to time,\nwhat the pit he was doing. There was no escape from Sweetwallow. He\ncertainly wasn’t going to kill all the guards in his condition. They would\nfind him in minutes. But those thoughts were fleeting and inconsequential.\nHe was driven forward, leaving a trail of crimson behind him as he\nfollowed the long halls of the administration building past the guards’ mess\nhall and the parole cells until he came out a side door near one of the\nfences.\nWith nothing to lean against he only made it a few steps before he fell.\nHe caught himself on that crippled hand and lay still for several moments,\nlistening for an alarm. The night was silent, even peaceful with the sound of\ncrickets off in the marshes. Sweetwallow had a strict curfew, and the guards\nwould slack off from time to time to play cards in their bunkhouse. Maybe\nStyke had gotten lucky. Maybe he could escape.\nThe pain was so bad as to cause a delirium. He remembered a time he’d\nbeen unhorsed in the middle of battle, hitting his head badly when he fell.\nHe remembered the mud and the sound – the absolute chaos of the fight as\nhe tried to get back to his senses. Hooves and feet had hammered the\nground around him, and someone had bashed him from behind with the butt\nof a musket. His armor had taken the blow.\nHe couldn’t remember what had happened next, but he could hear those\nhoofbeats pounding in his brain as loudly as if he were back in battle.\nHe squinted through the memories and focused on the cracked wooden\nfencing that surrounded Sweetwallow. The labor camp palisade was twenty\nfeet tall and hardened in the sun. No breaking through and no going over\nthe top – not in his condition.\n“Ben, why did you leave me behind?”\nStyke looked over his shoulder. Celine was behind him – or at least a\nvision of her – standing in the administration building doorway, legs\nplanted to straddle the trail of blood he’d left. “I didn’t,” he managed. He\nforced himself up on his crippled hand, dragging himself toward the fence.\n“You left me behind, Ben.”\n“I didn’t,” he insisted again, still dragging. “I took you out of this place."

Ungrateful little shit.” Something twinged in his shoulder\nand he bit down hard on his tongue before dragging himself forward\nanother foot. “I didn’t mean it,” he muttered. “You’ve always been a good\nkid. I did leave you behind, but I left you with friends. Olem will take care\nof you. Send you to school. He’s not a bad sort.”\n“I don’t want to be with Olem. I want to be with you.”\nStyke reached the palisade and slapped his hand against the base. It was\nhard, firm. Might as well be iron. “Well,” he said to the ghostly apparition\nof Celine. “That’s too damn bad. I’m here forever, and you’re out there.”\n“I’ll get you out.”\nStyke raised his head, looking over his shoulder. The apparition was\ngone, but the voice he’d just heard sounded so real. He could feel tears in\nhis eyes, and wondered if this was what it was like to go mad. He heard a\nyell somewhere inside the camp, and smiled softly as the alarm went off\nalmost instantly. They’d find him any moment, and then…\nSomething warm touched his hand. It was so sudden and startling that\nhe jerked away, gasping at the pain of the sudden movement. He peered at\nthe base of the palisade, noticing a break in the thick wooden slats. Through\nthe murk he thought he could see a tiny face. He blinked, cursing his eyes,\nthen lowered his head to the cool dirt.\nBrains, he decided, could play cruel jokes on their owners.\n“Ben!”\nStyke’s head came up again. A tiny hand grasped his, tugging on his\nfingers.\n“Ben, wake up!”\n“Celine?”\n“You don’t look so good, Ben.”\nSon of a bitch. It wasn’t a fever playing tricks on him. “Celine, you have\nto get away from here. They’re searching the perimeter right now, and if\nyou don’t get out of here they’ll find you and they’ll —”\n“Don’t worry,” Celine said, patting Styke’s hand through the gap. “I\nbrought friends.”\nStyke let out something halfway between a gasp and a laugh. “I don’t\nhave any friends, Celine. Get out of here.”\n“You do,” Celine insisted. “And they’re not very happy.”\nStyke heard a shout, and then a sudden crash farther down the camp\npalisade. The shouts escalated, and then pistol shots rang out, punctuated by\nthe blast of blunderbusses and carbines. Celine was suddenly gone, and\nStyke reached forward weakly, grasping for her hand.\n“He’s down here!” he heard her shout. “On the other side of the fence!”\nStyke listened, confused, to the clash of steel and the cries of the\nwounded. It was over in moments, and then hooves thundered toward him."

It was over in moments, and then hooves thundered toward him.\nHe rolled onto his back, squinting at the hazy figures in the darkness. Who\nwould possibly come for him? Was it Tampo? Was it Lady Flint?\nFigures flung themselves off their horses and Styke felt himself lifted by\nstrong but gentle hands, his back pressed against the base of the camp\npalisade. Torches were thrust in his face.\n“Pit,” a man’s voice said, “he’s pale as a ghost.”\n“Lost too much blood,” another responded.\n“Pit, would you look at him? I hardly recognize him.”\n“The blood should make it easier,” someone else quipped.\nStyke couldn’t get his head around the voices – they were at once\nforeign and familiar, like a child’s lullaby from the distant corners of his\nmemory – and the sudden light of the torches blinded him. He tried to pull\nback as someone suddenly knelt in front of him and he could make out the\nunmistakable, runed gloves of a Privileged sorcerer.\nSomeone stood behind the sorcerer, silhouetted in the torchlight, pistol\npressed against the base of the sorcerer’s head.\n“You have no idea who you’re dealing with,” the Privileged hissed.\nBehind him, the silhouette responded in a husky female voice. “We’ve\nbeen over this. I don’t give a shit. Heal him, now. Any funny business and\nI’ll clear your sinuses with a bullet.”\n“Look at him,” the Privileged demanded. “This could take hours, and\nthe process might kill him.”\n“I’ve got all the time in the world,” the silhouette responded. “And you\nbetter hope it doesn’t.”\nStyke took a ragged breath. He recognized that voice. Like the others, it\nwas as if from a distant memory – but this one had haunted his dreams for\nten long years. He felt tears running down his cheeks, his hands trembling.\nHis eyes began to adjust to the torchlight, and he began to recognize faces\nstanding in a semicircle around him.\nLittle Gamble. Ferlisia. Sunin. Chraston. Jackal.\nIbana ja Fles.\nIbana half-turned to the others, the pistol aimed at the head of the\nPrivileged unwavering. “What the pit are you assholes waiting for? Set the\ninmates loose. Torch the admin buildings.”\n“The guards are held up in their bunkhouse,” Ferlisia said.\nIbana grabbed Ferlisia by the collar, pulling her close. “Do you see what\nthey’ve done to Ben? Our colonel? You set the guardhouse on fire, and\nshoot anyone who tries to escape. Shoot ’em in the legs and throw them\nback in. Pit-damned Blackhats have declared war on the Mad Lancers. They\nshould have known better.”\nStyke jumped at the gentle touch of gloved fingers and felt his arm\nlifted to the light of the torch by the Privileged. The Privileged examined\nhim clinically, then said quietly, “This is going to hurt. A lot.”\nThe last thing Styke remembered was a blinding white light.\nCHAPTER 39\n“T\nhis is it?” Meln-Dun asked."

    "text": "him clinically, then said quietly, “This is going to hurt. A lot.”\nThe last thing Styke remembered was a blinding white light.\nCHAPTER 39\n“T\nhis is it?” Meln-Dun asked.\nVlora cocked an eyebrow at him as he stood in the doorway of the small\npub back room she and a handful of chosen men had occupied on the rim of\nGreenfire Depths. There was some noise from the street outside, but for the\nmost part things were quiet, peaceful. The Palo looked nonplussed, and she\ncould see him counting the small group over and over again in his head\nuntil he finally turned to her with a pained expression. “This is not enough\nmen.”\nThere was a pregnant silence, only interrupted by the sound of Norrine\ndragging a whetstone across the blade of her sword. The scraping sound\nrepeated twice before Vlora pointed to the man on her left. He was twenty-\nthree and looked significantly younger with black hair and not a strand of\nbeard on his chin. He was dressed just like her in dark green travel clothes,\nbrown boots, high-collared shirt, and a slightly floppy tricorn that did well\nto hide his face. He carried a blunderbuss, nervously tapping the flared end\nagainst his boot.\n“This is Davd. He was a drummer boy during the Adran-Kez War.\nEleven years with the Riflejacks.” She thrust a thumb to the woman on her\nright. “This is Norrine. She’s been with the Adran Army for forty-two years.\nShe was trained by Field Marshal Tamas himself.” Norrine was an older\nwoman with dirty-blond hair and an elfin-like face. She was nearly to her\nsixties, but a tight physical regimen made her look fifteen years younger.\nShe continued to sharpen her sword, smirking at the fourth member of their\ngroup. Vlora introduced him. “Buden je Parst is Kez. Doesn’t speak a word\nof Adran so don’t bother. And Olem,” Vlora finished, slapping Olem on the\nknee, “you’ve met.”\nBuden grinned at Meln-Dun, revealed six missing teeth. He was missing\nmost of his tongue, too, but he preferred not to draw attention to that. Meln-\nDun’s pained expression deepened. “I understand your men are\nexperienced,” he said slowly, “but the Yellow Hall is guarded by the best\nthe Palo have to offer. If the Dynize are there as I fear, there may even be\ndragonmen. You should take no fewer than two companies.”\n“Two companies,” Vlora responded, “will just draw attention and slow\nus down. We’re not going in there for a fight. We’re there to smash in the\ndoor and bring in Mama Palo.”\n“Even still…”\nOlem snorted. “Don’t let her lead you on. This is the Riflejacks’ dirty\nsecret.

    "text": "once more. “I see. I had no idea the Riflejacks even had other powder\nmages.”\n“Hence the dirty little secret,” Vlora said. She took a deep breath, trying\nto get in the right frame of mind for a night raid. She hadn’t done anything\nlike this for years, and the prospect both thrilled and scared her. Five men\nagainst a whole warren of Palo thugs was dangerous, even if four of them\nwere powder mages. Mistakes could – would – be made. There would be\nsurprises. Everything they planned could go awry the moment they stepped\nout the door of this pub.\nTamas had always said that a greater risk had better come with a greater\nreward. She was risking the very heart of the Riflejacks, but the reward was\nthat she could accomplish the entire assignment in a single night – and she\nand her men walk away tomorrow with a full year’s pay. Mama Palo’s fall\nmight even bring long-term stability to Greenfire Depths. The money was\ngreat, but her conscience allowing her to sleep at night was even better.\n“Even with powder mages, I still don’t see…” Meln-Dun began, but\nNorrine held up a hand.\n“It’ll be enough,” she assured him.\nThe Palo finally entered the room and shut the door behind him, taking\na seat. He seemed remarkably calm despite the attempt on his life earlier\nthat day, and Vlora wondered if he’d been drinking to settle his nerves.\n“Are you sure you’re able to do this?” Vlora asked.\nMeln-Dun gave a confident nod. “I am. I have to. They’ve killed my\nfriends, taken my family and business hostage. If this does not happen\ntonight, I am finished.” He scowled, then looked up at Vlora. “Something\nhas been bothering me, Lady Flint.”\n“What’s that?” Vlora mentally checked her kit, counting her powder\ncharges, then making sure both her pistols were already loaded.\n“Mama Palo told me something when we spoke last: that a known\nBlackhat was seen leaving your headquarters on more than one occasion.”\nVlora exchanged a glance with Olem. “That is true,” she said. “I’ve\nmade no secret that we’re employed by the state. In fact, I believe that’s the\nreason you came to me in the first place.”\n“Yes, but this business with the rebuilding. Was it your main reason for\nbeing here?”\n“Keeping the peace has always been our reason for being here.” Vlora\nswore inwardly. Was Meln-Dun getting cold feet? Did he suddenly realize\nhow deep he was with the Palo’s long-standing enemy? Surely this mustn’t\nbe news to him. She reminded herself how easy it was to be self-delusional\nwhen you had a passion.\n“But,” Meln-Dun pressed, “your purpose here. Were you assigned to\nbring down Mama Palo by the Blackhats?”\nVlora exchanged another glance with Olem, wondering if this would be\na good time to lie. But, as she so often told her men, she hated a liar. “Yes.”\nMeln-Dun was silent for several long seconds, his tongue between his\nlips and his eyes on the floor. “All right. We can do this. I just wanted to\nknow where you stood.”"

I just wanted to\nknow where you stood.”\n“Same place I’ve always stood,” Vlora responded. “And I’ve never lied\nto you. I do have an interest in helping rebuild Greenfire Depths.”\nMeln-Dun looked away, unresponsive. Olem shrugged. Buden spat a\nwad of tobacco on the floor.\n“It’s well past time to get moving,” Norrine warned.\n“Agreed,” Vlora said, getting to her feet. She checked her men, using\nher mage senses to be sure they had enough powder and their weapons\nprimed. She took a spare pistol off the table behind Davd and held it out to\nMeln-Dun. “Have you fought before?”\n“It’s been many years,” he said hesitantly.\n“Take this just in case.” She turned to face the others and said,\n“Remember, we’re not here to conquer or fight or dilly-dally. We’re\ngrabbing Mama Palo and we’re getting the pit out as quickly as possible.\nKeep your knives and swords handy. Firearms are to be kept in check\nunless it’s absolutely necessary – if at all possible we want to be gone\nbefore they even know we’ve arrived. And only kill if we need to.”\n“There will be violence,” Meln-Dun said with a frown. “Killing can’t be\navoided.”\n“I’m making as few enemies as possible tonight.”\n“Every one of Mama Palo’s men you leave alive is another enemy on\nthe morrow.”\nOlem inclined his head toward Meln-Dun in a way that said he has a\npoint. Vlora shook her head at Meln-Dun. “We’ll keep it as bloodless as\npossible, but make no mistake. We’re all killers. This’ll go painfully if it\nneeds to. Let’s get moving before it gets any later.”\nDavd led them out through the back of the pub and down a side alley,\nchecking to be sure they weren’t spotted, before motioning for Meln-Dun to\ngo ahead. It was a quiet evening, a weeknight curfew in effect by order of\nLindet, and they were nearly alone on the dark streets of the plateau.\nMeln-Dun took a deep breath and stashed his pistol beneath his shirt\nbefore he led them along a series of winding streets. They crossed\nboulevards and back alleys running parallel to the Rim overlooking the\nDepths before finally taking a small, little-used path behind someone’s\nhouse down into a narrow hallway cut into the very rock of the plateau.\nThey descended rapidly into the cool stone passage, the steps becoming\nimpossibly steep, and only a quick pinch of powder snorted in each nostril\ngave Vlora enough night vision to see what she was doing. She heard the\nothers preparing themselves likewise. At the front, Meln-Dun seemed to\nnavigate confidently despite the pitch-black, and behind her Olem kept a\nhand on her belt, cursing from time to time as he stubbed a toe or bashed his\nelbow on the side of the quarry.\nTheir descent was arrested suddenly as Meln-Dun stopped to fiddle with\na door, and a moment later they were on flat ground once again."

They had\ncertainly not gone all the way to the bottom of Greenfire Depths, and as\nthey walked down what appeared to be plastered hallways, their footsteps\nechoed like they were tramping along the scaffolding of a tenement\nconstruction site and felt only slightly more stable.\nThis appeared to be some sort of highway, and despite the twists and\nturns the corridor remained wide with small shop windows along either side\nand the occasional Palo family sitting along the walls with a gas lamp,\ntaking a late meal or enjoying gossip with the neighbors. For the most part\nVlora’s small group was ignored, and when they reached the next junction\nshe asked Meln-Dun about it.\n“We’re in what we call the Cobweb right now,” he explained.\n“Suspended fifty feet above the floor of the Depths, some of these halls\nspan the entire length of the quarry. It’s much safer up here, but Kressians\nare never allowed.” He put an emphasis on “never” and Vlora lowered the\nbrim of her hat slightly, glancing over her shoulder.\nThey continued on for what felt like miles until Meln-Dun suddenly\nheld up a hand. They came to a stop behind him. The Cobweb was much\nmore active here, even more active than the streets up on the plateau, and\nthe group had begun to receive more than one curious glance. Things were\neven better lit here, too.\n“What’s going on?” Vlora asked, gesturing for Olem to drop back with\nNorrine to watch their rear.\nMeln-Dun pointed through an arched passage to a door a little farther\non. “We’re getting close to the Yellow Hall. Mama Palo’s men patrol this\narea heavily. We’re going to have to go down now, but we may encounter\nguards, starting just behind that door.”\nVlora gestured to Davd, tapped her eyes, and pointed at the door. The\nyoung powder mage crossed the hall quickly, slinging his blunderbuss over\nhis shoulder, and pressed gently on the door. Vlora counted to five, then\nfollowed.\nJust inside lay a Palo man in a pale green uniform, slumped on his side.\nDavd tapped the side of the man’s head. “He’ll live, but he’ll have a pit of a\nheadache when he wakes up.”\n“Let’s be in and gone before he does,” Vlora said.\nThey were joined by the others, and Meln-Dun frowned at the\nunconscious Palo. “Those are the uniforms Mama Palo’s personal guard\nwear. You shouldn’t leave them alive.”\n“Yeah, you said that,” Vlora responded, feeling a bit peeved. Meln-Dun\nwas a businessman, but in her experience the strangest people could get\novertaken by bloodlust when they had power over others. “There’s no\nreason to kill him. Let’s keep moving.”\nThey descended two more levels down a narrow staircase, then a ladder,\nbefore Meln-Dun stopped them again. “We’re here.”\n“Already?” Vlora asked.\n“That was quick,” Norrine commented."

Below the door was a ten-foot\ndrop to what appeared to be old clay shingles. She had a moment of\nconfusion before she finally chuckled. “We’re above the Yellow Hall. That’s\nthe original roof, isn’t it?”\n“It is,” Meln-Dun answered. “The Cobweb was built above and around\neverything that existed in Greenfire Depths before, with the exception of\nsome of the houses near the working quarries.”\n“Is that roof going to hold us?” Norrine asked.\nVlora glanced down into the darkness. “I hope so.”\nDavd went first, dropping down onto the clay shingles, scrabbling for\npurchase before getting a good footing. Vlora tossed down his weapons,\nthen her own, and lowered herself down from the trapdoor by her arms\nbefore letting go. Davd caught her, helping her get her footing, before\naiding the rest of the group down. Norrine came last, lowering the trapdoor\ngently onto her fingers before taking the drop.\nThey spread out across the roof, checking their weapons in the darkness\nbefore creeping along to the very edge of the shingles. Vlora could sense a\nsteep drop below her – probably three stories or more – and wondered how\nthey were going to get down. She and the other mages could make that\njump without suffering damage, but Olem and Meln-Dun would break a\nleg.\nMeln-Dun provided the answer a moment later, showing them to a small\nbelfry that rose above the roof. Vlora joined them just as a few sharp words\nbroke out.\n“You’ve been planning this,” Davd hissed.\nMeln-Dun recoiled. Vlora shushed Davd and turned to Meln-Dun, only\nto find the Palo was not denying the accusation. “What does he mean?” she\nasked him.\n“I mean,” Davd answered, “all of this. The roof, the trapdoor, this\nbelfry. He had to have planned this out well ahead of time.”\n“Don’t mind me,” Olem whispered. “Can’t see a damn thing because\nI’m not a bloody powder mage. I’ll just stand here in the dark until you’ve\ngot this sorted out.”\n“He’s been planning this,” Davd insisted.\nVlora glanced quizzically at Meln-Dun before remembering that he\ncouldn’t see in the dark, either. He was doing all this by feel. “Well?” she\nasked.\n“I…” There was an uncomfortably long pause, then Meln-Dun said in a\ndefeated tone, “I’ve considered the need to remove Mama Palo for several\nmonths. She’s been getting worse, more erratic, harder to negotiate with. I\nknew something would have to be done. I planned out this route several\nweeks ago, thinking I would be bringing Blackhats or Palo mercenaries in\nhere to assassinate Mama Palo.”\n“Assassinate” was a dangerous word for a businessman.

    "text": "weeks ago, thinking I would be bringing Blackhats or Palo mercenaries in\nhere to assassinate Mama Palo.”\n“Assassinate” was a dangerous word for a businessman. The idea\nbothered Vlora, but she thrust it aside. It turned out Meln-Dun was using\nthem just as much as she was using him, and somehow that made her feel a\nlittle less guilty. “It’s too late to quibble now. Get us through here.”\n“The belfry is boarded up from the inside. We’ll have to break through\nit.”\nDavd thumped on the boards. “That feels pretty tight.”\n“It’s going to make a pit of a lot of noise,” Olem warned.\nVlora vacillated for a moment. She might be able to drop down and find\nanother way in, then make her way back up to pry the boards off from the\ninside. But the Yellow Hall was an enormous house, and she could just as\neasily get herself lost and cornered. More important than staying silent was\nstaying together.\n“The belfry leads into the old master suite,” Meln-Dun said. “It’s where\nMama Palo lives and holds court.”\n“We’re above her court right now?” Vlora demanded.\n“Yes.”\n“Making a damned racket. They probably already know there’s\nsomeone up here.” Vlora reached out with her senses, trying to find\neveryone within a hundred yards with the slightest bit of powder on them.\nShe felt her other mages doing the same. Immediately below them there\nwere concentrations of powder that amounted to three armed men. A fourth\nand fifth were coming up the stairs to the second floor of the Yellow Hall\nand beyond that… well, she lost count at thirty.\nMama Palo had a lot of bodyguards.\n“Right,” Vlora said, readying her pistol. “Davd, knock it in.”\nDavd backed up and took a running start, throwing himself against the\nboarded window of the belfry. There was a mighty crash and he disappeared\nin a swirl of dust. Vlora followed him through, helping him to his feet,\nwhile Norrine, Olem, and Buden rushed down the stairs with weapons at\nthe ready. There was another crash as they forced a door below, and then a\ntorrent of shouting in Adran, Palo, and Kez.\nVlora leapt down the stairs, blinking as she entered a brightly lit room.\nThe walls were made of the same yellow limestone as the rest of the hall\nand decorated with candelabras and tapestries. The light came from lamps\nfed by haphazardly strung gas lines, and Vlora pulled up to find herself\nlooking down the barrels of three pistols as well as the blades of another\ntwo swords.\nThere were five men, not three, and she suspected they would be joined\nby many more within a few moments.\nThe five Palo guards wore pale green uniforms and looked angry and\nstartled, their faces red, fingers pulling triggers that wouldn’t respond.\nVlora could sense Norrine suppressing the powder in the pans, keeping the\npistols from firing.\n“Stop!” Vlora said, drawing her sword. “There’s no need for\nbloodshed.” She hoped to pit that they understood Adran, because her Palo\nwas terrible. “We’re here for Mama Palo. No one has to get hurt.”"

    "text": "bloodshed.” She hoped to pit that they understood Adran, because her Palo\nwas terrible. “We’re here for Mama Palo. No one has to get hurt.”\nBehind the five men Vlora spotted an old woman lounging on a divan in\nthe center of the room. She had a regal bearing, her chin held high, and she\nwore faded old buckskins and no jewelry like the Palo one might find deep\nin the Tristan Basin. She looked to be well into her seventies, hands shaking\nwith rheumatism, and Vlora had a sudden pang of guilt.\nThis was who was causing so much trouble? This was who Vlora had\ncome for? Could she bring herself to drag an old woman to the Blackhats\nand watch her hang?\nThe old woman seemed unafraid, even dismissive. “Kill them,” she said\nin Palo.\nThat Vlora understood. “Keep the noise down!” Vlora hissed,\nsidestepping a sword thrust and drawing the tip of her own smallsword\nacross a Palo’s throat.\nMama Palo’s bodyguards were good. Very good. Within moments Vlora\ncould tell that they were trained fighting men, and the fact they lasted\nlonger than half a breath against four powder mages was a miracle in and of\nitself. But they didn’t last long, and only Buden wound up with a slice along\nhis arm for their efforts and five dead or dying Palo soon lay on the floor.\n“Davd, get the door,” Vlora said, motioning toward the entrance. She\ncould hear feet pounding in the hallways outside, and Davd and Olem\nreached it in time to throw their weight against several people trying to\nshove their way in. “Buden, clean yourself up. Norrine, secure the old\nwoman. Wait, where…” Vlora’s question was choked off in midsentence as\nshe turned toward Mama Palo’s divan.\nMama Palo knelt beside it, speaking frantically in Palo, hands in the air.\nMeln-Dun held his pistol against her head, and he pulled the trigger before\nVlora could order him to stand down.\nVlora’s instincts were faster than her tongue, and the powder in the pan\nof the pistol sizzled briefly but did not take as she reached out with her\nsenses and suppressed the blast. She crossed the room in three strides and\nsnatched the pistol away from Meln-Dun, tossing it to Norrine. “No! I made\nit clear we’re taking her in.”\nShe was surprised to see real hate in Meln-Dun’s eyes. He sneered down\nat the old woman. “She deserves to die.”\n“Perhaps. But she’s going to hang – this will be state justice, not ours.”\n“And that makes it better?”\n“It has to,” Vlora spat, “or else we’re all just animals.”\n“The Blackhats will torture her. This is a kindness.”\nThe statement brought Vlora up short as she realized he was probably\nright. She’d just been asking herself if she could hand an old woman over to\nface the noose, and she’d decided in a flash that she could. She had, after\nall, lost good men to Mama Palo’s people. But to hand an old woman over\nto the Blackhat torturers? “I’m not here to do a kindness.” She put herself"

But to hand an old woman over\nto the Blackhat torturers? “I’m not here to do a kindness.” She put herself\nbetween Meln-Dun and Mama Palo and helped the old woman to her feet.\n“Do you speak Adran?” She repeated the question again for Kez. Mama\nPalo ignored her.\n“She speaks Adran and Kez just fine,” Meln-Dun spat.\n“You,” Vlora said to him, pointing to the other side of the room. “Over\nthere. And you, Mama Palo, are under arrest in the name of the Lady\nChancellor for crimes against the state.”\n“Is it a crime to want to be free?” the old woman said in perfect Adran.\n“In this country? Most definitely.” Vlora handed the old woman over to\nNorrine, then joined Davd and Olem by the door. There was a steady\nthumping on the other side, and the latch had already broken. The wood\nitself would give way at any moment. “Hold!” Vlora shouted. “We’ve got\nMama Palo. If you want her to see the dawn, you’ll let us out of here\npeacefully!”\nThe thumping stopped, until Mama suddenly shouted something in\nPalo. There was an answering yell, and then the thumping redoubled.\n“She told them to kill us no matter what happens to her,” Meln-Dun\nreported.\n“Norrine, keep her quiet!”\n“Perhaps,” Olem said, grunting as a particularly hard blow on the door\nalmost threw him on his ass, “you shouldn’t have told her we’re handing\nher over to the Blackhats.”\nDavd began swearing colorfully when a jagged bit of the door splintered\noff and buried itself in his shoulder. “Here,” Vlora said, taking his place.\n“Meln-Dun, what exactly was your plan to get out of here?”\n“My plan was to kill Mama Palo and show her head to her guards. To\ntake power.”\n“That actually works?” Davd asked.\n“That’s awfully tribal for a businessman,” Olem said.\n“Power is all they understand.” Meln-Dun’s voice was cold, angry, and\nfor a moment he seemed like an entirely different person.\nVlora had a pang of doubt, wondering if she’d backed the wrong horse,\nbefore casting it aside. Too late now. “I think you underestimate your own\npeople. You would have just gotten yourself killed very slowly.”\n“This door has seconds left,” Olem hissed.\n“All right. So much for not making any noise.” Vlora closed her eyes,\nfocusing on the powder that she sensed just outside the door. There were at\nleast seven people out there, and she found their powder and, with a\nthought, ignited it. She used her sorcery to warp the blasts, containing it,\nfocusing the explosions in small spaces to minimize the chance of starting a\nfire.\nThe blasts rattled the ceiling, causing plaster dust to sprinkle on their\nshoulders. The thumping stopped, and Olem immediately leapt away from\nthe door, jerking it open, his pistol at the ready.\nThere were a lot more than seven people in the hall. At least nine had\nbeen killed by the blast, and another eight milled around, mouths open,"

At least nine had\nbeen killed by the blast, and another eight milled around, mouths open,\nfingers in ears as they tried to get back their hearing. The closest drew his\nsword, but Olem put a bullet in his chest. Vlora shot a second, and then\nDavd forced his way between them and a roar of his blunderbuss put the\nrest of the hall on their backs.\nThe hallway was a bloody mess of mangled bodies and crying, moaning\nwounded. Vlora forced herself to ignore the carnage. “Quickly,” she said,\nleading her mages down the hall. She felt powder moving toward them and\nignited it, using the same technique to warp the blast inward. She felt her\nenergy ebb slightly with every effort, the sorcery bleeding away at her\nreserves in little jumps as she used it.\nThey cleared three more halls and made the ground floor, where Meln-\nDun examined the latest carnage with an edge of disgust. “I thought you\nsaid no killing.”\n“I said I didn’t want to kill,” Vlora snapped back. “Maybe if you had a\nbetter exit strategy we wouldn’t have to.” She swore, furious with both\nMeln-Dun for his half-wit plan and with herself for agreeing to it so\neagerly. She’d been too desperate to spare her men a fight.\nThree men with swords faced them in the main hall where Vlora had\nattended the party less than a week before. She took them alone, snorting\npowder for a fresh trance before carving through them as quickly as she was\nable, making it as painless as possible. These men, unlike the ones upstairs,\nwere clumsy and overenthusiastic. They never stood a chance.\nShe would have preferred to disable and move on, but her training was\nnot in that kind of combat.\nAs Ben Styke had told her, she was a killer.\nThey fought through another six guards before getting out of the Yellow\nHall. Meln-Dun led them down several side corridors before finding stairs\nto take them up, assuring them that the Cobweb gave them a far better\nchance of escape than being on the ground.\nVlora lagged behind, checking and rechecking her men with every step.\nBoth Davd and Buden were wounded, and Norrine practically had to carry\nMama Palo, but they were all present and accounted for. They reached the\nCobweb, where Olem dispatched a Palo in a pale green uniform, and then\nthey were running along the same corridor that had brought them to the\nYellow Hall.\nThey made it all the way to their exit unopposed, and Vlora almost\nshouted with joy when she saw starlight overhead and they came out on the\nRim. She looked back on the uneven lights of Greenfire Depths, her heart\nthumping hard.\nThey had made it. Six men in and six men out, and they had snatched\nMama Palo from the very heart of her power. The old woman threw herself\nto the ground, forcing Norrine to lift her like a sack of potatoes and toss her\nover a shoulder. The sight angered Vlora, and she found herself wishing the\nold woman would go with some dignity.\nIt would certainly be more convenient."

The sight angered Vlora, and she found herself wishing the\nold woman would go with some dignity.\nIt would certainly be more convenient.\nVlora didn’t know how many Palo they had slaughtered on the way out.\nAt least forty, she estimated. The poor bastards probably didn’t know what\nhit them, and she wondered if there was any way to keep her name out of\nthe entire affair.\nA powder mage in Greenfire Depths? They would have to know it was\nher.\nThe Blackhats were waiting outside the gates of Loel’s Fort. Vlora\nescorted Mama Palo into the back of the Blackhat prison wagon herself, and\nwatched as a silent pair of Iron Roses locked the door. There was a whole\ncompany on guard, almost as many as they’d brought for Ben Styke. She\nsearched their chests until she saw the dangling medallion of a Bronze\nRose.\n“Where’s Michel Bravis?” she asked. “He was supposed to be here.”\n“Agent Bravis is busy,” the Bronze Rose responded. “He’ll be pleased\nabout this, though. We’ve been working a long time to bring this bitch in.”\nVlora bit her tongue, then couldn’t help but ask, “What’s going to\nhappen to her?”\nThe Bronze Rose’s eyebrows went up. “An example, that’s what.”\n“Torture?” Olem asked, a dangerous note to his voice. He didn’t like the\nprospect any more than Vlora did. She reached out in the darkness to gently\ntouch his hand in warning.\n“Nah,” the Bronze Rose said with a note of regret. “She’s going to hang\nwithin days. The grand master doesn’t want any chance of a rescue attempt\nor riots. For the best, I suppose.”\n“For the best,” Vlora echoed, allowing herself a silent sigh of relief.\nThe Blackhats were gone within moments, and Vlora found herself\nwatching until the prison wagon was out of sight. She wondered about how\nquickly it had all gone. An hour ago Mama Palo had been challenging\nLindet herself for control of a significant part of Landfall, and now she was\njust another criminal ready for the noose.\nAll thanks to Vlora and her mages. It soured her stomach a little, and\nshe needed somewhere to spit, and a drink to get the bad taste out of her\nmouth.\n“Lady Flint.”\nVlora looked up to find Meln-Dun beside her. The anger and spite the\nPalo had shown during the kidnapping was gone, replaced with his normal\nplacid calm. She wondered whether she’d seen a truer side to him, or if the\nstress of the mission had brought out something dark. The latter was not\nunheard-of.\n“Well done,” she told him.\n“To you as well. I can’t thank you enough, Lady Flint. It may take a\nweek or two to calm things down in the Depths, but I’ll have my people\nbegin a purge of Mama Palo’s followers immediately. I think a time of\npeace and prosperity is due in Landfall.”\n“I certainly hope so,” Vlora answered. “And you’ll be able to get your\nfamily back safe?”\n“Yes, I believe so. I’ll see to that tonight.”\nVlora raised her eyebrows as Meln-Dun turned to leave. “Do you need"

With the chaos of Mama Palo’s\ndisappearance I should be able to rally my own forces without trouble.\nThank you again, Lady Flint. You have my gratitude.”\nThe Palo businessman left by the main gate, leaving Vlora alone in the\nmuster yard as her mages had gone to tend to their wounds.\nWell, not quite alone.\nOlem stood beside her, a weighing look in his eyes as he watched Meln-\nDun leave. He wore a small frown, and tapped an unlit cigarette against his\nlip. The night was suddenly quiet within the fort, muted sounds of a city at\nsleep drifting over the walls. It was so peaceful that Vlora wondered if the\nentire raid had been a dream.\n“This went off without a hitch,” she said quietly. “Why do I feel shitty?”\n“Having to kill a whole lot of people is a pretty large hitch,” Olem\nanswered. A match flared to life, and a moment later she smelled cigarette\nsmoke.\n“But I’m a bloody mercenary. I’ve killed hundreds of people. Maybe\nthousands. This shouldn’t bother me.”\n“You’re a killer,” Olem agreed, “but you’re a decent person.”\nThe two statements seemed mutually exclusive to her. “Do you think\nabout the people you’ve killed?”\n“Seems like a pretty good path to madness.”\nThere was a brief pause. “You didn’t answer the question.”\nOlem sighed. “Sometimes. I try not to.”\n“Same here.” Vlora looked out the gate, hoping that Mama Palo would\nmake it to the noose unmolested. She may have been the enemy, but she\nwas an old lady who had the guts to challenge the most powerful woman on\nthis continent. That was something Vlora had to respect.\nShe intertwined her fingers with Olem’s and said, “I’m sick of this\nplace. Let’s leave.”\n“I think,” Olem responded, “we should get paid first.”\nCHAPTER 40\nM\nichel returned to Landon Plain the next morning with three dozen Iron\nRoses, eight Bronze Roses, and two prison wagons. Taniel had told\nhim that he’d get his Gold Rose today, but he wasn’t entirely sure what to\nexpect. Which, he reasoned, would make things more authentic.\nHe spent the entire ride trying to put his thoughts and memories back\ninto the marble, but to no avail. He could feel himself slipping, mentally,\nthinking of the Iron Roses riding beside him in the wagon as his enemies\ninstead of underlings. He caught himself worrying about Taniel – no, he\ncorrected himself, Tampo – instead of champing at the bit to bring him in. It\nleft him confused and irritable, and it took all his effort to keep from\nmuttering about it under his breath.\nLandon Plain was bustling when they arrived, but the moment the\nprison wagons with the white roses emblazoned on their sides and their\naccompaniment of Blackhats rolled onto a street the Palo scattered like a\nflock of geese, leaving goods, animals, and even rickshaws where they lay."

    "text": "accompaniment of Blackhats rolled onto a street the Palo scattered like a\nflock of geese, leaving goods, animals, and even rickshaws where they lay.\nThe Palo Herald was quiet as the Blackhats surrounded it, and Michel\nfelt an anxious trepidation. What would he find inside? Bodies? Live Palo\nleft as scapegoats? An ambush?\n“All right,” Michel said, getting out of the back of the prison wagon and\npointing to two of the biggest Iron Roses he could find. “You two, take that\ndoor. You six, sweep under the docks. You four take the warehouse next\ndoor. Where’s Warsim?”\n“Here, sir,” Agent Warsim responded, getting out of the next wagon.\n“You take the lead.”\nMichel rounded to the far side of the prison wagon to watch the attack, a\ntrio of Bronze Roses remaining close in case of a fight. He licked his lips,\nthen nodded to Warsim as he and several big Iron Roses crept up beneath\nthe sign that said PALO HERALD. As one, they kicked in the door and\nrushed inside while the rest of the group sprang into action.\nWithin moments Michel heard the crash of more doors being kicked in,\nand coordinated shouting from the crawl space beneath the warehouse. He\nlistened to the tramp of feet, watching the open front door of the newspaper\noffice with bated breath.\nThere was a long silence, broken only by the crash of something being\nknocked over, and then a single shout.\nWarsim appeared in the doorway. “All clear!” he called.\nMichel let himself breathe, jogging over to the building. “What’s going\non?” he demanded. “Where is everyone?”\n“We’ve got nothing, sir,” Warsim reported. “It’s empty.” He scowled,\nand Michel waited for the bad news.\n“And… ?” Michel prompted.\n“There’s a body upstairs.”\nMichel rushed into the warehouse and took the stairs two at a time up to\nthe little room where, just yesterday, he’d spoken with Taniel. The room\nseemed dimmer than it had before, the walls closer together. And just\ninside, slumped beside a chair in the middle of the room, was a corpse lying\nfacedown in a congealed pool of blood.\nMichel slowly circled the body and waved away the buzzing flies. The\ncorpse wore an expensive suit, now soaked through with blood, with a cane\nlying on the ground beside it. Michel picked up the cane and, using it and\nthe toe of his boot, turned the body over. It held a spent pistol in one\noutstretched hand, and there was a bullet hole in the left temple. The wall\nbehind the body was covered in blood and bits of brain.\nThe face, despite being covered in blood, belonged unmistakably to\nGregious Tampo.\n“Do we have a Knacked?” Michel asked, trying not to wretch.\n“Sammlen, sir. He’s downstairs,” Warsim answered.\n“Bring him up here.”\nWarsim returned with Sammlen a moment later, and Michel pointed to\nthe body. “What is it you use to sense sorcery? Your third eye, right?”\n“That’s right, sir. It’s not easy, but I can do it.”\n“Tell me if there’s any sorcery here.”"

It’s not easy, but I can do it.”\n“Tell me if there’s any sorcery here.”\n“Sir?” the Knacked asked, looking confused.\n“Just look!”\nThe Knacked took a deep breath, closed his eyes, and then opened them\nhalfway with an intent gaze on the corpse. He held it there for almost\ntwenty seconds before shaking his head and blinking away a few tears. “No,\nsir. Can’t see any sign of sorcery.”\nMichel circled the body one more time. This was definitely not Taniel.\nIt definitely was Gregious Tampo. The height and weight looked right; the\nface was definitely his. Michel wanted to know exactly how this had been\ndone – was that some other poor fool there, or had Taniel killed himself to\ngive Michel an edge? It seemed impossibly unlikely. And besides,\nwondering wasn’t Michel’s job. His job was to get a Gold Rose.\n“Did we find anything else?” Michel asked.\n“No, sir.”\n“Do another sweep.”\nMichel let them search for almost an hour, tearing the printshop apart,\nbefore meeting Warsim outside next to a pile of everything of value they\nhad found. The pile consisted of eighteen crates of Sins of Empire, eleven\nmuskets, five pistols, ammunition, receipts from news distributors in\nLandfall, a whole library of antigovernment propaganda distributed by\nother revolutionaries throughout the last ten years, and a single handwritten\ndiary belonging, apparently, to Gregious Tampo.\nDown the street of the warehouse complex Michel spotted Palo faces in\nwindows and peering around corners, no doubt curious as to what was\ngoing on. He ignored them, flipping through the diary while his Blackhats\nwaited in silence. “I don’t know if a corpse is going to be enough to get me\nmy Gold Rose,” he whispered to himself.\n“Then you better have a damned good story to go along with it,” he\nanswered.\nHe read the last page of the diary and then flipped it shut, putting it in\nhis back pocket and looking up at Warsim and the assembled Blackhats.\n“Take all of this to the Millinery,” he said. “Inventory it and sell it.”\n“Even the pamphlets and propaganda?” Warsim asked.\nMichel wondered how long it had taken Taniel to create the persona of\nGregious Tampo – all the work that had gone into a false human being with\nan entire history. Tampo had written, published, and distributed a pamphlet\nthat had, despite all the work, accomplished very little. Michel was sure it\nwas not his only scheme, but it seemed like such a waste.\n“No,” he said. “Take the books and pamphlets outside the city and burn\nthem. Gregious Tampo is dead, and this whole affair with him. Bring me his\nold secretary and landlord from the office building to identify the body.”\n“Right, sir. Anything else?”\n“Yes. Let Fidelis Jes know I need to see him.”\n“You’ve brought me a body,” Fidelis Jes said, his tone flat.\nThe grand master was having lunch at his desk, a napkin tucked into his\npressed shirt, a bite of roast pheasant halfway to his mouth, orange sauce\ndripping onto the desk.

He noticed the drip, swore and finished the bite,\nthen wiped the desk with his napkin before tossing it on the half-finished\nmeal and pushing his plate to one side. Jes did not look well – his eyes were\nbloodshot, his hair unkempt, and his shirt wrinkled. Michel, in the times\nhe’d seen Jes around the Millinery, had never witnessed him so out of sorts.\nMichel cleared his throat. “Yes, sir. That’s right.”\n“What good is a corpse?” Fidelis Jes asked in a quiet voice. “What can I\ndo with a body? I can’t torture a body, can I? I can’t squeeze it for secrets!”\nHis voice rose in pitch until he finished by slamming a fist down on the\ndesk, making Michel jump. Michel noticed a ring on his thumb – a heavy,\nsilver ring with a lance through a skull. Had Jes worn that before today?\nMichel had not noticed, but Jes’s fidgeting drew attention to it.\nMichel grasped for something to say. “It’s definitely him, sir.”\n“Excuse me?”\n“I said…”\n“I heard what you said,” Jes snapped. “I want to know what you mean.\nHow is that supposed to reassure me? It’s definitely him. Bah! I’d rather it\nwas a double, so I could send someone more competent out to bring the\nbastard in.”\nMichel was careful to let nothing show in his face. Not his rising\ncertainty that Taniel was still out there, not his fear – and certainly not the\ndeep loathing he felt for Fidelis Jes and everything he stood for. “Sir,” he\nsaid in a reasonable tone, “that means it’s over.” He slipped the diary from\nhis pocket and set it on Jes’s desk. “With Tampo dead, it leaves no loose\nends. Remember how careful Tampo was about bank records and rental\nagreements and witnesses? Well, he didn’t have a perfect memory. He had\nto keep it straight somewhere, and it’s right there.”\nFidelis Jes looked at the diary with a vague air of disgust, as if Michel\nhad plopped a dead groundhog on his desk. “You mean we have his\norganization?”\n“Everything,” Michel emphasized. “There was no organization. There\nwas only Tampo. He masterminded the entire Sins of Empire affair, using\nhired help every step of the way, most of which didn’t even know his real\nname. He thought that he could overthrow the Lady Chancellor’s regime\nthrough a sort of bloodless coup – by turning the populace against her and\nforcing her to step down.”\n“That’s awfully shortsighted for someone so careful.”\n“Maybe. Maybe not. I checked with several of our propagandists and\nthey said the theory is sound. Tampo wasn’t going to stop with Sins of\nEmpire. He planned dozens more pamphlets over the next few years. It’s all\nin his diary. This was just the beginning, but we’ve managed to cut the head\noff the snake before it could multiply.”\nMichel leaned forward slightly as he spoke, putting excitement behind\nhis words that he didn’t feel.

The grand master had to be convinced that Tampo’s suicide\nwas not a fluke. Michel snatched up the diary, turning to the last few pages.\n“Look, sir. Tampo writes about the close calls he had with our Blackhats.\nWe were right behind him, dogging him every step for the last week. He\nkilled himself because he feared what we would do when we caught him. It\ndoesn’t matter that we don’t have him, because all he worked toward was\nfor naught.”\nJes leaned back in his chair. He didn’t look convinced, but he didn’t\nlook irate anymore, either. “I suppose you want to take credit for that, do\nyou?”\n“I was the one who dogged him.”\nJes’s eyes narrowed, and he watched Michel for a silence that stretched\nnerve-rackingly long before he got up, rounded the desk, and took the diary\nfrom Michel’s hands. He paced the room, flipping through the pages.\nMichel stood at attention the whole time, sweat trickling down the small of\nhis back while he waited for Jes to find some sort of mistake that would\ngive away the entire game.\nMichel had to admire Taniel’s foresight. The journal was impeccable. It\nhad been written in every week for almost three years, and illustrated the\ndownfall of a disenfranchised Adran nobleman who’d escaped Field\nMarshal Tamas’s coup in Adro ten years ago and come to Fatrasta, only to\nlose what remained of his family fortune on speculations. He had no friends\nor family to question, and this writing illustrated a paranoid mind that was\nconvinced he could remove Lindet from power and then step into a role in\nwhatever government rose from the ashes of hers.\nThe journal had not been written last night. It was a long, thoughtful\nwork. Likely something Taniel had been keeping as some sort of kill switch\nfor the whole persona of Tampo for the eventuality of being caught by the\nBlackhats.\nBut was it perfect?\nAlmost a half an hour passed before Fidelis Jes thoughtfully set the\ndiary on the corner of his desk, then crossed the room to a small chest\nsitting above the fireplace. He palmed something, then turned toward\nMichel. “I’m not pleased by the conclusion of this problem, Agent Bravis,”\nhe said coldly.\nMichel licked his lips.\n“However,” Jes said, “I am pleased that it’s over. We have far more\npressing items of concern going on right now. I consider your wrapping up\nof the Sins of Empire affair to have involved quite a lot of luck and blunder.\nBut there is a place in the Blackhats even for that, so I will not demote\nyou.”\nMichel suppressed a disappointed sigh. Not being stripped of his rank,\nhe tried to tell himself, might have been the best possible outcome here. But\nit wasn’t what he needed. It wasn’t what Taniel had killed off Gregious\nTampo for. He cleared his throat and mentally tossed the dice for a risky\ngamble.\n“Sir,” he said firmly, “I think I earned more than that.

Without proper\ninvestigative training I tracked down Tampo and I ended the danger he\npresented toward the Lady Chancellor. I believe I’ve earned my Gold\nRose.”\nFidelis Jes crossed the room so quickly Michel threw himself backward,\nreeling. The grand master caught him by the front of his shirt, yanking him\nclose, their noses almost touching. “You think you’ve earned the Gold\nRose, do you?” Jes hissed.\nMichel’s throat felt like a desert. “Yes,” he croaked.\n“Luck and blunder aren’t enough,” Jes said. “But loyalty? Loyalty,\nAgent Bravis, is a coin worth more than silver.” He grasped Michel’s\nshoulder, pressing something hard against Michel’s skin, before releasing\nhim and returning to his desk. Michel managed to catch the amulet before it\nfell, opening his fingers to reveal a Gold Rose. He let out a long, shaky\nsigh.\n“Thank you, sir.”\n“I am short-staffed right now,” Jes said. “But all my Gold Roses have a\nsingle objective. Benjamin Styke was captured last night and immediately\nescaped from Sweetwallow Labor Camp. The camp has been destroyed, and\nStyke is at large. You’re to bring him in.”\n“What about Lady Flint?” Michel asked.\n“What about her?”\n“I’m her liaison.”\n“Not anymore. She’s finished her current contract. If we give her a new\none, I’ll assign another Silver Rose. You’ve got work to do. Now get out of\nmy sight.”\nMichel closed the door to Jes’s office, leaving Michel in the\nantechamber with the secretary, Dellina. Dellina gave him a warm smile, as\nif he hadn’t just about had his heart handed to him by the head of the secret\npolice. “Congratulations,” she said.\n“Thanks,” Michel replied in a daze.\n“Go get a celebratory drink,” she suggested. “It’ll take the edge off.”\n“Good idea. First, I’m going to go change my pants.”\nCHAPTER 41\nV\nlora sat alone and watched the sun rise over the half-built foundations of\nthe tenement that, until just last night, her men had been preparing to\nerect on the rim of Greenfire Depths. A sleepless night contributed to her\nsense of deep melancholy, and she wondered if anyone would come along\nand finish these tenements after she was gone.\nIt was an encouraging thought. Perhaps Meln-Dun would see them\nfinished, or another Palo businessman. Maybe even the Blackhats. After all,\nthey’d already allocated the funds. But she didn’t know if it would happen,\nand she tried to tell herself she didn’t care.\nFeeling empathy for the Palo people was not new to her. She had tried\nto break their spirit on the frontier, but she had instructed her men to show\nmercy and compassion, and attempted to leave the survivors with the tools\nto better themselves. Her role out there had not been as a governor, but as a\nsuppressor, and she wondered now if she would have found something\nmore fulfilling out of the former.\nDespite that preexisting empathy, something about Greenfire Depths\nmade her feel more conflicted over the arrest of Mama Palo than she had"

She\ncouldn’t quite put her finger on why. Perhaps Vlora respected Mama Palo\nfor her defiance. Perhaps she felt remorse over arresting an old woman.\nShe pushed the musings aside and picked herself off the street, walking\nthrough the tenement foundation and then over two blocks to look out on\nGreenfire Depths. She had more pressing things to worry about than\nrebuilding a city slum that held no real significance to her or any of her\nmen. Far more important was how the Palo would react once they found out\ntheir leader had been taken by the Blackhats and sent to hang.\nVlora had tried to come up with a way to keep her name out of the story\n– she even considered making a personal request to Fidelis Jes – but she did\nnot need to owe Jes a favor. Besides, they’d left too many witnesses and too\nmuch evidence behind. Everyone knew that the Riflejacks had the only\npowder mage in town, and all she could hope now was that no one figured\nout that she had three other mages with her as well. That was a trump card\nshe preferred to hold on to.\nNo, the Palo would know exactly who had captured Mama Palo. Even if\nthere weren’t outright riots, the attacks against her men would escalate\nbeginning as soon as today, and she had to consider their safety. Meln-Dun\nmight be able to restore order. Or he might fail. Or he might use the\nRiflejacks as a point of unification to bring Mama Palo’s former men under\nhis control and turn all of Greenfire Depths against her. After last night, it\nwouldn’t surprise her one bit.\nVlora wondered if it was time to get out of this place. Perhaps even to\nreturn to Adro and mend some old wounds.\nShe walked back to the tenement only to find Olem waiting for her,\naccompanied by a familiar face: Fidelis Jes. Vlora offered the grand master\nher hand, which he shook perfunctorily. Jes did not look entirely well; in\nfact, a second look told her he was still wearing the same shirt as yesterday,\nhis hair mussed, his eyes bloodshot.\n“He said it was an emergency,” Olem said in a low voice, coming to her\nside.\n“I see. I didn’t know you left the Millinery, grand master,” Vlora said.\n“I do my best not to,” Jes replied. “Hold the pleasantries, this isn’t an\nhonor, Lady Flint. I’m simply here to let you know that the Lady\nChancellor is very pleased that you brought in Mama Palo so quickly. I\nmyself am suitably impressed. I didn’t think you could do it.”\nVlora allowed herself to be pleasantly surprised. “Well, then. Thank\nyou. I think.”\nIf Jes had meant the compliment to be backhanded, he didn’t show it.\nHe turned away from her and Olem, studying the tenement foundation,\nclearly distracted.\n“What will happen to Mama Palo?” Vlora asked."

I oversaw it myself. She’ll be hanged in the\npublic square outside the capitol building at noon tomorrow.”\n“I expected you to draw it out.”\n“I would have liked to. Mama Palo could have made an excellent\nexample. But publicly torturing an old woman wouldn’t have gained us\nmuch, and we’re not entirely monsters, despite what you may think.”\nCould have fooled me.\nJes continued: “Noon tomorrow is enough time for the rabble to gather.\nNot enough time for them to organize.”\nVlora watched him fidget with his sword for a moment and noticed that\nhe was wearing Ben Styke’s knife on his belt. Fidelis Jes had struck her\nfrom the beginning as a man who kept trophies. He had not, however,\nstruck her as a man who fidgeted.\nIt was Olem who voiced her next question. “This isn’t just a\ncongratulatory visit, is it?”\n“No,” Jes replied, his voice clipped. He clasped his hands behind his\nback, still looking away from her and Olem. “This is a matter of some\npersonal embarrassment, but Benjamin Styke has escaped.”\nVlora looked sidelong at Olem, who adopted a look that obviously said\ngood for him, and shook her head. He scrunched up his face and dug in his\npocket for his tobacco. “I assumed he was dead.”\n“He was not,” Jes replied. “For reasons unbeknownst to me, the Lady\nChancellor will not allow Styke to die. He was suitably chastised and\nreturned to the labor camp in which he’s been incarcerated for so many\nyears.”\n“I thought he escaped that camp before.”\n“It was more complicated than that. Regardless, we thought it was a\ngood place for him.”\nVlora snorted. “But it wasn’t.”\n“No,” Jes snapped, finally turning toward her. “The Sweetwallow Labor\nCamp was destroyed last night, the buildings burned to the ground, the\nguards slaughtered, and the convicts released.”\n“You don’t think that we did it, do you?” Vlora asked, incredulous.\n“No. We believe it was the work of Styke’s old comrades, the Mad\nLancers.”\nThe thought of a bunch of angry old veterans attacking a labor camp\nalmost made Vlora laugh. She bit her bottom lip, glancing at Olem.\n“Weren’t they disbanded ten years ago?” Olem said.\nJes ignored the question. “I want Styke recaptured, and I want his\naccomplices hunted down and executed.”\n“And you want us to do it?” Vlora asked flatly. Even before he’d\nfinished his sentence she began running numbers and logistics in her head,\ntrying to decide how much work it would be to capture or kill a company of\nretired veterans. The Mad Lancers were legendary, but they were ten years\npast their prime. She didn’t doubt her men could handle them.

But she\nwasn’t sure it was worth it.\n“Your assignment regarding Mama Palo is over and we have paid you in\na mix of bullion, bank notes, supplies, and letters of mark as requested.”\nVlora gave a low whistle. “Already?”\n“Yes,” Olem confirmed. It was by far the fastest they’d ever been paid.\n“I’ve even authorized a bonus, paid immediately, if you’re willing to\ntake on another assignment this very moment,” Jes continued.\n“Styke?”\n“Yes, Styke.”\nVlora continued to run through logistics, but suddenly put a stop to it.\nWhat was she doing? She hated Jes, didn’t much care for Lindet or her\ngovernment, and her men were about to have a significant population of the\ncity turn against them purely by default. Besides, she liked Styke. He’d\nmore than proved his mettle and she had no interest in chasing after him\nand putting him down like a mad dog.\nShe glanced at Olem. He’d managed to restore his card-playing face,\nbut she didn’t even need to ask his opinion on a matter like this. “Is this\ncoming straight from Lindet?”\n“From me,” Jes replied.\n“Not interested.”\n“I’ll have Lindet on board with the idea by this afternoon.”\n“Still not interested.”\nJes’s face reddened slightly. Whatever he was expecting, an outright\nrefusal was not it. “Is it because of your relationship with Styke?” He took a\nmeasured breath, then said, “We’re rather low on manpower at the moment.\nI can provide you with a different assignment that will free up my own men\nto address this menace. We could have you continue your garrison of Loel’s\nFort to keep the peace against the Palo.”\n“My relationship with Styke, as I mentioned before, was as a\nsympathetic employer to an old crippled veteran. And no, I’m not interested\nin having my men picked apart by angry Palo for the next year. You can’t\nfight what’s going on in Greenfire Depths. You have to either make changes\nbig enough to bring them around to your side, or burn the whole bloody\nplace down.”\n“You could garrison Fort Nied…”\nVlora raised a hand to cut him off. She was surprised that Jes seemed so\neager to keep her on the payroll. Her impression of him was that he didn’t\ncare one bit for her. “If I didn’t know any better, I would think you’re trying\nto keep me around.”\n“You’re… valuable.”\nSo are green-eyed vipers, but I don’t let them have the run of my\nluggage. “No thank you, grand master. I expect to give my men some leave,\nand then we’ll be departing Fatrasta entirely. Back to the Nine with us.”\nJes ground his teeth. “And no amount of money would sway you?”\n“Not any that comes to mind,” Vlora replied.\n“Well,” Jes said. He fumed openly, his jaw thrust toward her. “I’m sorry\nto hear that. You’ll understand that we don’t want an unauthorized army on\nour soil. You have two nights to remove yourself from Loel’s Fort and four\nto take your men out of the city. Good day, Lady Flint.”"

Good day, Lady Flint.”\nJes strode away, fists clenched, and Vlora turned to Olem the moment\nhe was out of earshot. “Did that seem strange to you?” she asked.\n“Very,” Olem said. “He is going to give himself an apoplexy.”\n“Over one man?”\n“Well,” Olem responded, “a whole company.”\n“It has to be something else,” Vlora responded, though she couldn’t for\nthe life of her decide what. He probably was worried about Palo riots, and\nhe did know about the Dynize, though they were hardly a threat contained\nas they were down in Greenfire Depths. “There’s no way he’s going that\nmad over the prospect of a single group of retired lancers running amok.”\n“The Mad Lancers were legendary,” Olem said. “They broke whole Kez\narmies back in their day.”\nVlora mulled that over. She’d witnessed legendary companies firsthand\n– some that lived up to their reputations, and more that did not. But even if\nevery story was true, Jes’s behavior didn’t make any sense. Something else\nwas on his mind. Something big. Styke was just the thorn that continued to\nprick him. “It’s not our problem anymore. Looks like we’ve overstayed our\nwelcome, both with the Palo and our former employer. Start chartering us\npassage back to the Nine.”\n“You were serious about that?” Olem asked.\nVlora hesitated. She had a lot of bad memories back home, some of\nwhich she’d been running from for more than five years. Perhaps it was\ntime to head back and take those on. Or perhaps not.\n“Check with the local chapter house of the Wings of Adom. See if they\nhave any work for us. We’ll head home for the winter, then re-form the\ncompany in spring. Maybe head to Gurla.”\nOlem touched the brim of his hat. “Right. Any specific action we’re\nlooking for?”\n“I’m sick of oppressing people,” Vlora said, glancing toward Greenfire\nDepths. “I’m sick of working for tin-pot dictators. Find me an underdog to\nfight for. As long as they can pay decently, of course.”\n“That’s the kicker.”\n“It always is.” Vlora took the cigarette out of Olem’s mouth and drew\non it deeply before handing it back. She had a feeling in her gut, a twisting\nof her bowels that made her want to look over her shoulder.

    "text": "he Privileged,” Styke asked. “Did you kill him?”\nHe sat in bed in a rented room above a pub in one of the dozens of\nborder towns that surrounded Landfall. It was the middle of the afternoon,\nand he could hear the hum of lunchtime conversation in the room below\nhim and the clatter of traffic in the street outside. Ibana ja Fles, manager of\nFles and Fles Fine Blades and second in command of the Mad Lancers\nheavy cavalry, sat on a chair beside the bed.\nFew people would consider Ibana a beautiful woman. She had a tough,\ncracked face from years of working the forge, with a broad forehead and\nflat, pockmarked cheeks. She had dirty-blond hair tucked carelessly into a\nponytail, with an easy smirk that brought back more than a few good\nmemories. She towered over most men, just a few inches shy of Styke’s\nheight, and was strong as an ox. She used to entertain the lancers by\ncracking empty powder barrels between her thighs.\nIbana popped her knuckles one at a time, first working through one\nhand and then the other. Styke had been awake for several minutes, and\nshe’d yet to say a word.\n“No,” she finally said. “I dumped him in a ditch on the other side of\ntown.”\n“You’re getting soft.”\n“I told him I’d let him go unharmed if he healed you. I keep my\npromises.”\nStyke looked down at his shoulder and traced a finger over a thin, pink\nscar – all that remained of the deep stab wound from Fidelis Jes’s knife. He\nhad seventeen other new scars of varying length over the rest of his body,\neach of them feeling tight and uncomfortable. He rotated his arm, surprised\nto feel only the slightest twinge. Everything felt as good as new – or at least\nas good as it was before his fight with Fidelis Jes. The Privileged had even\ntaken some time on each of the old bullet wounds, and Styke found that he\nnow had more, though not complete, use of his middle and index fingers on\nhis left hand. “Healing Privileged are damned rare. Where did you find him\non short notice?”\n“He’s one of Lindet’s personal cabal. I actually nabbed him to take care\nof the Old Man, but then Celine showed up ranting about you going to the\nMillinery.”\n“Celine?”\n“She’s safe,” Ibana said shortly.\n“And the Old Man? Is he… ?”\nIbana’s eyes narrowed. “He’ll live. No thanks to you. He’s pissed as a\npit about the house.”\n“I didn’t want to involve him.”\n“But you did.”\nStyke chewed on his words, then decided a nod would suffice. “I had\njust got out. I needed someone I could trust.”\n“So you brought my elderly father into your personal vendetta?”\nStyke scowled, confused. What was that supposed to mean? “No,” he\nfinally said. “It wasn’t about Fidelis Jes at all. At least, not from the start.”\n“I don’t believe you.”\n“Have I ever lied to you?”\n“On several occasions.”\n“About anything important?”\nIbana worked through her fingers again. Only one of them popped. “I\ndon’t want your excuses, Colonel.”"

    "text": "“Have I ever lied to you?”\n“On several occasions.”\n“About anything important?”\nIbana worked through her fingers again. Only one of them popped. “I\ndon’t want your excuses, Colonel.”\nStyke felt his stomach clench. Ibana only called him “colonel” when she\nwas worried, or furious. She didn’t look all that worried now. But he was\ndone. He was whole and safe – at least temporarily – for the first time since\nbefore the war and he wanted to enjoy it for a few minutes. “What do you\nwant, then?” he demanded.\n“I want an apology.”\n“For what? Getting the Old Man’s shop wrecked? Him beat up?\nBecause if you don’t think I’m bloody well sorry for that then you’re a\nfool.”\nIbana’s jaw clenched. “No,” she said quietly. “I expect you to apologize\nfor leaving me alone the last ten years.”\n“Fine,” Styke snapped. “I apologize. I apologize for making enemies\nwith that psychotic horse’s ass Fidelis Jes. For getting put in front of the\nfiring squad. For getting hauled off and buried in a labor camp and then for\ntrying to keep everyone else from getting my shit on them when I got out.”\n“I saw that camp. You could have escaped.”\n“I didn’t want to.”\n“Why not?”\n“Because I knew that this – your father, Little Gamble’s pub, Sunin’s\napothecary – all the things they’d built would come crashing down the\nmoment I escaped. I managed to get out without violence, and I was stupid\nto think that I was free. But I wasn’t.”\nIbana regarded him warily. “You knew about all that? Gamble’s pub?\nPeople’s homes and businesses?”\n“Not until after my fight with Jes,” Styke said, lowering his voice. “I\nwent to fight him because I thought it would prevent all that. I wanted to\nkeep him from hurting the rest of my friends. But he’d already done it, and\nhe used it to taunt me when I was down.” He let out a sigh, looking around\nthe room, wondering what he was going to do next. Five minutes ago he’d\nfelt like a new man, but the argument with Ibana had taken everything out\nof him. He felt drained and invalid, and when he tried to move his leg the\nold bullet wound reminded him that the Privileged hadn’t been able to heal\neverything. “I’m sorry I left you alone.”\nIbana stood up, stretching. “Here’s the thing,” she said, before suddenly\nsnapping one fist forward, slamming it across Styke’s face. Styke jerked\nback, knocking against the headboard, stars swirling before his eyes. He\ntasted blood and it took almost thirty seconds before he could see clearly.\nHe found Ibana gone, the door left open behind her.\nStyke rolled slowly out of bed, all the aches and twinges he thought\nhe’d left behind suddenly catching up to him. He’d only had healing sorcery\nto this extent once before, and his body had felt like a new, slightly too-\nsmall glove for over a week.

Ibana had pulled her punch.\nShe was getting soft.\nHe checked all the new, pink scars again. Most he didn’t remember\ngetting, but he could still feel the slice along his left wrist that had left him\nunable to move his fingers. A bead of sweat rolled down the back of his\nneck and he quickly buried the memory, flexing his hand to remind him that\nit was working once again.\nIbana was back. The knowledge was both frightening and comforting at\nthe same time. He’d always been the head of the Mad Lancers, she the\nbackbone; in some ways not unlike the relationship between Lady Flint and\nOlem – though he guessed Ibana had a cruel streak that would make Olem\nblanch. None of that mattered now, though, he reminded himself. The Mad\nLancers no longer existed. They were an idea, a memory – a shimmer on\nthe distant horizon.\nAnd his relationship with Ibana? He’d put her father in danger. He’d\ndisappeared for ten years. He didn’t know if she’d taken other lovers or pit,\ngotten married. He didn’t want to ask. And even if she hadn’t, ten years was\nan awfully large gap to cross.\n“Pit, you’re old,” her voice said. Styke jumped. Ibana leaned in the\ndoorway, eyeing his naked body. “I don’t remember you being so wrinkly.”\nStyke didn’t bother to look down at his scarred, pitted body. She was\nright. His skin looked like a tomato left out in the sun too long. He’d never\nreally thought about the wrinkles before. “You still look good,” he\nresponded.\n“Don’t try to sweet-talk me.”\n“Just stating a fact. Everyone ages. You did it way better than me.”\n“Yeah,” Ibana responded, “but you started off prettier.”\n“I guess we’re even, then.”\n“On that account. Yeah.” Ibana cleared her throat and hawked a wad\ninto the chamber pot from across the room. “But you’ve got a lot of\ncatching up to do on all the others. Now, you said this whole thing\ninvolving my father wasn’t supposed to be about Fidelis Jes. You said you\ngot out of the labor camp without violence.”\nStyke grimaced. He’d planned on telling her. Eventually. “I’d hoped you\nmissed that.”\n“Not a chance. Tell me what’s going on. All of it.”\nSo Styke did. He started with the parole hearing, told her about Tampo,\nthen joining the Riflejacks. He told her about the dragonman, the Dynize,\nand the Palo. He talked until his throat was raw, and Ibana stood there\nunmoving through the whole thing. When he finished he looked around for\nhis pants, only to find a new pair hanging by the washbasin.\n“Is the girl yours?”\nStyke froze, the pants around his ankles, one leg raised. “Celine?”\n“Yeah.

He finished pulling the pants on and buckled the belt.\n“But you didn’t father her in the camps?”\n“No. Her dad was a thief. Died mucking the marshes. Where is she?”\nIbana’s tone softened. “She’s downstairs playing with Gamble. He says\nshe’s just a few years younger than his daughters would have been if they\nsurvived the war, the sap.”\nStyke let out a soft sigh. The fact that, after all this, Celine was safe and\nclose by was as comforting as waking up with a working hand. When he\nturned back Ibana had a strange half smile on her face. She uncrossed her\narms and lifted her chin toward him. She seemed satisfied that Celine\nwasn’t his by blood, and the fact she cared was somehow comforting to\nStyke.\n“That’s quite the story you told,” Ibana said. “So what are you going to\ndo now?”\n“I’m not sure.” Styke didn’t trust that smile. It meant Ibana already\nknew how this conversation was going to end. It was unnerving. “I’ve got\ntwo masters right now. Tampo and Lady Flint.”\n“And do you owe either of them anything?”\n“I owe Tampo my freedom. And I owe Lady Flint…” Styke frowned.\nHe wasn’t sure what he owed Lady Flint. She’d given him a job – a purpose\n– and the fact that he felt a modicum of guilt over the false pretenses he’d\nused told him all he needed to know. “I like Lady Flint. I like Olem and the\nRiflejacks. They warned me that the Blackhats were coming for me.”\n“You have obligations.”\n“I have obligations,” Styke agreed. He was torn. He couldn’t go back to\nLady Flint. He didn’t know how to contact Tampo and even if he did, was\nhe any use to Tampo now that he was on the Blackhats’ shit list? His best\nbet was to disappear. He could take Celine and head north. Catch a ship to\nGurla or the Nine and be beyond Fidelis Jes’s reach within a few weeks.\nVanishing into thin air would be its own sort of vengeance. Jes would lie\nawake at night, wondering when the knife would come out of the dark,\nwhile Styke slept peacefully half a world away.\n“You didn’t mention your other obligations.”\nStyke raised his eyebrows. “You?”\n“You bet your ass me. And everyone else.”\n“What do you mean?”\nIbana advanced into the room. “Have you forgotten the men and women\ndownstairs? The Blackhats attacked your whole officer corps – everyone\nstill alive, that is. They burned businesses, destroyed homes, beat some of\nour friends within an inch of their lives.”\nStyke’s chest tightened and he looked away. “I… I’ve got nothing to\noffer them.”\n“Don’t look away from me. I will break your nose, and then I’ll go to\nwork on your fingers. Those people would die for you, and all you can do is"

Those people would die for you, and all you can do is\navert your eyes out of self-pity? You’ll give them something, even if it’s one\nlast ride into glory and death. You’re goddamned Mad Ben Styke.”\n“A ride?” Styke asked. “What would we ride against? There is no great\nempire battering down our doors this time.”\n“The Blackhats,” Ibana suggested.\n“The Blackhats,” Styke said, nodding. He held up his hand, suddenly\ncaught on his own words. He repeated his last sentence under his breath.\n“No great empire…” He looked Ibana in the eye. “The Dynize. Something\nis going on with the Dynize. I never found out what, but with dragonmen in\nthe city they have to be planning something.”\n“Dragonmen.” Ibana snorted. “Then we have two groups to ride\nagainst.”\nStyke’s heart leapt at the idea. The Mad Lancers together again,\nprepared to fight through the teeth of whatever the world could throw at\nthem. A week ago – pit, an hour ago – it would have seemed a silly thought,\nbut now here it was. “Seems like a lot of enemies.”\n“Never bothered us before.”\n“What happened to our armor?” Styke asked. “Last I heard, Lindet was\ngoing to have it destroyed.”\n“Last I heard, too,” Ibana said with a scowl.\n“Enchanted armor is priceless. She wouldn’t destroy it.”\n“It’s Lindet.”\nStyke nodded. That was all Ibana needed to stay. He reached for his\nknife, his hand coming up empty, and remembered the sound of it clattering\naway across the cobbles after Jes’s victory. Ibana’s eyes followed the\ngesture, and Styke said quickly, “I’ll get it back.” He walked toward the\ndoor, then thought better of it, opening the window and looking down into\nthe street. He wasn’t ready to face his old officer corps. Not yet. He began\nto climb through the window.\n“What are you doing?” Ibana demanded.\n“Keep everyone here,” he said. “If you have to move to avoid the\nBlackhats, leave word for me at Grandma Sender’s.”\n“Where are you going?”\nStyke remembered what Jes had whispered just before having him\ncarted off. I can’t kill you. She won’t allow it. “It’s long past time I had a\ntalk with the one who holds Fidelis Jes’s leash.”\nCHAPTER 43\nM\nichel jogged up the steps to the Millinery courtyard, Gold Rose\ndangling from a chain around his neck, tapping gently against his\nchest.

Silver Roses were, technically, just one rank\nunder a Gold Rose. But there were a lot of Silver Roses, and he’d always\nremained in the shadows, working alone, only taking advantage of his rank\nwhen he needed a couple of bodyguards or someone roughed up.\nA few days ago the idea of bossing around a few dozen Iron and Bronze\nRoses had been a novel one, though ill-fitting. Now he was expected to take\ncharge of more than six hundred Roses of all ranks and conduct a search for\nBenjamin Styke and a whole company of angry veterans.\n“How hard will it be to find three hundred or so retired cavalry?” he\nasked himself.\n“I don’t know,” he responded sarcastically. “How about you wander into\nthe streets and ask around for the lancer unit that put the entire Kez army on\nedge?”\n“That was ten years ago. They’re all washed up.”\n“Tell that to the guards at the labor camp they set fire to last night.”\nMichel rubbed his eyes. He wasn’t going to be alone in the search. Oh,\ndefinitely not. More than ten thousand Blackhats and twice that many in\ncity police were currently combing the streets. He wondered how the pit\nthis had been his first assignment, before remembering the wild look in\nJes’s eye when he demanded Styke’s head. Every single Gold Rose – and\neveryone under them – had been told to look for Styke.\nHe wondered what his next assignment would be once Styke had been\nfound and put down. His only real expertise was spycraft. Maybe Jes would\nallow him to organize the Blackhats’ spies and let him set up a real training\nprogram. He’d daydreamed a hundred times what kind of changes he’d\nmake if he were in charge, and now that looked like a real possibility.\nPut him in charge of information, and he could bring the whole\norganization to its knees.\nMichel slapped himself sharply, letting the pain bring him back to his\nsenses. He still hadn’t managed to put the real Michel back into his marble,\nand he could feel it slipping through. He needed to focus. He was a Gold\nRose, and he needed to act and think exactly like one. He needed to blend in\nand do his job.\nExcept now he didn’t just have to work and wait. He had an active\nassignment from Taniel to find these so-called godstones.\n“Sir,” a voice said. Michel glanced up to find Agent Warsim\napproaching from down the fortifications. Warsim had been present for\nabout a third of Michel’s new briefing as he, too, had been promoted – to\nMichel’s second in command. He wore his new Silver Rose proudly around\nhis neck and nodded respectfully. “Didn’t expect to find you up here, sir.”\n“Just, uh…” Michel glanced down into the courtyard, where Blackhats\nrushed back and forth, prison wagons being loaded down and sent out and\nmen coming in with reports. He couldn’t say he came up here to try to sort\nout the two different sides of his personality. “Watching the chaos for a\nmoment.” He shaded his eyes with one hand and wondered if he was ever"

He’d managed just two hours this\nmorning after Dellina’s briefing ended.\n“I’ve assembled your Roses as you asked,” Warsim said.\n“I did? Oh, right. Very good. We’re supposed to be looking for this\nStyke, correct?”\nWarsim shuffled his feet nervously, a confused expression on his face.\n“That’s right, sir.”\n“Okay, where?”\n“Um, everywhere, sir.”\n“I meant us, specifically.”\nWarsim seemed to process this latest question. “Everywhere, sir.”\nMichel opened his mouth, then closed it again. “Hm.” Warsim was by\nno means an idiot, but he’d never struck Michel as particularly smart, either.\nHis advancement to Silver Rose was a fluke – or rather, Michel had\nrequested it personally. Michel needed someone he knew reasonably well,\nwho wouldn’t ask questions, and took very little personal initiative. “Okay,\nwhere is everyone else searching? Let’s start with eliminating those areas.”\n“I’m afraid that it’s not very organized,” Warsim said, producing a thick\nfile from beneath his arm and flipping through it. “Controller Britt has his\nmen searching all of Styke’s old haunts and known associates. Other than\nthat…” He ended with a shrug.\n“It’s a bloody free-for-all?”\n“Yes, sir.”\nMichel turned away and rolled his eyes so hard it hurt. The most feared\norganization on this side of the planet, and the Blackhats fell to pieces once\nFidelis Jes went out of sorts. Controller Britt was the seniormost Gold Rose,\nwith two thousand men under his command, so he had claimed the easy\nstuff. Everyone else was now scrambling, hoping to be the first ones to find\nStyke and, probably, get some kind of favor with Jes and Lindet.\nIt was the first inkling Michel had that there was a pecking order even\namong the Gold Roses, and it did not please him. “Maybe I won’t be getting\nto do as I like after all,” he muttered to himself.\n“What’s that, sir?” Warsim asked.\n“Nothing.” Michel resisted the urge to give himself another slap. Focus.\nYou can be a Gold Rose and accomplish your real goal. If you can’t, you’ll\nhave done all this work for nothing. Michel turned his attention back to the\nchaos, trying to come up with some kind of plan. “You’ve got a military\nbackground, don’t you?” he asked Warsim.\n“I do, sir. Major in the infantry right after the war.”\n“You understand drilling, lines, grids, patterns. Correct?”\nWarsim shifted. “I suppose so, sir?”\n“Fantastic. Because I bloody well don’t. Take our men down to the\ndocks. Lots of places to hide down there. Search every ship at moor. I want\nreports on my desk every hour.”\n“Yes, sir!” Warsim turned to go, but Michel stopped him with a word.\n“Oh, and Warsim?”\n“Yes, sir?”\n“How many men do you think we have left in the Millinery?” He\nwatched as the last of the prison wagons left the courtyard, a lone Iron Rose"

Everyone’s out looking for Styke.”\n“Right. Get going.”\nMichel chewed on the inside of his cheek as he watched Warsim sprint\ndown the stairs and then through the Millinery gate and down the street.\nMichel could go down and oversee the search himself. It’s what all the\nother Gold Roses were doing. He could get some rest and try to digest\neverything that Dellina had briefed him on last night, including state secrets\nthat he was sure Taniel would love to get his hands on – half of which he’d\nalready forgotten.\nHe could bide his time, waiting for this Styke thing to blow over and\nsecuring his new place among the Gold Roses, becoming indispensable and\ntrusted until he could just walk in and ask for any secrets he could possibly\nwant to know.\nThe Millinery was all but empty. The chaos might be enough to conceal\nanything he got up to between now and whenever Warsim started to bring\nhim reports.\nAnd what the pit, Michel felt the need to do something really\ndangerous.\nThe Millinery archives had two sections. One was almost like a private\nlibrary for the Blackhats. It contained criminal records, city ordinances,\nduplicates of police reports, and a hundred other useful types of information\nthat anyone from Bronze Rose on up had access to at all times. It occupied\nthree floors of the west wing of the Millinery and had a half dozen\nattendants, but Michel had often gone an entire day there without meeting\nanother soul.\nThe second section of the archives was on the fourth floor of the west\nwing. It was accessible by a single stairway in one corner of the lower\narchives, which itself was blocked by a thick iron gate.\nMichel entered the archives on the first floor and made his way up,\ncareful to avoid the two attendants and three Blackhats he passed. By the\ntime he’d reached the third floor his hands shook, and he wondered what he\nhad gotten himself into.\n“You’re a spy, Michel,” he muttered to himself. “Pull it together.”\n“I can be nervous if I want to.”\n“Oh, shut up. You’re trembling like the first time you ever nicked a\npurse. You can do this.”\n“Can I? If I get caught it won’t be for nicking a purse. I’ll be tortured\nand killed.”\n“No you won’t, you fool. You’re a Gold Rose now. You’re supposed to\nbe here.”\nDellina’s briefing the night before had included a brief overview of the\nupper archives. Extremely brief. The upper archives were for necessary use\nonly, and someone would give him the tour once this whole Styke mess was\nover.\n“What if someone asks why you’re here? What will you say then?”\n“You’ll come up with something. You always do.”\n“That’s a terrible plan.”\n“Says you.”\n“You should wait,” he whispered.\n“Coward,” he muttered back at himself, and headed toward the locked\nstairwell in the corner.

He passed row after row of high shelves, stacked two\nrows deep with crates and paper boxes – all the secrets of Landfall. He\nreached the iron gate, checked over one shoulder, and knelt down in front of\nit to examine the lock.\nIt was not a basic keyhole. There was a slight, rounded indentation with\nseven wavy lines, each appearing to catch a separate mechanism. The lock\nitself was thick enough that blasting powder might not even be able to break\nit, and the mechanisms were protected behind polished steel.\nHe checked the hinges and the iron gate, noting that it didn’t budge even\nin the slightest. “If I were a betting man, I’d say this is warded.”\n“You don’t want anything to do with sorcery,” he said back to himself.\n“Right.” He knelt down, turning his attention back to the lock before\nfrowning. Those seven wavy lines looked awfully familiar. He touched\nthem gently with one finger, frowning, until it dawned on him. Like the\ninverse of a Rose.\nHe drew the Gold Rose out of his shirt and looked at it closely, noting\nthat there was a small raised portion in the center that his Silver Rose didn’t\nhave. Holding it in two fingers, rose out, he pressed the medallion into the\nlock and turned.\nThere was a series of clicks, then the sound of steel striking steel. The\ngate swung open at his touch.\n“That,” he whispered, “was too stupidly easy.”\nHe left the gate slightly ajar and took the stairs to the fourth floor. As he\nentered the room he realized just how flawed his plan was.\nThe upper archives was as large as any of the floors beneath it. The long\nroom had vaulted ceilings, and high windows cast lines of afternoon light\nthrough the swirling dust. Dozens of rows of files went on for at least a\nhundred feet, leaving him thousands of boxes, books, and files to look\nthrough. It would take months to search all of it.\nAll for a reference to these godstones Taniel needed found.\nHe searched the closest shelves for some kind of index, hoping that\nwhoever kept the upper archives in order followed the same protocols as the\nattendants who took care of the lower archives.\nNothing.\nHe walked down the rows, tapping his fingers on boxes, hoping to find\nsomething that looked promising. He took out boxes at random, removing\ncloth-bound notebooks and single, apparently unrelated pieces of paper,\nleafing through them gently. One vellum manuscript appeared to be brand-\nnew, while another note card crumbled to dust the moment his fingers\ntouched it.\nHe sneezed, scattering the remains across two aisles.\n“That’s probably not good,” he said under his breath, quickly heading to\nthe next row of files. He was at once curious and terrified, listening to the\nsteady thump of his own heart as he remained acutely aware of the open\ngate at the bottom of the stairs, and the unknown consequences if he was\ncaught up here.\n“Remember,” he said to himself, “if someone finds you, pretend to\nbelong here. People rarely question someone who looks like they know\nwhat they’re doing.”"

People rarely question someone who looks like they know\nwhat they’re doing.”\nHe’d tested the theory on dozens of occasions, but somehow this place\nwas far more taboo than any other he’d attempted to bluff his way through.\nThe fact he didn’t actually know if he was allowed to be here made his\nnerves all the worse.\nHe finally found an index at the far end of the hall. It took fifteen\nminutes to figure out how it was ordered, and another five to find what he\nwas looking for, each of those minutes ticking by loudly on his pocket\nwatch, precipitating dozens of nervous glances toward the stairs.\nA long search provided him with a single volume labeled Godstone. He\nopened it eagerly, leafing through the pages for several seconds before his\nheart fell.\nThe whole thing was written in Old Deliv. He could recognize it, but not\nread a lick.\nHe flipped to the front page, wondering if he should try to steal the book\nand hand it over to Taniel, who could probably find a translator, or take the\ntime to copy a couple of pages.\n“Hello?” A voice drifted through the stacks, echoing off the vaulted\nceilings. “Is someone up here?”\nMichel took several deep breaths to calm himself. He knew where this\nwas now. He could come back. Carefully, he went to close the book and put\nit back but his eye was caught by something written in pencil on the first\npage.\nIt was a number, not in Deliv numerals, but in Kressian. It looked like a\nstreet address. Beside it were the words, scribbled quickly, I found it.\nHe memorized the address, slid the book back in its place, and\nstraightened his jacket.\n“Hello?” The voice had an edge to it now. “You’re supposed to check in\nwhen you come to the upper archives. I’m going to have to report this to the\ngrand master.”\nMichel’s initial thought to step out and flash his Gold Rose was\nimmediately cast aside. He went to the end of his row and glanced around\nthe corner, catching sight of an old woman wearing a deep frown, clicking\nalong the marble floor with her cane.\nMichel timed her steps before heading down a few aisles and making\nhis way to the other end of the archives. He dashed for the stairs, hearing a\nvoice call out behind him, “You there! Stop!”\nHe was down the stairs a moment later, then down two more flights and\nout of the archives, managing to avoid all of the archivists and patrons on\nhis way out. Within minutes he was back in his office, heart thumping in his\nchest. He immediately found a pencil and paper and jotted down the address\nbefore he could forget, then sat down and stared at it for several minutes.\nCould this be the location of the godstones? A warehouse, perhaps?\nSomething for sorcerous items?\nThere was a knock on his door, causing him to jump so high he knocked\nthe chair over, spilling him backward onto the floor. He recovered, rubbing\nthe side of his head, and opened the door a crack.\nTo his relief, it was Warsim.\n“Sir,” Warsim said, “I’ve got the first report.”\n“Find anything?”"

How about you tell\nme when we have found something.” He shut the door in Warsim’s face and\nrighted his chair, collapsing into it. Several minutes passed before he was\nable to gather himself. He pulled the address out of his pocket and looked it\nover, muttering it under his breath.\nNothing to do but go find out what it meant.\nCHAPTER 44\nS\ntyke tarried until dusk in a small town about seven miles due west of\nLandfall. The town was called Szada, and when he was a boy it had been\ndistant and isolated from the Landfall Plateau, just a sleepy stopping point\non the mail route to Redstone. Now it had tripled in size – though it still\nboasted a population of less than a thousand – and was practically a suburb\nof the Fatrastan capital.\nHe left town as the sun disappeared beneath the horizon and headed\nnorth across the marshes, picking his way through the dangerous, soggy\ngrounds, relying on the experience of old memories to guide him. He wore\na dark, mottled cloak with the hood up, and had borrowed a knife from\nIbana. He wondered not if, but rather how much use it would get before the\nnight was over.\nThe sky was almost entirely black when he finally spotted lights in the\ndistance. He knew their source even before he made out the dark, brooding\nsilhouette of the brick manor standing guard over the marshes. As he drew\ncloser the light became well-defined candles placed at regular intervals in\nthe windows of the sprawling manor.\nWillowhaven House.\nThe soil eventually firmed, marking the edge of the manicured lawns\naround Willowhaven. Styke crouched low, moving between the shadows of\nthe eponymous willows and the border of hedgerows that surrounded the\ngrounds. The bob of lanterns marked the path of the chancellorian guard.\nHe waited and watched, counting out the rhythm of their patrol for more\nthan an hour before finally making his final approach toward the manor.\nWillowhaven was dark and foreboding. Even the candles in the\nwindows seemed cold and distant, imbuing the house with a bleak\nloneliness. The lack of any movement inside, whether from servants or the\nLady Chancellor herself, was disconcerting. Styke wondered if she’d\nchosen to spend this night in the city and decided it didn’t matter.\nHe needed to send a message regardless.\nHe entered through the side door of the carriage house, passing by the\nstraw-filled stalls of the workhorses, running one hand absently along the\nwarm noses that poked out to greet him. He patted the last one and stamped\ngently on the floor before reaching down and finding an iron ring by feel\nand memory."

He patted the last one and stamped\ngently on the floor before reaching down and finding an iron ring by feel\nand memory.\nWithin moments he was ten feet below ground level, feeling his way\nthrough the dark, damp passageway that led toward the house. He emerged\nsometime later from behind a salt barrel in the manor’s pantry, and slipped\npast the snoring form of the on-call chef. Styke felt his heart begin to\nhammer in his chest and slid the borrowed knife from his pocket.\nFew people kept a chef on call in the middle of the night, but a midnight\nsnack was one of the few joys Lindet had ever allowed herself.\nShe was most definitely home.\nStyke crept up the stairs, light on his feet, avoiding all the worst creaks.\nThe candles in the windows cast small, flickering amounts of light on the\nironwood floors and banister, illuminating the art-covered walls and the old-\nstyle pillars with busts of long-dead philosophers and saints. The decoration\nwas as it always had been in Willowhaven – rich, but demure – and Styke\nfelt nostalgia tightening his chest.\nHe reached the master bedroom at the end of the hall and paused. The\ndoor was slightly ajar. He pushed on it gently, grip tightening on his knife.\nThe room was as he remembered it – obscenely large, with ironwood-\npaneled walls, an enormous four-poster bed with mahogany curtains,\nflanked on either side by a nightstand. There was a wing-back chair by the\nwindow, a lantern burning low beside it, and Styke could see the ember tip\nof a lit cigarillo. A shadow moved within the wings of the chair, and a\ndelicate hand reached out to turn up the lamp.\n“Hello, Ben.”\nStyke was immediately struck by how Lindet had lost the soft edges of\nher youth. She had grown gaunt over the years, and at thirty-three all the\nsoftness had been hammered out of her until only iron remained. She wore\na pair of spectacles that cast shadows on her face. Her skin was naturally\npale, her hair like strands of yellow silk. Her lips were thin, her chin strong,\nand even in her nightclothes she exuded a calm, dismissive air that gave\nStyke the urge to apologize for entering and back out of the room.\nHe stepped inside, slowly closing the door. “Lindet.”\nPeople always commented, privately, on Lindet’s eyes. They were a\nsteady blue like the sky on a clear day, and those who saw them often swore\nthat an actual fire burned deep within. Some called it sorcery, some an\nembodiment of Lindet’s ambition. The reflection of the lamp on the lenses\nof her spectacles cast a double likeness, one that seemed to dance\nindependent of the flame that cast it. Styke noted something hanging over\none arm of her wing-back chair.\nIt was his faded yellow cavalry jacket. The one he’d handed to Fidelis\nJes’s secretary before he’d fought the grand master. Lindet’s left hand\nclutched the jacket tightly, her knuckles white, the only break in her cool\nfacade. Styke wanted to cross the distance between them.

A single stroke, a\nsplash of crimson for the ten years he spent alone in the labor camps after\nall he did to help her win Fatrasta’s freedom.\nInstead, he did a slow circuit of the room, checking the bed and closets\nfor hidden assassins until he was satisfied he and Lindet were alone.\nLindet’s eyes followed him around the room, that perpetual flame beneath\nher spectacles her only movement save for the occasional rise and fall of\nher chest. The ash on her cigarillo grew long.\n“You ordered my execution,” he finally said.\nLindet took several moments to answer. “Who told you that?”\n“Who else would have ordered it?”\n“The way I understand it,” Lindet replied, “you disobeyed a direct\norder. I didn’t have to order anything. My officers simply carried out\nprotocol by having a mutinous colonel put in front of a firing squad.”\nStyke’s memories of the day were hazy. He remembered a lot of\nshouting, a skillful disarmament of his Mad Lancers under false pretenses\nbefore he was separated from them and forced up against a stake and tied in\nplace. He hadn’t fought back at first. Nobody expected to have to fight their\nown allies. When he finally realized what was happening, it was too late.\nFidelis Jes had been there, and he’d brought a lot of men.\n“Nothing happens without your say-so,” Styke said. “Certainly not my\nexecution.”\nLindet snorted. “I am not omnipotent. And you did disobey a direct\norder.”\n“So you didn’t order me killed?”\n“No.”\nStyke fingered his borrowed knife. “I don’t believe you.”\n“That’s not my concern.”\n“It should be.”\nLindet’s eyes dipped to the knife and she finally ashed her cigarillo over\na pewter mug next to the lamp. She took a deep breath, as if this whole\nthing was quite troublesome, and said, “I received a message at two forty-\nseven that you had disobeyed a direct order and were to be shot. I\ndispatched a messenger at two fifty-six countermanding the order. My\nmessenger arrived after the second volley. You were immediately taken\ndown from in front of the firing squad and treated by the present physicians.\nThey declared you dead and for three days you were left to rot.” Lindet\nspoke in a monotone, as if she were reciting from a journal.\n“But I didn’t die.”\n“No,” Lindet said. “I recovered what was left of you as soon as I was\nable – ”\n“Three days later,” Styke interjected.\n“I’d just won a war. It was a busy time. As I said, I recovered your body\nthree days later and was rather startled to discover you still alive. You were\ntreated and sent to the Sweetwallow Labor Camp with orders that your\nname be struck from the record and Colonel Benjamin Styke declared\ndead.” Lindet’s forehead wrinkled, and she dropped the cold monotone.\n“But you were not dead. I made sure of that. I never wanted you dead,\nBen.”\nStyke turned away from Lindet, examining the room in the shadowing\nflicker of the lamplight. He remembered this room well. It still looked the"

    "text": "Ben.”\nStyke turned away from Lindet, examining the room in the shadowing\nflicker of the lamplight. He remembered this room well. It still looked the\nsame – it still smelled the same – and he wondered how she could bear to\nstay here.\n“I believe,” Lindet said, “that I am incapable of having you killed.”\nStyke heard the scoff escape his mouth. “I believe you’re capable of\nhaving the gods killed if it suits your purpose.”\n“The gods have nothing to do with you and me,” Lindet responded.\n“You’ve always been a pain in the ass. You’ve always flaunted orders,\nignored your superiors, protected my enemies, and killed my allies.\nEveryone in my inner circle hated you – they hated you so much – but I\nwouldn’t let them touch you. I protected you until Fidelis Jes realized the\nsame thing I did, that I was incapable of having you killed, and took the\ninitiative.”\n“And you let him,” Styke accused. “Even if I didn’t die, you still killed\nme. No, I take that back. Sending me to Sweetwallow was worse than\nhaving me killed. You took everything away from me, even my name.” His\nfingers tightened on the knife again.\n“Sometimes kindness can be cruel.”\n“You like to think that, don’t you? You like to think that your unbending\nwill is all that stands between this country and oblivion, and that only you\ncan see the way through. It’s why you suppress the weak, marginalize the\npoor, crush the Palo, and crave control.”\n“I’ve seen the future, Ben,” Lindet said quietly. “And I am the only one\nthat can see the way through.”\nStyke walked over to Lindet’s chair and put one hand on the wing-back,\nleaning close to look into her eyes. She stared back, coldly. The absence of\neven a tremble was more disconcerting than it would have been had she\nbegged for her life. But that was Lindet. It always had been. It always\nwould be. She believed every word she said.\n“You could have had one of your Privileged heal me.”\n“To what end? The war was over. The Mad Lancers were an immediate\nliability. It was time to bury our monsters and move on.”\n“You didn’t bury Fidelis Jes.”\n“I needed him. Same as I still need him. Had you remained free, you\nwould have killed him for what he did to you.”\n“I still plan on it.”\n“And I find that incredibly inconvenient.” A note of peevishness entered\nher voice, and Styke almost laughed.\n“But you still let me in here.” Lindet’s eyebrows rose, and Styke\ncontinued: “I could smell the wards coming in. I could sense your\nPrivileged. You keep this place locked down tighter than a king’s asshole,\nand yet you still let me come here.”\n“I felt we needed to talk.”\n“You planning on having me killed on the way out?”\n“As I said,” Lindet responded, “I don’t believe I’m capable of having\nyou killed.”\n“Bullshit,” Styke spat.\nAll this time he had remained leaning over her, their faces so close their\nnoses almost touched.

Lindet put out a finger and firmly but gently pushed\nhim away. “Do you remember the night you killed our father?”\nStyke turned away to hide his shock. He couldn’t remember the last\ntime either of them had acknowledged their kinship. Probably more than\ntwenty-five years. “I try not to,” he said, his voice catching in his throat.\n“It’s not a happy memory.”\n“It is for me,” Lindet shot back. “I was three and a half. You were what,\ntwelve? Thirteen? I screamed when I found him standing over Mother’s\nbody. He came for me, that bloody knife still in his hand.” Lindet’s voice\nbecame breathy and animated, her eyes looking over Styke’s shoulder as if\nshe was witnessing a vision of the past. She gestured absently toward the\ndoor. “It was right down the hall. They’ve never been able to scrub all of\nMother’s blood out of that rug.”\n“You could have burned it.”\n“I keep it as a reminder of what cruel men do with power. Anyway, you\nput yourself between me and Father. To this day he is still the strongest,\nevilest man I’ve ever met and when he came for me you broke him. That is\nwhy I cannot have you killed, brother of mine.”\nStyke closed his eyes and forced himself to recall the past. They’d\nabandoned Willowhaven after their parents’ deaths. They’d disappeared and\nchanged their names, and eventually Styke had risen to power in the army,\nLindet in politics. She’d bought this horrid place – though he never\nunderstood why – and kept it as her home though few living souls knew the\nsignificance of its history.\nThey’d gone their separate ways, but had always remained intertwined.\n“You never told me you remembered that night,” he whispered. “I\nthought you were too young.”\n“You never asked.”\nHe could remember spotting the specter of his father standing over his\nmother’s fresh corpse, smelling of whiskey at twenty paces. Lindet stood in\nthe doorway to her room, a stuffed bear clutched to her chest, screaming so\nloud it would have awoken the servants had Father not sent them all away.\nHe remembered Father advancing on Lindet, bellowing for silence, and him\nrunning to put himself between them.\nOne teenage kid against the giant of a man he’d inherited his size from.\nStyke still had scars from that fight.\nHe put Ibana’s knife back in his pocket. “I’m not going back to\nSweetwallow.”\n“I didn’t think you would,” Lindet said, as if the possibility had most\ncertainly crossed her mind.\n“But you won’t call your dogs off.”\nHe waited for her to say that she couldn’t – that Fidelis Jes and the\nBlackhats were beyond her control, and that she could not bring them to\nheel if she wanted. Instead she shook her head and handed him his old\ncavalry jacket. For the first time he noticed that there was something else\nwith the jacket – a bit of white cloth not much bigger than his palm.

On it\nwas a lance holding aloft a bare skull, flag swirling around them both; it\nwas a scrap of flag, the emblem of the Mad Lancers.\n“They found that flag in the remains of Sweetwallow Labor Camp. Jes\nis still trying to track down all the inmates that were released – including\nyou – and he’s been sending me messengers all day demanding I bring in\nthe army. This morning he tried to deputize Lady Flint and her mercenaries\nto help find you.”\nThe prospect gave Styke pause. He didn’t want to fight the Riflejacks.\nHe wouldn’t win. “Did he?”\n“Lady Flint’s last contract is over. She would not accept another one.\nBut if you and your lancers cause enough trouble, I will call in the army.”\nStyke suppressed a sigh of relief. Fatrastan soldiers he could deal with.\n“Where is my armor?”\nLindet lifted her chin. “I destroyed it.”\n“Three hundred sets of enchanted medieval armor, and you destroyed it?\nThat was art.”\n“I believe you found it in a Kez art collection,” Lindet said. “But yes, I\ndestroyed it. Your lancers ran down whole armies in that armor, and proved\nthat relics like that are too dangerous to be left intact.”\nStyke definitely didn’t believe her this time. Lindet was not in the habit\nof destroying art – and she didn’t destroy things that might still be of some\nuse to her. For ten years he thought he was the exception to that rule, but if\nshe was telling the truth about his execution, then there was no exception.\nHe studied her face, considering pressing her further, but he knew her\nstubbornness reached even deeper than his.\n“I could call off my dogs,” she suddenly said.\nStyke’s eyes narrowed. “In exchange for… ?”\n“I could re-form the Lancers, make them my personal entourage. I’d\nrestore all the personal property the Blackhats have destroyed this week and\nreturn your rank. You’d have uniforms, horses, pensions.”\nStyke scowled. Lindet had always been cold and calculating, ten steps\nahead of her opponents, but since she was a child she would occasionally be\nstruck by some ill-conceived fancy. This sounded exactly like that. It was a\npractical, win-win situation. But it wouldn’t work. “Their lives have already\nbeen destroyed. You can’t undo the past, no matter how much you try. And I\nwill kill Fidelis Jes.”\n“It was just a thought,” Lindet said, dismissing it with the flip of a wrist\nas she ashed her cigarillo. “Despite what you may think, I do, from time to\ntime, try to make everyone happy.”\n“This doesn’t end happily. For anyone,” Styke warned.\n“I know.”\nLindet suddenly stood up, crossing the few feet between them and\nputting her hand against Styke’s face, turning him first one way and then\nthe other to examine the pitted scar where the firing squad bullet had\nbounced off his cheekbone. “In the morning,” she said, “I have a country to\nrun. I exist to instill order and protect this country – even from itself. Fidelis\nJes will ask me to permit your death. I will, reluctantly, agree.”"

I will, reluctantly, agree.”\n“I feel like this would go much more smoothly if you just had one of\nthose Privileged hiding out in the bushes cut me apart with sorcery.”\n“We’ve been over that. I cannot have you killed.”\n“But Fidelis Jes…”\nLindet snatched the emblem of the Mad Lancers from his hand and\nthrust it in his face. She had nothing else to say, returning to her chair and\ngripping the armrests like a monarch on her throne. “Because I am weak,\nyou and Fidelis Jes will destroy each other. Because I am weak, my\nBlackhats and the Mad Lancers will go to war. As I am weak, so shall this\ncountry be. You should go, before I find some inner strength.”\nStyke suddenly understood. There was a long way from ordering a\nman’s death without his knowing – like what had been done to him ten\nyears ago – and giving him the chance to fight back. She was allowing him\nthat chance, even if the odds were stacked well against him. “One of us\nshould finish this now and save Fatrasta the grief.”\n“Can either of us?”\nStyke considered the knife in his pocket, and the little girl he saved so\nmany years ago. “No.”\n“I didn’t think so. All I ask is that you consider that which remains\nunseen.” Lindet’s voice dropped to a mere whisper. “A storm is coming,\nBen, the likes of which this world has never seen. I have tried to prepare for\nit, but for all my efforts I remain… fearful.”\nStyke tried to imagine what could possibly scare the woman who’d\nfaced down the Kez at the height of their empire. “The Dynize?” he asked.\n“The Dynize. The Palo. Our enemies and our allies. Our very own\nmachinations turned against us. I’ve tried to make Fatrasta strong enough to\nface what comes, but all our sins will be accounted for. I…” Lindet trailed\noff, shaking her head, and then treated Styke to one of her rare smiles.\nDespite her talk of fear, he could see the eagerness in her eyes. Whatever\nshe saw in the future, she could not wait to face it. “I don’t know enough.”\n“Well,” Styke said, hearing a creak on the floorboards somewhere in the\nhouse below them, “let me know when you do.” He wondered if it was a\nguard, or even the midnight chef. Regardless, he’d been here too long.\n“Good-bye, Lindet.”\n“Good-bye, Ben. Whatever happens, keep an eye on the horizon.”\nCHAPTER 45\nV\nlora loitered through the city for most of the day, finding a cheap but\ncomfortable hotel that evening and taking breakfast the next morning in\nthe sun at a cliffside café before finally wandering through the streets at\nrandom for several hours. It felt good to not be under contract, to not be in\nuniform. Back at the fort Olem would be getting the men ready to move\nout.

She felt bad leaving all the logistical work to him, but she needed this.\nShe needed to be a civilian again, if only for a couple of hours.\nThe Landfall city square was several blocks of public park a stone’s\nthrow from the capitol building. There were mature ironwood trees,\nmanicured shrubbery, cobble walking paths, and even a small pond. By the\ntime Vlora arrived a little before noon, the area was almost entirely covered\nwith people – several thousand at the very least. There was a volatile mix of\nangry Palo, wary Blackhats, and curious Kressians, all surrounding a high\ngallows in the middle of the otherwise pleasant park.\nVlora searched in vain for a vantage point from which to watch the\nexecution before sniffing a bit of powder and scaling one of the ironwood\ntrees, joining several rather surprised children on one thick, high limb. One\nof them, a boy of perhaps eleven, made a bit of space for her to perch on,\neyeballing her sword and pistol.\nThe spot gave her a clear view of the gallows, as well as the crowd\nmilling around it. Both the gallows and the crowd were absolutely crawling\nwith Blackhats – easily one in every three people present – and it took\nVlora only a few moments to realize why. Behind the gallows, flanked by a\npair of white-gloved Privileged sorcerers and completely encircled in\nheavily armed Blackhats, was Lady Chancellor Lindet.\nVlora had never actually seen Lindet, but she’d read her description in\nthe papers a number of times. The Lady Chancellor was a thin woman of\nmedium height with blond hair and a pair of spectacles that she removed\nevery so often to rub on her sleeve. The newspapers often described\nLindet’s eyes, and Vlora waited for some time for a good view before\nLindet turned to face her. Vlora’s light powder trance allowed her to see\nLindet as if they were standing nose to nose.\nLindet’s eyes did not disappoint. Deep-set, darkened by makeup,\nLindet’s gaze moved across the crowd again and again over the shoulders of\nher Blackhats. They were studious, critical, like a master craftsman\nchecking her tools. Vlora remembered Taniel’s letters mentioning how\nLindet might easily be mistaken for a librarian if not for those eyes, and\nhow they had made his throat go dry every time they lit upon him.\nLike so many of Taniel’s descriptions, Vlora had dismissed them as an\nexaggerated fancy, but when Lindet’s gaze swept past her she felt a tangible\npresence and her heart skipped a beat, though she couldn’t pinpoint why. It\nwasn’t fear, or awe, or anything she could put her finger on. Vlora felt like a\nschoolgirl again, ducking to avoid the critical eye of the stern headmistress.\n“Hey, lady,” the boy next to Vlora said.\nShe shook her head, leaving her study of Lindet and letting her eyes\nrefocus. “Yeah?”\n“When is this thing supposed to start?”\n“Noon,” Vlora said.\nThe boy squinted at the sun, and Vlora checked her pocket watch. It was\njust a few minutes till. The boy bounced up and down on the branch,"

The boy bounced up and down on the branch,\nmaking the whole tree shake.\n“I’d appreciate if you didn’t do that,” Vlora said.\n“You scared of heights?”\nVlora craned her head to look at the other children lined up on the\nbranch, then down at the twenty-foot drop. “Not really, but you’re gonna\nruin the pit out of my day if you knock someone else off.”\n“Oh, all right,” the boy said glumly. His attention turned to her pistol\nand sword. “Hey, you think there’s gonna be fighting? Da said that the Palo\nbitch was gonna hang high for stirrin’ up trouble.”\n“Don’t say bitch,” the girl next to him said, elbowing him in the ribs.\n“Well, that’s what Da said! Anyway, I hope there’s a fight.” He leaned\neagerly out from the branch. Vlora got herself ready to catch him if he fell.\n“Hangin’s happen all the time, but Da always makes us go inside during the\nriots.”\n“Probably smart of him,” Vlora commented absently. Her own attention\nmoved to the Blackhats as a group of them shoved forward through the\ncrowd, surrounding a prison wagon with white roses painted on the side. It\ncame to a slow stop in front of the gallows and the Blackhats fanned out,\npushing back the crowd, before opening the door. Mama Palo, looking\nrumpled and angry but no worse for the wear, was led out of the wagon.\nThere was a sudden cacophony, a shoving and shouting match between\nPalo and the Blackhats nearest the wagon, then Mama Palo was led up to\nthe gallows. Lindet, still flanked by her Privileged, climbed onto the\ngallows and waited patiently while the noose was draped around Mama\nPalo’s neck.\nVlora could feel the protective sorcery surrounding Lindet. If she had\nopened her third eye she would have seen splashes of sorcerous color. The\nLady Chancellor wasn’t taking any chances with this crowd.

Mama Palo looked smaller, older, and\nmore feeble in the light of day. Despite the pageantry and the obvious\nhopelessness of her situation, she managed to keep her chin up, her back\nstraight. Once the noose had been tightened around her neck she gave a\nsmall smile.\nFor some reason, that smile made Vlora nervous.\nVlora scanned the crowd again, wondering if there would be a rescue\noperation of some kind. She had no intention of interfering – her work here\nwas done – but anything the Palo mounted would be doomed to fail. She\nlooked again and again, scanning for weapons among the crowd, or large\ngroups of men, or anything that looked mildly organized. Nothing caught\nher eye.\nShe returned her gaze to Mama Palo.

Nothing caught\nher eye.\nShe returned her gaze to Mama Palo. The old woman continued to\nsmile, and Vlora wasn’t the only person who’d caught on to it. Lindet eyed\nher warily while her Privileged searched the crowd with the same deftness\nas Vlora. They seemed satisfied with the absence of a threat, but remained\nvigilant.\nVlora’s next check of the crowd caught sight of something peculiar, but\nit wasn’t at all what she expected.\nStanding near the edge of the park, leaning against a tree with his arms\nfolded, lips pursed, was Meln-Dun. The Palo businessman smoked a\ncigarette, his eyes glued to Mama Palo, and Vlora couldn’t help but wonder\nwhy he was here. He needed to be in Greenfire Depths, securing his power\nbase – making sure his family and business were still intact. Had he already\nmanaged it? Was he here out of spite? To be sure that Mama Palo did, in\nfact, hang?\n“Careful, lady, you’re gonna fall,” the boy next to Vlora warned.\nShe reached out to steady herself against the trunk of the tree and forced\nherself to settle down and watch the execution, though she couldn’t keep\nfrom looking toward Meln-Dun. It would be wise, she decided, to check in\nwith him, make sure everything had gone smoothly.\nShe was about to climb down from the tree when she spotted something\nthat made her skin crawl: A pair of dragonmen stood less than fifteen paces\nbehind Meln-Dun. They were powerful-looking Palo in gray, tailored suits\nand tinted spectacles, and they might have easily been mistaken for Palo\nbusinessmen but for the unmistakable black tattoos visible at their wrists\nand collars.\nAnd behind them, almost close enough to touch the pair, was Gregious\nTampo. Tampo was dressed to the nines and twirling a cane like he didn’t\nhave a care in the world. Vlora wasn’t sure which she was unhappier to see\n– Tampo or the dragonmen – and then, like the final piece of a puzzle fitting\nperfectly, everything fell into place.\nTampo had been at the party. He was in Mama Palo’s inner circle. Those\ndragonmen were there with him. And as she watched, they pushed through\nthe crowd toward Meln-Dun.\nVlora almost knocked a pair of kids off the branch as she leapt from the\ntree. She landed in a crouch, the pain of the impact barely registering\nthrough her powder trance, and tried to shout a warning.\n“Meln-Dun! Meln-Dun!”\nLindet had just begun to address the crowd, her voice amplified by\nPrivileged sorcery, and Vlora’s words were swallowed in the responding\nangry mutter of the mob. Vlora shoved her way through the crowd, tossing\na powder charge into her mouth and chewing it into a mush of paper and\ngrit, feeling the sorcery course through her veins.\nShe kicked and shoved, catching brief glimpses of Meln-Dun through\nthe crowd. The dragonmen were almost upon him, and then she lost all\nsight of them as the crowd began to churn in response to Lindet’s speech."

The dragonmen were almost upon him, and then she lost all\nsight of them as the crowd began to churn in response to Lindet’s speech.\nShe arrived at Meln-Dun’s tree, pistol drawn, only to spot him entering\nan alley with the two dragonmen. Gregious Tampo was nowhere to be seen.\nShe gave chase, her mind working desperately. Were the dragonmen not\nhere to rescue Mama Palo? Were there more of them behind the gallows,\npreparing to spring a trap? Vlora hesitated, wondering if she should warn\nLindet, but dismissed the notion. Lindet, after all, had two Privileged up\nthere with her. Meln-Dun was unprotected.\nVlora dashed down several alleys, jumping to see over the heads of the\nsprawling crowd, catching glimpses of gray suits from time to time. She\nhad gone nearly a block before catching sight of Meln-Dun walking into a\nsmall café followed by the two dragonmen. She charged along, her pistol\nheld discreetly at her side, eyes scanning the traffic for any sign of Tampo\nor more of the Dynize.\nShe reached the entrance of the café, checked the pan of her pistol, and\nimmediately ducked inside. Any moment she wasted might mean Meln-\nDun’s life.\nThe café was a long, narrow room. A handful of Kressians occupied\nchairs, sipping their noon tea. At the far end Meln-Dun and the two\ndragonmen slipped into a corner table while a Palo waiter brought them\niced tea.\nVlora froze in the doorway. Meln-Dun didn’t look like he was in danger.\nMeln-Dun leaned over to one of the dragonmen and said something, to\nwhich the other chuckled. He slapped the dragonman on the back and lifted\nhis gaze toward the doorway. Behind her, back in the park, Vlora heard the\nunmistakable sound of a trapdoor opening, and the angry response of the\ncrowd as Mama Palo was hanged for her crimes.\nVlora’s breath felt as if it had been snatched away from her as she\nunderstood – or thought she did. Meln-Dun’s family and business had never\nbeen in danger. The attacks on her men had been feints to lure her to Meln-\nDun’s side, and she had walked right into his trap, helping him take down\nMama Palo to secure power in Greenfire Depths, taking advantage of her\neagerness to carry out Lindet’s task. The dragonmen weren’t working for\nMama Palo.\nThey were working for Meln-Dun.\nAll that passed through Vlora’s head in an instant as Meln-Dun’s eyes\nmet hers. The Palo leapt to his feet, face turning red. Vlora hesitated,\nuncertain which of the three men across the café to put a bullet in. She’d\ncome here thinking she would protect a friend, but she wasn’t entirely sure\nif she could kill a single dragonman, let alone two. This was not a good\nfight.\n“Kill her,” Meln-Dun ordered.\nThe two dragonmen leapt from their seats. A café patron screamed, and\nVlora spun toward the door, ready to run. She’d lose them quickly in the\nstreet, get back to the fort, and —"

    "text": "The two dragonmen leapt from their seats. A café patron screamed, and\nVlora spun toward the door, ready to run. She’d lose them quickly in the\nstreet, get back to the fort, and —\nShe collided with a man’s chest, bouncing off it like she’d just run\nstraight into a brick wall. She looked up to find Tampo in front of her, and\nsnatched for her sword. His mouth opened, but she had no intention of\nletting him say a word. This was no coincidence; this was…\nThe thought was arrested as he snatched her by the wrist before she\ncould fully draw her sword. She snarled at him, tugging, unable to so much\nas move.\n“Sit down, Vlora,” Tampo said calmly, shoving her to one side. She\nlanded in a chair, almost tumbling to the floor, and was ready to come back\nup and at him in half a second only to find he had already stepped past her.\nThe cane in his hand clicked, and he drew the sword hidden within in a\nsingle, swift motion. The first dragonman moved impossibly quick, almost\nas fast as a powder mage, bone knife coming out and stabbing toward\nTampo’s chest.\nTampo was faster. Like a mongoose snatching a snake by the throat,\nTampo skewered the dragonman through the center of the chest, picking\nhim up and throwing him at his companion like he was no more than a rag\ndoll. The second dragonman dodged the flying body only to have Tampo\ngrab him by the wrist, producing an audible snap with a single twist, and\ndriving the dragonman’s head into the brick wall with the force of a draft\nhorse’s kick.\nThe whole fight was over in a handful of seconds. Meln-Dun fled out\nthe back even before the dragonmen had reached Tampo, and Vlora moved\nto give chase only to have her arm caught by Tampo. The lawyer\nmanhandled her out of the café and into the street before straightening his\njacket casually and linking arms with her forcefully. She tried to pull away,\nbut to no avail, and soon found herself walking briskly away from the scene\nof the crime.\nTampo whistled softly to himself, as if murdering a pair of legendary\nwarriors without breaking a sweat was just another item on his to-do list,\nright next to a reminder to pick up a loaf of bread. Vlora stopped fighting\nhim by the time they reached the next street over. She was in a daze, her\nmind tied in knots by what had just happened.\nShe knew of only one man capable of manhandling a powder mage, one\nman who might conceivably move so bloody fast. She’d not seen nor heard\nfrom him in ten years, and the last time they’d met he hadn’t been entirely\nhuman anymore – and he’d had access to the kind of mysterious sorcery\nthat might even be able to change his face and hide his sorcery.\nBesides, after all this time she still knew that pleased whistle.\n“Why are you here, Taniel?” she demanded.\nTaniel Two-shot, wearing another man’s face, lifted his hand to hail a\nhackney cab. “Because we need to have a talk.”\nCHAPTER 46\n“T\nhis isn’t a street address,” the clerk said."

    "text": "hackney cab. “Because we need to have a talk.”\nCHAPTER 46\n“T\nhis isn’t a street address,” the clerk said.\nMichel stood at the front of a long line in the Landfall commissioner’s\noffice while a middle-aged clerk looked at him over the top of her\nspectacles. She held his paper in her hand, arm outstretched to one side as if\nthe whole thing was a terrible inconvenience. Michel, wearing plainclothes\ninstead of a uniform, resisted the urge to pull out his Gold Rose and\nreminded himself he was trying to be as circumspect as possible.\n“You’re joking,” Michel said.\n“Nope.” She handed the paper back. “It’s not an address.”\nHe took it sourly, stuffing it in his pocket. “That explains why I couldn’t\nfind the damn place anywhere.”\n“Mm-hmm.” The clerk made a show of looking around him at the line.\n“Next!” she shouted, waving him away dismissively. “It’s not an address.\nIt’s a lot number. Probably south of the city.”\n“What do you mean, a lot number?” The next person in line approached\nthe desk and started talking, but Michel shoved himself back in front of the\nclerk. “Lot number?” he demanded.\n“Public land. South of the city.”\n“That’s the same as an address!”\n“Good day, sir. Next, please.”\nMichel wasn’t certain what to expect when he took a hackney cab two miles\nsouth of the outskirts of Landfall. There wasn’t much out here but farmland\n– endless floodplains covered in tobacco, cotton, and wheat. What he didn’t\nexpect was to find a camp.\nFrom a distance it resembled a labor camp. Acres upon acres had been\ncordoned off, a short palisade built to encircle countless rows of dirty tents.\nThere were a few wooden buildings in the center, beside a number of man-\nmade hills of soil, steaming in the summer heat like piles of shit. The camp\nhad been plopped right in the center of a cotton field, plants crushed\nunderfoot, muddy wagon ruts leading to and from the main road.\nAs he drew closer he caught sight of guards in yellow uniforms doing a\nfrequent circuit of the camp, carrying Hrusch rifles instead of truncheons –\na sure sign of a military presence. He vaguely remembered reading\nsomething in the newspaper about an archeology dig down here, but he\nhadn’t read the whole article. The local colleges had half of Landfall dug up\nlooking for Dynize relics, so one dig hadn’t stood out to him.\nThe cab came to a stop near one of the muddy paths leading to the\ncamp. Michel vacillated. Heading into camp didn’t seem advisable, not with\nso many guards. But this was his best lead on the godstones. If he let it go,\nthen… then what? The camp looked semipermanent. It would still be here\nin a week or two, and once the Blackhats were no longer on high alert\nMichel might get a chance to snoop around the upper archives with carte\nblanche. Hurrying now might betray his real purpose to Fidelis Jes.\nHe thumped on the roof of the cab. “Head back to the city,” he called.\n“Uh, sorry, sir,” the driver responded. “A man wants to speak to you.”"

He wore a dark yellow uniform with the bar\nand star of a major in the Fatrastan army on one shoulder, and a stitched\nwhite rose on the other; a soldier working with Blackhat authority.\nThe major did not look pleased. His broad face was expressionless, his\nmouth pressed into a firm line and his back as stiff as a board. “Out of the\ncab,” he said.\n“I think there’s been a misunderstanding,” Michel responded.\nThe major reached inside and grabbed Michel by the front of his shirt,\ndragging him out of the cab as he protested. Michel managed to keep his\nfeet, avoiding the indignity of falling in the mud, and soon found himself\nsurrounded by a whole platoon of the Landfall garrison. He swallowed,\nclosed his eyes, and let instinct kick in.\n“You curious about what’s going on here?” the major demanded,\npointing at the camp behind him. “Didn’t you see the signs? No stopping?\nThe newspapers were told to stay out.”\nMichel cleared his throat, letting an irritated expression blanket his face,\nand snapped, “Are you paranoid, Major?”\nThe major leaned forward slightly, the corner of his mouth lifting in a\nsneer. “Am I what?”\nSlowly, deliberately, Michel drew the Gold Rose from his shirt and let it\ndangle at the end of its chain. Somewhere in the back of the company\nsomeone muttered just a little too loudly, “The major messed up this time.”\nHe was quickly shushed.\n“Surprise inspection, Major,” Michel said, trying to sound as smug as\npossible.\nThe major somehow managed to straighten further, eyes snapping\nforward and hand coming up in a salute. “Sir!”\nMichel didn’t give the major any time to ask questions. He was in it\nnow, and he needed to move quickly enough that he was gone before\nanyone could figure out that maybe he wasn’t supposed to be here. He ran\nthrough a hundred questions in his head, trying to figure out how to ask\nwhat the pit this place was without looking like he didn’t actually know.\n“State your name.”\n“Major Cole, sir.”\n“Major Cole, would you kindly have your men escort me to the camp?”\n“Of course, sir. Fall in!”\nWithin moments Michel was squelching through the mud, wondering if\nhis shoes would be completely ruined and resisting the urge to look back at\nhis cab. This little excursion had either just gone very right, or very, very\nwrong.\nThey entered the camp through a guarded gap in the palisade. Convict\nlaborers milled everywhere. Some stood by the palisade, taking their lunch\nof gruel and bread, while others hid from the heat beneath sagging tents.\nThey stared at Michel with sunken, bleary eyes, and he wondered at the size\nof the workforce and the presence of the army for what appeared – from a\ndistance, at least – to be a midsize archeology dig."

I\nhope you’ll understand I was just doing my job.”\n“Which is?” Michel asked, trying to look like he didn’t actually care.\n“Make sure no one takes too much interest in the camp, sir.”\nMichel bit his tongue to keep from asking why and gave a gracious nod.\n“Thank you, Major, I’ll take your… zeal… into account on my report.” He\ngave one last glance around, noting the direction from which the laborers\nwere coming with their wheelbarrows and then stepping up to the door to\nthe building in front of him. The major seemed to expect that Michel\nwanted to end up here, so there was nothing to do but duck inside.\nHe found himself in what appeared to be a hastily built office barely\nbigger than a frontier tent. It was startlingly cool inside; a block of ice\npacked in sawdust was positioned in the corner of the room, while a pair of\nconvicts slowly fanned it to circulate the air. Most of the space was taken up\nby tables and chairs, covered in vast stacks of handwritten notes. Other than\nthe convicts, there was only a single occupant: a man bent over a table in\nthe center of the room, his attention so focused as he scribbled notes that he\ndidn’t even look up when Michel cleared his throat.\nMichel picked his way through the papers, trying to avoid stepping on\nanything important with his muddy shoes. The man seemed completely\noblivious to Michel’s presence. He stopped scribbling for a moment to\nscratch his balding scalp and mutter to himself, then went back to work.\nMichel bent over the nearest table, examining the notes.\nThey meant nothing to him. Equations, long rambling paragraphs,\ngeometry – there was even a star chart buried beneath a stack of reference\ncards. The notes appeared to be in at least four different handwritings, one\nof which looked awfully like the writing in the book where Michel had\nfound the lot number for this camp.\nHe’d never been to an archeological dig, but he’d always imagined\nthem far more orderly and severe – this looked like a professor’s desk had\njust exploded. He cleared his throat again, loudly, and the man finally\nlooked up, his eyes widening at the presence of another person in the room.\n“Good afternoon,” Michel said.\n“Who are you?”\nMichel pulled the Gold Rose out of his shirt and let it dangle for a\nmoment before returning it.\n“Ah.” The man nodded happily, as if Michel’s visit were as normal as\nthe heat. He crossed the room, snatching Michel’s hand and shaking it,\nleaving Michel’s fingers covered in ink smudges. “Professor Cressel. So\ngood to meet you. You’re here to review our work?” He gestured across the\nseemingly endless stacks of paper. “I’m afraid it’s a little unorganized, but I\ntell you this is all very exciting!”\n“Professor,” Michel said coolly, “I’m not here to review your work. Just\nthe, uh, excavation site.”"

    "text": "tell you this is all very exciting!”\n“Professor,” Michel said coolly, “I’m not here to review your work. Just\nthe, uh, excavation site.”\n“Of course, of course,” Cressel responded. “I’m afraid I’m not\nPrivileged Robson, but the Privileged was called back to the city rather\nsuddenly.” Cressel squinted at Michel curiously, then waved it off as if what\nwas going on back in Landfall was of no real consequence. “Things are\ngoing swimmingly here, however. The madness takes a few more people\nevery day, but the monolith is almost entirely unearthed. We’ve been\nprepping the move for weeks and should be ready within days.”\nMichel tried to wrap his head around all the information and mentally\nticked through what he knew: This was an archeological site of some kind;\nit was heavily guarded against outsiders; and something very important was\nlocated in the pit at the center of the camp. Michel’s mouth was suddenly\ndry as he considered the implications.\n“Where do you plan on moving it?” he asked faintly.\nCressel seemed surprised by the question. He tilted his head. “Dalinport,\nI believe. We need someplace better to conduct our experiments than the\nmiddle of farmland!” He scowled to himself, jotted a few things down on a\nscrap of paper, then smiled back at Michel.\nMichel slowly sidled toward the window on the far side of the room,\nmoving a box of papers out of his way before leaning to get a look outside.\nAbout fifty yards away, perfectly framed by two mounds of excavated\ndirt, was an immense pit. In the center rose an obelisk, perhaps twenty feet\nabove the ground and surrounded by scaffolding, with old men and women\nin suits clambering all over the face of it – taking impressions, writing\ndown notes, and sometimes standing and staring as if they’d been overcome\nby something unseen.\nMichel heard a whisper in the back of his head, like the sound of a\ncurtain being drawn aside, and turned toward Cressel. The professor seemed\noblivious, his nose back in his notes.\nMichel licked his lips, squinting at the obelisk. He heard the whisper\nagain, but ignored it. Was this the very godstone Taniel was looking for?\nFor some reason Michel had envisioned something… smaller – something\neasily moved, like the size of a bread box. He remembered that Taniel had\nused the plural when he spoke of the godstones.\n“Are there any others?” Michel asked.\nCressel looked up. “Hmm?”\n“Any other go – ” Michel caught himself. “Any other stones like this?”\n“I don’t believe so,” Cressel said, though he seemed immediately caught\nup in the idea. “Could you imagine, though? We’ve already learned so\nmuch from this one, if there were more…” He trailed off, fiddling with his\npencil, and turned back to his notes.\n“Imagine,” Michel murmured to himself, looking back out the window.\nThe whispering grew louder, and he was certain now he wasn’t imagining\nit. “Do you hear anything?”\n“Oh, that’s just the artifact. It talks sometimes.”\nEvery hair on the back of Michel’s neck stood up on end. He wanted to"

He wanted to\ngrab Cressel and shake him, demanding whether he really thought it was\nnormal for an inanimate object to talk. He leaned closer to the window,\npressing his nose against the glass, and stared. Whatever this thing was – it\ndid not seem friendly. He scratched at his arm, feeling like the whispers\nwere crawling beneath his skin.\n“The madness?” he asked.\n“Oh,” Cressel said, unconcerned, “it just takes the laborers. We keep our\nresearchers on a strict regimen. No more than two hours beside the\nmonolith at any time.”\nMichel’s eye twitched. This was not normal. Every sense screamed for\nhim to flee, to get away from this thing. He focused on the laborers moving\naround beside the pit and noted the harried, sleepless looks on their faces,\nthe wide-eyed stares. They felt it, too, but they had no choice but to work.\nHence, he decided, the army.\n“Would you like a tour of the excavation?” Cressel asked cheerfully.\n“No thank you.” Michel headed for the door. He had to tell Taniel about\nthis. And he had to get as far from it as possible if he was ever going to\nsleep again.\nCHAPTER 47\n“I\ndon’t know how you’re doing it,” Vlora said, “and I don’t want to\nknow. But I won’t talk to you while you’re wearing someone else’s\nface.”\nShe sat across from Tampo in the hackney cab, studying the unfamiliar\nface. This was Taniel; she knew it was. She should have known the moment\nthey talked last week in the Yellow Hall but that face was too different and\nstrange.\nOver the years she’d seen sorcery the likes of which most Privileged\ncould only dream, but she’d never witnessed anything like this. Her skin\ncrawled, stomach turning. She should have been able to sense a fellow\npowder mage. She should have been able to feel the sorcery that hid his\nface in the Else.\nShe could do neither.\n“Vlora,” Tampo began in a gentle, reprimanding tone of voice that she’d\nheard a thousand times when they were teenage lovers.\n“I’m serious,” she snapped, trying not to throw up.\nTampo snorted, turning toward the window. “This isn’t like putting on a\nmask,” he said. “It takes hours to put back.”\n“I don’t care.”\n“Damn it, Vlora…” Several moments passed before he finally put his\nface in his hands and drew them downward, like a man washing his face in\nthe basin first thing in the morning. When his fingers withdrew his face had\naltered, a series of subtle changes to his eyes, cheekbones, chin, and nose\nthat left him a different man; Taniel Two-shot, hero of the Fatrastan\nRevolution and Adran-Kez War. Godkiller.\nVlora opened the cab door and vomited onto the passing cobbles.\nShe straightened, wiping her mouth, the taste of bile on her tongue, then\nran a hand through her hair to find she was sweating horribly.

You’ve seen strange things before. Why does this\nbother you so much? She forced herself to examine Taniel closely,\nsearching his face. This was definitely him.\n“You haven’t aged,” she said.\n“A side effect of Ka-poel’s sorcery,” Taniel said.\nTaniel drew a pair of black gloves from his pocket and pulled them on\nover his fingers, drawing Vlora’s attention to his left hand. The hand must\nhave also been hidden behind this glamouring sorcery, because it was now\nsmooth and hairless, the skin the color of fresh blood. Vlora snorted, hardly\nallowing herself to be surprised. “You’re the Red Hand?” she asked.\nTaniel gave her a wan smile.\nWith all the strangeness Vlora had just witnessed, she found herself\nespecially drawn to the red skin. “How did that happen?”\nTaniel put his hands in his pocket, pulling a sour face. “Also a side\neffect of Ka-poel’s sorcery. I had a run-in with a very powerful Privileged.\nHe almost won. The kickback from Ka-poel’s protection turned him into a\nsmear of blood and dyed my skin red. No idea why.” He touched his elbow.\n“Goes all the way up to here.”\nVlora shook her head in wonder. Taniel Two-shot was both the Red\nHand and Gregious Tampo? A million questions went through her head, so\nmany different things she wanted to say that it made her dizzy. Yet when\nshe tried to speak, nothing important came out. “You’ve been busy.”\n“You could say that,” Taniel agreed.\n“So what? Are you immortal now?”\n“Not that I’d like to find out.” He pulled down the collar of his suit to\nshow a healed scar beneath his neck. “Getting shot still hurts.”\n“Glad to hear some things never change, even when you ascend to…\nwhatever it is you’ve become.”\nTaniel frowned, looking back out the window and not responding. She\ncould see the emotions leaping across his face, his lips twisting as he\nopened his mouth to speak, thought better of it, then tried to do so again\nwith the same results. Vlora wanted nothing more than to reach across the\nspace between them and punch him right between the eyes.\nShe managed to restrain herself. “You’re a son of a bitch, you know\nthat?” From the startled look on his face, that wasn’t exactly what he was\nexpecting her to say. She continued: “That shit you pulled on me in the\nYellow Hall. Yapping at me from behind another’s eyes about our past.\nTelling me that the Palo hated me because they loved you so much.”\n“None of that was a lie,” Taniel said.\n“That doesn’t make it any less of a shitty thing to bring up after ten\nyears.”\nTaniel rolled his tongue around in his cheek. “I’ll admit, there was some\nold anger there.”\n“Get over it,” Vlora said. “You’re supposed to be dead.

But I’ve been working for Lindet for over a year\nand a little warning would have been nice. I’ve been hunting the Red Hand.\nIt would have been nice to know it was you!”\n“You’ve been working for Lindet killing the people I’m trying to\nprotect.”\n“So I’m your enemy?”\nTaniel pursed his lips.\nVlora went on. “You’re a Palo now, then?”\n“My wife is.”\nVlora snorted. “Ka-poel – I assume you mean Ka-Poel – is Dynize. I\nremember that much. I’ve still got your letters. Been using them to navigate\nthis stupid place and…” She let out a sudden laugh, unable to help herself.\nThe irony of using Taniel’s letters to aid in her campaign against people he\nwas fighting for was just too much. She got herself under control, trying to\nget her mind to focus. A million questions, but only some of them were\ntruly important. “The Palo getting organized. All the grief and worry\nthey’ve been causing Lindet. That was you and Ka-poel?”\n“Most of it,” Taniel admitted. “And Pole considers herself Palo. She\nwas raised here, you know.”\n“If that was the two of you, why didn’t I run into more resistance when\nmy Riflejacks were putting down uprisings in the swamps? Even you could\norganize the rabble better than what we faced.”\nIf Taniel noticed the backhanded compliment, he did not acknowledge\nit. “By my count, there are over seven hundred Palo tribes stretched across\nthe whole of Fatrasta. Probably more that we don’t even know about.\nUniting them is a giant pain in the ass. We barely have a line of\ncommunication to those out in the Tristan Basin, let alone the wilds beyond\nthem.”\n“Just enough to get them riled up, eh?”\n“Not intentionally,” Taniel said.\nOne question down. “All right, so that wasn’t you out in the Basin. Then\nwhat the pit are you doing here? You say you’re protecting the Palo?\nUniting them? Why?”\n“To give them a fighting chance against the Kressian incursion.”\n“You are Kressian,” Vlora said. She could hear the anger in Taniel’s\nwords, and she felt her own rise to match it.\n“I’m dead, remember?” Taniel said. “Besides, the Palo need all the help\nthey can get. They’re not stupid. They’re not lacking in courage. They just\ndon’t have the training to stand up against Lindet.”\n“So you’re fomenting a revolution?”\nTaniel’s face twisted. “It’s more complicated than that.”\n“Indulge me.”\n“First of all, Lindet is brilliant, and I don’t use that word lightly. In\nterms of planning, she’s on par with my father.”\n“Everyone knows she’s smart,” Vlora conceded.\n“No. She’s brilliant. She has all of Field Marshal Tamas’s ability to plan\nand none of his moral qualms.”"

She has all of Field Marshal Tamas’s ability to plan\nand none of his moral qualms.”\n“Tamas had moral qualms?” Vlora asked, half-joking.\n“Compared to Lindet? Yes.”\n“You’re Taniel-bloody-Two-shot. Why don’t you just put a bullet in her\nhead and be done with it?”\n“That’s what makes this complicated,” Taniel said. “Lindet has\ncontingencies for everything, including powder mages. She’s accompanied\nby at least two Privileged at all times. Yes, I probably could kill her with\nKa-poel’s help, even though she’s also got contingencies against blood\nmagic. But this country is a tower of cards, and killing Lindet will make the\nentire thing fall down – she’s made certain of that.”\n“I thought you’re only worried about the Palo.”\nTaniel made a frustrated sound. “I’m worried about Fatrasta, both the\nPalo and the Kressians. The fates of everyone who lives here are tied\ntogether. I won’t cut off my nose to spite my face. Ka-poel and I have spent\nthe last five years trying to figure out how to remove Lindet from power\nand the best we’ve come up with is outright revolution.”\n“And here I thought you were trying a peaceful route,” Vlora said\nsarcastically. She wasn’t sure what to make of this – any of it – but she\ndidn’t like it. It seemed almost funny that ten years ago she would have\nbeen on board with a coup in a heartbeat. She would have been idealistic,\nhopeful, determined – just like Taniel sounded. She was the one who’d\nchanged, not him. No, not funny, she decided. Terrifying.\n“I am,” Taniel insisted. “Mostly. Uniting the Palo is the first step to a\npeaceful revolution. Our goal is to force Lindet into a corner. I’ve studied\nher moves for the last twelve years and I readily admit she’s smarter than\nme. But I’m not an idiot, either. I can see patterns. Everything she does is\nfor Fatrasta. Not the people, or the country, but the concept. She wants this\ncountry to work and so far it’s done so by her will alone. If the whole of\nFatrasta turns against her, she will abdicate.”\nVlora was not convinced. Something was bothering her about this\nwhole exchange, and she couldn’t quite figure out what. “Was Mama Palo\none of yours?” she asked.\n“She was,” Taniel said.\n“You let her die.”\nTaniel’s eyes tightened. “Technically, you killed her.” He paused,\nblowing out softly through his nostrils. “I did not see you coming. Four\npowder mages accompanied by a Palo guide, right into the center of the\nDepths? That was ballsy, even for you. I would have stopped you if I had\nknown it was coming.”\n“You could have rescued her from the gallows.”\n“To what end?” Taniel asked.\n“To save an old lady’s life! To rescue the one person who’s been uniting\nthe Palo against Lindet! To stop the Blackhats from having another victory."

To stop the Blackhats from having another victory.\nTo…” Vlora trailed off, suddenly angry with Taniel for his lack of action,\nand angry with herself for being complicit in Mama Palo’s death. Taniel\ntilted his head to one side, and Vlora narrowed her eyes. “What?”\n“The old woman who died wasn’t Mama Palo.”\nVlora opened her mouth, then closed it again. “You… son of a bitch, it’s\nKa-poel, isn’t it?”\n“Of course it is. The old woman who went to the gallows was named\nCherin-tes. She’s been a figurehead from the very beginning, and she knew\nit. And before you call me a monster for letting her die, a sickness in her\nblood would have seen her dead within the year anyway. She knew the\nrisks.”\n“And Mama Palo?”\n“It’ll take Lindet a couple of months, but she’ll eventually figure out\nthat she missed.”\n“That I missed,” Vlora corrected.\n“Yup.”\nVlora scowled. She didn’t like the idea of leaving town and having\nrumors spread over the winter that she’d botched a job. It would be terrible\nfor the Riflejacks’ reputation. The intangible thing in the back of her mind\nwas still bugging her. It was floating just outside her awareness, like a moth\ntapping against a windowpane. Suddenly, she reached out and snagged it.\n“The Dynize,” she said. “Meln-Dun. The dragonmen. What’s the\nconnection?”\nFor the first time since their cab ride began, Taniel’s face went stony, his\neyes narrowing. “That’s something entirely different,” he said quietly.\n“Is it a problem for you?”\n“The Dynize are clever. They’ve been very subtle about their infiltration\nof the Depths. We’ve been watching them, keeping our distance, but if I’ve\nput the pieces together right, and Meln-Dun tricked you into helping him\nremove Mama Palo…”\n“He did,” Vlora growled.\n“… and Meln-Dun has some sort of deal with the Dynize…”\n“Seems little doubt of that,” Vlora interjected.\n“… then Ka-poel and I are going to move against them soon.”\nVlora did not envy the Dynize who would be caught up in that purge.\nShe knew what Ka-poel was capable of when she was angry, and if the\nsorcery disguising Taniel was any indication, she’d progressed even further\nsince then. “Why are they here?” Vlora asked.\n“We don’t know.”\n“You don’t know, or you won’t tell me?”\n“Both. We have our suspicions, but…”\nVlora waited for him to finish the sentence. He didn’t. “You don’t trust\nme,” she finally said.\n“You’re working for Lindet.”\n“You just told me a lot more damning information than a few suspicions\nover Dynize spies.”\n“Compared to our suspicions, all of this is inconsequential. Besides,\nnothing I told you could help you fight us. The Blackhats have been trying\nto catch the Red Hand for years. The only way I survive is by making"

The only way I survive is by making\ncertain there’s nothing to capture.”\n“Taniel Red Hand, huh?”\n“Just Red Hand. Taniel’s dead, remember?”\nVlora found herself troubled, wondering what suspicions Taniel could\nhave about the Dynize that were even more sensitive than his war with\nLindet. “The Riflejacks don’t work for Lindet anymore.”\nTaniel’s eyebrows rose. “Is that so?”\n“We handed over Mama Palo. That was our job. I refused further\nemployment.”\n“I’m glad to hear that,” Taniel said, sounding genuine.\nVlora waited for a few moments, then said, “What are your suspicions?”\nTaniel gave her a tight smile. “How would you like a job?”\nThe question shouldn’t have taken Vlora off guard, but it did. She reeled\nmentally, taking a deep breath and leaning back in her seat to get her wits\nabout her. She’d made up her mind to leave Fatrasta, maybe forever, and\nshe was ready to board a ship by the end of the week. “What kind of a job?”\n“I’m not sure yet. I might need an army sometime in the next couple of\nyears. I could put you and the Riflejacks on retainer and have you wait\naround up north. Could come in handy.”\nIt sounded like a mercenary’s dream job. Be paid to wait around for\npending orders. They wouldn’t have to keep up appearances, manage a\ngarrison, or anything. Her men wouldn’t like the prospect of staying away\nfrom home for another two years – but they’d love the freedom of\nterrorizing the brothels and pubs of northern Fatrasta on someone else’s\nkrana.\n“We’re planning on heading home,” Vlora said. She could hear the\nhesitance in her own voice, and Taniel pounced on it.\n“I’ll pay you whatever Lindet was paying you.”\n“You’ve got money?”\n“Remember how we agreed to split the inheritance after the war? You\ngot the domestic holdings, I got the foreign ones?”\n“Yes,” Vlora said slowly. She could have kept it all if she wanted.\nDespite their falling-out during the war, she was still Field Marshal Tamas’s\nadopted daughter – and Taniel was technically dead. Legally, everything\nTamas had before his death belonged to her.\n“Did you ever bother to check those accounts?” Taniel asked.\n“Not that I recall.”\n“Tamas was fabulously wealthy. He was the king’s favorite for most of\nhis life and didn’t so much as buy himself a drink if he didn’t have to. His\nforeign holdings could have bought him a sultanate in Gurla.”\n“Wish I’d known that before I became a damned mercenary\ncommander,” Vlora muttered. She ran through the logistics in her head,\nalready drifting toward the problem of keeping her men sharp while on a\nsort of permanent leave, and avoiding Lindet’s questions. Northern Fatrasta\nmight be like a whole different country, but it was still ruled by Lindet. But\nthere was one thing stopping her. “I can’t,” she finally said.\nTaniel had the temerity to look hurt. “Why not?”"

I’ve seen the outcome of good intentions, and I’m not going to put\neither myself or my soldiers through any of it.”\nTaniel frowned, looking pensively at his gloved hands for some time.\n“Are you sure?”\n“I’m sure.”\nThe two of them sat in silence, eyes locked, studying each other. Vlora\nwondered what he was hiding – what he wasn’t telling her. What did he\nknow about the Dynize and the Palo and Lindet? What were his plans?\nTaniel had never been ambitious, and beyond the defense of Adro she had\nnever witnessed him involved in a cause to which he was truly committed.\nTo what lengths would he go to reach his goals? More important, what were\nKa-poel’s goals and motives in all of this?\nA dozen more questions sat on the tip of her tongue, and a dozen times\nas many fears. Taniel was unreadable, but at least Vlora had once known\nhim intimately; she might be able to foresee his intentions. Ka-poel was the\ntruly terrifying one of the pair – both for her power, and her\nunpredictability.\nWhy were they here, struggling on behalf of a people who could not\nwin a fight they did not want? Vlora guessed that the answer was in the\nquestion, that he and Ka-poel were the Palo’s only hope. But was there\nsomething more?\nVlora realized suddenly that they hadn’t moved for several minutes. Her\nthroat went dry at the thought, her first instinct to be wary of ambush. “I’d\nlike to return to the fort now.”\nTaniel gave a sad nod and thumped on the roof of the cab. “Loel’s Fort,”\nhe commanded.\n“Won’t be going anywhere for a while, sir,” the driver responded.\n“Traffic’s all backed up.”\nVlora stuck her head out the window, looking up and down the street\nand a long line of cabs, carriages, and wagons. Drivers were shouting at one\nanother, some standing up in their seats to try to see what the holdup was.\nUrchins darted among the wheels, taking the opportunity to snatch goods\nout of the back of wagons before retreating to nearby alleyways.\n“What’s going on?” she asked.\n“Not sure, ma’am,” the driver said.\nVlora chewed on her bottom lip, reassuring herself that this was a\ncoincidence. It had nothing to do with her or Taniel. It wasn’t a trap of some\nkind. Her nerves were just strung too tightly. “Where are we?”\n“Eastern lip, ma’am. Right above the bay.”\nMore than two miles’ walk back to Loel’s Fort, and the heat of the\nafternoon was getting worse.\n“I’ll see what’s going on,” Taniel said, getting out of the cab. Vlora got\nout after him, paying the driver before running to catch up.\n“I’m heading back to my men,” she told him. “Olem will need help"

You never really realize the logistics\nof moving a whole brigade until you’re actually in command.”\n“Tamas loved that sort of stuff,” Taniel said wistfully. He tapped his\ncane on the cobbles, frowning up at the rooftops as they wound their way\nthrough the crowd. A stiff breeze came in off the ocean, nearly taking\nVlora’s hat off. Taniel suddenly stopped and turned to her. “I’m not your\nenemy,” he said.\n“And I’m not yours.” They stared at each other once again. They might\nnot be enemies, Vlora thought to herself, but she couldn’t exactly call them\nfriends.\n“I’m glad. Does Olem know I’m still alive?”\n“He does.”\n“Tell him hello for me. Consult with him, if you’re willing. Reconsider\nmy offer.”\nVlora bit her tongue. She knew that Olem would agree with whatever\ndecision she wound up making. But as much as he hated ships and wouldn’t\nbe looking forward to the voyage home, he had to be aching to see the Nine\nagain. “I’ll talk to him.”\n“Thank you,” Taniel said. He smiled to himself. “You know, sometimes\nI wish I had remained alive. That I’d just retired quietly and gone out into\nthe world. That I could have stayed myself – I could have come back and\nvisited, and Ka-poel and I could have taken dinner with you and Olem at a\ndockside club in Adro. I wish I could have lived a normal life.”\n“I don’t think either of us would have been able to handle a normal\nlife,” Vlora responded.\n“No. Probably not. I…” Taniel trailed off.\nThey’d continued walking, albeit slowly, as they spoke, and the eastern\nedge of the Landfall Plateau had come into view. A crowd had gathered in\nthe street, all of them pointing and talking excitedly, looking at something\ndown in the docks below.\nNo, Vlora realized. Not the docks. Farther out, beyond the edge of the\nbay. She pushed her way to the front of the crowd, craning her neck to see.\nThere was a ship out there, easily half a mile from the shore. It was\nimmense, a ship of the line with three decks of guns on either side and a\nforecastle that would have rivaled a tenement in height. The gray sails were\ndrawn, and even at this distance she could make out tiny figures scrambling\naround the deck.\n“Why are they stopped so far out?” she asked.\n“Look at the flag,” Taniel said flatly, stepping up to her side.\n“What about it?” Vlora lifted her eyes, and it took a moment for the\nwind to catch the flag above the ship’s highest sail, unraveling to reveal a\nblack background with a cluster of red stars arcing across the center. “Oh,”\nshe whispered.\nThat flag did not belong to Adro or Kez or Brudania, or any of the\ncountries of the Nine. It wasn’t the emblem of a Gurlish province or any\ncolonial power on the world.\nIt was the flag of the Dynize Empire."

She rubbed her nose and\nreturned the rest of the charge to her breast pocket. Within moments her\nsenses had sharpened, and she was able to pick out the details of the\nindividuals on board the ship as if they were a few feet away. Men and\nwomen scurried across the decks, preparing longboats for lowering. It was\nstrange to see a ship entirely manned by people with the red hair and ashen\nfreckles of the Palo, and she had to remind herself that they weren’t actually\nFatrastan natives.\n“What am I looking for?” she asked.\n“The horizon.”\nVlora lifted her gaze, and what she saw took her breath away. Far out\nbeyond the closest ship, miles and miles from shore where even the best\nlooking glasses would have trouble spotting them at the edge of the horizon,\nshe could see more ships. There were dozens of them, perhaps forty or\nmore, and each was capped by a tiny black and red dot that could only be\nthe Dynize flag.\n“Since when do the Dynize leave their home country?” someone beside\nher asked.\nVlora wet her lips and turned to Taniel, speaking in a low voice. “Since\nwhen do the Dynize have a fleet?”\n“They don’t,” Taniel said, dumbfounded. “They shouldn’t. This changes\neverything.”\nVlora was running in a moment, not even bothering to hail a cab as she\nsprinted down the street, ignoring the shouts that followed her as with\npowder-enhanced speed she blew past people. She had to get back to the\nRiflejacks and Olem.\nTaniel was right. This changed everything.\nCHAPTER 48\nS\ntyke sat in one corner of Lady Flint’s office in Loel’s Fort, his borrowed\nknife in his lap, rocking on the back two legs of the chair, his face\npointed at the ceiling and his eyes closed as he waited for Lady Flint to\nreturn from Mama Palo’s execution. Across from him Ibana paced\nrestlessly, thumbs hooked through her belt loops, repeating the same phrase\nevery five minutes or so.\n“This is a terrible idea.”\n“You mentioned that,” Styke answered.\n“Well, I’m mentioning it again. Couldn’t you have just sent her a\ndamned letter or something?”\nStyke opened his eyes and kept them glued to the sagging plaster\nceiling, listening to the chair beneath him creak in protest as he rocked\nhimself gently with one foot. “I could have,” he said. “But I didn’t.”\n“I hadn’t noticed,” Ibana responded sarcastically.\nStyke sucked in a mouthful of air, puffed out his cheeks, and slowly\nblew it back out. Ibana was right, of course. This was a terrible idea. Olem\nhad told him before his fight with Fidelis Jes that he was no longer\nwelcome here, and that the men had been ordered to arrest him on sight."

He should have left Ibana with the other lancers. “Look,” he\nsaid, “if you want me back, if you want me to take command of the Mad\nLancers, then I’m going to set a few things to rest first.”\nTwo things, to be precise. The first he’d taken care of not long after his\nconversation with Lindet by leaving a note for Tampo at the only address\nthe lawyer had given him – a bank box on the western edge of the plateau.\nThis was the second thing, and for some reason he’d decided it was far\nmore important. He’d also, stupidly, decided to do it in person.\nIbana was about to respond, an argumentative look on her face, when\nStyke heard a commotion in the muster yard outside. They both froze, and\nStyke slowly lowered the front legs of his chair to the ground and got up,\nborrowed knife in hand.\n“Where’s Olem!” Lady Flint’s voice demanded from somewhere\noutside.\nStyke couldn’t hear the answer, or make out Flint’s barked order, but he\ncould tell she was heading in his direction. He braced himself and gestured\nIbana away from the door.\nLady Flint opened it a moment later, stepping inside while shouting\nover her shoulder, “Get everyone. Send a messenger to Fidelis Jes and\nLindet telling them I want to see them.”\n“Which one?” someone asked.\n“Either. Both. I don’t care. I – ” Flint cut herself off, pausing just inside\nthe door at the sight of Ibana, eyes falling on Styke half a second later. Her\npistol seemed to leap into her hand, and a shout on the tip of her tongue was\narrested only by Styke barking one word:\n“Wait!”\nStyke stared down the barrel of Flint’s pistol for an agonizing ten\nseconds, Ibana coiled as if ready to spring, hoping the whole time that\nnobody did anything rash. Slowly, bit by bit, Flint’s finger came off the\ntrigger. “What are you doing here?” she asked.\n“We came to talk,” Styke said, gesturing for Ibana to relax.\n“Everyone wants to talk with me right now. It’s getting bloody well old.\nHow did you get in here?”\n“Olem let us in.”\nVlora whispered a litany of curses before finally lowering her pistol. “I\nstill may shoot you. Who’s this?”\nNot a great start, Styke decided, but it was better than getting a bullet\nthrough the eye. “This is my second in command, Ibana ja Fles.”\n“The swordmaker?”\n“That’s right,” Ibana said.\n“I have one of your knives,” Flint said. “It’s some damn fine work. Pit,\nyou’re tall. Damn it, Styke, I thought I only had to deal with one giant.”\nIbana pursed her lips, but her shoulders relaxed and Styke gave a silent sigh\nof relief.

Nothing like a little flattery to help cool the air. “Okay,” Flint said,\n“if Olem let you in here he must think it’s important. I’m a bit busy, so you\nhave thirty seconds.”\nStyke took a deep breath, wondering why some words were so much\neasier to say than others. He chewed on them for a moment, glanced at\nIbana – whose impatient look was no help at all – then said, “I came to\napologize.”\n“For tricking me into hiring a convict and making me look like a fool in\nfront of my employers?”\n“No. Not for that.”\nFlint blinked. That wasn’t what she’d been expecting. She closed the\ndoor behind her warily, putting her back to it, still holding her pistol. She\nwas such a small thing, nearly two feet shorter than either him or Ibana. Her\nblocking the exit might have made him laugh if he didn’t know what she\nwas capable of. “Then what?” she asked flatly.\n“You hired me under false pretenses,” Styke said. “But not the ones you\nthink. I did not escape from Sweetwallow like Jes told you. I was released.”\nHe’d considered long and hard what he wanted to tell Flint, and why. He’d\ndecided that, while he owed Tampo his freedom, he owed Lady Flint his\npride. After ten years in the camps, the latter was not something he’d ever\nthought to see again.\n“I’m listening,” Flint said.\n“I was released from the camps by a lawyer named Gregious Tampo. He\nbribed the parole board, and as a condition for my freedom sent me to work\nfor you. He wanted me to keep you out of trouble until he didn’t need you\nanymore, and then kill you.”\nTo Styke’s surprise, Flint’s face began to change the moment Styke\nmentioned Tampo’s name. Her mouth dropped, then her brows lowered into\na scowl, and then she threw her head back and let out an angry sigh. It was\nnot the reaction Styke was expecting.\nFlint scratched her head with the barrel of her pistol and then\nbrandished it at Styke. “Did he actually tell you he wanted me dead?”\nStyke looked at her askance. She was taking this awfully well for\nsomeone whose trust had been betrayed. “No,” he said. “But that was\nobviously the end goal. He needs you for something. I never got the order\nto cut your throat, so I assume he still does. I’m here to warn you.”\n“Duly noted,” Flint said.\n“That’s all there is,” Styke said, getting to his feet and putting his knife\naway. “I thought you should know.” He felt strange. Pleasant, but strange.\nHe wasn’t used to giving excuses or explaining himself to anyone. In his\nold life he’d never had to, and in the camps no one cared. The same went\nwith apologizing. “You said you’re busy, so we’ll go now.”\nFlint’s pistol came back up, wavering from Styke to Ibana. Styke\ntensed, glancing at Ibana, whose hand had gone to the sword at her hip.\n“Neither of you is going anywhere,” Flint said."

I came in\ngood faith.”\n“I never offered any good faith,” Flint snapped. “And if you think I’m\nnot pissed as pit that I took a spy into my midst, you’re dead wrong. But\nI’m not looking for a fight, either.” She lowered her pistol, her mouth\ntightening into a straight line. “I respect the fact you came back. I should\ncut you to ribbons, but I’m not going to, and here’s why: Tampo doesn’t\nwant me dead.”\nStyke exchanged a glance with Ibana. “How do you know?”\n“Because Gregious Tampo isn’t Gregious Tampo. He’s a powder mage\nby the name of Taniel Two-shot, and he’s been playing everyone in this\ndamned city for fools.”\n“Uh,” was all Styke could manage. He tried to wrap his mind around\nthis information. Styke’s memory wasn’t great, but he’d fought beside\nTaniel during the war. Gregious Tampo was definitely not Taniel. “Two-shot\nis dead. You said so yourself.”\n“Taniel faked his death at the end of the Adran-Kez War,” Flint replied.\nShe finally stuffed her pistol into her belt, taking a small sniff of powder,\nremoving the tremor from her voice. “He and the bone-eye you met back\nduring the Fatrastan Revolution are here, now.”\nStyke scowled, licking his lips, thinking back over the meetings he’d\nhad with Tampo. “No,” he said. “I would have sensed it. My Knack can\nsmell sorcery.”\n“Ka-poel’s sorcery is stronger than anything you’ve ever encountered,”\nFlint said, sounding almost resigned to the fact. “It fooled your Knack and it\nfooled my third eye. It’s fooled a damn lot of people, but Tampo – or rather,\nTaniel – doesn’t want me dead. If he sent you here to keep me out of trouble\nhe probably thought he was protecting me.”\nThis was a lot to take in. Ibana looked skeptical, and Styke himself\nechoed the sentiment. It was possible to hide from the Else using Privileged\nsorcery, but it was incredibly difficult. Wearing someone else’s face for long\nperiods of time, and being completely undetectable? It would take a whole\nPrivileged cabal to manage that.\nOr, if Flint was telling the truth, a single powerful bone-eye.\nStyke could think of no reason for Flint to lie. “So does this mean no\nhard feelings?” he asked slowly.\n“I wouldn’t go that far,” Flint said, eyes flashing. “But a secret\nbodyguard is more palatable than a secret assassin.” Her eyes suddenly\nwidened. “Son of a bitch, I don’t have time for this.” She opened the door\nand yelled for Olem, then closed it behind her, eyes focusing on Styke. “Did\nyou fight Fidelis Jes?”\n“I did.” Styke grimaced.\n“And you lost?”\n“He sent me back to the camps, crippled.”"

    "text": "you fight Fidelis Jes?”\n“I did.” Styke grimaced.\n“And you lost?”\n“He sent me back to the camps, crippled.”\nFlint looked him up and down. “You don’t look crippled.”\n“The Mad Lancers rescued him,” Ibana explained. “We may have, um,\nkidnapped a Privileged to heal his wounds.”\n“Kidnapped a Privileged…” Flint muttered. She shook her head.\n“Bloody madmen. Okay, so that is where we stand. Did you find anything\nelse out about the Dynize before that whole debacle?”\nStyke shook his head. He could see in her eyes that Flint had moved\npast the apology, the revealed betrayal, and all of that to something else.\nHer ability to compartmentalize was admirable, but he reminded himself\nnot to make the mistake of assuming she would trust him again.\n“So you know nothing about the Dynize fleet sitting out beyond the\nbay?” Flint asked.\n“The what now?” Ibana asked, mouth falling open.\nStyke managed to keep the shock off his face, but he felt like he’d been\npunched in the gut. “That’s not possible,” he said.\n“Neither is Taniel Two-shot being alive,” Flint responded. “But there it\nis. At least forty ships of war and I have no idea how many support\nfrigates.”\n“The Dynize haven’t left their country for over a hundred years.”\n“Tell me something I don’t know.”\n“How do they even have a fleet?” Ibana demanded.\n“I’d love to figure that out,” Flint said, “but in the meantime I’d rather\nknow why they’re here.”\nThere was a knock on the door and Styke jumped, only then realizing\nhe’d been clutching the handle of his knife. Olem poked his head inside.\n“Vlora,” he started, then saw Styke and Ibana. “Ah. You’re still here.”\n“Yes, they’re still here,” Flint responded, acid in her voice. “And you\nand I are going to talk about this later.”\n“Sure,” Olem said coolly. “After we talk about Fidelis Jes standing in\nthe muster yard.”\nStyke was halfway to the door before he even knew he was moving.\nFlint threw out a hand, putting a surprisingly firm palm on his chest. “No,”\nshe barked.\nStyke clenched and unclenched his fists. This was his chance. He was\nhealed, fresh, angry, armed. He didn’t care how many Blackhats Jes had\nwith him out there, between him and Ibana they would carve through the lot\nand he’d pop Jes’s eyeballs like pimples. He tried to step forward, but Ibana\nput an arm around his chest and hauled him back. He growled at her, and\nshe slapped him across the face. It was enough for him to get control of\nhimself, and he stalked to the other end of the room and glared at both\nIbana and Flint.\n“What does he want?” Flint asked. “Is it about the fleet?”\n“It is,” Olem answered.\nFlint seemed to vacillate before pointing at Styke. “You, stay here. If\nyou so much as put a finger outside this door I will put a bullet in your\nhead. Olem, let Jes in the building.”"

Olem, let Jes in the building.”\nShe disappeared, leaving Styke and Ibana alone inside her office once\nmore. Styke took several deep breaths, letting himself calm down before\nshrugging Ibana’s hold off his shoulders. “I’m fine,” he said quietly. He’d\nimagined a quick apology and a quicker exit, and now he was stuck here\nwith his worst enemy on the other side of the door. He should have had a\nbetter exit strategy. Slowly, he crept over and put his ear against the door.\nIn the next room, he heard Fidelis Jes enter and a cold exchange of\npleasantries between the two.\n“What’s going on?” Ibana whispered, joining him.\nStyke listened carefully, only catching about half of the muffled\nconversation. “Jes is telling Flint about the fleet. Seems he wants to hire\nher.”\n“She’s not working for him anymore?”\n“No. That’s what Lindet said. Their contract was for Mama Palo.”\nIbana snorted. “You got lucky then. If she was still with him she would\nhave handed us over. Or tried to.”\n“I don’t think she would have,” Styke answered. He shushed her, trying\nto catch more of the exchange, but to no avail. “What are we going to do\nabout this?”\n“About what? Jes?” Ibana asked. “We’re going to kill him and use his\nskin to make you a new saddle.”\nStyke rolled his eyes. “And people say I have anger problems. No,\nabout the Dynize.”\n“Sod the Dynize. We’re riding against the Blackhats.”\nStyke stepped away from the door, taking Ibana by the arm and pulling\nher into the far corner, where they were less likely to be overheard. “If it’s\ntrue, and there’s a Dynize fleet out there, something is happening far bigger\nthan you or I or the Mad Lancers.” He remembered Lindet’s warning to\nwatch the horizon. Had she known this was coming?\nIbana lifted her face away from his, looking down her nose. “What are\nyou thinking?”\n“I’m thinking that we should lie low for a few months. See what\nhappens. It may be that the Mad Lancers have more important things to do\nthan slaughter Blackhats.”\n“You’re going to let them get away with what they did to you?” Ibana\nhissed.\n“Pit, no. I still want that saddle you promised me. But I formed the Mad\nLancers to protect Fatrasta, not to avenge my own losses.”\n“You did it for both.”\nStyke chewed on the inside of his cheek. “Fair point. But something is\nhappening.” He paused, a thought occurring to him. He replayed the\nconversation with Lindet last night through his head. “Pit,” he said\nbreathlessly. “Lindet must have known they were coming.”\n“How?” Ibana asked.\n“She told me to watch the horizon. She said Fatrasta would face its\ngreatest threat and that she didn’t think we would be prepared for it. I\nthought she was trying to throw me off the trail, but she was talking about"

I\nthought she was trying to throw me off the trail, but she was talking about\nthe Dynize.” He was certain of it now, and he silently cursed Lindet for it.\n“Damn it, she could have just bloody well told me.”\n“If she knew, why didn’t she say anything?”\n“She didn’t think I needed to know,” Styke said bitterly. “You know that\nI’m the only person in the world who knows her birthday? If it’s not\npertinent, she doesn’t share it. Just some bloody cryptic warnings. I – ”\nHis next sentence was cut off by the door swinging open. Styke\nsnatched for his knife, but it was just Lady Flint. She was wearing a scowl,\nlooking like she’d aged five years in the time since she left the room. “Is Jes\ngone?” Styke asked.\n“Yes.”\n“What did he want?” Ibana demanded.\nFlint crossed between them, rounding her desk and plopping down into\na chair. Olem entered the room a moment later, taking up a spot just inside.\nNeither looked happy.\nFinally, Flint said, “I need you and your Mad Lancers.”\n“Excuse me?” Ibana did not sound pleased.\nFlint’s tone was distant. “We’ll outfit you with horses and kit. I want\nyou riding north within the hour. We’ve got eight hundred cuirassiers and\nthree hundred dragoons stationed in Jedwar. You’re to take command of\nthem and bring them back to the city.”\nStyke’s chest was suddenly tight. “Why?”\n“Because,” Flint said, “I’ve just been deputized as a general in the\nFatrastan army. That fleet outside is making Lindet twitchy. I’ve been given\ncomplete control over the garrison and defenses of Landfall.”\n“Is there going to be violence?”\n“We don’t know. Lindet isn’t taking any chances, and I’m the best\nthey’ve got.”\n“What about Jes?” Styke asked.\nFlint’s head turned, her eyes focusing on Styke with a single-minded\ndetermination that made him take half a step back. “You and the Blackhats\nare going to put aside your squabble until the danger outside has passed.”\n“Like pit we will.” Ibana snorted.\n“Like pit. You will,” Flint ordered.\nIbana scowled back at her, then said in a slightly chastised tone, “It’s Jes\nyou have to worry about.”\nStyke glanced between the two women, wondering if this would still\ncome to blows. He’d never heard anyone speak to Ibana that way and live\nto tell the tale. But Ibana was still listening, so that was a good sign.\n“Jes will stay the bloody pit out of my way while I am in command,”\nFlint said, “or I’ll put him in front of a firing squad before Lindet can so\nmuch as sneeze. You two can either follow my orders or get out of my\noffice. I have real work to do.”\nStyke glanced at Ibana, then down at his own hands.

And put aside\na decade of hatred.\nTen years since he last sat in a saddle. His balls were going to be so\ndamned sore by the end of the night. “We’ll leave at once,” he said.\nFlint nodded as if their joining her was a foregone conclusion. “Good.\nMajor Fles. Colonel Styke. Welcome to the Riflejacks. Now go pick up the\nrest of your command.”\nCHAPTER 49\n“W\nhat’s her name?”\nStyke stood beside a dirt path in the center of a small town in the\nmarshes north of Landfall, slowly stroking his thumb along the nose of the\nhorse at his side. His attention was drawn to the south, head raised to watch\nfor anyone heading this way from the city. Celine sat in the saddle astride\nthe horse, gently running her fingers through his mane.\n“She is a he,” Styke said, glancing over his shoulder at Celine. She\nnodded at the correction, as if she’d been right all along. “He’s a gelding,\nand I haven’t named him yet.”\n“What kind is he?”\nStyke glanced sidelong at the horse, continuing to run his thumb down\nthe center of his nose. “Mix-breed. He’s definitely a Brudanian draft horse,\nbut…” He considered it a moment, running his hand down the length of the\nhorse’s back, enjoying the coarse feel of hair beneath his fingers. It had\nbeen too long since he’d last ridden. He’d squeezed the reins so hard they\nhad left an impression on his palm, and his inner thighs chafed like a bitch\nafter just a couple of miles. But they were both good kinds of hurts.\nPain that reminded him he was a free man.\n“His hindquarters are a bit sleeker than a regular draft horse,” he said.\n“Look at the coloring. The black with a little brown mottle on the neck,\nwith the white on his rump, is pretty rare. You find that on Gurlish racing\nhorses.”\n“My dad bet on a Gurlish racing horse once,” Celine said.\n“How did that go?”\n“Lost a few hundred krana. Said betting was for fools and threw his hat\nin the Hadshaw.”\nStyke snorted. “Everyone has to learn sometime.” He ran his hand down\nthe horse’s neck again, enjoying the feel. Lady Flint’s stablemaster said this\nwas the biggest beast he had, and about the orneriest, but after a little heart-\nto-heart in the stables Styke felt like they had come to an understanding. He\nwasn’t as big as Deshner, nor as strong, but he had some spirit. “Do you\nwant to name him?”\n“How about Precious?” Celine said.\n“Absolutely not.”\n“Juggernaut!”\n“Where the pit did you learn a word like that?”\n“From…”\n“Your dad,” Styke finished for her. “Right, right. Regular ol’ genius,\nwasn’t he? How about we call him Amrec.”\n“Amrec is a boy’s name.”\n“And Amrec is a boy.” Styke leaned back to look at the gelding’s"

    "text": "wasn’t he? How about we call him Amrec.”\n“Amrec is a boy’s name.”\n“And Amrec is a boy.” Styke leaned back to look at the gelding’s\nhindquarters. “Or at least he used to be.” He patted Amrec on the nose,\nfishing in his pocket for a carrot he’d grabbed from a merchant as he left\ntown. “You like that, Amrec?” Amrec nearly took his fingers off taking the\ncarrot, and Styke jerked down on the bridle gently. “None of that, hear me?”\nHe turned away from Celine and Amrec, looking back toward Landfall.\nThey were a couple of miles out, and the plateau rose above the floodplains,\nhazy in the afternoon heat, while flies buzzed quietly around Amrec’s\nswishing tail. Styke had picked one of the few rises in this area so he had a\npretty good view of the road. He waited, watching, wondering.\nIbana had gone to tell the Mad Lancers that they had a new command,\nand that they wouldn’t be tearing up the Blackhats – at least, not just yet. A\nlittle voice in the back of Styke’s head whispered that he no longer had it.\nThat the lancers would give up in anger and go home; that they weren’t\ninterested in his command, and just wanted to go out for blood.\nHe wouldn’t blame them if they did. The Blackhats hadn’t just beaten\nhim; they’d broken the homes and businesses and, in some cases, bones of\nalmost all the Mad Lancers veterans. Styke’s body and the bones had been\nmended by Privileged sorcery. The rest was gone – ten years of trying to\nmake something out of themselves, all down the drain because Styke had\ndared to leave the labor camp.\nHe wondered, if he’d known what he would ruin for the rest of them,\nwhether he would have taken Tampo’s offer.\nYes, he decided. He definitely would have. “No one else’s suffering is\never as acute as your own,” he muttered.\n“What?” Celine asked.\n“Nothing. Here.” He reached in his pocket for his last carrot. “Feed this\nto Amrec. Talk to him.”\n“Will it make us friends?”\n“Food, in my experience, is one of the few things that can cement a\ngood friendship between strangers.”\nHe watched a small group of riders leave the Landfall suburbs and head\nnorth along his path. He waited until he could clearly make them out as\nBlackhats before he took Amrec by the reins and led him around to the far\nside of the little village, hoping the patrol would pass through without\nstopping.\nIf the rest of the lancers backed out, would Ibana still follow him? She\nstill seemed like her old self. But ten years was a long time, and she’d been\nfurious after they left Lady Flint’s. She’d cursed and yelled before storming\noff, and only a shout over her shoulder had given him any indication of\nwhere to expect her and the rest of the lancers to join him.\nAnd now he was here. He had a girl, a horse, and the hope that a bunch\nof rowdy old veterans still thought of him as good enough to follow. By the\nposition of the sun it was past seven in the evening.

As it was, they’d have to ride well into the night to\nreach Jedwar and collect Flint’s cavalry.\nHe kicked at a clump of dirt glumly, then put a hand on Amrec’s flank –\nmore to calm himself than the horse. Amrec suddenly stirred, snorting, and\nStyke reached for his knife and looked toward movement at the corner of\nhis vision.\nHe let himself relax. It was just a Palo woman.\nShe was less than five feet tall, a slight thing with fiery hair, her skin\nspotted with the ashen freckles of her people. Her hair was cut short, just\nbelow the ears, and she wore a black duster that almost touched the ground\nwhen she walked. Her hands were lost in the sleeves, her face shaded by a\nmatching, floppy-brimmed hat. Below the duster she wore weathered\nbuckskins similar to those worn by Palo on the frontier.\nStyke took a deep breath, deciding to just ignore her until she went\naway, when something pricked his senses.\nHe smelled rotten flesh and tasted copper on his tongue, but knew\nimmediately neither of those senses came from this world. It was his\nKnack, warning him that there was sorcery nearby. Potent sorcery,\nbelonging to a bone-eye.\nStyke shifted warily, keeping his eyes on the Palo as she approached.\nHe’d always found it hard to judge the age of Palo women, but she looked\nlike she was in her late twenties or early thirties. She walked toward him\nslowly, calmly, her eyes sleepy and a half smile on her lips.\n“Who is that?” Celine asked.\nStyke shook his head. “Can I help you?” he asked in Palo.\nThe woman stopped about six feet away, her lips pursed, head tilting\nfrom side to side as she studied Styke. He felt tiny pinpricks along his skin,\nthe smell of rotten flesh growing stronger. She removed her hands from her\npockets and showed him that they were empty.\nA Palo bone-eye. Fancy that. What could she possibly want with him?\nHe gave her his best scowl. “Nothing here for you,” he said. “Best move\nalong.”\nShe rolled the sleeves of her duster up, then went through a complex\nseries of gestures. Styke found them almost impossible to follow, and he\njust shook his head at her and made a shooing motion with one hand. She\nsnorted, then pointed at herself, then at him, and Styke inhaled suddenly, his\nnostrils flaring, as he remembered a Palo girl he met in the swamps back\nduring the war. She was small, smelled of blood and sorcery, and she hadn’t\nbeen able to talk.\nShe’d been accompanying Taniel Two-shot at the time and, if Flint was\nright, still was.\nHe took a step back, hand going instinctively to touch Amrec’s neck.\nThe big horse nipped at his ear, then bumped him with its nose. “It’s you,\nisn’t it?” Styke asked. “Taniel’s girl. I remember you from Planth. Ka-\npoel.”\nHer smile widened."

    "text": "isn’t it?” Styke asked. “Taniel’s girl. I remember you from Planth. Ka-\npoel.”\nHer smile widened.\nStyke let out a shaky breath. Sorcery had never frightened him\nparticularly. What unnerved him back at Planth, and here now, was Ka-\npoel’s confidence. She held herself like someone seven feet tall, head high,\nshoulders squared, daring the world to try its worst. “What do you want?”\nhe asked.\nKa-poel remained silent, studying him, then Celine, and finally Amrec.\n“Did Taniel get my note?” Styke asked. “I guess I left it for Tampo, but\nthe two of them are the same, aren’t they?”\nShe stuck her bottom lip out, nodding as if impressed, spreading her\nhands toward him. Very good. She mimed writing, then reading, and pointed\nat him again with a nod.\n“So he did get it.”\nAnother nod.\n“So he knows I quit? I appreciate what he did for me, but I’ve got other\nobligations now. If we cross paths again, I’ll try to do him right, but for\nnow…”\nKa-poel snorted. She folded her arms and shifted her stance, putting her\nweight on her back foot. It almost made Styke laugh, but he could still\nsmell the rotting flesh of her sorcery.\n“I suppose you think that’s not good enough?” he asked.\nShe gave him a look that was less than impressed, then made a flat-\nhanded gesture that he didn’t quite understand. She reached into her duster\npocket and removed an envelope, crossing the space between them to hand\nit over. Styke eyed her warily, breaking the seal with his thumb, then\nrunning his eyes across the writing. It was written in Adran, and said, You\nstill owe me a favor. I intend on collecting it. – T\nStyke handed the letter over his shoulder. “Put this in my saddlebags,”\nhe told Celine. Taniel still expected something, but seemed willing to hold\non to that debt until later. “What’s his game?” Styke asked Ka-poel. “He’s\nplaying long, isn’t he? Huh. Never mind that. What’s your game?”\nKa-poel gave him a cocky smile, chest rising and falling in a silent\nchuckle. Styke rubbed his nose, not enjoying the smell of her sorcery at all.\nShe pointed at him, then at her palm, then at herself, lips moving silently.\nStyke didn’t like the implication.\n“What the pit is that supposed to mean?”\nShe pointed over his shoulder, and it took him a moment to realize she\nwas pointing at the note he’d just handed to Celine.\n“Are you saying I owe you a favor?”\nShe mimed shooting a pistol at him.\nPart of him wanted to wring her neck, then boot her down the road. The\nother part, the part dedicated wholly to self-preservation, said that would be\na very bad idea. “You’re a funny little thing, you know that?”\nShe grinned and mouthed the words I know. She pulled her hand out of\nher pocket and, in a quick move, ran a knife across her left thumb. Styke\nshied away, but she was quicker than he’d expected and stepped over to him"

He grabbed her by the shoulder, shoving her away,\nusing the other hand to wipe at his forehead. She danced out of his reach,\nand he looked at the blood now on his hand and his face.\n“What the pit was that for?” he demanded. “I don’t like sorcery, girl,\nand I won’t stand for – ” His words were arrested by the sound of\nhoofbeats, and Styke took Amrec by the bridle, head tilted to listen to the\napproach of the riders. Blackhats? Or Mad Lancers?\nKa-poel gave him one last smile and slipped around the corner of the\nbuilding. He considered going after her but had no interest in running\nheadfirst into a group of Blackhats. Instead he hunkered in the shade of the\nbuilding and rubbed at his forehead, trying to get all the blood off. He\nlistened to the hoofbeats grow louder, and waited for them to pass him by.\nThey did not.\nHe forgot the blood. The hoofbeats were coming around the outskirts of\nthe village, and it sounded like a lot of them. He pulled his knife, ready to\nthrow himself at the first person to come around the corner, and bit off a\nyell as the first rider rounded it.\nIbana rode on a white stallion almost as big as Amrec, saddle weighed\ndown with carbines, pistols, and cavalry swords. She was followed by\nothers on horseback – Gamble, Sunin, Jackal – all his officers and then\nmore, falling in as Ibana pulled up in front of him. They kept coming, rank\nupon rank, spreading out in a fan, until he could no longer count all of\nthem. Well over two hundred cavalry, all heavily armed on stout warhorses\nand wearing the faded yellow cavalry jackets and black pants they’d been\nissued at the beginning of the Fatrastan War for Independence.\nSunin’s uniform was too big, Gamble’s too small, but each and every\none of them had it. They even had their lances, tied to their saddles and\nwaving yellow streamers in the air. The sight of it overwhelmed him, tears\nthreatening his vision. He sheathed his knife, barely daring to breathe,\nmouth open like a gawking schoolboy.\nIbana dismounted, fetching a carbine, pistol, and heavy cavalry sword\nfrom her saddle and coming over to Styke.\n“You came,” Styke said, unable to think of any other words.\nIbana rolled her eyes, thrusting the bundle of weapons into his arms.\n“Of course I did, you big fool. We all did. You’re Mad Ben Styke, and\nwithout you we aren’t the Mad Lancers.”\nStyke looked over her shoulder at his old officers, and all the familiar\nfaces gathered behind them.

Yet here they were.\nThe faces stared back at him, expectant, and it took him several\nmoments to realize they were waiting for him to say something. He shook\nhis head and glanced at Ibana, wondering what she told them about their\ncurrent mission. “We’re not going to fight the Blackhats,” he said, raising\nhis voice.\nHe was greeted by silence. No mutters. No scowls. Just soldiers waiting\nfor their orders.\n“I never much fancied us as mercenaries,” he said. “But the Mad\nLancers always rode to protect Fatrasta, and Fatrasta, in case you noticed,\ndoesn’t really want us right now.” Some of the riders exchanged looks, no\ndoubt remembering what they’d lost at the hands of the Blackhats the last\nfew days. “The only one who wants us is Lady Flint. She’s been hired to\nprotect Landfall from that Dynize fleet sitting out beyond the bay. It may\ncome to a scrap. It may not. Regardless, she’s going to pay us, feed us, and\nkit us up. She’s also dead set on keeping us and the Blackhats from each\nother’s throats. I’ve made my peace with that, and if any of you have a\nproblem you can talk to me about it, or you can turn around and ride back to\nLandfall. That’s up to you.”\n“We don’t need any protecting from the Blackhats!” someone in the\nback shouted.\nStyke searched for the source of the voice, but couldn’t find it. “Like pit\nwe don’t,” he said. “But I don’t mind having them off our asses long\nenough for us to become the Mad Lancers again. We’re old, we’re rusty. Pit,\nI’m healed up a bit but I’m still a damn cripple. I’d rather ride a free man as\npart of the Landfall garrison than skulk around in the shadows waiting to\nget overwhelmed. Now, like I said, if you have a problem no one will hold\nit against you if you go. Ya hear?”\nThe gathered cavalry responded with a stoic silence. Leather creaked;\nhorses shifted and whinnied. Sunin, looking almost ninety, her hair white\nand wispy, skin as wrinkled as a prune, leaned over in her saddle and spat a\nwad of chew into the grass.\n“We don’t ride for Lady Flint or Fatrasta,” she said with her northern\nFatrastan twang. “We ride for Ben Styke.” The riders behind her nodded\nsagely, a mutter of approval going up. “If you want us working for Lady\nFlint, we’ll work for Lady Flint. We’ll follow orders. But don’t think for a\nmoment we’ll forget the state we found you in the other night.”\n“That how you all feel?” Styke demanded.\nA chorus of “yeah” and “bet we do” rose up over the lancers.\n“Because you’re all a bunch of fools,” Styke grumbled. “Always have\nbeen.”\n“Yeah, but they’re your fools,” Ibana said.\n“Suppose so.

He rubbed at his forehead. “Is there\nblood on my face?” he asked.\n“No,” Ibana responded.\nStyke glanced down at his hand. There wasn’t any blood there, either.\nHe wondered if he’d imagined the whole thing – Ka-poel, Taniel’s letter. He\nwondered if perhaps his mind was slipping. “Where’s my banner?”\nIbana returned to her saddlebags, untying a long, oiled leather tube. She\nremoved a bundle of cloth from the tube and, holding one end, let the rest\nunfurl. The banner was black on yellow with a crimson border, the center\ndominated by a grinning human skull spit upon a lance. Styke held out his\nhand, taking the banner for himself, rubbing the rough material between his\nthumb and forefinger.\n“Jackal,” he said. “Your lance.”\nHe fixed the banner in place and then handed the lance back to Jackal\nwith a nod.\n“Bannerman,” Styke said. “Lead us to Jedwar. We have a command to\npick up.”\nCHAPTER 50\nF\nirst thing in the morning, Michel left his small apartment in Fallen End\nand went to the local bank a few blocks over. He was on edge as he\nwalked inside, his nerves still frayed from the visit to the monolith the day\nbefore, and was functioning on just a couple of hours of restless sleep.\nWhispers had filled his night, and none of them had been pleasant. He\nwondered how those researchers managed to stay near the godstone – and\nthat more of them didn’t go mad from exposure.\nThe bank was small, sleepy, with just two clerks, a single vault, and a\nrow of lockboxes along the back wall behind the clerks. Michel hadn’t been\ninside it in four years, and hoped he remembered the right number. He took\nbank stationery, wrote down the lot number of the monolith dig site – and\nspecific directions that it was two miles south of Landfall – along with the\nword “CAUTION.”\n“Number 132,” he said, handing the note along with a single krana over\nto the teller. Michel tapped the brim of his hat and left.\nHe had, no doubt, several folders on his desk with reports about how\nmuch nothing his new underlings had found in their search for Styke. He’d\nhave to attend to those at some point. He should have done it last night, but\nthe monolith had unnerved him enough to send him straight to home, a\nwarm bath, and bed. Though none of that had helped him sleep.\nInstead, he’d spent the disquieting hours putting his marble back\ntogether. His self – his real self – was safely stored away. With that note\ndispatched to Taniel, Michel could go back to being the good little\nBlackhat, heart and soul. He’d be a model Gold Rose, rooting out Fatrasta’s\nenemies from a new place of privilege, worming his way up the ladder. Pit,\nin a few years maybe he’d be one of Fidelis Jes’s confidants."

Pit,\nin a few years maybe he’d be one of Fidelis Jes’s confidants.\nThe higher he climbed, the easier it would be to help Taniel burn the\nwhole thing down.\n“No,” he said to himself sternly as he walked, hands in his pockets,\nalong the morning streets of Landfall. “You’re Agent Bravis now. Not a\nwhisper – not even a thought – of the man you were.”\n“Taniel,” he answered in agreement, “is on his own with that… thing.”\n“And I’m going to forget it ever existed.”\n“Right.”\nMichel stopped by an early market, collecting several canvas bags of\nfood, even stopping by a discount bookseller to grab a few penny novels at\nrandom. He found himself whistling, walking slow, ignoring the urgency he\nknew he should be feeling to get back to the Millinery and help find Styke.\nFor the first time in a long time, he actually wanted to get to Mother’s home\nafter she returned from her usual perusal of the local bookstores.\nHe walked all the way to Proctor, a full forty minutes. He paused by the\nback alley to his mother’s home and, still whistling, went around to the\nfront, knocking once and letting himself inside. For once he was going to\nweather her lectures with a smile. For once he’d allow himself the small\nfantasy of telling her who he really was – though it would, of course,\nremain just a fantasy.\nHe immediately went to her small table, clearing away books and old\ncanvas totes to set her food down, then turning toward her chair by the\nwindow. He froze, the whistled tune dying on his lips as he realized that the\nfigure he’d spotted out of the corner of his eye in his mother’s rocker was\nnot, in fact, his mother.\nIt was Fidelis Jes.\nMichel straightened, clasping his hands behind his back to hide their\nsudden tremble, and tried to act casual as he knocked a whole box of books\noff Mother’s table. “Sir!”\nFidelis Jes rocked softly in her chair. He seemed back to his old self –\nhair slicked back, shirt pressed, face immaculately stoic. He gazed out the\nwindow down the street, a contemplative look on his face. His sword was\nunbuckled but still sheathed, lying across his knees, one hand resting on the\nhilt. Why the pit was he here? A thousand possibilities went through\nMichel’s head, none of them good, but the grand master remained silent.\n“Sir,” Michel managed again, hoping he didn’t stutter, “this is an\nunexpected honor. Is there something wrong? Has something happened\nwith the Styke business?” He grimaced, telling himself to shut up. People\nwent to Fidelis Jes. He did not come to them. This was unprecedented.\nAnd the fact it was his mother’s house was more than a little terrifying.\nMichel took a step back and craned his head to look up into the loft. His\nmother wasn’t there. Had she been taken away? Was she out running\nerrands? Just as Michel’s nerves were about to get the best of him, Fidelis\nJes finally spoke."

Just as Michel’s nerves were about to get the best of him, Fidelis\nJes finally spoke.\n“The Styke business has been called off. For now. The Dynize have our\nattention.” Jes turned his gaze on Michel – stony, penetrating. There was no\nanger or pleasure in the grand master’s eyes. Michel could not read him in\nthe slightest. “Tell me, Agent Bravis, how has your own search gone?”\n“Ah, not well, I’m afraid,” Michel said, speaking too loudly. “You see,\nthere are a lot of reports on my desk I need to go through but Warsim will\nlet me know as soon as we find anything and again let me tell you what an\nhonor it is to have this…” Michel trailed off, licking his lips. Fidelis Jes\nremained expressionless.\n“I’m not talking about that search,” Jes said. “I meant the other one. The\none you are conducting that gave you the strongest urge to search the upper\narchives within hours of receiving your Gold Rose.”\nOh. Oh shit.\n“I’m not sure what you mean, sir. Dellina didn’t give me any\ninstructions regarding the upper archives.”\n“No,” Jes said. “She did not. But the man who was clever enough to\nwork his way up to Gold Rose, even during a time of crisis, could figure out\nhow to enter the archives. It’s not difficult – which is why the archives are\nheavily warded. We keep records of when someone enters, and one of the\narchivists noted a man of your description fleeing just an hour after you\nentered.”\nMichel swallowed. Okay, this wasn’t so bad. He could manage this. A\nplausible excuse was all he needed – information he craved, something that\nmight get him into trouble, but not too much trouble. His mind raced,\nlooking for the proper story to spin while keeping his face carefully neutral.\n“Tell me, Agent Bravis. Why were you in the upper archives when we\nso dearly need everyone searching for Styke?”\n“I thought…”\n“You might find information there to help you track down Styke?” Jes\nfinished, a slight smile touching his lips.\n“… Yes, sir.”\n“A likely excuse, certainly. Then why did you visit Professor Cressel at\nthe monolith dig yesterday afternoon? Was that some kind of wrong turn? A\nmistake? Or did you think you’d find Styke there, too?” Jes’s tone turned\nmocking, and he suddenly slid to his feet, taking his sheathed sword in hand\nlike a truncheon and doing a quick circuit around Michel the same way he’d\ndone the first time Michel was called into his office. It reminded Michel\nexactly what he was to the grand master: a piece of meat.\n“Think fast, Agent Bravis,” Jes whispered into his ear. “I’m very\ninterested in your excuses.”\nMichel tilted his head back slightly, Jes’s whisper raising his hackles\nlike nails on a chalkboard. It said, very clearly, that there weren’t any\nexcuses. Nothing would get him out of this. He tried to focus on something\n– anything – to get his mind around what was happening. He scrabbled\nmentally for some sort of bedrock.\n“Where’s my mother?” he croaked."

He scrabbled\nmentally for some sort of bedrock.\n“Where’s my mother?” he croaked.\n“Hm,” Jes said, doing another circuit and stopping just behind Michel’s\nleft shoulder. Michel cringed inwardly, waiting for a blade or a fist or just\nabout any kind of violence. “Tell me, Agent Bravis, why are you looking for\nthe godstones?”\nMichel cleared his throat. “Where’s my mother?” he asked again.\n“That’s not important,” Jes responded. “Who do you really work for,\nBravis? Is it Brudania? The Deliv royal cabal? Adro? Well?” The last word\ncame out a shout, and Michel finally flinched. Jes continued the circuit,\ncoming back into Michel’s frame of vision and stopping in front of him. He\ntook the end of his sword, tapping Michel on the shoulder, then the elbow,\nthen the side of his knee. They were the taps of a butcher checking for the\ntenderest spots of meat.\n“You know this isn’t going to go well for you, Agent Bravis. If you tell\nus everything it will… well, it’ll still be very painful. But much, much\nshorter. I can assure you of that.” Jes laughed to himself, as if this whole\nthing was really quite funny. “I’m genuinely impressed. You worked your\nway up to a Gold Rose only to betray yourself the very first day. I can’t\nimagine how impatient you must have been to slip up so quickly. It’s a\ncombination of skill and stupidity that I haven’t seen for a very, very long\ntime.”\nMichel felt a tear roll down his left cheek. His fists were balled so\ntightly that his fingernails drew blood. He took several deep breaths, trying\nto come to some sort of acceptance that his life was over, but all he could\nthink about were the books on the table behind him, and the fact that Fidelis\nJes had sat in his mother’s rocker. It was that unspoken threat that got to\nhim worse than anything Jes was saying now, and it made his stomach twist\ninto a knot.\n“Where,” he demanded, “is my mother?”\nJes turned around, stepping toward the door. “You should have worried\nfor her health before you did all this, Agent Bravis. And to think, you were\nso promising…”\nMichel dug into his coat pocket, fingers wrapping around the familiar\nbrass of his knuckledusters. He took a quick step forward, drawing back\nwith all his might and swinging his fist. His best bet was to make Jes kill\nhim right now – end it quick, with the least amount of pain and maybe, just\nmaybe, Jes would have no use for his mother.\nBut Jes didn’t step out of the way, draw his sword, and run Michel\nthrough.\nMichel’s knuckledusters connected with the base of Jes’s neck and the\ngrand master dropped like a sack of potatoes. In half a breath, Michel found\nhimself staring down at the unmoving form, mouth agape, unable to\ncomprehend what had just happened. Then he did the only thing that came\nto mind:\nHe fled.\nHe was less than a block from the house when he rounded a corner and\nran headlong into his mother.

She screamed, books scattering in the street as\nthe two of them went down in a heap. Michel regained his feet while his\nmother crawled around, swearing and grumbling, trying to stuff penny\nnovels back into her satchels. He grabbed her under the arm, trying to help\nher up.\n“You pillok!” she said, jerking her arm away. “Why don’t you watch\nwhere you’re going?”\n“Damn it, Mother, we don’t have time for this.” He scooped her up\nbodily, depositing her on her feet. She squinted at him. “Michel? What are\nyou doing here?”\n“Saving your life,” he said, dragging her along behind him.\n“Wait, my books!”\n“I’ll buy you more!” He pulled her along until they were both running\ndown the street, huffing and puffing. They made it less than a block before\nhis mother stopped him, gasping for breath.\n“What is going on?” she demanded. “And what is that?”\nMichel looked down to see the Gold Rose had fallen out of his shirt. He\nstuffed it back, shaking his head. “Ignore that, I…” He paused. “Damn it! I\nshould have damn well made sure he was dead.” He took two steps back\ntoward her house, stopped himself, then waved toward a nearby hackney\ncab. “Never mind. It’s too late. Shit, shit, shit.”\nHis mother slapped him on the shoulder. “Why are you cursing? And\nwhat’s the meaning of this? I was going to spend the afternoon reading.”\n“You spend every afternoon reading!”\nHer eyes suddenly widened as she caught up to what he’d said a\nmoment ago. “And what do you mean, you should have made sure he was\ndead? Who?”\nMichel leapt into the hackney cab as it pulled up beside the curb and\nshouted for the driver to head to Greenfire Depths. Once they were seated\nhe let himself take a deep breath, wishing he had something to drink. He\nlooked out the window, waiting for someone to come running after the cab,\nor a squad of Blackhats to burst from an alley. That arrogant bastard had\ncome after Michel alone. There was no one to chase him down.\nBut there would be.\n“Fidelis Jes,” he said finally. “I left him lying on your floor. I might\nhave killed him.”\nThe Riflejack cavalry were having breakfast in their camp outside of\nJedwar when Styke, Ibana, and Jackal rode through their tents and corrals,\naccompanied by one of their outriders.\nStyke fell into old habits, glancing around at the equipment and state of\nthe horses and men. Saddles were oiled, swords sharpened, and the carbines\nlooked well cared for. The men lounged beside their morning cook fires,\nstirring pots and playing cards, their uniforms well worn but clean. He used\nthe examination to focus on something other than how much his ass hurt.\n“The corrals are sturdy,” Ibana said approvingly.\n“You bet they are,” a man said, standing up beside Styke’s horse.

He\nwas tall and lean, with the strong shoulders and bowed legs of someone\nwho spent a lot of time in the saddle – and swinging a sword from one. He\nhad light brown hair and mutton chops, and a clean-shaven face. He fetched\nhis jacket from a nearby post and slid it on over his shoulders. “We’re\nAdran cavalry. We don’t screw around.” He eyed the lancers’ jackets, and\nthe banner waving over Jackal’s head. “You’re Fatrastan military?” he\nasked.\n“Who’s in command?” Styke asked.\nThe soldier considered the question for a moment. “Colonel Olem. If\nyou want to talk to him, you’ll have to head to Landfall.”\n“Just came from there,” Ibana responded. She leaned over in her saddle,\nhanding the man a sealed letter. “Who’s second in command?”\n“I’m Major Gustar, so I guess that would be me,” the man responded,\ntaking the letter and frowning at the seal, which was stamped with the\ncrossed rifles and shako of the Riflejacks. “What’s this here?”\n“New orders,” Styke said. “My name’s Colonel Ben Styke, and I’ve\nbeen ordered to take command of your cavalry.” He bit his cheek, waiting\nfor a fight. No one liked their command taken from them.\nMajor Gustar cast him a long, cool glance. Several of his men bristled\nopenly, but Gustar simply said, “Sorry, Colonel, but we’re Riflejacks. We\ndon’t take commands from foreign officers. Not unless Lady Flint tells us to\ndirectly.”\n“You might want to give those orders a read,” Ibana suggested.\nGustar broke the seal and read through the letter, his eyes widening as\nhe went. When he next looked up, his mouth was slightly agape. “You’re\nthat Ben Styke?”\n“In the flesh,” Styke replied. For the first time in a while, that little bit\nof awe in someone’s voice didn’t feel like a slap in the face for what he\nused to be. It felt good.\n“And you’re a Riflejack now?”\n“We all are; we just don’t have uniforms yet, so this old Fatrastan getup\nwill have to do. This is Major Ibana ja Fles. She has direct command of the\nMad Lancers. I’ll leave you in charge of the Riflejack dragoons and\ncuirassiers. You both report to me.”\nGustar snapped a salute. “Sir. Yes, sir. It’ll be a pleasure serving under\nyou.”\n“Say that again after I’ve ordered you to charge a pike line,” Styke said.\n“We’re needed in Landfall. Ibana will catch you up on the way. I want\neveryone ready to ride within a half hour.”\n“They’ll be ready in fifteen minutes,” Gustar said. “Up and at ’em,\nboys, we’ve got work to do!”\nStyke took a deep breath, taking in the smoke of the cook fires, the\nsmell of the horses, the sickly sweet scent of manure heaps, and the sour\nstench of unwashed soldiers at camp.

His lungs yearned for all of it and\nmore – for the corpses on the field and the fresh scent of crushed grass and\npowder smoke after a skirmish.\nHe pointed down at Gustar. “You. I think I’m going to like you.”\nCHAPTER 51\nV\nlora was shown into the foreign dignitary room of the capitol building\nthe morning after accepting command of the defenses of Fatrasta. She\nwore her parade uniform: Adran blues with silver trim and crimson cuffs,\nthe crossed rifles of the Riflejack Mercenary Company emblazoned above\nher left breast opposite two dozen medals for acts of valor she’d long\nforgotten.\nThe foreign dignitary room was a large, vaulted chamber decorated with\nyellow and white marble, lit by three enormous chandeliers and high banks\nof windows that looked out over the edge of the Landfall Plateau and out to\nsea. Opposite the windows were rows of tiered seating for the elite of\nFatrasta, while an immense, oval ironwood table occupied the very center\nof the room, surrounded by dozens of high-backed chairs.\nThe room had seating for hundreds of people and could probably fit\nmore than a thousand, but the only occupants were Vlora and Lady\nChancellor Lindet.\nLindet sat at the table, a glass of iced coffee and a spread of papers in\nfront of her. She looked up as Vlora’s boots echoed across the marble floors\nand gave a brief, condescending smile. Vlora didn’t take it personally. From\nwhat she understood, Lindet was condescending to everyone.\n“Lady Flint,” she said. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you.”\nThe words were quiet, pleasant, pitched so as not to echo. Vlora\nrounded the table to be opposite of Lindet – likely where the Dynize\ndelegation would sit in a short time – and leaned on one of the high-backed\nchairs. She inclined her head. “Lady Chancellor. Aren’t we expecting the\nDynize ambassador any moment?”\nLindet consulted a pocket watch. “Thirteen minutes,” she said.\n“Shouldn’t this room be… full?” Vlora had passed Fatrastan dignitaries\ntwittering away in the halls of the capitol building by the score, the whole\nlot practically seething nervous anticipation. The emergence of the Dynize\nEmpire from isolation was the most exciting thing to happen here since\nFatrasta declared their independence from Kez. To the businessmen and\npoliticians waiting outside, the fact that the Dynize had arrived with a fleet\nof warships was barely worth a mention.\nUnfortunately, that made those warships entirely Vlora’s problem.\n“I’ll allow them in when I’m ready,” Lindet said. She perused a page of\nstationery in front of her before signing the bottom and sliding it off to one\nside. “I’m so glad you took Jes’s offer.”\n“It was enough money to let all of my men retire comfortably when this\nis over,” Vlora responded.\n“Purely mercenary,” Lindet said with a small smile. “I can respect that.”\nThe money hadn’t been all of it, of course.

He also pointed out that an unattached mercenary company could\neasily be seen as an enemy of the state were the Dynize to prove\nantagonistic, and that his Blackhats would be forced to turn on her. More\npersonally, Vlora relished the idea of defending the people of Fatrasta for\nonce, rather than putting down their insurrections.\nVlora kept all of that in her head, instead answering Lindet with a nod.\n“If the Dynize have designs on Landfall, my men will hold it. I’ll admit I’m\nsurprised that you’ve put me in command of the entire city defense.”\nSurprised didn’t even cover it. She’d been handed command of a fourteen-\nthousand-man garrison, five forts, and another six thousand auxiliaries.\nUnless she was reading the politics wrong – which was a possibility – that\nmade her one of the most powerful people in Landfall, answerable only to\nLindet.\n“You’re the protégée of Field Marshal Tamas and the veteran of two\nwars and countless other engagements. Is there anyone else more qualified\nin the city?”\n“No,” Vlora admitted.\nLindet signed another paper. “The worst-case scenario,” she said, “is\nthat the Dynize are here to invade. In which case I’ve secured an extra\nbrigade of riflemen and a decorated commander and removed the\npossibility of you being hired by my enemies. The best-case scenario is that\nthe Dynize just happen to be out for a pleasure cruise with an entire fleet,\nand I’ve locked you into a four-year contract as defender of the shores of\nmy nation. It seemed fairly win-win.”\n“You could have bought ten brigades for what you’re paying us.”\n“I don’t have ten brigades handy to buy,” Lindet said. “Are you in the\nhabit of telling employers that they’ve overpaid, Lady Flint?”\n“No, ma’am. Forgive me for asking, but do you have any particular\nreason for thinking the Dynize are here for any other reason than peace?”\n“Other than thirty-eight warships and a whole flotilla of support\nfrigates?”\n“Yes, other than those.”\nLindet made a “hmm” sound that was neither an affirmative nor denial.\n“Ma’am?”\nLindet looked at her over the tops of her spectacles, the brief smile\nreturning. “I also understand that you’ve deputized the Mad Lancers into\nthe Riflejacks. Is that correct?”\nVlora swallowed, noting that Lindet had dodged the question about the\nDynize. She would have to come back to that. The subject of the Mad\nLancers wasn’t one she’d been looking forward to, but she hadn’t hired\nthem purely out of need. She’d also hired them because she knew it would\ncause an argument – an argument that would set the tone for her\nrelationship with Lindet going forward. She braced herself for the coming\nfight. “Yes, ma’am.”\n“Good.”\n“Excuse me?” Vlora struggled to hide her surprise.\nAnother page was signed and set aside. “It makes Styke your problem,"

I’ve instructed Fidelis Jes to steer clear of the\nMad Lancers for now. I expect you to do the same for Styke. If you can.\nThis Dynize fleet is more pressing a matter than internal squabbles.”\nVlora exhaled the breath she’d taken in anticipation of a shouting\nmatch. “I’ll keep Styke on a short leash.”\n“Good luck with that.” Lindet checked her pocket watch again. “Eight\nminutes.” She raised her voice. “You may allow everyone inside!”\nVlora didn’t see any attendants, but the doors to the room were thrown\nopen and a stream of people poured in. She recognized businessmen,\npoliticians, Kressian ambassadors, and even the chief constable of the\nLandfall police. Within minutes the tiered seating was filled, as well as half\nof the chairs around the oval table. Vlora left the spot across from Lindet\nand rounded to stand beside her.\nShe spotted Vallencian off in one corner of the room, but when she\nraised her hand to greet him he looked away. The snub was not unexpected.\nThe Ice Baron, she had assumed, would not be pleased that she had used his\nintroduction to Palo society as a way to arrest Mama Palo. She didn’t\nconsider herself terribly vain, but the knowledge that he was no longer an\nenthusiastic fan made her a bit sad.\nBut she had more important things to think about. “Where is Jes, by the\nway?” she asked, casting about for the grand master.\n“Personally overseeing security,” Lindet answered. “The Palo have\nengaged in some light rioting since we executed Mama Palo. The last thing\nI need is some fool revolutionary taking a shot at the Dynize ambassador\nand causing an international incident.” Lindet glanced up, a look of\nannoyance crossing her face. “Would you please stop hovering and have a\nseat?” She indicated the chair to her right.\nVlora took the spot hesitantly. No one had told her she’d be sitting\nbeside Lindet during the meeting. She wondered whether her place was\nexpedience, or flattery. Probably a little of both.\nA light hand touched her shoulder, and she looked up to find Olem\nstanding just beside her. She didn’t realize that she’d been holding her\nbreath before she let it out in a soft sigh. She gestured him closer. “I was\nnot,” she whispered, “ready to get back into politics.”\n“Really?” he asked. “Because you just dove in headfirst.”\n“I thought I was agreeing to fight. Why the pit am I at this table?”\n“Defender of Fatrasta comes with a little more than just a combat role, I\nimagine,” Olem commented.\n“Pit. Will you be here through the whole thing?”\n“I’ll be seated just over there,” Olem said, indicating a spot on the\nbottom row of seating behind her.\n“Thank Adom. I feel like I’m sitting in a den of wolves.”\n“You are, love. You are.”"

Olem rarely got more informal than her\nfirst name in public, and she felt her cheeks redden. “Thank you,” she\nwhispered back.\n“For?”\n“Being here.”\n“Never want to be anywhere else.”\n“You have no idea how much that helps. By the way, just how mad is\nVallencian about the Mama Palo thing?”\n“I found out this morning that no café in Landfall will serve ice to a\nRiflejack, if that’s any indication.”\nVlora took a deep breath. That was going to be a hit to morale. Ice was\nabout the only way the boys were getting through this stinking hot summer.\n“Send him a present. Something handsome, but practical. Dig through my\nsea chest to see if I have any old souvenir that might soften him up.”\n“I’ll give it a try.”\nA messenger suddenly arrived, whispering something in Lindet’s ear.\nLindet stood up, turning to the door. The rest of the room, Vlora included,\nstood up with her, while Olem hurried back to his seat.\nThe messenger announced in a loud, clear voice, “The esteemed Ka-\nsedial, adviser to the throne of Emperor Janen I, Admiral of the Black Fleet\nand carrier of the imperial seal.”\nThe man who entered the room was not, by any stretch of the\nimagination, impressive. He looked in his mid-sixties, with tufts of gray\nhair on the sides of a mostly bald head. His face was clean-shaven, a weak\nchin accentuated by a large nose and soft features. He wore a colorful gown\nof teal, purple, black, and yellow, raven’s feathers dangling from each ear.\nHe walked slowly, his hands clasped behind his back, taking in the room\nand assembly with a pleasant but slightly disdainful air.\nVlora’s senses began to tingle, and she didn’t have to open her third eye\nto tell that this man had sorcery. She immediately dismissed the idea that he\nwas a Privileged, and then a Knacked. He definitely wasn’t a powder mage.\nThat left just one possibility, and it made her slightly ill.\nHe was a bone-eye, a blood sorcerer. The last time she’d met one of\nthose had been Ka-poel. And she’d helped kill a god.\nThe bone-eye rounded the table, bowed briefly to Lindet, and then took\na seat with the soft sigh of someone getting too old to spend much time on\ntheir feet. No one else came through the door, leaving Ka-sedial alone on\nthe other side of the table, flanked by a dozen empty chairs. He didn’t seem\nto mind.\nVlora glanced sidelong at Lindet, whose expression remained as placid\nas the bone-eye’s across from her. She sat, and so did the rest of the room.\nThe room grew deathly still and silent. Someone in the hall outside\nsneezed. It felt as if the whole room was holding their breath, until Lindet\nlifted a single finger and one of her aides sprang to her side. “Where is his\ntranslator?” she asked. “We offered him one, didn’t we?”"

Vlora leaned into the corner of her seat, fingers\non her chin, marveling at the power dynamic here. Lindet was the most\nfeared person in this part of the world, and yet this single bone-eye seemed\nto be trying to upstage her in every way.\n“Well,” Lindet replied, “that saves us the trouble. Ka-sedial, welcome to\nFatrasta.”\n“Thank you, Lady Chancellor.”\n“It’s tradition,” Lindet said, “to ask guests about the news from their\nhomeland, but I’m afraid that might take a while. We are a hundred years\nbehind.”\nKa-sedial tilted his head to one side, looking slightly bored. “Not at all.\nThere was a civil war. Millions died to sword, famine, and sorcery. It has\ntaken four generations, but the imperial family has retaken their rightful\nthrone and brought peace to Dynize.”\n“Ah. Peace. I’m glad to hear it.” Lindet did not sound at all glad to hear\nit.\n“As are we.”\nVlora noted that Ka-sedial did not reciprocate the question of news. He\nwouldn’t, she decided. Not when the Dynize had been spying on Fatrasta\nfor who knew how long. She wondered whether Lindet had sent her own\nspies into Dynize. The countries of the Nine had stopped bothering to\napproach the Empire over fifty years ago, but with access to Palo that\nwould speak the Dynize language and look the part, Lindet might have\nactually gotten the chance to crack that nut.\nIt wasn’t a great time to ask.\n“I’m afraid,” Lindet said, “that my next question might come off as\nrude, but it is the foremost on our minds and I would like to put my people\nat ease.”\nKa-sedial smiled. “Why, you’re wondering, is there a fleet of warships\noutside your harbor?”\n“Precisely,” Lindet said with a sour smile.\n“It’s an expedition,” Ka-sedial said simply. “The Empire hasn’t had a\nfleet to speak of since the last squadron was sunk off the Ebony Coast over\nseventy years ago. We’ve barred our borders to outsiders, kept ourselves\nand our problems isolated to our country. We’ve only been at peace with\nourselves for about seven years now, and in that time we’ve had to rebuild\nso, so much – including our ships.”\n“And now that you’ve rebuilt them, what do you intend to do with\nthem?”\nKa-sedial drummed his fingers gently on the table. “That depends on\nyou, Lady Chancellor.”\nAn audible gasp came from the assembly, and Vlora didn’t blame them.\nThe words were innocuous, but the tone held an unmistakable threat.

At the end of the war, his tongue was cut out as part\nof the peace settlement.\nVlora cleared her throat. “Ambassador, every expedition has a goal.\nWhat is yours?”\nKa-sedial turned his attention slowly toward her, like a lizard who’s\nspied a particularly fat mealworm. She wondered if his spies had reported\nher to him.\n“Lady Flint, I presume?”\nThat seemed to be a yes about the spies, she noted. “That is I.”\n“We’ve only come looking for what is rightfully ours.”\nThe whole room hung on the sentence, tension thick enough to cut. “I’m\ncurious,” Lindet said, “what exactly you think that is.” Her expression had\nnot changed, but her voice had gone dangerously quiet. The assembly\nseemed to lean forward as one, straining to hear.\nKa-sedial didn’t seem to have a problem hearing. “These lands\nbelonged to the Empire at one time,” he said, almost wistfully. “You’ve\nbuilt your little nation atop the great ruins of our ancestors.”\n“And you expect to take that back?” Vlora asked flatly.\n“No, no,” Ka-sedial said. “It’s been a very long century. My people are\nweary of war, and I understand that this is a modern age. We have no\nintention of conquering. We are only here for our rightful property, and\nonce we have it we will be gone.”\nYou’re using the word “rightful” quite a lot. I don’t think that means\nwhat it once did, not since Tamas beheaded the rightful king of Adro. Vlora\nglanced at Lindet, but the Lady Chancellor had sunk back in her seat,\nexamining Ka-sedial through a hawk’s narrowed eyes. She did not respond.\nThe silence dragged on for ten seconds, then twenty, then thirty. Ka-\nsedial finally leaned forward, his expression impatient. “We want the\ngodstones returned to us.”\nThere was a confused murmur from the gallery behind her, only cut off\nby Lindet’s voice ringing out loudly. “Everyone out!”\nThe room was clear within a minute, leaving only the fifteen or so\npeople at the oval table remaining. Everyone’s eyes were glued on Lindet.\n“What are the godstones?” Vlora asked. Ka-sedial stared at Lindet.\nLindet stared back. Vlora leaned over to her and repeated her question\nquietly. Lindet ignored her, turning to whisper to the Privileged sorcerer\nsitting on her left. Vlora’s attention was on Ka-sedial, but she caught the\nquiet response.\n“We’ll have it secured, ma’am.”\nWhether Ka-sedial heard their whispers, Vlora couldn’t be sure. He\nlooked from Lady Chancellor to Privileged and then back again. “We know\nyou have them, and you know they belong to us. Hand them over and we’ll\nleave these shores immediately.”\n“Or what?” Lindet said.\nVlora resisted the urge to glance back at Olem. This conversation had\nturned badly very quickly. “What are the godstones?” she asked again."

This conversation had\nturned badly very quickly. “What are the godstones?” she asked again.\n“Or we take them by force,” Ka-sedial said.\n“I thought you said your people are weary of war?” Vlora asked\nsarcastically. She wanted an answer about these godstones, and it was clear\nthat everyone here was ignoring her questions.\n“Hm. They are, Lady Flint. But some things are more important than a\nmuch-needed respite. We are weary, but we are also ready. If you think us\nbroken by so much war, think again. Our armies are hardened veterans,\nraised on the taste of blood. I will let them drink again if I must.”\nVlora looked at Lindet, but the Lady Chancellor still had not answered.\nVlora wanted to reach over and shake her. “What,” she demanded, “is so\nimportant about these godstones?”\n“Everything,” Lindet said. Her voice was barely above a whisper.\n“Yes,” Ka-sedial agreed. “Everything. The future of my very country\ndepends upon their retrieval, and keeping them from us will be seen as an\nact of war.”\nLindet suddenly stood. “You will have my answer by tomorrow. Good\nday, Ambassador.” She left the table so quickly that the others scrambled to\nfollow her, Vlora included. She glanced behind her as she left the room to\nfind Ka-sedial still seated, with a determined expression that looked more\nlike an avenging angel than a frail old man.\nVlora rushed to catch up to Lindet. “Are you going to explain to me\nwhat just happened?”\n“Nothing that I had planned,” Lindet responded. “You have until\ntomorrow to prepare the garrison for war. Send out messengers. Recall all\nmy armies from the frontier, and raise levies from every city in Fatrasta.”\nVlora’s stomach tightened, twisting over itself in knots. That was not\nthe command of someone who expected a blockade. That was the command\nof someone who expected a full-blown war. “What,” she growled, “are\nthese godstones?”\nLindet lifted her chin. “I believe you have work to do, General.” She\nstrode off, leaving Vlora standing alone, openmouthed.\nOlem found her a few moments later, after pushing his way through the\ncrowd of confused dignitaries. “What happened after she kicked everyone\nout?” he asked.\n“I’m still not entirely sure.” She looked at her hands, then up at Olem.\n“Have our men transitioned to Fort Nied?”\n“Yes, but…”\n“No buts. Send word that we have until morning to prepare for an\ninvasion.”\nCHAPTER 52\nV\nlora arrived at Fort Nied an hour after the Dynize ambassador’s visit\ncame to a sudden end. The traffic had been almost impassable the entire\nway down the east slope of the Landfall Plateau, forcing her to walk the last\nquarter of a mile, listening to the gossip spread like wildfire among\nshopkeeps, pedestrians, and laborers.

She could feel the city pulse with uncertain anticipation,\nand like a spring coiled too tightly the tension felt ready to snap.\nOlem had gone on ahead on horseback, and by the time Vlora reached\nthe fort her artillery crews stood at the ready and riflemen manned the\nbattlements. An ensign brought her up to speed as she came in through the\nfront gate: Riflejacks manned the fort, while the rest of the brigade had\nbeen distributed in patrol lines all along the length of the bay and docks,\nand messengers flooded in with news that the entire Fatrastan garrison was\nmustering at wooden forts both north and south of the city. Vlora turned the\nmessengers right around with orders to have full troop reports by nightfall,\nthen stopped to take stock of her new command post.\nFort Nied was not, thankfully, an ancient palisade like Loel’s Fort. It\nwas a modern star fortress directly on the bay, positioned to force all ships\naround it to reach the docks. It had open firing lanes on three points of the\nstar to the ocean, and was protected by immense blocks of limestone\nenchanted by Lindet’s Privileged to shrug off both cannon fire and sorcery.\nThe fort had survived a withering bombardment by the Kez fleet during\nthe Fatrastan Revolution. It would, she assured herself, hold up again.\nA messenger touched her arm. “Lady Flint, Colonel Olem says to tell\nyou that the Dynize ambassador has returned to his ship.”\n“Right,” Vlora said, jogging up the steps to the easternmost star on the\nfortress and standing on her tiptoes to look out to sea. She took a hit of\npowder, relishing the brief rush of sorcery and adrenaline before focusing\non the ships. Sailors and soldiers stood stoically at attention. She was able\nto pick out Ka-sedial up on the forecastle of the flagship, speaking to what\nlooked to be the captain. “I’d give my left arm to know what that asshole is\nsaying right now.”\n“No,” a voice said over her shoulder. “Maybe a little finger. Never an\narm.”\nAfter everything that had happened, Vlora was still surprised to find\nTaniel standing behind her. Not Tampo the lawyer, but Taniel himself in the\nflesh. He wore a demure black coat and hat, his collar high. Just behind him\nstood a Palo woman, shorter even than Vlora and still as slight as she’d\nbeen ten years ago. She wore a black duster, her hands buried in the sleeves,\nand when Vlora locked eyes with her she winked.\n“Hello, Ka-poel. Good to see you.” Which might have been a stretch.\nVlora had discovered long ago that being warm to the woman who wound\nup with her ex-fiancé was decidedly difficult, even if she did save Adro\nfrom a mad god.\nKa-poel dipped her head, giving a little wave.\n“Still haven’t figured out a way to talk with your sorcery?”\nKa-poel gave a tiny shrug, hands open, as if to say “what can I do?”"

At least in my experience. Besides, Ka-poel’s too tired to\ngive me a new face on such short notice and it’s worth the risk of being\nrecognized. We have to talk.”\nVlora growled under her breath. “I thought we already did that.”\n“Yeah, well, things have changed. I was hoping you’d reconsider my\noffer.”\n“It’s a bit late,” Vlora said. “The moment the Dynize arrived Lindet\noffered me a king’s ransom to become defender of Landfall. I’m in\ncommand of the entire garrison.”\nTaniel glanced out to sea nervously. “Yes, I saw that.”\n“And I’m a bit busy.” She stopped, squinting at Ka-poel. “I met my\nsecond bone-eye today. Cold bastard by the name of Ka-sedial. Stared down\nLindet like she was a common strumpet. Do you know anything about him?\nDoes he have the same kind of power you do?”\nA short, silent communication passed between Ka-poel and Taniel\nbefore her hands began to move, firing off a rapid series of gestures that\nVlora couldn’t even hope to follow. Taniel watched them carefully before\ntranslating: “Ka-sedial isn’t nearly as powerful as she is, but he’s in Lindet’s\nclass of cunning and ruthless. He’s not to be trusted.”\n“I hadn’t planned on it.” Vlora wasn’t particularly surprised that Ka-\npoel already knew who Ka-sedial was, but she made a mental note to ask\nlater exactly how she knew. Taniel and Ka-poel were just a whole box full\nof useful information. If they bothered to share it.\nThe hand gestures, and the translation, continued. “Ka-sedial knows\nthere’s a bone-eye in the city. He’s been trying to suss her out since the\nmoment he landed. He’s more experienced than she is, and it’s taking all of\nher power to hide.”\nThat, more than anything else, alarmed Vlora. Ka-poel was the strongest\nmortal sorcerer Vlora had ever encountered and she was hiding from Ka-\nsedial? Perhaps it was out of expedience more than anything else, but the\nfact that Ka-sedial was making it difficult on her did not reassure. “Is he\ngoing to cause problems?”\n“Now?” Taniel said. “Bone-eyes are not Privileged. They don’t have\naccess to fire and lightning. Their sorcery is a slow burn, a patient gathering\nof resources. If it’s a fight he wants, he won’t be any real threat today. If he"

If he\nremains in the city, he will be an immense pain in the ass.”\n“So what you’re saying is that even if we avoid a fight, and have some\npeace talks with the Dynize, he could eventually do some serious damage\nwithout his army?”\n“Pretty much.”\n“Can you counter him?” she asked Ka-poel.\nKa-poel gave another one of those shrugs. “She’ll try,” Taniel said, “but\nshe’s self-taught. Ka-sedial is a trained bone-eye with sixty years of\nexperience in blood sorcery.”\nVlora rubbed her temples. None of this was information she wanted to\nhear. But, she reflected, important intelligence doesn’t always come in the\nform of good news. She opened her mouth, only to have Taniel cut her off.\n“We’re not just here about hiring you,” he said, “or to feed you bits about\nthe Dynize. We need information. What happened with the delegation?”\nVlora was half-tempted not to tell him. He’d made it clear before that he\nhad his own agenda, and it was directly opposed to Lindet – who was, once\nagain, Vlora’s employer. “I should probably arrest you,” Vlora said.\nKa-poel pointed at her and waved her hands flat in front of her as if to\nsay “no.”\n“You’re not going to,” Taniel translated.\n“Yeah, I picked up on that.” He was right. She saw what he did to those\ndragonmen. She should be trying to get him on her side, just like she did\nwith Styke – the Dynize might be a problem for both Lindet and the Palo,\nand she needed assets against a possible invasion – but a stubborn part of\nher whispered that she didn’t need his help. She forced herself to look past\nher annoyance. “It didn’t go well. Ka-sedial came in alone and as much as\ntold Lindet that he wanted Dynize property back or he was going to take it\nby force.”\n“What kind of property?”\n“Something called the godstones. Lindet wouldn’t tell me what they are,\nbut they sound like some kind of sorcerous artifact.”\nTaniel inhaled sharply, and Ka-poel pulled her top lip back. They\nexchanged a long look, before Taniel uttered one, drawn-out word. “Shit.”\nVlora turned her attention briefly to the soldiers scurrying around in the\nfort yard below them, and the gun crews bringing powder and cannonballs\nup to the fixed guns, before turning back to Taniel. “What do you mean,\nshit?”\n“You remember those theories I told you about – why the Dynize are\nhere?”\n“Yeah, I remember you wouldn’t tell me about them,” Vlora snapped.\n“This is one of those theories,” Taniel said with a grimace. “What did\nLindet say?”\n“She told him no, but that she’d think about it.”\nKa-poel tapped her temple with one finger, shook her head, then made\nan expansive gesture. Taniel translated: “She’s not going to give them to\nKa-sedial. She’s just buying time.”\n“For what?” Vlora demanded."

She’s just buying time.”\n“For what?” Vlora demanded.\n“For you to prepare for the invasion.”\nAs much as Vlora had been fearing a Dynize landing, she didn’t\nhonestly believe that they’d actually do it. There were a thousand reasons,\nforemost among them that Fatrasta was still closely tied with the Nine. The\nfortunes of entire royal families were tied up in Fatrastan businesses and\nany war would bring the Nine into it in short order. “If the Dynize invade,\nthey’ll bring the Nine down on them. Surely their spies will have told them\nthat.”\n“They don’t care,” Taniel said. “They’re not interested in Fatrasta, just\nthe godstones. The fact Lindet isn’t handing them over means she knows\nexactly what they do, and that’s almost as terrifying as the Dynize getting\nahold of them.”\n“So,” Vlora demanded, her patience wearing thin, “what do the bloody\nthings do?”\nTaniel tilted his head to the side. “What the pit does it sound like they\ndo?”\n“I don’t know! Make gods? If I knew I wouldn’t be… asking.” The final\nword slipped out in a whisper, and Vlora found her mouth suddenly dry.\n“No. You must be joking.”\n“Have you ever wondered,” Taniel asked, “where the gods came from?”\n“I thought Kresimir made them.”\n“Where did Kresimir come from?” Taniel countered. “Where did the\nGurlish gods that our cabals murdered during the occupation forty years ago\ncome from? Gods are not born. They’re made. Dozens have come and gone\nin the history of our world. It’s not public knowledge, but the cabals know.\nThey’ve been looking for the godstones for centuries, and it just happened\nto be Lindet and her Privileged who found them.”\nVlora didn’t know what to believe. This seemed far-fetched, even for all\nthe things she’d seen in her life, but she was talking to two living, breathing\ngodkillers and all she knew was that she didn’t want to believe them. She\ntook a step backward involuntarily, sagging against a cannon. “So whoever\nhas the godstones can create a god?”\n“Do you think Lindet would trust anyone else to become a god?”\n“She wants them for herself,” Vlora breathed.\n“And Ka-sedial wants them back.”\n“For himself?”\n“Or his emperor. The Dynize civil war was sparked by the murder of\ntheir last god. The only way they ended their war was the promise to make a\nnew one.” Taniel leaned forward. “The Dynize are not motivated by greed\nor ambition. They are motivated by the desperation of dying faith, and that’s\nmore dangerous than anything else in the world.”\nVlora looked back out past the breakers, at the masts on the horizon, her\nbreath coming fast and short. “I saw what a god can do during the war. I’m\nnot letting that happen again.”\n“Agreed,” Taniel said, his face steely. Behind him, Ka-poel nodded.\n“This is why you’re here,” Vlora said, voicing a sudden realization. “It’s"

We fight for the Palo because we believe in their cause. But the\ngodstones are more important than any ethnic or political squabbles.”\nVlora couldn’t help but agree. This was bigger than her, or Lindet, or\neven the Dynize. The godstones could change the entire face of the world,\nand she feared – no, she knew that it would not be for the better. “I won’t let\nthem have them,” she said, summoning all of her inner strength to stand up\nstraight.\n“The Dynize?” Taniel asked.\n“Any of them,” Vlora responded. She headed back down to the fort\nyard, calling for her horse and an escort of two hundred men.

His mother stood beside him, silent after her initial\noutburst of questions in the first cab, staring down the hall as if shell-\nshocked. Michel finally managed to knock the rust off the lock of the\napartment and kicked the door open.\n“What is this place?” his mother asked.\n“Inside,” he said, glancing up and down the empty hall before closing\nthe door behind them.\nThe apartment was hot and stuffy, every surface coated in a thick layer\nof dust. He coughed his way through the three bedrooms and opened all the\nwindows, checking the rooms for any sign of occupancy. No one had been\nhere for a very long time.\nAbout four years if he remembered right.\n“Is this, what do the spies call it, a safe house?” his mother asked.\nMichel was surprised she knew the word, then remembered that she\nspent all day reading penny novels. “Right,” he said.\n“Is this a Blackhat place?”\nMichel barked a laugh, then shushed himself and crossed to a window\nthat overlooked Greenfire Depths. He could smell smoke, and smoke in the\nDepths was never a good thing. He stuck his head outside and listened,\nhearing the distant sound of yelling and the crash of broken glass.

But, he reasoned, it was far more dangerous to be out of the\nDepths right now. “Stay here,” he told his mother, then went up two flights\nof rickety stairs and knocked on the fourth door on the left. He waited\nseveral minutes, knocking frequently, before a suspicious-looking Palo\nwoman opened her door a crack. Michel held up a folded ten-krana note.\n“I’m a Son of the Red Hand,” he said. “I need a message taken to the\nYellow Hall immediately.”\nThe woman stared at him, stared at the krana note, then said, “There’s\nrioting down at the Yellow Hall.”\n“I know. This is important. I live two floors down in the empty\napartment.”\nShe stewed on this information for a few moments. Michel’s persona –\nhis real persona, the one that had lived in the marble in the back of his head\nall these years – was just as careful as his Blackhat one. He and Taniel had a\ndozen backup plans, including safe houses, passwords, message chains, and\nbank boxes. He didn’t remember half those plans, but he did know that he\nneeded to get word to Taniel immediately that his cover had been blown.\nWhen the woman didn’t answer, Michel pulled out another twenty\nkrana. She gave a perfunctory nod and said, “Meln-Dun’s people have taken\nhold of the Yellow Hall, but I can get a message to the Red Hand.” She\nsnatched the money, and a moment later the door opened and a small boy\nran into the hall and held out his hand expectantly.\nMichel found a nub of pencil in his pocket and scribbled a note, handing\nit to the boy, who immediately took off down the hall.\nHe returned to find his mother sitting on the dusty sofa in the corner of\nthe main room, staring at her hands. She looked up at him as he entered, a\nquestion on her lips, but remained silent. He looked out the windows one\nmore time, listening to the distant shouts. The smell of smoke was getting\nstronger, and that didn’t bode well at all. A fire in the wrong place and\nGreenfire Depths might go up entirely.\nMichel sat down on the sofa beside his mother and stared at the wall.\nHis life – the one he’d worked so hard to build the last four years – was\nover. There was a hole in his chest and he wondered if perhaps he’d gone in\ntoo deep with the Blackhats. He should be celebrating right now, ready to\nreturn to what he once was.\n“Michel…”\n“I met Taniel and Ka-poel seven years ago,” Michel said without\npreamble. He didn’t bother looking at his mother. He didn’t want to see her\nface as she realized she’d been lied to for so long. “I bluffed my way into\nsome politician’s gala in Upper Landfall and went looking around for\nsomeone to con. Taniel and Ka-poel were supposed to be my mark – I was\ngonna rob them blind. But we got to talking, and there was something\ndifferent about them.”"

But we got to talking, and there was something\ndifferent about them.”\nHe chuckled to himself, glad he’d not gone through with his plan to\nnick their wallets. Taniel would have probably turned him inside out. “Ka-\npoel saw through me right away, but instead of getting me kicked out of the\ngala they took me under their wing. They introduced me to people I had no\nright talking with, and over the course of a couple of hours I’d created a\nwhole different persona.

The\nidiots at that gala ate it up, and I left with ten thousand krana in donations to\nhelp me win back my title.\n“I found out later that my new friends weren’t who they said they were,\neither. They’d bluffed their way into the party just like I had, but they\nweren’t there for money. They were creating a network of contacts that, I\nhave to admit, were probably far more valuable to them than the ten\nthousand I left with were to me.\n“I ended up working for them – petty thievery, forgery, that sort of\nthing.” He ignored his mother’s indignant snort and continued: “It wasn’t\nlong before I figured out that they weren’t crime bosses or cons like I first\nsuspected. They were playing a longer game, a bigger one. They were\npositioning themselves to take on Lindet. They championed the Palo, and I\nliked that because, well, because of Grandpappy.”\nHe finally looked at his mother, wondering if the names Taniel and Ka-\npoel meant anything to her. Her memory tended to slip, so the chances of\nher remembering an old war hero – aside from her late husband – were\nslim. She peered at him cautiously through the dust, eyes narrowed as if\nseeing him for the first time.\n“I don’t know what you’re saying, Michel,” she finally said, “but it\nscares me.”\n“I’m saying” – Michel reached into his shirt and drew out his Gold\nRose, letting it dangle from his fingertips as he stared at it – “that before I\nbecame this, I was something else. This,” he said, bouncing the Gold Rose\nup and down by its chain, “is not me.”\n“What are you, then?”\nThere was a sudden knock on the door and Michel leapt to his feet,\ncrossing the room as quietly as he dared and putting a finger to his lips. He\napproached the front door, palming his knuckledusters, and slowly moved\nthe brass cover to the peephole to look out into the hall. He let out a soft\nsigh and stepped away from the door, pulling it open.\nTaniel and Ka-poel stood in the hallway. Taniel was himself – not\nGregious Tampo or any of the other faces he’d worn over the years – and\nKa-poel hadn’t aged a day in the years since Michel had seen her. Michel\nand Ka-poel exchanged a hug, and Taniel stalked into the room, giving it\nthe same thorough inspection that Michel had when he first entered.\n“How did you find me so quickly?” Michel asked. “I just sent a"

Michel’s mother sat silently on the couch, as\nstill as a frightened deer, eyeing the two new arrivals with something\nbetween suspicion and anger.\n“We had someone watching your mother’s home,” Taniel said. “We\nwere down at Fort Nied about an hour ago when we got the message that\nyou attacked Fidelis Jes. We checked the home first, then came here hoping\nto find you. Your cover is blown, I assume?”\nMichel nodded. “I slipped up.”\nTaniel gave a frustrated snort. “How?”\n“I tripped a ward looking for some sign of the godstones in the\nMillinery upper library. Fidelis Jes came for me at Mother’s home, and I\nwas able to get the drop on him and escape.”\nTaniel and Ka-poel exchanged a glance, and Ka-poel shrugged as if it\nwere of little consequence. Taniel seemed more annoyed. “It can’t be\nhelped, I suppose,” he said. He reached into his pocket and pulled out the\nnote Michel had left at the bank yesterday. “I haven’t gotten the chance to\ncheck this yet. Care to explain?”\nMichel quickly ran through his visit to the Millinery library and the dig\nsite south of town, and as he spoke the irritation drained from Taniel’s face\nuntil he was finally smiling.\n“So we have it?” Taniel said.\n“I think so. You’ll want to be sure. I’m not sure if it’s what you\nexpected, though. It’s huge – maybe eighty feet long; one of those big\nobelisks they dig up from time to time around the city.”\nTaniel crossed the room and sat down beside Michel’s mother, his hand\non his chin, seemingly without noticing she was there. His brow furrowed.\n“You’re right, that’s not what we expected at all.”\n“Michel.” His mother finally spoke up, her voice an octave higher than\nusual. “Who are these people?”\nMichel wiped his brow and glanced from Taniel to Ka-poel. Ka-poel\ngestured to herself, then to his mother, as if to say go ahead and introduce\nus. He hesitated for a long moment, wondering if his mother had fully\ngrasped the importance of the story he’d told her just a few minutes ago.\n“Mother, this is Taniel and Ka-poel. They’re the ones I work for.”\n“So you’re not a Blackhat?”\n“I am. Or rather, I was. I imagine Fidelis Jes is hunting for me now.”\nHis mother leaned back from Taniel, taking him in. “Who are you?” she\nasked.\nIn answer, Taniel tugged at the fingers of his glove and removed it,\nrevealing skin the color of fresh blood. His nails were long, his skin\nsmooth, and he gave her a little wave.\nMichel’s mother inhaled sharply. “The Red Hand?”\n“One and the same.”\n“He’s a revolutionary. A guerrilla fighter.”\n“So is your son, Mrs. Bravis.”"

She blinked at him, and he could\nsee the moment it all came together in her head. “You’re a double agent,”\nshe said.\n“I am.”\nShe rose from the sofa, rushing across the room and throwing her arms\naround Michel before he could stop her. She clung to him, face buried in his\nneck, and he thought perhaps she was crying. He took her in his arms and\ngently patted her back, giving Taniel an apologetic smile. “It’s okay,\nMother.”\n“You’re not a Blackhat, then. You’re a good Palo boy, fighting against\nLindet?”\n“That’s right.”\n“Why didn’t you tell me?”\n“I couldn’t.”\n“I’m your mother!”\n“That’s why I couldn’t,” Michel said. He wondered if he should explain\nabout being caught and tortured and all the risks and horrible things that\ncould have happened to both of them if she’d known his true identity and\nslipped up. But that seemed like a bit much for her now. “I’ve been\nclimbing the ranks from the beginning. Spying, informing, helping the\nBlackhats mop up the streets. A couple of years ago Taniel helped me catch\na rogue powder mage. It earned me my Silver Rose, and I’ve just been\naiming for my Gold ever since.”\n“Sorry to interrupt,” Taniel said quietly. “But we have a problem.”\nMichel slowly extricated himself from his mother’s grip and deposited\nher back on the sofa. She beamed at him, and he felt his cheeks color. “We\nhave a lot of problems. Fidelis Jes wants my head.”\n“I don’t think he’s worried about you right now. That Dynize fleet out\nbeyond the bay is threatening to attack. They want the godstones. I imagine\nall of Fidelis Jes’s efforts are heading in that direction right now.”\n“You’re joking.”\n“Not in the slightest. The Dynize want the godstones. My people tell me\nthat their agents here in the Depths are the ones stirring up the rioters. I’ve\nalready dispatched everyone I could to try to deal with them, but you, Ka-\npoel, and I are going to have to do something about that stone.”\nMichel drummed his fingers on the wall. “I’m not doing anything,” he\nsaid. “Half the Blackhats in the city will be looking for me by now. I’m\nstaying right here until I can get Mother safely out of the city. If the Dynize\nare going to attack, I don’t want to be anywhere near this place.”\n“I don’t think they are looking for you,” Taniel responded coolly. “Jes\nsurvived your little attack, I can tell you that. But with this possible\ninvasion he’ll be rushing around trying to keep the Blackhats together.\nBesides, do you really think someone with his ego will have told anyone\nthat a common spy got the drop on him? He’ll keep that close to his chest\nuntil he has the time to find you himself.”\nMichel wasn’t convinced. “Either way, I’m not a fighter.”"

He’ll keep that close to his chest\nuntil he has the time to find you himself.”\nMichel wasn’t convinced. “Either way, I’m not a fighter.”\n“No,” Taniel agreed. “You’re not. But you’ve still got your Gold Rose,\ndon’t you?”\nMichel touched the medallion under his shirt. “I’m going to get rid of it\nas quickly as I can.”\n“It might come in handy,” Taniel said.\n“It also identifies me as a Blackhat to all those rioters out there.” Michel\ncrossed to the corner of the room and folded his arms, trying to think. His\nprimary worry was getting Mother out of the city. As far as he was\nconcerned, Taniel was on his own from here on out. There was nothing\nmore Michel could do to help, not now. He looked at Ka-poel, hoping for a\nlittle help. Both of them could be inscrutable at times, but Michel had\nalways liked Ka-poel. She had a fantastic sense of humor.\nKa-poel fired off a rapid series of gestures at Taniel, and it took Michel\na few moments to translate them in his head.\nWe need that stone, Ka-poel gestured.\n“I know,” Taniel said glumly.\nIf the Dynize manage to get it, that might be worse than letting Lindet\nkeep it.\n“I don’t think we have a choice but to let them fight over it,” Taniel\nresponded. “We weren’t ready for it to be that big.”\nWe have to figure out something.\n“Sure. But what are we going to do with eighty feet of solid rock? We\ncan’t just go down and steal it.”\nMichel pushed himself away from the wall and went to his mother’s\nside, kneeling down beside the sofa. She was rocking back and forth gently,\nmuttering to herself in Palo. “Are you all right?” he asked.\n“All my books,” she said mournfully.\nMichel almost laughed out loud. The city was burning down around\nthem, their whole world going to shit, and Mother could only think of the\nbooks she’d left behind at her house. He leaned over and kissed her gently\non the forehead. “I’ll get you out of the city, and then I’ll buy you more. I\npromise.”\n“Can we even get out of here?” she asked. “Is it safe to get out through\nthe riots and the Blackhats?”\nProbably not, he said silently to himself. “We may have to hold tight for\na while and risk the smoke. But I’ll get you out.” He bit one knuckle,\nscowling at himself, trying to think of something. If he risked a Blackhat\ncontact, on the assumption that Taniel was right and Jes had not spread\nword of his betrayal, he might be able to smuggle them both out of the city\nbefore nightfall. But that was not a risk he was willing to take.\n“Wait,” he said, looking up at Taniel and Ka-poel. “What did you just\nsay?”\n“We’re just trying to agree on a plan,” Taniel responded.\n“No. A moment ago,” Michel said. “You said you couldn’t just go down\nthere and steal the godstone.”\nKa-poel cocked her head."

We’d want armed\nguards, barges, tow cables; the lot.” He thought furiously, remembering\nwhat Professor Cressel had told him – that they’d be ready to move the\nobelisk within days.\nTaniel exchanged a glance with Ka-poel. “It would be tight, but I think I\ncould manage.”\nMichel took Taniel by the arm and nudged him toward the door. They\nstepped out into the hall, where the smoke was somehow even worse.\nMichel thought he heard a scream in the distance. “Could you get my\nmother out of the city? Immediately?”\n“Certainly,” Taniel said slowly.\nMichel bit his lip. He had an idea. It was wild, insane, and more than a\nlittle bit stupid. But it just might work. “Okay,” he said. “Get Mother out of\nthe city and have your people ready with barges upriver. Do that, and we\nmight just be able to steal the stone after all. Is that a deal?”\n“So you’re with me?”\n“I’ll have to be,” Michel said. And it didn’t make him happy at all. He\nstepped back inside. “We’re going to get you out, Mother,” he announced.\n“But you’ve got to go now.”\n“Michel,” his mother said, a worried note in her voice, “aren’t you\ncoming with me?”\nMichel gave his mother a hug. “Not yet. But we’ll send you out with\nfriends, and once this whole thing is over I’ll come find you.” He stifled her\nprotests with another hug, then pulled her out into the hallway with him,\nlinking her arm forcefully with Taniel’s, while Taniel gave him a bemused\nlook. “Time to go,” he said to his mother. “I’ll come find you, I promise.”\nOver his mother’s head he mouthed the words, Get her out of here and meet\nme outside.\nFifteen minutes later Taniel arrived in the street just outside of Michel’s\nsafe house tenement. Ka-poel stood on her tiptoes, eyes fixed on the end of\nthe street. There was definitely screaming in the distance, and the smoke\nwas so thick that a fire had to have caught several nearby tenements. It was\ngoing to spread fast, and he worried about everyone trying to get out of the\nDepths at once.\n“All right,” Taniel said. “Your mother’s on her way. Now, what’s your\nplan?”\n“My plan,” Michel responded, hoping he sounded more optimistic than\nhe felt, “is to hope that Professor Cressel is ready to move the godstone. If\nhe is, we’re going to commandeer the damn thing.”\nCHAPTER 54\nO\nlem caught up to her by the time Vlora’s escort had plowed through the\nafternoon press and returned her to the capitol building.

He rode up,\ncatching her by the sleeve as she prepared to dismount.\n“Let go,” Vlora said, tugging off her riding gloves. “Norrine, Davd.\nTake vantages on the north and south points of the plaza.” She watched the\ntwo powder mages dismount, rifles in hand, and disappear into the crowd.\nOlem leaned over to her and in a low voice said, “I saw Taniel. You\nweren’t kidding about the Red Hand. He said you were about to do\nsomething stupid. What’s going on?”\n“I’m about to do something necessary,” Vlora responded, jerking her\nsleeve out of his grip and dismounting, handing the reins to a private. Olem\nwas beside her in a moment, matching her pace as she strode up the capitol\nbuilding stairs. People in the street stopped and stared, no doubt whispering\nover why an entire company of Riflejacks had just arrived on Lindet’s\ndoorstep. Vlora didn’t care what people thought was happening.\n“Vlora…” Olem said in warning as they neared the doors. Blackhats on\nthe top of the steps eyed her and her men nervously.\n“No, Olem,” Vlora responded. “I need you to trust me on this. It’s\nimportant. I’ll explain later, but this…” She couldn’t find the words to\nexpress herself. What Taniel said echoed in her mind: Gods aren’t born.\nThey’re made. She’d seen what happened when gods involved themselves\nin a modern world, and she wasn’t letting it happen again. She brushed past\nthe Blackhats on the top step and strode down the halls of the capitol\nbuilding with three squads accompanying her. They reached Lindet’s office,\nand Vlora turned one last time to Olem. “Tell me you’re behind me on this.”\n“I’m not sure what this is,” Olem replied, clearly unhappy. She braced\nherself for a fight, but he just nodded. “I’m with you.”\n“Bar the door,” Vlora said. “Don’t let any Blackhats inside.”\nThe secretary outside Lindet’s office tried to stop her, but Vlora strode\nthrough the antechamber and into Lindet’s main room, where she found\nLindet sitting on the front corner of her desk, listening while a dozen\nadvisers all tried to speak at once. No one seemed to notice Vlora’s arrival\nuntil she took a deep breath and, in her best officer’s voice, bellowed,\n“Everyone out!”\nThe room fell silent, and twenty-some sets of eyes turned to stare at her.\nNo one moved.\n“Now!” she roared.\nLindet’s staff fled the room, and within moments Vlora was alone with\nLindet. The Lady Chancellor wore an irritated expression. “You’d better\nhave a very good reason for this, General,” Lindet said in a flat tone. Her\neyes fell to the pistol and sword at Vlora’s belt, then back up to her face.\n“Very,” Vlora said, crossing to the window and looking briefly down\ninto the street.

    "text": "“Very,” Vlora said, crossing to the window and looking briefly down\ninto the street. She could see the front steps and her soldiers standing at\nattention nearby. A squad of Blackhats had arrived and was arguing with\nMajor Donevin. Across the street, Vlora saw a curtain flutter in a second-\nstory window. There was a Privileged over there, well hidden from Vlora’s\nsight. But not well enough.\nShe took a deep breath, reminding herself that this didn’t need to\nescalate. This could all be solved very easily, very amicably. She just\nneeded to communicate. “I would like to know what you’re doing with the\ngodstones,” Vlora said.\n“I don’t answer to you,” Lindet said, not moving from her spot at the\nedge of her desk. Her fingers drummed on the ironwood top.\n“Let me rephrase that,” Vlora said. “The godstones. I know what they\nare. I know you have them, and I know that you know what they are as well.\nWhat do you intend to use them for?”\n“You’ve become very learned in the last two hours, Lady Flint. I\nwonder how.”\n“Don’t dodge the question.”\nLindet blinked several times. Vlora wondered how long it had been\nsince someone took that tone with her – and what horrible fate had befallen\nthem. “Who said I intend to use them at all?” Lindet asked.\nVlora felt a cold bead of sweat trickle down her spine and resisted the\nurge to rub it away. She did a circuit of the room, trying to walk away her\nown nerves, then stopped and took a sniff of powder. Lindet’s eyes followed\nher the whole time.\n“General, I assume you’ve considered the consequences of this\noutburst? I am your employer.”\n“I don’t really give a damn, Lady Chancellor.” Vlora stopped, turning to\nface Lindet. “We’re talking about making gods. Do you really think a\ncontract even crosses my mind on something as serious as this?”\n“It should.”\n“Why?”\n“Because you’re treading very thin ice.” Lindet’s voice grew\ndangerously quiet. “I put you in an important place because I believe in\nyour capabilities. Do you think I don’t have plans to remove any person that\nI hand power to?”\n“I believe you have plenty of plans,” Vlora said. “That’s what scares\nme. The godstones, where are they?”\n“That’s privileged information.”\nVlora slammed a fist against the wood paneling on the office wall,\nmaking the wall rattle. “I don’t give a shit! You have no idea what you’re\nplaying with. The Dynize just dropped an entire fleet in our laps because\nthey want the godstones so badly, and you act as if they are of no\nconsequence? I know what they do. That kind of power should not be\nhanded over to anyone – nor kept.”\nLindet rounded to the other side of her desk, her movements slow and\nsmooth. She raised her hands as if to show she wasn’t armed, then lowered\nherself into her chair. Vlora had never before occupied a room with an\nunarmed, not sorcerously gifted person who could make her feel like she\ndidn’t have the upper hand, and it infuriated her."

My Privileged tell me that\nthey could study it for a dozen lifetimes and still not know all it has to offer.\nAnd you’d ask me to destroy it?”\n“Yes,” Vlora said.\n“That, my dear general, is not happening.”\n“You’d risk it falling into the hands of the Dynize? Of a blood sorcerer\nand his hungry fleet?”\n“That’s why I hired you, in case you’ve forgotten.”\nVlora wanted to spit. Lindet kept coming back to their relationship, as if\na financial arrangement meant anything to Vlora. Perhaps Lindet didn’t\nreally grasp what Vlora had seen and experienced during the Adran-Kez\nWar. Perhaps she didn’t care. Perhaps Lindet’s world was about contracts\nand control, and she just couldn’t fathom anything outside those parameters.\n“And if I fail?”\n“I’ll consider destroying it as a last resort.”\n“You’d sacrifice the lives of my men and your whole garrison to keep\nthis thing? Destroy it, and the Dynize have no reason to invade.”\nLindet leaned across the desk, her eyes dancing with an otherworldly\nlight. “I would sacrifice a million men to be a god, General. As would you.\nAs would anyone in their right mind.”\nVlora stared at Lindet, her frustration and anger turning to cold terror.\nThis was not what she’d signed on for. She did not want this responsibility\nor this fight. But it was hers, if only because no one else would take it on.\n“I’ve met gods, and you’re very wrong about that,” Vlora said. She looked\ndown, realizing that she was still wearing the parade uniform that she’d put\non for the meeting with the Dynize ambassador. She tore off the strips of\nmedals, one at a time, throwing them on Lindet’s desk. “Lady Chancellor\nLindet, as appointed defender of Fatrasta, I arrest you as a danger to the\nfuture of the country.”\nLindet had the gall to actually look shocked. “You can’t.”\n“I just did.”\n“I am Fatrasta.”\n“No. You’re the steward of this country. You have responsibilities.”\n“Don’t talk to me about responsibilities,” Lindet snapped. “You bloody,\nungrateful traitor. Guards!”\nThere was a brief scuffle outside, and then Olem stuck his head in the\ndoor. “Everything going well?” he asked.\n“I’m arresting the Lady Chancellor.”\nOlem swallowed. “Right. Well, I guess that’s happening.” He retreated\nin the hall, where there was the sound of a further scuffle, then silence."

Her stomach flipped\naround, her guts tying themselves in knots. This was political suicide, and\nmaybe more. She was conducting a coup. She could hear little but the\nhammering of her heart.\nLindet lifted her hand, and Vlora leapt forward. “Nuh-uh,” she said\nwarningly. “Give a signal and your Privileged die. I’m not so impulsive that\nI don’t check the room when I enter, and I’m not the only powder mage in\nthis city.” Out across the rooftops she could sense Norrine and Davd hidden\nfrom prying eyes, weapons trained on Lindet’s unseen bodyguards.\n“I see,” Lindet said, slowly lowering her hand. Her eyes narrowed.\n“You’re making an immense mistake.”\nVlora felt an overwhelming sadness take her, an exhaustion as if the\nweight of a mountain had just been pressed onto her shoulders. “I’ve made\na lot of big mistakes, Lindet. This isn’t one of them.” She tilted her head,\nlistening to a sudden chorus of shouts from out in the hall. A moment later\nOlem put his head back in the room.\n“We’ve got a problem,” he said.\n“What is it?” Vlora asked, keeping one eye on Lindet.\n“The Dynize have launched longboats.”\n“How many?”\nOlem held up a finger, tilting his head. Half a second later, Vlora heard\nit, too. A distant, muffled thumping. Boom. Boom-boom. Boom. Vlora knew\nthat sound well, unmistakable to any veteran officer. That was the music of\na bombardment.\n“All of them,” Olem said. “It’s a full-scale invasion.”\nLindet lifted her chin, closing her eyes and taking a deep breath. “They\ndidn’t buy my gamble for time.”\n“It doesn’t seem that way, does it?” Vlora responded. Her mind ran\nthrough a hundred scenarios as she tried to figure out what to do. She’d\nthrown herself into a fire trying to arrest Lindet, only to realize the fire was\non a sinking ship.\n“I think,” Lindet said carefully, “that keeping the godstone out of\nDynize hands is the most important thing we can do today.”\n“What, and forget this ever happened?” Vlora demanded.\n“Oh, no. I never forget this kind of thing,” Lindet responded coldly.\n“But I can overlook it until a future time. Why don’t we finish this\nconversation after a foreign empire tries to kill us?”\nVlora considered the implications. She had Lindet right now. She\nshould throw her in a cell. But doing so would have Fidelis Jes and the\nBlackhats breathing down her neck within hours. Lindet would be a\nformidable enemy once this was over – but Vlora needed an ally more than\nshe feared the future consequences. “I agree,” she said. “I’ll need supplies\nand backup troops. Arm your Blackhats and send your Privileged to the\ncoast. All of them.”"

For now, we’ve got an\ninvasion to stop.”\nCHAPTER 55\nV\nlora and Olem made it back to Fort Nied among a heavy bombardment\nof straight shot from the distant Dynize fleet. Cannon fire pounded the\neastern slope of the Landfall Plateau, the blasts striking streets and\nbuildings at random, forcing her and her men to shove their way through\ncrowds of fleeing pedestrians, carriages, and carts. It was utter chaos as\nsome sought the safety of the plateau, and others fled downhill toward the\ndocks.\nEveryone had turned out in their weekend best to gaze at the Dynize\nfleet and await news of the negotiations. No one expected a bombardment,\nand it showed in the terror of the faces of those running, fighting, or crying\nover the dead and wounded.\nVlora entered the fort, shouting over the whistle and impact detonations\nof the bombardment. “All guns open fire! Crews six and seven, sink that\nfrigate off the point of the bay. Crews eight through eleven, load grapeshot\nand sweep the waters in front of the docks. I don’t want any of their men\ngetting close enough to torch the merchantmen at moor. The rest of you\nfocus your fire on that ship of the line right off the southeastern star. Those\nships will be inaccurate as pit but if they manage to get too close they’ll be\nable to blast us to oblivion.”\nShe took a deep breath, letting her senses soak in the sorcery woven\nthroughout the walls of the fort. Fort Nied had survived the Battle of\nLandfall, holding out against the might of the Kez fleet. Its protective\nsorcery could shrug off a pit of a shelling, but she had no idea for how long.\nShe jogged up the stairs to the top of the eastern wall, gazing first out\nover the bay, then toward the open ocean, where puffs of smoke rose at\nregular intervals from every ship in the Dynize fleet. The fire was not\nfocused – straight shot appeared to be landing everywhere from the\nindustrial quarter all the way to the northern marshes – but Vlora doubted\nthe Dynize cared. As far as she could tell, the sudden bombardment had a\nsingle purpose: to provide cover for the hundreds of approaching longboats\nby sowing chaos in Landfall.\n“Where’s Taniel?” she demanded of a nearby sergeant.\n“Who?” the sergeant asked, looking confused.\n“Damn it, nobody even knows…” She grunted in frustration, looking\naround, casting out her senses for another powder mage or a blood sorcerer.\nShe found only her own three mages and nothing else. “So much for getting"

They were each loaded\nwith sixty or more Dynize soldiers, rowing hard for land, looking\nundeterred by the choppy waters that served to foul the aim of their capital\nships. They would begin to land within fifteen minutes, and then it would\nbe anyone’s guess what happened next.\nA brief terror seized her as she sought her memories and training. No\none knew how the Dynize fought. Any engagements would have been more\nthan a hundred years ago, fighting with wheel locks and early flintlocks.\nShe didn’t know if they fired in a line, preferred mass charges, or planned\non simply bullying their way into a foothold by brute strength.\n“Olem!” she shouted, waving to him from across the length of the fort\nwall. Olem raised his eyes, then ducked as a cannonball smashed into the\ntop of the wall, ricocheting skyward with enough force to carry it over the\nentire fort and drop harmlessly into the bay. Olem ran toward her in a\ncrouch. She grabbed him by the shirt, pulling him close enough to shout in\nhis ear over the thunder of her own guns returning fire. “Those longboats\nare heading toward the north side of the bay. Who do we have out there?”\n“Four thousand members of the garrison, and three companies of our\nown boys.”\nVlora raised her head, looking out at the longboats. She took a sniff of\npowder, heightening her senses, peering at the Dynize soldiers and willing\nherself to read their strategy.\nShe’d never seen soldiers armed quite like this – outside of mannequins\nin a museum. They wore bright teal coats beneath angled, heavy-looking\nbreastplates and folded steel helms. Their faces were stoic and hard, teeth\nclenched in gritty determination as they rowed closer and closer to land. A\nblast of grapeshot tore through one of the longboats, killing a third of the\nrowers and immediately causing the aft to dip into the water. The soldiers in\nthe nearest boat threw lines to their bailing companions to try to keep them\nafloat in their heavy armor, but kept rowing hard for shore.\nTheir muskets looked mass-produced, each of them with the same\nflared, engraved stock a dozen decades out of fashion in the Nine. Vlora\ncouldn’t see enough detail to examine the flintlock mechanisms, but to her\neye they looked just as modern as those of her men.\n“Down!” Olem suddenly shouted, grabbing her by the shoulder and\nshoving them both to the ground behind the protection of the wall. Vlora’s\nsorcerous senses flared, and a half a second later fire swept the top of the\nwall in a hot, angry column that scattered and charred two gun crews.\n“Privileged!” someone shouted.\nVlora got to her feet, peering over the top of the wall, opening her third\neye. She found the Privileged within moments – a woman, standing in the\nprow of one of the longboats about a quarter of a mile out from the\nshoreline.

Her gloved hands waved over her head, fingers twitching and\narms rising and falling like she was directing an opera.\nFire slammed into the north side of Fort Nied with the strength of a\ndozen cannonballs, engulfing crew eleven entirely. The Privileged suddenly\njerked and toppled onto the soldiers behind her, crimson blossoming on her\nforehead. Farther down the wall, Vlora saw Norrine lower her rifle, blowing\nsmoke from the end and immediately reloading. Vlora gave her an\nappreciative nod.\n“There’s more!” Norrine shouted.\nVlora sensed them, too. At least twenty Privileged, all of them out\nscattered among the longboats. Some of them were harder to get a fix on –\nobviously hiding themselves in the Else – while others seemed to note their\nfallen comrade and began to surround themselves with walls of hardened\nair.\n“Olem, how many Privileged does the garrison have?”\n“Two.”\n“Two?” Vlora demanded. “What good is two Privileged going to do\nagainst that?”\n“We do have powder mages,” Olem responded, gesturing to Norrine.\n“Yeah, four of us. They have a whole bloody fleet. Send a message to\nLindet. Tell her we need her personal cabal down here now or this fight\nmight not last the evening.”\nAs if to emphasize her point, there was a chorus of screams from the\nmainland as shards of ice appeared over the marketplace at the mouth of the\nHadshaw, raining down among the civilians there. Vlora swore, turning to\nlook back toward the longboats approaching the end of the bay. “Take Davd\nand an extra company. Reinforce the garrison out on the point. Tell Davd to\nfocus his fire on the Privileged. Go!”\nVlora watched Olem spring down the stairs into the muster yard. He\ngrabbed Davd from his spot at a gun port and within the minute he and a\ncompany of Riflejacks raced on foot down the causeway connecting Fort\nNied to the land.\nVlora snatched the arm of a messenger. “Get replacement gun crews up\nhere, and make sure one of our Knacked engineers is keeping an eye on the\nsorcery in these walls. I don’t want the nasty surprise of their Privileged\nsuddenly punching through this rock.”\n“Yes, ma’am!”\nWith her back to the wall, she lifted herself up to look sidelong out at\nthe approaching longboats. The Privileged were gradually coming within\nrange, raining sorcery down on the fort and bay. They, like the ships they\nwere coming from, would get more accurate as they drew closer. She took a\ndeep breath and reached out with her senses. Farther, farther, and yet farther\nstill, stretching out over a thousand yards to one of the longboats with a\nPrivileged on the prow.\nWith a thought, she detonated the powder of all the soldiers in the\nlongboat. It exploded in a hundred smaller detonations, tossing flesh and\nwood for fifty yards in all directions. She felt the kickback from triggering\npowder deep in her bones, rattling her as if she was standing near the\nexplosions.\nIt was an effective way to destroy a longboat, but she couldn’t keep it"

Major Gustar and Ibana rode on either\nside of him – Ibana keeping her head tilted to one side, listening through her\none good ear as Gustar gave Styke a rundown on his new command.\nStyke only half-listened, his eyelids drooping as a full night’s ride to\nJedwar and back threatened to topple him from his saddle. His legs were\npractically numb now, and he gripped his saddle horn to remain steady,\nlaying a calming hand on Amrec’s neck. Behind him in the saddle, Celine\ndozed peacefully, her arms wrapped around Styke’s stomach.\nGustar suddenly fell silent, and Styke looked up to find Ibana nodding\nto the road in front of him. He felt an involuntary twitch at the corner of his\nlip.\nBlackhats. At least two hundred of them.\nThe Blackhats were heavily armed with blunderbusses and muskets.\nAbout half of them marched, the other half on horseback, with three heavy\nwagons among them. Styke looked over his shoulder at Jackal and jerked\nhis head. Jackal grinned and rode past him.\n“We going to call a halt?” Gustar asked.\n“We don’t halt for them,” Ibana said, a note of disgust in her voice.\nThe column continued on as Jackal rode on ahead, reaching the\nBlackhats a hundred yards or so out. Styke could see one of the Blackhats\nlook up at the banner, look back at Jackal, then take a good, hard gander at\nthe approaching cavalry. He shouted something over his shoulder and\nslowly the Blackhats cleared the road.\nBy the time Styke reached the Blackhats they were waiting by the ditch,\nstaring daggers at Styke and the banner that flew above Jackal’s head. Styke\ndirected Amrec off the side of the road, letting the rest of the column\ncontinue on as he approached the Blackhat with a Silver Rose dangling\nfrom his neck.\n“You know who I am?” Styke asked.\nThe Silver Rose raised his chin in defiance. “Pretty good idea.” He put\non a good face, but Styke could see the fear in his eyes.\n“Good. What are your orders?”\n“None of your damn business.”\n“What are your orders regarding me?” Styke reframed the question.\nStyke could see the “Sod off” on the tip of the Silver Rose’s tongue, but\na glance at the column of cavalry and he seemed to think better of it."

Bigger problems, it seems.”\n“Well,” Styke responded, “glad your asshole of a boss can find\nsomething better to obsess over.” He turned Amrec around and headed back\ntoward the front of his column.\nBehind him, the Silver Rose shouted out, “You have the road, lancer!\nBut the grand master wants you to know this isn’t over.”\n“No,” Styke muttered to himself. “It isn’t.”\nHe caught back up with Ibana, blinking the sleep out of his eyes,\nresisting the urge to turn around and ride the Blackhats down. “Where are\nthey going?” she asked.\n“Didn’t ask.”\n“Might have been a good idea.”\nStyke made a sour face. “They’re Blackhats. They can go right to the pit\nfor all I care.”\nThe road carried them toward the distant Landfall Plateau, taking them\nover numberless marsh-fed rivers draining into the ocean and then up onto a\nrocky outcropping with thirty-foot cliffs plunging steep into the sea. They\nreached the top of these cliffs and Gustar suddenly turned over his shoulder,\ncalling for a halt.\nIbana’s head jerked around toward him. “Only the colonel calls a halt,”\nshe snapped.\nGustar ignored her. “Do you hear that?”\n“Hear what?”\nGustar produced a looking glass, raising it to one eye and gazing toward\nthe Landfall Plateau. He scanned the horizon, while Styke shared a puzzled\nglance with Ibana and strained to hear anything.\nThen he caught it. The distant but unmistakable report of cannon fire.\nGustar thrust the looking glass at Styke. “To the east of Landfall,” he\nsaid.\nStyke let his eye focus, holding his hands steady to find the ships out\nbeyond the harbor. Gray plumes of smoke rose above their gunports. He\nlowered the looking glass, wiped the eyepiece on his sleeve, then raised it\nagain. The Dynize were definitely shelling the city. He’d expected to return\nwith a thousand cavalry as part of a show of force. Not to defend Landfall.\n“We’re under attack,” he reported.\n“That’s insane,” Ibana said. “They’re supposed to have a diplomatic\nmeeting today.”\n“It must have gone wrong,” Gustar observed.\n“Really damned bloody wrong,” Styke said. He swept the horizon with\nthe looking glass, taking in the full size of the fleet and the hundreds of\nlongboats in the water between the ships and the shore. “Fort Nied is\nreturning fire, and the Dynize are landing troops. Tell everyone we’re in for\na hard ride.”\nHe heard Ibana shift in her saddle. “We’ve ridden all afternoon. Our\nmen and horses are tired. Pit, the lancers rode all night, too.”\n“We’ve ridden all night to a fight before,” Styke said.\n“Yeah, when we were all ten years younger. We’re old, fat, and out of\nshape.

    "text": "“Yeah, when we were all ten years younger. We’re old, fat, and out of\nshape. At least the rest of you are, anyway.”\nStyke was about to lower the glass when he spotted something else:\nmore ships, far to the north of where the fleet had engaged with Fort Nied.\nThere were at least a dozen transports emptying their decks of longboats,\nwhich plowed across the shallows to disgorge their troops with alarming\nswiftness. Styke quickly examined the lay of the land out from the beach –\nmarshes and streams, with the odd village, and flat, drained suburbs at the\nbase of the plateau.\nHe spotted a brigade in dark yellow jackets marching out of the suburbs,\nheading double-time for the landing Dynize. At a glance, the Dynize\nalready outnumbered them and with the heavy armor they wore they looked\nmore than an even match for basic garrison troops.\n“Major Gustar, how do you feel about charging across sand?” he asked.\n“Depends on the kind of sand,” Gustar responded.\n“I don’t think you’re going to get the chance to check.” Styke handed\nthe looking glass back and Gustar put it to his eye.\nHe frowned, and seemed to come to the same conclusion Styke had.\n“The garrison is badly outmatched. My cuirassiers will sink in that sand,\nbut the dragoons might have a chance. You want me to hit them from\nbehind?”\nStyke grunted an affirmative and gently woke Celine, who rubbed her\neyes and peered toward the distant enemies. “Sunin,” Styke called.\nHe was joined by Major Sunintiel, her crooked yellow teeth framed in a\nbroad grin. “Ordering a charge, Colonel? Been forever since I killed a man\nin battle, you know?” Sunin was old enough to be his great-grandmother,\nbut looks were deceiving. She’d always been one of his meanest lancers –\nwhich didn’t mean she’d survive the shock of a charge at her age.\n“I am,” Styke said, “but you’re not in it. Take Celine.”\n“I’m not a nursemaid,” Sunin objected.\n“You can also barely hold a lance.”\n“Not true!”\nIbana snorted. “You’re about a thousand years old, Sunin. Keep the girl\nsafe.”\nSunin grumbled, but she directed her horse up beside Styke. He took\nCeline by the back of the shirt, lifting and depositing her in front of Sunin.\n“Will you be all right?” Celine asked.\n“Me?” Styke let Amrec prance below him. “I’ll be fine. You take care of\nyourself. This is going to get bloody.” He turned away from her. “Gustar,\ntake your dragoons and sweep the beach. Ibana, draw up the Mad Lancers\nand the Riflejack cuirassiers on the road. We have killing to do.”\nCHAPTER 57\nM\nichel, Taniel, and Ka-poel were forced to approach the dig site by\nhorse, as the streets in and out of the city were all but impassable to\ncabs with pedestrians in a panic and the roads clogged by families and\nmerchants fleeing the city.

News that the Landfall bay was under attack by a\nDynize fleet spread rapidly, and with it chaos.\nThey left the western plateau, forcing their way through the press of the\nindustrial quarter, cutting across streams, parks, and yards, before finally\nrejoining the main highway just outside the city. It was a fraught ride, and\nMichel, who rarely, if ever, rode, felt like he was going to tumble from his\nsaddle at any moment. His fear was only made worse when Ka-poel\nsnatched his reins from him and led his horse in a gallop across the open\nfloodplains.\nHe was only given a reprieve when they finally drew near the dig site\nand the three of them stopped a few hundred yards away, staring out across\nthe farms at the cordoned-off, innocuous-looking excavation.\nTaniel scowled in the direction of the monolith. Ka-poel raised her nose\nto the wind, as if trying to smell for something other than the smoke coming\noff Greenfire Depths. Michel, for his part, tried not to be sick from their\nride and occupied himself with wondering what the other two were seeing.\nHe’d read a little about sorcery – it would be stupid to be a spy and not\nbe aware of the ways he could be detected. But sorcery was as foreign to\nhim as Gurla or Dynize, a distant concept that never really affected him in\nany significant way until he tripped those wards on the upper library and\ntipped his hand to Fidelis Jes. He thought of sorcery like he did politics: He\nknew it existed, and that it affected his life in deep, intrinsic ways, but he\ntried his best not to get any on him.\nYet here he was, leading a pair of godkillers to something that, if they\nwere right, could actually create gods.\nHe lost his battle with his motion sickness, leaning over his saddle and\nvomiting noisily in the cotton field. Neither of his companions seemed to\nnotice.\nTaniel spoke up, his eyes still on the dig site, looking pensive and\nperplexed. “I wondered how it could have remained unnoticed for so long\njust outside the city, but even at this distance I can barely sense it.” He\nglanced at Michel. “You’re certain this is it?”\n“I’m certain,” Michel answered, spitting out the taste of sick and wiping\nhis mouth. “I can’t feel sorcery and that thing whispered in my head. I’ve\nnever heard of anything that could do that. And even if I wasn’t certain\nbefore, Fidelis Jes confirmed it this morning. They’re digging up the\ngodstone.”\nKa-poel clicked her tongue to get Taniel’s attention, then went through a\nseries of hand motions too quickly for Michel to follow. Taniel watched\ncarefully, nodding along. “What’s going on over there?” he asked, pointing.\nMichel followed his finger to see that part of the palisade surrounding\nthe dig site had been torn down, and that hundreds of horses were being\ncorralled by their handlers. Some sort of massive undertaking was under\nway, and it didn’t take much for Michel to guess what.\n“They’re getting ready to move it,” he said. “The professor in charge,"

Some sort of massive undertaking was under\nway, and it didn’t take much for Michel to guess what.\n“They’re getting ready to move it,” he said. “The professor in charge,\nCressel, said they’d be ready within days. That was yesterday.”\nKa-poel gestured quickly, and Taniel translated, “The arrival of the\nDynize must have moved up their plans.”\n“Agreed,” Michel said, though he wondered why he bothered. This\nwasn’t his territory anymore. Taniel and Ka-poel were in charge, and he\nwould let them have it.\nTaniel removed a snuff box from his pocket and tapped a line of black\npowder out on the back of his hand before snorting it. He rubbed his nose\nand squinted toward the dig site. “There’s a couple of Knacked down\nthere,” he said. “They’ll be able to sense something off about Ka-poel. No\ntelling how they’ll react. They can’t sense a powder mage, though.”\n“Any Privileged?” Michel asked, fearing the answer.\n“None,” Taniel said. “We actually passed one on our ride down here,\nbeelining for the city. Probably recalled because of the attack.”\nMichel let out a sigh of relief. “Okay, so nothing down there but\nlaborers, soldiers, and normal Blackhats. Right. This should be fine. Easy.\nNo problem. We’ve got this. Can’t think of a single thing that will go\nwrong. Just the easiest thing we’ve ever…” He trailed off when he noticed\nthat both Ka-poel and Taniel were staring at him. “What?” he asked.\n“You all right?” Taniel responded.\n“I’m nervous.”\n“You’ll do fine.”\nKa-poel reached over and patted Michel on the shoulder, and he tried\nnot to imagine that he was nothing more than a pet to these two. “Look,”\nMichel said, “you two can fight your way out if this goes poorly. Me? I’m\nstuck.”\nTaniel reached over and slapped Michel on the back, almost knocking\nhim out of his saddle. “We won’t leave you behind.”\n“Thanks,” he said, feeling less than reassured. He knew how this needed\nto go, and realized that he wasn’t going to be able to cede control – and\nresponsibility – over to Taniel. “Okay, let’s get this over with. Ride behind\nme, and pretend I’m in charge.”\n“You’re the boss,” Taniel said.\n“That’s the worst thing you could say right now.” Taking a deep breath,\nMichel headed toward the dig site.\nMichel was met by the soldiers guarding the dig site about a hundred feet\nfrom the palisade. They looked tired and more than a little harried, casting\nglances toward the smoke rising above both the eastern and western ends of\nthe Landfall Plateau. Michel didn’t give them a chance to speak, drawing\nhimself up in his saddle and pulling the Gold Rose out of his shirt, dangling\nit haughtily. “I’m looking for Major Cole,” he said.\nThere were six of the guards, led by a sergeant, who immediately\ntouched her cap at the sight of the Gold Rose. “Sir,” she said, “Major Cole\nis overseeing the move, sir.”"

Take me to him!”\nThe sergeant glanced hesitantly at Taniel and Ka-poel before nodding.\n“Right this way, sir.”\nThe dig site seemed to have transformed overnight. The wooden\nbuildings had been ripped down, half of the tents were gone, and, with the\nexception of Professor Cressel, whom Michel immediately spotted\nscurrying around the lip of the excavation site, Michel didn’t see anyone\nelse who looked like they were from the college. This was no longer a dig,\nit seemed, but a military matter.\nSoldiers and laborers swarmed the area, and several immense cranes\nhad been erected to the north of the monolith, which itself was freestanding,\nthe scaffolding removed, but now looped with hundreds of thick ropes of\nthe kind they used to moor the biggest ships in port. To the north, positioned\njust beyond the two cranes, was the biggest wagon Michel had ever seen.\nCalling it a wagon might have been an understatement. It was at least\neighty feet long, with more sets of thick, wooden wheels than Michel could\ncount, and hundreds of horses being led into position beyond it. The word\n“land-barge” immediately came to mind, and Michel had never seen\nanything like it.\n“It sure is something, isn’t it?”\nThe voice brought Michel out of his sense of wonder, and he looked\ndown to see Major Cole standing beside his horse. “Back already, sir?” the\nmajor asked pleasantly.\nThe knot of stress between Michel’s shoulders loosened ever so slightly.\nApparently word of his treachery, or his attack on Fidelis Jes this morning,\nhad yet to spread this far out. “It’s quite the operation,” he admitted,\nclimbing down from his horse with less grace than he would have liked. He\nwas quickly joined by Taniel and Ka-poel, the latter of whom Cole looked\nat with curious suspicion.\nMichel pretended like they didn’t exist and took on his most\nauthoritative air. “You’re really able to move this?”\n“Professor Cressel has actually moved several monoliths this size or\nbigger,” Cole said, pointing to the balding professor as he ran between\ncranes, pit, and labor foremen shouting for everyone to be careful. “He\nclaims it’s really quite simple – just a matter of levers and manpower. We\nhave orders to get it moving by this afternoon, so only speed is going to be\nan issue now.”\n“But you can do it?” Michel asked.\n“Landfall sent us four hundred more men, and Cressel says that’ll do the\ntrick.”\n“Good, good,” Michel said. As he watched, there was a sudden shout,\nand the top of the monolith wobbled. Michel’s heart leapt into his throat at\nthe sight of something so solid and immense moving, and then it tipped\nwithout warning, falling several feet and causing him to gasp, before it\ncame to a sudden stop at a sharp angle. Michel squeezed his eyes closed\nagainst a sharp pain, like nails on a chalkboard inside his head. “Kresimir,”\nhe swore, “that’s insane.”"

Michel squeezed his eyes closed\nagainst a sharp pain, like nails on a chalkboard inside his head. “Kresimir,”\nhe swore, “that’s insane.”\nCole seemed less impressed. “I thought so, too. Are you all right?”\nThe pain was gone as suddenly as it arrived, and Michel couldn’t help\nbut stare at the monolith. “No, no. I’m fine,” Michel said, noting that\ndozens of soldiers and laborers had touched their ears in pain. He glanced\nover his shoulder at Taniel and Ka-poel, who stood side by side stoically.\nTaniel’s jaw was clenched, the veins on his face bulging, and Ka-poel\nseemed to tremble slightly.\nWith the monolith now at an angle, the workers swarmed down into the\npit, tightening ropes, while others dug feverishly at the side of the\nexcavation, causing the immense stone pylon to settle further onto its side.\nMichel could see their plan now with the mention of levers and manpower –\nthey were going to get it at the proper angle and then pull it out of the pit.\n“Major, who is in charge of the transportation?” Michel said, trying to\nsound casual.\n“I am, sir.”\n“To Dalinport?”\n“That’s the plan.”\n“Not anymore,” Michel said. “We’ve got a change of orders.”\n“Sir?” Cole said, turning his attention from the ongoing move entirely\nover to Michel. “We have everything lined up already. The road is clear, we\nhave checkpoints in place. Our engineers have even smoothed out hills in\nthe road to get this damn contraption along without a hitch.”\n“I know. I’m sorry, but things change. We found out just a few hours\nago that the Dynize have designs on this very monolith.”\n“Why?” Cole asked, clearly surprised. “It’s just an old rock.”\nTell that to everyone who’s been going mad from exposure to it. “I don’t\nknow, but we’ve got to get it as far from the coast as possible. The new\nplans are to take it across the plain to Herrenglade, where it’ll be loaded\nonto a barge and pulled upriver.” Michel glanced at Taniel. “I’ve not been\ntold where it’s going from there.”\nCole looked suspiciously from Michel to Taniel to Ka-poel. “Are you\nsure, sir?”\n“Quite.” Michel tried not to hold his breath. His whole plan hinged on\nsomeone of Cole’s rank not bothering to question the authority of a Gold\nRose. Major Cole hadn’t struck him as someone who asked questions, but\nhe’d been wrong about people before.\n“My apologies, sir,” Cole said, “but do you have those orders in\nwriting?”\nMichel removed the Gold Rose from his shirt. “I have those orders in\nme. You think the grand master would send me down here on such short\nnotice if it wasn’t so damned important?”\nCole seemed uncertain. He backed away a couple of steps, glancing\ntoward the excavation, and Michel tensed. Cole hadn’t bought it. He’d\nsummon his soldiers, and Michel, Taniel, and Ka-poel would be in a tight\nspot in moments. One he doubted he would be getting out of, even if the\nother two did."

No offense meant, sir, but I just can’t change\nit without written confirmation.”\nMichel tried not to let his panic show on his face. It had almost worked,\ndamn it. “Of course, Major Cole. But don’t say I didn’t warn you if the\ngrand master is furious over the delay.” He looked pointedly toward the\nsmoke rising over Landfall, then turned around sharply, retreating twenty\nfeet from Cole and his soldiers before whispering to Taniel and Ka-poel,\n“What do we do?”\nKa-poel lifted the satchel off her shoulder and began digging around\ninside, a frown on her face, while Taniel stared at the monolith. “That thing\nis a blight,” Taniel spat.\n“Tell me about it. I felt it when it fell,” Michel said.\n“It’s like a knot of power, just lying out here in the middle of farmland,\nwaiting for someone to come pick it up.”\n“And that someone is Lindet,” Michel said. “We need to either come up\nwith a new plan, or get the pit out of here.”\nTaniel nodded over Michel’s shoulder, and Michel turned to find Major\nCole approaching, an unhappy look on his face. “My apologies, Gold\nRose,” he said. “I’ve just got word that Dynize have landed farther south\nalong the coast, cutting off our road to Dalinport. We don’t have much time\nto get this moved, but we’ll have it heading north as quickly as we can. You\nsaid it’s bound for Herrenglade?”\n“Yes, Major,” Michel said, trying not to look relieved. He settled on\nsmug. “And it’s best we get moving quickly.”\n“Right,” Cole said, snapping a salute. “We’ll get things moving and I’ll\nhave my men arranged in a rear guard.”\n“How many soldiers do you have here?”\n“About six hundred.”\nMichel glanced at Taniel, who gave a slight shake of his head. If the\nDynize knew where the godstone was, and were headed directly here, six\nhundred men would not be enough. Michel said a silent prayer that the\ngarrison would come out to help them.\nCHAPTER 58\nS\ntyke grunted as his lance smashed through the breastplate of a Dynize\nsoldier and ripped out the back of the soldier’s uniform, dripping blood\nand gore. He leaned into the lance, trying to drag it free of the soldier’s\nbody, only for the corpse to catch on the belt of another Dynize. Styke let\ngo of the lance with a frustrated shout so that the weight of it wouldn’t\nknock him out of the saddle.\nBeside him, Ibana’s lance took a Dynize musketman through the eye,\ntearing the side of his head clean off, and then the Dynize front line was\nunder their hooves.\nThe vanguard of the Mad Lancers spread out on the road, the thunder of"

They swept forward,\nmowing down every Dynize that would not leap out of their way, while the\nRiflejack cuirassiers came on slowly behind, forming a fan that cleared the\nsides of the road of anyone who’d managed to escape the lancers’ charge.\nStyke drew up on a knoll, trying – but unable – to get a good look at the\nbeach several hundred yards to their left. A thick haze of smoke rose above\nthe sand, and the sound of muskets and carbines exchanging fire drifted\nover the dunes.\nHe had a much better view of the road heading toward Landfall, where\nseveral regiments of Dynize soldiers had fallen into line and advanced\nswiftly into withering fire from the garrison.\n“Do they even see us?” Ibana asked, reining in beside him.\n“They see us,” Styke confirmed, watching as messengers rushed\nbetween officers behind the Dynize lines. A few faces glanced back toward\nhim and his lancers. “They just don’t care.”\n“We’ve got cavalry coming up behind them, and they don’t have anyone\non horseback.” Ibana leapt from her own horse, picking up a Dynize musket\nand giving it a quick examination. “These bayonets are not long enough to\nform an effective pike line against us.”\n“They’re going to try and break the garrison before we can reach them.”\nIbana stood on her tiptoes to look toward Landfall. “The garrison has\ngotten reinforcements. They outnumber the Dynize.”\n“And I’ll give you ten-to-one that the Dynize troops are far better\ntrained than the Landfall garrison. How thick are those breastplates?”\nIbana knocked the butt of the musket she held against the breastplate of\na fallen Dynize, then turned it around and ran the bayonet through his neck.\n“Thick,” she reported. “The angle on the front gives them a good chance of\ndeflecting a musket ball at anything but close range.”\n“Shit.” Styke stood in his stirrups, looking toward the beach. “You\nnotice anything about these assholes?”\n“Other than the fact we’re outnumbered?” Ibana asked.\n“Yeah, other than that. They don’t give a shit. They’re not running.” He\nturned his horse around and rode back through the carnage to where he’d\nleft his lance in the chest of a Dynize soldier. He dismounted, ripping his\nlance free, then climbed back into the saddle and rejoined Ibana. “Give the\nsignal to re-form,” he said, sweeping his eyes across the Dynize they’d just\ncrushed. “We surprised two companies and they didn’t so much as waver.”\n“They jumped out of our way,” Ibana said, getting back in her saddle.\n“Yeah, but they didn’t break. What kind of infantry doesn’t break in\nfront of a surprise charge by twice their number in enemy cavalry?”\n“Stupid ones?” Ibana suggested.\nA nearby Riflejack cuirassier looked up from wrapping his blood-"

    "text": "front of a surprise charge by twice their number in enemy cavalry?”\n“Stupid ones?” Ibana suggested.\nA nearby Riflejack cuirassier looked up from wrapping his blood-\nsoaked arm. “Sir, infantry that doesn’t break wins the day.”\n“Not all the time,” Ibana said.\n“But enough,” Styke responded. He lifted his nose to the air, breathing\nin deep of powder smoke, getting hints of Privileged and powder mage\nsorcery like a vintner might test wine. There was something else beneath\nthe more obvious scents, but it was so subtle that his Knack was at a loss to\nidentify the source.\n“That’s the idea,” the cuirassier confirmed. “Riflejacks don’t break.\nThat’s how we win. It was the whole backbone of Field Marshal Tamas’s\ntactics.”\nStyke could still hear fighting on the beach, and realized that the\ndragoons might have bitten off more than they could chew. Something was\noff about this Dynize army, and it wasn’t just their sudden appearance. He\nfelt the urgent need to get to Lady Flint and find out what was happening at\nthe rest of the battle.\n“All right,” Styke said, “the garrison is on their own. Lancers! Carbines\nat the ready! Sweep down onto the beach and help our dragoons – once we\nclear the sand, we charge into the rear of the Dynize and keep going toward\nLandfall.”\n“What do you mean they’re not running?” Vlora demanded.\n“I mean they’re not running,” Buden slurred in Kez, next to impossible\nto understand with his half tongue.\nVlora stood up, looking out over the walls of the fort and tracking a\nPrivileged with the sights of her rifle. He was half a mile out, hands raised\nas he directed sorcery toward the point of the bay where Olem, the garrison,\nand the Riflejacks fought to hold the shore against the longboats\ncontinuously landing in the shallows. She squeezed her trigger, detonating\ntwo extra powder charges with her mind and pushing them behind the\nbullet, willing it to fly longer and farther than any normal flintlock shot.\nThe bullet soared in a perfect arc, helped by the nudge of her sorcery,\nuntil it slammed into the Privileged’s chest, knocking him into the foaming\nocean.\nShe lowered her rifle and turned her attention toward the point of the\nbay. “They don’t have anywhere to run,” she said.\n“No shit,” Buden replied, thrusting one finger forward in a frustrated\nmotion. “But a beach landing is the pit for anyone. Some of them should be\nrunning back into the water out of panic. Do you see a single soul turning\naround?”\nVlora watched as a longboat disgorged all but a handful of rowers, who\nimmediately began heading back to the distant ships. The soldiers splashed\nthrough the shallows, muskets held over their heads, ignoring the\ncontinuous fire of Olem’s soldiers with their hold on the beach. They\nreached dry sand and immediately fell to their knees, producing short, steel\nshovels from their packs and heaping up fortification in moments.\n“They’re not panicking,” Vlora said.\n“Yeah, that’s what I’m trying to tell you.”"

The Else felt… confused. There were traces of sorcery\neverywhere from the attacking Privileged, not unlike streamers left behind\nby rockets. She could also feel the protective sorcery of the fort and…\nsomething else. It was subtle, like the barest hint of a foreign spice on a\nfamiliar meal.\nShe didn’t know what it was, and that lack of knowledge terrified her.\nThere was a sudden clamor in the muster yard below, and a few\nmoments later a familiar form appeared on the top of the wall, shaking off\nthe two privates trying to tell him to keep his head down. Vlora didn’t think\nanything could have made her smile in the middle of this, but somehow the\nsight of Vallencian did.\n“Good afternoon, Lady Flint!” the Ice Baron boomed above the cannon\nfire.\n“Vallencian, I don’t think this is a good time.”\nHe pulled himself up, standing well above the protection of the fort’s\nwalls, eyes a little wild from the cannon fire but too proud to admit it.\n“Nonsense! Lady Flint, I wanted to personally tell you that I’ve forgiven\nyou for what you did to Mama Palo.”\nVlora closed her eyes, resisting the urge to order her men to drag him\nbodily down into the safety of the fort. “Thank you, Vallencian,” she said\nthrough gritted teeth. “I truly appreciate it. We are, however, fighting a\nbattle here.”\n“It doesn’t look too bad,” Vallencian said, flinching as a cannonball\nsmashed into the base of the fort a few dozen yards away and sent shattered\nbits of iron flying. A rifleman dropped his weapon, clutching his throat as\nhe tried to scream through a mouthful of blood.\n“It’s bad, Vallencian,” Vlora said firmly. “And it’s not safe. You should\nleave. Now.”\nVallencian suddenly lurched toward her, grabbing her by the shoulders.\n“I have misjudged you, Lady Flint. I was evacuating my people from the\ncity when I saw the uniforms of your men down here, manning the guns,\nand I could not leave you behind. Tell me what I can do to help with the\ndefense.”\n“Nothing,” Vlora said, waving him off desperately. She didn’t have time\nfor this. “Get out of here. Get your people to safety. I think we can hold the\nbeaches, but I don’t know how persistent the Dynize are going to be.”\n“The tide is going out,” Vallencian noted.\n“So?”\n“So, that means that the longboats will have a harder time reaching\nshore.”\n“Small gifts,” Vlora responded. Tide or no, the Dynize were still gaining\nground.\n“They have a beachhead,” Buden said, garbling the last word so badly\nshe almost didn’t understand him.\n“Vallencian, you are a good man. The best thing you can do is help\nevacuate your people and get safely out of the city. Get him out of here!”"

Get him out of here!”\nVlora ordered her soldiers, who pulled Vallencian forcefully from the wall\namid a torrent of protests. She couldn’t spare Vallencian another thought.\nBuden was right. The point of the bay was covered in corpses floating in the\nshallows, more than she could count, but the Dynize seemed impervious to\nthe deaths of their friends. They continued to leap from their longboats and\nnow had a short fortification of sand a hundred yards long from which to\nreturn fire on Olem’s troops.\n“Buden,” she said, “take one of the guns. Give Olem some support.”\nShe looked over her shoulder, eyes searching the smoldering wreckage on\nthe eastern face of the plateau. “Where are our reinforcements?” she\nmurmured. “Where are Lindet’s Blackhats? We need everything we can get\ndown here.”\nShe continued to shoot at the Dynize Privileged, forced to get more\ncreative with each shot as they formed hardened barriers of air to protect\nthemselves. She overshot one Privileged, then angled the bullet down with\nthe force of her mind, giving herself a headache in the process. Another she\nstrengthened with half a kit’s worth of powder, using brute strength to\npunch through the sorcerous shield, the Privileged, and four men behind\nhim.\nThe roar of a cannon, much louder than normal, snapped her head\naround. Buden stood beside one of the big fort guns, steadying himself\nagainst one of the gunner crew, eyes narrowed and focused on the point of\nthe bay. Vlora tracked the curve of the cannonball with her advanced\nsenses, feeling the power that Buden had put behind it, and watched as it\ncurved violently around the Dynize sand fortifications and then skipped\nalong the ground, bowling through at least fifty men crouched just out of\nthe waterline.\nThe Dynize scrambled to search for the source of the cannon fire, but\neven that didn’t seem to deter them. More men landed and charged forward\nto take the places of their dead comrades.\n“They should have run forever ago!” a nearby major shouted above the\ndin, his looking glass focused on the point of the bay. “I’ve never seen\nanything like it. Why won’t they break?”\nVlora shook her head and reloaded her rifle as a messenger reached the\ntop of the fort wall and sprinted straight toward her.\n“What news from Olem?” Vlora asked.\nThe messenger was pale, and for a moment Vlora feared the worst. But\nhe gasped for breath and then said quickly, “I’m not sure about the colonel,\nma’am. I just came from the capitol building!”\n“Good! Where’s our damned supplies and reinforcements?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“What the pit is that supposed to mean?” Vlora asked, snatching him by\nthe collar of his jacket. “Where’s the Blackhats Lindet promised me?”\n“There’s no one!”\nVlora released her grip, staggering back, and the messenger continued.\n“I’ve looked everywhere.

The capitol building is all but abandoned, and I\nhaven’t seen a single Blackhat except from a distance. It’s like they were\nnever even there.”\nVlora blinked in disbelief, feeling shell-shocked. Cannons roared\naround her, sorcery sputtering above the fort, her nostrils so thick with\npowder smoke that she thought the trance might overwhelm her. But none\nof that affected her like this news. Lindet had run. She’d sent Vlora down\nhere to fight the Dynize, and she’d fled without so much as a warning.\n“We’ve been betrayed,” she whispered.\n“What was that, ma’am?”\nShe grabbed the messenger by the shirt again, pulling him close to shout\nin his ear. “Colonel Olem is on the point of the bay. Tell him Lindet has\nbetrayed us and the Blackhats won’t be providing relief.” She looked over\nthe wall, seeing longboats rounding the breakers just a few hundred yards\naway. They’d reach the fort within minutes, or land and flank Olem.\n“What do we do?” the messenger asked, a note of panic in his voice.\nVlora pushed him back, hating herself for fighting the urge to order a\nretreat. This wasn’t her fight. These weren’t her people or her city. “We do\nwhat we’ve been paid to do. We protect the city. Tell Olem… Tell him to\nhold the point of the bay.”\nCHAPTER 59\nT\nhe Mad Lancers hit the Dynize infantry from behind with enough force\nto break even the strongest-willed soldiers, but the bastards refused to\nrun. They remained locked in combat with the garrison, faces flat in steely\ndetermination while Styke and his cavalry rode up and down the length of\nthe battle, grinding the Dynize to a pulp beneath hoof, lance, and saber until\nthe garrison – which had looked on the verge of retreat – finally found their\nspines and finished off the outnumbered Dynize.\nA cheer went up among the garrison as Styke re-formed the Riflejacks\nand lancers and rode through a gap in the Fatrastan lines. He reined in by\nthe highest-ranking officer he could find – a lieutenant – and took a grim\nassessment of the garrison.\nThey’d almost been shattered by half their number of Dynize. Men had\nfallen out of rank, broken their weapons, and some had even fled only to\nnow come crawling back sheepishly while everyone pretended they’d never\nleft. The lieutenant snapped a salute. “Timely charge, sir!”\n“You’re not getting another one,” Styke warned. “We’re heading to the\ncity. I lost hundreds of dragoons clearing that beach but more Dynize are on\ntheir way. I’ll try to get Flint to send you help.”\n“We already requested more men,” the lieutenant said.\n“Right. Form up right and quick, and pull your wounded back behind\nthe line.” Styke gestured to the edge of the suburbs, some half mile behind\nthem. “Pull back behind the marsh dikes and make it harder for them to\nreach you. The assholes don’t have very good bayonets but that armor stops\nthe better part of a good volley and they fight like sin up close.”"

The bastards wouldn’t break, no matter\nhow good we gave it to them.”\n“Nothing’s more terrifying than death,” Styke replied. “Make them pay\nfor every step, and I’ll make sure Flint sends you more men.”\nHe peeled off, joining his cavalry on their ride toward the city. Styke\nfelt his exhaustion dragging at him and could see it in the eyes of his\nlancers. After two quick, bloody engagements they were sagging, already\nused up from a full day’s ride. They needed rest, and lots of it.\nThey weren’t going to get it.\n“Your lance is broken,” Ibana said, slowing down to ride beside him.\nStyke blinked at the shattered, bloody lance that ended just a few feet\nfrom his hand. He discarded it and leaned over Amrec, checking the horse’s\nneck and chest for any damage. There were half a dozen nicks and cuts, but\nnothing major enough to cause concern. He gestured to Amrec’s underbelly.\n“Legs?” he asked.\nIbana shook her head. “Good as gold.”\nHe ran his eyes over her mount. “Deep cut on the left flank. Will need\nstitches. Where’s Jackal?”\n“Appropriating a horse from one of our fallen,” she said. “His broke a\nleg and had to be put down.”\nStyke cringed. The death of men rarely bothered him, but the loss of a\ngood horse always struck him as a tragedy. He turned Amrec around,\nstanding in the stirrups, hoping the garrison looked in better shape from\nbehind. They didn’t.\n“Another attack like that one and they’ll break,” Ibana observed,\nshaking gore from the tip of her lance and raising it above her head.\nStyke couldn’t help but agree. The garrison was slowly pulling itself\ntogether and drawing back in the lancers’ wake toward the marsh trenches\nas he’d suggested. Styke dragged a sleeve over his nose, trying to get the\nsmell of powder and death out of his nostrils so he could breathe properly.\nThat strange hint of sorcery was still there, touching his senses, but not\nquite comprehensible. “I smell something,” he said.\nIbana frowned. “Sorcery?”\n“I don’t know. It’s there, just nothing I can identify. It feels like it’s in\nus, around us.”\n“Bone-eye?” Ibana asked.\nThe thought hadn’t occurred to Styke. “The Dynize are known for the\nbastards, aren’t they?”\n“And we have no idea what they’re capable of.”\nStyke thought back to his encounter, real or imagined, with Ka-poel\nyesterday afternoon, and the blood that had disappeared from his face. He\ndidn’t realize it at the time, but he now felt distinctly marked. He tried not\nto think about it and drew his heavy saber, checking the blade with his\nthumb.\n“Don’t insult me like that,” Ibana snapped. “I sharpened it myself.”\n“Just checking!” Styke assured her. “One of yours?”\n“Dad’s actually.

He still makes a common blade from time to time, just\nto keep his edge.”\n“Is he… ?” Styke asked, letting the rest of the sentence waver off in\nuncertainty.\nIbana didn’t meet his eyes. “When we left yesterday he was recovering.\nThe Privileged healing almost killed him.” She frowned into the distance.\n“Is that smoke over Greenfire Depths?”\nStyke’s whole attention had been on the coast until this point. He looked\ntoward the plateau and was surprised to see thick black columns rising\nabove the western half of the city. He felt his stomach clench. If Greenfire\nDepths went up in flame, they might lose the entire Palo quarter. Not that\nmany Kressians would care, but that’s where Old Man Fles was now. “I’m\nsure his apprentices will get him out,” he said softly.\n“I know they will,” Ibana retorted. She checked the pan of her carbine\nand then began to reload. “The last thing anyone needs is a riot in Greenfire\nDepths while we’re under attack.”\n“If the fighting just started a couple of hours ago, does anyone in the\nDepths even know?” Styke wondered aloud. He couldn’t help but wonder\nhow Lindet was dealing with all of this – she thrived under multiple\npressures, and she had a lot of Blackhats in the city. She would probably\ndraw them in close and use them only as a last resort. If the Dynize reached\nthe suburbs the brutality of the fighting would make these engagements\nlook like light skirmishes.\nStyke pulled himself out of his thoughts and joined the vanguard, where\nhe found Jackal now riding a blue roan beside a bloody-faced Major Gustar.\nThe lance holding the Mad Lancers’ standard had been broken, then\nmended with a belt, and now flew just a little lower and more crooked.\nSomehow it seemed fitting.\n“Orders, Colonel?” Gustar asked, trying to salute but only managing to\nbring his hand halfway to his face.\nStyke admired the man’s dedication but didn’t show an ounce of pity.\nThese Riflejacks were no Mad Lancers, but they definitely had guts. “Hug\nthe coast. We’ve got flatland between here and the port, and the garrison’s\ngoing to have their hands full with Dynize troops. We’ll sweep the beach\nand report to Lady Flint for orders.”\n“Taking orders now, are we?” Ibana asked in a low, only slightly\nsarcastic voice. “Either you’re getting old, or you actually think Flint has\njudgment worth a damn.”\n“Both,” Styke replied. “But we’ll find out for sure if we’re still alive at\nthe end of this.” He cast his eyes around once again at the tired faces, the\nworn-out horses, and stood up in his stirrups, raising his saber into the air.\n“Ride for blood!” he ordered.\nA fireball struck the ground with the force of a mortar shot just a dozen feet\nin front of Styke.

Amrec went up on his hind legs, screaming in terror, and\nStyke – a sword in one hand and carbine in the other, his numb legs a poor\npurchase on Amrec’s sides – was thrown from his saddle. He hit the ground,\nears ringing, breath knocked out like he’d been hit by a boulder.\nHorses thundered by on the rocky sand of the point of the bay, and his\nsurroundings were almost entirely obscured by the thick pall of powder\nsmoke, lit from time to time by sorcery and exploding mortars. The shore\nwas pounded by enemy guns as if the Dynize cared little whether they\nstruck their own men.\nTo Styke’s right, crimson-coated Riflejacks and yellow-clad garrison\nsoldiers fought like mad dogs against the never-ending, if inconsistent, tide\nof Dynize soldiers coming in from his left. Corpses of all three groups lay\nscattered on the beach.\nStyke gained his feet, discarding the carbine that had snapped in half\nbeneath him on his fall, and grabbed the hot muzzle of a charging Dynize\nsoldier, redirecting the short bayonet over his shoulder and felling the\nsoldier with a single blow to the neck from his saber.\n“Amrec! Amrec, damn it!” Styke searched the bodies of nearby horses\nfor Amrec, but none of them was nearly big enough. He heard a horse\nscream somewhere in the smoke but could not pinpoint the source. He\nthrew himself toward the closest skirmish between Dynize and Fatrastan\nforces.\nThe Dynize breastplates, like a cuirassier’s, were only armored on the\nfront, held on by leather straps over the shoulders and around the back.\nStyke severed a Dynize spine from behind, laying about with the blade of\nhis saber. A nearby Riflejack fell beneath a Dynize bayonet, and Styke\ngrabbed the Dynize soldier by the back of the neck, squeezing until the\nwoman went limp, then throwing her body onto the poor bastard she’d just\nskewered.\nAnother blast – a mortar – exploded nearby, and Styke felt the hot sting\nof shrapnel tear through his jacket, scoring his side and legs. He staggered\nfrom the force of the blast, nearly losing his head to a cannonball that\nglanced off the sand twenty yards away and bounced over his shoulder,\nblowing a hole clean through the breastplate of a Dynize musketman.\nHe continued fighting his way along the point of the bay, navigating by\nkeeping the source of the sorcery to his left and the higher, rockier ground\non his right. Occasionally a riderless horse ran through the smoke, bucking\nand crying, but none of them was Amrec.\nThe fighting grew more fierce, the more organized Riflejacks keeping\nthe Dynize at bay at the end of their long bayonets. Styke found a\nuniformed body, crushed by the eviscerated corpse of a horse, and\nrecognized the rider as one of his Mad Lancers, though the name escaped\nhim after so many years.\nA Dynize suddenly tore through the smoke, leaping bodies with the\nagility of a gazelle, a pair of bone axes in hand and torso protected by the\nnow-familiar dark green leather of a swamp dragon.

Styke coughed, spat up\nblood, and gave chase as the dragonman tore into a pair of Riflejacks,\nleaving them dead in his wake faster than either of them could raise a\nbayonet.\nStyke caught up to the dragonman with long, painful strides, slashing\nwith his saber. He missed, then leapt fully into the dragonman’s side as the\nwarrior reached a squad of Riflejacks, sending them both tumbling through\nthe group of soldiers.\nThe dragonman came out of the tumble on top, spitting sand and blood,\nand slammed the haft of an ax into Styke’s nose. Styke, his saber lost,\npunched the dragonman in the jaw, causing the Dynize to lurch back, dazed,\nbefore he caught Styke’s second punch and twisted his arm painfully to one\nside. Styke fought back, flexing, using every ounce of his strength, until the\ndragonman’s head suddenly snapped back and the sound of a pistol being\nfired at point-blank range left Styke’s ears ringing.\nStyke shoved the body off him and got to his feet, only to find Olem –\none arm bloody and bandaged, a deep slice along his left cheek, and his hat\ngone – standing with the smoking pistol among a squad of Riflejacks.\n“I would have won it,” Styke spat, half-joking, half-serious. Blood\npounded in his ears, and he felt every tendon tight and ready for movement,\nhis body like an oiled spring.\n“I believe you,” Olem said. “But we don’t have time for their shit. One\nof those assholes already wounded Davd.”\nStyke didn’t bother asking who Davd was. “I lost my horse,” he said.\n“See a big bastard come through here?”\n“I saw your second in command a few moments ago,” Olem said. He\nsuddenly lurched sideways, caught by a sergeant on his left. He shook his\nhead, as if he wasn’t sure where he was, then pointed. “Well timed on the\ncavalry, but you’re useless in this smoke. If you can rally your men take\nthem west. Flint will have use for you.”\n“You’ll be able to hold the shore?” Styke asked.\nOlem managed a smile, causing the deep gash on his cheek to weep\nblood. “We need infantry, not dragoons. I’m pulling my boys back before\nthis gets any worse. Go on, get out of here.”\nStyke found Ibana less than fifty feet away. She was still on her own\nhorse and held Amrec’s reins in her teeth, forcing both horses to twirl,\nhooves flashing, battering at the Dynize infantry that stabbed at her with\ntheir short bayonets.

Gustar’s horse had a\ndefinite limp, and his hand was bloody and hastily wrapped.\n“This isn’t going well,” Ibana reported.\n“We’re to pull back,” Styke said. “Get everyone out of this blasted\nsmoke. Olem is letting the Dynize have the point of the bay.”\nGustar just nodded wearily, riding into the smoke. A moment later an\nAdran bugle sounded.\n“Try not to forget you’re not wearing your armor anymore,” Ibana said,\nappraising the cuts on Styke’s side and arm.\n“What’s that supposed to mean?” Styke asked.\n“It means you need to not ride into bloody sorcery and artillery fire,\nthat’s what it means. Sorcery and grapeshot are going to kill you as easily as\nany other man.”\nStyke looked at the blood soaking through his clothes. The pain was\nsharp, acute. It lit his senses like a fire. “I’ll try not to do anything stupid.”\n“Letting the Dynize have any ground at all seems foolish.”\n“No choice,” Styke replied. “They’ve paid for it in blood.” He urged\nAmrec into a gallop, racing west, and within a minute the smoke had all but\ncleared. He watched over his shoulder as Riflejacks, the Fatrastan garrison,\nand his own cavalry emerged from the haze, clear relief in their eyes at\nbeing given the order to withdraw. The Dynize didn’t seem to follow them\nout of the smoke, and he wondered if they’d finally used up all their men –\nor if they were just happy to take the beachhead and prepare for their next\nattack.\nHe ignored them all and set his sights on the causeway leading to Fort\nNied.\nCHAPTER 60\nM\nessengers streamed in and out of Fort Nied, leaving Vlora with an\nincreasingly uneasy feeling in the pit of her stomach. The garrison was\nunder heavy fire from troops that had landed north of the city, while Olem\nfaced heavy losses at the point of the bay, and the smoke from musket fire\nover his position continued to rise as fast as the breeze blew it away,\nmaking it next to impossible for Vlora, Norrine, or Buden to give Olem any\nsupport fire.\nGreenfire Depths was in flames, and the Blackhats had been seen\nfleeing the city en masse. She ordered the garrison to bring any and all\ncannons from the old forts scattered around the city to the eastern edge of\nthe plateau, and diverted two thousand men from the southern side of the\ncity to reinforce the north, and another nine hundred to help Olem.\n“All of them!” she shouted at a messenger in a yellow Fatrastan jacket.\n“We’re not going to hold the bay, and I intend on making it next to\nimpossible for the Dynize to take the plateau. Get me every weapon not\nnailed down inside the city. Raid Blackhat depots, I don’t give a damn!”\n“But the Blackhats…”\n“Are gone! Damn it, I’ll have my own men do it.

Bloody pit, get out of\nmy way!” She ran to the other end of the wall, taking a spare rifle from a\nwounded private she’d assigned to load her weapons. She searched the Else\nfor a Dynize Privileged and, when she couldn’t find one, put a bullet\nthrough the eye of what looked like a Dynize officer.\nShe paused, lowering her rifle, and returned to the Fatrastan messenger.\n“Wait!” she shouted. “I want this rioting put down, and the fires in\nGreenfire Depths extinguished. Anyone in the garrison who isn’t dedicated\nto direct combat needs to do that. Get me newspapers, city criers,\neverything. If the rioters know the city is under attack by a foreign force,\nthey might abate.”\nA cannonball slammed into the top of the wall, and Vlora ducked, and\nthe sound that accompanied the impact put her on edge. A single glance\nconfirmed her fear: Masonry had shattered. The Dynize attack had finally\nbroken the sorcery holding Fort Nied together.\n“I need engineers up here!” she shouted, glancing over the edge of the\nwall. Longboats drew near, too numerous for her smaller gun crews to pick\nout of the water with grapeshot. Men stood in the prows with grappling\nhooks, ready to scale the walls of the fort. “Does nothing scare these\nassholes?”\nShe took one step and sagged, her right leg refusing to obey her. She\nlooked down to find a shard of limestone as big as her thumb and twice as\nlong sticking out of her leg, blood soaking the pants around it. She jerked it\nout, so deep in a powder trance that she barely registered the pain, and\nquickly bound the wound with her handkerchief.\nThe pain she could drown out, but her muscles wouldn’t respond.\nShe limped along the wall. “We can win,” she whispered to herself. “We\ncan win. We will not break in the face of our enemies. We will hold strong.\nWe are the anvil. We are the stone.” She reached the closest of her\nremaining gun crews and staggered over to the commander as he shouted\norders.\n“Distance, five hundred yards!”\n“Distance, five hundred yards!” one of the crew repeated, helping the\nothers adjust the aim of the gun. “Sir, ready to fire!”\n“Fire!”\nThe cannon kicked back several feet, belching flame and noise. In the\ndistance, the mast of a Dynize capital ship suddenly cracked, split, and with\nthe slow momentum of a falling tree, toppled to the deck, scattering sailors\nand gunners.\n“Report,” Vlora demanded of the gun commander.\n“Range, four-hundred and ninety yards. Reload, reload!” The gunner\ndidn’t bother looking or saluting. “We’re almost out of straight shot,\nGeneral,” he shouted over the din. “We’ve got a few hundred rounds of\ncanister left, but the boats will be here any moment.”\n“Major,” Vlora shouted at an officer in the muster yard below, “I want\nriflemen lining the walls!

    "text": "riflemen lining the walls! Give everyone double ammunition and tell them\nto fix bayonets.”\nThe gun commander continued: “The ships are getting closer. We’ve\nsunk at least eighteen of the warships and another thirty or so of the\ntransports and small support, but there’s just too damn many of them. We\nhave” – he paused, scanning the walls, his lips moving as he counted – “just\neight big guns left. Their ships of the line are getting close enough for some\nserious accuracy.”\nVlora slapped the gun commander on the shoulder. “Keep giving them\nthe pit,” she ordered, limping over to another set of messengers. She was\nsurprised to find one of them was a Palo, wearing one of the pale green\nuniforms she’d last seen on Mama Palo’s men. Her heart leapt into her\nthroat before she remembered that Mama Palo – the real Mama Palo – was\non her side.\n“You first,” she said, pointing to the Palo.\n“Message from the Red Hand,” the Palo said, looking entirely\nunimpressed by the chaos of the battle raging around them. “He says that\nthe Dynize infiltrators have started the fires and the riots in Greenfire\nDepths. He’s dealing with that now.”\nVlora let out a sigh. Finally, some good news. She’d forgotten entirely\nabout Taniel and Ka-poel’s Palo followers. If they could take care of the\nDynize in Greenfire Depths and watch Vlora’s back, it would let her\ncommit the last of her garrison reserves to the fight – soldiers she\ndesperately needed. “Does he have any men he could spare for this?” she\nasked, gesturing toward the ocean.\nThe Palo messenger shook his head. “The Dynize have landed more\nmen south of the city.”\nVlora let herself sag against the inner wall, letting out a soft sigh. We\nare the anvil. We are the rocks upon which our enemy will shatter. “I’ve just\nredirected all my men south of the city to reinforce the bay and the north.”\n“The Red Hand demands reinforcements to the south.”\n“He doesn’t demand shit,” Vlora snapped, suppressing the urge to take a\nswing at the Palo. “Don’t shoot the messenger,” she decided, was coined for\nthis exact situation.\n“The Red Hand wants you to know that the item in question is two\nmiles south of the city. It needs to be protected from falling into Dynize\nhands.”\n“The item in…” It took Vlora a moment before she understood what\nthat meant. “The godstone.”\n“That is what he called it, yes.”\nVlora called down to the muster yard. “Major, do we have anyone else\nat all we can send south?”\nThe major opened his mouth to respond but was cut off by the sudden\nthunder of hooves as Styke, Ibana, and a half-dozen Mad Lancers – along\nwith Major Gustar – rode through the open gates of the fort. Vlora’s mind\nimmediately changed directions and she waved off the major in the muster\nyard. “Styke!” she bellowed. “Report, now!”\nStyke reined in just below her. “We’ve swept the beaches up north on\nour way in, and relieved Olem enough for him to withdraw from the point"

    "text": "Styke reined in just below her. “We’ve swept the beaches up north on\nour way in, and relieved Olem enough for him to withdraw from the point\nof the bay.” Vlora swore. She needed him to hold that point. But Olem\nwouldn’t pull back without damn good reason. “I’ve had about five hundred\ncasualties,” Styke went on. “Leaves me with a little over eight hundred\nable-bodied riders.”\nVlora swore again. She’d hoped he’d arrive with full strength, but if\nhe’d already been in two engagements, she should be impressed that he had\nanyone left at all. She looked toward the point of the bay, wondering how\nsuicidal Styke really was to have ordered a charge into that smoky chaos on\nuneven ground.\n“Two miles south of the city,” she said. “There’s an artifact down there.\nI don’t know where, I don’t know what the pit it looks like, but I need you\nto find it and secure it.”\nStyke and Ibana both frowned, exchanging a glance. “But the battle…”\n“You’ll get your battle,” Vlora said. “The Dynize are coming up from\nthe south, and they want that artifact. I don’t know if they’re heading for it\nspecifically, but if they find it before you get there we’ll have a pit of a time\ntaking it back.”\nStyke nodded. “Right-o, General.” Without another word he turned his\nbig gelding back around and rode at the head of his men out of the muster\nyard. Vlora watched him go with a desperate longing. She needed Styke\nhere, performing sweeps of the beach to relieve her defenders. But there\nwas no one else to send, and the Dynize could not have the godstone.\n“Ma’am,” the gunner commander shouted, “we need those riflemen up\nhere now!”\n“Major, get me those riflemen!”\n“They’ll be sitting ducks on that wall! The ships are too close.”\nVlora grit her teeth, turning to look toward the ships of the line that\nwere now just outside of the bay, broadside toward the fort, opening fire\nwith fearless determination. “I’ll take care of it,” she said. “Just get your\nmen up here.”\nStaggering forward, Vlora put both hands on the wall and then cast her\nsenses outward until she found the powder magazine in the depths of the\nwarship’s hold. Hundreds of barrels of powder, all crowded together in one\nplace. It took only a single thought to ignite it all, but she knew she’d feel a\nkickback strong enough to drop an elephant.\nShe touched off the powder and immediately felt like a wagon had run\nover her. She groaned, her head spinning, watching the ship blow apart\nthrough blurry vision, trying to breathe through a suddenly tight chest. It\ntook her several moments to recover enough to have the presence of mind\nto duck as infantry in the Dynize longboats opened fire on the walls.\nWithin moments she was surrounded by her own riflemen, and the\ncomforting cracks of Hrusch rifles returning fire.\nCHAPTER 61\nM\nichel watched, amazed, as the crews under Professor Cressel’s\ndirection managed to extricate the monolith from its sunken pit in the\nground in less than two hours.

Using a combination of ramps, cranes, and\nbrute force, the stone column was pulled up and out onto a prepared soil\nshelf. The cranes were cleared away and the land-barge backed up beside\nthe stage while laborers with shovels and pickaxes adjusted the contours of\nthe land so that there was a gap of mere inches between the monolith and\nthe land-barge.\nIt was a fascinating bit of engineering and, to Michel’s eyes, went\nincredibly smoothly. A laborer’s leg was caught in the spoke of the land-\nbarge and had to be removed, but the man was carried off within minutes\nand the work continued, undistracted.\nWhile Cressel prepared to move the monolith onto the land-barge,\nMichel caught sight of Ka-poel up on top of the horizontal monolith. She\nsquatted, fingers tracing shapes on the monolith’s exterior like a child\nplaying in the sand.\n“What’s she doing up there? You up there, get down!” Professor Cressel\nwaved his arms at her, but she ignored him. “Major Cole!” he shouted.\nMajor Cole lifted his head from a discussion with his troop, pointing\nCressel toward Michel, who glanced at Taniel as the professor stormed\ntoward them. “What is she doing?” Michel asked.\n“Don’t ask me,” Taniel said. “We’ve been together almost eleven years,\nand I still don’t understand her half the time.”\n“She knows that people have gone mad from being too close to that\nthing, right?”\n“She knows,” Taniel confirmed.\nProfessor Cressel approached, pointing over his shoulder. “Gold Rose,\nwould you be so kind as to remove your companion from the specimen?”\n“Why?” Michel asked. “Is she bothering anything?”\n“It’s quite unsafe! I’ve dismissed all the researchers from the site aside\nfrom myself. The move is very dangerous. The fact we haven’t lost anyone\nyet today is a miracle!”\nMichel leaned over to Taniel. “Does she need to be up there?”\n“Pole!” Taniel said, cupping his hand around his mouth. “Pole!”\nShe waved her hand dismissively, and Taniel gave Michel an\nunapologetic shrug. “She’s working. Nothing but force is going to get her\ndown. You’re welcome to try, but I’m not going to.”\n“Does she know that the entire monolith could shift or slide?” Professor\nCressel demanded, tugging at the last wisps of gray hair on his head. “It\ncould take an arm, or a leg, or crush her completely!”\n“She’s aware of the danger,” Michel assured him. “Your men can work\naround her.”\nCressel retreated to his dig, fuming silently, and Michel chewed on the\ninside of his cheek. Every so often he glanced toward Landfall. The smoke\nfrom Greenfire Depths had gotten worse, and he hoped that his mother had\nmanaged to escape the city by now.

The sound of bombardment was\nnear constant, and he could see the pinprick lights of shells bursting high\nover the ocean. It seemed so distant and unimportant, but it wouldn’t be for\nlong.\n“Major Cole,” Taniel said loudly, “any word from your men on the\napproaching Dynize?”\nCole finished speaking to his officers and then crossed to them, a grim\nlook on his face. “There’s four regiments just finished landing about six\nmiles from here. At best we have a few hours until they get here. I’ve sent\nrunners back to Landfall with requests for reinforcements. No idea if we’re\ngoing to get them or not. One of my boys from the city just arrived, and he\nsaid the fighting there is bad.”\nMichel exchanged an alarmed glance with Taniel. None of that was\ngood news. If the Dynize reached them, they wouldn’t stand a chance. But\nthe news that Cole was actively sending messages to Landfall meant that\nMichel’s trickery might be discovered.\n“Can this be hurried along?” Michel asked.\n“Cressel assures me he’s hurrying the best he can without risking\ndamage to the obelisk.”\n“Good, good,” Michel said. He started to pace, counting out ten paces,\nthen walking back to Taniel before repeating the route several times. Major\nCole watched him do it once, then returned to his officers, barking out\norders. Michel stopped his pacing to watch the chain of command as\nofficers passed orders to enlisted men, and the soldiers began to slowly shift\nto the southeast of the dig site, forming themselves into a protective cordon\naround the excavation.\nA loud creaking brought Michel’s attention back to the monolith, and he\nturned just in time to see Ka-poel ride the immense stone off the dirt shelf\nupon which it rested to slide down thick, flattened timbers and crunch onto\nthe land-barge. The monolith came to a stop, the land-barge and its load\nsettling almost a foot closer to the ground. Michel let out a breath he didn’t\nrealize he’d been holding in, and Taniel shook his head.\nKa-poel flashed them both a grin, then returned to studying the side of\nthe monolith.\nMichel approached Professor Cressel, clapping his hands. “Well done,\nCressel, well done. Are we ready to move?” He could hear the desperation\nin his tone and tried to suppress it.\nThe professor adjusted his glasses, squinting at an open folder in his\nhands. “The engineers are checking the axles and securing the load. We\nshould be ready to move out in half an hour.”\nMichel grimaced. “Make it fifteen minutes.”\n“Sir!” Cressel protested.\nMichel waved his finger under Cressel’s nose with a confidence he\ndidn’t feel. “Fifteen minutes, unless you want your eyeballs to wind up as\nDynize trophies.”\n“Dynize don’t take eyeballs as trophies.” Cressel snorted.\n“Whatever.

Make it quick, Professor, time is running out.”\nA tap on his shoulder brought Michel around to find Taniel standing\nbeside him. Taniel’s attention was no longer on the monolith or the soldiers,\nand he took an indiscreet snort of powder and pointed north. “You see\nthat?”\nMichel squinted. “I don’t see anything.”\n“Riders coming in. Cole should spot them in a few minutes.”\n“Is it relief from Landfall?”\n“Maybe,” Taniel said. “Maybe not.” He peered into the distance like a\nbig cat warily protecting its kill, then said, “They’re Blackhats.”\n“Shit. We’ve got to go,” Michel said, already heading toward the corral\nwhere Cole had stashed their horses. He turned to find Taniel not following\nhim, then ran back and snatched him by a sleeve. “It’s not worth the risk,”\nhe said. “If the Blackhats know that I attacked Fidelis Jes they’ll snatch me\nthe moment they see me, and you and Ka-poel a few seconds after. We’ve\ngot to get out of here while we still can.”\nTaniel suddenly smiled, shaking his head. “We wait.”\nMichel resumed his pacing, doing two quick rounds before returning to\nTaniel’s side. “You’re sure you want to do this?”\n“Go if you want,” Taniel said. “But Ka-poel and I will stay.”\nMichel swore to himself. Every instinct told him to run. The Blackhats\nwould skin him alive over the course of a very, very long time if he was\nfound here by anyone aware of who he really was. Fidelis Jes might be\nalive or dead, but it didn’t matter – he would have told someone about\nMichel’s betrayal, if only his secretary, and they’d be out for Michel’s\nblood. “Is this it?” he asked.\nTaniel looked at him in surprise. “Is what it?”\n“This godstone? Is this the culmination of all my work? Is this what I\ntoiled for years to discover? Was this my true purpose in joining the\nBlackhats?”\nTaniel seemed to consider the question for several moments before\nanswering slowly. “This was one of many perceived purposes. It would\nhave been preferable to leave you among them, but yes… the discovery of\nthe godstone was the most important thing we had in mind when we sent\nyou to work for the Blackhats.”\nThe revelation gave Michel a sense of peace that he hadn’t expected. It\nfelt as if a great weight had been lifted from his shoulders and he mentally\nexamined the marble that he’d kept his real self in for so many years before\ndiscarding it with an almost giddy laugh.\n“What’s so funny?” Taniel asked.\n“Nothing,” Michel said. “I’ll stay.”\nAs Taniel predicted, Major Cole’s scouts saw the Blackhats just a few\nminutes later, and Michel himself noted the dust cloud a little after that.\nLike Michel, Taniel, and Ka-poel, the Blackhats didn’t bother with the road,\nriding instead straight across the farmland directly toward the dig site.

By\nthe look of things, there were a damned lot of them, and as they drew closer\nMichel could see that they were heavily armed.\nHis decision to see this whole business with the godstone through to the\nend seemed less and less like a good one.\nAnd then it got worse.\n“Major Cole!” one of the guards shouted across the din of laborers\npreparing the land-barge for moving. “We’ve got a thousand Blackhats\ncoming in, with Fidelis Jes himself! They say he wants a report from you\npersonally!”\nMichel’s mouth tasted of ash. He looked at Taniel.\n“You’re right,” Taniel said with a low whistle. “Time to go. Get Ka-\npoel, I’ll fetch the horses.”\nWaiting until Major Cole’s attention was elsewhere, Michel made his\nway over to the side of the land-barge. “Ka-poel!” he hissed, repeating her\nname three times before she finally looked up from her studies with a\nfrown. She tried to wave him away. “No,” he replied. “Fidelis Jes will be\nhere any moment. We have to go now.”\nKa-poel gestured rudely at him before smacking her fist against the\nmonolith in frustration, then heading toward the other side. Michel threw\nhimself under the land-barge, crawling on all fours beneath the creaking,\nweighty axles, sweat pouring down his face by the time he made it to the\nother side. Ka-poel was already down, and she helped him to his feet and\nthe two ran for Taniel.\nThey met him at the corral as he brought out their horses. They were\nmounted a few moments later, and riding out of the camp when a guard\nwaved them down. “Sir! Major Cole wants to know where you’re going!”\n“We’re heading out to meet the grand master,” Michel threw over his\nshoulder, not bothering to look back.\n“But you’re going in the wrong direction!”\n“No,” Michel muttered to himself. “We’re definitely going in the right\ndirection.” They broke out of the camp and had gone about a hundred yards\nwhen he said, “Wait. No, we’re going in the wrong direction. Taniel, where\nthe pit are we going?”\n“East,” Taniel responded over his shoulder.\n“I can see that! But east is the ocean. East is the Dynize!”\n“We hug the coast and head north back to Landfall. Vlora will need the\nhelp, and if we can get any of her men we’ll be able to come back and take\nthe godstone from Fidelis Jes.”\nMichel wanted to shout how stupid an idea that was, and how much he\nwanted to head away from the burning city, but his words turned into a\nstrangled shout as he spotted a number of Blackhats peel off the main\ncontingent and head to cut them off. “Taniel!”\n“I see them.”\nKa-poel rode close and snatched Michel’s reins and then bent over her\nown horse, urging her onward. The three practically flew across the plains,\nTaniel and Ka-poel riding like the wind while Michel just clung to his\nsaddle horn, hoping he didn’t fly off and break his neck when they leapt a\nditch.

The Blackhats drew closer and closer, and Michel’s certainty they\nwould be caught grew deeper until Taniel suddenly veered northwest.\n“Why are we heading toward them?” Michel asked.\n“I have a plan,” Taniel said. Michel spared a look up from the back of\nhis horse’s neck to see that Taniel’s eyes were on Landfall, not the\napproaching Blackhats.\n“Focus!” Michel shouted. He squeezed his eyes closed and heaved,\nwondering if he had anything left in his stomach to throw up. Their gallop\nsuddenly slowed, and he opened his eyes again to find the Blackhats upon\nthem, Taniel’s hands held in the air. Michel felt a sudden sinking feeling,\ndizziness threatening to pitch him from the saddle. “We’re surrendering?”\nhe managed.\n“We’re surrendering,” Taniel confirmed. “For now.”\nMichel’s bowels felt like water, and he tried to seek a way out of this to\nno avail. There were about thirty Blackhats to the three of them. Michel was\nuseless in a fight, and he knew that most of Ka-poel’s sorcery depended on\npreparation. That would leave thirty men to Taniel, which, he considered\noptimistically, might not be that difficult if they were all carrying powder.\nHe decided that must be Taniel’s plan, and gritted his teeth, waiting for\nTaniel to detonate their powder, killing the lot of them. The moment never\ncame.\n“Agent Bravis,” a voice called out.\nMichel didn’t think he could feel any sicker. The voice disproved him.\n“Grand master,” he answered, staring at his saddle horn like a sullen child.\nFidelis Jes rode to the front of his column of Blackhats, head held high,\nface flushed from a hard ride. “Gutsy,” he said, a small note of admiration\nin his voice. “We intercepted a message from Major Cole that you were in\nthe camp about twenty minutes ago. Imagine my delight when you tried to\nrun.”\n“Delight imagined, sir,” Michel said. He wondered if he should just get\nthis over with now – he could charge the grand master, weaponless, and\nhope that Fidelis Jes’s bodyguards gunned him down in the process. It was\nthe best idea he could come up with on the spur of the moment, and it didn’t\nsound all that appealing.\nBetter than dying slowly in a torture chamber, though.\nJes rubbed the back of his neck, which was covered by his collar, and\nMichel allowed himself the fantasy of a dark purple bruise back there. How\nthe bastard had managed to survive being punched in the spine by\nknuckledusters was beyond him, but when it came to Fidelis Jes his survival\nseemed almost a given. Jes cast a curious glance at Taniel and Ka-poel, his\ngaze lingering on the latter. “You have a lot of explaining to do, Agent\nBravis. You’ll be coming with us to Dalinport, where you’ll have plenty of\ntime to do so.”\n“The road to Dalinport is blocked,” Taniel said. “The Dynize have\nlanded.”\n“I’ve brought enough men to put down the Dynize in our path,” Jes\nsaid."

That will certainly help.”\n“Who the pit is this?” Fidelis Jes demanded.\nMichel gave him a wan smile, but did not answer.\n“Who are you?” Jes spat at Taniel.\nTaniel sighed, as if annoyed that it had come to this, and then tugged on\nthe fingers to his left glove. He pulled it off, revealing the blood-red skin of\nhis hand.\nJes’s perpetual sneer deepened. “The Red Hand? Bah. I expected better\nof you, Agent Bravis. A cabal spy; a Kez nationalist; I expected you to be\nbetter than working for a common rebel.”\n“Not terribly common,” Michel said, watching as Taniel slowly got off\nhis horse and drew his sword from his saddlebags.\n“Fidelis Jes,” Taniel said, “I’ve wanted to kill you for a very long time.”\n“Sir,” one of Jes’s officers warned, “we don’t have time for this.”\nFidelis Jes seemed to vacillate between getting to the dig site and a good\nfight. Michel was less than surprised when his baser instincts won out and\nhe slid gracefully from his saddle and grabbed his sword, walking toward\nTaniel. “Who are you?” he asked. “I expected the Red Hand to be Palo, but\nyou’re obviously Adran.”\n“Michel’s tale of an Adran expatriate was closer than you’d think,”\nTaniel said, running two fingers down the length of his sword as if to test\nthe blade. Michel thought he heard the sound of distant hoofbeats, but his\neyes were glued to the scene in front of him. He silently urged Taniel to just\nkill the bastard and stop screwing around.\nFidelis Jes stretched lightly, bending one way, then the next, his eyes\nnever leaving Taniel. “I expect this to be quick,” he said. “So if you have\nanything else to tell me, do it now.”\nTaniel closed his eyes halfway, holding his sword out in front of him in\nboth hands, tip pointed toward the ground as if he were praying. He\nremained that way for almost thirty seconds before Fidelis Jes lost his\npatience.\n“Your time is up,” the grand master snapped, stepping forward.\nTaniel’s sword came up, tip pointing over Jes’s shoulder, and he barked\nthe words, “I’m not here to kill you.”\nJes sneered. “You’re right about that.”\n“He is.”\nTaniel leapt out of the way of Jes’s thrust, moving so quickly Michel\ncould barely follow him. Taniel grabbed Jes by the back of the hair, kicking\none leg to make him stumble, and turned him around, shoving him forward.\nMichel lifted his eyes, surprised to see more riders coming in just behind\nthe Blackhats.\nThe man at their head was the biggest, ugliest man Michel had ever\nseen.

    "text": "the Blackhats.\nThe man at their head was the biggest, ugliest man Michel had ever\nseen. He wore a faded Fatrastan cavalry jacket and rode a black warhorse\nwith a black and brown mottled neck. His face was pitted and scarred, his\nback slightly bent in the saddle, and he rode ahead of a standard flying an\nimage of a lance through a skull. The same skull that was on the ring that\nFidelis Jes wore.\nMichel didn’t have to ask who that was.\n“Jes!” Ben Styke roared, throwing himself from the saddle before his\nhorse had even come to a complete stop. “You’re a dead man!”\nCHAPTER 62\nS\ntyke strode toward Fidelis Jes, chest heaving from the ride, every bit of\ntiredness that had threatened to make him call a halt on the journey south\nof the city now gone from his mind. He gripped his saber in one hand, his\nother balled in a fist, and he ignored the startled shouts of the Blackhats\naround him. Behind Jes stood Taniel, sword drawn, and behind him Ka-poel\nand another Blackhat were still on horseback.\nJes looked between Taniel and Styke as if unsure from which direction\nthe fight was coming, but Taniel stepped back and gave a slight bow. Jes\nturned his attention entirely to Styke.\n“I’ve already killed you twice,” Jes said. “I’m going to make sure the\nthird time is more permanent.”\nEven Styke had to admit Jes cut a fine figure. He wore the Blackhat\nuniform, black on black with the buttons up the side of his jacket, tailored\nto hug his muscled chest and legs. He wore a thin white scarf around his\nneck and a Platinum Rose pinned to his left breast, with Styke’s lancer’s\nring on his thumb and boz knife at his belt. Styke spared a glance for Jes’s\nhorse, saddlebags weighed down for a long journey. Flint was right – the\nBlackhats had abandoned the city.\nStyke discarded his saber and drew Ibana’s knife, forcing himself to\nbreathe evenly. At the sight of this, Jes let out a barking laugh. He sheathed\nhis own sword and pulled Styke’s big knife out of his belt, brandishing it\nmockingly.\nStyke’s mind flashed through all the mistakes he’d made last time –\ncoming into a fight wounded, overcome with anger, letting his emotions\noverrule his senses. He tried to expel all of that. He knew he was hurting,\ntired, but something felt righter about this fight. The Privileged that Ibana\nhad kidnapped had partially healed Styke’s crippling wounds. He was\nColonel Ben Styke again, the Mad Lancer of Landfall. He wouldn’t be put\ndown like a dog. He looked at his knife in Jes’s hand, the ring that touched\nthe handle. “Those are mine.”\n“Not anymore.” Jes spat the words as he came at Styke at a run. His\nknife flashed high in a feint, then plunged low for Styke’s belly.\nStyke tossed Ibana’s knife aside and grabbed the blade of his stolen\nweapon, stopping Jes dead in his tracks. He ignored the sharp blade biting\nthrough his flesh, scraping the bones of his fingers, and brought his right"

He ignored the sharp blade biting\nthrough his flesh, scraping the bones of his fingers, and brought his right\nfist around to connect with Jes’s nose. The Blackhat grand master’s head\nsnapped backward.\n“This isn’t about revenge,” Styke said. “This is because you’re an\nasshole.” Styke let go of the knife blade, snatching Jes’s sleeve with his\nbloody, slippery fingers, and jerked him forward. He slammed his fist once\nmore into the bridge of Jes’s nose and the grand master dropped into a heap\nat his feet.\nStyke leaned over and slid the ring off Jes’s thumb and over his own\nfinger, relieved to feel the familiar weight of it. He took his knife out of\nJes’s lifeless hand, and then with two quick strokes severed his head. He\nlifted it by the hair, ignoring the blood that soaked his shirt and trousers,\nand stared into the dead, faintly surprised eyes. He sighed, wishing he had\nmore than a few moments to relish the corpse at his feet, and looked up to\nfind Ibana on horseback, pushing her way to the front of the assembled\nBlackhats. He tossed her the head, which she caught easily in the crook of\nher arm. “We don’t have time to make a saddle,” he said.\nBehind him, the Blackhat with Ka-poel was noisily ill.\nIbana held the head at arm’s length, examining it, then nodded. “This\nwill do.”\n“Taniel,” Styke said with a nod, noting the blood-red color of his hand.\nHe remembered reading something about a rebel named the Red Hand years\nago. Funny that it should be the infamous Ghost of the Tristan Basin.\n“You’ve got a lot of secrets, don’t you?”\n“We all do,” Taniel responded, sheathing his sword.\nStyke eyed Jes’s Blackhat bodyguards. They were silent, shifting\nwordlessly in their saddles, staring at the headless body of their grand\nmaster. “Who’s in charge here?” Styke demanded.\n“Technically he is,” Taniel said.\nStyke turned to look at the Blackhat still mounted beside Ka-poel. The\nman was green-faced, wiping the corner of his mouth with his sleeve. He\ngave a sickly smile and waved at Styke. “Gold Rose Bravis at your service,\nMr. Styke.”\n“Colonel Styke,” Styke corrected, letting the word roll off his tongue.\nPit, he never thought he’d enjoy saying that so much.\nOne of Jes’s bodyguards, openly wearing his Silver Rose on his\nuniform, pointed at Bravis. “Jes said he was a traitor.”\nTo Styke’s surprise, Bravis slipped from his saddle and staggered over\nto the headless body of Fidelis Jes, nudging it with his toe. He whispered to\nStyke, “I’m working on the fly here, so just go with it.” He looked up at the\nbodyguards and in a loud voice said, “What did this shitheel tell you was\ngoing to happen to your families?” The uncomfortable silence continued,\nand so did Bravis. “Did he tell you they’d be evacuated from the city in due"

That there were more of us ready to help your friends and relatives\nmake their way away from Landfall should the garrison fall?\n“Or,” Bravis went on, “did he try to tell you that the Riflejacks would\nhold the city on their own while you all got as far as possible from the\nfighting?” He shook his head theatrically. “I can see those saddlebags.\nThousands of you are packed for a journey, coming down to escort some\nancient relic instead of protecting your homes. That sounds a lot like\nfleeing.”\nThe Silver Rose from earlier spoke up. “We’re not fleeing. We’re on the\nLady Chancellor’s business.”\n“The Lady Chancellor’s business is protecting Landfall,” Bravis\nsnapped back. He reached down to Jes’s body, looking for a moment like he\nmight vomit again, and plucked the Platinum Rose from Jes’s chest before\ndancing back just a little too quickly. He thrust his finger at Styke. “Fidelis\nJes has been telling you this man – this hero of Fatrasta – is a dangerous\ncriminal. Jes has been lying to you, just like he was lying to me, and this\nnext lie will lose us the city we love, the city full of our friends and\nfamilies.”\n“And what would you have us do?” the Silver Rose demanded.\n“A thousand heavily armed Blackhats? I’d have you protect the city.\nYou see these flags?” He pointed behind the Blackhats, where the Mad\nLancers had gathered up, and Jackal and the Riflejack bannerman rode side\nby side. “Ride with them. Ride with Ben Styke, hero of the Fatrastan\nRevolution. Ride with the Riflejacks, defenders of Landfall as appointed by\nthe Lady Chancellor herself. What would I have you do? Fight. Now get\nback to the main column, gather the rest of the Blackhats, and ready\nyourselves for a fight.”\nThree Blackhats, all of them wearing Silver Roses, conferred among\nthemselves. They turned to Bravis. “Who’s in command of the Blackhats?”\none of them asked.\nBravis drew himself up and pinned the Platinum Rose to his chest. “I\nam.”\nThere was a brief pause, and for a moment Styke thought they might\nlaugh in Bravis’s face. But the Silver Rose grimaced, then nodded. “As you\ncommand, grand master.” He turned, leading the rest of Jes’s bodyguards\nthrough the Mad Lancers and galloping back toward where the main body\nof the Blackhats had formed up about half a mile away.\nStyke joined Taniel beside Michel Bravis and took a long, hard look at\nhim. The Blackhat had forgettable features – a weak chin, round face, and\nlight brown hair mussed from a long ride. He was also trembling like a leaf.\nCompared to the corpse at their feet, he wasn’t a terribly convincing grand\nmaster. But, Styke supposed, he did have a head.\n“Did you just convince them to protect the godstone by convincing\nthem not to protect the godstone?” Taniel asked, tongue-in-cheek."

But, Styke supposed, he did have a head.\n“Did you just convince them to protect the godstone by convincing\nthem not to protect the godstone?” Taniel asked, tongue-in-cheek.\n“Yeah,” Bravis said shakily. “I think I did.” He looked between Styke\nand Taniel. “I take it you two know each other.”\nStyke looked at Taniel. Taniel wore a small smile, eyes very clearly\nsaying that he was not yet done with Styke. Styke ignored it. “Yeah.”\n“And you’re down here to intercept the Dynize that are south of us?”\nBravis asked.\n“Right on that account, too.”\nBravis looked about ready to faint. “Oh, thank Adom I got it all right.\nWhew.”\nStyke eyed Bravis, not sure he was ready to trust a Blackhat with\nanything, even if he was obviously with Taniel. In fact, he realized, that\nmight make him less trustworthy. “The godstone, is this the artifact Lady\nFlint sent me down here to protect?”\n“It is,” Taniel confirmed.\n“Do we know anything else about the Dynize we’re going to face?”\n“Only that there’s at least four regiments.” Taniel lifted his chin in the\ndirection of the Blackhat army. “And that, with the Blackhats, you’ve got an\nextra thousand men and two Privileged.”\nStyke went and found the knife he’d borrowed from Ibana and put it in\nhis saddlebags, taking a few moments to clean the deep gash along his\nfingers and bind it with a handkerchief. It stung badly, and it would hurt his\nability to fight, but he could still flex his fingers.\nHe checked the blade on his own knife and cleaned the blood off it on\nJes’s jacket. “Blackhats are little more than a bunch of thugs. They’re not\ngoing to be much good against four regiments of these Dynize. The bastards\nare tough, and they do not break.”\n“Make them break,” Taniel said.\nStyke weighed the odds in his head. A thousand Blackhats. Eight\nhundred Riflejack and Mad Lancer cavalry. A few hundred Fatrastan\nsoldiers already guarding the godstone. Two-to-one numbers in favor of the\nDynize did not please him. “I’ve had worse odds,” he said, heading for his\nhorse. “But you’re coming with me, Two-shot, and I want you to scatter the\nbrains of any Privileged those bloody Dynize have with them.”\nBy the time Michel returned to the dig site, the land-barge and its cargo had\nalready begun to move, creeping at a disappointing speed across the fields\nwhile horses pulled and the whips of teamsters rose and fell. Laborers\nhelped push from behind, or rushed on ahead to smooth the ground with\nhands and shovels.\nThe monolith was moving, but Michel could already see it was going\nnowhere quick.\nHe forced himself to ignore the murmurs of the Blackhats behind him\nand rode up to Major Cole, who stared for a long time at the Platinum Rose\non Michel’s chest.

If he survived the day wearing this Platinum Rose,\nhe promised himself, he’d be a very happy man.\n“Sir,” Major Cole finally said, saluting.\nMichel put as much bluster as he dared behind his voice. “Major Cole,\nwe’ve received almost two thousand riders as backup from Landfall.\nColonel Styke is taking command of the defense of the monolith. I asked\nhim to keep the fight as far from us as possible, but I’m going to keep your\nsoldiers in reserve here with the land-barge in case the Dynize make it past\nthem.”\n“With the what?”\n“The land-barge.” Michel felt his cheeks redden. “I just thought it\nlooked like…”\n“A barge on land,” Cole said with a reluctant nod. “Yeah, I get it. It fits.\nWe’ve all just been calling it the big wagon.”\n“Mine is much better. Keep your men nearby, Major Cole.” Michel\nslowly trailed off, watching as orders were shouted, some confusion about\nthe chain of command was cleared up, and then the Blackhats rode off\nbehind Styke’s cavalry. He looked around, realizing that Cole had already\ngone to see to his own men, and found that his only companion was Ka-\npoel. “Did Taniel go with Styke?” he asked.\nKa-poel nodded.\n“Right. That doesn’t leave us with much if the Dynize manage to break\nthrough the Mad Lancers.”\nAnother nod, this one slightly more solemn.\nMichel’s horse suddenly lurched under him, nearly knocking him from\nthe saddle, and he decided he’d had enough. “To the pit with this,” he said,\nclimbing down once the animal had calmed. “I am not riding on that thing\nany longer. Horses were meant to pull carriages, not be ridden.”\nKa-poel didn’t look terribly impressed. She turned her own horse\naround to face the south, then pulled out her rucksack and began to\nrummage through it again while Michel approached the land-barge, dodging\nlaborers and ropes. He pulled himself onto the platform, then walked\nalongside the horizontal monolith, doing his best not to touch it, until he\nreached where Professor Cressel stood at the very front of the land-barge.\nThe professor pushed his spectacles up, looking to the south. “Are we\ngoing to outrun the Dynize?” Cressel asked.\nMichel looked pointedly at the ground, moving past at nearly a snail’s\npace. He should be grateful they were moving at all, but he fought down his\nown rising panic and replied, “I’m afraid not, Professor.”\n“Do we have enough men to protect the monolith?” Cressel asked.\nMichel opened his mouth, thought better of his answer, and changed his\n“no” to a “maybe.” “Landfall sent a couple of Privileged. That should even\nthe odds.” Unless they have Privileged of their own.\n“Ah, excellent.” Cressel patted the monolith affectionately. “We\nabsolutely cannot let this fall into enemy hands. It’s too important.”"

It’s too important.”\nMichel leaned on the monolith without thinking, jumping as a spark of\nstatic seemed to leap from the stone to his shoulder, then rubbed his hands\ntogether to try to get rid of the distasteful feeling the spark had left behind.\nThe whispering in the back of his head had returned, no longer drowned out\nby the excitement of the move. He wondered if maybe coming up here had\nbeen a stupid idea, and looking up found that Ka-poel was riding slowly\nalongside, the reins of his horse tied to her saddle. She seemed to sense his\ndiscomfort and gestured to the horse.\n“I’ll stay here,” Michel said. “Less of a chance of breaking my neck,\nthank you.” The land-barge suddenly lurched, nearly pitching him to the\nground and beneath the wheels. He grabbed Cressel to steady himself.\n“Are you all right, Gold Rose?” Cressel asked.\n“It’s grand master now,” Michel said absently, pointing to the Platinum\nRose pinned to his chest. “And no. I hate myself, I hate this stupid\nmonolith, and I hate the bloody Dynize for the fact that I can now see them\nand – oh shit, Ka-poel, I can see them!”\nKa-poel raised her head, looking toward the south, where a dust cloud\nnow enveloped the sky not a mile away. The distant report of musket fire\nreached them and Ka-poel went back to digging in her satchel.\n“Did you say Ka-poel?” Cressel asked curiously. “Ka is a Dynize title.\nIs she a Dynize? Are you a Dynize?” Cressel’s eyes suddenly widened.\n“That’s a Dynize bone-eye title. That woman is a blood sorcerer?”\n“I wouldn’t worry about it too much,” Michel said.\n“Blood sorcery! That would explain so much. It could be the key to\nwhat we’ve been missing, I…” His ramblings dropped in tone to a mere\nmutter, and Michel was content to let them stay that way. Nervously he\nwatched the dust cloud, quickly becoming black from powder smoke, and\nsilently willed the teamsters to move the land-barge a little bit faster.\nA Silver Rose rode up beside Styke, eyeing him and the banner flying from\nJackal’s lance before giving a nervous salute. “Sir, we’re not trained\ncavalry. I’m not sure how effective we’re going to be against the Dynize.”\n“You’ll be plenty effective,” Styke replied, not trusting himself to look\nthe Blackhat in the eye. He considered the irony of him, here, giving orders\nto a contingent of Blackhats instead of grinding their bones to dust, and\nthen forced himself to think of the much happier fact of Jes’s head now in a\nsack hanging from Ibana’s saddle.\n“We haven’t exactly trained for this.”\n“No,” Styke said, “but you’ll manage anyway. Can your men shoot\nfrom horseback?”\n“Most of them, yes.”\n“Good. Split into two groups. I’m not going to bother throwing you at\ntheir center – your men aren’t capable of such a charge, and your horses"

I’m not going to bother throwing you at\ntheir center – your men aren’t capable of such a charge, and your horses\ndon’t deserve it. I want each group to peel off from our main column and\ncircle the enemy flanks. You’ll act as light skirmishers. Hit them from the\nsides, and hit them hard with everything you have. Fire at will and all that.\nPut one of your Privileged on either side and tell them to focus on any\nPrivileged the enemy may have, and then to turn on the infantry.”\nThe Blackhat seemed relieved not to be participating in a charge. “I\nthink we can do that,” he said.\nStyke reached over and snatched the Blackhat by the arm, nearly\nyanking him out of the saddle. “You’ll know you can do it,” he growled.\n“You bastards have been gunning for me for two weeks, and if you don’t\nshow some spine and make these Dynize bleed, I’ll hunt you down\npersonally when I’m done with this and put your head in the same sack I\nput Jes’s. Understand?”\n“Yes, sir,” the Blackhat managed to choke out.\nStyke pushed him right back in his saddle and gave him a toothy grin.\n“And if you keep their flanks off my ass for long enough to win this battle\nthen maybe, just maybe, we can be friends. Now go make sure your men\nunderstand all that very clearly.”\nThe Blackhat rode off, and Styke focused on the approaching Dynize.\nThe infantry were coming on at a double march, arranged in four solid\ncolumns that, as Styke drew closer, gradually slowed and fanned out into\nrows. Styke blinked through sweat dripping into his eyes and pushed back\nagainst the niggles of dread and doubt that exhaustion let permeate his\nbrain.\nOutnumbered two to one. Cavalry against infantry – infantry that, it\nseemed, refused to break in the face of superior enemy action. Routing an\nenemy was the best chance cavalry had against such odds and Styke did not\nlike their prospects one bit.\n“Taniel!” he called, turning in his saddle to look for the powder mage.\nHe discovered Taniel about twenty feet behind him, standing in the stirrups,\na rifle held to his shoulder, sighting down the barrel as Ibana held his reins.\n“What is he doing?” Styke shouted.\n“His job,” Ibana responded. “They have six Privileged and —”\nTaniel’s rifle jumped, the crack making Ibana flinch slightly and then\nrub one finger in her ear. Taniel watched the horizon, focused, rifle still\nraised, his lips moving as he counted silently. Several seconds later he\nlowered his rifle and immediately began to reload. “They have four\nPrivileged,” he reported.\nStyke laughed despite himself. “Jackal, relay orders. I want every one of\nours with an unbroken lance to form a spearhead. Behind them, the\nRiflejack cuirassiers, then after them the dragoons. Line us in a column\ntight and hard, narrow like a flared lance. Six rows of four, then six rows of\nfive, six rows of six, and on. Wedge formation.”"

They won’t\nknow what hit ’em.”\nTaniel raised his rifle to his shoulder, aimed, then looked over at Styke.\n“You really are a bloody madman.”\n“Everyone keeps telling me that,” Styke said. “Jackal, get me a new\nlance. I’ll tip the wedge.”\nStyke’s people were outnumbered two to one. The Dynize, he decided,\nshould have brought more men.\nCHAPTER 63\nV\nlora used her sorcery to ignite a tiny bit of powder almost a mile away.\nIt detonated, and chain reaction was almost instantaneous as the rest of\nthe powder in the ship of the line’s magazine went up with it, tearing the\nship in half and hurling the entire mast so far through the air that it almost\nstruck dry land.\nThe kickback was also instantaneous. Vlora felt it deep in her bones, the\nforce of the explosion like a wine barrel knocking her down a flight of\nstairs. She nearly fell from her perch on the edge of the wall, fingers\ngripping the stone with all the strength she could manage. Her head\npounded, the wound in her leg, a graze on her shoulder, and a dozen other\nscrapes and bruises threatening to break through her powder trance as she\nwas overwhelmed with the sensations thrown at her from every direction.\nA hook suddenly clattered over the wall immediately beside her, and she\nspared a glance to find a longboat at the base of the fort, a Dynize\ninfantryman already a quarter of the way up the rope by the time she could\npull her knife and cut it. There was a startled scream, then a splash, and\nthree Riflejacks suddenly joined her position and fired down into the\nlongboat while grappling hooks continued to be flung over the wall.\nThe same was happening all up and down the wall. For almost half an\nhour the Dynize had tried to gain purchase. The fort was surrounded by\ncorpses and the wreckage of longboats, but more persisted in their attempts.\nOver on the land, Olem’s men had been driven all the way back to the\ncauseway, where they had now dug in, refusing to budge, fighting in fierce\nhand-to-hand with the Dynize.\n“Colonel coming in!” a voice yelled.\nVlora forced herself off the ramparts, barely able to hold her own\nweight on the railing as she made her way down into the muster yard. The\nmain gate was opened briefly and Olem staggered in, supported on either\nside by a pair of privates. His face was covered in blood, his jacket was\ngone, and one arm was in a sling. She hurried over to him, grabbing him\naround the neck and pulling him into an embrace.\n“Report,” she whispered.\n“Still alive,” he grunted. “I left Major Supin in command with orders to"

She wasn’t sure where it came from – fear of seeing him like\nthis, or joy that he seemed to be in better shape than he looked.\n“No,” Olem replied, “my blood ruined my rolling papers.” He took his\narms off the privates and waved them away, testing one foot tentatively\nbefore limping over to a bench along the inner wall and sagging into it.\nVlora sat down beside him, allowing herself a moment’s rest.\n“You look as bad as I feel,” she said.\nOlem looked up sharply. “Those ships out there. That was you?”\nVlora nodded.\nOlem suddenly turned, grasping her by the face and forcing her to look\nhim in the eye. He studied her for several moments before letting go.\n“You’re in shock,” he said.\n“I’m fine,” she tried to assure him. Distantly, she was aware that he was\nprobably right. Detonating so much powder had consequences, even for\nsomeone experienced like her. “Okay, maybe I’m not fine.”\n“Don’t do that again,” he warned. “The kickback could kill you.”\n“You know,” she said, trying to give her voice a joking tone, “I’m the\npowder mage here.”\n“And, when you were thinking more clearly, you told me in no\nuncertain terms not to let you pull this kind of shit. An entire magazine\ngoing up is no joke.”\nVlora turned away, wishing he didn’t worry so much. This was the time\nfor fighting, not concern. Regrets could be had later. “I’m still alive,” she\nsaid. “And I wouldn’t have done it if we didn’t need the help. How’s it\ngoing out there?” She flinched as a Dynize cannonball tore through the\nnortheastern wall, sending bits of masonry and bodies flying. Within\nmoments there were Dynize at the breach, but the Riflejacks beat them to it,\nfilling the space with a wall of bayonets.\n“Not great,” Olem said. “The Riflejacks are holding together, but the\ngarrison has taken a massive pounding. They’re wavering, and I don’t\nblame them. The bloody Dynize should have conceded the fight an hour\nago, but they just keep coming.”\nVlora watched as a Dynize threw himself over the wall, musket in hand,\nonly to be pincushioned by Riflejack bayonets. “It’s sorcery,” she said.\n“You’re certain?”\n“It has to be. No one is that brave, or that stupid – no one. Norrine said\nshe hasn’t seen a single Dynize turn and run. I think it’s the bone-eye.”\n“Have you been able to find him?”\n“Believe me, I’ve tried. Ka-sedial’s ship is three miles out. Taniel could\nmake that shot. I can’t.”"

Is Ka-sedial working\nalone?”\n“I’ve sensed a few other bone-eyes. Managed to kill two. Still looking\nfor the third. Unless we break the will of these bastards, they’re going to\noverrun us.”\n“They don’t have much left,” Olem said hopefully. “Half their fleet is at\nthe bottom of the ocean or on its way, and there aren’t many longboats left\nin the water.”\n“All they have to do is overrun us,” Vlora said. “And they’re real\ndamned close.”\nAnother Dynize managed to gain the top of the wall. Vlora’s heart leapt\nin her throat as she realized this wasn’t a normal foot soldier, but a leather-\nclad dragonman. He was a big, brutish man with a long, delicate-looking\nwhite sword, and he cut through several Riflejacks before Vlora could even\nreach for her pistol. By the time she had it out and loaded, the dragonman\nhad gone down beneath a hail of close-range rifle fire, but he’d done more\ndamage than twenty Dynize soldiers.\n“I need to be back up there,” Vlora said, getting to her feet.\nOlem grabbed her hand. “You’re not in any shape to do anything but get\nin the way.”\n“Commanders aren’t just there to fight. They’re to be seen.” She limped\nback toward the stairs, only to come up short at the sound of an inhuman\ngroan that echoed across the bay. The sound sent a shiver down her spine,\nand she ignored her pain, snorting an extra charge of powder, forcing\nherself up the stairs to the ramparts. What she saw there took her breath\naway.\nAcross the bay, half the ships at port were on fire, smoke billowing high\nand black into the sky. But that wasn’t what caught her attention. Several of\nthose burning ships were no longer moored, and were actively being pulled\nout to sea by the departing tide. She rubbed her eyes, uncertain she could\ntrust them as she saw tiny figures running along the decks, untangling\nrigging, and trying to put out the fires.\n“What the…” Vlora stared, openmouthed, as a ship belching black\nsmoke from two sails, with the flames quickly spreading, creaked and\ngroaned in a savage turn, sweeping through the bay waters, coming within\nspitting distance of the walls of Fort Nied. Its prow crashed through dozens\nof longboats, forcing the occupants to leap into the water, where they were\nquickly dragged under by the weight of their armor.\nA handful of sailors worked frantically to keep the ship steady, while the\nfamiliar figure of Vallencian stood on the aft-castle, legs planted, laughing\nmadly as he fought the wheel.\nThe merchantman was quickly past the fort, heading at an alarming\nspeed out past the breaker walls. Another merchantman followed suit, then\nanother, while a fourth was quickly abandoned by the sailors trying to keep\nit under control as the flames grew too perilous. It drifted madly, crashing\ninto breakers."

It drifted madly, crashing\ninto breakers.\n“What the pit are they doing?” a soldier behind Vlora asked.\nVlora watched, awed, trying to find words. “The Ice Baron is sacrificing\nhis fleet to save this battle.” She remembered his comment about the tide\ngoing out, then balled her hands into fists. There was no way he was\ncoming back from this – even if he abandoned ship, he wouldn’t be able to\nswim back, not against the tide. It was a suicide mission for his ships and\nhim and his sailors, and they had to know it.\nThe remaining Dynize ships quickly turned their cannons on\nVallencian’s merchantmen, but to little effect. The merchantmen were\nalready ablaze, nothing more than floating battering rams, and Vallencian’s\nship collided full-on with a ship of the line that had managed to avoid Fort\nNied’s guns all afternoon. The sound was terrible, a horrible screech like a\nhundred demons clawing their way from the pit. Both Dynize and\nVallencian’s sailors leapt into the water, abandoning the wreckage as both\nships began to sink.\nThe second of Vallencian’s merchantmen crushed the forecastle of\nanother warship, while the third cut behind yet another Dynize ship,\ndestroying the rudder and crushing the rear windows of the aft-castle.\nFighting seemed to grind to a halt as men from both sides stopped to\nwatch the terrible collisions. Vlora gained the edge of the wall, firing her\npistol at an officer in a longboat below her, then shaking her head as she felt\nsomething snap within her.\nAt first she thought it was something physical within her – a bone, or a\nligament, or just about anything that could go wrong. When she didn’t feel\nany pain, she looked around her, searching for the source of that snap. It\ntook her several moments to realize that something had changed.\nThe Dynize, for the first time all afternoon, suddenly wavered.\nIt wasn’t immediate. Slowly, like a flame exposed to a gradually stiffer\nbreeze, the Dynize offensive seemed to flutter and flex. Their shouting\nbecame uncertain, their momentum stalled. Minutes passed as the fighting\ngrew more desperate and then, across the water where Olem’s troops still\nbarely held the end of the causeway, Vlora saw a Dynize soldier throw\ndown his musket and flee back toward the beach.\nHe was joined by others and then, like a candle being blown out, the\nentire Dynize army routed.\nThe Riflejacks and garrison seemed to get a second wind, redoubling\ntheir efforts and giving chase. The Dynize soldiers reached the water, some\nof them clamoring into the few remaining longboats while others realized\nthe hopelessness of trying to swim away and turned to organize a defensive.\nIt was too late, and Vlora’s men hit them from behind, forcing them back\ninto the ocean.\nVlora watched Dynize soldiers in their heavy breastplates drown by the\nscore, unwilling to comprehend the horror of such a fate. She looked toward\nthe wreckage of Vallencian’s ship, knowing it would be days before she\nwould be able to mount a rescue, and took a deep breath."

She looked toward\nthe wreckage of Vallencian’s ship, knowing it would be days before she\nwould be able to mount a rescue, and took a deep breath.\nSomehow, some way, they had managed to win the day.\nStyke drew his carbine one-handed, sighting along it for half a second\nbefore pulling the trigger. He was past the puff of smoke a moment later,\nand accompanied by the crack of a hundred other carbines as the lancers\nand cuirassiers opened fire on the front line of the Dynize infantry.\nThe Dynize, falling into a defensive formation, fired back a single\nvolley. Styke felt a bullet slam into the meat of his left shoulder and pushed\naway the sharp, sudden pain, rotating his arm to make sure it would still\nwork. Behind him horses screamed and fell, and he holstered his carbine\nwithout looking back and took his lance in hand, lowering it at the now-\nreduced Dynize front line.\nAmrec leapt a wounded infantryman and Styke lowered his lance,\ntearing out a Dynize throat with the tip and driving it into the face of the\nnext Dynize. He kept his grip tight, aiming true until the lance was snapped\njust past the haft. He threw the useless weapon at an infantryman trying to\nbring his bayonet to bear on Amrec’s chest, then drew his heavy saber,\nswinging it with enough force to decapitate a Dynize officer.\nHe spurred Amrec forward, unwilling to give up his momentum, and\nplowed through the front eight rows of infantry until he was among the\nDynize who had not yet been ordered to lower their weapons. The Dynize\nscrambled to defend themselves, officers shouting and swearing while they\nattempted to halt the vicious charge.\nStyke hazarded a glance over his shoulder. Jackal was still right behind\nhim, along with the Riflejack bannerman, but Ibana and a huge number of\nhis remaining lancers had disappeared in the chaos. He gritted his teeth and\nbent from his saddle, slashing beneath the arm of an infantryman, then\nwaved his sword. “Forward, you dogs!” he roared. “Forward!”\nHis cavalry continued to plow onward. Styke caught sight of a Dynize\nPrivileged, white gloves raised above his head, a scarf wrapped around his\nface to protect his nose from the powder smoke. Styke angled Amrec\ntoward the Privileged, determined to run him down before he could do any\nreal damage, only to watch him tumble from his saddle with a bullet wound\nthrough his chest.\nTwo-shot, it seemed, was still hard at work.\nStyke forced his way through the press, Amrec leaping and kicking with\nthe nimbleness of a Gurlish racing horse. They plowed through three more\nlines and then suddenly he was free, riding across open farmland behind the\nDynize position. He pulled Amrec around and watched as a few hundred of\nhis cavalry managed to extricate themselves from the tangle.\nHe spared a glance in either direction, satisfied to see the flash of fire\nand lightning, along with the bloom of powder smoke, as the Blackhats and\ntheir Privileged tore into the Dynize flanks.

The Dynize attention was split between both cavalry and\nskirmishers, and they didn’t appear to have any Privileged left to answer\nthose accompanying the Blackhats.\nStyke counted to forty to allow enough of his cavalry to emerge from\nthe Dynize ranks before waving his sword over his head. “Form up!” he\nbellowed, and spurred Amrec back into the fray before the Dynize officers\ncould turn their lines around to face him.\nHe rode roughshod through the confused Dynize columns as they\nattempted to fight both riders and the sorcery on their flanks. Halfway\nthrough he spotted Ibana, jacket bloody with a broken lance in one hand\nand a smallsword in the other, having formed up several dozen unhorsed\ncavalry into a loose circle, which was in danger of being overrun by the\nDynize. Styke led his remaining cavalry straight to them.\nA Dynize bayonet caught Styke on the thigh just as he reached Ibana’s\nmen. The pain came quick and hot, and he snatched the musket out of the\nstartled soldier’s hands and swung it around, cracking it across the man’s\nhead with enough force to break the stock. Another bayonet was thrust\ntoward his face, barely missing his eye, and then a musket stock, swung like\nclub, slammed into his cheek. He reeled back, seeing stars, and swung his\nsaber blindly.\nLightning struck so close that it almost turned Styke and Amrec into a\npillar of ash. Fire followed it a moment later in a column as thick as a man,\ncrashing down from the heavens, zigzagging its way through the Dynize\nranks. Infantry cooked instantly in their armor, and Styke’s nostrils were\nfilled with the smell of burned flesh and hair. As suddenly as he’d been\nclose to overwhelmed, the field around him was empty of enemies.\nHe wheeled Amrec around, looking wildly. The Blackhats, their\nnumbers greatly reduced, had managed to make it all the way around the\nDynize flank and come up behind them. One of their Privileged was\nbleeding from a gunshot wound, but the fingers of them both continued to\ntwitch and gesture, raining death among the Dynize. The fire and lightning\nspread outward from Styke’s position in the center, bringing ruin to the\nentirety of the Dynize infantry with startling speed.\nStyke slid from his saddle, watching the Privileged work, and limped\nover to Ibana. She knelt by the side of a Riflejack whom Styke did not\nrecognize, holding the man’s hand as he writhed in pain. The better part of\nthe Riflejack’s left arm had been taken off by an enemy sword, and the rest\nwould have to be amputated.\nStyke looked around at the carnage, wondering if he would be sick from\nthe sudden feeling of elation that rose within his chest. The smell of the\ndead, the wind in his hair, the blood on his steel: It made him feel vibrant\nand alive like nothing in the world had ever done for him.

He thought about\nthe guards at the labor camp and all the men he’d allowed to beat and\nbelittle him just to try to reach parole.\n“I shouldn’t have stayed,” he said, breathing deeply of the smell of\nsorcery and burned corpses. “I should have fought my way out years ago.”\n“What are you going on about?” Ibana demanded.\nStyke lifted his chin to the chaos, watching as Taniel Two-shot, no\nlonger on horseback, used a bayoneted rifle to tear through a whole\ncompany of Dynize infantry on his own. It reminded him of the grace with\nwhich Lady Flint fought, though somehow quicker and more terrifying. “If\nyou can’t break them,” he said.\n“Grind their bones to dust beneath your hooves,” Ibana finished, not\nlifting her eyes from the wounded Riflejack. “Did we win?”\nBetween the Blackhat Privileged, the remaining cavalry, and Taniel,\nthey were mopping up the last of the Dynize. It was a stark reminder of just\nhow quickly sorcery changed the tide of battle, and how easily it could have\nbeen Styke’s bones turned to ash from a Dynize Privileged, if not for Two-\nshot to even the odds.\n“Yeah,” he said, drawing his knife and kneeling down beside the\nRiflejack and sizing up the arm that needed to be amputated. “Bite down on\nyour belt, son. This is gonna hurt, but it’ll be a cleaner cut. We won.”\nCHAPTER 64\nV\nlora stood in the prow of a longboat as it did a circuit through the water\nsurrounding Fort Nied. The slow strokes of the rowers left barely any\nwake behind them yet still managed to stir corpses to the top of the water,\ntheir bloated forms facedown, bobbing gently, their teal uniforms stained by\nthe blood still seeping from their bodies. Somewhere off her port side the\nwater suddenly exploded in movement as sharks emerged to fight over a\ncorpse. Riflemen behind her stood, took aim, and shot into the water. The\nfoaming frenzy increased for several seconds and then died down to leave\nthe bay placid, gentle waves lapping bodies toward the shore.\nVlora’s own body was a collection of aches, sharp pains, and\ndeveloping bruises. She wondered if this was what it felt like to be\ntrampled, and dug in her pocket for a powder charge, pinching just the\nslightest bit off the top and snorting it from between her fingers. The\nstitches in the shrapnel wound in her leg stopped throbbing.\n“It’s a complete waste,” a voice said behind her.\n“I disagree,” a second voice responded. “We can rebuild this wall\nwithout lessening the structural integrity of the fort.”\n“Are you mad? We don’t have access to the kind of sorcery that made\nthis fort as strong as it was. I say we level the whole thing and bring in the\nbest stonemasons money can buy. We’ll build something better. With\nmodern techniques we don’t even need sorcery to make the walls nearly\nimpervious to straight shot.”\n“You’ve been reading too much of that idiot Yaddel,” the second voice\nsaid. “Modern construction is incredible, but it can’t beat sorcery.”\n“Yaddel is a visionary!”"

No doubt the engineers behind her\nsaw more damage with their experienced eye. She gave a soft sigh at their\narguing and tuned it out, glancing over the bay as some thirty or more\nlongboats just like hers traversed the waters, fishing out corpses with hooks\nand nets, riflemen shooting every shark that surfaced.\nBeyond the bay, well past the range of her few remaining cannons and\nthe flotsam of what used to be their flotilla, the rest of the Dynize fleet sat at\nanchor, swarming with sailors making repairs. She counted just eight capital\nships and two times that number in support frigates.\nSince the Dynize army had finally routed last night, she hadn’t heard a\nword from Ka-sedial. No white flags. No suit for peace. Not even a request\nto barter for the dead and wounded. The Dynize fleet simply waited, and\nVlora didn’t mind admitting to herself that their silence was unnerving.\nShe tried to forget it, at least for the moment. She and her men had won\na damned hard battle last night, and she allowed a smile to creep onto her\nface. The melancholy that gripped her now would be gone in a few days’\ntime, and her head would be back to the logistics of running an army –\nproviding food, shelter, and pay, and bringing their numbers back to a full\nbrigade.\nShe scowled at the Landfall docks and the smoke still rising from\nseveral destroyed ships. Only a few remained untouched by the fires, while\ndozens were a complete loss, no doubt representing the imminent\nbankruptcy of several shipping companies. Fortunately, none of that was\nher problem.\nVlora’s absent-minded inspection of the fort and environs suddenly\nfocused on a body washed up on the shore not far from the causeway that\nattached Fort Nied to the mainland. She turned to her rowers. “Over there,”\nshe ordered.\n“But ma’am,” an engineer said, “we’re not done with our inspection of\nthe fort.”\n“You can finish after you drop me off,” Vlora said. “I want a full report\nby the end of the evening – one from each of you.” Conscious of the sharks\nprowling beneath the layer of flotsam and bodies, she waited until the\nlongboat had reached the shallows, then she leapt into the water. She waded\nashore and fell on her knees beside a body.\nIt belonged to an enormous man with a dark, soaked beard, colorful\nclothes, and the thick tatters of a bearskin still clinging to his shoulders. His\nface was pale as death, his chest still.\n“Damn it, Vallencian,” Vlora muttered, feeling the first real pang of\nhorror that had struck her through the sea of bodies. “You were about the\nonly decent person in this whole damned city.” She called to a nearby squad\nfrom the garrison that was sorting corpses by uniform on the rocky beach.

A\nsergeant with a squat, ugly face and shaved head waddled over, hooked\nspear thrown over his shoulder.\n“What can I do for you, ma’am?”\n“This is one of mine,” she said. “I want him put in the morgue with the\nother Riflejack officers.”\nThe sergeant scowled appraisingly at the body. “Right you are, ma’am,\nbut it doesn’t seem like a good idea to put him in the morgue.”\n“Why not?”\nThe sergeant produced a mirror from his pocket and knelt down,\nthrusting the mirror up in front of Vallencian’s nose. A thin film of fog\nappeared. “Because he’s not dead.”\nVlora felt a wave of relief sweep over her. Finally, some good news.\n“He’s half-drowned. Get me a surgeon. Go!”\nThe sergeant scurried off, and Vlora bent over Vallencian, searching his\nchest for the barest hint of movement. If she held very still, and squinted,\nshe could see it. “Crashed one of your ships into the Dynize and then\nmanaged to swim all the way back against the tide. You’re a damned\nworkhorse, you know that?”\nOne of the garrison doctors soon arrived with assistants. He pumped\nVallencian’s lungs carefully with glass tubing, then they carried him back\ntoward Fort Nied on a stretcher. Vlora remained out on the beach, telling\nherself that she should accompany Vallencian until she knew whether he\nwas going to survive, but unwilling to watch him die if it came to that.\nThe shadows began to grow long, and Vlora smelled the familiar scent\nof tobacco before she heard the crunch of boots on gravel. She turned to\nfind Olem picking his way gingerly over the rocky terrain, his head\nbandaged and his arm in a sling.\n“Glad to see you’re up and walking,” Vlora said.\n“I’m not glad to see you are,” Olem replied. “You should be resting.”\n“There’s work to be done.”\n“Like standing out here, staring at the bodies?”\nVlora snorted. She wanted to reach out and take Olem by the hand,\nretire to a hotel room up on the plateau, and spend the next two weeks with\nhim recovering in each other’s arms. “I went with the engineers to examine\nNied’s fortifications from the water.”\n“And?”\n“Doesn’t look great. Any news from the Dynize?”\n“Not a peep. I’d hoped you saw some sort of indication that they were\nready to talk.”\nVlora turned back toward the ocean. The Dynize ships remained, quietly\nmenacing, as if daring any of the unburned ships in port to make a run for\nit. “Not that I’ve heard. Do we have casualty reports?”\n“Thirty-five hundred wounded, seven hundred dead.”\nVlora perked up. “That’s far better than I expected.”\n“It’s only Riflejack numbers,” Olem responded sourly.\n“Oh.” Vlora fought the sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach.

Recovery would be weeks at best, and they’d lose a number of\nthe wounded to disease, infection, or blood loss. “The garrison?”\n“The garrison,” Olem said slowly, “was hit hard. They’ve got fewer\nwounded than us, but about eight thousand dead. They’re not used to this\nkind of fighting.”\n“Nobody is used to this kind of fighting,” Vlora responded, shaking her\nhead. “I’ve never seen anything like it – soldiers that just would not break,\nno matter how many dead we piled in front of them. I saw Ka-poel a couple\nof hours ago. She told me that it was definitely blood magic, spread out\nacross half a dozen bone-eyes. The ship Vallencian plowed into must have\ncontained one of the more powerful practitioners, and his death shattered\ntheir concentration.”\n“At least that’s a mystery solved.”\n“I’m not sure I like knowing,” Vlora said. “All my training – pit, all\nAdran strategy – is based off breaking a less-well-trained enemy. If the\nenemy will not break, then how do we win?”\n“We won yesterday.”\n“Barely.”\n“Can Ka-poel replicate the Dynize sorcery?”\n“She’s powerful enough, that’s for sure. But she’s not formally trained.\nEverything she can do is self-taught, and she says providing a backbone to\nten thousand men is a challenge she’s never even considered before. All her\nattention right now is focused on the godstone.”\n“And?” Olem asked, ashing his cigarette and lowering himself with a\ngroan to the sand beside Vlora.\n“And what?” Vlora said with a frustrated shrug. “None of us are\nPrivileged. The two remaining Privileged that the Blackhats left behind\ndon’t want to go near the thing. We don’t know exactly what it is or how it\nworks. I don’t even want to think about it.” She put her head in her hands\nand rubbed her eyes. “Speaking of the Blackhats…”\n“We don’t know where they are,” Olem answered. “I sent out riders.\nBest guess is Lindet retreated to a safe distance and, once she finds out\nwe’ve won, she’ll return to the city.”\n“And bring thousands of angry, armed men with her.” Vlora gritted her\nteeth, wondering if she was strong enough for a power struggle so soon\nafter the end of this battle. “I’ll kill her before I let her take control of the\ngodstone.”\n“Does she know that?”\n“I told her as much when I threatened to arrest her.”\n“So much for the element of surprise.” Olem flicked a cigarette butt\ntoward the water. “I saw them carrying Vallencian toward the fort. They\nsaid he’s still alive.”\n“For now,” Vlora responded.\n“I’m going to go check on him. Come find me when you decide to stop\nwatching them collect the bodies.”\nVlora helped Olem to his feet, then watched him head back toward Fort\nNied, before attempting to collect herself emotionally.

You brought the\nbest damned riflemen in the world, and it’s the only reason most of us are\nstill alive today.”\nSomewhere down the beach, members of the garrison had started a\ndriftwood bonfire. Fire for the Dynize dead. Earth for the Riflejacks and\ngarrison. The price of victory.\nThe price of saving a city of a million people.\nCHAPTER 65\nS\ntyke lay on his back in the long grass of a Fatrastan floodplain and stared\nup at the blue, cloudless sky, meditating on the events of the last two\nweeks. Somewhere off to his left Ibana was yelling at someone, though he\ncouldn’t imagine who because the rest of the Mad Lancers were either laid\nup in the surgeries or off in the city looting Blackhat munitions depots. In\nhis head, he imagined the look on Fidelis Jes’s face when he realized how\nmuch shit the lancers had managed to steal before the Blackhats returned to\nthe city, and then he remembered that Fidelis Jes’s face was attached to a\nhead in a bag, quite possibly still tied to Ibana’s saddle.\nThe thought brought a smile to Styke’s face. Jes’s corpse was probably\nalready burning on a mass pyre, anonymous, with a thousand others south\nof the city. A fitting end for a man who dedicated his life to making sure\neveryone knew and feared him.\n“What are you grinning about?”\nStyke turned his head to find Ibana standing over him, hands on her\nhips, looking nonplussed. “Thinking about Jes.”\n“Of course you are. By the way, that head is starting to stink. What do\nyou want to do with it?”\n“Would it be crass to ram it on the end of my lance and ride through\nLandfall all day tomorrow?”\n“Sounds perfectly suitable to me. We have a problem, though.”\nStyke sat up, fighting a brief dizzy spell. “What is it?”\n“The Mad Lancers always ride with three hundred. We started off with\ntwo hundred and forty-three yesterday, and now we’re down to a little over\na hundred and fifty. Where are we going to find more men?”\n“That’s your job.”\n“Like the pit it is,” Ibana said. She stalked away, then stalked back. Her\npacing continued for a few moments before she stopped. “You know, those\nRiflejack cavalry were quite good.”\n“I’m not sure what Flint would do to you if she found you recruiting\nfrom her ranks, but I wouldn’t blame her.”\n“As if,” Ibana scoffed.\n“You want to fight her?”\n“… No.”\nStyke turned, feeling the crack and pop of his spine, then lay back down\non the soft grass.

In fact, what about those\nBlackhats that rode with us against the Dynize?

Jaim?” Styke asked. “I don’t remember, either. Pit, she was good-\nlooking, though.”\nIbana kicked him in the ribs. He clutched at them, laughing, until it felt\nlike the movement had burst a couple of stitches on his shoulder. He\nchecked his shirt, noting a new splotch of blood, and went back to staring at\nthe sky.\n“Why the pit are you down there?” Ibana asked.\n“Can’t smell the burning corpses,” Styke answered. Which was true.\nBut he also liked the peacefulness of it, and the way that not a single cloud\nmarred the sky and he was allowed, for the first time in more than a decade,\njust to lie there and do nothing. Besides, he was cut to pit, and it hurt to\nmove.\n“Ben!” a voice called.\nStyke tried to sit up, but he was tackled back to the ground by Celine,\nwho wrapped her arms around his neck and pinned him, squeezing until her\nface turned red. Styke put one arm around her, squeezing back, before\npicking her up by the back of her trousers and depositing her on his chest.\n“You survived the fight,” he observed.\n“I did!” Celine said. “Sunin let me kill a man.”\nStyke sat up, sending Celine tumbling to the grass. “What?” he asked\nflatly.\nCeline righted herself, then nodded emphatically. “I held the lance and\neverything. I put it through his freckled cheek and watched his brains come\nout the other side. It was gross.”\nStyke got to his feet, ignoring Ibana’s chortle, and searched around for\nSunin. He didn’t have to look far. She was a stone’s throw away, tending to\nher horse. “What the pit, Sunin!” he shouted. “You took her into battle? You\nlet her kill someone?”\n“She has to learn to fight someday,” Sunin said over her shoulder, not\nbothering to turn around.\n“Yeah, when she doesn’t need help holding a lance. Damn it, Sunin, you\nwere supposed to keep her safe.”\n“I had men to kill. Besides, she’s safe, isn’t she?”\nStyke growled, looking at Ibana, who was now bent over, shaking with\nlaughter. Styke lifted a foot and planted it on her shoulder, shoving her\nbackward. She fell into the grass laughing, face red. When he turned back to\nCeline she was staring at him with her chin lifted, like she was expecting\nsomething.\n“You,” he said, pointing a finger at the little girl, “I’m not happy with\nyou. You shouldn’t be killin’ anyone, not at your age.”\n“Yes,” Celine replied haughtily. “Well, I did, and you can’t undo that."

    "text": "you. You shouldn’t be killin’ anyone, not at your age.”\n“Yes,” Celine replied haughtily. “Well, I did, and you can’t undo that.\nI’m a hero now.”\n“By whose standard?”\n“Yours! I killed a man during wartime. You told me that makes you a\nhero. I wanted to be one, and now I am.”\nIbana, now lying with her limbs splayed in a gasping heap, let out a\nbarking laugh. “She’s got you there, Benjamin.”\n“Damn it, I —” Styke cut himself off. He gritted his teeth, wondering\nwhat her dad would have done to punish her for something like this.\nProbably buy her a pint and take her to a drug den, the stupid git. Styke\nleaned over, searching through the grass for one of the tiny red wildflowers\nthat were common this time of year. He plucked it, tying the stem in a knot,\nthen deposited it behind her ear. “All right,” he said quietly. “You’re a hero.\nBut don’t you go into battle again, you promise?”\nCeline stared at her feet glumly.\n“And no taking pointers from that old witch over there. Sunin can’t\neven hold a lance straight anymore. I’ll teach you to fight myself – by the\ntime I’m done with you, you’ll be able to gut someone twice your size\nwithout breaking a sweat.” Celine looked up, beaming, and angled her head\ntoward him to show off the flower. Styke surprised himself by leaning over\nand kissing her on the cheek. “Now go kick Sunin in the shins really hard\nfor me.”\nShe ran off, and Styke glanced at Ibana to find her staring at him, a\nstrange smile on her face. The moment he turned his head it disappeared,\nand she climbed to her feet with all trace of laughter gone. “I suppose this is\ngonna be like it was back during the war, isn’t it? I go do all the work, and\nyou lounge around waiting for the next battle?”\n“That was the plan.”\nIbana rolled her eyes. “What is the next battle?”\n“Not sure,” Styke said, considering. “We’ll stick with Lady Flint. She\nneeds good cavalry, and she pays well.”\n“Rumor has it she tried to arrest Lindet right before the Dynize\nattacked.”\nStyke had heard that rumor as well. It made hitching his horse to her\nwagon a riskier move, and removed the protection she’d originally\npromised against the Blackhats. But it also made him like her twice as\nmuch. “Then she definitely needs more cavalry, and the lancers might get to\nkill some Blackhats after all.” He frowned, recalling the ships still anchored\nout beyond the breakers and the piles of dead being burned all around the\ncity. “The Dynize don’t have just one army,” he said quietly. “I don’t give a\nshit about this godstone thing, but they’ve invaded my country, and that\npisses me off. They’ll be back, and I intend on being there to punch them in\nthe face.”\n“You don’t think Flint’s going to just up and off to the Nine?” Ibana\nasked.\n“I don’t,” Styke said. “Even if she finds an open port at a nearby city"

That obelisk.” He lifted his head, looking east\nto where the godstone still lay where it had fallen during the Dynize attack.\n“Something about it, and the fact that both Lindet and the Dynize want it so\nbadly, sets her off. We’ll stay with her for now.” He was suddenly tired,\nfeeling the weight of a battle on his shoulders, and he gave a brief thought\nfor the dead left behind.\n“Are you Colonel Styke?”\nStyke raised his eyes to find a man on foot, wearing the sharp, clean\nuniform of a Blackhat with a Silver Rose pinned to his chest. He definitely\nwasn’t one of the men who’d gone into battle with them yesterday. Styke\nreached behind him, touching the handle of the knife at his belt. “I am.”\n“Message for you,” the Blackhat said, handing over a sealed note. The\npaper was blank, the wax seal without distinguishing marks. Styke sniffed\nat the paper, smelling the faintest hint of sorcery. He broke the seal with his\nthumb and read the contents.\nBrother, I understand you have survived the battle. I give you my\ncongratulations and my thanks. The nation owes you and the\nRiflejacks a great debt. One which, unfortunately, will never be\npaid. Lady Flint has decided we are enemies, and therefore will\nhave to be removed.\nThe Dynize will not stop – another fleet, as big as the one that\nattacked Landfall, has dropped their soldiers about eighty miles\nsouth of the city. I beg that you abandon Flint and ride to find me in\nRedstone. I have summoned my armies back from the frontier and\ninstituted a conscription. We will crush these Dynize invaders and\ntake back what is ours before something worse can come of this.\nIf you see Fidelis Jes, do not kill him. I have use for you both.\nIt was signed with a simple “S.”\nSister.\nStyke rolled the paper between his thumb and forefinger thoughtfully,\nthen started when it suddenly burst into flames. Within moments the letter\nwas consumed by a sorcerous fire.\n“What just happened?” Ibana asked.\nStyke brushed the ashes off his fingertips and sniffed them. “A ward,”\nhe said. “Likely triggered to burn the message within a few minutes of my\nbreaking the seal.”\n“What did it say?”\nStyke ignored her, looking at a black smudge of ash on his palm. “Will\nyou take a return message?” he asked the Blackhat.\n“Yes, sir. The lady expects it.”\n“Good. Ibana, fetch this nice young man the sack you have tied to your\nsaddle.”\nCHAPTER 66\n“S\no you’re saying this isn’t over?” Michel asked.\nStyke shook his big head and spread his hands. “According to Lindet,\nthere’s a whole other army headed this way. We have less than a week.”\nMichel stood on the plain south of Landfall, just a few hundred yards"

    "text": "there’s a whole other army headed this way. We have less than a week.”\nMichel stood on the plain south of Landfall, just a few hundred yards\nfrom the remains of the land-barge. The big wagon had been struck by\nerrant sorcery during the battle – lightning that almost fried Michel where\nhe stood, and destroyed enough of the big wheels that it wouldn’t be going\nanywhere without being entirely rebuilt.\nHe waited with a group consisting of Styke, Lady Flint, Taniel, and Ka-\npoel and wondered what had gone so terribly wrong in his life to throw him\ninto such company. He shouldn’t be here with warriors, sorcerers, and\nofficers, trying to make decisions that would affect hundreds of thousands\nof people. He should be watching from the shadows, causing the tiny\nripples that kept the government running.\nHe did not, he decided, like the stage, even if it was so far a small one,\nbecause he knew that somewhere was a boardroom filled with the mayor\nand the city elders, waiting for some sort of response from Vlora regarding\nthe battle with the Dynize. Somewhere was the Lady Chancellor, wondering\nwhere her ancient Dynize relic and her Blackhat grand master had gotten to.\n“We can’t defend the city,” Flint said. “Not without heavy\nreinforcements. Fort Nied cannot withstand another shelling, and we’re\ndown well over half of our forces. Did Lindet indicate if she was willing to\ncontribute to the war effort?” She seemed annoyed that it had been Styke,\nand not her, who received a communiqué from Lindet.\nStyke grimaced. “She’s pulling back all the way to Redstone and\ngathering her armies. Sounds like she’s written off Landfall. She’ll let the\nDynize take it, then return with a bigger army – presumably before they\nmanage to use the godstone.”\n“Do they know how to use it?” Michel asked. He didn’t belong here\nwith the others, but the least he could do was add to the conversation.\n“We’re not sure,” Taniel said, his eyes on Ka-poel, who gave an\nexaggerated shrug. “The godstone has been buried beneath the dirt outside\nof Landfall for over a thousand years. The knowledge may be lost, but we\ndon’t know how good the Dynize record-keeping is.”\n“They knew it was here,” Flint pointed out.\n“Because of their own records, or because their spies told them Lindet\nhad unearthed it?” Taniel responded. “We don’t know enough about the\nDynize, but I suspect that’s going to change far quicker than we’d like.”\nFlint seemed distant and withdrawn, and stared across the plain toward\nthe godstone. “They’re coming for that,” she said.\n“I’m tempted to just give it to them.” Styke snorted.\n“Absolutely not,” Flint snapped back. “Not while I’m still breathing.\nThey want a new god, and I’ve seen the damage gods do. I will not allow it\nto fall into their hands.”\nThere was a flurry of gestures from Ka-poel, and Taniel translated.\n“Given enough time, we could reconstruct the land-barge. I imagine\nProfessor Cressel will help us. He’s obsessed with the thing.”\n“To what end?” Flint asked, glancing sidelong at Taniel and Ka-poel."

    "text": "Professor Cressel will help us. He’s obsessed with the thing.”\n“To what end?” Flint asked, glancing sidelong at Taniel and Ka-poel.\n“Where would you take it?”\n“We take it to the Hadshaw River, put it on a couple of barges, and\nbring it north. There’s more than one Palo stronghold we could send it to\nwhere it would be safe, and give us time to study it.”\n“It should not be studied,” Flint insisted.\nKa-poel pursed her lips, tilting her head in a very clear message. Why?\n“Because we’re toying with something we don’t understand. Ka-poel is\npowerful, but that… thing can make gods. I wouldn’t trust myself to toy\nwith it. I certainly don’t trust you.”\nKa-poel glared openly at Flint, who seemed unaffected. Taniel sighed.\n“So what do you suggest? Burying it back in the ground and hoping the\nDynize can’t figure out where it was?”\nMichel couldn’t help himself. He was surrounded by some of the most\nfamous people in the world, and all they could do was bicker. He let out a\nlaugh, and then found everyone staring at him. He cleared his throat. “It’s\nsimple, isn’t it?”\n“What is?” Styke asked.\n“We destroy it. Blow the damn thing to the pit. I read somewhere that\nblack powder is caustic to Privileged, and can even have dampening powers\non sorcery. Just strap it with all the powder barrels you can find and set it\noff.”\nThere was a long, awkward silence. Ka-poel snorted. Taniel sighed\nunhappily, while Styke looked indifferent. Flint gave an emphatic nod. “All\nright,” she said. “We destroy it. If you won’t, then I will. Are you going to\nfight me on this, Taniel?”\nKa-poel launched into a silent tirade, her hands moving quickly, angrily.\nTaniel watched it go on, then finally turned to Flint with a resigned sigh.\n“No, we won’t fight you on it. We’ll help you destroy it.”\nFlint was off a moment later, yelling for powder kegs, while Taniel and\nKa-poel conferred among themselves. Styke seemed untalkative, so Michel\nfound himself alone, wandering off across the cotton fields with no real\ndirection in mind. In the distance, Landfall still smoldered and he wondered\nif the rioting had finally died down. According to Taniel, his Palo had\nflushed out the Dynize agents, then rallied the rioters to put out the flames.\nIt sounded too good to be true, but so did the fact that he was still alive after\nsuch a vicious battle.\nMichel walked toward Landfall slowly, feeling sick to his stomach. So\nmany deaths over such a stupid thing, this godstone. He cheered silently for\nFlint to blow it to the pit, even if it made Taniel and Ka-poel angry. After so\nmany years as their spy, he realized that he no longer knew their goals.\nHe realized that, even worse, he no longer knew his own goals. His\nmission had been accomplished, his cover betrayed.

By all the rules of\nespionage he should disappear – maybe even flee the continent altogether.\nHe wondered if he could use the Platinum Rose to withdraw a king’s\nransom from a bank and vanish before anyone noticed, and if Mother would\nenjoy someplace with a cooler climate. Maybe he’d head in the opposite\ndirection of Taniel and Flint, and go to Adro.\n“Sir,” a voice said, and Michel was startled to find himself no longer\nalone. It was one of the Blackhats, a young woman with a torn jacket, a\nSilver Rose on her breast, and a crutch under one arm. “Agent Hendres\nreporting, sir.”\nMichel blinked back at her for several moments before he remembered\nthat the Platinum Rose was still pinned to his chest. “Right,” he said. “What\ndo you have to report?”\nHendres looked slightly bewildered for a moment, looking first at\nMichel and then toward Landfall. “Sir, I… have nothing to report. But I just\nwanted to know: I overheard Lady Flint talking to one of her men. Has the\nLady Chancellor really abandoned Landfall to the Dynize?”\nMichel sighed, cursing Flint and her military-loud voice. “I hope not,”\nhe replied, hoping it didn’t sound too much like a bald-faced lie.\n“Thing is, sir, you spoke to us yesterday before the fight about our\nfriends and families. There’s not many of us left, but we’d like to head back\nto help them get out of the city.”\n“Then what are you waiting for? Why are you standing here yapping at\nme?”\n“Orders, sir.”\nMichel looked down at the Platinum Rose. He unpinned it, lifted it over\nhis head to throw it into the cotton fields, then thought better of it and\nslipped it into his pocket. “I’m nobody to be giving orders,” he explained.\n“I just said the things I did because they needed to be said.”\nHendres’s face fell, and she nodded slowly, looking down at her boots.\nThe sight of her disappointment made Michel think of all the times his\nmother had given him that same look, not knowing that he – the real him –\nwas working for the very things she valued.\n“If you need orders,” Michel said, removing the Platinum Rose from his\npocket and holding it up, “then you have them. Get the men back in the city.\nTell them to find their families. They can help rebuild if they like, or\nabandon Landfall. I don’t know if the Dynize are planning on burning it\ndown or occupying it, but you’d better make it quick.” He put the Rose\nback in his pocket, then walked over to offer Agent Hendres his arm. She\nleaned against it gratefully, and the two of them began the long walk toward\nLandfall.\nThere was a series of loud shouts, and Michel turned around to look\nback in the direction of the monolith. He realized that he’d wandered quite\nfar away, and squinted to see people running away from the wrecked land-\nbarge.\n“Duck,” he said, helping Hendres into a crouch.\nThe sight of the blast reached them several moments before the sound\nand shock wave did, making his ears ring and nearly knocking him flat on"

A giant ball of flame rose up around the godstone, and he felt a deep\nstab of satisfaction. That, as it went in the storybooks his mother so liked to\nread, was that. He kept his eyes on the smoking ruin in the distance for\nsome time before turning back to Landfall.\n“What are you going to do, sir?” Hendres asked.\nMichel considered this for a moment, then replied, “I’m going to do\nwhat I do best. I’m going to find my mother, be certain she’s safe, and then\nI’m going to make sure that Landfall keeps running in fair weather or foul.”\nEPILOGUE\nT\naniel’s ears rang from the sound of the blast, despite the globs of wax\nhe’d stuffed in them. He watched the fireball from the explosion die\ndown and fought the headache that came along with controlling the\ndetonation of so much powder. He, working in tandem with Vlora, had used\nhis sorcery to warp the entire power of the blast of almost a hundred barrels\nof powder directly toward the center of the monolith.\nIt was enough explosive power to destroy a small city.\n“It didn’t work,” he said, digging the wax out of his ears.\n“Thank you for that observation,” Vlora replied sourly as she and Ka-\npoel did the same. Together, the three of them walked to the monolith,\npicking their way through the charred grasses and the matchsticks that\nremained of the land-barge. The explosion had stained the limestone black,\nquite effectively cleaning the remaining dirt from its cracks and crevices,\nbut appeared to have not so much as scratched the surface.\nKa-poel ran her hand along the ancient runes on the godstone’s side,\nthen shook her head. Nothing.\n“That explosion should have ground this stupid block to dust – or at\nleast cracked it,” Vlora said.\nTaniel walked up and down the length of the godstone twice, reaching\nout gingerly with his senses, wishing that he had Ka-poel’s ability to read\nthe Else. A Privileged would be far more useful here than either him or\nVlora, and Ka-poel was learning about this thing on the fly, so he wasn’t at\nall confident in his own senses.\nBesides, he didn’t like feeling the godstone in the Else. It made the\nbacks of his eyeballs itch and gave him a feeling like spiders crawling up\nhis spine. He’d seen a lot in this world – pit, he’d killed two gods – but this\ngodstone made his skin crawl in a way that facing Kresimir in person had\nnever done.\n“I’m not letting you take it,” Vlora said emphatically.\nTaniel raised his hands in surrender. “You made your position very\nclear. But the Dynize are on their way, and unless you’ve got any better\nideas…” He trailed off, and glanced at Ka-poel, who was now standing\nback, one hand on her chin, mouth pressed into a thoughtful line.\nShe gestured to him. I think I have something.\n“To destroy it?” he asked."

I think I have something.\n“To destroy it?” he asked.\nNo. It might take me a long time to destroy it. But there may be\nsomething else. She explained her plan, and Taniel found himself nodding\nalong.\n“Ka-poel wants to try something,” he said to Vlora. “The wards in the\ngodstone are like nothing any of us has ever seen before. They won’t just\nsuccumb to brute force. All that powder we piled on didn’t even cause a\ndent in them.”\n“So,” Vlora asked suspiciously, “what do you want to try?”\nTaniel was annoyed at her suspicion, but admitted to himself that she\nwas right to be. In a way, he agreed with Lindet. The godstone needed to be\nkept and studied. He just didn’t trust either Lindet or the Dynize to do so.\nAnd unlike Vlora, he did trust his wife to do it.\nKa-poel didn’t answer Vlora. Instead, she searched her satchel for a\nknife, then bent over, cutting a thin furrow in the dirt. She walked\nbackward, working a line into the ground, slowly around the entire\nmonolith. Vlora watched the process with her lips pursed. “Is this\nsomething that’s going to get me killed?” she asked.\n“When Ka-poel works,” Taniel said, hoping his own worry didn’t show\nin his tone, “it’s often something likely to get her killed.” He tilted his head.\nHe thought he had some idea as to what she was up to, but after eleven\nyears as companions she still managed to surprise him more often than not.\nBlood sorcery was far more an art than a science, and it always seemed to\nhis eyes that Ka-poel made up her own rules.\nWhen she’d finished her furrow she stepped back, then back farther,\nthen a little farther, gesturing for Taniel and Vlora to get behind her. Vlora\nsnorted impatiently, but followed her instructions.\n“Give her time,” Taniel asked, retreating to a safe distance.\nKa-poel took a deep breath, squaring her shoulders and holding her\nhands with palms pointed downward. There she remained as the seconds,\nthen minutes, ticked by.\n“What’s she doing?” Vlora finally whispered.\nTaniel responded honestly, “I have no idea.”\nIt was some time before he got the strange impression that the ground\nwas moving. He ignored it at first, and then realized it wasn’t the ground at\nall. Something was creeping over the soil through the stalks of the cotton\nplants. He looked down at his feet and all the hair on the back of his neck\nstood on end.\nThe ground was covered in blood. Not soaked with it, but literally\ncovered, like red ink spilled on an impermeable surface. It flowed, black\nand thick, bringing the smell of rotten corpses with it, toward the godstone.\nVlora didn’t seem to notice until the blood reached the stone and began to\nclimb up it, and then she let out a gasp.\nThe blood continued to come. There were ample amounts, after all.\nThousands of gallons soaked into the dirt, and it all moved along at her\nwhim."

There were ample amounts, after all.\nThousands of gallons soaked into the dirt, and it all moved along at her\nwhim.\n“Is this something she does often?” Vlora asked, obviously unnerved.\n“I’ve never seen this before.”\nThe blood worked its way up and around until it completely covered the\nmonolith in a thick black sludge, and then it disappeared slowly, like water\ngoing down a drain. It took Taniel a moment to realize the blood had soaked\ninto the godstone.\n“That,” Vlora said, awe in her voice, “is one of the most terrifying\nthings I’ve ever seen.”\nTaniel eyed the side of his wife’s face, wondering what was going\nthrough her mind. Even on the best of days, she could still be inscrutable.\nShe was a mystery, through and through, and sometimes it scared him. But\nthen again, that mystery was why he loved her as much as he did.\nKa-poel suddenly let out a sigh and sagged, and Taniel rushed forward\nto catch her before she fell. She felt so small in his arms; weak. He\nremembered that someone had once described her as a teapot full of\ngunpowder – powerful but fragile – and he thought the description as apt as\never. “You’ll need to rest tomorrow,” he told her.\nShe nodded in agreement.\n“What has she done?” Vlora asked, walking up to the monolith and\nplacing her hand hesitantly on the side.\nTaniel reached out with his own senses. He could no longer feel the\nsorcery of the monolith, or the dark whispering in the back of his mind. It\nwas, it seemed, nothing more than stone. Ka-poel spoke with her hands, and\nhe translated: “She’s sealed it. The sorcery is still there, buried inside, but\nshe used the…” He frowned, watching as she repeated her hand motions,\nthen he continued. “She’s used the blood of the fallen to create a barrier.\nShe says the Dynize bone-eyes probably will be able to pick it apart,\neventually.” He laughed at the final two gestures, her bold confidence\namusing him. “But,” he said, “she’s far more powerful than any of them.\nIt’ll take them forever to access the stone.”\n“So we have time,” Vlora said flatly.\n“That’s all we can offer,” Taniel responded.\nVlora paced back and forth, and Taniel hoped she understood. Ka-poel\nwas dangerous, but she was not infallible or omnipotent. If she said\nbreaking the godstone was beyond her ability, he believed her. “How long?”\nVlora asked.\nKa-poel shrugged, and Taniel said, “Months? Years? Who knows? It\ndepends on how clever Ka-sedial is.”\nVlora was clearly unhappy with the answer, but she walked across the\nfield to a number of her aides standing farther back. She returned a moment\nlater, a scowl on her face. “It’s done,” she said.\n“What?” Taniel asked.\n“I’ve ordered the evacuation of the city.”\n“Ah.”\nVlora suddenly closed her eyes, and Taniel wondered if he spotted tears"

They’d have a tool to make a monster.”\n“They’ll still get it,” Vlora said. “We’re leaving the city. Withdrawing. I\ncan’t defend it without Lindet’s help, and she now wants my head. The\nDynize will take Landfall and the godstone.”\n“We’ll be back,” Taniel said confidently. He nodded to himself, hoping\nhe was right. The fate of the entire continent rested on the idea. “It’ll take\nsome time, but I’ll give you an army of Palo that can match the Dynize.”\n“And what about Lindet?” Vlora asked.\n“We’ll have to deal with her when it comes to that. In the meantime, we\nneed to worry about the other two godstones.”\nVlora inhaled sharply. “Excuse me?”\nTaniel felt tired – more tired than he’d felt at any time since his father\ndied. But he also felt good. This was the first step in a plan he and Ka-poel\nhad been working on for the better part of a decade. He glanced around,\nnoticing that some of the Riflejacks were staring at him and Ka-poel. They\nwere beginning to suspect who he was, and he didn’t much care. In fact,\nthere was a freedom in being alive to the world again. “Two more\ngodstones,” he said, holding up his fingers. “Don’t worry. I’m sure Lindet is\nalready well on her way to finding them. We just have to make sure we get\nto them before she does.”\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI can never say enough about my awesome editor, Devi Pillai, and the\nguidance she gives to my books. She was especially patient with this one,\nand it’s ten times better than it would have been without her ability to make\nme do my best. The usual thanks go out to my agent, Caitlin Blasdell, who\nruns interference for me when I’m behind schedule, and gives me pep talks\nwhen I need them.\nThanks to my wife, Michele, for reading the drafts of this book into the\nearly hours of the morning to help me get it done.

A good beta-reader is often an\nunsung hero of the editing process, and mine are no exception.\nThe biggest appreciation goes out to all the people at Orbit who take\nthese stories from my head and put them on the shelf, including (but not\nlimited to) Lauren Panepinto, James Long, Alex Lencicki, Ellen Wright,\nand Laura Fitzgerald.

Not only that, but there’s a young, beautiful and skilled\ngeneral out there, gathering soldiers to her banner for a war against the\ndeadliest of enemies. The girl is using a legend she did not earn, and\ncalling herself by a name that was never hers – that of Zosia herself.\nChapter\n1\nIt was all going so nicely, right up until the massacre.\nSir Hjortt’s cavalry of two hundred spears fanned out through the small\nvillage, taking up positions between half-timbered houses in the uneven\nlanes that only the most charitable of surveyors would refer to as ‘roads.’\nThe warhorses slowed and then stopped in a decent approximation of\nunison, their riders sitting as stiff and straight in their saddles as the lances\nthey braced against their stirrups. It was an unseasonably warm afternoon in\nthe autumn, and after their long approach up the steep valley, soldier and\nsteed alike dripped sweat, yet not a one of them removed their brass\nskullcap.

To their colonel, Sir Hjortt, they looked like hired killers\non horseback barely possessed of sense to do as they were told most of the\ntime. Had the knight been able to train wardogs to ride he should have\npreferred them to the Fifteenth Cavalry, given the amount of faith he placed\nin this lot. Not much, in other words, not very much at all.\nHe didn’t care for dogs, either, but a dog you could trust, even if it was\nonly to lick his balls."

    "text": "in this lot. Not much, in other words, not very much at all.\nHe didn’t care for dogs, either, but a dog you could trust, even if it was\nonly to lick his balls.\nThe hamlet sprawled across the last stretch of grassy meadow before the\ncollision of two steep, bald-peaked mountains. Murky forest edged in on all\nsides, like a snare the wilderness had set for the unwary traveler. A typical\nmountain town here in the Kutumban range, then, with only a low\nreinforced stone wall to keep out the wolves and what piddling avalanches\nthe encircling slopes must bowl down at the settlement when the snows\nmelted.\nSir Hjortt had led his troops straight through the open gate in the wall\nand up the main track to the largest house in the village… which wasn’t\nsaying a whole lot for the building. Fenced in by shedding rosebushes and\nstanding a scant two and a half stories tall, its windowless redbrick face was\nbroken into a grid by the black timbers that supported it. The mossy\nthatched roof rose up into a witch’s hat, and set squarely in the center like a\nmouth were a great pair of doors tall and wide enough for two riders to pass\nthrough abreast without removing their helmets. As he reached the break in\nthe hedge at the front of the house, Sir Hjortt saw that one of these oaken\ndoors was ajar, but just as he noticed this detail the door eased shut.\nSir Hjortt smiled to himself, and, reining his horse in front of the\nrosebushes, called out in his deepest baritone, ‘I am Sir Efrain Hjortt of\nAzgaroth, Fifteenth Colonel of the Crimson Empire, come to counsel with\nthe mayor’s wife. I have met your lord mayor upon the road, and while he\nreposes at my camp —’\nSomeone behind him snickered at that, but when Sir Hjortt turned in his\nsaddle he could not locate which of his troops was the culprit. It might have\neven come from one of his two personal Chainite guards, who had stopped\ntheir horses at the border of the thorny hedge. He gave both his guards and\nthe riders nearest them the sort of withering scowl his father was overly\nfond of doling out. This was no laughing matter, as should have been\nperfectly obvious from the way Sir Hjortt had dealt with the hillbilly mayor\nof this shitburg.\n‘Ahem.’ Sir Hjortt turned back to the building and tried again. ‘Whilst\nyour lord mayor reposes at my camp, I bring tidings of great import. I must\nspeak with the mayor’s wife at once.’\nAnything? Nothing. The whole town was silently, fearfully watching\nhim from hiding, he could feel it in his aching thighs, but not a one braved\nthe daylight either to confront or assist him. Peasants – what a sorry lot they\nwere.\n‘I say again!’ Sir Hjortt called, goading his stallion into the mayor’s\nyard and advancing on the double doors. ‘As a colonel of the Crimson\nEmpire and a knight of Azgaroth, I shall be welcomed by the family of your\nmayor, or —’"

He heard muted bells, obviously to\nsignal that the ambush was under way, and the hungry grunting of the pack,\nand —\nThe cattle milled about him, snuffling his horse with their broad, slimy\nnoses, but now that they had escaped the confines of the building they\nbetrayed no intention toward further excitement.\n‘Very sorry, sir,’ came a hillfolk-accented voice from somewhere\nnearby, and then a small, pale hand appeared amid the cattle, rising from\nbetween the bovine waves like the last, desperate attempt of a drowning\nman to catch a piece of driftwood. Then the hand seized a black coat and a\nblond boy of perhaps ten or twelve vaulted himself nimbly into sight,\nlanding on the wide back of a mountain cow and twisting the creature\naround to face Sir Hjortt as effortlessly as the Azgarothian controlled his\nwarhorse. Despite this manifest skill and agility at play before him, the\nknight remained unimpressed.\n‘The mayor’s wife,’ said Sir Hjortt. ‘I am to meet with her. Now. Is she\nin?’\n‘I expect so,’ said the boy, glancing over his shoulder – checking the\nposition of the sun against the lee of the mountains towering over the\nvillage, no doubt. ‘Sorry again ’bout my cows. They’re feisty, sir; had to\nbring ’em down early on account of a horned wolf being seen a few vales\nover. And I, uh, didn’t have the barn door locked as I should have.’\n‘Spying on us, eh?’ said Sir Hjortt. The boy grinned. ‘Perhaps I’ll let it\nslide this once, if you go and fetch your mistress from inside.’\n‘Mayoress is probably up in her house, sir, but I’m not allowed ’round\nthere anymore, on account of my wretched behavior,’ said the boy with\nobvious pride.\n‘This isn’t her home?’ Hjortt eyed the building warily.\n‘No, sir. This is the barn.’\nAnother chuckle from one of his faithless troops, but Sir Hjortt didn’t\ngive whoever it was the satisfaction of turning in his saddle a second time.\nHe’d find the culprit after the day’s business was done, and then they’d see\nwhat came of having a laugh at their commander’s expense. Like the rest of\nthe Fifteenth Regiment, the cavalry apparently thought their new colonel\nwas green because he wasn’t yet twenty, but he would soon show them that\nbeing young and being green weren’t the same thing at all.\nNow that their cowherd champion had engaged the invaders, gaily\npainted doors began to open and the braver citizenry slunk out onto their\nstoops, clearly awestruck at the Imperial soldiers in their midst.

Sir Hjortt\ngrunted in satisfaction – it had been so quiet in the hamlet that he had begun\nto wonder if the villagers had somehow been tipped off to his approach and\nscampered away into the mountains.\n‘Where’s the mayor’s house, then?’ he said, reins squeaking in his\ngauntlets as he glared at the boy.\n‘See the trail there?’ said the boy, pointing to the east. Following the\nlad’s finger down a lane beside a longhouse, Sir Hjortt saw a small gate set\nin the village wall, and beyond that a faint trail leading up the grassy foot of\nthe steepest peak in the valley.\n‘My glass, Portolés,’ said Sir Hjortt, and his bodyguard walked her\nhorse over beside his. Sir Hjortt knew that if he carried the priceless item in\nhis own saddlebag one of his thuggish soldiers would likely find a way of\nstealing it, but not a one of them would dare try that shit with the burly war\nnun. She handed it over and Sir Hjortt withdrew the heavy brass hawkglass\nfrom its sheath; it was the only gift his father had ever given him that\nwasn’t a weapon of some sort, and he relished any excuse to use it. Finding\nthe magnified trail through the instrument, he tracked it up the meadow to\nwhere the path entered the surrounding forest. A copse of yellowing aspen\ninterrupted the pines and fir, and, scanning the hawkglass upward, he saw\nthat this vein of gold continued up the otherwise evergreen-covered\nmountain.\n‘See it?’ the cowherd said. ‘They live back up in there. Not far.’\nSir Hjortt gained a false summit and leaned against one of the trees. The\nthin trunk bowed under his weight, its copper leaves hissing at his touch, its\nwhite bark leaving dust on his cape. The series of switchbacks carved into\nthe increasingly sheer mountainside had become too treacherous for the\nhorses, and so Sir Hjortt and his two guards, Brother Iqbal and Sister\nPortolés, had proceeded up the scarps of exposed granite on foot. The\npossibility of a trap had not left the knight, but nothing more hostile than a\nhummingbird had showed itself on the hike, and now that his eyes had\nadjusted to the strangely diffuse light of this latest grove, he saw a modest,\nfreshly whitewashed house perched on the lip of the next rock shelf.\nSeveral hundred feet above them. Brother Iqbal laughed and Sister\nPortolés cursed, yet her outburst carried more humor in it than his. Through\nthe trees they went, and then made the final ascent.\n‘Why…’ puffed Iqbal, the repurposed grain satchel slung over one\nmeaty shoulder retarding his already sluggish pace, ‘in all the… devils of\nEmeritus… would a mayor… live… so far… from his town?’\n‘I can think of a reason or three,’ said Portolés, setting the head of her\nweighty maul in the path and resting against its long shaft. ‘Take a look\nbehind us.’\nSir Hjortt paused, amenable to a break himself – even with only his"

Turning,\nhe let out an appreciative whistle. They had climbed quickly, and spread out\nbelow them was the painting-perfect hamlet nestled at the base of the\nmountains. Beyond the thin line of its walls, the lush valley fell away into\nthe distance, a meandering brook dividing east ridge from west. Sir Hjortt\nwas hardly a single-minded, bloodthirsty brute, and he could certainly\nappreciate the allure of living high above one’s vassals, surrounded by the\nbreathtaking beauty of creation. Perhaps when this unfortunate errand was\nover he would convert the mayor’s house into a hunting lodge, wiling away\nhis summers with sport and relaxation in the clean highland air.\n‘Best vantage in the valley,’ said Portolés. ‘Gives the headperson plenty\nof time to decide how to greet any guests.’\n‘Do you think she’s put on a kettle for us?’ said Iqbal hopefully. ‘I could\ndo with a spot of hunter’s tea.’\n‘About this mission, Colonel…’ Portolés was looking at Sir Hjortt but\nnot meeting his eyes. She’d been poorly covering up her discomfort with\nphony bravado ever since he’d informed her what needed to be done here,\nand the knight could well imagine what would come next. ‘I wonder if the\norder —’\n‘And I wonder if your church superiors gave me the use of you two\nanathemas so that you might hem and haw and question me at every pass,\ninstead of respecting my command as an Imperial colonel,’ said Sir Hjortt,\nwhich brought bruise-hued blushes to the big woman’s cheeks. ‘Azgaroth\nhas been a proud and faithful servant of the Kings and Queens of Samoth\nfor near on a century, whereas your popes seem to revolt every other feast\nday, so remind me again, what use have I for your counsel?’\nPortolés muttered an apology, and Iqbal fidgeted with the damp sack he\ncarried.\n‘Do you think I relish what we have to do? Do you think I would put\nmy soldiers through it, if I had a choice? Why would I give such a\ncommand, if it was at all avoidable? Why —’ Sir Hjortt was just warming\nto his lecture when a fissure of pain opened up his skull. Intense and\nunpleasant as the sensation was, it fled in moments, leaving him to\nnervously consider the witchborn pair. Had one of them somehow brought\non the headache with their devilish ways? Probably not; he’d had a touch of\na headache for much of the ride up, come to think of it, and he hadn’t even\nmentioned the plan to them then.\n‘Come on,’ he said, deciding it would be best to drop the matter without\nfurther pontification. Even if his bodyguards did have reservations, this\nmission would prove an object lesson that it is always better to rush through\nany necessary unpleasantness, rather than drag your feet and overanalyze\nevery ugly detail. ‘Let’s be done with this.

I want to be down the valley by\ndark, bad as that road is.’\nThey edged around a hairpin bend in the steep trail, and then the track’s\ncrudely hewn stair delivered them to another plateau, and the mayor’s\nhouse. It was similar in design to those in the hamlet, but with a porch\noverhanging the edge of the mild cliff and a low white fence. Pleasant\nenough, thought Sir Hjortt, except that the fence was made of bone, with\neach outwardly bowed moose-rib picket topped with the skull of a different\nanimal. Owlbat skulls sat between those of marmot and hill fox, and above\nthe door of the cabin rested an enormous one that had to be a horned wolf;\nwhen the cowherd had mentioned such a beast being spied in the area, Sir\nHjortt had assumed the boy full of what his cows deposited, but maybe a\nfew still prowled these lonely mountains. What a thrill it would be, to\nmount a hunting party for such rare game! Then the door beneath the skull\ncreaked, and a figure stood framed in the doorway.\n‘Well met, friends, you’ve come a long way,’ the woman greeted them.\nShe was brawny, though not so big as Portolés, with features as hard as the\ntrek up to her house. She might have been fit enough once, in a country sort\nof way, when her long, silvery hair was blond or black or red and tied back\nin pigtails the way Hjortt liked… but now she was just an old woman, same\nas any other, fifty winters young at a minimum. Judging from the tangled\nbone fetishes hanging from the limbs of the sole tree that grew inside the\nfence’s perimeter – a tall, black-barked aspen with leaves as hoary as her\nlocks – she might be a sorceress, to boot.\nIqbal returned her welcome, calling, ‘Well met, Mum, well met indeed.\nI present to you Sir Hjortt of Azgaroth, Fifteenth Colonel of the Crimson\nEmpire.’ The anathema glanced to his superior, but when Sir Hjortt didn’t\nfall all over himself to charge ahead and meet a potential witch, Iqbal\nmurmured, ‘She’s just an old bird, sir, nothing to fret about.’\n‘Old bird or fledgling, I wouldn’t blindly stick my hand in an owlbat’s\nnest,’ Portolés said, stepping past Sir Hjortt and Iqbal to address the old\nwoman in the Crimson tongue. ‘In the names of the Pontiff of the West and\nthe Queen of the Rest, I order you out here into the light, woman.’\n‘Queen of the Rest?’ The woman obliged Portolés, stepping down the\ncreaking steps of her porch and approaching the fence. For a mayor’s wife,\nher checked dirndl was as plain as any village girl’s. ‘And Pontiff of the\nWest, is it?

Is this\nsovereign of the Rest, blessed whoever she be, still Queen Indsorith? And\ndoes this mean peace has once again been brokered?’\n‘This bird hears a lot from her tree,’ muttered Sir Hjortt, then asked the\nwoman, ‘Are you indeed the mayor’s wife?’\n‘I am Mayoress Vivi, wife of Leib,’ said she. ‘And I ask again,\nrespectfully, to whom shall I direct my prayers when next I —’\n‘The righteous reign of Queen Indsorith continues, blessed be her\nname,’ said Sir Hjortt. ‘Pope Shanatu, blessed be his name, received word\nfrom on high that his time as Shepherd of Samoth has come to an end, and\nso the war is over. His niece Jirella, blessed be her name, has ascended to\nher rightful place behind the Onyx Pulpit, and taken on the title of Pope\nY’Homa III, Mother of Midnight, Shepherdess of the Lost.’\n‘I see,’ said the mayoress. ‘And in addition to accepting a rebel pope’s\nresignation and the promotion of his kin to the same lofty post, our beloved\nIndsorith, long may her glory persist, has also swapped out her noble title?\n“Queen of Samoth, Heart of the Star, Jewel of Diadem, Keeper of the\nCrimson Empire” for, ah, “Queen of the Rest”?’ The woman’s faintly lined\nface wrinkled further as she smiled, and Portolés slyly returned it.\n‘Do not mistake my subordinate’s peculiar sense of humor for a shift in\npolicy – the queen’s honorifics remain unchanged,’ said Sir Hjortt, thinking\nof how best to discipline Portolés. If she thought that sort of thing flew with\nher commanding colonel just because there were no higher-ranked clerical\nwitnesses to her dishonorable talk, the witchborn freak had another thing\ncoming. He almost wished she would refuse to carry out his command, so\nhe’d have an excuse to get rid of her altogether. In High Azgarothian, he\nsaid, ‘Portolés, return to the village and give the order. In the time it will\ntake you to make it down I’ll have made myself clear enough.’\nPortolés stiffened and gave Sir Hjortt a pathetic frown that told him\nshe’d been holding out hope that he would change his mind. Not bloody\nlikely. Also in Azgarothian, the war nun said, ‘I’m… I’m just going to have\na look inside before I do. Make sure it’s safe, Colonel Hjortt.’\n‘By all means, Sister Portolés, welcome, welcome,’ said the older\nwoman, also in that ancient and honorable tongue of Sir Hjortt’s ancestors.\nUnexpected, that, but then the Star had been a different place when this\nbiddy was in her prime, and perhaps she had seen more of it than just her\nremote mountain.

Good. ‘I have an old hound sleeping in the kitchen\nwhom I should prefer you left to his dreams, but am otherwise alone. But,\ngood Colonel, Leib was to have been at the crossroads this morning…’\nSir Hjortt ignored the mayor’s wife, following Portolés through the gate\nonto the walkway of flat, colorful stones that crossed the yard. They were\nartlessly arranged; the first order of business would be to hire the mason\nwho had done the bathrooms at his family estate in Cockspar, or maybe the\nwoman’s apprentice, if the hoity-toity artisan wasn’t willing to journey a\nhundred leagues into the wilds to retile a walk. A mosaic of miniature\nanimals would be nice, or maybe indigo shingles could be used to make it\nresemble a creek. But then they had forded a rill on their way up from the\nvillage, so why not have somebody trace it to its source and divert it this\nway, have an actual stream flow through the yard? It couldn’t be that hard\nto have it come down through the trees there and then run over the cliff\nbeside the deck, creating a miniature waterfall that —\n‘Empty,’ said Portolés, coming back outside. Sir Hjortt had lost track of\nhimself – it had been a steep march up, and a long ride before that. Portolés\nsilently moved behind the older woman, who stood on the walk between Sir\nHjortt and her house. The matron looked nervous now, all right.\n‘My husband Leib, Colonel Hjortt. Did you meet him at the\ncrossroads?’ Her voice was weaker now, barely louder than the quaking\naspens. That must be something to hear as one lay in bed after a hard day’s\nhunt, the rustling of those golden leaves just outside your window.\n‘New plan,’ said Sir Hjortt, not bothering with the more formal\nAzgarothian, since she spoke it anyway. ‘Well, it’s the same as the original,\nmostly, but instead of riding down before dark we’ll bivouac here for the\nnight.’ Smiling at the old woman, he said, ‘Do not fret, Missus Mayor, do\nnot fret, I won’t be garrisoning my soldiers in your town, I assure you.\nCamp them outside the wall, when they’re done. We’ll ride out at first’ – the\nthought of sleeping in on a proper bed occurred to him – ‘noon. We ride at\nnoon tomorrow. Report back to me when it’s done.’\n‘Whatever you’re planning, sir, let us parley before you commit\nyourself,’ said the old woman, seeming to awaken from the anxious spell\ntheir presence had cast upon her. She had a stern bearing he wasn’t at all\nsure he liked. ‘Your officer can surely tarry a few minutes before delivering\nyour orders, especially if we are to have you as our guests for the night. Let\nus speak, you and I, and no matter what orders you may have, no matter\nhow pressing your need, I shall make it worth your while to have listened.’\nPortolés’s puppy-dog eyes from over the woman’s shoulder turned Sir"

At least Iqbal had the decency to keep his smug gaze on\nthe old woman.\n‘Whether or not she is capable of doing so, Sister Portolés will not\nwait,’ said Sir Hjortt shortly. ‘You and I are talking, and directly, make no\nmistake, but I see no reason to delay my subordinate.’\nThe old woman looked back past Portolés, frowning at the open door of\nher cabin, and then shrugged. As if she had any say at all in how this would\ntranspire. Flashing a patently false smile at Sir Hjortt, she said, ‘As you\nwill, fine sir. I merely thought you might have use for the sister as we\nspoke, for we may be talking for some time.’\nFallen Mother have mercy, did every single person have a better idea of\nhow Sir Hjortt should conduct himself than he did? This would not stand.\n‘My good woman,’ he said, ‘it seems that we have even more to parley\nthan I previously suspected. Sister Portolés’s business is pressing, however,\nand so she must away before we embark on this long conversation you so\ndesire. Fear not, however, for the terms of supplication your husband laid\nout to us at the crossroads shall be honored, reasonable as they undeniably\nare. Off with you, Portolés.’\nPortolés offered him one of her sardonic salutes from over the older\nwoman’s shoulder, and then stalked out of the yard, looking as petulant as\nhe’d ever seen her. Iqbal whispered something to her as he moved out of her\nway by the gate, and wasn’t fast enough in his retreat when she lashed out\nat him. The war nun flicked the malformed ear that emerged from Iqbal’s\npale tonsure like the outermost leaf of an overripe cabbage, rage rendering\nher face even less appealing, if such a thing was possible. Iqbal swung his\nheavy satchel at her in response, and although Portolés dodged the blow, the\ndark bottom of the sackcloth misted her with red droplets as it whizzed past\nher face. If the sister noticed the blood on her face, she didn’t seem to care,\ndragging her feet down the precarious trail, her maul slung over one\nhunched shoulder.\n‘My husband,’ the matron whispered, and, turning back to her, Sir Hjortt\nsaw that her wide eyes were fixed on Iqbal’s dripping sack.\n‘Best if we talk inside,’ said Sir Hjortt, winking at Iqbal and ushering\nthe woman toward her door. ‘Come, come, I have an absolutely brilliant\nidea about how you and your people might help with the war effort, and I’d\nrather discuss it over tea.’\n‘You said the war was over,’ the woman said numbly, still staring at the\nsatchel.\n‘So it is, so it is,’ said Sir Hjortt. ‘But the effort needs to be made to\nensure it doesn’t start up again, what? Now, what do you have to slake the\nthirst of servants of the Empire, home from the front?’"
