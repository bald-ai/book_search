The house was a two-story, three-bedroom affair sitting by\nitself in the woods at the end of a dirt path. It was a twenty-minute walk\ninto town from here. Unlikely anyone would hear gunshots.\nOr screams.\nFour of Lord Vetas’s men milled about in the dining room, drinking and\nplaying cards. Two of them were large and well-muscled as draft horses. A\nthird was of middling height, with a heavy gut hanging out of his shirt and a\nthick black beard.\nThe final man was the only one Adamat recognized. He had a square\nface and a head that was almost comically small. His name was Roja the\nFox, and he was the smallest boxer in the bareknuckle-boxing circuit run by\nthe Proprietor back in Adopest. He could move faster than most boxers, by\nnecessity, but he wasn’t popular with the crowds and did not fight often.\nWhat he was doing here, Adamat had no idea.\nWhat he did know was that he feared for the safety of his children—\nespecially his daughters—with a group of malcontents like this.\n“Sergeant,” Adamat whispered.\nThe hedgerow rustled, and Adamat caught a glimpse of Sergeant\nOldrich’s face. He had a sharp jawline, and the dim moonlight betrayed the\nbulge of tobacco in one cheek. “My men are in place,” Oldrich responded.\n“Are they all in the dining room?”\n“Yes.” Adamat had observed the house for three days now. All that time\nhe’d stood by and watched these men yell at his children and smoke cigars\nin his house, dropping ash and spilling beer on Faye’s good tablecloth. He\nknew their habits.\nHe knew that the fat, bearded one stayed upstairs, keeping an eye on the\nchildren all day. He knew the two big thugs escorted the children to the\nouthouse while Roja the Fox kept watch. He knew the four of them\nwouldn’t leave the children by themselves until after dark, when they’d set\nup their nightly card game on the dining room table.\nHe also knew that in three days, he’d seen no sign of his wife or his\noldest son.\nSergeant Oldrich pressed a loaded pistol into Adamat’s hand. “Are you\nsure you want to lead on this? My men are good. They’ll get the children\nout unharmed.”\n“I’m sure,” Adamat said. “They’re my family. My responsibility.”\n“Don’t hesitate to pull the trigger if they head toward the stairs,” Oldrich"

        "text": "out unharmed.”\n“I’m sure,” Adamat said. “They’re my family. My responsibility.”\n“Don’t hesitate to pull the trigger if they head toward the stairs,” Oldrich\nsaid. “We don’t want them to take hostages.”\nThe children were already hostages, Adamat wanted to say. He bit back\nhis words and smoothed the front of his shirt with one hand. The sky was\ncloudy, and now that the sun had set there would be no light to betray his\npresence to those inside. He stepped out of the hedgerow and was suddenly\nreminded of the night he’d been summoned to Skyline Palace. That was the\nnight all this had begun: the coup, then the traitor, then Lord Vetas. Silently,\nhe cursed Field Marshal Tamas for drawing him and his family into this.\nSergeant Oldrich’s soldiers crept out across the worn dirt path with\nAdamat, heading toward the front of the house. Adamat knew there were\nanother eight behind the house. Sixteen men in total. They had the numbers.\nThey had the element of surprise.\nLord Vetas’s goons had Adamat’s children.\nAdamat paused at the front door. Adran soldiers, their dark-blue\nuniforms almost impossible to see in the darkness, took up spots beneath\nthe dining room windows, their muskets at the ready. Adamat looked down\nat the door. Faye had chosen this house, instead of one closer to town, in\npart because of the door. It was a sturdy oak door with iron hinges. She felt\nthat a strong door made her family safer.\nHe’d never had the heart to tell her the door frame was riddled with\ntermites. In fact, Adamat had always meant to have it replaced.\nAdamat stepped back and kicked right next to the doorknob.\nThe rotten wood exploded with the impact. Adamat ducked into the\nfront hall and brought his pistol up as he rounded the corner.\nAll four of the goons burst into action. One of the big men leapt toward\nthe back doorway leading to the staircase. Adamat held his pistol steady and\nfired and the man dropped.\n“Don’t move,” Adamat said. “You’re surrounded!”\nThe remaining three goons stared back at him, frozen in place. He saw\ntheir eyes go to his spent pistol, and then they all went for him at once.\nThe volley of musket balls from the soldiers outside burst the window\nand glass showered the room like frost. The remaining goons went down,\nexcept for Roja the Fox. He stumbled toward Adamat with a knife drawn,\nblood soaking the sleeve of one arm.\nAdamat reversed the grip on his pistol and brought the butt down on\nRoja’s head.\nJust like that, it was over.\nSoldiers spilled into the dining room. Adamat pushed past them and\nbolted up the stairs. He checked the children’s rooms first: all empty.\nFinally, the master bedroom. He flung the door open with such force it\nnearly flew off the hinges.\nThe children were huddled together in the narrow space between the bed\nand the wall. The older siblings embraced the younger ones, shielding them\nin their arms as best they could. Seven frightened faces stared up at\nAdamat. One of the twins was crying, no doubt from the crack of the\nmuskets. Silent tears streamed down his chubby cheeks. The other poked"

        "text": "in their arms as best they could. Seven frightened faces stared up at\nAdamat. One of the twins was crying, no doubt from the crack of the\nmuskets. Silent tears streamed down his chubby cheeks. The other poked\nhis head out timidly from his hiding place beneath the bed.\nAdamat breathed a sigh of relief and fell to his knees. They were alive.\nHis children. He felt the tears come unbidden as he was mobbed by small\nbodies. Tiny hands reached out and touched his face. He threw his arms\nwide, grabbing as many of them as possible and pulling them closer.\nAdamat wiped the tears from his cheeks. It wasn’t seemly to cry in front\nof the children. He took a great breath to compose himself and said, “I’m\nhere. You’re safe. I’ve come with Field Marshal Tamas’s men.”\nAnother round of happy sobs and hugs followed before Adamat was\nable to restore order.\n“Where is your mother? Where’s Josep?”\nFanish, his second oldest, helped to shush the other children. “They took\nAstrit a few weeks ago,” she said, pulling at her long black braid with\nshaking fingers. “Just last week they came and took Mama and Josep.”\n“Astrit is safe,” Adamat said. “Don’t worry. Did they say where they\nwere taking Mama and Josep?”\nFanish shook her head.\nAdamat felt his heart fall, but he didn’t let it show on his face. “Did they\nhurt you? Any of you?” He was most concerned for Fanish. She was\nfourteen, practically a woman. Her shoulders were bare beneath her thin\nnightgown. Adamat searched for bruises and breathed a word of thanks\nthere were none.\n“No, Papa,” Fanish said. “I heard the men talking. They wanted to,\nbut…”\n“But what?”\n“A man came when they took away Mama and Josep. I didn’t hear his\nname, but he was dressed as a gentleman and he spoke very quietly. He told\nthem that if they touched us before he gave them permission, he’d…” She\ntrailed off and her face went pale.\nAdamat patted her on the cheek. “You’ve been very brave,” he reassured\nher gently. Inside, Adamat fumed. Once Adamat was no longer any use to\nhim, Vetas no doubt would have turned those goons loose on the children\nwithout a second thought.\n“I’m going to find them,” he said. He patted Fanish on the cheek again\nand stood up. One of the twins grabbed his hand.\n“Don’t go,” he begged.\nAdamat wiped the little one’s tears. “I’ll be right back. Stay with\nFanish.” Adamat wrenched himself away. There was still one more child\nand his wife to save—more battles to win before they were all safely\nreunited.\nHe found Sergeant Oldrich just outside the upstairs bedroom, waiting\nrespectfully with his hat in his hands.\n“They took Faye and my oldest son,” Adamat said. “The rest of the\nchildren are safe. Are any of those animals alive?”\nOldrich kept his voice low so the children wouldn’t overhear. “One of\nthem took a bullet to the eye. Another, the heart. It was a lucky volley.” He"

        "text": "Oldrich kept his voice low so the children wouldn’t overhear. “One of\nthem took a bullet to the eye. Another, the heart. It was a lucky volley.” He\nscratched the back of his head. Oldrich wasn’t old by any means, but his\nhair was already graying just above his ears. His cheeks were flushed from\nthe storm of violence. His voice, though, was even.\n“Too lucky,” Adamat said. “I needed one of them alive.”\n“One’s alive,” Oldrich said.\nWhen Adamat reached the kitchen, he found Roja sitting in one of the\nchairs, his hands tied behind his back, bleeding from bullet wounds to the\nshoulder and hip.\nAdamat retrieved a cane from the umbrella stand beside the front door.\nRoja stared balefully at the floor. He was a boxer, a fighter. He wouldn’t go\ndown easy.\n“You’re lucky, Roja,” Adamat said, pointing to the bullet wounds with\nthe tip of his cane. “You might survive these. If you receive medical\nattention quickly enough.”\n“I know you?” Roja said, snorting. Blood speckled his dirty linen shirt.\n“No, you don’t. But I know you. I’ve watched you fight. Where’s\nVetas?”\nRoja turned his neck to the side and popped it. His eyes held a challenge.\n“Vetas? Don’t know him.”\nBeneath the feigned ignorance, Adamat thought he caught a note of\nrecognition in the boxer’s voice.\nAdamat placed the tip of his cane against Roja’s shoulder, right next to\nthe bullet wound. “Your employer.”\n“Eat shit,” Roja said.\nAdamat pressed on his cane. He could feel the ball still in there, up\nagainst the bone. Roja squirmed. To his credit, he didn’t make a sound. A\nbareknuckle boxer, if he was any good, learned to embrace pain.\n“Where’s Vetas?”\nRoja didn’t respond. Adamat stepped closer. “You want to live through\nthe night, don’t you?”\n“He’ll do worse to me than you ever could,” Roja said. “Besides, I don’t\nknow nothin’.”\nAdamat stepped away from Roja, turning his back. He heard Oldrich\nstep forward, followed by the heavy thump of a musket butt slamming into\nRoja’s gut. He let the beating continue for a few moments before turning\nback and waving Oldrich away.\nRoja’s face looked like he’d been through a few rounds with SouSmith.\nHe doubled over, spitting blood.\n“Where did they take Faye?” Tell me, Adamat begged silently. For your\nsake, hers, and mine. Tell me where she is. “The boy, Josep? Where is he?”\nRoja spit on the floor. “You’re him, aren’t you? The father of these\nstupid brats?” He didn’t wait for Adamat to answer. “We were gonna\nbugger all those kids. Startin’ with the small ones first. Vetas wouldn’t let\nus. But your wife…” Roja ran his tongue along his broken lips. “She was\nwilling. Thought we’d go easy on the babies if she took us all.”\nOldrich stepped forward and slammed the butt of his musket across"

        "text": "willing. Thought we’d go easy on the babies if she took us all.”\nOldrich stepped forward and slammed the butt of his musket across\nRoja’s face. Roja jerked to one side and let out a choked groan.\nAdamat felt his whole body shaking with rage. Not Faye. Not his\nbeautiful wife, his friend and partner, his confidante and the mother of his\nchildren. He held up his hand when Oldrich wound up to hit Roja again.\n“No,” Adamat said. “That’s just an average day for this one. Get me a\nlantern.”\nHe grabbed Roja by the back of the neck and dragged him out of the\nchair, pushing him outside through the back door. Roja stumbled into an\novergrown rosebush in the garden. Adamat lifted him to his feet, sure to use\nhis wounded shoulder, and shoved him along. Toward the outhouse.\n“Keep the children inside,” Adamat said to Oldrich, “and bring a few\nmen.”\nThe outhouse was wide enough for two seats, a necessity for a\nhousehold with nine children. Adamat opened the door while two of\nOldrich’s soldiers held Roja up between them. He took a lantern from\nOldrich and let it illuminate the inside of the outhouse for Roja to see.\nAdamat grabbed the board that covered the outhouse hole and tossed it\non the ground. The smell was putrid. Even after sundown the walls crawled\nwith flies.\n“I dug this hole myself,” Adamat said. “It’s eight feet deep. I should\nhave cut a new one years ago, and the family has been using it a lot lately.\nThey were here all summer.” He shined the lantern into the hole and gave\nan exaggerated sniff. “Almost full,” he said. “Where is Vetas? Where did\nthey take Faye?”\nRoja sneered at Adamat. “Go to the pit.”\n“We’re already there,” Adamat said. He grabbed Roja by the back of the\nneck and forced him into the outhouse. It was barely big enough for the two\nof them. Roja struggled, but Adamat’s strength was fueled by his rage. He\nkicked Roja’s knees out from under him and shoved the boxer’s head into\nthe hole.\n“Tell me where he is,” Adamat hissed.\nNo answer.\n“Tell me!”\n“No!” Roja’s voice echoed in the box that formed the outhouse seat.\nAdamat pushed on the back of Roja’s head. A few more inches and Roja\nwould get a face full of human waste. Adamat choked back his own disgust.\nThis was cruel. Inhuman. Then again, so was taking a man’s wife and\nchildren hostage.\nRoja’s forehead touched the top of the shit and he let out a sob.\n“Where is Vetas? I won’t ask again!”\n“I don’t know! He didn’t tell me anything. Just paid me to keep the kids\nhere.”\n“How were you paid?” Adamat heard Roja retch. The boxer’s body\nshuddered.\n“Krana notes.”\n“You’re one of the Proprietor’s boxers,” Adamat said. “Does he know\nabout any of this?”\n“Vetas said we were recommended. No one hires us for the job unless\nthe Proprietor gives the go-ahead.”"

        "text": "about any of this?”\n“Vetas said we were recommended. No one hires us for the job unless\nthe Proprietor gives the go-ahead.”\nAdamat gritted his teeth. The Proprietor. The head of the Adran criminal\nworld, and a member of Tamas’s council. He was one of the most powerful\nmen in Adro. If he knew about Lord Vetas, it could mean he’d been a traitor\nall along.\n“What else do you know?”\n“I barely spoke twenty words with the guy,” Roja said. His words were\ncoming out in broken gasps as he sputtered through his tears. “Don’t know\nanything else!”\nAdamat struck Roja on the back of the head. He sagged, but he was not\nunconscious. Adamat lifted him by his belt and shoved his face down into\nthe muck. He lifted him again and pushed. Roja flailed, his legs kicking\nhard as he tried to breathe through the piss and shit. Adamat grabbed the\nboxer by the ankles and pushed down, jamming Roja in the hole.\nAdamat turned and walked out of the outhouse. He couldn’t think\nthrough his fury. He was going to destroy Vetas for putting his wife and\nchildren through this.\nOldrich and his men stood by, watching Roja drown in filth. One of\nthem looked ill in the dim lantern light. Another was nodding in approval.\nThe night was quiet now, and Adamat could hear the steady chirp of\ncrickets in the forest.\n“Aren’t you going to ask him more questions?” Oldrich said.\n“He said himself, he doesn’t know anything else.” Adamat felt his\nstomach turn and he looked back at Roja’s kicking legs. The mental image\nof Roja forcing himself on Faye almost stopped Adamat, and then he said to\nOldrich, “Pull him out before he dies. Then ship him to the deepest coal\nmine you can find on the Mountainwatch.”\nAdamat swore to do worse to Vetas when he caught him.\nCHAPTER\n2\nF\nield Marshal Tamas stood above Budwiel’s southern gate and surveyed\nthe Kez army. This wall marked the southernmost point of Adro. If he\ntossed a stone in front of him, it would land on Kez soil, perhaps rolling\ndown the slope of the Great Northern Road until it reached the Kez pickets\non the edge of their army.\nThe Gates of Wasal, a pair of five-hundred-foot-tall cliffs, rose to either\nside of him, divided by thousands of years of flowing water coming out of\nthe Adsea, cutting through Surkov’s Alley, and feeding the grain fields of\nthe Amber Expanse in northern Kez.\nThe Kez army had left the smoldering ruins of South Pike Mountain\nonly three weeks ago. Official reports estimated the number of men in the\narmy that had besieged Shouldercrown as two hundred thousand soldiers,\naccompanied by camp followers that swelled that number to almost three-\nquarters of a million.\nHis scouts told him that the total number was over a million now.\nA small part of Tamas cowered at such a number. The world had not\nseen an army of that size since the wars of the Bleakening over fourteen\nhundred years ago. And here it was at his doorstep, trying to take his\ncountry from him."

        "text": "seen an army of that size since the wars of the Bleakening over fourteen\nhundred years ago. And here it was at his doorstep, trying to take his\ncountry from him.\nTamas could recognize a new soldier on the walls by how loud they\ngasped upon seeing the Kez army. He could smell the fear of his own men.\nThe anticipation. The dread. This was not Shouldercrown, a fortress easily\nheld by a few companies of soldiers. This was Budwiel, a trading city of\nsome hundred thousand people. The walls were in disrepair, the gates too\nnumerous and too wide.\nTamas did not let that fear show on his own face. He didn’t dare. He\nburied his tactical concerns; the terror he felt that his only son lay in\nAdopest deep in a coma; the pain that still ached in his leg despite the\nhealing powers of a god. Nothing showed on his countenance but contempt\nfor the audacity of the Kez commanders.\nSteady footfalls sounded on the stone stairs behind him, and Tamas was\njoined by General Hilanska, the commander of Budwiel’s artillery and the\nSecond Brigade.\nHilanska was an extremely portly man of about forty years old, a\nwidower of ten years, and a veteran of the Gurlish Campaigns. He was\nmissing his left arm at the shoulder, taken clean off by a cannonball thirty\nyears ago when Hilanska was not yet a captain. He had never let his arm nor\nhis weight affect his performance on a battlefield, and for that alone he had\nTamas’s respect. Never mind that his gun crews could knock the head off a\ncharging cavalryman at eight hundred yards.\nAmong Tamas’s General Staff, most of whom had been chosen for their\nskill and not their personalities, Hilanska was the closest thing Tamas had to\na friend.\n“Been watching them gather there for weeks and it still doesn’t cease to\nimpress me,” Hilanska said.\n“Their numbers?” Tamas asked.\nHilanska leaned over the edge of the wall and spit. “Their discipline.”\nHe removed his looking glass from his belt and slid it open with a well-\npracticed jerk of his one hand, then held it up to his eye. “All those damned\npaper-white tents lined up as far as the eye can see. Looks like a model.”\n“Lining up a half-million tents doesn’t make an army disciplined,”\nTamas said. “I’ve worked with Kez commanders before. In Gurla. They\nkeep their men in line with fear. It makes for a clean and pretty camp, but\nwhen armies clash, there’s no steel in their spine. They break by the third\nvolley.” Not like my men, he thought. Not like the Adran brigades.\n“Hope you’re right,” Hilanska said.\nTamas watched the Kez sentries make their rounds a half mile away,\nwell in range of Hilanska’s guns, but not worth the ammunition. The main\narmy camped almost two whole miles back; their officers feared Tamas’s\npowder mages more than they did Hilanska’s guns.\nTamas gripped the lip of the stone wall and opened his third eye.

        "text": "Tamas gripped the lip of the stone wall and opened his third eye. A wave\nof dizziness passed over him before he could see clearly into the Else. The\nworld took on a pastel glow. In the distance there were lights, glimmering\nlike the fires of an enemy patrol at night—the glow of Kez Privileged and\nWardens. He closed his third eye and rubbed at his temple.\n“You’re still thinking about it, aren’t you?” Hilanska asked.\n“What?”\n“Invading.”\n“Invade?” Tamas scoffed. “I’d have to be mad to launch an attack\nagainst an army ten times our size.”\n“You’ve got that look to you, Tamas,” Hilanska said. “Like a dog pulling\nat its chain. I’ve known you too long. You’ve made no secret that you\nintend to invade Kez given the opportunity.”\nTamas eyed those pickets. The Kez army was set so far back it would be\nalmost impossible to catch them unawares. The terrain gave no good cover\nfor a night attack.\n“If I could get the Seventh and Ninth in there with the element of\nsurprise, I could carve through the heart of their army and be back in\nBudwiel before they knew what hit them,” Tamas said quietly. His heart\nquickened at the thought. The Kez were not to be underestimated. They had\nthe numbers. They still had a few Privileged, even after the Battle of\nShouldercrown.\nBut Tamas knew what his best brigades were capable of. He knew Kez\nstrategies, and he knew their weaknesses. Kez soldiers were levies from\ntheir immense peasant population. Their officers were nobles who’d bought\ntheir commissions. Not like his men: patriots, men of steel and iron.\n“A few of my boys did some exploring,” Hilanska said.\n“They did?” Tamas quelled the annoyance of having his thoughts\ninterrupted.\n“You know about Budwiel’s catacombs?”\nTamas grunted in acknowledgment. The catacombs stretched under the\nWest Pillar, one of the two mountains that made up the Gates of Wasal.\nThey were a mixture of natural and man-made caverns used to house\nBudwiel’s dead.\n“They’re off limits to soldiers,” Tamas said, unable to keep the reproach\nfrom his voice.\n“I’ll deal with my boys, but you might want to hear what they have to\nsay before we have them flogged.”\n“Unless they discovered a Kez spy ring, I doubt it’s relevant.”\n“Better,” Hilanska said. “They found a way for you to get your men into\nKez.”\nTamas felt his heart jump at the possibility. “Take me to them.”\nCHAPTER\n3\nT\naniel stared at the ceiling only a foot above him, counting each time he\nswung, side to side, in the hemp-rope hammock, listening to the Gurlish\npipes that filled the room with a soft, whistling music.\nHe hated that music.

        "text": "count of the hammock swings somewhere around ten and exhaled. Warm\nsmoke curled out from between his lips and against the crumbling mortar in\nthe ceiling. He watched the smoke escape the roof of his niche and swirl\ninto the middle of the mala den.\nThere were a dozen such niches in the room. Two were occupied. In the\ntwo weeks he’d been there, Taniel had yet to see the occupants get up to\npiss or eat or do anything other than suck on the long-stemmed mala pipes\nand flag the den’s owner over for a refill.\nHe leaned over, his hand reaching for a refill for his own mala pipe. The\ntable next to his hammock held a plate with a few scraps of dark mala, an\nempty purse, and a pistol. He couldn’t remember where the pistol came\nfrom.\nTaniel gathered the bits of mala together into one small, sticky ball and\npushed it into the end of his pipe. It lit instantly, and he took a long pull into\nhis lungs.\n“Want more?”\nThe den’s owner sidled up to Taniel’s hammock. He was Gurlish, his\nskin brown but not as dark as a Deliv’s, with a lighter tone under his eyes\nand on his palms. He was tall, like most Gurlish, and skinny, his back bent\nfrom years of leaning into the niches of his mala den to clean them out or\nlight an addict’s pipe. His name was Kin.\nTaniel reached for his purse, wiggled his fingers around inside before\nremembering that it was empty. “No money,” he said, his own voice ragged\nin his ears.\nHow long had he been here? Two weeks, Taniel decided after putting his\nmind to the question. More importantly, how did he get here?\nNot here, the mala den, but here in Adopest. Taniel remembered the\nfight on top of Kresimir’s palace as Ka-poel destroyed the Kez Cabal, and\nhe remembered pulling the trigger of his rifle and watching a bullet take the\ngod Kresimir in the eye.\nIt was all darkness after that until he woke up, covered in sweat, Ka-poel\nstraddling him with fresh blood on her hands. He remembered bodies in the\nhallway of the hotel—his father’s soldiers with an unfamiliar insignia on\ntheir jackets. He’d left the hotel and stumbled here, where he’d hoped to\nforget.\nOf course, if he still remembered all that, then the mala wasn’t doing its\njob.\n“Army jacket,” Kin said, fingering his lapel. “Your buttons.”\nTaniel looked down at the jacket he wore. It was Adran-army dark blue,\nwith silver trim and buttons. He’d taken it from the hotel. It wasn’t his—too\nbig. There was a powder mage pin—a silver powder keg—pinned to the\nlapel. Maybe it was his. Had he lost weight?\nThe jacket had been clean two days ago. He remembered that much.\nNow it was stained with drool, bits of food, and small burns from mala\nembers.

        "text": "embers. When the pit had he eaten?\nTaniel pulled his belt knife and took one of the buttons in his fingers. He\npaused. Kin’s daughter walked through the room. She wore a faded white\ndress, clean despite the squalor of the den. She must have been a few years\nolder than Taniel, but no children clung to her skirts.\n“Do you like my daughter?” Kin asked. “She will dance for you. Two\nbuttons!” He held up two fingers for emphasis. “Much prettier than the\nFatrastan witch.”\nKin’s wife, sitting in the corner and playing the Gurlish pipes, stopped\nthe music long enough to say something to Kin. They exchanged a few\nwords in Gurlish, then Kin turned back to Taniel. “Two buttons!” he\nreiterated.\nTaniel cut a button loose and put it in Kin’s hand. Dance, eh? Taniel\nwondered if Kin had a strong enough grasp of Adran for euphemism, or if\ndance was indeed all she’d do.\n“Maybe later,” Taniel said, settling back in the hammock with a fresh\nball of mala the size of a child’s fist. “Ka-poel isn’t a witch. She’s…” He\npaused, trying to figure out a way to describe her to a Gurlish. His thoughts\nmoved slowly, sluggish from the mala. “All right,” he conceded. “She’s a\nwitch.”\nTaniel topped off his mala pipe. Kin’s daughter was watching him. He\nreturned her open stare with a half-lidded gaze. She was pretty, by some\nstandards. Too tall by far for Taniel, and much too gaunt—most Gurlish\nwere. She stayed there, laundry balanced on her hip, until her father shooed\nher out.\nHow long had it been since he’d had a woman?\nA woman? He laughed, smoke curling out his nose. The laugh ended in\na cough and received no more than a curious glance from Kin. No, not a\nwoman. The woman. Vlora. How long had it been? Two and a half years\nnow? Three?\nHe sat back up and fished around in his pocket for a powder charge,\nwondering where Vlora was now. Probably still with Tamas and the rest of\nthe powder cabal.\nTamas would want Taniel back on the front line.\nTo the pit with that. Let Tamas come to Adopest looking for Taniel. The\nlast place he’d look was a mala den.\nThere wasn’t a powder charge in Taniel’s pocket. Ka-poel had cleaned\nhim out. He’d not had a smidgen of powder since she brought him out of\nthat goddamned coma. Not even his pistol was loaded. He could go out and\nget some. Find a barracks, show them his powder-mage pin.\nThe very idea of getting out of the hammock made his head spin.\nKa-poel came down the steps into the mala den just as Taniel was\nbeginning to drift off. He kept his eyes mostly closed, the smoke curling\nfrom his lips. She stopped and examined him.\nShe was short, her features petite.

He didn’t like it so\nshort, it made her look boyish. No mistaking her for a boy, Taniel thought\nas she shrugged out of her long black duster. Underneath she wore a white\nsleeveless shirt, scrounged from who-knew-where, and close-fitting black\npants.\nKa-poel touched Taniel’s shoulder. He ignored her. Let her think him\nasleep, or too deep in a mala haze to notice her. All the better.\nShe reached out and squeezed his nose shut with one hand, pushing his\nmouth closed with the other.\nHe jerked up, taking a breath when she let go. “What the pit, Pole?\nTrying to kill me?”\nShe smiled, and it wasn’t the first time under the mala haze that he’d\nstared into those glass-green eyes with less than proper thoughts. He shook\nthem away. She was his ward. He was her protector. Or was it the other way\naround? She was the one who’d done the protecting up on South Pike.\nTaniel settled back into the hammock. “What do you want?”\nShe held up a thick pad of paper, bound in leather. A sketchbook. To\nreplace the one lost on South Pike Mountain. He felt a pang at that.\nSketches from eight years of his life. People he’d known, many of them\nlong dead. Some friends, some enemies. Losing that sketchbook hurt almost\nas much as losing his genuine Hrusch rifle.\nAlmost as much as…\nHe pushed the stem of his mala pipe between his teeth and sucked in\nhard. He shivered as the smoke burned his throat and lungs and seeped into\nhis body, deadening the memories.\nWhen he reached out for the sketchbook, he saw that his hand was\nshaking. He snatched it back quickly.\nKa-poel’s eyes narrowed. She set the sketchbook on his stomach,\nfollowed by a pack of charcoal pencils. Finer sketching tools than he’d ever\nhad in Fatrasta. She pointed at them, and mimed him sketching.\nTaniel made his right hand into a fist. He didn’t want her to see him\nshaking. “I… not now, Pole.”\nShe pointed again, more insistently.\nTaniel took another deep breath of mala and closed his eyes. He felt\ntears roll down his cheeks.\nHe felt her take the book and pencils off his chest. Heard the table move.\nHe expected a reproach. A punch. Something. When he opened his eyes\nagain, he saw her bare feet disappearing up the stairs of the mala den and\nshe was gone. He took another deep breath of mala and wiped the tears off\nhis face.\nThe room began to fade into the mala haze along with his memories; all\nthe people he’d killed, all the friends he’d seen die. The god he’d seen with\nhis own eyes, and then put down with an ensorcelled bullet. He didn’t want\nto remember any of that.\nJust another few days in the mala den, then he’d be fine.

He’d report to Tamas and get back to what he was good at: killing Kez.\nTamas found himself a quarter mile under a thousand tons of rock just a few\nhours after leaving Budwiel’s walls. His torch flickered in the darkness,\ncasting light and shadows across the row after row of recessed graves\ncarved into the walls of the caverns. Skulls hung from the ceilings by the\nhundred in a grisly tribute to the dead, and he wondered if this was what the\npathway to the afterlife looked like.\nMore fire, he imagined.\nHe fought off his initial claustrophobia by reminding himself that these\ncatacombs had been used for a thousand years. They weren’t likely to\ncollapse anytime soon.\nThe size of the passageway surprised him. At times the rooms were wide\nenough to hold hundreds of men. At their narrowest, even a carriage could\npass through them without scraping the sides.\nThe two artillery men Hilanska had spoken of walked on ahead. They\ncarried their own torches and they talked excitedly, their voices echoing as\nthey passed through the varied chambers. Beside Tamas, his bodyguard\nOlem kept pace with a hand on his pistol and a suspicious eye on the two\nsoldiers ahead of him. Bringing up the rear were two of Tamas’s best\npowder mages: Vlora and Andriya.\n“These caverns,” Olem said, running his fingers along the stone walls,\n“were widened with tools. But look at the ceiling.” He pointed upward. “No\ntool marks.”\n“They were carved out by water,” Tamas said. “Probably thousands of\nyears ago.” He let his eyes run over the ceiling and then down to the floor.\nTheir path sloped gently downward, punctuated from time to time by steps\ncut into the floor and worn by the passing of thousands of pilgrims,\nfamilies, and priests every year. Despite these signs of use, these catacombs\nwere empty of anything living—the priests had suspended burials during\nthe siege, worried that artillery fire might collapse some of the caves.\nTamas used to play in caverns like these when his father, an apothecary,\nsearched the mountains every summer for rare flowers, mushrooms, and\nfungus. Some cave systems went incredibly deep into the heart of the\nmountain. Others ended abruptly, just when things seemed to be getting\ninteresting.\nThe passageway opened up into a wide cavern. The torchlight no longer\ndanced on the ceiling and far walls, but disappeared into the darkness\nabove. They stood on the edge of a pool of still water blacker than a\nmoonless night. Their voices echoed in the great hollow space.\nTamas came to a stop beside the waiting artillery men. He cracked a\npowder charge in between his fingers and sprinkled it on his tongue. The\ntrance swept through him, bringing dizziness and clarity all at once. The\nache of his leg disappeared and the tendrils of light caused by the torches\nwere suddenly more than enough for him to examine the cavern in its\nentirety.\nThe walls were lined with stone sarcophagi, stacked almost haphazardly"

A dripping sound\nechoed through the chamber: the source of the underground lake. Tamas\ncould see no exit but the one through which they’d come.\n“Sir?” one of the artillerymen said. His name was Ludik, and he held his\ntorch over the pool, trying to gauge the depths.\n“We’re thousands of feet beneath the West Pillar,” Tamas said. “And no\ncloser to Kez. I don’t like being led into strange places.”\nThe cock of Olem’s pistol stirred the silence of the cave. Behind Tamas,\nVlora and Andriya stood with their rifles at the ready. Ludik exchanged a\nnervous glance with his comrade and swallowed hard.\n“It looks like the cave system ends,” Ludik said, pointing with his torch\nacross the pond. “But it doesn’t. It keeps going, and goes straight toward\nKez.”\n“How do you know?” Tamas asked.\nLudik hesitated, expecting reproach. “Because, sir, we followed it\nthrough.”\n“Show me.”\nThey passed behind a pair of sarcophagi on the other side of the pond\nand ducked beneath a ledge that proved deeper than it looked. A moment\nlater, and Tamas was standing on the other side. The cavern opened up\nagain and led down into the dark.\nTamas turned to the bodyguard at his shoulder. “Try not to shoot anyone\nunless I say so.”\nOlem stroked his neatly trimmed beard, eyeing the artillerymen. “Of\ncourse, sir.” His hand didn’t leave the butt of his pistol. Olem wasn’t the\ntrusting sort these days.\nAn hour later, Tamas left the cavern and climbed up through brush and\nscree into daylight. The sun had passed over the mountains to the east and\nthe valley was in shadow.\n“All clear, sir,” Olem said, helping him up to steady footing.\nTamas checked his pistol, then absently thumbed the contents of another\npowder charge onto his tongue. They stood in a steep valley on the southern\nslope of the Adran Mountains. By his guess, they were less than two miles\nfrom Budwiel. If that was correct, they now flanked the Kez army perfectly.\n“An old riverbed, sir,” Vlora said, picking her way among the small\nboulders. “It points to the west, then cuts south. The base of the valley is\nobscured by a hillock. We’re not more than a half mile from the Kez right\nnow, but there’s no sign they’ve even bothered scouting this valley.”\n“Sir!” a voice called from within the cave.\nTamas whirled. Vlora, Olem, and Andriya all raised their rifles, pointing\ninto the darkness.\nAn Adran soldier emerged. His shoulder sported a chevron with a\npowder horn beneath it. The man was a lance corporal, one of Olem’s new\ncompany of elite soldiers, the Riflejacks.\n“Quiet, fool,” Olem hissed. “You want all of Kez to hear?”\nThe messenger wiped the sweat from his brow, blinking up at the"

Gasping messengers were never a\ngood sign. They never hurried unless it was of utmost importance.\n“The Kez, sir,” the messenger said. “Our spies report they will attack en\nmasse the day after tomorrow. General Hilanska requests you back at the\nwall immediately.”\nTamas ran his eyes across the steep valley in which they stood. “How\nmany men do you think we could bring through here in two days?”\n“Thousands,” Vlora said.\n“Ten thousand,” Olem added.\n“A hammer of two brigades,” Tamas said. “And Budwiel will be the\nanvil.”\nVlora seemed doubtful. “That’s a small hammer, sir, compared with that\nmonstrous force out there.”\n“Then we’ll have to strike hard and fast.” Tamas examined the valley\none more time. “Let’s head back. Have the engineers start widening the\ntunnel. Get some men up here to shore up this scree so our passage won’t\ncause a ruckus. When the Kez attack, we’ll smash them against the gates of\nBudwiel.”\nCHAPTER\n4\nT\nhere were few things in the world more tedious, Nila reflected as she sat\non the kitchen floor and watched flames curl around the base of the\nimmense iron pot hanging over the fire, than waiting for water to boil.\nMost manor houses would be silent at this hour. She’d always relished\nthe quiet—the still night air that insulated her from the chaos of a servant’s\nlife when the master and mistress were at home and the house bustled with\nmovement. There was a night not more than a few months past, though it\nfelt like years, that Nila had known no life but the one in which she boiled\nwater and did the laundry every week for Duke Eldaminse’s family and the\nserving staff.\nLord Eldaminse was dead now, his servants scattered and his home\nburned. Everything Nila had ever known was gone.\nHere in Lord Vetas’s city manor on a side street in the middle of\nAdopest, the household never slept.\nSomewhere in the enormous house a man was shouting. Nila couldn’t\nmake out the words, but they were spoken in anger. Probably Dourford, the\nPrivileged. He was one of Lord Vetas’s lieutenants, and he had a temper like\nNila had never seen. He had a habit of beating the cooks. Everyone in the\nhouse feared him, even the hulking bodyguards who accompanied Lord\nVetas on his errands.\nEveryone feared Dourford except, of course, for Vetas.\nAs far as Nila could tell, Lord Vetas feared nothing.\n“Jakob,” Nila said, speaking to the six-year-old boy sitting beside her on\nthe kitchen floor, “hand me the lye.”\nJakob got to his feet and paused, frowning at her. “Where?” he asked."

        "text": "the kitchen floor, “hand me the lye.”\nJakob got to his feet and paused, frowning at her. “Where?” he asked.\n“Under the washbasin,” Nila said. “The glass jar.”\nJakob rummaged around beneath the washbasin before finding the jar.\nHe grabbed it by the lid and pulled.\n“Careful!” Nila said. She was on her feet and beside him in a moment,\nand caught him by the shoulders as the jar came loose and he stumbled\nbackward. She put a hand beneath the jar. “Got you,” she said, and took the\njar. It wasn’t very heavy, but Jakob had never been the strongest child.\nShe unscrewed the lid and doled out a measure for the laundry with a\nspoon.\n“No,” she said when Jakob reached for the open jar. “You don’t want to\ntouch that. It’s very poisonous. It’ll eat right through your pink fingers.”\nShe snatched him by the hand and playfully bit at his fingers. “Like an\nangry dog!”\nJakob giggled and retreated across the room. Nila put the lye away on a\nhigh shelf. They shouldn’t keep materials like this within reach of children.\nEven if Jakob was the only child in the house.\nNila wondered what life would be like if she was still in the Eldaminse\nmanor. There would have been a party for Jakob’s sixth birthday two weeks\nago. The house staff would have been given a stipend and an extra\nafternoon off. Duke Eldaminse would have likely made another pass at Nila\n—or two, or three—and Lady Eldaminse would have considered putting her\nout on the street.\nNila missed the quiet of the nights doing laundry for the Eldaminse\nhouse. She didn’t miss backbiting and jealousy among the serving staff, or\nLord Eldaminse’s groping hands. But she’d exchanged it for something\nworse.\nLord Vetas’s manor.\nThere was a scream from somewhere in the basement, where Lord Vetas\nkept his… room.\n“Pit,” Nila said softly to herself, eyes back on the flame of the kitchen\nfire.\n“A lady doesn’t curse.”\nNila felt her spine stiffen. The voice was quiet, calm. Deceptively\nplacid, like the surface of the ocean undisturbed by the sharks circling\nbeneath.\n“Lord Vetas.” She turned and curtsied to the man standing in the kitchen\ndoor.\nVetas was a Rosvelean with dusty-yellow skin. His back was straight,\none hand tucked into his vest pocket and the other holding his evening glass\nof red wine with casual familiarity. Seen on the street, he might be mistaken\nfor a well-dressed clerk or merchant with his white shirt, dark-blue vest, and\nblack pants that she’d neatly pressed herself.\nNila knew that to assume anything about Vetas was a deadly mistake. He\nwas a killer. She’d felt his hands on her throat. She’d looked into his eyes—\neyes that seemed to see everything at once—and seen the dispassion with\nwhich he regarded living things.\n“I’m not a lady, my lord,” Nila said.\nVetas’s eyes examined her clinically. Nila felt stripped beneath that gaze.\nShe felt like a piece of meat on the butcher’s block. It frightened her."

It frightened her.\nAnd it made her angry. She wondered for a moment if Lord Vetas would\nlook that calm and collected in his casket.\n“Do you know why you’re here?” Vetas said.\n“To watch over Jakob.” She cast a glance at the boy. Jakob watched\nVetas curiously.\n“That’s right.” A smile suddenly split Vetas’s face, warmth flooding his\nexpression without touching his eyes. “Come here, boy,” Vetas said,\nkneeling. “It’s all right, Jakob. Don’t be afraid.”\nJakob’s training as a noble’s son left him no choice but to obey. He\nstarted toward Vetas, looking back to Nila for direction.\nNila felt her chest go cold. She wanted to throw herself between them, to\ntake a hot iron from the fire and beat Vetas back. The false smile on his face\nwas far more frightening to her than his customary stoic gaze.\n“Go ahead,” she heard herself say in a small voice.\n“I brought you a candy.” Vetas handed Jakob a treat wrapped in colored\npaper.\n“Jakob, don’t…” Nila started.\nVetas fixed her with his eyes. There was no threat behind them, no\nemotion. Just a cold glance.\n“You can have it,” Nila said, “but you should save it for tomorrow, after\nbreakfast.”\nVetas gave Jakob the candy and tousled his hair.\nDon’t touch him, Nila screamed inside. She forced herself to smile at\nVetas.\n“Why is Jakob here, my lord?” Nila said, pushing the question through\nher fear.\nVetas got to his feet. “That’s no concern of yours. Do you know how to\nbehave like a lady, Nila?” he asked.\n“I… I suppose. I’m just a laundress.”\n“I think you’re more than that,” Vetas said. “Everyone has the ability to\nrise above their station. You survived the royalist barricades, then infiltrated\nField Marshal Tamas’s headquarters with the aim of rescuing young Jakob\nhere. And you’re pretty. No one ever looks past beauty, if it’s dressed right.”\nNila wondered how Vetas could possibly have known about the royalist\nbarricades. She’d told him about Tamas’s headquarters, but… what exactly\ndid he mean about beauty?\n“I may have further use for you than just”—he made a gesture toward\nJakob and the laundry—“this.”\nJakob was too busy trying to nibble at his candy as discreetly as possible\nto notice the disdain in Vetas’s voice. Nila wasn’t. And she feared what he\nmeant by “further use.”\n“My lord.” She curtsied again, and tried not to let her hatred show on her\nface. She might be able to kill him in the bath. Like she’d read in those\nmystery novels she’d borrowed from the butler’s son at the Eldaminse\nhouse.\n“In the meantime,” Vetas said. He stepped into the hall outside the\nkitchen, keeping the door open with one foot. “Bring her in here,” he called."

A woman screamed in anger—an angry-wildcat yell.\nThere was a struggle in the hall and two of Vetas’s bodyguards dragged a\nwoman into the kitchen. She was in her forties perhaps, her body sagging in\nall the wrong places from having had too many children, her skin wrinkled\nfrom work but unweathered by the sun. Her curly black hair was tucked\nback behind her head in a bun and the bags beneath her eyes spoke of little\nsleep.\nThe woman stopped when she caught sight of Nila and Jakob.\n“Where is my son?” she spat at Vetas.\n“In the basement,” Vetas said, “and he won’t be harmed as long as you\ncooperate.”\n“Liar!”\nA patronizing smile touched Vetas’s lips. “Nila, Jakob. This is Faye. She\nis unwell and must be watched at all times, lest she hurt herself. She’s going\nto share your room, Jakob. Can you help watch her, my boy?”\nJakob nodded solemnly.\n“Good lad.”\n“I’ll kill you,” Faye said to Vetas.\nVetas stepped to Faye and whispered something in her ear. She stiffened,\nthe color draining from her face.\n“Now,” Vetas said, “Faye is going to take over your responsibilities,\nNila. She’ll do the laundry, and help with Jakob.”\nNila exchanged a glance with the woman. She felt the knot of fear in her\nbelly reflected on Faye’s face.\n“And me?” Nila knew what Vetas would do with someone who didn’t\nhave a use. She still remembered Jakob’s dead nurse—the one who’d\nrefused to go along with Vetas’s schemes.\nVetas suddenly crossed the room. He took Nila by the chin, turning her\nface one way and then another. He forced his thumb into her mouth and she\nhad to keep herself from biting down as he examined her teeth. He stepped\naway suddenly, and wiped his hands on a kitchen towel as if he’d just\nhandled an animal.\n“Your hands show very little wear from the laundering. Remarkably\nlittle, to be honest. I’ll give you some lotion in the morning and you’ll apply\nit every hour. We’ll have those hands looking soft, like a noblewoman’s, in\nno time.” He patted her on the cheek.\nNila resisted the urge to spit in his eye.\nVetas leaned forward and spoke quietly so that Jakob could not hear.\n“This woman,” Vetas said, pointing to Faye, “is your responsibility, Nila. If\nshe displeases me, you’ll suffer for it. Jakob will suffer for it. And believe\nme, I know how to make people suffer.”\nVetas stepped away, throwing a smile toward Jakob. More loudly he\nsaid, “I think you need some new clothes, Jakob. Would you like that?”\n“Very much, sir,” Jakob said.\n“We’ll do that tomorrow. Some toys, too.”\nVetas glanced at Nila, his eyes holding a silent warning, and he left the\nroom with his bodyguards.\nFaye adjusted her dress and took a deep breath. Her eyes traveled around"

Her eyes traveled around\nthe room. A mix of emotions ranged across her face: anger, panic, and fear.\nFor a moment Nila thought she might snatch up a frying pan and attack her.\nNila wondered who she was. Why was she here? Obviously another\nprisoner. Another player in Vetas’s schemes. Could Nila trust her?\n“I’m Nila,” she said. “And this is Jakob.”\nFaye’s eyes settled on Nila and she nodded with a frown. “I’m Faye.\nAnd I’m going to kill that bastard.”\nCHAPTER\n5\nA\ndamat slipped through the side door of one of the dilapidated buildings\nin Adopest’s dock district. He moved down hallways, brushing past\nsecretaries and bookkeepers, always looking straight ahead. In his\nexperience, no one questioned a man who knew where he was going.\nAdamat knew that Lord Vetas was looking for him.\nIt wasn’t hard to surmise. Vetas still had Faye. He still had leverage, and\nno doubt he wanted Adamat dead or under his thumb.\nSo Adamat stayed low. Field Marshal Tamas’s soldiers were protecting\nhis family—part of the bargain Adamat had struck with the field marshal in\norder to keep his neck from the guillotine. Adamat had to work from the\nshadows now, finding Lord Vetas and discovering his plans, and freeing\nFaye before any more harm could come to her. If she was even still alive.\nHe couldn’t do it alone.\nThe headquarters for the Noble Warriors of Labor was a squat, ugly\nbrick building not far from the Adopest docks. It didn’t look like much, but\nit housed the offices of the biggest union in all the Nine. Every subdivision\nof the Warriors moved through this hub: bankers, steelworkers, miners,\nbakers, millers, and more.\nBut Adamat only needed to speak with one man, and he didn’t want to\nbe noticed on his way in. He went down a low-ceilinged hallway on the\nthird floor and paused outside an office door. He could hear voices inside.\n“I don’t care what you think of the idea,” came the voice of Ricard\nTumblar, head of the entire union. “I’m going to find him and persuade him.\nHe’s the best man for the job.”\n“Man?” a woman’s voice returned. “You don’t think a woman can do\nit?”\n“Don’t start with me, Cheris,” Ricard said. “It was a turn of phrase. And\ndon’t make this about men or women. You don’t like it because he’s a\nsoldier.”\n“And you bloody well know why.”\nRicard’s retort was lost as Adamat heard the creak of the floorboards\nbehind him. He turned to find a woman standing behind him.\nShe looked to be in her midthirties, with straight blond hair tied back in\na ponytail behind her head. She wore a dress uniform with loose pants and a\nwhite frilled shirt of the type that might be worn by a footman. Her hands\nwere clasped behind her back.\nA secretary. The last thing Adamat needed."

I didn’t mean to\neavesdrop, I just needed to speak with Ricard.”\nShe didn’t sound at all like she believed him. “The secretary should have\nkept you in the waiting room.”\n“I came in the side door,” Adamat admitted. So she wasn’t the secretary?\nThe woman said, “Come with me to the lobby and we’ll make you an\nappointment. Mr. Tumblar is terribly busy.”\nAdamat gave a half bow at the waist. “I’d rather not make an\nappointment. I just need to speak with Ricard. It’s a terribly urgent matter.”\n“Please, sir.”\n“I just need to speak with Ricard.”\nHer voice dropped slightly—instantly more threatening. “If you do not\ncome with me, I will have you taken to the police for trespassing.”\n“Now look here!” Adamat raised his voice. The last thing he wanted to\ndo was cause a commotion, but he desperately needed Ricard’s attention.\n“Fell!” Ricard’s voice called from inside the office. “Fell! Damn it, Fell,\nwhat is that ruckus!”\nFell narrowed her eyes at Adamat. “What is your name?” she asked\nsternly.\n“Inspector Adamat.”\nFell’s demeanor changed instantly. Gone was the severe gaze that\nbrooked no argument. She let out a soft sigh. “Why didn’t you say so to\nbegin with? Ricard has us looking all over the city for you.” She stepped\npast Adamat and opened the door. “It’s Inspector Adamat here to see you,\nsir.”\n“Well, don’t leave him in the hallway. Send him in!”\nThe room was cluttered but clean—for once. Bookshelves ran the length\nof each wall, and an ironwood desk framed the center of the room. Ricard\nwas sitting behind his desk, facing a woman who looked to be about fifty.\nAdamat could immediately tell she was wealthy. Her rings were gold, set\nwith precious gems, and her dress made from the finest cut of muslin. She\nfanned her face with a fine lace handkerchief and pointedly looked away\nfrom Adamat.\n“You’ll have to excuse me, Cheris,” Ricard said. “This is very\nimportant.”\nThe woman pushed past Adamat and left the room. Adamat heard the\ndoor slam behind him and they were alone. Adamat thought briefly to ask\nwhat that had been about—then decided against it. Ricard was just as likely\nto spend an hour explaining as he was to tell Adamat it was private\nbusiness.

The street gang that supposedly reported to\nRicard, but that had come after Adamat in his own home. Had that really\nbeen only a month ago?

He\ndidn’t precisely blame Ricard for the incident, but he now had far less faith\nin Ricard’s people.\n“Is Faye still out of the city?” Ricard said.\nSomething must have showed in Adamat’s eyes.

He’d fought with himself for days about whether to\ncome to Ricard at all, and what exactly to say. It wasn’t as if he didn’t trust\nRicard—it was that he didn’t trust Ricard’s people. Lord Vetas had spies\neverywhere. But if he couldn’t trust Ricard himself, then there was no one\nleft in his life to turn to for help.\n“Faye and the children were taken by a man named Lord Vetas,”\nAdamat said. “They were held against their will to guarantee my\ncooperation. I gave Vetas information about my conversations with Tamas\nand my investigation.”\nRicard tensed. Whatever he’d expected, this was not it. “You crossed\nTamas?” And you’re still alive? was the unspoken question.\n“I’ve told Tamas all of it,” Adamat said. “He has forgiven me—for now\n—and sent me on a hunt for Lord Vetas. I managed to rescue some of the\nchildren, but Vetas still has Faye and Josep.”\n“Can’t you use Tamas’s soldiers to go after Vetas?”\n“I’d have to find him first. Once I do, I wish it were that simple. The\nmoment Vetas finds out where I am, he will no doubt threaten me with\nFaye’s life. I need to find him silently, track him, and get her out of his\nhands before I bring down Tamas’s wrath upon him.”\nRicard nodded slowly. “So you don’t know where he is?”\n“He’s like a ghost. I looked into him when he first started blackmailing\nme. He doesn’t even exist.”\n“If you can’t find him, I doubt any of my people can.”\n“I don’t need you to find him. I need information.” Adamat reached into\nhis pocket and removed the card Vetas had left him months ago. It had an"

It had an\naddress on it. “This is the only lead I have. It’s an old warehouse not all that\nfar from here. I need to know everything about it. Who owns it? Who owns\nthe properties around it? When was it last sold? Everything. Your people\nhave access to records I can’t easily get my hands on.”\nRicard nodded. “Of course. Anything.” He reached to take the card.\nAdamat stopped him, clutching Ricard’s hand. “This is deadly serious.\nThe lives of my wife and my son depend on it. If you don’t think you can\ntrust your people, just tell me now and I’ll find him myself.” Remember\nwhat happened with the Barbers, Adamat said silently.\nRicard seemed to get the message. “I have some people,” Ricard said.\n“Don’t worry. This will be safe.”\n“One more thing,” Adamat said. “There are two people involved in this\nsomehow that you might blanch at crossing.”\nRicard smiled. “If it’s not Tamas, I can’t imagine who.”\n“Lord Claremonte and the Proprietor.”\nRicard’s smile disappeared. “Lord Claremonte doesn’t surprise me,” he\nsaid. “The Brudania-Gurla Trading Company has been trying to move in on\nthe union since our inception. He’s tricky, but he doesn’t scare me.”\n“Don’t be so quick to dismiss him. Lord Vetas works for him.” And\nVetas was holding Adamat’s wife and son hostage. Claremonte, as far as\nAdamat was concerned, might as well have been holding Faye and Josep\npersonally.\nRicard made a dismissive gesture. “You say that the Proprietor might be\ninvolved? I don’t trust him, of course, but I thought you cleared him of\ntreachery yourself.”\n“I never cleared him,” Adamat said. “I just found out that Charlemund\nwas the one trying to kill Tamas. One of the Proprietor’s boxers was\nholding my family hostage. You know how he is about his boxers finding\nwork elsewhere—no one works for someone else without the Proprietor’s\npermission.” Which meant that the Proprietor may be in league with Lord\nClaremonte.\n“Tread carefully on this, my friend,” Ricard warned. “Vetas may be\ntrying to use you, but the Proprietor will cut and bury your entire family\nwithout so much as a thought.” He glanced at the card Adamat had given\nhim and put it in his vest pocket. “I’ll look into this, don’t worry. But I need\na favor from you.”\n“Go on.”\n“Do you know Taniel Two-Shot?”\n“I know of him,” Adamat said. “Everyone in the Nine does. The\nnewspapers were saying he was in a coma after a battle of sorcery on top of\nSouth Pike Mountain.”\n“He’s not in a coma anymore,” Ricard said. “He woke up a week ago,\nand he’s disappeared.”\nAdamat’s first thoughts went to Lord Vetas.

        "text": "and he’s disappeared.”\nAdamat’s first thoughts went to Lord Vetas. The man was working\nactively against Tamas. He would leap at the chance to capture the field\nmarshal’s son. “Any sign of violence?”\nRicard shook his head. “Well, yes. But it’s not like that. He left his guard\nduty of his own volition. Tamas had his own men guarding him, but my\npeople were keeping an eye on him as well. That he slipped both our nets is\nrather embarrassing. I need him found quietly.”\n“Do you want him returned?” Adamat said. “I’m not about to make a\npowder mage do something he doesn’t want to do.”\n“No, just find out where he is and let me know.”\nAdamat stood up. “I’ll see what I can do.”\n“And I’ll look into this Lord Vetas.” Ricard held up a hand to forestall\nAdamat’s protests. “Discreetly. I promise.”\nTamas entered Budwiel’s biggest mess hall and was nearly knocked over by\nthe swirl of enticing smells wafting from inside.\nHe swept past the tables where hundreds of his men were having their\nevening repast and headed toward the kitchens, trying to ignore his hunger\npangs.\nThe man he was looking for was hard to miss: big, fat, taller than most,\nwith waist-length black hair tied behind his head and his olive skin showing\njust a touch of Rosvelean ancestry. He stood in one corner of the kitchens,\non his toes to be able to see into the highest row of ovens.\nMihali was, officially, Tamas’s chef. He and his cadre of assistants\nprovided food of the highest caliber for Tamas’s entire army, and even for\nthe city of Budwiel. The people loved Mihali; the men worshipped him.\nWell, perhaps they should worship him.\nHe was Adom reborn, patron saint of Adro, and brother to the god\nKresimir. Which made him a god in his own right.\nMihali turned to Tamas and waved across the myriad of assistants, flour\ngoing up in a cloud around him.\n“Field Marshal,” the chef called. “Come over here.”\nTamas stifled the annoyance at being summoned like a common soldier\nand made his way through the tables of bread.\n“Mihali—”\nThe god-chef cut him off. “Field Marshal, I’m so glad you’re here. I\nhave a matter of great importance to discuss with you.”\nGreat importance? Tamas had never seen Mihali so distressed. He\nleaned forward. What could possibly worry a god? “What is it?”\n“I can’t decide what to make for lunch tomorrow.”\n“You git!” Tamas exclaimed, taking a step back. His heart thundered in\nhis ears, as if he’d expected Mihali to announce that the world would end\non the morrow.\nMihali didn’t seem to notice the insult. “I haven’t not known what to\ncook for decades. I normally have it all planned out but… I’m sorry, are you\nmad about something?”\n“I’m trying to fight a war here, Mihali! The Kez are knocking at\nBudwiel’s front door.”\n“And hunger is knocking at mine!”\nMihali seemed so out of sorts that Tamas forced himself to calm down."

        "text": "Budwiel’s front door.”\n“And hunger is knocking at mine!”\nMihali seemed so out of sorts that Tamas forced himself to calm down.\nHe put a hand on Mihali’s arm. “The men will love whatever you make.”\n“I’d planned poached eggs with asparagus tips, filet of salmon, lamb\nchops glazed with honey, and a selection of fruit.”\n“That’s three meals you just named there,” Tamas said.\n“Three meals? Three meals? That’s four courses, barely enough for a\nproper lunch, and I did the same thing five days ago. What kind of a chef\nserves the same meal more than once a week?” Mihali tapped flour-covered\nfingers against his chin. “How could I have messed up? Maybe it’s a leap\nyear.”\nTamas counted to ten silently to keep his temper contained—something\nhe’d not done since Taniel was a boy. “Mihali, we’re going into battle the\nday after tomorrow. Will you help me?”\nThe god appeared nervous. “I’m not going to kill anyone, if that’s what\nyou’re asking,” Mihali said.\n“Can you do anything for us? We’re outnumbered ten to one out there.”\n“What is your plan?”\n“I’m going to take the Seventh and the Ninth through the catacombs and\nflank the Kez position. When they try to attack Budwiel, we’ll smash them\nagainst the gates and route them.”\n“That sounds very military.”\n“Mihali, please focus!”\nMihali finally stopped casting about the mess tent as if searching for\ntomorrow’s menu and gave Tamas a level stare. “Kresimir was a\ncommander. Brude was a commander. I am a chef. But since you ask: The\nstrategy sounds very high-risk with an equally high payoff. It suits you\nperfectly.”\n“Can you do anything to help?” Tamas asked gently.\nMihali seemed to think on this. “I can make sure that your men remain\nunnoticed until the moment you charge.”\nTamas felt a wave of relief. “That would be perfect.” He waited for a\nfew moments. “Mihali, you appear agitated.”\nMihali took Tamas by the elbow and pulled him into one corner of the\ntent. In a low voice, he said, “Kresimir is gone.”\n“That’s right,” Tamas said. “Taniel killed him.”\n“No, no. Kresimir is gone, but I didn’t feel him die.”\n“But the whole of the Nine felt it. Privileged Borbador told me that\nevery Knacked and Privileged in the world felt it when he died.”\n“That wasn’t him dying,” Mihali said, waving the lump of bread dough\nstill in one hand. “That was his counterstroke against Taniel for shooting\nhim in the head.”\nTamas’s mouth was suddenly dry. “You mean Kresimir is still alive?”\nPrivileged Borbador had warned Tamas that a god couldn’t be killed. Tamas\nhad hoped that Borbador was wrong.\n“I don’t know,” Mihali said, “and that’s what worries me. I’ve always\nbeen able to sense him, even when half the cosmos separated us.”\n“Is he with the Kez army?” Tamas would have to cancel all his plans."

        "text": "been able to sense him, even when half the cosmos separated us.”\n“Is he with the Kez army?” Tamas would have to cancel all his plans.\nRethink every strategy. If Kresimir was with the Kez army, they might all\nbe swept away.\n“No, he’s not,” Mihali said. “I would know.”\n“But you said that…”\n“I assure you,” Mihali said. “I would know if he was that close. Besides,\nhe wouldn’t risk an open confrontation between us.”\nTamas balled his fists. The uncertainties were the worst part of planning\nfor a battle. It always put him on edge, knowing he couldn’t plan for\neverything, and this was a god-sized uncertainty. He’d have to go forward\nwith his plans and hope that Mihali’s help in concealing the troops would be\nenough.\n“Now,” Mihali said, “if we’re quite through with that, I need help with\ntomorrow’s menu.”\nTamas poked the god in the chest. “You are the chef,” he said. “I am the\ncommander, and I have a battle to plan.”\nHe left the mess hall and was halfway to his command tent when he\ncursed himself for not snagging a bowl of Mihali’s squash soup.\nLess than twenty-four hours after Ricard sent him looking for Taniel Two-\nShot, Adamat found himself sitting back in Ricard’s office near the docks.\nRicard chewed on the end of a rough-cut pencil and stared across at\nAdamat. What little hair he had left stuck up from the top of his head like a\nwind-blown haystack, and Adamat wondered if he’d slept at all in the time\nbetween their meetings. At least he was wearing a different shirt and jacket.\nThe room smelled of incense, burned paper, and foul meat. Adamat\nwondered if there was an uneaten sandwich beneath one of the stacks of\nrecords.\n“You didn’t go home last night, did you?” Adamat asked.\n“How could you tell?”\n“Besides the fact that you look like the pit? You didn’t change your\nboots. I haven’t seen you wear the same pair of boots two days in a row\nsince I met you.”\nRicard looked down at his feet. “You would notice that, wouldn’t you?”\nHe wiped fatigue from his eyes. “Don’t tell me you’ve already found Two-\nShot?”\nAdamat held up a piece of paper. On it, he’d written the address of the\nmala den where he’d found the hero of the Adran army wallowing in his\nown self-pity. He held the note out to Ricard. When Ricard reached for it,\nhe pulled it back at the last second, as if suddenly changing his mind.\n“I read something interesting in the newspaper this morning,” Adamat\nsaid. When Ricard didn’t respond, he took the newspaper in question from\nunder his arm and threw it on the desk. “ ‘Ricard Tumblar to Run for First\nMinister of the Republic of Adro,’ ” he said, reading the headline out loud.\n“Oh,” Ricard said blandly. “That.”\n“Why didn’t you tell me?”\n“You seemed to have a lot on your plate.”\n“And you’re vying to become leader of our new government.

What the\npit are you doing business down at the docks for?”\nRicard perked up. “I’ve built a new place. Moving into it tomorrow,\nactually. Still in the factory district, but it’ll be fantastic for entertaining\ndignitaries. Would you like to see it?”\n“I’m a little busy now,” Adamat said. When Ricard’s face fell, he added,\n“Some other time, I’m sure.”\n“You’ll like it. Gaudy. Grand. But stylish.”\nAdamat snorted. Knowing Ricard, “gaudy” only began to describe it. He\ntossed the paper on Ricard’s desk. “Either you had less people looking for\nhim than you made me believe, or your people are idiots.”\n“I don’t recognize the address,” Ricard said, grinning so hard it made his\ncheeks red.\nAdamat wasn’t in the mood for the enthusiasm. “After a battle, soldiers\ngo straight for one of two things: either home or vice. Taniel Two-Shot is a\ncareer soldier, so I guessed vice. The quickest place to find that near the\nPeople’s Court is to head northwest into the Gurlish Quarter. He was in the\nsixth mala den I checked.”\n“You got lucky,” Ricard said. “Admit it. He could have gone anywhere.\nYou just looked in the Gurlish Quarter first.”\nAdamat shrugged. Investigative work depended more on luck than he\ncared to admit, but he’d never tell that to a client. “Any chance you found\nthe record for the address I gave you yesterday?”\nRicard sifted through the papers on his desk. A moment later he handed\nAdamat back Vetas’s card. It had a name and address written on it in pencil.\n“Fell checked herself,” Ricard said. “The warehouse was bought by a\ntailor—of all things—two years ago. There are no records to indicate it had\nbeen sold after the tailor bought it, which means it didn’t fall into the hands\nof the union. Must have been purchased privately. I’m sorry I couldn’t do\nmore to help.”\n“This is a start,” Adamat said. He stood up and retrieved his hat and\ncane.\n“You’ll be taking SouSmith with you, won’t you?” Ricard asked. “I\ndon’t want you going after this Vetas alone.”\n“SouSmith is still laid up,” Adamat said. “He took some bloody damage\nfrom the Barbers.”\nRicard grimaced. “He could go see Lady Parkeur.”\nLady Parkeur was an eccentric middle-aged woman who lived with\nthousands of birds in an old church in High Talien. She always had feathers\nin her hair and smelled like a henhouse, but she was also the only Knacked\nin the city with the ability to heal wounds. She could knit together broken\ntissue and bone with the force of her will, and she cost more money than a\nPrivileged healer.\n“I spent every penny I had left to get myself healed by her after the\nbeating I took from Charlemund,” Adamat said. “I had to so I could go after\nmy family.”"

Tell her I’m calling in that favor she\nowes me. There’s a boxer, name of SouSmith, who needs mending. Tell her\nshe needs to make a house call today.”\n“She doesn’t do house calls,” Fell said.\n“She bloody well better for me. If she gives you any lip, remind her\nabout that incident with the goat.”\n“Right away,” Fell said.\n“Incident with a goat?” Adamat said.\nRicard looked around. “Don’t ask. I need a bloody drink.”\n“Ricard, you don’t have to call in favors for me,” Adamat said. He knew\nby experience how much Lady Parkeur cost for healing. The wait to see her\nwas usually weeks. Adamat had only gotten in through a personal request\nfrom Field Marshal Tamas.\n“Think nothing of it,” Ricard said. “You’ve saved my ass more times\nthan I can count.” He recovered a bottle from behind a stack of books and\ndrained the last finger of cloudy liquid from the bottle, then made a face. It\nwas another moment before he ceased his search for more alcohol and\ndropped into his seat. “But don’t think I won’t ask you for more favors.\nThis ‘First Minister’ business is going to be a rough time.”\n“I’ll do what I can.”\n“Good. Now go find out about Lord Whatshisname. I’ve been thinking\nof a really big gift for you and Faye for your anniversary next year. I’d\nprefer that you’re both around to give it to.”\nCHAPTER\n6\nT\naniel cut the last silver button off his jacket and handed it to Kin. The\nstooped Gurlish examined the button closely in the light of a candle before\nsliding it into his pocket, just like he had all the others, and set a ball of\nmala on the table next to Taniel’s hammock.\nDespite the greed apparent on Kin’s face, he had a worried look in his\neyes.\n“Don’t go through it so fast. Savor. Taste. Enjoy,” Kin said.\nTaniel pushed a large piece of mala into his pipe. It lit instantly off the\nembers of the old mala, and he breathed in deep.\n“You smoke more in a day than any man does in twenty,” Kin said. He\nsettled back on his haunches, watching Taniel smoke.\nTaniel lifted his silver powder-mage button and rolled it between his\nfingers. “Must be the sorcery,” he said. “Ever had a powder mage in here\nbefore?”\nKin shook his head.\n“Never known a powder mage who smoked mala myself,” Taniel said.\n“We all take the powder. Never need more to feel alive.”\n“Why the mala?” Kin busied himself sweeping the center of the den.\nTaniel took a deep breath. “Powder doesn’t make you forget.”\n“Ah. Forget. Every man takes mala to forget.” Kin nodded knowingly."

I work through the\nnight. Most smokers come then.”\n“Give me enough for that, then.”\nKin seemed to consider this, looking at the ball he just gave Taniel.\nFrom what he said, a ball like that should have lasted four or five days.\n“Give me the powder keg, and I’ll give you as much you can smoke for\nthree weeks.”\nTaniel clenched the powder-keg pin in his fist. “No. What else?”\n“I’ll give you my daughter for the whole three weeks, too.”\nTaniel’s stomach turned at the thought of the Gurlish mala man pimping\nhis daughter to his customers.\n“No.”\n“You like art?” Kin picked up the sketchbook and pencil Ka-poel had\nbrought for Taniel.\n“Put those down.”\nKin dropped the sketchbook with a sigh. “You no have value. No\nmoney.”\nTaniel checked the pockets of his coat. Nothing. He ran his fingers over\nthe silver embroidery.\n“How much for my coat?”\nKin sniffed and touched the fabric. “Tiny bit.”\n“Give me that.” Taniel set his mala pipe on the table and wriggled out of\nthe coat, handing it over to Kin.\n“You’ll die of cold, and I won’t pay for funeral.”\n“It’s the middle of summer. Give me the damned mala.”\nKin handed him a disappointingly small ball of the sticky black mala\nbefore disappearing up the stairs with Taniel’s coat. Taniel heard the creak\nof feet on the floorboards above him, and Kin’s voice speaking in Gurlish.\nHe settled back into his hammock and took a long draw at his mala pipe.\nIt was said that mala would make a man forget for hours at a time.\nTaniel tried to think back on the hours he’d lost. How long had he been\ndown here? Days? Weeks? It didn’t seem like a long time.\nHe took the pipe out of his mouth and examined it in the dim light of the\nden’s candles. “Damned stuff doesn’t work,” he said to himself. He could\nstill see Kresimir stepping out of that cloud after descending from the sky.\nA god! A real, live god. Taniel wondered what his childhood priest would\nhave done had he known Taniel would one day grow up to shoot the god of\nthe Nine.\nTime hadn’t stopped when the ensorcelled bullet went through\nKresimir’s eye, so it seemed the world could live without its god.

Maybe it was the mala, but, by the pit, it made\nhis heart beat faster when he saw the savage girl’s face.\nThe steps creaked. Taniel looked up.

Damn.\nFirst thing she noticed.\nHe wrapped his hand around his ball of mala protectively.\nQuicker than he could see, her hand darted forward and snatched the\nmala pipe from between his teeth.\n“You little bitch,” he hissed. “Give it back.”\nShe danced away from his grasping hands to stand in the middle of the\nroom, grinning.\n“Ka-poel, bring me that pipe.”\nShe shook her head.\nHis breathing came harder. He blinked against a sudden cloud in his\nvision, unable to tell if it was the mala or his own fury. After a moment of\nstruggle, he sat up in the hammock.\n“Give it back to me now.” He swung his legs over the edge of the\nhammock, but when he tried to stand up, a wave of nausea struck him\nharder than it ever had when he opened his third eye to see into the Else. He\nsank back into the hammock, his heart hammering in his ears.\n“Pit,” he whispered, clutching at his temples. “I’m all sorts of\nbuggered.”\nKa-poel set the mala pipe on a stool on the other side of the room.\n“Don’t put that there,” Taniel said, his own voice now weak. “Bring it to\nme.”\nShe just shook her head and shrugged out of her duster. Before he could\nprotest, she crossed to him and swept it up over his hammock and up to his\nshoulders.\nHe pushed it away. “You’ll get cold,” he said.\nShe pointed at him.\n“It’s summer, damn it. I’m fine.”\nShe drew the duster back up over his chest.\nAgain, he gave it back to her. “I’m not a child.”\nSomething seemed to light in her eyes at that. She pulled the duster off\nhim and threw it to the ground.\n“Pole, what the…” His next words were lost in his own strangled cry as\nshe lifted one leg over the hammock and straddled him, sitting directly on\nhis lap. His heart beat a little faster as she wiggled her ass to get\ncomfortable. In the closeness of the niche, their faces were almost touching.\n“Pole…,” he said, suddenly breathless.

Feet thumped on the floorboards. A woman began\nshouting in Gurlish.\nKa-poel lowered her head. Taniel’s shoulders flexed, pushing him\ntoward her.\n“Captain Taniel Two-Shot!” The stairs rattled under a pair of determined\nboots. A woman in a dress suit, hat in hand, entered the room. “Captain!”\nshe said. “Captain, I…”\nShe froze when she saw Taniel with Ka-poel in his lap. Taniel felt the\ncolor rise in his cheeks. A quick glance at Ka-poel. She gave him a small,\nknowing smile, but annoyance flashed in her eyes. She rolled off of him and\nswept her duster off the floor and over her shoulders in one quick\nmovement.\nThe woman turned to one side, staring at the far wall. “Sir, I’m sorry, I\ndidn’t know you were indisposed.”\n“She’s not undressed,” Taniel retorted. His voice cracked and he cleared\nhis throat. “Who the pit are you?”\nThe woman gave a slight bow. “I am Fell Baker, undersecretary for the\nHoly Warriors of Labor.” Despite having found them in a compromising\nsituation, she didn’t seem the least bit embarrassed.\n“The union? How the pit did you find me?” Taniel pulled himself to a\nsitting position in the hammock, though it made his stomach turn something\nfierce. He wondered how long it had been since he ate.\n“I’m Ricard Tumblar’s aide, sir. He sent me to find you. He would very\nmuch like to meet with you.”\n“Tumblar? Don’t know the name.” He settled back into the hammock\nand eyed Ka-poel. She’d sat on the stool on the far side of the mala den,\ntapping his pipe against her palm as she studied the undersecretary.\nFell raised an eyebrow. “He’s the head of the union, sir.”\n“I don’t care.”\n“He’s asked me to extend to you an invitation to lunch.”\n“Go away.”\n“He says there’s a great deal of money at stake.”\n“I don’t care.”\nFell examined him for a few moments before turning and heading up the\ncreaking stairs just as abruptly as she’d arrived. The hushed sound of voices\ncame down through the floor. They were speaking in Gurlish. Taniel\nglanced at Ka-poel. She returned his stare for a moment, then winked.\nWhat the pit?\nA few moments later the undersecretary came back downstairs.\n“Sir, it appears you’re out of money.”\nTaniel looked for his mala pipe. Oh. Ka-poel still had it. Right.\n“Take that from her and give it to me, would you?” Taniel said to Fell.\nFell faced Ka-poel. The two women exchanged a glance that seemed full\nof meaning. Taniel didn’t like that at all.\nThe undersecretary clasped her hands together. “I will not, sir.” She\ncrossed the room in two strides and grabbed Taniel by the chin, forcing his\nface toward her.

She examined his eyes.\n“Let go of me, or I will bloody well kill you,” Taniel growled.\nFell took her hands away and stepped back. “How much have you\nsmoked since you got here?”\n“Don’t know,” Tamas grumbled. Ka-poel hadn’t so much as moved\nwhen the undersecretary had rushed him. Some help she was.\n“Eight pounds of the stuff in four days. That’s what the owner told me.”\nTaniel shrugged.\n“That’s enough to kill a warhorse, sir.”\nTaniel sniffed. “Didn’t seem to do much.”\nA perplexed look crossed Fell’s face. She opened her mouth, shut it\nagain, and then said, “Didn’t do much? I…” She grasped her hat and went\nback upstairs, only to return again after a few minutes.\n“The owner,” Fell said, “insists he watched you smoke it himself. I\nexamined your eyes. Not even a hint of mala poisoning. Pit, I’ve probably\ngotten mala poisoning just standing in the smoke and talking to you. You’re\ngod-touched.”\nTaniel surged to his feet. One moment he was in the hammock, and the\nnext he had Fell by the lapels with both fists. His head spun, his vision\nwarped, and his hands trembled with rage. “I am not god-touched,” Taniel\nsaid. “I’ve not… I’m…”\n“Kindly unhand me, sir,” Fell said gently.\nTaniel felt his hands drop to his sides. He took a step back and mumbled\nto himself.\n“I’ll give you a moment to clean up,” Fell said. “We’ll get you a new\njacket on the way to see Ricard.”\n“I’m not going,” Taniel said weakly. He stumbled to the corner, grateful\nfor a wall to lean against. It might be that he couldn’t go. He doubted he\ncould walk more than twenty feet.\nFell sighed. “Mr. Tumblar offers the hospitality of his own mala den, sir.\nIt is a much more comfortable location, and his den-keeper won’t take your\njacket. If you refuse that invitation, we are instructed to bring you there by\nforce.”\nTaniel looked over to Ka-poel. She was cleaning her fingernails with\nwhat looked to be a sharpened knitting needle, almost as long as her\nforearm. She met his eyes briefly. Again that small, knowing smile. Again\nthe annoyance in her eyes.\n“Ricard’s den has significantly more privacy than this, sir,” Fell said,\ncoughing once into her hand.\nTaniel was not sure that whatever had just happened with Ka-poel was\nbound to repeat itself. “All right, Fell. But one thing.”\n“Sir?”\n“I don’t think I’ve eaten in two days. I could use some lunch.”\nTwo hours later, Taniel was in the Adopest docks.

        "text": "ran Adran commerce, governing the transport of cargo from the Ad River\nand its tributaries in the north all the way down through Surkov’s Alley and\nacross the Amber Expanse. With the war on, trade through Kez was at a\nstandstill, and cargo that usually used the river was now sent over the\nmountains by mule and packhorse.\nDespite the change in transportation, the docks were still the center of\ncommerce in Adopest. Barges brought iron ore and raw lumber down the\nriver to supply the Adran mills and gunsmiths, who turned out weapons and\nammunition in the hundreds every day.\nThe docks stank of fish, sewage, and smoke, and Taniel was starting to\nmiss the cool, sweet smell of mala in Kin’s den. His escort consisted of Fell\nBaker the undersecretary and a pair of wide-shouldered steelworkers. Taniel\nwondered if the steelworkers were there to carry him to the meeting with\nRicard if he decided not to go.\nKa-poel trailed along behind the group. The steelworkers ignored her;\nFell kept a wary eye on her at all times. She seemed to suspect that Ka-poel\nwas more than just a mute savage, while Taniel had a hunch that Fell might\nbe more than an undersecretary.\nFell stopped in front of a dockside warehouse within spitting distance of\nthe water. Taniel looked out from between the alleyways and across the\nAdsea. Even during the day he could see a glow on the horizon, and the\nconspicuous absence of South Pike Mountain. The view made him want to\nhide beneath a rock. The death throes of a god had leveled a mountain, and\nhe’d gotten away with a month-long coma. He wasn’t certain why he wasn’t\ndead, but he suspected it had to do with Ka-poel.\nHe wondered if everyone else had been so lucky. Where was Bo? Where\nwere the men and women of the Mountainwatch he’d befriended during the\ndefense of Shouldercrown?\nAn image flashed through his mind of clutching Ka-poel to his chest as\nKresimir’s palace collapsed around him. Fire and stone, the burning heat of\nlava as the mountain collapsed.\n“Hard to believe it’s gone, isn’t it,” Fell said, nodding across the water\nas she opened the door to the warehouse and gestured for Taniel to go in.\nTaniel gave one last glance to the east and jerked his head toward Fell.\n“You first.”\n“Fine,” Fell said. She looked to the steelworkers, offering them cigars\nfrom a gunmetal case in her vest pocket. “Back to work for you, boys.” The\ntwo men tipped their hats to Fell, took a light for their cigars and then\nheaded back into the street. “Come on,” Fell said. Once they were all in, she\nclosed the door behind Ka-poel. “Welcome to Ricard’s new offices.”\nTaniel had to keep himself from whistling. On the outside, the building\nlooked like an old warehouse. The windows were shuttered, the brick long\nin need of refacing. The inside was another matter.\nThe floors were of black marble, and the walls were whitewashed\nbehind crimson satin curtains. The building appeared to have but one main\nroom, an echoing chamber two stories high and at least two hundred paces"

        "text": "The floors were of black marble, and the walls were whitewashed\nbehind crimson satin curtains. The building appeared to have but one main\nroom, an echoing chamber two stories high and at least two hundred paces\nlong, lit by a half-dozen crystal chandeliers. At the near end of the room\nthere was a long bar, complete with uniformed barman and well-endowed\nwoman in nothing more than a petticoat.\n“Your coat, sir,” the woman said.\nTaniel handed her his new dark-blue uniform jacket. He felt his gaze rest\non her a little longer than was proper. Without looking at Ka-poel, he turned\nto examine the room. Artwork adorned the walls, sculptures were set at\neven intervals inside shallow recesses. This was the kind of wealth\ndisplayed by the highest echelons of nobility, even that of the king. Taniel\nthought that Tamas had stamped out this kind of wealth when he\nslaughtered the nobility. A thought occurred that perhaps Tamas had just\nchanged the very rich and powerful for a new set of the same.\nA man crossed the marble floor toward them. He wore a white smoking\njacket, a cigar clenched between his teeth. He looked to be about forty years\nold, with a hairline receding well past the middle of his head. He wore a\nlong beard in the Fatrastan style, and the grin on his face reached his ears\nand even touched his eyes.\n“Taniel Two-Shot,” the man said, holding out his hand. “Ricard\nTumblar. I’m a great admirer of yours.”\nTaniel took his hand with hesitation.\n“Mr. Tumblar.”\n“Mister? Bah, call me Ricard. I’m at your service. And this must be your\never-present companion. The Dynize. My lady?” Ricard swept into a deep\nbow and took Ka-poel’s hand in his, bending to kiss it gently. Despite his\nforward nature, he eyed her as one might something pretty but far from\ntame, something that might bite at any moment.\nKa-poel didn’t seem to know how to react to this.\n“I’d heard you were a handsome woman,” Ricard said, “but the stories\ndidn’t do you justice.” He broke away from them and crossed to the bar.\n“Drink?”\n“What do you have?” Taniel felt his mood brighten a little.\n“Anything,” Ricard said.\nTaniel doubted that. “Fatrastan ale, then.”\nRicard nodded to the barman. “Two, please. For the lady?”\nKa-poel flashed three fingers.\n“Make that three,” Ricard said to the barman. A moment later, he\nhanded Taniel a mug.\n“Son of a bitch,” Taniel said after a sip. “You really do have Fatrastan\nale.”\n“I did say anything. Can we take a seat?”\nHe led them toward the far end of the room. Taniel blamed his mala-\naddled mind for not noticing earlier that they weren’t alone. A dozen men\nand half again as many women lounged on divans, drinking and smoking,\ntalking quietly among themselves.\nRicard spoke as they approached the group. “Oh, I had a question for\nyou, Taniel. How much black powder does the army use?”"

How much black powder does the army use?”\nTaniel rubbed his eyes. His head hurt, and he didn’t come here to meet\nRicard’s cronies. “Quite a lot, I’d imagine. I’m not a quartermaster. Why do\nyou ask?”\n“Been getting more and more powder orders from the General Staff,”\nRicard said, waving his hand like it was a trifle. “I just thought it strange. It\nalmost seems as if their requisitions double every week. Nothing to worry\nabout, I’m sure.”\nThe talking died down when Taniel reached the group at the end of the\nroom, and he felt suddenly uncomfortable.\n“I thought this was going to be a private meeting,” Taniel said quietly,\nstopping Ricard with a hand to his arm.\nRicard didn’t even glance down at the hand Taniel laid on him. “Give\nme a moment to make introductions and we’ll get down to business.”\nHe went around the room, giving names that Taniel immediately forgot,\nand titles that Taniel took no great note of. These men and women were the\nheads of the various factions within the unions: bakers, steelworkers,\nmillers, ironsmiths, blacksmiths, and goldsmiths.\nTrue to his word, when the introductions were finished, Ricard led them\ntoward a quiet corner of the vast room, where they were joined by just one\nother woman. She was one of the first Ricard had introduced, and Taniel\ncouldn’t remember her name.\n“Cigarette?” Ricard offered as they took their seats. A man in a jacket\nmatching the barman’s brought them a silver tray lined with cigarettes,\ncigars, and pipes. Taniel noticed a mala pipe among the recreation. His\nfingers twitched to take it, but he fought down the urge and waved away the\nservant.\n“Your secretary said you wanted to meet with me,” Taniel said, realizing\nwith a start that Fell had disappeared. “She didn’t say why. I’d like to\nknow.”\n“I have a proposition.”\nTaniel looked at the woman again. She was older, with an air of disdain\nparticular to the very wealthy. What was her name? And who did she\nrepresent? The bakers? No. Goldsmiths?\n“I’m not interested,” Taniel said.\n“I haven’t even told you what it is,” Ricard said.\n“Look,” Taniel said. “I came because your undersecretary made it clear\nthat she’d make me come even if I didn’t want to. I’ve been polite. I’ve\ncome. Now I’d like to go.” He stood.\n“Is this what you brought me here for, Ricard?” the woman said, looking\ndown her nose at Taniel. “To see a mala-drunk soldier piss on your\nhospitality? I fear for this country, Ricard. We’ve handed it over to the\nuneducated soldiers. They don’t know anything but vice and killing.”\nTaniel clenched his fists and felt his lip curl. “You don’t know me,\nmadam. You don’t know who the pit I am or what I’ve seen. Don’t pretend\nto understand soldiers when you’ve never looked into another man’s eyes"

Don’t pretend\nto understand soldiers when you’ve never looked into another man’s eyes\nand seen that one of you would die.”\nRicard leaned back on his divan and relit his cigar with a matchstick. He\nhad the air of a man at the boxing ring. Had he expected this?\nThe woman fairly bristled. “I know soldiers,” she said. “Sick, stupid\nbrutes. You rape and steal, and you kill when you can’t do that. I’ve known\nmany soldiers and I don’t have to kill a man to know you’re nothing more\nthan a churlish brigand in a uniform.”\nRicard sighed. “Please, Cheris, not now.”\n“Not now?” Cheris asked. “If not now, then when? I’ve had enough of\nTamas’s iron grip on the city. I didn’t want you to bring this so-called war\nhero here.”\nTaniel turned to go.\n“Taniel,” Ricard said. “Give me just a few more moments.”\n“Not with her here,” Taniel said. He headed toward the door, only to find\nhis way blocked by Ka-poel. “I’m leaving, Pole.”\nShe returned his grimace with a cool-eyed shake of the head.\n“Look at that!” Cheris said behind him. “The coward flees back to his\nmala den. He can’t face truth. And you want this man at your side, Ricard?\nHe’s led around by a savage girl.”\nTaniel whirled. He’d had enough. His rage piqued, he advanced toward\nCheris, one hand held in the air.\n“Strike me!” she said, leaning forward to offer a cheek. “It’ll show how\nmuch of a man you are.”\nTaniel froze. Had he just been ready to hit her? “I killed a god,” he\nfumed. “I put a bullet through his eye and watched him die to save this\ncountry!”\n“Lies,” Cheris said. “You lie to me to my face? You think I believe this\ntripe about Kresimir returning?”\nTaniel would have let his hand fly right then if Ka-poel hadn’t slipped\naround him. She faced Cheris, eyes narrowed. Taniel suddenly felt fear. As\nmuch as he wanted to hurt this woman, he knew what Ka-poel was capable\nof.\n“Pole,” he said.\n“Out of my face, you savage whore,” Cheris said, getting to her feet.\nKa-poel’s fist connected with her nose hard enough to send Cheris\ntumbling over the back of the divan. Cheris screamed. Ricard shot to his\nfeet. The group of union bosses still speaking quietly on the other side of\nthe room fell silent, and stared, shocked, toward them.\nCheris climbed to her feet, pushing away Ricard’s attempt to help.\nWithout a look back, she fled the room, blood streaming from her nose.\nRicard turned to Taniel, his expression caught somewhere between\nhorror and amusement.\n“I won’t apologize,” Taniel said. “Neither for me nor for Pole.” Ka-poel\ntook a place at his side, arms crossed.\n“She was my guest,” Ricard said. He paused, examined his cigar. “More"

She’s going\nto make me pay for that later. I’d hoped she would be an ally in the coming\nmonths, but it appears that is not the case.”\nTaniel looked to Ricard, then to the main door, where Cheris was\ndemanding her coachman.\n“I should go,” Taniel said.\n“No, no. Ale!” Ricard shouted again, though Taniel could see the\nbarkeep heading toward them. “You’re more important than she is.”\nTaniel slowly lowered himself back into his seat. “I killed Kresimir,” he\nsaid. Part of him wanted to be proud of it, but saying it aloud made him feel\nill.\n“That’s what Tamas told me,” Ricard said.\n“You don’t believe me.”\nThe barkeep arrived and changed Taniel’s mug for another one, though\nhe’d only finished half. New mugs all around and the man disappeared.\nRicard drank deeply of his before he began to speak.\n“I’m a practical man,” Ricard said. “I know that sorcery exists, though I\nam not a Privileged or a Knacked or a Marked. Two months ago, if you’d\ntold me that Kresimir would return, I would have wondered what asylum\nyou’d escaped from.\n“But I was there when the Barbers tried to kill Mihali. I saw your father\n—a man twice as pragmatic as I—go ghost white. He felt something from\nthe chef and—”\n“I’m sorry,” Taniel interrupted. “Mihali?”\nRicard tapped the ash from the end of his cigar. “Oh. You’re very much\nout of the loop, aren’t you? Mihali is Adom reborn. Kresimir’s brother, here\nin the flesh.”\nTaniel felt the hair on the back of his neck stand on end. Another god?\nKresimir’s own brother?\n“What I’m trying to get at,” Ricard went on, “is that your father believes\nthat Mihali is Adom reborn. And if Adom has returned, why not Kresimir?\nSo, yes. I believe you shot Kresimir. Is it possible to kill a god? I don’t\nknow.”\nHe scowled into his mug. “As for the newspapers and the people, they\nare skeptical. Rumors fly. People are taking sides. Right now it all comes\ndown to a matter of faith, and we have only your word and the word of a\nfew Mountainwatchers that Kresimir returned and took a bullet in the eye.”\nTaniel felt his strength leave him. To be thought a fraud after all he went\nthrough? It was the final blow. He pointed to the door. “How do they\nexplain South Pike? The entire mountain collapsed.” He heard his voice rise\nwith anger.\n“You won’t change anyone’s mind by shouting,” Ricard said. “Believe\nme. I’m the head of the union. I’ve tried.”\n“Then what can I do?”\n“Convince them. Show them what kind of a man you are and then, only\nwhen they trust you, tell them the truth.”\n“That seems… dishonest.”"

Show them what kind of a man you are and then, only\nwhen they trust you, tell them the truth.”\n“That seems… dishonest.”\nRicard spread his hands. “That’s up to your own moral judgment. But\nme, I think a man who sees it like that is a fool.”\nTaniel clenched his fists. How could they not believe him? How could\nthey not know what happened up there? Hadn’t Tamas told the newspapers?\nDid even Tamas not believe what had happened? Taniel didn’t know where\nTamas was. Budwiel, according to the soldiers who had been watching him\nwhen he awoke. Was Tamas even still there?\n“Do you know where Bo is?” Taniel asked.\n“Bo?”\n“Privileged Borbador. Is he still alive?”\nRicard spread his hands. “I can’t help you.”\n“You’re not much good, Tumblar, are you?” Taniel wanted to punch\nsomething. He leapt to his feet and stalked back and forth the length of the\nroom. No friends. No family. What could he do now? “Who was that\nwoman?” he asked.\n“Cheris? The head of the bankers’ union.”\n“I thought you were the head of the union.”\n“The Noble Warriors of Labor has many subdivisions. I speak for the\ngroup as a whole, but each trade has their own union boss.”\n“You said I was more important than her.”\nRicard nodded. “I did.”\n“How so?”\n“How much do you know about politics in Adro?” Ricard countered\nwith his own question.\n“The power used to be with the king. Now?” Taniel shrugged. “No\nidea.”\n“No one knows where the power is now,” Ricard said. “The people\nassume it’s with Tamas. Tamas thinks it’s with his council when in fact the\ncouncil is all but fractured. Lady Winceslav is in seclusion after her scandal\nwith a traitorous brigadier, the Arch Diocel has been arrested, and Prime\nLektor is in the east, studying the remains of South Pike for some sign of\nthe god Kresimir.”\n“So who is running Adro?”\nRicard chuckled. “That leaves myself, the Proprietor, and Ondraus the\nReeve. Not exactly a noble group. The truth is, Adro is doing fine for now.\nTamas and his men keep the peace. But that will only last so long. We need\nto continue with our plans. Since the beginning of all this, the council\ndecided that as soon as Manhouch was out of the way, we’d set up a\ndemocracy: a system of government that was voted upon by the people. The\ncountry would be divided into principalities, each with its own elected\ngovernor, and those men would meet in Adro and vote upon policy for the\ncountry.”\n“Much like a ministry without the king at the head.”\n“Indeed,” Ricard said. “Of course there must be someone to stand as the\nking.”\nTaniel narrowed his eyes. “I can’t imagine Tamas taking that well.”\n“We won’t call him a king, of course. And he would have little real\npower. He would serve as a figurehead. A single man the country can look"

A single man the country can look\nto for leadership and guidance, even if the policy is determined by the\ngovernors—we are going to call him the First Minister of the People.”\n“I remember Tamas striking down an idea just like this that the royalists\npresented him with.”\n“Tamas approved this,” Ricard said. “Believe me. None of us on the\ncouncil has any interest in crossing him, especially not in such a public way.\nThe key is that, like the governors, this new First Minister of the People will\nbe replaced every three years. We’ve set the mechanism in place. It just\nneeds to be carried out.”\nTaniel could easily tell where this was going. “And you intend to put\nyourself forward as a candidate.”\n“Of course.”\n“Why?”\nRicard sucked hard on his cigar and let the smoke curl out through his\nnostrils. It reminded Taniel of the smoke of his mala pipe. He could feel the\nlure of that blissful smoke pulling at him.\n“The First Minister of the People will have little power of his own, but\nhe’ll have the eyes of all the Nine directed at him. His name will go down\nin the history books forever.” Ricard sighed. “I don’t have any children.\nI’ve been left by”—he stopped to count—“six wives, and deserved it every\ntime. All I have left is my name. And I want it taught to every Adran\nschoolchild for the rest of time.”\nTaniel drained the last of his ale. The dregs of the hops at the bottom of\nthe glass were bitter. It reminded him of Fatrasta, of hunting down Kez\nPrivileged in the wilds. “Where do I fit into all of this? I’m just a soldier\nwho killed a god that no one believes even returned.”\n“You?” Ricard threw his head back and laughed. Taniel didn’t see what\nwas so funny.\n“I’m sorry,” Ricard said as he wiped his eyes. “You’re Taniel Two-Shot!\nYou’re the hero of two continents. A soldier who’s killed more Privileged\nthan any man in the history of the Nine. The way the newspapers tell it, you\nheld Shouldercrown Fortress against half a million Kez all by yourself.”\n“Wasn’t just me,” Taniel muttered, thinking of the men and women he’d\nwatched die on that mountain.\n“But the common people think so. They adore you. They love you more\nthan they love Tamas, and he’s been the darling of Adro since he single-\nhandedly saved the Gurlish Campaign decades ago.”\n“So what do you want from me? A sponsorship?”\n“Pit, no,” Ricard said, passing his empty ale mug to the barkeep. “I want\nyou to be my Second Minister. You’ll be one of the most famous men in the\nworld.”\nCHAPTER\n7\nI\nn northeastern Adopest there was a small section of the Samalian District\nthat hadn’t been burned when Field Marshal Tamas allowed the pillage of\nthe nobility’s property after Manhouch’s execution.

Rumor\nhad it that during the riots the owners of these shops set up their own\nbarricades and held off the rioters themselves.\nNow, five months after the riots, the former emporium of the rich had\nbeen transformed into a marketplace for the middle class. Prices had been\nlowered, but not quality, and people traveled halfway across the city to wait\nin line for cobblers, tailors, bakers, and jewelers.\nAdamat came early in the morning, before the larger crowds arrived, and\nfound the tailor who had purchased Vetas’s warehouse. Adamat sat down in\na small café across the street from the tailor’s and ordered breakfast,\nkeeping an eye out for expected company. It wasn’t long until he spotted it.\nAdamat rose from his seat and crossed the street. He discreetly sidled up\nbeside SouSmith and said, “Were you followed?”\nTo his credit, SouSmith barely started. “Bloody pit,” SouSmith said.\n“Didn’t recognize ya.”\n“That’s the idea.” Adamat had dyed his hair gray. A dry dusting of\npowder on his face made his skin appear cracked, making him look twenty\nyears older, and he affected a limp. He leaned heavily on a new, silver-\nheaded cane. His jacket and pants were the finest money could by—he’d\nhad to call in favors just to procure them. But he needed to look the part of a\nwealthy gentleman.\nSouSmith shook his head. “Wasn’t followed,” he said. “Been staying\nlow.”\n“Good,” Adamat said. “How do you feel?”\n“Like pit. Bloody healing Knacked.”\nDespite what he said, SouSmith looked better. Just five weeks ago he’d\nbeen shot twice and stabbed, and had barely made it through alive. It would\nhave been a long recovery without Ricard’s largesse.\n“Go to that café over there,” Adamat said, “and get breakfast. Take a\nseat facing that store there.” He indicated the tailor’s shop. “I’m going in to\nmake some inquiries.”\nAs much as he wanted SouSmith to come inside the tailor shop with him\nin case it was merely a front for Vetas and Vetas had men stationed inside,\nSouSmith was too memorable of a man, and there was no disguising a\nboxer of his size. No sense in bringing him in until needed.\nAdamat crossed the street and entered the shop. A quick perusal told\nhim that this tailor specialized in high-end jackets. Mannequins were placed\naround the edges of the room, wearing everything from smoking and\nevening jackets to the kind a duke might wear to a ball. The shop smelled\nstrongly of peppermint oil that the owner used to mask the scent of stored\ncloth.\n“May I help you?”\nThe tailor came in from the back room. He was a dark-skinned Deliv; a\nsmall man with long, steady fingers. He wore a pair of thin-rimmed\nspectacles and a vest with protruding lapels stuck through with a variety of\nneedles and pins.\n“Haime?” Adamat said, affecting an accent common in Adopest’s\nsouthern suburbs."

May I take\nyour measurements for a new jacket today?”\n“I haven’t come in search of clothing,” Adamat said. He looked down\nthe end of his nose and made a show of perusing the mannequins. “At least,\nnot today.”\nHaime clasped his hands behind his back. “Some other business?”\nAdamat pulled a piece of paper from his breast pocket and unfolded it.\n“My employers are looking to purchase a piece of property,” he said.\n“Records show that you are the owner.”\nHaime seemed genuinely puzzled. “I don’t own any property.”\n“You did not buy a warehouse on Donavi Street in the factory district\ntwo years ago?”\n“No, I…” Haime suddenly stopped and tapped his chin with one finger.\n“I did. That’s right. One of my clients asked me to make a purchase and\nthen transfer the title into his name. He wanted to keep the affair quiet.\nSomething about not wanting the newspapers getting wind of his\nemployer’s purchases.”\nAdamat felt his heart jump. There were very few organizations that\ncould make the news with a simple purchase of property. One of them was\nthe Brudania-Gurla Trading Company. And their head was Lord\nClaremonte, Vetas’s employer.\n“Could I get his name, please?” Adamat said. He pulled a fountain pen\nfrom his pocket and poised it above his piece of paper.\nHaime gave him an apologetic look. “I’m very sorry, but my client\nrequested I keep that information in confidence.”\n“My employer would very much like to purchase that building,” Adamat\nsaid. “I’m sure that something could be arranged…” He removed a\ncheckbook from his pocket.\n“No, no,” Haime said. “I’m sorry, it’s not a matter of money. I’m a man\nof my word.”\nAdamat gave a long-suffering sigh. “I’m sure.” He put away the\ncheckbook and pen and gathered his hat and cane. He paused, making a\nshow of looking around the mannequins once more with an admiring eye.\nHis gaze stopped on one and he almost choked.\nIt was the same jacket Lord Vetas had been wearing the last time they\nspoke.\n“I see you’ve a fine eye,” Haime said, slipping over toward the\nmannequin. “This jacket is discerning and subtle. It would look fantastic on\nyou.”\nAdamat felt his heart begin to beat faster. Vetas must have been the same\nclient to purchase that warehouse and the jacket. If Haime knew that he\nknew, the tailor might become suspicious.\n“No, I don’t think it’s my style.”\n“Nonsense,” Haime said. “The jacket has a slimming effect and draws\nthe eyes up to your face. I could make an entire suit to match.”\nAdamat pretended to think on this for several moments. The jacket was\nobviously tailored.

He could see a slight discoloration at the waist, where a\nrip had been patched, and he realized that this might be the actual jacket\nLord Vetas had been wearing. “This looks like the right size. Can you tailor\nit for me now?”\n“Unfortunately, no. This particular jacket belongs to someone. He’s\npicking it up in a few days. I could have a new one made up for you in…”\nHe paused to think. “A week. Just let me take your measurements.”\nAdamat patted his pockets. “I seem to have left my own checks at home.\nI only have my employers’. I will not be able to make a payment today.”\n“You’re obviously a gentleman, sir,” Haime said. “You may just give me\nyour address.”\nAdamat didn’t have an address to give to him. He didn’t want to risk any\nword of this reaching Vetas. That risk was already high, as Haime might\nmention the attempted purchase to Vetas just as a matter of course. Adamat\nwithdrew his pocket watch. “I have an appointment in less than an hour,” he\nsaid. “I must make it. Let me come back early next week for\nmeasurements.”\nHaime’s face fell. A good salesman never let a mark go out the door\nwithout a commitment to buy. “If that works best for you.”\n“It does,” Adamat said. “I’ll be back, don’t worry.”\nAdamat hurried across the street and found SouSmith waiting at the\ncafé.\n“Any sign of Vetas or any of his eyes?”\nSouSmith shook his head.\n“Let’s go,” Adamat said.\n“Breakfast still coming.”\nAdamat checked to make sure the tailor wasn’t watching him through\nthe window of his shop before taking a seat next to SouSmith. “The tailor\nisn’t involved directly,” Adamat said. “He bought and sold the property for\none of his clients: I think it’s Vetas. I saw the same jacket Vetas was\nwearing the last time I saw him, all the way down to the tailoring.”\n“You sure?”\n“I don’t forget, remember?” Adamat tapped the side of his head. “I\ncould tell that the lines of that jacket matched perfectly. Unfortunately, the\ntailor wouldn’t give me Vetas’s name or address.”\n“Dead end.”\n“No. Vetas—or, more likely, one of his men—is coming to pick up that\njacket in the next few days. It was being mended. I’m going to stake out the\ntailor and watch for who picks up the jacket. I’ll follow them and find out\nwhere Vetas lives.”\n“Where you want me?” SouSmith’s breakfast arrived: four poached eggs\nwith Novi goat cheese. He grinned as it was set in front of him and set\nabout eating quickly.\n“Nowhere,” Adamat said. “I can’t risk you being recognized. I can wear\na disguise. You, however, can’t.”\nSouSmith sniffed. Through a mouthful of egg, he said, “Can’t leave you\nto follow him alone.”\nAdamat knew the risks. If Vetas or his man was good enough to mark\nAdamat, he could very well be a dead man.

But SouSmith was a liability in\nthis kind of work. He was easily recognized, and even if he wasn’t, his size\nmade him less than ideal for following someone.\n“I’ll do it alone,” Adamat said.\nTamas lay in the tall grass of a knoll beneath the Adran Mountains and\nwatched through his looking glass as the Kez army prepared to assault\nBudwiel.\nMorning dew soaked his combat uniform. The cloud cover was low on\nthis day and a rolling fog clung to plains outside of Budwiel. The air was\nheavy with moisture. He knew it would foul guns on both sides, but when\nTamas looked toward Budwiel, he noted a ray of sunshine peeking through\nthe clouds to bathe the city and clear the air.\nNo doubt Mihali’s indirect participation in the battle.\nAnd they would need every bit of his help. Tamas swung his looking\nglass back toward the Kez. His breath caught in his throat at the sight of\ntheir army. Rank upon rank of tan uniforms with green trim stretched for\nwhat seemed like forever. Long experience let him count their ranks with\nonly a cursory glance.\nOne hundred and twenty thousand at least. And that was just their\ninfantry.\nThey would send their recruits first to act as so much cannon fodder in\norder to test Budwiel’s defenses. Five, maybe ten thousand of them would\npour out across the fields, tramping down the wet grass and receiving the\nfull brunt of grapeshot. They’d be followed quickly by the more\nexperienced men, who’d form a strong backbone to the main assault and\npush the recruits on hard in front of them, even at the tip of their bayonets.\nSorcery-warped Wardens would accompany the front of the second wave.\nIt was a foolish method of attack, in Tamas’s opinion, but the Kez\ncommanders had always favored a massed rush—no matter the cost in lives\n—above guile.\nAnd it just might work. The key to throwing back the Kez assault would\nbe to break the resolve of their second wave. To kill the Wardens and send\nthe veterans running for cover. It would be hard to break such a sizable\nforce.\nBut not impossible.\nWhich is where the Seventh and the Ninth came in. Once the Kez\ncommitted the main body, Tamas would order his men over the knoll at a\ndead charge into the Kez flank.\nNo matter the size of a crowd, they’d run if panic seized them.\nThe Kez cannon had been moved forward before dawn. They pounded\naway at Budwiel’s fortifications, answered in turn by Hilanska’s heavy\nartillery.\nTamas watched as the Kez infantry fell into rank a few hundred yards\nbehind their artillery. He felt his stomach lurch.\n“That’s a lot of men, sir,” Olem said from beside him.\n“A great many,” Tamas agreed. Was that unease in Olem’s voice? Tamas\ncouldn’t blame him if it was. That many soldiers would make anyone\nnervous.\n“Think we can break them?”\n“We’d better. The cavalry will help.”\n“We’ve only two hundred, though,” Olem said."

We’re here to cause\npanic, and then slaughter. Not the other way around.”\nDuring the night, they’d had enough time to bring two hundred cavalry\nthrough the caverns. It was a testament to Tamas’s engineers that they’d\nmanaged to get the caverns wide enough to accommodate the passage of ten\nthousand men plus a platoon of horse in just one night.\nThe real victory of the night, however, had been six field guns. Small,\nfiring six-pound balls, and with five-foot wheels that would allow them to\nbe moved easily, they were just enough to give the impression of an entire\narmy on the Kez flank.\nTamas let his mind wander to the aftermath of the battle. They could\nrout the Kez, but they wouldn’t be able to pursue for long. Tens of\nthousands would be dead, but to the Kez that was just another number. They\nwould still have hundreds of thousands left. This battle would be to break\nthe morale of their army. The Kez couldn’t afford another loss on the\npsychological level of the Battle of Shouldercrown.\nTamas’s spies already reported that there were grumblings in Ipille’s\nministry. Given enough of a spark, the army might even turn on Ipille,\nthough that seemed too much to even hope.\n“Sir,” Olem said. “The columns are advancing.”\nTamas pulled himself back to the present. It was bad luck to think of\nvictory as the battle started. He had plans in place. If triumph came, then it\nwould be time to implement them. Not now.\n“Signal the men to get ready.”\nVlora crawled onto the knoll next to Tamas as Olem hurried away.\n“Are your men in place?” Tamas asked.\n“You mean Andriya’s men, sir?”\nTamas could hear the bitterness in her voice. He’d given Andriya\ncommand of the powder cabal for this battle, and it irked her. Tamas fought\ndown his own annoyance. When would she learn that, skilled though she\nwas, she did not have the experience to be in command?\n“My powder mages,” Tamas said sternly. “Are they in place?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“And you’ve sighted the last of the Kez Privileged?”\n“They’re hanging back,” Vlora said. “They think we’re on Budwiel’s\nwalls, waiting for them, so they’re well behind the columns. Quite within\nrange of us here. You signal the attack, sir, and we’ll drop the Privileged.”\n“Excellent. Get to your position.”\nVlora crawled off the knoll without another word. Tamas looked over\nhis shoulder to watch her go.\n“All ready, sir.” Olem came jogging up the hill and threw himself to the\nground beside Tamas. “Time to hurry up and wait.” He caught the way\nTamas was looking.\n“Still thinking of punching her, sir?”\nTamas gave Olem a wry look. Since when had his men gotten away with\nspeaking that way to him? “No.”\n“You seem angry, sir.”"

Since when had his men gotten away with\nspeaking that way to him? “No.”\n“You seem angry, sir.”\n“She has a lot of growing up to do still. I’m mostly sad. Had things gone\ndifferently, she might be my daughter-in-law by now.” He sighed and\nbrought the looking glass back to his eye. “Taniel might not have been on\nthat damned mountain and lying in a coma under the House of Nobles.”\nOlem’s voice was quiet. “He might not have been there to put a bullet in\nKresimir’s eye and save us all, sir.”\nTamas drummed his fingers against his looking glass. Olem was right, of\ncourse. Change one event in history, and you might as well change\neverything that followed. What concerned him now was trying to find a\nway to bring Taniel out of his coma, and to keep his body safe until he did.\nAs if he could read Tamas’s thoughts, Olem said, “He’ll be all right, sir.\nI’ve got some of my best Riflejacks keeping an eye on him.”\nTamas wanted to turn to Olem, to thank him for the reassurance. But\nnow was not the time for worry or sentiment. “The lines are beginning to\nadvance,” Tamas said. “Make sure the men hold. I don’t want the Kez to\nknow we’re coming until the right moment.”\n“They’ll hold,” Olem said with confidence.\n“Make certain. Personally.”\nOlem moved off to check on the brigades, leaving Tamas alone on the\nknoll for a few precious moments. Soon, an unending stream of messengers\nwould be requesting further orders as the battle began and raged throughout\nthe day.\nTamas closed his eyes and envisioned the battlefield as a crow might.\nKez infantry formed a half circle facing Budwiel’s walls. Their ranks\nwould tighten as they advanced to account for the terrain, and fill in the\ngaps from casualties caused by Adran cannon. A single line of Kez cavalry,\nperhaps one thousand strong, waited on the Great Northern Road for the\ninfantry to take the walls and throw open the gates, at which time they\nwould charge into the city. The rest of their cavalry camped over two miles\nbehind the battlefield. Most of them weren’t even on their horses. They\ndidn’t think they’d be needed today.\nThe Kez reserves waited behind the rest of the army. Their numbers\nwere a terrible sight, but Tamas’s looking glass and his spies told another\nstory: They were there for show only. Only one out of five had a musket.\nTheir uniforms were mismatched and off-color. Tamas shook his head. The\nKez had more men than they had guns. The reserves would break and run at\nthe first sign of his troops.\nThe rat-tat-tat-tat of Kez drummers reverberated against the mountains,\nand Tamas felt the ground tremble as the mass of Kez infantry began their\nadvance. He directed his glass toward the walls of Budwiel.\nThe heavy artillery, already firing on the Kez field guns, redoubled their\nefforts as the wall of infantry crept closer. Tamas could see soldiers of the\nSecond on the walls, their Adran blues looking sharp, their discipline\nsteady."

        "text": "efforts as the wall of infantry crept closer. Tamas could see soldiers of the\nSecond on the walls, their Adran blues looking sharp, their discipline\nsteady.\nAs the lines of Kez infantry reached the killing field, artillery blasted\nholes in their ranks. Those holes were quickly closed, and the tan-and-green\nuniforms marched onward, leaving a hundred dead for every dozen paces\nthey gained. The smell of gunpowder reached Tamas on the wind and he\ntook a deep breath, savoring the bitter sulfur.\nHe climbed to his feet and motioned over his signal-flag man. On the\nfield below their vantage point, he watched as the mass of Kez reserves\nshifted forward to take places behind the infantry. Tamas scowled. If they\nwere to take the city, it would be with the mass of infantry. Why would they\neven move the reserves into position…?\nHe felt a cold tingle down his spine. The Kez thought they’d be able to\nsack Budwiel today. They would secure the walls with their infantry and\nthen signal the reserves into the city to burn, rape, and plunder. Tamas had\nseen them do the same in Gurla. If they breached the walls, it would be a\nhorror beyond imagining.\nTo think they’d do it in a single day was beyond optimistic on the part of\nthe Kez commanders.\nHe couldn’t let that happen.\n“Signal at the ready,” Tamas said. The flagger beside him waved out the\norder. Tamas could see the eagerness in the man’s face. The Seventh and\nNinth were ready. They’d tear into the Kez flank with gusto. Tamas felt his\nblood begin to rise. “Wait… wait…”\nTamas blinked. What was that?\nHe put his looking glass to his eye. When he focused on the fields\ndirectly before Budwiel, he saw dozens of twisted men running toward the\nwalls. They wore black coats and bowler caps. Wardens.\nBut these Wardens… Tamas swallowed. He’d never seen anyone run\nthis fast, not even one of those sorcery-spawned killers. They covered the\nlast few hundred yards to the wall with the speed of a racing Thoroughbred.\nIn his glass, Tamas could see the wall commanders bellowing. Muskets\nopened fire. Not a single Warden went down. They reached the base of the\nwall and leapt, clinging to its vertical face like insects and scurrying to the\ntop. In a flash, they were among the gun crews, brandishing swords and\npistols.\nWait, pistols? Wardens didn’t carry pistols. Privileged had an aversion to\ngunpowder, and they were the ones who created the sorcery-spawned\nmonsters.\nSmall explosions rocked the top of the walls. Bodies fell from the\nfortifications, and one by one, the cannons ceased firing.\nTamas rocked back on his heels. What was happening? How could those\nWardens have gained the wall so easily? He smacked his looking glass in\nhis hand. Without the cannons to keep them at bay, the Kez infantry would\ntake the walls easily. They wouldn’t have the threat of artillery at their\nbacks to keep them from turning to face Tamas’s brigades head-on.\n“Sir,” the flagger said, “should I signal the attack?”"

The word came out a strangled cry.\nHe continued to watch as the infantry reached the base of the wall.\nLadders went up, and by the time the tan-and-green uniforms reached the\ntop of the wall, Tamas could not see a single Adran soldier left standing.\nThe Wardens had cut them all down.\n“Sir.” Olem appeared at Tamas’s side. He drew his own looking glass to\nhis eye. “What… what happened?” Tamas could hear his own disbelief\nreflected in Olem’s voice.\n“Wardens,” Tamas choked out. He wanted to spit, but his mouth was too\ndry. They were soon joined by officers of the Seventh and Ninth. They all\nlooked out at the battle together.\nKez infantry flooded the walls. Minutes later the front gates were thrown\nopen. The Kez cavalry charged up the road toward the gates.\n“We must attack, sir,” said a major whose name Tamas couldn’t recall.\nTamas whirled to his officers when he heard mutters of agreement.\n“It’s suicide,” he said. His voice cracked. “Budwiel is lost.”\n“We could salvage the day,” another voice said.\nTamas ground his teeth. He agreed with them. By god, he agreed with\nthem. “Perhaps,” he said. “Maybe we would be able to rout the tail end of\nthe Kez army. We could destroy the reserves and set fire to the Kez camp.\nBut then we’d be caught out on the empty plain, easily surrounded, and cut\noff from reinforcement.”\nSilence. These officers were brave, but they weren’t fools. They could\nsee he was right.\n“Then what do we do?”\nTamas heard a boom echo out from Budwiel. Smoke and dust erupted\nfrom the base of the West Pillar. He yelled for a scout to check the tunnels,\nbut already knew what had happened. The catacombs. Someone had set off\nan explosion inside of them, cutting off Tamas’s entry back into Budwiel.\n“I’ve been betrayed again,” he whispered. More loudly, “We keep our\nbacks to the mountain.” He tried to think of the closest Mountainwatch pass\ninto Adro. It would be a nightmare to move ten thousand men over any of\nthe passes. “We march toward the pass at Alvation. Tell your men.”\nGeneral Cethal of the Ninth Brigade caught Tamas’s arm.\n“Alvation?” he asked. “That will take over a month of hard marching.”\n“Maybe two,” Tamas said. “And we’ll be pursued.” He eyed Budwiel.\nSmoke rose from the city. “We have no choice.”\nHis stomach turned. Many of his men had family in the city, camp\nfollowers of the army. The Kez would put the city to the torch. The same\nfear techniques they’d used in Gurla. His men would hate him for marching\naway while the city burned, but it was their only hope for survival. He\nswore to get them back to Adro—to deliver them their vengeance.\nCHAPTER\n8\nA"

He\nswore to get them back to Adro—to deliver them their vengeance.\nCHAPTER\n8\nA\ndamat waited just a few shops down from the tailor’s. He sat on a stoop,\na newspaper in his hands. His disguise today was younger, with black hair\nneatly greased to one side of his head in the latest style of coffee shop\nowners. He wore pressed brown trousers and a dress shirt with cuffs rolled\nup to his elbows. A matching brown jacket lay across his knee. Before he’d\nleft that morning a quick application of Dortmoth whale ointment had given\nhis skin a youthful glow. A false black mustache and tinted spectacles hid\nhis face.\nAdamat watched over the top of his newspaper as traffic moved through\nthe street between shops and cafés. For two days he’d watched Haime’s\nshop. It was nearly three o’clock on the third day and he had yet to lay eyes\non Lord Vetas.\nHis position gave him the perfect view of Haime’s shop. He could see\nnot only the exit and approach clearly but through the front window and\nnearly everything that went on inside as well. Men came and went from the\nshop. There were very few women. At around two thirty a trio of big, hard-\nlooking men entered the shop. Adamat was sure they were Vetas’s goons,\nbut when they exited just a few minutes later, he could still see Vetas’s\njacket still hanging on the mannequin.\nAdamat half read the articles in the newspaper. The standoff in Budwiel\ncontinued, though since the news was three or four days old, anything could\nhave happened.\nThe paper reported that a sudden loss of income had caused Lady\nWinceslav to disband two of the eight brigades of the Wings of Adom. That\ncould only bode ill for the war effort. Four more brigades held position\nnorth of Budwiel, while the last two stood guard at the smoldering remains\nof South Pike, should the Kez army try a crossing of the volcanic\nwasteland.\nAs Adamat began to read through a story on the effect of the war on\nAdran economics, the movement of Haime’s door across the street caught\nhis eye. He looked up in time to see a dress disappear through the door. A\nmoment later a woman appeared in the window and began to speak with\nHaime.\nShe was a young woman with auburn curls. She couldn’t have been\nmore than eighteen or nineteen and, though young, she wouldn’t be\nmistaken for a mere girl. She had a confident bearing with a straight back\nand raised chin, and the red evening dress she wore looked tailored for her\nfigure.\nHaime turned to Vetas’s jacket and gestured. He waved his hand up and\ndown the jacket and then motioned to the bottom corner, where Adamat had\nnoticed the repaired rip. The woman nodded and Haime took the jacket\ndown and wrapped it carefully in tissue paper.\nThe woman emerged a moment later with a brown box under her arm.\nShe looked both ways, and Adamat resisted the urge to duck behind his\nnewspaper. Look casual, he reminded himself. He didn’t know her face. She\nmost certainly did not know his.\nShe headed west down the street. Adamat climbed to his feet, folding the"

Adamat climbed to his feet, folding the\nnewspaper and tucking it under his arm, and picking up his cane.\nHe followed her at a respectable distance. The key to trailing someone\nwas to stay far enough back not to be noticed but close enough that he\nwouldn’t lose her if she deviated from her course suddenly. It helped to\nknow whether she suspected that she was being followed. Adamat thought\nnot, but one could never be too careful.\nAdamat expected her to take a carriage within a block or two. She was\ndressed like a lady in that evening dress, and her heeled boots were not\nmeant for long walks. But she stayed in the street and veered northwest,\npicking her way along slowly. She stopped by a street vendor’s stall once to\npurchase a fruit tart, then continued on her way.\nShe turned down a quiet street in the Routs. It was a wealthy part of\ntown, predominantly known for the banking district at its center. The street\nitself had less foot traffic, which worried Adamat. At some point he would\nbecome noticeable, and that would be the last thing he wanted.\nHe fell back another forty feet before turning onto the same street. He\nwas just in time to see the woman disappear into a large three-story\ntownhouse.\nThe house had a broad front that came all the way up to the street. The\nwalls were white brick, and the shutters blue. It was quite large, of the type\nbuilt to house several families of the growing middle class. If it involved\nanyone else but Vetas, Adamat would have passed the house by as being too\nout in the open and ordinary.\nAs it was, he wondered if perhaps he’d made a mistake. Maybe the\njacket did not belong to Vetas. Maybe he’d been watching the wrong jacket\nthrough the window of Haime’s shop. Perhaps the woman had noticed him\nfollowing her and had come here to give him the slip.\nAdamat cursed under his breath. There were too many variables.\nHe walked down the street at a slow pace, taking long, casual steps as if\nadmiring the houses. He drew close to the house and made a mental note as\nto the number and street name, and let his eyes wander past each of the\nwindows. Surely, Vetas would have a man keeping watch if this was his\nheadquarters.\nNothing. Adamat tried not to dwell on disappointment, but there was\nabsolutely nothing to mark this house as belonging to Vetas. He would have\nto check the property records.\nJust as Adamat was passing by the last window, he caught sight of a\nface. It was a boy of six, watching as the traffic passed his home. He waved\nto Adamat.\nAdamat waved back.\nNo. This couldn’t be Lord Vetas’s house. What use could he possibly\nhave for a small boy?\nUnless Lord Vetas had a son. That seemed unlikely. The boy shared\nnothing of Vetas’s facial structure. A ward? No. Vetas was a spy for Lord\nClaremonte. He wouldn’t keep a ward. Perhaps another hostage? That did\nseem a possibility.\nAdamat continued down the street. He’d take the next carriage and come"

He’d take the next carriage and come\nback and stake out the house. It was his only lead at this point.\nHe climbed into a carriage and took his seat, only to find someone else\nclimb in behind him. It was a street sweeper, his face and clothes grimy\nfrom a long day at work in the sun.\n“Pardon me,” Adamat started to say, when he saw the pistol in the street\nsweeper’s hand.\nHe felt a cold bead of sweat trickle down the small of his back.\n“What’s this all about?” Adamat said.\n“Your pocketbook,” the man said, his voice a growl.\nRelief swept over Adamat. A mugging. That’s all this was. Not one of\nVetas’s men, having recognized him going past. Adamat slowly removed\nhis pocketbook from his vest and handed it to the thief. It wouldn’t do the\nman much good. Only fifty krana in banknotes inside. No checks or\nidentification.\nThe man flipped through the pocketbook with one hand, sure to keep the\npistol on Adamat. A few moments and the man would exit the carriage and\ndisappear into the afternoon crowds.\nBut then, this was the Routs. Who had the stones to pull a mugging on a\nresidential street in the Routs in the middle of the afternoon? Adamat\nopened his mouth.\nThat’s when he recognized the child in the window.\nThat boy was the son of Duke Eldaminse. The royalists had fought a\nsmall war with Tamas in the city center with the goal of putting him on the\nthrone after Manhouch’s execution. Adamat remembered the boy from a job\nhe did for the Eldaminse family almost a year ago.\nThe thief looked up at Adamat. “Not good enough,” he said.\n“What?”\nThe thief flipped the pistol around in his hand, and the last thing Adamat\nsaw was the butt of the weapon coming at his face.\nWhen Taniel awoke, Fell was sitting next to his hammock.\nThey were back in Kin’s mala den. Smoke curled through the air, but it\nwasn’t mala. Cherry tobacco, by the smell. He could see Fell out of the\ncorner of his eye, a short-stemmed pipe hanging from the corner of her\nmouth.\nA woman smoking a pipe. Not something Taniel had seen often. Most of\nthe women he knew preferred Fatrastan cigarettes.\nThe union undersecretary was a handsome woman. Far too severe for\nTaniel. With her hair back and thin face she reminded him of a governess\nhe’d once had. He watched her for several moments through half-closed\neyes, wondering what she was thinking. She didn’t seem to notice that\nTaniel was awake. She was staring across the room. Taniel shifted in his\nhammock to see what Fell was looking at.\nKa-poel. Of course.

Taniel reached into his memory, but the\nonly thing he found was mala smoke and the ceiling of Kin’s mala den.\nBefore that…\nRicard Tumblar wanted Taniel to run for the First Ministry with him.\nThat meant politics.\nTaniel hated politics. He had witnessed firsthand the power grabs of the\nmercantile elite in Fatrasta as their war for independence marched toward\nsuccess; the backstabbing, the conniving. Ricard claimed that none of that\nwas to happen. Ricard claimed that these would be elections, open and fair\nto the public; that the government would be chosen by the people.\nRicard, like most politicians, couldn’t be trusted.\nBut that didn’t seem enough for a four-day mala binge. Why would\nTaniel come back to this hole and—\nOh yes. Ricard had mentioned something about informing Field Marshal\nTamas that Taniel was awake and doing well. Ricard, no matter what Taniel\nhad said, did not seem to understand that Tamas would demand Taniel’s\nimmediate presence on the front lines.\nThat was a good thing, Taniel tried to tell himself. He was useful. He\ncould get back there and help defend his country.\nBy killing. The one thing Taniel seemed to be any good at. Pit, he’d\neven killed a god. Not that anyone believed it.\nHe shifted in his hammock, reaching for his mala pipe and the enormous\nball of the sticky substance Kin had left him.\nThe mala was gone.\n“Awake?” Fell said, her attention leaving Ka-poel.\nTaniel pushed himself up. He checked his coat pocket—he still had a\ncoat, that was good—then his trousers and the lip of the hammock.\n“What are you looking for?” Fell asked. By her expression, she knew\nexactly what Taniel was looking for.\n“Where’s my mala?”\n“From what Kin said, you smoked it all. You ran out sometime last\nnight.” Fell tossed something into her mouth and crunched. “Cashews?” she\nasked, holding out a paper bag made from an old newspaper toward Taniel.\nTaniel shook his head. He checked the mala pipe. Nothing left. Then the\nfloor. “That thieving Gurlish must have taken the rest of the ball. I got\nenough to last me weeks.”\n“I know the rate you were smoking that stuff,” Fell said. “I don’t think\nKin gypped you. He knows where the money came from.”\nTaniel frowned. Where had the money come from? He looked up at Fell.\nAh, that’s right. Ricard.\n“You know,” Fell said, “Ricard’s mala den has much better quality mala.\nThe mats are silk, and the entertainment is better than Kin’s daughter.”\nTaniel felt his stomach lurch. He fell back into his hammock. Kin’s\ndaughter. Taniel didn’t remember anything. “Did I…?”"

Taniel didn’t remember anything. “Did I…?”\nFell shrugged and looked to Ka-poel. Ka-poel gave a slight shake of her\nhead.\nTaniel let out a small sigh. The last thing he needed to do right now was\nbed a Gurlish mala-den owner’s daughter.\n“What do you want?” he asked Fell.\nFell tapped her pipe out on her shoe and put it in her pocket, then tossed\nmore cashews into her mouth. “We got word from your father today.”\nTaniel sat up straight. “And?”\n“A few things of note to report. The Kez were preparing to attack the\nnext day. That would be three days ago. He was planning on leading a\ncounteroffensive with his best men.”\n“How many Kez soldiers?”\n“Rumors say a million. Tamas didn’t say.”\nHis best soldiers meant the Seventh and Ninth brigades. And rumors of a\nmillion? That was twice the size of the army at the Battle of Shouldercrown.\nEven if it were exaggerated ten times, Tamas was still leading ten thousand\nmen against a hundred thousand. Bloody brash fool.\nIt somehow made it worse that Tamas would probably win.\n“Oh,” Fell added, as if as an afterthought. “He asked after you.”\nTaniel sniffed. “ ‘Where’s my damned useless son? I need him on the\nline.’ Something like that?”\n“He asked if you’d made any recovery and if the doctors thought his\npresence would help in any way.”\n“Now I know you’re lying,” Taniel said. “Tamas wouldn’t leave a\nbattlefield for anyone.” Not even me. Especially not me.\n“He’s been very worried. We sent word that you seemed better, but who\nknows if it reached him before the battle.” Fell reached into her paper bag\nfor another cashew, a small smile on her lips.\n“But you didn’t tell him I’m awake?”\n“No. Ricard thought that perhaps you’d like some time to recover.”\nSo Taniel’s entreaties to keep his father in the dark had done some good.\n“More like he’s worried that Tamas will send for me the minute he\nknows I’m not laid out.”\n“That too,” Fell admitted.\n“Of course.” Taniel fell back into his hammock and sighed. He felt tired\nand used. What was he, other than a tool for others? “That old bastard\nTamas—”\nHe was cut off by the sound of a door upstairs banging open. The stairs\ninto the den shook, and a young man burst into the room. Fell got to her\nfeet.\n“What is it?” she said.\nThe messenger looked around wildly at the den. His chest heaved from\nhard running. “Ricard wants you at the People’s Court immediately.”\nFell crumpled up the empty cashew bag and tossed it to the floor. “What\nhas happened?”\nThe messenger looked at Taniel, then at Ka-poel, and back to Fell. He\nseemed on the verge of collapse.\n“We’ve word from Budwiel. The city has fallen, put to the torch. Field\nMarshal Tamas is dead.”"

        "text": "seemed on the verge of collapse.\n“We’ve word from Budwiel. The city has fallen, put to the torch. Field\nMarshal Tamas is dead.”\nNila sat beside the window, the curtains only slightly parted, and watched\nthe world stroll by in top hats and coats, canes clicking on the cobbles,\nwomen tipping their bonnets back to enjoy the sun on their faces. The\nsummer heat bore down on Adro, but no one seemed to notice. The weather\nwas far too nice to care.\nShe wished she was out there enjoying it. Her room was too stuffy, and\nVetas’s men had nailed shut all the windows in the house. The air was thick\nand humid, stifling, and moment to moment she felt as if she was going to\nfaint. Vetas had sent her on errands just yesterday, and the freedom of the\nsun on her face had felt so wonderful she’d almost left the city, forgetting\nVetas and Jakob and all the terrible memories of the last few months.\nHer heart leapt into her throat at the sound of the bedroom door opening,\nbut she forced herself not to react outwardly. It wasn’t Vetas. He came in\nfrom the hallway. Not from the door to the nursery, where Jakob played\nquietly with a small army of wooden horses and complained frequently\nabout the warmth.\n“Nila,” a voice said. “You must get dressed.”\nNila glanced at the dress laid out on her bed. One of Vetas’s goons had\nbrought it up for her an hour ago. It was a long chemise dress of white\nmuslin with a high waistline. The trim was crimson, giving it a flair of color\nat the hem and the bust, and the ends of the short sleeves. It looked\nincredibly comfortable, and much cooler than the evening dress he’d told\nher to wear during her errands yesterday.\nThere was a silver chain on her bedside table with a single pearl the size\nof a musket ball, and in a box a pair of new black knee-high boots that she\ncould tell with a glance would fit her perfectly. Three more outfits, each\nmore expensive than the last, hung in the closet.\nPresents from Lord Vetas. She’d never owned such fine clothing. The\ndress was plain enough, nothing gaudy, but the lines were absolutely\nperfect. A glance inside the hem had shown her the initials D.H.—Madame\nDellehart, the finest seamstress in Adopest. The dress cost more than any\nregular laundress would earn in a year.\n“Nila,” the voice insisted. “Get dressed.”\nThe expensive clothes and the jewelry made Nila sick to her stomach.\nShe might as well accept presents from a demon as from Lord Vetas. She\nknew they came with a price.\n“I’m not going to,” Nila said.\nFootsteps creaked across the floorboards. Faye knelt in front of Nila and\ntook her hand.\nThey’d been cooped up in this manor together for six days and Nila still\ndidn’t know much about the woman. She knew that Faye’s son was being\nheld as a prisoner in the basement, and that she had other children\nelsewhere, also prisoners of Lord Vetas. She also knew that Faye would kill\nVetas, given the opportunity."

        "text": "held as a prisoner in the basement, and that she had other children\nelsewhere, also prisoners of Lord Vetas. She also knew that Faye would kill\nVetas, given the opportunity.\nAt least, she’d try. Nila was beginning to wonder whether Vetas could be\nkilled. He didn’t seem human; he barely ate, he didn’t sleep, and he didn’t\nget drunk no matter how much wine he consumed.\nFaye tugged at Nila’s hand. “Up,” she said. “Get dressed.”\n“You’re not my mother,” Nila said. The words came out as a snarl.\n“She’d tell you the same thing if she were here.”\nNila leaned forward. “She’s dead. I never knew her, and neither did you.\nMaybe she’d tell me to break this window and cut my own wrists rather\nthan give in to Vetas’s demands.”\nFaye stood up. The kindly entreaty written across her face seemed to\ndisappear and her expression hardened. “Maybe,” she said. “If so, she was a\nfool.” Faye began to pace the room.\nNila had guessed her to be a housewife of some middle-class merchant.\nShe wondered what value Faye had to Lord Vetas. Faye hadn’t spoken of it.\nAnd only a few words here and there about her children. In fact, the woman\nwas far too calm. Ever since her initial outburst the night she’d been\nbrought in, Faye had been meek as a dormouse. Nila imagined that if she\nhad children, she’d not rest until they were out of danger. Faye was either\nvery patient—and a stronger woman than Nila gave her credit for—or\nsomething else. Perhaps a ruse by Vetas? A spy?\nThat didn’t make sense. Nila wasn’t worth spying on. If Vetas wanted\nsomething from her, he was the type of man to torture it out.\nEither way, Nila didn’t trust Faye. She couldn’t trust anyone here in the\nVetas’s lair.\n“If you don’t get dressed,” Faye said, “Vetas will take out his anger on\nyou or the boy. Maybe both.”\n“I’m not his whore,” Nila said.\n“He’s not asked you to do anything degrading.” The silent “yet” hung in\nthe air for a moment. “Just to accompany him on his errands. It’ll get you\nout of this damned house again. I’ll keep an eye on Jakob while you’re\ngone. Here,” Faye said, “let me help you.”\nNila let Faye pull her to her feet and strip off her old dress.\n“There’s new undergarments,” Faye said, lifting a small box from the\nbed.\nNila snatched the box and threw it to the floor. “I’ve seen them, thank\nyou,” she snapped. “Only a whore wears a shift like that.” She took a deep\nbreath, realizing that her hands were shaking.\nFaye let her arms drop to her side. She stepped to the nursery door,\nlooking in on Jakob, and then closed it. She turned to Nila, hands on her\nhips.\n“Have you seen the room in the basement?” Faye asked.\nNila stared back defiantly. Who was this old woman to demand things of\nher?\n“Well?” Faye said."

Who was this old woman to demand things of\nher?\n“Well?” Faye said.\nNila nodded sharply and tried not to think of the room with the long\ntables and blood stains and sharp knives on the bench.\n“He showed them to me, too,” Faye said. “When I first got here. I don’t\nwant to go to that room and I imagine you don’t, either. So keep him\nhappy.”\n“I’m…”\n“I don’t care who you are,” Faye said, “or why you’re here. But you\nseem to care for Jakob. Vetas is not the kind of man to hesitate in turning\nhis insidious practices on children.”\n“He wouldn’t.”\nFaye took a step closer to Nila. Nila made herself stand her ground, but a\nlook in the woman’s eye frightened her.\nFaye said, “He cut off my boy’s finger while I watched. While my\nchildren watched. We all screamed, and his goons held us back. Then he\nsent the finger to my husband, to ensure his cooperation in one of Vetas’s\nplans.” Faye spit on the floor.\n“And what are you doing now?” Nila said.\n“I’m waiting.”\n“For what?” Nila scoffed.\n“My chance.” The words were barely audible. Faye wiped a tear from\nthe corner of her eye and took a deep breath. “There’s time for fury. And\nthere’s time for patience. And Vetas’s reckoning will come.”\n“What if I were to tell him what you said? How do you know you can\ntrust me?”\nFaye tilted her head to one side. “Go ahead and tell him if you want. You\nthink he doesn’t know that I’d pull his guts out through his ass if I got the\nchance?” Faye shook her head in disgust. “My husband is an inspector. He’s\na smart man, a principled man. He’s always thought the nobility were a load\nof inbred fools. I once asked him how he could put up with a baron’s\nmockery or the obtuse idiocy of a duchess long enough to finish a high-\nprofile case.”\nNila remained silent, watching the side of Faye’s face while she talked.\n“He said,” Faye went on, “that swallowing his pride and being patient in\nthe face of adversity had allowed him to feed and protect his family for\nyears, whereas giving in to his instincts to fight back would only land him\nin prison, or worse. Waiting is all I can do right now. So I wait. And you\nshould, too. Put on the damned dress.”\nNila watched the woman for any sign of dishonesty. There was fire in\nher eyes. Fury. The kind only a mother is capable of.\n“Give me some privacy,” Nila said.\nShe was dressed by the time there was a knock on the door. Not from\nJakob’s nursery but from the hallway. Nila swallowed her fear as she heard\nthe door open and was glad that she had put on the clothes.\n“That’s progress,” Lord Vetas said. “Turn around.”\nShe turned to face him, forcing herself to meet his eyes.\nHe looked her up and down and slowly swirled the wine in the glass in"

I\nhave finally succeeded. You will accompany me to the luncheon as my\nniece. You are a shy girl, and will say nothing more than ‘yes, ma’am’ or\n‘no, ma’am.’ I intend on courting her, and she’ll be more amiable to the\nidea if I have a close female relative. I’ll only need you for a few weeks, at\nmost.”\n“Who is—”\n“That is of no concern of yours. Play your part well and you’ll find I\nallow you to keep the small measure of freedom I’ve permitted. Play it\npoorly and I will punish you. Understand?”\n“Yes,” Nila said.\n“Good. Where’s the boy?”\nNila wished there was some kind of lie she could tell him. But where\nelse would Jakob be but in his nursery? “Jakob,” she called, “come in here,\nplease!”\nThe door to the nursery opened and Jakob skipped across the room. He\nlooked up at Vetas with a smile on his face. “Hello!”\nVetas grinned at him. The expression reminded Nila of a polished skull\nshe’d seen once in an apothecary’s shop. “Hello, my boy,” Vetas said. “How\nare you enjoying your new clothes?”\nJakob spun around, arms out, to show off a smart suit of a blue jacket,\nmatching knee-length pants, and high socks. “They’re very nice,” Jakob\nsaid. “Thank you.”\n“My pleasure, child,” Vetas said. “I brought you something.” He stepped\nback into the hallway and came back with a box not much bigger than the\none Nila’s boots had arrived in. Setting the box on the floor, he flipped off\nthe top to reveal a set of wooden soldiers and horses, twenty in all.\nJakob gasped with delight and set about pulling them from the box all at\nonce, scattering them across the floor.\n“Take them to your room,” Nila said.\nJakob stopped unpacking and cast Nila a scowl. He put the toys back in\nand began to drag the box toward the nursery.\n“Do you like them?” Vetas asked.\n“Of course! Thank you, Uncle Vetas!”\n“You’re welcome, child.”\nVetas’s grin disappeared the moment Jakob was out of sight. He took a\nsip of his wine. “Be ready in half an hour,” he said. He left the room, and\nNila heard the door lock from the outside.\n“Uncle Vetas,” Jakob had said.\nNila wondered how Faye planned on killing Vetas, and if perhaps Nila\nwould get her chance first.\nCHAPTER\n9\nT\naniel hurried through the streets of Adopest, blinded by disbelief.

It was late\nmorning and the traffic was thick, and he had to shoulder his way past\npedestrians and dodge carriages and carts. He could hear Fell apologizing to\nthe people Taniel bowled over.\nTaniel paused momentarily to make sure Ka-poel was still with them.\nShe was right beside him, faithful as his own shadow. Fell appeared out of\nthe crowd. Of the messenger who’d found them in the mala den, there was\nno sign.\n“Pole,” he said. “Do you know if he’s dead?”\nKa-poel seemed taken aback.\nHe took her by the shoulders and pulled her closer. “Did you ever make\na doll of him? Do you have some kind of connection?”\nHer frown cleared and she shook her head. Nothing.\n“Pit.” Taniel turned around.\n“I’m sorry about your father,” Fell said, coming up beside him.\n“I’ll believe the old bastard is dead when I see his body,” Taniel said. He\nsuddenly felt ill as a vision of Tamas lying cold and stiff in an open coffin\nfilled his mind. He pushed the vision aside, but found himself leaning on\nKa-poel for support.\nShe looked up at him with her glass-green eyes. They contained a mix of\nemotions: anger, confusion, sympathy, resolve. Her eyes hardened and he\nlooked away.\n“Where the pit are we, anyway?” he asked. “I don’t recognize anything.”\n“Because you’ve been charging headlong through the crowds,” Fell said.\n“This way to the People’s Court.” She pointed east. They’d been going\nnorth.\nTaniel nodded. “Lead on,” he said. He still had his hand on Ka-poel’s\nshoulder. She hadn’t moved it. “Pole,” he said, “I…” He stopped. His mind\nwas a haze, but the man coming toward him along the street looked\nfamiliar. Taniel could have sworn he’d seen him hanging around Kin’s mala\nden. He was tall, with wide shoulders and a slight limp. Something was off\nabout him.\nThe man looked up and into Taniel’s eyes. It was all the warning Taniel\ngot.\nThe man took two great strides toward Taniel. He shouldered Ka-poel\nout of the way and then Taniel felt the man’s fist connect with his sternum.\nHe was thrown up, above the heads of the crowd, and then tumbled to the\nground, landing shoulder-first on the hard cobbles.\nTaniel gasped in ragged breaths. Had his ribs been broken?\nA small crowd gathered around Taniel. He heard voices asking if he was\nall right. A gentleman nudged Taniel’s arm with his cane. A woman\nscreamed.\nOnly one kind of creature could have hit Taniel that hard.\nA Warden.\nTaniel snatched the gentleman’s cane, ignoring a shout of protest, and\npushed himself to his feet in time to see a young woman thrown to the\nground as the Warden pushed past her and grasped Taniel by the throat with\nboth hands.\nSteel jutted from the Warden’s throat and stopped mere inches from\nTaniel’s eyes.

The Warden threw him to the ground and whirled, to reveal a\nstiletto jammed into the back of his neck right at the spine. The Warden\ngurgled, and attacked Fell, who danced out of the way quicker than Taniel\nwould have given her credit for.\nTaniel leapt to his feet and brought the cane down on the back of the\nWarden’s head. The hardwood cane splintered from the force of the blow.\nThe Warden barely flinched. He turned toward Taniel, then back at Fell,\nas if trying to decide which threat to attack. While they watched, he pulled a\nhandkerchief from his pocket and with the other hand reached back and slid\nthe stiletto from his own spine. Vile, black blood spurted from the hole in\nhis neck. Taniel heard someone be violently sick on the street.\nThe Warden pushed his handkerchief into his wound to stop the\nbleeding. The whole grisly procedure had taken less than five or six\nseconds. The Warden then turned on Fell, leaping quickly.\nTaniel was ready. He jumped forward, holding the jagged end of the\nbroken cane like a dagger in one hand. He drew back his arm to ram it into\nthe Warden’s back.\nSomething hit Taniel from the side. His teeth rattled. His vision went\ndark.\nA second later and Taniel was staring up into the distorted face of\nanother Warden. The Warden had his knee on Taniel’s chest and his hands\nclosed around Taniel’s throat. Taniel squirmed, but he didn’t have the\nstrength to fight. He needed powder.\nTaniel was able to bring his knee up between them, pushing the\nWarden’s weight off his chest. He brought the broken cane around with his\none free arm and stabbed it deep into the Warden’s arm. The Warden\nlaughed and put his knee back on Taniel’s chest.\nTaniel groaned as the knee was pushed into his sternum with additional\nweight. Ka-poel was on the Warden’s back. She stabbed her long needle\ninto the Warden’s spine again and again. The Warden shook like a bull\ntrying to throw off an unwanted rider. Taniel thought he felt something pop\nin his chest.\nThe Warden stood, unable to get Ka-poel off his back, and Taniel\ngasped, feeling the air rush back into his lungs with exhilaration. He needed\nto get out. To get away. He needed powder.\nHe rolled onto his belly and lurched up to his knees. The Warden lashed\nout with one boot, kicking Taniel back to the cobbles. Taniel struggled to\nhis feet. Behind him, Ka-poel fought to stay on the Warden’s back as he\nreached his over-long arms out behind him to try to peel her off.\nPeople were calling for the city police now.

Someone had to have some.\nHe stumbled over to a young man in a bowler cap who was carrying a\nrifle over one shoulder. It was a Hrusch, and it looked freshly bought—it\nhadn’t once been fired. Taniel grasped the young man by the front of his\nshirt. “Your powder horn! Give it to me!”\nThe young man tried to pull away. Taniel reached into his kit and felt his\nhand close around the smooth cylindrical shape of the powder horn. He\nwrenched it out of the bag triumphantly and spun back to see Ka-poel still\non the Warden’s back, if only barely.\n“Pole, down!”\nKa-poel released her grip and was thrown to one side. Taniel held the\npowder horn like a grenade and threw it overhand. He reached out with his\nmind to ignite the powder and warp the blast to blow the creature to bits.\nNothing happened.\nThe Warden caught the powder horn in one hand. He stared Taniel in the\neye and flipped the horn around so the tapered end pointed toward himself,\nand bit through the horn. Powder spilled out from between his lips. His\ntongue lapped at the powder, grinding it between his teeth.\nTaniel backed up until he thumped against the young man he’d stolen\nthe powder horn from.\n“Charges,” he said. “I need powder charges!” A cold sweat broke out on\nTaniel’s forehead. This Warden. This thing…\nThe young man turned and ran. Taniel heard screams and saw more\npeople fleeing. He felt his boot hit something as he tried to step back again.\nThe young man had dropped both his kit and his rifle.\nTaniel rummaged inside the kit quickly, sure not to take his eyes off the\nWarden. There was a handful of powder charges. He crushed the end of one\nbetween his fingers and drew a line of the black powder on the back of his\nhand. The Warden was still eating the powder from the powder horn. All of\nit.\nIt didn’t make sense, but somehow the Warden was a twisted reflection\nof Taniel himself. This Warden was a powder mage.\nTaniel snorted the powder.\nFor a few moments, Taniel thought he might faint. At the edge of his\nvision the world went dark before suddenly becoming so stark it hurt his\neyes. He flexed his hands, then felt his chest. No pain. He gritted his teeth\nand took the rifle in both hands.\nThe Warden charged him without warning. Taniel stepped to one side\nand gripped the barrel with both hands, bringing the stock back over his\nshoulder and whipping it out and around into the Warden’s face.\nThe hickory stock shattered and the Warden went down with a satisfying\nthump. He flopped onto his stomach and pushed himself to his knees, then\nrammed himself into Taniel’s chest.\nTaniel backpedaled, trying to stay on his feet. He wouldn’t be able to\nwrestle a Warden down on the ground—not if the Warden was in a powder\ntrance. Taniel set one foot behind him to stop his backward movement and\nwrapped his arms around the Warden’s middle. He jerked the Warden off\nbalance and let go."

He jerked the Warden off\nbalance and let go.\nThe Warden rolled away from Taniel and slowly got to his feet.\nThe creature’s face was a mess of pulped flesh and slivers of wood.\nBlood streamed from his nose and mouth, and one of his eyes was swollen\nshut. He bared his teeth at Taniel. Half of them were missing.\n“What the pit are you?” Taniel said.\nThe Warden cocked his head to one side. He lifted his brown hair, which\nwas tied loosely over his right shoulder in a ponytail, to reveal the raised\nred welt of a brand. The image of a rifle about the length of a man’s finger\nhad been burned into his skin.\nIt was the brand that Kez Privileged gave to powder mages before their\nexecution.\nThe Warden let his hair fall back into place. He watched Taniel for a\nmoment, then looked to his side. Ka-poel was there, her long needle in\nhand, crouched low. She snarled at the Warden.\n“Pole, get back…”\nThe Warden leapt toward Ka-poel. He moved with incredible speed,\ncrossing the distance in the blink of an eye.\nTaniel was faster now that he was in his powder trance. He shot toward\nthe Warden, only to see the Warden twist at the last second. Taniel’s fist\nsoared past the Warden’s face and he felt the Warden’s fingers tighten\naround his neck once again.\nThe Warden wouldn’t try to choke him this time. He’d wring Taniel’s\nneck, snapping it like a child snaps a matchstick.\nTaniel jabbed his hand at the Warden’s chest. The Warden barely\ngrunted. Taniel jabbed again and again, lightning fast. He felt the Warden’s\nfingers lose their strength. Ka-poel threw herself at the Warden. He\nbackhanded her, tossing her to the cobbles.\nTaniel saw red in the corner of his vision. His mind’s eye saw Ka-poel’s\nbody in the street, her neck bent at the wrong angle, lifeless eyes staring\ninto the sky.\nThe Warden suddenly sagged. Taniel made a fist with his hand, pulled it\nback…\nAnd stopped in horror. His hand was covered in the Warden’s black\nblood. Between his fingers, the flesh still clinging to it, he held one of the\nWarden’s thick ribs. He looked down. The Warden, collapsed, stared back\nup at him. His coat was soaked through with blood.\nTaniel saw the vision of Ka-poel’s lifeless body again in his mind and\nrammed the Warden’s own rib through its eye.\nHe stood for several moments, gasping in ragged breaths. Something\ntouched him and he nearly screamed, his body was so tense. It was Ka-poel.\nShe wasn’t dead. She put one small hand on his, heedless of the Warden’s\nblood.\n“I’ve never seen a powder mage do that,” Fell said, breathless, as she\napproached them through the empty street. The front of her secretary’s\nsmock was covered in black Warden’s blood, as well as in some of her own."

The front of her secretary’s\nsmock was covered in black Warden’s blood, as well as in some of her own.\nOne cheek was red and swollen, but she didn’t seem to notice.\n“Where’s the other Warden?” Taniel asked.\n“He ran,” Fell said.\n“You’re not just an undersecretary,” Taniel said, remembering the long\nstiletto Fell had fearlessly jammed into a Warden’s throat. “Wardens don’t\nrun.”\n“He did when he saw what you did to his friend,” Fell said. “I kept him\nbusy until then.” She sniffed. “You’re not an ordinary powder mage.”\nTaniel looked down at his hands. He’d punched through the Warden’s\nskin and ripped out its rib. No one could do that. Not even he could, in the\ndeepest powder trance. Then again, maybe a god killer could. Something\nhad happened to him up on South Pike.\n“I guess not.” He looked around at the carnage. The closest people were\nover a hundred paces away, watching and pointing. He heard Adran police\nblowing their whistles as they grew close.\n“This was a trap,” Taniel said. “A Kez trap. How are they in the city? I\nthought Tamas rooted out the traitor Charlemund and his Kez accomplice.”\n“He did,” Fell said. She seemed troubled.\nTaniel fingered a powder charge and closed his eyes. Back in a powder\ntrance. It felt incredible. His senses were alive. He could smell every scent\non the air, hear every sound in the street.\nHis heart still thundered from the fight.\n“I’m leaving,” he said, taking Ka-poel by the hand.\n“Ricard…” Fell began.\n“Can go to the pit,” Taniel said. “I’m going south. If Tamas is truly dead,\nand the Kez are making Wardens out of powder mages, then the army will\nneed me.”\nTamas rode beside Olem at the head of the Seventh Brigade. The column\nstretched out behind them, twisting along the Great Northern Highway as it\nrose and fell through the foothills of the Adran Mountains. His men were\nalready dusty and tired, and the journey to get back into Adro had barely\nbegun.\nThey marched northwest, unsheltered by Mihali’s sorcerous fog that had\nallowed them to escape the Kez army four days before. To the east, the\nAdran Mountain Range cut into the sky with craggy, snow-topped peaks,\nwhile the sweltering summer heat beat down on Tamas’s army. To the south\nand west, the Amber Expanse—the breadbasket of the Nine, and the source\nof the Kez’s great wealth—spread out as far as the eye could see.\nTamas would have preferred to march on foot beside his men. But his\nleg still had a twinge to it, and he needed to be able to get up and down the\ncolumn quickly. His orders had seen many officers’ horses redistributed to\nthe pickets, joining his two hundred cavalry in scouting.\n“We’re running out of food,” Olem said from horseback beside Tamas.\nIt wasn’t the first time Olem had mentioned rations, and it wouldn’t be\nthe last."

        "text": "“We’re running out of food,” Olem said from horseback beside Tamas.\nIt wasn’t the first time Olem had mentioned rations, and it wouldn’t be\nthe last.\n“I know,” Tamas said. His men had their basic kit with a week’s worth\nof road rations. No camp followers, no supply train. They’d marched\ndouble-time for four days now, and he had no doubt that some of his men\nhad already finished their reserve against orders. “Give the order for half\nrations,” Tamas said.\n“We already did, sir.” Olem chewed nervously on the butt of a cigarette.\n“Halve it again.”\nTamas looked west. It was infuriating. Millions of acres of farmland\nwithin sight, seemingly within a stone’s throw. The reality was they\ncouldn’t be any farther away. The closest crops might be eight miles distant,\nwithout roads to reach them. No way to traverse the foothills and get down\non the plain, forage with over ten thousand soldiers, and get back up to the\nroad without losing a full two days’ worth of marching.\nIt was their lead on the Kez armies that Tamas could not risk, even for\nfood.\n“Put together more foraging parties,” Tamas said. “Twenty men each.\nTell them not to range more than a single mile off the Northern Highway.”\n“We’ll have to drop our pace,” Olem said. He spit out his cigarette butt\nand reached in his pocket for another, only to examine it for a moment and\nslip it back in his jacket. He muttered something under his breath.\n“What’s that?” Tamas asked.\n“I said I’m going to run out of cigarettes sooner or later.”\nCigarettes were the least of Tamas’s worries. “The men are exhausted.”\nHe turned in his saddle to look back along the column. “I can’t push them\ndouble-time another day. The only way they’ve been able to go so fast for\nso long is thanks to the residuals of Mihali’s food.”\nOlem saluted and headed down the column.\nTamas wished that the god had accompanied them on the ill-fated\nflanking maneuver. He ran his eyes over the faces of the men of the Seventh\nand Ninth. For the most part, his men met his gaze. These were hard men.\nHis very best. They’d done twenty-five miles a day for four days. Kez\ninfantry averaged twelve.\nHe caught sight of a rider coming up along the column. The figure\nlooked huge, even on a cavalry charger.\nGavril.\nTamas tipped his hat to his brother-in-law as he came up alongside.\nGavril wiped the sweat from his face with one long sleeve and took a\nfew gulps from his canteen. He’d discarded his grungy Mountainwatcher’s\nfurs on the heat of the high plains and wore only his faded Watchmaster’s\nvest and a pair of dark-blue pants from an old cavalry uniform.\nHe grunted a hello. No salute from Gavril. Tamas would have been\nsurprised to get one.\n“What news?” Tamas asked.\n“We’ve spotted the Kez,” Gavril said. No “sir” either.\nTamas felt his heart leap into his throat. He knew the Kez were on his\ntrail. It would be stupid not to realize that. But for four days they’d not seen"

But for four days they’d not seen\nany sign of the Kez armies.\n“And?” Tamas lifted his own canteen to his lips.\n“At least two brigades of Kez cavalry,” Gavril said.\nTamas spit water all down the front of him. “Did you say brigades?”\n“Brigades.”\nTamas let out a shaky breath. “How far?”\n“I’d guess fifty-five miles.”\n“Did you get close enough for an accurate count?”\n“No.”\n“How hard are they pushing?”\n“Can’t be sure. Kez cavalry will make forty miles a day on the open\nplain if they push hard. An army of that size, and in the foothills—twenty-\nfive, maybe thirty miles a day.”\nWhich meant that if Tamas allowed his men rest and forage, the Kez\nwould catch them in seven days. If Tamas was lucky.\n“In six days,” Gavril said, “you’ll hit the edge of the Hune Dora Forest.\nThe terrain will be too steep for cavalry to surround us. They’ll be able to\ndog our heels, but nothing more. Not till we reach the Fingers of Kresimir.”\nTamas closed his eyes, trying to remember the geography of northern\nKez. This was Gavril’s old haunt, back when he was Jakola of Pensbrook,\nthe most famous womanizer in all of Kez.\n“The Fingers of Kresimir,” Tamas said. He knew the location, but it\nsounded familiar for more than just its mark on a map…\n“Camenir,” Gavril said quietly.\nTamas felt a sliver of ice creep down his spine despite the heat. A flash\nof memory, and once again he was standing beside a shallow grave, dug\nwith bare hands in the cold of night beside the torrent of a raging river. The\nend of a daring—but ultimately failed—plan, and the most harrowing\nescape of Tamas’s long career.\nGavril tugged at the front of his sweat-soaked vest. “We’ll be going right\nby. I’m going to stop and pay my respects.”\n“I don’t think I could find him,” Tamas said, though he knew it was a\nlie. The location of the grave was burned into his memory.\n“I can,” Gavril said.\n“It’s quite a ways off the road. If I remember right.”\n“You’ll stop too.”\nTamas looked back at his column of soldiers again. They marched on,\nthe dust rising above them carried into the sky by a light breeze.\n“I have men on the march, Jakola,” he said. “I’m not stopping for\nanything.”\nGavril sniffed. “It’s ‘Gavril’ now, and yes, you will be stopping.” He\nwent on, not giving Tamas the chance to object. “You can lose the Kez\nentirely at the Fingers. We just have to reach the first bridge before them.”\nThe Fingers of Kresimir were a series of deep, powerful snow-fed rivers\noff the Adran Mountains. They were impossible to ford, even on horseback.\nThe Great Northern Road traversed them by a series of bridges built almost\na hundred years ago."

They were impossible to ford, even on horseback.\nThe Great Northern Road traversed them by a series of bridges built almost\na hundred years ago.\n“If we can reach the bridge before them,” Tamas said, thankful to leave\nthe topic of that lonely grave behind. “Even if we do, the cavalry can go\nwest and around and be waiting for us when we come down onto the\nplains.”\n“You’ll think of something.”\nTamas ground his teeth together. He had eleven thousand infantry and\ntwo hundred cavalry, and just a four-day lead on a group of Kez cavalry that\ncould very well equal his numbers. Dragoons and cuirassiers had more than\njust an edge on infantry in open battle.\n“We need food,” Tamas said.\nGavril looked toward the west and the tantalizing wheat fields of the\nAmber Expanse. “If we slow down too much to forage, the cavalry will\nreach us before Hune Dora Forest. Once we reach the forest, there are few\nfarms. Foragers might bag deer and rabbits, but not enough to go around.”\n“And the city itself?”\nTamas remembered there was a settlement just south of Hune Dora\nForest. Whether the forest took its name from the settlement, or the other\nway around, Tamas did not know.\n“It’s generous calling it a ‘city.’ It has walls, sure, but there can’t be\nmore than a few hundred people. We might be able to buy or steal enough\nfood for a day or two.” Gavril paused. “I hope you’re not planning on\nstripping the countryside of everything. The people here have it hard\nenough. Ipille treats his serfs worse than Manhouch ever did.”\n“An army needs food, Jak… Gavril.”\nTamas stared toward the mountains, barely noticing the white peaks. He\nhad to balance this army perfectly. They needed food and safety. If they\nreached Hune Dora Forest without food, his men would begin to starve and\ndesert. If they took too long to forage, the cavalry would reach them before\nthe forest and have their way with the entire column.\nOlem returned from his task, cantering up beside Tamas and Gavril.\n“Olem,” Tamas said. “Signal the column to stop.” He paused to examine\nthe countryside. To the left of the road an overgrown field sloped down\ntoward a ravine a half mile off. “This here, it’ll do.”\n“For what, sir?”\nTamas steeled himself. “It’s time I talk to the men. Assemble them in\nranks.”\nIt took nearly an hour for the last of the columns to catch up. It was\nvaluable time lost, but thus far Tamas had left the officers to tend to their\nmen and keep them informed. If he was going to keep command of this lot\n—retain their discipline and loyalty over the next few weeks—he needed to\nspeak to them himself.\nHe stood on the edge of the road and looked down the slope. The field\nhad been trampled, the green replaced by Adran blue, standing at ease in\nranks like so many blades of grass.\nTamas knew that many of these men would die without reaching their\nhomes.\n“ ’Tention!” Olem bellowed.\nThere was an audible shifting of legs and straightening of backs as"

A breeze picked up, blowing down from the\nmountains and pushing gently on Tamas’s back. To their credit, not a single\nsoldier reached to steady his hat.\n“Soldiers of the Seventh and Ninth,” he began, shouting to be heard by\nall. “You know what’s happened. You know that Budwiel has fallen and that\nthe Kez push in to Adro, checked only by the Adran army.\n“I grieve for Budwiel. I know that you grieve with me. Many of you\nquestion why we didn’t stay and fight.” Tamas paused. “We were\noutnumbered and outclassed. The fall of Budwiel’s walls made our initial\nstrategy obsolete and we could not have won that battle. As you all know, I\ndo not fight battles that I will not win.”\nThere was a murmur of agreement. The anger at abandoning Budwiel\nhad dulled in the six days since. The men understood. There was no need to\ndwell on it further.\n“Budwiel may have fallen, but Adro has not. I promise you—I swear to\nyou—that Budwiel will be avenged. We will return to Adro and join our\nbrothers and we will defend our country!”\nA cheer went up among the men. To be honest, it was halfhearted, but at\nleast it was something. He raised his arms for quiet.\n“First,” he said when the noise had died down, “we have a perilous\njourney ahead of us. I won’t lie to you. We have little food, no baggage\ntrain or resupply. No reinforcements. Our ammunition will dwindle and our\nnights will be cold. We are utterly alone in a foreign land. Even now, the\nenemy has set their dogs on us.\n“Kez cavalry are on our trail, my friends. Cuirassiers and dragoons, at\nleast our number’s worth and maybe more. I’d wager my hat that they are\nled by Beon je Ipille, the king’s favorite son. Beon is a brave man and he\nwill not be beaten easily.”\nTamas could see the fear in his men’s eyes. Tamas let it stew for a\nmoment, watched the growing sense of panic. And then he reached out his\nhand and pointed to his men.\n“You are the Seventh and the Ninth. You are Adro’s finest, and that\nmakes you the greatest infantry the world has ever seen. It is my pleasure,\nand my honor, to command you on the field of battle, and if it comes to it,\nto die with you. But I say we will not die here—on Kez soil.\n“Let the Kez come,” Tamas roared. “Let them send their greatest\ngenerals after us. Let them stack the odds against us. Let them come upon\nus with all their fury, because these hounds at our heels will soon know we\nare lions!”\nTamas finished, his throat raw from shouting, his fist held over his head.\nHis men stared back at him.

He could hear his\nheart beating in his ears, and then somewhere near the back of the\nassembled troops someone shouted, “Huzzah!”\nAnother voice joined it. Then another. It turned into a cheer, then a\nchant, and eleven thousand men raised their rifles over their heads and\nbellowed their defiance back at him, buckles and swords rattling in a sound\nthat could have drowned out cannon fire.\nThese were his men. His soldiers. His sons and daughters. They would\nstare into the eyes of the pit itself for him. He stepped back away from the\nroad so that they would not see his tears.\n“Good speech, sir,” Olem said, sheltering a match from the wind as he\nlit the cigarette pinched between his lips.\nTamas cleared his throat. “Wipe that grin off your face, soldier.”\n“Right away, sir.”\n“Once this quiets down, get the head of the column moving. We need to\nmake more headway before night comes.”\nOlem went off about his duties, and Tamas took another few moments to\ngather himself. He stared to the southeast. Was that his imagination, or\ncould he see movement in the distant foothills? No. The Kez weren’t that\nclose. Not yet.\nCHAPTER\n10\nA\ndamat had spent the night in darkness, tied to a chair. At some point he\nhadn’t been able to hold back any longer and had soiled himself. The air\nsmelled of piss and mold and dirt. He was in a basement of a heavily\ntrafficked building and could hear the creak and moan of floorboards as feet\nmoved across them.\nHe’d yelled out loud when he first awoke in utter darkness. Someone\nhad come to tell him to shut up. He had recognized the grizzled voice of the\nthief and called him a bloody dog.\nThe thief had left, laughing to himself.\nMorning had come hours ago. Adamat could tell by the light coming in\nthrough the cracks of the floor above him. He could hear his own stomach\ngrumbling for food. His throat was parched, his tongue swollen. His neck,\nlegs, and back were all sore from sitting tied to the chair for fourteen hours\nor more.\nThe whale ointment he’d used to smooth his wrinkles and hide his age\nwas beginning to burn. The stuff was supposed to be wiped off in less than\ntwelve hours.\nHe felt himself begin to drift and shook his head to keep himself awake.\nSleeping in this situation was deadly. He needed to be awake. To be alert.\nHe had a head injury. It would take more light to tell if his eyes were\nfocusing properly.\nIt was difficult to tell where he was. Voices above him were muffled,\nand no particular smells—aside from those of his own piss and the cold\ndamp of a basement—stood out.\nAdamat heard the creak of a door, then saw a light off in the corner of\nhis vision. He turned his head—a painful movement—to watch as a lamp\nbobbed down a flight of stairs. He could hear two voices.

The\nvoice was nasal and high. “Didn’t have anything in his pocketbook but a\nfifty-krana note and a false mustache. No checkbook. No identification. He\ncould be a copper.”\nA voice answered him, too low for Adamat to hear.\n“Well, yeah,” the first voice said. “Most coppers carry a city mark on\n’em, even if they’re trying for a bust. Could be one of those undercover-spy\ntypes. The field marshal has been using them to root out Kez spies.”\nAnother murmured answer.\nThe first voice had an edge of panic when he resumed speaking. “We\ndidn’t know,” he said. “Toak said to grab ’im, so we did. He followed the\nlady back to the house.”\nThe speaker arrived in front of Adamat with the lamp. He held it to\nAdamat’s face. Adamat couldn’t help but shy away from the flickering\ncandlelight. He blinked against the brightness and tried to see the speaker’s\nface and that of the murmuring man. It could be Vetas. Vetas would\nrecognize Adamat in a second, and then he’d be a dead man, or worse.\n“My name is Tinny,” the first voice said. “Look up at the gov’na.” Tinny\ngrabbed Adamat’s chin and turned it toward the light. Adamat hawked the\nphlegm from his throat into Tinny’s eye. He was rewarded with a sharp\ncrack across the face that knocked his chair over.\nAdamat lay on his back, his hands crushed underneath him, stars\nfloating across his vision. He couldn’t help the moan of pain that escaped\nhis lips. He wondered if his wrists were broken.\n“Pick him up,” the murmuring voice said.\nTinny hung the lamp from the ceiling and righted Adamat’s chair.\nAdamat considered head-butting the man, but thought his head had taken\nenough damage lately.\n“What do you want from me?” Adamat tried to growl the words, but\nthey came out as a rasp from his dry throat.\n“That depends,” the murmured voice continued. “Why were you\nfollowing the woman in the red dress?”\nWhy…? So it wasn’t Vetas. Or Vetas hadn’t recognized him yet.\n“Wasn’t following anyone,” Adamat said. He tried to maintain a\nnorthwestern drawl. “Just shopping and going for a walk.”\n“Without any identification? And a false mustache? Put the light to his\nface.”\nTinny grabbed Adamat’s chin again and shoved the lantern up next to it.\nThe murmuring voice gave a soft chuckle. “Ah, you bloody fool.”\n“Fool for what? Going for a walk?” Adamat said.\n“I wasn’t talking to you.”\nThe lantern pulled away from Adamat’s face, and he could see Tinny\nclearly in the light. Tinny’s eyes were wide, his complexion pale. “It was an\nhonest mistake, gov’na. I swear.”\n“Leave,” the voice murmured. “Wait. Tell the master we have Inspector\nAdamat.”"

Adamat\ncouldn’t help the cold fear that spidered up the back of his neck. He\nsquinted in the poor light, trying to see the source of that murmured voice.\n“Adamat,” the murmuring voice said suddenly in his ear.\nAdamat started. He hadn’t heard the man move, and there wasn’t\nanother person in this dank basement. “Who, now?” Adamat said. Hold the\npose. Play dumb. Don’t let them break you.\nA soft sigh in his ear. A sudden blade against his naked throat. He had\nthe all-too-vivid recollection of a razor blade breezing past his throat not\nmore than two months ago. He pulled back instinctively, a sharp breath\nescaping him. The knife did not follow. A sudden tug at his bound wrists\nand they were free.\nHe rubbed some feeling back into them and stared straight ahead. He\ndidn’t dare assume that he’d been released. He might take a knife in the ribs\nor across the throat at any time. No doubt the man behind him was ready for\nsudden moves, and even if Adamat overpowered him, Adamat was still in a\nbasement beneath someone’s headquarters.\nAdamat still didn’t know where he was. The murmuring voice belonged\nto someone who recognized him, even in such ill light. He cycled through\nthe names of hundreds of men, trying to match a face to the voice, but to no\navail.\nHe felt, more than heard, the presence move back in front of him. He\ncould make out a heavyset shadow in a sleeveless shirt. A bald head shone\nin the candlelight. Definitely not Lord Vetas.\nAdamat tried to blink the blurriness from his eyes and took in a deep\nbreath. It caught in his throat at the slight scent of sweetbell and the\nrecollection of a similar scent in his own home the same night that the\nBlack Street Barbers had attacked him.\n“Eunuch.” The word came out of his throat with a strangled sigh of\nrelief. He felt his body sag against the ropes still tying his ankles to the\nchair, only to stiffen again a moment later as the realization set in that the\nProprietor’s eunuch might very well be working with Lord Vetas.\nThe eunuch turned toward Adamat. “There,” he said. “Pretense dropped.\nNow, what were you doing following the woman in the red dress?”\nAdamat sniffed. The smell of his own piss was somehow less bearable\nnow this his hands were untied.\n“Working,” he said.\n“On?”\n“I report to Field Marshal Tamas, and him only. You should know that.”\nThe eunuch tapped the side of his jaw with one finger, considering\nAdamat through narrow, unfeeling eyes.\n“We’re on the same side, aren’t we?” Adamat said. The question came\nout just a little too desperate for his liking.\n“In a few minutes my master will have decided what to do with you. If\nhe decides to let you live, I suggest that you keep this little run-in to\nyourself.”\n“ ‘If’?”"

If\nhe decides to let you live, I suggest that you keep this little run-in to\nyourself.”\n“ ‘If’?”\nThe eunuch shrugged. “I would like to know if we are working at cross-\npurposes. There are rumors about you, Adamat. Finding you where we did\ncould mean one of two things.”\nAdamat waited for the eunuch to elaborate on what those two things\nwere. He didn’t. “That I’m with you, or against you?” Adamat hazarded a\nguess.\n“These things are rarely so simple as ‘with or against.’ ”\n“I was following a hunch,” Adamat said. “Trying to find someone.”\n“Lord Vetas?”\nAdamat watched the eunuch for several long seconds. No tic. No hint.\nNo giveaways. He was as unreadable as polished marble. Was the\nProprietor working with Vetas, providing enforcement and tails, as Adamat\nfeared?\n“Yes.”\n“Why?”\nAdamat looked at his hands. In the dim light he could see the dark welts\nwhere they’d been bound. His fingers all still worked. For that he should be\ngrateful. He knew he wouldn’t feel the real pain and ache until he tried to\nwalk. He looked back up at the eunuch.\nStill unreadable. The truth could get him killed in this situation. There\nwere a hundred lies he could tell. Adamat considered himself a good liar.\nBut he could get himself killed with the wrong lie, even one told well, or if\nthe eunuch even suspected a lie.\nThe truth it was.\n“He took my family,” Adamat said. “Blackmailed me, and he still has\nmy wife and oldest son. I want to get them back, and then kill him slowly.”\n“A lot of violence planned, for a family man,” the eunuch said.\nAdamat leaned forward. “ ‘Family,’ ” he said. “Remember that word.\nThere is nothing that will make a man more desperate and more capable of\nviolence than endangering his family.”\n“Interesting.” The eunuch seemed unmoved.\nA door opened. Light poured into the opposite side of the cellar, and\nfootfalls thumped down the steps.\n“The master says bring him up, gov’na,” Tinny said.\nThe eunuch scowled. “Now?”\n“Yeah. Wants to see him.”\nAdamat smoothed the front of his soiled jacket. He didn’t think he could\nbe more nervous than he’d been when sitting in a basement, tied to a chair,\nat the mercy of who-knew-who, but he was.\n“I’m to meet the Proprietor?”\n“It appears so.” The eunuch extended a hand and helped Adamat to his\nfeet. “Don’t worry,” he said. “There are three men who know his face in all\nthe Nine. You won’t be one of them.”\nAdamat wasn’t reassured. He looked down at his pants, at the cold, wet\nstain sticking his trousers to his legs. “How will…”\n“Ah.” The eunuch gestured Tinny over. “Adamat is now a guest.

He\nstudied the decoration and architecture, but both were utterly useless to him.\nPolished wood floors creaked beneath his feet. The walls were plaster over\nwood, the candelabras of brass. It was a spacious affair, but demurely\nutilitarian.\nAdamat was led into a bathing room with hot running water. His clothes\nwere stripped from him without ceremony by a pair of handmaids, so\nquickly he couldn’t protest the impropriety of it all. When the eunuch had\ninstructed he be bathed by a couple of girls, Adamat had expected whores.\nThese were sturdy washing women.\nHis back and hair were scrubbed quickly, cold water splashed over him\nto rinse off the soap, and a fresh pair of trousers presented to him. When\nAdamat emerged from the bathing room, the same two women combed his\nhair and straightened his collar.\nTinny was waiting beside the door. In better light, Adamat could see he\nwas a sickly man of medium height. He wore a cut-across, double-breasted\ncoat with squared tails and a starched cravat. The coat, along with the cream\npants and knee-high boots, were so incredibly ordinary that Adamat\ndoubted he could pick Tinny out in a line of men on the street, despite\nAdamat’s having memorized his face.\nIt was Adamat’s Knack, after all. He never forgot a face, and he\nwouldn’t forget the Proprietor’s either. Just one glance was all he needed.\nTinny handed Adamat his pocketbook.\nAdamat flipped it open. The fifty-krana note was still inside. Along with\nAdamat’s false mustache.\nAdamat took a proffered coat from one of the women and stuffed the\npocketbook inside. He did it all without looking away from Tinny. The man\nreturned his gaze with a slight sneer and looked Adamat up and down.\n“It’ll be good enough,” Tinny said. “At least you don’t smell of piss no\nmore.” He gave Adamat a mean grin. “You’ve got a mark there on your\nface.”\nFrom where Tinny had struck him. Charming.\n“I see you cleaned the spit from yours.”\nTinny’s grin turned down at the corners, and he gripped Adamat’s coat.\nIn a low voice he said, “Master gives the word and I’ll carve you up. It’ll\ntake me three days to kill you. I know who you are. Copper. Don’t like your\nkind.”\nThis close Adamat could smell the wine on Tinny’s breath. That hadn’t\nbeen there before.

Of more interest was the way Tinny stood; a slight lean\nto his left, caused either by his left leg being shorter than the right or by\nfavoring an injury to his right.\nAdamat jerked his coat from Tinny’s grip.\n“After you,” Tinny said.\n“I insist.” Adamat waved his hand forward.\nTinny gave him a mocking bow and stepped into the hallway. Adamat\nwatched his legs. A definite limp, favoring his right.\nAdamat lashed out without warning, his boot connecting solidly with the\nside of Tinny’s right leg. Tinny folded sideways, his yell of surprise muffled\nby Adamat’s hand over his mouth. Adamat took most of his weight and\nlowered him to the floor, putting one hand firmly against his throat.\n“Don’t threaten to kill a man unless you know without a doubt you’ll\nhave the opportunity,” Adamat whispered. “Now, I’ve spent the entire\nsummer with the most powerful people in all the Nine breathing down my\nneck. Do you think I care about one limping henchman? Do you think I\nhave the time for you?\n“I’m going to go talk to your master. If it goes badly, he’ll kill me, I\nhave no doubt. But I promise, if they put me alone in a room with you, that\nit doesn’t matter how securely they bind me—I’ll get loose and I’ll kill\nyou.”\nAdamat released Tinny’s neck and mouth.\nDifferent kinds of men responded differently to those with power over\nthem. Some got angry. Some took it silently. Some were so terrified they’d\nbelieve anything you said, no matter how outlandish.\nFrom the look in Tinny’s eyes, Adamat believed him to be the last of\nthese.\nAdamat made his way into the grand hall. His whole body ached from\nthe night spent tied to a chair, and he worked to suppress his own limp. He\npassed a dozen men and women. Dressed unremarkably, just like Tinny.\nProbably messengers and the like.\nAdamat had been in the lairs of perhaps half a dozen crime bosses in his\nlife. Every one had either been an opulent palace or a scum-ridden den of\niniquity. The Proprietor’s headquarters was so ordinary that it almost\nshocked him. It might have been the offices of some powerful but money-\nconscious nobleman, for all he could tell.\nIn the grand hall there were enforcers. Big men, scowling at everyone,\npistols in their belts. They flanked the front windows and door. Adamat saw\na woman he recognized, a whorehouse madame from the east side of\nAdopest who’d once told Adamat where to find a killer. She was dressed in\nher very best, and she sat on a bench beside the front door. She looked like a\ngirl waiting to see the headmaster.\nSomeone gripped Adamat’s arm. He surprised himself by not leaping\nout of his skin, and turned to look up into the face of one of the big\nenforcers.\nBefore the man could speak, Adamat said, “I’m looking for the eunuch."

I’m to see the\nProprietor now.”\nThe enforcer opened his mouth, then closed it. He scowled. Obviously\nnot what he’d been expecting.\n“Adamat,” a voice came.\nThe eunuch drifted across the grand hall and nodded to the enforcer. In\nthe light of the day, Adamat could see that he was wearing a tailored brown\nsuit with long coattails and an emerald cravat. The big man stepped away,\nand Adamat let himself be led down a side corridor by the eunuch.\n“Where is Tinny?” the eunuch asked.\n“He tripped. Fell down some stairs. I told him I’d find you myself.”\n“Ah.” The eunuch didn’t seem like he would dispute Adamat’s story.\n“Well, if you’d step inside, the master will see you now.”\nThey’d stopped in front of a door at the side of the corridor.\nNondescript. Unadorned. Adamat looked up and down the hall.\n“Here?”\n“Yes.”\n“I see.”\n“You were expecting something else?” the eunuch asked. “Something\nmore grand, perhaps?”\nAdamat examined the plain trappings of the hall, caught sight of a\nwoman with a bundle of papers in her arms, wearing a long, plain dress and\nlooking so ordinary it hurt his brain.\n“No, I suppose not.”\nThe eunuch rapped on the door.\n“Come,” came the brisk order.\nAdamat stepped into the room and closed the door behind him.\nThe room was very well lit, much to Adamat’s surprise. It was a\nsignificantly sized office with fine wood paneling, high-arched windows,\nand a fireplace framed by ornate brickwork. Two well-worn chairs sat next\nto the fireplace, not far from the door. At the opposite end of the room was a\nwide desk, partially blocked by a screen. Adamat took note that, aside from\nthe fine rug on the floor, there were no decorations.\nBeside the desk sat a severe-looking woman with a sharp jawline and\npronounced crow’s-feet in the corners of her eyes. Her posture was\nimmaculate, her dress smoothed over her legs. A half-knitted scarf sat in her\nlap.\n“Inspector Adamat?” the woman asked.\nAdamat nodded, looking curiously at the screen. He could hear pen\nscratches from behind it.\n“My name is Amber,” the woman said. She pronounced the word like\n“amba.” “You must first know that if you see the master’s face, even by\naccident, you will die.”\nAdamat found himself suddenly less curious as to what was behind the\nscreen.\n“Sit,” the woman said, gesturing to one of the chairs beside the fire.\nAdamat sat.\nAmber went on. “I speak for the master. I am his mouthpiece, and you\nmay address yourself to me as if I were he, and I will address myself to you\nalso as if I were he. Now, I’d like to apologize for the evening you spent in\nour cellar. Most unfortunate.”"

Most unfortunate.”\nThe scratching of the pen had stopped. Adamat noticed that Amber was\nno longer looked at him, but behind the screen. Perhaps reading some kind\nof hand language from the master?\n“It was wholly unpleasant, I assure you.”\n“To the matter at hand,” the Proprietor said through Amber. “There is a\nman by the name of Lord Vetas that has been causing my organization no\nsmall amount of problems.”\n“I don’t know the name,” Adamat lied, wondering why he bothered.\nHe’d already told the eunuch about Vetas and his family.\n“Come now. He’s kept it very quiet, but the name has been passed\naround the very top levels of Tamas’s military cabinet. Along with yours.\nI’d find it a very large coincidence that my men stumbled across you\nfollowing one of Lord Vetas’s spies.”\n“Stranger things have happened,” Adamat said.\n“Such as Taniel Two-Shot,” the Proprietor said, “a celebrated war hero,\nputting a bullet between the eyes of a god on top of South Pike Mountain?\nOr Field Marshal Tamas, one of the most reasonable men in Adro, declaring\na chef the god of Adro?”\nAdamat drummed his fingers on his pantleg and watched Amber as she\nwatched behind the screen. It was disconcerting to carry on a conversation\nthis way, but he seemed to have no alternative. “You don’t believe that tripe,\ndo you?”\n“I didn’t say I believed it,” said the Proprietor through his interpreter. “I\ntend to only believe hard facts, but if I only acted on hard facts, I wouldn’t\nbe here. Half of my trade is whispers and rumors. Information.”\n“Information is power,” Adamat agreed. “You’ve certainly made your\nliving well enough.”\n“It’s not just power, it’s money. But I’ll give you this for free: Field\nMarshal Tamas is dead.”\nAdamat clasped his hands together to hide the sudden shaking of his\nfingers. Was this true? Could the field marshal be dead? If that was the case,\nAdamat was suddenly without a sponsor. His campaign against Lord Vetas\nalready had little enough backing for a man that dangerous, but sixteen\nsoldiers and an open checkbook was nothing to scoff at. Adamat wasn’t\nsure he was prepared to take on Vetas alone.\n“How do you know?” Adamat said when he trusted himself to speak.\nHis voice wavered.\n“I received this missive from General Hilanska of the Second Brigade\njust this morning.” A hand reached out from behind the screen and gave a\nnote to Amber. She in turn gave it to Adamat. “I assume his other\ncouncillors—Lady Winceslav, Prime Lektor, Ondraus the Reeve, and\nRicard Tumblar—all received the same note.”\nAdamat slipped the silk ribbon off the note and unrolled it. The letters\nwere Adran, but the single paragraph gibberish.\n“A cipher?” Adamat said.\n“Indeed. It says—”\nAdamat cut him off. “That Kresimir has returned and Field Marshal"

It says—”\nAdamat cut him off. “That Kresimir has returned and Field Marshal\nTamas was cut off behind enemy lines with only two brigades. He’s\npresumed dead.”\nSilence from the Proprietor. Amber stared behind the screen for several\nmoments. Her eyes opened a little wider before she delivered the\nProprietor’s response. “That was… impressive.”\nAdamat gave the missive back to Amber. “A perfect memory makes\nciphers very easy to decode. I spent two summers as a boy memorizing the\nkeys to over four hundred different ciphers, both common and uncommon.\nThat one is extremely rare, but I don’t forget. Kresimir. I thought Taniel\nTwo-Shot put a bullet through his eye?”\n“Gods. Rumors. I’ve built this empire in Adro’s underworld by making\nvery good guesses, and my guess here is that General Hilanska wouldn’t\nsay such a thing unless he believes it fully.”\nAdamat leaned back. He stared at the screen, feeling less intimidated for\nsome reason. What was behind that screen? What kind of a person? The\nhand Adamat had seen reach out was old, obviously male, with manicured\nnails. The Proprietor didn’t spend his whole life behind a screen.\nSomewhere else he had an assumed identity. One that allowed him to move\nabout in public.\n“Only a handful of people in Adopest know this information,” Adamat\nsaid. “Why tell me?”\nThe Proprietor seemed to hesitate. “Because it puts you to the wind.\nTamas was your employer.”\n“And you want to employ me?” Adamat felt his hackles rise. In all his\nlife he never thought he’d have a job offer from the Proprietor himself.\n“Ricard Tumblar will ask you to help with his campaign for the new\nministry. He’ll offer to pay well. I can pay better. Other than that, what role\ncould you possibly fill? A place back on the police force? I don’t think you\nwant to be walking the streets in uniform over the next few years.”\n“What would you hire me to do?”\n“That brings me around to my first question. What interest do you have\nin Lord Vetas?”\nAdamat tilted his head to the side. The Proprietor didn’t know about\nAdamat’s wife. Which meant the eunuch hadn’t told him yet. It also meant\neither the Proprietor wasn’t working for Lord Vetas or that he was not close\nenough that Vetas had told him about Adamat.\n“He has my wife. I’m going to find him, rescue my wife, and kill Lord\nVetas.”\nAdamat heard a low chuckle from behind the screen. He couldn’t help\nbut scowl.\n“Perfect,” the Proprietor said through Amber. “Just perfect.”\n“Why should you care about Lord Vetas?”\n“As I said, he’s been causing problems for my organization.”\n“What kind of problems?”\n“Ones that I can’t handle without things becoming very noisy. He has at\nleast sixty enforcers, and one of them is a Privileged.”\nAdamat’s heart jumped. A Privileged? Pit, how could he deal with"

        "text": "least sixty enforcers, and one of them is a Privileged.”\nAdamat’s heart jumped. A Privileged? Pit, how could he deal with\nsomething like that? “It might help if you were more specific about the\nproblems.”\n“None that concern you.”\nAdamat smoothed the front of his shirt again. “A turf war, maybe? Vetas\nis moving in on your sources of revenue? Stirring up trouble in the\nunderworld? Stealing your manpower, maybe?” That would explain why\nRoja the Fox was one of the guards holding Adamat’s children hostage—\nbut if Roja had gone over to Vetas without the Proprietor’s blessing, it\nmeant that Roja thought Vetas the stronger of the two.\nA scary thought indeed.\n“None,” the Proprietor said, Amber’s translation somewhat icy, “that\nconcern you. This meeting is over. You may leave.”\nAdamat blinked at the abruptness of it. “You don’t want to hire me?”\n“Not anymore.”\n“And you’re not going to kill me?”\n“No. Out.”\nAdamat stood and examined the room once more, careful not to focus\ntoo much on the screen. Everything here was of a very fine quality, but not\nhandcrafted. The paneling was milled, the candelabras secondhand. Even\nthe desk looked like the kind that were made a dozen-a-day at a large\ncarpenter’s workshop. Nothing here that could be traced.\nExcept the rug. Gurlish, by the design, and even to an inexperienced eye\nthe fibers were finely woven.\nAdamat fished inside his jacket for a handkerchief. He blew his nose\nnoisily and dropped it, then bent and snatched it from the floor, making sure\nto look away from the Proprietor’s desk.\nWhen he stood, Amber still had the expectant look on her face that told\nhim he’d overstayed his welcome. She glanced toward the door and he\nnodded.\nOutside, the eunuch stood by the door.\n“Stay here,” he said, going into the Proprietor’s office.\nAdamat took the moment alone to examine the fibers in between his\nfingers. There were only a few, all crinkled and dry. He couldn’t tell them\nfrom the lint in his pocket. But he knew a woman who might be able to\nidentify them.\nThe eunuch emerged from the office, pulling the door closed behind him\nwith a click. He seemed troubled. “You’re free to go,” he said. “Of course,\nwe can’t just have you walk out the front door. Keep the clothes.”\nAdamat opened his mouth to respond, when someone grabbed him from\nbehind. A rag was shoved over his mouth and nose, and the last thing he\nremembered was the overpowering smell of ether.\nCHAPTER\n11\nT\naniel was awakened from his half doze at the reins by the distant report\nof cannon fire.\nDark thoughts swirled in his mind, thick as the clouds of smoke in the\nmala den. He could still see the Warden eating black powder. He could still\nfeel the powder-enhanced strength in the monster’s twisted limbs. How\ncould the Kez have made one of those creatures out of a powder mage?\nFrom what he knew of Wardens and Privileged, that seemed impossible."

How\ncould the Kez have made one of those creatures out of a powder mage?\nFrom what he knew of Wardens and Privileged, that seemed impossible.\nThen again, so did stabbing a Warden with its own rib after ripping it\nfrom the creature’s chest.\nThe sudden sensation of falling made him grip the saddle horn in a\npanic, startling the horse. The world seemed to spin around him. He took\nseveral deep, ragged breaths. Even once he knew that he wasn’t actually\nfalling, his heart still raced. Five days without mala. His hands shook, his\nmouth was dry, and his head pounded. The heat of the sun beating down\ndidn’t help any of it.\nA cool hand suddenly touched his cheek. Ka-poel sat in the saddle\nbehind him, arms wrapped around his waist for most of the journey, for she\ndidn’t know the first thing about riding a horse. It should have been terribly\nuncomfortable to have her clinging to him in this heat, but somehow it was\nthe only thing that gave him relief.\nNot that he’d admit it to her.\nIt was early afternoon and the mountains were closing in on either side\nas they traveled into Surkov’s Alley. They’d spent the night in Fendale, a\nlarge city of some hundred thousand that was swelled to four times that\nnumber with army reserves and the refugees from Budwiel.\nWhat little sleep Taniel had managed in Fendale was restless and\nplagued with nightmares. He’d read once that the only way to sleep well\nafter forming a mala addiction was with more mala.\nKa-poel removed her hand from his cheek, to his decidedly\nuncomfortable regret. What would he do with this girl? She seemed to think\nhe belonged to her in some way. He could sleep with her, he supposed, but\nthe thought of it made him feel… conflicted. She was a savage, and his\nservant. A companion and nothing more. There wasn’t a soul in polite\nAdran society who wouldn’t think it most improper.\nWhen had he ever cared about what society thought proper, he reminded\nhimself. And a savage? Taniel had seen Ka-poel’s sorcery. She’d saved his\nlife on several occasions. She was anything but “just a savage girl.”\nTaniel tried to blink away the fog that permeated his mind, but with little\nsuccess. Drifting off like that could be dangerous. They would reach the\nfront by tomorrow evening, and from there he’d have to find out if there\nwere any other powder mages left in the army, and news of his father. And\nof course, he’d have to report to… to who? Taniel had never reported to\nanyone but Field Marshal Tamas.\nCould Tamas really be dead? Taniel was a little surprised to feel a lump\nin the back of his throat at the idea. He loved Tamas, admired him even, but\nhe didn’t like him, and they had never been especially close. After all, the\nold bastard had ordered him to kill his best friend. Taniel didn’t even know\nwhere Bo was now. Maybe he’d died on the mountain, or been executed by\nTamas weeks ago.\nTaniel hoped they were both alive—Tamas and Bo. There were still\nthings that needed to be said."

There were still\nthings that needed to be said.\nAs for Ka-poel… Respect. That’s all Taniel was feeling. And a feeling\nof hopelessness, for Tamas had been Adro’s best chance at winning the war.\nThey stopped to rest in one of the many little towns in Surkov’s Alley\nbetween Fendale and Budwiel. Normally a town like this would have a\ncouple thousand residents. With the war on, it was overflowing. Supply\ntrains flowed through the city, and infantry reserves walked the streets in\ntheir uniforms, enjoying a few days away from the front. Taniel watched as\ndozens of carts rolled by, carrying wounded and dead soldiers from the\nfront. He’d seen hundreds of such carts since leaving Adopest. It didn’t\nbode well for the war.\n“Captain, if you ignore me for another moment, I’ll have you flogged.”\nKa-poel, seated next to him on a grassy bank while they ate their lunch,\nelbowed Taniel in the ribs. Taniel looked up, feeling genuine surprise that\nsomeone was talking to him.\nA colonel sat on horseback, his narrow features twisted in a scowl. He\npointed his riding crop at Taniel. “Captain, what brigade are you with?” He\ngave Taniel a moment to answer, and then, “Wipe that stupid look off your\nface. Is that such a hard question?”\n“I don’t have one,” Taniel said.\n“Don’t have a… are you daft? Are you a captain in the Adran army or\nnot? Be careful how you answer, son, or I’ll have you brought up on\ncharges of impersonating an officer!”\nTaniel fingered the captain’s stars on his lapel. They were gold, as he’d\nused his silver buttons to buy mala and these were the only replacements he\ncould get on short notice. His powder-keg pin was in his pocket. Who the\nbloody pit was this man? Taniel had never answered to anyone other than\nthe field marshal. He supposed that technically he was attached to a brigade.\nThe Seventh, maybe?\nTaniel shrugged.\nThe colonel’s face turned red. “Major!”\nA woman in her midthirties rode up beside the colonel. “Sir?” She had\nlong brown hair tied back behind her head in a single braid, and a thin face\nwith a beauty mark on her left cheek. She saluted the colonel and then\nlooked down at Taniel.\n“Have this man arrested,” the colonel said.\n“Charges, sir?”\n“Disrespecting a superior officer. The man didn’t salute me, or answer\nmy questions, or stand in my presence.”\nThe major climbed down from her horse and gestured to a pair of neatly\ndressed soldiers to join her.\nTaniel watched the three of them approach. He took a bite of mutton and\ncheese, chewing slowly.\n“Stand up, Captain,” the major said. When Taniel didn’t respond, she\njerked her head to one of the soldiers. He bent to grab Taniel by the arm.\nTaniel lifted the pistol from his lap and cocked back the hammer,"

It’s a pleasure to meet you, sir, but it\nseems we’re supposed to arrest you.”\nTaniel locked eyes with the major. “That’s not going to happen today.”\nThe major retreated for a moment and held a quiet conference with the\ncolonel. A few moments later the colonel nodded and the major and the\nsoldiers were dismissed.\nTaniel returned to his lunch, only to find the colonel still sitting on his\nhorse not ten feet away. The man rode a little closer. Taniel looked up. He\nwasn’t in the mood for this.\nThe colonel’s expression was still disapproving. “Captain, I’m sorry, I\ndidn’t recognize you. We’ve met before, but it was years ago. Your father\nwas a great man.”\nTaniel swallowed a mouthful of food. How was he supposed to answer\nthat? “Yes, he was.”\n“Captain, I should warn you. The field marshal was quite lenient with all\nhis soldiers, especially his mages. With his death there’s been a shift in\npolicy in that regard. I doubt the General Staff will make an exception for\nyou, even with your reputation. Point a pistol at a ranking officer again and\nyou’ll be—”\n“Shot?” Taniel asked, not able to keep the smirk from his face.\nThe colonel scowled. “Hanged.”\n“Thank you for the warning. Sir.”\nThe colonel nodded. “I’m glad to hear you’re on your feet again,\nCaptain. We need you on the front.” He paused for a moment, as if waiting\nfor Taniel to stand and salute him. He could have waited all day for that, as\nfar as Taniel was concerned. After nearly a minute he turned his horse and\nwas off at a canter.\nTaniel couldn’t help but wonder why the colonel wasn’t on the front\nwith the rest of the army.\n“Pole,” he said. “I don’t know if it’s a good idea for you to come with\nme.”\nShe rolled her eyes at him.\n“I’m serious, Pole. It’s a war zone. I know you’ve been in war before.”\nPit, she’d been with him facing down the same Kez Grand Army just a\ncouple months ago. He’d watched her butcher half the Kez royal cabal up\non South Pike. “But I’ve felt… strange since you brought me back. I don’t\nknow what I’ll do. I’d rather not get you killed.”\nTaniel again remembered the blood on her hands when he awoke from\nthe coma.

Whose, he\ndidn’t know, but the thought made him sick.\nKa-poel took the piece of cheese from his hand and tossed it in her\nmouth. That seemed like all the answer that Taniel was going to get.\n“Oh well,” he said. “I had to try. It’ll be good to have you at my side.”\nKa-poel pursed her lips in a sly smile.\n“My side, Ka-poel. I don’t—”\nShe put her finger to his lips, her smile widening.\n“They won’t like you being with me,” Taniel said. “There are some\nwomen soldiers, and fraternization is strictly prohibited. It happens all the\ntime, of course, but the officers like to keep up appearances. They might try\nto make you sleep in a different tent.”\nKa-poel spread her hands, questioning.\n“What? Fraternization? You know. Men and women being… together.\nIntimately.”\nShe pointed between them, then made a flat, chopping motion with her\nhand. But we aren’t. The grin on her face made the motion appear mocking,\nlike a child denying that they’d done something wrong when they’d been\ncaught doing it.\nIt made Taniel’s heart beat faster, and he could feel his face go red. “All\nright, girl, we’re going now. Just after I piss.”\nWhen he got back to the horse, he found her sitting in the saddle already,\nbut toward the front, as if she expected him to sit behind her.\n“Move back,” he said.\nShe ignored him. He pulled himself up into the saddle behind her, and to\ntake the reins, he had to wrap his arms around her waist. She snuggled up\nagainst his chest and he flicked the reins with a sigh.\nThe number of people along the road increased as they got closer and\ncloser to the front. In the last ten miles there were so many tents that they\nfilled the entire valley from one side to the other. It seemed like a sea of\npeople—soldiers, smiths, whores, cooks, laundresses, and merchants. He\nsaw soldiers with the stripes of just about every brigade in Adro, including\nall of the Wings of Adom, Lady Winceslav’s mercenaries. By now she’d\nknow that Tamas was dead. Taniel wondered if she’d pull her mercenaries\nout of the war.\nThe road seemed to disappear beneath the crowd, and Taniel knew they\nwere just one good rainstorm away from it becoming a shit hole of mud.\nThe Addown River cut through the whole thing, a dirty mess clogged with\nthe waste of hundreds of thousands of people. There were barges moored\nhere and there along the river—supply ships from Adopest, no doubt\nbringing food, weapons, and fresh recruits.\nThe tents gained some order as he finally reached the army proper. He\ndidn’t think he’d ever look forward to straight lines and discipline again,\nbut after having to push his way through the final few miles he was glad to\nleave the reserves and hangers-on behind him.\nFor most of the trip down the Alley the cannon fire had rumbled\ntogether like thunder in the distance.

        "text": "leave the reserves and hangers-on behind him.\nFor most of the trip down the Alley the cannon fire had rumbled\ntogether like thunder in the distance. Now he could pick out individual\nblasts. The artillery crew were working full-time, it seemed. That didn’t\nsurprise him; he’d seen the Kez Grand Army.\nWhat did surprise him was the crack and spark of sorcery he noticed as\nhe got closer. There were Privileged fighting on the front—on both sides.\nMost of the Kez Cabal had been wiped out at the Battle for South Pike or at\nKresim Kurga by Ka-poel. And where had Adro gotten any Privileged?\nIt took some questioning, but Taniel was soon able to find the closest\nofficers’ mess. It was mostly full of officers from the Third Brigade. He\ntossed his powder-keg pin on the bar.\n“I need a room,” he said.\nThe barkeep eyed him suspiciously. “No rooms here, sir. All full up.”\n“Kick someone out,” Taniel said. “I’m not sleeping in a tent in this\nmess.” Pit. He’d skin a man who tried to do something like that to him. But\nTaniel wasn’t about to leave Ka-poel anywhere in an army this size that\ndidn’t have a locking door.\n“I’m sorry, sir. I can’t do that.”\nTaniel looked down at his powder-keg pin. “You see that, right?”\nThe barkeep slid the powder-mage pin back across the bar toward\nTaniel. “Look, ‘sir.’ There aren’t any powder mages left in the army.\nThey’ve all been wiped out. So don’t try to pull one over on me.”\nTaniel rocked back on his barstool. All of them? Gone? “What do you\nmean ‘wiped out’? How could they be wiped out?”\n“They were with Field Marshal Tamas when he was lost behind the\nenemy lines.”\n“There’s not a single Marked this side of Budwiel?”\n“Not just this side of Budwiel. They’re dead.”\n“Have you seen the bodies?” Taniel demanded. “Well, have you? Do\nyou know anyone who has? Has there been recent news from Kez? I\nthought not. Now get me a drink, and have someone find out about getting\nme a room.”\nThe barkeep folded his arms across his dirty apron and didn’t move.\n“Look,” Taniel said, “if I’m the last living powder mage north of\nBudwiel, then I’m a damned celebrity. There are Privilegeds out there who\nneed to be killed. I’ll need a drink and eventually some sleep to be able to\ndo that.”\n“Is this man bothering you, Frederik?”\nA woman positioned herself at the bar and looked at Taniel, bemused.\nTaniel recognized her as the major with the beauty mark on her cheek. The\none who’d tried to arrest him earlier that day. Had she followed him?\n“Ma’am,” Frederik said. “He claims he’s a powder mage.”\n“He is. This is Taniel Two-Shot.”\nThe barkeep ducked a quick bow. “Sorry, sir. What will you have?”\n“Gin.” Taniel cleared his throat. “No apology needed.”\n“And for the savage?”"

What will you have?”\n“Gin.” Taniel cleared his throat. “No apology needed.”\n“And for the savage?”\nKa-poel was drumming her fingers on the bar, looking bored.\n“Her name is Ka-poel, and she’ll have water.”\nShe smacked him in the shoulder.\n“Wine,” Taniel amended. “Something with a light taste.”\nThe major regarded Taniel warily, sizing him up the way she might an\nenemy on the battlefield. “You let your servants treat you like that?” she\nasked.\n“I’m sorry,” Taniel said, trying not to let his irritation show. “I must have\nmissed your name?”\n“I’m Major Doravir, of the Third, adjutant to General Ket.”\n“My ‘servant’ is a Bone-eye, Major. A sorcerer more powerful than half\nthe Kez Cabal put together.”\nDoravir seemed doubtful. “Is she your wife?”\n“No.”\n“Your fiancée?”\nTaniel glanced at Ka-poel. Had he given this major that impression?\n“No.”\n“Does she have a rank?”\n“No.”\n“Then she doesn’t belong in the officers’ mess. She can wait for you\noutside.”\n“She’s my guest, Major.”\n“With all the crowds, General Ket has declared that only spouses may\nstay with officers at the mess. Too many men bringing their whores back to\nsleep with them.”\nTaniel felt his fingers creeping toward the pistol at his belt, but\nremembered the advice the colonel had given him earlier in the day. No, he\ncouldn’t do that here. He turned to Ka-poel. “Pole, will you marry me?”\nKa-poel gave one serious nod.\nPit. Taniel hoped she saw what he was playing at. He turned back to\nDoravir. “She’s my fiancée.” He glanced at the barkeep. “Get me a room.”\nDoravir snorted out her nose. “You’re funny, Two-Shot. You can stay\nwith me in my room. Frederik, give him a key.”\n“And my fiancée here?”\n“She can stay in the closet.” Doravir gave Ka-poel a mocking smile.\nThat did not bode well.\nTaniel took the glass of gin from the bar and drained it in one swallow. It\nalmost knocked him clean off his feet. How long had it been since he’d\ndrunk hard liquor? He blinked a few times, hoping his eyes weren’t visibly\nwatering. “I’ll stay somewhere else, thank you.”\n“Good luck.” Doravir snorted. “There’s not an empty room within five\nmiles of the front, and with Tamas gone, no one will put up with a mere\ncaptain shoving them out. You’ll have to push a private from his tent.”\nTaniel took some pleasure in the annoyance in Doravir’s voice. “I think\nI’ll do that, then. Come on, Ka-poel.”\nAdamat was slapped awake with rough hands. He jerked forward, reaching\nfor a cane that wasn’t there, and groggily took stock of his surroundings.\nHe was in the back of a carriage with one other man—the same\npickpocket who’d pistol-whipped him before taking him to the Proprietor’s."

Outside, he could hear the general bustle of an\nevening crowd.\n“Toak, was it?” Adamat asked.\nThe man nodded. He held a pistol in his right hand, hammer back,\npointed at Adamat. “Get out.”\n“Where am I?”\n“Quarter mile north of Elections Square,” Toak said. “Get out.”\nAdamat climbed from the carriage and held his hand up to shade his\neyes from the afternoon sun. As soon as he was off the running board, the\ncarriage took off, disappearing down the street. Adamat rubbed his eyes and\ntried to get his mind working. He felt nauseous. What had they given him?\nAh, yes. Ether. He’d be in a fog for hours yet.\nHe spent until just before dark at a nearby café, nursing a soda water to\nsettle his stomach.\nWhy had the Proprietor offered him employment and then simply\ndumped him back on the street? A very strange way to act. The Proprietor\nwas known for secrecy and efficiency. For keeping his promises and\ndestroying his competition. He was not known for behaving strangely.\nIt had to be something Adamat had said.\nAdamat blamed the ether when it took him well over an hour to realize\nthe obvious.\nThe Proprietor had intended on paying him to go after Lord Vetas. But\nwhy pay a man to do something he already plans to do? Adamat shook his\nhead. Stupid. On both his part and the Proprietor’s. If Tamas was truly dead,\nAdamat would lose the few soldiers Tamas had granted him. Adamat\ncouldn’t take Lord Vetas alone.\nAdamat knew where Lord Vetas was holing up. The house with the\nwoman in the red dress. The house where he had seen the Eldaminse boy.\nNow that he knew that, a frontal assault would be necessary. The same\nas they had done to rescue Adamat’s family. Smash open the doors, take\nthem by surprise. A man like Lord Vetas would have guards. What had the\nProprietor said? At least sixty men and a Privileged.\nAdamat needed manpower. He needed help. The Proprietor’s help.\nNo doubt the Proprietor would have had him followed. The location of\nAdamat’s safe house, and the errands he needed to run, were not things he\nwanted the Proprietor to know. Adamat climbed to his feet and called for a\nhackney cab.\nHe changed cabs three times and cut through half a dozen buildings\nbefore he felt confident no one was following him anymore.\nIt was well after dark when he arrived at the textile mill. The looms were\nstill working despite the late hour. Adamat talked his way inside and\nclimbed rickety wrought-iron stairs up to a room overlooking the mill’s\nwork floor. Inside he could see a woman leaning over a brass microscope.\nShe was about forty, with hair dyed black to hide the gray roots. The walls\nof her office were lined with fabric samples of every kind—from cheap\ncanvas to fine silks that cost a hundred krana for a yard.\nHe rapped on the door.\nThe woman waved him in without looking up from her microscope."

Margy was one of Faye’s oldest\nfriends. Adamat considered telling her about the whole predicament before\ndismissing the thought. “I need some help,” he said.\n“Not a social visit, then?”\n“Unfortunately.”\nMargy turned back to her microscope. “Don’t you usually send Faye on\nthese kinds of tasks? How is she, by the by? I haven’t heard from her all\nsummer.”\nAdamat cringed. “Not well. What with everything going on with the\nrevolution and all that. It’s played like the pit on her.”\n“Sorry to hear that.” Margy suddenly spit on the floor, her face turning\nsour. “Damn that Tamas and his damned coup!”\n“Margy?” Adamat couldn’t keep the shock from his voice. Margy had\nalways been outspoken, but he wouldn’t have put her as a royalist by any\nmeans. She’d risen to be head foreman of the biggest textile mill in all of\nAdro by her own hand, not by any kind of appointment.\n“He’s gonna take us all to the pit,” Margy said, wagging her finger at\nAdamat. “Just you wait. I hope you don’t buy into all this nonsense about\nhim trying to make a better world. It’s just a power grab, that’s all.”\nAdamat raised his hands. “I stay out of politics.”\n“We all have to choose sides one day, Adamat.” She tucked a stray wisp\nof hair behind her ear and cleared her throat. Adamat could tell she was a\nlittle embarrassed by her outburst. “Now what did you need?”\nAdamat removed the fibers from his pocket carefully, hoping he was\ngiving her bits of the Proprietor’s rug and not string from his borrowed\njacket. “I need to find this rug,” he said.\nShe took the fibers carefully. “This isn’t pocket lint, is it? Faye brought\nme pocket lint more than once.”\n“I do hope not.”\nMargy put the fibers under her microscope and spent a moment\nadjusting knobs on the side. “Vanduvian wool,” she said.\n“High grade?”\n“The finest. Whoever owns this rug is very, very rich.”\n“Any chance of tracing the rug?”\nMargy stepped away from her microscope. “I’d say so. Only a few rug\ndealers sell Vanduvians. I’ll ask around. Stop by in a couple weeks and\nmaybe I’ll have something for you.”\n“That long?” Adamat said.\n“You need it sooner?”\n“If at all possible. It’s a rather urgent matter.”\nMargy sighed. “It’ll cost you.”\n“I don’t have much money on me.”\n“I don’t want money,” Margy said. “You tell Faye that she’s taking me\nout for dinner at the Café Palms sometime before the leaves turn, and we’ll\ncall it square.”\nAdamat swallowed and forced a smile on his face. “I’ll do that.”"

They had four brigades\non the front, their uniforms brilliant in red, gold, and white.\nThe Privileged sorcery from both sides was weak at best. Fire splashed\nagainst shields of hardened air, and lightning sprang from the sky to strike\namong the ranks, but the blasts of power seemed halfhearted. Even a\nmercenary army as prestigious as the Wings couldn’t pay as well as a royal\ncabal, and it seemed the Kez were making use of the weakest and the\nyoungest sorcerers. After the carnage at Kresim Kurga, who did they have\nleft?\nTaniel swung his kit over one shoulder and frowned at the west side of\nthe Addown. The hillock on which he stood would make a good\nmarksman’s spot—high above and several hundred paces behind the\nfighting. But from what he could tell, the Kez had been pushing back the\nAdran army every day.\nThe front was about five miles north of Budwiel. The city smoked,\nflames visible over the poorest quarters of the city. Taniel wondered what\nthe Kez had done with all those people. Many, certainly, had fled north\nwhen the city fell, but not all of them could have gotten out. Now they were\nslaves, or dead.\nThe Kez had a reputation for brutality toward the people they conquered.\nKa-poel sat down on the hillock and opened her satchel in her lap. She\nremoved a stick of wax and began to shape it slowly with her fingers. Taniel\nwondered who she was making this time.\n“Can you do sorcery without those?” Taniel lowered himself cross-\nlegged beside her. “Without the dolls, I mean. And some bit of a person?”\nShe raised her chin and looked down her nose at him for a moment\nbefore returning to her work.\n“And where the pit do you get the wax? I never see you buy anything.\nDo you even have any money?”\nKa-poel reached inside her shirt and withdrew a roll of banknotes. She\nshook it under Taniel’s nose before putting it back.\n“Where did you get that?”\nShe flicked him on the nose. Hard.\n“Ow. Hey. Answer me, girl.”\nShe raised her fingers, ready to flick again.\n“OK, OK. Kresimir, I’m just asking a question.” Taniel pulled his rifle\ninto his lap and ran his fingers along the stock. No notches. A clean barrel.\nBrand-new, this was. Test-fired, according to the soldier who’d given it to\nhim. Never take a rifle you didn’t fire yourself into battle. It was Tamas\nwho’d told him that. Tamas, who was most likely dead and buried in a mass"

        "text": "him. Never take a rifle you didn’t fire yourself into battle. It was Tamas\nwho’d told him that. Tamas, who was most likely dead and buried in a mass\ngrave along with the rest of the Seventh and Ninth.\nWhere did that leave the Adran army? Where did that leave Taniel? He\nwondered briefly if Tamas had left behind a will of some kind. Taniel had\nnever thought about that before. Since he was a boy he’d always thought\nTamas would live forever.\nThe fighting below consisted of nothing but an exchange of artillery.\nSome of the shells hit the soft ground, skipping through the Adran ranks,\nwhile others smacked into unseen sorcery and split apart, falling harmlessly\nto the ground.\nThe exchange seemed almost like a formality. Neither side was losing\nmore than a few men, and none of the artillery pieces were being hit.\n“Do you have any redstripes?” Taniel asked.\nKa-poel shook her head.\n“Can you make me more?”\nShe scowled at him and pointed at the wax in her hand as if to say, Can’t\nyou see I’m working on something?\n“I need my powder now,” Taniel said.\nKa-poel stopped shaping the wax and looked at him for several\nmoments, her green eyes unreadable. She nodded suddenly and pulled his\npowder horn from her pack.\nTaniel’s hands were shaking when he poured the first bit of powder into\nthe paper to make a powder charge. The black grit between his fingers felt\ngood. Almost too good. It felt like… power. He licked his lips and poured a\nline out on the back of his hand, lifting it to his face.\nHe stopped. Ka-poel was watching him.\nOne long snort, and it felt like his brain was on fire. Taniel rocked back,\nhis body shuddering, shaking. He heard a whimper—pitiful and low. Did he\nmake that noise? Taniel put his head in his hands and waited for what\nseemed like several minutes before the shaking finally stopped.\nWhen he raised his head, the world glowed.\nTaniel blinked. He hadn’t opened his third eye. He wasn’t looking into\nthe Else. But everything seemed to glow regardless. No, he decided. Not\nglow. It was like the lines stood out sharper than they’d ever been. The\nworld was clear in a way that a regular man could never understand. As if\nevery moment out of a powder trance was spent under water and only now\nhad he surfaced.\nWas it like this when he took the powder to fight that Warden in\nAdopest? Had he just not noticed?\nHow had mala ever felt like a good alternative to this? How could any\ndrug compare?\nTaniel felt the grin on his face and didn’t try to hide it. “Oh, pit. That’s\ngood.” He finished loading a dozen powder charges before stowing them in\nhis kit and hanging his powder horn from his shoulder. He got down on his\nchest and began to scan the enemy lines.\nThere were Privileged on the east side of the Addown. Most of them\nwore colorful uniforms and were surrounded by bannermen and\nbodyguards. A lot of Wardens, too. The Kez weren’t scared of powder\nmages, not with Tamas gone. They’d relearn that fear in the coming days.\nPrimary targets."

Practically anyone on a horse, it seemed. Where\nwere all their cavalry? Strange that the Kez hadn’t brought any of their\ncavalry north of Budwiel. Oh well. The officers would do.\nSecondary targets.\nThere were artillerymen.\nTertiary targets.\nTaniel felt the rumble in the ground before he heard the sound of\nhoofbeats. A few dozen yards to his left a group of some twenty Adran\ncavalry had gathered. Adran officers. A couple of generals. Taniel\nrecognized a few of them.\nGeneral Ket was a handsome woman of about fifty—handsome, that is,\nif he didn’t account for the ragged bit of skin where her right ear had been.\nHer broad face seemed somehow familiar, as if Taniel had seen her recently,\nwhen he knew for a fact it’d been years since their last meeting. She was the\ngeneral of the Third Brigade.\nKet wasn’t the only member of the group to have lost a bit of herself in\nbattle. General Hilanska of the Second Brigade was morbidly obese and\nwas missing his left arm at the shoulder.\nNone of them noticed Taniel.\nThey seemed agitated about something. Pointing and gesturing, all of\nthem watching the battlefield through their looking glasses. Hilanska\nshouted for the artillery to be moved back.\nMoved back? That was tantamount to conceding ground. Why would\nthey…?\nTaniel saw it now. Movement among the Kez lines. Whole companies\ncoming up just behind their artillery. An assault. The Kez intended to push\nthem back this day.\nTaniel narrowed his eyes. There were huge men among those\ncompanies. Giant, twisted forms.\nTaniel didn’t know if these were regular Wardens, or the new kind made\nfrom powder mages, like the kind that had attacked him in Adopest.\nEither way, this would go poorly for the Adran army.\nTaniel noted that the Adran artillery was staggered every couple hundred\nfeet. The artillery out front could be pulled back while those beside kept\nfiring. This was planned. Perhaps this was what they’d been doing the last\nten days. It made sense, if they knew they were going to lose the front line\nanyway.\nTaniel didn’t like it.\nHe left Ka-poel and headed down the hillock to join the officers,\napproaching General Hilanska.\n“Sir, what’s going on?”\nThe general gave Taniel a dismissive glance, then a second, longer stare.\n“We’re pulling back, son.”\n“That’s foolish, sir. We have the high ground. We can hold.”\nGeneral Ket brought her horse around behind Taniel, looking him up and\ndown. He wondered if she remembered him. He must look different after\nfour years.\n“Are you questioning your betters, Captain?” General Ket asked.\n“It’s a stupid tactic, ma’am. It assumes loss.”\n“Captain, you’ll earn yourself a demotion without an instant apology.”\nAnother general, a blond man with a stiff bearing, added, “I’d imagine\nthis is why he’s still a captain.”"

You\ndon’t recognize our boy here, do you? Taniel Two-Shot, hero of the\nFatrastan War for Independence. I’m glad to see you among the living.”\n“General.” Taniel dipped his head. Tamas had told him a tale or two\nwhen he was a boy about what kind of man Hilanska was—loyal,\npassionate. The best kind of companion to have with you on the line. He\nwas fat and and old now, but Taniel imagined him to be the same kind of\nperson.\n“I don’t care who he is,” Ket said. “No one disregards rank in this army\nand gets away with it.”\n“Tamas—” Hilanska began.\n“Tamas is dead,” Ket said. “It’s not his army anymore. If you’d—”\nThe argument was cut off by a messenger.\n“Sirs, the enemy is advancing.”\nKet spurred her mount down the embankment toward the front, shouting\norders.\nHilanska’s stallion pranced to one side as if in excitement. “Get my\nartillery out of there!” He looked down at Taniel. “I wouldn’t go down\nthere,” he said. “They’ve got a new kind of Warden. Smaller. Smarter.\nFaster. Never seen anything like it. ‘Black Wardens,’ we’ve been calling\nthem.”\n“They’ve been turning powder mages into Wardens,” Taniel said. “They\nsent two to kill me in Adopest.”\n“Glad to see they failed. Powder-mage Wardens. How is that even\npossible?” Hilanska gave him a weighing gaze. “All right, Captain. Go\ndown there and hold that line and I’ll move my artillery back.”\nTaniel returned to Ka-poel at the top of the hillock. She was making\nprogress on her doll.\n“The Kez are attacking,” Taniel said. “I’m going to fight.” Why was he\ntelling her? Was she going to stop him? Go with him?\nShe didn’t answer him, so he grabbed his kit and headed down toward\nthe front. Ka-poel would be safer back here out of the melee, he decided.\nBut would he? Ever since Shouldercrown, he had wondered who was\nprotecting who.\nThe Kez soldiers were already on their way, marching to the steady\nsound of the snare drums. Trumpets were sounding in the Adran camp, and\nmore men rushed toward the front.\nTaniel paused and scanned the approaching Kez. None of the Kez\nPrivileged were advancing, but… there.\nThe Wardens in their black bowler caps and black jackets came through\nmarching Kez infantry like dogs running out ahead of the pack. They\npractically flew across the empty field. Some carried small swords, others\nlong pikes. They howled like animals, an eerie sound that lifted above the\ncannon fire and the snares and trumpets and made Taniel shudder.\nTaniel dropped to one knee and sighted along his rifle. One breath.

Two.\nFire.\nHe willed the bullet on through the sky, burning the smallest bit of\npowder to keep it in the air. He focused on one of the Black Wardens. The\nbullet took only two or three seconds to bridge the space and…\nHe missed.\nTaniel couldn’t believe it. He was far behind the line, steady as a rock,\nwith no distractions. How could he miss?\nHe reloaded his rifle. The Wardens were coming fast. Once they reached\nthe Adran line they’d cause untold chaos. Taniel lined up another shot and\nsqueezed the trigger.\nThe bullet tore through a Warden’s eye, laying the creature out on the\nground. None of the Warden’s companions seemed to notice. One even\nsnagged the small sword out of the still-twitching hand, barely slowing his\ncharge.\nThere was no way Taniel was going to be able to stop any more. He\nhad… what? Another two shots before the Wardens reached the earthworks\nthat marked the Adran line?\nTaniel drew the bayonet from his kit and unwrapped it, fitting the ring\ntightly around the end of his rifle. He stood, ready to charge, pausing only\nto scratch a mark in the butt of his rifle with an old nail he kept in his\npocket. He thought suddenly of Ka-poel and wondered if he should have\nleft her alone.\nHe joined the flood of Adran infantry heading to the front, elbowing and\nshoving his way through. They weren’t moving fast enough.\nA call went out to hold the line. Taniel wasn’t going to be there in time\nfor the initial shock. His legs pumped beneath him, covering ground three\ntimes faster than any of the others. He felt a snarl rise to his throat.\n“Aim! Fire!” a nearby officer yelled.\nA plume of smoke rose from the front of the Adran line. Many of the\nWardens staggered. Some of them fell. Not nearly enough.\nThere was one section along the Adran earthworks that rose higher than\nthe others. Taniel could see that several officers had taken the high ground.\nIt was precisely where the Wardens would head. They’d leave the flat\nground to the regular infantry and go straight for the strongest spots.\nEven as the thought went through Taniel’s head, he saw several of the\nWardens change direction to run straight for the highest earthworks. One of\nthe big brutes outstripped them all. He had several dark spots on his coat\nand his body twitched as more musket shots hit him, but nothing could take\nhim down. He raised his sword and flew up the side of the earthworks,\nleaping over the top.\nTaniel slammed into him in midair. The impact tore the air from his\nlungs, and they were both flung back over the earthworks, rolling down the\nside. He felt strong hands on his chest and was thrown off the Warden.

The blade slid into the\nWarden almost up to the barrel, but seemed to have as much effect as the\nmusket shots had.\nThe Warden threw itself backward, off of Taniel’s bayonet and out of\nrange of another stab.\nTaniel whirled as another Warden came at him from the side. Taniel\nducked and thrust, putting the tip of his bayonet into the tender spot below\nthe creature’s chin. He had to let go of his rifle and leap to one side to avoid\nthe thrust of the first Warden’s sword. Taniel drew his own short sword and\nwaited for the attack.\nThe Warden paused to throw a whole powder charge into his mouth. He\ngnashed at the powder with blackened teeth and spit the paper on the\nground.\nTaniel had never been all that good with a short sword. He was fast and\ncompetent, but if this creature had any amount of training, he’d cut right\nthrough Taniel.\nTaniel caught one thrust and pushed the Warden’s sword to one side. The\nWarden bridged the gap with his other fist. Taniel was ready for it.\nHe caught the Warden’s fist and slammed his forehead against the\nWarden’s nose. He could feel the bone move back into the creature’s brain.\nThat alone should have killed it, but Taniel still felt struggle in the Warden’s\nmuscles. Taniel stepped back and slashed across the Warden’s throat. It\ngurgled and collapsed, clinging to life, but it wouldn’t be any more of a\nproblem.\nTaniel could feel the Warden’s black, sticky blood all across his face.\n“Oi!” Someone called from the earthworks above him. “They’re\ncoming!”\nTaniel realized with a start that the rest of the Kez army was almost upon\nhim. He snatched his rifle and scrambled up the earthworks, kicking dirt\nand swearing. The Warden had made it look easy. It most certainly wasn’t.\nSeveral hands helped pull Taniel to the relative safety of the earthworks,\nthen thumped him on the back.\n“Back to the line!” someone shouted.\nTaniel shook his head, resting for a moment on the earthworks barricade.\nHe clutched his rifle to his chest to keep his hands from shaking, and\nwondered if going over the earthworks like that had been a mistake.\nSomeone smacked him across the face. He half expected it to be Ka-\npoel, but when he lifted his eyes, he recognized Major Doravir. She looked\nfurious.\n“Do you have a death wish, Captain?” She grabbed him by the collar,\nshaking him like an errant schoolboy. “Well, do you? No one goes over that\nembankment without orders. No one!”\n“Piss on your orders!”\nTaniel shoved her away. He might have put his bayonet through her\nchest if he’d had any less control over himself.\nShe stared at him, a cold rage in her eyes. “I’ll see you hanged,\nCaptain.”\n“Try it.”\n“Load,” came an officer’s call.

Soldiers bent to reload their rifles, readying for the\nKez onslaught.\nTaniel turned away from Doravir and stuffed a bullet down his rifle. Out\nof the corner of his eye he watched her storm away, yelling orders.\n“Careful, Captain,” a nearby soldier whispered. “If that one turns her\neyes on you, she’ll sleep with you or see you dead. Or both.”\n“She can go to the pit, for all I care.”\n“She’s General Ket’s sister,” the soldier said. “She does what she wants.\nBut she’s a damned good officer. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”\nKet’s sister. That’s why he thought he’d seen Ket more recently. The\nresemblance was strong, even if Doravir had a thinner build. “A damned\ngood officer would let me do my job,” Taniel said. He dropped a second\nbullet down his rifle and secured it with a scrap of cloth.\nThe soldier stared at him. “You feeling all right, Captain? You just\nloaded that twice, and without powder.”\n“Ask yourself,” Taniel said with confidence he didn’t feel, “what type of\na man would leap the earthworks and go fight two Wardens by himself, then\nload his rifle without powder.” He licked the powder off his fingers to keep\nthe edge on his powder trance, and set the rifle against his shoulder. He\nsighted along the barrel. The Kez front line was still some two hundred\nyards distant. Well out of range of the muskets, while the Adran riflemen\nwould open fire any moment.\nTaniel found a pair of officers well back from the line and squeezed the\ntrigger. He floated the two bullets simultaneously, pushing them toward\ntheir respective targets.\nHe caught one of the officers in the chest. The man clutched at the\nwound and slumped in his saddle, causing panic in his bodyguard. Taniel\nwinced. The other bullet had missed the target. How could he be missing?\nHad the mala made him lose his edge?\n“Kresimir be damned,” the soldier beside him said. “You’re Taniel Two-\nShot. Hey”—he tapped the man beside him on the shoulder—“This is\nTaniel Two-Shot.”\n“Yeah,” the other soldier responded, “and I’m a general.”\n“He was just down in front of the barricade. Took on four Wardens all\nby himself.”\n“Nah.”\n“Saw it with my own eyes.”\n“Sure you did.”\nTaniel focused on the Kez lines. The rat-tat-tatting of their snares\nseemed to echo in his brain. He opened his third eye for a moment,\nwatching as the earth was bathed in glowing pastels, splashes of sorcery\ncovering every part of the battlefield.\n“You ready to die with us, Two-Shot?” the second soldier asked,\nbreaking Taniel’s concentration. It wasn’t phrased as a threat. Just a\nquestion.\n“No, not particularly.”\n“We’ve been falling back every day. Sometimes twice. Every time the"

Every time the\ndamned Kez advance like this. And each time, we lose three hundred men\nor more.”\nTaniel couldn’t believe that. “Every time?”\nThe man nodded solemnly.\n“Falling back…” Taniel craned his neck. The artillery had been wheeled\naway by now, back to the next row of trenches and earthen barricades.\n“Stupid bloody fools. We have to hold. We can’t let them push us back like\nthis. We’re practically hemorrhaging troops.”\n“I don’t know what an ‘hemorg’ is, but we’re bleedin’ men something\nfierce. We can’t hold. We tried, but can’t. Nothing stops those Black\nWardens. No matter how many we kill, there seems to be more.”\n“You’re awfully calm,” Taniel said.\n“Something peaceful about that, I think. Knowing you’re going to die.\nThat lad over on your other side—”\nTaniel took a glance. The kid next to him didn’t seem old enough to\nshave. His hands shook so hard his musket was swaying from side to side.\n“—that lad doesn’t have the same opinion I do.”\n“It’s just the jitters,” Taniel said. “We all get them.” Taniel glanced at the\nKez. A hundred and fifty yards. He reloaded his rifle, lifted it to his\nshoulder, and fired.\n“Not you,” the first soldier said. “I heard you put a round in a\nPrivileged’s eye for your first kill.”\n“That I did. But I learned to shoot from Field Marshal Tamas himself.”\nHe paused. “They teach you to shoot at targets,” he said to the young man\nbeside him. “It’s different when you realize there’s a man on the other end,\nshooting back at you. I was sitting two miles away. I had surprise on my\nside. But, lad, you take a deep breath and pull that trigger. Fire straight and\ntrue, because you might not get another shot.”\n“Lad,” Taniel had said. The boy was no more than five years his junior.\nTaniel loaded his rifle while he spoke, set, and fired. Another officer\ndropped.\nThe boy looked at Taniel. His hands hadn’t stopped shaking.\n“I don’t think your pep talk helped much,” the first soldier said.\n“Quiet down on the line!” That was Major Doravir. She had her sword\nraised above her head, a pistol in the other hand. “Aim!”\nThe Kez were almost in musket range. There were thousands of them.\nRank upon rank upon rank. Taniel could see now why it was impossible to\nhold the line. He remembered the Battle of South Pike and how they’d\nalmost lost the bastion a dozen times. They’d been guarding a pass from an\nenchanted bulwark only a hundred paces wide. Here, with nothing but\nearthworks between them and the Kez, it would be next to impossible to\nhold.\n“Fire!”\nThe front line and much of the second of the Kez offensive fell beneath\nthe volley. The Adran infantry began to reload."

The Adran infantry began to reload.\nBefore a second volley could be fired, the Kez lines came to a stop. The\nnew front line dropped to their knees and lined up their shots before firing.\nTaniel threw himself behind the safety of the earthworks. He pulled the\nyoung soldier down with him and listened to the volley, and then the thwap\nof musket balls ricocheting off the dirt. The young soldier struggled to get\nback up. Taniel held him down.\n“Line fire,” Taniel said. “They’ll fire that shot, then the next before they\ncharge. You wait…”\nThe second volley sounded. Taniel counted to three before he let the boy\nback up and came up himself, ready to fire.\nThe Kez charged with a mighty roar, their bayonets leveled.\n“Fire at will!” came the call.\nTaniel took a deep breath of the smoke from the powder. It made his\nhead buzz, his blood pump faster. His hands weren’t shaking from mala\nwithdrawal anymore. His body had found something so much better. He\npoured a bit of powder onto the back of his hand and snorted.\nThe Kez reached the bottom of the earthworks and began the steep\nclimb. Taniel rose up high enough to fire down at them, when he spotted a\nPrivileged about a hundred yards away with her hands twitching up sorcery.\nTaniel adjusted his aim and pulled the trigger.\nThe woman went down in a spray of blood, clutching at her throat.\nKez infantry poured over the earthworks like a flood breaching a levy.\nTaniel thrust his bayonet into a man’s stomach, cracked another soldier\nacross the face with the butt of his rifle. He leapt onto the rise to keep them\nfrom coming over, swinging and stabbing.\nHe barely heard the call for retreat.\n“Hold!” he screamed, knocking a grenadier off the earthworks with his\nrifle stock. “We can hold!”\nThe young soldier who had been beside him went down with a bayonet\nthrough his chest. Taniel leapt off the bulwark to his aid, skewering the Kez\ninfantryman like a side of beef.\nThe boy might die from a wound like that. It had gone straight between\nhis ribs—likely through a lung. If so, he’d drown in his own blood.\nBut Taniel couldn’t leave him there. The Adran soldiers were retreating.\n“Hold! Hold, you bloody bastards!”\nTaniel was almost alone on the earthworks. The boy lay at Taniel’s feet.\nThe first soldier he’d spoken to lay against the rear of the earthworks, dead\neyes fixed blindly on the sky. Major Doravir was gone.\nHe reached out and felt the powder of the Kez infantry. A thought was\nall it took to light it. He used his mind to warp the blast away from him and\naway from the earthworks. The sound rang in his ears, sending him to his\nknees. Every ounce of powder within a dozen yards went up.\nPowder smoke rose in the air, and charred corpses littered the\nearthworks. Groans and cries for mercy rose from the wounded.

He took a\nstep toward them, going to help hold the earthworks at the next spot, when\nhe realized he couldn’t see an infantryman in a blue jacket on his feet\nanywhere.\nIt was just a sea of sandy uniforms. The Kez had taken the earthworks.\nThe boy was still alive and coughing blood. Taniel slung his rifle over\nhis shoulder and grasped the young soldier under the arms, pulling him\nbackward toward the Adran camp.\nIt was a long haul, half carrying the boy over a hundred paces to the next\nset of earthworks. Most of the Kez ignored him. A few potshots skipped off\nthe dirt nearby, but the Kez were too busy securing the new ground. They’d\nlevel the earthworks and move back to their own camp, where they’d push\ntheir artillery forward another hundred paces and prepare for tomorrow’s\ncharge.\nExhausted, his head still buzzing from the powder trance, Taniel reached\nthe Adran army. “See to him,” Taniel said when a surgeon came running.\nThe surgeon balked and her eyes were wide.\n“He’s dead, sir.”\n“Just bloody see to him! Make him comfortable!”\n“No, sir. He’s not just dying. He’s dead already.”\nTaniel dropped to his knee beside the young soldier and put his fingers\non the lad’s throat. No pulse. He used the same two fingers to close the\nyoung soldier’s eyes.\n“Damn it,” he said.\nThe surgeon got on her knees next to him.\n“I’m fine!” He pushed away her fingers.\n“Your arm, sir.”\nTaniel looked down. His uniform had been torn through, leaving a\nbloody, jagged cut along his left arm. He’d not even felt it.\n“Surgeon,” a voice said, “tend to someone who’s worth it.” Major\nDoravir stalked toward them, her brown hair wild and her cheeks black with\npowder burns. Her jacket was gone, her white shirt stained with sweat and\nblood.\nTaniel got to his feet. “Major Doravir,” he said. “Didn’t have the\ndecency to die with your men, eh?”\nHer backhand jerked his head to the side. He touched his cheek. That\nhad been hard enough to rattle his teeth. “Do that again and I’ll break your\nhand.”\n“I was the last one away from the front on the retreat,” Major Doravir\nsnarled.\n“No,” Taniel said. “I was. We could have held that bulwark. Instead we\nlost ground and who knows how many hundred men.”\n“I obey orders. You don’t. No more warnings, Captain. I’ll see you\nhanged.” The major spun on her heel and marched off, shouting for the\nprovosts.\nTaniel rubbed at his chin and caught Ka-poel watching him from a\ndistance. She headed toward the battlefield, where Kez soldiers were\nleveling the earthworks and civilians from both sides were already\ncollecting the dead and wounded.\n“Where the pit are you going?” Taniel shouted.\nShe pointed toward the battlefield and held up a doll.

That\nwouldn’t work like it did on Kresim Kurga. There were too many enemies\nhere, and not enough dolls.\nTaniel glanced toward Major Doravir. She was speaking to two soldiers\nwith the insignia of Adran provosts on their shoulders. Military police.\nDoravir pointed to Taniel.\nHe decided it was a good time to make himself scarce.\nCHAPTER\n13\nT\namas climbed out of his tent and finished buttoning up the front of his\nuniform. He adjusted the gold epaulets on his shoulders and he wondered if\nthey’d have rain that day. The sky over the Adran Mountains to the east had\njust barely taken on a light halo, while the rest of the world slept on in\ndarkness.\nTamas gazed at that slight brightening and wondered how things went\non the other side of the mountains. Budwiel had fallen. The Kez were no\ndoubt pushing their way up Surkov’s Alley. Tamas hoped that his generals\ncould handle the defense. He grimaced to himself. With Budwiel gone, the\nfight could only go in Kez’s favor. His men needed him. His country needed\nhim. His son needed him. He had to get across these damned mountains.\nHe could hear rustling in the camp, and the low whistles of sergeants as\nthey kicked their men from their beds. The smell of smoke came from\ncookfires that no doubt had little over them.\nOlem sat beside Tamas’s tent. His forage cap was pulled over his eyes,\nhis legs propped on a log in front of him, and his hands thrust deep in his\npockets. The pose was an affected one. Olem’s Knack eliminated the need\nfor sleep.\n“Quiet night?” Tamas asked, squatting beside the small, smoldering fire\nand rubbing his hands together. The heat of the summer didn’t touch the\nearly morning, not in foothills like this. He poked the coals with a twig,\nthen tossed in the twig. No more than ash. There wasn’t much to burn on\nthe high steppe.\n“Little bit of rustling, sir. Some grumbling, too.” Olem sniffed as if the\ngrumbling were no more than an annoyance.\nHis men were hungry. Tamas knew it, and it pained him.\n“I put a stop to it, sir,” Olem said.\n“Good.”\nTamas heard soft footfalls on the dirt. Olem shifted, and his hand\nemerged just a little from his coat. He had a pistol.\nA carcass thumped to the ground beside Tamas. He started.\n“Elk, sir,” Vlora said as she squatted down next to him.\nTamas felt a little spell of relief. Meat.\n“Any more?” he asked, his voice a little too hopeful.\n“Andriya bagged one, too. He’s portioning it out to the powder mages.\nThis one’s for the officers.”\nTamas chewed on the inside of his lip. “Olem. Have it butchered and\ndistributed to the men. A small, raw piece for each. Let them cook it\nthemselves. We break camp in two hours.”"

He returned his pistol to his belt\nand headed off, calling a few names.\n“We’ll reach Hune Dora tomorrow by midday, sir,” Vlora said. Her\nshoulders were stained with blood from the elk. She had to have been\nburning a powder trance, otherwise there was no way a girl of her size\ncould have carried an entire elk over her shoulders.\n“How far?”\n“About sixteen miles. Went up that way while hunting.”\n“And?”\n“A small town, just like Gavril said.”\n“Walled?”\n“The wall is an old ruin. Eight feet high, maybe. I wouldn’t worry about\nit, though, sir. The city looks abandoned.”\nAbandoned? Tamas had hoped there would be some population, just so\nhe could loot their stores of powder and food.\n“Anything else up that direction?\n“The terrain turns steep. The road seems to follow the contours of the\nmountain ridges. Lots of bridges, from what I could see. Once we’re in the\nforest, the dragoons will have a hard time encircling us.”\n“As I’d hoped.”\n“The bad news is, the road narrows considerably. We’ll be able to march\nmaybe just three or four men abreast.”\nThat would require Tamas’s column to extend to almost four miles long.\nNot conducive to an army being dogged by dragoons. Tamas swore under\nhis breath.\nHe watched the sky for a moment. There wouldn’t be rain today, he\ndecided.\n“I lied, before,” Tamas said.\nVlora frowned at the embers of the fire. “Sir?”\n“Back in Budwiel you asked me if there was any news about Taniel. I\nlied.”\nVlora opened her mouth, but Tamas went on before she could say\nanything.\n“A few days before we went through the caves, I received a message\nfrom Adopest. Taniel’s savage was awake.”\n“And Taniel?”\n“Nothing. But if one of them can come out of it, presumably the other.\nAnd I wouldn’t think that little savage girl is stronger than my boy. He’ll…”\nHe heard his voice crack. “He’ll make it.”\nHe examined Vlora out of the corner of his eye. He thought he saw a\ntear on her face.\n“How is your leg, sir?” she asked.\nTamas looked down at his leg. Mihali had healed it. He could walk. He\ncould ride. Pit, he could dance if he wanted to. But deep inside the calf, it\nstill hurt. The pain throbbed, right where they’d taken that blasted star of\ngold out of his flesh. Despite the healing powers of a god, there was still\nsomething wrong with it.\n“It’s fine,” he said. “Good as new.”\n“You still walk with a limp,” Vlora said.\n“Do I? Just habit.”\nVlora leaned back on her haunches. “I’ve heard that healed tissue has a\nproblem readjusting itself. It needs help. Plenty of exercise and massage. If\nyou’d like…”\n“I don’t think I need the gossip that would come out of you rubbing my"

He chuckled, and was relieved when Vlora laughed as\nwell.\n“I was going to say have Olem do it, sir.”\n“I’m sure I’ll be fine.” Tamas watched Vlora a little longer. She glanced\nup at him, then back at the fire. She still wouldn’t meet his eyes.\nHe found he missed their old familiarity. If things had gone better, she\nmight be his daughter-in-law by now. Back before she went off to the\nuniversity, she’d been the one soldier with the gall to call him Tamas. She’d\nhung on his arm, even hugged him in public.\nBefore she slept with that fop in Jileman and Taniel broke off their\nengagement.\nTamas climbed to his feet. “I want you and Andriya to keep on hunting.\nWe need as much meat as we can get.”\n“We’re going to run out of powder eventually, sir,” she said.\n“Get some from the Seventh’s quartermaster.”\n“I meant the whole army.”\nTamas drummed his fingers on his belt. An army on the march, without\nresupply or even wagons and camp followers. They would run out of\neverything. Sooner, rather than later. Their only advantage was a swift\nmarch, and that was lost with having to forage and the exhaustion brought\non by hunger.\n“I’ll be sure the mages get what they need.” His powder mages were still\neach worth more than a dozen men.\nVlora nodded. “I’ll check with the quartermaster.” She stood and\nabruptly headed off into the camp.\nTamas watched her go, and felt himself an old man, burdened with\nregret.\nThe camp grew louder over the next few minutes as the last of the\nsoldiers were roused from their beds. A few cheers went up, and Tamas\nguessed Olem must have distributed the elk meat. It wasn’t much, not when\nspread so thinly, but it was a bite more than they’d had.\nTamas broke down and stowed his own tent. He’d just finished tying his\nbedroll when Olem returned with a bundle of bloody canvas.\n“I would have done that, sir,” Olem said.\nTamas eyed the bloody canvas and felt his mouth watering. “I have you\ndoing more important things. I was a soldier once, Olem. I can break camp\nas well as any man.”\n“If you insist, sir.” Olem knelt beside the coals and produced a skewer,\nthen unwrapped the bloody canvas to reveal a hunk of elk meat.\nTamas stood and looked to the south. Somewhere out there, the Kez\ncavalry were breaking their camp, probably hoping to overtake the Adran\nbrigades before they were able to reach the relative safety of the forest.\nTamas heard, more than saw, a horse galloping through the camp. A few\nmoments later and Gavril emerged from the still-dark morning on a\nshuddering charger.\nTamas grabbed the horse by the bridle as his brother-in-law swung\ndown. The horse’s sides were lathered, its eyes wild. Gavril had been riding\nhard."

How could they possibly fight that many cavalry? “How far?”\n“We can beat them to the forest if we leave now. I’ve not spoken with\nmy northern outriders.”\n“Vlora just came from the north. We’re sixteen miles from Hune Dora.”\nGavril accepted an offered canteen from Olem and took a swig, then\npoured the rest over his head. His body steamed. “We won’t have time to\nsack the city.”\n“She says it’s abandoned. I’ll have some men take a look, but we’ll\nprobably head right past it.”\n“Abandoned, eh?” Gavril scratched his bearded chin. “We could make a\nstand there.”\nTamas cast an anxious glance to the south. He couldn’t see the Kez\ncavalry, but it seemed to him he could sense them. “Maybe.”\nOlem stood and held out a pewter plate. On it was a steaming cut of elk.\n“Burned on the edges and raw in the middle, but it’s delicious,” Olem\nsaid with a grin.\nTamas heard his stomach growl. There must have been two pounds of\nmeat on that plate.\n“Share it with Gavril,” Tamas said. “I’m not hungry.”\nOlem cocked an eyebrow. “I can hear your stomach making bear calls\nfrom here, sir. You have to keep up your strength.”\n“Really, I’m fine.”\nGavril grabbed the meat with his bare hands. “Suit yourself.” He tore it\nin half and plopped one half back on the plate. He began to cram the rest\ninto his mouth. Around bites, he yelled out to another rider who’d just come\ninto camp.\n“Sir,” Olem said as Gavril strode off, “you need to eat.”\n“Get the men on their feet,” Tamas said. A sudden urgency rose within\nhim as a gust of wind nearly tore off his hat. “Have the advance column\nmarching out of the camp in twenty minutes.” He stared south until Olem\nwas gone.\nSixteen thousand Kez cavalry. His two brigades of infantry would be\nridden down. They’d die hungry, exhausted, and in a foreign land while the\nKez burned their homes.\nHe couldn’t let that happen.\nHe wouldn’t let that happen.\nTamas strode toward the nearest tents. “Companies,” he shouted.\n“Prepare for march!”\nSergeant Oldrich and his squad of Riflejacks were staying at a retired\nbarracks on the southeast side of the Ad River, not far from the Lighthouse\nof Gostaun.

Oh well. “Do you remember\na Privileged by the name of Borbador?” Adamat changed the subject.\n“I do,” Oldrich said. His normally pleasant face was suddenly guarded.\n“I think he’d do it for us. Borbador was one of the cabal’s best and\nbrightest. He held Shouldercrown against the Kez Cabal virtually by\nhimself. I know Tamas left him alive and has him stashed in the city. If we\ncould—”\n“No,” Oldrich said.\n“ ‘No’ what?”\n“Privileged Borbador has a gaes to compel him to kill the field marshal.”\n“I know. I’m the one who told Tamas about the gaes.”\n“Then why would you ask me that? Releasing him would endanger\nTamas and I won’t do it.”\nAdamat held his head in his hands. He felt like he was doing that a lot\nlately. “It’s our only chance against a Privileged under Lord Vetas.”\n“You could ask Taniel Two-Shot,” Oldrich said. “He kills Privilegeds as\na hobby, and rumor has it he’s in the city.”\n“Newspaper said this morning he left for the front.” Adamat realized his\nmistake as the words left his mouth.\n“So you have seen a paper?” Oldrich nudged a spittoon from beneath the\ntable with one toe, leaning over to spit into it. “Was there something in it\nyou wanted me to see?”\n“Sir,” one of Oldrich’s men called from the doorway. He was a young\nman, probably not much older than Adamat’s son Josep. “Sir, you should\nsee this.” He rushed over to Oldrich and dropped a paper into his lap.\nOldrich lifted the paper. The headline read, “Budwiel Sacked, Field\nMarshal Tamas Dead.” Oldrich was silent for several minutes as he read the\narticle. The young soldier stayed by his side the whole time. When Oldrich\nfinished, he handed the newspaper back to the soldier.\n“You weren’t going to tell me?”\nAdamat felt like a child who’d been caught robbing the pantry. “I was,”\nAdamat said. “After I figured out how to convince you to stay and help\nme.” Adamat swallowed hard. He was about to lose the last bit of help he\nhad to get Faye back. Once Oldrich was gone, it would be just Adamat with\neight children to look after, and a wife and son still in his enemy’s hands.\n“There’s no convincing,” Oldrich said. “I was given an order. Tamas is\nmy commanding officer and an old friend. He told me to see this thing\nthrough to the end regardless of whether he lived through the war.”\n“And you will?”\n“Yes.”"

He told me to see this thing\nthrough to the end regardless of whether he lived through the war.”\n“And you will?”\n“Yes.”\nAdamat couldn’t help but breathe a sigh of relief. He dabbed at his\nforehead with a handkerchief, realizing that he’d been sweating. “Thank\nyou.” He paused. “You seem to be taking this awfully well.”\n“The headline is sensational,” Oldrich said, pointing to the paper. “It’s\nactually ‘presumed dead.’ Tamas went behind enemy lines with the Seventh\nand Ninth and hasn’t been seen since. Those are the two hard-as-nails\nbrigades in the Adran army. Until I see a body, I’m going to believe that\nTamas is in Kez, chewing up their army and spitting them out like\ntoothpicks.”\n“So I won’t be able to convince you to release Privileged Borbador with\nTamas dead?”\n“Sorry. You’ll have to think of something else. And do it quick, because\nI can only help you take down Vetas until there’s an army knocking on\nAdopest’s front door.”\nAdamat stood. “I’ll think of something.”\n“Also,” Oldrich said, “with Tamas presumed dead, that means the clerks\nwill tighten the noose on the checkbook he gave you. We’ll need money for\nbribes or supplies sooner rather than later. If you’ve got some money\nstashed away…”\n“I’ll see what I can do,” Adamat said. He reluctantly said good-bye to\nhis children and headed for the door, only to have Oldrich join him in the\nhallway. “Sergeant?”\n“I wanted to tell you something,” Oldrich said in a hushed voice. He\nglanced into the mess. “If only to make you feel a little reassured. I don’t\nwant you to worry about your children. The boys have taken a real shine to\nthem. Anyone finds us, comes in here looking for those kids, my boys’ll\nscramble ’em good, and they won’t be kind about it.”\nAdamat fought back the sudden tears in the corners of his eyes. “Thank\nyou,” he managed. “It does… it does mean a lot. Thank you.”\nAdamat got to his safe house by about one in the morning. He wearily\nclimbed the stairs to the apartment above the landlady’s, listening to the\ncreak of his boots on the old wooden steps. Had it really been five days\nsince he’d been here? He’d slept on a park bench, a hospice bunk, and a\nchair in a bar over the days since his meeting with the Proprietor as he\nplanned his next move on Lord Vetas.\nHe needed a bath.\nSouSmith sat next to a low-burning lamp on the sofa. The boxer looked\nup from a game of cards laid out in front of him, his brow furrowed.\n“Bloody worried,” SouSmith said.\nAdamat closed the door with a sigh. He was hoping he’d have a good\nnight’s sleep before having to face SouSmith. He felt like the pit. His body\nhurt, he’d had little sleep in ten days, and he needed a good meal.

He’d felt\nlike this only once or twice before in his life, back when Manhouch\nsucceeded his father and the commoners were restless and all police officers\nwere working eighteen-hour days.\nHe never thought he’d feel like that again. He thought he’d left it all\nbehind.\n“Sorry,” Adamat said.\nSouSmith looked back at his game. He moved one card on top of\nanother and pulled two off the table, setting them beside him on the sofa.\n“Look like pit,” SouSmith said.\n“Feel like it, too.”\n“Where you been?” His beady eyes searched Adamat’s face.\n“The Proprietor reeled me in.” Adamat limped over to a chair by the\nsofa and collapsed into it. “His boys worked me over all night before I got\nto see him. Turns out the whole thing was a big bloody mistake. Tossed me\nback out on the cobbles with ‘sorry.’ ”\n“You saw the Proprietor?”\nWas that worry in SouSmith’s voice?\n“I came as close as one gets. Sat in the same room with him behind a\nblack screen. Spoke to him through some knitting woman, like he’s mute or\nsomething.” Adamat frowned. Maybe the Proprietor was mute. Maybe the\nwoman wasn’t just a security measure but an interpreter. “Do we have any\nfood?”\nSouSmith jerked his thumb to a platter next to the sofa. Underneath the\ncover was a sandwich. The meat and cheese were warm, but it seemed like\nthe best thing Adamat had ever tasted as he collected it and sank back into\nhis chair.\nAdamat felt a little strength return as he finished the meal. “He wants the\nsame thing I want, it seems,” Adamat said between the final few bites.\n“Lord Vetas has been causing him trouble. The Proprietor’s boys only\npulled me in because we were following the same woman.” Adamat licked\nhis fingers clean. “But now that the Proprietor knows we’re after the same\nthing, it seems he’s content to just step back and let me go at Vetas. Which\nis a bloody shame, because I need his help!” Adamat heard his own voice\nrise as he finished the sentence, and he grabbed the platter the sandwich was\non and hurled it across the room. It clattered into one corner.\nSouSmith leaned back on the sofa, his game forgotten, watching\nAdamat.\n“I’ve never wanted to kill a man so badly as I do Lord Vetas,” Adamat\nwhispered. “I know where he is. I found his headquarters. I have a chance,\nand with the Proprietor’s help I could do it, and he just pushed me back on\nthe street.” He took a shaky breath. “I’m going to do something very\nfoolish, SouSmith, and I think you should walk away from me. Consider\nthis the end of your employment.”\nSouSmith’s eyebrows rose. “I’ll decide that.”\n“I’m going to blackmail the Proprietor.”\nSouSmith began collecting his cards in one hand.

But\nhe’d been hoping against hope that SouSmith would once again refuse to\nleave. That he’d stay by Adamat’s side and see this thing through.\nSouSmith fetched his jacket from the rack by the door. “Sorry, friend,”\nhe said, “I’ll die for ya, but the Proprietor won’t stop with me.”\nOf course. SouSmith had his brother’s family to worry about.\nThey shook hands, and Adamat heard SouSmith’s heavy step down the\nstairs and out the front door.\nAdamat fell back into his chair with his head in his hands.\nSouSmith was big and powerful and he was worth five men in a fight,\nbut he was also a friend. Adamat couldn’t afford to have friends. Not with\nwhat he was about to do.\nAdamat dragged himself to his feet just long enough to go find his bed.\nHe didn’t bother removing his clothes before he dropped into it.\nCHAPTER\n14\nT\naniel rubbed at his eyes and tried to remember what it felt like to sleep.\nFive times in three days he’d fought in a bloody melee on the front lines.\nFive times he’d been the last one to leave the earthen defenses when the\nKez proved too strong. Five times he’d been forced to make the long trek\nacross the corpse-strewn fields dragging the wounded and dying, furious\nthat they’d once again let the front fall beneath a Kez onslaught.\nHow many times could they retreat before the army was nothing but\ndead and wounded?\nTaniel paused to look to the south. Budwiel was getting farther away\nevery day. The front—or what had been the front until half an hour ago—\nwas about a quarter mile away and obscured in powder smoke. The Kez\nsoldiers were already leveling the earthworks and carting away their dead.\nThis last offensive had been a bad one. The infantry from the\nSeventeenth Brigade was mostly green and they’d broken and run before\nthe retreat was even sounded. Taniel wondered if there was a single man\nunharmed after that mess. The groaning of the wounded in the surgeons’\ntents made his skin crawl.\nHe found Ka-poel sitting by the fire next to their tent. She stared at the\ncoals, absently cleaning beneath her fingernails with the tip of one of her\nlong needles. A pot of water boiled over the flames. She looked Taniel over\nonce, then stared back at the fire.\nTaniel dropped to the ground next to her. His whole body hurt. He was\ncovered in countless cuts and bruises. A particularly nasty Warden had\nalmost done him in, and he had a clean slice across the side of his stomach\nto show for it.\nKa-poel stood silently and moved around behind him, where she began\nto pull him out of the jacket. He didn’t like when she undressed him—well,\nhe liked it, but he’d heard officers muttering about the impropriety of their\nrelationship already—but tonight he was far too tired to argue. She\nunbuttoned his shirt and cleaned his neck and torso with a hot, wet\nwashcloth.\nHe lay on his side while she stitched the wound on his stomach, wincing\nevery time the needle went in."

Yes.\n“I think Sabon was in charge of it. I wonder if he’s still up there. Pit, I\ncould use his help.” Taniel paused to think. Sabon’s face floated in front of\nhim, perfect teeth standing out against his black skin. Sabon was the only\none Tamas ever listened to. He’d taught Taniel to shoot. A good soldier; a\ngood man. “Damn it, I should have asked Ricard. Even if Sabon is with\nTamas, there had to be a couple other powder mages left in Adopest. We\nneed them on the front.”\nKa-poel finished the stitching and Taniel climbed to his feet. His shirt\nwas nearly black, stiff with dried blood. He smelled like a slaughterhouse.\nHe left it on the ground. Ka-poel would find someone to wash it for him. He\nfetched his one spare shirt from the tent and buttoned it up.\nHis tent was on the side of one of the mountain ridges that frames\nSurkov’s Alley. It meant he had to sleep at an incline, but he also had a\nvantage over most of the valley, and right now he watched the Wings of\nAdom camp. The Wings’ camp sat closer to the front than the Adran, and\nthey held the east side of the valley with their flank against the river.\nReports were that the Wings were holding their front every day, but were\nforced to withdraw when the Adrans retreated so that the Kez couldn’t flank\nthem.\nTamas would have been furious had he been here to see it, that the\nmercenaries were putting forth a better defensive than the Adran army.\nA pair of Wings brigadiers were making their way from their own camp\ntoward the big, white-and-blue command tent at the rear of the Adran army.\nA few other officers seemed to be heading in the same direction. A meeting,\nit seemed. If Tamas were here, Taniel would be at that meeting.\nA great many things were different with Tamas gone.\nNot far from the command tent was the mess tent. In most armies the\ncooking was done by soldiers for their company, or sometimes even their\nsquad. Here at the front, all the cooking was being done by one chef, or so\nthe rumor went.\nMihali.\nIt wasn’t hard to pick out the tall, fat figure making his way between the\ncookfires, checking on his small regiment of female assistants.

        "text": "command tent.\nSoldiers seemed to watch him everywhere he went. Some tipped their\nhats. Some saluted. Some just stared as he walked by, but Taniel didn’t\nwelcome the attention. Was he some kind of curiosity for them to gawk at?\nFor years he’d always felt at home in the army, but now, with Tamas and the\npowder mages gone, Taniel felt alone, a foreigner.\nHe wondered what he looked like to them. He smelled like the alley\nbehind a butcher, and he probably looked like one too. His body was\ncovered in nicks and cuts, his black hair singed from a powder blast\nyesterday, his face dirty and bruised.\nAnd he wondered what he was. He’d managed to escape serious injury\nin five hard, bloody fights. He’d been grazed by bullets seven times in the\nlast two days. He’d been inches from being run through on half a dozen\noccasions. Was he just that fast? Or something else?\nThat kind of luck didn’t happen. It was uncanny. Had it been like this in\nFatrasta? No, he’d never been in an ongoing fight this bloody. He\nremembered ripping a rib from the Warden in Adopest and wondered if this\nluck was somehow connected to his newfound strength.\nHe reached the command tent, ignoring the guard who asked him to\nstop.\nThe tent was filled. There were perhaps twenty officers inside—what\nseemed like all the Wings brigadiers and Adran generals and colonels.\nVoices were raised, fists being shaken. Taniel slipped along the edge of the\ntent, trying to make some kind of sense of the argument.\nHe caught sight of a familiar face and moved up through the crowd.\nColonel Etan was ten years older than Taniel. He was a tall man with\nwide shoulders and brown hair cut short over a flat, ugly face. Not that\nanyone would tell him that he was ugly. The grenadiers of the Twelfth\nBrigade were the biggest, strongest men in the Adran army and one word\nagainst their colonel would find you at odds with all two thousand of them.\n“What’s going on?” Taniel whispered.\nColonel Etan gave him a quick glance. “Something about…” He paused\nto look again. “Taniel? Pit, Taniel, I heard you’d joined us at the front, but I\ndidn’t believe it. Where have you been?”\n“Later,” Taniel said. “What’s the argument about?”\nEtan’s welcoming grin faded. “A messenger from the Kez. Demands that\nwe surrender.”\n“So?” Taniel snorted. “There’s nothing to argue about. No surrender.”\n“I agree, but some of the higher-ups don’t. Something has them scared.”\n“Of course they’re scared. They’ve been retreating from every fight! If\nthey’d hold the line just once, we could break these Kez bastards.”\n“It’s not that,” Etan said. “The Kez are claiming they have Kresimir on\ntheir side. Not just in spirit, either, but that he’s there in their camp!”\nTaniel felt his whole body go cold. “Oh, pit.”\n“Are you all right? You don’t look well.”\n“Kresimir can’t be there. I killed him myself.”"

I killed him myself.”\nEtan’s attention was now fully on Taniel. “You… killed him? I heard\nsome wild rumors of a fight on South Pike before it collapsed, but you…”\n“Yes,” Taniel said. “I put a bullet in his eye and his heart. Watched him\ngo down in a spray of godly blood.”\n“General Ket!” Etan shouted. “General Ket!” He grabbed Taniel’s arm\nand shoved his way through the assembled officers. They all scrambled to\nget clear of him—no one stood their ground before a grenadier of his size.\n“No, Etan…”\nEtan pulled him out into the opening in the middle of the room, where\nthe unfriendly faces of two dozen officers waited in tense expectation. “Tell\nthem what you told me,” Etan said to Taniel.\nTaniel was once again terribly conscious of his frayed, bloody clothes\nand dirty face. The room seemed to spin slightly, the air hot and close.\nHe cleared his throat. “Kresimir is dead,” Taniel said. “I killed him\nmyself.”\nThe clamor of voices made his head hurt worse than the sound of a\nmusket volley. He looked around, trying to find an ally. He saw General Ket\nin the group, but she was no friend of his. Where was General Hilanska?\n“Let him speak!” a woman shouted. Brigadier Abrax, of the Wings\nmercenaries. She was ten years younger than Taniel’s father with a face\ntwice as severe and short hair cropped above her ears. Her uniform was\nwhite, with red-and-gold trim.\nGeneral Ket took the sudden silence to sneer at Taniel. “You can’t kill a\ngod.”\n“I did,” Taniel said. “I watched him die. I fired two ensorcelled bullets. I\nsaw them hit. Saw him crumple. I was on that mountain when it began to\ncollapse.”\n“Oh?” Ket demanded. “Then how’d you get down?”\nTaniel opened his mouth, only to shut it again. How did he get down?\nThe last thing he remembered was cradling Ka-poel’s unconscious body as\nthe building they were in began to buckle and fall.\n“That’s what I thought,” Ket said. “The powder has gone to your head.”\n“He’s a hero, sir!” Colonel Etan said.\n“Even heroes can go mad! Provosts! Get him out of here! This meeting\nis no place for a captain.”\nTaniel was shoved to the side by someone, and he heard another voice\nsay, “Kresimir isn’t here! What kind of poppycock is that?”\n“I’ve seen him.”\nEverything went still. Taniel recognized that voice. General Hilanska.\nHilanska was still seated while everyone else stood. He wore his dress\nuniform, decked out in dozens of medals, the collar freshly starched, his\nempty left sleeve pinned to his chest. The general looked tired, his immense\nweight sagging over the edge of the chair, his face pulled down from\nweariness.\nHilanska went on, his voice deep and level. “You’ve all seen him! At the"

If any of you had bothered to listen, the Wings Privileged said he\nreeked of sorcery, more powerful than any they’d ever witnessed.”\n“That was only a Privileged,” Ket said. “Not a god.”\nHilanska struggled to his feet. “Call me mad, Ket. I dare you. Tamas\nbelieved Kresimir had returned. He believed Two-Shot here had shot him.\nBut the bullets weren’t fatal. Kresimir is, after all, a god.”\nKet regarded Hilanska warily. “And yet Tamas still led the Seventh and\nNinth behind the Kez lines to their deaths.”\n“He’s not dead,” Taniel said, feeling his blood rise.\nKet turned on him. “Says our dead field marshal’s whelp.”\n“Whelp?” Taniel’s vision went blurry. “I’ve killed hundreds of men. I’ve\nnearly held that damned line out there by myself the last two days. I feel\nlike I’m the only one who wants to win this war, and you call me a whelp?”\nKet spat at his feet. “You’ll take all the credit yourself? What an ego!\nJust because you sprang from Tamas’s loins doesn’t mean you have his\nskill, boy.”\nTaniel could barely think. He’d been on the front line every day fighting\nfor this? Rage took control of him. “I’ll kill you, you stupid bitch!”\nTaniel felt his muscles tense to leap at General Ket, when something\nstruck him in the side of the head. He staggered and tried to run at Ket.\nHands grabbed him, arms pulled him away. He was hit again in the head.\nThrashing and yelling, he was forced out of the command tent.\n“Taniel,” he heard Colonel Etan say in his ear, “calm down, Taniel,\nplease!”\nIt took the sight of a half-dozen sharpened pikes leveled at his face to\nbring Taniel back from the brink of rage. The provosts—Adran military\npolice—behind those pikes wore expressions that said they’d poke him full\nof holes in an instant.\n“That’s enough of that,” Etan said, pushing away a pike. He was able to\nget the provosts to back off a few steps.\nNow that the rage had passed, Taniel felt cold, weak. His whole body\nbegan to shake. Had he really just called Ket a bitch in front of the entire\nGeneral Staff? What had come over him?\n“Are you trying to get yourself killed?” Etan demanded. “I’ve heard\nrumors that there was a powder mage out on the front each of the last few\ndays, throwing himself into the teeth of the enemy like he wanted to die. I’d\nnever imagined it was you. You’ll be lucky to get off with a flogging for\nthis. Attacking General Ket!

It scared him\nworse than looking down the wrong end of a Warden’s sword. Was it the\nmala withdrawal? His powder?\n“Taniel…” Etan stared at him, and Taniel could tell there was genuine\nconcern in his eyes. “Taniel, you dragged me five feet before I managed to\nclock you in the side of the head. I’ve dropped men twice your size with\nthat punch, and I had to do it three times to even faze you. Pit, I’m twice\nyour size! I know that powder mages are strong, but…”\n“I’ll take full responsibility,” Taniel said. “Hopefully you’ll not be\nreprimanded.”\n“I’m not worried about me.”\n“Captain?”\nThey both looked up. General Hilanska stood over them. The provosts\nwere gone.\n“Colonel, I’d like a word with the captain in private, please.”\nEtan left them, and Taniel slowly climbed to his feet, unsure as to\nwhether he’d be able to stand but certain that General Hilanska might be his\nonly ally left in this camp. “Sir?” He swayed to the side and stumbled.\nHilanska caught him with his one good arm.\n“Ket wants your head,” Hilanska said.\n“I’d imagine.”\n“You know,” the old general said, “with Tamas gone, powder mages\ndon’t have any pull anymore. Some of the ranking officers seem to want to\npretend you never existed.”\nTaniel leaned his head back and looked up at the darkening sky. Some\nstars were beginning to show, and the moon glowed bright on the eastern\nhorizon. “Do you believe he’s dead?”\nHilanska began to walk, forcing Taniel to follow him on wobbly legs.\nTaniel’s hands were shaking a little less, now.\n“I don’t want to believe it,” Hilanska said. “None of us do, despite how\nthe others are acting. We all loved your father. He was a brilliant strategist.\nBut all contact was lost. We haven’t heard from any of our spies in the Kez\narmy for three weeks now. We have to face the facts. Tamas is likely dead.”\nIf Tamas was dead, so were Vlora and Sabon and the rest of the powder\ncabal and the Seventh and Ninth. Taniel felt his chest tighten. No tears.\nThere wouldn’t be any of those. Not for Tamas. But for him to be gone\nforever… “And Kresimir?”\n“Whatever you did to him, he survived it.”\n“What of this Mihali? This god-chef?”\nHilanska shrugged. “Your father seemed to think he was Adom reborn.”\n“And you?”\n“I don’t have any evidence either way. His cooking is amazing.\nSupposedly, he and Kresimir have some kind of a truce. Something about\nletting the mortals fight it out.” Hilanska spit out of the corner of his mouth.\n“I don’t like the idea that we’re being used in some kind of cosmic battle.”"

Things\nweren’t spinning anymore. “What can Ket do to me?”\n“She’s a general. You’re a captain. A roomful of people just watched\nyou try to kill her.”\n“I wouldn’t have killed her. And I’m not just a captain. I’m a powder\nmage.”\nHilanska said, “I know. Tamas kept you outside the rank system. If he\nwas still here, you would have gotten away with it. Ket is a good general,\nbut she has a narrow vision of things. Tamas knew that. You’re just a\ncaptain now, though.”\n“Who has been ordering the retreats along the front?”\nHilanska stopped and turned toward Taniel. “I have.”\n“You?” Taniel had to keep himself from stepping back.\nHilanska set his hand on Taniel’s shoulder, as a father might to his son.\n“We can’t hold them,” Hilanska said. “Up until you arrived, we had no\nanswer to those Black Wardens. They just cut right through the infantry like\nnothing I’ve ever seen. They’re faster and stronger than regular Wardens,\nand powder won’t ignite near them. Even with you here, we can’t hold the\nline.”\n“What about sorcery? The Wings have Privileged.”\n“Sorcery doesn’t do a thing to the new Wardens. It’s baffling, really. I\ncan’t imagine that the Kez Cabal would create something they might not be\nable to control.”\nTaniel mulled over that for a moment. His brain was starting to work\nagain. That seemed a good sign. The rage was becoming a distant memory.\n“Maybe they didn’t create them.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Well, we’ve never seen a Warden created out of a powder mage before.\nMaybe Kresimir did that. Maybe the remnants of the Kez Cabal have no\nsay.”\n“It makes sense.” Hilanska watched him for a few moments. “Where are\nyou sleeping?”\nTaniel looked up to the side of the mountain. “Have a tent set up there.”\n“I’ll get you a real room,” Hilanska said. “You need some sleep. Come\nfind me in an hour, and I’ll have something arranged. Now, though, I need\nto try to convince Ket not to have you hanged.”\nTaniel’s heart had finally stopped pounding. He felt deflated, ill. “Thank\nyou. General?”\nHilanska paused and looked back.\n“I’ve been turned down for more powder by a dozen different\nquartermasters. They claim we don’t have enough black powder and the\nGeneral Staff is rationing it. Is there really a shortage?” Taniel thought back\nto Ricard Tumblar. The union boss had mentioned something about the\nsupply demands from the front being unusually high.\n“It’s not as bad as all that,” Hilanska said quietly. “I’ll make sure you get\nwhat you need. Anything else?”\n“Yes.” Taniel hesitated, not sure if he wanted to know the answer to his"

Anything else?”\n“Yes.” Taniel hesitated, not sure if he wanted to know the answer to his\nnext question. “Are there any powder mages left in Adopest? I know Tamas\nwas training some new ones.”\n“They all went with him. Even the trainees.”\n“Pit. I’d hoped that Sabon was still here somewhere.”\nHilanska’s face fell and he let out a soft sigh. “You haven’t heard?”\n“Heard what?”\n“Sabon’s dead, my boy. Took a bullet from an air rifle to the side of the\nhead over a month ago.”\nHilanska patted Taniel on the shoulder and headed off into the night.\nIt was several moments before Taniel could manage to take another\ndeep, shaky breath. He looked at the sky again. The daylight was only a\nsliver on the western mountains now; the sky above, a blanket of brilliant\nstars on dark blue.\nSabon, dead. His mentor. His teacher.\nThat had to have shaken Tamas. Perhaps enough that Tamas had made\nmistakes.\nIf Sabon was dead, then maybe Tamas was as well.\nWas Taniel the last powder mage left in Adro? It seemed that way. The\narmy retreated more every day. Kresimir was alive, and demanding their\nsurrender. What could he do?\nFight.\nThe only answer.\nCHAPTER\n15\nT\namas stood in the stirrups, watching through a looking glass as Kez\nscouts crested the last hilltop between the Kez cavalry and Tamas’s two\nragged brigades of infantry.\nAfter a few more moments of examining the enemy scouts he sat down\nand handed the looking glass to Olem.\n“We’ll have about two-thirds of our men inside the forest by the time\nthey reach us.”\nBehind him, the Hune Dora Forest rose above the plains. The prairie up\nto the forest had been logged to the twig a century ago, but Hune Dora itself\nwas a barricade of trees, protected by royal decree and declared a national\nproperty of Kez. The terrain changed drastically here, as the rolling foothills\nof the prairie gave way to sharp mountain ridges that crept like mighty old\nroots toward the Amber Expanse.\nTamas suspected the difficulty in logging Hune Dora had as much to do\nwith the forest being protected as the king’s hunting practices.\nHe spurred his mount around and rode to catch up with the rear of the\ncolumn. The men marched at half-time as the elements of the column ahead\nof them adjusted from six abreast to four abreast in order to smoothly\ntransition to the forest roadway.\n“Colonel Arbor,” Tamas said as he joined the rear guard.\nColonel Arbor was ancient as army standards went. He was ten years\nolder than Tamas, and had long since lost most of his hearing and all of his\nteeth. Despite his age he could march, fight, and drink like a man of thirty, a\nfact he attributed to a glass of wine and fine cigar before bed every night.\nThe colonel walked beside the very last men of the rear guard, rifle slung\nover his shoulder like a common soldier, cavalry saber at his side.

The First\nBattalion of the Seventh Brigade was Tamas’s very best. It was no accident\nthey carried the rear.\n“Eh?” the colonel said.\n“I wish you’d ride.” Tamas nearly had to shout, just to be sure the\ncolonel would hear him.\nThe colonel flexed his jaw and popped out his false teeth into one hand.\n“Won’t do it,” he said. “My old bollocks hurt like the pit in a saddle.\nBesides, sir, we need horses for scouting.” He eyed Tamas and Olem’s\nmounts as if he thought they’d find better use with the rangers.\n“We’re going to have company in about fifteen minutes,” Tamas said.\n“You’ve the rear guard. I want a walking retreat. Steady and brave.”\nArbor cleared his throat and spit out a wad of phlegm. “Battalion!” he\nscreamed. Farther up the line, a captain jumped half a foot in surprise. “Fix\nsword bayonets! Interlocking windmill. Livers in ten!”\nThe orders were passed up the column by sergeants, though half the\nbrigade had probably already heard them. Arbor brushed his false teeth off\non his uniform jacket and then slipped them into his back pocket. “Wouldn’t\nwant them to get damaged in the coming melee.” He winked at Tamas.\n“Right.” Tamas urged his mount forward to join his powder mages\nfarther up the column. Behind him, Arbor’s battalion fanned out across the\nprairie, forming a half-moon shield around the rear of the column.\n“Sir!” Andriya turned to Tamas with a salute as Tamas rode up to the\ngroup. Five powder mages gathered around Andriya. They’d all spent the\nnight hunting and scouting, and looked like the pit, with bags beneath their\neyes. Tamas could smell the black powder hanging around them like a\ncloud.\nTamas reined in. “The Kez van is just over that hill. About twelve\nhundred dragoons coming on hard.”\n“We going to stay and fight?” Andriya asked. He had the same hungry\nlook he always did when it came time to shed Kez blood.\n“No,” Tamas said. “The van will be here about an hour before the rest. I\nwant us to be well into the forest by that time. Don’t worry,” he added upon\nseeing the disappointment on Andriya’s face. “We’ll have plenty to kill.”\nHe looked over the field of battle—for it was that. No doubt now that\nblood would be shed within the hour. He examined the tree line and the\ncontour of the land, then the old stone walls of the abandoned city of Hune\nDora. With more time to plan—a day, or even a few hours—he’d have been\nable to set up a trap and exterminate the Kez vanguard. As it was, he needed\nhis men off the plains.\nHe pointed to where the forest rose sharply from the prairie. “Andriya, I\nwant your team a few hundred yards out from the tree line.

Vlora, put yours\non those rocks over there.” He pointed to the north. “As soon as they’re\nwithin range, take horses off the front. Try to stumble the whole column.\nWhen they spread for a charge, kill their officers. Dismissed.”\nThe powder mages scattered at a run. They’d be in place and begin\nfiring within a few minutes. It might buy his brigades a little extra time to\nget into the forest.\nHe’d placed his powder mages at high points to be able to make long\nshots, but the road itself fell into a wide, flat gully before rising once more\ninto the trees. The Kez vanguard would have an easy charge.\nJust inside the forest, the Seventh’s Fourth Battalion had taken up firing\npositions. They’d give the First Battalion some cover if it came to a sprint\ninto the woods.\nTamas whirled his horse to face northwest, toward the forest, then\ndismounted. He cracked a powder charge between his fingers and sprinkled\nsome on his tongue. He felt the powder trance take hold.\n“Carbine,” he ordered.\nOlem, who had been shadowing him silently this whole time, handed\nhim a loaded carbine. Tamas lowered himself to one knee. The carbine was\na shortened rifle, able to be fired and be reloaded on horseback easier than a\nlong rifle, but it was still best to fire dismounted. Instead of an elongated\nstock to hold it steady, it had a steel handle attached to the barrel.\nTamas gripped the carbine tightly and lined up his shot on the horizon.\nHe watched as the dragoon scouts drew closer.\nA Kez dragoon was typically armed with a carbine, one pistol, and a\nstraight sword. The older Kez commanders treated them as mounted\ninfantry—that is, they rode horses but fought on foot. Younger commanders\nutilized them as light cavalry.\nThe current scenario would see them firing carbine, then pistol, and then\nmaking an open charge with the hope of breaking Tamas’s rear guard.\nTamas was willing to bet his horse on the tactic.\nIt wasn’t long until the main company of the Kez vanguard breached the\nfar hill. Tamas breathed out gently, sighting down his carbine. The dragoons\nwere a little over a mile away and still in formation at four abreast. The\nhorsehair on their spiked cavalry helmets waved in the wind, jostling as\nthey rode.\nTamas heard the crack of a rifle come from his left and knew Andriya\nhad taken the first shot. Several long seconds passed, filled with the reports\nof rifle fire.\nThe first dragoon stumbled. The horse fell, twisting as it went down.\nAnother, then another fell. They slammed into the road in a cloud of dust.\nThe horses immediately behind the front line became entangled and many\nof them went down, tumbling and thrashing beneath the hooves of their\nown allies.\nTamas didn’t have to hear the screams of the horses for them to echo in\nhis head.\nThey had to have known Tamas had his powder mages, yet they’d kept\nclose formation. Tamas wanted to shake his head at the mistake. The\ndragoons should have been ready for it.\nBut then again, who is ready for a bullet to take them when the enemy is"

The\ndragoons should have been ready for it.\nBut then again, who is ready for a bullet to take them when the enemy is\nonly a dot on the horizon?\nHe pulled his trigger.\nA few seconds later his bullet entered a horse’s eye. The beast jerked\nand fell. The rider went up and over his horse, hitting the ground hard\nenough to break his neck.\nTamas handed Olem his carbine and took a loaded one in its place.\nThe Kez column spread out from the road, widening their formation.\nMore came over the hilltop. Tamas’s initial elation at seeing a dozen\nbrought down so quickly disappeared. He had twelve hundred more to deal\nwith. Tripping up a few at the head of the column was hardly a victory.\nHe searched the breadth of the dragoons for an officer’s epaulets. He\nfound them quickly and rested his carbine against his shoulder. A deep\nbreath. Let it out. Squeeze the trigger.\nThe bullet caught the young officer in the throat. He was thrown from\nthe saddle, and Tamas was instantly on to the next target.\nFor the next couple of minutes, his powder mages fired at will, each\nbullet finding a deadly mark with few exceptions. The Kez vanguard drew\ncloser.\n“Better mount up, sir,” Olem said, not a hint of nervousness in his voice.\nTamas could read the dragoon formation. They spread on the eastern\nside of the road in columns six deep. They would hit the First Battalion’s\nflank, driving them away from the possible protection of the city of Hune\nDora’s walls. The dragoons would strike hard and fast, avoiding\nentanglement, and be back out of range of conventional musket fire within a\nfew moments. They would be able to pull back around behind Hune Dora’s\nwalls, shielding them from powder mages, and then sweep an attack against\nthe column’s flank.\nTamas saw carbines lifted to shoulders. He swung up into his saddle and\ncleared the barrel of his carbine.\n“Watch the wall,” he said to Olem. “Let’s go.”\nArbor’s First Battalion slowed to a crawl. Every other man suddenly\nstopped, whirled, and lowered to one knee. Tamas could hear Arbor scream\nthe order to fire, and a cloud of powder smoke rose in the air. Fifty or more\ndragoons fell. The soldiers leapt to their feet, reloading as they resumed\ntheir march.\nTamas galloped toward the rear guard and drew his curved cavalry saber.\nThe dragoons let loose with their carbines, leaving their own clouds of\npowder smoke like a memory behind them.\nThe line of soldiers staggered. Some fell, some limped along, crying for\nhelp. None of them broke to tend to the wounded.\nThey’d been trained well.\nThe dragoons holstered their carbines in the saddle. Pistols were drawn,\naim taken.\nThe second line of Adran soldiers turned, knelt, and fired.\nA cloud of smoke went up from the dragoons as they returned shots with\ntheir pistols.

Their sword bayonets\nwere fixed on the ends of their muskets, making the weapons long enough\nto act as pikes. Tamas cursed. Their formation was too loose…\nThe dragoons’ thunderous charge was upon Tamas’s soldiers.\nHorses screamed as they were impaled upon sword bayonets. Men fell\nfrom their mounts. Adran soldiers were cut about the neck and face by\nstraight-edged cavalry swords. The lines of infantry and cavalry met,\ndisappearing in a bloody tangle.\nTamas leaned forward, urging more speed out of his charger, Olem right\nbeside him. Across the field of battle, opposite him where the old walls of\nHune Dora turned around a hill, another cavalry charge appeared.\nGavril was at the head of these cavalry. Two hundred cuirassiers in the\ndark-blue pants and crimson coats of the Adran heavy cavalry raced across\nthe prairie just as the tattered remains of the Kez dragoons extracted\nthemselves from the First Battalion.\nThough still outnumbered three to one, Gavril’s cuirassiers hit the\ndragoons with the force of an artillery shell. The collision was audible, the\nyells of the dragoons turning desperate at the sudden appearance of an\nenemy at their flank. Somewhere in the midst of the tangle a Kez trumpet\nbelted out a desperate retreat.\nA moment later and Tamas hit the fray himself. He swung his cavalry\nsword out and across, neatly severing the carotid artery of a Kez dragoon.\nHe whirled in the saddle, barely catching the sword strike of another\ndragoon. He reached out with his senses and detonated a powder charge in\nthe dragoon’s breast pocket and immediately urged his charger forward,\nlooking for the next target.\nThe last of the dragoon vanguard extracted themselves and fled back\ntoward their brigades.\nA cheer went up among Tamas’s men. It carried from the First Battalion\ndown the column and on to the Ninth Brigade, which was already safe\ninside the forest.\nTamas caught his breath as his charger picked its way through the bodies\nof men and horses to join Gavril. “Rein in your cuirassiers,” Tamas shouted\nto Gavril. Gavril nodded and gave the orders.\n“The main body of cavalry will be here in an hour,” Tamas said,\ngasping, his heart still pounding, the powder smoke stinging his eyes and\nreminding him that he was an old man.\nGavril brought his mount close to Tamas and lowered his voice. “What\nwill we do with the dead and wounded?”\nTamas examined the field of battle. There were at least a thousand dead\nand wounded, counting the Kez and Adrans together. The Kez couldn’t\nhave retreated with more than three hundred of their men. There was no\nway Tamas could march with his wounded.\n“Arbor!” Tamas said, searching. “Olem, find Arbor.”\nA few moments later, the old colonel joined him on the field.

He’d seen action\nhimself, it seemed.\n“Sir?”\n“Status of the First Battalion?”\n“Fine and kicking, sir. We gave ’em pit. No exact count yet, but I lost no\nmore than two hundred men.”\nTwo hundred men from Tamas’s best battalion. Almost a fourth of them.\nIt was a staggering victory against almost twelve hundred dragoons, but\nTamas couldn’t afford to lose a single man, let alone two hundred of his\nvery best.\n“Pack up your wounded. Send them up the column. Strip the battlefield\nof everything useful.”\n“Permission to slaughter the horses, sir?” Arbor said. “We need the\nmeat.”\n“Granted. Give your men a battlefield burial. I wish we had more time,\nbut I mean to be off this prairie when the rest of the Kez get here.”\nArbor gave a brisk nod and headed off, giving orders.\n“A battlefield burial, sir?” Olem asked.\n“Something we did on the march in Gurla. When another army pressed\non us after a fight, we’d wrap our dead in their canvas tents with their\nnames marked on the canvas and hope the enemy had the decency to give\nthem a proper burial.” Tamas sighed. He didn’t like battlefield burials. The\ndead deserved more respect than that.\n“Did they?”\n“What?”\n“Did they give them a proper burial, sir?”\n“Four times out of five… no. They’d leave them to rot in the Gurlish\nsun.”\nTamas swung out of his saddle and knelt down beside a wounded Adran\nsoldier. The man stared into the sky, teeth clenched, his knee a bloody mess.\nA single glance told Tamas that the leg would most likely have to be\namputated. Until then, how to move the man at all? Tamas drew his knife\nand held the handle to the wounded man.\n“Bite down on this,” he said. “It’ll ease the pain a bit. Olem, have a few\nboys check the city. Maybe there are some abandoned wagons. Gavril, have\nyour men catch any of the unwounded Kez horses. We might need them.”\nHe looked toward the southern horizon. Soon enough, fifteen thousand\ncavalry would breach that hill.\nIt took four whole days of searching and over a thousand krana in bribes\nbefore Adamat found where Field Marshal Tamas had stashed Borbador, the\nlast living Privileged from Manhouch’s royal cabal.\nIt was funny, Adamat decided, that he was using the field marshal’s own\nmoney to try to undo his orders.\nColonel Verundish stood beside him. She was a smart-looking Deliv\nwoman in her fifties, her ebony skin a complement to the dark blue of her\nAdran uniform, with straight black hair tied back.\n“He’s here?” Adamat asked.\n“He is,” she confirmed.\nThey stood on a bluff at the very northernmost district of Adopest,\nwhere the rows of houses abruptly gave way to farmland.

If Adamat survived long enough to retire, maybe\nhe could move his family out here.\nVerundish nodded down to the manor below them. The grounds were\novergrown, most of the windows broken, the walls vandalized. Like so\nmany other manors belonging to the nobility, it had been gutted by Tamas’s\ntroops of anything of value and then opened to the public after the\nexecution of its former owner.\nAdamat followed Verundish down from the bluff and entered the manor\ngrounds by a back gate. The sorry state of the place made Adamat sad. He\nhad no love of the nobility, not by any stretch, but many of these manors\nhad been architectural works of art. Some had been burned to the ground,\nsome crushed to rubble for their stone. This one had got off lightly with\nmere vandalism.\nThey entered through the servants’ quarters and made their way to the\nsecond floor. Adamat counted two dozen men and women, all soldiers by\ntheir look. They wore greatcoats over their uniforms, despite the summer\nheat, and each one gave Adamat a cursory glance as he went by.\nA glimpse of a chevron over a powder horn told Adamat that these were\nRiflejacks—more of Tamas’s best soldiers.\nVerundish stopped outside the last room toward the rear of the servants’\nquarters. “You’ve got five minutes,” she said.\n“What will you do with him?” Adamat asked. “Now that Tamas is\ndead?”\nThe colonel’s lips curled into a scowl. “If Tamas is dead—we’ll wait for\nhis generals to return to Adopest and hand him over to them. They’ll decide\nhis fate.”\n“Tamas isn’t in danger from him anymore.”\n“I don’t care what you think you know, Inspector,” Verundish said. “The\nfield marshal slaughtered the cabal for a reason, and this man is its last\nliving member. Now go on.” Verundish lifted a pocket watch in one hand\nand looked down at it. “Your five minutes is ticking.”\nAdamat opened the door and slipped inside.\nPrivileged Borbador sat tied to a chair in the corner of the room. His feet\nwere bound tight against the posts of the chair, his hands locked in stiff iron\ngloves that would prevent his fingers from moving. He looked comfortable,\nfor all the tightness of the ropes. He was thinner than the last time Adamat\nhad seen him, and his chin sported a full-grown beard. In front of him was a\nstand, like the kind that musicians used to hold their music. Bo looked up\nfrom it.\n“Bo,” Adamat said, taking his hat in his hands.\nBo cleared his throat. “Yes?”\n“My name is Adamat. We met a few months ago at Shouldercrown.”\n“Inspector. Yes. I remember you. You’re the one who brought my gaes\nto Tamas’s attention.”\nAdamat grimaced. “I’m sorry. I was working for him.”\n“You’re not anymore?”\n“Well, the rumors are that he’s dead.”\nBo stretched his neck out and tilted his head from side to side. It was\nabout the only part of him he could move. He didn’t respond."

Not much, but just enough to give Adamat his\nanswer. The gaes was still in place. Tamas was alive. And Bo hadn’t told\nthe soldiers guarding him.\n“Interesting,” Adamat said aloud.\n“Think you could turn the page for me?” Bo nodded at the stand in front\nof him.\nAdamat moved around to see a book propped on the stand. He obliged\nby turning it to the next page and then smoothing the page out with one\nhand.\n“Many thanks. I’ve been staring at that one page for about half an hour\nnow.”\nAdamat asked, “How strong is the compulsion to kill Tamas?”\n“Why do you ask?”\n“Could you resist it? He’s quite far from here. Could you resist the\ncompulsion to go looking for him?”\n“For a time,” Bo said. “Yes. It’s only six months since Manhouch’s\ndeath. I think I have a year until the gaes kills me.”\n“Two minutes!” Verundish called from the hallway.\nAdamat lowered his voice. “If I get you out, will you help me?”\n“Help you do what?”\n“I need to rescue my wife and kill a man who is a threat to this entire\ncountry.” Adamat had no idea if Bo was a patriot of any kind, but the\naddendum sounded good.\n“What is this, some kind of pulp novel?” Bo smirked at him.\n“It’s very serious, actually.”\nBo’s smirk dissolved. “Why do you need my help?”\n“The man I need to kill has over sixty men guarding him—one of them\nis a Privileged.”\n“Really, now? You work for Field Marshal Tamas—who is reported as\ndead—and you’re going after a man who’s kidnapped your wife and has the\nkind of resources to have sixty enforcers and a Privileged at his disposal?”\nAdamat could practically sense Bo’s desire to flex his fingers. “Have you\never thought of getting out of the investigating business?”\n“You don’t know the half of it,” Adamat said.\n“Get me out of here and I’ll spend a week as a mime in the King’s\nGarden,” Bo said, “whatever you want.”\nAdamat regarded the Privileged for a moment. Was he in any shape to\nfight another sorcerer? Adamat knew a Privileged needed gloves to do his\nmagic, to protect his hands from being burned by the Else, but there was no\nsign of Bo’s. Could a Privileged even be trusted?\n“All right,” Adamat said. “I’ll do what I can.”\nVerundish opened the door. “Time is up, Inspector.”\nAdamat followed Verundish back out of the servants’ quarters. She\nstopped him once they’d reached the edge of the manor grounds. “You can\nfind your own way back?” she asked.\n“Yes.” Adamat examined her for a long moment.

He would have guessed her as the military type\neven without the uniform—her back was straight, her hands clasped behind\nher like a soldier at ease.\nThis was a great risk he was taking, but he had no other choice if he\nwanted to free Borbador—and then Faye.\n“I need Privileged Borbador,” Adamat said.\n“Pardon?” Verundish was just turning to go. She stopped and looked\nback at him.\n“I need you to free him.”\nVerundish cleared her throat. “That’s not happening, Inspector.”\n“Name your price. Field Marshal Tamas is dead. Let Bo go and you and\nyour men can join the defensive at Surkov’s Alley. Or leave the country.\nThat might be the best idea, with what I’ve heard from the front.”\n“That”—her words were angry, clipped—“is treason.”\n“Please,” Adamat said. “Privileged Borbador is my only chance to save\nmy wife—maybe even to save this country. Free, he’s of value. Under\nguard, he just ties up you and your men.”\n“You should go now, Inspector,” Verundish said.\nAdamat let out a small sigh.

You have a week.”\nCHAPTER\n16\nT\naniel walked among the corpses on the battlefield and wondered how\nmany had died that day.\nA few hundred? A few thousand?\nSurgeons, thieves, the families of soldiers—they all picked their way\namong the bodies, finding the wounded first and getting them back to their\nrespective armies before bothering to stack the dead into carts like so much\nfirewood, then taking them to be buried in mass graves.\nThere were always far more wounded than dead. That’s how it always\nwas, even when sorcery was involved. At least, that’s how it was\nimmediately after a battle. Over the next week well over half of the\nwounded would die. Even more would end up crippled for life.\nHe’d picked a horrid profession, Taniel reflected.\nWell. Not so much “picked.” There’s no picking your profession when\nTamas is your father. Taniel couldn’t think of a time when he didn’t want to\nbe a soldier. Vlora, the girl he’d thought was the love of his life, wanted to\nbe a soldier, too. So Taniel had gone along with his father’s wishes and\ntrained to be a powder mage. It was the only life he’d ever known.\nAnd now Tamas, Vlora, Sabon, and everyone else who’d ever\ninfluenced Taniel in his youth were all dead and gone.\nTaniel tried to shake the weight of that thought from his shoulders and\nkept walking.\nSoldiers weren’t supposed to come onto the battlefield after a skirmish\nlike this. The temporary truce after each battle that allowed either side to\ncollect their own dead and wounded was tentative enough without armed,\nhot-tempered men taking to the field.\nThat didn’t stop some of them from coming.

She looked up\nat him briefly before lifting the dead man’s left hand and using her long\nneedle to pick something out of the man’s chewed fingernails. What was it?\nHair from a Kez officer? Blood of someone still alive? Only she knew.\nTaniel didn’t really expect an answer. She’d been less than\ncommunicative lately, even for her.\nShe moved to the next body. Taniel followed, watching as she cut a bit\nof bloody shirt off a dead Kez officer.\nTaniel had left his jacket and weapons back at camp. No need for anyone\nto know he was out here. Regardless, some of the Adran surgeons gave him\nrespectful nods. Others a respectful distance.\nHe lifted his eyes to the Kez camp. Where was Kresimir? he wondered,\na little thrill of fear working up his spine. The god was lying low. Unseen.\nEven when Taniel opened his third eye, there was no sign of the\noverwhelming glow of power that should surround a god.\nAt this point, Taniel worried more about being killed by the Kez than\nabout falling into the god’s hands.\nThe Kez marched forward every day. Sometimes only a few hundred\nfeet. Other times as much as a quarter mile, but always a little closer to\nAdopest. Eventually the valley would open up into the Adran basin and the\nKez would use their hugely superior numbers to surround the Adran army\nand strike at several cities at once. They’d ravage the countryside, and Adro\nwould be forced to capitulate.\nWhat would Tamas have done?\nBah. Tamas would have held the damned line. That’s all the Adran army\nneeded to do: keep from losing their front every damned day.\nAll Taniel could do was fight. He couldn’t keep the generals from\nsounding a retreat, even when he felt the Kez about to break and run. He\ncouldn’t hold the whole thing by himself.\n“That stuff you gather,” Taniel asked as Ka-poel rose to her feet, “is it\njust from men who are alive?”\nShe nodded, depositing something into one of the tiny leather bags in\nher satchel.\nEven the living left a bit of themselves behind on the battlefield. Blood,\nhair, nails. Sometimes a finger or bit of skin. Ka-poel gathered it all up and\nstored it for later.\nTaniel jumped a little at the sudden crack of a musket, but it was just the\nsound of a provost shooting a looter. He licked his lips and looked at the\nKez camp again. What if Kresimir was out here, walking among the dead?\nWhat if he saw Taniel? Knew who he was? What he’d done?\n“I’m going back to camp,” Taniel said. He looked over his shoulder\nseveral times on the long walk back, watching Ka-poel continue to pick her"

        "text": "“I’m going back to camp,” Taniel said. He looked over his shoulder\nseveral times on the long walk back, watching Ka-poel continue to pick her\nway among the bodies.\nDinner was being served as Taniel worked his way through the camp.\nQuartermasters were returning to their companies with rations of meat,\nkettles of soup, loaves of bread. Far better fare than soldiers usually saw on\nthe battlefield. Taniel could smell the food, making his mouth water. This\nchef, Mihali, god or not, created incredible dishes. Taniel didn’t know that\nbread could have the swirls of flavor and buttery softness that this stuff did.\nTaniel stopped at his room. General Hilanska had found him a shed to\nbed down in. It wasn’t much, but it was private. He snatched his jacket,\nslipping a few powder charges into his pocket, then hesitated at his belt. He\nshould be able to wander his own camp without fear, but something told\nhim to go armed. Perhaps just paranoia. Or maybe it was the idea that\nGeneral Ket’s provosts were still looking for him. Why they’d not found\nhim yet was anyone’s guess.\nTaniel buckled the belt, with two pistols, around his waist.\nHe’d only taken a few steps from his tent when a soldier accosted him.\n“Sir!”\nTaniel paused. The soldier was a young man, maybe twenty-five. Still\nolder than Taniel himself. A private in the Eleventh Brigade, by his\ninsignia.\nWhen Taniel didn’t answer, the soldier went on hesitantly. “Sir, the\nfellows and I, we were wondering if you’d do us the honor of joining us for\ndinner. It’s all the same food, sir, and the company is good.” He held his\nflat-top forage cap in both hands, wringing it.\n“Where?” Taniel asked.\n“Just right over there, sir.” The soldier perked up a little. “We’ve got a\nfifth of Doubin rum, and Finley plays the flute something fierce.”\nTaniel couldn’t help but feel suspicious. He set a hand on one of his\npistols. “Why are you so nervous, soldier?”\nThe soldier ducked his head. “Sorry, sir, I didn’t mean to bother you.”\nHe turned to slink away, obviously distraught.\nTaniel caught up to him in just a few quick steps. “Doubin rum, you\nsay?”\n“Aye, sir.”\n“Horrid shit. That’s the stuff sailors drink.”\nThe soldier’s forehead wrinkled in a frown. “It’s the best we can do, sir.”\nThere was a flash of anger in his eyes.\nThey both stopped in the middle of the path, the soldier still holding his\nhat. He glared at Taniel now. Taniel could imagine what was going through\nhis head: Damned officers. Think they’re so high and mighty. Plenty of good\nstuff to drink at the officers’ mess. Won’t sit with a soldier, not for a\nmoment.\n“What’s your name, soldier?”\n“Flint.”\nNo “sir” on the end of that. Taniel nodded, as if he’d not noticed. “I got\na taste for Doubin rum on the ship from Fatrasta. Haven’t tasted it all"

I’d be honored, if you’d have me.”\n“You mocking me?”\n“No,” Taniel said. “Not a bit. Lead on.”\nFlint’s frown slowly began to slide. “This way, sir.”\nIt wasn’t more than twenty yards to Flint’s fire. There were two men\nbeside the fire, keeping Mihali’s soup warm in an old iron pot. One had a\nlarge nose, crooked off to the side from not being set after breaking, while\nthe other was a short, round man practically bursting from his uniform. The\none with the nose froze at the sight of Taniel, a spoon lifted halfway to his\nmouth.\n“Captain, sir,” Flint said, gesturing to the two men by the fire. “The one\nwith the nose there is Finley. Ugliest man in the Eleventh. And that round\nbit of meat there is Faint, on account that she fainted the first time she fired\na musket. Finley, Flint, and Faint. We’re the fellows of the Eleventh\nBrigade.”\nTaniel lifted his eyebrows. He’d not in a hundred years have guessed\nthat Faint was a woman.\n“Fellows, this is Captain Taniel Two-Shot, hero of the Fatrastan War and\nthe Battle for South Pike.”\nFaint seemed skeptical. “You sure this is Taniel Two-Shot?”\n“That’s him, all right,” Finley said. “I was with Captain Ajucare when\nwe went after the Privileged at the university.”\n“I thought you looked familiar,” Taniel said. “I never forget a nose.”\nFlint laughed and punched Finley in the arm. Finley fell off his chair,\nand Taniel heard himself chuckle. It was a raspy, nasty sound, like an\ninstrument desperately in need of tuning. How long had it been since he’d\nlaughed?\nFlint fetched a folding cloth chair and brought it to Taniel. Finley poured\nthem each a pewter tin of soup, and then bread and mutton was passed\naround.\nThey ate in quiet for several minutes. Taniel was the first one to break\nthe silence. “I heard the Second took a beating a couple of weeks ago.”\n“Aye,” Flint said. “That we did.”\n“We were on the wall,” Faint said. “The wall in Budwiel when the Black\nWardens came over.”\nFinley stared quietly into his soup.\n“Faint here,” Flint said. “She punched one of those Wardens in the nose\nwith that ham fist of hers. Knocked him right off the bulwark.”\n“I’d imagine that gave him quite the shock. I heard it was bad,” Taniel\nsaid. “I’m glad to see you got out.”\n“Most weren’t so lucky,” Finley said quietly. Flint and Faint’s smiles\ndisappeared.\nTaniel cleared his throat, looking around. Usually a squad would eat\ntogether. “All that’s left of your squad?” he asked as respectfully as he\ncould.\nFaint chuckled. Finley pushed her. “It’s not funny,” Finley said.\n“It’s a little funny,” Faint said."

Finley pushed her. “It’s not funny,” Finley said.\n“It’s a little funny,” Faint said.\nTaniel wondered whether to smile at the joke. “What?”\n“Not our squad, sir,” Flint spoke up. “This is all that’s left of our\ncompany.”\nTaniel felt his mouth go dry. A company was usually about two hundred\nmen. To lose all but three…\n“No wounded?” he asked.\n“Probably,” Faint said. She ladled herself another tin of soup. “But not\nthat we’ve seen. This deal with the Kez, where we clean up our own dead\nand wounded after each battle, only came about after Budwiel. We left\nBudwiel at a run. Left behind supplies, ammunition, weapons… loved ones.\nEveryone who couldn’t run is now a slave, or worse.”\n“What’s worse than being a slave?” Flint asked.\nFinley looked up from rolling a cigarette. “Where do you think they\nkeep getting those Wardens? Why torture and twist your own people if\nyou’ve got prisoners?”\n“It takes years to make and train a Warden,” Taniel said.\n“Does it?” Finley asked. He lit his cigarette with a burning stick from\nthe fire. “Rumors are going around the men, rumors that they’ve got\nKresimir himself in the camp.”\nFlint shook his head. “If they had Kresimir, we’d all be dead.”\n“We’ve got Adom reborn,” Faint said. She held up her mutton and\nbread. “Mihali is keeping Kresimir from destroying us all.”\nFlint rolled his eyes. “Come on, now.”\n“There’s another rumor,” Finley said. He looked up, meeting Taniel’s\neyes across the fire. “There’s a rumor Taniel Two-Shot put a bullet in\nKresimir’s eye, and now Kresimir wears a mask that covers half his face—\nand it don’t have no eyehole in it.” He leaned over, offering his smoking\ncigarette to Taniel.\nTaniel took a long drag at the cigarette. Nasty things, he’d always\nthought, but he made exceptions for nights like this, when it was more\nabout camaraderie than habit. “I heard a rumor,” he said, coughing and\nturning his head toward Flint, “that there was Doubin rum at this fire.”\n“Now that”—Faint pointed at Taniel—“is fact.” She retreated to her tent\nfor a moment and came back with an earthen jug. “Get your flute, Finley,”\nshe said. “I’ve had enough of this dark talk.”\nTaniel was offered the jug first. He took a sip of the stuff and felt his\nwhole body shudder. “Gah,” he said, wiping his mouth on his sleeve.\n“My da works for Doubin and Company,” Faint said, taking the jug.\n“Tastes like a demon’s own piss, don’t it!” She threw back the jug, taking a\nlong, hard drink.\nTaniel leaned back, watching the fire, unable to keep from laughing\nwhen Flint spat a mouthful of the rum into the fire and the flames flared up\nmomentarily.\n“Don’t waste it!” Faint shouted, nabbing the jug.\nIt didn’t take more than a few more passes before Taniel could feel the"

His body loosened and his mind became\nbleary. He leaned back and watched the fire, and before long Finley began\nto play his flute.\nIt was a low, mournful sound. Not at all the kind of shrill dance Taniel\nhad heard from that kind of instrument before. It didn’t take long until Faint\nbegan to sing. Her voice, much to Taniel’s surprise, was a clear tenor that\ncut through the night.\nHe found himself drifting in his own mind. The aches in his body\ndissolved and the front seemed a hundred miles away.\nThere was a rustle of sound, so very slight he could have imagined it,\nand then Ka-poel slid into his lap. Just like that. No asking or hesitation, but\nas quick as a long-familiar lover. Taniel would have been uncomfortable if\nhe didn’t already feel so warm. Content. Happy, even.\nTaniel drifted for what seemed like hours, and woke with a shiver. He\ndidn’t know how long he’d been gone, but the sun had set and the starry sky\nspread out above them. Had he dreamed that moment of contentment?\nNo.\nFlint stared into the red coals. Finley was putting away his flute, and\nFaint snored softly on the ground beside the fire. Ka-poel was nestled in the\ncrook of Taniel’s arm. Her eyes were closed, a small smile on her face.\nTaniel lifted his free arm and brushed a bit of red hair from her forehead.\nIt was growing back after the fight on the mountain, and it seemed a deeper,\nmore vibrant red than before.\nTaniel felt eyes upon him. Flint was watching.\n“She’s a pretty little thing,” Flint said.\nTaniel didn’t answer. He didn’t trust himself to. Words like impropriety\nand savage went through his head, but they didn’t have the bite they usually\ndid. What did those things matter? He might die tomorrow.\n“Thank you,” Taniel said to Flint, “for inviting me.”\n“It was our pleasure, sir. Not often soldiers get to dine with a hero like\nyou.”\n“No hero. Not me. Just a man with nothing but rage in his heart.”\n“If you really had nothing but rage in your heart, that girl wouldn’t be\nsleeping there sound as can be,” Flint said. He winked at Taniel, and Taniel\nfelt his cheeks grow warm.\n“I should warn you, sir,” Flint said.\n“Yes?”\n“The provosts are looking for you. Rumor is General Ket wants to hang\nyou.”\nTaniel scoffed. “If they were looking for me, they could have found me.\nI’m on the front line every day.”\n“They don’t want to arrest you in front of the men. You’ve saved a right\nlarge number of soldiers every day on the line. The men aren’t sure whether\nyou’re a demon or an angel, but they think you’re watching over them—\nfighting while the senior officers sit farther back and watch us die.

There\nmight be a riot if they arrest you on the line.”\n“It’s not hard to find my room,” Taniel said, glancing toward the little\nshed he and Ka-poel were staying in.\n“The provosts are questioning around all quiet-like. They’ve asked us a\ncouple times.” Flint shook his head with a little smile. “Everyone tells them\nto look on the front.”\nTaniel picked at a bit of gristle stuck between his teeth. So, the infantry\nwere watching his back. It made him feel sad, more than anything. He\ndidn’t deserve to be looked out for. He was only on the front because he\nknew nothing but killing. Not because he wanted to save the soldiers.\n“Then I have something else to thank you for.”\n“Don’t thank me, sir,” Flint said. “Just keep looking out for us out there.\nNo one else is.”\n“I’ll try.”\n“Also, sir, avoid the Third. General Ket’s brigade love her. Don’t know\nwhy, but her men are loyal, and they might just turn you over to the\nprovosts themselves.”\nTaniel shifted Ka-poel’s weight on his shoulder and climbed to his feet,\nbalancing her in his arms. She didn’t respond to the jostling except to\nnuzzle her face closer to his neck. It was a feather’s touch, soft and warm,\nand Taniel felt his body react to it.\n“Good night, Flint,” he said.\n“Good night, sir.”\nTaniel carried Ka-poel back to their shed. He laid her down in his bed\nand covered her with a blanket before pulling a powder charge from his\npocket.\nHe stared at the charge for several moments. A small hit of the powder\nand he’d see better in the dark. He wouldn’t have to light a lamp. It wasn’t\nlike he was sleeping these days anyway. How long had it been? Two weeks\nsince a proper night’s sleep? Could humans exist like that? He felt wooden\nand sluggish, as if walking in a dream.\nBut when he had a bit of powder, he was as alive and awake as always.\nTaniel took a pinch of the powder and raised it to his nose. He stopped.\nLowered it and rewrapped the powder charge. He found a match and struck\nit, touching it to the lamp beside the bed. The shed was suddenly thrown\ninto the light.\nHe got his rifle out from beneath the bed and began to clean it. The\nprocess calmed him, let him think. He pulled his mind away from Ka-poel,\nlying there in his bed, and away from the provosts and General Ket, and\naway from his father’s death and the Kez army’s inexorable push into Adro.\nTaniel finished with the rifle and cleaned his pistols, then wrapped a few\ndozen powder charges. He looked at that powder. He needed it. Wanted it.\nHe didn’t let himself take any.\nHis bayonet was last. He took it out of its leather wrappings and\nexamined it in the light of the lamp. There was a bit of dried blood in one of\nthe grooves. He picked it off, then polished the metal.

He felt the bed move\na little and looked up.\nKa-poel lay on her side, one hand resting on her hip, the other propped\nbeneath her head. She watched him with those green eyes. Her shirt had\nridden up a bit and he could see the ashen freckles at her waist and the sharp\ncurve of her hips. He felt his heart beat faster.\n“I have to kill Kresimir,” Taniel said. “For good this time. But I don’t\nknow how to do it.”\nKa-poel moved to the edge of the bed. She leaned over, reaching\nbeneath the bed, and opened her satchel. She fished around a little bit before\ncoming back up with a doll.\nTaniel swallowed hard. The doll had been shaped from wax into the\nperfect resemblance of a person. Gold hair, a handsome face, stout\nshoulders, and almost feminine lips. Taniel knew that face. He’d seen it on\nthe man who’d stepped out of a cloud after descending from the heavens.\nKresimir.\nShe’d never seen Kresimir. At least, so he thought. How could she know\nwhat he looks like?\n“I don’t think even your magic is strong enough to kill a god,” Taniel\nsaid. “I shot him with two redstripes.”\nKa-poel touched a finger to her chin thoughtfully. She slowly drew the\nfinger down her throat and then over her shirt, between her breasts. It\nstopped, then back to her throat. She made a cutting motion, then spread her\nhand.\n“Blood?” Taniel asked, his throat dry.\nShe nodded.\n“Kresimir’s blood?”\nAnother nod.\n“I’ll never get close enough.”\nShe mouthed a word. Try.\n“You want me to throw myself at a god, hoping I can draw his blood?”\nKa-poel swung her legs around to the edge of the bed. She took the\nbayonet out of his hands and set it on the bedside table. She lowered herself\ninto his lap, legs straddling his own.\n“Pole, I don’t…”\nShe put a finger to his lips. He remembered the mala den back in\nAdopest. With her pressed firmly against him in the hammock, her face so\nclose. He shuddered.\nKa-poel put two fingers to her lips, then pushed them against his\nforehead. She mouthed a word.\nIt wasn’t spoken, but still seemed to echo in his mind.\nSleep.\nSleep.\nHe felt his back hit the bed and his eyelids shut, suddenly weighty as\nmillstones.\nSleep.\n“Why are you courting Lady Winceslav?” Nila asked.\nThe centerpiece of the dining room of Lord Vetas’s city manor was a\nlong ironwood table that could seat sixteen.

Jakob sat on his left,\nand Faye sat beside Nila.\nWhen Nila was a girl, she used to dream of attending fine dinner parties,\nadmiring her reflection in the polished silverware and drinking from a\nwineglass rimmed with gold.

        "text": "admiring her reflection in the polished silverware and drinking from a\nwineglass rimmed with gold. She never imagined that dream would turn\ninto a nightmare.\nFor ten days now they’d been eating with Vetas every evening. Despite\nthe normal bustle and the number of men around the house—upward of\nsixty some days—dinnertime was always quiet. He used the time to instruct\nNila in proper dining etiquette, and to shower Jakob with compliments,\npraise, and gifts. Nila hated every minute of it. Vetas filled every moment\nwith mundane chatter, going on with some instruction or asking them all\nquestions about themselves.\nNila knew better than to take this as some kind of friendliness. Vetas was\nprying. Finding out new things about them and filing them away in that\ninsidious mind of his.\nHe never let anything slip about himself, of course. He was a master at\ndeflecting questions. Which was why Nila was surprised when he answered\nhers.\n“Lady Winceslav,” he said, “owns the Wings of Adom mercenary\ncompany. You’ve heard of them, I trust?”\n“Everyone has,” Nila said. She glanced at Faye. The housewife sat stiff\nin her chair, staring at the empty place setting beside Jakob. Each of the last\nten nights, that place had been occupied by her son, Josep, a boy of fifteen\nor sixteen, who was missing the ring finger of his right hand. Tonight that\nchair was empty.\n“Most everyone, yes,” Vetas said. “Right now they are employed against\nthe Kez army. I’d like to employ them elsewhere.”\nNila moved the food around on her porcelain plate. She didn’t want to\nbe here. Didn’t want to look at Vetas’s soulless face anymore. “And that’s\nit? They’re mercenaries. Can’t you just… hire them?”\n“That’s it,” Vetas said. He gave her a tight smile.\nThat wasn’t it, of course. There was some other reason why he was\ncourting the Lady. Perhaps he wanted to hire the mercenaries as well, but\nhis plans couldn’t be that simple. Nila didn’t care. She just wanted dinner to\nbe over. It wouldn’t be, though. Not until Vetas said it was.\n“You want to use her,” Nila said.\n“Hmm?” Vetas lifted his wineglass to his lips.\n“For whatever all this is about.” Nila gestured down the table. Aside\nfrom the place settings here at one end, the table was covered with papers—\ncorrespondence, receipts, lists; everything involved with Lord Vetas’s\naffairs. She’d read a few, when she’d gotten the chance. None of them\nseemed to mean anything.\nVetas smiled at Jakob. “The Lady Winceslav is an eligible widow and a\nvery intelligent woman. She’d make a wonderful wife.”\n“A wife?” The word came out in a burst of laughter. Nila covered her\nmouth, petrified at the outburst.\n“Yes,” Vetas said, as if he’d not heard the disbelief in her voice. “A\nwife.” He leaned toward Jakob. “You understand that every lord needs a\ngood wife, and it’s important to marry someone with connections.”\n“Yes, Uncle Vetas.”\n“Good child.”"

Someday the nobility will return, and\nwhen it does, you will be at their head.”\nNila ceased moving the fork around her plate. This was the first she’d\nheard Vetas say anything about the nobility. She’d always assumed that\nJakob, in his capacity as next in line for the crown, fit into Vetas’s plans\nsomehow, but he’d never spoken of it.\nShe waited for Vetas to go on. Instead, Vetas took a sip of his wine.\nFaye was still staring at the empty place setting across from her. She’d\nbegun to rock back and forth slightly, her mouth hanging open, her forehead\nwrinkled.\n“You’re just using everyone,” Nila said. “Me. Jakob. Lady Winceslav.”\nWhat is your plan? Nila wanted to shout. Why are you in Adopest?\nVetas looked slightly surprised. “Of course I am. That’s what nobles do.\nBut,” he said, reaching over and patting Jakob affectionately on one hand,\n“it’s all for your protection. The duty of the nobility is to protect the people,\nno matter what kind of distasteful things they have to do.”\nNila slammed her hand down on the table, making Jakob jump. “Don’t!”\nshe said. She gripped the lip of the table to keep herself from shaking.\n“Don’t what?” Vetas asked innocently.\n“Nila,” Jakob said, “why are you shouting at Uncle Vetas?”\nVetas gave Nila that tight smile again.\nShe would have snatched up her knife and leapt at Vetas then and there\nif Faye hadn’t spoken.\n“Where is my son?”\nVetas’s fingers drummed once on the table. His attention shifted from\nNila to Faye. “Nila,” he said without looking at her, “I think that you should\ntake Jakob to his room, now.”\n“Isn’t there dessert, Uncle Vetas?” Jakob asked.\n“Of course, my child. I’ll have some brought up to you. Run along.”\nNila still wanted to grab that knife and leap at him. She waited,\ncontemplating, wondering if she could move fast enough. “Jakob,” she said,\ngetting up from her chair and holding out her hand. “Come along.”\nShe took Jakob upstairs and put him in his room, helping him get out a\nnumber of toys before going into her own room and rushing out into the\nhallway, stepping carefully to avoid the creakiest boards, until she reached\nthe servants’ stairs that descended into the kitchens. She descended halfway\ndown the stairs and pressed her ear to the wall.\n“… was burned down,” Vetas was saying calmly, his voice muddled\nthrough the plaster. “There were eleven graves.

It was followed by the low sound of crying.\nFaye.\nVetas went on as if he hadn’t noticed Faye’s reaction. “I won’t have time\nto go up and investigate it myself, but it seems as if your children are all\ndead.”\n“Where is my son?” Faye demanded. The crying dried up, followed by a\nfew sniffs.\n“I’ve also received reliable word that your husband has been imprisoned\nby Tamas. It seems that he confessed to being blackmailed, and the field\nmarshal plans on having him executed for treason.” Vetas’s voice droned\non, as if he were talking about the weather. “My contacts within Sablethorn\nare few enough, but I should have better information within a week or so.”\n“Where”—the table rattled as if someone had pounded it with a fist—“is\nmy son?”\nVetas said, “With your husband arrested, you and your son are of no use\nto me anymore. I’ll keep you around for another couple of weeks, but I’ve\nsold your son to the Kez. He’ll be smuggled—”\nThere was a sudden scream and then a crash. The walls rattled once, and\nthen there was silence. Nila held her breath. Had Faye attacked Vetas? Had\nshe succeeded?\nThe silence dragged on. Nila thought she could hear the labored sound\nof heavy breathing coming from the dining room.\n“That,” Vetas said, “was not very smart.” The dining room door opened,\nand Vetas spoke to one of his men. “Take her downstairs. I’ll join you\nshortly.”\nHeavy footsteps entered the dining room. The sound of a struggle\nresumed.\n“I’ll kill you, bastard!” Faye said. “I’ll take your eyes! I’ll take your\ntongue! There won’t be anything left when I’m done!” A slew of curses and\nscreams followed Faye out of the dining room and soon became muffled as\nshe was carried into the basement.\nNila listened for several minutes before hearing Vetas leave the dining\nroom. His soft, measured footfalls traveled down the hall, and the basement\ndoor opened. Nila counted to one hundred before she descended the\nservants’ stairs into the kitchen.\nShe looked around quickly. The kitchen had been rearranged since she\nwas last here. She brought a stool over to the washbasin and got on it,\nrummaging around in the high cupboards. Nothing. She swore under her\nbreath and got back down. There, under the sink. Back in reach of children.\nShe snatched the large jar of lye and set it on the kitchen table. It didn’t\ntake long to find an empty spice pot. She blew the leaves of spices out of\nthe bottom and poured half a cup of lye into it.\n“What are you doing?”\nNila nearly dropped the lye jar. She looked up.\nPrivileged Dourford stood in the doorway. His height and Privileged’s\ngloves made him imposing, and all the house staff knew his temper.\n“Just getting some lye, my lord,” Nila said.\n“For what?”"

But make sure that boy\nis asleep. That damned harpy is going to get what’s coming to her tonight,\nand it’ll be hard to keep her quiet.” Dourford rummaged in the cupboards\nuntil he found half a loaf of bread and left the room, chewing thoughtfully.\nNila put the large lye jar back and tucked the spice pot into her dress\npocket. She returned to her room, wondering how hard it would be to\npoison both Vetas and Dourford at the same time.\nCHAPTER\n17\nA\ndamat was wary as his hackney cab pulled onto the long suburban street\nthat led to his house.\nHe hadn’t been there for almost two months—not since the day he told\nVetas that Field Marshal Tamas was on his way to arrest Arch-Diocel\nCharlemund. Adamat had been forced to trick Vetas and still almost gotten\nTamas killed. Vetas would want Adamat back—either dead or alive.\nAdamat was willing to bet that Vetas was having the house watched.\nHe kept an eye on the street on the approach to the house. No suspicious\nmen, no figures lurking in windows with an undue interest in his home.\nFoot traffic was minimal in this part of town, just a family heading to the\nmarket and a single old man strolling briskly in the sun.\nThe carriage rolled to a stop three houses down from his own. Adamat\nchecked the snub-nosed pistol in his pocket. Loaded and primed.\nHe flipped the collar of his jacket up around his face, pulled his hat low,\nand stepped into the street. Handing a few krana to the driver, Adamat\nheaded warily toward his house, his cane held firmly in one hand.\nThe shutters were closed, the blinds drawn as he’d left them. Adamat\nsearched the front of the house for any sign that things had been touched or\ntampered with. Nothing.\nAdamat opened the gate to the alleyway between houses and went back\nto his garden. Another short inspection showed him nothing out of order. He\nwaited for several minutes, examining the house again and again. No new\nscratches on the lock, no footprints in the garden.\nIt slowly began to dawn on him that perhaps he wasn’t as important to\nVetas as he thought. Lord Vetas was playing some kind of larger game on\nbehalf of his master, Lord Claremonte. Did Adamat matter anymore? After\nall, as far as Vetas knew, Tamas had had Adamat quietly executed for\ntreason. What if Vetas had written Adamat off entirely? Maybe Faye and"

Maybe Faye and\nJosep were already dead, buried in a shallow grave somewhere.\nAdamat clenched and unclenched his fists. No. He couldn’t think like\nthat. Faye was alive. Vetas still held her. And Adamat was going to get her\nback.\nAdamat unlocked the back door and stepped into the house. He closed\nhis eyes and took a deep breath. The rooms were warm and stuffy with the\nwindows closed up, but it still smelled like old wood, books, dust, and a\nslight hint of lavender from the incense Faye used to burn. He drew his\npistol and carefully searched each of the rooms.\nEverything was just as it had been left: the bloodstains on the sofa and\ncarpet from one of Lord Vetas’s men, a bullet hole in the ceiling. Another in\nthe hall and one in the floor, along with the rest of the unrepaired damage\ndone in the fight with the Black Street Barbers.\nPistol in one hand, cane in the other, Adamat climbed the stairs to the\nsecond floor. Here was where the Barbers had attacked him. There was\nSouSmith’s blood, almost black on the dark hickory stairs.\nNo one upstairs. No sign anyone had gone through his belongings or\nsearched the house.\nAdamat sighed and lowered the pistol. He was almost disappointed. It\nwas as if Lord Vetas had forgotten him entirely.\nHe put his cane in the umbrella stand by the front door and headed to the\nkitchen. There might be some canned beans or something to eat in the\npantry. Get some food, then find his shovel, and then…\nAdamat was not nearly fast enough to react as something swung around\nthe corner and took him full in the nose. Pain blossomed all over his face\nand he was suddenly blinking up at the ceiling through tears.\nSomeone towered over him. He was grasped by the lapels of his jacket\nand lifted off the ground and a moment later slammed into the wall. Adamat\nswallowed a mouthful of his own blood and tried to breathe through his\nnose, only to utter a whimper.\nAdamat was held against the wall by two strong arms. He batted at them\nto no effect, then lifted his hand to wipe his eyes. He looked into the face of\na man with coal stains on his cheeks and shirt. Adamat recognized this man\n—one of Lord Vetas’s goons.\nAdamat cleared his throat and tried to sound casual. “Kale, was it?”\n“That’s right.” The coal shoveler’s mouth twisted. “Been waiting for you\nfor a long time.”\nAdamat’s whole head hurt. His nose had to be broken. He probably\nlooked an absolute mess. The second set of clothes ruined in a week.\n“Lord Vetas wants a word with you,” Kale said. “You come along\nquietly now, or I start breaking your teeth.”\nWhere the pit had he come from? Adamat had checked the whole house.\nMan must have been hiding in the cellar. And what on earth had he hit\nAdamat with? A cudgel?\n“Right,” Adamat said.\nKale’s grip loosened.

        "text": "Adamat with? A cudgel?\n“Right,” Adamat said.\nKale’s grip loosened. Adamat felt himself slide down the wall until his\nfeet were touching the ground. This man was fast. And strong. Pit, what\nAdamat would have given to have SouSmith here now.\n“Clean yourself up,” Kale said. He let go of Adamat’s jacket.\nAdamat felt his knees give out from beneath him and he collapsed to the\nfloor. He’d landed on something. Just under his chest—his pistol. He\nwrapped his fingers around the butt blindly.\nHe felt a strong hand on his back. “I’m all right,” Adamat said. “Just.\nHurts. I’ll get another shirt from my bedroom and then I’ll come, no fight.”\nHis words were gurgled and nasal.\nHe pushed himself to his feet with some struggle. Pit, the pain in his\nface. It would take more than three fingers of whiskey to dull this. Adamat\ntook three steps down the hall and turned, lifting the pistol, and pulled the\ntrigger.\nThe sound of the gunshot made his head—somehow—hurt even more.\nKale regarded the pistol, then looked at Adamat.\nAdamat looked at the pistol, then at Kale. Then at the floor.\nThe bullet was on the ground. It must have fallen out of the barrel when\nAdamat dropped the pistol.\nKale crossed the space between them in two long strides, knocking the\npistol out of Adamat’s hand and grabbing Adamat by the throat, lifting him\ninto the air and slamming him against the front door. The walls rattled from\nthe impact.\nAdamat struggled to breathe. He kicked. He punched. Nothing he could\ndo would loosen Kale’s grip.\n“That’s going to cost you a thumb,” Kale said.\nAdamat flailed around with his right hand. He had to do something, he\nhad to… he felt his hand touch the head of his cane where it sat in the\numbrella stand. He gripped the cane as far down as he could, lifted it, and\nslammed it into Kale’s temple.\nKale staggered to one side, letting up on his grip. Adamat shoved him\naway with one arm and brought the cane down as hard as he could.\nThe coal shoveler caught the blow with one hand even as he stumbled\naway from Adamat. He grabbed the end of the cane and jerked.\nAdamat found himself in a sudden tug-of-war. Kale jerked again, almost\npulling Adamat over. Adamat could see the coal shoveler’s eyes tighten at\nthe corners and knew he’d not keep ahold of the cane the next time.\nSo Adamat twisted the head of the cane. There was a quiet click.\nKale yanked hard on the cane. He tumbled to the ground and looked\nwith some surprise at the end of the cane in his hand.\nAdamat threw himself forward, cane-sword-first, ramming the short\nblade into Kale’s stomach. He pulled back and rammed again, then again.\nAdamat stumbled to one side after the final thrust, staring at Kale.\nThe coal shoveler stared back. He held both arms across his stomach,\nwhimpering from the pain.\n“He’ll know,” Kale said. “Lord Vetas will know you’re back, and he’ll\nkill your wife.”"

My boy?”\n“Get me a doctor,” Kale said. “Do it now and I’ll tell you about your\nboy.”\n“My next-door neighbor is a doctor. Tell me and I’ll fetch him.”\nKale let out a long, anguished sigh. “Your boy… your boy is gone. They\ntook… I don’t know where, but he’s gone. Your wife is there… she…”\n“She what?”\n“Get me a doctor.”\n“Tell me.” The pain in Adamat’s head seemed to climb to a crescendo. It\nwas agonizing, and by the look of his soaked shirt and jacket he must have\nlost a great deal of blood from his nose.\n“Vetas… he’ll know. He thought maybe Tamas took you in… that you\nwere arrested, or shot… but now he’ll know you’re alive.”\nAdamat gritted his teeth. “Not if they don’t find the body.” He barely\ntrusted himself to thrust straight and true, but his cane sword went into\nKale’s eye and only stopped when it hit the back of his skull. He pulled it\nout and waited until the body stopped twitching before he cleaned the blade\non Kale’s coat.\nAdamat stripped to the waist and and tossed his bloody clothes onto\nKale’s body. He hunted about the house for any other sign that the coal\nshoveler had ever been here, then went and found his shaving mirror.\nHis bleary eyes and bloody face stared back at him. He barely\nrecognized himself.\nAdamat’s nose was bent nearly perpendicular to his head. Every gentle\ntouch as he probed his face forced him to choke down a scream.\nHe put one hand on either side of his nose and stared at himself in the\neyes. It was now or never.\nHe grasped his nose and straightened it.\nAdamat woke up on the floor of his kitchen to the sound of someone\npounding on his front door. He slowly got to his feet and glanced in the\nmirror. Through all the blood and grime he could tell his nose was straight\nagain. He wondered if it was worth the excruciating pain that even now\nmade him want to collapse.\nIt took him a full minute with shaking hands to reload his pistol. When it\nwas primed, he went to the front door and peeked out the window.\nIt was one of his neighbors. An older woman, stooped from age and\nwearing a day dress with a shawl hastily thrown over her head. He didn’t\nthink he’d ever learned her name.\nAdamat cracked the door.\nThe woman nearly screamed at the sight of him.\n“Yes?” he asked.\n“Are you… are you all right?” she asked in a trembling voice. “I thought\nI heard a gunshot, and then not five minutes ago came the most terrible\nscream.”\n“Gunshot? No, no gunshot. I’m terribly sorry at my appearance. I fell\nand broke my nose. I was just setting it. Probably the scream you heard.”\nShe stared at him like he was some kind of specter. “Are you sure you’re\nfine?”"

No need to do that.”\n“Now, now, I must insist.”\n“Madame!” Adamat made his voice as firm as he could. It made his\nnasal passage vibrate, and the pain nearly dropped him to the floor again.\n“If you mind, I will attend to myself. Do not, under any circumstance,\nsummon a doctor.”\n“If you are certain…?”\nDamned busybodies. “Quite, thank you, madame.” Adamat closed the\ndoor and surveyed the mess in his hallway. Blood everywhere. The rug, the\nfloor, the walls. All over the door behind him.\nIt took Adamat several hours and quite a lot of Faye’s spare linens to\nclean up all the blood. He worked urgently—no telling if another of Vetas’s\ngoons would arrive at any time. But he had to have the house cleaned out.\nThere had to be no sign that he’d ever been here.\nWhen it was done, Adamat finally cleaned himself. A full bottle of wine,\nand the pain in his head was a dull hum instead of a constant hammering.\nNight had fallen. He wrapped Kale’s body in the soiled linens and dragged\nit out the back door, thinking how furious Faye would be once she found\nout what he’d used the linens for.\nIn the corner of Adamat’s small garden was a toolshed, and under the\ntoolshed an unused root cellar no larger than the inside of a small carriage.\nAdamat entered the root cellar and felt around in the dark for several\nminutes before he found what he was looking for: a rope on the cellar floor\nin a layer of loose dirt. He grabbed the rope and hauled, pulling free a stout\nwooden box.\nHe took the strongbox into the garden and returned to drop the body\ninside the root cellar. He rearranged the tools so it looked like no one had\nbeen in there for some time and closed the door behind him.\nInside the lockbox was every krana he’d saved since he first found out\nhe owed Palagyi for the loan that had started Adamat and Friends\nPublishing. Adamat didn’t trust bankers anymore. Not since his loan had\nbeen sold to Palagyi.\nThe sum came out to a little under twenty-five thousand. Not enough.\nNot nearly enough.\nAdamat spent another several hours cleaning the house of all traces of\nblood and then gathered a travel case full of children’s clothes, the\nstrongbox, and his cane and pistol before he headed out into the street to\nlook for a hackney cab.\nTaniel lay against the earthen battlements and glanced up at the overcast\nsky.\nMountainous white clouds moved ponderously through the sky, rolling\nlike foam on top of a wave as it crashed upon the beach. Bits of gray mixed\ninto the clouds, here and there. Rain, maybe? He hoped not. The earthworks\nwould turn to mud and the rain would foul powder on both sides."

The earthworks\nwould turn to mud and the rain would foul powder on both sides.\nTaniel could hear the distant drumming of the Kez. It seemed far away,\nfrom where he lay against the cool, hard earth. The shouts of the Adran\ncommanders—those were closer. He wanted to tell them to stuff it. Every\nman on the line knew they’d likely die today. Every man on the line knew\nthat the Kez would succeed in their attack, taking the earthworks again like\nthey did yesterday, and the day before that.\nMorale wasn’t just dead; it had been hanged, shot, then drawn and\nquartered and buried in a rocky grave.\n“Well?” Taniel said.\nColonel Etan stood a few feet back from the edge of the earthworks,\nwaving his sword and lending his own reassurances to the meaningless\nchatter of the officers. He wore a bearskin hat with a purple plume, befitting\nan officer of the Twelfth Grenadiers. His eyes were fixed on the\napproaching Kez infantry, still well beyond the earthworks.\n“Coming,” Etan said.\nTaniel scanned the clouds. “Wake me when they get here.” He closed his\neyes.\nSome of Etan’s grenadiers chuckled at that. Taniel opened his eyes to\nsee who’d laughed, and flashed them a grin. He surprised himself at how\neasily he smiled. Just a few days ago the very act had seemed foreign.\nNow…\nHe caught sight of Ka-poel back behind Etan. She sat on the earthworks,\nher knee raised up, chin in her hand. She was watching the Kez advance.\nEven the grenadiers—the strongest, bravest men in the Adran army—had a\nwild, nervous look in their eyes. They knew what it meant to be on the\nfront. But Ka-poel’s eyes were thoughtful, piercing. Not a hint of fear. She\nlooked as deadly as a Fatrastan wildcat.\nTaniel wondered what she saw that the others didn’t.\n“Getting close,” Etan said. His body was tense and he kept a white-\nknuckle grip on his sword.\nTaniel wondered where Kresimir was. Why hadn’t the god shown\nhimself? Why hadn’t he killed them all, scattering them with sorcery,\ninstead of letting his army chip away slowly at the Adran defenses day after\nday?\n“Here they come!”\nTaniel gripped his rifle in both hands. The timing for this had to be\nperfect. No hesitation. He had to—\n“Now!”\nThere was just a hint of a shadow in the corner of Taniel’s eyes. Taniel\nthrust his rifle upward, ramming two and a half spans of steel straight up\nbetween the legs of a leaping Warden.\nTaniel felt the rifle stock twist in his hands. He gave a shout and pushed\nup harder, lifting the Warden like some kind of macabre trophy and then\nslamming him onto the earthwork floor.\nEven a Warden could be taken by surprise, it seemed. The creature lay\nstill in utter shock for several moments, eyes wide, a look of panic on his\nface. Then it began to thrash, trying to pull off the bayonet that Taniel had\nrammed up its ass."

It only\ntook a few moments before all that remained of the Warden was a bloody\nmess of meat. Taniel pulled his bayonet out of the dead creature just as the\nAdran line opened fire.\n“Get rid of it,” Etan said. He and a pair of his men grabbed the dead\nWarden and hefted it over the earthworks, letting it roll down to the field\nbelow.\nThe advancing Kez wavered in the onslaught of musket fire. Hundreds\ndropped to the ground, but the Kez war machine marched right over them.\nThey dropped their bayoneted muskets into a ready position and charged at\na run.\nTaniel got up on the earthworks and fired his rifle, dropping a Kez major\nfrom the back of his horse.\nEtan stepped up beside Taniel. “It’s been a pleasure knowing you, my\nfriend,” he said, eyes on the charging Kez.\n“We’re not losing today.” Taniel rammed a cotton-wrapped bullet down\nhis rifle, then cracked open a powder charge with his thumb. He snorted the\ncharge in one long drag and rubbed his nose with the back of his hand. “Not\ntoday,” he said. Then, louder, “We’re not losing today.”\nTaniel felt a rising wave of anger. Why should they lose? Why should\nthey turn and run? They were better than the Kez. The Adran army was\nfeared all over the Nine.\nHe turned toward the grenadiers. “Are you Field Marshal Tamas’s men?\nAre you?”\n“The field marshal is dead,” someone said.\nTaniel felt the spittle fly out of his mouth. “Are you?”\n“I’m the field marshal’s man!” Etan lifted his sword. “Dead or alive, I’ll\nalways be!”\n“Are you?” Taniel screamed at the grenadiers.\n“Yes!” They answered with one voice, muskets raised.\n“The Adran army—Tamas’s army—doesn’t lose. You can flee if you\nwant”—Taniel pointed at the grenadiers—“when the trumpet sounds. Run\nback to those armchair generals, let the Kez shoot you in the back. But I’ll\nbe here until the Kez break.”\n“So will I,” Etan said. He swung his saber.\n“And I!” the grenadiers shouted in unison.\nTaniel turned back to the Kez. “Send them to the pit!”\nTaniel saw his father’s face float before his vision like a tattered flag. He\nsaw Vlora, and Sabon and Andriya, and all the rest of his fellow powder\nmages. He could see his friends in the Seventh and Ninth. Then they were\ngone, and the world was drenched in red as Taniel felt his legs carry him\nover the edge of the earthworks and straight into the teeth of the Kez\ninfantry.\nThe crack of muskets and blasts of artillery were suddenly lost in the\nthunder of the charging infantry.

He smacked the\nofficer across the chin with his rifle then stabbed an infantryman.\nThe Kez were all around him and he felt a sudden panic. It didn’t matter\nhow quick or how powerful he was, he could be felled by sheer force of\nnumbers, just like the Warden he and the grenadiers had hacked apart.\nTaniel saw a bayonet aim at his heart. He dropped his shoulder and felt\nthe point snag his jacket, ripping clean through, then slammed his fist into\nthe soldier’s face.\nAnd suddenly Taniel was not alone. Adran grenadiers with their\nbearskin hats and crimson-cuffed jackets were beside him, muskets at the\nready to push back the Kez assault.\n“Shove!” Etan’s voice rose above the din. “Step! Thrust! Shove! Step!\nThrust!”\nWhile the Kez infantry threw themselves forward with reckless abandon,\nthe Twelfth Grenadiers moved in lockstep, every man chosen for his\nimmense size and trained to meet the enemy unflinchingly.

Taniel knew\npower. He knew speed. But the pure strength of these grenadiers working\ntogether shocked him. He felt the rhythm of their push deep down in his\nchest.\nA Kez soldier threw himself over the line, crashing into Taniel and\nsending him back. The grenadiers closed up the empty spot, not missing a\nbeat. Taniel wrestled with the soldier, throwing him to the ground and\npressing his boot to the man’s throat.

He flew, a few moments of\nuncontrolled tumble sending his heart lurching before he hit the ground,\nbouncing off an infantryman’s body. The jolt sent Taniel’s rifle sliding from\nhis hands, and when he came to his feet, he was unarmed.\nThere wasn’t time to react. This new Warden was too fast. A heavy fist\npummeled his face, sending him spinning.\nTaniel righted himself, bracing for another blow. Mentally, he touched a\nbit of powder. There was no reaction. This was a Black Warden.\nThe next blow failed to land as the Warden thrashed about, Ka-poel on\nhis back. She hung on by one of her long needles, which was buried deep\ninto the meat of the creature’s shoulder. She’d missed his spine by inches,\nand the needle could do nothing but infuriate him.\nTaniel drew his boot knife. He squared his shoulders, ready to leap,\nwhen the Warden suddenly stiffened. He lurched forward, dropping to his\nknees. Ka-poel calmly withdrew her needle and stepped away from the\nWarden. She wore a vicious smile and in one hand held a half-formed wax\ndoll. Her fingers worked furiously to finish the doll.\nThe Warden came to its feet, still wobbling, still lurching. It staggered to\none side and then suddenly flew forward, charging the Kez.\nPerhaps half the grenadiers still stood, their line ragged and broken, with\nmore of them dropping beneath Kez infantry every second. The Warden\ncleared them with a single leap, landing among the Kez.\nMost of the infantry ignored him. They were used to the Wardens, of\ncourse. It wasn’t until this one took a discarded saber in his hand and began\nslicing up the Kez ranks that horror began to spread.\nThe panic was palpable. Taniel watched as the Kez began to scream and\nback away from the Warden. Some tried to stand and fight. Some even\nattacked him. A bayonet speared the Warden through the neck and the\ncreature snapped the steel bayonet off the end of the musket and kept\nfighting. The Kez began to waver.\nTaniel had killed Wardens in hand-to-hand combat, the same creatures\nthat terrorized the Adran army, and now Ka-poel had turned one on the Kez.\nA thrill worked its way up from his toes until it reached his fingertips, and\nTaniel wondered just what he’d become that allowed him to fight a\nferocious monster like that.\n“To me!” He lifted his rifle over his head. “To me!” he shouted above\nthe sound of the trumpets, blaring louder and louder for the grenadiers to\nretreat. “Bugger the trumpets, we fight!”\nThe Kez began to crumple.

Taniel rolled the corpse\naway. Etan was still breathing, much to Taniel’s relief, but there was a\nprofound look of panic in his eyes.\n“I can’t move my legs,” Etan said.\nTaniel dropped to his knees beside Etan and felt that same panic begin to\nrise within him. “It’s all right,” Taniel said. “We’ll get you a surgeon.”\n“I can’t feel my legs!” Etan gripped Taniel’s arm. He gasped, and Taniel\ncould see the strain on his face as he tried to move. “I can’t feel them!”\nTaniel felt his heart crack. Etan was one of the strongest men he knew.\nTo die in battle was one thing, but to be broken…\n“Get me a surgeon!” Taniel yelled. “And tell them to stop with the\nbloody trumpets. We won already, damn it!”\nEtan seemed to sag. “We won?”\n“We won.” Taniel looked around the field. He could see soldiers running\nfrom the Adran side, coming to provide backup. If there wasn’t a surgeon\namong them, he’d strangle someone.\n“You held it,” Etan said. “You held the line.”\n“No. You did. You and your grenadiers.”\n“Couldn’t have done it without you.” Etan was blinking rapidly now.\nTaniel searched him for a wound, trying to find something. Etan’s fingers\ngrasped the sleeve of Taniel’s jacket, his knuckles bone white, his face\ndrawn in pain. “I saw the way my boys looked at you. They would have\nfollowed you all the way to the pit just now. Just like Tamas. Just like your\nfather.”"

Just like your\nfather.”\n“Don’t say horrid shit like that,” Taniel said. He felt hot tears on his\ncheeks. “I’m nothing like that old bastard.”\n“Taniel. Promise me you’ll win this thing. Promise me you’ll finish this.\nThat this won’t be the last victory Adro has.”\n“No need for promises,” Taniel said. “You’re not dying.”\nEtan pulled Taniel close. “I can’t feel my bloody legs. I know what that\nmeans, you ass. I won’t see a battlefield again. So you promise me now that\nyou’ll win this thing.”\n“I don’t know if I can,” Taniel said.\nEtan slapped him. Taniel felt his cheek burn from the force of the blow.\n“Promise me.” Another sharp blow nearly turned Taniel around. Even lying\non the ground, unable to move his legs, Etan was strong. “Promise it!”\nA woman, one of the surgeons, threw herself to the ground on Etan’s\nopposite side. She looked him over, a frown on her face. “Where’s the\nwound?”\n“My back’s broken,” Etan said. His voice cracked. He looked Taniel in\nthe eyes. “Promise me.”\n“No.”\nEtan’s eyes were glassy with tears. “Coward. If I were dying, you’d\npromise me. Because you wouldn’t have to answer to me then. But I’m not\ndying, and you won’t promise it. Bloody coward.”\nTaniel turned his face away. He knew it was true.\nThey brought out a cart, one of the ambulances with a covered top and\nfour cots to hold the wounded, to take Etan back to camp. Etan turned his\nhead away from Taniel, and Taniel didn’t walk beside him as they carted\nhim away.\nThey had destroyed the Kez attack. Probably a thousand of the enemy\nsoldiers dead. Twice that many wounded and another few hundred taken\nprisoner. It took Taniel a moment to realize he was surrounded by soldiers.\nThe Twelfth Grenadiers. The smallest of them was a hand taller than Taniel.\nHe wondered how many had died in the melee. Their losses had to be\nstaggering.\nOne of them approached him. Taniel thought about turning away. He\ncould push through them and head back to camp. Had they been listening?\nDid they hear their colonel tell Taniel he was a coward?\nThe stout man had his bearskin hat in one hand. His other hand was\nempty. Clenched in a fist. Taniel lifted his chin and waited to be punched.\n“Sir,” the grenadier said.\n“Go ahead. I deserve it.”\nThe grenadier seemed confused. He looked down at his fist, then\nflattened his hand. “Sir, you’re not a coward. The colonel… no man wants\nto end up like that. The things he said… you’re not a coward. We just\nwatched you charge a brigade of Kez infantry by yourself. I want you to\nknow: If you need something, anything, you just say so. I’ll be there. I\nsuspect most of these boys will say the same.”"

I\nsuspect most of these boys will say the same.”\nThere was a round of nodding, and then the grenadiers began to trudge\nwearily back to camp.\nTaniel stood alone in the field for several minutes, watching the\nsurgeons cart off the dead and wounded. He felt someone behind him. He\ndidn’t have to turn around. Ka-poel.\nHe wiped the tears from his face with the sleeve of his jacket. “Don’t\nyou have bodies to examine, or some such thing?” he asked.\nShe took his hand. He wanted to pull away, but couldn’t.\nThey stood together in silence as the blood of the living and the dead\nand the dying mingled together and made a red sea of Adran soil. Taniel\nlifted her hand in his. The movement was impulsive, sudden, and he\nwondered later what thought drove him, but he touched her hand to his lips\nfirmly.\n“I’m going to end this,” he said. “I’m going to kill Kresimir. For good.\nYou need his blood? I’ll get it, even if I die doing it.”\nOut of the corner of his eye he saw her give a slight shake of her head.\nWithout warning she stepped in front of him and wrapped one hand\naround the back of his head and pulled him down to her, pressing her warm\nlips against his. It seemed as if fire raced through his veins at the touch, and\nwhen she finally stepped away, he was breathless. He fought the impulse to\ndrop to his knees, telling himself it was just blood loss that left him so\nweak.\nThen the moment was past, and silent as always, Ka-poel went about her\nbusiness, leaning over the body of a dead Adran soldier.\nStunned, Taniel watched her for several minutes until something far\nbehind the Kez line brought him out of his reverie. In an instant he was a\nsoldier again: vigilant, watchful, ready to defend against new threats from\nthe enemy.\nThe Kez soldiers were raising something into the sky above their camp,\njust north of Budwiel’s city walls. It must have been eight stories high for\nhim to be able to see it from this distance. He took a small hit of powder,\nsharpening his eyes.\nIt was an immense beam, hewn from what looked to be one giant tree.\nSoldiers and prisoners milled about the base and spread out in a fan behind\nit, pulling on long ropes tied to the top of the beam. It was lifted high and\nthen suddenly it dropped ten or twenty feet—probably into a slot dug out of\nthe ground—to stand straight in the air.\nTaniel frowned. He could see something on the side of the beam. A\nperson?\nHe focused his powder-heightened eyes. Yes. A woman, it seemed.\nStripped naked, she was nailed to the beam by her wrists, and her hands\nwere missing. A rope about her waist secured her to the beam.\nTaniel was taken aback. Was she a traitor of some kind, put up there as a\nwarning? The missing hands would indicate she’d been a Privileged. What\ncould…\nThe body moved.

She’d\nfought him in Kresim Kurga, the holy city, when he tried to keep her from\nsummoning Kresimir.\nIt was Julene.\nCHAPTER\n18\nT\namas waited for the return of his night scouts and listened to the familiar\nsounds of his soldiers breaking camp.\nThere was a light chatter this morning—something missing over the last\ntwo weeks’ worth of march since the fall of Budwiel. Someone laughed in\nthe distance. Nothing like a full belly to bring a man’s spirits up. Combine\nthat with elation at the victory over the Kez vanguard, and Tamas could\nalmost call his men happy.\nAlmost.\nTamas didn’t like eating horse. It reminded him of hard times in Gurla,\nof starvation and disease and the desert heat, when they’d been forced to\nslaughter their own healthy horses to stay alive. The taste was slightly\nsweet, and gamier than beef. Meat that came from cavalry chargers tended\nto be tough.\nThen again, at least his stomach didn’t rumble.\n“What is it, soldier?”\nVlora stood at attention on the other side of his cook fire. She snapped\noff a salute.\n“Kez spotted, sir. Riding under a white flag.”\nTamas flicked a bit of fat into the fire and watched it sizzle. He stood up,\nwiping his hands on an already soiled handkerchief. Another problem they\nfaced—no camp followers meant no laundresses. Both his uniforms were\ndirty and stained, and he smelled like a cesspool.\nAdom forbid you do your own laundry, a little voice in the back of his\nhead said. Tamas chuckled.\n“Sir?” Vlora asked.\n“Nothing, soldier. I’ll meet them on the edge of camp. Olem!”\n“Coming, sir.”\nTamas was joined by Olem and a small bodyguard of Olem’s Riflejacks.\nAmong the Ninth, stationed as the rear guard, the last tents were being\nrolled and stowed in packs and cook fires put out. They’d be on the march\nin twenty minutes. The advance elements of the Seventh were already half a\nmile down the road.\nHe passed a row of wagons. They’d been able to salvage them from the\nabandoned remains of Hune Dora. The bottoms were already stained from\nthe blood of the wounded, and they smelled like death at ten paces. Today,\nthey would carry the wounded that had survived the last two days.\n“Have those washed out,” Tamas said to Olem. “In fact, I want bathing\nmandatory. There’s plenty of mountain streams in these woods. Organize it\nwith the scouts. I want fifty men to stop and bathe in every mountain stream\nwe pass. If we don’t look to ourselves, we’ll have disease rampant in the\ncamp.”\n“Yes, sir.” Olem rubbed at his dust-caked uniform. “I could use a little\nfreshening up myself.”\nThey left the edge of the Adran camp and passed the rear pickets. The\nforest beyond was still, the only sounds that of chattering squirrels and the\ncall of birds. Tamas welcomed the birdsong. It reminded him of peace,"

        "text": "forest beyond was still, the only sounds that of chattering squirrels and the\ncall of birds. Tamas welcomed the birdsong. It reminded him of peace,\ndistracted him from the harsh call of the carrion crows and the memory of\npiled corpses that lingered behind his eyes.\nTamas saw the Kez riders before they saw him.\nThere were a dozen of them. They were still mounted upon their\nchargers in the middle of the road, watching the Adran pickets impassively.\nThey wore the heavy breastplates of cuirassiers over tan uniforms with\ngreen trim. They dismounted as Tamas drew closer and one of them\nremoved his helmet and approached.\n“Field Marshal Tamas?”\n“I am he,” Tamas said.\n“I am General Beon je Ipille,” he said in Adran with a light accent. He\nextended his hand. “The pleasure is mine.”\nTamas took the general’s hand. Beon was a young man, perhaps in his\nlate twenties. His face was boyish, touched by the same cabal sorceries that\nkept every king of the Nine looking young far beyond their years. That\nalone would have told Tamas that Beon was one of Ipille’s sons, if not for\nthe name and reputation.\n“The king’s favored son. Your reputation precedes you.”\nBeon tilted his head modestly. “And you, yours.”\n“To what do I owe the honor?” Tamas said. This was all a formality, of\ncourse. Tamas knew why Beon was here.\n“I’ve come to inquire as to your intentions in my country.”\n“Only to return to my own, and defend it from the aggression of a\ntyrant.”\nBeon didn’t even blink at the insult against his father. Tamas made a\nmental note of that. He was more levelheaded than his older brothers, it\nseemed. “I’m afraid I can’t let you do that.”\n“So we are at an impasse.”\n“Not an impasse, I think,” Beon said. “I’ve come to request your\nsurrender.”\n“An impasse. I will not surrender,” Tamas said flatly.\nBeon nodded, as if to himself. “I was afraid you would say that.”\n“Afraid?” Tamas knew Beon’s reputation. Fear didn’t enter into it. Beon\nwas almost recklessly brave. He seized opportunities a lesser commander\nmight balk at. His courage had served him well.\n“I do not relish chasing the great Field Marshal Tamas. You’ve already\nseen to my vanguard—how do you say, sending them back with their tails\ntucked between their legs?” He looked over his shoulder at one of the other\nriders. The rider was a dragoon, with a straight sword and lacking the\nbreastplate of a cuirassier. “Their commanders barely escaped with their\nlives.”\n“You could just let me go on my way,” Tamas said jovially. “I’ll be out\nof your country in a few weeks.”\nBeon chuckled. “And my father would have my head. Your men are\nhungry, Tamas. You have no food, other than the horsemeat you salvaged\nfrom my vanguard. I’ll be fair. I’ll tell you what you face, and then you can\ndecide whether to surrender. Yes?”\nTamas snorted. “That is more than fair.”"

I have ten thousand dragoons and fifty-five hundred cuirassiers\nunder my command. My elder brother is about a week’s march behind me\nwith thirty thousand infantry. I know you have eleven thousand men. We\noutnumber you four to one. You have no hope of escaping this country.\nSurrender now, and your men will be treated with respect as prisoners of\nwar.” He paused and lifted his hand, as if swearing upon the Rope. “I’ve\nstudied you, Tamas. You do not throw your men’s lives away in needless\ncauses.”\n“If you’ve studied me,” Tamas said quietly, “you’ll know that I do not\nlose.”\nBeon’s expression was bemused. “You are a dead man, Tamas. Do you\nhave any requests?”\n“Yes. I have over a hundred wounded. If I hand them over to you, will\nthey be treated with respect as prisoners of war?”\n“So that you may travel faster? No. Any wounded that fall into our\nhands will be executed as criminals.”\nBeon was a gentleman through and through. It was entirely likely he was\nbluffing. Did Tamas dare risk it?\n“Then, General, I have no more to say to you.”\nBeon gave a respectful nod. “I would wish you good luck, but…”\n“I understand.”\nThe Kez remounted and were off down the road within minutes. Tamas\nwatched them go. That general would be trouble. Incompetence was\npractically bred into the Kez army, where nobles could purchase their\ncommission or find themselves a general at the whim of the king.\nOnce in a while, though, talent rose above the chaff.\n“Olem,” Tamas said.\nThe bodyguard snapped to attention, but his eyes never left the direction\nthe Kez had gone. Tamas knew he was itching for a fight.\n“Sir?”\n“Get me an ax and meet me at the head of the column.”\nThe basic kits of all Adran infantry included a hand ax and a shovel.\nThey were meant for cutting firewood and digging latrine pits.\nA good commander utilized them for far more.\nTamas gathered his horse and rode to the front of the column. He found\nColonel Arbor at the vanguard with his First Battalion. The colonel flexed\nhis jaw, popping his false teeth out into one hand as Tamas fell in beside\nhim.\n“Nice day, sir. Trees keep the forest cool.”\nTamas examined the road. It winded along a steep, heavily forested\nhillside. Enough light reached the ground for there to be a thick\nundergrowth; thorny and tangled. Without the road, the terrain would be\nnearly impossible to traverse.\n“A word, Colonel,” Tamas said. “Pick two platoons and bring them off\nto the side.”\nArbor hollered for the Nineteenth and Thirty-Fourth Platoons. By the\ntime they’d shuffled off the road and into the forest, Olem had joined them.\nHe dismounted and handed Tamas an ax.\nTamas removed his jacket and his shirt and looked around at the men."

I mean to change that.\nEvery time there’s a narrowing in the terrain, like that one there”—he\npointed to where the road cut into the hillside up ahead—“we’re going to\ndrop a few tons of rubble there. Gather rocks, fell trees. Any kind of debris.\nAs soon as the column has passed, we’re going to stop it up.”\nTamas picked a nearby tree. It was wide enough that three men couldn’t\nhave reached around its base. It would do perfectly. He positioned himself\non the side of the tree facing the road and began to chop.\nThe two platoons set about hacking at trees with axes and billhooks and\ngathering everything they could from the nearby forest. They stacked great\npiles beside the road. Tamas pulled two more platoons out of the column,\nand by the time the last of his men had passed, they had half a dozen\nimmense trees ready to fall across the road.\nTamas turned his head at the sound of an approaching rider.\nIt was only Gavril. He reined in beside Tamas.\n“You the last of our scouts back there?” Tamas asked.\n“Aye,” Gavril said. “The Kez are a mile behind me. They’re not coming\nhard. I don’t think they’re in a hurry.” He examined the work Tamas had\nbeen doing. “Cutting trees like a logger. I like this side of you. I hope all\nthis work was worth it.”\n“It’ll take them hours to clear this,” Tamas said.\n“Or they’ll go around.”\nTamas wiped the sweat from his brow. If they found a way through the\nforest, all of this was for naught. “Can they?”\n“They’ll have to scout it,” Gavril said. “And they’ll be cautious in case\nyou’ve laid a trap. You might have bought us some time.”\nTamas took his shirt from Olem, and a soldier brought him his charger.\nHe climbed into the saddle. “Bring ’em down!” he shouted to the soldiers.\nA few minutes later the trees crashed to the ground. They were felled so\nthat they lay across each other, wedged to block the road. It wouldn’t be as\nsimple as throwing a rope around them and dragging them away with teams\nof horses.\nThe rest of the rubble was thrown to block the way, and Tamas ordered\nthe platoons to march double-time to catch up with the rest of the column.\n“Have your scouts find me good spots to block the road,” Tamas said to\nGavril.\n“Consider it done.”\n“Olem, see that those two platoons are given a double ration of\nhorsemeat tonight. They earned it.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nTamas shrugged into his shirt. “Put your mind to anything else we can\nuse to slow down the Kez. They might still dog us with a company or two,\nbut I want to keep the bulk of their numbers as far behind us as possible.”\n“I heard you met with the Kez general,” Gavril said."

Ipille’s youngest son.”\nGavril grunted. “I’ve heard he’s a decent sort—for Ipille’s spawn,\nanyway.”\n“He is.”\n“How did it go?” Gavril asked.\n“I have one regret and one hope.”\nGavril seemed intrigued. “Your hope?”\n“That I didn’t make a grave mistake refusing to surrender.”\n“And your regret?”\n“It’s too bad Beon wasn’t Ipille’s first son. He’d have made a terrific\nking. I’m going to regret killing him.”\n“I came as quickly as I could,” Adamat said.\n“Have a seat.”\nAdamat took a chair opposite Ricard and leaned back. Ricard’s face was\ngrave. What hair remained on his balding head stuck out everywhere in\nunkempt wisps, and his eyes were tired, his beard uncombed, clothes\nrumpled. Very unlike Ricard.\nRicard stared at the floor. “You heard the news?” he asked, gesturing to\nthe newspaper on his desk.\nThe paper proclaiming the death of Field Marshal Tamas was a week old\nnow.\n“All of Adro has heard it,” Adamat said.\nRicard finally looked up. When he glimpsed Adamat’s face, he nearly\nfell out of his chair. “What the pit happened to you?”\nAdamat would have snorted if it didn’t hurt so badly to do so. He\nimagined he looked far worse off than Ricard. Little sleep, his nose recently\nbroken and reset, cuts and bruises all across his face. Adamat was a horror,\nand it was interfering with his work. No one liked being seen doing\nbusiness with someone who’d had the piss beaten out of them.\n“I’ve had a few run-ins lately,” Adamat said.\nRicard waited for an explanation. Adamat wasn’t about to give him one.\n“Yes, well…” Ricard slowly tore his gaze from Adamat’s face. “The\ncountry is in an uproar. The Kez are pushing the southern front, and with\nTamas gone a few royalists have come out of the woodwork. He was the\nglue holding this whole nation together.” Ricard ran his fingers through his\nhair. “Tamas’s remaining councillors… we’ve already started bickering\namong ourselves. I don’t know what we’re going to do.”\n“Are you going ahead with the election?”\nRicard threw up his hands in exasperation. “We have no choice. We\ncould declare martial law and delay the election, but the entire army is on\nthe southern front trying to fight back the Kez.” Ricard rubbed his eyes.\n“Which brings me to why I asked you to come in: Lord Claremonte is\nmaking his move.”\nAdamat sat up straighter. “And?”\nRicard spit on the floor, then seemed to immediately regret having done\nso. “He’s declared his intention to run for prime minister of Adro.”\n“How could he?” Adamat breathed in disbelief. “He’s not even Adran!”\n“Ah, but he is. Or at least that’s what the records he provided to the\nMinisterial Review Board says. Fell! Fell, get in here!”"

        "text": "“Ah, but he is. Or at least that’s what the records he provided to the\nMinisterial Review Board says. Fell! Fell, get in here!”\nThe young woman Adamat had previously met slipped into the room.\nHer hair was done up in a braid that went over one shoulder, and she wore a\nfrilled blouse loose about the neck. “Sir?”\n“Fell, what have you got on Claremonte?”\n“Nothing,” Fell said. “If his birth records are forgeries, they’re\nextremely good. We have people going over all the information we have on\nhim. He’s never actually claimed to be Brudanian, and the Brudania-Gurla\nTrading Company doesn’t require Brudanian citizenship to become the\nhead.”\nAdamat found himself watching Fell, suddenly suspicious, and he\nwasn’t quite sure why. “Keep… keep talking,” Adamat said.\n“Sir?” Fell asked.\n“Have you found a stronger connection to Lord Vetas?” Adamat’s own\nknowledge about Vetas and Claremonte’s relationship came through the\nProprietor’s eunuch, and through Vetas’s own admission. If he’d been\nmisled in some way, it could derail his entire line of inquiry.\n“None that we can find.”\n“Why could he possibly want to be prime minister of Adro? Ricard,\ndidn’t you tell me yourself that the prime minister will be a figurehead?”\nRicard shifted uncomfortably in his chair. “That is my vision of the\nprime minster, yes.”\n“The truth is,” Fell said, without waiting for Ricard’s instruction, “the\nfirst prime minister will be the one to set the standard for every one to\nfollow him. How much power the prime minister holds, and how he wields\nit, will depend entirely on how aggressive the first man to hold the office\ndecides to be.”\nAdamat smoothed the front of his jacket. What was bothering him so\nmuch about this woman? There was something about her mannerisms that\nhe’d not noticed before… something he couldn’t quite put his finger on.\n“So if Claremonte is elected, there is the potential for him to wield as much\npower in Adro as a king?”\n“Not as much as a king,” Ricard said. “The design of the system has put\nparameters on that. However… quite a lot of power.”\n“Pit,” Adamat said.\nFell crossed to Ricard’s side. “Sir, if I may…”\n“That’s it!” Adamat stared at her.\n“What?” Ricard asked.\nAdamat reached in his pocket slowly, grasping the butt of his pistol.\n“You have the same way of speaking,” he said to Fell. “Some of the same\ncadence as he does. It’s not readily noticeable. Not like you’re family or\nanything, but as if you’ve been trained at the same finishing school.”\n“As who?” Ricard asked.\n“Lord Vetas.”\nRicard and Fell exchanged a look.\n“This is bad,” Fell said.\nRicard agreed. “Very bad.”\nAdamat’s gaze moved between the two. He found himself squeezing the\nbutt of his pistol in one hand and the head of his cane with the other. He felt\nhis jaw clench. What was going on here? What did they know that he\ndidn’t?"

Neither Ricard nor Fell seemed unduly ready to leap\nat him, so he loosened his grip on his pistol and cane. “A finishing school?”\nhe guessed.\n“Of a sort,” Ricard said. “It’s a very exclusive place. Of every thousand\nstudents they have, only one graduates.”\n“What makes it so difficult?” Adamat asked.\n“The rigors,” Fell spoke up. “Eighteen hours of work every day for\ntwenty years. Training of every sort: martial, sexual, memory retention,\netiquette, mathematics, science, politics, philosophy. Exposure to every\nschool of thought in the known world. No contact with friends or family for\nthe rest of your life. The willingness to become beholden to one man or\norganization against bribery or threat of pain or death.”\n“Sounds awful,” Adamat said. “I would have heard of such a place.”\n“No,” Ricard said. “You wouldn’t have.”\nFell was looking at her fingernails. “Only prospective clients know\nabout the Fontain Academy. It costs as much as thirty million krana to\npurchase a graduate.”\n“Purchase? So it’s slavery?” Adamat rocked back in his chair. Thirty\nmillion krana. That was a kingly sum. There were less than fifty people in\nall the Nine with access to that much money, and he didn’t think Ricard was\none of them.\nAdamat wasn’t sure if he believed this. How could an organization like\nthat exist? Certainly slavery was still openly practiced in the world, but in\nthe Nine? Not for hundreds of years. “Are you asking me to believe that\nyou and Lord Vetas are graduates of the Fontain Academy?”\n“It appears that way,” Fell said. “I couldn’t confirm it for certain, but for\nyou to make the observation you did transcends coincidence.”\n“Then what can you tell me about him?”\n“Every graduate has different specialties. But if he is a graduate, then\nhe’s dangerous. He’ll be adept at blackmail and sabotage. He’ll be smarter\nthan most of the people in this city, including you. Proficient with all\nweapons, but likely favoring knives and pistols.”\n“What’s your specialty?” Adamat asked.\nFell gave him a thin smile but didn’t answer.\n“Can we speak alone?” he asked Ricard.\nRicard nodded to Fell.\n“Sir,” Fell said. “The Fontain Academy is not a secret, strictly, but we do\nnot advertise ourselves. This information is to be kept private.”\n“I’ll respect that,” Adamat said.\nFell left the room, leaving him alone with Ricard.\nAdamat watched his friend for nearly a minute before he spoke. “You\npurchased a woman?”\n“Adamat…”\n“I didn’t think even you would stoop to that.”\n“It’s not like that, I—”"

But that’s not why I did it.”\n“Then why?”\nRicard’s face grew grim. “I love this country. I love my union. I will not\nsee either torn apart by the machinations of a foreigner. I’ll be the first\nprime minister if it kills me—or if I have to kill to do it.”\n“When?”\n“When what?”\n“When did you… purchase… her?”\n“I finalized it over the summer. She arrived four weeks ago.”\n“And where the pit did you get thirty million krana?”\n“She was ten million,” Ricard said. “About half my fortune. She’s only\nhad ten years of schooling at the academy—it’s normally twenty years.”\nAdamat shook his head. “Ten million for that girl. What were you\nthinking?”\n“She runs my organization better than I can,” Ricard said quietly. “In\none month—just one—she’s made me fifty thousand krana. She’s\nstraightened my ministerial campaign. Before her I had some good ideas,\nbut now I have a serious chance at being the prime minister of Adro. She’s\nworth every penny I spent on her.”\n“Can you trust her? What’s to stop her from killing you and taking\ncontrol of the union, if she’s so smart.”\nRicard said, “Loyalty. For the next thirty years of her life she belongs to\nme. It’s the price of schooling at the Fontain Academy. And reputation. If\nshe were to turn on me in some way, the academy would kill her\nthemselves.”\nAdamat smoothed the front of his coat again. This was all too much.\n“That reminds me,” Adamat said. “I need to borrow money.”\n“You still owe Palagyi money?” Ricard said, seemingly relieved to steer\nthe conversation away from Fell. “I’m glad you finally got some sense into\nyou. What the pit was that all about, refusing to let me pay him?”\n“Palagyi is dead. And no, not that. I need fifty thousand krana. Now. In\nbanknotes.”\nRicard blinked at him. “Fifty? I can write a check for fifty. I’d do it in a\nheartbeat for you.”\n“It needs to be cash.”\n“Can’t do it. No bank in Adro would let me take out fifty thousand all at\nonce. I could have it for you in a couple of weeks.”\n“That’s too long,” Adamat said. He rubbed his eyes. Ricard was his only\nhope of getting the money to pay Colonel Verundish to release Bo. How\ncould he himself possibly come up with that sum in a week?\nWell, perhaps Ricard wasn’t the only hope.\n“You smell like the southbound end of a northbound ass,” Gavril said.\nTamas sat and watched his charger nibble on a bit of dry grass beside the\nroad.

        "text": "road. The column had stopped for a short rest, and he was up near the\nvanguard.\nIn the distance Tamas could hear the crack of rifles. Another Kez\nscouting party close enough to engage. The Kez had been dogging their\nheels ever since Tamas’s meeting with General Beon. Their dragoons stayed\nclose, traveling in groups of ten or twenty, flanking the rear guard and\ncausing whatever mayhem they could.\nTamas was weary of it. He’d set a dozen traps, killed hundreds of Kez\ndragoons, but his men couldn’t even stop to scavenge or they risked finding\nthemselves flanked by more than just a few squads.\nGavril sniffed at the wind, as if to punctuate his previous statement.\nTamas looked down at his uniform. The dark blue didn’t show stains\nbadly, but the silver-and-gold trim had seen better days, and the linen shirt\nbeneath the jacket was yellowed from sweat, the cuffs stained dark from\npowder burns and dirt. A thin crust of dirt covered his face and hands like a\nsecond skin, and he didn’t dare imagine how his feet might smell once he\npeeled off his boots.\n“I smell fine,” he told his brother-in-law.\n“First rule of bathing,” Gavril said. “If you can’t smell yourself\nanymore, it’s time to wash. We’re stopped for lunch. The last of the\nhorsemeat is gone, so the least we can do is give the men an hour of rest.\nFollow that stream back there up a few hundred yards and there’s a\nwaterfall. Might give you some privacy.”\n“Are you going to give me your report?”\n“After you bathe.”\nTamas examined Gavril for a few moments. He was a different man\nfrom the one Tamas had met so many years ago. Jakola of Pensbrook had\nbeen a svelte, dashing character with a clean-shaven chin and broad\nshoulders. Gavril had gained a lot of weight during his time at the\nMountainwatch. He carried it well, but Gavril would still be here long after\nthe rest of them had starved to death.\nThe morbid thought gave Tamas a chuckle.\n“I’m serious,” Gavril said.\nTamas climbed to his feet. It couldn’t be helped. A sudden boyish\nimpulse struck him and he flipped Gavril a rude gesture before heading\ndown the column. Men lay about the road, their uniforms soaked with\nsweat. No one saluted him. Tamas didn’t make an issue of it. A ways down\nthe resting column, two men broke out in a fistfight. Their sergeant broke it\nup quickly. People were growing hungry again, and tensions would only get\nhigher.\nHe found the stream where a few dozen soldiers had stripped to nothing,\nwashing themselves in the cold mountain water. Tamas passed them and\nheaded upstream.\nThe stream cut through a gully, surrounded on either side by steep\nearthen walls. The trees rose even farther, towering hundreds of feet above\nhim, giving Tamas the slight feeling of claustrophobia.\nAs the stream cut around a corner, Tamas could hear the rush of falling\nwater.

This was a horrible\nplace to be. An army could come upon him, and he wouldn’t hear it over\nthe sound of the waterfall.\nEvery stop had pickets out a quarter of a mile. No one would come upon\nhim without warning.\nTamas rounded the bend to find Olem was there already, stripped down\nto his trousers, standing with his face up against the shower of falling water.\nTamas stepped toward him, and a word of greeting died on his lips.\nVlora stood under the waterfall with Olem. She was completely nude,\nher uniform discarded with the rest of her gear on the bank of the stream.\nOlem had his hands in her dark hair, pulling them through the knots and\ntangles. She said something and Olem laughed, and then she turned toward\nhim. She pushed her body up against Olem’s. She opened her mouth, and\nOlem tilted his head down toward hers.\nHer eyes flickered open. She stepped smoothly past Olem and turned her\nbody away from Tamas. Olem said something, then stole a furtive glance at\nTamas. He was suddenly washing his own hair vigorously.\n“What’s wrong?” A hand thumped Tamas’s shoulder. “Haven’t seen a\nnaked woman before?” Gavril passed Tamas, heading toward the waterfall,\nalready stripping off his shirt.\nTamas’s heart leapt, and he said a silent prayer of thanks that he didn’t\njump two feet in the air. He quickly grew conscious of his voyeurism. He\ncould feel his face growing red, so he strode to the waterfall, stripping off\nhis uniform.\nVlora left the water and gathered her knapsack, dressing quickly. A\nminute later and Tamas was alone with Gavril and Olem.\n“You know,” Gavril said to Olem, tossing his uniform on the rocks\nbeside the stream, “you’re supposed to take your pants off when you\nshower.”\nOlem cleared his throat and gave an uncomfortable laugh. He glanced in\nthe direction Vlora had gone.\nGavril gave a belly-shaking laugh. “That is a good-looking woman. I\ncan see why you left ’em on.” He elbowed Olem in the ribs, nearly\nknocking him over. Olem gave him a lopsided grin. A glance at Tamas and\nhis grin disappeared.\n“Vlora was engaged to Taniel,” Tamas said. “Up until the beginning of\nthis summer.” He stared at Olem. What had he walked in upon? Had this\nbeen going on long, or was it a chance thing?\nIf Gavril noticed the tension, he ignored it. “Not engaged to him\nanymore, is she?” He shrugged his big shoulders. “Fine-looking woman is a\nfine-looking woman. Her being unpromised is only a bonus.”\n“I sometimes forget your… habits… with women.”\nGavril squared his body to Tamas, unashamed of his nudity. “You also\nforgot about that string of seventeen-year-old noble daughters trying to bag\nthe most eligible bachelor in the Nine the year after Erika died… before we\nwent to Kez. How many of those did you bed?”"

        "text": "forgot about that string of seventeen-year-old noble daughters trying to bag\nthe most eligible bachelor in the Nine the year after Erika died… before we\nwent to Kez. How many of those did you bed?”\nTamas had forgotten all about bathing. He clutched his jacket in one\nhand, jaw clenched. “Watch your mouth, Jakola.”\nAt some point Olem had left the waterfall and gathered his shirt, jacket,\nand pistol from the ground. He began to slink downstream.\n“We’re going to have a talk, Olem,” Tamas said.\nOlem froze. Drops of water hung in his sandy beard.\nGavril’s thick finger prodded Tamas in the chest. “You’ve had your\nshare of women, Tamas. Including my sister. That means I can say what I\nwant.”\nTamas looked down at Gavril’s finger, seriously considering snapping it\noff. Who the pit did he think he was, speaking to Tamas like that? If they’d\nbeen in public, Tamas would have had no choice but to call him out. As it\nwere, he wanted to punch him in the nose. In a fight, Gavril had the strength\nand weight. Tamas had the speed, and if he had powder, it was no contest.\nHe could…\nHe stopped himself. Here he was, deep in Kez territory, pursued by an\narmy four times the size of his, and all he wanted was to feel clean again\nbefore the next battle. What was he doing? Gavril wasn’t his enemy.\nA glance over his shoulder told him Olem had gone.\n“You’re too much of a hard-ass, Tamas,” Gavril said.\nTamas hung his uniform on the protruding root of a tree and stepped\nunder the waterfall. The initial shock struck him to the core. The water was\ncold as ice, runoff from the mountain peaks towering over them to the east.\n“Sweet Kresimir!” He felt his leg stiffen with the cold.\n“I’ve taken colder baths at the Mountainwatch,” Gavril said.\nTamas looked downstream, the way Olem had gone. “Vlora was\nengaged to my Taniel. He could be dead now, for all I know. I’ll not have\n—”\n“The engagement was broken off,” Gavril cut him off. “You told me so\nyourself. Let it go. How many times did you fool around behind Erika’s\nback?”\n“None,” Tamas said. His voice came out colder than the stream.\nGavril made a face like he didn’t believe a word of it. He opened his\nmouth, but Tamas spoke first.\n“Question my honor,” Tamas said. “Just try it.”\n“Won’t say another word about it.”\n“Good. Now give me your damned report.”\n“The Kez have fallen back almost eight miles. Some of your roadblocks\nhave worked, some haven’t. The cavalry can’t be more than two abreast on\nthese roads, so their own column is miles long. They’ve got scouts ranging\neverywhere they can through the woods to try to find shortcuts. I have my\nrangers keeping an eye out for small companies that try to flank us, but so\nfar our worst enemy is the lack of food.”\n“How long until we reach the Fingers of Kresimir?” Tamas scrubbed his"

He needed a shave, badly.\n“Six days.”\n“Good.”\n“About that, I have bad news.”\nTamas sighed. “Just what I was hoping to hear.”\n“The Kez have sent their cuirassiers around to the west to cut across the\nplains. That’s fifty-five hundred heavy cavalry. What they lose in going\naround Hune Dora they’ll gain by having flat ground. If my guess is right,\nthey’ll reach the Fingers right about the time we do.\n“Last time I went through the Fingers,” Gavril continued, “the forest\nended about a mile from the first river. Open, flat plain all the way to the\nwater, then a narrow wooden bridge.”\n“A perfect place for the Kez to trap us.”\n“Exactly.”\nTamas closed his eyes, trying to see the space in his mind. It had been\nthirteen years since he last passed through the area. “I need to break the\nKez.”\n“What?”\n“Break them. I can’t have the cavalry dogging us all the way to Deliv.\nEven if we lose them for a time crossing the Fingers, they’ll be there\nwaiting for us in the Northern Expanse, and on the open plateau we won’t\nstand a chance against three brigades of cavalry.”\n“How are you going to break that many cavalry? You’ve only got eleven\nthousand men, Tamas. I’ve seen you work miracles before, but this is out of\nyour league.”\nTamas stepped out from under the cold water and snatched his uniform\nfrom the roots. He pulled his pants on over his wet body.\n“We’re going to march double-time. We can make it in four days. That’ll\ngive us preparation time.”\n“You can’t march double for four days on empty stomachs.”\nTamas ignored him. “Take twenty of your fastest riders. Take extra\nhorses—some of those we captured from the Kez. Go ahead to the Fingers.”\n“I thought we were going to slaughter the horses so the men could eat.”\n“Slaughter them when you get there. I want you to destroy the bridge.”\nGavril stepped out of the water and shook his great head, spraying water\neverywhere. It reminded Tamas of watching a bear fishing in a river. “Are\nyou mad?” Gavril asked.\n“Do you trust me?”\nGavril hesitated a few seconds too long. “Yes?”\n“Destroy the bridge, slaughter the horses, and start making rafts. Swear\nyour men to silence about the bridge. Once we catch up to you, the story is\nthat the bridge was washed out and you were sent on ahead to build rafts.”\n“You better have a damned good reason for destroying that bridge before\nwe cross it,” Gavril said. “Otherwise my men will string me up for trying to\nget our whole army killed.”\nTamas pulled his jacket on. “Do it. Only take men you trust.”\nHe began walking down the stream as Gavril began to dress. He paused\nwhen Gavril called out behind him.\n“Tamas,” his brother-in-law said. “Try not to get us all slaughtered.”"

He paused\nwhen Gavril called out behind him.\n“Tamas,” his brother-in-law said. “Try not to get us all slaughtered.”\nCHAPTER\n19\nH\nave you wondered,” Taniel said, “why they always sound the retreat?”\nHe sat at Colonel Etan’s bedside in a small inn off the main road in the\ntown of Rue, about two miles behind the front line. It was a quiet town,\nthough the echo of distant artillery still reminded Taniel that there was a\nwar carrying on without them.\nEtan was propped up in his bed by a pile of feather pillows. A nurse was\nstationed just outside the door to see to his needs, while a steady stream of\nEtan’s grenadiers had been coming and going all day, wishing him well and\ntaking orders to the front.\nOnly a wounded colonel would get this kind of treatment, Taniel knew.\nHe’d heard of a few infantrymen who’d broken their backs. Most died from\nneglect within a few months.\nTaniel watched his friend out of the corner of his eye and made a few\nmarks in his sketchbook, outlining Etan’s strong jaw in charcoal. Etan had\nrefused the offer to step down from his post. Said he could—and would—\nstill command the Twelfth Grenadiers, even if he had to do it from a chair.\nRumors were that General Hilanska was going to force Etan’s resignation.\nTaniel hoped not. Retaining command of his grenadiers was the only\nthing keeping Etan from surrendering to despair.\n“We retreat,” Etan said, “because we’re always overwhelmed.” He\ndipped a feather pen in an inkwell and finished a sentence on the paper in\nhis lap. He’d cursed and shouted when Taniel had first pulled out his\nsketchbook. Now he seemed to be doing his best to ignore the fact that\nTaniel was sketching him.\nTaniel studied Etan’s face, his mind elsewhere. Something seemed\nwrong about the trumpets. The retreats. Every damned time. “You know\nTamas’s campaign history as well as any historian. How many times has he\nsounded a retreat?”\n“Seven, if memory serves.”\n“Out of how many battles?”\n“Hundreds.”\n“And the last few weeks how many times have we fallen back before the\nKez?”\nEtan sighed, setting down his feather pen and rubbing his eyes. “Taniel,\nwhat does it matter? The generals don’t have a choice. It’s either fall back\nwith heavy losses or suffer the deaths of every man on the front.”\n“What if one of the generals is in league with the Kez?” Taniel mused\naloud. “Ordering the retreat early each time?”\n“Those are dangerous accusations.”\n“Tamas believed there was a traitor—”\nEtan cut him off. “And he was right. He caught the bastard. Charlemund\nwon’t see the light of day again, no matter what threats the Church makes.”\n“Tamas might not have caught all the traitors,” Taniel said quietly.\n“These generals were handpicked by Tamas. Every one of them has\nsupported him for years, even through the coup—where the risks of failure\nwere high, and they’d all be labeled traitors. They are capable and loyal.”"

Every one of them has\nsupported him for years, even through the coup—where the risks of failure\nwere high, and they’d all be labeled traitors. They are capable and loyal.”\nTaniel took a small pinch of powder and snorted it off the back of his\nhand. He fought to clear his mind. There was a time when the tiniest bit of\npowder would allow him to focus and think, but it seemed harder and\nharder to do so.\nPowder. That was the other thing bothering him.\n“Do you have access to quartermaster reports?” Taniel asked.\nEtan finished writing another missive and set it on the table beside his\nbed. “For my regiment, certainly.”\n“I don’t need them for your regiment. I need them for the entire army.\nCan you get them?”\n“I’d need to pull some strings…”\n“Do it.”\nEtan’s mouth hardened into a flat line. “Because I’m so disposed to\ndoing you favors right now.”\n“Please?” Taniel said, sketching Etan’s shoulders.\n“Why?”\n“Something that’s been niggling in the back of my mind. I just want to\nsee how much black powder the army has been using.”\n“All right,” Etan agreed with a sigh. “I’ll see what I can do.” He fell\nsilent and for several minutes there was nothing but the sound of Etan’s\nfeather pen scratching away at the paper. Etan seemed enthralled by his\nwork. Since his paralysis, Etan had rushed headlong into the administrative\nduties of his rank. He’d spent the last three days checking on supply reports,\nreading recruitment numbers, and leafing through dossiers of men who\nmight be considered for rank advancement.\nTaniel was glad Etan had something to do to keep his mind off his\ninjury.\nThe sound of Etan’s pen suddenly stopped. “How do the Kez have so\nmany bloody Black Wardens?” he asked. “Didn’t—doesn’t—your father\nhave a hard time finding them as it is?”\n“Can’t say for sure,” Taniel said as he gave a little more shape to Etan’s\nchin in his drawing. He’d wondered the same thing himself. “The Kez\npurge their countryside of powder mages every two years and make regular\nsweeps in the meantime. Tamas always assumed the mages they rounded up\nwere executed. His spies never reported anything else.”\nEtan tapped the feather pen on the paper. “You think that maybe the Kez\nhave been imprisoning them?”\n“That’s my thought,” Taniel said. “Kez has a much greater population\nthan Adro, which could partly account for their numbers. And I think\nKresimir is the one turning them into Powder Wardens. It can’t be\ncoincidence that these new bastards appeared at the same time as Kresimir.”\nEtan began to write again, only to stop a moment later. “Oh,” he said. “I\ngot something for you.”\n“Eh?”\nEtan produced a silver snuffbox and handed it to Taniel. “I heard you\nlost your old one on South Pike. Thought you’d like it.”\nTaniel flipped open the lid. Inside, it was engraved with the words\n“Taniel Two-Shot, the Unkillable.”"

Inside, it was engraved with the words\n“Taniel Two-Shot, the Unkillable.”\n“The Unkillable?” Taniel scoffed.\n“That’s what the boys have taken to calling you.”\n“That’s absurd. Anyone can be killed.” He held out the snuffbox. “I\ncan’t take this.”\nEtan began to cough. He fell back with a grimace, clutching his side.\n“Take it, you stubborn bastard, or I’ll start screaming at you for being a\ncoward again. You and that girl of yours saved our asses out there.”\n“She’s not my girl.”\nEtan snorted. “Oh, really? Rumors are getting around, Taniel.” Etan\nlooked down at his hands. “I shouldn’t tell you this, but the General Staff\nwants you two separated. Says it’s bad for morale, having a war hero\ngallivanting around with a savage.”\n“You believe all that? Agree with it?” Taniel stiffened. He didn’t have to\nsit here and listen to this drivel.\nEtan made a calming motion. “I see your face when you look at her.\nSame way you used to look at Vlora.” Etan shrugged. “I won’t judge. Just\nwarning you about the rumors.”\nTaniel forced himself to relax. The way he used to look at Vlora? This\nwas almost as preposterous as the grenadiers calling Taniel “unkillable.”\n“What should I do? I’m not going to send her away.”\n“Marry her?”\nTaniel laughed, shaking his head at the absurdity of the statement.\n“I’m not joking,” Etan said. “The General Staff can say anything they\nwant about propriety, but if she’s your wife, they have to stuff it.” He began\nto cough again, harder this time.\n“You need rest,” Taniel said. Etan’s face had turned as pale as Taniel’s\nsketch paper. In the hours of the afternoon Taniel had almost forgotten the\nseverity of Etan’s injury. His sudden frailty brought it all back.\n“I need to write out more orders.”\n“Rest.” Taniel took the paper and quill from Etan and set them beside\nthe bed. He put the snuffbox there with them and headed for the door.\n“Taniel.”\n“Yes?”\nEtan plucked the snuffbox off his bedside table and tossed it to Taniel,\nwho caught it in one hand.\n“Take it,” Etan said. “Or I’ll have you shot.”\n“All right, all right. I’ll take it.” He closed the door behind him.\nKa-poel was waiting in the hallway, sitting on the ground just outside\nthe door with her legs crossed, one of her wax dolls in hand. She stowed it\nand stood up. If she’d heard what Etan had to say about her, she gave no\nindication.\n“Can you do anything for him?” Taniel asked.\nA slight shake of her head.\n“Damn it, Pole. You practically brought me back from the dead, and you\ncan’t…”\nShe held up a finger, her forehead wrinkling in a frown. Taniel thought\nshe might go on, but instead she turned and walked away."

Taniel thought\nshe might go on, but instead she turned and walked away.\nHe followed her down and through the common room of the inn, where\nwounded soldiers talked and drank while they waited to be sent home or\nback to the front. There was a somber air to the room. A woman sat in one\ncorner, alone, her leg amputated at the knee. She moaned to herself, a lonely\nkeening sound that everyone tried to ignore.\nThe weather outside didn’t improve Taniel’s mood. The sky had\nthreatened rain for a week now, every day a little cloudier. Yesterday there’d\nbeen a misting drizzle in the evening—just enough to make the grass slick\nand the fighting all the more treacherous.\nTaniel stopped just outside the inn and wondered if he should have\ngotten a drink before heading back to the front.\nA pair of provosts approached from the street. Both carried heavy steel\npikes and wore Adran blues with green trim and the insignia of mountains\ncrossed by cudgels.\nCoincidence, Taniel wondered, or were they waiting for him?\n“Captain Taniel Two-Shot?”\n“What?”\n“You’re to come with us, sir.”\nDefinitely waiting for him. “On whose authority?”\n“General Ket’s.”\n“I don’t think I’ll do that.” Taniel touched the butt of his pistol.\n“We’re placing you under arrest, sir.”\nArrest? This had gone too far. “On what charge?”\n“That’s for General Ket to say.”\nOne stepped forward, taking Taniel by the arm.\nTaniel jerked away. “Get your hands off me. I know my rights as a\nsoldier of the Adran army. You’ll tell me the charges or you’ll go to the pit.”\nTaniel’s senses told him that they didn’t have an ounce of powder. They’d\ncome ready. For him.\nOr had they? The provost jerked hard on Taniel’s arm, like he was some\nkind of unruly child. “Come quiet-like now. We’re to bring the girl as well.\nWhere is she?”\nWhere had Ka-poel gone? Taniel looked around, pulling his arm away\nfrom the provost.\n“Now, sir! Don’t make us—”\nTaniel’s fist connected with the provost’s chin, sending the man to the\nground. The other provost lowered his pike and stepped forward\nthreateningly. Taniel shifted to one side, grabbed the pike by the shaft, and\njerked the man off balance. The provost stumbled forward, and Taniel\nplanted a fist into the side of his head.\nThe first provost came to his feet, already swinging. His ears were red,\nhis face twisted in an angry grimace at having been sucker punched to the\nground. The provost was easily a head taller than Taniel and weighed four\nstone more.\nTaniel caught the provost’s fist and slammed his opposite hand into the\nman’s elbow. He heard the snap, saw the blood and the white bone sticking\nout of the flesh.\nThe provost’s scream drew more attention than Taniel wanted. He let the\nman fall to the ground and then started walking briskly toward the front."

General Ket had the gall to arrest him? It seemed like Taniel\nwas the only thing left between the Kez and Adopest. He’d killed half of\ntheir remaining Privileged, giving the Wings a clear advantage on the field,\nand he’d run out of room for notches on his rifle, he’d killed so many\ninfantry.\nKa-poel joined him a few moments later. One minute he was walking\nalone, trying to ignore the stares of anyone who’d seen him break a\nprovost’s arm, and the next she was beside him, strolling along as if nothing\nhad happened.\n“Where the pit were you?”\nKa-poel didn’t respond.\n“Well…” Taniel gritted his teeth. Pit. A general had an arrest warrant out\nfor him. They’d come sooner or later, in force. What could he do? Break the\narms of every provost in the army? “If they come again, disappear just like\nthat. I don’t want them getting their damned hands on you.”\nShe nodded.\nTaniel felt his steps grow in purpose as he headed back toward the front.\nHe changed his course a little and went toward the cooking tents.\nTaniel found his goal in the third mess tent he looked inside.\nThe master chef, Mihali, was alone inventorying barrels. He held a piece\nof charcoal in one hand and paper in the other. His long black hair was tied\nbehind his head in a ponytail.\n“Good afternoon, Taniel,” Mihali said without turning around.\nTaniel came up short as the tent flap fell closed behind him. “Have we\nmet?”\n“No. But I’m friends with your father. Please, come in.”\nTaniel stayed warily near the tent flap. Ka-poel had come inside behind\nhim, and she seemed to have no reservations about plopping down on a\nbarrel in one corner.\n“Tamas is dead,” Taniel said.\n“Oh, don’t be silly. You don’t believe that.”\n“I’ve come to accept it.”\nMihali still hadn’t turned around. Even with his back toward Taniel, he\nhad a kind of presence that made Taniel second-guess his decision to come\nthere. There was something about him. A smell, maybe? No. Something\nmore subtle. Just the slightest sense of familiarity.\n“Tamas is very much alive,” Mihali said. His lips moved silently, finger\nwagging as he counted barrels in one corner of the tent. “Along with most\nof the Seventh and the Ninth. They’re being pursued heavily right now by\nthree full brigades of cavalry and six brigades of infantry.”\nTaniel snorted. “How can you know all that?”\n“I am Adom reborn.”\n“So. You do claim to be a god?”\nMihali finally turned around with a sigh, making marks on his paper. He\nhad a pudgy, elongated face that spoke of a mix of Adran and Rosvelean\nancestry. His white apron was stained with flour and blood, and there was a\npiece of potato peel stuck to the side of his clean-shaven chin. “Is it that\nhard to believe? You’ve attempted to kill one god.”"

I saw his face. I looked upon\nKresimir and I knew with every bit of me that he was a god. You…” Taniel\ntrailed off, watching the master chef for the anger that was sure to come.\n“Not so much?” Instead of taking offense, Mihali laughed. “Kresimir\nwas always so much better at appearing effortlessly grand. Your father\nneeded to come to believe on his own. You, I think, need a more direct\napproach.” Mihali approached him and held a hand out toward his head. He\nstopped suddenly, recoiling. Taniel noticed that Mihali’s hand was\ntrembling.\n“May I?” Mihali asked Ka-poel.\nKa-poel returned his stare, her eyes daring him to try.\nMihali extended his hand once more toward Taniel. As it drew closer, it\ntrembled harder and harder, as if affected by some unseen force. Finally, the\nchef’s fingers brushed Taniel’s skin.\nTaniel felt a spark.\nThen it seemed as if the universe flashed before his eyes. Countless\nyears zoomed by, filling Taniel’s memories like they were his own. He saw\nKresimir’s original descent from the heavens, and then felt Kresimir call to\nhis brothers and sisters to aid him in rebuilding the Nine. He witnessed the\nchaos of the Bleakening, and the relentless march of the centuries.\nLifetimes rushed past in a blink of an eye.\nAnd then it was all gone.\nTaniel staggered backward, gasping.\nKa-poel had done something similar to him once, several months ago. It\nhad left him breathless in its emotion and magnitude, though it had only\nbeen a few moments’ worth of memories.\nThis was two thousand years’ worth.\nIt took him some time to recover. When he did, he said, “You are a god.”\nNot a question this time.\n“ ‘God’ is a funny word,” Mihali said, turning back to his inventory. He\nmade a mark on his paper and silently counted sacks of onions. “It implies\nomnipotence and omniscience. Let me assure you, I am neither.”\n“Then what are you?” Bo had once said that the gods were nothing more\nthan powerful Privileged. With memories like that, how could Mihali be\nanything but a god?\n“Semantics, semantics!” Mihali threw up his hands. “For the sake of\nargument, let’s say yes, I am a god. I don’t think either of us has the time\nfor a theo-philosophical argument right now. Please, have a seat.” Mihali\npicked up a wine barrel like it weighed no more than a couple pounds and\nset it beside Taniel, then went to get another.\nTaniel tried to nudge the barrel over a few inches. He couldn’t. He\nfrowned, then looked at Mihali as the chef fetched a barrel for himself and\none for Ka-poel.\nKa-poel’s hand casually brushed Mihali’s arm.\n“Now, girl,” Mihali said as a man might gently reprimand a daughter,\n“none of that.” He gently touched her fingers."

Had she been trying to collect a hair from\nthe chef?\nMihali deposited himself on his wine barrel. “Unlike my brothers and\nsisters, I decided to stay on in this world after organizing the Nine. Hidden,\nof course. But learning.” There was a far-off look in Mihali’s eye as he\nstared at something Taniel could not see. “Distant stars are beautiful and\ncurious, but I found the people here so varied and enchanting I couldn’t\nleave.”\nMihali glanced at Ka-poel. “I’ve studied the Bone-eyes. Not in depth.\nBeing in Dynize and Fatrasta, so far away from Adro, taxes my strength. I\nnever knew how Kresimir and the rest left the planet. They always called\nme a homebody for not wanting to explore the cosmos. Anyway, the Bone-\neyes have incredible magic. So very different from anything Kresimir or the\nothers could imagine. You, my dear, are truly terrifying. So much\npotential.”\nMihali didn’t look terrified. If anything, he seemed intrigued.\nThe chef turned to Taniel. “And powder mages! Kresimir wouldn’t have\nexpected that. After all, gunpowder wasn’t invented until hundreds of years\nafter he left.” Mihali drummed a pudgy finger on his chin. “He’s going mad,\nyou know. That Bone-eye bullet you put in his eye was never removed. It’s\nin his brain, causing him incredible pain every day.”\nTaniel tried to work moisture into his mouth. Kresimir, a god, was going\nmad. All because of him. “Does he know who shot him?”\n“I believe he knows. What you did on South Pike is barely a rumor in\nthe Adran army, and the only two to survive that battle on the Kez side were\nJulene and Kresimir.” Mihali paused. “Of course, he has Julene. Then he\nmust know.”\n“He nailed Julene to a beam. Cut off her hands. Why would he do that?”\nMihali frowned. “Julene. Misguided child. She may or may not have\ndeserved that, but I don’t think torture does anyone any good.”\nTaniel noticed that Mihali had sidestepped the question about Julene. He\ndecided not to press it.\n“How can I kill him?”\n“Kresimir? Hmm. What makes you think I’d tell you?”\nTaniel rocked back. “But… you’re on our side. Aren’t you?” He felt his\nmuscles tense, a bit of fear touching his heart.\n“I defend Adro. It’s my country, after all. However, Kresimir is still my\nbrother. I love him. I will not see him dead. I would, however, like to stop\nhim. Help him. If I can get that bullet out of his brain, I might even be able\nto reason with him and end this whole thing.”\nTaniel’s fingers curled into fists. “I’m going to kill him.”"

If I can get that bullet out of his brain, I might even be able\nto reason with him and end this whole thing.”\nTaniel’s fingers curled into fists. “I’m going to kill him.”\n“That may be your path.” Mihali examined his inventory paper. Once\nagain, he seemed to be counting.\nIt was several moments before Taniel spoke again. “The generals. Do\nthey know…?”\n“Oh, Tamas told them. Most of them don’t believe it.”\n“But they know you’re a powerful Privileged?”\nMihali nodded. “An uncomfortable truth. They asked me to participate\nin the fighting and I refused. After all, the Privileged with the Wings of\nAdom are doing a fine job keeping the remainder of the Kez Cabal in\ncheck.”\n“Did you tell them that Tamas was alive?”\n“Of course.”\nTaniel blinked at this. “Then why haven’t they told me? Hilanska…\nsurely he would have said something if there were hope.”\n“Not even a god sees everything,” Mihali said. “I do not know. But I\ndon’t trust the generals. I’m sure that most of them have Adro’s best\ninterests at heart. But a few…”\n“General Ket.”\nMihali shrugged. “The provosts are here, by the way.”\nTaniel stepped to the tent flap and took a peek. Dozens of them had\ngathered outside.\n“Pit. Can I get out the back way?”\n“They’ve surrounded the tent. It’s probably best that you go with them.”\n“I won’t let them arrest me. The bastards. I—”\nMihali cleared his throat. “As I said. It’s probably for the best. For now,\nanyway.”\nTaniel’s mind raced. What to do? Run for it? Go out, dignified, and let\nthem take him away? “Answer me this, first: What has happened to me?\nI’m stronger and faster than before. I’ve never felt this kind of power. It\ntook enough mala to kill a horse just to get me buzzed. I know it’s more\nthan just being a powder mage. Is it because of her?” He flung his finger\ntoward Ka-poel, who raised an eyebrow in response.\nMihali hesitated for several moments. “You’ve been tempered,” he said.\n“This girl here has you wrapped in protective sorceries. Kresimir’s\nreturning strike after you shot him was enough to bring down South Pike\nMountain. It should have shattered your mortal body. That blow he gave\nyou could very well have killed me, for all my knowledge of sorcery. But\nyou…” Mihali chuckled, as if something was funny. “You, it just made\nstronger.”\n“That doesn’t make any sense, it—”\n“It’s time to go,” Mihali said.\nTaniel took a deep breath. “All right. Ka-poel, stay here. I don’t want\nthem touching you.” Without waiting for an answer, he stepped out of the\ntent and into daylight.\nThe provosts surrounded him quickly, their pikes leveled.\n“All right, you bastards.

Taniel staggered\nforward, spitting blood from the blow. Another hit his stomach, then his\nknee. He collapsed to the ground. He was cursed and kicked and beaten,\nand when he thought he could take no more, he was pulled to his feet and\nstruck about the face and head until he lost consciousness.\nCHAPTER\n20\nT\namas listened to his stomach growl as his charger trotted along the road\nat the rear of the column. Ahead of him, the men of the Ninth Brigade\nshuffled to the crack of a single drummer boy’s snare. The air was hot and\noppressive, even with the cover of tall pine trees. The summer humidity\nsoaked through Tamas’s soiled jacket and made every breath a labor.\nHe watched one of the infantry in the column ahead of him. The man\nwas tall, with dirty-blond hair pulled back in a ponytail over one shoulder.\nAbout twenty minutes ago his shoulders had started to sway dangerously as\nhe marched. He’d be the next to faint. Tamas would have put money on it.\nEvery so often the soldiers would glance back at Tamas’s charger with\nhungry eyes. They watched with the same looks every scout and officer\nwho was still riding. It was unsettling.\nThey’d slaughtered the last of the Kez horses two days ago and\ndistributed the meat. Tamas heard rumor that some of the company\nquartermasters were holding back and selling the last precious pounds. He’d\ntried to get to the bottom of it, but no one would confess. Every stream they\npassed saw a dozen men leave the line, throwing themselves into the mud in\nsearch of tiny fish and crawdads. Their sergeants had to beat them back into\nthe column.\n“They think they’re going to get a meal soon,” Olem said.\nTamas shook himself from his reverie. He felt light-headed, weak. He’d\nnot eaten in four days. The men on their feet needed it more than he did. At\nleast there was some periodic grazing for the horses.\nOlem pointed up to a pair of buzzards circling high above the treetops.\n“Ah,” Tamas said.\n“They’ve been following us for fifty miles,” Olem said.\n“You can’t be sure it’s the same vultures.”\n“One of ’em has red on the tips of his feathers.”\nTamas grunted. Words were coming slow out of his mouth. The heat\ndidn’t make him feel much like talking.\n“That red-tipped buzzard kept on when most of the others stayed behind\nat the camp two mornings ago, when we slaughtered the horses.” Olem\npursed his lips. “I think he’s hoping for the big payday.”\nTamas looked up at the buzzards. He didn’t want to talk about them.\nHe’d seen far too many on far too many battlefields. “I haven’t seen you\nsmoke for a week,” he said.\n“Too bloody hot, pardon the language, sir.” Olem patted his breast\npocket. “Besides. I’m saving my last one.”\n“A special occasion of some kind?”\nOlem continued to watch the buzzards. “Gavril told me we might be"

I figure it’ll be nice to die with a cigarette\nbetween my lips.”\nTamas couldn’t help but scowl. “Have you told anyone? About the\nstand, I mean.”\n“No, sir.”\n“Damned Gavril. Needs to keep his mouth shut.”\n“So it’s true, then?”\n“I don’t intend to make a last stand, Olem. I intend to break the Kez.\nLast stands are for men who plan on losing.”\n“Quite right, sir.”\nTamas sighed inwardly. Soldiers had a strange sense of fatalism. Most of\nthem didn’t realize that any odds could be beaten with the right\nmaneuvering.\n“Olem…” Tamas began.\n“Sir?”\n“About what I saw the other day…”\nA muscle jumped in Olem’s jaw. “What do you mean, sir?”\n“I think you know what I mean. Vlora. If I’d come a few minutes later, I\nthink I would have found the two of you in a much more compromising\nposition.”\n“That was the hope, sir.”\nTamas blinked. He’d not expected that kind of bluntness. “Can’t hold\nyour tongue to save face, can you?”\n“Not to save my life, sir.”\n“I won’t have that kind of fraternization, Olem.”\n“What kind, sir?” The corners of Olem’s eyes tightened.\n“You and Vlora. She is a captain, you are—”\n“A captain,” Olem said. “You made me one yourself.” He touched the\ngold pins on his lapels helpfully.\nTamas cleared his throat and looked up. Those damned buzzards were\nstill there. “I mean that she is a powder mage. You know my mages are a\ndifferent contingent of the army. I won’t have you crossing that line.”\nOlem looked like he wanted to say something. He worked his jaw\naround, chewing on a phantom cigarette. “Yes, sir. Whatever you say, sir.”\nThe sarcasm in Olem’s tone leaked through like water through paper. It\nnearly shocked Tamas. Olem was normally so loyal, so quick to obey. He\nopened his mouth, a rebuke on his tongue.\nThe soldier with a ponytail staggered and fell out of line, hitting the\nground hard. Two of his companions stopped to help him.\n“Head up the line,” Tamas said. “Call for rest. The men need a sit-\ndown.”\nOnly too grateful to get away, Olem spurred his mount on, calling out,\n“Field Marshal orders the column to halt! Fall out!”\nTamas could hear the order repeated farther up the column. Slowly, the\nline of soldiers came to a stop. Some men went looking for the closest\nstream, some men relieved themselves in the woods, and others slumped to\nthe ground where they were, too exhausted to move.\nTamas opened his canteen and drained the last few drops. The water was\nhot and tasted of the metal. “Soldier,” Tamas said, pointing to a man who\nlooked the least worse for the wear. “Find me some clean, cold water and"

He paced the width of the road, trying to work some feeling back into\nhis legs after riding half the day. He stopped once and looked south. No sign\nof the Kez. The woods were too thick. According to the latest reports, the\nhead of the Kez column was ten miles back. They had dragoons ranging in\nthe area in between, trying to catch Adran stragglers and harass the end of\nthe Adran column, but what mattered to Tamas was where the bulk of the\ncavalry were.\nHe was going to need that heavy lead.\n“Sir.”\nTamas turned to find Vlora standing next to his charger. Her uniform\nwas dirty, jacket loosened at the neck, her black hair tied back behind her\nhead. He had the brief image of her naked beneath the waterfall, leaning in\nto kiss Olem. He willed the image away, trying not to let his embarrassment\nshow on his face.\n“Captain.”\n“How is the leg, sir?”\nTamas flexed the muscles in his leg, felt them twinge. Riding hadn’t\nhelped it loosen at all, but the pain wasn’t too bad. “It’s fine, thank you.\nAny luck hunting?”\n“The deer are keeping well away from the column. If we range more\nthan a mile or two from the road, we won’t be able to carry our prey back.\nA few squirrels and rabbits. Enough to keep the powder mages fed.”\nAt least his mages were keeping up their strength. He felt his stomach\ntwist at the mention of rabbit.\n“If we camped for more than one night, or even slowed down a bit, we\nmight be able to bag some deer.”\n“Sorry, Captain. I can’t allow that. We have to reach the Fingers well\nahead of the Kez.”\n“The scouts say we’ll be there in two days, sir.”\n“That’s right,” Tamas said. “Once we cross the first river, we’ll burn the\nbridge and take it easy for a couple of days. Rest and restock.”\n“I certainly hope so, sir. The men are looking poor.”\nTamas turned his attention to the soldier who had fainted. He was sitting\nup now, drinking out of a canteen, talking to one of his fellows. Tamas\nclasped his hands behind his back and faced Vlora.\n“Captain, you and I both know that what happened the other day was\ncompletely out of order.”\nVlora didn’t even blink. “You mean, when you watched me bathe?”\nTamas could have slapped her for that. Damned girl. She knew what he\nwanted to say, and she wasn’t going to make it easy.\n“You and Olem…”\n“Sir, I don’t think that’s any of your business. With all due respect.”\n“I am your commanding officer—”\n“Yes, sir. And you’ve always made it very clear that what two soldiers"

And you’ve always made it very clear that what two soldiers\nwant to do in their spare time is up to them, as long as it doesn’t break\nconvention between the ranks.”\n“This is different.” This was different, Tamas told himself. “I won’t have\none of my Marked gallivanting around with my bodyguard, do you\nunderstand? I won’t have my bodyguard going around with… with…”\n“A whore?”\nShe had spoken quietly, but Tamas felt the breath taken from him.\n“That’s what you want to say, isn’t it, sir? You want to call me a whore\nfor what I did to Taniel? A slut? I can hear the words on the tip of your\ntongue, even if you don’t speak them.”\n“Watch your tone, soldier,” Tamas warned.\n“Permission to speak freely, sir?”\n“Permission denied.”\nVlora ignored him. “You don’t think I know what I did to Taniel? You\ndon’t think it kills me inside knowing that I threw away everything we had\nfor a few months of passion with some idiot?”\n“Permission denied, Captain.”\n“You don’t hear the men talk.” Vlora’s voice rose. “You don’t hear what\neveryone says about me behind my back—even to my face. You don’t see\nthe sneers. ‘Vlora, she’ll spread her legs for anyone now.’ You don’t hear\nthem whisper that outside your tent at night, placing bets on who can be the\nfirst to get me on my back.”\n“Permission denied!” Tamas stepped forward. Any other soldier would\nhave shrunk beneath the red fury in Tamas’s eyes, but Vlora refused to back\ndown.\n“I spent eighteen months alone while Taniel was in Fatrasta because you\nsent him there. Taniel, the war hero. People talked about how every woman\nin Fatrasta was ready to throw themselves on him. And then to hear he had\na little savage girl, following him everywhere. What was I supposed to\nthink of that? No man would look twice at me at the university. They knew\nwho I was. They were too afraid of Taniel to say any nice thing to me.”\nVlora spat the words in Tamas’s face, her voice dripping with bitterness,\nher whole body trembling with rage. “Then a man appears who doesn’t care\nwhose fiancée I am. He charms me, loves me, and assures me there’s not\nanother in the world that can make him so happy. I trusted him.” Vlora’s\nface twisted in disgust. “Then I find out he was bedding me just to make\nyou look bad.”\nThe pain in Vlora’s eyes and the malice in her voice was more than\nTamas could bear. Once, he had been her father, her friend, her mentor. But\nnow he had become nothing more to her than an object of hatred, an enemy\nto despise.\n“Get out of my sight, Captain. If we weren’t at war, I’d have you court-\nmartialed.”\nVlora leaned forward, closer than anyone who didn’t know Tamas as\nwell as she did would have dared. Close enough to embrace him. Close"

Close\nenough to stick a knife in his ribs if she wanted. “Kill me yourself, if you\nwant it done so badly,” she said. “Don’t hand the job over to lesser men.”\nShe whirled on her heel and strode down the column. Soldiers stared\nopenmouthed at her as she went past, then turned to look toward Tamas,\nwaiting for his wrath to follow like thunder after lightning.\nTamas watched Vlora almost disappear around a bend in the road. She\nmade an abrupt stop as Olem rode into view. The bodyguard leaned over his\nhorse, said something to her. She put her hand on his thigh. He pushed it\naway gently and gave a meaningful glance at Tamas.\nVlora grabbed Olem by the belt and pulled him off his horse, pushing\nhim into the woods off the trail. Tamas swore under his breath and took two\nsteps down the column.\nSomeone cleared their throat. Tamas looked around.\nIt was the soldier he’d sent for water. “Your canteen, sir.”\nTamas snatched the canteen. When he looked again, Olem and Vlora\nwere gone.\nHe took several deep breaths and went back to his horse.\n“Sir, you mind if I ask how long until we march again?” the soldier\nasked.\nTamas took a long draw of water. It was so frigid it seemed to burn his\nthroat going down. It made his teeth hurt.\n“Thirty minutes, damn it. Get some rest.”\nAdamat rapped on the door of the foreman’s office in the textile mill. Below\nhim, dozens of steam-powered looms thundered at full tilt throughout the\nday, creating a racket that drowned out all but the loudest shouts. Hundreds\nof workers tended the millworks, moving about the floor like so many\ninsects.\nAdamat let himself into the foreman’s office. Inside, the sound was\ngreatly reduced.\n“Margy,” he called.\nThe woman emerged from the back of the room and smiled when she\nsaw Adamat. He leaned in and kissed her on the cheek.\nShe stepped back from him in shock. “What in all the Nine have you\ndone to yourself?”\n“Fell down the stairs,” Adamat said. His voice whined nasally, and his\nface still hurt as if the broken nose had happened only an hour ago.\nMargy harrumphed. “Looks more like you got it punched in,” she said.\n“I alway told you putting your nose in other people’s business was going to\nget it broken.”\nAdamat threw his hands up in mock surrender. “I’ve only got a moment,\nMargy. I just dropped by to see if you had a lead on that rug.”\n“Fine, fine.” Margy moved over to the desk beside her microscope and\nbegan leafing through papers. “I sent Faye a letter last week,” she said.\n“I’ll ask if she got it.” Adamat leaned against the doorpost and closed his\neyes.

He paused\nin the hallway. The door to the flat was open.\nPart of him screamed to just turn and walk away. He might not survive\nthe next run-in with Vetas’s goons.\nHe drew his pistol and checked to see if it was loaded before pushing\ngently on the door.\nSouSmith sat on the sofa.

Someone break your\nnose?”\nAdamat called for the landlady to put a kettle on, and closed the door\nbehind him. “You’re soaked with blood.”\n“None of it’s mine,” SouSmith said. “Least, not much. Nose?”\n“One of Vetas’s goons was waiting at my old house. Hit me in the face\nwith a cudgel. Now what’s this? You can’t be sitting in a man’s living room\ncovered in someone else’s blood without an explanation.”\n“Four o’ Vetas’s men came by my brother’s place,” SouSmith said.\n“Shot one of my nephews.

Adamat needed every man\nhe could get on his side.\n“Get cleaned up,” Adamat said. “You left some clothes here.”\n“We going somewhere?”\n“I have to see a man about fifty thousand krana.”\nAdamat stepped out of the carriage in the Routs—the very best part of\ntown, filled with large brick bankers’ houses. The streets were wide, paved\nwith flat cobbles, and lined with towering elms. Adamat tilted his hat up\nand looked for the house he wanted.\nThere—in between two of the immense city townhouses owned by the\nwealthy bankers sat a small, austere house with a well-kept garden. Adamat\nheaded up the walk to the house, followed closely by SouSmith.\n“The Reeve, right?” SouSmith asked.\n“Yes.” Ondraus the Reeve. One of Tamas’s councillors, and an architect\nof the coup that overthrew Manhouch. He was a sour, unfriendly old man.\nAdamat did not relish a second meeting. He pounded on the door.\nHe pounded for ten minutes before he finally heard the latch inside\nmove, and the door opened a crack.\n“For a wealthy man,” Adamat said, “I’m surprised you answer the door\nyourself.”\nOndraus the Reeve glared at Adamat through narrowed eyes. “Get off\nmy front step, or I’ll have you jailed for harassment.” Ondraus was wearing\na robe and slippers. His hair was unkempt.\n“I need money,” Adamat said. “Your accountants told me I’ve been cut\noff.”\nOndraus sneered at him. “Tamas is dead. Whatever access to funds he\npromised you is gone. I’d suggest you find employment elsewhere.”\n“See, that’s a problem. May I come in?”\n“No.”\nAdamat leaned on the door. Ondraus started, reeling back into his tiny\nfoyer.\n“Wait out here, please,” Adamat said to SouSmith. The boxer nodded.\nOndraus stormed toward his office. Adamat drew the pistol from his\npocket and cleared his throat.\nThe Reeve froze when he saw the pistol. “What is the meaning of this?”\nhe demanded.\nAdamat drew his eyes across the room. It had changed little in the\nmonths since Adamat’s last visit. The mantel had been dusted, the fireplace\ncleaned, but the carpet showed no more wear and the smells were exactly\nthe same. The house seemed almost unused.\n“I can see through the open door to your office there,” Adamat said, “a\nbell cord. Hardly worth noticing on my last visit, but I find myself\nwondering, in a house with three rooms and no servants, why you have a\nbell cord.” Adamat motioned toward the only chair beside the fireplace.\nOndraus took a seat.\n“Are you here to rob me?” Ondraus said. “All my money is in\ninvestments. As you can see, there’s nothing of worth here. I don’t even\nkeep a checkbook in my home.”"

I don’t even\nkeep a checkbook in my home.”\n“See,” Adamat continued without acknowledging the interruption, “my\nguess is that bell cord leads to a system of rooms beneath your house, and in\none of those rooms you have a permanent staff of four large, dangerous men\nready to come to your defense if you need it. And off of those rooms leads a\ntunnel, likely going to one of these nearby manors that you own under a\nfalse name. You don’t live in it, of course. You just use it to conceal your\ncomings and goings under your other name.”\nOndraus watched Adamat from the chair, saying nothing. His glare was\nless angry now and more… calculating. For some reason the change made\nhim far more frightening.\n“You haven’t yet told me that I’m a dead man,” Adamat said. He\nconsidered Ondraus for a moment. “I suppose you’re not the type.”\n“What is your insurance?” Ondraus asked.\n“Letters. Sent to certain friends I have in the police force.”\n“Telling them that I am the Proprietor?”\nIt was a thrill to hear Ondraus say it out loud. No denial. No admission.\nA simple statement, and it made the hair on the back of Adamat’s neck\nstand up. “No, of course not. Telling them that if I disappear, my body can\nbe found beneath your house. No one wants to investigate the Proprietor.\nBut my friends on the force will have no problem combing through the\naffairs of one accountant. You’re known as a shut-in. Shut-ins are always\ninteresting. My friends might even find it fun. And when they find out\nabout the rooms beneath your house, and the bodyguards, and the manor\nand the huge amounts of money in your portfolio, they will become\nextremely interested indeed.”\nOndraus scoffed. “You think that will save you?”\n“Yes, I do.” Adamat felt a crack in his confidence. What if Ondraus just\ndidn’t care? A man with his connections could just disappear if an\ninvestigation started on him. “I think that my life is a trivial thing to spare,\nif it will save you even a few months’ worth of scrutiny and trouble.\n“If that is not the case,” Adamat added, “I have sent another letter to a\nfriend in the publishing business, telling him I know who the Proprietor is.\nIf I wind up dead, and he hears of an investigation of my death involving\nyou, he’ll draw conclusions and, let me say, he’s not a very smart man. He\nvalues headlines far more than his own life.”\nOndraus began to chuckle. It was a dry sound, and for a moment\nAdamat thought he was coughing. “Very clever,” he said.\n“If you’d given me help, instead of deciding to let me take Vetas on my\nown, I wouldn’t have even wondered about your identity.”\n“You’d have still wondered,” Ondraus said, waving one hand\ndismissively. “What do you want?”\n“Fifty—no, seventy-five thousand krana in cash, and your help killing\nLord Vetas and rescuing my wife.”"

I’m one of the richest men in the Nine.”\n“I’m not interested in your money. I just want to get Faye back.”\n“Vetas still has a Privileged.”\n“That’s what the money is for. If I have the money, I’ll have my own\nPrivileged.”\nOndraus mulled this over. “Resourceful. And if I decide to let you live\nonce Vetas is dead?”\n“I’ll forget you exist.”\n“You surprise me, Adamat,” Ondraus said. His body was no longer\ntensed and angry. He lounged back in the chair, steepling his fingers. “The\nlengths you’re going to. I was warned years ago that you were the most\nprincipled, tenacious man on the Adopest police force. I actually have gone\nto a few small lengths to avoid you.”\n“Believe me,” Adamat said. “If this didn’t involve my family, I wouldn’t\nbe here.”\n“Well, in that case, I have a stipulation. After this is over, you promise to\nwork for me when I have need of you.”\n“No.”\nOndraus held up his hand to forestall the protest. “I’ll pay you, if it\nhappens. The work will likely be dangerous. But agree to this, or I’ll kill\nyou and SouSmith, and see what happens.”\nAdamat searched Ondraus’s eyes. There was an iron resolve there that\ntold him Ondraus would do just that. And maybe… a hint of humor? A\ntouch of a smile on his lips? Was Ondraus enjoying this?\n“Agreed,” Adamat said.\n“Wonderful.” Ondraus paused. “Does SouSmith know?”\n“He thinks I’m here to ask for money,” Adamat said. He left out that\nhe’d told SouSmith he planned on blackmailing the Proprietor. SouSmith\nmight make his own deductions, or he might not. If he did, he was smart\nenough to keep quiet. No need telling Ondraus any of that.\n“You’ll have it tomorrow,” Ondraus said. “I’ll have it delivered to…?”\n“I’ll meet your man in Elections Square. By the stains.”\n“You’re not to come here ever again,” Ondraus said. “Our contact will\nbe through my eunuch. You may go now.”\nAdamat slid his pistol into his pocket with the sudden realization that he\nwas no longer in control.\n“And Adamat,” Ondraus said, “if I ever have need to regret this,\neveryone you’ve ever loved will regret it too.”\nCHAPTER\n21\nA\nt some point during the beating they’d put a black hood over Taniel’s\nhead and now he tripped and struggled as he was shoved through the camp\nby the provosts.

His head pounded, his\nbody a knot of pain.\nThey forced him up a set of stairs and dragged him inside a building. An\ninn? Officers’ mess? He didn’t know. He was thrown into a chair, then tied\ndown. He tried to struggle. The effort earned him a cuff on the back of the\nhead.\nTaniel slumped against his bonds and strained to hear some sound that\nwould tell him his location. Nothing but the chatter of soldiers outside the\nbuilding, too low to hear the voices. He might have been anywhere in the\nAdran camp.\nHow much time passed, he couldn’t be sure. The air grew cooler, so it\nmust have been night. His face was completely numb. They had to have\nbeaten it into a mess. He felt along his teeth. All there. His shirt was soaked\n—probably his own blood, and as he sat there, it grew cold.\nThe numbness in his body began to fade, along with his last powder\ntrance, leaving him to feel the full pain of the beating, when he finally heard\nthe door open. Multiple sets of heavy footsteps. Then another set. Lighter,\nbut no less military.\nHis hood was pulled off. A match was struck and the lanterns on the\nwall lit. The room was no bigger than three yards square and was bare but\nfor two chairs and the lanterns on the wall.\nGeneral Ket stood above him, arms crossed, her face impassive. She was\nflanked by two of her provosts. The men glared at him, cudgels held in such\na way as if they were daring him to move.\n“You’ll need more men,” Taniel said.\nShe seemed taken off guard that he spoke first. “What?”\n“If you’re going to beat me into submission, or whatever it is you’re\nhere to do.”\n“Shut up, Two-Shot.” Ket scratched at the stub of her missing ear and\nthen began to pace. “I should have you shot.”\n“You’ll have to hang me,” Taniel said. He couldn’t help but chuckle.\nShot. These officers all acted like they knew everything, but you can’t put a\npowder mage in front of a firing squad. Not one armed with conventional\nrifles, anyway.\nOne of the provosts put his full weight behind his fist and slammed it\ninto Taniel’s jaw. Taniel’s head snapped to the side and his vision spun. The\nprovost became a fuzzy blur. Taniel hawked a wad of bloody phlegm at the\nprovost, and the man drew back for another punch.\nKet held up a hand. “That’s not necessary, provost.” She rounded on\nTaniel. “Is this a joke to you? You’re looking at being executed!”\n“For what?” Taniel scoffed. “Holding the line?”\n“For what?” she echoed incredulously. Ket stopped her pacing to face\nhim. “Insubordination, conduct unfitting an officer, disobeying direct\norders. Physically assaulting an officer. The way you act verges on treason.”\n“Go to the pit,” Taniel said. He was proud when he didn’t flinch at the\nprovost coming toward him.\nKet stopped the man again."

Treason? Is it treason\nto be the only officer in this bloody army that seems to care about winning a\nbattle? Is it treason to rally the men? Give them something to stand up for?\nYou talk to me about treason, when the trumpets sound a retreat every time\nwe’re about to win a battle.”\n“That’s a lie!” Ket stepped forward, and for a moment Taniel thought\nshe’d hit him herself. “We sound the alarm when the battle goes against us.\nYou’re down on the lines. You don’t see the desperation of the fight where\nyou are.”\nTaniel leaned forward, straining at his bonds. “I don’t see it because I’m\nwinning.” He leaned back. “You’re scared of me. Have you gone over to the\nKez? Is that why? You’re scared I’ll—”\nKet didn’t stop the provost this time. Taniel’s words were cut off by the\nblow, and he was genuinely surprised to find his teeth still there when his\nhead stopped ringing.\nTaniel tasted blood. He swallowed. “Is that why you arrested me in\nsecret?” Taniel spoke around a swollen tongue. “Had me dragged through\nthe camp in a hood? So no one could see me?” Taniel snorted and looked\nthe provost in the eye, daring him to hit again.\nGeneral Ket scratched at her ear. “You are very popular,” she admitted\nas she began to pace again. “But even the popular—someone like you, who\nthe common soldiers call a hero—need to be disciplined. Otherwise the\narmy falls apart. It’s unfortunate, but that’s the way it is. I’d make you a\npublic display, but the other generals don’t agree with me. They think if the\nmen see you flogged, it’ll hurt morale and, Kresimir knows, it’s already low\nenough.”\n“So you’re not going to kill me.”\n“No. At least, not yet. This is your one and only warning.”\n“And you expect an apology?”\n“Indeed. Several, in fact. Starting with Major Doravir, and ending with\nme.”\nTaniel shrugged. “Not going to happen.”\n“Excuse me?” Ket’s eyebrows rose in genuine surprise.\n“I nearly killed a god. I’ve slaughtered dozens of Privileged. Maybe\nover a hundred. I’ve lost count. In the absence of Field Marshal Tamas—by\nthe way, why was I told he was dead? I have it from the mouth of a god that\nhe’s not. Ah, yes. The god we have in our own camp. The god that the high\ncommand are pretending doesn’t exist.\n“Where was I? In the absence of Tamas, I’m your best tool against the\nKez. I’m rallying the men and killing the remaining Kez Privileged and\nWardens. So no. I won’t bloody well apologize to anyone. My father didn’t\nabide fools. I may not like my father much, but we share that in common.”\nGeneral Ket remained silent through the whole speech. Taniel was\nsurprised by that. He expected to be cut off by a provost’s fist halfway in."

He expected to be cut off by a provost’s fist halfway in.\nHe was ready to spit the words through his broken jaw if he had to.\n“Tamas is lost to us,” Ket said. “There’s no way he’ll survive in Kez. It’s\nbetter to assume he’s dead. And as for Mihali… if he wasn’t so popular\namong the men, we’d have him removed. He’s a very persuasive madman,\nnothing more.”\n“Then why are we fighting this war at all?” Taniel asked. “If Kresimir is\non the Kez side, we can’t win. Unless. Ah. Unless you don’t think Kresimir\nis there at all. You don’t think any of this supernatural stuff is real.”\n“I believe what I see with my own eyes,” Ket said. “I see two opposing\narmies. If there was a god present, we’d all be dead. Now.” She paused to\ndrag a chair over in front of Taniel and sat down, crossing her legs. “The\nthreat of physical pain obviously means nothing to you. Death?” She\nexamined him for a moment. “No, not that either.”\nShe continued. “This is what’s going to happen: Your records will be\ntransferred to the Third Brigade. You’ll keep your rank—but commanding a\ncompany of picked riflemen who will take on the tasks I assign. No more of\nthis mucking about on the front line. You’re not an infantryman.”\n“You want your own pet powder mage, eh?”\nKet went on as if she hadn’t noticed him speak. “You’ll apologize to\nMajor Doravir. In public. After which you will read a prepared note—again,\nin public—that apologizes for your misconduct and swear on your father’s\ngrave that you will keep the regulations of the Adran army.”\n“I’ll do no such thing.”\n“The savage girl is no longer to share your room. I don’t approve of\nsuch illicit relationships among my officers. Especially not with a savage.”\nTaniel sneered. “There’s nothing illicit going on.”\n“I wasn’t finished! The girl will be placed with the laundresses of the\nThird. You’ll be allowed to speak with her ten minutes each day. No more.”\n“That’s preposterous!” Taniel leaned forward. “She’s not Adran army,\nshe’s—”\nHe was silenced by the provost’s fist. The blow nearly knocked him\nover, but the other provost stepped up and held the chair steady.\n“Do not interrupt me again,” Ket said coldly. “I’ve put up with your\ninsubordination long enough. Rumors are the girl is some kind of sorcerer.\nI’ll have her watched. If she attempts to leave the camp, she’ll be beaten. If\nshe attempts to find you, she’ll be beaten. Understand? Oh, and before you\nsay anything—yes, I can keep her here. This is a time of war. Conscription\nis a reality.”\nTaniel waited for a few moments before speaking. “I’ll kill any man who\nlays a hand on her.”\n“You make any threat you want, but you can’t protect her all the time.\nYou’ll do all these things for me, or I’ll hand your girl over to the Dredgers."

The scum of the Third. Men so low that\nthe Mountainwatch wouldn’t take them. I reform such men, and if I don’t\nsucceed, I execute them.” General Ket stood up and walked over until she\nwas right next to Taniel. She whispered, “I don’t approve of rape, nor\nencourage it. But I understand it’s a powerful psychological tool, and don’t\nthink I won’t give your little savage girl to the Dredgers to do with what\nthey will.”\nTaniel wondered if he could kill her right then. He’d have to use his\nteeth to do it. Tear out her throat. The provosts could be fast enough to stop\nhim. But it might be worth a try.\n“I’m not a monster, Captain. I’m not doing this on a whim. It is my duty\nto impose order upon this camp and I will do it even if it costs your little\nsavage her innocence. Do you understand?”\nTaniel felt the fury leave him. He wouldn’t—he couldn’t subject Ka-poel\nto that.\n“Yes,” he said.\nGeneral Ket headed toward the door. “Untie him. Clean him up. He’s\nconfined to quarters until he apologizes to Major Doravir.”\nTamas watched the slow march of his column as they emerged from the\ntrees of Hune Dora Forest and onto the floodplain of the river known\nlocally as the Big Finger.\nThe plain was perhaps a half mile across, from the forest to the edge of\nthe river. The ground was rocky, but not overly so, and filled with rich,\nsandy silt. During a wet summer it might have been impassable by large\nnumbers of cavalry and so given them a greater advantage, but as it was, the\nplain was dry and hard.\nThe Big Finger was the first in a succession of mountain-fed rivers\ncollectively known as the Fingers of Kresimir. It was deep and fast-flowing\nand impossible to cross without sturdy rafts that could be pushed across and\nland on the other side farther downstream. Or by way of the bridge.\nThe bridge was nowhere to be seen.\nTamas heard the cries of dismay as the news was passed on down the\ncolumn. He felt a twinge of pain for his men. They were starving, tired,\nbeaten by the heat, and they’d just arrived at their one hope of delivery and\nfound it gone.\nThey didn’t know that Tamas had ordered the bridge destroyed.\nAcross the floodplain, near the river, Tamas could see smoldering\nbonfires. Flanks of meat roasted above them, the last of the horses taken\nfrom the Kez a week ago. Enough for a meal for ten thousand men.\nGavril rode across the floodplain, and Tamas noted he’d kept his own\nhorse alive. He gave Tamas a salute, then said loudly, “Damned bridge\nwashed away.”\n“Bloody pit!” Tamas slapped a fist into the palm of one hand.\nGavril went on. “We slaughtered the rest of the horses and scouted for\nwood for rafts. I’ll need men to build them.”"

Gather the officers so I can brief them.”\n“Yes, sir.” Olem flicked his reins and headed down the column, slumped\nin his saddle like a boy whose dog had just died.\nGavril brought his horse up closer to Tamas. “What the pit did you say\nto that man? I’ve not seen someone look that guilty since the Lady\nFemore’s face when her husband caught me in bed with her and his sister.”\n“I told him I didn’t want him continuing relations with Vlora.”\nTamas watched Olem as he shouted for men to help him distribute food.\nHe’d have to keep it organized. Eleven thousand hungry men were liable to\nstart a riot. “I ordered Vlora to stop as well. She… vehemently…\ndisobeyed.” Tamas couldn’t tolerate that kind of insubordination, not in a\ntime of war. He didn’t know what he was going to do about that. He’d been\navoiding it for two days.\nGavril let out a loud guffaw and slapped his knee. Tamas thought about\nreaching across and punching him off his horse, but decided against it.\nWouldn’t want to risk breaking his neck, even if it would have done him\ngood.\n“Did everything go smoothly?” Tamas asked in a low voice, jerking his\nhead toward the river.\n“It did,” Gavril said. “Knocked out the bridge yesterday, though the boys\nweren’t happy about it. I can’t promise they won’t say anything.”\n“Last thing I need is rumors going around that I gave the order.”\n“I’ll do my best to keep them quiet,” Gavril said, “but if this turns into a\ndeath trap, I’m going to curse your name with my dying breath.” The\nexpression he wore told Tamas he was only partially joking.\n“That seems fair. How close are the cuirassiers?”\n“My outriders say a day.” Gavril scratched his beard. “I hope you’re\ncertain about this. We could have gotten the army across the river and been\nsafe for another two weeks, foraging and resting, and then faced them on\nthe north side of the Fingers in better shape.”\n“I am certain,” Tamas said. He looked to the west. The Big Finger\nmeandered out of sight behind Hune Dora Forest about a mile downriver.\nTomorrow he’d have a whole brigade of heavy cavalry riding upstream on\nthat floodplain. He’d be boxed in and outnumbered. “I won’t face three\nbrigades of cavalry under Beon je Ipille on the open plains of the Northern\nExpanse. It would be suicide, even for me. Are you coming to my\nmeeting?”\nGavril looked toward the bonfires. “I’ll give Olem a hand organizing\nlunch.”\n“Good. The men will need their strength.

I’m putting them to work next.\nIt’s going to be a long night.”\nTamas rode toward the gathering of his officers, only a stone’s throw\nfrom the river. Some of them were still on horseback. The rest were on foot,\nhaving given their mounts over to Gavril’s rangers two weeks ago.\nHe ran his eyes over the assembled men. Every one of his generals,\ncolonels, and majors were present. He dismounted.\n“Gentlemen,” he said. “Gather round. Forgive me for not providing\nrefreshment. I left my god-chef back in Budwiel.”\nThe comment received a few forced chuckles. Tamas felt his heart fall a\nlittle and made himself reevaluate his officers. They were a sorry lot. They\nwere gaunt and unshaven, their uniforms dirty. Several wore the fresh scars\nof their skirmishes with Kez dragoons. Those still in possession of their\nhorses had followed his example and given the better portion of their rations\nto the marching soldiers. They were tired, hungry, and he could see the fear\nin their eyes. Fear that hadn’t been so stark before finding out the bridge\nwas gone.\n“As you can see, the bridge we’d hoped to cross to escape our pursuers\nis washed away. This has forced me to make a change in our plans. The Kez\ndragoons will be here in full force by the end of the day. The cuirassiers will\nbe here tomorrow.”\n“That’s not enough time to get everyone across the river,” someone said.\nTamas searched for the source of the voice. It was a major, commandant\nof the quartermasters of the Ninth Brigade. He was missing his epaulets,\nand he bore a two-day-old gash across the bridge of his nose, the congealed\nblood almost black.\n“No, it’s not,” Tamas admitted.\nA clamor of voices went up. Tamas sighed. On a normal day these were\nhis best officers. Not one of them would have interrupted him. Today was\nnot a normal day.\nHe raised his hand. A few moments passed, but the hubbub died down.\n“A panicked crossing of the river on hastily made rafts will leave our\narmy fractured and in disarray. Beon’s dragoon commanders would not\nhesitate to attack en masse the moment they arrived. So we’re going to wait,\nand make a panicked crossing of the river tomorrow afternoon.”\nHis officers stared back at him, uncomprehending. No one said a word\nuntil Colonel Arbor flexed his jaw and popped his false teeth into one hand.\n“You’re setting a trap,” Arbor said.\n“Precisely.”\n“How can we set a trap for half again our number of cavalry?” protested\nGeneral Cethal of the Ninth Brigade. He was a stout man of medium height.\nHe had a particular wariness for cavalry, since a flanking maneuver by\nGurlish cavalry had cost him two regiments and his left eye ten years ago.\n“By making ourselves a ripe target.” Tamas picked up a straight stick\nand cleared away some of the tall grass so he could draw in the sandy dirt of\nthe floodplain.\n“But we are a ripe target,” General Cethal said.\nTamas ignored him. “Here is our position.” He drew a line to represent"

The larger number of dragoons,\nfrom the south. General Cethal, what is the first thing we teach prospective\nofficers at the academy?”\n“Terrain is key.”\n“Indeed.”\n“But sir,” General Cethal insisted, “you’ve put us on a flat floodplain\nwith almost seventeen thousand cavalry bearing down on us. I can’t think of\nmany worse situations.”\n“We have our backs to the river,” Tamas said. “And we have significant\nmanpower. The terrain will be very different tomorrow.”\n“You mean to shape the terrain to your needs?” General Cethal shook\nhis head. “It can’t be done. We’d need a week to prepare.”\nTamas stared hard at General Cethal. “Expecting defeat will surely bring\nit,” he said quietly.\n“I’m sorry, sir,” Cethal said.\nTamas took a moment to look each officer in the eye before going on.\n“The ancient Deliv, back before the Time of Kresimir, were foreigners to\nthe Nine. Our own ancestors were just some of the barbarians the Deliv\nfaced. The Deliv had barely a fraction of the fighting men, but they were\nbetter organized. A Deliv legion could march thirty miles and create an\nentire fortification to camp all in one day. They survived because they had\nthe discipline and the will. We shall do the same.”\nAs he spoke, Tamas had been drawing lines in the dirt with his stick. He\npointed at one line. “The soil is somewhat rocky, but the dirt is loose and\neasy to dig.” He pointed to a series of Xs. “Hune Dora Forest has an\nabundance of wood.”\nColonel Arbor squatted beside the crude drawing and examined it for a\nmoment. He suddenly laughed. “It might work. Should I get my boys\ndigging?”\n“Your battalion has the first rest. We’ll be working all night, so it’ll be\ndone in shifts. Then you’ll chop trees. General Cethal, your men will be\ndigging.”\n“My men? The Ninth?”\n“Yes. All of them.”\n“Do you intend to create a palisade?” General Cethal asked.\n“Not quite,” Tamas said. “Get digging. I’ll come around in an hour and\ngive each company specific instructions.” He made a shooing gesture with\nhis stick. “Get to work.”\nTamas watched his officers head off toward their men. It was going to be\na long night. He hoped that when morning came, and battle was joined, his\nefforts would be worth it. Otherwise he would have exhausted all of his\nmen for nothing.\n“Mihali,” he whispered to himself, “if you’re still with us… I need some\nhelp.”\nIt was the closest thing to a prayer he’d ever spoken.\nAdamat and SouSmith watched the abandoned manor where Privileged\nBorbador was being kept. The street was empty, the air silent. Dark clouds\nthreatened on the southern horizon, and the wind was beginning to pick up.\nThey were in for a stormy night."

Dark clouds\nthreatened on the southern horizon, and the wind was beginning to pick up.\nThey were in for a stormy night.\nThere were no signs of Verundish’s soldiers in the manor. Adamat\nwasn’t sure whether that was a good thing or not. He’d left the money\nyesterday at an address the Deliv colonel had given him. He couldn’t help\nbut think of all the things that could go wrong, or wonder whether she had\ntaken the money and simply changed where they were hiding Bo.\nAdamat headed down the hill and navigated the ruin until he found the\nservants’ quarters. Bedding was gone, debris picked up. The only sign\nsoldiers had ever been there was warm ashes in one of the fireplaces.\nAdamat grew more nervous with each step. Was it all for naught,\nblackmailing the Proprietor and gathering the money?\nThe door to the room where they’d kept Bo was closed. He turned the\nknob and stepped inside.\nPrivileged Borbador was gone. The chair, the bed, even the stand and the\nbook were still there, but Bo was gone.\n“Bloody pit!” Adamat kicked over the book stand. “That bloody…” He\ndropped into the chair, head in his hands. She’d just taken the money and\nleft, just like that. And with her, Privileged Borbador, and any hope Adamat\nhad of getting his wife back.\nSouSmith leaned in the doorway, watching Adamat with a frown.\n“What’ll you do?” he asked.\nAdamat wanted to gouge his own eyes out. What could he do? He\nthought he’d known despair, but this…\nThe hall floorboards creaked. SouSmith turned. Adamat pulled the pistol\nfrom his pocket. If that was Verundish, he’d shoot her without a second\nthought.\nBo stepped past SouSmith and into the room. His hair was brushed back,\nhis lapels straightened, and his beard shaved and styled into thick\nmuttonchops.\nAdamat felt the strength go from his limbs. He slumped back in the chair\nand stared at the Privileged.\n“I thought you looked beat up the last time we spoke,” Bo said. “What\nhappened to your nose?”\n“I’m going to hit the next person who asks me that.” As long as they\nweren’t a Privileged, Adamat added silently.\nBo gave a thin smile. “Thank you,” he said, “for getting me released.\nThey treated me well enough, but no one likes being tied up like that, not\neven able to move my hands.” He flexed his fingers. “So stiff.”\n“You’re welcome,” Adamat said. “Now you’ll hold up your part of the\nbargain?”\n“I have some things to do.” Bo stepped to the window and looked out.\nAdamat felt his chest tighten. Things to do? “I need you now.”\n“You’ll have me tomorrow.”\n“You’re not going anywhere without me,” Adamat said. “I need to make\nsure I have your help.”\n“You don’t trust me?”\n“I can’t afford to,” Adamat said.\n“If I decide to ignore our deal, you wouldn’t be able to stop me.” It\nwasn’t a question, but a statement."

Twenty? Maybe twenty-two? His eyes\nwere so much older, like a man who’d seen more than his share of suffering\nand lived to talk about it.\n“Suit yourself,” Bo said.\n“You’ll only need one night?”\n“Yes.”\n“SouSmith,” Adamat said, “go to Sergeant Oldrich, and then the eunuch.\nTell them I plan on acting tomorrow, then meet me at the safe house.”\nThe big boxer nodded and left.\nAdamat followed Bo out into the street. The Privileged walked with a\npurpose, like he had things to do, his head held high and his eyes alert. They\nhad to walk for half an hour before they found a carriage. Bo gave the\ndriver directions and they got inside.\n“The eunuch,” Bo said, taking his hands out of his pockets. Adamat\nrealized he wasn’t wearing Privileged’s gloves. “As in ‘the Proprietor’s\neunuch’?”\nAdamat smoothed the front of his coat. “Indeed.”\n“That’s a dangerous friend you have. The cabal tried to kill him a couple\ntimes. Failed, obviously.”\n“The Proprietor or the eunuch?”\n“The eunuch,” Bo said. “The Proprietor had an uneasy truce with the\ncabal, but Zakary never liked the eunuch. Didn’t try to kill him again after a\nPrivileged he sent after the eunuch wound up dead.”\n“The eunuch killed a Privileged?”\n“It’s not common knowledge,” Bo said, “but yes.” The Privileged fell\nsilent for the rest of their trip, looking out the window and fingering\nsomething beneath his jacket.\nThe demon’s carbuncle, Adamat guessed. The jewel around his neck that\nwould eventually kill him if he didn’t avenge the death of Manhouch.\n“We’re here,” Bo suddenly said.\nThey climbed out of the carriage in the middle of Bakerstown. The air\nsmelled of hot bread and meat pies, making Adamat’s mouth water. “I’m\ngoing to get something to eat,” he said, stopping beside a pie vendor.\n“Get me one too,” Bo replied, “then come upstairs.” He disappeared\ninside a squat brick building sandwiched between two bakeries.\nAdamat paid for two meat pies and followed Bo inside. When he\nreached the top of the stairs, he found himself in a one-room flat. There was\na table and a bed, with an old mattress stuffed with straw, and one window\nlooking out into an alley behind the bakery.\nBo stood on a chair in the middle of the room, pressing his fingers\ngently against the ceiling.\n“What are you doing?”\nBo didn’t answer him, but hit the ceiling once, hard. The plaster gave\nway and a box suddenly dropped into the room, hitting the floor with a\ncrash.\nAdamat waved plaster dust away from his face as Bo opened the box.\nInside was a pair of Privileged’s gloves and what appeared to be thousands\nof crisp banknotes, bundled together by silk ribbon."

I came off the streets\noriginally.”\n“So… a box in the ceiling?”\n“I’m not stupid. The wards on this box will blow anyone that’s not me\nhalfway across the room if they touch it.”\n“Ah.”\n“How much did you pay Verundish to let me go?”\n“Why?”\n“How much?”\n“Seventy-five thousand,” Adamat said.\nBo handed him two stacks of banknotes. “Here’s a hundred.”\n“I can’t take these,” Adamat said, trying to give them back. “I still need\nyour help, I…”\nBo rolled his eyes. “Take them. I’ll still help you. I don’t care how you\ngot the money, but it couldn’t have been easy. I pay my debts back double,\nwhen I can.”\nAdamat only put the banknotes in his pockets when he realized Bo\nwasn’t going to take no for an answer. At a quick guess, Bo had over a\nmillion krana in that box. It was a mind-boggling number for a man like\nAdamat. But to a man like Bo, who’d been a member of the royal cabal, it\nwas probably a trifle.\nThe Privileged bundled it all up in brown paper and wrapped it with a\nbow like it was one big package he’d just acquired at the store, keeping\nback four stacks of krana and secreting them about his person. When he was\nfinished, he stood and nodded to Adamat. “Let’s go.”\nBo wouldn’t let Adamat come with him inside the next time they\nstopped, nor the time after that. It was the fourth stop, well after dark, when\nAdamat finally got curious enough to follow him.\nThey were in one of the more pleasant parts of town, where the growing\nmiddle class lived in smart, two-story houses and walked the line between\nthe nobility and the poor. It was not unlike where Adamat himself lived, if a\nlittle more crowded.\nBo left the carriage and headed down a long alley between two tenement\nbuildings of spacious flats. Adamat waited for a moment before slipping out\nafter him.\nHe paused by the edge of the alley, watching around the corner, as Bo\nknocked on a door. A moment later he was admitted inside.\nAdamat inched his way down the alley until he reached a window\nlooking into the flat.\nInside, he could see a pair of children playing next to a large fireplace. A\nboy and a girl, maybe eight and ten years of age. The window was open to\ntake advantage of the stiff evening winds. Adamat moved to the next\nwindow that looked into a kitchen.\nA man with a long mustache and burly shoulders stood next to the\nkitchen table, frowning at Bo. The woman sat at the table, busy with her\nknitting."

The woman sat at the table, busy with her\nknitting.\n“Just ten minutes of your time,” Bo was saying. He drew a stack of\nbanknotes from his pocket and tossed it on the table.\nThe woman dropped her knitting needles and held a hand to her mouth.\nThe man sputtered over the amount. Bo drew another stack and added it to\nthe first.\n“Whatever you say,” the man said. “Just let me get my coat.”\nThe door opened, and Adamat was forced to press himself against the\nwall, hoping the darkness would conceal him from Bo’s eyes.\nBo followed the man out into the alleyway and gestured for him to come\ndown farther. They weren’t ten feet from Adamat when they stopped.\n“Now what’s this all about?” the man asked.\nBo lifted his gloved fingers in the air and snapped them.\nThe man’s head twisted around a hundred and eighty degrees. Bo deftly\nstepped out of the way as the body staggered and fell. He seemed to regard\nthe dead man for a few moments before he turned and headed back toward\nthe carriage.\nAdamat couldn’t help himself. He’d seen gruesome murders in his time,\nand bad men do terrible things, but the abruptness… He stepped from the\ndarkness. “What the pit is the meaning of this?” he hissed.\n“Keep walking.” Bo grabbed him by the arm in a surprisingly firm grip\nand spun him about, pushing him toward the carriage.\nAdamat had no choice but to allow himself to be dragged along. The\ncarriage was soon heading down the street, and Adamat struggled to find a\nvoice to express what he’d just seen. The murder had been quick and cold.\nA trained assassin couldn’t have done it better.\n“Here,” Bo said. He grasped something beneath his shirt and yanked,\nthen tossed it into Adamat’s lap. “Take this. I don’t want the bloody thing\nanymore.”\nAdamat stared down at the ruby-red jewel sitting in his lap. “Is that the\ndemon’s carbuncle?” He wasn’t sure if he wanted to touch it.\n“It is,” Bo said.\n“I thought you had to kill Tamas,” Adamat said. “How did…?”\nBo looked rather pleased with himself. Not at all like someone who’d\njust snapped a man’s neck not two dozen paces from his wife and children.\n“I had to avenge the king. That man there was the headsman who loaded\nManhouch into the guillotine.”\nAdamat finally drew a handkerchief from his pocket and lifted the jewel\nto see it better by the light of the streetlamps outside the carriage. It was\nwarm—no, hot—to the touch and seemed to throb with its own inner light.\nHe wondered how much a jeweler would pay for a sorcerous piece of art\nlike this.\n“Gorgeous, isn’t it?” Bo said.\n“It can’t have been that simple. A god made the precedence for the gaes.\nYou can’t just kill the executioner and have it be all. Can you?”\n“Kresimir was just a man,” Bo said. His eyes narrowed as if at\nsomething that made him angry. “Just a damned man with a bloody huge"

He may be smarter than most, and have more time to\nthink and plan, but even the so-called gods make mistakes.”\n“Is this thing… safe?” Adamat asked.\n“Quite.”\nAdamat wrapped it in his handkerchief and put it in his pocket. “Why\ndidn’t you just tell Tamas?”\n“I wasn’t sure,” Bo said. “I only had the thought recently, and I would\nhave looked a damn fool if his soldiers had killed an innocent man only for\nthe carbuncle not to come off.”\n“You weren’t sure? What the bloody pit kind of man—?”\nBo held up his hand and gave Adamat a cold, long stare. “At what point\nhave you ever gotten the impression that there are good people in the royal\ncabal?”\n“You’ve given me that impression,” Adamat said. He swallowed hard.\n“Yes. You have.”\n“Well, get past it.” Bo turned toward the carriage window. “Because I’m\nnot a good man. Not in the slightest. I just pay my debts.”\nAdamat watched the Privileged for several minutes. Was that regret in\nhis voice? A frown at the edges of his mouth? It was impossible to tell.\nMembers of the royal cabal were dangerous men, he reminded himself, and\nwere not to be trusted.\nHe just hoped that Bo really was on his side.\nCHAPTER\n22\nT\namas judged he had two hours before night fell and the Kez dragoons\nwould be close enough to scout his position.\nThe sound of his soldiers chopping great trees on the edge of the Hune\nDora Forest echoed across the floodplains, and teams of men dragged the\ntrees by hand across the dusty grassland to where Tamas had decided to\nmake his stand. Closer, the scrape of a thousand shovels on sandy dirt made\nTamas’s skin crawl. He hated that sound. It felt like someone scraping a nail\nacross his molars.\nHe found Andriya cleaning his rifle down near the river. The Marked’s\nbelt had become decorated with squirrel tails over the last few days. He\ndidn’t have the same look as the rest of the soldiers. His cheeks were\nslightly rounded from eating well and his face lacked the lines of\nexhaustion.\nHis eyes, though, betrayed him. They were wide and bright, shifting\nconstantly. Like the rest of Tamas’s mages, Andriya had been floating in a\npowder trance for weeks running. It was a terribly dangerous thing to do.\nGoing powder blind could see any of the mages dizzy, disoriented,\nunconscious, or even dead.\n“I’d back off on the powder, soldier,” Tamas said gently.\nAndriya looked him up and down. His lips twisted, and for a moment\nTamas thought Andriya would snap at him.\n“Right, sir,” Andriya said. “Probably should.”\n“Where is Vlora?”\nAndriya shrugged. Tamas couldn’t help but wonder where the discipline\nwas going in his army.\n“What was that?”\n“Don’t know, sir.”\n“Find her.”\n“She won’t talk to you, sir.”\n“Come again, soldier?”"

This wouldn’t do. This wouldn’t do at all. He\nquickly thought over his options. He could have her flogged. Had a regular\nsoldier said something like that to him, he wouldn’t have hesitated. Vlora\nwas… was what? Another time, he might have thought she was kin. But\nshe’d made it clear that was no longer the case.\nBesides, a public flogging on the eve of a major battle? He rolled his\neyes to himself. That would help morale.\nHe could give her a public reprimand. What if she defied him? He’d\nhave no choice but to impose more severe punishment. With her temper, he\nmight have to have her hanged.\n“Get the powder cabal together,” Tamas said. “I’ve got assignments for\nyou. Tell Vlora to be there.”\nAndriya saluted and went about cleaning his rifle. Tamas headed toward\nthe bonfires to find something to eat.\nThe soldiers had been organized into lines. Olem stood at the head of the\nlines along with the better part of his Riflejacks—all trusted men that could\nkeep the infantry in line. The last of the horsemeat was distributed quickly\nas soldiers approached with their pewter dishes.\nThe camp was coming together even as work continued on Tamas’s\npreparations. Tents were pitched, small fires made. Parties were sent out to\nforage the woods or fish the river. Fights broke out and were quickly put\ndown, only to start up again somewhere else. Food seemed to be the main\ninstigator as soldiers tried to get in line for seconds. The meat might keep\nthem going through the night, but morale was low, and the food wouldn’t\nlast through tomorrow.\n“Sir.”\nAndriya’s voice broke through Tamas’s thoughts. Nineteen men and\nwomen stood assembled before him: the entirety of his powder cabal,\nincluding the recruits Sabon had managed to gather before his death.\n“We’re running low on powder and bullets,” Tamas said without\npreamble. He caught sight of Vlora at the back of the group, but did not\nwait to hold her eye. “Tomorrow we’ll be fighting almost sixteen thousand\ncavalry. I’m setting a trap that should even the odds, but it’s going to be a\nbrutal battle.”\nTamas looked around, suddenly feeling weary. His leg ached. He\nthought to take some powder, but stopped himself. Save it for the soldiers.\nHe walked to a large rock and sat down, gesturing for the powder mages to\nbe at ease. Most of them sat on the sandy ground. Vlora remained standing,\nher arms crossed. Tamas ignored her.\n“I’m going to redistribute bullets and powder among the men so that you\nhave enough for the next twenty-four hours. Your first job: Do not let Kez\nscouts get within a half mile of us. Do not let them take the high ground\nalong the mountain.” He pointed east to the slope of the Adran Mountains."

Do not let them take the high ground\nalong the mountain.” He pointed east to the slope of the Adran Mountains.\n“Do not let them see what we’re up to. The life of every soldier depends on\nthis.\n“However,” he went on, “I want them to see we’re doing something. A\nlittle digging. Preparations and rafts. Perhaps trying to rebuild the bridge.\nEvery so often, let one of their scouts get closer, and then let him get away\nwith a bullet in the arm, or something equally convincing.”\n“Tomorrow should be much of the same. I expect Beon to attack as soon\nas his cuirassiers arrive. He knows an opportunity when he sees one, and he\nnever hesitates to take it.”\n“And if he senses the trap?” Andriya asked.\n“Then we cross the river tomorrow night, and deal with Beon on the\nother side of the Fingers.” Tamas had a very good feeling that would not be\nthe case. Beon needed to stop them now. The farther north they got, the\nbetter chance they had of finding succor in Deliv and crossing back into\nAdro. Tamas prayed that would spur on Beon. He dreaded the idea of facing\nthe Kez on the open plains of the Northern Expanse.\n“We’ll have teams,” Tamas said. “Nine and three. Nine on watch, killing\nKez scouts, and three resting.”\n“We don’t need rest,” Andriya said. He grinned at Tamas. His crooked\nteeth were stained yellow. “We just need powder.”\nTamas held his hand up toward Andriya. “You’ll have your time to kill\nKez,” he said. “You all need some rest tonight.”\nIt was perhaps six o’clock, and the hot sun burned red over the Amber\nExpanse to the west. Tamas wondered if the coming night would be his last\nin this world.\nThe Kez outnumbered him. He was growing old. Not as fast or as sharp\nas he’d once been. Beon might see through the trap and outmaneuver him,\nor circle at a distance, content to pick off Tamas’s troops until Tamas made\nit across the river, then head west around the Fingers and wait for Tamas on\nthe Northern Expanse.\nHad it been a mistake to order Gavril to destroy the bridge?\n“Sir?”\nTamas jolted out of his reverie. The powder mages were gone, all but\nVlora. For a moment he imagined she was a little girl again—ten years old\n—seeking his approval. The sun had sunk in the western sky and the camp\nwas completely pitched. The bonfires had burned low, all sign of the horse\ncarcasses gone. Thousands of men worked on the floodplain while\nthousands more chopped trees on the edge of the Hune Dora Forest.\n“Where are they?”\n“Sir?”\n“The powder mages.”\nVlora had a hint of worry in her eyes. “You dismissed them over an hour\nago. Told me to stay.”\n“And you’ve been waiting this whole time?”\n“You seemed preoccupied.”\nTamas took a shaky breath. He suddenly remembered dismissing\nAndriya and the rest of the mages, but it was like looking back in time\nthrough a thick fog.\nGetting old indeed."

He suddenly remembered dismissing\nAndriya and the rest of the mages, but it was like looking back in time\nthrough a thick fog.\nGetting old indeed.\n“Have you been eating, sir?”\nTamas’s stomach growled. “I had some horsemeat earlier.”\n“I was watching you, sir. You didn’t take anything when you went to\ncheck on the bonfires.”\n“I’m sure I did.”\nVlora dug in her belt, then handed him a white tuber. “Found these\ntruffles in the forest yesterday. You should eat. Take them, Tamas.”\nTamas put out a hand reluctantly and she dropped them there.\nHe hesitated, staring at the truffles. Truffles grown in forests of the\nAdran Mountains were delicacies in most of the Nine. They were small and\npale-cream colored. He’d never much liked truffles.\n“Thank you,” he said.\nVlora leaned on her rifle, staring over toward the forest. He gazed at the\nside of her face. He’d watched her grow from a fledgling powder mage into\na capable soldier, one of his best. She was strong, with a beauty that the\nyears would dim but never fully diminish. He felt a pang of loss, once\nagain, that this girl would never bear him a grandson. He looked again at\nthe truffles in his hand.\n“What I said, Tamas—sir, I shouldn’t have spoken to you that way. Not\nin front of the men.”\n“No, you shouldn’t have.”\nVlora stiffened. “I’ll accept whatever reprimand you see fit.”\nTamas didn’t know his heart was capable of breaking. Not after all these\nyears. He took a deep breath. “You’re a grown woman. Olem is a good\nman. He’ll make you happy.”\nShe seemed surprised by this. But not in the way Tamas expected. “He’s\njust another man,” she said. “Someone to warm the nights.” She closed her\neyes. “We’re soldiers. Tomorrow, one of us might be dead. Even if we both\nsurvive the battle, we’ll move on and find others. It’s the life we’ve\nchosen.” Her eyes opened again and she looked across the camp. “All of\nus.”\nAh. What every soldier knew so well. Lovers were brief, passion\nburning like a candle—hot at the center and easily doused. It was too hard\nto keep the flame kindled longer than a season or a campaign. “It can be a\nlonely life,” Tamas agreed.\n“You think we can win tomorrow?” Vlora asked.\nTamas looked toward the forest. At his soldiers going about their tasks.\nThey were dragging trees across the floodplains now, toward the camp. The\nsound of billhooks hitting wood carried in the night. A rifle fired\nsomewhere. Soldiers foraging, or powder mages scaring off Kez scouts?\n“I think we can win every battle,” Tamas said. “This… this will be\ndifficult. The whole fulcrum of my plan could topple if the Kez catch too\ngood a look at my preparations. We are low on powder and bullets, and the\nmen are half-starved. We have to win tomorrow, or we’ll die here.”"

She hugged her rifle.\n“Neither do I.”\n“Sir.”\n“Yes?”\n“Gavril… he said you buried someone beside the Little Finger, long ago.\nWho was it?”\nTamas felt himself whisked away. Felt the spray of the raging river on\nhis face, the mud and blood caked on his fingers from digging a grave by\nhand.\nHe forced himself to stand, trying not to favor his bad leg. It needed the\nexercise. “I’ve buried countless friends. More enemies. Kin, and those close\nenough they might as well be. I want to see Adro again. I want to know if\nmy son survived his ordeals. But before then, there is a lot of work to do.\nThat is all, Captain. Dismissed.”\nTaniel sat brooding in his quarters, watching out the window as a line of\nwagons carried wounded soldiers away from the front. He thought about\nopening the window and asking how the battle was going. But he already\nhad a guess: badly. This lot had probably taken a mortar round—their\nwounds were bloody and varied, and by their uniforms they were all from\nthe same company.\nGeneral Ket had sent him to an inn about five miles behind the line,\nunder guard twenty-four hours a day. It seemed like weeks since Ket had\ngiven Taniel her ultimatum. He knew it had been a single night.\nThe provosts had demanded to know where Ka-poel was. Taniel had\nshrugged and told them to stuff it, but inside he’d worried about what\nthey’d do when they caught her. Had they been given orders to give her a\nbeating like the one they’d given Taniel? Or worse? Without dolls of them,\nwould Ka-poel be able to fend off the provosts?\nGeneral Ket had come by his quarters early this morning to tell him that\nevery day he refused to apologize to Major Doravir was another day that\nmen died on the line.\nTaniel would be up there now if it weren’t for General Ket. He wouldn’t\nlet her convince him it was his fault that the line was being pushed back\nagain.\nOutside his window, Taniel caught sight of a young man. It was a boy,\nreally. Couldn’t have been more than fifteen. His leg had been taken off at\nthe knee. Whether by a cannonball or a surgeon, Taniel didn’t know, but he\nwas struck by the calm on the boy’s face. While men three times his age\nwailed over any number of flesh wounds, the boy sat stoically in the back of\na wagon, his stump hanging off the edge, watching serenely while a fresh\ngroup of conscripts were sent to the front.\nTaniel lifted his sketchbook and began to outline the boy’s face.\nA knock sounded at the door. Taniel ignored it, wanting to give the boy’s\nportrait some shape so that he could finish it later.\nHe’d almost forgotten there even had been a knock, when it sounded\nagain. The wagon outside was moving on, and the wounded boy with it."

The big chef held a silver platter\naloft in one hand, a towel over the opposite arm. His apron was dirty with\nflour and what looked like smudges of chocolate.\n“Sorry to bother you,” Mihali said, sweeping past Taniel. Two provosts\nfollowed the chef inside. One held a folding table, the other a bottle of\nwine. “Right there,” Mihali told them. “Next to the window. Now some\nprivacy, please.”\nThe provosts grumbled, setting up the table and then retreating into the\nhallway.\n“Sit,” Mihali instructed, pointing at the only chair in the room. He\ndeposited himself on the edge of the bed.\n“What’s this?” Taniel asked.\n“Dinner.” Mihali swept the lid off the silver tray. “Braised side of beef\nwith quail’s egg quiche and sweet goat cheese, and served with a red wine.\nNothing fancy, I’m afraid, but the wine is a lovely ’forty-seven and has\nbeen chilled.”\nNothing fancy? The smell rising from the platter made Taniel shudder\nwith pleasure. His mouth watered immediately, and he found himself at the\ntable unable to remember sitting down, with a piece of beef already on his\nfork. He paused. “May I?”\n“Please, please,” Mihali encouraged. He popped the wine cork and\npoured two glasses.\nIt was a little unnerving that Mihali watched him while he ate, but Taniel\nquickly learned to ignore the chef’s presence and was soon reaching for\nseconds.\n“What,” Taniel asked, eyeing Mihali, who was on his third glass of\nwine, “is the occasion?”\nMihali poured Taniel another glass. “Occasion? Does there need to be an\noccasion to eat well?”\n“I thought so.”\nMihali shook his head. “I heard they’d relegated you to quarters and\nwere feeding you soldier’s rations. That qualifies as a war crime in my\nbook.”\n“Ah.” Taniel smiled, but couldn’t be sure that Mihali was actually\njoking. He leaned forward, taking his wineglass, and noted that the wine\nbottle was still full after, what, five glasses between the two of them?\nPerhaps Mihali had a second bottle hidden somewhere.\n“I have a letter for you,” Mihali said, removing an envelope from his\napron.\nTaniel paused, a fork halfway to his mouth. “From?” he mumbled\naround a mouthful of quail’s egg.\n“Colonel Etan.”\nTaniel tossed his fork down and snatched the letter. He tore it open and\nran his eyes over the contents. When he was finished, he pushed his chair\nback and took a deep breath. He wasn’t hungry anymore, not even for\nMihali’s food.\n“What is it?” Mihali asked.\n“None of your…” Taniel swallowed his retort. Mihali had come all this"

        "text": "Mihali’s food.\n“What is it?” Mihali asked.\n“None of your…” Taniel swallowed his retort. Mihali had come all this\nway from the front with a full meal, and delivered a letter that would likely\nnot have reached Taniel otherwise. The chef deserved his thanks, not his\nanger. “I asked Colonel Etan to pull the quartermaster records regarding\nblack-powder use in the army.”\n“Oh?”\n“He also pulled requisition orders. They don’t match up. The army has\nrequisitioned three times as much powder as they’ve used, and nearly twice\nwhat has actually reached the front line.”\n“It’s getting lost somewhere?” Mihali asked.\n“More likely stolen. Corruption’s not unheard of in any army, even ours,\nbut Tamas cracks down on it hard during wartime. These records”—he\ntossed the envelope on his bed—“mean that the quartermasters are in on it.\nAnd at least one member of the General Staff. Someone is making millions\noff this war.”\n“As you said,” Mihali responded, “it’s not unheard of.”\n“But powder… we’ll run out quickly at this rate. The whole country, and\nthen it doesn’t matter how much better our troops are, we’ll be ground\nbeneath Kez’s heel. Damn it!” Taniel drummed his fingers on the silver\nplatter in front of him. He wanted to throw it across the room, but there was\nstill a bit of beef left. “Can you get me out of here?”\n“I’m sorry, but I don’t think so,” Mihali said with a sigh. “As I told you\nbefore, the General Staff doesn’t listen to a word I say.” Mihali patted his\nbelly. “Tamas—now he has an ear for good sense, even if he is mistrustful\nof the person giving it. These generals can’t see past the ends of their\nnoses.”\nTaniel leaned back and sipped his wine. Something about Mihali’s\nsteady tone and unruffled attitude helped calm his nerves. “They’re some of\nthe best in the Nine, believe it or not.” To his surprise, there was no grudge\nin his tone. “Though I can’t say that speaks well for Adro, or against the\nrest of the Nine.”\nMihali chuckled. “That certainly explains why we haven’t lost yet.\nDespite being so heavily outnumbered.”\n“How is it going on the front?” Taniel asked. “I mean, I can see…” He\ngestured out the window, the memory of the wagons full of dead and\nwounded still fresh. “But I’ve had no real news for two days.”\n“Not well. We lost almost a mile yesterday.” Mihali’s face grew serious.\n“You were about to change things, you know. Stopping that advance last\nweek gave the men their first victory in months. They had heart. I could\nsense it. They would have charged after you, right down Kresimir’s throat.”\n“Pit. I have to get out of here. Back on the front. And I need to find out\nwho’s profiteering off our black powder.”\n“How?”\n“I’ll strangle every quartermaster in the army until one tells me. You’re\nsure you can’t get me released?”"

You’re\nsure you can’t get me released?”\n“Most of the General Staff doesn’t even believe I’m a god. To them, I’m\na mad chef. The only way you’ll get out of here, Taniel, is if you apologize\nto Major Doravir.”\nTaniel stood up and went to the window. “Absolutely not.”\n“Don’t pit your pride against General Ket’s,” Mihali said. “That woman\nmakes Brude look humble.”\nBrude. One of the saints—er, gods. Taniel watched Mihali down a fourth\nglass of wine out of the corner of his eye. It was easy to forget what Mihali\nwas. After all, one would expect a god to look, and act, as grand as any\nking. Not dribble wine out of the corner of his mouth and then clean it up\nwith a shirtsleeve.\n“What can I do?” Taniel asked. He wondered if Mihali had given advice\nto his father. He couldn’t imagine Tamas soliciting advice from a chef, even\nif he did believe that Mihali was a god.\n“Apologize to Doravir.”\nTaniel blew air out through his nose.\n“I can’t see much,” Mihali said quietly, looking into his wineglass. “The\nfuture is always moving, always blurry, even to those with the vision to see\nit. What I can see is that if you stay in this room, we’ll continue to lose\nground every day. The Kez will push us out of the valley and surround us,\neventually forcing a surrender. Or we’ll run out of powder, and the same\nwill happen.”\nTaniel scoffed. “I’m just one man. I can’t make that much of a\ndifference.”\n“One man always makes a difference. Sometimes it’s a small one. Other\ntimes, he tips a war. And you… you’re not human. Not anymore.”\n“Oh? Then what am I?” Taniel asked. Mihali made less and less sense as\nhe continued to speak.\n“Hmm,” Mihali said. “I don’t think there’s a word for it. After all,\nyou’re the first of your kind. You’ve become like Julene.”\nTaniel heard his own sharp intake of breath. “I’m not a Predeii.”\n“No. Not precisely. You’re not immortal, after all. Then again, neither is\nJulene. She’s just ageless. I don’t think your sorcery would ever let you\nbecome ageless. Even with Ka-poel’s help. But you’re the powder-mage\nequivalent of a Predeii.”\n“This is ridiculous. Where is Ka-poel?”\n“Hiding. I offered her my protection—with some reservations, of course.\nThat girl makes my skin crawl. She didn’t accept it. I might need her help at\nsome point, though.”\nTaniel rubbed his temples.\n“Another glass of wine?”\n“I think I’ve had enough.”\n“Suit yourself.” Mihali poured himself another one. His cheeks were\nflushed, but other than that there was no sign he’d drunk seven glasses. The\nwine bottle, Taniel noted, was still full."

The\nwine bottle, Taniel noted, was still full.\n“You said that you can see a little of the future,” Taniel said. “If I\napologize to Major Doravir, what then?”\nMihali stared into his wineglass. “Motion. That’s what I see. It’s a small\nevent, but it stirs things up. It makes the certain uncertain. And right now,\nthe certain does not bode well for us.”\nTaniel snatched a quill pen and took the back of Etan’s letter. Quickly,\nink smudging the page, he scrawled out a note. “Can you get this to Ricard\nTumblar?” he asked. “I can’t send it regular post. If someone on the General\nStaff is profiteering, they’ll have eyes everywhere.”\n“I can send one of my girls,” Mihali said, taking the letter.\n“Thank you. Do you know where can I find Major Doravir?”\n“As it happens… yes.”\nCHAPTER\n23\nT\namas watched the sunrise over the Adran Mountains to the east and\nwondered if it would be the last he would ever see.\nThe Kez dragoons had caught up with them late the day before. They\nmade camp over a mile into Hune Dora Forest. He’d spent half the night\nwatching their campfires flicker in the night and listening to them sing\ncavalry battle hymns. Every so often a gunshot would punctuate the distant\nsound as one of their scouts got too close and met a powder mage’s bullet.\nNow, the world was quiet but for the sound of the swift river on the\nrocks behind him. Tamas lay on the ground, leaning against his saddle about\na hundred paces from the river. He held a powder charge in his hand,\nkneading the paper between his fingers.\nIn his mind he could see the dragoons climbing from their tents,\nstretching in the crisp morning air and preparing Fatrastan coffee over their\ncookfires. They’d be unhurried. Restful. They knew that their heavy cavalry\nwouldn’t be here for some time yet, and that Beon wouldn’t attack before\nhe had his full force.\n“Where are the cuirassiers?” Tamas asked. His breath fogged as he\nspoke. Despite the heat of the summer days, the mornings were still chill\nthis close to the mountains.\nGavril stared sullenly toward the tree line as if he expected the dragoons\nto appear any moment. “Not more than a few hours away. I’d expect them\nhere by noon.”\n“They’ll be in formation by two o’clock. One, if Beon’s generals are\norganized.”\n“Not long to get ready.”\n“Long enough. Olem.”\nThe bodyguard stirred from his lookout position a few paces from\nTamas’s side. “Sir?”\n“Pull our pickets back from the forest. Are the rafts done?”\n“Aye, sir. Three big ones.”\n“Begin ferrying troops across the river. Start with the wounded, then the\ngreenest troops. Take your time at it. I expect the Kez to attack between one"

I expect the Kez to attack between one\nand two o’clock. I want about a thousand of our men across the river by\nthen. Enough to be convincing, but not enough to destroy our ability to\nfight.”\n“Very good, sir. Anything else?” Olem’s tone was crisp. Ready for\nbattle.\n“Does everyone know where they are meant to be when the fighting\nstarts?”\n“Yes, sir. We drilled them half the night.”\n“Make things chaotic. I want lots of milling about. Fistfights. If you\nhave to ‘lose’ one of the rafts in the river, so be it. This has to be\nconvincing.”\n“I spoke to Colonel Arbor last night, sir. His men are going to hide their\nkits and rifles. Make like they’ve abandoned them.”\n“Good. Dismissed. Wait. Find me Andriya and Vlora.”\nOlem flinched at the mention of Vlora’s name. He saluted and was off.\nThe wind was blowing westerly, and Tamas could see a low cloud cover\ninching its way off the Adran Mountains. If rain was coming, it would make\nthis a miserable fight. Beon might even delay his attack, making all of\nTamas’s preparations be for nothing.\nHe wondered idly if Mihali had heard his prayer last night.\n“What are you up to, Tamas?” Gavril asked.\n“Kind of obvious from this end, isn’t it?”\n“I’ve been ranging since you arrived yesterday. To me, it looks like a\nhalf-finished defense.”\n“Perfect.” Tamas climbed to his feet. The camp was shaped in a square.\nTo the north, the Big Finger raged along its banks. To the east, a scree slope\nleading up to the mountain prevented a flanking maneuver by Kez cavalry.\nTo the west and south, a mound of earth about three feet tall had been piled\nall around the camp. It was a standard short defense, from behind which\ninfantry could take easy cover.\nIt would barely slow a cavalry charge.\nTo the west, the mound had been topped with tree trunks, propped\ntogether to form giant Xs. Between them, sharpened stakes had been driven\ninto the ground. It was a thick, deadly defense against cavalry. A few\nhundred men worked hard at adding to those stakes as the mound of dirt\nswung around to defend the south. It wasn’t nearly enough men. There\nwould be a gap in their defenses about an eighth of a mile long. A gap\nthrough which ten thousand dragoons would charge.\n“Sir.”\nTamas broke away from his examination of the camp. Andriya and\nVlora stood at attention. Neither looked like they’d slept all night. Damned\nfools.\n“Gather the powder mages,” Tamas said. “I’m sending you across the\nriver.”\nThey stared back at him blankly. “Sir?” Andriya said. His hands\ntwitched on his rifle. “You promised we’d be killing Kez.”\n“You can do that from the other side of the river. I’m not risking any of\nmy mages in the melee. I want you where you can shoot without being shot"

I want you where you can shoot without being shot\n—or stabbed.”\n“You want us to cross in shifts to keep the Kez scouts at bay?” Vlora\nasked.\nTamas hesitated. A chill wind cut through the camp and he noticed a low\nfog creeping its way down from the mountains and across the floodplain.\n“No. I want the Kez scouts getting a good look at the camp now. They’re\nwelcome to get as close as they dare.”\n“Sir, I’d rather be on this side of the river,” Andriya said.\nTamas sighed. “Not today, Andriya.”\nAndriya gripped his rifle. “Please, sir.” He bared his teeth. “You\npromised I would get to kill Kez.”\n“From a distance.” Tamas clipped the words off firmly. “Besides, they’ll\nbe watching for the Marked. They’ll feel more confident with you on the\nother side of the river.”\n“You’re coming with us, then?” Vlora said.\nTamas frowned. “No. Why would I?”\n“You’re one of the powder mages, sir.”\n“No. I have to remain in close in order to command.”\n“That’s not fair.” Andriya was livid. He stared toward the forest,\nstraining like a hound that could smell its quarry. “I’ve got every right to\nput my bayonet through a Kez noble’s eye. I want blood on my hands.”\n“ ‘Blood on my hands, sir,’ ” Tamas corrected. He didn’t need this. He\nhad fifteen thousand cavalry about to rain down on him, and just when he\nthought he might have sorted things out with Vlora, Andriya was becoming\ninsubordinate. “Cross the river. That’s an order, soldier.”\nHe turned away from Andriya to make it clear that the conversation was\nover. The two powder mages left him alone with Gavril. Tamas and Gavril\nremained silent for a few minutes, watching the organized chaos evolve in\nthe camp. Men shouted. Tamas thought he saw a punch thrown. A little\nwhile later, the first raft was launched. It got away from the handlers and\nwas pulled downstream with no one on it. A cry of dismay went up from the\nbrigades, and Tamas didn’t think it was feigned.\n“Where do you want me?” Gavril asked.\n“On your horse,” Tamas said. “You and your rangers should take the\neastern flank, in case some of Beon’s dragoons attempt the scree.”\n“All right,” Gavril said.\n“Here.” Tamas unhooked the cavalry saber from his belt and handed it to\nGavril. “Better to swing from horseback.”\n“You’re not going to be mounted?”\nTamas smiled, though he didn’t feel any mirth behind it. “I’m taking the\ncenter. If I’m not mounted, the men won’t see when I fall.”\nGavril seemed to think on the gravity behind those words before\naccepting the cavalry saber.\nTamas took the small sword from his saddle and hooked it to his belt.\n“I’ll see you after the battle,” Gavril said."

Gavril held him for a moment, then headed off to join his rangers.\nOlem returned an hour later.\n“Any of the men eat this morning?” Tamas asked.\n“Caught a lot of fish in the river, actually. Andriya bagged a pair of\ngoats on the mountainside. There was a little leftover horse. Every man had\na bite of something.”\n“Let’s hope it’s enough,” Tamas said.\nOlem looked up. “At least the buzzards will eat well.”\nTamas watched as the fog he’d seen earlier moving in slowly enveloped\nthe entire camp. It wasn’t thick—barely two feet deep. Enough to obscure\nthe ground but not the camp itself. The clouds had moved in from above.\nThey threatened rain, but Tamas had seen this kind of weather before.\nThere’d be nothing more than a light mist.\nStrange weather for a summer day.\nAt eleven thirty, Tamas caught sight of a pair of horsemen to the west,\nnearly a mile away at the bend in the river. He sprinkled some black powder\non his tongue, and the men came into sharp relief. Tan-and-green uniforms\nunder shining breastplates, and wearing plumed helmets.\nThe cuirassiers had arrived.\nAdamat stood on the sixth floor of the Dwightwich bell tower with a\nlooking glass at his eye. He was examining a fellow with shifty eyes who\nwas wearing a faded red waistcoat and knee-length trousers and sitting on\nthe stoop about a hundred paces from Lord Vetas’s headquarters.\n“They have another lookout on the corner of Seventh and Mayflew\nAvenue,” Adamat said. He could hear the scratching of a pen behind him.\nHe scanned the streets once more with the looking glass and then handed it\nto a young woman by the name of Riplas—the eunuch’s second-in-\ncommand. She took his spot at the window while he turned to the\nassembled group in the cramped bell tower room.\n“You’re sure you have everyone?” the eunuch asked Adamat.\nAdamat looked at the eunuch out of the corner of his eye. If he had any\nidea Adamat was blackmailing his master, he’d given no indication when he\nshowed up the day before with forty of the meanest street scum Adamat had\never seen: boxers, gang members, dockworkers, pimps, and bodyguards.\n“I’ve been watching them on and off for almost two weeks,” Adamat\nsaid. “They change their posts, but between your reports and mine I think\nwe have everyone.”\nHe guessed that Vetas was employing over a hundred heads, based on\nthe comings and goings from his headquarters. That was no small operation,\nand any thirty of them could be in the headquarters at any given time. The\nProprietor had said Vetas had sixty enforcers.\nAdamat looked over at Bo. The Privileged was down on his haunches in\none corner of the room, his eyes closed, hands folded inside the sleeves of\nhis jacket. He opened his eyes, as if he’d felt Adamat’s gaze upon him."

He was still unnerved by the casual murder of\nManhouch’s headsman the day before.\n“Vetas’s pet Privileged is there,” Bo said. “Right now. She’s not some\nhired fool, either. She’s got cabal-level stuff at her beck and call.”\nA bird burst from the bells above their heads, causing Adamat to jump.\nHe noticed that he was the only one to do so and smoothed the front of his\ncoat. A powerful Privileged? That wasn’t good. Not at all. He was\ndepending on Bo to be able to neutralize Vetas’s Privileged even as\nAdamat’s men seized the place.\nBo must have sensed the unasked question. “I’ll kill her. Don’t worry\nabout that.”\n“If it turns into any kind of a fight between you two, we’re all dead\nmen,” the eunuch said.\n“Well, you’re not exactly a man,” Bo said with a smirk. He nodded to\nRiplas. “And she’s not.” His smirk suddenly turned to a frown. “And she’s\ndefinitely not.”\nAdamat turned to see Fell standing on the bell tower stairs. The Fontain\nAcademy graduate wore a fitted waistcoat, sans tails, and a pair of tight\nmen’s pants tucked into her boots.\n“Ricard can’t spare any men right now,” Fell said, “but he sent me.”\nThe eunuch turned toward her with a look of disgust. “Does he know the\nresources the Proprietor is shifting for this operation?” he asked.\n“As a matter of fact,” Fell said, cocking her eyebrow, “he doesn’t. I’m\nsure he’ll be interested to know.”\nAdamat stepped between them. “It’s more help than you realize,” he said\nto the eunuch. For Ricard to send his ten-million-krana servant into harm’s\nway meant a great deal.\n“Bah,” the eunuch sneered. His fingers tapped rapidly against the side of\nhis leg. He seemed on edge—not the quiet, thoughtful killer Adamat had\nmet months ago.\nAdamat stepped back to the window and took the looking glass from\nRiplas. “Any more lookouts?” he asked.\n“None.”\n“Then take the final assignments down.”\nRiplas left the room. She had the positions and descriptions of all of\nLord Vetas’s lookouts. She’d hand them over to the eunuch’s goons, and\nthey’d do the rest.\nEverything was in place. Now Adamat just had to wait.\nHe lifted the looking glass to his eye and returned his gaze to Vetas’s\nheadquarters. Over an hour passed, and he watched from his vantage point\nas the eunuch’s goons took care of Vetas’s lookouts. He felt the sweat roll\ndown the back of his neck as he waited. So much could go wrong. The\nslightest slip, and Faye was dead.\n“What if he doesn’t come outside today?” Bo asked.\nThe front door to Vetas’s headquarters opened, and a familiar figure\nstepped outside.

He wore his sharp black coat, top hat, and carried a cane in\none hand. Adamat felt his heart jump at the sight.\n“That’s not going to be a problem,” Adamat said. “He’s leaving now.”\nLord Vetas checked the street with the smallest twitches of his head.\nProbably receiving signals from his lookouts—the closest of whom Adamat\nhad left undisturbed.\nVetas gave an almost imperceptible nod. A woman came through the\ndoor—the same one he’d seen in the red dress weeks ago, with the auburn\ncurls—and together they headed south down the avenue. They were\nfollowed two steps back by a pair of well-dressed and well-muscled men. A\nfew seconds later a third came out the door, waited for a moment, then\nfollowed.\n“I’ll keep on his trail,” Fell said, disappearing down the stairs.\n“Take his tail,” Adamat said to the eunuch, “and then meet us at the\nhouse. Bo?”\nBo stood up, stretching his gloved fingers. “I’ll get a little closer and\nunravel the Privileged’s wards. It’ll take me some time, but I’ll be ready\nwhen you get back.”\nSergeant Oldrich was waiting for Adamat in the chapel beneath the bell\ntower. He sat in a pew, legs up, a wad of tobacco in one cheek. He tipped\nhis hat back, watching as Bo slid out one exit.\n“So,” Oldrich said, turning to Adamat, “you got yourself a Privileged.”\nAdamat steeled himself. He couldn’t be sure how Oldrich would react\nafter having specifically stated he wouldn’t help Adamat rescue Bo. “I did.”\n“I heard Verundish dismissed her men and left town yesterday. I thought\nthat might have been the cause.”\n“I did what I needed to. He’s freed of his gaes, if that makes a\ndifference.”\n“Oh?”\n“He killed the guillotine operator who took off Manhouch’s head.”\n“Huh,” Oldrich said. “Well, I’m sure the field marshal will be delighted.\nYou ready?”\n“Let’s go.”\nOldrich’s soldiers fell in with them as they left the chapel, and Adamat\ntold them to stay back a hundred paces.\nAdamat, in turn, trailed Fell. He saw her weaving in and out of foot\ntraffic as they headed farther into the city. The streets were crowded just\nafter lunch—that would make it harder for Vetas’s men to spot Adamat, but\njust as hard for Adamat to keep track of them.\nIt was a little over thirty minutes before Fell stopped and waved Adamat\nforward. They stood at a busy intersection, just around the corner from a\nflower market. Fell had her back against the wall, her shoulders slumped as\nif she didn’t have a care in the world. Adamat came up beside her and\nmimicked her body language.\n“His tail is over there,” she said, slowly tilting her chin upward in one\ndirection.\nAdamat saw the man right away. He was eating a meat pie and scanning\nthe crowd with a mistrusting leer. Not subtle, but an effective lookout. Not\nfar behind him, Adamat spotted the eunuch."

Not\nfar behind him, Adamat spotted the eunuch.\n“Vetas is inside the flower stall around the corner,” Fell said. “Leave\nhim to me. Have your soldiers take his goons.”\n“I want him alive.”\n“So do I,” Fell said.\nAdamat needed him alive so Vetas could tell him where Josep was. He\nwondered why Fell would want him breathing.\n“I’m going,” Fell said. She disappeared around the corner, casual and\ngraceful as a cat.\nAdamat gave the signal to Oldrich, then tilted his hat forward to hide his\nface and followed Fell.\nHe made his way to the middle of the street and was soon joined by\nOldrich and six of his men. They each examined bouquets or pretended to\ntalk, but he couldn’t help but think they looked far too obvious.\nVetas’s two goons were standing outside of the Parkside Flower\nBoutique, watching the crowd, their arms crossed, not the least bit subtle.\nAdamat glanced toward the tail. The man was gone. Adamat hoped that\nmeant the eunuch had taken care of him.\nAdamat could feel every muscle tighten as he watched the flower shop\nentrance out of the corner of his eye. Maybe Vetas had already spotted them\nand disappeared out the side. What if his goons warned him, or Vetas was\nable to slip into the crowd?\nHis hands were beginning to shake from nervousness when Lord Vetas\nfinally emerged from the flower shop with the woman in the red dress. She\ncarried a bouquet of flowers. He handed a package to one of his goons and\nscanned the flower market.\nHis eyes locked onto Adamat’s. Adamat felt a cold sweat break at the\ncorner of his brow. He tensed, ready to chase Vetas through the streets.\nFell emerged from the flower shop, strolling out like a paying customer.\nA stiletto dropped from her sleeve and she gracefully swung it around over\nVetas’s shoulder and pressed it to his throat.\nThe two goons stepped back, shouting. Both drew pistols. The crowd\nsplit apart.\nAdamat felt like he was in a dream. He watched himself draw his own\npistol and fire it. One of the goons went down. The other took a cudgel to\nthe back of the head from one of Oldrich’s soldiers, and the rest of the\nsoldiers quickly fell in around Vetas, obscuring him from the crowd.\nAdamat shouldered his way through the soldiers until he reached Vetas.\nLord Vetas was on his knees in front of Fell, a stiletto still to his throat.\nShe’d relieved him of two very similar-looking daggers and a small pistol,\nboth of which were lying on the ground behind her.\nAdamat took great pleasure in the mild look of surprise on Vetas’s face.\nIt died quickly when Vetas saw Adamat.\nVetas smiled. “Adamat! I suspected you might still be alive.”\n“Is she still alive?” Adamat pressed the hot barrel of his pistol against\nVetas’s face.\n“Every pain you do to me,” Vetas said, not flinching at the heat of the"

I want you to\nremember that, Adamat.”\n“So she is alive?”\n“Quite,” Vetas said. “Though she won’t be in an hour and forty-two\nminutes if I haven’t returned.” He paused, looking around at the soldiers. “I\nsuspect you know where my headquarters is. You’ve probably been\nwatching me very closely. Bravo. But do you have enough men to get in\nthere?”\n“You mean past your Privileged?” Adamat asked. “Yes. Yes, I think I do.\nWhere is my boy?”\nVetas gave a sickeningly self-satisfied smile. “An hour and forty-one\nminutes. Are you sure you have time for this?”\nAdamat looked at the woman in the red dress. Oldrich held her tightly\nby the arm. She glared at him through narrowed eyes, but he could see that\nher hands trembled. “Who are you?” he demanded.\n“Nila,” she said.\n“What do you do for him?” He pointed at Vetas.\n“Nothing! I… nothing. I don’t work for him. I’m just there to watch\nJakob. He’s only a boy!”\n“What was Vetas buying in there?”\n“Flowers!”\n“For who?”\n“Lady Windeldwas, or something like that.” Nila brushed the hair out of\nher face.\n“Lady Winceslav?”\n“Yes, that was it.”\n“Why?”\n“I don’t know.” For all her fright, she was remarkably calm beneath the\ntorrent of questions.\nAdamat turned back to Vetas. “Why?”\n“An hour and forty minutes, Adamat,” he said.\nAdamat brought his pistol back and slammed the butt across Vetas’s\nface. “Secure them,” he said to Fell. To Oldrich, “Sergeant, give her four of\nyour men. We need to get off the street before the police get here.”\nFell dragged Vetas to his feet, still holding the stiletto to his throat.\nOldrich sent four of the men with her, along with Nila and the two wounded\ngoons, and the rest of the soldiers followed Adamat.\nThey met up with the eunuch three blocks down from Vetas’s\nheadquarters.\n“My men are in position,” the eunuch said.\n“Where’s Bo?” Adamat asked, wheezing from the effort of the run.\nHe found the Privileged around the corner, standing in the middle of the\nstreet. Bo wore black gloves over his Privileged gloves to conceal them. He\nwas muttering to himself, his gloved fingers working silently in the air in\nfront of him, as if he was playing an invisible piano with one hand and\nplucking a harp with the other. There were three or four people watching\nhim as if he was some kind of madman. He certainly looked the part.\n“We have to go in now,” Adamat said. He hunched over his pistol, trying\nto conceal it from view while he reloaded it.\nBo’s fingers continued to work the air. “I said I’d need time.”"

He hunched over his pistol, trying\nto conceal it from view while he reloaded it.\nBo’s fingers continued to work the air. “I said I’d need time.”\n“We don’t have much time,” Adamat said. “His men have orders to kill\nFaye if he doesn’t return at a prescribed time.”\n“Unfortunate,” Bo said with a scowl. “Tell the eunuch to get his men in\nplace.”\nThe order was given, and five minutes later the eunuch joined Adamat\nand Bo.\n“We’re ready,” the eunuch said.\nBo looked him up and down, eyes lingering on the tailored suit and the\nbald head. “You make my skin crawl.”\n“I’ll take that as a compliment.”\nAdamat smoothed the front of his jacket. “Sergeant?”\nOldrich’s remaining soldiers had fetched their rifles. They were\nbeginning to get looks from the passersby. “We’re ready,” Oldrich said.\n“Let’s make it a parade, then.” Bo turned on his heel and marched down\nthe middle of the street, heading toward Lord Vetas’s headquarters. His\nfingers twitched, making music that only he could hear. Adamat exchanged\na look with Captain Oldrich. This was not how they’d taken the house in\nOffendale.\nBo didn’t slow as he rounded the corner and stepped his way toward\nVetas’s house. When he reached the middle of the street directly in front of\nthe house, he turned and faced it. He raised his hands above his head. In one\nof the windows, a lookout shouted a warning.\nEven though Adamat couldn’t open his third eye, he could still feel it\nwhen a Privileged standing at his elbow reached into the Else. Sorcery\nflowed into the world, and Bo threw his arms wide, and the entire face of\nthe building collapsed like a piece of cake sliced by a giant knife.\nAdamat stared at the dust rising from the rubble. Men inside the house\nstared back, coughing and waving away plaster dust. The shock was plain\non their faces.\nSergeant Oldrich drew his sword. “Charge!” he screamed.\nAll pit broke loose.\nCHAPTER\n24\nA\ncolumn of heavy cavalry appeared on the floodplain downriver, west of\nTamas. The plumes on their helmets waved gently in the breeze, their\nmounts stepping with confidence despite the low cover of fog.\nTamas lifted his looking glass and examined the enemy.\nThe officers were out front with their red epaulets, shouting orders,\nsabers raised.\nFools.\nA rifle cracked from somewhere across the river. A few moments later a\nKez officer tumbled from his horse.\nThey advanced at a leisurely pace, as if it were nothing more than a\nparade drill. More rifle shots rang out from Tamas’s powder mages, and\ncuirassiers began to fall. The column continued to advance.\n“This weather might foul our powder, sir,” Olem said, looking up at the\nclouds.\nTamas said, “It won’t rain.”\n“It’s awfully damp, sir. Strange, this fog.

There was movement among the trees half a mile away across the\nfloodplain where only hours ago Tamas’s infantry had been cutting trees\nand dragging them to camp.\nThe dragoons emerged from the forest.\nTamas felt his breath catch in his throat. So many cavalry in one place.\nHe’d seen a force like this perhaps three times in his life. Each time,\nhe’d been numbered among those cavalry, and the enemy had been swept\nbefore them. The horses stepped in line, well trained and fearless. Unlike\nthe cuirassiers, someone among the dragoons had the foresight to remove\nthe officer’s epaulets, so they would be harder to pick out for Tamas’s\npowder mages.\nBehind him, the panic among the Seventh and Ninth Brigades seemed to\nrise in pitch, and Tamas worried that the act had outgrown itself. He’d\nwitnessed hard infantry of the line break at the sight of a magnificent\ncavalry formation before.\nAnd the Kez cavalry were magnificent. The armored breasts of the\ncuirassier warhorses seemed to form a wall of moving steel. Their plumes\nquivered with the movement, and the immaculate uniforms of their riders\nonly added to their majesty.\nTamas searched the line of cuirassiers. In a powder trance, he could see\nthe faces of each man, even at this distance. But picking out one face among\nso many was nearly impossible. “I wonder where Beon will position\nhimself,” Tamas said. He pointed with his small sword to the southwest.\n“There, likely, so that he can sweep with his cuirassiers around the barriers\nwe’ve set up and join his dragoons in the slaughter.” Tamas turned to his\nbodyguard. “Tell me we’re going to win, Olem.”\n“ ‘We’re going to win, Olem,’ ” Olem said, putting his last cigarette in\nhis mouth.\nTamas stepped onto a rocky outcropping to give himself a better view of\nthe battlefield.\n“Men,” he shouted, “take the line!”\nNila was pushed into a doorway by one of the soldiers.\nShe squeezed her eyes closed, fighting tears she knew so desperately\nwanted to come. To have escaped soldiers so many times and then fall into\nLord Vetas’s clutches, and now this? Who were these people? What did\nthey want?\nA man grabbed her by the arm and shoved her up a narrow flight of\nstairs. They went up two floors, shouting and cursing the whole way. Nila\nfought them out of instinct more than anything else. She clawed at a\nsoldier’s face, only for her arm to be bent around behind her and her face\nshoved up against the wall.\n“Pit, this girl is a hellion,” the man said. She tried to twist in his grip. He\nput pressure on her arm and she gasped from the sudden pain. It felt as if it\nwould snap at any moment.\nShe was thrown into the corner of a small, windowless room.

The plaster\nwas yellow and bare, the only furniture a squat table with a stub of candle.\nThey hadn’t gone far before finding this building, not more than a\ncouple of blocks. Nila had no idea if this was planned, but there seemed\nsome confusion among the soldiers.\nLord Vetas was pushed to the ground beside her. She stared at him—the\nonly familiar face in this chaos. He was calm, collected. Completely\nunperturbed. Nila hated that she looked to him for some kind of\nreassurance. She knew none would come.\n“Watch him,” the woman said. She was young, and could not have been\nmore than ten years older than Nila, but her eyes were as cold as Vetas’s.\nNila had heard someone call her Fell. The soldiers seemed hesitant to\nfollow her orders, but after Fell gave them a long stare, they turned to watch\nVetas.\nFell had drawn a pair of wrist irons from beneath her coat. They weren’t\ntypical irons, even Nila could see that. Instead of a horseshoe-looking metal\nwith a crosspiece, they were thick bands with only a single loop of chain\nbetween them. The two soldiers turned Vetas roughly onto his stomach, and\nthe irons were snapped around his wrists. He rolled over, examining Fell.\n“Drovian irons,” he said. “Very professional.”\n“Turn around,” Fell said to Nila.\n“No,” Nila said.\nFell grasped her by the arm and jerked her forward onto her knees. Fell\nstepped behind her, and Nila felt the cold metal of the wrist irons close on\nher skin.\nThere was a shout from downstairs. Fell turned to one of the soldiers.\n“Do not take your eyes off of him,” she said, and disappeared down the\nstairs.\nDespite Fell’s instructions, the two soldiers retreated to the hallway,\nwhere they stood near the door, leaning on their rifles.\n“What is happening?” Nila asked Vetas.\nVetas’s face was impassive, unmoving as always. He didn’t so much as\nglance at her.\nHe watched the two soldiers for a moment before rocking back on his\nhips and deftly sliding his shackled wrists beneath his legs and out in front\nof him, like a contortionist performing a trick. Nila felt her eyes widen a bit.\nThe wrist irons hurt like all pit, and even if they hadn’t been so tight, she\ncouldn’t have done that—and Vetas was a man well over forty.\nNila glanced nervously between Vetas and the soldiers. How could they\nnot see him? Did they just not care?\nVetas pulled something off the bottom of his shoe: a wooden knob. It\nlooked like the handle of an ice pick Nila had seen men use to move blocks\nof ice in the winter, but it had no pick attached to it.\nAnother handle came off the bottom of his other shoe, and Vetas\nsearched through his slicked hair with his fingers, drawing out a long wire\nafter only a moment of searching. He wrapped the wire around one handle\nand then the other.\nNila had been with Lord Vetas long enough to know what it was: a\ngarrote.\nVetas got to his feet in one smooth motion, like a snake rising from the"

He crossed the room in a few silent steps.\nOne of the soldiers must have seen him coming out of the corner of his\neye. The soldier whirled, raising his rifle. Vetas slammed an elbow into the\nsoldier’s throat. The soldier staggered to one side, gurgling painfully for air.\nThe other soldier had his rifle up in time, but the long bayonet was\nimpossible to use in such close quarters. Vetas grabbed the stock of the rifle\nand smacked the soldier in the nose with it. When the man reeled back,\nVetas slid around him, dropping the garrote into place.\nNila’s mind whirled. She eyed the soldier’s fallen rifle—she could have\nused it on Vetas if not for the irons locking her hands behind her back. The\ntwo soldiers soon lay dead in the hall. Blood trickled across the floorboards,\nflowing to fill the grooves.\nVetas, his face still and unmoving as stone, searched the soldier for keys.\nThe creaking of the floorboards was the only warning. Vetas looked up\nand suddenly fell back into the hallway, out of Nila’s line of sight. Fell\nsoared past, knife at the ready.\nNila could hear the dull thumps of flesh on flesh. Grunts, a few quiet\ncurses—those came from the woman.\nThe pair tumbled back into the room. Nila screamed as both of them\ntumbled over her outstretched feet.\nThey struggled on the floor, legs intertwined, the knife pressed flat\nbetween them. Nila kicked indiscriminately. She wanted them away from\nher. The knives, the anger—one slip, and Nila could be dead.\nFell rolled off of Vetas and sprang to her feet.\nShe struck at him, fast as a viper. Vetas, still on his knees, caught the\nknife on the metal of his wrist irons. She struck again, and again, and each\ntime Vetas moved impossibly fast to block her. Between the strikes he\nmanaged to regain his footing.\nThey circled warily, and Nila pulled herself into the corner as much as\npossible.\nShe hoped they’d kill each other. But what then? She had no way of\ngetting the irons off her hands.\nFell and Vetas seemed at an impasse. Their circling stopped. Fell\nchanged hands with her dagger, then changed back.\nNila didn’t hesitate. Months of anger and fear came to a head, and with a\nshriek of rage she kicked Vetas in the back of the leg.\nFell struck out at Lord Vetas at the same time. The blow to Vetas’s leg\nsent him leaning backward. The knife slid past his eye, cutting one cheek\nbadly. He caught Fell’s hand, deftly sliding the garrote around her wrist, and\nswung about.\nFell had no choice but to follow his swing, or risk losing her hand. Vetas\nstepped close to her, and she tried to step away. It was like some kind of\ngrisly dance.\nVetas slammed his head forward into Fell’s cheek. The woman staggered\nbackward, hitting the window."

The woman staggered\nbackward, hitting the window.\nVetas had let go of his garrote. Dazed, Fell couldn’t have seen the kick\ncoming. She took a boot square to the chest, and tumbled out the window.\nVetas turned to Nila. There was a quiet click, and his wrist irons fell off.\nHe held the key up in one hand.\nNila shrank away from the darkness in his eyes.\n“You bet the wrong way, laundress,” he said. He tossed the key on the\nfloor. “You’ll pay for that tonight. I promise. If not you, then the boy will.”\nHe left the room, leaving Nila to let the sobs wrench themselves from\nher throat. Her whole body shook. She crawled over to the key. It took a\nfew minutes with her trembling hands to get it into the lock and free herself.\nShe stared at the destruction. Two dead soldiers, a broken window, and\nLord Vetas was gone. She took the time to collect herself. Deep breaths\nstopped the sobs, and she dried her tears. This wasn’t the time to give in to\nemotion.\nShe could run. She knew that.\nBut if she ran, Vetas would do unspeakable things to Jakob. It was no\nempty threat. He wouldn’t hesitate.\nNila crept down the stairs, only to find the other two soldiers dead in the\nhallway on the first floor. One’s head was twisted at an impossible angle.\nThe other had been bayoneted with his own rifle.\nThere was a crowd gathering in the street looking at the bodies through\nthe open door. A woman was screaming for the police. Someone pointed at\nNila.\nIt only took a moment to find a back door to the building. Nila took it,\nslipping down an alleyway and into the crowd.\nShe had to make her way back to Vetas’s house and try to get Jakob\naway.\nAdamat put his head down and charged into the gaping hole left in Vetas’s\nheadquarters by Bo’s sorcery.\nHe shot the first man to raise a weapon, and then tossed aside his spent\npistol and drew his cane sword.\nOldrich’s soldiers were the first to follow Adamat into the fray, their\nbayonets making short work of Vetas’s goons. The eunuch’s men followed\nthem in, and Adamat could hear pistol shots and the sounds of fighting from\nthe other side of the buildings. They’d formed a cordon around Vetas’s\nheadquarters. Now they just had to tighten it.\nA horizontal pillar of flame shot through the wall of one of the rooms\ninside, missing Adamat by not more than a few feet, the heat of it sending\nhim reeling to one side.\nThe flame splashed over one of the eunuch’s men, sending him\nscreaming, running into the street. The pillar grew longer by the second,\nextending into the street and completely enveloping Privileged Borbador.\nAdamat felt his heart leap into his throat.

Bo advanced, his hands held out in front of him,\nfingers plucking at invisible strings.\nWind tore at Adamat’s coat and buffeted through the innards of the\nbuilding, knocking men from both sides off their feet before slamming\nthrough the wall and pushing back the pillar of flame. Bo raised his hands\nabove his head and was suddenly running forward, his jaw locked and\ndetermined.\nLightning shot at Bo. He batted it aside with one hand as he scaled the\nrubble into the building, then leapt through the inner wall with a roar.\nThe house shuddered and shook as the two Privileged locked in battle.\nAdamat stopped in his tracks as he realized they could all be killed by the\nslightest mistake by either of the Privileged. One finger twitched the wrong\nway, one hand pushed aside accidentally, and every one of them would be\ndead.\nThe Privileged’s flames had lit curtains on one side of the house. The\nfire spread to the table, quickly, and black smoke filled the ruined building.\nHe had to find Faye.\nA man with a scar cutting across his lips stumbled toward Adamat, half\nblinded by the smoke. He swung a small sword wildly, crashing into a chair.\nAdamat leapt back, blocking a second swing with his cane sword, then a\nthird. He felt the handle of his cane shift beneath his fingers—it was not\nmeant to block the flailing sword of a man this big, and would splinter from\nthe shock.\nHe leapt inside the scarred man’s guard and drove the cane sword\nbetween his ribs. The man lurched back, bellowing in pain, and Adamat let\nhim go.\n“Faye!” he yelled. “Faye!”\nThe smoke was getting thicker. Where would Vetas have kept her? The\nbasement? Did he have other prisoners here? The boy had been on the\nsecond floor when Adamat saw him in the window weeks ago, but the boy\nwas not his concern.\nAdamat heard a woman’s scream. It was coming from upstairs.\nThe building was being quickly abandoned. Men ran past Adamat, some\nof them fighting the flames, some of them fighting each other. Adamat\nblinked through the tears brought on by the smoke. There, the staircase.\nHe made his way to the stairs. The house creaked. The flames were\nmoving quickly now, spreading across the furniture at alarming speeds.\nThere was paper everywhere, even in the foyer. Parchments and books,\ntables against all the walls. It looked more like a clerk’s office than a place\nwhere Lord Vetas planned whatever campaign he was waging.\nWhat if he wasn’t keeping Faye here? What if she was somewhere else\nand the scream Adamat had heard was another?\nSmoke filled the staircase as Adamat made his way up it. He pulled a\nhandkerchief from his pocket, pressing it over his face. He stood dismayed\nat the top of the stairs, staring down a long hallway and a row of at least a\ndozen doors.

A small room\nwith two soiled beds and a nightstand. Empty.\nHe drew his foot back to kick open the next door when a scream came\nfrom farther down the hall. He rushed toward the source of the sound. One\nof the doors was open. He swung around the corner, cane sword raised.\nFaye stood over the body of a man, a bloody candlestick in one hand. On\nher face she wore a look so vicious that Adamat scarcely recognized her.\nAdamat saw the face of a small boy peeking out from behind a curtain on\nthe other side of the room.\n“Faye!”\nShe looked up and nearly collapsed when she saw him. She dropped the\ncandlestick and might have fallen had Adamat not caught her.\nThey stared at each other for one long moment, and Adamat wondered if\nit was perhaps she who was supporting him and not the other way around,\nas his knees felt like so much jelly.\n“Where’s Josep?” Adamat asked.\n“Gone. They took him.”\n“I’ll get him back,” Adamat said. He looked at the boy. “That’s the\nEldaminse child, isn’t it?”\n“It is,” Faye said. “Come on.” She held out a hand to the boy. “Don’t be\nafraid, this is my husband.”\nAdamat stared at his wife. “I…” he said.\n“Shh.” She pressed a finger to his lips. There were tears in her eyes. “We\nhave to go.”\nAdamat nodded. “Quickly, let’s—” He stopped in the hallway. The\nsmoke was too thick, and there were flames leaping from the staircase. He\ntore off his jacket. “Press this to your face,” he said to Faye, and gave his\nhandkerchief to the boy. He led them away from the stairs, down the\nhallway and toward the front of the building. They might have to jump to\nthe rubble below, but a broken leg was much preferable to being roasted\nalive.\nAdamat froze as a great groaning noise rose above the sound of the\nflames. Was it the house creaking under the strain of the battle or some kind\nof sorcery?\n“This way,” Faye said, pulling him back into action. She led him around\nthe corner, where another staircase went down to the first floor. There were\nno flames shooting up this one, but he took it cautiously.\nSomething slammed through the staircase wall and tumbled down the\nstairs into a pile of smoldering clothes. Adamat thrust Faye behind him,\npointing at the pile with his sword.\nCoughing, sputtering, it stood up.\nIt was Bo. Flames still licked at his clothes, and his muttonchops were\nsinged.

A whump split the air, making Adamat’s\nears pop. The flames died instantly. Bo’s fingers jerked to one side, and\nwind whipped through the house, sucking smoke away like a giant bellows\ninhaling above a fire.\nThe staircase was suddenly full of cool, clean air. Adamat gasped in a\ngreat breath of it, holding Faye tightly. She clutched the Eldaminse boy to\nher skirts.\nFire whipped past Bo, over his shoulder. The Privileged turned his head,\nas if mildly perturbed. Slivers of ice the size of daggers shot from above his\nhead and thwapped into something out of Adamat’s sight. Bo nodded to\nhimself.\n“You can come down now,” Bo said. “I think it’s safe.”\n“You think?” Adamat crept slowly down the stairs until he reached the\nbase.\nThey passed the kitchen and entered the sitting room at the back of the\nhouse. On the near wall, impaled to the masonry by icicles dripping blood,\nwas the other Privileged. It was a woman, Deliv by her dark skin. Bo didn’t\nspare her a second glance. Faye shielded the Eldaminse boy’s eyes.\n“Faye,” Adamat said, “this is Privileged Borbador, the last remaining\nmember of the Adran royal cabal.”\n“Forgive me if I don’t shake your hand,” Faye said. “I don’t think I want\nto touch your hands.”\nBo’s black gloves had been burned off by the flames, but his rune-\ncovered Privileged’s gloves were white and pristine, as if brand-new. He\nclasped his hands and rocked back on his heels. “Understandable. Where’s\nVetas?” he asked.\n“Fell has him,” Adamat said.\n“That woman, I’d very much like to meet her. Properly, that is.”\nAdamat couldn’t help but wonder what that meant. “I don’t think you\ndo,” he said.\n“I think I’ll be—”\nA scream from outside cut off Bo’s sentence. He cocked his head, like a\ndog listening for a whistle. “Oh, pit,” he said. “You didn’t tell me there were\ntwo.”\n“What, another Privileged?” Adamat began casting around for\nsomewhere to hide. But what could protect them? There was no hiding from\na Privileged.\nBo sneered, rolling up his sleeves. “Yes,” he said. “Get down!”\nThe world exploded in a blast of plaster and wood. Adamat was thrown\nfrom his feet and knocked about, buffeted by forces beyond his control. He\ntried to grab for Faye—for anything, but found himself on the ground a\nmoment later.\nEverything was silent. Had the attack killed Faye? Or Bo, for that\nmatter? Adamat moved cautiously, not sure whether all the parts of him\nwere intact. A beam had fallen across his chest, the air swirling with smoke\nand dust.

It looked like she’d injured her ankle.\nThey were both covered in plaster dust.\nAdamat eyed the eunuch. They’d done it. Taken Vetas. Saved Faye.\nWould the eunuch turn on him now for blackmailing the Proprietor? Bo\nwasn’t here. Adamat didn’t even know if the Privileged was alive. Adamat\ndidn’t know where Sergeant Oldrich was. No one would ask questions if the\neunuch quietly killed them both and disappeared.\n“She’s safe,” the eunuch said.\n“Thank you.”\nThe eunuch was surprisingly gentle as he helped Faye into the room.\nAdamat stepped toward them, arms out.\nThe stiletto handle seemed to materialize in the side of the eunuch’s\nneck. When he opened his mouth, blood poured out, and he dropped to his\nknees. Faye, suddenly unsupported, toppled to the side, only to be caught by\nLord Vetas.\nCHAPTER\n25\nN\no one moved at Tamas’s shouted order. The thick chaos of soldiers\nmilling against the edge of the river did not change.\nTamas felt his heart begin to beat faster.\n“Men of the Seventh! Take the line!”\nNothing. His hands shook. He’d overplayed himself. This false panic\nhe’d meant to create had become real. He’d defeated himself before the\nbattle even began.\n“First Battalion!” a voice cut through the crowd. Someone shoved their\nway out of the press. It was old Colonel Arbor. He held his rifle in one\nhand, his teeth in the other. “To the line, First Battalion!”\nTamas swung around. The Kez cavalry continued to advance slowly.\nThey were a half a mile out on the western front. The dragoons to the south\nbegan to move forward. Vlora and the rest of the powder mages continued\nto fire from across the river, whittling away at their numbers.\nAdran infantry began to peel away from the mob by the river and get to\ntheir positions.

They\nthrew themselves to the safe side of the mound and readied their rifles,\nloading bullets and fixing bayonets. Tamas took a deep breath. He felt his\nheart soar. If he could have kissed every one of his men then and there, he\nwould have.\nHe turned back to the Kez advance and his heart stopped.\nThe advance had ceased less than a quarter of a mile from Tamas’s\nposition.\nFifteen thousand Kez cavalry wedged Tamas’s army completely against\nthe river and the mountains.\nHe saw a man ride to the front of the cuirassiers. Had Beon figured out\nTamas’s game? Did he sense a trap?\nThe man, Tamas recognized, was Beon je Ipille himself. Brave, to come\nout to the front of his heavy cavalry, when he knew a powder mage’s bullet\nmight end him any second.\nBeon seemed to cock his head at Tamas’s position. His lips moved\nbriefly, then he kissed his sword and raised it.\nA salute. Beon was saluting Tamas. The motion stunned him. You stand\nand fight, the salute seemed to say, when you could have run.\nBeon’s sword fell and the earth trembled as fifteen thousand sets of\nhooves thundered toward Tamas.\n“Hold!” Tamas yelled, gripping his rifle. He turned away from the\ncuirassiers. Their charge would be stopped by the sharpened stakes and\ncrosses. They’d pull up hard and exchange fire with the Ninth, or advance\nslowly to try to navigate the defenses.\nBetween Tamas and the dragoons, however, there were no such apparent\nobstacles—only a thin layer of white fog over the ground and then the\nraised earthworks behind which his men crouched.\nThree hundred yards. The dragoons leaned over their mounts, urging\nthem faster. A bullet whistled over Tamas’s head and took a dragoon\nbetween the eyes. Tamas raised his rifle, lined up a shot, and fired. He\nlowered, reloaded, and repeated.\nTwo hundred yards. Dragoons raised their carbines and twisted their\nfaces in wordless cries.\nOne hundred yards. Tamas’s lines opened fire. Hundreds of dragoons\nfell from the first volley alone. The rest charged on, heedless of their\ncomrades’ fall.\nSeventy yards. The dragoons opened fire with their carbines. Tamas’s\nsoldiers crouched behind their earthen wall, reloading.\nFifty yards. Dragoons let their carbines drop and raised their pistols.\nThirty yards. The line of dragoons aimed pistols.\nTwenty yards.\nTen yards.\nThe front line of dragoons disappeared.\nTamas closed his eyes for a brief moment as the screams reached him.\nThe momentum of the cavalry unit at full gallop had carried them\nheadfirst into a concealed trench.

They cracked under the weight of the warhorses.\nTamas had once seen a row of carriages go straight into the Adsea. The\nfirst carriage had plunged around a steep corner and off the end of a pier.\nThe second had followed, the driver seeing the drop only at the last second,\nwhile the third driver’s attempts to slow his horses had failed.\nThis was much like that, but instead of three carriages, it was thousands\nand thousands of dragoons heading straight into his trench.\nBy the time the dragoons had managed to arrest their charge, the trench\nwas nearly filled with screaming, thrashing horses and writhing men trying\nto escape the press. The line of Kez dragoons stared in horror at their fallen\ncomrades.\nTamas shuddered at the thought of being at the bottom of that trench.\n“Fire!” Tamas yelled.\nThe Seventh Brigade opened fire at the Kez dragoons. Their horses\nmilled in panic at the edge of the trench, officers shouting and waving their\nswords, trying to get the horses at the rear of the column to back up so they\ncould organize a withdrawal.\nTamas reloaded and fired again. The dragoons began to organize. If they\nwere given a chance to disengage, they still had thousands left. They could\nreorganize and hound Tamas’s flank when he turned to deal with the\ncuirassiers.\n“Bayonets!” Tamas ordered, lifting his rifle in the air.\nEvery forty paces of the trench, they’d left a ten-foot-wide path of solid\nground. They were unmarked, and the way would be unsure in the fog, but\nTamas had to counterattack.\nTamas headed across the closest of these paths, straight into the flank of\nthe withdrawing Kez dragoons.\nHe reached out with his senses, taking in the closest powder charges and\nigniting them with his mind. The small explosions killed men and horse\nalike, rattling Tamas’s teeth from their proximity. His soldiers flooded\naround him, howling as they set upon the dragoons with their long-sword\nbayonets.\nThe melee erupted along the whole line as the five thousand men of the\nSeventh Brigade slammed into the Kez dragoons. Without the impact of\ntheir charge, and against the long reach of sword bayonets, the dragoons\nlost their advantage.\nTamas ran toward the closest dragoon. He thrust his bayonet up and into\nthe man’s exposed side, then jerked his rifle savagely to tear open the\nwound. The man fell from his horse, and Tamas danced back out of the way\nas the animal panicked and bolted.\nSomething hit him hard from the side, knocking him off his feet. He\nlanded on the ground, the breath knocked from him, and was immediately\npushing himself back up.\n“Sir!” Olem had lost his rifle and drawn his sword. He rammed it into\nthe thigh of a dragoon and made a dash for Tamas.\nTamas got to his feet, only to have Olem hit him full on in the chest.\nThey both went down as a straight cavalry sword whooshed through the air\nwhere Tamas’s head had been."

He drew his sword.\n“Time to back off, sir,” Olem shouted over the din of gunfire.\n“We’re not done here yet. Seventh!” Tamas slid his sword into its\nscabbard and pulled a rifle out of the mud. It still had its bayonet fixed. He\npointed it at the closest dragoon and ran, hoping Olem was behind him.\nHe reached out, detonating more powder as he drew closer to the\ndragoons once more. On either side of him, his infantry pressed the attack.\nTamas felt a stinging breeze along the right side of his head, just above\nhis ear. He felt suddenly dizzy, but charged on. Each step, however, the\ndragoons seemed to get farther away.\nIt took Olem yelling into his ear to bring him back to reality. “They’ve\nretreated, sir!”\nTamas stopped and looked about him, taking in the carnage. Thousands\nhad died in that charge, and thousands more were stuck in that trench—\nbroken men and horses dying a slow death. The screams rang in his ears.\n“Right. Back to the line.” He grabbed Olem’s arm to steady himself.\nThey took a safe path across the trench. The rest of the Seventh had\nturned away from the retreating dragoons and were making sure none of the\nrest would get out of the trench alive. Tamas saw one dragoon grab an\nAdran soldier’s foot and beg for mercy. The soldier put his bayonet through\nthe dragoon’s eye.\nTamas felt Olem’s hand on his shoulder.\n“You’ve taken a bullet along the side of your head, sir,” Olem said.\nTamas touched his head and his fingers came back crimson.\n“A straight crease,” Olem said. “Bloody, but doesn’t look deep.”\nOlem’s left arm hung at his side. His sleeve was in bloody tatters, nearly\ncut from him. He noted Tamas’s questioning gaze. “Just a flesh wound, sir.”\n“Tamas, you bloody dog!” a voice bellowed. “The Ninth has crumbled!\nOur flank is lost!”\nThe words brought Tamas’s head up and around. Gavril rode by at full\ntilt, followed by the rest of his rangers heading to the west.\n“Colonel Arbor!” Tamas cast about for the colonel, finding him near the\nedge of the trench, taking a pair of wounded Kez officers prisoner.\n“Sir!”\n“Hold this position.” Tamas waved his sword over his head. “Men of the\nSeventh, to me!”\nTamas began to sprint to the west, fueled by adrenaline and the powder\nof the battle. Already, he could see the damage. There were countless\ncuirassiers inside the line of defenses.

The defenses\nhad all but collapsed, except for a small knot of men. Tamas recognized\nGeneral Cethal on horseback. Even as he caught sight of the general,\nCethal’s horse was pulled down.\nTamas came up short. He stamped the butt of his rifle on the ground and\nshouted to be heard.\n“Line, form!”\nOlem fell in beside him. To his left and right, soldiers of the Seventh\nstood shoulder to shoulder.\n“Load!”\nRifles and muskets were quickly loaded.\n“Aim!”\nHis men brought their weapons to their shoulders.\n“Fire!”\nThe Seventh fired above the heads of the milling members of the Ninth.\nA slew of cuirassiers fell from their horses.\n“Bayonets, forward!”\nThe “aim and fire” had given the rest of the Seventh time to fall in\nbehind him. Tamas now had an infantry wall six lines deep, bayonets\nbristling. They marched forward, lockstep. Soldiers of the Ninth fell in or\nwere pushed aside. He aimed his line directly toward where he’d seen\nGeneral Cethal fall.\nThey encountered the heavy cavalry thirty paces later.\nCuirassiers locked in combat had lost their greatest weapon—the charge\n—but they had some advantages over dragoons. They were armored,\nproviding protection against bayonets, and their heavy sabers were more\neffective against armed infantry.\n“Hold the line!” Tamas ordered as his men began to bring down\ncuirassiers. They stabbed and slashed, putting the men and horses down\nbefore stepping past them and continuing the push.\nTamas spotted General Cethal through a break in the fighting. Cethal\nwas on the ground, twenty paces away. His face and hands were bloody, his\nsaber raised above him. A dismounted cuirassier knocked Cethal’s sword to\none side and thrust with his own.\nTamas broke his formation, charging between two men on horseback.\nThe cuirassier above Cethal drew his sword back and thrust again. Cethal’s\nbody twitched.\nThe cuirassier didn’t even see Tamas.\nTamas’s bayonet entered the spot beneath his arm where the straps of his\nbreastplate met. Tamas rammed the bayonet in deeper, pushing it until the\nbarrel of his rifle was soaked in blood. He pushed a final time and let go of\nthe rifle, throwing himself to his knees at Cethal’s side.\nCethal stared back up at him in horror, his hands crimson with his own\nblood.\nTamas heard the clash of swords and Olem’s challenging yell, but they\nall seemed distant to him.\nCethal had been stabbed at least four times through the chest and\nstomach. His hands were covered with countless cuts, and his face was a\nmess. He blinked at Tamas through the blood.\n“My boys,” he gasped, “they broke.”\nTamas took Cethal’s hand in his and squeezed.\nThe ultimate betrayal. Your men breaking and running, fleeing around\nyou.\n“You didn’t,” Tamas said. “You stood.”\n“I’m not a coward,” Cethal said. “Bloody Beon. Never seen cuirassiers"

I wanted to…\nto run, myself. Damned cuirassiers.” He blinked again. “You find Beon\nand…” He coughed, and cleared his throat. “… give him my regards. That\nwas a bloody fine bit of horsemanship.” He pulled his hand out of Tamas’s\nand used it to try and staunch another wound. “Go on. Men need you. I’ll\nbe… fine.”\nTamas stripped off his coat and put it beneath Cethal’s head. He stood\nup. His line of infantry had passed him and pushed on. He wrenched his\nbayonet out of the cuirassier’s body and ran to catch up.\nThe heavy cavalry had fallen back. All but a handful had been unhorsed,\nand those had turned tail to flee. One by one, pockets of Kez cuirassiers\nsurrendered.\nHe caught sight of the last of the fighting. His soldiers pressed in,\npresenting a wall of bristling bayonets to the remaining Kez. Tamas\nshouldered his way into the melee, and was not the least bit surprised to\nfind Beon at the center of it.\nBeon’s helmet was gone. His breastplate hung off him by one strap, and\nthe side of his cheek had been laid open. He favored one arm. Beside him\nthe last of his bodyguards was run through and thrown to the ground. Beon\nstepped back, hair soaked with blood and sweat, and threw down his sword.\n“I surrender,” he said loudly. “We surrender.”\nOne of the Adran soldiers stepped forward. He cocked his rifle back and\naimed his bayonet at Beon’s neck.\nTamas could stand it no more. The blood. The neglect of mercy. He\ndashed forward and grabbed the soldier’s rifle by the hot muzzle and thrust\nit aside.\n“He said,” Tamas proclaimed loudly, “that he surrenders.”\nAdamat lurched forward, a curse on his lips, only to stop when Vetas\npressed the stiletto against Faye’s neck.\n“I promised you pain tenfold,” Vetas said. “I want you to remember\nthat.” His forearm flexed, and Adamat closed his eyes, unwilling to watch\nFaye’s life blood spill from her throat.\n“Step away from him.”\nAdamat opened his eyes. Vetas looked slightly confused. His forearm\nstrained, but the stiletto got no closer to Faye’s throat.\n“Please,” Bo said, coming around the corner, “just step off to one side.”\nAdamat snatched Faye, pulling her away from Vetas.

Bo walked up\nbeside Vetas and took the man’s chin in hand roughly, turning his head to\nsee the dead Privileged.\n“She was good,” Bo said. “Real worthy of cabal membership. That’s\nwhat I did to her. The other one—your backup—he wasn’t that skilled. It\nonly took a moment. And you.” Bo tapped a gloved finger beneath Vetas’s\nchin. “I don’t like you.

Vetas was still pinned\nto the wall by Bo’s sorcery. Bo said, “I bet you were the type of child who\ntortured animals for fun. Tell me, did you ever pull the wings off of\ninsects?”\nVetas didn’t respond.\n“Answer me!” Bo bellowed.\nVetas flinched. “Yes.”\n“That’s what I thought.

That’s the point among you types, isn’t it? To keep them alive as\nlong as possible?” Bo smacked Vetas once, then again. “Isn’t it? Tell me!\nIsn’t it?”\nAdamat lurched forward and grabbed Bo’s arm. Bo whirled on him,\nhands raised, fire in his eyes. Adamat did his best not to shy away. “That’s\nenough, man! Enough!” He couldn’t believe himself. Dashing forward to\nspare Vetas. An hour ago, Adamat was ready to do every pain in the world\nto Vetas.

Get them\nout of here.”\nAdamat put an arm around Faye’s waist, letting her take the weight off\nher ankle as he led her out of the smoldering ruin of a building.\nThe street was filled with people. Onlookers stood well back, a hundred\npaces at least, their curiosity warring with their fear of the sorcery.\nImmediately in front of the building, the eunuch’s men had gathered with\ntheir wounded and prisoners, and some were heading inside now that the\nfire and smoke were gone.

She limped over to him.\n“Vetas, he…”\n“He’s inside,” Adamat said, choking back anger. Fell had told him she\ncould hold Vetas. She had obviously been overpowered.

The room was lined with rich crimson damask and smelled heavily of\ncigar smoke. The armchairs scattered throughout the club had been\nupholstered with the furs of big cats from the Gurlish continent. In one\ncorner, a sergeant was playing a grand piano. The conversation was somber\nand muted, though a few officers seemed to note Taniel’s entrance.\nTaniel paused in the doorway and adjusted the collar of his dress\nuniform—a gift from Mihali. Most of his possessions had been lost when\nSouth Pike collapsed, including his various uniforms. Somehow the fat chef\nhad gotten Taniel’s measurements and had had a new one made for him. It\neven had the proper silver buttons with powder kegs on them.\nHe examined the room slowly, hat tucked under his arm, and tried not to\nthink about the provosts waiting outside for him. If he failed to apologize,\nhe imagined they’d take him straight back to his quarters.\nTaniel spotted Major Doravir near the bar, playing cards with an older\nofficer of about fifty and two other majors.

I understand Tamas’s\ncull was a political thing, but there’s no arguing that the lack of nobility\namong his officers has cheapened the whole army.

If he couldn’t… get to it, Captain, I’m\nthirsty.”\nTaniel ignored the colonel. “Major Doravir,” Taniel said.\nDoravir glanced up from her cards. “You’re being rude to Colonel\nBertthur.”\nBertthur? Where did he know that name from? “My apologies,\nColonel”—Taniel didn’t look at the man—“but I must speak with Major\nDoravir.”\n“It’s ‘Colonel’ now,” Doravir said, touching the bars at her collar. “And\nwhatever you have to say to me”—she set her cards facedown on the table\nand leaned back in her chair—“can be said in public.”\nTaniel swallowed a mouthful of bile. “Congratulations on your\npromotion, Colonel.”\n“I say,” Bertthur stood up.\n“Sit down, sir,” Taniel snapped. “This has nothing to do with you.\nColonel Doravir, I’d like to offer my deepest apologies for any”—Taniel\nrolled the sentence around in his head, trying not to spit it out—“insult I\nmay have given you with my recent conduct.”\nTaniel couldn’t help but notice that the murmur of conversation had\ncompletely disappeared. It felt as if a hundred sets of eyes were staring at\nhim. They probably were.\n“Colonel Bertthur is my husband,” Doravir said. “Apologize to him.”\nHusband? The man must have been twenty years her senior.\n“I did,” Taniel said. “And I apologized to you. Now if you’ll excuse\nme.” Taniel turned on his heel.\nHe paused when Bertthur cleared his throat. “Was that Taniel? Tamas’s\nbrat?”\nKeep walking, Taniel told himself.\n“Two-Shot,” Bertthur said. “Come back here this instant. Colonel Etan!”\nTaniel froze. Etan was here?\n“Colonel, isn’t this the man who got you crippled?”\n“He’s the man who saved my life,” Etan’s voice returned.\n“He saved my life, too!” someone shouted.\n“And mine!”\n“Bah. I remember you now, Two-Shot,” Bertthur said. “It must have\nbeen five, six years ago. A whiny little bastard. A piss-poor soldier. You’d\nrather run off with that dark-haired whore of yours, neglecting your\ntraining. I never saw anything in you. Huh. Looks like she didn’t either.”\nA whore? Vlora?

He might have wanted to call her that and worse when\nhe’d caught her with that fop at the university, but Taniel would be damned\nif he’d let some fool officer go on about his love life. He balled his hands\ninto fists and slowly took a breath to calm himself. He didn’t have to listen\nto this. He could just walk away.\n“Bertthur, I think you’ve had enough,” Etan’s voice said. “Perhaps it’s\ntime to retire for the evening.”\n“Go to the pit, Etan,” Bertthur went on. “Taniel, I can see that things\nhaven’t changed. No respect for authority. No military decorum. You’ve\njust traded one whore for another.”\n“Bertthur!” Etan’s voice held some warning.\n“But now it’s a savage whore! What will he think of next? I bet your\nfather is rolling over in his grave every time you bed that bitch.”\nTaniel’s whole body shook. The fury threatened to overwhelm him. He\nforced himself to remain calm. Slowly, he turned around.\n“Bertthur,” Taniel said. “I don’t remember a Colonel Bertthur. I\nremember a Captain Bertthur. An ass of a man who held his rank only\nbecause he was the bastard son of a duke. Field Marshal Tamas swore that\nman would never hold a higher rank as long as he was left alive.”\nBertthur turned red. “That’s a week in the stocks for you, Two-Shot.”\n“You’re a braggart and a fool, Bertthur. You’re a disgrace to the\nuniform.”\n“Two weeks!”\nTaniel charged toward Bertthur and the officer shrank back, as if\nexpecting to be punched. Taniel gripped the colonel’s bars on his collar and\nripped them off, tossing them to the side.\n“A month!” Bertthur roared.\nSomething soared through the air and struck Bertthur in the side of the\nface. It looked like mashed potatoes.\n“Who did that?” Doravir demanded.\nA dinner roll hit Bertthur on the nose. He reeled back, suddenly under\nassault from every manner of dinner food. Someone flung a whole dish of\nsauce on him, staining his uniform.\n“You’re not a free man anymore, Two-Shot!” Bertthur fumed. “Your\nfather is dead. You’ll see two months in the stocks, and I’ll hand your little\nsavage whore over to my men!”\nTaniel took a step forward and plowed his fist into Bertthur’s chin,\nsending the older man to the ground. He could hear the crack of the\nbastard’s jaw breaking.\n“Provosts!” Doravir shouted.\nDamn this. Damn them all. Taniel righted Berrthur’s chair with his foot\nand leapt up on it.\n“Friends,” he shouted, raising his arms for quiet. The officers’ mess\nsuddenly calmed, and to Taniel’s surprise, he had silence within moments.\n“The General Staff has deceived us all,” Taniel said. “Field Marshal Tamas\nis not dead. He hasn’t even been captured. He’s leading the Seventh and\nNinth through Kez as we speak.”\n“A lie!” Doravir shouted."

He’s leading the Seventh and\nNinth through Kez as we speak.”\n“A lie!” Doravir shouted.\nTamas raised his voice to drown her out. “Haven’t you wondered where\nthe Kez cavalry are? They’re chasing Tamas!”\nTaniel was shoved off the chair by a provost. The man had no sooner\nlaid his hands on Taniel than a major tackled him to the floor. Taniel got to\nhis feet. “We only have to hold these Kez bastards for a few more months!\nFall will be here soon and then winter, and Field Marshal Tamas with it!”\nA musket butt slammed Taniel in the stomach. He doubled over in pain,\nbut forced himself up. “No retreat! No surrender!”\nThe officers’ mess erupted in a roar of cheering. Food was flying\neverywhere. Taniel was forced to the floor by the back of his neck, his face\nground into the carpet.\n“You’re finished, Two-Shot,” Doravir hissed. “You’re a dead man!”\nTaniel didn’t care. The officers would all tell their men, and their men\nwould hold the line. They’d do it for Taniel. They’d do it for Tamas.\nNila felt a sense of dread grow in the pit of her stomach as she neared\nVetas’s manor. Black smoke billowed above the street, and men’s screams\ncarried on the wind. The sound of fighting grew more distinct as she drew\ncloser, and above it all a sound that she’d only heard once or twice in her\nlife but was unmistakable—the thump of sorcery.\nIt had to be Privileged Dourford. She could see the tall Privileged in her\nmind’s eye, laughing gleefully as he slung sorcery at unknown attackers,\nburning men to a crisp with the flick of his fingers.\nThe sorcery seemed to have an echo. There’d be a thump, and then\nanother one just as loud if not louder almost immediately after. The combat\nwas still going on as she rounded the corner of the next street over and\napproached the manor from the rear. Smoke poured from the windows on\nall three stories of the manor. Flames licked the smoke, curling like fingers\naround the window frames. A crash, and then another.\nNo, this wasn’t any echo.\nSorcery fought sorcery inside the building.\nNila ran toward the manor, her dress gathered in both hands. She\nremembered hearing the kitchen staff say that Lord Vetas had called a\nsecond Privileged from somewhere down south. She was supposed to have\narrived this morning. Was that woman fighting Dourford?\nThere was a great whump and Nila felt her ears pop. She staggered to\none side of the street, trying to keep her feet. The flames had disappeared\nfrom the manor. Another whump, and the smoke burst from the windows as\nif propelled by a giant bellows, and no more followed it out.\nNila froze in her tracks, more frightened by the sudden silence than she\nhad been by the sorcery. Who had won? Who had even been fighting? Was\nVetas in there? Was he still alive? Could Jakob have survived all of that?\nShe didn’t know if she could make herself go inside. She took several\ndeep breaths, gathering her courage."

        "text": "Vetas in there? Was he still alive? Could Jakob have survived all of that?\nShe didn’t know if she could make herself go inside. She took several\ndeep breaths, gathering her courage.\nA crack split the air, throwing Nila off her feet. She landed on the street\nhard enough to scrape the skin off her palm.\nOne side of the house collapsed, crashing in on itself. She stared,\nopenmouthed, as the walls crumpled and part of the roof slid off one side,\nclay shingles falling into the alley with a sound like a thousand wind chimes\nin a hurricane.\nNila climbed to her feet and was running toward the house before she\ncould think. Her palm throbbed, her dress bloody, but she didn’t care about\nthat. Jakob was still inside, up on the second floor. His nursery faced the\nother street, and even at this angle she could tell that if he was inside, he’d\nbeen crushed. But maybe he was lucky. Maybe he’d been under the bed, or\nprotected by the door frame, or…\nThe back wall of the manor suddenly blew outward, sending plaster,\nfurniture, and bits of what looked to have once been a human out into the\nstreet.\nA man stood in the wreckage. He was of medium height, with ruddy\nmuttonchops on an otherwise clean-shaven face and loose pants and\nmatching jacket that wouldn’t have looked out of place on a street in the\nbankers’ quarter. He wasn’t particularly handsome, nor was he ugly, but\nNila felt a jolt when she first saw him.\nHe held his hands high, fingers poised in white Privileged’s gloves as he\nlooked down on the mess he’d just made all over the thoroughfare. The\ngathering crowd pulled back in fear. A woman fainted when she realized\nwhat the juicy red meat scattered in the street was. A man vomited.\nThe Privileged surveyed the gathered crowd and lowered his hands. He\nturned and disappeared inside the wreckage of the house. Before he did,\nhowever, Nila caught sight of something on his gloves: the symbol of the\nAdran Mountains with the teardrop of the Adsea beneath them.\nThis wasn’t just any Privileged. This was a member of the Adran royal\ncabal.\nSomething told Nila that Dourford hadn’t stood a chance.\nNila picked her way through the wreckage and ducked beneath a beam,\nentering the house as close as she could get to the servants’ stairs.\nThe sitting room was completely crushed. She could hear a man calling\nfor help, and another moaning. A body lay in the mangled timber, covered\nin plaster dust, unmoving. She heard someone speaking from the other\nroom. It sounded like Lord Vetas.\nNila moved slowly into the kitchen. It remained almost completely\nuntouched by the collapse, but it seemed that the servants’ stairs had taken\nthe worst of it. She wouldn’t be climbing up to the second floor that way.\nShe stepped over to the door to the dining room and listened. Silence,\nbut she could hear someone moving. She looked through a crack in the\ndoor. She heard herself gasp at the sight of a woman, body hanging limply\nfrom dripping shards of ice, nailed to the back wall of the dining room. She\nwore Privileged’s gloves. Vetas’s other Privileged?"

He was saying…\nLord Vetas slammed into the back wall of the dining room hard enough\nto rattle the remains of the house. Something shifted in the wreckage, and\nNila heard someone scream. Lord Vetas, though, didn’t make a sound. The\nAdran Privileged stepped into view. He spoke quietly, his face angry. He\ngrabbed Lord Vetas by the chin and forced him to look at the dead\nPrivileged.\nThe Adran Privileged stepped back suddenly. His voice was suddenly\ncalm and collected. Nila heard him say, “I bet you were the type of child\nwho tortured animals for fun. Tell me, did you ever pull the wings off of\ninsects? Answer me!”\nNila had some satisfaction in seeing Vetas pull back in fear. His mouth\nmoved, the word too low to hear.\n“That’s what I thought. How does it feel?”\nNila pulled away from the door. Vetas’s scream drowned out the calls of\nthe wounded and dying in the rest of the house. She turned toward the\nkitchen, looking for another way to get through the wreckage. Panic set in.\nShe had to find Jakob. She had to get away from the house. Even as she\nbegan to breathe harder, the adrenaline setting in, a wave of relief swept\nover her. Vetas was gone. If he wasn’t dead yet, he would be. That bastard\nhad finally found someone stronger and crueler.\nShe put him from her mind. He wasn’t worth another thought. Jakob,\nthough…\n“Nila?”\nNila’s gaze darted around the kitchen. A child’s voice. Where had it\ncome from?\n“Nila, quick, hide in here.”\nShe found Jakob in the bottom of the pantry, tucked behind a sack of\nflour. She glanced at the door to the dining room. “There’s no room for me\nin there,” she said, helping him out of the pantry.\n“What about Faye?” Jakob asked. “And Uncle Vetas.”\nA moan emanated from the dining room. Nila took Jakob by the\nshoulder and pushed him out through the broken wall the same way she’d\ncome in.\nThe crowd outside had retreated to what they deemed a safe distance\nfrom the house, seemingly content to wait for the police and fire brigades to\narrive. Someone grabbed Nila by the arm as she pushed her way through the\nthrong. She shoved them off without a comment, not bothering to look\nback, and kept her grip on Jakob’s shoulder.\nHer mind was already racing. She still had her buried silver outside the\ncity. She had no money, no clothes but the ones on her back. They’d have to\nwalk all the way to the city limits, find the silver, and then tomorrow they\ncould come back into the city and find a place to sell it.\nA night or two spent sleeping in the street wouldn’t kill them.\nThey were four blocks away, when Nila noticed that everyone she\npassed was staring at her. It was another block before Jakob pointed at her\ndress and she realized that the blood from her palm was everywhere. It\nlooked like she’d been rolling in it. Two more streets down and they"

It\nlooked like she’d been rolling in it. Two more streets down and they\nreached a string of shops.\n“Do you need help, ma’am?” a passing gentleman asked, pressing a\nhandkerchief to his mouth. He looked queasy at the sight of her.\nShe showed him her palm. “Just skinned it, is all,” she said, trying to\nkeep her tone level. “Looks worse than it is.”\nThe gentleman seemed relieved. “There’s a doctor right over there,” he\nsaid, pointing two shops down. “She accepts walk-ins.”\n“Thank you so much,” Nila said.\nShe waited for a moment until the gentleman continued on his way. She\nhad no way to pay for a doctor. She’d have to deal with the pain until…\nNila remembered the silver necklace with the large pearl hanging about\nher neck. A “gift” from Vetas.\nThe doctor was an older woman in a white dress and sharp eyeglasses\nperched on her nose. She was seeing a patient, but one look at Nila’s bloody\ndress and she rushed to see what was the matter.\nNila did her best to make small talk as the doctor cleaned and then\nwrapped her wound. She had fallen, Nila told the doctor. A nasty fall, but\nnothing was sprained. Payment? “Oh, my. I seem to have left my\npocketbook at home. Can you keep this necklace until I return to pay you?”\nThe arrangement was struck, and Nila even borrowed a fifty-krana note\nagainst the necklace. She pulled Jakob out the door, relieved that he’d\nstayed quiet through the entire exchange.\nNila had only gone another half a block before a thought struck her.\nThe Privileged. The one who’d come out victorious and then torn\nVetas’s arms off—he was a member of the Adran royal cabal.\n“Jakob,” Nila said, directing him over to a street side café, “can you wait\nhere for a few minutes?”\nJakob’s eyes grew wide. “Don’t leave me alone.”\n“Just for a few minutes. Here, let me buy you glass of milk. Sit right\nhere, inside, and wait for me to come back.” She paused, thinking. “If I\ndon’t come back, I want you to ask directions to the nearest barracks. Tell\nthe commanding officer that you’re looking for Captain Olem. He’ll be\naway, fighting on the front, but the officer will help you find someplace to\nstay.”\n“You’re not coming back for me?”\n“I am,” Nila said, “but just in case I don’t, that’s what you’re to do.”\nThe boy seemed to take stock of her confidence and straightened his\nback. “Yes, Nila.”\nShe bought him a glass of milk and put him on a chair just inside the\ncafé, asking the waiter to keep an eye on him for half an hour. Ten krana\nbought her an old apron from the café, and she wrapped it around her\nmiddle.

It concealed the blood on her dress nicely.\nThen Nila backtracked her way to Lord Vetas’s manor.\nThe police had arrived, and the fire brigades were crawling all over the\nmanor. A white sheet had been laid over the remains of Dourford, and the\nfire brigades pulled a twisted body from the wreckage. All of Lord Vetas’s\nmen had disappeared, along with whomever they were fighting. The\nnumber of police kept her from wanting to get any closer to the building.\nShe began to make a circuit of the area, checking each of the nearby\nstreets. Surely there were lookouts, or… or… someone!\nNila found nothing. Lord Vetas’s men, the Adran soldiers, the cabal\nPrivileged; they’d scattered to the wind.\nShe widened her search.\nIt wasn’t until five streets over that she caught sight of a man with ruddy\nmuttonchops and a pressed suit of clothes walking along the thoroughfare\nwith a wide rug, rolled thick enough that it might have a body inside, over\nhis shoulder. He wasn’t wearing any Privileged’s gloves, but Nila knew it\nwas the same man—the cabal Privileged.\nShe ran to catch up with him. He walked slowly under the weight of the\nrug and he was whistling loudly to himself. Surely this couldn’t be the same\nman?\nHe turned a corner.\nSlowly, Nila crept up to the edge of the building. Maybe it wasn’t him.\nPrivileged didn’t carry things themselves. They had servants for that.\nShe rounded the corner and nearly screamed.\nAbout ten feet down the alley, the man was sitting on his rolled rug. He\nhad his feet up on an old wine barrel as if he’d been there all day.\n“Can I help you?” he asked.\nNila glanced into the street. Surely he wouldn’t harm her. Not on a busy\nstreet in broad daylight.\n“Sir,” she said. How to talk to a Privileged? She’d spent some time with\nRozalia when she was with the royalists months ago, but that had made her\njust as uncomfortable. Privileged were not to be trusted. “My lord?”\nHis eyes narrowed, but he didn’t correct her. This was the same man, all\nright. And he didn’t like someone noticing that he was a Privileged. She\nbraced herself, ready to run.\n“Yes?” he asked, his voice amiable.\n“You’re a Privileged,” she said. “From the Adran Cabal.”\nThe man raised an eyebrow. “What makes you think that?”\n“I saw you splatter Lord Dourford across the cobbles about an hour\nago.”\n“That was his name?” the Privileged said. “I thought he looked familiar.\nThat pompous prick was a member of the Kez Cabal. Bah, I’m surprised\nthey let him in. Less talent than a Knacked.” He looked her up and down.\n“Now what can I do for you? Make it good, because I’ll have to kill you\nafter.”\nKill her? Nila had no doubt he would, given the need. Members of the\nroyal cabals were notoriously cruel. She cleared her throat and straightened\nher back. “Due to your duty as a member of the royal cabal, I will give into"

She cleared her throat and straightened\nher back. “Due to your duty as a member of the royal cabal, I will give into\nyour protection Jakob Eldaminse, next in line for the crown of Adro.” She\nlet out a sharp breath, only now realizing that she’d been holding it.\nThe Privileged’s eyebrow remained cocked. Slowly, as if realizing that\nshe was serious, the eyebrow lowered. He threw his head back and laughed.\nNila felt a nervous smile dance upon her lips. Had she said something\nfunny? “You’ll do it, then?”\n“What? Oh, pit no. You think I want some noble brat hanging on my\nhip? That kid is, what, four?”\n“Six.”\n“Six. Right.” The Privileged stood up. “The Adran nobility is dead.\nThey’re not coming back.” He paused and looked around. “Where is the\nboy, anyway?”\n“Hiding.”\n“Smart.”\n“Sir,” Nila said. “My lord, you have to. He has no one else to protect\nhim.”\n“He seems to have you.”\n“I’m just a laundress.”\n“You dress like a waiter.”\n“The apron? No, I’m a laundress.”\n“I’m pretty sure that you’re a waiter,” the Privileged said.\nIt took her several moments to realize that she was being teased.\n“My lord!” she said in a voice that she hoped was commanding, “you\nhave to protect Jakob Eldaminse.”\n“No, I don’t.” The Privileged sighed as if suddenly tired, and though\nhe’d looked to be in his midtwenties just a moment ago, he suddenly\nseemed elderly. “I’m done with the Adran nobility.” He blinked and then\nseemed to look more closely at her. “Have we met before?”\nShe shook her head.\n“Oh well. I should be off. This rug won’t keep all day.”\nNila felt a rising panic inside her. It hadn’t worked. The Privileged\nwouldn’t protect Jakob. It wasn’t as if she were trying to hand the boy off,\nshe told herself. It was that he needed better protectors than she. “You’re\nnot going to…”\n“Kill you? No. You’re trying to hide one of the last living members of\nManhouch’s extended family. You’re not going to tell anyone about me\nanytime soon.”\n“I will,” Nila said.\n“Excuse me?”\n“I will tell them. Unless you swear to protect Jakob.”\n“You’re adorable.”\n“I’m serious.”\n“I’m sure you are.” The Privileged bent and lifted one edge of the rug,\ntipping it upward against the wall and examining it for a moment as if\nfiguring out the best way to get it back on his shoulders.\nNila felt numb. What would she do now? Sure, she could get ahold of\nsome money, but what then? “Your rug is bleeding.”\n“So it is,” the Privileged said, glancing at the dark stain soaking through\nthe fabric. “I thought I cauterized those wounds.”\nA cold finger crept its way up Nila’s spine. “Who is that?” she asked.\n“Him? Some idiot named Vetal or something.”\n“Vetas?”\n“Yeah. Him.”"

For information,” he added.\nNila stumbled away from the rug and leaned up against the wall of the\nalley. She felt like she was going to be ill. Everything had been so clear in\nher mind as she’d escaped Vetas’s grasp. Now it was full of questions. Part\nof her wanted to cry. She quelled the feeling and stared at the wall, trying to\ncome up with some kind of plan.\nShe was surprised to find the Privileged still standing there a few\nmoments later.\n“Don’t you have something to do with that?” she said, jerking her chin\nat the rug.\nThe Privileged stepped closer. Nila refused to step back.\n“My name’s Bo,” he said.\nNila sniffed.\n“Look, I won’t keep the boy,” Bo said. “I’m not in any position to\nprotect him. I’m a hunted man myself. But I can give you two a few days of\nsafety while you figure out what to do.”\n“Why?”\nBo chuckled. “Because you’re brave enough to demand things of a\nPrivileged on your own, and from what I gather, you know this fellow”—he\ntapped the rug with his toe—“and because you’re rather attractive. A few\ndays is all, though.” He pulled a pencil and paper from his breast pocket and\nscribbled something on it. “I have to go put my rug into storage. Gather the\nboy and meet me at this address. For Kresimir’s sake, make sure you’re not\nfollowed.”\nCHAPTER\n27\nY\nou have to hold still, sir.”\nTamas resisted the urge to twitch away from Olem’s needle. Olem had\nshaved the side of Tamas’s head and cleaned the bullet gash with frigid\nmountain water and now he made tight stitches with catgut. The wound ran\nalmost the entire length of the side of Tamas’s head. It was an eerie feeling,\nknowing that had the path of the bullet been an inch to one side, it would\nhave turned Tamas’s head into a canoe.\n“Sorry,” Tamas muttered.\nThe air reeked of death as the corpses of thousands of men and horses\nstank in the midmorning sun. His soldiers had labored the entire rest of the\nday after the battle and all this morning in an effort to dig all the bodies\nfrom the trench. The men had been laid out, their kits and supplies stripped\nfrom them, while the horses were prepared for eating.\nWar may need decorum, but his army needed food and supplies.\nThe moans and cries of the wounded reached him. Both Kez and Adran\nwere being treated to field surgery in an impromptu hospital. Neither army\nhad a proper team of doctors beyond the rudimentary skills of soldiers\nwho’d seen countless wounds.\nTamas watched as Gavril picked his way through the camp toward him."

A team of engineers was hard at work making a proper\nbridge over the Big Finger. Cook fires everywhere smoked with horsemeat.\nQuartermasters took stock of supplies they’d stripped from both Kez and\nAdran dead. There were piles of boots, kits, blankets, and tents, along with\nrifles, ammunition, even powder horns and charges.\nGavril reached Tamas and sat down on the ground beside him. “General\nCethal is dead.”\nTamas bowed his head for a moment of silence, further frustrating\nOlem’s attempts at stitching.\n“I’m surprised he lasted this long,” Tamas said. “Tough old dog. What\nreports?”\n“Based on the bodies so far, we’re guessing about two thousand dead on\nour side. Another three thousand wounded. About a quarter of those will\njoin the dead within a week. Half our wounded are incapacitated.”\nThirty-five hundred casualties to this battle. Over a fourth of Tamas’s\nfighting force. It was a heavy blow.\n“And the Kez?”\n“Based on bodies alone, we can guess that only twenty-five hundred of\nthem got away. The rest are either dead or captured.”\nTamas let out a long breath. A decisive victory in anyone’s book. Most\nof the enemy, including all of their high officers, either killed or captured.\n“Give our boys a rest,” Tamas said. “Any Kez who can stand, put him to\nwork burying the bodies.”\n“What are we going to do with all these captives?” Gavril asked. “We\ncan’t take them with us. Pit, we can’t even carry our own wounded—don’t\nforget that Beon’s brother is still coming on hard with thirty thousand\ninfantry.”\n“When will he reach us?”\n“Our prisoners are being sketchy about time frames, but piecing things\ntogether, I’d guess they are about a week behind us.”\nClose enough that if Tamas allowed himself to be slowed by wounded\nand prisoners, the Kez infantry would catch him before he could get to\nDeliv.\n“How is Beon?”\n“Asked to see you,” Gavril said.\n“Right. Olem?”\nOlem wiped the needle off on his jacket. “All done, sir. Doesn’t look\npretty, but the stitches are tight. Try not to do any strenuous thinking in the\nnear future.”\nTamas held up a field mirror. “I look like a bloody invalid. Bring me my\nhat.”\n“It’ll rub against the stitches.”\n“Wrap it in a handkerchief. I’m not going to parley with the enemy\nlooking like this.”\nOlem wrapped Tamas’s head, and Tamas gingerly sat his bicorne hat on\ntop of it.\n“How does it feel, sir?”\n“Hurts like the bloody pit.

His left hand was\nwrapped tightly, and fresh blood soaked through his white shirt at the\nshoulder. “Olem, see to yourself,” Tamas said as they neared the prisoners.\n“I’m all right, sir,” Olem said.\n“That’s an order.”\nOlem relented and limped back to camp. Tamas was sorry to see him go,\nbut Olem needed rest and medical attention.\nThe prisoners had been put in a makeshift stockade overnight. They\nwere bound hand and foot and watched over by the Seventh Brigade. The\nNinth couldn’t be trusted with prisoners right now—they’d taken the worst\nof it in the cuirassier charge, and most of them still wanted blood.\n“Field Marshal to see General Beon,” Gavril said to one of the guards.\nThe man headed into the stockade. He emerged a few minutes later with\nBeon in tow.\nThe Kez general didn’t look so well. His left arm was in a sling. Stitches\non his forehead and the back of his right hand looked crooked and painful.\nHe walked with a pronounced limp.\n“General,” Tamas said.\nBeon gave him a weary nod. “Field Marshal. I should thank you for\nsaving my life from your men yesterday.”\n“You are most welcome.”\n“Ah,” Beon said. “I should thank you. But I won’t.” He let his head sag.\n“I don’t know if I can live with the shame of such a defeat.”\nGavril leaned against one of the wooden stakes that made the stockade.\n“Don’t be so hard on yourself,” Gavril said. “It’s Tamas, after all.”\nTamas suppressed his annoyance to keep it from reaching his face.\n“Deceit may not be a gentleman’s tool, but in the end, victory is all that\nmatters on the field of battle.”\n“Too true,” Beon said. “The trench. It was well done. Dug and\nconcealed, all in one afternoon. My scouts kept at bay, and that bit of fog\nconcealed it completely. You played me, Field Marshal. You knew I’d order\nthe charge when I saw you trying to cross the river.”\nTamas allowed himself a small nod.\n“Bravo,” Beon said with a sigh. “What now? As you can see, you’ve\ntaken thousands of us hostage. We’re hundreds of miles from the nearest\ncity that might afford ransom. Thousands of both sides will die of improper\ntreatment and disease within the next couple of weeks.”\n“I’ve sent a man to your camp and called for a parley,” Tamas said. “I\nintend to ransom all of your soldiers and and most of your officers in\nexchange for food, supplies, and a promise of parole.”\n“Parole?” Beon seemed surprised. “As a man of honor, I must tell you\nthat a great number of my officers will not adhere to the conditions of\nparole. The moment your prisoners are free of your hands, they will be set\nback to fighting you.”\n“As a man of honor, I expect you to tell me which of your highest\nofficers are, in fact, men of honor.”\nBeon chuckled. “Ah.

And those are the ones you will ransom back to the\nremnants of my army? I see. You realize, of course, that the honor will only\nstand until my brother catches up with his infantry, and relieves me and my\nofficers of our command?”\n“I do. And I never said I would ransom you.”\nBeon tilted his head to one side. “I can’t imagine any use you would\nhave for me. My presence will not prevent my brother from launching an\nattack when he catches you.”\n“Still. I’d rather you not be on the other side for the time being.”\n“You don’t trust me not to break my parole?”\n“It’s not that, either. By the way, General Cethal sends his regards.”\n“He mounted a valiant defense. I’ve broken greater numbers of infantry\nwith fewer cuirassiers. Tell him it was a fine stand.”\n“He’s dead,” Tamas said.\nBeon lowered his head.\nSomeone cleared his throat. Tamas turned to find a messenger at his\nshoulder.\n“Sir, the Kez are here for the parley.”\n“Of course. General Beon, if you will?”\nThe Kez had sent what remained of their officer corps. A colonel, five\nmajors, and six captains. Tamas ran his eyes over them. The Kez retreat had\nbeen last-minute. Only two of the majors had wounds on them. That meant\nthe rest had fled before even entering the melee.\nThe parley proceeded much as he expected. The Kez rattled their sabers\nand made demands, but in the end, they knew they were beaten. They\ntraded powder and ammunition in exchange for having their surviving\nofficers returned to them—with a few notable exceptions. Food, and\ninformation regarding how things went back in Adro, were exchanged in\nreturn for their soldiers.\n“You cannot possibly think we will allow you to keep Beon je Ipille,”\nthe Kez colonel said. “He is third in line for the crown!”\n“ ‘Allow’ me?” Tamas said. “It is I who am allowing you to leave with\nyour lives. Almost four thousand men in exchange for road rations,\ninformation, and a shaky promise of parole? I’m the one being robbed. I’ll\nkeep General Beon until his father offers to trade safe passage back to Adro\nfor his son’s life. We will make the exchange of prisoners at first light\ntomorrow.”\nThey exchanged information about the landscape in northern Kez and\nthe position of the infantry brigades under Beon’s brother. The Kez returned\nto their camp, noses raised, proud even in defeat.\n“My father hates you,” Beon said as they walked back to the Adran\ncamp. “There isn’t a chance in the pit he’d trade my life for those of your\narmy. Especially after my failure here.”\n“I know.” Tamas stopped and turned to Beon. “You will be accorded\nevery respect due to a prisoner of your status. I expect your word of honor\nthat you will not attempt to escape my camp and that you will not attempt to\ntransfer information about the disposition of my army to your own. In\nexchange, you will be given a tent, full freedom of the camp, and the choice"

In\nexchange, you will be given a tent, full freedom of the camp, and the choice\nof any two menservants from your own army.”\n“I give my word of honor,” Beon said.\n“Very good.”\nBeon was escorted to the stockade to select his menservants, leaving\nTamas alone with Gavril.\n“You really trust him?” Gavril asked.\n“Yes.”\n“Then why are you keeping him here?”\nTamas removed his hat and gingerly touched at the fresh stitches on his\nscalp. It would be months before the hair grew back properly to conceal the\nwound. In the meantime, he would look like some half-mad fool.\n“He’s the only one of Ipille’s sons worth anything as a human being. I\nintend to return to Adro and throw back Ipille’s army. According to\nthem”—he jerked his head in the direction of the retreating Kez officers\n—“Ipille is personally in Adro. If I can manage to kill him and his two\noldest sons, Beon will be king of Kez and he might actually listen to reason\nand help me end this war.”\n“Ah.” Gavril scratched at his beard. “What else did you find out about\nAdro?”\n“Last the Kez cavalry heard, Ipille had burned Budwiel and was slowly\nbut steadily advancing up Surkov’s Alley. Hilanska and the rest of the\ngenerals are holding fast with the help of the Wings of Adom. Supposedly,\nKresimir himself is there, but he’s not using his powers to aid the Kez\narmy.”\n“I thought Kresimir was dead.”\n“That’s not what the Kez think. After South Pike collapsed, Privileged\nBorbador told me that you can’t kill a god.”\n“If he’s alive,” Gavril reasoned, “he probably wants whoever shot him in\nthe face.”\n“I know,” Tamas said. “We march tomorrow afternoon. I need to get\nback to Adro and put myself between the Kez army and my son. If Kresimir\nis alive, I’ll make him wish he had been destroyed at South Pike.”\nAdamat stopped with his hand on the door to a decommissioned grain mill\nin the factory district of Adopest. He looked over his shoulder and tried to\ntell himself he was no longer at risk of being followed. Lord Vetas was\ncaptured, his men taken or scattered, Adamat’s family now safe. He was\nbeing paranoid, he reasoned, and pushed the door in.\nOr was he? He made his way past a secretary’s desk, long empty and\nhalf-rotted, and past the millworkers’ bunk rooms, which smelled like an\nanimal had made a nest in them and then died.\nAdamat had successfully blackmailed the Proprietor. Lord Vetas’s\nmaster, Lord Claremonte, might have other spies in the city. And there was\nstill the Kez army pushing its way north through Surkov’s Alley.\nWould Adamat and his family ever really be safe again?\nHe went through another door that led to the mill’s main workroom.

The\nroom was several hundred feet long with over a dozen millstones placed at\nintervals along one wall. Most of them were either broken or missing\ncompletely, the machinery left to rot when the mill was abandoned. The\nsound of the river, over which this portion of the mill was suspended, filled\nthe room.\nBo sat with his chair tilted back on two legs, leaning against the wall\nnext to the door. Beside him, Fell held a pipe between her lips and stared at\nsomething in the distance. Her shirtsleeves were rolled up, and there were\nflecks of blood on her arms.\n“You missed the morning’s festivities,” Bo said to Adamat.\n“You call torturing a man ‘festivities’?” Adamat asked.\n“I’m not a good person,” Bo said.\nAdamat cast a glance over Bo’s clothes. “You’ve blood on your shoes.”\nBo swore, then licked his thumb and ran it over the top of one of his\nshoes.\n“How is your wife?” Fell asked, taking the pipe from her mouth.\nAdamat hesitated. “She has… had a rough time of things.” That was as\nmuch of an understatement as Adamat had ever made. Faye had been\nbeaten and abused. She’d cried for two days straight and wouldn’t allow\nany of the children out of her sight for more than a few minutes. She grew\nfrom melancholy to cheerful and back again in seconds, but Adamat\nwouldn’t expect anything different from someone who’d been through what\nshe had. “She’s strong,” Adamat said. “She’ll be fine.”\nBo let his chair thump down onto four legs and stood up, stretching.\n“I’m happy to hear that.”\nStrangely enough, Bo sounded sincere. Privilegeds weren’t known for\ntheir empathy.\n“Hit me,” Bo said to Fell.\nA smile flickered across Fell’s face. She reached into her pocket and\nwithdrew a cashew, then tossed it in the air. Bo caught it in his mouth.\n“I need to get back to Ricard,” Fell said, gathering her bag of cashews\nand a leather satchel at her feet.\n“Go on,” Bo said. “We’ll take it from here. It was good working with\nyou this morning.”\nAdamat held up a hand. “A question.”\n“Yes?” Fell asked.\n“Did either of you see a young woman or a boy after we vacated Vetas’s\nmanor?”\n“The girl in the red dress?” Fell asked.\nThe one she’d let escape, along with Vetas, very nearly getting Faye\nkilled? “Yes. Her.”\nFell shook her head.\nBo hesitated a moment. “Maybe… no. No, I don’t think I saw them.”\n“Pity,” Adamat said. “Faye asked me to look for her. She was another\nprisoner of Vetas, and the boy may be a royal heir.”\n“I’ll put my ear to the ground,” Fell said. She gave them each a nod, her\nglance lingering on Bo, and then made her exit.\n“How was the ‘work’ this morning?” Adamat asked after Fell had left.\n“She’s very good at putting a man to the question,” Bo said, either"

He cracked his\nknuckles and headed down the long line of millstones. “Not as good as I\nam, but then, I am a cabal Privileged.” Bo glanced over his shoulder as if to\nbe sure Fell was gone, then said, “Don’t trust that woman.”\n“I wasn’t planning on it.”\n“Good. She’s loyal to Ricard and to her precious Academy. Nothing\nelse. And I’m not even sure if she’s more loyal to Ricard than she is to the\nAcademy.”\n“I imagine she’d say the same thing to me about you,” Adamat said.\n“Oh,” Bo said, “I don’t think you should trust me, either. But you only\nhave to deal with me for another couple of days. As soon as this Vetas\nbusiness is cleaned up and I think your family is safe, I’m in the wind.”\nBo led Adamat down the stairs at the end of the room and into the wheel\nroom beneath the mill. For each of the millstones above them, there was a\nwheel down here with one end dipped in the water. Or at least, there used to\nbe. Most of them were missing, leaving an empty channel of water flowing\nthrough one side of the floor.\nLord Vetas was strapped to an upright gurney in one corner. His arms\nwere missing—of course, Bo had taken those off two days ago. A bloody\nblanket covered his body; likely more for Adamat’s sake than for Vetas’s.\nHis eyes were closed, his breathing shallow.\nBo kicked the gurney and Vetas’s eyes shot open. He immediately tried\nto recoil from Bo, but his bonds kept that from happening.\n“You remember our friend Adamat?” Bo asked.\n“Yes,” Vetas whispered, not taking his eyes from Bo.\n“He has a few questions. Answer them.”\nAdamat centered himself before his former tormentor and tried to force\nhimself to remember what Vetas had done to his family. This pitiful creature\nbefore him didn’t deserve pity or compassion.\n“Where is my son?” Adamat asked.\n“I don’t know.”\n“What happened to him?”\n“Sold him.”\nAdamat rocked back on his heels. “Sold him? What do you mean?”\n“Slavers.”\n“There are no slavers in Adopest!”\nA hideous giggle wormed its way up through Vetas’s throat, only for\nhim to swallow it when Bo took a step forward. “Kez smugglers,” Vetas\nsaid, his voice still quiet. “Used to take powder mages out from under\nTamas’s nose and send them in to Kez.”\n“My boy is not a powder mage,” Adamat said.\nVetas blinked back at him. His eyes, once serpentine and unfeeling, were\nnow just… dead, was the only way to describe them. They showed fear\nwhen they glanced toward Bo, but other than that, nothing.\n“Why would you sell him to the Kez?”\n“My Privileged said he was a powder mage.”\nAdamat began to pace. Josep, a Marked? That seemed impossible. “How\nlong ago?”"

That seemed impossible. “How\nlong ago?”\n“A week.”\n“Have they taken him from the country?” Adamat felt his chest tighten\nas he began to panic. Smugglers dealing in human beings—especially\npowder mages—wouldn’t wait to get their cargo out of the country. In all\nlikelihood, Josep was gone already, far beyond Adamat’s reach.\n“I’d imagine,” Vetas said.\n“What do they want them for?” Adamat said. “The Kez don’t want\npowder mages alive. They’ve no need for smugglers. They use assassins.”\n“Experimentation,” Vetas said.\n“What do you mean?”\n“I don’t know. Just a guess.”\n“Where can I find them?”\nVetas looked away for a moment. Adamat stepped forward menacingly.\nThere was no fear in Vetas’s eyes. Not until Bo began to rub his thumb and\nforefinger together.\n“A pub near the waterfront,” Vetas said, his eyes twitching toward the\nwater flowing through the mill trough.\nA pub, eh? Probably not more than half a mile from this very place.\n“Tell me everything,” Adamat said.\nHe questioned Vetas for half an hour, getting the names of contacts,\nlocations, and passwords. He had to be thorough. Slavers in a place as\ncivilized as Adopest tended to operate in utmost secrecy, and would have\ntaken dozens of precautions.\nAdamat finished his questions and headed immediately toward the door.\nHe couldn’t get away from Vetas fast enough. The man revolted him. He’d\ntaken Adamat’s wife and children and put them through unspeakable trials.\nHe’d plotted against Adro, and he’d dealt with the lowliest of scum.\nBo jogged to catch up with Adamat as he climbed the stairs back to the\nmill’s main floor.\n“You didn’t ask him anything else,” Bo said.\n“I don’t need to know anything else.”\n“Claremonte’s plans? His designs on Adro? You don’t want to know all\nthat?”\nAdamat stopped and turned to the Privileged. “Later. I have to get my\nson back.”\n“It’s too late. If slavers have him, he’ll be out of the country by now.”\n“How would you know?” Adamat demanded.\n“Common sense,” Bo said. “And remember. The royal cabal was a dark\nplace. Dealing with slaves was one of many things they did.”\n“Bah!” Adamat strode toward the front of the mill.\nBo kept up, much to his annoyance. “We’ve been questioning Vetas for\ntwo days. Claremonte is planning something big. Not even Vetas knows it\nall, but Claremonte might even have plans of invasion!”\n“And I suppose you’re going to help stop him?”\nBo’s silence made Adamat sigh. The Privileged had no interest in\nhelping. He’d probably leave the country now that his debt to Adamat was\npaid. It seemed that Bo had just enough civic sense of duty to try to\nconvince Adamat to help stop Claremonte.\n“Even Vetas said that your son would be gone by now,” Bo said."

That’s awfully naïve for a cabal Privileged.”\nBo leaned in toward Adamat. “I broke him,” he said in words that were\nnearly a growl. “He wouldn’t dare lie to me.”\n“It was too easy,” Adamat said. “I know what type of man Vetas is. He’s\nkeeping something back.”\nDoubt flickered across Bo’s face, then resolved itself in a scowl. “No.\nHe won’t. He can’t. Like I said, I broke him.”\n“You should keep at it.” Adamat’s stomach twisted at the words. This\nkind of torture made him sick. Even when applied to Lord Vetas. “There’s\nno telling what else he has in that head of his.”\n“He’ll be dead within hours,” Bo said.\n“Ricard’s orders?” Perhaps Ricard thought Vetas was too much of a\nliability to keep alive for long. If Claremonte managed to find and rescue\nhim, the following wrath would be terrible indeed.\n“I don’t take orders from Ricard. No, nature will finish what I started.\nIt’s taken what little knowledge I have of healing to keep him alive. I tore\nhis arms off, and then spent the last two days questioning him. You think\nhe’ll live long? No. By nightfall I’m throwing his corpse into the Adsea and\ngetting the pit out of this country.”\n“Well, then.” Adamat took a deep breath and smoothed the front of his\ncoat. Here he was, back to square one. All his allies were gone. The\nProprietor had cut off contact. Ricard was busy dealing with the fallout of\nVetas’s capture, and Bo was leaving the country. Adamat was alone again.\n“I guess this is good-bye.”\nBo tugged at the fingers of his right glove and pulled it off. He extended\nhis hand. “Thank you.”\n“No,” Adamat said, clasping the hand. He felt his heart skip a beat.\nPrivileged did not shake hands with anyone. Not ever. “Thank you.”\nBo headed back toward the mill basement. Adamat watched him go,\nhoping that perhaps he’d change his mind and stay in the country. Maybe\nhe’d even help Adamat rescue Josep. But after a moment Bo disappeared\ndownstairs.\nAdamat headed into the street. This would be difficult. Maybe, just\nmaybe, he had one friend left in Adopest.\nAdamat paused on his doorstep and looked through the front window.\nThe blinds were drawn, but through the cracks he could see the twins\nplaying on the rug in the living room. One of them had a wooden boat. The\nother one wanted it, and pushed the first over, snatching for the toy.\nAdamat felt a smile tug at the corner of his mouth. They’d been through\nso much, but they still played and argued like regular children. He’d\nexpected them to be worse for the wear after their ordeals. Fanish, his oldest\ndaughter, shouted from the back room, and a moment later she entered and\nseparated the two, then berated them soundly."

Fanish, his oldest\ndaughter, shouted from the back room, and a moment later she entered and\nseparated the two, then berated them soundly.\nHe pushed the door open and stepped inside. It didn’t take long for all\nthe children to mob him as they all sought for a hug or a kiss. He knelt and\nlet them fawn over him. Felt the relief to have them back home. He never\nwould have thought he’d welcome the shouting and shoving after a long\nday of walking the street… but he finally had his family back.\nThe smile slid from his face. No sign of Faye.\n“Where’s your mother?” Adamat asked Fanish, gently prying Astrit off\nhis leg.\n“She’s in bed, Papa.”\n“Has she been down today?” Fanish looked at the younger children and\nshook her head. She was old enough to know her mother had been through\na lot, and to notice readily that she was acting strange. She was also smart\nenough to want to keep the other children from worrying.\nAdamat took his daughter aside. “Has she eaten?”\n“No.”\n“What did you have for dinner?”\n“Soup. It’s still over the fire.”\n“Where’d it come from?”\n“Ricard’s assistant brought it by. Enough for three days for the whole\nfamily.”\n“Fell?”\n“Her. Yes.”\nAdamat’s fists tightened. The woman who almost cost Adamat his wife\nby letting Vetas escape. He’d never forget that. He stopped himself from\ngetting worked up. This was no time to hold a grudge. “Get me a bowl of\nsoup.”\nHe set his cane next to the front door and hung up his hat, then took the\nsoup from his daughter and headed upstairs. In their bedroom, Faye was\nlying with her back to the door, blankets pulled up around her shoulders\neven though it was summer and the house was quite warm.\n“Faye,” he said gently.\nNo response.\nHe went around to her side of the bed and sat gently on the edge. He\ncould see the rise and fall of her shoulders as she breathed softly. Her eyes\nwere closed, but long intimacy told him she was still awake.\n“Love,” he said, “you need to eat something.”\nAgain, no response.\n“Sit up,” he said. “You need to eat.”\n“You didn’t take your boots off.” Her voice was quiet and timid. Not at\nall the scolding brashness that he was used to, and that worried him.\n“I’m sorry, I’ll sweep up. You need to eat now.”\n“I’m not hungry.”\n“You haven’t eaten all day.”\n“I did.”\n“I talked to Fanish.”\nShe was lying to him, and now she knew that he knew. “Oh.”\n“You have to keep up your strength.”\n“Why?” She pulled the blanket tighter around her shoulders.\n“For the children. For me. For yourself.”\nFaye didn’t say anything. Adamat could see tears rolling down her\ncheeks, her eyes squeezed closed. He put a hand gently on her arm. Didn’t\nshe know she was safe now? Couldn’t she tell that the children needed her\nmore than ever? That he needed her?\n“I’m going to find Josep,” he said."

I’ll be back\nlate tonight, though.”\nThere was a knock on the door downstairs, and Faye shifted around in\nthe bed, her movements jerking, her eyes wide and wild.\n“It’s just SouSmith,” Adamat said, trying to calm her. “He’s going with\nme.”\n“What is this lead? Where is my boy?” Faye demanded.\n“It’s nothing to—”\nShe grabbed him by the arm, her grip vice-like. “Tell me.”\nAdamat sank back onto the bed. He didn’t want to worry her, but it\nseemed it couldn’t be helped. “Vetas sold him to Kez slavers. Supposedly,\nJosep is a powder mage. I’m going to go meet with the slavers and try to get\nhim back.”\n“No,” Faye said, surprising Adamat with the force of the word. “You’ll\ndo no such thing. You’ve already scraped through so much danger. I’ll not\nwait here for word of your death.”\n“I’ve dealt with worse than slavers,” Adamat said.\n“I know the type of men Vetas did… business with.” Faye spat the word.\nThere was panic in her eyes. Adamat could see that her desire to get her son\nback was warring with the need to protect her husband and her remaining\nchildren.\n“I have to get Josep back. I won’t leave him to the Kez.”\nFaye squeezed his arm tighter. “Be careful.”\n“I will.” Adamat extricated himself from Faye’s grip as gently as he\ncould. Tears were streaming down her face as he left the room and headed\ndown the stairs. SouSmith stood in the front hall, coat buttoned tight,\nsmiling at the children playing in the living room.\nThe boxer nodded to Adamat. “Ready?”\n“Yes.” Adamat glanced up the stairs to his bedroom and took his cane\nfrom beside the door. “Fanish, check on your mother in a half hour or so.”\n“Yes, Papa.”\n“Good girl. SouSmith, let’s go.”\nCHAPTER\n28\nE\nverything OK?” SouSmith asked as they took a hackney cab away from\nAdamat’s home. The evening air was warm and windy. Adamat decided\nthere would be a storm tomorrow.\n“Fine,” Adamat said.\nSouSmith didn’t seem to believe him, cocking an eyebrow.\n“Fine!” Adamat said, louder.\nSouSmith nodded to himself and settled against the side of the hackney\ncab.\nAdamat looked out the window and watched the people going about\ntheir nightly errands. There was a small boy on the corner, trying to sell the\nlast of his newspapers, and an older couple out for a stroll before it turned\ndark.

Adamat\ncould see the beaten sign, rocking in the wind from its post. What a stupid\nname. The Adsea wasn’t salt water.\nHe checked the snub-nosed pistols in his pocket while SouSmith did the\nsame. The boxer frowned during their preperations, not looking at Adamat.\n“Sorry,” Adamat said when he was ready to go.\n“Eh?”\n“I didn’t mean to snap at you,” Adamat said. “You’re a good man. A\ngood friend, for coming with me to do this. It could be very dangerous.”\nSouSmith grunted. “You still paying me, ain’t you?”\n“Yes.”\nThe boxer nodded, as if it were a matter of course that he’d come with,\nbut his frown dissolved.\nThey headed toward the pub, and Adamat listened to the click of his\ncane on the cobbles, then on the wood as they entered the boardwalk. This\npub was out on the pier—a bad location. Only one exit, though no doubt\nsmugglers had a boat hidden underneath for a quick getaway.\nNot the ideal place to confront slavers.\nAdamat pushed the door open and was met with silence.\nA half-dozen sailors lounged around the dimly lit, one-room building.\nNot a mean-looking lot. Most of them were young men in their prime\nwearing white cotton shirts, open at the chest, and knee-length trousers.\nThey all blinked at Adamat as if he were a three-eyed fish.\nActing inconspicuous was out of the question.\nAdamat sidled up to the bar, while SouSmith leaned up against the door\nframe, taking in the sailors with his piggish eyes. Adamat slid a fifty-krana\nnote across the bar. “I’m looking for Doles,” he said.\nThe barkeep’s expression didn’t change. “I’m Doles. What’ll you have?”\n“Brudanian whiskey, if you have it,” he said.\nDoles, who was dressed like an ordinary sailor—and probably was—\ntook the banknote and stuffed it in his pocket. He reached beneath the bar,\nnot taking his eyes off Adamat, and brought up a decanter of dark liquid. He\nslammed it on the bar with enough force to make Adamat jump, then\npoured a shot into a small, dirty cup.\n“Bad season for it,” Doles said.\nThe script was just as Vetas had said. Adamat’s mouth was dry, and he\nhad to concentrate to keep his hand from shaking as he reached out and took\nthe glass of whiskey in one hand. “Never a bad season for Brudanian\nwhiskey,” he replied.\nAdamat had had a cudgel pulled on him enough times to know the signs.\nDole’s wrist twitched behind the bar. A moment later his hand came up,\ncocked back and swinging a piece of polished wood the length of a man’s\nforearm.\nAdamat drew his pistol with his left hand and raised his right to grab\nDoles’s wrist, arresting the swing of the cudgel.\n“I think we should settle down,” Adamat said, his pistol aimed at the\nbarkeep’s nose."

We should.”\nAdamat blanched. He felt the cold barrel of a pistol touch the back of his\nneck, and his hackles went up.\n“Drop it,” Doles said.\nAdamat rolled his tongue around his parched gums. His heart hammered\nin his ears. “I die, you die,” he said.\n“I’ll take the risk.” Doles didn’t seem concerned.\nThe pistol barrel pressed harder against the back of his neck. Adamat\nslowly lowered his own pistol and set it on the bar. Doles picked it up and\nunloaded it. “Kill them, dump the bodies out beyond the breakers.”\nAdamat felt rough hands grab him by the arms. He was pulled around to\nsee SouSmith receiving similar treatment. Three of the sailors held him,\nknives drawn to his throat, while two others manhandled Adamat down to\nhis knees.\n“Don’t do it here,” Doles said with some annoyance, gesturing to the\nsailors. “I don’t want blood on me floorboards. Do it downstairs.”\n“I’m here about a boy,” Adamat said as he was shoved toward one\ncorner of the room.\nDoles didn’t answer him.\n“Someone you smuggled into Kez,” Adamat said.\nA rug was pulled back to reveal a trapdoor. SouSmith began to struggle\nviolently, and one of the men holding Adamat joined the other three to\nwrestle SouSmith toward the corner.\n“Vetas is dead!” Adamat said.\nThe sailor stopped pushing him toward the trapdoor. Adamat jerked\naway from his grip and faced Doles, who was holding up one hand.\n“Dead? Really?”\n“Yes,” Adamat said. “We took him and his men, and Vetas is dead.”\nDoles sighed. “Damn it. We’ll have to move again.” He twitched his\nhead, and Adamat was grabbed and pushed. Adamat tried to struggle, but\nthe sailor was far stronger than he. His cane had been lost by the bar, and\nhis hat knocked off. He snagged a handful of the sailor’s hair and fought\nback.\nDoles walked around the bar and watched the struggle impassively.\n“Either up here or down there,” Doles said. “Don’t make no difference to\nme. ’Cept I’ll have to clean the blood up if you die here.” He paused. “Well,\nwe’re moving anyway. Guess it doesn’t matter.”\n“He’s my son!” Adamat said. “Please, I just want him back. Don’t you\nhave children?”\n“Nope,” Doles said, leaning against the bar. He seemed amused by the\nstruggle between SouSmith and his sailors.\n“A father? You had a father! Please!”\n“I did,” Doles said. “Bastard and a drunk. Woulda killed him myself had\nhe not fallen off a dock and drowned.”\nAdamat stepped back, and his foot touched air as he fell into the\ntrapdoor. He snagged one arm on the ladder leading down beneath the pier,\nand the other on the floor. A sailor stomped on his hand, and Adamat let out\na yell."

In cash!”\nDoles’s eyebrows climbed his forehead. “Well. Let up, boys.” He\nstepped forward and kicked the sailor still grinding his heel into Adamat’s\nfingers. “I said, let up!”\nThe sailor stepped away from Adamat, and the others ceased wrestling\nwith SouSmith. The moment they’d loosened their hold, SouSmith grabbed\none by the face and picked him off the floor, tossing him through the\nwindow. There was a strangled scream and a splash.\n“Let up!” Doles bellowed.\nSouSmith froze, a snarl on his face, the arm of a sailor grasped between\ntwo hands as if he was ready to snap a twig.\nDoles glanced out the broken window, then frowned at SouSmith. “A\nstrong bugger,” he muttered. Louder, “Three hundred thousand,” Doles\nsaid. “That’s the price for your boy.”\n“Three hundred…?”\n“Take it or leave it,” Doles said. “And by ‘leave it’ I mean we’ll kill you\nnow.”\nAdamat felt his mouth work soundlessly. Even with the money Bo had\ngiven him, he didn’t have three hundred thousand krana. He’d have to\nborrow from Ricard.\n“I’ll do it.”\nDoles seemed skeptical, but he spit in his hand and reached down.\nAdamat took the offered handshake and choked down a scream when Doles\ngripped his freshly crushed hand and squeezed. Doles lifted him out of the\nhole, stronger than Adamat would have expected.\n“What’s his name?” Doles asked.\n“Josep.”\n“Ah, I remember him. Stubborn lad.” Doles’s face soured. “He’s already\nin Norpoint.”\nNorpoint was the only Kez harbor on the Adsea, far to the south.\nAdamat felt his heart skip a beat. If Josep was already in Norpoint…\nDoles said, “It’ll take me about six days to go down and get him back.\nI’ll have to grease some palms. The Kez never like losing a powder mage\nthey thought they had under wraps,” Doles mused out loud, speaking for all\nthe world as if this was a business meeting, and he hadn’t just been about to\nhave Adamat killed.\n“Fifty thousand tomorrow,” Doles said. “Here, before sunup. Then two\nhundred and fifty when I get back from Norpoint.”\n“And then?”\n“We’ll meet at The Flaming Cuttlefish,” Doles said. “It’s a pub close\nby.”\n“I know it.”\n“Good.”\nAdamat nursed his crushed hand and hoped that none of the fingers were\nbroken. It would certainly be stiff in the morning.\n“How can I trust you?” he asked.\nDoles made an openhanded gesture. “You can’t. Want your boy back?”\n“Yes.”\n“Then this is your only chance.”\nAdamat examined the man. A slaver. Nothing respectable or trustworthy"

Nothing respectable or trustworthy\nabout him. He had an honest face, though Adamat found that honest faces\nwere almost always deceptive. “I’ll be back here in a few hours with the\nmoney.”\n“I’ll see you then,” Doles said. He gestured to the door. They were\ndismissed.\nThe sailor SouSmith had thrown through the window suddenly stuck his\nhead up through the trapdoor. His face was bloody from the glass, his\nclothes and hair soaked, silt on one shoulder. “I’ll kill you!” he screamed at\nSouSmith, hefting himself up through the trapdoor.\nDoles tripped the man on his mad dash toward SouSmith, then set a boot\non the sailor’s backside. He waved good-bye to Adamat, then said to his\nman, “Stay down, or I’ll let the big one tear you apart.”\nOutside, SouSmith turned a sneer toward the pub.\n“That could have gone better,” Adamat said. “Then again… it could\nhave gone worse.”\nSouSmith’s sneer slowly left his face. “Yeah. You need me to come back\nwith ya?”\n“Yes. Yes, I think that would be a good idea.”\n“I’ll be ready for ’em next time,” SouSmith said, and for a moment he\nlooked as if he considered going back in and killing the lot.\nAdamat looked the big man over. He didn’t seem worse for the wear.\nHis shirt had ripped. Not many people get the drop on SouSmith.\n“I’m sure,” Adamat said. “Let’s go get the money.”\nTaniel sat in a chair in the middle of the tent, his hands clasped in irons and\nhis legs shackled. There wasn’t an ounce of powder anywhere within fifty\nfeet of the command tent, and above all the cautions that the General Staff\nhad taken with his arrest, that concerned him the most. They were being\ncareful with him. Too damned careful.\nHe was flanked by a pair of provosts. Two more stood behind him, and\nanother four were at the back of the command tent. Each man held a\ntruncheon at the ready and was eyeing him like he was some kind of\ndangerous degenerate.\nThe tent was barren, austere. There were a dozen chairs in the back,\nmost of them empty, and at the front a table with five places—one for each\nof the senior General Staff of the Adran army.\nTaniel inspected the tent with a quick glance. Colonels Doravir and\nBertthur were seated just behind him. Bertthur’s broken jaw was held in\nplace by a linen tied around his head. To Taniel’s surprise, Brigadier Abrax,\nthe senior commander of the Wings of Adom, sat near the tent flap. What\ninterest could she have in these proceedings?\nIn the back corner, Colonel Etan sat in his wheeled chair, nodding\nencouragement. Taniel forced a confident smile he didn’t feel. No one else\nhad come to support him.\nThen again, perhaps they wouldn’t let anyone else in the tent.\nThis was, after all, a court-martial."

The provosts grasped Taniel roughly beneath the arms and\npulled him to his feet, the chains on his ankles nearly making him trip and\nfall.\nGenerals Ket and Hilanska were the only two Taniel recognized. He\nshould know more of the senior staff than this, shouldn’t he? Or had Ket\nstacked the cards against him by selecting new generals to serve on the\njury? Taniel tried to meet Hilanska’s eye, but the one-armed general kept\nhis gaze on the floor, a scowl on his face. This didn’t bode well.\nThe generals sat, and Taniel was allowed back in his chair. General Ket\ntook the middle seat, scratching furiously at the stub of her missing ear. Her\neyes traveled about the tent for a moment and then came to rest on Taniel.\nShe gave a slight shake of her head, like a prison warden denying parole.\n“This court-martial is in session,” Ket said. “I will be presiding. As you\nall know, this is a time of war. In such cases, Adran military law allows us\nto proceed with a drumhead court-martial. No prosecutor or defensive\ncouncil was consulted. An investigation was carried out swiftly and\nprivately over the course of the last seven days, and now, according to\nAdran military law, we will determine guilt and sentencing.”\nTaniel heard the tent flap at the back of the room part, and the sounds of\nthe camp outside grew momentarily louder before the flap was closed again.\nA frown passed over Ket’s face at what she saw. Taniel thought about\nturning around, but Ket was still speaking.\n“We’ve lost eight miles of ground and over three thousand men over the\nlast seven days due directly to the chaos caused by Captain Taniel and his\nproclamation that Field Marshal Tamas is still alive, and that the General\nStaff is in league with the enemy. Captain Taniel is accused of fomenting\nrebellion among the ranks. The charge: treason. Does the accused enter a\nplea?”\n“Not guilty,” Taniel said. He knew the customs of the court. This was\nstandard procedure—or at least, that’s what Colonel Etan had told him, and\nEtan had studied military law at the university. Taniel couldn’t help the\nfeeling, however, that everything was going to go against him.\nGeneral Ket went on to read another dozen charges, including\ninsubordination and assaulting a superior officer. Taniel responded with\n“not guilty” to every charge.\nThere was a clink of silverware behind him, and General Ket scowled.\nTaniel turned around to find Mihali passing out small plates to everyone\nsitting in the back—even to the provosts. Mihali came to the front with a\nstack of plates balanced on his arm and began to set them on the general’s\ntable.\n“Provosts,” Ket said, “remove this man.”\n“Oh, it’s just refreshments,” Mihali scolded, bringing a plate to Taniel.\n“Wine cake sprinkled with chocolate shavings and a touch of pepper"

There will be hot coffee outside after the court-martial.” His back\nto the generals, Mihali winked at Taniel.\nNone of the provosts had responded to Ket’s command. They were too\nbusy eating.\nTaniel couldn’t quite muster the strength to smile. He took a proffered\nslice of cake and tasted a bite, his chains clinking, and found it absolutely\nperfect. When everyone had finished, Mihali gathered the plates and\nretreated to the back of the tent.\nKet’s cake remained untouched. “The investigation has concluded and\nthe evidence has been presented to the judges, each of whom has made his\nor her own private determination. On the charge of treason, how do we\nfind?”\n“Guilty.”\n“Not guilty,” General Hilanska said.\nKet stared into Taniel’s eyes. “Guilty.”\n“Guilty.”\n“Guilty.”\nTaniel felt as if the bottom of his stomach had dropped out.\nKet went on. “By a majority, the defendant is found guilty of treason.\nThe court-martial has reached its verdict. The penalty for treason is death\nby firing squad.”\n“That won’t work on a powder mage,” Mihali said helpfully from\nsomewhere in the back.\n“Silence in the court!” Ket pounded her gavel on the table.\n“I’m not allowed to speak for myself?” Taniel demanded. “To address\nthese idiotic charges?”\nKet sneered. “Were you or were you not given a full briefing by Colonel\nEtan on how a wartime court-martial is carried out?”\n“I was.”\n“Then you’ll know that you are not permitted to speak. Another outburst\nlike that and I’ll have you removed.”\nTaniel bit his tongue. Removed from his own trial? This was a load of\nbuggery!\n“In the case of a powder mage,” Ket said, “the execution will be carried\nout by hanging.”\nGeneral Hilanska leaned over to Ket and whispered something in her\near. She nodded slowly. Ket took a deep breath, as if collecting herself.\n“I’ve been remiss by jumping to the inevitable conclusion of this court.\nThe judges will now retire in order to discuss the sentencing of the guilty\nparty. Court is in recess for one hour.” The generals stood.\n“May I speak to the court?”\nGeneral Ket paused, about to exit the back, and frowned past Taniel’s\nshoulder. “This is a military court. I do not know who you are, ma’am, but\ncivilians are not permitted.”\n“It will just take a moment. My name is Fell, undersecretary of the\nNoble Warriors of Labor and personal assistant to Ricard Tumblar. I am\nhere to speak on behalf of Mr. Tumblar.”\nTaniel turned in his seat. Fell stood at the back of the room. She wore a\ntan suit jacket and sharply pressed shirt and trousers, her hands tucked\ncasually into the pockets of her vest.\n“Absolutely not,” Ket said. “Provosts, remove this woman.”\nThe gendarmes had no qualms about heading toward Fell."

The provosts\npaused, unsure as to whether to remove Fell now that Ket was facing her\ndirectly.\n“Captain Taniel Two-Shot is a military hero on two continents,” Fell\nsaid. “You might eschew politics, but you will destroy popular opinion of\nthis war and of your command if the captain is executed.”\n“I don’t care for public opinion. Leave this court.”\n“General Ket,” Fell said emphatically, “if Taniel Two-Shot is executed,\nthe factories will shut down in protest. Replacement boots, uniforms,\nbuttons, musket kits, shirts, and hats will stop coming to the front. Hrusch\nAvenue will cease to produce rifles and muskets. The newspapers will make\nsure every single soul in Adopest knows that Taniel Two-Shot, hero of\nAdro, son of the supposedly late, and most definitely great Field Marshal\nTamas, has been executed on trumped-up charges.”\n“Are you threatening me, Miss…?”\n“Fell.”\n“Fell.” Ket rounded the table and crossed the room, gesturing to the\nprovosts. “Are you threatening this war effort?”\nFell put a hand to her chest in shock. “Me? Threaten you? By Kresimir,\nGeneral Ket, I would never think to threaten you. After all, I can see\nTaniel’s face right there, tenderized like a side of beef by your provosts. I\nwouldn’t want to end up like that. No, I am merely providing context for the\nconsequences of the decision of this court.”\n“Your master controls the unions. Therefore, you’re threatening me.”\n“No.” Fell waggled her finger like a parent scolding a child. “My master\nheads the unions. The unions have the power to strike, and Mr. Tumblar\ncannot stop them if they so desire. Do you want that to happen?”\nKet leaned in toward Fell. To her credit, the undersecretary did not so\nmuch as flinch.\n“This court is in recess for one hour!” Ket whirled and stormed out of\nthe tent, followed by the other generals.\nFell dragged a chair up to the middle of the room. She waved her hand at\nthe provosts flanking Taniel, and they hesitantly took a step back. Fell\ndeposited the chair beside Taniel and sat down.\nTaniel studied Fell for a moment. She was dressed sharply, looking far\nmore a businesswoman than an undersecretary or personal assistant. Her\neyes, though, were tired, and Taniel could see a recent scar on her cheek\ncovered by a layer of face powder. She reached into her pocket and\nremoved a brown bag. “Cashew?”\nTaniel didn’t know what to make of the woman. She, and her master,\ncould have very well just saved Taniel’s life… but a man like Ricard always\nhad his price."

She, and her master,\ncould have very well just saved Taniel’s life… but a man like Ricard always\nhad his price.\n“You’re going to owe Ricard a great deal if you live through this,” Fell\nsaid in a low voice.\nAnd there it was. “I didn’t ask for his help.”\n“No, but he gave it. You’re an honorable man, aren’t you, Taniel?”\nThe idea of owing Ricard Tumblar anything made Taniel’s stomach turn.\n“What’s Ricard’s price?”\n“Three years,” Fell said. “As a politician. You’ll be expected to attend\ngalas and address the public. Everything will be scheduled for you. When\nyou’re not in the public eye, you can do anything you want—bed\nwhomever, smoke all the mala in the world. Not a hard life at all.” Fell\nshrugged. “But if Ricard happens to die or be killed, you’ll have to step up\nas prime minister of Adro.”\n“I don’t want that.”\nFell gave him a tight smile. “Then you’re more qualified for the job than\nRicard is.”\nTaniel wondered if that was something that Ricard himself would have\nsaid, or if the undersecretary had just made a jab at her master.\n“I thought that Hrusch Avenue hadn’t unionized.” Taniel glanced\nmeaningfully toward the tent flap where the generals had exited.\n“They don’t know that.”\n“Is Ricard serious about those threats?”\n“I’d rather not find out.”\nA bluff, then. Taniel had to give credit to Ricard. Bluffing the senior\nstaff of the Adran army took courage. “Has Ricard ever tried blackmailing\nTamas?”\n“Oh, pit no. Tamas would have strung Ricard up like a marionette.”\n“I’m glad to hear he has limits.”\nThe hour-long recess for the court stretched into two hours, and then\ninto three. Mihali served coffee and another round of cake.\nTaniel couldn’t help wondering where the pit the generals had gotten to.\nWhat could be taking them so long?\n“This is a good thing, you know,” Fell said between bites of cake.\nColonel Etan, his chair wheeled up beside Taniel, agreed. “At this point,\nthe sentencing requires a four-out-of-five vote. If they’d returned at the\nhour, or earlier, it would not have looked good for you. They’ve been\narguing this whole time, which means that more generals than just General\nHilanska are trying to save your skin.”\nThe tent flap was swept aside, and the generals reentered the room. Fell\nand Etan both retreated to the back, and the generals took their chairs.\nKet examined Taniel for several moments before speaking. The anger\nhad left her eyes. Steely determination replaced it. “This court,” she said,\n“has found the defendant guilty of treason. We have decided to drop the\nremainder of the charges and commute upon the guilty one sentence, to be\ncarried out immediately:\n“Captain Taniel is hereby stripped of his rank in the Adran army and\ndishonorably discharged.

Any failure to do so will be met with swift reprisal. Court is\nadjourned.”\nTaniel could hear Doravir protesting from the back that the sentence was\ntoo light. Etan loudly argued that the sentence was too harsh. The provosts\nreleased Taniel from the irons and stripped him out of his uniform jacket.\nHe didn’t argue. He couldn’t argue. He barely noticed when the generals\nhad left.\nHow could they do this to him? After all he’d done? All he’d given?\n“Taniel.”\nHe looked up. Etan sat in front of him, an orderly waiting to wheel him\noff.\n“Taniel, you know I don’t believe any of this treason garbage. None of\nthem do either. If they did, they’d have executed you, regardless of\nTumblar’s threats. They just wanted you out of the way. If there’s anything\nyou need, just let me know. I have a house in North Umpshire if you need\nsomeplace quiet to recover. Bring the girl if you’d like.”\nKa-poel. Taniel let out a shaky sigh. What should he do with Ka-poel?\nSend her back to Fatrasta? Would she even go?\n“Thanks,” Taniel said.\nIt was some time before he realized that the tent was empty. Fell was\ngone. It occurred to him that he should have asked her if Ricard received his\nletter regarding the missing gunpowder.\nTaniel managed to climb to his feet. His legs shook, and he wondered\nwhere he could get some mala. No. Not mala. He needed powder. That\nwould be easier to find anyway. He had to gather his things. What did he\neven have? His sketchbook and charcoals. The rifle wasn’t even his—army\nissued, though he might be able to slip off with it anyway. He could sell the\nbuttons off his army jacket.\nTaniel cursed. The provosts had taken his jacket.\nHe cursed again when he noticed the tent was not, in fact, empty.\nMihali sat at the back, sipping a cup of coffee. He met Taniel’s glance\nwith the slight rise of his eyebrows.\nTaniel wondered what it would be like to punch a god. “Did you see\nthat, you bastard?” Taniel said. “ ‘Apologize to Doravir.’ That’s what you\ntold me. ‘Save the war.’ How the pit does this save anything? Stripped of\neverything I know?”\n“The future is always changing,” Mihali said. “Coffee?”\n“Go to the pit.”\nTaniel left the command tent and headed toward his quarters. He wasn’t\ntwo dozen steps outside when he was joined by Brigadier Abrax. It only\ntook him a few moments to realize why she was there.\n“Do the Wings of Adom usually perch at a court-martial, waiting to\nrecruit new mercenaries?”\nBrigadier Abrax was a serious woman in her forties, with short blond\nhair and a sharp white-and-red uniform. “Awfully full of yourself, Two-"

I can see why Ket wanted to be rid of you. What makes you think I’ve\ncome along recruiting?”\n“Nothing. Sorry, ma’am.” Taniel reminded himself that he was not in a\nposition to insult the senior commander of the best mercenary army in the\nworld.\n“I have, of course,” Abrax said. “Come recruiting, that is. I want to offer\nyou a spot in the Wings of Adom.”\nTaniel had never thought highly of mercenaries. At best, they took your\nmoney and did everything they could to avoid actually fighting. However,\nhe had to grudgingly admit that the Wings had a reputation for slogging into\nthe melee along with the ordinary infantry. He’d seen them do it himself\nduring this war.\nTaniel stopped and turned to the brigadier. “The General Staff would be\nfurious.”\n“What do I care?” Abrax said. “I don’t report to anyone but Lady\nWinceslav and Tamas. Not to the General Staff. Besides, I just watched\nthem court-martial their best soldier. I don’t have a lot of faith in their\nability to do anything right. Even if you are a pompous ass with no respect\nfor authority, you’re worth fifty men, and I mean to see you in my army.”\n“That was an incredibly backhanded compliment,” Taniel said.\nAbrax gave him a shallow smile. “I meant every word.”\n“Ricard Tumblar seems to think he’s bought me.”\n“If you feel as if you must repay him,” Abrax said with a shrug, “feel\nfree to do so. But after this war is over. I have the feeling you would much\nrather be on the front than in Adopest trying to win over the snakes in\npolitics. At least here you’re allowed to shoot your enemies.”\nTaniel looked around the camp. It was muddy and chaotic, the moans of\nthe wounded rising from the field hospitals and the crack of gunfire drifting\nback from the front. Still, he couldn’t imagine leaving it for a desk or a\npodium in Adopest.\n“What do you propose?” he asked.\n“You’ll be a major in the Wings of Adom with full pay and benefits. I’ll\nplace you outside the chain of command and you’ll only report to me. Your\nsole mission will be to kill enemy Privileged and Wardens. I don’t like to\ncomplicate things further than that.”\n“And the other brigadiers will agree to this?”\n“They love the idea,” Abrax said. She leaned toward him. “Tamas\nrecently stole one of our very best. He did it fairly, I think, but it still stung.\nThe brigadiers consider this revenge.”\nTaniel examined Abrax. She seemed sincere. Tamas had had nothing but\ngood things to say about the Wings, and being in a mercenary company was\ncertainly preferable to having to sit out the rest of the war.\n“Who did Tamas steal?”\n“A young brigadier by the name of Sabastenien,” Abrax said.\nThe name rang a bell, but Taniel could not give it a face.\n“How long do you want me in the Wings?”"

You’ll be\npaid in full and disbanded, with the option to muster for our next\nassignment.”\n“Ka-poel?”\nAbrax frowned. “Your savage?”\n“Yes.”\n“Bring her with if you want. I don’t care who you’re bedding. I put on a\ngood front, but I’m not a prude.”\n“I’m not sleeping with her. She accompanies me on the battlefield as my\nspotter.”\nAbrax seemed to mull this over for a few moments. “I can’t promise any\nmore than a private’s wages for her.”\n“Oh, ah…” Taniel almost stepped back. No one had even considered\nactually paying Ka-poel in the Adran army. “That sounds fair.”\n“We have a deal?”\n“I think so.”\n“Report to our camp in two hours,” she said. “We’ll get you bedded\ndown in temporary quarters and then outfit you in the morning. I want you\non the field killing Kez by noon tomorrow.”\nCHAPTER\n29\nT\namas climbed from his bedroll. He paused once, taking a deep breath.\n“Getting old,” he muttered.\nEvery morning his limbs ached a little more, especially his leg. Every\nday it took him just another couple of seconds to climb from the bed. Worse\nnow, sleeping on the hard ground. Every night for the last five weeks.\nFive weeks. Hard to believe it had only been that long since he’d faced\nthe Kez Grand Army, planning how he’d take them from the side and smash\nthem against the gates of Budwiel. Bloody stupid, now that he looked back\non it, thinking he could take the entire Grand Army with two brigades.\nHis arrogance got him into this. Had he been there, manning the walls\nbeside Hilanska and the rest, they would have fought off those Wardens and\nsent the Kez army to the pit.\nTamas got to his feet. He pulled on his shirt, long since yellowed and\nstained with blood—his own blood, and that of others—then on came his\nuniform pants and boots. Olem had polished the boots during the night, like\nhe did every night. He understood that a field marshal needed to keep up\nappearances. Finally, Tamas put on his jacket, and he stepped out into the\nmorning air with his bicorne tucked under one arm.\nGavril stared down at him from on horseback. Somehow, he kept that\nWatchmaster’s vest of his immaculate. His pants were ripped and stained,\nhis arms and shoulders covered with powder burns, nicks, and cuts, but the\nfaded colors of the Watchmaster’s vest showed no wear but that of time and\nwashing.\nGavril had Tamas’s charger saddled and ready, and held the reins out to\nTamas.\n“I’m not going on some bloody jaunt with you,” Tamas said.\n“Then why are you dressed?” Gavril looked around the camp.

Why did Gavril need this? Why did he need to drag\nTamas along with him? The dead were best left buried, undisturbed. They\ncared not for the sentiments of the living.\nTamas would rather have tipped his hat to the west and bowed his head\nin respect for a few minutes. It would have been more practical.\n“Get on your damn horse,” Gavril said.\nTamas climbed onto his mount.\nThey rode west in silence along one of the many rivers that made up the\nFingers of Kresimir. Tamas didn’t know if this one had a name. The locals\nprobably called it something—not that there were many locals in this part of\nKez.\nNorthern Kez, with its countless farms and ranches, had once been filled\nwith people. The alternating droughts and floods of the last ten years that\nhad caused Adro so many problems had also affected Kez, and huge\nportions of the Kez population had gone to the eastern cities in search of\nwork. He imagined those cities even more crowded and dirty than Adopest.\nTamas wondered how Adopest had fared in the war. The canal over the\nmountains should be finished by this time, alleviating some of the strain off\nthe Mountainwatch for trade. With war with the Kez, food would have to\ncome from Novi and Deliv.\nTamas and Gavril came down out of the highest foothills to where\nKresimir’s Fingers began to meet. The Fingers didn’t all converge, not all at\nonce. It was several days’ ride to the place where they did, and their\ndestination was not that far out onto the plains.\nThe ground turned rocky—great boulders and sudden ravines that made\nTamas wonder if the mountains had once come out this far, and if so, what\ngod or force of nature had knocked them down.\nThe terrain had provided a good place to hide from Ipille’s Wardens,\nlong ago.\nThey crossed a rocky bluff and then descended into a gully where two of\nKresimir’s Fingers met. Tamas rubbed at his shoulders, suddenly cold\ndespite the summer sun beating down upon them.\nHe saw it then. A cairn, not more than fifty paces from where the two\nrivers met. It was about four feet high and six feet across, sandstone rocks\ngathered from the area and stacked.\nIt had changed little in the last thirteen years. The bloody fingerprints\nboth Tamas and Gavril had left, their hands raw from digging the stony\nearth, had been washed away. A necklace—a treasured possession of the\ndead that Tamas had left on the highest stone—was gone, but the rest of the\ncairn remained undisturbed.\nTamas climbed down from his horse and tied the reins to a stunted tree.\nHe approached the cairn slowly. Thoughtfully. Now that he was here, the\ndread he’d felt in coming seemed silly."

Now that he was here, the\ndread he’d felt in coming seemed silly.\nHe turned to Gavril.\nThe big man, with all his stubbornness in making Tamas accompany him\non this pilgrimage, seemed reluctant to get any closer.\nTamas took a shaky breath. He reached out and touched the top stone of\nthe cairn.\n“Camenir,” he said, and found it felt good to say it aloud.\nA crunch of footsteps sounded on the rocky soil as Gavril finally joined\nhim.\n“I doubt anyone but you or me remember the name.” In his head, it had\nbeen a musing thought. Aloud, it sounded callous, and Tamas instantly\nregretted saying it. Gavril was the last of Camenir’s kin. His relatives on the\nKez side, dead by Ipille’s orders. The ones on the Adran side not numerous,\nand those alive having long disowned him.\nTamas tried to picture Camenir in his mind, and found he could not. He\nlooked a lot like Gavril, he thought. Not as big. Quite a bit younger. A\nsloppy, casual manner and a genuine smile that most found endearing.\n“How did you do it?” Gavril stood beside the cairn, head bowed.\n“Do what?”\n“How did you go on? After what happened?”\nTamas was surprised to hear accusation in Gavril’s voice.\n“What choice did I have?”\nWhat did Gavril want him to say? Did Gavril want him to admit he’d\nslept his way through half the eligible ladies in Adopest, and quite a few\nineligible ones? Did Gavril want him to point out that he’d killed more men\nin duels in the short time following Erika’s death than he had in all his\nangry youth?\n“I saw grief in you,” Gavril said. “I saw it eating through you after\nErika’s murder. After Manhouch denied your demands that we go to war.\nWhen you came and said you wanted to kill Ipille, I knew it had to be done.\nBut… but after we failed, after Camenir died, you changed. All those signs\nof grief I’d seen in you were gone. You went back to society. Smiled at all\nthose fools who’d laughed behind their hands at the box containing Erika’s\nhead. You entertained guests and walked the streets laughing.”\n“What choice did I have?” Tamas repeated.\nGavril gripped his shoulder and turned him around to look him in the\neye. “You never grieved for Camenir. You never cared that my little brother\ndied.” Tears sprang up in Gavril’s eyes, his face red.\n“What did you want?” Tamas was suddenly angry. Had Gavril held this\nagainst him all these years? Did Gavril think that Camenir meant nothing to\nhim? “Did you want me to turn to the bottle, like you did?”\n“I wanted you to show some decorum!” Gavril’s voice rose sharply.\n“Show some regret. Any sign of emotion for my brother! A man who died\nfor you!”"

A man who died\nfor you!”\nThis close, Gavril towered over him, but Tamas felt no fear. Only rage\nand regret. “That’s rich, coming from you,” Tamas spat. “Do you think\nclimbing into an ale cask showed decorum?”\nTamas barely saw the fist coming. One moment it loomed, big as a ham,\nand the next his ears rang as he stared at the ground from his knees. He\nblinked away a sudden haze. Blood leaked from his mouth and nose,\nspattering on the dusty ground. Not the first blood he’d left on this spot.\nHe climbed to his feet, wobbling on his knees. Gavril glared at him,\ndaring him to hit back.\nSo he did.\nThe look of surprise on Gavril’s face as Tamas’s fist connected with his\nstomach gave Tamas a jolt of satisfaction. He followed it up with another\npunch, doubling Gavril over.\n“I lost my wife, you bastard,” he growled.\nGavril wrapped his arms around Tamas and lifted him with a bellow.\nTamas felt a thrill of fear as his feet left the ground. To a man with Gavril’s\nstrength, he might as well have been a child.\nHe brought his elbow down on Gavril’s back, eliciting a yell from the\nbig man.\nGavril lifted him high, then pounded him into the ground. Tamas felt the\nair leave his lungs, the feeling leave his legs, and his vision blurred. He\nhacked out a cough and dug one hand into the fat of Gavril’s stomach.\nThey rolled in the dirt for what felt like hours. Swearing, kicking,\npunching. It didn’t matter how hard Tamas hit Gavril, nothing seemed to\nstop him. Even without a powder trance, Tamas still considered himself a\npit of a fighter. Gavril broke his holds. Absorbed his punches. And he gave\nas good—or better—than he got.\nTamas climbed to his feet and kicked Gavril. His brother-in-law shoved\nhim backward, and Tamas felt his back hit the rocks of the cairn.\n“Stop!” he said.\nGavril looked up, his face bruised, one eye blackened and his nose\nbloody. He saw the cairn behind Tamas and lowered his fist.\nTamas limped away from the cairn and lowered himself against an old\nfallen log.\nHe felt along his ribs. One of them might have gotten cracked. His face\nfelt like a rug after the housekeeper had beat it for an hour. The back of his\njacket had ripped—he could tell just by moving his shoulders. One of his\nboots was on the other side of the cairn, and Tamas didn’t even remember it\ncoming off.\n“You want to know what happened to me?” Tamas said.\nGavril grunted. He lay on the ground across from Tamas, legs splayed.\n“That night we buried Camenir is the night I decided to kill Manhouch.”\nTamas gathered up a wad of spit and hawked it into the dirt.

Not for the people’s rights or because Manhouch was\nevil or any of the other drivel I tell my supporters. I started a war to avenge\nmy wife and my brother.”\nTamas took a deep breath and stared at his stockinged foot. His sock had\nripped a week ago and his big toe stuck through it. “I couldn’t do it in a\nworld of grief. I had to feel out my friends. Charm my enemies. That was\nthe first step: to convince them I was still Adro’s favored son. Manhouch’s\nprotector. The next step was putting Manhouch’s head in a basket.\n“Then, of course, the war. Which”—Tamas held up one finger—“I\nalmost didn’t go through with. The earthquake and the royalists nearly\nknocked me off my course. My heart bled when I saw the shambles in\nwhich Adopest had been left. But Ipille sent Nikslaus and put me back on\nmy path to vengeance.”\nTamas let his finger drop. “The path will end when I cut out Ipille’s\nheart for taking my family.”\nThe air was still. The only sound that of the water where the two rivers\nmet.\n“That was a nice speech,” Gavril said.\n“I thought so.”\n“Had that memorized long?”\n“Most of it for years,” Tamas said. “Had to do a little improvising.\nNever thought I’d be giving it to you.”\n“Who, then?”\nTamas shrugged. “My grandchildren? My executioner? Taniel’s the only\none who knew the real reasons I planned the things I did.”\nThe sound of a horse whinnying brought Tamas’s head around. Up on\nthe bluff, perhaps a hundred feet away, were two riders. He squinted into\nthe afternoon sun as his fingers looked for his pistol. It had come out of his\nbelt and lay a dozen paces to his left.\nThe riders began to head down the bluff toward him. The glare of the\nsun lessened, and he recognized two familiar faces: Olem and Beon je\nIpille.\n“Company,” Tamas said.\nGavril craned his neck and looked toward the bluff. “Is that Beon and\nOlem?”\n“Yes.”\n“I could break Beon’s neck. Bury him next to Camenir. Would be poetic\njustice in that.”\n“My—our—quarrel isn’t with Beon. It’s with his father.”\n“I’ve heard Beon is Ipille’s favorite.”\n“Ipille’s ‘favorite’ son changes every six months or so. Beon just lost a\nmajor battle with me. I think if we killed him now, Ipille would say he\ndeserved it.”\n“Not a loving father.”\n“No.”\nOlem and Beon came to a halt some dozen paces off. Olem looked down\nat Tamas’s dislodged boot, then around the gully. “Seems there was a fight,”\nhe said.\n“Ambushed. We dumped the bodies in the river,” Tamas said.\n“Of course,” Olem said. He didn’t sound convinced."

He didn’t sound convinced.\n“I thought that you were given orders to stay in the camp?” Tamas said\nto Olem.\n“Sorry, sir,” Olem said. “The general here asked me to accompany him\nas his chaperone so that he did not break his word of honor in leaving the\ncamp.”\n“And why did you feel the need to follow me?” Tamas turned to Beon.\nBeon frowned toward the cairn. “I have heard a story,” he said.\n“Regarding a powder mage, and two huge brothers with great strength.” His\neyes flicked to Gavril. “An old story, passed around in my father’s court.\nOne that my father has taken great pains to stamp out.”\n“So?” Gavril said, his tone petulant.\nBeon seemed unperturbed. “The story caught my childhood imagination.\nIt comes to an end when an entire company of my father’s Elite disappeared\nin the Fingers of Kresimir. Some of their bodies were found. Some weren’t.\nI always wondered if that was really the end of the story.”\nTamas and Gavril looked at each other.\nTamas asked, “And you thought you might find the end of the story by\nfollowing us out here?”\nBeon was looking at the cairn again. “I thought, perhaps. I see a powder\nmage, a widower by my father’s orders, and one very large man with great\nstrength. I predict that the story I heard has a sadder ending than my\nchildhood imagination would have hoped.” He bowed his head toward them\nand turned his horse around. “I’m sorry to have disturbed you.”\n“It did,” Gavril called out.\nBeon stopped and looked back. “Did what?”\n“The story. It had a sad ending.”\n“No,” Beon said. “The story is not over yet. But the ending will be very\nsad regardless.”\nCHAPTER\n30\nT\nhe Flaming Cuttlefish was a fisherman’s pub. Like The Salty Maiden, it\nwas located out at the end of a pier, suspended about ten feet above the\nwater. Unlike The Salty Maiden, it was packed with all kinds. There were\nfactory workers, seamstresses, millers, and even a few gunsmiths. The pub\nwas known throughout the city for cheap, delicious freshwater oysters. In\none corner of the room a fiddler was sawing away a seaman’s tune, and the\nwhole pier swayed with the stamp of a hundred feet.\nThe barmaid had assured Adamat that that was normal.\nAdamat nursed his beer and let his eyes wander around the room again.\nHe sat with his back to the wall, watching the exits. No signs of the slaver,\nDoles, or any of his men. No sign of Adamat’s son.\nIt was near midnight. Doles was supposed to meet him here yesterday,\nbut had never come. Riding out his optimism, Adamat had come back and\nwaited all day, a case filled with two hundred fifty thousand krana in cash\nsitting on his knee.

He was drumming his\nfingers to the tune of the fiddler, his eyes wandering. Adamat could tell he\nwas losing focus.\n“Pit!” Adamat swore, getting to his feet.\nSouSmith started. “Huh?” He came alert, looking around for signs of\ndanger.\n“He’s not coming,” Adamat shouted above the music and stamping.\n“We’re done here.”\nSouSmith followed him out into the night, and for the second time in a\nweek Adamat found himself standing in the dark, on a pier, with nothing to\nshow for himself. He kicked a pier piling and swore when it bruised his toe.\nHe nearly threw his case into the water, but SouSmith grabbed his arm.\n“You’ll be sorry ’bout that.”\nAdamat looked down at the case. All of his money; his savings, the\nmoney Bo had given him, plus another fifty thousand from Ricard. Yes. He\nwould have been sorry.\n“I’ll have to go to Norport now,” Adamat said. He was already doing the\nmath in his head. He’d have to charter a boat—and not just any boat, but a\nsmuggler to get him into the Kez-held town—then he’d need to locate Josep\nand free him from the Kez. There might be Privileged involved, though\nrumor had it Taniel Two-Shot had killed most of the Kez Cabal on South\nPike. Then he’d…\nSouSmith shook him by the arm.\n“What is it?” Adamat asked, annoyed that his thoughts had been\ninterrupted.\n“Norport? You mad?”\n“No. I have to get my son back.”\nSouSmith sighed. He pulled a pipe from his pocket and set it between\nhis teeth, then packed it with tobacco. “Have to let it go,” he grunted.\n“He’s my boy,” Adamat said. “How can I let him go?” He slumped\nagainst the same pier piling that he’d just kicked.\n“He’s outta reach,” SouSmith said gently.\n“No. He can’t be.” Adamat tried to resume his previous train of thought.\nSo much he’d have to do. “Will you come with me?”\nSouSmith puffed on his pipe for a moment. “Yeah.”\n“Thank you,” Adamat said, relief washing over him. Norport would be\ndangerous, but going alone into Kez territory might be suicide.\n“One condition.”\n“What’s that?”\n“Sleep on it.”\nAdamat hesitated for a moment. He should prepare tonight. Get his\nsupplies together, find a smuggler… then again, finding a smuggler would\nbe far easier in the morning. Most of Adamat’s contacts were asleep by this\nhour. “Fine,” he said. “I’ll sleep on it.”\nSouSmith accompanied Adamat home before taking his own leave.\nAdamat watched SouSmith’s hackney cab clatter down the street, then\nheaded inside.\nThe house was quiet but for the soft sound of one of the children crying.\nAdamat removed his boots and hat, and hung his jacket by the door.

Fanish sung softly to her, holding her tight and rocking her back\nand forth. Neither of them saw Adamat.\nHe crept into his own room. The lamp was burning low, like it always\nwas when Adamat was still out late.\nFaye sat up in bed. Her eyes were red, her long, bedraggled curls\nframing her haggard face. The faint light of hope in her eyes died when she\nsaw him, and Adamat felt his shoulders slump in defeat. He sat down on the\nbed beside her and buried his face in his hands.\n“You tried,” Faye said. She was better, he thought. Despite her\nappearance, she’d been growing stronger over the last week, spending time\nwith the children. She still stayed away from the windows and avoided\ngoing outside, though Adamat couldn’t determine the reason. Perhaps she\nfeared being seen by one of her former captors?\n“I’m going to Norport,” Adamat said when he’d regained his\ncomposure.\nFaye’s hand, gently stroking his arm, froze. “Why?”\n“To get Josep back. I can find him there, and if I can’t find him, I can\npick up his trail.”\n“No.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I mean no.” Faye’s tone was firm. “I’ll not have you risking your life\nover this. Not anymore. I’ve lost Josep, but I have eight more children, and\nI can’t provide for them and protect them without you.”\n“You won’t—”\n“I said no.”\nAdamat could tell by her tone there’d be no argument. No hope at all.\nShe’d do everything in her power to keep him from going. “But—”\n“No.”\nHe tried to find the courage to tell her off. To tell her that he had a duty\nto his son, that he could still get his boy back.\nThe courage never came.\nIn the morning, Adamat went to return the money he’d borrowed from\nRicard.\nA secretary met him in the lobby of Ricard’s new headquarters. She\nopened her mouth with a word of greeting, but something on his face must\nhave stilled her tongue, and she led him back to the room off the side of the\nbuilding that was Ricard’s office.\nThe room was much larger than his old office, but no cleaner.\nThe whole room reeked. There were oysters on one shelf, probably from\nthe same pub that Adamat had been to last night, and from the smell of\nthem they were three days old. The scent was made worse by some kind of\nincense burning on Ricard’s desk.\nHe ignored Ricard’s greeting and threw himself into the chair across\nfrom him.\nRicard frowned and leaned back in his seat, and the two of them\nregarded each other for a few moments. Ricard’s eyes went to the case on\nAdamat’s lap.\n“They never showed,” Adamat said, tossing the case on the ground.\n“They took my fifty-thousand-krana deposit and disappeared. Now my boy\nis gone forever, along with any hope I have of getting him back. I should\nnever have trusted them.” Adamat could hear the disgust in his own voice."

I should\nnever have trusted them.” Adamat could hear the disgust in his own voice.\nRicard got that look on his face when he was about to say “I told you\nso,” but instead quietly said, “We all make mistakes.”\nAdamat wanted to break things. He wanted to go on a violent rampage,\ndestroying Ricard’s expensive furniture and chandeliers and crystal\ndecanters, then throw himself on the ground in the middle of the mess and\nsob.\n“I don’t know what to do now,” he said.\nRicard said, “I have something I could have you look into.”\nAdamat fixed Ricard with a long look. How could Ricard think he’d\nwant to take a case right now?\n“It would keep your mind off things,” Ricard went on. “There are\naccusations of profiteering within the ranks of the Adran army. I need to\nfollow up on those accusations and find some evidence.”\n“That’s a job for the provosts,” Adamat said.\n“Not when the corruption runs all the way up to the General Staff.”\n“No,” Adamat said. “I’m done with military dealings. Find someone\nbraver and stupider.”\nRicard stifled a smile. “You’re the bravest and stupidest man I know.”\n“I can attest to that,” a voice said from the back of the room.\nPrivileged Borbador stood in the doorway. He wore a slimming day\njacket, his face pink from a morning shave, a cane in one hand. His\nPrivileged’s gloves were nowhere to be seen.\n“Who the pit are you?” Ricard asked.\n“Privileged Borbador, at your service.” Bo bowed his head slightly. “I\nunderstand you have a letter for me.”\n“Oh,” Ricard said in surprise. A confused look crossed his face. “How\ncould you possibly know that I have a letter for you?”\nBo smiled.\n“Right. From Taniel Two-Shot,” Ricard said. He searched through his\npapers until he discovered the letter, then brought it to Bo.\nBo leaned up against the doorway as he read the note. He turned it\naround, looking at some kind of report that had been written on the back.\nHis eyes narrowed, and he glanced at Adamat. “Did you tell him that Tamas\nis still alive?”\n“I did,” Adamat said.\n“We have no evidence of that.” Ricard spread his hands.\n“He is,” Bo said. “And when he gets back, he’s going to gut his General\nStaff.”\n“If the army runs out of powder, Adro will have been conquered long\nbefore Tamas returns.”\nBo chewed on his lip. “Any word from Taniel Two-Shot? Other than this\nletter, I mean.”\n“He is being court-martialed as we speak. I sent my undersecretary\ndown to intervene on my behalf, but I won’t know the results for days.”\n“Court-martialed? For what?” Bo’s tone was flat.

But Taniel suspects that some of the\nGeneral Staff are war-profiteering, and may even be in league with the Kez,\nwhich would explain why they’re court-martialing their only powder\nmage.”\nBo waved the letter. “Yes, I read that. Pit. Pit, pit, pit. I suppose I could\ngo kill them all, if they haven’t hanged him by the time I get there.”\n“That wouldn’t be very good for the war effort,” Adamat pointed out.\n“And we don’t know which of the generals are profiteering.”\n“You think I give a damn about who it is?” Bo snapped. Bo raised his\nhand, and even though he wasn’t wearing his Privileged’s gloves, Adamat\nfelt himself shrink into his chair. Bo took a deep breath and closed his eyes\nfor a few minutes before speaking again. “I’ll take care of this,” he said. To\nRicard, “I may need your help.”\n“My organization is at your disposal.”\n“Good.”\nBo left as quickly as he’d arrived, and Adamat found himself alone with\nRicard once again.\n“Well, that’s interesting. You’ve made yourself some rather fascinating\nfriends.” Ricard plucked a half-smoked cigar from an ashtray and examined\nit, as if deciding whether to finish it off. He tossed it into the rubbish bin at\nhis feet.\n“I’d rather not have had to,” Adamat murmured.\n“You need a break. Not more work. I see that now. You should come on\na trip with me,” Ricard said.\n“What? Where?”\n“The grand opening of the Pan-Deliv Canal!” Ricard stood up and threw\nback the curtains on his window to reveal the ugliness of the factory dock-\nfronts with the backdrop of a rainstorm raging across the Adsea. He cocked\nan eyebrow at the weather and closed the curtains.\n“I thought it was called the King Manhouch Canal?”\n“No king, no King Manhouch Canal.” Ricard opened his cigar box and\noffered one to Adamat, which he refused.\n“I will not let you cheer me up,” Adamat said.\nRicard waved his hand in front of him as if envisioning a sign hanging\nfrom the wall. “I wanted to call it the Tumblar Crossing, but my Ministerial\nElection Committee seems to think that humility looks better to the voting\npublic, while the council wanted something to strengthen ties with Deliv.”\nRicard struck a match and lit his cigar. “I give up so much for the greater\ngood.”\n“You poor man,” Adamat said.\n“You’ll come to the grand opening?”\n“No.” What could possibly make Ricard think that Adamat would want\nto travel, after all his ordeals? He closed his eyes, trying to escape the stink\nof those oysters. “What about Privileged Borbador?”\n“I’ll leave word for my people to help him. Come with me. I insist,”\nRicard said.\n“Absolutely not. My wife is in no shape to travel. My children—”\n“Your children can come. I’ll hire the nannies, and you and Faye can\nride in my carriage.

Go home and ask her. My bet is that she’s\nalready packed. It’ll do you both good to get out of the city.”\n“If you planned this all out, why that rubbish about the profiteering\ngenerals?”\n“I wanted to get your thoughts on it. You weren’t very helpful.”\n“I couldn’t possibly—”\n“All expenses are on me,” Ricard said. He leaned over his desk, his nose\nwrinkling as incense wafted in his face. “Go home and get ready. My\ncarriage will pick you up in three hours. No more arguments.”\n“I won’t be bullied.” Adamat tried to get angry. He wanted to lean across\nthe desk and smack Ricard, but the fury just wasn’t there. Ricard was right.\nHe needed to get out of the city and have some fresh air. If the children\ncould come, and Faye had already agreed, perhaps it would do them all\nsome good.\n“Three hours,” Ricard said.\nAdamat kicked the travel case, sending stacks of banknotes across the\nfloor. “All right, damn it! Just throw out those damned oysters!”\nRicard stood up straight and nodded, pinching his nose at the pungent\nodor. “Agreed.”\nTaniel didn’t know whether to curse his luck or to praise it.\nGeneral Ket could very well have sent him to the noose. She had the\nbacking of the rest of the senior staff—all but General Hilanska, it seemed.\nFell’s arrival couldn’t have been more timely, and Abrax’s offer of\nemployment with the Wings would let him stay on the front.\nBut to be thrown out of the Adran army? The thought still made him\nstumble. He’d been raised in the army. He’d marched and killed and bled\nfor them for nearly half his life and now they tossed him aside like\nunwanted trash, all because he accused the General Staff of helping Kez.\nAnd perhaps they were. Their retreat orders were suspiciously well\ntimed, and their refusal to hold the line even when the Kez were beaten was\nbaffling.\nNothing Taniel could do about it now except join the Wings of Adom.\nHe’d have a chance to finally finish off the Kez Privileged, and maybe once\nall those damned sorcerers were dead, they’d stop making Wardens of any\nkind. Of course, Taniel also needed a way to get Kresimir’s blood so that\nKa-poel could kill him.\nThat seemed like the easy part.\nAn explosion sent Taniel reeling.

Taniel cocked his\nhead, listening for the trumpets to call the men to arms.\nHis gaze drifted to the beam erected in the middle of the Kez camp and\nJulene’s body hanging from it and he wondered again how she’d ended up\nthere. She had been so willful, so powerful. Had Kresimir done it? Taniel\ncouldn’t imagine anyone else having the power to subdue her like that.\nTaniel waited. Silence. There wasn’t even an alarm in case the Kez\nattempted a surprise attack.\nThe sun was just setting when Taniel reached his quarters in a small\nshed. He had a couple hours to find Ka-poel and gather his things. Should\nhe say good-bye to anyone? Etan would remain in contact. Was there\nanyone else?\nTaniel leaned against the door to the shed he’d been using as quarters.\nNo. There wasn’t anyone else. For all his time in the Adran army, Taniel\nhad few friends. That should have made it easier to leave.\nIt should have…\nTaniel opened the door. The waning sunlight slashed across the inside of\nthe room.\nKa-poel lay naked on the cot, her hands stretched above her head, her\nface hidden in the shadows. Taniel felt his face turn red. He averted his\neyes.\n“Pole, what are you doing?”\nA fist connected with his stomach, doubling him over. A pair of hands\nshoved him inside. He fell to the floor, trying to gather his wits as the door\nclosed behind him.\nTaniel scrambled to get to his feet. Something hard slammed into his\nback and he felt a blade against his throat. His mouth went dry.\n“Don’t move, powder mage.”\nA match was struck and the lantern beside the bed lit. There were five\nmen crowded into the small room. They leered down at Taniel. Each one\ncarried a truncheon or a knife. The lot of them reeked of whiskey. They\nwore Adran military jackets with a patch on the shoulder that showed the\nemblem of a shovel.\nDredgers. Third Brigade. The lowest of the low in the entire Adran\nmilitary.\nGeneral Ket’s men.\nOne of the soldiers took a swig from a bottle in his hand and punched\nTaniel in the face. The blow was hard and well placed, forcing Taniel down\nfarther. By the soldier’s stripes on his shoulder, he was a captain.\nTaniel stared at the floor, watching long tendrils of bloody saliva drop on\nthe wood. “Who the pit are you?” he spat.\nThe captain sniffed. “General Ket told us we’d get this little piece here."

Her face was bruised and black, her lip split and bloody. She’d been\nbeaten badly.\nHe surged to his feet. Someone was quick enough with a truncheon to\nbash him across the shoulders. Taniel didn’t even feel it. His right hand\ngrasped the captain’s chin, fingers in the man’s mouth. His left hand\ngrabbed the captain by the forehead.\nTaniel felt the pop and tear of muscles, bone, and tendon as he tore the\ncaptain’s jaw off. Deep inside, the sound frightened him, but all objections\nwere silenced by his rage.\nHe took a truncheon blow across the side of the face and turned on the\nwielder. His fist hit the soldier’s nose hard enough to kill him instantly. Red\nfilled Taniel’s vision like a thick fog, and his body moved as if on its own\naccord.\nTaniel couldn’t remember killing the last three, but he was soon\nsurrounded by five corpses, their blood still warm on his hands and shirt.\nHe dropped to his knees beside Ka-poel. She was breathing lightly. Her\neyes fluttered open.\n“Shh,” Taniel said when her mouth opened. He covered her with a\nblanket and then snatched his only other jacket from the bedpost, throwing\nit on over his blood-soaked shirt. He grabbed his sketchbook and his kit and\nthrew them in his bag, then lifted Ka-poel in his arms. There was nothing\nelse in this room that mattered.\nHe spotted her satchel, discarded in the corner, and grabbed it as he left.\nTaniel sprinted the entire way to the Wings camp. As soon as he reached\nthe pickets, he began to call for a doctor. Confused infantrymen regarded\nhim from their posts as he raced by.\nThe brigadiers’ tents were not hard to find in the center of the camp.\n“Is this Abrax’s tent?” Taniel demanded.\nThe two sentries exchanged a glance.\n“Brigadier Abrax! I must see her now!”\n“Two-Shot?”\nTaniel whirled to see Abrax approaching from the way he’d come. She\nwas probably just returning from the Adran camp, and he realized they’d\nspoken less than twenty minutes ago.\n“What the pit are you…” Her eyes took in his bloody shirt and Ka-poel’s\nbruised body. “What happened?”\n“I need a doctor for her. Now!”\n“Get a doctor,” Abrax barked at the sentries. “Bring her into my tent.\nThere, set her on the cot. What happened to her? Holy saints, what\nhappened to you? You’re covered in blood. Did you do this to her?”\n“No!” Taniel roared the word before he was able to control himself.\n“No. I didn’t. She’s all that matters. See to her, please.”\n“It’ll be done,” Abrax said."

See to her, please.”\n“It’ll be done,” Abrax said.\n“I’ve just killed five men,” Taniel said. “Soldiers in the Third Brigade. It\nwas in self-defense, but they’ll be coming for me shortly.”\nAbrax blinked at the news. She opened her mouth, then shut it. “You\nwere attacked?” she finally managed.\n“Yes.”\n“Details, man. Now!”\n“Five men jumped me in my quarters. They had Ka-poel like this… they\nwere going to… while I watched.” Taniel heard his words flow out in\nbroken, rushed sentences.\n“You were unarmed?”\nTaniel nodded.\nAbrax put her hand to her mouth and studied Taniel. “You’re in shock.\nSit down. Were you in a powder trance?”\n“No.”\n“Five men,” she breathed, almost too low for Taniel to hear. “With his\nbare hands.” She glanced at Ka-poel. “The doctors will be here soon. Stay\nhere.”\nAbrax crossed to the head of the tent. “Stewart!” she bellowed as she\nwent. Abrax stepped outside, but she spoke loudly enough that Taniel could\nhear her clearly. “Ah, there you are. Get our best internal investigators.\nSend them to the Adran camp immediately. There has been a quintuple\nmurder and I want to know the exact circumstances leading up to it.”\n“We going after someone? Or trying to determine how the victims\narrived at their deaths?” a male voice asked. Stewart, Taniel assumed.\n“We’re not going after anything but the truth. And they’re not victims,\nthey’re potential rapists. Dig up everything you can on them. I want to\nknow exactly what type of people they were and what they were doing\nbefore their deaths.”\n“Yes, ma’am.”\n“And close the camp to the Adran provosts and stifle any rumors going\naround.”\n“Of course. Anything else?”\n“Stay close. I’m sure I’ll need something.”\nAbrax returned to the tent a moment later. Taniel thought to stand, and\nrealized that he’d taken Ka-poel’s hand at some point. He decided to stay by\nher side.\n“Thank you,” he said.\n“Believe me this,” Abrax said, her face flushed, her brow furrowed. “If\nyou’ve lied to me, I’ll put the noose around your neck myself. But I won’t\nsee a man lose his life because he defended himself and his loved one.”\nThe doctor came moments later. Taniel refused to leave the tent, but did\navert his eyes as the doctor examined Ka-poel. She struggled a little—he\nhoped that was a good sign.\n“I’ve given her something to help her sleep,” the doctor said after her\nexamination. She glared at Taniel. “She’s suffered a brutal assault.”\n“It wasn’t him,” Abrax snapped.\nThe doctor’s glare lost its bite. “She wasn’t raped, and she had blood\nbeneath her nails, and her knuckles are bruised. She gave them a good fight.\nThat might help you catch them.”\n“They’re dead already,” Taniel said flatly.\n“Good. Her languid state is from exhaustion. She might have fought"

Her left arm is broken, and she might lose an ear. No\nconcussion, though, and that’s remarkable.”\nTaniel returned to Ka-poel’s side, barely noticing that Abrax lowered\nherself into a chair nearby to watch them.\nTaniel wasn’t sure how late it was when he heard angry shouting outside\nthe tent. Abrax lifted herself warily from her chair and went outside.\n“What did I say about a closed camp?” Abrax demanded.\n“Brigadier Abrax,” a sharp voice said.\nTaniel put his head in his hands. Doravir.\n“You’re harboring a man wanted for the murder of four infantrymen and\na captain of the Third Brigade. Release him to our custody now.”\nCHAPTER\n31\nN\nila felt her fingers shaking as she tried to position the needle beside her\ntarget.\n“Don’t be nervous,” Bo said. His voice was soft and soothing. He sat\ncross-legged on a faded pillow in one corner of the room beside the only\nwindow, a musty old tome of a book cradled in his lap while he watched\nher. “If you mess up, it’s all right. I’ll only be burned from the inside out by\notherworldly fire, consumed like a bale of hay soaked in lantern oil.”\n“You’re not making this any easier,” Nila said. She took a deep breath\nand stabbed the needle into one of his Privileged’s gloves. The positioning\nlooked right. It had to be perfect for the gloves to work properly.\n“I know,” Bo said. She could hear his grin in his tone.\n“Why can’t you do this yourself?”\n“Because I hate sewing. And you’re a laundress. You’re probably far\nbetter at it than I am anyway.”\nAnd Nila owed him. Even if he didn’t say it, Nila was certain it had\ncrossed his mind.\nShe was painfully aware that Bo had offered to shelter her and Jakob for\nthree days. That had been nine days ago, and she wasn’t entirely certain\nwhy he hadn’t forced them out into the street. A Privileged seemed the last\ntype of person to whom she would want to owe a favor, so when he\nmentioned that he had several pairs of ripped gloves that needed mending,\nshe volunteered.\nThat was before she knew that the stitching on Privileged’s gloves had to\nbe perfect. Absolutely perfect.\nShe wondered why else he’d let them stay. Perhaps he expected to bed\nher. Out of the corner of her eye, she could see that he was watching her. He\nseemed to do that a lot, but only when he thought she wouldn’t notice. It\nmade her nervous.\nBut he’d given her and Jakob food, shelter, and the first pleasant\ncompany she’d had in a long time. He was calm, quiet, and hadn’t tried to\nforce himself on her. Yet.\nEvery time she started to wonder what it would be like to let herself\nsleep with him, she had to remind herself of Dourford, splattered across the\nstreet. Bo wasn’t just a man. He was a Privileged. Privileged were\ndangerous people."

Privileged were\ndangerous people.\n“This requires a skilled seamstress,” Nila said. “I can sew, but this is—”\n“You’re doing fine.”\nShe returned to her task. She’d managed to finish three of the twelve\ngloves he’d stashed away for repair. Whether any of them could be used…\n“Will you really burn from the inside out if I do these wrong?” Nila\nasked.\n“No.”\n“You git!”\n“They won’t work, though. Which is just as likely to get me killed.” Bo\nset his book to one side and climbed to his feet, joining her at the table. He\nput on one of the finished gloves and snapped his fingers. “Nothing. This\none won’t do.” He tried on another glove. “Nor this.” He tossed the two\nuseless gloves in their own pile and put on the third. Again, he snapped his\nfingers.\nA small flame appeared at the tips of his fingers. The flame went out and\nhe removed the glove, putting it in his pocket. “This will. Excellent.”\n“Do you want me to…” Nila reached for the two useless gloves.\n“Don’t worry about it. I’ll dispose of those ones.”\nFor a moment she thought he was going to return to his pillow and his\nbook. Instead, he pulled out a chair and sat down. He kicked out another\nchair with his feet and put them up, leaning back with his hands folded\nbehind his head. “Where’s the boy? I haven’t heard a peep out of him all\nday.”\n“He’s playing in his room. I told him to keep quiet so that you could\nread.”\n“Very considerate of you.”\nNila made a mistake in her stitching. She cursed under her breath and\npulled the needle back out to try again. Why was he watching her? What\ndid he want?\n“You’re a very good-looking girl. Did you know that?”\nOh. That was why. Nila felt her heart skip a beat. She’d heard rumors\nthat Privilegeds had a powerful sex drive. That cabal Privileged each had\nseveral concubines, and that few women could resist them.\n“I’ve been told that before,” Nila said.\n“You should wear your hair back more often. It helps display those\ncheekbones.”\nNila didn’t trust herself to speak. Had he asked about Jakob because he\nwas hoping to get her alone? Would he give her an ultimatum: Either get\nout or come to my bed? Nila resolved not to do it. She still had her silver\nhidden outside the city. She’d been thinking about this ever since Bo first\ntook them in. She’d get the silver and take Jakob northeast into Novi. They\nwould head to the capital and get a small house there, and she’d take up as a\nlaundress.\nBo opened his mouth.\nHere it comes, Nila thought.\n“Do your parents live in the city?”\n“I won’t…! What?”\n“Your parents,” Bo said. “Do they live in the city?”\nNila was taken aback by the question. “My parents are dead,” she\nanswered curtly. This wasn’t what she’d expected him to say. “I’m an"

This wasn’t what she’d expected him to say. “I’m an\norphan.”\n“Oh,” Bo said. “Sorry to hear that.”\n“I never knew them.”\nBo was staring at the ceiling. His tone was wistful. “I knew my father a\nlittle before he died. I spent some time in an orphanage, too. Then out on\nthe streets for me.”\nNila almost laughed. Was this how he’d try to get her to bed? Make\nthem feel some kind of kinship? “And then the royal cabal?”\n“No. First Taniel Two-Shot. And then his father, Tamas, took me in.\nThat’s where the dowsers found me. Did you ever get tested as a child?”\nBo knew Field Marshal Tamas? He’d been adopted by him? That\nseemed far-fetched. “Tested?”\n“By the cabal dowsers. For ability.”\nNila saw another mistake she’d made. She pulled out the needle and\nused the tip to pick out the thread. “Of course. They came to the orphanage\nevery year.”\n“You should try again,” Bo said. He removed a pair of gloves from his\npockets and tossed them on the table. “Sometimes the dowsers miss\nsomeone.”\nNila wanted to roll her eyes. He was still flirting with her. She could tell\nby the tiny smile at the corners of his mouth, and by the playful tone of his\nvoice. “I don’t think so.”\n“Suit yourself.” Bo put the gloves back in his pocket.\nThere were several blissful minutes of silence while Nila sewed and Bo\nsat in his chair, rocking back on two legs and staring at the ceiling. Nila’s\nmind began to wander. Maybe she shouldn’t go to Novi. Perhaps she should\nhead across the ocean to faraway Fatrasta. Less likely she or Jakob would\never be found or recognized.\n“Jakob,” Bo suddenly said. “His last name was Eldaminse, right?”\n“Yes.”\n“And you worked for his family?”\nNila nodded. The Eldaminse house. That seemed like so long ago. Had it\nreally only been four months? Memories of that place felt like visions of a\nworld from a dream.\n“Did you know anything about his father’s business?”\n“I was a laundress.”\n“Servants hear everything. That’s why so many of them spy for the\ncabals.”\nNila blinked. “They do?”\n“Well. Indirectly. They don’t know who they’re spying for, they just\nknow they’re being paid for information.”\n“I never did. I was taught never to snoop.”\n“Pity.” Bo rocked his chair down onto all four legs and stood up.\n“Jakob,” he called, heading down a short hall toward the room Nila and\nJakob were sharing.\nNila paused in her sewing and cocked her head to one side.\n“Jakob,” Bo said, his voice muffled, “do you remember if your father\nwas ever visited by any military men?”\nNila couldn’t hear Jakob’s answer.\n“Really? Interesting. How long ago was that?” There was a pause, and\nthen, “Thank you, Jakob. You were very helpful.”"

I’ll likely not be back\nuntil tomorrow. There’s a small stack of banknotes hidden under the\nwindowsill. Feel free to get you and the boy some food.” He stopped in the\ndoor, his gloves in one hand. He seemed preoccupied. “Are you sure you\ndon’t want to try on my gloves?”\nNila pushed her chair back and stood up.\n“I’ve had enough of this,” she said.\nBo’s eyebrows rose. He seemed genuinely surprised. “Of…?”\n“Your flirting. I’ll leave if you want us to, but I’m not going to bed with\nyou.”\nBo took several quick steps across the room, coming to a stop with less\nthan a handbreadth between them. He leaned forward, and Nila could hear\nher heart thumping in her ears. She became acutely aware that if Bo did try\nto force himself on her, or to hurt her or Jakob, she couldn’t do a thing\nabout it.\n“I flirt with everyone,” Bo whispered in her ear. “And if you wanted to\ngo to bed with me, I wouldn’t say no. But I’ve never raped a woman and\nnever will. So stop cringing every time you catch me looking at you. I like\nlooking at people. I find them fascinating.”\nNila’s throat was dry. A glance down showed her that Bo still wasn’t\nwearing his gloves. “If you don’t expect me to go to bed with you, why\nhaven’t you made us leave?”\n“Because I like you,” Bo said. “And I like the kid. But I’m leaving the\ncity soon and you should figure out your plans. I won’t be here longer than\na week.” He stepped away. “See you tomorrow?”\nNila swallowed. “Yes.”\n“Glad to hear it.”\nTamas’s army crossed the last of Kresimir’s Fingers and ascended the wide\nplateau of the Northern Expanse almost seven weeks after they’d left\nBudwiel.\nThe Northern Expanse, like the Amber Expanse to the south, was a\nbreadbasket of the Nine. Unlike the Amber Expanse, it was not home to\ncattle farms or wheat fields but to immense bean fields, which could survive\nbetter with little water.\nTamas ordered forage teams to spread out across the plateau, under the\ncommand of the most levelheaded sergeants in the army. He needed to strip\nthe land of its resources while making this as painless to the native\npopulation as possible.\nHe rode at the head of the column, eyes on the northern horizon. It\nwould be several days before they crossed the Deliv border and could see\nthe city of Alvation, but he couldn’t help that his heart beat faster with\nevery step. Soon, they’d find relief. Soon, they’d cross the Charwood Pile\nMountains and descend into Adro, taking the fight back to the Kez."

He and his horse were coated in dust from\ncoming up behind the column. Not far behind him, an old man rode a pack\nmule. He had a hard time keeping up with Gavril’s charger. Tamas reined in\nhis mount. Olem stopped too, his eyes vigilant despite the plateau being\nempty but for their army.\n“Who is this?” Tamas said, nodding at the old man, who was still fifty\npaces off.\n“A Kez bean farmer.”\n“Why is he here?”\n“Wanted to talk to you.”\nTamas cocked an eyebrow at Gavril. This was the last thing he needed.\nWhy on earth would Gavril bring him here? “Does he know who I am?”\n“Yes, and he has some interesting things to say.”\nWhat could an old bean farmer on the Northern Expanse have to say of\ninterest?\nThe old man brought his burro up beside their horses.\n“Are you the field marshal?” the old man said in Adran. The Kez accent\nwas so thick that the words were barely distinguishable. His face was\nwrinkled, his skin brown from the hot sun of the plateau and perhaps a mix\nof Deliv blood. Labor and trade went on freely between the Deliv to the\nnorth and Kez farmers on the plateau.\nThe old bean farmer was emaciated. He might have been plump at one\npoint, but the skin now sagged from his cheeks and sickly splotches on his\nface spoke to malnutrition.\nThe man’s eyes held a smoldering anger that surprised Tamas.\n“I speak Kez,” Tamas said in Kez.\n“Are you the field marshal?” the bean farmer said again in Kez.\n“I am. Good afternoon.”\nThe bean farmer spit at the feet of Tamas’s charger. He bared his teeth\nand glared, as if daring Tamas to do anything about it.\nTamas looked at Gavril. His brother-in-law, still bruised from their fight\nlast week, just shrugged his shoulders.\n“Something wrong?” Tamas asked.\n“You tell me.”\nTamas shot another glance at Gavril. What was this all about?\n“I can’t imagine.”\n“You took my crop,” the old man said. “It was a good one this year,\nconsidering the drought. You took my wife and daughters. Your blasted men\nbroke my son’s legs when he refused to serve them!”\nTamas scowled. Damned infantry. Even the best couldn’t keep\nthemselves under control. He’d ordered that women be left alone under\npenalty of death. The food, they needed, but Tamas didn’t need his soldiers\nraping and killing their way across the Kez countryside.\n“What company did this?” he asked Gavril.\n“None of ours. The man and his son were alone in his hut when the\nforage teams found him. The place had been stripped bare, all the furniture\nbroken. The boy’s legs were broken, like he says. The lad will be a cripple\nfor life. Looks like it happened weeks ago.”\n“I’m sorry about your wife and daughters,” Tamas said, “but it wasn’t"

Looks like it happened weeks ago.”\n“I’m sorry about your wife and daughters,” Tamas said, “but it wasn’t\nmy men.”\n“Are you calling me a liar?” The bean farmer edged his mule closer to\nTamas.\nTamas took a deep breath and reminded himself that striking an old man\nwasn’t the best way to end a conversation. “When did this happen?”\n“Eighteen days ago,” the bean farmer said.\n“It couldn’t have been us. We just arrived.”\n“Then who was it? I know Adran troops when I see them.” The bean\nfarmer leaned over to pluck at Tamas’s jacket. “Adran blues, with silver\ntrim. I’m not a fool!”\n“How many men?”\n“Thousands of ya!” The bean farmer spit again.\n“Gavril, any sign an army came through here recently?”\nGavril rode off a few feet to confer with one of his scouts. He came back\na moment later. “Foraging teams are all reporting the same thing—the\nland’s been stripped clean. All the crops were harvested early, or burned,\nand the men have come across dozens of empty farmsteads.”\nTamas drummed his fingers on his saddle horn. The forage he’d been\nexpecting on the Northern Expanse—gone. All of it. Nothing for his men to\neat on the way to Alvation.\n“Well?” the bean farmer demanded. “What do you have to say for\nyourself?”\n“Which way were they headed?” Tamas asked.\nThe bean farmer seemed taken aback. “North.”\n“Olem, give this man enough food for him and his son and send him\nback to his home. Let him keep the mule.” Tamas flicked the reins.\n“Gavril.”\nTamas left the cursing old bean farmer in Olem’s hands and rode back to\nthe head of the column. Gavril came up beside him, letting his charger keep\npace with Tamas’s.\n“This doesn’t make sense,” Tamas said. “We don’t have any troops in\nnorthern Kez.”\n“I’d say the old man isn’t right in the head, but the place has been swept\nclean. It would have taken a great number of men to come through and strip\nthe plateau like this.”\nTamas gripped his saddle horn. How was he going to feed his men with\nno forage?\n“How many?” Tamas asked.\nGavril scratched the stubble on his chin. “At least a brigade or two.”\n“Wearing Adran blue, but not Adran.” Tamas mused it over in his head.\n“Shit! They’re trying to slip into Adro.”\n“The Kez?”\n“It must be. They come through here, acting like an invading army—\nbluff their way through Alvation and then take an unsuspecting\nMountainwatch. They might be in Adro already.”\n“What should we do?” Gavril asked.\nTamas let his fingers play upon the butt of one of the saw-handled\ndueling pistols stuck in his belt. A gift from his son. “We keep going.

        "text": "CHAPTER\n32\nR\nicard Tumblar’s carriage jolted along the winding highway at the base of\nthe Charwood Pile Mountain Range, headed north toward the Pan-Deliv\nCanal. Mountains rose above them immediately to the west, and there were\nmore in the distance to the north, their white tops looking like frosting on\npeaked cakes. The carriage thumped, then clattered over a stone bridge\ncrossing a tributary of the Ad River and then it was back to the pitted dirt\nroad.\nAdamat stared out the window and tried not to think of the jarring of the\nground. The last thing he needed was to throw up all over the velvet\ninterior.\nFive days in a carriage was no pleasant prospect, even one as fancy as\nRicard’s. The undercarriage employed the very newest leaf-spring\nsuspension and the thick, padded seats helped absorb some rocking of the\nroad, but nothing prevented Adamat’s head from hitting the roof when they\nhit a particularly deep hole in the road.\nDamn these northern roads.\nAt least Faye seemed to be enjoying herself, as much as she could under\nthe circumstance. She had become even more withdrawn after her decision\nnot to go after Josep. Her weeping had stopped, though, and she seemed\nmore resolved to put on a good face for the other children.\n“We’ll have these roads fixed up better once the canal comes into more\nuse,” Ricard was saying, his head craned out the window. “I’d like to see\nthe whole thing cobbled, with a full-time union crew to tend to maintenance\nyear-round.”\nAdamat longed to reach their destination. Just a couple hours away, or so\nRicard had said. They’d be staying at the finest hotel in northern Adro.\nRoom service, massages, hot running water. The hotel was brand-new, built\nto accommodate dignitaries and businessmen taking the canal over the\nCharwood Pile.\n“Couldn’t you just leave it to the Mountainwatch?” Adamat asked. “The\nmaintenance, I mean. We’re in the foothills. That counts as their territory.”\nRicard wagged a finger under his nose. “No! No, no, no. I fought tooth\nand nail for the canal to be a union project. The Mountainwatch wanted in\non it. Claimed it was their jurisdiction, or some such tripe, but this is a\nunion job! The union employs good, hardworking Adrans. Not the convicts\nand malcontents of forced labor like the Mountainwatch.”\n“Surely they’re guarding the pass,” Adamat said.\n“No,” Ricard said proudly. “Purely union, even down to the lock\nguards.”\nThat surprised Adamat. The Mountainwatch was more than just a\nforced-labor institution. It had a long tradition of guarding the high places—\nthey were the gatekeepers of Adro, and they’d proved that again in the\nrecent defense of Shouldercrown Fortress.\nAdamat understood that Ricard was proud of his unions, but unionizing\nthe defense of the country seemed strange.\nThey stopped for a midday meal several miles south of the canal.\nAdamat and Faye dined with their children and their hired nannies while\nRicard met with Fell about plans for the mountain. When lunch was over,\nAdamat wandered outside to stretch his legs."

When lunch was over,\nAdamat wandered outside to stretch his legs.\nThe inn sat next to a small stream—runoff from the mountains. Adamat\nlistened to the bubbling sound it made as it meandered under the road and\ndown toward the river, then looked north.\nAdamat could see the locks of the canal from where he stood. They\nworked their way up the side of the mountain like steps, the road zigzagging\nits way up beside them. The whole setup looked like a model at this\ndistance, and even seeing it with his own eyes, he scarcely believed it to be\nreal. A canal going over an entire mountain range!\nThe locks themselves were a feat of engineering never before seen in\nthis world. They were built purely by the labor of men, no sorcery at all,\nunless you count the few Knacked that the union no doubt employed for\ntheir various skills. Despite the rigors of the journey, Adamat knew that\ntouring the locks prior to the grand opening was going to be worth the\nwhole trip.\nJosep would have loved to have seen the canal.\nRicard and Fell came outside, studying a map together and pointing at\nthe road. He could hear them discussing the benefits of cobbles versus brick\nor poured concrete.\nSomething on the mountainside caught Adamat’s eye. At this distance,\nhe couldn’t be sure, but…\n“Ricard,” he said, interrupting the two, “do you have a looking glass?”\nFell said, “I do.” She went back to the carriage and returned a moment\nlater, handing Adamat a looking glass.\n“I thought you said that the grand opening wasn’t until tomorrow,”\nAdamat said to Ricard.\nRicard squinted toward the canal. “It’s not.”\n“You’re not supposed to have any traffic on the canal?”\n“Not yet. I mean, they’ve been tested, but no commercial traffic until\nafter the grand opening. Why, what do you see?”\nAdamat put the looking glass to his eye and found the locks. They came\ninto focus, and then he saw what had caught his eye.\nEach of those locks held a ship—and not just any ships, but oceangoing\nmerchantmen with rows of cannon and tall masts. There had to be dozens of\nthem, and he could see the tiny figures of men working the locks as the\nentire row of ships slowly descended the side of the mountain.\nThe ships bore green-and-white-striped flags, marked in the center with\na laurel wreath. Adamat felt his legs grow weak and a growing dread in the\npit of his stomach.\nHe thrust the looking glass into Fell’s hands. “Get the children back in\nthe carriages. We’re going back to Adopest. Now!”\n“What?” Ricard demanded, snatching the looking glass. “What is wrong\nwith you? The grand opening is tomorrow, we’re…” He fell silent as he put\nthe looking glass to his eye.\n“It’s a good thing you didn’t let the Mountainwatch guard your canal,”\nAdamat shouted over his shoulder as he ran toward the inn. “Otherwise it\nwould have been harder for the Brudania-Gurla Trading Company to bring\ntheir whole damn fleet across it.”"

The one that wasn’t swollen shut.\nTaniel went on. “General Ket says this is a civil matter because I’m no\nlonger in the Adran army and I’m not officially in the Wings of Adom yet.\nI’m to be sent back to Adopest under house arrest to await trial.” Taniel\npaced the short length of the tent. He held in his hand a note from Brigadier\nAbrax telling him the conditions of his house arrest. “That could take\nmonths. The war might be over by then, and we’ll have lost.”\nTaniel stopped pacing and dropped onto his cot. What could he do? He’d\nspent the last hour arguing with Abrax. The brigadier claimed her hands\nwere tied, that she could do nothing but provide Taniel with a small house\nin Adopest. The Wings of Adom’s charter did not allow them to admit\nanyone awaiting trial.\n“I’m going to kill her,” Taniel said.\nKa-poel struggled to sit up in her cot. They’d been given a tent in the\ncorner of the Wings’ camp at the farthest point from the Adran army. Her\ngreen eyes were wet. Taniel suspected she’d cried during the night.\nHe thought that perhaps his rage would fade as the days passed and Ka-\npoel was sitting up and able to move. If anything, seeing her wounds heal\nslowly made him even angrier. Her lips were swollen and cracked, her face\nstill bruised.\nShe spread her hands, awkwardly because her arm was in a sling. Who?\n“General Ket. She must have ordered what they… what they did to you.\nShe must have known she wouldn’t be able to send me to the noose so\neasily. Those men had you for hours.”\nKa-poel shook her head.\n“No? ‘No’ what? The doctor said you fought back. That you…”\nAnother emphatic shake of her head. She motioned with her thumb over\nher shoulder and then made a snatching motion. She pointed to herself.\n“They caught you?”\nShe thought for a moment, and then made a walking motion with her\nfingers.\n“Followed you?”\nA nod.\nShe reached for her satchel and winced. Taniel lifted it for her. She took\nit from him and began to rummage around inside.\nKa-poel began to lay out dolls on the cot. They were instantly\nrecognizable: General Hilanska, General Ket; the entire General Staff of the\nAdran army.\nTaniel stared at the dolls. Each time he saw one, he was amazed by the\ndetail she put into the wax, but here it was something more. He knew all of\nthese people. Some of them, like Hilanska, he’d known since childhood.\nBits of real hair protruded from the wax in places. A drop of blood was\nrubbed on one of them. It made his skin crawl.\n“Why were you making dolls for them?” Taniel asked.\nKa-poel tilted her head to the side as if to tell him it was a stupid\nquestion.\n“Just in case, right?”"

What\nshe’d done was incredibly dangerous. If people suspected the nature of her\nsorcery and saw her skulking about the general’s quarters, she could have\nbeen beaten and locked up.\n“Still,” he went on, “they said that she’d told them they could have you.”\nThe anger ebbed. Only a little, but it was enough to make his muscles relax.\nHe leaned back in his chair, putting his hands over his face. “I should still\nkill her.”\nKa-poel thrust her thumb at herself. I will. A flat hand, as if to stop, and\nshe mouthed the words “If I need to.”\n“Pit, Pole, I—”\n“Knock, knock!” The voice came from outside the front of the tent.\n“May I come in?”\nMihali. The damned chef. If it weren’t for him, none of this would have\never happened. Taniel would still be in the Adran army and Ka-poel would\nnever have been beaten by Ket’s thugs.\n“Go to—!” Taniel started, when Ka-poel lay a soft hand on his arm.\nShe nodded. Taniel took a deep, calming breath. It didn’t help.\n“Yes,” he called.\nThe flap was swept back and Mihali ducked into the tent, carrying a\nwide platter. Steam rose from beneath the platter cover with the smell of\nwarm bread and, what was that? Eggs.\nTaniel looked away. He wouldn’t give Mihali the satisfaction of eating\nhis food.\nMihali set the platter on Taniel’s cot and removed the lid. He leaned over\nit, wafting the smell of it toward him. “Warm cornmeal cake with a sweet\ncrust drizzled in maple honey with poached eggs on the side.”\nKa-poel’s face lit up. Cornmeal cake was a Fatrastan staple, uncommon\nin the Nine. She snatched one up immediately, tossing it between her hands\nuntil it cooled enough to hold.\nTaniel smiled, though he tried to cover it with a cough. He wasn’t about\nto let Mihali see him pleased.\n“What do you want, Adom?”\n“Oh, please,” Mihali said. “Call me Mihali. ‘Adom’ has such a high-\nand-mighty connotation.”\n“Well”—Taniel’s mouth watered at the smell of the cornbread—“what\ndo you want?”\n“I’ve come to apologize,” Mihali said.\nKa-poel patted the cot beside her.\n“Thank you!” Mihali took a seat, and Taniel felt a stab of jealousy.\n“Apologize? For telling me to make amends with Doravir and getting\nme kicked out of the Adran army?”\nMihali’s eyebrows rose. “Heavens, no. That needed to happen.”\n“It what?” Taniel sputtered."

That needed to happen.”\n“It what?” Taniel sputtered.\nMihali waved a hand as if it were of little consequence.\n“I came to apologize because I told you that I would not help you kill\nKresimir and that I did not think he needed to die.”\nTaniel couldn’t help it any longer. His hand reached out, as if it had a\nmind of its own, and took a piece of cornbread. He bit in and was instantly\nglad. The cornbread was soft and moist, seemingly melting in his mouth,\nand the honey tasted as if it were straight from the comb.\n“You changed your mind?” Taniel asked around bites.\n“I wish,” Mihali said, plucking a piece of cornbread from the platter and\nsmearing it with fruit spread, “that this could be solved amicably. Or even at\nall. A couple of months ago I made a deal with Kresimir that neither of us\nwould contribute to the war directly. Since then it’s gone badly for the\nAdran side—as you can tell—but things are not well in the Kez camp\neither.” Mihali paused to lick honey and crumbs off his fingertips.\n“Kresimir has taken to killing his own people at an alarming rate.”\n“Good,” Taniel snorted.\n“No,” Mihali said. “Not good. I speak with Kresimir often. We can\nbridge space for that purpose, and when we do, I can see a bit into his mind.\nHe’s going mad.” Mihali swallowed and looked down at his cornbread\nsadly. “Quite thoroughly mad.”\n“I don’t care.”\n“Taniel, how long do you think a mad god would stick to killing his own\npeople? He might very well try to destroy the Nine. Perhaps even the whole\nworld. I don’t think he could—not even Kresimir is that powerful—but if\nhe tried, it would probably kill every living thing in this part of the world.”\n“I already stopped him once,” Taniel said.\n“Which makes you particularly suited to the task.”\n“Couldn’t you stop him?”\n“Sorcery is predictable in some ways,” Mihali said. “There are patterns\nthat all Privileged use, from the lowliest sorcerer all the way up to Kresimir.\nI can predict those patterns and counter them. However, if Kresimir lashes\nout in his madness, it will be completely random. I could protect myself, but\nno one else.”\nTaniel thought on this for a few moments. Could a god actually go mad?\n“It’s from the bullet, isn’t it?”\nMihali seemed to think on this for a moment. “I have heard reports—\nwhen I lurk about the generals’ staff meetings—from their spies. There is a\nrumor in the Kez camp that Kresimir coughs blood into his pillow. That he\nwanders the halls of his compound at night and accosts his own guards,\ndemanding to know whether they are the eye behind the flintlock.”\nTaniel’s mouth went dry. The eye behind the flintlock. Who else could it\npossibly be but him? Kresimir was looking for him in his madness. The\nwords felt like bile coming out, but Taniel asked, “Can he be healed? At"

At\nleast enough to see reason?”\n“I don’t know,” Mihali said. “I broached the subject with him last night.\nHe was furious. The explosion over in Budwiel? You must have heard it.\nThat was him. It killed thousands of Kez camp followers.”\n“No great loss.”\nMihali scowled. Taniel felt a flicker at the edge of his senses, like\nsorcery was being used. He suddenly wondered whether he should be this\nclose to Mihali.\n“Those people,” Mihali said, visibly restraining himself, “were not\nsoldiers. They were laundresses and bakers and boot makers. Their lives\nwere snuffed out in an instant because I asked Kresimir the wrong question\nand he grew angry.” Mihali shook his head. “I understand that killing is\nyour profession, but every loss of life is great. Especially so many, and all\non the…”\nMihali fell silent. He helped himself to another piece of cornbread and\nchewed thoughtfully. His eyes fell on the dolls laid out opposite him by Ka-\npoel, and his fingers twitched as if he were nervous.\n“He’s coherent enough to create these Powder Wardens,” Taniel said.\nMihali said, “It’s the only thing that gives me hope for his recovery. He’s\nnot all gone. I might be able to heal him. I would need to restrain Kresimir,\nthough, and I can’t do that on my own.”\nMihali was looking at Ka-poel when he said that. Taniel didn’t like it\none bit.\n“How?”\n“She can do it,” Mihali said, nodding at Ka-poel. “I think I mentioned\nthat in my varied lives I have had some contact with Bone-eyes. Their\nmagic is uniquely suited to fighting, harming, protecting, and even\ncontrolling individuals. I’ve never known one with even a fraction of Ka-\npoel’s power. And to think, she taught herself to do all this…” Mihali\ntrailed off. He was breathless, his face flushed.\nControlling individuals, Mihali had said. Did Ka-poel control Taniel? He\nknew that she had protected him before, and he’d seen what she could do\nwith those dolls of hers.\n“And if he’s healed?” Taniel asked. “Will he end this war? Leave Adro\nalone?”\n“I believe so. He’s not been well.”\n“You believe so? Or you know so? He made a promise to destroy Adro.”\n“A promise that will not be kept. I’ll see to it.” Mihali spread his pudgy\nhands, looking from Ka-poel to Taniel. “Please. Help me. Help my brother.”\nKa-poel pointed to her broken arm, and then to Mihali.\nMihali’s eyebrows went up. “Of course. I’ve been remiss.” He closed his\neyes, and Ka-poel suddenly gasped.\nTaniel lurched forward, putting his arm behind her back so that she\nwouldn’t fall. “What did you do to her?”\nKa-poel shrugged Taniel away from her and undid the sling around her"

She flexed and moved it, nodding to herself. He looked at her face.\nThe bruises were gone.\n“I can heal your wounds as well,” Mihali said.\nTaniel flinched away. “I’ll keep them, thank you.” Silently, Taniel called\nhimself a fool. Why refuse the healing powers of a god? Was he afraid of\nMihali’s sorcery? Or perhaps afraid of owing someone else? Abrax and\nRicard has already done Taniel favors that would require years to pay off.\nTaniel touched his fingers to the tender swelling on his face from the\nbeatings given to him by Ket’s gendarmes. “I’ll keep it as a reminder.”\n“I ask,” Mihali said, standing up, “that you consider my request. In\nexchange, I have a gift—freely given.”\nTaniel was wary of any gift given by a god. After all, nothing was free.\n“What?”\nMihali removed a handkerchief and a knife from his pocket. He pressed\none thumb against his knife, then into the handkerchief for a moment, and\nthen handed it to Ka-poel.\nHis blood. The blood of a god. Taniel felt his heart beat a little faster.\nWhat could Ka-poel do with this? Could she control Mihali? Kill him?\nKa-poel tucked the handkerchief silently into her satchel, her face\nunreadable.\nMihali stepped away from them both and busied himself putting the\nremaining cornbread and eggs on a tin plate, which he handed to Ka-poel.\nHe lifted his empty platter and gave a bow. “Please,” he said, “consider my\nrequest—my plea—for help.” He bowed low and then left.\nTaniel took a shaky breath and looked down, only just realizing that he\nstill held the letter regarding his house arrest. He was to be escorted to\nAdopest early in the morning. They’d assigned him eight provosts—four\nfrom the Wings of Adom, four from the Adran army.\nThere would be no fighting the Kez or killing their gods for Taniel.\nKa-poel reached out and touched Taniel’s chest. She thumped him\nseveral times above the heart.\n“What?”\nShe pointed to him and then spread her hands, questioning. Then back at\nhim.\n“I don’t know what you’re getting at, girl,” he said, trying to quell his\nfrustration.\nShe indicated his heart again and pointed emphatically.\n“What do I want?”\nA nod.\nTaniel took a deep breath. “I want to kill something right now. I’m\nfurious. I should be out there fighting. I was born to fight—born to protect\nAdro.”\nShe pointed at him again, then at the floor. What do you want now?\n“I want to protect you.”\nKa-poel smiled then, and Taniel felt his heart jump. She leaned toward\nhim and pressed her lips to his.\n“I’m going after Kresimir’s blood,” Taniel said.\nMihali paused over an immense pot of soup, the ladle halfway to his\nlips.\n“I see.”"

I’ll need\nhelp getting into the Kez camp.”\nMihali considered this for a few moments before taking a sip of his\nsoup. “Mmm. That’s good. Needs a little more pepper, though.” He brought\na jar of whole peppercorns from his apron and poured a measure into the\npalm of his hand. He ground his hands together, watching the pepper fall\ninto the pot. He stirred the soup, then took another sip. “Perfect.”\n“It can be hard to take you seriously sometimes,” Taniel said. “No. I\nmisspoke. All of the time.”\nMihali chuckled, but Taniel hadn’t been making a joke.\n“The Kez camp,” Taniel urged.\n“I can conceal you so that you walk right through the Kez sentries,”\nMihali said, moving to a wide iron grill in the middle of the cooking yard.\nHe began flipping turkey legs with practiced speed.\nTaniel ducked as he heard the sound of a shout behind him. A glance\nover his shoulder told him it wasn’t directed at him. Walking through the\nAdran camp was dangerous, even in civilian clothes with a tricorn hat\npulled down to conceal his face. He was supposed to be under guard by the\nprovosts right now.\n“They won’t notice you here, either. Have a turkey leg.” Mihali picked\nup a leg with his tongs and handed it to Taniel.\n“That looks hot.”\n“Nonsense. A chef would never give a guest something that would burn\nthem.”\nTaniel took the turkey leg with some trepidation. The bone was only\nwarm, despite having just come off the flames, and when he bit into it, juice\nran down his unshaved chin. He didn’t speak until he was done eating.\n“How can you make me unseen?” Taniel asked. “Before, you had to ask\nKa-poel’s permission to touch my mind.”\n“I just did,” Mihali said.\nTaniel froze in the midst of picking the last bits of flavor off the turkey\nleg. He looked around. “I don’t feel unseen.” He glanced down at the turkey\nbone. “Did you…”\n“Yes,” Mihali said. “Doing any kind of constructive sorcery directly to\nthe human body is one of the most difficult things a Privileged can\naccomplish. That’s why healers are so rare. I figured out about a thousand\nyears ago that the easiest way to get a spell into a person was through their\nstomach.” Mihali picked up a turkey leg and took a bite. A sudden look of\nworry crossed his face. “Let’s have that be our secret, hmm?”\nTaniel snorted. “I won’t tell on you.”\n“Oh, thank you.” Mihali finished his turkey leg noisily and then lifted\nanother off the grill. “Care to take one to Ka-poel?”\n“Will it make her unseen?

The spell does have its drawbacks. For instance, it is designed to\ndrop as soon as you get close to Kresimir’s sphere of influence. It would\nbackfire to have Kresimir sense my intrusion.”\nTaniel looked at his hand. He certainly didn’t feel unseen. “How long\ndid it take you to come up with this?”\n“A few moments.”\n“Really?”\nMihali raised an eyebrow. “We’re not called gods necessarily because\nwe’re the most powerful Privileged—though that is an interpretation. We’re\ncalled gods because the things that regular mortals struggle for days, weeks,\nor months to accomplish take us only the effort of a thought.”\n“Ah. Well, I’m going now.”\n“Wait.” Mihali produced a deep pewter mug seemingly out of nowhere\nand crossed to his pot of soup. He ladled the mug full and set a lid on it.\n“Take this to Ka-poel. It’ll help her sleep while you’re gone.”\nTaniel turned to go, when he thought better of it. “Adom—Mihali?”\n“Hmm?”\n“Will you protect her?”\n“I feel after giving her my blood, that it is I who need protection,”\nMihali said. He winked. “That girl is like a glass teapot filled with\ngunpowder. So fragile, but with such a power for destruction.” He\nstraightened up and swung the ladle into a salute. Soup spattered on his\napron. “No harm will come to her.”\n“Thank you,” Taniel said. “Now I’m going to get some of your brother’s\nblood.”\nCHAPTER\n33\nT\namas watched Olem rub down his horse as the camp settled in for the\nnight. A low fire of brush and prairie twigs crackled in a stone ring in front\nof him. The sun still shone in the western sky, lighting the plateau with a\nbrilliant hue of reds, oranges, and pinks.\nTheir second day on the plateau, and their supplies were already running\nlow. They’d slaughtered thousands of Kez horses after the battle fourteen\ndays before, but only been able to carry a limited amount. What little food\nthey had needed to be rationed. A pound of meat per man per day was not\nmuch.\nTamas lifted his head at a sound carried on the wind. He waited a few\nseconds, then returned to gazing at the flames. Beside him, Olem was\nsnapping twigs and feeding them into the fire.\nHis rangers still hadn’t found this mysterious Adran army, but there\nwere plenty of signs of their passing. Stripped bean fields, burned farms.\nThe dead and the dying, the old and the infirm of what was left of the\nfarmers of the Northern Expanse. The plateau was already a dry, exhausted\nland.

Whatever army had come through two weeks ago had killed\neverything living.\nPer his orders, the army had dug a six-foot trench around the entire\ncamp. It was backbreaking work, but he’d be damned if he’d be caught at\nnight by an army he didn’t see coming. Some of his soldiers were still\ndigging. The sound of shovels scraping rocks and dirt, the curses of infantry\nworking after a long day’s march.\nTamas lifted his head again. That sound. What was it? He cocked his\nhead to one side, trying to find a location.\nNothing.\nHad the Deliv turned on him? The king of Deliv had been firm in his\nresponse earlier this summer when Tamas had asked for allies against the\nKez. They’d promised to stay out of the war entirely.\n“May I join you, Field Marshal?”\nTamas looked up. The lengthening shadows tricked his eyes for a\nmoment before he made out Beon je Ipille. Tamas gestured to the bare\nground on the other side of the fire. Beon lowered himself gingerly to the\nground, crossing his legs beneath him. The Kez general’s eyes were sunken,\nhis face pale. He was one of the few Kez officers that Tamas had kept with\nhim as prisoners—the rest were paroled to the Kez army.\n“How is your arm?” Tamas asked.\nBeon looked down at his left arm where it hung in a sling. “It is well,\nthank you. My physician says that the arm is not broken, but I lost quite a\nlot of blood in the melee. I should recover in time. Your injuries?”\n“Fine.” Tamas ran a couple of fingers over his ribs, wincing at the\ntenderness. He didn’t think they’d cracked from his fight with Gavril, but\nhis body felt like one big bruise. “I’m wishing I’d brought Dr. Petrik along\nwhen I left Budwiel. But then again, my plans at the time were greatly\ndifferent from how things ended up.”\nBeon nodded, staring into the fire. He took a deep breath and opened his\nmouth, only to close it again. It was several minutes before he finally spoke.\n“I remember riding through the Northern Expanse once,” Beon said. “It\nmust have been six or seven years ago. I went along with some of my\nfather’s Privileged on a delegation to Deliv. This land was greener, more\nfull.” Beon smiled sadly. “Towns threw festivals in our honor. There were\nthousands of people—proud, happy farmers.\n“Now I can’t help but wonder: what has happened to my country?” Beon\nlooked around. “The last two days, I’ve seen countless abandoned farms.\nThe bean fields are all gone. The land is brown and dry. I’ve heard reports\nof the droughts, both here and in the rest of the Nine, but I didn’t imagine it\nto be so bad.\n“What’s more, where are all my people? We passed a farm this morning.\nThe crop—and there had been a crop, I’m not so removed that I can’t see\nthat—was trampled, and the farm buildings burned remnants. I must ask\nyou, Field Marshal.

I swear it.”\n“It must have been bandits, then.”\nTamas wondered how much he should tell Beon of his suspicions. “I\ndon’t think so.”\nBeon didn’t seem to hear him. “Two days ago,” Beon said, “I rode past\nan old man on a pack mule. He begged me to right the wrongs and expel the\nAdran foreigners that were ravishing our lands.” Beon spoke carefully, as if\ntesting the waters before a swim.\n“My scouts tell me another army has come through this way,” Tamas\nsaid. “And reports from what serfs remain in the area say that they wear\nAdran blues. This makes me wonder, as I know for a fact that I have no\nmen in northern Kez.”\nBeon gazed at Tamas, brow furrowed, as if trying to decide whether\nTamas was speaking the truth.\nTamas asked, “Do you know whether your father sent legions north,\ndisguised as Adrans, in order to sneak through Deliv and over the\nmountains?”\n“I don’t. Besides, our soldiers wouldn’t do this to their own land.”\nTamas wondered where Beon got such a high regard for the morals of\ninfantry.\nOlem suddenly grabbed his rifle and surged to his feet. “Sir,” he said,\n“did you hear that?”\nTamas paused and listened. Nothing.\nWait. There. It sounded like a shout. Very distant. He climbed to his feet.\nNearby, a slight rise in the terrain gave him a better vantage point. He\nscanned the horizon, listening for the shout again.\n“There,” Olem said, pointing north.\nDust rose off the plateau, a billowing trail of the kind made when\nmultiple riders were coming hard. “Saddle my mount,” Tamas said to Olem.\n“Quickly!”\nTamas ran through the camp. A few hundred yards from his own tent,\nthe powder mages were camped together. Most of them were there, their\nlegs splayed, boots off, talking as they passed around a bottle they’d got\nfrom who knew where. Vlora stood when she saw Tamas.\n“Andriya, Vlora,” Tamas barked. “With me! The rest of you, raise the\ngeneral alarm. Riders on the northern horizon.”\n“How many, sir?” Vlora asked as they headed back to the north end of\nthe camp.\n“That’s what we’re going to find out,” Tamas said. “Do you know where\nGavril is?”\n“Ranging,” Andriya answered.\n“Where?”\n“North, I think.”\n“Pit. You two, get horses.”\nOlem brought Tamas his horse and rifle. He threw himself into the\nsaddle and headed north, not waiting for anyone else. Olem caught up to\nhim quickly enough—he’d not yet unsaddled his own mount from the day.\n“What’s happening, sir?” Olem shouted over the sound of hooves\nthundering on the dusty soil."

It was getting larger. Too big to be less than twenty\nhorses, and Gavril’s rangers worked in pairs.\nThey left camp behind and headed north along the main road. A glance\nover his shoulder told Tamas that more riders were following him out of the\ncamp, a few hundred yards behind him.\nTamas fumbled in his pocket for a powder charge as his body rocked up\nand down with the motion of the stallion beneath him. He put it straight in\nhis mouth and bit down, tasting the bitter sulfur and the grit between his\nteeth. He spit the soggy charge paper out as the powder trance coursed\nthrough his veins.\nThe ground rushed by beneath his charger’s hooves and the horizon\ncame into stark relief. He found the cloud of dust and traced it to the source.\nThere, miles away, a single horseman.\nTamas frowned. Just one? The horseman lay low on his mount, clinging\nto the horse’s neck. Tamas thought he recognized him as one of Gavril’s\nrangers.\nA few moments later, breasting a rise in terrain behind the ranger, came\nmore riders.\nTheir uniforms were blue with silver trim, and they wore the conical,\nhorsehair helmets of Adran dragoons.\nTamas swore. Adran dragoons? It couldn’t be. If they were, the ranger\nwouldn’t be fleeing before them. Tamas looked over at Olem, but the\nbodyguard couldn’t see that far.\n“Dragoons,” Tamas shouted at him. “Chasing one of our rangers!\nThey’re wearing Adran blues, but they’re not friendly.”\nOlem responded by urging his mount harder.\nTamas put his head down and counted the beats of the hooves as they\nclosed the distance between themselves and the ranger. As he drew closer,\nhe was able to tell that the dragoons were perhaps a half mile behind the\nranger. The ranger’s horse frothed at the mouth, shaking its head hard. It\nwouldn’t last much longer.\nTamas waved his pistol at the ranger, motioning for him to stop. The\nranger’s horse shuddered and swayed, eyes rolling as the ranger reined in\nbeside Tamas. The ranger’s face and front were covered in dust, smeared\nand muddy from his sweat.\n“Where’s Gavril?” Tamas demanded.\nThe ranger gasped for breath, trying to speak, before he threw his hand\nout behind him. “Far… back… fought so I could… escape.”\n“Who are they?”\n“Kez! We thought they were friendlies, but they fell on us the moment\nGavril spoke in Adran.”\nTamas whirled toward the dragoons and quickly counted. Sixteen. They\nwaved their carbines and hollered, showing no sign of slowing at the sight\nof Tamas and Olem. They’d be upon him in minutes. He raised his off hand"

He raised his off hand\nto steady his pistol and closed one eye. He squeezed the trigger.\nIn his head, he counted seconds, concentrating on the powder, keeping\nthe bullet flying far beyond when it should have fallen. At the same time,\nhis hands worked to holster one pistol and draw the other.\nOne. Two. Thr…\nA dragoon near the rear of the group fell, the bullet taking him neatly in\nthe eye.\nTamas steadied his second pistol and fired. Another dragoon fell. Again,\nat the rear of the group. Tamas didn’t want to scare off the dragoons, and it\ndidn’t seem like they noticed their comrades’ fall.\n“Olem! With me!”\nTamas dug his heels in and spurred his horse forward. He holstered his\nsecond pistol and drew his heavy cavalry saber. It felt good in his grip, the\nold leather handle worn and strong.\nThe dragoons aimed their carbines at seventy yards. They fired, and\nTamas heard one bullet whistle past his ear.\nHitting a single riding target from horseback was difficult at best, if you\nweren’t a powder mage.\nHe cocked his saber back and eyed the lead dragoon. The man was\nmissing an ear. Earless stowed his carbine and drew his straight cavalry\nsword in one quick motion.\nHand still on the reins, Tamas dug into his front uniform pocket for a\nsmall handful of bullets.\nTamas studied the position of Earless’s sword, then ran his eyes over the\nnext few dragoons, all in a pair of seconds. Tamas leaned to his right,\nbringing his saber up high.\nThen they were upon each other.\nTamas slid to his left in the saddle, narrowly avoiding the stroke of\nEarless’s sword. His cavalry saber bit through soft flesh, the top three\ninches cleaving through Earless’s neck. Tamas worked a bullet up to the top\nof his fist and flicked it in the air with his thumb, burning powder from a\nspare charge to send it into the heart of the next dragoon. He followed\nthrough with his saber cut, bringing it over his horse’s head and deflecting\nthe stab from a dragoon on his left.\nHe flicked another bullet into the air and burned powder, sending it\nbackward and into Earless’s spine.\nBack over his mount’s head with his saber, Tamas sawed on the reins. A\ndragoon at the rear of the group leaned toward him with a savage slice.\nParry. Parry again.\nThe dragoon was fast, and skilled. Tamas flicked a bullet into the air,\nsending it into the dragoon’s shoulder. The dragoon dropped his sword,\nclutching at his arm, and Tamas rammed his saber into the man’s chest.\nTamas spun around, looking for the next enemy, only to see two of the\ndragoons surrender to Olem. In the distance to the south, puffs of powder\nsmoke rose from a pair of figures—Vlora and Andriya. Tamas rode to one\nof the surrendered dragoons.\n“Where is Gavril?” he said in Kez.\nThe dragoon stared back at him."

Where is he?”\nThe dragoon shook his head.\n“Pit.” Tamas cleaned and sheathed his sword. “Olem, with me!”\n“Sir, my horse is lame.” Olem was already dismounting. His horse was\nin a panic, blood streaming from a wound beneath its neck.\n“Then take one of theirs!”\n“The prisoners…”\n“Leave them! I’ll not lose another brother in this forsaken country!”\nTamas pushed on without waiting for an answer. A while later, he looked\nover his shoulder to see Olem and the powder mages struggling to keep up.\nThe sun set on the western horizon, bathing Tamas in twilight. He kept\non, the hot night air whipping his hair and jacket, drying the blood on his\ncheeks. His charger began to struggle, breathing hard, slowing despite his\ncontinued urging.\nOlem was lost to him as darkness spread on the plateau. The eerie sound\nof howling brush wolves reached his ears above the whistling of the wind.\nHis powder trance wore off, and he chewed another powder charge to bring\nit back again. The road passed in a blur and the pounding of hooves.\nHe did not know how far or how long he’d ridden when his charger\nstumbled. He jolted from the saddle, thrown for several feet, and landed\nhard on his shoulder.\nTamas staggered to his feet. Silence. Nothing in the night. No sound of\nhooves from his soldiers following. No sign or sound of dragoons. Just the\ndesperate gasping of his charger.\nWhere was Gavril? What had happened to him? Tamas ran a hand\nthrough his sweaty, dirty hair. His hat was gone, blown off he knew not\nwhen. He stumbled over to examine the horse, his legs wobbly from riding\ntoo long and too hard.\nThe charger lay on its side. It rolled its eyes at him, foam and blood at its\nnose and the corner of its mouth. Tamas blinked away tears and tried to\ncalm the beast with a hand on its flank. It twitched and tried to stand up,\nonly to let out a shuddering scream. The sound shook Tamas’s soul.\nThe horse’s leg had shattered, bone sticking out from the side. It must\nhave stepped in a hole and stumbled from exhaustion.\nTamas drew his pistol. He loaded it slowly, carefully.\nThe shot rang out across the plateau.\nTamas gathered his saddlebags, ammunition, pistols, and rifle. He began\nto walk north.\nHe didn’t know when he’d stopped. Only that he was suddenly on his\nknees, staring at his hands. They were raw from the reins. Where had his\nriding gloves gone? He shook his head and thought to stand and keep going.\nInstead, he dropped his head into his hands. Another brother. All that\nremained of his family gone except, perhaps, his son. Tamas had failed\nagain.\nHe should have stopped. Interrogated those Kez dragoons. Found out if\nGavril was even alive, and where they’d taken him. How many dragoons in\ntheir company."

How many dragoons in\ntheir company.\nTamas knew he’d been a fool, riding on like that. A desperate fool,\ntrying to save his brother. Alone.\nTamas wept.\nThe tears were dry when Tamas heard hoofbeats on the road. They came\non at a steady canter from the south. One set, from the sound of things.\n“Tamas?” a female voice called.\nVlora.\nShe shouted his name again. The hoofbeats grew closer, then stopped.\nThe crunch of gravel as she leapt from her horse. Then hands on his\nshoulders, shaking him.\n“Sir, please. Answer me. Tamas!”\nTamas took a long breath, holding it for several beats before letting it\nout.\n“I’m here.” His voice surprised him, coming out a whispered croak.\nHe felt something forced into his hands. He looked down. A canteen. He\ntook a sip.\n“Your horse…”\n“Broke its leg,” Tamas said. “I had to put it down.”\n“I know. I saw it. Almost two miles back. You kept walking, all this\nway?”\n“Poor creature. Died because I wouldn’t stop.”\nVlora put her cool hand on the back of his neck. “Drink more.”\n“Couldn’t find Gavril,” Tamas said. “Tried. Couldn’t. Failed again.\nAnother brother, gone. My last. I…” He felt the tears coming again and\nstopped to take several deep breaths. “Where’s Olem?”\n“His horse threw a shoe nearly fifteen miles ago.”\n“Fifteen miles…”\nVlora took his face in her hands, forcing him to look up at her. He\nwondered what she saw then, in his eyes. A broken old man, dirty from the\nroad?\n“Tamas,” Vlora said, “you rode nearly forty miles. It will be dawn in an\nhour.”\nTamas blinked the tears out of his eyes and looked up. It felt like he was\nlooking at a different world. The moon was high overhead, the stars bright.\nShe examined him for several moments. He knew she could see that he\nwas low on powder and ammunition. He’d dropped his rifle at some point.\nBut not the pistols. Not the ones Taniel had given him. No, he wouldn’t\nleave those behind for the world. Taniel—his boy—had given them to him.\nTamas struggled to his feet, letting Vlora take some of his weight. He\nlooked north. Forty miles. He was in Deliv now. Closer to Alvation than he\nwas to his own army.\nFoolish. Bloody foolish of him.\nVlora went to her horse and began unloading her saddle.\n“What are you doing?”\n“We’re camping here,” Vlora said.\n“I’ve got to return…”\n“Don’t be stupid, Tamas. The army will catch up in two days. If you\nkeep going tonight, you’ll be utterly useless when we reach Alvation.”\nShe was right, of course. Not that he liked it.\nHe drew himself up. “I’m your—”"

I know. Here’s a bedroll. I’ll take first watch.”\nTamas looked down at the bedroll thrust into his hands, then up at the\nmoon, and finally to the north, where Alvation sat somewhere in the\ndarkness, just off the edge of the plateau.\n“Another brother,” he heard himself say again. “Another.”\nCHAPTER\n34\nT\namas didn’t wake until the heat of the noonday sun finally drove him out\nof a restless sleep. He sat up suddenly, looking down stupidly at the hat in\nhis lap. He lifted it, turned it around. It wasn’t his. Far too small.\nVlora. She was gone, and Tamas wondered if her coming to find him the\nnight before had been just a fevered dream.\n“She went looking for water for the horses, sir.”\nTamas looked behind him. Olem sat on a rock, carefully cleaning his\ncarbine. He had saddlebags and canteens. Tamas rolled his tongue around\ninside his mouth. It felt dry and hot, his tongue two sizes too big.\n“Canteen,” Tamas said.\nOlem tossed him a canteen and Tamas drank hungrily.\n“When did you catch up?”\n“Just after dawn,” Olem said. He was looking at Tamas strangely. “You\ndon’t look so well, sir.”\nTamas ran his hand through what was left of his hair and gingerly felt\nalong the stitches in his scalp. “Lost my hat last night.”\n“Ah.” Olem’s gaze seemed to say, What, we’re not going to mention you\nrode off like a madman last night? What the pit is wrong with you?\nTamas looked away. “There’s not much water on this damned plateau.”\n“We passed an old river bed in the night,” Olem said. “I couldn’t tell if\nthere was anything in the bottom. Vlora has gone to check.”\nTamas got to his feet and walked a few circles around the camp. He felt\nawful. His legs were sore and cramped—especially his bad one—his crotch\nchafed, his face wind-burned and hands raw. He had a pounding headache,\nfrom too little water and too little rest. Every time he stopped his circuit, he\ncouldn’t help but look north, toward Alvation, then again to the south.\nVlora returned an hour later with the horses and full waterskins.\nLate in the afternoon, they were joined by the rest of the powder mages\nand ten of Olem’s Riflejacks. Not long after that, several of the rangers\ncaught up with them. Tamas immediately sent them out scouting to the\nnorth.\nLate in the day, Tamas saw riders on the northern horizon, miles off.\nThey never came closer, but Tamas could see they were wearing blue\nuniforms with silver trim. Who were these impostors? Were they Kez, as he\nsuspected?\nThe army reached Tamas by late the next day.

        "text": "suspected?\nThe army reached Tamas by late the next day. They pitched camp there,\nand Tamas’s first order of business was to find the Kez dragoons he’d\nfought two days earlier.\nThere were three of them. They were a ragged lot, their horses, weapons,\nsupplies, and helmets confiscated. Their faces were burned from the sun.\nOne of them walked with a heavy limp, and dried blood on his trousers said\nthe wound was recent. Another was missing two front teeth.\nThe third was missing his boots. He’d wrapped the bloody remnants of\nhis jacket around his feet.\nOne of their guards pointed at the man with his jacket wrapped around\nhis feet. His white undershirt was stained brown and yellow from sweat and\nblood. He had short brown hair and large muttonchops. “That’s their\nlieutenant,” the guard said. “That’s what his jacket said, before he tore it.”\n“Where are his boots?” Tamas asked.\n“Took them away,” the guard said. “To try to get him to talk.”\nTamas sighed. “Go find them. No way to treat an officer, even a prisoner\nof war.” He turned to the lieutenant and spoke to him in his own language:\n“What is your name?”\nThe man stared past Tamas.\n“Tell me your name, and I’ll give you your boots back.”\n“What?” the man said with a thick Adran accent. “I don’t speak Kez.”\nTamas rolled his eyes. “I know you’re a Kez officer. Keep pretending to\nbe Adran and I’ll have you shot for desertion.” He leaned forward. “I can do\nthings to my own men that I can’t do to a prisoner of war.”\nThe man’s eyes flicked to Tamas. He flinched. “Lieutenant Mernoble,”\nhe said. “The King’s Thirty-Fourth Dragoons.”\n“What are you doing here, Mernoble?” Tamas asked. “We are in Deliv.”\n“Weren’t in Deliv when you caught us,” Mernoble said.\n“You came from the north. The only thing north at the time was Deliv.”\nMernoble returned his gaze to the spot over Tamas’s shoulder and didn’t\nspeak. A few moments later, the guard returned with Mernoble’s boots.\nTamas took them and handed them over to Mernoble.\nMernoble took the boots. “With your leave?”\nTamas nodded.\nMernoble sat on the ground and gingerly unwrapped his feet. Tamas\nwinced at the sight. The lieutenant’s socks were torn and soaked with blood,\nhis feet raw. It looked like he’d been walking without boots for miles. He\nslipped the boots on carefully, unable to suppress a groan when he returned\nto his feet.\n“Have they been given water?” Tamas asked. When the guard didn’t\nanswer, Tamas turned to him. “Well? Water, or food?”\nThe guard shook his head.\n“Damn it, man, go get them food. They’re soldiers, just like you.”\nThe guard scurried off.\n“He’s getting you some food,” Tamas said in Kez.\nMernoble nodded gratefully.\n“Why were you in Deliv?” Tamas asked again.\nMernoble took a deep breath and returned to staring past Tamas."

Hard.\n“Come with me,” Tamas said. To one of the other guards, “Where is\nGeneral Beon’s tent?”\n“Are you sure that’s wise, sir?” The guard seemed confused.\n“What do you mean, man? Where is the general’s tent?”\n“Just over there.”\nTamas walked through the camp until he found Beon sitting beside a low\nfire of twigs and old horse dung. The general struggled to stand when he\nsaw Tamas. At the sight of the prisoner, his eyes narrowed.\n“General Beon,” Tamas said, “I have gathered by your demeanor that\nyou would be greatly interested in knowing who has been burning, raping,\nand robbing their way through the bean farms on the plateau.”\n“I would,” Beon said. His tone was icy. “I discovered it last night, in\nfact. These men are Kez officers, pretending to be Adran.” He looked down\nat Mernoble’s feet. “Who gave him back his boots?”\nTamas looked from Beon to Mernoble. The lieutenant’s eyes were wide\nwith fear, and suddenly Tamas understood. It had been Beon who ordered\nMernoble’s boots taken away. Likely, he’d ordered the lieutenant be left\nunfed as well. Tamas’s own men would have been more than happy to go\nalong with it. “I did.”\n“I demand that this man’s boots be removed, and that you organize a\nfiring squad. I want these men executed tomorrow morning for crimes\nagainst the people of Kez.”\nTamas bit back a reply. He’d not be ordered around by a prisoner, even if\nhe did respect Beon. Instead, he turned to Mernoble. “It seems time to\nexplain yourself, Lieutenant.”\nMernoble’s hands were shaking. “What would you like to know?”\n“Everything,” Beon said. For his youth, his demeanor was commanding.\nTamas put a hand on Mernoble’s shoulder. “First, tell me where Gavril\nis. He was a big man. Captured by your unit two days ago, before you\nchased my ranger back to my camp.”\n“They took him back to Alvation,” Mernoble said.\n“Alive?”\n“Yes.”\nTamas let out a small sigh. That was the first thing he needed to know.\nNow to find out the rest.\n“Is that all, sir?”\n“No. Start with your brigade,” Tamas said.\n“I am with the Thirty-Fourth Dragoons, attached to the Nineteenth\nBrigade of His Majesty’s Grand Army,” Mernoble said. “We were sent\nnorth…”\n“Who?” Tamas asked. “How many?”\n“Two brigades. The Nineteenth and the Twenty-Fourth. We were sent\nnorth seven weeks ago with the aim of capturing the Deliv city of\nAlvation.”\n“For what purpose?” Tamas asked. Now was his chance to ask\nquestions. This man might clam up once he realized how his answers\nbenefited the enemy."

        "text": "Alvation.”\n“For what purpose?” Tamas asked. Now was his chance to ask\nquestions. This man might clam up once he realized how his answers\nbenefited the enemy.\n“So that we could besiege the Mountainwatch above Alvation. We were\nto take Alvation, then the Mountainwatch, then come over the Charwood\nPile and down into Adro.”\n“And the uniforms?” Tamas asked.\n“A ruse. To make the Deliv think that an Adran army had sacked\nAlvation.”\nTamas’s breath caught in his throat. If the Kez attacked Deliv while\nmasquerading as Adran, it might force Deliv into the war on the Kez side.\n“Have you succeeded?”\nMernoble looked at Beon, but only got an icy stare for the effort. “We\ntook Alvation,” he said. “About a week and a half ago. The Mountainwatch\ncommander saw through our disguise, so we haven’t entered Adro yet. The\nMountainwatch is under siege.”\n“How do you explain this treatment of my people, Lieutenant?” Beon\nasked. “Of our people?”\n“I’m not proud of it, sir,” Mernoble said, casting his eyes downward.\n“When we left the Grand Army, we were ordered to travel lightly and\nquickly. Live off the land with a limited supply caravan. Conscript as\nneeded. The order came from His Majesty himself. When we found the\nAdran rangers, we were on a scouting mission, looking for more food and\nconscripts.”\n“My father sanctioned this treatment?” Beon growled the question.\nMernoble nodded.\n“Who is the general in charge of the Nineteenth?”\n“It was Field Marshal—I mean, General Tine,” Mernoble said.\nGeneral, after being demoted because of his failure to take the South\nPike Mountainwatch. “Was?” Tamas asked. Tine was a capable commander,\nbut pragmatic and often cavalier with his men’s lives. Tamas would not\nhave been surprised to see him act in this manner.\n“He was hanged, sir. For treason.”\n“Hanged?” Beon said.\n“That’s what I heard, sir. And I saw the body. Last week.”\n“He was a general,” Tamas said. “The orders would have had to come\nstraight from Ipille.” He stepped away, taking a deep breath of the evening\nair. This was strange. Very strange. Ipille was a tyrant, but he was no idiot.\nHe wouldn’t have wanted to provoke war with Deliv.\nTamas returned to the pair. “Who the pit would convince Ipille it’s a\ngood idea to attack Alvation?”\n“I don’t know sir, I…”\n“Yes?”\n“Well, I’m not privy to that information, but I had heard rumors.”\n“Go on.”\n“It was the Privileged.”\n“What Privileged?” Tamas felt his hackles rise. Most of the Kez Cabal\nhad died on South Pike, or so he’d been told.\n“Rumors were he came out of Adro. His Majesty’s own envoy. Only\ntook him two days to convince His Majesty to attack Deliv.”\nTamas put his hands on Mernoble’s shoulders, feeling suddenly\ndesperate. “His name, damn it. What was it?”\n“He’s the same that hanged Field Marshal Tine. The same in Alvation\nright now.”"

He’d not\nseen Ricard since that afternoon when Adamat had spotted Brudania-Gurla\nTrading Company ships coming down the canal lock system. Ricard had\ninsisted on going to find out what the devil was going on, while Adamat\nhad taken his family back to Adopest right away.\nHe feared that Ricard had been captured.\nAdamat tried to remind himself that he had far too little information with\nwhich to make informed decisions. Perhaps there was another explanation\nfor the Trading Company ships. But his mind kept going back to one thing:\nAdro had been invaded by Brudania.\nIt was as if all of Adamat’s nightmares were coming true. Claremonte\nwas bringing the might of the Trading Company fleet down on Adopest.\nWith the entire army tied up against the Kez in southern Adro, the capital\ncity was completely defenseless. The Mountainwatch had been muscled out\nof defending the canal by Ricard himself. There was absolutely nothing to\nstop Claremonte from sailing down the Ad River and taking the city.\nHow long had Claremonte been planning this? He must have quietly\ncaptured the lock system weeks ago, and bribed the Deliv navy to let him\nsail his fleet up the canal from the ocean.\nWhat did Claremonte want with Adro? To conquer it? Did he want their\nresources? Was the Brudania-Gurla Trading Company in the employ of the\nKez? Or were they operating on their own? Adamat found the latter thought\nsomehow more terrifying than the former. If both Brudania and Kez wanted\nAdro, Adopest would be torn apart between them.\nHe had to get his family out of the city. Who knew what an occupying\narmy would do?\nBut where to go?\nThey were trapped. One army to the south, one to the north.\nHe could send them to Novi. Adamat didn’t know anyone in Novi.\nPerhaps he could…\nThere was a knock on the door. Adamat snatched the pistol from his\ndesk and took a sip of wine before heading to the front hallway.\n“Stay upstairs,” he said when he saw Astrit looking curiously down from\nthe landing.\nHe opened the door to find a servant there.

There’s a\ncarriage waiting.”\n“He’s back?”\n“Arrived less than an hour ago, sir,” the servant said.\nCould this be a trap? Were agents of Lord Claremonte there now,\nwaiting to kill Adamat when he showed his face? Or was Adamat just being\nparanoid? “Did he say anything else?”\n“No, sir. Just requested your presence.”\n“I’ll be a moment.”"

The sun shone down between the rooftops, and Faye had\nher head tilted back, face to the light, her book sitting in her lap.\n“Love,” Adamat said gently.\nFaye jumped. The book slid from her grasp, and she put a hand to her\nchest.\n“Don’t sneak up on me like that,” she said. “Was someone at the door?”\nAdamat fetched the book and gave it back to her. “Yes. A messenger\nfrom Ricard. He’s asked to see me.”\n“Well?”\n“I want you to go to Novi,” he said.\n“I will not.”\n“Please, no more arguing.” They’d fought the entire trip back from the\nnorth over what she and the children should do. She wanted to stay in the\ncity. He wanted her to get out. “You’ll be safer in Novi.”\n“Just like I was safer in Nafolk?” she asked, bristling.\n“Faye…”\n“Don’t ‘Faye’ me,” she said. “We’ll stay together. No more sending us\noff for our own good. Me. The children. We’re not going anywhere.”\nAdamat opened his mouth to protest, but couldn’t think of what to say.\nHe wasn’t going to win, he knew that, but he still wanted to fight. Couldn’t\nshe see it was better for her to be somewhere safe?\nAdamat leaned forward to kiss the top of her head. “I’m going to see\nwhat Ricard has to say,” he said.\nCHAPTER\n35\nT\naniel crossed the no-man’s-land between the Adran and Kez armies under\nthe cover of dark.\nHe supposed he could have done it during the day. He’d walked unseen\nthrough the Adran camp just to try out Mihali’s spell. It worked. But some\ndeep reservation kept him from trusting Mihali completely.\nHe arrived just after midnight. There were sentries stationed a half mile\nout from the Kez camp. If the Kez operated anything like the Adran army,\nmany of the sentries would be Knacked—men who could see in the dark or\nhear quiet noises and had the third eye. Taniel had forgotten to ask if the\nspell worked against the third eye.\nOr if he made sounds when he walked.\nHe stopped a few dozen yards from the closest sentry and poured a\nmeasure of black powder across the back of his hand. A single, long snort\nand the powder was gone.\nTaniel dusted off his nose and crouched in a shallow streambed. There\nwasn’t much cover to speak of in the valley. What little brush there was had\nbeen stripped by the Adran camp for burning or to make space for tents or\njust because soldiers got bored. Taniel could smell that a latrine had been\ndug nearby.\nHe measured the space between the two closest sentries. Fifty paces,\ngive or take. He headed for the gap.\nA twig snapped beneath his foot, and one of the sentries turned toward\nTaniel.\n“Password!” the sentry demanded in Kez."

He headed for the gap.\nA twig snapped beneath his foot, and one of the sentries turned toward\nTaniel.\n“Password!” the sentry demanded in Kez.\nThe sentry waited for a few moments. The barrel of his musket wavered,\nand he squinted into the dark.\n“Powell?” the sentry called. “Powell!”\n“Heh?”\nThe reply came from less than ten feet away. Taniel could feel his heart\nbeating in his throat.\n“You see anyone out there?”\n“What kind of fool question is that? I’d a-raised the alarm if I did.”\n“I thought I heard something. Coulda been a spy.”\n“Idiot. If it was a spy, he knows I’m here now.”\n“Oh.” The first sentry seemed pleased with himself. “Then we scared\nhim off, did we?”\n“By Kresimir, you’re daft. Just watch the night.”\nTaniel skirted the spot he’d heard the voice come from. Even with his\nMarked eyesight he couldn’t make out a figure in the darkness. The sentry\nmust have been damned good at hiding.\nTaniel passed a few dozen more sentries without incident and then he\nwas in the heart of the Kez camp. He wasn’t sure when Mihali’s sorcerous\ninvisibility would cease, so he did his best to keep low as he crept through\nthe camp.\nIt was desolate. In the Adran camp there was always someone awake.\nMen telling stories or women doing laundry, no matter the hour. The fires\nwere kept going most of the night, and there was always the hum of quiet\nvoices. The Kez camp, however…\nThe tents were in perfectly straight lines, giving Taniel good vision\ndown the aisles. He didn’t spot a soul for five minutes, when he finally\ncaught sight of a squad of Kez guards. They marched double-time through\nthe center of the camp, eyes straight ahead, muskets held over their heads. It\nlooked more like they were being punished than that they were on guard\nduty.\nTaniel avoided the few patrols and made his way toward the rear of the\ncamp. It wasn’t hard to find his objective.\nThe command tent was as big as a city administration building and was\nmade up of a dozen smaller tents. Guards were posted at even intervals\naround the entire tent complex. Light shone through the walls, and Taniel’s\nMarked hearing could make out the sound—if not the words themselves—\nof heated argument.\nSomeone was still up. That suited Taniel fine.\nHe hunkered down behind a soldier’s tent and watched the main\nentrance. He didn’t need anything fancy. Just someone who’d know their\nway around the Kez camp. A high-ranking officer would be the best.\nIt didn’t take long before whatever argument had been taking place died\ndown. Five minutes later, officers began exiting the tent.\nTaniel watched them go, noting what direction they went.\nA major. Another major. A colonel—good. A general. Even better.\nHe shifted in his hiding spot, ready to follow the general at a distance,\nwhen someone else caught his eye.\nTaniel recognized the man.

Field Marshal Goutlit—Tine’s replacement.\nTamas had always referred to Goutlit as a competent bureaucrat, a man who\nthought of losses as nothing more than numbers on paper and had no\nqualms about sending ten thousand men to their deaths if it would win him\neven a trivial victory.\nGoutlit immediately headed south, toward the rear of the Kez camp. One\nof the guards broke off from the command tent and followed.\nSo did Taniel.\nGoutlit’s sleeping quarters was a farmhouse only a few hundred yards\nfrom the command tent. The field marshal went inside while the guard took\nup a station beside the front door.\nTaniel rounded the farmhouse once. Two windows, both with shutters\nfastened tight. No other door but the front.\nHe pressed himself up against the wall of the farmhouse and crept back\naround to the front. A hand over the guard’s mouth and a knife between the\nribs and into the man’s left lung was enough to keep him from making\nnoise. Taniel removed the knife and rammed it into the guard’s heart, then\nslowly lowered the body to the ground.\n“Pouli,” Goutlit called from inside. “Get in here.”\nThe door creaked when it opened. The farmhouse was dark but for a\nlight coming from the only other room.\n“Pouli,” Goutlit said from the other room. “They didn’t bring the girl I\nasked for. Damned quartermasters can’t do a thing right. Go and fetch her\nthis instant. It’s late enough as it is, I want to be asleep in half an hour.”\nTaniel grabbed the dead guard by the belt and dragged him inside, then\nclosed the door.\n“I said this instant, man. If I have to—”\nGoutlit came out of his room carrying a lantern. He was a balding man\nof medium height and square shoulders and a strong gaze. He’d removed\nhis jacket and was shaking his head, obviously in a bout of anger. He froze\nwhen he saw the body of his guard.\nTaniel was on him in a moment, bloody knife in one hand, the other\npressing over Goutlit’s mouth to cut off a strangled cry.\n“Shh,” Taniel said. “Quiet now, or I cut out your heart.” He waved the\nknife in front of Goutlit’s eyes. “This is how it works: If you call out, I kill\nyou. If you try to run, I kill you. I’m faster and stronger than you and I\nwon’t hesitate. Do you understand?”\nBehind Taniel’s hand, Goutlit whispered, “I only speak Kez.”\n“Don’t lie to me. I met you years ago at a ball thrown by Manhouch and\nyou spoke Adran fine. Now tell me, do you understand?”\nGoutlit inhaled sharply. “Yes.”\nTaniel stepped away from Goutlit, but watched him carefully out of the\ncorner of his eye. He checked outside the door. No alarm. No one\nsuspicious that the guard was not at his post.\n“Can you see me?”\n“What?” Goutlit said. “Of course.”\nSo Mihali’s invisibility was gone for certain."

I have money. I can make you a rich man.”\n“I don’t care about your money,” Taniel said. “I won’t kill you if you\ncooperate.”\nGoutlit, Taniel remembered his father saying, was not a brave man. His\nstrength was arithmetic. He stayed as far from the fighting as possible and\nonly engaged the enemy when he had overwhelming force.\n“I will not betray my country,” Goutlit said, chin up.\nTaniel left the dead guard and pounced on Goutlit. The man let out a\nhigh whimper and tried to press himself into his chair. “If you don’t help\nme, I won’t think any more about snuffing out your life than you would of\nkilling a mouse in your pantry.”\nAnother whimper.\n“No need to betray anything,” Taniel said. “No one will ever question\nyour loyalty. Though you may want to come up with some reason as to why\nPouli here wound up dead.” Taniel left Goutlit, smelling mildly like piss, in\nhis chair and finished getting Pouli’s boots off and then took the man’s\npants and jacket. They’d be a bit too big, but they’d have to do.\n“Tell me about Kresimir,” Taniel said.\nGoutlit remained silent.\n“The god,” Taniel said roughly, “living in your camp. Where is he?”\n“He’s living in the old keep. About a mile south of here. He was in\nBudwiel, living in the mayor’s mansion, but two days ago it was destroyed\nby Adran sorcery.”\nTaniel chuckled. “Adran sorcery, huh? Does the General Staff believe\nthat?”\nGoutlit licked his lips. Enough of an answer.\n“So he’s in Midway Keep?”\nGoutlit said, “That’s it.”\n“Guards?”\n“Prielights.”\nElite guards of the Kresim Church. As far as Taniel knew, the Church\nhad made no public proclamation about the war. It seemed like they were\nready to defend their god, though. “How many?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“Inside or out?”\n“Both.”\n“Does Kresimir ever come into the camp?”\nGoutlit shook his head. “Never. We always go to him.”\n“Is it true he wears a mask with no right eyehole?”\n“Yes.”\nTaniel tongued his teeth. Interesting.\n“Who are you?” Goutlit asked as Taniel put on the dead guard’s pants.\nTaniel tightened his belt. “Change your pants. You smell like piss. And\nget your jacket.”\nGoutlit’s hands shook as he changed his clothes. Taniel watched, just to\nbe sure the man wouldn’t try to slip out a window.\nTaniel spotted the liquor cabinet in the corner.

Taniel cringed and listened for any voices outside the\nfarmhouse. Nothing.\n“You’re him, aren’t you?” Goutlit asked.\n“Who?”\n“The eye behind the flintlock. Taniel Two-Shot.”\nTaniel felt his chest grow cold. So. The rumors Mihali had heard were\ntrue. Kresimir was looking for him. “Let’s go,” Taniel said, shouldering the\nguard’s musket. “Remember—any false word or movement and you are a\ndead man.”\nGoutlet straightened his jacket. The whiskey seemed to have given him\ncourage. “What do you want of me?”\nTaniel opened the front door. The god was coughing blood at night,\nMihali had said.\n“You’re going to help me steal Kresimir’s bedsheets.”\nCHAPTER\n36\nA\nre you sure this is wise, sir?” Olem asked. “We’re awfully close to the\ncity.”\nTamas gazed through his looking glass at the city of Alvation. It was an\nunwalled city, spilling along the north side of a shallow river that flowed\nfrom the northeast and wound along the Northern Expanse. Most of the\nbuildings were two or three stories, smoke rising from their chimneys, with\nstone-shingled roofs. It was a major intersection of the Great Northern\nHighway and the Charwood Pass—a Mountainwatch toll road that took\ntrade up over the Charwood Pile and into Adro.\nHe guessed Alvation to number around a hundred thousand souls. Not as\nlarge a city as those in the south of Kez or on the coast of Deliv, but not a\nsmall one, by any means.\n“No, not entirely,” Tamas answered.\nOlem lay at Tamas’s side. Vlora on his left. Behind him, the rest of his\npowder mages made camp in an abandoned farmhouse while Tamas, Olem,\nand Vlora crouched in a dry irrigation ditch and observed the city from\nthree miles out.\nAn abandoned farmhouse. This close to the city. Something was surely\nwrong here.\n“I don’t see any sign of the Kez army,” Olem said.\n“There.” Vlora pointed. “Do you see where the Charwood Pass first\nenters the city from the west? A little way east of that. Blue-and-silver\nuniforms. The Kez impostors.” Vlora was in a powder trance, like Tamas\nhimself. They’d both be able to see farther and clearer than Olem.\nTamas searched until he found the spot she’d indicated. A group of some\nfifty soldiers moved through the stalls of an open market, pointing and\nshouting. They had several large carts and were filling them from the\nvendors’ stalls.\n“Nikslaus is bleeding the city for all they’ve got,” Tamas said. “Sending\nhis men out to collect a tax.”\nTamas traced the outside of the city with his looking glass, then to where\nthe city met the Charwood Pass.

Tamas spotted\nbarrels, carts, horses.\n“I sense a lot of powder in the city,” Vlora said.\n“There’s an army camped there.”\n“More than usual.”\nTamas didn’t know what that could mean. Perhaps the Deliv had been\nstockpiling powder here in preparation for a war with Kez or Adro.\n“Interesting.”\nVlora said, “At the base of the mountain. Looks like their headquarters\nfor besieging the Mountainwatch.”\n“I see it,” Tamas said.\n“Where the pit is the Deliv army?” Olem asked.\nTamas continued to examine the city. It was a question he’d asked\nhimself a few times. “King Sulam might be gathering an army even now. Or\nNikslaus took the city fast enough that word hasn’t yet reached Sulam.” It\nwas a possibility he didn’t want to consider. The Deliv had a proud history\nof having a swift, efficient army—even if their current one was rather\noutdated. “Likely, Nikslaus plans on being over the mountains before Sulam\nresponds. Then he can pin it on the Adran army and bring Deliv into the\nwar.”\nOlem said, “They’re occupying the city, sir. The people have to know\nthat it’s Kez soldiers in disguise.” He chewed on his fingernails—he’d been\ndoing that ever since smoking his last cigarette.\n“I don’t know,” Tamas said. “Nikslaus isn’t an idiot. He’ll think of\nsomething.”\n“Should we bring the army forward? Call for an attack?” Olem asked.\n“If we position at night, we may be able to blindside them.”\n“If they don’t already know we’re here.” Tamas cursed quietly under his\nbreath. “They’ve got Gavril, remember?” The city had no walls, which\nmade it easier to take without artillery, but the Kez were entrenched. They\nhad all the supplies, and knew the lay of the land. Urban warfare would be\nchaos.\n“Sir,” Vlora said. “Look at the church steeple near the center of the city.”\nTamas scanned along until he found the church.\n“Above the bell tower,” Vlora said.\nTamas took a sharp breath. Above the bell tower of an old stone Kresim\nchurch hung dozens of bodies. Men, women, white Kez, and black Deliv.\nChildren. He felt his stomach turn, and for a moment Sabon’s dead face\nflashed before him.\n“Bloody Nikslaus,” Tamas said.\n“Should we go back, sir?”\n“Back?”\n“To the army. We’ll have to come up with something to take the Kez by\nsurprise.”\nTamas examined the bell tower again, then the city as a whole. He ran\nhis gaze along the tops of the buildings, considering angles of attack. He\nwould have to get his men close to the city under cover of night, then cross\nthe shallow river and catch as many of the Kez out in the open as they\ncould.\nThe best he could hope for in that situation, even if the Deliv rose up and"

And\nhe couldn’t afford that, not with thirty thousand Kez infantry still coming on\nfrom the south.\n“Congratulations, Olem. You’ve just been promoted to colonel.”\n“Sir?” Olem’s mouth hung open.\n“I need someone to head back and give commands to the Seventh and\nNinth, and they’re not going to take it from a captain.”\n“But sir, the ranks?”\n“I think we can skip ‘major’ and all that.”\n“Thank you, sir, but I think—”\nTamas held up a hand to forestall any protestations.\n“I have things to do, Olem.

Then, and only then, we’ll\ngo to battle.”\nNila sat beside Jakob’s bed and listened to the soft sound of his snores. The\nboy’s chest rose and fell slowly, his face peaceful. It reminded her of the\ncherubs she’d once seen painted on the ceiling of a church. Outside the\nopen window she could hear the sound of a carriage clattering by on the\ncobbles.\nThey’d moved from Bo’s apartment in the factory district to a small\nhouse in one of the few fashionable areas of High Talien, in Adopest’s\nnorthwest side. From what Bo had said, he had several such “safe houses”\nscattered around the city. She had wondered at one point where he had\ngotten the money for all this before remembering that he was a member of\nthe Adran royal cabal.\nIt was easy to forget, sometimes. Cabal Privileged were known for their\ncruelty and power. Not for their quiet humor, flirting smiles, and silent\ngenerosity.\nBut he was leaving tomorrow. Heading south, he’d said, to rescue Taniel\nTwo-Shot.\nNila would find herself alone once again, sole guardian to the little boy\nsleeping before her. What was she going to do with him? Go to Fatrasta? To\nNovi? Live out the quiet life of a single laundress and tell everyone that\nJakob was her little brother?\nWould Jakob be able to live with that as he grew older? After all, he’d\nbeen a duke’s son. Not more than a couple of months ago there had been the\nvery real possibility of him becoming king. She would have been his\ncaretaker and surrogate mother, maybe even a noblewoman by decree of the\nnew king. She would have had wealthy suitors and servants and actual\npower.\nHow life would have been different.\nBut it wasn’t.\nNow she had to figure out where they would go when Bo left the city. It\noccurred to her that the silver she’d buried in a graveyard outside the city\nmight not even still be there. Someone might have found it and taken it, and\nthen where would she be?

She didn’t want to think about it.\nShe heard the front door of the house open and shut, and her heart beat\nfaster until she reminded herself that they were under Bo’s protection—at\nleast for another day—and that Lord Vetas could no longer harm them.\nBo stepped into the room, treading quietly. He knew that Jakob went to\nbed by eight in the evening. He gestured for her to join him in the kitchen.\n“Can the boy watch himself for a few hours?” Bo asked after she’d\nclosed the door to Jakob’s room. The words were rushed, and his eyes were\nalight. He was excited about something.\nHe wanted to take her somewhere. Where could it be? She felt her\ncheeks grow a little warm. “Well, he’s sleeping. He might get scared if he\nwakes up and no one’s in the house with him.”\n“Can he read?”\n“A little.”\n“Good. Write him a note. I need your help. We’ll be back in just a few\nhours.”\n“I could wake him and take him with us.”\n“You won’t want him with us,” Bo said.\nNila felt her cheeks flush.\n“Not for that,” Bo said, giving her a lopsided smile.\nNila’s cheeks felt on fire. Was that disappointment in the pit of her\nstomach?\nShe suddenly wondered how young Bo really was. He seemed so\nconfident, and his status as an Adran Cabal member made her think of him\nas quite a bit older, but there were times he looked barely twenty.\n“Come on,” Bo said.\nShe wrote a note for Jakob and left it on the kitchen table beside a glass\nof water, then joined Bo in the carriage. He pounded on the roof, and they\nwere off.\n“Do you know what you’re going to do when I leave?” Bo asked as the\ncarriage jostled along through the streets.\nNila looked down. She had hoped that, perhaps, he would stay a little\nlonger. “I haven’t decided yet.”\n“I can’t imagine you have much money,” Bo said.\n“A little. I have some silver buried outside of the city that I took the\nnight Tamas’s soldiers came to the Eldaminse house. I hope it’s still there.”\n“And if it’s not?”\nNila swallowed. “I don’t know.”\nThey rode along for several moments in silence, and then, “I’ll leave a\ncouple hundred for you when I go,” Bo said.\nA couple hundred could buy her and Jakob passage to Novi, or pay for a\nweek in an inn.\n“Thank you,” Nila said, not sure what else to say. “That will go a long\nway toward helping us start a new life.”\n“A long way? It should go the whole way.”\nNila frowned at Bo.\n“A couple hundred thousand krana?”\n“Hundred thousand…” Nila sputtered. She and Jakob could live the rest\nof their lives comfortably off a couple hundred thousand krana. “What, why\nwould you…?”\nBo waved a hand as if it were nothing.

I’ve already put the title in your name.”\nShe couldn’t help but stare at Bo. Who was this man? Why was he doing\nthis? He was a Privileged of a royal cabal—some of the most powerful men\nin all the Nine. People like that didn’t take notice of orphan boys or lonely\nlaundresses.\n“Why?” she asked.\nBo shrugged. Several moments passed before Nila realized that she\nwasn’t going to get a real answer. She dried the tears in the corners of her\neyes and took a deep breath, letting it out slowly.\n“Thank you,” she said.\nBo was looking at his feet. He seemed uncomfortable with the thanks, as\nif he didn’t feel he deserved it. Another shrug.\n“Where are we going?” Nila asked.\n“When I was a boy,” Bo said, apparently happy to change the subject—\nhe lifted his finger to the carriage curtain to look at the darkening sky\noutside—“Field Marshal Tamas took me in off the streets. He didn’t want\nTaniel playing with an uneducated ruffian. He gave me a place to sleep and\nhired tutors for me and Taniel.”\nNila remembered watching Field Marshal Tamas sleep, her knife ready\nto kill the man who’d brought so much suffering to Adro and killed the\nking, before she’d been distracted by Captain Olem. “That seems very kind\nof him,” she said.\n“I hated those damn tutors. I abhorred reading and writing, but Tamas\ntold me I had to practice my letters. So I did. By copying all of his\ncorrespondence while he slept. His old ones, his new ones. Tamas kept all\nhis letters in a strongbox, the lock of which I picked easily.”\nNila couldn’t help but give a shocked laugh at that.\nBo smiled too. “I kept all the copies I made. Just in case. I’ve always\nbeen good at planning ahead. Part of being a successful street rat, I suppose.\nAnyway, in one of those letters, from when he was a young man, Tamas\ntalked about forcing the nobility out of the army in order to combat\ncorruption. It seems that many of the nobles were purchasing supplies with\ngovernment money and then selling them elsewhere in order to line their\nown pockets.”\n“And what does this have to do with me?” Nila asked. Bo had spoken at\nlength over the last week about his quest to find evidence of profiteering\namong the General Staff in order to exonerate Taniel Two-Shot after his\ncourt-martial. Nila was willing to help if she could, but it worried her to\nleave Jakob by himself.\n“Tamas’s letter mentioned one name in particular. Duke Eldaminse.”\nNila breathed in sharply.\n“We’re going to Duke Eldaminse’s manor,” Bo said. “Or what’s left of\nit, anyway.”\nNila hadn’t been back to the Eldaminse manor since the night the\nsoldiers had come and taken away Lord and Lady Eldaminse.

At best he’s in\nprison. At worst, he’s already dead. I need evidence to condemn the General\nStaff that court-martialed him, or I’m going to have to go down there and\nkill a lot of soldiers to get him out.” Bo scowled at his ungloved hands. “I’d\nrather not do that. So inconvenient.”\nThey arrived at the manor an hour later. The sun had set and the streets\nwere dark. Rows of city manor houses rose like ghosts of ages past out of\nthe shadows. Less than six months ago this street had been well lit and\nhome to dozens of noble families and hundreds of servants. Now the\nwindows were dark, the yards silent. A chill went up Nila’s spine at the\nsight of the Eldaminse manor. Even in the darkness she could tell that fire\nhad destroyed part of the roof, and one of the chimneys had collapsed.\n“Are you all right,” Bo asked. She felt his hand touch her shoulder. He\nwas wearing his Privileged’s gloves.\nNila cleared her throat. “Yes.”\nHe handed her a lantern and then lifted his own, lighting it with the snap\nof his fingers.\n“Thank you,” Nila said. The light illuminated the drive and threw the\nyard into deeper shadows. Somehow, it reassured her. “This way.”\nShe led him up the front drive and in through the main door. The grand\nhall had been ransacked. The paintings and sculptures were gone or\ndefaced, and the chandelier had been cut down and stripped of semiprecious\nstones. Someone had written illegible words on the wall with what might\nhave been feces. The house smelled like a farmyard.\n“What are we looking for?” she asked.\n“A safe,” Bo said. “Somewhere Eldaminse would have kept his\ncorrespondence and books.”\nNila lifted her lantern high and headed toward the stairs. “It’ll be gone\nalready. Everything of value has been looted.”\n“I have to try.”\nThe rest of the house looked much like the grand hall. The furniture was\nsmashed or missing, everything of value removed, the walls covered in\ngraffiti. Nila couldn’t help but feel sorrow at that. The house had once been\na happy place, full of life and riches. Jakob had once run down these halls,\nchasing the servants with a wooden musket. She was glad Bo had left the\nboy in his bed.\nThe duke’s office was on the second floor in the southeastern corner of\nthe house. The moment she entered the room, she knew they weren’t going\nto find anything. The room was covered in scorch marks, and part of the\nfloor and outer wall were missing. Someone had tried blowing open the safe\nwith gunpowder. They’d used a lot, by the looks of it. The duke’s desk had\nbeen reduced to splinters by the explosion."

The duke’s desk had\nbeen reduced to splinters by the explosion.\nShe pointed to the mangled lump of metal over a dozen paces from\nwhere the safe had once sat.\n“That’s it,” she said. “The duke’s safe.”\nBo stooped to examine the safe. Anything that had been inside it would\nhave been destroyed by the explosion, or stolen after. He kicked the metal,\nthen swore, hopping around the room on one foot while he held his toe.\n“Pit, pit, pit!” Bo stumbled toward the hole in the floor and Nila found\nherself grabbing him by the back of his jacket, pulling him back before he\ncould fall.\nHe let out an exasperated sigh. “Ten days of work and this was my best\nlead.” He dropped onto the floor, cross-legged. “Are you sure there’s\nnothing else?”\n“I was just a laundress,” Nila said. “I’ve only been in this office a couple\nof times, and I was always trying to think of a way to keep Eldaminse from\ntaking me to his bed.”\nBo pounded a fist on the floor. “Damn!”\n“Can’t you just go down south and…” She made a gesture with her\nhands.\n“And what? Magic Taniel out of whatever cell they’ve locked him in?\nIt’s a bit more involved than that.”\nNila sat on the floor next to Bo.\n“If I don’t have the evidence to convict the General Staff, I’ll have to use\nsorcery,” Bo said. “Well, I’ll start with bribes. Bribes might work, but\nthey’re notoriously unreliable. Someone is just as likely to take your money\nand then turn you in as they are to help you. If bribes don’t work, I’ll have\nto kill people. I don’t actually enjoy killing people, despite what some\nmight think of royal cabalists. And I certainly don’t want to kill Adran\nsoldiers. Taniel wouldn’t ever forgive me.”\nBo stared at the floor, looking angry and sad all at the same time.\n“Wait!” Nila got to her feet.\n“What…?”\n“I came in here once and Lord Eldaminse was kneeling by the fire.”\n“Most people do,” Bo said, his tone a little annoyed.\n“No. Eldaminse always sat by the fire. He had this great big chair.” Nila\nskirted the hole in the floor and approached the fireplace. “Right here. And\nhe never put the wood in himself. Always summoned a servant to do it. So\nwhen I saw him kneeling there, I thought it was strange.”\nBo was on his feet now, too. “A lockbox, you think? Hidden under the\nflagstones?”\n“Maybe,” Nila said. It had to be. It was all Bo had left, and Nila\nsuddenly found herself wanting him to find the answers he needed. She\ndropped to her knees beside the fireplace and began trying to squeeze her\nfingers between the cracks. She searched for a hidden switch or a recess she\ncould grab to move the stone. Nothing.\n“Move,” Bo said. He tugged on his Privileged’s gloves and raised his\nhands. Nila scrambled out of the way. The flagstone suddenly cracked, and"

The flagstone suddenly cracked, and\nthe pieces—each far bigger than Nila could have lifted herself—flew to the\nside. Bo grinned down at the floor. Beneath the flagstone, untouched by the\nexplosion that had destroyed the safe, was a small lockbox. She grabbed it\nby the straps on the sides and lifted it out.\nBo destroyed the lock with a flick of his gloved fingers and the lid\nsprang open. Inside were several leather-bound books, each about the size\nof a pocket ledger, and Nila realized that could very well be what they were.\nBo opened one of the books and flipped through it. The grin on his face\ngrew wider. “Yes,” he said. “This is exactly what I needed.” He dropped the\nbook back into the lockbox. Then he closed his eyes, hands flat on the lid of\nthe lockbox. He almost looked like he was praying.\nA thought occurred to Nila. “Bo,” she said.\n“Yes?” He didn’t open his eyes.\n“Won’t they arrest you when they find out who you are?”\n“More than likely.”\n“And won’t they kill you if you try to rescue Taniel with sorcery?”\nBo’s eyes opened. “Almost certainly. I’ll be right back.” He left the\nroom, hurrying like a man who had just realized he’d left the kettle on in the\nkitchen.\nNila listened to his footfalls down the hallway and then down the stairs.\nShe could hear the sound of his boots crunching on the gravel drive outside.\nShe was alone now, in this great manor that had once been her home.\nShe lifted her lantern and did a slow circuit of the duke’s office. Several\nminutes passed, and Nila began to wonder where Bo had gone. Had he\nabandoned her?\nNo. She realized that the lockbox was still sitting on the floor, and\nbeside it a pair of Bo’s Privileged’s gloves.\nShe sat down next to the lockbox and flipped open the lid. Taking a\nbook in one hand, she began to leaf through it slowly. She recognized the\nduke’s penmanship on each page. There were what appeared to be diary\nentries and then, later on, columns and figures. Once in a while there would\nbe a name, underlined. None of it made any sense to her.\nShe put the book back. The next one was much the same, and again with\nthe third. Bo would have to sort these out and find what he was looking for,\nbut he seemed happy to have these. She picked up his gloves. Strange that\nhe would leave them here.\nNila listened for the sound of his footfalls in the house or on the drive.\nNothing.\nShe stared at the gloves by the light of the candle. This was one of the\npairs she’d mended. She could tell by the coffee stain next to one of the\nrunes. On an impulse, she slid the glove over her hand.\nShe’d expected a shock. Perhaps something that would hurt her. There\nwere stories about Privilegeds who warded everything they owned so that\nother people couldn’t use them. But nothing happened when she put the\nglove on. She slid the other over her left hand."

She slid the other over her left hand.\nThey were too big for her by quite a bit. Why had Bo been so eager for\nher to put them on? She didn’t remember ever having to put on gloves when\nthe Privileged dowsers had visited her orphanage when she was young.\nNila held her hand away from her face and shied away, closing her eyes.\nShe snapped her fingers.\nAgain, nothing.\n“I really thought that would work.”\nNila nearly leapt out of her skin. She tore the gloves off her hands and\nthrew them on the floor.\nBo stood in the doorway, watching her.\n“What?” Nila said, getting to her feet. “You thought what would work?”\nBo strolled into the room. How had he gotten back upstairs without\nmaking any sound? “You don’t have the glow in the Else,” Bo said, “but\npeople who haven’t before tapped their potential rarely do. I thought there\nwas something about you. Perhaps a Knack, or maybe even sorcery. I’ve\nbeen waiting almost two weeks for you to finally try on a pair of\nPrivileged’s gloves.”\nNila smoothed the front of her dress and turned up her nose. Trickery!\n“Well, I’m not a Privileged,” she said. “Get that out of your head.”\nBo crossed the room quickly. She took a half step back, and suddenly\nshe felt the sting of his palm across her cheek.\nFury rose up inside her. He had slapped her! Unprovoked. She drew\nback her fist.\n“Wait!” Bo said.\nNila wasn’t sure why she’d stopped.\n“Look.”\nNila looked at her hand, the one cocked back in a fist, ready to beat Bo\nto a pulp. It was wreathed in blue flame. She could feel the heat of the flame\non her face but not on her hand. She gave a shout and leapt back, shaking\nthe hand until the flame went out. What had happened? How had she done\nthat?\n“Sorry about the slap,” Bo said, his eyes both gleeful and wary at the\nsame time. “I needed to elicit an emotional reaction from you.”\n“You could have just kissed me,” Nila snapped.\n“Oh? I’ll keep that in mind next time.” Bo rubbed his chin. “It appears,\nyoung lady, that you are a Privileged. You can tap into the Else. What’s\nmore—and this is really interesting—you weren’t wearing gloves just\nthen.”\nCHAPTER\n37\nT\namas and Vlora slipped into Alvation under the cover of night.\nThe river was easy enough to cross—slippery and treacherous, and cold\nas Novi’s frosted toes, being runoff from the mountains—but no more than\nthigh-deep.\nAs they made their way past the mills and into the tenement district,\nTamas realized he’d never heard streets so quiet in the middle of the night.\nIf he closed his eyes, he might imagine himself out on the plateau but for\nthe infrequent step of boots on cobbles from patrolling Kez and the\noccasional bark of a dog.

He didn’t\neven hear the familiar slosh of chamber pots being emptied out of windows.\nNikslaus had the city under martial law, and from the look of the bodies\nhanging from the bell tower in the city center, he was serious about\npunishing infractions.\nTamas took note of the powder that Vlora had sensed. There did seem to\nbe quite a lot of it scattered throughout the city, and not just in munition\ncaches. They had enough to supply twenty brigades—which seemed\nstrange, because there weren’t any Deliv soldiers around and it was far\nmore than the Kez could carry.\nAs they passed through the market district, there was a sudden shout\nnearby. Tamas stopped to listen, and a moment later the crack of muskets\nfilled the air.\nTamas motioned for Vlora to follow and sprinted toward the sound. It\ncouldn’t have been more than two or three streets over. He climbed a nearby\nmarket building and headed quietly toward the edge.\nThe street below was a war zone.\nBodies littered the cobbles, no more than lumps in the darkness, lying in\npools of their own blood.\nAn experienced eye told Tamas that the Deliv had sprung a trap on a\nKez patrol. The initial volley had done its work, cutting down half the\npatrol, but the rest had taken the fight to the Deliv partisans and were\nmaking short work with their bayoneted muskets.\nTamas drew his pistols.\n“Not our fight,” Vlora whispered urgently in his ear.\nHe hesitated a few moments, and that was long enough for the Kez\npatrol to finish cleaning up the partisans. What remained of the Deliv fled\ninto the night. The patrol regrouped to tend to their dead and make prisoners\nof the wounded partisans.\nTamas descended from the rooftop and headed back down the street.\nWhen they’d gone far enough, he said, “An organized resistance. They’re\ntrying to take back the city.”\nVlora had her nose to the wind, her ear cocked. She nodded slowly as\nher eyes searched the night. Like him, she was in a powder trance, listening,\nsmelling—trying to get a bearing on the state of the city.\n“But how organized?” she asked. “We’re trying to liberate the city in\none day. Not help a small group of partisans.”\nOf course she was right. Tamas needed to keep perspective. He had a\ngoal for the night, and needed to reach it.\nThey passed out of the market district, then a small suburb of close-\npacked houses, before they reached a wealthier part of town. Along the way\nthey passed two more fights between Deliv and false Adran soldiers. The\nhouses became farther apart, most of them surrounded by gardens with high\nwalls, and the street was wide enough for six carriages. Tamas felt like he\nfinally knew where he was.\nHailona’s home was one of these manors.\nTamas heard the sudden sound of a man shouting. Another voice joined\nthe first and then a musket blast.

The racket grew louder—it was coming up\nthe street behind them. Tamas cast about for someplace to hide but saw only\nthe empty, wide street and walled yards.\n“Quick,” Tamas said. He dropped to one knee, making a hammock of\nhis fingers, and jerked his head at the wall beside them. Vlora put her foot\nin his hands, and he pushed her up and over the brick wall. She put her hand\nback down, but even when he jumped, it was well out of reach. Tamas\nlooked back down the street.\nA small group of Deliv appeared around the bend. There were eight—\nno, nine—of them. Most limped desperately as they fled from an unseen\nfoe. They wore greatcoats and wide-brimmed hats, concealing their\nfeatures. One stopped and fired a pistol around the corner of the walled yard\nthey’d just rounded. He leapt back from returning fire.\nTamas dropped to the ground, pulling his legs up and covering his face\nwith his coat and hat. The only place to hide was in plain sight. At best,\nthey’d think him a drunk or vagrant.\nHe watched beneath the brim of his hat as the Deliv worked their way\nalong the other side of the street, looking over their shoulders continuously.\nThe source of their fear revealed itself a few moments later. A man\nducked around the corner behind them, aimed his musket, and fired. He\nwore the Adran blues—but he was no Adran. He was followed by more of\nthe same. They ran across the street, taking cover behind the thick-grown\ntrees beside the street, firing haphazardly at the Deliv as they retreated.\nOne Deliv staggered and fell. He waved on the rest of them, cursing\nloudly when others stopped to help.\nTamas felt his fingers close around the hilt of his small sword. His heart\nbegan to beat harder. Could he just watch this slaughter and stand idly by?\nThe Deliv were outnumbered two to one, and most of them were\nwounded. Wherever they were retreating to, they wouldn’t make it.\nA Kez soldier dashed behind one of the decorative oaks that lined the\nstreet. He was less than a dozen feet away and hadn’t seemed to notice\nTamas’s huddled form. He stopped to reload his musket, clearing his barrel\nand priming the powder. Tamas felt his knuckles so tight on his sword they\nchafed. His trance-attuned hearing picked up Vlora’s whisper from on top\nof the wall: “Not our fight.”\nTamas’s sword entered the Kez soldier’s throat from the side, right\nbetween his esophagus and his spine. The man dropped without even a\ngurgling protest. Tamas felt his legs pump hard, the pain to his right barely\nregistering as he crossed the street in a dozen long strides.\nOne of the soldiers turned toward him. Tamas slashed his sword upward,\ncutting through the front of the man’s face, then followed through by\nplunging his sword into the ribs of the next soldier.\nThey all knew he was here now. Panicked shouting rose in the street."

Panicked shouting rose in the street.\nThe world seemed to move at a snail’s pace. Tamas sensed a spark hit\nthe powder pan of a pistol, traveling toward the barrel. In the instant before\nthe weapon fired, Tamas reached out and absorbed the energy of the blast,\nthrowing it behind the swipe of his sword as it took a man’s head clear off.\nA soldier—a woman—drew her sword, only to fall from a bullet in the\neye. Tamas’s mind barely registered Vlora’s help as he switched to the next\ntarget. A man with a captain’s silver collar dashed up the street toward\nTamas, his small sword at the ready.\nTamas threw himself forward, breaking inside the man’s guard in two\nquick strokes and disemboweling him. Tamas spun for the next Kez soldier\nand…\nNone were left. The street was clear. The only sounds were the moaning\nof the wounded and dying, and Tamas’s own panting. He felt his heart\nhammer at the inside of his chest. He cracked a powder charge and\nsprinkled it on his tongue. The hammering began to subside.\nThe Deliv were still retreating up the street. One even turned toward\nTamas, pistol raised, and fired. Tamas felt his heart skip a beat as the bullet\nricocheted off the street not far from his feet. The Deliv swore loudly\nenough to be heard across fifty paces and dropped his pistol. He grabbed\none of the other Deliv by the shoulder and pointed toward Tamas.\nThe small group came to a stop. They all stared toward Tamas as he\nstood among the Kez bodies.\nTamas looked over the group. How well could they see him in the dark?\nRegardless, he didn’t have time for this. He had a mission to finish.\nHalley’s manor was just down the street. Unfortunately, the Deliv group\nwas in between him and Hailona’s manor.\nHe looked across the street. The shadow of Vlora’s head was just visible\nat the top of the wall. He reassessed the height.\nTamas broke out in a run across the street. One of the Deliv shouted for\nhim to stop.\nHis foot hit the wall about two feet up. His boot caught just enough\nfriction to send him up, and he pushed off with all his strength. He grabbed\nthe top of the wall, felt Vlora’s hand grasp his arm, and then he pulled\nhimself up and rolled over, falling with a thump to the garden below.\nTamas rolled over onto his back, hoping he hadn’t just cracked a rib in\nhis fall. He took a deep breath. He felt some pain, but not too much.\n“You all right?” Vlora asked, crouching beside him.\n“Getting too damn old for fights like that.” He climbed to his feet and\nran his fingers along the hilt of his small sword. “But that felt good. Very\ngood. I needed a fight like that.” He paused, saw that Vlora was looking at\nhim strangely. “What?”\n“Now I know where Taniel gets it,” she said. After a few seconds, she"

After a few seconds, she\nadded, “You’re the only other one I’ve seen move as fast as him. None of\nthe other powder mages can do it. We’re all stronger and faster than regular\nmen, but you and Taniel… damn.”\nTamas’s heart hammered in his chest, too hard. He wasn’t just getting\nold. He was old.\nThey headed across the garden and crossed the wall again a hundred\nyards later. The group of Deliv was still in the street, now behind Tamas,\nand were checking the dead and finishing off the wounded Kez soldiers.\nTamas and Vlora crossed the street farther down, unnoticed.\nThey kept on down the same street and turned two corners before they\nreached Hailona’s city manor.\nIt was a grand affair with a short gravel drive, manicured lawn, and a\nbrick façade with evenly spaced windows. The roof was tall and steeply\nslanted and must have had over a dozen chimneys.\nThe windows of the manor were dark, the driveway lanterns unlit.\nTamas ran across the lawn and around the back of the house. He passed by\nthe servants’ quarters, where there would likely be someone still up, and\nfound the observatory porch.\nThe observatory had belonged to Hailona’s husband before he died\ntwenty years ago. The last time Tamas had been here it was Hailona’s study.\nHe paused at the glass door to the observatory as a thought occurred to him.\nHe didn’t even know if she still lived here.\nTamas sought to recall if Sabon had ever mentioned Hailona selling her\ncity manor. Not likely. He was usually taciturn when it came to the subject\nof his sister.\nIt was better that way.\nTamas forced the door with his shoulder, wincing when it made a loud\nnoise. He paused, listening for the sound of footsteps or of a servant\nsounding the alarm.\nNothing.\nHe stepped inside. Vlora followed after him a moment later.\nThe study was different from the last time he’d been here. No telescope.\nA different desk. Where it had been, a large globe of the world rested on a\nstand in the corner.\nTamas felt the creeping fingers of panic in his bowels. What if she\nwasn’t here? She was his only link in this city. How would he find Gavril?\n“This,” Tamas whispered, “might not be her home.”\nVlora touched his arm. “Is that her?”\nThere was a portrait above the mantel. It was a Deliv man that Tamas\ndidn’t recognize. He wore a military uniform, and his head was shaved\nbald. Behind him stood Hailona.\nTamas let out a soft sigh of relief. This was the right place after all.\n“I’ll have to go wake her up,” Tamas said. He wasn’t looking forward to\nthis part. A gross invasion, entering her bedchamber at this time of night\nwas not the best way to reignite a long-forgotten acquaintance.\nEspecially if she’d remarried.\nVlora hissed at him. She stood beside the window, her fingers on the\ncurtain."

She stood beside the window, her fingers on the\ncurtain.\nHe went to her side. There were people outside, coming straight for the\nobservatory portico. Tamas blinked. It was the same group he’d saved from\nthe Kez soldiers. Was her husband among them?\n“Hide!”\nTamas made for the closest door, sliding inside and closing it all the way\nbut for the slightest crack. He checked his surroundings. A closet, albeit a\nbig one. Vlora barely moved, electing to slide behind a thick curtain. Tamas\nswore quietly. Neither of them could extricate themselves without alerting\nthe occupants of the room.\nTamas watched the room through a crack in the door. He could hear\nhushed voices outside, but not make out what they were saying. The glass\ndoor opened and the group filed in.\nMost seemed wounded in some way. Two of them had to be carried.\nTamas could smell the gunpowder and blood—but then again, that may\nhave just been him.\n“Get us some lights,” a woman’s voice said. “Ruper, take them to the\nsitting room. Fetch towels. Get a fire going. We need hot water.”\nTamas recognized that voice. Even after fifteen years he recognized the\nvoice, and it surprised him.\nHailona.\nDoors opened and shut, feet pounded frantically into the rest of the\nmanor house. There was grunting and cursing as the wounded were carried\nto another room.\nA male voice spoke up as someone fumbled around in the dark. “They’ll\ncome for us.”\n“I know,” Hailona said. She sounded miserable.\nA lantern was lit, casting the room into light and shadow. Tamas blinked\nhis eyes to let them adjust. Through the crack in the door he could see a\nDeliv with a black braided ponytail over one shoulder. The man suddenly\nswept his arm across a desk, throwing parchments, weights, and a small\nstack of coins to the floor.\n“Someone must have sold us out!” he said. “I’ll find them, I’ll kill them\nwith my bare hands.”\n“Calm down, Demasolin,” Hailona said.\n“I will not! All is lost. They were ready for us. You saw it as well as I.\nThe bloody Adrans! Indier took a bullet through the eye the moment she\nstepped into that room! A dozen musket men, all concealed in the shadows.\nSomeone had betrayed us.”\n“They’re not bloody Adrans,” Hailona said. She sounded uncertain.\n“You heard them speak in Kez.”\n“A ruse! Two brigades in Adran blues! You think we wouldn’t have\nheard about two brigades of the Grand Army splitting off from Budwiel to\ncome up here? Our spies are better than that.”\n“And our spies in Adro?”\n“We have few spies in Adro! They’re supposed to be allies.”\n“Tamas would never—”\nDemasolin whirled on Hailona. “Don’t you defend him! That damned\nbutcher would do anything, and you know it.”\n“And Sabon?” There was steel in Hailona’s voice. “You think Sabon"

Oh, pit. She didn’t know Sabon\nwas dead. He’d sent her a message, but it must not have reached her. He\nsqueezed his eyes closed, trying to control his breathing.\n“There’s a reason your parents disowned him,” Demasolin said.\nTamas heard a loud crack. Demasolin reeled back into view, clutching\nhis cheek. Hailona stormed after him. It was the first time Tamas had gotten\na good look at her.\nShe had not aged well. Her features were wrinkled, her hair gone gray.\nThere were well-defined crow’s-feet in the corners of eyes red from unshed\ntears. Her jaw was set, her hand raised to strike again.\n“Speak ill of my brother again,” she said quietly, her voice a challenge.\nDemasolin squared his shoulders. “You dare strike a duke of the king?”\nA duke. No wonder he thought Tamas a butcher. The nobility of all the\nNine feared and hated Tamas, even his supposed allies. Just what Tamas\nneeded.\nHailona was about to speak when Demasolin held up one hand. He\nsniffed the air. His eyes suddenly darted around the room.\n“There’s someone here,” he whispered.\nTamas could see Vlora’s hiding spot from his own. The curtains shifted\nslightly. Tamas laid his hand on the hilt of his sword and took a long, quiet\nbreath. He put his other hand on the closet door, ready to push it open at any\nmoment.\nDemasolin drew his sword and began to make a long circuit of the room,\nsniffing and casting about. Tamas let himself relax and opened his third eye.\nDemasolin glowed faintly in the Else.\nHe had a Knack.\nDemasolin had just passed Vlora’s hiding spot when he suddenly\nwhirled and thrust his sword into the curtains with a shout.\nTamas choked down a startled cry.\nNothing had happened. Demasolin pulled back the curtains.\n“An open window,” Hailona said. “Really?”\n“There!” Demasolin said, gazing out into the night. “Someone flees!”\nHe dashed out the door, sword at the ready, and into the night.\nThe room was empty but for Hailona. He could see her rush to the door,\nwatching Demasolin disappear. A moment later she came back into the\nroom, her shoulders slumped, and dropped into a divan.\nTamas felt a great dread in the pit of his stomach. His heart thundered in\nhis ears, and he paused for a moment to gather his nerve. Charging into a\nbrigade of Kez was easier than this.\nHe took his hand off his sword and pushed the closet door open.\n“Hello, Halley,” he said.\nWhen Adamat arrived at the headquarters of the Noble Warriors of Labor,\nRicard wasn’t there. In fact, no one was there but the porter and the\nbartender, and the latter poured Adamat a glass of Gurlish beer from a\nchilled cask and directed him to wait in the foyer."

Through the crack, he could see Ricard striding through the foyer,\ntossing his coat angrily on the floor. The union boss’s thinning hair was\nstanding straight off his head, and his white shirt was wet with sweat. “Get\nme a drink!” he yelled. Fell trailed behind him, along with a half-dozen\nother assistants.\nNo sign of Lord Claremonte’s men. Adamat stepped out of Ricard’s\noffice, feeling a little sheepish about his suspicions.\nRicard strode past him into the office and threw himself into his desk\nchair.\n“We’re buggered, Adamat,” he said.\nInstead of asking why he’d been left waiting for three hours, Adamat\nsaid, “Why?”\n“The Brudania-Gurla Trading Company has invaded our country.”\n“What did you find out?” Adamat asked.\nThe porter brought Ricard a bottle of dark whiskey and a glass. Ricard\nthrew the glass in the fireplace, where it exploded in a tinkle of shiny\nshards, then grabbed the bottle and pulled out the stopper, downing a\nquarter of the bottle in several long swallows.\nAdamat yanked it from his fingers. “You getting shit-faced isn’t going to\nhelp anyone.”\n“You don’t understand,” Ricard said. “Claremonte’s coming, and he’s\nbringing everything he has with him.” Adamat could see in Ricard’s eyes\nthat he wasn’t just angry or flustered; he was scared. Adamat had never\nseen his old friend like this. There was real fear in his eyes.\n“Has Brudania invaded?” Adamat asked.\n“Pit if I know. Not a damn shot was fired. No one even tried to stop me\nwhen I went up to the locks to ask questions. Claremonte just bribed every\nunion member on the canal and brought his fleet over. Simple as that.\nThey’ll be here tomorrow.”\n“Tomorrow?” Adamat blanched. “How could they possibly be here that\nquickly?”\nRicard pointed out the window, though it didn’t even face the direction\nof the canal. “We built the canal to bring goods over the mountains quickly.\nIt can support the draft of Claremonte’s merchantmen, and the Ad River has\nbeen deepened the entire way down. The union has spent the last five years\nreplacing every bridge on the Ad just so that we can do exactly what\nClaremonte is doing now. Nothing can stop him.”\n“Surely there’s something.”\n“I’ve spent every minute since I returned trying to come up with an\noption. I wasted an hour talking to blacksmiths to see if we could build an\nimmense chain fast enough to stop him, but it can’t be done.”\nRicard looked like a drowning man who couldn’t quite reach the rope"

        "text": "immense chain fast enough to stop him, but it can’t be done.”\nRicard looked like a drowning man who couldn’t quite reach the rope\nbeing lowered to him. His face was flushed, and Adamat now noticed that\nhis pants were torn up one leg at the calf.\n“You’re bleeding,” Adamat said.\nRicard looked at his leg and gave a sigh. He made no motion to staunch\nthe wound.\nFell came into the room. Her hair was back, her uniform tidy. Not an\neyelash out of place.\n“He’s bleeding,” Adamat told her.\nShe knelt by Ricard’s side and exposed the wound, tying it up.\n“Anything?” Ricard asked her.\n“We’re still working on it.”\n“We have to organize a defense,” Adamat said.\nRicard hiccuped. He reached toward the whiskey bottle. “There’s no\ntime.”\n“There’s police,” Adamat said, pulling the bottle out of Ricard’s reach.\n“Some soldiers. Call on the people. You have the newspapers. Use them.”\n“A militia,” Ricard said, sitting up, his ears perking like a dog’s.\n“Yes.” Adamat felt his heart begin to race. “This city is not indefensible.\nThere’s a million people here. Use the newspapers. You remember the\ncrowd at Elections Square when Tamas put Manhouch’s head in a basket.\nThere’s the will. The manpower. People will rise up to defend their homes.”\nRicard leapt to his feet, knocking Fell back on her ass. “Fell,” he said,\nhelping her up. “Draft a letter. Inform the newspapers. I want the front page\nfirst thing in the morning. Tell them every home in Adopest is to have a\nnewspaper by sunup. I want the presses working all night! Get me the union\nbosses. I want everyone involved. We’ll do it. We’ll defend this city!”\nAdamat felt a smile spread over his face. This was the Ricard he knew.\nRicard snatched him by the hand. “Adamat, thank you. I knew you had it\nin you. Whatever I’m paying you, double it.”\n“You aren’t…” Adamat said, but Ricard was already racing out of his\noffice. Adamat stood there for a moment, dumbfounded. Ricard shouted to\nhis footmen and assistants, giving orders like a line commander. He was in\nfull swing now, and he wouldn’t stop until he’d organized a defense of the\ncity.\nThe office was suddenly quiet and cold, and Adamat looked around for a\nglass to pour himself some whiskey. Finding none, he took a sip from the\nbottle.\n“Sir,” Fell said, breaking the silence.\n“Hmm?”\nShe stood with her hands behind her back, chin up. “I never apologized,\nsir. I want to do that now.”\n“For what?” Adamat felt his anger stir. He knew for what: for almost\ngetting his wife killed. For not containing Lord Vetas like she said she\nwould.\n“Lord Vetas,” she said. “He got the best of me. I should have taken more\nmen.”\nAdamat fought down his anger, forced himself to remain calm.

He got the best of\nme far too many times.” As he said the words, he felt something shift in the\nback of his mind. He frowned.\n“Sir?” Fell asked when he’d been silent for several moments.\nHe held up a hand for quiet. He needed to think. Vetas had gotten the\nbetter of him on many occasions. All evidence said that he was a genius\nplanner with no heart for remorse and no hesitation considering lives lost.\n“Is he dead?” Adamat asked.\n“Vetas? Yes. He died two weeks ago. Bo got rid of the body.”\n“And where is Bo?”\n“He’s disappeared,” Fell said. “Ricard even offered him a job, but he\nwouldn’t take it.”\nAdamat smoothed the front of his jacket. He’d told Bo about his\nreservations over Vetas. That perhaps Vetas hadn’t told them the entire\ntruth, or even led them astray. He even…\n“Damn!” Adamat said. “Vetas. He knew everything. He got the better of\nus one last time. Not even Bo could get it out of him.”\n“How do you know?” Fell asked.\n“The pier.” Adamat shook his head. She wouldn’t know what he was\ntalking about. “I asked Vetas for a way to track down my boy, and he sent\nme to the slavers that Josep was sold to. He told me who to ask for, and the\npasswords to use. But he gave me the wrong password! The slavers\nattacked me. I barely got out with my life, and I was so intent on getting\nJosep back that it didn’t occur to me until now.”\nAdamat slumped against the wall. There was nothing he could do about\nit now. Vetas was dead. There’d be no reckoning, no confrontation. What\nlittle advantage Adamat thought they may have gained over Claremonte\nwas gone—if that wasn’t made apparent enough by Claremonte’s sailing his\nfleet over the Charwood Pile Mountains.\n“What information did you get from Vetas?” Adamat asked.\nFell frowned. “Reports. His master’s plans.”\n“What plans?”\n“Campaign plans for the ministerial election. His platform for\nreformation within the city.”\n“They’re all trash,” Adamat said.\n“But there was good information there. We found other hideouts. More\nof his men in the city.”\n“He wants us to think we have some kind of advantage. We don’t.\nEverything we learned from Vetas is suspect.”\nAdamat took his hat from the peg beside the door and gathered his cane.\nHe felt so very tired.\n“What are you doing?” Fell asked.\nTheir only hope was Ricard’s ability to rouse the city. Otherwise it\nwould be in Claremonte’s hands by tomorrow night.\n“Going home. I’m going home to my wife. I’ll see you at the north gate\nof the city tomorrow morning.”\nCHAPTER\n38\nM\nidway Keep was a historical monument, a castle of vanity built not for\ncomfort or even defense but to look imposing.

        "text": "comfort or even defense but to look imposing. Its walls were tall but easily\nscaled, the indefensible number of entrances brimming with fortifications.\nThe keep towered over the Addown River and menaced the main highway.\nTo the peasants it may have been breathtaking.\nTo anyone skilled in warfare it was a joke.\nIt had been built some three hundred years ago by a juvenile king who\nconsidered himself an architect. To Taniel, it seemed the perfect place to\nhouse a mad god.\nTaniel watched the keep from the shadow of a sprawling oak standing\nsolitary in the middle of the Kez army. He could hear the soft sounds of a\nsnoring infantryman nearby. Otherwise, the night was still.\nHe checked that last thought when he realized he could also hear Field\nMarshal Goutlit’s unsteady, terrified breaths. The Kez officer crouched\nbeside him, still smelling faintly of piss, and fidgeted with the collar of his\njacket. Taniel watched him out of the corner of his eye. A wrong move here,\na suspicious noise, and Taniel was a dead man.\nOf course, he’d be sure to take Goutlit with him.\n“Where’s the servants’ entrance?” Taniel whispered.\n“I don’t know.”\nTaniel drew his belt knife.\n“I, uh, think it’s over there. To the right.”\nTaniel pushed the knife back in its sheath. “Is it guarded?”\nGoutlit swallowed hard and eyed Taniel, as if afraid to say he didn’t\nknow.\nA light caught Taniel’s eye, just in the corner of his vision. He crouched\na little farther down and watched the keep for several moments. There. He\nsaw a light moving in a high-arched window.\nGoutlit saw it too. He scooted back, pressing himself up against the big\noak behind him. Taniel grabbed a handful of Goutlit’s jacket to keep him\nfrom moving farther.\n“Where’s Kresimir’s room?” Taniel asked.\n“There,” Goutlit’s voice came out dry and raspy. He lifted a finger.\n“That tower there, just above the light.”\nA sudden whine cut through the night. It was a low keening that rose\nsharply into a wail. A low thump accompanied it, and then a human scream\nthat grew louder and louder until Taniel was sure that a banshee was going\nto come out of the tree above them.\nJust as quickly as it began, the sound was over. Distantly, from the keep,\nhe heard a sound like crashing furniture.\n“What the pit?”\n“Kresimir,” Goutlit said, his voice barely a whisper. “Every night.”\nGoutlit turned to stare at Taniel. “Every night he’s looking for the eye\nbehind the flintlock.”\nTaniel shivered involuntarily.\n“Every morning they find bodies,” Goutlit said. “Usually just a few, but\nsometimes as many as a dozen. Prielight Guards, servants. Kresimir’s\nconcubines. Some of them are strangled while others have been burned\nthrough by sorcery.”\n“Shut up,” Taniel said. His skin was beginning to crawl. He set his\nmusket against the tree and watched while the light in the keep moved\nfarther and farther away from Kresimir’s tower."

He set his\nmusket against the tree and watched while the light in the keep moved\nfarther and farther away from Kresimir’s tower.\n“You can’t kill him,” Goutlit said.\n“What?” Taniel snapped.\n“That stuff about Kresimir’s bedsheets. Do you think I’m a fool? You’re\ngoing to try to finish the job you started on South Pike, aren’t you?”\nTaniel remained silent. There was fear in Goutlit’s voice.\nGoutlit went on, “He can’t be killed. About twenty have tried so far.\nAssassins from your own army. From the Church, and even one of Ipille’s\n—though Kresimir doesn’t know that.”\nThe Church had tried to have Kresimir killed? Even while their\nPrielights guarded him? Now, that was interesting. There must be a division\nwithin the Kresim Church.\n“No one’s gotten close enough, I’d imagine,” Taniel said.\n“Oh, they have.” Goutlit swallowed hard. “I saw one assassin with my\nown eyes. A woman. She tried to open his throat. Her knife bent on his\nskin.”\nTaniel remembered shooting at Julene once, in her cave-lion form. The\nbullet had simply skimmed off her skin like a smooth stone off of water.\nAnd now Taniel was trying to steal from the god who’d managed to nail her\nto a beam.\n“Not enough force.”\n“He was hit by a cannonball, walking the front. It shattered on him!\nKilled half a nearby gun crew and a colonel.”\nGoutlit had begun to talk louder. His voice was high-pitched, and he\nbreathed heavily. His whole body began to tremble. Taniel shook him by the\nfront of his jacket. It didn’t seem to help.\nTaniel realized he had a problem. He would need to scale the walls of\nthe keep. Easy enough by himself, but impossible for Goutlit.\nThe simplest thing would be to just kill the man. He was an enemy, after\nall. A Kez. Their field marshal.\nTaniel lay a hand on his knife. Goutlit didn’t seem to notice. A quick\nstroke, silent as can be. It wouldn’t be the first man Taniel had killed, nor\nthe last.\nThen again, this was butchery. Goutlit was his prisoner.\n“Take off your clothes,” Taniel said.\nGoutlit seemed to snap out of whatever fear had been racing through his\nmind. “I beg your pardon?”\n“Clothes. Off.”\n“I refuse.”\n“This is me saving your life,” Taniel said. “I can either tie you up, to be\nfound in the morning, or I can kill you. Tell me now, but decide quickly.”\nTaniel thought for a moment that Goutlit would cry out. Was this the\nindignity to break him? Goutlit watched Taniel in silence and then removed\nhis jacket.\n“You can keep your underclothes on,” Taniel said, “but make it quick.”\nWhen the field marshal had stripped to his underwear, Taniel motioned with\nhis knife at the tree. “Climb.”\nGoutlit’s eyes widened. “I can’t possibly…”"

Goutlit scrambled up to the lowest branch\nawkwardly. Taniel gathered Goutlit’s clothes and followed him up.\n“Keep going.”\nGoutlit was about thirty feet in the air before he clutched a thick branch\nand absolutely refused to climb farther. His eyes rolled wildly, and Taniel\ncould hear his teeth chatter.\n“I won’t go higher. Kill me now.”\n“This will do.” Taniel fastened Goutlit to the tree branch tightly, using\nGoutlit’s own belt and pants as restraints. “It’s not comfortable, but you’ll\nlive.”\nTaniel stuffed one of Goutlit’s socks into the field marshal’s mouth.\nHe ignored Goutlit’s squeals of protest and began to descend. By the\ntime he reached the ground, he couldn’t even hear the man, and once he’d\ntaken a few dozen steps, Goutlit was all but forgotten.\nTaniel timed the Prielight patrols around the base of the keep and slipped\nup to the wall after the last patrol had passed. The keep had once had a\nmoat, but that had long ago filled in, leaving only a swampy lowland and a\nfew ponds behind.\nThe walls of the keep were easily sixty feet high, and the one leading up\nto the tower that was Taniel’s target couldn’t have been less than a hundred.\nNo small climb.\nHe left the musket in some weeds and secured his pistols and dagger\nbefore beginning the climb. Immense blocks of granite, half Taniel’s height,\nwere stacked at a slight incline, each one with a lip that gave his fingers a\ncouple inches of room to hold on to. Taniel tested his grip with both hands,\nthen hauled himself up.\nHe was halfway up the wall when a Prielight patrol passed under where\nhe’d been. He hung off the wall, breathing quietly and praying they’d not\nstumble across his musket. A raised voice, even a suspicious glance\nupward, and he’d be finished. He silently cursed himself for taking the dead\nguard’s uniform. The Kez military tan stood out against the dark granite of\nthe keep like a beacon.\nThe patrol kept moving, and Taniel resumed his climb.\nHe reached the top of the wall, just under the parapets. He could hear the\nsteady tread of a patrolling guard just above him, and then another sound. It\nseemed quiet and distant at first, and then grew louder.\nTaniel pressed himself against the stone, his fingers and arms aching\nfrom the climb. What was that sound? He looked down. Far below, another\nPrielight patrol. Was someone sounding an alarm?\nHe let go of the wall with one hand and carefully dipped into his pocket,\ntaking a powder charge between his fingers. He’d make noise if he snorted\nit, so he crushed the end of the charge and sprinkled it in his mouth.\nThat infernal sound would not go away.\nHis powder trance intensified and he clung to the wall for a moment of\ndizziness.\nTaniel almost began to laugh."

It came from one of the windows below him.\nHis heart hammering in his ears, Taniel heard the guard on the parapet\ncurse softly to himself, and then the sound of running footsteps as the man\nwent to see what was wrong.\nThere was no time to waste. Taniel couldn’t be sure if the scream had\nbeen Kresimir, or one of the god’s victims, or even someone raising the\nalarm on Taniel. He pulled himself up to the parapet and peeked over. No\none.\nOn the parapet, Taniel padded quietly toward Kresimir’s tower. He could\nmake out other guards on the opposite walls of the keep, all of them looking\ndown toward the source of the scream. None of them seemed to have\nnoticed him.\nHe reached the tower and swore. No door on this level. He looked up.\nAnother fifty feet of climbing, in full view of the guards on the parapet.\nWait. A window, not fifteen feet above him.\nTaniel threw himself up the stone wall, climbing as quickly as he dared,\nand in only a few moments he was through the window.\nHe found himself in the spiral staircase of the tower. He glanced back\nthe way he’d come and had to stop to blink away a dizzy spell.\nIt was a long way to fall.\nTaniel climbed the tower stairs until the stairs ended in a thick iron-\nbound door. He paused there and wondered what kind of a ward a god\nwould put on his bedroom. He looked down and was grateful that his hands\nwere not shaking. No sound of footsteps below him. No breathing from\ninside the room. Kresimir must be out.\nTaniel pressed gently on the door. It opened with a single long creak that\nmade him cringe.\nHe paused at the sight of the room.\nTaniel had expected something like he’d seen in Kresimir’s palace on\nSouth Pike: a fine bed with expensive silk and lush carpeting and wall\nhangings, preserved against nature and time. But this… this was not the\nopulent quarters of a god.\nThe rug was nothing more than a soiled sheet. The curtains—perhaps\nonce fine—were now torn and bedraggled. There was a full body mirror,\nshattered. A four-poster bed lay slanted against one wall, two of the posts\ndestroyed.\nWas this really Kresimir’s room? It showed signs of habitation. There\nwas a table by one window, set with a meal. Taniel crossed to that and\nglanced out. He was just above the Addown. On the table was a tankard,\nhalf full of beer. A mouse, unafraid of Taniel, nibbled on the bread.\nThis had to be a mistake. Taniel had seen Kresimir’s palace. He’d seen\nKresimir’s city.

The sheets were covered in blood; spattered\nrust-colored stains.\nTaniel opened his third eye.\nHe dropped to his knees, staggered by the kaleidoscope of colors within\nthe Else. Thousands of pastels swirled and moved, as if sorcery itself was\nborn in this room. Taniel had to breathe deeply, suppressing the urge to\nvomit. The whole mountainside of South Pike hadn’t looked like this after\nmonths of Kez Privileged slinging their strongest sorcery at Shouldercrown\nFortress.\nTaniel forced his third eye to close and slowly got back to his feet. He\ndrew his dagger and staggered to the bed.\nHe grabbed the sheet and tore it off the bed. One or two long strips\nwould do it. He could wrap them around his waist, beneath his jacket, and\nbe out the window in less than a minute.\nTaniel stopped. He’d heard something. Just the wind, or…\nFootsteps on the stairs.\nHe finished his cuts and grabbed a handful of bloody linens. He made a\ndash for the window.\nThe door opened.\nA Prielight Guard stood in the door, a platter with fresh bread and\ncheese and a bottle of wine. He stopped, mouth open in surprise, at the sight\nof Taniel.\nThe silence was broken as the guard threw the platter to the floor and\ndrew his sword, running forward with a shout.\nCHAPTER\n39\nT\namas wasn’t sure which bothered him more: the look of sudden fear in\nHailona’s eyes, or what she said immediately afterward.\n“It’s true. Adro has invaded Deliv!” The words came out as a gasp.\nHailona put one hand to her mouth. “You’re here, so it must be true.” She\nrocked back in her seat, and for a moment Tamas thought she might fall.\nHe rushed to her side and tried to take her hand, but she pulled back as if\nit were a serpent.\n“Get back,” she said breathlessly.\n“It’s not true,” he said. “None of that.”\n“How can I be sure?

To\nrisk them joining the war when Kez has sacked Budwiel and threatens the\nvery heart of Adro? No, Hailona, this is a plot by the Kez to turn our nations\nagainst each other.”\nHailona visibly steeled herself. She stood, taking a deep breath and\nsquaring her shoulders.

How\ncould he convince her?\n“I have two brigades of men camped a day outside the city. We were\ntrapped in Kez after the battle of Budwiel. My men are bloodied, tired, and\nstarving. We came north for succor in Alvation. Imagine my surprise to see\nsoldiers in Adran blue holding the city.”\n“Can you prove it?”\n“Prove it? Those soldiers out there—I’d bet half of them only speak\nKez. The ones who speak Adran do it with an accent thicker than my Deliv.\nI don’t know what’s happening here any more than you do, but I have my\nsuspicions.”\n“You’ll have to do better than ‘suspicions,’ ” Hailona said. “Demasolin\nwill be back any moment. He won’t believe you.” She said the words as if\nshe didn’t believe him either.\n“Who is he?” Tamas glanced toward the door Demasolin had taken to\nchase Vlora.\n“My brother-in-law. The duke of Vindren.”\n“You remarried? I didn’t know.”\n“Ten years ago. I asked Sabon not to tell you. Where is he? Demasolin\nwill not trust him either, but a countryman is more believable than an\nAdran.”\nTamas pulled back. He felt like he’d been slapped in the face. She’d\nasked Sabon not to tell him that she’d gotten remarried? Sabon was like a\nbrother to Tamas. At one point, he’d been close to marrying Hailona and\nnow she glossed past it like it wasn’t any kind of issue.\nHe mentally checked himself. He had more important things to worry\nabout.\nHe heard steps coming down the hallway. The door opened, and an older\nDeliv gentleman in a servant’s evening jacket stood in the doorway. He\nseemed startled to find Tamas there and glanced between Hailona and\nTamas quickly. He tensed, as if ready to spring between them.\n“It’s all right, Ruper,” Hailona said. “How is everyone?”\n“Ferhulia will die before the night is over,” Ruper said. His voice had\nthe educated politeness of a butler. “Inel might make it, but we have to\nmove him. We can’t stay here. They’ll come for us.”\n“Who?” Tamas demanded. “Who is coming for you?”\n“The general in command of the…” She hesitated just a moment before\nsaying, “Adran army. His name is Saulkin. We tried to kill him tonight but it\nwas a trap. He saw me clearly when we retreated and he knows who I am.”\n“We could have barely minutes, ma’am,” Ruper said.\nThe glass door to the observatory portico opened. Demasolin strode\nthrough the door. He removed black gloves and threw them to the table,\nonly to freeze in place when he saw Tamas.\n“Who is this?” His gaze cut through Tamas, his eyes narrowed. Tamas\nwas able to see him better now.

Demasolin was in his thirties, perhaps, with\na clean-shaven face and strong jawline. He had the bearing of a duke,\nTamas decided.\n“An old… friend,” Hailona said. “Did you catch the intruder?”\nDemasolin continued to stare at Tamas. “Apparently not.” His nose\ntwitched as he sniffed. “She got away,” he said. “Leapt the garden wall like\nit was nothing. A powder mage. I’d bet my life on it.” Another sniff. “As is\nthis one.”\nIn one quick motion Demasolin discarded his pistol and a belt of powder\ncharges, throwing them away from Tamas. He drew his sword. “Powder\nmage or not, I will gut you. Remove your weapons.”\n“You think you can?” Tamas asked quietly.\nTamas was tired.

Take the\ntime to explain himself.\nBut if what Ruper said was true, more soldiers would arrive any minute.\nTamas would not disarm for one man with a sword.\nTamas laid a hand gently on the hilt of his sword.\nDemasolin darted forward.\nTamas drew his sword and set his back foot in less time than it took to\nblink. Demasolin came on quickly.\n“Stop! He’ll kill you!”\nDemasolin slowed. Tamas relaxed, suddenly wary. Was Hailona talking\nto him? She knew who he was. What he was capable of.\n“Demasolin,” Hailona said. “Please, wait. He’ll kill you.”\n“I’ve killed powder mages before,” Demasolin said between gritted\nteeth. “I’ve killed a Privileged. I am the duke of Vindren!” He said it like\nthe name would mean something to Tamas.\nIt did, finally. A tickle in the back of his memory. Vindren. A man with a\nKnack for smells. Nose like a bloodhound. Quick as a powder mage in full\ntrance.\nTamas lowered his sword.\n“You surrender?” Demasolin said.\n“No.”\nDemasolin took another step forward.\n“I feel like this is a waste of our time,” Tamas said.\n“It was you, wasn’t it?” Hailona suddenly said. “Outside in the street.\nWho killed all of those soldiers. I told you it was a powder mage,” she said\nto her brother-in-law.\n“I only saw a shadow,” Demasolin said. The tip of his sword wavered.\n“It was I,” Tamas said. “Do you want a demonstration?”\n“I don’t take well to threats, old man.”\nTamas examined Demasolin. Muscles taut, ready to lunge.

She wore her hair up,\na greatcoat over her shoulders, and Tamas could sense two pistols under the\ncoat. “Ma’am,” she said, with only one quick glance at the two men\npointing their swords at each other, “there are soldiers in the street.”\n“Put your swords up!” Hailona hissed at Tamas and Demasolin. To the\nyoung woman, she said, “How many?”\n“Eight, ma’am, but…”\n“What is it?”\n“They’re all dead, ma’am. Freshly dead.”\nHailona looked at Tamas.\nTamas shrugged. “I only killed the ones chasing you.”\nThere was a low knock on the glass door to the portico. Everyone looked\nthat way. From Tamas’s position he could see Vlora. She was carrying\nsomething large. He gestured her in.\nShe kicked the door open and swung through, tossing a body to the\nobservatory floor with a thump. “This might answer your questions,” she\nsaid.\n“One of my captains,” Tamas said by way of introduction. “Vlora, meet\nLady Hailona, former governor of Alvation.”\nVlora spared Hailona a look. “Taniel told me about her. One of your past\nlovers. She was pretty back then, wasn’t she?”\nHailona gasped. Tamas groaned. Demasolin spun toward Tamas.\n“Field Marshal Tamas,” Demasolin roared. “On guard, you dog!”\nHe leapt at Tamas with startling speed. Tamas was barely able to bring\nthe point of his sword up in time. Immediately on the retreat, he parried\ntwice and danced backward. He could feel his leg protest in sudden agony\nwhen he twisted away from a particularly savage thrust.\nTamas was suddenly falling. He landed on his ass, crashing into a potted\nplant and knocking it over. He kept his sword up in a defensive position as\nDemasolin pressed forward.\nA pistol fired, bringing Demasolin up short. Tamas stared at the tip of\nDemasolin’s sword, barely able to register how fast the man moved. It was\nlike fighting a Warden, with all their speed and none of their clumsiness.\nVlora held a smoking pistol pointed at the ceiling in one hand. In the\nother, a loaded pistol aimed at Demasolin. Plaster drifted down from the\nceiling. “Stop,” she said. “Drop the sword. I won’t miss.”\nDemasolin looked once at Vlora, then once at Tamas, lying as he was at\na disadvantage on the ground. Tamas tried not to let his pain reach his eyes.\nShow no weakness.\nDemasolin threw his sword to the floor with a snort of disgust.\nTamas heard several sets of footsteps in the hallway outside. Faces\nappeared at the door. Swords and pistols were drawn. Vlora kept her pistol\ntrained on Demasolin.\nHailona made a calming gesture with both hands. To the people at the\ndoor, she said, “Everything is fine here. Prepare to leave. We have to get out\nof the manor.”\nVlora nudged the body at her feet with one toe. It was a man in an Adran"

It was a man in an Adran\ncoat, with brown hair and a mustache. He was alive, his eyes wide, looking\nat Vlora in fear. “This one can answer some questions,” Vlora said.\nDemasolin crossed the room and grabbed the front of the man’s coat\nwith both hands, pulling him into a sitting position on the floor. The\nsoldier’s hands had been tied with his own belt.\n“Why are his boots missing?” Demasolin said.\nVlora lowered her pistol. “Less willing to run if he doesn’t have boots.”\nTamas slowly climbed to his feet while the attention was away from\nhim. He couldn’t tell which hurt more—his leg or his pride. Too old for this.\nHe tested the leg gently. It seemed to take weight. A momentary bout of\nweakness? He better not risk it.\nHe sheathed his sword and limped to the large desk in the middle of the\nroom so he’d have something to lean on. Hailona watching him. Her eyes\nheld something between suspicion and fear.\n“Who,” Demasolin demanded of the prisoner, “are you?”\nThe man’s eyes remained wide as they flitted between the unfriendly\nfaces in the room. He remained silent.\nDemasolin shook him by the front of his coat and switched from Deliv\nto Adran. “Who are you? Speak, now!”\nNothing.\nDemasolin slapped the soldier, openhanded. The soldier suddenly\nstruggled, grappling with Demasolin, trying to throw him off, only to stop\nimmediately when Vlora set the barrel of her pistol against his neck.\nVlora leaned over the soldier. In Kez, she said, “Do you understand\nme?” It was a soft tone, almost seductive, and Tamas wouldn’t have heard it\nif he wasn’t in a powder trance still.\nThe soldier nodded.\n“Do you value your life?”\nHe nodded emphatically.\n“Darling, if you want to live through the night, you’ll answer the good\nman’s questions. If not…” She gently rubbed the end of the pistol barrel\nagainst the soldier’s neck.\nAgain with the tone, almost seductive. It was a side of Vlora Tamas had\nnot seen before.\n“I… I am Galhof of Adopest. Adran soldier,” the man said in Adran. His\naccent was thick, the words broken.\n“Try again,” Vlora said in Kez. She hadn’t stopped caressing the\nsoldier’s neck with her pistol. “You’ll either have to get a better Adran\naccent or develop a sudden immunity to bullets.”\nThe soldier’s eyes almost seemed to bulge out of his head as he tried to\nlook at the pistol touching his neck without turning his head. He cleared his\nthroat. “My name is Galhof,” he said in Kez, “but… I am a Kez soldier.”\n“What are you doing in Alvation?” Demasolin asked. “What are your\norders?”\n“We’re to take the Mountainwatch above the city.”\n“Why the ruse, then? Why the Adran coats?”"

Why the Adran coats?”\n“Don’t know, sir,” Galhof said. “I’m just a soldier.”\nTamas didn’t have time for this. “Guess,” he growled.\n“So that Deliv blames Adro for the attack.”\n“But,” Hailona spoke up suddenly, “how did they expect the ruse to\nhold? There are already suspicions.” She shot a glance at Demasolin. “I’ve\nbeen saying for a week I thought you were Kez.”\nThe soldier looked around the room again as if seeking allies. He said\nnothing.\nTamas felt a sudden dread in the pit of his stomach. It grew heavier as\ncertainty within him grew. When he spoke, it came out a croak. “They plan\non putting Alvation to the torch. Oh, pit. All of it. They’re going to burn it\nall, kill every man, woman, and child. They’ll leave behind just enough\nevidence to condemn Adro. By the time anyone has stopped to think about\nit, Deliv will already be at war with Adro.”\n“Not even the Kez would stoop to that,” Demasolin said.\nTamas was certain now. “The man in command of this army is a\nmonster.”\n“Who?”\n“Duke Nikslaus. The king’s favorite Privileged. He’ll stop at nothing to\nwin this war.”\n“I know that name,” Hailona said softly.\nTamas shot her a warning glance. Now was not the time to bring up his\nhistory with Nikslaus.\nRuper suddenly appeared in the doorway again. “Ma’am,” he said, “we\nhave to go. The lookout has spotted soldiers coming down the main street.\nOver a hundred of them. We have to go now.”\n“The wounded?” Hailona asked.\n“We’ll have to carry them, or leave them for the Adrans.”\n“They’re not Adrans,” Hailona said. “They are Kez. Quickly now. Get\neveryone to the cellar. We’ll take the old passage across the street to Wyn\nManor and go to Millertown.”\nThe butler didn’t even blink at the correction. “Very good, ma’am.”\nRuper disappeared again.\nDemasolin retrieved his sword from the floor and stopped beside Tamas.\n“We’re not done, old man,” he said, sliding it into its sheath with a click.\n“They call you a savior in the Adran papers. I name you a butcher and a\ntraitor to your own crown.”\n“I’m all of them,” Tamas said with a shrug.\nDemasolin seemed taken aback by that. He strode from the room.\nTamas looked over at the Kez soldier. “He knows where we’re going,”\nhe said.\n“Right,” Vlora said. She grabbed the soldier by the back of the neck and\nforced him outside.\nHaliona put a hand to her mouth. “That man…”\nA shot rang out on the porch.\n“A soldier’s lot in life is to die for his country,” Tamas said.\n“He was our prisoner.”\n“He’s spent the last couple of weeks terrorizing your city, along with his"

Justice must fall swiftly, or it might not fall at all.”\n“Is that what you said about the Adran nobility when you sent them to\nthe guillotine?”\n“Yes.”\n“You always said you were a soldier,” Hailona said. Her voice was\naccusing. “Do you accept your own death as inevitable?”\nTamas leaned over to rub his leg. “Death is always inevitable. I gave up\non the idea I’d die surrounded by my grandchildren earlier this year.” He\ncouldn’t help but look toward the door Vlora had just left by. His thoughts\nleapt to Taniel. Was he alive? Had he come out of the coma? So far away.\nNothing Tamas could do. “One day,” he said, “I’ll die for my country. I’d\nrather it be on the battlefield than at the hands of a Kez headsman.”\n“You really believe it, don’t you?”\n“What?” Tamas asked.\n“That you are in the right.”\n“Of course.”\n“Could there have been a better way than killing all those people?”\n“Likely,” Tamas said. “But I didn’t take it.”\nTell her, something said inside of him. Tell her about Sabon’s death. It\nhas to happen sooner or later. Better she find out from him than from\nsomeone else.\n“I need your help,” Hailona said.\n“I was about to say the same thing.”\nHailona frowned. “My husband—Demasolin’s brother—was taken by\nthe Ad… the Kez. He’s being held in the city’s main prison. Tonight we\ntried to rescue him and free all the prisoners there. It was one of over twenty\nattacks all across the city we’ve been planning for over a week. We failed,\nand if our failure was any indication, so did the other attacks.”\n“The prison—are they holding all of their prisoners there?” Tamas\nasked. “They captured one of my outriders on the edge of the plateau a few\ndays ago. That’s why I came here with just Vlora. To try to rescue him.”\n“I don’t know. Demasolin has eyes all around the city. You may ask\nhim.”\nBut whether he’d answer a question from Tamas was another thing.\nTamas found Demasolin watching out the front door for any sign of the\nKez. Tamas could hear the sound of soldiers in the street, beyond the manor\nwalls. They were moving quietly, probably too low for Demasolin to hear.\nThe Deliv gave Tamas a glance filled with disdain.\nTamas ignored it.\n“Four days ago,” Tamas said, “the Kez took one of my outriders as we\ncrossed the plateau coming north. I came to the city to get him back. I\nunderstand your brother is a prisoner as well. I think we could help each\nother.”\nDemasolin didn’t so much as look toward him. “I don’t think I want\nyour help,” he said coldly.\nTamas bit back a retort, gritting his teeth. Shortsighted bastard. Typical\nnobleman."

Typical\nnobleman.\n“My son,” Tamas said quietly, “lies half-dead because he chose to save\nAdro instead of himself. He is in Adopest, and I don’t know whether he still\nlives. The man the Kez hold prisoner is my late wife’s brother. He may be\nthe last kin I have left alive.”\nTamas went on. “You think me a beast. You might be right. But the Kez\nhold your brother, and they hold mine. I think if we work together we can\nget them both back.”\nDemasolin didn’t reply. Tamas waited for a few heartbeats before\nturning away.\nNothing else he could say would sway the man.\n“Wait,” Demasolin said suddenly. “Three days ago they brought in a\nprisoner by the south gate. A giant of a man, wearing a Mountainwatch\nWatchmaster’s vest.”\n“That was him.”\n“My contacts say he’s in the same prison. I’ll help you.”\n“Thank you,” Tamas said.\n“I’ll help you, but I will not hesitate to kill you if I need to.”\nCHAPTER\n40\nT\naniel drew his knife and threw himself forward.\nHe grasped the Prielight Guard by the chest and pushed both himself and\nthe guard backward through the door. They tumbled down the stairs, a\njumble of limbs and grunts and curses. Taniel was able to arrest his own fall\nby grabbing onto the walls of the spiral staircase.\nThe Prielight went down a few more steps and landed with his back\nagainst the wall, dagger drawn. He wiped blood from the corner of his\nmouth.\n“Guards!” the Prielight yelled.\nThe Prielight sprang upward, swinging his knife. Taniel dodged one\nblow and then another. Despite being at a disadvantage in the tower stairs,\nthe Prielight was incredibly fast, forcing Taniel to dance away from quick\njabs at his feet.\nTaniel swung down for the Prielight’s head, only to have the guard move\nout of the way. The counterstrike sparked against the stone steps beside\nTaniel’s foot.\nTaniel stomped on the Prielight’s wrist to trap his hand, and leaned over,\nstabbing quickly at the neck.\nHe felt the Prielight’s fist slam into his groin. Nausea swept through him\nas he fell with his back to the stairs. His stomach felt like it had flipped. The\nPrielight Guard scrambled up the stairs and raised his knife.\nTaniel planted both feet on the Prielight’s chest and shoved.\nThe guard cried out in dismay as he tumbled back down the stairs.\nTaniel turned to run back up to the tower when something caught his\neye. There was a figure on the stairs, just down from where he and the\nPrielight were fighting. In the darkness it seemed no more than a shadow,\nand Taniel felt cold fingers creep up his spine.\nThe specter wore a mask with a single eyehole, and long white robes.\nKresimir.\nTaniel flew up the stairs, propelled by fear. He slammed the tower door\nbehind him and checked the far window. A straight drop into the Addown."

A straight drop into the Addown.\nNo telling how deep the river was there. The fall could still kill him, and\neven if he survived it, he’d be swept down the river into Budwiel.\nBut better to take his chances than face certain death at Kresimir’s\nsorcery.\nTaniel felt his pockets. The bloody sheet was gone. If he left without it,\nall this was for nothing.\nThere, in the middle of the floor. He must have dropped it when he\nattacked the Prielight. Taniel snatched up the strip of linen and stuffed it\ninto his belt.\nThe tower door opened.\nThe Prielight charged him without hesitation. Taniel grappled with the\nguard, shoving them both toward the far window.\nOver the Prielight’s shoulder he caught a glimpse of Kresimir.\n“Stop,” the god said.\nThe voice was like the toll of a bell echoing in Taniel’s head.\nThe Prielight staggered away from Taniel, clutching at his ears. Taniel\ngrabbed the Prielight by the shoulders and shoved him toward Kresimir,\nthen sprinted for the window.\nJust a few steps and he lunged, throwing himself as far from the keep\nwalls as possible. The wind whistled by his ears as he fell, his heart in his\nthroat, the dark water of the Addown rushing up to meet him.\nTaniel plunged into the inky depths, the force of the impact pushing the\nbreath from his body. His feet sank into the silt at the bottom of the river\nand he could feel himself torn by the current as his fingers desperately\ngroped for the surface. His lungs burned. His jaw ached from trying to force\nhimself to keep it closed.\nA moment later and he breached the surface, gasping for air.\nThe keep was already behind him and pulling away quickly as he was\nswept along by the river. It didn’t take long to realize that he was being\ndragged toward the banks. He felt his leg slam into a rock and then he was\nagain plunged beneath the water for a moment. He sputtered back to the\nsurface.\nPeople in the keep were shouting and pointing after him. He’d have to\nstrike for the opposite bank of the river and float it all the way down to\nBudwiel. The current was fast enough to keep him ahead of any pursuing\nPrielight Guards, and he might be able to disappear in the ruins of the city\nuntil the next night. He set his eye on the other bank.\nTaniel blinked. Something was wrong.\nThe river bank no longer slid by. The water was moving—Taniel could\nfeel the current pull at him—but he wasn’t.\nTaniel’s stomach lurched as he was suddenly viewing the bank from\nabove it. How could that be? He was still in the water.\nConfusion, then realization set in.\nHe—and a whole lake’s worth of water—had been scooped out of the\nriver by sorcery. It was as if a giant had fetched a drink with a cupped hand\nand Taniel was in that hand. His stomach lurched as he was lifted higher\nand then began moving back toward the keep."

His stomach lurched as he was lifted higher\nand then began moving back toward the keep.\nTaniel swam to the edge. There was nothing there but a long drop to the\nhard ground. He reached out probing fingers. They bumped against a wall\nof hardened air.\nA few moments later and Taniel—along with thousands of gallons of\nwater—was dropped unceremoniously in the courtyard of the keep.\nMuddy water from the Addown cascaded across the limestone cobbles.\nTaniel got to his feet, ankle-deep in water, and looked around wildly.\n“On your knees!”\nPrielight Guards poured into the courtyard, shouting in Kez. There were\ndozens, and when Taniel reached out with his senses, he was dismayed to\nfind they were carrying air rifles—no powder on any of them.\nHe reached for his knife, only to find it gone, lost in the river. One of his\npistols was missing as well, and the other one soaked through. The powder\nwould be useless. He drew it from his belt anyhow and flipped it over. On\nthe walls above, Prielight Guards aimed their air rifles.\n“Down!” The first guard to reach Taniel menaced him with a long pike.\n“On your knees, swine.”\nHe seemed surprised when Taniel darted forward, past the head of the\npike, and cracked his pistol butt across the man’s face. Taniel discarded the\npistol and plucked the pike from the Prielight’s fingers. He braced himself.\nThis, he realized, was a fight he could not win.\nAn air rifle popped, and then another. Bullets ricocheted off the\ncourtyard cobbles. Taniel sprinted toward the closest Prielight. Keep\nmoving, he told himself. Make a harder target. And get among the guards\nso that, at the very least, some might get hit by friendly fire in the confusion.\n“Stop.”\nTaniel staggered, almost dropping the pike. He suddenly felt woozy and\nout of breath. Again, the word tolled like a giant bell.\nPrielight Guards threw down their weapons and shrank to their knees,\nclutching at their ears.\nTaniel forced himself to keep going. Every step was like slogging\nthrough a bog.\n“I said stop.” Kresimir appeared at one of the courtyard doors. The water\nof the Addown he’d dumped in the courtyard seemed to shrink beneath his\nfeet and dry up, so that when he stepped it was on parched cobbles.\nTaniel kept moving. His body wanted to stop, but he knew he couldn’t.\nHe had to press on. To get away from the god.\n“Why do you not obey my orders?” Kresimir’s voice was the deepest\nbass Taniel had ever heard. It rang within his ears. The god tilted his head to\none side, as if curious. He pointed at the cobbles. “Kneel.”\n“Go to the pit,” Taniel spat. His whole body shook from the effort of\nmoving.\n“Kneel!”\nThe keep quaked. One of the Prielight Guards screamed. Taniel could\nfeel Kresimir’s confusion behind the mask."

General Ket’s provosts had hit him harder than\nthat.\n“Adran, my lord,” the guard captain said.\nKresimir took a small step back. “Who ordered you here?” He paused a\nmoment, and then, “Why does he not answer?

He was dragged up\nby the hair and hit again, then again. Amateurs these were not. Compared\nwith these, the first blow had been gentle.\n“Answer your god,” the guard captain said.\nTaniel remained silent.\n“Break his arm.”\nOne Prielight took ahold of Taniel’s wrist, bending it painfully back, and\nthen brought a knee up against his elbow as one might break a branch for\nthe fire. Taniel gritted his teeth, trying not to scream. Once. Twice. Three\ntimes.\n“Break it,” the guard captain said again.\n“I can’t. It’s like trying to break a cannon barrel.” The Prielight rubbed\nat his knee.\n“Get a hammer.”\n“Fools.” Kresimir’s voice made the Prielights cower.

He returned it to his face and\nclimbed to his feet, but did not approach Taniel again.\n“Fetch the Adran traitor,” Kresimir said. There was fear in his voice.\n“Have him identify this spy.”\nTaniel waited on his hands and knees, head sagged from exhaustion.\nKresimir had sent his men out just thirty minutes ago.\n“A traitor,” Kresimir had said.

A general’s aid, or even courier.\nPlenty of people had access to the kind of sensitive information that would\ngive the Kez the edge.\nTaniel had a feeling it wasn’t a lower-ranking officer, though. He\nsuspected a colonel, or maybe even a general.\nKresimir paced slowly in one corner of the keep courtyard. Every few\nminutes he’d turn his one good eye toward Taniel.\nTaniel stared back in defiance. He’d brought down this god. He’d put a\nbullet in Kresimir’s eye. He’d proved a god could feel pain.\nHe wouldn’t give Kresimir the satisfaction of watching him grovel.\nOf course, Taniel knew he might think otherwise after a few days of\ntorture. He had to be realistic. Ka-poel’s wards seemed to protect him from\nsorcery. Perhaps even from permanent physical damage. But he knew from\nexperience that he could still feel pain.\nFunny, that. Her protection might just be his undoing. The Kez could\ntorture him indefinitely.\nFootsteps approached from a hallway adjoining the courtyard. Taniel\nrocked back on his knees. He’d see this traitor and spit in his eye before he\ndied.\n“My lord, you summoned me?”\nTaniel’s head jerked around.\nThe traitor was an older, heavyset man. He wore the epaulets of a\ngeneral, and the left sleeve of his blue Adran uniform was pinned across the\nshoulder to make up for the missing arm.\nGeneral Hilanska.\n“Who is this assassin?” Kresimir gestured toward Taniel.\n“My lord?” Hilanska turned. His eyes grew wide at the sight of Taniel,\nand his mouth worked silently for a moment.\n“You know him?”\n“I do indeed, my lord. He is the very man you seek: the eye behind the\nflintlock.

He felt a pike blade catch his shoulder, tearing\nthrough his skin and flesh as he forced his way through the circle of\nPrielight Guards. One of the guards threw himself in front of Taniel. Barely\neven slowing down, Taniel snatched the guard by the throat and crushed his\nwindpipe.\nHilanska turned to run, but he was too slow. Taniel leapt after him,\nfingers grasping, ready to crush the traitor’s skull between his palms.\nAnd he would have, had Kresimir not stepped between them.\nThe god raised a hand, and Taniel felt that same sluggish weight fall\nupon him.\nHe tore through it, batting away Kresimir’s hand. His body didn’t feel\nlike it was his own, and he gave in to the rage flowing through him.\nTaniel expected his fists to strike steel when he touched the flesh of the\ngod. Instead, Kresimir crumpled before him, crying out. Taniel’s knuckles\ncracked hard against Kresimir’s jaw, then his face. Kresimir’s mask\nclattered to the ground, and Taniel found himself straddling the god,\npounding away.\nKresimir’s nose was a fountain of blood, and his teeth gave way to the\nbeating.\nTaniel’s fingers curled around the god’s throat when the Prielights pulled\nhim away. He flailed about with his fists, sending several of the Prielights to\nthe floor before he himself was beaten down.\n“Don’t kill him!” Kresimir shrieked, scrambling to get to his feet. His\nface was crimson, his white robes soaked with blood. “Don’t kill him,” he\nsaid again. Kresimir returned the mask to his face and backed slowly away\nfrom Taniel. “Hang him high. I want the world to see what becomes of a\nman who thought he could kill God.”\nThe Prielights dragged Taniel across the hall. He kicked and screamed,\nthrowing what punches he could. As he was pulled out of the hall, he could\nhear Kresimir speaking once again to Hilanska:"

As he was pulled out of the hall, he could\nhear Kresimir speaking once again to Hilanska:\n“Tomorrow I burn the Adran army.”\n“Are you sure, my lord? What about Adom?”\n“He will burn with the rest.”\nAdamat spent the night in the arms of his wife and rose early to make his\nway to the riverfront.\nIt was only about seven o’clock, but a thin crowd had already turned out.\nBy the blaze of the sun rising in the east over the abandoned Skyline Palace,\nAdamat could tell it would be a beautiful day. Few clouds hung above him.\nThe sky was blue and gold.\nHe found a spot where the crumbling wall of the old city overlooked the\nAd River as it came into Adopest but before it hooked around the bend and\nmet up with the Adsea. Adamat sat on the wall and dangled his feet over the\nedge, eating a meat pie he’d bought from a vendor in the street. He still felt\nburdened by the loss of Josep. Perhaps Faye was right—the other children\nneeded him now. He had to somehow protect them from this new threat.\nHe hoped that Josep would forgive him.\nNo sign of ships on the river to the north. Perhaps Ricard had oversold\nit. Surely the Trading Company merchantmen couldn’t sail all the way\ndown the Ad River so quickly?\nYet still he waited. Ricard had not given an estimate of when Lord\nClaremonte’s ships would arrive, and Adamat did not want to miss it. He\nhad no plans, no grand schemes to throw Lord Claremonte from his goals.\nAdamat could only watch. Something told him that this day would be one\nto live in his mind forever.\nBy eleven o’clock, the crowd had thickened to the point that carriages\ncould no longer navigate the streets. Noise filled the air as people shouted\namong themselves. No one really seemed to know what was going on. Their\nonly information came from the newspaper article that Ricard had run the\nnight before.\nThere was certainly excitement in the streets, and the police were out in\nfull force. More than one old veteran wore faded Adran blues and sported a\nfifty-year-old musket on his shoulder. Other men had brought their whole\nfamilies out and were picnicking on the old city wall. Pastry bakers and\nmeat pie vendors were hawking their snacks to the crowd.\nAdamat bought a newspaper from a newsie lad and perused Ricard’s\nfront-page article. It was a rousing speech that called the people out to\ndefend their city against the oppressions of foreign invasion and tyranny.\nAdamat lowered the newspaper to watch a pair of children splashing in the\nmuddy water of the Ad like it was a carnival day.\nHe flipped through the newspaper while he waited for Claremonte’s\nships. Unsubstantiated rumors out of Kez that Field Marshal Tamas was still\nalive. Fresh news from Deliv that an Adran army was besieging one of their\ncities—preposterous.\nThe slow rise of shouts throughout the throng brought Adamat’s nose\nout of his newspaper.\nShips on the horizon.\nThey began as white dots slowly creeping down the river and steadily"

They were moving at an almost\nreckless pace, especially for merchantmen navigating a freshwater river.\nThey came on at full sail with the current, the wind at their backs.\nIt was two o’clock before the ships finally reached Adopest. Adamat had\nnever sailed on an oceangoing vessel and had only been to ocean port cities\na handful of times in his life. Most of his knowledge of them came from\nbooks, but he could tell the lead vessel was a fourth-rate ship of the line,\nand he counted twenty-three gun ports on just one side. It seemed to be the\nbiggest of the ships, and it waved the green-and-white-striped flag, in the\ncenter of which was a laurel wreath, that was the emblem of the Brudania-\nGurla Trading Company.\nThe ships furled their sails and drifted downriver. Adamat could see\nsailors rushing about the deck, and Brudanian infantry staring passively\nback at the crowd awaiting them in Adopest. The gun ports were open.\nIf Claremonte was invading, his ships could destroy most of the city\nwithout even disembarking crews and soldiers.\nThere was no motion among the longboats. The infantry seemed content\nto stand on the ships and do nothing, and the sailors were…\nAdamat watched them carefully. What was going on? He cursed his\nlimited knowledge of seafaring. Crossbeams were lowered, sails unhooked\nand stowed, and very soon it dawned on Adamat that they were taking\ndown the mast.\nHe didn’t even know that ships could do that. It made sense, though.\nWhile the bridges along the northern Ad had been replaced for the passage\nof masted ships, the ones in downtown Adopest had not. If Claremonte\nwanted to get his fleet onto the Adsea, where it would be most effective,\nhe’d have to drop the masts completely, float down the river, and reinstall\nthem on the open water.\nAdamat desperately wanted to do something. This immense crowd of\npeople seemed to have no direction. Like him, they simply watched while\nthe masts were lowered. What more could they do? The ships sat at anchor\nout in the river, and they were heavily armed. It would have taken the\nAdran army to stop them.\nHe was surprised at how quickly the masts were removed, and Adamat\ngave up his seat on the edge of the wall to walk with the ships as the\nanchors were raised and they headed downriver.\nHe was even more surprised when the ships weighed anchor once more\nbetween the bridges, coming to stop just a half mile from the outlet to the\nAdsea.\nThey’d stopped, he noted, next to the towering Kresim Cathedral in the\nnew city.\nAdamat descended the old city wall and fought his way through the\nthrong to cross the bridge and head toward the Kresim Cathedral. He cast\nhis gaze toward the ships every so often, but nothing had changed. Still a\nflurry of activity on board. Still no sign of lowering the longboats or firing\nthe cannons.\nBetween the Kresim Cathedral and the Ad River was an amphitheater"

Still no sign of lowering the longboats or firing\nthe cannons.\nBetween the Kresim Cathedral and the Ad River was an amphitheater\nwhere the Diocels of the Church could address significant crowds. By the\ntime Adamat reached it, the amphitheater was overflowing with people\ntrying to get a better look at the tall ships.\nIt was a death trap. Adamat cursed everyone inside that amphitheater for\ntheir stupidity. Hundreds would die if Claremonte opened up with a single\nsalvo.\nAdamat thought he spied a familiar face nearby, and muscled his way\ntoward the river. There was Ricard, surrounded by his assistants and the\nother union bosses, Fell at his side.\n“Ricard, what the pit is going on?” Adamat demanded.\n“No idea,” Ricard said. He seemed just as confused as the rest of the\ncrowd, and regarded the ship with caution. “I’ve got my boys out in force,\narmed to the teeth with whatever they could find, but if Claremonte opens\nfire, there’s not a damn thing we can do about it. We can only stop him if he\ntries to come ashore.”\n“And who would be stupid enough to do that?” Adamat asked.\n“Look,” one of the union bosses said, “they’re lowering a longboat.”\nAdamat peered toward the ship. Sailors scurried about the deck, and\nsuddenly a longboat swung out and was lowered into the river. A rope\nladder was dropped, and men began to descend onto it.\n“Give me a looking glass,” Adamat said. Fell handed him hers.\nHe found the longboat and examined it for a few moments. There were a\nhalf-dozen Brudanian soldiers. Some rowers. A few men in top hats.\nAdamat stopped and focused on one face in particular.\n“He’s here,” Adamat said. “In the longboat.”\n“Who?”\n“Claremonte.”\n“How the pit would you know?”\n“I saw his likeness once. A small portrait at a Trading Company stock\nhouse, back before he rose to be head of the company.”\n“Let him come, the bastard,” Ricard said. “We’ll be ready for him.”\nClaremonte looked anything but worried. He laughed at something one\nof the rowers said, then clapped a soldier on the back. He was a striking\nman, with high cheekbones that contrasted with a body grown soft with age\nand wealth. His eyes were alive and happy, nothing like his late lackey,\nLord Vetas.\nThe longboat rowed away from the ship, Lord Claremonte standing in\nthe bow like a commander leading the invasion of a foreign land.\nWhich, unless Adamat was completely wrong, was what he was.\nBut where were his men? Why would he come to land practically alone,\ninto the teeth of a waiting mob who’d been told he was coming to take their\nhomes from them?\nThe longboat stopped about some distance from the shore and threw\ndown an anchor. Lord Claremonte stood up straight, facing the\namphitheater, and spread his hands.\n“Citizens of Adopest,” he began, a smile on his face, the words booming\ninhumanly across the river.\nCHAPTER\n41\nT\namas watched from the vantage of an old church tower as rain fell in"

Tamas couldn’t even see\nthe Charwood Mountains, though they rose less than a mile from his current\nposition.\nAn excellent day for his army to sneak up on the city.\nA terrible day for a battle.\nPowder would be wet, the ground muddy, and with the Kez wearing\nAdran uniforms, neither side would be able to tell friend from foe.\nThe street below was full of Kez soldiers moving supplies.\nHe watched them work with no small amount of trepidation. If he was\nright, and he feared he was, Nikslaus’s last act when he pulled out of the\ncity would be to put it to the torch, slaughtering civilians and leaving\nenough chaos behind that no one would bother to question who was behind\nthe attack.\nThe Mountainwatch above Alvation was about twenty-five miles away.\nEarly this morning, Tamas had heard the faint report of cannon fire from\nthat direction. Nikslaus had the Mountainwatch under siege.\nIt wasn’t a strong Mountainwatch. Not a bastion like South Pike; more\nof a fortified toll road. It wouldn’t hold long against two brigades of Kez\nsoldiers.\nTamas had sent Vlora back to the Seventh and Ninth hours ago.\nHe missed her now. No one to watch his back. The Deliv partisans didn’t\ntrust him, so he spent most of his time watching the Kez soldiers—watching\nfor patterns, waiting for Nikslaus to make his move. One eye always on the\nroad, on the chance Tamas would see Gavril among the prisoners being\nforced to do hard labor for the Kez.\nTamas heard a noise in the chapel beneath the tower. The large main\ndoor opened and closed again. A moment later, a set of footsteps rang on\nthe stone stairs. Tamas brushed his fingers along the grip of one pistol and\nthen took a powder charge between his fingers. He opened it carefully, only\ntaking the tiniest pinch, and sprinkled the black powder on his tongue.\nJust enough to keep him going. To fend off exhaustion and sharpen his\neyes. Not enough for him to risk going powder blind.\nHe hoped.\nHailona ascended the belfry steps and joined Tamas at the top, where he\nstood beside the enormous bronze bell. He tipped his hat to her.\n“Halley,” he said.\n“Tamas.”\nThey stood in silence for several minutes.\nTamas stole a glance at her once or twice. He’d been unfair in his first\nassessment last night. She was still a regal woman. Stately, her back\nstraight, arms held just so in a way that said she was equally comfortable in\na silk gown worth more than a soldier makes in a year and in the plain\nbrown wool that she wore now.\nIt wasn’t that she had aged poorly. She had just aged.\nThey all had, he reflected. He himself, Hailona, Gavril. She’d been the\ngovernor of Alvation for almost three decades. She’d ruled beside her first\nhusband for twenty years, then alone at the king’s bequest for another ten."

She’d ruled beside her first\nhusband for twenty years, then alone at the king’s bequest for another ten.\nThat was more than enough to age a woman beyond her years.\n“You never came back,” she said suddenly.\n“Halley…”\nShe spoke over him. “I never really expected you to. I don’t blame you.\nNot terribly, anyway. I see now what your goals were, what has driven you\nthe last fifteen years. I can’t say I agree with them, but I understand, at\nleast.”\nTamas had had dozens of lovers over the few years immediately after\nErika died.\nHe only regretted one of them.\n“You caused me a lot of pain after you left,” Hailona went on, “when I\nstill thought you might come back for me. You came and stayed for a few\nmonths, and then disappeared. But… I want you to know something. I want\nyou to know that you made me feel amazing in those few weeks. Like a\nwoman who could stand up against the world. That in my long life, only\ntwo men made me feel that way: you and my first husband.”\n“Your second husband…”\nHailona gave a choked laugh. Tamas glanced out of the corner of his eye\nto find that her face was red and she held a handkerchief to her mouth. “My\nhusband is a coward. Pit, I can’t even say his name.” She sighed, leaning\nagainst a column beside the bell. “I respect him. He’s one of the finest\nmerchants in southern Deliv, but he’s also one of the biggest cowards in\nsouthern Deliv. I do not love him.”\nTamas stared out into the pouring rain and pondered the unsaid words.\nShe didn’t love her husband—but she loved Tamas. He swallowed a lump\nin his throat.\nHe cleared his throat. “I’m sorry, Halley. For what it’s worth. I’m sorry.”\n“You’re sorry…” She laughed again. It came out a half sob.\nTamas felt his heart being torn in two. This woman beside him was a\npowerful creature. She could stand up beside Lady Winceslav among the\nbest women to seek his hand in marriage, before the world found out just\nhow bitter of an old widower he really was.\nHailona smoothed the front of her dress and visibly calmed herself. “I\nmet the general of the Kez army when they first arrived,” she said, her tone\nsuddenly businesslike.\n“They took us by surprise. Marched in, pretending to be Adrans. He\ngathered all the nobility together at the governor’s mansion that first night.\nTold us we were prisoners in the city. He had an impeccable Adran accent.\nSpoke Deliv equally well. Not a trace of Kez. I was convinced, at first.\n“Then I started thinking. I knew you. From Sabon’s letters I guessed he\nhad great influence in your decision making. Neither of you would ever\nattack Deliv. Then I thought maybe one of your generals had gone mad.\nGone rogue. This general—he seems a madman. Dangerous and deadly.”\n“Did you see his hands?” Tamas interrupted softly.\nHailona frowned. “No. He kept them tucked away beneath his coat. I"

I\nthought it strange, now that you mention it, but didn’t give it a second\nglance.”\n“He doesn’t have any,” Tamas said.\n“No hands?” Hailona seemed taken aback. “I feel like I would have\nheard of a Kez general with no hands.”\n“It was a… recent development,” Tamas said. “And he’s not a general.\nHe’s a Privileged.”\n“How could a Privileged have no… oh.” She stared at him in silence for\nseveral moments. “You took them, didn’t you?” Another long pause. “You\nhate Privileged so much?”\n“I hate him so much.” Tamas tried to keep the emotion out of his voice.\nHe wasn’t successful. “Duke Nikslaus was the one who arrested and\nbeheaded Erika, and then brought me her… her…”\nHe felt her hand touch his shoulder gently. He squeezed his eyes shut.\nFelt the tears swelling within them. He would never forgive himself for\nfailing Erika.\n“Tamas,” Hailona said.\nHe cleared his throat. “Was Sabon really disowned?”\nShe removed her hand from his shoulder and returned to lean against the\ncolumn. “Being a powder mage was never illegal here in Deliv. Nor was it\never state-sponsored, like in Adro. Our parents thought he should have\njoined the Deliv army. But if he had, they would ignore his gifts. As if he\nwasn’t a powder mage at all. When you came along and asked him to join\nyou and be in the first powder cabal in the world, he was ecstatic. I’ve never\nseen him so happy. My parents didn’t understand.”\n“He never told me,” Tamas said.\n“He wouldn’t,” Hailona said. She smiled at Tamas, and he remembered\nhow beautiful she had been all those years ago. “You’re his best friend.”\n“And he was mine.”\nThe smile disappeared. “Was?”\n“He’s dead, Halley.”\nShe took a quick step back, then another. “What? No. Not Sabon.”\n“Shot. By a Kez Warden. One of Duke Nikslaus’s men.”\n“You… you let him die?”\n“I didn’t. It was an ambush, I…”\nThe softness in her eyes a moment ago was gone. Any love, any feeling,\nalso gone. She breathed heavily, clutching at her dress, her eyes filled with\nhorror. She turned and fled down the belfry stairs.\n“Halley!”\nTamas heard the door to the chapel slam below. He fell back against the\nbell, felt it rock slightly from his weight without making a sound. He shook\nhis head and stared out into the rain sightlessly.\nWas all he left behind misery and death? Sorrow, widows, and grieving\nfamilies? He made his hands into fists. How dare she blame him? Sabon\nwas his best friend. His closest confidant for the last fifteen years.\nNo, she was right to blame him. He was a harbinger of death, it seemed.\nNot to be trusted with the lives of anyone dear."

Tamas frowned, wondering who it\nwas for only a moment before the mint-tinged smell of cigarette smoke\nwafted up the stairwell.\n“Sir,” Olem said as he joined Tamas. He wore a greatcoat and forage cap\npulled down over his eyes, soaked from the rain. Beneath the coat, his\nAdran blues. He wore the colonel’s pins Tamas had given him last night.\nThat seemed like an eternity ago.\n“I thought you ran out of those.” Tamas looked at the cigarette between\nOlem’s lips.\nOlem drew it from his mouth, turned it sideways as if it were a peculiar\nthing, and blew smoke out his nose slowly before returning the cigarette to\nits place. “Stopped at a tobacconist on the way through town.”\n“I see you have your priorities straight.”\n“Of course. You don’t look so well, sir.”\nTamas looked back out across the city. “Sometimes I feel like a\npestilence.”\n“That argument,” Olem said after a moment’s consideration, “could be\nmade.”\n“You make me feel so much better.”\n“I try, sir.”\n“What are you doing here? I told Vlora to give the signal, not order you\nhere. And how the bloody pit did you get past the river in broad daylight?”\n“I pretended I was a Kez colonel pretending to be an Adran colonel,”\nOlem said. “It was disturbingly easy.”\n“They didn’t ask for papers or proof?”\n“In this rain?” Olem gestured at the downpour. “You don’t understand an\nenlisted man, sir. Nobody asks for bloody papers in this kind of weather.”\n“Sloppy.”\n“I call it lucky. I also have news.”\nTamas straightened up. “What kind of news?”\n“A Deliv army is about a day and a half outside the city. Coming from\nthe west. Our outriders spotted them just a few hours ago.”\n“How big?”\n“Several brigades, at least.”\n“Pit.”\n“That’s not a good thing, sir?”\n“Maybe. We need to launch an attack soon.”\n“We won’t be ready, sir.”\n“We have to. Something to tell the Deliv that there is more going on here\nthan meets the eye. Otherwise their brigades will fall on us, thinking we are\nthe ones holding the city.\n“Come with me,” he said, heading for the belfry stairs. “And keep a\nhand on your pistol. I might be starting a fight I can’t win.”\nVlora was waiting at the bottom of the stairs.\n“My powder mages?” he asked.\n“Waiting in an abandoned factory a quarter mile from here.”\nTamas gestured for her to join him. He checked the street outside the\nchapel before crossing over to Millertown. The ground was muddy from the\nrain, a frothy slurry of refuse and garbage. They cut through several\nalleyways to avoid Kez patrols and then entered one of the larger mills."

They let Tamas pass through,\neyeing Vlora and Olem suspiciously. Tamas climbed the stairs to the second\nfloor.\nDemasolin was examining a report while a few of his captains and spies\nlooked on. He glanced up when Tamas entered, but did not greet him.\nTamas counted the men in the room. Six of them, if it came to a fight.\nTamas removed his gloves and threw them on the table for emphasis.\n“Why didn’t you tell me about the army?” he demanded.\nDemasolin glanced up again. “What army?”\n“Don’t be bloody coy with me. You’ve got the entire city running with\nyour spies. I know you can get people in and out. There’s a Deliv army just\nover a day’s march from here.”\n“You didn’t need to know.” Demasolin returned to reading his report.\nTamas planted both hands on the table in front of Demasolin and leaned\nover it until his face was only a few inches from Demasolin’s. “You want to\ngo another round? You willing to bet my leg will go again? Because you’re\nputting my whole army in danger.”\nHe heard the creak of movement behind him as Demasolin’s underlings\nshifted uncomfortably. Tamas would leave them to Olem and Vlora if it\ncame to blows.\nDemasolin set the report facedown on the table. He leaned back in his\nchair, and his fingers crept slowly toward the sword at his hip.\n“If the Kez know,” Tamas said, “which they undoubtedly do, they’ll\ntorch the city tonight and be gone by morning.”\n“They won’t torch anything in this weather.”\n“Nikslaus will find a way. That leaves you all dead, and my army sitting\nthere looking guilty while whoever survives the Kez slaughter will say\nAdro did it. No one wins if your king attacks my army. Would you risk the\nlives of everyone in this city, and the lives of Deliv soldiers, because you\nthink I’m a butcher?”\nDemasolin’s fingers stopped their movement toward his sword. “We’ll\nhave to act tonight. Just after dark.”\n“Have you found where they moved the prisoners?”\n“We have.”\nTamas bit his tongue. How long had Demasolin been sitting on that\ninformation, too?\n“Can you provide a distraction?” Tamas asked.\n“No,” Demasolin said. “You have one man in there,” he said. “I have\ndozens. Including my brother. I’ll be going after them, and it’ll be you who\nprovides a distraction.”\n“Where are they being held?”\n“I don’t think you need to know that.”\nTamas wanted to reach across the table and strangle Demasolin. Even\nso, he wasn’t sure if that was a fight he wanted to start, and he wasn’t keen\non risking his leg going out again.

He ran his\neyes around the marks, then spaced his fingers and did some math.\n“No,” Tamas said. “You’ve tried this already. Your failed attack last\nnight. Someone is feeding the Kez information. They’ll be ready for your\nattack on the prison and for mine on the barracks.”\n“What else can we do?” Demasolin said. “I don’t know who the damned\ntraitor is.”\n“You want a distraction? I’ll give you a distraction. This General\nSaulkin. He’s staying at the governor’s manor, correct?”\nDemasolin answered hesitantly. “Yes.”\n“Is he still there?”\n“As of an hour ago, yes.”\n“Tell your spies that Field Marshal Tamas is going to kill Saulkin.”\n“And how will that help?”\n“Because Saulkin is Duke Nikslaus, and I cut his bloody hands off. If he\nknows I’m in the city, he’ll forget about everything else.”\n“Then you’ll walk into a trap.” Demasolin held up one hand. “Don’t get\nme wrong.

He faded in and out of\nconsciousness but was, mercifully, out for most of it. He could feel the cold\nair on his skin when they finally took him outside. Through bloody eyes he\ncould tell that the sun barely touched the tips of the eastern mountains.\nDawn was here.\nKa-poel might already be dead.\nTaniel’s feet dragged behind him as the Prielight Guards carried him\nthrough the Kez camp. A thousand voices reached his ears along with the\nsounds of an army preparing breakfast. Taniel wondered if any of them\nknew—or cared—who he was.\nHe was dropped unceremoniously on the ground. Taniel lay facedown,\ngroaning into the dirt. His whole body felt numb and destroyed, smashed to\na pulp by Prielight Guards. His body would be one giant bruise in a day or\ntwo. If he lived that long.\nHe felt along the inside of his mouth and wondered at the resiliency of\nhis teeth. Was that Ka-poel’s sorcery at work? Keeping him from breaking\nbones? His ribs felt broken, though Taniel didn’t think he had the strength in\nhim to check."

His ribs felt broken, though Taniel didn’t think he had the strength in\nhim to check.\nDid he?\nTaniel opened his eyes. Men moved and worked all around him. A sea\nof legs and feet.\n“One, two, pull! One, two, pull!”\nThe mantra was repeated again and again. What could they be doing?\nHe dragged his hand along through the dirt until he could see it. Moved\na finger, then another. They were all still working. That was something,\nwasn’t it? Those cuts on his knuckles. Where had they come from?\nOh. Right.\nThose were from Kresimir’s teeth.\nStrong hands lifted Taniel to his feet. He swayed back, nearly falling.\nHis arms were lifted, wrists bound together by strong cord.\n“Make it tight,” someone said. “He’ll be up there a while.”\nUp where?\nTaniel’s arms were lifted above his head. He felt the rope between his\nwrists snag on something and the guards stepped away. Taniel’s legs gave\nout beneath him, but he didn’t fall.\n“One, two, pull!”\nTaniel’s whole body jerked as he was lifted from the ground by his\nwrists.\n“One, two, pull!”\nPanic caused Taniel to flail about with his legs, but there was nothing\nbeneath him but air. He looked up.\nHe hung from a hook fastened to an immense beam being lifted\nperpendicular to the ground. Teams of men pulled on ropes to raise the\nbeam until it pointed at the sky.\nThe vision of Julene, nailed to a beam in the middle of the Kez camp,\nher hands gone at the wrists, haunted his memory.\nHe vomited down the front of himself.\n“One, two, pull!”\nIt took the workers some time to get the beam in place. Taniel’s back\nfinally hit the wood and his feet scrambled for purchase on the beam. There\nwas none to be had.\nHe was facing the Adran camp. In the early dawn light he could see\nsoldiers gathering on the front lines, pointing and talking. A few officers\nwere examining him through looking glasses. He closed his eyes, unable to\nbear looking back. Those men he’d thought to lead to victory would see him\nhere now.\nHe had to warn them. What had Kresimir said last night? He planned to\nburn the army, and Mihali with it.\nA rasping noise reached him. It was guttural and base, but it had a\npattern to it. Slowly, Taniel realized someone was laughing.\n“Two-Shot,” the voice said.\nTaniel craned his neck.\nThere, not much farther than spitting distance to his left, was another\nimmense beam. They must have moved it up closer to the lines during the\nnight. And still hanging there, the seared stumps of her wrists crossed in\nsome kind of sick entreaty, was Julene.\n“Didn’t think I’d see you here, Two-Shot,” she said.\nTaniel looked away from the Predeii.\n“Sorry, is it my voice? They haven’t given me water in two months.”\nShe stopped and cleared her throat. Another long, raspy laugh. “The"

Another long, raspy laugh. “The\nproblem with not being able to die is just that.” A cough, and then another\nlaugh.\nTaniel closed his eyes, hoping she would stop talking.\n“You look good, Two-Shot,” Julene said. “I mean it. Look at me.\nKresimir tortured me for weeks before he hung me up here. I’m curious\nwhy he didn’t do the same to you. Don’t worry. A couple of weeks and\nyou’ll be good as new. Me, though. I’ll never heal. Kresimir made sure of\nthat. I haven’t seen a mirror lately, but tell me, can you still see that\ncharming scar on my face?”\nHad she gone mad from hanging from the beam for so long, unable to\ndie? Taniel’s arms were beginning to ache from the strain of holding his\nweight. They could only get worse as long as he was up here. He finally\nturned to look at Julene.\nShe was hideous. Most of her hair was gone. Her skin, which once\nlooked young and supple, was now cracked like old leather. Her face had\nbeen particularly savaged—the tip of her nose cut off, most of her teeth\ngone. She grinned at Taniel, as if she knew what must be going through his\nmind.\nThere was madness in her eyes.\n“Charming as always,” he said. He looked up at his hands, tied about the\nwrist. They were starting to hurt more now. He tried lifting his legs but gave\nup after several moments with a groan—half pain, half anger.\n“The pain doesn’t go away,” Julene said. “Even after months. Even after\nyour arms are numb it will still throb deep down in your shoulders. I\nfind”—she moved her head slowly to one side, a look of agony moving\nacross her face—“that switching the arm that holds all the weight gives you\nsome relief.”\nTaniel closed his eyes. Would he last that long? Would he still be alive in\nmonths, watching his country burn, unable to do a thing?\nFrom the Adran army he saw a rider heading toward the Kez lines with a\nwhite flag billowing above him.\nA call for truce? Or had that traitor Hilanska finally convinced the\nGeneral Staff to surrender?\nTaniel began to struggle harder. He had to get off this rope.\nTamas found Hailona in the mill’s basement, an old granary. It was the only\nprivate room in the place. It smelled of dry old wheat, the scent dusty in\nTamas’s nostrils.\nHailona looked up when he knocked on the door frame of the open door.\nRuper, the butler, was just inside. He stood when he saw Tamas.\n“You killed my little brother,” Hailona said.\nTamas knew that wasn’t fair. Knew he wasn’t in the wrong. Sabon had\nknown the risks of being one of Tamas’s soldiers. But Tamas also knew that\nconvincing Hailona of that would be next to impossible.\n“I need your help.”\n“Go to the pit. Get out of my sight.”\n“Hailona…” Tamas took a step forward."

Get out of my sight.”\n“Hailona…” Tamas took a step forward.\nRuper got between them, blocking the path to his mistress with his body.\nTamas narrowed his eyes at the butler. “Hailona, I need a way into the\ngovernor’s mansion. I’m going to kill the man who killed my wife and your\nbrother.”\nRuper moved forward until his chest touched Tamas’s. “My lady has\nsaid for you to leave, sir.”\nHailona held up a hand. “Ruper, it’s all right.” She dried her eyes with a\nhandkerchief. Her hand remained up, as if asking for time to think. After a\nfew moments, she let it drop. “Ruper, I want you to show Tamas the secret\npassage into the mansion.”\n“Are you sure, ma’am?”\n“Yes.”\nTamas stepped back from the butler. “Thank you, Halley.”\n“Kill the bastard, Tamas,” Hailona said. “Make him suffer.” She took a\nshaky breath. “Then I don’t ever want to see you again.”\n“I understand.”\nTamas left the mill. Vlora was waiting for him out in the rain. She wore\na tricorn hat and a greatcoat. She tipped the hat toward Tamas, water\npouring off the front. She leaned against a rifle, and he could see her blue\nuniform beneath the greatcoat and a pistol at her hip.\n“Did Olem head back to the army?”\nShe nodded.\n“Where are the others?”\n“Waiting.”\nTamas nodded. A few minutes later Ruper joined them in the street and\nthey made their way out of Millertown. At the edge of the mill district,\nlounging around the outdoor seating of an otherwise abandoned streetside\ncafé, was Tamas’s powder cabal.\nHe’d only brought the best. The ones that Sabon had been training\nduring the summer in Adopest were still in the city. They didn’t have the\nexperience or training for a mission like this.\nHis powder cabal was outfitted much the same as Vlora, in greatcoats\nand tricorn hats. Every one of them had as much weaponry and powder at\nthey could carry, from pistols to swords and daggers. Tamas felt a smile\ntouch his lips. Eight men and women, every one of them a talented powder\nmage. As good as an army, as far as he was concerned. Tamas checked the\nstreets quickly for any sign of Kez patrols, then turned to his mages.\n“We’re going to provide a distraction so that the Deliv can rescue the\npolitical prisoners being held by the Kez,” Tamas said. “Gavril is among\nthose prisoners. I’d like to be there to get our man out, but we have a more\nimportant task.\n“Ours is to cut the head off this Kez abomination of an occupying army.\nWe’re going straight for the throat. You all know my history with Duke\nNikslaus, so you all know that I choose to do this with some… relish.”\nThere was a low chuckle among the powder mages.\n“But as I said, we’re to provide a distraction.

Perhaps several\ndozen. The odds, despite our skills and talents, will be very heavily against\nus. This mission smacks of revenge for me. I won’t ask you to throw your\nlives away for my vengeance.”\nOne of his mages, a girl not much older than Vlora by the name of\nLeone, spoke up. “You expect to die here, sir?”\n“I never expect to die in battle. An expectation like that has a habit of\ncoming true. However… there are times, more than others, when the\nchances I’ll lose are much greater.”\n“That’s a fancy way of saying he expects to die,” Vlora said.\nTamas shot her a look.\n“Sir.” Andriya raised his hand.\n“Yes?”\n“I signed on to kill Kez. I’ve got fifty-seven notches on my rifle from\nthe last two months. I wanted a hundred by the end of the campaign. Will\nthere be forty-seven Kez there?”\n“I’d expect.”\n“Very good, sir. I’m coming.”\n“The rest of us are, too,” Vlora said quietly.\n“Thank you.”\n“Not doing it for you, sir,” Andriya said. “Doing it to kill Kez.”\n“I appreciate it all the same. Ruper. If you please?”\nThey followed the butler through the streets, dodging Kez patrols as they\nwent. Tamas watched the patrols from the shadows. There was an urgency\nin their step, and an extra vigilance. Tamas recognized the look. He’d seen\nit before in the eyes of comrades in Gurla, patrolling an unfriendly city on\nthe last day before a withdrawal with the expectation—and fear—that\nanything could happen.\nThe governor’s mansion was back in the same wealthy part of town as\nHailona’s manor. Their small group dashed from walled garden to walled\ngarden until they reached a small wooded park well off the main street.\nRuper led them into the woods to a groundskeeper’s shack.\nIt was a small building, barely large enough for all of them standing.\nRuper moved a table, then pulled up an old rug and tossed it aside to reveal\na trapdoor. He lit a lantern, and they descended into a cellar.\nThe cellar was rough-cut, descending past topsoil and into the clay earth.\nFrom a quick glance, it could have been any root cellar, about four feet\nwide and a dozen long, with a small room at the far end. When they reached\nthe room and turned the corner, a sharply angled tunnel led off into the\ndarkness.\nTamas counted nearly four hundred paces, sloshing through mud, trying\nto keep his greatcoat from scraping the damp sides of the tunnel, before\nthey ascended a set of stone steps and came out in a somewhat more\nspacious basement. It was a stone room, with a dust-covered wardrobe in\none corner, a double bed, and an empty musket rack. At the opposite side of\nthe room a spiral staircase led upward.\n“This room and passage,” Ruper said, his first words since joining them,\n“were made as an escape route long ago, when unrest was common in this"

It comes out from behind a false bookshelf into the\nmain office of the governor. I’ll return to my mistress now.”\nTamas caught Ruper by the shoulder before he could go back down into\nthe passage. “Tell Halley that… tell her I’m truly sorry I never came back.”\nRuper pulled himself from Tamas’s grip and headed down into the\npassage with the only lantern, leaving Tamas and his mages in darkness.\nTamas took a small touch of powder to his tongue, letting him see ever\nso slightly in the utter blackness. He headed up the staircase slowly, as\nquietly as he could. It creaked beneath him as the wrought iron ground\ntogether beneath his weight.\nAt the top of the staircase there was light. It came in through a pair of\nholes just a couple inches too short for Tamas to look through comfortably.\nHe set his face against the wall, gazing through the looking-holes.\nHe could see very little. A double door on the opposite side of the room.\nA candelabra. The top of a sofa. He opened his third eye.\nThere were blots of color in the Else. Just bright enough to be Wardens,\nbut too far away from him to be inside the governor’s office. No sign of a\nPrivileged.\nTamas pushed gently on the door.\nIt rolled forward silently, then slid to the side with nothing more than a\ntouch of a finger. Tamas stepped out into the governor’s office. It was a\nlarge room, with dozens of gilded candelabras, shelves full of books, two\nmagnificent fireplaces, and a grand window that looked out over the\ncourtyard in front of the manor.\nThe room was empty.\nTamas let out a sigh of relief and called softly for his Marked to come\nup. They filed into the room, tracking mud on the pristine red carpets. He\ndirected them with hand signals to cover the doors and windows.\nThey checked the adjoining rooms and the hallway immediately outside.\nVlora joined him by the bay window a few minutes later. “No one in\nthese office suites, sir,” she said. “A couple of Wardens downstairs by the\nfront door. Andriya says he can hear soldiers talking in the servants’\nquarters on the first floor.”\n“Good work.”\n“What now?”\n“We wait.”\n“Are you sure Nikslaus will come back here, sir?”\n“I have a good guess.”\nAndriya returned to the room at that moment. “Sir, luggage in the master\nbedroom.”\nTamas checked his pocket watch. It was just after six o’clock. “Timing\nwill be everything.”\nTamas watched out the bay window. There were a dozen or so soldiers\nin the yard. They stood at attention, facing the gate, muskets on their\nshoulders. Tamas spotted a Warden in one corner of the yard, barely visible\nfrom his vantage point.\nHe checked his watch every few minutes. Would Nikslaus come back\nhere? Had the news already reached him that Tamas was coming for him?"

Had the news already reached him that Tamas was coming for him?\nMaybe he’d read Nikslaus wrong. Maybe Nikslaus would rather flee than\nattempt to catch Tamas.\nTamas brought his attention back to the courtyard outside as several\nhorsemen came through the front gate. They were followed closely by a\ncarriage decked out with lace curtains and fine gilding. It pulled around the\nturnabout and came to a stop. Tamas was so close he could have tossed a\nrock through the window and hit the top of the carriage.\nThe door opened and a Deliv woman stepped out. She looked about\nsixteen. She wore a fine gown that displayed her ample bosom. Tamas felt a\nwave of disappointment as she got her feet on the gravel drive and looked\naround regally.\nNot Nikslaus.\nTamas stepped away from the window.\n“Sir!” Vlora motioned him back over. Someone else was getting out of\nthe carriage. It seemed a struggle for him, leaning his forearms against the\ndoor frame. It was a man. He wore white Privileged’s gloves. A Warden\nappeared from the mansion, grasping one of the arms and helping the man\ndown. His face was partially concealed by a tricorne hat.\nTamas prayed the Privileged would turn his head just a little bit so\nTamas could get a look at his identity.\nThe Privileged stopped to talk to one of the soldiers. The voices were\ntoo low for Tamas to make out. The soldier gave the Privileged a brisk nod,\nthen turned to the others. “We leave in two hours!” he said loudly. “Anyone\nwho’s not ready to move out by dark will be shot.”\nTamas’s gaze was still locked on the Privileged in the tricorne. It had to\nbe Nikslaus! But Tamas still couldn’t see his face. Whoever he was, he\nchatted amiably with the young lady beside him.\nThey had just mounted the steps to the mansion when a messenger came\ngalloping hard into the courtyard and came to a stop in a spray of gravel.\nThe messenger leapt from his horse and ran to the Privileged.\nTamas felt his heart begin to beat faster.\nThe messenger saluted and breathlessly gave his report. The Privileged\npushed him away with an elbow and spun toward the mansion.\nTamas heard the doors below burst open. The Privileged’s voice echoed\nthrough the building.\n“Get everyone!” he screamed. “All my Wardens, to me! I want five\nhundred soldiers here in twenty minutes. Give the order! We leave within\nthe hour!”\n“But, sir,” Tamas heard someone say, “the city!”\n“I don’t give a pit about the city. Deliv can enter the war with Adro for\nall I care. He’s here, you fool! He’s here!”\n“Nikslaus,” Tamas whispered.\nTamas watched as messengers scrambled out the front mansion drive,\ngoing out to give Nikslaus’s orders.\n“Well, Demasolin,” Tamas muttered, “you have your distraction.”\nUrgent steps sounded on the staircase in the foyer accompanied by\nNikslaus’s frantic orders.\nTamas looked down to find one hand already on the grip of a pistol, the"

His fingers itched.\n“He’s coming,” Andriya hissed from his station by the door.\n“Do we wait for him here?” Vlora said.\nTamas blinked and saw the bodies of Deliv politicians hanging from the\nsteeple of the Alvation cathedral. He saw Sabon’s dead eyes gazing up at\nhim from Charlemund’s gravel drive, and the countless soldiers Tamas had\nlost trying to catch Nikslaus.\nHe saw Erika’s head floating before him. Her face, frozen in horror,\nblond hair caked with blood, skin severed neatly at the neck. He saw\nNikslaus’s grin as he presented Tamas with the head of his dead wife.\nTamas poured an entire powder charge into his mouth. His body felt like\nit was on fire as energy coursed through him. Vlora must have seen\nsomething on his face.\n“Pit,” Vlora swore. “Andriya, get out of the way.”\nTamas burst through the double doors of the office, drawing his pistol in\none hand.\n“Nikslaus!” he bellowed.\nCHAPTER\n43\nC\nitizens of Adopest,” Lord Claremonte’s voice boomed.\nThe shock of the amplified sound made Adamat’s knees grow weak.\n“Pit,” he hissed, “he has Privileged with him!” It was the only way he could\nbe heard above the roar of the crowd like this.\n“My friends,” Lord Claremonte continued, “my brothers and sisters. My\ncountrymen! I bring you greetings from the farthest corners of the world. I\nhave come today to meet you, my fellow Adrans, and to lower myself\nhumbly before you on gracious knee to offer myself as candidate for the\npost of First Minister of our fair country.” At this, Claremonte lowered\nhimself down on one knee and bowed his head. A moment passed and he\nrose back up, spreading his arms as if to embrace every man, woman, and\nchild on the riverbank.\n“This is a great nation! We have so much. We have the unions, the army,\nthe Wings of Adom, the banks, and the Mountainwatch. We have industry\nunparalleled in the modern world. We have the mightiest heroes that any\ncountry could hope for in the likes of Taniel Two-Shot and the late Field\nMarshal Tamas.”\nLord Claremonte sighed and bowed his head, as if overcome with\nemotion. “Field Marshal Tamas died for you, my friends. He died for me.\nFor all of us to be free of the Kez tyranny. He had such incredible vision\nand stride, and I will not let it die with him!”\nThe crowd was utterly silent now. Adamat heard someone drop a coin,\nand he cursed himself for waiting with bated breath for Claremonte’s next\nwords.\n“For what this country needs now is hope. And for that, I have brought\nwith me nine thousand of Brudania’s finest soldiers to throw in with the\nAdran army and push back the Kez aggressors.” He threw his hand back\ntoward the line of Trading Company ships waiting in the river. “I have"

I have brought food, and money. I\nbring treasures from the four corners of the world, all of which will be put\ntoward the war effort against the Kez.”\n“I do this freely. I ask no thanks, nor hold back any of my wealth on\nreservation. I only ask that you consider me a worthy candidate for the\ncoming election.”\nAdamat noticed that other longboats were being lowered now. These\nones were filled with Brudanian soldiers, and they were free once they hit\nthe water and began rowing toward the riverbank. Claremonte’s own\nlongboat had drawn anchor and was slowly drifting closer to the\namphitheater.\n“My countrymen,” Claremonte continued in the silence that followed,\n“this country needs change. This is a forward-thinking nation! A place of\nintellectual and industrial prowess. In my ministerial duties, I will continue\nto support that change and push us forward into the coming century. We\nwill forget the old ways. The superstitions. The foolishness.\n“Gods—what have they done for you?” He shook his head. “Nothing.\nThese rumors you’ve heard about Kresimir and Adom returning? They are\ntrue! But know this; we will not tolerate them. They have no place in this\nworld of ours, and I mean to show them that.\n“We may be mortal, but we are fierce and we are proud, and even the\ngods will tremble at this mighty nation of Adro.\n“It starts today, my friends. Our new world.”\nThe final word seemed barely a whisper, but Adamat felt his heart\nhammering in his chest. Something was happening. What was Claremonte\nabout to do? What could he possibly be…? Adamat brought the looking\nglass in his hands, hitherto forgotten, back to his eye and focused on\nClaremonte.\nClaremonte turned to a woman at his shoulder. The woman raised her\nhands to reveal white gloves covered in crimson runes—a Privileged.\nAdamat read the inaudible words on Claremonte’s lips: “Bring it down.”\nSorcery cut through the clear sky, eliciting a gasp of terror from the\nassembled crowds. White lightning, like knives flashing, cut through the air\nabove the amphitheater and smashed into the Kresim Cathedral. Dust\nbillowed in great clouds above the immense building as invisible blades\nsliced clean through the stone façade.\nAn invisible fist smashed into the dome of the cathedral, and all at once\nthe building collapsed in on itself. People ran from the falling stonework,\nscreaming in terror, but the destruction was contained by sorcery, and to\nAdamat’s eyes it looked as if no one was harmed.\nWhen the dust had settled, Adamat turned his eyes back on Claremonte.\nOnce again the man stepped to the prow of the boat to address the crowd.\nHe raised his arms.\n“This is only the beginning, my brothers and sisters.

The bullet slammed into the Warden’s\nshoulder, making him jerk. The twisted creature drew his sword and\nbounded up the stairs toward Tamas.\nTamas drew his sword and charged the Warden. The creature bellowed a\nchallenge, and Tamas answered with a silent snarl. Their swords clashed\nloudly once, twice, and then Tamas was inside the Warden’s guard. He\ngrabbed the Warden by the neck, feeling the strength of the powder\ncoursing through him, and tossed it off the hallway balcony to the foyer\nbelow.\nNikslaus had rolled down the stairs and picked himself off the marble\nfloors. One of his gloves had come off—Tamas paused at that. No, the\nwhole hand had come off.\nHe had been wearing false hands. A ruse to fool his own soldiers into\nthinking he could still do sorcery? Perhaps. Tamas didn’t care as he flew\ndown the stairs three at a time.\nNikslaus fled toward the front door, gesturing wildly at Tamas and\nscreaming at his men, “Kill him!”\nThe air was already bitter with the scent of black powder. Tamas felt a\nsurge of energy, and an explosion tore through the Kez soldiers as Vlora\nignited their powder.\nSoldiers came at him with swords drawn. Nikslaus was smart enough to\nkeep some of his soldiers without powder, it seemed. Tamas caught a thrust\nwith the tip of his sword, flipping it to the side and ramming his own sword\ninto the soldier’s chest. He kept moving forward. Nikslaus backed away\nfrom him, face painted with terror.\nA knife spun past Tamas’s face and clattered against the marble banister\nbehind him. He spun toward its owner, a Warden, and grunted as the\ncreature hit him with the force of a charging bull.\nTamas felt himself lifted into the air and then slammed into the banister.\nIt cracked from the force of the blow, sending him and the Warden tumbling\nover the edge of the stairs and a short drop to the floor.\nHe felt the creature’s fingers close on his throat. Tamas grasped it by the\nwrist and slammed his other palm into the Warden’s elbow. The creature’s\narm snapped, bending ninety degrees the wrong way. Tamas grabbed the\nWarden by the lapels and kicked, flipping it off of him.\nBy the time Tamas had gotten back to his feet, the room was filled with\nsoldiers. Most of them were dead or dying, shot by a mage or blown to bits\nby their own powder horns, but there were still enough of the Kez to get in\nthe way.\nTamas spotted Nikslaus as he fled down a side hallway.\n“Pit!” Tamas swore. He lurched to his feet only to fall again. The\nWarden with the broken arm had grabbed Tamas’s leg. It swung a knife at\nTamas.\nTamas jerked his leg out of the Warden’s grip, and its knife slammed\ninto the marble floor.

It\nwas a long hall, perhaps a hundred yards into another wing of the manor.\nTamas opened his third eye, fighting off the dizziness, and searched for\nsigns of Wardens or the Privileged.\nA soldier leapt out of a side room with a shout. Tamas closed his third\neye, reeling back as he felt a sword slice cleanly along the side of his\nstomach. He fended off another thrust and drew his second pistol, firing\nfrom the hip. The shot took the Kez soldier in the chest. The man lurched\nforward, then tried to step back. A look of surprise crossed his face as he\nfell to the ground.\nTamas left him where he was and sprinted along the hallway. The pain\nof his bad leg throbbed like the beat of a drum and the cut along his side\nstung in the open air. He slowed as he rounded the corner at the end of the\nhallway, only to find another hall leading off a hundred paces long.\nNo sign of Nikslaus.\n“Sir!” Vlora came up beside him, breathing hard.\n“He came this way,” he said.\nShe nodded and trotted out ahead of him.\nVlora was about fifteen paces ahead of him when a Warden burst out of\nthe cover of a doorway and slammed into her. His momentum took them\nboth across the hallway and out of sight, into another room.\n“Vlora!” Tamas ran forward, only to stop when a voice called out.\n“No closer.” Nikslaus. The voice came from just inside the doorway\nwhere Vlora and the Warden had disappeared.\n“I’m coming to kill you,” Tamas said.\n“Not if you want this one alive.”\nTamas looked down. Both pistols were spent. He might be able to angle\na bullet around the corner. No. He knew he could.\n“Vlora?” Tamas called out.\nNo answer.\n“If she’s dead,” Tamas said, “I’ve no reason to stop myself from coming\naround this corner.”\nTamas heard a deep, angry grunt, and then Vlora’s voice. “I’m all right,\nsir.”\n“For now,” Nikslaus said, “but if she bites my Warden again, I’ll let him\nsnap her neck. I’m using her as a shield, Tamas. If you angle a bullet around\nthat wall, it’ll hit her.”\nTamas sheathed his sword and drew a pistol. He reloaded quickly,\nsteadily, and then shoved it in his belt so he could reload the other.\n“How is your leg?” Nikslaus called. “I’m surprised you can put that\nmuch weight on it.”\n“It was healed by a god. It feels fantastic. How are your hands? Did"

Did\nKresimir grow them back for you?”\nTamas was satisfied to hear a low curse.\n“Surrender, Tamas, or I kill the girl.”\n“Kill her,” Tamas said. “I don’t care.”\n“I think you do. I recognize this one. Vlora. I never told you that was\none of my little schemes, did I? Having her seduced.” Tamas heard another\nlow grunt—the Warden—and then Nikslaus’s laugh. “You probably thought\nit was the nobility. Well, that’s what the fop thought, too.”\n“She betrayed Taniel,” Tamas said. “Like I said: kill her.”\nNikslaus clicked his tongue disapprovingly. “Oh, Tamas. I know\neverything about you. I know your hopes and your fears. I know your\nfavorites. She’s always been one of your favorites. Did you think about\nbedding her after Taniel canceled the wedding? I know you did. So\nsuddenly available. How that must have tempted you.”\nTamas opened his third eye and stepped away from the wall. He could\nsee Nikslaus’s bright glow in the Else through the wall. It was several dozen\npaces back from the corner. Closer, he could see the dull glow of the\nWarden and the barely perceptible glow that Vlora gave off in the Else. The\nWarden was using Vlora as a shield. Tamas would likely hit Vlora if he\ntried to angle a bullet around the corner.\n“Throw your pistol down, Tamas, and I’ll let her live,” Nikslaus said.\n“Why should I trust you?”\n“You’ve no choice. The courtyard is filling up with soldiers. I don’t care\nhow many mages you brought, you’re outnumbered and outmatched. You\nthrow down your weapons and come out, and I give my word that this girl\nlives.”\n“Why so magnanimous?” Tamas said. He drew his second pistol. He\naimed one at the glow of the Privileged and one at that of the Warden.\n“Not sure what’s come over me,” Nikslaus said. “Maybe it’s the\nprospect of your head on a pike!” His voice rose to a shout. “Think of it,\nTamas. Only a couple months ago, it was me trapped inside a manor, while\nyour soldiers filed into the courtyard. What a reversal of fortunes! Maybe\nI’ll cut off your hands before I kill you.”\nTamas examined the walls. Marble over limestone, most likely. To\npierce it, he’d have to put half a horn’s worth of powder behind a bullet, and\nconcentrate energy around the bullet to keep it from fragmenting. One, he\ncould do. Not two.\n“I wouldn’t take the time,” Tamas said. He lowered the pistol aimed at\nNikslaus and uncocked the hammer. He set it on the floor and slid it out into\nthe middle of the hall where the Warden could see it.\n“I’m unarmed. Now let her go,” Tamas said.\n“When I see you on your knees!” Nikslaus screamed."

Now let her go,” Tamas said.\n“When I see you on your knees!” Nikslaus screamed.\nTamas focused on the smudge of color in the Else that was the Warden.\nHe concentrated on his bullet, and set the barrel of his other pistol against\nthe wall and pulled the trigger.\nHe dropped the pistol as soon as he’d pulled the trigger and leapt and\nrolled into the hallway, snatching up the other pistol and coming up into a\ncrouch. The pistol kicked back in his hand as he touched the powder with\nhis mind.\nBoth shots had hit the Warden. The first, through the wall, had gone low,\ncutting through the creature’s neck. The second took it between the eyes,\njust over Vlora’s shoulder. The Warden collapsed backward, Vlora still in\nits grip.\nTamas caught sight of Nikslaus running across the room behind the\nWarden.\nTamas gently wrested Vlora from the dead Warden’s grip. The creature\nhad been holding a knife to her throat. She had a cut there, leaking crimson,\nbut Tamas could not tell how deep.\n“Vlora. Vlora!”\nHer eyes were slightly glazed, her face panicked. There was a shard of\nmarble embedded in her cheek. Tamas pulled it out, brushing her hair out of\nthe way with one hand.\nShe shook her head suddenly, as if coming out of a dream. “I’m alive,”\nshe said. “I’m alive. I’m fine.” She seemed to be speaking more to herself\nthan him.\nTamas removed a handkerchief from his pocket and pressed it to her\nthroat. She could still speak, so the cut wasn’t too deep. “Keep pressure on\nit.”\n“Go,” Vlora said. “Go after him.”\nTamas took off his greatcoat and wadded it into a ball. He lifted Vlora’s\nhead and put it underneath. “Andriya! Pit, where is he? Andriya!”\nLeone appeared suddenly, her bayoneted rifle held at the ready. She set\nher rifle on the ground and squatted beside Vlora.\n“Stay with her,” Tamas said. “Vidalslav makes the cleanest stitches.\nWhen the fighting dies down, make sure she sees Vlora first.”\nTamas retrieved his other pistol and checked the room. Nikslaus had fled\nthrough a side door. He caught sight of the Privileged running across the\nlawn, heading for the front gate.\n“Sir,” Leone said, “we’ve taken the house, but the courtyard is filled\nwith soldiers.”\nTamas dropped a bullet down the barrel of one of his pistols and\nrammed cotton batting down to keep it stable. “I don’t care,” he said. “I\nhave a man to kill.”\nTaniel sagged against the rough-hewn wood of the beam from which he\nhung, what little strength he had sapped from his struggles.\nHe’d tried to loosen his bonds.

Could he survive that far of a fall? Would he land, only to have\nthe Kez finish off his broken body?\nHow would Tamas have gotten out of this? The old bastard may have\nbeen mean, but he was clever, too.\nJulene had watched him struggle for all of an hour. She seemed amused\nby it, if anything, and the madness in her eyes seemed to come and go.\n“Why did he do this to you?” Taniel asked.\nJulene gave that choking laugh again. “I ask myself that every day.”\nThere’d be no help from her, Taniel decided. She was clearly as mad as\nthe god who put her there. He looked up at the hook from which he hung,\nand then toward the Adran camp. Even at this distance, without a powder\ntrance, he could tell that the General Staff was gathering. Equal commotion\nwas going through the Kez camp. Both sides were preparing for a parlay.\nWas that when Kresimir planned to kill them all?\n“Kresimir didn’t want to come back,” Julene said.\nTaniel turned his head sharply toward her. The madness was gone from\nher, and her eyes were suddenly lucid.\n“He wouldn’t have, if I hadn’t summoned him like I did,” she went on.\n“He doesn’t care that Tamas killed Manhouch. The fate of the mortals of\nthis world don’t concern him. I was so wrong.” Julene coughed, then\nswallowed hard, her broken face somehow twisting to look more bitter. “If I\nlive another twenty thousand years, I could not possibly make a mistake\nagain like I did by summoning Kresimir.” Her whole body shuddered, and\nshe threw back her head, moaning in agony.\nTaniel turned away. He couldn’t look at that. Cruelty for the sake of\ncruelty. Gods, it seemed, were capable of pettiness just as much as the next\nman.\nTaniel scanned the Adran camp, looking for familiar faces. It was too far\nto make out individuals.\nBy now Ka-poel would know what had happened to him.\nIf she was still alive.\nTaniel flexed his arms and pulled against his rope. He lifted a few\ninches, and then fell back. His struggling all morning had exhausted him.\n“What are you doing, powder mage?” Julene said.\n“Trying to get away.” He pulled himself up again. He gained an inch.\nMaybe two.\n“You can’t. You fall from here and you’ll break your legs.”\n“Maybe I can shimmy down.”\nJulene rasped out a laugh. “They’ll just put you back up.”\nTaniel spotted a movement in the Kez camp. It wasn’t significant, and he\nknew not what drew his eye in that direction. He willed himself to see\nfarther.\nA small figure was winding its way through the soldiers. A hooded\nshape—it could have been a child. But Taniel knew that build. He knew\nhow to read the sway of the walk, from long familiarity.\nKa-poel. What was she doing here? She had to get out, to leave the camp\nbefore she was caught!"

The soldiers were preparing for something\nbig. She was a few hundred yards away, just working her way through the\ncamp in no particular hurry.\nTaniel flexed again. He lifted himself up until his face nearly touched\nthe hook. Every fiber of his body trembled from the effort, his bruised flesh\ncrying out in pain.\n“What do you plan to do, powder mage?” Julene’s voice was steady. The\nrasp was gone. A glance in her direction showed her staring intently at him.\nTaniel let himself drop, gasping at the effort. “I’m going to kill\nKresimir.”\nKa-poel was getting closer. What did she plan on doing when she got to\nhim? Her sorcery couldn’t get him off this beam.\nIn the distance, in the no-man’s-land between the armies, Taniel saw a\nlone figure head out from the Adran camp. Tall and fat, wearing a white\napron. Mihali.\nIt only took a moment of searching before Taniel found Kresimir\nstanding at the head of the Kez lines. The god had changed his bloody\nclothes for clean ones and still wore his mask. He, too, began heading\ntoward the middle of the field.\nTaniel lifted himself up until he reached the hook. Inch by inch, he felt\nwith his fingers. His struggles had loosened his bonds. Perhaps not enough\nto slip out of them, but…\nTaniel grasped the hook with both hands and placed his feet flat against\nthe beam. He pressed with his legs, working his toes against the wood like\nthe feet of a clamp. Firmly braced on the beam, he pushed up, willing even\nmore strength from his already burning thighs. Just a couple inches was all\nhe needed…\nAnd he was there! He worked his bonds along the curve of the hook\nuntil suddenly the rope was free. A wave of giddiness swept over him,\nnearly making him fall. He was free of the hook! He could drop from this\nheight anytime he wanted.\nHe looked down and his stomach lurched. That didn’t seem like such a\ngood idea.\nGrasping the hook, he turned himself around so that he was facing the\nbeam.\n“You’re a stubborn bastard,” Julene said.\nTaniel didn’t answer her. Slowly, he began working his way down the\nrough-hewn beam. He dug his fingernails and the toes of his boots into the\nwood as if he were scaling a cliff face. Every muscle protested in agony.\nThere was no way he could scrape his fingernails the entire way down.\nHe worked down the first few feet and stopped, gasping for breath.\n“Can you really do it?” Julene asked. “Kill Kresimir?”\nTaniel worked his way down another foot.\n“It’s the savage, isn’t it? By pit, her sorcery is potent. She might be able\nto kill him.”\nTaniel remained silent. Another foot. He could do it.\nHe looked down. There were four guards stationed around the base of\nthe beam.

He’d have to get near enough\nto the ground to drop on one of them, and then fight the other three—his\nhands still bound. Ka-poel would be there by now. She could…\nShe entered his line of vision suddenly, approaching one of the guards at\na quick pace. The guard straightened and said something, holding out a\nhand. Her small fist darted out, slamming into his throat. The guard fell to\nhis knees, gurgling blood.\nAnother foot. Taniel’s heart thundered in his ears. He had to keep\nmoving.\n“Make me a promise,” Julene said.\n“Faster, faster, I have to go faster,” Taniel whispered to himself.\n“Promise you’ll kill me. Shoot me in the head with one of those bullets\nyou used to blind Kresimir. I won’t survive that. Not in my weakened state.\nConsider it an act of vengeance, if you like.”\nTaniel looked down. Ka-poel was grappling with another guard. A third\ngrabbed her by the shoulders.\n“Promise me, Taniel.”\nTaniel was struck by the pleading in her voice. He stopped just long\nenough to look at her. “I promise,” he said.\nJulene gave a shrill laugh.\nBelow, the three guards had forced Ka-poel to the ground. Taniel took a\ndeep breath and closed his eyes.\nThen he let himself fall.\nCHAPTER\n44\nT\namas followed Nikslaus through a side door of the mansion and out onto\nthe lawn. The ground was soaked, rain coming down in thick sheets. Even\nthough it was only half past six in the afternoon, the sky was darkening. A\ngrandfather of a storm was blowing in.\nThe Privileged was just rounding the corner to the front of the mansion\nas Tamas came out the door. He set off in pursuit.\nHe reached the corner of the building and stopped. A quick glance\nshowed fifty, maybe sixty soldiers in the courtyard. They hid behind\ncarriages and sculptures, exchanging fire with the powder mages inside.\nNikslaus leapt onto the running board of a carriage, hooking one arm\nthrough a handstrap. Tamas could hear him yelling between the volleys of\nmusket fire:\n“Go!” Nikslaus pounded on the roof of the carriage with one stub and\nducked inside. The carriage took off down the short drive and turned into\nthe street.\nA bullet took a chip out of the masonry just above Tamas’s head. He\nflinched away. They’d spotted him.\nTamas examined the soldiers. Too many. Even at his best. Most of his\npowder was gone, used in that shot through the limestone. He checked the\ngarden wall about fifty paces away. Too tall.\nTamas heard a commotion around the corner and risked a glance.\nThe powder horn of a Kez soldier suddenly exploded, ripping the man in\nhalf. Another followed, and then another. Men began to throw their\nmuskets, horns, and charges away to avoid being killed. It had to be Vlora.\nOnly she had the range igniting powder to kill men all the way by the gates."

It was\ndangerously stupid to ignite powder blind, both for yourself and for your\nallies.\nThe front doors of the manor suddenly burst open. Andriya flew through\nthem. He held a bayoneted rifle in both hands and was screaming at the top\nof his lungs. His eyes were wild, his hat gone, his greatcoat billowing\naround him. He leapt on the closest Kez soldier, skewering the man\nmercilessly.\nIt was the best Tamas was going to get for cover.\nHe set off at a sprint across the lawn, cutting behind the Kez soldiers.\nMost ignored him, their eyes all on Andriya.\nTamas neared the gate. A soldier turned toward Tamas, desperately\ntrying to fix the bayonet to the end of his musket. Tamas sprinted toward\nthe soldier, put his foot on a rock near the driveway, and launched himself\nin the air. He cracked the man in the chin with one boot and was past him\nand through the gate.\nThere were more soldiers in the street. Tamas realized he was alone in\nthe midst of twenty or more Kez infantry.\nHe ignited all the powder nearby. He used his mind to warp the blast\naway from him, but he’d never been as good at that as some, and the shock\nwave knocked him off his feet.\nTamas crawled to his knees, then to his feet. He tried to shake the\ndizziness. The ache of his leg suddenly pushed through his powder trance,\nmaking him stumble as he searched for Nikslaus’s carriage.\nThe ground was littered with bodies. Nearly every one of the soldiers\nhad been killed outright. Only a few moaned in agony, clutching at missing\nlimbs. Gore and blood filled the street. The sight of it—the smell of powder\nand blood—made him retch.\nThere, at the end of the street. Nikslaus’s carriage was heading down the\nmain thoroughfare of the city toward the mountains, disappearing into the\ndeluge. Tamas could see the driver frantically whipping his horses.\nCivilians leapt out of the way as the carriage surged forward.\nTamas tried to run. He lurched sideways, catching himself with one hand\non the lip of an overflowing rain barrel. He pushed back to standing and\nkept on, moving slower, trying to get his head to stop pounding. He felt\nsomething dribble down his cheek and touched his face. There was blood\nthere. It felt like it was coming from his ears.\nHe couldn’t stop now. The carriage was getting farther and farther away.\nBefore too long it would break out of the city and head up into the\nmountains. Nikslaus would get away again.\nTamas crunched one of his few remaining powder charges between his\nteeth and forced himself to run.\nThe street cobbles pounded away beneath his feet. He let the powder\ntrance take him over completely, feeling the burn of powder through his\nveins. Shops and houses flew by him.

His hat\ncame off, whipped away by the wind, and rain pelted his face.\nThe carriage reached the eastern edge of the city well ahead of him.\nTamas could see the land in his mind’s eye. A few hundred yards of sloped\nparade grounds, filled with Nikslaus’s soldiers and their ill-gotten gains\nfrom looting the city, before the mountains rose steeply and the road entered\na valley, where it crept gradually higher into the Charwood Pile.\nThere’d be thousands of Kez soldiers in that parade ground. Tamas had\nto kill Nikslaus before he reached the mountain. He stopped to catch his\nbreath, and leveled his pistol at the back of the carriage. No. Not now. Too\nmany Deliv in the streets. He needed a clean shot.\nTamas neared the edge of the city. The downpour had become a deluge.\nThe carriage was lost to him, but he had no doubt of Nikslaus’s destination.\nNo doubt, also, that the powder in his pistol pan was wet.\nA crowd began to emerge out of the rain, and the sound of shouting\nsuddenly rose above the thrum of rain against the ground. There were men\neverywhere, choking the street.\nIt took Tamas a few moments to realize they were fighting. A brawl?\nNo. A battle, a bloody melee. Every one of them wore the dark-blue coats\nof Adran infantry, but he was able to make out two sides. It appeared that\nevery man on one side had torn off their white shirtsleeves and wrapped\nthem around their right arms.\nTamas grabbed a man without a white band on his arm. “Kez?” he asked\nin Kez.\nThe man seemed taken off guard. “Yes,” he answered in Kez.\nTamas ran the man through and shoved him off the end of his sword\nwith one boot. He turned just in time to parry the thrust of a bayonet. It\ncame from a soldier with a white band. The soldier was about to lunge\nagain when he came up short. “Field Marshal!”\n“Where’s Colonel Olem?” Tamas asked, saying a silent prayer of thanks\nthat his men recognized him.\n“No idea, sir. He led the charge.”\n“The bands?” Tamas gestured to the shirtsleeve tied around the soldier’s\narm.\n“Colonel Olem’s idea, sir. Keep us all straight.”\n“Good.”\nThe soldier suddenly stripped off his jacket and tore the other arm off his\nundershirt. “Here, sir.”\nTamas let him wrap his arm. “Thank you. What are your orders?”\n“Slaughter the Kez,” the soldier said. He lifted his rifle and charged off\nwith a yell.\nTamas stood, still in a little bit of shock at the melee. He’d not heard\nhorns or drums or seen any kind of panic in the Kez soldiers that said that\nthe Seventh and Ninth had arrived. Didn’t Nikslaus have scouts?

Olem must have convinced the other generals and colonels of\nthe need to charge straight in.\nIt was a commander’s nightmare. Already the parade grounds had been\nturned into a muddy quagmire. The downpour was so thick Tamas could\nbarely see twenty feet in front of him.\nNikslaus’s carriage must have been slowed by the rain. It had to have\nfollowed the road, otherwise it would get bogged down in the mud.\nTamas set off at a trot along the cobbles.\nThe fighting raged all around him. The sound of screams and yells, the\nring of sword on sword, rose intermittently above the pounding rain. The\ncobbles were slick with rain and blood.\nHe fought his way through, sword out in front of him, right arm raised\nso that his soldiers could see the dirty white band tied just below his\nshoulder. He shoved and stabbed, paused for only a moment to urge on\ninfantry from the Seventh, and then moved on down the road, searching for\nNikslaus.\nHow had the duke’s carriage gotten through this melee? Had his driver\nshoved forward, trampling soldiers on both sides, desperate to escape\nTamas’s wrath? Or had the duke given him the slip, and somehow\nconcealed the carriage from Tamas in order to escape back into the city?\nTamas caught sight of Colonel Arbor, his uniform soaked through,\nholding his false teeth in one hand while he used his cavalry saber to give a\npit of a fight to a Kez captain. A particularly thick sheet of rain came down,\nconcealing the colonel. Both men were gone the next time Tamas looked.\nTamas fended off a bayonet thrust and opened his third eye, fighting the\ndizziness that came with it. Specks of color rose out of the storm, dancing\nlike candles in a drafty room—Knacked soldiers on both sides of the\nfighting.\nHe swept his gaze back toward the city. Nothing that way but Knacked.\nNo Privileged. A few Wardens.\nThe rain fell harder. Lightning lit the darkening sky, giving Tamas a\nbrief glimpse through the deluge and across the entire battlefield.\nMen struggled in the mire of the parade field, boots sliding and\nsquelching. They were a sea of blue uniforms, drenched and muddy. Tamas\nwondered if the strips of white were even helping them tell friend from foe.\nHe guessed that thousands would die this night to the swords of their own\ncomrades.\nLightning flashed again, and Tamas saw something forty or fifty paces\nahead, just off the road. A crash of thunder followed immediately. He felt\nhis whole chest shake from the sound. His third eye had shown him a fire\namong the wreckage—not of flame but of light in the Else that betrayed the\npresence of a Privileged.\nWhat he’d seen a moment before resolved itself into the wreckage of a\ncarriage as Tamas drew closer.\nIt looked like the driver had swerved, one wheel going off the cobbles\nand into the soft, wet mud. The carriage had tipped over and slid down an\nembankment, ending top-down in two feet of water at the bottom of a ditch,\nwheels still spinning."

No sign of Nikslaus. Tamas’s third eye told him the\nPrivileged was still within. No Wardens, either. Was this an accident? Or a\ntrap?\nTamas approached, one hand on the muddy bank to keep his balance, the\nother holding one of his pistols. The powder in the pan might be wet, but\nthe residue in the muzzle would still be dry and he could light it with a\nthought. One shot. That’s all he had.\nThat’s all he needed.\nTamas wrenched the door off the carriage and stooped to look inside.\nNikslaus lay in the rising water of the ditch, his back against one side of the\ncarriage. Tamas snagged the Privileged’s coat with one hand and pulled him\nthrough the door, out of the water, and up onto the bank.\n“I’m going to watch you die,” Tamas shouted above the rain. He\nrammed his pistol into his belt and grasped Nikslaus’s coat by the collar.\nHe’d do it with his own hands. For Erika. For Sabon. For all the powder\nmages who’d died in the duke’s grasp.\nTamas blinked the rain out of his eyes as he lifted Nikslaus up in front of\nhim. Once more, to look his enemy in the eye.\nSomething was wrong.\nNikslaus’s head lolled at an impossible angle, eyes staring blankly\ntoward the sky. Muddy water poured from his mouth.\nThe man who’d haunted Tamas’s dreams for well over a decade—who’d\nkilled his wife and his best friend and caused a war that threatened to\ndestroy his country—had broken his neck and drowned in a ditch.\nTamas dropped the body. He opened his third eye, just to be sure. The\nlight of the Else was gone from Nikslaus.\nHe took a few steps back, stumbling in the water, and fell against the\nopposite bank. Nikslaus had died, from an accident no less, just moments\nbefore Tamas reached him.\nTamas hammered his fists into the mud. He kicked a carriage wheel hard\nenough to break several spokes and bend the iron strake that held the wheel\ntogether. He slipped in the mud, falling to his knees.\nHe slumped forward in the same water that had just drowned Nikslaus,\nrain falling in his eyes. He still had his shot—for a moment, he considered\nputting it in his own brain. He’d lost Erika, he’d lost Sabon, he’d lost\nGavril. And now he would never avenge them. He gripped his pistol,\nTaniel’s gift. No. Not everything. He still had his son.\n“Please! Please, help me!”\nThe call brought Tamas back.

It looked like he’d managed\nto free all but two of the panicked beasts.\nThe fighting continued around them. Tamas knew he needed to get back\nto level ground and find his officers, to bring some kind of cohesion into the\nmelee. With Nikslaus gone, the Kez might very well break and run.\nA horse screamed, and Tamas again heard the sound of the pleading\ndriver.\nTamas climbed the wreckage of the carriage and lowered himself down\njust behind the driver. The man was on his knees, trying to dodge thrashing\nhooves as he cast about in the water for his knife.\n“Here,” Tamas said. He pushed the man aside and drew his sword, and\nwith two quick strokes, the horses were free. They rolled to their feet and\nwere off, splashing upstream through the ditch, away from the carriage.\nThey would be impossible to catch until they calmed down, and one of\nthem might very well break a leg in these conditions, but at least they were\nfree.\nTamas turned to the driver. The man cowered before him, blinking in\nfear at the epaulets on Tamas’s uniform.\n“Thank you, sir,” the driver said.\n“Find the closest Adran officer,” Tamas plucked at the white sleeve tied\naround his arm, “and surrender yourself. That’s the only way you’ll survive\nthe night.”\nThe driver ducked his head, the water dripping off the brim of his forage\ncap. “Sir, thank you, sir. The duke, is he…?”\n“He’s dead.”\nIt may have been the darkness and the rain, but it seemed that relief\nwashed across the driver’s face. “What about the powder, sir?”\n“Powder?” Tamas asked. “What powder?”\nThe color drained from the driver’s face. “The whole city. It’s filled with\nit. The duke was going to kill all those people!”\nTamas turned toward Alvation. Black powder! That’s why he sensed so\nmuch. Nikslaus must have strung it through every building, ready to be\ntouched off at his command. That’s the only way he could have leveled the\ncity in one night.\nTamas struggled up the embankment and began to run back the way he’d\ncome. The Wardens would probably set it off, even if it meant dying\nthemselves. No hope that a conscientious officer would countermand\nNikslaus’s orders.\nThere’d have to be tens of thousands of pounds of powder throughout\nAlvation to destroy the whole city. They could have set it off and then swept\nthrough the wreckage, slaughtering the survivors. What better way to frame\nAdro for the attack? No one would suspect a Privileged like Nikslaus of\nusing black powder.\nTamas would never make it in time."

No one would suspect a Privileged like Nikslaus of\nusing black powder.\nTamas would never make it in time.\nThe first blast was so large it shook the ground. A cloud of fire rose up\nover the market district as high as a four-story building and the shock wave\nknocked hundreds of fighting soldiers off their feet.\nTamas tripped and fell, bashing one knee on the cobbles. He was back\nrunning with a limp a moment later, eyes on the city, waiting for the next\nblast. The fire was gone almost as quickly as it had risen, but Tamas could\nsee the outline of a plume of smoke and steam rising into the evening sky.\nThat wouldn’t be all of it. He had to get back into the city and…\nAnd what? Stop the Wardens from lighting the powder? He didn’t know\nwhere they were, and the city was quite large. He could try to find the\npowder caches, but no doubt the Wardens would have blown them up\nalready.\nAnother blast rocked the city, this time on its far side. Tamas was ready\nfor it, and managed to keep his footing despite the rumbling of the ground.\nEach one of the blasts was no doubt killing hundreds. He could suppress\nthe blasts, or redirect the energy, but trying to contain that much powder\nwould be like boiling water in a sealed teakettle—it would rip him apart.\nTamas entered the city, shoving his way through the melee, and spread\nhis senses outward. There was a munitions dump on the next street, he\ncould feel it. Enough powder to level ten city blocks.\nTamas sensed the match being touched to powder somewhere inside the\nmunitions dump, and already it was too late to suppress the explosion. The\npressure built in Tamas’s mind, the explosion rocketing outward from the\ngunpowder.\nTamas grasped the energy, ready to redirect it. His mind reached out for\nthe rest of the powder to see how much he’d have to stop.\nA scattering of powder charges was easy. A powder horn was no\nproblem. Even a barrel of powder, Tamas could redirect.\nFifty barrels of powder went at once.\nTamas grasped the energy and pushed it straight down beneath him. It\nfelt like he’d attached a hundred cannons to his boots and fired them all at\nonce. The energy coursed out, throwing up dirt, rock, and cobbles, and\nTamas could see the shocked faces of the soldiers closest to him just before\nthey were vaporized in an instant.\nIt was too much. He couldn’t contain so much powder. His body\ngroaned and twisted, and his skin felt ready to split.\nAll of this took less than a heartbeat. Tamas could feel consciousness\nslipping, and with it the will to control the force of the explosion.\nHe’d failed his wife. He’d failed his soldiers, his son, the people of\nAlvation and Adro.\nHe’d failed them all.\nThe world went black.\nTaniel landed square on the shoulders of one of his guards. The man\ncrumpled beneath him, absorbing some of the impact, but Taniel’s legs still\nbuckled beneath him and he rolled, howling in pain, up against the base of\nthe beam."

He lashed out with one boot, kicking in the\nside of a guard’s knee, and then slammed his tied hands across the face of\nthe other.\nKa-poel’s hood had fallen back in the struggle. Her eyes were wide, her\nshort red hair wild. She lifted her chin under Taniel’s brief scrutiny. The\nmoment was over, and she wicked a drop of blood off the end of her long\nneedle and darted forward, drawing her belt knife to saw through Taniel’s\nbonds.\n“You shouldn’t have come,” Taniel said.\nShe finished cutting his bonds and thrust a powder horn into his hands.\nHe tore the plug out with his teeth. The powder poured into his mouth,\ntasting sulfuric on his tongue, crunching between his teeth. He sputtered\nand choked, but forced himself to swallow a mouthful of black powder.\nThe powder trance raced through him, warming his body, tightening his\nmuscles. The pain of his wounds and bruises faded to the back of his mind.\nKa-poel finished dispatching the four guards with her belt knife. She\nstood up and sniffed, wiping the blood off.\nTaniel looked around. Despite the activity in the camp, plenty of soldiers\nhad begun to notice their fight. An officer was running toward them at the\nhead of a squad, pointing and shouting for others.\nTaniel rubbed at his wrists. He and Ka-poel were in the center of the Kez\narmy, completely cut off and with no hope of rescue. He’d have to kill a\nhundred thousand men to escape this.\n“Pole.” He bent at the knee, fetching one of the guard’s muskets, and\nwinced. Not enough powder in the world to completely drown out the pain.\n“I don’t think we’re going to get through this.”\nKa-poel surveyed the Kez army, like a general surveying her troops.\nTaniel hefted the musket. It was a cheap make, nothing like the Hrusch\nrifle he was used to. He retrieved the bayonet from the guard’s kit and fitted\nit into place. It would have to do. The Kez were coming—fifty, maybe more\nnow. And any fighting would bring the notice of the rest of the army.\n“Pole,” he said, “I love you.”\nKa-poel touched one finger to her heart, then pointed at him. She tossed\nher satchel on the ground in front of her. It landed with the top open, and\nshe lifted her hand.\nHer dolls began to rise out of the satchel. Taniel remembered the fight at\nKresim Kurga and the power she had shown.\n“It won’t be enough this time, Pole.”\nThe dolls kept coming. Ten. Fifty. A hundred.

A Kez captain lifted his hand. “Load!”\nTaniel ignited their powder with a thought. Muskets ripped apart and\npowder horns exploded and the air filled with the scent of spent powder and\nthe sound of screams.\n“A powder mage!” someone yelled. The call went on through the camp\nas soldiers discarded their muskets and scrambled for swords and knives.\nMore men came running—first a trickle, then in force. Taniel gripped the\nbarrel of his musket and prepared for the fight.\nIt started as a small, out-of-place movement in the corner of his eye. A\nKez soldier stopped in the middle of the camp and rammed his bayonet into\nthe neck of the man beside him. The soldier seemed perplexed at what he’d\njust done before he suddenly turned and cracked his musket butt across the\nteeth of another Kez infantryman.\nAnother soldier suddenly held his powder horn up to his flintlock and\npulled the trigger, blowing himself and three of his companions to the pit.\nFistfights broke out, and the tide of Kez soldiers heading toward Taniel\nand Ka-poel began to ebb as they turned on one another.\nKa-poel stood, legs braced, eyes on her dolls as if she were examining a\nchessboard. Around her, the dolls were moving of their own accord. Some\nof them fought each other, while others tumbled and stabbed at shadows.\nTaniel felt a terrible fear grip him. She was controlling an entire army,\nthousands all at once!\nAn unoccupied infantryman charged Taniel.\nTaniel slapped aside the thrust of a bayonet and rammed his own\nthrough the infantryman’s eye.\n“We should go,” he said to Pole. “You can’t keep them forever.”\nKa-poel caught his sleeve and made the shape of a gun with one hand,\npointing at her dolls.\n“You want me to shoot them?”\nA nod.\nTaniel dropped the butt of the musket to the ground and quickly loaded\nit. Lifting it to his shoulder, he looked to Ka-poel for confirmation.\nShe made a hurrying motion with one hand.\nTaniel aimed at her field of dolls and pulled the trigger.\nA sound like thunder cracked out of the late-morning air, sending Kez\nsoldiers diving for cover. A nearby soldier suddenly splattered across a tent\nlike he’d been hit by a cannonball. Taniel could hear the cries of dismay,\nand someone shouted, “Artillery fire!”\nKa-poel threw her head back in a silent laugh.\n“That’s sadistic,” Taniel said. He grabbed her by the hand. “Let’s go.”\nThey raced through the Kez camp, heading toward the eastern\nmountains that lined Surkov’s Alley. Ka-poel’s dolls kept pace with them,\nfloating, fighting shadows. By the time they reached the edge of the Kez\ncamp and began to climb the nearest hill, the number of dolls had\ndiminished.\nKa-poel panted heavily as they climbed. Taniel looked behind them.

He pulled on her\narm and felt her sag to the ground, her eyes suddenly cloudy from\nexhaustion. Taniel swung his musket onto his shoulder and then lifted Ka-\npoel in his arms, continuing to run.\nThe hill grew steeper, and Taniel soon found himself climbing more than\nrunning. He was forced to set Ka-poel on a large rock in the scree and pause\nto rest, turning to look at the valley.\nThey weren’t being chased.\nThe entire Kez camp was in an uproar. Brother fought brother. A weak\nPrivileged was slinging sorcery in a panic. Wardens were trying to restore\norder by killing “ringleaders” in a perceived uprising among the troops—it\nonly added to the chaos.\nAll because of Ka-poel’s dolls.\nTaniel uncorked his powder horn and poured a measure onto the back of\nhis hand. He snorted it. The immediate danger may have passed, but the\nKez could still send infantry or even riders after them. There’d be no getting\naway if they did. He could feel fatigue circling him, like a pack of wolves\naround a wounded deer. The burning flame of his powder trance would go\nout soon. No amount of fuel would keep it going, and then he would be\nuseless.\nHe and Ka-poel would need to walk the steepest part of the scree north\nfor over three miles to get even with the Adran camp.\nThen there was the matter of the traitor Hilanska.\nNear the front line, the chaos seemed the least pronounced, and plenty of\nthe Kez soldiers were still watching as Kresimir and Mihali spoke alone\nbetween the camps. The two gods faced each other, no more than a few feet\napart. Taniel would have given a fair amount to read their lips. Neither\nseemed to notice or care about the confusion in the Kez camp.\nMihali reached out, resting a hand on Kresimir’s shoulder.\nKresimir shrugged it off.\nMihali spread his hands in a calming gesture. Kresimir raised one hand\nin the air, pointing at the sky, shouting something.\nMihali kept speaking. His lips barely moved and his face was serene.\nIt was several minutes that Mihali spoke. Much to Taniel’s surprise,\nKresimir seemed to listen. The god’s hand fell to his side.\nBack at the camp, chaos continued. Ka-poel’s floating dolls had\ndwindled to no more than a few dozen. She sat up, looking haggard and\nbruised, but a victorious smile played on her lips. Her attention seemed to\nbe focused on the last dolls, and they were not disappearing as quickly as\nthe earlier ones. She was fighting hard to keep those last few puppets alive.\nTaniel watched the two gods. Kresimir and Mihali had edged closer to\neach other. Mihali was pointing to his opposite hand as if explaining\nsomething. Kresimir listened, brow furrowed.\nMihali appeared to finish his explanation.\nKresimir shook his head adamantly.\nMihali frowned. A sad smile crept onto his face and he opened his arms."

A sad smile crept onto his face and he opened his arms.\nTaniel suddenly felt his heart beating faster. He lifted his musket to his\nshoulder and sighted down the barrel at Kresimir. Two miles. Not a hard\nshot for him, but the bullet was a regular ball and it would take far too long\nto reach Kresimir. Taniel could only provide a distraction.\nKresimir suddenly threw his arms wide. For a brief moment, he looked\nas if he was ready to embrace his brother.\nTaniel clutched his hands to his face and stumbled back, falling to the\nground as a light brighter than a thousand suns erupted from Kresimir.\nTaniel braced himself, waiting for a shock wave and the deafening boom of\nan explosion.\nNeither came. The light blazed on so brightly that though Taniel covered\nhis face, he still felt as if he was staring into the heart of the sun.\nA hand touched him. He reached out, grabbing Ka-poel. What did she\nsee? Was there anything to see? She had to be as blind as he was. He pulled\nher to him and clutched her to his chest, trying to protect her eyes from the\nblaze. Sweet gods, what was this sorcery?\nTaniel felt the brightness begin to fade after what seemed an eternity.\nFear crept through him when he opened his eyes and saw nothing. Had he\nbeen blinded?\nIt must have been twenty minutes before shapes began to manifest\nthemselves in his vision. He blinked rapidly, trying to dispel pools of color,\ntrying to grasp what he’d just seen. That blaze—so bright and intense, but\nwithout heat or sound. Not an explosion.\nTaniel tried to recall his knowledge of Privileged sorcery. What had\nKresimir done?\nSlowly, it dawned on him.\nKresimir had opened the Else itself to the world.\nTaniel’s returning sight began to show him that both the Kez and Adran\ncamps were in chaos now. It seemed that no one could see. Hundreds of\nthousands of men crept on their hands and knees, wailing and crying out.\nIn the center of the field, positioned between the two camps, Kresimir\nstood alone. Mihali was completely gone, not even ash where he’d once\nstood. Kresimir’s mouth was open, his face frozen in a silent scream.\nTaniel watched as Kresimir’s shoulders slumped. Kresimir stared blindly\nfor a moment at the spot where Mihali had been. Then the god dropped to\nhis knees and wept.\nTaniel sagged against the mountainside, overcome with exaustion, his\nbody racked with the pain of his wounds. A few minutes passed in silence\nbefore he looked down at his bloody, vomit-stained shirt. There was a\nrushing sound in his ears, and his hands shook with sudden excitement.\n“Pole,” he said. “My shirt is soaked with Kresimir’s blood.”\nAdamat couldn’t take his eyes off Lord Claremonte as he finished his\nspeech.

Someone near Adamat\ntold the woman next to him that Claremonte had a point. A rising sense of\nindignation washed through the assembled masses, and Adamat knew that\nClaremonte had convinced them. Maybe not all of them. Maybe not now.\nBut the few screams of protest when Claremonte’s Privileged destroyed the\nKresim Cathedral had been stifled quickly.\nAll up and down the Ad, Brudanian soldiers pushed their longboats up\nonto the riverbank and disembarked. At quick glance they seemed to be\nworking in teams of about fifteen, each one accompanied by a Privileged.\nThey carried bayoneted muskets and barrels of black powder, and Adamat\nsaw the first team reach a church on the other side of the Ad and begin\npushing people away.\nThey were preparing it for demolition.\nIf Adamat wasn’t so horrified he’d be impressed. Claremonte had\narrived with reinforcements and supplies, given a brilliant speech for his\nministerial candidacy, and now he was setting about destroying the religious\nbuildings of Adro. He’d taken the horror of the people—the fear of the\nBrudanians invading the capital—and turned it on its head. Everyone would\nbe so relieved that Claremonte was not pillaging the city that he could do\njust about anything he wanted.\nAdamat wasn’t a religious man by any stretch, but he wanted to rush to\nthe nearest church and stop the soldiers from destroying it. These were\nhistorical icons, some of them close to a thousand years old! He had the\nfeeling that any move to stop the soldiers would see him killed.\nLess than forty paces away, Claremonte’s longboat was pushed onto the\nbank. Ricard was already hurrying toward it, his assistants and bodyguards\nfollowing cautiously. Adamat shouted at him to stop.\nA sailor helped Claremonte onto the muddy ground and then up the\nshore and onto the street.\nAdamat knew from the set of Ricard’s shoulders that he was about to do\nsomething stupid.\n“Fell! Grab him!”\nIt was too late. Ricard cocked his fist back and punched Claremonte in\nthe nose, dropping him like a sack of potatoes.\nBrudanian soldiers surged forward, and Claremonte’s Privileged raised a\ngloved hand, fingers held together as if about to snap them. Adamat’s heart\nleapt into his throat.\n“Stop!” Claremonte climbed to his feet. He laid a calming hand on the\nPrivileged’s arm. “No need for violence,” he said, holding his nose with two\nfingers.\n“What the pit do you think you’re doing?” Ricard demanded, cocking\nhis arm back as if about to swing again.\n“Doing?” Claremonte said as he tilted his head back to keep his nose\nfrom bleeding. “I’m running for First Minister of Adro. You are Ricard\nTumblar, I presume?”\n“Yes,” Ricard said icily.\nClaremonte stuck his hand out. “Lord Claremonte. It’s a delight to meet\nyou.”\n“That delight,” Ricard said, “is not shared.”"

That’s the kind of thing friends do.” Claremonte’s\nsmile had dropped on one side—only slightly, but it now came across as a\nleer. His eyes swept past Ricard and Fell and over the other union bosses\nand came to rest on Adamat. The corner of his mouth lifted back into a full\nsmile. “Really,” he said, still speaking to Ricard, “I must thank you for that.\nNow if you’ll excuse me, I have an election to win.”\nTamas felt the familiar jolt and rocking of a carriage as he fought his way\nback to consciousness.\nIt brought a panic in him. Where was he being taken? Who was driving\nthe carriage? Where were his men?\nMemory of the battle outside of Alvation, of finding Nikslaus’s body,\nand of trying to stop the explosion of thousands of pounds of gunpowder all\ncame back to Tamas at once.\nHe was on his back, and when he opened his eyes, he stared up at the\nroof of a stagecoach. It was light outside, so he must have been out for\nsome time. The air was cool and thin, and that brought another wave of\nworry to Tamas’s muddled mind. Was it winter? Had he been out for\nmonths?\nHis arms wouldn’t move on his command. After fighting down yet more\npanic, he decided that yes, his arms could move but they were restrained,\nand it was a struggle just to shift. Had he been taken captive by the Kez?\nThe first face that Tamas saw was not one he expected.\nIt belonged to an ebony-skinned Deliv man with gray hair curled tight\nagainst his scalp. He wore a kelly-green Deliv uniform without epaulets or\ninsignia. The man leaned over Tamas, regarding him contemplatively.\n“Good. You’re awake. The doctors were beginning to think you might\nbe out indefinitely. We’re almost to the summit.”\nTamas closed his eyes again. Perhaps his mind was too foggy to hear\ncorrectly. Had the Deliv said “summit”?\n“Who the bloody pit are you?” Tamas asked. The face seemed familiar\nin a long-absent way, like a painting seen above a mantelpiece or a figure\nfrom his childhood. One of Sabon’s relatives? No, he didn’t look a thing\nlike Sabon.\nThe Deliv bowed his head. “I am Deliv.”\n“I said who are you, not where are you from. Bloody fool.” Tamas’s\nbrain pounded inside his skull like a military parade. He flexed his fingers\nand tested his bonds. Wait. He didn’t have any bonds. Then why couldn’t he\nmove? He lifted his head and looked down at the tight-fitting blanket\nwrapped around his chest.\nA little wiggling and Tamas was able to pull his arms free. He pushed\nthe blanket aside and sat up."

He pushed\nthe blanket aside and sat up.\nHe was wearing his spare uniform—at least, he thought it was his spare.\nThis one wasn’t soiled from the battle outside Alvation.\nThe carriage came to a stop suddenly, pitching Tamas to one side. The\nDeliv reached out a hand to steady him. Tamas waved him off.\n“What do you mean, ‘summit’?” he asked.\nThe door to the carriage opened to reveal Olem standing outside. He\nsnapped to attention and his face split into a grin at the sight of Tamas.\n“Sir! Glad to see you awake. How is your head?”\nTamas felt a wave of relief. He was still in the hands of his own men, it\nseemed, and Olem was still armed. He cast a glance toward the Deliv and\nstepped out of the carriage.\n“Feels like I was thrown off the top of Sablethorn and landed on my\nface,” Tamas said.\nHe looked to either side and noted they were in the mountains. Well, that\nexplained “the summit.”\n“Are we past the Alvation Mountainwatch?”\n“We’ve passed the first Mountainwatch post, sir.” Olem pointed up the\npath. “The main Alvation Mountainwatch fortress is up ahead. We’ll spend\nthe night there before resuming the march.”\nTamas felt emotions flow over him like the surf on a windy day. His legs\nwere already weak, and news that he was already on Adran soil nearly made\nhim fall. He pushed away Olem’s offered hand and began to walk up the\npath. He thought through the calculations in his head. This time of year the\npass would be quite clear and likely dry. They could descend back onto the\nAdran plains and head toward Surkov’s Alley. They’d be back defending\nthe country in a week and a half of hard march.\n“Sir, you should continue to rest.”\n“I can walk fine,” Tamas said, though his legs had more than a little\nwobble to them and his head was dizzy. Up ahead, the Alvation\nMountainwatch fortress looked tall and imposing. The doors had been\nthrown open, and Mountainwatchers were cheering at the soldiers marching\nup the pass. “The fresh air will do me good. Now report. How long have I\nbeen out?”\n“Two days, sir.”\n“The battle?”\n“It went…”—Olem hesitated—“well enough.”\n“Our losses?”\nOlem plucked a cigarette from his the curl of his jacket cuff and stuck it\nin his mouth without lighting it. “We have less than two thousand men in\nfighting condition left between the Seventh and the Ninth.”\n“That’s it?” Tamas came to a stop and turned to Olem. He looked back\ndown the path and noted that their baggage train led far beyond his sight.\nWhere had that come from? They’d not had a baggage train in their march\nnorth.\n“Gavril?”\n“Recovered by Demasolin.”\nTamas felt relief wash over him. “My powder mages?”\n“Vidaslav took a bayonet to the stomach. We don’t know if he’ll survive.\nLeone was killed defending Vlora from a Warden.”"

It was several moments before he regained\nhis composure and stepped away.\nHe noticed that the old man from the carriage was following them up the\npath.\n“How are we going to make a dent in the Kez army in Adro with just\ntwo thousand men?” Tamas asked. He couldn’t help the annoyance in his\nvoice when he jerked his head at the old Deliv and said, “And who the pit is\nthis?”\nOlem took his cigarette out of his mouth and twirled it between his\nfingers. “Please excuse the field marshal,” he said to the old Deliv. “He’s\nnot in his right mind.”\nThe Deliv seemed amused by this. “I hope he gets into his right mind\nbefore we go up against the Kez.” He bowed his head. “I am Deliv,” he\nsaid, “but you may call me Sulem the Ninth.”\nSulem the… “Oh. My lord.” Tamas inclined his head, shaking off the\nurge to drop to one knee. His mouth had gone dry. Sulem IX, king of Deliv,\nand Tamas had sworn at him for being a bloody fool in the carriage. “I\nmeant no offense. I didn’t realize…”\n“None taken, Field Marshal.” The king raised an eyebrow and glanced\ntoward the ground as if expecting Tamas to kneel, but did not pursue the\nidea further.\nTamas didn’t know what to say. How much did the king know? Why\nwas he here, marching along with Tamas and a brand-new baggage train?\n“I’m sorry, my lord,” Tamas said, “but I am very much out of touch. I’m\nnot sure what has gone on in the days while I was out.”\nThe king clasped his hands behind his back. “Colonel,” he said to Olem,\n“do you mind if I give your report?”\n“Not at all, Your Eminence.”\n“Shall we?” the king asked, extending his arm toward the fortress rising\nabove them.\n“Yes,” Tamas said.\nThey continued walking up the mountain road, past the remnants of\nTamas’s cavalry, with Olem trailing a few feet behind.\nThe Deliv king said, “Let me tell you how things have come from my\nside, and then later you can finish your conversation with Colonel Olem. I\ncame to Alvation expecting an Adran army, but instead found two. The day\nafter your battle with Duke Nikslaus’s troops was a little confusing, but\nbetween my generals and your Colonel Olem and Colonel Arbor,\neverything got sorted out.” Sulem paused for a moment.\n“I’m sorry for Alvation, my lord,” Tamas said.\n“Sorry? What for? You saved a Deliv city, Tamas. I am greatly in your\ndebt.”\n“The gunpowder?”\n“You and your powder mages stopped it before too much damage could\nbe dealt. There were casualties, of course, but the city remains and with it a\ndebt of gratitude.”\n“I see”—Tamas glanced over his shoulder at the baggage train—“that"

There were casualties, of course, but the city remains and with it a\ndebt of gratitude.”\n“I see”—Tamas glanced over his shoulder at the baggage train—“that\nyou’ve supplied us for our journey. For that, I am grateful.”\nThere was a twinkle in Sulem’s eye, and for the first time since the\ncarriage, a smile crept onto the old king’s face. “Supplies and more,” he\nsaid.\n“More?”\n“Field Marshal,” Sulem said, “this is the vanguard. We’re coming over\nthe mountains with fifty thousand men. There would be more if I hadn’t\nsent the better part of my army down the Great Northern Road into Kez.\nYou have my soldiers at your service, and I intend to see you through this\nwar. The kind of treachery plotted by Nikslaus and Ipille does not befit a\nbrother king.” Sulem’s smile disappeared, his voice gaining a dangerous\nedge. “You may have sent Manhouch to the guillotine, and I do not\napprove, but Ipille made an attack upon my people.”\nFifty thousand Deliv troops! That, Tamas knew, could send the Kez\nreeling. Tamas felt his heart soar. This would turn the tide of the war. Adro\nhad more than just a chance now, they had an ally.\nFor the first time in weeks his step was light. He neared the Alvation\nMountainwatch feeling as if a great weight had been lifted off his shoulders.\nThere was a clamor on the walls of the Mountainwatch fortress, and a\nhorseman suddenly burst through the gate at a reckless speed. The\nmessenger saw Tamas and sawed at the reins, bringing his mount to a stop\nin a spray of gravel. The man leapt from horseback.\n“Sir,” he said. His cheeks were red, frost-burned from navigating the\ncold heights at great speeds, and his hand trembled as he saluted.\n“Breathe, soldier,” Tamas said.\n“Sir,” the messenger gasped, “we have word from one of our posts on\nthe eastern side of the mountains. Adopest, sir. It’s burning.”\nEPILOGUE\nP\nrivileged Borbador stood on the front step of a medium-sized house in the\nAdran suburbs and wondered when the last time was that he’d asked\nsomeone for help. It wasn’t something most Privileged were accustomed to\ndoing. They either did everything themselves or they gave orders.\nAn explosion rocked the evening air, causing Bo to flinch. Another\nchurch. Those Brudanian bastards had been demolishing religious buildings\nall over the city. They’d dragged priests out into the street and beat them to\ndeath in public, and the Adran people had just stood by and watched it all\nhappen. They were too shell-shocked by the war, too relieved that the\nBrudanians hadn’t sacked the city, to do anything to stop it.\nSome had even joined in.\nBo didn’t like the Kresim Church very much, but he hated the idea of\nstanding by and watching while a foreign army destroyed the cultural icons\nof the city. He’d been in the crowd, watching while they tore down the\nKresim Cathedral. He’d listened to Claremonte’s speech and seen the\nTrading Company army come onshore, unopposed by people who should"

        "text": "Kresim Cathedral. He’d listened to Claremonte’s speech and seen the\nTrading Company army come onshore, unopposed by people who should\nhave been defending their city.\nIt made Bo nervous for the Trading Company Privileged to be in the\ncity. He’d spent every day since their arrival going to great lengths to avoid\nthem. At best, they’d try to press him into service, thinking he had no\nallegiances left to Adro. At worse, they’d see him as a loose end and do\ntheir best to kill him.\nBo might have thrown his all at them the day they arrived, sinking\nseveral of the ships—maybe even killing Claremonte—before being put\ndown by the Brudanian Privileged. But he was finished with other people’s\ncrusades. He had his own problems to worry about now.\nA friend and brother to save.\nThe sound of children’s laughter reached him from inside the house. It\nalmost made him pause. Almost.\nBo rapped on the door. The laughter stopped.\n“Stay here, children,” a nervous voice commanded. Floorboards creaked\nas someone came down the front hall of the house. Bo’s third eye told him it\nwas the very Knacked he was coming to see. He could sense someone\npeering through the eyehole at him, and then a deadbolt was turned. The\ndoor opened a crack.\n“Privileged Borbador,” Adamat said.\nBo bowed his head. “Inspector Adamat.”\nAdamat’s eyes searched the street, slightly wild, as if looking for a trap.\n“To what do I owe the pleasure? I didn’t think I’d ever see you again.”\n“I brought gifts,” Bo said, indicating the paper-wrapped packages\nbeneath his arms. “May I come in?”\nAdamat scanned the street once more. Conflict raged across his face. He\nwas a nervous man these days, it seemed. Bo could relate.\nAnd nobody wanted to invite a Privileged into their home.\n“Love,” a woman’s voice came, “who is it?”\n“Privileged Borbador.”\nThe door opened the rest of the way and Bo saw Faye standing in the\nhallway. She looked somewhat better than that day in Vetas’s manor. She’d\ngotten some sleep, and though Bo guessed from the red in the corner of her\neyes that she’d been crying recently, she hid it well.\n“Privileged,” Faye said, “please come in.”\nBo brought his bundle of packages inside with him and deposited them\nin the living room. “Call me Bo,” he said. “I brought gifts for your family.”\n“You shouldn’t have,” Faye said, giving him a gracious smile.\nAdamat looked less pleased with the idea. There was a wariness in his\neyes. He didn’t trust Bo.\nBo couldn’t exactly blame him for that.\n“Did you feel it?” Bo asked.\nAdamat seemed taken aback. “Feel what?”\n“It would have been an unexplained shock,” Bo said. “Like being alone\nin a room and a cold glass of water thrown in your face.”\nAdamat slowly shook his head. “I don’t know what you mean.”\nStrange, Bo thought, that Knacked couldn’t sense it when a god died.\nMihali—Adom reborn—had been murdered six days ago.

It wasn’t the\nsame as when Taniel had shot Kresimir in the eye, though. This had felt\nmore… permanent.\n“Nothing,” Bo said. “No need to worry yourselves over it.”\n“We were just having dinner,” Faye said, giving her husband a warning\nlook. “Would you join us?”\n“Thank you, but no. I was hoping to talk to your husband alone.”\nAdamat cleared his throat. “Faye can hear anything I would,” he said.\nBo could tell at a glance that Faye wasn’t going to leave the room. So\nmuch for divide and conquer. He wondered if he should have brought Nila\nand Jakob inside with him. Bo had asked them to wait in the carriage, but\nnow he thought their presence might have helped put Adamat at ease.\nHe still wasn’t sure what he was going to do with that girl. She was a\nPrivileged, it seemed. A Privileged who didn’t need gloves. Bo didn’t think\nthat she understood the gravity of what she really was. No Privileged in all\nthe Nine could touch the Else without gloves. Not even the Predeii.\nOnly the so-called gods could do that.\n“I need your help,” Bo said.\n“I’m not for hire,” Adamat said, glancing at his wife. “My family has\ngone through greater trials the last few months than any family ought. I will\nnot leave them for anything.”\nFaye narrowed her eyes at Bo, her gracious welcome suddenly gone. To\nBo it felt as if the warmth had been sucked out of the room.\n“Two things,” Bo said, holding up his hands. He’d left his gloves off for\nthis. The last thing he needed was for Adamat to think he was trying to\nthreaten him. “First, I need you, Faye, to watch over Jakob Eldaminse for a\ntime.”\n“The boy’s alive?” Faye asked.\n“Second,” Bo added, “I need Adamat to help me rescue my best friend\n—my only friend. I have evidence that condemns General Ket and her sister\nof selling army property for their own profit. I need you, Sergeant Oldrich,\nand Oldrich’s men to come with me to arrest General Ket and get Taniel\nTwo-Shot released.”\nThis whole thing made Bo nervous. He’d not heard a word from the\nfront since finding out that Taniel was being court-martialed. Taniel could\nbe in prison, he could have been hanged. Bo cursed himself for not acting\nfast enough on this, but he’d had to find evidence before he could do\nanything about it. He should have left for the front as soon as he’d found\nevidence of Ket’s involvement a week ago, but he’d had to gather more\nevidence than just one dead noble’s records.\n“Arresting a member of the General Staff during wartime?” Adamat\nscoffed. “That’s suicide. No. I won’t do it. As I said, I have a family to care\nfor and protect. I am not for hire.”\n“Please,” Faye said, her jaw stiff, “we’d like to get back to dinner with\nour children now.”\nBo ignored them. He hated himself, sometimes, for the things he had to"

For the killing, the lying and stealing. For having to manipulate people.\n“In exchange for your help, Adamat, I will give you one favor from\nmyself.”\n“What could I possibly…”\n“One favor!” Bo said, holding up a finger. “Anything you want from the\nlast living member of the Adran royal cabal.”\nFaye frowned. Bo could see her mind working behind her eyes.\n“No,” Adamat said. “I don’t think—”\n“Love,” Faye said, tugging on Adamat’s arm.\nBo took a deep breath. “One favor,” he said again. “Anything you want.\nEven if it means I have to slaughter my way through Kez to find your\nmissing son.”\nThere would be protestations. Arguments. They would try several more\nexcuses, but Bo could see in their eyes that he had them.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThanks to my fantastic agent, Caitlin Blasdell, for her editorial advice and\nher willingness to talk it out when I was having problems with the book—\nand of course for selling the book in the first place.
