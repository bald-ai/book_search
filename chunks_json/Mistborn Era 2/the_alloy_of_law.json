        "text": "FOR JOSHUA BILMES\nWho is never afraid to tell me what is wrong with a book, then fight for\nthat same book no matter who else gives up on it.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI first pitched the idea of later-era Mistborn novels to my editor back in\n2006, I believe. It had long been my plan for Scadrial, the planet these\nbooks take place upon. I wanted to move away from the idea of fantasy\nworlds as static places, where millennia would pass and technology would\nnever change. The plan then was for a second epic trilogy set in an urban\nera, and a third trilogy set in a futuristic era—with Allomancy, Feruchemy,\nand Hemalurgy being the common threads that tied them together.\nThis book isn’t part of that second trilogy. It’s a side deviation, something\nexciting that grew quite unexpectedly out of my planning for where the\nworld would go. The point of telling you all of this, however, is to explain\nthat it would be impossible to list all of the people who have helped me\nalong the years. Instead, the best I can do is list some of the wonderful\npeople who helped me with this specific book.\nAlpha readers included, as always, my agent, Joshua Bilmes, and my\neditor, Moshe Feder. This book is dedicated to Joshua, actually.\nProfessionally, he’s believed in my work longer than anyone outside my\nwriting group. He has been a wonderful resource and a good friend.\nOther alphas were my writing group: Ethan Skarstedt, Dan Wells, Alan &\nJeanette Layton, Kaylynn ZoBell, Karen Ahlstrom, Ben & Danielle Olsen,\nJordan Sanderson (kind of), and Kathleen Dorsey. Finally, of course, there’s\nthe Inseparable Peter Ahlstrom, my assistant and friend, who does all kinds\nof important things for my writing and doesn’t get nearly enough thanks for\nit.\nAt Tor Books, thanks go to Irene Gallo, Justin Golenbock, Terry\nMcGarry, and many others I couldn’t possibly name—everyone from Tom\nDoherty to the sales force. Thank you all for your excellent work. Once\nagain, I feel the need to give a special thanks to Paul Stevens, who goes\nabove and beyond what I could reasonably expect to give aid and\nexplanations.\nBeta readers included Jeff Creer and Dominique Nolan. A special thanks\nto Dom for being a resource in regards to weaponry and guns. If you ever\nneed anything shot properly, he’s the one to call.\nNote the lovely cover by Chris McGrath, whom I asked for specifically\nbecause of his work on the Mistborn paperback covers. Both Ben\nMcSweeney and Isaac Stewart returned to provide interior art for this book,\nas their work on The Way of Kings was just plain awesome. They’ve\ncontinued in their awesomeness. Ben also provided equally awesome\nillustrations for the recently released Mistborn RPG from Crafty Games.\nCheck it out at crafty-games.com, especially if you’re interested in Kelsier’s\norigin story.\nLast of all I’d like to once again thank Emily, my wonderful wife, for her\nsupport, commentary, and love.\nCONTENTS\nTitle Page\nDedication\nAcknowledgments\nMaps\nPrologue\nChapter 1\nChapter 2\nChapter 3\nChapter 4\nChapter 5\nChapter 6\nChapter 7\nChapter 8"

He held his Sterrion 36 up by his head, the long, silvery barrel\ndusted with red clay. The revolver was nothing fancy to look at, though the\nsix-shot cylinder was machined with such care in the steel-alloy frame that\nthere was no play in its movement. There was no gleam to the metal or\nexotic material on the grip. But it fit his hand like it was meant to be there.\nThe waist-high fence was flimsy, the wood grayed with time, held\ntogether with fraying lengths of rope. It smelled of age. Even the worms\nhad given up on this wood long ago.\nWax peeked up over the knotted boards, scanning the empty town. Blue\nlines hovered in his vision, extending from his chest to point at nearby\nsources of metal, a result of his Allomancy. Burning steel did that; it let him\nsee the location of sources of metal, then Push against them if he wanted.\nHis weight against the weight of the item. If it was heavier, he was pushed\nback. If he was heavier, it was pushed forward.\nIn this case, however, he didn’t Push. He just watched the lines to see if\nany of the metal was moving. None of it was. Nails holding together\nbuildings, spent shell casings lying scattered in the dust, or horseshoes piled\nat the silent smithy—all were as motionless as the old hand pump planted in\nthe ground to his right.\nWary, he too remained still. Steel continued to burn comfortably in his\nstomach, and so—as a precaution—he gently Pushed outward from himself\nin all directions. It was a trick he’d mastered a few years back; he didn’t\nPush on any specific metal objects, but created a kind of defensive bubble\naround himself. Any metal that came streaking in his direction would be\nthrown slightly off course.\nIt was far from foolproof; he could still get hit. But shots would go wild,\nnot striking where they were aimed. It had saved his life on a couple of\noccasions. He wasn’t even certain how he did it; Allomancy was often an\ninstinctive thing for him. Somehow he even managed to exempt the metal\nhe carried, and didn’t Push his own gun from his hands.\nThat done, he continued along the fence—still watching the metal lines\nto make sure nobody was sneaking up on him. Feltrel had once been a\nprosperous town. That had been twenty years back. Then a clan of koloss\nhad taken up residence nearby. Things hadn’t gone well.\nToday, the dead town seemed completely empty, though he knew it\nwasn’t so. Wax had come here hunting a psychopath. And he wasn’t the\nonly one."

        "text": "Today, the dead town seemed completely empty, though he knew it\nwasn’t so. Wax had come here hunting a psychopath. And he wasn’t the\nonly one.\nHe grabbed the top of the fence and hopped over, feet grinding red clay.\nCrouching low, he ran in a squat over to the side of the old blacksmith’s\nforge. His clothing was terribly dusty, but well tailored: a fine suit, a silver\ncravat at the neck, twinkling cuff links on the sleeves of his fine white shirt.\nHe had cultivated a look that appeared out of place, as if he were planning\nto attend a fine ball back in Elendel rather than scrambling through a dead\ntown in the Roughs hunting a murderer. Completing the ensemble, he wore\na bowler hat on his head to keep off the sun.\nA sound; someone stepped on a board across the street, making it creak.\nIt was so faint, he almost missed it. Wax reacted immediately, flaring the\nsteel that burned inside his stomach. He Pushed on a group of nails in the\nwall beside him just as the crack of a gunshot split the air.\nHis sudden Push caused the wall to rattle, the old rusty nails straining in\ntheir places. His Push shoved him to the side, and he rolled across the\nground. A blue line appeared for an eyeblink—the bullet, which hit the\nground where he had been a moment before. As he came up from his roll, a\nsecond shot followed. This one came close, but bent just a hair out of the\nway as it neared him.\nDeflected by his steel bubble, the bullet zipped past his ear. Another inch\nto the right, and he’d have gotten it in the forehead—steel bubble or no.\nBreathing calmly, he raised his Sterrion and sighted on the balcony of the\nold hotel across the street, where the shot had come from. The balcony was\nfronted by the hotel’s sign, capable of hiding a gunman.\nWax fired, then Pushed on the bullet, slamming it forward with extra\nthrust to make it faster and more penetrating. He wasn’t using typical lead\nor copper-jacketed lead bullets; he needed something stronger.\nThe large-caliber steel-jacketed bullet hit the balcony, and his extra\npower caused it to puncture the wood and hit the man behind. The blue line\nleading to the man’s gun quivered as he fell. Wax stood up slowly, brushing\nthe dust from his clothing. At that moment another shot cracked in the air.\nHe cursed, reflexively Pushing against the nails again, though his\ninstincts told him he’d be too late. By the time he heard a shot, it was too\nlate for Pushing to help.\nThis time he was thrown to the ground. That force had to go somewhere,\nand if the nails couldn’t move, he had to. He grunted as he hit and raised his\nrevolver, dust sticking to the sweat on his hand. He searched frantically for\nthe one who’d fired at him. They’d missed. Perhaps the steel bubble had—\nA body rolled off the top of the blacksmith’s shop and thumped down to\nthe ground with a puff of red dust. Wax blinked, then raised his gun to chest\nlevel and moved over behind the fence again, crouching down for cover. He"

        "text": "the ground with a puff of red dust. Wax blinked, then raised his gun to chest\nlevel and moved over behind the fence again, crouching down for cover. He\nkept an eye on the blue Allomantic lines. They could warn him if someone\ngot close, but only if the person was carrying or wearing metal.\nThe body that had fallen beside the building didn’t have a single line\npointing to it. However, another set of quivering lines pointed to something\nmoving along the back of the forge. Wax leveled his gun, taking aim as a\nfigure ducked around the side of the building and ran toward him.\nThe woman wore a white duster, reddened at the bottom. She kept her\ndark hair pulled back in a tail, and wore trousers and a wide belt, with thick\nboots on her feet. She had a squarish face. A strong face, with lips that often\nrose slightly at the right side in a half smile.\nWax heaved a sigh of relief and lowered his gun. “Lessie.”\n“You knock yourself to the ground again?” she asked as she reached the\ncover of the fence beside him. “You’ve got more dust on your face than\nMiles has scowls. Maybe it’s time for you to retire, old man.”\n“Lessie, I’m three months older than you are.”\n“Those are a long three months.” She peeked up over the fence. “Seen\nanyone else?”\n“I dropped a man up on the balcony,” Wax said. “I couldn’t see if it was\nBloody Tan or not.”\n“It wasn’t,” she said. “He wouldn’t have tried to shoot you from so far\naway.”\nWax nodded. Tan liked things personal. Up close. The psychopath\nlamented when he had to use a gun, and he rarely shot someone without\nbeing able to see the fear in their eyes.\nLessie scanned the quiet town, then glanced at him, ready to move. Her\neyes flickered downward for a moment. Toward his shirt pocket.\nWax followed her gaze. A letter was peeking out of his pocket, delivered\nearlier that day. It was from the grand city of Elendel, and was addressed to\nLord Waxillium Ladrian. A name Wax hadn’t used in years. A name that felt\nwrong to him now.\nHe tucked the letter farther into his pocket. Lessie thought it implied\nmore than it did. The city didn’t hold anything for him now, and House\nLadrian would get along without him. He really should have burned that\nletter.\nWax nodded toward the fallen man beside the wall to distract her from\nthe letter. “Your work?”\n“He had a bow,” she said. “Stone arrowheads. Almost had you from\nabove.”\n“Thanks.”\nShe shrugged, eyes glittering in satisfaction. Those eyes now had lines at\nthe sides of them, weathered by the Roughs’ harsh sunlight. There had been\na time when she and Wax had kept a tally of who had saved the other most\noften. They’d both lost track years ago.\n“Cover me,” Wax said softly.\n“With what?” she asked. “Paint? Kisses? You’re already covered with\ndust.”\nWax raised an eyebrow at her.\n“Sorry,” she said, grimacing. “I’ve been playing cards too much with\nWayne lately.”"

The\nman had been a cruel-faced fellow with several days of stubble on his\ncheeks; the bullet wound bled out his right side. I think I recognize him,\nWax thought to himself as he went through the man’s pockets and came out\nwith a drop of red glass, colored like blood.\nHe hurried back to the fence.\n“Well?” Lessie asked.\n“Donal’s crew,” Wax said, holding up the drop of glass.\n“Bastards,” Lessie said. “They couldn’t just leave us to it, could they?”\n“You did shoot his son, Lessie.”\n“And you shot his brother.”\n“Mine was self-defense.”\n“Mine was too,” she said. “That kid was annoying. Besides, he\nsurvived.”\n“Missing a toe.”\n“You don’t need ten,” she said. “I have a cousin with four. She does just\nfine.” She raised her revolver, scanning the empty town. “Of course, she\ndoes look kind of ridiculous. Cover me.”\n“With what?”\nShe just grinned and ducked out from behind the cover, scrambling\nacross the ground toward the smithy.\nHarmony, Wax thought with a smile, I love that woman.\nHe watched for more gunmen, but Lessie reached the building without\nany further shots being fired. Wax nodded to her, then dashed across the\nstreet toward the hotel. He ducked inside, checking the corners for foes. The\ntaproom was empty, so he took cover beside the doorway, waving toward\nLessie. She ran down to the next building on her side of the street and\nchecked it out.\nDonal’s crew. Yes, Wax had shot his brother—the man had been robbing\na railway car at the time. From what he understood, though, Donal hadn’t\never cared for his brother. No, the only thing that riled Donal was losing\nmoney, which was probably why he was here. He’d put a price on Bloody\nTan’s head for stealing a shipment of his bendalloy. Donal probably hadn’t\nexpected Wax to come hunting Tan the same day he did, but his men had\nstanding orders to shoot Wax or Lessie if seen.\nWax was half tempted to leave the dead town and let Donal and Tan have\nat it. The thought of it made his eye twitch, though. He’d promised to bring\nTan in. That was that.\nLessie waved from the inside of her building, then pointed toward the\nback. She was going to go out in that direction and creep along behind the\nnext set of buildings. Wax nodded, then made a curt gesture. He’d try to\nhook up with Wayne and Barl, who had gone to check the other side of the\ntown.\nLessie vanished, and Wax picked his way through the old hotel toward a\nside door. He passed old, dirty nests made by both rats and men. The town\npicked up miscreants the way a dog picked up fleas. He even passed a place\nwhere it looked like some wayfarer had made a small firepit on a sheet of\nmetal with a ring of rocks. It was a wonder the fool hadn’t burned the entire"

        "text": "where it looked like some wayfarer had made a small firepit on a sheet of\nmetal with a ring of rocks. It was a wonder the fool hadn’t burned the entire\nbuilding to the ground.\nWax eased open the side door and stepped into an alleyway between the\nhotel and the store beside it. The gunshots earlier would have been heard,\nand someone might come looking. Best to stay out of sight.\nWax edged around the back of the store, stepping quietly across the red\nclay ground. The hillside here was overgrown with weeds except for the\nentrance to an old cold cellar. Wax wound around it, then paused, eyeing the\nwood-framed pit.\nMaybe …\nHe knelt beside the opening, peering down. There had been a ladder here\nonce, but it had rotted away—the remnants were visible below in a pile of\nold splinters. The air smelled musty and wet … with a hint of smoke.\nSomeone had been burning a torch down there.\nWax dropped a bullet into the hole, then leaped in, gun out. As he fell, he\nfilled his iron metalmind, decreasing his weight. He was Twinborn—a\nFeruchemist as well as an Allomancer. His Allomantic power was\nSteelpushing, and his Feruchemical power, called Skimming, was the\nability to grow heavier or lighter. It was a powerful combination of talents.\nHe Pushed against the round below him, slowing his fall so that he\nlanded softly. He returned his weight to normal—or, well, normal for him.\nHe often went about at three-quarters of his unadjusted weight, making\nhimself lighter on his feet, quicker to react.\nHe crept through the darkness. It had been a long, difficult road, finding\nwhere Bloody Tan was hiding. In the end, the fact that Feltrel had suddenly\nemptied of other bandits, wanderers, and unfortunates had been a major\nclue. Wax stepped softly, working his way deeper into the cellar. The scent\nof smoke was stronger here, and though the light was fading, he made out a\nfirepit beside the earthen wall. That and a ladder that could be moved into\nplace at the entrance.\nThat gave him pause. It indicated that whoever was making their hideout\nin the cellar—it could be Tan, or it could be someone else entirely—was\nstill down here. Unless there was another way out. Wax crept forward a\nlittle farther, squinting in the dark.\nThere was light ahead.\nWax cocked his gun softly, then drew a little vial out of his mistcoat and\npulled the cork with his teeth. He downed the whiskey and steel in one shot,\nrestoring his reserves. He flared his steel. Yes … there was metal ahead of\nhim, down the tunnel. How long was this cellar? He had assumed it would\nbe small, but the reinforcing wood timbers indicated something deeper,\nlonger. More like a mine adit.\nHe crept forward, focused on those metal lines. Someone would have to\naim a gun if they saw him, and the metal would quiver, giving him a chance\nto Push the weapon out of their hands. Nothing moved.

He approached a\ntrembling light, but could hear nothing. The metal lines did not move.\nFinally, he got close enough to make out a lamp hanging by a hook on a\nwooden beam near the wall. Something else hung at the center of the\ntunnel. A body? Hanged? Wax cursed softly and hurried forward, wary of a\ntrap. It was a corpse, but it left him baffled. At first glance, it seemed years\nold. The eyes were gone from the skull, the skin pulled back against the\nbone. It didn’t stink, and wasn’t bloated.\nHe thought he recognized it. Geormin, the coachman who brought mail\ninto Weathering from the more distant villages around the area. That was\nhis uniform, at least, and it seemed like his hair. He’d been one of Tan’s first\nvictims, the disappearance that sent Wax hunting. That had only been two\nmonths back.\nHe’s been mummified, Wax thought. Prepared and dried like leather. He\nfelt revolted—he’d gone drinking with Geormin on occasion, and though\nthe man cheated at cards, he’d been an amiable enough fellow.\nThe hanging wasn’t an ordinary one, either. Wires had been used to prop\nup Geormin’s arms so they were out to the sides, his head cocked, his\nmouth pried open. Wax turned away from the gruesome sight, his eye\ntwitching.\nCareful, he told himself. Don’t let him anger you. Keep focused. He\nwould be back to cut Geormin down. Right now, he couldn’t afford to make\nthe noise. At least he knew he was on the right track. This was certainly\nBloody Tan’s lair.\nThere was another patch of light in the distance. How long was this\ntunnel? He approached the pool of light, and here found another corpse, this\none hung on the wall sideways. Annarel, a visiting geologist who had\nvanished soon after Geormin. Poor woman. She’d been dried in the same\nmanner, body spiked to the wall in a very specific pose, as if she were on\nher knees inspecting a pile of rocks.\nAnother pool of light drew him onward. Clearly this wasn’t a cellar—it\nwas probably some kind of smuggling tunnel left over from the days when\nFeltrel had been a booming town. Tan hadn’t built this, not with those aged\nwooden supports.\nWax passed another six corpses, each lit by its own glowing lantern, each\narranged in some kind of pose. One sat in a chair, another strung up as if\nflying, a few stuck to the wall. The later ones were more fresh, the last one\nrecently killed. Wax didn’t recognize the slender man, who hung with hand\nto his head in a salute.\nRust and Ruin, Wax thought. This isn’t Bloody Tan’s lair … it’s his\ngallery.\nSickened, Wax made his way to the next pool of light. This one was\ndifferent. Brighter. As he approached, he realized that he was seeing\nsunlight streaming down from a square cut in the ceiling. The tunnel led up\nto it, probably to a former trapdoor that had rotted or broken away.

The\nground sloped in a gradual slant up to the hole.\nWax crawled up the slope, then cautiously poked his head out. He’d\ncome up in a building, though the roof was gone. The brick walls were\nmostly intact, and there were four altars in the front, just to Wax’s left. An\nold chapel to the Survivor. It seemed empty.\nWax crawled out of the hole, his Sterrion at the side of his head, coat\nmarred by dirt from below. The clean, dry air smelled good to him.\n“Each life is a performance,” a voice said, echoing in the ruined church.\nWax immediately ducked to the side, rolling up to an altar.\n“But we are not the performers,” the voice continued. “We are the\npuppets.”\n“Tan,” Wax said. “Come out.”\n“I have seen God, lawkeeper,” Tan whispered. Where was he? “I have\nseen Death himself, with the nails in his eyes. I have seen the Survivor, who\nis life.”\nWax scanned the small chapel. It was cluttered with broken benches and\nfallen statues. He rounded the side of the altar, judging the sound to come\nfrom the back of the room.\n“Other men wonder,” Tan’s voice said, “but I know. I know I’m a puppet.\nWe all are. Did you like my show? I worked so hard to build it.”\nWax continued along the building’s right wall, his boots leaving a trail in\nthe dust. He breathed shallowly, a line of sweat creeping down his right\ntemple. His eye was twitching. He saw corpses on the walls in his mind’s\neye.\n“Many men never get a chance to create true art,” Tan said. “And the best\nperformances are those which can never be reproduced. Months, years,\nspent preparing. Everything placed right. But at the end of the day, the\nrotting will begin. I couldn’t truly mummify them; I hadn’t the time or\nresources. I could only preserve them long enough to prepare for this one\nshow. Tomorrow, it will be ruined. You were the only one to see it. Only\nyou. I figure … we’re all just puppets … you see…”\nThe voice was coming from the back of the room, near some rubble that\nwas blocking Wax’s view.\n“Someone else moves us,” Tan said.\nWax ducked around the side of the rubble, raising his Sterrion.\nTan stood there, holding Lessie in front of him, her mouth gagged, her\neyes wide. Wax froze in place, gun raised. Lessie was bleeding from her leg\nand her arm. She’d been shot, and her face was growing pale. She’d lost\nblood. That was how Tan had been able to overpower her.\nWax grew still. He didn’t feel anxiety. He couldn’t afford to; it might\nmake him shake, and shaking might make him miss. He could see Tan’s\nface behind Lessie; the man held a garrote around her neck.\nTan was a slender, fine-fingered man. He’d been a mortician. Black hair,\nthinning, worn greased back. A nice suit that now shone with blood."

A nice suit that now shone with blood.\n“Someone else moves us, lawman,” Tan said softly.\nLessie met Wax’s eyes. They both knew what to do in this situation. Last\ntime, he’d been the one captured. People always tried to use them against\neach other. In Lessie’s opinion, that wasn’t a disadvantage. She’d have\nexplained that if Tan hadn’t known the two of them were a couple, he’d\nhave killed her right off. Instead, he’d kidnapped her. That gave them a\nchance to get out.\nWax sighted down the barrel of his Sterrion. He drew in the trigger until\nhe balanced the weight of the sear right on the edge of firing, and Lessie\nblinked. One. Two. Three.\nWax fired.\nIn the same instant, Tan yanked Lessie to the right.\nThe shot broke the air, echoing against clay bricks. Lessie’s head jerked\nback as Wax’s bullet took her just above the right eye. Blood sprayed\nagainst the clay wall beside her. She crumpled.\nWax stood, frozen, horrified. No … that isn’t the way … it can’t …\n“The best performances,” Tan said, smiling and looking down at Lessie’s\nfigure, “are those that can only be performed once.”\nWax shot him in the head.\n1\nFive months later, Wax walked through the decorated rooms of a large,\nlively party, passing men in dark suits with tailcoats and women in colorful\ndresses with narrow waists and lots of folds through long pleated skirts.\nThey called him “Lord Waxillium” or “Lord Ladrian” when they spoke to\nhim.\nHe nodded to each, but avoided being drawn into conversation. He\ndeliberately made his way to one of the back rooms of the party, where\ndazzling electric lights—the talk of the city—produced a steady, too-even\nlight to ward off the evening’s gloom. Outside the windows, he could see\nmist tickling the glass.\nDefying decorum, Wax pushed his way through the room’s enormous\nglass double doors and stepped out onto the mansion’s grand balcony.\nThere, finally, he felt like he could breathe again.\nHe closed his eyes, taking the air in and out, feeling the faint wetness of\nthe mists on the skin of his face. Buildings are so … suffocating here in the\ncity, he thought. Have I simply forgotten about that, or did I not notice it\nwhen I was younger?\nHe opened his eyes, and rested his hands on the balcony railing to look\nout over Elendel. It was the grandest city in all the world, a metropolis\ndesigned by Harmony himself. The place of Wax’s youth. A place that\nhadn’t been his home for twenty years.\nThough it had been five months since Lessie’s death, he could still hear\nthe gunshot, see the blood sprayed on the bricks. He had left the Roughs,\nmoved back to the city, answering the desperate summons to do his duty to\nhis house at his uncle’s passing.\nFive months and a world away, and he could still hear that gunshot.\nCrisp, clean, like the sky cracking."

Cett Mansion was a grand place, full of expensive woods, soft\ncarpets, and sparkling chandeliers. No one joined him on the balcony.\nFrom this vantage, he had a perfect view of the lights down Demoux\nPromenade. A double row of bright electric lamps with a steady, blazing\nwhiteness. They glowed like bubbles along the wide boulevard, which was\nflanked by the even wider canal, the still and quiet waters reflecting the\nlight. An evening railway engine called a greeting as it chugged through the\ndistant center of the city, hemming the mists with darker smoke.\nDown Demoux Promenade, Wax had a good view of both the Ironspine\nBuilding and Tekiel Tower, one on either side of the canal.

Out in the Roughs, Cett Mansion—which was\nthree stories high—would have been as tall as a building got. Here, it felt\ndwarfed. The world had gone and changed on him during his years out of\nthe city. It had grown up, inventing lights that needed no fire to glow and\nbuildings that threatened to rise higher than the mists themselves. Looking\ndown that wide street at the edge of the Fifth Octant, Wax suddenly felt\nvery, very old.\n“Lord Waxillium?” a voice asked from behind.\nHe turned to find an older woman, Lady Aving Cett, peeking out the door\nat him. Her gray hair was up in a bun and she wore rubies at her neck. “By\nHarmony, my good man. You’ll take a chill out here! Come, there are some\npeople you will wish to meet.”\n“I’ll be along presently, my lady,” Wax said. “I’m just getting a little air.”\nLady Cett frowned, but retreated. She didn’t know what to make of him;\nnone of them did. Some saw him as a mysterious scion of the Ladrian\nfamily, associated with strange stories of the realms beyond the mountains.\nThe rest assumed him to be an uncultured, rural buffoon. He figured he was\nprobably both.\nHe’d been on show all night. He was supposed to be looking for a wife,\nand pretty much everyone knew it. House Ladrian was insolvent following\nhis uncle’s imprudent management, and the easiest path to solvency was\nmarriage. Unfortunately, his uncle had also managed to offend three-\nquarters of the city’s upper crust.\nWax leaned forward on the balcony, the Sterrion revolvers under his arms\njabbing his sides. With their long barrels, they weren’t meant to be carried\nin underarm holsters. They had been awkward all night."

They had been awkward all night.\nHe should be getting back to the party to chat and try to repair House\nLadrian’s reputation. But the thought of that crowded room, so hot, so\nclose, sweltering, making it difficult to breathe.…\nGiving himself no time to reconsider, he swung off over the side of the\nbalcony and began falling three stories toward the ground. He burned steel,\nthen dropped a spent bullet casing slightly behind himself and Pushed\nagainst it; his weight sent it speeding down to the earth faster than he fell.\nAs always, thanks to his Feruchemy, he was lighter than he should have\nbeen. He hardly knew anymore what it felt like to go around at his full\nweight.\nWhen the casing hit the ground, he Pushed against it and sent himself\nhorizontally in a leap over the garden wall. With one hand on its stone top,\nhe vaulted out of the garden, then reduced his weight to a fraction of normal\nas he fell down the other side. He landed softly.\nAh, good, he thought, crouching down and peering through the mists. The\ncoachmen’s yard. The vehicles everyone had used to get there were\narranged here in neat rows, the coachmen themselves chatting in a few cozy\nrooms that spilled orange light into the mists. No electric lights here; just\ngood, warmth-giving hearths.\nHe walked among the carriages until he found his own, then opened the\ntrunk strapped to the back.\nOff came his gentleman’s fine dinner coat. Instead he threw on his\nmistcoat, a long, enveloping garment like a duster with a thick collar and\ncuffed sleeves. He slipped a shotgun into its pocket on the inside, then\nbuckled on his gun belt and moved the Sterrions into the holsters at his hips.\nAh, he thought. Much better. He really needed to stop carrying the\nSterrions and get some more practical weapons for concealment.\nUnfortunately, he’d never found anything as good as Ranette’s work.\nHadn’t she moved to the city, though? Perhaps he could look her up and\ntalk her into making him something. Assuming she didn’t shoot him on\nsight.\nA few moments later, he was running through the city, the mistcoat light\nupon his back. He left it open at the front, revealing his black shirt and\ngentleman’s trousers. The ankle-length mistcoat had been divided into strips\nfrom just above the waist, the tassels streaming behind him with a faint\nrustle.\nHe dropped a bullet casing and launched himself high into the air,\nlanding atop the building across the street from the mansion. He glanced\nback at it, the windows ablaze in the evening dark. What kind of rumors\nwas he going to start, vanishing from the balcony like that?\nWell, they already knew he was Twinborn—that was a matter of public\nrecord. His disappearance wasn’t going to do much to help patch his\nfamily’s reputation. For the moment, he didn’t care. He’d spent almost\nevery evening since his return to the city at one social function or another,\nand they hadn’t had a misty night in weeks."

He’d spent almost\nevery evening since his return to the city at one social function or another,\nand they hadn’t had a misty night in weeks.\nHe needed the mists. This was who he was.\nWax dashed across the rooftop and leaped off, moving toward Demoux\nPromenade. Just before hitting the ground, he flipped a spent casing down\nand Pushed on it, slowing his descent. He landed in a patch of decorative\nshrubs that caught his coat tassels and made a rustling noise.\nDamn. Nobody planted decorative shrubs out in the Roughs. He pulled\nhimself free, wincing at the noise. A few weeks in the city, and he was\nalready getting rusty?\nHe shook his head and Pushed himself into the air again, moving out\nover the wide boulevard and parallel canal. He angled his flight so he\ncrested that and landed on one of the new electric lamps. There was one\nnice thing about a modern city like this; it had a lot of metal.\nHe smiled, then flared his steel and Pushed off the top of the streetlamp,\nsending himself in a wide arc through the air. Mist streamed past him,\nswirling as the wind rushed against his face. It was thrilling. A man never\ntruly felt free until he’d thrown off gravity’s chains and sought the sky.\nAs he crested his arc, he Pushed against another streetlight, throwing\nhimself farther forward. The long row of metal poles was like his own\npersonal railway line. He bounded onward, his antics drawing attention\nfrom those in passing carriages, both horse-drawn and horseless.\nHe smiled. Coinshots like himself were relatively rare, but Elendel was a\nmajor city with an enormous population. He wouldn’t be the first man these\npeople had seen bounding by metal through the city. Coinshots often acted\nas high-speed couriers in Elendel.\nThe city’s size still astonished him. Millions lived here, maybe as many\nas five million. Nobody had a sure count across all of its wards—they were\ncalled octants, and as one might expect, there were eight of them.\nMillions; he couldn’t picture that, though he’d grown up here. Before\nhe’d left Weathering, he’d been starting to think it was getting too big, but\nthere couldn’t have been ten thousand people in the town.\nHe landed atop a lamp directly in front of the massive Ironspine\nBuilding. He craned his neck, looking up through the mists at the towering\nstructure. The unfinished top was lost in the darkness. Could he climb\nsomething so high? He couldn’t Pull on metals, only Push—he wasn’t some\nmythological Mistborn from the old stories, like the Survivor or the\nAscendant Warrior. One Allomantic power, one Feruchemical power, that\nwas all a man could have. In fact, having just one was a rare privilege—\nbeing Twinborn like Wax was truly exceptional.\nWayne claimed to have memorized the names of all of the different\npossible combinations of Twinborn. Of course, Wayne also claimed to have\nonce stolen a horse that belched in perfect musical notes, so one learned to\ntake what he said with a pinch of copper. Wax honestly didn’t pay attention\nto all of the definitions and names for Twinborn; he was called a Crasher,"

Wax honestly didn’t pay attention\nto all of the definitions and names for Twinborn; he was called a Crasher,\nthe mix of a Coinshot and a Skimmer. He rarely bothered to think of\nhimself that way.\nHe began to fill his metalminds—the iron bracers he wore on his upper\narms—draining himself of more weight, making himself even lighter. That\nweight would be stored away for future use. Then, ignoring the more\ncautious part of his mind, he flared his steel and Pushed.\nHe shot upward. The wind became a roar, and the lamp was a good\nanchor—lots of metal, firmly attached to the ground—capable of pushing\nhim quite high. He’d angled slightly, and the building’s stories became a\nblur in front of him. He landed about twenty stories up, just as his Push on\nthe lamp was reaching its limit.\nThis portion of the building had been finished already, the exterior made\nof a molded material that imitated worked stone. Ceramics, he’d heard. It\nwas a common practice for tall buildings, where the lower levels would be\nactual stone, but the higher reaches would use something lighter.\nHe grabbed hold of an outcropping. He wasn’t so light that the wind\ncould push him away—not with his metalminds on his forearms and the\nweapons he wore. His lighter body did make it easier to hold himself in\nplace.\nMist swirled beneath him. It seemed almost playful. He looked upward,\ndeciding his next step. His steel revealed lines of blue to nearby sources of\nmetal, many of which were the structure’s frame. Pushing on any of them\nwould send him away from the building.\nThere, he thought, noting a decent-sized ledge about five feet up. He\nclimbed up the side of the building, gloved fingers sure on the complexly\nornamented surface. A Coinshot quickly learned not to fear heights. He\nhoisted himself up onto the ledge, then dropped a bullet casing, stopping it\nwith his booted foot.\nHe looked upward, judging his trajectory. He drew a vial from his belt,\nthen uncorked it and downed the liquid and steel shavings inside it. He\nhissed through his teeth as the whiskey burned his throat. Good stuff, from\nStagin’s still. Damn, I’m going to miss that when my stock runs out, he\nthought, tucking the vial away.\nMost Allomancers didn’t use whiskey in their metal vials. Most\nAllomancers were missing out on a perfect opportunity. He smiled as his\ninternal steel reserves were restored; then he flared the metal and launched\nhimself.\nHe flew up into the night sky. Unfortunately, the Ironspine was built in\nset-back tiers, the upper stories growing progressively narrower as you went\nhigher. That meant that even though he Pushed himself directly up, he was\nsoon soaring in open darkness, mists around him, the building’s side a good\nten feet away.\nWax reached into his coat and removed his short-barreled shotgun from\nthe long, sleevelike pocket inside. He turned—pointing it outward—braced\nit against his side, and fired.\nHe was light enough that the kick flung him toward the building.

The\nboom of the blast echoed below, but he had spray shot in the shells, too\nsmall and light to hurt anyone when it fell dispersed from such a height.\nHe slammed into the wall of the tower five stories above where he’d\nbeen, and grabbed hold of a spikelike protrusion. The decoration up here\nreally was marvelous. Who did they think would be looking at it? He shook\nhis head. Architects were curious types. Not practical at all, like a good\ngunsmith. Wax climbed to another shelf and jumped upward again.\nThe next jump was enough to get him to the open steelwork lattice of the\nunfinished upper floors. He strolled across a girder, then shimmied up a\nvertical member—his reduced weight making it easy—and climbed atop the\nvery tallest of the beams jutting from the top of the building.\nThe height was dizzying. Even with the mists obscuring the landscape, he\ncould see the double row of lights illuminating the street below. Other lights\nglowed more softly across the town, like the floating candles of a seafarer’s\nocean burial. Only the absence of lights allowed him to pick out the various\nparks and the bay far to the west.\nOnce, this city had felt like home. That was before he’d spent twenty\nyears living out in the dust, where the law was sometimes a distant memory\nand people considered carriages a frivolity. What would Lessie have\nthought of one of these horseless contraptions, with the thin wheels meant\nfor driving on a city’s fine paved streets? Vehicles that ran on oil and grease,\nnot hay and horseshoes?\nHe turned about on his perch. It was difficult to judge locations in the\ndark and the mists, but he did have the advantage of a youth spent in this\nsection of the city. Things had changed, but not that much. He judged the\ndirection, checked his steel reserves, then launched himself out into the\ndarkness.\nHe shot outward in a grand arc above the city, flying for a good half a\nminute on the Push off those enormous girders. The skyscraper became a\nshadowed silhouette behind him, then vanished. Eventually, his impetus ran\nout, and he dropped back through the mists. He let himself fall, quiet. When\nthe lights grew close—and he could see that nobody was below him—he\npointed his shotgun at the ground and pulled the trigger.\nThe jolt punched him upward for a moment, slowing his descent. He\nPushed off the birdshot in the ground to slow him further; he landed easily\nin a soft crouch. He noticed with dissatisfaction that he’d all but ruined\nsome good paving stones with the shot.\nHarmony! he thought. This place really was going to take some getting\nused to. I’m like a horse blundering through a narrow marketplace, he\nthought, hooking his shotgun back under his coat. I need to learn more\nfinesse. Out in the Roughs, he’d been considered a refined gentleman.

He came up and reached for a Sterrion with his\nright hand, his left steadying the shotgun in its sleeve in his coat.\nHe peered into the night. Had his thoughtless shotgun blasts drawn the\nattention of the local constables? The guns fired again, and he frowned. No.\nThose are too distant. Something’s happening.\nThis actually gave him a thrill. He leaped into the air and down the street,\nPushing off that same gate to get height. He landed atop a building; this\narea was filled with three- and four-story apartment structures that had\nnarrow alleyways between. How could people live without any space\naround them? He’d have gone mad.\nHe crossed a few buildings—it was handy that the rooftops were flat—\nand then stopped to listen. His heart beat excitedly, and he realized he’d\nbeen hoping for something like this. It was why he’d been driven to leave\nthe party, to seek out the skyscraper and climb it, to run through the mists.\nBack in Weathering, as the town grew larger, he’d often patrolled at night,\nwatching for trouble.\nHe fingered his Sterrion as another shot was fired, closer this time. He\njudged his distance, then dropped a bullet casing and Pushed himself into\nthe air. He’d restored his weight to three-quarters and left it there. You\nneeded some weight on you to fight effectively.\nThe mists swirled and spun, teasing him. One could never tell which\nnights would bring out the mists; they didn’t conform to normal weather\npatterns. A night could be humid and chill, and yet not a wisp of mists\nwould appear. Another night could begin dry as brittle leaves, but the mists\nwould consume it.\nThey were thin this night, and so visibility was still good. Another crack\nbroke the silence. There, Wax thought. Steel burning with a comfortable\nwarmth within him, he leaped over another street in a flurry of mistcoat\ntassels, spinning mist, and calling wind.\nHe landed softly, then raised his gun in front of him as he ran in a crouch\nacross the roof. He reached the edge and looked down. Just below him,\nsomeone had taken refuge behind a pile of boxes near the mouth of an alley.\nIn the dark, misty night, Wax couldn’t make out many details, but the\nperson was armed with a rifle resting on a box. The barrel was pointed\ntoward a group of people down the street who wore the distinctive domed\nhats of city constables.\nWax Pushed out lightly from himself in all directions, setting up his steel\nbubble. A latch on a trapdoor at his feet rattled as his Allomancy affected it.\nHe peered down at the man firing upon the constables. It would be good to\ndo something of actual value in this city, rather than just standing around\nchatting with the overdressed and the overprivileged.\nHe dropped a bullet casing, and his Allomancy pressed it down onto the\nrooftop beneath him.

He decreased his weight dramatically and\npushed on a window latch as he fell, positioning himself so he landed right\nin the middle of the alleyway.\nWith his steel, he could see lines pointing toward four different figures in\nfront of him. Even as he landed—the men muttering curses and spinning\ntoward him—he raised his Sterrion and sighted on the first of the street\nthugs. The man had a patchy beard and eyes as dark as the night itself.\nWax heard a woman whimpering.\nHe froze, hand steady, but unable to move. The memories, so carefully\ndammed up in his head, crashed through and flooded his mind. Lessie, held\nwith a garrote around her neck. A single shot. Blood on the redbrick walls.\nThe street thug jerked his rifle toward Wax and fired. The steel bubble\nbarely deflected it, and the bullet tugged through the fabric of Wax’s coat,\njust missing his ribs.\nHe tried to fire, but that whimpering …\nOh, Harmony, he thought, appalled at himself. He pointed his gun\ndownward and fired into the ground, then Pushed on the bullet and threw\nhimself backward, up out of the alleyway.\nBullets pierced the mists all around him. Steel bubble or not, he should\nhave fallen to one of them. It was pure luck that saved his life as he landed\non another roof and rolled to a stop, prone, protected from the gunfire by a\nparapet wall.\nWax gasped for breath, hand on his revolver. Idiot, he thought to himself.\nFool. He’d never frozen in combat before, even when he’d been green.\nNever. This, however, was the first time he’d tried to shoot someone since\nthe disaster in the ruined church.\nHe wanted to duck away in shame, but he gritted his teeth and crawled\nforward to the edge of the roof. The men were still down there. He could\nsee them better now, gathering and preparing to make a run for it. They\nprobably wanted nothing to do with an Allomancer.\nHe aimed at the apparent leader. However, before Wax could fire, the\nman fell to gunfire from the constables. In moments, the alleyway swarmed\nwith men in uniforms. Wax raised his Sterrion beside his head, breathing\ndeeply.\nI could have fired that time, he told himself. It was just that one moment\nwhere I froze. It wouldn’t have happened again. He told himself this several\ntimes as the constables pulled the malefactors out of the alley one at a time.\nThere was no woman. The whimpering he’d heard had been a gang\nmember who’d taken a bullet before Wax arrived. The man was still\ngroaning in pain as they took him away.\nThe constables hadn’t seen Wax.

Wax\ndropped a coin and bounded over the front fence, landing atop the\ngatehouse. My carriage is back, he noticed. Not surprising. They were\ngetting used to him; he wasn’t certain whether to be pleased by that or\nashamed of it.\nHe Pushed off the gates—which rattled at the weight—and landed on a\nfourth-story balcony. Coinshots had to learn precision, unlike their cousin\nAllomancers, Ironpullers—also known as Lurchers. Those would just pick a\ntarget and Pull themselves toward it, but they usually had to grind up the\nside of a building, making noise. Coinshots had to be delicate, careful,\naccurate.\nThe window was unlatched; he’d left it that way. He didn’t fancy dealing\nwith people at the moment; his abortive confrontation with the criminals\nhad rattled him. He slipped into the darkened room, then padded across it\nand listened at the door. No sounds in the hallway. He opened the door\nsilently, then moved out.\nThe hallway was dark, and he was no Tineye, capable of enhancing his\nsenses. He felt his way with each step, being careful not to trip on the edge\nof a rug or bump into a pedestal.\nHis rooms were at the end of the hallway. He reached for the brass knob\nwith gloved fingers. Excellent. He carefully pushed the door open, stepping\ninto his bedroom. Now he just had to—\nA door opened on the other side of his room, letting in bright yellow\nlight. Wax froze in place, though his hand quickly reached into his coat for\none of his Sterrions.\nAn aging man stood in the doorway, holding a large candelabrum. He\nwore a tidy black uniform and white gloves. He raised an eyebrow at Wax.\n“High Lord Ladrian,” he said, “I see that you’ve returned.”\n“Um…” Wax said, sheepishly removing his hand from inside his coat.\n“Your bath is drawn, my lord.”\n“I didn’t ask for a bath.”\n“Yes, but considering your night’s … entertainments, I thought it prudent\nto prepare one for you.” The butler sniffed. “Gunpowder?”\n“Er, yes.”\n“I trust my lord didn’t shoot anyone too important.”\nNo, Wax thought. No, I couldn’t.\nTillaume stood there, stiff, disapproving. He didn’t say the words he was\nundoubtedly thinking: that Wax’s disappearance from the party had caused\na minor scandal, that it would be even more difficult to procure a proper\nbride now. He didn’t say that he was disappointed. He didn’t say these\nthings because he was, after all, a proper lord’s servant.\nBesides, he could say them all with a glance anyway.\n“Shall I draft a letter of apology to Lady Cett, my lord? I believe she will\nexpect it, considering that you sent one to Lord Stanton.”\n“Yes, that would be well,” Wax said. He lowered his fingers to his belt,\nfeeling the metal vials there, the revolver at each hip, the weight of the\nshotgun strapped inside his coat. What am I doing?

Leaving a party to go patrolling\nthrough the city, looking for trouble? What was wrong with him?\nHe felt as if he’d been trying to recapture something. A part of the person\nhe’d been before Lessie’s death. He had known, deep down, that he might\nhave trouble shooting now and had wanted to prove otherwise.\nHe’d failed that test.\n“My lord,” Tillaume said, stepping closer. “May I speak … boldly, for a\nmoment?”\n“You may.”\n“The city has a large number of constables,” Tillaume said. “And they are\nquite capable in their jobs. Our house, however, has but one high lord.\nThousands depend on you, sir.” Tillaume nodded his head in respect, then\nmoved to begin lighting some candles in the bedroom.\nThe butler’s words were true. House Ladrian was one of the most\npowerful in the city, at least historically. In the city’s government, Wax\nrepresented the interests of all of the people his house employed. True,\nthey’d also have a representative based on votes in their guild, but it was\nWax they depended on most.\nHis house was nearly bankrupt—rich in potential, in holdings, and in\nworkers, but poor in cash and connections because of his uncle’s\nfoolishness. If Wax didn’t do something to change that, it could mean jobs\nlost, poverty, and collapse as other houses pounced on his holdings and\nseized them for debts not paid.\nWax ran his thumbs along his Sterrions. The constables handled those\nstreet toughs just fine, he admitted to himself. They didn’t need me. This city\ndoesn’t need me, not like Weathering did.\nHe was trying to cling to what he had been. He wasn’t that person any\nlonger. He couldn’t be. But people did need him for something else.\n“Tillaume,” Wax said.\nThe butler looked back from the candles. The mansion didn’t have\nelectric lights yet, though workmen were coming to install them soon.\nSomething his uncle had paid for before dying, money Wax couldn’t\nrecover now.\n“Yes, my lord?” Tillaume asked.\nWax hesitated, then slowly pulled his shotgun from its place inside his\ncoat and set it into the trunk beside his bed, placing it beside a companion\nhe’d left there earlier. He took off his mistcoat, wrapping the thick material\nover his arm. He held the coat reverently for a moment, then placed it in the\ntrunk. His Sterrion revolvers followed. They weren’t his only guns, but they\nrepresented his life in the Roughs.\nHe closed the lid of the trunk on his old life. “Take this, Tillaume,” Wax\nsaid. “Put it somewhere.”\n“Yes, my lord,” Tillaume said. “I shall have it ready for you, should you\nneed it again.”\n“I won’t be needing it,” Wax said. He had given himself one last night\nwith the mists. A thrilling climb up the tower, an evening spent with the\ndarkness. He chose to focus on that—rather than his failure with the toughs\n—as his night’s accomplishment.\nOne final dance.\n“Take it, Tillaume,” Wax said, turning away from the trunk. “Put it"

Wax\nthe lawkeeper was gone.\nIt was time to be Lord Waxillium Ladrian, Sixteenth High Lord of House\nLadrian, residing in the Fourth Octant of Elendel City.\n2\nSIX MONTHS LATER\n“How’s my cravat?” Waxillium asked, studying himself in the mirror,\nturning to the side and tugging at the silver necktie again.\n“Impeccable as always, my lord,” Tillaume said. The butler stood with\nhands clasped behind his back, a tray with steaming tea sitting beside him\non the serving stand. Waxillium hadn’t asked for tea, but Tillaume had\nbrought it anyway. Tillaume had a thing about tea.\n“Are you certain?” Waxillium asked, tugging at the cravat again.\n“Indeed, my lord.” He hesitated. “I’ll admit, my lord, that I’ve been\ncurious about this for months. You are the first high lord I’ve ever waited\nupon who can tie a decent cravat. I’d grown quite accustomed to providing\nthat assistance.”\n“You learn to do things on your own, when you live out in the Roughs.”\n“With all due respect, my lord,” Tillaume said, his normally monotone\nvoice betraying a hint of curiosity, “I wouldn’t have thought that one would\nneed to learn that skill in the Roughs. I wasn’t aware that the denizens of\nthose lands had the slightest concern for matters of fashion and decorum.”\n“They don’t,” Waxillium said with a smile, giving one final adjustment to\nthe cravat. “That’s part of why I always did. Dressing like a city gentleman\nhad an odd effect on the people out there. Some immediately respected me,\nothers immediately underestimated me. It worked for me in both cases.\nAnd, I might add, it was unspeakably satisfying to see the looks on the\nfaces of criminals when they were hauled in by someone they had assumed\nto be a city dandy.”\n“I can imagine, my lord.”\n“I did it for myself too,” Waxillium said more softly, regarding himself in\nthe mirror. Silver cravat, green satin vest. Emerald cuff links. Black coat\nand trousers, stiff through the sleeves and legs.

The land around me may have been wild, but I didn’t\nneed to be.”\nWaxillium took a silver pocket square off his dressing stand, deftly\nfolded it in the proper style, and slipped it into his breast pocket. A sudden\nchiming rang through the mansion.\n“Rust and Ruin,” Waxillium cursed, checking his pocket watch. “They’re\nearly.”\n“Lord Harms is known for his punctuality, my lord.”\n“Wonderful.

        "text": "“Wonderful. Well, let’s get this over with.” Waxillium strode out into the\nhallway, boots gliding on the green velvet-cut rug. The mansion had\nchanged little during his two-decade absence. Even after six months of\nliving here, it still didn’t feel like it was his. The faint smell of his uncle’s\npipe smoke still lingered, and the decor was marked by a fondness for deep\ndark woods and heavy stone sculpture. Despite modern tastes, there were\nalmost no portraits or paintings. As Waxillium knew, many of those had\nbeen valuable, and had been sold before his uncle’s death.\nTillaume walked alongside him, hands clasped behind his back. “My lord\nsounds as though he considers this day’s duty to be a chore.”\n“Is it that obvious?” Waxillium grimaced. What did it say about him that\nhe’d rather face down a nest of outlaws—outgunned and outmanned—than\nmeet with Lord Harms and his daughter?\nA plump, matronly woman waited at the end of the hallway, wearing a\nblack dress and a white apron. “Oh, Lord Ladrian,” she said with fondness.\n“Your mother would be so pleased to see this day!”\n“Nothing has been decided yet, Miss Grimes,” Waxillium said as the\nwoman joined the two of them, walking along the balustrade of the second-\nfloor gallery.\n“She did so hope that you’d marry a fine lady someday,” Miss Grimes\nsaid. “You should have heard how she worried, all those years.”\nWaxillium tried to ignore the way those words twisted at his heart. He\nhadn’t heard how his mother worried. He’d hardly ever taken time to write\nhis parents or his sister, and had only visited that one time, just after the\nrailway reached Weathering.\nWell, he was making good on his obligations now. Six months of work,\nand he was finally getting his feet under him and pulling House Ladrian—\nalong with its many forgeworkers and seamstresses—from the brink of\nfinancial collapse. The last step came today.\nWaxillium reached the top of the staircase, then hesitated. “No,” he said,\n“I mustn’t rush in. Need to give them time to make themselves\ncomfortable.”\n“That is—” Tillaume began, but Waxillium cut him off by turning the\nother way and marching back along the balustrade.\n“Miss Grimes,” Waxillium said, “are there other matters that will need\nmy attention today?”\n“You wish to hear of them now?” she asked, frowning as she bustled to\nkeep up.\n“Anything to keep my mind occupied, dear woman,” Waxillium said.\nRust and Ruin … he was so nervous that he caught himself reaching inside\nhis jacket to finger the grip of his Immerling 44-S.\nIt was a fine weapon; not as good as one of Ranette’s make, but a proper,\nand small, sidearm for a gentleman. He’d decided he would be a lord, and\nnot a lawman, but that didn’t mean he was going to go about unarmed.\nThat … well, that would just be plain insane.\n“There is one matter,” Miss Grimes said, grimacing. She was the Ladrian\nhouse steward, and had been for the last twenty years. “We lost another"

        "text": "That … well, that would just be plain insane.\n“There is one matter,” Miss Grimes said, grimacing. She was the Ladrian\nhouse steward, and had been for the last twenty years. “We lost another\nshipment of steel last night.”\nWaxillium froze on the walkway. “What? Again!”\n“Unfortunately, my lord.”\n“Damn it. I’m starting to think the thieves are targeting only us.”\n“It’s only our second shipment,” she said. “House Tekiel has lost five\nshipments so far.”\n“What are the details?” he asked. “The disappearance. Where did it\nhappen?”\n“Well—”\n“No, don’t tell me,” he said, raising a hand. “I can’t afford to be\ndistracted.”\nMiss Grimes gave him a flat look, since that was probably why she’d\navoided telling him about it before his meeting with Lord Harms.\nWaxillium rested a hand on the railing, and felt his left eye twitch. Someone\nwas out there, running an organized, highly efficient operation stealing the\ncontents of entire railcars. They were being called the Vanishers. Perhaps he\ncould poke around a little and …\nNo, he told himself sternly. It is not my duty. Not anymore. He would go\nto the proper authorities, perhaps hire some guards or personal\ninvestigators. He would not go chasing bandits himself.\n“I’m sure the constables will find those responsible and bring them to\njustice,” Waxillium said with some difficulty. “Do you think that’s long\nenough to make Lord Harms wait? I think that’s long enough. It hasn’t been\ntoo long, has it?” Waxillium turned and walked back the way he’d come.\nTillaume rolled his eyes as he passed.\nWaxillium reached the stairs. A young man in a green Ladrian vest and a\nwhite shirt was climbing them. “Lord Ladrian!” Kip said. “Post has\narrived.”\n“Any parcels?”\n“No, my lord,” the boy said, handing over a signet-sealed letter as\nWaxillium passed. “Only this. Looked important.”\n“An invitation to the Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner,” Miss Grimes\nguessed. “Might be a good place to have your first public appearance with\nMiss Harms.”\n“The details haven’t been decided!” Waxillium protested as they stopped\nat the bottom of the staircase. “I’ve barely broached the topic with Lord\nHarms, yet you practically have us married. It’s entirely possible that they\nwill upend this entire matter, like what happened with Lady Entrone.”\n“It will go well, young master,” Miss Grimes said. She reached up,\nadjusting the silk square in his pocket. “I’ve got a Soother’s sense for these\nmatters.”\n“You do realize I’m forty-two years old? ‘Young master’ doesn’t exactly\nfit any longer.”\nShe patted his cheek. Miss Grimes considered any unmarried man to be a\nchild—which was terribly unfair, considering that she had never married.\nHe refrained from speaking to her about Lessie; most of his family back in\nthe city hadn’t known about her.\n“Right, then,” Waxillium said, turning and striding toward the sitting\nroom. “Into the maw of the beast I go.”"

She raised\nher hand as Waxillium approached, as if to speak, but he slid the dinner-\nparty invitation between two of her fingers.\n“Have an affirmative response drafted to this, if you would, Limmi,” he\nsaid. “Indicate I’ll be dining with Miss Harms and her father, but hold the\nletter until I’m done with my conference here. I’ll let you know whether to\nsend it or not.”\n“Yes, my lord, but—”\n“It’s all right,” he said, pushing the door open. “I mustn’t keep the…”\nLord Harms and his daughter were not in the sitting room. Instead,\nWaxillium found a lanky man with a round, sharp-chinned face. He was\nabout thirty years of age, and had a few days of stubble on the chin and\ncheeks. He wore a wide-brimmed Roughs-style hat, the sides curving up\nslightly, and had on a leather duster. He was playing with one of the palm-\nsized upright clocks on the mantel.\n“’Ello Wax,” the man said brightly. He held up the clock. “Can I trade\nyou for this?”\nWaxillium swiftly pulled the door shut behind him. “Wayne? What are\nyou doing here?”\n“Looking at your stuff, mate,” Wayne said. He held up the clock\nappraisingly. “Worth what, three or four bars? I’ve got a bottle of good\nwhiskey that might be worth the same.”\n“You have to get out of here!” Waxillium said. “You’re supposed to be in\nWeathering. Who’s watching the place?”\n“Barl.”\n“Barl! He’s a miscreant.”\n“So am I.”\n“Yes, but you’re the miscreant I chose to do the job. You could have at\nleast sent for Miles.”\n“Miles?” Wayne said. “Mate, Miles is a right horrible human being.\nHe’d rather shoot a man than bother actually finding out if the bloke was\nguilty or not.”\n“Miles keeps his town clean,” Waxillium said. “And he’s saved my life a\ncouple of times. This is beside the point. I told you to watch over\nWeathering.”\nWayne tipped his hat to Waxillium. “True, Wax, but you ain’t a\nlawkeeper no longer. And me, I’ve got important stuff to be about.” He\nlooked at the clock, then pocketed it and set a small bottle of whiskey on\nthe mantel in its place. “Now, sir, I’ll need to be asking you a few\nquestions.” He pulled a small notepad and pencil from inside his duster.\n“Where were you last night at around midnight?”\n“What does that—”\nWaxillium was interrupted by chimes sounding at the door again. “Rust\nand Ruin! These are high-class people, Wayne. I’ve spent months\npersuading them that I’m not a ruffian. I need you out of here.” Waxillium\nwalked forward, trying to usher his friend toward the far exit."

I need you out of here.” Waxillium\nwalked forward, trying to usher his friend toward the far exit.\n“Now, that’s right suspicious behavior, innit?” Wayne said, scrawling\nsomething on his notepad. “Dodging questions, acting all anxious. What are\nyou hiding, sir?”\n“Wayne,” Waxillium said, grabbing the other man’s arm. “Part of me is\nappreciative that you’d come all this way to aggravate me, and I am glad to\nsee you. But now is not the time.”\nWayne grinned. “You assume I’m here for you. Don’t you think that’s a\npinch arrogant?”\n“What else would you be here for?”\n“Shipment of foodstuffs,” Wayne said. “Railway car left Elendel four\ndays ago and arrived in Weathering with the entire contents of a single car\nempty. Now, I hear that you recently lost two shipments of your own to\nthese ‘Vanishers.’ I’ve come to question you. Right suspicious, as I said.”\n“Suspicious … Wayne, I lost two shipments. I’m the one who got\nrobbed! Why would that make me a suspect?”\n“How am I to know how your devious, criminal genius mind works,\nmate?”\nFootsteps sounded outside the room. Waxillium glanced at the door, then\nback at Wayne. “Right now, my criminal genius mind is wondering if I can\nstuff your corpse anywhere that wouldn’t be too obvious.”\nWayne grinned, stepping back.\nThe door opened.\nWaxillium spun, looking as Limmi sheepishly held the door open. A\ncorpulent man in a very fine suit stood there, holding a dark wooden cane.\nHe had mustaches that drooped all the way down to his thick neck, and his\nwaistcoat framed a deep red cravat.\n“… saying it doesn’t matter whom he’s seeing!” Lord Harms said. “He’ll\nwant to speak with me! We had an appointment, and…” Lord Harms\npaused, realizing the door was open. “Ah!” He strode into the room.\nHe was followed by a stern-looking woman with golden hair fixed into a\ntight bun—his daughter, Steris—and a younger woman who Waxillium\ndidn’t recognize.\n“Lord Ladrian,” Harms said, “I find it very unbefitting to be made to\nwait. And who is this that you’re meeting with in my stead?”\nWaxillium sighed. “It’s my old—”\n“Uncle!” Wayne said, stepping forward, voice altered to sound gruff and\nlose all of its rural accent. “I’m his uncle Maksil. Popped in unexpectedly\nthis morning, my dear man.”\nWaxillium raised an eyebrow as Wayne stepped forward. He’d removed\nhis hat and duster, and had plastered his upper lip with a realistic-looking\nfake mustache with a bit of gray in it. He was scrunching his face up just\nslightly to produce a few extra wrinkles at the eyes. It was a good disguise,\nmaking him look like he might be a few years older than Waxillium, rather\nthan ten years younger.\nWaxillium glanced over his shoulder. The duster sat folded on the floor"

        "text": "making him look like he might be a few years older than Waxillium, rather\nthan ten years younger.\nWaxillium glanced over his shoulder. The duster sat folded on the floor\nbeside one of the couches, hat atop it, a pair of dueling canes lying crossed\nbeside the pile. Waxillium hadn’t even noticed the swap—of course, Wayne\nhad naturally done it while inside a speed bubble. Wayne was a Slider, a\nbendalloy Allomancer, capable of creating a bubble of compressed time\naround himself. He often used the power to change costumes.\nHe was also Twinborn, like Waxillium, though his Feruchemical ability\n—healing quickly from wounds—wasn’t so useful outside of combat. Still,\nthe two made for a very potent combination.\n“Uncle, you say?” Lord Harms asked, taking Wayne’s hand and shaking\nit.\n“On the mother’s side!” Wayne said. “Not the Ladrian side, of course.\nOtherwise I’d be running this place, eh?” He sounded nothing like himself,\nbut that was Wayne’s specialty. He said that three-quarters of a disguise was\nin the accent and voice. “I’ve wanted for a long time to come check up on\nthe lad. He’s had something of a rough-and-tumble past, you know. He\nneeds a firm hand to make certain he doesn’t return to such unpleasant\nways.”\n“I’ve often thought the very same thing!” Lord Harms said. “I assume\nwe’re given leave to sit, Lord Ladrian?”\n“Yes, of course,” Waxillium said, covertly glaring at Wayne. Really? that\nglare said. We’re doing this?\nWayne just shrugged. Then he turned and took Steris’s hand and bowed\nhis head politely. “And who is this lovely creature?”\n“My daughter, Steris.” Harms sat. “Lord Ladrian? You didn’t tell your\nuncle of our arrival?”\n“I was so surprised by his appearance,” Waxillium said, “that I did not\nhave an opportunity.” He took Steris’s hand and bowed his head to her as\nwell.\nShe looked him up and down with a critical gaze, and then her eyes\nflicked toward the duster and hat in the corner. Her lips turned down.\nDoubtless she assumed they were his.\n“This is my cousin Marasi,” Steris said, nodding to the woman behind\nher. Marasi was dark-haired and large-eyed, with bright red lips. She looked\ndown demurely as soon as Waxillium turned to her. “She has spent most of\nher life in the Outer Estates and is rather timid, so please don’t upset her.”\n“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Waxillium said. He waited until the women\nwere seated beside Lord Harms, then sat on the smaller sofa facing them,\nand facing the doorway. There was another exit from the room, but he’d\ndiscovered that there was a squeaky floorboard leading to it, which was\nideal. This way, someone couldn’t sneak up on him. Lawman or lord, he\ndidn’t fancy getting shot in the back.\nWayne primly settled himself in a chair directly to Waxillium’s right.\nThey all stared at one another for an extended moment. Wayne yawned.\n“Well,” Waxillium said. “Perhaps I should begin by asking after your\nhealth.”"

Wayne yawned.\n“Well,” Waxillium said. “Perhaps I should begin by asking after your\nhealth.”\n“Perhaps you should,” Steris replied.\n“Er. Yes. How’s your health?”\n“Suitable.”\n“So is Waxillium,” Wayne added.\nThey all turned to him.\n“You know,” he said. “He’s wearing a suit, and all. Suitable. Ahem. Is\nthat mahogany?”\n“This?” Lord Harms said, holding up his cane. “Indeed. It’s a family\nheirloom.”\n“My lord Waxillium,” Steris cut in, voice stern. She did not seem to\nenjoy small talk. “Perhaps we can dispense with empty prattle. We all know\nthe nature of this meeting.”\n“We do?” Wayne asked.\n“Yes,” Steris said, voice cool. “Lord Waxillium. You are in the position\nof having an unfortunate reputation. Your uncle, may he rest with the Hero,\ntarnished the Ladrian name with his social reclusiveness, occasional\nreckless forays into politics, and blatant adventurism. You have come from\nthe Roughs, lending no small additional measure of poor reputation to the\nhouse, particularly considering your insulting actions to various houses\nduring your first few weeks in town. Above all this, your house is nearly\ndestitute.\n“We, however, are in a desperate circumstance of our own. Our financial\nstatus is excellent, but our name is unknown in the highest of society. My\nfather has no male heir upon which to bestow his family name, and so a\nunion between our houses makes perfect sense.”\n“How very logical of you, my dear,” Wayne said, the upper-class accent\nrolling off his tongue as if he’d been born with it.\n“Indeed,” she said, still watching Waxillium. She reached into her\nsatchel. “Your letters and conversations with my father have been enough to\npersuade us of your serious intent, and during these last few months in the\ncity your public comportment has proven more promisingly sober than your\ninitial boorishness. So I have taken the liberty of drawing up an agreement\nthat I think will suit our needs.”\n“An … agreement?” Waxillium asked.\n“Oh, I’m so eager to see it,” Wayne added. He reached into his pocket\nabsently and got out something that Waxillium couldn’t quite discern.\nThe “agreement” turned out to be a large document, at least twenty pages\nlong. Steris handed one copy to Waxillium and one to her father, and\nretained another for herself.\nLord Harms coughed into his hand. “I suggested she write down her\nthoughts,” he said. “And … well, my daughter is a very thorough woman.”\n“I can see that,” Waxillium said.\n“I suggest that you never ask her to pass the milk,” Wayne added under\nhis breath, so only Waxillium could hear. “As she seems likely to throw a\ncow at you, just to be certain the job is done thoroughly.”\n“The document is in several parts,” Steris said. “The first is an outline of\nour courtship phase, wherein we make obvious—but not too speedy—\nprogress toward engagement. We take just long enough for society to begin\nassociating us as a couple. The engagement mustn’t be so quick as to seem"

The engagement mustn’t be so quick as to seem\na scandal, but cannot come too slowly either. Eight months should, by my\nestimates, fulfill our purposes.”\n“I see,” Waxillium said, flipping through the pages. Tillaume entered,\nbringing a tray of tea and cakes, and deposited it on a serving table beside\nWayne.\nWaxillium shook his head, closing the contract. “Doesn’t this seem a\nlittle … stiff to you?”\n“Stiff?”\n“I mean, shouldn’t there be room for romance?”\n“There is,” Steris said. “Page thirteen. Upon marriage, there shall be no\nmore than three conjugal encounters per week and no fewer than one until a\nsuitable heir is provided. After that, the same numbers apply to a two-week\nspan.”\n“Ah, of course,” Waxillium said. “Page thirteen.” He glanced at Wayne.\nWas that a bullet the other man had taken from his pocket? Wayne was\nrolling it between his fingers.\n“If that is not enough to satisfy your needs,” Steris added, “the next page\ndetails proper mistress protocols.”\n“Wait,” Waxillium said, looking away from Wayne. “Your document\nallows mistresses?”\n“Of course,” Steris said. “They are a simple fact of life, and so it’s better\nto account for them than to ignore them. In the document, you will find\nrequirements for your potential mistresses along with the means by which\ndiscretion will be maintained.”\n“I see,” Waxillium said.\n“Of course,” Steris continued, “I will follow the same guidelines.”\n“You plan to take a mistress, my lady?” Wayne asked, perking up.\n“I would be allowed my own dalliances,” she said. “Usually the\ncoachman is the object of choice. I would abstain until heirs were produced,\nof course. There mustn’t be any confusion about lineage.”\n“Of course,” Waxillium said.\n“It’s in the contract,” she said. “Page fifteen.”\n“I don’t doubt that it is.”\nLord Harms coughed into his hand again. Marasi, Steris’s cousin,\nmaintained a blank expression, though she looked down at her feet during\nthe conversation. Why had she been brought?\n“Daughter,” Lord Harms said, “perhaps we should move the conversation\nto less personal topics for a span.”\n“Very well,” Steris said. “There are a few things I wanted to know. Are\nyou a religious man, Lord Ladrian?”\n“I follow the Path,” Waxillium said.\n“Hmmm,” she said, tapping her fingers against her contract. “Well, that’s\na safe choice, if somewhat dull. I, for one, have never understood why\npeople would follow a religion whose god specifically prohibits\nworshipping him.”\n“It’s complicated.”\n“So Pathians like to say. With the same breath as you try to explain how\nsimple your religion is.”\n“That’s complicated too,” Waxillium said. “A simple kind of\ncomplicated, though. You’re a Survivorist, I assume?”\n“I am.”\nDelightful, Waxillium thought. Well, Survivorists weren’t too bad. Some"

Wayne was still playing with that round.\n“Would anyone else like some tea?”\n“No,” Steris said with a wave of her hand, looking through her document.\n“Yes, please,” Marasi said softly.\nWaxillium crossed the room to the tea stand.\n“Those are very nice bookshelves,” Wayne said. “Wish I had shelves like\nthose. My, my, my. And … we’re in.”\nWaxillium turned. The three guests had glanced at the shelves, and as\nthey turned away, Wayne had started burning bendalloy and thrown up a\nspeed bubble.\nThe bubble was about five feet across, including only Wayne and\nWaxillium, and once Wayne had it up he couldn’t move it. Years of\nfamiliarity let Waxillium discern the boundary of the bubble, which was\nmarked by a faint wavering of the air. For those inside the bubble, time\nwould flow much more quickly than for those outside.\n“Well?” Waxillium asked.\n“Oh, I think the quiet one’s kinda cute,” Wayne said, his accent back in\nplace. “The tall one is insane, though. Rust on my arms, but she is.”\nWaxillium poured himself some tea. Harms and the two women looked\nfrozen as they sat on their couch, almost like statues. Wayne was flaring his\nmetal, using as much strength as he could to create a few private moments.\nThese bubbles could be very useful, though not in the way most people\nexpected. You couldn’t shoot out of them—well, you could, but something\nabout the barrier interfered with objects passing through it. If you fired a\nshot in a speed bubble, the bullet would slow as soon as it hit ordinary time\nand would be moved erratically off course. That made it nearly impossible\nto aim from within one.\n“She’s a very good match,” Waxillium said. “It’s an ideal situation for\nboth of us.”\n“Look, mate. Just because Lessie—”\n“This is not about Lessie.”\n“Whoa, hey.” Wayne raised a hand. “No need to get angry.”\n“I’m not—” Waxillium took a deep breath, then continued more softly.\n“I’m not angry. But it’s not about Lessie. This is about my duties.”\nDamn you, Wayne. I’d almost gotten myself to stop thinking about her.\nWhat would Lessie say, if she saw what he was doing? Laugh, probably.\nLaugh at how ridiculous it was, laugh at his discomfort. She hadn’t been the\njealous type, perhaps because she’d never had any reason to be. With a\nwoman like her, why would Waxillium have wanted to look elsewhere?\nNobody would ever live up to her, but fortunately it didn’t matter. Steris’s\ncontract actually seemed a good thing, in that regard. It would help him\ndivide himself. Maybe help with a little of the pain.\n“This is my duty now,” Waxillium repeated.\n“Your duties used to involve saving folks,” Wayne said, “not marrying\n’em.”\nWaxillium crouched down beside the chair. “Wayne. I can’t go back to"

I’m a different person now.”\n“If you were going to become a different person, couldn’t you have\nchosen one without such an ugly face?”\n“Wayne, this is serious.”\nWayne raised his hand, spinning the cartridge between his fingers and\nproffering it. “So is this.”\n“What is that?”\n“Bullet. You shoot folks with ’em. Hopefully bad ones—or at least ones\nwhat owes you a bar or two.”\n“Wayne—”\n“They’re turning back.” Wayne set the cartridge on the tea-serving tray.\n“But—”\n“Time to cough. Three. Two. One.”\nWaxillium cursed under his breath, but pocketed the round and stood\nback up. He started coughing loudly as the speed bubble collapsed,\nrestoring normal time. To the three visitors, only seconds had passed, and to\ntheir ears Waxillium and Wayne’s conversation would be sped up to the\npoint that most of it would be inaudible. The coughing would cover\nanything else.\nNone of the three visitors seemed to have noticed anything unusual.\nWaxillium poured the tea—it was a deep cherry color today, likely a sweet\nfruit tea—and brought a cup over to Marasi. She took it, and he sat down,\nholding his own cup in one hand, taking out and gripping the cartridge with\nthe other. Both the casing and the medium-caliber bullet’s jacket looked like\nsteel, but the entire thing seemed too light. He frowned, hefting it.\nBlood on her face. Blood on the brick wall.\nHe shivered, fighting off those memories. Damn you, Wayne, he thought\nagain.\n“The tea is delicious,” Marasi said softly. “Thank you.”\n“You’re welcome,” Waxillium said, forcing his mind back to the\nconversation. “Lady Steris, I will consider this contract. Thank you for\nproducing it. But really, I was hoping this meeting might allow me to learn\nmore about you.”\n“I have been working on an autobiography,” she said. “Perhaps I will\nsend you a chapter or two of it by post.”\n“That’s … very unconventional of you,” Waxillium said. “Though it\nwould be appreciated. But please, tell me of yourself. What are your\ninterests?”\n“Normally, I like plays.” She grimaced. “At the Coolerim, actually.”\n“Am I missing something?” Waxillium asked.\n“The Coolerim Playhouse,” Wayne said, leaning forward. “Two nights\nago, it was robbed in the middle of the performance.”\n“Haven’t you heard?” Lord Harms asked. “It was in all the broadsheets.”\n“Was anyone harmed?”\n“Not at the event itself,” Lord Harms said, “but they did take a hostage as\nthey escaped.”\n“Such a horrid thing,” Steris said. “Nobody has heard from Armal yet.”\nShe looked sick.\n“You knew her?” Wayne asked, his accent slipping faintly as he grew\ninterested.\n“Cousin,” Steris said.\n“Same as…” Waxillium asked, nodding toward Marasi."

And vehicles for escaping. Impressive.”\n“It’s the Vanishers,” Marasi said. “The ones stealing from the railway\nalso.”\n“That hasn’t been proven,” Wayne replied, pointing at her.\n“No. But one of the witnesses from a railway robbery described several\nmen who were at the theater robbery.”\n“Wait,” Waxillium said. “There were witnesses to one of the railway\nrobberies? I thought they happened in secret. Something about a ghostly\nrailcar appearing on the tracks?”\n“Yes,” Wayne said. “The railway engineers stop to investigate and—\nprobably—panic. But the phantom railcar vanishes before they can\ninvestigate it. They continue on, but when they reach the end of the line,\none of their train’s cars is empty. Still locked, no signs of forced entry. But\nthe goods are all gone.”\n“So nobody sees the culprits,” Waxillium said.\n“The recent ones have been different,” Marasi said, growing animated.\n“They’ve started robbing passenger cars as well. When the train stops\nbecause of the phantom on the tracks, men jump into the cars and start\ngoing through, collecting jewelry and pocketbooks from the occupants.\nThey take a woman hostage—threatening to kill her if anyone follows—and\ngo. The freight car is still robbed as well.”\n“Curious,” Waxillium said.\n“Yes,” Marasi said. “I think—”\n“My dear,” Lord Harms cut in. “You are bothering Lord Ladrian.”\nMarasi blushed, then looked down.\n“It wasn’t a bother,” Waxillium said, tapping his teacup with his finger.\n“It—”\n“Is that a bullet in your fingers?” Steris asked, pointing.\nWaxillium looked down, realizing that he was rolling the cartridge\nbetween forefinger and thumb. He closed his fist around it before his\nmemories could return. “It’s nothing.” He shot a glare at Wayne.\nThe other man mouthed something. Push on it.\n“You are quite certain your unconventional past is behind you, Lord\nLadrian?” Steris asked.\n“Oh, he’s certain,” Wayne said, grimacing. “You don’t have to worry\nabout him being unconventional. Why, he’s downright boring!\nUnbelievably, comically, nonsensically boring. You could squeeze more\nexcitement out of a beggar waiting in line at the soup kitchen on rat meat\nday. It—”\n“Thank you, Uncle,” Waxillium said dryly. “Yes, Steris, my past is just\nthat. Past. I am committed to my duties as head of House Ladrian.”"

I am committed to my duties as head of House Ladrian.”\n“Very well,” she said. “We will need a formal entrance into high society\nas a couple. A public event of some sort.”\n“How about the Yomen-Ostlin wedding dinner?” Waxillium said\nabsently. Push on it. “I received an invitation just this morning.”\n“An excellent idea,” Lord Harms said. “We were invited as well.”\nPush on it. Waxillium reached into his left sleeve and covertly took a\nsmall pinch of steel shavings from the pouch he kept there. He dropped it\ninto his tea and took a drink. That didn’t give him much of a reserve, but it\nwas enough.\nHe burned the steel, the familiar lines of blue springing up around him.\nThey pointed to all nearby sources of metal.\nExcept the one in his fingers.\nAluminum, he realized. No wonder it’s light.\nAluminum and a few of its alloys were Allomantically inert; you couldn’t\nPush or Pull on them. It was also very expensive. It cost more than even\ngold or platinum.\nThe bullet was designed to kill Coinshots and Lurchers, men like\nWaxillium himself. That gave him a shiver, though he gripped the round\nmore tightly. There were days when he’d have given his best gun for a few\naluminum bullets, though he hadn’t heard of an alloy that would produce a\nbullet with sound ballistics.\nWhere? he mouthed to Wayne. Where did you find it?\nWayne just nodded to the guests, who were looking right at Waxillium.\n“Are you quite all right, Lord Ladrian?” Steris asked. “I know a good\nzinc counselor if you have need of some emotional aid.”\n“Er … no. Thank you. I am quite all right, and I think this has been a\nvery productive meeting. Wouldn’t you agree?”\n“That depends,” she said, rising, apparently taking that as an invitation to\nend the conversation. “The wedding party is on the morrow, I believe. I can\ncount on you having reviewed the contract by then?”\n“You can,” Waxillium said, rising as well.\n“I think this meeting was wonderful,” Wayne said as he stood. “You’re\njust what my nephew needs, Lady Steris! A firm hand. None of this rabble-\nrousing he’s been used to.”\n“I agree!” Lord Harms said. “Lord Ladrian, perhaps your uncle can\nattend the dinner—”\n“No,” Waxillium said quickly before Wayne could say anything. “No,\nunfortunately, he has to return to his estates. Told me just earlier. He has a\nvery important foaling to attend.”\n“Oh, well then,” Lord Harms said, helping Marasi to her feet. “We will\nsend you word of confirmation once we have accepted the Yomen\ninvitation.”\n“And I will do likewise,” Waxillium said, escorting them to the door of\nthe room. “Farewell until then.” Tillaume bowed to them there, then\nescorted them out.

Nobody had ended up trying to shoot him.\n“Nice bunch,” Wayne said. “I now see what you’re doing. With a wife\nand in-laws like those, you’ll feel quite at home here—just like the\njailhouse and its occupants back in Weathering!”\n“Very nice,” Waxillium said under his breath, waving one last time as the\nHarms family walked out the mansion doors. “Where did you get the\nbullet?”\n“It was dropped at the theater robbery. Traded the constables for it this\nmorning.”\nWaxillium closed his eyes. Wayne had a very liberal interpretation of\nwhat “trading” entailed.\n“Oh, don’t get that way,” Wayne said. “I left them a nice cobblestone for\nit. I think Steris and her pop are convinced you’re a loon, by the way.” He\ngrinned.\n“That’s nothing new. My association with you has been convincing\npeople I’m insane for years now.”\n“Ha! And here I thought you’d lost your sense of humor.” Wayne walked\nback into the room. He slid his pencil out of his pocket as he passed a table,\ntrading it for one of Waxillium’s pens.\n“My humor isn’t lost, Wayne,” Waxillium said, “just strained. What I told\nyou is true, and this bullet doesn’t change anything.”\n“Maybe it doesn’t,” Wayne said, retrieving his hat, duster, and dueling\ncanes. “But I’m still gonna see what I can find.”\n“It’s not your job.”\n“And it wasn’t your job to start hunting down criminals out in the\nRoughs. Doesn’t change what needs to be done, mate.” Wayne walked up to\nWaxillium, then handed him the hat. Once Waxillium took it, Wayne threw\non his coat.\n“Wayne…”\n“People are being taken, Wax,” he said, taking back his hat and putting it\non. “Four hostages so far. None returned. Stealing jewelry is one thing.\nTaking food from Roughs towns is another. Kidnapping people … well,\nthere’s something goin’ on here. I’m gonna find out what it is. With or\nwithout you.”\n“Without me.”\n“Fine.” He hesitated. “But I need something, Wax. A place to look. You\nalways did the thinking.”\n“Yes, having a brain helps with that, surprisingly.”\nWayne narrowed his eyes at him. Then he raised his eyebrows,\npleadingly.\n“All right,” Waxillium said, sighing and fetching his teacup. “How many\nrobberies now?”\n“Eight. Seven railway cars and, most recently, the theater.”\n“Four hostages?”\n“Yeah. Across three of the latest robberies. Two were taken from one of\nthe trains, then one from the robbery at the theater. All four hostages are\nwomen.”\n“Easier to overpower,” Waxillium said idly, tapping his cup, “and more\nlikely to make the men worry about getting them killed if they try to give\nchase.”\n“Do you need to know what was stolen?” Wayne said, reaching into the"

It’s not about the robberies.”\n“It’s … not?”\n“No. Large gang. Well funded—too well funded.” He pulled out the\nround and looked it over. “If they really wanted money, they’d be robbing\ngold transports or banks. The robberies are probably a distraction. If you\nwant a man’s horses, sometimes the best thing to do is let his hogs loose.\nWhile he’s chasing them down, you ride off.\n“I’d lay money on these Vanishers being after something else, something\nunlikely. Perhaps an item that is easy to overlook in all that has been taken.\nOr maybe it’s really about extortion—and they plan to start asking for\nprotection money from people in town. See if anyone’s been contacted\nabout that. I haven’t, by the way.\n“If that goes nowhere, look at the hostages. One of them might have been\ncarrying something that was the real target of the robbery. I wouldn’t be\nsurprised if this turned out to be about clandestine blackmail.”\n“But they robbed a few trains before taking any hostages.”\n“Yes,” Waxillium said. “And they got away with it. There was no reason\nto expose themselves by robbing passengers if they could make off with\ncargo unseen and unstopped. They’re after something else, Wayne. Trust\nme.”\n“All right.” The wiry man rubbed his face, then finally pulled off the fake\nmustache. He stuffed it into his pocket. “But tell me. Don’t you even want\nto know? Doesn’t it itch at you?”\n“No.” That wasn’t completely true.\nWayne snorted. “I’d believe you if you could say that without your eye\ntwitching, mate.” He nodded toward the bullet. “I notice you didn’t offer to\ngive that back.”\n“I didn’t.” Waxillium pocketed it.\n“And you still wear your metalminds,” Wayne said, nodding to the\nbracers hidden mostly by the cuffs of Waxillium’s sleeves. “Not to mention\nthat you’re still keeping steel inside your sleeve. I noticed a gun catalogue\nover on the table, too.”\n“A man must have hobbies.”\n“If you say so,” Wayne said, then stepped forward, tapping Waxillium on\nthe chest. “But you know what I think? I think you’re looking for excuses to\nnot let go. This thing, it’s who you are. And no mansion, no marriage, and\nno mere title is going to change that.” Wayne tipped his hat. “You’re meant\nto be helping people, mate. It’s what you do.”\nWith that, Wayne left, his duster brushing against the doorframe as he\nwalked out.\n3\nEight hours later, Waxillium stood at an upper window of his mansion.

You’re not going to go\noutside anyway. Still, he wished the mists were out; he felt more at peace\nwhen they were out there, watching. The world became a different place,\none he felt he better understood.\nHe sighed and crossed his study to the wall. He turned the switch, and the\nelectric lights came on. They were still a wonder to him. Even though he\nknew the Words of Founding had given hints regarding electricity, what\nmen had achieved still seemed incredible.\nHe crossed the room to his uncle’s desk. His desk. Back in Weathering,\nWaxillium had used a rough, flimsy table. Now he had a sturdy, smoothly\npolished desk of stained oak. He sat down and began leafing through\nledgers of house finances. It wasn’t long, however, before his eyes started\nflicking toward the stack of broadsheets lying on his easy chair. He’d asked\nLimmi to go gather a few of them for him.\nHe usually ignored the broadsheets these days. Reports of crimes had a\nway of setting his mind running in circles and keeping him from focusing\non his business. Of course, now that thoughts of the Vanishers had been\nplanted in his mind, he’d have trouble letting go and doing anything\nproductive, at least until he had scratched a few itches about what they’d\nbeen doing.\nPerhaps just a little reading, he told himself. To catch up on current\nevents. It wouldn’t hurt to be informed; in fact, it might be important to his\nability to entertain discussions with others.\nWaxillium fetched the stack and returned to his desk. He easily found an\naccount of the robberies in the day’s paper. Other broadsheets in the stack\nhad even more information. He’d mentioned the Vanishers to Limmi, and so\nshe’d gathered a few broadsheets that were intended for people who wanted\na collection of all of the recent stories on them. These reprinted articles\nfrom weeks or even months ago, with the original dates of the stories’\npublication. Those types of broadsheets were popular, he could tell, as he\nhad three different ones from three different publishers. It seemed everyone\nwanted to stay up to date on items they’d missed.\nBy the dates listed on the reprinted articles, the first robbery had\nhappened much earlier than he’d assumed. Seven months ago, just before\nhe’d arrived back in Elendel. There had been a lapse of four months\nbetween the first railway cargo disappearance and the second. The name\n“Vanishers” hadn’t started being used until this second attack.\nThe robberies were all similar, save for the one at the playhouse. A train\nwas stopped because of a distraction on the tracks—early on, a fallen tree.\nLater, a ghostly phantom railcar that appeared from the mists, traveling\ndirectly at the train. The engineers stopped in a panic, but the phantom\nahead vanished.\nThe engineers would start their train again. When it reached its\ndestination, one of their cars was found to have been emptied of all goods.\nPeople were ascribing all kinds of mystical powers to the robbers, who\nseemed to be able to pass through walls and locked cargo cars without"

But what goods were stolen? Waxillium thought, frowning. The\nreports of the first theft didn’t say, though it did mention the cargo had\nbelonged to Augustin Tekiel.\nTekiel was one of the richest houses in the city, based over in the Second\nOctant, though it was building its new skyscraper in the financial district of\nthe Fourth Octant. Waxillium read the articles over again, then searched\nthrough the broadsheets, scanning them for any further mention of the first\nrobbery before the second occurred.\nWhat’s this? he thought, holding up a broadsheet that included a reprint\nof a letter Augustin Tekiel had written for publication a few months back.\nThe letter denounced the Elendel constables for failure to protect or recover\nTekiel’s goods. The broadsheet had happily printed it, even made a headline\nof it: “Constables Incompetent, Tekiel Slams.”\nThree months. It had taken three months for Tekiel to say anything.\nWaxillium put aside these compilation broadsheets, then searched through\nthe more recent broadsheets for other mentions. There was no shortage of\nthem; the robberies were dramatic and mysterious, two things that sold a lot\nof papers.\nThe second and third robberies had been of steel shipments. Odd, that.\nAn impractically heavy substance to take, and not as valuable as simply\nrobbing the passenger cars. The fourth robbery had been the one that caught\nWayne’s attention: packaged foodstuffs from a train on its way to the\nnorthern Roughs. The fifth robbery had been the first to involve the\npassengers. The sixth and seventh had done so as well, the seventh being\nthe only time the Vanishers had taken two hostages instead of one.\nAll three of the later robberies had involved stealing from a freight car as\nwell as from passengers. Metals in two cases, foodstuffs in another case—at\nleast, that was all the newspaper reported. With each case, the details had\ngrown more interesting, as the cargo cars had been better secured. More\nsophisticated locks, guards riding along. The robberies happened incredibly\nquickly, considering the weight of goods taken.\nDid they use a speed bubble, like Wayne makes? Waxillium thought. But\nno. You couldn’t move in or out of a speed bubble once one was up, and it\nwould be impossible to make one large enough to facilitate this kind of\nrobbery. So far as he knew, at least.\nWaxillium continued reading. There were a great many articles with\ntheories, quotes, and eyewitness reports. Many suggested a speed bubble,\nbut editorials cut those to shreds. Too much manpower would be needed,\nmore than could fit in a speed bubble. They thought it more likely that a\nFeruchemist who could increase his strength was lifting the heavy materials\nout of the cars and carrying them off.\nBut to where? And why? And how were they bypassing the locks and the\nguards? Waxillium cut out articles he found interesting.

Few had any solid\ninformation.\nA soft knock at the door interrupted him in the middle of spreading the\narticles out on his desk. He looked up to see Tillaume in the doorway\nholding a tray of tea and a basket, the handle over his arm. “Tea, my lord?”\n“That would be wonderful.”\nTillaume strode forward and set up a small stand beside the desk, getting\na cup and a sharp white napkin. “Do you have a preference?” Tillaume\ncould manufacture dozens of varieties of tea from the simplest of starting\npoints, blending and making what he considered ideal.\n“Whatever.”\n“My lord. There is great importance to tea. It should never merely be\n‘whatever.’ Tell me. Are you planning to sleep soon?”\nWaxillium looked over the array of cut-out reports. “Definitely not.”\n“Very well. Would you prefer something to help clear your mind?”\n“That might be nice.”\n“Sweet or not?”\n“Not.”\n“Minty or spicy?”\n“Minty.”\n“Strong or weak?”\n“Er … strong.”\n“Excellent,” Tillaume said, taking several jars and some silver spoons\nfrom his basket. He began mixing powders and bits of herbs into a cup.\n“My lord looks very intent.”\nWaxillium tapped the table. “My lord is annoyed. Broadsheets make for\nterrible research opportunities. I need to know what was in the first\nshipment.”\n“The first shipment, my lord?”\n“The first railcar that the thieves stole from.”\n“Miss Grimes would note that you seem to be slipping into old habits,\nmy lord.”\n“Miss Grimes isn’t here, fortunately. Besides, Lord Harms and his\ndaughter seemed aghast that I didn’t know about the robberies. I must keep\nabreast of events in the city.”\n“That’s a very excellent excuse, my lord.”\n“Thank you,” Waxillium said, taking the cup of tea. “I almost have\nmyself completely persuaded.” He took a sip. “Preservation’s Wings, man!\nThis is good.”\n“Thank you, my lord.” Tillaume took out the napkin and snapped it in his\nhands, then folded it down the middle and laid it across the arm of\nWaxillium’s chair. “And I believe that the first thing stolen was a shipment\nof wool. I heard it being discussed at the butcher’s earlier in the week.”\n“Wool. That makes no sense.”\n“None of these crimes make much sense, my lord.”\n“Yes,” Waxillium said. “Unfortunately, those are the most interesting\nkind of crimes.” He took another sip of the tea. The strong, minty scent\nseemed to clear his nose and mind. “I need paper.”\n“What—”\n“A large sheet,” Waxillium continued. “As big as you can find.”\n“I will see what is available, my lord,” Tillaume said. Waxillium caught a\nfaint sigh of exasperation from the man, though he left the room to do as\nasked.\nHow long had it been since Waxillium had started his research? He\nglanced at the clock, and was surprised at the time. Well into the night\nalready.\nWell, he was into it now. He’d never sleep until he’d worked it through."

He’d never sleep until he’d worked it through.\nHe rose and began to pace, holding his teacup and saucer before him. He\nstayed away from the windows. He was backlit, and would make an\nexcellent target for a sniper outside. Not that he really thought there would\nbe one, but … well, he felt more comfortable working this way.\nWool, he thought. He walked over and opened a ledger, looking up some\nfigures. He grew so absorbed that he didn’t notice the passing of time until\nTillaume returned.\n“Will this do, my lord?” he asked, bringing in an artist’s easel with a\nlarge pad of paper clipped to it. “The old Lord Ladrian kept this for your\nsister. She did love to draw.”\nWaxillium looked at it, and felt his heart clench. He hadn’t thought of\nTelsin in ages. They had been so distant most of their lives. Not by intent,\nlike his distance from his uncle; Waxillium and the previous Lord Ladrian\nhad often been at odds. No, his distance from Telsin had been one born\nmore of laziness. Twenty years apart, only seeing his sister occasionally,\nhad let him slide along without much contact.\nAnd then she’d died, in the same accident as his uncle. He wished the\nnews had been harder for him to hear. It should have been harder for him to\nhear. She’d been a stranger by then, though.\n“My lord?” the butler asked.\n“The paper is perfect,” Waxillium said, rising and fetching a pencil.\n“Thank you. I was worried we’d have to hang the paper on the wall.”\n“Hang it?”\n“Yes. I used to use some bits of tar.”\nThat idea seemed to make Tillaume very uncomfortable. Waxillium\nignored him, walking over and beginning to write on the pad. “This is nice\npaper.”\n“I’m pleased, my lord,” Tillaume said uncertainly.\nWaxillium drew a little train in the top left corner, putting in a track\nahead of it. He wrote a date beneath it. “First robbery. Fourteenth of\nVinuarch. Target: wool. Supposedly.” In like manner, he added more trains,\ntracks, dates, and details down the paper.\nWayne had always mocked him when he’d sketched out crimes to help\nhim think. But it worked, though he frequently had to put up with Wayne’s\nplayful additions of little stick-figure bandits or mistwraiths rampaging\nacross the otherwise neat and orderly sketchwork and notes.\n“Second robbery happened much later,” Waxillium continued. “Metals.\nFor the first robbery, Lord Tekiel didn’t make any kind of fuss until months\nhad passed.” He tapped the paper, then crossed out the word “wool.” “He\ndidn’t lose a shipment of wool. It was early summer then, and wool prices\nwould be too low to justify the freight charges. As I recall, the rates were\nunusually high in Vinuarch because the eighteenth railway line was out of\nservice. It would take a man with breadcrumbs for brains to pay a premium\nto ship out-of-season wares to people who didn’t want them.”\n“So…” Tillaume said."

It would take a man with breadcrumbs for brains to pay a premium\nto ship out-of-season wares to people who didn’t want them.”\n“So…” Tillaume said.\n“Just a moment,” Waxillium said. He walked over and pulled a few\nledgers off the shelf beside his desk. His uncle had some shipping manifests\nhere.…\nYes. The old Lord Ladrian had kept very good track of what his\ncompetitor houses had been shipping. Waxillium scanned the lists for\noddities. It took him a little while, but he eventually came up with a theory.\n“Aluminum,” Waxillium said. “Tekiel was probably shipping aluminum,\nbut avoiding taxes by claiming it as something else. In here, his stated\naluminum shipments for the last two years are much smaller than they were\nfor previous years. His smelters are still producing, however. I’d bet my\nbest gun that Augustin Tekiel—with the help of some railway workers—has\nbeen running a nice, profitable little smuggling operation. That’s why he\ndidn’t make a big commotion about the theft at first; he didn’t want to draw\nattention.”\nWaxillium walked over and wrote some notations on his paper. He lifted\nhis cup of tea to his lips, nodding to himself. “That also explains the long\nwait between the first and second robberies. The bandits were making use\nof that aluminum. They probably sold some of it on the black market to\nfund their operation, then used the rest to make aluminum bullets. But why\nwould they need aluminum bullets?”\n“For killing Allomancers?” Tillaume asked. He had been tidying the\nroom while Waxillium read the ledgers.\n“Yes.” Waxillium drew in images of faces above three of the robberies,\nthe ones where they’d taken hostages.\n“My lord?” Tillaume asked, stepping up beside him. “You think the\ncaptives are Allomancers?”\n“The names have all been released,” Waxillium said. “All four are\nwomen from wealthy families, but none of them openly have Allomantic\npowers.”\nTillaume remained quiet. That didn’t mean everything. Many\nAllomancers among the upper crust were discreet about their powers. There\nwere plenty of situations where that could be useful. For instance, if you\nwere a Rioter or Soother—capable of influencing people’s emotions—you\nwouldn’t want people to suspect.\nIn other cases, Allomancy was flaunted. A recent candidate for the\norchard-growers seat on the Senate had run solely on the platform that he\nwas a Coppercloud, and was therefore impossible to affect with zinc or\nbrass. The candidate won by a landslide. People hated thinking that\nsomeone might secretly be pulling their leaders’ strings.\nWaxillium started noting his speculations around the margins of the\npaper. Motives, possible ways they were emptying the freight cars so\nquickly, similarities and differences among the heists. As he wrote he\nhesitated, then added a couple of stick-figure bandits at the top, drawn in\nWayne’s sloppy style. Crazy though it was, he felt better having them there.\n“I’ll bet the captives were all Allomancers, secretly,” Waxillium said.\n“The thieves had aluminum bullets to deal with Coinshots, Lurchers, and\nThugs. And if we were able to catch any of the thieves, I’ll bet good money"

And if we were able to catch any of the thieves, I’ll bet good money\nthat we’d find them wearing aluminum linings in their hats to shield their\nemotions from being Pushed or Pulled on.” That wasn’t uncommon among\nthe city’s elite as well, though the common men couldn’t afford such luxury.\nThe robberies weren’t about money; they were about the captives. That\nwas why no bounty had been demanded, and why the bodies of the captives\nhadn’t been discovered dumped somewhere. The robberies were meant to\nobscure the true motives for the kidnappings. The victims were not the\nspur-of-the-moment hostages they were meant to appear. The Vanishers\nwere gathering Allomancers. And Allomantic metals—so far raw steel,\npewter, iron, zinc, brass, tin, and even some bendalloy had been stolen.\n“This is dangerous,” Waxillium whispered. “Very dangerous.”\n“My lord…” Tillaume said. “Weren’t you going to go over the house\naccount ledgers?”\n“Yes,” Waxillium said distractedly.\n“And the lease for the new offices in the Ironspine?”\n“I can still get to that tonight too.”\n“My lord.

Again, he was\nsurprised to see how much time had passed.\n“My lord,” Tillaume said. “Did I ever tell you about your uncle’s horse-\nracing days?”\n“Uncle Edwarn was a gambler?”\n“Indeed he was. It was a great problem to the house, soon after his rise to\nhigh lord. He would spend most of his days at the tracks.”\n“No wonder we’re destitute.”\n“Actually, he was quite good at the gambling, my lord. He usually came\nout ahead. Far ahead.”\n“Oh.”\n“He stopped anyway,” Tillaume said, collecting his tray and Waxillium’s\nempty teacup. “Unfortunately, my lord, while he was winning a small\nfortune at the races, the house lost a large fortune in mismanaged business\nand financial dealings.” He walked toward the door, but turned. His\nnormally somber face softened. “It is not my place to lecture, my lord. Once\none becomes a man, he can and must make his own decisions. But I do\noffer warning. Even a good thing can become destructive if taken to excess.\n“Your house needs you. Thousands of families rely upon you. They need\nyour leadership and your guidance. You did not ask for this, I understand.\nBut the mark of a great man is one who knows when to set aside the\nimportant things in order to accomplish the vital ones.”\nThe butler left, closing the door behind him.\nWaxillium stood alone beneath the uncannily steady glow of the electric\nlights, looking at his diagram. He tossed the pencil aside, suddenly feeling\ndrained, and fished out his pocket watch. It was two fifteen. He should be\ngetting some sleep. Normal people slept at these hours.\nHe dimmed the lights to not be backlit, then walked to the window. He\nwas still depressed not to see any mists, even though he hadn’t expected\nthem. I never said daily prayers, he realized. Things have been too chaotic\ntoday."

Things have been too chaotic\ntoday.\nWell, it was better to arrive late than not at all. He reached into his\npocket, fishing out his earring. It was a simple thing, stamped on the head\nwith the ten interlocking rings of the Path. He slipped it into his ear, which\nwas pierced for the purpose, and leaned against the window to stare out at\nthe darkened city.\nThere was no specific prescribed posture for praying as a Pathian. Just\nfifteen minutes of meditation and pondering. Some liked to sit with legs\ncrossed, eyes closed, but Waxillium had always found it harder to think in\nthat posture. It made his back hurt and his spine tingle. What if someone\nsneaked around behind him and shot him in the back?\nSo, he just stood. And pondered. How are things up there in the mists? he\nthought. He was never sure how to talk to Harmony. Life’s good, I assume?\nWhat with you being God, and all?\nIn response, he felt a sense of … amusement. He could never tell if he\ncreated those sensations himself or not.\nWell, since I’m not God myself, Waxillium thought, perhaps you could\nuse that omniscience of yours to drum up some answers for me. It feels like\nI’m in a bind.\nA discordant thought. This wasn’t like most of the binds he’d been in. He\nwasn’t tied up, about to be murdered. He wasn’t lost in the Roughs, without\nwater or food, trying to find his way back to civilization. He was standing in\na lavish mansion, and while his family was having financial troubles, it was\nnothing they couldn’t weather. He had a life of luxury and a seat on the city\nSenate.\nWhy, then, did he feel like these last six months had been among the\nhardest he’d ever lived? An endless series of reports, ledgers, dinner parties,\nand business deals.\nThe butler was right; many did rely on him. The Ladrian house had\nstarted as several thousand individuals following the Origin, and had grown\nlarge in three hundred years, adopting under its protection any who came to\nwork on its properties or in its foundries. The deals Waxillium negotiated\ndetermined their wages, their privileges, their lifestyle. If his house\ncollapsed, they’d find employment elsewhere, but would be considered\nlesser members of those houses for a generation or two until they obtained\nfull rights.\nI’ve done hard things before, he thought. I can do this one. If it’s right. Is\nit right?\nSteris had called the Path a simple religion. Perhaps it was. There was\nonly one basic tenet: Do more good than harm. There were other aspects—\nthe belief that all truth was important, the requirement to give more than\none took. There were over three hundred examples listed in the Words of\nFounding, religions that could have been. Might have been. In other times,\nin another world.\nThe Path was to study them, learn from their moral codes. A few rules\nwere central. Do not seek lust without commitment. See the strengths in all\nflaws. Pray and meditate fifteen minutes a day. And don’t waste time\nworshipping Harmony. Doing good was the worship."

Doing good was the worship.\nWaxillium had been converted to the Path soon after leaving Elendel. He\nwas still convinced that the woman he’d met on that train ride must have\nbeen one of the Faceless Immortals, the hands of Harmony. She’d given\nhim his earring; every Pathian wore one while praying.\nThe problem was, it was hard for Waxillium to feel like he was doing\nanything useful. Luncheons and ledgers, contracts and negotiations. He\nknew, logically, that all of it was important. But those, even his vote on the\nSenate, were all abstractions. No match for seeing a murderer jailed or a\nkidnapped child rescued. In his youth, he’d lived in the City—the world’s\ncenter of culture, science, and progress—for two decades, but he hadn’t\nfound himself until he’d left it and wandered the dusty, infertile lands out\nbeyond the mountains.\nUse your talents, something seemed to whisper inside of him. You’ll\nfigure it out.\nThat made him smile ruefully. He couldn’t help wondering why, if\nHarmony really was listening, he didn’t give more specific answers. Often,\nall Waxillium got from prayer was a sense of encouragement. Keep going.\nIt’s not as difficult as you feel it is. Don’t give up.\nHe sighed, just closing his eyes, losing himself in thought. Other\nreligions had their ceremonies and their meetings. Not the Pathians. In a\nway, its very simplicity made the Path much harder to follow. It left\ninterpretation up to one’s own conscience.\nAfter meditating for a time, he couldn’t help feeling that Harmony\nwanted him to study the Vanishers and to be a good house lord. Were the\ntwo mutually exclusive? Tillaume thought they were.\nWaxillium glanced back at the stack of broadsheets and the easel with the\ndrawing pad on it. He reached into his pocket, taking out the bullet Wayne\nhad left.\nAnd against his will, he saw in his mind’s eye Lessie, head jerking back,\nblood spraying into the air. Blood covering her beautiful brown hair. Blood\non the floor, on the walls, on the murderer who had been standing behind\nher. But that murderer hadn’t been the one to shoot her.\nOh, Harmony, he thought, raising a hand to his head and slowly sitting\ndown, back to the wall. It really is about her, isn’t it? I can’t do that again.\nNot again.\nHe dropped the round, pulled off his earring. He stood, walked over,\ncleaned up the broadsheets, and closed the drawing pad. Nobody had been\nhurt by the Vanishers yet. They were robbing people, but they weren’t\nharming them. There wasn’t even proof that the hostages were in danger.\nLikely they’d be returned after ransom demands were met.\nWaxillium sat down to work on his house’s ledgers instead. He let them\ndraw his attention well into the night.\n4\n“Harmony’s forearms,” Waxillium mumbled, stepping into the grand\nballroom. “This is what passes for a modest wedding dinner these days?"

Now it was filled. Rows and rows\nof tables lined the hardwood floor of the cavernous chamber; there had to be\nover a hundred of them. Ladies, lords, elected officials, and the wealthy\nelite moved and chatted in a low hum, all dressed in their finest. Sparkling\njewels. Crisp black suits with colorful cravats. Women with dresses after the\nmodern fashion: deep colors, skirts that went down to the floor, thick outer\nlayers with lots of folds and lace. Most women wore tight, vestlike coats\nover the top, and the necklines were much lower now than he remembered\nthem being in his childhood. Perhaps he was simply more likely to notice.\n“What was that, Waxillium?” Steris asked, turning to the side and letting\nhim help off her overcoat. She wore a fine red dress that seemed\ncalculatedly designed to be completely in fashion but not too daring.\n“I was simply noting the size of this gathering, my dear,” Waxillium said,\nfolding her coat and handing it—along with his bowler hat—to a waiting\nattendant. “I’ve been to quite a number of functions since my return to the\ncity, and none were this enormous. Practically half the city seems to have\nbeen invited.”\n“Well, this is something special,” she said. “A wedding involving two\nvery well-connected houses. They wouldn’t want to leave anyone out.\nExcept, of course, the ones they left out on purpose.”\nSteris held out her arm for him to take. He’d received a detailed lecture\nduring the carriage ride on how, precisely, he was to hold it. His arm above\nhers, taking her hand lightly, fingers wrapping down under her palm. It\nlooked horribly unnatural, but she insisted that it would convey the exact\nmeaning they intended. Indeed, as they stepped down onto the ballroom\nfloor, they drew a number of interested looks.\n“You imply,” Waxillium said, “that one purpose of this wedding dinner is\nnot in who is invited, but who is not.”\n“Precisely,” she said. “And, in order to fulfill that purpose, everybody\nelse must be invited. The Yomens are powerful, even if they do believe in\nSliverism. Horrid religion. Imagine, revering Ironeyes himself. Anyway,\nnobody will ignore an invitation to this celebration. And so, those to be\nslighted will not only find themselves without a party to attend, but unable\nto arrange their own diversions, as anyone they might have wanted to invite\nwill be here. That leaves them to either associate with other uninviteds—\ntherefore reinforcing their outcast status—or to sit alone at home, thinking\nabout how they have been insulted.”\n“In my experience,” Waxillium said, “that sort of unhappy brooding leads\nto a high probability of people getting shot.”\nShe smiled, waving with calculated fondness to someone they passed."

It is the City. We don’t do such things\nhere.”\n“No, you don’t. Shooting people would be too charitable for City folks.”\n“You haven’t even seen the worst of it,” she noted, waving to someone\nelse. “You see that person turned away from us? The stocky man with the\nlonger hair?”\n“Yes.”\n“Lord Shewrman. An infamously dreadful party guest. He’s a complete\nbore when not drunk and a complete buffoon when he is drunk—which is\nmost of the time, I might add. He is probably the least likable person in all\nof upper society. Most people here would rather spend an hour amputating\none of their own toes than spend a few moments chatting with him.”\n“So why is he here?”\n“For the insult factor, Waxillium. Those who were snubbed will be even\nmore aghast to learn that Shewrman was here. By including a few bad\nalloys like him—men and women who are utterly undesirable, but who\ndon’t realize it—House Yomen is essentially saying, ‘We’d even prefer\nspending time with these people to spending it with you.’ Very effective.\nVery nasty.”\nWaxillium snorted. “If you tried something that rude out in Weathering, it\nwould end with you strung up by your heels from the rafters. If you’re\nlucky.”\n“Hum. Yes.” A servant stepped forward, gesturing for them to follow as\nshe led them to a table. “You understand,” Steris continued more softly,\n“that I am no longer responding to your ‘ignorant frontiersman’ act,\nWaxillium.”\n“Act?”\n“Yes,” she said distractedly. “You are a man. The prospect of marriage\nmakes men uncomfortable, and they clutch for freedom. Therefore, you\nhave begun regressing, tossing out savage comments to provoke a reaction\nfrom me. This is your instinct for masculine independence; an exaggeration\nmeant, unconsciously, to undermine the wedding.”\n“You assume it’s an exaggeration, Steris,” Waxillium said as they\napproached the table. “Maybe this is what I am.”\n“You are what you choose to be, Waxillium,” she said. “As for these\npeople here, and choices made by House Yomen, I did not make these rules.\nNor do I approve of them; many are inconvenient. But it is the society in\nwhich we live. Therefore, I make of myself something that can survive in\nthis environment.”\nWaxillium frowned as she released his arm and fondly kissed cheeks with\na few women from a nearby table—distant relatives, it seemed. He found\nhimself clasping hands behind his back and nodding with a civil smile to\nthose who came to greet Steris and him.\nHe’d made a good showing for himself these last months while moving\namong upper society, and people treated him far more amiably than they\nonce had. He was even fond of some of those who approached. However,\nthe nature of what he was doing with Steris still made him uncomfortable,\nand he found it difficult to enjoy much of the conversation."

However,\nthe nature of what he was doing with Steris still made him uncomfortable,\nand he found it difficult to enjoy much of the conversation.\nIn addition, this many people in one place still made his back itch. Too\nmuch confusion, too difficult to watch the exits. He preferred the smaller\nparties, or at least the ones spread across a large number of rooms.\nThe bride and groom arrived, and people rose to clap. Lord Joshin and\nLady Mi’chelle; Waxillium didn’t know them, though he did wonder why\nthey were speaking with a scruffy man who looked like a beggar, dressed\nall in black. Fortunately, it didn’t seem Steris intended to drag him over to\nwait with those intent upon congratulating the newlyweds at the earliest\npossible moment.\nSoon, the first tables were served their meals. Silverware began to clatter.\nSteris sent for a servant to prepare their table; Waxillium passed the time by\ninspecting the room. There were two balconies, one at each shorter end of\nthe rectangular ballroom. There appeared to be space for dining up there,\nthough no tables had been set up. They were being used for musicians\ntoday, a group of harpists.\nMajestic chandeliers hung from the ceiling—six enormous ones down the\ncenter, outfitted with thousands of sparkling pieces of crystal. Twelve\nsmaller ones hung at their sides. Electric lights, he noted. Those chandeliers\nmust have been a horrible pain to light before the conversion.\nThe sheer cost of a party like this numbed his senses. He could have fed\nWeathering for a year on what was being spent for this single evening. His\nuncle had sold the Ladrian ballroom a few years back—it had been a\nseparate building, in a different neighborhood from the mansion. That made\nWaxillium happy; from what he remembered, it had been as large as this\none. If they’d still owned it, people might have expected him to throw\nlavish parties like this.\n“Well?” Steris asked, holding out her arm for him again as the servant\nreturned to lead them to their table. He could see Lord Harms and Steris’s\ncousin Marasi sitting at the table already.\n“I’m remembering why I left the City,” Waxillium said honestly. “Life is\nso damn hard here.”\n“Many would say that of the Roughs.”\n“And few of them have lived in both,” Waxillium said. “Living here is a\ndifferent kind of hard, but it’s still hard. Marasi is joining us again?”\n“Indeed.”\n“What is going on with her, Steris?”\n“She’s from the Outer Estates and badly wanted the chance to attend\nuniversity here in the City. My father took pity on her, as her own parents\nhaven’t the means to support her. He is allowing her to reside with us for\nthe duration of her studies.”\nA valid explanation, though it seemed to roll out of Steris’s mouth far too\nquickly. Was it a practiced excuse, or was Waxillium assuming too much?\nEither way, further discussion was interrupted as Lord Harms rose to greet\nhis daughter.\nWaxillium shook hands with Lord Harms, took Marasi’s hand and\nbowed, then sat.

Steris began speaking with her father about the people\nshe’d noted to be attending or absent, and Waxillium rested elbows on the\ntable, listening with half an ear.\nHard room to defend, he thought absently. Snipers on those balconies\nwould work, but you’d need some on each one, watching to make sure\nnobody gets beneath the other. Anyone with a strong enough gun—or the\nright Allomantic powers—could take out snipers from below. The pillars\nbelow the balconies would also be good shelter, though.\nThe more cover there was, the better the situation for the one who was\noutnumbered. Not that you ever wanted to be outnumbered, but he’d rarely\nbeen in any fight where he wasn’t. So he looked for cover. In the open, a\ngunfight came down to who could field the most men with weapons. But\nonce you could hide, skill and experience started to compensate. Maybe this\nroom wouldn’t be too bad a place to fight after all. He—\nHe hesitated. What was he doing? He’d made his decision. Did he have\nto keep remaking it every few days?\n“Marasi,” he said, forcing himself into conversation. “Your cousin tells\nme you’ve entered into university studies?”\n“I’m in my final year,” she said.\nHe waited for a further reply, and didn’t get one.\n“And how go your studies?”\n“Well,” she said, and looked down, holding her napkin.\nThat was productive, he thought with a sigh. Fortunately, it looked like a\nserver was approaching. The lean man began pouring wine for them. “The\nsoup will be along presently,” he explained with a faint Terris accent, lofty\nvowels, and a slightly nasal tone.\nThe voice froze Waxillium stiff.\n“Today’s soup,” the server continued, “is a delightfully seasoned prawn\nbisque with a hint of pepper. You shall find it quite enjoyable, I think.” He\nglanced at Waxillium, eyes twinkling in amusement. Though he wore a\nfalse nose and a wig, those were Wayne’s eyes.\nWaxillium groaned softly.\n“My lord doesn’t like prawns?” Wayne asked with horror.\n“The bisque is quite good,” Lord Harms said. “I’ve had it at a Yomen\nparty before.”\n“It’s not the soup,” Waxillium said. “I’ve just recalled something I forgot\nto do.” It involves strangling someone.\n“I shall return shortly with your soup, my lords and ladies,” Wayne\npromised. He even had a fake line of Terris earrings in his ears. Of course,\nWayne was part Terris, as was Waxillium himself—as evidenced by their\nFeruchemical abilities. That was rare in the population; though nearly a fifth\nof the Originators had been Terris, they weren’t prone to marrying other\nethnicities.\n“Does that server look familiar?” Marasi asked, turning and watching\nhim go.\n“He must have served us last time we were here,” Lord Harms said.\n“But I wasn’t with you last—”\n“Lord Harms,” Waxillium jumped in, “has anything been heard of your\nrelative? The one who was kidnapped by the Vanishers?”"

The one who was kidnapped by the Vanishers?”\n“No,” he said, taking a sip of his wine. “Ruin those thieves. This kind of\nthing is absolutely unacceptable. They should confine such behavior to the\nRoughs!”\n“Yes,” Steris said, “it does somewhat undermine one’s respect for the\nconstabulary when things like this occur. And the robbery inside the city!\nHow terrible.”\n“What was it like?” Marasi suddenly asked. “Lord Ladrian? Living\nwhere there was no law?” She seemed genuinely curious, though her\ncomment earned a glare from Lord Harms, likely for bringing up\nWaxillium’s past.\n“It was difficult sometimes,” Waxillium admitted. “Out there, some\npeople just believe they can take what they want. It would actually surprise\nthem when someone stood up to them. As if I were some spoiler, the only\none who didn’t understand the game they were all playing.”\n“Game?” Lord Harms said, frowning.\n“A figure of speech, Lord Harms,” Waxillium said. “You see, they all\nseemed to think that if you were skilled or well armed, you could take\nwhatever you want. I was both, and yet instead of taking, I stopped them.\nThey found it baffling.”\n“It was very brave of you,” Marasi said.\nHe shrugged. “It wasn’t bravery, honestly. I just kind of fell into things.”\n“Even stopping the Surefires?”\n“They were a special case. I—” He froze. “How did you know about\nthat?”\n“Reports trickle in,” Marasi said, blushing. “From the Roughs. Most of\nthem get written up by someone. You can find them at the university or at\nthe right bookshop.”\n“Oh.” Uncomfortable, he picked up his cup and drank some wine.\nAs he did, something slipped into his mouth. He nearly spat out the entire\nmouthful in surprise. He contained himself. Barely.\nWayne, I really am going to throttle you. He moved the object into his\nhand, covering the act with a cough.\n“Well,” Steris said, “hopefully the constables will soon deal with these\nruffians and we can return to peace and law.”\n“Actually,” Marasi said, “I don’t think that’s likely.”\n“Child,” Lord Harms said sternly. “That’s quite enough.”\n“I’d like to hear what she has to say, my lord,” Waxillium said. “For the\nsake of conversation.”\n“Well … all right … I suppose.”\n“It’s simply a theory I had,” Marasi said, blushing. “Lord Ladrian, when\nyou were lawkeeper in Weathering, what was the population of the city?”\nHe fingered the item in his hand. A spent bullet casing that had been\ncapped with a dab of wax. “Well, it started to grow rapidly in the last few\nyears. But for most of the time, I’d say it was around fifteen hundred.”\n“And the surrounding area?” she asked. “All the places you’d patrol, but\ndidn’t have their own lawkeepers?”\n“Maybe three thousand total,” Waxillium said. “Depending.

There are a\nlot of transients out in the Roughs. People looking to find a mineral claim or\nto start up a farmstead. Workers moving from place to place.”\n“Let’s say three thousand,” Marasi said. “And how many of you were\nthere? Those who helped you keep the law?”\n“Five or six, depending,” he said. “Wayne and I, and Barl most of the\ntime. A few others on and off.”\nAnd Lessie, he thought.\n“Let’s say six per three thousand,” she said. “Gives us an easy number to\nwork with. One lawman per five hundred people.”\n“What is the point of this?” Lord Harms asked sufferingly.\n“The population of our octant is around six hundred thousand,” she\nexplained. “By the same ratio Lord Ladrian described, we should have\nroughly twelve hundred constables. But we don’t. It’s somewhere closer to\nsix hundred, last I looked over the numbers. So, Lord Ladrian, your\n‘savage’ wildlands actually had double the number of lawmen watching\nover it as we have here in the city.”\n“Huh,” he said. Odd information for a young woman of means to have.\n“I’m not trying to diminish your accomplishments,” she said quickly.\n“You more likely had a higher percentage of lawbreakers as well, since the\nreputation of the Roughs draws that type. But I think it’s a matter of\nperception. As you said, out of the city, people expect to get away with their\ncrimes.\n“Here, they are more circumspect—and many of the crimes are smaller\nin scope. Instead of the bank getting robbed, you get a dozen people being\nrobbed on their way home at night. The nature of the urban environment\nmakes it easier to hide if you keep your crimes below a certain level of\nvisibility. But I wouldn’t say life is really safer in the city, despite what\npeople think.\n“I’ll bet more people are murdered here, by percentage of the population,\nthan out in the Roughs. There is so much more going on in the City,\nhowever, that people pay less attention to it. By contrast, when a man is\nmurdered in a small town, it’s a very disruptive event—even if it’s the only\nmurder that’s happened in years.\n“And all of this isn’t even counting the fact that much of the wealth in the\nworld is concentrated in a few places inside the city. Wealth draws men\nlooking for opportunity. There are a whole host of reasons why the City is\nmore dangerous than the Roughs. It’s just that we pretend that it isn’t.”\nWaxillium folded his arms in front of him on the table. Curious. Once\nshe started talking, she didn’t seem shy at all.\n“You see, my lord,” Harms said. “This is why I tried to still her.”\n“It would have been a shame if you had,” Waxillium said, “as I believe\nthat’s the most interesting thing anyone has said to me since I returned to\nElendel.”\nMarasi smiled, though Steris just rolled her eyes.

Unfortunately, the area right around them was crowded—Wayne\nwouldn’t be able to create a speed bubble around just Waxillium and\nhimself. It would catch someone else, and anyone caught in it would have\ntime sped up for them as well. Wayne couldn’t shape the bubble or choose\nwhom it affected.\nWhile the others were distracted by the soup, Waxillium broke the wax\noff the sealed shell casing and found a small rolled-up piece of paper inside.\nHe glanced at Wayne, then unrolled it.\nYou were right, it read.\n“I usually am,” he muttered as Wayne placed a bowl in front of him.\n“What are you up to, Wayne?”\n“One seventy, thank you,” Wayne said under his breath. “I’ve been lifting\nweights and eating steak.”\nWaxillium gave him a flat stare, but got ignored as Wayne proceeded to\nexplain—with his slight Terris accent—that he’d soon return with a bread\nbasket and more wine for the group.\n“Lord Ladrian,” Steris said as they began eating, “I suggest that we begin\ncompiling a list of conversational topics we can employ when in the\ncompany of others. The topics should not touch on politics or religion, yet\nshould be memorable and give us opportunities to appear charming. Do you\nknow any particularly witty sayings or stories that can be our starting\npoint?”\n“I once shot the tail off a dog by mistake,” Waxillium said idly. “It’s kind\nof a funny story.”\n“Shooting dogs is hardly appropriate dinner conversation,” Steris said.\n“I know. Particularly since I was aiming for its balls.”\nMarasi just about spat her soup across the table.\n“Lord Ladrian!” Steris exclaimed, though her father seemed amused.\n“I thought you said I couldn’t shock you any longer,” he said to Steris. “I\nwas merely testing your hypothesis, my dear.”\n“Honestly. You will eventually overcome this rural lack of decorum,\nwon’t you?”\nHe stirred his soup to make sure Wayne hadn’t hidden anything in it. I\nhope he at least washed that bullet casing. “I suspect that I will, indeed,\neventually overcome it,” he said, raising the spoon to his lips. The soup was\ngood, but too cold. “The amusing thing is that when I was in the Roughs, I\nwas considered to be highly refined—so much so, in fact, that they thought\nme haughty.”\n“Calling a man ‘refined’ by Roughs standards,” Lord Harms said, raising\na finger, “is like saying a brick is ‘soft’ by building-material standards—\nright before you smash it into a man’s face.”\n“Father!” Steris said. She glared at Waxillium, as if the comment were\nhis fault.\n“It was a perfectly legitimate simile,” Lord Harms said.\n“We will have no further talk of hitting people with bricks or of\nshootings, regardless of the target!”\n“Very well, cousin,” Marasi said. “Lord Ladrian, I once heard that you\nthrew a man’s own knife at him and hit him right through the eye.

I was aiming for the balls that time too.”\n“Lord Ladrian!” Steris said, nearly livid.\n“I know. That’s quite off target. I’ve got really bad aim with throwing\nknives.”\nSteris looked at them, growing red as she saw that her father was\nsnickering, but trying to cover it up with his napkin. Marasi met her gaze\nwith innocent equanimity. “No bricks,” Marasi said, “and no guns. I was\nmaking conversation as you requested.”\nSteris stood. “I’m going to see myself to the women’s washroom while\nyou three compose yourselves.”\nShe stalked away, and Waxillium felt a stab of guilt. Steris was stiff, but\nshe seemed earnest and honest. She did not deserve mockery. It was very\nhard not to try provoking her, however.\nLord Harms cleared his throat. “That was uncalled for, child,” he said to\nMarasi. “You must not make me regret my promise to start bringing you to\nthese functions.”\n“Don’t blame her, my lord,” Waxillium said. “I was the primary offender.\nI’ll offer a suitable apology to Steris when she returns, and will guard my\ntongue for the rest of the evening. I shouldn’t have allowed myself to go so\nfar.”\nHarms nodded, sighing. “I’ll admit, I’ve been tempted to such lengths\nmyself a time or two. She’s much as her mother was.” He gave Waxillium a\npitying look.\n“I see.”\n“This is our lot, son,” Lord Harms said, standing. “To be lord of a house\nrequires certain sacrifices. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I see Lord Alernath\nover at the bar and I think I’ll grab a nip of something harder with him\nbefore the main course. If I don’t go before Steris gets back, she’ll bully me\ninto staying. I shouldn’t be long.” He nodded to the two of them, then\nwaddled toward a group of higher-built tables off to the side, next to an\nopen bar.\nWaxillium watched him go, idly thinking and rolling Wayne’s note in his\nfingers. Previously, he’d assumed Lord Harms had driven Steris to be as she\nwas, but it appeared he was more under her thumb than vice versa. Another\ncuriosity, he thought.\n“Thank you for your defense of me, Lord Ladrian,” Marasi said. “It\nappears that you are as quick to come to a lady’s aid with words as you are\nwith pistols.”\n“I was merely stating the truth as I saw it, my lady.”\n“Tell me. Did you really shoot off a dog’s tail when aiming for his …\ner…”\n“Yes,” Waxillium said, grimacing. “In my defense, the damn thing was\nattacking me. Belonged to a man I hunted down. The aggressiveness wasn’t\nthe dog’s fault; the poor thing looked like it hadn’t been fed in days. I was\ntrying to shoot it somewhere nonlethal, scare it off. That part about the man"

That part about the man\nI hit in the eye was fabricated, though. I wasn’t actually aiming for any\nbody part in particular—I was just hoping I’d hit.”\nShe smiled. “Might I ask you something?”\n“Please.”\n“You looked crestfallen when I spoke of the statistics dealing with\nlawman ratios. I didn’t mean to offend or downplay your heroics.”\n“It’s all right,” he said.\n“But?”\nHe shook his head. “I’m not sure if I can explain it. When I found my\nway out to the Roughs, when I started bringing in the warranted, I started\nto … Well, I thought I’d found a place where I was needed. I thought I’d\nfound a way to do something that nobody else would do.”\n“But you did.”\n“And yet,” he said, stirring his soup, “it appears that all along, the place I\nleft behind might have needed me even more. I’d never noticed.”\n“You did important work, Lord Ladrian. Vital work. Besides, I\nunderstand that before you arrived, nobody was upholding the law in that\narea.”\n“There was Arbitan,” he said, smiling, remembering the older man.\n“And, of course, the lawkeepers over in Far Dorest.”\n“A distant city and with a short reach,” she said, “which had a single\ncapable lawman to serve a large population. Jon Deadfinger had his own\nproblems. By the time you had built things up, Weathering was protected\nbetter than those in the City—but it did not start that way.”\nHe nodded, though—again—he was curious about how much she knew.\nWere people really telling stories about him and Wayne all the way over\nhere in the city? Why hadn’t he heard of them before now?\nHer statistics did bother him. He hadn’t thought of the City as dangerous.\nIt was the Roughs, wild and untamed, that needed rescuing. The City was\nthe land of plenty that Harmony had created to shelter mankind. Here, trees\ngrew fruit in abundance and cultivated lands had water without need for\nirrigation. The ground was always fertile, and somehow never got farmed\nout.\nThis land was supposed to be different. Protected. He’d put away his\nguns in part because he’d convinced himself that the constables could do\ntheir jobs without help. But don’t the Vanishers prove that might not be the\ncase?\nWayne returned with the bread and a bottle of wine, then stopped,\nlooking at the two empty seats. “Oh dear,” he said. “Did you grow so tired\nof waiting that you devoured your two companions?”\nMarasi glanced at him and smiled.\nShe knows, Waxillium realized. She recognizes him.\n“If I may note something, my lady,” Waxillium said, drawing her\nattention back. “You are far less unassuming than you were at our first\nmeeting.”\nShe winced. “I’m not very good at being shy, am I?”\n“I wasn’t aware it was something that required practice.”\n“I try all the time,” Wayne said, sitting down at the table and taking the\nbaguette out of his basket.

This stuff is far worse than I was telling you guys. Sorry ’bout that.”\n“It will reflect in my tip,” Waxillium said dryly. “Lady Marasi, I was\nserious in my inquiry. To be frank, it seems that you’ve been trying to act\nwith exaggerated timidity.”\n“Always looking down after you speak,” Wayne agreed. “Raising the\npitch of your tone a little too much with questions.”\n“Not the type to be studying at the university at her own request,”\nWaxillium noted. “Why the act?”\n“I’d rather not say.”\n“You’d rather not,” Waxillium said, “or Lord Harms and his daughter\nwould rather you not?”\nShe blushed. “The latter. But please. I would really prefer to leave the\ntopic.”\n“Ever charming, Wax,” Wayne said, taking another bite from the loaf of\nbread. “See that? You’ve pushed the lady almost to tears.”\n“I’m not—” Marasi began.\n“Ignore him,” Waxillium said. “Trust me. He’s like a rash. The more you\nscratch him, the more irritating he gets.”\n“Ouch,” Wayne said, though he grinned.\n“Aren’t you worried?” Marasi asked softly of Wayne. “You’re wearing a\nwaiter’s uniform. If they see you sitting at the table and eating…”\n“Oh, that’s a good point,” Wayne said, tipping his chair back. The person\nbehind him had left, and with Lord Harms gone, Wayne had just enough\nroom to—\n—and there it was. He leaned his chair forward again, clothing changed\nback to a duster with a loose button-down shirt and thick Roughs trousers\nunderneath. He spun his hat on his finger. The earrings were gone.\nMarasi jumped. “Speed bubble,” she whispered, sounding awed. “I\nthought I’d be able to see something from outside!”\n“You could, if you were watching closely,” Waxillium said. “A blur. If\nyou look at the next table over, the sleeve of his waiter’s coat is sticking out\nfrom where he tossed it. His hat folds—though the sides are stiff, you can\ncompress it between your hands. I’m still trying to figure out where he had\nthe duster.”\n“Under your table,” Wayne said, sounding very self-satisfied.\n“Ah, of course,” Waxillium said. “He had to know beforehand which\ntable would be ours so he could be assigned as our waiter.” I really should\nhave looked under the table before we sat, Waxillium thought.

He didn’t feel paranoid; he didn’t lie awake at\nnights, worried that he’d be shot, or think that conspiracies were trying to\ndestroy him. He just liked to be careful.\nMarasi was still looking at Wayne; she seemed bemused.\n“We aren’t what you expected,” Waxillium said. “From the reports you\nread?”\n“No,” she admitted. “The accounts usually omitted matters of\npersonality.”\n“There are stories ’bout us?” Wayne asked.\n“Yes. Many.”\n“Damn.” He sounded impressed. “Do we get royalties for them or\nsomething? If we do, I want Wax’s share, seeing as to how I did all the stuff\nthey say he did. Plus he’s already rich and all.”\n“They are news-style reports,” Marasi said. “Those don’t pay royalties to\ntheir subjects.”\n“Filthy cheats.” Wayne paused. “I wonder if any of the other fine ladies\nin this establishment have heard of my outrageously heroic and masculine\nexploits.…”\n“Lady Marasi is a student at the university,” Waxillium said. “I’m\nassuming she read reports that are collected there. Most of the public won’t\nbe familiar with them.”\n“That is true,” she said.\n“Oh,” Wayne said, sounding disappointed. “Well, maybe Lady Marasi\nherself might be interested in hearing more of my outrageously—”\n“Wayne?”\n“Yes.”\n“Enough.”\n“Right.”\n“I do apologize for him,” Waxillium said, turning to Marasi. She still\nwore the bemused expression on her face.\n“He does that a lot,” Wayne said. “Apologizing. I think it’s one of his\npersonal failings. I try to help him out by being damn near perfect, but so\nfar, that hasn’t been enough.”\n“It’s quite all right,” she said. “I do wonder if I should write something\nfor my professors describing how … unique it was to meet you two.”\n“What is it, exactly, that you are studying at the university?” Waxillium\nasked.\nShe hesitated, then blushed deeply.\n“Ah, see!” Wayne said. “Now, that’s how to act shy. You’re getting much\nbetter! Bravo.”\n“It’s just that…” She raised a hand to shade her eyes and looked down in\nembarrassment. “It’s just … Oh, all right.

Wax only eats people on\nthe weekend.”\n“Both will likely be returning soon, Wayne,” Waxillium said. “So if you\nhad a purpose to your visit, you may wish to be on with it. Unless this is\njust normal, run-of-the-mill tormenting.”\n“I told you what it was about,” Wayne said. “You didn’t accidentally eat\nmy note, did you?”\n“No. It didn’t say much.”\n“It said enough,” Wayne said, leaning in. “Wax, you told me to look at\nthe hostages. You were right.”\n“They’re all Allomancers,” Waxillium guessed.\n“More than that,” Wayne said. “They’re all relatives.”\n“It’s only been three hundred years since the Originators, Wayne. We’re\nall relatives.”\n“Does that mean you’ll take responsibility for me?”\n“No.”\nWayne chuckled, pulling a folded piece of paper from his duster pocket.\n“It’s more than that, Wax. Look. Each of the women kidnapped was from a\nparticular line. I did some researchin’. Real, serious stuff.” He paused.\n“Why do they call it research if I’ve only done it this one time?”\n“Because I’ll bet you had to look things up twice,” Waxillium said,\ntaking the paper and studying it. It was written awkwardly, but was\ndecipherable. It explained the basic lines of descent of each of the women\nkidnapped.\nSeveral things stood out. Each of them could trace back to the Lord\nMistborn himself. Because of that, most of them also had a strong heritage\nof Allomancy in their past. They were all fairly closely related, third or\nfourth cousins, some first.\nWaxillium looked up, and noticed Marasi smiling broadly, regarding him\nand Wayne.\n“What?” Waxillium asked.\n“I knew it!” she exclaimed. “I knew you were in town to investigate the\nVanishers. You showed up to become house lord only one month after the\nfirst robbery happened. You’re going to catch them, aren’t you?”\n“Is that why you insisted that Lord Harms bring you to meetings with\nme?”\n“Maybe.”\n“Marasi,” Waxillium said, sighing. “You’re jumping to conclusions. Do\nyou think the deaths in my family, making me house lord, were\nfabrications?”\n“Well, no,” she said. “But I was surprised that you’d accepted the title\nuntil I realized that you probably saw it as a chance to find out what is\ngoing on with these robberies. You have to admit, they are unusual.”\n“So is Wayne,” Waxillium said. “But I wouldn’t uproot myself, change\nmy entire lifestyle, and accept responsibility for an entire house just to\nstudy him.”\n“Look, Wax,” Wayne jumped in—ignoring the barb, which was unusual\nfor him. “Please tell me you brought a gun with you.”\n“What? No, I didn’t.” Waxillium folded up the paper and handed it back.\n“Why would you care?”\n“Because,” Wayne said, snatching the paper from his hand and leaning\nin. “Don’t you see?

The thieves are looking for places they can rob where\nthe wealthy upper class of Elendel can be found—because among those\nwealthy upper-class types, they find their targets. People with the right\nheritage. Those types, rich types, have stopped traveling on the railway.”\nWaxillium nodded. “Yes, if the women really are the true targets, the\nhigh-profile robberies will make potential future targets much less likely to\ntravel. A valid connection. That must be why the thieves attacked the\ntheater.”\n“And where else are there wealthy individuals with the right heritage?”\nWayne asked. “A place where people wear their finest jewelry, which will\nlet you rob them as a distraction? A place where you can find the right\nhostage to take as the real prize?”\nWaxillium’s mouth grew dry. “A large wedding reception.”\nThe doors at both ends of the ballroom suddenly burst open.\n5\nThe bandits didn’t look like the kind Waxillium was used to. They didn’t\nmask their faces with kerchiefs or wear dusters and wide-brimmed Roughs\nhats. Most of them wore vests and bowler-style city hats, dull trousers, and\nloose, buttoned shirts that were rolled to the elbows. They weren’t better\ndressed, really, just different.\nThey were well armed. Rifles held at shoulders for many, pistols in the\nhands of others. People throughout the ballroom noticed immediately,\nsilverware clanking and curses sounding. There were at least two dozen\nbandits, perhaps three. Waxillium noticed with dissatisfaction that some\nmore were coming in from the right, through the doors to the kitchens. They\nwould have left men behind to watch the staff and keep them from running\nfor help.\n“Hell of a time to leave your guns,” Wayne said. He moved off his seat\nand crouched beside the table, slipping his twin hardwood dueling canes out\nfrom underneath.\n“Put those down,” Waxillium said softly, counting. Thirty-five men he\ncould see. Most were congregated at the two ends of the rectangular\nballroom, directly in front of and behind Waxillium. He was in almost the\nvery center of the room.\n“What?” Wayne said sharply.\n“Put the canes down, Wayne.”\n“You can’t mean—”\n“Look at this room!” Waxillium hissed. “How many bystanders are there\nin here? Three hundred, four? What will happen if we provoke a firefight?”\n“You could protect them,” Wayne said. “Push them out of the way.”\n“Maybe,” Waxillium said. “It would be very risky. So far, none of these\nrobberies have turned violent. I won’t have you turning this one into a\nbloodbath.”\n“I don’t have to listen to you,” Wayne said sullenly. “You’re not in charge\nof me anymore, Wax.”\nWaxillium met his eyes and held them as the room filled with cries of\nalarm and concern. Looking reluctant, Wayne slid back up into his seat. He\ndidn’t put down the dueling canes, but he did keep his hands under the\ntablecloth, hiding them from view.\nMarasi had turned, watching the thieves begin to move through the room,"

She whipped out a small\nnotepad and a pencil.\n“What are you doing?” Waxillium asked.\n“Writing down descriptions,” she said, her hand shaking. “Did you know\nthat, statistically, only one out of two witnesses can accurately describe a\ncriminal who assaulted them? Worse, seven out of ten will pick the wrong\nman out of a lineup if a similar but more threatening man is presented. In\nthe moment, you are far more likely to overestimate the height of an\nassailant, and you will often describe him as being similar to a villain from\na story you’ve recently heard. It’s vital, if you are witnessing a crime, to pay\nspecial attention to the details of those involved. Oh, I’m babbling, aren’t\nI?”\nShe looked terrified, but she started writing anyway, jotting down\ndescriptions of every criminal.\n“We never needed to do stuff like that,” Wayne said, eyeing the thieves as\nthey leveled guns at the partygoers, silencing them. “Seein’ as to how if we\nwitness a crime, the guys doing it are usually dead by the end.” He shot\nWaxillium a glare.\nSeveral thieves began forcing cooks and servers out of the kitchens to\njoin the guests. “If you please!” one of the robbers bellowed, shouldering a\nshotgun. “Sit down! Remain calm! And be quiet.” He had a faint Roughs\naccent and a solid—though not tall—build, with bulging forearms and a\nmottled, grayish complexion, almost as if his face were made of granite.\nKoloss blood, Waxillium thought. Dangerous.\nPeople quieted save for a few whimperings from the overtaxed. The\nbride’s mother appeared to have fainted, and the wedding party was\nhunkered down, the groom looking angry, with a protective arm over his\nnew wife.\nA second Vanisher stepped forward. This one, in contrast to the others,\nwore a mask: a knit cloth covering his face, with a Roughs hat atop it.\n“That’s better,” he said in a firm, controlled voice. Something about that\nvoice struck Waxillium.\n“If you’re sensible, we’ll be done with this in a matter of moments,” the\nmasked Vanisher said calmingly, walking amid the tables as about a dozen\nof the bandits began to fan through the room, opening large sacks. “All we\nwant is your jewelry. Nobody needs to get hurt. It would be a shame to spoil\nsuch a fine party as this with bloodshed. Your jewelry isn’t worth your life.”\nWaxillium glanced toward Lord Harms, who was still sitting by the bar.\nHe’d begun patting his face with a handkerchief. The men with the sacks\nquickly fanned out through the room, stopping at each table and gathering\nnecklaces, rings, earrings, pocketbooks, and watches. Sometimes the items\nwere tossed in readily, sometimes reluctantly.\n“Wax…” Wayne said, voice strained.\nMarasi continued writing, pen and paper down in her lap."

A body in a leather coat, slumping to the ground. A\ngrinning face, dying with a bullet in the forehead. Winning, even as he died.\nNot again. Never again.\nWaxillium squeezed his eyes closed.\nNever again.\n“How dare you!” a voice suddenly yelled. Waxillium glanced to the side.\nA man at a nearby table had stood up, shaking off the hand of the stout\nwoman beside him. He had a thick, graying beard and wore a suit of an\nolder cut, tails in the back reaching all the way down to his ankles. “I will\nnot stay quiet, Marthin! I am a constable of the Eighth Guard!”\nThis drew the attention of the bandit leader. The masked man strolled\ntoward the outspoken man, shotgun resting easily on his shoulder. “Ah,” he\nsaid, “Lord Peterus, I believe it is.” He waved to a pair of bandits, and they\nrushed forward, weapons trained on Peterus. “Retired chief of the Eighth\nconstabulary. We’ll be needing you to give up your weapon.”\n“How dare you commit a robbery here, at a wedding celebration,”\nPeterus said. “This is outrageous! You should be ashamed of yourself.”\n“Ashamed?” the bandit leader said as his minions patted down Peterus\nand pulled a pistol—Granger model 28, optional thick grip—out of his\nshoulder holster. “Ashamed? To rob these? After what you people have\ndone to the Roughs all these years? This isn’t shameful. This here, this is\npayback.”\nThere is something about that voice, Waxillium thought, tapping the\ntable. Something familiar. Quiet down, Peterus. Don’t provoke them!\n“In the name of the law, I will see you hunted down and hanged for this!”\nPeterus cried.\nThe outlaw leader smacked Peterus across the face, knocking him to the\nground. “What know your sort of the law?” the bandit leader growled. “And\nbe careful about warning people you’re going to see them executed. That\ngives them less reason to hold back. Rust and Ruin, you people sicken me.”\nHe waved for his lackeys to resume gathering riches. The bride’s mother\nhad recovered, and was sobbing as her family was shaken down for its cash,\nincluding even the bridal necklace.\n“The bandits really are interested in the money,” Waxillium said softly.\n“See? They make each person at the table speak, to find jewelry hidden in\nmouths. Notice how they make each one stand up and then do a quick check\nof their pockets and around their seats.”\n“Of course they’re interested in the money,” Marasi whispered back.\n“That’s the expected motive for robbery, after all.”\n“It’s the hostages too, though,” Waxillium said. “I’m sure of it.”"

She hesitantly handed over the notebook as a bandit walked\ntoward their table. It was the gray-skinned one with the thick neck.\n“Wayne,” Waxillium said, “bat on the wall.”\nWayne nodded curtly, sliding over his dueling canes. Waxillium drank his\nwine, and pressed the spiral-bound notebook and the dueling canes against\nhis side of their square table. He slipped a small metal rod from his sleeve\nand pressed it against the canes, then burned steel.\nLines sprang up around him. One pointed toward the rod, and another to\nthe notebook’s wire coil. He lightly Pushed against them, then let go. The\ncanes and the notebook remained pressed against the table’s side, obscured\nby the tablecloth, which draped down over them. He had to be careful not to\nPush too hard, lest he move the table.\nThe bandit came to their table, proffering his sack.

With\nshaking hands, she searched in her pocketbook for any bills, but the bandit\njust snatched the entire thing and dumped it into his sack.\n“Please,” Waxillium said, making his voice shake. “Please, don’t hurt\nus!” He pulled out his pocket watch, then dumped it to the table, as if in\nhaste. He yanked its chain free of his vest and threw it in the sack. Then he\ngot out his pocketbook and tossed it in, conspicuously pulling out both of\nhis pockets with shaking hands to show he had nothing else. He began\npatting his coat pockets.\n“That’ll do, mate,” the koloss-blooded man said, grinning.\n“Don’t hurt me!”\n“Sit back down, you rusting git,” the bandit said, looking back at Marasi.\nHe leered, then patted her down, making her speak so he could check her\nmouth. She bore it with a deep blush, particularly when the patting down\nturned into a few solid gropes.\nWaxillium felt his eye begin to twitch.\n“Nothing else,” the bandit said with a grunt. “Why’d I get the poor\ntables? And you?” He glanced at Wayne. Behind them, another of the\nbandits found Wayne’s servant’s coat under the table, holding it up with a\nconfused expression.\n“Do I look like I’ve got anything of value, mate?” Wayne asked, dressed\nin his duster and Roughs trousers. He’d turned up his Roughs accent. “I’m\njust ’ere by mistake. Was begging in the kitchen when I heard you blokes\ncome in.”\nThe bandit grunted, but patted Wayne’s pockets anyway.

He threw away his own hat—he was wearing a knit cap underneath,\naluminum peeking through the holes—then walked off, sticking Wayne’s\nhat on his head over the cap.\nThey sat back down.\n“He took my lucky hat, Wax,” Wayne growled.\n“Steady,” Waxillium said, handing Marasi back her notebook so she\ncould return to taking covert notes.\n“Why didn’t you hide your pocketbook,” she whispered, “as you did the\nnotebook?”\n“Some of the bills in it are marked,” Waxillium said distractedly,\nwatching the masked leader. He was consulting something in his hand.\nLooked like a couple of crinkled-up sheets of paper. “That’ll allow the\nconstables to track where they get spent, if they do get spent.”\n“Marked!” Marasi said. “So you did know we’d be robbed!”\n“What? Of course I didn’t.”\n“But—”\n“Wax always carries some marked bills,” Wayne said, eyes narrowing as\nhe noticed what the leader was doing. “Just in case.”\n“Oh. That’s … very unusual.”\n“Wax is his own special brand of paranoid, miss,” Wayne said. “Is that\nbloke doing what I think he’s doing?”\n“Yes,” Waxillium said.\n“What?” Marasi asked.\n“Comparing faces to drawings in his hand,” Waxillium said. “He’s\nlooking for the right person to take as a hostage. Look how he’s strolling\nthrough the tables, checking every woman’s face. He’s got a few others\ndoing it too.”\nThey fell silent as the leader strolled past them. He was accompanied by\na fine-featured fellow with a scowl on his face. “I’m tellin’ you,” the second\nman said, “the boys are gettin’ jumpy. You can’t give ’em all this and never\nlet ’em fire the bloody things.”\nThe masked leader was silent, studying everyone at Wax’s table for a\nmoment. He hesitated briefly, then moved on.\n“You’re gonna have to let the boys loose sooner or later, boss,” the\nsecond man said, his voice trailing off. “I think…” They were soon too far\nfor Waxillium to make out what they were saying.\nNearby, Peterus—the former constable—had gotten back up into his seat.\nHis wife was holding a napkin to his bleeding head.\nThis is the best way, Waxillium told himself firmly. I’ve seen their faces.\nI’ll be able to track down who they are when they spend my money. I’ll find\nthem, and fight them on my own terms. I’ll …\nBut he wouldn’t. He’d let the constables do that part, wouldn’t he?\nWasn’t that what he kept telling himself?\nA sudden disturbance from the far side of the chamber drew his eyes.

        "text": "them Steris. It looked like they’d finally thought to sweep the ladies’ room.\nThe other bandits were making pretty good time gathering goods. There\nwere enough of them that it didn’t take too long, even with this large crowd.\n“All right,” the boss called out. “Grab a hostage.”\nToo loud, Waxillium thought.\n“Who should we take?” one of the bandits yelled back.\nThey’re making a show of it.\n“I don’t care,” the boss said.\nHe wants us to think he’s picking one at random.\n“Any of them will do,” the boss continued. “Say … that one.” He waved\nat Steris.\nSteris. One of the previous abductees was her cousin. Of course. She was\nin the same line.\nWaxillium’s eye twitching grew worse.\n“Actually,” the boss said. “We’ll take two this time.” He sent his koloss-\nblooded lackey running back toward the tables of people. “Now, nobody\nfollow, or they’ll get hurt. Remember, a few jewels aren’t worth your life.\nWe’ll cut the hostages loose once we’re sure we aren’t being followed.”\nLies, Waxillium thought. What do you want with them? Why are you—\nThe koloss-blooded man who had stolen Wayne’s hat stepped up to\nWax’s table and grabbed Marasi by the shoulder. “You’ll do,” he said.\n“You’re coming for a ride with us, pretty.”\nShe jumped as he touched her, dropping her notepad.\n“Here now,” another bandit said. “What’s this?” He picked it up, looking\nthrough it. “All it’s got is words, Tarson.”\n“Idiot,” the koloss-blooded man—Tarson—said. “You can’t read, can\nyou?” He craned over. “Here, now. That’s a description of me, isn’t it?”\n“I…” Marasi said. “I just wanted to remember, for my journal, you\nsee.…”\n“I’m sure,” Tarson said, tucking the notebook into a pocket. His hand\ncame out with a pistol, which he lowered at her head.\nMarasi grew pale.\nWaxillium stood up, steel burning in his stomach. The other bandit’s\npistol was trained at his head a second later.\n“Your lady will be just fine with us, old boy,” Tarson said with a smile on\nhis grayish lips. “Up you go.” He pulled Marasi to her feet, then pushed her\nbefore him toward the northern exit.\nWaxillium stared down the barrel of the other bandit’s pistol. With a\nmental Push, he could send that gun with a snap back into its owner’s face,\nperhaps break his nose.\nThe bandit looked like he wanted to pull the trigger. He looked eager,\nexcited by the thrill of the robbery. Waxillium had seen men like that\nbefore. They were dangerous.\nThe bandit hesitated, then glanced at his friends, and finally broke off,\njogging toward the exit. Another was shoving Steris toward the door.\n“Wax!” Wayne hissed.\nHow could a man of honor watch something like this? Every instinct of\njustice Waxillium had demanded he do something. Fight."

Fight.\n“Wax,” Wayne said softly. “Mistakes happen. Lessie wasn’t your fault.”\n“I…”\nWayne grabbed his dueling canes. “Well, I’m going to do something.”\n“It’s not worth the cost of lives, Wayne,” Waxillium said, shaking out of\nhis stupor. “This isn’t just about me. It’s true, Wayne. We—”\n“How dare you!” a familiar voice bellowed. Lord Peterus, the former\nconstable. The aging man removed the napkin from his head, stumbling to\nhis feet. “Cowards! I will be your hostage, if you require one.”\nThe bandits ignored him, most jogging toward the exits of the room,\nwaving their guns about and enjoying making the dinnergoers cringe.\n“Cowards!” Peterus yelled. “You are dogs, each and every one of you.\nI’ll see you hanged! Take me instead of one of those girls, or it will happen.\nI swear it by the Survivor himself!” He stumbled after the retreating boss,\npassing lords, ladies, and the wealthy—most of whom had gotten down and\nwere hiding under their tables.\nThere goes the only man in this room with any courage, Waxillium\nthought, suddenly feeling a powerful shame. Him and Wayne.\nSteris was almost to the door. Marasi and her captor were catching up to\nthe boss.\nI can’t let this happen. I—\n“COWARD!”\nThe masked bandit leader suddenly spun, hand snapping out, a gunshot\ncracking the air, echoing across the large ballroom. It was over in a\nheartbeat.\nThe aged Peterus collapsed in a heap. Smoke curled in the air over the\nbandit boss’s pistol.\n“Oh…” Wayne said softly. “You just made a bad mistake, mate. A very\nbad mistake.”\nThe boss turned away from the body, holstering his gun. “Fine,” he\nyelled, walking toward the door. “You can have some fun, boys. Burn it out\nof your blood quickly and meet me outside. Let’s—”\nEverything froze. People stopped in place. The curling smoke hung\nmotionless. Voices quieted. Whimpering halted. In a circle around\nWaxillium’s table, the air rippled just faintly.\nWayne stood up, shouldering his dueling canes, inspecting the room. He\nwas placing each and every one of the bandits, Waxillium knew. Judging\ndistances, preparing himself.\n“As soon as I drop the bubble,” Wayne said, “this place is going to erupt\nlike an ammunition store in a volcano.”\nWaxillium calmly reached into his jacket and slid a hidden pistol from\nbeneath his arm. He set it on the table. His twitch had vanished.\n“Well?” Wayne asked.\n“That’s a terrible metaphor. How would an ammunition store get into a\nvolcano?”\n“I don’t know. Look, are you going to fight or not?”\n“I’ve tried waiting,” Waxillium said. “I gave them a chance to leave. I\ntried giving this up.”\n“You gave it a good show, Wax.” He grimaced. “Too good a show.”"

Then he picked it up. “So be it.”\nWith his other hand, he poured out his entire pouch of steel into his wine\ncup, then downed it.\nWayne grinned. “You owe me a pint for lying to me, by the way.”\n“Lying?”\n“You said you hadn’t brought a gun.”\n“I didn’t bring a gun,” Waxillium said, reaching to the small of his back\nand sliding a second pistol out. “You know me better than that, Wayne. I\nnever go anywhere with only one. How much bendalloy do you have?”\n“Not as much as I’d like. The stuff’s damn expensive here in town. I’ve\ngot maybe enough for five minutes’ extra time. My metalminds are pretty\nmuch full, though. Spent a good two weeks sick in bed after you left.” That\nwould give Wayne some healing power, should he get shot.\nWaxillium took a deep breath; the coldness inside him melted away and\nbecame a flame as he burned steel that pinpointed each and every source of\nmetal in the room.\nIf he froze again …\nI won’t, he told himself. I cannot. “I’ll get the girls. You keep the bandits\non the south side off me. Our priority is to keep the bystanders alive.”\n“Gladly.”\n“Thirty-seven armed baddies, Wayne. In a room full of innocents. This is\ngoing to be tough. Stay focused. I’ll try to clear some space as we start. You\ncan catch a ride, if you want.”\n“Perfect as Preserves,” Wayne said, turning and putting his back to\nWaxillium’s. “You wanna know why I really came to find you?”\n“Why?”\n“I thought of you happy in a comfy bed, resting and relaxing, spending\nthe rest of your life sipping tea and reading papers while people bring you\nfood and maids rub your toes and stuff.”\n“And?”\n“And I just couldn’t leave you to a fate like that.” Wayne shivered. “I’m\ntoo good a friend to let a mate of mine die in such a terrible situation.”\n“Comfortable?”\n“No,” Wayne said. “Boring.” He shivered again.\nWaxillium smiled, then raised thumbs to hammers and cocked his pistols.\nWhen he’d been young and sought the Roughs, he’d ended up going where\nhe’d been needed. Well, maybe that had happened again.\n“Go!” he yelled, leveling his guns.\n6\nWayne dropped the speed bubble.\nFirst step, Waxillium thought as he took aim, draw their attention. He\nbegan gently Pushing away from himself in the way that created a steel\nbubble of force to interfere with bullets. It wouldn’t protect him completely,\nbut it would help. Unless they fired aluminum bullets.\nBest to be careful. And best to shoot first.\nThe robbers were eagerly raising their weapons. He could see the lust for\ndestruction in their eyes. They had been armed to the teeth, but so far, their\nrobberies had occurred without a single shot being fired."

        "text": "The robbers were eagerly raising their weapons. He could see the lust for\ndestruction in their eyes. They had been armed to the teeth, but so far, their\nrobberies had occurred without a single shot being fired.\nRather than kill a lot of people, most of them probably just wanted to\nshoot the place up a little, but such situations easily grew more violent than\nexpected. If they weren’t stopped, the Vanishers would leave behind more\nthan shattered windows and broken tables.\nWaxillium quickly chose a bandit with a shotgun and dropped him with a\nbullet to the head. A second followed. Those shotguns were least dangerous\nto Waxillium, but they’d be deadly to the cowering bystanders.\nHis shots boomed in the cavernous chamber and the guests screamed.\nSome took the chance to run for the edges of the room. Most got down\nbeside their tables. In the confusion, the bandits didn’t spot Waxillium at\nfirst.\nHe dropped another man with a bullet to the shoulder. The smart thing to\ndo from here would have been to crouch down beside a table and continue\nto fire. It would take the bandits precious moments to discover who was\nattacking them in a room so large and crowded.\nUnfortunately, the men behind him opened fire, whooping in delight.\nThey hadn’t noticed what he was doing, though the men in front of him on\nthe other side of the hall had seen their friends fall and were scattering for\ncover. In moments, the room would be a storm of lead and gunsmoke.\nTaking a deep breath, Waxillium flared his steel and tapped his iron\nmetalmind. Filling it made him lighter, but tapping it made him heavier—\nmuch heavier. He increased his weight a hundredfold. There was a\nproportional increase in the strength of his body, or so he’d guessed, as he\ndidn’t crush himself with his own weight.\nHe raised his guns high over his head to keep them out of the radius, then\nPushed outward from himself in a ring. He started carefully, gradually\nincreasing its strength. When you Pushed, it was your weight against that of\nthe object—in this case, the metal screws and bolts in the tables and chairs.\nThey were swept away from him.\nHe became the epicenter of an expanding ring of force. Tables toppled,\nchairs scraped against the floor, and people screamed in surprise. Some\nwere caught up in it, shoved away from him. Not so hard that they were\nhurt, he hoped, but it was better to suffer a few bruises than remain in the\ncenter of the room with what was coming.\nJust to the side, he saw Wayne—who had been moving carefully toward\nthe back of the room—leap up onto an overturned table, holding to its rim\nand grinning as he rode it in a rush toward the bandits back there.\nWaxillium eased off on the Push. He stood alone in a large empty space\nat the center of the dining hall, surrounded by patches of spilled wine, food,\nand fallen dishes.\nThen the firing started in earnest, the bandits in front of him letting loose\nwith a barrage. He met the onslaught of bullets with another strong Push.\nThe bullets stopped in the air, rebuffed in a wave. Given their speed, he\ncould stop bullets that way only if he was expecting them."

Given their speed, he\ncould stop bullets that way only if he was expecting them.\nHe let the bullets fly back at their owners, but didn’t Push too hard, lest\nhe strike an innocent partygoer. It was enough to send the bandits\nscrambling, however, and yelling that there was a Coinshot in the room.\nHe was in real danger now. Quick as an eyeblink, Waxillium switched\nfrom tapping his metalmind to filling it, making himself far lighter. He\npointed his revolver down and shot a bullet into the floor just behind\nhimself and Pushed off it, launching into the air. Wind rushed in his ears as\nhe threw himself over the barricade of furniture he’d made, where some of\nthe guests still huddled. Luckily, many were realizing that the perimeters of\nthe room would be much safer, and were scrambling that way.\nWaxillium dropped right in the middle of the bandits, who had started\ntaking cover behind the pile of tables and chairs. Men cursed as he spread\nhis arms, guns pointed in opposite directions, and started firing. He spun,\ndropping four men with a quick spray of bullets.\nSome bandits fired on him, but the bullets were off aim, and swerved\naway from his steel bubble. “Aluminum bullets!” one of the bandits was\nyelling. “Get out your bloody aluminum!”\nWax spun and fired two shots into that man’s chest. Then he leaped to the\nside, rolling up next to a table that had been beyond his initial Push. A quick\nPush against the nails in the top overturned it, giving him cover as the\nbandits opened fire. He caught blue lines from some of the bullets, moving\ntoo quickly for him to Push out of the way.\nOther bandits were reloading their guns. He was in luck; it seemed from\nthe curses of the bandit leaders that the men were supposed to have\naluminum bullets loaded already, at least in some of the chambers. Shooting\naluminum was like shooting gold, however, and many of the bandits\nappeared to have kept the aluminum in their pockets rather than wanting to\nhave it in the guns, where they might end up firing it by accident.\nA bandit ducked around the side of his table, aiming a pistol. Waxillium\nreacted by reflex, Pushing on the gun, slapping it back into his face.\nWaxillium dropped him with a bullet to the chest.\nEmpty, he thought to himself, counting the bullets he’d shot. He had just\ntwo left in the other gun. He glanced over the edge of his shelter, noting the\nlocations of two reloading bandits who had hidden behind overturned\ntables. He took aim quickly, increased his weight, then fired and Pushed\nwith everything he had on the bullet leaving his gun.\nThe bullet cracked in the air, driving forward into the table shelter and\ndrilling right through it, hitting the bandit on the other side. Waxillium\nrepeated, taking down the other bandit, who was stupefied to see the thick\noak table penetrated by a simple revolver bullet. Then Waxillium threw\nhimself over the top of his own table, getting to the other side just as the\nmen behind him got around the wounded and started firing at him."

This time, none of them\ngave off blue lines. Aluminum. He breathed deeply, dropping his revolvers\nand pulling out the Terringul 27 he had strapped to the inside of his calf.\nNot the largest-caliber gun, but its long barrel made it precise.\nHe spared a glance for Wayne, and counted four Vanishers down. His\nfriend was gleefully leaping off a table toward a man with a shotgun. The\ntwo became a blur as Wayne activated a speed bubble. In an instant he was\nin a different place—bullets zipping through the area he’d left—hiding\nbehind an overturned table, the bandit with the shotgun limp on the ground.\nWayne’s favorite tactic was to get close, then catch one person in the\nspeed bubble and fight them alone. He couldn’t move the speed bubble after\nputting it up, but he could move around inside of it. So when he released the\nbubble after fighting his chosen foe one-on-one, he’d be standing in a\ndifferent place than expected. Foes found him incredibly difficult to track\nand aim at.\nBut in a long fight, they’d eventually catch on and hold their fire until just\nafter Wayne dropped a bubble. It took a couple of seconds between\ndropping one and putting up another, the time when Wayne was most\nvulnerable. Of course, even when the bubble was up, Wayne wasn’t\ncompletely safe. It could be nerve-racking to know that his friend was\nfighting alone, enclosed by a bubble of accelerated time. If Wayne got into\ntrouble while inside, Waxillium couldn’t help. Wayne would be shot and\nbleeding before the bubble collapsed.\nWell, Waxillium had his own troubles. With those aluminum bullets, his\nown protective bubble was useless. He let it drop. More bullets pelted his\ntable and the floor around him, the pops of gunfire echoing in the grand\nhall. Fortunately, he could still see blue lines pointing to the ordinary steel\nof the bandits’ guns, including those of a group of men attempting to flank\nhim.\nNo time to deal with them, he thought. The bandit boss had sent Steris out\nwith one of his men, but had paused by the door himself. He didn’t seem\nsurprised by the resistance. Something about the way he stood there,\nimperious and in control … Something about the way his eyes—the only\nvisible part of his masked face—found Wax, and locked on to him …\nSomething about that voice …\nMiles? The thought was a shock.\nScreams. Marasi’s screams. Wax turned away from the bandit leader,\nfeeling an unfamiliar sense of panic. Steris needed him, but Marasi did too,\nand she was closer. The koloss-blooded man named Tarson had her; he held\nher with one arm around the neck, towing her toward the door and cursing.\nHis two companions looked about anxiously, as if expecting constables to\ncome pouring in at any moment.\nMarasi had gone limp.

She\nknew she wasn’t some simple hostage; they wanted her specifically, and\ntherefore wouldn’t shoot her.\nGood girl, Waxillium thought. It couldn’t be easy, hearing the Vanisher\nshout, feeling the barrel on her temple. A few guests hid nearby, a well-\ndressed woman and her husband holding their hands to their ears and\nwhimpering. The gunfire was loud, chaotic, though he barely noticed these\nthings any longer. He should have slipped his earplugs in, regardless. Too\nlate now.\nWaxillium ducked to the side and fired two shots into the wooden floor to\ncause those flanking him to duck for cover. The Terringul was loaded with\nhollow-point bullets specifically designed to lodge in wood, giving him a\ngood anchor when he needed one. They also happened to lodge in flesh,\nreducing the chances of a through-and-through shot that could injure\nbystanders, which suited him just fine.\nHe dashed forward in a crouch and leaped onto a large serving platter. He\npressed one foot against the lip of the platter, and Pushed on the bullets\nbehind him. The maneuver threw him forward in a skid across the polished\nwooden floor. He broke out of the tables into open space just before the\nsteps out of the room, then kicked the platter out from under him and\nincreased his weight, hitting the ground and stopping.\nThe platter flipped out in front of him, and the startled bandits began\nfiring. Metal pinged against metal as some of the bullets hit the platter;\nWaxillium responded, dropping the men on either side of Tarson with two\nquick shots. Then he flared his steel and Pushed toward Tarson’s gun to try\nknocking it away from Marasi.\nOnly then did Waxillium realize there was no blue line pointing to the\nman’s gun. Tarson grinned, his ashy face topped by Wayne’s hat. Then he\nwhipped around, placing himself behind Marasi, whom he gripped by the\nneck with one hand, holding the gun steady against her head with the other.\nNo blue lines. Rust and Ruin … an entire gun made of aluminum?\nWaxillium and Tarson both fell still. The bandits behind hadn’t noticed\nWaxillium’s floor-level escape on the platter; they were closing on the area\nwhere he’d been hiding. The boss still stood in the doorway, looking toward\nWaxillium. Wax had to be wrong about who he was. People could look\nalike, sound alike. That didn’t mean …\nMarasi whimpered. And Waxillium found himself unable to move,\nunable to raise his hand to fire. The shot he’d made to save Lessie played\nagain and again in his mind.\nI can make a shot like that, he thought to himself, angry. I’ve done it a\ndozen times.\nHe’d only missed once.\nHe couldn’t move, couldn’t think. He kept seeing her die again and\nagain. Blood in the air, a smiling face.\nTarson apparently realized that Waxillium wouldn’t fire. So he swung his\ngun away from Marasi’s head and toward Waxillium."

So he swung his\ngun away from Marasi’s head and toward Waxillium.\nMarasi went rigid. She locked her legs and slammed her head upward\ninto the Vanisher’s chin. Tarson’s shot went wild and he stumbled\nbackward, holding his mouth.\nWith Marasi mostly out of the way, Waxillium’s mind cleared, and he\nfound himself able to move again. He shot Tarson, though he couldn’t bring\nhimself to aim for the chest, not with Marasi stumbling nearby. He settled\non dropping Tarson with a shot to the arm. Marasi raised her hand to her\nmouth in horror, watching him fall.\n“He’s over there!” Voices from behind, the three bandits he’d been\nfighting among the tables. An aluminum bullet split the air just beside him.\n“Hold on,” Waxillium said to Marasi, leaping forward and grabbing her\naround the waist. He raised his gun and shot the last bullet in his gun\ntoward the doorway, hitting the masked leader of the Vanishers in the head.\nThe man collapsed in a heap.\nWell, there goes that theory, Waxillium thought. Miles wouldn’t have\nfallen to a mere bullet. He was a Twinborn of a particularly dangerous\nvariety.\nTarson was rolling over, holding his arm and groaning. No time. Guns\nempty. Waxillium dropped the gun and Pushed on it while holding tightly to\nMarasi. The Push hurled the two of them into the air; a hail of bullets\nsprayed through the space where they’d been. Unfortunately, they missed\nTarson, who was rolling on the floor.\nMarasi cried out, clinging to him as they flew up toward the brilliant\nchandeliers. Waxillium pushed off one of them, causing it to rock back and\nforth. That Push threw him and Marasi toward the nearby balcony, which\nwas occupied by a group of cowering musicians.\nWaxillium landed hard on the balcony; he was off-balance from carrying\nMarasi, and hadn’t had time to judge the Push precisely. They rolled in a\nbundle of red and white fabric. When they came to a rest, Marasi clung to\nhim, shaking and gasping for breath.\nHe sat up, and held her for a moment. “Thank you,” she whispered.\n“Thank you.”\n“Don’t mention it,” he said. “That was very brave, stopping the bandit as\nyou did.”\n“Seven out of ten kidnappings can be foiled by appropriate resistance on\nthe part of the target,” she said, words tumbling out of her mouth. She\nsqueezed her eyes closed again. “Sorry. That was just very, very unsettling.”\n“I—” He froze.\n“What?” she asked, opening her eyes.\nWaxillium didn’t respond. He rolled to the side, pulling loose from her\ngrip as he noticed the blue lines moving to the left.

The instrument crashed into the wooden doorway and smashed\nthe men against the wall. They slumped down, dropping to the stairs under\nthe broken harp.\nWaxillium ran to check their vitals. Convinced they wouldn’t be\ndangerous any time soon, he grabbed the handguns and dashed back to the\nedge of the balcony, scanning the room below. The furniture he’d Pushed\nout of the way made a strange perfectly circular open space on the ballroom\nfloor. Partygoers were making for the kitchens in increasingly large\nnumbers. He looked for Wayne, but saw only the broken bodies of fallen\nbandits where he’d been.\n“Steris?” Marasi asked, crawling up beside him.\n“I’ll go after her right now,” Waxillium said. “Some men towed her\noutside, but they won’t have had time to…” He trailed off as he noticed a\nblur beside the far door. It stopped, and suddenly Wayne was lying on the\nground, blood pooling around him. A bandit stood above him looking quite\npleased with himself, holding a smoking pistol.\nDamn! Waxillium thought, feeling a spike of fear. If Wayne had been hit\nin the head …\nSteris or Wayne?\nShe’ll be safe, he thought. They took her for a reason; they need her.\n“Oh no!” Marasi said, pointing at Wayne. “Lord Ladrian, is that—”\n“He’ll be all right if I can get to him,” Waxillium said, hastily shoving a\npistol into Marasi’s hands. “Can you use one of these?”\n“I—”\n“Just start firing it if someone threatens you. I’ll come.” He leaped up\nonto the balcony railing. His way was mostly blocked by the chandeliers; he\ncouldn’t make a direct jump to Wayne. He’d have to jump down, then up\nagain, and bound to—\nNo time. Wayne was dying.\nGo!\nWaxillium threw himself off the balcony. As soon as his feet were free,\nhe tapped his metalmind and drew forth as much weight as he could. That\ndidn’t tow him to the ground; an object fell at the same speed, no matter its\nweight. Only air resistance mattered.\nHowever, weight did matter a great deal when Pushing—which\nWaxillium did, throwing everything he had against the chandeliers. They\nripped apart in a line, the metal inside them twisting upon itself, crystal\nexploding outward in a shower. That gave him plenty of room along the\nupper portion of the room to jump in an arc toward Wayne.\nIn a heartbeat, Waxillium stopped tapping his metalmind and started\nfilling it instead, decreasing his weight to almost nothing. He Pushed on the\nbroken harp behind, and a simultaneous quick Push against the nails in the\nfloor kept him high.\nThe result was that he soared across the room in a graceful arc, passing\nthrough the space the large chandeliers had occupied.

The glittering smaller\nchandeliers continued to shine on either side of him while crystal showered\nbeneath, each tiny piece splintering the light into a spray of colors. His suit\ncoat flapped, and he lowered the single revolver in his hand as he fell,\npointing it at the bandit standing over Wayne.\nWaxillium emptied six chambers at the thief. He couldn’t afford to take\nchances.\nThe pistol was slick in Waxillium’s hand as he hit the ground, Pushing on\nthe floor nails to keep from breaking his legs. The thief slumped back\nagainst the wall, dead.\nJust as Waxillium reached Wayne, a speed bubble sprang up around\nthem. Waxillium exhaled in relief as Wayne stirred; he knelt to turn his\nfriend face upward. Wayne’s shirt was soaked with blood, a bullet hole\nvisible in his belly. As Waxillium watched, it slowly closed up, healing\nitself.\n“Damn,” Wayne said, groaning. “Gut wounds hurt.”\nWayne couldn’t have kept the bubble up while the bandit was alive—that\nwould have told him Wayne wasn’t dead. Outlaws and lawmen alike were\naccustomed to Metalborn; if the bubble had stayed up, the bandit would\nhave quickly shot Wayne in the head.\nSo Wayne had been forced to drop the bubble and play dead. Luckily, the\nbandit hadn’t turned him over to check his vitals and noticed that the wound\nwas healing. Wayne was a Bloodmaker, a type of Feruchemist who could\nstore health in the way that Waxillium stored weight. If Wayne spent some\ntime being sickly and weak—his body healing itself much more slowly than\nnormal—he could store up the health and healing ability in a metalmind.\nThen, when he tapped it, he healed at a greatly increased rate.\n“How much do you have left in your metalmind?” Waxillium asked.\n“That was the second bullet wound of the night,” Wayne said. “I can\nmaybe heal one more.” Wayne stood as Waxillium pulled him to his feet.\n“Took me a good two weeks in bed to store up that much. Hope that girl of\nyours is worth it.”\n“Girl of mine?”\n“Oh, c’mon, mate. Don’t think I didn’t see how you were looking at her\nduring dinner. You always did like ’em smart.” He grinned.\n“Wayne,” Waxillium said. “Lessie hasn’t even been gone a year.”\n“You have to move on eventually.”\n“I’m done with this conversation,” Waxillium said, looking over the\nnearby tables. Vanisher bodies lay strewn about, bones broken by Wayne’s\ndueling canes. Waxillium spotted a few living ones hiding behind tables for\ncover, as if they hadn’t realized yet that Wayne didn’t carry guns.\n“Five left?” Waxillium asked.\n“Six,” Wayne said, picking up and spinning his dueling canes. “There’s\nanother in the shadows over there. I brought down seven. You?”\n“Sixteen, I think,” Wax said distractedly. “Haven’t been counting\ncarefully.”\n“Sixteen? Damn, Wax. I was hoping you’d have rusted a bit, was thinkin’"

I was hoping you’d have rusted a bit, was thinkin’\nmaybe I’d be able to catch you this time.”\nWaxillium smiled. “It’s not a competition.” He hesitated. “Even if I am\nwinning. Some men got out the door with Steris. I shot the guy who took\nyour hat, though he lived. He’s probably gone by now.”\n“You didn’t grab the hat for me?” Wayne asked, sounding offended.\n“I was a little busy being shot at.”\n“Busy? Aw, mate. It doesn’t take any effort at all to get shot at. I think\nyou’re just makin’ excuses on account of being jealous of my lucky hat.”\n“That’s it entirely,” Waxillium said, fishing in his pocket. “How much\ntime you have left?”\n“Not much,” Wayne said. “Bendalloy’s almost gone. Maybe twenty\nseconds.”\nWaxillium took a deep breath. “I’m going for the three on the left. You go\nright. Get ready to jump.”\n“Got it.”\n“Go!”\nWayne ran forward and leaped onto a table in front of them. He dropped\nthe speed bubble right as he launched himself off, and Waxillium braced\nhimself by increasing his weight, then Pushed on Wayne’s metalminds,\nsending the man soaring through the air in an arc toward the bandits. Once\nWayne was airborne, Waxillium flipped from tapping his metalmind to\nfilling it, then Pushed on some nails, launching himself into the air in a\nslightly different trajectory.\nWayne hit first, probably landing so hard he had to heal himself as he\nrolled between a pair of hiding bandits. He came up to his feet and slammed\nhis dueling canes down on one bandit’s arm. He then spun and smashed a\ncane into the second man’s neck.\nWaxillium tossed his gun as he fell, Pushing it hard into the face of a\nstartled thief. He landed, then tossed the empty cartridge that Wayne had\ngiven him earlier—the one that had contained the message—at a second\nman. Pushing on it, he turned the casing into an improvised bullet,\nslamming it into the man’s forehead and piercing his skull.\nWaxillium shoved on the casing hard enough that it tossed him to the\nside. He plowed his shoulder into the chest of the man he’d thrown his gun\nat. The man stumbled back, and Waxillium slammed his forearm—and its\nmetalmind bracer—into the man’s head, dropping him.\nOne more, he thought. Behind me to the right. It was going to be close.\nWaxillium kicked the gun he’d dropped, intending to Push it toward the\nfinal bandit.\nA gunshot sounded.\nWaxillium froze, anticipating the pain of a bullet hitting him. Nothing\nhappened. He spun to find the final bandit slumped over a table, bleeding, a\ngun dropping from his fingers.\nWhat by the Survivor’s scars…?\nHe looked up.

She’d\nfetched the rifle from the bandit he’d crushed, and she obviously knew how\nto use it. Even as he watched, she fired again, dropping the bandit in the\nshadows Wayne had mentioned.\nWayne stood up from finishing off his two assailants. He looked confused\nuntil Waxillium pointed toward Marasi.\n“Wow,” Wayne said, stepping up to him. “I’m liking her more and more.\nDefinitely the one of the two I’d pick if I were you.”\nThe one of the two.\nSteris!\nWaxillium cursed and leaped forward, throwing himself in a Steelpush\nacross the room toward the other exit. He hit the ground running, noting\nwith concern that the boss’s body wasn’t where he’d dropped it. There was\nblood in the entryway. Had they dragged him away?\nUnless … Maybe his theory wasn’t wrong after all. But damn it, he\ncouldn’t be facing Miles. Miles was a lawman. One of the best.\nWaxillium burst out into the night—this ballroom exit led directly to the\nstreet. Some horses stood here tied to a fence, and what looked like a group\nof grooms lay gagged and bound on the ground.\nSteris, and the bandits who had carried her out, were gone. He did find a\nlarge group of constables riding into the courtyard, however.\n“Great timing, chaps,” Waxillium said, sitting down on the steps,\nexhausted.\n* * *\n“I don’t care who you are or how much money you have,” Constable Brettin\nsaid. “This is a total mess you’ve created, sir.”\nWaxillium sat on his stool, listening with only half an ear as he rested\nwith his back against the wall. He was going to ache in the morning. He\nhadn’t pushed his body so hard in months. He was lucky he hadn’t twisted\nanything or thrown out a muscle.\n“This isn’t the Roughs,” Brettin continued. “You think you can do\nanything you want? You think you can just pick up a gun and take the law\ninto your own hands?”\nThey sat in the kitchens of Yomen Manor, in a side area that the\nconstables had partitioned off for interviews. It hadn’t been long since the\nend of the fight. Just long enough for the trouble to begin.\nThough his ears still rang from the noise of the gunfire, Waxillium could\nalso hear moans and cries from the ballroom as the partygoers were seen to.\nBeyond that, he could hear the clopping of hooves and the racket of the\noccasional automobile out in the mansion courtyard as the city’s elite fled in\ngroups as they were released. The constables would be speaking to each\nperson, making certain they were well and checking their names off the\nguest list.\n“Well?” Brettin demanded. He was the constable-general, head of the\nconstabulary in their octant. He was probably feeling very threatened by the\nrobberies happening under his watch. Waxillium could imagine what it\nwould be like in his position, getting thunder each day from powers above\nhim who were not pleased.\n“I’m sorry, constable,” Waxillium said calmly. “Old habits make for"

I should have restrained myself, but would you have done any\ndifferent? Would you have watched women being kidnapped and done\nnothing?”\n“I have a legal right and responsibility you do not.”\n“I have a moral right and responsibility, constable.”\nBrettin harrumphed, but the calm words mollified him somewhat. He\nglanced to the side as a brown-suited constable wearing one of their\ndomelike hats entered and saluted.\n“Well?” Brettin asked. “What’s the news, Reddi?”\n“Twenty-five dead, Captain,” the man said.\nBrettin groaned. “You see what you’ve caused, Ladrian? If you’d just\nkept your head down like everyone else, then those poor folks would still be\nalive. Ruination! This is a mess. I could hang for this—”\n“Captain,” Reddi interrupted. He stepped in and spoke softly. “Excuse\nme, sir. But those were the bandit casualties. Twenty-five of them dead, sir.\nSix captured alive.”\n“Oh. And how many civilians killed?”\n“Just one, sir. Lord Peterus. He was shot before Lord Ladrian started\nfighting back. Sir.” Reddi was regarding Waxillium with a mixture of awe\nand respect.\nBrettin glanced at Waxillium, then grabbed his lieutenant by the arm and\ntowed him a little farther off. Waxillium closed his eyes, breathed softly,\nand caught some of the conversation.\n“You mean … two men … thirty-one by themselves?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“… else wounded…?”\n“… broken bones … not too serious … bruises and scrapes … going to\nopen fire…”\nThere was silence, and Waxillium opened his eyes to find the constable-\ngeneral staring at him. Brettin waved Reddi away, then walked back.\n“Well?” Waxillium asked.\n“You appear to be a lucky man.”\n“My friend and I drew their attention,” Waxillium said. “And most of the\npartygoers already had their heads down when the shooting began.”\n“You still broke bones with your Allomantic stunt,” the constable-general\nsaid. “There will be bruised egos and angry lords. They’ll come to me when\nthey complain.”\nWaxillium said nothing.\nBrettin crouched down before Waxillium, getting in close. “I know about\nyou,” he said softly. “I knew eventually I’d be having this talk with you. So\nlet me be clear. This is my city, and I have the authority here.”\n“Is that so?” Waxillium asked, feeling very tired.\n“It is.”\n“So where were you when the bandits started shooting people in the\nhead?”\nBrettin’s face grew red, but Waxillium held his eyes.\n“I’m not threatened by you,” Brettin said.\n“Good. I haven’t said anything threatening yet.”\nBrettin hissed softly, then pointed at Waxillium, tapping a finger against\nhis chest. “Keep your tongue civil.

Maybe by morning you’ll have found the other half of your\nmind, and we’ll be able to have a reasonable conversation.”\nBrettin’s face grew even redder, but he knew—as Waxillium did—that he\nwouldn’t dare throw a house lord into jail without significant justification.\nBrettin finally broke away, waving a dismissive hand at Waxillium and\nstalking out of the kitchen.\nWaxillium sighed, standing up and taking his bowler off the counter\nwhere he’d left it. Harmony protect us from small-minded men with too\nmuch power. He donned the hat and walked out into the ballroom.\nThe room had been mostly cleared of guests, the wedding party itself\ntaken in Lord Yomen’s carriage to a place where they could recover from\nthe ordeal. The ballroom swarmed with an almost equal number of\nconstables and physicians. The wounded were sitting on the raised wooden\nfloor just before the exit; there looked to be about twenty or thirty people\nthere. Waxillium noticed Lord Harms sitting at a table off to the side,\nstaring down with a morose expression, Marasi trying to comfort him.\nWayne was at the table too, looking bored.\nWaxillium walked over to them, removing his hat, and sat down. He\nfound that he didn’t exactly know what to say to Lord Harms.\n“Hey,” Wayne whispered. “Here.” He handed Waxillium something\nunder the table. A revolver.\nWaxillium looked at him, confused. It wasn’t his.\n“Figured you’d want one of these.”\n“Aluminum?”\nWayne smiled, eyes twinkling. “Snatched it out of the collection the\nconstables made. Apparently there were ten of these. Figured you could sell\nit. I spent a lot of bendalloy fighting these gits. Need some money to replace\nit. But don’t worry, I left a real nice drawing I did in the gun’s place when I\ntook it. Here.”\nHe handed over something else. A handful of bullets. “Grabbed these\ntoo.”\n“Wayne,” Waxillium said, fingering the long, narrow cartridges, “you\nrealize these are rifle rounds?”\n“So?”\n“So they won’t fit a revolver.”\n“They won’t? Why not?”\n“Because.”\n“Kind of a dumb way to make bullets, innit?” He seemed baffled. Of\ncourse, most things about guns baffled Wayne, who was generally better off\nthrowing a gun at someone than trying to fire it at them.\nWaxillium shook his head in amusement, but didn’t turn the gun down.\nHe had wanted one. He slipped the revolver into one of his shoulder\nholsters and turned to Lord Harms.\n“My lord,” Waxillium said. “I have failed you.”\nHarms dabbed his face with his handkerchief, looking pale. “Why would\nthey take her? They’ll let her go, won’t they? They said they would.”\nWaxillium fell silent.\n“They won’t,” Lord Harms said, looking up. “They haven’t let any of the\nothers go, have they?”\n“No,” Waxillium said."

It can be replaced, and\nmost of it was insured anyway. But I’ll pay any price for Steris. Please. She\nis to be your fiancée! You have to find her!”\nWaxillium looked into the older man’s eyes, and saw fear there.\nWhatever bravado this man had shown in earlier meetings, it was an act.\nFunny, how quickly someone can stop calling you a miscreant and a\nrogue when they want your help, Waxillium thought. But if there was\nsomething he couldn’t ignore, it was a sincere request for help.\n“I’ll find her,” Waxillium said. “I promise it, Lord Harms.”\nHarms nodded. Then, he slowly pushed himself to his feet.\n“Let me help you to the carriage, my lord,” Marasi said.\n“No,” Harms said, waving her down. “No. Just let me … just let me go\nand sit by myself. I won’t leave without you, but please give me some time\nalone.” He walked away, leaving Marasi standing with her hands clasped.\nShe sat back down, looking sick. “He wishes it were she you had rescued\nand not me,” she said softly.\n“So, Wax,” Wayne butted in. “Where did you say that bloke was who had\nmy hat?”\n“I told you that he got away after I shot him.”\n“I was hoping he’d dropped my hat, you know. Getting shot makes\npeople drop stuff.”\nWaxillium sighed. “He still had it on when he left, I’m afraid.”\nWayne started cursing.\n“Wayne,” Marasi said. “It’s only a hat.”\n“Only a hat?” he asked, aghast.\n“Wayne’s a little attached to that hat,” Waxillium said. “He thinks it’s\nlucky.”\n“It is lucky. I ain’t never died while wearing that hat.”\nMarasi frowned. “I … I’m not sure I know how to respond.”\n“That’s a common reaction to Wayne,” Waxillium said. “I did want to\nthank you for your timely intervention, by the way. Do you mind if I ask\nwhere you learned to shoot like that?”\nMarasi blushed. “Ladies’ target club at the university. We’re quite well\nranked against other clubs in the city.” She grimaced. “I don’t suppose …\neither of those fellows I shot pulled through?”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “You plugged them right good, you did. The one\nnear me left brains all over the door!”\n“Oh dear.” Marasi grew pale. “I never expected…”\n“It’s what happens when you shoot someone,” Wayne pointed out. “At\nleast, usually someone has the good sense to get dead when you go to all\nthe trouble to shoot them. Unless you miss anything vital. That bloke what\ntook my hat?”\n“I hit him in the arm,” Waxillium said. “But it should have brought him\ndown better than it did. He has koloss blood for sure.

Might be a Pewterarm\nas well.”\nThat quieted Wayne. He was probably thinking the same thing as\nWaxillium—a band like this, with these numbers and such nice weapons,\nwas likely to have at least a couple of Allomancers or Feruchemists among\nthem.\n“Marasi,” Waxillium said, as something occurred to him, “is Steris an\nAllomancer?”\n“What? No. She isn’t.”\n“You certain?” Waxillium asked. “She might have been hiding it.”\n“She’s not an Allomancer,” Marasi said. “Nor a Feruchemist. I can\npromise it.”\n“Well, there’s a theory rusted away,” Wayne said.\n“I need to think,” Waxillium said, tapping the table with his fingernail.\n“Too much about these Vanishers doesn’t make sense.” He shook his head.\n“But, for now, I should bid you a good evening. I’m exhausted, and if I may\nbe bold enough to say it, you look the same.”\n“Yes, of course,” Marasi said.\nThey stood, walking toward the exit. The constables didn’t stop them,\nthough some did shoot Waxillium hostile looks. Others seemed\ndisbelieving. A few looked awed.\nThis night, like the four previous, lacked any mists. Waxillium and\nWayne walked Marasi to her uncle’s carriage. Lord Harms sat inside,\nstaring straight ahead.\nAs they arrived, Marasi took Waxillium’s arm. “You really should have\ngone for Steris first,” she said softly.\n“You were closer. Logic dictated I save you first.”\n“Well, whatever the reason,” she said, voice even more soft, “thank you\nfor what you did. I just … Thank you.” She looked like she wanted to say\nmore, staring up into his eyes, then went onto her tiptoes and kissed him on\nthe cheek. Before he could react, she turned away and climbed into the\ncarriage.\nWayne stepped up to him as the carriage moved off into the dark street,\nhorses’ shoes clattering on the paving stones. “So,” Wayne said, “you’re\ngoing to marry her cousin?”\n“Such is the plan.”\n“Awkward.”\n“She is an impulsive young woman half my age,” Waxillium said. An\napparently brilliant, beautiful, intriguing young woman who also happens\nto be an excellent shot. Once, that combination would have left him\ncompletely smitten. Now, he barely gave it a passing thought.\nHe turned away from the carriage. “Where are you staying?”\n“Not sure yet,” Wayne said. “I found this house where the folks who lives\nthere is away, but I think they might be back tonight. Left ’em some bread\nas a thanks.”\nWaxillium sighed. I should have guessed. “I’ll give you a room,\nassuming you promise not to steal too much.”\n“What? I never steal, mate. Stealing’s bad.” He ran a hand through his\nhair and grinned. “Might need to trade you for a hat to wear till I get my\nother one back, though. Do you need any bread?”"

Do you need any bread?”\nWaxillium just shook his head, waving for his carriage to drive them\nback to Ladrian Mansion.\n7\nThe morning after the assault on the wedding dinner, Marasi stood before\nthe imposing mansion at Sixteen Ladrian Place, holding her handbag before\nher in both hands. She always liked to grip something before herself when\nshe was nervous, a bad habit. As Professor Modicarm said, “Obvious visual\ntells must be assiduously avoided by a practitioner of the law, lest he\ninadvertently give criminals an insight into his emotional state.”\nThinking over quotes from her professors was another of her nervous\nhabits. She continued to stand on the stone-paved sidewalk, indecisive.\nWould Lord Waxillium find it odd or invasive of her to come? Did he think\nher a silly girl with a silly hobby who foolishly assumed she could be of use\nto a seasoned lawman?\nShe should probably just go up and knock. But didn’t she have a right to\nbe nervous when confronting a man such as Waxillium Ladrian? A living\nlegend, one of her personal heroes?\nA young gentleman passed on the sidewalk behind her, walking an eager\ndog. He tipped his hat to her, though he spared a brief distrustful glance for\nLadrian Mansion.\nThe building didn’t seem to deserve such scrutiny; the venerable\nstructure was built of stately, vine-bedecked stone, with large windows and\nan old iron gate. Three mature apple trees spread limbs over the front\ngarden, and a member of the grounds staff was lazily sawing off a few dead\nbranches. City law established by the Lord Mistborn himself required that\neven ornamental trees provide food.\nWhat would it be like to visit the Roughs, she thought idly, where the\ntrees are scraggly and short? The Roughs must be a fascinating place.\nPlants here in the Elendel Basin grew bountifully with little need for care or\ncultivation. A final gift of the Survivor, his munificent touch upon the land.\nStop fidgeting, she told herself. Be firm. Control your surroundings. That\nwas something Professor Aramine had said just last week, and—\nDamn it! She strode forward, through the open gate, up the steps, and to\nthe door. She slammed the knocker down on the door three times.\nA long-faced butler answered. He looked her up and down with\ndispassionate eyes. “Lady Colms.”\n“I was hoping I might see Lord Ladrian?”\nThe butler raised an eyebrow, then swung the door open the rest of the\nway. He said nothing, but a lifetime growing up around servants such as\nhim—servants trained after the ancient Terris ideal—had taught her to read\nhis actions. He did not think she should be visiting Waxillium, and\nparticularly not alone.\n“The sitting room is currently unoccupied, my lady,” the butler said,\npointing a stiff hand—palm up—toward a side chamber. He began stalking\ntoward the staircase, moving with a sense of … inevitability. Like an\nancient tree swaying in the wind.\nShe strolled into the room, forcing herself to hold her handbag at her"

Like an\nancient tree swaying in the wind.\nShe strolled into the room, forcing herself to hold her handbag at her\nside. Ladrian Mansion was decorated in a classical mode; the rugs had\nintricate patterns in dark shades, and the ornately carved picture frames\nwere painted gold. Odd, that so many should favor frames that seemed to be\ntrying to outdo the art they held.\nDid it seem there was less art hanging in the mansion than there should\nbe? Several spots on the walls were conspicuously empty. In the sitting\nroom, she looked up at a wide painting of a field of grain, clasping her\nhands behind her back.\nGood. She was containing her nervousness now. There was no reason for\nit at all. Yes, she had read report after report about Waxillium Ladrian. Yes,\nstories of his bravery had been part of what inspired her to study law.\nHowever, he was far more amiable than she’d imagined. She had always\npictured him as gruff and stoic. Discovering that he spoke like a gentleman\nhad been a surprise. And, of course, there was the relaxed—if acerbic—way\nhe interacted with Wayne. Five minutes around the two of them had\ndestroyed years’ worth of youthful illusions about the calm, quiet lawman\nand his intense, devoted deputy.\nThen the attack had come. The gunfire, the screaming. And Waxillium\nLadrian, like a bolt of intense, bright lightning in the middle of a dark and\nchaotic tempest. He had saved her. How many days during her youth had\nshe fondly dreamed of something like that happening?\n“Lady Colms?” the butler said, stepping up to the doorway of the room.\n“I apologize, but the master says that he cannot spare the time to come\ndown and converse with you.”\n“Oh,” she said, feeling an immediate sinking in her stomach. So she’d\nmade a fool of herself after all.\n“Indeed, my lady,” the butler said, lips turning down even farther. “You\nare to accompany me to his study so he can converse with you there.”\nOh. Well, she hadn’t expected that.\n“This way please,” the butler said. He turned around and lurched up the\nstairs, and she followed. At the top floor, they twisted through a few\nhallways—passing some serving and cleaning staff, who bobbed in respect\nto her—until they reached a room that dominated the far western side of the\nmansion.\nThe butler gestured for her to enter. The room beyond was much more\ncluttered than she’d anticipated. The shutters were closed and the shades\ndrawn, and the large desk that dominated the far wall had been set up with\ntubes, burners, and other scientific-looking apparatus.\nWaxillium stood to the side, holding something up with a pair of tongs\nand studying it intently. He wore a pair of black goggles, and had on a white\nshirt with sleeves rolled to the elbows. His suit coat lay draped over a chair\nat the side of the room, bowler hat topping it, leaving him in a diagonally\ncheckered vest of black and gray. The room smelled of smoke and, oddly,\nsulfur.\n“My lord?” the butler said."

Come in, come\nin. Tillaume, you may leave us.”\n“Yes, my lord,” the butler said with a suffering tone.\nMarasi stepped into the room, glancing to the side where a large sheet of\npaper lay on the floor, folded upon itself and covered with cramped writing.\nWaxillium twisted a dial, and a small metal tube on the desk shot out a thin\ntongue of intense flame. He briefly held his tongs in the fire, then pulled\nthem back out and dropped their contents into a small ceramic cup. He eyed\nit, then grabbed a glass tube from a rack on the desk and shook it.\n“Here,” he said, holding it up for her to study. There was a clear liquid in\nit. “Does this look blue to you?”\n“Er … no? Should it?”\n“Apparently not,” he said. He shook the tube again. “Huh.” He set the\ntube aside.\nShe stood silently. It was so hard not to recall the sight of him breaking\nthrough the line of tables, gun in hand as he expertly felled two of the men\ntrying to haul her out into the night. Or the sight of him soaring through the\nair—gunshots exploding up from beneath, the chandeliers shattering and\ncrystal spraying light around him—as he shot a man from midair and\ndropped to rescue his friend.\nShe was talking to a legend. And he was wearing a pair of very silly\ngoggles.\nWaxillium raised them to his forehead. “I’m trying to figure out what\nalloy they used in those guns.”\n“The aluminum ones?” she asked, curious.\n“Yes, but they’re not pure aluminum. They’re something stronger, and\nthe grain is wrong. I’ve never seen this alloy before. And the bullets must\nbe yet another new alloy; I’ll need to test those next. As a side note, I’m not\ncertain if you appreciate the advantages you possess living in the City.”\n“Oh, I’d say I’m aware of many of them.”\nHe grinned. Oddly, he looked younger today than he had on their\nprevious meetings. “I suppose that perhaps you do. I was referring\nspecifically to the ease of shopping you enjoy here.”\n“Shopping?”\n“Yes, shopping! Marvelous convenience. Out in Weathering, if I wanted\na gas burner that could reach the high temperatures required for testing\nalloys, I had to special-order it and wait for the right railway cars to come.\nThen I had to hope the equipment arrived without being damaged or broken.\n“Here, however, I merely needed to send a few lads out with a list. In\nhours, I could set up an entire lab.” He shook his head. “I feel so spoiled.\nAnd you seem hesitant about something. Is it the sulfur? I needed to test the\ngunpowder in the bullets, you see … and, well, I suppose I should open a\nwindow.”\nI will not be nervous around him. “It’s not that, my lord Ladrian.”\n“Please, feel free to call me ‘Wax’ or ‘Waxillium,’” he said, walking over"

She noticed that he stood to the side as he opened it, never\nstanding directly in the line of sight of anyone outside. The cautious\nbehavior was natural to him, and he didn’t even seem to notice what he was\ndoing. “There’s no need to be formal with me. I have a rule—saving my life\nentitles you to use my given name.”\n“You saved mine first, I believe.”\n“Yes. But I was already in your debt, you see.”\n“Because?”\n“Because you gave me an excellent excuse to shoot things,” he replied,\nsitting down at his desk and making a few notations on a pad there. “That\nseems to be something I’d been needing for quite some time.” He looked up\nand smiled at her. “The hesitance?”\n“Should we be alone in the room, Lord Waxillium?”\n“Why not?” he said, sounding genuinely confused. “Is there a mass\nmurderer hiding in the wardrobe that I somehow missed?”\n“I was actually referring to propriety, my lord.”\nHe sat for a moment, then smacked his forehead. “I apologize. You’ll\nhave to forgive me for being a buffoon. It’s been a long time since I’ve had\nto … Never mind. If you’re uncomfortable, I’ll go call Tillaume back.” He\nrose, striding past her.\n“Lord Waxillium!” she said. “I’m not uncomfortable. I assure you. I\nsimply didn’t want to put you in an awkward position.”\n“Awkward?”\n“Yes.” Now she felt like a right fool. “Please. I didn’t mean to make a\nfuss.”\n“Very well, then,” he said. “To be honest, I really had forgotten about\nthings like this. It’s basically nonsense, you realize.”\n“Propriety is nonsense?”\n“Too much in high society is built around the idea of making certain you\ndon’t need to trust anyone,” Waxillium said. “Contracts, detailed operating\nreports, not being seen alone with an eligible member of the opposite\ngender. If you remove the foundation of trust from a relationship, then what\nis the point of that relationship?”\nThis from someone who is marrying Steris for the express purpose of\nexploiting her wealth? She felt bad for the thought. It was very difficult not\nto feel bitter sometimes.\nShe moved on quickly. “So … the alloy?”\n“Yes, the alloy,” he said. “Likely a tangent I shouldn’t be indulging in.\nAn excuse to dig up an old hobby. But since I know where the aluminum\nitself came from—the first theft—I wondered if, perhaps, they might be\nusing an alloy that includes components I could trace.” He walked back\nover to his desk, where he picked up the revolver Wayne had given him the\nnight before. She could see that he’d shaved some of the metal off the\noutside of the grip.\n“Do you know much of metallurgy, Lady Marasi?” he asked.\n“I’m afraid not,” she said. “I probably should.”\n“Oh, don’t feel that way. As I said, this is an indulgence of mine. There"

There\nare many metallurgists in the city; I could probably have sent these shavings\nto one of them and gotten a report more quickly, and more accurately.” He\nsighed, sitting back down in his chair. “I’m just accustomed to doing things\nmyself, you see.”\n“Out in the Roughs, you often didn’t have another choice.”\n“True enough.” He tapped the gun against the table. “Alloys are\nremarkable things, Lady Marasi. Did you realize you can make an alloy\nwith a metal that reacts to magnetism, but end up with one that doesn’t?\nMix it with an equal part of something else, and you don’t get something\nthat’s half as magnetically reactive—you get something that’s not reactive\nat all. When you make an alloy, you don’t just mix two metals. You make a\nnew one.\n“That’s a fundamental of Allomancy, you see. Steel is just iron with a\npinch of carbon in it, but that makes all the difference. This aluminum has\nsomething else in it too—less than one percent. I think it might be\nekaboron, but that’s really just a hunch. A little pinch. It works for men too,\noddly. A tiny change can result in creating an entirely new person. How like\nmetals we are.…” He shook his head, then waved for her to take a seat in a\nchair against the wall. “But you didn’t come to hear me blather. Come, tell\nme, what can I do for you?”\n“It’s actually what I can do for you,” she said, sitting. “I’ve spoken to\nLord Harms. I thought that because of your … Well, because House Ladrian\nis currently lacking in liquid assets, you see, I thought that you may not\nhave the tools you need to seek Lady Steris. Lord Harms has agreed to\nbankroll you for whatever you need as you pursue her rescue.”\nWaxillium seemed surprised. “That’s wonderful. Thank you.” He paused,\nthen looked at his desk. “Do you think he’d mind paying for this…?”\n“Not at all,” she said quickly.\n“Well, that’s a relief. Tillaume nearly fainted when he saw what I’d spent.\nI think the old man’s afraid we’ll run out of tea if I keep this up. It’s so\nincredible that I can be the source of employment for some twenty thousand\npeople, own two to three percent of the land in the city, and yet still be so\npoor in ready cash. What an odd world business is.” Waxillium leaned\nforward, clasping his hands, looking thoughtful. In the light of the open\nwindow, she could now see that he had bags under his eyes.\n“My lord?” she asked. “Have you slept at all since the kidnapping?”\nHe didn’t reply.\n“Lord Waxillium,” she said sternly. “You mustn’t neglect your own well-\nbeing. Running yourself to rust will do no good for anyone.”\n“Lady Steris was taken on my watch, Marasi,” he said softly. “I didn’t lift\na finger. I had to be goaded into it.” He shook his head, as if to drive away"

I had to be goaded into it.” He shook his head, as if to drive away\nbad thoughts. “But you needn’t worry about me. I wouldn’t have been able\nto sleep anyway, so I might as well be productive.”\n“Have you come to any conclusions?” she asked, genuinely curious.\n“Too many,” he said. “Often, the problem is not coming up with solutions\n—it’s deciding which of them actually happened and which are pure fancy.\nThose men, for instance. They weren’t professionals.” He paused. “I’m\nsorry, that probably doesn’t make any sense.”\n“No, it does,” she said. “The way they kept itching to shoot the building\nup, they way their boss let himself be goaded into shooting Peterus…”\n“Exactly,” he said. “They had experience as thieves, certainly. But they\nweren’t refined at it.”\n“A simple way to determine the type of criminal is by whom they kill and\nwhen,” Marasi said, quoting a line from one of her textbooks. “Murders end\nwith a hanging; thievery alone can mean escaping death. Those men, if\nthey’d really known what they were doing, would have left quickly, glad\nthey hadn’t needed to do any shooting.”\n“So they’re street toughs,” Waxillium said. “Common criminals.”\n“With very expensive weapons,” Marasi said, frowning. “Which implies\nan outside backer, doesn’t it?”\n“Yes,” Waxillium said, growing eager and leaning in. “At first, I was very\nconfused. I was convinced this was all about the kidnappings, the thievery\njust a front to disguise that. Then the men last night were genuinely\ninterested in what they were taking. It baffled me. Judging by the price of\naluminum, and how much they had to spend forging those guns, they’ve\nspent a fortune to make a lesser amount from last night’s robbery. It didn’t\nmake sense.”\n“Unless we’re dealing with two groups working together,” Marasi said,\nunderstanding. “Someone has given funds to the bandits, allowing them to\npull off these robberies. The backing group, however, demands that they\nkidnap certain people, making it seem like the result of random hostage-\ntakings.”\n“Yes! He—whoever the backer is—wants the kidnapped women. And the\nVanishers, they get to keep whatever they steal, or perhaps a percentage of\nit. It is all meant to use the robberies as a cover-up, but it’s possible the\nbandits themselves don’t understand how they’re being used.”\nMarasi frowned, biting her lip. “But that means…”\n“What?”\n“Well, I’d hoped that this was mostly over with,” she explained. “Your\ninitial count of the thieves was just under forty, and you and Wayne killed\nor incapacitated thirty or so of them.”\n“Thirty-one,” he said absently.\n“I had assumed those remaining might cut their losses and flee. Killing\nthree-quarters of a group should be enough to disband them, one would\nthink.”\n“It would, in my experience.”\n“But this is different,” she said. “The bandit boss has an outside backer\noffering wealth and weaponry.” She frowned. “The boss spoke of"

Could he be both the boss and the backer?”\n“Perhaps,” Waxillium said. “But I doubt it. Part of the point of all this\nwould be to have someone else doing the dangerous work for you.”\n“Agreed,” she said. “But the boss does seem to have his own ideology.\nPerhaps he was chosen because of it. Criminals often use basic\nrationalization skills to justify what they are doing, and a man who could\ncapitalize on that—along with promising riches and lots of fun shooting\nthings—would be ideal as a ‘middle manager,’ so to speak.”\nWaxillium smiled broadly.\n“What?” she asked.\n“You realize I spent all night coming to those conclusions? You just\nreached them in all of … what? Ten minutes?”\nShe sniffed. “I had some modest help from you.”\n“It might be said that I had modest help from myself, technically.”\n“The voices whispering to you as a result of sleep deprivation do not\ncount, my lord.”\nHis smile grew, and then he stood. “Come. Tell me what you make of\nthis.”\nCurious, she followed him to the front of the room, where she’d noticed\nthe heap of paper. He pulled it straight, revealing a long—perhaps five-foot\n—piece of paper that was several feet wide. Waxillium knelt on the ground,\nbut she had a harder time, being in skirts. So she just bent down, looking\nover his shoulder.\n“Genealogies?” she asked, surprised. It appeared that he’d traced each of\nthe kidnapped women back to the Origin, starting with their names at the\nleft of the long sheet, then working backward. It didn’t list every relative,\nbut it included the direct ancestors and a few notable names in each\ngeneration for each hostage.\n“Well?” he asked.\n“I’m beginning to suspect that you are an odd man, my lord,” she said.\n“You spent all night doing this?”\n“It did take a great deal of my time, though Wayne’s paper gave me a\ngood head start. Fortunately, my uncle’s library had extensive genealogical\nresources. It was a hobby of his. But what do you think?”\n“That it is a good thing you’re soon to be engaged, for a good wife would\nhave seen that you got your rest, rather than writing all night by candlelight.\nThat’s bad for your eyes, you know.”\n“We have electricity,” he said, waving upward. “Besides, I doubt Steris\nwill care about my sleeping habits. It’s not in the contract, you see.” There\nwas a touch of bitterness in his tone—faint, but recognizable.\nShe’d said most of that to stall him for a few moments so she could read\nmore of the names. “Allomancers,” she said. “You analyzed the family lines\nfor Allomantic powers in their heritage. They all converge on the Lord\nMistborn. Didn’t Wayne speak of this?”\n“Yes,” he said. “I believe that the one behind all this is looking for\nAllomancers. He’s building an army. He picks the people he does because"

He picks the people he does because\nhe suspects that they’re secretly Allomancers. The fact that they aren’t open\nabout it makes it harder to recognize what he’s doing.”\n“But Steris isn’t an Allomancer. I promise it.”\n“That worried me for a time,” he said. “But it’s not a large issue. See,\nhe’s picking people he thinks are probably Allomancers, but he’s bound to\nget it wrong a few times.” Waxillium tapped the paper. “That does make me\nworry for her. Once the backer discovers that she’s not what he thought she\nwas, she’ll be in greater danger.”\nHence why you stayed up all night, she realized. You think there isn’t\ntime.\nAll of this, for a woman he obviously didn’t love. It was difficult not to\nbe jealous.\nWhat? she thought. You’d have had yourself be taken? Foolish girl.\nShe did note that her own name was one of those listed. “You have my\ngenealogy?” she said, surprised.\n“Had to send out for it,” he said. “Made some clerks quite angry in the\nmiddle of the night, I’m afraid. You’re very odd.”\n“Excuse me?”\n“Oh. Um, I mean on the list. You see here? You’re second cousins with\nSteris.”\n“And?”\n“And, that means you’re … well, this is awkward to explain. You’re,\nessentially, a sixth cousin to the main bloodline here. All of the others,\nincluding Steris, were much better connected—you have bloodlines on your\nfather’s side that dilute your connections. That makes you an odd target,\ncompared to the others. I’m wondering if they picked you because they\nwanted to take someone random to break up their pattern and keep us\nguessing.”\n“Possible,” she said carefully. “They didn’t know Steris had been sitting\nwith us, after all.”\n“Very true. But … here’s where it gets speculative. You see? I can come\nup with plenty of reasons why Steris was targeted. The history of\nAllomancers isn’t the only connection—because of the propinquity of high\nsociety, there are many other connections.\n“In fact, as I look at it, the Allomancy factor is tenuous. If you’re going\nto train fighters, why take only women? Why bother with Allomancers in\nthe first place, when you have the funds and means to steal all of this\naluminum? They could have stopped there and been rich. And I can’t find\nanything to indicate, with certitude, that the other women taken were indeed\nAllomancers.”\nThey’re taking just women, Marasi thought, looking at the long lists,\ntying back to the Lord Mistborn. The most powerful Allomancer who ever\nlived. A nearly mythological figure, someone who had all sixteen\nAllomantic powers in one body. How powerful would he have been?\nAnd suddenly, it made sense. “Rust and Ruin,” she whispered.\nWaxillium looked up at her. He’d probably have seen it, if he hadn’t\npushed himself so long through the night."

He’d probably have seen it, if he hadn’t\npushed himself so long through the night.\n“Allomancy is genetic,” she said.\n“Yes. Which is why it shows up so much in these lines.”\n“Genetic. Taking all women. Waxillium, don’t you see? They’re not\nintending to build an army of Allomancers. They’re intending to breed one.\nThey’re taking the women with the most direct Allomantic lines back to the\nMistborn.”\nWaxillium stared at his large paper, then blinked. “By the Survivor’s\nspear…” he whispered. “Well, at least this means Steris isn’t in immediate\ndanger. She’s valuable to him even without being an Allomancer.”\n“Yes,” Marasi said, feeling sick. “But if I’m right, then she’ll be in a\ndifferent kind of danger.”\n“Indeed,” Waxillium said, subdued. “I should have seen this. Wayne will\nnever let me live it down, once he finds out.”\n“Wayne,” she said, realizing she hadn’t asked after him. “Where is he?”\nWaxillium checked his pocket watch. “He should be back soon. I sent\nhim out to cause a little mischief.”\n8\nWayne strode up the steps into the Fourth Octant constabulary precinct\noffices. His ears felt way too hot. Why was it that conners wore such\nuncomfortable hats? Maybe that was why they were so grouchy all the time\n—walking about the city, picking on respectable folk. Even after just a few\nweeks in Elendel, Wayne knew that was basically what constables did.\nBad hats. A bad hat could make a man right disagreeable, and that was\nthe truth.\nHe burst through the double doors, slamming them open. The room\ninside basically looked like a big cage. A wooden railing in the front to keep\npeople separated from the conners, desks behind for eating food or lounging\nand talking. His entrance caused a few of the brown-uniformed conners to\nsit bolt upright, some reaching for revolvers at their hips.\n“Who’s in charge of this place!” Wayne bellowed.\nThe astounded conners stared at him, then jumped to their feet,\nstraightening uniforms and hastily sticking on their hats. He wore one of\nthose uniforms himself. He’d traded for it at a precinct up in the Seventh\nOctant. He’d left a right good shirt as a replacement, as fair a trade as any\nman could ask. After all, that shirt had been silk.\n“Sir!” one of the conners said. “You’ll want Captain Brettin, sir!”\n“Well where the hell is he?” Wayne yelled. He’d picked up the right\naccent from listening to just a few conners. People, they misunderstood the\nword “accent.” They thought accents were those things everybody else had.\nBut that wasn’t it at all. Every person had an individual accent, a blend of\nwhere he’d lived, what he did for a living, who his friends were.\nPeople thought Wayne imitated accents. He didn’t. He outright stole\nthem. They were the only things he was still allowed to steal, seeing as to\nhow he’d turned to doing good with his life and stuff like that."

They were the only things he was still allowed to steal, seeing as to\nhow he’d turned to doing good with his life and stuff like that.\nSeveral of the conners, still confused by his arrival, pointed toward a\ndoor at the side of the room. Others saluted, as if that were really the only\nthing they knew how to do. Wayne huffed through his thick, drooping fake\nmustache and stalked over to the door.\nHe acted as if he were just going to throw it open, but then pretended to\nhesitate and knocked instead.\nBrettin would outrank him, barely. Really unfortunate, Wayne thought.\nHere I am, twenty-five years as a constable, and still only a three-bar. He\nshould have been promoted ages ago.\nAs he raised his hand to knock on the door again, it flew open, revealing\nBrettin’s lean face. He looked annoyed. “What is this racket and yelling—”\nHe froze as he saw Wayne. “Who are you?”\n“Captain Guffon Trenchant,” Wayne said. “Seventh Octant.”\nBrettin’s eyes flicked to Wayne’s insignia, then back to his face. There\nwas a moment of confusion, and Wayne could see panic in Brettin’s eyes.\nHe was trying to decide if he should remember Captain Guffon or not. The\nCity was a big place, and—from what Wayne had overheard—Brettin was\nalways mixing up people’s names.\n“I … of course, Captain,” Brettin said. “Have … er, we met?”\nWayne blew out his mustaches. “We sat at the same table at the\nchairman’s dinner last spring!” He was feeling pretty good about this\naccent. It was a mixture of seventh-son lord and foreman of an ironworks,\nwith just a hint of canal captain. Speaking with it felt like he’d stuffed\ncotton in half of his mouth and had borrowed the voice from an angry dog.\nBut he’d spent weeks in the city now, listening in pubs in different\noctants, visiting the railway tracks, chatting with people in parks. He’d\ncollected a good number of accents, adding them to the ones he’d already\nstolen. Even when living in Weathering, he’d taken trips to the city to gather\naccents. You found the best ones here.\n“I … oh, of course,” Brettin said. “Yes. Trenchant, I recognize you now.\nIt has been a while.”\n“Never mind that,” Wayne blustered. “What’s this about you having\nprisoners from the Vanishers Gang? Good steel, man! We had to learn about\nit from the broadsheets!”\n“We have jurisdiction here, as the event—” Brettin hesitated, looking at\nthe room full of intrigued constables studiously pretending not to be\nlistening. “Step inside.”\nWayne eyed the watching men. Not a one of them had questioned him.\nAct like you were important, act like you were angry, and people just\nwanted to get out of your way. Basic psychology, that was. “Very well,” he\nsaid.\nBrettin closed the door, speaking quickly and authoritatively. “They were\ncaptured in our octant and the crime they were committing was here. We"

I did send you all a missive.”\n“A missive? Rust and Ruin, man! You know how many of those we get a\nday?”\n“Well perhaps you should hire someone to sort through them,” Brettin\nsaid testily. “That’s what I eventually did.”\nWayne blew out his mustache. “Well, you could have sent someone over\nto inform us,” he said lamely.\n“Next time, perhaps,” Brettin said, sounding satisfied for having won the\nargument and disarmed an angry rival. “We are rather busy with those\nprisoners.”\n“Well and good,” Wayne said. “When are you sending them to us?”\n“What?” Brettin said.\n“We have prior claim! You have jurisdiction for the initial inquest, but we\nhave prosecution rights. First robbery happened in our octant.” Wax had\nwritten that out for him. Bloke could be right useful, on occasion.\n“You have to give us a written request for that!”\n“We sent a missive,” Wayne said.\nBrettin hesitated.\n“Earlier today,” Wayne said. “You didn’t get it?”\n“Er … We get a lot of missives…”\n“Thought you said you hired someone to read them.”\n“Sent him out for scones earlier, you see…”\n“Ah. Well then.” Wayne hesitated. “Can I have one?”\n“Of the scones or the prisoners?”\nWayne leaned in. “Look, Brettin, let’s melt this down and forge it. We\nboth know you can stall for months with those prisoners while we complete\nproper transfer paperwork. That is basically worthless to both of us. You get\na lot of hassle, and we lose any chance we had of catching the rest of these\nfellows. We need to move quick.”\n“And?” Brettin asked, suspicious.\n“I want to question a few of the prisoners,” Wayne said. “Chief sent me\nspecifically. You let me in, give me a few minutes, and we’ll stop all\ntransfer requests. You can prosecute, but we get to keep hunting for their\nboss.”\nThe two locked gazes. According to Wax, prosecuting the Vanishers\nwould be good for careers—very good. But the real prize, the boss of the\ngang, was still at large. Getting him would mean glory, promotions, and\nmaybe an invitation to join the upper crust. The late Lord Peterus himself\nhad done it, when he’d captured the Copper Strangler.\nLetting a rival constable interview the prisoners would be risky.\nPotentially losing the prisoners completely—as Brettin chanced doing—\nwas even more so.\n“How long?” Brettin said.\n“Fifteen minutes each,” Wayne said.\nBrettin’s eyes narrowed just slightly. “Ten minutes with two of the\nprisoners.”\n“Fine,” Wayne said. “Let’s do it.”\nIt took longer to set things up than it should have. Constables tended to\ntake their time about anything unless it involved burning buildings or\nmurders in the streets—and they ran for those two only if someone rich was\ninvolved.

Trying to shoot Wayne was like bringing\ndice to a card game. What was the world coming to?\n“Has he said anything so far?” Wayne asked Brettin and several of his\nminions, standing outside the door and looking in at the tubby, scraggly-\nhaired bandit. He had his arm in a dirty sling.\n“Not much,” Brettin said. “Actually, none of them have given us much of\nanything. They seem…”\n“Afraid,” one of the other constables said. “They’re afraid of something\n—or, at least, more afraid of talking than they are of us.”\n“Bah,” Wayne said. “You just need to be firm with them! No coddling.”\n“We haven’t been—” the constable began, but Brettin raised a hand to\nquiet him. “Your time is slipping away, Captain.”\nWayne sniffed, then sauntered into the room. It was small, practically a\ncloset, with only the one door. Brettin and the others left it open. The bandit\nsat in a chair, manacled hands linked by chains to his feet and both locked\nto the floor. There was a table between them.\nThe bandit watched him resentfully. He didn’t seem to recognize Wayne.\nIt was probably the hat.\n“So, son,” Wayne said. “You’re in a heap of trouble.”\nThe bandit didn’t reply.\n“I can get you off easy. No hangman’s noose for you, if you are willing to\nbe smart.”\nThe bandit spat at him.\nWayne leaned in, hands on the table. “Here now,” he said very softly,\nchanging his speech to the natural, fluid accent that the bandits had been\nusing. A cup of canal worker for authenticity, a healthy dose of bartender\nfor trust, and the rest Sixth Octant, north side, where most had sounded like\nthey’d come from. “Is that the way to speak to the bloke who killed a\nconner and took his uniform, all to get you outta here, mate?”\nThe bandit’s eyes opened wide.\n“Don’t do that, now,” Wayne said softly. “You’re looking too eager.\nThat’ll make ’em suspicious. Damn it all. You’re gonna have to spit on me\nagain.”\nThe man hesitated.\n“Do it!”\nHe spat.\n“Ruination!” Wayne bellowed, swapping back to the constable accent. He\npounded the table. “I’ll tear your ears off, boy, if you do that again.”\nThe bandit looked at him. “Er … should I?”\nAh, good. Got the right neighborhood. “Like hell,” Wayne hissed. “I\nreally will rip yer ears off if you do.” He leaned in, speaking in the street-\ntough accent, low enough so those outside couldn’t hear. “The conners say"

Good job on that. The boss’ll be pleased.”\n“You’re gonna get me out?”\n“What do you think? Can’t leave you to sing. It’s either get you out or see\nyou shaking hands with Ironeyes.”\n“I won’t talk,” the man said urgently. “No need to kill me. I won’t talk.”\n“And the others?”\nThe man hesitated. “I don’t think they will either. Except maybe Sindren.\nHe’s new, and all.”\nGood, Wayne thought. “Sindren. Blond fellow, with the scar?”\n“No. He’s the short guy. Big ears.” The robber squinted at Wayne. “Why\ndon’t I recognize you?”\n“Why do you think?” Wayne said, standing back and resuming his\nconstable voice. “Now, no more griping! Where is your base of operations?\nWhere are you men working from? I want answers!” He leaned in again.\n“You don’t recognize me because I’m too valuable to be seen by the\ncommon men. They might give me away. I work with your boss. Tarson.”\n“Tarson? He’s not boss of anything. He just hits stuff.”\nAlso good. “I meant his boss.”\nThe bandit frowned. He was growing more suspicious.\n“Your attitude is going to get you hanged, mate,” Wayne said softly.\n“Who recruited you? I want to … speak with him.”\n“Who … Clamps does all the recruitment. You should know that.” His\neyes grew hostile.\nExcellent, Wayne thought. “Done!” he said, turning around. “This one\nwon’t talk. Closed-mouthed git.” He walked out of the room to join Brettin\nand the others.\n“Why were you whispering so much?” Brettin demanded. “You said we\ncould listen.”\n“I said you could listen,” Wayne said, “but not that I’d say anything you\ncould hear. You’ve got to speak low and threateningly with these types.\nHave any of the men given you names, yet?”\n“Aliases,” Brettin said, dissatisfied.\n“Any of them give the name Sindren?”\nBrettin looked at his men. They shook their heads.\nExcellent. “I want to see the other men. I’m going to pick which one to\ninterview next.”\n“That wasn’t part of the deal,” Brettin said.\n“And I can still march on home and start up paperwork for a transfer…”\nBrettin stewed for a moment, then led Wayne to the cells. Sindren was\neasy to pick out. The large-eared man looked young; he was wide-eyed as\nhe watched the conners look into his cell.\n“Him,” Wayne said. “Let’s go.”\nThey grabbed him and brought him to an interrogation room. Once\nSindren was chained down, Brettin and his men waited in the room.\n“A little space to breathe, please,” Wayne said, glaring at them.\n“Fine,” Brettin said. “But no more whispering. I want to hear what you\nhave to ask him. He is still our prisoner.”\nWayne glared at them, and they shuffled out, but left the door open."

He is still our prisoner.”\nWayne glared at them, and they shuffled out, but left the door open.\nBrettin stood outside with his arms folded, looking at Wayne expectantly.\nAll right then, Wayne thought. He turned to the captive and leaned in.\n“Hello, Sindren.”\nThe boy actually jumped. “How do you—”\n“Clamps sent me,” Wayne said softly in a street-tough accent. “I’m\nworking on a way to get you out. I need you to remain perfectly still.”\n“But—”\n“Still. Don’t move.”\n“No whispering!” Brettin called in. “If you say—”\nWayne put up a speed bubble. It wasn’t going to last long; he hadn’t been\nable to scrounge up much bendalloy. He’d have to make it work.\n“I’m an Allomancer,” Wayne said, holding perfectly still. “I’ve sped up\ntime for us. If you move, they’ll notice the blur and know what happened.\nDo you understand? Don’t nod yes. Just say so.”\n“Um … yes.”\n“Good,” Wayne said. “As I said, Clamps sent me, and I’m here to get you\nout. Seems the boss worries you fellows will talk.”\n“I won’t!” the youth said, voice nearly a squeak as he obviously worked\nhard to keep himself from moving.\n“I’m sure you won’t,” Wayne said, moving his accent subtly to match the\narea this youth was from, Inner Seventh. He tossed in a sprinkle of\nmillworker, which he caught in this lad’s dialect. Probably from his father.\n“If you did, Tarson would have to break some of your bones. You know\nhow he likes that, eh?”\nThe boy started to nod, but caught himself. “I know.”\n“But we’ll get you out,” Wayne said. “Don’t worry. I don’t recognize\nyou. You new?”\n“Yes.”\n“Clamps recruited you?”\n“Just two weeks back.”\n“Which base were you working out of?”\n“Which one?” the lad said, frowning.\n“We have several stations of operation,” Wayne said. “But of course you\ndon’t know that, do you? The boss only shows one to new kids, in case they\nget caught. Wouldn’t want you to accidentally lead people to us, eh?”\n“That would be awful,” Sindren agreed. He eyed the door, but kept\nhimself still. “He put me in the old foundry over in Longard. I thought we\nwere the only ones!”\n“That’s the idea,” Wayne said. “We can’t let a simple mistake stop us\nfrom getting payback.”\n“Er, yes.”\n“You don’t believe in all that, do you?” Wayne said. “It’s okay. I think the\nboss gets a little crazy with that stuff too.”\n“Yeah,” the youth said. “I mean, most of us just want the money, you\nknow? Payback’s nice. But…”\n“… money’s better.”\n“Yeah. Boss is always talking about how things will be better when he’s\nin charge, and how the city betrayed him, and stuff. But the city betrays\neveryone. That’s how life is.” The youth glanced again at the constables\noutside the door.\n“Don’t worry,” Wayne said. “They think I’m one of them.”"

Surprising how many people never\nfigure that out. You’re sure they never told you about any of the other\nbases? I need to know which ones are in danger.”\n“No,” the youth said. “I only ever went to the foundry. Stayed there\npretty much all the time, except when we went out on runs.”\n“Can I give you some advice, son?” Wayne asked.\n“Please.”\n“Get out of this business of robbing folks. You aren’t meant for it. If you\never do get free, go back to the mills.”\nThe boy frowned.\n“Takes a special type to be a proper criminal,” Wayne explained. “You\nain’t that type. You see, in this conversation, I tricked you into confirming\nthe name of the guy who recruited you and giving the location of your\nbase.”\nThe youth grew pale. “But…”\n“Don’t worry,” Wayne said. “I’m on your side, remember? You’re just\nlucky that I am.”\n“Yeah.”\n“All right,” Wayne said, lowering his voice, remaining still. “I don’t\nknow if I can get you out by force. Face it, kid, you’re not worth it. But I\ncan help you. I want you to talk to the constables.”\n“What?”\n“Give me until evening,” Wayne said. “I’ll go back to the base and clear\nthe place out. Once that’s done, you can sing to the conners, tell them\neverything you know. Don’t worry, you weren’t told enough to get us into\nreal trouble. Our contingency plans will protect us. I’ll tell the boss I told\nyou to do it, and so you’ll be all right.\n“But don’t talk to them until they promise to let you go free in return. Get\na solicitor into the room; ask for one by the name of Arintol. He’s supposed\nto be honest.” At least, that was what people on the streets had told Wayne.\n“Get the conners to promise you freedom with Arintol in the room. Then,\ntell them everything you know.\n“Once you’re out, get away from the City. Some of the gang may not\nbelieve that I told you to talk, so it could be dangerous for you. Go to the\nRoughs and become a millworker. Nobody will care, there. Either way, kid,\nstay out of crime. You’ll just end up getting someone killed. Maybe you.”\n“I…” The youth looked relieved. “Thank you.”\nWayne winked. “Now, resist everything I ask you from here out.” He\nstarted coughing and dropped the speed bubble.\n“—that I can’t hear,” Brettin said, “I’m stopping this right here.”\n“Fine!” Wayne yelled. “Boy, tell me who you work for.”\n“I ain’t giving you anything, conner!”\n“You’ll talk, or I’ll have your toes!” Wayne yelled back.\nThe kid got into it, and Wayne gave the constables a good five minutes of\narguing before throwing up his hands and storming out.\n“I told you,” Brettin said."

Excellent! At least this trip won’t be a complete waste.”\n9\n“So we aren’t sure yet what happened,” Waxillium said, sitting on the floor\nbeside the long sheet of paper covered with his genealogical results. “The\nWords of Founding included a reference to two more metals and their\nalloys. But the ancients believed in sixteen metals, and the Law of Sixteen\nholds so strongly in nature that it can’t be disregarded. Either Harmony\nchanged the way that Allomancy itself works, or we never really understood\nit.”\n“Hmmm,” Marasi said, sitting on the floor with her knees to the side. “I\nwould not have expected that from you, Lord Waxillium. Lawman I had\nanticipated. Metallurgist, perhaps. But philosopher?”\n“There is a link between being a lawman and a philosopher,” Waxillium\nsaid, smiling idly. “Lawkeeping and philosophy are both about questions. I\nwas drawn to law by a need to find the answers nobody else could, to\ncapture the men everyone considered uncatchable. Philosophy is similar.\nQuestions, secrets, puzzles. The human mind and the nature of the universe\n—the two great riddles of time.”\nShe nodded thoughtfully.\n“What was it for you?” Waxillium asked. “One does not often meet a\nyoung woman of means studying law.”\n“My means are not so … meaningful as they may seem at first,” she said.\n“I would be nothing without my uncle’s patronage.”\n“Still.”\n“Stories,” she said, smiling wistfully. “Stories of the good and the evil.\nMost people you meet, they aren’t quite either one.”\nWaxillium frowned. “I’d disagree. Most people seem basically good.”\n“Well, perhaps by one definition. But it seems that either one—good or\nevil—has to be pursued for it to be significant. People today … it seems\nthey are good, or sometimes evil, mostly by inertia, not by choice. They act\nas their surroundings prepare them to act.\n“It’s like … well, think of a world where everything is lit with the same\nmodest light. All places, outside or inside, lit by a uniform light that cannot\nbe changed. If, in this world of common light, someone suddenly produced\na light that was significantly brighter, it would be remarkable. By the same\ntoken, if someone managed to create a room that was dim, it would be\nremarkable. In a way, it doesn’t matter how strong the initial illumination\nwas. The story works regardless.”\n“The fact that most people are decent does not make their decency any\nless valuable to society.”\n“Yes, yes,” she said, blushing. “And I’m not saying I wish that everyone\nwere less decent. But … those bright lights and those dim places fascinate"

But … those bright lights and those dim places fascinate\nme, Lord Waxillium—particularly when they’re dramatically out of order.\nWhy is it that in one instance, a man raised in a basically good family—\nsurrounded by basically good friends, with good employment and\nsatisfactory means—starts strangling women with copper wires and sinking\ntheir bodies in the canals?\n“And conversely, consider that most men who go to the Roughs adapt to\nthe general climate of lax sensibilities there. But some others—a few\nremarkable individuals—determine to bring civilization with them. A\nhundred men, convinced by society that ‘everybody does it this way,’ will\ngo along with the most crude and despicable of acts. But one man says no.”\n“It’s really not as heroic as all that,” Waxillium said.\n“I’m certain it doesn’t look that way to you.”\n“Have you ever heard the story of the first man I brought in?”\nShe blushed. “I … yes. Yes, let’s just say that I’ve heard it. Peret the\nBlack. A rapist and an Allomancer—Pewterarm, I believe. You walked into\nthe lawkeeper station, looked at the board, ripped his picture off and took it\nwith you. Came back three days later with him over the saddle of your\nhorse. Of all the men on the board, you picked the most difficult, most\ndangerous criminal of the bunch.”\n“He was worth the most money.”\nMarasi frowned.\n“I looked at that board,” Waxillium said, “and I thought to myself, ‘Well,\nany of these blokes is right likely to kill me. So I might as well pick the one\nworth the most.’ I needed the money. I hadn’t had anything to eat in three\ndays but jerky and a few beans. And then there was Taraco.”\n“One of the great bandits of our era.”\n“With him,” Waxillium said, “I figured I could get some new boots. He’d\nrobbed a cobbler just a few days earlier, and I thought if I brought the man\nin, I might manage to get a new pair of boots out of it.”\n“I thought you’d picked him because he’d shot a lawkeeper over in\nFaradana the week before.”\nWaxillium shook his head. “I didn’t hear that until after I brought him\nin.”\n“Oh.” Then, remarkably, she smiled in eagerness. “And Harrisel Hard?”\n“A bet with Wayne,” Waxillium said. “You don’t look disappointed.”\n“This just makes it more real, Lord Waxillium,” she said. Her eager eyes\nglittered in an almost predatory way. “I need to write these down.” She\nfished in her handbag, pulling out a pad and pencil.\n“So that’s what motivated you?” Waxillium asked as she scribbled notes.\n“You study out of a desire to be a hero, like in the stories?”\n“No, no,” she said. “I just wanted to learn about them.”\n“Are you sure?” he said. “You could become a lawkeeper, go out to the\nRoughs, live these same stories.

Don’t think that you can’t because you’re a\nwoman; high society might lead you to believe that, but it doesn’t matter\nout beyond the mountains. Out there, you don’t have to wear lacy dresses or\nsmell like flowers. You can belt on some revolvers and make your own\nrules. Don’t forget, the Ascendant Warrior herself was a woman.”\nShe leaned forward. “Can I admit something to you, Lord Waxillium?”\n“Only if it’s salacious, personal, or embarrassing.”\nShe smiled. “I like the lacy dresses and smelling like flowers. I like living\nin the city, where I can demand modern conveniences. Do you realize I can\nsend for Terris food at any hour of the night, and have it delivered?”\n“Incredible.” It actually was. He hadn’t realized that was possible.\n“As much as I like reading about the Roughs, and though I may like to\nvisit, I don’t think I’d take well to living there. I don’t mix well with dirt,\ngrime, and an overall lack of personal hygiene.” She leaned in. “And, to be\nperfectly honest, I have no problem at all letting men like you be the ones to\nbelt on revolvers and shoot people. Does that make me a terrible traitor to\nmy sex?”\n“I don’t think so. You are pretty good at shooting things, though.”\n“Well, shooting things is okay. But people?” She shivered. “I know the\nAscendant Warrior is a model for self-actualized women. We have classes\non it at the university, for Preservation’s sake, and her legacy is written into\nthe law. But I don’t really want to put on trousers and be her. I feel like a\ncoward for admitting it sometimes.”\n“It’s all right,” he said. “You have to be yourself. But none of that\nexplains why you are studying law.”\n“Oh, I do want to change the city,” she said, growing eager. “Though I\nfeel that tracking down every criminal and punching holes in them with\npieces of metal moving at high speeds is a terribly inefficient way to do it.”\n“Sure can be fun, though.”\n“Let me show you something.” She dug in her handbag a little more, and\ncame out with some folded-up sheets of paper. “I spoke of how people\ngenerally act in response to their surroundings. Remember our discussion\nabout the Roughs, and how there are often more lawkeepers per person\nthere than here? And yet, crime is more prevalent. That’s the result of\nenvironment. Look here.”\nShe handed over some of the pages. “This is a report,” she said. “I’m\nputting it together myself. It’s about the nature of crime as related to\nenvironment. See here, this discusses the major factors that have decreased\ncrime in some sections of the city. Hiring more constables, hanging more\ncriminals, that sort of thing. They are of medium efficacy.”\n“What’s this at the bottom?” Waxillium asked.\n“Renovation,” she said with a deep smile. “This case is where a wealthy\nman, Lord Joshin himself, purchased several parcels of land in one of the\nless reputable areas. He began renovating and cleaning up. Crime went way"

The people didn’t change, just their environment. Now that area is a\nsafe and respectable section of the city.\n“We call it the ‘broken windows’ theory. If a man sees a broken window\nin a building, he’s more likely to rob or commit other crimes, since he\nfigures nobody cares. If all the windows are maintained, all the streets\nclean, all the buildings washed, then crime goes down. Just as a hot day can\nmake a person irritable, it appears that a run-down area can make an\nordinary man into a criminal.”\n“Curious,” Waxillium said.\n“Of course,” she said, “this isn’t the only answer. There will always be\npeople who don’t respond to their surroundings. They fascinate me, as I’ve\nmentioned. Anyway, I’ve always been good with numbers and figures. I see\npatterns like this and wonder. Cleaning up a few streets can be cheaper than\nemploying more constables—but can actually decrease crime to a greater\ndegree.”\nWaxillium looked over the reports, then back at Marasi. She had a flush\nof excitement in her cheeks. There was something captivating about her.\nHow long had they been here? He hesitated, then pulled out his pocket\nwatch.\n“Oh,” she said, glancing at the watch. “We shouldn’t be chatting like this.\nNot with poor Steris in their hands.”\n“We can’t do more until Wayne returns,” Waxillium said. “In fact, he\nshould have been back by now.”\n“He is,” Wayne’s voice said from the hallway outside.\nMarasi jumped, letting out a faint yelp.\nWaxillium sighed. “How long have you been out there?”\nWayne’s head poked around the corner, wearing a constable’s hat. “Oh, a\nlittle while. Seemed like you two were having some kind of ‘smart people’\nmoment. Didn’t want to interfere.”\n“Wise of you. Your stupidity can be infectious.”\n“Don’t use your fancy words ’round me, son.” Wayne strolled in. Though\nhe wore the constable’s hat, he was otherwise normally dressed in his duster\nand trousers, dueling canes at his hips.\n“Did you succeed?” Waxillium asked, standing up, then reaching down to\nhelp Marasi to her feet.\n“Sure did—I got some scones.” Wayne grinned. “And the dirty conners\neven paid for them.”\n“Wayne?”\n“Yes?”\n“We’re dirty conners.”\n“Not no more,” he said proudly. “We’re independent citizens with a mind\ntoward civic duty. And eating the scones of dirty conners.”\nMarasi grimaced. “They don’t sound that appetizing when described that\nway.”\n“Oh, they were good.” Wayne reached into the pocket of his duster.\n“Here, I brought you some. Got a little mushed up in my pocket, though.”\n“No, really,” she said, paling.\nWayne, however, chuckled and brought out a paper that he waved at\nWaxillium. “Location of the Vanishers’ hideout in the city.

Nice work.”\n“We need to get going!” Marasi said, urgent. “Go there, get Steris, and\n—”\n“They won’t be there anymore,” Waxillium said, taking the paper. “Not\nafter having several of their members captured. Wayne, did you manage to\nget this without the constables hearing?”\nHe looked offended. “What do you think?”\nWaxillium nodded, rubbing his chin. “We should probably go soon. Get\nto the scene before it gets too cold.”\n“But…” Marasi said. “The constables…”\n“We’ll drop them an anonymous tip once I’ve seen the place,” Waxillium\nsaid.\n“Won’t be needed,” Wayne added. “I set a fuse.”\n“For when?”\n“Nightfall.”\n“Nice.”\n“You can show your appreciation with a big fat nugget of a rare and\nexpensive metal,” Wayne said.\n“On the desk,” Waxillium said, folding the paper and sliding it into his\nvest pocket.\nWayne walked over, glancing at the apparatus set up on the desk. “I’m\nnot sure if I want to touch any of this, mate. I’m rather fond of all of my\nfingers.”\n“It’s not going to explode, Wayne,” he said dryly.\n“You said that—”\n“It happened once,” Waxillium said.\n“Do you know how bloody annoying it is to regrow fingers, Wax?”\n“If it’s on par with your complaining, then it’s likely appalling indeed.”\n“I’m just sayin’,” Wayne said, scanning the desk until he found the bottle\nof bendalloy flakes. He snatched that, then backed away warily. “The most\ninnocent-looking of things have a tendency to explode around you. A bloke\nhas to be cautious.” He shook the bottle. “This isn’t much.”\n“Don’t act spoiled,” Waxillium said. “That’s far more than I could have\ngotten you on short notice if we’d been out in the Roughs.

To the side, Tillaume\nwalked in, carrying a basket in one hand and a tray with tea in the other. He\nset the basket beside the door, then set the tray on the table and began\npouring tea.\nWaxillium eyed Marasi. “You want to come? I thought you said you\nwanted to leave the shooting to men like me.”\n“You said they won’t be there,” she replied. “So there’s really no danger.”\n“They still want you,” Wayne noted. “They tried to grab you at the\ndinner. It’ll be dangerous for you.”\n“And they’d likely shoot either one of you without blinking,” she said.\n“So how will it be any less dangerous for you?”"

There was something he was missing,\nsomething important. Something about what Wayne had said …\n“Why did they take you?” Waxillium asked Marasi. “There were better\ntargets at that party. Women closer to the bloodlines they wanted.”\n“You said she might have been a decoy to throw us off,” Wayne said,\ndumping some bendalloy into his teacup, then downing the entire thing in\none draught.\n“Yes,” Waxillium said, looking into her eyes and seeing a flash of\nsomething there. She turned away. “But if that were the case, they’d have\nwanted to take someone that wasn’t close to the same bloodline at all, not\none who was a near cousin.” He pursed his lips, and then it clicked. “Ah.\nYou’re illegitimate, then. Steris’s half sister, by Lord Harms, I assume.”\nShe blushed. “Yes.”\nWayne whistled. “Wonderful show, Wax. Usually I wait to call someone\na bastard until the second date.” He eyed Marasi. “Third if she’s pretty.”\n“I…” Waxillium felt a sudden burst of shame. “Of course. I didn’t\nmean…”\n“It’s quite all right,” she said softly.\nIt made sense. Marasi and Lord Harms had grown so uncomfortable\nwhen Steris had spoken of mistresses. And then there was the specific\nclause about them in the contract; Steris was accustomed to infidelity on the\npart of a lord. That also explained why Harms was paying for the education\nand housing of Steris’s “cousin.”\n“Lady Marasi,” Waxillium said, taking her hand. “Perhaps my years in\nthe Roughs affected me more than I’d assumed. There was a time when I\ngave thought to my words before speaking them. Forgive me.”\n“I am what I am, Lord Waxillium,” she said. “And I have grown\ncomfortable with it.”\n“It was still crude of me.”\n“You needn’t apologize.”\n“Huh,” Wayne said thoughtfully. “Tea’s poisoned.”\nWith that, he toppled to the ground.\nMarasi gasped, immediately going to his side. Waxillium spun, looking at\nTillaume just as the butler turned from his supposed tea preparations and\nleveled a pistol at Waxillium.\nThere was no time for thought. Waxillium burned steel—he kept it in him\nwhen he thought he might be in danger—and Pushed on the third button of\nhis vest. He always wore one made of steel there, to use either for restoring\nhis metal reserves or as a weapon."

He always wore one made of steel there, to use either for restoring\nhis metal reserves or as a weapon.\nIt burst from his vest, streaking across the room and striking Tillaume in\nthe chest just as he pulled the trigger. The shot went wild. Neither the bullet\nnor the gun registered as metal to Waxillium’s Allomantic senses.\nAluminum, then.\nTillaume stumbled to the side and dropped the gun, pulling himself along\nthe bookshelf in an attempt to flee. He left a line of blood on the floor\nbefore collapsing at the door.\nWaxillium dropped to his knees beside Wayne. Marasi had jumped at the\ngunshot, and was staring at the gasping butler.\n“Wayne?” Waxillium said, lifting his friend’s head.\nWayne’s eyes fluttered open. “Poison. I hate poison. Worse than losin’ a\nfinger, I tell you.”\n“Lord Waxillium!” Marasi said, alarmed.\n“Wayne will be fine,” Waxillium said, relaxing back. “So long as he can\ntalk and he has some Feruchemical reserves, he can pull through just about\nanything.”\n“I’m not talking about him. The butler!”\nWaxillium looked up with a start, realizing that the dying Tillaume was\nfiddling with the basket he’d brought in—the man reached a bloodied hand\ninto it and pulled on something.\n“Wayne!” Waxillium cried. “Bubble. Now!”\nTillaume fell back. The basket erupted in a blossoming ball of fire.\nAnd then froze.\n“Aw, hell,” Wayne said, rolling over to look at the explosion in progress.\n“I warned you. I said things are always blowing up around you.”\n“I refuse to take responsibility for this one.”\n“He’s your butler,” Wayne said, coughing and crawling to his knees.\n“Blarek! It wasn’t even good tea.”\n“It’s getting bigger!” Marasi said, alarmed as she pointed at the\nexplosion.\nThe fire blast had vaporized the basket before Wayne got his bubble up.\nThe blast wave was slowly expanding outward, burning away the carpet,\ndestroying the doorframe and the bookshelves. The butler himself had\nalready been engulfed.\n“Damn,” Wayne said. “That’s a big one.”\n“Probably meant to look like an accident with my metallurgy\nequipment,” Waxillium said. “Burning our bodies, covering the murder.”\n“Shall we go out the windows, then?”\n“That blast is going to be hard to outrun,” Waxillium said thoughtfully.\n“You could do it. Just gotta Push hard enough.”\n“Against what, Wayne? I don’t see any good anchors in that direction.\nBesides, if I launch us backward that fast, going out the window is going to\nshred us and rip our bodies apart.”\n“Gentlemen,” Marasi said, voice growing frantic, “it’s getting bigger.”\n“Wayne can’t stop time,” Waxillium said. “Just slow it greatly. And he\ncan’t move the bubble once he’s made it.”\n“Look,” Wayne said. “Just blow the wall out. Push against the nails in the\nwindow frames and blast open the side of the building. Then you can shoot"

Then you can shoot\nus out that direction without us running into anything.”\n“Do you even listen to yourself when you say these things?” Waxillium\nasked, hands on hips as he regarded his friend. “That’s brick and stone. If I\nPush too hard, I’ll just throw myself backward into the explosion.”\n“It’s getting really, really close!” Marasi said.\n“So make yourself heavier,” Wayne said.\n“Heavy enough so that I don’t move when an entire wall—a well-built,\nextremely heavy one—is ripped off a building?”\n“Sure.”\n“The floor would never be able to take it,” Waxillium said. “It would\nshatter, and…”\nHe trailed off.\nBoth of them looked down.\nSnapping into motion, Waxillium grabbed Marasi, pulling her over with a\nyelp. He rolled onto his back, holding her tightly atop him.\nThe explosion was taking up most of their field of vision now, having\nconsumed a large portion of the room. It swelled closer and closer, glowing\nwith angry yellow light, like a bubbling, bursting pastry expanding in an\nenormous oven.\n“What are we—” Marasi said.\n“Hold on!” Waxillium said.\nHe amplified his weight.\nFeruchemy didn’t work like Allomancy. The two categories of power\nwere often lumped together, but in many ways, they were opposites. In\nAllomancy, the power came from the metal itself, and there was a limit to\nhow much you could do at once. Wayne couldn’t compress time beyond a\ncertain amount; Waxillium could Push only so hard on a piece of metal.\nFeruchemy was powered by a sort of cannibalism, where you consumed\npart of yourself for later use. Make yourself weigh half as much for ten\ndays, and you could make yourself one and a half times as heavy for a near-\nequal amount of time. Or you could make yourself twice as heavy for half\nthat time. Or four times as heavy for a quarter of that time.\nOr extremely heavy for a few brief moments.\nWaxillium drew into himself weight he’d stored in his metalminds across\ndays spent going around at three-quarters weight. He became heavy as a\nboulder, then as heavy as a building, then heavier. All this weight was\nfocused on one small section of the floor.\nThe wood crunched, then burst, exploding downward. Waxillium\ndropped out of Wayne’s bubble of speed and hit real time, the shift jostling\nhim. The next few moments were a blur. He heard the awesome sound of\nthe explosion above—it hit with a wave of force. He released his metalmind\nand Pushed against the nails in the floor below them, trying to slow himself\nand Marasi.\nHe didn’t have enough time to do it well. They crashed into the floor of\nthe next story down, and something heavy landed on them, driving the\nbreath from Waxillium’s lungs. There was glaring brightness and a burst of\nheat.\nThen it was over.\nWaxillium lay dazed, ears ringing. He groaned, then realized that Marasi"

He groaned, then realized that Marasi\nwas clinging to him, shaking. He held her close for a moment, blinking.\nWere they still in danger? What had fallen on them?\nWayne, he thought. He forced himself to move, rolling over and setting\nMarasi aside. The floor beneath them had been crushed practically to\nsplinters, the nails flattened to little disks. Part of his downward Push must\nhave been while he still had the increased weight.\nThey were covered with chips of wood and plaster dust. The ceiling was\na wreck, sections of wood smoldering, bits of ash and debris wafting down.\nThere was nothing left of the hole he’d broken; the blast had consumed it\nand the floor around it.\nWincing, he moved Wayne. His friend had fallen on them and blocked\nthe brunt of the explosion from above. His duster had been shredded, his\nback exposed, blackened and burned, blood dribbling down his sides.\nMarasi raised a hand to her mouth. She was still trembling, her dark\nbrown hair tangled, eyes wide.\nNo, Waxillium thought, uncertain if he should try to turn his friend over\nor not. Please, no. Wayne had used a portion of his health to recover from\nthe poison. And last night, he’d said he only had enough left for one bullet\nwound.…\nAnxious, he felt at Wayne’s neck. There was a faint pulse. Waxillium\nclosed his eyes and let out a deep breath. As he watched, the wounds on\nWayne’s back began to draw closed. It was a slow process. A Bloodmaker\nusing Feruchemical healing was limited by how fast he wanted the power to\nwork—recovering quickly required a much greater expenditure of health. If\nWayne didn’t have much left, he’d need to work at a slow pace.\nWaxillium left him to it. Wayne would be suffering great pain, but there\nwas nothing he could do. Instead, he took Marasi’s arm. She was still\ntrembling.\n“It’s all right,” Waxillium said, his voice sounding odd and muffled\nbecause of the explosion’s effect on his hearing. “Wayne is healing. Are you\ninjured?”\n“I…” She looked dazed. “Two in three sufferers of great trauma are\nunable to correctly identify their own injuries as a result of stress or the\nbody’s own natural coping mechanisms covering the pain.”\n“Tell me if any of this hurts,” Waxillium said, feeling at her ankles, then\nlegs, then arms for breaks. He carefully prodded her sides for broken ribs,\nthough it was difficult through the thick cloth of her dress.\nShe slowly came out of her daze, then looked at him and pulled him\nclose, tucking her head against his chest. He hesitated, then wrapped his\narms around her and held her as she steadied her breath, obviously trying to\nget hold of her emotions.\nBehind them, Wayne started coughing. He stirred, then groaned and lay\nstill, letting the healing continue. They’d fallen into a spare bedroom. The\nbuilding was burning, but not too badly. Likely the constables would soon\nbe called."

        "text": "still, letting the healing continue. They’d fallen into a spare bedroom. The\nbuilding was burning, but not too badly. Likely the constables would soon\nbe called.\nNobody has come running, Waxillium thought. The other staff. Are they\nall right?\nOr were they part of it? His mind was still trying to catch up. Tillaume—\na man who, as far as he knew, had served his uncle faithfully for decades—\nhad tried to kill him. Three times.\nMarasi pulled back. “I think I … I think I’ve composed myself. Thank\nyou.”\nHe nodded to her, pulling out his handkerchief and handing it over, then\nknelt by Wayne. The man’s back was crusted with blood and burned skin,\nbut it had been lifted and raised as scabs, new skin forming underneath.\n“Is it bad?” Wayne asked, eyes still closed.\n“You’ll pull through.”\n“I meant the duster.”\n“Oh. Well … you’re gonna need a really big patch this time.”\nWayne snorted, then pushed himself up and moved into a sitting position.\nHe winced several times during the process, then finally opened his eyes.\nTrails of tears were running down the side of his face. “I told you,” Wayne\nsaid. “Innocent things are always exploding around you, Wax.”\n“You kept your fingers this time.”\n“Great. I can still strangle you.”\nWaxillium smiled, resting his hand on his friend’s arm. “Thanks.”\nWayne nodded. “I apologize for havin’ to fall on you two.”\n“I’ll forgive you, under the circumstances.” Waxillium glanced at Marasi.\nShe sat with her arms wrapped around herself, hunched forward, face pale.\nShe saw his scrutiny, then lowered her arms, as if forcing herself to be\nstrong, and began to stand up.\n“It’s all right,” Waxillium said. “You can take more time.”\n“I’ll be well,” she said, though it was hard to make out the words, as his\nhearing was still dulled. “I just … I’m unaccustomed to people trying to kill\nme.”\n“You don’t ever get accustomed to it,” Wayne said. “Trust me.” He took a\ndeep breath, then pulled off the remnants of his duster and shirt. Then he\nturned his burned back to Waxillium. “You mind?”\n“You may want to turn away, Marasi,” Waxillium said.\nShe frowned, but didn’t look away. So he grabbed the burned layer at\nWayne’s shoulder and—with a jerk—ripped the skin off his back. It came\nfree in almost a single complete sheet. Wayne grunted.\nNew skin had formed underneath, pink and fresh, but it couldn’t finish\nhealing properly until the old, stiff, burned layer had been removed.\nWaxillium tossed it aside.\n“Oh, Lord of Harmony,” Marasi said, raising a hand to her mouth. “I\nthink I might be sick.”\n“I warned you,” Waxillium said.\n“I thought you were referring to his burns. I didn’t realize you were going\nto tear off his entire back.”\n“It feels much better now.” Wayne rolled his arms in his shoulders, now\nshirtless.

        "text": "to tear off his entire back.”\n“It feels much better now.” Wayne rolled his arms in his shoulders, now\nshirtless. He was lean and muscled, and he wore a pair of gold metalmind\nbracers on his upper arms. His trousers had been singed, but were mostly\nintact. He reached down, pulling one of his dueling canes out of the\nwreckage. The other was still at his waist. “Now they owe me a hat and a\nduster. Where’s the rest of the house staff?”\n“I’ve been wondering that myself,” Waxillium said. “I’ll do a quick\nsearch and see if anyone’s hurt. You get Marasi out the back. Sneak through\nthe grounds and out the garden gate; I’ll meet you there.”\n“Sneak?” Marasi asked.\n“Whoever hired that bloke to kill us,” Wayne said, “will be expecting that\nexplosion to mean we’ve gone to meet Ironeyes.”\n“Right,” Waxillium said. “We’ll have an hour or two while the house is\nsearched and Tillaume is identified—if there’s enough left to identify.\nDuring that time, we’ll be thought dead.”\n“It’ll give us a little time to think,” Wayne said. “Come on. We should\nmove quick.”\nHe led Marasi down the back stairs toward the grounds. She still seemed\ndazed.\nWaxillium’s ears felt like they were stuffed with cotton. He suspected the\nthree of them had been shouting their conversation. Wayne was right. You\nnever got used to people trying to kill you.\nWaxillium began a quick search of the house, and started refilling his\nmetalminds as he did. He became much lighter, about half his normal\nweight. Any more than that and it became difficult to walk normally, even\nwith clothing and guns weighing him down. He was practiced at it, though.\nDuring his search, he found Limmi and Miss Grimes unconscious, but\nalive, in the pantry. A glance out the window showed the coachman, Krent,\nstanding with his hands on his head and looking at the burning building\nwith eyes wide. Of the other house staff—the maids, the errand boys, the\ncook—there was no sign.\nThey might have been close enough to the blast to be caught in it, but\nWaxillium didn’t think that likely. Probably, Tillaume—who had charge\nover household staff—had sent away everyone that he reasonably could,\nthen had drugged the others and stuffed them someplace safe. It indicated a\ndesire to ensure that nobody was hurt. Well, nobody but Waxillium and his\nguests.\nIn two quick trips, Waxillium carried the unconscious women out into the\nback garden—being careful not to be seen. Hopefully, they would soon be\ndiscovered by Krent or the constables. After that, Waxillium fetched a pair\nof revolvers from the closet on the main floor and got a shirt and jacket\nfrom the laundry for Wayne. He wished he could look for his old trunk,\nwith his Sterrions, but there wasn’t time.\nHe slipped out the back door and crossed the garden on too-light feet.\nEach step of the way, he was increasingly bothered by what had happened.\nIt was horrible for someone to try to kill you; it was worse when the attack\ncame from someone you knew."

How could they have even known that an\naging butler would be amenable? The groom or gardener would have been a\nfar safer choice. Something more was going on here. From Waxillium’s first\nday in the city, Tillaume had been trying to discourage him from getting\ninvolved in local lawkeeping. On the night before the ball, he’d pointedly\ntried to get Waxillium to drop the subject of the robberies.\nWhoever was behind this, the butler had been working with them for\nsome time. And that meant they’d been watching Waxillium all along.\n10\nThe carriage rattled on the paving stones as it rolled in a cautiously\ncircuitous route toward the Fifth Octant. Marasi looked out at the busy\nstreet, her arms folded. Horses and carriages passed, and people flowed\ndown sidewalks like the little blood cells through veins she’d looked at\nunder a microscope at the university. They got clogged at corners or at\nsections where the paving stones were being replaced.\nLord Waxillium and Wayne sat on the other side of the carriage.\nWaxillium looked distracted, lost in his thoughts. Wayne was napping, head\ntipped back, eyes closed. He’d found a hat somewhere—a flimsy cap, of the\ntype broadsheet boys liked to wear. After fleeing the mansion, they’d\nrounded the street corner and cut through Dampmere Park. On the other\nside, Waxillium had waved them down a carriage.\nBy the time they’d piled in, Wayne had been pulling on the cap, whistling\nsoftly to himself. She had no idea where he’d gotten it. Now he was snoring\nsoftly. After they’d nearly been killed, after he’d had the skin on his back\nseared off, he was sleeping. She could still smell the pungency of burned\ncloth, and her ears were ringing.\nThis was what you wanted, she reminded herself. You’re the one who\ninsisted Lord Harms bring you along to meet Waxillium. You came to the\nmansion today of your own accord. You put yourself into this.\nIf only she’d made a better show of herself. She was riding in a carriage\nwith the greatest lawman that the Roughs had ever known—but at every\noccasion, she’d proven herself to be a helpless girl, prone to bursts of\nuseless emotion. She started to sigh, but cut herself off. No. No sulking.\nThat would only make things worse.\nThey were paralleling one of the great spoke-canals that divided the eight\nparts of the city. She’d seen reproductions of pages from the Words of\nFounding, which had included drawings and plans for Elendel, though the\nname of the city had been chosen by the Lord Mistborn. There was a large\nround park at the center where flowers bloomed year-round, the air warmed\nby a hot spring underneath. The canal spokes radiated from it, extending out\ninto the bountiful hinterlands, and the river divided around it. Streets and\nblocks were laid out in an orderly way, with large streets—wider than"

Streets and\nblocks were laid out in an orderly way, with large streets—wider than\nanyone would once have assumed they’d need. Yet now they almost seemed\ninsufficient.\nThe carriage was approaching the bridge to the Field of Rebirth; the\nblanket of green grass and blooming Marewill flowers rose in a gradual\nhillside slope. The statues of the Last Emperor and the Ascendant Warrior\ndominated the top, capping their tomb. There was a museum there. Marasi\nhad been there several times as a girl to look at the relics of the World of\nAsh that had been saved by the Originators, those who had been nurtured in\nwombs of the earth and reborn to build society.\nThe carriage turned along the tree-shaded drive around the Field of\nRebirth. Asphalt paving was used here instead of stones to quiet the clatter\nof steel-shod hooves, and also smoothed the way for the occasional\nmotorcar. Those were still rare, but one of her professors claimed that they\nwould eventually replace horses.\nShe tried to keep her mind on their task. There was more to the Vanishers\nthan just the kidnappings and the robberies. What of the way the trains’\ncargo disappeared so abruptly, giving the Vanishers their name? And what\nof the extremely well-made weapons? And then there was the major effort\nto kill Waxillium, both with poison and that bomb.\n“Lord Waxillium?” she said.\n“Yes?”\n“How did your uncle die?”\n“Carriage accident,” he said, looking thoughtful. “He, his wife, and my\nsister were riding in the Outer Estates. This was mere weeks after my\ncousin—the heir—had succumbed to disease. The trip was supposed to help\nease their grief.\n“Uncle Ladrian wanted to visit a particular peak to get a view of the\nlandscape, but my aunt was too weak for the hike. They took a carriage.\nAlong the way, the horse bolted. The hitchings snapped. The carriage went\noff the cliffside.”\n“I’m sorry.”\n“I am as well,” he said softly. “I hadn’t been to see any of them in years. I\nfeel a strange guilt, as if I should be more crushed to lose them.”\n“I think that story involves enough crushed people already,” Wayne\nmurmured.\nWaxillium gave him a glare, though Wayne didn’t see it, as his eyes were\nstill closed, the cap resting on his face.\nMarasi kicked him in the shin, causing him to yelp. Then she blushed.\n“Be respectful of the dead,” she said.\nWayne rubbed his leg. “Already she starts orderin’ me around. Women.”\nHe put his cap back on his face and settled back.\n“Lord Waxillium,” she said. “Did you ever wonder if…”\n“If someone might have killed my uncle?” Waxillium asked. “I am a\nlawkeeper. I wonder, if just briefly, about every death I hear of. But the\nreports I received indicated nothing suspicious. One of the things I learned\nearly in my career was that sometimes, accidents simply do happen. My\nuncle was a risk taker. His gambling youth led to a middle age where he\nsought thrills. I eventually dismissed the tragedy as an accident.”\n“And now?”"

I eventually dismissed the tragedy as an accident.”\n“And now?”\n“And now,” Waxillium said, “I wonder if the reports sent to me were a\nlittle too clean. In retrospect, everything might have been carefully crafted\nnot to arouse my suspicions. Beyond that, Tillaume was there, though he\nremained behind at the manor house the day of the accident.”\n“Why would they kill your uncle?” Marasi asked. “Shouldn’t they have\nbeen worried about bringing you, an experienced lawkeeper, back to town?\nRemoving your uncle and accidentally putting Waxillium Dawnshot onto\nthem…”\n“Waxillium Dawnshot?” Wayne asked, cracking an eye. He sniffled\nsoftly and wiped his nose with his handkerchief.\nShe blushed. “Sorry. But it’s what the reports call him.”\n“That’s what they should call me,” Wayne said. “I’m the one who likes a\ngood shot of whiskey in the morning.”\n“‘Morning’ to you is well past noon, Wayne,” Waxillium said. “I doubt\nyou’ve ever seen the dawn.”\n“That’s right unfair. See it all the time, when I stay up too late.…” He\ngrinned underneath his hat. “Wax, when are we going to go see Ranette?”\n“We’re not,” Waxillium said. “What makes you think we will?”\n“Well, we’re in town. She’s in town too—moved here before you did,\nand all. Our house exploded. We could go see her, you know. Be all\nfriendly, like.”\n“No,” Waxillium said. “I wouldn’t even know where to find her. The City\nis a big place.”\n“She lives over in the Third Octant,” Wayne said absently. “Redbrick\nhouse. Two stories.”\nWaxillium gave Wayne a flat stare, which Marasi found curious. “Who is\nthis person?”\n“Nobody,” Waxillium said. “How are you with a pistol?”\n“Not good,” she admitted. “The target club uses rifles.”\n“Well, a rifle doesn’t fit in a handbag,” Waxillium said, taking a pistol out\nof his shoulder holster. It was small, with a slim barrel. The entire weapon\nwas only about as long as her hand.\nShe took the gun hesitantly.\n“The trick to shooting with a pistol is to be steady,” Waxillium said. “Use\nboth hands, find low cover if you can and set your arms on it. Don’t shake,\ntake your time, and be sure to sight. Pistols are much harder to hit with, but\nthat’s partially because people tend to be wilder with them. The very nature\nof a rifle encourages you to take aim, while people’s first impulse with a\npistol seems to be to just point vaguely and pull the trigger.”\n“Yes,” she said, hefting the gun. It was deceptively heavy. “Eight of ten\nof constables firing a handgun at a criminal ten feet away miss.”\n“Really?”\nShe nodded.\n“Well,” Waxillium said, “I guess Wayne doesn’t need to feel so bad.”\n“Hey!”\nWaxillium eyed her. “I once saw him try to shoot someone three paces\naway. He ended up hitting the wall behind himself.”"

        "text": "“Hey!”\nWaxillium eyed her. “I once saw him try to shoot someone three paces\naway. He ended up hitting the wall behind himself.”\n“’S not my fault,” Wayne grumbled. “Bullets are devious buggers. They\nshouldn’t be allowed to bounce. Metal don’t bounce, and that’s true as\ntitanium.”\nShe checked the small revolver to make sure the safety was on, then\ntucked it into her singed handbag.\nThe Vanishers’ hideout turned out to be an innocent-looking building\nnear a canal dock. Two stories tall, it was flat-topped and wide, with\nnumerous chimneys. Piles of dark ashes and slag were heaped along one\nwall of the building, and the windows looked like they hadn’t been cleaned\nsince the Final Ascension.\n“Lady Marasi,” Waxillium asked, checking the sights on his revolver,\n“would you be terribly offended if I suggested you wait in the carriage\nwhile we reconnoiter? The place is likely abandoned, but I wouldn’t be\nsurprised to find a few traps left behind.”\n“No,” she said, shivering. “I wouldn’t mind. I think that would be just\nfine.”\n“I’ll wave when we’re certain the place is clear,” he said, then raised his\nhandgun and nodded to Wayne. They ducked out of the carriage, running in\na low squat to the side of the building. They didn’t go to the door. Instead,\nWayne jumped—and Waxillium must have Pushed him, for the wiry man\nleaped a good twelve feet and landed on the roof. Waxillium followed,\njumping more gracefully, landing without a sound. They moved over to the\nfar corner, where Wayne swung down and kicked in a window. Waxillium\nswung in after him.\nShe waited a few tense minutes. The coachman didn’t say a word about\nany of it, though she heard him muttering “none of my business” to himself.\nWaxillium had paid him enough that he’d better stay quiet.\nNo gunshots sounded. Eventually, Waxillium opened the door to the\nbuilding and waved. She hurriedly climbed from the carriage and\napproached.\n“Well?” she asked.\n“Two tripwires,” Waxillium said, “rigged with explosives. Nothing else\ndangerous we could find. Other than Wayne’s body odor.”\n“That’s the smell of incredibleness,” Wayne called from inside.\n“Come on,” Waxillium said, holding the door open for her.\nShe stepped in, then hesitated in the doorway. “It’s empty.”\nShe’d expected forges and equipment. Instead, the cavernous room was\nvacant, like a classroom during winter holiday. Light shone in through\nwindows, though it was very dim. The chamber smelled of coal and fire,\nand there were blackened areas on the floor.\n“Sleeping quarters up there,” Waxillium said, pointing at the other side of\nthe foundry. “The main chamber here is double height for half the building,\nbut the other side has a second story. Looked like they could house some\nfifty men in there, men who could act like foundry workers during the days\nto maintain the front.”\n“Aha!” Wayne said from the darkness on the left side of the chamber.

        "text": "fifty men in there, men who could act like foundry workers during the days\nto maintain the front.”\n“Aha!” Wayne said from the darkness on the left side of the chamber. She\nheard a rattling, then light flooded the room as he pushed back the wall. It\nopened there, rolling to give large-scale access to the canal.\n“How easily did that open?” Waxillium asked, trotting over. Marasi\nfollowed.\n“I dunno,” Wayne said, shrugging. “Easy enough.”\nWaxillium inspected the door. It slid on wheels in a small channel cut\ninto the floor. He rubbed his fingers in the trench and brought them out,\nrubbing grease between them.\n“They’ve been using it,” Marasi said.\n“Exactly,” Waxillium said.\n“So?” Wayne asked.\n“If they were doing illegal things in here,” Marasi said, “they wouldn’t be\nwanting to open the entire side of the building with any frequency.”\n“Maybe they did it to keep up the act,” Waxillium said, rising.\nMarasi nodded, thoughtful. “Oh! Aluminum.”\nWayne pulled out his dueling canes, spinning. “What? Where? Who’s\nshooting?”\nMarasi felt herself blush. “Sorry. I meant, we should check and see if we\ncan find any aluminum droplets on the ground. You know, from forging or\ncasting guns. That will tell us if this place is really the hideout, or if\nWayne’s source was trying to lead us to a bad alloy.”\n“He was honest,” Wayne said. “I got a sense for that sort of thing.” He\nsneezed.\n“You believed that Lessie really was a dancer, the first time we met her,”\nWaxillium said, rising.\n“That’s different. She was a woman. Good at lying, they are. The God\nBeyond made’m that way.”\n“I’m … not certain how I should take that,” Marasi said.\n“With a pinch of copper,” Waxillium said. “And a healthy dose of\nskepticism. Just like anything Wayne says.” He held out his hand.\nMarasi frowned, raising her palm. He dropped something into it. Some\nbits of metal that looked like they’d been scraped off the floor, where they’d\ncooled. They were silvery, light, and dirty black around the edges.\n“I found them on the floor over there,” Waxillium said. “Near one of the\nblackened sections.”\n“Aluminum?” she asked eagerly.\n“Yes,” he said. “At least, I can’t Push them with Allomancy, which along\nwith their appearance is sufficient indication.” He studied her. “You’ve got a\ngood mind for this sort of thing.”\nShe blushed. Again. Rust and Ruin! she thought. I’m going to have to find\na way to deal with that. “It’s about deviations, Lord Waxillium.”\n“Deviations?”\n“Numbers, patterns, movements. People seem erratic, but they actually\nfollow patterns. Find the deviations, isolate the reason why they deviated,\nand you’ll often learn something. Aluminum on the floor. It’s a deviation.”\n“And are there others, here?”\n“The opening door,” she said, nodding to the side. “Those windows.\nThey’re smeared with too much soot. If I were to guess, it was put there by"

        "text": "“And are there others, here?”\n“The opening door,” she said, nodding to the side. “Those windows.\nThey’re smeared with too much soot. If I were to guess, it was put there by\nburning a candle close to the glass to blacken it so nobody could peek in.”\n“Maybe it was natural,” Waxillium said. “From forging.”\n“Why would the windows be closed during the heat of forging? Those\nwindows can open easily, and they open outward—so there wouldn’t be any\nsoot on them. Not so much, at least. Either they left them closed while\nworking in order to hide what was in here, or they darkened them\nintentionally.”\n“Clever,” Waxillium said.\n“So the question is,” she said, “what have they been moving in and out of\nthe building through that large side door? Something important enough that\nthey’d open it, even after going through so much trouble with the\nwindows.”\n“That part, at least, is easy,” Waxillium said. “They’ve been robbing\nfreight cars, so they’ve been moving the cargo in.”\n“Which implies they’ve been shipping it after stealing it…” Marasi said.\n“Which gives us a lead,” Waxillium said with a nod. “They’ve been\nmoving things in and out of this location via the canals. In fact, the canals\nmight be connected to how they’re getting the cargo out of the railway cars\nso easily.” He strode away toward the door.\n“Where are you going?” she asked.\n“I’m going to go sniff around outside,” he said. “You two go look\nthrough the sleeping quarters. Tell me if you see any … deviations, as you\nput it.” He hesitated. “Let Wayne go in first. We might have missed a trap or\ntwo. Better for him to explode than you.”\n“Hey!” Wayne said.\n“I mean it with all fondness,” Waxillium said, slipping out through the\nopen side of the building. Then he leaned back in. “And maybe it will blow\nyour face off, and spare us having to look at that mug of yours.” With that,\nhe left.\nWayne smiled. “Damn. Sure is good to see him acting more like himself\nagain.”\n“So he wasn’t always so solemn?”\n“Oh, Wax has always been solemn,” Wayne said, wiping his nose with\nhis handkerchief. “But when he’s at his best, there’s a smirk underneath.\nC’mon.”\nHe led her to the back part of the building. There was a small box by the\nwall, the explosives they had discovered and disarmed, she assumed. The\nceiling was lower here. Wayne climbed up a stairwell, gesturing for her to\nwait.\nShe poked around, looking for anything that had been discarded, but\nsucceeded only in making herself jump a few times when she thought she\nsaw something from the corner of her eye. This side of the chamber was\nvery dim.\nWas Wayne taking too long? She fidgeted, then finally decided to climb\nthe stairwell.\nIt was dark inside. Not pitch dark, just dark enough that she thought she\nshould be able to see what she was doing—but couldn’t. She hesitated\nhalfway up the stairs, then decided she was a fool and pushed forward."

She hesitated\nhalfway up the stairs, then decided she was a fool and pushed forward.\n“Wayne?” she said, nervous as she peeked out of the stairwell. The upper\nfloor was lit by a few windows, darkened by soot, despite being in an area\nwhere there would be no forging or casting. That reinforced her theory. And\nher nervousness.\n“He is dead, young lady,” an aged, distinguished voice said from the\ndarkness. “I am sorry for your loss.”\nHer heart just about stopped.\n“Yes,” the voice continued, “he was simply too handsome, too clever,\nand too immensely remarkable in all aspects of his existence to allow to\nlive.” Someone pushed open a window, letting in light and revealing\nWayne’s face. “I’m afraid it took a hundred men to bring him down, and he\nkilled all but one. His last words were, ‘Tell Wax … that he’s a total git …\nand he still owes me five notes.’”\n“Wayne,” she hissed.\n“Couldn’t help myself, mate,” he said, switching back to his own voice,\nwhich was completely different. “Sorry. But you shouldn’t have come up\nhere.” He nodded to the corner, where a few sticks of something lay against\nthe wall.\n“More explosives?” she said, feeling faint.\n“Yeah. We missed them on the first pass. Were rigged to blow when the\nlatch was opened on a chest in the corner.”\n“Was there anything in the chest?”\n“Yeah. Explosives. Weren’t you listening?”\nShe gave him a flat stare.\n“No,” he said, chuckling. “I don’t know what Wax expects us to find in\nthis place. Swept it clean, they did.”\nBy the light of the open window, she could make out a low-ceilinged\nroom. Well, more of a loft. She and Wayne could walk in it without bending\nover, but him just barely. Waxillium would have to stoop.\nThe floorboards were warped and there were nails sticking out in places.\nShe had images of prying one up and finding some stash of hidden clues,\nbut as she felt across the floor, she realized she could see between the\nboards to the floor below. There wasn’t really any space for hiding things.\nWayne poked through some cupboards built into the wall, checking for\nexplosives, then knocking for hidden compartments. Marasi looked around,\nbut quickly determined that there wasn’t anything to find here. Other than,\nperhaps, the explosives.\nExplosives.\n“Wayne, what kind of explosives are those?”\n“Hum? Oh, ordinary stuff. They call it dynamite, used for blowing holes\nin rock out in the Roughs. Pretty easy to get, even in the city. These are\nsmaller sticks than I’ve seen, but basically the same stuff.”\n“Oh.” She frowned. “Were they in anything?”\nHe hesitated, then looked back at the trunk. “Huh.” He reached in and\nheld up something. “They weren’t in anything, but someone used this to\nprop up the fuse and the detonator.”\n“What is it?” she asked, hurrying over.\n“Cigar box,” he said, letting her see it. “Citizen Magistrates. Expensive\nbrand. Very expensive.”"

Very expensive.”\nShe looked over the box. The top was painted gold and red, with the\nbrand splayed across in large letters. There weren’t any cigars left, though it\ndid look like some numbers had been scribbled across the inside of the lid\nin pencil. The sequence didn’t make any sense to her.\n“We’ll show it to Wax,” Wayne said. “This is just the sort of thing he\nlikes. It’ll probably lead him to some grand theory about how our boss\nsmokes cigars, and that’ll somehow let him pick the guy out of a crowd.\nHe’s always doing stuff like that, ever since we started working together.”\nWayne smiled, taking the cigar box back, then returned to poking around\nthe cupboards.\n“Wayne,” Marasi said. “How did you end up with Waxillium, anyway?”\n“That wasn’t in your reports?” he asked, knocking at the side of a\ncupboard.\n“No. It’s considered a bit of a mystery.”\n“We don’t talk about it much,” Wayne said, voice muffled, head inside\nthe cupboard. “He saved my life.”\nShe smiled, sitting down on the floor, resting her back against the wall.\n“That’s probably a good story.”\n“It’s not what you’re thinking,” he said, pulling his head out. “I was to be\nhanged over in Far Dorest, by the lawkeeper there.”\n“Wrongfully, I assume?”\n“Depends on your definition of that particular word and all,” Wayne said.\n“I shot a man. Innocent one.”\n“Was it an accident?”\n“Yeah,” Wayne said. “I only meant to rob him.” He paused, looking at\nthe cupboard, seeming distant. He shook his head, then crawled inside,\npushing hard and breaking in the back wall.\nThat wasn’t what she’d expected to hear. She sat back, hands around her\nlegs. “You were a criminal?”\n“Not a very capable one,” Wayne said from inside the cupboard. “I’ve\nalways had a problem not taking things. I just grab stuff, you know? And\nthen it’s there, in my fingers. Anyway, I was getting good at it, and I had\nsome friends … they convinced me that I should go a little farther. Really\ntake hold of my destiny, they said. Start going for coin, get into robbing\nwith guns and the like. So I tried it out. Left a man dead. Father of three.”\nHe pulled out of the broken cupboard, then held something up. It looked\nlike cards of some sort.\n“Clues?” she asked eagerly.\n“Nudes,” he said, flipping through them. “Old ones. Probably from\nbefore our bandits bought this place.” He flipped through a few more, then\ntossed them back into the hole. “At least it will give the conners something\nfun to find.” He looked back at her, seeming … haunted, his eyes lying in\nshadow, face lit on one side by the open window.\n“So what happened?” she asked softly. “With you, I mean. Unless you\ndon’t want to tell.”\nHe shrugged. “I didn’t really know what I was doing, and I panicked. I"

I\nthink maybe I wanted to be caught. Never wanted to shoot that bloke. Just\nwanted his purse, you know? Old Deadfinger caught me easy. He didn’t\neven have to beat a confession out of me.” Wayne was quiet for a moment.\n“I cried the whole time. I was sixteen. Just a kid.”\n“Did you know you were an Allomancer?” she asked.\n“Sure. That was kinda why I was in the Roughs in the first place, but\nthat’s another story. Anyway, bendalloy is hard to make. Bismuth and\ncadmium aren’t the kinds of metals you find in your corner store. Didn’t\nknow much about Feruchemy yet, though my father was a Feruchemist, so I\nhad an idea. But storing health, it takes gold.”\nHe walked over, sitting down on the floor beside her. “Still don’t know\nwhy Wax saved me. I shoulda hanged, you know. Killed a good man. He\nwasn’t even rich. He was a bookkeeper. Did charity work for anyone who\nneeded it—wills drawn up, letters read. Every week, he transcribed letters\nfor the mine workers who couldn’t write, so they could send them home to\ntheir families in the city. Found out a lot about him in the trial, you see. Got\nto see his kids crying. And his wife…”\nWayne reached into his pocket, then unfolded something. A sheet of\npaper. “Got a letter from them a few months back.”\n“They write you letters?” Marasi said.\n“Sure. I send them half of what I make. Keeps the kids fed, you know.\nFigure it makes sense, seein’ as to how I killed their daddy. One went to\nuniversity.” He hesitated. “They still hate me. Write me the letters to let me\nknow they haven’t forgiven me, that no money will bring back their daddy.\nThey’re right. But they do take the money, so that’s something.”\n“Wayne…” Marasi said. “I’m so sorry.”\n“Yeah. Me too. Some mistakes, though, you can’t fix by being sorry.\nCan’t fix them, no matter what you do. Guns and me, we haven’t gotten\nalong ever since. My hand starts shaking when I hold one, wobbling about\nlike a damn fish dumped on the docks. Ain’t that the funniest thing? Like\nmy hand thinks by itself.”\nThe sound of footsteps came from the stairwell and a few moments later\nWaxillium walked in. He raised an eyebrow at the two of them sitting there\non the floor.\n“See now,” Wayne said. “We’re having a heart-to-heart, here. Don’t go\nstomping in and making a mess of things.”\n“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Waxillium said. “I spoke with the local beggars.\nThe Vanishers have been moving something large in and out of the building\nand onto a canal boat. They did it on several occasions, always at night. It\nseems to have been bigger than just cargo; some kind of machinery, I\nsuspect.”\n“Huh,” Wayne said."

It\nseems to have been bigger than just cargo; some kind of machinery, I\nsuspect.”\n“Huh,” Wayne said.\n“Huh indeed,” Waxillium said. “You?”\n“Found a box,” Wayne said, holding out the cigar box. “Oh, and some\nmore dynamite. In case you want to blast out a new canal or something.”\n“Bring it,” Waxillium said. “Might be useful.” He took the cigar box.\n“There’s some nudie pictures too,” Wayne noted, pointing at the\ncupboard. “They’re so faded you can barely make out the good parts,\nthough.” He hesitated. “The ladies ain’t wearing any guns, so you probably\nwouldn’t be interested anyway.”\nWaxillium snorted.\n“The cigar box is of an expensive variety,” Marasi said, standing up.\n“Unlikely to be from one of the common thieves, unless they took it from\nsomeone. But look. Someone wrote some numbers on the inside.”\n“Indeed,” Waxillium said. He narrowed his eyes, then looked at Wayne,\nwho nodded.\n“What?” she said. “You know something?”\nWaxillium tossed the box back to Wayne, who tucked it away inside the\npocket of his coat. It was large enough that it hung out. “Have you ever\nheard the name Miles Dagouter?”\n“Sure,” she said. “Miles Hundredlives. He’s a lawkeeper, out in the\nRoughs.”\n“Yes,” Waxillium said somberly. “Come on. I think it’s time for us to take\na trip. While we go, I’ll tell you a few stories.”\n11\nMiles stood by the railing and lit his cigar. He puffed on it a few times to\nget it going, then slowly released a stream of pungent smoke from between\nhis lips.\n“They’ve been spotted, boss,” Tarson said as he walked up. Tarson’s arm\nwas in a sling; most men would still be in bed after taking a shot like he\nhad. But Tarson was a Pewterarm and koloss-blooded. He’d heal quickly.\n“Where?” Miles asked, looking down and surveying the setup of the new\nhideout. Besides Tarson, the only one up here with him was Clamps, third-\nin-command.\n“They’re at the old foundry,” Tarson said. He was still wearing Wayne’s\nhat. “Were talking to the beggars there.”\n“Should have dumped the lot of them in the canal,” Clamps grumbled,\nscratching at the scar on his neck.\n“I’m not going to start killing beggars, Clamps,” Miles said softly. He\nwore a pair of aluminum revolvers; they gleamed in the electric lights of the\nlarge chamber. “You’d be surprised at how quickly something like that can\nbackfire; turn the city’s underclass against us, and all kinds of inconvenient\ninformation will find its way to the constables.”\n“Yeah, sure,” Clamps said. “Of course. But, I mean, those beggars …\nthey saw things, boss.”\n“Wax would have figured it out regardless,” Miles said. “He is like a rat.\nWherever you least wish him to be, there you will find him.

In a way, that\nmakes him predictable. I assume your explosive traps—foolproof though\nyou promised they would be—were ineffective?”\nClamps coughed into his hand.\n“Pity,” Miles said. He took his silver lighter, still in his hand from\nlighting the cigar, and put it back in his pocket. It bore the seal of the\nlawkeepers of True Madil. It made the other men uncomfortable to see that.\nMiles kept it anyway.\nThe space before them was completely windowless. Big, glaring electric\nlights hung from the ceiling, and men were setting up forging and casting\nequipment. Miles was skeptical. A foundry below the ground? But Mister\nSuit promised that his ducts and electric fans would pull the smoke away\nand circulate the air. It helped that there was a lot less smoke with the\nelectric furnaces they’d be using down here.\nThis room was very curious. A large tunnel led off into darkness on the\nleft side of the chamber, and railway tracks were set into it. The beginnings,\nMister Suit said, of an underground railway line in the city. How would it\ncut through the canals? It would have to run under them, he guessed. A\nstrange image.\nAs of now, that tunnel was only a test. It led a short distance to a large\nwooden building, where Miles could quarter the rest of his men. He had\nanother thirty or so. At the moment, they were bringing in boxes of supplies\nand what was left of their aluminum. There wasn’t much. In one blow, Wax\nhad all but upended the Vanishers.\nMiles puffed on his cigar, thoughtful. As always, he was drawing upon\nhis goldmind, invigorating himself, refreshing his body. He never felt sick,\nnever lacked energy. He still had to sleep, and he still grew old, but other\nthan that, he was practically immortal. So long as he had enough gold.\nThat was the problem though, wasn’t it? Smoke curled in front of him,\ntwisting upon itself like the mists.\n“Boss?” Clamps asked. “Mister Suit is waiting. Aren’t you going to go\nmeet with him?”\nMiles blew out smoke. “In a moment.” Suit did not own him. “How is\nrecruitment, Clamps?”\n“It’s … I’ll need more time. One day ain’t enough, ’specially following\nhalf of us getting slaughtered.”\n“Watch your tone,” Miles said.\n“Sorry.”\n“Wax was bound to enter the game eventually,” Miles said softly. “He\nchanges the rules, and it is true that we lost far more men than I would have\nliked. We are fortunate at the same time, however. Now that Waxillium has\nentered, we can anticipate him.”\n“Boss,” Tarson said, leaning in, “there’s talk among the men. That you\nand Wax … that you two set us all up.” He cringed back, as if expecting a\nviolent reaction.\nMiles puffed on his cigar, and managed to contain his initial burst of\nanger. He was getting better at that. A little. “Why would they say that?”\n“You were once a lawkeeper, and all…”"

Oh, the rich will make their own codes, will force us to live by\nthem. But our law is the law of humanity itself.\n“Men who work for me, they are given the dispensation of reform. Their\nwork here washes away their previous … infractions. Tell them I am proud\nof them, Clamps. I realize we’ve been through something traumatic, but we\ndid survive. We will face tomorrow with greater strength.”\n“I’ll tell ’em, boss,” Clamps said.\nMiles covered a grimace. He couldn’t decide if the words were the right\nones or not; he wasn’t meant for preaching. But the men needed conviction\nfrom him, so conviction he would display. “Fifteen years,” he said softly.\n“Boss?”\n“Fifteen years I spent out in the Roughs, trying to protect the weak. And\nyou know what? It never got better. All that effort, it meant nothing.\nChildren still died, women were still abused. One man wasn’t enough to\nchange things, not with the corruption here at the heart of civilization.” He\ntook a puff on his cigar. “If we’re going to change things, we need to\nchange them here, first.”\nAnd Trell help me if I’m wrong. Why had Trell made men like him, if not\nto see wrongs righted? The Words of Founding had even included a lengthy\nexplanation of Trellism and its teachings, which proved men like Miles\nwere special.\nHe turned and moved along the walkway. It hung like a balcony on the\nnorth side of the large chamber. Tarson and Clamps stayed behind; they\nknew he liked to be alone when he faced Mister Suit.\nMiles pulled open the door at the end of the walk, and entered Mister\nSuit’s office. Why he needed an office here, Miles didn’t know; perhaps\nhe’d be keeping a closer eye on operations at this new base. Mister Suit had\nwanted them here from the beginning. It annoyed Miles that he’d finally\nhad to accept the offer—it put him more closely under his backer’s thumb.\nEnough good robberies, and we won’t need him any longer, Miles told\nhimself. Then we can move somewhere else.\nMister Suit was a round-faced man with a full gray-streaked beard. He\nsat at his desk sipping a cup of tea and wearing an extremely stylish and\nexpensive suit of black silk with a turquoise vest. As Miles entered, he was\nstudying a broadsheet.\n“You know I don’t like the smell of those,” Mister Suit said without\nlooking up.\nMiles puffed his cigar anyway.\nMister Suit smiled. “Did I hear that your old friend has already located\nyour previous base of operations?”\n“Men were captured,” Miles said simply. “It was only a matter of time.”\n“They aren’t very loyal to your cause.”\nMiles had no response to that. They both knew that most of his men\nworked for the money, and not for any greater purpose.\n“Do you know why I like you, Miles?” Mister Suit asked."

In fact, your cause is not so\ndifferent from that of my associates and me. I think it is a worthy goal, and\nyou a worthy leader.” Mister Suit turned over his broadsheet. “The\nshootings at the last robbery threaten to undermine my confidence in that\nassessment.”\n“I…”\n“You lost your temper,” Mister Suit said, voice growing cold, “and you\ntherefore lost control of your men. That is why this disaster occurred. There\nwas no other reason.”\n“Yes there was. Waxillium Ladrian.”\n“You should have been ready for him.”\n“He wasn’t supposed to be there.”\nMister Suit sipped his tea. “Come now, Miles. You wore a mask on your\nface. You knew there was a chance he’d come.”\n“I wore a mask,” Miles said, keeping his temper with some effort,\n“because I am a man of some renown. Wax wasn’t the only one who could\nhave recognized me.”\n“A valid point, I suppose. But then, with how dramatic you insist on\nbeing—cargo that vanishes, rather than just being stolen, it makes me\nwonder why you avoid being recognized.”\n“The drama serves a purpose,” Miles snapped. “I’ve told you. So long as\nthe police are baffled by how we’re getting the cargo, it will keep them\nmaking mistakes.”\n“And the drama?” Suit said idly, turning over a newspaper on his desk.\n“The ‘Vanishers,’ Miles?”\nHe said nothing. He’d explained his reasons before, the ones he let Suit\nknow of. There was more to it, of course. He needed to be dramatic, needed\nto capture the public’s attention. Miles was out to change the world. You\ncouldn’t do that if people thought of you as common thieves. Mystery,\npower, a pinch of magic … that could work wonders for his cause.\n“No comment,” Suit said. “Well, your reasoning has proven valid in the\npast. Except when it comes to Waxillium. I’ll admit, Miles, that part of me\nwonders. Is there some ancient grudge between the two of you I should be\naware of? Something that, perhaps, would have caused you to act\nrecklessly?” Mister Suit’s eyes were as cold as iron. “Something that would\nhave made you try to goad him into attacking during that party? So you\ncould fight him?”\nMiles held that gaze, then leaned down, hands on the table, fingers\ngripping his cigar. “I have no grudge against Waxillium Ladrian. He is one\nof the finest men this world has known. A finer man than you or I, or\npractically anyone else in this city.”\n“And this is supposed to comfort me? You all but say that you won’t fight\nhim.”\n“Oh, I’ll fight him. Kill him, if I have to. Wax chose the wrong side. Men\nlike him, men like me, we have a choice. Serve the people or serve the"

He abandoned his right to protection the moment he returned to\nthis city and started mingling with them.”\n“Curious,” Suit said. “I’m also one of them, you know.”\n“I work with what I have. And besides, you have … other things\nrecommending you. Especially since you did renounce your claim to\nprivilege.”\n“Not to privilege,” Suit said. “Merely to title. And I still think you\nintended to provoke Waxillium. That’s why you shot Peterus.”\n“I shot Peterus because he was an impostor,” Miles snapped. “He\npretended to seek justice, and everyone praised him for it, but all the while\nhe was pandering to the elite and the corrupt. In the end, they let him come\nplay at their parties, like a favored dog. I put him down.”\nMister Suit nodded slowly. “Very well.”\n“I will clean this city up, Suit. Even if I have to rip out its blackened heart\nwith my fingernails, I’ll do it. But you’re going to need to get me more\naluminum.”\n“I am setting things in motion,” Suit said. He opened a drawer in his desk\nand took out a rolled sheet of paper. He set it in front of Miles.\nMiles took off the string and unrolled the paper. Schematics. “Tekiel’s\nnew ‘unrobbable’ freight car?”\nSuit nodded.\n“It will take time to—” Miles began.\n“I’ve had people working on this for some time now. Your job is not the\nplanning, Miles. Your job is the execution. I will see that you have the\nresources you need.”\nMiles looked over the blueprint. Suit was connected. Powerful. Miles\ncouldn’t help feeling that he’d gotten himself entangled in something far\nbeyond his control. “My men are still holding the latest captive,” he said.\n“What do you want done with her?”\n“That will be arranged,” Suit said. He took a sip of his tea. “If I had been\npaying closer attention, I would have removed that one from the list.\nWaxillium will not stop seeking her. It would have been so much easier if\nthe explosion had worked. Now we must contemplate more direct action.”\n“I’ll deal with him personally,” Miles said. “Today.”\n* * *\n“Miles Dagouter is Twinborn,” Waxillium said, leaning forward in their\ntrain car. “A particularly dangerous variety of Twinborn.”\n“Double gold,” Wayne said with a nod, reclining on the cushioned bench\nopposite Waxillium. Outside, the outer suburbs of Elendel passed in a blur.\nMarasi sat on the bench near Wayne. “Gold Allomancers aren’t\nparticularly dangerous, from what I’ve read.”\n“No,” Waxillium said. “They aren’t. But it’s the Compounding that\nmakes Miles so powerful. If your Allomancy and Feruchemy share a metal,\nyou can access its power tenfold. It’s complicated. You store an attribute\ninside the metal, then burn it to release the power. It’s called Compounding."

It’s called Compounding.\nBy the legends, it’s the way the Sliver gained immortality.”\nMarasi frowned. “I’d assumed stories of Miles’s extraordinary healing\nabilities to be exaggerations. I assumed he was just a Bloodmaker, like\nWayne.”\n“Oh, he’s a Bloodmaker all right,” Wayne said, spinning a dueling cane\naround his wrist and catching it again. “Except he doesn’t ever run out of\nhealth.”\nWaxillium nodded, thinking back to years ago, when he’d first met Miles.\nThe man had always made him uncomfortable, but he’d also been an\nexcellent lawkeeper. For the most part.\nNoting Marasi’s confused look, Waxillium explained, “Normally a\nFeruchemist has to be sparing. It can take months to store up health or\nweight. I’ve been walking around at half weight since breaking us through\nthe floor, trying to recover some of what I expended. I’ve barely filled my\nmetalmind to a fraction of what I lost. It’s even harder for Wayne.”\nWayne wiped his nose. “I’ll have to spend a few weeks in bed after this,\nfeeling wretched. Otherwise, I’ll be unable to heal myself. Hell, I’m already\nstoring as much as I can and still move about normally. By the end of the\nday, I’ll barely have enough to heal a scratch.”\n“But Miles…” Marasi said.\n“Near-infinite healing ability,” Waxillium said. “The man’s virtually\nimmortal. I heard he once took a shotgun blast to the face point-blank and\nwalked away from it. We worked together out in the Roughs. He was the\nlawkeeper over in True Madil. There were three of us that had a kind of\nalliance going, during the good years. Miles, me, and Jon Deadfinger from\nFar Dorest.”\n“Miles doesn’t like me much,” Wayne noted. “Well … neither of them\ndo, actually.”\n“Miles did good work,” Waxillium said. “But he was judgmental and\nharsh. We respected one another, though mostly from a distance. I wouldn’t\ncall us friends. But out in the Roughs, anyone who stands up for what is\nright is an ally.”\n“It’s the first law of the Roughs,” Wayne said. “The more alone you are,\nthe more you need a man you can trust at your side.”\n“Even if their methods go beyond what you’d choose yourself,”\nWaxillium said.\n“He doesn’t sound like the type to take up a life of crime,” Marasi said.\n“No,” Waxillium said softly. “He doesn’t. But I was almost certain it was\nhim behind the mask at the wedding, and that box of cigars, they’re his\nfavorites. I can’t be sure it’s him, but…”\n“But you think it is.”\nWaxillium nodded. Harmony helps us, but I do. Lawkeepers were a\nspecial alloy. There was a code. Never give in, never let yourself be\ntempted. Working with criminals day in, day out could change a man. You\nbegan to see things the way they did. You started to think like them."

You started to think like them.\nThey all knew this job could twist you if you weren’t careful. They didn’t\nspeak of it, and they didn’t give in. Or they weren’t supposed to.\n“I’m not surprised,” Wayne said. “Did you ever hear how he spoke of\npeople in Elendel, Wax? He’s a brutal man, Miles is.”\n“Yes,” Waxillium said softly. “I hoped he’d stay focused on keeping\norder in his town and let his demons slumber.”\nThe train passed beyond the suburbs, heading into the Outer Estates—the\nbroad ring of orchards, fields, and pastures that fed Elendel. The landscape\nchanged from city blocks to open expanses of tan and green, the canals\nshimmering blue as they cut the land.\n“Does this change things?” Marasi asked.\n“Yes,” Waxillium said. “It means all this is far more dangerous than I’d\nthought.”\n“Delightful.”\nWayne grinned. “Well, we wanted you to have the full experience. You\nknow, for science and all.”\n“Actually,” Waxillium said, “I’ve been thinking of how best to send you\nsomeplace safe.”\n“You want to be rid of me?” she asked. She widened her eyes to look\nheartbroken, her voice softening in a pitiful kind of betrayed way. He was\nhalf tempted to think she’d been learning from Wayne. “I thought I was\nbeing of help to you.”\n“You are,” Waxillium said. “But you also have little practical experience\nin what we are doing.”\n“A woman must gain experience somehow,” she said, lifting her head.\n“I’ve already survived a kidnapping and an assassination attempt.”\nThe doors of the passenger car rattled as they rounded a bend. “Yes, but\nLady Marasi, the presence of a Twinborn on the other side changes things.\nIf it comes to a fight, I don’t think I can defeat Miles. He’s crafty, powerful,\nand determined. I’d rather you were somewhere safe.”\n“Where?” she asked. “Any of your estates would be obvious, as would\nthose of my father. I can’t very well hide in the underground of the city; I\nhighly doubt I’d be inconspicuous there! I hasten to suggest that the safest\nplace for me is near you.”\n“Odd,” Wayne said, “I usually find the safest places in life are\neverywhere but near Wax. Have I mentioned the likelihood of explosions?”\n“Perhaps we should just go to the constables,” Marasi said. “Lord\nWaxillium … this kind of private investigation is technically illegal—at\nleast insofar as we have important facts that the constables don’t. We are\nrequired to bring what we know to the authorities.”\n“Don’t get him thinking!” Wayne said. “I was just starting to get him to\nstop saying stuff like that!”\n“It’s all right, Wayne,” Waxillium said softly. “I’ve made a promise. I\ntold Lord Harms I’d return Steris to him. And I will. That is that.”\n“Then I will remain and help,” Marasi said. “That is that.”\n“And I could really use some food,” Wayne added. “Fat is fat.”"

You know little\nabout Feruchemy, but seem to understand Allomancy. You weren’t surprised\nwhen Wayne stopped time in a bubble around us—in fact, you stepped right\nup to the barrier, as if familiar with them. And you come from a hereditary\nline that is being hunted precisely because it includes a lot of Allomancers.”\n“I…” she said. “Well, there really wasn’t a good opportunity…” She\nblushed more furiously.\n“I’m surprised, and a little disappointed,” Wayne said.\n“Well,” she said quickly, “I—”\n“Oh, not at you,” Wayne said. “At Wax. I’d have expected that he’d put\nthis sort of thing together on your first meeting.”\n“I’m growing slow in my old age,” Waxillium said dryly.\n“It’s not really very useful,” she said, looking down. “When I saw Wayne\nusing his Slider ability, I started to get self-conscious. You see, I’m a\nPulser.”\nAs he’d suspected. “I think that could be very useful.”\n“Not really,” she said. “Speeding up time … that is amazing. But what\ncan one do with slowing it down, and only for myself? It’s useless in a fight.\nEveryone else would move with great speed around me. My father was\nashamed of the power. Told me to keep it quiet, much like my parentage.”\n“Your father,” Waxillium said, “is someone that I’m increasingly certain\nis a fool. You have access to something useful. No, it won’t fit every\nsituation, but no tool does.”\n“If you say so,” she said.\nA merchant came down the train aisle, selling pretzels, and Wayne all but\nleaped out of his chair to get one. Waxillium settled back, looking out the\nwindow, thinking.\nMiles. No, he couldn’t be sure it was him. When Waxillium had shot the\nVanisher boss in the face and dropped him, he’d assumed that he’d\nmistaken the voice. Miles wouldn’t drop to a gunshot.\nUnless he’d known that he had to feign a wound, lest Waxillium\nrecognize him. Miles was crafty enough for something like that.\nIt is him, Waxillium thought. He’d known it from the first time the\nVanisher boss had spoken. He just hadn’t wanted to admit it.\nThis complicated things immensely. And, oddly, Waxillium found\nhimself feeling overwhelmed.

Twenty years as a lawkeeper, and this\nsituation was already messier than any he’d investigated. He’d assumed that\nthe Roughs made him strong, but there’d also been a simplicity to life out\nthere, a simplicity he’d gotten used to.\nNow he came charging in, guns raised, assuming he could handle a\nproblem built on Elendel’s scale. He assumed he could take down a team\nthat was so well funded it could field men with guns made of something so\nexpensive it might as well have been gold.\nMaybe we should take it to the constables, Marasi had said. But could\nhe?\nHe fingered the earring in his pocket. He’d felt that Harmony wanted him\nto do this, to investigate. But what was Harmony but an impression in\nWaxillium’s mind? Confirmation bias, they called it. He felt what he\nexpected to. That was what his logical brain said.\nI wish I could feel the mists, he thought. It’s been weeks since I’ve been\nable to go out in them. He always felt stronger in the mists. He felt like\nsomeone was watching, when he was out in them.\nI have to continue with this, he told himself. He’d tried abstaining, and it\nhad led to Lord Peterus being shot. Waxillium’s usual method was to just\ntake command and do what needed to be done. It was the way a lawman\nlearned to work, out in the Roughs. We aren’t so different, Miles and I, he\nthought. Perhaps that was what had always frightened him so much about\nthe man.\nThe train slowed, pulling into their station.\n12\nWayne stepped out of the carriage, following Waxillium and Marasi. He\nlooked up to the carriage man, tossing him a coin. “We’ll need you to wait a\nspell, mate. I trust it won’t be a problem.”\nThe carriage man looked at the coin and raised an eyebrow. “No problem\nat all, mate.”\n“That’s quite the hat,” Wayne said.\nThe carriage man wore a round cap of stiff felt, conical, but with a flat\ntop and a feather on it. “We all wear ’em,” he said. “Mark of Gavil’s\nCarriages, you see.”\n“Huh. Wanna trade?”\n“What? Trade hats?”\n“Sure,” Wayne said, tossing up his flimsy knit cap.\nThe man caught it. “I’m not sure…”\n“I’ll throw in a pretzel,” Wayne said, fishing it out of his pocket.\n“Er…” The man looked down at the coin in his hand, which was quite\nsubstantial. He pulled off his cap and tossed it down to Wayne. “No need. I\nguess … I’ll just buy another.”\n“Mighty nice of you,” Wayne said, taking a bite from the pretzel as he\nsauntered after Waxillium. He put the cap on. It wasn’t a terribly good fit.\nHe hurried to catch up to the other two, who had stopped on a small hill.\nWayne breathed in, smelling the humidity of the canal, the scents of wheat\nin the fields and flowers at their feet.

That made him very sick, but he could sleep it off and drink a lot to\npass the time.\nThis was worse. Filling his metalmind as much as he dared, storing up\nhealth as they went about, meant he got sick. Fast. He sneezed a lot more,\nhis throat grew sore, and his eyes watered. He felt tired and groggy, too. But\nhe’d need that health, so he did it.\nHe walked across the grass. The Outer Estates were an odd place. The\nRoughs were dry and dirty. The City was densely populated and—in places\n—grimy. Out here, things were just … nice.\nA little too nice. Made his shoulders itch. This was the kind of place\nwhere a man would work in the field during the day, then go home and sit\non his porch, drinking lemonade and petting his dog. Men died of boredom\nin places like that.\nOdd, that in a place so open, he could feel even more anxious and\nconfined than when locked in a cell.\n“The last railway robbery happened here,” Waxillium said. He held out\nhis hand to the tracks—which rounded a bend just to their left—then moved\nhis hand along their path, as if seeing something Wayne wasn’t. He often\ndid things like that.\nWayne yawned, then took another bite of his pretzel. “What whasdat, sir?\nWhat whazzat sir? What whassat, sir?”\n“Wayne, what are you babbling about?” Waxillium turned, inspecting the\ncanal to the right. It was wide and deep here, intended for carrying barges\nfull of food into the city.\n“Practicing my pretzel guy,” Wayne said. “He had a great accent. Must\nhave been from one of the new rim towns, right by the southern\nmountains.”\nWaxillium glanced at him. “That hat looks ridiculous.”\n“Fortunately, I can change hats,” Wayne said in the pretzel-guy accent,\n“while you, sir, are stuck with that face.”\n“You two sound a lot like siblings,” Marasi said, watching curiously. “Do\nyou realize that?”\n“So long as I’m the handsome one,” Wayne said.\n“The tracks here bend toward the canal,” Waxillium said. “The other\nrobberies all happened near canals as well.”\n“As I recall,” Marasi noted, “most of the railway lines parallel the canals.\nThe canals were here first, and when the tracks were laid, it made sense to\nfollow the established paths.”\n“Yes,” Waxillium said. “But it’s especially striking here. Look how close\nthe tracks get to the canal.”\nHis accent is changing, Wayne thought. Only six months back in the city,\nand it already shows. It’s more refined in some ways, less formal in others.\nDid people see how their voices were like living things? Move a plant, and\nit would change and adapt to the environment around it. Move a person, and\nthe way they talked would grow, adapt, evolve.\n“So that machinery the Vanishers are using,” Marasi said, “you’re"

Move a person, and\nthe way they talked would grow, adapt, evolve.\n“So that machinery the Vanishers are using,” Marasi said, “you’re\nthinking they can’t move it far on land? They have to ship it up the canal,\nand pick a place near the tracks to set it up and carry out their robbery?”\nHer accent … Wayne thought. She uses more elevated diction around him\nthan around me. She tried so hard to impress Wax. Did he see it? Probably\nnot. The man had always been oblivious about women. Even Lessie.\n“Yes,” Waxillium said, hiking down the hillside. “The question is, how\ndid this thing—whatever it is—empty the freight cars so quickly and\nefficiently?”\n“Why is that so odd?” Wayne said, following him. “If I’d been a\nVanisher, I’d have brought a whole heap of men. That would let me finish\nthe work faster.”\n“This isn’t a question of simple manpower,” Waxillium said. “The train\ncars were locked, and some of the later ones had guards inside. When the\ncars arrived at their destination, they were still locked, but empty. Beyond\nthat, from one of the cars, many heavy ingots of iron were stolen. There’s a\nbottleneck at the car door—beyond a certain point, more men wouldn’t\nhave helped. There is no way they unloaded hundreds of ingots in under\nfive minutes using just manpower.”\n“A speed bubble?” Marasi asked.\n“Could have helped,” Wax said, “but not much. You’d have the same\nbottleneck, and you can’t fit many people in a speed bubble. Let’s say you\ncould have six workers inside, which would be really tight. They’d have to\nmove the iron ingots up to the edge of the speed bubble, then drop the\nbubble and create another—you can’t move the bubbles once they’re up—\nand repeat.”\nWax shook his head, hands on hips. “The cost in bendalloy would be\nincredible. With one nugget worth about five hundred notes, Wayne can\ncompress about two minutes into fifteen external seconds. To compress time\nequal to five minutes on the outside—gaining you enough time on the\ninside to move all of those iron bars—you’d need to spend ten thousand\nnotes. The bars would be worth just a fraction of that; Harmony, you could\nbuy your own train for that kind of money. I don’t believe it. Something\nelse is happening here.”\n“Machinery of some sort,” Marasi said.\nWax nodded, walking down the hillside, scanning the ground. “Let’s see\nif we can find any traces they may have left behind. Maybe the machinery\nhad wheels that left ruts or tracks.”\nWayne shoved his hands in his pockets and walked about, making a show\nof looking, but the whole reason he’d come to get Waxillium involved in\nthis investigation was because he was good at this kind of stuff. If there\nwere people involved, Wayne was quite handy. But flowers and dirt … not\nso much.\nAfter a few minutes, Wayne was bored, so he wandered over to where\nMarasi was looking. She glanced at him. “I do have to say, Wayne … that\nhat does not fit you very well.”"

You were the one who let the man take your old one from you.”\n“He convinced me not to fight back,” Wayne grumbled. Seemed obvious\nto him. “And then, he shot the guy wearing it, and the guy walked away!”\n“He couldn’t have known the man would survive.”\n“He shoulda grabbed my hat,” Wayne said.\nShe smiled, looking bemused.\nMost people, they didn’t understand hats, and Wayne didn’t really blame\nthem. Until you’d had a good, lucky hat, you wouldn’t understand the value\nof it. “It’s actually all right,” Wayne said softly, kicking around in the\nweeds. “But don’t tell Wax.”\n“What?”\n“I needed to lose that hat,” Wayne admitted. “Otherwise, it would have\nbeen blown up in the explosion, see? It was lucky it got stolen. It could\nhave ended up like my duster.”\n“You’re a very unique individual, Wayne.”\n“Technically, we all are,” he said. Then he hesitated. “Except for twins, I\nguess. Anyway, there’s something I’ve been wanting to ask you. It’s a little\npersonal, though.”\n“How personal?” she asked.\n“Well, you know, about yourself and all. The personal kind of personal. I\nguess.”\nShe looked at him, frowning, then blushed. Seemed the girl did that a lot,\nwhich was just fine by Wayne. Girls were pretty with a bit of color on them.\n“You don’t mean about me … and you … I mean…”\n“Oh, Harmony!” Wayne laughed. “It’s not anythin’ like that, mate. Don’t\nworry. You’re pretty enough, particularly through the coppers, if you know\nwhat I mean.”\n“The coppers?”\n“Sure. Word with a lot of curves, like you. You have a pretty accent too,\nand some nice bounce to you in the cloud area.”\n“Dare I ask what that is?”\n“The white, puffy things that float high above the fruitful land where the\nseeds are planted.”\nShe blushed even further. “Wayne! That might be the most crude thing\nanyone has ever said to me.”\n“I strives for excellence, mate. I strives for excellence. But don’t worry—\nlike I said, you’re right nice, but you ain’t got enough punch for me. I like\nwomen what could take my face clean off with a good roundhouse.”\n“You prefer women who could beat you up?”\n“Sure. It’s a thing. Anyway, what I was talkin’ about was your\nAllomancy. See, you and I, we have opposite powers. I speed up time, you\nslow it. So what happens if we both use it at the same time? Eh?”\n“It’s been documented,” Marasi said. “They cancel one another out.\nNothing happens.”\n“Really?”\n“Yes.”\n“Huh,” he said, wiping his nose with his handkerchief. “Most expensive\n‘nothing’ a person could find, what with us both burning rare metals.”"

You can use\nyour power to gain extra time. I can only use mine to lose time.”\n“Sure, but maybe sometime you want a certain day to come along sooner.\nYou want it real badly, right? So you can burn some chromium, and poof,\nit’s here!”\n“I’ve…” She looked embarrassed. “I’ve actually done that. Chromium\nburns way more slowly than bendalloy.”\n“See! Advantages. How big can your bubbles get?”\n“I can make one the size of a small room.”\n“That’s way bigger than mine,” Wayne said.\n“Multiply zero by a thousand, and you still get zero.”\nHe hesitated. “You do?”\n“Er, yes,” she said. “It’s basic mathematics.”\n“I thought we were talking about Allomancy. When did it become about\nmathematics?”\nThat made her blush too. You expected that out of a girl when you talked\nabout her more attractive body parts, but not when you mentioned\nmathematics. She was an odd alloy, this one.\nShe glanced to the side, toward Waxillium. He was crouching down\nbeside the canal.\n“Now him,” Wayne said. “He likes ’em smart.”\n“I have no intentions toward Lord Ladrian,” she said quickly. Too\nquickly.\n“Pity,” Wayne said. “I think he likes you, mate.”\nThat might have been an exaggeration. Wayne wasn’t certain what Wax\nwas thinking in regards to Marasi—however, the man needed to get his\nmind off Lessie. Lessie had been a great girl. Wonderful, and all that. But\nshe was dead, and Wax still had that … hollow look to him. The same one\nhe’d displayed in the weeks after Lessie’s death. It was softer now, but still\nthere.\nA new love would help a lot. Wayne was certain of it, so he found\nhimself quite pleased with himself as Marasi started moving, eventually\nwandering over to where Wax was working. She touched his arm, and he\npointed at something on the ground beside the canal. Together, they\ninspected it.\nWayne strolled over.\n“… perfectly rectangular,” Marasi was saying. “From something\nmechanical.”\nThe ground here was pressed down as if by something heavy in a square\npatch. It was apparently the only kind of track in the area, and didn’t seem\nwhat Wax had been intending to find. He knelt beside it, frowning, and\npressed his hand into the dirt, probably to check how compact it was. He\nlooked up at the tracks again.\n“Not enough footprints,” Wax said softly. “There’s no way this was\ncarried out with manpower. Even if there was a speed-bubble.”"

The car thumped beneath him, fields\nspeeding by outside.\nWhere would Miles be hiding? Waxillium’s mind went in loops. The City\noffered too many places to hide, and Miles wasn’t a typical criminal. He\nwas a former lawkeeper. Waxillium’s normal instincts would be off.\nHe’ll want to scale back, Waxillium decided. He’s careful. Judicious. He\nspent months between stealing the aluminum and making his next robbery.\nMiles had lost men and resources. He’d hide for a time. But where?\nWaxillium leaned against the corridor wall. This first-class railcar was made\nup of private compartments. He could faintly hear people talking in the one\nbeside him. Children. It had been a long walk through six railcars to find the\none with an available washroom. Wayne and Marasi were in a compartment\nseveral cars farther along.\nIf Marasi was right about the intended function of the kidnapped women,\nthen a grim fate awaited them. Miles could afford to step back, let the trail\ngrow cold. Each hour delayed would make him that much more difficult to\nfind.\nNo, Waxillium thought. He’ll need one more heist. A quick one, perhaps\nwithout any hostages, to get more aluminum. Waxillium had looked over\nthe original theft reports, and had managed to make an accurate assessment\nof the amount of aluminum Tekiel had been smuggling. It would have\nbarely been enough to outfit thirty or forty men. That would leave Miles\nneeding one more heist before going to ground; that way, he could use the\ndowntime to make more guns and ammunition.\nThat left Waxillium with one more opportunity to catch him. If he could\nset it up right. He—\nThe scream was faint, but Waxillium had trained himself to be vigilant\nfor such things. Always alert, especially when he was busy thinking. He\nimmediately threw himself to the side, which saved his life as the bullet\nripped through the glass window at the end of the railcar.\nWaxillium twisted, pulling a revolver from its holster. A figure in black\nstood in the next car, looking through the broken window. He wore the\nmask again, eyes exposed, knit covering the rest of his features. The build\nwas right, though—and the height, even the way he held his gun.\nIdiot! Waxillium thought. His instincts had been off. An ordinary\ncriminal would have gone to ground. But not Miles. He was a former\nlawman, accustomed to hunting rather than being hunted.\nAnd if you caused a twist in his plans, he’d come looking for you.\n13\nWaxillium didn’t have time to raise his weapon.

The glass windows exploded as the doors bent and ripped free,\nblocking the bullets as Miles fired three times in quick succession.\nThe car lurched as the train began a turn. Heads popped out of\ncompartments, wide eyes searching for the cause of the noise. Miles again\ntook aim down the corridor at Waxillium. Children nearby were crying.\nI can’t risk bystanders, Waxillium thought. I have to get out.\nAs the gun fired, Waxillium threw himself forward. A bullet ricocheted\nnear his head, spraying sparks. He couldn’t sense it Allomantically. It was\naluminum.\nWaxillium burst out into the space between railcars, wind roaring and\ntugging on his clothing. As Miles fired his sixth shot, Waxillium Pushed on\nthe couplers below and launched himself upward.\nHe soared into the air above the railcars. The wind caught him, pushing\nhim backward as he fell. He landed with a thump on the roof several cars to\nthe rear, going down on one knee and steadying himself with his free hand,\nwind blasting his hair and catching his jacket. He raised his revolver.\nMiles was here. On the train.\nI could stop him now. End this.\nThe next thought was immediate. How in the world was he going to stop\nMiles Hundredlives?\nA masked figure rose between the train cars just ahead—maybe only ten\nfeet away—holding a big-bore pistol. Miles always had preferred firepower\nto accuracy. He’d once said that he’d rather miss a few times knowing that\nwhen he did hit, the person he shot wouldn’t be getting up again.\nWaxillium cursed and filled his metalmind, dropping his weight to almost\nnothing, then rolled to the right, off the roof and over the side of the railcar.\nGunshots followed. He grabbed the rim of a window, pressing himself\nagainst the side of the car and wedging one foot down into a slot in the\nmetal along the car’s side. His decreased weight allowed him to hold\nhimself there easily, though his light body was buffeted by the wind.\nFar ahead, the engine belched cinders and black smoke; below, the tracks\nwere a-thunder. Waxillium raised his revolver in his right hand and waited\nas he clung to the side of the car with one hand and leg.\nMiles’s masked head soon poked out between the cars. Waxillium fired a\nsingle quick shot, Pushing the bullet forward with Allomancy for extra\nspeed against the howling wind. He nailed Miles right in the left eye socket.\nThe man’s head snapped backward, and blood sprayed against the side of\nthe railcar behind him. He stumbled, and Waxillium shot again, hitting him\nin the forehead.\nThe man reached up and ripped off his mask, revealing a hawk-like face\nwith short black hair and prominent eyebrows. It was him. Miles. A\nlawkeeper, a man who should have known better. A Twinborn Compounder\nof awesome power. His eye grew back, and the head wound was gone in an\neyeblink.

His\nmetalminds; they were spikes he wore driven through the skin of his lower\narm, like bolts. Metal that pierced skin was extremely difficult to touch with\nSteelpushing.\nRust and Ruin! Even getting shot in the eye hadn’t slowed him much.\nWaxillium sighted on an approaching tree and fired, then let go of the train\nand made himself as light as he could. He blew backward in the wind, and\nas the tree whipped past, he Pushed on the bullet lodged in it, shoving\nhimself to the side, between two train cars. He crouched there, gasping,\nheart pounding as another of Miles’s bullets ricocheted off the corner near\nhim.\nHow did you fight someone who was virtually immortal?\nSkirting some low hills, the railway rounded another curve. Verdant\nfarms and placid orchards rolled past in the near distance. Waxillium\ngrabbed the car’s ladder and pulled himself up, carefully peeking over the\nedge of the roof.\nMiles was charging toward him at full speed along the top of the railcar.\nWaxillium cursed, raising his gun as Miles did the same. Waxillium got his\nshot off first, and managed to hit Miles, who was only a few steps away by\nthat point.\nWaxillium aimed for the gun hand.\nThe bullet ripped into the flesh and bone, causing Miles to curse,\ndropping his gun. The weapon bounced once on the roof, then disappeared\nover the side. Waxillium smiled in satisfaction. Miles growled, then leaped\nforward off the top of the railcar and slammed into him.\nWaxillium’s head cracked back against the metal behind him, pain\nsending a flash of white across his vision. He grunted, dazed. Idiot! Most\nmen would never have jumped like that; it was too likely to toss both of\nthem off the moving train. That wouldn’t bother Miles.\nThey had both fallen into the space between railcars, standing on the\nprecarious footing there. Miles grabbed Waxillium by the vest with both\nhands, lifting him and slamming him back against the railcar behind.\nWaxillium reflexively fired again and again into Miles’s gut at point-blank\nrange, but the bullets ripped out of Miles’s back without even giving him\npause. He pulled Waxillium forward and punched him across the face.\nPain flashed, and Waxillium’s vision swam. He almost stumbled off and\nfell onto the speeding tracks just below. Desperate, Waxillium tried to Push\nhimself up into the air. Miles was ready for this, and as soon as Waxillium\nstarted to rise, the other man hooked his foot under the bottom ladder rung\nand held on. Waxillium lurched, still feeling dazed, but didn’t go into the\nair. He Pushed harder, but Miles hung on, eyes determined.\n“You can rip the tendons in my foot, Wax,” Miles yelled over the racket\nof wheels on the rails below and the howl of the wind, “but they’ll reknit\nimmediately. I think your body will give out before mine does. Push harder.\nLet’s see what happens.”"

Push harder.\nLet’s see what happens.”\nWaxillium let go, dropping back to the landing between cars. He tried to\ngrab Miles in a headlock as he came down, but the other man was younger,\nfaster, and a better brawler. Miles ducked—still holding on to Waxillium’s\nvest—then pulled. Waxillium stumbled, off balance, as he lurched into\nMiles, who drove his fist into Waxillium’s gut.\nWaxillium gasped at the pain. Miles grabbed Waxillium on the shoulder\nand pulled him forward, moving to bury his fist in Waxillium’s belly again.\nSo Waxillium increased his weight tenfold.\nMiles stumbled, suddenly pulling against something incredibly heavy.\nHis eyes went wide. He was used to dealing with Coinshots—they were one\nof the most common types of Allomancer, particularly among criminals.\nFeruchemists were far more rare. Miles knew what Waxillium was, but\nknowing about a power and anticipating it were different things.\nStill aching and breathless from the punch, Waxillium threw his shoulder\ninto Miles’s chest, using his enormous weight to press Miles backward. The\nman cursed, then let go of Wax and swung away, quickly climbing up the\nladder back to the railcar’s roof.\nWax stopped tapping his metalmind and Pushed, throwing himself\nupward. He landed on the other car, facing Miles across the small gap.\nWind played with their clothing and fields passed on either side. The train\nswayed as it crossed a switch, and the unsteady footing made Waxillium\nwobble. He bent down on one knee, pressing one hand against the rooftop\nand increasing his weight to steady himself. Miles stood tall, obviously\nindifferent to the shaky footing.\nIndistinctly, Waxillium could hear people crying out, probably as they\nmoved into other cars, trying to get away from the fighting. With luck the\ndisturbance would draw Wayne.\nMiles reached for the gun at his other hip. Waxillium reached for his\nother gun as well; he’d dropped the first—the better of the two—in the\nfighting. His vision was still fuzzy, his heart racing, but he still got his gun\nleveled at almost exactly the same instant as Miles. Each fired.\nA bullet grazed Wax’s side, cutting through his coat and drawing blood.\nHis own shot took Miles in the kneecap, making him stumble, knocking his\nnext shot wild. Wax took careful aim, then shot Miles in the hand, again\nblasting apart flesh and bone. Miles’s body immediately began to regrow\nitself, bone reassembling, sinew springing back like rubber, skin appearing\nlike ice growing over a pond. But the gun dropped.\nMiles reached for it. Wax casually lowered his gun and shot the other\nweapon, knocking it backward and off the shaking top of the train.\n“Dammit!” Miles swore. “Do you know how much those things are\nworth?”\nStill on one knee, Wax raised his gun beside his head, the wind of the\ntrain’s motion blowing the smoke away from the barrel.\nMiles rose to his feet again. “You know, Wax,” he yelled over the wind,"

A part of me always thought your\nsoftness would cause it—I thought you’d let someone go that you shouldn’t\nhave. I wondered if I’d have a chance to hunt you down for it.”\nWaxillium didn’t respond. He maintained a level gaze, face impassive.\nOn the inside, he was smarting, trying to catch his breath from the beating\nhe’d taken. He raised his hand to his side, pressing it against the wound.\nBlessedly, it wasn’t too bad, but it still wet his fingers with blood. The train\nswayed, and he quickly lowered his hand to the rooftop again.\n“What was it that broke you, Miles?” Waxillium called. “The lure of\nwealth?”\n“You know very well this isn’t about money.”\n“You need gold,” Waxillium yelled. “Don’t deny it. You’ve always\nneeded it, for your constant Compounding.”\nMiles didn’t reply.\n“What happened?” Waxillium yelled. “You were a lawkeeper, Miles. A\ndamn good one.”\n“I was a dog, Wax. A hound, kept in line with false promises and stern\norders.” Miles backed up a few paces, then ran forward, leaping over the\ngap between them.\nWaxillium stood warily and backed up.\n“Don’t tell me you never felt it,” Miles yelled, snarling. “You worked\nevery day to fix the world, Wax. You tried to end the pain, the violence, the\nrobberies. It never worked. The more men you put down, the more troubles\narose.”\n“It’s the life of a lawkeeper,” Waxillium said. “If you gave up, fine. But\nyou didn’t have to join the other side.”\n“I was already on the other side,” Miles said. “Where do the criminals\ncome from? Was it the shopkeeper next door who started rampaging and\nmurdering? Was it the boys who grew up near town, working their father’s\ndry farm?\n“No. It was the mine workers, shipped out from the City to dig into the\ndepths and exploit the latest rich find—then be abandoned once it was\nexhausted. It was the fortune hunters. It was the rich fools from the City\nwho wanted adventure.”\n“I don’t care who it was,” Waxillium said, still backing up. He was on the\nnext-to-last car. He was running out of space to retreat. “I served the law.”\n“I served it too,” Miles called. “But now I serve something better. The\nessence of the law, but mixed with real justice. An alloy, Wax. The best\nparts of both made into one. I do something better than chase the filth sent\nto me from the city.\n“You can’t tell me you never noticed it. What of Pars the Deadman, your\n‘great catch’ of the last five years? I remember you hunting him, I\nremember your nights without sleep, your anxiety.

        "text": "the center of Weathering when he left old Burlow’s daughter dead for you to\nfind. Where did he come from?”\nWaxillium didn’t reply. Pars had been a murderer from the City, a butcher\nwho had been caught killing beggars. He’d fled out into the Roughs, and\nthere he had again worked to sate his grisly obsession.\n“They didn’t stop him,” Miles spat, stepping forward. “They didn’t send\nyou help. They didn’t care about the Roughs. Nobody cares about the\nRoughs—they barely seem to notice us save as a place to deposit their\ntrash.”\n“So you rob them,” Wax called. “Kidnap their daughters, murder any\nwho stand in your way?”\nMiles took another step forward. “I do what needs to be done, Wax. Isn’t\nthat the code of the lawkeeper? I haven’t stopped being one; you never stop\nbeing a lawkeeper. It gets in you. You do what nobody else will. You stand\nup for the downtrodden, make things better, stop the criminals. Well, I’ve\njust decided to set my sights on a more powerful brand of criminal.”\nWaxillium shook his head. “You’ve let yourself become a monster,\nMiles.”\n“You say that,” Miles said, wind whipping at his short hair, “but your\neyes, Wax … they show the truth. I can see it. You do get what I’m saying.\nYou’ve felt it too. You know that I’m right.”\n“I’m not going to join you.”\n“I’m not asking you to,” Miles said, voice growing softer. “You’ve\nalways been the good hound, Wax. If your master beats you, you just\nwhimper and wonder how to better serve. I don’t think we’d work well\ntogether. Not in this.”\nMiles lunged forward.\nWaxillium dumped all of his weight into his metalmind and hopped\nbackward, letting the wind grab and drag him a good twenty feet away. He\nincreased his weight and landed on the last railcar. They were approaching\nthe suburbs; the flora of the Outer Estates dwindled.\n“Go ahead and run!” Miles called. “I’ll just wander back and take little\nLady Harms the bastard! And Wayne. I’ve long been wanting an excuse to\nput a bullet in that man’s head.” He turned and began to stroll in the other\ndirection.\nWaxillium cursed, dashing forward. Miles turned, his lips spreading in a\ncold smile. He reached down, pulling a long-bladed knife out of the back of\nhis boot. It was aluminum; he didn’t have a single Allomantically reactive\npiece of metal on his body that Waxillium could see.\nI need to throw him off the train, Wax thought. He couldn’t beat Miles\nhere, not for good. He needed a more controlled environment. And he\nneeded time to plan.\nAs he got close, Wax raised his gun and tried to blast the knife out of\nMiles’s hand—but the other man spun the knife and rammed it through his\nown left forearm, jamming it right down through the flesh so it stuck out the\nbottom. He didn’t even flinch. Stories told all around the Roughs claimed\nthat after suffering hundreds of wounds that should have killed him, Miles\nhad grown completely oblivious to pain."

Stories told all around the Roughs claimed\nthat after suffering hundreds of wounds that should have killed him, Miles\nhad grown completely oblivious to pain.\nMiles held his hands out, ready to grab Waxillium—but he’d also be able\nto whip out that knife in a flash. Waxillium got out his own knife and held it\nin his left hand. The two circled for a moment, Wax’s increased weight\nhelping to steady him atop the thumping train car. It still wasn’t terribly sure\nfooting, and sweat trickled down his brow, blown sideways by the wind.\nA few fools poked their heads up between distant cars, trying to watch\nthe action. Unfortunately, none of those fools was Wayne. Wax feinted\nforward with a quick step, but Miles didn’t take the bait. Wax was only a\nfair knife fighter, and Miles was known as one of the best. But if Wax could\nroll them both off the train …\nAt this speed, it will end me, but not him, he thought. Unless I can get a\nPush underneath me. Rusts. This is going to be hard.\nHe had only one chance, and that was to end the fight quickly.\nMiles came in to seize him. Wax took a breath and stepped into it, which\nMiles seemed to find surprising, though he still managed to grab Wax’s arm.\nWith his other hand, Miles pulled the knife free from his own arm,\npreparing to thrust it toward Wax. In desperation, Wax increased his weight\nand threw his shoulder into Miles’s chest.\nUnfortunately, Miles anticipated that move. He dropped to the roof,\nrolling, and kicked Wax in the legs.\nIn the blink of an eye, Wax was tumbling through the air toward the\ngravel and rock beside the railway tracks. Some primal part of him knew\nwhat to do. He Pushed on the knife in his hand, ripping it free and plunging\nit into the earth directly below him. That bounced him into the air as he\nsimultaneously shed his weight. The wind caught him. He was spinning,\nand he lost all sense of direction.\nHe hit and rolled into a heap, slamming against something hard. He\nstopped moving, but his vision continued to lurch. The sky spun.\nAll grew still. His vision slowly returned to normal. He was alone in the\nmiddle of a weedy field. The train was puffing away down the tracks.\nHe groaned and rolled over. A man my age shouldn’t be doing this kind of\nthing, he thought, stumbling to his feet. He hadn’t started feeling his age\nuntil the last few years, but he was over forty now. That was ancient by\nRoughs standards.\nHe stared after the escaping railway train, shoulder aching. The thing\nwas, Miles had said one thing that was right.\nYou never stopped being a lawkeeper.\nWax gritted his teeth and dashed forward. He scooped up the gun he’d\ndropped when falling—it was easy to find with his Allomancy—then\njumped without breaking stride and landed atop the tracks.\nHe Pushed, throwing himself into the air. He reached a good height, then\nShoved on the rails behind him, shooting forward. A careful Push below, a\ncontinuous Push behind. The wind roared around him, his clothing a noisy\nflurry, blood seeping from the wound at his side."

The wind roared around him, his clothing a noisy\nflurry, blood seeping from the wound at his side.\nThere was a thrill to this, the flight of a Coinshot. It was a freedom no\nother Allomancer could know. When the air became his, he felt the same\nexhilaration he had years ago, when he’d first sought his fortune in the\nRoughs. He wished that he were wearing his mistcoat and that the mists\nwere around him. Everything always seemed to work better in the mists.\nThey were said to protect the just.\nHe caught up to the train in moments, then threw himself in a powerful\narc over it. A small figure was walking along the tops of the railcars,\nmaking his way toward Wayne and Marasi.\nWax Pushed downward to keep himself from hitting too hard, but\nincreased his weight at the same time, slamming into the train’s roof and\ndenting it into a crater around him. He stood up straight, then flipped his\nrevolver open, as if to reload. The casings and unspent rounds flipped up\ninto the air and he caught one.\nMiles spun. Wax tossed the cartridge at him.\nLooking startled, Miles snatched it out of the air.\n“Goodbye,” Wax said, then slammed as powerful a Push as he could into\nthat cartridge.\nMiles’s eyes opened wide. His hand jerked backward into his chest, and\nthen he was flung free of the train, the Push on the cartridge effectively\ntransferred to him. The train rounded a bend as Miles soared through the air\nand crashed into the rocky ground beyond.\nWax sat down, then lay back, eyes toward the sky. He breathed in deeply,\naching, and pressed his hand to the wound at his side. He rode all the way\nto the next stop before climbing down.\n* * *\n“We had orders, m’lord,” the railway engineer said. “Even when I heard\nthere was gunfire back in the passenger cars. We ain’t to stop for anything.\nThe Vanishers get you when you stop.”\n“It is just as well,” Waxillium said, gladly taking a cup of water from a\nyoung man in an apprentice engineer’s vest. “If you had stopped, it likely\nwould have meant my death.”\nHe sat in a small room at the station, which—by tradition—was owned\nand operated by a minor member of the house that owned the land nearby.\nThe lord himself was out, but the steward had immediately sent for the local\nsurgeon.\nWaxillium had his coat, vest, and shirt off, and was holding a bandage to\nhis side. He wasn’t certain he had time to wait for that surgeon. It would\ntake Miles about an hour of running to reach this station. Fortunately, he\nwasn’t a steel Feruchemist, capable of increasing his speed.\nAn hour, likely, but it was best to plan for the worst. If Miles found a\nhorse, he could arrive sooner. And Waxillium wasn’t certain exactly how\nMiles’s Compounding would affect his stamina. Perhaps he might be\ncapable of running longer distances than he should be able to.\n“We almost have your men out, m’lord,” another apprentice said,"

Miles had planned his trap well. Wayne and\nMarasi had been confined in their car—along with all the others who\nhappened to be there—by lengths of metal jammed into locking\nmechanisms on the outer doors. Miles had waited until Waxillium left his\nroom, then had quietly trapped the others before hunting him.\nThere was some luck to that, at least. Miles hadn’t simply killed them. It\nmade sense that he hadn’t, however. It would have been risky, going in to\ntry to kill Wayne—who could heal himself—and risk drawing Waxillium\nback, then facing one on either side. Miles was too careful for that.\nWaxillium had been the real target. The others were better locked away\nuntil the primary goal was accomplished.\n“You need to get your train going again,” Waxillium said to the engineer.\nHe was a heavyset man with a dark brown beard and a flat-topped cap.\n“You are in danger from the Vanishers. We need to ride the train all the way\ninto the heart of the City. We can’t delay.”\n“But your wound, m’lord!”\n“It will be fine,” Waxillium said. Out in the Roughs, he’d often had to go\ndays or weeks with a wound before a surgeon could tend it.\n“We—”\nThe door burst open and Marasi stumbled through. Her blue dress was\nstill singed from the explosion at the mansion, but she wore it well, despite\nthe folds of lace underneath the glistening outer layer. The blue vest that\npulled closed around the bodice was missing a button on the bottom,\nprobably ripped free in the fall. He hadn’t noticed that before.\nShe raised her hands to her mouth at the sight of the bloody bandage,\nthen immediately turned beet red at seeing him with his shirt off. He did\nhave a moment of pride in the fact that, though he had some gray in his hair,\nhe still had the lean muscles of a much younger man.\n“Oh, Harmony!” she said. “Are you all right? Is that your blood? And\nshould I be in here? I can go. I should probably go, shouldn’t I? Are you\nsure you’re all right?”\n“He’ll live,” Wayne said, peeking in behind her. “Wha’d you do, Wax?\nTrip on the way out of the washroom?”\n“Miles found me,” Waxillium said, removing the bandage. It looked like\nthe wound had mostly stopped bleeding. He took another bandage from one\nof the apprentices, then prepared to tie it in place.\n“Is he dead?” Marasi asked.\n“I killed him a few more times,” Waxillium said, “and it was about as\neffective as what everyone else has tried.”\n“You need to get his metalminds off of ’im,” Wayne said. “It’s the only\nway.”\n“He keeps thirty different ones,” Waxillium said, “all piercing his skin,\nall with enough healing to bring him back from practically any wound.” A"

Miles could heal so quickly even that wouldn’t kill\nhim. He was said to keep the healing running constantly. From what\nWaxillium knew of Compounding, it could be very dangerous to stop once\nyou’d started.\n“Sounds like a challenge!” Wayne said.\nMarasi lingered in the doorway for a moment longer, then apparently\nmade a decision and rushed forward. “Let me see the wound,” she said,\nkneeling beside Waxillium’s bench.\nHe frowned, but stopped tying the bandage straps and let her peel back\nthe cloth. She inspected the wound.\n“You know something of surgery, m’lady?” the engineer said, shifting\nfrom foot to foot. He seemed a little anxious at her presence in the room.\n“I go to university,” she said.\nAh, that’s right, Waxillium thought.\n“So?” Wayne asked.\nMarasi prodded at the wound. “University rules, set by Harmony himself,\ndictate a broad education.”\n“Yeah, I know they have to take girls,” Wayne said.\nMarasi paused. “Er … not that meaning of broad, Wayne.”\n“Students have to be trained in a little of everything,” Waxillium said,\n“before they can choose a specialty.”\n“That includes basic healing and some small amount of surgery,” Marasi\nsaid. “As well as complete anatomy courses.”\nWayne frowned. “Wait. Anatomy. Meaning, all parts of anatomy.”\nMarasi blushed. “Yes.”\n“So—”\n“So it was very popular in class to watch my reactions, apparently,” she\nsaid, still blushing. “And I’d rather not dwell on that at the moment, Wayne,\nthank you. This needs stitches, Waxillium.”\n“Can you do it?”\n“Er … I’ve never worked on anyone alive before…”\n“Eh,” Wayne said, “I spent months training with dueling canes on\ndummies before beating up my first real person. It’s pretty much the same\nthing.”\n“I’ll be all right, Marasi,” Waxillium said.\n“So many scars,” she said quietly, as if not noticing what he’d said. She\nwas staring at his chest and sides, and seemed to be counting the old bullet\nwounds.\n“There are seven,” he said softly in reply, replacing the bandage and\ntying it tight.\n“You’ve been shot seven times?” she asked.\n“A lot of gunshots aren’t lethal, if you know how to care for them,”\nWaxillium said. “They don’t really—”\n“Oh,” she said, raising a hand to her lips. “I meant, we only have records\nof five. I really will need to hear about the other two sometime.”\n“Right,” he said, grimacing and standing. He waved for his shirt.\n“Oh, bother,” she said. “That didn’t come out very well, did it? I really\nam impressed that you have been shot so often. Really.”\n“Getting hit’s not really that impressive,” Wayne noted. “It don’t take\nmuch skill to get shot. It’s avoiding the bullets that’s tough.”"

It’s avoiding the bullets that’s tough.”\nWaxillium snorted, pulling his arm through a sleeve.\nMarasi stood. “I’ll turn around so you can dress,” she said, beginning to\nspin.\n“Turn around,” Waxillium said flatly.\n“Um, yes.”\n“So I can dress.”\n“A little silly, I guess.”\n“A little,” he said, smiling and pulling his other sleeve on. He began\ndoing the buttons. Wayne looked so amused he was having trouble standing\nup.\n“All right,” she said, raising her hands to the sides of her face. “I realize\nthat I get a little flustered sometimes. I’m just not used to things exploding,\npeople getting shot at, and finding my friends sitting and bleeding with their\nshirts off when I walk in! This is all very new to me.”\n“It’s all right,” Waxillium said, laying a hand on her shoulder. “There are\nmuch worse things to be than genuine, Marasi. Besides, Wayne wasn’t\nmuch better when he was new to all of this. Why, he used to get so nervous\nthat he would start—”\n“Hey,” Wayne said, “no use bringin’ that up.”\n“What?” Marasi asked, lowering her hands.\n“NOTHING,” Wayne replied. “Come on. We should move, right? If\nMister Miles Murderer is still alive, he’ll be wanting to shoot us, right? And\nas good as Wax is at getting shot—he’s had lots of practice, you see—I\nthink we best be avoiding more of that sort today.”\n“He’s right,” Waxillium said, pulling on his vest, then putting on his\nshoulder holsters. He winced.\n“Are you sure you’re all right?” Marasi asked.\n“He’s fine,” Wayne said, holding the door open for them. “I got quite\nnear my entire rusted back blown off earlier, if you’ll kindly recall, and I\ndidn’t hear nearly an ounce of the sympathy you’re showin’ him.”\n“That’s different,” Marasi said, walking past him.\n“What? Why? ’Cuz I can heal?”\n“No,” she said, “because—even after knowing you only a short time—\nI’m fairly certain that on one level or another, you deserve to get blown up\nevery now and again.”\n“Oi,” Wayne said. “That’s harsh.”\n“But untrue?” Waxillium said, pulling on his coat. It was looking quite\nragged.\n“Didn’t say that now, did I,” Wayne said, and sneezed. “Keep moving,\nslowboy. Rusts! A man gets shot, and he thinks he can take all afternoon.\nLet’s move!”\nWaxillium walked past. He forced himself to smile, though he was\nstarting to feel as ragged as his coat. There wasn’t much time. Miles had\ntaken off his mask, but had obviously expected to kill Waxillium. He now\nknew that he’d been outed, and that would make him even more dangerous.\nIf Miles and his people were going to strike for more aluminum, they’d\ndo it soon.

Waxillium\nexpected one soon; he’d read something in the broadsheets about House\nTekiel boasting of their new armored freight cars.\n“So what do we do when we get back?” Wayne asked softly as they\nwalked toward the railway car. “We’re going to need someplace safe to\nplan, right?”\nWaxillium sighed, knowing what Wayne was fishing for. “You’re\nprobably right.”\nWayne smiled.\n“You know,” Waxillium said, “I’m not sure I’d call any place near\nRanette ‘safe.’ Particularly if you are there.”\n“Better than being exploded,” Wayne said happily. “Mostly.”\n14\nWaxillium pounded on the door of the townhome. The area around them\nwas a typical Elendel neighborhood. Vibrant, lush walnut trees lined either\nside of the cobbled street. Even after seven months back in the city, the\ntrees still made him stare. Out in the Roughs, trees as large as these were\nrare. And here was an entire street full of them, mostly ignored by the\ninhabitants.\nHe, Wayne, and Marasi stood on the porch of the narrow, brick-faced\nhome. Before Waxillium had a chance to lower his hand, the door swung\nopen. A lean, long-legged woman stood inside. Her dark hair was pulled\nback into a shoulder-length tail, and she wore brown trousers and a Roughs-\nstyle long leather coat over a white, no-nonsense laced shirt. She took one\nlook at Waxillium and Wayne, then slammed the door shut without saying a\nword.\nWaxillium glanced at Wayne, and then they both took a step to the side.\nMarasi looked at them in confusion until Waxillium took her by the arm and\npulled her over.\nThe door slammed back open, and the woman shoved a shotgun out. She\nglanced around the corner at the two of them, then narrowed her eyes.\n“I’ll count to ten,” she said. “One.”\n“Now, Ranette,” Waxillium began.\n“Two three four five,” she said in quick succession.\n“Do we really have to—”\n“Six seven eight.” She raised the gun, taking aim at them.\n“All right then…” Waxillium said, hustling down the steps, Wayne\nfollowing, hand holding his carriage man’s cap in place.\n“She wouldn’t really shoot us?” Marasi asked softly. “Would she?”\n“Nine!”\nThey reached the sidewalk beneath the towering trees. The door slammed\nclosed behind them.\nWaxillium took a deep breath, turning around and looking at the house.\nWayne leaned back against one of the tree trunks, smiling.\n“So, that went well,” Waxillium said.\n“Yup,” Wayne replied.\n“Well?” Marasi demanded.\n“Neither of us got shot,” Waxillium said. “You can’t always be sure, with\nRanette. Particularly if Wayne is along.”\n“Now, that’s right unfair,” Wayne said. “She’s only shot me three times.”\n“You’re forgetting Callingfale.”\n“That was in the foot,” Wayne said. “Barely counts.”\nMarasi pursed her lips, studying the building. “You two have some\ncurious friends.”"

Nah, she’s just angry.” Wayne smiled. “It’s how she shows\naffection.”\n“By shooting people?”\n“Ignore Wayne,” Waxillium said. “Ranette might be brusque, but she\nrarely shoots people other than him.”\nMarasi nodded. “So … should we go?”\n“Wait for a moment,” Waxillium said. To his side, Wayne started\nwhistling, then checked his pocket watch.\nThe door was flung open again, Ranette holding her shotgun up on her\nshoulder. “You’re not leaving!” she called.\n“I need your help,” Waxillium called back.\n“I need you to stick your head in a bucket of water and slowly count to a\nthousand!”\n“Lives are at stake, Ranette,” Waxillium yelled. “Innocent lives.”\nRanette raised her gun, taking aim.\n“Don’t worry,” Wayne said to Marasi. “At this distance, birdshot\nprobably won’t be lethal. Make sure your eyes are closed, though.”\n“You’re not helping, Wayne,” Waxillium said calmly. He was sure\nRanette wouldn’t shoot. Well, reasonably sure. Maybe.\n“Oh, you actually want me to help?” Wayne said. “Right. You still have\nthat aluminum gun I gave you?”\n“Tucked in the small of my back,” Waxillium said. “Without any\nbullets.”\n“Hey, Ranette!” Wayne called. “I’ve got a neat gun you can have!”\nShe hesitated.\n“Wait,” Waxillium said, “I wanted that—”\n“Don’t be a baby,” Wayne said to him. “Ranette, it’s a revolver made\nentirely of aluminum!”\nShe lowered her shotgun. “Really?”\n“Get it out,” Wayne whispered to Waxillium.\nWaxillium sighed, reaching under his coat. He held up the revolver,\ndrawing some looks from passersby on the street. Several of them spun\nabout and hastened in the other direction.\nRanette stepped forward. She was a Lurcher, and could recognize most\nmetals by simply burning iron. “Well then,” she called. “You should have\nmentioned that you’d brought a bribe. This might be enough to get me to\nforgive you!” She strolled down her front walk, shotgun slung up over her\nshoulder.\n“You realize,” Waxillium said under his breath, “that this revolver is\nworth enough to buy an entire houseful of guns? I think I might shoot you,\nfor this.”\n“The ways of Wayne are mysterious and incomprehensible,” Wayne said.\n“What he giveth, he can draw back unto himself. And lo, let it be written\nand pondered.”\n“You’ll ponder my fist, hitting your face.” Waxillium plastered a smile on\nhis lips as Ranette stepped up to them; then he reluctantly handed over the\nrevolver.\nShe looked it over with an expert eye. “Lightweight,” she said. “No\nmaker’s mark stamped on the barrel or the grip. Where’d you get this?”\n“The Vanishers,” Waxillium said."

Where’d you get this?”\n“The Vanishers,” Waxillium said.\n“Who?”\nWaxillium sighed. That’s right.\n“How could you not know who the Vanishers are?” Marasi blurted.\n“They’ve been on every broadsheet in the city for the last two months.\nThey’re all anyone is talking about.”\n“People are stupid,” Ranette said, popping the revolver open, checking\nthe chambers. “I find them annoying—and those are the ones I like. Did this\nhave aluminum rounds too?”\nWaxillium nodded. “We don’t have any of the pistol rounds. Just a few\nrifle rounds.”\n“How did they work?” she asked. “Stronger than lead, but much lighter.\nLess immediate stopping power, obviously, but they’ll still tear themselves\napart on hitting. Could be very deadly if they hit the right spot. And that’s\nassuming wind resistance doesn’t slow the bullets too much before they\nreach their target. The effective range would be way down. And they’d be\nhighly abrasive to the barrel.”\n“I haven’t fired it,” Waxillium said. He eyed Wayne, who was grinning.\n“We’ve … er, been saving it for you. And I’m sure the rounds are of a much\nheavier alloy than the revolver itself, though I didn’t get a chance to test\nthem yet. They’re lighter than lead rounds, but not even close to as light as\nnearly pure aluminum would be. The percentage is still high, but the alloy\nmust solve most of those issues somehow.”\nRanette grunted. She waved the gun absently toward Marasi. “Who’s the\nornament?”\n“A friend,” Waxillium said. “Ranette, people are looking for us.\nDangerous people. Can we come in?”\nShe tucked the revolver into her belt. “Fine. But if Wayne touches\nanything—anything—I’ll blow off the offending fingers.”\n* * *\nMarasi kept her tongue as they were led into the building. She wasn’t\nparticularly fond of being referred to as an “ornament.” But she was fond of\nremaining unshot, and so silence seemed prudent.\nShe was good at silence. She had been trained to it over two decades of\nlife.\nRanette closed the door behind them, then turned away. Shockingly, the\nlocks on the door all did themselves, twisting in their mounts and clicking.\nThere were nearly a dozen of them, and their sudden move caused Marasi\nto jump. What in the Survivor’s Deadly Name?\nRanette set her shotgun in a basket beside the door—it appeared that she\nkept it there the way ordinary people kept umbrellas—then sidled past them\nin the narrow hallway. She waved a hand, and some kind of lever beside the\ninterior door lurched. The door sprang open as she walked to it.\nRanette was an Allomancer. Of course. That was why she’d been able to\nrecognize the aluminum. As they reached the door, Marasi studied the\ncontraption that had opened it. There was a lever that could be pulled,\nwhich in turn moved a rope, pulley, and lever arrangement on the other\nside.\nThere’s one on each side, Marasi realized as they stepped through the"

She can open her doors from either direction without needing to\nlift a hand. It seemed an indulgence. But, then, who was Marasi to critique\nanother person’s use of their Allomancy? This would certainly be useful if\nyou often walked about with your hands full.\nThe living room beyond had been converted to a workshop. There were\nlarge worktables on all four sides, and nails had been pounded into the walls\nto hang an impressive variety of tools. Marasi didn’t recognize any of the\nmachinery that cluttered those tables, but there were a lot of clamps and\ngears. A disturbing number of electrical cords snaked across the floor.\nMarasi stepped very carefully. Electricity couldn’t be dangerous when it\nwas in cords, could it? She’d heard stories of people getting burned, as if\nstruck by lightning, from getting too close to electrical devices. And people\nspoke of using this power for everything—replacing horses with it, making\nmills that ground grain on their own, using it to power elevators.\nDisturbing. Well, she’d keep her distance.\nThe door slammed shut behind them in response to Ranette’s Allomancy.\nShe had to Pull on a lever for it, so that meant she was a Lurcher, not a\nCoinshot like Waxillium. Wayne was already poking through things on the\ndesks, completely ignoring her threat to his fingers.\nWaxillium surveyed the room, with its wires, windows—covered by\nshutters—and tools. “I assume it’s living up to your expectations?”\n“What?” Ranette asked. “The city? It’s a pit. I don’t feel half as safe here\nas I did out in the Roughs.”\n“Still can’t believe you abandoned us,” Wayne said, sounding hurt.\n“You didn’t have electricity,” Ranette said, sitting at her desk in a chair\nwith wheels on the bottom. She waved an absent hand, and a long, thin tool\nflipped out of a cubby on the wall. It flew toward her and she snatched it,\nthen brought it down and began prodding at the gun Waxillium had given\nher. From what Marasi understood, gestures weren’t needed for Pushing or\nPulling, but many used them anyway.\nRanette completely ignored her visitors as she worked. She Pulled a few\nmore tools without looking up, causing them to streak across the room to\nher. One nearly clipped Marasi on the shoulder.\nIt was unusual to see Allomancy used so casually, and Marasi wasn’t\ncertain what to make of it. On one hand, it was fascinating. On the other, it\nwas humbling. What would it be like, to have a power that was useful? Lord\nHarms had insisted that Marasi keep her ability—such as it was—quiet,\ncalling it unseemly. She could see through him. He wasn’t so much\nembarrassed to have an Allomancer daughter as to have one that was\nillegitimate. He couldn’t have Marasi looking like a better catch than Steris.\nBitter thoughts, she told herself, intentionally pushing them away.\nBitterness could consume a woman. Best to keep it at arm’s length."

Best to keep it at arm’s length.\n“This gun is good work,” Ranette said, though she sounded grudging.\nShe’d donned some spectacles with a magnifying lens on them, and was in\nthe process of staring down the barrel of the revolver while shining a small\nelectric light into it. “You want me to figure out who made this, I assume?”\nWaxillium turned to study a line of half-finished guns on one of the\ntables. “Actually,” he said, “we came here because we needed someplace\nsafe to think for a few hours.”\n“Your mansion isn’t safe?”\n“My butler failed to poison me, then tried to shoot me, then set off an\nexplosive in my study.”\n“Huh.” She cocked the pistol a few times. “You need to screen these\npeople better, Wax.”\n“I’ll take that under advisement.” He picked up a pistol and sighted down\nits barrel. “I’m going to need a new Sterrion.”\n“Like hell you will,” Ranette said. “What’s wrong with the ones you\nhave?”\n“Gave them to the aforementioned butler,” Waxillium said. “And he\nprobably dumped them in the canals.”\n“What of your Ambersairs? I made you one of those, didn’t I?”\n“You did. I lost it fighting Miles Dagouter earlier today.”\nThis made Ranette stop. She lowered the aluminum gun, then turned her\nchair. “What?”\nWaxillium drew his lips into a line. “He’s the one we’re hiding from.”\n“Why,” Ranette said pointedly, “is Miles Hundredlives trying to kill\nyou?”\nWayne strolled forward. “He’s trying to overthrow the city or something,\ndearie. For some reason, he thinks the best way to do that is by robbin’ folks\nand blowing up mansions.”\n“Don’t call me dearie.”\n“Sure thing, honey.”\nMarasi watched in silence, curious. Wayne seemed to like taunting this\nwoman. In fact, though he tried to act nonchalant, he kept glancing at her,\nand had been edging through the room closer and closer to her seat.\n“Whatever,” Ranette said, turning back to her work. “Don’t really care.\nBut you’re not getting a new Sterrion.”\n“Nobody else’s guns shoot as straight as yours, Ranette.”\nShe didn’t reply. She did glare at Wayne, who had moved up to the point\nwhere he was leaning over her shoulder and looking at the gun.\nWaxillium smiled, then turned back to the unfinished guns on the desk.\nMarasi joined him, uncertain what she should be doing. Hadn’t they come\nhere to plan their next move? Neither Waxillium nor Wayne seemed eager\nto get on with things.\n“Is there something between them?” Marasi whispered, nodding her head\ntoward Wayne and Ranette. “She acts a little like a jilted lover.”\n“Wayne could only wish,” Waxillium whispered back. “Ranette’s not\ninterested in him like that. I’m not certain she’s interested in any man like\nthat. Doesn’t stop him from trying, though.” He shook his head. “I’m half"

Doesn’t stop him from trying, though.” He shook his head. “I’m half\ntempted to think that all of this—coming to Elendel to investigate the\nVanishers, looking me up—was about eventually persuading me to come\nwith him to Ranette’s. He knew she wouldn’t let him in unless he was with\nme and we were doing something important.”\n“You’re a bizarre pair, you know.”\n“We try.”\n“So what’s our next move?”\n“I’m trying to decide. For now, if we linger long enough, she might give\nme a new revolver.”\n“Either that, or she’ll shoot you for annoying her.”\n“Nah. She’s never shot anyone after letting them in the door that I can\nrecall. Not even Wayne.” He hesitated. “She’ll probably let you stay here, if\nyou want. It would be safe. I’ll bet there’s a paid Coppercloud rotation\ngoing on in one of the nearby buildings, shrouding the area. Ranette hates\npeople sensing her Allomancy. I doubt there are half a dozen people in\nElendel who know she lives here. Harmony only knows how Wayne tracked\nher down.”\n“I’d rather not stay. Please, whatever you’re doing, I want to help.”\nHe picked something up off the desk; a small box of bullets. “I can’t\nfigure you out, Marasi Colms.”\n“You’ve solved some of the most troubling crimes the Roughs have ever\nknown, Lord Waxillium. I doubt I’m nearly as mysterious.”\n“Your father is very well off,” Waxillium said. “From what I know of\nhim, I’m certain he would have provided you with a comfortable\nendowment for the rest of your life. Instead, you attend university—\nchoosing one of the most difficult programs of study offered.”\n“You left a position of considerable comfort yourself,” she said,\n“choosing to live away from convenience and modernity.”\n“I did.”\nShe selected one of the bullets out of the box, holding it up, looking it\nover. She couldn’t see anything distinctive about it. “Have you ever felt you\nwere useless, Lord Waxillium?”\n“Yes.”\n“It’s difficult to imagine that of someone as accomplished as yourself.”\n“Sometimes,” he said, “accomplishment and perception can work\nindependently.”\n“True. Well, my lord, I have spent most of my life being politely told I\nwas useless. Useless to my father because of my birth; useless as an\nAllomancer; useless to Steris, as I was an embarrassment. Sometimes,\naccomplishment can temper perception. Or so I hope.”\nHe nodded. “I have something for you to do. It will be dangerous.”\nShe dropped the bullet into the box. “To be of use in even a single burst\nof flame and sound is worth more than a lifetime of achieving nothing.”\nHe met her eyes, judging her sincerity.\n“You have a plan?” she asked.\n“There isn’t much time for a plan. This is more of a hunch with\nscaffolding.” He held up the box of bullets, speaking more loudly. “Ranette,\nwhat are these?”\n“Hazekiller rounds.”\n“Hazekiller?” Marasi asked."

She’d unscrewed the grip of the pistol\nand was pulling it apart. “Those are Coinshot rounds. Ceramic tips. When\nthey Push on the bullet as it flies toward them, they’ll yank off the metal\nportion at the back, but the ceramic should keep flying straight and hit them.\nCould be better than aluminum rounds—those, the Allomancer can’t sense\nat all, so he knows to take cover rather than relying on Pushes. These they’ll\nsense and assume they can beat—right up until they’re on the floor\nbleeding.”\nWayne whistled softly.\n“Ruin, Ranette!” Waxillium said. “I’ve never been so glad we’re on the\nsame side.” He hesitated. “Or, at least, that you’re on your own special side\nthat we don’t happen to run afoul of too often.”\n“What are you going to do with them?” Marasi asked.\n“Do?” Ranette asked.\n“Are you going to sell them?” Marasi said. “Patent the idea and license\nthem?”\n“If I did that, then everybody would have them!” Ranette shook her head,\nlooking sick. “Half the people in the city would be here, bothering me.”\n“Lurcher rounds?” Waxillium asked, holding up another box.\n“Similar,” Ranette said, “but with the ceramic on the sides. Not quite as\neffective, at least at long range. Most Lurchers protect themselves by\nPulling bullets to hit an armored plate at their chest. Those bullets, they\nexplode when Pulled on, and you get a little shrapnel blast of ceramics.\nShould work at ten feet or so, though it might not be lethal. I suggest aiming\nfor the head. I’m trying to get the range up.”\n“Tineye rounds?”\n“Make extra noise when fired,” Ranette said. “And another noise when\nthey hit. Fire a few shots around them, and their enhanced senses will have\nthem cowering on the floor, holding their ears. Pretty good if you want to\ntake one alive, though with a Tineye, you’re going to have trouble finding\nthem in the first place.”\n“And Pewterarm rounds,” Waxillium said, studying the final box.\n“Not really much special there,” Ranette said. “Large bullets, extra\npowder, wide hollow tips, soft metal—meant to have a lot of stopping\npower. A Pewterarm can keep going long after being shot a few times, so\nyou want to knock them down and keep them there long enough for their\nbody to realize it should be dying rather than fighting. Of course, the best\nway to drop one is just hit him in the head the first time.”\nA Pewterarm wouldn’t be like Miles, capable of healing immediately.\nThey had great endurance, and could ignore wounds—but those wounds\nwould still kill them, eventually.\n“Huh,” Waxillium said, holding up one of the long bullets. “None of"

You’d need quite the gun to fire them.”\nRanette didn’t respond.\n“This is nice work, Ranette,” Waxillium said. “Even for you. I’m\nimpressed.”\nMarasi expected the gruff woman to brush off the compliment, but\nRanette smiled—though she obviously tried to hide her satisfaction. She\nburied her head in her work, and didn’t even bother to glare Wayne away.\n“So who are the people you said are in danger?”\n“Hostages,” Waxillium said. “Women, including Marasi’s cousin.\nSomeone is going to try to use them to breed new Allomancers.”\n“And Miles is involved in that?”\n“Yes.” Waxillium’s voice was solemn. Worried.\nRanette hesitated, still bent over the disassembled revolver. “Third cubby\nup,” she finally said. “All the way at the back.”\nWaxillium walked over and reached a hand into the depths. He withdrew\na sleek, silvery revolver with a grip that blended onyx and ivory in wavy\nstripes, separated by silver bands. It had a long barrel, the silvery metal so\nhighly polished that it practically glowed in the even electric lights.\n“That’s not a Sterrion,” Ranette said. “It’s better.”\n“Eight chambers,” Waxillium said, raising an eyebrow as he turned the\nrevolver’s cylinder.\n“That’s Invarian steel,” Ranette said. “Stronger, lighter. It let me shave\nthe thickness between chambers, increase the number without making it too\nbig. See the lever on the back, below the hammer?”\nHe nodded.\n“Hold it down and spin the wheel.”\nHe did so. The wheel locked on a certain chamber.\n“It skips that chamber and the one beside it if you fire it normally,”\nRanette said. “You can only fire them if you flip the lever.”\n“Hazekiller rounds,” Waxillium said.\n“Yeah. Load six ordinary shots, two special ones. Fire them when you\nneed them. You burning steel?”\n“I am now.”\n“Metal lines in the grip.”\n“See them.”\n“Push the one on the left.”\nSomething clicked inside the gun. Waxillium whistled softly.\n“What?” Wayne asked.\n“Allomancer-only safety,” Waxillium said. “You have to be a Coinshot or\na Lurcher to turn it off or on.”\n“The switch is embedded inside the grip,” Ranette said. “No exterior sign\nthat it’s there. With that, you’ll never have to worry about someone firing\nyour own gun at you.”\n“Ranette,” Waxillium said, sounding awed. “That’s genius.”\n“I call the gun Vindication,” she said. “After the Ascendant Warrior.”\nThen she hesitated. “You can borrow it. If you bring me a field-test report.”\nWaxillium smiled.\n“This is Nouxil’s work, by the way,” Ranette said, waving to her table.\n“The aluminum gun?” Waxillium asked.\nRanette nodded. “I thought it might be so from the shape of the barrel,"

Disappeared about a year ago. We had a correspondence going.\nNobody’s heard from him.” She held up a piece of metal from inside the\ngun grip. “Anyone here speak High Imperial?”\nWaxillium shook his head.\n“Makes my head hurt,” Wayne said.\n“I can read it, kind of,” Marasi said, taking the square piece of metal.\nThere were several characters scratched into the metal. “Wasing the where\nof needing,” she read, forming the unfamiliar words. The lofty tongue was\nused for old documents dating to the time of the Origin, and occasionally\nfor government ceremony. “It’s a call for help.”\n“Well, we know how Miles got his guns,” Waxillium said, taking the\nplate and looking it over.\n“Wax,” Ranette said. “Miles always had a darkness in him, I know. But\nthis? Are you sure?”\n“Sure as I can be.” He raised Vindication up beside his head. “I saw him\nface-to-face, Ranette. He spouted some rhetoric about saving the city as he\ntried to kill me.”\n“That’ll be useless against him,” Ranette said, nodding to Vindication.\n“I’ve been trying to figure out a gun to use against Bloodmakers. It’s only\nhalf finished.”\n“This will be fine,” Waxillium said, voice even. “I’ll need every edge I\ncan get.” His eyes were hard, like polished steel.\n“I’d heard rumors you’d retired,” Ranette said.\n“I had.”\n“What changed?”\nHe slid Vindication into his shoulder holster. “I have a duty,” he said\nsoftly. “Miles was a lawkeeper. When one of your own goes bad, you put\nhim down personally. You don’t rely on hired help. Wayne, I need shipping\nmanifests. Can you borrow me some from the railway offices?”\n“Sure. I can have them in an hour.”\n“Good. You still have that dynamite?”\n“Sure do. Here in my coat pocket.”\n“You’re insane,” Waxillium said without missing a beat. “But you\nbrought the pressure detonators?”\n“Yup.”\n“Try to avoid blowing anything up by accident,” Waxillium said. “But\nhold on to that dynamite. Marasi, I need you to buy some fishing nets.\nStrong ones.”\nShe nodded.\n“Ranette,” Waxillium began, “I—”\n“I’m not part of your little troop of deputies, Wax,” Ranette said. “Leave\nme out of this.”\n“All I was going to do was ask to borrow a room in your house and some\npaper,” Waxillium said. “I need to sketch this out.”\n“Fine,” she said. “So long as you’re quiet about it. But Wax … you really\nthink you can take Miles? The man is immortal. You’d need a small army to\nstop him.”\n“Good,” Waxillium said. “Because I intend to bring one.”\n15"

You’d need a small army to\nstop him.”\n“Good,” Waxillium said. “Because I intend to bring one.”\n15\n“Wax is slippery,” Miles said, walking alongside Mister Suit through the\ndark tunnel connecting the dorms to the forging hall of the new lair. “He has\nlived so long precisely by learning to avoid being killed by people who are\nstronger and craftier than he is.”\n“You shouldn’t have revealed yourself,” Suit said sternly.\n“I wasn’t about to shoot Wax without him seeing me, Suit,” Miles said.\n“He deserves more respect than that.” The words gnawed at him as he said\nthem. He hadn’t mentioned the first shot he’d taken at Wax, the one while\nthe man’s back had been turned. Nor had he mentioned the cloth of his\nmask, pushed back into his flesh by Wax’s bullet, making it hard to heal his\neye. He’d needed to pull it free.\nSuit snorted. “And it’s said that the Roughs are the place where honor\ngoes to be murdered.”\n“It’s the place honor goes to be strung up, flayed within an inch of its life,\nthen cut down and left in a desert. If it survives something like that, it’ll be\nstronger than hell. Certainly stronger than anything you have at your\nElendel dinner parties.”\n“That from a man who so readily went to kill a friend?” Suit said. The\ntone was still suspicious. He thought Miles had intentionally let Wax\nescape.\nHe didn’t understand at all. This wasn’t about the robberies any longer.\nThe paths chosen by Wax and Miles had crossed. The future could only\ncontinue down one or the other.\nEither Wax would die or Miles would. That would settle the matter.\nRoughs justice. The Roughs weren’t a simple place, but they were a place\nof simple solutions.\n“Wax is not a friend,” Miles said, and truthfully. “We were never friends\n—no more than two rival kings could ever be friends. We respect each\nother, we did similar jobs, and we worked together. It ends there. I’ll stop\nhim, Suit.”\nThey stepped out into the forging room and climbed the stairs up to the\nbalcony that ran along the north side of the large chamber. They walked to\nthe end and stopped beside a doorway, beyond which was the lift. “You are\nquickly becoming a liability, lawkeeper,” Suit said. “The Set does not like\nyou, though—as of yet—I have continued to vouch for your effectiveness.\nDo not make me regret that. Many of my colleagues are convinced that you\nwill turn against us.”\nMiles didn’t know if he would or not. He hadn’t decided. He basically\nonly wanted one thing: vengeance. All of the best motives boiled down to a\nsingle, driving emotion.\nVengeance for fifteen years in the Roughs, achieving nothing. If this city\nburned, maybe—for once—the Roughs would see some justice. And maybe\nMiles could see a government set up here in Elendel that wasn’t corrupt. A\npart of him acknowledged, however, that seeing them—the lords who ruled,\nthe constables who pandered, the senators who spoke so grandly but did\nnothing of use to real people—cast down would be the most satisfying part."

But then, they wanted revolution\ntoo. Perhaps he wouldn’t turn against them. Perhaps.\n“I don’t like being in this place, Suit,” Miles said, nodding to the\nchamber where the Vanishers had set up. “It’s too close to the center of\nthings. My men will be seen coming and going.”\n“We will move you soon,” Suit said. “The Set is in the process of\nacquiring a railway station. You are still committed to the job tonight?”\n“I am. We need more resources.”\n“My colleagues question that,” Suit said. “They wonder why we went to\nso much trouble to outfit your men with aluminum, if it was only to be lost\nin a single fight without so much as killing one of the Allomancers who\nfaced you.”\nIt’s important, Miles thought, because I intended to use that aluminum to\nfinance my own operations. Now he was practically destitute, right back\nwhere he’d begun. Damn you, Wax. Damn you straight to Ironeyes’ Tomb.\n“Do your colleagues question what I’ve done for them?” Miles said,\ndrawing himself up. “Five of the women they wanted are in your\npossession, all without a speck of suspicion attached to you and the Set. If\nyou wish that to continue, my men will be properly outfitted. A single\nRioter could turn the entire bunch against one another.”\nSuit eyed him. The slender old man did not walk with a cane, and his\nback was straight. He was not weak, despite his age and obvious fondness\nfor fine living. The door to the lift opened. Two young men wearing black\nsuits and white shirts walked out of it.\n“The Set has agreed to this job tonight,” Suit said. “After it, you are to go\nto ground for six months and focus on recruitment. We will prepare another\nlist of targets for you to acquire for us. When you return to activity, we will\ndiscuss whether or not the flamboyance of being the ‘Vanishers’ is\nrequired.”\n“The theatrics keep the constables from—”\n“We will discuss it then. Will Wax try to interfere tonight?”\n“I’m counting on it,” Miles said. “If we try to hide, he’ll dig us out\neventually. But it won’t come to that—he’ll figure out where we’re going to\nhit, and he’ll be there trying to stop us.”\n“You are to kill him tonight, then,” Suit said, pointing to the two men.\n“The woman you took yesterday will remain here; use her as bait, if it\ncomes to that. We don’t want to move her while that one has her trail. As\nfor these two, they are to aid you in making certain everything goes\nsmoothly.”\nMiles gritted his teeth. “I don’t need help to—”\n“You will take them,” Suit said coldly. “You’ve proven unreliable with\nregard to Waxillium. It is not open for discussion.”\n“Fine.”\nSuit stepped closer, tapping Miles on the chest and speaking softly. “The\nSet is anxious, Miles. Our monetary resources are very limited at the\nmoment.

You may rob the train, but don’t bother with hostages. We will\ntake half of the aluminum you steal tonight to fund several operations you\nneed not know about. You can have the rest for weapons.”\n“Have your two men there ever fought Allomancers?”\n“They are among our finest,” Suit said. “I think you’ll find them more\nthan capable.”\nThey both knew what this was. Yes, the two would fight Wax, but they\nwould also keep an eye on Miles. Great. More interference.\n“I’m leaving the city,” Suit said. “Wax is getting too close. If you survive\nthe night, send someone to update me.” He said that last part with a hint of\na smile.\nInsufferable bastard, Miles thought as Suit walked over to the lift, where\na quartet of bodyguards waited. He was leaving on his regular train; he’d\nprobably come back on his regular one too. He probably didn’t realize\nMiles had been tracking those.\nSuit departed, leaving Miles with the two black-coated men. Well, he’d\nfind some use for them.\nHe returned to the main chamber, followed by his new babysitters. The\nVanishers—the thirty or so of them that remained—were getting ready for\nthe job tonight. The Machine had been brought into the chamber via the far\nplatform, which moved up to ground level in a large industrial lift, a\nmajestic electrical wonder.\nThe world is changing, Miles thought, leaning down on the railing. First\nrailways, now electricity. How long before men take to the skies, as the\nWords of Founding say is possible? The day might come where every man\nknew the freedom that had once been reserved only to Coinshots.\nChange didn’t scare Miles. Change was an opportunity, a chance to\nbecome something you were not. No Augur was bothered by change.\nAugur. He usually ignored that side of himself. His Feruchemy was what\nkept him alive—and these days he hardly noticed even that, save for the\nfaint sense of extra energy to every step he took. He never got headaches,\nnever felt tired, never had sore muscles, never dealt with colds or pain.\nOn a whim, he took hold of the banister and swung over, dropping to the\nfloor some twenty feet below. For a brief moment, he knew that sense of\nfreedom. Then he hit. One of his legs tried to break—he recognized the\nslight pop. But the bone’s fractures reknit as quickly as they broke, and so it\nnever fully snapped, cracks opening on one side but resealing on the other.\nHe rose from a crouch, whole. The black-coated babysitters dropped\nbeside him, one dropping a bit of metal and slowing a moment before he\nhit. A Coinshot. Well, that would be useful. The other surprised him,\nlanding softly, but not dropping any metal. The ceiling had metal\ncrossbeams. This man would be a Lurcher; he’d Pulled upon those beams to\nslow himself.\nMiles strode through the room, inspecting the Vanishers as they prepared\ntheir gear. Every bit of aluminum they had left had gone for guns and\nbullets. They’d use those from the start this time. At the wedding-dinner"

At the wedding-dinner\nfight, it had taken the men a few moments to switch weapons. Now they\nknew what to anticipate. Their numbers might be fewer, but they’d be much\nbetter prepared.\nHe nodded to Clamps, who was watching over the men. The scarred man\nnodded back. He was loyal enough, though he had joined up for the thrill of\nrobbery rather than the purpose of any cause. Of them all, only Tarson—\ndear, brutal Tarson—had anything resembling true loyalty.\nClamps claimed to be dedicated, though Miles knew otherwise. Well,\nClamps hadn’t been the one to fire the first shot in the last mess. For all\nMiles’s professions about wanting to change things, his temper—and not\nhis mind—had eventually ruled.\nHe should have been better than that. He was a man created to have a\nsteady hand and an even steadier mind. Made by Trell, inspired by the\nSurvivor, yet still weak. Miles questioned himself often. Was that the mark\nof a lack of dedication? He’d never done anything in his life without\nquestioning.\nHe turned, studying his domain, such as it was. Thieves, murderers, and\nbraggarts. He took a deep breath, then burned gold.\nIt was considered one of the least of the Allomantic metals. Far less\nuseful than its alloy, which was in turn far less useful than one of the prime\nbattle metals. In most cases, being a gold Misting was little better than\nbeing an aluminum Misting—a power so useless, it had become proverbial\nfor one who did nothing.\nBut gold was not completely useless. Just mostly so. Upon burning it,\nMiles split. The change was visible only to his own senses, but for a\nmoment, he was two people, two versions of himself. One was the man he\nhad been. The angry lawkeeper, growing more bitter by the day. He wore a\nwhite duster over rugged clothing, with tinted spectacles to shade his eyes\nagainst the harsh sun. Dark hair kept short and greased back. No hat. He’d\nalways hated those.\nThe other man was the man he’d become. Dressed in the clothing of a\ncity worker—buttoned shirt and suspenders over dirty trousers with fraying\ncuffs. He walked with a slouch. When had that begun?\nHe could see through both pairs of eyes, think both sets of thoughts. He\nwas two people at once, and each one loathed the other. The lawkeeper was\nintolerant, angry, and frustrated. He hated anything that broke with the strict\norder of the law, and meted out harsh punishments with no mercy. He had a\nspecial loathing for someone who had once followed the law, but had turned\nhis back upon it.\nThe robber, the Vanisher, hated that the lawkeeper let others choose his\nrules. There was really nothing sacred about the law. It was arbitrary,\ncreated by powerful men to help them hold power. The criminal knew that\nsecretly, deep down, the lawkeeper understood this. He was severe toward\ncriminals because he felt so impotent. Each day, life grew worse for the\ngood people, the people who tried, and the laws did little to help them. He"

He\nwas like a man swatting mosquitoes while ignoring the gash in his leg, an\nartery open and throbbing gushes of blood onto the floor.\nMiles gasped, and extinguished his gold. He felt weary, suddenly, and\nslumped back against the wall. His two minders watched him with\nemotionless expressions.\n“Go,” Miles said to them, waving a weak hand. “Check over my men.\nUse your Allomancy to determine if any of them accidentally left metal on\ntheir bodies. I want them clean.”\nThe two men looked at each other. They didn’t behave as if they cared to\nobey him.\n“Go,” Miles said more firmly. “So long as you’re here, you should be\nuseful.”\nAfter another moment of hesitation, the two men walked away to do as\nordered. Miles slumped down farther, back to the wall, breathing in and out.\nWhy do I do that to myself?\nThere had been considerable speculation about what a gold Misting\nreally saw when burning his metal. A past version of himself, certainly. Was\nit the person he had actually been? Or was it a person he might have\nbecome, if he’d chosen another branching path of his life? That possibility\nhad always struck him as sounding reminiscent of the mythical lost metal,\natium.\nEither way, he liked to think that burning his gold on occasion helped\nhim—that each time he did it, it let him take the best of what he had been\nand mix it with the best of what he could be. An alloy of himself, then.\nIt disturbed him how much the two people he became hated each other.\nHe could almost feel it like an oven’s heat, radiating from coal and stone.\nHe stood back up. Some of the men were staring at him, but he didn’t\ncare. He wasn’t like the criminal bosses he’d often arrested in the Roughs.\nThey had to worry about looking strong in front of their men, lest they be\nkilled by someone who wanted to seize power.\nMiles couldn’t be killed, and his men knew it. He’d once put a shotgun to\nhis own head in front of them to prove it.\nHe walked over to a pile of trunks and boxes. A few were full of things\nMister Suit had ordered stolen from Wax’s mansion, effects the man hoped\nwould help them fight—or perhaps frame—the former lawkeeper. Suit had\nresisted killing Wax at first, for some reason.\nMiles left them and walked around to the back side, where his own\ntrunks had been deposited following the hasty evacuation of their old\nhideout. He picked through a few, then opened one. His white duster was\ninside. He took it out, shaking it, then got out a pair of sturdy Roughs\ntrousers and a matching shirt. He slipped his tinted spectacles into the\npocket, then went to change.\nHe’d been worried about hiding, worried that he’d be recognized and\nbranded an outlaw. Well, an outlaw was what he had become. If this was the\npath he had chosen, he could at least walk it with pride.\nLet them see me for what I am."

It was too late to change one’s aim\nwhen the hammer was already falling. But it wasn’t too late to straighten his\nback.\n* * *\nWaxillium stared at the wall of Ranette’s sitting room. One side was piled\nwith furniture, where she’d put things out of the way to make a handier\npathway between her workshop and her bedroom. The other half of the\nroom was strewn with boxes of various kinds of ammunition, bits of scrap\nmetal, and cast barrels for gun making. There was dust everywhere. Very\nlike her. He’d asked her for a way to prop up his paper pad, expecting her to\nfind him an easel. She’d absently handed him some nails and pointed\ntoward a hammer. So he’d just hung it on the wall, wincing as he drove the\nnails into the fine wood.\nHe stepped up, using a pencil to scribble a note to himself in the corner.\nThe pile of shipping manifests that Wayne had brought lay to the side.\nApparently, Wayne had left a gun he’d borrowed from Ranette in place of\nthe manifests, considering it a fair trade. It had probably never occurred to\nhim that a group of train engineers would be completely baffled to find their\nmanifests gone and a pistol in their place.\nMiles will strike at Carlo’s Bend, Wax thought, tapping the paper.\nIt had been easy to locate a shipment of aluminum. House Tekiel, tired of\nbeing robbed, was indeed making a large fuss over their new vault-style\nrailway car. Wax could understand the reasoning; the Tekiels were best\nknown as bankers, and their business relied on security and asset protection.\nThe robberies been become a major embarrassment to them. They were\nintending to recover in a visible way.\nIt was almost like a dare to Miles and his Vanishers. Wax made another\nnotation on his paper. The Tekiel shipment would follow a very direct route\ntoward Doxonar. He’d mapped it, noting locations where the railway tracks\nwound close to one of the canals.\nI won’t be able to watch where we’re going, Wax thought, making\nanother notation. I need to know exactly how far from the previous stop\nCarlo’s Bend is.…\nThere wasn’t much time to prepare. He fingered the earring in his left\nhand, running his thumb along its smooth side as he thought.\nThe door opened. Wax didn’t look up, but the sound of the footsteps was\nenough to tell him it was Marasi. Soft shoes. Ranette and Wayne both wore\nboots.\nMarasi cleared her throat.\n“Nets?” Wax asked, distractedly writing the number 35.17 on the paper.\n“I found some, finally,” she said, walking up beside him, looking over the\nnotations. “You can make sense of this?”\n“For the most part. Except Wayne’s doodles.”\n“They … appear to be pictures of you. Unflatteringly ugly ones.”\n“That’s the part that doesn’t make sense,” Waxillium said. “Everyone\nknows I’m irreparably handsome.” He smiled to himself. That was one of"

She’d always claimed he’d look\nbetter with a nice scar on his face, after good Roughs fashion.\nMarasi smiled too, though her eyes were on his notations and scribbling.\n“The phantom railcar?” she asked, pointing to his drawing of a ghostly train\ncoming down the tracks, alongside a diagram of how it had probably been\nmade.\n“Yes,” he said. “Most of the attacks happened on misty nights, apparently\nto make it much easier to hide the fact that the phantom ‘train’ is really just\na false front with a large headlamp, attached to a moving rail platform.”\n“You’re certain?”\n“Reasonably,” Waxillium said. “They’re using the canals to attack, and so\nthey need some sort of diversion to keep eyes off what is sneaking up\nbehind.”\nShe pursed her lips, thoughtful.\n“Was Wayne out there?” Waxillium asked.\n“Yes, he’s bothering Ranette. I … honestly left the room because I\nworried she’d shoot him.”\nWaxillium smiled.\n“I picked up a broadsheet when I was out,” she said. “The constables\nhave found the old hideout.”\n“Already?” Waxillium said. “Wayne said we had until dark.”\n“It’s dark already.”\n“It is? Hell.” Waxillium checked his watch. They had less time than he’d\nthought. “It still shouldn’t be in the papers yet. The police found the hideout\nearly.”\nMarasi nodded toward his sketches. “This indicates that you know where\nthe Vanishers will strike. I don’t want to pound a brittle metal, Lord\nWaxillium, but we really should tell the constables that fact.”\n“I think I know where the attack will happen. If we let the constables\nknow, they’ll flood the area and scare off Miles.”\n“Wax,” she said, stepping closer. “I understand that independent spirit;\nit’s part of what makes you what you are. But we’re not in the Roughs. You\ndon’t have to do this all by yourself.”\n“I don’t intend to. I’ll involve the constables, I promise. Miles, however,\nis not an ordinary criminal. He knows what the constables will try, and he\nwill watch for them. This has to be done at the right time, in the right way.”\nWaxillium tapped his notations on the wall. “I know Miles. I know how he\nthinks. He’s like me.”\nAlmost too much so.\n“That means he can anticipate you too.”\n“He undoubtedly will. I’ll anticipate him better.”\nThe moment Waxillium had drawn his gun and fired back against the\nVanishers, he’d started down this path. Once he got his teeth into\nsomething, he didn’t let go.\n“You are right about me,” he said.\n“Right? I don’t believe I said anything about you, Lord Waxillium.”\n“You’re thinking it,” he said. “That I’m arrogant for wanting to do this\nmy way, for not handing this over to the constables.

I realize that you are studying to\nbe an attorney and a judge, and that your training mandates you should go\nto the authorities.

He reached up,\nsquaring off a box of notes. “This is your part.”\n“I won’t be in the train car with you?” She sounded worried.\n“No,” Waxillium said. “You and Wayne will watch from the hilltop.”\n“You’ll be alone.”\n“I will.”\nShe fell silent. “You knew what I was thinking of you. What are you\nthinking of me, Lord Waxillium?”\nHe smiled. “If the game is to work the same way, I can’t tell you my\nthoughts. You need to guess them.”\n“You are thinking about how young I am,” she said. “And you’re worried\nabout having me involved, lest I be hurt.”\n“Hardly a difficult guess. So far, I’ve given you what … three\nopportunities to abandon this course and seek safety?”\n“You’re also thinking,” she said, “that you’re glad I insist on staying,\nbecause I will be useful. Life has taught you to use the resources you have.”\n“Better,” he said.\n“You think I’m clever, as you have stated. But you also worry that I get\nflustered too easily, and worry it will be used against you.”\n“Do those records you’ve read talk about Paclo the Dusty?”\n“Sure. He was one of your deputies before you met Wayne.”\n“He was a good friend,” Waxillium said. “And a solid lawman. But I’ve\nnever met a man who was as easy to startle as Paclo. A softly closed door\ncould make him yelp.”\nShe frowned.\n“I assume the records didn’t talk about that,” Waxillium said.\n“They depict him as very brave.”\n“He was brave, Lady Marasi. You see, many people mistake startlement\nfor cowardice. Yes, a gunshot would make Paclo jump. Then he’d run to see\nwhat had caused it. I once saw him stare down six men with guns trained on"

I once saw him stare down six men with guns trained on\nhim, and he didn’t break a sweat.”\nHe turned to her. “You are inexperienced. So was I, once. So is every\nman. The measure of a person is not how much they have lived. It is not\nhow easily they jump at a noise or how quick they are to show emotion. It’s\nin how they make use of what life has shown them.”\nHer blush deepened. “I’m also thinking that you like to lecture.”\n“It comes with the lawman’s badge.”\n“You don’t … wear that anymore.”\n“A man can take it off, Lady Marasi. But he can never stop wearing it.”\nHe met her gaze. She looked up with eyes that were deep, reflective, like\nthe water of an unexpected spring in the Roughs. He steeled himself. He\nwould be bad for her. Very bad. He’d thought the same of Lessie, and he\nhad been right.\n“There’s another thing I’m thinking about you,” she said softly. “Can you\nguess it?”\nAll too well.\nWith reluctance, he broke her gaze and looked at the pad. “Yes. You are\nthinking that I should talk Ranette into lending you a rifle. I agree. While I\ndo think that it would be wise of you to train with a revolver eventually, I’d\nrather you spend this particular encounter with a weapon you use well.\nMaybe we can find a rifle that will fit those aluminum rounds Wayne\ngrabbed.”\n“Oh. Of course.”\nWaxillium pretended not to notice her embarrassment.\n“I think,” Marasi said, “that I’ll go check on Wayne and Ranette.”\n“Good idea. Hopefully she hasn’t discovered that he took one of her guns\nto trade.”\nMarasi withdrew, walking to the door in haste.\n“Lady Marasi?” Waxillium called.\nShe hesitated at the door, turning, hopeful.\n“You did a good job of reading me,” he said, nodding in respect. “Not\nmany can do that. I’m not known to be free with my emotions.”\n“Advanced interrogation techniques class,” she said. “And … uh, I’ve\nread your psychological profile.”\n“I have a psychological profile?”\n“Yes, I’m afraid. Doctor Murnbru wrote it after his visit to Weathering.”\n“That little rat Murnbru was a psychologist?” Waxillium said, genuinely\nbaffled. “I was sure he was a gambling cheat, passing through town looking\nfor marks to swindle.”\n“Er, yes. That’s in the profile. You, uh, have a tendency to think anyone\nwho wears too much red is a chronic gambler.”\n“I do?”\nShe nodded.\n“Damn,” he said. I’m going to need to read that thing.\nShe left and pulled the door closed. He turned back to his plan once\nagain. He raised his hand and slipped his earring into his ear. He was\nsupposed to wear it when praying, or when doing something of great\nimport.\nHe figured that tonight, he’d be doing a lot of both.\n16\nWayne hobbled through the railway station, supporting himself on his\nbrown cane, walking with a slow, intentionally frail step.

        "text": "He figured that tonight, he’d be doing a lot of both.\n16\nWayne hobbled through the railway station, supporting himself on his\nbrown cane, walking with a slow, intentionally frail step. There was quite a\ncrowd pushing and shoving one another and gawking at the train up ahead.\nA group of them surged to the side, nearly toppling him.\nEveryone was standing up so tall. That gave Wayne—back bent with age\n—no hope of seeing what the fuss was about. “No thought for a poor\nelderly woman,” Wayne grumbled. A gravelly tone, nasal and higher-\npitched than his normal voice, mixed with a nice Margothian District\naccent. The district no longer existed, at least not in the same way; it had\nbeen consumed by the industrial quarter of its octant, its residents moving\naway. A dying accent for a dying woman. “No respect at all. A travesty, I\ntell you. Plain and simple, that’s what it is.”\nA few youths in the crowd in front glanced back at him, taking in his\nancient coat—it went down to his ankles—his face furrowed with age, his\nsilvery hair beneath a felt cap. “Sorry, ma’am,” one of them finally said,\nmaking way for him.\nNow, there’s a nice boy, Wayne thought, patting his arm and hobbling\nforward. One by one, people made way for him. Sometimes it took a little\nfit of coughing that sounded like it might be contagious. Wayne was careful\nnot to look like a beggar. That would draw the attention of constables, who\nmight think he was looking for marks to pickpocket.\nNo, he wasn’t a beggar. He was Abrigain, an old woman who had come\nto see what the fuss was about. Abrigain wasn’t rich, nor was she poor.\nFrugal, with a meticulously patched coat, a favored hat that had once been\nfashionable. Spectacles thick as a dockworker’s wits. A few very young\nboys let her by, and Abrigain gave them each a piece of candy, patting them\non their heads. Nice boys. They reminded Abrigain of her grandchildren.\nWayne eventually reached the front. There, the Breaknaught sat in all its\nglory. It was a train car built like a fortress, with thick steel armor, shiny\nrounded corners, and a massive door on the side. That door looked like the\none to an enormous vault, with a rotating wheel lock on the outside.\nThe door was open, and the chamber inside was mostly empty. A large\nsteel cargo box had been welded to the floor at the center of the railcar. In\nfact, he could see through the door in the railcar that the cargo box itself\nlooked as if it had been welded shut on all sides.\n“Oh, my!” Wayne said. “That is impressive.”\nA guard stood nearby, wearing the insignia of an officer in the private\nsecurity force of House Tekiel. He smiled, puffing out his chest with pride.\n“It marks the dawn of a new era,” he said. “The end of banditry and railway\nrobberies.”\n“Oh, it’s impressive, young man,” Wayne said. “But surely you\nexaggerate. I’ve seen railcars before—I even rode on one, curse that day."

I’ve seen railcars before—I even rode on one, curse that day.\nMy grandson Charetel wanted me to come with him and meet his bride over\nin Covingtar, and it was the only way, though I thought riding in a horse\ncart had always worked well enough for me before. Progress, he’d called it.\nProgress is getting locked up in a box, I suppose, unable to see the sun\noverhead or enjoy the trip. Anyway, that train car was like this one. Only\nnot so shiny.”\n“I assure you,” the guard said, “this is quite impregnable. It will change\neverything. You see that door?”\n“It locks,” Wayne said. “I can see that. But safes can be cracked, young\nman.”\n“Not this one,” he said. “Bandits won’t be able to open it because it can’t\nbe opened—not by them, and not by us. Once that door is closed, it engages\na mechanism tied to a ticking clock inside the doors. Those doors cannot be\nopened again for twelve hours, regardless of whether or not one knows the\ndoor code.”\n“Explosives,” Wayne said. “Bandits are always blowing things up.\nEveryone knows that.”\n“That steel is six inches thick,” the guard said. “The amount of dynamite\nit would take to blow it open would likely destroy the contents of the car.”\n“But surely an Allomancer could get in,” Wayne said.\n“How? They could Push on the metal all they wanted; it’s so heavy, it\nwould toss them backward. And even if they somehow did get in, we will\nhave eight guards riding inside the railcar.”\n“My,” Wayne said, letting his accent slip. “That’s impressive indeed.\nWhat will the guards be armed with?”\n“A full quartet of…” the man began, but then trailed off, looking more\nclosely at Wayne. “Of…” His eyes narrowed in suspicion.\n“Oh, I’m missing my tea!” Wayne exclaimed, then turned and began\nhobbling back through the crowd.\n“Stop that woman!” the guard said.\nWayne stopped pretending and stood up straight, shoving his way\nthrough the crowd with more fervor. He glanced over his shoulder. The\nguardsman was forcing his way forward in pursuit. “Stop!” the guardsman\nyelled. “Stop, damn you!”\nWayne raised his cane and pulled the trigger. His hand started wobbling\nas it always did when he tried to use a gun, but this one only had blanks in\nit, so it was all right. The pistol-like crack drove the crowd into a panic,\npeople ducking down in a wave like wind blowing through a field of grain.\nWayne darted through the prostrate figures, hopping over some of them,\nreaching the back of the crowd. The guard raised his gun; Wayne dashed\naround a corner of the station building. Then he stopped time.\nHe threw off his coat, then pulled off the blouse underneath, revealing a\ngentleman’s suit: black coat, white shirt, red cravat. Wax had called it\n“purposefully unimaginative,” whatever that meant. He removed the items\nthat, tied to the inside of the blouse, had formed the elderly woman’s bust: a"

He removed the items\nthat, tied to the inside of the blouse, had formed the elderly woman’s bust: a\nsmall bag, a collapsible gentleman’s hat, and a wet rag. He unfolded the hat\nand stuffed the blouse into the extra space inside it before pulling off his\nwig and putting the hat on his head.\nHe ripped the outer layer off his cane, turning it black instead. He tossed\nthe wig aside, then dropped the bag by the wall. Finally, he wiped his face\nclean of makeup with the rag, discarded it, then collapsed his speed bubble.\nHe stumbled out around the corner of the building, acting as if he’d been\nshoved. He cursed, straightening his hat and raising his black cane, shaking\nit in anger.\nThe guard puffed up beside him. “Are you all right, m’lord?”\n“No!” Wayne snapped, filling his voice with every ounce of aristocratic\ncondescension he could manage. Madion Ways accent, the richest area of\nthe First Octant—where House Tekiel owned much of the land. “What kind\nof ruffian was that, Captain! The launch was supposed to be handled with\npoise and care!”\nThe guard froze, and Wayne could see his mind working. He’d been\nexpecting a random nobleman, but this person sounded like a member of\nHouse Tekiel—the guard’s employers.\n“Sorry, m’lord!” the guard said. “But I chased ’im off.”\n“Who was he?” Wayne said, walking over to the wig. “He threw this\naside as he passed me.”\n“Was dressed up like an elderly woman,” the guard said, scratching his\nhead. “Asking me questions about the Breaknaught.”\n“Damn it all, man. That must have been one of the Vanishers!”\nThe guard paled.\n“Do you know how embarrassed our house will be if something happens\non this trip?” Wayne said, stepping in, shaking the cane. “Our reputation is\non the line. Our heads are on the line, Captain. How many guards do you\nhave?”\n“Three dozen, m’lord, and—”\n“Not enough! Not enough at all! Send for more.”\n“I—”\n“No!” Wayne said. “I’ll do it. I have several of my own guards here. I’ll\nsend one to fetch another division. Your men are watching the area for more\ncreatures such as that one?”\n“Well, I haven’t told them yet, m’lord. Thought I’d try to get ’im myself,\nyou see, and—”\n“You left your post?” Wayne screamed, raising hands to the side of his\nhead, cane dangling from his fingers. “You let him lure you away? Idiot!\nGet back, man! Go! Alert the others. Oh, Survivor above. If this goes\nwrong, we’re dead. Dead!”\nThe guard captain scrambled back and ran for the train, where people\nwere moving away in a panic. Wayne leaned back against the wall, checked\nhis pocket watch, then waited for a good moment when he had enough\nspace to put a speed bubble. He was reasonably sure nobody was looking.\nOff came the hat. He dropped the cane and reversed his jacket, turning it\ninto a brown and yellow military coat, matching that of the guards.

He\npulled off his fake nose and took a triangular cloth cap out of the bag he’d\ndropped by the wall.\nHe put this on his head instead of the gentleman’s hat. Always have the\nright hat. That was key. He strapped a handgun on over the coat after\ndropping his pants, revealing the soldier’s uniform beneath. Then he\ncollapsed his bubble and jogged around the corner, making his way up to\nthe tracks. He found the captain organizing his men, yelling orders. There\nwere some angry noblemen arguing with one another nearby.\nThe cargo wasn’t being unloaded. That was good. Wayne had figured\nthey’d just give up on this run, with all the fuss, but Wax had disagreed. He\nsaid that the Tekiels had made such a big deal of the Breaknaught that a\nhiccup or two wouldn’t stop them.\nFools, Wayne thought, shaking his head. Farnsward didn’t agree with the\ndecision. He’d been in House Tekiel’s private guard for ten years now,\nthough he’d mostly served on the Outer Estates with his lord, who was\nchronically ill. Farnsward had seen a lot in his time, and he’d learned that\nthere were reasons to take risks. To save a life, to win a battle, to protect the\nhouse’s name. But to take a risk just because you’d said you would?\nFoolishness.\nHe jogged up to the captain he’d talked to earlier and saluted. “Sir,” he\nsaid. “I’m Farnsward Dubs—Lord Evenstrom Tekiel said I should report to\nyou.” An Outer Estates accent with a hint of aristocracy, picked up from so\nlong associating with them.\nThe man was looking frazzled. “Very well. I guess we can use every\nman.”\n“Sorry, sir,” Wayne said, leaning in. “Lord Evenstrom is excitable,\nsometimes. I know how it goes; this isn’t the first time he’s sent me to help\nsomeone who didn’t need it. Bren and I will stay out of your way.”\n“Bren?”\n“Oh, he was right behind me,” Wayne said, turning around, looking\nconfused.\nWax ducked out of the station, wearing a uniform similar to Wayne’s. He\nalso had a fake paunch of some size, hiding some specific materials he’d\nneed for the night.\n“There he is,” Wayne said. “He’s a dull-minded lout, sir. His father left\nhim the position, but you could hit his steel against flint all night and not get\na spark, if you know what I mean.”\n“Well, stay here,” the captain said. “Guard this post. Don’t let anyone\napproach the train car, no matter what they look like.” He left, running over\nto the batch of noblemen.\n“’Ello, Wax,” Wayne said, tipping his hat to the other man. “Ready to get\nswallowed?”\nWaxillium glanced back toward the station building. Civilians were still\nscattering. The ground was littered with hats and handkerchiefs. “You need\nto make sure they still send the train, Wayne. No matter what, it must go\nforward.”\n“I thought you said they’ll be too embarrassed not to launch it.”"

Not so sure about this next part. Make it happen,\nWayne.”\n“Sure thing, mate.” Wayne checked his watch. “She’s late—”\nA sudden series of cracks split the air. Gunshots. Even though Wayne was\nexpecting them, they still made him jump. The guards around them cried\nout, shouting, looking for the source of the shots. Waxillium fell, screaming,\nblood spraying from his shoulder. Wayne caught him as another guard\nspotted flashes coming from atop the building.\nThe guards opened fire as Wayne dragged Waxillium out of harm’s way.\nHe looked about, then—acting frantic—shoved Waxillium into the open\ndoor of the railcar. Several of the guards looked at him, but nobody said a\nword. Waxillium’s eyes were staring dead into the air. The other guards had\nprobably lost mates to bandits or house skirmishes, and they knew. In the\nheat of the fighting, you got the wounded to safety, and it didn’t bloody\nmatter where.\nThe firing stopped from atop the building, but it started up again from a\nrooftop nearby. A few bullets sprayed sparks from the top of a nearby\ngirder. A little close there, Marasi, Wayne thought with annoyance. Why did\nevery woman he met try to shoot him? Just because he could heal from it.\nThat was like drinking a man’s beer just because he could order more.\nWayne plastered a worried look on his face. “They’re comin’ for the\ncargo!” he yelled. Then he grabbed the door to the large cargo car, kicked\nthe counterbalance lever to the side, and ran forward. He slammed the door\non the Breaknaught shut—Wax inside the railcar, Wayne himself standing\noutside—before anyone thought to stop him.\nThe gunfire stopped. Nearby, the guards cowering behind cover looked at\nWayne with horrified expressions. The door to the train clicked into place,\nsettling in.\n“Rust and Ruin, man!” one of the nearby soldiers said. “What have you\ndone?”\n“Locked up the cargo!” Wayne said. “Look, it made them stop.”\n“There were supposed to be soldiers inside there!” the captain said,\nrunning up to him.\n“They were trying to get in before we got it locked,” Wayne said. “You\nsaw what they were doing.” He looked at the door. “They can’t get to the\ncargo now. We’ve won!”\nThe captain looked concerned. He glanced at the noblemen who were\npicking themselves off the ground. Wayne held his breath as they came\nstorming over to the captain. The captain, however, repeated Wayne’s same\nwords.\n“But we stopped them,” the captain explained, knowing that he—and not\nWayne—would bear the blame if it was decided that mistakes had been\nmade. “They dropped their attack. We won!”\nWayne stepped back, relaxing against a pillar as guards were sent to try\nto find out who had been shooting. They came back with a large number of\nrifle bullet casings planted on the ground in various locations, though most\nof the “shots” had been blanks. Several beggar boys had been paid to fire"

Several beggar boys had been paid to fire\nblanks into the air, then plant stories of men getting into horse carriages and\nriding away in a hurry.\nIn under an hour, the train was on its way—with everyone at House\nTekiel convinced they’d fought off a major Vanishers robbery. There was\neven talk of giving Wayne a commendation, though he deflected the glory\nto the captain and slipped away before anyone could begin asking just\nwhich lord retained him as a bodyguard.\n17\nWaxillium rode alone in the cold cargo railcar, shoulder wet with fake\nblood, listening to the wheels thump over the tracks beneath him. A\nswinging lamp hung where he’d placed it on a hook in the ceiling, near a\ncorner. He’d also secured the webbing of nets on the ceiling, tucked up and\nheld in place by special hooks affixed with industrial tape. It felt good to\nhave all of that removed from wrapping around his legs, thighs, and fake\npaunch. His guard’s uniform, now much too large for him, lay in a heap in\nthe corner, and he wore a utilitarian pair of suit pants and a light black\njacket instead.\nHe sat on the floor, back to the side of the cargo container, legs stretched\nout. He held Vindication in his hand, absently spinning the cylinder and\nhitting the switch to lock it on to the special chambers. He had two of each\ntype of hazekiller round in his pocket, and had loaded a Coinshot round and\na Pewterarm round into the special chambers.\nHe still had his earring in.\nYou wanted me to do this, he thought toward Harmony. Did an accusation\ncount as a prayer? Well, here I am. I’ll expect a little help, if that’s\nacceptable to your immortal plan, and all that.\nThe cargo box was beside him. He could see why House Tekiel was so\nproud of the job they’d done; the welded strongbox would be ridiculously\ndifficult for thieves to steal. Getting it out of the car would require hours\nspent cutting it free with a gas torch or a large electric saw. That, plus the\nclever door and the supposed existence of guards, would make for a\ndaunting—perhaps impossible—robbery.\nYes, the Tekiels had been clever. Problem was, they were thinking about\nthis all wrong.\nWaxillium pulled a package from beneath his coat. The dynamite and\ndetonator that Wayne had found. He set the package beside him on the floor,\nthen eyed his pocket watch. Right about now …\nThe train suddenly started to slow.\n* * *\n“Yup,” Wayne said, looking through the spyglass as he crouched against the\nhillside. “He’s right. Wanna see?”\nMarasi took the spyglass nervously. The two of them were in position\nfollowing a hasty gallop out of the city. She felt naked, wearing a pair of\nRanette’s trousers. Completely improper. Every man they passed would\nstare at her legs.\nMaybe that will stop the Vanishers from shooting, she thought with a\ngrimace. They’ll be too distracted.

It\nwas nearly midnight when the train had finally come chugging along.\nNow it was slowing, and the brakes caused screeches and sparks in the\nnight. Ahead of the train, a ghostly apparition was approaching in the\nopposite direction, a bright light shining in front of it. She shivered. The\nphantom railcar.\n“Wax’ll be happy,” Wayne said.\n“What?” she asked. “About the phantom?”\n“No. There’s mist tonight.”\nShe started, realizing that it was forming in the air. The mist wasn’t like a\nnormal fog; it didn’t come rolling in over the ocean. It grew in the air,\nsprouting like frost on a cold piece of metal. She shivered as it began to\nenvelop them, giving the headlamps below a ghostly cast.\nShe focused the spyglass on the approaching train. Because she’d been\nwarned what to look for, and because of her angle, she could easily see the\ntruth. It was a decoy. A hand-propelled rail wagon behind a wooden engine\nfacade.\n“How do they make the light work?” she said.\n“I dunno. Magic?”\nShe snorted, trying to get a good look at what was behind the framework.\n“Must be some kind of chemical battery. I’ve read of the work … but Rust\nand Ruin, that’s a powerful light. I doubt they can run it for long.”\nAs the real train pulled to a halt, some men sprang from its sides. House\nTekiel had sent guards. That gave Marasi a smile. Maybe the robbery\nwouldn’t happen after all.\nThe front portion of the phantom train dropped.\n“Aw, hell,” Wayne said.\n“What is—”\nShe was cut off by a loud series of shots, incredibly fast. She jumped\nback by reflex, ducking down, though nothing was aimed at them. Wayne\ngrabbed the spyglass, raising it.\nMarasi couldn’t make out what happened next through the darkness and\nthe mists. And she was glad. The shots continued, and she heard men\nscreaming.\n“Rotary gun,” Wayne said softly. “Damn, these people are serious.”\n“I have to help,” Marasi said, unslinging the rifle Ranette had given her.\nIt was of an unfamiliar make, but the woman swore it would be more\naccurate than anything Marasi had ever used. She raised the rifle. If she\ncould hit the Vanishers …\nWayne took the barrel of her rifle in one hand, gently pushing it down.\nThe rotary gun stopped firing, and the night grew silent.\n“There’s nothing you can do, mate, and we don’t want to draw the\nattention of that damn rotary. Besides, you really think you can hit one of\nthem from all the way up here?”\n“I’ve hit red at five hundred paces.”\n“At night?” Wayne said. “In the mists?”\nMarasi fell silent. Then she held out her hand and gestured impatiently\nfor the spyglass. Wayne gave it to her, and she watched six men hop from\nthe phantom train. They walked along the sides of the real train, guns at the\nready and watching.\n“Distraction?” Wayne asked, watching."

He said to…” She trailed off.\nHe said to watch the canal.\nShe turned, scanning the canal with the spyglass. Something big and dark\nwas floating down it. Shrouded in mists, it looked like some kind of\nmassive beast—a leviathan swimming quietly through the water. It came up\nto the middle of the train, then halted. A dark, shadowy leg lifted from the\nblack mass. By the Survivor, she thought, shivering. It’s alive.\nBut no … the leg was too stiff. It moved up, rotated out, then came down.\nAs the thing in the canal stopped, the leg clamped into place on the shore.\nFor stabilization, Marasi realized. That’s what made the depression in the\nground we saw earlier.\nOnce the thing … the machine … was stabilized, some men moved\nthrough the darkness to the vault car. They worked for a few moments.\nThen a large arm rose out of the dark mass on the canal. It swung over\ntoward the tracks, then reached down, grabbed the entire vault car, and\nlifted it.\nMarasi gaped. The car was lifted only a few feet, but that was enough.\nThe machine was a crane.\nThe Vanishers who had unhooked the couplers helped push the train car\nover across the narrow strip of land toward the canal. The black mass had to\nbe a barge. Marasi ran some quick numbers in her head. In order to lift the\ntrain car like that, the barge must be very heavy and have considerable\nballast on the other side.\nShe lifted her spyglass and was pleased to be able to pick out another\ncrane arm extending in the other direction, holding some kind of heavy\nweight. The barge sank somewhat into the waters as the vault car was lifted,\nbut not as far as Marasi would have assumed. It probably was designed with\nsome means of bottoming out in the canal, perhaps an extendable section\nunderneath the barge. That, plus the stabilizing arm, might be enough.\n“My, my, my…” Wayne whispered. “Ain’t that somethin’.”\nThe machine dropped the entire vault car onto its barge, and then lifted\nsomething else off. Something large and rectangular. She had already\nguessed what to expect. A replica.\nMarasi watched as the duplicate railcar was lowered onto the tracks. The\ncouplings made it very tricky. This could ruin their entire plan; lower the car\nin the wrong way, ruin a coupler, and when the train pulled away it would\nleave its back half on the tracks. That would make it more obvious what had\nhappened. The Vanishers on the ground guided the process.\nSeveral of the other Vanishers were firing shots through the windows of a\npassenger car a few places ahead, probably to keep anyone from peeking\nout. However, the way the tracks bent around a tree-topped hill here, it\nwould be very difficult for anyone inside to get a good view of what was\nhappening.

I’ll have you know that I pride myself on my\ncheery, optimistic attitude.”\nShe stopped, looking back at him, raising an eyebrow. “You pride\nyourself on it?”\nHe raised a hand to his chest, adopting a tone that sounded almost\npriestly. “Yes, but pride is bad, you know. I’ve been trying to be more\nhumble lately. Hurry up, hurry up. We’re gonna lose them. You want Wax to\nbe cornered and alone? Gosh, woman.”\nShe shook her head, turning and continuing down the hillside to where\ntheir horses were tied.\n* * *\nMiles stood with hands clasped behind his back, riding on the front of the\nMachine as it slid quietly down the canal. The part crane, part barge wasn’t\nexactly what he’d envisioned when he’d explained his plot to Mister Suit,\nbut it was close.\nHe was proud of what he’d done: not just become a thief, but become one\nthat captured people’s imaginations. Suit could say what he wanted about\nthe theatrics, but they worked. The constables had no idea how he was\nperforming the thefts.\n“They checked on all six of the Tekiel guards, boss,” Tarson said,\nstepping up to him. His arm was out of its sling. Pewter savants could heal\nquickly. Not as quickly as someone like Miles, but it was still remarkable.\nOf course, pewter savants were also likely to run themselves to death, never\nnoticing that their body was exhausted. It was a dangerous art that burned\nmen up as quickly as Allomancers burned metal.\n“Engineers too,” Tarson continued. “They caught a few more guards in\nthe last passenger car, trying to sneak out to see how we were getting the\ncargo. We shot them. I think that means we’re clean.”\n“Not yet,” Miles said softly, staring forward into the darkness as they\nsailed through the mists, moving by way of a pair of slow-turning propellers\nunderneath the barge. “Waxillium knows how we’re doing this.”\nTarson hesitated. “Uh … you sure?”\n“Yes,” Miles said absently. “He’s inside the train car.”"

Miles could hear members of his team covering it with a tarp, to\nobscure it as they approached the City. They’d look like an ordinary barge,\nthe arms and ballast hidden under other tarps and the whole thing disguised\nto look like a shipment of stone from one of the outer quarries. Miles even\nhad a shipping manifest and docking authorization, along with a few tarps\nthat actually hid piles of neatly cut stone.\n“I don’t know the method he used,” Miles said. “But he’ll be in there.\nWax thinks like a lawkeeper. This is the best way to find our hideout—stay\nwith the cargo you know will be stolen, even if you’re not sure precisely\nhow.” He paused. “No. He’ll have guessed how we’re doing it. That’s the\nrisk of being as good as he is. As good as I was. You start to think like a\ncriminal.”\nBetter than a criminal, really.\nIn a way, it was surprising that more lawkeepers didn’t end up turning to\ncrime. If you saw something done wrong frequently enough, you’d—by\nnature—want to see it finally done right. Miles had started planning these\nrobberies in the back of his mind ten years ago, when he’d realized that\nrailway security was focused on the railcars. At first it had been just a\nthought experiment. That was another thing to be proud of. He had robbed,\nand he’d done it well. Very well. And the people … he’d gone through the\ncity, listening. They spoke with awe of the Vanishers.\nThey’d never treated him like that back in the Roughs. They’d hated him\nwhile he’d protected him. Now they loved him while he stole from him.\nPeople were baffling, but it felt good not to be hated. Feared, yes. But not\nhated.\n“So what are we going to do?” Tarson asked.\n“Nothing,” Miles said. “Wax likely doesn’t realize I’ve guessed he’s\nthere. That gives us an advantage.”\n“But…”\n“We can’t open the railcar here,” Miles said. “That’s the entire point of\nthe thing. We’ll need the workshop.” He paused. “Though I suppose we\ncould just dump the entire car into the canal. It’s deep enough here to sink\nentirely. I wonder if Wax has a plan to open the door if something like that\nhappens.”\n“I don’t think Mister Suit would much like us sinking the train car, boss,”\nTarson said. “Not after what he must have spent to make that replica.”\n“Yes. Unfortunately, the canal is only about fourteen feet deep. If we\ndumped the car, we’d never get it back out before another ship’s hull\ncollided with it, revealing what we’ve done. Pity.”\nWaxillium’s death would almost be worth the loss of the cargo. Mister\nSuit didn’t realize how dangerous the man was. Oh, he acted like he did.\nBut if he had really appreciated how dangerous, how effective, Waxillium"

Oh, he acted like he did.\nBut if he had really appreciated how dangerous, how effective, Waxillium\nwas … well, he’d never have allowed this robbery. He’d have stopped all\noperations and pulled out of the city. And Miles would have agreed with the\nmove, save for one thing.\nThat would have meant no confrontation.\nThey floated into the City, carrying the train car, its cargo, and its\noccupant—almost as if Wax were a lord in his grand carriage. His was a\nnearly impregnable fortress that protected him from the dozen or so men on\nthe barge who would happily have killed him.\nMister Suit’s two minders—who called themselves Push and Pull—\njoined Miles at the front of the barge, but he didn’t speak to them. Together,\nthey drifted through Elendel. Streetlights were lines of fire in the mists,\nbright white, running along the canal. Other lights sparkled high in the sky,\nthe windows of buildings that were shrouded in the mist.\nNearby, some of his men were muttering. The mists were considered bad\nluck by most, though at least two of the major religions accepted them as\nmanifestations of the divine. Miles had never been certain how to think of\nthem. They made Allomancy stronger, or so some claimed, but his abilities\nwere already as strong as they could be.\nThe Church of the Survivor taught that the mists belonged to him,\nKelsier, Lord of Mists. He appeared on nights when the mist was thick and\ngave his blessing to the independent. Whether they be thieves, scholars,\nanarchists, or a farmer who lived on his own land. Anyone who survived on\nhis own—or who thought for himself—was someone who followed the\nSurvivor, whether he knew it or not.\nThat’s another thing the current establishment makes a mockery of, Miles\nthought. Many of them claimed to belong to the Church of the Survivor, but\ndiscouraged their employees from thinking for themselves. Miles shook his\nhead. Well, he no longer followed the Survivor. He’d found something\nbetter, something that felt more true.\nThey sailed down past the outer ring of the Fourth and Fifth Octants. Two\nmassive buildings rose up opposite one another across the canal. The tops\ndisappeared into the mists. Tekiel Tower was on one side, the Ironspine on\nthe other.\nThe freight dock for the Ironspine was alongside its own branch from the\ncanal. They steered the barge into it, gliding to a stop, then used the dock’s\nstationary crane to lift the hidden train car off the barge. It was supposed to\nbe a big pile of rock, after all. They slowly swung it into the air, then over\nand gently down onto the platform.\nMiles jumped off the barge and onto the ground and walked to the\nplatform, joined by Push and Pull. The rest of his men filed in around him,\nlooking very pleased. Some were joking with one another about the bonus\nthey’d get for the heist.\nClamps looked very disturbed, and he scratched at the scars on his neck.\nHe was a Survivorist, his scars a mark of devotion. Tarson just yawned a\nwide, gray-lipped yawn, then cracked his knuckles.\nThe entire platform shook, then began to move, descending one story into"

Once they passed through, the doors closed above. The lift\nlurched slightly as it came to a stop. Miles looked to the side, down the long\ntunnel that Mister Suit claimed would someday provide train access under\nthe city. It looked hollow, empty, lifeless.\n“Hook up the chains,” Miles said, hopping off the platform. “Fix the train\ncar in place.”\n“Couldn’t we just wait?” Tarson asked, frowning. “It’ll open in twelve\nhours, right?”\n“I plan to be gone in twelve hours,” Miles said. “Wax and his people are\ntoo close. We’re going to crack that car open, deal with whoever’s inside,\nthen grab the aluminum and go. Get to work; let’s rip the door off.”\nHis men hastened to obey, tying the large train car to the wall with a large\nnumber of clamps and chains. Another set of chains was hooked to the\nBreaknaught’s door; these chains wrapped around the same powerful\nelectric winching mechanism that raised and lowered the platform. The\nplatform shook as it was disengaged, the motors instead engaging the chain\nwheels.\nMiles walked to the gun rack, selecting two aluminum handguns identical\nto the ones in his holsters. He was disturbed to notice that there was only\none other gun on the rack. They’d lost a fortune in weaponry. Well, he’d\njust have to see that Waxillium was duly repaid. Miles strode through the\nroom, chains clinking on the floor and men grunting. The air smelled of\ncoke from the inactive forges.\n“Arm up!” Miles ordered. “Get ready to fire on the person inside the\nmoment we open the thing.”\nThe Vanishers glanced at one another, confused, but then unslung or\nunholstered guns. He had about a dozen of them here, with some others in\nreserve. Just in case. Never put all your bullets in the same gun when\nWaxillium was around.\n“But boss,” one of the Vanishers called, “the report said the train left\nwithout the guards inside!”\nMiles cocked his gun. “If you find a building without rats, son, then you\nknow that something more dangerous scared them away.”\n“You think he’s in there?” Push said in a near monotone, stepping up\nbeside him. Obviously, he hadn’t heard Miles’s conversation about Wax on\nthe barge.\nMiles nodded.\n“And you brought him here.”\nMiles nodded again.\nPush’s face darkened. “You should have told us.”\n“You were given to me to help deal with him,” Miles said. “I just wanted\nto see you boys get your chance.” He turned. “Start the motor!”\nOne of the men pulled the lever, and the chains grew taut. They groaned,\npulling against the door. The train car rattled, but was kept in place by the\nother chains behind.\n“Be ready!” Miles called. “When the door opens, fire at anything that so\nmuch as quivers inside that car. Arm yourselves only with aluminum, and\ndon’t save ammunition. We can collect the bullets later and recast them.”\nThe train’s door buckled in its mountings, the metal groaning. Miles and"

Miles and\nhis men moved out to the sides, away from the path of the chains. Three\nhastily went to set up the rotary gun, but Miles waved them down. They\ndidn’t have aluminum bullets for that, so firing it could be a disaster against\na prepared Coinshot.\nMiles refocused his attention on the vault car. He stilled his breath and\nfelt his body grow warm as he increased the power he was tapping from his\nmetalmind. He didn’t need to breathe. His body renewed itself each\nmoment. He’d stop his heartbeat if he could. A heartbeat was such an\nannoyance when trying to aim.\nEven without breathing, he’d never been able to shoot as well as Wax. Of\ncourse, nobody could. The man seemed to have an inborn instinct for\nfirearms. Miles had seen him make shots he’d have sworn were impossible.\nIt almost seemed a shame to kill such a man. It would be like burning a one-\nof-a-kind painting, a masterpiece.\nBut it was what had to be done. Miles extended his arm, sighting with the\nrevolver. The door continued to warp, and the links in several of the chains\nbegan to show strain. But there were enough of them, and the motor was\nstrong enough, that the door’s bindings began to break. Scraps of metal\nsprang free, bolts snapping. One took Miles on the cheek, ripping skin. The\ncut regrew itself immediately. No pain. He only faintly remembered what\npain felt like.\nThen the door gave a final screech of death, ripping free and flying across\nthe room. It hit the ground, spraying sparks and skidding as the man at the\nlever hastily stopped the engine. The door came to a rest between the\nVanishers, who nervously trained their weapons on the dark interior of the\ncar.\nCome on, Wax, Miles thought. Play your hand. You’ve come to me. Into\nmy den, into my lair. You’re mine now.\nPoor fool. Wax never could stop himself if a woman was in danger.\nThat was when Miles noticed the string. Thin, almost invisible, it led\nfrom the fallen door to the inside of the railcar. It must have been tied to the\ndoor, then set inside in a loose pile with lots of slack. When they yanked the\ndoor off, the string didn’t snap, but was strung out along behind. What …\nMiles glanced again at the fallen door. Tape. Dynamite.\nAw, hell.\nSomeone inside the train car—hiding behind the box of aluminum—\npulled the string tight with a sudden jerk.\n18\nOutside, the entire room shook. Inside, the train car lurched—though it\nappeared someone had been kind enough to secure it in place, preventing\nWaxillium from being thrown about too much. He held on to the rope he’d\ntied around the strongbox, head down, Vindication up beside his ear.\nAs soon as the blast wave passed, he threw himself over the top of the\nbox and ducked out into the room. Smoke churned in the air; bits of stone\nand steel were scattered across the floor. Most of the lights had been\nknocked out by the explosion, and those that remained were swinging"

Most of the lights had been\nknocked out by the explosion, and those that remained were swinging\nwildly, painting the room with bewildering shadows.\nWaxillium scanned the devastation and did a quick count. At least four\nmen down. He probably could have hit more if he’d detonated the explosion\nearlier, but he’d worried about hurting innocents. He’d needed a moment to\nglance out and make sure that Steris or others weren’t near.\nWaxillium Pushed up and backward off a scrap of metal, throwing\nhimself into the air before any Vanishers could draw a bead on him. He\naimed Vindication as he flew, shooting one man who was rising and shaking\nhis head. Waxillium landed atop the train car and fired twice more with\nprecision, killing two more Vanishers.\nA ragged figure stood up on the side of the room, and Waxillium shot just\nbefore he recognized Miles. The left side of his suit coat and shirt had been\nshredded, but he’d already regrown his flesh, and now was lifting a gun of\nhis own.\nDamn, Waxillium thought, dropping down behind the wrecked train car.\nHe’d been hoping to find himself in a more traditional hideout, with narrow\nhallways and hidden nooks. Not this open stone pen of a room. It was going\nto be hard not to get boxed in here.\nHe glanced around the side of the railcar, and was met with a hail of fire\nfrom four or five different places. He ducked back around, hastily reloading\nVindication with ordinary rounds. He was pinned down already. This was\nnot going well.\nAnother of the room’s lights flickered, then went out. Fires started by the\nexplosion illuminated the room with a primal red glow. Waxillium crouched\ndown, Vindication held ready. He didn’t bother with a steel bubble; they\nwere all firing aluminum bullets.\nIt was either get pinned down and killed as they rounded the railcar, or\nrisk getting shot as he broke out. So be it. He kicked up a chunk of metal,\nthen Pushed it in front of him. It drew gunfire as he charged after it, Pushing\nbehind himself to rise soaring through the air. He turned sideways, firing as\nhe flew, mostly to force the enemy to keep their heads down. He managed\nto shoot one, however, before hitting the ground and sliding into the shadow\nof some fallen boxes.\nHe righted himself and reloaded hastily. His side was aching, bleeding\nthrough the bandage. The railcar was affixed to the north side of the room.\nHe’d dashed out to the west, and had ended up in the northwestern corner of\nthe room where the boxes were stacked. The western side, a little bit to the\nsouth of him, opened on some kind of tunnel. Maybe he could run that way.\nHe ducked around the side of the boxes and plugged one of the Vanishers\nin the forehead. Then he rolled into cover behind a larger stack of crates.\nSomeone was creeping around the boxes to his left; he could hear their\nsteps crunching on bits of rubble from the explosion. Waxillium raised his\ngun, stepped to the side, and fired."

Waxillium raised his\ngun, stepped to the side, and fired.\nThe black-suited man raised a casual hand. Tracking the bullet with the\nblue lines of an Allomancer, Waxillium could see it get flung back and hit\nthe wall above him. Great. A Coinshot. He rolled Vindication’s cylinder,\nlocking it into place. Unfortunately, fire from the other Vanishers forced\nhim back down before he could shoot the special round.\nThat Coinshot was close. Waxillium had to move quickly. He grabbed a\nfew of the weighted kerchiefs from his pockets and threw them out with\nPushes to draw fire, then worked his way around the right side of the boxes.\nHe had to keep in motion. It—\nHe came face-to-face with someone moving around the boxes to flank\nhim. The lean man had ashen skin and wore Wayne’s hat. Tarson, he’d been\ncalled at the other fight.\nTarson’s eyes widened in surprise and he swung a fist—never mind that it\nwas holding a revolver. The man was koloss-blooded, maybe a Pewterarm\nas well, considering how easily he’d recovered from being shot. Men like\nthat often punched first and thought about their guns second.\nWaxillium barely pulled back in time; he felt the fist brush past the tip of\nhis nose, then collide with one of the boxes, smashing it. He raised\nVindication, but Tarson—moving with supernatural quickness—slapped it\nout of his hand. Yes, a Pewterarm for certain. Koloss-blooded men were\nstrong, but not nearly that fast.\nReflexively, Waxillium Pushed himself backward. Going hand-to-hand\nwith this man would be suicide. It—\nThe roof exploded.\nWell, not the entire roof. Just the portion above Waxillium, where it\nlooked like the train car had been lowered on some kind of mechanical\nplatform. Waxillium ducked down as pieces of metal dropped; he Pushed\nsome away. Gunfire erupted above, and the Pewterarm ducked back before\nit, as a few bullets hit the boxes nearby.\nA figure dropped from above, wearing a duster and holding a pair of\ndueling canes. Wayne hit hard right beside Waxillium, grunting in pain, and\nthe distinctive shimmer of a speed bubble popped up around them.\n“Ouch,” Wayne said, rolling over and stretching out his leg, letting it heal\nfrom fracturing.\n“You didn’t need to jump down so quickly,” Waxillium said.\n“Oh yeah? Look up, muffin-brains.”\nWaxillium glanced upward. While he’d been fighting the Pewterarm, the\nblack-suited Coinshot had advanced. The man was landing in slow motion\natop the crates, revolver in hand, a puff of smoke coming out as a bullet\nslowly left the barrel. That barrel was pointed right at Waxillium’s head.\nWaxillium shivered, then took a deliberate step to the side. “Thanks.\nAnd … muffin-brains?”\n“Tryin’ out better insults,” Wayne said climbing to his feet. “You like the\nnew duster?”\n“Is that what took you so long? Please tell me you didn’t go shopping"

Please tell me you didn’t go shopping\nwhile I was fighting for my life.”\n“Had to take out three gits what was guarding the entrance up above,”\nWayne said, spinning his dueling canes. “One of them had this fine garment\nupon his person.” He hesitated. “I’m a little late ’cause I was trying to\nfigure a way to beat him up without ruining the coat.”\n“Great.”\n“Had Marasi shoot ’im in the foot,” Wayne said, grinning. “You ready to\ndo this thing? I’ll try to take our friend with the koloss blood there.”\n“Be careful,” Waxillium said. “He’s a Pewterarm.”\n“Charming. Y’always do introduce me to the most lovely of folks, Wax.\nMarasi’s going to cover us from above, keep the gunmen pinned down. Can\nyou handle the Coinshot?”\n“If I can’t, it’s time to retire.”\n“Oh. Is that what we’re calling ‘getting shot’ these days? I’ll remember\nthat. Ready?”\n“Go.”\nWayne dropped the speed bubble and rolled forward, surprising the\nPewterarm as he came around the boxes. The Coinshot’s bullet hit the\nground. Waxillium jumped for Vindication, which had fallen onto a nearby\nbox after being knocked from his hand.\nThe Coinshot moved by reflex, jumping down and Pushing on the gun.\nRanette was many things, but rich wasn’t one of them—and so Vindication\nwasn’t made of aluminum. The Coinshot’s Push threw the gun right at\nWaxillium’s head. He cursed, ducking, letting the gun pass above. He had\nother guns, of course, but they had only ordinary bullets.\nGuessing the Coinshot was trying to slam the gun into the wall and break\nit, Waxillium Pushed upward with everything he had, sending the gun\nsoaring up through the hole in the ceiling.\nWaxillium followed it, dropping a round and launching himself after his\nweapon. The Coinshot tried to fire on him, but a well-placed shot from\nMarasi—she was using aluminum bullets herself—nearly took him in the\nhead, causing him to duck away.\nWaxillium passed into a wave of mist that was falling into the room like a\nwaterfall. He burst into the dark, misty night sky and snatched Vindication\nfrom the air. He Pushed himself sideways off a lamppost as bullets zipped\nup after him, leaving trails in the mist.\nHe hit the building beside him and grabbed hold. Something dark soared\nout of the hole and into the air. The Coinshot. He was joined by a second\nman wearing black, also some kind of Allomancer, though the trajectory of\nhis flight looked more like that of a Lurcher.\nGreat. Waxillium pointed his gun downward and drove an ordinary bullet\ninto the ground, then Pushed down on it while decreasing his weight to\ndrive himself into the sky. The other two followed in graceful leaps, and\nWaxillium rolled the cylinder of Vindication and locked it on to the special\nchamber.\nGoodbye, he thought, firing right at the Coinshot’s head."

It hadn’t been a deliberate dodge, just a lucky motion. The\nbullet streaked uselessly into the mists past the man, who raised his own\ngun and fired a pair of shots, one of which clipped the side of Waxillium’s\narm.\nWaxillium cursed as his blood sprayed into the dark night, then Pushed\nhimself off to the side to move erratically and avoid their fire. Idiot! he\nthought, angry. Doesn’t matter how good your bullets are if you don’t aim\ncarefully.\nHe concentrated on staying ahead of the other two, jumping back and\nforth up the side of the enormous Ironspine Building. The Coinshot moved\nin graceful leaps after him, while the Lurcher was more direct, Pulling\nhimself on the metal in the building’s steel frame in bursts. He’d jump\noutward, then Pull himself upward and back toward the building, like a\nstrange inverse rappeller.\nBoth saved their bullets, waiting for the right shot. Waxillium did the\nsame, but for a different reason; he wasn’t certain firing on them would do\nany good. He needed to load another hazekiller round. And, if possible, he\nneeded to split up the two Allomancers so he could deal with them one at a\ntime.\nHe worked his way upward, pushing off the steel beneath the stone in the\nledges he landed upon. He soon ran into the same problem as the first time\nhe’d climbed this building. It grew narrower at the top, and he could go\nonly up and out, not in. This time, he didn’t have his shotguns. He’d given\nthose to Tillaume.\nHe did have that other hazekiller round, the one built to hit a Pewterarm\nespecially hard. He hesitated—should he save it for the man below?\nNo. If he died now, he’d never have another chance to face the man\nbelow. Waxillium reached out, pulling the trigger and thrusting himself\nbackward. It wasn’t as powerful as the shotgun, but as light as he was, it did\nnudge him back toward the building.\nThe Coinshot blew right past him in the air, looking surprised. The man\nleveled his gun, but Waxillium fired first. An ordinary round—but the\nCoinshot was forced to Push against it to keep it away. Waxillium Pushed at\nthe same time, and that shoved him to the building. The unfortunate\nCoinshot was launched out into the sky away from the tower.\nGood, Waxillium thought. Now over a hundred feet in the air, he grabbed\nthe facade. He fired down at the Lurcher, but the man was Pulling carefully.\nWaxillium’s bullet arced and hit the plate on the Lurcher’s chest.\nWaxillium hesitated for a moment, then let go of the wall, balancing as\nhe pulled his other revolver out of his second shoulder holster.\nHe emptied it, firing all six rounds in rapid succession.

Men lay broken on the floor,\nsome dead from the blast, others fallen to Waxillium’s shots. A large group\nof Vanishers had set up near the western tunnel, firing out at Wayne—who\nwas in full form, burning through his bendalloy like a madman. He’d\nappear, draw fire, then vanish into a blur, and appear right next to where\nhe’d been. He called insults as the bullets missed him, then moved again.\nThe gunmen kept trying to guess where he’d appear next, but that was a\nfruitless game. Wayne could slow time, see where the bullets were heading,\nthen walk to a place where they wouldn’t hit. It took a great deal of luck\nand skill to hit a Slider who knew you were there.\nImpressive as it was, though, it was a delaying tactic. With so many men\nfiring on him, Wayne couldn’t risk moving any closer. He had to wait\nmomentarily between creating speed bubbles, and if he was too close to the\nmen, there was a good chance they’d be able to aim, shoot, and hit him in\nthe seconds that he was exposed. The longer Wayne tried to dodge, the\nbetter the men shooting at him would get at judging the pauses. If he tried it\ntoo long, he’d get hit.\nWaxillium took in the scene, then held out a hand to Marasi. “Dynamite.”\nShe handed him her stick.\n“Find cover. Try and hit that Coinshot when he comes down for us.”\nWaxillium dashed into the room, firing without looking toward the group of"

They cried out, ducking for cover. Waxillium reached Wayne as a\nspeed bubble went up.\n“Thanks,” Wayne said. Streaks of sweat ran down the sides of his face,\nthough he was grinning.\n“The Pewterarm?” Waxillium asked.\n“We fought to a standstill,” Wayne said. “Bastard is fast.”\nWaxillium nodded. Pewter burners always gave Wayne trouble. Wayne\ncould heal far more quickly, but the Pewterarm’s powers made him fast and\nstrong. In a hand-to-hand fight, Wayne was at the disadvantage.\n“He still has my lucky hat,” Wayne noted, nodding to where the gray-\nskinned man stood behind the group of Vanishers, egging them on. “This\nlatest group came from that tunnel. I think there are more down there. Don’t\nknow why Miles hasn’t brought them in.”\n“Too many guns firing in a room this size gets more and more dangerous\nfor his men,” Waxillium said, looking about. “He’ll want reserves, try to\nwear us down. Where is Miles, by the way?”\n“Trying to flank me,” Wayne said. “I think he’s hiding to the side of the\ntrain car there.”\nWayne and he stood in the center of the room, train car behind and to the\nleft, boxes and crates behind and to the right, tunnel to the right.\nWaxillium could reach the train car pretty easily. “Great,” he said. “First\nplan to deal with Miles is still a go.”\n“I don’t think it’ll work.”\n“That’s why we have a second plan. But let’s hope this one does work.\nI’d rather not put Marasi in more danger.” Waxillium held up the dynamite.\nThere was no fuse—it was meant to be set off by pulling a detonator. “You\ngo for those men. I’ve got Miles. Ready?”\n“Yup.”\nWaxillium tossed the dynamite and Wayne dropped the speed bubble\nright before the dynamite hit the border. Any object—small ones\nparticularly—that left a speed bubble was deflected slightly in an\nunpredictable way. That was why firing bullets out of one was practically\nuseless.\nThe Vanishers looked up from their hiding places. The dynamite fell\ntoward them. Waxillium leveled Vindication and fired the last bullet in the\ncylinder at the falling dynamite.\nThe explosion shook the room, loud enough to set Waxillium’s ears\nringing. He spun, ignoring that, to see Miles step out from beside the\nbroken train car. Waxillium grabbed a handful of rounds and ran for the\nvault car, hastily ducking inside to find cover as he reloaded.\nA figure darkened the doorway a moment later. “Hello, Wax,” Miles said.\nHe stepped up into the vault car.\n“Hello, Miles.” Taking a deep breath, Waxillium Pushed against the\nmetal hooks above, which he’d affixed there to hold the nets in place.

They\nsprang free, dropping the nets around Miles.\nAs Miles jerked about in surprise, Waxillium Pushed on the clasps at the\nbottom of the nets, shooting them out of the gaping hole where the door had\nbeen. That pulled the nets tight at the bottom and yanked Miles’s feet out\nfrom under him.\nMiles hit the floor of the railcar’s interior, banging his head against the\nbox that held the aluminum. That probably wouldn’t even daze him, but the\nawkward fall did make him drop his gun. Waxillium leaped forward,\ngrabbing it and pulling it out of the nets; then he stood, breathing quickly.\nMiles thrashed at the nets. Despite his incredible healing powers, he\nwasn’t any stronger than an ordinary man. The trick wasn’t to kill him. It\nwas just to incapacitate him. Waxillium stepped forward, only now finding a\nchance to bind the wound on his arm. It wasn’t bad, but it was bleeding\nmore than he’d have liked.\nMiles looked up at him, growing calm. Then he reached into his pocket,\ngot out his cigar case, and pulled a small, slender stick of dynamite from it.\nWaxillium froze. He felt an awful moment of realization, followed by a\njolt of terror.\nAw, hell! He threw himself past Miles and out of the railcar. The\nawkward leap left him spinning in the air. He had a brief glance of Miles\nyanking at the dynamite’s blasting cap. The man was enveloped in a bright,\npowerful blast.\nThe explosion hurled Waxillium forward like a leaf before the wind. He\nsmashed to the ground, and his vision flashed. He lost a few moments.\nHe came to, bloodied, dazed, rolling to a stop. His head swam. He was\nunable to move or even think, his heart thumping in his chest.\nA figure stood up in the railcar. Waxillium’s vision was too blurry to\nmake out much, but he knew it was Miles. His clothing had been shredded,\nmuch of it blown off his body, but he was whole. He’d set off dynamite in\nhis hand in order to free himself from the nets.\nRust and Ruin … Waxillium thought, coughing. How badly was he hurt?\nHe rolled over, numb. That wasn’t a good sign.\n“Is there any doubt that I have been chosen for something great?” Miles\nbellowed. Waxillium could barely hear it; his ears were nearly useless after\nthat blast. “Why else would I have this power, Waxillium? Why else would\nwe be what we are? And yet, we let others rule. Let them make a mess of\nour world while we do nothing but chase petty criminals.”\nMiles hopped down from the train car, then strode forward, bare-chested,\ntrousers hanging in rags. “I am tired of doing what the city tells me. I\nshould be helping people, not fighting meaningless fights as prescribed by\nthe corrupt and the uncaring.”\nHe reached Waxillium, leaning down. “Can’t you see? Can’t you see\nwhat important work we could be doing? Can’t you see that we’re meant to"

Can’t you see that we’re meant to\nbe doing it, perhaps even ruling. It’s almost like … like we, with the powers\nwe have, are divine.” He seemed to almost be begging for Waxillium to\nagree, to give him justification.\nWaxillium just coughed.\n“Bah,” Miles said, straightening up. He flexed a hand. “You don’t think I\nrealize that the only way to stop me is to tie me up? A little explosion can\nserve a man so well, I’ve found. I keep the dynamite in the cigar cases. Few\npeople look there. You should have questioned the criminals I caught back\nin the Roughs. A few of them tried capturing me with ropes.”\n“I…” Waxillium coughed. His own voice sounded wrong in his ears. “I\ncouldn’t have talked to any of the criminals you caught. You killed them all,\nMiles.”\n“So I did,” Miles said. He grabbed Waxillium by the shoulder, hauling\nhim to his feet. “I see you dropped my gun as you jumped out of the train.\nWonderful.” He punched Waxillium in the stomach, causing him to exhale\nwith a grunt. Then Miles let him fall to the ground, wandering over toward\na gun lying nearby.\nDazed, but knowing he needed to get to cover, Waxillium somehow\nlurched to his feet. He Pushed against a piece of machinery and sent himself\nsailing across the room, where he landed beside the boxes. Those had been\nscattered in the blast, but they still provided some protection.\nCoughing, bleeding, he crawled behind them. Then he collapsed.\n* * *\nWayne spun between two Vanishers. He brought his dueling canes to the\nside, slamming them into the back of one of the men. He was rewarded with\na satisfying crack. The man fell.\nWayne grinned, dropping his speed bubble. The other man who had been\ntrapped in it with him spun about, trying to draw a bead on Wayne—but\nwhile sped up, he’d inadvertently moved into the path of several of his\ncomrades who’d been firing.\nThe Vanisher fell to a spray of bullets. Wayne jumped back, erecting\nanother bubble around just him and one confused Vanisher.\nEverything outside slowed—bullets stilled in the air, shouts vanished, the\nwaves diffusing as they hit the speed bubble. That did strange things to\nsound. Wayne spun about and knocked the gun out of the hands of the\nVanisher behind him, then lunged forward and rammed the end of a cane\ninto the man’s neck. The man gurgled in surprise; then Wayne smacked him\non the side of the head, dropping him.\nHe stepped back, puffing and spinning one of his canes. His bendalloy\nwas running low, so he ate another bit. His last. More worrisome were his\nmetalminds, which were almost completely spent. Again. He hated fighting\nthat way.

It was most disturbing.\nHe stepped up to the perimeter of his speed bubble, wishing it would\nmove with him. That Pewterarm was still wearing Wayne’s lucky hat; the\nman had ducked behind cover when Wax had thrown the dynamite, and had\nonly just emerged. He didn’t appear to have been injured badly; a few\nscrapes to his face, the sort of thing a Pewterarm could ignore. Too bad. But\nat least the hat was doing all right.\nThe man had begun to charge toward Wayne, moving extremely slowly,\nyet noticeably faster than the other Vanishers. It was frustrating, but Wayne\nknew he had to stay away from the man. He’d never beaten a Pewterarm\nwithout a lot of health stored up. Better to keep jumping around, keeping\nthe man confused until Marasi or Wax could shoot him a few times.\nWayne turned and scanned the area nearby, choosing where he should\nstand as he dropped the bubble. With so many bullets being fired, he didn’t\nwant to …\nWas that Wax?\nWayne gaped, only now noticing Waxillium’s bloodied form hurtling\nacross the room, as if by a Steelpush. Wax was pointed toward a group of\nboxes on the northwestern side of the room, to Wayne’s left. His suit had\nbeen shredded and burned along one side. Another explosion? Wayne\nthought he’d heard something, but jumping in and out of speed bubbles\ncould really play havoc with sounds.\nWax needed him. Time to end this fighting, then. Wayne dropped the\nbubble and dashed forward. He counted to two, then put up another bubble\nand dodged right. He dropped it and kept running, bullets streaking through\nthe air where he had been. To the eyes of those trying to track him, he’d\nhave blurred and appeared immediately to the right of where he’d just been.\nHe did it again, dodging back in another direction, then dropped the bubble.\nAlmost there. Another bubble up, and—\nSomething hit Wayne in the arm. He felt the blood before the pain,\nstrangely enough. He cursed, stumbling, and threw up a bubble\nimmediately.\nHe grabbed his arm. Warm blood squirted between his fingers, and in a\npanic, he tapped the last smidgen of healing in his metalmind. It wasn’t\nenough to fix the gunshot wound; it barely slowed the bleeding. He turned,\nnoticing another bullet about to hit his speed bubble. He jumped to the side\njust before it touched the perimeter, zipped through the air in a heartbeat,\nthen hit the other side and slowed again, deflected erratically up toward the\nceiling.\nDamn, Wayne thought, tying an improvised bandage on his wounded\narm. Someone has very good aim. He glanced about to find the black-suited\nCoinshot kneeling beside the wall, holding a familiar-looking rifle, sights on\nWayne. The rifle was the one Ranette had given to Marasi. Well, this is\ngoing to hell faster than bendalloy burns.\nHe spent a moment of hesitation. Wax was down. But Marasi … what\nhad happened to her? Wayne couldn’t spot her anywhere, though the\nCoinshot had cover beside some machinery, and he had her gun. That spoke\nloads."

That spoke\nloads.\nWax would want him to go help the girl.\nGritting his teeth, Wayne turned and dashed toward the Coinshot.\n* * *\nWaxillium groaned, stretching against the pain and pulling the small two-\nshooter from his ankle holster. He’d dropped Vindication in the blast—\nRanette was going to kill him for that—and he’d left his other gun up above\nwhen grabbing Marasi. He was down to this.\nHe unsuccessfully tried to cock the tiny pistol with a shaking hand. He\ndidn’t dare prod to feel the extent of his wounds. His leg and arm had been\nflayed.\nMist continued to flood down from the hole above. It had mostly\nenveloped this side of the room. With despair, Waxillium realized that his\ntwo-shooter had been damaged in the blast, and the hammer no longer\ncocked. Not that it would be of any use against Miles anyway.\nHe groaned again, leaning his head back against the floor. I thought I\nasked for a little help.\nA voice returned to him, distinct and unexpected. And a little is what you\nreceived, I think.\nWaxillium started. Well … could I have some more, then? Um, please?\nI must be careful in playing favorites, the voice inside his mind replied. It\nupsets the balance.\nYou’re God. Isn’t playing favorites kind of the point?\nNo, the voice replied. The point is Harmony, creating a way for as many\nas possible to make their own choices.\nWaxillium lay staring up at the swirling mists. The blast had dazed him\nworse than he’d thought.\nAre you divine, the voice asked of him, as Miles claims that Allomancers\nare?\nI … Waxillium thought. If I were, I doubt I’d be in this much pain.\nThen what are you?\nThis is a very bizarre conversation, Waxillium thought back.\nYes.\nHow can you see things like what has been done by the Vanishers,\nWaxillium asked, and not do something to help?\nI have done something to help. I sent you.\nWaxillium breathed out, blowing the mists in front of him. What Miles\nhad said bothered him: Is there any doubt we’ve been given this for a\nreason?\nWaxillium gritted his teeth, then forced himself to stand. He felt better in\nthe mists. The wounds didn’t seem so bad. The pain didn’t seem so sharp.\nBut he was still unarmed. Still cornered. Still …\nSuddenly he recognized the box right in front of him. It was his own\ntrunk. The one he’d taken with him when first leaving for the Roughs,\ntwenty years ago. The one—now battered and aged—he’d brought back\nwith him to the City.\nThe one he’d filled with his guns on that night months ago.

The Coinshot had come hunting her after what she’d done to his\nfriend. With his Allomancy, he’d have been able to see her wherever she\nran, despite the darkness and the mist, so she’d tucked the rifle behind a few\nboxes and hid elsewhere.\nIt felt cowardly, but it had worked. He’d shot a few times into the boxes,\nthen walked around and picked up the gun, looking baffled. He’d obviously\nexpected to find her bleeding and dead.\nInstead, she was simply unarmed. She had to get to a weapon, had to do\nsomething. Wayne had been shot; he’d lured the Coinshot away, but he’d\nbeen dripping blood when she’d seen him.\nThe room was chaos, and it left her disoriented. Wayne had told her that\nthe dynamite sticks they had were relatively small ones, but detonating\nthem in close confines was still enormously, painfully loud. The gunshots\nwere nearly so. The air smelled of smoke, and when gunshots weren’t\nsounding, she could faintly hear men groaning and cursing and dying.\nBefore the Vanishers had appeared at the wedding dinner, she’d never\nbeen in any kind of fight. Now she didn’t know what to do; she’d even lost\ntrack of which direction was which. The room was dark, lit only by\nflickering flames, and the mists made apparitions around her.\nSome Vanishers were huddled together, guarding the mouth of the tunnel\nwith the koloss-blooded man. She could barely make them out when she\npeered out of her hiding place. They held their guns leveled. She couldn’t\ngo that way.\nA figure strode from the darkness nearby, and she barely held in a gasp.\nShe recognized Miles Hundredlives from his description. Narrow face,\nshort dark hair. He was stripped to the waist, exposing a powerful chest. His\ntrousers were in tatters. He was counting the bullets in a revolver, and was\nthe only one in the room who wasn’t creeping or cowering. His legs kicked\nup mist, which now coated the floor.\nHe stopped by the Vanishers at the mouth of the tunnel and said\nsomething she couldn’t hear. They ducked away, retreating down the\npassage. Miles didn’t follow them, but strode through the room, getting\ncloser to Marasi. She held her breath, hoping he’d pass closely enough to\nher hiding place for …\nA rustle of cloth sounded, and the Coinshot dropped into place beside\nMiles. Miles stopped, raising an eyebrow.\n“Pull is dead,” the Coinshot said. Marasi could barely hear him, but she\ncould tell that his voice was taut with anger. “I’ve been trying to end the\nshort one. He keeps leading me on chases through the room.”\n“I believe I have said before,” Miles said, voice loud and bold, “that\nWayne and Waxillium are like rats. Chasing them is useless. You need to\ndraw them to you.”\nMarasi leaned forward, breathing shallowly, as quietly as she could.\nMiles was almost close enough. A few more steps …\nMiles snapped his revolver closed. “Waxillium crawled somewhere. I lost"

A few more steps …\nMiles snapped his revolver closed. “Waxillium crawled somewhere. I lost\nhim, but he’s wounded and unarmed.” Then Miles turned and pointed the\nrevolver directly at Marasi’s hiding place. “Call for him if you would, Lady\nMarasi.”\nShe froze, feeling a sharp stab of horror. Miles’s face was calm. Icy.\nEmotionless. He would kill her without a second thought.\n“Call for him,” Miles said more firmly. “Scream.”\nShe opened her mouth, but nothing came out. She could only stare at that\ngun. Her training in the university told her to do as he ordered, then run the\nmoment he turned away. But she couldn’t move.\nThe mist-shrouded shadows at the corner of the room began to shift. She\nripped her gaze away from Miles. Something dark moved in the mists. A\nman, standing up tall.\nThe mists seemed to draw back. Waxillium stood there, wearing a large,\ndusterlike coat, cut into strips below the waist. A pair of revolvers gleamed\nin holsters at his hips, and he rested a shotgun on each shoulder. His face\nwas bloodied, but he was smiling.\nWithout saying a word, he lowered the shotguns and blasted Miles in the\nside.\n19\nShooting Miles was, of course, useless. The man could survive a dynamite\nexplosion at close range. He could take a few shotgun blasts.\nBut the shots caused the Coinshot to Push himself away in alarm. They\nalso left Miles sprayed with metal. Wax increased his weight and Pushed,\nthough he found it hard to get a purchase on the birdshot. Any metal that\npierced a person’s body or touched his blood was very difficult to affect\nwith Allomancy.\nFortunately, Miles’s body obliged him by healing itself and spitting out\nthe birdshot. In the instant before it could drop to the floor, Wax’s Push\nsuddenly found anchors, and he threw Miles across the room and into the\nwall.\nThe Coinshot landed on the other side of the room. Waxillium dashed\nforward, mistcoat flapping. Damn, but it felt good to be wearing one of\nthose again. He skidded to a stop beside Marasi, taking cover next to the\nrailcar.\n“I almost had him,” Marasi said.\n“Waxillium!” Miles bellowed, his voice echoing in the room. “All you do\nis stall. Well, know this. My men have gone to kill the woman you came\nhere to save. If you want her to live, give yourself to me. We—”\nHis voice cut off strangely. Wax frowned as something moved behind\nMarasi. She jumped, and Wax pointed a shotgun, but it turned out to be\nWayne.\n“Hey,” he said, puffing. “Nice gun.”\n“Thanks,” Wax said, shouldering it, noting the speed bubble around\nthem. That was what had stopped Miles’s voice. “Your arm?”\nWayne glanced down at the bloody bandage around his left arm. “Not so\ngood. I’m outta healing, lost some blood. I’m slowing, Wax. Slowing too\nmuch. You look pretty beat-up yourself.”"

He always felt that way, in the mists.\n“The things he’s saying,” Marasi said. “You think he’s telling the truth?”\n“He might be, Wax,” Wayne said urgently. “The blokes who was set up in\nfront of the tunnel, they charged off a few shakes back. Looked like they\nhad something important to do.”\n“Miles did tell them something,” Marasi added.\n“Damn,” Wax said, glancing around the corner of the railcar. Miles might\nbe bluffing … but then again, he might not be. It wasn’t a chance Wax could\ntake. “That Coinshot is going to make things difficult. We need to take him\ndown.”\n“What happened to Ranette’s fancy gun?” Wayne asked.\n“Not sure,” Wax said with a grimace.\n“Wow. She’s gonna rip out your insides, mate.”\n“I’ll be sure to blame you for it,” Wax said, still watching the Coinshot.\n“He’s good. Dangerous. We’ll never take out Miles unless that Allomancer\nis dead.”\n“But you’ve got those special bullets,” Marasi noted.\n“One,” Wax said, slipping a shotgun into its holster inside his coat. He\npulled out the other Coinshot round. “I don’t think an ordinary revolver will\nfire this. I…”\nHe trailed off, then looked at Marasi. She was raising an eyebrow at him.\n“Right,” Wax said. “Can you two keep Miles busy?”\n“No problem,” Wayne said.\n“Let’s go, then,” Wax said, taking a deep breath. “One last try.”\nWayne met his eyes and nodded. Wax saw tension in his friend’s face.\nThe two of them were battered and bloodied, low on metals, metalminds\ndrained.\nBut they’d been here before. And this was when they tended to shine\ntheir brightest.\nAs the speed bubble fell, Wax ran out from behind the train car. He\ntossed the bullet into the air ahead of him, then Pushed on it with a quick\nsnap of power. The Coinshot raised his hand with casual confidence,\nPushing it right back at Wax.\nThe casing and bullet proper broke free and flipped toward Wax, who\ndeflected them easily, but the ceramic tip continued forward. It took the\nCoinshot right in the eye.\nBless you, Ranette, Wax thought, leaping up and Pushing off the coins in\na fallen Vanisher’s pocket. That launched him forward, into the tunnel.\nThere were tracks on the ground here, as if this were built for a train.\nWax frowned in puzzlement, but Pushed on them, heedlessly hurling\nhimself through the darkness until he reached a set of stairs leading upward.\nThe ceiling here was wood; a structure of some sort had been built over the\ntunnel.

Feet stomped up the steps behind him and men burst\nout of rooms nearby, fully armed, wearing no metal.\nWax smiled, raising his shotguns. All right.

Planks ripped free by their nails, making\nthe floor tremble, throwing off the Vanishers’ aim. He dodged right, rolling\nout of the hallway and into a room to its side. He came up and spun,\nleveling both shotguns back at the doorway.\nVanishers from the stairwell piled into the hallway after him, and his\narms jerked as he fired twin shotgun blasts. He Pushed, slamming the men\nback and sending himself crashing out the window. This building was more\nan old warehousing shed; there was no glass in the windows, just shutters.\nWax blasted out into open air. There was a lamppost on the dark street, a\nlittle bit to his left. He Pushed on that while at the same time dropping his\nweight to nearly nothing. The Push sent him back against the outside of the\nbuilding; he landed and half ran, half leaped parallel to the ground along the\nwall.\nReaching the next room over from where he’d been, he Pushed on\nanother lamppost and crashed through the window feet-first, splinters\nspraying around him.

A few straggling Vanishers climbed up\nthe stairs to his right; another group were leveling weapons to his left.\nHe Pushed on the twin metal levers on the sides of his shotguns, cocking\nthem with Allomancy. The spent casings flipped out into the air above the\nguns, and Waxillium fired while Pushing, driving birdshot and spent casings\ninto the waiting Vanishers on either side.\nThe floor next to Waxillium exploded.\nHe cursed, throwing himself to the left as gunfire from below blasted\nchips of wood into the air. They were getting smart, firing at him from\nunderneath. He turned and ran, firing shotgun blasts down through the floor,\nmists creeping in through the broken walls.\nThere had to be another dozen Vanishers below. Too many to fire at\nwithout being able to see them. A bullet grazed his thigh. He turned and\nducked away, leaping over the bodies of the fallen and dashing down the\nhallway. Bullets chased him, the floor splintering, men calling below as\nthey fired everything they had up at him.\nHe hit the door at the end of the hallway. It was locked. A healthy dose of\nincreased weight—along with some momentum and a shoulder—fixed that.\nHe crashed through and found himself in a small windowless room with no\nother doors.\nA short, balding man cowered in one corner. A woman with golden hair\nand a rumpled ball gown sat on a bench at the back of the room, her eyes\nred, her face haggard. Steris. She looked utterly dumbfounded as Wax spun\nthrough the broken doorway, mistcoat tassels flaring around him. He\nPushed on some of the nails in the floor back in the hall, causing the boards\nthere to ripple, drawing much of the gunfire.\n“Lord Waxillium?” Steris said, shocked.\n“Most of me,” he said, wincing. “I may have left a toe or two in that\nhallway.” He glanced at the man in the corner. “Who are you?”\n“Nouxil.”\n“The gunsmith,” Wax said, tossing him a shotgun.\n“I’m not actually a very good shot,” the man said, looking terrified. A\nfew bullets blasted up through the floor between them. The Vanishers had\nrealized they’d been tricked. They knew what he was looking for.\n“It doesn’t matter if you’re a good shot,” Wax said, raising his empty\nhand to the back wall and breaking it open with an increased-weight Push.\n“It matters if you can swim or not.”\n“What? Of course I can. But why—”\n“Hang on tightly,” Wax said as more gunshots erupted around him. He\nPushed on the shotgun in the gunsmith’s hands, flinging him out the\nopening, throwing him some thirty feet in an arc toward the canal outside."

Well, he was lucky to find even Steris. He Pushed\nlightly off the nails in the floor, propelling the two of them toward the\nceiling. As they approached, he took advantage of the fact that it didn’t\nmatter how heavy an object was when it came to falling. All objects fell at\nthe same rate. That meant that increasing his weight manyfold would not\naffect his motion.\nRaising his shotgun, he shot a concentrated blast of pellets into the\nceiling. Then he Pushed on them sharply, his increased weight meaning the\nPush didn’t really move him much—just as when he was lighter, a Push\naffected him greatly.\nThe result was that he continued his momentum upward—but his Push\nblasted a hole in the ceiling. He made himself incredibly light and Pushed\nmore strongly off the nails below. The two of them shot up through the hole\nhe’d made, propelled some forty or fifty feet into the air. He spun in the\nnight, mistcoat tassels splaying outward, smoking shotgun clutched tightly\nin one arm, Steris in the other. Bullets from below left streaks in the mist as\nit swirled around them.\nSteris gasped, clinging to him. Wax drew every bit of weight he had left,\ndraining his metalminds completely. That was hundreds upon hundreds of\nhours of weight, enough to make him crush paving stones if he tried to walk\non them. In the strange way of Feruchemy, he didn’t grow more dense—\nbullets would still cut through him easily if they hit. But with this incredible\nconflux of weight, his ability to Push grew incredible.\nHe used that weight to Push downward with everything he had. There\nwere numerous lines of metal below. Nails. Doorknobs. Guns. Personal\neffects.\nThe building trembled, then undulated, then ripped apart as every nail in\nits frame was driven downward as if propelled by a rotary gun. There was\nan enormous crash. The building was crushed down into the railroad tunnel\non top of which it had been built.\nThe weight was gone from him in an instant, compounded upon itself in\nthat moment, his metalminds drained all at once. Wax let gravity take him,\nand he dropped through the mists, Steris clinging to him. They landed in the\nmiddle of the wreckage at the bottom of the railroad tunnel. Smashed\nlumber and fragments of furniture were strewn across the floor.\nThree Vanishers stood in the mouth of the tunnel, openmouthed. Wax\nraised the shotgun and cocked it with Allomancy, then laid into them with\nshotgun blasts. They were the only ones that had still been standing.\nEveryone else had been crushed down into the tunnel.\nA small fire flickered in the corner where a lantern had fallen. By its\nlight, he checked on Steris, the mists pouring down around them and filling\nthe tunnel.\n“Oh Survivor of Mists!” Steris breathed, cheeks flushed, eyes wide, lips"

She didn’t look terrified. If anything, she seemed\naroused.\nYou are a bizarre woman, Steris, Wax thought.\n“Do you realize that you have missed your calling, Waxillium?” a voice\nyelled from within the blackened tunnel. It was Miles. “You are an army\nunto yourself. You are wasted in the life you’ve taken upon yourself.”\n“Take this,” Wax said softly to Steris, handing her the shotgun. He\ncocked it. One shell left. “Hold it tightly. I want you to run for the precinct\nstation. It’s at Fifteenth and Ruman. If one of the Vanishers comes for you,\nfire the shotgun.”\n“But—”\n“I don’t expect you to hit him,” Wax said. “I’ll listen for the sound of the\nshot.”\nShe tried to comment further, but Wax ducked down to get his center of\nmass beneath her, then carefully Pushed the shotgun up into her middle. He\nused it to launch her up and out of the pit. She landed awkwardly, but\nsafely, and hesitated only a moment before running off into the mists.\nWax scrambled to the side, making sure he wasn’t backlit by the fire. He\npulled a Sterrion from its holster and fished out some rounds. He reloaded\nas he crouched down.\n“Waxillium?” Miles called from deep inside the tunnel. “If you’re done\nplaying, perhaps you’d like to come settle things.”\nWax crept up to the tunnel mouth, then stepped inside. The mists had\nfilled it, making it difficult to see—which would work equally against\nMiles. He made his way forward cautiously until he saw the light from the\nbig workshop at the end, where fires still burned.\nBy that light, he could faintly make out the silhouette of a figure standing\nin the tunnel, holding a gun to the head of a slender woman. Marasi.\nWaxillium froze, pulse accelerating. But no, this was part of the plan. It\nwas perfect. Except …\n“I know you’re in there,” Miles’s voice said. Another figure moved,\ntossing a few improvised torches into the darkness.\nWith a freezing sense of horror, Waxillium realized that Miles wasn’t the\none holding Marasi. He stood too far back. The man holding Marasi was the\none named Tarson, the koloss-blooded Pewterarm.\nHer face illuminated by wavering torchlight, Marasi looked terrified.\nWaxillium’s fingers felt slick on the revolver’s grip. The Pewterarm was\ncareful to keep Marasi between himself and Waxillium’s side of the tunnel,\ngun to the back of her head. He was squat and tough, but not very tall. He\nwas only in his twenties—like all koloss-blooded, he’d continue growing\ntaller throughout his life.\nEither way, at the moment, Waxillium couldn’t get a bead on him. Oh,\nHarmony, he thought. It’s happening again.\nSomething rustled in the darkness nearby. He jumped and nearly shot it\nuntil he caught the outline of Wayne’s face."

He jumped and nearly shot it\nuntil he caught the outline of Wayne’s face.\n“Sorry about this,” Wayne whispered. “When she got grabbed, I thought\nit was Miles. And so I—”\n“It’s all right,” Waxillium said softly.\n“What do we do?” Wayne asked.\n“I don’t know.”\n“You always know.”\nWaxillium was silent.\n“I can hear you whispering!” Miles called. He walked forward and tossed\nanother torch.\nJust a few steps more, Waxillium thought.\nMiles stopped where he was, eyeing the creeping mists with what seemed\nlike distrust. Marasi whimpered. Then she tried jerking, the way she had\nback at the wedding dinner.\n“None of that,” Tarson said, holding her carefully. He fired a shot right in\nfront of her face, then brought the gun back to her head. She froze.\nWaxillium raised his revolver.\nI can’t do this. I can’t watch another one die. Not by my hand.\n“All right,” Miles called. “Fine. You want to test me, Wax? I’m counting\nto three. If I reach three, Tarson shoots, no other warnings. One.”\nHe’ll do it, Waxillium realized, feeling helpless, guilty, overwhelmed. He\nreally will. Miles didn’t need a hostage. If threatening her wouldn’t bring\nWaxillium out, then he wouldn’t bother with her.\n“Two.”\nBlood on the bricks. A smiling face.\n“Wax?” Wayne whispered, sounding urgent.\nOh, Harmony, if I’ve ever needed you …\nMist curled around his legs.\n“Th—”\n“Wayne!” Waxillium yelled, standing.\nThe speed bubble went up. Tarson would fire in mere moments. Miles\nbehind him, pointing angrily. Torchfire frozen. It was like watching an\nexplosion in slow motion again. Waxillium raised his Sterrion, and found\nhis arm incredibly still.\nIt had been still on the day he’d shot Lessie, too.\nHe’d shot her with this very gun.\nSweating, trying to banish the images from his head, he tried to find a\nclear shot at Tarson. There wasn’t one. Oh, he could hit Tarson, but not\nanywhere that would drop him immediately. And if Waxillium didn’t hit\njust right, the man would shoot Marasi by reflex.\nThe head was the best way to drop a Pewterarm. Only, Waxillium\ncouldn’t see the head. Could he shoot the gun? Marasi’s face was in the\nway. The knees? He might be able to hit a knee. No. A Pewterarm would\nignore most hits—if the damage wasn’t immediately lethal, he’d stay up,\nand he’d shoot.\nIt had to be the head.\nWaxillium held his breath. This is the most accurate gun I’ve ever fired,\nhe thought. I can’t sit here, frozen. I have to act.\nI have to do something.\nSweat dripped off his chin. He raised his hand with a quick motion in\nfront of him, then pointed the Sterrion to the side, off center from Marasi or\nTarson. Wax fired."

He\nwatched it go, judging its new trajectory. It moved forward sluggishly,\nspinning as it cut through the air.\nWax took careful aim, waited several excruciating moments. Then he\nreadied his steel.\n“Drop it on my mark,” he whispered.\nWayne nodded.\n“Go.”\nWax fired and Pushed.\nThe speed bubble fell.\n“—ee!” Miles called.\nA small shower of sparks exploded in the air as Wax’s second bullet,\npropelled with incredible speed by his Steelpush, clipped the other one in\nmidair and deflected it to the side: behind Marasi, into Tarson’s head.\nThe Pewterarm dropped immediately, gun slapping to the ground, eyes\nstaring dully upward. Miles gaped. Marasi blinked, then turned about,\nraising her arms to her chest.\n“Aw, biscuits,” Wayne said. “Did you have to hit him in the head? That\nwas my lucky hat he was wearin’.”\nMiles recovered his wits and raised his revolver toward Wax. Wax turned\nand fired first, hitting Miles’s hand, dropping his gun to the ground. Wax\nshot it, knocking it backward into the other room.\n“Stop doing that!” Miles screamed. “You bast—”\nWax shot him in the mouth, driving him backward a step, throwing out\nchips of tooth. Miles still wore only the tattered remnants of his trousers.\n“Somebody shoulda done that ages ago,” Wayne muttered.\n“It won’t last,” Wax said, plugging Miles in the face again to try to keep\nhim disoriented. “Time for you to be off, Wayne. Backup plan is still a go.”\n“You sure you got them all, mate?”\n“Tarson was the last.” And I’d better not be wrong.…\n“Grab my hat if you get the chance,” Wayne said, scrambling away as\nWax shot Miles in the face again. This hit barely bothered him, and the half-\nnaked man lurched forward. Toward Marasi. Miles was unarmed, but there\nwas murder in his eyes.\nWax dashed forward, throwing the empty gun at Miles, then fishing out a\nhandful of bullets. He Pushed them toward the former lawman. One sliced\nhim in the arm, one cut through his gut and came out the other side, but\nnone lodged in a way that Wax could push them to shove Miles back.\nWax hit Miles just before he reached Marasi. The two went down in a\nheap on the dirty ground, under the mists rolling across the floor.\nWax grabbed Miles by the shoulder and started punching. Just … keep …\nhim busy …\nMiles showed a flash of amusement through the annoyance. He took a\nfew of the punches, Wax’s fist growing sore in the process. Wax could\npunch until his knuckles broke and his hand was reduced to a bloody mess,\nand Miles would be no worse for the wear.\n“I knew you’d go for the girl,” Wax said, holding Miles’s attention. “You"

Pain flared in Wax’s chest as he was\nthrown back into a muddy portion of the tunnel, cold water splashing\naround him, soaking his mistcoat.\nMiles stood up, wiping some blood off his lip where it had split, then\nhealed. “You know the really sad thing, Wax? I understand you. I’ve felt\nlike you, I’ve thought like you. But there was always that distant, rumbling\ndissatisfaction within. Like a storm on the horizon.”\nWax got to his feet and rammed a fist into Miles’s kidney. It didn’t even\nget a grunt. Miles grabbed him by the arm, twisting it, causing his shoulder\nto flare with pain. Wax gasped, and Miles kicked the back of his knee,\nsending him to the ground again.\nAs Wax tried to roll over, Miles grabbed him by the front of his shirt and\nhauled him up, then laid into him with a fist to the face. Marasi gasped,\nthough she had been told to stay back. She did her part.\nThe punch slammed Wax down to the ground, and he tasted blood. Rust\nand Ruin … he’d be lucky if his jaw wasn’t broken. He also felt like he’d\nripped something in his shoulder.\nHis wounds suddenly seemed to crash down upon him. He didn’t know if\nit was the mists, some action of Harmony, or simple adrenaline that had\nhelped him ignore them for a time. But he hadn’t been healed. His side\nscreamed from where he’d been shot, and his leg and arm had been burned\nand scraped raw by the explosion. He’d been clipped by bullets in the thigh\nand the arm. And now, Miles’s beating.\nIt overwhelmed him, and he groaned, slumping down, struggling to\nmerely remain conscious. Miles pulled him up again, and Wax managed to\nget in one thrashing swing that connected. And did nothing. It was very,\nvery difficult to brawl with a man who didn’t flinch when you hit him.\nAnother punch sent Wax to the ground again, head ringing, eyes seeing\nstars and flashes of light.\nMiles leaned down, speaking in his ear. “Thing is, Waxillium, I know you\nfeel it too. A part of you knows that you’re being used, that nobody cares\nabout the downtrodden. You’re just a puppet. People are murdered every\nday this city. At least one a day. Did you know that?”\n“I…” Keep him talking. He rolled onto his back, aching, meeting Miles’s\neyes.\n“People murdered every day,” Miles repeated, “and what was it that\nbrought you out of your ‘retirement’? When I shot an old, would-be\naristocratic wolfhound in the head. Did you ever stop to think of all the\nother people being killed in the streets? The beggars, the whores, the\norphans? Dead because of lack of food, or because they were in the wrong\nplace, or because they tried something stupid.”"

This isn’t the Final Empire of legend. A rich man\ncan’t kill a poor one just because he feels like it. We’ve gotten better than\nthat.”\n“Bah!” Miles said. “They pretend and lie to make a good show.”\n“No,” Waxillium said. “They have good intentions, and make laws that\nprevent the worst of it—but those laws still fall short. It’s not the same\nthing.”\nMiles kicked him in the side to keep him down. “I don’t care about the\nSurvivor’s mandate. I’ve found something better. That doesn’t matter to\nyou. You’re just a sword, a tool that goes where it’s pointed. It rips you\napart that you can’t stop the things that you know you should. Doesn’t it?”\nThey met eyes. And, shockingly—despite the agony—Waxillium found\nhimself nodding. Truthfully nodding. He did feel it. That was why what had\nhappened to Miles terrified him.\n“Well, someone has to do something about it,” Miles said.\nHarmony, Waxillium thought. If Miles had been born back then, in the\ndays before, he’d have been a hero. “I’ll start helping them, Miles,”\nWaxillium said. “I promise it to you.”\nMiles shook his head. “You won’t live that long, Wax. Sorry.” He kicked\nagain. And again. And again.\nWaxillium curled around himself, hands over his face. He couldn’t fight.\nHe just had to last. But the pain was mounting. It was terrible.\n“Stop it!” Marasi’s voice. “Stop it, you monster!”\nThe kicks stopped falling. Waxillium felt her beside him, kneeling, hand\non his shoulder.\nFool woman. Stay back. Unnoticed. That was the plan.\nMiles cracked his knuckles audibly. “I suppose I should deliver you to\nSuit, girl. You’re on his list, and you can replace the one Waxillium set free.\nI’ll probably have to track her down.”\n“Why is it,” Marasi said angrily, “that small-minded men must destroy\nthat which they know is better, and greater, than they?”\n“Better than me?” Miles said. “This? He isn’t great, child.”\n“The greatest of men can be taken down by the simplest of things. A\nlowly bullet can end the life of the most powerful, most capable, most\nsecure of men.”\n“Not me,” Miles said. “Bullets are nothing to me.”\n“No,” she replied. “You’ll be brought down by something even more\nlowly.”\n“Which is?” he asked, amused, voice growing closer.\n“Me,” Marasi replied.\nMiles laughed. “I’d like to see…” He trailed off.\nWaxillium cracked his eyes, looking down the length of the tunnel\ntoward the broken ceiling where the building had stood. Light flooded that\npit from above, growing brighter at a remarkable rate."

Light flooded that\npit from above, growing brighter at a remarkable rate.\n“Who have you brought?” Miles asked, sounding unimpressed. “They\nwon’t arrive quickly enough.” He paused. Waxillium rolled his head to the\nside and saw the sudden horror in Miles’s face. He had seen it, finally: a\nshimmering border nearby, a slight difference in the air. Like the distortion\ncaused by heat rising from a hot street.\nA speed bubble.\nMiles spun on Marasi. Then he ran for the bubble’s border, away from\nthe light. Trying to escape.\nThe light at the other end of the tunnel became bright, and a group of\nblurs moved down it, so quickly it was impossible to distinguish what was\ncausing them.\nMarasi dropped her bubble. The sunlight of full day streamed in from the\ndistant pit, and filling the tunnel—right outside where the bubble had been\n—was a force of over a hundred constables in uniform. Wayne stood at their\nhead, grinning, wearing a constable’s uniform and hat, a false mustache on\nhis face.\n“Get ’im, boys!” he said, pointing.\nThey moved in with clubs, not bothering with guns. Miles screamed in\ndenial, trying to dodge past the first few, then punching at the group that\nlaid hands on him. He wasn’t fast enough, and there were far too many of\nthem. In minutes, they had him held down against the ground and were\nwrapping ropes around his arms.\nWaxillium sat up with care, one eye swelling closed, lip bleeding, side\naching. Marasi knelt beside him, anxious.\n“You shouldn’t have confronted him,” Waxillium said, tasting blood. “If\nhe’d knocked you out, that would have been the end of it.”\n“Oh, hush,” she said. “You aren’t the only one who can take risks.”\nThe backup plan had been straightforward, if difficult. It had begun with\neliminating all of Miles’s lackeys. Even one of them, left alive, could have\nnoticed what the speed bubble meant and shot Waxillium and Marasi from\nthe outside. There wouldn’t have been anything they could have done to\nprevent it.\nBut if the lackeys were gone, and if Miles could be distracted long\nenough while the bubble was up, Wayne could go to gather a large force to\nsurround Miles while he was helpless. He’d never have let it happen if he’d\nsuspected. But within the speed bubble …\n“No!” Miles screamed. “Unhand me. I defy your oppression!”\n“You are a fool,” Waxillium said to him, then spat blood to the side. “You\nlet yourself get isolated and distracted, Miles. You forgot the first rule of the\nRoughs.”\nMiles screamed, one of the constables pulling a gag over his mouth as he\nwas tied tightly.\n“The more alone you are,” Waxillium said softly, “the more important it\nis to have someone you can rely upon.”\n20\n“The constable-general has decided not to charge your associate for\nimpersonating an officer of the law,” Reddi said.\nWaxillium dabbed at his lip with the handkerchief.

He sat in the precinct\noffice nearest the Vanisher lair. He felt like slag, with broken ribs and half\nhis body wrapped in bandages. He’d have scars from this.\n“The constable-general,” Marasi said, voice hard, “should be glad for\nLord Waxillium’s aid—in fact, he should have begged for Lord Waxillium’s\nhelp all along.” She sat beside him on the bench, hovering protectively.\n“He actually does seem glad,” Reddi said. Now that Waxillium paid\ncloser attention, he noticed how the constable kept glancing through the\nprecinct room toward Brettin, the constable-general. Reddi’s eyes narrowed\nslightly, lips turning down. He was baffled by his superior’s calm reaction\nto events.\nWaxillium was too exhausted at the moment to bother with the anomaly.\nIn fact, it was nice to hear of something happening in his favor.\nReddi was called over by one of the other constables, and he left. Marasi\nlaid a hand on Waxillium’s good arm. He could practically feel her concern\nfor him physically in the way she hesitated, the way her brow wrinkled.\n“You did well,” Waxillium said. “Miles was your catch, Lady Marasi.”\n“I’m not the one who had to be beaten bloody.”\n“Wounds heal,” Waxillium said, “even on an old horse like me. Watching\nhim attack me and doing nothing … I’ll bet that was excruciating. I don’t\nthink I could have stood it, if our places had been reversed.”\n“You’d have done it. You’re like that. You’re every bit the man I thought\nyou might be, yet somehow more real at the same time.” She looked at him,\neyes wide, lips pursed. As if she wanted to say more. He could read her\nintent in those eyes.\n“This isn’t going to work, Lady Marasi,” he said gently. “I’m thankful for\nyour aid. Very thankful. But the thing you wish between us is not viable.\nI’m sorry.”\nNot unexpectedly, she blushed. “Of course. I wasn’t implying such a\nthing.” She forced a laugh. “Why would you think—I mean, it’s silly!”\n“I apologize, then,” he said. Though, of course, they both knew what the\nexchange had meant. He felt a deep regret. If I were ten years younger …\nIt wasn’t the age per se. It was what those years had done to him. When\nyou watched a woman you loved die by your own gunshot, when you saw\nan old colleague and respected lawkeeper turn bad, it did things to you.\nRipped you up inside. And those wounds, they didn’t heal nearly as easily\nas the bodily ones.\nThis woman was young, full of life. She didn’t deserve someone who\nwas basically all scars wrapped up in a thick skin of sun-dried leather.\nEventually, Constable-General Brettin walked over to them. He was as\nstiff-backed as before, constable’s hat carried under his arm. “Lord\nWaxillium,” he said in a monotone.\n“Constable-General.”"

I have backdated the request, and if\nwe are in luck, nobody will realize you were working alone this past night.\nAlso, I do not wish for you to feel that you need to work alone. This city\ncould use your expertise.”\n“With all due respect, sir,” Waxillium said, “that’s quite a change from\nyour previous stance.”\n“I have had occasion to change my mind,” Brettin said. “You should\nknow that I will soon be retiring. A new constable-general will be appointed\nin my position, but he will be required to accept the Senate’s mandate\nregarding you, should this motion be accepted.”\n“I…” Waxillium was uncertain how to reply. “Thank you.”\n“It’s for the good of the City.

It was unexpectedly heavy. “Got you another of\nthose guns.”\nWaxillium sighed.\n“Don’t worry,” Wayne said, “I traded a real nice scarf for it.”\n“And where did you get the scarf?”\n“Off one of the dead blokes you shot,” Wayne said. “So it wasn’t stealin’.\nHe ain’t gonna need it, after all.” He seemed quite proud of himself.\nWaxillium tucked the gun into his empty holster. The other holster held\nVindication. Marasi had searched through the hideout after Miles was taken\nand had recovered it for him. That was good. It would have been sad to\nsurvive this night, only to have Ranette kill him.\n“So,” Marasi said, “you traded a dead man’s scarf for another dead man’s\ngun. But … the gun itself belonged to someone dead, so by the same logic\n—”\n“Don’t try,” Waxillium said. “Logic doesn’t work on Wayne.”\n“I bought a ward against it off a traveling fortune-teller,” Wayne\nexplained. “It lets me add two ’n’ two and get a pickle.”\n“I … have no response to that,” Marasi said.\n“Technically that was a response,” Wayne said.\n“Looks like they fished that gunsmith outta the canal for you, Wax, and\nhe’s alive. Not real happy, but alive.”"

Not real happy, but alive.”\n“Has anyone found anything regarding the other women who were\nkidnapped?” Waxillium asked.\nWayne glanced at Marasi, who shook her head. “Nothing. Maybe Miles\nwill know where they are.”\nIf he’ll talk, Waxillium thought. Miles had stopped feeling pain long ago.\nWaxillium wasn’t certain how anyone would go about interrogating him.\nWaxillium felt that by not rescuing the other women, he had failed in\nlarge measure. He’d vowed to get Steris back, and he had. But a greater evil\nhad been done.\nHe sighed as the door to the captain’s office opened, and Steris stepped\nout. A pair of senior constables had taken her statement, after taking that of\nWaxillium and Wayne. The two constables waved for Marasi next, and she\nwent, glancing over her shoulder at Waxillium. He’d told her to be frank\nand straightforward with them, and to not hide anything he or Wayne had\ndone. Though, if she could, she was to obscure Ranette’s role.\nWayne wandered over to where some constables were eating morning\nsandwiches. They regarded him with suspicion, but—by experience—\nWaxillium knew that Wayne would soon have them laughing and asking\nhim to join them. Does he even understand what he does? Waxillium\nwondered as Wayne launched into an explanation of the fight for the\nconstables. Or does he just do it all by instinct?\nWaxillium watched for a moment before realizing that Steris had\napproached him. She sat down in the chair directly across from him,\nmaintaining good posture. She had fixed her hair, and while her dress was\nrumpled from her day of captivity, she looked relatively composed.\n“Lord Waxillium,” she said. “I find it necessary to offer you my thanks.”\n“I hope the necessity isn’t too onerous,” Waxillium said with a grunt.\n“Only in that it comes … is required … after an onerous captivity. You\nshould know that I was not touched indecently by my captors. I remain\npure.”\n“Rust and Ruin, Steris! I’m glad, but I didn’t need to know that.”\n“You did,” she said, face impassive. “Assuming you still wish to proceed\nwith our nuptials.”\n“It wouldn’t matter either way. Besides, I thought we weren’t to that\npoint yet. We haven’t even announced that we are seeing one another.”\n“Yes, though I believe we can now amend our previous timetable. You\nsee, a dramatic rescue such as you have effected will be expected to create\nan outpouring of my emotions. What once might have been a scandal will\ninstead be viewed as romantic. We could plausibly announce an\nengagement next week and have it be accepted in high society without\nconcern or comment.”\n“That’s good, I suppose.”\n“Yes. Shall I proceed with our contract, then?”\n“You don’t mind that I’ve returned to the miscreant ways of my past?”\n“I rather think that I would soon be dead if you had not,” Steris said. “I\nam not in a position to complain.”"

But I’ve received a forbearance—and an offer—\nto be involved in constabulary business in the city. I plan to take on the\noccasional problem that needs extra attention.”\n“Every gentleman needs a hobby,” she said evenly. “And, considering the\nself-indulgences of some men I’ve known, this wouldn’t be problematic by\ncomparison.” She leaned forward. “In short, my lord, I see you for what you\nare. The two of us, we are beyond the points in our lives where expecting\nthe other to change would be realistic. I will accept this about you if you\nwill accept me. I am not without my faults, as my previous three suitors\nchose to explain to me—at length—in written communication.”\n“I hadn’t realized.”\n“It is not an issue worthy of your attention, really,” she said. “Though I\ndid think that you’d have realized I did not come to this potential union\nwithout—no offense—a measure of desperation.”\n“I understand.”\nSteris hesitated; then a bit of her coldness seemed to depart. Some of her\ncontrol, her steely will, fell away. She looked tired, suddenly. Worn. Though\nbehind that mask, he saw something that might have been affection for him.\nShe clasped her hands before her. “I am not … good with people, Lord\nWaxillium. I realize it. I must stress, however, that you have my thanks for\nwhat you have done. I speak it from the depths of all that I am. Thank you.”\nHe met her eyes, and nodded.\n“So,” she said, growing more businesslike. “We progress with our\nengagement?”\nHe hesitated. There was no reason not to, but a part of him found that he\nthought himself a coward. Of the two offers this day—one unspoken, the\nother blunt—this was the one he was contemplating?\nHe glanced toward the room where Marasi was giving the report of her\ninvolvement in this mess. She was entrancing. Beautiful, intelligent,\nmotivated. By all logic and reason, he should have been completely\ninfatuated with her.\nIn fact, she reminded him a lot of Lessie. Perhaps that was the problem.\n“We move forward,” he said, turning back to Steris.\nEPILOGUE\nMarasi attended Miles’s execution.\nDaius, the senior prosecutor, had counseled against it. He never attended\nexecutions.\nShe sat on the outer balcony, alone, watching Miles walk up the steps to\nthe firing platform. Her position was above the execution site.\nShe narrowed her eyes, remembering Miles standing in that underground\nroom of darkness and mist, pointing a gun at her hiding place. She’d had a\ngun to her head three times during that two-day span, but the only time\nshe’d really believed that she would die had been when she had seen the\nlook in Miles’s eyes.

The time between the Vanisher attack at the wedding and\nMiles’s capture had been less than a day and a half. Yet she felt like during\nthat time she’d aged two decades. It was like a form of temporal Allomancy,\na speed bubble around her alone. The world was different now. She’d nearly\nbeen killed, she’d killed for the first time, she’d fallen in love and been\nrejected. Now she’d helped condemn to death a former hero of the Roughs.\nMiles looked with contempt on the constables who tied him to the\nrestraining pole. He’d shown that same expression through most of the trial\n—the first one she’d helped prosecute as an attorney, though Daius had\nbeen the lead on the case. The trial had gone quickly, despite its high-profile\nand high-stakes nature. Miles had not denied his crimes.\nIt seemed that he saw himself as immortal. Even standing up there—his\nmetalminds removed, a dozen rifles cocked and pointed toward him—he\ndidn’t seem to believe he would die. The human mind was very clever at\ntricking itself, at keeping the despair of inevitability at bay. She’d known\nthat look in Miles’s eyes. Every man had it, when young. And every man\neventually saw it as a lie.\nThe rifles went to shoulders. Perhaps now Miles would finally recognize\nthat lie himself. As the guns fired, Marasi found that she was satisfied. And\nthat disturbed her greatly.\n* * *\nWaxillium boarded the train at Dryport. His leg still ached, he walked with\na cane, and he wore a bandage around his chest to help with the broken ribs.\nOne week wasn’t nearly enough time to heal from what he’d been through.\nHe probably shouldn’t have left his bed.\nHe limped down the corridor of the lavish first-class carriage, passing\nhandsomely appointed private rooms. He counted off to the third\ncompartment as the train labored into motion. He walked into the chamber,\nleaving the door open, and sat down in one of the well-stuffed chairs by the\nwindow. It was affixed to the floor, and sat before a small table with a long,\nsingle leg. It was curved and slender, like a woman’s neck.\nA short time later, he heard footsteps in the corridor. They hesitated at the\ndoorway.\nWaxillium watched the scenery passing outside. “Hello, Uncle,” he said,\nturning to look at the man in the doorway.\nLord Edwarn Ladrian stepped into the room, walking with a whale-ivory\ncane and wearing fine clothing. “How did you find me?” he asked, sitting\ndown in the other chair.\n“A few of the Vanishers we interrogated,” Waxillium said. “They\ndescribed a man that Miles called ‘Mister Suit.’ I don’t think anyone else\nrecognized you in the description. From what I understand, you were\nhermitlike during the decade leading up to your ‘death.’ Save for your\nletters to the broadsheets about political matters, of course.”\nThat didn’t answer the question exactly.

        "text": "letters to the broadsheets about political matters, of course.”\nThat didn’t answer the question exactly. Waxillium had found this train,\nand this car, based on the numbers written in Miles’s cigar box, the one\nWayne had found. Railway routes. Everyone else thought they had been\ntrains the Vanishers had been planning to hit, but Waxillium had seen a\ndifferent pattern. Miles had been tracking Mister Suit’s movements.\n“Interesting,” Lord Edwarn said. He took a handkerchief out of his\npocket and wiped his fingers as a servant entered, bringing a tray of food\nand setting it on the table in front of him. Another poured him wine. He\nwaved for them to wait outside the door.\n“Where is Telsin?” Waxillium asked.\n“Your sister is safe.”\nWaxillium closed his eyes, and fought down the welling of emotion.\nHe’d thought her dead in the wreck that supposedly claimed his uncle’s life,\nbut had dealt with his emotions, such as they were. It had been years since\nhe’d seen his sister.\nWhy, then, was finding out that she lived so powerfully meaningful to\nhim? He couldn’t even define which emotions he was feeling.\nHe forced his eyes open. Lord Edwarn was watching him, holding a glass\nof crystalline white wine in his fingers. “You suspected,” Edwarn said. “All\nalong, you suspected I wasn’t dead. That’s why you recognized whatever\ndescription those ruffians were able to give. I’ve changed clothing styles,\nmy haircut, and even shaved my beard.”\n“You shouldn’t have had your butler try to kill me,” Waxillium said. “He\nwas too long in the family employ, and he was too ready to kill me, to have\nbeen hired by the Vanishers on such short notice. It meant he was working\nfor someone else, and had been for some time. The simplest answer was\nthat he was still working for the person he’d served for years.”\n“Ah. Of course, you weren’t supposed know he caused the explosion.”\n“I wasn’t supposed to survive it, you mean.”\nLord Ladrian shrugged.\n“Why?” Waxillium asked, leaning in. “Why bring me back, if only to\nthen have me killed? Why not arrange for someone else to take the house\ntitle?”\n“Hinston was going to take it,” Lord Ladrian said, buttering a roll. “His\ndisease was … unfortunate. Plans were already in motion. I didn’t have\ntime to search out other options. Besides, I hoped—obviously, without basis\n—that you’d have overcome your overdeveloped childhood sense of\nmorality. I had hoped you’d be a resource to me.”\nRust and Ruin, I hate this man, Waxillium thought, memories of his\nchildhood returning to him. He’d gone to the Roughs, in part, to escape that\ncondescending voice.\n“I’ve come for the other four kidnapped women,” Waxillium said.\nLord Ladrian took a sip of wine. “You think I’m going to give them up,\njust like that?”\n“Yes. I will expose you, otherwise.”\n“Go right ahead!” Lord Ladrian seemed amused. “Some will believe you.\nOthers will think you mad. Neither reaction will hinder me or my\ncolleagues.”\n“Because you’ve already been defeated,” Waxillium said."

He laughed, lowering it to the\ntable. “Is that honestly what you think?”\n“The Vanishers are gone,” Waxillium said, “Miles is being executed as\nwe speak, and I know that you were funding him. We captured the goods\nyou were stealing, so you have gained nothing there. You obviously didn’t\nhave much in the way of funds to begin with. Otherwise you wouldn’t have\nneeded Miles and his team to do the robberies.”\n“I assure you, Waxillium, that we are quite solvent. Thank you. And\nyou’ll find no proof that I or my associates had anything to do with the\nrobberies. We rented Miles his space, but how could we have known what\nhe was up to? Harmony! He was a respected lawkeeper.”\n“You took the women.”\n“There is no proof of that. Just speculation on your part. A few of the\nVanishers will swear to their graves that Miles raped and killed the women.\nI know for a fact that one of those Vanishers survived. Though I am still\ncurious how you found me here, in this particular train.”\nWaxillium made no reply to that specifically. “I know that you’re\nruined,” he said instead. “Say what you will, I see it. Give me the women\nand my sister. I’ll recommend to the judges that you be shown leniency.\nYes, you funded a group of robbers as a means of high-stakes investment.\nBut you explicitly told them not to hurt anyone, and you weren’t the one to\npull the trigger and kill Peterus. I suspect you’ll escape execution.”\n“You assume so many things, Waxillium,” Lord Ladrian said. He reached\ninto the pocket of his jacket and removed a folded broadsheet and a thin,\nblack leather appointment book. He set them down on the table, broadsheet\non the top. “Funding a group of robbers as a means of high-stakes\ninvestment? Is that really what you think this was about?”\n“That and kidnapping the women,” Waxillium said. “Presumably as a\nmeans of extorting their families.”\nThat last part was a lie. Waxillium didn’t believe for a moment that it was\nabout extortion. His uncle was planning something, and considering the\nfamily lines of those women, Waxillium suspected that Marasi was right. It\nwas about Allomancy.\nHe harbored a hope that his uncle wasn’t involved in the direct …\nbreeding. The very idea made Waxillium uncomfortable. Perhaps Ladrian\nwas merely selling the women to someone else.\nWhat a thing to hope for.\nLadrian tapped the broadsheet. The headline was about news that was\ngoing around the city. House Tekiel was on the brink of collapse. They’d\nhad too much bad publicity in the robbery last week, even though the cargo\nhad been recovered. That, mixed with other serious financial troubles …\nOther serious financial troubles.\nWaxillium scanned the broadsheet. Tekiel’s main house business was\nsecurity. Insurance.

Rust and Ruin! he thought, making the connection.\n“A series of targeted attacks,” Ladrian said, leaning in, sounding pleased\nwith himself. “House Tekiel is doomed. They owe payments on too many\nhigh-profile losses. These attacks, and the insurance claims, have devastated\nthem and their financial integrity. Company shareholders have been selling\ntheir stakes for pennies. You claimed my finances were weak. That is only\nbecause they have been dedicated to a specific task. Have you wondered,\nyet, why your house is destitute?”\n“You took it all,” Waxillium guessed. “You funneled it out of the house\nfinances into … something. Somewhere.”\n“We have just seized one of the most powerful financial institutions in the\ncity,” Ladrian said. “The materials stolen are being returned, and so while\nwe’ve assumed Tekiel’s debts by purchasing them, the claims for lost goods\nwill soon be nullified. I always expected Miles to be captured. This plan\nwouldn’t work without it.”\nWaxillium closed his eyes, feeling a dread. I’ve been chasing chickens\nthis entire time, he realized. While someone stole the horses. It wasn’t about\nrobberies, or even kidnappings.\nIt was insurance fraud.\n“We needed only the temporary disappearance of goods,” Edwarn said.\n“And everything has worked out perfectly. Thank you.”\n* * *\nThe bullets ripped through Miles’s body. Marasi watched, holding her\nbreath, forcing herself not to wince. It was time to stop being a child.\nHe was shot again. Her eyes open, her nerves steeled, she was able to\nwatch with horror as his wounds started to heal. It should have been\nimpossible. They’d searched him carefully for metalminds. Yet the bullet\nholes pulled closed, and his smile widened, his eyes wild.\n“You are fools!” Miles yelled at the firing squad. “One day, the men of\ngold and red, bearers of the final metal, will come to you. And you will be\nruled by them.”\nThey fired again. More bullets ripped into Miles. The wounds again\nclosed, but not all the way. He didn’t have enough healing stored in\nwhatever last metalmind he had hidden. Marasi found herself shivering as a\nfourth volley struck his body, causing him to spasm.\n“Worship,” Miles said, his voice failing, his mouth spouting blood.\n“Worship Trell and wait…”\nThe fifth volley of bullets hit, and this time none of the wounds healed.\nMiles slackened in his bonds, eyes open and lifeless, staring at the ground\nbefore him.\nThe constables looked extremely disturbed. One of them ran up to check\nfor a pulse. Marasi shivered. Right up until the end, Miles hadn’t seemed\nlike he accepted death.\nBut he was dead now. A Bloodmaker like him could heal repeatedly, but\nif they ever actually stopped healing—let their wounds consume them—\nthey would die like anyone else. Just to make certain, the nearest constable\nraised a handgun and blasted Miles three times in the side of the head. This\nwas gruesome enough that Marasi had to look away.\nIt was done.

Your heritage alone should make you\nbetter than that.”\n“My heritage?”\n“You are of a noble bloodline,” Ladrian said. “Directly back to the\nCounselor of Gods himself. You are Twinborn, and a powerful Allomancer.\nIt was with great regret that I ordered your death, and I only did so under\npressure from my colleagues. I suspected, even hoped, you would survive.\nThis world needs you. Us.”\n“You sound like Miles,” Waxillium said, surprised.\n“No,” Ladrian said. “He sounded like me.” He tucked his handkerchief\ninto his collar, then began to dine. “But you are not ready. I will see that you\nare sent the proper information. For now, you may withdraw and consider\nwhat I’ve told you.”\n“I don’t think so,” Waxillium said, reaching into his jacket for a handgun.\nLadrian looked up with a pitying expression. Waxillium heard guns being\ncocked, and glanced to the side, to where several young men wearing black\nsuits stood in the corridor outside. None were wearing metal on their\nbodies.\n“I have nearly twenty Allomancers riding in this train, Waxillium,”\nEdwarn said, voice cold. “And you are wounded, barely able to walk. You\ndon’t have a sliver of evidence against me. Are you certain this is a fight\nyou want to start?”\nWaxillium hesitated. Then he growled and reached forward with an\nempty hand to sweep the meal off his uncle’s table. Dishes and food spilled\nto the floor with a crash as Waxillium bent forward, enraged. “I’ll kill you\nsomeday, Uncle.”\nEdwarn leaned back, unthreatened. “Lead him to the back of the train.\nThrow him off. Good day, Waxillium.”\nWaxillium tried to reach for his uncle, but the men rushed in and grabbed\nhim, pulling him away. His side and his leg both flared in pain at the\ntreatment. Edwarn was right about one thing. This wasn’t the day to fight.\nBut that day would come.\nWaxillium let them tow him down the hallway. They opened the door at\nthe end of the train and tossed him out toward the tracks that sped by\nbeneath.

She felt\nsomething stirring in her, a powerful curiosity she could not describe.

She ran after it, holding her handbag in a tight grip and reaching\ninside for the small revolver Waxillium had given her.\nWhat am I doing? a part of her mind thought. Running into an alleyway\nalone? It wasn’t a particularly sensible thing to do. She just felt that she had\nto do it.\nShe ran a short distance. Had she lost the figure? She paused at an\nintersection, where an even smaller alleyway cut off from the first. Her\ncuriosity was almost unbearable.\nStanding in the mouth of the smaller alleyway, waiting for her, was a tall\nman in a black robe.\nShe gasped, stepping backward. The man was well over six feet tall, and\nthe enveloping robe gave him an ominous appearance. He brought up pale\nhands and took down his hood, exposing a shaved head and a face that was\ntattooed around the eyes in an intricate pattern.\nDriven into those eyes, point-first, were what looked like a pair of thick\nrailroad spikes. One of the eye sockets was deformed, as if it had been\ncrushed, long-healed scars and bony ridges under the skin marring the\ntattoos.\nMarasi knew this creature from mythology, but seeing him left her cold,\nterrified. “Ironeyes,” she whispered.\n“I apologize for bringing you like this,” Ironeyes said. He had a quiet,\ngravelly voice.\n“Like this?” she said, her voice coming out as almost a squeak.\n“With emotional Allomancy. I sometimes Pull too hard. I’ve never been\nas good at this sort of thing as Breeze was. Be calm, child. I will not hurt\nyou.”\nShe felt an instant calmness, though that felt terribly unnatural, and left\nher feeling even worse. Calm, but sick. One should not be calm when\nspeaking with Death himself.\n“Your friend,” Ironeyes said, “has uncovered something very dangerous.”\n“And you wish him to stop?”\n“Stop?” Ironeyes said. “Not at all. I wish him to be informed. Harmony\nhas particular views about how things must be done. I do not always agree\nwith him. Oddly, his particular beliefs require that he allow that. Here.”\nIroneyes reached into the folds of his cloak, bringing out a small book.\n“There is information in this. Guard it carefully. You may read it, if you\nwish, but deliver it to Lord Waxillium on my behalf.”\nShe took the book. “Pardon,” she said, trying to fight through the\nnumbness he had put inside her. Was she really speaking to a mythological\nfigure? Was she going mad? She could barely think. “But why didn’t you\ntake it to him yourself?”\nIroneyes responded with a tight-lipped smile, watching her with the\nheads of those silvery spikes. “I have a feeling he’d have tried to shoot me.\nThat one does not like unanswered questions, but he does my brother’s"

Landing still hurt his leg.\nWayne sat on the platform, feet up on a barrel, smoking his pipe. He still\nhad his arm in a sling. He wouldn’t be able to heal it quickly—he had no\nhealth stored up. Trying to store some now would just make him heal more\nslowly during that process, then heal more quickly as he tapped his\nmetalmind, ending with no net gain.\nWayne was reading a small novel that he’d picked out of someone’s\npocket on their train ride out to the estates. He’d left an aluminum bullet in\nits place, worth easily a hundred times the price of the book. Ironically, the\nperson who found it would probably throw it away, never realizing its\nvalue.\nI’ll need to talk to him about that again, Waxillium thought, walking up\nonto the platform. But not today. Today, they had other worries.\nWaxillium joined his friend, but continued staring to the south. Toward\nthe city, and his uncle.\n“It’s a pretty good book,” Wayne said, flipping a page. “You should try it.\nIt’s about bunnies. They talk. Damnedest thing ever.”\nWaxillium didn’t reply.\n“So, was it your uncle?” Wayne asked.\n“Yes.”\n“Crud. I owe you a fiver, then.”\n“The bet was for twenty.”\n“Yeah, but you owe me fifteen.”\n“I do?”\n“Sure, for that bet I made that you’d end up helpin’ me with the\nVanishers.”\nWaxillium frowned, looking at his friend. “I don’t remember that bet.”\n“You weren’t there when we made it.”\n“I wasn’t there?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Wayne, you can’t make bets with people when they aren’t there.”\n“I can,” Wayne said, tucking the book into his pocket and standing, “if\nthey shoulda been there. And you shoulda, Wax.”\n“I…” How to respond to that? “I will be. From now on.”\nWayne nodded, joining him and looking toward Elendel. It rose in the\ndistance, the two competing skyscrapers rising on one side of the city, other\nsmaller ones growing like crystals from the center of the expanding\nmetropolis.\n“You know,” Wayne said, “I always wondered what it would be like to\ncome here, find civilization and all that. I didn’t realize.”\n“Realize what?” Waxillium asked.\n“That this was really the rough part of the world,” Wayne said. “That we\nhad it easy, out past the mountains.”"

Somma\nthe time, at least.”\n“And the rest of the time?”\n“The rest of the time, I don’t do so much thinkin’. ’Cuz if I did, I’d go\nrunnin’ back to where things is simple. You see?”\n“I see. And we do have to stay, Wayne. I have work to do here.”\n“Then we’ll see it done,” Wayne said. “Just like always.”\nWaxillium nodded, reaching into his sleeve and sliding out a thin black\nbook.\n“What’s that?” Wayne asked, taking it, curious.\n“My uncle’s pocket book,” Waxillium said. “Filled with appointments\nand notes.”\nWayne whistled softly. “How’d you take it? Shoulder bump?”\n“Table sweep,” Waxillium said.\n“Nice. Glad to know I’ve taught you somethin’ useful during our years\ntogether. What did you trade for it?”\n“A threat,” Waxillium said, looking back toward Elendel. “And a\npromise.”\nHe would see this to the end. Roughs honor.

Mistings who can burn aluminum are called Aluminum Gnats\ndue to the ineffectiveness of this ability by itself. Trueself Ferrings can\nstore their spiritual sense of identity in an aluminum metalmind. This is\nan art rarely spoken of outside of Terris communities, and even among\nthem, it is not yet well understood. Aluminum itself and a few of its\nalloys are Allomantically inert; they cannot be Pushed or Pulled and can\nbe used to shield an individual from emotional Allomancy.\nBENDALLOY: Slider Mistings burn bendalloy to compress time in a bubble\naround themselves, making it pass more quickly within the bubble. This\ncauses events outside the bubble to move at a glacial pace from the point\nof view of the Slider. Subsumer Ferrings can store nutrition and calories\nin a bendalloy metalmind; they can eat large amounts of food during\nactive storage without feeling full or gaining weight, and then can go\nwithout the need to eat while tapping the metalmind. A separate\nbendalloy metalmind can be used to similarly regulate fluids intake.\nBRASS: Soother Mistings burn brass to soothe (dampen) the emotions of\nnearby individuals. This can be directed at a single individual or directed\nacross a general area, and the Soother can focus on specific emotions.\nFiresoul Ferrings can store warmth in a brass metalmind, cooling\nthemselves off while actively storing. They can tap the metalmind at a\nlater time to warm themselves."

They can tap the metalmind at a\nlater time to warm themselves.\nBRONZE: Seeker Mistings burn brass to “hear” pulses given off by other\nAllomancers who are burning metals. Different metals produce different\npulses. Sentry Ferrings can store wakefulness in a bronze metalmind,\nmaking themselves drowsy while actively storing. They can tap the\nmetalmind at a later time to reduce drowsiness or to heighten their\nawareness.\nCADMIUM: Pulser Mistings burn cadmium to stretch time in a bubble around\nthemselves, making it pass more slowly inside the bubble. This causes\nevents outside the bubble to move at blurring speed from the point of\nview of the Pulser. Gasper Ferrings can store breath inside a cadmium\nmetalmind; during active storage they must hyperventilate in order for\ntheir bodies to get enough air. The breath can be retrieved at a later time,\neliminating or reducing the need to breathe using the lungs while tapping\nthe metalmind. They can also highly oxygenate their blood.\nCHROMIUM: Leecher Mistings who burn chromium while touching another\nAllomancer will wipe that Allomancer’s metal reserves. Spinner Ferrings\ncan store fortune in a chromium metalmind, making themselves unlucky\nduring active storage, and can tap it at a later time to increase their luck.\nCOPPER: Coppercloud Mistings (also known as Smokers) burn copper to\ncreate an invisible cloud around themselves, which hides nearby\nAllomancers from being detected by a Seeker and which shields nearby\nindividuals from the effects of emotional Allomancy. Archivist Ferrings\ncan store memories in a copper metalmind (coppermind); the memory is\ngone from their head while in storage, and can be retrieved with perfect\nrecall at a later time.\nDURALUMIN: A Mistborn who burns duralumin instantly burns away any\nother metals being burned at the time, releasing an enormous burst of\nthose metals’ power. Mistings who can burn Duralumin are called\nDuralumin Gnats due to the ineffectiveness of this ability by itself.\nConnecter Ferrings can store spiritual connection in a duralumin\nmetalmind, reducing other people’s awareness and friendship with them\nduring active storage, and can tap it at a later time in order to speedily\nform trust relationships with others.\nELECTRUM: Oracle Mistings burn electrum to see a vision of possible paths\ntheir future could take. This is usually limited to a few seconds. Pinnacle\nFerrings can store determination in an electrum metalmind, entering a\ndepressed state during active storage, and can tap it at a later time to enter\na manic phase.\nGOLD: Augur Mistings burn gold to see a vision of a past self or how they\nwould have turned out having made different choices in the past.\nBloodmaker Ferrings can store health in a gold metalmind, reducing their\nhealth while actively storing, and can tap it at a later time in order to heal\nquickly or to heal beyond the body’s usual abilities.\nIRON: Lurcher Mistings who burn iron can Pull on nearby sources of metal.\nPulls must be directly toward the Lurcher’s center of gravity.

Skimmer\nFerrings can store physical weight in an iron metalmind, reducing their\neffective weight while actively storing, and can tap it at a later time to\nincrease their effective weight.\nNICROSIL: Nicroburst Mistings who burn nicrosil while touching another\nAllomancer will instantly burn away any metals being burned by that\nAllomancer, releasing an enormous (and perhaps unexpected) burst of\nthose metals’ power within that Allomancer. Soulbearer Ferrings can\nstore Investiture in a nicrosil metalmind. This is a power that very few\nknow anything about; indeed, I’m certain the people of Terris don’t truly\nknow what they are doing when they use these powers.\nPEWTER: Pewterarm Mistings (also known as Thugs) burn pewter to increase\ntheir physical strength, speed, and durability, also enhancing their bodies’\nability to heal. Brute Ferrings can store physical strength in a pewter\nmetalmind, reducing their strength while actively storing, and can tap it\nat a later time to increase their strength.\nSTEEL: Coinshot Mistings who burn steel can Push on nearby sources of\nmetal. Pushes must be directly away from the Coinshot’s center of\ngravity. Steelrunner Ferrings can store physical speed in a steel\nmetalmind, slowing them while actively storing, and can tap it at a later\ntime to increase their speed.\nTIN: Tineye Mistings who burn tin increase the sensitivity of their five\nsenses. All are increased at the same time. Windwhisperer Ferrings can\nstore the sensitivity of one of the five senses in a tin metalmind; a\ndifferent tin metalmind must be used for each sense. While storing, their\nsensitivity in that sense is reduced, and when the metalmind is tapped\nthat sense is enhanced.\nZINC: Rioter Mistings burn zinc to riot (enflame) the emotions of nearby\nindividuals. This can be directed at a single individual or directed across\na general area, and the Rioter can focus on specific emotions. Sparker\nFerrings can store mental speed in a zinc metalmind, dulling their ability\nto think and reason while actively storing, and can tap it at a later time to\nthink and reason more quickly.\nON THE THREE METALLIC ARTS\nOn Scadrial, there are three prime manifestations of Investiture. Locally,\nthese are spoken of as the “Metallic Arts,” though there are other names for\nthem.\nAllomancy is the most common of the three. It is end-positive, according\nto my terminology, meaning that the practitioner draws in power from an\nexternal source. The body then filters it into various forms. (The actual\noutlet of the power is not chosen by the practitioner, but instead is\nhardwritten into their Spiritweb.) The key to drawing this power comes in\nthe form of various types of metals, with specific compositions being\nrequired. Though the metal is consumed in the process, the power itself\ndoesn’t actually come from the metal. The metal is a catalyst, you might\nsay, that begins an Investiture and keeps it running.\nIn truth, this isn’t much different from the form-based Investitures one"

The metal is a catalyst, you might\nsay, that begins an Investiture and keeps it running.\nIn truth, this isn’t much different from the form-based Investitures one\nfinds on Sel, where specific shape is the key—here, however, the\ninteractions are more limited. Still, one cannot deny the raw power of\nAllomancy. It is instinctive and intuitive for the practitioner, as opposed to\nrequiring a great deal of study and exactness, as one finds in the form-based\nInvestitures of Sel.\nAllomancy is brutal, raw, and powerful. There are sixteen base metals\nthat work, though two others—named the God Metals locally—can be used\nin alloy to craft an entirely different set of sixteen each. As these God\nMetals are no longer commonly available, however, the other metals are not\nin wide use.\nFeruchemy is still widely known and used at this point in Scadrial.\nIndeed, you might say that it is more present today than it has been in many\neras past, when it was confined to distant Terris or hidden from sight by the\nKeepers.\nFeruchemy is an end-neutral art, meaning that power is neither gained\nnor lost. The art also requires metal as a focus, but instead of being\nconsumed, the metal acts as a medium by which abilities within the\npractitioner are shuttled through time. Invest that metal on one day,\nwithdraw the power on another day. It is a well-rounded art, with some\nfeelers in the Physical, some in the Cognitive, and even some in the\nSpiritual. The last powers are under heavy experimentation by the Terris\ncommunity, and aren’t spoken of to outsiders.\nIt should be noted that the inbreeding of the Feruchemists with the\ngeneral population has diluted the power in some ways. It is now common\nfor people to be born with access to only one of the sixteen Feruchemical\nabilities. It is hypothesized that if one could make metalminds out of alloys\nwith the God Metals, other abilities could be discovered.\nHemalurgy is widely unknown in the modern world of Scadrial. Its\nsecrets were kept close by those who survived their world’s rebirth, and the\nonly known practitioners of it now are the kandra, who (for the most part)\nserve Harmony.\nHemalurgy is an end-negative art. Some power is lost in the practice of it.\nThough many through history have maligned it as an “evil” art, none of the\nInvestitures are actually evil. At its core, Hemalurgy deals with removing\nabilities—or attributes—from one person and bestowing them on another. It\nis primarily concerned with things of the Spiritual realm, and is of the\ngreatest interest to me. If one of these three arts is of great interest to the\nCosmere, it is this one. I think there are great possibilities for its use.\nTOR BOOKS BY BRANDON SANDERSON\nTHE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE\nThe Way of Kings\nWarbreaker\nTHE MISTBORN TRILOGY\nMistborn\nThe Well of Ascension\nThe Hero of Ages\nElantris\nThis is a work of fiction.
