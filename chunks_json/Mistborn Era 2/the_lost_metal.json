I’d seen\nmashups of fantasy and science fiction before, and I’d seen epic fantasy\ninch toward industrial technology. But I’d never seen an author develop a\nworld in quite this way—giving an expansive view of a planet moving into\nthe future, using the lore of earlier book series as the foundation of religion\nand myth.\nIt was a gamble. Readers tend to like their genres well delineated. Here,\nI was pitching something that broke apart those genre lines in ways that\nhistorically did not sell well. Yet I was convinced that the larger-scale\nproject (the vision of a planet and its magic throughout various eras) was\nworth the risk. That brings us here, to the final book of Era Two of Mistborn\nand my grand experiment with genre.\nWhether I’ve been successful or not so far is up to you, the reader. But I\ncan say this: I certainly wouldn’t have gotten where I am without the help\nof a large number of people. I know these acknowledgments are a bit of a\nblur of names, but I’m so grateful to each and every one of them. These are\nthe people who, when I come up with some new audacious plan, don’t roll\ntheir eyes—they instead roll up their sleeves and make it happen.\nFor this book, Joshua Bilmes did his usual excellent job as my agent. On\nhis team, Susan Velazquez and Christina Zobel were also a great deal of\nhelp, managing all the different overseas contracts and subagents.\nSpeaking of across the pond, I had some extra-special help from Gillian\nRedfearn on this book—she’s my UK editor, and took the lead on this book\nperforming the line edit work that often is shouldered by the US publisher.\nShe did a fantastic job, and I’m lucky to have her help. In addition, I’d like\nto thank Emad Akhtar and Brendan Durkin at Gollancz in the UK, as well\nas my UK agents, John Berlyne and Stevie Finegan at the Zeno Agency."

And, of course, to the readers.\nMistborn has been a strange journey these last sixteen years, and I feel it’s\nabout to get even stranger—as well as (with a little luck) even more\nincredible.\nPROLOGUE\nWayne knew about beds. Other kids in Tinweight Settlement had them. A\nbed sounded much better than a mat on the ground—especially one he had\nto share with his ma when the nights were cold, because they didn’t have\nany coal.\nPlus there were monsters under beds.\nYeah, he’d heard stories of mistwraiths. They’d hide unner your bed and\nsteal the faces of people you knew. Which made beds soft and squishy on\ntop, with someone underneath you could talk to. Sounded like rustin’\nheaven.\nOther kids were scared of mistwraiths, but Wayne figured they just\ndidn’t know how to negotiate properly. He could make friends with\nsomething what lived unner a bed. You just had to give it something it\nwanted, like someone else to eat.\nAnyway, no bed for him. And no proper chairs. They had a table, built\nby Uncle Gregr. Back before he got crushed by a billion rocks in a landslide\nand mushed into a pulp what couldn’t hit people no more. Wayne kicked the\ntable sometimes, in case Gregr’s spirit was watching and was fond of it.\nRusts knew there was nothing else in this one-window home Uncle Gregr\nhad cared about.\nBest Wayne had was a stool, so he sat on that and played with his cards\n—dealing hands and hiding cards up his sleeve—as he waited. This was a\nnervous time of day. Every evening he feared she wouldn’t come home. Not\nbecause she didn’t love him. Ma was a burst of sweet spring flowers in a\nsewage pit of a world. But because one day Pa hadn’t come home. One day\nUncle Gregr—Wayne kicked the table—hadn’t come home. So Ma …\nDon’t think about it, Wayne thought, bungling his shuffle and spilling\ncards over the table and floor. And don’t look. Not until you see the light.\nHe could feel the mine out there; nobody wanted to live nexta it, so\nWayne and his ma did.\nHe thought of something else, on purpose. The pile of laundry by the\nwall that he’d finished washing earlier. That had been Ma’s old job what\ndidn’t pay well enough. Now he did it while she pushed minecarts.\nWayne didn’t mind the work. Got to try on all the different clothes—\nwhether they were from old gramps or young women—and pretend to be\nthem. His ma had caught him a few times and grown angry. Her\nexasperation still baffled him. Why wouldn’t you try them all on? That’s\nwhat clothes was for. It wasn’t nothing weird.\nBesides, sometimes folks left stuff in their pockets. Like decks of cards.\nHe fumbled the shuffle again, and as he gathered the cards up he did not\nlook out the window, even though he could feel the mine. That gaping"

Like decks of cards.\nHe fumbled the shuffle again, and as he gathered the cards up he did not\nlook out the window, even though he could feel the mine. That gaping\nartery, like the hole in someone’s neck, red from the inside and spurting out\nlight like blood and fire. His ma had to go dig at the beast’s insides,\nsearchin’ for metals, then escape its anger. You could only get lucky so\nmany times.\nThen he spotted it. Light. With relief, he glanced out the window and\nsaw someone walking along the path, holding up a lantern to illuminate her\nway. Wayne scrambled to hide the cards under the mat, then lay on top,\nfeigning sleep when the door opened. She’d have seen his light go out of\ncourse, but she appreciated the effort he put into pretending.\nShe settled on the stool, and Wayne cracked an eye. His ma wore\ntrousers and a buttoned shirt, her hair up, her clothing and face smudged.\nShe sat staring at the flame in the lantern, watching it flicker and dance, and\nher face seemed more hollow than it had been before. Like someone was\ntaking a pickaxe to her cheeks.\nThat mine’s eatin’ her away, he thought. It hasn’t gobbled her up like it\ndid Pa, but it’s gnawing on her.\nMa blinked, then fixated on something else. A card he’d left on the table.\nAw, hell.\nShe picked it up, then looked right at him. He didn’t pretend to be asleep\nno more. She’d dump water on him.\n“Wayne,” she said, “where did you get these cards?”\n“Don’t remember.”\n“Wayne…”\n“Found ’em,” he said.\nShe held out her hand, and he reluctantly pulled the deck out and handed\nit over. She tucked the card she’d found into the box. Damn. She’d spend a\nday searching Tinweight for whoever had “lost” them. Well, he wouldn’t\nhave her losing more sleep on account of him.\n“Tark Vestingdow,” Wayne mumbled. “They was inna pocket of his\noveralls.”\n“Thank you,” she said softly.\n“Ma, I’ve gotta learn cards. That way I can earn a good livin’ and care\nfor us.”\n“A good living?” she asked. “With cards?”\n“Don’t worry,” he said quickly. “I’ll cheat! Can’t make a livin’ if you\ndon’t win, see.”\nShe sighed, rubbing her temples.\nWayne glanced at the cards in their stack. “Tark,” he said. “He’s Terris.\nLike Pa was.”\n“Yes.”\n“Terris people always do what they’re told. So what’s wrong with me?”\n“Nothing’s wrong with you, love,” she said. “You just haven’t got a\ngood parent to guide you.”\n“Ma,” he said, scrambling off the mat to take her arm. “Don’t talk like\nthat. You’re a great ma.”\nShe hugged him to her side, but he could feel her tension. “Wayne,” she\nasked, “did you take Demmy’s pocketknife?”\n“He talked?” Wayne said. “Rust that rustin’ bastard!”\n“Wayne! Don’t swear like that.”"

Don’t swear like that.”\n“Rust that rusting bastard!” he said in a railworker’s accent instead.\nHe grinned at her innocently, and was rewarded with a smile she\ncouldn’t hide. Silly voices always made her happy. Pa had been good at\nthem, but Wayne was better. Particularly now that Pa was dead and couldn’t\nsay them no more.\nBut then her smile faded. “You can’t take things what don’t belong to\nyou, Wayne. That’s somethin’ thieves do.”\n“I don’t wanna be a thief,” Wayne said softly, putting the pocketknife on\nthe table beside the cards. “I want to be a good boy. It just … happens.”\nShe hugged him closer. “You are a good boy. You’ve always been a\ngood boy.”\nWhen she said it, he believed it.\n“Do you want a story, love?” she asked.\n“I’m too old for stories,” he lied, desperately wishing she’d tell one\nanyway. “I’m eleven. One more year and I can drink at the tavern.”\n“What? Who told you that!”\n“Dug.”\n“Dug is nine.”\n“Dug knows stuff.”\n“Dug is nine.”\n“So you’re sayin’ I’ll have to snitch booze for him next year, ’cuz he\ncan’t get it himself yet?” He met her eyes, then started snickering.\nHe helped her get dinner—cold oatmeal with some beans in it. At least it\nwasn’t only beans. Then he snuggled into his blankets on the mat,\npretending he was a child again to listen. It was easy to feign that. He still\nhad the clothes after all.\n“This is the tale,” she said, “of Blatant Barm, the Unwashed Bandit.”\n“Oooh…” Wayne said. “A new one?”\nHis mother leaned forward, wagging her spoon toward him as she\nspoke. “He was the worst of them all, Wayne. Baddest, meanest, stinkiest\nbandit. He never bathed.”\n“’Cuz it takes too much work to get properly dirty?”\n“No, because he … Wait, it’s work to get dirty?”\n“Gotta roll around in it, you see.”\n“Why in Harmony’s name would you do that?”\n“To think like the ground,” Wayne said.\n“To…” She smiled. “Oh, Wayne. You’re so precious.”\n“Thanks,” he said. “Why ain’t you told me of this Blatant Barm before?\nIf he was so bad wouldn’t he be the first one you told stories about?”\n“You were too young,” she said, sitting back. “And the story too\nfrightening.”\nOoooh … This was going to be a good one. Wayne bounced up and\ndown. “Who got ’im? Was it a lawman?”\n“It was Allomancer Jak.”\n“Him?” Wayne said with a groan.\n“I thought you liked him.”\nWell, all the kids did.

Least according to Dug.\n“But Jak always brings the bad guys in,” Wayne complained. “He never\nshoots a single one.”\n“Not this time,” Ma said, digging into her oatmeal. “He knew Blatant\nBarm was the worst. Killer to the core. Even Barm’s sidekicks—Gud the\nKiller and Noways Joe—were ten times worse than any other bandit that\never walked the Roughs.”\n“Ten times?” Wayne said.\n“Yup.”\n“That’s a lot! Almost double!”\nHis ma frowned for a moment, but then leaned forward again. “They’d\nrobbed the payroll. Taking not just the money from the fat men in Elendel,\nbut the wages of the common folk.”\n“Bastards!” Wayne said.\n“Wayne!”\n“Fine! Regular old turds then!”\nAgain she hesitated. “Do you … know what the word ‘bastard’ means?”\n“It’s a bad turd, the kind you get when you’ve really got to go, but you\nhold it in too long.”\n“You know that because…”\n“Dug told me.”\n“Of course he did. Well, Jak, he wouldn’t stand for stealing from the\ncommon folk of the Roughs. Being a bandit is one thing, but everyone\nknows you take the money what goes toward the city.\n“Unfortunately, Blatant Barm, he knew the area real well. So he rode off\ninto the most difficult land in the Roughs—and he left one of his two\nsidekicks to guard each of the key spots along the way. Fortunately, Jak was\nthe bravest of men. And the strongest.”\n“If he was the bravest and strongest,” Wayne said, “why was he a\nlawman? He could be a bandit, and nobody could stop him!”\n“What’s harder, love?” she asked. “Doing what’s right or doing what’s\nwrong?”\n“Doing what’s right.”\n“So who gets stronger?” Ma asked. “The fellow what does the easy\nthing, or what does the hard thing?”\nHuh. He nodded. Yeah. Yeah, he could see that.\nShe moved the lantern closer to her face, making it shine as she spoke.\n“Jak’s first test was the River Human, the vast waterway marking the border\nwith what had once been koloss lands. The waters moved at the speed of a\ntrain; it was the fastest river in the whole world—and it was full of rocks.\nGud the Killer had set up there, across the river, to watch for lawmen. He\nhad such a good eye and steady hand that he could shoot a fly off a man at\nthree hundred paces.”\n“Why’d you want to do that?” Wayne asked. “Better to shoot ’im right\nin the fly. That’s gotta hurt something bad.”\n“Not that kind of fly, love,” Ma said.\n“So what did Jak do?” Wayne asked. “Did he sneak up? Not very\nlawman-like to sneak. I don’t think they do that. I’ll bet he didn’t sneak.”\n“Well…” Ma said.\nWayne clutched his blanket, waiting.\n“Jak was a better shot,” she whispered. “When Gud the Killer sighted"

Right, Ma!”\n“Yup.”\n“And his head exploded,” Wayne said, “like a fruit—the crunchy kind,\nthe shell all tough but it’s gooey inside. Is that how it happened?”\n“Absolutely.”\n“Dang, Ma,” Wayne said. “That’s gruesome. You sure you should be\ntellin’ me this story?”\n“Should I stop?”\n“Hell no! How’d Jak get across the water?”\n“He flew,” Ma said. She set her bowl aside, oatmeal finished, and gave a\nflourish with both hands. “Using his Allomantic powers. Jak can fly, and\ntalk to birds, and eat rocks.”\n“Wow. Eat rocks?”\n“Yup. And so he flew over that river. But the next challenge was even\nworse. The Canyon of Death.”\n“Ooooh…” Wayne said. “Bet that place was pretty.”\n“Why do you say that?”\n“’Cuz nobody’s going to visit a place called ‘Canyon of Death’ unless\nit’s pretty. But somebody visited it, ’cuz we know the name. So it must be\npretty.”\n“Beautiful,” Ma said. “A canyon carved through the middle of a bunch\nof crumbling rock spires—the broken peaks streaked with colors, like they\nwas painted that way. But the place was as deadly as it was beautiful.”\n“Yeah,” Wayne said. “Figures.”\n“Jak couldn’t fly over this one, for the second of the bandits hid in the\ncanyon. Noways Joe. He was a master of pistols, and could also fly, and\nturn into a dragon, and eat rocks. If Jak tried to sneak past, Joe would shoot\nhim from behind.”\n“That’s the smart way to shoot someone,” Wayne said. “On account of\nthem not bein’ able to shoot back.”\n“True,” Ma said. “So Jak didn’t let that happen. He had to go into the\ncanyon—but it was filled with snakes.”\n“Bloody hell!”\n“Wayne…”\n“Regular old boring hell, then! How many snakes?”\n“A million snakes.”\n“Bloody hell!”\n“But Jak, he was smart,” Ma said. “So he’d thought to bring some snake\nfood.”\n“A million bits of snake food?”\n“Nah, only one,” she said. “But he got the snakes to fight over it, so they\nmostly killed each other. And the one what was left was the strongest,\nnaturally.”\n“Naturally.”\n“So Jak talked it into biting Noways Joe.”\n“And so Joe turned purple!” Wayne said. “And bled out his ears! And\nhis bones melted, so the melty bone juice leaked out of his nose! And he\ncollapsed into a puddle of deflated skin, all while hissing and blubbering\n’cuz his teeth was melting!”\n“Exactly.”"

You tell the best stories.”\n“It gets better,” she said softly, leaning down on the stool, their lantern\nburning low. “Because the ending has a surprise.”\n“What surprise?”\n“Once Jak was through the canyon—what now smelled like dead snakes\nand melted bones—he spotted the final challenge: the Lone Mesa. A giant\nplateau in the center of an otherwise flat plain.”\n“That’s not much of a challenge,” Wayne said. “He could fly to the top.”\n“Well he tried to,” she whispered. “But the mesa was Blatant Barm.”\n“WHAT?”\n“That’s right,” Ma said. “Barm had joined up with the koloss—the ones\nthat change into big monsters, not the normal ones like old Mrs. Nock. And\nthey showed him how to turn into a monster of humongous size. So when\nJak tried to land on it, the mesa done gobbled him up.”\nWayne gasped. “And then,” he said, “it mashed him beneath its teeth,\ncrushing his bones like—”\n“No,” Ma said. “It tried to swallow him. But Jak, he wasn’t only smart\nand a good shot. He was something else.”\n“What?”\n“A big damn pain in the ass.”\n“Ma! That’s swearin’.”\n“It’s okay in stories,” Ma said. “Listen, Jak was a pain. He was always\ngoing about doing good. Helping people. Making life tough for bad people.\nAsking questions. He knew exactly how to ruin a bandit’s day.\n“So as he was swallowed, Jak stretched out his arms and legs, then\npushed—making himself a lump in Blatant Barm’s throat, so the monster\ncouldn’t breathe. Monsters like that needs lotsa air, you know. And so,\nAllomancer Jak done choked Barm from the inside. Then, when the monster\nwas dead on the ground, Jak sauntered out down its tongue—like it was\nsome fancy mat set outside a carriage for a rich man.”\nWhoa. “That’s a good story, Ma.”\nShe smiled.\n“Ma,” he said. “Is the story … about the mine?”\n“Well,” she said, “I suppose we all gotta walk into the beast’s mouth\nnow and then. So … maybe, I guess.”\n“You’re like the lawman then.”\n“Anyone can be,” she said, blowing out the lantern.\n“Even me?”\n“Especially you.” She kissed him on the forehead. “You are whatever\nyou want to be, Wayne. You’re the wind. You’re the stars. You are all\nendless things.”\nIt was a poem she liked. He liked it too. Because when she said it, he\nbelieved her. How could he not? Ma didn’t lie. So, he snuggled deeper into\nhis blankets and let himself drift off. A lot was wrong in the world, but a\nfew things were right. And as long as she was around, stories meant\nsomething.

The stench was incredible, of course. But worse was the\nway her booted feet would occasionally slip for a heart-stopping moment,\nthreatening to plunge her down into the “mud” underneath.\nAt least she’d had the foresight to wear a uniform with trousers today,\nalong with knee-high leather work boots. But there was no protection from\nthe scent, the feel, or—unfortunately—the sound of it. When she took a step\n—map in one hand, rifle in the other—each boot would pull free with a\nsquelch of mythical proportions. It would have been the worst sound ever, if\nnot overmatched by Wayne’s complaining.\n“Wax never brought me into a rusting sewer,” he muttered, raising the\nlantern.\n“Are there sewers in the Roughs?”\n“Well, no,” he admitted. “Pastures smell almost as bad, and he did make\nme march through those. But Marasi, they didn’t have spiders.”\n“They probably did,” she said, angling the map toward his lantern. “You\njust couldn’t see them.”\n“Suppose,” he grumbled. “But it’s worse when you can see the webs.\nAlso there’s, you know, the literal sewage.”\nMarasi nodded to a side tunnel and they started in that direction. “Do\nyou want to talk about it?”\n“What?” he demanded.\n“Your mood.”\n“Nothing’s wrong with my rusting mood,” he said. “It’s precisely the\nmood you’re supposed to have when your partner forces you to stick your\nfrontside into a buncha stuff that comes out of your backside.”\n“And last week?” she asked. “When we were investigating a perfume\nshop?”\n“Rusting perfumers,” Wayne said, his eyes narrowing. “Never can tell\nwhat they’re hiding with those fancy smells. You can’t trust a man what\ndoesn’t smell like a man should.”\n“Sweat and booze?”\n“Sweat and cheap booze.”\n“Wayne, how can you complain about someone putting on airs? You put\non a different personality every time you change hats.”\n“Does my smell change?”\n“I suppose not.”\n“Argument won. There are literally no holes in it whatsoever.\nConversation over.”\nThey shared a look.\n“I should get me some perfumes, eh?” Wayne said. “Someone might\nspot my disguises if I always smell like sweat and cheap booze.”\n“You’re hopeless.”\n“What’s hopeless,” he said, “is my poor shoes.”\n“Could have worn boots like I suggested.”\n“Ain’t got no boots,” he said. “Wax stole them.”\n“Wax stole your boots. Really.”\n“Well, they’re in his closet,” Wayne said. “Instead of three pairs of his\nposhest shoes. Which somehow ended up in my closet, completely by\nhappenstance.” He glanced at her. “It was a fair trade. I liked those boots.”\nMarasi smiled. They’d been working together for almost six years now,\nsince Wax’s retirement following the discovery of the Bands of Mourning."

They’d been working together for almost six years now,\nsince Wax’s retirement following the discovery of the Bands of Mourning.\nWayne was an official constable, not some barely-within-the-law deputized\ncitizen. He even wore a uniform once in a while. And—\n—and Marasi’s boot slipped again. Rusting hell. If she fell, he would\nnever stop laughing. But this did seem the best way. Construction on the\ncitywide underground train tunnels was ongoing, and two days ago a\ndemolitions man had filed a curious report. He didn’t want to blast the next\nsection, as seismic readings indicated they were near an unmapped cavern.\nThis area underneath the city of Elendel was peppered with ancient\ncaves. And it was the same region where a local group of gang enforcers\nkept vanishing and reappearing. As if they had a hidden entrance into an\nunknown, unseen lair.\nShe consulted the map, marked with the construction notes—and older\nannotations indicating a nearby oddity that the sewer builders had found\nyears ago, but which had never been properly investigated.\n“I think MeLaan is going to break up with me,” Wayne said softly.\n“That’s why maybe I’ve been uncharacteristically downbeat in my general\ndisposition as of late.”\n“What makes you think she’s going to do that?”\n“On account of her tellin’ me, ‘Wayne, I’m probably going to break up\nwith you in a few weeks.’”\n“Well, that’s polite of her.”\n“I think she’s got a new job from the big guy,” Wayne said. “But it ain’t\nright, how slow it’s goin’. ’S not the proper way to break up with a fellow.”\n“And what is the proper way?”\n“Throw something at his head,” Wayne said. “Sell his stuff. Tell his\nmates he’s a knob.”\n“You have had some interesting relationships.”\n“Nah, just mostly bad ones,” he said. “I asked Jammi Walls what she\nthought I should do— You know her? She’s at the tavern most nights.”\n“I know her,” Marasi said. “She’s a woman of … ill repute.”\n“What?” Wayne said. “Who’s been saying that? Jammi has a great repu-\ntation. Of all the whores on the block, she gives the best—”\n“I do not need to hear the next part. Thank you.”\n“Ill repute,” he said, chuckling. “I’m gonna tell Jammi you said that,\nMarasi. She worked hard for her reputation. Gets to charge four times what\nanyone else does! Ill repute indeed.”\n“And what did she say?”\n“She said MeLaan wanted me to try harder in the relationship,” Wayne\nsaid. “But I think in this case Jammi was wrong. Because MeLaan don’t\nplay games. When she says things, she means them. So it’s … you know…”\n“I’m sorry, Wayne,” Marasi said, tucking the map under her arm and\nresting her hand on his shoulder.\n“I knew it couldn’t last,” he said. “Rustin’ knew it, you know? She’s\nlike, what, a thousand years old?”\n“Roughly two-thirds that,” Marasi said.\n“And I’m not quite forty,” Wayne said. “More like sixteen if you take"

Maybe I belong in a sewer, you know?”\n“You don’t,” she said. “You’re the best partner I’ve ever had.”\n“Only partner.”\n“Only? Gorglen doesn’t count?”\n“Nope. He’s not human. I gots papers what prove he’s a giraffe in\ndisguise.” Then he smiled. “But … thanks for askin’. Thanks for carin’.”\nShe nodded, then led the way onward. When she’d imagined her life as\na top detective and lawwoman, she hadn’t envisioned this. At least the smell\nwas getting better—or she was getting used to it.\nIt was extremely gratifying to find, at the exact spot marked on the map,\nan old metal door set into the sewer wall. Wayne held up the lantern, and\none didn’t need a keen detective’s eye to see the door had been used\nrecently. Silvery scrapes on one side of the frame, the handle rubbed clean\nof the pervasive filth and cobwebs.\nThe people who had built the sewers had discovered it, and highlighted\nit as a site of potential historical significance. But the note had been lost due\nto bureaucratic nonsense.\n“Nice,” Wayne said, leaning in beside her. “Some first-rate detectivin’,\nMarasi. How many old surveys did you have to read to find this?”\n“Too many,” she said. “People would be surprised how much of my\ntime is spent in the documents library.”\n“They leave the research outta the stories.”\n“You did this sort of thing back in the Roughs?”\n“Well, the Roughs variety of it,” Wayne said. “Usually involved holdin’\nsome bloke’s face down in the trough until he remembered whose old\nprospectin’ claim he’d been filchin’, but it’s the same principle. With more\nswearin’.”\nShe handed him her rifle and investigated the door. He didn’t like her to\nmake a big deal out of it, but he could hold guns these days without his\nhands shaking. She’d never seen him fire one, but he said he could if he\nneeded to.\nThe door was shut tight and had no lock on this side. But it seemed the\npeople she was hunting had found it closed too—there were a bunch of\nmarks along one edge. There was enough room to slip something between\ndoor and frame.\n“I need a knife to get through this,” she said.\n“You can use my razor-sharp wit.”\n“Alas, Wayne, you aren’t the type of tool I need at the moment.”\n“Ha!” he said. “I like that one.”\nHe handed her a knife from his backpack where they kept supplies like\nrope, and extra metals in case they faced Metalborn.

Yet she had reports that made her\nwary, and she was increasingly sure this group was funded by the Set.\nYears later, and she was still hunting answers to questions that had\nplagued her from the very start of her career as a lawwoman. The group\nknown as the Set, once run by Wax’s Uncle Edwarn, then revealed to\ninvolve his sister, Telsin, as well. A group that followed, or worshipped, or\nsomehow furthered the machinations of a dark figure known as Trell. A god,\nshe thought. From ancient times.\nIf she caught the right people, she might finally get the answers. But she\nperpetually fell short. The closest she’d gotten to answers had been six\nyears ago, but then everyone they’d captured—including Wax’s uncle—had\nbeen killed in an explosion. Leaving her to chase at shadows again, and the\nrest of Elendel’s elite fully committed to ignoring the threat. Without\nevidence, she and Wax had been unable to prove that the Set even existed\nbeyond Edwarn’s lackeys.\nUsing the knife, she managed to undo the bar holding the door closed\nfrom the other side. The bar swung free with a soft clang, and she eased the\ndoor open to reveal a rough-hewn tunnel leading downward. One of the\nmany that dotted this region, dating back to the ancient days before the\nCatacendre. To the time of myths and heroes, ashfalls and tyrants.\nTogether she and Wayne slipped inside, leaving the door as they’d found\nit. They dimmed their lantern as a precaution, then started into the depths.\n2\n“Cravat?” Steris said, reading from the list.\n“Tied and pinned,” Wax said, pulling it tight.\n“Shoes?”\n“Polished.”\n“First piece of evidence?”\nWax flipped a silvery medallion in the air, then caught it.\n“Second piece of evidence?” Steris asked, making a mark on her list.\nHe pulled a small folded stack of papers from his pocket. “Right here.”\n“Third piece of evidence?”\nWax checked another pocket, then paused, looking around the small\noffice—his senator’s chamber in the House of Proceedings. Had he left\nthem … “On the desk back home,” he said, smacking his head.\n“I brought a spare,” Steris said, digging in her bag.\nWax grinned. “Of course you did.”\n“Two, actually,” Steris said, handing over a sheet of paper, which he\ntucked away. Then she consulted her list again.\nLittle Maxillium stepped up beside his mother, looking very serious as\nhe scanned his own list of scribbles. At five years old he knew his letters,\nbut preferred to make up his own.\n“Dog picture,” Max said, as if reading from his list.\n“I might need one of those,” Wax said. “Quite useful.”\nMax solemnly presented it, then said, “Cat picture.”\n“Need one of those too.”\n“I’m bad at cats,” Max said, handing him another sheet. “So it looks like\na squirrel.”\nWax hugged his son, then put the sheets away reverently with the others."

Long-barreled and\nweighty, they had been designed by Ranette to look menacing—but they\nhad two safeties and were unloaded. It had been a while since he’d needed\nto shoot anyone, but he continued to make good use of his reputation as the\n“Lawman Senator of the Roughs.” City folk, particularly politicians, were\nintimidated by small arms. They preferred to kill people with more modern\nweapons, like poverty and despair.\n“Is a kiss for my wife on that list?” Wax asked.\n“Actually, no,” she said, surprised.\n“A rare oversight,” he said, then gave her a lingering kiss. “You should\nbe the one going out there today, Steris. You did more preparation than I.”\n“You’re the house lord.”\n“I could appoint you as a representative to speak for us.”\n“Please, no,” she said. “You know how I am with people.”\n“You’re good with the right people.”\n“And are politicians ever right about anything?”\n“I hope so,” he said, straightening his suit coat and turning toward the\ndoor. “Since I am one.”\nHe pushed out of his chambers and walked down to the Senate floor.\nSteris would watch from her seat in the observation balcony—by now,\neveryone knew how particular she was about getting the same one.\nAs Wax stepped into the vast chamber—which buzzed with activity as\nsenators returned from the short recess—he didn’t go to his seat. Over the\nlast few days, senators had debated the current bill, and his was the last\nspeech in line. He had secured this spot with many promises and much\ntrading, as he hoped it would give his arguments the advantage, give him\nthe best chance to avert a terrible decision.\nHe stood to one side of the speakers’ platform and waited for everyone\nto sit, his thumb hooked into his gunbelt, looming. You learned to put on a\ngood loom in the Roughs when interrogating prisoners—and he was still\nshocked by how many of those skills worked here.\nGovernor Varlance didn’t look at him. Instead the man adjusted his\ncravat, then checked his face powder—ghostly pale skin was fashionable\nthese days, for some arcane reason. Then he laid out his medals on the desk,\none at a time.\nRusts, I miss Aradel, Wax thought. It had been novel to have a\ncompetent governor. Like … eating hotel food and finding it wasn’t awful,\nor spending time with Wayne and then discovering you still had a pocket\nwatch.\nHowever, the governor’s job was the type that chewed up the good\npeople but let the bad ones float blissfully along. Aradel had stepped down\ntwo years back. And it had made sense to choose a military man as the next\ngovernor, considering the tensions with the Southern Continent. Many\npeople among the newly discovered countries there—with their airships and\nstrange masks—were upset about how things had gone down six years ago."

        "text": "governor, considering the tensions with the Southern Continent. Many\npeople among the newly discovered countries there—with their airships and\nstrange masks—were upset about how things had gone down six years ago.\nSpecifically, that the Elendel Basin had kept the Bands of Mourning.\nRight now, Elendel faced two primary problems. The first was the\npeople on the Southern Continent, the foremost nation of which was known\nas the Malwish. They made constant noise about how small and weak the\nBasin was. Aggressive, militaristic posturing. Varlance had been a hedge\nagainst that, though Wax did question where he had earned all those medals.\nSo far as Wax knew, the newly formed army hadn’t seen any actual\nengagements.\nThe second problem was far closer to home. It was the parts of the Basin\nthat were outside the capital, the people in what were collectively known as\nthe Outer Cities. For years, maybe decades, tensions had been building\nbetween the city of Elendel and everyone else.\nIt was bad enough to be facing threats from another continent. But to\nWax, that was a more distant danger. The immediate one, the one that gave\nhim the most stress, was the prospect of a civil war among his own people.\nHe and Steris had been working for years to prevent that.\nVarlance finally nodded to his vice governor, a Terriswoman. She had\ncurly dark hair and a traditional robe; Wax thought he’d known her in the\nVillage, but it could have been her sister, and he’d never come up with a\ngood way to ask. Regardless, it looked respectable to have a Terris person\non staff. Most governors appointed one to a high position in their cabinet—\nalmost as if the Terris were another medal to display.\nAdawathwyn stood up and announced to the room, “The governor\nrecognizes the senator from House Ladrian.”\nThough he’d been waiting for this, Wax took his time sauntering up onto\nthe podium, which was lit from above by a massive electric spotlight. He\nmade a slow rotation, inspecting the circular chamber. One side held the\nelected officials: senators who were voted into office to represent a guild,\nprofession, or historical group. The other held the lords: senators who held\ntheir positions by benefit of birth.\n“This bill,” Wax declared to the room, loud and firm, his voice echoing,\n“is a fantastically stupid idea.”\nOnce, earlier in his political career, talking so bluntly had earned him\nire. Now he caught multiple members of the Senate smiling. They expected\nthis from him—even appreciated it. They knew how many problems there\nwere in the Basin and were glad someone among them was willing to call\nthem out.\n“Tensions with the Malwish are at an all-time high,” Wax said. “This is\na time for the Basin to unite, not a time to drive wedges between our\ncities!”\n“This is about uniting!” another voice called. The dockworkers’ senator,\nMelstrom. He was mostly a puppet for Hasting and Erikell, nobles who had\nconsistently been a painful spike in Wax’s side. “We need a single leader for\nthe whole Basin. Officially!”\n“Agreed,” Wax said. “But how is elevating the Elendel governor— a\nposition no one outside the city can vote on—going to unite people?”"

        "text": "the whole Basin. Officially!”\n“Agreed,” Wax said. “But how is elevating the Elendel governor— a\nposition no one outside the city can vote on—going to unite people?”\n“It will give them someone to look toward. A strong, capable leader.”\nAnd that, Wax thought, glancing at Varlance, is a capable leader? We’re\nlucky he pays attention in these meetings rather than going over his\npublicity schedule. Varlance had, so far in the first two years of his tenure,\nrededicated seventeen parks in the city. He liked the flowers.\nWax kept to the plan, getting out his medallion and flipping it into the\nair. “Six years ago,” he said, “I had a little adventure. You all know about it.\nFinding a wrecked Malwish airship, and thwarting a plot by the Outer Cities\nto use its secrets against Elendel. I stopped that. I brought the Bands of\nMourning back to be stored safely.”\n“And almost started a war,” someone muttered in the reaches of the\nroom.\n“You’d prefer I let the plot go forward?” Wax called back. When no\nresponse came, he flipped the medallion up and caught it again. It was one\nof the weight-affecting medallions the Malwish used to make their ships\nlight enough to fly. “I dare anyone in this room to question my loyalty to\nElendel. We can have a nice little duel. I’ll even let you shoot first.”\nSilence. He’d earned that. A lot of the people in this room didn’t like\nhim, but they did respect him. And they knew he wasn’t an agent for the\nOuter Cities.\nHe flipped the medallion and then Pushed it higher, all the way up\ntoward the ceiling high above. It came streaking down again, glimmering in\nthe light. As he snatched it, he glanced at Admiral Jonnes, current\nambassador from the Malwish nation. She sat in a special place on the\nSenate floor, where visiting mayors from Outer Cities were given seats.\nNone had come to this proceeding. A visible sign of their anger.\nThis bill, if approved, would elevate the Elendel governor above all\nOuter Cities mayors—allowing him or her to intervene in local disputes. To\nthe point of removing a mayor and calling a special election, approving\ncandidates. While Wax agreed that a central ruler would be an important\nstep for uniting the Basin, this bill was an outright insult to all of their\npeople living outside the capital.\n“I know our position,” Wax said, turning the medallion over in his\nfingers, “better than anyone. You want to make a show of force to the\nMalwish. Prove that we can make our own cities bend to our rules. So you\nintroduce this bill.\n“But this underlines why everyone outside Elendel is so frustrated with\nus! The revolutionaries in the other cities wouldn’t have gotten so far\nwithout the support of their people. If the average person living outside\nElendel weren’t so damned angry about our trade policies and general\narrogance, we wouldn’t be in this position.\n“This bill isn’t going to placate them! It’s not a ‘show of force.’ It’s\nspecifically designed to outrage the people. If we pass this law, we’re\ndemanding civil war.”"

If we pass this law, we’re\ndemanding civil war.”\nHe let that sink in. The others were so determined to appear strong to\nexternal enemies. But if left unchecked, they’d strong-arm themselves right\ninto war over internal disputes. The Malwish problems were real, but not as\nimmediate. Civil war, though, would be devastating.\nThe worst part was, someone was pushing for it in secret. Wax was\ncertain the Set was again interfering in Elendel politics. His … sister was\ninvolved. He wasn’t certain why they wanted a civil war, but they’d been\ntrying for years now. And if he let this proceed, playing into the hands of\ntheir real enemies, both the elite around him now and the revolutionaries in\nthe cities outside would have cause to mourn.\nWax pulled out the stack of papers in his left pocket. He tucked the dog\nand cat pictures at the back, then held the rest up to the room. “I have sixty\nletters from politicians in the Outer Cities here. They represent a large\nfaction who don’t want conflict. These are reasonable people. They are\nwilling—eager—to work with Elendel. But they are also frightened about\nwhat their people will do if we continue to impose tyrannical, imperial\npolicies on them.\n“I propose that we vote down this bill and work on something better.\nSomething that actually promotes peace and unity. A national assembly,\nwith representation for each Outer City—and an elected supreme official\nelevated by that body.”\nHe’d expected boos, and he got a few. But most of the chamber fell\nsilent, watching him hold those letters aloft. They were afraid of letting\npower leave the capital. Afraid that Outer Cities politics would change their\nculture. They were cowards.\nMaybe he was too, because the idea of the Set pulling strings terrified\nhim. Who among those looking at him now were secretly their agents?\nRusts, he didn’t even understand their motives. They wanted war—as a way\nto gain power, certainly. But there was more.\nThey followed orders from something known as Trell.\nWax turned around slowly, still holding the letters, and felt a little spike\nof alarm as he turned his back on Melstrom. He’s going to shoot, Wax\nthought.\n“With all due respect, Lord Ladrian,” Melstrom said. “You are a new\nparent, and obviously don’t understand how to raise a child. You don’t give\nin to their demands; you hold firm, knowing that your decisions are best for\nthem. They will eventually see reason. As a father is to a son, Elendel is to\nthe Outer Cities.”\nRight in the back, Wax thought, turning around.\nHe didn’t respond immediately. You wanted to aim return fire carefully.\nHe’d made these arguments before—mostly in private—to many of the\nsenators in this room. He was making headway, but he needed more time.\nWith these letters, he could return to each senator, the ones on the fence,\nand share the words. The ideas. Persuade.\nHis gut said that if the vote happened today, the bill would pass. So, he\nhadn’t come here to repeat his arguments. He’d come with a bullet loaded\nin the chamber, ready to fire."

        "text": "His gut said that if the vote happened today, the bill would pass. So, he\nhadn’t come here to repeat his arguments. He’d come with a bullet loaded\nin the chamber, ready to fire.\nHe folded up the letters and tucked them snugly into his pocket. Then he\ntook the smaller stack—two sheets—from his other pocket. The ones that\nSteris had brought spares of in case he forgot. She’d probably made copies\nof the other stack too. And seven other things she knew he wouldn’t need—\nbut it made her feel better to have them in her bag just in case. Rusts, that\nwoman was delightful.\nWax held up the sheets and made a show of getting just the right light to\nread. “‘Dear Melstrom,’” he read out loud, “‘we are pleased by your\nwillingness to see reason and continue to enforce Elendel trade superiority\nin the Basin. This is a wise choice. We will deliver half a percent of our\nshipping revenues for the next three years in exchange for your personal\nsupport of this bill. From Houses Hasting and Erikell.’”\nThe room erupted into chaos. Wax settled in, hooking his finger into his\ngunbelt, waiting for the cries of outrage to run their course. He met\nMelstrom’s eyes as the man sank back into his seat. The rusting idiot had\njust learned an important lesson: Don’t leave a paper trail detailing your\ncorruption when your political opponent is a trained detective. Idiot.\nAs the shouts finally died down, Wax spoke again, louder this time. “I\ndemand we hold impropriety hearings to investigate Senator Melstrom’s\napparent sale of his vote in blatant violation of anti-corruption laws.”\n“And by so doing,” the governor said, “delay the Elendel Supremacy\nBill vote?”\n“How could we vote on it,” Wax said, “if we aren’t sure the votes are\nbeing cast in good faith?”\nMore outrage. Wax weathered it as the governor consulted with his vice\ngovernor. She was a smart one. Anything Varlance accomplished that didn’t\ninvolve cutting a ribbon or kissing a baby was probably her doing.\nAs the chamber calmed, the governor looked to Wax. “I trust you have\nproof of this letter’s authenticity, Ladrian.”\n“I have affidavits from three separate handwriting experts to prove it’s\nnot a forgery,” Wax said. “And you’ll find my wife’s detailed account of the\nletter’s acquisition exhaustive and unimpugnable.”\n“Then I suggest impropriety hearings follow,” the governor said. “After\nthe vote on the Supremacy Bill.”\n“But—” Wax said.\n“We will,” the governor interrupted, “require Melstrom, Hasting, and\nErikell to sit out the vote. Assuring that the vote is not corrupted.”\nDamn.\nDamn, damn, damn.\nBefore he could counter that, the vice governor slammed her gavel.\n“Votes in favor of continuing?”\nMost of the hands on the Senate floor went up. For a simple vote like\nthis, a more straw poll method would do—unless the vote turned out to be\nvery close. It wasn’t.\nThe real vote, on the bill, would proceed.\n“Have you any more explosions to detonate, Ladrian?” the governor\nsaid. “Or can we get on with this?”"

Instead, I have a final plea to the\nchamber.” His maneuver had failed. Now he had one last card to play. A\nrequest not from Waxillium Ladrian.\nBut one from Dawnshot, the lawman.\n“You all know me,” he said, turning around in a circle, meeting their\neyes. “I’m a simple man from the Roughs. I don’t do politics right, but I do\nunderstand angry people and the hard lives of working women and men.\n“If we’re going to take the role of parent, we should treat our children\nwell. Give them a chance to speak for themselves. If we keep pretending\nthey’re toddlers, they’re merely going to start ignoring us—at best. You\nwant to send a message? Send the message that we care and are willing to\nlisten.”\nHe took his seat finally, next to Yancey Yaceczko, a good-natured and\npatient fellow—and one of the senators who’d actually listened to Wax.\n“Good show, Wax,” the man whispered, leaning in. “Good show indeed.\nIt’s always a pleasure.”\nYancey would vote with him. In fact, a decent number of the nobles\nempathized with Wax. While a lot of the things Marasi had been saying\nrecently made Wax uncomfortable about his hereditary position, in this\ninstance the lords might turn out to be slightly less corrupt than their\ncounterparts. The elected senators had to retain their seats, and voting for\nthis bill was likely to improve the lives of their constituents.\nThat was the problem. According to the latest census, more people now\nlived outside the city than inside it. Most of the laws dated back to when\nthere had been one city and a bunch of farming villages. Now that those\nvillages had grown up into cities, their people wanted a stronger voice in\nBasin politics.\nElendel was no longer a scrappy settlement rebuilding after an\napocalypse. They were a nation; even the Roughs were changing, growing,\nbeing modernized. Rusts, with all the land in the Roughs, he could imagine\na time when more people lived there than in the Basin proper.\nThey needed to enfranchise those people, not ignore them. He still had\nhope. He and Steris and their allies had worked for months to erode support\nfor the bill. Innumerable dinners, parties, and even—as he’d started doing\nfor some of the city’s elite—some training on the shooting range.\nAll in the name of changing the world. One vote at a time.\nThe governor called for the vote, and Lady Mi’chelle Yomen cast the\nfirst one—against the bill. As it proceeded, Wax sat, as anxious as he’d ever\nbeen before a confrontation with a bandit group. Rusts … this was\nsomehow worse. Each vote was the crack of a bullet.

PROGRESS\nOR PERNICIOUSNESS?\nIn a matter of days, Elendel’s Senate will vote on what Bilming’s top\npolitical mind, Professor Garven Munz, has called “the most monumental\nchange to our government structure since the Words of Founding.”\nDays of speeches, debates, and posturing are planned leading up to the\nvote, and the eyes of the Outer Cities are focused on the so-called Lawman\nSenator of the Roughs, whose recent visits north of the Basin have\nsolidified his stance with which many Outer City dwellers concur:\nRepresentation Before Supremacy.\nGovernor Varlance and his cronies vehemently oppose this tack, their\nviews summed up in Vice Governor Adawathwyn’s bold opening remarks\nthat “We’ll need a strong, experienced leader when war comes to us from\nour masked Southern friends.” Admiral Jonnes of the Malwish Nation\nlooked visibly shaken and did not return after the Senate’s following recess.\nWhen Varlance was asked if he too thought the Basin might be headed\ntoward war with the Malwish, he merely patted his chest where he’d\nconspicuously hung his military medals.\n(Continued on back.)\n3\nMarasi studied the footprints in the dust. They appeared to be a few weeks\nold, as they’d gathered dust themselves. She walked over to Wayne, who\nwas inspecting the path farther down into the depths: an arduous-looking\ntunnel with a steep decline. He glanced at her.\n“If they’re slippin’ in and out of the city fast,” he said, “they musta\nfound a different way out of here. They aren’t makin’ this hike regularly.”\n“Agreed,” she said. “We should be stealthy anyway, in case they posted\nlookouts.”\nIn response, he turned his lantern down and whispered, “You want to\ncontinue without backup?”\n“For now. We want to scout and see what we find. I don’t want to\nmobilize everyone for a dead end.”\nTogether, the two of them struck forward through the tunnel. The\ndifficulty of the path and its apparent lack of traffic encouraged her. If the\nenemy was down here but used a different route, then taking this path meant\nshe and Wayne were less likely to be discovered.\nThey took the decline carefully. Rusts … thank goodness she had\ntrousers on. If she was going to slip and break her skull, she could at least\ndo it with dignity. Or as much dignity as a woman could manage after\nhiking through sewage for an hour.\nShe distracted herself by imagining that these caverns must be as old as\nthe Ascendant Warrior—or even older. These tunnels had slumbered\nthrough the destruction of the world, through the Catacendre, through the\nrise and fall of the Final Empire. Had the stones they walked past broken\nloose from the ceiling during the days of the Ashmounts?\nShe couldn’t help wondering if they would stumble across the mythical\nSurvivor’s Cradle—the Pits of Hathsin—though she knew that was foolish.\nWax said he had been to them, and had found no magical metals of lore.\nThey eventually hit a particularly deep shaft down; it was essentially\nvertical, though with a lot of obstructions and clefts in the stone to climb"

Wayne brightened their lantern again, looking doubtful.\n“We sure they came this way?” he asked in a whisper.\n“Who else would have made the footprints?”\n“Footprints?”\n“In the dust? And near the opening, they were crusted over with sewage\nfrom boots? Seriously, Wayne, you can be remarkably oblivious for a\ndetective.”\n“You and Wax are detectives,” he said. “Not me.”\n“What are you then?”\n“Bullet stopper,” he said. “Skull knocker. Guy who occasionally gets\nexploded.”\n“We’ll be doing nothing like that today,” Marasi whispered. “We will\npeek in, see if I’m right, then get out for clearance and support.”\n“Guess we’ll be comin’ back up this way then,” he said with a sigh, then\ndug the climbing rope out of his canvas backpack. He found a sturdy rock\nformation to tie it around, then tossed the other side down into the darkness.\nHe started down first, then Marasi followed, rifle slung across her back.\nThe descent proved easier than she’d feared, as the rope had knots in it.\nStill, her arms were soon burning.\n“So,” Wayne said softly, dangling below, keeping pace with her instead\nof going on ahead, “wanna hear my list of ways how women break the laws\nof physics?”\n“Depends,” Marasi said. “How misogynistic is it? Can you give me a\nnumber on some kind of scale?”\n“Uh … thirteen?”\n“Out of what?”\n“Seventeen?”\n“What kind of insane scale is that?” she whispered, halting atop a\nboulder and glancing down at him. “Why in the world would you pick\nseventeen? Why not, at least, sixteen?”\n“I don’t know! You’re the one what asked me for a scale. Look, this is\ngood. Women. Break the laws of physics. I’ve been thinkin’ on this forever.\nCouple days at least. You’ll like it.”\n“I’m sure.”\n“Way one,” he said, sliding to the next outcropping. “When they take off\nclothes, they get hotter. Strange, eh? Normal folks, they get colder when\nthey take off—”\n“Normal folks?” she repeated, following him. “By normal, you mean\nmen?”\n“Uh … I guess.”\n“So half the world is not normal? Women are not normal?”\n“It sounds a little silly when you say it like that.”\n“You think?”\n“Look, I just wanted to point out something interesting. Useful\nobservationalizing ’bout the nature of the cosmere and the relationship\nbetween the genders.”\n“I think you thought of something that amused you, and wanted an\nexcuse to say it.” She landed on the little platform next to him, and below\nshe could finally see the bottom. They were roughly halfway.\nHe met her eyes. “So … uh … fourteen then?” he said. “Outta\nseventeen.”\n“And rising. It’s not even true, Wayne. Plenty of men get hotter when\nthey take off clothing. Depends on the man.”\nHe grinned. “What about Allik?”\n“With Allik, it’s more the mask.”"

Depends on the man.”\nHe grinned. “What about Allik?”\n“With Allik, it’s more the mask.”\n“He raises the rusting thing so often, makes you wonder why he wears it\nin the first place.”\n“Moving the mask is like … emphasis to the Malwish. It’s not wrong to\nlet people see under the mask, though they pretend it’s taboo—and maybe it\nwas once upon a time. Now they like the way they can use it to express\nthemselves.”\nHe swung over the side and continued down. She gave him a little\nspace, then followed.\n“So…” he said. “Want to hear number two?”\n“Actually … I kind of do.”\n“Ha! I thought so. Wax would have said no.”\n“Wax had years to get accustomed to the depths of your depravity,\nWayne. To me, it’s still remarkable how you manage to dig yourself deeper\neach and every time.”\n“Fair enough. Number two: Ask a woman how much she weighs. Then\nlift her. She’ll have increased in weight. Feruchemists, every one.”\n“Wayne, that joke is so tired, it slept through breakfast.”\n“What. Really?”\n“Absolutely. My father was making stupid cracks about women lying\nabout their weight when I was a child.”\n“Damn. Old blustering Harms made that joke?” He looked up at her\nwith wide eyes. “Oh, hell, Marasi. Am I getting old? Was that an old man\njoke?”\n“I have no comment.”\n“Damn conners and their damn tight lips.” He reached the bottom and\ndropped off the rope softly, with a rustle of cloth and boots on stone, then\nheld the rope steady for her.\nShe climbed the rest of the way to join him. “So, what’s number three\non the list?”\n“I don’t got one yet.”\n“It’s a list of two items, one of which was dumb?”\n“Two of which was dumb,” he said sullenly. “One was apparently also\ngeriatric. Same jokes as Lord Harms. I’m losing my edge, I am.” He met\nher eyes, then grinned. “Does this mean I get to be the grumpy old one in\nthe partnership? You can be the young spunky one what swears all the time\nand makes bad life decisions.”\nShe grinned. “Do I get a lucky hat?”\n“Only if you treat it well,” he said, his hand over his heart, “and take it\noff before somethin’ unlucky happens, as to not break its lucky streak.”\n“I’ll keep that in mind,” she said, eyeing the tunnel that extended\nonward from the bottom of the shaft. “But let’s cut the chatter—as much as\nI love learning whatever has metastasized in your brain lately, we can’t\nafford to be overheard.”\nHe dimmed the lantern again and they continued along the tunnel.\nPeople at the constabulary offices gave her sympathetic looks on occasion\nfor putting up with Wayne—but the truth was, he could be a really good\nconstable when he wanted to. And he usually did want to.\nCase in point, at her request he kept his mouth closed and concentrated\non the job.

So long as you\ngot past his bubble—not his Allomantic one, but his personal one. Wayne\nwas a fort of a man, with outer walls and defenses. If you were one of the\nlucky few he let in, you had a friend for life. One who’d stand with you\nagainst literal gods.\nWe’re going to find you, Trell, Marasi thought, creeping forward. She’d\nfirst heard that name uttered by a dying man, years ago—and she was\nincreasingly certain Trell was a god of vast power like Harmony. You can’t\nhide forever. Not if you want to keep influencing the world.\nWayne grabbed her arm, stopping her without a word. Then he pointed\nat a tiny light shining far along the tunnel ahead. They crept the final\ndistance, then peeked around the corner and were rewarded by the exact\nsight she’d been hoping for: a pair of men in vests and hats only a few feet\naway, playing cards on an overturned box. A small lamp flickered on their\nimprovised table.\nMarasi nodded backward. She and Wayne crept away again, far enough\nto not be heard whispering. She looked to him in the darkness, wondering at\nhis advice. Should they poke forward further, or was this enough of a\nconfirmation to go get backup?\n“Tragic,” Wayne whispered.\n“What?”\n“Poor sod’s got a great hand,” Wayne whispered. “One in a million. And\nhe’s playin’ against his broke buddy on guard duty? Rusting waste of a full-\non Survivor’s suite…”\nMarasi rolled her eyes, then pointed to a small darkened side tunnel\nsplitting off the main one. “Let’s see where this goes.”\nBehind them, a cursed exclamation echoed in the tunnels; sounded like\nthe fellow with the good hand had just revealed it. This smaller tunnel\nwound around to the right of the guard post, and they soon saw why it\nwasn’t guarded; it hit a kind of dead end. Though some light did spill\nthrough a two-foot-wide hole in the rocks there.\nThey sidled up to it, then peeked through into a midsized cavern—\nroughly as big as a dock warehouse—full of men and women boxing goods\nor lounging on improvised furniture. The hole appeared to be part of the\nnatural rock formations; dripping water from the ceiling had covered the\nwall with odd protrusions and knobs, covering up what might once have\nbeen a larger opening. Marasi and Wayne were maybe fifteen feet up.\nShe let out a long breath and surveyed the operation. It was here.\nMonths of work. Months of promising Reddi her leads were good. Months\nof connecting theft records, witness accounts, and money trails. And here it\nwas. A large-scale smuggling base set up directly underneath the city,\nfunded by—best she could guess—a mix of Outer Cities interests and the\nSet.\nIt was actually here. By Harmony’s True Name … she’d done it.\nWayne looked to her with a wide smile on his face, then nudged her in\nthe shoulder. “Nice,” he whispered. “Real nice.”\n“Thanks,” she whispered.\n“When you tell the constable-general about this,” he said, “leave out the"

Leave those in. You gotta give people what they expect, or they\nwon’t believe your lies when you tell them.”\nMarasi took in the sight. Thirty-seven people, counting the two guards,\nall armed. Even the menial workers wore holsters. Judging by the leads\nshe’d been tracing, those boxes would be full of military supplies—with a\nfrightening number of explosive components. The gang had tried to cover\ntheir tracks by making some more mundane thefts as well, but she was\nconfident she knew what was really happening here.\nElendel had been squeezing the Outer Cities by refusing to let certain\nitems—including weapons—be shipped out of Elendel, which was a central\nhub for all the train lines. This group was acting like an ordinary gang with\ntheir shakedowns and the like, but she was almost a hundred percent certain\ntheir purpose was to funnel weapons toward Bilming, current capital of\nOuter Cities interests.\nShe didn’t like the Outer Cities being forced to work this way—but\nthese gang members had killed innocent people on the streets. Plus, they\nwere likely collaborating with some kind of evil god bent on the\nsubjugation or destruction of the world.\n“Right, then,” Wayne whispered, pointing. “See that fellow near the\nback in the nice outfit? He’s a Set member for certain. Maybe the new\nCycle.”\nMarasi nodded. Cycle was the lowest level of real officer in the Set.\nThey were local bosses that operated gangs of hired muscle. Miles\nHundredlives had been a Cycle, reporting to the Suit above him. This man\nwas dressed in an upscale way—visibly more decorated than the others in\nthe cavern. He was also lean, muscular, and tall. As a Cycle, he might be\nMetalborn. So they’d best not underestimate him in a fight.\n“You plug that fellow in the head with a nice rifle shot,” Wayne said,\n“and I bet the entire group will fold to us.”\n“That isn’t how things work in the real world, Wayne,” Marasi\nwhispered.\n“Sure it is,” Wayne said. “If that’s the guy payin’ them, those other sods\ngot no reason to keep fightin’.”\n“Even if you were right—and I sincerely doubt you are—that’s not how\nwe’re going to do this. Confirmation, coordination, backup, and proper\nauthorization. Remember?”\n“I try not to,” he grumbled. “Can’t we do this one my way? I got nothin’\nagainst some blokes just doin’ their jobs, but I’d hate to hike through all that\nmuck again, then return here and find this lot gone. Let’s bring ’em in now.”\n“No,” she said. “Your way involves too much chaos.”\n“That’s a bad thing because…”\n“Well, there’s the whole officers of the law thing.”\n“Right, right,” he said, then checked in his coat to reveal a shiny badge.\nIt wasn’t something they used in the city, preferring their paper credentials.\n“Is that … Wax’s old badge from the Roughs?” she asked.\n“He traded it to me.”\n“For?”"

They had to\nkeep their lantern darkened though—and that made it difficult to see. So\ndespite being careful, as they returned to the main tunnel they surprised a\nguard who had stepped that direction to relieve himself.\nHe glanced at them in the darkness, then shouted. Wayne had him down\nand knocked out half a second later, but cries of alarm sounded from the\ndirection of the main cavern.\nStill standing atop the body, Wayne looked to her and grinned again.\n“My way it is!”\n4\nThere was no way for Marasi and Wayne to escape using the difficult route\nthey’d taken to get here—not with the entire gang on their tails. Beyond\nthat, she wanted to capture that Cycle, who would certainly vanish after\nthis.\nUnfortunately all of this meant Wayne was right. So much for protocol.\nIt was time to do this his way.\nThey burst into the main tunnel, where the other guard had his gun\npointed toward them. Wayne tossed up a speed bubble, giving him and\nMarasi time to step aside and flank the guard.\nOnce the speed bubble dropped, the gangster fired into now-open space.\nWayne was on him a moment later, laying into him with dueling canes.\nMarasi left him to it, instead picking her spot. Beyond the card table was a\nwide tunnel presumably leading into the main warehouse cavern. She went\nto one knee and raised her rifle, sighting, calming herself, waiting …\nShe fired the moment someone appeared from that direction. Only her\ntraining on the range prevented her from immediately trying to cycle the\nbolt on her gun. This was a new semiautomatic Bastion rifle, and so she\nkept it shouldered and downed the next person who stumbled over the\nfalling body. Those behind called a warning, and no one dared come\nbarreling in after that.\nWayne wiped his brow, leaving an unconscious gangster on the floor.\n“You got the magic boxes?”\n“They’re not magic, Wayne,” Marasi said. “Malwish technology is just\ndifferent but—”\n“Magic boxes from your boyfriend. How many?”\n“I have three Allomantic grenades,” she said. “All of the new design.\nAnd two flash-bangs. Wax charged one of the grenades for me before we\nleft.”\n“Nifty,” Wayne said. “Got a plan?”\n“You hold the tunnel. I’ll go back to that overlook and toss some\nAllomantic grenades to catch groups of enemies, then cover you as you\nmove in. Once you’re out of the line of fire, I’ll follow.”\n“Good as done!” Wayne said, and they split, him heading toward the\ntwo people she’d dropped. There he picked up one of their handguns and\nfired it a bunch of times into the main chamber—not to hit, but to make\nthose beyond take cover. His hand wobbled a little, and he tossed the\nweapon aside as soon as it was empty, but it was excellent progress. Not\nthat he needed to be more deadly, she supposed."

Not\nthat he needed to be more deadly, she supposed.\nShe left him, rounding to the overlook, which made a decent sniper spot.\nShe picked out several groups of gangsters behind nearby boxes, watching\nas Wayne fired a second gun.\nMarasi carefully took a small metal box from the pouch on her belt. All\nher life she had suffered disappointment and even dismissal because of her\nuseless Allomantic talent. She could slow time around herself, which\nwas … well, not much use. It essentially froze her to the perspective of\neveryone around her—removing her from a fight, giving the advantage to\nher enemies.\nShe’d found occasional uses for it, but mostly she’d internalized the\npresumed truth that her abilities were weak.\nThen she’d met Allik.\nHis people revered all Metalborn, Allomancers and Feruchemists alike.\nThough he’d been in awe of Wax and his flashy powers, Allik had been\nequally impressed with her abilities. She had one of the most useful\nAllomantic skills, he claimed. That had been difficult to accept, but the\nupshot was that if you had access to a little specialized technology, you\ncould turn the world on its head.\nPerhaps an inch and a half across, the Allomantic grenade hummed as\nshe burned cadmium—and it absorbed her energy. She wasn’t swallowed by\na bubble of slowness; with these new designs, all the power went into the\nbox. She’d charged it earlier, but that had been hours ago and she wanted to\ntop it off.\nThen, judging the distance carefully, she tossed it toward a group of\nenemies who had gathered behind some boxes for cover. Her months of\npractice paid off; she managed to land the device right in the center of the\ngangsters, who—focused on Wayne—barely noticed it rolling among them.\nThe grenade used ettmetal, which was tightly regulated by the Malwish,\nso she didn’t blame the gangsters for not knowing what to do; even among\nthe Malwish these were rare. If the men had heard of the devices—and they\nmight have, since the Set was known to employ them—they had likely\nnever seen one.\nA second later, a bubble of slowed time popped up around the device,\ntrapping about ten of the men and women. She quickly topped off, then\nthrew, the second of her three grenades—this one aimed at a group of\nenemies farther along. Her aim was true, and she ensnared another eight.\nCalls of “Metalborn!” echoed through the cavern as the rest of the\ngangsters noticed that over half their number were frozen. Those would\nmove in turgid slow motion as they tried to escape the bubble—but the ten-\nminute charge on the grenade would run out before they managed it.\nShe unslung her rifle and laid down covering fire—even picking off two\nof those remaining—as Wayne slipped into the main chamber. He moved in\na blur of speed for a moment, then popped out of his speed bubble and\nleaped over a cleft in the rock. It took a bit between uses for him to recover\nhis talents and put up another bubble, but she swore that time was\nshrinking.\nHe avoided the trapped people; she and he would deal with them later."

Then she dashed back around to the main tunnel. Here she glanced\ninto the warehouse cavern, then ran in a low crouch—careful to avoid the\nfaintly shimmering perimeter bubbles of the grenades. She knew all too\nwell how it felt to be surrounded by that molasses air while everything\naround you moved like lightning.\nMarasi found her own cover near some packing equipment, and as the\nremaining gangsters reoriented, gunfire began pounding the stone and metal\naround her. As a girl, she’d read all about Wax’s exploits in the Roughs—\nand the more she practiced her trade, the more inaccuracies she spotted.\nSure, the stories mentioned gunfire. But they usually left out how loud it\nwas when bullets struck. With them pelting the equipment around her, it\nsounded like she’d given little Max a set of drumsticks and let him loose in\na kitchenware shop.\nA second later the sounds slowed—like a phonograph playing at a\nfraction of normal power. The air shimmered near her, and Wayne slumped\nup against the equipment, a grin on his face—and a bloody wound on his\nshoulder.\n“Sloppy,” she said, nodding to the wound.\n“Hey now,” he said. “Any fellow can accidentally get shot now and\nthen. ’Specially if he’s runnin’ around with a pair of sticks in a room with\nlotsa guns.”\n“How much bendalloy do you have left?”\n“Plenty.”\n“You sure?”\n“Yup.”\n“Wayne, I’m proud of you,” she said. “You’re actually saving it, being\nfrugal like I asked.”\nHe shrugged like it was nothing, but she was legitimately proud of him.\nHe received an allotment from the department, and during the early days of\ntheir partnership he’d always run out on missions. She’d been planning to\ntalk to Captain Reddi about increasing the allotment, until she’d discovered\nthat Wayne used his bendalloy for all kinds of non-combat, non-detective\nwork. Playing pranks, changing costumes to delight children, the occasional\ncasual thievery …\nIt was good to see him doing better.\n“How many idiots left?” he asked.\n“Eleven,” she said.\n“That’s higher than I can count.”\n“Unless you’re doing shots in a drinking contest,” Marasi said.\n“Damn right,” he said.\nTogether they peeked out from around the equipment—which was for\nnailing lids to crates.

You think you can handle this lot?”\n“Aren’t most of these boxes full of stuff what goes boom?”\n“Yes…”\n“Sounds like fun to be had!”\n“You should have another eight minutes or so on the grenades.”\n“Great,” he said. “I’ll see if I can take those sods alive. I can grab them\none at a time from their slowness bubbles, using my bubbles to counteract.\nSee, I’ve been practicing, been gettin’ good at making mine bigger and\nsmaller. Should be able to walk to the edge of one of your bubbles, put up\nmine in a way to overlap one person, then pull them out.”\n“Wayne!” she said. “That’s amazing. Have you told Wax? It’s really\nhard to control the size of your bubbles like that.”\nHe shrugged. “You ready?”\nShe retrieved the flash-bangs from her pouch and handed one to him.\nThen she pulled the pin on the other to light the fuse. “Ready,” she said.\nEven if he had “plenty,” bendalloy was rare and expensive. They needed to\nbe careful with it.\nWayne dropped the bubble, and she tossed the flash-bang. After it\ndetonated, they scrambled out on opposite sides of the machine. Wayne\nwent for the last group of gangsters while she dashed after the Cycle, who\nvanished through a reinforced metal door at the rear of the cavern. She\nreached it a moment later and picked the lock fairly easily. She spared a\nglance for Wayne—who was quickly being surrounded by enemies. He’d\nfound cover behind a box marked EXPLOSIVES. He winked at her, then pulled\nthe pin on his flash-bang and dropped it inside.\nDelightful. Hopefully he knew what he was doing. Wayne’s healing\nabilities were extraordinary—but it was still possible for him to take so\nmuch damage he couldn’t heal. Any blast that separated his metalminds\nfrom the bulk of his body would leave Wayne dead, just like the Lord Ruler\nwhen he’d lost the Bands of Mourning centuries before.\nWell, she couldn’t monitor Wayne all the time. And she most certainly\ncouldn’t survive an explosion of … well, of any size. She slipped through\nthe door and pulled it closed with a loud thump.

        "text": "and beneath a row of chandeliers. Crystal and marble. This was his life now.\nEverything he’d fled as a young man ornamented each footstep, and the\nshadows seemed darker now, despite the twinkling light from above.\nHe believed his accomplishments as a senator could far outshine his\naccomplishments as a lawman, in terms of the raw good done to help the\nmost people possible. That meant his failures carried much higher stakes. In\nthe Roughs you depended on your gun, your instincts, and your ability to\nask the right questions. Here he had to depend on others to do the right\nthing. And so far there had been no greater test of his faith in humanity—\nserial killers included—than working with politicians.\nHe shoved into his chambers and found his family and Kath, the\ngoverness, there already. He tried not to let his displeasure show, but Max\nstill sensed the mood, staying back with Kath and playing with his Soonie\npup.\n“Well,” Wax snapped, throwing himself into his seat, “there goes over a\nyear of work.”\n“We did everything we could,” Steris said, settling down beside him.\n“Did we?” Wax asked, glancing at her stack of notebooks. “I know you\nhave six of those full of new ways to try to persuade individual senators. If\nwe’d had more time…”\n“We did everything it was reasonable for us to do,” she said,\n“accounting for our other obligations.” Then she hesitated. “Didn’t we,\nWax?”\nHe met her eyes, and saw she was trembling. Hell. This would be just as\nhard for her, wouldn’t it? Pay attention, you rusting idiot. He took her\nhands and squeezed them.\n“We did,” he said. “We tried with everything we had, Steris. In the end\nthough, it wasn’t our decision.”\nHe squeezed her hands tightly. Steris was incredibly stable—she’d been\nthere for him ever since his return to Elendel, though he’d never imagined\nhow much she would come to mean to him. In that moment though, he felt\nher shaking. And … rust him if he wasn’t doing the same himself. They’d\npoured so much into stopping this bill. And every single rusting senator\nhe’d talked to had said they needed more time. Now they voted like this?\nNow they—\nNo. It’s done.\n“We need to move forward,” he said.\n“Yes. Forward.” She nodded, then looked around. “And maybe get out\nof this building for a while. Currently, all that’s going through my mind are\nthe various ways a convenient natural disaster could turn it to rubble.”\nWax grunted, and helped Steris gather the rest of their things. As they\ndid, Wax saw an envelope on the corner of his desk. That hadn’t been there\nbefore, had it? Picking it up, he felt something heavy slide to the corner. A\nbullet?\nNo, he discovered after slipping it open. An earring. And with it a small\nnote. You’ll need to make a second, once the proper metal arrives.\nHe had no idea what that meant. And he didn’t care. Not today,\nHarmony, he thought. Leave me alone.\n“What’s that?” Steris said.\n“Something from Harmony,” Wax said.\nShe paused, looking at him.\n“So, likely,” he added, “something useless.”"

Leave me alone.\n“What’s that?” Steris said.\n“Something from Harmony,” Wax said.\nShe paused, looking at him.\n“So, likely,” he added, “something useless.”\nSteris drew her lips to a line. She was a Survivorist, and didn’t strictly\nworship Harmony, who was seen as the god of the Path—a distinct but\ncomplementary religion. Still, after all they’d done and the things he’d seen,\nSteris had adopted a somewhat … cross-denominational view of God. At\nany rate, she knew he’d once worshipped Harmony.\nThese days … Well, he and God had history. Wax felt he’d overcome his\nworst problems with Harmony, ever since their conversation directly before\nhe’d donned the Bands of Mourning. But that didn’t stop Wax from making\nthe occasional snide remark. Today, he shoved the envelope in his back\npocket and put it out of his mind.\nThey packed up their things—rusts, with kids there were so many things\nto cart around. Steris wanted another child, but Wax worried about that. He\ndidn’t fancy being outnumbered.\nBut then again … he couldn’t help smiling as Max went running down\nthe hall, making his Soonie pup leap between black squares of marble,\navoiding the white ones. Wax didn’t normally see the other senators with\nfamilies; they claimed that having children in the building wasn’t\nrespectful. But if they respected the building so much, why had they made a\nmockery of it with that vote?\nA good number did vote as you wanted, Wax had to remind himself. And\nothers are scared. Of being seen as weak. Of outside interests. They’re not\nall slag for voting against you. Remember that. There are some good ones.\nSame as in every profession. It was just … well, he didn’t want to think\nabout that right now.\nOutside the building, fleets of motor carriages had arrived to pick up\nsenators. They’d drive off to parties, or appearances, or informal get-\ntogethers. Even those who worked with Wax rarely invited him along unless\nthey wanted to strategize. It was like they thought he was above simple\nsocializing. Or maybe he made them uncomfortable.\nAs his family gathered to wait for their driver, Max tugged on his suit\ncoat. “Is ya sad, Pa?” he asked loudly. “I hates the sads. Right bad, they is.”\nThe way he said it caused several nearby senators to turn their noses up\nand sniff. Wax cocked an eyebrow. “Has Uncle Wayne been teaching you\naccents again?”\n“Yeah,” Max said, softer. “Says I shouldn’t tell you though, so you’d\nthink I was a genius for doing it on my own.” He smiled. “He told me to\ntalk like that around the senators because it’ll upset them. And they need to\nbe upset today, don’t they? Because they made you and Mother sad?”\nWax nodded, kneeling down. “You don’t need to worry about that\nthough.”\n“Know what makes me feel better when I’m sad?” Max asked.\n“Hugging Tenny?” Wax said, patting the stuffed kandra on the head.\n“Well, that,” Max said, “and … um … flying?” He looked at Wax with\nbig, hopeful eyes."

But\nrusts, who could deny a child when he looked at you like that?\n“Thank you, Hoid,” Wax said. “Please take my wife wherever she would\nlike to go. Kath, you have the harness?”\n“I do, m’lord,” she said, handing Steris the baby, then digging into the\nenormous bag of extra clothing and washcloths. She tossed the harness to\nWax, who gave her his coat and vest in exchange.\nIt gave him an impish stab of glee to pull on the leather harness and\nstrap Max to his back in front of everyone. Then, with a fond kiss for Steris\n—and a promise to meet her at home—he dropped a bullet casing and\nturned toward the crowd.\n“Don’t none of you get jealous or nothin’!” Max shouted. “He can give\nyou a ride fer cheap, if you ask real nice and stop being a pile o’ bad turds!”\nYeah … maybe Wax should have a little talk with Wayne. But for now\nhe waved to the crowd, then launched himself into the air, Max letting out a\nwhoop of riotous glee.\n6\nThe tunnel Marasi entered bore signs of ancient civilization: the remnants\nof brick walls covering up the rough natural stone. A smooth floor, chiseled\nand graded. Sconces on the walls, now pocked with rust as if suffering\nsome terrible disease.\nShe took out the last of her grenades, the one Wax had charged for her.\nThese newer ones could hold a charge for hours—though by now the effect\nwouldn’t last long once activated. Three or four minutes at most. She still\nfelt better holding it—and so, reluctantly, she set her rifle on the ground and\ninstead drew her pistol. It also contained less metal than the rifle, making it\na slightly better tool against a potential Allomancer. For the same reason,\nshe left her pouch with extra metals, though she kept her belt with a few\nnon-metal tools useful for fighting Allomancers.\nGrenade and pistol in hand, she crept forward into the dim tunnel. The\ngang members had hooked some electric lights along the right wall, cords\ntied around the ancient sconces, but they flickered drowsily as if seconds\nfrom nodding off to sleep. She soon reached another vast open cavern but\nlingered at the entrance, crouching and inspecting the path ahead. The\nCycle had come this way, and part of her wanted to scramble after him as\nfast as possible. The more careful part of her kept calm, watching for an\nambush.\nThis particular cavern held a long, narrow rift running from her left to\nher right. An ancient stone bridge had spanned it, but it had fallen long ago\n—and instead a newer construction of boards and rope stretched across the\nperhaps sixteen-foot gap. About thirty feet of stone ground separated her\nfrom the chasm and bridge—and a tunnel in the wall on the other side\ncontinued the path forward.\nShe didn’t go toward the bridge though. She hesitated, still at the mouth"

She hesitated, still at the mouth\nof the chamber. These brick walls were so old. Who had built them,\ncenturies ago? Was this like the Originator Tomb in the heart of Elendel?\nHad people huddled in this cavern, their walls and bridge falling, as\nHarmony remade the world?\nRegardless, she was worried. The Cycle had seen her; her instincts said\nhe wouldn’t just run off, his back exposed. He’d lay a trap. She looked\ncarefully, and glimpsed a dark shape behind some rocks between her and\nthe chasm. He was probably hoping she’d rush across the bridge, so he\ncould shoot her from behind.\nUnfortunately, as she spotted him, he rose and lifted a gun. Marasi\nactivated the grenade—which she’d been holding close to her chest—by\nreflex. It let out a powerful Steelpush, ripping her pistol out of her hand and\ntossing it out in front of her. It fell straight into the chasm.\nHer reaction had been just in time though, because the Cycle unloaded\nhis pistol at her—and each shot missed, the bullets veering away and\nsnapping into stone to either side of her. Marasi dashed straight at him,\npicking out his fine suit in the dim light. His features were more rugged\nthan she’d expected. A thick neck, stubble on his chin.\nShe’d hoped he would be carrying metal, and her advance with the\ngrenade would throw him off balance. Instead he merely lost his own pistol,\nwhich was Pushed across the chasm, hitting the wall on the other side and\nfalling near the path over there.\nOther than that, it appeared he—like Marasi—was wise enough not to\nkeep much metal on his person.\n“By the authority of the Fourth Octant Constabulary,” she said, stopping\nten feet or so from him, “you are under arrest for tariff avoidance,\nracketeering, and the illegal transport of weapons. You’re unarmed and\ncornered. Do the smart thing and surrender.”\nInstead he grinned. Then began to grow.\nHis suit had buttons along the arms, which snapped open, giving more\nroom as his muscles expanded to ridiculous proportions. His jacket stayed\non, but also expanded through clever use of unsnapping wooden buttons\nalong the sides.\nOh, hell. A Feruchemist. He didn’t have the Terris look—but then,\nneither did Wayne. You couldn’t always tell.\nMarasi retreated. Getting into a fistfight with someone tapping strength\nwas a quick road to a crushed face. Instead she switched off the grenade to\nconserve the rest of the charge, and ran for the bridge and the gun on the\nother side. The Cycle lunged forward and cut her off by placing himself\ndirectly in front of the bridge. There, with a laugh, he ripped apart the ropes\nholding it in place.\nOkay. Feruchemists weren’t like Allomancers. They couldn’t just pop a\nnew metal charge into their mouths and keep going. Maybe she could run\nhim out of strength.\nHe dropped the rope, letting the whole wooden construct collapse. “Trell\nhas wanted you in particular, lawwoman,” he noted in a voice that seemed"

Thumping footsteps chased her,\ngaining on her, forcing her to throw herself to the ground just before\nreaching the rifle. Her move let her narrowly dodge a grab.\nShe rolled as he punched, hitting the ground and grunting, then raising\nbloodied knuckles. Feruchemical strength could be dangerous—a lot of the\nMetallic Arts could hurt you. Her own included. She managed to dodge the\nnext punches as well. Fortunately for her, the Cycle didn’t seem practiced\nwith his powers. Despite the prepared clothing, he obviously found it\nawkward to move and fight in this bulkier form.\nWhat kind of Feruchemist didn’t practice with their abilities? She\nscrambled for her rifle, getting to her knees and half lunging, half falling to\ngrab it. He moved first, leaping over her with a powerful bound to snatch\nthe gun. He then snapped it clean in half and hurled the barrel at her.\nShe barely activated the grenade in time, which bounced the barrel back\nat him—but she was holding the box awkwardly. It nearly slipped from her\nfingers at the jolt of force from the thrown object.\nSteelpushes. Force transference. The Cycle wasn’t the only one using\npowers they weren’t practiced with.\nShe turned off the box as the Cycle dodged. The barrel of her rifle\nbounced against the rear wall and then rolled toward her. She reached for it,\nthinking to use it as a club.\nUnfortunately, he lunged and seized her left arm, the one holding the\nbox. His powerful grip squeezed her flesh, and rusts, it felt like he could\ncrush her very bones. Cursing in pain, she scrambled at her belt and the\nsheath there. As her eyes started to water, she brought up a small glittering\nweapon and stabbed him straight through the arm.\nHe howled and dropped her, then yanked the bloody weapon free.\n“Glass dagger,” she said. “It’s a classic.”\nHe glared at her, then held up his arm. The bleeding wound began to\nheal.\nHell. Feruchemical healing? That proved it. She’d never met someone\nwho naturally had two Feruchemical powers. He was using the forbidden\nart. Hemalurgy.\nMarasi grabbed the rifle barrel and backed away, but their fight had\npositioned her so that she could only move toward the chasm. Each step\ntook her farther from the doorway she’d come in through, where she might\nhave been able to escape. Rusts.\nShe retreated, step by step, holding the barrel of her rifle in one hand,\nthe grenade in the other. How much charge did it have left? In the chaos she\nhadn’t tracked how much she’d used.\nThe Cycle followed, sticking her knife into his belt. Then, horribly, his\neyes started to glow faintly red. “Trell is choosing hosts,” he said. “Avatars,\nbestowed with his power. How would you like to be the accomplishment\nthat proves I’m worthy of immortality, lawwoman? All you have to do is\ndie.”"

All you have to do is\ndie.”\nShe continued backward, her mind racing. He didn’t seem worried he’d\nrun out of strength anytime soon. Within moments, he had forced her up to\nthe precipice of the chasm, near the clump of rocks he’d been hiding behind\nearlier. She put those between them, but they weren’t very high.\nA quick glance told her that the chasm now inches behind her was at\nleast fifty feet deep. No escape in that direction.\n“You’ve backed yourself up against a pit,” he said, advancing. “Now\nwhat? Perhaps it’s time to … what was it? Do the smart thing and\nsurrender?”\nInstead she set the grenade to go off on a few seconds’ delay, then\nwedged it securely into a spot among the rocks. Then she gripped the barrel\nof her rifle under her arms and pressed it firmly against her chest.\nHe frowned. Then the grenade went off.\nForce transference. Every Push creates an equal and opposite Push. The\ngrenade shoved the rifle barrel, which hurled her backward with enormous\nforce—straight across the chasm.\nShe smashed back-first into the wall. That was enough to stun her, but\nthen the grenade’s charge gave out. She dropped to the ground. Safely\nacross the chasm as she’d planned, but winded and dazed.\nThrough teary eyes, she saw the Cycle run and leap across the chasm.\nSo she scrambled, half-blinded by pain, searching the dusty stone, looking\ndesperately for the pistol …\nThere!\nHe loomed overhead, a terrible shadow, his arm raised to smash her\nskull. In response, she delivered three shots straight into his face. He\ndropped.\nOh hell, she thought, sitting up despite the pain. Wax did things like this\nall the time. Leaping off cliffs, jumping around and slamming into things.\nHow on Scadrial was his body not horribly ruined by it all?\nShe prodded at her ribs, hoping nothing was broken. Her left shoulder\nprotested the most, and she winced. The pain was so distracting that she had\nto force herself to focus. A shot to the head should stop a Bloodmaker from\nhealing, but some part of her insisted she should check anyway.\nShe lurched over to inspect the corpse. And found the bullet wounds\npulling closed on the man’s head, the holes in the skull resealing.\nRusting hell.\nShe heaved the slumped-over body onto its back and scrambled to pull\nher knife from his belt. He was healing from bullets to the head? Something\nwas very wrong here. She shot him again, but that would only be\ntemporary.\nInstead, she ripped aside his shirt—revealing four spikes pounded in\ndeep between his ribs. As she had suspected. Knife in hand, she began the\ngruesome work of digging the spikes out. She dug faster as she realized at\nleast one of them was made of a strange metal with dark red spots like rust.\nOne they’d been searching for forever.\nThe Cycle’s eyes snapped open, despite his broken jaw and the holes in\nhis skull.

They were glowing a vivid red now.\n“The ash comes again,” the man said through bloody lips, his voice\nstrangely grating. “The world will fall to it. You will get what you deserve,\nand all will wither beneath a cloud of blackness and a blanket of burned\nbodies made ash.”\nMarasi gritted her teeth, working on the rusty-looking spike, slick with\nblood.\n“Your end,” the voice whispered. “Your end comes. Either in ash, or at\nthe hands of the men of gold and red. Gold and—”\nMarasi yanked the spike out. The red glow faded and the body slumped,\nthe healing stopping. She felt at the throat anyway, and even when she\nfound no pulse, she dug out the other three spikes.\nThen she finally leaned against the wall, groaning softly. Wayne had\nbetter have found a way to deal with those other thieves—because Marasi\ndoubted she had the strength to lift a gun at the moment. Instead she closed\nher eyes, and tried not to think about that terrible voice.\n7\nMax called for Wax to make each leap higher, faster. The boy’s shouts of\nglee carried over the rushing wind and flapping clothing. And rusts if that\nwasn’t infectious. Wax had been a solemn child, a trend that had continued\ninto adulthood. But even he appreciated the rush that came from a well-\nexecuted Steelpush.\nThe sudden explosion of speed, the moment of stillness at the zenith.\nThe lurch in the stomach as the plummet began. It wasn’t like any other\nexperience a man could have—at least, not and survive.\nIn the distance a Malwish trade ship hovered into the city, flying using\ntheir strange ettmetal devices, as the two of them bounded across the city,\nafforded a view that was somehow reductive and expansive at once. From\nup so high, you could see the octant divisions along major roadways. You\ncould understand and feel the different neighborhoods, the crunched-up\nforced familiarity of the slums, the expansive yet isolated grounds of the\nmanors.\nOnce, Wax had assumed this kind of experience—not just the height,\nbut the motion while traversing the city from above—would always be\nreserved for Coinshots. Then the Malwish airships had taken that\nassumption and tossed it out a window from three thousand feet.\nRegardless, something about this perspective felt like it belonged to\nhim. This was his city. He’d returned to it, and had—over the years—come\nto love it. It represented the best that people could achieve: a monument to\ningenuity, a home to thousands of different ideas, types of people, and\nexperiences.\nAt Max’s urging he took them higher, using skyscrapers as his anchors\nto Push upward, back and forth, until they landed near the top of one\nbuilding in particular: Ahlstrom Tower.

Fortunately, this\none had several tall skyscrapers unusually close, and that gave him anchors\nto Push himself inward.\nToday Wax didn’t stop at their penthouse. He took them to the roof,\nwhere there was a little built-in platform for a worker to latch on and lower\nwindow-cleaning devices. Wax settled onto it and Max unhooked, though\nhe was still tethered to the harness by a strong cord. Wax wasn’t worried\nabout its reliability. Steris had designed it.\nMax took out a pouch of twirly-seeds and began dropping them off the\nside of the building, watching them go spinning down toward the busy\nstreet below. Despite the height, Wax could hear cars honking on the\nroadway. Six years, and there was barely a horse-drawn carriage to be seen\nin the arteries below. Progress here was like a wrecking crew. You moved\nwith it or you became rubble.\nThe platform faced north. To his left, the shimmering waters of\nHammondar Bay were a vast highway toward … well, he didn’t rightly\nknow what. The people of the Basin weren’t explorers. For all their love of\nstories about Wax in his young days, or worse that fool Jak, most were\ncontent to enjoy their city. That was a problem with Elendel: it had\neverything you thought you’d need, so why go looking elsewhere? They\nhadn’t even realized there was an entire Southern Continent out there until\nan airship had sailed up to investigate the Basin.\nYes, there had been expeditions since then. But most people were\ncontent here, and he couldn’t blame them. His best efforts at improving life\nhad been focused on the Basin. He didn’t know what to do about the\nMalwish. Six years, and he still found the suddenly expansive size of the\nworld intimidating.\nMax hopped up and down with glee, throwing out an entire handful of\ntwirly-seeds. The boy’s fascination with heights made Kath uncomfortable\n—but that was what happened when, from infancy, you were often strapped\nto a father who found ordinary means of transportation too time-consuming.\nWax looked north toward the Roughs. Toward wonder, mystery, and a\nlife he’d loved. He felt …\nRusts. He didn’t feel sad.\nHe blinked, cocking his head. Ever since his return, Elendel had felt like\na duty to him. Adventure and comfort had both been outside the city, calling\nto him. Though things had improved over the years, he’d continued to feel\nit. That call. Until …\nUntil today. Today, he remembered the parts of his life he’d loved in the\nnorth—but he didn’t want them back. He had a life here he loved equally.\nMaybe more, judging by the warmth he felt as Max laughed. This … this\nwas where he belonged. More, this was where he wanted to belong.\nIt felt calming to realize these things. He’d … finally stopped grieving,\nhadn’t he?\nWith a grin of his own, he scooped Max up and gave the child a\npowerful hug—though Max had been too wiggly, even as a baby, to stand\nthat sort of thing for long.

I\nwant to go onto that building over there.”\n“Height first,” Wax said. “Trust me. The higher you throw it, the farther\nI can get it to fly.”\nMax tried again. With more height to the throw, Wax was able to land\nthe ball on the rooftop Max wanted. Then they leaped after it. He wondered\nwhat the people in the neighboring skyscrapers thought of the frequent sight\nof a senator shooting past their windows with a child strapped to his back.\nUnfortunately, the fun of the game could only distract him for so long.\nThey’d been playing for half an hour when he topped a building and was\nconfronted by an awesome sight. The Malwish ship he’d seen earlier had\ncome closer.\nThe wooden construction, moved by giant fans, loomed in the air over\nElendel. Wax had seen Basin attempts to design their own airships using\nhelium or hot air. But the size of the cabin those ships could lift— in the\nmost optimistic of projections—was nothing compared to what the Malwish\ncould field. Their ship soared, a fortress in the sky.\nThis was no trade ship as he’d thought earlier. It was a warship. A show\nof force, though not an overtly hostile one—as it was approaching slowly\nand low in the sky. It was meant to make a statement, not a threat.\nSo, with Max strapped securely back into place, Wax launched them\ninto the air toward the vessel, intent on finding out what was going on.\n8\nMarasi eventually managed to find a service ladder to get her down into the\nchasm and back up the other side. Worn out, she approached the main\nchamber, shaken by what she’d heard and been forced to do. But she carried\na small book of numbers and shipping dates she’d found on the corpse, and\nthat looked promising.\nShe also carried something more dangerous. Four spikes. Curiously, the\nred-spotted one did not like touching the others—it pulled away from them\nif brought close. So she’d wrapped it in a bundle of cloth and kept them in\nseparate pockets.\nShe stumbled through the reinforced metal door and found a scene of\nutter chaos. A large blast had set off several other explosions, judging by the\nscars on the ground. The cavern was littered with shrapnel, pieces of\nequipment, and an alarming number of bodies.\nWayne squatted in the center of it all, his clothes ripped, playing cards\nwith a whole group of tied-up gangsters. He had their cards laid out on the\nfloor in front of them—though their hands were tied behind their backs."

He had their cards laid out on the\nfloor in front of them—though their hands were tied behind their backs.\n“You sure you want to lead with that one, mate?” Wayne asked, nodding\nat the card one of the men had tapped with his toe.\n“It’s the high card,” the fellow said.\n“Yeah, but are you sure,” Wayne said, eyeing his own hand.\n“Um … I think so.”\n“Damn,” Wayne said, laying down his hand. “I play three eights on the\nback of the nines. You win.”\n“But…” another of the men said, “you know our hands … Why would\nyou play it that way?”\n“Gotta pretend I can’t see your cards, friends,” Wayne said. “Otherwise,\nwhere’s the sport in it? Cheatin’s one thing, but if I can just see what you’re\ngoing to do, then … well, might as well be playin’ with myself. And there\nare much funner ways to do that.”\nMarasi stumbled up. He had fifteen of them in various states of\ncaptivity. Exactly as he’d said, he’d been able to use his speed bubble to\ncounteract her slowness bubble and grab them one at a time. His control\nover his powers was increasingly impressive.\nShe wasn’t surprised he’d taken so many captive—Wayne preferred not\nto kill. It was something they agreed on. As for the card game, well … at\nthis point his antics barely shocked her. She settled down on the remnant of\na broken crate. “Wayne, I could have used your help.”\n“By the time I had these chaps all trussed up,” Wayne said, “you already\nhad that fellow in the suit down. I saw you restin’, and it seemed best to\ngive you some time.”\nShe hadn’t even noticed. Rusts, her shoulder still hurt. She grimaced,\nlooking around the room.\n“So, uh,” Wayne said, “damn. Did you turn to cannibalism or\nsomething?”\nMarasi looked down at her uniform, which was covered in blood.\n“Cannibalism? That’s where your mind went?”\n“One sees a lady covered in blood,” Wayne said, “and it goes to a\nnatural place: wonderin’ if maybe she feasts on the livers of the people what\nshe defeated. Not that I’m judging.”\n“Not judging?” Marasi said. “Wayne, that’s absolutely something you\nshould judge someone for.”\n“Right. Shame on you, then.”\nShe sighed. “Here I was thinking that I was finally used to your Wayne-\nness.” She proffered the spikes, each six inches long with a thick head—\nsave for the smallest, most interesting one, which was narrow and thin,\nbarely four inches long. “I dug these out of the Cycle’s body. He would\nhave come back to life, healing himself, if I’d left them in.”\n“How?” he said. “It don’t work that way.”\n“Did for him. This other spike might be why.”\n“Is that…”\n“Trellium?” she said. “Yes. It has to be.”\nWayne whistled softly. “We should celebrate. You save any liver for\nme?”\nShe gave him a flat stare, at which he just grinned. “We don’t eat"

You save any liver for\nme?”\nShe gave him a flat stare, at which he just grinned. “We don’t eat\npeople,” she said to the captives. “He’s just joking.”\n“Aw, Marasi,” Wayne said. “I’ve been workin’ on my reputation with\nthese blokes.”\n“We broke into their cavern,” she said, “defeated their leader, blew up\nmost of their goods, killed half of them and captured the rest. I think your\nreputation is fine.” She narrowed her eyes, noticing that all of the captives\nwere barefoot. “Dare I ask why you took off their shoes?”\n“Shoelaces,” Wayne said, and she glanced at their bound hands. “Old\nRoughs trick when you don’t have enough rope.” He nodded to the side,\nand the two of them stepped away to talk in private. “That’s a lot of\ncaptives, Marasi, and shoelaces aren’t going to hold them real well. Any\nmoment now, one of them will pop out a knife I missed—or worse, a gun.\nSo…”\n“Instant Backup?” she asked.\n“Rusts, I love that code name.”\n“As long as it gets me to a bath sooner, I’m for it. There should be a way\nup to the city through the door I used—and there’s a ladder to the right,\ninside the chasm.” She paused. “Check on the body for me? I have this\nterrible premonition that I missed a spike and he’ll come looking for me.”\n“Got it,” Wayne said. He surveyed the room. “Nice work.”\n“We blew the place up and killed the guy who had the most\ninformation.”\n“We survived,” Wayne said, “stopped a gang of miscreants, protected\nthe city, denied our enemies resources, and recovered some important\nmetals. In my book we did a rustin’ good job. You’re too hard on yourself,\nMarasi.”\nWell … maybe she was. It was the sort of thing you learned, growing up\nas she had. So she nodded and let herself take the compliment, feeling some\nweight lift from her. Wayne jogged off, and she walked back to the tied-up\ngang of thugs, pistol held in a deliberately threatening way.\nJudging by how they looked at her, she didn’t need to do much to\nintimidate them. “You’re the lucky ones,” she said—mostly to distract\nthem. “You’re going to be treated fairly. So long as no one does anything\nstupid.” She fished in her pocket, ignoring the book she’d taken from the\nCycle for now, instead pulling out a notebook that was only slightly coated\nin blood. “I have a list of rights here I’m going to read to you. Listen\ncarefully, so you know what options and legal protections will be available\nto you.”\nShe opened the notebook and burned cadmium, tossing out a bubble of\nslowed time that covered them all. Hopefully they’d be distracted by her\nlecture, because if they were watching the perimeter they’d see the\nsmoldering fires wink out too quickly.\nThat was probably the extent of the clues; there weren’t as many tells in\na cavern as there would be outside, where the motion of the sun, falling\nleaves, or passing bystanders would indicate exactly what was happening."

A few of them stilled as she\npassed; they’d been trying to work out the knots in their bindings. Wayne\nwas right. This many captives presented a potentially volatile situation.\nHopefully backup would come quickly.\nFor now though, she let herself think about the Cycle, whose dying\nwords reminded her of what Miles Hundredlives had said when he had died.\nOne day, the men of gold and red, bearers of the final metal, will come to\nyou. And you will be ruled by them.\nShe touched the trellium spike in her pocket.\nThe ash comes again, the Cycle had said today.\nThat couldn’t be true. The Catacendre had marked the death and rebirth\nof the world. Ashfalls were a thing of myths and old stories. Not something\nof these days, with their electric lights and petrol-powered autos. Right?\nShe shivered and glanced toward the door at the back of the cavern,\neager to spot more constables. It was a relief when a blur indicated someone\narriving. Marasi almost dropped the speed bubble, then paused as she saw it\nwas only one person. Who was this? Wayne? The blurred figure zipped up\nto the perimeter of the bubble and stood there for a moment.\nThat gave Marasi just enough time—an eyeblink really—to pick out a\nfemale figure in dark clothing, a black cloth mask over her face. Not like a\nMalwish mask; more like one a thief might use, prowling in the night. She\nwas slender, with straight black hair. Her eyes seemed to meet Marasi’s,\nthen she became a blur again.\nPerhaps Marasi could have dropped the bubble, but it was over too\nquickly. Indeed, as she was still trying to sort through what had happened, a\nhost of other blurs in constable brown entered the room. A second later,\nWayne jumped into the slowness bubble. He activated his own powers and\nthe two canceled each other out, creating a pocket of normal time around\nthem.\nRust, could she get that good with her bubbles? Her schedule was so\nconstrained that such experiments seemed impossible, but still … it was\nremarkable. And surreal, that she was now unaffected by her own slowness\nbubble. She turned back toward the frozen gangsters, one of whom had\nmanaged to untie himself and was trying to sneak away.\n“You arrived just in time,” Marasi said, noting the constables gathered\naround the bubble with nets and ropes. “Wayne … did you pass anyone on\nyour way in?”\n“No,” he said, frowning. “Why? Your corpse is still out there, dead as\nwhen you deadified him.”\n“There was someone in here a moment ago,” she said. “Maybe fifteen\nminutes ago regular time? She inspected us, then fled.”\n“Bizarre,” he said. “You still have those spikes?”"

She inspected us, then fled.”\n“Bizarre,” he said. “You still have those spikes?”\nShe checked her uniform’s pockets; three spikes on one side, one on the\nother, and they hadn’t been disturbed. “Yes. Ready for the bubble to go\ndown?”\nHe nodded and they dropped their bubbles, letting Marasi shout orders\nto the constables. They moved in methodically, taking the man who’d been\nabout to escape, tightening the bonds on the others. Constable medics\nchecked the dead just in case, and others moved in to gather evidence. Well,\nthe evidence Wayne hadn’t detonated.\n“Come on,” Wayne said. “They can handle this. We should show Wax\nwhat we found.”\n“Well, after some cleaning up,” she said. “Judging by how you smell,\nWayne, I don’t want to know how I smell. But yes. We need to talk to\nWaxillium.”\nAbout more than just the spikes. About glowing red eyes, and cryptic\ndeaths. You will get what you deserve, and all will wither beneath a cloud of\nblackness and a blanket of burned bodies made ash. She left the scene to\nthe other constables, following Wayne as he led the way out.\n9\nA warship’s arrival was certainly an event, but not an unprecedented one.\nThey visited now and then, with permission.\nEven its low altitude, unfortunately, was higher than Wax could reach\nwith his Allomancy. He’d need a metal anchor of incredible size to Push\nhimself that high—either that or he’d need … well, metals he no longer had\naccess to.\nThere had been a time when he’d borne them all. A transcendent flash of\nincredible strength—as if he’d touched the Well of Ascension itself. But it\nwas best not to dwell too long on his experience with the Bands of\nMourning, lest he make all other moments seem dull by comparison.\nToday, he made himself known by leaping up in a few high bounds near\nthe ship. They sent a small skimmer down to collect him and Max, giving\nthem medallions to decrease their weight, though Wax didn’t need one. It\nintimidated the masked Malwish airmen when he handed his back—a\nreminder that he was Twinborn.\nOf the five different nations that made up the Southern Continent, the\nMalwish—these people—were the ones Wax had interacted with the most.\nThey were the only nation that had sent an ambassador to Elendel. And\nincreasingly, all official interactions with the South went through them.\nFrom what he’d been able to gather, these last six years had shaken up\nSouthern Continent politics even more than they had Basin politics. Once-\ntempestuous rivalries had stilled, and unity had been forged. Why squabble\nwith one another when there were actual devils to the north who might\ninvade at any moment? Never mind that Wax’s people couldn’t even make\nairships yet.\nA few minutes later the skimmer—which was shaped a little like an\nopen-topped flying fishing boat—docked with the larger ship. Max was\nunstrapped by now and stood patiently, holding Wax’s hand. Getting to\nboard a real airship was so exciting that Wax could feel him trembling."

Getting to\nboard a real airship was so exciting that Wax could feel him trembling.\nIndeed, as they stepped onto the main ship—into a corridor made of dark\nwood, the walls bowing outward at the center like a tube—Max saluted the\nperson waiting for them.\nThe man was the captain, judging by his intricate mask. Wooden, but\ncarved and inlaid with six different metals in a pattern around the eyes. The\nman glanced at the child but made no move to salute back, as the constable\nofficers cheekily did when Max saluted them. He didn’t raise his mask\neither.\n“Honored Metalborn,” the captain said, nodding to Wax, “and … unless\nI miss my guess, Honored Once-Bearer of the Bands?”\n“That’s me,” Wax said.\n“And also taker of the Bands, which should have been restored to their\nrightful people.”\n“Also me. I delivered them to the kandra, as agreed—to be held so that\nno nation could control them or their power. If you need to be reminded.”\nThey were silent for a few moments, staring at one another.\n“I am Admiral Daal,” the man said—sounding reluctant. “Welcome to\nmy former ship, Blessed Thief.”\n“Former?” Wax asked.\n“I’ve been chosen to be the new ambassador from the Malwish\nConsortium to your nation.”\nMalwish … Consortium? It seemed the unification of the South had\nbeen completed. “What about Jonnes?” Wax asked.\n“She will be returning home,” Daal said. “It has been determined that\nshe has been too … familiar.”\nWonderful. A political shift indeed. It was probably best not to say too\nmuch more than simple pleasantries, to avoid inflaming tensions by\naccident. “Then let me be the first senator to welcome you to the Basin,”\nWax said. “I look forward to continued peace and favorable trade between\nour nations.”\n“Favorable?” Daal said. “For you, perhaps.”\n“We’ve both benefited. You’ve had access to our Allomancers.”\n“Limited access,” he said. “Far too limited compared to the rich\naccommodations you have received.”\n“Three skimmers?” Wax asked. “A handful of medallions? All\nessentially useless without the ability to maintain them on our own or create\nmore.”\n“Surely you don’t expect us to give up the means of our production?\nOne sells the goods, not the factory.”\nEvery time they tried to get more information on medallions from\npeople in the know, they got stonewalled. Obviously these were Malwish\ntrade secrets, which explained part of it, but interviewing Allik they were\nable to consistently pick out discrepancies in what he said and what they\nactually saw. Why weren’t there Feruchemical soldiers in the Malwish army\nwith extremely heightened strength, mental speed, or other dangerous\nFeruchemical talents? Why weren’t there Allomancer medallions? The\nmore they learned, the more certain Wax became that there was a secret\nthere, indicating the medallions were not as effective or as versatile as the\nMalwish would like people to believe.\nRight, Wax thought.

About not inflaming tensions by accident … He was\nquiet, staring at the admiral. Air as tense as a midday duel.\nThen Max tugged his sleeve. “Uh … Dad?”\n“Yes?” Wax said, not looking down.\n“I need the potty.”\nWax sighed. Tense diplomatic situations were not improved by the\npresence of a five-year-old. But it could have been worse—he could have\nbrought Wayne instead.\n“Is there one available?” Wax asked Daal.\n“He can wait.”\n“Do you have children, Ambassador?”\n“No.”\n“Five-year-olds do not wait.”\nAfter another tense moment, the admiral sighed and spun on his heel,\nleading the way past masked sailors. Wax followed with his son. Years\nspent near Allik and others from the South had taught Wax to be\ncomfortable around those masked faces. It was still hard to not feel\nintimidated by that line of shadowed eyes. Not a one speaking, not a one\nlifting their mask. Wax had laughed and drunk with Malwish in the past, but\nthis crew seemed a different class entirely.\nDaal presented the restroom with a gesture.\n“Wow!” Max said, peeking in, the electric light flickering on inside. “It’s\nso small. Like it’s made for me!”\n“Quickly, son,” Wax said.\nMax closed the door and hummed softly as he did his business. Wax\nstood with the admiral, feeling awkward. He actually found himself wishing\nfor Wayne, who had a way of breaking tension like this—by creating a\ndifferent variety of tension entirely. One which allowed you and your\npresumed antagonist to share a moment of mutual embarrassment, maybe\neven understanding.\nI wonder if he does that on purpose, Wax thought. It was hard to tell\nwith Wayne. At times he seemed deeply insightful. He inevitably ruined that\nimpression. But you couldn’t help wondering …\n“The Bands of Mourning,” Daal said. “They are safe, yah?”\n“I assume so,” Wax replied. “I haven’t seen them since we delivered\nthem.”\n“I passed the gun emplacements at the city perimeter,” Daal said. “I’ve\nbeen told about those. The maximum range straight up is what, a thousand\nfeet? Maybe two?”\nWax didn’t respond. It was a little more than that, but … honestly not\nmuch, at least not straight upward, despite what propaganda would claim.\nAnd though the skimmers that had been delivered to the Basin had a\nmaximum altitude of around fifteen hundred feet, he knew that some\nMalwish ships could sail so high that the air grew thin and men would die if\nthey remained there too long.\n“One wonders,” Daal said, “what would have happened if our people\nhad met during a more … warlike era. Why, one quick bombing campaign\nand your city would fold like an old flag.”\n“Fortunate,” Wax said, “that we met now instead.”\nThe admiral turned toward him, eyes peeking out through metal-\nencrusted holes. “What would you have done?” he asked. “If we had simply\nattacked?”\n“I don’t know,” Wax said. “But I think you’d have had a harder time of\nit than you believe.”"

When I know\nthat your demon immortals can’t kill. And your Allomancers? Tell me, how\ndid you reach this ship? By your own power, or…?”\nWhat a delightful individual.\n“Of course,” Daal said, “we don’t live during such … brutal times. I am\nnot here to start a war, Honored Twinborn. Do not look so offended. But I\nrepresent many among us who feel your people have taken advantage of\nour … lenient nature. In particular with the Bands of Mourning. They are\nours, and should reside with us.”\nWax wanted to leap to arguments. Explain the Bands had been found in\nBasin territory. That they’d been created by someone from the North, not\nthe South. That a deal had been fairly agreed. But this man was baiting him,\nand—whatever he’d done in the past—Wax didn’t speak for Elendel. He\nwas only one representative out of many.\nHe refused to be goaded. “Then,” he said, “that is a discussion you may\nhave with the governor and our legislature. And perhaps with God.”\nThe masked admiral regarded him, saying no more. But rusts, if tensions\nwere getting worse …\nThis is the absolute worst time, Wax thought with frustration. With the\nSupremacy Bill passed, there was a real chance the Basin would crumble as\na political entity. How would the South respond to that? Daal said he didn’t\nwant war, but what if the South saw the Basin as easy pickings?\nTheir initial encounters had wowed the Southerners. A northern land full\nof Metalborn and walking myths? But the longer they’d interacted, the\nmore each side had recognized the ordinary nature of the other. Myths\nbecame men. And every society knew how to kill other men.\nMax finally came out, holding up his wet hands to prove he’d washed\nthem. Daal marched them back down the corridor, where Wax strapped his\nson into the harness again.\n“It is good to meet you, Ladrian,” the ambassador said. “Good for me,\nyah? It shows which stories I should believe.”\n“And which are those?”\n“The true ones, of course,” Daal said, and gestured for one of his airmen\nto open the doors, revealing the city below. “I trust my time here will be\nprofitable. Good day, Senator.”\nWith a sigh, Wax threw himself out of the airship—accompanied by a\nwhoop from Max, who seemed to consider this encounter the highlight of\nan absolutely wonderful day.\nWax slowed them carefully with some Pushes, then sent them through a\nseries of quick leaps back to Ahlstrom Tower. The penthouse had a landing\nplatform, and moments later the two of them burst into their suite—Wax\ncarefully locking the door behind them.\nSteris was putting Tindwyl down for her nap, but walked out to the front\nroom a short time later—to find Max playing with a puzzle while Wax\nmixed himself a drink."

Traded for it just like Uncle Wayne says!”\n“Oh. And what did you leave in exchange, dear?”\n“Well,” he said, “you know…”\n“Right. Of course.” Steris joined Wax behind the bar, slipping her hand\naround his waist. “What happened?”\n“New ambassador,” Wax said. “Doesn’t much like us. Wants the Bands\nback. Made some vague threats.”\n“Delightful day for that,” she said.\n“You were right about the unification timetable,” Wax said. “The\nambassador will announce a new consortium of states under the Malwish\nbanner.”\n“That won’t help our work,” Steris said. “The Elendel Senate will see\ntoday’s bill as building a nation out of squabbling cities, a counterpoint to\nMalwish imperialism.”\n“Conquest by another name,” Wax said, nursing his drink. He’d\noccasionaly disparaged Elendel whiskey … but the truth was, some of the\nstuff you could get here was fantastic. Strong flavored, smoky and complex.\nHe’d come to like it better than Roughs varieties—and it was far, far better\nthan whatever Jub Hending had made in his tub, which peeled off layers of\nskin as a punishment for drinking it. He did still miss good Roughs beers\nthough.\n“Well, I do have some potentially good news,” Steris said, slipping a\nletter out of her pocket—she refused to wear skirts without them, no matter\nhow fashionable they were. “It came while you were away.”\nHe slipped the card out.\nMeet us at the mansion at 3:00. Exciting news.\n—Marasi\nThey shared a look.\n“Do we bring Max or not?” Wax asked softly.\n“How likely is it to involve explosions?” Steris asked.\n“With us, you never can tell…”\n“He stays here with Kath, then. His history tutor is coming anyway.”\nWax nodded. “I’m going to wash up, and then we can leave.”\n10\nMarasi felt about a thousand times better when she arrived at the Fourth\nOctant Constabulary headquarters, showered and cleaned up, wearing her\npreferred uniform of a vest and jacket over a calf-length skirt.\nAs a special detective, she technically wasn’t required to be in uniform,\nbut she usually wore one anyway. The uniform was a symbol. It meant she\nrepresented something bigger than herself: the people of the Basin and the\ngood of all. The uniform comforted those who saw her—at least those who\nwere happy to have a constable around. And if it gave warning to those who\nwere up to something, then that was part of the reason for the law.\nAs she entered, younger constables in the main headquarters room\nlowered their reports and conversations hushed, all eyes turning to Marasi.\nThen came the applause."

You weren’t supposed to be applauded\nby your coworkers, were you? More than one new constable—most of them\nwomen—watched her with wide eyes as she passed. Marasi knew that she\nhad specifically inspired both Wilhelmette and Gemdwyn to join up last\nyear.\nThat left her conflicted. On one hand, she’d rather the broadsheets stop\nwriting stories about her. On the other hand, if it was inspiring other\nwomen …\nEither way, she was glad to stride into the back rooms, passing the\noffices of the higher-ranked constables. Even a few of these called out\ncongratulations. She stopped and chatted with a few, asking after their own\ninvestigations. Though she just wanted to be on with her work, this was\nimportant too. You never knew when you’d need another constable’s\nexpertise.\nBesides. It was good to have friends among her peers. Finally.\nEventually she neared Reddi’s office. She passed Constable Gorglen on\nhis way out—the tall man’s head almost brushed the ceiling. He nodded to\nher and made way, and she found Reddi inside the large rear office,\nfrowning at his desk. His drooping mustaches had greyed in recent years,\nand she knew the uniform of the constable-general weighed on him. He was\nmore politician than officer these days, spending half his time in meetings\nwith the city leaders.\n“Constable Colms,” he said, scratching his chin. “Can you make any\nsense of this?” He showed her the drawing, which proved to be a crude\nsketch of Constable Gorglen as a giraffe hiding in a constable’s uniform. It\nsaid Approved by Expert Types at the bottom.\n“I’ll talk to Wayne,” she promised.\nReddi sighed, then slipped the paper into a very large folder on the\ncorner of his desk—the one where he kept complaints about Wayne. Reddi\nhad evidently stopped returning it to the cabinet.\n“I’m sorry, sir,” she said.\n“Sorry?” he asked. “Rusts, constable. Sorry? How many people did you\ntwo bring in today? At any rate, don’t apologize for him—I’ve got a feeling\nif you weren’t keeping Constable Wayne in check, this folder would be ten\ntimes as thick.”\nShe smiled. “He does do best when channeled toward … productive\nactivities.”\nReddi grunted, picking up another folder. “Don’t tell him this, but his\nimitation of me is amusing. Though you should know, those two men with\nthe bowler hats were looking for him again.”\n“Any idea who they are?” she asked.\n“Some accounting firm, probably their collections department,” Reddi\nsaid. “It … seems Wayne owes money to some important people this time,\nMarasi. The kind of people that even I can’t dissuade.”\n“I’ll figure it out,” she said with a sigh. Harmony’s Bands … she hoped\nWayne hadn’t stolen something truly valuable.\n“I’ll leave that to you then.” Reddi rapped the folder with his knuckles.\n“The governor has been breathing down my neck asking for evidence the"

Thank you,\nMarasi. Really.”\n“I hope to deliver even more, sir,” she said. “I have a notebook from\ntheir leader, and it has some interesting shipping manifest information.” She\npulled the book out, then held it open to show him. “We’ll want to make\ncopies, get it through research and code cracking in case I’ve missed\nsomething, but I’ve already read some curious things.”\nShe tapped a list near the front. “This,” she said, “is a series of tests the\nCycle was overseeing to determine what can be shipped into Elendel\nwithout being stopped by customs or raising red flags with inspection\nagents.”\n“Wait,” Reddi said. “Into Elendel?”\n“Exactly,” Marasi said.\n“It’s not illegal to ship things into Elendel,” he said. “This group was\nbreaking the law by smuggling things out.”\n“Which is why this is so intriguing,” she said. “The shipping list is all\nvery mundane, too. Foodstuffs, lumber … but they’ve noted which ones\nwere inspected, which package sizes were suspicious, all of that.”\n“I find this … vaguely unnerving,” he said. “I don’t have any idea what\nit means, and that’s even worse.”\n“I’m going to dig into it,” Marasi promised. “For now, I’ll get some of\nthese other pages copied by the scribes. They’ll give you hard evidence that\nthe explosives and weapons we found today were going to be smuggled to\nBilming. That shipment was leaving the city, as have many others.” She\nhesitated. “I’ve had an idea.”\n“Go on…”\n“I’ll need authorization to work outside the city for a while … and if\npossible, we need to keep this news from the press for a few days. That\nmeans quieting the other constables. I know it will be hard, but it will help\nme chase down the people these men were going to supply.”\n“What are you planning?”\n“According to this book, someone in Bilming is expecting a shipment\nsoon. Weapons, explosives, and … food.”\n“That matches what we found in the cavern,” Reddi said, looking at the\ninitial reports. “Lots of food.”\nThat was curious. Why would they be smuggling dried foods to the\nOuter Cities? Were these soldier or sailor rations?\n“Regardless,” Marasi said, “the Set tends to run silent in times like this.\nI didn’t see any radio equipment down there—they were deep enough that a\nsignal couldn’t get out anyway. So our enemies probably don’t know their\nteam has fallen. Which means…”\n“… We could send in the shipment,” Reddi said. “And perhaps capture\nthe people who are behind all of this.”\n“Or at least move one step farther up the chain.”\n“They’d be expecting to meet with one of their own,” Reddi said,\nrubbing his chin. “We couldn’t maintain the subterfuge for long.”\n“Well, sir,” Marasi said, “we do have the Cycle’s corpse.”\n“There are a lot of people who don’t believe in this shadowy"

But honestly, I’ve learned not to bet against you.”\n“You do have to admit,” Marasi said, “at the very least, that Waxillium’s\nuncle was involved in some kind of paramilitary group.”\n“Yes,” Reddi said, “and someone assassinated him in prison—along\nwith the others who followed him. If you say that was the Set, I believe\nyou. But I need you to be aware—the governor and his people want our\nofficial focus to be on the Outer Cities and the threat they present to Elendel\nsupremacy, not on some secret society that might be pulling their strings.”\n“Understood, sir,” she said. “But I think this could accomplish both\ngoals. Most of the people we caught were common street thugs—not actual\nSet members. I’ll bet the only one down there who had any real contact\nwith the Set was the man who had this book. It mandates radio silence from\ninside the city, to not be overheard, in the days leading up to a drop-off—so\nno one in Bilming is expecting to hear from him. I believe we can surprise\nthem. Particularly since we have that corpse.”\n“Wait,” Reddi said, “how does a corpse help us?”\n“I figured I’d ask Harmony to lend us a kandra to imitate the dead man\nfor the operation. Wayne could be a generic lackey, speaking with a\nBilming accent, to help shore up the subterfuge.”\n“Oh. Um. Right.” Reddi got uncomfortable when she implied she was\nclose with Harmony—and doing so was a little cheeky on her part, since\nshe’d never met him herself. She knew Death far better than she knew God.\nRegardless, Reddi didn’t like being involved with the kandra—Faceless\nImmortals had made him uncomfortable ever since the business with\nBleeder. He’d probably prefer she did her thing and didn’t mention how.\nBut, well, she wanted everything to be on the up-and-up.\nThe department deserved to know how she got her results—she didn’t\naccomplish them without things like Malwish tech on loan from Allik, or\naccess to Faceless Immortals. She’d originally hoped that by making all this\nclear, her reputation would drop to more reasonable levels. She’d been\nwrong. Still, that had its advantages.\n“My reform suggestions?” Marasi asked. “About how we police slums,\nand the proper training of constables? How is that going?”\n“The other constables-general have agreed to the articles,” he said. “All\nbut Jamms, but I think after today he’ll listen. Just need to get the governor\nto sign off on the ideas.” He narrowed his eyes. “I like this shipment plan of\nyours. Get me a detailed proposal.”\n“Will do, sir. We’ll need to move quickly.”"

We’ll need to move quickly.”\n“You will have the full support of the department,” Reddi said. “The\ngovernor is going to be so pleased with today’s results that I can all but\nguarantee you extra funding if your operation requires it. I’ll wait for that\nproposal, but in the meantime I’ll have some people get to work on\nreplacing the supplies that were destroyed today.”\n“Thank you, sir,” she said, taking a deep, satisfied breath.\n“Something wrong, constable?” he asked.\n“No, sir,” she said. “Just … appreciating the path I’ve walked, and\nwhere it’s led me.”\n“Appreciate it on your own time, constable!”\nShe eyed him, and he returned a rare grin.\n“It’s the sort of thing I’m supposed to say,” he explained. “The governor\nlikes it when I’m gruff. Fits his expectations better, I suppose. Oh, before I\nforget. Constable Matieu says you had something specific you wanted to\nshow me? Something that’s not in the reports. Was that the book?”\n“That and a little more, sir,” she said, taking the spikes from her\nshoulder bag. “I want you to turn these three in to the scientists at the\nuniversity.” She held up the thinner fourth one. “I’m going to keep this one\nfor a bit though.”\n“Ruin…” Reddi whispered. “Is that … atium?”\n“No, though it’s nearly as mythical. We think it’s trellium, a metal from\noffworld.”\nHe eyed her. Talk of other worlds didn’t sit right with him either, and\nshe suspected he’d never fully accepted what she said about Trell.\n“Isn’t that the stuff they used to blow up the prison?” Reddi asked.\n“I don’t know if I believe that story,” Marasi said. “There’s no proof\nWax’s uncle had any of this on him.”\n“Still,” Reddi said, “be careful with that. If it’s half as bad as\nettmetal…”\n“I’ll be careful,” she said. “I plan to deliver it to Lord Ladrian for\nstudy.”\nReddi grunted. “I thought he was retired.”\n“Depends,” Marasi said, tucking the trellium spike back into her\nshoulder bag. “For this, you should consider him on the case.”\n“Well, I never revoked his constable privileges.” Reddi wiped his brow\nwith his handkerchief. “Just try to keep him from … causing any incidents.\nWhen he’s involved, things tend to get … unsettling.”\n“I’ll do what I can, sir.”\n“He doesn’t have any other hidden apocalyptic family members or half-\nsane wives with mystical powers, does he?”\n“If any show up, I’ll have him file a report. And maybe move\nconfrontations with them to next quarter, for budgetary reasons.”\nReddi smiled. “I’m glad you’re out there, Colms. Not just for my career.\nI’m glad there’s someone rational around, to … you know, balance the\ninsanity. Go.

Chase your mysteries, and let me know what you need.”\nShe nodded, feeling a deep satisfaction as she left his office and walked\nback down the hallway. She had achieved so much—both in life and in this\ncase. She had done it; she’d arrived.\nAnd is this all? She tucked that annoying thought away and hurried to\nthe commissary, where she grabbed a sandwich and began stuffing it down.\nShe didn’t have long until her meeting with Wax. Still, Marasi was only\nhalfway done when the cleaning lady came to take her tray.\n“Actually, I still have half,” Marasi said, holding up the rest of her\nsandwich.\n“Thanks,” the lady said, taking the sandwich from Marasi’s hand and\ntaking a bite. “I was hungry.”\n“Wayne,” Marasi said with a sigh, looking closer at his face. “What are\nyou doing?”\n“Hidin’ from those bean counters.”\n“The two men with the suits and bowlers?” Marasi said. “They bothered\nCaptain Reddi about you again, Wayne. Who do you owe money to this\ntime?”\n“None of your business,” he said around another bite of her sandwich.\nOne might have thought he’d look silly in a serving woman’s apron and\ncap, but—with the fake breasts—he wore it well. Wayne could never be\naccused of poor fashion sense. Just poor taste.\n“I think it is my business,” Marasi said.\n“No, it ain’t,” Wayne said. “I’ll make sure they don’t bother old Reddi\nno more. You contacted Wax?”\n“I sent him a note. Meeting at three o’clock.”\n“Then why are we wasting time playin’ dress-up?” Wayne said. “We got\nwork to do!”\n11\nWax landed at the front doors to Ladrian Mansion, his ancestral home.\nSteris let go of his waist—as always, she’d clung to him with a death grip\nwhile flying, but had worn a gleeful grin the entire time.\nThey walked up the steps, and Wax undid the locks with a few\nSteelpushes in a specific sequence, causing the door to swing open before\nthem. Others could use a set of keys, but few occupied the place any longer.\nThe staff had moved to the tower along with Wax and Steris. These days the\nplace had a single tenant, who stayed there off and on.\nWax called out, “It’s just us, Allik!”\nAside from giving the Malwish man a place to stay, the mansion had—\nover the years—undergone a small transformation. Space in the Ahlstrom\nTower penthouse was tight, so Wax and Steris kept their projects and\nhobbies here.\nUpstairs, Steris had three rooms for her ledgers, notebooks, and\ncatalogues—which she liked to look through in her spare time. The things\nshe thought they’d need—delivered these days via mail order—might have\noverwhelmed a lesser household. However, having repeatedly benefited\nfrom her preparations, Wax didn’t feel he had reason to object.\nSteris went to the washroom to fix her hair after the flight, but Wax\npaused next to the door, where a pair of long Roughs dusters hung on the"

        "text": "Steris went to the washroom to fix her hair after the flight, but Wax\npaused next to the door, where a pair of long Roughs dusters hung on the\nwall. One was white, and the other—his old one—was sliced into two\nlayers of thick ribbons. A mistcoat. Each coat had a Roughs hat on a peg\nabove it. It wasn’t quite a shrine. Because one of the people it represented\nwasn’t dead; he’d just moved on to a different kind of adventure. Still, Wax\npaused, kissed his fingertips, then pressed them to the wood beneath\nLessie’s hat. Again, it wasn’t quite a ritual. It was merely something he did.\nA moment later, a masked head popped out above the banister on the\nsecond level. “Oh, hi!” Allik said. His current mask was bright red, with\nflakes of yellow paint radiating from the center. It always made him look\neager, like his face was sweating sunlight. Then he raised it, and his toothy\ngrin beamed even more brightly.\nFor all his short, spindly figure and somewhat embarrassing beard, Allik\nwas a force to be reckoned with. At least when it came to his pastries.\n“A new batch is almost done!” he called to Wax. “O Hungry One!”\n“Don’t start that again, Allik,” Wax snapped. “And I didn’t come here\nbecause I’m hungry.”\n“But you’ll still eat, yah?”\n“Yah,” Wax admitted.\n“Great!” He slammed his mask back down and disappeared into his\nroom on the second floor, where he kept the fireplace running overtime.\nHe’d had an oven installed as well, because the Malwish could never have\ntoo much heat. He was technically a “junior goodwill ambassador” to the\nBasin, a title he’d earned two years ago by being willing to take up\nsemipermanent residence in Elendel. Wax had been glad to see it. Allik had\nbeen fooling no one with his constant “coincidental” trips up here to see\nMarasi.\nBesides. His pastries were … well, they were really good.\nMarasi and Wayne were apparently running late, so Wax went to brew\nsome tea while Steris fetched “a few” of her ledgers from upstairs. She\ncame wobbling back balancing some two dozen of them, then plopped\ndown on a couch in the sitting room. Wax gave her a cup of tea, then—\nfrowning—went looking for the source of an odd smell.\nHe’d just found half an old meat bun in the pocket of his mistcoat when\na dog came trotting in through the front door. A large grey- and-white short-\nhaired animal that almost reached Wax’s waist.\n“Hey,” it said with a feminine voice. “Did you bring Max?”\n“No,” Wax said. “I wanted to run some experiments, and you know how\nthose get.”\n“Explody?” the dog—MeLaan—asked. “Well, damn. I kept this body on\nfor no good reason.”\n“Do you actually like playing fetch?” Wax asked, disposing of the\nmoldy meat bun. “From what I can gather, most of you hate nonhuman\nbodies.”\n“Yeah, they’re demeaning,” MeLaan said, settling down on her"

It’s hard to explain to mortals.\nThink of it like an outfit. If you’re dressed up all fancy in a glittering gown,\nyou want to dance and twirl. If you’re wearing trousers with an axe over\nyour shoulder, well, you’re going to want to smash something. I only put\nbodies like this on when a mission requires it. But once I’ve got it on…”\nShe shrugged, a gesture that looked distinctly odd in the dog’s body. “But\nno fetch for me today. I’ll go change.”\nShe wandered off toward the room where Wax let her store her other\nbodies: bones, hair, nails. Most of the bones weren’t real, fortunately. She\nmuch preferred what the kandra called True Bodies, made of stone, crystal,\nor metal.\nHe had joined Steris in the sitting room and was halfway through the\nlatest broadsheet—a boy delivered some each day for Allik—when he heard\nMarasi and Wayne tromp into the foyer. Loud as a freight train, those two\ncould be. He shook his head, sipping his tea.\n“In here!” Steris called, and Wayne burst in a moment later. “Wayne.\nCould you sometime remember to brush your feet off before you track mud\nin? This isn’t the Roughs.”\n“Be glad it’s just mud,” he said. “We been through the bowels of the\nearth today, Steris, and it was full o’ stuff what’s normally in bowels.”\n“A perfectly awful description,” she said.\n“Oh, stop complainin’ at me,” he said, hopping from one foot to the\nother. “We got news. We got news!”\nMarasi strode up and pulled something long and thin from her pouch. A\nsingle delicate spike, like a long nail with a needle point. The otherwise\nsilvery metal had reddish patches to it, especially visible when it caught the\nlight.\nWax breathed in sharply. “You got one. How?”\n“Remember that lead in the sewers I told you about?” Marasi said.\n“Found a member of the Set there, augmented with Hemalurgy, heading up\na gang of ruffians.”\n“Fortunately,” Wayne said, “he didn’t have any use for the spike once\nMarasi was finished with him.”\n“Technically, he did still have a use for it,” she said. “Which is why I\nhad to remove it. Wax, he had four spikes. Isn’t that supposed to give\nHarmony control over a person?”\n“Supposedly,” he said. That had been the whole issue with Lessie.\nThough the numbers varied by species, the principle was the same: spike\nyourself too many times, and Harmony could control you. It was an exploit\nto Hemalurgy that went back to the ancient days, when Ruin had directly\ncontrolled the Inquisitors, like Death himself.\nBut lately, Marasi had begun to encounter members of the Set with too\nmany powers.

Wax hadn’t believed at first, but if she’d confirmed it …\n“The limitation has been circumvented somehow,” Wax said, inspecting\nthe trellium spike. “Perhaps it has to do with the placement of this spike, as\na linchpin?”\n“Wax,” Marasi said, “this group was packing supplies for Bilming.\nWeapons and field rations.”\nHe shared a look with Steris. Rusts … the Outer Cities apparently\nthought war was inevitable. And with the vote today, it very well might be.\nStill, to have another trellium spike after all these years … It reminded\nhim of what had happened to Lessie, but he forced himself to hold it\nanyway. This wasn’t from her body. They didn’t know if her strange\ntrellium spikes had influenced her madness. The kandra all said the spikes\nhadn’t been to blame, but something had turned her against Harmony, sent\nher down a paranoid path. Something had taken the woman he loved and\nturned her into Bleeder. He refused to accept that she’d been fully in control\nof herself.\nThose old pains were dead and buried these days, so he was able to pick\nup the spike and inspect it. This metal was a manifestation—presumably—\nof the body of a god. Much like harmonium, also called ettmetal. What\ncould he learn from this new sample?\nThe door swung open, revealing MeLaan wearing stylish blue trousers\nand a buttoned shirt. She’d been going for an androgynous look these days,\nwith very short blonde hair and almost no hint of breasts. For her friends,\nshe often maintained relatively similar features. This face, for example,\nlooked like her—just thinner, less overtly feminine.\nAs usual she had picked a tall, limber body—this one was at least six\nfoot four. She was toweling off her hair—she liked to wash it after putting\non a new body, to better style it and make sure she’d got the grain right.\n“Hey!” she said, seeing the spike in Wax’s fingers. “Is that what I think\nit is?”\n“Yup,” Wayne said. “Marasi turned some bloke into hamburger to get\nit.”\n“Nice!” MeLaan said.\n“I did not turn anyone into hamburger,” Marasi said.\n“She’s more a fan of liver,” Wayne said, and earned a glare.\n“Speaking of meat,” Wax said, “did you leave a meat bun in the pocket\nof my mistcoat?”\n“Uh…” Wayne said. “It was … um…”\n“You realize I’ll have to get that thing laundered,” Wax said. “And\nyou’re going to pay.”\n“Hey,” Wayne said. “You don’t got no proof I did that.”\nWax gave him a flat stare.\n“You can’t convict me on a hunch,” Wayne said, folding his arms. “I\nknow my rights. Marasi’s always quoting them to people once we finish\nbeating them up. I get a trial by my peers, I do.”\n“Yes,” Steris said, “but where would we find so many slugs on short\nnotice?”\nWayne spun toward her, then—after just a brief pause—grinned widely.\nThose two were getting along better these days, which Wax enjoyed seeing."

What were its properties? Could it be\nmelted? Could it …\nHe paused, then reached to his back pocket. There, nearly forgotten, was\nthe envelope he’d found on his desk earlier. He opened it again and slid out\nthe iron earring, a traditional accoutrement of the Pathian religion—and a\nmeans of communing with Harmony. Piercing your body with metal was a\nway to connect to God and give him some measure of influence over you.\nHe read the note again: You’ll need to make a second, once the proper\nmetal arrives.\nRusts. Why would Harmony tell him to make a second earring,\npresumably out of Trell’s metal?\nThere was no explanation in the envelope, of course. Harmony knew\nWax far too well. A mystery was a better way to get his attention than an\nexplanation.\nDamn him.\nHe tucked that envelope away again. “Nice work,” he said to Marasi.\n“Very nice work.”\n“Thank you,” she said. “We should have a chance at some more\nmembers of the Set soon. I’m planning a sting.”\nShe turned toward MeLaan, who was leaning against the wall, arms\nfolded. For someone who spent her life in subterfuge—imitating others and\ndoing missions for God himself—she certainly did like to stand out. Today\nshe had left her cheeks faintly transparent to allow the emerald of her\nskeleton to show through.\n“I could use your help, MeLaan,” Marasi said. “I have a corpse that\nneeds to get up and walk around—just long enough to trick the Set.”\nMeLaan grimaced. “I would love to, but … I’ve got a thing…”\n“We could work around your schedule,” Marasi said.\n“That might be hard,” MeLaan said. “Since it’s kind of on another\nplanet…”\n“Another planet?” Marasi said.\n“Well, maybe between planets?” MeLaan said. “I’m not entirely sure.\nHarmony wants some of us to strike out, begin exploring, learning about the\ncosmere. It’s become evident that the cosmere knows about us.” She\nnodded toward the spike pinched between Wax’s fingers.\n“What’s it like?” Marasi asked MeLaan, with a certain … hunger in her\neyes. “Traveling out there. How … do you even do it?”\n“It’s difficult,” she said. “Both to get to the other side—which is an\ninversion of the real world—and to travel while there. I’ll be leaving soon,\nI’m afraid, but finding out what’s happening with the Set is a priority for\nHarmony. I’ll ask him to get you one of us to help on your mission,\nMarasi.”\nWax glanced at Wayne. MeLaan was leaving. Soon? He’d have to\ncorner his friend and ask how he felt about that.\nAt that moment however, Allik burst through the door bearing a tray full\nof steaming pastries. “Aha!” he said, mask up to show off his grin. “A full\nroom.

You are\nobviously planning to save the world again, with those concerned faces.\nThis is an action that requires much choc, yah?”\nWax smiled, enjoying Allik’s enthusiasm. He’d bounced back from the\ntragedy of losing so many friends to the Set years ago—tortured for\ninformation about airships. People are elastic, Wax thought. We can keep\nreshaping ourselves. And if we’re not quite the same as before, well, that’s\ngood. It means we can grow.\nAllik handed Marasi a mug of hot chocolate—almost comically large—\nwith a wink. She took his hand and smiled, squeezing it. Four years of\nflirting and two years of formal dating, and those two still acted like\nschoolkids sometimes. Wax knew more about it than he really cared to,\nbecause Steris tended to take notes, then ask if she should be acting in\nequally ridiculous ways.\n“There’s one other thing, Wax,” Marasi said. “I took a notebook from\nthe Cycle I killed today. What do you make of this page?”\nShe handed it over and Wax settled back in his seat, Steris peeking over\nhis shoulder as he read through dated entries in the notebook. “Looks\nlike…” he said. “Annotated shipping records, into Elendel? ‘Box one yard\nsquare, stamped with foodstuff labels, inspected four out of six times.\nLarger crate with warning labels, inspected and quarantined. Crate, two\nyards across, detained every time…’”\nSteris frowned. “It looks like they’re recording what gets inspected\nwhen shipped into the city.”\n“Which is odd, right?” Marasi said. “It’s not hard to get shipments into\nElendel. Only outgoing shipments are taxed for using our railway stations.\nThat’s the entire problem; the Outer Cities are tired of paying us to ship\ntheir goods to one another.”\n“Right,” Wax said. “Why is the Set so interested in what they can get\ninto the city?”\n“Maybe they’re planning to supply a rebel force inside it?” Steris said.\n“But the whole point of their smuggling operation,” Marasi said, “is to\nget weapons out of Elendel. They don’t have any trouble giving weapons to\nthe people inside Elendel.”\nThey sat in silence, considering. Wax glanced at Steris, who shook her\nhead. No thoughts at the moment. Finally, he returned the book to Marasi.\nAs Allik continued distributing pastries, Wax went over to Wayne, who had\nuncharacteristically passed up a mug of chocolate. Allik handed it to Wax\ninstead.\n“Hey,” Wax said to Wayne. “How much health do you have stored up? I\nmight need your help with some experiments today.”\n“Sorry, mate,” he said. “I gots an appointment.”\n“You’re not going to get into trouble, are you?”\n“The reverse,” Wayne proclaimed, then checked his pocket watch.\nWhich was one of Wax’s. “Actually, I gotta get moving. I don’t wanna get\nshot for arriving late.”\n“A moment, Wayne?” MeLaan said.\n“I really—” he began.\n“It’s important. Very important.”"

Wax gripped his\nshoulder, as if to impart some strength. This had been coming. MeLaan was\na wanderer.\nWayne and MeLaan left, and Wax tried to focus on the wonderful gift\nMarasi had brought him. A whole trellium spike.\n“I,” he said, “am going to need my goggles.”\n12\nWayne sometimes pretended he was a hero. Some rusting old figure from\nthe stories, off on some nonsense quest about slaying a monster or traveling\nto Death’s domain.\nLately it was hard to wear that hat. Especially when the truth stared him\nin the face every time he looked in a mirror. He’d made a whole career out\nof pretending. People just thought it was a talent. They never asked what he\nwas hiding from.\nToday, he’d have given almost anything to be someone else. MeLaan,\nwearing that fetching body—they were all fetching, honestly—led him\nthrough the entry hall to a small private sitting room on the other side. He\nmade a swipe for his lucky hat, hanging on the wall outside the room, as\nthey passed. But he missed it.\nInside, she sat him down in an overstuffed chair that made him feel like\na child. Didn’t help that she was as tall as Wax was, in that body. Then she\ntook his hand and crouched down, meeting his eyes.\n“I’m sorry, Wayne,” she said softly. “I need to leave you. Today. It’s\nover. I tried to prepare you for this … but it was probably more painful to\nstring it out, wasn’t it?”\n“Dunno,” he said. “Never had my heart broke before. So I ain’t got no\nexperience.”\nShe winced. “Wayne…”\n“Sorry,” he said. “You gotta do your thing. I know that. A fellow doesn’t\ndate an immortal agent of God himself without suspectin’ that one day he’ll\ntake second place to the fellow what glows.” Wayne frowned. “Does he\nglow?”\n“I thought,” she said, squeezing his hand, “that there would be fewer\nattachments with you.”\n“Where’d you get that idea?” he asked. “I get so attached, I wind up\nwith all sorts of things what don’t belong to me.”\nShe grimaced.\n“Was it … nothing to you, then?” he asked. “Six years?”\n“It wasn’t nothing,” she said. “Just … not what it was to you. I know I\nshould have expected that. TenSoon warned me, Ulaam warned me. Mortals\nsee time differently. They told me. I’m sorry, Wayne.”\n“You ain’t gotta apologize for somethin’ you don’t feel, MeLaan,”\nWayne said. “It ain’t your fault.”\nIt’s mine.\n“I … asked for this mission,” she admitted. “Because I realized I was\nleading you on, and I knew the longer it went, the more painful it would be\nto break off. That’s why I can’t stay and help. I’ve got to go now. Before I\nlose my nerve.”\n“Would that … be so bad?”"

I’d be staying because I\ndidn’t want to hurt you. Not because I actually wanted to stay.”\nHe shouldn’t want her to stay in those circumstances. But he did. Damn\nhim, he did.\nStill, he held his tongue. Sometimes you just had to stand there and get\nshot.\n“It is an exciting mission,” she said. “I get to cross the misted unknown,\nthe dark vastness that Harmony calls ‘Shadesmar.’ I’ll be the first kandra to\ngo out there long-term, with an official mission.\n“I get to explore the cosmere, Wayne. I get to go and see everything\nthere is—worlds we can only imagine. I get to help those who need it—not\none or two people, but entire peoples.”\nHe nodded dully.\nShe stood, then leaned in to kiss him. He wanted to pull away, but …\nwell, he would have regretted that. One long, last kiss, as could be delivered\nonly by someone with a tongue that didn’t confine itself to normal bounds\nof physiology.\n“I did want to tell you something important,” she whispered as she\npulled away. “Something meaningful.”\n“Yeah?”\n“You,” she said, squeezing his hand one last time, “were a really good\nlay, Wayne.”\n“Really?”\n“Really. To be honest, you were the best I’ve known.”\n“You’re seven hundred years old,” he said. “And I was the best?”\nShe nodded.\nWell now, that was something. Something indeed.\n“Thanks,” he said. “That was sweet of you to tell me. It … helps.”\n“I thought it might,” she said. “Goodbye, Wayne.”\nShe let go of his hand and walked out. Knowing her, she’d send\nsomeone to box up the rest of her bodies. She’d picked the emerald today\nbecause it was one of her favorites—she’d probably take it and the\naluminum one on her mission and leave the rest.\nHe sat staring at the door for a long time. He wasn’t wearing a hat,\nwhich meant he had to just be himself. The true him, the one that knew this\npain. They’d ridden together on many a dusty path. This pain had been his\ninvisible friend since childhood.\nThe pain of knowing what he really was.\nThe pain of being worthless.\n13\nWax led the way down to the basement, feet thumping on steps behind him\nas he was followed by Steris and Marasi. While the upper floors of the\nmansion were dedicated to Steris’s hobbies and the various needs of his\nfriends, the basement belonged to Wax. And he’d made some modifications.\nHe’d begun pursuing metallurgy in the Roughs, where the mining towns\noften had equipment to test metal purities and the like. He’d been surprised\nat how useful the hobby had turned out to be. For example, few criminals\nrealized you could track their suppliers by testing bullet casings.\nIn Elendel, he’d expanded his curiosity tenfold.

        "text": "In Elendel, he’d expanded his curiosity tenfold. A basement full of metal\nsamples, acids and solvents, burners, microscopes, and even a room with a\nforge and an anvil. It all reminded him of the Roughs in a good way. Of\nLessie laughing when he made a breakthrough. Of evenings spent folding\nmetal like he was some ancient warrior making a knife meant to kill a god\n—rather than a novice trying to make a dining implement.\nLately, he’d found electrolysis and plating fascinating, and his new\nelectricity-powered spectrometer was absolutely brilliant. Together with the\ngraphs representing the spectroscopic colors of various elements, it let him\nidentify practically anything. How would trellium react to that? Or to his\nacids, or to the magnets?\nThe questions energized him. It was a kind of excitement he’d lost\nduring his middle years. It was too pure. He hadn’t been able to feel\nexcitement about something so simple and enriching at a time when his life\nhad been falling apart.\nHe strapped on his goggles. Steris followed, putting on her own, then\ngot out her clipboard. She handed him an apron, and he relented—he was\nwearing one of his nicer vests, though he’d tossed the cravat aside\nsomewhere. Her own apron was more enveloping and thick, almost a flak\njacket. He’d only recently persuaded her that maybe she didn’t need two\npairs of goggles at once; she could just order an extra-thick pair.\nThey set up at one of the tables, where Wax inserted the spike into a\nclamp to hold it steady.\nMarasi stopped in the doorway, then grinned. “You two,” she said, “are\nadorable.”\nWax shared a look with Steris. “I don’t believe I’ve been called adorable\nsince I was Max’s age.”\n“She should get her eyesight checked,” Steris said. “Marasi, dear? I\nhave goggles with corrective lenses, arranged in the drawers to your right.”\n“I’m fine,” Marasi said, stepping in.\nSteris clicked her tongue and pointed at the sign just above the doorway.\nGOGGLES REQUIRED. It had an asterisk and a scrawled handwritten note\nbelow—in crayon—that said, “’Cept Wayne.”\n“It’s a good rule,” Wax said. “You know how things happen around us.”\n“Things?” Marasi said, selecting a pair of goggles. “You mean\nexplosions?”\n“Not just explosions,” Steris said. “Acid spills. Fires. Accidental weapon\ndischarges. Though I suppose that one is technically a subset of explosion.\nHow’s the hardness?”\n“Hard,” Wax said as he tested the spike with various substances.\n“Scratched by diamond, but barely marks corundum. Just above a nine.”\n“Noted,” she said.\n“It’s brittle too,” Wax said, carefully chiseling. “Not like harmonium at\nall, which is nearly as pliable as gold. Would you get one of the burners\ngoing?”\nSteris lit a gas nozzle. Wax got a chip of trellium off and brought it over\nin a tungsten alloy bowl, then set it under the flame and watched carefully.\nThe chip soon heated to white-hot, but did not liquefy.\n“Melting point is extremely high,” he said. “Over twenty-five hundred"

The melter ran a powerful electric current through the metal\nin order to heat it beyond what the burner could manage. He’d had some\nluck with harmonium using this process. Unfortunately, although the little\nbit of trellium again turned white-hot, it wouldn’t even bend or stretch.\n“Rusts,” Wax said softly, using tinted goggles to stare at the glowing bit\nof metal. “This stuff is hard.” How was he going to make an earring out of\nit?\nWas he actually considering that? At the thought, he realized he didn’t\nknow the envelope was from Him. Anyone could drop off something like\nthat. He should talk to Harmony before doing anything foolish.\n“TenSoon says that the metals are the bodies of divinities,” Steris said.\n“So-called God Metals were the source of the mists back in antever- dant\ndays.”\n“So why weren’t everyone’s lungs burned?” Wax said. “If I can heat this\nto over three thousand degrees without it liquefying, then it must be\nextremely hot when vaporized.”\n“Perhaps,” Steris said, “these metals—unlike common ones—don’t\nchange states based on temperature, but on other factors.”\nWax nodded in thought. Marasi leaned down beside the table, looking at\nthe spike. “It’s full of power,” she said. “It’s a Hemalurgic spike, so it’s…”\n“‘Invested’ is the term the kandra use,” Wax said. “It has taken a part of\na person’s soul, through Hemalurgy, and stored it. Like a kind of … battery\nfor life energy.”\nMarasi shivered visibly. “It’s kind of like a corpse, then?”\n“A murder weapon, at least,” Steris agreed, turning off the burner.\n“Wax,” Marasi said, sounding reluctant, “when I was pulling this out of\nthe Cycle, he started ranting. The way Miles did when he died.”\nWax looked up from his experiment. “What did he say?”\n“He talked about men of gold and red,” Marasi said. “Like Miles. And\nthen … he talked about starting the ashfalls again, as in the Catacendre.\nRestoring the days of darkness and ash.”\n“Impossible,” Wax said. “The land just isn’t set up that way anymore.\nThe Ashmounts are either nonexistent or stilled. There isn’t the tectonic\nactivity to cause another ashfall.”\n“Are you sure?” Marasi asked.\nHe hesitated, then shook his head. “When Harmony showed me Trell’s\ninfluence enveloping our planet, even he seemed baffled. Our world, and\nour god, are basically three and a half centuries old. There are things out\nthere that are far, far more ancient. Far, far more crafty.”\nThe lab fell silent, save for the hum of the electric current machine,\nwhich Wax flipped off.\n“So we catch up,” Steris said, rapping her pencil against the clipboard."

He also noticed his cravat\nsticking out of the pocket of her dress.\n“Spectroscopy,” Wax said in response to her question. “Let’s burn some\nflakes.”\n“Wait,” Marasi said. “You couldn’t get it to melt—how are you going to\nburn it?”\nHe took a file to the clamped spike, catching the shavings on a piece of\nthick cardstock. “Most metals will burn, Marasi, if you can get the pieces\nsmall enough and can apply enough oxygen. We’ve managed it with\nharmonium, even though we couldn’t melt it fully.”\n“That’s … strange, isn’t it?” she asked.\n“Indeed,” Wax said. “But we are, as has been noted, talking about the\nbodies of gods.”\nHe set up the spectroscope and managed to burn some flakes, using the\noxygen line, to take some readings. Then he heated a piece again to get it to\nemit light waves and took readings on that. The machine made a pen move\non a piece of paper, like a seismograph—only here, the highs and lows\nrepresented frequencies of light. Those patterns of light corresponded to\ndifferent elements.\nIn this case, strangely, he got a straight-across line—a full spectrum.\nThough at the end of the spectrum, in the red, the machine tried to send the\nline higher than the maximum. Which shouldn’t have been possible, for all\nthat he’d seen it once before.\nHe unscrewed the pin holding the arm in place on the paper and reran\nthe machine. Again a full spectrum at maximum—into the red, where the\npin on the arm swung out and off the paper with a jerk.\nWax breathed out. “Seems proof it’s a God Metal.”\n“Indeed,” Steris said, scribbling notes in the darkness.\n“Someone tell the dumb conner what’s happening,” Marasi said. “How\nis this proof of anything?”\n“It’s complicated,” Wax said. “Each element has a kind of signature,\nrepresented by the wavelengths it releases when heated. It’s basically a way\nto identify elements and compounds. Like using fingerprints to identify a\nperson.”\n“And this metal,” Steris said, “somehow projects a full spectrum, as if it\nwere made of pure white light. But it also has something strange happening\nin the red, as if it has a light beyond what the machine can calculate or\nread.”\n“I’ve only seen something like this once before,” Wax said.\n“From harmonium?” Marasi guessed.\n“Yes.” He tapped the table, then shook his head. “In dealing with these\nmetals, so many things seem to break the laws of physics. I feel like I’m\nexperimenting with something dangerously beyond our understanding.”\n“Should we move to the safe box?” Steris asked.\n“Probably wise,” Wax said. “Particularly since the next step is to put\nsome of these shavings into acids.”\nThe “safe box” was Steris’s name for the small reinforced box they’d"

Three feet square and three feet deep, it was made\nout of aluminum and steel, with a large safe-like door on the front. That\ndoor had a small plate of very thick glass at the top, so you could look in.\nThis contraption could take a grenade without trouble, and had handled an\nettmetal-water explosion before.\nHarmonium—ettmetal—was highly unstable. You needed to keep it in\noil, as it tended to react even to the air. Since they couldn’t know how\ntrellium would respond to his acids, Wax set everything up inside the box,\nthen latched it closed. From there, he could use some thin arms on gears\ninside to tip a little bit of trellium into each of the ten flasks of acid—and\ntwo flasks of a base.\nHarmonium wasn’t affected by acids, but maybe this metal would be.\nAnything to give him more of a foothold, help him understand. As he\nworked, Marasi walked over to the wall where Steris and he had pinned\nideas, experiments, and thoughts regarding harmonium. Rusts … the oldest\nof those were over five years old now. Wax found it depressing to realize\nhow little progress they’d made.\n“All of this,” Marasi said, reading the notes. “I don’t think I’ve looked\nat it closely before … You’re trying to split it.” She spun toward him.\n“You’ve been trying to divide harmonium into its base metals? You’re\ntrying to create atium!”\nHe looked back into his viewer, continuing to dump flakes into the acid.\n“Not just atium…” Marasi said. “Lerasium too? That’s the metal that …\nIt created Mistborn! It’s explained in the records left by Harmony.\nAllomancy entered the world because the Lord Ruler gave lerasium to some\nof his followers, who burned it and were changed. Those first mythical\nMistborn—they held incredible power. You’re trying to replicate that.”\n“No,” Wax said. “I’m trying to see if it can be replicated.”\n“All these years,” Marasi said, “and you never told me why you kept\nneeding ettmetal? I thought you were trying to figure out how to make\nairships, like everyone else!”\n“We’ve barely made any progress,” Wax said, finishing with the acids\nand turning away from the safe box. “But Marasi, don’t you see? The Set is\ndevoted to restoring the ancient powers to people—they’ll use eugenics,\nHemalurgy, anything. So if it’s possible to make lerasium again, we need to\nknow about it.”\n“You still could have told me,” she said.\n“I wanted to have something useful to show first,” Wax said. He walked\nover to join her, passing Steris, who was fiddling with the trellium spike.\nBeside Marasi, he looked up at the wall of pinned ideas again.

But now,\nstaring at this board, he remembered the rest of the experience. The slow,\nsteady realization that he wasn’t going to crack this particular puzzle. He’d\nworked on enough hopeless cases to realize when one was growing cold.\nHe was a hobbyist, not an expert. He’d shared his notes with the people\nat the university, and they’d thanked him—but had plainly already made the\nsame observations. If a breakthrough with ettmetal was going to happen, it\nwould come from those dedicated scientists working to build Elendel its\nown airships, Allomantic grenades, and Feruchemical medallions.\nHe would probably have to turn the trellium spike over to them. He’d\nhave his fun for a few days, but this was too important to keep from the real\nexperts.\n“Waxillium?” Steris said from behind. “You should come look at this.”\n“What?” he asked, turning.\n“The trellium spike,” she said, “is reacting to the harmonium.”\n14\nWayne ducked into the alley just in time. Those two fellows with the bowler\nhats passed by on the sidewalk a moment later. Wayne crouched there, heart\npounding, and counted to a hundred before letting himself relax. Close call.\nHe’d mostly recovered from the meeting with MeLaan. In fact, he\nfigured he’d handled it quite well. Nothing was broken, nobody was broken\nbut him, and he’d only needed three shots of whiskey to get moving after.\nPlus, he’d realized what his day was going to be.\nIt was a rusting funeral.\nYou could take quests and flush them away. He was having a funeral\ntoday, and that was that. He had worn his nice jacket and a matching hat, all\nfancy and proper. He even had a flower in the lapel, which he’d paid for.\nWith actual money. Fancy is as fancy does.\nHe rejoined the procession on the street outside. Yes, they all seemed to\nknow it was a funeral day, they did. So many heads down rather than\nlooking up at the sun. So many dull faces, like they were the dead, still up\nand moving because … well, in the city, there were jobs to do.\nDid dead people think funerals were celebrations? Initiation parties?\nReverse birthdays?\nHe kept his head down, acting like a member of the masses on the\nsidewalk. This city, it just had so many people. Floods of them on the\nstreets in this part of the octant, the financial district, all in their funeral\nfinest. It should have been easy for anyone to fit in since there was basically\nevery sort of person you might want to meet. But somehow the financial\ndistrict mashed people up into a similar ball of cravats and heels. You could\nalmost not notice that some were Terris and others were koloss-blooded.\nHard to miss that rusting airship dominating the sky, but keeping your\nhead down helped.

Roughs hats. Bright red shirts. Chaps? Oh, Ruin. He was\ngoing to gag. At least the greeter at the host’s stand was in a proper suit.\n“Your hat, sir?” the man said, and Wayne handed it over, then swiped\nthe bell off the stand.\n“Um, sir?” the greeter asked, looking at the bell.\n“You’ll get it back when you return my hat,” Wayne said. “A man gots\nto have insurance.”\n“Uh…”\n“Where’s my table? It’s got two pretty women at it, and one of them’s\nnice, but the other probably threatened to shoot you when she was bein’\nseated.”\nThe host pointed. Ah, there they were. Wayne nodded and stalked that\ndirection. Rusting terrible attire for them to all wear on a day like this. You\ndidn’t go to a funeral in chaps unless you rode there on a horse. Or unless\nyou were old Three-Tooth Dag, who liked that sort of thing.\nRanette was Ranette: curvaceous—though he wasn’t supposed to talk\nabout it—and wearing slacks. Jaxy was in a fine white dress, with short\nwhite-blonde hair in very tight curls, accented by diamond barrettes. She\nliked sparkles. He didn’t blame her. Far too few sparkles in life. Adults was\nsupposed to be able to wear what they wanted, so why did so few choose\nsparkles?\nHe sat down with Ranette and Jaxy, then thumped his forehead down on\nthe table, making the silverware rattle.\n“Oh, delightful,” Ranette said in a dry voice. “Drama.”\n“Wayne?” Jaxy asked. “You all right?”\n“Mumble mumble,” he said into the tablecloth. “Mumble.”\n“Don’t humor him,” Ranette said.\n“Yes, humor him,” Wayne grumbled. “He needs it right now.”\n“What happened?” Jaxy asked.\n“I am officially dumped,” he said. “And my whiskey is wearing off.\nStupid body. Metabolizing and neutralizing poisons as if I didn’t dump ’em\nin there on purpose.” He looked up. “You think I could cut out my liver and\nstay drunk forever?”\n“I’ll humor him on that one,” Ranette said.\n“I’m sorry, Wayne,” Jaxy said, patting him on the hand.\n“’S all right,” he said. “At least you dressed up fer the funeral.”\n“The…?” Jaxy asked.\n“Ignore him,” Ranette said.

Like, to be authentic you’d have to have only stew on the\nmenu. Then when people ordered it, you’d be out of stew and just give them\nbeans.”\n“I like it,” Jaxy said. “It’s amusing.”\n“It’s insulting,” Ranette said.\n“Can we talk more about me?” Wayne said. “Because I’m still over here\nfeeling like what’s left of the grapes after the wine’s been made.”\n“Poor dear,” Jaxy said.\n“You’re too good to him, Jax,” Ranette said.\n“He’s one of your oldest friends.”\n“Only because he can’t die.”\n“Ranette…” Jaxy said.\n“Fine,” Ranette said, then put her hand on Wayne’s shoulder. “You’re\nstrong, Wayne. You can get through this.” She took the glass from the tray\nwhen the server came back, and handed it to him. “Look, here’s your\nalcohol.”\n“Thanks, Ranette,” he said, accepting it. “You really know how to make\na fellow feel better.”\n“To be honest,” she said, “I’m proud of you, Wayne. How you’re\nhandling this. It’s relatively mature.”\n“This is mature?” he asked, then downed the vodka.\n“Relatively.”\n“Suppose you gotta be an adult to get booze,” Wayne admitted. “But …\nit’s just…” He sighed and sat back. “I didn’t think I’d ever meet someone\nwho understood what it was like to have to be another person most of the\ntime. And she did. She did, Ranette.”\n“You’ll … uh, find someone else?” Ranette said. “Someone better?\nThat’s what I’m supposed to say, right?

Even if you have\nterrible taste in women.”\n“Hey!” Ranette said. “You chased me for the better part of fifteen years.”\n“Yeah? And how’s my taste, on average?”\n“I…” Ranette said. “Damn. Stop aiming for the vital bits, Wayne. This\nis supposed to be a friendly meal.”\n“Sorry,” he said, then put his elbows on the table, holding his head in his\nhands. They still hadn’t seen their actual server, which made sense. This\nwas a seriously fancy place; you could tell by their contempt for their\ncustomers.\n“I meant it though, about being proud of you,” Ranette told him.\n“You’ve grown, Wayne. A lot. We’ve been going to dinner for years now,\nand you haven’t hit on me once.”\n“I promised. Besides, you’re taken. I ain’t a poacher.” He slumped back\nin his seat. “This wouldn’t be so bad if that day weren’t coming up.”\n“The day…” Ranette said. “When you have to deliver payment to that\ngirl?”\nWayne nodded. “Allriandre,” he said. “She and her sisters don’t have a\ndaddy because of me.” His day of trials was the worst day of the month,\nwhere he had to go face her. And admit what he’d done: murdering her\ndaddy over twenty years ago.\nYou know you aren’t forgiven.\nI know.\nYou will never be forgiven.\nI … I know.\nRanette leaned forward, tapping on the saltshaker with her fingernail. It\nwas in the shape of a Roughs-style boot. So fancy that the awful decor\nsomehow wrapped around to being tasteful.\n“What if,” Ranette said to him, “you didn’t see her this month?”\n“I’ve gotta,” Wayne said.\n“Why?”\n“It’s my punishment.”\n“Says who?”\n“The cosmere,” Wayne said. “I took her daddy from her, Ranette. I gotta\nremember. What I am. I gotta look her in the eyes and let her know I ain’t\nforgotten.”\nThe two women shared a look.\n“Wayne,” Jaxy said, “I’ve … wanted to talk to you about that. The way\nyou treat that girl. I realize today might not be the best day…”\n“Nah,” he said. “Hit me, Jaxy. I’m mostly numb already. It’s a good day\nto get punched.”\n“Why do you insist,” Jaxy said, “on seeing her in person?”\n“So she can punish me.”\n“Does she want to punish you?”\n“She seems to enjoy it when it happens.”\n“Does she? Does she really, Wayne? Because the way you tell it, sounds\nlike she asks you not to come see her.”\n“Because she’s bein’ too nice,” Wayne explained. “But I don’t deserve\nanyone bein’ nice to me.”"

What was she on about?\n“I’ve never met anyone,” Jaxy said, “who can get inside the heads of\nother people as well as Wayne can. He’ll understand.”\n“He gets in their heads when it suits him,” Ranette said. “Not when it\nmeans seeing things he doesn’t want to see.”\nWayne looked away. Ranette said a lot of mean things, but they\nweren’t … well, they weren’t actually mean. He joked, and she joked. And\nsure, sometimes there was an edge of truth to it, but that’s what friends was\nabout. Making you look a little silly when you were together, so that you\ndidn’t look really stupid when you were apart.\nBut the way she said that last bit … it stung. He understood people,\ndidn’t he? Wax and Marasi, they were great at the investigating part. But\nthey needed someone like Wayne who really knew the people who lived in\nthe dirt—and counted themselves lucky, because at least it wasn’t mud.\nCurrently.\n“Wayne,” Jaxy said, “what do you imagine that girl wants? Can you\nthink like her? Does she really want you to come remind her of her pain\neach month?”\n“I … I want her to be happy. And beating up a fellow like me who made\nher unhappy … well, that’s the best way.”\n“Is it?” Jaxy asked softly. “Or is it about you? Doing some kind of\npenance? Wayne, each time you ignore what that girl asks of you, you take\na little joy from her and turn it into your own suffering.”\nHe squeezed his eyes shut.\n“You can see it,” Jaxy said, patting his hand. “I know you can.”\n“I’ve lost my appetite,” he said, shoving back from the table and\nstalking off through the restaurant.\nFrom behind, Ranette’s voice chased him. “I told you. He might not be\nas bad as I pretend, Jax. But he’s not as good as you want to pretend either.”\nHe traded the bell for his hat back, and only took one of the fellow’s\ncufflinks in the exchange—a fair trade for them keeping his hat over some\nstupid bell that barely even worked. Outside, unfortunately, he all but\ncollided with two men in bowler hats and vests.\nRust and Ruin! They’d found him.\n“Sir,” the taller of the two bean counters said, “we need to talk about\nyour finances.”\n“Whataboutem?” Wayne said, shoving his hands in his pockets.\n“You have far too much money,” the shorter one said. “Please, sir. We\nhave to talk about your investment strategy! Your current lack of\ndiversification is a crime.”\nWell, to ashes with him, then. This day had actually found a way to get\nworse. He let them shove him into their hearse of a car, off to the mortuary.\nOr, well, the accounting firm that kept track of his wealth. Same difference."

Same difference.\nIn either case Wayne, as everybody knew him, was dead.\n15\nThe trellium was moving.\nSteris had been getting out a harmonium sample for study in conjunction\nwith the trellium spike. And the trellium did not seem to like it.\nWax moved the small bead of harmonium—suspended in a vial of oil—\ntoward the trellium. It again rolled away.\n“Curious,” Wax said. Then, on a hunch, he burned a little steel inside of\nhim.\nThe trellium spike rolled away from him again. “I didn’t Push,” he said.\n“It responded to me burning steel.”\n“That’s a result!” Steris said, scribbling furiously. “Wax, that’s actually\nuseful.”\nAnd … yes, it was, wasn’t it? A way to test if someone was burning\ntheir metals? Seekers could do that, but having a mechanical way to\naccomplish it …\n“Oh!” Marasi said. “I should have mentioned. That spike had a similar\nreaction to the other spikes I harvested.”\n“It’s like Allomancy,” Steris said. “Like the trellium spike is using\nAllomancy to Push.”\n“No,” Wax said. “It’s more like magnetism. The trellium spike responds\nto other sources of Investiture in the way one magnet responds to another\none.”\n“It wants to stay apart from them,” Steris said.\n“More like it has the same charge,” Wax said. “I doubt that it ‘wants’\nanything.” Though, as this was part of a god, who knew? Particularly since,\nso far as he was aware, other Invested items with a similar charge didn’t\nrepel one another.\nA little experimenting showed him that the two metals—harmonium and\ntrellium—repelled each other with increasing strength the more he tried to\npush them together. Again, like magnets. The response to harmonium was\nstronger than the response to him burning his metals.\nWax consulted a large chart on the wall; it displayed an extrapolation\nfrom a notebook that Death had given Marasi. Once upon a time, that event\nhad been one of the most surreal Wax had ever heard described. These days\nit seemed almost commonplace.\nThe book detailed how to use Hemalurgy. He’d studied the notes in\ndepth, and had created a chart of all the points on the body where spikes\ncould be placed. A detailed list of the ways they worked, requiring linchpin\nspikes to coordinate and keep the network functioning.\nThe Set was experimenting further with Hemalurgy. And his sister,\nTelsin, was out there somewhere, high up in the leadership of the Set. Seven\nyears ago, he’d thought she’d been kidnapped … but he should have seen.\nTelsin’s incredible ambition fit perfectly with the Set’s goals.\nIt had led her to spiking herself.

In his fingers, he held not only a relic\nfrom a long-forgotten god; he held a tattered symbol of his sister’s rejected\nhumanity.\nRusts. He really was going to have to talk to Harmony, wasn’t he? As\nlittle as Wax liked it, he was a part of this. He needed to finish what he’d\nbegun all those years ago, when he’d fled Elendel—leaving his house to the\nmachinations of his sister and uncle.\nFootsteps on the stairs announced Allik, arriving with refreshments.\nWax wasn’t certain if the former airman did that so assiduously because he\nthought of this mansion as his home and wanted to entertain, or if he just\nenjoyed having people around to try his baking. Nevertheless, the sight of\nhim—mask up, grinning widely and bearing two plates of chocolate biscuits\n—did lighten Wax’s mood.\n“You are being careful,” Allik said to Wax, “never to put too much\nettmetal in one place, yah?”\n“I don’t think I have enough to worry about.”\n“Still, always good to remember,” Allik said. “One of the basic rules of\nhandling it.”\nThey had all kinds of odd rules about the metal, and Wax had trouble\nseparating the superstitions from the science. Supposedly, you couldn’t put\na large concentration of ettmetal in one place, otherwise it caused strange\nreactions—though Allik didn’t know specifics.\nThe perky Southerner marched up to Marasi with his offerings and held\nthem out.\n“Oh!” Marasi said, snatching a biscuit. “My favorite.”\nWax took one too. He was accustomed to biscuits that could block a\nbullet in a pinch. It was the Basin way. Yet these were moist, even gooey. It\nwas odd, but not unwelcome.\nMarasi in particular seemed to be infatuated by the way Allik put\nsweetened chocolate in everything. “They’re best when warm,” she said,\nmunching as Allik sat across from her. Wax had wiped off that lab table,\nhadn’t he? “You know, you look more handsome when I’m eating choc.\nHow curious.”\n“You just say that,” Allik replied, “because you want me to make more.”\n“Of course that’s why I say it,” she replied, seizing a second biscuit.\nWax sat back on his stool, enjoying his biscuit, thinking about the\nmetals laid out on the table in front of him. Harmonium and trellium. They\nrepelled each other. More and more violently, the closer together they\nwere …\nI wonder …\nHe gathered up the materials and was setting up a new experiment in the\nsafe box as another set of footsteps started down the steps. This made them\nall pause. Wax carefully slipped some bullets from his pouch, ready to Push\nthem. Though when the door opened, it revealed a prim man in a brown\nsuit. He had stark blond hair—perfectly styled—and spectacles with wire\nframes. The type of person whose entire bearing screamed, “I fact-check\npeople’s jokes.”\n“VenDell?” Wax guessed, putting his bullets away. The kandra was\nwearing a new body, but the creature’s air was distinctive."

The kandra was\nwearing a new body, but the creature’s air was distinctive.\n“Indeed, Lord Ladrian,” VenDell said, entering the room and undoing\nhis satchel. “You’ll forgive me for letting myself in.” He set a piece of\npaper on the table beside Marasi. “This is for you, Miss Colms.”\n“What is it?” she asked, wiping her fingers on a napkin that Steris\nmaterialized as if from nowhere.\n“A note recovered from the site of your engagement with the Set,”\nVenDell said. “LeeMar recovered it before the other investigating\nconstables could notice it.”\n“Wait,” Marasi said. “You have kandra among the constables I don’t\nknow about?”\n“Several,” VenDell said.\n“Who?”\n“Cassileux, for one. LeeMar took over her life about sixteen months\nago, after the real woman died in that raid on the Nomad Gang.”\nMarasi’s jaw dropped. “But … Cassileux and I had lunch last week!”\n“Yes, she keeps an eye on you,” VenDell said.\n“She didn’t tell me!”\n“Should she have?” he asked absently, then sniffed at the biscuits that\nAllik offered him. “How horrible.”\n“Aw,” Allik said, his shoulders slumping.\n“I’ve told you, Master Allik,” VenDell said. “I am a carrion feeder, and\nstrictly carnivorous. These … creations … would not suit me. But if you are\ninterested, I’ve been considering putting up good money for one of your\nmasks.”\n“What?” Allik said, hand going to his mask, which was still up on the\ntop of his head. “My mask?”\n“There has been discussion among the kandra lately,” he said, “about\nyour masks. Many of us think they are as integral to your natures as hair or\nnails—virtually a part of your skeleton. As such, I have decided to start\ncollecting them for future bodies. Do you have any for sale?”\n“Uh…” Allik said. “You’re an odd man, yah?”\n“I’m not a man at all,” VenDell said. “I’ll leave you with an offer; let me\nknow if you’d entertain some negotiations. I would only require the mask\nafter your death, of course. If you persist in spending time with this group\nof people, that might not be far off.”\nHe walked toward Wax next, then held out his hand. “May I see it,\nplease?”\nWax sighed, then turned to the safe box where he’d been setting up his\nexperiment. He took out the trellium spike and presented it to VenDell, who\nheld it up toward the light.\n“I thought you couldn’t touch those,” Steris said from the table beside\nMarasi.\n“You are mistaken, Lady Ladrian,” VenDell said. “This is not a kandra’s\nspike, so touching it is not taboo.”\n“I’m not going to let you take this one,” Wax warned. “It needs to be\nstudied.”\n“Unfortunately,” VenDell said, “I have no intention of recovering it, so\nwe won’t get to see if you could actually prevent me or not.”"

Unlike\nthe ones that belonged to Lessie, which you stole from us.”\n“You gave those up willingly.”\n“I was not in an emotional state to do anything willingly,” Wax said. “I\nstill want to know how much that metal—trellium—had to do with what\nhappened to her.”\n“The way Paalm … acted was a direct result of her decision to remove\none of her spikes,” VenDell said. “The trellium spikes may have\nexacerbated her ailment, but were not the root cause.”\n“Harmony implied otherwise to me.”\nVenDell turned the spike over in his fingers and didn’t reply. Instead he\nnodded toward the safe box. “What are you doing here?”\n“Electric current to soften some harmonium,” Wax said, pointing at the\nequipment he’d set up: a system to deliver a powerful current through a tiny\nnugget of harmonium held at the center, coated in oil to prevent it from\ncorroding. “That’s the closest we ever came to dividing it.”\n“It cannot be divided,” VenDell said. “Not so long as Harmony remains\nHarmony. I’ve explained this.”\nSteris trailed over with her clipboard, and they shared a look. It was\ntrue; harmonium wasn’t actually an alloy. Yet Harmony held both Ruin and\nPreservation—so somehow this metal was both atium and lerasium,\nblended in a way that defied ordinary scientific explanation.\nIt seemed reasonable there would be a way to split it. Yet, acids for\nselective dissolution had failed. Different heating methods to get the\ncomponents to self-separate while fluid had failed. Electrolysis had failed.\nA dozen other ideas had failed as well. There was a reason he’d lost\nmomentum on the project. But of all they’d tried, electric currents seemed\nto have come the closest. He activated the machine, and didn’t bother\nclosing the front of the safe box. He’d run this experiment often enough that\nhe was comfortable doing it in the open.\nThe tiny bit of harmonium heated up. Marasi and Allik walked over,\nwatching it glow with a powerful internal light. Then Wax activated the\nother component of the machine—which pulled the nugget apart.\nHarmonium was pliable, more so when heated. When softened like this,\nit seemed to react differently to the air—no longer as volatile. As if … as if\nit were becoming something else.\nThis specialized machine continued to deliver electric current through\nthe grips at the sides—but now those moved apart and stretched the metal.\nIf he continued, he could divide it cleanly, making two pieces of\nharmonium. That itself wasn’t remarkable. But the machine was set to pull\nonly a few sixteenths of an inch, then stop. The result was two globs of\nharmonium at the sides, with a narrower stringy bit between.\n“What is this supposed to do?” VenDell asked.\n“Watch,” Wax said.

The glob of\nharmonium on the left side began to glow a blue-white. The one on the right\nadopted a stranger air, growing silvery and reflective. It almost seemed\nliquid, like mercury—the surface incredibly smooth.\n“Is that…?” Marasi asked.\n“No,” Wax said. “If you cut it in half right now, when the metals cool\nyou’ll just have two bits of harmonium. Yet in this state, the metals almost\nseparate. You can see the left bit taking on aspects of lerasium. The bead on\nthe right … that’s how atium was described.”\n“It always looks like it wants to divide,” Steris said. “That it’s arranging\nitself to do so.”\n“Ruin and Preservation,” Marasi whispered. “Atium and lerasium.”\n“I think that’s the reason harmonium is so unstable,” Wax explained.\n“Harmony has trouble acting, right? He’s mentioned it before: his two\naspects work against one another, leaving him indecisive, impotent.”\n“He’s merely in equilibrium,” VenDell said. “Equal parts the need to\nprotect and the need to let things decay.”\n“Well,” Wax said, “I’m increasingly certain we face a god who isn’t\nhindered by that kind of equilibrium. I was skeptical at first, but Marasi\nconvinced me.”\n“Trell is dangerous, VenDell,” Marasi said, squinting against the bright\nlight. “We have to do something. We can’t wait for Harmony.”\n“Almost I am persuaded,” VenDell said. “What did you think of the\nnote?”\n“It’s confusing,” Marasi said. “And vague.”\nWax shot her a glance.\n“I’ll explain,” she promised. “But first … are we going further with\nthis?” She nodded toward the safe box they were all crowded around.\n“Well,” Wax said, taking the trellium spike back from VenDell, “we\nnoticed that this metal repels all forms of Investiture—and it repels\nharmonium even harder. I thought … what if I stretched a nugget apart like\nthis, then used trellium to try to split it? Might that repel the two sides\nharder, and actually separate out some atium and lerasium?”\nHe looked to the others in turn.\n“What … are the chances that blows things up?” Allik asked.\n“Considering harmonium is involved?” Steris said. “I’d say it’s\nincredibly likely. But worth a try.”\n“That’s why we have the safe box, right?” Wax said. “Plus, that’s a very\nsmall bit of harmonium. How much energy could one piece of metal\ncontain?”\nThe words hung in the air.\n“So…” Allik said. “I think we should all go next door and be very far\naway when he does this, yah?”\n“Yah,” Marasi agreed.\nWax took a deep breath, then nodded. “I’ll rig a timer,” he said. “This\nbasement is reinforced with enough concrete to pave a highway, so we\nshould be fine upstairs.”\n“We could make the kandra do it,” Marasi said. “They’re basically"

I have been instructed to help you with your little infiltration—I\nbelieve you have a corpse for me?—not to risk my life trying to accomplish\nthe impossible.”\n“Timer it is,” Wax said.\n“I’ll get a tiny sliver of trellium,” Steris said, “so we don’t have to use\nthe entire spike.”\n“Good idea,” Wax said. He should be able to repurpose his hydraulic\npunch …\nIt took a good half hour to set the whole thing up. All the while, Wax\nwondered. What if he did split harmonium? He’d have two metals, the\nbodies of gods, each capable of incredible things from ancient lore, like\nmanipulating time or creating beings with mythological Mistborn abilities.\nWhat if he had that power? What would that change about him?\nNothing, he thought to himself. I’ve held that power. And when I had it,\nI used it to save my friends.\nHe finished the calibrations, leaving a machine on a timer set for five\nminutes. Once the time was up, it would press the tiny trellium shard\nforward into the center of the heated and stretched harmonium bead.\nHe closed the safe box tight, and together they all fled up the stairs and\nsecured the thick metal door at the top. And then … Wax realized five\nminutes had probably been excessive.\n“So…” he said as he pulled out his watch, “what about that note?”\n“It was in one of the boxes in the cavern,” VenDell explained. “One of\nthe few that weren’t destroyed in the explosions.”\n“During the mission earlier,” Marasi said, “I spotted a masked figure in\ndark clothing. I had a slowness bubble up at the time, and she approached\nas a blur. I got barely a glance at her before she left, but I think this must be\nfrom her.”\nShe turned the paper toward Wax, showing a simple message.\nWe are watching, Marasi, it read. And we are impressed.\nIt had a small symbol at the bottom, with three interlocking diamonds. It\nlooked vaguely familiar to Wax, though he didn’t think he’d ever seen the\nsymbol before. More, the pattern reminded him of something.\n“You ever seen this?” Wax asked VenDell.\n“Uh…” he said, “that is a question I’m forbidden to answer. My\napologies, Lord Ladrian.”\n“Forbidden?” Steris asked. “By whom?”\n“Harmony himself, Lady Ladrian,” VenDell said. For the first time that\nWax could remember, the creature looked uncomfortable. “I suggest you\nspeak to him directly.”\n“Great,” Marasi said. “Nice to know we’re working for the defense of\nthe planet itself while God is acting like a child with a secret crush.”\n“False gods are like that,” Allik said, and earned glares from all around\nthe room. He just shrugged.\nThey all fell silent. Why, Wax thought, does a few minutes feel like\nforever when you’re waiting?"

Enough to buy two or three\ncars, if he’d wanted.\n“Right, then,” Wayne said. “Here’s what we’re going to do. You see this\nhere?” He unfolded something from his inside pocket—a flyer recruiting\nboys for a local noseball league. “We shall give these chaps funding for\nequipment and will build for them a location in which to enjoy their\nengagements.”\n“Sir?” Short Boring Guy asked. “Why?”\n“We’ll include seating,” Wayne explained, “and allow everyone to\nwatch. See, right now everyone wants someone to yell at. And we, my\nfriends, shall provide it for them. We shall create a large-scale noseball\nleague, with a team from each octant. I’ve thought, gentlemen, for some\ntime that the city needs a way to become drunken in a proper and controlled\nmanner.”\n“I don’t understand, sir,” Tall Boring Guy said.\n“A bar exists for a reason,” Wayne said. “It is a controlled environment\nin which to drink. People are going to seek to partake in spirits, you see,\nand it is better for society that we plan for this.\n“Currently, the octants are tense. The people are angry. The Outer Cities,\nwhy, they are riotous! We must allow rage to be experienced in a similar\nway to drunkenness—with a controlled outlet, with someone for everyone\nto dislike.”\nThey looked at him blankly.\n“We’re gonna get a bunch of chaps to beat on one another,” Wayne said\nin a lower-class accent. “Playin’ for teams representin’ the octants, so\neveryone can pick their favorite and hate all the other teams. In a right\nproper way.”\n“Ah!” Short Boring Guy said."

Why, he suspected this\npair didn’t even know how to properly burnish a golden toilet! For fear!\n“Yes…” Tall Boring Guy said. “I see. So, like the local clubs, but on a\ncitywide scale.”\n“People love their local teams,” Wayne explained. “We can do\nsomething good with that.”\n“Building arenas of the proper size will be expensive,” Short Boring\nGuy said. “Even for you.”\n“We could charge people a bit to get in the door, then,” Wayne said.\n“Everyone enjoys something more when they have a monetary stake in it.”\n“Yes…” Tall Boring Guy said. “Yes, this is interesting. Monetization of\nthe rivalries—and the personal coding of interest—will be a seminal part of\nthis activity…”\n“That is my favorite part of most activities,” Wayne noted.\nTall Boring Guy nodded. “This is excellent. We shall put our best people\non it.”\n“Nah,” Wayne said, “put your worst ones on it. They’ll know more\nabout loafing—the rapscallions—which shall serve me better in this\nparticular situation. Now, let us discuss the beating of servants and how it’s\nnot really so bad for them.”\nRusts, this hat. He pulled it off and wiped his brow. Stupid money and\nstupid rich hats. This one even had aluminum foil on the inside to protect\nfrom emotional Allomancy.\nWell, surely this idea with the noseball would finally bankrupt him. It\nwas, after all, his very worst idea—and he was an absolute idiot. He spun\nthe hat on his finger and thought about it. What if Wax—or worse, Marasi\n—figured out he was rich? He’d never hear the rusting end of it.\nTall Boring Guy tugged at his collar. “Do you … actually want us to\ninvestigate using more corporal punishment on, um, some of your staff?”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “Bein’ in the army stinks.”\n“Sir,” Short Boring Guy said, “what about the provisions in your trust?\nWe’d like to talk about the more unusual ones you’ve made.”\n“Nope. Next.”\n“Your current housing situation—”\n“Nope. Next.”\n“Have you yet confirmed with Waxillium that he understands he signed\naway likeness rights to you in that deal—”\n“Nope. Next.”\n“Your fleet of cars?”\nThose he liked. “What about them?”\n“There’s a new Victori,” Short Boring Guy said, getting out a picture of\nit. It had no top. Like, so you could drive and spit into the wind, if you\nwanted.\n“Damn, that’s nice,” Wayne said. “Get me one.”\n“Absolutely, sir,” Short Boring Guy said. “How many shares in the\ncompany shall we buy?”\nWayne narrowed his eyes at him. “I see what you’re doing.”\nThey looked at him innocently.\n“No more than a five percent stake,” Wayne said, “and once these guys\nwhat play noseball get famous, have them drive the cars around so they get\nmore popular and whatnot.

I’ve never met anyone who can get inside\nthe heads of other people as well as Wayne can. He could even get inside\nthe heads of accountants.\nCould he get inside the head of a girl who hated him?\nTo start, he had to remember what he’d done. He deserved that hurt.\nDid she? He closed his eyes, thinking what it must be like to see him\ncome slinking in each month. That man. That horrible man. Couldn’t he just\nlet her move on?\nHe’ll understand …\nWhat if he didn’t want to?\nDamn. Too late.\n“Hey, Call,” he said, opening his eyes and looking to Short Boring Guy.\n“I need you to set up a delivery for me. Some money to be paid to a young\nwoman and her family. Um, every month. She has her own kid now, and\nneeds the cash on time. It’s a meeting I’m supposed to do in person, but\nI’m … getting so busy. Yes, too busy, you see…”\n“Many of our clients have similar needs, Master Wayne,” Short Boring\nGuy said. “Give us the address and we’ll see it is handled with discretion.”\nWhy’d they say it that way? Well, regardless, Jaxy had been right. If he\nwas going to be dead, he could at least be the polite kind what didn’t try to\ncrawl out of the forest and eat you during thunderstorms.\nEven corpses needed standards.\n17\nSteris had been doing a good job lately, she thought, of understanding other\npeople. Once, she’d assumed they had the same worries she did, but hid\ntheir anxiety extremely well. As she’d grown older, she’d come to\nunderstand something more incredible. They just didn’t feel that anxiety.\nThey didn’t have a constant, hovering worry in the back of their brain,\nwhispering they’d forgotten something important. They didn’t spend hours\nthinking about the mistakes they’d made, and how they could have planned\nbetter. They lived in a perpetual state between blessed contentment and\nfrightening ignorance.\nThen she’d grown even older. She’d married Waxillium. She’d made\nfriends—real ones—and had come to see more clearly. Everyone saw the\nworld differently, and the Survivor had made people to complement one\nanother. Metal and alloy. A Push for every Pull.\nThe others responded to the explosion below with a strange excitement\nand eagerness, practically racing one another to the door. But what if the\nsteps were destabilized? Steris had a whole list of protocols to follow if\nthere was an explosion in the lab—she’d spent three nights developing it.\nShe loved them. And so she wanted to cry out a warning, hold them\nback safe, forbid them from risking themselves. She also knew how\nextreme she got sometimes. That was the biggest revelation of recent years\n—helped by discussions with the women of her book group. Some of her\npreparations went beyond helpful. Understanding that line was vital to\nunderstanding herself."

Understanding that line was vital to\nunderstanding herself.\nAnd she had to admit, today the others showed some wisdom. They let\nVenDell go first, at her suggestion, since a fall wouldn’t hurt him. Wax went\nnext, since he could more or less fly if the steps collapsed. They hesitated at\nthe bottom of the stairs—in case anything further was going to blow—\nbefore they opened the reinforced door.\n“Wait!” Steris said, then dug in her handbag. “Masks.”\nShe distributed the cloth masks to everyone, even Allik, since a wooden\none wouldn’t filter the air for him. They took the masks absently, or maybe\neven with a bit of an eye roll. All except Wax, who smiled at her as he put\nhis on.\nHe liked her preparations. He found it endearing. But beyond that, he\nappreciated it. He thought she was useful, not persnickety.\n“Anything on your watch list for explosions?” he asked.\nShe felt warm as she dug out her book of home emergencies. Yes, she\nknew she could be extreme. At the same time, making these was\ntherapeutic. Her fears eased once she wrote them down. If she’d thought of\nsomething, catalogued it and considered it, then it stopped having power\nover her—she had power over it.\n“Acids on the floor,” she noted. “Those could mix to produce poisonous\nfumes. Glass shards. Secondary explosions—particularly from exposed\nharmonium. Those are my big fears.”\nHe considered. “Marasi,” he said as she pushed open the door, “I was\ntesting with hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids.”\n“Which means?”\n“Chlorine gas,” he said.\nVenDell grabbed Marasi’s arm. Kandra had a thing about acids.\nTo Steris’s surprise, they listened to her. Since the powerful ventilators\ninstalled in the basement weren’t working, they let her fetch a room fan and\nset it up. Then they all returned up the steps and stood outside the mansion\nto allow the place to ventilate. When they went back down, everyone wore\ntheir masks without complaint and let her test the air with a kit. From there,\nthey were careful where they stepped as they inspected the room.\nThe door to the safe box had taken a little jaunt across the room, and\nwas now embedded deep into the thick concrete of the far wall. The steel of\nthe box itself had been mangled beyond repair. And the rest of the room …\nWell, it appeared that she’d have to put in an order for a new\nspectroscope. And a centrifuge. And some more flasks. And … um … new\nwalls …\nShe resisted her urge to begin sweeping the glass to avert the hazard of\nstepping on it. Instead she stuck near to Waxillium. He might discover\nsomething interesting.\n“Rusts,” he said, walking over to the remnants of the safe box. “This\nthing survived harmonium detonations of up to three ounces. I used less\nthan a tenth of that in this experiment.”\nHe reached for the top of what remained of the box.\nSteris wagged a glove in front of him.\n“Right,” he said, slipping it on, then feeling around the top of the broken"

His hand came away dusted with some black shavings—a fine\nmetal powder. VenDell walked up beside them. Marasi was inspecting the\nsafe box’s door, while Allik had fetched a broom from above and was\nsweeping up the glass.\nSteris had already liked him, of course, primarily because of how he\ntreated her sister. But in that moment, her estimation of him went up\nanother notch.\n“We need to test these shavings,” Wax said. “But … I don’t think this is\neither atium or lerasium. It looks like remnants of iron from the\nequipment.”\nSteris gathered them in some specimen pouches anyway. Waxillium\nleaned into the broken box on the wall, then used a small file from his\npocket to harvest something smoldering inside.\n“Harmonium,” he said as Steris dug out an extra vial of oil for him to\nput it into. “Plastered across the back of the box. I … think the experiment\nfailed. It didn’t divide.”\n“Actually,” VenDell said, “I think you managed something far, far more\ndangerous.” He took out a little notebook. “How much harmonium did you\nuse in here? A few grams?”\n“Around half a gram.”\n“This explosive force…” VenDell said. “This level of destruction …\nfrom such a small sample. It’s possible, but only if…”\n“What?” Wax said.\n“This explosion was not caused by the division of the metals,” VenDell\nsaid. “This level of energy release could happen only if some of the\nInvestiture or the matter itself was transformed into energy.”\nHe seemed to notice their confusion, so he continued. “I believe I’ve\nlectured you at length about the nature of Investiture. It is a particular study\nof mine. Along with my foremost expertise on skulls…”\n“Not for sale,” Wax reminded him.\n“Mine is,” Steris said.\nBoth looked at her.\n“Why would I need it when I’m dead?” she asked. “Seems much better\nto have the money now.”\n“As I always say,” VenDell replied. “Your impermanence is outlived by\nthe beautiful internal shells you create—like sand medallions from the\nocean, so are the bones of the human being. A lasting testimony of your\npresence on Scadrial. We shall discuss the terms of your sale at a later date,\nLady Ladrian.\n“For now, let me be brief. Everything in the cosmere is made up of one\nof three essences. The first is matter: the physical substances around you.\nFormed of axi, the smallest possible thing we know.”\n“There are things that … aren’t matter?” Steris asked.\n“Of course,” he said. “There’s energy.” He waved to the ceiling, where\ntwo of the room’s recessed and reinforced lights were still working.\n“Electricity, heat, light … Your kind has been harnessing it quite well lately.\nGood for you.

        "text": "Good for you. Very modern.”\n“And the third?” Wax asked.\n“Investiture,” VenDell said. “The essence of the gods. Everything has an\nInvested component, normally inaccessible without certain abilities. When\nyou burn metals, Lord Ladrian, you pull Investiture directly from the\nSpiritual Realm and use it to do work. Much like energy does work in those\nlights. But here is the key idea: Investiture, matter, and energy are all the\nsame, fundamentally.”\n“I … felt that, once,” Waxillium said, expression distant. “When I held\nthe Bands. That all things were one substance.”\n“Indeed!” VenDell replied. “And states can change from one to the\nother. Energy can become Investiture. This is the soul of Feruchemy.\nInvestiture can become matter. That is where harmonium comes from. And\nmatter can become energy.”\n“And an example of that is…” Steris said.\nVenDell nodded to the destroyed room. “We just witnessed it, I believe.\nThere is an incredible amount of energy trapped inside matter. You\nmanaged to release some of it—only a small amount of what you put in that\nbox, but still. If you found a way to release its full potential … Well,\nHarmony says the destructive power of it frightens him. Deeply.”\n“It should,” Waxillium said. “Because this was easy to accomplish. Far\ntoo easy.”\n“Well,” VenDell said, “it does require two very rare substances. And a\ngreat deal of energy, correct?”\n“A great deal,” he admitted. “For so small a sample. It would take quite\na bit of electricity to scale this up. But the destructive potential…”\n“Agreed.” VenDell’s skin had gone … not just pale, but actually\ntranslucent. “I … should report this. If you don’t mind, I’ll be upstairs\ncommuning with Harmony. Excuse me.”\nWaxillium shot Steris a look. “Worst case?” he asked.\nShe considered. What was the worst thing that could happen? It seemed\nobvious to her.\n“What if the Set already knows about this?” she asked. “Marasi said the\ndying man mentioned returning ash to the Basin. Maybe they plan to use\nbombs?”\nWax nodded, grim. He’d considered the same thing.\n“If the Set has discovered this interaction,” she said, “then it was likely\nby accident—or through an experiment like ours. There might be a record\nof it.”\n“We could search for unexplained explosions in the Outer Cities,” Wax\nsaid. “Smart. Ashes … What if an explosive like this were placed in one of\nthe old Ashmounts? Could they be restarted?”\n“That sounds appropriately terrifying,” Steris said, feeling a deep\nnausea. How had she never considered that possibility? Looked like she had\nsome planning to worry about. But first things first. “I’ll order broadsheets\nfrom the Outer Cities from the library and have them delivered to the\npenthouse. We can start there.”\nWax nodded. “With Marasi’s authority, you should be able to access the\nconstabulary records too.”\nIt was an excellent suggestion.

It had been … pleasant spending more\ntime with her lately. Their childhood hadn’t always encouraged sisterly\naffection. Their father—who was now retired to a country estate—had been\nembarrassed by Marasi’s illegitimate status. Steris had always worried\nMarasi would see it as a flaw in herself rather than in their father.\nMarasi seemed lost in thought, though what she found fascinating about\nthe broken door was beyond Steris. However, she stayed quiet, not wishing\nto interrupt. Silence didn’t bother Steris. It was a purely neutral experience.\n“The world is changing so fast,” Marasi finally whispered. “I’m barely\naccustomed to electric lights, let alone the airships. Then there’s this god …\nfrom another world. Now an explosive, a pinch of which can destroy a\nroom…”\n“I’m worried too,” Steris said. “I wish recent events had been possible\nto anticipate.”\n“Makes me wonder,” Marasi said, “why I’m spending my time on\nmurder cases and basic crimes. I realize they are important … but there are\npeople out there, Steris, who know about it all. Who are making moves that\nchange the fates of planets. They have no oversight, so far as I can tell.\nThey’re probably happy to see us chasing down ordinary criminals and\nleaving them alone.”\n“That’s why you hunt the Set,” Steris said, nodding. “Why you’ve\ndevoted so much to them, when most in the precinct think you’re going a\nlittle overboard.”\nMarasi chuckled. “Runs in the family, I guess.”\nSteris smiled, then felt foolish, as Marasi wouldn’t be able to see it\nbehind her face mask. Before Steris could say something, however,\nWaxillium blew himself up.\nIt was a much smaller detonation, fortunately, but it was forceful enough\nto throw him back and drop him to the ground. Steris ran over, worried—\nand found him dazed, but relatively unharmed. He took her arm as he sat\nup, shaking his head, his nice vest—a Versuli, no less—ripped and charred.\nThe apron she’d provided had protected it somewhat.\nHe brushed himself off. Though he didn’t like to admit it, he was getting\nolder. Being exploded when you were twenty was far different from being\nexploded when you were fifty.\n“So,” he said to her, “you mentioned something about secondary\nexplosions?”\n“It was on my list,” she whispered.\n“It’s all right,” he said, patting her hand. “I feel fine. I just did something\nstupid. I was gathering that harmonium plastered against the back of the\nsafe box. It’s too valuable to leave, and it must have reacted to the air or\nsome liquid left from an earlier experiment—”\nHe sneezed, then smiled at her reassuringly. His mask was nowhere to\nbe seen; it must have blown free in the explosion.\nShe hid her worry for him. Upon marrying Waxillium Ladrian, there\nwas one thing she had vowed to herself: She wouldn’t stop fretting about\nhim, but she would not prevent him from being the person he wanted to be."

She did not let\nthat control how she treated him. She would not be an obstacle. She loved\nhim too much for that. Instead she did her best to be part of his world. It\nwas far less frightening to be shot at than to sit at home wondering if he was\nbeing shot at.\nIt was to her eternal gratification that he, in turn, tried to be part of her\nworld. Taking more interest in politics. Spending time with her doing the\nfinances. They fit together, better than she’d ever dreamed they would. And\nshe still felt warm every time they touched.\n“Let’s get some tea,” Wax said, climbing to his feet with her help, “and\ntalk this over.”\n18\nMarasi settled into the couch, her ears ringing from the second explosion.\nAllik sat beside her, mask down—he tended to lower it when he chewed\ngum, as he was doing now. Chewing visibly was a cultural taboo for him.\nOdd. If there was one thing it should be normal to lift a mask for, it was\neating.\nStill, she wrapped her arm around his and let him rest his head on her\nshoulder. Rusts, it was nice to have him around full-time these days. The\nearly years of their relationship had been sixteen different varieties of\nfrustrating.\nWhile they waited for VenDell to finish his report to Harmony, Wax\ntalked about meeting the airship—and the new ambassador. She felt Allik\ngrow tense at the description.\n“This is Daal the Primary,” he explained to the rest of them. “He … is\nvery well respected by the Hosts.”\n“I could tell he was important politically,” Wax said.\n“No, Wax,” Marasi said. “Respected by the Hosts means he was\nsuccessful in war.”\n“So his arrival is a threat,” Steris said, nestled against Wax with her\nnotebook out, shoes off, her stockinged feet up to the side in a posture that\nactually seemed relaxed.\nShe’s changed so much, Marasi thought. She could remember a time\nwhen Steris wouldn’t have dared take her shoes off in company. She’d have\nsat with perfect posture, trying to ensure she was holding her tea and saucer\nlevel.\nMarasi had always loved her sister, even when resentment or forced\ndistance had interfered, but she’d never considered Steris pleasant. Not\nuntil these recent years. Part of that had been Steris changing, but another\npart had been realizing that she and Steris had always felt the same burdens\n—that sense of entrapment.\n“I wouldn’t say it’s a threat, Steris,” Allik said. “Not specifically. But if\nit is true, and the Consortium has finally been achieved—the five nations\nagreeing to put a common face northward—then this is … a symbol? They\nsend you their best. They want you to know it.”\n“Their best,” Wax said, “and most stern, I assume?

Is that still a sore issue?”\n“You have no idea,” Allik said. “Us agreeing to leave the Bands here,\nit’s like … like we left you with the body of our dead father, yah? A body\nthat is also a powerful weapon. Nobody liked that decision.\n“Sending him here, having him say he’ll get the Bands back … this is a\nsymbol, yah? A statement? They have been too lax with your people, and\nwish to indicate this laxness will end.” He shifted in place, then lifted his\nmask. “Sorry.”\n“You didn’t choose this, Allik.”\n“No,” he said. “But I didn’t not choose it.”\n“Dear, yes you did.” Marasi squeezed his arm. “You don’t have to take\nresponsibility for everything.”\nHe smiled at her, then put his mask down. Footsteps announced what\nshe thought was VenDell returning, but then Wayne burst into the sitting\nroom instead.\n“Hey!” he said. “You all got blowed up, and you didn’t wait for me?”\n“Waxillium got blowed up,” Steris said. “The rest of us merely\nwitnessed it. I think he did it on purpose to annoy you.”\n“I’m rusting sure,” Wayne said, narrowing his eyes at Wax. “You okay,\nmate?”\n“My ears are ringing,” Wax said, “and I’ve been reminded—quite\nprofoundly—that I’m at least two decades past prime exploding age. But I\nshould be fine.”\n“Glad you’re back, Wayne,” Marasi said, leaning forward. “Because we\nneed to plan.”\n“Yup, glad to be back,” he muttered. “Bein’ the fifth in a room is what\nevery feller wants, yes indeed.” He stomped over to the small serving table\nand poured a cup of tea—then left the cup on the table and settled down in\nan easy chair with the entire teapot. “What?” he said to everyone’s stares.\n“It’s almost gone, an’ I like the spigot part. Fun to drink outta.”\nHe demonstrated, which made Steris put her hand to her face. Marasi\nsighed, but didn’t say anything. If he was sitting then he was less likely to\nsteal something. She did check her pocketbook just in case.\n“All right,” she said to the group. “I have the bones of a plan—imitating\nthe Cycle to lead a local gang with a delivery scheduled to Bilming.”\nWax leaned forward. “Are we sure that interrogating the current captives\nwon’t be enough?”\n“They seemed like local flunkies,” Marasi said.\n“Who will barely know anything,” Wax agreed. “So you’ll want some\nconstables on your sting, ready to capture any Metalborn.”\n“I keep telling Reddi we need a specialist team,” Marasi said. “A squad\njust for dealing with Metalborn.

Merely touching it to harmonium is\ndangerous—but doing as you did, heating and stretching the harmonium\nfirst, created what he called ‘an Invested matter-energy transference.’\nThat’s … very bad.”\n“Did the news surprise him?” Wax asked. “Did Harmony seem shocked\nwe were able to do this? Or did he expect it?”\n“I couldn’t tell,” VenDell said. “He only said what I’ve relayed. More\nthan that … well, Harmony can be difficult to read. I suppose I don’t need\nto tell you that. Did he send you a note, Lord Waxillium?”\n“Yes,” Wax said. “I think he implied that I should make an earring out of\ntrellium.”\n“Whatever for?” Marasi said, frowning.\n“I don’t know,” Wax replied. “I think he’s trying to get me interested,\nsince I’ve ignored his last couple of invitations to commune with him.”\n“This time it’s different, Waxillium,” VenDell said softly. “This time …\nHarmony is frightened.”\nThe room fell silent, aside from Wayne slurping his tea through the\nnozzle of the teapot. Marasi thought she saw him adding something from\nhis flask to it, and she tried not to let that make her nauseous. Who spiked\ntea?\nHe’s hurting, she thought. The breakup is final. Rusts, despite everything\nelse going on, she decided to find time to take him out to that noodle place\nhe loved. Bring along a few of the other constables that he liked; remind\nhim he had friends.\n“My sting needs to happen soon,” she said to the room. “The book says\nthe next shipment to Bilming is to go out in three days, and I want to be\nready.”\n“It’s a good plan, Marasi,” Wax said. “Steris and I have something we\ncan work on while you’re planning.”\n“Talking to Harmony?” she asked.\n“Maybe,” he said, seeming distant. “I haven’t decided if I’m going to\nrespond to him yet.”\nCuriously, he didn’t indicate he wanted to be part of her mission. She’d\nhave let him in, but she couldn’t quite get a handle on Wax these days. The\nway he’d hung those Roughs coats in the entryway had an air of finality,\nlike a shrine to his old life. That said, when his deputized status had come\nup for renewal last year, he’d asked Reddi to maintain his position.\nWax glanced at Steris, who was leaning against him as she scribbled\nnotes. “We thought of something earlier,” he said to Marasi. “It’s vital that\nwe know if the Set has discovered the explosive potential of mixing\nharmonium and trellium. We’re going to do research to see what we can"

We’re going to do research to see what we can\nfind.”\n“Sounds good,” Marasi said, nodding.\nWell, that confirmed it. A few years ago, she might have been happy to\nhear he was staying out of her investigation, but she’d quashed that feeling.\nShe was proud of not letting his shadow—long though it was—blot out her\naccomplishments. Besides, she’d had her chance to become the hero in\nWax’s place—she’d held the Bands of Mourning herself before turning\nthem over to Wax. That simply wasn’t who she was.\nSo today, she was sad to hear he wouldn’t join her. Even worried, as she\nrealized she’d assumed he would be there on this one. If she actually had a\nchance at high-level members of the Set … well, this could finally break the\ncase open. And lead to answers.\nBut … she couldn’t force him. Shouldn’t force him. If he wasn’t feeling\nas spry as he once had, then who was she to object?\n“I’ll go do some more listenin’ to those fellows in prison,” Wayne said.\n“VenDell, you want to come with? Maybe I could give you tips on your\naccent?”\n“Master Wayne,” he said, “I am an immortal kandra with hundreds of\nyears’ experience doing impersonations.”\n“And you always sound snide and upper class,” Wayne said, “in every\nbody I’ve seen you use. So … want some tips or not, mate?”\n“I…” He sighed. “Harmony did directly order me to be about this. Ugh.\nField work is so distasteful. But I suppose I can’t say no.”\nMarasi glanced at Wax, who had settled back on the couch, thoughtful.\nHolding the envelope that Harmony had sent him.\n“All right then,” she said. “Let’s get to it.”\n19\nThree days later, Wax stood in his penthouse study, looking west toward\nBilming. There was no mist tonight. Seemed like weeks since he’d seen\nany.\nPreparations had gone well for Marasi’s sting. The notebook had clear\ninstructions on how to deliver the goods. Using intel from interrogations,\nMarasi had located the very trucks the captives had been planning to use.\nShe had the exact outfits of the captives, and VenDell was playing the role\nof their leader. Wayne, in one of his finest disguises, was at his side to help\nsell the role. Even the boxes of goods were real.\nThey would leave sometime tonight. Wax wouldn’t go to see them off,\nof course. He could be conspicuous, and Marasi had taken every\nconceivable step to make sure the enemy didn’t spot the subterfuge.\nThey’ll be safe, he told himself. Their disguises are excellent, and she’s\nextremely capable.\nThis was the Basin, not some wayward town in the Roughs. Marasi had\naccess to the finest constables in the city, along with resources in\nabundance.

She didn’t need an old Coinshot with an unloaded pistol who\nstill felt the ache of having foolishly exploded his laboratory a few days\nago.\nStill, Wax lingered, looking through the wide picture windows of his\nsmall penthouse study. It had been exciting, these last years, watching the\ncity grow electrified. He had evanotypes of the process, taken every few\nmonths from this high perspective. A grid of lights and streets, homes\nglowing with the calm light of progress, each adding another shimmering\nstar to the Elendel constellation. Would the lights spread so far that\neventually there wouldn’t be any darkness at all?\nSteris slipped over, then handed him a cup of tea. “With willow\npowder,” she whispered. “For your aches.”\n“You think of everything,” he said, taking a sip. “How are the kids?”\n“Sleeping,” she said. “We should be fine to go back to work.”\nTogether they walked back into the living room, where practically every\nsurface had been commandeered to hold stacks of broadsheets. They could\nhave hired researchers to pick through it all, but why give someone else the\nfun?\nAnd it was fun. Not of the sort that Wax would once have enjoyed, but\nfun was as much about the company as the activity. They settled down\ntogether on the floor—all of the seats had papers on them—and continued\nreading. Searching for any mentions of explosions in cities across the Basin.\nTo pass the time, they also looked for anything amusing.\n“‘Pickled Pachyderm Plays Piano,’” Steris said, holding one up. “Why\ndo they always pick ‘pachyderm’ for these alliterative sentences?”\n“Because it’s a funny word?” Wax said, with a smile. “What’s it pickled\nin?”\n“Apparently it was sitting in a small swimming pool,” Steris said. “I\nthink that’s a stretch.”\nHe held up his own headline. “‘Child Eats Tar. Mother Feeds Rat As\nAntidote.’”\n“Oh, that can’t be real,” she said, taking the broadsheet from him. But it\nwas a real story—and in a reputable paper as well. Turned out even the\nmost highbrow of sources weren’t above using a zinger to move copies on a\nslow news day. She grinned, setting it on her stack of amusing headlines.\nFor their true hunt, Steris had a system—because of course she did.\nThey read only headlines at first, quickly skimming sheets for certain words\nin bold or large print. Anything that looked promising went into its own\npile. But you didn’t read the story, not yet. You’d want to read all of those\ntogether, to compare one against another and further winnow.\nThey were almost done with the most recent batch of broadsheets,\ndelivered today. Wax enjoyed it, mostly for the time with his wife—though\nhe seemed to still be suffering the aftereffects of the explosion. His vision\nkept behaving oddly, distorting at times for just a second or two. And his\nmind kept playing tricks on him, making him think he glimpsed blue\nAllomantic lines without burning metals.\nHe set aside worries over his health, and certainly did not say anything.\nHe didn’t want to concern Steris.

He’d survived explosions before. His\nhand still ached from the mine detonation back in Dust’s Beach …\n“Here’s one,” Steris said, showing him a serious headline. “Explosion at\na railway station.”\nWax rubbed his chin as he read. “Sounds like a boiler malfunction. Not\nterribly suspicious.”\n“Perhaps it’s covering something up?”\nHe shook his head. Seemed like an odd place to be running metallurgic\nexperiments. Too many people nearby—but then again, he’d done his\nexperiments in the basement of a mansion. So who knew?\nSteris set it in the “maybe” pile, while he moved his current broadsheet\n—an account of a fire that was pretty obviously a lightning strike—into the\n“unlikely” pile. None of these felt right to him, which should have made\nhim happy. Perhaps their enemies hadn’t discovered the explosive\ninteraction between harmonium and trellium.\nUnfortunately, this sort of investigation could be frustrating for just that\nreason. He didn’t want to find proof, because it would confirm his fears. Yet\nif they turned up nothing, they’d never know if it was because no proof\nexisted, or because they had missed it.\n“‘Snake Sneaks Snoring Snails’?” Steris said, showing him one from her\namusing pile. “I have to admire them for committing to the gimmick.”\n“Do snakes eat snails?” he asked.\n“This one did, apparently.” She smiled, and Preservation, he loved that\nsmile. He found himself wishing this hunt were for lower stakes.\nAshes falling again, he thought, shivering. He’d often imagined what it\nwould have been like to live in the mythical days before the Catacendre.\nWhen the Ascendant Warrior and Wax’s own distant ancestor, the Counselor\nof Gods, had walked the land. When people had moved through stories like\nthe sun behind clouds on a mostly overcast day.\nIn those days, the world had been dying. Ash had been its skin, flaking\noff as it disintegrated …\nHe sighed, rubbing his eyes—seeing those odd flashes of blue.\nFortunately, the tea was beginning to work and his headache was at last\nretreating.\n“Wax?” Steris asked softly. “Do you wish you’d gone with Marasi and\nWayne?”\n“They’ll be fine,” he said. “They don’t need me.”\n“That isn’t what I asked, love,” she said softly.\nHe thought for a moment. Then shook his head. “I don’t, Steris. I\ngenuinely don’t. I realized it the other day. I’m … past that stage of my life.\nI really feel like I’m done.”\nExcept for one thing. The fact that his sister was involved. Still out\nthere. Dangerous.\nMost families had skeletons in the closet. And most of those were\nsensible enough to stay dead. His might be threatening the entire Basin.\nAsh falling again …\nBut he did feel done. Ready to move on. So, he showed Steris an\naccount of a series of broken windows in the city of Demoux.

But maybe it was an indication of a sharp pressure\nchange, like an explosion?\nThey put it in the “unlikely” pile. Unfortunately, after an hour of this,\nthey neared the end of the stacks with no solid leads. Just a lot of very\nunlikely possibilities.\nSteris watched him as she moved another broadsheet to the unlikely\npile. He knew what she was thinking, but she didn’t prod him.\n“There is one thing,” he admitted to her. “My sister. I should be the one\nto deal with her. But I have important work to do here in Elendel. Besides,\nI’m not that man anymore.”\n“Do you have to be that man or this man?” she asked.\n“I have to make choices. Everyone does.”\n“And what about when you initially came back to Elendel?” she asked.\n“When you decided to hang up your guns the first time?”\n“This is different,” he explained. “Back then I was running from myself.\nI stopped running six years ago, in the mountains, Steris. This is what I\nwant. This is who I want to be. I’m happy here.”\nShe leaned into him, a steady warmth at his side. “So long as you\nknow,” she whispered, “that you don’t have to be one or the other. You\ndon’t have to see yourself as two men, Wax, with two different lives. Those\nmen are the same person. And he’s the one I love.”\nHe thought on that, considering those days when he’d come back to\nElendel—determined to put his past in the Roughs behind him. Because it\nwas what he thought he should do. And … well, because a part of him had\nbeen broken. A gouge that had eventually been ripped back open by\nLessie’s return.\nLying near death on a frozen mountaintop to the south had changed his\nperspective. When he’d returned to Elendel, he’d been able to live again.\nGrowing, changing. And yet … did that mean the past him was no longer\nhim? Were the inner rings in a tree less a part of it just because they were no\nlonger exposed to the air?\n“I’m worried about them,” he admitted to Steris. “And … I’m worried\nabout the safety of the Basin. I don’t want to act like I don’t trust Marasi\nand Wayne. But…” He reached into his pocket and took out the envelope\nwith the earring. Which he still hadn’t used. “Last year, when VenDell\noffered me a mission, it didn’t have the same urgency. The same disquiet\nabout it. I’m afraid that whatever is happening now has grown too big to\nignore. Too dangerous to be stopped by detective work or police\nintervention, no matter how competent.”\n“Another god,” Steris whispered.\nHe took out a second envelope. “I had this made,” he said, shaking\nsomething out of it. Another earring. With a red tinge to the metal. It was\nnothing more than a stud, with the only trellium portion the bar in the\nmiddle, as the metal couldn’t be melted to be forged.\n“When I gave the trellium spike to the university for study,” he"

Because Harmony\nsuggested I’d need it.”\n“Do you believe what Marasi said? About another ashfall? The return of\nthose … dark days?”\n“I don’t know,” he said. “But VenDell says Harmony is afraid. And that\nhas me terrified.”\nSteris tapped her finger on the stack of broadsheets in her lap. “Let’s\nidentify our worst-case scenario. Consider: What’s the worst thing you can\nimagine, in regards to our current hunt?”\n“My worst fear?” he said, thinking. “It’s that we’re years behind. That\nthe Set has known about this interaction between harmonium and trellium\nfor a great deal longer than we assume—maybe since that first Malwish\nairship crashed here. My fear is that the Set is not beginning a plan. My fear\nis that we’re in the end stages of said plan.”\n“Is there anything we could search for to prove this?” Steris asked.\nWax stood up, surveying the room full of broadsheets, each stack from a\ndifferent city. “Rusts,” he said. “We shouldn’t be searching for accidental\nexplosions. We should be searching for proof of intentional ones. And\nwe’re looking at too recent a batch of papers—if it happened, it could be\nfive or six years old by now.” He paused. “They’d want to test. It wouldn’t\nbe one explosion long ago. It would be a series of them … hidden\nsomehow … because if they have this weapon, they’ll want to develop it.\nImprove it.”\n“How?” Steris asked. “Should we search for records of harmonium\nbusts?”\n“I doubt that would show up in the broadsheets,” Wax said, turning\naround the room. “The Set is good at hiding its resource movement,\nespecially of contraband. Marasi’s investigation proves that.”\nSo what? Was there any way to find what he wanted? Evidence of\ntests … of explosions they’d keep hidden …\n“Earthquakes,” Wax whispered.\n“What was that?”\n“Earthquakes,” he said, kneeling beside Steris. “They would test\nexplosions underground, in the caverns. Where they’d be contained and\nhidden. But they can’t fool the seismographs.”\nThey dug into the headlines again—but this time with a different set of\ncriteria. And admittedly, Wax broke format a little, peeking at the contents\nof the stories rather than just looking for headlines. Steris poked him in the\nside if he spent too long doing this, but he was curious. And excited.\nThe answers had to be in here somewhere.\nThe search took a solid three hours of work. But as midnight passed,\nWax found it. A series of articles from an Elendel broadsheet about\nsomething happening in Bilming.\n“A subway?” Steris asked, frowning.\n“Reports,” Wax explained, “of odd earthquakes in the city, starting years\nago. Officials quickly explained that Bilming had decided to build a\nsubterranean rail line like Elendel.”\n“That could be valid,” Steris said, reading another broadsheet expanding"

        "text": "ago. Officials quickly explained that Bilming had decided to build a\nsubterranean rail line like Elendel.”\n“That could be valid,” Steris said, reading another broadsheet expanding\non the story. “We used explosives to blast away rock and build the subway.”\n“But why would Bilming need a subway? They have that elevated rail\nthey’re so proud of. They love showing it off. Plus, these explosions have\nbeen going for four and a half years—and they don’t have a single subway\nline up and running.”\n“Suspicious,” Steris said, scanning the next article. “Very suspicious. A\nnew initiative started seven months ago … Reports of buildings being\nrattled by large-scale detonations … They were detected all the way here in\nElendel.”\n“They’re calling it a financial scandal, with construction companies\nleeching away funds. But it’s obviously more.”\nSteris nodded vigorously. The broadsheet that had uncovered this wasn’t\nthe most reputable source—it was the latest one to carry that fool Jak’s\noutlandish stories—but there was something here, as confirmed by several\nother broadsheets, now that they knew what they were looking for.\nRusts, he thought. The Set were testing beneath populated areas? Why?\nWas that just where they could find the cavern space? This might be even\nbigger than he’d feared. Hadn’t Bilming been building a navy?\nYes. Other articles talked about it. Ostensibly, the Bilming shipyards\nwere creating a defense force for the Basin, in case of attack from the\nSouth. But they’d started before the arrival of the first Malwish airships—\nand they certainly liked to show off the capabilities of their guns.\nSupposedly these ships were under Elendel’s control. No one actually\nbelieved that though.\n“Wax…” Steris said. “That list of shipments in Marasi’s book. Where\nthey were checking to see how tight customs was. How hard it would be to\nsmuggle something into Elendel…”\nA chill washed through Wax. What would they want to smuggle into\nElendel?\nA bomb.\n“It looked like they were checking different cargo sizes,” he said. “And\nhow likely they were to be inspected when brought in via train or truck.”\n“And how big would this bomb be?” Steris said. “Theoretically.”\n“It’s the generator that would be big,” Wax explained. “If it works\naccording to the mechanics we discovered, then they’d need a great deal of\npower. More than the simple lines to homes can carry, or even the lines to\nindustrial locations. They’d likely have to build a very large housing for the\ndevice.”\n“Which explains why they were checking which sizes arouse suspicion\nand which don’t. Wax, if you’re right, then the broadsheets indicate they’ve\nbeen testing this for more than four years. Successfully. They might have\nthe bomb already. They’re just…”\n“… looking for a way to get it into the city.”\nRusts. He looked to the side table, and the envelopes. Then, finally, he\nslipped the first earring out—the one Harmony had sent him. It had been six\nyears. He’d grown increasingly reticent to have anything to do with\nHarmony. He no longer hated God, but still …\nHe looked to Steris, who nodded. So he put the earring in."

So he put the earring in.\nAnd was suddenly in another place.\nFloating, seeing the entire world before him, and the dark vastness\nbeyond. He spent a moment disoriented, though his feet felt like they were\non solid ground. It was unnerving.\nThis didn’t normally happen when he used an earring. But he had been\nhere once before. On that frozen mountaintop.\nHarmony stood in the distance. A serene figure in traditional Terris\nrobes. Kindly eyes. Hesitant at first, Wax walked across the invisible floor\ntoward Harmony. If he let his eyes unfocus, Harmony seemed as vast as the\ncosmere—two sweeping wings. One white, one black. Spinning together in\nthe middle, the edges extending to infinity.\nAt the heart of it was that figure. Terris. Head shaved smooth. Rounded\nfeatures, with an elongated face. The face of a legend, standing with hands\nclasped behind his back. Looking worried.\n“Last time I was here,” Wax noted, “I was dead.”\n“Dying,” Harmony said. “On the very cusp of death. Sometimes I think\nthat’s where I reside. Always there, like a coin balanced on edge … a gulf\non either side…”\n“Where is the redness I saw last time?” Wax asked, nodding to the\nplanet. Six years ago a red haze had been coming over the planet, as if to\nswallow it. “Did you drive it off?”\n“No,” Harmony said softly. “It Invested the planet. Invested … me.\nWhat you saw was a shroud, Waxillium. I responded too slowly. It is … a\nfailing that grows more dangerous in me. By the time I realized what was\nhappening, that shroud had come over me. It doesn’t hurt, it merely\ndampens my ability to see.”\n“You mean…”\n“I don’t know what’s happening,” Harmony said softly, staring down at\nthe planet. “What is Trell doing? What are they planning? They put that\nhaze up as a kind of smoke screen. When I attacked it, the haze infected my\nability to see the future. Temporarily. I will be rid of it in a few years. That’s\nnothing on the timescale of gods. And yet…”\n“And yet, the danger is right now.”\n“Yes,” Harmony said. “Like a nearsighted person, I can see the danger\nnow that it has come very close.” He hesitated, then looked to Wax. “I can\nsee you, hear you. We are Connected. And so, I know what you’ve\ndiscovered. I thought I had more time. I realize only now that I have been\nmoving too slowly. Yet again, too slowly…”\nWax considered that, gave it due weight. These weren’t matters or\nconcepts one took lightly. God blinded. All of them years behind the enemy.\nA bomb being developed and a search for a way into the heart of his city.\nOne question rose to the surface. An old lawman’s adage.

Autonomy carries power like my own, a dangerous force\nfor manipulating the very nature of reality and existence. Though\nAutonomy is held by a woman named Bavadin, her many different faces—\nor avatars—act with independence. Trell, a male god from the ancient\nrecords, can be considered one of these.”\nWax blinked.\n“You were not expecting so straightforward an answer?” Harmony\nasked.\n“I’ve not always gotten them in the past.”\n“I’m trying to do better.”\nThat was … somehow as unnerving as hearing that Harmony had been\nblinded. God should not have to get better.\n“You rarely get to speak to Autonomy herself,” Harmony continued. “As\nI’ve come to find, she speaks through avatars. Sometimes pieces of herself\nthat she’s allowed to gain a semblance of self-awareness, sometimes\nthrough chosen people she has given a portion of her power.\n“Autonomy decided to destroy our world, as it is a dangerous threat to\nher. But I believe she has been persuaded to let it persist, so long as it can\nbe … controlled. Autonomy offered me an ultimatum last year, as my\nblinding was taking effect and when she assumed I would be the most\ndesperate. She demanded I give this world to her, then move to another.\n“I rejected the demand—and one of the last things I saw was the person\nAutonomy has chosen. The same one who persuaded her that this world had\nvalue, and who presented a plan for its domination.”\n“My sister?”\nHarmony nodded. “The leader of the Set. Invested by Autonomy. Avatar\nof a god on this world.”\nWax exhaled softly. Telsin.\nThinking of her brought an immediate stab of betrayal. He remembered\nexactly how it had felt to realize, in one terrible moment, that she would\nshoot him. Despite his love, his attempts to help her, she’d been working\nagainst him all along.\nThat pain was acute, despite the years. And he realized that he hadn’t\nleft everything about his past behind. A thread lingered, a raw nerve\nexposed to the air.\nThinking of Telsin with the power of a deity in her hands … Rusts.\nShe’d spent her youth manipulating people. Getting her way. Telsin\nalways got her way. It had been bad enough when she’d been able to\npersuade the adults she was sweet, obedient, and perfect—all the while\nsneaking out with her friends. It had become dangerous when she’d begun\nplaying much higher-stakes games with the city’s elite. And it had become\ndeadly when she’d discovered the Set and started shaping world politics.\nWhat would she do with this?\n“You’re only now telling me?” Wax demanded.\n“I contacted you a year ago,” Harmony said, “when I was first blinded.\nYou … still did not want to speak with me.

Wax, I have tried to handle this in other ways. I have failed. And\nso, I come back to the one weapon I’ve always been able to rely upon.”\nWax took a deep breath. “Tell me what you know.”\n“Are you agreeing?”\n“First tell me what you know. About my sister’s plans, about this god.\nAnything relevant.”\n“I’ve shared most of it,” Harmony said. “You should know, perhaps, that\neach of these powers—these Shards—has what we call an Intent. A driving\nmotivation. I bear two: one driving me to preserve and protect, the other\ndriving me to destroy.\n“Autonomy is driven to divide off from the rest of us, go her own way.\nShe pushes her followers to prove themselves, and she rewards those who\nare bold, who survive against the odds. She respects big plans and big\naccomplishments. I presume this is why your sister has persuaded\nAutonomy not to destroy our planet outright. Or at least to delay doing so.”\n“Telsin is still planning something catastrophic,” Wax said. “She’s trying\nto destroy Elendel. But what does that get her? The other cities will revolt\nagainst such a terrible act of destruction; she can’t think they’ll follow her if\nshe kills so many.”\n“She’s desperate,” Harmony said. “Your sister has set up in Bilming.\nYou’ll find her there, building a new empire. She must know that her god is\nstill eager to wage war on our people and annihilate them. So, she is trying\nwhat she can. If Telsin destroys Elendel, she can try to take control of the\nBasin and prove to Trell that she is capable of ruling this planet. I do not\nknow if this is her true motive, but it is what seems most likely.” Harmony\nglanced to him. “I’m sorry. I had not realized she would go this far.”\nWax looked away, but it was difficult to blame Harmony. Wax himself\nhad been blind to Telsin for years—and he didn’t have the excuse of a\ndivine shroud. He’d always assumed that he of all people knew the real her.\nUntil he’d found himself just another pawn in her games, shown a false\nface. Made to feel an idiot. Why had he thought she would play everyone\nexcept him?\nBecause a part of him had loved his sister. Right up until the moment\nwhen she’d pulled the trigger and he’d known the truth. Family was nothing\nto her but a powerful cord with which to bind and manipulate."

        "text": "Because a part of him had loved his sister. Right up until the moment\nwhen she’d pulled the trigger and he’d known the truth. Family was nothing\nto her but a powerful cord with which to bind and manipulate.\n“If what you have discovered is true,” Harmony said, “we might not\nhave much time for me to free myself from my shroud. Autonomy\nmobilizes an army from offworld to invade and destroy everyone on this\nplanet. Telsin moves to circumvent that. Both plans are catastrophic to us,\nand both are in motion.”\nDamn. Wax took a deep breath. “You had me make a second earring.\nThat’s what finally convinced me to talk to you. Why?”\n“I hoped that would work,” Harmony said, a hint of a smile on his lips.\n“A good mystery is the best invitation.”\n“And? What do I do with it?”\n“When Vin, the Ascendant Warrior, was resisting Ruin, she didn’t\nrealize that the little earring she wore linked her to him. It let him get inside\nher head, speak with her. Connect to her.” He nodded to Wax’s earring.\n“With a trellium spike, you will be Connected to Trell’s avatar—much as\nyou now are to me. She will be able to sense you, and you her.”\n“I don’t know if that’s a good idea,” Wax said, shaking his head.\n“Whenever the two of us meet, she gets the better of me. I shouldn’t try to\nplay her games.”\nHarmony smiled. A faint smile, from one too burdened to be eager about\nthe emotion. He actually seemed to do it on purpose, with effort. “As you\nwish. It is a tool for you to use. I’ve lost games over and over against\nAutonomy, but I still have help I can send you. Some do not realize I was\nbehind their mobilization. Yet I did not know the urgency of our task. I did\nnot know their bomb might be ready. I am caught flat-footed. That was their\ngoal, I think. So I must ask. Will you be my sword again, Waxillium?”\n“It is absolutely necessary?”\n“That depends,” he said, “on how you feel about the prospect of your\nsister taking my place as this planet’s steward.”\n“That’s … actually a possibility?”\n“Yes.”\n“Damn.”\n“Disrupt Telsin’s plan, and Autonomy will abandon her. That is our best\nbet.”\n“And the army Autonomy is bringing?”\n“We will have to hope we have time to stop them after your sister’s plan\nis subverted.”\nIt didn’t sound like much of a strategy. He looked to Harmony, and saw\nsomething different this time. Not the vastness of the powers, or even the\nfigure of legend. But a man. Thrust into a war that none of them had been\nready for, playing catch-up to learn powers that others had presumably\nspent millennia mastering.\nHe’s doing his best, Wax thought. And struggling to avoid being crushed\nby the opposing powers he holds. He needs help, and I’m all there is.\nWhen Wax had run to the Roughs, it had been to escape—but he’d\nstayed because people needed him.\nHe’d found peace in Elendel. He wouldn’t return to the field because he\nwanted it or needed it. This time, he would go because he was needed."

This time, he would go because he was needed.\n“Final time?” Wax said.\n“I promise,” Harmony said. “Final time.”\n“All right,” Wax said, and felt a weight settle onto him. “I’ll stop Telsin.\nBut you’re going to have to deal with this Autonomy.”\n“Buy me time,” Harmony said. “Time to recover. Time to build greater\nalliances in the years to come, so we can face her as a unified planet.”\n“I still don’t know how bombing Elendel gets Telsin what she wants,”\nhe said. “It’s too extreme. She’s more rational than that. She’s got to be\nplanning to threaten us with it until we bend. Maybe she intends to … I\ndon’t know, detonate one in an Ashmount to cow us?”\n“Perhaps. I do not know her ultimate plan. I’m sorry.”\nA mystery then. With terrible stakes. Wax met Harmony’s eyes. “Is there\nanything you’re not telling me?”\n“Many things,” Harmony admitted.\n“Will any of them hurt, like what happened with Lessie?”\n“Not on purpose,” Harmony said. “But I cannot promise you will\nsurvive this. Or that if you do, it will be without pain. I can’t promise much\nthese days.”\nWax made a fist.\n“Do you trust me, Waxillium?” God asked.\n“No,” Wax said honestly. “But I trust her less. I’ve already said that I’ll\nhelp. But I’m not only a sword, Harmony. I’m a lawman too. I’ll find out\nwhat Telsin is doing. I’ll answer the questions you cannot. I’ll stop her that\nway.”\n“Thank you.”\nIn a heartbeat, Wax was back in his penthouse. He’d never left, not\nphysically. Steris knelt beside him, worried.\n“He’s been blinded,” Wax said to her. “He didn’t realize how urgent the\nproblem was, and he’s asked me to help. To intervene, and stop my sister.”\nHe took her by the arm. “I’m sorry. I need to go. I know you’ll worry about\nme.”\n“Of course I will,” she said. “But do you think I won’t worry if you\nstay? If you’re right about all of this…” She stood up. “It’s not me or them,\nWax. It’s not politics or Allomancy. It’s not me or Lessie. It’s never been\neither/or. That part of your life isn’t over merely because you didn’t need it\nfor a while. You need it now. We all do.”\nHe stood up beside her. “I’ll need to fetch my coat and my guns from\nthe mansion.”\n“I have them here,” she said, moving some stacks of broadsheets to\nuncover a cleaner’s bag—from which she removed his mistcoat.\n“I should have guessed that you’d have it laundered,” he said. “Thank\nyou for—”\nThere was a knock at the front door.

Wax walked to check, and outside—in the small hallway that\nled to the elevator foyer—he found a wrapped package.\nHe closed the door and showed the package to Steris. When unwrapped,\nit revealed a row of sixteen vials with—it appeared—a solution of alcohol\nand metal flakes inside. The last had a red-painted cork and a note. Use the\nothers instead of your normal vials. Use the last in an emergency only.\nWax took these solemnly. Then, from the locked cabinet by the wall, he\nremoved his strongbox—and from that two fully aluminum pistols, among\nRanette’s finest creations. Vindication II and the Steel Survivor.\nThe first was a powerful, large-caliber gun designed to hold hazekiller\nrounds in two extra chambers. Those rounds were oversized, the bullets\ndesigned with a secondary explosion for dealing with Hemalurgists. Ranette\nhad come up with them to forcibly eject a spike from a person’s body at\nclose range. The second gun was a sleek mid-caliber pistol with an extra-\nlong barrel for firing precision rounds. He generally loaded it with ordinary\nbullets that could be Pushed.\nThey slid into holsters that up until recently had held his unloaded guns.\nThere was more in the box too. A gun bag, two feet long, holding something\nextra special, in several pieces that could be assembled. Ranette’s most\ndeadly design. He hesitated as he put a hand on it. Inside was a weapon not\nfor a lawman, but for a soldier. Intent on destruction.\nHe put it back in the gun box. He wasn’t going to need that. He was a\nlawman.\nSteris bustled over with his large shoulder bag, extra wide and made of\nthick leather, for supplies. She packed his ammunition and extra metal vials\n—and, knowing her, a lunch—as he hurriedly gathered a few other things\nhe thought he might need from the study. This included a belt with a pouch\nlined in aluminum, for holding metal vials. He could clip it closed, and the\nglass vials inside would be untouchable to enemy Allomancers. Into this he\nloaded half of the vials Harmony had sent.\nWhen he returned, she held out his mistcoat for him. He took it in a two-\nhanded grip.\n“Steris,” he said, “the Senate … I can’t be in two places at once. Can\nyou talk to the governor? This is a bad time for me to leave, with the new\nambassador here. Hell … it might not be bad to prepare the governor for the\nworst, explaining about the potential for a bomb.”\n“I don’t know if he will listen,” Steris said. “The senators and the\ngovernor don’t even listen to you—they’ll outright ignore me.”\n“Still, we should try.”\n“We … could appoint someone to represent the house…”\n“Steris,” he said, “I stepped up to lead the house because of your dreams\nof what we could do. Your wonderful dreams. You saw in me someone who\ncould do what needed to be done, and you were right.” He took her gently\nby the shoulder. “I see in you the same person. A better one. I’ve been"

I’ve been\nworking on your ideas these last years. Your genius. You can lead as well as\nI can. Better, even.”\n“I’m not good with people,” she whispered. “I’ll ruin it. I’ve thought,\nand I’ve planned, and I always reach the same conclusion. I can’t be trusted\nwith something this important; we need someone more suitable.”\n“What if I think otherwise?” Wax said. “What if I think you’re\nabsolutely the best person to represent our house? War is building—and it’s\ngoing to get worse if I do uncover a conspiracy in Bilming. We need\nsomeone to stop the hotheads. Someone meticulous, who has considered all\nthe possibilities.”\n“I … I don’t know. If I can do it.”\n“I believe in you, Steris. I will appoint someone else if you want. But I\nthink you can do it best.”\nShe met his eyes. Then, hesitantly, she nodded.\n“Thank you,” he said.\n“If you really think this is best, then I will try. I am bad with people, but\nyou are good with them. So it stands to reason that perhaps you are right.\nAbout me.” She squeezed his arms. “Go. I will see to the Senate.\nSomehow.”\nHe kissed her, still holding the mistcoat in one hand, wrapping his other\narm around her. As he did, a small pair of hands gripped him and Steris\naround the legs.\n“Max!” Steris said, breaking the embrace and looking down. “Why\naren’t you in bed?”\n“Because I’m in here,” he said.\nShe lifted him up as Wax stepped back and threw on his coat, then slung\nhis heavy ammunition bag over his shoulder.\n“You need to go fight monsters now?” Max asked.\n“If I can find them,” Wax said.\n“You can,” Max said. “You’re the best detector that ever lived. Uncle\nWayne told me. He said you can find any treasure there ever was to be\nfound.”\n“I’ve already found the best treasures, Max,” Wax said, turning—\nmistcoat tassels rustling in that old familiar way. Like whispers speaking an\nancient tongue. “Now I just have to keep them safe.”\nHe threw open the balcony doors and launched out into the sky toward\nthe city of Bilming.

Initiated over four years ago with a bloated\nbudget that rusts the metals of every Bilming taxpayer, the subway was to\nprovide relief to the city’s traffic problems. While little progress has been\nseen on the underground rail, in the same amount of time, the Bilming\nTransportation Authority has added more lines to the raised rail and more\nlanes to the highways.

While Jak’s adventures\nwill continue in The Sentinel of Truth, “Handerwym Presents” will now be\nexclusive to our broadsheet in Bilming.\n“This was my intention all along,” said Jak to a crowd of eager fans, “to\ntrain dear Handerwym in the ways of greatness and then cut the apron\nstrings, push him from the nest, and watch him sink or swim. Besides, now\nthat I don’t have to pay him, I can focus my time and money on writing my\nmemoirs and exploring promising new forms of storytelling.

The woman wore her jacket with the collar\nup, a cap on her head to shadow her face. The team had been told to\nmaintain their disguises even while driving.\nWhen Marasi had dozed off, they’d been traveling through the bleak\ndarkness beyond Elendel. When she blinked awake, the sun was rising and\nthey were passing the Bilming suburbs. Marasi had never been to the city,\nthough it was only a few hours by train along the coast, but she had a good\ngrasp on the politics of why this city was so important.\nAs traffic into the capital had grown overwhelming, Bilming had\nbecome an essential port and dockyard.

        "text": "As traffic into the capital had grown overwhelming, Bilming had\nbecome an essential port and dockyard. Its seaside nature let it trade with\nother coastal towns, ignoring Elendel’s railway monopoly. In addition,\nBilming was a chief port for trade with the Southern Continent—where\nmuch commerce was being handled by traditional ocean shipping, not\nairship.\nThe discovery of those new lands had brought wealth into Bilming. And\nwealth meant power. Many in Elendel thought they had let the people of\nBilming grow too independent—and in recent years, it had become the one\ncity in the Basin that could legitimately rival Elendel.\nMany in the capital spoke of Bilming snidely, pretending it was a rural\noutpost of half-educated sailors and drunken dockworkers. Marasi knew\nbetter. This wasn’t a rural backwater; Bilming was a metropolis in the\nmaking.\nShe passed neatly laid-out suburbs—but even more swaths of land that\nhad been set aside to eventually be filled. Many developments were mid-\nconstruction, houses being built, each in a different style, no two roofs\nmatching one another. No two doorways in the same place. Yet there was a\nstrange symmetry to it. One she couldn’t quite pin down.\nIt was the same downtown, which—though still distant—she could see\nhad half-finished pillars of skyscrapers growing up like the mythical spires\nof Kredik Shaw. A dominant building at the direct center was furthest along.\nIt had to be a good seventy or eighty stories high, rivaling the tallest\nbuildings in Elendel.\nEach of the buildings—particularly the one at the center—had a strange\naesthetic that mixed the feel of a fortress with modern sleek lines and steel\nfinishings. As they drove closer, the roadway passed under a large elevated\nrailway that ran in a circle around the city. Some sections were unfinished,\nbut big swaths of it were already in operation.\nEverything had a metallic feel to it, like burnished steel, enhanced by\nthe skeletons of buildings rising up, their girders exposed. The finished\nbuildings had metal roofs or siding—not always polished, and often with a\npatina. The overall effect gave the great variety of building shapes a\ncohesive theme.\nShe was impressed. Even half-finished, this was a city with a plan. The\ndesign screamed of industry, forward thinking, and accomplishment. They\npassed numerous billboards proclaiming the virtues of self-reliance and\nsovereignty. You didn’t have to read far between the lines to see the tone\nthose were setting. Independence from Elendel.\n“You ever notice,” her driver said, “how kids always draw houses the\nsame way?”\nMarasi frowned, glancing at her. The woman’s voice was on the deeper\nside, but Marasi couldn’t make out much about her. Marasi had chosen her\ntruck at random, picking one that had boxes in the back, not constables—\nhoping that would help her sleep.\n“I can’t say that I’ve noticed,” Marasi said.\n“It’s strange,” the driver continued. “You can imagine the shape, of\ncourse. Square box. Triangular roof. Door right in the center. Two windows.\nOften a chimney, even though fewer and fewer homes have those these\ndays. What house actually looks like that? Almost none. So why do kids\ndraw them?”"

What they’ve seen\nothers make. An icon. A symbol.”\nMarasi narrowed her eyes. “That’s an interesting observation,\nConstable … what was your name?”\n“I go by Moonlight,” the woman said. “We like code names. It’s one of\nour things.”\n“I … have never heard that word before.”\n“You wouldn’t have, since you have no moon here.” The woman leaned\nback and stretched out her arm on the top of the steering wheel, causing her\nsleeve to inch back and reveal a red tattoo on her forearm, above the wrist.\nThe same symbol that had been on the card left for her.\nSlowly, cautiously, Marasi reached for the pistol in the holster under her\narm.\n“You won’t need that,” the woman said, her eyes still on the road.\nThey’d been forced to slow considerably now that they were approaching\nthe center of the city. Who would have guessed that an Outer City would\nhave so much traffic?\n“Where’s the constable who should have been driving this truck?”\nMarasi asked. “What did you do to her?”\n“Nothing,” the woman said. “She’s fine. But I find it amusing that’s the\nfirst thing you ask. I mean, I understand—but maybe get your priorities\nstraight, Marasi.”\nMarasi kept her fingers lightly on the grip of the handgun, but didn’t\ndraw it. “Was it you in the cavern? The person wearing a white mask?”\n“It was black,” the woman said, passing that little test. “Yes. That was\nme.”\n“And … are you human?”\n“One hundred percent,” the woman said. “I’m not a local though.” She\npulled off her cap, revealing straight black hair in a ponytail and uncommon\nfeatures. A shape to the eyes Marasi had never seen, prominent cheekbones.\n“Are you from the Southern Continent?” Marasi asked.\n“No.” Moonlight nodded to the city outside. “I’ve always hated\nBilming. I should like the thought they put into design, yet the underlying\nmessage disturbs me. They’re trying hard to make each building individual,\nbut the way it comes together is too deliberate. It makes the artistry feel\nhollow.”\n“And why do you think that is?”\n“Because of Trell’s influence, obviously.”\nMarasi leaned forward. “Tell me. Please.”\nMoonlight glanced at her for the first time. Such self-assured eyes, with\na cocked half smile on her lips. This was a woman who had put herself at\nthe very center of a group of constables and didn’t seem the slightest bit\nworried.\n“So hungry,” Moonlight said. “We don’t always share answers with\noutsiders, Marasi.”\n“I could have you arrested and interrogated.”\n“On what charges?”\n“Interfering with constable business.”\n“Interfering? How? I was instructed to drive this truck.”\n“Don’t play coy,” Marasi said. “You’re impersonating a constable—plus"

Rust and Ruin …\nMarasi had known that there were other planets out there, of course. The\nkandra talked about it. But … rusts. It was still hard to accept.\nThey pulled to a halt as some traffic worked its way into the street ahead\nof them. As they did, a beggar came to Marasi’s window. Per the notebook’s\ninstructions, Marasi unlatched the window and folded it down, then handed\nthe beggar a few boxings. The dirty man slipped her a piece of paper.\n“Can you get to Biggle Way?” Marasi asked, reading the note.\n“Yeah,” Moonlight said, turning them down the next street. “That’s in\nthe industrial district.”\nMarasi’s truck pulled into the lead and the convoy followed her, all ten\nkeeping in a tight double line. At the next corner, Wayne’s truck came up\nbeside them. She could make him out talking the ear off his driver—who\nturned out to be Hoid, Wax’s coachman. How had he gotten involved in the\nsting?\n“Can’t tell these days,” Moonlight said, “if I’m keeping watch on him,\nor if he’s keeping watch on me. Realistically, we’re both just keeping watch\non the same third parties…”\n“What. Hoid?” Marasi asked. “He’s been in Wax’s employ for years.\nHe’s an odd fellow, but…”\nIn the next truck, Hoid glanced at them—past Marasi—and nodded to\nMoonlight.\nDamn. What in the world? How much of her time had she wasted on\nbank robberies or protection rackets, when this was going on?\nWhatever this was.\n“Has it ever struck you,” Moonlight said, “how art is so destructive?”\n“Art?” Marasi said, frowning. “Destructive?”\n“Each new movement consumes the one that came before,” Moonlight\nsaid, starting them forward as the traffic began to creep into motion again.\n“Chops it up and feeds on the corpse. Takes the bones, but drapes new skin\non them. Each new piece of art is in some way a parody of what has come\nbefore.”\n“You sound like an artist yourself.”\n“I have certain talents,” she said. “My experiences have given me an\ninterest in the quirks of the artistic world—and its … values, you might say.\nTell me. Let’s say you had one of only sixteen extremely rare pieces of art\nby the same artist. What would you do to ensure yours becomes the most\nvaluable?”\n“If I play along,” Marasi said, “will you tell me about Trell?”\n“I’m trying to, right now.”\nMarasi frowned, considering. “I have one of sixteen pieces of art … and\nI must ensure mine is the most valuable?”\n“Yup.”\n“I’d try to create an air of mystique around it,” Marasi said. “I wouldn’t\nshow it off.

These pieces of art exist, Marasi, and\nyour planet’s god holds two of them.”\n“Ruin and Preservation.”\n“Indeed. That makes Harmony the most valuable—the most Invested—\nbeing in the cosmere. One of the other sixteen decided the best way to\nimprove his stock was to try to destroy all the others. He managed it in a\nfew cases.”\n“And … is that Trell?”\nMoonlight shook her head. “No, his name is Odium. Trell—Autonomy\n—had a different idea. You see these buildings? These houses? All pieces of\na larger art installation. The grand creation is impressive, but it’s not yours.\nThis kind of pattern, and those straight lines, those reflective panels …\nthat’s from a Taldain movement known as brutalism.\n“That’s part of what I hate about Autonomy. She claims she wants\neveryone to be individual. Gives them each a little house that is distinctive\nfrom the others, but only in a way that fits her plan, her desires. It’s fake\nindividualism. A corporate uniqueness. Like an advertisement telling people\nto go their own way, be their own person—by buying this product like\neveryone else.”\nMarasi struggled to parse all of this. But what she understood reinforced\nwhat she had suspected. A being from another planet was leading this city,\nand had plans for the people of Marasi’s world.\n“What is Trell’s goal, then?” Marasi asked. “If he doesn’t want to\ndestroy the other gods?”\n“Trell is trying to edge out the others,” Moonlight said. “She—he, they,\nit varies—doesn’t like engaging other gods directly. We call them Shards,\nby the way. Autonomy is trying to outcompete the others by filling the\ncosmere with versions of herself. Crowd out the competition, so to speak.\nLike an extremely invasive plant moving into another ecosystem and\nstrangling the local varieties.”\nMarasi frowned. “I … think I understand.”\n“Conversations about Autonomy can be confusing,” Moonlight said, her\neyes on the road. “Trellism is the remnants of an ancient religion on your\nworld, originally founded by Autonomy long, long ago. A seed for when she\ndecided to move in. Now, that time has come. Autonomy is looking for\nsomeone on this planet to fully take up that role, that identity.”\n“Wait, take up that role?”\n“She wants to leave a god behind on this planet,” Moonlight explained.\n“Someone who bears some of her power, who sees to her interests, and is—\nin many ways—a piece of her soul.

        "text": "in many ways—a piece of her soul. She does this all around the cosmere.\nSome worlds have entire pantheons that are all versions of her, each of\nwhich has a distinct personality and identity.”\n“So … she’s role-playing? With herself?”\n“Yes,” Moonlight said. “But Autonomy’s Investiture has a life of its\nown, and so each version of her becomes its own thing over time.\nSometimes they aren’t a person but only power. Other times, if the situation\nneeds more oversight, she picks someone to elevate.”\n“So…” Marasi said, “she’s going to take our world by setting up a rival\ngod and forcing Harmony out?”\n“Basically,” Moonlight said. “Your planet is a primary target for her,\nMarasi. Two Shards in residence, held by one person, frightens her. You had\ngunpowder weapons and electricity before any planet in the cosmere aside\nfrom her core homeworld. She sees you getting stronger, learning more and\nmore. Getting close to real secrets. It makes you the biggest threat in the\ncosmere, at least to her.”\n“I don’t see how this could defeat Harmony though.”\n“I don’t either, honestly,” Moonlight said. “I’m not sure any human can\nunderstand the full plan. But she knows Harmony has trouble acting, and so\nshe has seen an opportunity.”\nMarasi sat back, breathing out, her hand slipping from her gun.\nAnswers. Actual answers. She’d been searching for so long, hit so many\ndead ends. To finally get an explanation felt … wonderful.\n“So Autonomy is looking for an avatar,” Marasi said.\n“She’s likely found one. A woman named Telsin.”\n“Wax’s sister?” Damn.\n“Granted, there’s rivalry among the ranks,” Moonlight said. “There\nalways is, with Autonomy. So Telsin will have to prove she’s the strongest,\nthe best. And, since creativity and individualism are Autonomy’s stated\nintents, she’ll reward grit, success, vision.”\nMoonlight nodded to the half-finished buildings they were passing.\n“This city is an example of that, all designed by one gifted architect Telsin\npromoted five years ago. His work is meant to impress Autonomy … but\nthe individual homeowners? They don’t get to design anything. They get a\nmanufactured ‘individual’ house.”\n“Seems like a raw deal,” Marasi said.\n“Depends on what you want,” Moonlight said. “Living under her can be\nsafe if you keep your head down, don’t stray into the dangerous regions\nwhere she demands that you test yourself. Autonomy is brutal, but also\ngenerous. If you impress her, you rise through her ranks. Even if you go\nagainst what you’re told, and you are successful, you are rewarded.”\n“And if you fail?”\n“It doesn’t go well for you,” Moonlight said. Her eyes grew distant.\n“She sickens me. But I do understand her … I think. It’s taken a while.”\nMarasi sat back in her seat, thoughtful. Answers, finally. But at the same\ntime … how much could she trust this woman? Was any of this true?\n“Why explain this to me now?” Marasi asked.\n“Because you’ve impressed my organization,” Moonlight said. “We who\ndefend Scadrial have to move very carefully; there are forces in this world"

        "text": "“Why explain this to me now?” Marasi asked.\n“Because you’ve impressed my organization,” Moonlight said. “We who\ndefend Scadrial have to move very carefully; there are forces in this world\n—Harmony included—that might crush us, if we take the wrong step.”\nThat gave Marasi pause. If they didn’t work for Harmony, who did they\nwork for?\nMoonlight led the truck caravan off the highway at last, passing through\nthe outskirts of the city on the northern edge.\n“It’s so … fabricated,” Moonlight said. “Look at that sign. You see it?”\n“The billboard?” Marasi said, glancing at the large posted drawing of a\nstylized version of Bilming, with light rising behind it. PRIDE IN PROGRESS, it\nsaid. OUTER CITIES SELF-RELIANCE MOVEMENT.\n“Those are all over the city,” Moonlight said. “Nights! The same exact\npiece of art, a hundred times over. Art that can be reproduced … is it really\nart at all?”\n“Of course it is,” Marasi said. “Why would it stop being art just because\nit’s replicated?”\n“It’s crass.”\n“Said like an elitist,” Marasi said. “If you truly were interested in the\nbeauty of the art—instead of some tangential sense of control—you’d want\neveryone to be able to experience it. The more the better.”\n“Well argued,” Moonlight said. “I’ll admit that my distaste for\nAutonomy might taint my opinion.”\nThey led the convoy onto Biggle Way, then drove slowly in a single-file\nline. Eventually someone fell into step alongside Marasi’s truck, wearing a\nred jacket as the notebook said. She unlatched the window again.\n“Ahead, across the Grand Motorway,” he said. “Third building on the\nright.”\nShe nodded and put the window back up. At the end of the street, they\nreached the Grand Motorway—a vast six-lane highway. Marasi had never\nseen a street so wide. “Are there really so many cars these days that such a\nthing is necessary?”\n“They’re planning,” Moonlight said, “for a much larger city in the\nfuture.”\nWell, they might not need that many lanes yet, but there was still plenty\nof traffic on the Grand Motorway. They had to wait for traffic to slow and\ngive them a chance to cross. Ahead she could see a line of large warehouses\n—the third one’s cargo door was open. That was it, their drop-off.\n“Are you going to interfere?” Marasi asked. “With our operation?”\n“No,” Moonlight said. “You have my word.”\n“Can I talk to you afterward?” Marasi asked.\n“Yes,” Moonlight said. “But Marasi, I can only say so much to an\noutsider. For now I’m just here to watch.”\nAt a lull in the traffic, Moonlight pulled across—though the other nine\ntrucks had to wait their turn.\n“And what if bullets start flying?” Marasi asked. “You’re going to sit\nhere and watch?”\n“I’m not a constable, as you pointed out,” Moonlight said. “So yes.\nConsider me an external admirer of your work. Interested in the quirks of\nthose who follow the law—and their … value.”\nShe smiled in a knowing way, then pulled into the cavernous warehouse."

Interested in the quirks of\nthose who follow the law—and their … value.”\nShe smiled in a knowing way, then pulled into the cavernous warehouse.\nAs soon as all ten trucks arrived, the sting could begin.\n21\nWayne nodded as the trucks ahead waited to cross the highway. “Well then,\nHoid,” he said to the coachman, “that’s all I know about how to pickle\nvegetables.”\n“… Thank you?” Hoid said.\n“’S all right,” Wayne said. “I’m a bastion of useful information, I am.”\nThe truck ahead of them pulled forward, crossing the vast motorway\nfilled with sixteens upon sixteens of cars. Hoid moved their truck up, next\nin line.\n“Can I have my harmonica back now?” Hoid asked.\nWayne fished in his pocket and brought it out. “I traded you fair for\nthis!”\n“You did nothing of the sort.”\n“I did!” Wayne said. “The trade is in the glove box. You’re always too\nwatchy for me to slip things in your pocket. How’d you get so good at that,\nanyways? You’re a rusting coachman.”\n“Practice,” Hoid said solemnly. “A very great amount of practice.” He\nopened the glove box, and a bright white creature with a long, hairless tail\npeeked out. “Wayne. A live rat?”\n“I call him Sir Squeekins,” Wayne said. “I wasn’t gonna bring him, but\nhe snuck into my pocket, he did. So I figure, ‘That’s the seventeenth time\nyou’ve let him escape his cage, Wayne. Better give him to someone\nresponsible.’”\n“You are a uniquely bizarre individual,” Hoid said, smiling as the rat\ncrawled up his arm. “But … trade accepted, I guess?”\n“Great, great,” Wayne replied. “He likes strawberries and booze, but\ndon’t give him none of the booze, ’cuz he’s a rat.”\n“Noted.”\nThey waited at the edge of the wide roadway. And Wayne, he’d had this\nfeeling all day today. Something was happening. Something important.\n“You ever feel,” Wayne said, “like you wish life was like the stories?”\n“What do you mean?” Hoid asked.\n“There’s always a good ending in those stories. The ones my ma used to\ntell … they meant something. People, they were worth something.”\n“I think we live stories every day,” Hoid replied. “Ones that we will\nremember, and tell, and shape like clay to be what we need them to be.”\n“The last story my ma told me,” Wayne said, “was about a lawman.\nFunny, huh? That I’d end up becoming one. Except he was a hero. And\nI’m … well, I’m me.”\n“You do yourself a disservice, Master Wayne,” Hoid said softly.\n“Can’t be no hero if you were a villain, Hoid.”\n“But in most of the stories, it is the villain who knows the hero best.”\nWayne chewed on that, watching the flow of cars on the road ahead.\nAnd … found himself imagining that roadway as a river. Because a part of\nhim wished that what Hoid said could be true.\nThen he waited some more.\nAnd some more."

Someone really ought to come up with a way to make it so cars\nthat wanted to cross had a better chance. Maybe you could hire someone to\nstand at the corner and fire a gun in the air when too many cars were\nblocking the way, and frighten them to move faster? Anyway, that zooming\nof cars … that road could be a wide river. Yeah, a river of stone and steel.\nFaster than any other river in the world.\nHe smiled, remembering a calm, beautiful voice that had kept his world\nsolid for so long.\nYeah, there’s a bandit to be chased, he thought. But it’s still wrong.\nWhere’s the hero? He should be here, but he stayed behind.\nIn a lull, Hoid gunned the truck and they scooted across—earning only\nthree honks from cars that had to slow. Pretty good, considering. You could\ncross even the fastest river, full of the worst kinds of rocks, if you were in a\nbigger rock yourself. No need to fly, like Jak had in the story. This wasn’t\ncheating. It was just a smarter way, it was.\nFollowed by the last of their convoy, they pulled into the dim warehouse\nlit by some unlatched windows up along the tops of the walls. Why put the\nwindows up there, where nobody could see outta them?\nOh, right. Illegal stuff. Yeah, that made sense.\n“Thanks for the ride, Hoid,” Wayne said, pulling out his gangster hat—a\nworn wool cap traded off one of the thugs they’d caught. “You might wanna\nkeep your head down if this next part gets shooty. Hope it won’t though.”\n“Understood, Master Wayne,” Hoid said. “Best of luck.”\nWayne nodded, and it was time to become someone else. He scrunched\nup his face, squinting like Franis did—that was the guy he’d gotten the hat\noff of. A fellow Wayne’s height and age, but more weathered. By time, by\nsmokes, by the things he’d done. Wayne already wore a wig to change his\nhair color, along with a bit of rubber on his chin to square it out, and some\nmakeup to sink his eyes. With the hat, he was Franis—missing only one\nthing.\nHe climbed out and swaggered. Franis sure knew how to swagger.\nVenDell—wearing the Cycle’s body, a man named Granks—met him\noutside the truck. The others waited quietly. All those dirty conners in the\ntrucks would jump out only when they had someone important to catch.\nSomeone more than a bunch of useless, low-level cretins.\nNot that Franis was a cretin. He just needed work, you know? You\nstarted by taking a job at the docks, but work there grew tight. And the\nschedules were so bad. Then you heard your friend Vin had a job with\nsomeone who paid better, and all you had to do was move some boxes.\nWho could get into trouble for moving boxes? Even if you did have to keep\na gun on you at all times, and be ready to shoot."

Even if you did have to keep\na gun on you at all times, and be ready to shoot.\nHe swaggered in beside VenDell in his fancy suit and fancier body. “It’s\nuncanny,” the kandra said, “how you do that. You imitate a person nearly as\nwell as one of my kin.”\n“Just gotta find someone what looks a little like you,” Wayne said, “and\nmake up the difference. Also, stay in character.”\n“Right, right,” the kandra said. He wasn’t half bad—considering what a\nfussy little thing he normally was. He wore Granks’s body well. A gangster\nwho had proven himself enough to be elevated. Given a title and some\nauthority, while the rest of them were basically hired hands.\nThey crossed the vast chamber toward two fellows who emerged from\nthe perimeter. Indeed, a lot of fellows began moving in. A good forty armed\nmen. A local gang. That was … more people than the constables had.\nWe’ll have surprise though, Wayne thought. And the trucks were\narmored, offering cover. It should be fine, with Wayne and Marasi—not to\nmention a Faceless Immortal—on their side. MeLaan was quite the fighter;\nVenDell should be handy in a scrap too.\nThe two fellows that stepped up to meet with them wore work clothing:\nsuspenders, trousers, buttoned shirts. Not good enough. They needed at\nleast a Suit—the rank that Granks would report to—and preferably a\nSequence, or even a fully promoted Series. There were only a couple of\nthose in the Set at a time though. And one leader. The Key.\nWayne/Franis didn’t want any of those important jobs. He wasn’t\ninterested in wearing the fancy clothing and drawing the gunfire. Pay him\nhis wages and let him pretend he wasn’t doing nothing wrong.\n“Cycle,” said the stouter of the two men, nodding. He would probably\nbe a fellow named Dip, according to the interrogations. Or … maybe he\nwas one named Embrier.\nWhoever he was, he glanced at Franis, but didn’t say anything to him\ndirectly. “You can leave the trucks,” he told VenDell. “Gather your men in\nthe two vans outside and head home. Your success has been noted.”\n“Fine,” VenDell grumbled—using a pretty good version of Granks’s\naccent. “But I need to talk to the Sequence. There’s an issue.”\n“The radio line isn’t good enough?” maybe-Dip said, glancing at his\ncompanion.\n“I have reason to believe the radios are compromised,” VenDell said.\n“The Sequence is here, isn’t he?”\nThat was Wayne’s suggestion. The leader types, they always hung\naround and watched. Didn’t trust good, honest(ish) thieves like Franis to do\ntheir job right. So yeah, a higher-level member of the Set would be here.\nSomewhere. Sure as Franis wasn’t Franis right now, but was somebody\nkind of close—as close as someone could get, unless he could wear Franis’s\nbones, which was cheatin’ and that was that.\nAnyway. Important negotiations. Life or death. Surrounded by forty\narmed men. Better pay attention."

Better pay attention.\n“I will convey your message to the Sequence,” maybe-Dip said.\n“That won’t be good enough,” VenDell said. “There is a problem. A\nvery large problem.”\nThe two thugs looked at one another. Damn … they were suspicious.\nWayne glanced at the people at the perimeter, who would need only one\noffhand comment to start shooting. So he made a quick decision. The fellow\nwouldn’t be the one named Dip. Because who would put a guy named Dip\nin charge of anything?\n“Hey, Embrier,” he said, using a slightly modified version of his own\naccent—dockworker, but overlaid with the kind of sniveling accent these\nthugs had all adopted. People what worked together, they started to pick up\none another’s ways of speaking. “Can we talk a spell?”\nThe stout man glanced at him, then nodded. “Yeah, Franis?”\nWayne waved him over, and they slipped to the side. VenDell started up\na conversation with the other man, going over the inventory they’d been\nable to “acquire.”\n“What’s up, Franis?” the thug said quietly, then thumbed over his\nshoulder. “The Cycle never cares about things like this. Just does what he’s\ntold.”\n“Brain like wet concrete,” Wayne agreed softly. “Can you believe he’s\nthe one what got chosen?”\n“I can believe it,” Embrier said. “He never questions. Unlike you.”\n“Hey,” Wayne said, “I only question when my paycheck is coming.”\n“Don’t we all,” Embrier said, then shot him a sideways glance. “You’ve\nbeen getting some sun.”\nDamn. The makeup hadn’t been light enough. Could he get the man to\nask after his father? Wayne had some good info from the real Franis on his\nfather. “You know. Heavy work. Like Dad always said—best work is the\nkind you do with your arms and back.”\n“Yeah, but don’t you live in a cavern?”\n“I don’t live in the rusting cavern,” Wayne said. “What, you think I stay\ndown there in the dark?”\nEmbrier grunted. “How’s your sister?”\nSister? Aw, rusts. Wayne glanced at Embrier. That smile.\n“You stay away from my damn sister,” Wayne said.\n“Just askin’,” Embrier said, raising his hands. “Ruin. No need to come\nout swinging.”\n“Look,” Wayne said softly, “Cycle isn’t acting strange—he’s worried.\nSaw some lady conner sniffing around our base. Dark hair. You know the\none?”\nThe man cursed under his breath. “Why didn’t you say so?”\n“I just rusting did. But Cycle wants to report it. Thinks he’ll get … you-\nknow-who’s attention. For spotting a conner what we know is likely to be\naround. Rusting idiot.”\nBut Embrier had gone a little pale at the implication that the Cycle\nwanted to draw Trell’s attention. Best to … ease away from that. Wayne\nthrew his arm around the fellow’s shoulder and walked them back toward\nthe others."

I’ve met this\nwoman, she’d be great for you.”\n“Really?” Embrier asked.\n“Sure. She thought Yulip was handsome.”\n“Yulip? The koloss-blooded who looks like a frog?”\n“Same one,” Wayne said, rejoining the others.\nEmbrier shook his head. “Insanity.” He nodded to VenDell. “I’ll go get\nthe Sequence. You can start your men unloading.”\nVenDell turned, waving for the process to begin. Hopefully Marasi\nwould keep her head down, like Wayne had told her. She was too damn\nobvious, that one. Needed to learn how to scrunch her face up and become\nsomeone she wasn’t, once in a while. Really helped with the self-loathing.\nStill shouldn’t have crossed the river without the hero, Wayne thought as\nthe two thugs jogged to the rear of the room and opened a door.\n“Seriously,” VenDell asked Wayne, “how do you do that? You don’t\neven have their bones.”\n“Gotta have fewer sticks up your posterior, VenDell,” Wayne said.\n“Yank one or two out, and you’ll see.”\n“It’s patently unfair,” he said. “A mortal should not be able to stand\nbeside one of the Bearers of the Contract and seem a fair match to their skill\nin imitation.”\n“Aw, jealousy,” Wayne said. He breathed it in. “Smells like cherry\nblossoms. Also, stop breakin’ character, ya sod.”\nFinally, two figures in nicer clothing stepped from a darkened room at\nthe back of the warehouse. Perfect. That was what they’d wanted.\nHopefully the waiting constables could—\nSuddenly, the outer doors slammed open and figures in brown began\nflooding in, pointing guns at the thugs. “Drop your weapons!” a voice\nshouted. “This is a sting!”\n“It’s the heat!” Wayne said, slipping his gun out of his holster.\nVenDell grabbed his arm.\n“Oh yeah,” Wayne said, letting his arm be lowered. “Right, right. I\nforget sometimes…”\nBut these weren’t their people. What the hell? All around, the thugs\nwere turning—but nobody fired, because more and more figures in brown\nwere pouring in. At least a hundred constables. Wearing …\n… the shield and tortoise, symbol of Bilming. These were local\nconstables.\nMarasi’s sting had just been stung.\n22\nMarasi groaned and sat up in her seat, pulling off the hat she’d used to\nobscure her face.\nBilming city constables. Wonderful. She glanced at Moonlight, who\nshrugged.\n“I had no idea,” Moonlight said.\nMarasi sighed. At least the locals knew to surround the Sequence and his\nflunky—a pack of at least twenty constables were holding weapons on him.\nThey might not know about the Set, but they understood things like\nsmuggling and gangsters. The rest of the newly arrived constables were\nrounding up thugs who had wisely decided not to shoot, as they were far\noutnumbered. They reluctantly dropped their weapons."

They reluctantly dropped their weapons.\nMarasi kicked open her door and hopped down. Immediately, several of\nthe advancing constables turned weapons on her. She sighed and raised her\nhands. “I’m Elendel Constabulary!” she shouted at them. “Special Detective\nMarasi Colms!”\n“What’s this?” a voice demanded. A tall woman with short blonde hair\n—wearing a Bilming uniform—pushed through the constables. Marasi\nthought she knew the woman.\n“Captain Blantach?” Marasi said. “We met at the intercity training event\nlast year.”\nThe woman looked Marasi up and down, then groaned. Nearby, some of\nMarasi’s people were hesitantly climbing out of the backs of trucks—\nshowing their credentials.\nCaptain Blantach put her palm to her forehead. “You’re kidding me,”\nshe said. “You’re running a sting inside my city?”\n“I have jurisdiction in the entire Basin,” Marasi said, fishing for the\npaperwork. “Constable-General Reddi authorized it under the oversight of\nthe governor.”\n“You claim jurisdiction in the entire Basin!” Blantach said, waving the\nauthorizations away. “Rusting Elenders. Of course you would pull an\noperation in my city and not even send word.”\nMarasi felt a little bad for the woman. Still, the Set had the Outer Cities\nunder its thumb. Sending advance word to the local constables would have\nbeen far too risky; there were almost certainly Set agents within Blantach’s\norganization.\nThough … the fact that the constables were here seemed to disprove that\ntheory.\n“You’re going to need to turn them over to us,” Marasi said, waving at\nthe gangsters.\n“Like hell we are,” Blantach said, folding her arms across her uniform\njacket, stiff and buttoned tight.\n“This is part of a much bigger network,” Marasi said.\n“Then we’ll discover that during interrogation.”\nMarasi sighed, but took a deep breath. “Blantach,” she said, “do we\nhave to fight this fight?”\nThe taller woman eyed her, but said nothing.\n“The politicians don’t get along,” Marasi said, “but that’s their business.\nOur business is protecting the cities—all of them. Just a couple of conners\nwith our hands full. Let’s work together rather than squabble.”\n“Perhaps I can agree to that … if we do it on my terms.”\n“This thing I’m hunting,” Marasi said, “it goes deep. Dangerously deep.\nAnd it has little tendrils of mist wrapping around all parts of society. Your\ncity’s leaders are almost certainly compromised.”\n“You said this wasn’t about politics.”\n“I said we shouldn’t worry about how divisive the politicians are being,”\nMarasi said. “But everything touches on politics these days. The group I’m\npursuing are deliberately stoking war between Elendel and the Outer Cities.\n“If we get close to them, there are elements in both governments who\nare going to try to stop us. Which is why I couldn’t warn you we were\ncoming. I apologize for that, but most in my own government don’t know\nabout this operation.”"

I apologize for that, but most in my own government don’t know\nabout this operation.”\nBlantach waved away an aide who came trotting up, perhaps to deliver a\ncount of enemies taken captive, and continued to regard Marasi. This\nsituation was a bit like a political negotiation—but Marasi had an advantage\nover Steris and Wax. You never really could tell what senators wanted. But\nfellow constables?\nYou didn’t take up this job for glory—or at least you didn’t stay in this\njob for glory. Anyone who wanted glory quickly moved on to judgeships or\nattorney positions, promoted away from actual detective work as soon as\npossible. But Blantach was a career constable. She’d been in her job longer\nthan Reddi.\n“You’re making me worried, Colms,” Blantach said.\n“How hard was this operation to organize?” Marasi asked. “Were those\nin your own government—higher members of the constabulary—working\nagainst you?”\n“That’s how everything is.” Blantach shrugged. “You know red tape.\nIt…” She trailed off, frowning. “There might have been a tad more on this\nmission.”\n“So why didn’t they quash it entirely?” Marasi whispered. “Why’d they\nlet you continue?”\n“I was determined.”\nThat wasn’t it. If the Set had known about this mission, and had been\nintent on quashing it, they would have.\nThe weapons were being smuggled here to arm the forces in Bilming\nanyway, Marasi realized. So it’s fine if the government seizes them. They’ll\nstill go where they need to. The Set had to run a delicate operation. They\nmight be in control of Bilming, but most people didn’t know that. So why\ntip their hand and prevent a raid, when all the Set needed to do was make\nsure the seized goods went to the right places in the city?\nAnd what of the Sequence? Marasi glanced at the pile of constables\nsurrounding him. He’d been bound, but maintained an air of confidence. He\nhad a refined look, a stylish suit. Thick eyebrows and prominent lips. Her\nguess was that he had been aware of the sting and was playing along,\nknowing he’d be released later.\nThen he saw Marasi. And he cocked his head, frowning. He stepped\ncloser and had to be restrained by the constables—as if he’d forgotten about\nthem. He stared at her, confused.\nA moment later he smiled a broad, even excited smile. He flexed, then\nstretched his neck.\nRusts. What was she missing?\nOh hell. What better way to spark further controversy in the Basin than\nto suddenly find a bunch of Elendel constables interfering in local business?\nParticularly if …\n“Blantach,” Marasi said, grabbing her arm, “we have to sedate that\nman.”\n“What? Sedate him? Why?”\n“Aren’t you ready for Metalborn?” Marasi said.\n“There aren’t any Metalborn in this group,” Blantach said. “I have it on\ngood authority from—”\nThe Sequence chose that moment to let out an Allomantic Push of\nincredible strength.\n23"

The Bilming constables weren’t so\nwell prepared. They were tossed back by their own guns, handcuffs, and\nother accoutrements of their profession.\nBlantach screamed as she was knocked off her feet, but she was lucky to\nsuffer only a minor fall—many were tossed dozens of feet. Trucks rocked,\nand two even overturned. The doors at the sides of the building were blown\nfree. Windows cracked and people cried out as guns were shoved across the\nfloor and hit the walls—except for a few unaffected weapons that lay on the\nground. Apparently some of the enemy had been given aluminum guns.\nThe Sequence casually scooped one of these up, now standing at the\nepicenter of a blast of power unlike any Marasi had experienced from an\nordinary Coinshot. She stepped back, awed. That had been something\nlike … like from the old stories. Like Harmony had recorded in the\nhistories, detailing the power available to the Ascendant Warrior.\nIt was a horrible sign. Because Marasi realized why the Sequence was\nsmiling. While he’d likely been planning to go along with his arrest, now\nthat he’d found a chance to implicate Elendel in a scandal, he would want to\ncause as many casualties as possible.\nWhile the others were recovering, Marasi dove for one of the aluminum\nguns. But the Sequence took aim and fired directly in front of her, driving\nher—still unarmed—into cover behind an overturned truck. The Allomantic\nPush had stopped for now, fortunately.\nYou’ve read about this, she thought. It’s one of the ancient powers\navailable only to Mistborn.\nIt was called duralumin, an arcane metal. Using it, an Allomancer could\nburn their entire metal reserve at once. Like detonating a keg of gunpowder\ninstead of a single bullet, it released an enormous burst of Allomantic\nenergy. At least … that was what she remembered. It hadn’t been relevant in\ncenturies, because no one could have two Allomantic powers at once.\nUnless you had Hemalurgic spikes.\nA figure in a wool cap and wig scrambled up beside her a moment later.\nWayne was followed by VenDell in the broad-chested Cycle’s body. A\nsecond later Wayne’s speed bubble gave the three of them some breathing\nroom.\n“They were ready for us!” Wayne said. “They knew we was going to\npull this sting!”\n“No,” Marasi said. “They knew about Blantach and her constables, but I\nthink they didn’t mind being captured. My guess is they were going to go\nalong with that sting, and slip out of jail later.”\n“So what changed?” he asked.\n“The Sequence just realized we’re here from Elendel,” Marasi said,\n“and decided to use our presence to create an incident—constables dead—\nand blame it on Elendel interference in a Bilming operation.”\nIt was still merely a guess. The facts were clear though. The moment he"

The facts were clear though. The moment he\nsaw Marasi, a man who had been about to go quietly had decided to fight.\nWhich put everyone in danger.\nShe glanced out from behind the truck, now that she didn’t have to\nworry about getting shot. The Sequence was casually pointing his gun\ntoward Captain Blantach, who was climbing to her feet. At the perimeter of\nthe room, constables and gangsters alike were picking themselves up off the\nground, disoriented. Those who had recovered first were frozen in the act of\nscrambling for weapons.\n“What’s the plan?” Wayne asked.\n“You distract that Sequence,” Marasi said to him. “I’ll organize our\nconstables. The Set’s forces seem surprised by that too—look at the shock\non their faces. I really think they planned to be captured, then released by\ncorrupt judges or prosecutors. We still have a chance to turn this around, if\nwe can take advantage of their disorientation.”\n“This is not the plan!” VenDell said, peeking past her.\n“Plans last until someone starts shootin’, mate,” Wayne said.\n“So unruly,” VenDell muttered. “All these beautiful bones are going to\nget crushed.”\n“Not if we can stop it,” Marasi said. “Help Wayne with that Sequence\nand take down any armed enemies you see. Be careful of our drivers—\nthey’re out of uniform but all wearing white shoes.”\n“Um…” VenDell said. “My. Hmm … When you say, ‘take down,’ what\nprecisely do you mean, Miss Colms?”\n“Kill?” Marasi said. “Shoot? Maim? Eat? I’m not picky, VenDell.”\n“Ah, yes, er,” he said. “You see, I am not much of a fighter. I’m a\nconnoisseur. A good planner. A bearer of deep and important thoughts.”\nShe glared at him.\n“I follow the First Contract, Miss Colms,” he said. “Like almost all\nkandra. I cannot kill, or even hurt, a living creature. Particularly not a\nhuman being.”\n“MeLaan never had that trouble,” Wayne said.\n“MeLaan is a miscreant!” VenDell said. “Why do you think she was\nassigned to you? Only she and TenSoon are capable fighters; the rest of us\nabhor it! I should, er, get away. And plan. Yes, plan how to respond.”\nMarasi glanced at Wayne, who was rolling his eyes.\n“You’re basically indestructible, right?” she said to VenDell. “Like\nMeLaan?”\n“Well, technically. But you see, I—”\n“Then get out there,” Marasi said, “and draw some fire. Also, if you can\nmanage it, toss me one of those aluminum guns.”\n“Very well,” he said with a deep sigh. “This is the last time I let\nHarmony convince me—”\nHe broke off as a short woman rounded the back of the truck, somehow\nmoving at their speed—and then she stepped into their speed bubble.\nThe stout woman wore a bowler hat and held a dueling cane in one"

Havin’ a meetin’? I\nlike meetin’ new folks. Killin’ them breaks the monotony.” She grinned,\nthen leaped for Marasi.\nIt was such an incongruous experience—no one had ever violated one of\nWayne’s bubbles—that Marasi reacted with embarrassing slowness. Wayne\nwasn’t so inhibited. He grabbed the woman by the arm as she swung,\npreventing the dueling cane from connecting with Marasi’s head.\nAll three of them fell in a jumble. Wayne ended up with the dueling\ncane, but the woman scrambled away. She became a blur for a second as\nshe hit the edge of the speed bubble—and then she was crossing the room at\nnormal human speed. A moment later she froze in place, moving sluggishly.\n“Damn!” Wayne said. “Another Slider!”\nOf course. Someone with Wayne’s same power—she could create her\nown speed bubbles. When she’d moved quickly for a moment, it was\nbecause her speed bubble had overlapped with Wayne’s, doubling her speed\nfor a split second. But she’d been forced to drop her bubble to keep moving\nthrough the room, as Sliders had to take brief breaks in using their powers.\n“Wayne,” Marasi said, “new plan. I’m going to try to grab my\nAllomantic grenades. They broke free during that blast earlier. You need to\nstop the strange version of yourself.”\n“What?” he demanded. “Because she’s a Slider, she’s a strange version\nof me?”\n“I agree,” VenDell said. “Wayne is already incredibly strange—so a\nstrange version of him would be normal.”\n“It doesn’t matter!” Marasi snapped. “Wayne, deal with the Slider.\nVenDell, distract the Coinshot. Ready?”\n“Ready,” Wayne said.\n“Not ready!” VenDell said.\n“Drop the bubble!” Marasi said, already leaping forward.\nWayne complied, and the sound of the room hit her in a cacophony. Men\nscrambling for weapons and starting to fire. Screams and shouts of pain.\nConstables trying to organize themselves—a dozen different voices giving\nconflicting orders.\nMarasi tackled Captain Blantach—who had barely reached her feet—\npushing her behind another of the trucks. The Sequence’s shots hit the floor,\ntossing up chips of concrete, barely missing the woman.\nBlantach scrambled to her feet in surprise, then nodded in thanks to\nMarasi, who already had her back to the truck. It was the one she’d ridden\ninto the building—but Moonlight was nowhere to be seen.\nWayne tackled the Slider a moment later. VenDell hopped out from\nbehind the fallen truck and began waving his hands. “Look at me!\nDefenseless! And a traitor! Ha! I’m going to tell the constables everything!”\nHe took a shot straight to the head.\n“Rusts!” Captain Blantach shouted, finally putting it all together. “They\nhave an Allomancer!”"

To me! We—”\nThe truck they were hiding behind lurched. Marasi barely leaped away\nin time as a second powerful Steelpush shook the room. The warehouse\nwalls rattled, wood breaking and nails ripping free. Men and women who\nhad found weapons were again shoved backward.\nAnd the truck Marasi had been using for cover was thrown away like it\nhad been drop-kicked. It crashed out onto the street, tumbling end over end,\nspilling boxes that shattered into weapons. Rusts!\nIt narrowly missed Blantach, who had already been on the move toward\nthe snarl of constables and thugs. Many of them had been knocked to the\nground.\nNow that Marasi’s cover was gone, she saw the Sequence shake an\naluminum flask, then unscrew it and take a drink. More metals, Marasi\nrealized. If she remembered correctly, every time the Sequence used\nduralumin he would need to restore his reserves.\nAs the Sequence finished drinking, a figure with a bullet hole in the\nforehead tackled him. VenDell was, at the very least, trying.\n“Organize the constables!” Marasi shouted to Blantach, then ran for the\ngaping open front of the warehouse. Somewhere in the debris was her\nmetals belt—with her grenades. Those had to be her best chance at stopping\na superpowered Allomancer.\nOn her way, she passed an incredible sight: Wayne and the other Slider\nfighting.\nWayne leaped toward the Slider in a sudden burst of speed—but\ndropped his bubble in midair. She tossed hers up, catching them both, and\nthe two became a blur of swinging dueling canes and frantic motion. The\nspeed bubble dropped and they split apart, rounding each other—before\nspeeding up and clashing again, so fast that Marasi couldn’t even make out\ntheir blurs.\nRusts. Stay focused, Marasi thought. She dodged out of the front of the\nwarehouse and scanned the debris—ignoring the sorry truck that lay upside\ndown nearby, one tire spinning.\nThere, she thought, leaping to grab her metals belt, which was peeking\nfrom beneath a broken box. She yanked it out and fished inside a pouch, but\nthe latch had broken open and two of the grenades had spilled free. She\nonly had one.\nA floppy body flew past and slammed into the overturned truck. It\nslumped and hit the ground, then rolled a mangled face toward her on a\nbroken neck. “I have been defeated,” VenDell said, words slurred by the\nbroken jaw. “I am billing you for these bones.”\n“Don’t be a baby,” she said, and immediately started burning cadmium.\nThe box buzzed in her fingers, charging up.\nShe dashed into the room to find that Blantach had gathered a group of"

Many of the gangsters were grouped at the rear of the\nchamber near the Sequence. They were arming themselves with weapons\nfrom the back rooms, it seemed, and others were pulling out riot shields.\nWayne and his foe were still blurs. The Sequence had risen into the air,\nhovering on a Steelpush. Bullets bent around him, striking the wall, unable\nto hit directly. Rusts. If he could do that, he was far more experienced with\nhis powers than the Cycle Marasi had fought. At least he couldn’t do those\nmega-Pushes without harming his own people.\nMarasi dashed in, low, and crouched up against one of the overturned\ntrucks. She set the timer on her grenade and watched for a moment when\nthe Sequence was turned. Hopefully he’d rely upon his powers to deflect\nbullets, and wouldn’t see her grenade.\nUnfortunately, the Sequence glanced in her direction as she hurled the\ngrenade. He barely managed to Push it away, and it detonated near the far\nwall, not catching anyone. He caught her eye from up there, then shot a coin\nher direction. She barely ducked under cover in time. Rusts. He could move\nthis truck at any moment.\nNo, she thought. He’d need an anchor as heavy. That was why the\nSequence had been doing those powerful, all-direction Pushes. He could\nPush with equal force in every direction and stabilize himself. He couldn’t\nmove a specific truck unless he could Push backward against something\nequally heavy.\nThat was little comfort when a count of her people showed many\nbleeding as they hid behind cover. Several were down, immobile. Plus, their\nenemy was regrouping … it gave her a bad feeling. What kind of gangsters\ntried to outgun the constables?\nThe kind who are heavily armed, Marasi thought. And think they can\nwin. We shouldn’t be fighting. Not this way.\nGunshots echoed in the room, and bullets banged on metal and stone.\n“We have to retreat,” she said. She signaled to Kellen, one of her\nlieutenants. “We need to set up covering fire and organize a retreat! We’re\nout through that opening.”\n“Retreat?” Kellen said, sliding closer. “But the enemy!”\n“We’re officers of the law,” Marasi said, “not soldiers. I’m not going to\nperpetuate a full-on battle in the middle of a city! Mission is a bust. Time to\nget out.”\nKellen thought for a moment, then nodded. “You’re right,” the woman\nsaid. “What do you want from me?”\n“Gather the others and help the wounded. I’ll coordinate with the\nBilming group, then set up a distraction. Which truck has the real\nexplosives?”\n“Number six!”\n“Wayne’s? Who decided that?”\n“Ruin, apparently,” Kellen said. “Hadn’t thought about it myself.”\nThey broke. Marasi slipped her handgun from the holster on her metals"

Marasi slipped her handgun from the holster on her metals\nbelt, then dodged across the open space to truck number six, where\nBlantach was taking shelter. Remarkably it hadn’t been toppled, though\nMarasi didn’t think trying to drive out would be wise. Not when the\nSequence had the power to overturn vehicles.\n“We’re going to retreat,” Marasi said to Blantach. “You with us?”\n“Rusts yes,” Blantach said. “I feel like I opened a picnic basket and\nfound a nest of hornets. Who are these people?”\n“They’re the ones trying to undermine our civilization,” Marasi said.\nShe slapped the truck. “We have explosives inside this one. I’m going to\ntoss some at the enemy to cover our retreat.”\n“Give me a minute,” Blantach said. “I’ll get my people ready to join\nyou. We have wounded.”\n“So do we,” Marasi said. “Hopefully the explosion will give us enough\ntime.”\nMarasi took a deep breath, then pulled open the door of the truck and\nscrambled inside. There she was able to open the panel between the cab and\nthe cargo area and slip into the back. It was dark in here, but she knew the\nbox with the explosives would be at the rear—ready to show off on\ndelivery.\nShe located a few conventional grenades by touch inside the box. And\nwhat she hoped was a firebomb, which would be clay and liquid, immune to\nPushes.\nWorries chased her as she squeezed back into the cab, then ducked low,\ncounting on the plating in the passenger door to protect her from gunfire.\nThe more she considered it, the worse she liked their position.\nIf we run, he’ll do another of those powerful all-out Pushes, she\nthought. We’ll be ducking out the doors while trucks roll over us.\nBut what else could she do? She slipped out of the truck with her\nexplosives. Kellen and Blantach nodded to her, ready for the retreat. The\nwarehouse was alive with gunfire, but on their side it was only a few\nconstables keeping the enemy distracted while the rest helped the wounded.\nTime for—\nThe Sequence dropped from the air, landing directly in the middle of the\nfour trucks they were using as cover. Then he Pushed—two trucks on each\nside—shoving the vehicles out of the way with an incredible Steelpush.\nIn an instant, their cover was gone. The collection of beleaguered\nconstables found themselves completely exposed, hauling the wounded to\ntheir feet. At the other end of the room, the gangsters had built a little\nfortification out of sandbags—and now one of them snapped a large multi-\nbarrel rotating machine gun onto a tripod. Military grade, liquid cooled and\nchain fed, with bullets longer than a person’s palm. Those had been\ndeveloped in case of a Malwish invasion, and were illegal to smuggle out of\nElendel.\nThe full extent of how outgunned they were struck Marasi right then.\nThe room fell strangely silent, though she thought she heard glass shatter\nsomewhere.

A part of her mind registered the sound, but she focused on that\nmachine gun. She stood at the head of the constables, staring directly at the\nbarrel. Realizing what was about to happen.\nShe’d brought barely armed police to a battlefield.\nThe machine gun started up with a ripping percussive sound, and spat a\nconcentrated stream of bullets straight at Marasi and the others.\nThen those bullets stopped in the air.\nThen immediately went soaring backward toward the enemy\nfortification, hitting sandbags and shields and making the gangsters cry out\nin surprise. The machine gun cut off, and the warehouse fell silent for a\nmoment. Unnerved, Marasi glanced over her shoulder—to find Waxillium\nLadrian standing just behind her, mistcoat tassels flaring as he turned and\naimed a pistol right over her shoulder. He fired with a single crack of\ngunpowder.\nThe shot drilled straight through the viewfinder on the machine gun and\nsent the man who had been firing it to the ground, a bullet through the eye.\n“Sorry I’m late,” Wax announced to the crowd. “Had to wait for gunfire\nto lead me to you. Shall we carry on, then?”\n24\nFighting someone in a fair way was completely unfair, Wayne decided. He\nconnected with his dueling cane—which made a nice resonant crack against\nthe cheater’s skull. She went down, but rolled and was back up in a second,\ngrinning as the wound on her head healed—a little trickle of blood running\ndown her now-pristine skin.\nOf course they’d given her the ability to heal. Marvelous. Just rusting\nmarvelous.\nShe became a blur, and he barely erected his own speed bubble in time\nto catch sight of her to the left. He crossed his canes to block her strike.\nThen he started swinging.\nHe pummeled her on one side as she did the same to him on the other\nside. Rusting Ruin and rusting hell! That smarted. And it made about as\nmuch sense as drinking the expensive whiskey once you were already\ndrunk. Both of them backed off, wincing—but tapping their metalminds to\nheal.\n“Harmony’s holy missing bits, woman,” he said, shaking his bruised\narm. “You’re annoying.”\n“You’re annoying,” she said. “You’re … yoer…”\n“Stop trying to get my accent!” Wayne snapped.\n“Can you say ‘my’ again?” she asked, tossing her dueling cane up in a\nlittle spin and catching it.\nRusting.\nCheating.\nWoman!\nWayne had gotten his powers the fair way. By being born with them\nthrough pure luck. She’d gone and stolen hers from other folks. That was\nabsolutely cheating. Everybody knew there was things you could take and\nthings you couldn’t. Wax’s unused pocket watch? Fair game. The watch\nLessie had given him? Off-limits.\nPeople’s souls?

Yes, she could heal\nif he hit her, but a person could only heal so many times before running out\nof stored health. He had to keep hitting and hope she ran out before he did.\nShe dodged away this time.\n“Oi!” Wayne said. “Stand still.”\n“Oi…” she replied. “Oiiii…”\n“Stop that!”\nShe danced back, smiling. “I’ve been waiting for this for years,” she\nsaid—her accent fading away. “Planning, preparing. I was built for you,\nWayne. Aren’t you honored? I was made to kill you!”\n“Ah! Do you hafta be weird too?”\n“Once I kill you, I will wear your hat and carry your scent. It’s all I’m\nlacking.”\nHe stopped in place as she grinned at him. So. Rusting. Weird. She then\nturned, and her face fell. “What’s he doing here?”\nWayne edged over to see what she had. And … rusts, finally. The hero\nhad arrived. Wax stood there like Ruin himself, tassels swirling around him,\nprotecting the constables and firing wantonly into the enemy ranks.\nThe cheater was as good as defeated, now that Wax was here. All was\nright in the world.\nCourse, Wax was busy at the moment, and would need help. So Wayne\nbull-rushed the cheater, rammed his elbow into her gut—and felt something\nsharp in her arm when he did. Her metalminds maybe? Or the spike? Well\nthen. Now that Wax was here, they could do a Two-Faced Special. Except\nwith only Wayne, because Wax needed to shoot some folks.\nWhen the cheater tried to throw Wayne off, he twisted and let her lurch\ninto position. Then he reached around from behind her, took his dueling\ncane in two hands, and pulled it up under her chin. With a grunt, she began\nbattering at him, but that only threw her off balance.\nIn a moment Wayne had her on the ground, one knee against her back,\ndueling cane pulled up and choking her. He’d been in this situation himself,\nand it was not fun—feeling your metalminds bleed dry as you were forced\nto heal from suffocation.\nShe struggled in a frenzy. The world around them slowed and sped up in\nspurts as she panic-activated her powers. But for all her skill with the canes,\nshe’d skipped basic wrestling techniques. Someone who knew what they\nwere doing could have thrown him.\nHe shook his head, disappointed. “You can’t skip wrestling holds,\nmate,” he told her. “If you want to brawl properly, you’ve got to know how\nto win on the ground.”\nShe responded with grunts, which was much better than before.

Wayne had been up against the wall before the\nhero arrived.\nA figure in fine clothing dropped beside them. “Getruda,” he said to the\nwoman, “I’m disappointed in you.” Then he pointed a gun at Wayne’s head.\nRight, then. Wayne let go and ducked away. He dodged into a roll—\nbecause who doesn’t like a nice finishing roll—and came out of it with a\nspeed bubble in place, sheltering him and Marasi, who had been seeing to\none of the wounded.\n“Hey,” he said, puffing. “Things are looking up, eh?”\n“We should still pull out,” Marasi said. “This isn’t what we’re trained\nfor.”\n“Shame to leave when we’re winning though,” Wayne said. He nodded\nbehind him. The Sequence was pointing toward the way out—mid-order—\nand the cheater was on her feet, running in that direction.\n“Are we?” Marasi said. She looked down at Mathingdaw—the wounded\nconstable—who had her eyes shut tight, grimacing from the pain of a bullet\nhole in her leg.\n“If Wax deals with that Coinshot we are,” Wayne said. The enemy ranks\nwere in chaos as their men tried to hide.\n“They have at least a few aluminum bullets,” Marasi said, pointing to\nthe side. Indeed some bullets—moving ever so slowly through the air—\nwere ignoring Wax’s Pushes.\n“Why so few though?” Wayne said. “Miles Hundredlives had tons of\naluminum equipment.”\n“This group planned to be caught today,” she said. “I’m convinced of it.\nThey were going to let Blantach’s constables take them, rather than raise\nsuspicion by stopping the investigation.”\n“That’s a leap in logic,” Wayne said. “But you’re often right about this\nsorta thing. They wouldn’t want much aluminum to be taken. Departments\nhave a habit of meltin’ it down for the money.”\nWayne glanced toward Wax, who stood out in front. Frozen as he\npointed with three fingers at a passing bullet. He seemed to be … guiding it\nto the side.\nNah. That was a bit much, even for Wax.\n“My gut says,” Wayne replied, “that if we hold out this lot will scatter.\nSee, they already got a newsworthy incident by fightin’ us, and there’s not\nmuch more to gain. But we have wounded, and it’d be tough to pull out.”\nMarasi nodded. “All right then. We hold position. So long as Wax\nchases off that Coinshot.”\n“Dropping the bubble.”\n“Go.”\nHe dropped it. Wax continued his spin, and rusts … the bullet he’d been\npointing at seemed to go straight for one of the gangsters trying to sneak up\non the constables’ position.\n“Wax!” Marasi shouted. “We can handle these. But I need that Coinshot\ndealt with!”\nWax glanced at her, then nodded and fired at the Coinshot, who dodged\ninto the air.

The smarter\ngangsters realized what was up and ducked out any way they could. Wayne\nleaped out in front to draw fire, and Marasi scrambled to the side of the\nroom. He wondered why until her grenade froze a small group of enemies.\nThe rest of this was cleanup; the real fight had moved to the sky. Wait,\nWayne thought. He put up a speed bubble so two nearby wounded could\ncrawl into the back of a truck for shelter. Did anyone warn Wax that the\nCoinshot can do those crazy super-Pushes?\nHmm. Well, Wayne supposed his friend would figure it out soon enough.\n25\nWax darted into the air and felt a sudden moment of disconnect. He’d flown\nthrough Elendel so often that he expected to see its sights. This city—with\nits round layout, elevated train, and huge warships in the port—was\ndisorienting. He had been here before, and knew about the strange design of\nthe buildings, no two the same. But from up here, he could see they were\narranged in an artistic pattern. Too orderly, too perfect, too balanced. Like a\nchild’s model of a city.\nThe enemy Coinshot bounded away toward the perimeter of the city,\nand Wax gave chase with a few Steelpushes. His opponent was talented,\nmaybe even a true Coinshot, augmented by Hemalurgy. He expertly Pushed\noff the buildings they passed, when newer Coinshots always looked for\nanchors—like cars—directly beneath them, and forgot about those behind.\nStill, Wax managed to gain on the man by anticipating where he would\nPush. Wax raised Vindication. He didn’t want to kill the Coinshot—they\nneeded answers—but perhaps a hit in the leg or arm would—\nThe man suddenly blasted into the air. The car below crumpled as if it\nhad been stomped flat, and Wax winced for the poor people inside. The\nCoinshot launched high into the sky, swift as a bullet, difficult to track\nagainst the blinding sun.\nWax landed in a scramble on a nearby rooftop. Rusting hell. That had\nbeen …\nDuralumin. Damn. It had only been a matter of time before he faced an\nenemy with this strength, but he’d merely read of those powers. Never\nfaced them. This threw out Wax’s every understanding of how to duel with\nanother Coinshot. How did you fight someone who could launch himself a\nmile into the air with a single Push?\nSame way you fight anyone, Wax thought. With skill and wit.\nIf Wax’s memory was right, the man would need to drink a new vial\neach time he used the power. Wax made his way to another rooftop, where\nhe’d stowed his pack before joining the fight. Here he grabbed an extra\npouch of aluminum bullets and dropped the Steel Survivor, as it was loaded\nwith conventional rounds. He raised Vindication, fully aluminum herself,\nand loaded with aluminum cartridges. The only other metals he had on him\nwere the vials Harmony had sent, inside his belt sheath, which was also\nlined with aluminum.\nHe’ll try to take me from above, Wax thought, scanning the sky.

The enemy had an aluminum weapon\ntoo, but Wax was able to leap over the side of the building to dodge. As he\nfell, he Pushed in through an upper window, landing in an apartment.\nThe room was empty. So if Wax could slide over to a window in another\nroom, he could maybe trap the enemy by—\nThe entire apartment wall caved in, torn to pieces by the metal girders\nbeneath the stonework. A wave of debris crashed into Wax and pushed him\nback against the far wall. He groaned, rubble tumbling around him, and\ncaught sight of motion through the newly ripped-open wall.\nThe Coinshot bounded up, holding an aluminum flask for restoring\nmetals, gun in his other hand. He’d caused a similar amount of destruction\nin the building across the street, which he’d used as an anchor for his\nterrible Push. A flask was clever; assuming he had it well saturated with his\nmetals, he could take a swig each time he used duralumin.\nWax ducked behind some rubble as the man fired, the stone popping\nwith sprays of white dust as bullets hit. Debris crunched underfoot and\nstreamed off Wax’s body as he took a few unaimed shots to drive the enemy\naway. It worked, but Ruin.\nWax shoved through the debris on shaky feet, stepping out into the\nhallway of the apartment building. He hid here for a moment, lightly\nburning steel to reveal sources of metal around him so he could judge the\nsize of the rooms in the surrounding apartments. He quietly reloaded—and\nslipped a metal vial from his belt to quickly restore his reserves.\nAs aluminum had dropped in price—from extravagant to merely\nexpensive—people had started to use it more and more. Like the sheath on\nWax’s belt. But that flask his enemy held, that was better. Wax’s vials would\nbe briefly vulnerable as he pulled them out to drink, whereas—\nA bullet drilled through the wood of the wall and nearly hit Wax in the\nhead. He dropped down, cursing, and waved away the confused bystanders\nwho had begun peeking out of their apartments. Another bullet followed,\nagain nearly hitting him. The Coinshot was firing them from outside, and\nPushing them through the wood. But how was he seeing Wax? He should be\ninvisible in here …\nIdiot, Wax thought, extinguishing his steel. The enemy must have a\nspike that let him use bronze to sense when someone was using Allomancy\nnearby. Wax ducked a little farther along the hallway, and no more bullets\ncame in through the wall. Perhaps the Coinshot would think him dead?\nAssuming he’s a natural Coinshot—which might be the case, given his\nskill—he’s got one spike for bronze and one for duralumin. At least. A\nhuman body could hold up to three spikes without exposing it to Harmony’s\ninfluence and direct control. But Marasi claimed the enemy had found a\nway to bypass that limit somehow. Perhaps it was Harmony’s blindness.\nPeople continued filling the hallway behind, despite Wax’s urgings.\nMany gathered around the broken apartment, gawking.

He reached the end of the hallway, opened the\nwindow with a solid kick, slipped out, and dropped—using his Feruchemy\nto decrease his weight so he wouldn’t hit too hard.\nImmediately, the enemy Coinshot appeared on a nearby roof and began\nshooting.\nWax scrambled around a corner and stopped filling his metalmind—\nwhich these days he wore embedded deep in his skin. A change he’d made,\nwith the help of surgeons, after the events surrounding the Bands of\nMourning. A person’s body acted like aluminum, protecting things like\nmetalminds from interference.\nThen again, the stories said that with enough power, an Allomancer\ncould ignore that. The Ascendant Warrior had done it. Rusts. At any rate,\nthe man had appeared soon after Wax tapped a metalmind. He’d seen Wax’s\nFeruchemy with his bronze, something only the very rarest of practitioners\ncould do. How skilled was this man?\nIf he’s watching for me to activate my abilities, Wax thought, let’s use\nthat.\nHe moved around the back of the building and found a drainage grate\nbeside the street. Wax gave it a single flared Push, popping him up in the\nair, but immediately cut off to soar upward by momentum. As most\nCoinshots would sustain long Pushes as they flew, this single short one\nmight make it appear that Wax was still on the ground.\nThe Push threw Wax up a good twenty feet, where he grabbed the side\nof the building just below the roof and clung to a stonework formation. He\nhung there, still hoping to take his opponent alive.\nFeet scraped the rooftop above, and a shadow shifted. With a deep\nbreath, Wax Pushed himself upward so he sprang up right in front of his\nenemy. A quick Push behind sent Wax slamming into the man, bringing\nthem both down in a heap on the rooftop.\nUsing the element of surprise, Wax—kneeling on top of his enemy—\npunched the man’s wrist to make him drop his pistol. Then he grabbed the\nfellow by the vest and raised his fist. By sticking close, he wouldn’t have to\nworry about potential speed bubbles—and Wax had no Pushable metal on\nhis person. It was possible the fellow had pewter for strength. A few\npunches across the face should be enough to determine that.\nWax pulled his enemy up and began laying into him. And damn, maybe\nhe was excited to be fighting again, but the blows didn’t seem to hurt Wax’s\nknuckles as much as they once had.\nThe enemy scrambled for his gun in a panic, but Wax kept punching.\nThere was a certain disorientation that struck the first time a fellow got\npunched, particularly in the head. It was a kind of disbelief, a stunned\nirreconcilability. Wax remembered his first time—the way his mind couldn’t\nbridge its past experiences with its new painful, fist-to-face existence. The\nman’s panic rose, and Wax realized his miscalculation a second later—as\nthe enemy unleashed an explosive Steelpush downward, against the nails\nand iron rods in the rooftop.\nWax and the Coinshot were flung upward in a roar of wind and a sudden"

Wax managed to hang on to the Coinshot for the first part\nof the ride. But before they reached the peak of their ascent, the man put his\nhand to Wax’s face, and Wax felt a sudden coldness.\nHis metal reserve vanished.\nThe Coinshot had another power. He was a Leecher, with the ability to\ndrain other people’s Allomancy. He smiled, meeting Wax’s eyes—and Wax\nscrambled to grab a vial from the pouch on his metals belt. The Coinshot\nthen grabbed Wax’s metals belt in one hand and kicked the two of them\napart. The belt, made to break away if someone Pushed on the metals\ninside, ripped free, and since Wax had his hand in it, the open latch meant\nthe vials were flung out into the air.\nBut Wax had managed to grab one vial. His steel gone, a hundred feet in\nthe air, he raised the vial to his lips—but only got the briefest taste of the\nliquid inside before the vial exploded. A shot from the enemy toward Wax’s\nface barely missed—but hit the vial, shattering it.\nWax immediately increased his weight, and the strange way that\naffected his momentum meant his upward speed slowed to a crawl. The\nnext shot passed through the air right over his head. A second after he\ncrested his rise and started falling, he switched to filling his metalmind to\ninstantly boost his downward speed—but made sure not to get so light that\nwind resistance would counteract that. More shots passed over his head as\nthe Coinshot had trouble predicting his motion. Wax fell in a tumble, and\ndespite the mayhem—despite the way his guts were in a knot and his mind\ndizzy from the sudden ejection—he realized one thing.\nWithout metals, he was dead. If he couldn’t change his trajectory, the\nnext bullets would strike him as the Coinshot adjusted his aim. Falling\nslowly wasn’t enough. He reached for metals inside of him, and managed to\nfind the faintest bit of steel from the sip. He used it to shove himself in the\nair, Pushing on the spire of a building, dodging the next shots from above.\nThen it was gone. Nothing but rushing wind. Then he looked up and saw\none of his vials tumbling downward, and he momentarily increased his\nweight once again to slow his fall and draw even with the vial. He stretched\nout his arm, reaching for it, but it was inches away, just beyond his\nfingertips …\nSnap. The vial fell into his palm. Wax spun in the air, downing half the\nvial. Like a burst of light, his steelsight returned. He passed between\nbuildings as he fell and Pushed himself, haphazardly, to the side. Bullets\nfrom above ripped through the air around him a moment later—the ground\napproaching at a frightening pace. At the last moment Wax threw the half-\nfull vial beneath him and Pushed.\nThe vial hit the ground and exploded, but the metal inside was enough\nof an anchor.

He slowed and hit the ground in a skid, mistcoat tassels flying\naround him. His heart thundering, he ripped his gun from its holster and\npointed upward.\nBut the sky was empty. The man had decided to cut his losses and flee.\nWax had landed in a city square with decorative paving stones and a few\nimpressive statues—designed in a strange chunky and blockish art style.\nHis drop had drawn … well, more than a little attention. It seemed he had\ninterrupted a dedication ceremony for a new building, for a journalist was\nthere with an evanotype stand for taking pictures.\nOne flash of light later, and Wax had the sinking realization that he\nwould be top-of-the-fold news in the afternoon broadsheets. Delightful. He\nstood up, calming himself, and took cover beneath an awning just in case.\nThen, as he was considering what to do next, a sleek black car rolled up and\nHoid the coachman, of all people, popped out—wearing a chauffeur’s cap\nand white gloves. What was he doing here?\n“Your carriage, sir,” Hoid said, gesturing.\n“How on Scadrial did you find me?” Wax asked.\nHoid cocked an eyebrow at the gathering crowd. “Pardon, Lord Ladrian,\nbut you do create quite a spectacle. It’s not terribly difficult to track you.”\nWell, that was fair. As the crowd started chattering, Wax could see the\nappeal of slipping into the car and driving off. But the others were still\nfighting for their lives.\n“Thanks, Hoid,” he said. “But Wayne and Marasi need me.” He\nlaunched into the air, drawing even more attention—and a second flash of\nlight from the evanotype machine.\n26\nMarasi reluctantly agreed to let the local constables handle cleaning up the\nsite—though she’d managed to retrieve two of her Allomantic grenades—\nand imprisoning the Set members they’d managed to capture. She disliked\nthe idea, as it would possibly mean the captives ended up in the Set’s hands.\nBut there wasn’t much she could do about that at the moment. Her wounded\nofficers were a more pressing concern.\nBeyond that … well, the moment Blantach and her people had arrived,\nthe entire mission had become a huge mess. Which was how—three hours\nafter rolling into Bilming—she found herself with Wayne, VenDell, and\nWax in a room of the Bilming Constabulary headquarters. She’d seen to her\npeople in the hospital, and was sitting with the casualty report.\nTwo dead constables. Rusts, it hurt to read their names. This was a\ndisaster.\nFor now though, she tried to keep her mind on their predicament. “So\nyou’re saying,” she said, “that Harmony is blind?”\nWax nodded, his eyes distant as he stood nearby, staring at the wall. “He\nsaid he’d send us what help he could. But he was frightened, Marasi.\nLegitimately frightened. And given what Steris and I uncovered … I worry\nour enemies are close to a weapon. Dangerously close.”\nHe glanced at her, then fell silent.

They didn’t want to say too much, in\ncase they were being observed. No one was at the door, but they could\nlisten in on this little room in other ways. Wan yellow walls and a free-\nhanging light bulb gave the place an intentionally bleak air. She bet they\nused it for interrogations.\nThe Bilming officers hadn’t locked the door—they wouldn’t dare—but\nWax and the others had been forced to surrender their weapons. And when\nthey’d been dropped off in here, the implication had been clear: Don’t try\nanything.\nThough they had been given four chairs, only Marasi sat—at the back of\nthe room. Wax paced in front of the door. VenDell sat on the floor by the\nwall, looking exhausted. He’d stitched up his bones, holding them in place\nwith sinew, making the features lumpy and unnatural. Like a ceramic\nsculpture that had been dropped, then glued back together with the pieces\nmisaligned.\nWayne was, of course, napping.\nOn the floor, hat over his eyes, rolled-up jacket under his head as a\npillow. Rusting man. She wished it were so easy for her. With two dead, she\nfelt her confidence crumbling. Cali Hatthew had been a constable for only\ntwo years—and had begged to come on this mission. That blood was on\nMarasi’s hands. She thought she’d planned well, but …\nWax walked over and squatted down. “Hey,” he said, “you all right?”\nShe shook her head, tapping the casualty report. “The two people who\nknew anything useful escaped, and I lost two good constables. At least a\ndozen others have serious wounds, and I caused a potential intercity\nincident. Oh, and the Set will have all their people released, just for an extra\nkick to the shins.”\nHe winced. “Marasi, we’re fighting some of the craftiest and most\npowerful people in the world. We are going to be outmaneuvered now and\nthen. You did well, keeping everyone as safe as possible.”\n“We’d be dead if you hadn’t arrived.”\n“But I did. You’re not a killer, Marasi. Not by trade. Your job is to\ninvestigate, plan, and enforce the law.”\n“And your job?” she asked.\nHe stood up. “I’m Harmony’s sword, Marasi. Recently taken off the\nweapon rack, the dust blown free. Regardless of what happened today, we\nneed to keep working. Because something big is happening in this city.\nSomething extremely dangerous. You lost two good people today—but they\ndied trying to prevent the deaths of millions.”\nShe nodded, rubbing her temples to try to banish her headache. If he and\nSteris were right … if the enemy was trying to sneak a bomb into\nElendel …\n“All right,” she said, trying to focus. “We need leads. What do we do\nnow that the Sequence escaped? Where do we look?”\n“Working on that,” he said. “The man I fought was spiked. So was the\nCycle you killed, as was the woman Wayne fought. Each of those spikes\nrequires the death of a Metalborn.”"

Each of those spikes\nrequires the death of a Metalborn.”\n“The kidnappings?” Marasi asked, her stomach turning.\nOver the last ten years, the Set’s primary activity—the one that had first\ndrawn Wax and Marasi’s attention—had been a series of kidnappings of\nwomen with strong Allomantic genetic lines. Research over the last few\nyears had proven they weren’t alone. Others, both men and women, had\nbeen vanishing—mostly from the Roughs, where such disappearances\nweren’t reported. Always Metalborn, or with Metalborn in their family\nlines.\nWax and Marasi’s worries about why had been disturbing. Now, to find\nmembers of the Set with access to so many powers …\n“We tried following the kidnappings, Wax,” she said. “Dead ends, every\none. Are we sure that Harmony didn’t see anything about this? Maybe\nbefore he was blinded?”\n“He can be cryptic, even to us,” VenDell said softly from where he sat\nby the wall. He glanced up at them, his broken face moving strangely. “But\nI don’t think he knows where those people went. When we were hunting for\nthem, we wondered why Harmony didn’t feed us more information. Why he\ndidn’t look into the secret parts of the world and tell us. I think he’s been\nunable to see details for some time. But he’s been … concealing his\ndisability from us.”\nThe kandra sighed, suddenly looking tired—his skin going transparent\nand faintly green. “And … there’s more, Waxillium. He tries to hide it, but I\nthink … something is wrong with Harmony. I see a dark shadow behind\nhim.”\n“What good is it having God on your side,” Marasi said, folding her\narms, “if he doesn’t do anything to help?”\n“He did do something to help,” Wax replied. “He sent us. A lesson he\nkeeps trying to teach me.”\n“I will contact him,” VenDell said, “and request further aid. But\nWaxillium is right … Constable Colms, we are his attempt to do\nsomething.”\nWax turned to the side, his expression again distant. He hadn’t told her\neverything that had happened to him years ago. She thought maybe Wax\nhad died for a moment. Before she’d found him broken in that cold,\nforgotten shrine. He’d met with Harmony.\nNow Wax talked like this sometimes. With an authority regarding\nreligious matters that she hadn’t heard from priests.\nThe door opened, and Captain Blantach walked in. She’d changed to a\nclean uniform, and had obviously run a comb through her short blonde hair,\nbut she still appeared frazzled. Perhaps because of the man who walked in\nbehind her.\nOh hell, Marasi thought. She brought the mayor.\n27\nWax sighed. This had just become a political matter rather than a\njurisdictional one. Granted, the entire day had been heading that direction\nlike a galloping stagecoach with no driver. He glanced at Marasi, who\nnodded.

Two years ago he’d landed in Bilming—at the very center of Outer\nCities politics—and had somehow proven himself to be the exact sort of\nperson they wanted “standing up” to tyrannical Elendel.\nToday he was dressed in formal wear, and even checked his cufflinks as\nthey entered—no doubt to show off the sparkling diamonds set into the\nwood. Slicked-back black hair, a chin you could use to cut the tops off tin\ncans. And, of course, his characteristic smug smile.\nLord mayor of Bilming was an important position—probably the most\nimportant one outside of Elendel. Which meant Wax had to be careful not to\ninsult him. This would be a delicate conversation.\n“Oi!” Wayne said, sitting up. “Hey, Wax! Somebody done sewn a sack\nof dicks together and made a person! It’s even walking!”\nThe room fell silent. Then VenDell snickered.\n“Are you going to apologize for that, Ladrian?” Gave asked.\n“Oh!” Wayne said, heaving himself to his feet. “It’s Gave Entrone.\nSorry, Lord Mayor! I mistook you for something else. Though the\nresemblance, it’s downright uncanny, it is.”\n“Wayne?” Wax said.\n“Yeah, boss?”\n“Please stop helping.”\n“Got it.”\nWax’s and Entrone’s eyes locked. Wax was certain the man had ties to\nthe Set. A partial explanation for his exceptional rise through Outer Cities\npolitics.\n“So, here we are,” Gave said, rubbing his hands together. “Waxillium\nLadrian. The great lawman of the Roughs. Involved in an illegal operation\nin my city!”\n“We have jurisdiction here!” Marasi said. “By the code—”\n“Code seventeen of the United Justice Act?” Gave said. “We repealed\nthat, you recall? Three months ago.”\n“You can’t repeal it,” Wax said. “You don’t have the authority.”\n“We don’t have authority?” Entrone said. “To have a say in the policing\nof our own city? Why, that is an arrogant thing to assert, wouldn’t you say,\nCaptain Blantach?”\n“It’s technically true, Lord Mayor,” she replied.\n“Technically,” he said, “one of those dirty maskers from the South could\npass a law saying they have ‘jurisdiction’ here. But what right would they\nhave?” He had walked a circuit of the room and halted in front of Wax.\n“They aren’t one of our kind.”\n“I see what you’re doing, Entrone,” Wax said softly.\n“Do you?” he whispered, getting close enough that Wax could smell the\nmint on his breath. “Do you truly appreciate how delicious this is?

And the Supremacy Bill? Well, by\ninsisting Elendel had authority to override local authority, Wax would prove\nhimself a hypocrite. That would give more fuel to the war between Elendel\nand the Outer Cities. Exactly what this man wanted.\nEntrone smiled. Showing no teeth. Just two smug lips that would look\nso much better split and bloodied. Wax restrained himself with effort.\nRuin, I hate this man, he thought.\n“Perhaps,” VenDell said, standing up, “you might be willing to listen to\na … higher authority, Lord Mayor.” The kandra made his skin turn fully\ntransparent, showing the bones underneath—the skull behind his face,\ncracked and stuck together with sinew. It was an eerie sight, particularly\nsince VenDell chose to leave the eyeballs normal—and they seemed to float\nin the jelly that his face had become.\n“Ah!” Entrone said. “One of the puppets!

Not some priest who managed to slurp up\nsome juice left by a long-dead entity. Oh! Look, Captain Blantach! It\npretends to be shocked by my words!”\n“He doesn’t pretend,” Wax said. “VenDell is a person like any of us.\nMerely a little more … malleable.”\n“Oh, Ladrian,” Entrone said, then had the audacity to pat Wax on the\narm. “So easily fooled. Kandra are animals. Puppets. Why, they aren’t even\nreally alive. They’re mistwraiths pretending to be people, and I fail to see\nhow I’m to be intimidated by a talking piece of slime that…”\nHe trailed off as he noticed that Wayne, subtly, had edged up close to\nhim.\n“… a piece of slime,” Gave continued, “that … er…”\n“Keep goin’,” Wayne said, his eyes alarmingly wide. “Keep insultin’ my\nfriends.

Am I actually …\nyour friend?”\n“Sure,” Wayne said. “I mean, you’re the stuck-up one that we make fun\nof, but every crew needs one of those.” He pointed at Wax, then Marasi,\nthen VenDell. “Mine has three. Five if you include Steris, since she counts\nfer two. But you can never have too many.”\n“I … see,” VenDell said, scratching the side of his head.\n“Point is,” Wayne continued, “we can make fun of you because we like\nyou. That’s how it works. Anybody else does it, and we ram a dueling cane\nup a part of them that I can’t mention, ’cuz I’m working on my language.”\n“You are?” Marasi said.\n“Yup.

He could\nwalk out of here and ignore Entrone. But that would add another piece of\nwood to the fire—stoking civil war. Beyond that, could he continue to\ninvestigate in the city without being hounded by constables at every step?\nHow does the bomb factor into this? Wax thought. The talk of ashfalls.\nMy sister. What is really going on?\nHe might have a way to find answers. He felt inside his belt, which he’d\nrecovered and refilled from his ammo stash—the large duffel he’d brought\nand hidden on top of a building.

He pulled the trellium\nearring out and slipped it into his ear.\nHe felt a jolt and a disconnect, like the coach he was riding in had hit a\nbump. Different from when he talked to Harmony. Then he felt drawn\ntoward something powerful. A vibration ran through him, forceful, violent.\nHe gasped, the room fuzzing around him.\nImmediately, a familiar voice pierced his mind like a spike to the brain.\nFaster.

Ah … It is. I can sense you. Found yourself a\ntrellium earring, did you? Clever. Your idea, or was it that god of yours?\n“Hello, Telsin,” he whispered. No use trying to lie. She could feel him,\nas clearly as he felt her. He tried to summon some familial emotion. But\nright now, he felt only haunted by that voice. It was an echo from a long-\nlost time. A time he’d left behind, but which wouldn’t leave him.\nSo, you’re in Bilming. She sounded amused. Your arrival made a\ncharacteristic amount of noise. Good to see that nothing changes. You\nnever could make anything useful of yourself unless you also made a huge\nmess for me.\n“Telsin,” he said softly, “what are you doing?”\nWhat needs to be done, Brother. As always.\n“I…”\nWhat could he say? All of his objections felt hollow. “You’ll get\nmillions killed”? Six years ago, she’d been willing to let her own people die\nto achieve her goals. She wouldn’t care about the people of Elendel. “You’ll\nbetray our people”? She’d been willing to betray him. “You’re playing with\nforces beyond your control.” That was the sort of thing she liked, always\ndancing closer to the flame.\nWhat did he hope to accomplish? He should have thought this through.\nHe knew better than to walk into the enemy’s den without a plan.\nAh, Wax, Telsin said in his mind. Still pretending, aren’t you? Telling\nyourself that you’re the hero? Where was that hero when our family needed\nhim? Off playing in the Roughs. Running from real responsibility.\nI’ll tell you what I’m doing. What needs to be done. This world, and\neveryone on it, is doomed. Unless I intervene. The same way I had to step\nup and lead after you ran off. You aren’t the hero, Waxillium. You never\nwere.

In my right, I held my\numbrella at ready.\nWe entered the mist, and just as I predicted, Vila’s form emerged, arcing\ntoward us until we collided.\n“Where’s the key!” Vila said.\n“Far away from here by now,” I replied with a smile."

Known as Ironeyes, the ancient Inquisitor had weighty spikes through\nhis eyes, the points jutting out the back of his skull. One of his eye sockets\nhad been crushed during a fight, as recorded in the Words of Founding that\nHarmony—Sazed—had left. Wax could make out the scars, intermingled\nwith faded tattoos, outlining the eye sockets.\nDeath wore voluminous black robes and had ghostly skin—looking ill.\nThe hands jutting from his sleeves were so lean they appeared skeletal. Wax\nhad grown accustomed to speaking with beings out of myth; the kandra,\neven TenSoon, were practically mundane to him these days. But he still felt\nan unsettling disquiet at seeing Ironeyes. This being was said to escort the\nsouls of the dead to the Beyond.\nThe entire room outside—filled with desks, constables, and underlings\n—had grown silent. No one dared turn a page of paperwork; they all stared\nat that figure silhouetted against the brazen sunlight behind. Something\nemanated from him. A dread that crushed the soul like a hand around\nyesterday’s broadsheet. A …\nNo, Wax thought. I do not fear this. I’ve stared down death already.\nStrangely, the sensation of dread evaporated from him. Had that been …\nemotional Allomancy? It was difficult to recognize in the throes of it, but it\nappeared obvious in hindsight. Yet this time it didn’t affect Wax as it did\neveryone else, including Marasi, judging by how pale her face had gone.\nWax took a deep breath, pushed open the door, and strode out past the\nguard. Wax walked through the center of the room and met up with\nIroneyes, who was uncommonly tall. As Wax had always imagined,\nactually.\n“Sword,” Death said, focusing spikes upon him. “We need to speak.”\nWax gestured into the room with the others, and Death walked past the\nstunned constables, though one—bearing the shoulder patch of a Seeker—\nmanaged to pull out a gun. Not a move Wax would have advised. All Death\ndid was wave absently and Pull the gun across the room to catch it.

But damn, the\npower involved …\nThe gun dropped to the floor, and as Wax and Death reached the door,\nthey saw that Entrone and Blantach had stepped out of an office, their eyes\nwide.\n“Ah,” Ironeyes said, focusing on the lord mayor. “Gave. I never cared\nmuch for the members of House Entrone I knew during my mortality.”\n“I…” Entrone said. “This is my prisoner. Who…”\n“I require privacy,” Ironeyes said. “You will return to these mortals their\nweapons. Once our conference is finished, you will impede their\ninvestigation in this city no further.”\n“I’m not of your religion…”\n“Death is not a religion,” Ironeyes said. “It is a fact.”\n“But—”\n“How would you like to die, mortal?” Ironeyes asked, stepping closer,\nrobes billowing around him. “And when? Quietly? In the night, of a failing\nheart? Drowning, on one of your new ships as it sinks? Here? Right now?\nCrushed by the weight of your own stupidity?”\nEntrone licked his lips, then whispered, “As you demand, Ironeyes, it\nshall be done.” It appeared that he could indeed be superstitious without\nbeing religious.\nWax walked into the room, and Ironeyes swept in after. “Wayne,” Death\nsaid softly, closing the door, “kindly watch the door to make certain we are\nnot observed or listened to.”\n“Uh, sure,” Wayne said, scrambling over to the door and its window.\n“They’re all just standin’ out there. ’Cept the few that have fainted. Neat.”\nHe glanced at Ironeyes. “That accent of yours … real old, real\ninteresting … I actually kinda got it right.”\nDeath sank down into a chair and seemed to age suddenly. Wrinkles\nsank from the corners of his eyes, crossing his face, and his jowls sagged.\nHe sighed loudly, tipping his metal eyes toward the ceiling. “Lord Ruler,”\nhe muttered. “That was a performance, wasn’t it? And to think that I was\nthe reasonable one in the crew.”\nMarasi and Wax shared a glance.\n“Ironeyes?” Marasi asked. “Are you … well?”\n“No,” he said. “I run low on atium, and so age finally emerges from the\nshadows. It has always stalked me. Now it senses the kill. I was here in\nBilming, seeking answers. They try to re-create the metal, and I thought\nmaybe…”\n“If you run out…” Marasi said, “… you die?”\nHe nodded. “I was going to let it happen. I have lived so much, far\nlonger than my due. But I helped destroy this world—unwillingly, yes, but\nmy weakness led to much sorrow. I swore I would help. And so, I struggle\nyet to live…”\nRusts. Death took a deep breath, and the lines on his face retreated—\nthen regrew when he exhaled. It looked like he was vacillating between\ndecades of age with each breath."

It looked like he was vacillating between\ndecades of age with each breath.\n“Trell wants to own this planet,” Death whispered. “So your time\ndwindles, as does mine.” He studied Wax with those inscrutable not-eyes.\n“I’ve grown too weak to continue hunting those who would destroy this\nland. My display earlier will get you out of this room, perhaps convince the\nlocal constables to leave you alone, but that … might be all I can offer.”\nWax knelt beside the aging demigod, a thought striking him. “You were\nin the city, hunting for atium. Why?”\n“Because someone here is trying to split harmonium,” he explained.\n“And create the metal again. Though making lerasium would be far more\ndangerous…”\n“Do you know what happens?” Marasi asked. “When someone tries to\nsplit harmonium?”\nDeath shook his head.\n“An explosion,” Wax said. “A big explosion. It’s what we’re trying to\nstop. Do you have any leads?”\n“One, perhaps,” Death said, thoughtful. “A man vanished two weeks\nago. I only just ran across his name: Tobal Copper. He made some kind of\nlegal disturbance that mentioned splitting harmonium in the months before\nhe disappeared. Finding out what happened to him would have been my\nnext step.”\nWax nodded. A lead—a slim one, but still somewhere to start. The way\nhis sister talked … it made him feel an increasing urgency.\n“Ironeyes?” Marasi asked, stepping over.\n“You may call me Marsh,” he said softly. “It … feels good to hear that\nname. To remember what I used to be.”\n“Marsh,” she said. “How did you crush that gun?”\n“Duralumin,” he said absently, “and a lot of practice. Listen, child.\nHarmony is growing increasingly indecisive. He denies it, but I see it. That\ngives Autonomy—Trell, the god of the outworlders—a chance to move in.\nShe seeks to eliminate us from the stage of galactic politics before we even\nstep onto it, and her followers are already armed with Hemalurgy. You\nstudied the book I gave you?”\n“Yes,” she said. “And Waxillium practically memorized it.” Wax nodded\nin agreement.\n“Your enemy,” Death said softly, “has learned how to circumvent one of\nthe most important limitations to Hemalurgy: her agents bear too many\nspikes. That should open them to Harmony’s influence, but it doesn’t. Either\nHarmony is too weak to exploit what they’ve done, or they’ve found a way\nto use Trell’s own metal to offset the weakness.\n“This is extremely dangerous. So far, I do not believe they’ve learned\nthe secret to Compounding via Hemalurgy. Identity contamination prevents\nit; that is our only saving grace. If they could do that … or, Lord Ruler … if\nthey get atium, or lerasium…”\n“So … what do we do?” Wayne asked from the door.\n“What we’ve always done,” Marsh said. “Survive.” He looked to Wax\nagain. “The people of Bilming think they are accomplishing so much,"

It is all part of Trell’s plan\nsomehow. Be warned. Be careful. She steers them. I’ve been … dull of\nmind lately, as I try to fight off what is happening to me.”\n“We’ll stop them,” Marasi said. “I promise it, Marsh.”\nWayne waved to them. A moment later, an attendant arrived with their\nweapons and equipment. She then withdrew to let them rearm.\n“Marsh,” Marasi said, slipping a small handgun into her shoulder bag,\n“have you ever seen a symbol like this?” She quickly sketched three\ninterlocking diamonds in her notepad. They reminded Wax of something.\nSome architectural designs from around Elendel?\nYes, he thought. Near the Field of Rebirth. Actually, it resembled the\nthree-petal shape of a Marewill flower.\n“This is my brother’s symbol,” Marsh said. “He does what he thinks is\nbest. As has always been the case with him. He … is not the best at self-\nreflection, but he does want to protect Scadrial. His agents will align with\nyour interests.”\n“I think I saw through his eyes,” Wax said. “Once, years ago. Is he still\nalive? The Survivor?”\n“Alive?” Marsh asked. “It depends, I suppose, on your definition. He’s\nclose to alive. How is that?”\n“You mean … he’s a ghost?” Wayne asked.\n“After a fashion,” Marsh replied. “He’s less alive than I am, but perhaps\nmore than other ghosts? It’s hard to say. Three of us remain from that\noriginal crew. After all this time. Only three. Legs to a tripod, balancing one\nanother. And without one … I do not know what would happen.”\nWax didn’t know what to make of that. Still, it felt good to strap his\nguns back on, and they had a lead now. A name and, it appeared, permission\nto leave this office without being chased. He’d take it, even if Death himself\nwas …\n“I will stay here,” VenDell said as they gathered at the door. “I will\nensure that Lord Ironeyes is cared for, and look after the constables in the\nhospital. I … do not think I will be of further value to your investigation.”\n“As you wish,” Wax said.\n“Just remember what you know, Lord Ladrian,” VenDell said. “What\nyou said earlier. Harmony puts people where they need to be, but then they\nmust act. It is his way.”\nWax nodded. “Wayne, Marasi—are you ready?”\n“I am,” Marasi said, slinging her bag over her shoulder.\nThey looked to Wayne, who put his hands on his hips. “Did either of\nyou know that ghosts was real?”\n“Does it matter?” Marasi asked.\n“Does it matter if ghosts are real?” Wayne said. “I think it matters,\nMarasi. I think it rusting does!”\n“I’m told it is better to refer to them as Cognitive Shadows,” Marsh\nmumbled.\n“Wayne,” Wax said, “can we please focus?”"

Dark gods. Death himself dyin’. Rusting\nghosts. Guess we gotta keep goin’, but after this, I don’t wanna see anyone\ncomplainin’ when I’ve traded for someone’s favorite shoes or whatnot. Hear\nme?”\nTogether they marched out through the quiet constabulary office and\ninto the sunlight.\n29\nRight, Marasi thought, trying to pull her emotions together. Conversation\nwith Death. Just another everyday conversation with Death himself …\nShe couldn’t blame Wayne for feeling out of sorts. But they had to stay\nfocused. Unfortunately, she and the others hadn’t even reached the bottom\nof the constabulary office steps before someone came running down after\nthem. Flushed from exertion—and perhaps stress—Blantach looked a great\ndeal less sure of herself now than she had earlier.\nMarasi stepped forward to meet Blantach. “Yes?”\n“He’s going to send people after you,” she said. “As soon as he gets\nover the shock of what happened in there with … you-know-who. I know\nLord Entrone. He takes a great deal of pride in how ‘modern’ and ‘forward\nthinking’ he is. He’ll decide you tricked him, and will send constables to\narrest you.”\nWax groaned softly, stepping up behind them. “We don’t have time to\ndodge patrols.”\n“Look,” Blantach said, “I … have no idea what’s going on in this city. I\nthought I did. Until…” She glanced at the office building and shivered. “I\nhad my illusions shattered quite violently. Something dangerous is going on\nhere.”\n“More than dangerous, Blantach,” Marasi said. “Catastrophic.”\n“Right. Right,” Blantach said. “Was that really … you know…?”\n“Yes,” Marasi said. “I’ve met him before.”\n“Rusts…” Blantach took a deep breath and turned to face them again. “I\nthink I can keep Entrone off your back if you let me send an officer with\nyou.”\n“Out of the question,” Wax said.\nBlantach stepped closer and met his eyes. “Listen. This is my city. I\ndon’t know what—or who—you’re afraid of, but I’m not part of it. I want\nto help, and this is the only thing I can think of. If you have a Bilming\nofficer with you, I can persuade Entrone I’ve got someone watching you.”\nShe turned, gesturing, and a figure came scrambling down the steps,\nnearly tripping at the end. The slender woman pushed her overly large\nspectacles up on her face, but that nearly made her drop the three ledgers\nshe was trying to carry. Shoulder-length black hair fell around her face as\nshe struggled to keep the ledgers in hand. She pushed it back and grinned\nsheepishly—through lips with bright red lipstick.\nIt was Moonlight."

Marasi, though, felt maybe she could trust the\nwoman. A little. After all, Marsh had said that people with the interlocking\ndiamond tattoos would be on their side.\nMoonlight saluted Wax. “I promise to be of use, sir, and not get in your\nway.” She grimaced. “Except maybe by accident.”\n“I think we should bring her,” Marasi said.\nWax nodded. “You’re on the team then, Kim. Let’s see if you can be of\nuse. A man named Tobal Copper vanished in this city recently. I want to\ntrack down where he lived and interrogate anyone who might have known\nhim.”\n“Oh!” Moonlight said. “I don’t have that kind of information on me, of\ncourse. I just carry around the city maps and details! But I can get you into\nthe records office! We should be able to find answers there.”\n“Which will let them know what we’re doing,” Wax said. “The Set is\nsure to have agents in such an important place.”\n“I doubt there’s another way to get this information,” Marasi said.\n“We’ll just have to move quickly, to stay ahead of them.”\n“Agreed,” Wax said after a moment’s thought. “Lead on, Kim.

Marasi had been forced to spend many\nan hour in closets, searching through thick ledgers of names or broadsheet\narchives.\nThis building, however, was a sleek silvery structure, each side more\nwindow than wall. Blantach led them inside herself, and a flash of her\nconstable’s credentials got them assigned a flock of junior researchers\nbefore she bade the group farewell.\nIn minutes, Marasi and the others were sitting in comfortable chairs in a\nglass-walled meeting room, sipping tea while waiting for the results.

My mentor is worried about\ntheir connections to Harmony.”\nMarasi stopped in the hallway, which was empty save for them. “I’m not\ngoing to lie to my companions, Moonlight.”\n“You already have.”\n“Only to avoid revealing you to Blantach,” Marasi said.\n“And do you assume those two tell you everything about their lives?”\nMoonlight said. “Every little detail?”\n“The important ones.”\n“What did Waxillium and Harmony discuss when he died?”\n“That’s … not important.”\n“Seems to me that it is.” Moonlight stepped around Marasi to stand right\nin front of her. Not really blocking her way, but making certain Marasi met\nher eyes. “Do you want answers? We have those. Do you want to protect\nScadrial? That’s our main purpose. But we can’t move in the open. That\ninvites our enemies to strike—beings like Trell are too powerful and\nHarmony is too indecisive. What’s he doing to help?”\n“He sent us,” Marasi said.\n“He tossed you into the line of fire and said, ‘Good luck!’ It’s not his\nfault—my mentor speaks of him quite fondly. But the reality of your\nplanet’s situation is dire, and so we must move in the shadows. And our\nsecrets must be maintained—known only by those who have proven\nthemselves.”\n“Wax is the single most ‘proven’ man alive.”\n“We’re not interested in him,” Moonlight said. “We’re interested in you.\nDoesn’t it excite you, to know things that he doesn’t—things almost no one\nelse does? The secrets of the cosmere itself?”\n“I don’t need to keep secrets from others to feel special.”\nMoonlight smiled. “I believe you. How interesting. Well, for now I’m\ndemanding you keep my secret. That’s the cost of my aid. I have met"

You need me. But if you tell anyone\nabout me, I’ll leave.”\n“That’s your play? Extortion?”\n“Extortion?” Moonlight said. “It’s just a deal. I have agency, Marasi. I\ndon’t have to help you. I have a lead now—I can probably find my way to\nthis Tobal Copper’s place on my own long before you.” She shrugged.\n“Waxillium trusts you. He’ll understand when you explain why you\ncouldn’t tell him.”\nShe stepped aside and continued down the hallway, her mannerisms\nchanging as she reached the meeting room door. She became jumpy and\nexcited, and—after first pushing on it and blushing when it didn’t budge—\npulled it open.\nMarasi continued on her way, uncertain. There was something about\nhow Moonlight talked … Chasing petty thugs, or even mobsters with\ndangerous intentions, had once thrilled Marasi. But the more she learned of\nthe world and the forces moving in it, the less satisfied she was.\nLong ago, she’d explained to Wax her philosophy on becoming a\nconstable. She’d envisioned making the entire city safer—not by chasing\ncriminals, but by changing the way people and neighborhoods saw\nthemselves. Lock a man in prison, and you might stop him from committing\ncrimes. Teach a man to respect himself and his community, and you stopped\neveryone he might have taught, recruited, or bullied.\nShe didn’t want to focus on individuals. She wanted to change the\nworld. At least, that was how she’d thought when she’d first dreamed of\nbecoming a constable. Had she let the day-to-day grind of the job turn her\ninto something else?\nBy the time she returned from sending Allik the message, the research\nteam had already arrived with answers—and was spreading out relevant\nbroadsheets and city records for Wax. Marasi stepped up beside him—\nMoonlight sat primly in the corner with a disarming grin on her face.\nWayne was pretending to nap, but he had one eye cracked, watching\nMoonlight.\nDon’t overdo the act, Moonlight, Marasi thought with satisfaction. He’ll\ncatch you.\n“Tobal Copper,” one of the researchers was saying, pointing at a listing.\n“Age fifty-three. A chemist, specializing in rubber and manufacturing.\nWorked for Basin Tires, making … well, tires.”\n“He lost his job,” another explained, “about five years ago for … erratic\nbehavior.”\n“Which means what, exactly?” Marasi said, surveying the papers set out\non the long table.\n“Well,” the lead researcher said—a Terriswoman with curly hair and a V\npattern on her shirt. “We pulled most of this information from a lawsuit he\nfiled against his former employer. Seems that they … um … ‘refused to\nlisten to his vital discoveries about the impending end of the world.’”\nWax and Marasi shared a look.\n“Go on,” Wax said.\n“There’s not a lot to tell, unfortunately,” the researcher said. “The\nlawsuit was dismissed before reaching even the first stage of trial. In this, he"

In this, he\nmentions pamphlets he’d created, but that’s not the sort of record we\narchive. Instead we have his legal case, his apartment lease, and one police\nblotter record of an arrest.”\n“For disturbing the peace,” the junior researcher said. “He was banging\non the doors in his apartment complex, yelling that ‘They’ve almost split\nharmonium, and when they do, it’s going to destroy us all.’”\n“We’ll leave you with the information,” the lead researcher said, patting\nthe papers on the desk. “And we’ll keep searching—but I doubt we’ll turn\nup anything else. We keep careful track of the names of anyone arrested, for\ncross-referencing, and these were the only three hits.”\n“One more thing, if you don’t mind,” Marasi said as they prepared to\nleave. “Can you find any reports of food shipments vanishing? Particularly\nnonperishable items?”\n“Oh, that’s been happening steadily for two years now,” the lead\nresearcher said. “Captain Blantach has us watching for such reports, as she\nfinds it baffling. Why would the city’s criminal underground be so\ninterested in canned beans?”\n“Why indeed,” Marasi said, lifting up a sheet from the lawsuit\ndocuments. Where Copper had claimed, Someone is building shelters\nagainst a cataclysm, maintained by inexplicable technology. The city\ngovernment is in on it, and so were my employers! They fired me because I\ngot too close to the truth. You have to listen. They’re splitting harmonium,\nand once they do, they’ll make bombs to turn us into turtles.\nThat … last part seemed a little far-fetched.\nThe researchers vanished out the door, leaving Marasi and Wax to read\nover the three documents in turn. Unfortunately, it wasn’t a lot to go on. The\nblotter said that after Tobal Copper had calmed, they’d released him. He\nhad not reoffended.\nThe last sheet gave an address in an area the researcher said was\nexpensive. Marasi supposed a head chemist would be paid well.\n“They probably killed him,” Wax said softly, “once the hubbub died\ndown—so it wouldn’t look too suspicious.”\n“Possibly,” Marasi said. “But it’s equally likely they grabbed him to\nmake him work on their projects.”\n“Death said he vanished two weeks ago,” Wax said. “This trail might be\ncold already.”\n“But it’s the best one we have,” Marasi said.\n“Agreed. Kim, do you know where this apartment address is located?”\n30\nThe apartment building didn’t look much like a plateau.\nWayne stood with the others, hands on his hips, staring up at the thing. It\nwas too shiny, with too many windows—like a big bottle of something\nexpensive. Buildings shouldn’t look like that; they should look like bricks.\nAnd have alleys that smelled of what came out of a fellow after he’d had a\nbottle of something too expensive.\nMost of all, he’d expected a plateau.\nNo, wait, he realized. There’s a canyon next. That’s how the story goes.\nWe gotta find that first."

That’s how the story goes.\nWe gotta find that first.\nComforted, he followed Marasi, Wax, and that Kim woman who tried\ntoo hard to be fiddly. The foyer had a doorman and everything. This place\nwas fancy. Maybe Wayne should buy a building like that. A doorman sure\nwould be helpful in carrying him up to his flat after he’d had too many\nbottles of something expensive.\nOr, well, more often he had bottles of something cheap as piss. Just\nbecause he was secretly rich and posh didn’t mean he couldn’t appreciate\nterrible booze anymore. He merely had to call it “retro” or “authentic” or\nsomething.\nThe doorman sent for the building manager, who turned out to be a man\nshaped kind of like a brick—so that was a nice nod to proper building\nprotocol. Marasi and Wax explained they needed to investigate the missing\nman’s apartment, while Wayne took a long walk around the foyer with its\nenormous paintings of people dancing. They wore suits and dresses, their\nlegs stretched really long, their backs all straight, as if they were made of\nrulers and not flesh.\nWas this the canyon from the story? Ma had said it was beautiful. But\nno. This didn’t work. No self-respecting canyon would have pictures of\ndancing folks on the walls.\nAnd why did he assume this would be like the story? Well, because he’d\nthought of it, he supposed. Once you had a thought, you had to keep ahold\nof it. That was how things was.\nThe building manager listened to Wax and Marasi’s explanations,\nsquinted at Kim’s credentials, then grunted. He pointed the way to the\nelevator, and they all squeezed in.\nWayne didn’t much like elevators. It wasn’t just being trapped in a little\nbox, or not knowin’ how it worked and needin’ to rely upon an operator. It\nwasn’t that you could smell everyone a little too much when pressed\ntogether, or couldn’t see where you were going, which ruined the\nexperience of going up high.\nWait. No, it probably was that last one. Elevators were like a carnival\nride designed by an overprotective parent who didn’t want you getting\nscared or actually having any fun. He’d had more faith in them when they’d\nbeen moved by people, not electricity. Folks were overly trusting of this\nstrange power what leaked from sockets in the walls. After all, Wayne was a\nprimary investor in the technology, and that should have been a big red flag\nfor everyone.\nOn the twenty-second floor, at the end of a long hallway, the building\nmanager used a set of keys to open a door into a large apartment. He\ngestured for them to enter, with a grunt.\n“Anyone else been in here?” Wax asked.\n“No,” the manager said.\n“He’s been gone for two weeks,” Wax said. “And nobody came\nlooking? No constables? No family?”\nThe manager shook his head, grunted, then left them—apparently\nwanting nothing to do with constables.\n“Wonder what his problem is,” Marasi said, shutting the door behind\nthem."

One wall had narrow floor-to-\nceiling windows overlooking the city, with steel girders between. The wall\nto its right was filled with bookshelves. There was a stylish sitting area to\nthe left, with a smart yellow rug and black furniture. Everything was\nexceptionally neat, though keeping your place clean was probably easy\nwhen you was either dead or vanished.\n“So,” Marasi said, “they grabbed him or killed him. Then left this\napartment alone and visibly pristine. Trap?”\n“Trap,” Wax said, with a nod. “Give me a minute to use Allomancy to\nscan about.”\nTurned out it’s really tough to make an explosive trap without some\nmetal, even using modern clay explosives. They found three tripwires and\none pressure plate, each hooked to a doozy of a grenade. The Set evidently\ndidn’t care about a little collateral damage.\n“So, whoever you’re chasing,” Kim said, wringing her hands nervously,\n“they got here before us. Rusts. I didn’t know what I was in for…”\n“They were undoubtedly behind Copper’s disappearance,” Wax said.\n“Be careful, everyone. There might be a trap we missed. Kim, would you\nencourage anyone in the neighboring apartments to leave for the next\nhour?”\nShe left to do so, and the rest of them set to some familiar work: going\nover a scene for clues. Kim returned a short time later while Wayne was\ninspecting the writing desk near the bookshelves. She knelt down beside\nhim, looking up at the bottom as he knocked for secret compartments.\n“Um…” she said, still acting uncertain, “I did as you asked. But … why\nare we bothering to search? Your enemy has been over this place\nthoroughly.”\n“Sure,” Wayne said. “I can even prove it. See these little drill holes? You\nmake those to be extra sure there’s no secret compartments, but only if you\nwant to leave the furniture in one piece. Which is less fun … but sometimes\nthere are good reasons. Like if you want the room to look normal to a bunch\nof constables when they visit, so they’ll be more likely to get themselves\nexploded.”\n“So what is there to learn?”\n“Well, you see, this is a kind of fight,” Wayne said. “A back-and-forth. A\ndance. They set those traps in case someone dangerous got wind of the Set.\nYou don’t need to blow up ordinary constables. Just the extraordinary\nkind.”\n“Like you?”\n“Hell no,” Wayne said, then pointed to Marasi, searching through books,\nthen to Wax, knocking against the far wall and listening for compartments.\n“You see those two? They represent the best of two worlds. Wax, now, he’s\ninstinct. He’s lived a lot, been shot at a lot. He didn’t have the schooling to\nbe a constable—he spent his school years learning from Terris scholars\nabout old things people wrote a long time ago."

She’s spent her life studying how to do\nthis sort of nonsense. Sometimes I think she must have read more books on\nbeing a constable than have ever actually been written. She talks of crime\npatterns, preventing chains of poverty, and smart things what make you\nthink maybe being a constable is about math.\n“Put the two of them together, and you’ve got both. Instinct and\nknowledge. Practice and application. The enemy, they looked this place\nover, sure. They had first crack at it. But they left bombs. That whispers that\nthey’re worried they missed something. And so the dance, the fight. Can we\nfind what they didn’t?”\n“Curious,” she said. “And what do you add to the team?”\n“Comic relief.”\nShe cocked an eyebrow.\n“Maybe a little whimsy,” he said. “Improvisation. Vision.”\n“You have a broad imagination, then?”\n“There are broads in my imagination almost all the time.”\nThat provoked a smile. Seemed like a nice enough person, when she\nwasn’t pretending. Course, she was probably a traitor of some sort. Shame\nabout that.\n“Hey, Wax,” Wayne said. “Look at this.”\nWax joined him a moment later, inspecting the bottom envelope in a\nstack from the desk drawer.\n“What’s that?” Kim asked.\n“When you use a fountain pen,” Wayne said, “you gotta wait for it to\ndry. But sometimes you’re inna hurry, or you’re worried, so you put it away\nand put something on toppa it. Like this stack of envelopes. Then the ink\nmakes an imprint on the bottom.”\n“Smudged,” Wax said, holding up the envelope. “But maybe legible.\nThis part here, it’s underlined. Does that look like a set of numbers to you?”\n“A seven?” Wayne asked, pointing at one. The next were too smudged\nto read. “Then a dash and a thirteen.”\n“Maybe a combination,” Kim said softly, crowding them to see the\nnumber. “There are big stacks of lockers at the larger train stations that use\nnumbers like this, where you can pay to store things.”\nWax nodded slowly. “Marasi, what have you found?”\n“I think these books have all been replaced,” she said. “He seems like\nthe type who reads a lot, but these are all brand new. I’d guess the Set took\nevery book in the place, just in case, and refilled the bookshelves with red\nherrings.”\n“This looks like the original furniture though,” Wax said, and\ndemonstrated moving a chair back so it bumped the wall, right where the\npaint had been scraped away by repeatedly being hit like that. “It’s old.\nWorn. The carpet too. The room appears neat and orderly, because the Set\ncleaned it up after they did their search—but it was likely a mess before\nthey arrived.”\n“I think the fellow is dead,” Wayne said, tapping the wall and breaking\naway some putty. “Bullet hole. Probably shot the poor doof in the back\nwhile he was sitting here.”"

Probably shot the poor doof in the back\nwhile he was sitting here.”\n“Too specific a conclusion to draw from so little evidence,” Marasi said,\njoining him. She pulled out a little brush and fiddled in the hole, eventually\npulling out some flakes of something and putting them in a vial.\n“Blood?” Wayne guessed.\n“Yes,” she admitted. “And what might be a sliver of bone. They must\nhave cleaned the blood off the desk, but removed only the bullet from the\nhole.” She ran her fingers over the wood. “It’s worn down. He used this\ndesk a lot. Or bought an old one to begin with. Hard to say.”\nWax walked over and handed Wayne a leather cap, like painters wore.\n“Found it on the bedpost,” Wax said. “What do you think? Have we\ngiven you enough to work with?”\n“Maybe…” Wayne said, slipping on the hat. He walked to the center of\nthe room, then stared out a window, putting it all together. Trying to\nimagine the man who had lived here, trying to extrapolate from what they\nknew of him.\n“He was respected at first,” Wayne said. “A good scientist. But then he\nfound things, heard other things, learned more. He was a chemist, right?”\n“For a tire company,” Marasi said.\n“A front, most likely,” Wax said. “He said his employers were making a\nbomb. I’d bet his chemistry work involved investigating weapon systems\nand explosives for the Bilming government.”\n“Yeah…” Wayne said, his eyes closed. “He realized they were looking\nto make a bomb, and heard about splitting harmonium. And he was maybe\nalready a little eccentric. He tried to save the city … But he was an odd\nfellow, and nobody listened…”\nEyes closed, he spread his arms out and turned around slowly, smelling\nthe place—and imagining it. Stacked old dishes in the corner. He could still\nsmell them. Frantic nights … reading … thinking …\n“They didn’t listen,” Wayne said. “And when they locked him up, he\nlearned he couldn’t use the normal justice system to stop the disaster.”\n“So what did he do?” Kim asked. “You think the people who killed him\nwere scared that they missed something. That implies he knew something\nthey didn’t want leaked. Where did he stash it?”\n“He didn’t,” Wayne whispered. “That’s not what this fellow would do.\nYou see, the Set … they’re going to be wrong about him. Just like Kim is.”\n“How?” Marasi asked softly from somewhere to his right.\n“The Set,” Wayne said, “they hold on to knowledge. They strangle it,\nMarasi. But a fellow like this, he might be a little unhinged, but he wants\npeople to know what he knows. He ain’t going to lock his ideas up in some\ntrain station. He’ll share them. If the government won’t listen, then…”\nHe opened his eyes and met Wax’s. “… he’ll do whatever he can to get\nthe information out.”\n“Kim,” Wax said, thoughtful, “which local broadsheet has the worst\nreputation?

Particularly if it’s frightening, or a little off-kilter?”\n“There are at least seven of those,” she replied.\n“Which one syndicates the writings of that fool Jak?”\n“The Sentinel of Truth,” she said. “I … kind of love those…” She\nseemed embarrassed, but she needn’t be. Those were good stories. Super\ndumb, of course, but sometimes you needed cheap storytelling with your\ncheap booze. Didn’t make no sense to read literature while drinking outta a\npaper sack.\n“Sentinel of Truth…” Wax said. “Do you know the address of their\noffices?”\n“I can look it up,” Kim said, digging out one of her volumes of city\naddresses.\nWayne took off the hat and held it lightly. The poor fellow, Tobal\nCopper, was dead. He hadn’t let the Set push him around or force him to\nwork for them. They’d come here to learn what he knew about them and\ntheir plans, and they hadn’t left him alive. But maybe he’d told someone.\nSomeone the Set hadn’t been able to find—because letting go of\ninformation, to them, would be inconceivable.\n“I’ve got it,” Kim said. “Publishing offices of the Sentinel can be found\nat…” She looked up. “Seventh Street. Office 42–13. Nights! The same\nnumbers you found on the bottom of the envelope.”\nWax squeezed him on the arm. “Nice work, Wayne.”\nHe shrugged. “It’s easy enough when you have a lot to work with.”\n“That was a lot?” Kim asked, curious.\n“Sure,” Wayne said, tucking the hat away. “A man’s whole life.”\n31\nSteris took a long, deep breath. It was the sort of thing she’d read about for\ncalming nerves. She’d seen Marasi do it during stressful situations. Did it\nwork? Steris wasn’t certain. But the act was very normal, wasn’t it?\nShe took another deep breath in case she’d done it wrong, letting it out\nslowly. Then she stepped into the Senate’s main assembly hall to be\nassaulted by noise and chaos. The two were so often partners.\nSenators shouted across the chamber at each other. Aides fluttered about,\ndelivering afternoon broadsheets and private reports to their senators. She’d\nbeen able to acquire a few of these—not actual broadsheets from Bilming,\nbut local reprints or summaries received via telegraph. Emergency editions\nwere common with big stories, each paper rushing to capitalize.\nThey wouldn’t be the most accurate stories. But they could certainly\nstart fires. She glanced at a few as she walked past.\nCONSTABLES DEAD!

That wasn’t a nuance for headlines. Still, she had\nsent her children out of the city with Kath. She prayed to the Survivor that\nthey were safe in their grandfather’s estate to the south.\nFor now, Steris pushed through the cacophony, steeling herself against\nthe fluttering of pages, the tumult of words, and made her way to the vice\ngovernor’s seat. There Steris delivered the proper authorization form for her\nto take her husband’s position in the Senate.\nAdawathwyn said nothing about the dire letter Steris had sent earlier,\ndetailing the threat to the city. Why? Did they dismiss her that easily?\nPeople never wanted to listen to Steris. They preferred to nod along and\nthink about other things. She made her way to Wax’s seat—her seat. Wax\nwas correct; standing for House Ladrian was her right. Indeed, it was one of\nthe main reasons they’d initially explored a union. Her fortune; his\nauthority. Together they could do great things.\nIf she could keep her nerve. Yes, she’d taken his spot before, but never\nfor something so vital. So, she stood at the small desk, surrounded by chaos.\nShe’d prepared for this. She’d written down what it would be like. She’d\neven taken two deep breaths. Yes, her heart thundered in her chest, insisting\nshe was nervous, but what did her heart know? It had spent years insisting\nshe’d never fall in love, and it had been so very wrong. Her heart was no\nexpert in what she couldn’t do. It only knew what she had and hadn’t done.\nAs she’d hoped, people noticed her there, standing silently, and some of\nthe arguments dropped off. This allowed Adawathwyn to shout for quiet in\nthe room—and finally be heard. Her forceful tone, unusual for a\nTerriswoman, brought order at last. Like a teakettle moved from the burner,\nsenators stopped boiling, but remained hot—settling in their seats and\nmuttering softly.\n“The governor,” Adawathwyn said, “requests an explanation from the\nacting senator of House Ladrian.”\nEvery eye in the room turned to Steris. Well, she was accustomed to\nthat. People did tend to stare at her. Or glare. Or glower. It depended on\nhow wrong they were, and what level of annoyed they were at hearing her\npoint it out.\n“My husband,” she said to the room, “has been called back to his duties\nas a lawman because of a particularly dangerous situation in Bilming. His\noperation was fully approved by the constables-general, under the authority\nof the governor himself. Your Grace, everything my husband has done has\nbeen strictly legal and documented.”\n“Sometimes,” the governor said, “it doesn’t matter if the permissions are\nin place and the documents prepared. An act can still be improper.”\nWhat? How dare he! That was the very definition of proper! Steris\nforced down her anger. Some people … just thought that way.\nShe covertly glanced at her note card.

She had determined, after\ndeliberating all morning, that she’d need to get the governor into a small-\ngroup setting. She didn’t want to panic the city, and didn’t yet know how\nurgent the timing was.\nShe still needed to get a plan in place for evacuating the city. Always\nplan for the worst. So: get the governor into a more private conversation. In\nthe proper circumstances, he could authorize an evacuation of the city\nwithout a Senate vote.\n“Your Grace,” she said to the governor, “Constable-General Reddi has\ninformation of relevance about my husband’s mission. I sent him reports\nwith details of my fears this morning. We are facing a far larger issue, even,\nthan the growing intercity aggression. I therefore move that a select council\nbe formed to deal with the emergency in an immediate and timely manner.”\nA Governor’s Select Council would be a small commission—in this\ncase made up of a handful of senators and at least one constable-general—\nwith a limited remit. In the past, they had been used for smaller-scale\nmatters, such as addressing traffic needs in the city hub. But a select council\nwas a potent tool, allowing a concentration of power in a few specific\nindividuals. She was shocked it hadn’t been used for an emergency before\nnow; a thorough reading of the law made the application obvious.\n“Wait,” the governor asked, “is that … allowed? I thought those\ncommittees were for choosing flowers at grand openings and the like.”\nThe vice governor grabbed him by the arm and pulled him down, where\nthey conversed in quiet, hissing tones—eventually calling over a legal\nclerk. Several others in the room did likewise.\nThe governor stood up. “This seems an excellent suggestion,” he said,\nsounding surprised. “Motion to vote on creating a select council on this\nmatter with Bilming?” He pointedly looked toward a few senators in the\nroom—including Lord Darlin Cett, a man with slicked-back, thinning hair.\nThe Cetts were among the more powerful faction leaders in this\nincarnation of the government, and the look seemed to say, “You’ll be\nincluded in this council if you vote for it.” It was a shrewd move for the\ngovernor, which likely meant he hadn’t come up with it himself.\nFor once, the Senate vote gave Steris the result she’d been hoping for. A\nselect council was to be formed at the governor’s discretion, granted\nauthority for twenty-four hours to deal with the crisis at Bilming.\n“Lord Cett,” the governor said, “Lady Hammondess, and Lady Gardre.\nPlease join me and Adawathwyn in the governor’s chambers to strategize\nuntil Constable-General Reddi arrives. The rest of the Senate is adjourned.”\nSteris hesitated. He hadn’t called on her. Was … that an oversight? Was\nit implied that she’d join him, or …\nOr was he leaving her out?\nOh, rusts. How could she have missed such a natural possibility? She\ncalled for a select council, but then wasn’t included in it? She should have\nseen that coming.\nShe put her hand to her head, feeling hot and ashamed of herself. The\nwoman who was ready for everything, blindsided by such an obvious move."

The\nwoman who was ready for everything, blindsided by such an obvious move.\nAs she tried to control her nausea, someone stood up at the back of the\nchamber—from the observation seats. A figure in a sharp wooden mask\npainted with red lines. “Your Grace,” the Malwish ambassador said, “I\nshould very much like to observe the workings of this council.”\n“Um, Admiral Daal?” the governor said. “This is a matter of internal\nBasin affairs.”\n“Yes, which is exactly why I want to observe,” the ambassador said. “I\ncan learn much about a people by how they react to a crisis. I have a\npleasure craft, of a personal ownership, docked in the city. Perhaps you\nwould find it useful to borrow, my lord governor? To observe the Basin.”\nThe governor blinked. “Well,” he said, “I’m sure the wisdom of a battle-\nhardened admiral would be of great use to our council. Come on, then.”\nOh, rusts. Had he really taken such an obvious bribe? In public? The\naction cut through Steris’s shame, and she glanced toward Adawathwyn.\nThe vice governor had her palm to her face. She’d have to work hard to\nspin that exchange. But, well, one of the problems with having a pushover\nlike Varlance as governor was that others were fully capable of pushing too.\nYou can push, Steris thought at herself. You have to try.\nIgnoring her instincts—which wanted her to sit down and write out how\nshe could have foreseen this situation—Steris hopped out of her seat and\nran to the floor, shoving unceremoniously between a pair of senators to\nreach the governor.\n“Your Grace,” she said. “I believe I can offer relevant insight to this\ncouncil.”\n“Oh!” he said, glancing toward her. “Lady Ladrian?” He then looked to\nthe side, where Adawathwyn shook her head sharply. “Alas,” the governor\nsaid, turning back to Steris, “I feel the council is already crowded. It was\nwonderful of you to make the suggestion though.”\n“Your Grace,” she said. “There is a dire threat to the city. You need to\nhear me out.”\nThe governor hesitated.\n“She sent a letter about this earlier in the morning, Your Honor,”\nAdawathwyn said. “Some nonsense about a bomb capable of destroying\nElendel.”\n“What is this?” he said, turning toward his vice governor.\n“It’s true,” Steris said. “You didn’t even give it to him?”\n“Your house has a history of inflating problems,” Adawathwyn said.\n“Remember the time your husband claimed that voting against his workers’\nrights act would cause an uproar in the city? Or when he insisted the\nRoughs would form its own country if we continued our tariff plans?”\n“This time it’s different,” Steris said. “He … has confirmation from\nHarmony.”\n“I see,” Adawathwyn said. “And if Harmony himself were going to\nspeak to someone, would he not speak to the governor?”\n“Has your husband seen a bomb?” the governor asked. “Does he have\nproof to back up your claims?”\n“He’s gathering evidence now,” Steris said."

This is not a place for a woman who has been a sitting\nsenator for less than an hour.” He smiled. “Indeed, this situation is going to\nrequire delicacy and tact, not…”\nNot whatever it is you are, the unfinished sentence seemed to imply. He\nnodded to her, then joined the others at the door to the governor’s chambers.\nSteris was left alone in the center of the floor. Humiliated. She … well,\nshe’d have to make another plan. Yes, plan how to deal with this situation.\nShe could take the rest of the day …\nNo. She couldn’t afford to spend time planning. She had to get into that\nroom.\nAnd in the moment, she thought of one way she might be able to\naccomplish it.\n32\nThe Sentinel of Truth broadsheet offices didn’t fit Bilming. Unlike the sleek,\nmodern designs, its building looked like a shack. An older wooden\nstructure, only one story, with a peaked roof, bulging walls, and small\nwindows.\n“One of the old buildings,” Kim explained, “from when this section of\ntown held a lot of fishing shacks. The push to start knocking everything\ndown and build anew came five years ago, but there are structures like this\nsprinkled throughout the city.”\n“Doesn’t seem like it’s been in operation lately,” Wax said, noting the\npadlock on the door, the dark interior. “Is it still publishing?”\n“Releases have been sporadic lately,” Kim said. “I had to wait six weeks\nto read the end of the ‘Survivor’s Last Testament’ arc of Jak’s explorations.”\nRusting idiot man, Wax thought. Ever since the discovery of the\n“Sovereign” who had ruled and helped the people of the Southern lands,\nSurvivor fervor had been at a high point. Sightings all over the city,\nparticularly on misty nights.\nJak, of course, had capitalized on this and had spent years “discovering”\nSurvivor artifacts in his adventures. It wouldn’t be half as bad if the fool\ndidn’t mention Wax now and then.\nThey knocked at a side door, and when they got no reply they tried the\ndoor and found it locked. So Wax wrapped a coat tassel around his fist and\nprepared to smash in the window.\n“Wax?” Marasi said. “What are you doing?”\n“Beginning an investigation.”\n“Let’s wait a few minutes,” she said. “See if the owner returns.”\nHe stopped, his fist a few inches from the glass. “We have a writ of\ninvestigation. We can break in.”\n“If it’s an emergency,” she said. “And if we’ve tried other options. This\nis a private citizen’s property, and we have no reason to believe the Set is\nhere. And unlike the apartment earlier, we have no reason to believe a crime\nhas been committed.”"

They’ll let you off.”\n“It’s not about what we can get away with, Wayne,” Marasi said, putting\nher hand to her face. “It’s about proper procedure. You can’t just smash into\nany place you want to—the world is changing. People have rights. It makes\nour job harder, but it makes the world better.”\nWax frowned, lowering his hand.\n“We can afford to wait a few minutes,” Marasi said. “If we’re right, we\nwant whoever owns this place to work with us—and breaking in might turn\nthem against us. If we’re wrong, then we’ll have ransacked someone’s place\nof business for nothing.” She glanced at the sun. “It’s lunchtime. The owner\nmight be out—they are still putting out papers, after all, so we have reason\nto think they’ll show up for work eventually.”\nWax reluctantly backed down. He expected Wayne to complain, but the\nshorter man just shrugged and jogged over to a street corner food stand to\nget something to eat. Marasi and Kim settled down on a bench beside a\nsmall nearby park, leaving Wax to put his back to a well-groomed tree set\ninto a little piece of earth with a low fence around it.\nMoments like this made him feel old. Not just of body, but of mind. He\nseemed to represent something that was dying. The lone lawman. And …\nwell, it was hard to mourn. Because intellectually, he agreed with Marasi.\nHe’d voted for legal restrictions on constable authority. Society needed\nrobust checks on everyone’s power. Even his. Especially his.\nBut at the same time, that made the world seem too big to fix. Out in the\nRoughs he could beat in a door and talk—or sometimes shoot—sense into\nanyone who needed it. It had made him feel like he could solve basically\nany problem.\nBut that had been a false impression of control, hadn’t it?\nAcknowledging that made him uncomfortable. It wasn’t that the world was\ngrowing more complicated. It was that he was letting himself see it had\nalways been complicated.\nA minute later, Wax heard something. He swore it came from the\nbuilding. He narrowed his eyes, burning steel, tracking the blue lines\naround him to a few moving near the top of the building. An attic? He\nraised a hand to the others, then slipped out Vindication. Someone was up\nthere. He was certain of it. Had they simply not heard the calls earlier?\nHe dropped a bullet casing and launched off it, then landed carefully on\nthe roof near where the shingles sloped past a small attic window, shuttered\nclosed. Quiet though he’d tried to be, the metal lines moved sharply right as\nhe landed—then they stilled. Mostly. They were quivering.\nHe narrowed his eyes at the window.

Shingles rattled under his feet as he\nengaged his steel bubble—the subtle Push he’d learned to use to deflect\nbullets. It made the nails in the rooftop vibrate as they tried to escape the\nfield.\nVibrating, he thought, like that line ahead of me. That’s a gun in the\nhands of someone who is trembling.\nHe wasn’t facing a Set assassin. Carefully, he raised his gun to the side,\npointed away from the window.\n“I’m a constable,” he said loudly. “I’m here to help.”\nSilence. Then finally a voice. Feminine, husky. “You’re here to kill me.\nLike you killed Tobal.”\n“No,” Wax said. “I promise it.” He stepped forward. “I’m looking for\nthe people who killed him. If I were here for another reason, I’d have shot\ninstead of spoken.”\nMore silence. Long enough to unnerve him, until finally the shutters\nswung open, revealing a short woman. She had frizzy grey-black hair and a\ndisheveled appearance—a waistcoat buttoned with a few holes skipped, a\nlong skirt that was rumpled as if it spent most of its life in a heap in a\ncorner. She had dark bags under her eyes and a wan appearance, as if she’d\nbeen heavier once but had lost weight, like a couch missing some of its\nstuffing.\n“You…” she said, lowering a rifle. “Are you … Dawnshot?”\n“That’s me,” he said, relaxing.\nShe brightened. “You’re Jak’s friend!”\nJak’s friend? Just because that idiot brought up Wax’s name once in a\nwhile? He opened his mouth to object, but thought better of it.\n“I … know of him,” Wax said. “Look, something is happening in this\ncity. Something very dangerous. I followed the trail to Tobal’s apartment,\nthen here. Please. Did he give you something? Tell you something?”\nShe leaned out, suspiciously scanning the streets. “Meet me below, at\nthe back.” She pulled the shutters closed, and he joined Marasi and Kim at\nthe back doors as they rattled, numerous locks and chains being undone.\nFinally, she pulled the door open. “I don’t normally talk to conners.\nEver.”\n“’S good advice,” Wayne mumbled through a mouthful of something.\nHe walked up beside Wax and took another bite of what appeared to be\ngrease and maybe some bits of meat wrapped in what might have been\nbread. Or a very large crepe?\n“But since you’re friends of Jak…” she said.\n“Sure are,” Wayne said, slapping Wax on the shoulder. “Jak and Wax\nhere adventured together out in the Roughs!”\n“I guess, then,” she said, gesturing for them to enter, “you’re not that\nkind of constable. You’re the other kind.”\n“Yup,” Wayne said. “We’re the kind what don’t like uniforms and shoots\npeople when they try to make us sign paperwork.” He took another bite of\nhis wrap.\n“What even is that?” Wax asked as Marasi and Kim entered."

With street food, that’s how you know it’s good.”\nThe building inside was musty and dark, and had numerous trash bins\nby the door—as if the woman hadn’t dared leave to empty them. She\nwatched Wax, rifle in hand—though not raised—as if certain he’d turn on\nher at any moment.\n“Is … Jak in the city?” she asked. “Available to help?”\n“I … um…” Wax said. “No. He’s on … an adventure.”\n“Don’t suppose you can send for him?” she sounded hopeful.\n“Afraid not.”\nShe frowned, eyeing him.\n“Oh, don’t mind Dawnshot,” Wayne said, nudging Wax. “He gets coy\nabout Jak sometimes.” He leaned toward the woman. “Honestly, he’s a little\njealous.”\n“Well, who wouldn’t be?” she said, then sighed and began doing up the\nlocks on the door. “Has he ever let you hold the Spear of the Red Sun?”\nWayne looked at Wax, who gritted his teeth. “No,” he forced himself to\nsay. “It’s too powerful. Jak says I might accidentally awaken some …\nzombies if I’m allowed to touch it.”\nThe woman nodded, locks secured, then waved for them to follow her\ninto the building.\n“Good,” Wayne whispered to Wax. “But the spear wasn’t used for\nzombies. They was on the Island of Death, with Nicki.”\n“How do you know?” Wax hissed to him.\n“I read every one,” Wayne said. “Why wouldn’t I?”\n“You…”\n“I thought you couldn’t read,” Marasi said, brushing past them and\nfollowing the woman.\n“Oh, I can read,” Wayne said. “But I’m dumb, see, so I can only read\nthings what are dumb too.”\nThe woman led them through a corridor crowded with books—stacks of\nthem, taking up almost every available space. In the next room were a large\nprinting press, some buckets of ink, and boxes of lead type scattered about.\nHer picture on the wall, hanging askew and showing her in younger years,\nwas captioned MARAGA DULCET, EDITOR-IN-CHIEF.\n“So,” she said, running a hand through her disheveled hair, “you know\nwho killed Tobal? Was it those people with the golden hair living on the\neast side? They’re some kind of fairy creature; I know it.”\n“Actually,” Marasi said, “we think it was a secretive group plotting to\nstart up the Ashmounts again—and we worry they’re working to create\nbombs of incredible power.”\nMaraga nodded. “So you do know.”\nThat was a test, Wax realized.\nMaraga opened a doorway that revealed a set of old steps. “Well then.\nFollow me.”\nShe led the way down and Wax followed, waving for Marasi and Kim to\nstay back a few feet. The air smelled of old potatoes, spiders, and forgotten\njars of something that might have once been preserves.

Maraga flipped a\nswitch at the bottom, powering a set of electric lights swinging on wires.\nCovering the walls of the musty basement room were sheets of metal,\nscratched in detail—filled with words and diagrams, letters and pictures all\ncramped up together.\n“Figured we’d write it all in metal,” Maraga said. “Just in case.”\n33\nEyes wide with wonder, Marasi walked around the basement. It seemed to\nhave once been used for storage, judging by the piles of old equipment and\nstacked throw mats. This had all been pushed away from the walls to make\nroom for the metal sheets.\nThe Words of Founding mentioned metal plates, and Marasi had\nimagined large, thick sheets with the words chiseled in bold, powerful\nletters. Instead, Maraga had scratched sheets of tin with a pen, often\nscribbling out sentences and lines she got wrong. A lot of it was organized\nas lists. It had a frenzied air to it, but not like—say—the ravings of a\nmadman. More like …\nNotes, Marasi thought. A journalist’s shorthand notes, connecting ideas\nand building a story.\nMaraga slumped down on the bottom step, seeming exhausted. “I …\ndidn’t believe him at first,” she whispered. “Tobal. Thought he was another\ncrackpot. But they usually have a good story to tell, something my readers\nwant to hear.\n“Then he started to bring me evidence. Information he stole from his\nemployers. I think he was sneaking back in, grabbing ledgers, scraps,\nwhatever he could find … Never would let me help. He didn’t want me to\nget too involved.” She looked up at the walls. “As if this weren’t already\nenough to get me killed…”\nMarasi walked closer to offer comfort, but the woman flinched. There\nwas a … fatalistic air about her. The air of a woman who had thrown the\ndice and was waiting to see how the numbers came up.\n“How long?” Wax asked, inspecting one of the plates.\n“Almost four years,” Maraga whispered. “Like I said, I didn’t believe\nhim at first. But I’ve always been interested in the stories that slip through\nthe cracks. The ones other papers ignore because they seem too sensational,\nor too lowbrow.”\n“Lies, you mean,” Wax said. “You print lies.”\n“We prefer ‘whimsical what-ifs.’ Intriguing stories that would be\nfascinating if they were true.”\n“So…” Wax said, “lies.”\n“Our patrons understand what they’re buying, Lord Ladrian,” Maraga\nsaid, lifting her chin. “You know. You’re friends with Jak himself. It’s all\nabout being larger than life, bigger than reality! Our patrons know we\nstretch to find the more interesting tidbits, the ‘might’s and the ‘could-be’s\nof the world.”\nHe shook his head, obviously unconvinced.\nMaraga sniffed. “I did my journeymanship at the Times, top paper in the\ncity.

I print human-interest stories—the tales of people who are\nignored by the larger media. Exciting stories, by adventuring celebrities.\nCartoons, pictures of funny-shaped vegetables…”\n“How funny?” Wayne said from across the room.\n“Depends on your sense of humor,” Maraga replied.\n“Crass. With a light seasoning of vulgarity.”\n“Second box on the left,” she said. “Next to your foot.”\nWayne located the appropriate box, which was filled with sketches. In\nseconds he was snickering to himself.\n“Anyway,” Maraga continued, “the more Tobal brought, and the more I\npieced together, the more terrified I became. This … was a story. A real\nstory. Not a whimsical tale about bug men or the dangers of electricity.\nThis … this could get people killed. Could get me killed.”\nShe looked up at them, then continued. “Once I believed, we worked for\nmany months, putting all of this together. I started to see things he didn’t.\nTobal wasn’t … completely credible. He jumped to conclusions. But he\nwasn’t wrong, not at the heart of the story. And he hadn’t made it up.\n“He told me that one day he wouldn’t show up to our nightly\nconversation. He said, when that happened, I should run. Take everything to\nthe authorities. But the authorities are involved, so … what then? Who to\ntell? And then, two weeks ago, he didn’t show up. One night. Two. Three …\nAnd I knew. I knew. They’d found him.”\n“I’m sorry,” Marasi said.\n“Could he still be alive?” Maraga asked. “Might they have just … taken\nhim?”\n“It’s possible,” Marasi said. “But … we don’t think it’s likely.”\nMaraga nodded, looking down at her feet. Then she closed her eyes and\nseemed to be waiting. For what?\nFor the dice to land, Marasi realized. She doesn’t trust us. She’s waiting\nto see if we shoot.\nMarasi looked around the room and noticed that Wayne—despite\npretending to look at the pictures—was actually watching Moonlight, one\nhand resting lazily on his dueling cane. Likely with his metals ready, just in\ncase she tried something. Even Wax was watching her from the corner of\nhis eye.\n“This is brilliant,” Moonlight said instead, staring at one of the walls.\n“Are these … trajectory estimations?”\nMarasi joined her beside one set of sketches in tin, which depicted\nlooping arcs. Moonlight was right; it looked like measurements with\ndifferent estimates of how far a shot could reach.\nMaraga stood up, seeming to take strength from the question. “That’s\nright,” she said. “Those numbers are the distances the Bilming military\nclaim their new guns can fire. They love to send releases to the local\nbroadsheets, extolling their grand navy. It’s mostly bravado. They imply\nthey could shell Elendel from twenty miles away, but that’s a lie. The guns\nare much shorter range than that.”\n“And this?” Marasi asked, pointing at another set of trajectories."

The guns\nare much shorter range than that.”\n“And this?” Marasi asked, pointing at another set of trajectories.\n“Poor Tobal’s job was to research chemical propellants,” Maraga\nreplied. At their confused stares, she continued. “These people, they’re\ntrying to develop self-propelled shells. Weapons that could fire themselves\nand fly miles. Or even hundreds of miles. Before hitting and detonating.”\nRusts, Marasi thought, her eyes widening. She walked through the room,\ntaking in each of the eight large plates on the walls. She identified one\nhaving to do with the “subway” systems of the city, a large interconnected\ncavern complex that was being “surveyed” to determine where to place\ntrain lines. But the truth, according to Maraga’s notes, was entirely different\n—the surveys were seeking caverns that could offer stable underground\nliving conditions.\nThey’re preparing bunkers, Marasi thought. That’s what the supplies are\nfor—they’re stocking up for a cataclysm, perhaps?\nJust as people had sought refuge in caverns during the last days before\nthe world ended. Before Harmony’s Ascension and the remaking of the\nland.\n“This doesn’t make sense,” Wax said, joining her. “Harmony says my\nsister is trying to prove she can rule this planet. If she blows it up, what\ndoes that prove? Why build bunkers? Does she honestly think that saving a\nfragment of us and annihilating the rest would prove her competence?”\n“I don’t know,” Marasi admitted, then pointed at another plate. “This\ntalks about ashfalls. The days of ash and destruction allowed the Lord Ruler\nto secure near-universal power, at least in the North. So maybe Telsin thinks\nthat would work again?”\n“You should read the next plate over,” Maraga said.\nTogether they stepped to the side, reading what appeared to be a list of\nnames. “Dupon Melstrom…” Wax read. “Vennis Hasting … Mari\nHammondess … These are some of the most powerful senators in Elendel.”\n“They’re in on it,” Maraga said.\n“What?” Marasi said, spinning. “All of them?”\nMaraga dug in a cabinet and came out with a piece of paper. She handed\nit to Marasi, who showed it to Wax. A letter from Vennis Hasting, talking\nabout the creation of a bomb of incredible power. It was dated almost a year\nago, and implicated many of the names on the wall.\nMarasi frowned. That … that seemed impossible. This many people in\ntheir own government knew? Could the Set have its fingers wrapped that\ntightly around the Basin? She looked at Wax.\n“I know some of these people,” he said. “Vennis is a rat, of course—but\nLady Yomen is a good friend. As close a senator as I trust. This doesn’t add\nup, Marasi. None of this adds up.”\n“Maybe that’s why the Senate is so confident,” she said, “that they can\nbully the Outer Cities.”\n“I know these people,” Wax said. “They wouldn’t keep a secret like this;\nthey couldn’t.

He took the letter, staring at it, and she knew\nwhat he was thinking: if the Set’s tendrils ran this deep—even into the\nhearts of his friends among the senators …\n“No,” he said. “There’s something very strange here, Marasi. If my\nsister had all of these people following her dictates, she would already rule\nthe Basin. We’re missing a big piece of this.”\nMoonlight walked up to them, nodding toward another of the plates.\n“You’re talking about a bomb? Well, it seems they have one—look at this.”\nMarasi and Wax walked over, finding another plate with a list of\nunderground disturbances. It was labeled with the words “Underground\nweapon tests, tracked using seismograph.”\n“They’ve developed an underground base beneath the city,” Maraga\nsaid. “It’s where they hide. Lord Mayor Entrone is involved, is probably\neven one of their leaders. Some of the caverns seem to be weapons testing\nlocations, but others are bunkers they’re preparing for some reason and\nusing as a headquarters.”\n“They stopped the tests recently,” Moonlight said. “Wonder why?”\n“Well…” Maraga said. “They know it works. I mean, they’re well past\ntheir go date.”\n“Go date?” Marasi asked, feeling cold.\n“Stolen internal memos,” Maraga said, pointing to a plate. “Don’t know\nhow he got them. Listing target dates for project completion. The weapon\nwas supposed to be detonated two weeks ago.” Maraga slumped back down\nonto the steps. “They killed him the day before that. I thought for sure the\nend would come soon after …\n“I…” She buried her head in her hands. “I know I should have published\nthis. I’m a coward. In the end, I’m a coward. I’ve been hunkered up here,\nwaiting for the ash to fall, haven’t I? Rusts. I was convinced no one would\nlisten … Convinced it was too late…”\n“What is done, or not done, is past,” Wax said, firm. “We have the\ninformation now. And there’s still time to stop this.”\n“Wax,” Marasi hissed, taking his arm. “They have a bomb, and are\nplanning—as far as we can determine—to detonate it in Elendel. They\nwould have done it already, if they could figure out how to get it into the\ncity.”\nMaraga nodded. “Their self-propelled weapon—the rocket, they call it\n—is having difficulties. Fuel might be the problem. It’s what Tobal was\nworking on for them before he realized what they were planning…” She\nstood up and steeled herself. “I need to show you one more thing.” She\nhurried to some boxes and dug through them as Moonlight unabashedly\ntook rubbings of the plates.\nMaraga dug out an evanotype photo. “The crowning jewel,” she said"

The above-the-fold photo for the story\nI’ll never actually write…”\nMarasi took it, frowning at Wax, who joined her. It depicted an ashen\nlandscape. In color.\nMarasi gasped softly, looking at the stark orange sky, the floating ash,\nthe remnants of a ruined city in the distance. That looked … kind of like\nElendel, though the ash was heaped so high, obscuring all but the tops of\nthe smoldering, broken buildings and jagged destroyed walls.\n“How…” Marasi said. “How can you have a picture of the end of the\nworld?”\n“They didn’t have evanotypes in the Survivor’s day,” Wax said, looking\nclosely. “The colors are remarkable. Did someone take an old photo and\npaint onto it?”\n“I don’t know,” Maraga said. “But it seems like a picture of … of what\nis going to happen. After he found this, Tobal started to get really scared.\nHe barely stayed during our last visits. I think he mostly just huddled in his\nrooms until they got him. Like … like I’ve been doing.”\nThe basement fell silent, even Wayne sensing the mood and covering up\nany snickering at his funny pictures. Marasi felt a mounting horror at the\nsight of that picture. She’d heard Wax talk about a bomb, knew what the\nenemy was trying to build. Laying it out in stark depiction, however,\nchanged it from abstract to concrete.\nThis was what they wanted to do. Wipe out everything she loved. Leave\nrubble and ash in its place. These were bigger stakes by far than any\ninvestigation she’d ever done. And the implications of it left her disquieted\non a profound level.\nShe turned around, looking at the plates reflecting the calm electric light.\nSomething ancient. Something new. Just like the picture Wax handed back\nto her.\nA door opened upstairs.\nThe locks had been fastened, but that didn’t stop whoever had arrived.\nWayne scrambled to his feet, hands going to his dueling canes as a single\nset of footsteps crossed the wooden floor up above.\nWax slid a gun from its holster and positioned himself to watch the\nsteps. A figure descended onto the stairs. A woman with dark hair and a\nrugged build that seemed in conflict with her small nose and prim lips. She\nwore a suit: slacks, buttoned white shirt, jacket and cravat.\nTelsin. Wax’s sister, leader of the Set. She wasn’t armed, at least not in a\nway that Marasi could make out. And she didn’t seem to mind that Wax had\na gun pointed at her head while Wayne backed away, muttering.\n“An address,” Telsin said. “The number on the back of the envelope was\na rusting address? Do you know how many hours we wasted tearing into\nlockers at train stations?”\n34\nMarasi immediately reached for an Allomantic grenade, charging one\nsilently in her pocket.

Wayne had\nscrambled back from the steps and was muttering to himself, hopping from\none foot to the other. He looked around as if he expected enemies to come\nbursting in through the walls.\nLast time they’d seen Telsin, she had betrayed them to the Set. She’d\nnearly gotten Wax killed, and in return Wayne had fired a shotgun blast at\nher chest. The first time he’d fired a gun in … well, Marasi didn’t know\nhow long.\nTelsin had healed, however, vanishing from the bloodied snows where\nWayne had left her. She was a Hemalurgist, with at least the power of a\nBloodmaker—like Wayne. She had shown hints of two other powers, but it\nwas possible the members of the Set switched out their spikes to gain\ndifferent Metallic Arts. Regardless, she apparently had enough abilities now\nthat she didn’t seem the least bit concerned about facing them alone. Rusts.\n“This is marvelous,” Telsin said, glancing around the basement.\n“Remarkable how many of our secrets he managed to sneak out,\nconsidering. Who would have thought our greatest danger wasn’t armies,\nconstables, or even you, Waxillium? It was a miserable, bald old chemist.”\n“Tobal was a good man!” Maraga said, and ducked behind Wax as\nTelsin looked toward her.\n“Oh, you can lower the gun, Waxillium,” Telsin said, settling down on\nthe steps. “The idiot over there will tell you how effective shooting me\nwas.”\n“Felt good,” Wayne said. “Does it need to do more than that? Here,\nWax. Hand me a gun. I’ll have at it a few more times.”\nWax didn’t move, and Telsin rolled her eyes. They all stood there,\nMarasi’s grenade vibrating softly in her fingers as it absorbed her power.\nWhat now? They were being played, obviously. But how? Would the Set’s\nleader come to see them as a simple distraction?\n“Tell us what the Set is planning,” Marasi said.\n“No,” Telsin replied.\n“Oh,” Wayne said, perking up. “Does this mean I can make her talk? On\na scale of one to broken, how much do you fancy your kneecaps, Telsin?”\n“I’ll heal in seconds, Wayne,” Telsin said.\n“Not if we yank out the spikes,” Wayne snapped.\n“Which would kill me,” Telsin said. “I’m sure that will give you so\nmuch information.”\n“Well,” Wayne said, “breaking some pieces off you will still hurt,\nTelsin. I know a thing or two about that part.”\n“Actually,” she said, “it won’t hurt. Did you know that a Feruchemist\ncan store their pain in a metalmind? Oh, and you won’t be able to remove\nmine from me. We’ve learned better how to hide those. So torture me if you\nwant, Wayne. I’ll find it boring, but nothing more.”\nShe met his gaze with confidence. Wayne glanced toward Marasi,\nconcerned, shying away. Like a puppy whose chew toy had bitten it back."

Like a puppy whose chew toy had bitten it back.\nMarasi was more worried about Wax. He’d frozen in place, gun out and\npointed at Telsin, arm straight. Expression … grim. Telsin was his last close\nliving relative, and she’d played him for a fool. Six years ago, he’d\ndedicated a great deal of emotional and physical effort to rescuing her from\nthe evil forces he’d thought had taken her. Only to find she’d been working\nwith them all along.\nNow, she’d thrown her lot in with a god planning to destroy the world.\n“Why are you here, Telsin?” Wax asked.\n“To warn you, Waxillium,” Telsin said from across the room. “Your next\nactions will be of the utmost importance. You have two days to solve this\nproblem. Only two precious days.”\nWax cursed softly, leaning down beside Marasi and Wayne. “Speed\nbubble,” he hissed.\nWayne threw one up and slowed the world around them. It would also\nprevent Telsin from hearing, or at least understanding, what they were\nsaying.\n“What’s she playin’ at, Wax?” Wayne said. “She should look more\nthreatened. I shot her. Me. First time in years. And she don’t even look like\nshe cared.”\n“Wayne,” Marasi said, “it’s not like you gave her your virginity.”\n“No it’s not!” he said. “I give that away all the time. This was special.”\nMarasi glanced at Wax. “You all right?”\n“I will be,” he said softly, staring at his sister—frozen in time. “It’s …\npainful. Like an old injury aching again. Because it never healed right.”\n“Why did she say two days?” Marasi asked. “Wax, she’s trying to\nwrong-foot us.”\n“I agree,” he said. “She’s trying to get us to believe we have more time\nthan we do. One of her games.” He narrowed his eyes. “Her being here says\nsomething she may not realize, though. That she’s desperate. She knows she\nhas to stop us.”\n“But she’s not afraid of us,” Marasi said.\n“Not physically,” Wax said. “She’s not afraid of being captured or killed\nby us. Harmony said … well, she’s—at least in a small way—part god.\nAutonomy has Invested her with some sort of power and authority, made\nher the avatar of Trell on this planet. For now. Until she fails.”\n“Wait,” Wayne said. “Who is Trell and who is Autonomy and who is that\non the steps?”\n“That on the steps,” Wax said, “is my sister. A woman representing the\ngod Autonomy. Using the title of Trell—an ancient god from this world.”\n“Right…” Wayne said. “And all three are utter knobs?”\n“Utter knobs,” Wax agreed.\nMarasi followed their gaze back toward Telsin, looking so proud and\nconfident. As she watched, Marasi could swear that Telsin’s eyes began to\nglow a soft red. The faintest of light. It was gone a moment later."

It was gone a moment later.\n“Rusts,” she whispered. “This feels like it’s way above our pay scale,\nWax.”\n“There’s no one else,” he said. “But like I said, if she’s here, she’s\nworried about us. She wanted to go through with her plan weeks ago, but is\nhaving problems getting her technology to work. Now here we are, sniffing\nabout, finding things they couldn’t track down. My gut says she’s here\nbecause she wants an opportunity to mess with my mind. Nudge me the\nwrong direction. Risky of her, but smart.”\nThey all fell silent, but Marasi had that same sense of cold dread from\nearlier. Magnified. The Set’s plan, the danger Autonomy posed … Marasi\nglanced down; she was still holding the picture Maraga had dug out. Ash\nfalling from the sky, burying cities that had been destroyed.\n“What do we do?” Wayne asked.\n“Let me think,” Wax said. “How much bendalloy do you have? Are we\nwasting it?”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “I’ve got plenty.”\n“He’s been saving it,” Marasi said, “and learning to be responsible with\nhis finances and his use of metals.”\nWax glanced at him. “Who’d you take the money from?”\n“Someone worthless,” Wayne said.\n“Remind me to check my bank accounts,” Wax said, “if there are any\nbanks left after all of this. For now, the most urgent matter is the bomb.\nThey have it ready, but can’t deliver it. So we need to find whatever device\nthey’re setting up to launch the thing, then stop it.”\n“Maraga says the Set is using the bunkers under the city as a kind of\nbase,” Marasi said. “If we can sneak in, maybe we can find the mechanism.\nOr at least learn its location.”\n“Hard to sneak anywhere,” Wayne said, nodding toward Telsin, “with\nsome kind of demigod thing watchin’ you.”\nWax thought for a moment. “I need to confront Telsin, deal with her,\nmaybe try to get information out of her. I want to find that bomb and stop it.\nI might be able to sort the lies from the truth. But I do agree, trying to get\ninto their base could be valuable. Not sure how we’d manage it though.”\nMarasi glanced at Moonlight, frozen outside the speed bubble. What did\nshe make of all this? Did she have answers?\nMaybe Marasi should tell Wax. Only … would that break Moonlight’s\nfrail trust in her? The woman could easily vanish again, as she’d done after\nthe fight at the warehouse.\nSo many secrets. Marasi had become a constable in part to reveal secrets\n—and here, in working with Moonlight, she had a chance. At something\nbigger. Something more important. Secrets beyond secrets. She needed\nmore time to pry information out of Moonlight.\n“Wax,” she said, “we should split up.”\nHe met her eyes. “Two teams,” he said. “You find a way into the"

I deal with Telsin and follow any leads I get from her.”\n“Exactly,” Marasi said. “I think Kim is trustworthy. She and I had a\nchance to chat when we were at the archive, and she knows a lot about the\ncity. With her help, I might be able to locate an entrance to the caverns. In\nthere are secrets, maybe the location of the bomb. But an infiltration like\nthat will take time. Maybe too much time.”\n“So Wayne and I take a direct route,” Wax said. “We interrogate Telsin\nand locate the bomb that way.”\n“She’ll play with your mind, mate,” Wayne said.\n“I know. But she’s my sister. I … I need to do this.” Wax took a deep\nbreath. “If I’m right, she’ll have to give me bits of truth along with her lies.\nIf we can play the game better than she does, it might lead us to the\nweapon.”\n“Right,” Marasi said. “Whatever you find, send to Steris and Captain\nReddi via radio. I’ll do the same. That way, we can consolidate our\ninformation and leave notes for one another.”\nWax nodded, but seemed reluctant.\n“You worry local radio operators might be compromised?” Marasi said.\n“It’s possible,” he said. “But I don’t know of a better way. I’m going to\nsend something to Steris as soon as we leave here.”\n“Will you write to Allik too?” she asked. “Remind him I asked him to\nleave the city? It’s selfish of me, but…”\n“It’s all right,” Wax said. “It’s not selfish to want to save those you\nlove.” He paused. “I don’t know if we’ll have a chance to meet up again\nbefore the day is done. So if you don’t hear from me, Marasi, know that I\ntrust your judgment. If you have a chance to stop the bomb, do so.\nWhatever the cost.”\n“Same for you,” she said. “All right. Let’s split.” Wax nodded to Wayne,\nwho dropped the speed bubble.\nAnd just like that, Marasi had put herself in a position to interrogate\nMoonlight freely. She would share what she found with Wax. And he would\nunderstand. She felt she should have been embarrassed for keeping this\nfrom him, but in truth she was excited.\nWax walked over to Telsin. “You and I need to talk,” he said to her.\n“Agreed,” she said, starting up the steps.\nWax moved to follow, pausing briefly to say something to Maraga.\nBefore Wayne joined him, he took Marasi by the arm. “Hey,” he said softly.\n“Be careful with that Kim character. I think she’s fakin’ about somethin’.”\n“I appreciate the warning,” Marasi said. “I think she knows more than\nshe’s saying, but I don’t think she’s working for the enemy.”\n“Right,” he said. “Hey, you take care of yourself.”\n“You too, Wayne.”\n“Don’t I always?”"

After six years together, I’ve\ngotta let you march away alone. Without my keen observations on life and\nthe world to keep you on your toes.”\nShe smiled, then raised her fist for him to tap with his own. “I’m glad\nyou walked out of the stories and into my life. I’d rather have a friend than\na legend.”\n“Same.”\n“Wayne, no one is calling me a legend.”\n“They will,” he said with a wink. “You take care. We’ll see you later\ntonight.” He slipped an old bowler hat off a rack near the center of the\nroom. He put it on and left a stapler tied with a ribbon hanging in its place.\nWhere had he found that?\nWax and Wayne disappeared up the steps behind Telsin, leaving Marasi\nalone with Moonlight, Maraga, and the whole cosmere’s worth of secrets.\nPART THREE\n35\nWax nodded to Wayne, and together they dashed out of the newspaper\nbuilding—Wax pulling Telsin behind him—and into the cover between two\nnearby apartment buildings.\nTelsin sighed as they stopped, then straightened her suit jacket. “Was\nthat necessary?”\nWax gestured, and Wayne scrambled farther along the alleyway to scout\nthe area.\n“There are no snipers,” Telsin said. “You aren’t surrounded. It’s just\nme.”\nWax ignored her, absently clicking the chambers on Vindication one at a\ntime. Watching the sky, because each time he looked at her he felt pain.\nBetrayal. He’d told Marasi he could handle Telsin. But now he questioned\nthat. When had he ever gotten the better of her? She’d always made a fool\nof him.\nThis is what you came here to do, he told himself. This is why you put\nthe coat back on. Because you know she has to be dealt with somehow.\n“What if I towed you to Elendel,” he said, “and threw you in prison.\nWould you just go along with it?”\n“Of course not,” she said. “I came to talk. To persuade you.”\n“Of what?”\nShe met his eyes. “To run, Wax. Return to the Roughs. Take your wife,\nyour children, and leave. You have time. Step away and let me do what\nneeds to be done. I’d rather you lived.”\n“Where was that inclination six years ago?” he asked. “On that\nmountaintop?”\nShe sighed, as if at his childishness, then leaned against the wall of the\nalley. “I didn’t want to shoot you, Wax. I didn’t expect you to show up and\nundermine our plans, and I had to do what was required in the moment.\n“Wax, I know you. I know you’re overwhelmed by this.

If you can trust in one thing, trust in my sense of self-preservation.\nElendel has to be destroyed. Or else.”\n“Or else Autonomy destroys the entire Basin?”\n“She has an army,” Telsin said, looking away. “Men of gold and red …\nwaiting for me to fail. Breathing over my proverbial shoulder. Our best\nhope is for me to prove I can rule this planet for her—and I need to remove\nthe leadership of Elendel before I can do that.” She focused on him. “We’ll\nbe better off with her guiding us. Harmony is useless, as you’ve\nundoubtedly learned by now. We need someone stronger.”\n“Someone who by coincidence,” he said, “wants you to represent her.”\n“It is a job that needs to be done.”\n“I’d rather it be done by practically anyone but you.”\n“You don’t get to make that decision.” Telsin looked up toward the sky.\n“Once I’m fully Invested—once I’m a Sliver of Autonomy—you’ll see. I’ll\nrebuild the Basin. Make it as modern and efficient as Bilming. You realize\nthat Harmony has crippled us? Life is too easy in the Basin, too lush.\nThere’s no conflict or strife, so we don’t innovate, don’t grow. That’s what\nAutonomy has taught me.”\nWax, feeling cold, stepped toward her. “So the solution is to annihilate\nElendel? Nearly half our entire population?”\nShe continued staring at the sky.\n“Telsin,” he said, “this insane plan won’t work. The South will invade\nthe moment we’re perceived as weak. The Outer Cities will rebel in horror\nat what you’ve done. I know the mayors of those cities. They’re frustrated,\nbut they’re not monsters.\n“By destroying Elendel, you’d throw us into chaos. And yes, you’ll have\nstrife. But it will end us, as surely as if Autonomy had attacked. This won’t\ngive you what you want. Autonomy is playing you. Have you considered\nthat? Maybe she wants you to destroy the Basin so she doesn’t have to\nbother.”\nAgain, Telsin didn’t look at him. And rusts, he felt like he’d put together\nanother piece. Harmony had talked about Autonomy and the way she\npushed people to survive, to prove themselves. A destroyed city might seem\nlike a ruthless enough move to accomplish that, which was why Telsin was\npursuing it.\nBut what about the letter indicating the involvement of Elendel\nsenators? he thought. This is wrong. I’m making guesses based on\nincomplete information.\n“Come on,” Telsin said, turning to climb up a fire escape. “I hate the\nsmell of alleys.”"

An\naluminum bullet with a secondary explosive that would blast after it lodged\ninto her—a brutal shell capable of ripping off limbs. Ranette had designed it\nfor him after he’d discovered the Bands of Mourning and had expressed\ninterest in ways to forcibly remove spikes from bodies.\nTelsin continued up the fire escape, indifferent.

Wax raised Vindication beside his head, then dropped a bullet\nwith the other hand and used it to launch himself up past Telsin onto the\nroof. She joined him a short time later, and they both looked out over the\ncity.\n“Life really would have been far simpler,” she said, “if you’d stayed in\nthe Roughs, Wax.”\n“Then you and Edwarn shouldn’t have vanished.”\n“We had to go into hiding,” she said. “Did Harmony tell you what\nhappened to our parents?”\n“It was … an accident…”\n“It was agents of Harmony, trying to get to me. Did Harmony ever admit\nthat to you?” She strolled past him. “No, I expect not, based on your\nexpression.”\nDon’t let her play you, Wax.

Better,\nmaybe you should be asking me for help. If Autonomy has an army ready to\nstrike, then we should be figuring out how to fight it together.”\nTelsin stopped at the edge of the building, elbows on the stone railing,\ncontemplative. “It’s pretty, don’t you think? A city of the future. All\nsymmetrical, like a perfect face. A beauty without blemish.”\n“Telsin,” Wax said, stepping up to her.\n“Oh, stop with the gritty constable growl, Wax,” she said. “You see this\ncity? Six years under my direction, and it’s doing far better than Elendel.\nYou have to admit we’ve been too sheltered. The Malwish are beyond us,\nand you haven’t even seen what other planets are capable of doing. We’re\nso far behind. We’re vulnerable.”\n“I don’t see how blowing up the capital is going to change that, Telsin.”\n“Because you’ve always lacked vision, Wax,” she said. “When\nsomething truly expansive lies before you, instead of comprehending it, you\nrun.”\nWax kept his distance. “Why did you come to see me, Telsin?” he asked.\n“What is this really about?”\n“Sibling affection?” she said. Then smiled as he gave her a flat glance in\nresponse. “I simply want you gone. Out of the equation. You interfering is\nbad. Even when you inevitably fail.”\nHer brother showing up to ruin things is bad, he thought. Telsin glanced\naway again, but he sensed a tension in her posture. She was legitimately\nworried that her plans wouldn’t come together—that Autonomy would\nsimply send in her armies."

We shouldn’t have to share.”\n“You planted stolen cash on your own cousin to achieve it. And even\nthat wasn’t your end goal—you wanted to live alone so that you could\nsneak out.

But\nstopping a bomb is something I can solve. Something I will solve.”\nShe sighed, seeing only the dogged lawman. Her little brother and his\nfantasies.\n“You have no idea…” she whispered, looking away. “You can’t stop\nthis, Wax. Even if you did find the bomb, there are redundancies upon\nredundancies to make sure that Autonomy gets what she wants. We need to\nprove ourselves. And I’m going to do that.”\nRedundancies. What did she mean by that? It didn’t sound like the army\nAutonomy was supposedly sending. Were there other, internal pressures?\nRivals? He took a guess.\n“Gave Entrone,” he said, “is trying to overtake you. Seize your\nposition.”\n“Entrone is a coward,” she said. “He won’t move against me. Wax,\nyou’re not half as smart as you think you are.”\nHe might not see it all, true—but if Entrone was a coward, then maybe\nWax was interrogating the wrong person. He doubted he could break Telsin.\nBut clearly there was someone else who knew these plans.\nSo, I get Entrone to break, he thought.\n“You ever stand up someplace high,” Telsin said, “and feel the\nirresistible urge to throw yourself off?”\n“No,” Wax said, frowning. “If I want to, I jump. If I don’t, I don’t.”\n“The curse of Steelpushing,” she said, staring out over the city. “You\ncan’t feel it. The call to do something dramatic, drastic, impressive.”\n“The urge to kill yourself on a whim?” Wax asked, baffled.\n“The opportunity to be afraid,” she whispered. “To do something\nthrilling and new. You know, I resisted getting the spikes for Steelpushing\nand Ironpulling? I didn’t want to lose my nervousness around heights. Then\nI found new fears, new challenges, new ambitions.”\nWax nodded slowly. That was his Telsin. The woman who always\npushed recklessly for more. More power. But also more experiences. More\nnovelty. More control over others.\n“There’s an entire cosmere out there,” she said to him. “Few ever see or\nknow it. But I have a chance to. A real chance. I’m not going to let you take\nthat from me. I’m telling you, Wax, I’m not going to pull my punches. I’ll\ndo whatever it takes.”\n“And I’ll stop you. Whatever it takes.”\n“Ever the moralist,” she said, glancing at him. “Standing so tall,\npretending you see so high, when in reality you can barely grasp the\nproblems you’re trying to fix. I’ve already solved them. Do you want to\nhear of Trell? Autonomy? What it means to be her avatar?”\nA part of him did.

She was talking to him because she had to keep him\ndistracted. The trick wasn’t to realize that she was stalling, it was to\nrecognize that as long as he let her tease him with information, she held all\nthe cards.\nThere was only one way to win this particular game. And that was to\nleave the table.\n“She’s going to destroy us?” he said, strolling across the top of the roof\nbehind her.\n“Unless I prove to her that we’re worth saving,” she explained, turning\nto survey the city. As before, she didn’t seem to care that she had her back\nto him. “Autonomy is … odd. She respects those who are bold, strong, able\nto survive on their own. But she also wants them to obey her. I suppose that\nis the irony of godhood. Half the time, being ‘autonomous’ means following\nher plan. And there’s no Whimsy to her—that’s a different god.\n“Autonomy is rugged individualism filtered through the lens of a god\nwho thinks she knows best. And in that context, individualism is a virtue\nbest applied to finding ways to carry out the plans she has outlined. You get\nto be individual in your chosen path to do what she says…”\nWax missed the next part, as he had quietly slipped over the side of the\nroof. With luck, she’d keep right on talking, giving him time to get away.\n36\nMarasi and Moonlight hurriedly finished up in the basement—Moonlight\ngrabbing a last few rubbings of the wall plates and tucking them away in\nher case. Together they then climbed to the main floor, where they found the\ngrey-haired editor Maraga standing in the center of a cluttered room,\nholding an overstuffed travel bag and looking frazzled.\n“On his way out,” she said to Marasi, “Dawnshot told me to go to\nfamily in the countryside. But all of my family is either here or in Elendel.\nShould I … go to them?”\n“Probably not wise,” Marasi said. Any family in Bilming would be\neasily tracked down by the Set, and Elendel … well, it had a massive bomb\npointed at it.\nThat thought filled Marasi with worry. But she needed to focus on\npreventing the disaster. She had to leave helping Elendel to her sister.\n“Moonlight,” Marasi said, “surely there’s a place in the city you could\nsend Maraga? A place of safety for someone who did us such great\nservice?”\nMoonlight considered for a moment. She wasn’t the type to rush into\nthings, it seemed. Careful. Calculating. Finally she slipped a small card\nfrom her sleeve, marked with the interlocking diamond symbol. “Do you\nknow the Knightbridge district?”\n“Yes,” Maraga said, hesitantly taking the card.\n“Go to Thirty-Third and Finete, house number one eighty-seven. Knock,\nshow them this, and tell them Moonlight said you could ask for asylum as\nrecompense for services rendered. They’ll take you in. Even the Set will\nhave trouble assaulting that place.”\n“Thank you,” the woman said, clutching the card to her chest."

You need to go. Quickly.”\n“I’m going to fetch my sister too,” Maraga said. “Please?”\n“If you must,” Moonlight said. “But be warned, since the Set knows\nwe’re here, each moment you waste endangers your life.”\nMaraga rushed to the door. She paused to look over what she was\nleaving, then steeled herself and hurried out.\n“What about us?” Moonlight asked.\n“We need to determine a likely entry point to the underground caverns,”\nMarasi said. “Do you have maps of enemy movements? Lists of places you\nthink might be owned by the Set?”\n“Not on me,” Moonlight said. “Perhaps we could return to the records\noffice and do some research.”\n“I think I have a better idea,” Marasi said, leading the way out the front\ndoor. “Riskier, but hopefully faster.”\n“I’m intrigued,” Moonlight said, joining her as they walked to a busier\nstreet where—with some effort—Marasi managed to flag down a cab. She\nfound it amazing how quickly coachmen had made the swap between horse-\ndrawn carriages and motorcabs.\nThey settled in the rear of the motorcar, and the cabbie—a woman with\ndark hair in a ponytail—glanced back at them. “Where to?”\n“Knightbridge district,” Marasi said. “Thirty-Third and Finete.”\nThe cabbie nodded, pulling out into the flow of traffic and taking them\nwestward.\n“Clever,” Moonlight said to Marasi. “I’m going to have to watch myself\naround you. But what makes you think our safehouse will have the maps\nyou want?”\n“You found me in the caverns beneath Elendel,” Marasi said. “Plus, a\nmoment ago you implied such maps existed—you didn’t have them ‘on\nyou.’ Ergo, I assumed this was a good path forward. Your people will have\nthe information we need.”\n“They might not let you in,” Moonlight said. “What then? You’ll have\nwasted time.”\n“Wasted time,” Marasi snapped. “Wasted time?” She glanced toward the\ncabbie, uncertain what she should say.\n“Darkwater, dear,” Moonlight said to the cabbie, “give us a little\nprivacy.”\n“Sure thing, Moonlight,” the cabbie said, shutting the window\nseparating the front of the car from the back.\nMarasi gaped. Then she looked at Moonlight, who shrugged.\n“Moonlight,” Marasi said, focusing her thoughts, “what kind of game do\nyou think we’re playing? Didn’t you say your entire purpose was protecting\nthis planet? Now you imply you’d keep me locked out of your safehouse,\nand the vital information it contains?”\nMoonlight settled in her seat, thoughtful. “My organization,” she\neventually said, “was created to protect and advance the needs of the planet\nScadrial.

There are terrible forces moving in the cosmere; my people are\ngoing to need allies.”\n“So why are you so resistant to helping me?”\n“To be honest,” Moonlight said, “I’m worried we’re being played.\nAutonomy is adept at misdirection, at false leads and confusing shadows of\nhalf-truths. Restarting the ashfalls? That seems … outrageous. Impossible\neven for her. Something is off about all this. A shade too red to be natural.”\n“So help me find the truth, Moonlight,” Marasi said. “Stop toying with\nme.”\n“I’m not toying with you,” Moonlight said. “This is an audition.”\nMarasi blinked. What?\n“Until a little while ago,” Moonlight continued, “I assumed we had\nmonths to unravel the Set’s plan.” She tapped her armrest with a fingernail,\nthen looked at her bag, where the rubbings she’d taken were peeking out.\nDuring their short time working together, Marasi had started to see\nMoonlight as all-knowing—someone mysterious, alien. But that concern in\nher eyes, the way she was fighting uncertainty … that was all too human.\n“I’ll let you into the safehouse,” Moonlight finally said. “And deal with\nthe ramifications later, if this proves to all be another of Autonomy’s\nshadow games. But I’m not sure I can give you everything you want.\n“We don’t have the caverns in the city mapped, but we do watch their\nagents.” She patted her bag, and the rubbings. “This lists coordinates of the\nexplosions. So if we compare where the blasts have been happening with\nthe places where Set agents appear and vanish…”\n“… We might be able to find a way into their testing facility,” Marasi\nsaid. “I did something similar to locate that cavern under Elendel.”\n“I remember when all this started to hit me,” Moonlight said softly.\n“When my world expanded, and my personal squabbles—even the ones that\ninfluenced the fates of empires—suddenly became so small. You’re doing\nremarkably well.”\n“My life,” Marasi said, “has mostly been expanses of quiet humdrum\npunctuated by sudden explosions—usually literal ones—of activity. I’m\nused to working under pressure.”\n“And dealing with gods?” Moonlight said. “Fighting their influence?”\n“Well, we have one on our own side, after all.”\n“Kind of,” Moonlight said. “Harmony isn’t terribly reliable these days.\nAt least not in the ways my mentor would prefer. It’s less like having a god\non your side—and more like having a powerful referee who only sometimes\npays attention to your fight.”\n“Or an observer,” Marasi said, “who you’re sure could do more to help,\nbut doesn’t for some baffling reason.”\n“Yes, like…” Moonlight narrowed her eyes. “Point made. Here, we’re\napproaching the safehouse. Hopefully the Survivor hasn’t returned\nunexpectedly. My mentor isn’t always reasonable when it comes to people\nhe sees as Harmony’s agents, and might respond … poorly.”\n37\nWayne had read a real interesting book once about a fellow what went back\nin time.

        "text": "he sees as Harmony’s agents, and might respond … poorly.”\n37\nWayne had read a real interesting book once about a fellow what went back\nin time. It had happened because he’d turned on too many electric switches\nat once. That was ridiculous, but the book had been written when electricity\nhad been new—so it was forgivable. People had thought some funny stuff\nabout electricity back then. Wayne himself had tried to fill a bucket with it\nonce.\nHe found himself thinking of that story as he scoured the nearby alleys\nfor signs of the Set’s agents. See, the book had been all about how changing\nthe past was this dangerous thing. The fellow in it had broken some\nbranches off a tree, and when he’d returned to the future, his father had\nliked eating butter on his sandwiches instead of mayo. Also, sapient lions\nhad ruled the city.\nWayne had thought there was something … off about the story. When\nhe’d mentioned it to friends, Nod had told him of another one with the same\nidea, where a fellow was sent back in time through the intricacies of indoor\nplumbing and an unfortunately large flush. And he had changed things by\neating a bagel, then returned to discover that everybody spoke backward\nand no one wore shirts anymore.\nThis book had been better than the first one on account of it having more\ncussing—plus the no-shirts part being universally applied and very\ndescriptively relayed—but still, Wayne found the idea uncomfortable.\nHe traded a beggar—unbeknownst to the fellow—a stack of cash for a\ndirty handkerchief; Wayne liked it on account of it havin’ a little bunny\nsewn in the corner. He was starting to figure out why those stories bothered\nhim. They had this sense that changing the future was frightening and\ndangerous.\nBut didn’t people change it every day?\nWayne wondered regarding the choices people made. Rushing through\ntheir lives eating bagels, breaking twigs. Each of them changing the future.\nShouldn’t they all … worry about that a little more? Worry how they were\nchanging the future right now, rather than writing books about people doing\nit in the past? Even if they couldn’t know some things, there was a lot they\ncould anticipate. They might not make that future have talking lions or\nwhatnot—but they might make it have angrier, sadder people.\nMaybe stories about fellows quietly making the world better were just\ntoo dull. Sounded boring, actually. Maybe if the people in them wore no\nshirts …\nA hand wrapped around Wayne’s mouth from behind. He almost killed\nthe fellow—but it smelled like Wax, so …\nYup, it was Wax. The man eased Wayne back into an alleyway, then\npulled him down beside some rubbish as someone passed on the street.\nTelsin, searching around, annoyed.\nAfter she was gone, Wax removed his hand.\n“You let her go?” Wayne whispered.\n“Call me crazy—”\n“You’re crazy.”\n“—but it feels more like I escaped.” Wax nodded his head in the other\ndirection and they snuck away.\n“I have to say,” Wayne muttered, “that there are better methods of\ngettin’ my attention. You’re not supposed to take friends captive, Wax,\nunless it involves a safeword and stretchy ropes.”\n“Stretchy ropes?”"

You’re not supposed to take friends captive, Wax,\nunless it involves a safeword and stretchy ropes.”\n“Stretchy ropes?”\n“More fun if you can move a little,” Wayne said. “I got to test them,\nsince I had to be the one getting tied up. You know, on account of the fact\nthat my girlfriend could turn into a puddle of jelly on command. Kind of\nundermines the point of bondage.”\nWax groaned softly as they slipped out onto the street. “I did not need to\nknow any of that, Wayne. Could you maybe avoid being crass on the\nmissions Harmony specifically sent us on?”\n“Hey now,” Wayne said. “That’s not crass. MeLaan is a divine being.\nChosen by Harmony. I figure, dating her was basically like going to church,\nyou know?”\n“And the stretchy ropes?”\n“A, uh, metaphor for us all being bound by God’s will?”\nThey shared a look, then Wax actually grinned as he shook his head.\nGood. Guy was too uptight these days, what with parenthood, bein’ a\nsenator, and having to save the whole damn city now and then.\nHoid pulled up in the car to get them, per Wayne’s earlier request—but\nTelsin was still lurking around. So Wax and Wayne slipped out another way\nand entered a busy street of bustling people. Full of Bilming idiots what had\nno idea how difficult they was making life. Though he supposed that was\ntoo much of a generalization. There were plenty of people in Bilming that\nweren’t idiots—they came from out of town to gawk at all the idiots.\n“Did you get a lead out of Telsin?” Wayne asked as they blended into\nthe crowd.\n“Maybe,” Wax said.\n“Well, I’ve definitely got a lead.”\n“You do? Thank Harmony.”\n“Yup. There’s a shining good pub three streets over. Two different bums\nswore by it.”\nWayne earned a real good glare out of that one. Made him feel all proud\nof himself. Smiles, then glares, then smiles, then glares. They pulled at a\nperson like taffy, keeping them limber.\n“I had to get away from Telsin,” Wax said. “I’m sure she was stalling,\ntrying to keep me occupied.”\n“Seems like she’s worried we can stop her.”\n“Agreed. Which is encouraging. But I won’t get anything useful from\nher. Not in time. We need someone else to interrogate, and she gave me a\nlead: I think the lord mayor deserves a visit.”\n“Here now,” Wayne said. “Now that’s an idea.”\nThey stopped on the street, people giving them a wide berth. The folks\nhere seemed to dress with a lot more variety than in Elendel, but nobody\nwore guns. Wax stood out like a big ol’ wart on a fellow’s face. The type\nthat you really wanted to pop to see what oozed out.\n“We don’t exactly blend in, do we?” Wax said.\n“Mate, you’re wearing a rusting mistcoat.”\n“They’re comfy.”\n“They draw attention.”\n“You like attention!”\n“Depends on who’s looking.” He eyed Wax. “Never have figured out"

Mistcoats appeared like a regular piece of clothing, but Wayne\nwas sure they was secretly something else. Made of mist or such—and\nsince Harmony liked Wax, the coat didn’t trip him.\nWasn’t fair that God liked Wax better. Wayne didn’t mean to blaspheme\nwhen he got drunk, it just slipped out. And really, if the blasphemy leaked\nout, didn’t that mean he was more pious afterward? That was why he got\ndrunk so often. That, and absolutely no other reason.\nThe two of them moved to the side of the street, in the mouth of an\nalleyway, to plan. Wax glared right smartly at anyone who gawked, sending\nthem on their way.\n“So,” Wax said, “we should choose our next course soon. Because if I\nsomehow actually managed to lose the Set when slipping away from Telsin,\nthey’ll surely spot us before too long.”\n“’Cuz you stand out like pink shoes on a pallbearer.”\n“’Cuz I stand out like pink shoes on a pallbearer.”\n“I like the idea of shakin’ down Entrone,” Wayne said. “On principle, at\nleast. But I worry about how much attention that would draw. So maybe we\ndon’t need to interrogate him specifically. After all, we do know where he\nlives.”\nWayne pointed across the city, up the road, to the silvery-white building\nsitting at the end. It wasn’t the highest building in town. The central spire,\ndominating the very middle of the city, was the highest by a lot. And they\nwere even adding to it at the top, it seemed, with new construction.\nStill, there was a certain majesty about the mayor’s mansion. The kind\nthat said, “Oi, mate! Don’t use words like ‘oi, mate’ ’round here.”\n“Entrone,” Wayne said, “is obviously involved in all this. He’s the type\nto have secrets written down somewhere, maybe give us a lead on where\nthat bomb is being kept. He’s probably got a safe or something full of\nanswers.”\n“You just said shaking him down would create another incident,” Wax\nsaid, his hands on his hips, holstered guns jutting out and making basically\neverybody nearby nervous. “Now you’re suggesting we ransack his\nmansion?”\n“I’m suggesting,” Wayne said, giving it a nice upper-class, Fifth Octant,\nold-money accent, “that once we have completed our radio communication,\nwe give the esteemed lord mayor an evening turn-down service with mints\non his pillow, folded towels in the shape of a monkey, and a light despoiling\nof his intimate affairs. Done with only the most delicate attention, mind\nyou. A courteous looting. An … upper-class plundering.”\n“Is that so?” Wax said.\nWayne leaned in. “I mean, we’ll still break all his stuff and steal his\nsecrets. I just won’t fart on his chair before we go. You know. To keep\nthings classy.”"

Let’s do it.”\nWayne grinned.\n“But I’ll do the ransacking,” Wax said. “You handle the distraction.”\n38\nSteris threw open the door to the governor’s chamber, where he was holding\nhis private council on what to do about Bilming. Then held that door open\nfor Constable-General Reddi. He’d been invited to the meeting along with\nhis staff. Today that included two other people: Constable Gorglen as record\nkeeper. And Steris.\nThe governor sat at the head of the meeting table. Adawathwyn\nimmediately glared at Steris through dark brown eyes. The three senators—\nLord Cett, Lady Hammondess, and Lady Gardre—were in attendance, as\nwell as Ambassador Daal, his expression unreadable behind his bloodred\nmask. The shorter man hadn’t taken a seat at the table, but instead stood by\nthe wall, his posture prim and sharp.\n“Ah, finally,” the governor said, looking up from the broadsheets.\n“Reddi. You … Wait. What is she doing here?”\n“Lady Ladrian?” Reddi said. “Subject matter expert, on my payroll.”\nAs of fifteen minutes ago, at least. Steris had insisted he actually pay\nher, and she clutched the single coin in her fist as she shut the door behind\nReddi. Then she stepped forward and sat down at the table beside him.\n“Did she tell you,” the governor said, “that I specifically excluded her\nfrom this council?”\n“Yes, she did,” Reddi replied. “And frankly, Your Grace, I thought that\nan unwise move. She’s the wife of the man who alerted us to this crisis.\nWhen Lady Ladrian approached me and explained why I should employ\nher, I realized she’d undoubtedly have information this council needs.”\nThe vice governor folded her arms on the table, scowling. But the\ngovernor … he nodded. Steris always hesitated to read too much into\npeople’s expressions, but now she wondered. Was there a rift between these\ntwo? She’d always assumed Varlance was entirely in Adawathwyn’s pocket.\nBut then, no person ever fit comfortably in a pocket.\n“Very well,” the governor said. “I’m afraid we started without you. As\nthe information has come in and we’ve gauged the feelings of Outer Cities\ngovernments, we’ve come to see that our path is inevitable. It looks like\nwar.”\n“War?” Reddi said.\n“It’s the necessary course of action,” Lady Hammondess said. She had a\nsmall gap between her front teeth, of the sort men often described as cute—\nas if it were the reason for her beauty rather than her flawless skin, delicate\nfeatures, and long lashes. Curious, how minor flaws became cute when their\nbearer also happened to be conventionally attractive. “The Outer Cities are\nbuilding up for war.”\n“Warships in Bilming,” Lord Cett agreed.

He was a striking man, if you\nliked the smooth and well-dressed sort. Steris wondered how much work it\ntook to keep one’s rough edges so contained behind powders and soft\nclothing. “Railroad blockades to the south. Recruitment flyers in the\nRoughs, offering jobs for ‘security forces.’”\n“Which is why,” Constable Reddi said, “we need to work so hard to\nsoothe the situation and reconcile!”\n“Better,” Lady Hammondess said, “we should strike first. We’ve been\nignoring the warning signs for too long. If we don’t move soon, we will not\nbe able to win.”\nSteris glanced at Lady Gardre, the third of the nobles in the room. The\nplump woman was much less of a war hawk than the others, far more\nreasonable. But even she nodded, reluctantly. And it did make sense. Every\nday that Elendel dithered gave the other cities time to build power. Elendel\nhad the advantage of infrastructure, manufacturing, and coordination. But\nthat wouldn’t remain an edge for long.\nStriking first made sense if you thought war was inevitable. But it\nwasn’t. It didn’t have to be.\nThis was the enemy’s plan. She was increasingly certain that saber-\nrattling in the Outer Cities was a cover for whatever weapon was being\nprepared in Bilming.\nReddi began sputtering. “War with what army? Elendel has barely ten\nthousand troops, and that’s counting our navy protecting shipping to the\nSouth!”\n“We have conscription plans in place,” Adawathwyn said smoothly.\n“And we have a very capably trained constabulary.”\nReddi seemed horrified by that statement. Steris had something to add,\nbut she hesitated. Was this the part where she spoke? She could rarely figure\nthat out.\n“My people,” Reddi said, “are not soldiers.”\n“Pardon, constable,” Lord Cett said, leaning across the table. “But no\none is a soldier until they’re trained to be.”\n“We’re needed,” Reddi explained. “Law—”\n“We’ll be under martial law,” the governor explained. “Policing crime\nin the city will get a lot easier with curfews. You can put excess constables\ninto the military force.”\nMaybe this was the part where she should speak. Steris opened her\nmouth and made a noise to that effect, but they kept talking straight over\nher.\n“I won’t stand for this!” Reddi said, throwing himself—paradoxically—\nto his feet. “This is not the oath my constables swore!”\n“You don’t get to choose, constable,” the governor said. “I hold your\ncommission, and that of every constable in this city. They ultimately answer\nto me.”\n“We can quit, Varlance,” Reddi said, leaning forward, his hands on the\ntable. “You can’t force us to fight.”\n“I—” Steris started.\n“Actually,” Adawathwyn said lightly, “that’s precisely what a draft is,\nConstable Reddi.”\n“I would—” Steris tried again.\n“Yeah?” Reddi snapped. “And who exactly is going to lock us up?”"

You’d be surprised at how often the option is relevant.”\nWell, now she had their attention.\n“If we are worried about war,” she said, “we should immediately begin\nan evacuation of the city.”\n“No good,” Cett said. “If there is war, we need workers to facilitate\nindustry—and to ramp up production of munitions.”\nRusts. That was the correct answer. She’d hoped he wouldn’t have\nthought that far forward. She glanced at the silent Malwish ambassador.\nWhat did he think of all of this? Had he anticipated it? She had always kept\nher focus on members of the Set in the Basin. But who was to say there\nweren’t members among the Malwish as well? Rusts.\n“War is not the answer,” she said, turning back to the group. “It serves\nour enemies, not us. Look, I made a list here, to prove the logic of what I\nsay. I’m increasingly convinced that the leaders of the Outer Cities want us\nto be passing legislation that restricts and insults them. They want us\ninterfering.\n“They have built gunships and militaries, but they have not attacked.\nThey caught Waxillium in their midst, shooting up a warehouse, but what\nhaven’t they done? They haven’t expelled our constables or officials from\nthe city. They’ve shouted about it, they’ve drawn up editorials. But they\nhaven’t attacked. Why not?”\n“Because they need us to do it,” Reddi said. “They need us to give them\na reason to go to war.”\n“The common people of the Basin don’t want to fight,” Steris said.\n“Certainly not against Elendel—where they undoubtedly have family.”\n“Or because they don’t think they can win,” Lord Cett said.\nSteris looked down at her notes. “That’s … unfortunately a real\npossibility.”\n“Why is that unfortunate?” Reddi asked.\n“Because,” Steris said, “if they know they can’t defeat us in open war\nthey might do something desperate. Like unleash a weapon of cataclysmic\nrelevance.”\n“Returning to your real point,” Adawathwyn said. “This bomb you keep\nharping on.”\nBut Governor Varlance was watching her. He was listening.\n“My husband,” Steris said, “is in Bilming investigating it as we speak.\nHe produced a terribly dangerous explosion in our laboratory, using rare\nmaterials we know the enemy has. We have traced a set of test explosions in\ncaverns underneath Bilming. Something is happening.”\nShe met the governor’s eyes. “And if our fears about a bomb are true,”\nshe said softly, “then the posturing—manipulating us into the position of a\nbully and tyrant who needs to be resisted—might be intended to give the\nleaders of the Outer Cities a justification. A way to explain why they had to\ntake such extreme measures. Like destroying us all.”"

Like destroying us all.”\nThe room quieted, but then Lady Gardre shook her head. “Are we really\nentertaining these fancies? Doomsday weapons? The real politics of the\nsituation aren’t enough?”\nShe, Steris realized, looking at the quiet woman, must be the member of\nthe Set. She’d assumed there would be at least one moving among the\npolitical elite of Elendel. For a while she’d worried it was the governor or\nAdawathwyn, but they were both too obvious. The Set liked to move\nbeneath layers of obscurity.\nThe governor was far too prominent, and Adawathwyn too actively\nworking for things the Set wanted. She was a decoy; she likely assumed she\nwas the mastermind of her own designs. In actuality, she was just another\npuppet. Encouraged, but left clean so that her eventual downfall wouldn’t\nlead to real conspirators. Who included, smartly, the woman who was seen\nas the most reasonable. The most rational.\nSteris felt far more comfortable upon identifying her. It was like …\nfinding a snake in your intimates drawer. Yes, it was alarming. But at least\nyou could close the drawer and know where it was.\nBut how to steer the conversation in defiance of that woman? Ah.\nPerhaps that?\nShe turned to the constables. “This might be the right time to reveal\nyourself,” she said.\n“Huh?” Reddi asked.\n“Not you, Constable-General,” she said, looking past him toward the\nlanky Constable Gorglen—the younger man with a long neck and freckles.\nSo unassuming. He met her eyes.\n“How did you know?” he asked in a grinding, rough voice that didn’t\nmatch his frame.\n“Process of elimination,” she said. “We were promised help, and\nMeLaan said there were multiple kandra among the constables, but gave\nonly one name. Plus, you walk awkwardly when you have to use a two-\nlegged body.”\n“Damn,” Gorglen—TenSoon—said. “But I suppose you’re right about\nthe timing.” He stood up before the room of surprised people and made his\nskin transparent. “Harmony would like me to impress upon you the\nimportance of our current debate—and to confirm what Lady Ladrian is\nsaying. The Set is real. They are planning to annihilate Elendel.”\nThe governor gasped.\nAdawathwyn drew back.\nReddi gaped, then spun on Steris. “Why didn’t you tell me?”\n“I wasn’t a hundred percent certain until earlier today,” Steris admitted.\n“I actually wondered if you were also kandra, Reddi. I decided against it, as\nI don’t think Harmony likes his kandra impersonating important officials.\nExcept that once. Well, and that other time. But those were exceptions.” She\nflipped open one of her notebooks. “I’ve been tracking who might have\nbeen replaced for weeks now. See? Kandra attendant to the constable-\ngeneral. Second most likely placement in the city for one of the Immortals.”\n“And the first?” Adawathwyn asked."

A kandra in your place would take far more care not\nto be an utterly worthless piece of slime.” She made a notation. The room\nwas quiet. “Oh, did I say something awkward again? I do make that mistake\nsometimes, don’t I?”\nReddi slumped back into his seat. “I can’t believe this…”\n“It was all but inevitable that they would be among your staff,\nConstable-General Reddi,” Steris said.\n“No,” he said. “It’s not that he’s kandra. It’s that … rusts, Wayne was\nright…”\n“I am TenSoon,” the kandra said to the room, eliciting another series of\ngasps. He growled softly. “I hate it when people do that. Harmony is\nworried. And so you should be worried. Especially as Harmony is … unable\nto see certain things lately. We are working blind.”\n“What can blind a god?” the governor asked.\n“Another god,” Steris mumbled.\n“So what do we do?” Reddi asked. “We can’t go to war, not if that’s\nwhat they want. But—”\nHe was interrupted by a knock at the door. There were no attendants in\nthe room, just senators and the like, so Reddi answered it himself: revealing\na young woman, a radio technician by her uniform, holding a folded piece\nof paper.\n“What is it?” Reddi demanded.\n“Communication from Dawnshot,” she said, “for Lady Ladrian. I …\num … thought it was worth interrupting you, even though the people\noutside said—”\n“You did the right thing,” Reddi said, taking it.\nThe poor woman was pale and trembling.\n“You read it?” Steris asked.\n“I had to transcribe it for you,” she said. “That’s how it works…”\nReddi handed Steris the letter, and she unfolded it. The opening words,\nbold and dominant, leaped off the page.\nBomb is confirmed real, and already fabricated. City-destroying\ncapacity. Enemy is trying to find a way to deliver it to Elendel. It’s\ntime to evacuate the city.\n39\nMarasi stood before an unassuming townhome, one in a long row of\nstructures along the street, each a different color with a slightly different\nbuilding shape. Each lawn held a different variety of tree. Bilming ideal:\nmass-produced individuality.\nMarasi hesitated on the threshold. Ruin. Was she ready to meet the\nSurvivor himself? A man she had been taught since childhood to worship, a\nman who had transcended even the grave. Who had briefly held the mantle\nof Preservation before releasing it to the Ascendant Warrior. And who had\nthen protected the people of the Southern Continent for years after the\nworld was remade.\nMoonlight was confident that her mentor really was him.

Yes it was.\nMoonlight touched her finger to a piece of metal on the door, and the\nthing unlocked. “Identity lock,” she noted, then pushed open the door. The\nsmall foyer inside was all hardwood and polish, and there were no paintings\nor other ornamentations of note. Moonlight headed to the left, into a large\nroom with thick drapes covering the windows.\nThe walls were lined with maps, illuminated by electric lights.\nMoonlight slid her bag onto a table by the far wall, where a woman in her\ntwenties—somewhat plump, with a stark blonde bob—was peering at a\npaper covered in strange writing. She had a small terrier in her lap.\n“Moonlight,” the woman said after a glance. “You have to read this.\nTravel to Bjendal has been completely upset. That’s four primary systems\nwe can’t visit without extreme danger, if you count Roshar. I’ve said it for\nyears: The perpendicularities are no longer viable. They never were good\nfor mass transportation or commerce, no matter how hard those fools on\nNalthis try. We need a different…” The woman trailed off, then turned in\nher seat, perhaps hearing Marasi stepping into the room. “Hey! You brought\na local!”\n“Marasi, meet Codenames,” Moonlight said. “Codenames, meet Marasi.\nWe’re working on a mission together.”\n“Wow,” Codenames said, thrusting the sheet of paper at Moonlight, then\nhopping to her feet, the small dog under her arm. “You must trust her.”\n“Hardly.”\n“You brought her to the safehouse!”\n“She forced me.”\n“No one forces you to do anything,” Codenames said, then bounced\nover and thrust her free hand toward Marasi. “Hi! I’m Codenames Are\nStupid. Long story.”\nThe woman had a faint accent, wholly unlike that of Allik or anyone\nMarasi had met from the Southern Continent. That, plus the way she’d\nspoken of “locals,” indicated … another traveler? The presence of an accent\nindicated she might not be as good at languages as Moonlight was, maybe?\nMarasi shook her hand. “Is … um … the Survivor here?”\n“Kell?” Codenames said. “Nah. Haven’t seen him in a week or so.” She\nspun toward Moonlight. “What do you think of the report? Worrisome,\nright?”\nMoonlight held the paper pinched between two fingers. “Codenames,”\nshe said, “what language is this even in?”\n“Thaylen,” Codenames said. “Oh! It’s a fascinating one, Moonlight. You\nshould learn it! Look how the letters interlock in—”\n“I’ll stick to using Connection tricks for languages, thank you,”\nMoonlight said, spreading out the rubbings she’d taken.\n“That’s cheating.”\n“Another word for a clever shortcut,” Moonlight said. “Is TwinSoul\nhere? I think we’re going to need some mathematics.”\n“Lily and I will go and grab him,” Codenames said, carrying her dog\nand slipping away into the back rooms.\nMarasi had watched the exchange with bafflement, but rather than focus\non what she didn’t understand, she turned her attention to something she"

One of the maps was of Scadrial—the entire world. A more detailed\nmap than she’d ever seen, far more extensive than the official surveys—it\neven included the dark parts of the unexplored islands and landmasses to\nthe south.\nIf that was Scadrial, then what were these other maps? Rusts. How\nmany worlds were out there?\nThere’s always another secret, she thought, remembering her catechism\nas a child studying the life of the Survivor.\nA short time later, Codenames walked back into the room with an\nelderly man. He looked … well, ancient, judging by the long powder-white\nmustache and the liver-spotted skin, which was a deep tan. He wore a\nformal suit in the Bilming fashion, so … maybe he was from her land? But\nhe also had a short beard with mustaches—a style she’d never seen a man\nwear in Elendel. Though he stood tall, not the least bit bowed by age, he did\nseem a little unsteady on his feet—since he gripped the doorframe as he\nstepped through it.\n“Ah,” he said, pressing his palms together. “A guest! Welcome to our\nhome, honored guest. Let me get you something to drink.”\n“TwinSoul,” Moonlight said, “we are on a deadline to—”\n“Deadlines are no excuse for rudeness,” TwinSoul said. “I am TwinSoul,\nand you are…?”\n“Marasi,” she said.\n“Lady Marasi!” he said. “Excellent.” He immediately turned toward\nwhat Marasi assumed was the kitchen. “How do you take your tea?”\n“Um … mint tea, if you have it. With lemon?”\n“Excellent!” he said again. He soon returned with a plate bearing a cup\nand an array of nuts and fruits. “Please enjoy.”\nShe felt guilty making someone so old wait on her—but at the same\ntime there was a certain forcefulness to how he offered the refreshment. It\nreminded her of her aunt, who would be far more offended if you didn’t\naccept a drink. So Marasi took the cup and a handful of nuts.\n“Now,” TwinSoul said. “What have you brought me, Moonlight?\nCurious, curious.” He stepped over to the table and surveyed the rubbings—\nstretching out his hands and resting them on the table.\nMarasi stepped up, curious. There was something odd about his hands\nthat she hadn’t noticed earlier: a line of crystal. Embedded in the skin,\nrunning along the outsides of his fingers and wrists—almost like a seam on\na glove. It was pinkish-red, like rose quartz. The man leaned down, and she\nsaw lines of similar crystal appear from beneath his collar, growing up the\nsides of his neck and temples. Crossing his skin like little rivers of liquid.\nAs she watched with amazement, these tendrils expanded from his\ntemples, forming spectacles. Completely made of crystal, the lens parts\nmore transparent than the rest. A second set of lenses, smaller, formed in\nfront of the others—giving him extra magnification."

A second set of lenses, smaller, formed in\nfront of the others—giving him extra magnification.\n“How…” Marasi said, glancing at Moonlight. “How does he do that?”\n“I fear,” TwinSoul said, pulling tight one of the rubbings, “that such\ninformation is not lightly shared with an outsider, even an honored guest. I\nmust trust that Moonlight thinks this is acceptable for you to see, but I\napologize. I will not explain without leave from our leader.”\n“It’s an emergency,” Moonlight said, lounging against a bookshelf with\nher arms folded. “I had to risk bringing her in.” She glanced at Marasi, and\nseemed to be hiding a smile at Marasi’s visible wonder.\nShe’s not as worried about my visit as she implied, Marasi thought. She\nsees this as an opportunity to intrigue me.\nIt was working. TwinSoul arranged the various rubbings, then raised an\nindex finger. Two lines of crystal grew up the outsides of that finger and\nformed into a nib, like a fountain pen. He absently unscrewed a small jar of\nink, then began taking notes.\n“What is the emergency, Moonlight?” he asked.\n“Autonomy is moving on a much faster timetable than we believed,” she\nexplained. “One of these charts lists explosions—once assumed to be due to\nrailway construction. We’re hoping you could correlate that with the\nhotspots of enemy activity we’ve been monitoring, to find a likely entry\npoint to the caverns.”\n“Ah yes,” TwinSoul said. “Silajana says he would be happy to aid in\nthis. Kaise, would you fetch the appropriate binder?”\n“Sure thing,” Codenames said, bounding off to do as she was asked.\nWith Marasi’s help, Moonlight pulled over a long table and arranged some\nof the rubbings on it. They left the circular table at the center of the room\nempty for now, though Marasi couldn’t guess why.\nAs TwinSoul took notes, he absently created a cup from the same rose-\ncolored stone, then filled it from a water jug at the side of the room. When\nhe was finished drinking, he set the cup on a plate—and the stone\ndisintegrated into fine powder, which then eventually vanished. A short time\nlater, he made a thin knife blade on one finger and cut out a specific section\nof the rubbing.\nWhen Codenames returned a short time later, TwinSoul was settled at\nthe table—on a crystal chair he had created. Marasi fidgeted and checked\nthe wall clock. They’d spent almost half an hour here so far. She didn’t\nknow how tight their deadline was, but given what they’d discovered,\nwaiting was unnerving.\n“Hmmm…” TwinSoul said, scribbling some more notes with his finger\npen. As he wrote, a line of crystal grew off his other hand and reached the\ncut-out section of the rubbing. There it formed a little frame around the\nflimsy square of paper. A pole grew up behind it, hanging it like a picture\nfor better inspection.\nTwinSoul peered at it through his improvised spectacles, playing with\nhis long mustaches."

He\nstood and walked away from the little workstation, leaving the framed piece\nof paper behind—and this time the stone didn’t disintegrate. He filled\nhimself a much larger cup of water, then stepped up to the circular table and\nrested one hand on it while drinking.\nA crystal city grew up from the table.\nIt started at his hand, then spread out—like frost forming on steel. His\ncrystal reminded Marasi of a darker version of the pink saltstone Steris had\nonce purchased for decorating the kitchen. Buildings sprouted from it,\nstreets formed as troughs—in minutes a complete replica of the city\nadorned the table, the circular elevated train tracks of the partially finished\nhigh-speed rail growing in last of all.\nMarasi’s breath caught, then she looked at the old man, who was smiling\nin a self-satisfied way. He appeared to enjoy the showmanship. Perhaps if\nshe hadn’t been here, he’d have pulled out a mundane map. But this was oh\nso much more impressive.\n“It’s called an aether,” Moonlight said, walking up behind her. “An\nancient entity predating the creation of your world. TwinSoul can grow it,\nmanipulate it. Would you like to know more?”\n“Yes,” Marasi whispered.\nMoonlight smiled. “And you shall. Once you join us.”\nMarasi breathed out softly, then reached out to touch the tip of one of\nthe buildings—which felt solid beneath her fingers, more sturdy than she’d\nexpected. The aether was mostly smooth, with tiny pits here and there.\n“I have three likely options for you,” TwinSoul said. “I’ve marked them\nin deeper-colored roseite.”\nHe pointed toward one building, a little pointer stick—the kind\nprofessors used for gesturing at chalkboards—growing between his fingers.\nThe building indicated was indeed a deeper red. It was the central spire of\nthe city, right at the heart of Bilming, rising high above the surrounding\nstructures. Straight along the sides, then tapering sharply toward the\nunfinished upper floors.\n“Independence Tower,” TwinSoul said. “This is no surprise—we’ve\nknown that the agents of Autonomy have been using this as their base for\nyears.”\n“And there were explosions underneath?” Marasi asked.\n“The detonations happened farther to the east,” TwinSoul said. “But I\ndoubt that the entrance to those caverns will be right in the center of the\ndetonations, for obvious reasons. Independence Tower is a central hub of\nactivity for our esteemed antagonists, and I’d bet it has an entrance to the\ncaverns.”\n“But it will be heavily guarded,” Marasi said. “What are the other two\noptions?”\n“This office building here, my lady,” he said, pointing to a smaller\nstructure in the city grid.\nShe nodded. “Note, though, I’m not a lady. I work for a living.”"

I work for a living.”\n“It is merely a distinction of respect, Lady Marasi,” he said. “From\namong my people. It … translates oddly into your language. Regardless,\nthis office building—the Dulouis Building—is both a hotbed of Set activity\nand at the perimeter of one of the locations with tremors. I consider it the\nmost likely option.”\nHe pointed back at the tall structure. “As you noted, Independence\nTower is highly defended—a veritable fortification, a castle in the middle of\nthe city. Breaching it has proven beyond even the arts of the Survivor\nhimself.”\n“Not for lack of trying,” Codenames added. “Their security system can\nspot ghosts. He hasn’t figured out a way to circumvent that.”\n“And the final location?” Marasi asked.\n“It seems of less import,” TwinSoul said, pointing at a structure on the\nperimeter of the city, beneath a section of train track. “An old tire factory.”\n“Tires?” Moonlight said, stepping up beside Marasi. “Like where Tobal\nCopper worked?”\n“TwinSoul, would I be correct to assume that factory is owned by Basin\nTires?” Marasi asked.\n“Indeed,” TwinSoul said. “You appear to have information beyond\nmine, my lady.”\n“That company is involved,” Marasi said. “Did your agents notice\nanything odd about the factory?”\nCodenames flipped through one of their files. “Uh … let’s see …\nCurious. The woman we had watching this location says it’s mostly shut\ndown, because very little is ever shipped out of it.”\n“But things are shipped in?” Marasi said, growing excited. “Maybe an\noddly large number of deliveries, given that the factory barely seems to be\ndoing anything?”\n“Yes,” Codenames said. “Our agent didn’t put that together, but yes.\nFrom the shipping manifests here … Why are they taking in so much, if\nthey’re not making anything?”\n“Because those aren’t supplies for the factory,” Moonlight said, meeting\nMarasi’s eyes. “They’re stockpiles of food and arms for the cavern\nunderneath. This is our incursion point.”\n“I agree,” Marasi said. “There has to be an entrance to the caverns there,\nand maybe it will be less guarded than the central spire. We strike here.”\n“We can get there quickly by rail,” Moonlight said. “The section leading\nfrom here to there is finished and running.”\n“Wait,” TwinSoul said. “How urgent is this threat?”\n“We have reason to believe,” Marasi said, “that the Set has developed a\nbomb capable of wiping out Elendel. Harmony is blinded, and we know the\nSet have been developing a device capable of delivering their bomb from a\ngreat distance.”\n“They have a dark god breathing down their necks,” Moonlight added.\n“Demanding results. They were supposed to put their plan into motion\nweeks ago. And with Marasi and her friends getting close … well, they\nhave every incentive to launch that bomb the moment they can.

She didn’t understand the strange words.\n“Was that … some kind of spell?” she whispered to Moonlight.\n“He said he was pleased to meet you,” Codenames said. “And\ncomplimented your hair.”\n“Oh,” Marasi said, transfixed by the glowing orb. Nothing held it up; it\nsimply floated, shimmering with a pure white glow, tinged with mother-of-\npearl.\nCodenames spoke to the sphere in the same language, and it bobbed\nagain, then began to shift and change. It melded into the shape of a person’s\nhead—a man with strong, angular features. She was shocked to find that\nmost of the paintings and statues of the Survivor were accurate. Except for\nthe spike through his right eye—a feature that was replicated in the light,\nsame as the rest of his head and hair.\n“I’m not surprised to hear from you,” he said. “Something’s wrong, isn’t\nit?”\n“Maybe?” Codenames said. “Honestly, we’re not certain, Kell. But\nTwinSoul said we should contact you.”\n“Is he there?” Kelsier asked.\n“Present, my lord,” TwinSoul said, bowing his head to the reproduction\nof the man’s face—though Kelsier didn’t seem to be able to see him. “Also\npresent is Moonlight, and … a visitor. One Marasi Colms.”\nThe Survivor’s image cocked an eyebrow at that. “Marasi Colms. We’ve\nbeen watching you.”\nMarasi stammered. This man was the center of her religion—she’d\nprayed to him as a child. And while she wasn’t as observant as Steris, it was\nstill … daunting to meet him.\nHe didn’t express anger that she was there. Another indication that\nMoonlight had been playing up that aspect, perhaps to make Marasi feel she\nwas getting away with something.\n“Report?” Kelsier asked.\n“Dawnshot is in Bilming,” Moonlight said, “and thinks the Set is\nmoving soon. Within the day.”\n“Harmony is blinded, Lord Survivor,” Marasi said, piping up. “He\nadmitted it to Wax. He can’t see anything, but … sir … he’s frightened.”\n“Damn,” Kelsier said. “I’m twelve hours away, moving quickly via\nairship.”\n“That … may not be soon enough, Kell,” Moonlight said."

It appears that the Set has discovered the relationship between\nharmonium and trellium. Beyond that, they’ve been experimenting with\nlong-range delivery devices. They’re prepared to do something stupid.”\n“Not so much stupid as desperate,” Kelsier said. “They know that\nAutonomy has declared this entire planet anathema. The Set is fighting for\nsurvival the only way they know how: by trying to destroy Elendel, to\nprove to Autonomy they can rule the planet. I thought we had more time\nthough. Why now?”\n“No idea,” Moonlight said. “But there’s talk of a new ashfall. I’ve never\nheard that before. Plus, we have a photo here of a destroyed city. Maybe …\nthey tried it out somewhere else, and photographed the results? At any rate,\nit implies something more than bombing Elendel.”\n“There have always been two plans,” Codenames said. “Autonomy\nwants to do something catastrophic to the entire planet—the ashfalls could\nbe their plan for that. But the Set is hoping to prove it can dominate the\nBasin, and that the more extreme measure isn’t needed. Like cutting off a\nfinger to prevent the infection from spreading.”\nThe room fell silent, Marasi feeling overwhelmed. They spoke of the\nend of a planet, her planet, as if it were something that they’d known was a\npossibility for some time. But then again, she was literally in a conversation\nwith the Survivor … so …\n“Sir,” she said. “Um, Lord Kelsier? I believe they are close to launching\nthis bomb. I intend to stop them, but I’m just one woman. I wouldn’t mind\nhelp. Anything you can offer.”\n“I don’t have the luxury of holding back,” Kelsier said more softly. “I\nshouldn’t have left for the South.

Miss Colms, you have our help.\nCodenames, how many full Ghostblood agents do we have in Bilming?”\n“Um…” Codenames said. “Only us three. Everyone else is in Elendel or\non assignment elsewhere in the field.”\n“How quickly can we get the Elendel agents to Bilming?” Kelsier asked.\n“Not quickly enough,” Moonlight said. “They’re all embedded, so we’d\nhave to use dead drops. We could have them roused by early evening,\nmaybe late afternoon, but they would still be several hours away in\nElendel.”\n“Send them to my sister,” Marasi said. “She’s trying to facilitate an\nevacuation via the Elendel government.”\nKelsier sniffed softly. He didn’t seem to have much respect for the\nElendel government. “Codenames, you take Dae-oh and see to it. I doubt\nthe field team needs a philologist for this mission. Also alert our members\naround the Basin. Shri Prasanva, I hate to pull you from your quiet evenings\nof scholarship, but I fear we’re going to need your help.”"

        "text": "around the Basin. Shri Prasanva, I hate to pull you from your quiet evenings\nof scholarship, but I fear we’re going to need your help.”\nThe elderly TwinSoul stood up straight, then bowed to the floating head.\n“We are eager to serve, my lord. Silajana sends his regards, and wishes he\ncould send more of his aetherbound to aid in your fight.”\n“I appreciate the sentiment,” Kelsier said. “You and Moonlight are to\nassist Miss Colms. In fact, I think it is time to do something drastic. Take\nthe stores of purified Dor. The Command is ‘Respect.’ Authorize the other\ncells to access theirs as well, and pass the Command to them.”\nCodenames gasped. Marasi had no idea what purified Dor was, but even\nMoonlight seemed impressed.\n“Do what you can,” Kelsier said. “I will try to accelerate my arrival, but\nthe truth is that I don’t know how much I can do. I’m traveling over water,\nand so can’t go much faster than I currently am. Dropping things to\nSteelpush off doesn’t do much with an ocean underneath you.”\n“We will stop this, my lord,” TwinSoul said. “Whatever is happening,\nwe will interrupt it. You shall arrive back in Elendel to find a pristine and\nwelcoming city.”\n“I’ll settle for the normal dirty, grouchy city, TwinSoul,” Kelsier said.\n“Go. I’ll see if I can shake Harmony out of his stupor. At least he sent\nDawnshot; that convinces me the threat is real. Anything that makes Saze\ntake action these days is to be considered significant.”\nThe face melted back into the sphere, and the communication was over.\nThe three immediately burst into motion, going in separate directions.\nMarasi decided to stick with Moonlight, who rushed to a different room—\nwhich required opening another mystical lock. Inside was an armory that\nwould have made Ranette delirious with glee. Guns on the walls, vials of\nmetals in racks, glass knives and dueling canes. A large chain-fed machine\ngun and some explosives.\nMoonlight ignored it all, rushing straight for a safe in the corner. It had\nno combination or locking mechanism that Marasi could see, though as she\npeered over Moonlight’s shoulder the woman put her hand on the front and\nsaid, “Respect me.” Some mechanism inside clicked, and the door opened.\n“Another … what was it … Identity lock?” Marasi asked.\n“No, this is even more secure,” Moonlight said. “It’s a lock that is\nAwake, and can tell from your Intent if you’ve been given a passcode or if\nyou’ve stolen it.”\nA lock … that was awake? As in alive?\nInside were only three items: a trio of identical glowing jars, big enough\nthat you’d have trouble carrying them in one hand. The glow was similar to\nthe sphere that had followed Codenames, but more intense. Each jar\noutshone the room’s electric lights.\nMoonlight took one, the light shining on her face, and turned it over.\nAwed.\n“What is it?” Marasi whispered.\n“Concentrated Investiture,” Moonlight said. “Unkeyed from any\nIdentity. This is an energy source that can power things like your Metallic\nArts.”"

This is an energy source that can power things like your Metallic\nArts.”\n“Those are powered by the gods.”\n“Exactly,” Moonlight said. “This power comes from a god’s corpse.\nTwo of them actually, intermingled. It’s exceptionally difficult to recover.\nThe things that you could do with this … well, that I could do with this.\nYou’d only be able to use it as a hyperefficient replacement for your metals.\nYou don’t know how good you have it here on Scadrial, being able to power\nyour abilities with something so common.”\n“And your abilities?” Marasi asked. “What are they powered by?”\nMoonlight smiled. She hadn’t admitted to any abilities, but so far Marasi\nhad seen a man who could create objects from crystal, a woman with a\npet … sphere … and Moonlight, who seemed fairly high in their\norganization. So what was she capable of doing?\nMoonlight packed the three jars in a rucksack, wrapped in some\ncushioning, then filled it with other supplies, including a few explosives.\nShe threw the sack over her shoulder and took a few guns from the wall.\nMarasi, with permission, helped herself to a fine-looking rifle—along with\nan innocent-looking case to carry it in—and some aluminum ammunition.\nThey had it in plenitude here.\n“Electrolysis,” Moonlight noted. “Aluminum is actually pretty easy to\nmake, once you know the process.”\n“Wait,” Marasi said, hurrying to join her as they left the room, “you can\nmake aluminum with electrolysis?”\n“Yeah,” Moonlight said. “We’ve been using it to fund our operations for\nalmost two decades now. I’d bet half the aluminum in the Basin came from\nus originally.”\n“And you’re casually letting me in on the secret?”\n“It’s a free sample,” Moonlight said. “Besides, Dean—he’s our chemist\nback in Elendel—is convinced you’ll find the secret soon, and the value will\nplummet. Dean thinks aluminum will soon be cheaper than tin.”\nCheaper than tin? Preservation! If every criminal could afford bullets to\nkill Allomancers, and every citizen could keep a band of aluminum in their\nhat to prevent emotional Allomancy, it …\nWell, it would change the world.\n“All of this,” Moonlight said, “is merely the surface, Marasi.”\n“Why me?” Marasi asked. “Why not Wax?”\n“He’s spoken for,” Moonlight said. “Besides, Kelsier prefers people like\nus. The discarded, the ignored. And Wax is a little … brazen. People watch\nhim. Track him. Pay attention to him. Not our style, for all that Kell likes to\nbe the center of attention.”\n“Plus, I suppose,” Marasi said with some thought, “having access to a\nhigh-ranking constable is useful.”\n“There’s also your uncommon connection to the Malwish,” Moonlight\nsaid.\n“Allik?” Marasi said, amused. “He’s wonderful—don’t get me wrong—\nbut I think you’d find him to be a little less … well-connected than you’re\nassuming.”"

She hoped he’d gotten out of the city. Her gut said that he would\ngo if she asked. There was a certain practicality to Allik that she loved—he\nwas wonderfully, beautifully genuine.\nIn her line of work, she met so many who made her question the nature\nof humanity. But then she’d go home and find all the reminders in the world\nof the best that people could be. And somehow, he was all hers.\nBack in the main room, the model of the city had started to crumble. It\ndidn’t disintegrate as quickly as the cup had; something made the stone\nlinger sometimes but immediately vanish other times. The chair, for\nexample, still seemed fully sturdy.\nMoonlight waved for Marasi to follow her out into the foyer. Here,\nTwinSoul walked down the steps, gripping the banister tightly for support,\nwearing a backpack that she thought—from the way it moved, and from the\nhose draped over his shoulder—might be filled entirely with water.\nHe’d changed outfits, and now wore some kind of loose-fitting uniform\nwith a bright yellow sash around his waist. He’d strapped on a sword—a\nslightly curved one in an ornate golden sheath. As he reached the ground\nfloor, he nodded to Moonlight. “Codenames is going to send some\nmessages,” he said, “and so can wait for that other woman you sent to reach\nsafety here. I think it is time for the three of us to be about the job. You\nretrieved the Dor?”\nMoonlight tapped her rucksack.\n“Excellent,” he said, turning to Marasi. “I have been commanded to\nfollow your lead, my lady. With Silajana’s blessing and yours, we strike\nforward. If there is danger, I vow that I shall fight to protect you.”\n“This … could be dangerous,” Marasi said, glancing at his ornate sword,\nnoting how unstable on his feet he was. “I’m sure we could use your help,\nTwinSoul, but … I don’t know that you should be doing any fighting.\nPerhaps we two could strike ahead, and call for you when we need your\nspecialized skills?”\n“I promise I will not slow you down, my lady,” he said. “I have been\ntasked with aiding you by the Survivor himself.”\nHe said it with calm respect, but his posture and attitude whispered\nsomething else. I’m going with you, young woman. Best not to argue the\npoint any further.\nRight, then. Marasi glanced at Moonlight, who nodded to her. Despite\ntheir knowledge and experience, this was Marasi’s mission. She was in\ncharge. Good.\n“Where’s the nearest train station?” she asked. “We need to get to that\nfactory as quickly as possible.”\n41\nIt was late afternoon by the time Wax got into position at the lord mayor’s\nmansion, the Silver House.

Not only did they seem to come less often\nthese days, he also had less occasion to go out at night. The mists felt like a\nfriend from his youth that he still knew but rarely talked to.\nHe’d been at this all day, having left Elendel a few hours before dawn,\nbut fatigue felt distant regardless. As four fifteen hit, Wax burst into motion.\nWayne should have his distraction going in full, which gave Wax the\nopportunity to bolt across the springy grass to the mayor’s mansion. He\ndropped a bullet and Pushed up to the second floor.\nThere, he grabbed the outer windowsill and gave a quick Push to the\nmechanism inside, which should undo the latch …\nThe window rattled, but didn’t unlatch. Drat. It had a full lock, one a\nPush couldn’t undo.\nAll right. He increased his weight manyfold, and a quick Push cracked\nthe window and bent the lock, letting him force the window open and pull\nhimself inside.\nHis boots thumped down on a carpeted floor. The place was messy, but\nnot cluttered. Piles of papers occupied the desk and the nearby tables. A\nsmall bar held a collection of spirits, half the tops off, the other half put\nhaphazardly back on the wrong bottle. Books lined a shelf, some put in\nspine first, others reversed, and a good third of them slumped to the side\nbecause the ones at the far end had been removed, leaving the whole thing\nto slouch like sleepy guards on watch duty.\nIt was in many ways the opposite of Copper’s flat. That had been sterile,\npristine. This was lived in. It had the air of a place full of secrets—because\na man as important as Gave would employ a fleet of maids and servants to\nkeep things tidy. Except in this room.\nWax didn’t have a lot to go on. But the lord mayor was involved in\nwhatever the Set was planning—and involvement on that level would leave\ntraces. A bomb somewhere in this city was pointed at Elendel, and this\nroom held the clues that would lead him to it. But where?\nWax sorted quickly through the pages on the desk. Wayne was probably\ndoing Grandma’s Been at the Vodka, his favorite ploy for drawing attention\nbut not gunfire. Unfortunately, the Set would be on the lookout for his\ntricks. They’d created a Metalborn designed specifically to face Wayne.\nThey would know about his propensity for disguises.\nThe papers didn’t give him much. Some shipping manifests to a factory\non the outskirts of town. A stack of broadsheets with editorials circled that\nwere critical of Gave. And another, newer stack of them with no such\nproblems. He opened the desk, and there found a curious number of letters\nfrom noblemen and noblewomen in Elendel.\nWax recognized several of the names, including Vennis Hasting—one of\nthe more powerful senators. He scanned a letter from him, and it touched on\nnothing incriminating. Though it mentioned trade negotiations, most of it\nwas pleasantries.\nFrowning, Wax fished in his coat pocket and brought out another letter,\nthe extremely incriminating one—also from Vennis Hasting—that Maraga"

He was missing pieces here. When had they moved from\npleasantries to discussing the destruction of the world?\nFor now, he stuffed both letters into his pocket. Gave and Vennis were\ncolluding, but he had already known that. He needed a lead on where to find\nthe bomb. Fortunately, after a little more hunting he struck gold. Gave\nEntrone’s calendar.\nPeople usually made certain to hide the most important documents and\ninformation. They’d lock up their plans and schemes, but often forgot\nsimple things like calendars. To a trained detective, knowing where you’d\nbeen—and where you planned to be—could be incriminating. Back in the\nRoughs, he’d often had to piece a person’s schedule together through\ninterviews and interrogations. But in a modern city, people tended to write\nit down for him.\nThe desk calendar was the wide and flat type that displayed an entire\nmonth, one day to a box. Previous months had been folded back behind,\nand were covered in notations in two hands: A sloppier one that, from the\nletters, Wax assumed was Gave’s. And a neater hand that likely belonged to\na secretary.\nLots of visits to something called the lab, Wax thought. With tight\nscheduling between meetings here at the mansion. So the lab is close, or he\nhas some direct method of getting to it …\nAnother spot listed trajectory and distance tests, and that was\nsurrounded by several empty days. So he’d needed to travel some way for\nthat. Curious. Where could they have launched delivery devices a long\ndistance without drawing attention?\nWax looked up as he heard some muffled shouts. Wayne’s distraction\nwas working. He kept searching, scanning for anything suspicious, and\nsomething struck him a moment later.\nThere were no appointments after today.\nA coldness spread through Wax as he looked at the last appointment, in\nGave’s own hand. It simply said, They arrive. Rusts. What did that mean?\nThere wasn’t the time for analysis, so he ripped off the sheets—even\nthough that would reveal he’d been here—and moved on. Confident he’d\nlearned what he could from the desk, he tried an old Coinshot’s trick:\nburning steel.\nLittle blue lines spread from his chest toward viable sources of metal.\nMost of these were faint, indicating nails in the walls and furniture. Light\nfixtures, doorknobs, even unseen wires for electricity. More and more, their\nlives were surrounded by metal—glints of it facilitating everything from the\nincandescent bulb to the nib in the pen on the desk. He knew some people\nfelt that the day of the Metalborn was over, that modern advances would\nequalize all people and diminish the advantages of Allomancer and\nFeruchemist.\nYet he had trained himself—with practice—to put out the lights in a\nroom by distorting the wires in the walls. His versatility improved with each\nnew discovery. And as more metal outlined their lives, he was able to see\nmore and more details of rooms.\nHe spotted no hidden chambers in the desk, but he did locate the room’s\nsafe.

Hidden not behind a picture or a bookshelf, but in the floor under a\ncouch—which was a more common spot than the other two, despite popular\nlore.\nWax set to it quickly. For all his levity, Wayne would be in serious\ndanger during this distraction. Wax didn’t want to leave him too long—\nindeed, Wax heard more cries and shouts as he shoved the couch aside.\nThey were getting louder. The enemy might already be on to him.\nThe safe had an Allomantic lock. No visible keyhole or combination. It\nwould be opened with Pushes if he was lucky, Pulls if he was unlucky. Wax\nsquinted, judging the metal lines. There was the giant blue one leading to\nthe safe itself, of course. Many Allomancers would stop with that, never\nrealizing that if you peered closer—if you let the lines start to drift and\nseparate …\nOne giant line became many smaller ones, all connecting him to the\nvarious mechanisms inside. Pins you could Push in a specific order to\nunlock the thing. He got to work as the shouts outside grew more urgent.\nThese kinds of locks were secure against most people, and even most\nAllomancers. But there was a weakness. Wax carefully, subtly Pushed each\npin in turn, wiggling them until he found the one that activated a tumbler.\nThat would be the first. He nudged it and was rewarded when it locked\ninto place. He was in luck—this was a mechanism meant for one who could\nPush, not Pull. He should be able to open it, though even many Coinshots\nwould have trouble with something this subtle.\nFirst tumbler in place, he wiggled each remaining pin to find the second.\nEasy. He quickly located the third, Pushed it, and—\nAnd the lock reset.\nWax froze, a bead of sweat trickling down his cheek. What had he done\nwrong? He forced himself, despite the growing noise outside, to go through\nit again. Again, the lock reset after he Pushed the third pin.\nHe pounded the floor in frustration until the answer struck him. This\nwasn’t a lock designed for someone who could Push or Pull. It was\ndesigned for someone who could do both. The third pin required a Pull.\nIn short, it was a lock designed for a Mistborn to open. Or in this case,\nsomeone using Hemalurgy to cheat.\nWhich meant he was out of luck. He’d never get this open, not unless he\ncould rip it out and do his Pushes from both sides … He didn’t have time\nfor that. And there was something more going on outside. Shouts. Alarms,\nand …\nAnd was that smoke he smelled?\nRusts. Wax did a quick scan of the room for anything else he could\ninvestigate. There wasn’t …\nWait. That pattern of metal in the floor. Wooden boards in regular\nstraight rows, nailed down in lines. Except for one square of nails\nunderneath the rug.\nTrapdoor, he thought, and shoved the rug aside, feeling about until he\nlocated the hidden latch. Entrone had the spikes to make him an Allomancer\nand was quite enamored with his powers, judging by that safe. But he didn’t"

But he didn’t\nhave the experience of someone who’d grown up with their powers. A\nseasoned Coinshot could pick out that pattern of nails in the same way a\nsquare of new paint on an old wall would stand out.\nThe trapdoor led to a very narrow shaft with a wooden ladder. Probably\nbetween two walls on the first floor, down into a basement.\nAs smoke began to stream in around the door and he heard shouts for a\nfire brigade—along with feet thumping along the hallway outside—Wax\ndecided to abandon the safe. He slipped onto the ladder, then pulled the\ntrapdoor closed behind him. Hoping that wherever this led, it would point\nhim in the right direction.\n42\nIt was odd for Marasi to feel such urgency while sitting and waiting.\nThe elevated train of Bilming lived up to its reputation. The group of\nthem sat in a private compartment, speeding around the city, bypassing\ntraffic congestion. The train stopped frequently, but each time it did, it\nbolted back into motion with a jarring acceleration.\nIt felt almost like she was a Coinshot, each burst of speed from the train\na fresh Push launching them ever closer to their destination. She’d read of\nthe Ascendant Warrior’s Flight of Destiny in the Words of Founding, when\nshe’d returned to Luthadel at the last minute to save Harmony. In the\nstories, Vin had traveled a miraculous distance in mere hours.\nNow, Marasi likely traveled at that same speed. In cushioned comfort,\nwith a cool breeze piped in from outside. They carried weapons hidden in\ncases or sacks, and Marasi still wore the simple trousers and shirt she’d\ndonned for her sting. Moonlight was dressed as a Bilming constable, and\nTwinSoul had shrouded himself in a local fisherman’s raincloak. She’d\ninitially worried that his suit and colorful sash would stand out, but he\nclearly knew how to be inconspicuous.\n“For this to work,” Marasi said to them, “I need to understand our\nresources. That means, Moonlight, I really need to know what you’re\ncapable of.”\n“Art criticism,” she said. “Fighting, if needed. Wisecracks when\nappropriate.”\n“I meant any extraordinary abilities,” Marasi said.\n“Her wisecracks are extraordinary,” TwinSoul said, his eyes twinkling.\n“Why, they’re so remarkable that I quite often can’t see which part of them\nis supposed to be wise.”\nMoonlight, in turn, rolled her eyes. “I have three soulstamps on me at\nthe moment: two universal stamps, one Essence Mark. It takes time and\npreparation to create more—time we don’t have—so we’ll have to rely on\nthese ones. I can use each stamp multiple times, but no use will last long,\nsince they weren’t … Right, you have no idea what I’m talking about.”\n“Moonlight,” TwinSoul explained, “has stamps that rewrite the nature of\nthe objects she encounters. One makes a doorway appear where none\npreviously existed. The second repairs a broken or worn object, to make it\nlook new. Is that correct?”"

Is that correct?”\nMoonlight nodded. “It’s something I’m practicing still—stamps that will\nwork on any object, I mean. Requires Invested ink, on this planet, but we’ve\ngot the process mostly working.”\n“So you can make a door appear,” Marasi said. “And you can make an\nobject that was broken become new? How many times?”\n“As often as I want,” Moonlight said. “But only for a limited period in\neach case.”\n“Wow,” Marasi whispered. “That’s … magic?”\n“Is Allomancy magic?” Moonlight asked.\n“Of course not,” Marasi said.\n“Neither is this,” Moonlight said. “To repair something, I merely rewrite\nthe past, making the object think it was well-maintained or never broke.\nLike I said, universal stamps are a new technology. I don’t have them\nworking perfectly yet, but they’ll do for now.”\nIt felt magical to Marasi regardless. Allomancy was one thing—it made\nperfect sense to be able to use metal to Push on other pieces of metal. But\nrewriting the past of an object? How was that not magical?\n“You said you have three stamps,” Marasi said. “What’s the third?”\n“It’s for emergencies.” Moonlight shifted in her seat. “The other two\nwork on nonliving objects only. This one changes a person—me,\nspecifically—in dramatic ways. I avoid using it if possible.”\nMarasi glanced at TwinSoul, who shook his head in a “leave it alone”\nsort of way. Well, all right. She hated going into a potential fight without\nknowing what her options and advantages were, but at least she’d learned\nsomething.\nThe train slowed at a stop, causing them all to lean in their seats at the\nchange in momentum. People piled into the corridor between compartments\noutside, waiting to flood out into the station.\n“And you, TwinSoul?” Marasi asked. “Is there a limit to the things you\ncan make?”\n“Alas,” he said, nudging his backpack, which was on the floor, “there\nare indeed serious limits. I can only maintain roseite objects under certain\nfields of Investiture. Some planets have those naturally, but yours does not,\nso my roseite creations—outside of our safehouse—must be touching me,\nor they will disintegrate. It also requires water, drawn from my body, to fuel\nthe creations.\n“Beyond that, my ability to form objects is limited by my personal skill\nand understanding. I cannot make you a gun, for example. The mechanics\nare beyond this old mind, and the intricacies too fine. Simple tools are the\nextent of my abilities, though Silajana has bonded some more talented than\nI in that regard.”\n“Sil-ah-janah,” Marasi said, trying to form the unfamiliar sounds. “That\nis your … god?”\n“Both less and more than a god,” he explained. “Silajana is one of the\nprimal aethers. They predate Adonalsium, you know, and exist outside of\nhis power.”\n“They predate the Shattering,” Moonlight said. “That doesn’t mean they\npredate Adonalsium.”"

She could see the bones inside, and it seemed the crystal had\nsomehow entirely replaced his flesh and muscles in that spot.\n“This bud connects me to Silajana,” he continued, “and through him to\nall of his other aetherbound. He is the core, and we his web. He is eternal,\nand we his mortal agents in the cosmere.”\nThat was … a lot to take in. But Marasi supposed that all that mattered\nwas that he was willing to help. “Thank you for joining our fight,” she said.\n“I’m glad that Silajana could spare you.”\n“There is little else for us now,” he said, looking out the window. “Until\nwe can return home…”\n“I’m willing to go with you, Pras,” Moonlight said. “If you want to try.”\n“The forces in my homeland are too strong, too deadly,” he said.\n“Silajana says we must remain in exile. He will decide when and if we are\nto return. He would not risk another extermination.”\nThe train bolted forward again, causing them all to lean the other\ndirection in their seats. Only three more stops until they arrived.\n“Moonlight, can your door stamp help us get into the enemy base?”\nMarasi asked.\n“It will depend on the building materials,” she said. “This stamp\npretends the people who constructed the place installed a door. It’ll be touch\nand go for it to work on things like natural rock.”\n“Then we can sneak into the factory from any direction,” Marasi said,\n“and then find the way down into the caverns.”\n“They’ve been moving a lot of supplies,” Moonlight said. “Large crates\nof equipment and food. So I doubt we’re looking for some hidden\nstairwell.”\n“You’re right,” Marasi agreed. “There will likely be a freight elevator in\nthe main loading bay. Good assumption.”\n“We could attempt,” TwinSoul said, “to pretend to be members of their\norganization, making a delivery. Perhaps we could hijack a supply truck on\nthe way?”\n“Tried that,” Marasi said. “It was kind of a mess. I’d rather be more\nstealthy.”\n“I agree,” Moonlight said. “I suggest we scout the location, find an\nempty room at the rear, and create a door. They’ll have their security\nfocused on entry points, which we can avoid. From there we make our way\nto the cargo docks and locate the elevator.”\nA reasonable enough plan. Though Marasi’s anxiety increased the closer\nthey came to their destination. Soon the train lurched to a stop, and the three\nof them piled off. She worried the long case she was carrying—with her\nborrowed rifle hidden inside—would draw attention, but no one gave her so\nmuch as a second glance. Perhaps they thought it was some kind of musical\ninstrument. More likely, they didn’t care."

More likely, they didn’t care.\nNeither of Marasi’s companions were of a Scadrian ethnicity, but\nMoonlight kept a hat on to shade her eyes. She was shorter than most from\nMarasi’s world, but there was no telling if that was a trait of her people, or\nan individual body shape. TwinSoul, in contrast, was tall and lanky. His\ndarker skin tone stood out on the street, but most would just assume he had\nTerris blood—that people’s colorations varied far more than those of people\nwith old Central Dominance heritage, like Marasi.\nPlus, there was a lot of variety in dress in this city. People seemed to\neschew the dark browns and blacks that were more common in Elendel.\nVibrant colors, often clashing, were part of the style here. With other\noddities too. In the train station alone, they passed a costumed mascot\ntrying to hand out flyers for a furniture store, a couple of masked Malwish\ntourists, and a koloss-blooded woman in a suit.\nOutside the station, atop the platform with steps leading to the streets\nbelow, they spotted their target in the near distance: an old brown-brick\nfactory with a mottled sign out front. Even this futuristic city had less-\ndesirable sections of town; many were hidden away beneath the tracks.\nMarasi had hoped to find the building quiet, since the Ghostblood spy’s\nrecords had indicated infrequent supply drops in recent weeks. Today,\nunfortunately, the building was buzzing with activity—some half a dozen\ntrucks loading up and pulling out through a large bay door at the side of the\nstructure.\n“Well,” Moonlight said, “little doubt where the loading bay is. We’ll\nprobably find the elevator in there.”\n“Inside the bay,” TwinSoul said, “that is currently full of enemy forces?”\n“Yeah…”\n“What if,” Marasi said, “we came into the elevator from the back? You\ncan make a door in any wall, right? What if we made one into the elevator\nfrom behind?”\n“That’s possible,” Moonlight said. “Though I’m not comfortable with\nhow busy it looks. We were hoping to slip in during a quiet moment.”\nMarasi agreed—though as she considered it, she realized that had been\nnaive of them. The Set knew that they were in Bilming and actively trying\nto stop them …\nMarasi hesitated as she watched several of the trucks roar away from the\nfactory, heading toward the hill with the government offices. Then she\nfound herself smiling.\n“They’re worried about Wax,” she said. “They’re marshalling troops,\ngathering resources … I’ll bet they’re sending it all to deal with him.”\n“Maybe,” Moonlight said.\n“Trust me,” Marasi said. “Where Wax goes, fireworks follow. The Set is\nworried about him—and they likely know exactly where he is. Flying\nthrough the air does tend to make him conspicuous.”\n“If you’re correct, my lady,” TwinSoul said, “then they might not be\nexpecting our incursion here.

Their eyes may be diverted toward\nDawnshot.” More trucks pulled away, and TwinSoul pointed toward the\nnorthern side of the city, where a giant plume of dark smoke was rising.\n“That’s the mayor’s mansion. Perhaps Dawnshot is being … extra\ndifficult?”\n“I’ll take it,” Marasi said, leading the way down the steps. “Let’s strike\nwhile everyone is distracted.”\n43\nEveryone in the room—including the kandra—gathered around Steris to\nread the letter Wax had sent. Perhaps they didn’t trust her to deliver the\ninformation out loud, or perhaps they needed to see it with their own eyes.\nBomb is confirmed real, and already fabricated. City-destroying\ncapacity. Enemy is trying to find a way to deliver it to Elendel. It’s\ntime to evacuate the city.\nThey know I’m after them. I hope that my presence won’t cause\nthem to do anything rash. Investigation suggests attempts to deliver\nby train or road failed and they seek alternative, perhaps some kind\nof self-propelled artillery shell. Regardless, I suggest you close off\nall routes into Elendel as a precaution.\nThere is conflict among the Set. Some want to destroy Elendel,\nothers maybe the entire Basin by restarting the Ashmounts, judging\nby a strange photograph we’ve found. I may be able to exploit the\nschism between them. Either way, my primary objective is\nneutralizing the bomb’s delivery mechanism.\nGet as many people out as you can, as quickly as possible, in\ncase I fail.\nI love you.\nWaxillium\nAdawathwyn immediately ordered the young radio operator sequestered\n—along with anyone who might have heard the communication. Everyone\nelse in the room slumped into chairs at the table, and several looked to\nTenSoon.\n“We should believe Dawnshot,” he said. “Harmony has long thought the\nenemy was working on something like this. The deadline is … far more\nurgent than we realized. Rusts. We need to take this very seriously.”\n“I am forced to agree,” Adawathwyn—of all people—said. “I don’t\nmuch like Ladrian, but … this news, with a kandra confirming it … My lord\ngovernor, it seems we have a gun to our heads.”\nThe governor leaned forward on the table, grim.\nFinally, Steris thought, releasing a held breath. They are giving this the\nattention it deserves. Maybe now she could get something done.\n“Time is of the essence,” the governor said, looking around the table at\nthe three senators and his vice governor. “If there really is a bomb … we\nhave to move fast.”\n“Agreed,” Lord Cett said. “How quickly can we get out of the city?”\n“That depends,” the governor said. “Ambassador Daal? Can I take that\nairship ride now?”\n“So long as the streets aren’t packed,” Adawathwyn said, “we can\ntheoretically be out of the city via motorcade in under an hour.”\n“Will that be quickly enough?” Lady Hammondess said. “What is the\ndestructive radius of this weapon, kandra? How far away do we have to get\nto be safe?”\n“I’ll send for our families,” the governor said. “We have to do this\nquietly though, to not inspire a mass panic.”"

        "text": "to be safe?”\n“I’ll send for our families,” the governor said. “We have to do this\nquietly though, to not inspire a mass panic.”\nSteris closed her eyes, feeling sick. On one hand, she understood their\nemotions. After all, she had sent her children away immediately.\nAt the same time … Rusts. They were all going to run, weren’t they?\nShe met Constable Reddi’s eyes. He’d slumped in his chair, looking numb.\nSworn to protect the people of the city, and there was nothing he could do.\nNothing but sit here and dread what was coming.\nShe didn’t have to do that. She’d dreaded it already. That was the\npurpose of her lists. She realized, with shock, that her method was actually\nworking. She didn’t feel afraid. She didn’t feel anxious.\nShe could function.\nShe had to evacuate the city.\nSteris pulled out one of her thickest notebooks, thumping it down on the\ntable. As everyone else started calling for aides to prepare their escapes, she\ngathered her thoughts and flipped through her notes. She had seven detailed\nevacuation plans for the city. Which was best in this situation?\nAfter a few minutes though, the governor ordered the door shut again\nand all aides temporarily expelled. The room’s anxious occupants turned\ntoward him.\n“Um,” he said, “Adawathwyn has a suggestion.”\nShe had composed herself quickly and now stood up in her immaculate\nTerris robes, hands out invitingly. “The situation is indeed dire. But I have\nrealized we have a solution … upon our arms, so to speak. Lord Waxillium\nsays that there is likely some kind of device that will launch the bomb all\nthe way to our city. But we have Metalborn at our disposal. The greatest\nwealth of them in all the Basin.\n“We should gather Coinshots and station them to Push this weapon\naway. We can position them atop our highest structures, to watch for the\nweapon’s arrival—or, better, keep people on call in Bilming, watching.\nThey’ll be able to tell us when it has launched.”\n“Pardon me, Adawathwyn,” Steris said. “Have you ever been in a\nsituation where modern weapons fire is discharged? Have you seen the\nspeed at which it moves? Trust me. If this weapon is launched, when it\nreaches Elendel, it will impact too quickly for an Allomancer to stop.”\nThe vice governor wilted for a second, then her eyes widened. “What\nif,” she said, “we had an Allomancer with access to all the abilities and\npowers of the Lord Ruler?”\nSeveral in the room gasped. Daal stood up straight, his masked eyes\nfixated on Adawathwyn.\n“It’s an emergency,” she said. “A true emergency. The entire city is in\ndanger! We need someone who can think the thoughts of a thousand people,\nsomeone who can move planets and raise mountains. We need … the Bands\nof Mourning.”\nBother.\nFirst off, the Bands didn’t work that way. They gave a person\nsupercharged metallic abilities—yes—but they didn’t contain “all the\npowers of the Lord Ruler.” Unfortunately, the mythology surrounding them\nand Wax’s use of them had only grown over the years.\nThat said, Steris had considered using the Bands—they often factored"

        "text": "powers of the Lord Ruler.” Unfortunately, the mythology surrounding them\nand Wax’s use of them had only grown over the years.\nThat said, Steris had considered using the Bands—they often factored\ninto her calculations. A powerful relic created by the Survivor—or maybe\nthe Lord Ruler—which granted vast Metalborn powers to the holder wasn’t\nthe sort of thing one ignored.\n“We can’t use the Bands,” Steris said. “The people of Elendel made a\npromise. The foundation of a treaty.”\nBehind them, Admiral Daal—so quiet through most of the meeting—\napproached the table. “The Bands of Mourning,” he said, “were entrusted to\nthe Faceless Immortals, under the strict understanding that the Bands would\nnever be employed by your people.”\nTechnically, the Bands weren’t to be employed unless the Malwish\nattacked Elendel. That had been the actual deal, a way of making certain\nthat Malwish aggression didn’t go too far.\n“Surely, Ambassador,” Adawathwyn said, “you can see our need for\nself-preservation. You wouldn’t deny us the means, in this dire emergency,\nto protect ourselves from this calamity?”\n“Surely,” Ambassador Daal said, “you understand that any action by\nthose in the Basin using this sacred relic—however dire the situation—must\nbe seen as an act of aggression against my people. You don’t think we’ve\nsuffered catastrophes that we wish we could have used the Bands to stop?\nWe could have been using them to save lives these past six years! But our\nagreement was that they were too powerful for anyone to use.”\nThe room fell silent. He’s playing some kind of game here, Steris\nthought. She couldn’t fathom what.\n“We…” the governor said, licking his lips. “We should fetch them. If an\nAllomancer with enhanced speed of thought could Push away this bomb\nbefore it lands, that gives us a chance.”\n“They don’t have as much power as you think,” Steris said. “They can’t\naccomplish that.”\n“Actually,” TenSoon said, “there’s a possibility.”\n“What?” Steris asked.\n“There are … things about the interactions of the powers you don’t\nknow,” he said. “I have only hints. I think it might be possible … to send\nthe bomb away using the Bands. But the deal we made…”\n“Holy One,” the governor said, “what would Harmony say, should it\ncome down to our survival as a city or betraying the Malwish trust. What\nare his wishes?”\nTenSoon stood quietly for a moment, then spoke with a growling voice.\n“I will fetch the Bands.”\nand leeched her steel reserves.\n“Give me the compass,” I said, “and we’ll leave you at the next\noutcropping.”\nVila peered over her shoulder at the approaching stone where the\nHaunted Man waited.\nShe glanced at me, her eyes wide, no doubt realizing that without any\nsteel, she couldn’t Coinshot away. She was trapped. In her surprise, she\nforgot to hold onto anything but the compass.\nI had not planned on that.\n“No!” I screamed, immediately dropping my parasol and reaching for\nVila. I serendipitously caught her by the lace of her frilly coat."

I serendipitously caught her by the lace of her frilly coat.\n“You saved me?” she asked. “Don’t you want me to fall?”\n“Harmony no,” I said.\nShe clocked me in the face with the compass, which honestly was a bad\nmove on her part. I instinctively let go of her.\nAs Vila fell, I keeled forward, trying to catch her again, but serendipity\nis a fickle thing, and my hand missed hers by a hair. Horrified, I watched the\nmists swallow her. The sudden shifting of my weight, however, threw me\nfrom the claw.\nSuddenly weightless, I feared this might be the end.\nThen I felt air pushed by large wings. A claw snatched me and dropped\nme on the outcropping next to the Haunted Man.\nI slid to a stop just shy of the edge, my custom Miele Jedon boots\nsending pebbles clacking over the side. Bless those shoes and their\nfashionable yet grippy soles. (You can get a pair at Ardenne’s on 9th.\nThey’re custom, yes, but drop my name, and the clerks there will be keen to\nhelp.)\nHeart thumping, my breath coming in gasps, I searched the top of the\noutcropping. “The compass…we should scour the cliffs!”\nTabaar-KeSun landed and opened their other claw. The compass rolled\nout, and I snatched it up. Before I could thank them, the Haunted Man took\nmy hand and stared at me with intense, desperate eyes. Given his usual\nscowl, this new expression was as foreign on him as cheap perfume would\nbe on me.\n“My dearest Nicelle,” he said, gifting me a rare smile.\n“What is it?” I asked, inspecting myself for wounds. Though I’d lost a\nfew buttons from my blouse, at least I hadn’t lost the whole shirt, which\nalways happened to Jak at this point in his stories. “I’m fine. I promise.”\n“You almost fell,” he said, cupping my cheek in one of his large, rough\nhands.\nHeat boiled up from my heart, and I couldn’t help but smile back. How\nfar we had come from our first meeting!\n“You silly man. You’ll never get rid of me that easily,” I said. “It’s you\nand me exploring the cosmere together forever. Just like we promised.”\nI let him pull me close, his familiar scent of hellfire and cedar filling me.\nWith the knuckle of his finger, he lifted my chin so that I looked into his\nstormy eyes.\nWas he going to kiss me? Did I want him to? By Harmony, yes. In that\nmoment, I realized I’d wanted this for the last six years, every time he’d\nappeared and (inevitably) upended my life.\n“Nicelle…” he said, his voice low and breathy.\n“Yes?” I rolled up onto my toes and leaned into him.\n“I am so very sorry.” He lifted the Compass of Spirits, inserted the\naluminum key, and turned it. The little rings spun until they flowed with\nethereal light, which inverted in on itself with a giant pop I felt in my soul\nmore than heard with my ears."

At the\nend of my fit, my immaculate makeup was smeared, my hat and its raven\nfeathers lay in tatters, and Tabaar and KeSun were suddenly there in their\nhuman forms.\n“He’s gone!” I shouted. “Along with the only way to finish the job, and\nnow we’re stuck a thousand miles from home in the space between\ncontinents!”\nI thought he’d cared for me. He knew a betrayal like this would hurt me,\nand he’d done it anyway. Rust and Ruin, I hope he arrived too late to save\nthe world.

It proved easy to sneak around\nunderneath the train tracks; the buildings down here in this urban twilight\nwere cramped, the streets narrow. Almost like the stories of the old\nLuthadel slums.\nCrowded tenements were crammed up beside factories, refineries, and\nwarehouses. All in the shadow of the tracks—a symbol of progress and\nunity upon which stormed past every few minutes a tooth-rattling reminder:\nWasn’t it so nice to live in such a modern city? With a beacon of\nadvancement like the high-speed rail? It cast such a progressive shadow.\nShe was all for progress in general, but far too often it seemed to stratify\nsociety rather than unite it.

The three of them crept ever closer to the tire\nfactory, using the back alleys. TwinSoul made good on his promise, keeping\nup—though they didn’t have to move quickly, and there was always a wall\nfor him to rest his hand against to keep his balance. Marasi still worried\nabout bringing an octogenarian to what might soon be a battle zone, but bit\nher tongue on the matter.\nAs they drew close—only one street away—Moonlight halted the group.\nMarasi was curious what had prompted the stop, until she noticed a bulbous\nblack motorcar with tinted windows pulling up to the factory.\nThe lord mayor of Bilming climbed out—accompanied by several\ntough-looking bodyguards. Entrone hurried through the bay doors, shouting\nat the few remaining trucks there and waving for them to get moving.\nMarasi was almost certain she heard the name “Dawnshot” among his\nshouts.\nHe soon vanished into the structure.\n“Well,” Marasi whispered, “he’s agitated.”\n“Probably doesn’t appreciate his home being burned down,” TwinSoul\nwhispered.\nMarasi nodded. “Come on. His arrival seems to confirm that we’ve\nfound the right location.”\nThey took the long way around, briefly dipping out of the shade cast by\nthe railway before diving back in, swimming through shadows until they\nreached the back wall of the factory. Here they slunk along until they found\nan old window, boarded up. Marasi had hoped to be able to peek through\nand find an empty room, but it was boarded up on the other side as well.\n“Hmmm,” TwinSoul said, resting his aged, bony hand on the bricks.\nCrystals grew from his palm, creeping along the surface and between\nboards. “Yes, they really should have sealed this with pitch…”\n“What do you see?” Moonlight whispered.\n“I don’t see anything,” he said. “But Silajana? Well, he senses a small\nroom cluttered with shelves and small objects. No one is inside, and the\nwall to the right of the window bears no shelving.”\nHe broke his hand free, leaving a crust of crystals on the wall—which\nbegan disintegrating, dropping to dust that in turn burned away into rose-\ncolored mist. Moonlight dug in her rucksack—briefly exposing the glowing\njars within—and took out something made of leather. Like a very large\nbillfold, or a toolbelt, it unclipped to reveal three stone stamps.\nShe selected one, dampened it with some odd glowing red ink, then\nraised it. “Be ready to move,” she said, then pressed it to the wall.

When\nMoonlight pulled it back—trailing red mist—it left a glowing red stamp\nimprinted into the wall, marked by intricate designs and patterns.\nThe wall then began to shift. The bricks groaned softly, then popped and\nground as they pulled to the sides—suddenly fluid—and a door emerged in\nthe wall. Like … like someone had unzipped the stones to reveal it\nunderneath. In seconds the structure had rearranged—many bricks simply\nvanishing—to create a worn old wooden door with peeling yellow paint.\nMoonlight yanked it open and gestured for them to enter. Marasi ducked\nin first, stepping over some buckets of paint that had been piled against the\nwall. TwinSoul followed, then finally Moonlight. They crowded into a small\nchamber, lit by a single red electric bulb. Why were there so many\nwashbasins on the counter, and all of these jugs of liquid? Was this a\nstorage room for cleaning supplies? That didn’t explain the red light bulb,\nwhich was so dim it barely did anything.\nBehind them, the doorway vanished—as if being consumed by the\nbricks on the sides. “That is the most unnatural thing I’ve ever seen,”\nMarasi whispered.\n“You literally have a friend who can fly,” Moonlight said.\n“And?” Marasi said, unzipping her rifle from its case. TwinSoul threw\noff his coat, exposing his suit and yellow sash, then rested a hand on his\nsword. Marasi listened at the door, and was joined by Moonlight. When\nthey heard nothing from the next room over, Marasi eased the door open\nand found a pitch-black chamber beyond.\nThey slipped through it, passing a strangely large number of what\nappeared to be chairs. Yes, in rows. What in the world? At the far reaches of\nthe room, Marasi fumbled in the darkness, searching for a door. Her hands\ninstead brushed what felt like a series of light switches.\nSince the room was clearly empty, she flipped one of the light switches.\nHowever, it wasn’t the kind of light she’d been anticipating. A streak of\nillumination burst from one wall and shone onto the other, projecting a\nbrilliant image.\nAn image of a crumbling city, with ash falling from the sky. Then the\nimage started moving.\n45\nMarasi stared at the moving image, depicting a city in full color—though\nthose colors were mostly muted dark greys and blacks against the brilliant\nred sky. Ash drifted from above, sprinkling the smoldering ruins. A loud\nmechanical sound came from the room emitting the light.\n“By the first aether,” TwinSoul said, stepping up beside her and resting\nhis hand on the back of a nearby chair for support. “What is it? A window\ninto the future?”\n“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Moonlight said from the far wall,\nnearest the image.

Those had been static, and in black and white. But he’d said\nsomething then that had stuck with her: Harmony implies that if we find this\nwondrous, it will really burn our metals when the images start moving.\nIt appeared the Set had figured out that secret. And they’d found a way\nto create moving images of another place, using cameras? This room did\nhave the feel of a small playhouse theater, only without the stage.\nBut … was this landscape of piling ash and broken cities the future, or\nthe past? It resembled Elendel, by the architecture, but there was so much\nrubble she couldn’t tell for certain.\n“Here, look at this,” Moonlight called from the far side of the room,\nwhere she’d opened another door.\nTwinSoul and Marasi joined Moonlight in a room with a different kind\nof decor. An enormous table dominated it, with a tiny replica of a city on it.\nIt was like the model that TwinSoul had created, but made out of painted\nwood and plaster—broken and ruined, the buildings fallen as if in some\ndisaster.\nIt was Elendel; she could see that from the layout. So, not only had\nsomeone seen the future, they’d built a model of what was going to happen?\nMoonlight peeked into some boxes, then pulled out a handful of fine ash\nfrom one, which she let trail through her fingers. Other shelves held tiny\nprops—miniature versions of people lying like corpses. Dead horses made\nof painted plaster. Broken buildings, ruined motorcars, some large red-\npainted sheets with depictions of clouds and a blazing sun …\nAnd evanotype cameras, set up to look across the table from down low.\nSeeing that, it all snapped together for her.\n“It’s a fake,” she whispered with relief. “They didn’t travel to the future\nor the past. They created a model of a fallen Elendel … then used these\nmachines to craft pictures of a future that hasn’t happened. Even that\npicture we found earlier … it’s a fake. A photo of this model. They’ve been\ndeliberately constructing a hoax to make people think the world is going to\nend.”\n“No,” Moonlight said. “They’ve been constructing a hoax to make\npeople think it has already ended. But who are they planning to show it to,\nand why?”\n“If there are answers,” Marasi said, “we’ll find them below.” She\nnodded the other direction, out through the theater room toward the larger\ndoors on the wall near the projecting device.\nThey peeked out to find a hallway lit with caged industrial lights. The\nplace felt eerily empty, considering the earlier activity. Moonlight went out\nfirst. Marasi joined her, and they found a set of doors at the end of the\nhallway. These doors had windows at the top, so they could observe the\nloading dock beyond.\nA group of armed men and women patrolled here. TwinSoul crouched\nbeside Marasi, then let a tiny—practically invisible—line of crystals sneak\nunder the door."

The elevator must be below, likely having carried\nthe lord mayor and his bodyguards into the depths.\nNow what?\n“Allow me,” TwinSoul said, stepping through the door and steadying\nhimself by grabbing a small box just inside, standing with one foot on a\nnarrow ledge, the other dangling over the void. Marasi reached to steady\nhim, but before she could the door vanished, the wall stretching back into\nplace.\nMoonlight hastily stamped again, then pulled open the door. They found\nTwinSoul hanging from a ladder constructed of roseite stone. He took a\nlong drink from his backpack full of water and smiled. “Shall we?” he\nasked.\n“What if someone calls the elevator back up?” Marasi asked.\n“It’s an industrial elevator,” Moonlight said. “Look how wide this shaft\nis, how thick the cables are. It will move slowly. Worst case, we can climb\non top and ride it up. There’s enough space above us here that we won’t be\ncrushed.”\nMarasi nodded, and TwinSoul began climbing down, new rungs forming\nbeneath him as he did so. Marasi stepped onto the ladder, testing its\nstrength. TwinSoul was, it turned out, exceptionally handy to have along.\nShe climbed down a little to let Moonlight on too. The doorway vanished\nagain, but Moonlight cracked open her rucksack to let some light leak out,\npainting the shaft with a pale white glow.\nThey started descending toward the caverns. And, hopefully, answers.\n46\nWax climbed down the hidden passage in the mayor’s mansion. Yes, it did\nseem to be squeezed between two walls; he’d climbed far enough to pass\nthe first floor and reach the basement. Here his ladder emerged into a small\nroom with iron walls and ceiling.\nIt had supplies on the shelves: dry rations, jugs of water. Looked like\nsome kind of small emergency bunker. Not intended for long-term\noccupancy, but a safe bolt-hole in case of … what? Riots in the streets? Or\nsomething more nefarious, like an accidental weapon detonation?\nChilled, Wax inspected the room and found scrapes on the floor\nindicating a hidden door on one wall. He opened it without much difficulty\n—though it was made of thick reinforced metal—and found a path into the\nstorm drain. Light peeked in through the grates above, and the scent—\nthough unpleasant—wasn’t terrible. Not a true sewer, just a place for"

Not a true sewer, just a place for\nwashing rainwater out of the streets and toward the ocean.\nAnd a nice emergency exit from the mayor’s mansion, he thought, noting\nnumerous footprints in the sludge and dried muddy ones in the concrete\ntunnel up ahead. A little farther along, he found a small motorized cart,\nopen roofed, perfect to drive in these tight confines. The wheels were\ncovered in sludge, and there were numerous tire tracks in the mud beyond.\nThere were no keys in the cart, and though supposedly there was a way\nto start one without them, that was a feat of thievery he’d never studied.\nInstead Wax pulled the folded-up calendar from his coat pocket and noted\nagain the numerous appointments at the “lab.” Back and forth, sometimes a\ncouple of times a day. If Wax had been visiting a secret installation that\nfrequently, he would most certainly have wanted a covert way to travel.\nWax started into the tunnel on foot, but then phantoms from long ago\nrose around him. For the briefest moment, he wasn’t in a drainage sewer in\nthe most modern city of the Basin. He was in a dirty mine adit, haunted by\ntwisted “artwork” made by a terrible mind. Golden light sifting down from\nabove. A meeting with destiny.\nSomeone else moves us.\nA deep breath and a moment of peace banished the phantoms. They’d be\nwith him forever, but they didn’t haunt him any longer. They were more\nlike echoes than ghosts. Reminders of the man he’d been, the life he’d led,\nand the people he’d loved. They were remembered, but today he had work\nto do. He found a service ladder to the street above, and climbed up to go\nfind Wayne. Hopefully he wasn’t on fire.\nBlessedly, he found Wayne alive and only slightly singed, waiting at the\nprearranged rally point. A bar, because of course it was. Wayne had picked\nthe spot.\nWax slid into the seat beside his friend, and Wayne passed him a shot of\nwhiskey, which Wax downed with a hiss of satisfaction. They left money on\nthe counter, then slipped out the back.\n“You find anythin’?” Wayne asked as they reached the end of the alley\nbehind the bar.\n“Some writings that might be relevant,” Wax said. “Calendar. Letters.\nMore importantly, a secret tunnel—hopefully leading somewhere useful.”\n“Nice,” Wayne said.\n“What happened to you?”\n“Eh,” Wayne said. “Nothin’ that interesting.”\nWax looked at him, then at the burn marks on his trousers.\n“Couldn’t do Grandma’s Been at the Vodka,” Wayne explained.\n“Couldn’t find a wig in time. So I did Flaming Bunny instead.”\n“Flaming Bunny,” Wax said flatly. “Please tell me you didn’t set a rabbit\non fire, Wayne.”\n“Of course not. I couldn’t find a damn wig in time; where would I find a\nrabbit?”\n“Good, I—”\n“You use a cat for Flaming Bunny. And those are all over the dang\nplace.”\n“Wayne. You set a cat on fire?”"

A sadist?”\nWax relaxed a little.\n“You throw the cat out a window,” Wayne explained.\n“Oh, Harmony…” Wax said. “Why?”\n“To save it from the flames, of course!” Wayne shook his head as Wax\nled him toward the storm drain. “That’s the plan. You start a big fire, then\ngo around screaming and throw a cat out the window. People believe you\nand think you’re saving pets.”\n“Then…”\n“Then you shout that someone has to save the bunny,” he said. “You\nlead everyone in to knock on the doors and get folks outta the place, and\neverybody gets all crazy and distracted helpin’ you.”\nWax stopped on the street, gawking at the Silver House with everyone\nelse. It was now almost fully ablaze, a terrible plume of smoke rising from\nit, like the Deepness itself.\n“You did say,” Wayne noted, “that following an egregious diplomatic\nincident, we might as well have some fun.”\n“That is not what I said.” Wax sighed.\n“What?” Wayne said. “You still on about that cat thing?”\n“You really threw it out a window?”\n“What would you have done? Leave it to burn? I hadda rescue the\nthing.”\n“Rescue the cat. From a fire you made. A cat that you kidnapped\nexpressly for that purpose.”\nWayne grinned. “Oh, don’t worry. I hucked him at a tree real good. Cats\nalways land in trees, so long as you throw them hard enough.”\n“Why … why would you think that?”\n“Dunno,” Wayne said as Wax started them moving again. “Must have\nlearned it in school.”\n“Did you … go to school?”\n“As a kid? Nah. But I burned one down once, before I even developed\nFlaming Bunny. Maybe the cat thing was on the board or something in\nthere.”\n“Wait. When did you burn down a school?”\n“West’s Haven?” Wayne said. “Nine years back. It was an evil damn\nschool.”\nWax hesitated at the mouth of the alley with the access ladder, thinking.\nWest’s Haven …\nOh, right. That had been an evil damn school.\n“Fine,” Wax said, pulling open the hatch to the storm drain. “Let’s keep\nmoving.”\nWayne climbed down. At the bottom, he grunted.\n“What?” Wax said, joining him.\n“Don’t tell Marasi ’bout this,” he said. “I told her you ain’t never taken\nme into a sewer. Least this one doesn’t stink…” He squinted. “Actually,\nkinda looks like a narrow canyon, with all those lights coming in the top…”\n“Why would you say that?” Wax said.\n“No reason.”\nThey both turned around as the bells of the fire brigade sounded from\nabove.\n“So…” Wayne said. “Calendar and letters, was it?”\nWax nodded. “Gave has been visiting a place called the lab, though he\nalso left for two weeks for some kind of trajectory test a couple months ago.\nDisguised as a vacation.”"

He dug in his pocket a moment, then passed\nthe calendar to Wayne.\nWho whistled softly. “No appointments after today?”\n“I noticed that too.”\n“‘They arrive’…” Wayne said, reading.\nWax nodded, giving Wayne a moment with the calendar pages while he\npulled out the letters. The light wasn’t great down here, but he could make\nout enough in the sunlight coming through the grates. Reading the two\nletters again, one extremely incriminating, the other full of pleasantries.\nWhat …\nOh, rusts. “Wayne,” he said, holding up the incriminating letter they’d\ngotten from the newspaper editor. “This is a forgery.”\n“What? Really?” Wayne took it. “How do you know?”\n“Before all this started,” Wax said, “I spent a good amount of time on an\noperation that implicated Vennis Hasting—who supposedly wrote that letter\n—in a scandal. I proved that he had been bribing other senators. In order to\nmake our case, Steris and I authenticated letters we’d acquired from him.\nRusts. I visited three separate handwriting analysts, and they talked\nspecifically about the distinctive turn of Vennis’s strokes. Which aren’t right\nin this one.” He felt his eyes widen. “That’s what it means … that’s what\nshe’s doing…”\n“Mate,” Wayne said. “You’ve gotta be more clear. ’Cuz I sure ain’t\nfollowing.”\n“My sister,” Wax explained. “She needs a way to seize control of the\nBasin, and prove to Autonomy she can rule here. I’ve been wondering how\nblowing up Elendel achieves that.”\n“It would remove a whole lot of barriers.”\n“Yes, but surely the other cities would never follow someone who\ncommitted such an atrocity.” Wax held up the fake letter. “Unless Telsin\ncould claim she didn’t blow up Elendel. Unless she had proof—in the form\nof forged letters—that the senators inside Elendel were the ones developing\nthe bomb. With the right evidence, she could make it look like they\nmistakenly blew themselves up.”\n“Oooh, that’s devious,” Wayne said. “She can ‘recover’ some of the\ndetails of that weapon too, so Bilming will ‘reluctantly’ have access to the\ntechnology to protect the Basin from the Malwish. Hell … that would work.\nRemove Elendel. Unite the Basin. Achieve dominance on the planet.”\nA piece locked into place. Even Gave’s letters—the real ones from\nVennis Hasting—made sense now. They’d needed handwriting samples,\nhence the cordial letters between mayor and senator.\n“And the lack of appointments after today?” Wayne asked. “Seems like\nour deadline’s even tighter than we feared.”\n“We need to find this lab,” Wax said, starting along the storm drain\nagain. “And hope the bomb is there.”\nWayne nodded, joining him.

Gave had scheduled fifteen minutes on\neither side of his appointments for travel to the lab—so it wouldn’t be too\nfar.\nAs they walked, Wax found himself increasingly worried. About what\nTelsin was doing. About the implications of it all. So he was a little relieved\nwhen Wayne broke the silence.\n“Sooooo…” Wayne said. “When you were in the mayor’s office … did\nyou notice if he had a nice desk?”\n“He had a rather nice one,” Wax said. “Why?”\n“Did you…” He nodded back in the direction of the Silver House. “You\nknow…”\n“Fart in his chair?”\n“Yup.”\n“Wayne. Of course I didn’t.”\nThey walked a little farther through the muck, finding a place where\nkids had obviously snuck down, judging by the graffiti painted on the walls:\ngiant sweeping Terris patterns of V’s.\n“Okay,” Wax finally said, unable to let it go despite trying quite\nforcefully, “why would you even think that I would do that to his chair? You\nexplicitly said not to, and beyond that … what the hell? Who does that?”\n“Nobody, nobody,” Wayne said. “It’s good you didn’t. Gotta stay classy,\nyou know. ’Specially in times like this. Very serious. Bombs threatening\ncities. Likely detonation today. No time for frivolity.”\nHe paused.\n“But…” Wayne continued, “if I’d been there, and seen that fancy\nchair … Well, I like those chairs, you know? The type that leans all the way\nback, and is all leather, and firm enough for support, but not so firm that it’s\nuncomfortable. You know?\n“And I’d think, ‘Damn, that’s a fancy chair.’ And I’d wonder … would\nthe old backyard mistmaker sound different? What if I released a little\nconcentrated essence of Wayne into those perfect leather contours? Would it\nfeel different? Would my cheeks—”\n“That’s enough. Please.”\n“Oh, right. Okay.”\nThey continued on a little farther, but something about his words …\nWax again tried to put it out of his mind, but …\n“Wayne,” he finally said, closing his eyes, feeling angry at himself for\ncontinuing the conversation. “I have a chair just like that back in my study\nin the penthouse.”\n“That you do,” Wayne said solemnly. “You do indeed.”\nOh hell. “Wayne. Did you—”\n“Wax, the whole city is in danger, you know? You need to stop letting\nyour attention drift, mate. First that fixation on me maybe setting\ngovernment buildings on fire—only twice, mind you, which isn’t a pattern,\njust a coincidence. Now this fascination with what comes outta my\nbackside. Can’t we keep focused on important things?”\n“Yeah, I suppose.”\n“Like this art,” Wayne said, admiring some graffiti. “Ma was right. This\nplace is beautiful.”\n“Ma?” Wax said. “Do I want to know what you’re talking about this\ntime?”\n“This just reminds me of an old story with a canyon,” Wayne said,"

Last one she gave\nme. So I remember it well, you know?”\n“No,” Wax said. “How is this tunnel a canyon?”\n“It just is,” Wayne said softly, looking up as they passed under another\ngrate, sunlight crossing his face in a checkerboard pattern. “Been thinking\nabout it since earlier today. It’s inevitable, you know?”\n“I don’t,” Wax said. “I really don’t, Wayne.”\n“Well it just is,” he said. “Even if you don’t know it. You’re the hero,\nWax, and you got a mission. Barm. The nastiest monster what ever lived.\nYou’re gonna stop him…” He hesitated. “Watch out. Might be some snakes\nin this canyon.”\n“It’s a storm drain,” Wax said, “and I’ve never seen a snake in the city.”\n“Yeah, they’re damn good at sneaking,” Wayne said. “Speaking of\nsnakes: the Set, they’ll know that was us with the mansion.”\n“Undoubtedly,” Wax said. “They might push into the mayor’s study to\nrecover sensitive documents. I couldn’t replace the rug above the trapdoor\n—so they’ll know I found the tunnel.”\n“Ah, great.”\n“Great?”\n“You’re supposed to find a bad guy in the canyon,” Wayne explained.\n“If the story is going to go right, at least.”\n“Wayne,” Wax said. “We’re not in a canyon in your mother’s story.\nWe’re in a storm drain in Bilming, trying to find and stop an explosive\ndevice. We—”\nHe was interrupted by a gunshot just ahead, echoing in the narrow\ntunnel—and a bullet hit the concrete near Wax’s head with a pop, blasting\nout a chip.\nThey both immediately ducked to the sides, getting low, and saw\nshadows moving in the tunnel ahead, just around a bend. Wax picked out\ntwo figures crouching beside the curve of the tunnel—the Coinshot he’d\nfought earlier, and a shorter woman wearing a bowler hat.\n“Hey,” Wayne said. “Will you look at that. Bad guys and snakes. Both at\nthe same time.”\n47\nMarasi’s team neared the bottom of the elevator shaft without incident,\ncarefully using TwinSoul’s roseite ladder. Red-pink dust crumbled around\nher as she slowed her climb, the little motes often evaporating in the air\nbelow her. Marasi probably had a dusting of them in her hair—smoldering\nthere, like simmering ashes without the heat.\nThey found the large service elevator settled snug on the bottom of the\nshaft. TwinSoul expanded his ladder to the sides so all three of them could\nclimb down beside one another. Then Marasi tested the roof of the elevator\nwith her toe. Solid, sturdy metal. She lowered her weight onto it carefully,\nand it didn’t even bow. She nodded to the others, who joined her.\n“Now what?” Moonlight whispered.\n“Service hatch,” Marasi said, locating one set into the other corner. She\neased it open.

The front doors of the elevator were open, though she\ncouldn’t see much more from this angle. She waved TwinSoul over. “Can\nyou see if there is anyone watching below?”\nA small line of roseite provided answers.\n“Silajana sees two guards,” TwinSoul whispered. “A man and a woman,\narmed with rifles. They are opposite the open elevator door, near a natural\nstone wall. It appears that we have indeed arrived at a series of tunnels and\ncaverns.\n“The guards do not seem observant, and are currently looking at one\nanother rather than the elevator. Should I try to send them to the aethers,\ntheir souls left to ruminate on their poor choices in this particular life?”\n“She wants to remain quiet, TwinSoul,” Moonlight said. “That might be\noverkill.”\n“I can handle this,” Marasi whispered. “Though it would help if you\ncould lower me through that hole a little, TwinSoul, so I can see.”\nHe obliged, creating a small lattice of crystals to support her as she\nlowered her head into the elevator, her hair hanging down. The two guards\nstood amid some large crates, facing each other and leaning back against\nseparate boxes. TwinSoul was right. They weren’t paying attention.\nActually, they appeared to be flirting. At least, the man was giggling at his\nown jokes, and the woman was pretending not to be impressed.\nFrom her side pouch, Marasi took out one of her Allomantic grenades\nand then attached her fishing line. She charged the grenade, then waited—\nand patience rewarded her when the man said something that finally made\nthe woman laugh. With them distracted Marasi threw her grenade, which\nactivated immediately after touching down. The two guards—focused on\none another—hopefully wouldn’t notice that time around them had slowed.\n“All right,” Marasi whispered, holding the fishing line. “Let’s go.”\nMarasi dropped into the elevator with a thump. Moonlight followed\nmore stealthily, prowling forward as she landed. TwinSoul lowered\nmajestically on a pole of roseite with a foothold. He stepped off, then\nstumbled and put his hand to the wall of the elevator, steadying himself.\nThe three of them checked the tunnel for any other guards—it was\nempty—and slipped out, careful not to touch the barely visible edge of the\nslowness bubble, which was shimmering like the air above hot pavement.\nThe two guards remained frozen there. The woman’s eyes closed as she\nlaughed, the man grinning and fixated on his companion. Hopefully he\nwouldn’t catch blurs from the corner of his eye. Marasi and the others hid in\na nearby cross tunnel. She yanked her grenade up and out using the fishing\nline, and the bubble collapsed.\nShe snatched the grenade from the air as the female guard’s laugh\nechoed from amid the crates. Marasi waited, tense. Had they been seen?\nHad either of them heard the grenade hit the stone over the sound of\nlaughter?\nTheir conversation continued as if nothing had happened.

Marasi\nnodded in relief to the others, and they prowled a little farther down their\ncurrent tunnel. It was lit by a series of miner’s lights on a thick cord on the\nwall, creating alternating darker sections and brightly lit ones.\n“That was well executed,” Moonlight whispered as Marasi rewound the\nfishing line. “Only one way to go for now: down this tunnel?”\nMarasi nodded.\n“I feel exposed like this,” TwinSoul whispered. “We could encounter\nmore guards.”\nMarasi felt the same, but there was little they could do. They continued\nalong the tunnel, which felt much like the ones she’d entered with Wayne\nthe other day. Smooth, ancient rock—with some rubble here and there\nshowing that chunks had fallen in from the ceiling during the explosive-\nweapon tests. And perhaps some of the blasts had been used not to test, but\nto connect tunnels and caverns.\nVoices echoed from up ahead. Marasi glanced behind them at the long,\nexposed tunnel, then pointed forward, toward one of the darker sections\nwhere she thought she saw some larger chunks of rubble. TwinSoul lagged\nbehind, despite his promise, as Marasi and Moonlight hurried into the\nshadows.\nNone of those speaking were visible yet, as the tunnel turned ahead.\nMarasi crouched behind some rubble, Moonlight joining her. The stone\nchunks only just came up past her knees when she crouched, but it was\nbetter than nothing. They waved anxiously to TwinSoul, who did his best,\nstumbling as he arrived and falling to his knees near them.\nThen stone began to grow from his hand. It arced up around them,\ndarker colored than his usual roseite. Though it was still pink, the shadows\nhid the color. He took a long drink from his backpack to restore his water,\nthen—at his urging—they all crouched as low as they could go and let the\nroseite grow over them, leaving a small section clear at the front so they\ncould see what was happening outside.\nA group of patrolling soldiers wandered around the bend. There were\nonly five of them, but Marasi was glad for the cover as they paused and\nchatted about the lord mayor’s visit, then split up in opposite directions.\nOne patrol went back toward the elevator, right past their hiding place.\nThey didn’t even look down.\nStill, Marasi’s heart thundered in her chest until the tunnel fell silent\nagain, and she risked a whisper. “You two certainly are handy.”\n“Thank you, my lady,” TwinSoul said.\n“This is only a fraction of the talents members of the Ghostbloods\nhave,” Moonlight noted. “You’ll be amazed at the things we will show\nyou.”\n“If I join,” Marasi said. “I don’t truly know what you are, what you do.”\n“Well, that is easy to explain,” TwinSoul said. “We have three general\ntenets.”\n“Protect Scadrial,” Moonlight said, standing up as the roseite shell\nbegan to disintegrate.\n“But neither of you are from here,” Marasi whispered.\n“True,” TwinSoul said, “but my homeland is inhospitable to my kind for"

I joined Lord Kelsier for the opportunity to gain allies and resources\nfor my eventual fight against the dark aether. And having this planet remain\nsafe and uncorrupted is a worthy goal on its own.”\n“And you?” Marasi asked Moonlight. “You can’t go home either?”\n“I can’t,” she said, “but I don’t care so much about that. I’m keeping an\neye on a particular enemy of the Ghostbloods. Plus I like secrets.” She\nnodded forward.\nThey continued, and after they checked around the bend and made sure\nno one else was coming, Marasi whispered to Moonlight, “What are the\nother two tenets?”\n“We share what we know with each other,” Moonlight said. “There are\nno secrets within a team. If you ask Kelsier, even he’ll tell you what he’s\nplanning. But you absolutely can’t share secrets outside the organization\nwithout his permission.”\n“And the last one?”\n“We trust each other,” TwinSoul said. “We’re a team. A family. You join\nus, you absolutely swear not to make a move against another Ghostblood.\nNo infighting. No betrayals. No undermining one another. No squabbling\nover resources or favor.”\n“We take it very seriously, Marasi,” Moonlight said. “And the way you\nact—your attitude as part of a team—is one of the main reasons we came to\nyou.”\nAnd not, she implied, to Wax. They went on, Marasi chewing on those\ntenets. She swallowed the last one easily. Not moving against one another?\nNot undermining the mission or goals of another member of the group?\nThat sounded wonderful. More than once, she’d collided with another\nconstable’s ambition, preventing her from getting things done.\nThe other tenet though … Not sharing information with those outside?\nThat sat in her gut like a stone. She was a constable for the city of Elendel.\nJoining the Ghostbloods would be like … like swearing allegiance to\nanother country.\nBut the secrets they knew … the things they were doing … She doubted\nthat if she joined the Ghostbloods, she’d ever have to waste her time\ndealing with small-time criminals again.\nShe put it all out of her mind for the time being as they reached an\nintersection. The rightmost turn was particularly well-lit. There, two long,\nnarrow structures had been built out along the tunnel, one on each side. The\npath continued between them, as if they were shops on a street.\nPeeking around the corner into this tunnel, Marasi could see that one of\nthe two buildings was guarded by thick-armed men. The lord mayor’s\nbodyguards. The two men were distracted though, talking to someone\ninside. Which gave Marasi an opportunity.\nShe led the way, crouching low around the corner, and crossed the short\ndistance to the rightmost building. She was joined by the other two as the\nbodyguards finished their conversation and closed the door, settling into\nguard postures.\nA window on this short end of the building, where Marasi and the others\nhid, gave her a chance to steal a look.

The\nlord mayor himself, in formal dining wear, hair slicked back with\nsomething greasy, sitting at a table. Aside from him, there were two\nadditional guards settling in by the door. Four people in white lab coats\nhuddled near Gave’s table, one handing him something to drink.\nMarasi frowned, noticing Gave’s slumped-over posture. He looked …\nworn. Far less commanding or smug than he was at the police station.\nHe shook his head. “What odds do you give her,” he asked, his voice\nmuffled from inside, but audible, “of getting that bomb to fly. Of actually\nsalvaging this?”\n“That’s … not my department, sir,” one of the scientists said. “I’m not\nan engineer.”\n“I can’t believe it’s come to this,” Gave said, his voice softening. “I\ndidn’t think … when I agreed … Are they here?”\n“Nearly,” another scientist said.\n“How many?” Gave asked.\n“A lot,” the woman replied. “An army of soldiers with golden skin and\nglowing red eyes. Sir, is it true? Are they…”\nGave pounded the table. “I’m supposed to be in control! She’s supposed\nto fail, and I’m supposed to take her place.”\n“You will, sir,” one of the scientists said. “If she doesn’t get the bomb\nworking, Autonomy will kill her.”\n“And invade the whole rusting Basin,” Gave said, hands to his face.\n“Maybe the world. Damn. It wasn’t supposed to be like this…” He downed\nhis shot and hauled himself to his feet.\nMarasi shared a glance with the others. They’d known Autonomy was\nplanning some sort of decisive attack if Telsin failed to prove she could\ncontrol the Basin. It seemed that maybe Gave had been assigned to facilitate\nthat?\nIt would be convenient for him, she thought, to have these caverns as a\nbunker in case a destructive war breaks out above. That would explain the\nfood, too.\nAnd some kind of invading army?

I can’t believe I let it get this far. We need some kind\nof military presence to corral those alien soldiers.”\n“Can we do that?” the scientist asked.\n“I don’t know,” he said, putting his hand to his head. “I don’t want to\nrule ashes. Rusts, Edwarn’s plans were always superior. We should have\nbeen pushing for those, instead of Telsin’s idiotic bomb.”"

We should have\nbeen pushing for those, instead of Telsin’s idiotic bomb.”\n“Yes, my lord mayor,” Labcoat said. “Speaking of Edwarn’s plans, did\nyou … want to proceed with the test?”\nHe waved for her to do so, and Labcoat sent her two assistants to the far\nside of the room, the stone wall of the tunnel. Marasi had missed a thick\ndoor set into the rock—made of strong wood, with sturdy locks on the\noutside.\nThe assistants undid these, opening the door to reveal a group of some\ntwenty people huddled in the darkness. They wore an assortment of\ndifferent kinds of clothing—some expensive, others just common work\nclothes. All were grungy and rumpled. With pistols drawn, the assistants\npicked out a lean woman in a torn evening dress, her face streaked with\nmakeup. She barely resisted, looking too exhausted for anything more than\na token protest.\nThe door was locked again, and the assistants strapped her facedown to\na table. Then one took out a silvery spike, long and thin. Marasi felt a chill,\nthen nausea. Was this …\nOh, Ruin. Were they making an Allomancer? She’d read about the\nprocess in the book Death had given her, but she’d never wanted to see it in\nperson.\nLabcoat took out a notebook. “We believe that we’ve isolated the\ntechnique Edwarn was on to,” she said. “Indeed, we’ve refined it. The\nprocess involves a very thin spike, my lord mayor, and, oddly, the right\nmindset.”\n“Mindset?” he asked.\n“You need to know what you’re doing and why,” the woman explained.\n“It helps to whisper a Command as you work, though we find it isn’t strictly\nnecessary. Trauma on the part of the subject is helpful as well.”\nAt a nod from her, the assistants threaded the long spike through the\nskin of the woman’s upper back. Almost like they were sewing with a six-\ninch needle. The poor woman made a pained whimper, and the assistant\ndoing the procedure mumbled something to himself, then pushed the needle\nslowly back through her skin, as if making two holes for some kind of\npiercing. The woman screamed louder as the process finished.\nAs soon as the spike left her skin, the holes started bleeding. The woman\nfell silent, and the assistant washed off the bloodied spike and handed it to\nLabcoat, who promptly placed it in a solution attached to a device and\nexamined it.\n“Roughly five percent Invested,” she reported to Entrone. “And as you\ncan see, the subject is still alive. We’ve essentially excised a piece of the\nsoul and stored it in the metal.”\nWait.\nThey’d made a spike without killing the woman?\nThat was supposed to be impossible. Granted, Marasi hadn’t studied\nDeath’s book in as much detail as Wax had, but she was fairly sure\nHemalurgy always killed its subject.\n“So?” Entrone said. “I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but I don’t\nparticularly care if these people live or die. Creating spikes without killing\nthem is pointless. We need Metalborn in huge numbers. That will impress\nAutonomy. That will make her realize this planet is a resource, not"

That will make her realize this planet is a resource, not\nsomething to be burned.”\n“Ah, my lord,” the woman said. “This woman isn’t Metalborn. We’ve\nInvested a spike—a tiny bit, granted—using an ordinary person. All people\nare Invested by Ruin and Preservation as part of our very makeup—and we\nhave a little extra Preservation, blessed by the Shards upon our creation.\nWe’re pulling some of that out.\n“The percentage you get depends on the person. We think it might have\nto do with how likely they were, genetically, to be Metalborn. But they\ndon’t need that extra if the powers didn’t manifest in them. It’s vestigial. We\nsimply slice it off and use it in a spike. Fully Investing one takes between\ntwenty and thirty people.”\n“But can you make Allomancers from those spikes,” Entrone said.\n“That’s the key part.”\nThe scientist glanced at the others. “Sir, this is a fantastic result. A huge\nstep forward in—”\n“Can you make me Allomancers?” he demanded. “Now. Today. To show\nAutonomy.”\n“No,” Labcoat admitted. “We think we need to code this in some way to\ngive a specific Metallic Art blessing. We’re working on that. We’ve had\nsome few gain a power for a short time using one of these spikes, but it\ngives out soon after.”\n“Damn,” Entrone muttered. “That means Edwarn’s Community project\nhere is still valuable.” He folded his arms, looking worn down again. “But\nwe have nothing to show Autonomy at the present. I’m going to have to do\nit. I’m going to have to let her army through. Call all of our remaining\nloyalists—those not working directly for Telsin—into the caverns.”\n“But—” Labcoat began.\n“We wait,” he said, “for Telsin to initiate her plan. We give her every\nopportunity. And then … then if it doesn’t work…”\n“We survive,” Labcoat said.\n“We survive.” He nodded to himself. “I’m going to the Community to\nsee to the perpendicularity.” He waved toward the cell at the rear of the\nroom. “They have all heard and seen too much. They are a liability. Execute\nthem.”\n“Of course, my lord,” Labcoat said. Entrone left, leaving the two guards\ninside, but collecting the two in the tunnel. He slammed the door, making\nthe flimsy structure shake. Fortunately, once outside, he turned and\ncontinued farther into the complex instead of walking past Marasi and her\nteam.\n“Fetch me some invel gas pellets,” Labcoat said to the assistants in the\nroom. “That will be a painless end for the captives. Fion, tell our loyalists to\nretreat to the caverns. They can bring their families, but nothing else. A\npriority-one evacuation order. This is the real thing.”\nOne of the assistants left at a dead run, also going farther into the\ncomplex. The other began fiddling in cabinets at the side of the room.\nMarasi and the two Ghostbloods crouched in the shadows, whispering."

The other began fiddling in cabinets at the side of the room.\nMarasi and the two Ghostbloods crouched in the shadows, whispering.\n“We have to get this information to Kelsier,” Moonlight said. “A new\nway of making spikes could change everything.”\n“It’s still brutal,” Marasi whispered back. “Stealing a piece of someone’s\nsoul? It’s better than murdering them, but I doubt this is something we\ncould use in good conscience.”\n“You don’t understand,” Moonlight said. “If they’re even close to\nforging Metalborn out of the raw power of souls—if they’ve had tests that\nresulted in an Allomancer, no matter how fleeting … Marasi, that path could\nlead to creating spikes using pure Investiture instead of souls.” She tapped\nher rucksack, indicating the glowing jars inside.\nRuin. The ability to create spikes in a mechanical way? Even the process\nof making medallions among the Malwish required Metalborn. If what\nMoonlight implied was right, then it would change everything.\n“For now,” TwinSoul said, “Silajana reminds us that the planet itself is\nin danger. Getting information to Lord Kelsier is meaningless if that\ninvasion happens. We must follow Entrone and see if we can interfere with\nAutonomy’s plans.”\nMarasi peeked around the corner, looking farther down the tunnel. They\ncould sneak past. But the people in that room were about to be executed …\n“We have to help the prisoners,” Marasi said.\n“A few lives are meaningless right now,” Moonlight said. “We need to\nkeep moving. It’s our way.”\n“It’s not mine,” Marasi said. “I’m an officer of the law. I can’t leave a\ngroup of people to be murdered. Besides, he said they’d heard too much.\nThey know something of use to us.”\nMoonlight and TwinSoul glanced to one another.\n“I’m going to help them,” Marasi said. “There are only two guards. We\nshould be able to stop those with ease.”\n“If anything goes wrong,” Moonlight said, “it could alert everyone\ndown here. One gunshot…”\nMarasi hesitated, weighing the risks. It might be foolish, she\nacknowledged, but she hadn’t become a constable to leave people to be\nmurdered. She stood up straight. “It is a risk I will take. Are you with me, or\ndo I do it alone?”\nThe other two stood. “Let’s do it quickly then,” Moonlight said.\n48\nSteris had heard that in a fire, the rats were often the first creatures out.\nThey could smell the smoke before the flames raged out of control—and so,\non occasion, you could get an early warning of impending danger by\nwatching the rats flee.\nThat was what she did now, while organizing her thoughts and listening\nto the other senators prepare their escape routes. She watched Lady Gardre,\nthe woman Steris was almost certain was a member of the Set. So long as\nGardre remained in the city, they had time.\nBut as the minutes stretched long, waiting for TenSoon to return with\nthe Bands, she began to doubt. Perhaps it wasn’t Gardre.

Perhaps the Set didn’t\nactually have anyone in the government’s inner circle. Perhaps—\nAn aide bustled into the room—and stepped over to Lady Gardre,\nwhispering in her ear.\n“Ah,” Gardre said. “I’ll need to deal with this.” Gardre stood up,\nstraightening her jacket. “I’ll be back shortly.”\nSteris knew she wouldn’t be. Her departure meant the city was in\nimminent danger. She passed TenSoon on her way out, and he drew the\nattention of the others. They didn’t realize.\n“Now,” Adawathwyn said, striding around the table to TenSoon, “let’s\nsee how these work. Give me the Bands. Let me walk Harmony’s Path and\nsave the city! I am Metalborn, a Ferring of the mind. Whatever bomb is\nbeing delivered here, I can Push it away with the force of a planet! Or I can\nsoar to Bilming and bring justice to those miscreants!”\nAmbassador Daal stepped forward, his face hidden behind his mask.\n“This must be a negotiation. You promised that they wouldn’t be used.”\n“Surely you can see the need, Ambassador,” Steris said. “You don’t\nexpect us to simply die if this could save us?”\n“Surely you Northerners understand the meaning of the word\n‘promise,’” he said, looking at her through the holes in his mask. “I have\nthe authority to negotiate for their return to us.” He leaned forward, his\nhands on the table, and looked straight at the governor—who leaned away,\nhis eyes widening.\n“If you use them,” Daal continued, “then I demand that they must be\nturned over to us next, for use during the disaster of our choosing. A\ncompromise, yah? If you wish to avoid war, but also use these Bands, that\nis the only solution. You get this chance. We will also get a chance. Deal?”\nAll eyes in the room went to TenSoon. The kandra had validated the\ntreaty and had become keepers of the relic. It appeared the others thought\nhe could agree to this, and Steris supposed he was as close to an arbiter as\nthey had.\n“Harmony is preoccupied,” TenSoon said, “but our time is tight. So I\nwill agree to this if the humans do. The Basin may use the Bands right now.\nBut they revert to the Malwish.”\n“Do it,” the governor said. “If it could save the city … I agree.”\nIt was not the best situation for a negotiation, and Steris wondered how\nbadly they were being played. Daal must see this as the perfect opportunity\nto get what he wanted. Regardless, she still didn’t understand why TenSoon\nthought this might work. Yes, the Bands made a person a powerful\nMetalborn, but Daal acted as if they could win wars on their own—and\nTenSoon had this distant expression. He met her eyes.\n“What?” she asked.\n“We believe,” he whispered, “there is a way to transport objects large\ndistances using a conflux of Metalborn powers.

But I wonder … if someone feeling the\ntranscendent power of the Bands … could solve the puzzle.”\nFascinating. She took notes.\nTenSoon opened the box to present the Bands—which were in the shape\nof a large spearhead, made of multiple bands of different kinds of metal.\nThe governor nodded for Adawathwyn to take them. She reached in and\ntouched them, her eyes alight. She picked them up, held them for a moment,\nand frowned.\n“How…” she said. “How do I activate them?”\n“It was natural for Wax,” Steris said, walking over. She hesitantly poked\nthe Bands, and felt nothing.\nThey passed them around, letting everyone try. Finally TenSoon took\nthem, his face scrunched up in thought. Then horror followed. “They’re\ndrained,” he whispered. “Something has happened … How…?”\nWithout their power, the Bands of Mourning were essentially just a\nheavy piece of history. Like a statue’s broken arm.\nThe governor gave a groan of despair and leaned back in his chair,\nsqueezing his eyes shut. Salvation had just flitted away on butterfly wings.\nSteris couldn’t help wondering what she was missing. She’d never\nanticipated this. The Bands could be drained? By whom? And how?\nDaal stepped forward and touched them with one finger. “It’s true,” he\nmuttered. “What have you done? Have you been using these in secret?”\n“What?” Adawathwyn said. “No! We haven’t seen them in years, not\nsince the treaty!”\nDaal picked up the Bands in one hand. “I will return them to my\npeople.”\n“Wait,” Steris said, standing. “That wasn’t the deal.”\n“Wasn’t it?” he said. “You had your chance to use them. It happens they\nare useless to you. Now we must have our chance. I wonder if it is piety that\nmakes them work, yah? Or if maybe I am right, and you’ve been using\nthem all along. Our scholars will know if you are trying to pass off some\nfake.”\nSteris looked at him and had the distinct impression that was … a\nprepared speech? Yes. She prepared words to say even in common\nconversations. His mannerisms felt practiced, rehearsed. But surely she was\nwrong. He couldn’t have been prepared for this?\nUnless he’d known the Bands would be drained. Unless he’d come to\nElendel looking for a crisis that would make them call on the Bands, so he\ncould offer his deal. And then …\n“I don’t know if I can allow this,” the governor said.\n“I don’t know that we can forbid it,” TenSoon growled back. “You\nagreed.”\n“Ah,” Daal said. “Perhaps your Faceless Immortals can actually be\nimpartial? Curious. I had not believed it.”\nDaal took the Bands’ case from TenSoon, who growled low and\ndangerous—but let it go.\nSteris watched with an odd feeling of disconnect.

The Bands were not the solution today.\nBut there was a secret here that eventually she would like to tease out.\nThe ambassador walked to the door, but paused there, the Bands under\nhis arm. “I did promise you passage, Governor. If this city is doomed, as\nyou all think, then … if you wish, any of you may join me now. I will drop\nyou at a safer location.”\n“I’ll go,” Adawathwyn said immediately. She snatched her things off the\ntable.\n“Maybe…” the governor said. “Maybe we’re wrong. Mistaken\nsomehow about this danger…”\n“Are you a betting man, my lord governor?” Reddi asked. “Because I\nam. And I’ve learned to never bet against one particular man. If Dawnshot\nsays a bomb is pointed at us, it is.”\n“We need to evacuate the city.” Steris thumped her notebooks. “I have\nthe plans here. Full citywide emergency plans for various categories of\ndisaster. I had free time a few summers ago and was bored.”\n“This is what you do for fun?” Reddi asked.\n“Well, the house taxes were already done for the next year,” Steris said.\n“Here. This plan is the best for this situation. It gets the most people out of\nthe city the fastest. The longer we have, the more we save. It’s one of my\nmost efficient creations.” She looked up to the governor. “Please. We can’t\nleave. We have to protect the city.”\n“Are you coming or not?” Daal snapped from the doorway. Perhaps he\nwanted the honor—and political bargaining chip—of having saved the\ngovernor.\nGovernor Varlance glanced from him to Steris. Then toward\nAdawathwyn—whose robes flashed as she vanished out the door. The other\nsenators hastened to follow.\n“You,” Steris said softly to the governor, “are the captain of this city.\nThis entire nation. You were chosen by the people to represent them. I need\nyour authority to save as many of them as possible. There will be time for\nyou to escape later. For now, help me save this city.”\n“You … really have a plan?” the governor said.

Together he and Wayne ducked back\naround the curve in the tunnel, out of sight. The two of them waited there,\nWax with guns out, ready to fire. They were perhaps thirty yards from\nwhere they’d spotted the two doppel-dummies, blocking the way farther\nthrough the tunnel.\nWayne rolled his shoulder as the bullet wounds healed, draining his\nmetalminds a little further. He was using up his reserves pretty fast these\nlast few days. Fortunately, most of his work with Marasi hadn’t required\nmuch healin’. Her missions didn’t usually involve things like throwing\nWayne out windows like he was a rustin’ cat.\n“Oi!” the not-Wayne called from farther down the tunnel. “We can’t\nshoot you if you keep hidin’! Come out so we can get on with killing you,\nmates!”\nOh, now that was plain awful. She was trying too hard—that wasn’t a\nRoughs accent at all. It was inner-city Roughs enclave accent, with a bit of\nupper-crust theater thrown in—probably from her dialect coach. The\nresulting accent was ridiculous, just close enough to his natural accent that\nit was like rusty old spikes being pulled across a chalkboard.\n“What the hell is going on with those two?” Wayne whispered.\n“I suspect,” Wax replied, “that the Set realized they’d need to face us,\nconsidering the ruin we made of their plans a few years back. So they\nspiked a few of their members with powers to match ours and trained them\nto fight us.”\n“That one isn’t just tryin’ to fight me,” Wayne said. “She’s tryin’ to be\nme. You get the same sense from yours?”\n“No,” Wax said. “Other than the suit, he merely seems to be a competent\nCoinshot with a few extra spikes. Watch him, Wayne. He can burn up all of\nhis steel in a single terrible burst, supercharging his Push to extreme levels.\nBut he can also drain your abilities if he gets hold of you.”\n“So long as he has metals,” Wayne said.\n“The Set has some powerful resources, Wayne,” Wax said. “I’ll bet his\nchromium outlasts your bendalloy.”\n“We’ll see about that.” Wayne narrowed his eyes, peering around the\ncorner. “That one what thinks she’s like me, she’s doin’ a terrible job. I’m\nnot nearly that annoying.”\nWax calmly loaded a few bullets into his pistol.\n“Hey,” Wayne said. “Don’t you say it.”\n“I didn’t say a thing.” He snapped the revolver closed. “Unfortunately,\nany delay is to their advantage. Which means we’re going to have to go on\nthe offensive.”\n“Close confines down here, mate,” Wayne said. “Not great for\nSteelpushing. Real easy to get stuck in slow time while they coordinate to\ntrap us.”\n“See if you can catch all four of us inside a speed bubble together,” Wax\nsaid. “It’s close confines, yes—but for them too.”\n“They can make their own bubble, mate,” Wayne said. “Even inside"

So we should be good,\nif we’re in close together.”\n“Exactly,” Wax said. “If neither of us can rely on speed bubbles or flying\nhigh with Steelpushes, maybe our trained skill will overwhelm their\nborrowed abilities. We can try to throw that Steelpusher out of the bubble,\nto freeze him. Just don’t let him touch you, or he can Leech your powers.”\nA good enough plan, Wayne supposed. He dug in his pocket for the\naluminum-lined pouch his accountants had given him and pulled out a few\nbeads of bendalloy. Kept it in little marbles, easy to swallow.\nHe knocked them back. Wax nodded, and Wayne made as big a speed\nbubble as he could. They ran through it, broke out the other side, and\ndashed down the tunnel. It was a big concrete pipe thing, a good ten feet or\nmore across, the bottom containing a foot-or-two-wide section of sludge\nthat had partially dried, on account of the lack of rain recently.\nThe evil twins got a chance to deliberate in a speed bubble while Wayne\nand Wax moved. But they couldn’t do too much from inside one. Other than\nposition themselves really well for when the bubble ended. So, the moment\nWayne saw motion ahead, he dropped and rolled in the mud. So did Wax.\nBullets went streaking over their heads, where they’d been moments\nbefore. Wayne dashed the last few yards to close in on them, then tossed up\na large speed bubble—fifteen feet across—to catch all four people. Dueling\ncanes out, he went straight for the evil him, feigning a strike, dodging right,\nthen sweeping with a cane from the left to knock her in the noggin. She\nbarely managed to block him, then slid her weapon along his in a classic\nmaneuver to try and smack his fingers.\nHe shoved her back and went in again, and the next sequence of attacks\nhit like a drumbeat—wooden stick against wooden stick. He got a hit on\nher, but she barely flinched as her metalminds healed her. She returned the\nblow, and he took it without much more than a faint grunt. Though his ribs\ncracked, they healed right up.\n“Oi!” she said in that exaggerated parody of his accent. “That’s\ncheatin’!”\n“You ain’t me,” Wayne growled. “Don’t pretend you are.”\nShe grinned and slid in the mud in an admittedly skillful move, getting\npast him and dodging his next swing—all while rapping him on the arm\nhard enough to break the bone. He grimaced and flipped his hand to the side\nto reset the bone as his muscles pulled it back into place.\nHe fended off her next attack with one arm while the other healed,\nletting her force him to retreat. At that moment, Wax flew between them and\nslammed into the tunnel wall with a grunt. He tossed a handful of bullets in\nthe air, then ducked—tricking not-Wax into Pushing on them instead of\nhim.

I borrowed it.”\n“I don’t borrow neither! And your accent is sliding from Roughs street\ninto southern Elendel street gang! Gah! You’re gettin’ it all wrong!”\n“I love that you’re more worried about me imitating you poorly than\nyou are about me tryin’ to kill you,” she said, shoving her face up next to\nhis. She stabbed him in the chest—he hadn’t even seen her drop the dueling\ncane—with a glass knife. “It’s so you, Wayne!”\n“You don’t know me,” Wayne growled, managing to kick her leg and\nmake her slip a little. She loosened her grip, which let him rip free and\nmove around her, though her knife sliced him across the chest.\nRusts.

And in doin’\nso, he’d let the trainin’ slack off—having a little gum chew out behind the\nbuilding instead of working into the evening. With Marasi, he hadn’t spent\nquite so much time getting his head knocked in.\nBut this creature, well, she’d been trainin’ something hard. Focused\nentirely on this day, this meeting, this fight. He wasn’t brawlin’ with some\nbully off the street, or even some talented Set Metalborn. He was facin’ an\nassassin what had been designed specifically to kill him.\nShe was stronger than he was. Faster than he was. Younger than he was.\nBetter with the canes. He was better with his powers. He was certain of that.\nBut in these close confines, that didn’t really matter. And as he traded blows\nwith her, taking hits and forcing himself to heal, he … Well, he took more\npunishment than he gave. Rusts … was this what Wax felt like, now he was\ngettin’ on in years?\nHe rolled to the side, through the muck on the bottom of the giant tube\nthey was in. That put him right to the other edge of the speed bubble, and he\nslipped halfway out of it—though fortunately, so long as you were touching\nit at all it included you in its powers.\nA motion from where Wax was fightin’ made Wayne duck. Wax himself\nwent flying past again, and he soared completely out of the speed bubble.\nDamn. That was what they’d been planning to do to the other guy.\nWax froze instantly, hanging in the air with a grimace on his face, gun\ntrailing from his fingers and hovering in front of him, mistcoat tassels\nsweeping around him.\nUh-oh, Wayne thought.\nA spray of coins hit Wayne a second later.\n“Aw, Dumad,” not-Wayne said, turning. “I was havin’ fun. I’m supposed\nto be the one who takes him.”\n“You’re inefficient, Getruda,” Dumad said. “You play with him. You\nsimply need to hit him repeatedly until his health runs out.” He punctuated\nthis by giving Wayne another faceful of coins, knocking him to the ground.\nRusts. This was bad. Wayne healed that, but it was slow—his healing\nwas starting to run dangerously low. And he had to ration it as a result.\n“Oi,” he muttered, “Death. Betcha fifty clips I survive this.” It was a\ngood time for a bet. Because in such a situation, Wayne had to try\nsomething truly desperate.\nThe truth.\nHe stumbled to his feet, putting his back to the rounded wall of the\ntunnel. “You think you know me?” Wayne whispered. “You think you know\nwhat I’ve been through?”\nDumad looked at him, then Pushed. And rusts, the guy was so strong he\ncould affect the metal inside Wayne’s body. That was a crazy thing to\nexperience—Wayne was shoved backward from the coins embedded within\nhim. Rust and Ruin … that was a power that the Ascendant Warrior was\nsaid to have had."

Rust and Ruin … that was a power that the Ascendant Warrior was\nsaid to have had.\nThese guys really were cheating. No wonder Wax had lost his fight. No\nwonder Wayne had essentially lost his—the dueling portion at least. But if\nhe could keep their attention …\nHe grunted at the Push. Then he stepped forward anyway, feeling the\ncoins tear and rip inside him. He took another step, leaning forward into the\nPush.\nNot-him hesitated, lowering her canes. He met her eyes.\nThen he grinned.\n“You can’t hurt me,” he whispered, changing his accent. “Ain’t nothin’\nthat can hurt me more than life already has. You can’t kill me. I’m already\ndead. I been dead for years, sister.”\nHe took another step forward. Most people, they didn’t notice accent\nchanges like that. Little tweaks to the tone of your words. But people\njudged you on them anyway. Their brains associated accents with meaning.\nDumad frowned, seeming disturbed, and raised his hand and Pushed\nharder. Wayne slid in the mud, the coins ripping farther through him. Then\nhe took another step forward and changed his accent further. Put on his\nmost wide-eyed, excited face. Twisting his voice to be something unnatural.\nSomething terrifying. Something out of a nightmare. Matching this not-\nWax’s accent, but terrible.\nLike the accent he’d hear from his parents and family. Only broken.\nWayne didn’t need a hat for this one.\n“It’s easy to do what you do, since you don’t care,” Wayne growled to\nthe two, making his eyes go even wider. “So long as you can pretend. But\nreal pain, that comes when you realize what you are. What you done.\nWaking up each morning, knowin’ you’re worthless. That’s pain. Anything\nelse? Anything you could do to me? Well, that’s just a little bit o’ fun.”\n“You’re…” Dumad trailed off as Wayne’s smile widened.\n“Thank you,” Wayne said, “for tossin’ Wax outta here. That way I got a\nfew moments to have you two all to myself.”\nThe coins finally ripped through Wayne’s back, letting him lurch\nforward in a sudden rush. And as he did, he threw himself to the ground.\nBecause amid his display—getting them to focus only on him—he’d\ndropped the speed bubble. And they hadn’t noticed.\nFrom the side, Wax put a hazekiller round straight in not-Wayne’s face.\nIts secondary explosion went off a second later, blowing off half her skull.\nA second shot from Wax took Dumad in the chest as he was turning, then\nexploded out his back.\nIncredibly, the Coinshot didn’t fall. Pewter. Did the fellow have pewter\nto burn and push through wounds? How many spikes did this fellow have,\nand why hadn’t they let Harmony take control of him?\nUnfortunately, the man stayed on his feet and ducked the next bullets.\nHe shoved a grate off the ceiling, opening it up to the sunlight, then seized\nthe bloodied not-Wayne and Pushed on a coin.\nThe two launched up and out.

One with a hole in his chest that didn’t\nseem to hurt as much as it should have, the other with half her head gone.\nShe might be dead, though Wayne couldn’t be certain. Head shots were\ntricky. They could end you, but it all depended on the damage done.\nWax maybe should have put another few shots in them as they fled, but\nthe man looked pretty ragged from the fight. Breathing deeply, he slumped\nback against the wall of the tunnel. They’d come close to losing this fight.\nReal close.\nWayne stumbled to his feet, aching all over, and used his healing to seal\nthose coin wounds. But they remained sore. He was forced to stop healing\nto save the last bit of juice in his metalmind. Rusts.\nWayne turned and lurched over to Wax, his clothes a bloody, muddy\nmess. Wax’s, impossibly, were pretty nice—barely marked by the gunk on\nthe floor.\n“Hey!” Wayne said. “How the hell aren’t you covered in mud? I saw\nyou roll through it.”\n“I Pushed off a bullet when I did,” he said. He put a hand to his shoulder\nand groaned softly. “Nice job, with the distraction.” He met Wayne’s eyes.\n“Did you mean any of that?”\n“Nah, of course not,” Wayne said, looking away. Ruin, he felt\nexhausted. And creaky. Like a floor what had been walked on so much, all\nthe boards wobbled.\n“Wayne…”\n“Not the time, mate.” He settled down on the floor. “Rusts, I feel old.\nI’m not supposed to feel old. I’m the spry one!”\nWax settled down next to him on a dry part of the concrete. “You’re\nthirty-nine, Wayne. It catches up to you.”\n“You infected me, you did,” Wayne grumbled. “I never felt old when I\nwas workin’ with Marasi!”\n“I infected you,” Wax said, “with being old?”\n“Damn right.”\n“That’s ludicrous even for you.”\n“No it ain’t. You done started to think yourself old, and it drilled into my\nhead too.” Wayne tapped at his skull. “Ideas is infectious, Wax. More than\ndiseases.”\nThey caught their breath for a few more moments. Unfortunately, they\ncouldn’t linger.\n“They know for sure we found this tunnel,” Wayne said. “If there’s\nsome kind of lab at the end of it, they’ll be clearing it out as we speak.”\nWax nodded and heaved himself back to his feet. He reached out a hand\nto help Wayne up.\n“We need to talk,” Wax said. “About you. The way you’ve been feeling\nlately.”\n“Sure. Okay. I like talkin’. But later.”\nLater was always better.\nTogether, they pressed forward. “I got the woman pretty good,” Wax\nsaid. “Do you think that killed her?”\n“Depends. How’s your luck been lately?”\n“Awful,” Wax admitted. “But at least we know we’re on the right trail."

How’s your luck been lately?”\n“Awful,” Wax admitted. “But at least we know we’re on the right trail.\nOtherwise they wouldn’t have tried so hard to stop us.”\n“Yeah, sure,” Wayne said. “I’m glad we’re done with the canyon, but the\nhardest part is yet to come. The mesa, which is gonna gobble you up.\nRemember to choke it from the inside.”\n“I’ll do my best.”\n50\nMarasi drew up a quick plan—which was the only kind they could afford.\nMoonlight and TwinSoul stayed near the window, ready to break in. Marasi\nworked her way up to the front of the building to place a grenade by the\ndoor. The slowness bubble would work through the wall, trapping the two\nguards who stood inside. As she charged her weapon, however, Moonlight\nducked around the side of the rectangular structure and scuttled up to\nMarasi.\n“Guards just moved,” she hissed. “They’re getting gas masks from a bin\nnear the scientists.”\nRusts. She couldn’t let them release the gas.\n“We go in now,” Marasi hissed. “Back me up if the grenade fails.”\nMoonlight nodded, and Marasi kicked in the door and hurled her\ngrenade toward the group of people in the left corner, near the window\nwhere she and the others had been spying.\nSorry, TwinSoul, she thought, knowing the grenade would catch him too.\nHer aim was solid, and the grenade box bounced off one lab table, then fell\nto the floor near the group of guards and scientists.\nThe two guards immediately leaped away, one sliding over the table, the\nother one dashing for the front of the room. One of the scientists was also at\nthe perimeter and—unfortunately—jumped away in surprise.\nWhen the grenade activated, it caught only two of the scientists in gas\nmasks. Luckily, that included the one holding a tin with warning labels on\nit, presumably the poison tablets.\nMarasi’s grenade would keep them frozen. But now she had to deal with\nthe others without raising an alarm. The free scientist was cringing at the\nside of the room, so Marasi dashed forward and slammed her rifle’s butt\ninto the arm of one guard, who had been pulling out a pistol. Moonlight\nmoved behind her—hopefully dealing with the other guard, because the\nman Marasi had attacked decided to slam into her, shoving her back against\na table full of beakers.\nShe grunted as he rammed her own rifle up almost to her neck.\nGlassware shattered on the floor around her, and a part of her panicked. The\npart of her that still, even after all these years, worried she wasn’t good\nenough and didn’t belong.\nThat part of her was a lot quieter than it had been. Because she did\nbelong. This was her operation. And though this man was stronger than she\nwas, he was only a common brute. Training beat strength.\nShe shifted, then let go of the rifle and stepped out with her left leg,\nshifting the man’s weight—and force. As he stumbled, she wrenched out\nfrom his grip, rotated around behind him, then slammed his face down into\nthe counter.\nShe recovered her rifle, sparing a glance for Moonlight, who was"

She’d disarmed her guard, but he’d in turn pressed her against\nthe wall. As Marasi took that in, the wall distorted and a door popped into\nexistence behind Moonlight.\nMarasi barely caught sight of the stamp in Moonlight’s hand as the door\nopened, and the woman fell backward through it—surprising the guard,\nwho cried out as she pulled him down with her. Moonlight elbowed him in\nthe face to cut off his cry, so Marasi finished off her guard with a rifle butt\nto the face, then turned to deal with the scientist, who was …\nDestroying evidence? Marasi cursed and scrambled over to the woman\nand pulled her away from the trash can where she’d started a fire. Marasi\nkicked the trash can over, scattering charred notebooks and papers out of it.\n“Marasi!” Moonlight cried.\nRusts. The scientist had found a large knife and joined Moonlight’s\nfight. As Moonlight struggled to deal with the guard—who was trying to\ngrapple her—the scientist raised the knife.\nMaking a quick judgment, Marasi swung up her rifle and snapped off a\nshot, killing the scientist with a well-placed bullet. The sound echoed in the\ntunnels like a screamed condemnation. Someone would hear that for\ncertain.\nMoonlight finished off her guard with her own knife, then was cut off\nfrom view as the door she’d made vanished. Marasi sat on the floor and\ngroaned softly, the shimmering barrier of her slowness bubble just a foot\naway. She’d taken the risk to save people. She’d known what she was\ngetting into. But now their operation was jeopardized.\nSo don’t let it be wasted, she thought, hauling herself to her feet. As her\nslowness bubble came down, she pointed her rifle right at the two scientists.\n“Make one move to open that tin,” she said, “and I will kill you. I’m\nhaving a particularly bad day, so I wouldn’t test that threat.”\nThe scientist with the tin of poison gas tablets carefully set it down, then\nboth raised their hands and backed away. Moonlight entered a moment later\nand began binding them. TwinSoul stumbled in behind her, holding to the\ndoorframe for stability.\n“I appear to have run afoul of your powers,” he said to Marasi.\n“Sorry about that,” she said.\n“I note two disabled guards,” he said. “And one dead scientist. So the\noperation went well?”\n“Marasi had to shoot one,” Moonlight said, pulling one of the scientists’\nbonds tight, “to save me. I ruined it.”\n“No,” Marasi said. “It was my fault for not helping fast enough.”\n“It is done,” TwinSoul said. “We should see to the captives and secure\nan exit. What are those burned pages?”\n“They destroyed evidence,” Marasi said. “I assume about how they were\naccomplishing the Hemalurgy. I wasn’t able to save it, so…”\nMoonlight sniffed. “Looks like the cover of a book there. You saved that\nmuch.”\n“But none of the writings,” Marasi said.\n“I can rewind that later,” Moonlight said, “with a stamp.” She grabbed"

We\nshould probably begin our extraction—that gunshot will bring people\nrunning.”\n“Extraction?” Marasi said. “Entrone said he was going to help an\ninvading force attack. Moonlight, can enemy troops really reach us from …\nanother world?”\n“They’re probably coming through Shadesmar,” Moonlight said. “A\ndimension overlapping ours. It’s how TwinSoul and I got here.”\n“Autonomy has access to … some very specialized troops,” TwinSoul\nsaid. “Hard to control. Dangerous to unleash. I know their destructive\npower personally. While I’m more frightened of that bomb, an invasion by\nAutonomy’s forces could also be catastrophic. Fortunately, the local\nperpendicularity—the portal to reach this world—is far to the south and\ncarefully controlled.”\n“There’s no other way?” Marasi asked.\nThe two shared a look.\n“There are planets,” Moonlight said, “where Autonomy has created such\nportals unexpectedly, and against all understood mechanics. I wouldn’t be\nsurprised if she’s done that here, or is soon going to. Providing a means for\nher armies to attack.”\nSo if Wax succeeded in stopping the bomb, there would be an invasion\ninstead. Marasi took a deep breath. Even more reason they couldn’t run—\nnot until they knew what was happening with that army. For now though,\nshe unlocked and yanked open the cell door, spilling light across the ragged\nprisoners. They pulled back from the light like mistwraiths in the night.\n“I’m Marasi Colms,” she said, fishing her credentials from her pocket.\n“Elendel Constabulary.”\n“Oh, thank the Survivor!” a man said, stumbling forward and taking her\nhand. His suit had once been nice, and he had a few tufts of hair on an\notherwise bald head. Did she … recognize him?\n“You’re in Bilming politics,” she said. “You served as the local advisor\nto the Senate.”\n“Y-yes,” he stuttered. “Pielle Fromed. I was head of the opposition party\nfor the Bilming Council. I still am … I think…”\nMost of the others looked like ordinary citizens, but there was a\nTerriswoman in the rear with kinky hair. That was … yes, she was a major\nnewspaper owner, wasn’t she? Editor of the Seasons? Marasi had been\ninterviewed by her staff the other year … It was a newspaper that had been\nsympathetic to Elendel interests.\nPreservation … Entrone hadn’t merely been experimenting on his\ncitizens, he’d been experimenting on his political opposition. It was\nshockingly brazen. How had he made these people vanish without anyone\ngetting wind of it?\nThe editor of the Seasons accepted Marasi’s help as Moonlight ushered\nthe captives into the main room. “Listen,” the woman said. “I think they\nhave an army of some sort! I’ve … I’ve been taking notes…”\nShe almost fainted as Marasi helped her stand. But she pressed a\nnotebook into Marasi’s hands. “There isn’t much. But you must believe\nme.”"

But you must believe\nme.”\n“I do,” Marasi said. “We’re here to stop them.”\n“Locate a place they call the Community,” she said. “I think it’s where\ntheir barracks are.”\n“We’ll stop them,” Marasi promised, leading her to the others. “We have\nto get these people out of here,” Marasi then said to TwinSoul.\n“Immediately.”\nTogether, the three of them ushered the poor captives along. They were\nslow, they were tired, and they were underfed. It took a dangerously long\ntime to get them all into the tunnel. And as Marasi was preparing to lead\nthem back toward the elevators, she heard noises from that direction.\nWith a sinking feeling, she saw a good two dozen guards—soldiers,\nreally; probably the ones who had been standing watch in the building\nabove—come piling around the turn in the tunnel.\nThis had just gone from quiet infiltration to full-on war.\n51\nThe Set soldiers, spotting Marasi’s group, immediately organized in the\ntunnel, using the natural curve as cover. Fortunately, this bought Marasi and\nher team a few precious moments—the enemy didn’t know what they were\nfacing, and so took up a defensive posture.\nMarasi ushered the former captives back toward the room, though the\nflimsy drywall would offer very little protection against gunfire.\nTwinSoul, however, knelt and put both hands on the ground.\n“Moonlight,” he said, “I’ll need extra fuel. Water will not be enough for\nthis.”\nShe swiftly dug out one of the glowing jars and tossed it to him. A line\nof crystal grew from him and around the jar, opening the top. His crystals\nbegan to grow faster—in moments he’d created a chest-high wall of roseite\nin front of them.\nGunfire rang out from the other end of the tunnel, making the former\ncaptives cry out as they crowded back into the room. Rifle in hand, Marasi\nthrew herself against TwinSoul’s improvised fortification next to\nMoonlight. She risked a glance over the roseite mound—he’d made this one\nopaque, perhaps to give the enemy less information.\nShe ducked back down as a bullet blasted a few chips off the front of the\nfortification. TwinSoul clearly had to concentrate to keep this large a barrier\nup. He had settled down with his legs crossed and his hands in fists,\nknuckles pressed together in front of him, his head bowed. The crystal-\nstone had grown up over his arms in an odd way. Marasi turned to\nMoonlight.\n“Can you make a door in the ground?” Marasi said. “There might be\ntunnels beneath us.”\nMoonlight shook her head. “Even if there were, the thickness of the\nstone would be far too great for my stamp.”\n“I believe, my lady Marasi,” TwinSoul said, “that you should allow me\nto take the people we’ve freed and hasten them to the exit. It seems these\nsoldiers were guarding the shipping bay above. So if I can push through\nthem, I can get the civilians to safety.”\n“That would be good,” Moonlight said. “Marasi and I can escape farther"

You can’t manage them on\nyour own. No offense, but you can barely walk down a corridor without\nsupport.”\n“No offense taken,” he said, his voice muffled as the roseite continued\nto grow up—and for some reason around him. “But in return … No offense,\nmy lady, but you might perhaps be underestimating Silajana.”\nThe roseite completely encased him, forming a transparent boulder\naround him. His head bowed, with formal sash in place, he was still fully\nvisible in his cross-legged posture through the rose-colored stone. Marasi\nfrowned as it continued to expand rapidly. The size and speed of this\ncreation seemed to need the help of the glowing substance from the jar,\nwhich was being drained as the roseite grew.\nBulges formed at the sides of the boulder, like … smaller boulders?\nOnly longer. Then two more formed on the bottom rear of the boulder.\nMarasi cocked her head, her back to the fortification mound, rifle across her\nknees. Actually, with the smaller boulder forming on the top, it had almost\ntaken on the shape of … of a …\nThick stone fingers formed on the ends of the two protrusions at the\nsides, then massive roseite arms spread out, stone grinding against the stone\nground as the lower parts formed knees and feet. TwinSoul at the center, the\nthing heaved itself up—a twelve-foot-tall stone behemoth. The crystal\ndidn’t bend, but had formed joints, like armor.\nA man made of rock, like some mythological creature, with a head on\nthe top, broad shoulders, and trunklike legs. TwinSoul sat at its heart, legs\ncrossed, fists pressed together in front of him. But his head rose and his\neyes snapped open, glowing softly, as his creation ripped free of the lines of\nroseite connecting it to the ground.\nThe fortification started to disintegrate right away, but the soldiers’\nattention was totally focused on the stone monstrosity that advanced, its\nhead scraping the top of the tunnel. Their gunfire intensified, bullets hitting\nwith a pop and spray of stone. TwinSoul barely seemed to mind. He stepped\nin front of Marasi and moved his construct’s hands in front of him, growing\nsomething out of them.\n“Behold!” he said, his voice somehow booming through the tunnel. “By\nthe grace of Silajana, Suna, Vishwadhar, and the Twelve Primal Aethers, I\nam Sanvith Prasanva Maahik va Sila, Grand Aetherbound of the twelve\nkingdoms, Raj of the Coriander Court. And these people are under my\nprotection.”\nTo punctuate his words, a colossal mace finished forming from roseite in\nhis stone fingers—with a huge bulb at one end, like that of a tulip. He let it\nthump to the rock beneath him, shaking the ground."

Others up and ran. Chips blasted off the\nconstruct, but the holes filled in immediately. The jar of pure Investiture—\nstill half full—had been overgrown by the roseite and was near the rear of\nthe large stone figure, its glow illuminating TwinSoul from behind.\n“Silajana demands that I warn you,” he announced, “you have been\ngiven this rebirth to bless, encourage, and uplift those around you. By your\nactions here, you prove this gift wasted. If you are destroyed today by\nresisting my defense of these innocents, you reject your great blessing—and\nmay not be given rebirth again for many, many centuries. Lay down your\nweapons and let us pass, or suffer my wrath.”\nHe certainly had a way with words. Moonlight grabbed Marasi by the\nshoulder, gesturing for them to retreat past the building with the hiding\ncivilians. For the moment however, Marasi remained rooted, amazed by the\nsight of TwinSoul’s construct raising the mace.\n“It appears,” he announced, “that my offer has been rejected. In turn,\nyour offer of conflict is accepted. Prepare yourselves!” With that, he\ncharged down the corridor, each footstep making the ground tremble.\nMarasi finally allowed Moonlight to pull her back. In the flimsy\nstructure—over the cacophony of gunfire, screams, and the impact of stone\non stone—they told the captives to arm themselves, then follow TwinSoul\nto the way out.\nThen Marasi and Moonlight exited and hurried down the main corridor,\nfinding a darkened side passage to slip through. Hopefully, this would let\nthem avoid any reinforcements that might come up the main passage.\n“Will he be able to get them out, do you think?” Marasi whispered as—\nusing light from one of the two remaining jars—they made their way\nthrough the tunnel complex. Marasi spotted a sign pointing toward THE\nCOMMUNITY.\n“TwinSoul is the best chance they have,” Moonlight replied. “I think he\ncan manage it. He has the pure Investiture—and as long as that holds, he’ll\nbe nigh invincible. He can shrink and grow his juggernaut as he needs, to\nget through smaller corridors. If they try to cut the electricity, he can even\npush the elevator all the way to the top—or create a new one from roseite.”\nMore gunfire sounded from behind. Marasi hoped it was the civilians\narming themselves and firing to protect their retreat. She was certain she\nheard more footfalls and shouts coming from the main tunnel.\nMoonlight looked back and smiled. “Don’t worry,” she said. “He’ll be\nfine. And this is exactly what we need. Prasanva is an absolute artist at\ndrawing attention when he sets his mind to it.”\n“You willing to keep going forward?” Marasi asked.\n“If there really is a perpendicularity here,” she said, “then … yes. As\nmuch as I want to get out with this information, protecting the planet must\ncome first.” She hesitated. “I’m new to this large-scale sort of thinking.\nSpent a long time looking out for myself and my own goals.

Sorry if I come\noff as terse or too quick to want to retreat.”\nMarasi nodded, noting some light up ahead. She slipped forward quietly,\nand Moonlight covered up the jars in her rucksack. Together they\napproached another tunnel, lit with mining lights. The natural tunnel\nvanished to the right, but to the left the stone had a different cast to it.\nMarasi pointed at the jagged sections of rock on the ceiling and walls.\n“They blasted here,” she whispered. “This is a section they opened up\nand expanded.”\nMoonlight pointed to another sign. The Community, whatever it was,\ncould be found this way. Marasi held out hope that Gave and the Set\nweren’t quite so zealous as to let Autonomy’s armies in. He’d sounded\nhesitant, at least. Smarmy as the man was, even he realized this was\nextreme. But he also had seemed worn down. As if he felt he couldn’t fight\nor resist.\nAs they snuck farther along the blasted-out tunnel, Marasi was pulled\nout of her thoughts. Were those sounds coming from the tunnel behind\nthem? Something following them?\nMoonlight seemed to hear the sounds too, because she turned and\nglanced that direction. They shared a look, then hurried forward, hoping to\nstay ahead of whatever it was.\n52\nAs Wax and Wayne neared the end of the tunnel, Wax noticed his friend\nsniffling and trailing behind. In the light streaming through the holes in a\npassing manhole cover, Wax saw that Wayne had sudden bags under his\neyes.\n“This might not be the best time to store up health,” Wax whispered\nsoftly.\n“I’m runnin’ low,” Wayne mumbled. “I feel like I’m gonna need every\nbit I can store. That, or I’ll die one of these times somebody shoots me.\nThat’s right terrifying, it is. Don’t know how you all deal with it.” He\npaused. “If we get inna fight, I’ll stop. Just need to squeeze a little extra in\nduring breathers, you know.”\nWax didn’t say anything. This was more a matter of comfort to Wayne\nthan anything practical. Wayne wouldn’t be able to store up much in the\ntime they had. It took a Feruchemist months storing health to get a full\nmetalmind.\nThe tire tracks stopped at the end of the tunnel, where the giant concrete\ntube dumped out over the ocean. Wax was used to the relatively sheltered\nand calm waters of the Elendel docks—where the waves were so placid,\nyou could be on a large lake. Here on the promontory that Bilming\noccupied, the waters chopped and churned, crashing against the docks. No\nwonder the Bilming navy was made up of such hulking metal monstrosities.\nHe could see them in a row in the near distance, six terrible petrol-powered\nwarships, each larger than the one before.\nIt was strange to think that, even combined, they posed an insignificant\nthreat compared to the bomb Wax was hunting. All that work to create\nweapons of war, invalidated by a single discovery.\nHe gestured to a final hatch and ladder, which must lead to the lab. As"

All that work to create\nweapons of war, invalidated by a single discovery.\nHe gestured to a final hatch and ladder, which must lead to the lab. As\nsoon as he and Wayne emerged onto a street by the docks, a door slammed\nnearby. Wax spun, scanning the warehouses.\n“There,” Wayne said, pointing. “Third one down. Someone was\nwatchin’ out the window too.”\nThe two glanced at each other, then took cover as gunfire exploded from\nthe window. Conventional bullets and guns, his steelsight told him.\nNo aluminum weapons, Wax thought. They sent those Allomancers to try\nto deal with us, but didn’t have time to otherwise prepare. We might finally\nbe ahead of them.\nHe increased his weight with his metalmind, then Pushed the next round\nof gunfire away—flinging the bullets back through the wooden walls and\nglass windows. Curses followed, giving him and Wayne a chance to\nscramble closer. Wayne nodded, so Wax increased his weight and hit the\nentire building with a Steelpush, anchoring himself from behind.\nThe wall shook, and a section was ripped free by its nails and a window\nhousing. Wayne leaped in through the hole and dropped a few gunmen\ninside. Wax followed with Vindication raised, three precise shots bringing\ndown the gunmen Wayne couldn’t reach. As they fought, a truck revved its\nengine and barreled out on the other side of the warehouse, tires screeching.\nWax caught sight of two others ahead of it. A small convoy escaping into\nthe evening.\nA quick survey of the large room told him an entire story. Laboratory\ndesks and machinery, stripped bare in a frenzy. Debris on the floor. Torn\ncorners of paper still stapled to the wall where charts or schematics had\nbeen hastily ripped down. Dangling chains indicated that something had\nbeen constructed here, built in the center of those desks.\nThey hadn’t expected Wax to dare raid the Silver House or find the\ntunnel. He was only one step behind now.\nWax launched himself after the truck, decreasing his weight and flying\nthrough the large garage doors to track the truck as it screeched around\nanother corner, nearly toppling in its haste.\nWayne would take care of the stragglers. Wax needed to know what was\nin those trucks.\nHe roared into the air in a rush, gaining height, and spotted the last of\nthe three trucks heading back into the heart of the city. He’d spent the whole\nday running to catch up, to tease together plots that had been in motion for\nyears. He was tired of half answers, of feeling like he was a hundred steps\nbehind his sister.\nNow he had solutions in sight. Those trucks held real answers, perhaps\neven the bomb itself. He’d be damned to an eternal pit of ash before he let\nthem get away.\nHe Pushed off a manhole cover, gaining more height. From there,\nstreetlamps—which were just starting to come on as the sun neared the\nhorizon—became his anchors, like stepping stones across a lake. He Pushed\non a pair at a time for lift and momentum, then began using buildings as\nenormous anchors. Then a moving car, to gain even more speed, borrowing\nits momentum."

Then a moving car, to gain even more speed, borrowing\nits momentum.\nAir became a whistle, then a roar around him—his mistcoat tassels\nwhipping and snapping. His furious pace let him gain on the three trucks,\neven as they moved at speed on the highway. He had almost reached the last\none in line when a slot opened in the back door and the barrels of several\nautomatic rifles—aluminum—peeked out.\nThey’d saved the good weapons for themselves as they fled. A hail of\naluminum bullets followed. Wax moved by instinct. His pursuit so far had\nbeen too direct, making him an easy target.\nHe dodged to the side as the bullets cracked in the air. He lurched away\nfrom the highway over cars full of startled civilians, then between two\nbuildings to give him cover. There he ground to a stop, boots on asphalt,\ntassels falling still around him.\nThis isn’t right, he thought. His path following the trucks had been ob-\nvious, but their path along the highway was more so. Could they be playing\nhim yet again? He launched himself off a bullet, then gained speed by\nPushing against the buildings to the sides, rattling windows—cracking a\nfew as he warped their metal housings.\nIn Elendel, he had to hold himself back. Moderate his actions to\nminimize property damage. But Harmony had set Wax on this path, and you\ndidn’t bring Dawnshot out of retirement to play nice. The lives of millions\nwere at stake.\nHe’d break a few windows to stop it. Hell, he’d break a few necks. He\nbarreled up over cars, ignoring the cries of startled pedestrians as he moved\nparallel to the highway—trying to gain enough speed to catch up to the\nenemy truck, but keeping buildings between him and it. At the right\nmoment he ducked back out, shattering windows, and darted across the\nhighway—finding the third truck exactly where he’d hoped it would be.\nIt was in a pack of civilian vehicles, so Wax dodged behind cover again\nand followed, parallel, for another minute. He soared down that side street,\nfeeling … alive. Propelled by steel, a bullet in flight. Perhaps he’d been\nwithout this for too long, and so had forgotten the rush, but he felt more in\ncontrol than he ever had before.\nHave to stop that truck slowly, he thought. In case the bomb is inside.\nHe assumed the device couldn’t be detonated simply by being jostled—his\nexperiment the other day had shown that the real explosion required specific\nmechanical intervention. But he had to be careful regardless.\nAt the next intersection, he glanced right and saw what he’d hoped to\nsee: the truck, in its haste to stay ahead of him, had pulled away from the\npack of civilian vehicles into a more open stretch of the highway.\nWax darted in, over the edge of the highway, and increased his weight\ntenfold. He slowed in the air as a result, and hit the side of the passing truck\nwith a Steelpush, grinding it into the highway’s sidewall. It jostled more\nthan he would have liked, but it did slow.\nWax changed trajectory, staying alongside the truck, forcing it into the"

It jostled more\nthan he would have liked, but it did slow.\nWax changed trajectory, staying alongside the truck, forcing it into the\nsidewall until its tires burst and it stopped. He hit the ground near the\nbroken rear door, sighting three unsteady gunmen within. He took them out,\nthen drilled a bullet right through the front wall of the truck, hitting the\ndriver in the back of the head. But other than those people, the truck was\nempty.\nIt was a decoy.\nDamn it!\nHe launched back into the air, Pushing off the truck, bending and\nwarping the crumpled roof as he sought height. Such a Push could only take\nhim up so far—the farther you went from your anchor, the less force you\ncould Push upon it.\nHe reached the zenith of what his anchor could provide and spun,\nscanning the city below, searching for …\nThere. The second truck was racing along the highway ahead. He almost\ndarted straight for it. But …\nThree trucks. At least one decoy. He spotted another far ahead, on the\nstraightaway. This was too easy. They were so visible on a highway like\nthis; they could keep his attention, draw him away from …\nHe hovered there, still Pushing, holding himself upright—though wind\nbegan to blow him to the side, upsetting his anchor. As he began to lose\naltitude …\n… he spotted it. A fourth truck with the same markings, winding its way\nthrough the side streets perpendicular to the highway. It was heading\ninward, toward the center of the city. He barely glimpsed it as it moved\nbehind some buildings.\nThat was the one he needed to catch. He left the others, hoping his\ninstincts were right, and dropped into the city. He slowed with a Push on the\ntop of a parked automobile, cracking the windshield with his weight, then\nwarped the hood as he landed. He launched forward through the center of a\npark, scattering a flock of ravens, then bounded up the side of a building—\nbarely reaching the top as his Push gave out.\nThere was an invigorating thrill to the motion. The city was so full of\nmetal, so packed with obstacles. In a chase, each could be an advantage.\nWax could soar over buildings, get height, track the vehicle—and gain on it,\nas the truck had to keep to the roads and deal with traffic.\nWax dropped over the side of a building, then propelled himself between\ntwo others with the force of a swimmer pushing off the wall at the start of a\nlap. He swept around corners and almost seemed to be able to ride the cries\nof the people below, like a bird riding thermals in the desert.\nChases in the Roughs had their own charm. But nothing there could\ntruly compete with the thrill of landing inside a building via the balcony,\ncharging through, and emerging on the other side to find his quarry right\nbelow. A balcony railing was a springboard, and nearby structures let him\nfine-tune his descent.\nHere, he could fly in a way he’d never been able to in that land of dust\nand stone. He could acknowledge that—no, embrace it—now that he had\nlet go of his past.\nThe people in the truck ahead pulled open another slot on the back door."

He could acknowledge that—no, embrace it—now that he had\nlet go of his past.\nThe people in the truck ahead pulled open another slot on the back door.\nWax sighted with Vindication, but not toward the window. Toward the door\nitself.\nHe plugged it with a hazekiller round, one with a secondary explosion\ndesigned to rip apart Hemalurgist bodies. It blasted the door to shrapnel and\nsplit open the rear of the truck. As the gunmen stumbled away, Wax got a\nview inside. No bomb, but a ton of boxes, ledgers, and documents.\nThat would have to do. He let the truck pull ahead as the gunmen started\nlaying down fire. Wax increased his weight and shoved on a grate below\nhim in the street—bending and twisting it out of the way as he dropped\nthrough and entered the storm drain tunnels again.\nHe twisted in the air, delivered two bullets into the tunnel wall behind\nhim, then Pushed off those—and the remnants of the grate that had plunged\ninto the mud—to send himself screaming through the tunnel right under the\nstreet.\nWax came out a second later, blasting a manhole cover off into the air.\nHe landed, one foot on either side of the open manhole, and increased his\nweight many hundreds of times—completely draining his metalmind. Then\nhe Pushed.\nHis feet skidded a few inches on the concrete.\nThe truck crumpled as if it had hit a solid wall, the front mashing like\ntinfoil, doing unfortunate things to the driver. The back end of the truck\nlurched up into the air, then slammed down, trailing loose-leaf pages. One\nof the wheels rolled completely free, straight through the front window of a\nnearby building. A liquor store, Wax noticed with a wince. Wayne would\nnot appreciate that.\nThe street fell quiet as other cars stopped, their drivers cowering in their\nseats or—more commonly—staring slack-jawed. Wax took a few deep\nbreaths, his pulse racing, his body electric. His mind …\nFocused on the job. He released another breath, and was surprised by\nhow calm he felt. A part of him … a part of him had worried about\nreturning to the field again. Worried that by experiencing these kinds of\nthrills, he’d view his normal life as mundane, lacking.\nIt didn’t happen. He could go on a chase like that through the city\nanytime he wanted in Elendel, as long as he wasn’t quite so flagrant about\nthe property damage. He could even bring Max along, and have someone to\nshare in the joy. He didn’t need this, not as he once had.\nWhat a wondrous thing that was to confirm. He took a deep breath, then\nrounded the truck.\n53\nMarasi and Moonlight were being hunted.\nSomething was back there, something that seemed not quite human. It\nmade a sound like nails or claws on stone, accompanied by unnatural\ngrowls. Marasi hurried through the blasted-out tunnel, Moonlight at her\nside, trying to balance their speed.

But if they slowed too much, then whatever was\nback there would catch up to them.\nSo they moved in fits, hurrying a distance they could see by the light of\nmining lamps, then pausing to scout out their next rush forward. This part\nof the tunnel complex was far more built up than the one they’d come from,\nwith many more turns. But they were able to follow the signs, heading ever\ncloser to the Community. They passed more drywall rooms, some clearly\noccupied, and they had to find improvised cover several times as groups of\npeople hurried past.\nThese weren’t soldiers though. Mostly workers or scientists. Judging by\ntheir whispered conversations, Entrone had ordered everyone to their\nquarters. There was a sense of frantic worry to the people—but also a\nsingle-minded anxiety. That helped, as they weren’t paying much attention\nto their surroundings.\nAs Marasi and Moonlight hid from one of these groups beside some\nboxes, Marasi worried the thing chasing them would catch up. Yet it was\ncreeping along, not rushing. Perhaps … perhaps it was hiding too?\nMoonlight eventually whispered for Marasi to wait, then ducked into a\nroom that—through the cracked door—seemed unoccupied. She emerged\nmoments later with two lab coats, and they started moving through the\ncorridor as though they belonged there. The disguises were flimsy, but no\none gave them a second glance, despite Marasi’s rifle.\nSoon, a voice echoed through the tunnel. “Stay calm. Don’t worry. I am\nin the Community making preparations for our new arrivals. I want all of\nyou to settle in and wait. This is what we’ve planned for; we are ready.”\nIt was Gave Entrone. His voice came from some speakers that lined the\nhallway—a technology that was becoming more common since its\ninvention a few years back.\nHearing his voice finally undermined Marasi’s hope that Gave would\nresist the invasion. This complex, the supplies … everything about it\nindicated the truth. This was a bunker, the launching point of an invasion—\nand a place for Entrone’s favorites to be protected from the coming\nannihilation.\nA haunting worry whispered this was only part of it. Marasi had to stop\nEntrone, but that wouldn’t protect Elendel from the bomb Telsin had trained\non it. For that, she had to trust that Wax and Wayne were fulfilling their half\nof the mission. Her duty was to deal with this oncoming army. The men of\ngold and red.\nThe tunnel eventually expanded to a large cavern. But curiously, the far\nwall was straight wood, from floor to ceiling. And it felt like that wall\nbisected the chamber—which, judging by the slope of the blasted-out\nceiling, was extremely large. The wooden wall had several darkened rooms\nbuilt up against it. Indeed, the entire chamber was silent and mostly dark, lit\nonly by a few emergency lights.\nMarasi and Moonlight stopped at the mouth of the cavern. Was this the\nCommunity? Why split the cavern like that? Whatever the reason, the order\nto quarters had been obeyed, and apparently any soldiers in the area had\ngone to deal with TwinSoul. That let Marasi and Moonlight enter the cavern\nalone.\nSoon after, those sounds came from behind again. Taking Moonlight by"

Taking Moonlight by\nthe shoulder, Marasi pulled them between two buildings beside the large\nwall. From this scant shelter, she watched as something entered the mouth\nof the cavern. It stood on four elongated legs and had an unnervingly long\nneck, with a head that wasn’t entirely canine. It had features that, even\nshadowed as they were, evoked an image that was … too human. A dog’s\nnose, or something approximating it, but human eyes set forward on its\nskull.\nIt had no clothing, but also no fur. Two spikeheads jutted from its\nshoulders. She’d heard of something like this before—Wax had encountered\nsomething similar in the tunnels beneath Elendel. Now, after studying the\nbook Death had given her, she recognized what it was. A Hemalurgic\nmonstrosity.\nOne use of the art was to create Metalborn. But the Lord Ruler had also\nused Hemalurgy to create twisted versions of human beings. The kandra\nhad arisen from that work, as had the koloss. Creating those had required\nprecision use of spikes—the knowledge of a god. If you tried to\napproximate such designs, you were likely to kill your subject. Or stumble\ninto some kind of half-creation. A twisted mutation, leaving a being’s soul\nmangled by the spikes.\nThe Set, it seemed, had found a permutation that was viable but\ngrotesque. The thing sniffed the air, then prowled carefully into the cavern.\nIt knew they were there. It paused where Marasi and Moonlight had stopped\nto inspect their surroundings—a spot that was barely thirty yards from their\ncurrent hiding place. The abomination made a hooting sound that echoed in\nthe cavern, and other voices—dozens of them—replied.\nMoonlight gripped Marasi’s shoulder, then pointed. She’d made a door\nin the side of the structure they’d been hiding by, and they slipped into a\ndim room built up against the wooden wall bisecting the chamber. Two\nwindows looked through it.\nMarasi didn’t have a good view through them, not from her corner next\nto Moonlight. The door vanished, and a few moments later scratches\nsounded at the wall they’d passed through. Silence followed, then a\nthumping at the main door. It held, for now.\nMarasi unslung her rifle, glanced at Moonlight, then nodded toward the\nwindows. Perhaps they could escape through those? She stepped over to\nlook through, and found … a town?\nNeat rows of houses lined streets within a vast chamber, bigger on that\nside than this one. It was lit from above with floodlights. Someone had\npainted imitation flowers and grass on the floor in wide swaths, and others\nhad erected sculptures meant to imitate foliage. People in everyday clothing\n—skirts, trousers, day dresses—walked the “streets,” though there were no\nhorses or automobiles she could see.\n“What in Preservation’s name?” Marasi whispered. “I suppose … this is\nthe Community they built for themselves to escape the destruction above?”\nShe frowned. A short time ago, she might have theorized it was designed\nto withstand the second ashfall, but she was now mostly certain that was a"

A short time ago, she might have theorized it was designed\nto withstand the second ashfall, but she was now mostly certain that was a\nhoax. The bomb and the invading army were the true threats.\nBehind them, the thing stopped scratching at the door. She wasn’t\ncertain that was a good sign; it might have gone to get help.\n“There’s something off about this entire place,” Moonlight said. She\nrapped on the window. “I think this is one-way glass. See the tinting? And\nthose people in the next chamber? They don’t appear to have heard the\norder to quarters or the fighting. They’re too calm.”\n“We could still escape in there.”\n“Those twisted things will follow us,” Moonlight said. “The strain the\nSet has developed can track like a hound, but think almost like a person.”\n“Can we fight them?” Marasi said, checking her ammo.\n“I’m not … natively a soldier,” Moonlight said. “I can defend myself if I\nhave to, but…” She seemed concerned as she glanced toward the door.\nShouts came from outside. Troops arriving.\n“You have another stamp,” Marasi said. “One you said can transform\nyou.”\n“Into someone else,” she said. “Someone with a different past, different\ntraining, different … talents.”\n“Can that person fight?”\nMoonlight took a deep breath. “Yes. Better than fighting though, she\nshould be able to vanish. Hide. But the person I would become … she\nwouldn’t be me. I’ve always wanted to try this specific transformation,\nMarasi, which is why I have the stamp. But it’s dangerous.\n“This one won’t wear off as easily as the others—it will be permanent\nuntil I decide not to maintain it. And when I’m someone else, stamped like\nthis, I don’t think the same. One of these times, I’ll change and never come\nback. Yet, with the jar of pure Investiture as a power source … I can try\nthis. I can really try it.”\nMoonlight dug out the stamp, then stared at it with the same air Marasi\nhad seen in Wax when cleaning one of his guns.\n“You’re telling me,” Marasi said, “that transforming yourself into\nanother person isn’t magic?”\nMoonlight grimaced. “All right. I’ll admit those ones feel more\nmystical. It all makes sense if you understand the Dor…”\nMarasi glanced through the window, then back at the front door. Shouts\nwere converging outside. Rusts … it sounded like a lot of soldiers. Marasi\nraised her gun, then hesitated.\n“Those monsters track through scent. What if you made me a door in\nthis wall, and I jumped through? Next, you could distract them—make a big\nfight of it—then vanish, like you say. They might not know what happened\nto me; they might assume we both ran.”\n“That’s a solid plan,” Moonlight said. She took a deep breath. “All right.\nI have wanted to try this. I intended to convince Kell to give me some of\nthat Investiture so I could. Never thought I’d be using this in the field\nthough. I can fight them in this form, but that would leave you alone.”"

I can fight them in this form, but that would leave you alone.”\n“I can’t just run, Moonlight,” Marasi said. “It’s my fault we drew those\ntroops. Beyond that, the Basin is my home. I can’t leave it to Entrone and\nhis plans.”\nMoonlight nodded sharply. “Let’s do it. I should have an advantage, as\nthey might come after me with batons and bayonets. Too much gunfire\ncould disturb whatever they’re doing in that Community. You’ll notice the\nSet hasn’t done the smart thing here, which would be shooting up this entire\nroom with prejudice.”\n“Forward then,” Marasi said.\nMoonlight dug something from her sack, a little device that she read\nsome numbers from. “If I ask, give me the distance twenty-seven sixty-\nthree, inclination twelve degrees. And show me this map.” She held out a\nnotebook. “I don’t have time to explain why.” She popped the top off the jar\nof Investiture, then dipped her stamp into that light and used it on the wall\n—making the door for Marasi. “That should make it hold longer than\nusual.” Then she held the other stamp to her wrist. “I hoped to have Kelsier\nhere to pull me out if things went wrong. You might have to reexplain to me\nwhy I need to fight those soldiers.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“I might not have all my memories,” Moonlight said. “This will\ncompletely rewrite my past. My soul will think my parents moved to a\ndifferent kingdom on my homeworld, and that I was born and raised there. I\nwill change personalities entirely. I wrote it all out, but … well, I’m never\nquite sure how an Essence Mark will function until I try.”\n“Wait,” Marasi said. “You didn’t mention that part of—”\nMoonlight pressed the stamp down on her wrist.\nThen began to transform.\n54\nUnlike TwinSoul—who had tapped the pure Investiture like a keg, drawing\nit forth slowly as he needed it—Moonlight took the entire jug in one\nmetaphoric slurp, sticking her hand into it and drawing it in. Her hair shrank\nto a bob and became luminous. Incredibly, her skin managed to outshine it\n—glowing from within like her core was ablaze. But with a white fire\nsomehow far more pure than any worldly flame.\nPower swirled around Moonlight, and she even appeared to rise off the\nground, though she was simply up on her tiptoes. She let out a long,\nsatisfied sigh, then turned to Marasi. Glowing like some divinity of lore. A\nbeing of radiant energy. She smiled through too-perfect lips, blessed from\nwithin by her natural brilliance.\nThe glow started to fade almost immediately, but she knelt on the\nground and began drawing with her finger. She consulted the map, and the\nnotations on it that Marasi showed her. She nodded, and light flooded from\nher, leaving a traced image on the ground. It looked a little like the map—a\nquick sketch of the Basin, but with a strange rune at the center.\nOnce she finished, her light stabilized, then brightened. She sighed in\nsatisfaction again and stood in the center of the circular drawing of light."

How curious.” She\nclasped her hands behind her back, humming softly to herself. When she\nnoticed Marasi gaping at her, she looked to one side, then the other. “Ah.\nDid you have a boon to request of me, child? Something I can do for you?”\n“There are soldiers outside,” Marasi said, pointing as the door began to\nthump and crack. “Who want us dead.”\n“Bother,” Moonlight said, then began moving her hands in the air,\ndrawing a complex network of lines that hung and glowed there. She\nfinished with a flourish, and the lines faded into the wall, which stopped\ncracking, despite the people pounding on it.\n“Who are they?” Moonlight said. “Nasties from the Rose Empire? Or\nanother group of Wyrn’s faithful, come to waste their time trying to fight\ntheir betters?”\n“Uh,” Marasi said, “they’re just bad people. We had a plan to—”\n“We?” Moonlight asked.\n“You and I, before you changed.”\n“I have always been Shay-I,” she said, gesturing. “Blessed of the Shay-\node.”\nRiiiight. Okay.\n“O blessed one,” Marasi said, trying something else, “your power is\nincredible, and your being divine. Please, will you grant me a boon?”\n“Why, of course!” she said, perking up. “So polite! A rare quality in\nmortals.”\n“I need to escape through that door,” Marasi said, pointing to the one in\nthe rear wall, “which will soon vanish.

I’d need distance and inclination…”\n“Oh,” Marasi said. “Twenty-seven sixty-three, inclination twelve\ndegrees? But can you really vanish—”\n“Fine, fine. But if you flee through that door, they’ll find only me in\nhere. An imperfect solution, devised by someone with poor planning skills.\nHere.”\nShe tapped Marasi on the forehead, then drew some symbols in the air\nwith one hand. A second later a duplicate of Marasi appeared, made with\nsome of Moonlight’s power. It started moving, though when Marasi tried to\ntouch it, her fingers passed right through. That made it even more\nunnerving.\n“Are you still here?” Moonlight said. “Scoot along, scoot along. Shay-I"

I’ll deal with these, then make a great show of\nvanishing. Be certain to deliver the proper offerings for the blessing I’ve\nmagnanimously gifted you, and be pious in your treatment of your gods.”\n“Yup,” Marasi said. “Pious. I’ll be pious.” She stepped toward the door,\nthen paused, noticing the last jar of light in the rucksack. She took the bag\n—which seemed to have some other useful equipment in it too—but handed\nMoonlight the burned notebook and leather folio of stamps.\n“You’ll want these later, great one,” Marasi said. “They’re very\nimportant. Please take them and keep them safe.”\n“Fine, fine,” she said, then shooed Marasi away with one hand, waving\ntoward the breaking lines on the wall—which was being pounded in force\nnow—with the other. “Hurry. They are almost through.”\nMarasi threw the rucksack over her shoulder and—with regret—left her\nrifle. She needed to be inconspicuous, so the pistol she stashed in the\nrucksack would have to do. She also left the lab coat, counting on her\nclothing—still that of a common delivery driver, intended to blend in with\nthe workers for the Set—to conceal her.\nShe then pushed through the door. As she closed it, she glimpsed\nMoonlight standing beside the Marasi doppelganger, drawing lines of light\nin the air with both hands as the far wall buckled and began to break.\nMarasi ducked away from the windows—which were indeed one-way\nglass, disguised on this side as part of a large checkerboard pattern. She\nthrew the rucksack over her shoulder and slipped into the peaceful\nneighborhood, hoping that this strange version of Moonlight would stick to\nthe plan.\n55\nIn the back of the truck, Wax found a mess of papers and equipment. And\nthree corpses.\nFeeling a grim sense of purpose, Wax climbed in and checked each of\nthe corpses—just in case they were feigning. He stopped before the final\none. She was bloodied but breathing, and when her eyes slipped open there\nwas a faint red glow to them.\n“Ah,” she said in a rasping voice. “You are good at this. We thought we\nhad taken enough precautions. Yet here you are. Breathing down our neck.\nSuch drive. Such individualism. A shame that Harmony got you first.”\nWax backed away, leveling the gun at her.\n“This body soon expires,” the creature said. “You need not concern\nyourself.”\n“What are you?”\n“You know what I am,” she whispered.\n“Trell.”\n“Your sister becomes Trell,” the thing whispered. “The name and\nmythology I prepared for her to adopt. But she has not achieved it yet. And\nI am not Trell. Rare is it that I speak to one directly as I do you.”\n“Autonomy,” he whispered.\n“Yes. Pierced by my metal.

I will not intervene against you and your efforts. Your sister does not\nunderstand this, Sword of Harmony. She pleads with me to act, but cannot\nsee: It is only in the struggle to survive that a person—a people—achieves\ntheir potential.”\n“This city,” he said. “Everything in it. This is your fault.”\n“It is the fault of those who strive for more,” Autonomy said. “And to\ntheir credit in the accomplishment. Though, I do not think your sister\nunderstands the nature of true Autonomy yet. Her attempts have a …\nfabricated, forced uniqueness to them. Not the raw wounds of true\nindividualism.\n“She will learn. The longer she holds the power, the longer she becomes\nan avatar of my nature, the more she will see and understand. If she\nsurvives. You should be proud of her. Though she flirts with her own\ndestruction, her efforts have kept this world alive. I would have attacked it\nyears ago otherwise.”\nWax frowned, stepping closer. “Where is the bomb?”\n“Aaah. It is not the bomb you should worry about. It is the destruction I\nhave sent if that bomb fails.”\n“I think you’re bluffing,” Wax said.\n“Think what you wish. But you yourself know the strength—the\ncapacity—one has in those moments before death. It is when the soul is\npushed to the limit that true exceptionalism manifests. And so, there must\nbe a consequence—as final and terrible as death—for failure.”\n“And what must we do,” Wax said, “to get you to leave us the hell\nalone?”\nAutonomy’s bloody lips smiled. “Prove you deserve it.” She closed her\neyes. And the body stopped breathing.\nRusts. Could he believe a word of what Autonomy had said? Could he\nrisk ignoring it? Either way, it left him more rattled than the chase had.\nHe quickly began digging through the papers in the back of the truck\nanyway. He found much of it chopped to shreds, then soaked in buckets of\nwater. They’d been trying to prevent him from getting the information.\nFortunately, he found a notebook that was only halfway soaked and\nbegan flipping through, reading records of test launches. Rusts … these\n“self-propelled rockets” could travel thirty or forty miles. How had they\nlaunched them without anyone knowing?\nThe ships, Wax realized. That’s why they built the navy—so they could\ntest weapons out on the ocean. The notes confirmed it. He checked the dates\nof the latest test.\nThey matched the dates of Gave’s “vacation.” They’d sailed out into the\nocean to run tests. But the rockets had failed, or at least they hadn’t\nperformed to desired levels. They couldn’t quite reach Elendel—though the\nnotebook was full of ideas to get them to go the little farther they needed.\nHe put together everything of use he could find, then shoved it in a\nduffel bag he found near the corner. He had so little time to make sense of\nthis, but surely somewhere in all this mess was a hint of where to find the\nbomb."

The man stood outside, mourning his shattered window.\nThough Wax should have been on his way, he hesitated, then walked\nover and pressed some cash into the man’s hand. “Sorry,” he said. “Trying\nto prevent a catastrophe.”\nThe man gaped at the money, but before he could reply, Wax spotted\nsomething just inside the broken window.\n“Hey,” he said. “Is that a case of Logshine?”\n* * *\nA short time later, Wax touched down at the laboratory where he’d left\nWayne. As he’d hoped, the younger man had dealt with the enemies, even\ntying a few up. Now Wayne had settled down with a handkerchief that had\nsomeone else’s initials on it and was wiping his nose. He looked miserable.\nWax had never been forced to store health, so he could only imagine\nhow it felt—particularly in the middle of a job. And now that the thrill of\nthe chase was over, Wax was tired. Rusts, he shouldn’t join investigations\nwithout any sleep. He wasn’t twenty anymore.\nHe walked over to Wayne, who blinked up at him. Then Wax raised two\nbottles of Logshine, a beer brewed in the Roughs—best there was.\n“Rusts, Wax,” Wayne said. “Where did you find those?”\n“Amazing what comes up in the line of duty,” he said, handing one to\nWayne.\n“I ain’t had a bottle of Logshine in years.” The man actually teared up.\n“You … Rusts, mate. You really do care about me, don’t you?”\n“I think it’s time,” he said to Wayne, “that we take a bit of a breather.”\n“Can we afford to?”\n“I need to dig through what I found,” Wax said. “And if we keep\nrunning into fights exhausted, we’ll get ourselves killed. I think we can\nspare a half hour or so. Sound good?”\n“Good?” Wayne said. “It sounds rusting amazing.”\n56\nSneaking through this strange cavern unseen proved impossible for Marasi.\nThe floodlights on the ceiling left little in the way of shadows, and the\nhomes were built around a central park—including fake grass made of some\nwood chips painted green. Nothing would be more conspicuous than\nsomeone being furtive.\nSo, feeling utterly exposed and half expecting to hear gunshots, she\nwalked down one of the picturesque rows of townhouses. Trying to pretend\nshe belonged. After the urgency of rushing from one fight to another, it felt\nsurreal.\nNo one in this cavern appeared to have any idea of the battles beyond it.\nShe passed couples walking hand in hand. A man worked on a play\nstructure in the yard of a home, his children eager for the swings to get\nconnected.

The buildings were made of brick\nor clay, no need for nails. The street had no lights or lanterns.\nIt was glaring once she noticed it. In fact, the only metal she was able to\nspot was in those floodlights high in the ceiling above. That made her even\nmore aware of the rucksack she carried. Aside from the glowing jar, Marasi\nhad some ammunition in it, and a few small explosive charges, along with\nbandages, cash, and some lockpicks and other tools. Moonlight was the\ntype of woman who liked to be prepared.\nMarasi pulled the sack tighter against her shoulder. Unfortunately, she\nwas drawing attention. People turned to watch her as she passed.\nConversations between promenading couples died. Eyes lingered on her, as\nif she were the one person on inspection day who’d neglected to wear a\nuniform.\nPerhaps best to hurry through this strange neighborhood and see if there\nwas some way out the other side. Yet would that actually help? Her intel\nsaid there was a way to the portal through the Community. She needed to\nfind it.\nThe lord mayor mentioned going to the Community, Marasi thought. He\ncould be in here somewhere. Maybe he would lead me to it?\nAs two women on the road passed by quickly, wearing day dresses and\nmoving at a brisk pace, they shot several furtive glances at Marasi. That\nposture … Marasi’s instincts said they were going to tell someone about\nher.\nThose same instincts told her to go the other direction. But … she\nneeded to find the people in charge. She almost asked Wayne what he\nthought, then felt like a fool. Over the years, she’d grown to rely on him.\nNot having him at her back … well, it felt wrong.\nAfter a split second of consideration, she broke into a trot to follow\nthose two women. They hurried into a two-story townhome with wooden\ntrestles along the wall outside, being climbed by painted ropes to imitate\nvines.\nMarasi peered in through the door and found the women clustered\naround not soldiers or officers, but a stately, middle-aged blonde woman.\nShe wore a fine grey-blue dress: short overcoat, long skirts with a slight\nbustle. It was a style that had been popular a decade ago. The stately woman\nmet Marasi’s eyes, then hurried over and took her by the arm.\nMarasi’s instinct was to dodge away, but it wasn’t a threatening move.\n“Hurry, hurry,” the woman said to Marasi. “Inside. You’ve already been\nseen by too many, dear. Drenya, close the drapes!”\nBefuddled, Marasi let the woman pull her into the well-furnished room\nas Drenya closed the drapes. The third woman lit an oil lamp on the table. It\nfelt … quaint to see it after years of electricity inexorably creeping into\nevery home and light sconce.\n“Fialia,” the stately woman said, “fetch the others. Kessi will want to\nmeet her, obviously. And Abrem. He has been keeping notes. Hurry, hurry!”\nShe then patted Marasi on the arm absently. “How are you, dear? Hungry?"

You must have had such a difficult time of it. You’re a survivor.\nGood for you.”\nDrenya peeked out through the now-closed drapes, watching. She was a\nmousy younger woman in a dress that could have used some more color. “I\ndon’t think Gord saw her, bless the Survivor.”\n“Word will get to him eventually,” Fialia said, pausing by the door.\n“He’ll go straight to the mayor.”\n“I’ll deal with Lord Entrone,” said the blonde woman, who settled\nMarasi in a seat. “Go!”\nFialia left and Marasi let herself be seated, trying to understand. They\ndidn’t want the mayor to find out about her, so were these dissenters within\nthe Set? But their clothing, these homes, this place …\nAnd this woman. The stately blonde patted Marasi’s hand, then vanished\ninto another room. Perhaps a kitchen? Marasi almost bolted. Perhaps they\nwere trying to distract her from stopping Mayor Entrone? But then the\nblonde woman returned with some biscuits and tea.\nMarasi gaped, flummoxed by the idea of a tea break in the middle of a\ndangerous incursion into enemy territory.\n“Look at the poor thing,” said Drenya from the drapes. “It’s probably\nbeen years since she saw real food.”\n“It’s all right,” the blonde woman said, offering the biscuits. “Don’t be\nafraid. We have plenty here—like in the old days. You remember?”\n“The … old days?” Marasi said.\n“Yes, before the disaster,” the blonde woman said. “Before the ashfalls.\nWe are safe down here.”\n“It was built to keep us protected,” the other woman said, stepping up.\n“You must be so strong to have survived up there, to have found your way\nhere.”\nUp there.\nOh, rusts. It finally came together for Marasi. All this time she’d\nassumed the pictures of ash falling, the strange moving image made with\nthe models above, was a part of a plot to threaten the outside world. But no.\nThe hoax hadn’t been planned to be used in the future; it had already been\nperpetrated. On these people.\nRusts. They thought the world had been destroyed. And that they had\nbeen protected from it.\n“How long,” Marasi whispered, “have you been down here?”\n“Seven years now,” the blonde woman said, patting her hand. “Though\nwe lived in much smaller caverns originally. This town—‘Wayfarer,’ as we\ncall it—is about five years old.”\n“It was terribly difficult to build,” the other woman added. “But it’s so\nmuch nicer. Makes you think of the old days, doesn’t it? With a sky and\nsunlight? Trees and plants?”\nMarasi numbly took a biscuit and bit into it, partly to keep the blonde\nwoman from forcing them on her. It was good, Marasi noticed absently as\nher mind raced. These people … they’d been tricked into believing the\nworld was ending. Forced to live in a bunker underground. But why? Surely"

Surely\nthe Set had plenty of willing participants in their schemes; why keep some\nof them so ignorant?

Three women and\none man, a stocky fellow with a belt full of stone tools.\n“No metal,” Marasi mumbled.\n“Well, naturally,” the blonde woman said. “The metal mutants can sense\nit. The only metal we dare use is a little aluminum to make lights and the\nspeakers for the public address system.”\nThe four others huddled, gaping at Marasi. Did she really look that\nmuch like she’d survived an apocalypse? She supposed her outfit was a\nlittle worse for wear, after multiple gunfights and struggles for her life. Plus\nthe rucksack, and having no chance to wash up …\nWell, maybe she did.\n“You poor people,” Marasi whispered.\n“She’s in shock,” said mousy Drenya.\n“Can you tell us what it’s like up there?” the man with the toolbelt said,\nstepping forward, a cloth cap in his fingers. “Are the ashfalls still strong?\nIt’s been a year since we saw an outsider.”\n“There have been others?” Marasi asked, confused.\n“Once in a while someone from above finds their way through the\ntunnels, and our protections, to the town,” the blonde woman said, patting\nher hands. “I keep telling the mayor that we don’t need those protections—\nthat we can take in far more people than we have now. But Gave Entrone is\na stubborn man. He insists that outsiders are too dangerous.”\n“Gave,” Marasi said. “Your … mayor?”\n“Yes, he’s from the other caverns originally,” the blonde woman said.\n“Ones underneath Elendel. There are several complexes, and occasionally\npeople from that one move here.”\n“Entrone is a tyrant,” the man with the tools said. “He won’t let us help\nthe world above. Won’t let us search for survivors. Won’t even let us\nexplore the caverns. And when people like you come—”\nThe blonde woman shot him a glare.\n“It’s all right,” Marasi said. “I need to know. Please, there are secrets\nhere you don’t understand.”\n“Well,” the blonde woman said, “when outsiders like you arrive … they\nget shipped off to one of the other caverns. We never get to talk for long.”\n“And they … tell you about the world above?” Marasi guessed,\nconnecting the clues.\n“A world of ashes,” one of the other women said. “A destroyed land full\nof terrible metal mutants.”\n“I saw one once,” the man said. “A terrible, twisted thing. Poor soul. It\nbroke in here, and the lord mayor’s security force killed it.”\nA Hemalurgic abomination, Marasi guessed, let loose in here on\npurpose to keep these people frightened.\n“Newcomers,” the woman said, “can’t help sharing how terrible things\nare—then get taken away.

They had no idea.\nThe blonde woman patted Marasi’s hand yet again. “We keep hoping\nthat we’ll get word that people we knew … had survived…”\n“I had three daughters,” said the man with the tools. “In Bilming? It’s\nbeen corroding me ever since I was saved, not knowing what happened to\nthem. Please, miss. Do you have news of any pockets of survivors up\nabove? The last refugee who came down here, he said the entire city was a\nwasteland, completely destroyed. But … some people must have lived…”\nMarasi frowned. “Wait. You were saved? How did you end up here?”\nThe blonde woman forced another biscuit on her, and shared a glance\nwith the others. “It was a random lottery,” she finally said. “The scientists\nwho discovered the impending eruptions realized they could save only a\nfew. So they made an impossible decision, randomly selecting people.”\n“It wasn’t completely random,” one of the women said. “It was weighted\ntoward women of childbearing age, for obvious reasons. And an emphasis\non Allomancers or those from the lines of Allomancers. Again for obvious\nreasons.”\n“We couldn’t bring our families,” the man said, looking down. “We\nargued for it, once we woke here. Oh, how we tried to get the managers to\nsee reason. But … eventually … we felt the earth shake, and we knew…”\n“Then the lord mayor arrived,” the blonde woman said, “and instituted\nstricter protocols.”\n“Tyrant,” the man muttered.\n“We still feel it shaking now and then,” one of the women said, looking\nup. “From the explosions of the Ashmounts. It must be deafening out there.\nWe are occasionally allowed up to glimpse your world, but not often. Too\ndangerous. Still, I’ve seen how it is out there. The distant rubbled city, the\nred sun, the suffocating ash. Like a funeral shroud…”\n“How do you see these things?” Marasi asked.\n“An observation room,” the woman explained. “There’s a ladder to it at\nthe edge of the cavern.”\nThat wouldn’t lead to the room Marasi had seen with the projector—\nthey were too far from there. She suspected that entire room was a test\nchamber, and that these people were somehow shown something more\nauthentic-seeming, without such an obvious light and projector.\nRegardless, she was now certain that was what the ruse was for. Along\nwith actors sent to reinforce the illusion—who were then taken away “to\nanother cavern,” so that they couldn’t slip up and reveal the truth. As long\nas none of the actual subjects of the experiment were allowed to leave, no\none would ever know.\nBut why? So much work, for what?\nExcept … Allomancers.\n“Some of you are Allomancers?” Marasi said.\n“Yes,” the blonde woman said. “I’m a Rioter, though not even my\nfamily knew about my powers.

Kessi a Soother.”\n“I had two Allomancer parents,” the man said, “but I never got any\npowers myself. The others are similar.”\nThat was the final piece. Marasi knew what was happening. And as she\nput it together, another revelation struck her. She did know the blonde\nwoman. There was a reason she was familiar.\nShe was Marasi’s distant cousin Armal Harms: a woman who had been\nkidnapped by Miles Hundredlives and the Vanishers seven years ago,\nduring Wax’s first case in the city after his return.\n57\nMarasi should have left right then. There was little she could learn from the\npeople caught in the Set’s experiment. Yet the implications weighed her\ndown. So she sat in that plush seat with a biscuit, feeling overwhelmed,\nsurrounded by people who’d been lied to for years.\nWax had been the first to notice that the kidnapped people had a history\nof Allomancy in their families. They’d thought them all women at first,\nthough a few other mysterious kidnappings during the same time period had\nproven to be men.\nMarasi and Wax had searched for these people for years, on and off.\nThey’d worried that the Set had done terrible things to them, but had never\nimagined anything like this. Locking them all up in a bunker? Convincing\nthem that the world had ended?\nOne of the Set’s primary long-term goals was to gain access to\nAllomantic powers, and the fact that the Set had so much access to spikes\nindicated that some of those who had been kidnapped had met with\ngruesome ends. But this group, and the fact that only the most important Set\nmembers had spikes so far, whispered of a much longer-term plan. Down\nhere, they’d have a literal breeding ground for children likely to be\nMetalborn—excellent for recruitment, or for creating spikes. It turned her\nstomach in knots, particularly when she thought to look at the women in the\nroom and noticed that two might be pregnant.\nThat playground the man had been building earlier suddenly took on a\ndarker cast. Yet … these people didn’t seem terrified their children would be\ntaken. There was a hope, and a good one, that Marasi had found them in\ntime. Not to prevent all the trauma, unfortunately—these people had been\nstolen from their families and lives and locked down here—but at least the\nSet hadn’t started turning them into spikes yet.\nThe lord mayor called the Community “Edwarn’s project,” she thought.\nThis whole thing had been the scheme of Wax’s uncle, a long-term solution\nto providing Allomantic powers to the Set. She suspected that upon his\ndeath, much of this infrastructure had been co-opted, with Telsin taking\ncommand and Autonomy breathing down their necks. A cavern that had\nbeen designed as an Allomantic eugenics experiment had now expanded to\nbecome a bunker housing the lord mayor’s loyalists. Further experiments\nwith spikes were leading to different innovations.\nBut this old experiment remained, and the people trapped in it. Marasi\nhad stumbled upon the solution to one of her most troubling unsolved\nmysteries. She could rescue these people. Assuming she could save the\nworld itself first."

Steris’s …\ncousin.” It was the lie they’d always used, before her father had been\nwilling to publicly admit to his infidelity.\n“Steris?” Armal asked, perking up. “Is she … I mean…?”\n“She’s alive,” Marasi said. “Armal … they all are. You’ve been lied to in\na terrible way. I don’t know how to be more delicate about this. There was\nno ashfall. The Basin didn’t fall. It’s a hoax.” She grimaced. “You were all\nkidnapped by some horrible people.”\nThose in the room looked at one another.\n“Ash sickness,” one of the other women said.\nThe mousy woman nodded, then patted Marasi on the shoulder. “You’re\ndisoriented, seeing delusions, dear.”\nMarasi sighed. Of course the Set would have come up with an excuse\nlike that—they’d want a fallback explanation in case someone snuck\nthrough the defenses.\n“I can’t prove it to you now,” Marasi said. “Though I will find a way.\nPlease, consider my words. They will soften the blow when you have to\nconfront the truth. I’m a senior officer in the Elendel Constabulary.” She\npulled out her credentials. “For years I’ve been trying to trace you: people\nkidnapped by a mysterious organization called the Set. They have other\nplans in motion—even more dangerous ones—which is why I can’t stay.\nBut the truth is, Armal, that you were taken because they wanted\nAllomancers. And they are willing to play the long game to get them.”\nArmal glanced upward—as small feet thumped on the upper floor, and\nthe laughter of children drifted down.\n“You have to agree it is odd,” Marasi said, “that you were kidnapped by\na group of armed men during a robbery.”\n“They had to act that way,” Armal said. “To hide what they were doing.\nTo avoid a mass panic.”\n“Posing as a group of thieves?” Marasi asked.\n“It worked in the Words of Founding,” she replied. “The Survivor\nhimself pretended to be a thief.”\nMarasi didn’t have time to continue this argument. “I need to locate\nGave Entrone,” she said. “Do you know where I could find him?”\nAt that very moment, as if decreed by Harmony, a voice blasted from a\nset of speakers outside. Echoing in the vast cavern through the public\naddress system.\nIt was Gave Entrone, the lord mayor.\n“Be warned, people of Wayfarer,” he said in a tinny broadcast voice. “A\ndangerous outsider has been spotted slipping through the outer tunnels,\npossibly coming in this direction.

She is likely armed, and known to be\nvery, very ash-sick.\n“Treat her as extremely dangerous and report sightings of her to your\nneighborhood tranquility officer immediately. Do not approach her. Do not\nengage with her. She has killed already, and will kill again if given the\nchance.”\nThe group of people all looked upward, and Marasi tensed. How far\nwould their congeniality extend now?\n“Hell,” Armal said. “We have to hide her.”\n“Others saw her entering,” the man with the tools said.\n“We’ll rough up the room,” Armal said, “and claim she threatened us\nand ran out.” She looked to Marasi. “You’re confused and ash-sick. But …\ndo you remember how to get out of here? The path through the caverns?”\n“Forget that,” said the mousy woman, suddenly fierce. “Do you have\nweapons? Anything we could use to overthrow Entrone?”\n“We’re not going to overthrow him!” Armal said. “All we need to do is\nfollow our plan: sneak up to the surface, find survivors, and bring them\nhere. Prove to everyone that we can do something to help. That will shift\nthe lord mayor to our line of thinking.”\nThat was a noble philosophy. And also completely hopeless. Marasi did\nnot have time to try to persuade them further. “Where is Entrone?” she said,\nstanding.\n“He has a new mansion at the edge of town,” Armal said. “Large, with\nthe broadcast station in it. It’s dangerous there because he needs metals to\nwork the devices—if mutants ever invade, they’ll go for him first.”\n“How very brave of him,” Marasi said, hurrying to the window—the\nothers moved aside for her. “No doubt he has a nice tunnel to the surface\ntoo. You know the flat outer walls? Those have one-way glass. They watch\nyou through it.”\n“Ash sickness,” one of the women hissed.\n“Is there…” Marasi said, trying to figure out how to phrase it, “some\nkind of portal around here? Rusts. I don’t even know what it would look\nlike. A large construction of some sort, maybe? Or an area that is\nspecifically off-limits?”\nThey just stared at her, confused. Should have expected that, Marasi\nthought. Of course they wouldn’t know. They were captives, not confidants.\nBut something about that puzzled her. If Entrone was creating a portal\nfor Autonomy’s army, why would he do it here, near these people? Why not\ndo it in a more isolated portion of the cavern complex, away from his test\nsubjects? Yet he’d specifically said he was coming here to open the portal.\nShe glanced to Armal—who was holding Marasi’s credentials, a frown\non her face. “Why would you go to the trouble,” she said, “of carrying fake\ncredentials? Going all the way to create a fake stamp, for this year’s\ndate…?”\n“She must be far gone,” one of the others said.\nArmal met Marasi’s gaze, her frown deepening.\n“It’s because I’m telling you the truth,” Marasi said. “Now I need to get\nto Entrone and stop him.”\nArmal shook her head. “Marasi, we can help each other. Don’t do"

We don’t like the lord mayor, but we don’t want violence.\nThere has been too much death already. If we hide you, we can talk, plan.”\n“No time for planning,” Marasi said, hurrying back across the room and\nseizing her rucksack. “Go ahead and rough up this room. Tell them I’m\nextremely dangerous—tell them at length. Maybe it will delay them a\nlittle.” She fished a pistol out of her rucksack—making them gawk at her.\nAll but Armal, who took it in with a disappointed expression.\n“Look,” Marasi said to them, “things are about to get very dangerous\nand very confusing in here. My friends have dealt with a large number of\ntheir soldiers, so there’s a chance I can handle Entrone alone. But if I don’t\ncome back, you need to overthrow him. Millions of lives might depend on\nit.”\n“We can’t do that,” Armal said. “Even if we wanted to, we don’t have\nweapons.”\n“You are weapons,” Marasi said. “If we can just get you…”\nMetals. That was why there weren’t any down here. The Set had\nimprisoned a large group of people who either had extraordinary abilities,\nor were likely to give birth to people with them. Telsin and the others knew\nthat unless they were careful, they’d be overpowered by their own captives.\nHence the lack of metals and the story of “mutants” who could sense it.\nHow did you keep a bunch of dangerous people captive? You convinced\nthem that they weren’t actually captives.\nMarasi turned and met Armal’s eyes. “Which way to the lord mayor’s\nhome?”\n“I…”\nMarasi held her gaze until Armal glanced back down—at Marasi’s\ncredentials—and then looked to the side.\n“You know, don’t you,” Marasi said. “That what I’m saying is true? Or\nat least you suspect. You’ve always known something was wrong.”\n“I have a family,” Armal said. “Children and a husband I love.”\n“And if Entrone wins,” Marasi said, “they are doomed to a life in\ndarkness. Armal, he is planning to take your children from you. You need to\nfind yourselves some metals and fight back with everything you have.”\n“Find metals,” one of the women said, with a sniff. “What do you want\nus to do? Lick rocks, hoping there’s some iron in them?”\n“I don’t know if I believe you or not,” Armal said. “And I’m … I’m not\ngoing to fight, even if I had the weapons. Maybe I can take you to where\nEntrone lives. But that’s all.”\nIdiot people, Marasi thought, grinding her teeth. Then she felt foolish.\nThey weren’t idiots because they were scared.

These people, and those like them, were\nthe reason she did what she did. Her reason for being a constable. It was her\njob to rescue them.\n“Just take me to Entrone,” Marasi said. “I’ll find a way to handle him.”\nShe lifted the rucksack to her shoulder.\nThen froze as she heard it clink.\n58\nWayne watched as Wax held the bottles over his head, then Pushed the caps\noff with a quick flip of Allomancy. Handy, that. When God had been\ndesignin’ Allomancy, had he considered that Coinshots would make good\nbottle openers?\nWax held one out to Wayne, who wiped his runny nose on his\nhandkerchief, then took the bottle. He sighed, his head pounding, his body\naching. Damn, he hated storing health. Made you feel like the stuff a fellow\nfound between his toes after wearin’ his shoes too long.\nHe lounged back against the support running alongside the front of the\nbillboard. They’d flown up here, naturally, because Coinshots liked being in\nthe sky. Plus, Wax liked bein’ blatant. And what was more blatant than\nhavin’ a beer in front of the city’s stupid propaganda poster?\nThe thing had a ledge in the front, so sitting was comfortable enough.\nThis was presumably for the workers to erect the image: a nauseating\npicture of a fellow looking toward the sky, with lines of light spreading out\nbehind him. INDEPENDENCE THROUGH SHARED STRUGGLE, it said. Wayne could\nhave eaten the beer bottle wrapper and dumped a load the next day that\nmade more sense than that.\nThe offending billboard was up high, pointed inward across the main\nhighway. Toward the city’s central spire, Independence Tower, nicknamed\nthe Shaw. After old Kredik Shaw.\nWax held his bottle out, and Wayne reached forward to clink the necks\ntogether. Then Wayne tipped his head back and drank, welcoming the\nstrong taste. Hoppy, bitter. Like a good beer should be. Out in the Roughs\nthey knew that. Why clean it all up, make it taste like somethin’ other than\nit was? City beers … they were for people that didn’t actually like beer.\nThe suds felt good on his throat, which turned all scratchy when he\nstored health. Like he was perpetually sick all the time, every day—but\nnormally didn’t notice it because his body was good at covering it up. Only\nthe moment he started storing health, the sickness got the upper hand.\nWax took a long pull on his own beer and relaxed into the taste, his eyes\ndistant. Content.\n“Remember that time,” Wayne said, “when you went to take the tops\noffa the bottles, but I’d smacked the beers on the table first, so they squirted\nout all over your head?”\n“Which time?” Wax said.\n“Heh,” Wayne said. “That joke never gets old.”\n“Because it was ancient the first time you tried it.”\nWayne grinned. “I was thinkin’ of the first time, after you caught Icy\nBen Oldson. You know, when Blinker was your deputy?”\n“I remember.”"

But honestly, Wax had terrible taste in deputies.\n“I do remember that first time you got me by shaking the bottles,” Wax\nsaid, sipping his beer. “I remember it well. It was the first time you really\nseemed to smile.”\n“Yeah, well,” Wayne said, “I’m good at pretendin’ to be things I ain’t,\nyou know? I eventually put together how to feign bein’ a person who was\nworth somethin’. It’s a good lie. Still manage to believe it.” He took a drink.\n“Mosta the time.”\n“Wayne…”\n“I don’t need a speech, Wax.” Wayne rested his head back against the\nmetal support, closing his eyes. “I’ll be fine. Just gotta put on the hat…”\n“You’ve been feeling worse lately, haven’t you?” Wax asked. Annoying,\nperceptive fellow. “This isn’t only about MeLaan.”\nWayne shrugged, his eyes still closed.\n“Out with it,” Wax said. “I gave you a beer. You owe me an answer—\nthose are the rules.”\nRuin that man. He knew the rules.\n“I’ve just been thinkin’,” Wayne said softly. “Rememberin’ my family,\nand how ashamed my ma would be of me for turnin’ out to be a murderer.\nI’ve been workin’ all these years to pay it off, but I don’t feel no better. So I\nguess I’m beginnin’ to wonder: Maybe I can’t ever do enough good to\nbalance the bad I done. Maybe I’ll always be worthless.”\n“You can’t pay it off, Wayne,” Wax whispered. “That much is true.”\nWayne opened his eyes.\n“Durkel, that man you killed,” Wax said, “he’s always going to be dead.\nNothing you can do will change that. No number of good deeds will bring\nhim back or earn you forgiveness.”\nWayne looked away, feeling sick—and not just because he was storin’\nup health. “I know I said I didn’t need a speech, Wax. But I don’t know that\nyou need to rub it in, neither.”\n“Fortunately,” Wax said, “you don’t need forgiveness, Wayne.”\n“Now that’s nonsense.”\n“No it’s not.” Wax leaned forward, pointing with his bottle. “Wayne,\nwould you do it again, if you had the chance? Rob a man for his pocket\nchange? Shoot him when things get heated?”\n“What? Of course not!”\n“So,” Wax said, leaning back, “you don’t need forgiveness. Because you\naren’t the man who killed Durkel. Not anymore. The man who did that,\nwell, he’s dead. Buried beneath six feet of the clay and rock that passes for\nsoil in the Roughs. You haven’t been him for years.”\n“I don’t think it works that way,” Wayne said."

If there’s no chance for you, Wayne, there’s\nno chance for anyone. We might as well shoot a man the first time he does\nanything wrong, because hey … he’ll never change, so who cares?”\n“That’s not fair.”\n“You’re not fair,” Wax said, “to yourself. I’ve watched you, Wayne. You\ndidn’t become my deputy because you wanted redemption. You don’t keep\nfighting alongside me because you need to be forgiven. You do it because of\nthe man you’ve become. You do it because you want to make the world\nbetter.”\n“Maybe you’re wrong,” Wayne said. “You don’t know what’s in my\nbrain, Wax. Maybe I am corrupt, through and through. You know how I am\nwhen I get in a brawl. Maybe I’m doin’ all this to get a chance to fight and\nkill folks. Because I like it.”\n“Nope,” Wax said. He finished off his beer, then held the bottle out,\ndangling between two fingers. “I don’t buy it, Wayne. I know you. And I\nrespect you. Admire you. There are times I wish I could be as good a man\nas you are.”\nWayne sat up, squinting at him. “Wait. You’re serious?”\n“Damn right.”\n“Mate, I burned down a building today. And not one what you’re\nsupposed to burn down, like a school. A big important building.”\n“Yeah, and what did you do with that fire?” Wax asked. “Did you light it\nand run?”\nWayne shrugged.\n“No, you got everyone out,” Wax said. “You specifically led a group of\npeople knocking on doors to make sure everyone escaped. You lit the fire\nbecause you needed to, but then you made sure that…” He hesitated,\ndouble-checked his bottle was empty, then looked at Wayne with a frown.\n“Wayne. Schools aren’t meant to be burned down. Just because we did it\nonce doesn’t mean it’s all right.”\n“No, see,” Wayne said, finishing off his own beer, “I figured it out.\nSchools is meant to be burned down. Imagine you was a kid, and you woke\nup and found the school was plumb gone? Well damn, that’d be the best\nrusting day ever!”\nWax sighed.\n“I figure,” Wayne continued, “that’s why the city keeps building more\nschools. Have you seen how many there are these days? The government is\nsaving them up, in case they need to make some kids happy. Then they’ll\nburn ’em down.”\nWax eyed him. So Wayne smiled and winked, letting him know that this\nmight have been an exaggerated-story-type thing.\nWax leaned back. “I can’t tell with you sometimes…”\n“That’s the problem though, ain’t it?” Wayne said. “Because I do terrible\nstuff!

You’re a good person.”\n“Fat lot of good it does when I still mess everything up, mate. I still grab\nstuff sometimes, even when it’s not my friend’s and I ain’t joking. I don’t\nthink about it until later. And I realize, maybe that fellow liked his cigar\nbox.”\n“You mess up a lot less than you fix, Wayne. You can’t deny it. You are\na good man.”\nWayne fell quiet. Because … because he liked Wax. More, he trusted\nWax. Wax was right about things.\nCould he … be right about this?\nWax leaned forward. “You can’t keep digging up the corpse of who you\nused to be, Wayne. You can’t keep toting it around. Let him stay buried.\nConsider who you are, not who you left behind. That’s what I’ve learned\nthese last few years. It’s made all the difference.”\nHuh. It was platitudes. Easy words to say. But Wax didn’t just say\nthings. He never had. Wax meant things.\nMaybe … maybe it was time to bury that corpse. Because rusts, it was\nfeelin’ heavy lately. What would life be like if he weren’t carryin’ that\nthing? Maybe a part of him was ready, and had been for years. He’d\nstopped shakin’ when he held a gun. His body was ready to move on. Could\nhis mind allow it?\nHe scanned out over the city, his head pounding from storing health.\nCars bustled below, representatives of a new world, with fancy new\nbuildings throwing long shadows as the sun started to set. The whole Basin\nwas changing.\nWhy not him with it?\nHe let himself stop storing up health. Truth was, it wouldn’t do much.\nHis head cleared, and his aches faded.\n“Right, then,” he said, sitting up. “We needta solve this thing, Wax. I’ve\ngot this bad feeling—had it all day—that we’re on a trail that is far, far too\ncold for comfort.”\n“Agreed,” Wax said, pulling over two duffels. “Look through that. See\nwhat Steris packed us.” He pushed over the first of them—his ammo pack,\nretrieved from a rooftop.\nWayne took it and undid the ties and zipper, while Wax dug in the other\nand took out some pages, holding them up. The billboard had some electric\nlights on it, to make the thing visible at night—which was good for readin’.\nHuh. Maybe Wax had a good reason for pickin’ this spot after all.\nWayne began counting ammo for Wax’s guns, setting it aside in little\npouches. “So,” he said, “they was testin’ some flyin’ bomb out in the\nocean?”\n“They were only testing the delivery device,” Wax said, shuffling\npapers. “No bomb on it yet.

I’ve got schematics for the bomb here, and until recently they\nwere having trouble creating a big enough battery to make it portable.”\n“But they figured that out?”\n“Unfortunately,” he said, handing a schematic over—as if Wayne would\nhave any use for it. “Look there. Finally have it working, portable but large.\nThat’s what’s giving them such a headache. They have these rockets that\ncan fly a good thirty or forty miles, but not with such a huge payload.” He\nshuffled more pages, then handed another over. “This schematic is a dead\nman’s switch. An extremely pernicious one. They don’t want anyone\ndisarming the thing. And here, a design for a much larger rocket. Maybe a\nlast chance at making this work, but they’re worried it won’t fly far\nenough … and might catch Bilming or other towns and not just Elendel.”\nWayne grunted, tucking the pages in his pocket. Then, digging further\ninto his own duffel, he found a sandwich.\n“Hot damn,” he said, unwrapping it. Pastrami? Hot double damn. “Good\nthing you ignored me and stayed with that woman. She’s quite a catch.”\nWax gave him a flat look.\n“I was wrong about her, all right?” Wayne said, digging out a second\nsandwich and tossing it to Wax. “I’m wrong about people a lot. Maybe even\nmyself.”\nWax smiled, then dug into the sandwich. Wayne did the same, and he\nhadn’t realized how hungry he was. Some canteens followed—alas, just\nwater. He wished for another beer. But no, they had work to do. One would\nkeep them limber. Any more would be dangerous.\nWayne dug out a replacement metalmind for Wax, filled with extra\nweight, and tossed it to him. Next were some vials filled with metal flakes,\nall in a little sheath. Eight of them had been removed already; eight\nremained. “These ain’t your normal sort.”\n“Harmony sent them,” Wax said. “Said they were special.”\n“Did he now…” Wayne said, eyeing the last one in line, with a red cork.\nHe set those aside, then took out a small pouch of metals with his name on\nit. Rusting woman had even sent him some bendalloy. “So, where do we go,\nWax? You said they were buildin’ one final rocket, biggest of them all.\nWhere do we find it?”\nWax scanned the notes. “They’re worried, Wayne. Up against the wall.\nThere’s notations at the end here, from today. They are terrified that\nAutonomy will cancel their whole project—violently. So they’re scrambling\nto fend us off, and for any last chance at victory. But where … how…”\nWayne continued fishing in his duffel, then pulled out a strange wicker\nball with a weight at the center. “Is this something Ranette made?”\nWax grinned, waving for Wayne to toss it over. Then Wax launched it\ninto the air with a Steelpush. “Max must have helped Steris pack. Sent me a\nlittle gift.” He launched it higher next time. Then higher.\nThen he caught it and froze."

Plus, they needed to build a big rocket\nsomeplace where people wouldn’t be able to poke around. Get as much\nheight as they can, in a secure location…”\nWayne breathed out, and the two of them turned toward the center of the\ncity. And the Shaw, the enormous tower there—which had new construction\non top, supposedly adding a few new floors. Or was it a different\nconstruction project entirely?\n“Damn,” Wayne said, noting the number of lights on in the upper floors\nof the tower, and the floodlights on the top. “They’re busy tonight. Backs\nagainst the wall indeed…” He looked to Wax. “It’s a mesa. That spire.\nThat’s the mesa.”\n“What mesa?”\n“In my ma’s story,” Wayne said, “it all ended at the mesa. The lone peak\nin the center of a flat landscape.”\nWayne eyed his friend to see if he complained they weren’t in that story.\nBecause in this, Wax would be wrong. They were in it—or at least living\nalongside it. Because Wayne had decided it was so, and that was the way of\nthings.\n“A mesa, eh?” Wax said, letting one leg slip out over the edge to dangle.\n“Yeah, I can see that.”\n“I could never figure out the part that happened next,” Wayne said. “In\nthe story, the lawman went to the mesa to find the bad guy—Blatant Barm,\nworst villain there ever was. But Barm was the mesa.”\n“He … was the mesa?”\n“Yeah, like he’d transformed into it,” Wayne said.\n“That … doesn’t make much sense.”\n“Sure doesn’t,” Wayne said. “I never could figure out why Ma told it\nthat way.”\n“Maybe it doesn’t mean anything,” Wax said. “Maybe she came up with\nit because something needs to happen in stories.”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “You didn’t know my ma, Wax. She was good at\nstories. Real good. It meant somethin’…” Wayne took a deep breath. “If\nwe’ve gotta get to the top, that’s gonna be a rough ascent. There aren’t any\nother buildings around it nearly as tall. You won’t be able to Push us up\nthere.”\n“We’d be exposed to snipers trying that anyway,” Wax said, squinting at\nthe floodlights high atop the Shaw. “We’ll have to go up the inside … Ruin,\nWayne. You’re right. It’s going to be rough.”\nWayne’s foot thumped against something from the ammo duffel. He\nfrowned, then knelt and pulled out a wooden box that had been tucked at\nthe bottom. It had Ranette’s symbol on the top.\nWax breathed out softly, almost reverently. “Steris packed it.”\n“What?” Wayne said, opening the top.\nHe revealed a gun.

Stocky, with a barrel a good four inches across.\nUnlike anything he’d ever seen.\n“Something special.” Wax took it out, then removed other pieces from\nthe box to assemble something that looked a bit like a single-barrel shotgun,\nonly with a much wider bore. It had a big central ammo wheel—almost like\nfor an oversized revolver—which held slugs bigger than shot glasses.\nWayne whistled.\n“We just call it the Big Gun,” Wax said. “I’d hoped I wouldn’t need it. It\nwasn’t built for a lawman.

Then mists began to curl in the air. Growing like\nvines from invisible holes, pouring out into the city.\n“Well,” Wax whispered, “that’s a welcome sight.” He glanced at the gun\nin his hands. “This next part is going to be bloody, Wayne. How much\nhealing do you have left?”\n“Not much,” Wayne admitted. “I can handle a bullet or two. That’s it.”\nWax took a deep breath. “I’ll want you to stay back.

Maybe that’s what she was saying, Wayne: It’s\nthe world that we have to worry about. Individual men, yes, they can be\nevil. But we should worry more about the world itself making them so.”\n“What do you mean?”\n“Well,” Wax said, “do you think you’d have fallen in with the Plank\nBoys if your mother hadn’t died in that accident?”\n“Absolutely not,” Wayne said.\n“Nearly every man I’ve had to shoot? He had a story like yours. It’s the\nsort of thing Marasi is always talking about. You have to stop the Blatant\nBarms of the world, yes. But if you can create a world where fewer boys\ngrow up alone … well, maybe you’ll have far fewer Blatant Barms to face\nin the future.

No amount of\ncomplaining, no phantom guilt, no whispering lying voice that says\notherwise is going to change that. ‘You’re meant to be helping people,’\nWayne. ‘It’s what you do.’”\nWayne cocked his head. “Was that … a quote or somethin’?”\n“It’s what you said to me seven years ago. When people needed me, but\nI was too afraid to pick up a gun.”\n“You remember that?” Wayne said. “The exact things I said?”\n“Of course I do. Those words changed my life.”\nWayne let out a howl of laughter. “Damn, Wax. I just say things! You’re\nnot supposed to actually pay attention to them!”\n“It was meaningful!”\n“Ha. Listening to me. Might as well write the stuff I say on a plaque or\nsomething. ‘You’re meant to be helping people. Also, remember—ain’t no\nfellow who regretted giving it one extra shake, but you can bet every guy\nhas regretted giving one too few.’”\nThey shared a look as the mists began to curl around them, headlights\nilluminating the roadway beneath like a river of light running toward the\nShaw. Then they both nodded.\n“You ready for this?” Wax asked.\n“Let’s do it,” Wayne replied.\n59\nArmal and her nervous little collection of townspeople insisted on taking\nMarasi together. They hurried along a “back road” of Wayfarer—a path\nlined with fake trees, simulating a park.\nIt worked. The Set’s “tranquility officers” started a door-to-door search\nbehind them—along the main road—but had to maintain the illusion of\nbeing a friendly neighborhood watch. This promenade gave Marasi cover,\nletting her slip past.\nEntrone’s home—constructed over the last year—was so large that she\nsensed resentment from the others. He should have been smart enough to\nkeep it modest; he likely didn’t spend much time in it. But the man’s ego\napparently demanded something ostentatious—including a third floor with\nlarge picture windows on all sides. As they approached, Marasi decided it\nwas probably just another observation center. Maybe with a few false rooms\nat the front to keep up appearances.\n“All right,” Marasi said to Armal and the others, “think about what I’ve\nsaid. Please.”\nThey huddled among the fake trees and bushes. Rusts. Marasi wasn’t"

Marasi wasn’t\ncertain they’d be of much help. All the same, she hurried to the building—\nwhich was on a small stone hill.\nShe was spotted by people gathering outside their townhomes, in\ndeliberate defiance of Entrone’s orders. Some pointed. Well, the time for\nsneaking was gone anyway. Feeling alone, Marasi used Moonlight’s picks\nto undo the lock on the mansion’s back door, then slipped in. She passed\nthrough a kitchen that seemed a little too clean and quickly found another\ndoor, held shut with several deadbolts. Right, then. She wasn’t getting\nthrough that with picks.\nShe took a deep breath. There was so much that could go wrong with\nher plan. But she was out of resources and out of time; once in a while you\njust had to do things Wayne’s way.\nShe attached one of Moonlight’s explosives to the door, took cover\nbehind a cabinet, then blasted the thing off. A second later she burst through\nthe smoking doorway, pistol ready. The two people in here had ducked to\nthe floor at the explosion, though the small charge—intended for this kind\nof use—hadn’t done much damage to the room. They had been monitoring\nsome radio equipment. A closed door on the other side of the room led\nfarther into the building, and a strange glowing light came from beneath it.\n“Down,” Marasi said, her gun trained on the radio operators. The two\ndidn’t look armed, and they hastened to comply.\nRadio equipment. Marasi crossed the room, hauled the woman to her\nfeet, then gestured to the equipment. “This broadcasts to the town? Through\nthese microphones?”\n“Y-yes,” the woman said.\n“Turn them on,” Marasi ordered.\nThe woman hurriedly flicked some switches. Then Marasi sent the two\ntechnicians outside and trapped them in a slowness bubble from a charged\ngrenade. She didn’t have time to do more.\nWhen she returned to the radio room, the door on the far end had opened\nand people were entering to see what the ruckus was about. And rusts, one\nof them was Entrone himself, appearing weary, bags under his eyes, wan\ncomplexion making him look like a corpse dressed for a funeral in his fine\nsuit and formal hat.\nThe room behind him glowed with a white light. Marasi glimpsed a\nlarge chamber with a white floor—the source of the light—but she didn’t\nhave time to study it now. Instead she leveled her gun at Entrone, but his\nbodyguards immediately stepped in front of him.\n“I told you, gentlemen,” Entrone said from behind them. “The rat we’ve\nbeen hunting doesn’t hide in the dark. Wait long enough, and it will come to\nyou.”\n“By the authority of the Elendel Constabulary,” Marasi said, “I order\nyou to lay down arms and metals, then submit to arrest.”\nEntrone sighed in a long-suffering way, like a man who had just been\ngiven a bedtime ultimatum by his three-year-old. So Marasi fired. She\ndropped one of the bodyguards, but the other returned fire."

She\ndropped one of the bodyguards, but the other returned fire.\nMarasi ducked back into the kitchen, narrowly avoiding the shots.\n“Think about this, Entrone!” Marasi called into the room. “Are you really\nprepared to kill so many? Can anything be worth such a terrible act?”\nHe didn’t respond. Rusts. She’d hoped to get him talking. She\nexchanged a few more shots with the remaining bodyguard, then reloaded.\nAs she did, she heard footsteps. Dodging back by reflex, she narrowly\nescaped getting caught in a slowness bubble. Not made by her, but one that\nhad extended through the wall. She could pick it out by the faint\nshimmering of the air.\nShe peeked through and saw the bodyguard frozen in a slowness bubble\njust inside the doorway. Entrone was safely beyond it. But how…?\nThat bodyguard shares my Allomantic power, she realized. He was\ntrying to catch me in the bubble, but put it up a hair too slowly. If she\nhadn’t dodged, she’d be trapped in that bubble with him while time sped up\naround them. Giving Entrone plenty of time to get reinforcements.\nIt was a tactic she had employed herself on several occasions. It chilled\nher to realize she’d nearly been caught in it. The slowness bubble took up a\nchunk of the kitchen and most of the doorway into the radio room.\nEntrone paced, separated from her by that slowed time. Gunfire would\nbe useless; they could only glare at one another. She didn’t have a good\nangle to see into the room beyond him, but that glow … it reminded her of\nsomething.\nEntrone settled down in a nearby chair.\n“Why, Entrone?” Marasi asked. “Why lock all these people away like\nthis? Why pretend the world has ended?” With that corner of the doorway\nnot caught in the bubble, her voice should be able to reach him.\nUnfortunately, he refused to take the bait, instead simply leaning back in his\nchair.\nMaybe I’m approaching this wrong, Marasi thought. He’s not going to\nvolunteer anything. But what if he thought he was the one getting\ninformation out of me?\n“Wax and Wayne have stopped the launch,” Marasi lied, taking a risk.\n“Elendel is safe. You’re trapped, and soon this place will be flooded with\nconstables.”\nEntrone didn’t laugh at her immediately, which was a good sign. She\nhoped he’d try to pry for more information.\n“That’s nonsense of course,” he said. “It—”\nThen he stopped. Because his voice echoed outside the building,\nprojected into the city. He glanced at the radio and saw it was on. He gave\nher a dry look.\n“I think,” he continued, “you are seriously ash-sick, young woman.\nPlease, let us help you.”\nThen he reached over and flipped off the radio.\nDamn.\n“Clever,” he said to her. “But what do you think would happen if those\nin the Community knew the truth? They’re a bunch of cowed civilians.\nThey’ve been imprisoned here for seven years, never knowing the truth.\nNever caring to know it. You really think they’d help you?”\nMarasi winced. So much for that plan."

So much for that plan.\nThe guard remained frozen in place between them. Eventually he’d\nrealize he hadn’t caught her, and would drop his bubble. But that could take\ntime, inside one of those. She knew how that felt.\n“Entrone,” she said, “you don’t have to go through with this.”\n“With what, exactly?” he said.\n“You’re going to open a portal to let Autonomy’s army begin an\ninvasion of our world. I know the plan.”\nHe grunted, then slumped forward further. He was still slime—the way\nhe’d casually ordered the execution of those captives had proved it—but he\nwas also obviously burdened by events. Perhaps she could shake his\nconviction.\n“Why?” she asked, genuinely curious. “You know they’re here not to\nrule, but destroy. Lay waste.”\n“Because if I don’t,” he said, “she’ll send them anyway—and then I’ll\nbe one of the ones who gets killed. We can’t fight them. They’ll annihilate\nour forces.”\n“Will they?” Marasi said. “From what I hear, Autonomy is frightened of\nus. Worried we’ll outpace her people technologically. If she could destroy\nus easily, she’d have done it already, right?”\n“It takes special circumstances to create one of these portals,” he said.\n“Even for her. Can’t just be anywhere, or anytime.” He turned, looking over\nhis shoulder. “The timing gave us a deadline.”\nRusts. That room behind him … that was where the portal would open,\nwasn’t it? She’d assumed there would be some kind of gateway, but it was\nthe ground that was glowing. Rusts … maybe he hadn’t wanted a big\nmansion out of pride. Maybe they’d built it here to hide the fact that the\nportal, whatever it was, would appear here.\n“The location…” he said, turning back. “I think it’s because of those\npeople, oddly. Such a large collection of Metalborn. And we were required\nto bring in a strange power, a glowing light. That’s part of the key.”\n“But—”\n“Are you a Survivorist, constable?” he asked.\n“Yes,” she said.\n“Then you know our prime tenet,” he said, looking up and meeting her\neyes. “The one we’re taught from childhood?”\n“Survive,” she whispered.\nHe nodded.\n“Not like this,” she said. “Not at the expense of others. Kelsier didn’t\ngive up without a fight. He didn’t simply go with what the Lord Ruler\ndemanded. He taught us to survive despite obstacles. Not to let ourselves be\nslowly crushed so we could gain a minute or two of extra breath.”\n“Interpret it how you wish, constable,” Entrone said, rubbing his brow.\n“I think these troops will come even if Telsin is successful … to help\noversee us, in this new world. One where we serve Autonomy.”\n“That’s an excuse,” Marasi said. “Worse, it’s cowardice. You’re the\nmayor of this city. Your duty is to the people, Entrone.”"

Your duty is to the people, Entrone.”\nHe laughed, standing up. “You can’t possibly be that idealistic.”\nShe blushed.\nWas she?\nYes, she was. And proud of it.\nI have to find a way to close that portal, she thought, looking through\nthe bubble of slowed time toward the room with the light. Again she\nthought it seemed familiar. White, with a mother-of-pearl sheen. Yes. It was\nlike the pure Investiture from Moonlight’s jars. The floor had been dug out,\nthen filled up with the stuff, making a kind of pool in a recessed portion of\nthe ground.\n“A great deal of power in one place…” she said. Allik always said that\nyou weren’t supposed to store too much harmonium in one place, or\n“strange things happen, yah?” He didn’t know what those things were. But\nMarasi swore she could make out a warping of the air in that room. That\nliquid was somehow powering the portal.\nEntrone had stepped up to the faintly visible barrier of the slowness\nbubble. It was smaller than the ones Marasi made, closer to the size of\nWayne’s bubbles. Entrone shook his head at the trapped guard.\n“You’re like him, if I recall,” Entrone said, walking to the side. “A\nPulser—capable of making bubbles of slowed time.”\nMarasi didn’t respond. Entrone strolled sideways, near the wall\nseparating the radio room from the kitchen, where she couldn’t see him\nthrough the doorway anymore. The bubble filled most of the radio room,\nbut there were some portions at the edges that weren’t touched by it. His\nvoice continued a moment later.\n“Do you ever feel,” he said, “embarrassed by your useless power,\nconstable? I know your sister is an embarrassment to your father. But at\nleast he acknowledged her.”\nHe had done his research; a few years back, that barb might have\nbothered her. Now Marasi recognized it for what it was—an attempt to put\nher off balance. She focused on the glowing pool. The surface was\nbeginning to ripple. Was there another way into the—\nAt that moment, Entrone ripped through the wall itself, circumventing\nthe slowness bubble. Rusts! He’d sounded so worn out that Marasi had\nnearly discounted him. Now he crashed through the wood, shattering beams\nlike they were twigs.\nMarasi shot him in the chest, but the wounds healed immediately. Faster\nthan Wayne’s did. He gave her a grim smile.\nMarasi unloaded the entire magazine into him, and did little more than\npoke a few holes in his suit. He grabbed her by the front of her shirt and\nlifted her. Dust from the drywall streamed from his clothing as he pulled her\nright up to his face. Still in his grip, Marasi hit him on the side of the head\nwith the butt of her pistol. He just grinned. She did manage to knock his hat\noff though.\n“I’m a god now, little bastard,” he said to her. “What strength do you\nhave to stand against me? Your Allomancy? Pathetic. Your weapons?"

You have no power to threaten me.”\nHe turned and threw her out the window with a crash, back into the\nmain cavern.\nIt hurt. A sharp blinding pain all across her body. Cuts and slices,\nfollowed by a dizzying hit to her head and shoulder as she slowed and\nstopped in a heap. Through teary eyes, through the pain, she saw his shape\n—shadowy to her vision—climbing out the window after her.\n“The army is coming,” he said, his voice growing softer as he stalked\nforward, his nice coat disheveled. “I imagined I’d be some grand lord,\nruling in a new world. But I guess … I guess … we all have to do what we\nmust to survive.”\nHe reached for her. She tried to pull back, noting another group of\nshapes stepping out from the shadows outside the building. Had Armal and\nthe others followed her up to the mansion?\nShe had hoped they would overhear Entrone admitting the truth via the\nradio. But perhaps … perhaps they’d been close enough, in their curiosity,\nto hear him speak now …\nPlease, please have heard him.\nGave Entrone loomed over her.\n“You’re right about my powers,” Marasi said with a cough. “I’ve found\nuses for them. But they aren’t where my strength comes from. Not really.”\nHe grabbed her.\n“My strength,” she whispered, “never came from Allomancy. Rusts … I\nlearned that lesson as a child. It doesn’t come from weapons, or even the\ncredentials I carry.”\nPlease …\nEntrone raised her into the air as a distinct clink sounded. He froze, then\nturned to see Armal. The source of the sound was a jar she’d dropped to the\nground. Once full of light. Now empty.\nA replacement for metal, Moonlight had said. But supercharged.\n“I’m a constable, Entrone,” Marasi whispered. “My strength isn’t in\nmyself. It comes from the people.”\nA Rioting, with the power of a thousand Allomancers, hit their emotions\nlike a physical wave of force.\n60\nShame hit Marasi like a wave.\nThe Rioter’s art. Pick an emotion, then blast it into a person on full\nautomatic. It was easier for emotional Allomancers to target their powers in\na direction instead of at a specific individual.\nIt caught Entrone, judging by his stumble, but it also pounded Marasi\nwith a sense of worthlessness. A sure knowledge of her own irrelevance and\ninsignificance. Memories bubbled out from her soul: times she’d failed,\ntimes she’d fallen short. Had she ever not failed? Had she ever not been\nworthless?\nShe’d spent her childhood hidden away by a father who was\nembarrassed by her. She’d spent her youth dreaming of far-off legends, only\nto make an utter fool of herself when one of those legends walked into her\nlife. Though Marasi’s romantic feelings for Wax were long since\nabandoned, the shame of how she’d thrown herself at him—to be rebuffed\n—was oppressive."

She’d always been nothing.\nWax let her join him because he felt bad for her. She’d lived in his\nshadow for years. Unable to find her own constable partner, so she’d needed\nto borrow his. Unable to solve important cases without his help.\nThe weight of it smothered her, reminding her of everything she was\nnot. And everything she would never be. And …\nAnd it was nothing new.\nShe’d felt it all before. Less powerfully, yes, but none of this was novel.\nShe’d lived with some of these fears for her entire life. Others she’d pushed\nthrough during her professional years. They were illogical.\nLogic didn’t matter. Just emotion. But she could handle that emotion.\nShe took a deep breath, whispered that it would soon pass, and shouldered\nit.\nShe could weather this.\nEntrone wasn’t so capable. He curled up on the green-painted stone\npatio and whimpered softly. All the regeneration powers in the world\nwouldn’t help if he couldn’t move—and without his aluminum-lined hat he\nwas completely subject to Armal’s control.\nSome soldiers came running up, but one of the other townspeople dealt\nwith them using what appeared to be a Soothing. It seemed that Armal had\nspread the Investiture around as Marasi had suggested.\nUltimately, the plan had worked. Marasi had succeeded in her primary\njob: empowering the people. She could rest now, and ride out the Rioting.\nExcept …\nExcept that portal was still opening. The invasion force was still\ncoming.\nThis worry—narrow, focused, cutting through her shame like a knife—\ndrove Marasi to focus. Because Marasi …\nMarasi could function.\nShe began moving, feeling as if she were crawling away from it: her\npain, her sorrow, her shame. With each grueling inch, she felt herself\ngrowing stronger. Shrugging off those lies. Embracing the person she’d\nbecome. A woman who didn’t care whose shadow she stood in—as long as\nthe job got done. A woman who didn’t care if her father, or society, was\nashamed of her—as long as she was confident in herself.\nA woman who could, painfully but determinedly, pass Entrone huddled\non the floor. And—with a breath of relief—get outside the directional force\nof Armal’s Rioting. The emotions vanished like smoke on a windy day.\nMarasi breathed out a long sigh, but there was no time to relax.\n“Be careful,” she said to one of the others as they came up to her.\n“Entrone is Metalborn. He can heal and has incredible strength.”\nMarasi wasn’t certain how long Armal’s power would last, but it seemed\nthat she’d been granted exceptional abilities—like when Vin had drawn in\nthe mists, as recorded in scripture.\nRusts.

She ignored the frozen\nguard. For him, this would all have passed in seconds. Perhaps he was still\nresponding to her dodging out of the way of his bubble— or maybe Entrone\nhad just ordered him to block the doorway.\nFortunately, the lord mayor had ripped her a new path. She pushed\nthrough the broken remnants of the wall, limped past the radio station, and\nstumbled up to the portal doorway. Most of the mansion, it turned out, was\na sham. The vast majority of the space was taken up by this one room with\nthe glowing floor. Radiant light had been poured into a pool twenty feet\nwide, and it was beginning to churn. Glowing brightly. Lighting the walls a\nghostly white.\nShe didn’t have to think hard to grasp the mythological implications of\nthis place. Rusts. That was raw, concentrated power. A single jar had given\nTwinSoul the power to create a stone body twelve feet tall, a second had\ntransformed Moonlight into another person, and a third had given Armal the\npower to Riot emotions like the Lord Ruler himself.\nThis pool had to hold thousands of jars’ worth of the power. She stepped\nforward, then felt the most awful premonition: she was close enough that\nshe saw them, in a place with a dark sky and misty ground. Thousands of\ninhuman soldiers with golden skin and glowing red eyes. Living statues.\nThey carried rifles of an advanced design, and their stares seemed to bore\nholes in her mind. The men of gold and red had arrived. Bearers of the final\nmetal, Miles had called them. Destroyers.\nMarasi stumbled back from the pool, daunted, as the pains of the fight\nstarted to flare up; the bruises and cuts from being thrown by Entrone.\nBut before the call of that power, her pain seemed distant.\nInconsequential. Once upon a time, she’d given up the Bands of Mourning.\nShe didn’t need to hold power like that.\nToday, she realized something else. She didn’t need power like that, but\nduty wasn’t about what you needed. It was about what was needed from\nyou.\nCenturies ago, the Last Emperor Elend Venture had been faced with a\nsimilar problem: how to dispose of a great deal of power. She knew what\nshe needed to do.\nA second later, she burst out of the building to find the clustered men\nand women of the Community speaking with the guards—calming them.\nArmal had finished tying up Entrone. He struggled, but strangely was\nunable to break free.\n“Macil is a Leecher,” Armal said, gesturing to one of the nearby women.\n“He might be able to heal, but we’ve sucked the strength out of him.”\nMarasi nodded, teeth gritted against the pain and the echoes of the\nRioting she’d survived. “I need every Allomancer in this cavern gathered\nhere, right now.”\n“Why?” Armal said, walking up to her.\n“There’s a well of power in the room nearby, and it’s opening a portal to\nsomething terrible,” Marasi said. “We’re going to stop it the old-fashioned"

If the enemy had any measure of foresight, they’d\nbe ready for incursions at those locations. They were still his best choice.\nThe higher he got, the less ground he’d need to cover inside, where he’d\nlikely have to fight for every inch.\nWax angled them toward a wide balcony with two broad, dark windows\nlooking into the structure. Wax’s Push—the anchor too far away—was\nbarely enough to get them to it, and they landed lightly amid some small\nplanters.\n“Aw…” Wayne said, dropping off his back. “We was supposed to go\nsmashing through that glass! All dramatic-like!”\n“That’s an excellent way to get cut to shreds,” Wax said, ducking to the\nside—out of sight of those windows. “I can’t heal. You can barely heal. And\nthere’s a door right there.”\n“The Ascendant Warrior did it,” Wayne grumbled.\n“When?”\n“Right before killin’ the Lord Ruler.”\n“Since when have you known that sort of thing?”\n“It’s in a little kids’ book that Max and I read sometimes,” he said.\n“Right about my level.”\nWax tried the door in the wall to the left of the large windows, but it was\nlocked. “Assassinating the Lord Ruler?” Wax asked. “Isn’t that a little\nviolent for a children’s book?”\n“Mate,” Wayne said, “it ain’t violence if it’s religion. Don’t you know\nanythin’?”\n“Apparently not,” Wax said. “I—”\nHe cut off as floodlights turned on in the room beyond, shining through\nthe windows with blazing intensity. Wax pulled up against the wall, Wayne\nnext to him. He dared a glance inside, and saw figures behind and between\nthe lights, their silhouettes raising weapons.\nGunfire cracked like thunder, shattering the window.\n“Damn,” Wayne said as the gunfire tapered off. “Those are soldiers,\nmate. I came down here to the Basin all those years ago ’cuz of a cute little\ncase involvin’ train cars what got robbed in a funny way. How in Ruin’s\nown name did I end up getting mixed up with dark gods, armies, bombs\ndestroyin’ cities, and … and ghosts, Wax. We still ain’t talked about the\nghosts.”\nWax unhooked the Big Gun from inside his coat, where he carried larger\nweapons while flying. “Can you keep their attention while I try to flank\nthem?”\nWayne smiled. “Scary Tree? We could do Scary Tree!”\n“Do you have enough health stored for Scary Tree?”\n“Mate, I don’t need health for Scary Tree,” Wayne said. “Just you\nwatch.”"

They had tunnel vision about fighting the\ninfamous lawman Coinshot. It was even worse these days—where news of\nhis exploits had been exaggerated by the broadsheets. He supposed that\nfinding and using the Bands of Mourning themselves hadn’t hurt his\nreputation.\nWhile everyone was distracted by Wayne, Wax unlocked the door with a\nquick Push from the side on the deadbolt. When he’d glanced in through the\nwindow earlier, he’d noticed that a wall separated the room with the\nsoldiers from wherever this door led. On cracking it open, he found a small\nhallway.\nIf he guessed right, their enemies would soon use this hallway to try\nreaching the balcony. So he slipped inside and Pushed himself up to the\nceiling directly above the door on the other side. He held there, using nails\nin the floor. As anticipated, a small group of armed men snuck into the\ndarkened hallway, light from the floodlights in the room beyond spilling in\naround them. Blinding them.\nIn the old days, Allomancers—Mistborn in particular—had been\nregarded like shadows. Or the mists themselves. Silent, hidden, practically\nformless. Wax could well understand the origins of those myths as the three\nsoldiers passed underneath him in a tight cluster. He dropped and disposed\nof them the old-fashioned way: a few coins flung in the air, delivered\nnoiselessly into their brains from behind. No crack of gunfire. No shouts of\npain. Just the thump of bodies on the floor.\nThey’d left the door open, and he peeked into the main room. Those\nfloodlights had been prepared for this and could move on wheels. Likely\nthey’d had scouts watching for Wax bounding over the buildings below, and\npositioned their ambush where they thought he’d enter.\nWayne’s distraction was working well. The soldiers had pushed the\nfloodlights into a line across the middle of the room and were arrayed in the\ngaps between them, shooting aluminum bullets.\nAs Wayne had noted, these people weren’t like the common street\ncriminals Wax and Wayne had fought earlier in the day, with their rough\nclothing, mismatched and rugged gear. These wore red uniforms and carried\nsleek weapons—modern rifles. They knelt with precise postures, firing\ncarefully. Several were slipping forward along the left side of the room to\nget an angle on Wayne.\nUnfortunately for them, they weren’t watching their own flanks. And\nwhile aluminum guns might not be affected by Steelpushes, the enormous\nfloodlights were. Tapping weight to make himself sturdier, Wax Pushed into\nthe room, smashing the lights into one another—and crushing the soldiers\nwho had set up between them."

Tapping weight to make himself sturdier, Wax Pushed into\nthe room, smashing the lights into one another—and crushing the soldiers\nwho had set up between them.\nHe crashed all of this into a mess against the far wall, then decreased his\nweight and slid across the ground, using nails in the wall behind as an\nanchor. On the other side of the room, he positioned himself and Pushed\nagain, sending some of the wreckage sweeping outward to catch the\nremaining soldiers—and sending them and the broken lights out the\nwindow into the mists.\nA moment later, Wayne sauntered into the now-darker room and tossed\nWax his mistcoat. “Sorry for the bullet holes.”\n“A few holes won’t…” Wax said, then noticed—in the weak light of the\nroom’s flickering ceiling light—that there had to be at least sixteen holes in\nit, even in some of the tassels. “How did you not get shot?”\n“By not bein’ where the bullets was,” Wayne said.\nWax threw on the mistcoat duster. He had three guns on him. The Big\nGun in his left hand. The Steel Survivor, aluminum but loaded with normal\nlead slugs. And Vindication, with aluminum bullets in the ordinary\nchambers and two hazekiller rounds ready for dealing with Metalborn.\n“We’re really going up the inside?” Wayne said.\nWax nodded. They would need proper climbing equipment to scale the\noutside, even if there weren’t Set sharpshooters around.\nWayne pulled out a dueling cane. Wax met his eyes and shook his head.\n“But—” Wayne said.\n“Harmony knew,” Wax said softly. “He knew what I’d need to become.”\nIt seemed he had a moment to pause, though more enemies would\nundoubtedly be on the way. So he reached into his pocket and took out a\nsmall sliver of metal. He slipped it into his ear, then carefully—\nritualistically—checked Vindication’s chambers to be certain there was a\nround in each.\nAs before, he felt a faint disconnect from the trellium earring. But he\ndidn’t see visions. He felt Telsin’s attention come on him, and heard—\nfaintly—what she was doing. Giving orders. Sounding frantic.\nShe was above. At the top. He could feel it.\nWaxillium, she said in his mind. You should have left the city as I\nsuggested.\nHe clicked to the next chamber of his gun. “I have come,” he said, “to\nclean up our family’s mess.”\nVery dramatic, she said. You—\n“Don’t make me do this. Don’t force it, Telsin.”\nShe didn’t reply at first. The only sound was that of him clicking,\nchamber to chamber.\nYou are still just a frightened child, Waxillium, she said. All these years\nlater, and you still can’t take a risk. Can’t see beyond your own limited\nmindset. I’m going to become something incredible.\n“I’ll see you dead first,” Wax said softly.\nWax, she said, you’re thirty floors away from me—and there are\nhundreds of soldiers from the Hidden Guard between us. My best. Reserved\nto stop you here.\nHe snapped Vindication closed."

Whatever you try, I’ll always be ahead\nof you.\nHe slipped Vindication into a holster, then downed an extra vial of steel\n—one of the ones Harmony had sent him. Finally, he hefted the Big Gun in\none hand. Ranette had warned him what it was capable of doing. So he put\nup his steel bubble, even though the enemy was armed with aluminum.\n“Funny, Telsin,” he said, “that you claim to be the one with vision—\nwhen you’ve always underestimated me. If you’d actually had foresight,\nyou’d have killed me when I first came back to the city seven years ago.”\nBefore you could learn what I was doing?\n“Before I came to love the things you’re seeking to destroy.”\nHe ripped the earring out and tossed it aside, then walked into the\nhallway and looked inward, toward where it ended at a cross hall. Footsteps\nand calls sounded from beyond a doorway there marked STAIRS. They went\nsilent a moment later.\n“Mate,” Wayne said, stepping up. “You’re sure about this?”\nWax raised his gun in two hands and strode forward. “Stay behind.\nFollow once I’m done. But don’t engage. It’s time for Harmony’s Sword to\ndo his job.”\n62\nWax strode toward the stairwell and slipped out the Steel Survivor, loaded\nwith ordinary lead bullets. He shot—then Pushed—twice, drilling a bullet\nthrough the wood on either side of the door. He was rewarded with shouts\nof pain from soldiers hiding within.\nTelsin assumed that if she stuffed enough soldiers between them, it\nwould slow him. But Wax was a Coinshot. The more you put between him\nand his goal, the more debris you gave him to turn into weapons.\nHe ripped a fire extinguisher off the wall next to him, then tossed it and\nPushed it forward—his weight increased—and ripped the door to the\nstairwell off the hinges, slamming it against the men hiding inside.\nPredictably, several others ducked through the opening to try shooting him.\nHe downed them each with a bullet to the head.\nThen he shot the fire extinguisher, blasting white smoke and chemicals\ninto the chamber. Finally, he lowered the Big Gun in his left hand and\nlaunched a shot. The massive explosive shell detonated amid the white\nsmoke, spraying shrapnel through the hallway and out around Wax—where\nhis steel bubble Pushed it away. He strode through the storm of steel\nuntouched.\nIt was a gun built just for him: a grenade launcher designed for\nmaximum shrapnel. And those it didn’t kill, it would outline. Wax stormed\nthrough the doorway, tracing the lines of steelsight across the chaotic space,\nand downed shadows that tried to aim at him through the smoke.\nLooking up through the smoke, he found a modern skyscraper stairwell.\nA straight shot to the top, assuming he could get past all the troops.

Like those he’d faced\nbefore, these were dressed in sleek uniforms and didn’t carry a trace of\nmetal on them. But Wax had plenty to work with regardless. The stairwell\nhad a metal banister and wrapped around itself, leaving a hole up the center.\nHe almost flew straight up it, but he couldn’t afford to leave enemies at his\nback. Plus he needed to carve a path for Wayne.\nSo, Wax launched a grenade up through the center of the stairwell,\nwhich detonated in another hail of shrapnel and screams. He launched\nupward, then Pushed outward, forcing the metal banister out and away from\nhim in a circle, pinning it to the wall—and taking any people still standing\nwith it. Indiscriminate firing started from above, so he dropped back down,\nnarrowly avoiding aluminum bullet hail. Another grenade—fired up through\nthe gap and detonated in exactly the right position by a careful Push—made\nthem curse and stop.\nHe dashed upward, keeping his momentum, and Pushed off a fuse box,\nthen a metal sign indicating the floor number. Sweeping up the steps, firing\n—yes—but just as often using chunks of metal debris as weapons. Grim, he\nadvanced, never touching down, building a wall of metal—bullet casings,\nshrapnel, debris—ahead of him as he continued to Push, constantly\nrepositioning, soaring up the stairs and bounding over corpses.\nOnce, Wax had run from his calling. He’d seen a duty that required him\nto not just find answers, not just solve problems, but to become something\nterrible. Something that Harmony—manacled by the powers of Preservation\n—couldn’t do himself.\nTonight Waxillium embraced that duty. He became destruction\nincarnate. For to worship Harmony was not only to worship Preservation—\nit was also to worship Ruin, with all that implied. There were times for\ncareful caution and empathy. And there were times when people pointed a\nweapon capable of killing millions straight at his home, his family, his\nconstituents.\nWax ascended the stairwell as a tempest, constantly seeking upward.\nToward the false heaven of a monstrous god. And as he did, he noticed mist\ntrickling down the steps—there was a small vent to the outside on each\nfloor. Enough for Harmony’s blood to spill in. It rarely came indoors, but it\ncoated the steps tonight like a ghostly liquid.\nMetal plinged. Metal he couldn’t see. He ducked back by instinct—and\na second later another explosion shook the stairwell. He found himself\nbleeding from shrapnel along one arm; they’d found grenades of their own.\nBut as the resistance pressed forward to stop him, they found him still quite\nhale.\nVindication aimed true, dispatching aluminum death. The enemy\nbunched up with wooden shields and furniture to block his way, but Wax\nlobbed a grenade into it, then used the wood—now embedded with steel\nfragments—and a Push to force them back. When they went down, Wax\nlanded behind the barricade and heard calls from above, giving him time to\nreload the Big Gun with another six grenades. He locked the weapon\nclosed, then gritted his teeth."

He locked the weapon\nclosed, then gritted his teeth.\nThese soldiers might have thought themselves prepared. They might\neven have fought Coinshots before.\nBut they’d never fought Waxillium Ladrian.\nHe had to take another hit of steel as he advanced. He was using it faster\nthan he expected. He dropped the vial as shouts above accompanied\nsoldiers throwing lines and nets across the central column to prevent him\nfrom flying up.\nWax pressed on, relentless. Heavy as a truck at some times, light as a\nbullet at others, he drove himself upward. Allomancy made the stairwell\ntremble—the concrete was reinforced with steel he could sense and use. It\nbent beneath his will, the concrete cracking, stairs rupturing and throwing\noff the aim of those trying to fire at him.\nTime seemed to slow as he hit the next batch of soldiers, and he avoided\ntheir gunfire, then increased his weight and lodged a bullet in one’s skull,\nthen slammed that person back into the others. He crumbled the steps\ncompletely beneath the feet of the next group.\nThis wasn’t about a case. This wasn’t about a mystery. This wasn’t\nabout questions. He couldn’t stop. He couldn’t afford to stop. If he did, life\nended. He fought with grenade, bullet, and steel. He fought as the sword,\nput where it needed to be. For all he hated that it was necessary.\nFinally—trailed by the mist, trailing death—he reached the top. The end\nof the stairwell. There didn’t appear to be a way up to the roof from here,\nbut he’d reached the top floor. Breathing heavily, he glanced down through\nthe center of the stairwell—flickering electric lights illuminating broken,\ncrumbling concrete, ripped apart as if by cannonballs. Railings twisted and\ncovered in wreckage.\nGroans, like the hollow moans of the damned, echoed up from below.\nWayne’s head popped out to look up at him from one floor down; he was\ncovered in dust and chips from the broken steps.\n“Did you know this was coming?” Wax whispered to Harmony. “Is this\nultimately why you brought me back to Elendel? Was this why you had\nLessie watch me? Did you always know?”\nThere was no answer, of course. Wax wasn’t pierced by the right metal\ncurrently, and couldn’t commune with God. Still, he felt as if he could feel\nHarmony trying to push through, trying to see. Fighting Trell’s influence.\n“Don’t ask me to do this again,” Wax whispered, turning away from the\ncarnage below. “This wasn’t an adventure. It was a massacre. I’ll finish the\njob, but don’t ask me again. Find yourself another sword. You don’t know\nhow this feels.”\nIn reply, he was given a distinct impression. Almost like a memory\nimplanted directly into his mind: an exhausted, overwhelmed man lying\nbroken on an ashen street, in front of a shattered city gate. Surrounded by\ndeath.\nWayne arrived a moment later, scrambling up the last cracked steps.\n“Mate,” he said softly, looking back down the stairs. “I ain’t … I mean …\nWow.”"

The\ntwo of them slipped into a large marble hallway, with fine pillars and lush\nred carpet. Another force was gathering at the far side, before a broad set of\ndouble doors. Wax and Wayne took cover behind a large pillar, but they’d\nbe flanked as soon as the troops moved forward.\nFortunately, this final group seemed to be the dregs of the enemy forces.\nSteelsight showed him few, if any, aluminum guns. Indeed it revealed metal\nweapons, zippers on clothing, keys in pockets. These people wore uniforms,\nbut not like the others—more security officer, less soldier.\nWax downed another metal vial and quickly reloaded, then … Rusts.\nThose cuts along his arm were throbbing. He pulled a self-clinging bandage\nfrom his pocket and wrapped it around his arm, best he could. Hopefully the\ndamage wasn’t too bad. His hand still worked fine.\n“They aren’t well armed,” he whispered to Wayne, “but there are a lot of\nthem. Building security, I’d guess. I’ll go—”\n“Stop,” Wayne said, holding his arm.\n“What?” Wax whispered.\n“These ones ain’t into it,” he said. Then as Wax frowned, he continued,\n“Those other ones, the ones who came down first? They wanted us dead.\nThey wanted to prove themselves. They wanted the fight. These poor sods?\nThese are the last defense. And they ain’t into it.”\n“You might be right,” Wax said. “But we have to keep moving. Telsin\ncould initiate the launch at any moment.”\nWayne nodded.\nThen he started shouting.\n63\n“Hey,” Wayne called loudly, his voice echoing in the marble room. “You\nall, out there? I know you!”\nWax gave him a glare, but Wayne ignored him. Wax knew a lotta things.\nBut tonight the fellow had become Ruin incarnate. Wax wasn’t wrong. But\nhe didn’t have to be right neither.\n“I know you!” Wayne shouted, louder.\nThe hall fell quiet save for the clinking of weapons and the shuffling of\nfeet. Wax glanced out from the side of the stone pillar, perhaps thinking he\nmight use Wayne’s voice as a distraction. Wayne grabbed his friend’s arm,\nthen shook his head.\n“I know you,” Wayne continued loudly, looking up toward the ceiling.\n“Yeah. I know how you feel. You’re guards. Watchmen. Fellows what was\nhired to protect the building. You don’t know about this nonsense—about\ncities being destroyed, about dark gods. Sure, you seen creepy stuff, but you\nain’t here for that. You’re here to put coin in your pocket the honest way.\n“You were supposed to go home tonight. Hug your kids. Have a meal—\nmaybe cold, but filling. You were supposed to go drinkin’ with buddies, or\nget a good night’s sleep for once.\n“But now, here you are. Gun in hand. Wonderin’ how you got where you\nare.

Now there aren’t any of them left.”\nWayne let that thought linger. The room had gone so quiet you could\nhave heard a man cock a pistol from a hundred paces. Wayne squeezed his\neyes shut, remembering. Feeling. Then he continued, softer.\n“Yeah, here you are,” he said. “Your hand is slick on the grip of your\ngun. Your heart, it feels like it’s tryin’ to rip outta your chest and run away.\nBut you think, ‘I ain’t got no choice. I signed up for this. I gotta shoot.’\n“You’re wrong.

It will\nfollow you your whole damn life.” He paused. “Anyway, I just wanted to\nsay my piece. I hope there’s one that listened. When we come out, if you\ngot your gun holstered and you’re makin’ for that escape route in the\nchaos … well, we ain’t gonna aim for you first.”\nHe looked at Wax, who pulled his bandage tight, then nodded back.\nHe’d dropped the Big Gun; it was out of ammo. But he raised his regular\nrevolver, armed and ready.\nSometimes you needed what he’d done. You needed a sword. But\nWayne figured sometimes you needed something else. A shield? Or maybe\nthat was too poetic. He didn’t know much about poetry.\nSometimes what you needed was a guy who had been there before.\nThe two ducked out from behind the pillar, weapons out, and saw a\nwhole host of people pushing and scrambling to get through that exit. Wax\nlowered his gun, dumbfounded, and Wayne grinned as every damn person\nleft.

Wax shared a look with\nWayne, then they walked to the large wooden doors at the far end and threw\nthem open, to reveal a grand staircase leading up to some kind of ballroom\nwith a skylight. Standing at the top were a man in a suit and a woman with\na bowler hat, her head completely healed, flipping a dueling cane in one\nhand and trying her best—but failin’ somethin’ awful—to imitate a Wayne\ngrin.\n“These idiots again?” Wayne said with a sigh. “All right. I’ll tackle the\none with the hat. You—”\n“No,” Wax said softly.\n“No?”\n“No,” Wax repeated. “They were built and trained to defeat us. That\nman knows exactly how to hunt me.”\n“So…” Wayne grinned. “I take the fellow, you take the woman?”\n“Damn right,” Wax said, smiling. “Remember he’s a Leecher. Don’t get\ntoo close, or he’ll wipe out your Allomantic abilities.”\n“Mate,” Wayne said, “I’m depending on it. Let’s do this.”\n64\nThe Allomantic grenades in Marasi’s hands vibrated so powerfully, she\nthought they’d shake her flesh free of her bones. The Allomancers from the\nCommunity gathered around the edges of the glowing pool, which was\nrapidly vanishing—their hands thrust in to touch it, draw it in. Their skin\nglowed as they filled with power.\nMarasi had waded straight into the middle. And she could feel those\ntroops on the other side, in a place that was somehow distant and\nimpossibly close at the same time. Waiting.\nShe needed this power gone. Now. Marasi continued to draw in strength,\ncharging her grenades. She had no idea how much they could hold. She’d\nnever had access to this kind of strength before.\n“It’s too much!” a man cried. “What do I do with it!”\n“Burn it!” Marasi shouted. “Use it!”\n“For what?”\n“It doesn’t matter!” Marasi yelled. “We only need to get rid of it!”\nBursts of emotional Allomancy washed over her as Armal used her\npowers to Riot. Metal in the radio room vibrated and ripped apart. The\nAllomancers in the room channeled every bit of energy they could.\nThe pool shrank further. Marasi thought—through the blasts of\nconfidence Armal sent—that she could sense the troops on the other side\ngetting agitated. Then she felt something different. Something emerging.\nThey were coming through. She understood it in a flash—you had to want\nto come through the portal. To command it to let you through. They were\nbeginning the process.\nNo you don’t, she thought. Then she dropped both her grenades, and\nused the same mental command to open the portal to them.\nThe movement on the other side stopped. Frozen in time as the\nAllomancers around her continued—wide eyed—drawing from the pool.\nSiphoning away the awesome power until, at last, the glow faded. The room\nwas suddenly a normal ballroom again, with a hewn-out rock pit in the floor\nsome three feet deep.\nShe was left with one final impression from the other side. Shock."

She had\nnever thought that using their powers would be so much work, but she felt\nwrung out as well. Not simply from what they’d done here— but from all of\nit, taking place in such a short time.\nShe limped to the edge of the pit and let them help her out.\n“… Now what?” Armal finally asked.\n“Now,” Marasi said, lying back on the rock, “we hope that my friends\nhave had an easier time of it than I have.”\n65\nFigures, Wayne thought, dashing up the steps. Wax would want me to face\nthe evil version of him. While he gets the easy job. My evil twin probably\nspent the afternoon drinkin’. She’ll be a snap. Especially since she’d gotten\nher face half blown off earlier in the day.\nThe steps led to a large ballroom, with red-carpeted floor and no\nfurniture. A skylight kept out the mist above, but for the most part this was a\nwide-open room with high ceilings and no obstacles. No cover either. The\ntwo backed away a little as Wayne and Wax charged up the steps—Wax\ndoing a steel-assisted flying leap at the end, because of course he did.\nWayne kept his eyes on the woman, pretending he was going to engage\nher. As soon as he drew close though, he broke to the left and tackled the\nCoinshot. The man cried out in shock as Wayne knocked them both to the\ncarpeted floor.\nRusts. His cologne smells terrible.\nThe man scrambled to get free, but Wayne took hold of his suit coat and\nclung on. Wayne knew how to fight beside Wax, which translated into\nknowing how to fight against him. Gotta stay close to Wax, otherwise he’d\ndo something smart, like fly up high and shoot you till you died of it.\nThe man grunted, trying to pry Wayne off, seeming baffled by the whole\nexperience as they wrestled on the ground. Eventually he put his hand on\nWayne’s face and Leeched him—the bendalloy in Wayne’s stomach\nvanishing.\nWayne grappled anyway, trying for a headlock, but the man was strong.\nToo strong.\n“You know,” Wayne said, “you’re too handsome to be a copy of Wax.\nYou oughta get a scar or something.”\nThe man tried to seize Wayne’s hand and pry it free, but Wayne let go\nwith that hand—then grabbed the man with the other, grinning, staying\nclose.\n“You miscreant!” the man growled. “Go and fight Getruda, as is your\ntask. I must prove myself against Ladrian!”\n“Why?” Wayne said as he tried to get his arm around the man’s neck—\nbut also palmed a bit of bendalloy and popped it into his mouth. “Why do\nyou two have this freakish obsession with copying us?”\n“Survival,” the man said with a grunt, “of those most worthy.

Against adversity. Against\nsociety. Against the roles we take.

To find our place in the coming pantheon of rulers,\nwe must be the best versions of ourselves. It is not we who are copying you,\nbut you who seek to take the places which are rightfully ours.”\nWayne shifted positions, but then felt something tremble on the front of\nthe man’s coat. Wayne rolled out of the way as one of the man’s buttons—\nmetal, evidently—burst free and shot off like a bullet.\n“Damn,” Wayne said, rolling over. “Did you steal that button trick from\nWax?”\nThe man stood, glaring at Wayne while pulling a gun from his holster.\n“Of course you stole it from him…” Wayne said. “You really are tryin’\nto become him. I thought you weren’t as freaky as the not-me over there,\nbut you’re just more classy about it, eh?”\nThe man started firing, but Wayne tossed up a speed bubble.\nAnticipating the look of shock on the man’s face when he found out that\nWayne still had his Allomancy, he repositioned.\n* * *\nThe essential trick to defeating the not-Wayne, Wax knew, would be staying\nclose enough to her that she couldn’t leverage her speed bubbles. So when\nWayne broke left, Wax broke right, surprising the short, squat woman in the\nbowler hat.\n“Oi!” she said. “That’s not fair! Fight someone your own size! Or at\nleast your own stench!”\nShe tossed up a speed bubble moments before Wax drew close enough\nto be within its perimeter. From his perspective, she became a blur of\nmotion. Fortunately, he’d worked with Wayne long enough to know what to\ndo. He changed his trajectory and shot the floor with an ordinary bullet. As\nshe came out of the blur, leaping for him, he Pushed himself out of the way\nto avoid getting hit by a dueling cane.\n“Oi!” she said. “Stand in one place so I can clobber ya in a fair-type\nmanner, ya rustin’ sod.”\n“Is that the best you can do?” Wax said, backing away—dodging her\nstrikes but staying close enough to be inside a speed bubble if she made\none. “Really, I thought you’d be harder than this.”\n“Stop quotin’ lines from your wife last night,” she snapped, “and fight\nme!”\nShe tossed up another speed bubble, catching Wax—but making it\nappear that Wayne and the Coinshot were frozen mid-conflict. Wayne was\nwrestling the fellow for some reason.\nWhatever. Wax shot the woman as she drew close, but she barely\nflinched. She seemed to have a lot of health stored up—and that made sense\nif she’d begun preparing to fight him and Wayne years ago."

She seemed to have a lot of health stored up—and that made sense\nif she’d begun preparing to fight him and Wayne years ago.\nHe jumped back, floating on a slight Steelpush to the perimeter of the\nspeed bubble, where the air shimmered. He had to separate her from her\nmetalminds. Wax clicked Vindication to a chamber with a hazekiller round,\nthough she’d healed from the last one of those he’d hit her with.\nWhere to shoot her? He’d memorized the Hemalurgy book Death had\nsent them, but it would be hard to blast her spikes off her, as she would be\nwearing them deep in her core. Her healing power came from her\nmetalminds though, and many surgeries embedded those in arms or legs. A\npin through the arm bones was easier to recover from than one in the chest,\nand easier to swap out if required.\nShe growled and dropped the speed bubble, then attacked—clearly\ntrying to get him to dodge too far out. But his years beside Wayne had given\nhim a gut instinct for the precise distance to stay from her—which\nunfortunately meant he had to stay dangerously close to her attacks. During\nhis next jump to get past her, he had to stay low enough that she was able to\nget a solid hit on his leg. It didn’t break anything thankfully, but rusts did it\nhurt.\nShe saw that and grinned wickedly. “Oh, that pain. That pain is\ndelicious. Get in here. That was just an appetizer.”\n* * *\nWayne stayed wary, putting up a speed bubble and watching the Coinshot\ntry to take aim at him. That trick with the button worried Wayne. His\nremaining stored-up health would probably let him survive a hit or two, but\nnot much more. He felt so exposed.\nI have to watch out for that super-metal he has too, Wayne thought.\nOr … actually … that’s probably my best way of beating him …\nAfter gauging the direction the man was swinging his arm as he aimed,\nWayne repositioned and dropped the bubble. A series of bangs sounded as\nthe man’s shots missed. Then Wayne dodged in from the other direction and\ntackled him again. This time the man managed to keep his feet.\nWayne grunted. “You know, Stinky—can I call you Stinky?—I can\nrespect what you’re doin’. Gettin’ into a man’s head to figure out how to\nbeat him? That’s good strategy. But…”\nThe man Leeched away Wayne’s bendalloy, then shoved Wayne off and\nstarted punching, his face turning red with anger. Wayne dodged the blows,\nthen leaped forward and grabbed him yet again.\n“But weren’t you worried?” Wayne continued. “About contamination?\nWax, you see, isn’t a complete waste of a person. While you obviously are.\nSo by pretendin’ to be him, you might have accidentally ended up doin’\nsomething useful.”\nThe man growled, shoving Wayne aside, then fired a few shots. Wayne\ntook one of those—ouch—but managed another hit of bendalloy. That was\nthe key. People expected a man like him to run out of such an expensive\nmetal.\nBut the fellow didn’t know.

He was fighting Wayne Terrisborn, filthy rich snob with\nway, way too much money to burn.\n“You know I can heal, right?” Wayne said after dodging back out of a\nspeed bubble. “Shootin’ me is kinda stupid.”\n“Not if it hurts,” the man snapped, though he stopped firing. Mistake\nthat, lettin’ Wayne talk him out of it. He couldn’t know that Wayne was\nrunning low on health—but then in general, you beat a Bloodmaker by\nmakin’ them use up their metalminds.\nInstead, the man fished in his pocket and brought out a pair of what\nseemed to be aluminum handcuffs. Wayne swallowed a wisecrack. That …\nwas actually a good idea. If he could grapple with Wayne for long enough\nto lock him to something, then get away, he could shoot Wayne full of\nbullets at his leisure. The only way out would be for Wayne to cut his own\nhand off.\nAs he was considering, the man gestured at Wayne with the cuffs—\nwhich he didn’t need to do, but Wayne could admire the nice pose—and\nreleased a terrible wave of Allomantic strength, one that ripped the carpet\nup by its staples and sent Wayne tumbling backward.\nRusts. Even his metalminds—embedded beneath the skin of his thighs\n—felt those blasts. Still, Wayne had been ready for it. So he pretended to be\ndazed, but instead watched keenly as the man covertly pulled an aluminum\nflask from his inner coat pocket and took a hit. Wax had said every time the\nfellow used that super-Push, he’d have to replenish his steel.\nNow I know where you keep that flask, friend.\nWith another speed bubble, Wayne rushed in close. The man groaned as\n—once again—Wayne grabbed on to him.\n“You annoying little prick,” the man snapped.\n“Oh, mate,” Wayne said. “You sweet mama’s baby.” He pulled in closer.\n“You ain’t even begun to learn how annoying I can be.”\n* * *\n“I’m supposed to like the pain,” the woman said, circling Wax as they\ncontinued their dance—him trying to stay just far enough from her to avoid\nbeing hit, but not so far as to give her a chance to back up and make a speed\nbubble. “That’s something I didn’t know about him. Learned it recently, ya\nknow? In the tunnel? He likes pain. I have to like pain. Enjoy fear. Savor\nmisery.”\nWax didn’t reply, focused on keeping the right distance.\n“Do ya know why?” the woman asked, feinting in, making Wax hop\nbackward. “I didn’t at first. Freaked me out! I hadn’t seen that innim. More\nI thought though, the more it made sense. He must like the pain. Otherwise\nhe’d have ended things long ago. It’s the only answer that makes any\nsense.”\nShe lunged, and he dodged a little too far, because she broke and threw\nherself the other direction, rolling to the ground and becoming a blur.

Wax\ncursed, dancing away—noticing something from the corner of his eye that\nmade him feel comfortable backing up. A moment later, his back pressed up\nagainst Wayne’s.\n“So, how’re things?” Wayne said.\n“Could be better,” Wax replied.\n“I hear you,” Wayne grumbled, giving them a speed bubble. “Wanna try\nsomething new? Shake it up?” He waggled one of his dueling canes in his\nhand.\n“Sure.”\nWayne tossed a dueling cane into the air, and Wax tossed him\nVindication, loaded with aluminum bullets. “Ignore the hazekiller\nchambers,” Wax said, snatching the cane from the air. “Lever on the top\nactivates those.”\nThe bubble dropped, and Wax met Getruda with dueling cane against\ndueling cane—a crack of wood nearly as loud as Vindication, as Wayne\ntook a few shots at Dumad.\nWax smiled at the sound. It was in some ways silly to enjoy hearing his\nfriend fire the gun. But it wasn’t the action that mattered. It was the wound\nthat had finally healed.\nWax parried the next set of dueling cane blows. She was better than he\nwas—but this change-up obviously had her confused. She started at him in\na more defensive posture, and he was able to briefly fend her off, then\ndeliver a strike on her thigh. Looking for where her metalminds were\nembedded deep under the skin, where Allomancers couldn’t interfere with\nthem.\nNot either thigh, he thought, hitting again. She, like Wayne, seemed not\nto mind the hits. Indeed, her eyes flashed with pain at each one, and her\nsmile widened. At the same time, she didn’t have the wild sense of pleasure\nhe’d seen from some who truly enjoyed pain. She was trying to brute-force\ntrain herself to think like she believed Wayne did.\nIn some ways, that was even more disturbing.\nShe eventually came in more aggressively, and after he took a hit on his\nside—one that might have bruised a rib—he forced himself to retreat. His\narm was still aching from the shrapnel earlier, and rusts … he was\nbeginning to wear out.\nSo when Wayne came past him, Wax tossed him the cane back and\ncaught Vindication as Wayne threw it. He’d fired all but the hazekiller\nrounds.\n“More dodgin’ and hittin’?” the woman asked Wax with a yawn. “I\ndon’t really mind, as it’s fun watchin’ you squirm. But I would rather not\nwaste all night.”\nWax needed to try something different. So with steelsight, he located a\nsuitable piece of metal: a doorstop by a nearby door. He leaped over and\ngrabbed it, then turned back as the woman came at him in a blur.\nTime to try something old-fashioned.\n* * *\nWayne landed another grapple on the Coinshot. The man had given up\nburning away Wayne’s metals, and tried something smart. He took to the air\n—forcing Wayne to hold on tightly as he dangled. The Coinshot fired into\nthe skylight, then they smashed through into the dark misty air. As they did,"

As they did,\na shard of glass sliced the fellow along the arm something fierce.\nHuh, Wayne thought. Look at that.\nThe wound didn’t heal. He wasn’t a Bloodmaker. So there was some\nlimit on the number of spikes the Set could stick inna person. Or maybe\nTrell/Telsin just didn’t want them to be so powerful they could challenge\nher.\nBeing in the air let Wayne control the fight far less; he really had to hold\non, since if he dropped from up here—well, healing that would take\nbasically all Wayne had. The need to hold on with both hands let the guy\nsnap the handcuffs around one of Wayne’s wrists. Rusts.\nWayne did get a glimpse of the apparatus set up on the rooftop though,\namong the construction. It included a long, sleek weapon that looked an\nawful lot like … well, a sausage. And sausages looked like a fellow’s knob.\nThat had to be the rocket, and it hadn’t been launched yet, which was a\nvery good sign. Wax’s sister stood there among some engineers, wearing\njacket and cravat, the mists staying far away from her—like she had an\ninvisible glass bubble. Her waiting with hands clasped behind her back, and\nstaring off into the darkness … that seemed a bad sign.\nThe Coinshot let them go down lower, then used a Push off some\napparatus to jerk them forward, then another Push sent them backward. The\njarring motion dislodged Wayne, who dropped with a grunt of annoyance to\nthe rooftop. Not far enough to need much healing, but still.\nDamn, damn, damn.\nWell, if the fellow was going to fight dirty, Wayne could do the same.\nGranted, Wayne would fight dirty anyway, but he felt better about it in\nmoments like this. He ran toward the broken skylight, where hopefully he\ncould drop down to help Wax fight Getruda.\n* * *\nWax used the metal doorstop like a bludgeon, Pushing it at the woman. She\ndodged by instinct, as something that large would hurt more than a bullet.\nWax leaped over her as she rolled, then he Pushed the doorstop toward\nher again, hitting her in the arm and snapping bones.\nShe growled, agony breaking through her facade. It made her stumble\nand slow momentarily as she waited to heal—which let Wax reposition and\nshove the doorstop straight into her foot, shattering bones there too.\nIt bounced to the side, and he used a Push to soar in that direction, grab\nit, and shoot it again. By then she’d healed and managed to get out of the\nway—but this weapon made her keep dodging. Whenever she was\ndistracted, or the bludgeon fell far enough away to be awkward retrieving\nimmediately, he hit her with a bullet Pushed from his fingers. He didn’t\npause to reload. He just kept beating her down.\nHer quips trailed off. He grabbed a chunk of metal from the broken\nskylight and used that too.

Soon she\nseemed more angry than anything else, and she kept trying to find a way to\nengage him directly.\nWax didn’t let her. He cut the woman on one side. Then the other. Then\nhe delivered a bullet directly into her arm—and caught sight of a glimmer\nof metal. The wound healed over in a moment, but he knew what he’d seen.\nHer metalmind.\nA second later, Wayne came thumping down from above, breathing\nheavily and muttering under his breath. Wax reached out and had his fingers\nin the right place to be inside the bubble when it appeared. Since any part of\nyour body touching the perimeter would work to hold you in it, with that\nbrush of the fingertips he was able to step in and join Wayne.\n“Mate,” Wayne said, “fightin’ you is rustin’ hard.”\n“Likewise,” Wax said.\n“It’s fun though,” Wayne noted. “He’s real annoyed.”\n“Well,” Wax said, “I’ll admit I’ve often wanted an excuse to shoot\nsomeone short, with an exaggerated accent, wearing a bowler hat.”\nWayne eyed him.\n“It’s the oddest thing,” Wax said. “Can’t rightly say what causes it.\nInstinct, I guess.”\n“I wear a coachman’s hat,” Wayne grumbled, shaking his hand—which\nhad a handcuff on it. “It’s different.” He took a deep breath, then pointed\ntoward the sky, where Dumad was hiding in the mists. “I need to draw him\nback down. Shall we?”\nWax nodded, and as the speed bubble dropped they both made for the\nwoman. This drew the Coinshot’s attention, as he couldn’t afford to let his\nally be double-teamed. He landed back on the carpet, then released a\nbarrage of Pushed bullets. As he did, Wax tossed Wayne a chunk of metal,\nthen used a careful Push to separate the two of them. The bullets soared\nthrough the space between them.\nWax turned back to the woman, as his Push had put him closest to her.\nShe had healed from the hits she’d received, but she appeared to be\nslowing, gasping for breath, covered in sweat. He knew that feeling. He\nached in a dozen places, and even the adrenaline from the fight was fading\nbefore the exhaustion of an entire day spent racing a deadline.\nHe raised Vindication, hazekiller round chambered.\n“Can you at least tell me why?” he said. “Why are you so fixated on\nimitating him? This goes further than trying to know your enemy.”\nShe drew in a ragged breath. “You ever been nothin’, Dawnshot?”\nBefore he could reply, she shook her head. “No. You’ve always been\nsomebody. Had two names. Even when you ran, you still had the money …\nthe knowledge … a life spent knowin’ that you were in charge of yourself.\nRunning away was a luxury for someone like you.” She paused, flipping\none of her dueling canes and catching it. “Well, we don’t all have that.\nSome of us, we take the chances we’re given.

I don’t know you, but I can\npromise you this: They’ve lied to you. Trell, the Set. They’ve lied. You are\nsomebody. And someone out there misses you.”\nShe grinned. “They said you’d get into our heads. They said it! But see,\nI’m smarter than you think. I got into your heads first.”\nShe came running at him. Wax turned Vindication a fraction of a degree\nand pulled the trigger—delivering the hazekiller round into her right\nshoulder. The secondary blast came a moment later.\nRipping her arm clean off.\nShe lurched to a stop, gaping at the wound. It didn’t heal, as that arm\nhad held the metalmind that stored her healing. She might have another\nmetalmind elsewhere—having several was smart—but if so, he’d forced her\nto use enough healing to drain it. Because the arm didn’t heal.\nThe wound was gruesome, but not as bad as one might imagine. Head\nwounds bled a ton, but if you separated a limb … well, it was awful. Yet\nthere was always less blood than he expected.\nShe looked to him, almost pleading, but kept running at him. So, with a\nsigh, he tossed a bullet in the air and delivered it into her head with a\nsurgical Push.\nHer body dropped. Wax sighed, feeling wrung out. Now … where had\nWayne run off to?\n* * *\nThe Coinshot raised his hand toward Wayne, preparing to do his trick with\nthe super-Push again.\nWayne braced himself, then got pushed back into a heap, barely raising\na speed bubble in time. He glanced up and saw a bullet inching through the\nair about a finger’s width from the edge of the bubble. He rolled aside as it\nbroke through the barrier, deflecting in the process, and went zipping past\nhim.\nRight. Okay. He gritted his teeth and launched forward, dropping the\nspeed bubble and charging the fellow. Not-Wax was expecting this, of\ncourse. Wayne had pulled this trick multiple times. The guy flung out some\nbullets, which Wayne dodged.\nResigned, not-Wax raised a hand to begin grappling Wayne.\nWho hit him square in the face with a dueling cane instead, smashing\nhis nose. The man cursed and backed up, bloodied.\n“Yeah,” Wayne said, “that’s better. Not so pretty anymore.”\nThe man howled, raising his gun.\nWayne slapped the free side of the handcuffs down on the man’s wrist.\nThe Coinshot, bleeding from both face and arm, gaped at this. Then, after\nletting out a howl of rage and frustration, he Pushed them into the air with a\npowerful force. Exactly as Wayne had hoped, though the force of the launch\nnearly ripped his arm out of its socket.\nHe dangled off the fellow, then grabbed on and climbed his body,\nholding his coat as they shot high, high, high into the air.

That super-metal—duralumin, it had\nbeen called?—was really something.\n“You know,” Wayne said over the howling wind, “your problem is that\nyou specialized too much!”\nThe man grabbed Wayne by the throat, no longer bothering with the\nguns. They continued to rise, then exploded from the top of the mists into a\nland bathed in starlight.\n“You did everything you could to learn to fight Wax,” Wayne said, “but\nyou didn’t train to defeat me. That says you’ve been too single-minded. You\nshould pick up a hobby or somethin’!”\nThey finally crested the height of the Push and began to drop. As they\nhit the mists again, the man shoved Wayne free, leaving him to dangle by\nthe handcuff. With his other hand, not-Wax reached into the inside pocket\nof his jacket.\nHe came out with a yellow handkerchief, a bunny sewn in the corner.\n“I suggest,” Wayne called up to him, “taking up pickpocketing. It’s\nrusting useful!”\nAnd with that, Wayne tossed the man’s aluminum flask full of metals\naway into the darkness.\nThe man watched it go, his eyes widening in horror. The wind picked up\nagain as they fell. The man scrambled, searching his body frantically.\n“No others?” Wayne shouted. “Too bad!”\nNot-Wax reached for Wayne as the two of them plummeted, his eyes\nbloodshot and enraged. But fallin’, it happened fast. Faster and faster, the\nmore you did it. Wayne had always wondered why that was.\n“Hey!” Wayne shouted. “When you meet Death—”\nThey crashed through the skylight, then slammed to the floor with a\ncrunch.\nAll went black.\nA few minutes later, Wayne blinked open his eyes and groaned. The\nhealing he’d stored had been enough. Barely. He rolled over and looked at\nthe Coinshot’s crumpled, broken body.\n“Aw, man,” he muttered. “We dropped too fast. I didn’t get to say my\nawesome line.”\nHe found the keys to the handcuffs in the man’s pocket, and unlocked\nhimself. Ruin, his body hurt. He’d have bruises something fierce in the\nmorning. The metalmind had repaired the worst parts first, and saved him\nfrom dyin’. But it hadn’t been enough for anything more than an economy-\nclass-type healing, and now he was all tapped out.\n“When you see Death,” Wayne said, kicking the corpse in the side, “tell\nhim he owes me fifty clips.”\nHe wandered over to Wax, who had removed the metalminds from the\ndisembodied arm of the woman who absolutely was not a clone of Wayne.\nTakin’ those out was smart. There were stories of Compounding\nBloodmakers regrowing a whole damn body from a limb that got ripped off.\n“We should remove their spikes too,” Wayne said. “Just in case.”\n“Let’s stop the bomb first.”\n“Your sister is up there,” Wayne warned. “With the rocket thing, ready\nto shoot off.”\n“Right, then,” Wax said.

Best way to fight someone maybe a little like me, in purely\nsuperficial ways.”\n“I couldn’t. She would have run out the time. I needed to stay in close,\nforce her to engage me.”\nHuh.

Shaped like a bent nail. A religious icon for a Pathian, but to him,\nso much more.\nHe rarely put it in, except when he had to. Tonight he hooked it into his\near, and then he whispered something.\n66\n“I did my part,” Wax whispered. “I became your sword. I want you to do\nyour part now.”\nMy part, Harmony said in his head, is to put you where you can—\n“No,” Wax said, reloading quickly while staring up at the mists. “Not\ngood enough. Not damn near good enough, Sazed. I can kill men. I’m far\ntoo good at that. But I can’t kill a god. If Autonomy intervenes, I will need\nyou.”\nAutonomy won’t intervene, he said. It’s not our way, as it exposes us. She\nhas Invested your sister, but mostly to let Telsin communicate with her\nfollowers and visualize plans in greater complexity than an ordinary\nhuman. She will not fight you. You won’t win this next part with bullets.\n“Can I kill Telsin?”\nI’m counting on you trying to. But … I’m not certain. She might be so\nhighly Invested that you can’t. If so, Telsin will die only if Autonomy\nwithdraws her power.\n“I’m still going to want your help.”\nI—\n“What can you do?”\nI … I do not know. I can perhaps stun her. Briefly interrupt her\nConnection to Autonomy. Maybe.\n“Be ready,” Wax said, raising his reloaded gun in one hand, then seized\nWayne by the arm. Wayne nodded and held on. Wax Pushed off the nails in\nthe carpet, sending them soaring up into the mists and onto the rooftop.\nWax felt better immediately, entering the mists. His fatigue washed\naway, his pains fading. The mist was something ancient, older than\nHarmony. It had seen the Ascendant Warrior and the Last Emperor stop the\nend of the world. It had seen the Lord Ruler rise before that, and protected\n—perhaps threatened—the world when it had been new.\nYou’ve done something to me, Wax thought at Harmony, nudging them\nto the side and landing on the roof.

Behind Telsin was a\nhulking contraption with the rocket on top. Hidden from sightlines below\nby the “construction” at the perimeter of the rooftop, it was bathed in\nfloodlights. Engineers worked on it furiously, sparing him nervous glances.\n“Wayne,” Wax hissed, gun trained on Telsin, “go help those engineers\ntake a lunch break.”\n“Gladly,” Wayne said, hurrying over. It didn’t take much work to get\nthem corralled into a corner.\nWax stood there, gun on Telsin, feeling … unnerved. He’d made it this\nfar. He’d found the rocket. This should be it, shouldn’t it?

Now you’re\ngoing to let me destroy Elendel.”\n“Like hell I will,” Wax growled.\n“What would you give up, Waxillium,” she said, “to save a planet? How\nmany people are you willing to sacrifice to do what needs to be done?”\nShe stepped closer. He cocked Vindication, thrusting it forward. Rusts.\n“Autonomy likes you,” Telsin said. “She called you a masterpiece. I\ndisagreed, but here you are, and I find myself persuaded. Harmony knows\nhe’s growing impotent, that Discord is near, and so he created you. A sword.\nWho can act when he cannot.”\nShe stepped closer, ignoring Vindication. And why shouldn’t she?\nHarmony had said the gun wouldn’t do anything. Her smile as she advanced\nreminded him of when she’d turned on him. Of how it had felt to be\nbetrayed by his last living kin.\nThat moment.

He needed to defeat that as much as he did\nher.\n“Do you think Harmony could do it?” Telsin asked, gesturing to the\nrocket. “If this were the only way to protect the people of this world? Could\nhe sacrifice one city to save the rest? Or would indecision freeze him? Like\na constable on their first day on the job.”\nRusts.

And yet Telsin was so\nrusting confident.\nYou’re not merely a sword, Wax, he thought. You’re a detective. That’s\nthe life you chose. Be the person you decided to be. Not the one you’ve been\nassigned to be.\nWax focused his thoughts, pushing away the pain of betrayal. Think. You\nfound those charts of launches. None of them could travel far enough. So …\nHe lowered his gun. “It doesn’t work.”\nTelsin froze.\n“The delivery device,” he said. “All this time, and it still can’t lift a\nbomb this big, can it? You’d have fired it by now if it could.”\nTelsin shrugged.\nThe detective in him grasped for connections. If she legitimately thought\nthat the world would end if she didn’t destroy Elendel, she’d have launched\nit anyway. On the hope that it worked. Because if she failed, everything\nended anyway—so why not try?\nFeeling cold, Wax raised his hand and increased his weight. Then he\nPushed against the rocket. The whole construction collapsed, and the\nenormous weapon—the bomb—hit the rooftop with a resounding, hollow\nclang.\nIt was a decoy.\nTelsin’s eyes went wide.\nHe turned and looked across the city, softly blanketed in mist, made\nindistinct—like a dream. Here in the mists he could think; he could make\nthe connections that had eluded him all day. Where was the bomb?\nThey’d been planning this for years … waiting until the delivery device\nwas ready. Building the launchpad high to give themselves the best chance.\nThose were the right threads. He’d followed the correct clues.\nProblem was, in the end, they hadn’t been able to get it working. So\nwhen Wax had arrived earlier in the day, they’d panicked. They’d moved\ntheir bomb somewhere else. But where? Surely they weren’t going to\ndeliver it by train or by road. Too obvious. Plus, he’d told Steris to close\nboth routes into the city. So what? They had to move and install their bomb\non a new delivery device. So …\nThe docks, Wax realized, pieces clicking into place. They were genuinely\nsurprised when I located the tunnel from the mansion. Why put their lab out\nthere near the docks, instead of secure in this tower or one of the caverns?\nBecause they had another delivery method, a backup. In case the rocket\nnever worked. And when I arrived in town they acted, taking the bomb from\nhere to …\nHe spun, searching the darkness, and somehow he was able to see\nthrough the mist. As if it thinned just for him.

I’m … not sure how I feel about that.”\nWax’s mind raced. How to stop it? He rushed up to the edge of the roof,\nlooking between the steel rods of the construction facade.\n“Wax?” Wayne asked, hurrying up. “Nearly gave me a heart attack when\nyou toppled that bomb there. What’s going on?”\n“The rockets never worked,” he muttered. “Not well enough.”\n“Autonomy wanted to figure them out,” Telsin said. “Turns out\nadvanced ballistics and self-propelled rocketry proved a little beyond our\ngrasp. Curiously, with this power I can … see hints of what is to come. But\nthe mechanisms? Well, that takes experimentation, learning, iteration…”\nRust and Ruin. He couldn’t reach that ship. It was already too far out in\nthe ocean, far beyond what a Steelpush could manage. His anchor would\ngive out, and he’d drop into the depths.\n“… Mate?” Wayne said, worried. “Wax? What’s wrong?”\nCould he get to Elendel fast enough? He doubted he could outpace that\nship. And even if he could, what would he do when he arrived? The ship\nwould almost certainly detonate the bomb as soon as it drew enough of the\ncity into the blast radius.\n“Oh, give it up, Wax,” Telsin said, stepping closer. “Admit that I’m\nright. Did you know, that’s the most infuriating thing? When we were\nyoung I’d invite you to join me, but you’d judge me instead. You always\nthought you were too good for me.”\nHe turned, surprised at the vitriol in her voice.\n“I’ve hated you for decades,” she hissed at him, her eyes pulsing an\neven deeper red. “Because you could never just admit it. Well, today, I’m\ndoing what has to be done. You’re going to watch. You’re going to weep.\nAnd I’m going to Ascend.”\nHow?\nThere had to be a way!\n“A new world begins tonight,” Telsin said. “Emerging from Elendel’s\nsmoldering ruin. The Basin will be devoted to a new god, one who isn’t\nweak. Isn’t divided.\n“All day you’ve hounded me. But now you’re the one who is caught,\nand the ship is free. The bomb is on its way. You can’t stop it. Go ahead.\nThrow yourself into the night, Wax! You’ll end up swimming in the bay.\n“Or maybe you’ll hurry to Elendel, to join everyone who will die in the\nblast. The bomb is rigged to blow if the ship is stopped or struck by\nweapons fire. It’s too late. I’ve won. I—”\nHit her, Harmony, Wax thought. Cut her off. Now.\nTelsin gasped.

She stumbled, the red glow to her eyes fading, her lips\nparting, and fell motionless to the rooftop.\nHer body is pushed past its limits, Harmony told him. Waxillium … she’s\nbeing sustained only by the power. Get Autonomy to withdraw. Stop that\nship!\nWax met Wayne’s eyes, which were pleading with him, worried. The\nanswer. What was the answer?\nWax looked down through the broken skylight, where mist was pouring\nin like water into a drain.\nHe could barely make out a corpse below.\n67\nSteris stood at the central station, where people piled onto a train—a cargo\ntrain, as those could carry more people. She checked items off her list.\nAnother district evacuated.\nBroadsheets were getting wind of Steris’s efforts. Entire octants being\nevacuated? Mysterious gas leaks used as an explanation? People were\nfleeing by car in larger and larger numbers, but she’d planned for that. It\nwas part of the evacuation projections.\nShe nodded to TenSoon, who came prowling up, still wearing the\nconstable’s body. “Daal and the senators have fled the city. News that they\nare gone is spreading.”\n“That’s troubling,” Steris said. “But inconsequential before our current\nneed.”\nHis expression became distant. “Yes, but they took the Bands. I\nshouldn’t have brought them out, shouldn’t have let them go. I’ve been\naway from human politics for too long.” He looked at her. “I didn’t know,\nSteris. I didn’t know they had been drained. I feel we were played\nsomehow. I don’t do … human very well anymore.”\n“We will deal with the problem of the Bands,” she said, “if we have the\nluxury of surviving what is coming.”\nHe growled softly, but it seemed more like a sigh than a sign of\ndisagreement. They both turned as Governor Varlance walked up, wiping\nhis brow with his handkerchief. He’d begun the meetings today wearing\nwhite face makeup, but little of that remained, just some patches on his\ncheeks.\nHis presence lent a great deal of authority to Steris’s orders. People were\ncomforted to see him, the governor, directing efforts. Simply by standing\nnear her, he had probably saved thousands of lives.\nIt had proved difficult to keep him from talking and spoiling the effect\nby being … well, himself. “How are you doing?” she asked him, making a\nnotation as another train chugged away. “Perhaps some more coffee?”\n“No,” he said. “Thank you.” He paused and spoke more softly. “How\nmany do you think we can save?”\n“It depends entirely on how much time we have.”\n“Assume there’s not much,” he said, his voice growing even more\nhushed. “Lady Ladrian, we just received a report from intelligence\noperatives in Bilming. Something has happened.”\nShe felt a coldness deep inside. “Artillery launch?”\n“No,” he said. “Bilming has launched one of its warships toward\nElendel. Full speed.”\nA warship. She turned and waved toward Reddi, who was instructing his\nconstables to keep lines organized as people were loaded onto the next\ntrains."

She turned and waved toward Reddi, who was instructing his\nconstables to keep lines organized as people were loaded onto the next\ntrains.\nHe jogged over. “Bilming has launched a warship,” Steris said.\n“A single warship?” Reddi said. “We can handle that, even without a\nnavy of our own.”\n“Indeed,” the governor said.\nOnly one ship? Going at full speed?\nOh no.\nThe answer was obvious to her.\n“The ship is the bomb,” she said, her eyes wide. “Wax said he was going\nto try to interrupt the artillery launch. So they sent a ship instead, at full\nspeed, laden with explosives.”\n“Blessed Preservation,” Reddi whispered, then looked at the vast station\nstill full of people. They, including the ones already evacuated, represented\nonly a fraction of the city’s population. “Can we shell it?”\n“And detonate the bomb?” Steris asked. “They wouldn’t have chosen\nthis delivery mechanism if destroying the ship would stop the bomb.”\n“So Dawnshot has failed,” the governor said, slumping to the side\nagainst a pillar. “Elendel is lost.”\n“How long do we have?” Steris asked.\n“At full speed from Bilming?” Reddi said. “Not long. Hours at most.\nMost likely less than that.”\n“We can get away,” the governor said, “if we leave now. We have to get\non this train!”\nSteris stood there, numb. The other senators had already evacuated.\nThey would rant all day that she was wrong, but when there was a whiff of\nactual smoke, they broke down the doors to flee.\nBut she knew. She knew.\nShe slammed her hand against her notebook, surprised at her\nforcefulness, causing the panicking governor to hesitate.\n“That ship,” she said, “will not reach this city.”\n“How do you know?” the governor said.\n“Because my husband, Waxillium Ladrian, will prevent it.”\n“And if he doesn’t?” the governor said.\nSteris flipped through her notebook to the disaster scenarios she’d\nanticipated, landing on a specific page full of projections about the dangers\nof offshore earthquakes.\n“He will,” Steris promised. “But we need to evacuate the region nearest\nthe bay just in case. And prepare for the possibility of a tsunami.” She\nflipped to a map of the city, pointing. “We need these areas evacuated next\nin case the best my husband can do is detonate the weapon early.”\n“But … if Dawnshot fails…”\n“He will not fail,” Steris said. She took the governor by the arm. “I need\nyour help. Don’t go. Stay. Be a hero, Varlance.”\n“But…”\n“My husband will stop the ship.”\n“How do you know?” he asked. Nearby, one of the trains let out a jet of\nsteam, and last call was shouted. Governor Varlance took one step that way,\nbut then looked to her.\n“Some things,” she said softly, “cannot be planned for in life. I struggled\nto learn that, Varlance. But there is one thing I’ve learned that is true: No\nmatter what else happens, Waxillium Ladrian will get wherever he needs to\nbe. Somehow.”\n68"

Somehow.”\n68\nMarasi undid the final latch and heaved open the heavy metal hatch. Her\narm and leg still ached, but she’d overcome her immediate exhaustion.\nNo army had appeared. The soldiers in Wayfarer, with Entrone captured,\nhad backed down. Most everyone else—by the lord mayor’s orders—was\nconfined to quarters.\nEveryone was waiting to see what happened next.\n“We should have known,” Armal whispered from lower on the ladder.\n“This much metal, by their own admission, would have drawn their\n‘mutants.’ This hatch was never to lock them out, but to lock us in, so we\ncould never visit the observation room unsupervised.”\nMarasi climbed up into the observation chamber, which was indeed\ndifferent from the projection room she’d visited earlier in the day. This one\nwas a simple round room with one flat wall—the “window” that displayed a\ndestroyed city and falling ash. Apparently opening the hatch triggered the\nsystem.\nKnowing what she did, Marasi could see the flicker of the image as\nproof of its fake nature—but to someone who had never encountered\nanything like it, it would be astonishingly convincing. Somehow appearing\non the back wall without the projector streaming light through the room in a\nway that could be interrupted.\nMarasi helped Armal and the others up through the hatch. The four were\nimmediately transfixed by the image. In the next room they found the\nprojector—set up to shine onto the back of a sheet and create the image in\nthe main room.\nAs the four former captives inspected the equipment and put their hands\nbetween it and the sheet, Marasi found and opened another small door—one\nto the outside. It let the mists pour in, revealing that they were in a small,\nnondescript building in a warehouse district. The door looked out onto a\nstreet—and a good portion of the city was visible beyond, twinkling with\nelectric lights.\nArmal and the others gathered around her, staring. Marasi could only\nimagine their emotions. They’d believed her enough to fight Entrone and\nthe Set, but seeing this … knowing what had been stolen from them …\n“I’m sorry,” Marasi said. “I—”\n“Have you appreciated it?” Armal whispered.\nMarasi frowned as the woman regarded the city.\n“These seven years,” Armal said. “Have you used them? Have you\nappreciated them? I spent them wishing I could have even one more day of\nmy old life. That I could show my children a world of lights and life,\ninstead of stone and shadow. Please. Tell me you lived those years of\nfreedom.”\n“I…” Marasi said.\nHad she? She had spent much of that time with Allik, and that had been\nwonderful. And she’d accomplished much in her career. But was it what she\nwanted, ultimately?\nOr, was it all she wanted?\nShe’d seen and learned so much. And yet … these poor people, kept in\nthe shadows.

Marasi and\nthe Ghostbloods had been working toward the same goal for years, and she\nhad never known it.\nPeople suffered when the truth became a commodity to be speculated\nupon.\nFor now she looked up—peering through the mists, toward some\nspotlights shining high above. Was that … the top of the Shaw in the\ndistance? Lit up so it blazed in the mists like some kind of mythical\nbeacon?\nAs she watched, something flashed there, and the lights—in an\nexplosion—went out.\n69\nIt had taken Wellid far too long to decide he hated the ocean.\nHe had volunteered for this duty—sailing the Pewternaut A16 from\nBilming to Elendel—because he’d figured it would be the safest. On a giant\nship made of steel? The biggest the world had ever seen? Protected by the\nthick hull from enemy bullets?\nHe figured that at least—once the war started—he’d be aboard the most\nindestructible ship ever built. Yes, they were going to engage Elendel, but\nhe’d prefer that to being in Bilming where that crazy lawman swooped\naround.\nBut now here he was, the familiar glow of Bilming retreating in the dis-\ntance. Ordered to keep watch on the deck as they steamed across the\nchoppy waters. Keep watch for what? There was nothing out here but\nchurning froth and mist. They were even cutting lights on the ship, now that\nthey were out of the bay and beyond any other vessels they might hit.\nHe’d thought that sailing out on the ocean would be serene, but not\ntonight. The crash of waves, the thrum of engines. And other … phantom\nnoises from out there somewhere. Splashes that didn’t match the flow of the\nwater. Distant screeches that might have been gulls. Only what gull\nscreeched at night?\nSpooked by the sounds, he slid open the hood on his lantern.\nUnfortunately, that just lit up the mists—making a blazing halo around\nWellid. He couldn’t make out much of the waters; the ship’s deck was\npretty high up in the air. When he’d signed on, he hadn’t realized how\nintimidating it would be to look down. It was like he was atop a three-story\nbuilding, the water all the way below.\n“What are you doing?” a harsh voice said from behind. Gabria? The\nmore senior sailor took him by the arm and quickly closed the lantern’s\nhood. “Didn’t you hear the order? Once we’re out of the bay, we’re running\ndark. Do you want Elendel to be able to target us?”\n“I thought I heard something,” Wellid said, prying his arm free. “I’m on\nwatch. Aren’t I supposed to watch for things?”\n“If you hear something suspicious,” she said, “report it. Don’t open your\nlantern unless absolutely necessary. Didn’t you listen to the briefing?”\n“Sure I did,” he said. Though his mind did tend to wander.\n“Why are you wearing a life jacket?” she asked. “That wasn’t ordered.”\n“I want to be safe,” he said. “Hey, Gab? What are you going to do with"

What are you going to do with\nyour reward?”\nWith the lantern shielded, he couldn’t see her in the darkness. But she\nseemed to stare at him for an uncomfortably long time. Was he missing\nsomething?\n“Reward?” she said.\n“Sure,” he replied. “The great reward we were promised. For this\nmission?”\n“Wellid, what do you think we’re doing?”\n“Delivering a payload,” he said. “To Elendel. It’s a weapon, right? We\ndrop it off, then we get out of there?”\nAnother uncomfortable pause. “Yes,” she said. “Get out of there. That’s\nright. But I’m not doing it for the reward.”\nHe should have expected that. The others, well, they were all a little bit\nmore … diligent about all of this. Trell. The impending war with Elendel.\nThey’d have probably volunteered for this mission even if it hadn’t been\naboard a giant indestructible warship.\n“Keep that lantern shielded,” Gabria said, “and fetch me if you hear or\nsee something suspicious. Credibly suspicious.”\nShe stalked off across the deck, leaving him alone with the cold mists\nand indifferent waters. He was supposed to patrol, but they hadn’t given\nhim a specific route. So after listening to those waves, and feeling like he\ncould hear the darkness watching him, he walked in the direction Gabria\nhad gone. Logically he’d need to stick close to—\nWhat was that?\nThat thump against the hull surely hadn’t just been his imagination. He\nwas near the back of the ship—um, the aft of the ship, sir—and the sound\nhad come from farther along. He inched forward, wielding his lantern in a\nshaking hand. Even shielded, it let out a tiny bit of light. Letting him better\nmake out the ship’s back railing.\nThat noise was nothing, he told himself forcibly. You heard things in the\nmists. Everyone knew that. He shouldn’t say anything, because Gabria had\n—\nA hand reached up from the darkness below and seized the top bar of the\nrailing. A shape followed, pitch black, vaguely human, heaving itself onto\nthe deck. It had tentacles waving behind it, a hundred of them curling like\nthe mists. In that shadow, Wellid saw a misbegotten shape. A thing that\nwasn’t human, a thing that couldn’t be human. The mists seemed to know\nthis, for while they played with the waving tentacles, they stayed away from\nthe figure. It repelled the mist.\nIt was a mistwraith, Wellid knew. A terror from the deep, a relic of\nancient times. A thing of stories and legend come to claim his soul.\nHe found his voice and screamed. With fumbling fingers, he threw open\nthe shield on the lantern, bathing the deck in light. Revealing …\nA man. Tall, with prominent sideburns, his vest and cravat peeking from\nunderneath a thick duster—mistcoat tassels spraying out behind him in the\nwind.\nDawnshot was here. On the ship."

Even before\nWax’s arrival, she’d been worried. Autonomy’s deadline was today. Maybe\nshe could have gotten more time—made the rocket work—except … except\nfor him.\nShe growled softly and rolled over to find one of the engineers shaking\nher arm. What had happened? Her Investment from Autonomy should have\nprevented a blackout like that. She felt … wrung out. Her core cold, her\narms sore from scraping the rooftop, her skin clammy. Rusts. She felt\npractically mortal again.\nWhat is happening? she asked Autonomy.\nYou, the distant—too distant—voice said, are failing me.\nNo. The bomb is being delivered! I’m … I’m …\nFor the first time, she took in the wreckage around her. A broken\nrooftop. Bent steel girders. A smashed remnant of her missile-launching\nconstruction.\n“What … what happened?” she hissed.\n“They took spikes from the bodies,” the woman said, pointing.\n“Ordinary ones, not made of your metal. But one granted … duralumin.”\nNo.\nTelsin heaved herself to her feet and stumbled to the edge of the\nbuilding to stare out over the bay. The force of Wax’s Push had bent and\ncrushed the very underlying girders of the skyscraper here, leaving the\nrooftop cracked and sloped.\nYour failure begins, Autonomy said, voice increasingly distant. You are\nnot worthy.\nThe fire inside Telsin died. The power that had for so many months\nwarmed her was leeching away. Her skin began to turn grey.\nNo! she thought. No! The bomb cannot be stopped.

He\nexpected to get an earful for making Wayne climb the rest of the way.\nA sailor reached for her gun, and Wax for his own. But before either of\nthem could draw, Wayne flung a handful of bullets into the air and Pushed\nthem to streak through the air, dropping the woman.\n“Ruuusts,” Wayne said. “Is that what it’s always been like for you? That\nwas so easy!” Wayne eyed him. “Gotta be honest, almost ruins your\nreputation, mate. If people knew how easy bein’ a Coinshot was, they’d all\nstop talkin’ about how great you are.”\nWax shook his head, pointing Vindication at the second sailor—the\ntrembling one holding up the lantern. Wayne had of course insisted on a\nspike for himself. Ruin. Wax hoped what they’d done hadn’t been too\nblasphemous.\nNo, Harmony’s voice said in his head, not blasphemous, Waxillium.\nMore … a sense of industrious recycling.\n“Good to know,” Wax muttered.\nI cannot see where the bomb is, Harmony told him. I can see only what\nyou do. I didn’t know the ship was the delivery mechanism—but I am afraid\nthe device will have redundancies and dead man’s switches. Take care. We\ncannot afford to detonate it by accident. I fear that even at this range, it\nwould be deadly to many innocent people.\nStrange. He’d come all the way around to finding God’s voice in his\nhead comforting again.\nWayne seized the fellow with the lantern by the arm, holding tight and\nstaring him in the eyes—though the man didn’t seem to need any further\nintimidation.\n“The bomb,” Wax said. “Where is it?”\n“The … the payload?” the man stuttered, then pointed to a nearby door.\n“In the munitions hold. A-all the way down. Follow the red lines painted\non … on the walls.”\nWax shared a glance with Wayne, then nodded.\n“You can’t go inside!” the man said. “The weapon is fragile and might\nexplode, so only the experts are allowed to touch it! You’ll blow up the\nentire ship!”\n“Then mate,” Wayne said with a drawl, “I suggest you find a way to not\nbe on the ship anymore. Real fast.”\nWayne let go. The nervous fellow glanced from Wax to Wayne, then—\nwith a sense of panic—threw himself off the ship into the churning waters\nbelow, taking his lantern with him and leaving the two of them in darkness.\n“Damn,” Wayne said. “I meant for him to find a lifeboat or somethin’.”\n“The people on this ship are going to be zealots,” Wax said.\n“Considering they’re on a suicide mission.” Shouts from farther along the\ndeck, including other lanterns being unshuttered, indicated that someone\nhad noticed what was happening.\nWith increasing urgency, Wax led the way to the metal door the man had\nindicated.

There was another device on the\nfar wall, also rigged with wires—these leading to the three barrels. There\nwere no obvious timers, control panels, or anything of the sort. It was,\nfrankly, baffling.\n“Careful, mate,” Wayne said as he inspected the contraption. “Be real\ncareful.”\n“It’s some kind of dead man’s rig,” Wax said. “These three barrels are\nthe explosive devices, each with its own power source. Disarm one, and it\nwill send a signal to detonate the other two via that contraption on the wall.\nWayne, tell me you still have those schematics.”\n“Course I do,” Wayne said, digging in his pocket. “Got lots of\ninteresting stuff in here.” He pulled out the schematics Wax had given him,\nthen spread them out on the floor.\nYou are right, Harmony said in Wax’s head, processing the information\nfar faster than he could. Actually, it’s worse than you think. The control\ndevice is sending a pulse every twenty seconds to the three barrels, telling\nthem not to detonate. If that stops, they’ll go off.\nThat is combined with a dead man’s rig. If something happens to one of\nthe bombs, the other two will detonate. Even if we had three people, one\ndisarming each barrel at the same time, it wouldn’t work. The timing is too\nprecise for humans. You’d end up detonating two of the bombs.\n“How much destructive power are we talking about?” Wax asked,\nfolding out the bomb schematics. “What if we set a charge, get out of here,\nand let it blow in the middle of the ocean?”\nWaxillium, Wayne … Harmony said, and Wayne perked up, apparently"

        "text": "and let it blow in the middle of the ocean?”\nWaxillium, Wayne … Harmony said, and Wayne perked up, apparently\nhearing the conversation too. This is a new kind of explosive—the direct\ntransformation of matter into energy. I don’t think Autonomy or her agents\nunderstand how destructive this is. Looking at this, and how much metal\nthey’ve used, I suspect they severely underestimated this bomb’s power.\nIf we were simply talking about harmonium blowing up when combined\nwith water, then yes: you could detonate it safely out here in the ocean. But\na blast caused by splitting harmonium with trellium … My friends, I have\nno idea how much power that would release. I can’t exactly be sure what\nwill happen if something this powerful is ignited. It could set the very\natmosphere ablaze.\nIf not, it would potentially vaporize not just Elendel and Bilming, but\nmany cities nearby as well. Your sister is desperate, and Autonomy is\ncallous. I doubt they tested anything on this size or scale in those caverns.\nWe can’t let this explode. But … I also can’t see a way to disarm it.\nWayne whistled softly. Wax carefully backed away, not touching any of\nthe wires. The only safe thing to do would be to get this ship—and\neverything it contained—as far from civilization as possible.\n“So,” Wayne said, “guess we get to steal a ship, eh? That’s new.”\n70\nSteris didn’t have nearly enough time.\nBut she had learned, from both accounting and contracts, never to be\noverwhelmed by scale. Dealing with sums of money in the millions didn’t\nmake a thousand boxings less valuable. In a similar way, being unable to\ncompletely evacuate the city—or even a region of it—didn’t lessen the\nvalue of a single life.\nSo she left Constable-General Reddi to handle the main evacuation and\nhurried with the governor to the city docks. Her master plan included these\npeople leaving via boat, which meant tons of people now crowded the\ndocks. If that bomb exploded nearby, all of these would be in serious\ndanger. In addition, she worried about flooding. She knew only a little\nregarding this possibility from the studies she’d read—but that was enough\nto make her alarmed.\nShe had to rectify this miscalculation. Get as many people away from\nthis region as she could. The governor took command of the dockworkers\nvia their foremen. Following her instructions, he sent them to begin\nwrangling people for a retreat farther into the city.\nSteris set her notebooks out by a lantern on a workman’s desk, sitting\nbeneath the dark night sky, on the road above the bay, worried about her\nlow resources in this region.\n“Steris Ladrian?” a voice said from behind her.\nShe turned to find a group of eight men and women in nondescript\nclothing. “We were told,” said the man at their lead, “you could use our\nhelp.”\n“Did the governor recruit you?” she asked.\n“Actually—”\nHe was interrupted as Governor Varlance came jogging up, followed by\nseveral workers.\n“You,” Steris said, ripping out a page and thrusting it toward one of the\nmen. “Train conductor? I need all of these people gathering here inside"

I need those cargo bins moved into positions blocking the streets\nhere, arranged to stem and slow a flood of water, in case of a tsunami.\n“Construction workers, congratulations. You’re now constables. Wear\nyour brightest hats and vests and get the people from these three sections\nmoving inland away from the docks. I’ve outlined a route for you. You\nwon’t get far, but putting buildings between you and the ocean is essential.\n“Dockworkers, I need ropes. As many as you can find. We’re going to\nmake stable anchor points where we can start human chains to grab anyone\nwho might be swept away if there’s a flood. Hurry! Our primary concern is\na blast out in the bay. Our secondary concern is flooding.”\nThe majority of the foremen ran off through the mists, calling for their\ncrews. It was rather fulfilling how alacritously they obeyed. She wasn’t\naccustomed to people simply doing what she said; in the past they’d always\nneeded a great deal of persuasion.\n“I’ve noted the structures I believe are strong enough to withstand a\nblast or flood,” Steris said to the governor. “We should evacuate people in\nthis region to the middle floors, congregated away from windows.”\n“This…” the governor said, looking over the plans. “This is incredible!\nWhy haven’t you shared any of this?”\n“It’s mostly done for my own amusement,” Steris admitted. “Or my own\nanxiety.”\n“What a waste,” he said, picking up one of the sheets. “I thought your\nevacuation plan was exhaustive, but this is even more so. It’s brilliant. You\nhave detailed plans like this for other disasters?”\n“Only fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, sudden invasions, dust storms,\ndroughts, food shortages, and mass pipe breakings. There are seven more I\nwant to get to.”\nHe stared at her, his eyes wide, several of the remaining officials\ngathering around and nodding as they looked over her maps, instructions,\nand plans. “Your talents,” the governor whispered, “have previously been\nwasted, Lady Ladrian.”\nWhat … What was this emotion?\nFeeling appreciated? She’d felt appreciated before by Wax, yes, and\noccasionally Marasi. But to see it in the eyes of virtual strangers, to have\nher overplanning seen as a talent, not a bizarre character flaw …\nBy the Survivor. This warmth inside. She’d always said she didn’t care\nwhat people thought of her. And she’d worked hard to build that bubble\naround herself, a protection against the way she was normally treated.\nBut this … this was a remarkable feeling. Was this what it felt like to be\nproud of who you were? Instead of worried you were embarrassing those\naround you?\nMiraculous.\n“What is next?” the governor asked. “What else can we do?”\n“I want to sink those ships,” Steris said, pointing to the large cargo\nvessels out in the bay that were waiting to be called in to receive\npassengers. “After bringing their sailors in safely first, of course.”"

You\nread what happened to the island of Alicago three years ago? No? Well,\nanyway, think of speed bumps. Large cargo ships on the surface will glide\nover the water, or worse be carried with it and slammed into people on the\ndocks. Scuttled on the bay’s floor though, they’ll create drag and slow the\nforce of the wave if one comes.”\nAgain, instead of objecting or complaining, the foremen simply\naccepted her explanation—and her orders. Only one seemed concerned. He\nhesitated as the others began to move off.\n“What is it?” Steris asked.\n“His Honor the governor,” the man said, “told us there wasn’t much\ntime left. To get those ships sunk might take hours, ladyship. We’ll have to\ntake tugs out to them—not many of the cargo ships have radio yet—and\nthen explain to the captains, probably fight them on it. Then the scuttling\nprocess … it’s not as easy as it sounds. I’d guess four, five hours to get this\nlot sunk. At least.”\nRusts. Well, that wouldn’t work.\nSomeone cleared their throat behind her. One of the eight people who\nhad approached her first. Oh, right—she still didn’t know who had sent\nthem, or even who they were.\n“Perhaps we can help,” the man in the lead said. “You are certain this is\nlegal? The mass sinking of private ships?”\n“Yes,” the governor said. “On my authority. If we are so fortunate as to\nhave overreacted, the city will pay for the losses incurred by the ship\ncaptains.”\n“Ohhh…” Steris said, leaning toward him. “Varlance, that sounded\npositively heroic.”\n“Really?” he asked, eager. “Heroic?”\n“Decisive,” she said. “Very leaderlike.”\nNearby, the leader of the eight people nodded to her, then launched into\nthe air.\nOh! Allomancers. She had all the official ones working on the main\nevacuation. But having these to sink ships would certainly help. And then\nshe could use them to help carry the injured or infirm away with\nSteelpushes.\nThe others followed one at a time, until only one remained. He nodded\nto Steris, and on the back of his hand—mostly obscured—she saw a red\ntattoo.\n“Your sister,” the man said, “sends her regards.” Then he launched after\nthe others.\nThat was the last of the meaningful actions Steris could take. From here,\nshe could only make certain her plans were being executed. Everything else\nrested on Waxillium. None of this would matter if that bomb reached the\ncity.\nYou’d better be on that ship, Wax, she thought.\n71\nClearing the ship proved to be an ordeal.

Yeah, he’d learned the value of hard work—it\nturned out to be three clips. Least, that was what Jeffy had charged to do the\njob for Wayne.\nThis time, there was nobody else to do the job. After locking the door to\nthe room with the bomb, they set out to take control of the ship. Wayne kept\nthe key in his pocket, in case Wax had to face another Coinshot.\nThey didn’t meet any. The ship had only a skeleton crew; seemed they’d\nsaved most of their troops to protect the Shaw. It took some time to fight\ntheir way to the bridge regardless, given the need to check every corner and\nflush out people trying to ambush them. Wayne thought every crew member\non board had been mustered to try to stop them.\nWhen, half an hour or more later, Wax finally Pushed down the\nreinforced door to the bridge, they found a disturbing sight. Four people—\nthree women and a fellow—dead on the floor from self-inflicted gunshots.\nAll wore officers’ uniforms. They’d killed themselves rather than fall into\ncustody.\n“You know,” Wayne said, shouldering his rifle, “I thought the weird\nones would all be in the Roughs, you know? City folk, they were supposed\nto be educated. And … and refined. And not bleedin’ zealots.”\nWax checked the bodies to be sure, then stepped up to the ship’s front\ncontrols. They were a confusing mess of levers, along with a giant ship’s\nwheel that appeared to have been locked in place. The ship was still moving\nat full speed through the mists, and rusts. Wayne thought he could see the\nglow of Elendel on the horizon. They were getting close.\nWax stopped at the controls, then cursed softly.\n“What?” Wayne said.\n“It’s wired to the same system,” Wax said. “Harmony? Can you\nconfirm?”\nYes, unfortunately, the god said. With you to give me sight, I can see that\nit’s wired into the bomb.\n“If we undo the locks on the controls, it blows,” Wax said. “I should\nhave foreseen this. We wasted time coming up here.”\n“But—” Wayne said.\n“It makes a brutal sense,” Wax said. “They guided the ship here, then\nlocked the course down before killing themselves. The thing will explode\nthe moment it stops—as soon as it hits land. We’re not on a traditional ship.\nThis is a rocket, like the one they built to fly to Elendel. Self-propelled.\nNeeding no controls. Set to detonate the second it hits.”\n“Mate,” Wayne said, pointing out the front windows. “I see lights.”\nYou have approximately twenty minutes, Harmony said softly, at current\nspeed.\n“We have to risk trying to defuse the bomb,” Wax said, rushing out onto\nthe deck.\nWayne scrambled to follow, tripping on bodies. “Wait! You said that if\nwe tried, we’d almost certainly blow the thing!”\n“Do you have a better idea?”\n“Maybe,” Wayne said, halting beside the railing—mists coursing past\nlike a river in the sky."

He looked out at the ocean and realized\nsomething. This ship here … well, this was a lot like a lone mesa. It fit way\nbetter than the Shaw had. Yes, a solitary mesa in the middle of flat lands …\nAnd it needed to gobble up the hero.\n“You said that this bomb,” Wayne said, “it blows up big if detonated\nproper. But one part of it is ettmetal, right?”\n“Harmonium,” Wax said. “Yes. And?”\n“And that stuff is so unstable, it blows up if water touches it. Except in a\nsmaller explosion? One that won’t level cities and such?”\n“It’s still bad,” Wax said. “But not catastrophic. But if we fiddle with\none of the devices by pouring water into it to detonate the ettmetal, the\nothers will simply go off.”\n“Unless,” Wayne said, “we were using a speed bubble. See, there’s that\ndevice on the wall, right? And if we fiddle with one of the bombs, it’s going\nto detonate the other ones?”\n“Right,” Wax said.\n“So, what if we put up a speed bubble that leaves out the device on the\nwall? We could work on one of the barrels, detonating the harmonium in it\nso the real explosion can’t happen. We set that explosion off, then kick that\nbarrel out of the speed bubble. It’ll send a warning to the other two barrels,\nbut that signal will have to pass along the wires outside the speed bubble, to\nreach the box on the wall. So the signal will be frozen in time and can’t\ncome back! We could work on the other barrels during that time.”\n“Wayne,” he said, “do you have any idea how quickly electricity\nmoves? Even assuming you could do something incredible—like speed up\ntime by a factor of a thousand—that wouldn’t be nearly fast enough to\noutrun an electrical signal.”\nOh.\nWait, Harmony said to them. This could work. I have a way. Wax, I gave\nyou a vial with a red cork.\n“I have it,” Wax said, fishing in his sheath of metal vials. He frowned,\nand came out with … a handkerchief.\n“Barely used,” Wayne said.\n“Wayne…”\nWayne grinned and handed Wax his rifle, then fished in his pocket. “I\nthought it needed to be somewhere safe. So I made a nice little trade.”\n“Harmony,” Wax said, “if you can make this work, it will still detonate\nthe ship, right?”\nYes.\n“Wayne,” Wax said, “… setting off the smaller explosions would kill\neveryone in that room. An ettmetal blast like that isn’t something you\nsurvive, even if you had full metalminds.”\n“Ah,” Wayne said as the ship hit a wave, water spraying up along the\nside. “I’d figured out that part. I just needed to know if the idea worked.\nAnd I needed to confirm one other thing.”\n“Which is?” Wax said."

Wayne felt real proud of that Push. He did it like\nWax did, crouching down first to give it a little lift.\nHis friend gave him a look of outrage … and maybe regret … as he\nvanished into the misty darkness over the waters.\n“Land safely, mate,” Wayne whispered. “And survive.”\nHe tipped his hat, then pulled out the red-corked vial. “What the hell is\nthis, anyway?”\nEarlier in the week, you all conducted a test, Harmony said. Splitting\nharmonium.\n“Same test our enemies have done a hunnerd or more times.”\nYes, but this one was different. I have no idea what happened, but Wax\ndid something different from everyone else trying this. Because he didn’t\nmerely blow up the room. He created something. Something amazing.\nWayne held up the vial, staring at the metal dust settled at the bottom.\nThat, Harmony said, is the faintest bit of lerasium, Wayne. A metal from\nlegend. A metal found by Vin at the Well of Ascension, and used to make\nElend Venture a Mistborn. A metal that hasn’t existed for centuries, and as\nfar as I know, hasn’t been made in millennia. Drink that vial and you’ll be a\nMistborn, able to use all of the metals. There’s a little of each one in there.\n“Why didn’t you have Wax drink it earlier?”\nI don’t want to reveal this happened, as I don’t know why or how. I don’t\nknow what he did. Besides … he might have already had a dose, inhaled\nduring the explosion.\nHuh. That explained a few things.\nWayne knocked back the vial. Then he waited. Nothing happened.\n“That’s anticlimactic,” he muttered.\nYou have to burn the lerasium, Wayne.\nOh, right. He searched, and found a new metal reserve. Neat. He\nreached out and burned it.\nA flash of light.\nA fire in his veins.\nA feeling like a kick to the face.\nDamn.\n“How does this help?” he asked.\nYou can now burn duralumin.\n“That fancy metal that not-Wax was using to make those big\nSteelpushing explosions?”\nExactly.\n“I don’t need to Push though.”\nWayne, using duralumin burns all the metals in you at once. Every\nsingle bit. The more you have, the more powerful it is. It doesn’t just work\non steel. It works on any Allomantic metal.\nWayne paused, the ship rocking, then whistled softly, understanding.\n“You mean…”\nHow much bendalloy do you have left?\nHe fished a pouch out of his pocket.\nHmm. Maybe enough to—\nWayne fished another pouch out of his other pocket.\nOkay, and—\nAnd the pouch in his sock. Uncomfortable, but handy.\nWayne, how many pouches do you have?"

I think it will.\nWayne turned and took the steps down at extra-fast speed—grabbing a\ncanteen off one of the corpses. He swallowed mouthfuls of metal beads on\nhis way, stuffing himself with bendalloy. Echoing noises warned him about\nsailors trying to break into the room to detonate the bomb, but they didn’t\nhave a key. He dealt with both men, then burst back into the room. Electric\nlights flickered on the walls, and he could hear the chugging of the engines\nsomewhere farther inside the ship.\n… And suddenly he wasn’t alone. A figure—mostly transparent—stood\nbeside him, a tall bald man. Terris. And another darker fellow stood behind\nhim. Not in the skin tone sense or anything. Like … this other one was a\nshadow. It mimicked Harmony as he held out his hands to Wayne.\n“I knew,” Harmony said softly, “that I had to bring Wax to Elendel. It is\npossible to see future needs. I understood it would be good to make this\nchoice, though one doesn’t always know why. Even if one is a god.” He\nhesitated. “I thought I only needed Wax. It seems that I was wrong.”\nWayne tossed up a speed bubble, so that time didn’t move so quickly.\nHe needed a moment to compose himself.\n“It should be Wax,” Wayne said. “He’s the one that fixes messes like\nthis.”\n“No,” Harmony said. “You have practiced all your life with speed\nbubbles, Wayne. Wax would be brand new at them. You might be the only\nperson in the world who could do this.”\n“That’s kind of depressing,” Wayne said, turning to Harmony. “Really,\nI’m the best you could do? Ain’t you God?”\nHarmony’s eyes softened. “Wayne. You aren’t the best I could do.\nYou’re the best there is. And no being, neither god nor mortal, could have\nwished for more than one such as you.”\nWayne wanted to reject that. But damn, if God was sayin’ it …\nmaybe … maybe Wax was right? About Wayne?\nDamn. Had Wax been right all along?\n“You don’t have to do this,” Harmony whispered. “I will never again\nforce such a choice upon someone. Unfortunately, it is the only sure\nsolution that I can think of, and my thoughts move with exceptional speed.\nThis preserves, but it … destroys.”\n“The only solution that is sure,” Wayne said. “There’s another?”\n“It is possible—very slightly possible—that you could use your new\npowers to Push hard enough against upcoming sources of metal to hold the\nship back, treading water, while we gain more time and figure something\nelse out. It would be exceptionally difficult, but it’s plausible.”\n“You can see the future,” Wayne said. “Would it work?”\n“I can see probabilities,” Harmony said. “I can see what might happen.\nIt is, at times, frustrating.”\n“And … what are the chances that other option works?”"

You have to\nhear it from me too, I think. You can’t do this for forgiveness. You need no\nforgiveness, not anymore.”\nAnd … he was right.\nWayne wasn’t doing this for forgiveness, or out of shame, or out of a\nneed to prove himself. He wasn’t the man he’d been when Wax pulled him\nout of his hiding place. He was someone different.\n“Wayne,” Harmony asked, “do you know who you are?”\n“Yeah, I know who I am,” Wayne said. “I’m the God. Damn. HERO.”\nHe paused. “Sorry.”\n“Under the circumstances,” Harmony said, smiling, “I understand. Each\nof those barrels has a hole in the top, to draw in air once the explosion\nstarts. The harmonium has been removed from its oil bath and is currently\nbeing heated. That means if you pour water in, it will detonate the\nharmonium. That will destroy the mechanism that heats up the bomb, and\nwill prevent the much greater explosion. Once you pour, use your\nAllomancy to Push the barrel out of the speed bubble.”\n“Right, then,” Wayne said. “I’m gonna need your hat.”\n“My … hat?”\n“Gotta sculpt a speed bubble just right,” Wayne said, “and put\neverything I have into the Push. Burn so much bendalloy in one moment, it\npractically melts me from the inside—slow time so much, even electric\nsignals get dull.”\n“I don’t wear a hat.”\n“You’re God. Improvise somethin’.”\nHarmony paused, then touched Wayne on the head. He felt it start to\nglow, as if something had been settled there. Earrings too. He felt earrings\nlike a proper Terrisman wore. Something he’d maybe always been, just in\nsecret.\nIt wasn’t nothin’ magical. But when he wore someone’s hat, he thought\nhe could understand them.

But it\nwas the same. What Wayne did, it was Pushing on reality itself. Distorting\nit, shoving it inward, warping it.\nToday he Pushed harder than any person in history. He Pushed like a\ngod, on account of wearing Sazed’s own hat. On account of that strange\nmetal, and on account of Wayne bein’ the hero.

He ducked back as the\nwater dripped, then Pushed that barrel right out of the speed bubble as the\nexplosion started. It transfixed him momentarily, fire and light erupting\nfrom the barrel, all outlined in these strange blue lines. As if that barrel was\nreleasing its soul to the afterlife.\nCracks started to appear in his crystallized speed bubble. Damn. Wayne\nleaped to the second barrel and poured, then Pushed it out too. It sent\nelectric warnings up the wires—but the box that controlled the detonation\nwas stuck in slow time, the signals moving like molasses.\nDamn, how fast was he moving? And he’d thought he was getting slow\nbecause of old age. Heh."

Heh.\nHe slammed into the third barrel and dumped the rest of the canteen’s\nwater out into it. He Pushed it, then turned, gazing out at all three barrels\nhanging motionless in time. He was going so fast, only the first one was\nexploding, and that because he’d taken the longest to Push it out. The blast\nwas completely halted now.\nHe let out a breath and dropped the canteen. He’d been gobbled up, it\nwas true. But when that happened, you strangled the monster from the\ninside.\nHis crystalline speed bubble shattered.\nAnd all became red light and blossoms of fire.\n72\nWax struggled in the dark waters.\nThen something erupted to his right. A flash of light, blinding and\ndazzling. Followed by a shock wave in the air, and another in the water. For\nboth, he thought he glimpsed—briefly, through the omnipresent light—the\nsight of a figure dulling the wave directly in front of him. A calm Terrisman\nstanding tall on the surface of the water, with one hand stretched forward.\nThen, darkness again. Wax blinked, his eyes blinded by the blast. Debris\nrained around him. Splashing into the choppy waves.\nIn moments, Wax was struggling to stay afloat. He’d hit the water hard,\nand thought he’d broken at least one leg. Wayne, trying to save his life?\nThat frustrating, infuriating …\n… that wonderful man.\n“Farewell, my friend,” Wax whispered, choking on his emotion. “You\nincredible rusting man. Thank you.”\nAs the waters grew more choppy, Wax had to struggle harder. He forced\nthrough pain, grief, and fatigue to keep himself—barely—afloat. He burned\nhis steel, then … something else. Something deep within, which kept him\nwarm.\nDespite that, he was lost in darkness, and even the mists kept their\ndistance. With his leg not working, with his coat dragging him down, with\nthe exhaustion of a nation’s hopes weighing on him, he felt himself begin to\nslip. Begin to lose his fight with the waters. Begin to …\nWhat was that?\nA tiny light, drifting closer. Small, yet unyielding in the mists. It\nresolved into … a lantern? On a small boat? How …\nThe boat motored right up to him, and then a man in a coachman’s outfit\nwith white gloves stood up on the deck and reached out to Wax.\n“Carriage,” Hoid said, “for you. Sir.”\n73\nThe shock wave hit Steris like a thunderclap. She gasped in surprise, her\nears ringing from the sound of the detonation. Rusts.\nShe and the governor had been carried via Allomancer far into the center\nof the city—close to their original evacuation command post—following\ntheir efforts at the docks.

And the buildings nearest the explosion …\nFortunately, the only ill effects she felt—standing atop a building this far\nfrom the blast—was that shock wave. And so, after her initial panic, she\nwatched that brilliant light in the distance slowly fade.\nA moment ago, that explosion had been like a momentary sun on the\nhorizon, magnificent and ominous all at once, blazing through the mists.\nNow, in seconds, all that remained were the afterimage and the faint ringing\nin her ears.\nThe governor peeked up over the rooftop’s stone railing, where he’d\nducked at the initial explosion. Then he stood up straight. “He’s done it,\nhasn’t he? Preservation! He’s done it! He detonated the bomb early! The\ncity is saved!”\nSteris nodded, exhaling a long breath. Wax had been exactly where\nshe’d hoped he would be. Now that she’d seen that light—then survived the\ndetonation—a new worry struck her.\nYou’d better not have been on that ship when the explosion happened,\nWaxillium Ladrian, she thought. You … just … just have gotten off, all\nright?\n“Will the tsunami come?” the governor said.\n“Yes,” Steris said. “Imminently.”\n“We … uh…” The governor straightened his cravat. “We actually\nhelped, didn’t we?”\n“Yes,” she said. “The dockside buildings are going to be a disaster zone\nin the weeks to come—we’ll need to rebuild. But I think we evacuated most\npeople from the dangerous section.”\nWater was pulling back rapidly from the docks as she watched.\nReceding in advance of a tsunami. Hopefully it would not be a big one. The\nstudies she’d read were inconclusive about how water would react to\nexplosions.\n“Thank the Survivor,” the governor said. “I’m … glad you let us retreat.\nI worried you’d insist on staying by the docks.”\n“There is no need to go down with the city,” Steris said, “if the city isn’t\ngoing down.”\nHe nodded eagerly. He was actually quite an agreeable man. Which\nmade sense. He’d been chosen by people who wanted to steer him. People\nwho’d never expected him to put his hands on the helm and take control.\nShe blinked, her eyes bearing the afterimage of that explosion.\nJust … be safe … Steris thought toward that distant, now faded, point of\nlight. Please.\n74\nWayne floated.\nFloated someplace high. Damn. Was that the planet itself beneath him?\nIt was a sphere, as everyone said. He’d always hoped maybe it would be,\nlike, doughnut shaped or something. To throw the smart folks for a loop.\nFelt kinda strange to be all the way up here, in the darkness. He leaned\nforward and felt a disorientation, like he should be falling. He was woozy,\nunsteady.\nHuh. Who’d have thought being dead would be so much like being\ndrunk? He could write a whole damn book of scripture about that, he could.\nA figure hovered next to him. Vast. His robes like the infinite colors of\ncreation, his essence seeming to expand into the darkness of space itself."

His robes like the infinite colors of\ncreation, his essence seeming to expand into the darkness of space itself.\nBut at his core, he had the appearance of a bald, kindly Terrisman.\n“Hey, God,” Wayne said. “How’s … um … creation? Time and space?\nReality? You know, things?”\n“Good,” Harmony replied. “Because of you.”\n“Now wait,” Wayne said. “I ain’t gonna be a ghost, am I?”\n“No. You were Invested when you died, so you will persist a short time,\nbut will soon join the Beyond.”\n“Good, good.”\n“You don’t find that idea concerning?”\n“Hell no,” Wayne said. “I already done gone and died. That was the part\nthat I worried would hurt.” He gaped down at the planet below. “It’s so\nbig.”\n“Yes, Wayne,” Harmony said. “I realize that a person might become\nintimidated, seeing all this. Recognizing the vastness of what they’ve lived\nupon. It is a lot to take in, I think. It can make a person feel small,\ninsignificant, and—”\nWayne grinned. “And I saved the whole damn thing!”\nHarmony paused. “Well, I suppose you did. With some help from\nMarasi and Waxillium.” Harmony gestured toward a red haze, swirling\naway from the planet as if in a funnel, vanishing into the distance.\nWayne felt something from it. An angry sort of respect. Begrudging. Her\navatar had been defeated, and so Autonomy withdrew her touch from the\nplanet.\n“Is that it, then?” Wayne asked.\n“For now,” Harmony said. “She was overextending to try to bring us\ndown quickly, I think. Telsin and the Set’s failure is an enormous setback,\nand Marasi was quick to collapse the portal to this planet. My vision\nreturns, and I will try to take care I am not blindsided again.”\n“You sound afraid?” Wayne said, cocking his head.\n“Nervous,” Harmony said, his expression distant. “I can see pieces\nmoving in the cosmere. Aligning. Pointed at us. We are not free of their\ninfluence. But we have … time, now. Time to prepare. Thanks to you,\nWayne.”\n“Me,” Wayne said. “I saved the whole damn world. I … I’m probably\nthe best constable who ever rusting lived!”\n“I … suppose…” Harmony said, “that Vin, Elend, and the others\nweren’t constables…”\n“Wax ain’t never saved the whole world. And most of the others in the\noctant constabulary? They couldn’t save a coupon for free beer, even when\nI gave it to them. Stupid kandra giraffe man. Wayne, the best conner in the\nwhole damn world … Ha! Eat that, Reddi. Eat it with hot sauce and cry!”\nWayne felt something happening as he said it, though. A kind of …\nstretching feeling. Like he was being pulled somewhere. Somewhere …\nwarm?\n“Before you go,” Harmony said, “is there anything you would like to\nknow?

Any question? That was a hard one. He pondered a moment. “So,”\nhe said, “before she left, MeLaan told me that I was the best lay she ever\nhad, and I was wondering—”\n“Wayne,” God interrupted, “what is it Ranette always says to you?”\n“Try dodging this?”\n“The other thing.”\n“Don’t ruin the moment by bein’ all skeevy?”\n“Yes, that one.”\n“Right, right,” Wayne said, nodding. “Good point. Good point. You’re\nsmart, maybe even as smart as Ranette. Suppose that makes sense and all.”\nHe continued to think, though that stretching sensation … it was getting\nstronger. What could he ask? What …\nThen he grinned. That was perfect.\n“I’m gonna assume Wax and them will be fine,” Wayne said. “You\nalready promised that. So I ain’t going to waste a question on them. And\nyou can’t trick me into doing so. You’ll take care of them. I know you will.”\n“To the best of my ability,” Harmony said.\n“Good. Then tell me this, God,” Wayne said, pointing at him. “Was that\nthe biggest damn explosion a person ever made?”\nHarmony raised an eyebrow. “That’s your last question? Your final\nrequest of God before you pass into eternity?”\n“Hell yes! Figure now that I’m dead, I’ll get the other answers right\nsoon. You ain’t going to trick me into asking a useless question. So tell me.\nWas it?”\nHarmony smiled. “Ah, Wayne. I suppose that most other things that\ncould rival it—like the detonations of the Ashmounts—would be\ncategorized as acts of God. Therefore, I declare that it is. Yes, Wayne. You\nexploded yourself in the biggest damn explosion a person has ever made in\nthe history of our planet.”\n“Make sure Steris knows,” Wayne said, grinning. “She’s always\ncomplainin’ about my exploding things. This time I saved her hide by doin’\nit. Plus, I made the explosion smaller. That’s gonna break her brain. I made\nit smaller, and it was still the biggest one what ever was.”\nHe felt himself really going now. So, he held out a hand to God. Who,\nsmiling, shook it.\n“I knew you’d glow,” Wayne said, with a wink.\nWith that, Wayne stretched into another place, into another time. He\nstretched into the wind. And into the stars.\nAnd all endless things.\nEPILOGUES\nMARASI\nTEN HOURS AFTER DETONATION\nSomehow, the sun was already rising again when Marasi stumbled off the\ntrain in Elendel. She might have expected the train to be empty, considering\nthe disasters—both prevented and diminished—that had marked the night.\nYet the train was packed. Some traveling to aid those in the waterlogged\nand broken northwestern quarter of Elendel. Others coming to check on\nfamily.

Others returning home from the evacuation to seek a place of\ncomfort in this strange time.\nShe let them swarm around her as she stood on the train plat- form,\nfeeling disjointed. Out of place. Part of that was fatigue. She’d had perhaps\ntwo hours’ sleep back in Bilming, after coordinating with Constable\nBlantach, who had finally accepted the evidence of Entrone’s malfeasance.\nThe testimonies of the people who Marasi and the others had saved—\nespecially the journalists and politicians who TwinSoul had escorted out—\nwould prove vital.\nIt felt wrong to leave the lord mayor and his remaining accomplices in\nthe hands of a constabulary department that had up until recently answered\nto him. But honestly, Marasi wasn’t certain what else she could do. An\nElendel invasion of Bilming wasn’t feasible, considering the disasters and\nthe political situation. She simply had to hope that the testimonies, the\nexplosion, and the overwhelming physical evidence would be enough to\nforce the Bilming constables to do their jobs.\nAt the least, it seemed that Wax and Wayne had left the Set’s\norganizational structure—and military forces—in shambles. They’d found\nTelsin dead on the top of the Shaw. Written, by her own fingernail, on the\nstrangely grey skin of her arm had been the words:\nYou have proven yourselves. For now.\nThe way her god had left her was eerily reminiscent of how the\nAscendant Warrior and the Last Emperor had been discovered at the end of\nthe Catacendre. Strangely peaceful, and …\nAnd rusts, Marasi was zoning out. Standing there as confused as a\nRoughs bumpkin her first time in the city. She forced herself to start\nwalking, moving with the last straggling passengers to leave the train. She\nneeded a bath. She needed something to eat. And she needed …\nA frantic masked figure burst from the crowd ahead, having fought his\nway against the flow of traffic. She wasn’t certain how he’d talked his way\nthrough the ticket gate, but Marasi finally let herself feel a measure of\ncomfort as Allik crashed into her with a powerful embrace.\nThis, she thought as he held her tight, was what it was for. This and a\nmillion other people. But to her … it had been for this most of all.\nAllik pulled back and raised his mask. He’d been crying.\n“It’s all right,” Marasi said, wiping his tears away. “Allik, I’m fine. I\npromise. I thought you were outside the city?”\n“I returned early,” he said. “And these tears aren’t for you, love. We\ntried to get word to you, but … it was chaotic, and the lines were busy…”\nHer world started to crack. “Who?” she whispered.\n“Wayne,” he said.\nNo. It was impossible.\nWayne was practically immortal. He was like … like a rock. The kind\nyou got in your shoe and couldn’t get rid of.\nNo … no, he was the kind you leaned against. When you needed\nsomething stable. He …\nHe was her partner.\nShe knew their job was dangerous. She knew they risked their lives each\nday. Still, she’d always assumed she would be the one who … who …\n“Wax?” she choked out."

But he will heal up.” He\nwinced. “He says … Wayne stayed behind. Detonated the bomb. To save\nthe city…”\nShe grabbed him then, because that break in his voice matched the one\nshe felt inside her, and she needed to hold to something. As they embraced,\nshe felt grief welling up to destroy her.\nShe … she wouldn’t accept it. She wouldn’t believe he was gone.\nHe’d … he’d survived worse than this. She would come home one day and\nhe’d be sitting in her kitchen helping himself to the chocolate.\nAnd if that never happened?\nI can’t deal with that right now, she thought. Not on two hours of sleep.\nShe let the delusion linger. So it could erode, like a stone in the waves,\nover time.\nAllik took her by the shoulders. “You,” he declared, “look like you are\nin need of copious amounts of baked goods. Delivered with an urgency\nrivaling that of a warleader in battle. Yah?”\n“Yah,” she said, embracing him again. “A thousand times yah, Allik.”\n* * *\nAn hour later—full of exotic cakes and biscuits—Marasi snuggled in the\noverstuffed chair of her small flat. She’d finally changed, but not into\npajamas. Instead she wore her uniform. Long skirt, blouse, constable’s\novercoat.\nAllik had given that an odd glance before he’d slipped out—with\ncharacteristic apologies—to buy a bottle of wine. The thing was, as tired as\nMarasi had felt, another emotion dominated. A sense of displacement. An\nawareness that something was wrong.\nShe was struggling to deal with the idea that Wayne was dead. Most of\nher refused to believe, for her own sanity. That was part of it. There was\nanother part though. A sense that something was unfinished, that a question\nhung in the balance. One she had to answer before she could truly rest.\nSo it was no great surprise that soon after Allik left, a knock sounded at\nthe door. It was a young messenger girl, of the variety you could easily hire\nin town for a few clips. They knew the ins and outs of the many tenements,\napartments, and winding streets of the octants better than most postmen.\nThe girl delivered a small envelope before scampering off. Inside was a\ncard with the symbol of the interlocking triangles. The Ghostbloods. There\nwas an address on the back.\nMarasi checked her things. Credentials in her pocket. Handgun in the\nholster at her side. Insignia on her jacket. She didn’t bring a rifle. Today, she\ndidn’t need to be armed so much as equipped.\nShe left a quick note for Allik, promising to return soon, then made her\nway out into the city. Her city.\nShe loved Elendel.

A surprising number actually had the right facts.\nDAWNSHOT AND DEPUTY SAVE DAY.\nDARING LAST-MINUTE RACE TO SAVE ELENDEL!\nBILMING BOMB PREMATURELY DETONATED BY CONSTABLE COURAGE!\nShe wondered what they’d say when they got hold of her story. A hidden\ncavern full of kidnapped people being used to try to create Mistborn?\nMoving photos and Hemalurgic monsters? It was the sort of thing that\nwould fuel broadsheet stories for decades.\nShe strolled toward her destination. Savoring the scents—good and bad,\nbut always potent—the sounds, the feel of a city so alive that even a disaster\ncouldn’t stop it.\nThe Ghostblood base in Elendel was more ostentatious than the one in\nBilming. A grand old-school estate, with stained glass and manicured\ngrounds. Marasi was ushered in without needing to knock, then led to a\ndimly lit room. She assumed she was to sit here and wait, until she noticed\nsomeone at the far side. Seated in a comfortable—but enveloping—chair,\nfine shoes catching the light, his face lost in shadows. But one feature was\nplain: a single spike pushed through his right eye.\nThe Survivor himself.\nShe’d met Death, chatted with kandra, heard Wax speak of Harmony.\nShe was no newcomer to figures from lore stepping out of shadow and into\nher life. This was different somehow. This was the man who had started it\nall. The man who had survived his own murder. This was the man she’d\nbeen taught to worship and revere.\nHere he was. And it was the most intimidating experience of her life.\nShe tried to speak, and found her mouth dry.\nThe door opened and TwinSoul entered, stabilizing himself against the\ndoor handle. Though she’d known him only a short time, it still felt right to\ngive him a hug, which he returned.\n“It is good to see you well, my lady,” he said to her. “And to hear of\nyour accomplishments.”\n“Oh!” Marasi said. “TwinSoul. Moonlight, she—”\n“We’ve heard reports,” TwinSoul said. “She was … forced to use her\nstamp?”\n“Yes,” Marasi said.\n“She will be difficult to recover,” Kelsier said from the shadows. “I may\nhave permanently lost my best agent to this fiasco.”\nMarasi’s first instinct was to rush to apologize. She stopped herself.\n“You’d rather we let the invasion happen?”\nKelsier leaned forward, and she thought she caught a hint of a smile on\nhis lips. Perhaps the stories were true. That he might be a brutal man, but he\nwasn’t a stern one. But who knew? Could you really trust stories from\nhundreds of years ago? And if you could, surely a man changed after living\n—or, well, not staying dead—for four centuries.\n“Go ahead, TwinSoul,” Kelsier said."

If you accept, I would be honored to become your\nmentor, as is our tradition. You may join me on my next mission, to track\nMoonlight down and attempt to restore her natural personality.”\n“This offer comes with access to everything the Ghostbloods know,”\nKelsier said. “We don’t keep secrets from one another.”\n“Even you, Survivor?” Marasi asked, curious. “Do you keep secrets?”\nHe didn’t respond to that. But he did smile again.\n“There is lore and arcana we have access to,” TwinSoul said, “that will\ndelight and awe you, my lady. Our duties lead us to fascinating places—all\nin the service of the very thing you want: protecting Scadrial.”\n“It is not an invitation,” Kelsier added, “that we extend lightly.”\nSo here it was. The question. Did she accept? Lately, she’d wanted so\nbadly to do something more. Every glimpse she got of the larger conflicts—\nthe larger cosmere—made her want to see it in full. Like a woman peeking\nat a sunset through a slit in the wall.\nAnd yet.\n“How long,” she said, “did you know about the Set? How long did you\nknow what they were trying to do? Who Trell was?”\nSilence.\n“We provide answers,” TwinSoul said, “after oaths, my lady. It is our\nway.”\n“Did you share with Harmony?” Marasi asked.\n“Saze,” Kelsier said, “is … erratic lately. There’s a problem brewing\nwith him. One I fear is going to make even today’s events seem trivial by\ncomparison. We must, unfortunately, work in secret. We are too small, too\nweak, as of yet. In the open, forces in the cosmere would crush us.”\nShe didn’t disagree, not entirely. Every lawwoman understood the need\nto work covertly at times.\nAnd yet.\nMarasi turned their card over in her fingers, then held it up and looked at\nthe interlocking bloodred diamonds.\nWas this really what she wanted? She’d been dissatisfied in her service\non occasion. But was there any job you didn’t dislike now and then? As she\nturned the card over again, she remembered why she’d first become a\nconstable. Not just to solve crimes. To solve problems. To make the world a\nbetter place, not merely protect it.\nShe couldn’t do that from the shadows, could she? Others might be able\nto, but Marasi? She’d have to lie to so many people. That violated the\nfundamental oaths she’d taken.\nHave you appreciated it? Armal had asked. That question haunted\nMarasi.\n“Once,” she said, “about seven years ago, I thought everything I’d ever\nwanted had fallen into my lap. I thought I’d figured out what I wanted. Then\nhe walked away. That rejection was among the best things that ever\nhappened to me.”\n“My lady?” TwinSoul said."

We merely have to do what we can with\nwhat we have.” She met Kelsier’s shadowed gaze. “If I join, will you let me\nshare what I discover with the constabulary?”\n“What do you think?” Kelsier asked.\n“I think,” she said, “that I am a servant of the people.” She moved to set\nthe card on the table beside the door. “That any power or authority I have\ncomes from them.

My job is to do the best I\ncan. Even with limited information.” She dropped the card.\nShe still needed to find something. An answer for herself. But this\nwasn’t it.\n“I’m a servant of the government,” Marasi said, “and of the law. Things\nthat you, I believe, have historically had a problem with, Survivor. I\nappreciate your help on this mission. I’d accept it again in the future.” She\nshook her head. “But I’m not a good match for your organization. I won’t\nkeep secrets when the truth could save lives.”\nShe needed to know what was hidden here—but she was a detective.\nShe’d find answers without selling her soul. Even if it was to the Survivor\nhimself.\nKelsier did not seem like the type of man who appreciated being\nrejected. But he did eventually nod in acceptance. She shook hands with\nTwinSoul, offered to help him with Moonlight anyway, then let herself out.\nBack into the city.\nBack to the people of Elendel.\nAnd as she walked among them—hearing their concerns, their fears,\ntheir uncertainty—she remembered things she’d lost to the doldrums of\ndaily work. Plans for her life she’d followed for years, but had eventually\ngrown beyond.\nHad she grown back into them, then?

She is dangerous to us now.”\n“We offered these things freely,” TwinSoul said, “and although she\nrejected us, she did not take from us. Master Kelsier, rein him in.”\n“Enough, Dlavil,” Kelsier said, flicking on the light and leaning back in\nhis seat. “TwinSoul is right. She knows nothing that couldn’t be learned\nfrom a cursory exploration of the cosmere. We might have to move bases,\nbut that’s our own fault. Moonlight was so certain she’d join.”\nDlavil held his tongue, his eyes inscrutable behind that cursed mask.\nTwinSoul hated being unable to get a full read on the man’s expressions, but\nDlavil—like his sister who ran amok on Roshar—wore a mask that he\nnever removed; it was grown in to the point that it was practically part of\nhis skin.\n“I mean it, Dlavil,” Kelsier said. “You will not move against her, or\nanyone in this city, without my permission. You understand?”\n“Yes, Lord Kelsier,” Dlavil said, and withdrew through the back door.\nKelsier sighed audibly, rising from his seat. He joined TwinSoul beside\nthe window, where they looked out at the city.\n“Good work yesterday,” Kelsier told him. “Very good work, old friend.\nWe almost lost everything.”\nTwinSoul bowed his head in acceptance of the praise. It felt good.\nYou are blessed, Silajana said in his mind. And worthy of commendation.\nThat felt even better.\n“It should never have gotten this far,” Kelsier said. “Something is wrong\nwith Sazed. It’s getting worse.”\n“What do we do, my lord?” TwinSoul asked.\nKelsier narrowed his eye. “I,” he whispered softly, “am going to have to\nhave a difficult conversation with ‘God.’”\nSTERIS\nTWO DAYS AFTER DETONATION\nOn the second day of the city’s recovery, Steris finally got to bring\nWaxillium home from the hospital. They limped out of Hoid’s car, Wax on\ncrutches, then looked up at the enormous skyscraper that held their suite.\nWax stared at it, his eyes faintly haunted.\n“Thinking of the Shaw?” Steris asked softly.\nHe nodded. “On that rooftop, Wayne made me get him a spike. If I\nhadn’t listened, he wouldn’t have been able to Push me away.”\n“So you could have done what?” she said gently. “Stayed with him to\ndie? He knew what he needed to do.”\nWax looked to her, and she saw the same pain in his eyes that she’d seen\nafter Lessie’s second death. Tempered this time, but haunting nonetheless.\nShe hated seeing him in pain. It happened far too often.\n“I should have at least said goodbye,” Wax whispered. “He left the\nRoughs because of me…”"

It happened far too often.\n“I should have at least said goodbye,” Wax whispered. “He left the\nRoughs because of me…”\n“And he lived because you gave him a second chance,” Steris said. As\nhe was staring up at the roof, she covertly consulted her notes from the\nbooks on trauma she’d been reading. “This wasn’t your fault, Waxillium.\nYou need to allow Wayne his agency, allow him to have made his own\nchoice. You would have sacrificed yourself for the city; we both know it. So\nlet him have the same decision.”\nHe was silent for a moment, and she tried—anxiously—to figure out\nwhat he was feeling. Was that scrunched-up face annoyance? Or was it\npain? Ruin, had she made it worse?\n“You’re right,” he said softly, then blinked tears from his eyes. “You’re\nright, Steris. I need to let him be the hero, don’t I? Harmony … he really is\ngone.”\nShe slipped her notebook into her pocket and held him close, ignoring\nthe world around them. She dimmed everything else, like an old gas lantern\nwith a dial. Turned it down until only the two of them remained. Only the\ntwo of them mattered.\nHe held to her, then took a long, deep breath. “Marasi still doesn’t\nbelieve he’s gone. She thinks he’s going to come sauntering back in a few\nmonths, wearing a straw hat and telling us how great the fruity drinks are in\nthe Malwish Consortium. But she’s wrong. This time it’s over.”\n“Yes,” Steris whispered. “He’s gone. But nothing is over, Wax. You said\nthe same thing when Lessie died. It wasn’t true then. It’s not true now. It\nwill take time for you to believe, but you can trust that it will happen.”\nHe squeezed her hand. “Again, you’re right. How did you get so good at\nthis, Steris?”\n“I learned from Wayne.”\n“About … helping people deal with pain?”\n“No,” she said, then slipped out her notebook. “About cheating.”\nWaxillium smiled. The first genuine one she’d seen from him since the\nincident. Then he handed her his crutches and dropped a spent bullet casing\nto the ground.\n“Oh!” she said. “Are you sure this is wise?”\n“I might be getting old, but I’m not frail,” he said, then grabbed hold of\nher. “You ready?”\n“Always,” she said, feeling an exquisite thrill from anticipating the\nflight. She leaned into him.\nHe propelled them upward, using the metal installations he’d had\nerected here to give him a series of appropriate anchors. A rushing,\nexhilarating ascent with wind in her hair, and the insignificant world\nbecame more tiny. Until it was only the two of them and the sky.\nWax landed them carefully on the platform outside their suite. As he\ntook back his crutches, Steris fished for her notebook.\n“I think…” Wax said. “I think I’m going to be all right.”\n“Good,” she said, flipping a few pages. “I have a Wayne quote for the\nmoment.”\n“A what?”\n“I figured,” she said, “it would be a way of remembering him.

I’m\nsorry.”\n“No,” he said. “I mean, it might be, but he’d approve.”\nShe grinned. “‘Oi,’” she said. “‘Here you carried a girl all that way,\nmate, and you didn’t grab ’er butt, even a little?’”\n“You just made that one up.”\nShe proffered the notebook, showing the line written there.\n“Well, I mean,” Wax said, “we’ve got to do as he says.”\n“It’s the only proper way to honor the dead.”\nHe seized her then, pulled her into a kiss, her figure sculpting to his and\npushing against him in all the right places. It felt amazing—like they were\nliquid, aligned, alive, alight.\nAnd yes, a proper butt-grab was involved. It almost toppled them to the\nside, unbalancing Wax on his good leg. They broke the kiss before an\naccident could befall them, but stayed close.\n“Thank you,” Wax whispered. “For being you.”\n“It’s the only thing I am good at,” she said. “Other than throwing cows\nat people.”\nWax frowned.\n“That is something Wayne said on occasion,” she said.\nIn response to that, he looked to the sky. “Thank you, Wayne. Wherever\nyou are. For letting me have this. For making me live.”\nShe forced him inside then, so he could sit. He wasn’t supposed to put\nweight on that leg, cast or no cast. Even if he could cheat by making\nhimself lighter.\nUnfortunately, Kath had been a little quicker than she’d expected, and\nthe kids were already back from the Harms estate down-Basin. So Wax, in\nflagrant disregard for medical instructions, knelt and scooped Max up in an\nembrace.\n“Daddy!” Max said. “You did it! Kath says you did it!”\n“Did it?” he asked.\n“Stopped the bad guys! Saved the world!”\n“I suppose,” Wax said, “I did a little of both. Wayne helped a lot\nthough.”\n“Jennid at school,” Max continued, “says that you’re also supposed to\nget the girl when you save the world. But that part is stupid. I don’t like\ngirls.”\n“What?” Wax said. “Not even Mommy?”\n“Dad,” Max said, with an exaggerated sense of long-suffering—as if\nthis were the most obvious thing a boy had ever had to describe. “Mommy’s\nnot a girl, she’s a mom.”\nSteris smiled, moving over by Kath as Wax took little Tindwyl and held\nher tight, letting her grab at his sideburns.\n“This came for you,” Kath said softly, taking a letter from her handbag.\n“A short time ago. It looked important.”\n“Thank you,” Steris said, taking the letter—which was addressed to her\n—and noting the governor’s seal on the front.\nHer panic was immediate. She’d worried about this.

Looking over her shoulder, Wax read the letter, then took her\nby the elbow.\n“Steris,” he said, “that’s wonderful.”\n“I don’t deserve it,” she said. “The tsunami wasn’t nearly as bad as I’d\nfeared it would be.”\n“Love,” Wax said, “you do deserve it.”\nShe turned to look him in the eyes.\n“What if instead of quoting Wayne,” he said softly, “we honored him in\na different way. What if we decided to make an effort to let ourselves be\nhappy? What do you think of that, Lady Ladrian?”\n“I think, Lord Ladrian, I should like that very, very much.”\nAnd she could already imagine an entire list of plans to make certain it\nhappened.\nALLRIANDRE\nFIVE DAYS AFTER DETONATION\nAllriandre climbed the steps one at a time. Feet like lead. Legs like slag.\nBack bowed, as if weighed by bars of steel. Her ashen clothing bore a few\nnew marks from the forges, which threw sparks when she passed. Her job\ndidn’t involve working those—she sorted bits of metal for melting down.\nWhen she arrived at her small flat—on the seventh floor, in a building\nwith no elevator—she could already hear Miss Coussaint yelling. Despite\nher exhaustion, Allriandre picked up her pace. She hurried to the door and\nthrew it open, to where her daughter, Ruri—three years old and still small\nfor her age—huddled in her blankets. Terrified again.\n“Why would you think toothpaste was for drawing?” Miss Coussaint\nshouted. She was a woman with a hierarchy of chins, the last—most\nswollen—one lording over the others like a terrible regent. She glanced up\nas Allriandre entered, then held up the toothpaste jar. “Did you see what she\ndid this time?”"

She glanced up\nas Allriandre entered, then held up the toothpaste jar. “Did you see what she\ndid this time?”\n“I’m sorry,” Allriandre said, exhausted, but she scooped up Ruri as she\ncame running into her arms to escape. “Thank you for watching her.”\nCoussaint looked her up and down, noting the dirty face, scraggly hair,\nburned clothing. “Rent?” she demanded. “It’s been three days.”\n“He’s never been late with a payment before.” Wayne, the man who’d\nmurdered her father. “I’m sure he’ll show up soon.”\n“I need to do some renovations,” Coussaint said. “Maybe when he\ncomes, you can—”\n“Thank you, Miss Coussaint,” Allriandre said, stepping aside so the\nwoman could leave. “For watching her. It is an enormous help.”\nThe woman huffed, but squeezed out of the room and went clomping\ndown the steps. Allriandre pulled her daughter close, and thought for a\nmoment about her choices. About how the best schooling in the city didn’t\nmean much when you were in debt to the wrong people. About how\nsomething you loved so much—like the girl she held to now—could also be\na reminder of one of the greatest mistakes you’d ever made.\nShe was exhausted, but she plopped Ruri down, and together the two of\nthem painted with toothpaste on the wall until the girl was laughing again.\nUntil Ruri understood that mistakes could sometimes turn into amazing,\nwonderful, cherished things. With the right perspective.\nA knock came at the door.\nAllriandre froze, then quickly wiped her hands on a rag. She hadn’t been\nexpecting anyone. Rusts, she barely knew anyone. All of her university\nfriends had gone on to marriages, office jobs, and nights spent socializing.\nHer family still lived out in the Roughs, and she’d made sure they didn’t\nknow what had happened to her. Because they had their own problems.\nShe opened the door hesitantly and saw two men in suits outside— one\ntall, one short. Her stomach immediately dropped. Were these Bleaker’s\nnew collection men? They usually showed up a week after she received her\nmonthly payment.\n“Miss Allriandre?” the shorter of the men asked. “I am Mister Call, and\nthis is Mister Daring, of Call and Son and Daughters Accounting and\nEstate. Might we come in? We have a matter of some importance to discuss\nwith you.”\n“I don’t have the money yet,” she said quickly. “I can’t pay you until I\ndo. There’s nothing in here for you to take.”\nThe two shared a glance, then the shorter man gestured again. She\nreluctantly let them in.\n“If you,” she whispered, “hurt my daughter…”\n“We are not who you appear to think we are,” the taller man said with a\ncheerful air, looking at the toothpaste-covered wall, then the ragged\nfurnishings. “We represent the estate of Master Wayne Terrisborn of 662\nInkling Lane.”\n“Oh,” she said, feeling relieved. “Him. Wait. Did he finally get smart\nand decide to stop insisting that I meet him in person?”"

Did he finally get smart\nand decide to stop insisting that I meet him in person?”\n“Indeed he did,” the taller man said, setting his bowler hat on the\ncounter. She winced, noticing the mushed-up apple Ruri had dropped there.\nThe little girl came and climbed into her arms. Strangers made her nervous.\n“Why are you late?” Allriandre asked. “His payments always come on\nthe first of the month.”\nThe taller one coughed. “You haven’t heard? You … don’t read the\nbroadsheets?”\n“Do I look like I have time for broadsheets?” she asked. “If you have my\npayment, that’s great. I could use it. But I really need some sleep. So…”\n“Miss Allriandre,” the shorter man said, “Master Wayne passed last\nweek. It was quite spectacular—he was the one who detonated the bomb.\nDid you hear about that?”\nShe’d heard rumblings of it at the forges. Not his part in it. But the\nwhole flood and, and the evacuations … and … Wait.\n“He’s dead?” she asked.\nThey nodded.\nRusts. How did she feel about that? Happy? The man who had killed her\nfather was finally dead. She should be overjoyed, shouldn’t she?\nInstead she felt confused. A little angry still, yes. That would never leave\nher. A hint of relief. But mostly … sorry. Sorry for how it had all turned out.\nSorry that wounds long dulled sent a pang through her now and then. Sorry\nfor mistakes. Mistakes didn’t always turn into something better, not by a\nlong mile. But she could understand now how they happened. Even the big\nones.\nThe taller man set a large folder onto the room’s only table. “Shall we?”\nhe asked.\n“Shall we what?” she replied.\n“Miss Allriandre,” the shorter man said, “you are the primary\nbeneficiary of Master Wayne’s estate.”\n“What’s that amount to?” she asked. “Three balls of gum and an unpaid\nbar tab?”\n“Currently,” the tall one said, “it’s twenty million boxings—liquid—\nalong with majority stake ownerships in several important holdings,\nequating to at least another hundred.”\nThe room fell silent save for Ruri’s sniffling, which the girl solved by\nwiping her nose on Allriandre’s jumpsuit. Allriandre barely noticed.\n“Did you say … a hundred and twenty million?” she whispered.\n“Give or take, depending on the market,” the taller man said. “He\ninvested wisely—in a brilliant way, actually, against most conventional\nwisdom—using a considerable amount of aluminum as collateral. Turns out\nelectricity, fabrication, and power were the place to be six years ago.”\nThe shorter man pulled over a chair for her. “Please,” he said softly. “Sit\ndown. We have some things to go over.”\n“A hundred and twenty million,” she repeated, her eyes wide, barely\nable to think. Her debts—from her failed art studio—equated to barely ten\nthousand.\n“Yes,” the taller man said, setting out some papers. “By my estimation,\nyou have become the fourth-richest person in the city.” He looked up."

Accounts that Master Wayne set\naside for other things. But that equates to less than five hundred thousand in\ntotal. Everything else … well, it’s yours.”\nShe sank down into the chair.\nThe short man pushed over a note. Handwritten, stained with something.\n“He wanted you to have this.”\nIt simply said, Sorry.\nAs if that could explain all of this. Overwhelmed, she took the note, then\nheld it close to her chest. With money, she could bring her family to\nElendel. Resolve their problems. Build the life for them all that she’d\npromised when they’d put everything into sending her to the city.\nRuri grabbed at the card, getting toothpaste on it.\n“What are the holdbacks for?” Allriandre asked. “Not that I’m\ncomplaining. I’m merely curious.”\nThe two shared a look.\n“Various things,” the shorter man said. “Each one of an … individual\nnature.”\nKELSIER\nTHREE WEEKS AFTER DETONATION\nKelsier, the Survivor, liked high places. Fortunately, the city as it had\nbecome contained plenty of them.\nHe was one of the few who could remember a time when the grand\nkeeps of Luthadel had been considered lofty, stretching up sixteens of feet\ninto the air. Today they would be quaint compared to the city’s dominating\nskyscrapers. The monoliths of modernity.\nKelsier didn’t see quite as he once had. One eye saw as a mortal, the\nother as an immortal. His spiked eye not only pinned his soul to his bones,\nbut gave him a constant overlay of blue, letting him see the world as a being\nlike Sazed did. Outlining not only sources of metal, but all things. The very\naxi that made up matter had their own polarity, influenceable with\nSteelpushing under the right circumstances.\nOne eye of the gods. One eye of the common men. As he had always\ntried to see the world.\nHe had a spectacular view from the top of the skyscraper today. He\ncould remember the joy, the freedom he’d felt all those years ago when he’d\nfirst crested the top of the mists and seen the stars. Now, those stars were\nnaked and bare most nights. Even if the mists were out, it wasn’t too hard to\nfind a building that reached up beyond them, presenting them to full view.\nStars. Suns. Planets.\nEach one a potential threat.\nA figure walked along the edge of the skyscraper’s top toward Kelsier.\nHarmony wasn’t accompanied by his dark double, the shadowy version that\nsometimes appeared these days. A representation of his other self.\n“Marsh is going to live,” Sazed said, settling down beside Kelsier. If you\ndidn’t look directly at him, you could almost ignore the fact that his essence\nextended into eternity.\nSazed spoke like he always had, though he was literally a god now.\nKelsier wasn’t certain if that was because Harmony presented a personality\nthat was familiar to Kelsier, to put him at ease.

Or if the man who had once\nbeen Kelsier’s friend was actually the same person somehow.\n“Marsh will live,” Kelsier said, musing. “Does that mean we have atium\nagain? Or did you find another way?”\n“The kandra found atium dust in Waxillium’s destroyed laboratory,”\nSazed said. “It appears that if you detonate harmonium against trellium—or,\nI suppose bavadinium would be its true name—it creates some small\namount of atium as a by-product.”\n“Lerasium?” Kelsier asked.\n“I’m sorry. That is all annihilated in the explosion. We’ve tested it\nseveral times now.”\nDamn. Another dead end.\n“It wouldn’t work on you anyway,” Sazed said. “Not in your current\nstate.”\n“Doesn’t matter, Saze,” Kelsier said. “We need Allomancers—real\nAllomancers, like in the old days—to face what is coming. This problem\nwith Trell never would have happened if we’d had proper Metalborn.”\n“So you agree with the Set?” Sazed said. “And their monstrous\nundertakings in the name of creating Metalborn?”\nDid he? It was difficult to say. Sometimes to make an omelet, you had to\nbreak a few skulls. He didn’t like what the Set had done to innocent people,\nand would never condone such actions. But if Hemalurgy was demanded,\nthere was always someone around who was the strict opposite of innocent.\n“You don’t know where the Set’s experiments could have led,” Sazed\nsaid. “Even the simple act of trying to breed Allomancers … it leads to\ndarkness, Kell. Trying to create perfect people through forced breeding?\nYou don’t have to be Terris to find that idea nauseating.”\n“Perhaps Ruin and Preservation should have thought about that before\ngiving genetically derived powers to only part of the population. My goal is\nto democratize this. Take the power away from the few, give it to the\nmany.”\nLerasium would have been the easiest way, but it seemed he would have\nto keep hunting. That gave him hope for himself though. Lerasium wouldn’t\nhave worked on him, and Hemalurgy had proven ineffective on what he’d\nbecome. It held his soul and body together, but no more.\nThere had to be another way. He had hope. Ever, he had hope. Hope he\ncould control the metals again. Hope he would be able to soar again. Hope\nhe’d be able to touch the metals he could see in the world all around him.\nThe two sat in silence for a time. They did that more and more, during\ntheir infrequent meetings. Perhaps because both knew it was better than\narguing.\n“I’m fond of heights,” Kelsier eventually said. “More so than when I\nwas fully mortal. Perhaps a part of me holds a grudge against the ground,\nand what she did to me in those caves. Maybe I just try to get as far from\nher as possible.” He paused. “Explosions to make atium.

You’re lucky that lawman could function after what\nyou put him through six years ago. Lucky that the other one was a Slider. I\nstill can’t figure out how he managed that partial detonation in the ship’s\nhold.”\n“Luck is a different thing for a god who can see futures, I think,” Sazed\nreplied softly.\n“Immaterial. This ran to the last minute. You should have stopped Trell\nyears ago. But you didn’t. Why?”\nSazed stared out over the city. Beyond the city. To things Kelsier\ncouldn’t see, even with the eye of a god.\n“You can’t protect this world, Saze,” Kelsier said. “We have to face it.\nSomething’s happening to you.”\n“I have it in hand.”\n“Do you? Do you really?”\nSazed remained there, seated, with his eyes closed. And damn, looking\nat him was disorienting. On the surface was his friend, the calm Terrisman.\nBut he extended. Somehow he was the very stone they were sitting on. The\ncity. The planet. And beyond.\nAnd there was a darkness within him. A different face from the one he\nshowed. The powers were in imbalance. Ruin had always been stronger.\n“What would you have me do?” Sazed asked.\n“There are potential allies out there,” Kelsier said. “Moonlight’s world,\nperhaps. Or the land of the aethers. Hell, maybe even Mythos. We need a\nway to reach them.”\n“Shadesmar—”\n“Is unreliable,” Kelsier said. “I know you’re barely able to get the\nkandra out into the wider cosmere; it’s untenable for large-scale travel.\nBesides, crossing it anymore is like walking into the hands of various gods\nwho absolutely want us dead. There’s got to be a better way.”\n“What are you proposing?” Sazed asked.\n“Lead us into a new technological age,” Kelsier said. “Help us find ways\nto defend ourselves, and perhaps accomplish even more. Autonomy\nconsistently shares with her people the things they can accomplish with\nelectricity and industry. You don’t.”\n“People should discover it on their own,” Sazed said. “If they do not,\nthere are subtle consequences. We should let the decades play out,\nbecoming centuries, and let humankind find their own path to the cosmere\n—”\n“No,” Kelsier said. “We can’t wait centuries; we can barely wait\ndecades. If you don’t do something, we will discover technology on our\nown—when enemy armies bearing it arrive to destroy us. Lead us to a\nrevolution, Saze. Bring us into a new world.”\n“The one we’ve arrived at isn’t progressing quickly enough?”\n“What do you think?” Kelsier asked. “Another few weeks, and they’d\nhave had that rocket working, wouldn’t they?

Whatever it costs.\nPlease tell me I won’t ever have to protect them from you.”\n“That depends,” Sazed said, “entirely upon you, old friend.”\nRANETTE\nSIX MONTHS AFTER DETONATION\nRanette’s honeymoon had been dreadful. Full of relaxing and reading books\nand seeing sights in Malwish. Not a single gun. She’d barely been allowed\nto draw schematics and designs.\n“You’d better appreciate this,” she grumbled to Jaxy as the car pulled up\nto their place in Elendel.\n“You liked it,” Jaxy said, poking her in the side. “Don’t pretend you\ndidn’t like it.”\n“Having fun gets boring too quickly,” Ranette muttered.\n“Just think how refreshed you are,” Jaxy replied. “How many ideas\nflowed when you didn’t have to worry about deadlines or delivery dates!”\n“I like deadlines,” Ranette said.\nJaxy eyed her.\n“Fine,” Ranette said. “It wasn’t awful. It was almost enjoyable. Even if\nthat place is weird. I wish Wax hadn’t discovered it. Then maybe we’d have\ngone to the Roughs.”\n“The Roughs,” Jaxy said. “For our honeymoon.”\nRanette shrugged. “You’re the one who likes that dumb restaurant.”\nJaxy rolled her eyes as the car—strangely—didn’t stop at their place. It\nkept driving.\n“Wait,” Ranette said, turning and looking back.\n“There’s something you need to see,” Jaxy said.\n“This isn’t more ‘fun,’ is it? I’m so full of it by this point, I feel like\nbarfing it all right back out.”\n“You are so romantic,” Jaxy said, taking her arm.\nRanette huffed. Well, she’d been careful not to spoil the actual\nhoneymoon with this kind of behavior. She’d been nice and enjoyable and\nperky.\nOkay. Not perky. But not grouchy. Most of the time. And admittedly, the\nSouthern Continent had been something special. Even if tensions were …\nwell, growing tenser. There was constant talk of closing the borders to\nNortherners. It seemed that tourism was at an end."

It seemed that tourism was at an end.\nRegardless, they were home now. This was supposed to be her time to\ngripe. That was how a relationship worked. Push and Pull. She’d given.\nNow she could take a little. Now she could …\n“What the hell?” she asked as the car came to a stop outside her shop. A\nlittle place on a small plot of land—which had been expanded somehow to\na very large place on a small plot of land.\n“A wedding gift,” Jaxy said.\n“How in the world did you afford this?” Ranette said, throwing the door\nopen and stumbling out.\n“I didn’t. It’s not from me.”\nRanette looked back.\n“Some nice men showed up,” Jaxy explained, “with a sum from Wayne.\nAfter … you know. They said I was supposed to do something nice for you,\nbut—the instructions said clearly—‘Not in a skeevy way.’ He suggested a\nrenovation to the shop.”\nRanette couldn’t help smiling at that. She had been surprised by how\nmuch she’d missed Wayne. Once he had learned—shockingly, people could\nlearn—how to not be slime, they’d actually become friends.\nOf course, he’d gone out in the most incredible explosion ever. So she\nhadn’t felt that bad. If you had to die, then hell, that was the way.\nShe was still trying to figure out how to get her hands on some of those\nexplosives. The things she could build with something that packed that\nmuch of a punch …\n“He left a note,” Jaxy said, handing it to her.\nHey, it said. In crayon. These two fellows in suits told me I gotta write\nthis and make decisions about this stuff, just in case. Apparently they think\nmy job is “high risk.” I told them that if they wanted their jobs to become\nhigh risk, they should try pushin’ me harder to do stupid stuff.\nBut … I guess, if you’re readin’ this, I’m done and gone. Buried. Maybe\nburned. Maybe I got eaten. I dunno. Whatever happened, I hope it’s\nMarasi’s fault, because she’s always tellin’ me I’m gonna get her into\ntrouble and it would be nice if that hat were on her head instead.\nAnyway … I want to say thanks. For not throwin’ the Wayne out with the\nWayne, ya know? Enjoy the gift. Build something real awesome.\n“Damn,” she said, putting her hands on her hips. “I really do miss that\nlittle miscreant.”\nJaxy smiled, leaning into her, holding to her arm. “Ranette. That was\nalmost kind.”\n“I mean it. I miss him.” She smiled. “Wasn’t ever a person I’ve known\nwho was more fun to shoot.”\nMELAAN\nNINETEEN MONTHS AFTER DETONATION\nThe messenger flitted off across the dark ocean of Shadesmar, glowing\nfaintly.\nMeLaan sat in a boat kept afloat by some kind of glowing substance on\nthe hull.

The blackness beneath was like a liquid, more viscous than water.\nIt was supposed to be perfectly transparent—if a person slipped into it and\nsank, you were said to be able to watch them fall, and fall, and fall.\n“Do you know,” MeLaan said, “what those messengers even are?”\n“An Invested entity,” her guide said, “which can read Connection to find\nanyone, anywhere.”\n“That’s … kind of unnerving.”\nHer guide—Jan Ven—shrugged. She was a creature with four arms,\nchalk-white skin, and large almost reptilian eyes. Her white hair was wide,\nlike blades of grass. Sho Del were apparently rare out here, but made\nexcellent guides. Something about having a direct line to their gods.\nThe envelope was stamped with the words SILVERLIGHT MERCANTILE.\nInside she found a note from Harmony. Short, to the point, empathetic.\nWayne had stopped the attack on the city. And had died in the process.\nHer breath caught. She found herself trembling.\nRusts. She was supposed to be better than this. Immortal. Stoic. Why\ncouldn’t she be like the others?\nShe’d known she wouldn’t see him again. But this? She’d wanted him to\nfind someone else. For his own good. And if she was being honest, for her\nown good. Because he made her forget what she was. Because with him the\nworld was too interesting, and that made her forget what was smart.\nDead? He …\nIt was supposed to have been a mere fling. She was just too damn awful\nat being immortal. She folded the letter, then placed it carefully into her\njacket.\n“Bad news?” Jan Ven asked, paddling them softly across the infinite\nblack expanse.\n“Yes,” MeLaan whispered.\n“Do you want to put off the landing?”\nMeLaan turned. There was land ahead. And lights that seemed too alive\nfor the cold fire of this strange place. People crowded around, hundreds of\nthem, with strange outfits, many with odd red hair. Lost.\nThis was her task. To save those people.\n“No,” MeLaan said, standing. “I have a duty here.”\nAfter all, she could remake, rebuild, and regenerate her heart. That was\nwhat her kind did.\nWAXILLIUM\nTWO YEARS AFTER DETONATION\nThe most difficult thing about commissioning Wayne’s statue had been\ndeciding which hat it should be wearing. In the end, the answer had been\nobvious. They had to make it changeable.\nSo it was that Wax and Steris stood before a remarkably accurate bronze\ndepiction of Wayne wearing a removable bronze version of his lucky hat.\nHe was larger than life-size, smiling slyly, with an outstretched hand. Likely\nso that he could pick your pocket with the other, but most people would\nthink he was offering help.\nThey figured they’d replace the hat once a year. Keep things fresh,\ninteresting. It wasn’t the official unveiling yet, but the artist had let Wax and\nSteris come to see it. Fences kept others away as they promenaded along\nthe Field of Rebirth at the very hub of Elendel.

The knoll where people had\nfirst emerged after the remaking of the world.\nThe statues of the Ascendant Warrior and the Last Emperor were just far\nenough away that if Wayne’s had been alive, he could have hit them on the\nbacks of their heads with an occasional thrown pebble. That seemed\nappropriate.\nSteris knelt down to read the inscription.\n“‘You’re meant to be helping people,’” she read, then noticed a second,\nsmaller inscription plaque at the bottom, near the base. Wax winced as she\nread this one too.\n“‘Ain’t no fellow who regretted giving it one extra shake,’” she read,\n“‘but you can bet every guy has regretted giving one too few.’ I can’t\nbelieve you used that quote.”\n“The lower plaque can be removed,” Wax said quickly. “We’ll change it\nup now and then too. But … well, that quote was something he explicitly\nasked for.”\nShe stood up and shook her head, but he could tell she was already\nthinking this would be a good place to put some of the more choice quotes\nshe’d recorded.\nWax remained standing, looking up at the visage of his friend. The dull\nache remained. Always would. But Wax had been living his life. He, Steris,\nand the kids were preparing for another tour of the Roughs. A political tour,\nto drum up support for their bid to become a province in the changing face\nof the Basin.\nTwo years of hard work had staved off civil war. Real progress had\nfinally led to a national assembly for the cities of the Basin. The Roughs\nwere next. Some there wanted to be their own country; he hoped to\npersuade them they’d be better united.\nThe gate to the fence slammed, and shortly Marasi stepped up to the\nstatue, wearing Wayne’s actual lucky hat. Wayne had left it to her. A last-\nminute addition to the will, they’d been told. At first, Wax had thought he\nhadn’t been left anything specific. Then certain items had started …\nshowing up.\nHe held up the latest one for Marasi to see.\n“A desiccated frog?” Marasi asked.\n“Taxidermied,” Wax said. “Was in my coat pocket this morning. Along\nwith a note apologizing. Apparently the instructions had been for a live\nfrog, but they hadn’t quite been able to bring themselves to do it.”\n“You ever find out who he paid to do this?” Marasi asked, taking the\nfrog by one leg.\n“I assume it’s the men who handle his estate,” Wax said, “from how\npolite and apologetic the notes are. I haven’t had the heart to confront them\nabout it.”\n“You should just let it keep happening,” Steris said.\nHe frowned as she stepped up to him. “You don’t think it’s gross? Last\ntime was half a sandwich.”\n“It is obviously gross,” she said. “But … well, it shows remarkable\nplanning on Wayne’s part. It’s the sort of thing we should encourage.”\n“He’s dead,” Marasi pointed out.\n“It’s the sort of thing we should respect, then,” Steris said.\nMarasi eyed the frog. “They say that in gift-giving, it’s the thought that"

So … um … how do we interpret this?”\nWax sighed. “I’m sure they’ll run out of items on his list soon enough.”\nBoth women stared at him.\n“Did you know Wayne?” Marasi asked. “When in his life did he ever let\na joke die?”\nIt was … a fair point. And from what they’d learned about Wayne’s\nremarkable finances, he’d had the money to keep this joke going for a long,\nlong time. And, well, things like the frog were aggravating. And endearing.\nBoth at once.\nJust like Wayne had been.\n“Are you ready for your trip, Marasi?” Steris asked.\nMarasi grimaced. “Physically? Yes. We’re packed. But mentally?\nEmotionally?”\n“You’ll do wonderfully,” Steris said. “You’re going to be the best\nrusting ambassador the damn Basin ever had!”\nMarasi cocked her head.\n“Using respectful language,” Steris explained, looking up at the statue\nof Wayne, “considering the location.”\n“She’s right,” Wax said to Marasi. “You’re exactly what we need. A\nBasin woman with a Malwish partner. A distinguished public servant with a\nrecord for being fair but tough. The leaders of the Southern nations will\nlisten to you.”\nMarasi nodded, her expression firm.\n“Have to be honest,” Wax said, broaching the topic, “I’m a little\nsurprised to see you leaving the constabulary behind. A part of me thought\nyou’d never walk away. It was your dream.”\n“No,” she said. “My dream was to do more. Always has been.”\n“I suppose you can do that as ambassador,” Wax said.\nMarasi smiled, arms folded. He was happy to see how confident she’d\nbeen lately.\n“You’re planning something,” Wax said, finding himself amused. “What\nis it, Marasi?”\n“I realized a while ago that there was something I wanted to do,\nsomething I wanted to accomplish,” Marasi said. “But I needed experience I\ndidn’t have yet. I think becoming ambassador will help.”\nWax frowned at that, trying to pick out what she meant. But before he\ncould press further, Steris spoke.\n“Hopefully you can calm the tensions,” she said. “If anyone can get\nthem to start opening up trade with us again, it will be you.”\nHe agreed with the sentiment. Wax hadn’t been in the meeting where the\nBands had been brought out and found drained, but it smelled of a setup to\nhim. Unfortunately, since the events of the detonation, relations had grown\nincreasingly tense. The Basin felt the Bands had been taken unjustly, and\nthe Malwish claimed that the Basin had shown aggression by even\nconsidering using them.\nBut the Bands were merely a symbol. Part of a larger power play. A new\nfaction in Malwish—the one in control of their unification—kept talking\nabout how Northern disasters had caused them so much hardship over the\ncenturies, and warned that the discovery of these bombs was only the next\nstep. They saw the North as chaotic, unpredictable."

They saw the North as chaotic, unpredictable.\nListening to this group, the Malwish Consortium had forbidden things\nlike tourism and even most forms of trade between continents. Most\nimportantly, they’d forbidden any transfer of harmonium to Northern\ninterests.\nNo harmonium meant no airships. And no Investiture bombs, though\ntrellium was the rarer component of that particular device. Unfortunately,\nthe Basin had enough of both metals squirreled away to be dangerous. And\ndespite his arguments against it, the Basin had been looking into developing\nweapons using those remnants.\nThey’d entered a new age. War was one of the main disasters Steris had\nto spend her time preparing for. It wouldn’t come to that. Hopefully. If only\nhe could figure out who had drained the Bands …\nDon’t go down that path, he thought.\nYet if he didn’t ask those kinds of questions, who was he? Lawman?\nFather? Senator?\nQuestions were part of who he was. He just wished he knew for certain\nthat the choice was his. Though, as he considered—his old instincts\nworking on his behalf—he thought maybe he could piece together what\nMarasi was planning. Judging by the way she was glancing back at the line\nof political picket signs in the grass nearby. By the way she’d strategically\nchosen such a high-profile appointment.\nShe said she needed experience. Negotiating, perhaps. Soothing egos.\nTrying to get people to get along …\n“Rusts,” he said, pointing at her. “You’re planning to run for governor.”\nShe jumped at the exclamation. Then blushed. Then she raised her chin\nand nodded.\nWax looked to Steris, who was smiling. “You knew?”\n“She needed help planning,” Steris said. “But the secret wasn’t mine to\nshare.”\n“I had to really decide,” Marasi said. “Had to know for myself, Wax. I\nneed experience. I need to see if I’m any good at this sort of work. But …\nyes.”\nHuh.\n“I found I couldn’t content myself with a constable’s job,” she said,\n“after what I’d seen and learned. I needed to be able to change things.\nActually change things.” She glanced at him. “Do you think I’m foolish?\nFor years, in my youth, I thought maybe I was being trained to enter\npolitics. I ran away from that, but now…”\nThey locked eyes. And she seemed to realize, for the first time, what she\nwas saying. Who she was saying it to. Yes, he understood that feeling. He\nnodded to her, then glanced again at the quote on Wayne’s plaque. Those\nwords he’d said, years ago now. You’re meant to be helping people.\nAnother figure approached, this one wearing a long black coat and hat.\nHe stepped up beside them, inspecting the statue through spiked eyes.\n“It looks good,” Death said.\n“How is it,” Steris said, “you walk around without drawing attention?”\n“Emotional Allomancy,” he said absently.\n“You seem better,” Marasi said. “The treatment is working.”\n“Thank you,” he replied. “I prefer not to taste of my own offerings.

It\nseems I won’t have to for some time.” He turned to Wax. “Greetings,\nBrother.”\nWax felt at his abdomen, where he bore his spike. Though he’d been\nassured being called “brother” by the likes of the kandra and Death didn’t\nmean he was immortal, it did make him uncomfortable. He’d joined the\nranks of an extremely disturbing group. The spiked.\n“I’ve considered removing it,” Wax said.\n“I will help if you wish,” Death said. “But not all of them can be\nremoved. I nearly lost one once that would have ended me. Still find it\namazing that I survived.”\n“Perhaps it’s in the blood,” Steris said.\n“Perhaps it is at that.” He hesitated. “Harmony wants me to express his\nregards.”\nGod could have spoken into Wax’s head because of the spike. But he\nhad—by Wax’s request—vowed never to do so, unless asked. He said he\nwouldn’t even watch.\nThe spike, though, continued to perpetuate a problem. Who was Wax?\nFather, lawman, senator? Or was he none of the three? A part of him still\nworried, after all these years, that he was something else entirely. A pawn.\n“Ironeyes?” Marasi asked. “Is … is Wayne really gone? Like … are we\nabsolutely certain?”\nDeath smiled. “I didn’t meet his soul, Marasi. I only do that some of the\ntime, when Saze Invests me with the power. I think he likes the idea of me\nliving up to the stories people decided to tell about me. It’s … his way.\n“Regardless, I didn’t meet Wayne as he left. Harmony did that\npersonally. Yes, your friend is gone.” He nodded to the statue. “Remarkable\nlikeness … It took an intervention to get Vin’s right. But this is spot- on\nfrom the first try.”\nHe nodded to the group of them, then handed a small note to Wax. From\nthere, Death withdrew. Wax didn’t buy his explanation of using emotional\nAllomancy to remain hidden. There was something more here.\nHe turned over the card that Death had given him. It was from Harmony.\nI’ve heard distressing things, Waxillium Ladrian, that you’ve been\nworrying about. I would like to promise you something. With all the\nessence and axi of my being, I declare this.\nNo one else moves you.\nYour life is yours.\nAnd you have my deepest apologies that I had a hand in teaching\nyou otherwise.\nWax held that card for a long time. Then he tucked it into his pocket. He\ntook Steris’s hand and looked up at the statue.\nWho was he? He supposed … well, he was whoever he wanted to be.\nNo decision had ever forced him to choose one role over others—and being\none man did not prevent him from being the others as well. He kept making\nthat mistake, but he vowed right then to stop. To listen to his wife, to his\nheart, and to Harmony himself."

Firesoul\nFerrings can store warmth in a brass metalmind, cooling themselves off\nwhile actively storing.

Different metals produce different\npulses. Sentry Ferrings can store wakefulness in a bronze metalmind,\nmaking themselves drowsy while actively storing. They can tap the\nmetalmind at a later time to reduce drowsiness or to heighten their\nawareness.\nCADMIUM: Pulser Mistings burn cadmium to stretch time in a bubble around\nthemselves, making it pass more slowly inside the bubble.

Spinner Ferrings\ncan store Fortune in a chromium metalmind, making themselves unlucky\nduring active storage, and can tap it at a later time to increase their luck.\nCOPPER: Coppercloud Mistings (a.k.a. Smokers) burn copper to create an\ninvisible cloud around themselves, which hides nearby Allomancers from\nbeing detected by a Seeker and which shields the Smoker from the effects\nof emotional Allomancy. Archivist Ferrings can store memories in a\ncopper metalmind (coppermind); the memory is gone from their head\nwhile in storage, and can be retrieved with perfect recall at a later time.\nDURALUMIN: A Mistborn who burns duralumin instantly burns away any\nother metals being burned at the time, releasing an enormous burst of\nthose metals’ power.

Pushes must be directly away from the Coinshot’s center of\ngravity. Steelrunner Ferrings can store physical speed in a steel\nmetalmind, slowing them while actively storing, and can tap it at a later\ntime to increase their speed.\nTIN: Tineye Mistings who burn tin increase the acuity of their five senses.\nAll are increased at the same time. Windwhisperer Ferrings can store the\nacuity of one of the five senses into a tin metalmind; a different tin\nmetalmind must be used for each sense. While storing, their acuity in that\nsense is reduced, and when the metalmind is tapped that sense is\nenhanced.\nZINC: Rioter Mistings burn zinc to Riot (enflame) the emotions of nearby\nindividuals. This can be directed at a single individual or across a general\narea, and the Rioter can focus on specific emotions. Sparker Ferrings can\nstore mental speed in a zinc metalmind, dulling their ability to think and\nreason while actively storing, and can tap it at a later time to think and\nreason more quickly.\nON THE THREE METALLIC ARTS\nOn Scadrial, there are three prime manifestations of Investiture. Locally,\nthese are spoken of as the “Metallic Arts,” though there are other names for\nthem.\nAllomancy is the most common of the three. It is end-positive,\naccording to my terminology—meaning that the practitioner draws in\npower from an external source. The body then filters it into various forms."

The body then filters it into various forms.\n(The actual outlet of the power is not chosen by the practitioner, but instead\nis hardwritten into their spiritweb.) The key to drawing this power comes in\nthe form of various types of metals, with specific compositions being\nrequired. Though the metal is consumed in the process, the power itself\ndoesn’t actually come from the metal. The metal is a catalyst, you might\nsay, that begins an Investiture and keeps it running.\nIn truth, this isn’t much different from the form-based Investitures one\nfinds on Sel, where specific shape is the key—here, however, the\ninteractions are more limited. Still, one cannot deny the raw power of\nAllomancy. It is instinctive and intuitive for the practitioner, as opposed to\nrequiring a great deal of study and exactness, as one finds in the form-based\nInvestitures of Sel.\nAllomancy is brutal, raw, and powerful. There are sixteen base metals\nthat work, though two others—named the “God Metals” locally—can be\nused in alloy to craft an entirely different set of sixteen each. As these God\nMetals are no longer commonly available, the other metals are not in wide\nuse.\nFeruchemy is still widely known and used at this point on Scadrial.\nIndeed, you might say that it is more present today than it has been in many\neras past, when it was confined to distant Terris or hidden from sight by the\nKeepers.\nFeruchemy is an end-neutral art, meaning that power is neither gained\nnor lost. The art also requires metal as a focus, but instead of being\nconsumed, the metal acts as a medium by which abilities within the\npractitioner are shuttled through time. Invest that metal on one day,\nwithdraw the power on another day. It is a well-rounded art, with some\nfeelers in the Physical, some in the Cognitive, and even some in the\nSpiritual. The last powers are under heavy experimentation by the Terris\ncommunity, and aren’t spoken of to outsiders.\nIt should be noted that the interbreeding of the Feruchemists with the\ngeneral population has diluted the power in some ways. It is now common\nfor people to be born with access to only one of the sixteen Feruchemical\nabilities. It is hypothesized that if metalminds could be made from alloys\nwith the God Metals, other abilities could be discovered.\nHemalurgy is less widely known in the modern world of Scadrial. Its\nsecrets were kept close by those who survived their world’s rebirth, and the\nonly known practitioners of it now are the kandra—who for the most part\nserve Harmony—a few scattered koloss clans, and the Set.\nHemalurgy is an end-negative art. Some power is lost in the practice of\nit. Though many through history have maligned it as an “evil” art, none of\nthe Investitures are actually evil. At its core, Hemalurgy deals with\nremoving abilities—or attributes—from one person and bestowing them on\nanother. It is primarily concerned with things of the Spiritual Realm, and is\nof the greatest interest to me. If one of these three arts is of great"

If one of these three arts is of great\nimportance to the cosmere, it is this one. I think there are numerous\npossibilities for its use.\nCOMBINATIONS\nIt is possible on Scadrial to be born with ability to access both Allomancy\nand Feruchemy. This has been of specific interest to me lately, as the mixing\nof different types of Investiture has curious effects. One need look only at\nwhat has happened on Roshar to find this manifested—two powers,\ncombined, often have an almost chemical reaction. Instead of getting out\nexactly what you put in, you get something new.\nOn Scadrial, someone with one Allomantic power and one Feruchemical\npower is called “Twinborn.” The effects here are more subtle than they are\nwhen mixing Surges on Roshar, but I am convinced that each unique\ncombination also creates something distinctive. Not just two powers, you\ncould say, but two powers … and an effect. This demands further study.\nON SPIKES AND COMPOUNDING\nSomething odd is happening with the nature of spikes and Hemalurgy on\nScadrial, of particular note to any arcanists who study the nature of Intent\nand Connection. I have, after lengthy questing, obtained an interview with\nMarsh, the one known as Ironeyes on Scadrial. (As a side note, it is curious\nhow news of his nature is spreading to other worlds. Is this natural\nrumormongering, or something more supernatural?)\nI can confirm, as best as it can be attested, that he is fully capable of\nCompounding to expand his life. He speaks of things of the past, like\nHemalurgic decay and the toll that holding so many spikes takes upon the\nbody. Inquisitors during his day slept for many hours; the Words of\nFounding say this was due to the need for storing health, but Marsh\nindicates there may be more subtlety to it than first understood. I’d postulate\nthat it was in part a side effect of the incredible burden placed upon their\nsouls by the nature of their horrific transformations.\nModern souls, however, seem to simply reject spikes of this magnitude.\nFurther research is required, but I believe that this has something to do with\nthe nature of Ruin’s subservience to Preservation in the current dual vessel\nknown as Harmony. The level of corruption of a soul that was possible in\nancient days is no longer viable; if too many spikes are added, souls stop\ngaining powers. Marsh doesn’t think this is a conscious decision on\nHarmony’s part. Indeed, I think this is beyond the conscious abilities of\neven a Shard.\nInstead, I believe this is the nature of souls (read: the Invested portion of\na person’s nature) and their balance with the cosmere. In the ancient days,\nRuin was pushing hard on the fabric of Scadrial, leaking into spirit- webs\nthrough any method possible. Causing souls to decay faster, to accept more\nspikes than they should have been able to, and leaving the resulting person\nburdened beyond what was reasonable.\nAt any rate, the end result is a limit on the number of spikes a person"
