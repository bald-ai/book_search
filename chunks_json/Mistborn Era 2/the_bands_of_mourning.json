Considering all the other things I’ve been doing, it seems\nlike six books in ten years is a grand accomplishment! I can still remember\nthe early months, writing the trilogy furiously, trying to craft something that\nwould really show off what I can do as a writer. Mistborn has become one\nof my hallmark series, and I hope that you find this volume a worthy entry\nin the canon.\nAs always, this book involved the efforts of a great number of people.\nThere’s the excellent art by Ben McSweeney and Isaac Stewarϯ—maps and\nicons by Isaac, with all the broadsheet art done by Ben. Both also helped a\ngreat deal on the text of the broadsheet, and Isaac himself wrote the Nicki\nSavage piece for it—since the idea was to have Jak hiring out his work now,\nwe wanted to give that a different voice. I think it turned out great!\nThe cover art was done by Chris McGrath in the US, and by Sam Green\nfor the UK edition. Both are longtime artists on this series, and their art\nkeeps getting better. Editorial was done by Moshe Feder at Tor, with Simon\nSpanton shepherding the project over at Gollancz in the UK. Agents on the\nproject included Eddie Schneider, Sam Morgan, Krystyna Lopez, Christa\nAtkinson, and Tae Keller at Jabberwocky in the US, all overseen by the\namazing Joshua Bilmes. In the UK you can thank John Berlyne of the Zeno\nAgency, an all-around awesome guy who worked hard for many years to\nfinally break my books into the UK.\nAt Tor Books, I’d also like to thank Tom Doherty, Linda Quinton, Marco\nPalmieri, Karl Gold, Diana Pho, Nathan Weaver, and Rafal Gibek.\nCopyediting was done by Terry McGarry. The audiobook narrator is\nMichael Kramer, my personal favorite narrator—and one I know I’m\nprobably making blush right now, as he has to read this line to you all who\nare listening. At Macmillan Audio, I’d like to thank Robert Allen, Samantha"

At Macmillan Audio, I’d like to thank Robert Allen, Samantha\nEdelson, and Mitali Dave.\nContinuity, all-around editing feedback, and countless other jobs were\ndone by the Immaculate Peter Ahlstrom. Also working here on my team are\nKara Stewart, Karen Ahlstrom, and Adam Horne. And, of course, my lovely\nwife, Emily.\nWe leaned extra hard on my beta readers for this one, as the book didn’t\nhave the chance to go through writing group. That team is: Peter Ahlstrom,\nAlice Arneson, Gary Singer, Eric James Stone, Brian T. Hill, Kristina\nKugler, Kim Garrett, Bob Kluttz, Jakob Remick, Karen Ahlstrom, Kalyani\nPoluri, Ben “wooo this book is dedicated to me, look how important I am”\nOlsen, Lyndsey Luther, Samuel Lund, Bao Pham, Aubree Pham, Megan\nKanne, Jory Phillips, Trae Cooper, Christi Jacobsen, Eric Lake, and Isaac\nStewarϯ. (For those wondering, Ben was a founding member of my original\nwriting group with Dan Wells and Peter Ahlstrom. A computer person by\ntrade, and the only one of us in that original group who had no aspirations\ntoward working in publishing, he’s been a valued reader and friend for\nmany years. He also introduced me to the Fallout series, so there’s that as\nwell.) Community proofreaders included most of the above plus: Kerry\nWilcox, David Behrens, Ian McNatt, Sarah Fletcher, Matt Wiens, and Joe\nDowswell.\nWell, that was a mouthful! These folks are wonderful, and if you\ncompare my early books to my later ones, I think you’ll find that the\nassistance of these people has been invaluable in not only slaying typos but\nalso helping me tighten narratives. Finally, though, I’d like to thank you\nreaders for sticking with me these ten years, and being willing to accept the\nstrange ideas I throw at you. Mistborn is not quite halfway through the\nevolution I have planned for it. I can’t wait for you to see what is coming\nyour way, and this book is where some of that finally starts to be revealed.\nEnjoy!\nPROLOGUE\n“Telsin!” Waxillium hissed as he crept out of the training hut.\nGlancing back, Telsin winced and crouched lower. At sixteen, Waxillium’s\nsister was one year older than he was. Her long dark hair framed a button\nnose and prim lips, and colorful V shapes ran up the front of her traditional\nTerris robes. Those always seemed to fit her in a way his never did. On\nTelsin, they were elegant. Waxillium felt like he was wearing a sack.\n“Go away, Asinthew,” she said, inching around the side of the hut.\n“You’re going to miss evening recitation.”\n“They won’t notice I’m gone. They never check.”\nInside the hut, Master Tellingdwar droned on about proper Terris attitudes.\nSubmission, meekness, and what they called “respectful dignity.” He was\nspeaking to the younger students; the older ones, like Waxillium and his"

        "text": "Submission, meekness, and what they called “respectful dignity.” He was\nspeaking to the younger students; the older ones, like Waxillium and his\nsister, were supposed to be meditating.\nTelsin scrambled away, moving through the forested area of Elendel\nreferred to simply as the Village. Waxillium fretted, then hurried after his\nsister.\n“You’re going to get into trouble,” he said once he caught up. He followed\nher around the trunk of an enormous oak tree. “You’re going to get me into\ntrouble.”\n“So?” she said. “What is it with you and rules anyway?”\n“Nothing,” he said. “I just—”\nShe stalked off into the forest. He sighed and trailed after her, and\neventually they met up with three other Terris youths: two girls and a tall\nboy. Kwashim, one of the girls, looked Waxillium up and down. She was\ndark-skinned and slender. “You brought him?”\n“He followed me,” Telsin said.\nWaxillium smiled at Kwashim hopefully, then at Idashwy, the other girl.\nShe had wide-set eyes and was his own age. And Harmony … she was\ngorgeous. She noticed his attention on her and blinked a few times, then\nglanced away, a demure smile on her lips.\n“He’ll tell on us,” Kwashim said, drawing his attention away from the\nother girl. “You know he will.”\n“I won’t,” Waxillium snapped.\nKwashim gave Waxillium a glare. “You might miss evening class. Who’ll\nanswer all the questions? It will be rusting quiet in the classroom with\nnobody to fawn over the teacher.”\nForch, the tall boy, stood just inside the shadows. Waxillium didn’t look at\nForch, didn’t meet his eyes. He doesn’t know, right? He can’t know. Forch\nwas the oldest of them, but rarely said much.\nHe was Twinborn, like Waxillium. Not that either of them used their\nAllomancy much these days. In the Village, it was their Terris side—their\nFeruchemy—that was lauded. The fact that both he and Forch were\nCoinshots didn’t matter to the Terris.\n“Let’s go,” Telsin said. “No more arguing. We probably don’t have much\ntime. If my brother wants to tag along, then fine.”\nThey followed her beneath the canopy, feet crackling on leaves. With this\nmuch foliage, you could easily forget you were in the middle of an enormous\ncity. The sounds of shouting men and iron-shod hooves on cobbles were\ndistant, and you couldn’t see or smell the smoke in here. The Terris worked\nhard to keep their section of the city tranquil, quiet, peaceful.\nWaxillium should have loved it here.\nThe group of five youths soon approached the Synod’s Lodge, where the\nranking Terris elders had their offices. Telsin waved for the group of them to\nwait while she hurried up to a particular window to listen. Waxillium found\nhimself looking about, anxious. Evening was approaching, the forest\ngrowing dim, but anyone could walk along and find them.\nDon’t worry so much, he told himself. He needed to join in their antics"

He needed to join in their antics\nlike his sister did. Then they’d see him as one of them. Right?\nSweat trickled down the sides of his face. Nearby, Kwashim leaned\nagainst a tree, completely unconcerned, a smirk growing on her lips as she\nnoticed how nervous he was. Forch stood in the shadows, not crouching, but\nrusts—he could have been one of the trees, for all the emotion he showed.\nWaxillium glanced at Idashwy, with her large eyes, and she blushed, looking\naway.\nTelsin snuck back to them. “She’s in there.”\n“That’s our grandmother’s office,” Waxillium said.\n“Of course it is,” Telsin said. “And she got called into her office for an\nemergency. Right, Idashwy?”\nThe quiet girl nodded. “I saw Elder Vwafendal running past my\nmeditation room.”\nKwashim grinned. “So she won’t be watching.”\n“Watching what?” Waxillium asked.\n“The Tin Gate,” Kwashim said. “We can get out into the city. This is\ngoing to be even easier than usual!”\n“Usual?” Waxillium said, looking in horror from Kwashim to his sister.\n“You’ve done this before?”\n“Sure,” Telsin said. “Hard to get a good drink in the Village. Great pubs\ntwo streets over though.”\n“You’re an outsider,” Forch said to him as he stepped up. He spoke\nslowly, deliberately, as if each word required separate consideration. “Why\nshould you care if we leave? Look, you’re shaking. What are you afraid of?\nYou lived most of your life out there.”\nYou’re an outsider, they said. Why was his sister always able to worm her\nway into any group? Why did he always have to stand on the outside?\n“I’m not shaking,” Waxillium said to Forch. “I just don’t want to get into\ntrouble.”\n“He’s going to turn us in,” Kwashim said.\n“I’m not.” Not for this anyway, Waxillium thought.\n“Let’s go,” Telsin said, leading the pack through the forest to the Tin Gate,\nwhich was a fancy name for something that was really just another street—\nthough granted, it had a stone archway etched with ancient Terris symbols\nfor the sixteen metals.\nBeyond it lay a different world. Glowing gas lamps marching along\nstreets, newsboys trudging home for the night with unsold broadsheets\ntucked under their arms. Workers heading to the rowdy pubs for a drink.\nHe’d never really known that world; he’d grown up in a lavish mansion\nstuffed with fine clothes, caviar, and wine.\nSomething about that simple life called to him. Perhaps he’d find it there.\nThe thing he’d never found. The thing everyone else seemed to have, but he\ncouldn’t even put a name to.\nThe other four youths scuttled out, passing the building with shadowed\nwindows where Waxillium and Telsin’s grandmother would usually be\nsitting and reading this time of night.

The Terris didn’t employ guards at the\nentrances to their domain, but they did watch.\nWaxillium didn’t leave, not yet. He looked down, pulling back the sleeves\nof his robe to expose the metalmind bracers he wore there.\n“You coming?” Telsin called to him.\nHe didn’t respond.\n“Of course you’re not. You never want to risk trouble.”\nShe led Forch and Kwashim away. Surprisingly though, Idashwy lingered.\nThe quiet girl looked back at him questioningly.\nI can do this, Waxillium thought. It’s nothing big. His sister’s taunt ringing\nin his ears, he forced himself forward and joined Idashwy. He felt sick, but\nhe fell in beside her, enjoying her shy smile.\n“So, what was the emergency?” he asked Idashwy.\n“Huh?”\n“The emergency that called Grandmother away?”\nIdashwy shrugged, pulling off her Terris robe, briefly shocking him until\nhe saw that she wore a conventional skirt and blouse underneath. She tossed\nthe robe into the bushes. “I don’t know much. I saw your grandmother\nrunning to the Synod Lodge, and overheard Tathed asking about it. Some\nkind of crisis. We were planning to slip out tonight, so I figured, you know,\nthis would be a good time.”\n“But the emergency…” Waxillium said, looking over his shoulder.\n“Something about a constable captain coming to question her,” Idashwy\nsaid.\nA constable?\n“Let’s go, Asinthew,” she said, taking his hand. “Your grandmother is\nlikely to make short work of the outsider. She could be on her way here\nalready!”\nHe’d frozen in place.\nIdashwy looked at him. Those lively brown eyes made it hard for him to\nthink. “Come on,” she urged. “Sneaking out is hardly even an infraction.\nDidn’t you live out here for fourteen years?”\nRusts.\n“I need to go,” he said, turning back to run toward the forest.\nIdashwy stood in place as he left her. Waxillium entered the woods,\nsprinting for the Synod Lodge. You know she’s going to think you’re a\ncoward now, part of him observed. They all will.\nWaxillium skidded to the ground outside his grandmother’s office\nwindow, heart thumping. He pressed against the wall, and yes, he could hear\nsomething through the open window.\n“We police ourselves, constable,” Grandmother Vwafendal said from\ninside. “You know this.”\nWaxillium dared to push himself up, peeking in the window to see\nGrandmother seated at her desk, a picture of Terris rectitude, with her hair in\na braid and her robes immaculate.\nThe man standing across the desk from her held his constable’s hat under\nhis arm as a sign of respect. He was an older man with drooping mustaches,\nand the insignia on his breast marked him as a captain and a detective. High\nrank. Important.\nYes! Waxillium thought, fiddling in his pocket for his notes."

        "text": "and the insignia on his breast marked him as a captain and a detective. High\nrank. Important.\nYes! Waxillium thought, fiddling in his pocket for his notes.\n“The Terris police themselves,” the constable said, “because they rarely\nneed policing.”\n“They don’t need it now.”\n“My informant—”\n“So now you have an informant?” Grandmother asked. “I thought it was\nan anonymous tip.”\n“Anonymous, yes,” the constable said, laying a sheet of paper on the desk.\n“But I consider this more than just a ‘tip.’”\nWaxillium’s grandmother picked up the sheet. Waxillium knew what it\nsaid. He’d sent it, along with a letter, to the constables in the first place.\nA shirt that smells of smoke, hanging behind his door.\nMuddied boots that match the size of the prints left outside the burned\nbuilding.\nFlasks of oil in the chest beneath his bed.\nThe list contained a dozen clues pointing to Forch as the one who’d\nburned the dining lodge to the ground earlier in the month. It thrilled\nWaxillium to see that the constables had taken his findings seriously.\n“Disturbing,” Grandmother said, “but I don’t see anything on this list that\ngives you the right to intrude upon our domain, Captain.”\nThe constable leaned down to rest his hands on the edge of her desk,\nconfronting her. “You weren’t so quick to reject our help when we sent a fire\nbrigade to extinguish that blaze.”\n“I will always accept help saving lives,” Grandmother said. “But I need no\nhelp in locking them away. Thank you.”\n“Is it because this Forch is Twinborn? Are you frightened of his powers?”\nShe gave him a scornful look.\n“Elder,” he said, taking a deep breath. “You have a criminal among you\n—”\n“If we do,” she said, “we will deal with the individual ourselves. I have\nvisited the houses of sorrow and destruction you outsiders call prisons,\nCaptain. I will not see one of my own immured there based on hearsay and\nanonymous fancies sent via post.”\nThe constable breathed out and stood up straight again. He set something\nnew down on the desk with a snap. Waxillium squinted to see, but the\nconstable was covering the object with his hand.\n“Do you know much about arson, Elder?” the constable asked softly. “It’s\noften what we call a companion crime. You find it used to cover a burglary,\nto perpetrate fraud, or as an act of initial aggression. In a case like this, the\nfire is commonly just a harbinger. At best you have a firebug who is waiting\nto burn again. At worst … well, something bigger is coming, Elder.\nSomething you’ll all regret.”\nGrandmother drew her lips to a line. The constable removed his hand,\nrevealing what he’d put on the desk. A bullet.\n“What is this?” Grandmother said.\n“A reminder.”\nGrandmother slapped it off the table, sending it snapping against the wall\nnear where Waxillium hid. He jumped back and crouched lower, heart\npounding.\n“Do not bring your instruments of death into this place,” Grandmother\nhissed."

He jumped back and crouched lower, heart\npounding.\n“Do not bring your instruments of death into this place,” Grandmother\nhissed.\nWaxillium got back to the window in time to see the constable settling his\nhat on his head. “When that boy burns something again,” he said softly,\n“send for me. Hopefully it won’t be too late. Good evening.”\nHe left without a further word. Waxillium huddled against the side of the\nbuilding, worried the constable would look back and see him. It didn’t\nhappen. The man marched out along the path, disappearing into the evening\nshadows.\nBut Grandmother … she hadn’t believed. Couldn’t she see? Forch had\ncommitted a crime. They were just going to leave him alone? Why—\n“Asinthew,” Grandmother said, using Waxillium’s Terris name as she\nalways did. “Would you please join me?”\nHe felt an immediate spike of alarm, followed by shame. He stood up.\n“How did you know?” he said through the window.\n“Reflection on my mirror, child,” she said, holding a cup of tea in both\nhands, not looking toward him. “Obey. If you please.”\nSullenly, he trudged around the building and through the front doors of the\nwooden lodge. The whole place smelled of the wood stain he’d recently\nhelped apply. He still had the stuff under his fingernails.\nHe stepped into the room and shut the door. “Why did you—”\n“Please sit down, Asinthew,” she said softly.\nHe walked to the desk, but didn’t take the guest seat. He remained\nstanding, right where the constable had.\n“Your handwriting,” Grandmother said, brushing at the paper the\nconstable had left. “Did I not tell you that the matter of Forch was under\ncontrol?”\n“You say a lot of things, Grandmother. I believe when I see proof.”\nVwafendal leaned forward, steam rising from the cup in her hands. “Oh,\nAsinthew,” she said. “I thought you were determined to fit in here.”\n“I am.”\n“Then why are you listening at my window instead of doing evening\nmeditations?”\nHe looked away, blushing.\n“The Terris way is about order, child,” Grandmother said. “We have rules\nfor a reason.”\n“And burning down buildings isn’t against the rules?”\n“Of course it is,” Grandmother said. “But Forch is not your responsibility.\nWe’ve spoken to him. He’s penitent. His crime was that of a misguided\nyouth who spends too much time alone. I’ve asked some of the others to\nbefriend him. He will do penance for his crime, in our way. Would you rather\nsee him rot in prison?”\nWaxillium hesitated, then sighed, dropping into the chair before his\ngrandmother’s desk. “I want to find out what is right,” he whispered, “and do\nit. Why is that so hard?”\nGrandmother frowned. “It’s easy to discover what is right and wrong,\nchild. I will admit that always choosing to follow what you know you should\ndo is—”\n“No,” Waxillium said. Then he winced. It wasn’t wise to interrupt"

        "text": "child. I will admit that always choosing to follow what you know you should\ndo is—”\n“No,” Waxillium said. Then he winced. It wasn’t wise to interrupt\nGrandmother V. She never yelled, but her disapproval could be sensed as\nsurely as an imminent thunderstorm. He continued more softly. “No,\nGrandmother. Finding out what’s right isn’t easy.”\n“It is written in our ways. It is taught every day in your lessons.”\n“That’s one voice,” Waxillium said, “one philosophy. There are so\nmany.…”\nGrandmother reached across the desk and put her hand on his. Her skin\nwas warm from holding the teacup. “Ah, Asinthew,” she said. “I understand\nhow hard it must be for you. A child of two worlds.”\nTwo worlds, he thought immediately, but no home.\n“But you must heed what you are taught,” Grandmother continued. “You\npromised me you would obey our rules while you were here.”\n“I’ve been trying.”\n“I know. I hear good reports from Tellingdwar and your other instructors.\nThey say you learn the material better than anyone—that it’s as if you’ve\nlived here all your life! I’m proud of your effort.”\n“The other kids don’t accept me. I’ve tried to do as you say—to be more\nTerris than anyone, to prove my blood to them. But the kids … I’ll never be\none of them, Grandmother.”\n“‘Never’ is a word youths often use,” Grandmother said, sipping her tea,\n“but rarely understand. Let the rules become your guide. In them, you will\nfind peace. If some are resentful because of your zeal, let them be.\nEventually, through meditation, they will make peace with such emotions.”\n“Could you … maybe order a few of the others to befriend me?” he found\nhimself asking, ashamed of how weak it sounded to say the words. “Like\nyou did with Forch?”\n“I will see,” Grandmother said. “Now, off with you. I will not report this\nindiscretion, Asinthew, but please promise me you will set aside this\nobsession with Forch and leave the punishment of others to the Synod.”\nWaxillium moved to stand up, and his foot slipped on something. He\nreached down. The bullet.\n“Asinthew?” Grandmother asked.\nHe trapped the bullet in his fist as he straightened, then hurried out the\ndoor.\n* * *\n“Metal is your life,” Tellingdwar said from the front of the hut, moving into\nthe final parts of the evening recitation.\nWaxillium knelt in meditation, listening to the words. Around him, rows\nof peaceful Terris were similarly bowed in reverence, offering praise to\nPreservation, the ancient god of their faith.\n“Metal is your soul,” Tellingdwar said.\nSo much was perfect in this quiet world. Why did Waxillium sometimes\nfeel like he was dragging dirt in solely by being here? That they were all part\nof one big white canvas, and he a smudge at the bottom?\n“You preserve us,” Tellingdwar said, “and so we will be yours.”\nA bullet, Waxillium thought, the bit of metal still clenched in his palm."

What does it mean? It seemed an\nodd symbol.\nRecitation complete, the youths, children, and adults alike rose and\nstretched. There was some jovial interaction, but curfew had nearly arrived,\nwhich meant that the younger set had to be on their way to their homes—or\nin Waxillium’s case, the dormitories. He remained kneeling anyway.\nTellingdwar started gathering up the mats people had used for kneeling.\nHe kept his head shaved; his robes were bright yellows and oranges. Arms\nladen with mats, he paused as he noticed Waxillium hadn’t left with the\nothers. “Asinthew? Are you well?”\nWaxillium nodded tiredly, climbing to his feet, legs numb from kneeling\nso long. He plodded toward the exit, where he paused. “Tellingdwar?”\n“Yes, Asinthew?”\n“Has there ever been a violent crime in the Village?”\nThe short steward froze, his grip tightening on the load of mats. “What\nmakes you ask?”\n“Curiosity.”\n“You needn’t worry. That was long ago.”\n“What was long ago?”\nTellingdwar retrieved the remaining mats, moving more quickly than\nbefore. Perhaps someone else would have avoided the question, but\nTellingdwar was as candid as they came. A classic Terris virtue—in his eyes,\navoiding a question would be as bad as lying.\n“I’m not surprised they’re still whispering about it,” Tellingdwar said.\n“Fifteen years can’t wash away that blood, I suppose. The rumors are wrong,\nhowever. Only one person was killed. A woman, by her husband’s hand.\nBoth Terris.” He hesitated. “I knew them.”\n“How did he kill her?”\n“Must you know this?”\n“Well, the rumors…”\nTellingdwar sighed. “A gun. An outsider weapon. We don’t know where\nhe got it.” Tellingdwar shook his head, dropping the mats into a stack at the\nside of the room. “I guess we shouldn’t be surprised. Men are the same\neverywhere, Asinthew. You must remember this. Do not think yourself better\nthan another because you wear the robe.”\nTrust Tellingdwar to turn any conversation into a lesson. Waxillium\nnodded to him and slipped out into the night. The sky rumbled above,\nforetelling rain, but there was no mist yet.\nMen are the same everywhere, Asinthew.… What was the purpose, then, of\neverything they taught in here? If it couldn’t prevent men from acting like\nmonsters?\nHe reached the boys’ dorm, which was quiet. It was just after curfew, and\nWaxillium had to bow his head to the dormmaster in apology before rushing\ndown the hallway and into his room on the ground floor. Waxillium’s father\nhad insisted he be given a room to himself, because of his noble heritage.\nThat had only served to set him apart from the others.\nHe shucked off his robe and threw open his wardrobe.

Rain began to patter against his window as he threw on some\ntrousers and a buttoning shirt, which he found more comfortable than those\nrusting robes. He trimmed his lamp and sat back on his cot, opening a book\nfor some evening reading.\nOutside, the sky rumbled like an empty stomach. Waxillium tried to read\nfor a few minutes, then tossed the book aside—nearly knocking over his\nlamp—and threw himself to his feet. He walked to the window, watching the\nwater stream down. It fell in patches and columns, because of the thick\ncanopy of leaves. He reached over and extinguished the lamp.\nHe stared at the rain, thoughts tumbling in his head. He’d have to make a\ndecision soon. The agreement between his grandmother and his parents\nrequired Waxillium to spend one year in the Village, and only a month of\nthat remained. After that, it would be his choice whether to stay or to leave.\nWhat awaited him outside? White tablecloths, posturing people with nasal\naccents, and politics.\nWhat awaited him here? Quiet rooms, meditation, and boredom.\nA life he detested or a life of mind-numbing repetition.

Forch glanced toward\nthe dormitory, but then continued on into the night.\nSo they were back. That was faster than he’d expected. What was Telsin’s\nplan for getting into the dorms? Slip in through the windows, then claim\nthey’d come home before curfew and the dormmaster just hadn’t seen them?\nWaxillium waited, wondering if he’d spot the three girls as well, but saw\nnothing. Only Forch, disappearing into the shadows. Where was he going?\nAnother fire, Waxillium thought immediately. But Forch wouldn’t do it in\nthis rain, would he?\nWaxillium glanced at the clock ticking quietly on his wall. An hour after\ncurfew. He hadn’t realized he’d spent so much time staring at the rain.\nForch is not my problem, he told himself firmly. He walked back to lie on\nhis bed, but soon found himself pacing instead. Listening to the rain,\nanxious, unable to stop his body from moving.\nCurfew …\nLet the rules become your guide. In them find peace.\nHe stopped beside the window. Then he pushed it open and leaped out,\nbare feet sinking into the wet, rubbery ground. He scrambled forward,\nstreams of water spraying across his head, trickling down the back of his\nshirt. Which way had Forch gone?\nHe took his best guess, passing enormous trees like hewn monoliths, the\nrush of rain and streaming water drowning out all else. A boot print in the\nmud near a tree trunk hinted he was on the right track, but he had to lean\ndown low to see it. Rusts! It was getting dark out here.\nWhere next? Waxillium turned about.

An\nold dormitory, now unoccupied, where the Terris kept extra furniture and\nrugs. That would be a perfect target for arson, right? Plenty of stuff inside to\nburn, and nobody would expect it in this rain.\nBut Grandmother spoke to him, Waxillium thought, scrambling through\nthe rain, feet cold as he kicked up fallen leaves and moss. They’ll know it\nwas him. Didn’t he care? Was he trying to get into trouble?\nWaxillium stepped up to the old dormitory, a three-story mass of\nblackness in the already dark night, showers of water streaming off its eaves.\nWaxillium tested the door, and it was unlocked of course—this was the\nVillage. He slipped inside.\nThere. A pool of water on the floor. Someone had entered here recently.\nHe followed in a crouch, touching the footprints one after another, until he\nreached the stairwell. Up one flight, then another. What was up here? He\nreached the top floor and saw a light ahead. Waxillium crept through a\nhallway with a rug down the center, approaching what turned out to be a\nflickering candle set on a table in a small room cluttered with furniture and\nwith dark, heavy drapes on the walls.\nWaxillium stepped up to the candle. It shivered, frail and alone. Why had\nForch left it here? What was—\nSomething heavy smashed across Waxillium’s back. He gasped in pain,\nthrown forward by the blow, stumbling into a pair of chairs stacked atop one\nanother. Boots thumped on the floor behind him. Waxillium managed to\nthrow himself to the side, rolling to the floor as Forch smashed an old\nwooden post into the chairs, cracking them.\nWaxillium scrambled to his feet, his shoulders throbbing. Forch turned\ntoward him, face all in shadow.\nWaxillium backed away. “Forch! It’s all right. I just want to talk.” He\nwinced as his back hit the wall. “You don’t have to—”\nForch came at him swinging. Waxillium yelped and ducked into the\nhallway. “Help!” he shouted as Forch followed him. “Help!”\nWaxillium had meant to scramble toward the stairs, but he’d gotten turned\naround. Instead he was running away from them. He slammed his shoulder\nagainst the door at the end of the hallway. That would lead to the upper\nmeeting room, if the dormitory here had the same layout as his own. And\nmaybe another set of steps?\nWaxillium pushed through the door and into a brighter room. Old tables\nstacked atop one another surrounded an open space at the center, like an\naudience and a stage.\nThere, in the middle and lit by a dozen candles, a young boy of maybe\nfive lay tied to a wooden plank that stretched between two tables. His shirt\nhad been cut off and lay on the floor. His cries were muffled by a gag, and he\nstruggled weakly against his bonds.\nWaxillium stumbled to a halt, taking in the boy, the line of gleaming"

You know?”\n“You went with the girls,” Waxillium said, “so you’d have an alibi. If your\nroom is found empty, you’ll say you were with them. A lesser infraction to\nhide your true crime. Rusts! My sister and the others don’t know that you\nslipped back, do they? They’re out there drunk, and they won’t even\nremember that you were gone. They’ll swear you were—”\nWaxillium cut off as Forch looked up, eyes reflecting candlelight, face\nexpressionless. He held up a handful of nails.\nThat’s right. Forch is a—\nWaxillium shouted, throwing himself toward a pile of furniture as nails\nzipped from Forch’s hand, Pushed by his Allomancy. They hit like hail,\nsnapping against wooden tables, chair legs, and the floor. A sudden pain\nstruck Wax in the arm as he scuttled backward.\nHe cried out, grabbing his arm as he got behind cover. One of the nails\nhad ripped off a chunk of his flesh near the elbow.\nMetal. He needed metal.\nIt had been months since he’d burned steel. Grandmother wanted him to\nembrace his Terris side. He raised his arms, and found them bare. His\nbracers …\nIn your room, idiot, Waxillium thought. He fished in his trouser pocket.\nHe always used to keep …\nA pouch of metal flakes. He dug it out as he scrambled away from Forch,\nwho threw aside tables and chairs to get to him. In the background, the\ncaptive child whimpered.\nWaxillium’s fingers trembled as he tried to get the packet of metal flakes\nopen, but it suddenly leaped from his fingers and shot across the room. He\nspun on Forch, desperate, just in time to see the man slide a metal bar off a\ntable and toss it.\nWaxillium tried to duck. Too slow. The Steelpushed bar slammed against\nhis chest, throwing him backward. Forch grunted, stumbling. He wasn’t\npracticed with his Allomancy, and hadn’t properly braced himself. His Push\nthrew him backward as much as it tossed Waxillium.\nStill, Waxillium hit the wall with a grunt, and he felt something crack\ninside of him. He gasped, his vision blackening as he dropped to his knees.\nThe room wavered.\nThe pouch. Get the pouch!\nHe searched the floor around him, frantic, barely able to think. He needed\nthat metal! His fingers, bloodied, brushed it. Eager, he snatched the pouch\nand pulled open the cloth top.

The\nbroken bone inside of Waxillium gave, and he screamed, having gotten\nbarely a pinch of metal into his mouth. Forch slapped the pouch out of his\nhand, scattering the flakes, then picked him up.\nThe youth looked bulkier than he should have. Tapping a metalmind. A\nfrenzied part of Waxillium’s brain tried to Push on the man’s bracers, but\nFeruchemical metalminds were infamously difficult to affect with\nAllomancy. His Push wasn’t strong enough.\nForch shoved Waxillium out the open window, dangling him by his neck.\nRain washed over Waxillium, and he struggled for breath. “Please …\nForch…”\nForch dropped him.\nWaxillium fell with the rain.\nThree stories down, through the branches of a maple tree, scattering wet\nleaves.\nSteel burned to life inside of him, spraying blue lines from his chest to\nnearby sources of metal. All above, none below. Nothing to Push on to save\nhimself.\nExcept one bit in his trouser pocket.\nWaxillium Pushed on it, desperate, as he tumbled in the air. It shot through\nhis pocket, down along his leg, cutting a line in the side of his foot before\nbeing propelled down into the ground by his weight. Waxillium jerked in the\nair, slowing as soon as the bit of metal hit the ground.\nHe crashed onto the sodden pathway feet-first, pain jolting up his legs. He\nfell back to the ground, and found himself dazed but alive. His Push had\nsaved him.\nRain fell on his face. He waited, but Forch didn’t come down to finish him\noff. The youth had slammed the shutters, perhaps worried someone would\nsee the light of his candles.\nEvery part of Waxillium ached. Shoulders from the first blow, legs from\nthe fall, chest from the bar—how many ribs had he broken? He lay there in\nthe rain, coughing, before finally rolling over to find the bit of metal that had\nsaved his life. He found it easily by following its Allomantic line, and dug in\nthe mud, pulling out something and holding it up.\nThe constable’s bullet. Rain washed his hand, cleansing the metal. He\ndidn’t even remember stuffing it into his pocket.\nIn a case like this, the fire is often just a harbinger.…\nHe should go get help. But that boy above was already bleeding. The\nknives were out.\nSomething bigger is coming, Elder. Something you’ll all regret.\nSuddenly Waxillium hated Forch. This place was perfect, serene.\nBeautiful. Darkness shouldn’t exist here. If Waxillium was a smudge on the\nwhite canvas, this man was a pit of pure blackness.\nWaxillium shouted, climbing to his feet and throwing himself through the\nback door and into the old building. He climbed two flights in a haze of\nstumbling pain before slamming open the door into the meeting room. Forch\nstood above the weeping child, a bloody knife in his hand. He turned his\nhead slowly, showing Waxillium one eye, half of his face."

He turned his\nhead slowly, showing Waxillium one eye, half of his face.\nWaxillium threw the single bullet up between them, its casing glittering in\ncandlelight, then Pushed with everything he had. Forch turned and Pushed\nback.\nThe reaction was immediate. The bullet stopped in midair, inches from\nForch’s face. Both men were thrown backward, but Forch caught himself on\na group of tables, staying steady. Waxillium was slammed against the wall\nbeside the doorway.\nForch smiled, and his muscles swelled, strength drawn from his\nmetalmind. He pulled his bar from the table of knives and threw it at\nWaxillium, who cried out, Pushing against it to stop it from smashing him.\nHe wasn’t strong enough. Forch continued to Push, and Waxillium had so\nlittle steel. The bar slipped forward in the air, pressing against Waxillium’s\nchest, pushing him against the wall.\nTime froze. One bullet hanging just before Forch, their main fight over the\nbar which—bit by bit—crushed Waxillium. His chest flared in pain, and a\nscream slipped from his lips.\nHe was going to die here.\nI just want to do what is right. Why is that so hard?\nForch stepped forward, grinning.\nWaxillium’s eyes fixed on that bullet, glittering golden. He couldn’t\nbreathe. But that bullet …\nMetal is your life.\nA bullet. Three parts metal. The tip.\nMetal is your soul.\nThe casing.\nYou preserve us …\nAnd the knob at the back. The spot the hammer would hit.\nIn that moment, to Waxillium’s eyes, they split into three lines, three parts.\nHe took them all in at once. And then, as the bar crushed him, he let go of\ntwo bits.\nAnd shoved on that knob at the back.\nThe bullet exploded. The casing flipped backward into the air, Pushed by\nForch’s Allomancy, while the bullet itself zipped forward, untouched, before\ndrilling into Forch’s skull.\nWaxillium dropped to the ground, the bar propelled away. He collapsed in\na heap, gasping for breath, rainwater streaming from his face to the wooden\nfloor.\nIn a daze, he heard voices below. People finally responding to the shouts,\nthen the sound of gunfire. He forced himself to his feet and limped through\nthe room, ignoring the voices of Terrismen and women who climbed the\nsteps. He reached the child and ripped off the bonds, freeing him. Instead of\nrunning in fear, however, the little boy grabbed Waxillium’s leg and held on\ntight, weeping.\nPeople poured into the room. Waxillium leaned down, picking up the\nbullet casing off the wet floor, then stood up straight and faced them.\nTellingdwar. His grandmother. The elders. He registered their horror, and\nknew in that moment they would hate him because he had brought violence\ninto their village.\nHate him because he had been right.\nHe stood beside Forch’s corpse and closed one hand around the bullet\ncasing, resting his other on the head of the trembling child."

A\nwall of mist fell in around the man who had kicked it open, outlining his\nsilhouette: a mistcoat, tassels flaring from motion, a combat shotgun held up\nto the side.\n“Fire!” Migs cried.\nThe lads unloaded. Eight men, armed to their teeth, fired at the shadowy\nfigure from behind their barricade inside the old pub. Bullets swarmed like\ninsects, but parted around this man in the long coat. They pelted the wall,\ndrilling holes in the door and splintering the doorframe. They cut trails\nthrough the encroaching mist, but the lawman, all black in the gloom, didn’t\nso much as flinch.\nMigs fired shot after shot, despairing. He emptied one pistol, then a\nsecond, then shouldered his rifle and fired as quickly as he could cock it.\nHow had they gotten here? Rusts, how had this happened? It wasn’t\nsupposed to have gone like this.\n“It’s useless!” one of the lads cried. “He’s gonna kill us all, Migs!”\n“Why’re you just standin’ there?” Migs shouted at the lawman. “Be at it\nalready!” He fired twice more. “What’s wrong with you?”\n“Maybe he’s distracting us,” one of the lads said, “so his pal can sneak up\nbehind us.”\n“Hey, that’s…” Migs hesitated, looking toward the one who had spoken.\nRound face. Simple, round coachman’s hat, like a bowler, but flatter on top.\nWho was that man again? He counted his crew.\nNine?\nThe lad next to Migs smiled, tipped his hat, then decked him in the face.\nIt was over blurringly quick. The fellow in the coachman’s cap laid out\nSlink and Guillian in an eyeblink. Then suddenly he was closer to the two on\nthe far side, slapping them down with a pair of dueling canes. As Migs\nturned—fumbling for the gun he’d dropped—the lawman leaped over the\nbarricade with tassels flying and kicked Drawers in the chin. The lawman\nspun, leveling his shotgun at the men on the other side.\nThey dropped their guns. Migs knelt, sweating, beside an overturned\ntable. He waited for the gunshots.\nThey didn’t come.\n“Ready for you, Captain!” the lawman shouted. A pile of constables\nrushed through the doorway, disturbing the mists. Outside, morning light\nwas starting to dispel those anyway. Rusts. Had they really holed up in here\nall night?\nThe lawman swung his gun down toward Migs. “You might want to drop\nthat gun, friend,” he said in a conversational tone.\nMigs hesitated. “Just shoot me, lawman. I’m in too deep.”\n“You shot two constables,” the man said, finger on the trigger. “But they’ll"

Drop the gun.”\nThey’d called those same words before, from outside. This time, Migs\nfound himself believing them. “Why?” he asked. “You coulda killed us all\nwithout breaking a sweat. Why?”\n“Because,” the lawman said, “frankly, you’re not worth killing.” He\nsmiled in a friendly-type way. “I’ve got enough on my conscience already.\nDrop the gun. We’ll get this sorted out.”\nMigs dropped the gun and stood, then waved down Drawers, who was\nclimbing up with his gun in hand. The man reluctantly dropped his weapon\ntoo.\nThe lawman turned, cresting the barricade with an Allomantic leap, and\nslammed his shortened shotgun into a holster on his leg. The younger man in\nthe coachman’s hat joined him, whistling softly. He appeared to have swiped\nGuillian’s favorite knife; the ivory hilt was sticking out of his pocket.\n“They’re yours, Captain,” the lawman said.\n“Not staying for the booking, Wax?” the constable captain asked, turning.\n“Unfortunately, no,” the lawman said. “I have to get to a wedding.”\n“Whose?”\n“Mine, I’m afraid.”\n“You came on a raid the morning of your wedding?” the captain asked.\nThe lawman, Waxillium Ladrian, stopped in the doorway. “In my defense,\nit wasn’t my idea.” He nodded one more time to the assembled constables\nand gang members, then strode out into the mists.\nPART ONE\n1\nWaxillium Ladrian hurried down the steps outside the bar-turned-hideout,\npassing constables in brown who bustled this way and that. The mists were\nalready evaporating, dawn heralding the end of their vigil. He checked his\narm, where a bullet had ripped a sizable hole through the cuff of his shirt and\nout the side of his jacket. He’d felt that one pass.\n“Oi,” Wayne said, hustling up beside him. “A good plan that one was,\neh?”\n“It was the same plan you always have,” Wax said. “The one where I get\nto be the decoy.”\n“Ain’t my fault people like to shoot at you, mate,” Wayne said as they\nreached the coach. “You should be happy; you’re usin’ your talents, like me\ngranners always said a man should do.”\n“I’d rather not have ‘shootability’ be my talent.”\n“Well, you gotta use what you have,” Wayne said, leaning against the side\nof the carriage as Cob the coachman opened the door for Wax. “Same reason\nI always have bits of rat in my stew.”\nWax looked into the carriage, with its fine cushions and rich upholstery,\nbut didn’t climb in.\n“You gonna be all right?” Wayne asked.\n“Of course I am,” Wax said. “This is my second marriage.

The coachman cleared his\nthroat, still standing and holding the door open for him.\n“Right pretty noose, that is,” Wayne noted.\n“Don’t be melodramatic,” Wax said, leaning to climb in.\n“Lord Ladrian!” a voice called from behind.\nWax glanced over his shoulder, noting a tall man in a dark brown suit and\nbow tie pushing between a pair of constables. “Lord Ladrian,” the man said,\n“could I have a moment, please?”\n“Take them all,” Wax said. “But do it without me.”\n“But—”\n“I’ll meet you there,” Wax said, nodding to Wayne. He dropped a spent\nbullet shell, then Pushed himself into the air. Why waste time on a carriage?\nSteel at a comfortable burn inside his stomach, he shoved on a nearby\nelectric streetlight—still shining, though morning had arrived—and soared\nhigher into the air. Elendel spread before him, a soot-stained marvel of a city,\nleaking smoke from a hundred thousand different homes and factories. Wax\nshoved off the steel frame of a half-finished building nearby, then sent\nhimself in a series of leaping bounds across the Fourth Octant.\nHe passed over a field of carriages for hire, rows of vehicles waiting\nquietly in ranks, early morning workers looking up at him as he passed. One\npointed; perhaps the mistcoat had drawn his attention. Coinshot couriers\nweren’t an uncommon sight in Elendel, and men soaring through the air\nwere rarely a point of interest.\nA few more leaps took him over a series of warehouses in huddled rows.\nWax thrilled in each jump. It was amazing how this could still feel so\nwonderful to him. The breeze in his face, the little moment of weightlessness\nwhen he hung at the very top of an arc.\nAll too soon, however, both gravity and duty reasserted themselves. He\nleft the industrial district and crossed finer roadways, paved with pitch and\ngravel to create a smoother surface than cobbles for all those blasted\nmotorcars. He spotted the Survivorist church easily, with its large glass and\nsteel dome. Back in Weathering a simple wooden chapel had been sufficient,\nbut that wasn’t nearly grand enough for Elendel.\nThe design was to allow those who worshipped full view of the mists at\nnight. Wax figured if they wanted to see the mists, they’d do better just\nstepping outside. But perhaps he was being cynical. After all, the dome—\nwhich was made of segments of glass between steel supports, making it look\nlike the sections of an orange—was able to open inward and let the mist pour\ndown for special occasions.\nHe landed on a rooftop water tower across from the church.

Perhaps when\nit had been built, the church’s dome had been tall enough to overshadow the\nsurrounding buildings. It would have provided a nice profile. Now, buildings\nwere rising taller and taller, and the church was dwarfed by its surroundings.\nWayne would find a metaphor in that. Probably a crude one.\nHe perched on the water tower, looming over the church. So he was here,\nfinally. He felt his eye begin to twitch, and an ache rose within him.\nI think I loved you even on that day. So ridiculous, but so earnest.…\nSix months ago, he’d pulled the trigger. He could still hear the gunshot.\nStanding up, he pulled himself together. He’d healed this wound once. He\ncould do so again.

He leaped off the water tower, then slowed\nby dropping and Pushing on a shell casing.\nHe hit the street and strode past a long line of carriages.

His stress, his nervousness, melted away a\nlittle.\nSteris looked up as soon as he entered, then hurried to his side. “And?”\n“I didn’t get killed,” he said, “so there’s that.”\nShe glanced at the clock. “You’re late,” she said, “but not very late.”\n“I’m … sorry?” She’d insisted he go on the raid. She’d planned for it, in\nfact. Such was life with Steris.\n“I’m sure you did your best,” Steris said, taking his arm. She was warm,\nand even trembling. Steris might be reserved, but unlike what some\nassumed, she wasn’t emotionless.\n“The raid?” she asked.\n“Went well. No casualties.” He walked with her to a side chamber, where\nDrewton—his valet—waited beside a table spread with Wax’s white\nwedding suit. “You realize that by going on a raid on the morning of my\nwedding, I’ll only reinforce this image that society has of me.”\n“Which image?”\n“That of a ruffian,” he said, taking off his mistcoat and handing it to\nDrewton. “A barely civilized lout from the Roughs who curses in church and\ngoes to parties armed.”\nShe glanced at his shotgun, which he’d tossed onto the sofa. “You enjoy\nplaying with people’s perceptions of you, don’t you? You seek to make them\nuncomfortable, so they’ll be off balance.”\n“It’s one of the simple joys I have left, Steris.” He smiled as Drewton\nunbuttoned his waistcoat. Then he pulled off both that and his shirt, leaving\nhim bare-chested."

He slipped them\non. He hadn’t worn white much since returning from the Roughs. It was\nharder to keep clean out there, which had made it worth wearing. “I figured\nthis would work.”\n“I wanted planned disturbances, Lord Waxillium,” Steris snapped. “It’s\nnot upsetting if it’s understood, prepared for, and controlled. Wayne is rather\nthe opposite of those things, wouldn’t you say?”\nWax did up his buttons and Drewton took his shirt off the hanger nearby.\nSteris turned around immediately upon hearing the sound, arms still folded,\nand didn’t miss a beat—refusing to acknowledge that she’d been\nembarrassed. “I’m glad I had copies made.”\n“You made copies of our wedding pendants?”\n“Yes.” She chewed her lip a moment. “Six sets.”\n“Six?”\n“The other four didn’t arrive in time.”\nWax grinned, doing up the buttons on his shirt, then letting his valet\nhandle the cuffs. “You’re one of a kind, Steris.”\n“Technically, so is Wayne—and actually so was Ruin, for that matter.

So the only thing you do by preparing for\ndisturbances is ensure that something else is going to go wrong.”\n“That’s a rather fatalistic viewpoint.”\n“Living in the Roughs does that to a fellow.” He eyed her, standing\nresplendent in her dress, arms crossed, tapping her left arm with her right\nindex finger.\n“I just … feel better when I try,” Steris finally said. “It’s like, if everything\ngoes wrong, at least I tried. Does that make any sense?”\n“As a matter of fact, I think it does.”\nDrewton stepped back, satisfied. The suit came with a very nice black\ncravat and vest. Traditional, which Wax preferred. Bow ties were for\nsalesmen. He slid on the jacket, tails brushing the backs of his legs. Then,\nafter a moment’s hesitation, he strapped on his gunbelt and slid Vindication\ninto her holster. He’d worn a gun to his last wedding, so why not this one?\nSteris nodded in approval.\nShoes went last. A new pair. They’d be hideously uncomfortable. “Are we\nlate enough yet?” he asked Steris.\nShe checked the clock in the corner. “I planned for us to go in two minutes\nfrom now.”\n“Ah, delightful,” he said, taking her arm. “That means we can be\nspontaneous and arrive early. Well, late-early.”\nShe clung to his arm, letting him steer her down the side chamber toward\nthe entrance to the dome, and the church proper. Drewton followed behind.\n“Are you … certain you wish to proceed?” Steris asked, stopping him\nbefore they entered the walkway to the dome.\n“Having second thoughts?”\n“Absolutely not,” Steris said immediately. “This union is quite beneficial\nto my house and status.” She took Wax’s left hand in both of hers. “But Lord\nWaxillium,” she said softly, “I don’t want you to feel trapped, particularly\nafter what happened to you earlier this year. If you wish to back out, I will\naccept it as your will.”\nThe way she clutched his hand as she said those words sent a very\ndifferent message. But she didn’t seem to notice. Looking at her, Wax found\nhimself wondering. When he’d first agreed to the marriage, he’d done so out\nof duty to his house.\nNow, he felt his emotions shifting. The way she’d been there for him these\nlast months as he’d grieved … The way she looked at him right now …\nRust and Ruin. He was actually fond of Steris. It wasn’t love, but he\ndoubted he would love again. This would do.\n“No, Steris,” he said. “I would not back out. That … wouldn’t be fair to\nyour house, and the money you have spent.”\n“The money doesn’t—”\n“It’s all right,” Wax said, giving her hand a little squeeze. “I have\nrecovered enough from my ordeal. I’m strong enough to do this.”\nSteris opened her mouth to reply, but a knock at the door heralded Marasi\nsticking her head in to check on them.

With dark hair and softer, rounder\nfeatures than Steris, Marasi wore bright red lipstick and a progressive lady’s\nattire—a pleated skirt, with a tight buttoned jacket.\n“Finally,” she said. “Crowd is getting fidgety. Wax, there’s a man here\nwanting to see you. I’ve been trying to send him away, but … well…”\nShe came into the room and held the door open, revealing the same\nslender man in the brown suit and bow tie from before, standing with the ash\ngirls in the antechamber that led to the dome proper.\n“You,” Wax said. “How did you get here before Wayne?”\n“I don’t believe your friend is coming,” the man said. He stepped in\nbeside Marasi and nodded to her, then closed the doors, shutting out the ash\ngirls. He turned and tossed Wax a wadded-up ball of paper.\nWhen Wax caught it, it clinked. Unfolding it revealed the two wedding\npendants. Scrawled on the paper were the words: Gonna go get smashed till\nI can’t piss straight. Happy weddings ’n stuff.\n“Such beautiful imagery,” Steris observed, taking Wax’s wedding pendant\nin a white-gloved hand as Marasi looked over his shoulder to read the note.\n“At least he didn’t forget these.”\n“Thank you,” Wax said to the man in brown, “but as you can see, I’m\nquite busy getting married. Whatever you need from me can—”\nThe man’s face turned translucent, displaying the bones of his skull and\nspine beneath.\nSteris stiffened. “Holy One,” she whispered.\n“Holy pain,” Wax said. “Tell Harmony to get someone else this time. I’m\nbusy.”\n“Tell … Harmony…” Steris mumbled, her eyes wide.\n“Unfortunately, this is part of the problem,” the man in brown said, his\nskin returning to normal. “Harmony has been distracted as of late.”\n“How can God be distracted?” Marasi asked.\n“We’re not sure, but it has us worried. I need you, Waxillium Ladrian. I\nhave a job you’ll find of interest. I realize you’re off to the ceremony, but\nafterward, if I could have a moment of your time…”\n“No,” Wax said.\n“But—”\n“No.”\nWax pulled Steris by the arm, shoving open the doors, striding past\nMarasi, leaving the kandra. It had been six months since those creatures had\nmanipulated him, played him, and lied to him. The result? A dead woman in\nhis arms.\nBastards.\n“Was that really one of the Faceless Immortals?” Steris said, looking over\nher shoulder.\n“Yes, and for obvious reasons I want nothing to do with them.”\n“Peace,” she said, holding his arm. “Do you need a moment?”\n“No.”\n“You’re sure?”\nWax stopped in place. She waited, and he breathed in and out, banishing\nfrom his mind that awful, awful scene when he’d knelt on a bridge alone,\nholding Lessie. A woman he realized he’d never actually known.\n“I’m all right,” he said to Steris through clenched teeth. “But God should\nhave known not to come for me. Particularly not today.”"

Particularly not today.”\n“Your life is … decidedly odd, Lord Waxillium.”\n“I know,” he said, moving again, stepping with her beside the last door\nbefore they entered the dome. “Ready?”\n“Yes, thank you.” Was she … teary-eyed? It was an expression of emotion\nhe’d never seen from her.\n“Are you all right?” he asked.\n“Yes,” she said. “Forgive me. It’s just … more wonderful than I’d\nimagined.”\nThey pushed open the doors, revealing the glistening dome, sunlight\nstreaming through it and upon the waiting crowd. Acquaintances. Distant\nfamily members. Seamstresses and forgeworkers from his house. Wax\nsought out Wayne, and was surprised when he didn’t find the man, despite\nthe note. He was the only real family Wax had.\nThe ash girls scampered out, sprinkling small handfuls of ash on the\ncarpeted walkway that ringed the perimeter of the dome. Wax and Steris\nstarted forward in a stately walk, presenting themselves for those in\nattendance. There was no music at a Survivorist ceremony, but a few\ncrackling braziers with green leaves on top let smoke trail upward to\nrepresent the mist.\nSmoke ascends while ash falls, he thought, remembering the priest’s\nwords from his youth, back when he’d attended Survivorist ceremonies.\nThey walked all the way around the crowd. At least Steris’s family had made\na decent showing, her father included—the red-faced man gave Waxillium\nan enthusiastic fist-raise as they passed.\nWax found himself smiling. This was what Lessie had wanted. They’d\njoked time and time again about their simple Pathian ceremony, finalized on\nhorseback to escape a mob. She said that someday, she’d make him do it\nproper.\nSparkling crystal. A hushed crowd. Footsteps on scrunching carpet\ndappled with grey ash. His smile widened, and he looked to the side.\nBut of course, the wrong woman was there.\nHe almost stumbled. Idiot man, he thought. Focus. This day was\nimportant to Steris; the least he could do was not ruin it. Or rather, not ruin it\nin a way she hadn’t expected. Whatever that meant.\nUnfortunately, as they walked the remaining distance around the rotunda,\nhis discomfort increased. He felt nauseous. Sweaty. Sick, like the feeling he\nhad gotten the few times he had been forced to run from a killer and leave\ninnocents in danger.\nIt all forced him, finally, to acknowledge a difficult fact. He wasn’t ready.\nIt wasn’t Steris, it wasn’t the setting. He just wasn’t ready for this.\nThis marriage meant letting go of Lessie.\nBut he was trapped, and he had to be strong. He set his jaw and stepped\nwith Steris onto the dais, where the priest stood between two stands topped\nwith crystal vases of Marewill flowers. The ceremony was drawn from\nancient Larsta beliefs, from Harmony’s Beliefs Reborn, a volume in the\nWords of Founding.\nThe priest spoke the words, but Wax couldn’t listen. All was numbness to"

All was numbness to\nhim, teeth clenched, eyes straight ahead, muscles tense. They’d found a\npriest murdered in this very church. Killed by Lessie as she went mad.\nCouldn’t they have done something for her, instead of setting him on the\nhunt? Couldn’t they have told him?\nStrength. He would not flee. He would not be a coward.\nHe held Steris’s hands, but couldn’t look at her. Instead, he turned his face\nupward to look out the glass dome toward the sky. Most of it was crowded\nout by the buildings. Skyscrapers on two sides, windows glistening in the\nmorning sun. That water tower certainly did block the view, though as he\nwatched, it shifted.…\nShifted?\nWax watched in horror as the legs under the enormous metal cylinder\nbent, as if to kneel, ponderously tipping their burden on its side. The top of\nthe thing sheared off, spilling tons of water in a foaming wave.\nHe yanked Steris to him, arm firmly around her waist, then ripped off the\nsecond button down on his waistcoat and dropped it. He Pushed against this\nsingle metal button, launching himself and Steris away from the dais as the\npriest yelped in surprise.\nWater crashed against the dome, which strained for the briefest of seconds\nbefore a section of it snapped open, hinges giving way inward to the water.\n2\n“Are you certain you’re all right, my lord?” Wax asked, helping Lord\nDrapen, constable-general of the Sixth Octant, down the steps toward his\ncarriage. Water trickled beside them in little streams, joining a small river in\nthe gutters.\n“Ruined my best pistol, you realize,” Drapen said. “I’ll have to send the\nthing to be cleaned and oiled!”\n“Bill me the expense, my lord,” Wax said, ignoring the fact that a good\npistol would hardly be ruined by a little—or, well, a lot of—water. Wax\nturned the aging gentleman over to his coachman, sharing a resigned look,\nbefore turning and climbing back up the steps into the church. The carpet\nsquished when he stepped on it. Or maybe that was his shoes.\nHe passed the priest bickering with the Erikell insurance assessor—come\nto do an initial report for when the church demanded payment on their policy\n—and entered the main dome. The one open section of glass still swung on\nits hinges up above, and the tipped water tower—its legs on the other side\nhad kept it from crashing down completely—still blocked out much of the\nsky.\nHe passed overturned benches, discarded Marewill petals, and general\nrefuse. Water dripped, the room’s only sound other than the echoing voice of\nthe priest. Wax squished his way up to the dais. Steris sat on its edge, wet\ndress plastered to her body, strands of hair that had escaped from her\nwedding braids sticking to the sides of her face. She sat with arms crossed\non her knees, staring at the floor.\nWax sat down next to her. “So, next time a flood is dumped on our heads,"

She sat with arms crossed\non her knees, staring at the floor.\nWax sat down next to her. “So, next time a flood is dumped on our heads,\nI’ll try to remember that jumping upward is a bad idea.” He pulled his\nhandkerchief from his pocket and squeezed it out.\n“You tried to get us backward too. It merely wasn’t fast enough, Lord\nWaxillium.”\nHe grunted. “Looks like simple structural failure. If it was instead some\nkind of assassination attempt … well, it was an incompetent one. There\nwasn’t enough water in there to be truly dangerous. The worst injury was to\nLord Steming, who fell and knocked his head when scrambling off his seat.”\n“No more than an accident then,” Steris said. She flopped backward onto\nthe dais, the carpet letting out a soft squish.\n“I’m sorry.”\n“It’s not your fault.” She sighed. “Do you ever wonder if perhaps the\ncosmere is out to overwhelm you, Lord Waxillium?”\n“The cosmere? You mean Harmony?”\n“No, not Him,” Steris said. “Just cosmic chance rolling the dice anytime I\npass, and always hitting all ones. There seems to be a poetry to it all.” She\nclosed her eyes. “Of course the wedding would fall apart. Several tons of\nwater falling through the roof? Why wouldn’t I have seen that? It’s so utterly\noutlandish it had to happen. At least the priest didn’t get murdered this\ntime.”\n“Steris,” Wax said, resting a hand on her arm. “We’ll fix this. It will be all\nright.”\nShe opened her eyes, looking toward him. “Thank you, Lord Waxillium.”\n“For what, exactly?” he asked.\n“For being nice. For being willing to subject yourself to, well, me. I\nunderstand that it is not a pleasant concept.”\n“Steris…”\n“Do not think me self-deprecating, Lord Waxillium,” she said, sitting up\nand taking a deep breath, “and please do not assume I’m being morose. I am\nwhat I am, and I accept it. But I am under no illusions as to how my\ncompany is regarded. Thank you. For not making me feel as others have.”\nHe hesitated. How did one respond to something like that? “It’s not as you\nsay, Steris. I think you’re delightful.”\n“And the fact that you were gritting your teeth as the ceremony started,\nhands gripping as tightly as a man dangling for his life from the side of a\nbridge?”\n“I…”\n“Are you saddened at the fact that our wedding is delayed? Can you truly\nsay it, and be honest as a lawman, Lord Waxillium?”\nDamn. He floundered. He knew a few simple words could defuse or\nsidestep the question, but he couldn’t find them, despite searching for what\nwas an awkwardly long time—until saying anything would have sounded\ncondescending.\n“Perhaps,” he said, smiling, “I’ll just have to try something to relax me\nnext time we attempt this.”\n“I doubt going to the ceremony drunk would be productive.”\n“I didn’t say I’d drink. Perhaps some Terris meditation beforehand.”\nShe eyed him. “You’re still willing to move forward?”"

Perhaps some Terris meditation beforehand.”\nShe eyed him. “You’re still willing to move forward?”\n“Of course.” As long as it didn’t have to be today. “I assume you have a\nbackup dress?”\n“Two,” she admitted, letting him help her to her feet. “And I did reserve\nanother date for a wedding two months from now. Different church—in case\nthis one exploded.”\nHe grunted. “You sound like Wayne.”\n“Well, things do tend to explode around you, Lord Waxillium.” She\nlooked up at the dome. “Considering that, getting drenched must be rather\nnovel.”\n* * *\nMarasi trailed around the outside of the flooded church, hands clasped\nbehind her back, notebook a familiar weight in her jacket pocket. A few\nconstables—all corporals—stood about looking as if they were in charge.\nThat sort of thing was important in a crisis; statistics showed that if a\nuniformed authority figure was nearby, people were less likely to panic.\nOf course, there was also a smaller percentage who were more likely to\npanic if an authority figure was nearby. Because people were people, and if\nthere was one thing you could count on, it was that some of them would be\nweird. Or rather that all of them would be weird when circumstances\nhappened to align with their own individual brand of insanity.\nThat said, today she hunted a very special kind of insane. She’d tried the\nnearby pubs first, but that was too obvious. Next she checked the gutters, one\nsoup kitchen, and—against her better judgment—a purveyor of “novelties.”\nNo luck, though her backside did get three separate compliments, so there\nwas that.\nFinally, running out of ideas, she went to check if he’d decided to steal the\nforks from the wedding breakfast. There, in a dining hall across the street\nfrom the church, she found Wayne in the kitchens wearing a white jacket and\na chef’s hat. He was scolding several assistant cooks as they furiously\ndecorated tarts with fruit glaze.\nMarasi leaned against the doorway and watched, tapping her notebook\nwith her pencil. Wayne sounded utterly unlike himself, instead using a sharp,\nnasal voice with an accent she couldn’t quite place. Easterner, perhaps?\nSome of the outer cities there had thick accents.\nThe assistant cooks didn’t question him. They jumped at what he said,\nbearing his condemnation as he tasted a chilled soup and swore at their\nincompetence. If he noticed Marasi, he didn’t show it, instead wiping his\nhands on a cloth and demanding to see the produce the delivery boys had\nbrought that morning.\nEventually, Marasi strolled into the kitchen, dodging a short assistant chef\nbearing a pot almost as big as she was, and stepped up to Wayne.\n“I’ve seen crisper lettuce in the garbage heap!” he was saying to a\ncringing delivery boy. “And you call these grapes? These are so overripe,\nthey’re practically fermenting! And—oh, ’ello, Marasi.” He said the last line\nin his normal, jovial voice.\nThe delivery boy scrambled away.\n“What are you doing?” Marasi asked.\n“Makin’ soup,” Wayne said, holding up a wooden spoon to show her."

Shoo, shoo, go!”\nThey scampered away, leaving him grinning.\n“You do realize the wedding breakfast is canceled,” Marasi said, leaning\nback against a table.\n“Sure do.”\n“So why…”\nShe trailed off as he stuffed an entire tart in his mouth and grinned.\n“Hadda make sure they didn’t welch on their promif an’ not make anyfing to\neat,” he said around chewing, crumbs cascading from his lips. “We paid for\nthis stuff. Well, Wax did. ’Sides, wedding being canceled is no reason not to\ncelebrate, right?”\n“Depends on what you’re celebrating,” Marasi said, flipping open her\nnotebook. “Bolts securing the water tower in place were definitely loosened.\nRoad below was conspicuously empty, some ruffians—from another octant\nentirely, I might add—having stopped traffic by starting a fistfight in the\nmiddle of the rusting street.”\nWayne grunted, searching in a cupboard. “Hate that little notebook of\nyours sometimes.”\nMarasi groaned, closing her eyes. “Someone could have been hurt,\nWayne.”\n“Now, that ain’t right at all. Someone was hurt. That fat fellow what has\nno hair.”\nShe massaged her temples. “You realize I’m a constable now, Wayne. I\ncan’t turn a blind eye toward wanton property damage.”\n“Ah, ’s not so bad,” Wayne said, still rummaging. “Wax’ll pay for it.”\n“And if someone had been hurt? Seriously, I mean?”\nWayne kept searching. “The lads got a little carried away. ‘See that the\nchurch is flooded,’ I told them. Meant for the priest to open the place in the\nmorning and find his plumbing had gotten a little case of the ‘being all\nbusted up and leaking all over the rusting place.’ But the lads, they got a\nlittle excited is all.”\n“The ‘lads’?”\n“Just some friends.”\n“Saboteurs.”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “You think they could pronounce that?”\n“Wayne…”\n“I slapped ’em around already, Marasi,” Wayne said. “Promise I did.”\n“He’s going to figure it out,” Marasi said. “What will you do then?”\n“Nah, you’re wrong,” Wayne said, finally coming out of the cupboard\nwith a large glass jug. “Wax has a blind spot for things like this. In the back\nof his noggin, he’ll be relieved that I stopped the wedding. He’ll figure it was\nme, deep in his subcontinence, and will pay for the damages—no matter\nwhat the assessor says.

A fellow\nhas to get creative.”\n“I’m sure we could find some wine around—”\nHe took a swig.\n“Never mind,” Marasi said.\nHe lowered the jug and pulled off his chef’s hat, tossing it onto the\ncounter. “What’re you so uptight for today, anyway? I figured you’d be\nwhooping for joy and runnin’ around the street pickin’ flowers and stuff.\nHe’s not marrying her. Not yet, anyway. You still got a chance.”\n“I don’t want a chance, Wayne. He’s made his decision.”\n“Now, what kinda talk is that?” he demanded. “You’ve given up? Is that\nhow the Ascendant Warrior was? Huh?”\n“No, in fact,” Marasi said. “She walked up to the man she wanted, slapped\nthe book out of his hand, and kissed him.”\n“See, there’s how it is!”\n“Though the Ascendant Warrior also went on and murdered the woman\nElend was planning to marry.”\n“What, really?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Gruesome,” Wayne said in an approving tone, then took another swig of\nsherry.\n“That’s not the half of it,” Marasi said, leaning back on the counter, hands\nbehind her. “You want gruesome? She also supposedly ripped out the Lord\nRuler’s insides. I’ve seen it depicted in several illuminated manuscripts.”\n“Kind of graphic for a religious-type story.”\n“Actually, they’re all like that. I think they have to put in lots of exciting\nbits to make people read the rest.”\n“Huh.” He seemed disbelieving.\n“Wayne, haven’t you ever read any religious texts?”\n“Sure I have.”\n“Really?”\n“Yeah, lots of the things I read have religious texts in them. ‘Damn.’\n‘Hell.’ ‘Flatulent, arse-licking git.’”\nShe gave him a flat stare.\n“That last one is in the Testimony of Hammond. Promise. Least, all the\nletters are.” Another swig. Wayne could outdrink anyone she knew. Of\ncourse, that was mostly because he could tap his metalmind, heal himself,\nand burn away the alcohol’s effects in an eyeblink—then start over.\n“Here now,” he continued, “that’s what you’ve gotta do. Be like the Lady\nMistborn. Get your murderin’ on, see. Don’t back down. He should be yours,\nand you gotta let people know.”\n“My … murderin’ on?”\n“Sure.”\n“Against my sister.”\n“You could be polite about it,” Wayne said. “Like, give her the first stab or\nwhatnot.”\n“No, thank you.”\n“It doesn’t have to be real murderin’, Marasi,” Wayne said, hopping off\nthe counter. “It can be figurative and all.

You think … I should … you know … Ranette…”\n“Wayne, if ever someone should have taken a hint, it was you. Yes. Move\non. Really.”\n“Oh, I took the hint,” he said, taking a swig of sherry. “Just can’t\nremember which jacket I left it in.” He looked down at the jug. “You sure?”\n“She has a girlfriend, Wayne.”\n“’S only a phase,” he mumbled. “One what lasted fifteen years.…” He set\nthe jug down, then sighed and reached into the cupboard from before, taking\nout a bottle of wine.\n“Oh, for Preservation’s sake,” Marasi said. “That was in there all along?”\n“Tastes better iffen you drink something what tastes like dishwater first,”\nWayne said, then pulled the cork out with his teeth, which was kind of\nimpressive, she had to admit. He poured her a cup, then one for himself. “To\nmoving on?” he asked.\n“Sure. To moving on.” She raised her cup, and saw reflected in the wine\nsomeone standing behind her.\nShe gasped, spinning, reaching for her purse. Wayne just raised his cup to\nthe newcomer, who rounded the counter with a slow step. It was the man in\nthe brown suit and bow tie. No, not the man. The kandra.\n“If you’re here to persuade me to persuade him,” Wayne said, “you should\nknow that he doesn’t ever listen to me unless he’s pretty drunk at the time.”\nHe downed the wine. “’S probably why he’s lived so long.”\n“Actually,” the kandra said, “I’m not here for you.” He turned to Marasi,\nthen tipped his head. “My first choice for this endeavor has rejected my\nrequest.

It simply wasn’t what a house lord did.\nWax nodded to Cob and handed him the broadsheet. Cob grinned; he\nloved the things. “Take the rest of the day off,” Wax told him. “I know you\nwere looking forward to the wedding festivities.”\nCob’s grin widened, then he bobbed his head and climbed back onto the\ncoach to see it, and the horses, cared for before leaving. He’d likely spend\nthe day at the races.\nWax sighed, climbing the steps to the mansion. It was one of the finest in\nthe city—luxurious with carved stonework and deep hardwood, with tasteful\nmarble accents. That didn’t stop it from being a prison. It was just a very\nnice one.\nWax didn’t enter. Instead, he stood on the steps for a while before turning\naround and sitting on them. Closing his eyes, he let it all settle on him.\nHe was good at hiding his scars. He’d been shot almost a dozen times\nnow, a few of those wounds quite bad. Out in the Roughs, he’d learned to\npick himself up and keep on going, no matter what happened.\nAt the same time, it felt like things back then had been simple. Not always\neasy, but simple. And some scars continued to ache. Seemed to get worse\nwith time.\nHe rose with a groan, leg stiff, and continued up the steps. Nobody opened\nthe door for him or took his coat as he entered. He maintained a small staff\nin the house, but only what he considered necessary. Too many servants, and\nthey’d hover and worry when he did anything on his own. It was as if the\nidea of him being capable drove them into feeling vestigial.…\nWax frowned, then slipped Vindication from his hip holster and raised her\nbeside his head. He couldn’t say, precisely, what had set him off. Footsteps\nup above, when he’d given the housekeepers the day off. A cup on a side\ntable with a bit of wine in the bottom.\nHe flicked a little vial from his belt and downed the contents: steel flakes\nsuspended in whiskey. The metal burned a familiar warmth inside of him,\nradiating from his stomach, and blue lines sprang into existence around him."

The metal burned a familiar warmth inside of him,\nradiating from his stomach, and blue lines sprang into existence around him.\nThey moved with him as he crept forward, as if he were tied with a thousand\ntiny threads.\nHe leaped and Pushed on the inlays in the marble floor, soaring up\nalongside the stairs to the second-story viewing balcony above the grand\nentryway. He slipped easily over the banister, landing with gun at the ready.\nThe door to his study quivered, then opened.\nWax tiptoed forward.\n“Just a moment, I—” The man in the light brown suit froze as he found\nWax’s gun pressed against his temple.\n“You,” Wax said.\n“I’m quite fond of this skull,” the kandra remarked. “It’s sixth-century\nanteverdant, the head of a metal merchant from Urteau whose grave was\nshifted and protected as a side effect of Harmony’s rebuilding. An antique, if\nyou will. If you make a hole in it, I’ll be rather put out.”\n“I told you I wasn’t interested,” Wax growled.\n“Yes. I took that to heart, Lord Ladrian.”\n“Then why are you here?”\n“Because I was invited,” the kandra said. He reached up and grasped the\nbarrel of Wax’s gun between two fingers, then pushed it gently to the side.\n“We needed a place to converse. Your associate suggested it, as—I’m told—\nthe servants are away.”\n“My associate?” At that point, he heard laughter from ahead. “Wayne.” He\neyed the kandra, then sighed and slipped his gun into its holster. “Which one\nare you? TenSoon, is that you?”\n“Me?” the kandra asked, laughing. “TenSoon? What, do you hear me\npanting?” He chuckled, gesturing for Wax to enter his own study, as if he\nwere doing Wax some grand courtesy. “I am VenDell, of the Sixth. Pleased\nto meet you, Lord Ladrian. If you must shoot me, please do it in the left leg,\nas I’ve no particular fondness for those bones.”\n“I’m not going to shoot you,” Wax said, shoving past the kandra and\nentering the room. The blinds had been drawn and the thick curtains left to\ndroop down, plunging the room into almost complete darkness, save for two\nsmall new electric lamps. Why the closed curtains? Was the kandra that\nconcerned about being seen?\nWayne lounged in Wax’s easy chair, feet up on the cocktail table, helping\nhimself to a bowl of walnuts. A woman stretched out in a similar posture in\nthe companion chair, wearing tight trousers and a loose blouse, eyes closed\nas she leaned back in the chair, hands behind her head. She wore a different\nbody from last time Wax had seen her, but the posture—and the height—\ngave him good clues that this was MeLaan.\nMarasi was inspecting some odd equipment set up on a pedestal at the\nback of the room. It was a box with small lenses on the front. She stood up\nstraight as soon as she saw him, and—being Marasi—blushed deeply.\n“Sorry about this,” she said. “We were going to go to my flat to talk, but\nWayne insisted.…”"

Lady Colms has been so kind as to listen\nto my proposition.”\n“Marasi?” Wax asked. “You went to Marasi?”\n“What?” VenDell asked. “That’s surprising to you? She was instrumental\nin the defeat of Miles Hundredlives. Not to mention her help during the riots\nPaalm instigated.”\nWax looked at the kandra. “You’re trying to get to me through another\nroute, aren’t you?”\n“Look who’s full of himself,” MeLaan said from her chair.\n“He’s always full of himself,” Wayne said, cracking a walnut. “Mostly on\naccount of him eatin’ his own fingernails. I seen him do it.”\n“Is it so ridiculous,” Marasi said, “that they’d actually want my help?”\n“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it that way,” Wax said, turning to her.\n“Then what way did you mean it?”\nWax sighed. “I don’t know, Marasi. It’s been a long day. I got shot at, got\na water tower dumped on my head, and had my wedding fall apart. Now\nWayne is dropping broken walnut shells all over my chair. Honestly, I think I\njust need a drink.”\nHe walked toward the bar at the back of the room. Marasi eyed him, and\nas he passed, she muttered, “Will you get me one too? Because this is all\nmaking me go a little crazy.”\nHe smiled, digging out some single-malt whiskey, pouring for himself and\nfor Marasi. VenDell disappeared out the door, but returned a few minutes\nlater with some piece of equipment that he hooked to the strange device. He\nran a wire from the device to one of the wall lamps, pulling out the bulb and\nscrewing in the end of the wire instead.\nLeaving would feel childish, so Wax leaned against the wall and sipped\nhis whiskey, saying nothing as VenDell turned on his machine. An image\nappeared on the wall.\nWax froze. It was a picture, similar to an evanotype—only on the wall and\nquite large. It displayed the Field of Rebirth in the center of Elendel, where\nthe tombs of Vin and Elend Venture were to be found. He’d never seen\nanything like that image. It seemed to have been created entirely by light.\nMarasi gasped.\nWayne threw a walnut at it.\n“What?” he said as the others glared at him. “Wanted to see if it was real.”\nHe hesitated, then threw another walnut. The nut made a shadow on the\nimage where it moved between the device and the wall. So it was light."

So it was light.\n“Image projector,” VenDell said. “They call it an evanoscope. By next\nyear these will be commonplace, I should think.” He paused. “Harmony\nimplies that if we find this wondrous, it will really burn our metals when the\nimages start moving.”\n“Moving?” Wax said, stepping forward. “How would they do that?”\n“We don’t know,” MeLaan said with a grimace. “He accidentally let it\nslip, but won’t say anything more.”\n“How does God,” Marasi asked, still staring at the image, “accidentally let\nsomething slip?”\n“As I said,” VenDell said, “He has been distracted lately. We’ve tried to\ntease out more regarding moving images, but so far no luck. He’s often like\nthis—says it’s vital that we discover things on our own.”\n“Like a chick breaking out of its shell,” MeLaan said. “He says that if we\ndon’t struggle and learn on our own, we won’t be strong enough to survive\nwhat is coming.”\nShe left the words hanging in the room, and Wax shared a look with\nMarasi.\n“Well…” Marasi said slowly, “that’s ominous. Has He said anything more\nabout Trell?”\nWax folded his arms. Trell. It was a god from the old records, long before\nthe Catacendre—indeed, long before the Lord Ruler. Harmony had\nmemorized this religion, with many others, during his days as a mortal.\nMarasi had an obsession with the god, and one that was not unwarranted.\nWax wasn’t certain whether her claim was true or not that the worship of\nTrell was involved in what had happened to Lessie, but the spikes they’d\ndiscovered … they didn’t seem to have been made of any metal known to\nman.\nThe kandra had confiscated those. Wax had been so deep in his sorrows\nthat by the time he’d started to recover, they’d already been taken.\n“No,” VenDell said. “And I have no update on the spikes, if that’s what\nyou’re wondering. But this task I have for you, Miss Colms, might provide\ninsight. Suffice it to say, we’re worried about the possible intrusion of\nanother god upon this domain.”\n“Hey,” MeLaan said, “what’s a girl gotta do to get some of that whiskey?”\n“Sister,” VenDell said, twisting something on his machine, making the\nimage brighter, “you are a representative of Harmony and His\nenlightenment.”\n“Yup,” MeLaan said, “and I’m a tragically sober one.”\nWax brought her a glass, and she grinned at him in thanks.\n“Chivalry,” she said, raising it.\n“Manipulation,” VenDell said. “Miss Colms, I spoke to you earlier of\nInvestiture and Identity. I promised you an explanation. Here.” He flipped\nsomething on his machine, changing the image on the wall to a list of\nFeruchemical metals, their attributes, and their natures. It wasn’t the pretty,\nartistic rendition that Wax often saw in popular lore—it was far less fancy,\nbut much more detailed."

It wasn’t the pretty,\nartistic rendition that Wax often saw in popular lore—it was far less fancy,\nbut much more detailed.\n“The basic physical abilities of Feruchemy are well understood,” VenDell\nsaid, walking forward and using a long reed to point at a section of the\nprojected chart. “Terris tradition and heritage has explored them for at least\nfifteen hundred years. Harmony left detailed explanations in the Words of\nFounding.\n“Likewise, the abilities in the so-called mental quadrant of the chart have\nbeen outlined and discussed, tested and defined. Our understanding doesn’t\nreach as far here—we don’t know why memories stored in a metalmind\ndegrade the way they do when removed, or why tapping mental speed tends\nto make one hungry, of all things—but still, we have a great deal of\nexperience in this area.”\nHe paused, and circled his pointer around a group of metals and abilities\nat the bottom: Fortune, Investiture, Identity, and Connection. Wax leaned\nforward. They’d spoken of these during his year living in the Village, but\nonly as part of the catechisms of Feruchemy and Terris belief. None of those\nspecified what the powers actually did. They were considered beyond\nunderstanding, like God, or time.\n“Chromium,” VenDell said, “nicrosil, aluminum, duralumin. These aren’t\nmetals that most ancients knew. Only in recent times have modern\nmetallurgical processes allowed them to become commonplace.”\n“Commonplace?” Wayne said. “With a single aluminum bullet, mate, I\ncould buy you an outfit that don’t look so stupid and have money left over\nfor a nice hat or two.”\n“Be that as it may,” VenDell said, “compared to the amount of aluminum\nin the world before the Catacendre, the metal is now common. Bauxite\nrefining, modern chemical processes, these have given us access to metals on\na level that was never before possible. Why, the Last Obligator’s\nautobiography explains that early aluminum was harvested from the inside\nof the Ashmounts!”\nWax stepped forward along the cone of light emanating from the machine.\n“So what do they do?”\n“Research is ongoing,” VenDell said. “Ferrings with these abilities are\nvery, very rare—and it is only in the last few decades that we’ve had access\nto enough of these metals to begin experimenting. Rebuilding society has\nbeen a … wearisome process.”\n“You were alive before,” Marasi said. “In the days of the Ascendant\nWarrior.”\nVenDell turned, raising his eyebrows. “Indeed, though I never met her.\nOnly TenSoon did.”\n“What was life like?” Marasi asked.\n“Hard,” VenDell said. “It was … hard.”\n“There are holes in our memories,” MeLaan added softly. “From when\nour spikes were removed. It took a piece out of us. There are things we’ll\nnever get back.”\nWax took a drink. There was a weight that came from speaking to the\nkandra, in realizing that most of them had already been alive for hundreds of\nyears when the World of Ash had ended. These were ancient beings. Perhaps\nWax should not be surprised by their presumption. To them, he—indeed,"

To them, he—indeed,\neveryone else alive—was little more than a child.\n“Identity,” VenDell said, slapping his reed against the wall, casting a\nshadow on the image. “Lord Ladrian, could another Feruchemist use your\nmetalminds?”\n“Of course not,” Wax said. “Everyone knows that.”\n“Why?”\n“Well … because. They’re mine.”\nFeruchemy was simple, elegant. Fill your metalmind with an attribute for\nan hour—like Wax’s weight, or Wayne’s health and healing—and you could\ndraw out an hour’s worth of that attribute later on. Alternatively, you could\ndraw out a burst of power that was extremely intense but lasted only a\nmoment.\n“The raw power of both Allomancy and Feruchemy,” VenDell said, “is\nsomething we call Investiture. This is very important, as in Feruchemy, an\nindividual’s Investiture is keyed specifically to them. To what we call\nIdentity.”\n“You’ve made me curious,” Wax said, looking at the wall as VenDell\nleisurely walked back to his machine. “How does it know? My\nmetalminds … do they recognize me?”\n“After a fashion,” VenDell said, changing the image to one of a\nFeruchemist tapping strength. The woman’s muscles had grown to several\ntimes their normal size as she lifted a horse above her head. “Each man or\nwoman has a Spiritual aspect, a piece of themselves that exists in another\nRealm entirely. You might call it your soul. Your Investiture is keyed to your\nsoul—indeed, it might be a part of your soul, much as your blood is a part of\nyour body.”\n“So if a person could store their Identity,” Marasi said, “as Waxillium\ndoes with his weight…”\n“They’d be without it for a time,” VenDell said. “A blank slate, so to\nspeak.”\n“So they could use anyone’s metalmind?” Marasi asked.\n“Possibly,” VenDell said. He cycled through pictures of several more\nFeruchemists using their abilities before coming to rest on an image of a set\nof bracers. Simple metal bands, like wide bracelets, meant to be worn on the\nupper arms beneath clothing. It was impossible to tell the type of metal\nwithout color, but they had ancient Terris markings engraved on them.\n“Some have been experimenting with your idea,” VenDell said, “and early\nresults are promising. However, having a Feruchemist who can use anyone’s\nmetalminds is intriguing, but not particularly life-changing. Our society is\nstrewn with individuals who have extraordinary abilities—this would simply\nbe one more variety. No, what interests me is the opposite, Miss Colms.\nWhat if a Feruchemist were to divest himself of all Identity, then fill another\nmetalmind with an attribute. Say, strength. What would it do?”\n“Create an unkeyed metalmind?” Marasi asked. “One that another\nFeruchemist could access?”\n“Possibly,” VenDell said. “Or is there another possibility? Most people\nliving right now have at least some Feruchemist blood in them. Could it be"

Could it be\nthat such a metalmind as I describe, one that is keyed to no single individual,\nmight be usable by anyone?”\nUnderstanding settled on Wax like a slowly burned metal. From the chair\nbeside the image device, Wayne whistled slowly.\n“Anyone could be a Feruchemist,” Wax said.\nVenDell nodded. “Investiture—the innate ability to burn metals or tap\nmetalminds—is also one of the things Feruchemy can store. Lord\nWaxillium … these are arts we are only beginning to comprehend. But the\nsecrets they contain could change the world.\n“In the ancient days, the Last Emperor discovered a metal that\ntransformed him into a Mistborn. A metal anyone could burn, it is said. This\nwhispers of a hidden possibility, something lesser, but still incredible. What\nif one could somehow manipulate Identity and Investiture to create a set of\nbracers which imparted Feruchemical or Allomantic ability upon the person\nwearing them? One could make any person a Mistborn, or a Feruchemist, or\nboth at once.”\nThe room fell silent.\nA walnut bounced off VenDell’s head.\nHe immediately turned to glare at Wayne.\n“Sorry,” Wayne said. “Just had trouble believing someone could be so\nmelodramatic, so I figured you might not be real. Hadda check, ya know?”\nVenDell rubbed his forehead, breathing out sharply in annoyance.\n“This is all fascinating,” Wax admitted. “But unfortunately, it’s also\nimpossible.”\n“And why is that?” VenDell asked.\n“You don’t even know how, or if, this would work,” Wax said, waving\ntoward the screen. “And even if you could figure it out, you’d need a Full\nFeruchemist. Someone with at least two Feruchemical powers, as they’d\nneed to be able to store their Identity in a metalmind along with another\nFeruchemical attribute. Rusts! To do what you proposed a moment ago, and\ncreate Allomancers too, you’d basically need someone who was already both\nMistborn and Full Feruchemist.”\n“This is true,” VenDell said.\n“And how long has it been since a Full Feruchemist was born?”\n“A very, very long time,” VenDell said. “But, being born a Feruchemist\nisn’t the only way to make this happen.”\nWax hesitated, then shared a look with Marasi. She nodded, and he strode\nacross the room to pull back the wooden panel hiding his wall safe. He did\nthe combination and removed the book that Ironeyes had sent him. He\nturned, raising it. “Hemalurgy? Harmony hates it. I’ve read what the Lord\nMistborn had to say on the topic.”\n“Yes,” VenDell said. “Hemalurgy is … problematic.”\n“In part because we wouldn’t exist without it,” MeLaan said. “That’s not a\nparticularly fun thing to know—that people had to be murdered in order to\nbring you to sapience.”"

Instead, we’re\nwaiting. A Full Feruchemist is bound to be born among mankind eventually\n—particularly with the Terris elite working so hard to preserve and condense\ntheir bloodlines. Unfortunately, our … restraint will not be shared by\neveryone. There are those who are growing very close to understanding how\nall this works.”\nMy uncle, Wax thought, looking down at the book in his fingers. So far as\nhe could tell, Edwarn—the man known as Mister Suit—was trying to breed\nAllomancers. What would he do with Hemalurgy, if he knew about it?\n“We need to stay ahead of those who might use this for ill purposes,”\nVenDell said. “We need to experiment and determine how these Identity-free\nmetalminds would work.”\n“Doing so will be dangerous,” Wax said. “Mixing the powers is incredibly\ndangerous.”\n“Says the Twinborn,” MeLaan said.\n“I’m safe,” Wax said, glancing at her. “My powers don’t compound—\nthey’re from different metals.”\n“They may not compound,” VenDell said, “but they’re still fascinating,\nLord Waxillium. Any mixing of Allomancy and Feruchemy has\nunanticipated effects.”\n“What is it about you,” Wax said, “that makes me want to punch you,\neven when you’re saying something helpful?”\n“None of us have been able to figure it out,” MeLaan said, waving for\nWayne to toss her a walnut. “One of the cosmere’s great mysteries.”\n“Now, now, Lord Ladrian,” VenDell said, holding up his hands. “Is that\nthe way to speak to someone who bears your ancestor’s hands?”\n“His … hands?” Wax said. “Are you speaking metaphorically?”\n“Ah, no,” VenDell said. “Breeze did say I could have them after he died.\nExcellent metacarpals. I bring them out for special occasions.”\nWax stood still for a moment, holding the book in his hand, trying to\ndigest what the kandra had just said. His ancestor, the first Lord Ladrian,\nCounselor of Gods … had given this creature his hands.\nIn a way, Wax had shaken hands with Breeze’s corpse. He stared at his\nglass, surprised to find it empty, and poured some more whiskey.\n“This has been a very enlightening lesson,” Marasi said. “But pardon,\nYour Holiness, you still haven’t explained what you need from me.”\nVenDell changed the picture to one of an illustration. A man with long\ndark hair and a bare chest, wearing a cloak that extended behind him into\neternity. His arms, crossed before him, were wrapped with intricate bracers\nin a fanciful design. Wax recognized the iconography, if not the specific\nimage. Rashek. The First Emperor.\nThe Lord Ruler.\n“What do you know of the Bands of Mourning, Miss Colms?” VenDell\nasked."

The First Emperor.\nThe Lord Ruler.\n“What do you know of the Bands of Mourning, Miss Colms?” VenDell\nasked.\n“The Lord Ruler’s metalminds,” Marasi said with a shrug. “Relics from\nmythology, like the Lady Mistborn’s knives, or the Lance of the Fountains.”\n“There are four individuals,” VenDell said, “who, to our knowledge, have\nheld the power of Ascension. Rashek, the Survivor, the Ascendant Warrior,\nand Lord Harmony Himself. Harmony’s Ascension granted Him a precise\nand in-depth knowledge of the Metallic Arts. It stands to reason that the Lord\nRuler gained the same information. He understood Identity as a\nFeruchemical ability, and knew the hidden metals. Indeed, he gave\naluminum to his Inquisitors.”\nVenDell flipped the image to a more detailed illustration of those arms\nwrapped in bands of metal. “Curiously, nobody knows exactly what\nhappened to the Bands of Mourning. Back when the Lord Ruler fell,\nTenSoon had not yet joined the Ascendant Warrior, and though he swears he\nheard them mentioned, the holes in his memory prevent him from saying\nhow or when.\n“The mythology surrounding the Bands is quite extensive. You can find\nmyths about them dating back to before the Catacendre, and you can find\nsomeone telling new ones in a pub around the corner, invented on the spot\nfor your amusement. But a theme runs through them all—if you held the\nLord Ruler’s bracers, you supposedly gained his powers.”\n“That’s just fancy,” Wax said. “It’s a natural thing to wish for, to make\nstories about. It doesn’t mean anything.”\n“Doesn’t it?” VenDell asked. “Lore says the Bands have the very power\nthat science has only now determined is plausible to assemble?”\n“Coincidence,” Wax said. “And just because he might have created\nsomething doesn’t mean he did, and just because you think Identity works\nlike you say, doesn’t mean you’re right. Besides, the Bands would have been\ndestroyed when Harmony remade the world. And that’s not even considering\nthat it would be foolish for the Lord Ruler to create weapons someone else\ncould use against him.”\nVenDell clicked his machine. The image changed to another evanotype,\nthis one of a mural on a wall. It depicted a room with a central dais in the\nshape of a truncated pyramid. Set upon a pedestal on the dais was a pair of\nbracers made of delicate, curling metal, shaped in spirals.\nOnly a mural. But it did seem like it was depicting the Bands of\nMourning.\n“What is that?” Marasi asked.\n“One of our brothers,” MeLaan said, sitting up in her chair, “a kandra\nnamed ReLuur, took this image.”\n“The Bands of Mourning fascinated him,” VenDell said. “ReLuur spent\nthe last two centuries chasing them. He recently returned to Elendel bearing\nan evanotype camera in his pack and these pictures.” VenDell clicked to the\nnext image, a picture of a large metal plate set into a wall and inscribed with\na strange script.\nWax narrowed his eyes. “I don’t know that language.”"

Even the old languages in Harmony’s\nrecords bear no resemblance to this script.”\nWax felt a chill as the images continued. Another shot of the strange\nlanguage. A statue that resembled the Lord Ruler, bearing a long spear. This\nappeared to be covered in frost. Another shot of the mural, more detailed,\nwhich depicted bracers with many different metals twining together. Not\nbracers for a Ferring like Wax, but bracers for a Full Feruchemist.\nOnly a mural, yes. But it was compelling.\n“ReLuur believed in the Bands,” VenDell said. “He claims to have seen\nthem, though his camera bore no image of the actual relics. I’m inclined to\ntrust his words.”\nVenDell showed another image, of a different mural. It depicted a man\nstanding atop a peak, hands raised above him and a glowing spear hovering\nthere, just beyond his touch. A corpse slumped at his feet. Wax went\nforward, walking into the stream of light until he was standing right in front\nof the image, looking up at the portion he wasn’t blocking.

He looked from VenDell to\nMeLaan. “What?” he asked them.\n“He’s missing a spike,” MeLaan said. “Best we could determine, he was\naccosted before he could return here from the mountains near the Southern\nRoughs.”\n“We can’t get any straight answers out of him,” VenDell said. “A kandra\nwith a missing spike … well, they aren’t quite sane any longer. As you well\nknow.”\nWax shivered, a pit of emptiness shifting inside him. “Yes.”\n“So, Miss Colms,” VenDell said, stepping away from his machine. “This\nis where you come in. ReLuur was … is … one of our finest. Of the Third\nGeneration, he is an explorer, an expert at bodies, and a genius. Losing him\nwould be a great blow to us.”\n“We can’t reproduce,” MeLaan said. “Our numbers are set. The Thirds\nlike ReLuur … they’re our parents, our exemplars. Our leaders. He is\nprecious.”\n“We would like you to recover his spike,” VenDell said. “From whoever\ntook it. This will restore his sanity, and hopefully his memories.”\n“The longer he goes without it, the bigger the holes will be,” MeLaan\nsaid.\n“So perhaps you can understand our urgency,” VenDell said. “And why I"

        "text": "“The longer he goes without it, the bigger the holes will be,” MeLaan\nsaid.\n“So perhaps you can understand our urgency,” VenDell said. “And why I\nfound it prudent to interrupt Lord Ladrian, even on what was obviously an\nimportant day. When ReLuur returned to us, he was missing an entire arm\nand half his chest. Though he will not—or cannot—speak of where he got\nthese pictures, he is able to recall being attacked in New Seran. We believe\nsomeone ambushed him there, on his return, and stole the artifacts he had\ndiscovered.”\n“They have his spike,” MeLaan said, voice tense. “It’s still there. It has to\nbe.”\n“Wait, wait,” Marasi said. “Why not give him another spike? You’ve got\nenough of them lying around to make earrings, like the one you gave\nWaxillium.”\nThe two kandra looked at her as if she were mad, but Wax couldn’t see\nwhy. He thought the question was an excellent one.\n“You are misunderstanding the nature of these spikes,” VenDell all but\nsputtered. “First, we do not have kandra Blessings ‘lying around.’ The\nearrings you mention are crafted from old Inquisitor spikes, and have barely\nany potency to them. One might have been good enough for Lord\nWaxillium’s little stunt six months ago, but they would hardly be enough to\nrestore a kandra.”\n“Yeah,” MeLaan said. “If that worked, we’d have already used all those\nspikes to make new children. We can’t; a kandra Blessing must be created\nvery specifically.”\n“We did try something akin to what you suggest,” VenDell admitted.\n“TenSoon … relinquished one of his own spikes to give our fallen brother a\nfew moments of lucidity. It was very painful for TenSoon, and—\nunfortunately—accomplished nothing. ReLuur only screamed, begging for\nhis spike. He spat out TenSoon’s a moment later. Trying to use someone\nelse’s spikes when you don’t have your own already can provoke radical\nchanges in personality, memory, and temperament.”\n“Lessie,” Wax said, voice hoarse. “She … she changed spikes frequently.”\n“And each was a spike created specifically for her,” VenDell said. “Not\none that had been used by another kandra. And besides, would you call her\nparticularly stable, Lord Waxillium? You must trust us on this; we have done\nwhat we can. Here, at least.\n“MeLaan will be traveling to New Seran to investigate and retrieve\nReLuur’s missing spike. Miss Colms, we would like you to join her and help\nrecover our brother’s mind. We can intervene with your superiors in the\nconstable precinct, and make certain you are assigned field duty working for\nthe government in a clandestine fashion. If you can restore ReLuur’s spike,\nwe will be able to find answers.”\nVenDell eyed Wax. “This will not be a wild hunt for some impossible\nartifact. All we want is our friend back. Of course, any clues you can\ndiscover regarding where he went on his quest, and where he got these\npictures, would be appreciated. There are some people of interest in New\nSeran, nobility that ReLuur is fixated upon for reasons we can’t get out of"

        "text": "pictures, would be appreciated. There are some people of interest in New\nSeran, nobility that ReLuur is fixated upon for reasons we can’t get out of\nhim.”\nWax studied the last image for a time longer. It was tempting. Mystical\nartifacts were all well and good, but someone attacking—and nearly killing\n—one of the Faceless Immortals? That was interesting.\n“I’ll go,” Marasi said from behind him. “I’ll do it. But … I wouldn’t mind\nhelp. Waxillium?”\nA part of him longed to go. Escape the parties and the dances, the political\nengagements and business meetings. The kandra would know that; Harmony\nwould know that.\nAnger simmered deep within him at the thought. He’d hunted Lessie, and\nthey hadn’t told him.\n“This sounds like the perfect challenge for your skills, Marasi,” he found\nhimself saying. “I doubt you need me. You are perfectly capable, and I feel a\nfool for having implied otherwise, even accidentally. If you do want\ncompany, however, perhaps Wayne would be willing to provide some extra\nprotection. I’m afraid that I, however, must—”\nThe image on the wall flickered to a shot of a city with grand waterfalls.\nNew Seran? He’d never been there. The streets were overgrown with foliage,\nand people promenaded about in clothing of striped brown suits and soft\nwhite dresses.\n“Ah, I forgot,” VenDell said. “There was one other image in ReLuur’s\nbelongings. We discovered it last, as the others were packed carefully away\nto await development. We suspect this image was taken in New Seran, just\nbefore the attack.”\n“And why should I care?” Wax said. “It…”\nHe trailed off, feeling an icy shock as he recognized someone in the\npicture. He stepped back into the stream of light, pressing his hand against\nthe white wall, trying—fruitlessly—to feel the image. “Impossible.”\nShe stood between two men who held to her arms tightly, as if pulling her\nforward against her will. Keeping her prisoner even in broad daylight. She\nhad glanced over her shoulder toward the camera as the evanotype was\ntaken. It must be one of the new models he’d been hearing about, that didn’t\nrequire the subject to stand still for the image to set.\nThe woman was in her forties, lean but solid, with long dark hair framing\na face that—despite their years apart—Wax knew very, very well.\nTelsin. His sister.\n4\nTwo hours after the strange meeting, Wayne puttered through Wax’s\nmansion, peeking behind pictures, lifting up vases. Where did he keep the\ngood stuff?\n“It is her, Steris,” Wax was saying in the ground-floor sitting room not far\naway. “And that man with his back turned, holding her by the arm, that\ncould be my uncle. They’re involved in this. I have to go.”\nIt had always seemed funny to Wayne how rich folk got to decide what\nwas valuable. He inspected a picture frame that was likely pure gold. Why\ndid anyone care about this shiny stuff? Gold could do some fun things with\nFeruchemy, but it was pure rubbish when it came to Allomancy."

        "text": "did anyone care about this shiny stuff? Gold could do some fun things with\nFeruchemy, but it was pure rubbish when it came to Allomancy.\nWell, rich folk liked it. So they paid a lot for it, and that made it valuable.\nNo other reason.\nHow did they decide what was valuable? Did they all just gather together,\nsit around in their suits and gowns, and say, “Oi. Let’s start eatin’ fish eggs,\nand make the stuff real expensive. That’ll rust their brains, it will.” Then\nthey’d have a nice round of rich folks’ laughter and throw some servants off\nthe top of a building to see what kind of splats they’d make when they hit.\nWayne put the picture back. He refused to play by rich people’s rules.\nHe’d decide for himself what something was worth. And that frame was\nugly. Didn’t help none that Steris’s cousins, who were depicted in the\nevanotype it held, looked like fish.\n“Then you should most certainly go, Lord Waxillium,” Steris said. “Why\nthe concern? We can make arrangements to postpone other duties.”\n“It’s infuriating, Steris!” Even from out in the hall, Wayne could hear the\nI’m pacing in his tone. “Not a word of apology, from them or Harmony\nregarding what they did to me. VenDell made offhanded comments—\nreferring to me shooting Lessie as a ‘stunt.’ They used me. Lessie was only\ntrying, in a broken way, to free me from them. Now they saunter back, no\nmention of what I lost, and expect me to just pick up and do their bidding\nagain.”\nPoor Wax. That had busted him up right good, it had. And Wayne could\nsee why. Still, an apology? Did people what got killed in a flood expect an\napology from God? God did as God wished. You simply hoped to not get on\nHis worse side. Kinda like the bouncer at the club with the pretty sister.\nHarmony wasn’t the only god, anyway. And that was what Wayne was\nabout today.\nAfter some silence, Wax continued, more softly. “I have to go. Even after\nwhat they did, if my uncle is really involved in this … if I can free Telsin …\nI have to go. Tomorrow night, there will be a gathering of the outer cities\npolitical elite in New Seran. Governor Aradel is rightly concerned, and was\ngoing to send a representative anyway. It gives me a plausible excuse to be\nin the city. Marasi can look for the lost spike; I can hunt down my uncle.”\n“It is decided, then,” Steris said. “Will we be leaving immediately?”\nWax was silent for a moment. “We?”\n“I assumed … I mean, if you are taking my sister, it would look very odd\nif I were not accompanying you.” Wayne felt like he could hear her blush. “I\ndon’t mean to be presumptuous. You may, of course, do as you wish, but—”\n“No,” he said. “You’re right. It would look odd to go alone. The gathering\nwill include a reception, after all. I don’t want to imply … I mean…”\n“I can go, but stay out of your way.”\n“It could be dangerous. I can’t ask it of you.”"

I can’t ask it of you.”\n“If this is what you feel you must do, then I will be happy to take the\nrisk.”\n“I…”\nRusts. Those two were as awkward as a man suddenly splitting his cheeks\nin church. Wayne shook his head, picking up one of the vases in the\nentryway. Good pottery, with a nice swirly-dirly pattern. Maybe that would\ndo for his offering.\nSomeone knocked on the door, and Wayne put the vase back. It didn’t feel\nright. He took one of the flowers though, and traded it for an extra sock from\nhis back pocket. Huh. He had a silverware set in his other pocket. From the\nwedding breakfast? Yeah, that was right. They’d put out a place setting for\nhim, had his name and everything. That meant the silverware had been his.\nHe put the fork, knife, and spoon back in his pocket and tucked the flower\nbehind his ear, then walked to the door, reaching it right before that butler\ndid. He gave the man a glare—it was only a matter of time before he cracked\nand tried to kill them all—then pulled open the door.\nThat kandra bloke stood on the other side. His suit now was an even\nlighter shade of tan. “You,” Wayne said, pointing. “We just got ridda you!” It\nhad only been … what, two hours since he left?\n“Good afternoon, young lad,” the kandra said. “Are the adults home?”\nDarriance quite politely pushed Wayne aside and gestured for VenDell to\nenter. “You are expected, sir.”\n“He is?” Wayne said.\n“Master Ladrian said to send you in,” the butler said, pointing toward the\nsitting room.\n“Thank you,” VenDell said, striding toward the room.\nWayne caught up with him quickly.\n“Nice flower,” the kandra said. “Can I have your skeleton when you’re\ndead?”\n“My…” Wayne felt at his head.\n“You’re a Bloodmaker, correct? Can heal yourself? Bloodmaker bones\ntend to be particularly interesting, as your time spent weak and sickly creates\noddities in your joints and bones that can be quite distinctive. I’d love to\nhave your skeleton. If you don’t mind.”\nTaken aback by this request, Wayne stopped in place. Then he ran past\nhim, pushing into the room where Wax and Steris were talking. “Wax,” he\ncomplained, pointing, “the immortal bloke is being creepy again.”\n“Greetings, Lord Ladrian,” VenDell said, walking in and holding up a\nfolder. “Your tickets, along with transcripts of everything we’ve been able to\npry out of ReLuur. I warn you, most of it isn’t terribly lucid.”\nWayne glanced at Wax’s liquor cabinet. Maybe something in there would\nwork for what he needed for his offering.\n“I haven’t said that I’d go,” Wax told the immortal. “You’re roping me\ninto this, sure as sheep in a pen.”\n“Yes,” the immortal said. He held out the folder again. “In here is a list of"

        "text": "into this, sure as sheep in a pen.”\n“Yes,” the immortal said. He held out the folder again. “In here is a list of\npeople ReLuur mentions. You’ll find it interesting that he lists several,\nincluding the woman holding the party I’m sending you to, as having had\ninteractions with your uncle.”\nWax sighed, then accepted it. He gestured to Steris, who had risen to\ncurtsy. “My fiancée. We were debating whether she should accompany me or\nnot.”\n“We have made provisions for whatever you decide,” VenDell said.\n“Though it will look less suspicious if you go too, Lady Harms, I cannot\nguarantee your safety.”\n“It might be helpful if you accompanied us, VenDell,” Wax said. “We\ncould use an extra Metalborn.”\nVenDell’s eyes bulged, and he turned white, like he’d been told his baby\nhad been born with two noses. “Go out into the field? Me? Lord Ladrian, I\nassure you, that’s not what you want.”\n“Why not?” Wax asked, leaning back against the wall. “You’re practically\nimpossible to kill, and you can change your rusting shape into anything you\nwant.”\n“Wait,” Wayne said, turning away from the liquor cabinet. “You can turn\ninto anything? Like a bunny?”\n“Very small animals are extremely difficult, as we need a certain mass to\nhold our cognitive functions and—”\n“Bunny,” Wayne said. “Can you be a bunny.”\n“If absolutely necessary.”\n“So that’s what that damn book was about.”\nVenDell sighed, looking toward Wax. “MeLaan can perform any\ntransformations you might need. I honor the First Contract, Lord Ladrian.\nBesides, the outside doesn’t suit me. There’s too much…” He waved his\nhands in front of him.\n“Too much what?” Wax asked, frowning.\n“Everything,” VenDell said—though Wayne didn’t miss that the rusting\nbunny glanced at him when he said it.\nWayne shook his head, trying the liquor cabinet. It was locked,\nunfortunately. What a fine heap of trust Wax showed in him.\n“My sister will meet you at the station,” VenDell said. “Track seventeen,\nin four hours.”\n“Four hours?” Steris said. “I need to send for the maids! And the valet!\nAnd…” She raised a hand to her head, looking faint. “And I need to make a\nlist.”\n“We’ll be there, VenDell,” Wax said.\n“Excellent,” the kandra fellow said, fishing in his pocket. Wayne got\ninterested, until he came out with a dull old bent earring, simple, old-style. “I\nbrought you one of these.”\n“No thanks.”\n“But, if you need to—”\n“No thanks,” Wax said.\nThe look between the two of them grew real uncomfortable, like each was\naccusing the other of having made an unpersonable stench of some sort.\n“Good, good,” Wayne said, drifting toward the door. “Meet you all at the\nstation.”\n“Aren’t you going to pack?” Steris called after him.\n“Sack’s in my room,” Wayne called back. “Under my bed. I’m always\npacked and ready to go, mate. Never can tell when a misunderstandin’ will"

Never can tell when a misunderstandin’ will\ncrop up.” He turned away, popped his hat off the rack, flipped it onto his\nhead, and ducked out the front door.\nLeave them to their discussing and their arguing and their creepy\nimmortal bunnies. He had things that needed to be done. Well, one thing at\nleast.\nWayne had a quest.\nHe whistled as he danced down the steps. A simple tune, easy and\nfamiliar, with an accompanying beat playing in his mind. Ba-bum, ba-bum,\nba-bum. Quick, energetic. He strolled down the street, but found himself less\nand less pleased with his flower. It was not the proper offering for the god\nwith whom he must meet. Too obvious, too soft.\nHe spun it in his fingers, thoughtful, softly whistling his tune. No better\nideas came to him. This area was too fancy, with mansions and gardens and\nmen clipping hedges. The streets didn’t even stink of horse dung. It was hard\nto think in a place like this; everyone knew the best thinking happened in\nalleyways and slums. Places where the brain had to be alert, even panicked\n—where the bugger knew that if it didn’t perk up and get some geniusing\ndone, you were likely to get yourself stabbed, and then where would it be?\nHolding your brain hostage against your own stupidity—that was how to\nget stuff done. Wayne made his way to a nearby canal, and searched out a\ngondola man who looked bored.\n“My good man,” Wayne said to himself. “My good man.” Yeah, that was\nit. Speak like you couldn’t breathe right—high First Octant accent, with a\nlittle Terris stirred in. Rich accent. Very rich.\n“You, boatman!” Wayne called, waving. “Hey! Oh, do hurry. I haven’t the\ntime!”\nThe boatman poled over.\n“Quickly now, quickly, my good man!” Wayne shouted. “Tell me. How\nmuch for the day?”\n“The day?” the boatman said.\n“Yes, yes,” Wayne said, hopping into the boat. “I have need of your\nservices for the entire day.” Wayne settled himself without waiting for a\nresponse. “Onward, now. Up the Fourth-Fifth Canal, turn right around the\nHub, then east up the Irongate. First stop is in the Third Octant. She’s\ncounting on me, you know.”\n“The whole day,” the boatman said, eager. “Yes, sir, um … my lord.…”\n“Ladrian,” Wayne said. “Waxillium Ladrian. We aren’t moving. Why\naren’t we moving?”\nThe boatman began poling, so gleeful at the prospect of many hours of\nemployment that he forgot to ask for any money up front.\n“Fifty,” the man finally said.\n“Hmm?”\n“Fifty. For the whole day.”\n“Yes, yes, fine,” Wayne said. Dirty thief, he thought. Trying to cheat an\nupstanding citizen, and a house lord at that, merely because he acted a little\ndistracted?

When his grandfather Ladrian\nhad been house lord, men had known how to be respectful. Why, a boatman\nin those days would have dunked himself in the canal before taking a wuzing\nmore than he was due!\n“If you don’t mind me asking, my lord,” the boatman said. “And I mean\nno offense … but your clothing.”\n“Yes?” Wayne asked, straightening his Roughs coat.\n“Is something wrong with it?”\n“Wrong with it?” Wayne said, stuffing his accent so full of noble\nindignation it was practically bleeding. “Wrong with it? Man, do you not\nfollow fashion?”\n“I—”\n“Thomton Delacour himself designed these clothes!” Wayne said.\n“Northern outlands inspiration. It’s the height, I tell you! The height. A\nCoinshot couldn’t get higher!”\n“Sorry. Sorry, my lord. I said I didn’t want to offend!”\n“You can’t just say ‘don’t be offended’ and then say something offensive,\nman! That’s not how it works.” Wayne settled back, arms folded.\nThe boatman, wisely, said nothing more to him. After about ten minutes of\ntravel, the time had arrived.\n“Now,” Wayne said, as if to himself, “we’ll need to stop at Glimmering\nPoint docks. And then a skid along Stansel Belt.”\nHe let his accent shift, a little of the Knobs—a slum—slipping in. Dull\naccent, like a mouth filled with cotton. The folks there used the word “skid”\nfor practically anything. Distinctive word, that. Skiiiid. Sounded like it\nshould be something dirty.\n“Um, my lord?”\n“Hm?” Wayne said. “Oh, just going over my errands. My nephew is\ngetting married—you might have heard of the wedding, it’s all the talk of the\ncity. So many errands. Yes indeed, the day will be quite the skid.”\nThat was a ruffian’s accent, but just a hint, like the lemon in a good hot\ntoddy. He slipped it in under the highborn accent.\nThe boatman started to get uncomfortable. “You said the Stansel Belt?\nNot a nice area, that.”\n“Need to hire some workers,” Wayne said absently.\nThe boatman continued poling, but he was nervous now. Tapping his foot,\nmoving the pole more quickly, ignoring calls from colleagues they passed.\nSomething was wrong. Like the scent of a meat pie left under the sofa for a\nfew days. A whole day’s hiring? An outrageous sum? It might instead be a\nsetup. Pretend to be a lord, then lure him into the slums to be robbed.…\n“My lord!” the man said. “I just realized. Gotta get back. Can’t be hired\nfor the whole day. My mother, she’ll need me.”\n“What nonsense is this?” Wayne demanded. “I haven’t the time for your\nprattle, man! And catching another boat will waste my precious time. I’ll\ndouble your fee.”\nNow, the man was really anxious. “Sorry, my lord,” he said, poling to the\nside of the canal. “Very sorry. Can’t do it.”"

And we’re not even halfway down portway!”\n“Sorry, my lord!” the man said, poling away as quickly as he could.\n“Sorry!”\nWayne cocked his hat, grinned, and checked the sign hanging from the\nstreetlamp. Exactly where he’d wanted to go, and not a clip paid. He started\nwhistling and strolled along the canal, keeping an eye out for a better\noffering. What would the god want?\nMaybe that? he wondered, eyeing a line of people waiting at Old Dent’s\nroadside cart, wanting to buy some of his fried potatoes. Seemed a good bet.\nWayne wandered over. “Need some help, Dent?”\nThe old man looked up and wiped his brow. “Five clips a small pouch,\neight for a large, Wayne. And don’t eat none of the stock, or I’ll fry your\nfingers.”\nWayne grinned, slipping behind the cart as the man turned back to his\nbrazier and stirred a batch that was frying. Wayne took the customers’\nmoney—and didn’t eat much of the stock—until the last man in line arrived,\na fancy-looking fellow in a doorman’s jacket. Probably worked at one of the\nhotels down the lane. Good tips at those jobs.\n“Three large,” the man said.\nWayne got his potatoes, took the man’s money, then hesitated. “Actually,”\nWayne said, holding up a note, “do you have change? We got too many large\nbills.”\n“I suppose,” the man said, digging in his nice eelskin wallet.\n“Great, here’s a twenty.”\n“I’ve got two fives and ten ones,” the man said, putting them down.\n“Thanks.” Wayne took them, then hesitated. “Actually, I’ve got plenty of\nones. Could I get that ten I saw in your wallet?”\n“Fine.”\nWayne gave him a handful of coins and took the ten.\n“Hey,” the man said, “there are only seven here.”\n“Whoops!” Wayne said.\n“What are you doing, Wayne?” Old Dent said. “There’s more change in\nthe box under there.”\n“Really?” Wayne glanced. “Rusts. Okay, how about you just give me my\ntwenty back?” He counted the man back thirteen and poured the coins and\nbills into his hand.\nThe man sighed, and gave Wayne the twenty. “Can I just get some sauce\nfor my chips?”\n“Sure, sure,” Wayne said, squeezing some sauce onto the pouches, beside\nthe potatoes. “That’s a nice wallet. Whaddaya want for it?”\nThe man hesitated, looking at his wallet.\n“I’ll give you this,” Wayne said, plucking the flower off his ear and\nholding it out with a banknote worth ten.\nThe man shrugged and handed over the empty wallet, taking the bill and"

The bill was ’cuz I\nsomehow ended up with an extra ten completely on accident, very innocent-\nlike.” He smiled, helped himself to a pouch of chips, and went wandering\noff.\nThat wallet was nice. His god would like that. Everyone needed wallets,\nright? He got it out and opened and closed it repeatedly, until he noticed that\none side was worn.\nRusts. He’d been cheated! This wouldn’t work at all for an offering. He\nshook his head, walking along the canal promenade. A pair of urchins sat on\none side, hands out for coins. The melancholy sound of a busker rose from a\nlittle farther down the path. Wayne was near the Breakouts, a nice slum, and\nhe caught whiffs of their distinctive odor. Fortunately the aroma wafting\nfrom a nearby bakery overwhelmed most of it.\n“Here’s the thing,” he said to one of the urchins, a girl not seven. He\nsettled down on his haunches. “I ain’t travailed enough.”\n“… Sir?” the girl asked.\n“In the old stories of quests, you gotta travail. That’s like traveling, but\nwith an ailment stapled on. Headaches and the like; maybe a sore backside\ntoo.”\n“Can … can I have a coin, sir?”\n“Ain’t got no coins,” Wayne said, thinking. “Damn. In the stories they\nalways tip the urchins, don’t they? Lets ya know they’re the heroes and such.\nHold here for a sec.”\nHe stood up and burst into the bakery, real heroic-like. A woman behind\nthe counter was just pulling a rack of meat buns out of the oven. Wayne\nslammed his fork down onto the plain wooden countertop, leaving it\nflourished there like a rusting legendary sword.\n“How many buns’ll you give me for this?” he asked.\nThe baker frowned, looking at him, then taking the fork. She turned it\nover in her fingers. “Mister,” she said, “this is silver.”\n“So … how many?” Wayne asked.\n“A bunch.”\n“A bunch’ll do, fair merchant.”\nA moment later he emerged from the bakery holding three large paper\nsacks filled with a dozen buns each. He dropped a handful of change the\nbaker had insisted on giving him into the urchins’ hands, then held up a\nfinger as their jaws dropped.\n“You,” he said, “must earn this.”\n“How, sir?”"

Don’t eat\nmore than four yourselves, all right?”\n“Four?” the girl said. “All for me?”\n“Well, five, but you bargain hard. Little cheat.” He left them stunned and\ndanced along the edge of the canal, passing the busker, who sat strumming\nan old guitar.\n“Something lively, minstrel!” Wayne called, tossing the silver spoon into\nthe man’s overturned hat, which awaited tips.\n“Here now,” the man said. “What’s this?” He squinted. “A spoon?”\n“Merchants are apparently desperate for the things!” Wayne called.\n“They’ll give you half a hunnerd meat buns for one, with change to boot.\nNow, give me ‘The Last Breath,’ minstrel!”\nThe man shrugged, and started plucking the song from Wayne’s mind. Ba-\nbum, ba-bum, ba-bum. Quick, energetic. Wayne rocked back and forth, eyes\nclosed. The end of an era, he thought. A god to be appeased.\nHe heard the two urchins laughing, and opened his eyes to see them\ntossing meat buns at the people they passed. Wayne smiled, then kicked\nhimself in a smooth skid along the edge of the canal, which was slippery\nwith a coating of slime. He managed to go a good ten feet before losing his\nbalance and slipping.\nWhich, of course, plunged him right into the canal.\nCoughing, he pulled himself up onto the side. Well, maybe this would\ncount as a travail. If not, it was probably poetry, considering what he’d done\nto Wax this morning.\nHe fished out his hat, then put his back to the canal. That was the way to\ngo. Eyes forward, back turned toward the past. No sense getting your nose\nstuck in things that don’t matter anymore. He continued on his way, trailing\nwater and spinning the last of the silverware—the knife—in his fingers. This\nwas not the right offering for his quest. He was pretty sure of it. But what\nwas?\nHe stopped at the next canal bridge, then stepped back. A short man in a\nuniform he didn’t recognize was walking down a nearby street with a little\nbook in hand. Motorcars were parked here in various positions, most partly\nup onto the sidewalks. The man in the uniform stopped at each one, writing\nsomething down in his book.\nWayne followed after him. “Here now,” he asked the man. “What’re you\ndoing?”\nThe little man in the uniform glanced at him, then back at his notebook.\n“New city ordinance about the parking of motorcars requires them to be left\nin an orderly manner, not up on the sidewalks like this.”\n“So…”\n“So I’m writing down the registry numbers of each one,” the man said.\n“And we’ll track down the owners and charge them a fine.”\nWayne whistled softly. “That’s evil.”\n“Nonsense,” the man said. “It’s the law.”"

This is a lot more productive, I’ll tell\nyou. It—”\n“That’s great,” Wayne said. “Whaddaya want for the book?”\nThe man regarded him. “It’s not for trade.”\n“I’ve got this here nice wallet,” Wayne said, holding it up, water dripping\nout the side. “Recently cleaned.”\n“Move along, sir,” the man said. “I am not—”\n“How ’bout this?” Wayne said, yanking out the knife.\nThe man jumped back in alarm, dropping his notebook. Wayne snatched\nit, dropping the knife.\n“Great trade. Thanks. Bye.” He took off at a dash.\n“Hey!” the man shouted, chasing after him. “Hey!”\n“No tradebacks!” Wayne shouted, hand on his wet hat, running for all he\nwas worth.\n“Come back here!”\nWayne dashed out onto the main street along the canal, passing a couple\nof old men sitting on a tenement’s steps near the entrance to the slums.\n“That’s Edip’s boy,” one of them said. “Always gettin’ himself into\ntrouble, that one is.”\nThe man got hit in the face by a meat bun a second later.\nWayne ignored that, holding his hat to his head and running all-out. The\nconner was a determined one. Followed Wayne a good ten streets before\nslowing, then stopping, hands on his knees. Wayne grinned and ducked\naround one last corner before slamming his back against the bricks of a\nbuilding, beside a window. He was pretty winded himself.\nHe’ll probably file a report, Wayne thought. Hope the fine they make Wax\npay ain’t too large.\nHe ought to find something to bring back as an apology. Maybe Wax\nneeded a wallet.\nWayne heard something beside him, and turned to see a woman with\nspectacles leaning out the window to look at him curiously. She was holding\na pen, and just inside the window a half-finished letter lay on the desk in\nfront of her. Perfect.\nWayne tipped his hat, snatching the pen from her hand. “Thanks,” he said,\nopening the notebook and scribbling some words. As she cried out, he tossed\nthe pen back to her, then continued on his way.\nThe final destination, the god’s dwelling, was not far now. He veered\ndown a street lined with trees and quaint smaller townhomes. He counted\nthem off, then turned to the right and stood facing it. The god’s new temple.\nShe’d moved here a few months ago.\nHe took a deep breath, banishing the music in his head. This had to be\nquiet. He crept carefully up the long walk to the front door. There, he quietly\ntucked the book into the spot between the doorknob and the door. He didn’t\ndare knock.

If the constables didn’t find a few\ncorpses on her doorstep every week, they’d start to wonder if she wasn’t\nfeeling well.\nWayne slipped away. He smiled, imagining Ranette’s reaction when she\nopened the door, and was so distracted that he almost ran right into Ranette\nherself walking up the path to her house.\nWayne stumbled back. Perfect brown hair, pulled back to expose a\ngorgeous face, weathered from her time in the Roughs. A fantastic figure,\nround in all the right places. Tall. Taller than Wayne. So he had something to\nlook up to.\n“Wayne! What were you doing at my door?”\n“I—”\n“Idiot,” she said, shoving past him. “You’d better not have broken in. Tell\nWax I delivered those cords to him just now. He needn’t have sent someone\nto check on me.”\n“Cords?” Wayne asked. What cords?\nShe ignored the question, muttering. “I swear, I am going to shoot you,\nyou little maggot.”\nHe watched her go, smiled to himself, then turned and continued walking\naway.\n“What’s this?” she said from behind him.\nHe kept walking.\n“Wayne!” she shouted at him. “I’ll shoot you, right now. I swear I will.\nTell me what you’ve done.”\nHe turned around. “It’s just a gift, Ranette.”\n“A notebook?” she asked, flipping the pages.\nHe shoved his hands into his trouser pockets and shrugged. “Writin’\nbook,” he said. “You’re always writin’ stuff down, thinkin’ about things.\nFigured if there’s one thing you could always use more of, it’s a writin’\nbook. All those ideas you have must get pretty crowded up there. Makes\nsense you’d need places to store them.”\n“Why’s it damp?”\n“Sorry,” he said. “Forgot and stuck it in my pocket for a moment. But I\ngot it right back out. I fought ten constables for that, I’ll have you know.”\nShe flipped through it, eyes narrowed in suspicion, until she reached the\nlast page. “What’s this?” She held it up close and read the words he’d\nscrawled on the back page. “‘Thank you and goodbye’? What’s wrong with\nyou?”\n“Nothin’s wrong,” Wayne said. “I just figured it was time.”\n“You’re leaving?”\n“For a little, but that’s not what the words mean. I’m sure we’ll see each\nother again. Perhaps frequently and such. I’ll see you … but I won’t be\nseein’ you again. See?”\nShe looked at him for a long moment, then seemed to relax. “You mean\nit?”\n“Yeah.”\n“Finally.”\n“Gotta grow up sometime, right? I’ve found that … well, a man wantin’\nsomething don’t make it true, you know?”\nRanette smiled. Seemed an awful long time since he’d seen her do that.\nShe walked to him, and he didn’t even flinch when she extended her hand.\nHe was proud of that.\nHe took her hand, and she raised his, then kissed it on the back. “Thank\nyou, Wayne.”"

One step into it, though, he\nhesitated, then shifted his weight to his other foot and leaned toward her\nagain. “Marasi says you’re courtin’ another girl.”\n“… I am.”\nWayne nodded. “Now, I don’t want to go wrong, seein’ as I’m being so\ngentlemanly and grown-up and the like. But you can’t blame a man for\ngettin’ ideas when hearing something such as that. So … I don’t suppose that\nthere’s a chance for the three of us to—”\n“Wayne.”\n“I don’t mind none if she’s fat, Ranette. I likes a girl what has something\nto hold on to.”\n“Wayne.”\nHe looked back at her, noting the storm in her expression. “Right,” he\nsaid. “Right. Okay. Yeah. I don’t suppose, when we’re lookin’ fondly on this\nconversationalizing and our memorable farewell, we could both just forget I\nsaid that last part?”\n“I’ll do my best.”\nHe smiled, took off his hat, and gave her a deep bow he’d learned off a\nsixth-generation doorman greeter at Lady ZoBell’s ballroom in the Fourth\nOctant. Then he stood up straight, replaced his hat, and put his back toward\nher. He found himself whistling as he went on his way.\n“What is that song?” she called after him. “I know it.”\n“‘The Last Breath,’” he said without turning back. “The pianoforte was\nplayin’ it when we first met.”\nHe turned the corner, and didn’t look back. Didn’t even check if she’d\nsighted on him with a rifle or something. Feeling a spring in his step, he\nmade his way to the nearest busy intersection and tossed the empty wallet\ninto the gutter. It wasn’t long before a carriage-for-hire pulled up, and its\ncoachman glanced to the side, saw the wallet, and scrambled down to grab it.\nDashing out from an alley, Wayne beat the man to it, diving for the wallet\nand rolling on the ground. “It’s mine!” he said. “I seen it first!”\n“Nonsense,” the coachman said, swatting Wayne with his horse reed. “I\ndropped it, you ruffian. It’s mine!”\n“Oh, is that so?” Wayne said. “How much is innit?”\n“I need not answer to you.”\nWayne grinned, holding up the wallet. “I tells you what. You can have it\nand everything that’s inside. But you take me to the Fourth Octant west train\nstation.”\nThe coachman eyed him, then held out his hand.\nHalf an hour later, the coach rolled up to the rail station—a bleak-looking\nbuilding with peaked towers and tiny windows, as if to taunt those trapped\ninside with a scant view of the sky. Wayne sat on the back footman’s stand,\nlegs swinging over the side.

Trains steamed nearby, rolling up to platforms to\ngorge themselves on a new round of passengers.\nWayne hopped down, tipped his hat to the grumbling coachman—who\nseemed well aware he’d been had—and strolled in through the open doors.\nHe shoved his hands in his pockets and looked about until he found Wax,\nMarasi, and Steris standing amid a small hill of suitcases, with servants\nwaiting at the ready to carry them.\n“Finally!” Wax snapped. “Wayne, our train is nearly boarding. Where\nhave you been?”\n“Makin’ an offering to a beautiful god,” Wayne said, looking up toward\nthe building’s high ceiling. “Why do you suppose they made this place so\nbig? Ain’t like the trains ever come in here, eh?”\n“Wayne?” Steris asked, wrinkling her nose. “Are you drunk?”\nHe put a bit of a slur into his speech. “Course not. Why … why’d I be\ndrunk at this hour?” He looked at her lazily.\n“You’re insufferable,” she said, waving to her lady’s maid. “I can’t believe\nyou risked being late for a little liquor.”\n“Wasn’t a little,” Wayne said.\nWhen the train arrived, he joined the others in climbing aboard—Steris\nand Wax had ordered an entire car set aside for the lot of them.\nUnfortunately, the last-minute hiring meant it had to be hitched all the way at\nthe back, and Wayne had to share a room with Herve the footman. Bugger\nthat. He knew for a fact the man snored. He’d find someplace else to sleep,\nor else just stay up. The train to New Seran wasn’t going to take that long.\nThey’d arrive before sunrise.\nIn fact, as the thing finally started to chug into motion, he swung out his\ncompartment’s window—much to Herve’s consternation—and climbed up\nonto the roof. He sat there whistling softly, watching Elendel pass for a time,\nwind ruffling his hair. A simple tune, easy and familiar, and the\naccompanying beat played on the tracks below. Ba-bum, ba-bum, ba-bum.\nQuick … energetic.\nHe lay down then, staring at the sky, the clouds, the sun.\nEyes forward, back turned toward the past.\nPART TWO\n5\nWatching the passing scenes, Wax was immediately struck by how\npopulated the land was south of Elendel.\nIt was easy to forget how many people lived in cities other than the\ncapital. The railway rolled along beside a river wide enough to swallow\nwhole towns up in the Roughs. Villages, towns, and even cities sprinkled the\nroute, so common that the train barely went five minutes without passing\nanother one. Between the towns, orchards stretched into the distance. Fields\nof wheat bowed and danced. Everything was green and vibrant, refreshed on\nevenings when the mists came out.\nWax turned from the window and dug into the package Ranette had sent\nhim. Inside, in a fitted, plush-lined case, was a large double-barreled\nshotgun. Beside it, in their own indentations, were three spheres each\nwrapped with a thin cord.\nThe spheres and cords he’d expected. The shotgun was a treat."

The shotgun was a treat.\nExperimenting with extra-powerful loads, a note read, and enormous\nslugs, for stopping Thugs or full-blooded koloss. Please test. Will require\nincreased weight on your part to fire. Recoil should be exceptional.\nRust and Ruin, the shells for this thing were almost as wide as a man’s\nwrist. It was like a cannon. He held one up as the train slowed into a station.\nIt wasn’t quite dark yet, but windows in the town were bright with\nelectricity.\nElectric lights. He lowered the shell, studying them. The outer cities had\nelectricity?\nOf course they do, idiot, he immediately thought to himself. Why\nwouldn’t they? He’d fallen into the same trap he’d once mocked others for.\nHe’d started to assume that anything important, trendy, or exciting happened\ninside Elendel. That sort of attitude had annoyed him when he’d lived in the\nRoughs.\nThe train yielded a handful of passengers and picked up fewer, which\nsurprised Wax, considering the crowded platform. Were they waiting for\nanother train? He leaned to the side to get a better look out the window.\nNo … the people were clumped together, listening to one of their number\nshout something Wax couldn’t hear. As he strained to read a sign one of the\npeople carried, someone threw an egg and it splatted right beside his\nwindow.\nHe pulled back. The train started up again, having waited only a fraction\nof the time it normally did at a stop. As it eased out of the station, more eggs\nflew toward it. Wax finally got a good look at the sign.\nEND ELENDEL OPPRESSION!\nOppression? He frowned, leaning as the train turned a bend, letting him\nwatch the crowd of people on the platform. A few hopped onto the tracks\nand shook fists.\n“Steris?” he asked, packing away Ranette’s box. “Have you paid attention\nto the outer cities situation?”\nNo reply came. He glanced toward his fiancée, who still sat across the\ncompartment from him, huddled in her seat with a blanket around her\nshoulders. She didn’t appear to have noticed the stop or the eggs; her face\nwas stuck so far into her book that snapping it closed would have caught her\nnose.\nLandre, the lady’s maid, had gone to ready Steris’s bed, and Wayne was\ndoing who knows what. So the two of them were alone in the room.\n“Steris?”\nNo reply. Wax cocked his head, trying to read the spine and make out\nwhat had her so fascinated, but she’d wrapped the volume in a cloth cover.\nHe inched to the side, and saw that her eyes were wide as she read. She\nturned the page quickly.\nWax frowned, rising and leaning across to get a view of one of the pages.\nSteris saw him, jumped, and snapped the book closed. “Oh!” she said. “Did\nyou say something?”\n“What are you reading?”\n“History of New Seran,” Steris said, tucking the book under her arm.\n“You looked shocked as you read.”"

        "text": "you say something?”\n“What are you reading?”\n“History of New Seran,” Steris said, tucking the book under her arm.\n“You looked shocked as you read.”\n“Well, I don’t know if you realize it, but the name Seran has a very\ndisturbing history. What did you want to ask me?”\nWax settled back. “I saw a crowd on the train platform. They seemed\nangry about Elendel.”\n“Oh, hum, yes. Let’s see. Outer cities … political situation.” She seemed\nto need a moment to compose herself. What had she read in that history that\nwas so disconcerting? “Well, I’m not surprised to hear of it. They aren’t\nhappy, for obvious reasons.”\n“You mean the taxation issues? They’re that upset?” He looked out the\nwindow, but they were too far away now for him to make out the crowd.\n“We only tax them a little, to maintain infrastructure and government.”\n“Well, they would argue that they don’t need our government, as they\nhave their own city administrations. Waxillium, many in the Basin feel that\nElendel is trying to act as if our governor were some kind of emperor—\nsomething that was supposed to have ended when the Lord Mistborn stepped\ndown after his century of rule.”\n“But our taxes don’t pay Governor Aradel,” Wax said. “They pay for\nthings like constables to police the docks and the maintenance of the railway\nlines.”\n“Technically that is correct,” Steris said. “But then all goods are also\ntaxed when they enter Elendel using the very railway lines and rivers we\nmaintain. Have you noticed that there are almost no railway lines traveling\ndirectly from city to city outside of Elendel? Other than the interchange at\nDoriel, everyone wishing to go from one outer city to another must go\ntoward Elendel. Want to ship something from Elmsdel to Rashekin? Have to\npass through Elendel. Want to sell metals in Tathingdwel? Have to pass\nthrough Elendel.”\n“A hub system makes perfect sense,” Wax said.\n“And it also lets us tax practically all goods shipped throughout the entire\nBasin,” Steris said. “By outer cities arguments, that means we’re taxing them\ntwice. First by our levies to maintain the railway lines, then a second time by\nmaking them pass everything through us. They’ve lobbied for years to get\nsome direct lines running around the Basin in a loop, and have always been\ndenied.”\n“Huh,” Wax said, settling back.\n“The rivers are just as bad,” Steris said. “We don’t control where they\nwere placed, of course. But they do all flow toward Elendel, so we control\nwater traffic. There are roadways between towns, but they’re horribly\ninefficient compared to water or rail travel, so Elendel tariffs basically set\nprices around the Basin. We can be certain that any goods produced in the\ncity are never undercut, and can provide incentives for things we don’t\nproduce to be sold at a discount in the city.”\nWax nodded slowly. He’d had an inkling, and had heard about the outer\ncities’ complaints. But he’d always read Elendel broadsheets on the matter;\nto hear it spelled out so directly by Steris made him marvel at his own\nshortsightedness."

Perhaps I should talk to Aradel about\nthis.”\n“Well, there are reasons Elendel does as it has.” Steris set her book aside\nand stood to get down a piece of luggage. Wax eyed the book, noting that\nshe’d marked her page. He reached toward it, but a sudden jerk by the train\nsent Steris sitting back down with a thump, and she set her suitcase on the\nbook. “Lord Waxillium?”\n“Sorry. Continue.”\n“Well, the governor and Senate are trying to maintain a single unified\nnation in the Basin, rather than letting it fracture into a bunch of city-states.\nThey’re using the economics to push the outer cities to accept centralized\nrule in exchange for lowered tariffs. Even Aradel, as a moderate liberal, has\naccepted that this is good for the Basin as a whole. Of course, the noble\nhouses don’t care so much about unity as reaping the benefits of a\nstranglehold on trade.”\n“And I assume I’ve benefited from these policies?”\n“Benefited?” Steris said. “You practically thrive on them, Lord Waxillium.\nYour textiles and metalworks would be undercut dramatically without these\ntariffs. You’ve voted for maintaining them twice and for raising them once.”\n“I … have?”\n“Well, I have,” Steris said. “You did tell me to see to your house’s\ninterests in voting at—”\n“Yes, I know,” Wax said, sighing.\nThe train rocked on its tracks, rhythmic thumps sounding from below.\nWax turned back to the window, but they weren’t passing a town at the\nmoment, and everything was growing dark. No mist tonight.\n“Is something wrong, Lord Waxillium?” Steris asked. “Whenever we\nspeak of politics or house finances, you grow distant.”\n“It’s because I’m a child sometimes, Steris,” Wax said. “Please, continue\nyour instruction. These are things I need to learn. Don’t let my foolishness\ndiscourage you.”\nSteris leaned forward and rested her hand on his arm. “These last six\nmonths have been difficult. You can be excused for letting your attention\ntoward politics lapse.”\nHe continued looking out the window. Following Lessie’s first death, he’d\nlost himself. He’d determined not to react that way again, and had thrown\nhis attention into working with the constables. Anything to keep him\noccupied, and to prevent him from lapsing into the same melancholy\ninactivity that had struck him when he’d first lost her.\n“I’ve still been a fool. And maybe there’s more. Steris, I’ve never had a\nmind for politics, even when I was trying to do my duty. It might be beyond\nme.”\n“In our months together, I’ve come to see you as a fiercely intelligent\nperson. The puzzles I’ve seen you solve, the answers I’ve seen you tease\nout … Why, they’re nothing short of remarkable. You are most certainly\ncapable of caring for your house. Begging your pardon, I’d say it is not your\nmind, but what you mind, that is the issue.”\nWax smiled, looking toward her. “Steris, you’re a delight. How could"

How could\nanyone ever think you dull?”\n“But I am dull.”\n“Nonsense.”\n“And when I asked you to help me review my list of preparations for the\ntrip?”\nThat list had been twenty-seven pages long. “I still can’t believe you got\nall those things into our bags.”\n“All of—” Steris blinked. “Lord Waxillium, I didn’t bring all of those\nthings.”\n“But you made a list.”\n“To think of everything we might need. I feel better when something goes\nwrong if I’ve contemplated that it might. At least this way, if we run into\nsomething we’ve forgotten, I can feel good knowing I figured we might need\nit.”\n“But if you didn’t bring all of that stuff, then what is in all those boxes? I\nsaw Herve struggling to lug a few of them up to the train.”\n“Oh,” Steris said, opening the suitcase she’d gotten down. “Why, our\nhouse finances, of course.”\nIndeed, inside was a large stack of ledgers.\n“This trip was unplanned,” Steris explained, “and I have to prepare an\naccountability report for the banks by next month. House Ladrian has\nrecovered for the most part from your uncle’s spending—but we need to\nmaintain strict books in order to convince lenders we’re solvent, so they will\nbe willing to work with us.”\n“We have accountants, Steris,” Wax said.\n“Yes, this is their work,” she said. “I need to check it over—you can’t\nsimply turn in someone else’s work without making certain the work was\ndone properly. Besides, they’re off three clips in this quarter’s financials.”\n“Three clips?” Wax said. “Out of how much money?”\n“Five million.”\n“They’re off three hundredths of a boxing,” Wax said, “out of five million.\nI’d say that’s not bad.”\n“Well, it’s within the thresholds the banks demand,” Steris said, “but it’s\nstill sloppy! These financials are how we represent ourselves to the world,\nLord Waxillium. If you want to overcome the impression people have of\nHouse Ladrian and its indulgences, you must agree that we have a\nresponsibility to present ourselves— You’re doing it again.”\nWax started, sitting up straighter. “Excuse me.”\n“Distant look in your eyes,” Steris noted. “Aren’t you the one who is\nalways talking about the responsibility men have to uphold the law?”\n“Different thing entirely.”\n“But your responsibility to your house—”\n“—is why I’m here, Steris,” Wax said. “Why I came back in the first\nplace. I recognize it. I acknowledge it.”\n“You just don’t like it.”\n“A man doesn’t have to like his duty. He just has to do it.”\nShe clasped her hands in her lap, studying him. “Here, let me show you\nsomething.” She rose, reaching for another suitcase on the rack above her\nseat.\nWax took her moment of distraction as a chance to slip the book she’d\nbeen reading out from its hiding place.

You were just acting so odd, and so\nfascinated by what was in the book—”\nShe groaned again.\nWax sat, awkward in the shaking train car, searching for words. “So …\nyou don’t have any … experience in these matters, I assume.”\n“I keep asking for details,” Steris said, slumping back into her seat and\nleaning her head back against the wall, looking up at the ceiling. “But\nnobody will tell me anything. ‘You’ll figure it out,’ they say with a wink and\na grin. ‘The body knows what to do.’ But what if mine doesn’t? What if I do\nit wrong?”\n“You could have asked me.”\n“Because that wouldn’t be embarrassing,” Steris said, closing her eyes. “I\nknow the basics; I’m not an idiot. But I need to provide an heir. It’s vital.\nHow am I supposed to do this properly if I don’t have any information? I\ntried to interview some prostitutes about it—”\n“Wait. You did?”\n“Yes. A trio of very nice young ladies; met them for tea, but they clammed\nup the moment they discovered who I was—they even got strangely\nprotective, and wouldn’t give me any details either. I get the impression they\nthought I was cute. What about being a spinster could possibly be cute? Do\nyou realize I’m almost thirty?”\n“One foot in the grave, obviously,” Wax said.\n“It’s easy to joke when you’re a man,” she snapped. “You’re not on a\ndeadline to provide something useful to this arrangement.”\n“You’re worth more than your ability to bear children, Steris.”\n“That’s right. There’s my money too.”\n“And all I am to this arrangement is a title,” Wax said. “It goes both\nways.”\nSteris settled back, breathing in and out through her teeth for a few\nmoments. Finally she cracked one eye. “You can shoot things too.”\n“What every proper lady needs in a man.”\n“Murdering is very traditional. Goes all the way back.”\nWax smiled. “Actually, if you want to be strictly traditional—going back\nto the Imperial Pair—it was the lady in the relationship who did the\nmurdering.”\n“Either way, I apologize for my tirade. It was completely uncalled for. I\nshall endeavor to be firmer with myself following our union.”\n“Don’t be silly,” Wax said. “I like seeing moments like this from you.”\n“You like it when ladies are in distress?”\n“I like it when you show me something new. It’s good to remember that\npeople have different sides.”"

It’s good to remember that\npeople have different sides.”\n“Well,” she said, taking the book, “I can continue my research at another\npoint. Our wedding has been delayed, after all.”\nThis was to be the night, he realized. Our first night of marriage. He’d\nknown, of course, but thinking about it made him feel … what? Relieved?\nSad? Both?\n“If it eases your mind,” Wax said as she tucked the book into her suitcase,\n“we won’t need to be … involved with any real frequency, particularly once\na child is provided. I don’t imagine your research will be necessary for more\nthan a dozen or so occasions.”\nAs he said it she wilted, shoulders slumping, head bowing. She was still\nfacing away from him, digging in her suitcase, but he spotted it immediately.\nDamn. That had been a stupid thing to say, hadn’t it? If Lessie had been\nhere, she’d have stomped on his toe for that one. He felt sick, then cleared\nhis throat. “That was injudicious of me, Steris. I’m sorry.”\n“The truth should never be the wrong thing to say, Lord Waxillium,” she\nsaid, straightening and looking toward him, composed once again. “This is\nexactly as our arrangement was to be, as I know full well. I did write the\ncontract.”\nWax crossed the train car, then sat next to her, resting his hand on hers. “I\ndon’t like this talk from you. Or from me. It’s become a habit for us to\npretend this relationship is nothing more than titles and money. But Steris,\nwhen Lessie died…” He choked off, then took a deep breath before\ncontinuing. “Everyone wanted to talk to me. Speak at me. Blather about how\nthey knew what I was feeling. But you just let me weep. Which was what I\nneeded more than anything. Thank you.”\nShe met his eyes, then squeezed his hand.\n“What we are together,” Wax said to her, “and what we make of our future\nneed not be spelled out by a piece of paper.” Or, well, a large stack of them.\n“The contract need not set our bounds.”\n“Pardon. But I thought that was exactly the purpose of a contract. To\ndefine and set bounds.”\n“And the purpose of life is to push our bounds,” Wax said, “to shatter\nthem, escape them.”\n“An odd position,” Steris said, cocking her head, “for a lawman.”\n“Not at all,” Wax said. He thought for a moment, then crossed to his side\nof the chamber again and dug into Ranette’s box, getting out one of the\nmetal spheres wound with a long cord. “Do you recognize this?”\n“I noticed you looking at it earlier.”\nWax nodded. “Third version of her hook device, like the one we used to\nclimb ZoBell Tower. Watch.”\nHe burned steel and Pushed on the sphere. It leaped from his fingers,\nstreaking toward the bar on the luggage rack, trailing the cord behind—\nwhich he held in his hand. As the sphere reached the rack, Wax Pushed on a\nspecific thin blue line revealed by his Allomantic senses. It pointed to a latch"

It pointed to a latch\nhidden inside the sphere, like the one inside Vindication that turned off the\nsafety.\nA hidden set of hooks deployed from the sphere. He tugged the cord, and\nwas pleased to find that it locked into place, catching on the luggage rack.\nWay more handy than the other designs, Wax thought, impressed. He\nPushed on the switch a second time, and the mechanism disengaged,\nretracting the hooks with a snap. The ball fell to the couch beside Steris, and\nWax pulled it into his hand by the cord.\n“Clever,” Steris said. “And this relates to the conversation how?”\nWax Pushed on the sphere again, but this time didn’t engage the\nmechanism. Instead he held the cord tight, giving the sphere about three feet\nof line. It jerked to a stop in midair, hovering. He kept Pushing, upward and\naway from him at an angle—but also held the cord, and that kept the sphere\nfrom falling.\n“People,” Wax said, “are like cords, Steris. We snake out, striking this way\nand that, always looking for something new. That’s human nature, to\ndiscover what is hidden. There’s so much we can do, so many places we can\ngo.” He shifted in his seat, changing his center of gravity, which caused the\nsphere to rotate upward on its tether.\n“But if there aren’t any boundaries,” he said, “we’d get tangled up.\nImagine a thousand of these cords, zipping through the room. The law is\nthere to keep us from ruining everyone else’s ability to explore. Without law,\nthere’s no freedom. That’s why I am what I am.”\n“And the hunt?” Steris asked, genuinely curious. “That doesn’t interest\nyou?”\n“Sure it does,” Wax said, smiling. “That’s part of the discovery, part of the\nsearch. Find who did it. Find the secrets, the answers.”\nThere was, of course, another part—the part Miles had forced Wax to\nadmit. There was a certain perverse anger that lawmen directed at those who\nbroke the law, almost a jealousy. How dare these people escape? How dare\nthey go the places nobody else was allowed to?\nHe let the sphere drop, and Steris picked it up, looking it over with a\nmeticulous eye. “You talk about answers, secrets, and the search. Why is it\nyou hate politics so much?”\n“Well, it might be because sitting in a stuffy room and listening to people\ncomplain is the opposite of discovery.”\n“No!” Steris said. “Every meeting is a mystery, Lord Waxillium. What are\ntheir motives? What quiet lies are they telling, and what truths can you\ndiscover?” She tossed his sphere back to him, then took her suitcase and set\nit on the small cocktail table in the center of the cabin. “House finances are\nthe same.”\n“House finances,” he said, flatly.\n“Yes!” Steris said. She fished in the suitcase, getting out a ledger. “See,\nlook.” She flipped it open and pointed at an account.\nHe looked at the page, then up at her. Such excitement, he thought. But …\nledgers?"

But …\nledgers?\n“Three clips,” he said. “The tables are different by three clips. I’m sorry,\nSteris, it’s a meaningless amount. I don’t see—”\n“It’s not meaningless,” she said, scooting over to sit beside him. “Don’t\nyou see? The answer is here somewhere, in this book. Aren’t you even\ncurious? The mystery of where they went?” She nodded to him, excited.\n“Well, I suppose you could show me how to look,” he said. He dreaded\nthe idea, but then, she looked so happy.\n“Here,” she said, handing him a ledger, then fishing out another. “Look at\ngoods received. Compare the dates and the payouts to the ledger! I’m going\nto study maintenance.”\nHe glanced toward the window in their door, half expecting Wayne to be\nout there in the hallway, snickering himself senseless at the prank. But\nWayne was not there. This was no prank. Steris grabbed her own ledgers and\nattacked them with as much ferocity as a hungry man might a good steak.\nWax sighed, sat back, and started looking through the numbers.\n6\nMarasi stopped on the image of the monster.\nIt was evening; people chatted softly around her in the dining car, and the\ntrain rolled around a picturesque bend, but for a moment she was transfixed\nby that image. A sketch of violent, rough lines that somehow conveyed a\nterrible dread. Most of the pages in the stack VenDell had delivered\ncontained transcripts of questions answered—or, more often, not answered\n—by the wounded kandra.\nThis was different. A wild sketch using two colors of pencil to depict a\nterrible visage. A burning red face, a distorted mouth, horns and spikes\nstreaking out along the rim. But black eyes, drawn like voids on the red skin.\nIt looked like a childhood terror ripped right out of a nightmare.\nThe bottom of the page had a caption. ReLuur’s sketch of the creature\ndescribed on 8/7/342. Yesterday.\nThe next page was an interview.\nVenDell: Describe to us again the thing you saw.\nReLuur: The beast.\nVenDell: Yes, the beast. It guarded the bracers?\nReLuur: No. No! It was before. Fallen from the sky.\nVenDell: The sky?\nReLuur: The darkness above. It is of the void. It has no eyes. It looks at\nme! It’s looking at me now!\nFurther questioning was delayed for an hour as ReLuur whimpered in the\ncorner, inconsolable. When he became responsive again, he drew this sketch\nwithout prompting, muttering about the thing he had seen. Something is\nwrong with the eyes of the creature. Perhaps spikes?\nSpikes. Marasi pulled her purse from under the table, digging into it as the\ncouple at the table behind her laughed loudly, calling for more wine. Marasi\npushed aside the two-shot pistol she had tucked inside and took out a thin\nbook, a copy of the one that Ironeyes had given to Waxillium.\nInside it she found the description she wanted, words written by the Lord"

        "text": "book, a copy of the one that Ironeyes had given to Waxillium.\nInside it she found the description she wanted, words written by the Lord\nMistborn, Lestibournes. So far as I’ve been able to figure out, Hemalurgy\ncan create practically anything by rewriting its Spiritual aspect. But hell,\neven the Lord Ruler had trouble getting it right. His koloss were great\nsoldiers—I mean, they could eat dirt and stuff to stay alive—but they\nbasically spent all day killing each other on a whim, and resented no longer\nbeing human. The kandra are better, but they turn to piles of goop if they\ndon’t have spikes—and they can’t reproduce on their own.\nI guess what I’m saying is that you shouldn’t experiment too much with\nthis aspect of Hemalurgy. It’s basically useless; there are a million ways to\nmess up for every one way there is to get a good result. Stick to transferring\npowers and you’ll be better off. Trust me.\nIt was so odd to read the Lord Mistborn’s words and have them sound so\ncasual. This was the Survivor of the Flames, the governor who had ruled\nmankind in benevolence for a century, guiding them on the difficult path to\nrebuild civilization. He sounded so normal. He even admitted in one section\nto having Breeze, Counselor of Gods, write most of his speeches for him. So\nall of the famous words, quotes, and inscriptions attributed to the Lord\nMistborn were fabrications.\nNot that he was a fool. No, the book was full of insight. Disturbing\ninsight. The Lord Mistborn advocated gathering the Metalborn who were\nelderly or terminally ill, then asking them to sacrifice themselves to make\nthese … spikes, which could in turn be used to create individuals of great\npower.\nHe made a good argument in the book. It wouldn’t have been so\ndisturbing if it had been easy to dismiss.\nShe studied the descriptions of Hemalurgic experiments in the book,\ntrying to ignore the loud couple behind her. Could this drawing be of a new\nkind of Hemalurgic monster, like those Wax had encountered under Elendel?\nDesigned by the Set, or perhaps the result of a failed experiment? Or was\nthis instead related to the continually ephemeral Trell, the god with an\nunknown metal?\nShe eventually put them aside and focused on her primary task. How to\nfind ReLuur’s spike? He’d been wounded in some kind of explosion that had\nripped off part of his body, and he’d been forced to flee, leaving the flesh—\nand the spike—behind.\nKandra flesh remained in its humanlike state once cut free of the body, so\nthose cleaning up after the explosion would have simply disposed of it,\nright? She needed to see if they’d created some kind of mass grave for\npeople killed in that explosion. Of course, if the Set knew what to look for in\na kandra’s corpse, they might have recovered the spike. The pictures—and\nthe possibility they were experimenting with Hemalurgy—made that more\nplausible. So that was another potential lead. And …\nAnd was that Wayne’s voice? Marasi turned to look at the laughing couple\nbehind her. Sure enough, Wayne had joined them, and was chatting amicably"

Sure enough, Wayne had joined them, and was chatting amicably\nwith the drunk pair, who wore fine evening attire. Wayne, as usual, was in\nRoughs trousers and suspenders, duster hung on the peg beside the table.\nHe saw Marasi and grinned, drinking a cup of the couple’s wine before\nbidding them farewell. The train hit a sharp bump, causing plates to rattle on\ntables as Wayne slid into the seat across from Marasi, his face full of grin.\n“Mooching wine?” Marasi asked.\n“Nah,” he said. “They’re drinking bubbly. Can barely stand the stuff. I’m\nmooching accents. Those folks, they’re from New Seran. Gotta get a feel for\nhow people talk there.”\n“Ah. You do realize it’s proper to remove your hat indoors, correct?”\n“Sure do.” He tipped his hat at her, then leaned back in his chair and\nsomehow got his booted feet up on the small table. “What’re you doin’ in\nhere?” he asked.\n“The dining car?” Marasi asked. “I just wanted a place to spread out.”\n“Wax rented us out an entire train car, woman,” Wayne said, pointing at a\npassing waiter, then pointing at his mouth and making a tipping motion.\n“We’ve got like six rooms or somethin’ all to ourselves.”\n“Maybe I simply wanted to be around people.”\n“And we ain’t people?”\n“That is subject to some dispute in your case.”\nHe grinned, then winked at her as the waiter finally stepped over.\n“You wanted—” the waiter began.\n“Liquor,” Wayne said.\n“Would you care to be a little more specific, sir?”\n“Lots of liquor.”\nThe waiter sighed, then glanced at Marasi, and she shook her head.\n“Nothing for me.”\nHe moved off to obey. “No bubbly!” Wayne shouted after him, earning\nhim more than one glare from the car’s other occupants. He then turned to\neye Marasi. “So? Gonna answer my question? What’re you hidin’ from,\nMarasi?”\nShe sat for a moment, feeling the rhythmic rattle of the train’s motion.\n“Does it ever bother you to be in his shadow, Wayne?”\n“Who? Wax? I mean, he’s been putting on weight, but he’s not that fat yet,\nis he?” He grinned, though that faded when she didn’t smile back. And, in an\nuncharacteristic moment of solemnity, he slid his boots off the table and\nrested one elbow on it instead, leaning toward her.\n“Nah,” he said after some thought. “Nah, it doesn’t. But I don’t care much\nif people look at me or not. Sometimes my life is easier if they ain’t looking\nat me, ya know? I like listening.” He eyed her. “You’re sore that he thought\nyou couldn’t do this on your own?”\n“No,” she said. “But … I don’t know, Wayne.

At the precinct, when I accomplish\nsomething, everyone assumes I had Waxillium’s help. Sometimes it’s like\nI’m no more than an appendage.”\n“You’re not that at all, Marasi,” Wayne said. “You’re important. You help\nout a lot. Plus you smell nice, and not all bloody and stuff.”\n“Great. I have no idea what you just said.”\n“Appendages don’t smell nice,” Wayne said. “And they’re kinda gross. I\ncut one outta a fellow once.”\n“You mean an appendix?”\n“Sure.” He hesitated. “So…”\n“Not the same thing.”\n“Right. Thought you was makin’ a metaphor, since people don’t need one\nof those and all.”\nMarasi sighed, leaning back and rubbing her eyes with the heels of her\nhands. Why was she discussing this with Wayne again?\n“I understand,” he said. “I know what you’re feeling, Mara. Wax … he’s\nkind of overwhelming, eh?”\n“It’s hard to fault him,” Marasi said. “He’s effective, and I don’t think he\neven knows that he’s being overbearing. He fixes things—why should I be\nupset about that? Rusts, Wayne, I studied his life, admiring what he did. I\nshould feel lucky to be part of it. And I do, mostly.”\nWayne nodded. “But you want to be your own person.”\n“Exactly!”\n“Nobody’s forcing you to stay with us,” Wayne noted. “As I recall, Wax\nspent a lot of effort at first trying to keep you from always gettin’ involved.”\n“I know, I know. I just … Well, this once I was thinking for a time that I\nmight be able to do something important on my own.” She took a deep\nbreath, then let it out. “It’s stupid, I know, but it still feels frustrating. We’ll\ndo all this work, find that spike, and get back to the kandra—then they’ll\nthank Waxillium.”\nWayne nodded thoughtfully. “I knew this fellow once,” he said, leaning\nback again, feet on the table, “who thought it would be a good idea to take\npeople huntin’. City folk, you know? Who ain’t never seen an animal larger\nthan a rat what ate too much? Out in the Roughs, we got lions. Fierce things,\nwith lotsa teeth an—”\n“I know what a lion is, Wayne.”\n“Right.

Broke his hand up right good, and\nhe can’t bend the tips of his fingers no more.”\nHis drink arrived—a bottle of whiskey and a small cup. He took it, telling\nthe waiter to charge Waxillium, then poured some and settled back.\n“Is that the end?” Marasi asked.\n“What?” Wayne said. “You want more to happen to the poor fellow? Right\nsadistic of you, Marasi. Right sadistic.”\n“I didn’t mean…” She took a deep breath. “Did that have any relevance to\nthe situation I’m in?”\n“Not really,” Wayne said, taking a drink, then removing a little wooden\nbox from his pocket and getting out a ball of gum. “But I tell ya, Chip, he\nhas it really bad. Whenever I’m thinkin’ my life is miserable, I remember\nhim, and tell myself, ‘Well, Wayne. At least you ain’t a broke, dickless feller\nwhat can’t even pick his own nose properly.’ And I feels better.”\nHe winked at her, popped the gum in his mouth, then slipped away from\nthe table. He waved to MeLaan, who was wearing a fine lace gown and\noversized hat. A normal woman would have needed quite the corset to pull\noff the outfit, but the kandra had probably just sculpted her body to fit.\nWhich was horribly unfair.\nMarasi stared at the notes. Wayne had left her feeling confused, which\nwas not unusual, but perhaps there was wisdom in what he said. She dug\nback into the research, but it wasn’t too long before she started to droop. It\nwas getting late, the sun having fully set outside, and they wouldn’t arrive\nfor another few hours. So she packed up the stack of pages inside their large\nfolder.\nAs she did, something slipped out of the folder. Marasi frowned, holding\nit up. A small cloth pouch. Opening it revealed a small Pathian earring and a\nnote.\nJust in case, Waxillium.\nShe yawned, tucking it away, and pushed out of the dining car. The private\ncar Waxillium had hired for them was two cars back, at the tail end of the\ntrain. She held tight to the sheets as she stepped onto the open-air platform\nbetween cars, wind whipping at her. A short railman stood here, and eyed her\nas she crossed to the next car.

Waxillium she had expected, but late\nnights were not Steris’s thing.\nMarasi slid open the door, peeking in. “Waxillium?”\nThe man knelt on the floor, his seat covered in ledgers and sheets of paper.\nEyes intent on one of them, he held up his hand toward her in a quieting\ngesture as she started to ask what he was doing.\nMarasi frowned. Why—\n“Aha!” Waxillium proclaimed, standing up. “I found it!”\n“What?” Steris said. “Where?”\n“Tips.”\n“I looked in tips.”\n“One of the dockworkers turned the request in late,” Waxillium said,\ngrabbing a sheet and spinning it toward Steris. “He tipped a dock boy four\nclips to run a message for him, and asked for reimbursement. Dockmaster\ngave it to him, and filed a note, but he wrote the four like a three and the\naccountants recorded it that way.”\nSteris looked it over with wide eyes. “You bastard,” she said, causing\nMarasi to blink. She’d never heard language like that from Steris. “How did\nyou figure this out?”\nWaxillium grinned, folding his arms. “Wayne would say it’s because I’m\nbrilliant.”\n“Wayne has the mental capacity of a fruit fly,” Steris said. “In comparison\nto him, anyone is brilliant. I…” She trailed off, noticing Marasi for the first\ntime. She blinked, and her expression became more reserved. “Marasi.\nWelcome. Would you like to sit?”\n“On what?” Marasi asked. Every surface was covered in ledgers and\npages. “The luggage rack? Are those house finances?”\n“I found a lost clip,” Waxillium said. “The last one, I should add, which\ngives me two for the evening, while Steris found one.”\nMarasi stared at Steris, who started clearing a place for her to sit. She\nlooked to Waxillium, who stood beaming with the sheet in his hand, looking\nit over again as if it were some lost metal he’d rescued from a labyrinth.\n“A lost clip,” Marasi said. “Great. Maybe you can find something in\nthese.” She held up the pages VenDell had given her. “I’m heading to bed for\na few hours.”\n“Hmm?” Waxillium said. “Oh, sure. Thanks.” He set down the page with\nsome reluctance, taking the folder.\n“Be sure to look at the drawings of monsters,” Marasi said, yawning. “Oh,\nand this was in there.” She tossed him the pouch with the earring and walked\nback into the hallway.\nShe walked toward her room, feeling the train slow once more.

She gaped for a moment, and then the door at\nthe other end of the car burst open.\nThe man standing on the platform beyond leveled a gun down the corridor\nand fired.\n7\n“Well, I think you showed a real talent for this, Lord Waxillium, as I believe\nI suggested—”\nWax stopped listening to Steris.\nTrain slowing.\nChugging sounds retreating.\nDoor opening.\nWax burned steel.\nSteris continued talking, and he nodded absently, part of him going\nthrough the motions as the rest of him came alert.

He\nrammed into the wall where he’d Pushed the bullet, Vindication in hand, and\ndrilled the surprised man at the end of the hallway in the forehead.\nMarasi clipped off a scream. Steris stuck her head out into the hallway,\nwide-eyed. Not the smartest move, but she’d rarely been in gunfights.\n“Thanks,” Marasi said.\nHe nodded curtly. “Get your sister behind some cover.” He slipped past\nher and stepped out onto the small platform between train cars—only, their\ncar had been unhooked and left to drift. A group of three shocked-looking\nmen on horses rode alongside the slowing car.\nHorses? Wax thought. Really?\nBy the starlight—which was bright tonight, with no clouds and the Red\nRip low on the horizon—he could see they wore vests over their shirts and\nsturdy trousers. A larger crowd of them galloped alongside the train ahead.\nThis wasn’t a specific attack on just his car, but a full-blown armed robbery.\nThat meant he had to be quick.\nHe shoved on the platform beneath him and decreased his weight. The\nthree robbers nearby started firing, but Wax’s Push flung him into the air\nabove their shots and his decreased weight meant that the wind resistance\npushed him backward, onto the train car. He landed, increased his weight,\nand picked one man off his horse.\nThe remaining bandits took off forward, kicking their horses and chasing\nafter the others, yelling, “Allomancer! Allomancer!”\nBlast, Wax thought, dropping one of the men as the other dodged his horse\ninto a stand of trees. He was out of pistol range in a moment, and would\nsoon catch his fellows.\nWax dropped onto the platform and rushed down the hallway. The room"

The room\nhe’d shared with Steris was empty, but he spotted quivering blue lines in the\none next door. Marasi had wisely piled everyone into the servants’\ncompartment.\n“Robbery,” Wax said as he threw open the door, startling the servants,\nMarasi, and Steris. Most of them sat on the floor, though Marasi was by the\nwindow, peeking out. And Steris was on the built-in seat, remarkably\ncomposed.\n“Robbers?” Steris asked. “Really, Lord Waxillium, must you bring your\nhobbies with you everywhere we go?”\n“They’re going after the rest of the train,” Wax said, pointing. “The first\nthieves must have recognized this car as a private one, probably lush with\nriches to plunder, and so they uncoupled it. But something is wrong.”\n“Other than people trying to kill us?” Marasi asked.\n“No,” Steris said, “in my experience, that’s quite normal.”\n“What’s wrong,” Wax said, “is that they’re riding horses.”\nThe others stared at him.\n“Horseback train robberies,” Wax said, “are something out of the story\nmagazines. Nobody actually does that. What good does it do to board a\nmoving train, risking your life, when you can just stop the vehicle like the\nVanishers did?”\n“So our bad guys…” Marasi said.\n“New to this,” Wax said. “Or they’ve been reading too much cheap\nfiction. Either way, they’re still going to be dangerous. I can’t risk leaving\nyou here, in case they come back for you. So keep your heads down and\nhang on.”\n“Hang on?” Herve said. “Why—”\nWax ducked back out into the hallway and ran to the back end of the car.\nAfter checking out the doorway, he jumped onto the tracks behind the\nprivate car, which was finally rolling to a stop. Then he tapped his\nmetalminds and increased his weight.\nA lot.\nThe gravel sank under his feet as his body became increasingly heavy. He\ngritted his teeth, flared his metal, and Pushed.\nThe car lurched in place as if another train had crashed into it. His Push\nsent it rattling along the tracks, and Wax let out his breath. His muscles\ndidn’t hurt, but he felt as if he’d slammed into a wall.\nHe released his metalmind, returning his weight to normal, and Pushed on\nthe rails to pull himself out of the gravel. He almost lost a boot in the\nprocess.\nHe Pushed against the tracks once more, sending himself chasing after the\nmoving car. Not nearly fast enough, he thought as he dropped to the ground\nand increased his weight again. The car rocked as he shoved it, then he\nhopped and followed, repeating the process three more times to get it up to\nspeed. Then finally he Pushed himself all the way up to it, jamming his\nshoulder against the back wall and using Allomancy on the tracks behind to\nsustain and increase the momentum.\nGround passed behind in a blur, rows and rows of wooden ties, the steel\nrails with a continuous stream of metal lines that pointed toward Wax’s"

He groaned, and moved so his back was toward the wall. Still, the\nPushing threatened to crush him, as he couldn’t increase his weight here\nmuch or risk ripping up the tracks.\nThey shot past a group of horses with a few youths guarding them—the\nbandits’ extra mounts. Wax raised Vindication and fired a few shots into the\nair, but the horses were too well trained to spook at the sound.\nHe redoubled his Push as he thought he heard gunfire ahead of him. A\nmoment later, his car slammed into the train proper. Wax let go, dropping to\nthe platform, his back aching. The couplers had engaged, however, and the\ncar remained attached to the rest of the train.\nHe peeked into the car, then ducked in, passing the room where the others\nwere hiding. In his own compartment, he dropped Vindication into her\nholster, then yanked his gun case off the top rack.\n“Waxillium?” Marasi said, slipping into the room.\n“You seen Wayne?” Wax asked.\n“He was in the dining car a little bit ago.”\n“He’ll be fighting already. If you see him, let him know I’m going to hit\nthe front of the train, then sweep backward.” Wax snapped one Sterrion\nclosed, now loaded, then reached for the second.\n“Got it,” Marasi said. She hesitated. “You’re worried.”\n“No masks.”\n“No…”\n“Robbers wear masks,” Wax said. He clicked the second Sterrion closed,\nthen buckled on his gunbelt. Vindication, after a reload, went back into his\nshoulder holster.\n“And men who don’t wear masks?”\n“They don’t care if they’re seen.” He looked over and met her eyes.\n“They’re already outlaws, and don’t have anything to lose. Men like that kill\neasily. What’s more, it’s obvious to me that they’ve never tried a train\nrobbery before. Either they are very, very desperate—or someone put them\nup to this.”\nShe paled. “You don’t think the attack is a coincidence.”\n“If it is, I’ll eat Wayne’s hat.” He eyed the shotgun Ranette had given him,\nthen tied on his thigh holster and slipped it in. Then he hung two of her cord-\nand-sphere contraptions from his gunbelt. Finally, he reached up and took a\nrifle bag off the top shelf and tossed it to Marasi.\n“Watch Steris,” he said. “See if you can find Wayne; check on the next car\nor two, but don’t worry about advancing farther if you meet resistance. Just\nhold your ground and protect these people.”\n“Right.”\nHe moved toward the hallway, but as soon as he stepped out a hail of\ngunfire drove him back again. He cursed. All it would take was one\naluminum bullet—which he couldn’t Push on—and he’d be dead.\nHe took a deep breath, then glanced out quickly while Pushing, and\ncounted four bandits on the rear platform of the next car forward.\nThey fired again.

He ducked back and watched the blue lines of bullets as\nthey flew, taking chunks of wood paneling off the wall and splintering his\ndoorframe. It didn’t appear that any of the bullets were aluminum.\n“Distraction?” Marasi asked.\n“Yes, please,” Wax said, increasing his weight and Pushing on the window\nframe, launching it out of the side of the car and against a passing tree. “Fire\na few times as I leave, then give me a count of twenty, followed by a\ndistraction.”\n“Will do.”\nWax threw himself out the window. Immediately he fired Vindication\ndownward, burying a bullet in the ground and giving him something to Push\non to launch himself upward. Marasi fired a few quick shots inside, and\nhopefully the robbers would assume his shot had been inside as well.\nSoaring high, wind whipping at his hair and suit coat, he shot a second\nbullet into the ground, but farther out, and used it to nudge himself to the\nright—placing him above the train.\nHe didn’t let himself touch down, instead using a Push on the nails in the\ntrain roof to keep flying forward. He soared over his own car and the one the\nrobbers were in, finally landing on the dining car, which was third from the\nback.\nAs he turned to face the rear, his mental count hit twenty. A second later,\nhe heard a spray of gunfire coming from Marasi. That was his mark; Wax\ndropped between the dining car and the robbers’ car.\nHe fell practically on top of one of the robbers, who was backing out of\nthe second car from the end—which he hadn’t expected. Wax leveled his\ngun, but the surprised man punched him in the gut.\nWax grunted, increasing his weight. The platform beneath him strained,\nbut when he shoved the robber with his shoulder, it sent the man tumbling\ntoward the tracks. The robber had kindly left the door open for him, and he\nhad a clean shot at the backs of his fellows at the far end, who were focused\non Marasi in the last train car beyond.\nWax didn’t shoot; he just Pushed on the metal they were carrying. The\nmen flipped off the rear platform, dropping into the space between cars. One\ncaught the railing. Wax shot him in the arm, then turned, leveling his gun\ntoward the dining car.\nPeople cringed inside, hiding under tables, whimpering. Rusts … Without\nbandanas or identifying marks to watch for, he’d have trouble spotting the\nbandits. He set up his steel bubble, a faint Push away from himself in all\ndirections that excluded his own weapons. It was far from perfect—he’d\nbeen shot several times while using it—but it did help.\nHe turned and strode into the second car from the back, the one the\nrobbers had been using, checking for hostiles at each door, his steel bubble\nrattling doorknobs. First-class passengers were hiding here, and none\nappeared hurt.\nIn Wax’s car, Marasi ducked out of the room, carrying one of Wax’s\nfavorite hats. She shrugged apologetically at its numerous holes."

She shrugged apologetically at its numerous holes.\n“If I find Wayne, I’ll send him to you,” he told her, reaching to his gunbelt\nfor a metal vial. He came up with wet fingers, and his belt clinked with\nbroken glass.\nDamn. The robber who’d slugged him had broken his vials. He hurriedly\nhopped over the space between cars, entering their private car again. “I need\nmetal,” he explained at Marasi’s inquisitive look.\nHe stepped up to his room, then hesitated as a hand stuck out of the next\nroom down, holding a small vial.\n“Steris?” he said, walking to her. She was still sitting on the plush train\nbench—though her face was paler than before. “Steel flakes in suspension,”\nshe said, wiggling the vial.\n“Since when have you carried one of these?” Wax asked, taking it from\nher.\n“Since about six months ago. I put one into my purse in case you might\nneed it.” She raised her other hand, displaying two more. “I carry the other\ntwo because I’m neurotic.”\nHe grinned, taking all three. He downed the first one, then nearly choked.\n“What the hell is in this?”\n“Other than steel?” Steris asked. “Cod-liver oil.”\nHe looked at her, gaping.\n“Whiskey is bad for you, Lord Waxillium. A wife must look out for her\nhusband’s health.”\nHe sighed and drank one more, then tucked the last into his gunbelt. “Stay\nsafe. I’m going to scout the train.” He left and threw himself out the end\ndoor, Pushing on the tracks and launching himself in a high arc upward.\nThe land spread before him, bathed in starlight. The southern end of the\nBasin, approaching the Seran mountain range, was far more varied in\ngeography than the northern portion. Here, hills rolled across the land, which\nslowly increased in elevation.\nThe Seran River cut a strikingly straight path through the hills, often\nhaving carved out gorges and canyons. The train line stayed up higher,\nhugging the tops of hillsides, though its path required it to cut two or three\ntimes across the river on large latticework bridges.\nThe train consisted of eight passenger cars, several cargo cars, and a\ndining car. He let himself drop, focusing on a specific car near the front\nwhere gunshots sounded. As he landed just behind that car, someone\nstumbled out onto the platform, holding his face.\nArmed bank guard, he thought, noting the man’s uniform. The train was\nbringing a payroll shipment inside a courier car disguised as if carrying a\nmore mundane cargo. What was that scent in the air? Formaldehyde? The\nguard was gasping, and soon another stumbled out after him.\nBoth fell a moment later to gunfire from inside the courier car. Wax\ndropped down onto the platform beside the fallen men, checking on them.\nOne was still moving; Wax knelt and moved the man’s hand to cover the\nhole in his shoulder. “Press hard,” he said over the sounds of the thumping\ntrack. “I’ll be back for you.”"

Wax took a deep breath and stepped into the\ncourier car, where his eyes immediately started burning. Men moved inside,\nwearing strange masks and working at a large safe in the center. Half a\ndozen dead guards lay strewn across the floor of the car.\nWax started shooting, flooring several of the robbers, then Pushed himself\nout again, then upward as the others took cover and started firing back. He\nlanded on the car behind the courier car, holstered Vindication—who was\nout of bullets—and brought out a Sterrion.\nHe prepared to drop down to try picking off more robbers, but an\nexplosion inside the courier car interrupted him. It was a small blast, as\nexplosions went, but it still left Wax’s ears ringing. He winced and dropped\nto the platform, noticing figures moving in the smoke, stooping beside the\nsafe, removing its contents. Others started firing at him.\nHe ducked to the side, then Pushed the door to the courier car closed,\nblocking the gunfire with the reinforced metal door. He grabbed the\nwounded guard under the arms and pulled him backward over the small gap\nbetween platforms and into the passenger car behind. This was another car\nwith private compartments, though second-class, where those rooms had\nbeen filled with larger groups.\nIt was currently empty; the passengers, hearing the gunfire in the next car,\nhad fled down the train. He checked each room anyway. Afterward, he\npropped the wounded man against the wall inside one of the rooms and tied\na handkerchief around the wound, pulling it tight.\n“The money…” the guard said.\n“They’ve got the money,” Wax replied. “Stopping them isn’t worth risking\nany more lives.”\n“But…”\n“I got a good look at several of them,” Wax said, “and hopefully so did\nyou. We’ll give descriptions, chase them down, set a trap on our terms.\nBesides, if they leave now, there might be time to help a few of your friends\nin there.”\nThe guard nodded weakly. “Couldn’t stop them. They threw bottles\nthrough the windows.… And then the doors ripped off. Steel doors, Pushed\ninto the room, twisted off their hinges like they were paper…”\nWax felt a chill. So the bandits had Metalborn too. Wax peeked around the\nwall back toward the courier car, and found the door he’d closed open again.\nA thin man stood on the platform, wearing a long coat and supporting\nhimself on a cane. He gestured, speaking urgently and motioning for another\nbandit to lumber toward Wax’s car—a hulking brute who had to be almost\nseven feet tall.\nWonderful. “Get in here,” Wax said to the guard, pulling open the luggage\ncompartment in the room’s floor. “Keep your head down.”\nThe guard crawled into the compartment, which was cramped and\nshallow, but large enough for a person, even with a few pieces of luggage in\nit.

Did the engineer not know about the attack, or was he hoping to get\nto the next town?\nRusts, the courier car changed all of Wax’s assessments. Maybe this\nwasn’t about him. But why not simply stop the train and raid it in the\nwilderness? Too many questions, and no time to answer them. He had a\nbandit to kill. He’d have to jump out and surprise the brute, bring him down\nquick. If he was the Metalborn, surprise would be—\nSomething bounced down the hallway and came to a rest on the floor\nbeside Wax, just outside the doorway in which he crouched. A small metal\ncube. He jumped back, fearing an explosive, but nothing happened. What\nhad that been?\nAnd then he realized with a deep, bone-chilling horror that he was no\nlonger burning metal. There was nothing inside of him to burn.\nHis steel reserves had—somehow—vanished.\n* * *\nMarasi fired three shots with the rifle, driving the bandits in the next car back\nunder cover. Impressive, she thought, absently handing the weapon to Steris\nfor reloading. She’d always used a target rifle before. You took one shot at a\ntime with those, cocking between, but Waxillium’s rifle had a wheel full of\ncartridges that turned on its own, like a revolver.\nSteris handed back the gun, and Marasi took aim again, waiting for any\nbandit bits to peek out. She hid just inside the door to the servants’\ncompartment, and the bandits hadn’t made any serious attempts at advancing\non her position.\nSomeone said something beside her. Marasi glanced into the room, where\nDrewton was speaking. Marasi pulled out one of her wax earplugs.\n“What?” she asked.\n“Are those earplugs?” the valet asked.\n“What do they look like?” she said, then sighted down the rifle and fired a\nshot.\nDrewton shoved his hands over his ears. Indeed, in the small chamber, the\nshot was loud enough that she was annoyed he’d made her remove her\nearplug.\n“You carry them with you?” Drewton asked.\n“Steris does.” Apparently. Marasi had been a little surprised when Steris\nhad pulled out a pair for herself, then—an unconcerned look on her face—\nhanded a pair to Marasi.\n“So you expected this to happen?”\n“More or less,” Marasi said, watching for movement from the bandits.\nHe seemed aghast. “This sort of thing happens often?”\n“Would you say it happens often, Steris?” Marasi asked.\n“Hmm?” Steris said, removing an earplug. “What was that?”\nMarasi fired a shot, then looked up. Think I winged that one. “The valet\nwants to know if this sort of thing happens often to us.”\n“You more than me,” Steris said conversationally. “But when Lord\nWaxillium is around, things do tend to pop up.”\n“Things?” Drewton said. “Pop up? This is a rusting train robbery!”\nSteris regarded the valet with a cool expression. “Didn’t you inquire about"

This is a rusting train robbery!”\nSteris regarded the valet with a cool expression. “Didn’t you inquire about\nyour prospective master before entering Lord Waxillium’s employ?”\n“Well, I mean, I knew he had an interest in the constabulary. Like some\nlords have an interest in the symphony, or in civic matters. It seemed odd,\nbut not ungentlemanly. I mean, it’s not as if he was involved in the theater.”\nThey’ve gone quiet over there, Marasi thought, nervously tapping one\nfinger against the rifle barrel. Were they going to try to cross over onto the\ntop of her car again? One of the holes in the ceiling still dripped blood from\nthe previous attempt.\nTo the side, Steris clicked her tongue disapprovingly at Drewton’s words.\nHe hadn’t done his homework, which was a dreadful sin in Steris’s eyes.\nLittle could be worse than entering a situation without being thorough.\n“Is … is he going to come back?” Drewton asked.\n“Once he’s finished,” Steris said.\n“Finished with what?”\n“Killing the rest of them, hopefully,” she said.\nMarasi found herself surprised at Steris’s bloodthirst. Of course, the\nwoman hadn’t been quite the same since her kidnapping eighteen months\nback. It wasn’t that Steris acted traumatized—but she’d changed.\n“They aren’t trying to get to us anymore,” Drewton said. “Did they\nretreat?”\n“Maybe,” Marasi said. Probably not.\n“Should we go look?” Drewton asked.\n“We?”\n“Well, you.” He tugged at his collar. “Gunfights. I had not actually\nexpected gunfights. Aren’t the servants usually left out of such\nextravagances?”\n“Most of the time,” Marasi said.\n“Except when the house blew up,” Steris added.\n“Except then.”\n“And … you know,” Steris said.\n“Best not to mention it.”\n“Mention what?” Drewton asked.\n“Don’t worry about it,” Marasi said, glaring at Steris. Honestly. If the man\ncouldn’t do a little research before taking a job—\n“Wait,” Drewton said, frowning. “What exactly happened to Lord\nLadrian’s previous valet?”\nMotion in the hallway again. Marasi snapped her rifle up, ready to fire.\nHowever, the person who moved out into the hallway wasn’t one of the\nbandits, but an older woman in a fine traveling dress. A bandit walked\nbehind her, gun to her head.\nMarasi shot him right in the forehead.\nShe gaped, shocked at herself, and almost dropped the gun. Fortunately\nthe remaining bandit—seeing that the ploy hadn’t worked—ran out of the\ncar, fleeing toward the front of the train.\nRusts! Marasi felt sweat trickle down her temple. She’d fired so quickly,\nwithout even thinking. The poor hostage stood there, blood from the dead\nman all over her. Marasi knew what that felt like. Yes, she did.\nBeside her, Drewton let out a few oaths that would have made Harmony\nblush. “What were you thinking?” he demanded of her. “You could have hit\nthe woman.”"

Marasi stood over the bandit corpse, then looked back out at the\nroof of her car, where another one lay. She hated this part. A year and a half\nworking with Waxillium hadn’t made killing any easier. It was unnerving,\nand it was such a waste! If you had to shoot a man, society had already\nfailed.\nMarasi steeled herself and did a quick check of the rooms of the first-class\ncar, determining that the bandits had well and truly retreated. One of the\nfirst-class passengers claimed to have experience with a gun, and she handed\nhim the rifle and set him watching to be certain no bandits returned.\nFrom there she went to the dining car, checking on the passengers,\ncalming them. Gunshots came from farther up the train. Waxillium was\ndoing his job. His effective, brutal job. The next car up—fourth from the end\n—was a second-class car, with packed rooms. She checked on the people\nhere too.\nBetween the two cars, she found four people who had been shot. One was\ndead, another seriously wounded, so Marasi went to see if Steris had, by\nchance, brought any bandages or medical equipment. The chances were\nslim, but this was Steris. Who knew what she had planned for?\nMarasi passed Drewton, who sat morosely on a seat in one of the first-\nclass cabins, obviously wondering how an expert cravat-tier had ended up in\nthe middle of a virtual war zone. Steris, however, wasn’t in the servants’\ncompartment. Nor was she in the one she had been sharing with Waxillium.\nIncreasingly frantic, Marasi searched through the first-class rooms. No\nSteris. Finally, she thought to ask the man she’d posted on guard.\n“Her?” he said. “Yes, miss. She went by here a few minutes ago, moving\nup the train. Should I have stopped her? She seemed very determined about\nsomething.”\nMarasi groaned. Steris must have slipped past while she was checking in\nthe rooms of the second-class car. Frustrated, she took her rifle back and\nchased after her sister.\n* * *\nWax’s metal reserves were gone.\nWax knelt, completely stunned. This was impossible. How in Harmony’s\nname?\nHe twisted, discovering that the enormous bandit had stepped into this car.\nDoors rattled around the man, shaking as if someone were trying violently to\nget out. Wax ducked into the hallway and lifted his gun, but it was flipped\nfrom his fingers by a Push. Immediately after, Wax himself was shoved\nbackward by his gunbelts. He slammed into the opposite wall of the car,\nright next to the closed door leading toward the back of the train.\nHe groaned in pain. How? How had they…?"

The giant’s next right hook caught him as he\ntried to jab for the face.\nHis vision flashed, and his cheek erupted in pain. The blow shoved him\ninto the side wall. Rusts! Where was Wayne? The brute came in again, and\nWax dodged to the side, barely, and managed to connect with the man’s face.\nOnce, twice, three quick jabs.\nThe brute smiled. Doors still rattled around him—he was a Coinshot,\nobviously, Pushing out with a bubble like the one Wax used. It even pressed\na little on the metalminds Wax wore on his upper arms, which were resistant\nto Allomancy.\nThis man could have ended the fight at any moment by grabbing a bit of\nmetal and shooting it. He preferred the hand-to-hand fight. Indeed, the man\nraised his fists and nodded to Wax, still grinning, inviting him to come in for\nanother round.\nTo hell with that.\nWax turned and slammed his shoulder against a door into an empty\nsecond-class compartment and made for the window.\n“Hey!” the man said behind him. “Hey!”\nWax leaped at the window and increased his weight. He hit the window\nshoulder-first, arms covering his face, and smashed through—then barely\nmanaged to catch the bottom window frame as he fell outside.\nFingers dripping blood from the broken glass, he pulled himself up, stood\non the windowsill, and scaled the outside of the train, finally heaving himself\nonto the roof. Wind rushed around him, and he was shocked to see that he\nwasn’t alone up here. Ahead about four cars, a group of armed men pressed\ntoward the front of the train, bearing something large and seemingly heavy.\nWhat in the name of the lost metal was that?\n“Hey!” the large bandit said again as he climbed the side of the car.\nWax sighed, then kicked the man in the face as he tried to pull himself\nonto the top.

Why are you still\nfighting?\nThe brute’s head appeared a moment later, peeking over the lip of the\ncar’s roof, near the rear platform, which had a ladder. Wax rushed him,\npreparing to kick again, but the brute climbed up too quickly. He was\nholding something.\nOne of Wax’s gunbelts. Damn.\nThe man grinned, stepping onto the rooftop, pulling Ranette’s enormous\nshotgun out and dropping the gunbelt. Beneath them, the train shot out of the\nforest and rolled toward an open bridge rising hundreds of feet above the\nriver below.\nThe brute raised the shotgun as if to fire from the hip.\nExcellent.\nWax dove for the rooftop as the brute pulled the trigger, and the massive\nkick Ranette had built into the gun took him entirely by surprise. The\nweapon ripped out of his fingers, jerking backward and falling down\nbetween the cars. The man howled, cradling his hand.\nWax tackled him in the chest. The man grunted, stumbling backward, but\ncaught himself before he toppled off the train. Wax didn’t care.\nHe was after the gunbelt, which had fallen at the man’s feet. He snatched\nit with fingers still wet with blood. It held Ranette’s two cord devices, along\nwith a single, glorious metal vial.\nWax yanked it out, tucking the gunbelt into his waistband. However, the\nvial lurched in his fingers. He snatched it, holding on tightly, but the brute’s\nPush sent him backward across the train’s roof in a skid. He slipped and fell\nto his knees, catching the side of the train.\nThe Coinshot kept Pushing. Wax clung to the rooftop with his left hand,\nbut his right arm—which held the metal vial—strained in its socket. The\nbrute smiled and started walking forward. Each step closer let him Push\nharder.\nWax gritted his teeth. The cuts on his fingers were superficial, though they\nstung like hell and the blood made his grip slippery. He struggled, trying to\npull the vial toward his mouth, but failed.\nRanette’s sphere devices. They hung from the gunbelt tucked into his\nwaist. Could he use those? How? Beneath him, the train started across the\nbridge.\nThe thug advanced on Wax, rolling his shoulder and trying to make a fist\ndespite his broken thumb. Behind the man something moved on the ladder.\nA head coming up? Wayne!\nNo. He saw the tip of a gun wave as the person climbed. Wayne wouldn’t\nhave a gun. Marasi?\nSteris appeared at the lip of the roof, wind blowing her hair wildly. She\nlooked from the huge robber to Wax, then seemed to gasp—though the wind\nwas too loud for Wax to hear it. She scrambled up and set herself, crouching\non one knee, holding Ranette’s shotgun.\nOh no.\n“Steris!” he shouted.\nThe brute spun, noticing her as she set the gun at her shoulder, wide-eyed,\ndress rippling against her body in the wind.\nShe pulled the trigger. Unsurprisingly, the shot went wild, but it did\nmanage to clip the brute in the arm, spraying blood. The man grunted,"

He ripped the cork free with\nhis teeth and turned over in the air, sucking down the contents of the vial.\nCod-liver oil and metal flakes washed into his mouth. Swallowing took a\nprecious moment.\nNothing.\nNothing.\nNothing.\nPower.\nWax shouted, flaring steel and Pushing on the tracks up above. He shot\ndownward in a blur, slamming into Steris, grabbed her, and Pushed on the\nshotgun that toppled beneath her.\nIt hit the water.\nThey slowed immediately. Water viscosity being what it was, you could\nPush off something sinking. A second later, the shotgun hit the bottom of the\nchurning river, and that left the two of them hanging about two feet above\nthe water’s surface. A faint, solitary blue line led from Wax to the shotgun.\nSteris breathed in short, frantic gasps. She clung to him, blinked, then\nlooked down at the river.\n“What is wrong with that gun!” she said.\n“It’s meant for me to shoot,” Wax said, “when my weight is increased to\ncounteract the kick.” He looked up toward the disappearing train. It had\ncrossed the river, but now would have to slow and chug its way down some\nswitchbacks on a hill on the other side, coming out of the highlands to head\non toward New Seran.\n“Hold this,” he told Steris, handing her his gunbelt and removing the two\nspheres. “What were you thinking? I told you to stay back in the other car.”\n“As a point of fact,” she said, “you did not. You told me to stay safe.”\n“So?”\n“So, it has been my experience that the safest place in a gunfight is near\nyou, Lord Waxillium.”\nHe grunted. “Hold your breath.”\n“What? Why should I—”\nShe yelped as he Pushed on the steel bridge supports nearby, plunging\nthem down into the river. Ice-cold water surrounded them as Wax kept\nPushing, plunging downward until he reached his gun—easily located by its\nblue line—settled into the muck on the bottom. Ears throbbing from the\npressure, he snatched the gun, replacing it with one of Ranette’s sphere\ndevices, then Pushed.\nThey popped back out of the river, trailing water, and Wax Pushed them as\nhigh as his anchor would allow and handed Steris the shotgun to hold. From\nthere, he Pushed off one of the support beams below—launching them\nupward and to the side. A Push on one from the other direction sent them\nbounding upward the other way, and he was able to work them toward the\ntop of the bridge.\nThe angle of these Pushes had sent them out away from the tracks,"

When they soared up past the bridge, he needed to sling\nRanette’s other sphere device out—getting it into a small gap between bridge\nstruts. He engaged the hooks, so that the Push from below, combined with\nthe taut cord in his hand, swung him and Steris in an arc.\nHe landed on the tracks, a soggy Steris in one arm, cord in the other. He\ncould imagine Ranette’s grin as he told her how well the thing had worked.\nHe disengaged the hooks and yanked the device back into his hand, though\nhe had to wind the cord manually.\nSteris’s teeth chattered audibly, and he glanced at her as he finished\nwinding, expecting to see her frightened and miserable. Instead, despite\nbeing dripping wet, she had a stupid grin on her face, eyes alight with\nexcitement.\nWax couldn’t help smiling himself as he stowed Ranette’s sphere and tied\non his gunbelt, then shoved his shotgun into the holster. “Remember, you’re\nnot supposed to find things like that fun, Steris. You’re supposed to be\nboring. I have it on good authority from this woman I know.”\n“A tone-deaf man,” Steris said, “can still enjoy a good choir—even if he\ncould never participate.”\n“Not buying the act, my dear,” Wax said. “Not any longer. You just\nclimbed on top of a moving train car and shot a bandit, rescuing your\nfiancé.”\n“It behooves a woman,” she said, “to show an interest in her husband’s\nhobbies. Though I suppose I should be outraged, as this is the second\ndunking you’ve given me in a very short period of time, Lord Waxillium.”\n“I thought you said the first one wasn’t my fault.”\n“Yes, but this was twice as cold. So it evens out.”\nHe smiled. “You want to wait here, or join me?”\n“Um … join you?”\nHe nodded to the left. Far below, the train hit the end of its switchbacks\ndown the hillside, leveling out to approach the final bend before heading\nsouthward. Her eyes opened wider, then she grabbed him in a tight grip.\n“When we land,” he said, “keep your head down and find a place to hide.”\n“Got it.”\nHe took a deep breath, then launched them high in a powerful arc through\nthe night air. They sailed across the river, coming down like a bird of prey\ntoward the front of the train.\nWax slowed himself and Steris with a careful Push on the engine, setting\ndown atop the coal tender. Inside the cab right in front of them, a bandit held\na gun to the engineer’s head. Wax let go of Steris, then spun around and\npumped the shotgun—popping the expended shells into the air—and Pushed\non the shells, sending them through the back of the engine cab and right into\nthe bandit’s head.

Shot my fireman when\nhe tried to defend me, the bastards!”\n“Where’s the next town?”\n“Ironstand! We’re getting close. Few more minutes.”\n“Get us there as quickly as you can, and call for some surgeons and the\nlocal constables the moment we arrive.”\nThe man nodded frantically. Wax closed his eyes and took a deep breath to\norient himself.\nThe final push. Here we go.\n* * *\nHalfway through the train, Marasi had reason to curse Waxillium Ladrian.\nWell, another reason. She added it to the list.\nThough she was supposed to be finding Steris, she spent most of her time\nbeing mobbed by worried passengers who needed soothing. Apparently the\nbandits had quickly worked their way through the second- and third-class\ncars, shaking people down for what little money they had. The people were\nterrified, upset, and looking for anyone with a hint of authority to comfort\nthem.\nMarasi did her best, settling them onto benches, checking to see if any\nmore people were seriously wounded. She helped bandage a young man who\nhad stood up to a bandit, and now bore a shot in the side as a result. He\nmight make it.\nPassengers had seen Steris come through here. Marasi tried to contain her\nworry and peeked into the next car in the line. It was deserted save for one\npassenger standing calmly at the far end, cane in hand, blocking the passage.\nMarasi checked the various rooms as she entered, rifle held at the ready,\nbut spotted no bandits. This was the last car before the cargo cars—which,\noddly, were at the front of this train. This car’s interior showed its share of\nbullet holes in the woodwork, suggesting Waxillium had been here.\n“Sir?” Marasi asked, hastening to the lone man. He was slender, and\nyounger than she’d expected him to be from behind, considering how his\nposture slumped, and how he relied upon the cane to keep him upright. “Sir,\nit’s not safe for you here. You should move to the rear cars.”\nHe turned toward her with raised eyebrows. “I am always inclined to obey\nthe wishes of a pretty woman,” he said. She could see that he kept one hand\nstiff at his side, fingers closed as if clutching something. “But what of you,\nmiss? Is there no danger to you?”\n“I can care for myself,” Marasi said, noting that the next car in line was\ncrowded with corpses. She felt sick.\n“Indeed!” the man said. “You look quite capable. Quite capable indeed.”\nHe leaned in. “Are you more than you appear, perhaps? A Metalborn?”"

A Metalborn?”\nMarasi frowned at the odd question. She’d taken a dose of cadmium, of\ncourse—for all the good it would do. Her Allomancy was generally\nsomething to laugh at; she could slow down time in a bubble around herself,\nwhich meant speeding it up for everyone else.\nA wonderful power if you were bored and waiting for the play to start. But\nit wasn’t of so much use in combat, where you’d be left frozen in place\nwhile your enemies could escape, or just set themselves up to shoot you\nwhen the bubble dropped. True, she could make the bubble fairly large, so\nshe could catch others inside of it—but that would still leave her trapped,\nand likely with hostiles.\nThe man smiled at her, then abruptly raised his hand, the one that\nappeared to be clutching something. Marasi started to react, bringing her\nrifle up. But at that moment, the train unexpectedly lurched, slowing as if\nsomeone had leaned on the brake. The man cursed, stumbling and slamming\ninto the wall before falling to the floor. Marasi caught herself, but dropped\nthe rifle.\nShe looked at the man, who regarded her with wide eyes before\nmaladroitly stumbling to his feet—one of his legs didn’t work right—and\nhastening out of the train car onto the platform, slamming the door behind\nhim.\nMarasi stared after him, confused. She’d assumed he was pulling a gun on\nher, but that hadn’t been the case at all. The object had been far too small.\nShe reached for her gun, and beside it on the floor she was surprised to find a\nsmall metal cube with bizarre symbols on it.\nGunfire sounded ahead. Marasi tucked the curiosity away and shouldered\nher rifle, determined to find Waxillium and, hopefully, her stupid sister.\n* * *\nEyes closed, Wax felt the metal burning. That fire, comfortable and familiar.\nMetal was his soul. Compared to it, the chill of the river was no more than a\nraindrop on a bonfire.\nHe felt the gun in his fingers. A bandit’s gun, unfamiliar to him, yet he\nknew it—knew it by the lines pointing at its barrel, trigger, levers, the bullets\ninside. Five shots left. He could see them even with his eyes closed.\nGo.\nHe opened his eyes and leaped out of the engine, Pushing himself forward\nin a rush. He passed over the coal tender, then burst into the first cargo car—\nladen with mail in heaping sacks—and passed through in a tempest. He\nskidded out onto its rear platform and Pushed to either side, launching two\nbandit guards upward and outward, one in each direction.\nThe train ran up beside the river here. Trees blurred past on the left, water\non the right. Wax launched himself upward, onto the top of the second cargo\ncar, noting the bandits with their device here.

He stepped up to\nthe “device” the engineer had mentioned, which was nothing more than a\nlarge case of dynamite and a trigger linked to a clock. Wax ripped the\ndetonator off, tossed it aside, then Pushed the entire box away to be sure. It\nplunged into the river.\nSomething Pushed his gun out of his hand. He spun, finding the large\nbandit from before lumbering toward him across the roof. He’d left the\nlarger group of bandits on the next rooftop over.\nYou again, Wax thought with a growl, dropping his gunbelt, but resting his\nfoot on it to keep it from blowing away. The man came running toward Wax.\nWith the brute very close, Wax knelt and yanked out Ranette’s sphere\ndevice.\nThe bandit Pushed on that, of course—causing the sphere to leap\nbackward to the side. Wax kept a firm hold on the cord, wrapping it with a\nyank around the bandit’s leg.\nThe bandit stared down in confusion.\nWax Pushed, shoving the sphere into a batch of trees, engaging its hooks.\n“I believe this is your stop.”\nThe large man suddenly flew off the train, yanked by the cord—which was\nnow hooked to a tree. Wax picked up his gunbelt and advanced on the larger\ngroup of bandits, wind whipping around him on the rooftop.\nHe was facing down at least a dozen of them—and he had no weapon.\nFortunately, the group was busy throwing one of their members off the train.\nWax blinked in surprise. But that was indeed what they were doing—they\ntossed one of the bandits overboard. It was the man with the cane, who hit\nthe water beside the train with a splash. A group of the others started to\nfollow suit, leaping into the river. One spotted Wax, pointing. Six remaining\nbandits leveled weapons.\nThen froze.\nWax hesitated, the wind at his back. The men didn’t move. Didn’t flinch.\nDidn’t even blink. Wax hopped across to the next car, then took a cork from\nhis pocket—from one of his vials—and tossed it toward the men.\nIt hit some invisible barrier and froze there, hanging in the air. Wax\ngrinned, then dropped down between the cars and pushed into the one the\nmen were standing on. There he found Marasi standing atop a bunch of\nsuitcases, her shoulders pressed against the train’s ceiling just below the men\nso she could engage a speed bubble and freeze them all in place.\n9\nWax had never shot a doctor before, but he did like trying out new\nexperiences. Perhaps today would be the day.\n“I’m fine,” he growled as the woman dabbed with cotton at the wound on\nhis face, where the massive brute had punched him. His lip had split.\n“I’ll decide that,” she said.\nNearby, the Ironstand constables marched four befuddled bandits along\nthe train platform, which was flooded with light from a few tall arc lamps.\nWax sat on a bench near where the other surgeons were attending to the\nwounded. Farther back, in the shadows of the night, a tarp covered the\nbodies they’d retrieved. There were far too many of those."

There were far too many of those.\n“It looks worse than it is,” Wax said.\n“You had blood all over your face, my lord.”\n“I wiped my forehead with a bloody hand.” She had wrapped that hand\nwith gauze already, but had agreed that the cuts were superficial.\nFinally she stepped back and sighed, nodding. Wax stood up, grabbing his\ndamp suit coat and striding toward the train. He saw Marasi peering out of\nthe front. She shook her head.\nNo sign of Wayne or MeLaan.\nThe lump inside Wax’s stomach grew two sizes. Wayne’ll be fine, he told\nhimself. He can heal from practically anything. But there were ways to kill a\nBloodmaker. A shot to the back of the head. Prolonged suffocation.\nBasically, anything that would have forced Wayne to keep healing until his\nFeruchemical storages ran out.\nAnd, of course, there was the other thing. The strange effect that had\nsomehow stolen Wax’s Allomantic powers. If that worked on Feruchemy\ntoo …\nWax strode onto the train, stepping past Marasi without saying a word,\nand started his own search. The train was dark, now that it had stopped—and\nthe only lights came from the platform outside. There wasn’t much to see by.\n“Lord Waxillium?” Constable Matieu said, sticking his head in between\ntwo of the cars. The spindly man had a ready smile, which fell off his face as\nWax bustled past.\n“Busy,” Wax said, entering the next car.\nBlue lines let him see sources of metal even in the darkness. Wayne would\nbe carrying metal vials and his bracers. Look for faint sources of metal,\nhidden behind something. Perhaps … perhaps they’d just knocked him out\nand stuffed him somewhere.\n“Um…” the constable said from behind. “I was wondering if any of your\nother servants will be needing, um, emotional support.”\nWax frowned, looking out the window to where Drewton was sitting,\nsurrounded by no fewer than three nurses. He accepted a cup of tea from one\nwhile he complained about his ordeal. Wax could hear it even inside the train\ncar.\n“No,” Wax said. “Thank you.”\nMatieu followed him through the train. He was the local captain, though\nfrom what Wax gathered, this town was small enough that his “big cases”\nusually were on the order of who had been stealing Mrs. Hutchen’s milk off\nher doorstep. He was glad to have found surgeons. Most of them probably\nworked half their time on cows, but it was better than nothing.\nNot a few younger officers stood on the platform. They’d put away their\nstupid autograph books, fortunately, though they seemed deflated that their\ncaptain wouldn’t let them pester Wax.\nWhere? Wax thought, feeling more and more sick. Marasi arrived a\nmoment later with an oil lamp, her light illuminating the train car for him as\nhe poked through a cargo room full of mail bags.\nHe won’t be in here, Wax thought.

He searched this one, then\nwaved to Marasi and picked his way through the wreckage of the car that\nhad been robbed.\nMatieu tagged along. “I have to say, Lord Waxillium, that we’re very\nlucky you were aboard. The Nightstreet Gang has been growing bolder and\nbolder, but I never thought they’d try something like this!”\n“So this is an established gang?” Marasi said.\n“Oh, sure,” Matieu said. “Everyone in the area knows about the\nNightstreets, though mostly they hit cities closer to the Roughs. We figure\nit’s slim pickings out past the mountains, so they have begun to venture\ninward. But this! A full-on train robbery? And stealing Erikell payroll?\nThat’s daring. Those folks make weapons, you know.”\n“They had at least one Allomancer with them,” Wax said, leading the way\nthrough the empty courier car, which still smelled faintly of formaldehyde.\n“I hadn’t heard that,” Matieu said. “Even luckier you were along!”\n“I didn’t stop them from getting away, or from stealing the payroll.”\n“You killed or captured a good half of them, my lord. The ones we’ve got,\nthey’ll give us a lead on the others.” He hesitated. “We’ll have to put\ntogether a posse, my lord. They’ll be making for the Roughs. Sure could use\nyour help.”\nWax swept this room, focusing on the blue lines. “And the man with the\nlimp?”\n“My lord?”\n“He seemed to be in charge of them,” Wax said. “A man in a fine suit who\nwalked with a cane. About six feet tall, with a narrow face and dark hair.\nWho is he?”\n“I don’t know that one, my lord. Donny is the leader.”\n“Big guy?” Wax asked. “Neck like a stump?”\n“No, my lord. Donny is little and feisty. Evilest rusting kig you’ve ever\nseen.”\nKig. It was slang for a koloss-blooded person. Wax hadn’t seen anyone\namong the bandits with the proper skin color for that. “Thank you, Captain,”\nWax said.\nThe man seemed to recognize it as a dismissal, but he hesitated. “And can\nwe count on your help, my lord? When we chase down Donny and his\ngang?”\n“I’ll … let you know.”\nMatieu saluted, which was completely inappropriate—Wax wasn’t part of\nthis jurisdiction—and retreated. Wax continued searching, pulling open a\nluggage compartment beneath the first passenger car. The metal lines leading\ninto it only pointed at a few pieces of baggage.\n“Waxillium,” Marasi said, “you can’t help with their hunt. We have a job\nalready.”\n“Might be related.”\n“Might not be,” she said. “You heard him, Waxillium.

Instead of tossing dynamite at us and\nriddling the coach with bullets, they sent a couple men to rob what they\nassumed would be easy pickings.”\nWax chewed on that, then checked another luggage compartment, bracing\nhimself as he did so. No bodies. He let out a breath.\n“I can’t think about this right now,” he said.\nShe nodded in understanding. They checked the other compartments, and\nhe didn’t see any suspicious lines, so they moved on. Crossing the space\nbetween cars, he spotted Steris watching him. She sat alone on a bench with\na blanket around her shoulders, holding a cup of something that steamed.\nShe seemed perfectly calm.\nHe continued on. Losing friends was part of a lawman’s life; it had\nhappened to him more times than he wanted to count. But after what had\nhappened back in the city six months ago … well, he wasn’t sure what\nlosing Wayne would do to him. He steeled himself, moved to the next car,\nand opened the first of its luggage compartments, then froze.\nFaint steel lines coming from another place in this train car. They were\nmoving.\nWax rushed toward them. Marasi followed, suddenly alert, her lamp held\nhigh. The lines were coming from the floor inside one of the rooms. Only no\nluggage was on its racks, and no litter was on its floor. It was a private\ncompartment that hadn’t been rented out for the trip.\nWax entered and ripped open the luggage compartment in the floor.\nWayne blinked up at him. The younger man had mussed hair, and his shirt\nwas unbuttoned, but he wasn’t in any bonds that Wax could see. He didn’t\nseem to have been harmed at all. In fact …\nWax crouched down, Marasi’s light revealing what had been hidden to\nhim by the overhang of the luggage compartment. MeLaan, shirt completely\noff, was in the compartment too. She sat up, entirely unashamed of her\nnudity.\n“We’ve stopped!” she said. “Are we there already?”\n* * *\n“Well how was I supposed to know we’d get rusting attacked?” Wayne\nexclaimed, now properly clothed, though his hair was still a mess.\nWax sat listening with half an ear. The train officials had opened a room in\nthe station for them to use. He knew he should be angry, but he was mostly\njust relieved.\n“Because we are us,” Marasi said, arms folded. “Because we’re on our\nway to a dangerous situation. I don’t know. You could at least have told us\nwhat you were doing.” She hesitated. “And by the way, what do you think\nyou were doing?”\nWayne bowed his head where he sat before her. MeLaan leaned against\nthe wall near the door. She was looking toward the ceiling, as if trying to\nfeign innocence.\n“Movin’ on,” Wayne said, pointing at Marasi. “Like you told me to.”\n“That wasn’t moving on!

We’d wanted a place what was\nprivate-like, you know, and…” He shrugged.\n“Bah!” Marasi said. “Do you realize how worried Waxillium was?”\n“Don’t bring me into this,” Wax said, seated with his feet up on the next\nbench.\n“Oh, and you approve of this behavior?” Marasi asked, turning on him.\n“Heavens, no,” Wax said. “If I approved of half the things Wayne does,\nHarmony would probably strike me dead on the spot. But he’s alive, and\nwe’re alive, and we can’t blame him for getting distracted during what we\nassumed would be a simple ride.”\nMarasi eyed him, then sighed and walked back out onto the platform,\npassing MeLaan without a glance.\nWayne stood and wandered over to him, pulling his box of gum from his\npocket and tapping it against his palm to settle the powder inside. “These\nthieves, did one of them happen to shoot her when you weren’t lookin’?\n’Cuz she’s sure gotten stiff all of a sudden.”\n“She was just worried about you,” Wax said. “I’ll talk to her after she’s\ncooled down.”\nMeLaan left her position by the door. “Was there anything strange about\nthe attack?”\n“Plenty of things,” Wax said, standing and stretching. Rusts. Was he really\ngetting too old for all this, as Lessie always joked with him? He usually felt\nexhilarated after a fight.\nIt’s the deaths, he thought. Only one passenger had died, an older man.\nBut they’d lost half a dozen payroll guards, not to mention the many\nwounded.\n“One of the bandits,” he said to MeLaan, “he did something that\ndampened my Allomancy.”\n“A Leecher?” she asked.\nWax shook his head. “He didn’t touch me.”\nLeechers who burned chromium could blank another Allomancer’s metals\n—but it required touch. “It did feel the same. My steel was there one\nmoment, then gone the next. But MeLaan, there was some kind of device\ninvolved. A little metal cube.”\n“Wait,” a voice said. Marasi appeared in the doorway. “A cube?”\nAll three of them looked at her, and she blushed in the harsh electric light.\n“What?”\n“You stalked away,” Wayne pointed, “indigenously.”\n“And now I’m stalking back in,” Marasi said, striding toward Wax and\nfishing in her pocket. “I can be indigen—indignant in here just as easily.”\nShe pulled her hand out, holding a small metal cube."

Wax plucked it\nfrom her palm. “Where’d you get this?”\n“The guy with the cane dropped it,” Marasi said. “He moved as if to pull a\ngun on me, and raised this.”\nWax turned it toward MeLaan, and she shook her head.\n“That’s a real strange gun,” Wayne noted.\n“Is there anything in that lore VenDell talked about,” Wax said, “that\nmentions a device that negates Allomancy?”\n“Nothing I’ve heard,” MeLaan said.\n“I mean,” Wayne said, “it ain’t even got a barrel.”\n“But you said you don’t pay attention to the research, MeLaan,” Marasi\nsaid, taking the cube back.\n“That’s true.”\n“And if they could shoot the rusting thing,” Wayne added, “the bullet\nwould be small as a flea.”\nMarasi sighed. “Wayne, can’t you ever let a joke die?”\n“Hon, that joke started dead,” he said. “I’m just givin’ it a proper burial.”\n“We need another train south,” Marasi said, turning to the others.\n“These bandits might have information,” Wayne said. “Chasin’ them\ndown could be useful. ’Sides, I didn’t get to stomp none of them, on account\nof some untimely snogging.”\n“At least it was good snogging,” MeLaan added. Then, to Marasi’s glare,\nshe added, “What? It was. Poor guy hadn’t had a proper snog in years. Had a\nlot of pent-up energy.”\n“You’re not even human,” Marasi said. “You should be ashamed. Not to\nmention that you’re six hundred years old.”\n“I’m young at heart. Really—I copied this one off a sixteen-year-old that I\nate a few months back.”\nThe room grew very still.\n“Oh … was that gauche?” MeLaan said, wincing. “That was gauche,\nwasn’t it? She didn’t taste very good, if that’s anything to you. Hardly rotten\nat all. And … I should stop talking about this. New Seran? Are we going, or\nstaying to chase bandits?”\n“Going,” Wax said, which earned a nod from Marasi. “If this is connected,\nwe’ll run into them later. If it’s not, then I’ll see what I can do to help once\nwe’ve dealt with my uncle.”\n“And how’re we going to get to New Seran?” Wayne said. “Doesn’t look\nlike our train will be leaving anytime soon.”\n“Freight train,” Wax said, checking the wall lists. “Coming through in an\nhour. They’re going to move our train onto the repair track, so we can flag\nthat one down for a ride. It won’t be comfortable, but it will get us there by\nmorning. Go gather your luggage. Hopefully there aren’t too many holes in\nit.”\nWayne and MeLaan obeyed, walking out side by side. Maybe there was\nactually something there between them. If anything, Wayne didn’t seem the"

If anything, Wayne didn’t seem the\nleast bit put out by being reminded just how alien, and just how old, MeLaan\nwas.\nThen again, Wayne wasn’t known for his taste in women. Or, well, his\ntaste at all, really. Wax glanced at Marasi, who had remained behind. She\nheld up the little cube, turning it over in her fingers, inspecting the intricate\ncarvings it bore on its various faces.\n“Can I get VenDell’s notes back from you?” she said. “Maybe there’s\nsomething in them about this thing.”\n“More convinced this wasn’t a random train robbery?”\n“Maybe a little,” Marasi said. “You should talk to my sister.”\n“She seemed perfectly calm when I checked on her earlier.”\n“Of course she’s calm,” Marasi said. “She’s Steris. But she’s also doing\nneedlework.”\n“… And that’s bad?”\n“Steris only does needlework when she has an overwhelming desire to\nappear normal,” Marasi said. “She read somewhere that it’s an appropriate\nhobby for a woman of means. She hates it to death, but won’t tell a soul.\nTrust me. If needlework is involved, she’s upset. I could talk to her, but she’s\nnever listened to me. She didn’t even know about me until we were\nteenagers. Besides, you’ll need to get used to this.”\nShe strode from the room, and Wax—oddly—found himself smiling.\nWhatever else could be said, Marasi had come a long way since he’d first\nmet her.\nHe took his jacket off the hook on the wall and slipped it on, then walked\nback into the night. Marasi was calling for the stationmaster, probably to\narrange their passage on the cargo train. Wax strolled along the tracks,\npassing cold electric lights, until he reached the bench where Steris worked\non her needlepoint.\nHe settled down beside her. “Marasi says you’re having a tough time of\nit.”\nSteris paused her needlepoint. “You’re a very straightforward man, Lord\nWaxillium.”\n“Can be.”\n“But as we both know, it’s all an act. You were raised among Elendel’s\nelite. You had tutors and diction coaches. In your youth, you spent your time\nat parties and balls.”\n“And then I spent twenty years in the Roughs,” Wax said. “The winds out\nthere can weather the strongest granite. Are you surprised they can do the\nsame to a man?”\nShe turned to him, head cocked to the side.\nWax sighed and leaned back, stretching his legs out, ankles crossed.\n“Have you ever been somewhere you didn’t fit in? A place where everyone\nelse seems to get it immediately? They know what to do. They know what to\nsay. But rusts, you have to work to untangle it all?”\n“That describes my entire life,” Steris said softly.\nHe put his arm around her, and let her rest her head on his shoulder. “Well,\nthat was how those parties were for me.

Social situations were a chore.\nEveryone laughing, and me just standing there, stressed out of my mind and\ntrying to figure out the right thing to do. I didn’t smile a lot back then. Guess\nI still don’t. I’d escape the parties when I could, find my way to a quiet\nbalcony.”\n“And do what? Read?”\nWax chuckled. “No. I don’t mind a book now and then, but Wayne is the\nreal reader.”\nSteris raised her head, looking surprised.\n“I’m serious,” Wax said. “Granted, he likes ones with pictures now and\nthen, but he does read. Often out loud. You should hear him do the voices to\nhimself. Me … I’d just find a balcony that looked out over the city\nsomewhere, and I’d stare. Listen.” He smiled. “When I was a boy, more than\na few people thought I was slow because I’d sit there staring out a window.”\n“Then you found your way to the Roughs.”\n“I was so glad to be away from Elendel and its phoniness. You call me\nblunt. Well, that’s the man I want to be. That’s the man I admire. Perhaps\nI’m only acting like him, but it’s a sincere act. Hang me, but it is.”\nSteris sat quietly for a few moments, head on his shoulder, and Wax stared\nout into the night. A nice night, all things considered.\n“You’re wrong,” she noted, sounding drowsy. “You do smile. Most often\nwhen you’re flying on lines of steel. It’s the only time I think … I think I\nsee … pure joy in you.…”\nHe looked down at her, but she’d apparently dozed off, judging by the\nway she was breathing. He settled back, thinking about what she’d said, until\nthe cargo train finally pulled into the station.\n10\nWax started awake to the sound of distant explosions.\nHe immediately scrambled to his feet, reaching for his metals, bleary-eyed\nand disoriented. Where was he? Crew cabin of the cargo train. It was large,\nwith some stiff couches in the back for the engineers to catch a nap while\ntheir train was waiting to be unloaded. Steris was asleep on one, wrapped in\nhis jacket. Wayne dozed in the corner, hat over his face.\nThey’d left the servants behind for now; they would come along on the\nnext passenger train. MeLaan had chosen to ride in the back with their\nluggage—she had wanted to look through her bundles of bones to pick the\nright body for the night.\nWax downed metals and whipped out Vindication, stumbling forward\ntoward the sounds—which, now fully awake, he wasn’t certain were\nexplosions at all. A continuous rumble, like an earthquake, off in the\ndistance. He stepped out into the cab proper of the engine car. This was a\nnewer machine, one of the oil-driven ones, with no need for a coal tender.\nMarasi stood near the front with the engineer, a tall fellow with bright\neyes and forearms like pistons.\nThat rumbling … Wax frowned, lowering his gun as Marasi glanced at\nhim.

        "text": "him. The sky was bright blue; morning had arrived. He stepped into the\ncabin, and could see that ahead, New Seran rose before them. The city\nspread across a series of enormous, flat-topped stone terraces. There were at\nleast a dozen of them, and each was split by multiple streams, which crossed\nthem and then dropped off the edge down to the next terrace. The sound\nwasn’t an earthquake or explosion, but that of waterfalls.\nIn places, the drop was just a little ripple—a fall of some five feet or so.\nBut in others, majestic waterfalls plunged fifty feet or more before pounding\nonto the next stone platform. It looked like a man-made effect, for the\nvarious split streams and waterfalls eventually ran back together into the\nriver, which flowed away from the city toward distant Elendel.\nWax slid Vindication into her holster, though it took two tries because he\nwas so mesmerized by the waterfalls. Indeed, the whole city. Buildings\nsprouted between the rivers, and vibrant green vines draped the cliffs like\nnature’s own tresses. Beyond, the Seran mountains rose, lofty and whited at\nthe tops.\nMarasi grinned, leaning out of the cab to get a better look up at the heights\nof the city. The engineer stood by his levers, valves, and cranks trying to act\ncasual, though he was obviously watching Wax and Marasi for their\nreactions.\n“I often think,” the man eventually said, “that Harmony was showing off a\nlittle when He made this place.”\n“I had no idea this was here,” Wax said, stepping up beside Marasi.\nBehind him, Wayne yawned and stumbled to his feet.\n“Yeah, well,” the engineer said, “people from Elendel often forget there’s\na whole country out here. No offense, my lord. There’s a lot of Elendel to\ntake in, so it makes sense you’d get a little blinded by it.”\n“You’re from New Seran?” Marasi asked.\n“Born and raised, Captain Colms.”\n“Then you can tell us where to find our hotel, perhaps?” Marasi asked.\n“The Copper Gate?”\n“Oh, that’s a nice one,” the engineer said, pointing. “Top terrace, in the\nwaterman district. Look for the big statue of the Lord Mistborn. It’s not two\nblocks from there.”\n“How close can you get us?” Marasi asked.\n“Not close at all, I’m afraid,” the engineer said. “We’re not a passenger\ntrain, and even those can only go to the middle tiers. We’ll be down at the\nbottom. It’ll take you a few hours to ride the gondolas up. There are ramps\ntoo, if you’d prefer a carriage, but they take longer—and the gondolas have a\nbetter view.”\nGondolas would have been wonderful, Wax thought, if most of them had\nhad more than a few hours of sleep. With the reception tonight, they’d need\nto be rested and ready to go.\n“Shortcut?” he asked Marasi.\n“You realize I’m wearing a skirt.”\n“I do. What happened to that fancy new constable uniform with the\ntrousers?”\n“Packed away. Not everyone likes wearing uniforms when we don’t have\nto, Waxillium.”\n“Well, you can wait and take the gondolas,” Wax said. “Think of me"

Not everyone likes wearing uniforms when we don’t have\nto, Waxillium.”\n“Well, you can wait and take the gondolas,” Wax said. “Think of me\nresting peacefully in a soft hotel bed while you blink bleary eyes and droop\nagainst—”\n“All right, fine,” Marasi said, stepping up to him. “Just stay away from\ncrowds.”\nWax grabbed her around the waist. “I’ll be back for the rest of you,” he\ntold Wayne, who nodded. “Engineer, have our things sent to the Copper\nGate, if you please.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\nWax slid open the side of the cab, took another drink of metal flakes—\nrecovered from the stash in his luggage—then pulled Marasi tight, burned\nsteel, and leaped. A flared Push sent them soaring away from the train, which\nwas slowing as it approached the buildings clustered around the base of New\nSeran.\nThey dropped toward these, but a shot from Vindication as they neared the\nground gave him something to bounce off of. He sent them upward, past the\nlower tiers, using metal he found there to keep them aloft.\nThe homes here were much smaller than those in Elendel. Quaint, even. In\nElendel, you could rarely afford to waste space on a single dwelling—even\nin the slums, towering apartments were the norm. There was a kind of\neternal shift going on, where sections of town would fall into disrepair over\ntime, filling with the poor while those able to afford something new moved\nto other sections. It was fascinating to him that, if you looked at old maps,\nwhat were now slums had once been considered prime real estate.\nHe saw few apartment buildings and only three skyscrapers, confined to a\nsmall commercial district on the top terrace. Though the terraces constrained\nthe city’s boundaries, they looked large enough to hold the population. Lots\nof parks and small streams, none deep enough to be navigable like Elendel’s\ncanals.\nHe stayed to the rooftops, rather than the streets, for Marasi’s sake—\nthough she didn’t have much trouble with her skirt. She’d tucked it around\nher legs before they started, and the generally upward motion kept it from\nflaring.\nWax threw the two of them in great leaping arcs over residential areas\nuntil they reached the next cliff face, where he found a gondola and used it\nas an anchor to shoot them up the fifty feet or so toward the top tier of the\nterraces. He exulted in the moment, the freedom, the beauty of it. There was\na majesty about soaring alongside a churning waterfall, with sparkling pools\nand lush gardens spreading out beneath.\nThey topped the cliff face, and Wax landed them softly alongside the falls.\nMarasi let out a held breath as he set her down; he could tell from the tension\nof her grip that she hadn’t enjoyed the flight as much as he had. Steelpushing\nwasn’t natural to her, nor were the heights—she backed away from the cliff\nas soon as she was free.\n“Going to go get the others?” she asked.\n“Let’s find the hotel first,” Wax said, pointing the way toward a statue\nhe’d spotted upon landing.

He could still make out the green patina of the\nstatue’s head over the tops of the nearby homes. He started in that direction.\nMarasi joined him, and they entered a street with a fair amount of foot\ntraffic, papergirls and boys hawking broadsheets at every corner. Fewer\nhorses or carriages than in Elendel—almost none, though he did see a fair\nnumber of pedicabs. That made sense, with the layout of the city. He found it\ninteresting that the gondola system wasn’t only for getting between terraces;\nthere were also lines crossing the sky above them carting people from one\nsection of this terrace to another.\n“Like a shark among minnows,” Marasi mumbled.\n“What’s that?” Wax asked.\n“Look at how people swerve around you,” Marasi said. “Lord Cimines\nonce did a study comparing constables to sharks, showing how the people in\na crowded walkway responded exactly the same way as animals do to a\npredator moving nearby.”\nHe hadn’t noticed, but she was right. People gave him a wide berth—\nthough not because they guessed he was a constable. It was the mistcoat\nduster, the weapons, and perhaps his height. Everyone seemed a little shorter\ndown here, and he saw over the crowd by several inches.\nIn Elendel, his clothing had been abnormal—but so was everyone’s. That\ncity was a mishmash, like an old barrel full of spent cartridges. All different\ncalibers represented.\nHere, the people wore lighter clothing than in Elendel. Pastel dresses for\nthe ladies, striped white suits and boater hats for the men. Compared to\nthem, he was a bullet hole in a stained-glass window.\n“Never been good at blending in anyway,” he said.\n“Fair enough,” Marasi said. “I’ve been meaning to ask. Do you need\nWayne tonight?”\n“At the party?” Wax asked, amused. “I have trouble imagining a situation\nwhere he doesn’t end up drunk in the punch bowl.”\n“Then I’ll borrow him,” Marasi said. “I want to check the graveyards for\nReLuur’s spike.”\nWax grunted. “That will be dirty work.”\n“Which is why I asked for Wayne.”\n“Noted. What do you think the chances are you’ll find the thing buried in\na grave?”\nMarasi shrugged. “I figure we’ll start with the most obvious and easiest\nmethod.”\n“Grave robbing is the easiest method?”\n“It is with proper preparation,” Marasi said. “I don’t intend to do the\ndigging, after all.…”\nWax stopped listening.\nThe chatter of the crowd faded as he froze in place, staring at a broadsheet\nheld up by a papergirl on a nearby corner. That symbol, the jagged reverse\nmah … he knew that symbol all too well. He left Marasi midsentence,\npushing through the crowd to the girl and snatching the paper.\nThat symbol.

Where is it?”\n“Just up Blossom Way,” the girl said, pointing with her chin and making\nthe coins in his palm disappear.\n“Come on,” he said, interrupting Marasi as she started saying something.\nPeople did make way for him, which was convenient. He could have taken\nto the sky, but he found the mansion without difficulty, partially because of\nthe people crowded outside and pointing. The symbol was painted in red,\nexactly like the one he’d known back in the Roughs, but this time it marred\nthe wall of a fine, three-story stone mansion instead of a stagecoach.\n“Waxillium, for the love of sanity,” Marasi said, catching up to him.\n“What has gotten into you?”\nHe pointed at the symbol.\n“I recognize that,” Marasi said. “Why would I recognize that?”\n“You read the accounts of my time in the Roughs,” Wax said. “It’s in there\n—that’s the symbol of Ape Manton, one of my old nemeses.”\n“Ape Manton!” Marasi said. “Didn’t he—”\n“Yes,” Wax said, remembering the nights of torture. “He hunts\nAllomancers.”\nBut why would he be here? Wax had put him away, and not just in some\nminor village. He’d been locked up in True Madil, biggest town in the\nNorthern Roughs, with a jail like a vise. How in Harmony’s True Name had\nhe gotten all the way down to New Seran?\nRobbery wouldn’t be the end of Manton’s activities here. He always had a\nmotive behind the thefts, a goal. I have to figure out what he took, and why\nhe—\nNo.\nNo, not right now. “Let’s get to the hotel,” Wax said, ripping himself away\nfrom the sight of that red symbol.\n“Rusts,” Marasi said, hurrying after him. “Could he be involved\nsomehow?”\n“With the Set? Not a chance. He hates Allomancers.”\n“Enemy of my enemy…”\n“Not the Ape,” Wax said. “He wouldn’t take the hand of a Metalborn\ntrying to save him from slipping to his death.”\n“So…”\n“So he’s not part of this,” Wax said. “We ignore him. I’m here for my\nuncle.”\nMarasi nodded, but seemed disturbed. They passed a Lurcher juggler,\ndropping balls and tugging them back up into the air—along with the\noccasional object from among the amused crowd of watchers. A waste of\nAllomantic abilities. And all these people. Suffocating. He had hoped that in\nleaving Elendel, he would escape crowded streets. He nearly pulled out his\ngun and fired a shot to clear them all away.\n“Wax…” Marasi said, taking his arm.\n“What.”\n“What? Rusts, your stare could nail a person’s head to the wall right\nnow!”\n“I’m fine,” he said, pulling his arm away from her.\n“This vendetta against your uncle is—”\n“It’s not a vendetta.” Wax picked up his pace, striding through the crowd,"

I don’t\nneed to know his exact plan to know how bad that is. What if he’s making an\narmy of Thugs and Coinshots? Twinborn. Compounders.”\n“That might be true,” Marasi admitted. “But you aren’t chasing him\nbecause of any of that, are you? He beat you. In the Hundredlives case,\nMister Suit got the best of you. Now you’re going to win the war where you\nlost the battle.”\nHe stopped in place, turning on her. “How petty do you think I am?”\n“Considering what I just told you,” she said, “I’d say I consider you\nprecisely that petty. It’s not wrong to be angry at Suit, Waxillium. He’s\nholding your sister. But rusts, please don’t let it cloud your judgment.”\nHe took a deep breath, then gestured toward the mansion up the street.\n“You want me to go chasing after the Ape instead?”\n“No,” Marasi said, then blushed. “I agree that we need to stay focused on\ngetting back the spike.”\n“You’re here for the spike, Marasi,” Wax said. “I’m here to find Suit.” He\nnodded down the street, toward a discreet hotel sign, barely visible on the\nfront of a building. “You go check us in. I’m going to fetch the others.”\n* * *\n“With this suite and the others, you’ll basically have the entire top floor to\nyourselves.” The hotel owner—who insisted upon being called Aunt Gin—\nbeamed as she said it.\nWayne yawned, rubbing his eyes as he poked through the lavish room’s\nbar. “Great. Lovely. Can I have your hat?”\n“My … hat?” The elderly woman looked up at the oversized hat. The\nsides drooped magnificently, and the thing was festooned with flowers. Like,\noodles of them. Silk, he figured, but they were really good replicas.\n“You have a lady friend?” Aunt Gin asked. “You wish to give her the\nhat?”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “I need to wear it next time I’m an old lady.”\n“The next time you what?” Aunt Gin grew pale, but that was probably on\naccount of the fact that Wax went stomping by, wearing his full rusting\nmistcoat. That man never could figure out how to blend in.\n“Do these windows open?” Wax asked, pointing toward the penthouse\nsuite’s enormous bay windows. He stepped up onto one of the sofas and\nshoved on the window.\n“Well, they used to open,” Aunt Gin said. “But they rattled in the breezes,\nso we painted them shut and sealed the latches. Never could stand the\nthought of someone—”\nWax shoved one of them open, breaking off the latch and making a sharp\ncracking sound as the paint outside was ripped, perhaps some of the wood\nsplintering."

Good shoulders, too.”\n“Well, I—”\n“Please ignore him,” Steris said, rising and walking over. “Here, I’ve\nprepared for you a list of possible scenarios that might transpire during our\nresidence here.”\n“Steris…” Wax said, forcing open the third and final window.\n“What?” she demanded. “I will not have the staff unprepared. Their safety\nis our concern.”\n“Fire?” Aunt Gin asked, reading the list. “Shoot-outs. Robbery. Hostage\nsituations. Explosions?”\n“That one is completely unfair,” Wax said. “You’ve been listening to\nWayne.”\n“Things do explode around you, mate,” Wayne said, munching peanuts.\nNice bit of salt on these.\n“He’s right, unfortunately,” Steris said. “I’ve accounted for seventeen\nexplosions involving you. That’s a huge statistical anomaly, even\nconsidering your profession.”\n“You’re kidding. Seventeen?”\n“Afraid so.”\n“Huh.” He had the decency to look proud of it, at least.\n“A pastry shop once blew up while we was in it,” Wayne said, leaning in\nto Aunt Gin. “Dynamite in a cake. Big mess.” He held out some peanuts\ntoward her. “How about I throw in these peanuts with the shoe?”\n“Those are my peanuts! From this very room!”\n“But they’re worth more now,” Wayne said. “On account of my being real\nhungry.”\n“I told you to ignore him,” Steris said, tapping on the notebook she’d\nhanded Aunt Gin. “Look, you only read the table of contents. The rest of the\npages contain explanations of the possible scenarios I’ve outlined, and\nsuggested responses to them. I’ve sorted the list by potential for property\ndamage.”\nWax leaped into the center of the room, then thrust his hand forward. The\ndoor quivered."

The\ndoor quivered.\n“What … what is he doing?” Aunt Gin asked.\n“Checking to see where the best places in the room are for slamming the\ndoor with his mind,” Wayne said. “In case someone bursts in on us.”\n“Just read the notebook, all right?” Steris requested in a pleasant tone.\nAunt Gin looked toward her, seeming bewildered. “Are these things …\nthreats?”\n“No, of course not!” Steris said. “I only want you to be prepared.”\n“She’s thorough,” Wayne said.\n“I like to be thorough.”\n“Usually that means if you ask her to kill a fly, she’ll burn down the house\njust to be extra sure it gets done.”\n“Wayne,” Steris said, “you’re needlessly making the lady concerned.”\n“Flooding from a diverted waterfall,” Aunt Gin said, reading from the\nbook again. “Koloss attack. Cattle stampede through the lobby?”\n“That one is highly unlikely,” Steris said, “but it never hurts to be\nprepared!”\n“But—”\nThe door to the adjoining suite slammed open. “Hello, humans,” MeLaan\nsaid, stepping into the doorway wearing nothing more than a tight pair of\nshorts and a cloth wrapped around her chest. “I need to put on something\nappropriate for tonight. What do you think? Large breasts? Small breasts?\nExtra-large breasts?”\nEverybody in the room paused, then turned toward her.\n“What?” MeLaan said. “Picking a proper bust size is vital to a lady’s\nevening preparations!”\nSilence.\n“That’s … kind of an improper question, MeLaan,” Steris finally said.\n“You’re just jealous because you can’t take yours off to go for a run,”\nMeLaan said. “Hey, where is that bellboy with my things? I swear, if he\ndrops my bags and cracks any of my skulls, there will be fury in this room!”\nShe stalked away.\n“Did she say skulls?” Aunt Gin said.\nThe door slammed.\n“Aha!” Wax said, lowering his hand. “There it is.”\nMarasi approached and wrapped her arm around the elderly lady’s\nshoulders, leading her away. “Don’t worry. It won’t be nearly as bad as they\nmake it seem. Likely nothing will happen to you or your hotel.”\n“Other than Wax rippin’ your windows apart,” Wayne noted.\n“Other than that,” Marasi said, giving him a glare.\n“Young lady,” Aunt Gin said under her breath, “you need to get away\nfrom these people.”\n“They’re fine,” Marasi said, reaching the door. “We’ve just had a long\nnight.”\nAunt Gin nodded hesitantly.\n“Good,” Marasi said. “Now, when you get down below, would you please\nsend someone to the trade bureau for me? Have them collect the names of\neach and every person who works at the local graveyards.”\n“Graveyards?”\n“It’s vitally important,” Marasi said, then pushed the woman out and shut\nthe door.\n“Graveyards?” MeLaan said, sticking her head into the room.

She was\nnow completely bald. “Reminds me. Would you order me something to eat?\nA nice hunk of aged meat.”\n“Rotting, you mean,” Wax said.\n“Nothing like the odor of a nice flank after a day in the sun,” MeLaan\nsaid, ducking back into her room as a knock came at the other door. “Ah!\nMy bags. Excellent. What? No, of course there aren’t corpses in these. Why\nwould I need bones with the flesh still on them? Thank you. Bye.”\nWayne popped the last of the peanuts into his mouth. “I dunno about you\nall, but I’m gonna find a place to snore for a few hours.”\n“Sleeping arrangements, Waxillium?” Marasi asked.\n“You and Steris in the suite across the hall,” Wax said, “Wayne and I in\nhere. MeLaan gets her own room. She probably wants to, um…”\n“Melt?” Marasi offered.\n“… on her own.”\n“I’m good, really,” MeLaan called from the next room. A second later she\nopened the door again. She wore the same bones and build, but this time she\nwas completely bare-chested.\nIt wasn’t a woman’s chest.\n“I solved the problem,” MeLaan said. “I’ll go as a fellow. That will\nprobably be more covert anyway. Just have to choose the right bones.”\nWayne cocked his head. She’d sculpted her face too, giving herself\nmasculine features. Steris’s eyes were bulging. At least that was worth\nseeing.\n“You’re…” Steris said. “You’ll become a…”\n“A man?” MeLaan asked. “Yeah. It’ll look better when I’ve decided on\nthe right body. Need to settle on a voice, too.” She looked around the room.\n“Um, is this a problem?”\nEveryone looked at Wayne for some reason. He thought for a moment,\nthen shrugged. Maybe he should have given his shoes to her.\n“You don’t mind?” Steris demanded of him.\n“It’s still her.”\n“But she looks like a man!”\n“So does the lady what runs this house,” Wayne said, “but she has kids, so\nsomeone still decided to take her an—”\n“It will do, MeLaan,” Wax said, resting a hand on Steris’s arm.\n“Assuming you can get into the party.”\n“Don’t worry about that,” she said, spinning around. “I will get in, and be\nready to give you support. But this is your play, Ladrian, not mine. You’re\nthe detective; I’m just around for the punchy-punchy, stabby-stabby.”\nShe closed the door. Wayne shook his head. Now that, that’s a situation a\nman don’t rightly encounter all that often.… Well, he’d found occasion to be\nan old lady now and then, so it made sense to him. It was probably good for\na woman to be a fellow once in a while, if only to offer some perspective.\nEasier to piss too.

Couldn’t discount that.\n“She assumes,” Wax said, “that our detective style isn’t normally the\npunchy-punchy, stabby-stabby type.”\n“To be fair,” Wayne said, “it’s usually a more shooty-shooty, whacky-\nwhacky type.”\nMarasi rubbed her forehead. “Why are we having this conversation?”\n“Because we’re tired,” Wax said. “Get some sleep, everyone. Wayne,\nyou’re going to go with Marasi tonight and dig up some graves.” He took a\ndeep breath. “And I, unfortunately, am going to a party.”\n11\nWearing a formal cravat and jacket reminded Wax of the year after he’d left\nthe Village. A year when his uncle had gleefully wrapped him in the\npackaging of a young nobleman and presented him to the city’s elite, feeling\nhe’d won some kind of war when Wax was expelled from Terris society.\nWax had moved back in with his parents, of course. But it had been his\nuncle who had overseen his education, grooming him specifically as heir to\nthe house. After that time in the Village, Wax’s life had grown to be less and\nless about his immediate family—he’d barely seen his parents during that\nyear, despite living with them.\nThat was when his uncle’s grip had really started to strangle him. Wax\ntapped his fingers on the armrest of his carriage, remembering those parties.\nHow much were his memories of them colored by his uncle’s presence?\nThe carriage eventually pulled up before a resplendent mansion with\nstained-glass windows and limelights burning outside. A classical style of\nlighting, though the interior had little in common with the ancient keeps of\nlore it was meant to evoke—as he well knew from the floor plans he’d\nmemorized earlier today, while the others were sleeping.\nThis mansion was more sprawling than imposing, with a multipeaked roof\ndesign, like the profile of a mountain range. A line of carriages waited to pull\nthrough the coach portico and drop off their occupants.\n“You’re nervous,” Steris said, laying her hand on his arm. She wore white\nlace gloves, and her dress—which she’d fretted over for at least an hour—\nwas one of the filmy and gauzy ones that the most fashionable ladies in\nElendel were wearing this year. The skirt was more full and cloudlike than\nthe more traditional gowns Steris usually favored.\nHe’d been surprised when she’d chosen it. Most of her wardrobe,\nespecially on this trip, was chosen for utility. Why wear this now?\n“I’m not nervous,” Wax said, “I’m contemplative.”\n“Shall we go over the plan?”\n“What plan?” Wax said.\nReLuur, in his ravings, had directed them toward this party of Kelesina\nShores, who was a lady of some prestige in New Seran—and who he implied\nwas connected to all this. She was their best lead, though ReLuur’s notebook\nhad also listed five other families he thought were of interest.\nThe problem was, none of those notes mentioned why they were of\ninterest—or what it was ReLuur thought they knew.

Why would a group of\nlords and ladies of the outer cities elite have anything to do with an ancient\narchaeological relic? True, some noblemen liked to consider themselves\n“gentlemen adventurers.” But those types mostly sat around smoking cigars\nand talking. At least that fop Jak actually left his rusting house.\nTime wore on, as carriages moved up the drive with all the speed of a line\nof cows on a hot day. Finally, Wax kicked open his door. “Let’s walk.”\n“Oh dear,” Steris said with a sigh. “Again?”\n“Don’t tell me you didn’t plan for this.”\n“I did. But this line isn’t that long, Lord Waxillium. Don’t you think this\ntime maybe we should wait?”\n“I can see the rusting front doors,” Wax said, pointing. “We can walk to\nthem in thirty seconds. Or we can sit here and wait as pompous people\nwaddle out of their seats and fuss with their scarves.”\n“I see the night is starting off on the right foot,” Steris said. Wax hopped\ndown, ignoring the footman’s offered hand. He waved the man back, and\nhelped Steris from the vehicle himself. “Go ahead and park,” he called to the\ncoachman. “We’ll call for you when we’re done.” He hesitated. “If you hear\ngunshots, go back to the hotel. We’ll make our own way.”\nThe coachman started, but nodded. Wax held his arm out for Steris, and\nthe two strolled along the path into the mansion grounds, passing carriages\nfull of people who seemed to be trying to glare at them without actually\nlooking in their direction.\n“I’ve prepared a list for you,” Steris said.\n“I’m so surprised.”\n“Now, no complaining, Waxillium. It will help. I’ve put the list in this\nlittle book,” Steris said, producing a palm-sized notebook, “for ease of\nreference. Each page contains a conversation opener, indexed to the people it\nwill likely work best upon. The numbers below list ways you could segue\nthe conversation into useful areas and perhaps figure out what our targets are\nup to, and what their connection is to the Bands of Mourning.”\n“I’m not socially incompetent, Steris,” Wax said. “I can make small talk.”\n“I know that,” Steris said, “but I’d rather avoid an incident like the Cett\nparty.…”\n“Which Cett party?”\n“The one where you head-butted someone.”\nHe cocked his head. “Oh, right. That smarmy little man with the\nridiculous mustache.”\n“Lord Westweather Cett,” Steris said. “Heir to the house fortune.”\n“Right, right…” Wax said. “Stupid Cetts. In my defense, he did call me\nout. Demanding to duel a Coinshot. I probably saved his life.”\n“By breaking his nose.” She held up her hand. “I am not requesting\njustifications or explanations, Lord Waxillium. I merely thought I’d do what\nI could to help.”\nHe grumbled, but took the book, flipping through it by lamplight as they\nwalked across the grounds. At the back of the book were descriptions of the"

At the back of the book were descriptions of the\nvarious people likely to be at the party. He’d memorized some descriptions\nVenDell had sent, but this list was far more extensive.\nAs usual, Steris had done her research. He smiled, tucking the book into\nhis jacket pocket. Where had she found the time? They continued up the\npath, though Wax froze as he heard rustling in the shrubbery nearby. He\nburned steel instantly, noticing some moving points of metal, and his hand\nwent to the pistol under his jacket.\nA dirty face peered out and grinned. The eyes were milky white. “Clips\nfor the poor, good sir,” the beggar said, stretching out a hand and exposing\nlong, unkempt fingernails and a ragged shirt.\nWax kept his hand on his weapon, studying the man.\nSteris cocked her head. “Are you wearing cologne, beggar?”\nWax nodded as he too smelled it, faintly.\nThe beggar started, as if surprised, then grinned. “It’s got a good kick to it,\nmy lady.”\n“You’ve been drinking cologne?” Steris asked. “Well, that can’t be\nhealthy.”\n“You should be away from here, beggar,” Wax said, eyeing the cluster of\nattendants and coachmen closer to the building’s entrance. “These are\nprivate grounds.”\n“Oh, my lord, I know it, I do.” The beggar laughed. “I own the place,\ntechnically. Now, regarding those coins for old Hoid, my good lord…” He\npushed his hand forward farther, eyes staring sightlessly.\nWax dug in his pocket. “Here.” He tossed the man a banknote. “Get off\nthe grounds and find yourself a proper drink.”\n“A generous lord indeed!” the beggar said, dropping to his knees and\nfishing for the banknote. “But too much! Far too much!”\nWax took Steris’s arm again, walking her toward the imposing front\ndoors.\n“My lord!” the beggar screeched. “Your change!”\nHe saw the blue line moving and reacted immediately, spinning and\ncatching the coin, which had been hurled with exacting accuracy at his head.\nSo, not blind after all. Wax snorted, pocketing the coin as a passing\ngroundsman saw the beggar and shouted, “Not you again!”\nThe beggar cackled and disappeared back into the shrubs.\n“What was that about?” Steris asked.\n“Damned if I know,” Wax said. “Shall we?”\nThey proceeded down the row of waiting carriages, and though the line\nhad sped up during their stroll, they still reached the front doors before they\notherwise would have. Wax tipped his head toward a large woman who\nbarely fit through the door of her carriage, then strode up the steps with\nSteris on his arm.\nHe presented his card at the door, though they would know to watch for\nhim. This was no simple reception; this was about politics. There would\nprobably be only one official speech—that of the host to the attendees—but\neveryone knew why they were here. To mingle, share ideas, and likely be\ninvited to donate to one of many causes reflecting outer cities interests."

To mingle, share ideas, and likely be\ninvited to donate to one of many causes reflecting outer cities interests.\nWax passed the doorkeeper, who cleared his throat and pointed toward an\nalcove in the side of the entryway. There, servants were taking hats, coats,\nand shawls.\n“We’ve nothing to check,” Wax said, “thank you.”\nThe man took Wax’s arm gently as he tried to proceed. “The lady of the\nhouse has asked that all attendees be unburdened of items of a vulgar nature,\nmy lord. For the safety of all parties attending.”\nWax blinked, then finally got it. “We have to check weapons? You’re\nkidding.”\nThe tall man said nothing.\n“I don’t think he’s the joking type,” Steris noted.\n“You realize,” Wax said, “that I’m a Coinshot. I could kill a dozen people\nwith your cufflinks.”\n“We’d appreciate it if you didn’t,” the doorkeeper said. “If you please,\nLord Ladrian, there are to be no exceptions. Do we need to call the house\nLurcher to make certain you are being honest with us?”\n“No,” Wax said, pulling his arm free. “But if something goes wrong\ntonight, you’re going to wish we’d never had this conversation.” He walked\nwith Steris to the counter where white-gloved servants were taking hats in\nexchange for tickets. He reluctantly took Vindication from the holster under\nhis arm and set her on the counter.\n“Is that all, my lord?” the woman there asked.\nHe hesitated, then sighed and knelt, pulling his backup gun—a tiny two-\nshotter—from the holster on his calf. He dropped it onto the counter.\n“Might we have a look in the lady’s purse?” the servant asked.\nSteris submitted.\n“You realize,” Wax said, “that I’m a deputized constable. If anyone should\nbe armed, it’s me.”\nThe servants said nothing, though they seemed embarrassed as they\nhanded back Steris’s purse and gave Wax a ticket for his weapons.\n“Let’s go,” he said, pocketing the pasteboard and trying—unsuccessfully\n—to hide his annoyance. Together they approached the ballroom.\n* * *\nWayne liked how banks worked. They had style. Many people, they’d keep\ntheir money out of sight, hidden under beds and some such. What was the\nfun of that? But a bank … a bank was a target. Building a place like this,\nthen stuffing it full of cash, was like climbing atop a hill and daring anyone\nwho approached to try to knock you off.\nHe figured that must be the point. The sport of it. Why else would they put\nso much valuable stuff together in one place? It was supposed to be a\nmessage, proof to the little people that some folks were so rich, they could\nuse their money to build a house for their money and still have enough\nmoney left to fill that house.\nRobbing such a place was suicide. So all that potential thieves could do\nwas stand outside and salivate, thinking of the stuff inside. Really, a bank\nwas like a giant sign erected to say “rust off” to everyone who passed by.\nWhich was magnificent."

Marasi wanted to come here before the\ngraveyards. Something about the bank records leading them to the right\nlocation.\n“All right, see,” Wayne said, “I’ve got it figured out. I’m gonna be a rich\nfellow. Made loads off of the sweat and blood o’ lesser men. Only I won’t\nsay it like that, ’cuz I’ll be in character, you see.”\n“Is that so?” Marasi said, starting up the steps.\n“Yup,” Wayne said, joining her. “Even brought me fancy hat.” He held up\na top hat and spun it on his finger.\n“That hat belongs to Waxillium.”\n“No it don’t,” Wayne said, putting it on. “I gave ’im a rat for it.”\n“A … rat?”\n“Minus the tail,” Wayne said. “On account of this hat bein’ kinda dusty\nwhen I took it. Anyway, I’ll be the rich fellow. You be my younger brother’s\ndaughter.”\n“I’m not young enough to be your niece,” Marasi said. “At least not one\nwho…” She trailed off as Wayne scrunched his face up good, emphasizing\nwrinkles, and brought out his fake mustache. “… Right,” she added. “I’d\nforgotten about that.”\n“Now, my dear,” Wayne said, “while I am distracting the employees of\nthis fine establishment with a depository request, you shall steal into their\nrecords room and acquaint yourself with the requisite information. It\nshouldn’t test your skills, as I shall regale them with descriptions of my\nwealth and prestige, which should draw the attention of most who are still\nworking at this late hour.”\n“Wonderful,” Marasi said.\n“As an aside, my dear,” Wayne added, “I am not fond at all of your\ndalliance with that farmhand upon our estate. He is far beneath you in\nstature, and your indiscretion will surely besmirch our good name.”\n“Oh please.”\n“Plus he has warts,” Wayne added as they reached the top of the steps.\n“And is prone to extreme bouts of flatulence. And—”\n“Are you going to talk about this the entire time?”\n“Of course! The bank’s employees need to know how I toil with the next\ngeneration and its woefully inadequate ability to make decisions my\ngeneration found simple and obvious.”\n“Grand,” Marasi said, pushing through the bank’s broad glass doors.\nA banker immediately rushed up to them. “I’m sorry. We’re very near\nclosing.”\n“My good man!” Wayne began. “I’m certain you can make time for the\ninvestment opportunity you will soon find present in—”\n“We’re from the Elendel Constabulary,” Marasi interrupted, taking out her\nengraved credential plate and holding it up. “Captain Marasi Colms.

That … that was cheating!\n“What records do you need?” the banker asked guardedly.\n“Do any of these people have accounts with you?” Marasi asked,\nproffering a paper.\n“I suppose I can check…” the banker said. He sighed and walked farther\ninto the building to where a clerk sat going over ledgers. He slid through a\ndoor behind the desk, and Wayne could hear him muttering to himself in the\nroom beyond.\n“Now I’ve gotta say,” Wayne said, pulling off the top hat, “that was the\nworst example of actin’ I’ve ever seen. Who would believe that the rich\nuncle has a constable for a niece, anyway?”\n“There’s no need to lie when the truth will work just as well, Wayne.”\n“No need … Of course there’s need! Why, what happens when we have to\nthump some people, then run off with their ledgers? They’re gonna know it\nwas us, and Wax’ll have to pay a big heap of compensatory fines.”\n“Fortunately, we’re not going to be thumping anyone.”\n“But—”\n“No thumping.”\nWayne sighed. Fat lot of fun this was going to be.\n* * *\n“I’ll have you know that we take the privacy of our patrons very seriously,”\nthe banker explained, hand protectively on the ledgers he’d retrieved from\nthe records room. They sat in his office now, and he had a little desk plaque\nthat named him . Neither of the others seemed to grasp why Wayne\nMR. ERIOLA\nsnickered when he read that.\n“I understand,” Marasi said, “but I have a healthy suspicion one of these\nmen is a criminal. Certainly you don’t want to abet their activities.”\n“I don’t want to violate their trust in me either,” the banker said. “What\nmakes you so certain these men are criminals? Do you have any proof?”\n“The proof,” Marasi said, “will be in the numbers.” She leaned forward.\n“Do you know how many crimes can be proven by looking at statistics?”\n“Considering the question, I’m going to assume it’s a nontrivial number,”\nthe banker said, leaning back in his chair and lacing his hands on his ample\nbelly.\n“Er, yes,” Marasi said. “Most crimes can be traced to either passion or\nwealth. Where wealth is involved, numbers come into play—and where\nnumbers come into play, forensic accounting gives us answers.”\nThe banker didn’t seem convinced—but then, in Wayne’s estimation, he\ndidn’t seem completely human either. He was at least part dolphin. The man\ncontinued plying Marasi with questions, obviously stalling for some reason.\nThat made Wayne uncomfortable. Usually when people stalled like that, it\nwas so their mates could have time to arrive and administer a proper beating.\nHe bided his time playing with objects on the banker’s desk, trying to\nbuild a tower of them, but he kept his eyes on the door.

Those things cost a clip\nevery five words to send, they do. Old Reddi wasted good money libelin’\nme.”\n“Technically, it’s defamation,” Marasi said.\n“Yup,” Wayne said, “manure, through and through.”\n“Defamation, Wayne, not … Oh, never mind.” She met the eyes of the\nbanker. “Are you satisfied?”\n“I suppose,” he said, then slid the ledgers over to her.\n“Numbers,” Marasi said, digging in her purse for a moment. She brought\nout a small book and tapped it with one finger. “This contains a list of the\ncommon wages for workers in the cemetery business, by the job they do.”\nShe pulled open the ledgers. “Now, looking at the deposits by our men in\nquestion, we can find patterns. Who is putting more money in the bank than\ntheir payroll would reasonably account for?”\n“Surely this isn’t enough to convict a man,” the banker said.\n“We’re not looking to convict,” Marasi said, looking through the first\nledger. “I just need a little direction.…”\nIn the minutes that followed, Wayne got his tower to balance with six\nseparate items, including the stapler, which left him feeling rather proud.\nEventually, Marasi tapped on one of the ledgers.\n“Well?” the banker asked. “Did you find your culprit?”\n“Yes,” Marasi said, sounding disturbed. “All of them.”\n“… All of them.”\n“Every rotten one,” Marasi said. “No pun intended.” She took a deep\nbreath, then slapped the ledger closed. “I guess I could have picked one at\nrandom, Mister Eriola. But still, it is good to know.”\n“To know what?”\n“That they’re all crooked,” she said, and started fishing in her purse again.\n“I should have guessed. Most corpses are buried with something valuable, if\nonly the clothing. No use letting that all rot away.”\nThe banker paled. “They’re selling the clothing off the dead people.”\n“That,” Marasi said, slipping a small bottle of Syles brandy out of her\npurse and setting it on the table, “and perhaps any jewelry or other personal\neffects buried with the bodies.”"

That would sure hit\nme well, like a morning piss after a nine-pinter the night afore.”\n“That’s horrible!” the banker said.\n“Yes,” Marasi said, “but if you think about it, not too horrifying. The only\ncrimes being perpetrated here are against the dead, and their legal rights are\nquestionable.”\nWayne fished in his pocket a moment, then brought out a silver letter\nopener. Where did he get that? He set it on the table and took the drink,\ndowning it in one shot.\n“Thank you for your time, Mister Eriola,” Marasi continued, taking the\nletter opener and sliding it toward the banker. “You’ve been very helpful.”\nThe banker looked at the letter opener with a start, then checked his desk\ndrawer. “Hey, that’s mine,” he said, reaching into the desk and pulling out\nsomething that looked like a piece of cord. “Is this … a rat’s tail?”\n“Longest I ever seen,” Wayne said. “Quite a prize. Lucky man, you are.”\n“How in the world did you…” The banker looked from Wayne to Marasi,\nthen rubbed his head. “Are we finished here?”\n“Yes,” Marasi said, standing. “Let’s go, Wayne.”\n“Off to make an arrest?” the banker said, dropping the tail into the\nwastebasket, which was a crime in and of itself. The thing was almost two\nhands long!\n“Arrest?” Marasi asked. “Nonsense, Mister Eriola. We aren’t here to arrest\nanyone.”\n“Then what was the point of all that?”\n“Why,” Marasi said, “I had to know whom to employ, of course. Come\nalong, Wayne.”\n12\nSo little had changed since Wax’s youth. Oh, the people at this party wore\nslightly different clothing: formal waistcoats had grown stouter, and\nhemlines had risen to midcalf while necklines had plunged, with mere bits of\ngauze draping across the neck and down the shoulders.\nThe people, though, were the same. They weighed him, calculating his\nworth, hiding daggers behind ready smiles. He met their condescending\nnods, and didn’t miss his guns as much as he would have thought. Those\nwere not the right weapons for this fight.\n“I used to be so nervous at these things,” Wax said softly to Steris. “When\nI was a kid. That was when I still cared about their opinions, I guess. Before\nI learned how much power over a situation you gain when you decide that\nyou don’t care what others think of you.”\nSteris eyed a couple of passing ladies in their completely laceless gowns.\n“I’m not certain I agree. How you are perceived is important. For example,\nI’m regretting my choice of gown. I was shooting for fashionable, but\nfashion is different down here. I’m not in style; I’m avant-garde.”\n“I like it,” Wax said. “It stands out.”\n“So does a pimple,” Steris said. “Why don’t you get us some drinks, and"

The grand ballroom was carpeted and adorned\nwith golden chandeliers—though their candleholders glowed with electric\nlights. The ceiling wasn’t terribly high, but the walls were colorfully\ndecorated with false archways that each held a mural. Classical pieces, like\nthe Ascendant Warrior rising above a flock of ravens—the typical depiction\nof the Lord Ruler’s wraiths, of whom only Death himself remained.\nThough nobody approached him, they also didn’t avoid him. If anything\nthey remained determinedly in his path, refusing to budge—then acted like\nthey hadn’t noticed him as he wove around them. He was from Elendel, their\npolitical enemy, and in not moving they made a statement.\nRusts, he hated these games.\nThe bar covered almost the entire length of the far wall, and was serviced\nby at least two dozen bartenders, so as to make absolutely certain none of the\nvery important guests had to wait. He ordered wine for Steris and a simple\ngin and tonic for himself, which got him a raised eyebrow. Apparently that\nwasn’t fancy enough. Should have ordered straight-up whiskey.\nHe turned and scanned the room as the bartender prepared the drinks. Soft\nmusic by a harpist helped cover the many conversations. It made him\nuncomfortable to admit that some of the casual discussions in a room like\nthis could do more to affect the lives of the Basin’s people than putting any\ncriminal—no matter how vile—in prison.\nMarasi is always talking about things like that, he thought. How the\nlawkeeping of the future will be about statistics, not shotguns. He tried to\nimagine a world where murders were prevented by careful civic planning,\nand found himself unable to see it. People would always kill.\nStill, sometimes it was hard not to feel like the one chandelier in the room\nthat still required candles.\n“Your order, my lord,” the bartender said, setting the drinks down on\nfancy cloth napkins, each embroidered with the date of the party. Those\nwould be for the attendees to take as keepsakes.\nWax fished a coin from his pocket for a tip and slid it to the bartender. He\ngrabbed his drinks to head back to Steris, but the bartender cleared his\nthroat. The man held up the coin, and it was not a fivespin as Wax had meant\nto give him. In fact, it was unlike any coin Wax had ever seen.\n“Was this a mistake, my lord?” the man asked. “I don’t mean to be\nungrateful, but I’d hate to take something that looks like a memento.”\nThe symbols on that coin … Wax thought, stepping back to the bar.\nThey’re the same ones as on the walls in the pictures ReLuur took. He nearly\noverturned the wineglass of another guest in his haste to grab the coin back.\nHe absently shoved the bartender another tip and held up the coin.\nThose were the same symbols, or very similar.

The\nlarge coin was made of two different metals, an outside ring and an inner\none.\nThe coin certainly didn’t seem old. Was it new, or merely well-preserved?\nRust and Ruin … how had this gotten into his pocket?\nThe beggar tossed it to me, Wax thought. But where had he gotten it?\nWere there more of these in circulation?\nTroubled, he struck out to find Steris. As he walked, he passed Lady\nKelesina, the party’s hostess and the woman who was his eventual target.\nThe older woman stood resplendent in a gown of black and silver, holding\nminiature court before a group of people asking after one of her civic\nprojects.\nWax listened in for a moment, but didn’t want to confront the woman yet.\nHe eventually located Steris standing beside a tall, thin table near the corner.\nThere weren’t any chairs in the ballroom. No dancing either, though there\nwas a dance floor raised an inch or two in the center of the chamber.\nWax set the coin on the table and slid it to Steris.\n“What’s this?” she asked.\n“The coin that the beggar threw at me. Those symbols look similar to the\nones in the pictures ReLuur took.”\nSteris pursed her lips, then turned the coin over and looked at the other\nside. “A face with one eye spiked through. Does it mean something?”\n“No idea,” Wax said. “I’m more interested in how that beggar got it—and\nwhy he threw it at me. It has to be a relic ReLuur found at that temple. Could\nhe have lost it, or traded it to someone, in the city?”\nHe tapped the table with one finger, certain now that beggar had been\nsomething more than he pretended. He was equally certain that if he went\nhunting now, he’d find that the man had vanished.\nEventually, Wax pocketed the coin. “We have to hope that the answers are\nin this room somewhere. Assuming Kelesina really is involved.”\n“Then it’s time get to work.”\n“I passed her back there. Shall we?”\n“Not yet. See that couple over there? The man has on a maroon\nwaistcoat.”\nWax followed her nod. The couple she indicated were young, well-\ndressed, and smug. Great.\n“That is Lord Gave Entrone,” Steris said. “Your houses have had some\nminor business dealings—he’s in textiles—which should give you an\nopening to speak with him.”\n“I’ve heard of him,” Wax said. “I courted a cousin of his once. It went\npoorly.”\n“Well, he’s also on the list your mad kandra made in his notebook, so he\nmight know something. He’s young, dynamic, and well-regarded—but not\nterribly important, so he’ll work nicely as a first try.”\n“Right,” Wax said, eyeing Entrone, who had drawn a crowd of several\nmore young women as he told a story that involved lots of gesturing. He\ntook a deep breath. “You want to take the lead?”\n“It should be you.”\n“You sure? I can’t help feeling I’d be better put to use with Marasi and"

I can’t help feeling I’d be better put to use with Marasi and\nWayne, digging in graves—while you are comfortable here. You’re good at\nthese things, Steris. You really are—and don’t give me any more of your\nrhetoric about being ‘boring.’”\nHer expression grew distant. “In this case, it’s not that I’m boring, it’s\nmore that … I’m off. I’ve learned to fake being normal, but lists of prepared\ncomments and jokes can only take me so far. People can sense that I’m not\nbeing authentic—that I don’t like the things they like or think the way they\ndo. Sometimes it amazes me that people like Wayne, or even those kandra,\ncan be so startlingly human when I feel so alien.”\nHe wished he could figure out how to keep her from saying things like\nthat. He didn’t know the right words; every time he tried to argue the point,\nit only seemed to make her withdraw.\nSteris held out an arm to him. He took it, and together they crossed the\nroom toward Lord Gave and the small crowd he had drawn. Wax had\nworried about how to break into the conversation, but as soon as he neared,\nthe people talking to Gave stepped back and made room for him. His\nreputation and status preceded him, apparently.\n“Why, Lord Waxillium!” Gave said with a knowing smile. “I was\ndelighted when I heard that you were going to attend our little gathering!\nI’ve wanted to meet you for years.”\nWax nodded to him, then to his date and a couple he’d been chatting with.\nThose two didn’t retreat.\n“How are you finding New Seran, my lord?” one of the ladies asked him.\n“Seems mighty inconvenient to get around,” Wax said. “Nice otherwise,\nthough.”\nThey laughed at that, as if he’d said something humorous. He frowned.\nWhat had he missed?\n“I’m afraid,” Gave said, “you won’t find much to interest you here. New\nSeran is a quiet city.”\n“Oh, but what are you saying, Lord Gave!” the other young man said.\n“Don’t misrepresent our town. The nightlife here is fantastic, Lord\nWaxillium! And the symphony has been given a citation of excellence by\ntwo of your previous governors.”\n“Yes,” Gave said, “but there aren’t many shoot-outs.”\nThe others gave him blank stares.\n“I was a lawman,” Wax told them, “in the Roughs.”\n“A…” one of the ladies said. “You oversaw a city’s constable precinct?”\n“No, he was a real lawman,” Gave said. “The ‘ride a horse and shoot\nbandits’ type. You should read the accounts—they’re all the rage in the\nElendel broadsheets.”\nThe three others regarded him with bemused expressions. “How …\nunique,” one of the ladies finally said.\n“The accounts are exaggerated,” Steris said quickly. “Lord Waxillium has\nonly been directly responsible for the deaths of around a hundred people.\nUnless you include those who died of infection after he shot them—I’m still\nnot sure how to count those.”\n“It was a difficult life,” Wax said, looking toward Gave, who smiled"

For a man like him, Wax and Steris\nwere obviously good sport. “But that is behind me now. Lord Gave, I wanted\nto thank you for our years of mutually profitable trade.”\n“Oh, don’t bring business into it, Lord Waxillium!” Gave said, with a tip\nof his wine. “This is a party.”\nThe others laughed. Again, Wax had no idea why.\nDamn, he thought, looking between them. I am rusty. He’d complained,\ndragged his feet, but he hadn’t expected to be this clumsy.\nFocus. Gave knew something about the Bands of Mourning, or at least\nReLuur had thought he did.\n“Do you have any hobbies, Lord Gave?” Wax asked, earning an eager nod\nfrom Steris at the comment.\n“Nothing of real note,” Gave said.\n“He loves archaeology!” his date said at the same time though. He gave\nher a dry look.\n“Archaeology!” Wax said. “That’s hardly unnotable, Lord Gave.”\n“He loves relics!” the lady said. “Spends hours at the auction house,\nsnatching up anything he—”\n“I like history,” Gave interjected. “Artwork from times past inspires me.\nBut you, dear, are making me sound too much like one of those gentlemen\nadventurers.” He sneered at the term. “I’m sure you saw the type up in the\nRoughs, Lord Waxillium. Men who’d spent their lives in society, but\nsuddenly decided to go off seeking some kind of thrill or another where they\ndon’t belong.”\nSteris stiffened. Wax met the man’s gaze levelly. The insult, veiled though\nit was, was similar to those he’d suffered in Elendel society.\n“Better they try something new,” Wax said, “as opposed to wasting their\nlives in the same old activities.”\n“My Lord Waxillium!” Gave said. “Disappointing one’s family is hardly\noriginal! People have been doing it since the days of the Last Emperor.”\nWax made a fist at his side. He was accustomed to insults, but this one\nstill got under his skin. Perhaps it was because he was on edge, or perhaps it\nwas because of his worry about his sister.\nHe pushed down his anger, Steris squeezing his arm, and tried another\ntactic. “Is your cousin well?”\n“Valette? Most certainly. We are all pleased with her new marriage. I’m\nsorry your relationship didn’t work out, but the man who courted her after\nyou was dreadful. When titles are part of a union, it’s always unpleasant to\nsee what crawls out from the mists looking for a bone.”\nHe didn’t look at Steris as he said it. He didn’t need to. That sly smile, so\nself-satisfied as he sipped his wine.\n“You rat,” Wax growled. “You rusting, spineless rat.” He reached for his\ngun, which—fortunately—wasn’t there.\nThe other three young nobles looked to him, shocked.

Gave grinned in a\ncocky way before adopting an expression of outrage. “Excuse me,” he said,\nturning his date by the arm and striding away.

When that didn’t work, he flung one at you, knowing I’d\noverreact.”\n“Hmmm…” Steris said. “Yes, you have the right of it.” Steris nodded.\nOther people nearby made conversation, but they left an open space around\nWax and Steris.\n“I’m sorry,” Wax said. “I let him get to me.”\n“That’s why we tried him first,” Steris said. “Good practice. And we did\nlearn something. The archaeology comment prodded too close to something\nhe didn’t want to discuss. He turned to veiled insults to distract us.”\nWax took a deep breath, shoving away his annoyance at this entire\nsituation. “What now? Do we try another one?”\n“No,” Steris said, thoughtful. “We don’t want our targets to know that\nwe’re approaching them specifically. If you interact with unaffiliated people\nin between, our pattern will be more difficult to spot.”\n“Right,” Wax said, looking through the busy hall as the harpist retreated\nand a full band, with brass—something you’d never see at a party in Elendel\n—began setting up instruments in her place.\nHe and Steris sipped drinks as the music started. Though it was slow\nenough to encourage dancing with a partner, there was a pep to it Wax hadn’t\nexpected. He found he quite liked it. It seemed to be able to beat out his\nfrustration, turn it to something more excited instead.\n“Why don’t you go there next?” Steris said, nodding toward a\ndistinguished older woman with her grey hair in a bun. “That’s Lady Felise\nDemoux, accompanied by her nephew. You’ve had business dealings with\nher; she’s exactly the sort of person you’d be expected to seek out. I’ll refill\nour drinks.”\n“Get me a seltzer,” Wax said. “I’ll need my mind clear for this.”\nSteris nodded, moving off through the crowd as people made way for\ndancing in the center of the room. Wax approached Lady Demoux and\nintroduced himself with a card given to her nephew, then requested a dance,\nwhich was accepted.\nSmall talk. He could do small talk. What is wrong with you, Wax? he\nthought at himself as he accompanied Lady Demoux to the dance floor. You\ncan interrogate a criminal without trouble. Why do you dread simple\nconversation?\nPart of him wanted to dismiss it as mere laziness. But that was his\nresponse to everything he didn’t want to do—an excuse. What was it really?\nWhy was he so reluctant?\nIt’s because these are their rules. If I play by them, I accept their games.

However,\nas he did, a different woman slid into place and grasped his hand, towing\nhim into the dancing and away from the perimeter. He was so surprised that\nhe let it happen.\n“Excuse me?” Wax said.\n“No excuses necessary,” the woman said, “I won’t take but a moment of\nyour time.” She looked to be Terris, judging by her dark skin—though hers\nwas darker than most he’d seen. Her hair was in tight braids, streaked with\ngrey, and her face bore full, luscious lips. She took the lead in the dance,\ncausing him to stumble.\n“You realize,” she said, “that you are a very rare specimen. Crasher: a\nCoinshot and a Skimmer.”\n“Neither are that rare,” Wax said, “in terms of Metalborn.”\n“Ah, but any Twinborn combination is rare indeed. Mistings are one in a\nthousand; most Ferrings even more unusual, and their bloodlines\nconstrained. To arrive at any specific combination of two is highly\nimprobable. You are one of only three Crashers ever born, Lord Waxillium.”\n“What, really?”\n“I cannot, of course, be one hundred percent certain of that figure. Infant\nmortality on Scadrial is not as bad as some regions, but still shockingly high.\nTell me, have you ever tried increasing your weight while in midair?”\n“Who are you?” Wax said, stepping into the dance and seizing back\ncontrol, twisting her to his right.\n“Nobody important,” she said.\n“Did my uncle send you?”\n“I have little interest in your local politics, Lord Waxillium,” she replied.\n“If you would kindly answer my questions, I will let you be.”\nHe turned with her to the music. They danced more quickly than he was\naccustomed to, though the steps were familiar. The constant intrusion of\nthose brass instruments drove the song, made his steps seem to spring. Why\nhad he mentioned his uncle? Sloppy.\n“I’ve increased my weight while moving,” he said slowly. “It doesn’t do\nanything—all things fall at the same speed, regardless of how heavy they\nare.”\n“Yes, the uniformity of gravitation,” the woman said. “That’s not what\nI’m curious about. What if you’re soaring through the air on a Steelpush and\nyou suddenly make yourself heavier. What happens?”\n“I slow down—I’m so much heavier that it’s harder to Push myself\nforward.”\n“Ahh…” the woman said softly. “So it is true.”\n“What?”\n“Conservation of momentum,” she said. “Lord Waxillium, when you store\nweight, are you storing mass, or are you changing the planet’s ability to\nrecognize you as something to attract? Is there a difference? Your answer\ngives me a clue. If you slow when you become heavier midflight, then that is\nnot likely due to you having trouble Pushing, but due to the laws of\nphysics.”\nShe stepped back from him in the middle of the dance, releasing his hands\nand sidestepping another couple, who gave them a glare for interfering with"

She produced a card and handed it toward him.\n“Please experiment with this further and send me word. Thank you. Now, if I\ncan just figure out why there’s no redshift involved in speed bubbles…”\nWith that she wandered off the floor, leaving him befuddled in the middle\nof the dancing. Suddenly conscious of how many stares he was drawing, he\nlifted his chin and sauntered off the dance floor, where he found Lady\nDemoux and apologized to her profusely for the interruption. She allowed\nhim to have the next dance, which passed without incident, save for Wax\nhaving to hear a protracted description of Lady Demoux’s prize-winning\nhounds.\nOnce done, he tried to find the strange woman with the braids, even going\nso far as to approach the doorkeeper and ask after her. The card had an\naddress in Elendel, but no name.\nThe doorman claimed he hadn’t admitted anyone by that description,\nwhich left Wax even more troubled. His uncle was trying to breed\nAllomancers. A woman asking after the specifics of Allomantic powers\ncouldn’t be a coincidence, could it?\nHe did pass MeLaan. Square-chinned, standing over six feet tall, her\nmasculine body bulged with muscles beneath her tuxedo, and she’d drawn a\ngaggle of interested young ladies. She winked at Wax as he passed, but he\ngave her no response.\nSteris had a drink waiting for him at the table, where she was flipping\nthrough pages of her notebook and mumbling. As Wax neared, he noticed a\nyoung man approach and try to engage her in conversation, but she\ndismissed him with a wiggle of her fingers, not even looking up. The man,\ndeflated, drifted away.\nWax stepped up to the table. “Not interested in dancing?”\n“What would be the point?” she said.\n“Well, I’m going out and dancing, so maybe you could too.”\n“You are lord of your house,” Steris said absently, still reading. “You have\npolitical and economic obligations. Anyone who would want to do the same\nwith me is simply trying to get to you, something for which I have no time.”\n“Either that,” Wax said, “or he thought you were pretty.”\nSteris looked up from her notes and cocked her head, as if the thought\nhadn’t even occurred to her. “I’m engaged.”\n“We’re new here,” Wax said, “largely unknown save to those who pay\nattention to Elendel politics. The lad probably didn’t know who you were.”\nSteris blinked very pointedly. She actually seemed troubled by the idea\nthat someone unknown might find her attractive. Wax smiled, reaching for\nthe cup she’d set out for him. “What is this?”\n“Soda water,” she said.\nHe held it up to the light. “It’s yellow.”\n“All the rage here, apparently,” Steris said. “With lemon flavoring.”\nWax took a drink, then nearly choked.\n“What?” Steris asked, alarmed. “Poison?”\n“Sugar,” Wax said. “About seven cups of it.”"

What was wrong with people in this city?\n“I’ve decided upon our next target,” Steris said, pointing toward a man\nacross the room leaning against the archway near some tanks of exotic fish.\nIn his thirties, he wore his jacket unbuttoned with a kind of purposeful\nsloppiness. Occasionally, someone else would approach and talk to him for a\nshort time, then move back out into the crowd.\n“They’re reporting to him?” Wax asked.\n“Devlin Airs,” Steris said with a nod. “Informant. You’ll find his sort at\nany party. He’s either one of the least important people in the room or one of\nthe most important, depending upon the secrets you’re interested in\ndiscovering. He was also on ReLuur’s list.”\nWax studied the man for a time, and when he looked back toward Steris,\nhalf of his fizzy yellow drink was gone. She looked innocently in the other\ndirection.\n“Probably best,” she said, “if you approach him alone. His type doesn’t\nlike an audience.”\n“All right,” Wax said, taking a deep breath.\n“You can do this, Lord Waxillium.”\nHe nodded.\n“I mean it,” Steris said, resting her hand on his. “Lord Waxillium, this is\nexactly what you’ve been doing for the last twenty years, in the Roughs.”\n“I could shoot people there, Steris.”\n“Could you really? Is that how you solved things? You couldn’t get\nanswers, so you shot somebody?”\n“Well, I’d usually just punch them.”\nShe gave him a raised eyebrow.\n“To be honest, no, I didn’t have to shoot—or punch—all that often. But\nthe rules were different. Hell, I could make the rules, if I needed to.”\n“Same goes here,” Steris said. “These people know things that you need to\nknow. You need to either trick them or trade with them. As you’ve always\ndone.”\n“Perhaps you’re right.”\n“Thank you. Besides, who knows? Maybe he’ll pull a knife on you, and\nyou’ll get an excuse to punch him anyway.”\n“Don’t get my hopes up,” he said, then gave her a nod, and walked across\nthe room.\n* * *\nThe gates to the Seran New District Cemetery were topped with a crouching\nstatue of the Survivor, scarred arms spread wide and gripping the metalwork\narch on either side. Marasi felt dwarfed by the statue’s looming intensity—\nbrass cloak tassels spreading out in a radial flare behind him, his metallic\nface glaring down at those who entered. A spear through his back pierced the\nfront of his chest, the polished tip emerging to hang a foot below the center\nof the arch.\nWhen she and Wayne passed beneath it, Marasi felt as if it should drip\nblood upon her.

She’d been raised Survivorist, so the\ngruesome imagery associated with the religion was familiar to her.\nIt was just that every time she saw a depiction of the Survivor, his posture\nseemed so demanding. It was like he wanted people to recognize the\ncontradiction in his religion. He commanded that people survive, yet the\ndeath imagery associated with him was a cruel reminder that they’d\neventually fail in that task. Survivorism therefore was not about winning, but\nabout lasting as long as you could before you lost.\nThe Survivor himself, of course, broke the rules. He always had. Doctrine\nexplained he was not dead, but surviving—and planning to return in their\ntime of greatest need. But if the end of the world hadn’t been enough to get\nhim to return in his glory, then what could possibly do so?\nThey wound through the graveyard, seeking the caretaker’s building.\nEvening had fallen, and the mists had decided to come out tonight. She tried\nnot to take that as any kind of sign, but it did make the place look extra\ncreepy. Gravestones and statues were shadowed in the churning mists. Some\nnights, she saw the mists as playful. Tonight their unpredictable motions\nseemed more a crowd of shifting spirits, watching her and Wayne, angered at\ntheir intrusion.\nWayne started whistling. That sent another shiver up Marasi’s spine.\nFortunately, the gravekeeper’s building was now only a short distance up the\npath—she could see its lights creating a bubble of yellow in the mists.\nShe stuck close to Wayne, not because she felt more comfortable having\nhim beside her. “Our target is a man named Dechamp,” she said. “Should be\nthe night gravekeeper, and one of those whose ledger entries show regular\nupticks in income. He’s grave robbing for sure. In fact, this cemetery showed\nthe highest frequency of that, and the ledgers listed it as the place the city\npays to take care of unidentified bodies. I’m reasonably certain the kandra’s\nremains ended up here; we just need to find this man and get him to dig for\nus.”\nWayne nodded.\n“This won’t be like with the banker,” Marasi said. “Who was reluctant,\nbut ultimately helpful.”\n“Really?” Wayne said. “Because I thought he was kind of a tit.…”\n“Focus, Wayne. We’ll have to use the full weight of the law here, to push\nthis man. I suspect we’ll have to offer clemency to get him to help us.”\n“Wait, wait,” Wayne said, stopping on the path, tendrils of mist curling\naround his brow, “you’re gonna flash your goods at him too?”\n“I really wish you wouldn’t phrase it that way.”\n“Now, listen,” Wayne said softly, “you were right ’bout the banker. You\ndid damn good work in there, Marasi, and I’m not too proud to admit it. But\nauthority works different out here in the world of regular men. You bring out\nyour credentials with this fellow, and I guarantee he’s gonna react like a\nrabbit. Find the nearest hole, hunker down, not say a word.”\n“Good interrogation techniques—”"

Find the nearest hole, hunker down, not say a word.”\n“Good interrogation techniques—”\n“Ain’t worth beans if you’re in a hurry,” Wayne said, “which we are. I’m\nputtin’ my foot down.” He hesitated. “’Sides, I already lifted your\ncredentials.”\n“You…” Marasi started, then rummaged through her purse and discovered\nthat the small, engraved plate that held her constable’s credentials was gone,\nreplaced with an empty bottle of Syles brandy. “Oh please. This isn’t worth\nnearly the same as those credentials.”\n“I know I gave you a good deal,” Wayne said. “’Cuz yours is only a bit of\nuseless metal—which is about what it’d be worth here, in this cemetery.”\n“You will give the credentials back after we’re done.”\n“Sure. If you fill that bottle in trade.”\n“But you said—”\n“Convenience fee,” Wayne said, then looked up the path toward the\ngravekeeper’s building. He took his top hat off and stomped on it.\nMarasi stepped back, hand to her breast, as Wayne ground the hat beneath\nhis heel, then brought it up and twisted it the other way. Finally, after\ninspecting it critically, he pulled a knife off his metalbelt and cut a hole in\nthe hat’s side. He tossed aside his duster and cut off one of the straps of his\nsuspenders.\nWhen the top hat went back on his head, he looked shockingly like a\nvagrant. Of course, he was always one step from that, but it was still\nsurprising how much of a difference two little changes could make. He spun\nthe knife in his hand and inspected Marasi with a critical eye. The sun had\nset completely, but with the light of the city diffusing through the mists, it\ncould actually be brighter on a night like this than on one without any mist.\n“What?” Marasi said, uncomfortable.\n“You look too fancy,” Wayne said.\nMarasi glanced down at herself. She wore a simple, sky-blue day dress,\nhem at midcalf, laced up the sleeves and neck. “This is pretty ordinary,\nWayne.”\n“Not for what we’ll be doin’.”\n“I can be your employer or something.”\n“Men like this don’t open up none if there’s someone respectable about.”\nHe spun the knife in his hand, then reached for her chest.\n“Wayne!” she said.\n“Don’t be so stiff. You want this done right, right?”\nShe sighed. “Don’t get too frisky.”\n“Sooner get frisky with a lion, Mara. That I would.”\nHe cut the opaque lace window out of her bodice, leaving her with a\nplunging neckline. Her sleeves went next, shortened by a good foot to above\nthe elbow. He took the lace there and tied it like a ribbon around her dress\nright beneath her breasts, then pulled the laces on the back of the dress more\ntightly. That lifted and thrust her upper chest outward in a decidedly\nscandalous way.\nFrom there, he made a few choice slits on the skirt before rubbing dirt on\nthe bottom parts. He stepped back, tapping his cheek thoughtfully, and\nnodded."

He stepped back, tapping his cheek thoughtfully, and\nnodded.\nMarasi looked down, inspecting his handiwork, and was actually\nimpressed. Beyond enhancing the bust, he’d cut along seams, pulling out\nthreads, and the effect wasn’t so much ruined as used.\n“Everyone looks at the chest first,” Wayne said, “even women, which is\nkinda strange, but that’s the way it is. Like this, nobody will care that the dirt\nlooks too fresh and the rest of the dress ain’t aged properly.”\n“Wayne, I’m shocked,” she said. “You’re an excellent seamstress.”\n“Clothes is fun to play with. Ain’t no reason that can’t be manly.” His\neyes lingered on her chest.\n“Wayne.”\n“Sorry, sorry. Just gettin’ into character, you know.” He waved for her to\nfollow, and they headed up the path. As they did, Marasi realized something.\nShe wasn’t blushing.\nWell, that’s a first, she thought, growing strangely confident.\n“Try not to open your mouth much,” Wayne advised as they approached\nthe hut. “On account of you normally soundin’ way too smart.”\n“I’ll see what I can do.”\nHe snapped a branch off a tree they passed, spun it around his finger, then\nheld it down before himself like a gnarled cane. Together they approached\nthe glowing building: a small, thatched structure that had a few weathered\nmistwraith statues sticking up from its mossy yard. The statues—made in the\nform of skeletons with skin pulled tight across the skulls—were traditionally\nthought to ward away the real things, as mistwraiths could be very territorial.\nMarasi suspected the creatures could tell the difference between real and\nstone members of their species—but of course, scientists claimed that the\nmistwraiths hadn’t even survived the Catacendre in the first place. So the\nquestion was probably moot.\nA greasy little man with a blond ponytail whistled to himself beside the\nhut, sharpening his shovel with a whetstone. Who sharpens a shovel? Marasi\nthought as Wayne presented himself, chest thrust out, improvised cane\nbefore him as if he were some grand attendee at a ball.\n“And are you,” Wayne said, “bein’ the one called Dezchamp?”\n“Dechamp,” the man said, looking up lazily. “Now, now. Did I leave that\ngate open again? I am supposed to be closin’ the thing each night. I’ll have\nto be askin’ you to leave this premises, sir.”\n“I’ll make my way out, then,” Wayne said, pointing with his cane-stick,\nyet not moving. “But afore I go, I would like to make you aware of a special\nbusiness proposition regardin’ you and me.”\nWayne had exaggerated his accent to the point that Marasi had to pay\nstrict attention to make out what he was saying. Beyond that, there was a\nmore staccato sense to it. More stressed syllables, more of a rhythm to the\nsentences. It was, she realized, very similar to the accent the gravekeeper\nwas using."

It was, she realized, very similar to the accent the gravekeeper\nwas using.\n“I’m a honest man, I am,” Dechamp said, drawing his whetstone along his\nshovel. “I don’t have no business I needs to discuss, particularly not at a time\nof night like this one here.”\n“Oh, I’ve heard of your honesty,” Wayne said, rolling back on his heels,\nhands on his cane before him. “Heard it spoken of from one street to the\nnext. Everyone’s talkin’ ’bout your honesty, Dechamp. It’s a right keen topic\nof interest.”\n“If everyone’s sayin’ so much,” Dechamp replied, “then you’ll know I\nalready got plenty of people with whom to share my honesty. I’m …\ngainfully contracted.”\n“That don’t matter none for our business.”\n“I do think it might.”\n“See, it won’t,” Wayne said, “on account of my needin’ only one special\nlittle item, that nobody else would find of interest.”\nDechamp looked Wayne up and down. Then he eyed Marasi, and his eyes\nlingered as Wayne had said they would. Finally Dechamp smiled and stood,\ncalling into the hut. “Boy? Boy!”\nA child scrambled out into the mists, bleary-eyed and wearing a dirty\nsmock and trousers. “Sir?”\n“Go and kindly do a round of the yard,” Dechamp said. “Make sure we\nain’t disturbed.”\nThe boy grew wide-eyed, then nodded and scampered off into the mists.\nDechamp rested his shovel on his shoulder, pocketing the whetstone. “Now,\nwhat can I be callin’ you, good sir?”\n“Mister Coins will do,” Wayne said. “And I’ll be callin’ you Mister Smart\nMan, for the decision you just made right here and now.”\nHe was changing his accent. It was subtle, but Marasi could tell he’d\nshifted it faintly.\n“Nothing is set as of yet,” Dechamp said. “I just like to give that boy some\nexercise now and then. Keeps his health.”\n“Of course,” Wayne said. “And I understand completely that nothing has\nbeen promised. But I tell you, this thing I want, ain’t nobody else goin’ to\ngive you a clip for it.”\n“If that’s so, then why are you so keen for it?”\n“Sentimental value,” Wayne said. “It belonged to a friend, and it was\nreally hard for him to part with it.”\nMarasi snorted in surprise at that one, drawing Dechamp’s attention.\n“Are you the friend?”\n“I don’t speak skaa,” she said in the ancient Terris language. “Could you\nperhaps talk in Terris, please?”\nWayne winked at her. “No use, Dechamp. I can’t get her to speak proper,\nno matter how much I try. But she’s fine to look at, ain’t she?”\nHe nodded slowly. “Iffen this item be under my watchful care, where\nmight it be found?”\n“There was a right tragic incident in town a few weeks back,” Wayne said.\n“Explosives. People dead. I hear they brought the pieces to you.”"

I hear they brought the pieces to you.”\n“Bilmy runs the day shift,” Dechamp said. “He brought ’em in. The ones\nwhat weren’t claimed, the city put in a nice little grave. They was mostly\nbeggars and whores.”\n“And right undeservin’ of death,” Wayne said, taking off his hat and\nputting it over his breast. “Let’s go see them.”\n“You want to go tonight?”\n“Iffen it ain’t too much a sweat.”\n“Not much sweat, Mister Coins,” Dechamp said, “but your name had\nbetter match your intentions.”\nWayne promptly got out a few banknotes and waved them. Dechamp\nsnatched them, sniffed them for some reason, then shoved them in his\npocket. “Well, those ain’t coins, but they’ll do. Come on, then.”\nHe took out an oil lantern, then led them into the mists.\n“You changed your accent,” Marasi whispered to Wayne as they followed\na short distance behind.\n“Aged it back a tad,” Wayne explained softly. “Used the accent of a\ngeneration past.”\n“There’s a difference?”\nHe looked shocked. “Of course there is, woman. Made me sound older,\nlike his parents. More authority.” He shook his head, as if he couldn’t\nbelieve she’d even asked.\nDechamp’s lantern reflected off the mists as they walked, and that actually\nmade it harder to see in the night, but he’d probably need it when digging. It\ndid little to dispel the eeriness of gravestones broken by the occasional\ntwisted mistwraith image. She understood, logically, why the tradition would\nhave grown up. If there was one place you wanted to keep scavengers away\nfrom, it would be the graveyard. Except that the place had its own set of\nhuman scavengers, so the statues weren’t working.\n“Now,” Dechamp said, and Wayne caught up to listen, “I’ll have you\nknow that I am an honest man.”\n“Of course,” Wayne said.\n“But I’m also a thrifty man.”\n“Ain’t we all,” Wayne said. “I never buys the fancy beer, even when it’s\nlast call and the bartender halves it to empty the barrel.”\n“You’re a man after my own heart, then,” Dechamp said. “Thrifty. What’s\nthe good of lettin’ things rot and waste away, I says. The Survivor, he didn’t\nwaste nothing useful.”\n“Except noblemen,” Wayne said. “Wasted a fair number o’ them.”\n“Wasn’t a waste,” Dechamp said, chuckling. “That there was weapons\ntesting. Gotta make sure your knives is workin’.”\n“Indeed,” Wayne said. “Why, sometimes the sharp ends on mine need\nlotsa testin’. To make sure they don’t break down in the middle of a good\nkillin’.”\nThey shared a laugh, and Marasi shook her head. Wayne was in his\nelement—he could talk about stabbing rich people all day long.

Never mind\nthat he himself was wealthier, now, than most of Elendel.\nShe didn’t much care to listen to them as they continued to laugh and\njoke, but unfortunately she also didn’t want to get too far away in this\ndarkness. Yes, the mists were supposed to belong to the Survivor, but rusts,\nevery second tombstone looked like a figure stumbling toward her in the\nnight.\nEventually the gravekeeper led them to a freshly filled grave tucked away\nbehind a few larger mausoleums. It was unmarked save for the sign of the\nspear, carved in stone and set into the dirt. Nearby, a few other new graves—\nthese open—awaited corpses.\n“You might want to grab a seat,” Dechamp said, hefting his shovel.\n“This’ll go fast, since the grave is upturned, but not that fast. And you might\ntell the lady to watch the other way. There’s no tellin’ what bits I might toss\nup.”\n“Grab a seat…” Wayne said, looking around at the field of tombstones.\n“Where, my good man?”\n“Anywhere,” Dechamp said, starting to dig. “They don’t care none. That’s\nthe motto of the gravekeeper, you know. Just remember, they don’t care\nnone.…”\nAnd he set to it.\n13\nI have to accept their rules, Wax thought, crossing the room to the\ninformant. They’re different, no matter what Steris says. But I do know them.\nHe’d decided to stay in the Basin and do what he could here. He’d seen\nthe dangers on the streets of Elendel, and had worked to fight them. But\nthose were a lesser wound—it was like patching the cut while the rot\nfestered up the arm.\nChasing down the Set’s lesser minions … they probably wanted him\ndoing those things. If he was going to protect the people, he was going to\nhave to gun for more important targets. That meant keeping his temper, and\nit meant dancing and playing nice. It meant doing all the things his parents,\nand even his uncle, had tried to teach him.\nWax stopped near the alcove the informant, Devlin, occupied. The man\nwas watching the nearby fish tank, which stood beneath a depiction of\nTindwyl, Mother of Terris, perched on the walls during her last stand against\nthe darkness. In the tank, tiny octopuses moved across the glass.\nAfter a moment’s waiting, the informant nodded toward him. Wax\napproached and rested his arm against the glass of the tank beside Devlin, a\nshort, handsome man with a hint of hair on his upper lip and chin.\n“I expected you to be arrogant,” Devlin noted.\n“What makes you think that I’m not?”\n“You waited,” Devlin said.\n“An arrogant man can still be polite,” Wax said.\nDevlin smiled. “I suppose he can be, Lord Waxillium.” One of the little\noctopuses seized a passing fish in its tentacles and dropped from the side of\nthe tank, holding the squirming fish and pulling it up toward its beak.\n“They don’t feed them,” Devlin noted, “for a week or so before a party.\nThey like the show they provide.”\n“Brutal,” Wax said."

This Basin that Harmony\ncreated for us. So perfect, so lush. Nobody leaves.”\n“I did.”\n“To the Roughs,” Devlin said, dismissive. “What’s beyond them,\nWaxillium? Beyond the deserts? Across the seas? Nobody cares.”\n“I’ve heard it asked before.”\n“And has anyone put up the money to find the answers?”\nWax shook his head.\n“People can ask questions,” Devlin said, “but where there is no money,\nthere are no answers.”\nWax found himself chuckling, to which Devlin responded with a modest\nnod. He had developed a subtle way of explaining that he needed to be paid\nto give information. Oddly, despite the immediate—and somewhat crass—\ndemand, Wax found himself more comfortable here than he’d been with\nLord Gave.\nWax fished in his pocket and held out the strange coin. “Money,” he said.\n“I have an interest in money.”\nDevlin took it, then cocked an eyebrow.\n“If someone could tell me how this could be spent,” Wax noted, “I would\nbe enriched. Really, we all would be.”\nDevlin turned it over in his fingers. “Though I’ve never seen the exact\nimage on this one, coins like these have been moving with some regularity\nthrough black-market antiquities auctions. I’ve been baffled as to why. There\nis no reason to keep them secret, and it would not be illegal to sell them in\nthe open.” He flipped the coin back to Wax.\nHe caught it with surprise.\n“You didn’t expect me to answer so frankly,” Devlin said. “Why do\npeople so often ask questions when they’re not expecting answers?”\n“Do you know anything else?” Wax asked.\n“Gave bought a few,” Devlin said, “then immediately stopped, and the\npieces he purchased are no longer on display in his home.”\nWax nodded thoughtfully and dug into his pocket for some money to offer\nthe informant.\n“Not here,” Devlin said, rolling his eyes. “One hundred. Send a note of\ntransfer to your bank and have them move it to my account.”\n“You’d trust me?” Wax asked.\n“Lord Waxillium, it’s my job to know whom to trust.”\n“It will be done, then. Assuming you have a little more for me.”\n“Whatever is being covered up,” Devlin said, looking back toward the fish\ntank, “a good quarter of the nobility in the city is embroiled in it. First I was\ncurious; now I’m terrified. It involves a massive building project to the\nnortheast of here.”\n“What kind of building project?” Wax asked.\n“No way of knowing,” Devlin said. “Some farmers have seen it.

Where did Hemalurgy fit into all of\nthis?\nDevlin stood and nodded to Wax, extending a hand as if in farewell.\n“That’s it?” Wax asked.\n“Yes.”\n“Steep price for so little,” Wax said, taking the hand.\nDevlin leaned in, speaking softly, “Then let me give you a bit more. What\nyou’re involved in is dangerous, more than you can imagine. Get out. That’s\nwhat I’m doing.”\n“I can’t,” Wax said as Devlin pulled back.\n“I know you, lawman,” Devlin said. “And I can tell you, the group you\nchase, you don’t need to worry about them. They won’t be a danger for\ndecades, perhaps centuries. You’re ignoring the bigger threat.”\n“Which is?” Wax asked.\n“The rest of the people in this room,” Devlin said, “the ones not involved\nin your little conspiracy—the ones who care only about how their cities are\nbeing treated.”\n“Pardon,” Wax said, “but they don’t seem like nearly the same level of\ndanger to me.”\n“Then you aren’t paying attention,” Devlin said. “Personally, I’m curious\nto find out how many lives the Basin’s first civil war claims. Good day, Lord\nLadrian.” He walked away, snapping his fingers as he passed a few people.\nOne of them scuttled off to follow him.\nWax found himself growling softly. First that woman during the dancing,\nnow this fellow. Wax felt like he was being jerked around on the end of\nsomeone’s string. What had he even found out? Confirmation that artifacts\nwere being sold? So someone else had found the place that ReLuur had\nevanotyped?\nA building project, Wax thought. Allomancers.\nCivil war.\nFeeling cold, Wax moved back through the crowd. He rounded a group of\npeople, noting that Steris was gone from their table—though she’d finished\nhis cup of sweetened soda water before leaving. He turned and started\nthrough the crowd, looking for her.\nThat, by chance, brought him unexpectedly face-to-face with a statuesque\nwoman with her hair in a bun and a ring on each finger. “Why, Lord\nWaxillium,” Kelesina said, waving for her companions to withdraw, leaving\nher alone with Wax. “I was hoping to get a chance to speak with you.”\nHe felt an immediate spike of panic—which he shot in the head and"

He might not be in the Roughs, but he\ndidn’t intend to take his eyes off his enemy.\n“I hope you’ve been enjoying the party,” she said. “The main address is\nabout a half hour away; you might find it of note. We’ve invited the mayor\nof Bilming himself to speak. I’ll be certain to get you a transcript to bring\nback to your peasant governor, so that you needn’t worry about memorizing\nthe details.”\n“That’s very courteous of you.”\n“I—” she began.\nRusts, he was tired of letting someone else steer his conversation tonight.\n“Have you seen Lord Gave?” Wax interrupted. “I insulted him by accident\nearlier. I wish to make amends.”\n“Gave?” Kelesina said. “Don’t mind him, Waxillium. He’s hardly worth\nthe bother.”\n“Still,” Wax said. “I feel like I’m wearing blocks of concrete on my feet\nand trying to dance! Every step I take, I smash somebody’s toes. Rusts, I’d\nhoped that people down here wouldn’t be as touchy as they are in Elendel.”\nShe smiled. The words seemed to put her at ease, as if she were getting\nfrom him exactly what she expected.\nUse that, Wax told himself. But how? This woman had decades’ worth of\nexperience moving in social circles. Steris could opine all she wanted about\nhis virtues, but he’d spent years doing target practice instead of attending\nparties. How could he expect to match these people at their own game?\n“I’m sorry to see you didn’t bring your associate,” Kelesina said.\n“Wayne?” Wax asked, genuinely incredulous.\n“Yes. I’ve had letters regarding him from friends in Elendel. He seems so\ncolorful!”\n“That’s one way to put it,” Wax said. “Pardon, Lady Kelesina, but I’d\nsooner bring my horse to a party. It’s better behaved.”\nShe laughed. “You are a charmer, Lord Waxillium.”\nThis woman was guilty as sin, and he knew it. He could feel it. He did the\nnext part by instinct. He pulled the coin from his pocket and held it up.\n“Maybe you can answer something for me,” he said, and realized he’d\nstarted to let a Roughs accent slip into his voice. Thanks for that, Wayne. “I\nwas given this outside, by mistake I think. I asked some folks in here about\nit, and some of them got so pale in the face, I’d have thought they’d been\nshot.”\nKelesina froze.\n“Now personally,” Wax said, flipping it over, “I think it has to do with\nthose rumors of what’s happenin’ out northeast. Big dig in the ground, I’ll\nbet? Well, I figure this must be from that. Relic from the old days. Mighty\ninteresting, eh?”\n“Don’t be taken in by those rumors, Lord Waxillium,” she said. “After"

Mighty\ninteresting, eh?”\n“Don’t be taken in by those rumors, Lord Waxillium,” she said. “After\nstories circulated, people began coining things like those in the city to sell to\nthe gullible.”\n“Is that so?” Wax said, trying to sound disappointed. “That’s a shame. It\nsounded really interesting to me.” He pocketed the coin as the band started\nanother song. “Care for a dance?”\n“Actually,” she said, “I promised the next one already. Can I find you\nlater, Lord Waxillium?”\n“Sure, sure,” he said, then gave her a nod as she withdrew. He stepped\nback to his table, watching her move pointedly through the crowd with\nfrightened motions.\n“Was that Lady Kelesina?” Steris said, joining him, holding another cup\nof the sweetened yellow drink.\n“Yup,” Wax said.\n“I wasn’t planning to talk to her until after the speech,” Steris said,\nhuffing. “You’ve thrown off my entire timeline.”\n“Sorry.”\n“It will have to do. What did you discover from her?”\n“Nothing,” Wax said, still watching Lady Kelesina as she met with some\nmen in suits nearby. She kept her face calm, but the curt way she\nmotioned … yes, she sure was agitated. “I told her what I’d discovered.”\n“You what?”\n“I tipped her off that I was on to them,” Wax said, “though I tried to act\nstupid. I don’t know if she bought that part. Wayne’s far better than I am at\nit. He’s a natural, you see.”\n“You’ve ruined it then?”\n“Maybe,” Wax said. “But then, if this were the Roughs and I were\nconfronting a criminal—but had no evidence—this is what I’d do. Let it slip\nthat I was suspicious of them, then watch where they go.”\nLady Kelesina stalked from the hall, leaving one of the other men to give\napologies. Wax could almost hear them. The lady has a matter of some\nurgency to take care of at the moment. She will return shortly.\nSteris followed his gaze.\n“Ten notes says she’s gone to contact Suit,” Wax said, “and let him know\nthat I’m on to them.”\n“Ah,” Steris said.\nHe nodded. “I figured I couldn’t outtalk her, no matter how hard I tried.\nBut she’s not used to being chased by the law. She will make simple\nmistakes, ones that even a rookie stagecoach robber would never make.”\n“We’ll need to follow her somehow.”\n“That would be the plan,” Wax said, drumming his fingers on the table. “I\nmay have to start a fight and get thrown out.”\n“Lord Waxillium!” Steris said, then started fishing in her purse.\n“I’m sorry. I’m having trouble thinking of something else.” It was a weak\nplan though. Getting thrown out would likely alert Kelesina. “We need a\ndistraction, an excuse to leave. Something believable, but not too\ndisconcerting … What is that?”\nSteris had removed a small vial of something from her purse. “Syrup of"

        "text": "distraction, an excuse to leave. Something believable, but not too\ndisconcerting … What is that?”\nSteris had removed a small vial of something from her purse. “Syrup of\nipecac and saltroot,” she said. “To induce vomiting.”\nHe blinked in shock. “But why…”\n“I had assumed they might try to poison us,” Steris said. “Though I\nconsidered it only a small possibility, it’s best to be prepared.” She laughed\nuncomfortably.\nThen she downed the whole thing.\nWax reached for her arm, but too late. He watched in horror as she\nstoppered the empty vial and tucked it into her purse. “You might want to get\nout of the splash radius, so to speak.”\n“But … Steris!” he said. “You’ll end up humiliating yourself.”\nShe closed her eyes. “Dear Lord Waxillium. Earlier, you spoke of the\npower of not caring about what others thought of you. Do you remember?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, you see,” she said, opening her eyes and smiling, “I’m trying to\npractice that skill.”\nShe proceeded to vomit all over the table.\n* * *\nThe digging continued, and Marasi passed the time reading inscriptions on\ngravestones. Wayne, for his part, had settled down on a grave with his back\nto the stone, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. As she passed\nto check on the progress, she found him rummaging in his pocket. A moment\nlater, he pulled a sandwich out and started eating. When he saw Marasi\nstaring at him, he held it toward her, wagging it to see if she wanted a bite.\nFeeling sick, she turned away from him and sought out more grave\ninscriptions. This was obviously the poorer section of the yard; plots were\nclose together, and the markers were small and simple. The mist wove\nbetween them, curling around her as she knelt beside a stone, wiped off the\nmoss, and read the memorial left for the child buried here. Eliza Marin. 308–\n310. Ascend and be free.\nThe steady sound of the gravedigger’s shovel accompanied her as she\nmoved between the graves. Soon she was too far from the light to make out\nthe inscriptions. She sighed, turning, and found someone standing in the\nmists nearby.\nShe practically jumped out of her shoes, but the shifting mists—and the\nfigure’s too-steady posture—soon revealed this to be a statue. Marasi\napproached, frowning. Who had paid for a statue to be placed in the paupers’\nsection of the graveyard? It was old, having sunken a foot or so on the right\nside as the ground shifted, tipping the statue askew. It was also masterly, an\nextraordinary figure cut of gorgeous black marble standing some eight feet\ntall and resplendent in a sweeping mistcloak.\nMarasi rounded it, and was not surprised to find a feminine figure with\nshort hair and a petite, heart-shaped face. The Ascendant Warrior was here,\nsettled among the graves of the impoverished and the forgotten. Unlike\nKelsier’s statue, which had loomed over those who passed beneath his gaze,\nthis one seemed about to take flight, one leg raised, eyes toward the sky."

Who wouldn’t, after hearing the stories?” She’d even gone so far as\nto join the ladies’ target club because she figured if she couldn’t Push bits of\nmetal around, a gun was the closest she could get.\n“Were you ever insecure?” Marasi asked. “Or did you always know what\nto do? Did you get jealous? Frightened? Angry?”\nIf Vin had been an ordinary person at any point, the stories and songs had\nforgotten. They proclaimed her the Ascendant Warrior, the woman who had\nslain the Lord Ruler. A Mistborn and a legend who had carried the world\nitself upon her arms while Harmony prepared for divinity. She’d been able to\nkill with a glare, tease out secrets nobody else knew, and fight off armies of\nenraged koloss all on her own.\nExtraordinary in every way. It was probably a good thing, or the world\nwouldn’t have survived the War of Ash. But rusts … she left a hell of a\nreputation for the rest of them to try to live up to.\nMarasi turned from the statue and crossed the springy ground back to\nWayne and Dechamp. As she approached, the gravedigger climbed out and\nstuck his shovel into the earth, digging a flask from his pack and taking a\nprotracted swig.\nMarasi peeked into the grave. He had made good time—the earth had\nbeen dug out of the hole four feet deep.\n“Wanna share that with a fellow?” Wayne asked Dechamp, standing.\nDechamp shook his head, screwing the lid back on his flask. “My gramps\nalways said, never share your booze with a man who ain’t shared his with\nyou.”\n“But that way, nobody’d share their booze with anybody!”\n“No,” Dechamp said. “It just means I get twice as much.” He rested his\nhand on his shovel, looking into the grave. Without the steady rhythm of his\nwork, the graveyard was silent.\nThey had to be close to the bodies now. The next part would be unpleasant\n—sorting through the corpses for one that was in pieces, then checking that\nto see if it contained a spike. Her stomach churned at the thought. Wayne\ntook another bite of his sandwich, hesitated, and cocked his head.\nThen he grabbed Marasi under the arm and heaved, flipping her into the\ngrave. The impact knocked the breath out of her.\nGunfire sounded above a moment later.\n14\nMarasi gasped as Wayne slid into the shallow grave, flopping down square\non top of her. It knocked the wind out of her again.\nWayne grunted, and the gunshots stopped a moment later. Still trying to\nrecover, Marasi stared up at the black sky and swirling mist. It took her a\nmoment to realize that the mist was frozen in place.\n“Speed bubble?” she asked.\n“Yeah,” Wayne said, then groaned, twisting to the side and putting his\nback to the earthen wall so he wasn’t lying directly on her. His shoulder\nglistened with something wet.\n“You’ve been hit.”"

His shoulder\nglistened with something wet.\n“You’ve been hit.”\n“Three times,” Wayne said, then winced as he turned his leg. “No, four.”\nHe sighed, then took a bite of his sandwich.\n“So…”\n“Give me a sec,” he said.\nShe twisted in the grave and peeked up over the earthen lip. Nearby,\nDechamp fell slowly—as if through molasses—toward the ground, blood\nspraying from several gunshot wounds, droplets hanging in the air. A\nvanishing muzzle flash from the darkness revealed the origin of the gunfire:\na group of figures on the path, shadowed and nearly invisible. Bullets zipped\nthrough the mist, leaving trails.\n“How’d you know?” she asked.\n“They made the crickets stop,” Wayne said. “Dechamp musta sold us out.\nI’d bet Wax’s hat that he sent that boy to fetch these fellows.”\n“The Set was here first,” Marasi said, her stomach sinking.\n“Yeah.” Wayne poked at one of the holes in his shirt, wiggling it around to\ncheck that the wound had healed. With his other hand, he stuffed the last bite\nof sandwich into his mouth, then joined her in peeking up over the lip of the\ngrave. Above, a lethargically moving bullet hit the invisible edge of Wayne’s\nspeed bubble. In an eyeblink, it zipped across the air—barely a foot over\nMarasi’s head—before hitting the other side, where it slowed down again.\nShe cringed belatedly. Anytime something entered a speed bubble, it was\nrefracted, changing trajectory. While it was unlikely one would get bounced\nso radically that it would point downward toward them, it was possible.\nBeyond that, Wayne’s bendalloy burned extremely quickly. He’d have to\ndrop the bubble before too long.\n“Plan?” Marasi asked.\n“Not dyin’.”\n“Anything more detailed than that?”\n“Not dyin’ … today?”\nShe gave him a pointed look. Another pair of bullets zipped overhead\nwhile, outside the speed bubble, Dechamp’s body hit the ground.\n“We’ve gotta get close to them,” Wayne said, slipping one of his dueling\ncanes out from the loop on his belt.\n“That’s going to be hard,” Marasi said. “I think they’re scared of you.”\n“Yeah?” Wayne asked, sounding encouraged. “You really think?”\n“They’re unloading enough ammunition to take down a small army,”\nMarasi said, ducking as a bullet entered the speed bubble, “and they opened\nfire even though Dechamp was caught in the barrage. While I doubt he\nmeant much to them, it indicates they were scared enough that they didn’t\ndare waste a moment to wait for him to climb back into the grave.”\nWayne nodded slowly, grinning. “How ’bout that. I gots me a reputation. I\nwonder…”\nMarasi glanced behind them. This grave was near several others that had\nbeen left open earlier, waiting for occupants. “Can you get your speed\nbubble big enough to include one of those other graves from in here?”\nHe followed her gaze, then rubbed his chin. “The closest one maybe, if I"

Dechamp twitched, and he gasped, eyes\ngoing glassy in the lanternlight. Marasi waited until the assailants stopped\nshooting, the cracks of their guns echoing in the night. Then she leveled her\nlittle gun and squeezed off two shots toward the shadows.\nShe ducked back down, uncertain what that was supposed to have\naccomplished. “You realize we’re now trapped and unarmed, Wayne.”\n“Yup,” he said. “But if those fellows are really bothered by my fearsome\nreputation…”\n“What?” Marasi asked, glancing toward him as he peeked over the edge.\nA few cracks sounded as the dark figures fired back, but it wasn’t as frantic\nas before. What was …\n“There!” Wayne said, leaping toward the back of the grave and then\npopping up a speed bubble. “Ha! They came prepared, they did. Good men.”\nMarasi risked peeking up again. She came almost face-to-face with a\nspinning piece of dynamite frozen in the air, the wick spraying sparks and\nsmoke that mixed with the mists. She yelped, scrambling back. It was almost\nto the speed bubble.\n“Across we go,” Wayne said, taking off his top hat and tossing it out of\ntheir grave toward the next one. He scrambled after it. Marasi joined him,\nstaying low and hoping that the attackers wouldn’t notice. Wayne’s speed\nbubble would make them blurs to the eyes of the men, but it was dark and\nthe mists would help obscure things.\nShe slid across and down into the other grave, which was deeper than the\nfirst. Wayne nodded to her, then dropped the bubble.\nMarasi pressed her back to the side of the grave, squeezed her eyes shut,\nplugged her ears, and counted in her head. She only reached two before an\nexplosion shook the ground and dropped a wave of dirt into their grave.\nRusts! People must have heard that halfway across the city.\nShe glanced at Wayne, who took out his other dueling cane and twirled\none in each hand.

She heard footsteps scraping outside, and imagined the\nshadowy attackers cautiously creeping up to check on people they’d\nsupposedly killed.\nCan you beat them on your own? Marasi half whispered, half mouthed at\nWayne.\nHe grinned and mouthed back, Does a guy wif no hands got itchy balls?\nHe grabbed the side of the grave and hauled himself out. The mists above\nfroze a moment later as Marasi was caught in a speed bubble—Wayne,\nputting one up and trapping half the men nearby in it with him.\nShe was accustomed, by now, to the sound of wood on a man’s skull, but\nit still made her wince. The speed bubble dropped as someone managed to\nget a shot off, but more groaning and cursing followed.\nA short time later Wayne appeared at the top of the grave, backlit by the\nflickering lantern in the mists. He shoved his dueling canes into their loops,\nthen knelt and held out his hand.\nMarasi reached up to accept his help from the grave.\n“Actually,” Wayne said, not taking her hand, “I was hopin’ you’d hand me\nmy hat.”\n* * *\n“We’ll send for your carriage, Lord Waxillium,” said the assistant house\nsteward. “We’re terribly sorry about the unfortunate occasion of your lady’s\ndistress. You’re certain she ate nothing here that might disagree with her?”\n“She had only drinks,” Wax said, “and few of those at that.”\nThe cook relaxed visibly. She towed one of the maids away by the arm as\nsoon as she saw that Wax had noticed her. He stood in the doorway of a\nguest chamber, and behind him Steris lay on the bed, eyes closed.\nThe assistant steward—an aged Terriswoman in the proper robes—clicked\nher tongue softly, looking over her shoulder toward the vanishing cook and\nmaid. Despite her displeasure, Wax could tell that she too was relieved to\nhear that the food at the party couldn’t be blamed. No need for the other\nguests to worry.\nA piercing voice echoed down the hallway. Someone—a man with a high-\npitched tone—was announcing the reception’s speaker. Wax could hear\neasily; the introducer was assisted by electric amplifiers. It seemed the\nTarcsel girl’s devices had spread even to New Seran. The assistant steward\ntook an unconscious step back toward the ballroom.\n“Feel free to go,” Wax told her. “We’ll wait here for a half hour or so to be\ncertain my lady is well rested, and by then our carriage will certainly be\nwaiting.”\n“If you’re certain.…”\n“I am,” Wax said. “Just see to it that we’re not disturbed. Miss Harms\ngrows most discomforted by noises when she’s ill.”\nThe steward bowed and retreated down the hallway toward the ballroom.\nWax clicked the door closed, then approached the bed where Steris lay. She\ncracked an eye open, then glanced at the door to be sure it was closed.\n“How do you feel?” Wax asked.\n“Nauseated,” Steris said, half propping herself on one elbow. “That was a\ntad hasty on my part, wasn’t it?”"

I’m not certain\nhow long Kelesina will be away, but I’ll need to move quickly to learn\nanything.”\nSteris nodded. “Do you think they might have her here? Your sister, I\nmean.”\n“Unlikely,” Wax said. “But anything is possible. I’ll settle for a lead of\nany sort.”\n“What’s she like?”\n“She seemed like your average full-of-herself noblewoman. Certain that\n—”\n“Not Lady Kelesina, Waxillium. Your sister.”\n“I…” Wax swallowed, checking the clock. “I haven’t seen her in decades,\nSteris.”\n“But you work so eagerly to rescue her.”\nHe sighed, settling down beside Steris. “She was always the bold one,\nwhen we were kids. I was careful, earnest, trying so hard to figure out what\nto do. And Telsin … she seemed to have it all in hand. Until I left the Village\nand she stayed.”\n“More Terris than you, then.”\n“Maybe. I always thought she hated the place, considering how often she\nfound excuses to escape. Then she stayed.” He shook his head. “I never\nknew her, Steris. Not as I should have. I was too focused on myself. I can’t\nhelp feeling that I failed everyone—Mother, Father, Telsin herself—by not\nremaining close to her when I was out in the Roughs. And I’m failing them\nagain by leaving her under my uncle’s control.”\nSteris, still lying on the bed, squeezed his hand.\n“I’ll find her,” Wax said. “I’ll make it right. I ran to the Roughs, thinking I\ndidn’t need any of them. But as the years pass, Steris, I find I want less and\nless to be alone. I can’t explain it, I guess. She’s my family. My only family.”\nOutside, a new voice started talking. Introduction done, Lord Severington\nhad begun his speech. Wax glanced at the clock, then stood. “All right. I\nneed to go and explore while everyone else is distracted by the speech.”\nSteris nodded, then swung her feet over the side of the bed and took a\ndeep breath.\n“You should wait here,” Wax said. “This could be dangerous.”\n“Have you forgotten what I said last night?” she asked.\n“The safest place to be is most certainly not near me, Steris,” Wax said.\n“Regardless, you may need to escape quickly. There won’t be time to\ncome back for me. And if you’re spotted, someone will wonder why you are\nalone—but if we’re together, we can say we were just leaving, and were\nlooking for the way to our carriage.”\nThose were good arguments. He reluctantly nodded, motioning for her to\nfollow. She did so with alacrity, waiting beside the door as he opened it and\npeeked out.

He could hear Lord Severington’s voice even better.\n“… time to show those in Elendel that their tyranny is not only unjust, it is\nagainst the will of the Survivor, who died in the name of freedom.…”\nThe hallway was empty. Wax stepped out, Steris at his side. “Try not to\nlook like you’re sneaking,” he suggested softly.\nShe nodded, and together they moved down a long hallway set with brass\ngas lamps that had been converted to electricity. According to the mansion\nlayout he had memorized, the ballroom and these small guest quarters were\nin their own wing to the east. If they moved west along this hallway, took\nthis corner …\nThey passed under an archway into the mansion’s central atrium, where a\nstream ran through the center of the mansion—diverted from one of the\nwaterfalls, then cascading down a set of arranged rocks covered in chimes.\nOnly a few lights glowed on the walls, giving the atrium a dusklike feeling.\n“That humidity must be awful for the mansion’s woodwork,” Steris noted.\n“What practical reason could they have to run a river through the middle of\ntheir house?”\n“I’m sure the reasons aren’t practical at all,” Wax said. Nearby, a maid\npassed in from another doorway. She saw him and froze.\nWax glared at her, standing up straight, putting as much nobleman sneer\ninto his expression as he could muster. The young woman didn’t challenge\nthem, but ducked her head and scuttled away, carrying her stack of linens.\nThey picked their way through the dim atrium. Above, broad glass\nwindows would have given a view of the sky—but instead mist spun and\nswirled. Wax raised his fingers in greeting toward the distant mists, but\nstopped himself.\nHarmony watched through those mists. Harmony the impotent, Harmony\nthe meaningless. He set his jaw and turned away from the windows, leading\nSteris along a path in the indoor garden, which was set with small rocks and\nplants. From his maps, he guessed that Kelesina would be up on the second\nfloor somewhere. As they followed the path northward, walking along the\nstream, he spotted a second-floor balcony.\n“Honestly,” Steris muttered, “how can they even know if the water is\nsanitary? A river running through their gardens wasn’t enough? It has to go\nthrough the house itself?”\nWax smiled, studying that balcony. “I’m going to scout ahead up there.\nSpeak loudly if someone confronts you. That will warn me, and I’ll sneak\nback.”\n“Very well,” Steris said.\nHe dug in his pocket for a few coins, feeling old-fashioned as he burned\nsteel and prepared to jump.\n“Do you want something more substantial?” Steris asked.\nHe glanced at her, then down at her purse. “They searched your purse.”\n“That they did,” she said, then took the hem of her skirt, lifting it up to the\nside and revealing a small handgun strapped to her thigh. “I worried they’d\ndo something like that. So I made other plans.”\nWax grinned. “I could get used to having you around, Steris.”\nShe blushed in the dim light. “I might, uh, need your help getting the thing\noff.”\nHe knelt down, realizing that she’d used approximately seven rolls of tape"

Also, being Steris, she’d worn shorts under the\ndress—in case she had to do what she was doing. Two pairs, judging by the\nbit of cloth he saw peeking out from under the top one.\nWax set to work extricating the gun. “I see you didn’t want this coming\noff accidentally.”\n“I kept imagining it falling out and firing,” Steris said, “mid-dance.”\nWax grunted, working at her thigh beneath her dress. “You realize that if\nthis were a play, this is exactly the point where someone would walk in on\nus.”\n“Lord Waxillium!” Steris said. “What kind of theater have you been\nattending?”\n“The kind you find in the Roughs,” Wax said, yanking the gun free. It\nproved to be one of his Riotings, a .22 six-shot he kept in his gun case but\nrarely used. It would do. He stood up, letting Steris settle her skirt back\ndown. “Nice work.”\n“I tried a shotgun first,” she said, blushing. “You should have seen me try\nto walk with one of those on my leg!”\n“Stay out of sight, if you can,” he told her, then dropped a coin and\nlaunched himself toward the upper balcony.\n* * *\nMarasi stepped into the gravekeeper’s shack, clicking the door closed behind\nher. Wayne looked up from breaking the legs off a chair.\n“Is that necessary?” Marasi asked.\n“Dunno,” he said, snapping off another one. “It’s fun, though. How are\nour toughs?”\nMarasi glanced out the window toward where a group of the local\nconstables were carting away the last of the thugs. It turned out that setting\noff dynamite in the middle of the city was a fine way to get the attention of\nthe authorities.\n“They don’t know anything,” she said. “Hired muscle, paid and sent to do\nthe hit. The ones who hired them mentioned your name, which turns out to\nhave been a mistake.”\n“I’m famous,” Wayne said happily, snapping another leg off. The hut had\nbeen thoroughly ransacked, drawers ripped out, cushions slit, furniture in\nshambles. Wayne looked at the chair leg he’d broken, apparently checking to\nsee if it was hollow, then tossed it over his shoulder.\n“We can try to follow the payments to those men,” Marasi continued, “but\nI suspect that Suit was too careful for this to be traced. And there’s no sign of\nthe runner boy.”\nWayne grunted, stomping on the floor in one section, then taking a few\nsteps and stomping again.\n“The police brought an Allomancer,” Marasi continued. “And there’s no\nmetal in that grave, so if the spike was ever there, it isn’t now.” She sighed,\nleaning back against the wall. “Rust and Ruin … I hope Waxillium is having\nmore luck than we are.”\nWayne kicked a hole in the floor with the heel of his boot. Marasi perked\nup, then walked over as he fished around in a compartment he’d found.\n“Aha!” he exclaimed."

Too many other\nworkers around to swipe the stuff.”\n“So we’re at a dead end.”\n“Well, there’s an account book on the desk there that I found under a false\nbottom in the drawer,” Wayne noted, taking a swig of the dark liquid he’d\nfound. “Lists everybody what paid the people here for a grave robbin’ in the\nlast few years.”\nMarasi started. “When did you find that?”\n“First,” Wayne said. “Hardly had to search for it. The booze though, that\nthey hid well. Good priorities, these folks.”\nMarasi stepped over some stuffing from one of the sofas and picked up the\nledger. It didn’t belong to Dechamp, but to the graveyard as a whole. It listed\nplots, what had been found in them, and to whom it had been sold.\nIt’s so the boss of the place can keep track of what they’ve sold and what\nthey haven’t, Marasi thought. And to keep track of his minions, to be certain\nthey didn’t get any ideas about making their own side business of grave\nrobbing.\nNext to an entry from a few days back was a note from the manager. If\nanyone comes looking to investigate this plot, send to me immediately.\nMarasi closed the book, then fished from her pocket the paper that listed\nworkers at the graveyard. “Come on,” she said to Wayne. “We have one\nmore stop to make tonight.”\n15\nTempleton Fig smoothed the feathers of his dead white crow. He knew for a\nfact that this animal was an authentic albino, not some knockoff crafted by\nan opportunist who had heard of his collection. By now, he had seen enough\ndead animals bleached white to spot a fake.\nHe had stuffed this bird himself, prize of his collection, and set it looking\nover its shoulder with a small strip of rabbit skin in its beak. Such a\nmagnificent creature. People always found it striking, as its coloring was the\nopposite of what they expected. Things like cats and dogs sometimes had\nwhite coloring naturally, and so his albino specimens of those weren’t as\nspectacular.\nHe replaced the glass dome over the crow, then stepped back and clasped\nhis hands, looking at the white animals in a row. Frozen in death. Perfection.\nOnly … the suckling boar. Had it been moved to the side? The housekeeper\nhad better not have decided to dust his collection again.\nHe stepped up, twisting the glass jar that held the boar. Behind him, fire\ncrackled in his hearth, though it wasn’t particularly cold outside. He even\nhad the window open. He liked the contrast—warmth from the fire, a cool\nbreeze from outside. As he was trying to get the boar just right, the door to\nhis study creaked.\n“Templeton?” a quiet voice asked, peeking in. Destra had bags under her"

Destra had bags under her\neyes, hair frazzled. Her nightgown seemed to have swallowed her. The\nwoman had lost more weight. Soon she would be positively skeletal. “Are\nyou coming to bed?”\n“Later,” he said, looking back to his boar. There.\n“When later?”\n“Later.”\nShe winced at his tone and pulled the door closed behind her. The woman\nshould know better than to disturb him. Sleep. How could he sleep until he\nknew what had happened at the graveyard? One did not disappoint the men\nwith whom he had been dealing. They asked for something to be done, and\nyou saw it done.\nHe would know soon. He stepped forward, moving his albino squirrel to\nthe end of the line. Did it look better that way? He reached up and wiped the\nsweat from his brow, then moved the squirrel back. No, that wasn’t right\neither. Then how was he to—\nHis fire stopped crackling.\nTempleton’s breath caught. He turned slowly in place, fishing in his vest\npocket for his handkerchief. The fire was still there, but it was motionless.\nTrell’s soul! What could have frozen the flames?\nSomething thumped on his door. Templeton backed away, fingers clawing\nat his pocket, still seeking that handkerchief. The door thumped again, and\nhis back hit the shelf where he kept his collection. He tried to whisper an\ninquiry, but he was having trouble breathing.\nThe door burst open and the gravedigger Dechamp—eyes staring\nsightlessly, blood covering his shirt—fell into the room.\nTempleton screamed then, scuttling away from the door, and put his back\nto the far wall of his small den. His fingers found the windowsill, gripping it\nfor strength as he stared at the corpse lying in the doorway.\nSomething tapped on his window.\nTempleton squeezed his eyes shut, not wanting to look. Frozen fire. A\nbody on his floor. He was dreaming. It was a nightmare. It wasn’t\npossible.…\nTap. Tap. Tap.\nHe found his handkerchief finally and clutched it, his eyes squeezed shut.\n“Templeton.” The rasping voice drifted in through the window.\nTempleton turned slowly and faced the window. He opened his eyes.\nDeath stood outside.\nCloaked in black, Death’s face was hidden beneath the hood—but two\nmetal spikes protruded from the cowl, catching the firelight on their heads.\n“I’m dead,” Templeton whispered.\n“No,” Death whispered. “You can die when I say. Not before.”\n“Oh, Harmony.”\n“You are not His,” Death whispered, standing in the darkness outside.\n“You are mine.”\n“What do you want from me? Please!” Templeton slumped to his knees.\nHe forced himself to glance back toward Dechamp. Would that body rise?\nWould it come for him?\n“You have something of mine, Templeton,” Death whispered. “A spike.”\nHe raised his arms, letting the cloak shift back and expose white skin. A\nspike was stuck through one arm. The other arm was bare, save for a bloody\nhole."

I don’t know more. Oh,\nplease. Please! They demanded I recover the spike for them. I didn’t know it\nwas yours! It was just a rusting piece of metal. I’m innocent! I’m…”\nHe trailed off, realizing that the fire had started crackling again. He\nblinked, focusing again on the window. It was empty. A … a dream after all?\nHe turned and found Dechamp’s corpse still leaking blood on the floor.\nTempleton whimpered and huddled down. He was honestly relieved when\nthe constables burst into the room a short time later.\n* * *\nWayne shucked the awful, heavy cloak and held up his arm, healing his\nwounds. Not much left in his metalmind. He was going to have to be sparing\nafter this. Those bullet wounds earlier had taken a lot out of him.\n“You didn’t need to actually cut holes in your arm, Wayne,” Marasi said,\njoining him in the garden—he’d trampled some very nice petunias to get to\nthe window.\n“Course I did,” Wayne replied, wiping away the blood. “You’ve gotta be\nauthentic.” He scratched at his head, and shifted the wires that held two half\nspikes hovering in front of his eyes.\n“Take that thing off,” Marasi said. “It looks ridiculous.”\n“He didn’t think so,” Wayne said. Inside the house, the constables dragged\nTempleton Fig away. The information in the ledger Wayne had found should\nbe enough to see him well and truly incarcerated. Poor chap. He didn’t really\ndo anything wrong. You can’t steal from a person that’s already dead. But\nthen, people were strange about their stuff. Wayne had given up on trying to\nfigure out all their little rules.\nHe’d send the fellow some fruit in prison. Might make him feel better.\n“How was the accent?” he asked.\n“Worked well enough.”\n“I wasn’t sure how Death ’imself would sound, you know? I figured all\nimportant-like, like Wax when he’s tellin’ me to take my feet off the\nfurniture. Mixed with some real old-soundin’ tones, like a grandfather’s\ngrandfather. And grindy, like a man what is choking to death.”\n“In fact,” Marasi said, “he’s quite articulate, and not at all ‘grindy.’ And\nthe accent is strange—not like anything I’ve heard before.”\nWayne grunted, taking off his head spikes. “Can you do it for me?”\n“What? The accent?”\nWayne nodded eagerly.\n“No. Not a chance.”\n“Well, next time you meet that guy, tell ’im he’s gotta come talk to me. I\nneed to hear what he sounds like.”\n“What does it matter?”\n“I gotta hear,” Wayne said. “For next time.”\n“Next time?

So you never can tell.” He\ntook the last swig of Dechamp’s brandy, then slung his cloak over his\nshoulder and started through the mists back toward the road.\n“Dulsing,” Marasi said.\n“You know it?”\n“It’s a little farming settlement,” Marasi said. “Maybe fifty miles northeast\nof New Seran. I read about it in my textbooks—there was a landmark water\nrights case there—but it’s isolated and tiny, barely worth anyone’s time.\nWhat in the world does the Set want with it?”\n“Maybe they like their tomatoes real fresh,” Wayne said. “I know I do.”\nMarasi grew silent, obviously deep in thought, worried for some reason.\nWayne left her to it, digging out his tin of gum, tapping it, then flipping it\nopen and selecting one of the soft, powder-covered balls to chew. So far as\nhe was concerned, this had been a bang-up night. Dynamite, a nice brawl,\nfree brandy, and getting to scare the piss out of someone.\nIt was the simple things that made his life worth living.\n* * *\nWax had little luck with the first set of rooms he scouted. Though they\nsupposedly belonged to Kelesina, they proved to be empty. He was tempted\nto ransack them for information, but decided that would take too long—and\nwould be too incriminating at the moment. Being discovered lost in a\nhallway was excusable; being discovered going through a lady’s desk\ndrawers was another thing entirely.\nHe prowled back to the atrium and checked on Steris, gave her a wave,\nthen continued down another hallway. This one bordered the outer wall and\nhad windows open to the mists, which streamed in with their own miniature\nwaterfalls. Likely some servant had the duty to close those windows on a\nmisty night, but had gotten distracted by the party.\nHe listened at a set of doors, and heard nothing other than a voice drifting\nin from the window—the voice of Lord Severington, still plowing through\nhis speech in the ballroom. With the amplification devices, Wax could make\nout a word here and there.\n“… suffer the rule … new Lord Ruler?… improper taxation … era must\nend…”\nI will have to give that more attention, Wax thought, prowling through the\nhallway toward the next set of rooms. Severington was mayor of Bilming,\nthe port city west of Elendel. It was the only major one in the Basin besides\nElendel itself—and was an industrial powerhouse. If conflict did come,\nthey’d be spearheading it.\nThey’re spearheading it now, Wax realized as more words drifted up to\nhim.\nHe continued down the hallway, listening at the next set of doors. He was\nabout to turn away, when he heard a voice. There was someone inside. Wax\ncrouched down, ear to the door, wishing he had a Tineye along to listen for\nhim. That voice …\nThat was his uncle.\nWax pressed his ear up against the door, heedless of how he’d look to\nsomeone entering the hallway. Rusts … he couldn’t make out much. A half"

A half\nword here and there. But it was Edwarn. Another voice spoke, and that was\nalmost certainly Kelesina.\nThe gap under the door was dark. Wax put his hand to his pocket and the\nhandgun secreted there, then turned the door’s knob and eased it open.\nBeyond was some kind of study, completely dark but for the thin strip of\nlight under the door on the far side. Wax slipped inside, closed the door\nbehind him, and scuttled through the room—stifling a curse as he smacked\nhis arm on an end table. Heart thumping, he put his back to the wall beside\nthe other door.\n“Never mind that,” his uncle was saying. His voice was muffled, as if he\nwere speaking through a cloth or a mask or something. “Why have you\ninterrupted me? You know the importance of my work.”\n“Waxillium knows about the project,” Kelesina said. “And he’s found one\nof the coins. He’s acting stupid, but he knows.”\n“The diversions?”\n“He’s not biting.”\n“You’re not trying hard enough then,” Suit said. “Kidnap one of his\nfriends and leave a letter, purportedly from one of his old enemies.\nChallenge his wits, draw him into an investigation. Waxillium cannot resist a\npersonal grudge. It will work.”\n“The train robbery didn’t,” Kelesina said. “What of that, Suit? We wasted\nvital resources, important connections I had spent years cultivating, on that\nattack. You promised that if we attacked while he was on board, he wouldn’t\nbe able to resist investigating. Yet he ignored it. Left Ironstand that same\nnight.”\nWax felt a chill as a whole set of assumptions shifted within him. The\ntrain robbery … had it been a distraction, intended to draw his attention\naway from pursuing the Set?\n“Recovering the device,” Suit said, “was worth the risk.”\n“You mean the device Irich immediately lost?” Kelesina demanded. “That\none shouldn’t be trusted with important missions. He’s too eager. You should\nhave let me recover the item once Waxillium was off the train.”\n“There was a good chance he’d take the bait,” Edwarn said. “I know my\nnephew; he’s probably still itching to go after those bandits. If he’s at your\nparty instead, then you aren’t doing your duty properly. I haven’t time to\nhold your hand on this, Kelesina. I need to be off to the second site.”\nWax frowned. The train hadn’t been just a distraction, it seemed. But the\nwords left him with a deeper sense of worry. He’d chased half a dozen leads\nduring the last year, anticipating that he was close on the heels of his uncle.\nHow many of those had been plants? And how many of his other cases had\nbeen intentional distractions? And Ape Manton? Was he really even in New\nSeran? Likely not.\nEdwarn spoke a truth. He knew Wax well. Too well, for a man he’d barely\nseen in the last twenty years."

Too well, for a man he’d barely\nseen in the last twenty years.\n“Well,” Suit said, “you have your chance now to recover the device, as\nyou promised you could. How is that going?”\n“It wasn’t in the things he checked at the party,” Kelesina said. “We snuck\na spy among the hotel staff, and she will search for it in his rooms. I’m\ntelling you, Irich—”\n“Irich was punished,” Suit said. Why did his voice sound so much smaller\nthan Kelesina’s? “That is all you need know. Recover it for me, and other\nmistakes might be forgiven. It is only a matter of time before they\naccidentally use Allomancy near it.”\n“And then will we see this ‘miracle’ you keep promising, Suit?” she\ndemanded. “A few more speeches like this one, and Severington will have\nthe entirety of the Basin whipped into a frenzy. Completely ignoring that\nElendel has us outmanned and outgunned.”\n“Patience!” Suit said, sounding amused.\n“You try to be patient. They’re bleeding us dry. You promised to crush that\ncity, provide an army, and—”\n“Patience,” Suit repeated softly. “Stop Waxillium. That is your part of the\nbargain now. Keep him in the city; keep him distracted.”\n“That’s not going to work, Suit,” Kelesina said. “He knows too much\nalready. That damn shapeshifter must have told him—”\n“You let it escape?”\nKelesina was silent.\n“I thought,” Suit said, voice growing cold, “that you had disposed of the\ncreature. You presented its spike to me, claiming the other had been\ndestroyed.”\n“We … may have assumed too quickly.”\n“I see,” Suit said.\nThe two did not speak for a protracted moment. Wax raised his gun beside\nhis head, sweat trickling down his brow in the dark room. He toyed with\nbreaking in right then. He had evidence on Kelesina in the form of the\nwounded kandra and his own testimony. Several people died in that blast.\nMurder.\nBut did he have enough against Edwarn? Would his uncle just slip away\nagain? Rusts, an army? They spoke of destroying Elendel. Dared he wait?

She crossed the room in a rush, and\nblessedly didn’t turn on the room’s lights—instead walking straight to the\ndoorway that Wax had been listening at.\nShe didn’t look up and see Wax pressed to the ceiling above her, Pushing\nagainst a coin she walked right over in her haste to knock on the door.\nKelesina called for her to enter.\n“My lady,” the steward said in an urgent tone. “Burl sent me word while\nwatching the party for Allomancers.

Kelesina rose from her seat, eyes wide. And\nUncle Edwarn …\nUncle Edwarn wasn’t in the room. The only thing there was a boxy device\non the table in front of Kelesina.\n16\n“Why, Waxillium!” the box said, projecting his uncle’s voice. “So good to\nhear your dulcet tones. I presume your entrance was properly dramatic?”\n“It’s a telegraph for voices,” Wax said, stepping forward. He kept his gun\non Kelesina, who backed up to the wall of the small room. She’d gone\ncompletely pale.\n“Something like that,” Edwarn said, his voice sounding small. The electric\nmechanism didn’t reproduce it exactly. “How is Lady Harms? I hope her\nailment was nothing too distressing.”\n“She’s fine,” Wax snapped, “no thanks to the fact that you tried to have us\nall killed on that train.”\n“Now, now,” Edwarn said. “That wasn’t the point. Why, killing you was\nan afterthought. Tell me, did you look into the casualties on the train? One\npassenger killed, I believe. Who was he?”\n“You’re trying to distract me,” Wax said.\n“Yes, I am. But that doesn’t mean I’m lying. In fact, I’ve found that telling\nyou the truth is a far better method in general. You should look into the dead\nman. You’ll be impressed by what you find.”\nNo. Stay focused. “Where are you?” Wax demanded.\n“Away,” Suit said, “on matters of great import. I do apologize for not\nbeing able to meet you in person. I offer up Lady Kelesina as a measure of\nmy condolences.”\n“Kelesina can go to hell,” Wax said, grabbing the box and lifting it, nearly\nyanking the wires in the back from the wall. “Where is my sister!”\n“So many impatient people in the world,” Edwarn’s voice said. “You\nreally should have focused on your own city, Nephew, and kept your\nattention on the little crimes fed to you. I’ve tried being reasonable. I fear\nI’m going to have to do something drastic. Something that will be certain to\ndivert you.”\nWax felt cold. “What are you going to do, Suit?”\n“It’s not about what I’m going to do, Nephew. It’s about what I’m doing.”\nWax glanced toward Kelesina, who had been reaching for the pocket of\nher dress. She raised her hands, frightened, right as something enormous\nsmashed into Wax.

Kelesina fell limp to the floor, blood\ndribbling from the hole in her forehead.\n“He killed her!” a voice screamed from the doorway outside. Wax spun to\nfind the maid he’d seen earlier standing there, hands to her face. “Lord\nLadrian killed our lady!” The woman ran away screaming the words over\nand over, although she’d obviously had a clear view of the room.\n“You bastard!” Wax shouted toward the box.\n“Now, now,” the box said. “That’s patently false, Waxillium. You have a\nvery clear understanding of my parentage.”\nThe steward walked over to Kelesina, fishing at something on Kelesina’s\nbody. Then, for some reason, the steward shot the dead woman again.\nEither way, this gave Wax a chance to seize the box, which had fallen\nfrom the table near him.\n“You’d better be careful, Nephew,” the box said. “I’ve told them to kill\nyou if they can. In this case, a dead scapegoat will work as well as a living\none.”\nWax roared, ripping the box free of the wall and Pushing it out the\ndoorway, into the next room.

Wax turned and scrambled from the smaller room\ninto the one beyond, where he’d first hidden from the steward. He kicked the\ndoor shut to give himself some cover, then Pushed on his coin from before\nand leaped over a couch, soaring through the room. He scooped up the box\ncommunication device and skidded out into the hallway.\nHalf a dozen men in black coats and white gloves were advancing down\nthe hallway toward him.

Blue lines pointed all around him\nand he looked for one out of place … there! He Pushed on it, opening a\nhidden door in the wall which led into a small passage, lit with dangling\nlightbulbs, that servants used. Still carting the telegraph box, he leaped\nthrough it as men piled into the sitting room behind him.\nThe weaving maze of passages let him keep ahead of them, though he did\nhave to spend a coin taking one of them out as they got too close.

He charged toward the central atrium, but as soon as he\nreached the balcony’s stairway down, something leaped from the shadows\nand blindsided him.\nThe Terriswoman, face bleeding from where the slammed door had\nbroken her nose, growled and grabbed him around the neck. He Pushed a\ncoin up at her, but it didn’t have time to gain momentum. It hit her in the\nchest, then stayed there as he Pushed on it, trying to push her off. He\nstrained, his vision growing dark, until a fist punched the Terriswoman\nacross the face.\nShe let go, stumbling back and shaking. Wax gasped for breath, looking\nup at MeLaan looming over him.\n“Rusts!” she said with a deep bass voice. “You did start without me.”\nThe Terriswoman came charging in again, and Wax rolled to the side,\nfishing for coins. He brought up his last three in a handful as the steward\npunched MeLaan across the face. Something cracked audibly, and Wax\nhesitated as the steward stumbled back, clutching her mangled hand, the\nknuckles apparently shattered, the thumb ripped almost free.\nMeLaan grinned. Her face had split where she’d been struck, revealing a\ngleaming metal skull underneath. “You really should be careful what you\npunch.”\nThe Terriswoman lurched to her feet, and MeLaan casually grabbed her\nown left forearm in her right hand and ripped it off, revealing a long, thin\nmetal blade attached to the arm at the stump. As the Terriswoman came for\nher, MeLaan thrust the weapon through the woman’s chest. The steward\ngasped and collapsed to her knees, then deflated like a punctured wineskin.\n“Harmony, I love this body,” MeLaan said, glancing toward Wax with a\ngoofy grin on her face. “How did I ever consider wearing another?”\n“Is that whole thing aluminum?” Wax asked.\n“Yup!”\n“It must be worth a fortune,” Wax said, standing and putting his back to\nthe wall.

The kill squad would be following soon.\n“Conveniently, I’ve had a few hundred years to save up,” MeLaan said.\n“It—”\nWax pulled her to cover beside the wall with him; she was actually lighter\nthan he had anticipated, considering that she had metal bones.\n“What?” she asked softly.\nWax raised a coin, listening for footfalls.

A metal bracelet of pure gold.\nThe Terriswoman took this off Kelesina, Wax thought, turning it over in\nhis fingers as he remembered the moment earlier, when the murderer had\nknelt beside Kelesina’s body.\nHe burned steel, and his hunch proved correct. While he could sense the\nbracelet, the line was much thinner than it should have been. This was a\nmetalmind, and one heavily Invested with healing power.\n“Was Kelesina Terris?”\n“How should I know?” MeLaan asked.\nHe pocketed the bracelet and grabbed the box telegraph device—which he\nwanted to send to Elendel for inspection—and tossed it to MeLaan. “Bring\nthat, if you don’t mind, and meet us at the hotel. Be ready to leave the city. I\ndoubt we’re staying the night.”\n“And you were so certain we’d be out of here without a fight.”\n“I never said that. I said it wouldn’t get so bad that I needed Wayne. And it\ndidn’t.”\n“A semantic technicality.”\n“I’m a nobleman. Might as well learn something from my peers.” He\nsaluted her with the small gun, then dropped off the balcony and used a coin\nto slow himself. “Steris?”\nShe crawled from a nearby shrub. “How did it go?”\n“Poorly,” Wax said, looking up toward the ceiling, then removing his\ndinner jacket. “I may have accidentally let them implicate us in Lady\nKelesina’s murder.”\n“Bother,” Steris said.\n“Their evidence will depend on whether they can trace the bullets back to\nme,” Wax said, “and whether they recover any of my prints from the area.\nEither way, they’ll be producing fake witnesses to try to make it look like I"

Grab on.”\nSteris grabbed him with, he noted, no small amount of eagerness. She\nreally did enjoy this part. He took the bullets from his .22 and held them in\none hand, then launched off the coin below to shoot them toward the ceiling.\nHe flung the bullets toward the skylights and Pushed them in a spray to\nweaken a window, then raised his arm—wrapped in his jacket—over his\nhead and crashed them through the glass and out into the swirling mists.\nThey landed on the roof as Wax got his bearings. Out in the mists, he felt\nbetter almost immediately, and his hand—which had been smarting where\nthe Terriswoman smacked his gun away—stopped throbbing.\n“Did you learn anything useful?” Steris asked.\n“Not sure,” Wax said. “Most of what I overheard was about a rebellion\nagainst Elendel. I know Edwarn is heading somewhere important. He called\nit the second site? And he said something about what I think is that little\ncube Marasi found.”\nHe pulled her tight again, then sent them in a Push upward through the\nmists in the direction of their hotel. She held to him tightly, but watched the\nlights of the city beneath with awe.\n“He had Kelesina murdered,” Wax said. “I should have seen it. Should\nhave anticipated.”\n“At least,” Steris said over the sound of the passing wind, “the mists are\nout. They’ll have trouble tracking us.”\n“You did well tonight, Steris. Very well. Thank you.”\n“It was engaging,” she said as he dropped them onto a rooftop. Her smile,\nwhich she let out readily, warmed him. She was proof that, despite his\ndislike of the politics in the Basin, it had good people. Genuine people.\nStrikingly, he had been forced to realize something almost exactly like that\nabout the Roughs after first moving there.\nShe was gorgeous. Like an uncut emerald sitting in the middle of a pile of\nfakes cut to sparkle, but really just glass. Her enthusiasm balanced,\nsomewhat, his concern over what had happened. Missing Suit. Being\nimplicated. Lessie would say …\nNo. He didn’t need to think of Lessie right now. He smiled back at Steris,\nthen pulled her tighter and Pushed, launching them straight up. Higher, up\naway from this district. The city’s taller buildings were visible only as lines\nof lights in the night, pointing upward through the mists. He launched up off\na rooftop, then passed a shaking gondola, moving by electricity and carrying\na group of gawking passengers. It rocked as Wax launched them sideways\nfrom it toward the skyscrapers.\nTwo were near enough one another, and with a quick series of furious\nPushes, he was able to throw himself and Steris up through the swirling\nmists in a succession of arcs, first one way, then the other. He crested the\ntops and Pushed off one, sending them up a little farther. He had hoped that\nwith the elevation of this highest terrace of the city—\nYes.

They burst from the mists into a realm seen by very few. The\nAscendant’s Field, Coinshots called it: the top of the mists at night. White\nstretched in all directions, churning like an ocean’s surface, bathed in\nstarlight.\nSteris gasped, and Wax managed to hold them in place by Pushing against\nthe tips of the two skyscrapers below. Without a third, he wasn’t certain how\nlong he could balance, but for the moment they remained steady.\n“So beautiful…” Steris said, clinging to him.\n“Thank you again,” Wax said to her. “I still can’t believe you snuck a gun\ninto the party.”\n“It’s only appropriate,” Steris said, “that you would make a smuggler out\nof me.”\n“Just as you try to make a gentleman out of me.”\n“You’re already a gentleman,” Steris said.\nWax looked down at her as she held to him while trying to stare in every\ndirection at once. He suddenly found something burning in him, like a metal.\nA protectiveness for this woman in his arms, so full of logic and yet so full\nof wonder at the same time. And a powerful affection.\nSo he let himself kiss her. She was surprised by it, but melted into the\nembrace. They started to drift sideways and arc downward as he lost his\nbalance on his anchors, but he held on to the kiss, letting them slip back\ndown into the churning mists.\n* * *\nWayne put his feet up on the table in their hotel suite, a new book open in\nfront of him. He’d picked it up earlier, when poking through the city.\n“You oughtta read this thing, Mara,” he called to Marasi, who paced back\nand forth behind his couch. “Strangest thing you ever heard. These blokes,\nthey build this ship, right? Only it’s meant to go up. Uses a big explosion or\nsome such to send it to the stars. These other blokes steal it, right, and there’s\nseven of them, all convicts. They go lookin’ for plunder, but end up on this\nstar what has no—”\n“How can you read?” Marasi asked, still pacing.\n“Well, I’m not right sure,” Wayne said. “By all accounts, I should be\ndumber than a sack full o’ noodles.”\n“I mean, aren’t you nervous?” Marasi asked.\n“Why should I be?”\n“Something could go wrong.”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “I’m not along. Wax can only get into so much\ntrouble without me to—”\nSomething hit the window, causing Marasi to jump. Wayne turned to see\nWax clinging to one of the windowsills, Steris tucked under one arm like a\nsack of potatoes—well, a sack of potatoes that had a very nice rack, anyway.\nWax pulled open the window, set Steris inside, then swung in himself.\nWayne popped a peanut into his mouth. “How’d it go?”\n“Eh,” Wax said. He had lost his dinner jacket somewhere, and blood—\nhopefully not his own—covered one arm of his shirt. His cravat drooped,\nhalf tied."

Suit’s timetable\nseems to be more advanced than I’d thought.”\n“Cheery,” Wayne said. “So…”\nWax sighed, then pulled out his billfold and tossed a note at Wayne. “You\nwin.”\n“You had a bet?” Marasi demanded.\n“Friendly wager,” Wayne said, making the note disappear. “Can I bring\nthese peanuts when we go?”\n“Go?” Marasi said, standing up.\nWayne thumbed toward Wax, who had pulled out his travel bag. “We’re\nleaving. Marasi, Steris, I’d suggest packing lightly. You have about fifteen\nminutes.”\n“I’m already packed,” Steris said, standing up.\n“I—” Marasi looked from him to her, seeming baffled. “What did you do\nat that party?”\n“Hopefully,” Wax said, “not start a war. But I can’t say for certain.”\nMarasi groaned. “You let him do this,” she accused Steris.\nSteris blushed. Wayne always found that expression odd from her, seeing\nas how she had the emotions of a rock and all.\nWhat followed was an energetic bout of motion as Wax and Marasi both\nran to pack things. Wayne sidled up to Steris and popped a peanut in his\nmouth. “You got that preparin’-your-bags-early thing from me, didn’t you?”\n“I … Well, yes, actually.”\n“What will you trade me for it, then?” Wayne said. “Gotta have a good\ntrade when you take stuff.”\n“I’ll think about it,” Steris said.\nFifteen minutes later, the four of them piled into a carriage driven by\nMeLaan in her male body.

He’d left it as a tip on account\nof him putting his boots up on the furniture.\nA furiously loud set of bells sounded in the distance, and it drew closer.\n“Is that the constables?” Aunt Gin asked, sounding horrified.\n“Afraid so,” Wax said, pulling the door closed.\nThe carriage lurched into motion, and Steris leaned out the window,\nwaving farewell to the poor innkeeper.\n“Framed for murder!” Steris called to her. “It’s on page seventeen of the\nlist I gave you!

        "text": "* * *\nA few hours later, Wax stepped up to a cliff in the darkness and let the mists\nenfold him.\nHe missed darkness. It was never dark in the city, not as it had been in the\nRoughs. Electric lights were only exacerbating the issue. Everything\nglowing, casting away the darkness—and with it, stillness. Silence. Solitude.\nA man found himself when he was alone. You only had one person to chat\nwith, one person to blame. He fished in his mistcoat pocket and was\nsurprised to find a cigar. He thought he was out of these, good stout\nTingmars brought down from Weathering.\nHe cut this one with his belt knife, then lit it with a match. He savored it,\ndrawing in the smoke, holding it, then puffing it out to churn in the mists. A\nlittle bit of him to mix with Harmony. May He choke on it.\nAt his side, he turned a little metal spike over in his fingers. The earring\nVenDell had sent.\nIt was nearly identical to the one he’d used to kill Lessie.\nEventually, footsteps on pine needles signaled someone approaching. He\npulled on his cigar, giving a warm glow to the mists and revealing MeLaan’s\nface. Her feminine one. She’d finished changing, and was doing up the\nbuttons on her shirt as she joined him.\n“You going to get some sleep?” she asked softly.\n“Maybe.”\n“Last I checked,” she said, “humans still need it. Once in a while.”\nWax pulled on his cigar, then blew out into the mists again.\n“Suit wants you to go back to Elendel, I figure,” MeLaan said. “He’s\ntrying to set it up so that you’ll have no choice, so far as you see it.”\n“We’re in a bad spot, MeLaan,” Wax said. “The emissary that Aradel\nsends to a political rally ends up murdering the host? If the outer cities\nweren’t tense before, they will be now. At the very best, it will be a huge\npolitical embarrassment. At the worst, I’ve started a war.”\nWind blew, rustling pine branches he couldn’t see. He couldn’t even see\nMeLaan; clouds must have rolled in, blocking the starlight. Sweet,\nenveloping darkness.\n“If there is war,” she said, “Suit will have started it. Not you.”\n“I might be able to prevent it,” Wax said. “Governor Aradel needs to\nknow, MeLaan. If the outer cities are going to claim assassination—use it as\nthe brand to start a bonfire—I can’t just vanish. I have to get to Elendel. That\nway, I can claim I knew the New Seran justice system was corrupt, and so I\nfled to safety. I can make my case in the broadsheets before news spreads; I\ncan convince Aradel I didn’t kill the woman. If I do anything else, it will\nlook like I’m hiding.”\n“Like I said,” MeLaan said. “He’s set it up so that you have no choice—so\nfar as you see it.”\n“You see it differently?”\n“I’ve been a lot of people, Ladrian. Seen through a lot of eyes. There’s\nalways another perspective, if you look hard enough.”"

        "text": "far as you see it.”\n“You see it differently?”\n“I’ve been a lot of people, Ladrian. Seen through a lot of eyes. There’s\nalways another perspective, if you look hard enough.”\nHe pulled on his cigar and held the smoke a long moment before letting it\nout in a slow dribble. MeLaan crept away. Did her kind need sleep? She’d\nimplied they didn’t, but he couldn’t say for certain.\nAlone with his cigar, he tried to sort through what he wanted to do. Go\nback to Elendel, as forced upon him by Suit’s minions, or chase after the\nmystery—as forced upon him by Harmony’s minions. He rolled the earring\nin his fingers, and confronted the hatred simmering inside of him.\nHe’d never hated God before. After Lessie’s supposed death the first time,\nhe hadn’t blamed Harmony. Rusts, even after Bleeder had raised the question\nof why Harmony hadn’t helped, Wax hadn’t responded with hatred.\nBut now … yes, that hatred was there. You could take knocks, out in the\nRoughs. You lost friends. You sometimes had to kill a man you didn’t want\nto kill. But one thing you never did: You never betrayed a companion.\nFriends were too rare a privilege out in those wilds, where everything\nseemed to want you dead.\nBy hiding the truth from him, Harmony had stabbed him square in the\nback. Wax could forgive a lot of things. He wasn’t sure this was one of them.\nHis cigar eventually ran out. His questions lingered. By the time he hiked\nback toward their campsite, the mist was retreating for the night. He fed the\nhorses—six of them, purchased at the New Seran bottom terrace shipping\nyards, along with a full-sized stagecoach used to do runs to the Southern\nRoughs.\nThey’d narrowly escaped New Seran. Galloping their carriage, they’d\nmanaged to descend the ramps before the police, but only after Wax had\nbeen forced to bring down a gondola line.\nThe police hadn’t given chase after that, as if realizing they didn’t have\nthe resources to hunt someone like Waxillium Dawnshot, at least not without\na lot of backup. Wax still wanted to be moving. Though he was tired to the\nbones, he couldn’t let himself—or anyone else—rest long. Just in case.\nAs the others groggily piled into the vehicle, MeLaan took the reins from\nhim and climbed up to the driver’s seat. Wayne hopped into the spotter’s seat\nbeside her, and she gave him a grin.\n“Where to, boss?” she asked, turning to Wax. “Back home?”\n“No,” Wax said. “We ride to Dulsing, the place Wayne and Marasi\nlocated.” The direction of the building project.\n“You found another perspective, I see,” MeLaan said.\n“Not yet,” Wax said softly, climbing into the stagecoach. “But let’s see if\nHarmony dares try to give me one.”\nPART THREE\n17\nMarasi had read a lot about life in the Roughs in her youth, and knew what\nto expect of a stagecoach trip: boredom, dust, and discomfort.\nIt was wonderful.\nShe had to forcibly keep herself from hanging out the window as Wayne"

They weren’t in the Roughs, but\nthis was close enough. The smell of the horses, the bumps in the road, the\nrickety creak of the wood and the springs … She had seen and done some\nremarkable things during her time with Waxillium, but this really felt as if\nshe were living in an adventure.\nWaxillium reclined across from her, feet up on the seat next to her, a wide-\nbrimmed hat over his eyes, face bristly from a day without shaving. He’d\nremoved his boots, which sat on the floor beside his shotgun.\nIt seemed surreal to remember she’d even considered a relationship with\nhim, now that so long had passed with them working together. No, she was\nnot interested, no longer. But she did admire the perfect image of him there\n—the gun, the boots, and the hat.\nOf course, that image was distorted by the sight of Steris curled up on the\nseat beside him, snoring softly with her head on his shoulder. In what kind of\nbizarre world did Marasi’s punctilious half sister end up on the adventure?\nSteris belonged in a sitting room with a cup of tea and a dry book about\nhorticulture, not riding cross-country in a stagecoach toward a potential\narmy of Allomancers. Yet here she was, snuggled up against Dawnshot\nhimself.\nMarasi shook her head. She wasn’t envious of Steris, which was—frankly\n—remarkable, considering their upbringings. It was very hard to hate Steris.\nYou could be bored by her, confused by her, or frustrated with her—but hate\nher? Impossible.\nMarasi got out her notebook to continue her report to VenDell and\nConstable-General Reddi, which she hoped to be able to send before\nreaching Dulsing.\nWaxillium shifted, then tipped his hat back, eyeing her. “You should get\nsome sleep.”\n“I’ll rest when we stop.”\n“Stop?”\nMarasi hesitated. They’d been going for half a day already, avoiding the\nmain roads to evade potential pursuers from New Seran. They’d crossed\nseveral fields, and spent a full hour rattling along a stone ridge to bypass\nsome farms below in a way that left little sign of their passage.\nTheir path lay almost directly northeast of New Seran, skirting the\nmountains to their right, staying to the foothills—which meant some ups and\ndowns, but this was still good farmland. All of the Basin was, even here at\nthe edges, where things were dryer than in the center.\n“I thought that after stopping last night—” Marasi said. “Dear. You mean\nto go straight there?”\n“‘Straight’ is an odd term,” Waxillium said, “considering how much\nMeLaan has us weaving to avoid getting caught. But yes. Shouldn’t be more\nthan another four hours or so.”\nA train could have had them there in a fraction of that time, delivered in\ncomfort. Maybe the outer cities did have reason to gripe about the way\nthings were set up.\n“Waxillium?” Marasi said as he shifted again."

The Bands of Mourning?”\nHe tipped back his hat all the way. “Did I ever tell you why I went to the\nRoughs?”\n“As a youth?” Marasi said. “It was because you hated the politics, the\nexpectations. Polite society that was anything but polite.”\n“That’s why I left Elendel,” Waxillium said. “But why the Roughs? I\ncould have gone to one of the outer cities, could have found a plantation\nsomewhere to read books and live a quiet life.”\n“Well…” Marasi frowned. “I guess I thought you always wanted to be a\nlawman.”\nWaxillium smiled. “I wish I’d spotted it that easily. Should have. I spent\nmy childhood tattling on other children for every little thing they did.”\n“Then what?”\nHe settled back, closing his eyes. “I was chasing a legend, Marasi. Tales\nof the Survivor’s gold, riches to be had, stories to be made.”\n“You?” Marasi started. “You were a gentleman adventurer?”\nWaxillium winced visibly at the term. “You make me sound like that fool\nin the broadsheets. I tell you, Marasi, those first months were hard. Every\nother town was full of the unemployed from the mines shutting down, and I\ncouldn’t enter a saloon without finding some fool baby-face like myself, up\nfrom the Basin with a head full of glory and treasure.”\n“So you started hunting bounties,” she said. “You told me this part.\nSomething about boots.”\n“Eventually, yes,” Waxillium said, smiling. “Struggled for a long time up\nthere before turning to bounties. At first, though, I had my eyes full of riches\nand gold. Took time to shake that out of me, but even then, becoming a\nlawman was about the cash. Started hunting men for money. And, well,\nthere’d always been this streak in me that didn’t like seeing people get\npushed around. Ended up in Weathering. Just another forgotten, dried-out\ncity in the Roughs with nobody to care about it. It was six years before\nsomeone gave me credentials and made it official.”\nThe stagecoach cabin swayed on its straps. Up above, Marasi could hear\nWayne and MeLaan chatting. So long as they weren’t making out again\nwhile trying to drive.\n“When VenDell told us about this, I didn’t want the Bands to be real,”\nWaxillium said, looking out the window. “I hated the thought of some\nfoolish dream pulling me away again, after I’d finally found stability in\nElendel. I didn’t want that lure of excitement, the reminder of a world I’d\ncome to love out there in the dust.”\n“So you think they are real.”\n“Here’s the thing,” he said, leaning forward, causing Steris to shift in her\nsleep. “My uncle hasn’t had time to breed his Allomancers, as I suspect he’s\nbeen doing. The plans he and the Set have concocted, they’re long-term\ninvestments. But he promised something to Kelesina, and he really sounded"

You have the device?”\nMarasi pulled the small metal cube from her purse. Waxillium fished in\nhis pocket and brought out his coin, the one some beggar had apparently\ngiven him. He held up the two next to each other, sunlight through the\nwindow gleaming off the cube and highlighting the otherworldly symbols on\nits sides.\n“Something strange is going on, Marasi,” Waxillium said. “Something\nimportant enough to draw my uncle’s attention. I don’t have the answers. I\nneed to find them.”\nShe found herself smiling at the intensity in his eyes. “It’s not the treasure\nhunter that made you decide to go to Dulsing. It’s the detective.”\nHe smiled. “You were listening to what MeLaan said to me last night?”\nMarasi nodded.\n“You were supposed to be asleep,” Waxillium said. He flipped the coin,\ncaught it, then tossed the cube back to her. “Going to Aradel would have\nbeen the mature, prudent move, but I have to find the answers. And who\nknows? Maybe the Bands are real. If so, then getting them away from Suit is\nat least as important as informing the governor of what happened in New\nSeran.”\n“You think your uncle is trying to make Allomancers with technology,\nrather than by birth.”\n“A frightening power in the hands of a man like my uncle,” Waxillium\nsaid, leaning back into his seat. “Get some sleep. We’re probably going to\ninfiltrate this building project in Dulsing during the night.”\nHe settled with his hat over his eyes again. Marasi felt she should do as he\nsaid, and so tried to doze off. Unfortunately, there were too many thoughts in\nher head for sleep.\nAfter some time, she gave up and returned to her letter. In it, she\nexplained what they’d done and discovered. She needed to send this soon.\nPerhaps she could find a telegraph station when they changed horses, and\nsend the letter in time for it to make a difference.\nOnce done with the letter, she moved to her notes about the missing\nkandra spike. Kelesina, acting on behalf of the Set, had tried to kill ReLuur,\nand had assumed success. When Suit had demanded proof, she’d ordered the\nspike dug up and sent to him in Dulsing. But where would it be kept there?\nSomeplace secure, presumably. How in the world was she going to find it?\nShe held up the little cube. Suit had asked after this. Could she use that\nsomehow?\nMarasi frowned, turning the cube. The sides had little grooves between\nthem. She looked closer, and in the sunlight spotted something she hadn’t\nseen before. A tiny little knob hidden in one groove. It looked like … well, a\nswitch. Nestled in, where it couldn’t be flipped accidentally.\nShe used a hairpin to reach in and flip the switch. It moved just as she’d\nexpect it to.\nA switch. It seemed so … mundane. This was either a mystical relic or\nsome kind of secret technology. You didn’t use a switch on things like that;"

You didn’t use a switch on things like that;\nyou held them up to starlight, or spoke the special command phrases, or did\na dance on the last day of the month while eating a kumquat.\nThe switch didn’t seem to have done anything. So, Marasi swallowed and\nburned a pinch of cadmium.\nThe cube began to vibrate in her fingers.\nThen the entire coach lurched, rocking as if it had been struck by\nsomething very hard. Marasi hit her head on the roof, then was slammed\nback down onto her seat.\nThe horses screamed, but MeLaan somehow kept them under control.\nWithin moments, the coach had pulled to a stop.\n“What the hell was that?” Waxillium said, hauling himself up off the floor,\nwhere he had ended up in a jumble with Steris.\nMarasi groaned, sitting up and holding her head. “I did something stupid.”\n“How stupid?” Waxillium asked.\n“I was testing the device,” Marasi said, “and used Allomancy.”\nWayne’s head appeared at the door a moment later, hanging down from\nabove. “Was that a speed bubble?”\n“Yes,” Marasi said.\n“That jolt damn near killed the horses,” Wayne said.\n“I’m sorry, I’m sorry.”\nWaxillium helped Steris sit up. “What … what went wrong?” she asked,\nbefuddled.\n“Marasi used a speed bubble while we were moving,” Waxillium said.\n“We hit the threshold and towed her out of it, popping the thing and lurching\nus from one time frame to the next.”\n“But, she used it on the train,” Steris said.\n“Speed bubbles move with you if you’re on something massive enough,”\nWaxillium said. “Otherwise, the spinning of the planet would pop you out of\nevery one you made. The train was heavy and fast. The stagecoach is small\nand just slow enough. So—”\n“So I should have known better,” Marasi said, blushing. “I haven’t done\nthat since I was a kid. But Waxillium, it buzzed.”\n“What?”\n“The cube, it—” Marasi started, realizing she’d dropped the cube in the\nconfusion. She searched around frantically before finally locating it near his\nfoot. She held it up triumphantly. “It had a switch.”\n“A switch?”\nShe turned it to the side, showing them the little switch. “You have to slip\nsomething small in to move it,” she said. “But it works now.”\nHe looked at it, baffled, then showed it to Steris, who squinted. “What\nkind of eldritch device,” Steris said, “has an on switch?”\n“Makes sense, I guess,” Waxillium said. “You don’t want your eldritch\ndevices turning on accidentally.”\n“Might end up almost killing your stagecoach drivers,” Wayne grumbled.\n“It didn’t stop your Allomancy?” Waxillium asked Marasi, rubbing his\nchin.\nShe shook her head. She could still sense her metal reserves. “It didn’t\nseem to do anything.”\n“Huh.” Waxillium held it up. “Could be dangerous.”"

She could still sense her metal reserves. “It didn’t\nseem to do anything.”\n“Huh.” Waxillium held it up. “Could be dangerous.”\n“So we’re testing it, then?” Wayne asked, hanging into the window.\n“Of course we are,” Waxillium said. “But away from the coach.”\n* * *\nWax held the vibrating cube in his hand. It did respond to his metal burning,\nbut didn’t seem to do anything else.\nThey’d stopped near a stand of towering walnut trees, and Wayne was\nfilling his pockets while Marasi watched Wax experiment from a safe\ndistance. MeLaan watered the horses at a stream down the way. Nearby, a\nfield of carrots grew with green sprouts, completely uncultivated. The air\nsmelled fresh, of life untouched.\nHe held up the buzzing cube and let his metals die off. The cube stopped\nvibrating. He burned them again, and it responded—starting slowly, but\npicking up after about a second or two. But what did it do? Why didn’t it\nblank his Allomancy as it had on the train?\nMaybe it doesn’t work on the person activating it, he thought. That would\nmake some kind of sense, though he couldn’t fathom how it could tell. “Hey,\nWayne,” he said.\n“Yeah, mate?”\n“Catch.”\nWax tossed the cube to him. Wayne caught it, then jumped as his belt—\nwhich held his metal vials and any coins on his person—ripped free from its\nbreakaway straps and sprang away from him. He turned, watching it flop to\nthe ground a good twenty feet down the hill, and when he approached it, it\nscooted away.\nWax ran toward him, and as he did, the shotgun in his leg holster pressed\nbackward, as if being Pushed. The effect wore off a few seconds later, and\nby the time he reached Wayne, the cube had stopped buzzing.\nWayne held it up. “What was that?”\nWax plucked the device from his fingers as Marasi rushed over to join\nthem. “It doesn’t steal Allomancy, Wayne. It never did.”\n“But—”\n“It takes the metal one is burning,” Wax said, “and somehow … extends\nit. You saw. It Pushed your metal away, as if a Coinshot were there near you.\nThe cube used Allomancy.”\nThe three of them stood stunned, looking at the little device.\n“We need to try it again,” Wax said. “Wayne, hold this and burn your\nbendalloy. Marasi, go stand over there. Wayne, once you’re ready, throw the\ncube to her.”\nThey did as directed. Wax stood back. When Wayne ignited his metals, he\nsuddenly became a blur inside his speed bubble. The cube zipped out an\neyeblink later and soared through the air toward Marasi, deflected somewhat\nbut still moving in the right direction.\nIt engaged just before reaching her, and she became a blur, zipping over to\npick up the cube, then zipping back. It took a count of ten before the cube\nstopped working, dropping her into ordinary time.\n“Did you see that?” Marasi said, awed, holding the cube. “It created a"

It fed off Wayne’s Allomancy, and replicated it!”\n“It’s what we’ve been lookin’ for, then?” Wayne asked, joining them,\nhaving dropped his own bubble.\n“Not quite,” Wax replied, taking the cube and holding it up. “But it’s\ncertainly encouraging. It looks like you have to be an Allomancer to use this\n—it doesn’t grant new powers, but it does extend the ones you have. It’s\nlike … like an Allomantic grenade.”\nMarasi nodded eagerly. “Which means that the man on the train, the one\nwho used this on us, is a Leecher. He can remove Allomancy in others, and\nhe gave that power to the cube, which he threw at you.”\n“It engages a second or so after you throw it,” Wax said with a nod.\n“Useful.”\n“And it’s proof that Suit has technology he’s been hiding,” Marasi said.\n“We knew that from the communication device,” Wax said, “but yes, this\nis even more curious. I’m half tempted to think all this talk of the Bands of\nMourning came from rumors about this technology the Set has been\ndeveloping.”\n“And the symbols?”\n“No idea,” Wax said. “Some kind of cipher they developed?” He tapped\nthe cube, then handed the thing to Marasi.\n“Why me?” she asked.\n“It’s yours. You found it; you figured out how to turn it on. Besides, I have\na feeling it’s going to be the most effective in your hands.”\nShe held it a moment, then her eyes widened. Being a Pulser wasn’t very\nuseful when you were catching yourself in a bubble where you moved\nslowly compared to everyone else. However, if you could trap someone else\nin that bubble …\nWayne whistled softly.\n“I’ll try not to lose it,” Marasi said, tucking the device away. “We’ll need\nto study it later, find out how it works.”\nI wonder … Wax thought, remembering something else. He played his\nhunch, reaching into his pocket and fishing out the golden bracelet that\nKelesina had been wearing.\nHe tossed it to Wayne.\n“What’s this?” Wayne asked, holding it up toward the sky. “Pretty hoop o’\ngold, that is. Who’d you trade this off of? I could use this, mate. It would\nmake a nice metalmind.”\n“I think it’s already one,” Wax said, deflating. It had been a silly idea in\nthe first place.\nWayne gasped.\n“What?” Marasi said.\n“It’s a metalmind,” Wayne said. “Damn me, but it is. And I can sense it.\nWax, you got your knife?”\nWax nodded, yanking his knife from his gunbelt, and when Wayne\nproffered his hand, he sliced a small cut along the back. It resealed\nimmediately.\n“Maaaate,” Wayne whispered. “It’s someone else’s metalmind, but I can\nuse it.”\n“Like VenDell said,” Wax said, taking the bracelet from Wayne’s fingers.\n“A metalmind with no Identity.

I have to flare my metal to even get\nthe faintest line pointing to it. This thing must be stuffed full of power.”\nMore than any metalmind he’d ever sensed, in fact. He could usually push\non those without too much trouble. He’d barely be able to shift this one.\n“Why didn’t I notice what it was immediately?” Wayne said. “I had to be\ntold. And, oh, rusts! This is proof of the Bands of Mourning, ain’t it?”\n“No,” Wax said. “I can’t sense a reserve in the bracelet—I can’t use this,\nas I’m not a Bloodmaker. It’s not a metalmind anybody can use, just one that\nanyone with the right powers already can use.”\n“That’s still remarkable,” Marasi said.\n“And disturbing,” Wax said, staring at that innocent-looking loop. The\nonly way to have created this would involve using a Feruchemist with two\npowers. So either the Set had access to full-blooded Feruchemists, or his\nfears were coming true. They’d figured out how to use Hemalurgy.\nOr it’s a relic, he thought. There’s that possibility. Perhaps this and the box\nwere artifacts of another time.\nHe tossed the bracelet back to Wayne. “How much is in it?”\n“A heap,” Wayne said. “But it’s not endless. The reservoir got smaller\nwhen I healed that cut.”\n“Hang on to it, then,” Wax said, turning as he heard his name. MeLaan\nwas at the edge of the glade, waving. Wax left Wayne and Marasi, striding\nover to the tall, slender kandra woman, still worried about what these\ndiscoveries meant. What did the bracelet indicate? Was there more to be\ndiscovered? Metalminds that granted anyone who touched them incredible\npowers? For the first time, he really started to wonder. What if the Bands\nwere real? What would happen to society if Metalborn powers were simply\nsomething you could purchase?\nHe trudged up to MeLaan. “I think you’ll want to see this,” she said,\nwaving for him to follow her up the side of a steep hill covered in foliage. At\nthe top, they had a view of the land to the northeast. Some was cultivated in\nrows and rings, but much was like what they’d just left—wilderness\nblooming with random patches of fruits or vegetables. A cool breeze blew\nacross him, barely enough to temper the heat of the sunlight above.\nSeeing it all, feeling that perfect breeze, made Wax realize what annoyed\nhim so much about the problems between Elendel and the outer cities. Did\nthese people comprehend what life was like out in the Roughs, where\nplanting was fraught with uncertainty, and the danger of starvation was real?\nThey think people are foolish for living in the Roughs, Wax thought,\ntaking the old-fashioned spyglass that MeLaan handed him. They don’t\nunderstand what it’s like to get trapped out there for generations, too poor—\nor too stubborn—to return to the Basin.\nFreedom in the Roughs came at a cost.

Either way, the Basin was—\nliterally—paradise, crafted for men by a God who wanted to compensate the\nworld for a millennium of ashes and ruin. It seemed that even in paradise,\nmen would find reasons to squabble and fight.\nWax raised the spyglass. “What am I looking for?”\n“Check the road about a mile up,” MeLaan said. “By that creek with the\nbridge over it.”\nHe spotted a couple of men lounging in a field with axes. From the looks\nof it, they’d been cutting at the trunk of a dead tree. Another fallen tree\ncrossed the roadway.\n“What do you see?” MeLaan asked.\n“A roadblock that doesn’t want to look like one,” Wax said. “That tree\nacross the road is arranged to seem as if it just fell there, but the furrows on\nthe ground indicate it was dragged there intentionally, and has been moved a\ntime or two since being placed.”\n“Good eye,” MeLaan said.\n“You can’t have it,” he said, turning the spyglass and looking toward the\nfarmsteads in the area. “Soldiers stationed in that farmhouse over there, I’d\nguess. And none of the other homes have smoke rising from them. Probably\nabandoned. You’re unlikely to find a farmstead this time of day without\ndinner in the oven.”\n“They’re waiting for us?”\n“No, this is too extensive for that,” Wax said. “This is a perimeter. They’re\ntrying not to have it look like one, to prevent word from spreading, but\nthey’ve cordoned off this entire area. What the hell is happening in there?”\nMeLaan shook her head, looking baffled.\n“Well, we can’t take the coach any farther,” Wax said, handing back the\nspyglass. “How are you at bareback?”\n“Well, I haven’t thrown any riders off recently, but I don’t get occasion to\nbe a horse very often, so I can’t say how I’ll feel today.”\nWax blinked.\n“Oh, you meant riding,” MeLaan said. “Yeah, I’m fine. I doubt I’m the\none you’ll have to worry about.” She nodded back toward Steris walking\ninto the grove, trailed by Wayne, who had filled his hat with walnuts.\n“Right,” Wax said.\nHopefully some of their horses would prove docile.\n* * *\nTwilight settled upon the land fitfully, like a tired eye struggling to stay\nopen. It was the variety of the land down here in the south, Wax figured. One\nmoment you could be riding through a wooded hollow, all in shadow, and\nthe next you’d crest a hill into an open field and find that the sun hadn’t quite\ndropped below the horizon yet.\nStill, darkness did eventually arrive, but with it came no mists. Wax\nrealized he’d been longing to feel them envelop him again.\nMeLaan led the sortie, keeping to forested areas when possible. She or\nWayne would scout ahead, listening for patrols, but the Set was attempting\nto hold such a large area that they obviously couldn’t watch the whole\nwilderness. Marasi, of course, was an accomplished rider—and seemed\npleased to have a reason to change into her new constable’s trousers and\njacket."

        "text": "wilderness. Marasi, of course, was an accomplished rider—and seemed\npleased to have a reason to change into her new constable’s trousers and\njacket.\nSteris surprised him. She did just fine, even riding in a skirt. She’d packed\none full enough that she could tuck it beneath her and ride bareback without\nexposing too much. She took to it without complaint, as she’d done with\npractically everything else on this trip.\nThe few farmsteads or hunter’s camps they passed on their ride were\nempty. Wax felt a mounting disquiet. Yes, this was a small, largely\nunpopulated region in the Basin’s backwaters—but it was still profoundly\ndisturbing that the Set could dominate it so fully.\nOnce they reached the final patch of trees near the village, MeLaan\nscouted ahead, then came back and waved for him to follow. He crawled up\nwith her to peer at the village from the tree line.\nBright electric floodlights lit the perimeter around an enormous structure\nin what obviously had once been the center of the village of Dulsing.\nWooden, windowless, huge, it was still under construction, judging by the\nscaffolding at the sides and the unfinished roof at the top. The town’s\nbuildings had mostly been torn down, leaving only a few at the perimeter\nuntouched.\nThe roofless top of the building glowed with a warm light. Where were\nthey getting so much electricity? MeLaan handed him the spyglass and he\nraised it, inspecting the perimeter. Those were definitely soldiers, wearing\nred uniforms with some mark on the breast that wasn’t distinguishable at this\ndistance. They carried rifles at their shoulders, and the floodlights created a\nbright ring around the place. Focused outward, not toward the building,\nwhich left plenty of shadowed areas inside that ring. So they’d have cover\nonce they got past the perimeter.\n“What do you think?” he asked. “Is that some kind of bunker?”\n“Doesn’t look like any fort I’ve seen,” MeLaan whispered. “With those\nflimsy walls? Looks more like a big warehouse.”\nA warehouse as large as a small town. Wax shook his head in bafflement,\nthen spotted something near the far side of the village. A waterfall? It was\noutside the lights, but he thought he could see mist rising from where it\nplunged down, and a small stream did run through the village.\n“High ground that direction,” he said.\n“Yeah,” she said. “The maps mention the waterfall over there. Small but\npretty, supposedly.”\n“Must have hooked a turbine up to it,” he said. “That’s where the power is\ncoming from. Let’s get back to the others.”\nThey crawled through the underbrush again to where Wayne, Marasi, and\nSteris waited in the dim woods. “They’re here all right,” Wax whispered.\n“We have to find a way to get in. Tons of soldiers. Well-guarded perimeter.”\n“Fly in,” Steris suggested.\n“Not gonna work,” Wayne said. “They had a Seeker back at the party; you\nthink they won’t have one here? The moment one of us burns a metal, we’ll\ndraw a hundred of Suit’s goons to welcome us with a handshake and a\nfriendly bit of murderin’.”\n“What then?” Marasi asked."

He\npointed, and MeLaan led the way in the darkness, walking her horse between\nthe towering hardwoods. Wax fell in with Steris at the tail of the group, and\nlagged a little to be able to speak with her privately.\n“Steris,” he whispered, “I’ve been considering how to proceed once we\ndecide how to infiltrate. I’ve thought about bringing you in with us, and I\njust don’t see that it’s feasible. I think it would be best if you stayed and\nwatched the horses.”\n“Very well.”\n“No, really. Those are armed soldiers. I can’t even fathom how I’d feel if I\nbrought you in there and something happened. You need to stay out here.”\n“Very well.”\n“It isn’t subject to—” Wax hesitated. “Wait. You’re all right with this?”\n“Why wouldn’t I be?” she asked. “I barely have any sense of where to\npoint a gun, and have hardly any capacity for sneaking—that’s really quite a\nscandalous talent if you think about it, Lord Waxillium. While I do believe\nthat people tend to be safest when near you, riding into an enemy compound\nis stretching the issue. I’ll stay here.”\nWax grinned in the darkness. “Steris, you’re a gem.”\n“What? Because I have a moderately healthy sense of self-preservation?”\n“Let’s just say that out in the Roughs, I was accustomed to people always\nwanting to try things beyond their capacity. And they always seemed\ndetermined to do it right when it was the most dangerous.”\n“Well, I shall endeavor to stay out of sight,” Steris said, “and not get\ncaptured.”\n“I doubt you need to worry about that all the way out here.”\n“Oh, I agree,” she said. “But that is the sort of statistical anomaly that\nplagues my life, so I’ll plan for it nonetheless.”\nWith some difficulty, they navigated to the eastern edge of the town,\nwhere they left Steris and the horses. Wax dug some supplies off the pack\nanimal. Metal vials, extra bullets, plenty of guns—including the aluminum\none he’d stolen back at Kelesina’s place. And the last of Ranette’s ball-and-\nstring devices, which he tucked into the pouch on his gunbelt.\nAfter climbing up some switchbacks, they were able to settle onto a\ndarkened ridge above the falls—which were nowhere near as impressive as\nhe’d imagined—and study the town. Well, the remnants of it.\n“I wish we could see into that building,” Marasi said, handing back the\nspyglass.\nWax grunted in agreement. They were almost high enough to see what\nwas going on inside. Certainly, those flickering lights bespoke considerable\nactivity: people moving down below, passing before the lights in the large\nchamber. But what were they doing, and why were they still at it well into\nthe night?\n“Gonna be hard to sneak in there,” Wayne said.\n“You could kill one of the guards for me,” MeLaan said, settling onto a"

Honestly, if you look at\nour physiology, I share less in common with humans than you do with a cow\n—and nobody gasps when you eat one of those. You didn’t have trouble with\nit back in the mansion with Innate’s bodyguard.”\n“She was already dead,” Wax said. “Thank you for the suggestion,\nMeLaan, but getting you a guard’s body is out of the question.”\n“We don’t like killin’ folks,” Wayne said. “At least, unless they start\nshootin’ at us. They’re just chaps what are doing their job.” He looked to\nMarasi, as if for support.\n“Don’t look at me,” Marasi said. “I’m reeling from watching you trying to\ntake the moral high ground.”\n“Focus, Wayne,” Wax said. “How are we going to get in? Shall we try a\nFat Belt?”\n“Nah,” Wayne said, “too loud. I think we should do Spoiled Tomato.”\n“Dangerous,” Wax said, shaking his head. “I’d have to do the placement\njust right, between the lit perimeter and the shadowed part near the walls.”\n“You can do it. You make shots like that all the time. Plus, we got this\nshiny new metalmind, full o’ health waitin’ to be slurped up.”\n“A mistake could ruin the whole infiltration, healing power or no,” Wax\nsaid. “I think we should do Duck Under Clouds instead.”\n“You kiddin’?” Wayne said. “Didn’t you get shot last time we tried that?”\n“Kinda,” Wax admitted.\nMeLaan stared at them, baffled. “Duck under Clouds?”\n“They get like this,” Marasi said, patting her on the shoulder. “Best not to\nlisten too closely.”\n“Tube Run,” Wayne said.\n“No glue.”\n“Banefielder?”\n“Too dark.”\n“Blackwatch Doublestomp.”\nWax hesitated. “… The hell is that?”\n“Just made it up,” Wayne said, grinning. “It’s a nifty code name though,\neh?”\n“Not bad,” Wax admitted. “And what type of plan is it?”\n“Same as Spoiled Tomato,” Wayne said.\n“I said that was too dangerous.”\n“Nothin’ else will work,” Wayne said, standing. “Look, are we going to sit\nhere arguing, or are we going to do this?”\nWax debated for a moment, eyeing the grounds, thinking. Could he get the\nplacement right?\nBut then, did he have a better plan? That perimeter was very well guarded,\nbut it was a dark night.

Unfortunately, at that moment they agreed with\nWayne.\nSo, before he could talk himself out of it, he pulled his shotgun from its\nholster and tossed it to Wayne. The shorter man caught it with distaste—\nguns and Wayne didn’t agree. His arms immediately started shaking.\n“Try to hold on tight,” Wax said. “Make an opening on the north side, if\nyou can.”\nHe increased his weight, flared his metal, and Pushed on the gun, using it\nas an anchor to hurl Wayne out off the rocky outcropping and over the camp.\nThe man soared from the Push before dropping through the darkness, some\nfifty feet toward the ground below.\nMarasi gasped. “Spoiled Tomato?” she asked.\n“Yeah,” Wax said. “Apparently it makes a mess sometimes when he\nlands.”\n* * *\nTo rust with that Wax, Wayne thought as he plummeted toward the ground,\nhis hat blowing off. Tossin’ a gun to a fellow without even warnin’ him. Why,\nthat’s just—\nHe hit.\nNow, there was a trick to falling to your death. Bodies hitting the ground\nwere loud. Louder than anyone ever expected.\nHe mitigated this by hitting feet-first—his legs both snapped immediately\n—then twisted onto his side, breaking his shoulder, but dampening some of\nthe sound by rolling with the impact. He tapped his fancy new metalmind\nright before his head smacked the ground, dazing him.\nHe ended up in a crumpled, broken heap beside a pile of rocks. Of course\nWax would have sent him into a pile of rocks. As his vision cleared, he tried\nto glance at his legs, but he couldn’t move. Couldn’t feel anything, actually,\nwhich was quite pleasant. It was always nice when you snapped the spine—\nhelped with the pain.\nNot that the pain went completely away, mind you. But he and pain were\nold friends what shared a handshake and a beer now and then. Didn’t much\nlike one another, but they had a working relationship. Sensation—and agony\n—flooded back into him as his metalmind healed his spine, focusing on the\nworst wounds first. He drew in a deep breath. A snapped spine could\nsuffocate a man. People didn’t know that. Or, well, the ones who did know\nhad suffocated already.\nAs soon as he could move—even while his legs were healing—he twisted\nand used his good arm to position one of the large rocks in the pile. Looked\nlike these stones were here intended for shoring up the sides of the stream,\nperhaps to make a pathway across. Wayne put them to good use, reaching up\nwith his other hand as his shoulder healed. Wax had placed him well, right in\nthe dark area between the perimeter watchposts and the building. But that\ndidn’t mean he was safe.\nWayne stumbled to his feet, dragging Wax’s gun, his leg twisting about\nand bones reknitting. Damn fine metalmind, that gold bracelet was. An\nextensive healing like this would have cost him months of saving up, but this\nmetalmind was still mostly full.\nHe stumbled away as quietly as he could, leaving a large rock balanced on"

A pair of soldiers were approaching from the\nperimeter.\n“It was over here,” one said to the other. As they drew closer, one of the\nspotlights turned around and shone on the area, giving them light and quite\nnearly exposing Wayne. He froze in the shadows near a pile of work\nequipment, sweating as his toes popped softly, the bones grinding against\none another as they knit back into their proper places.\nThe guards didn’t hear. They stepped up to where he’d fallen—no tomato\nsplat of blood this time, fortunately—and looked around. One nudged the\nstone accidentally, and it fell off the peak where Wayne had placed it, rolling\ndown the side of the small pile and clattering against the other rocks. The\nmen looked at it, then nodded, doing a quick sweep but heading back to their\npost and returning the light to its scan of the nearby area. The noise they’d\nheard had merely been some rocks shifting. Nothing significant.\nWayne stood up straight in the darkness and stopped tapping the bracelet\nmetalmind. He felt good. Renewed, like he always did after a big healing.\nFelt like he could do something impossible, run up a mountain, or eat the\nentire boar and chips plate at Findley’s all on his own.\nHe crept off through the shadows, about important business. Fortunately,\nhe found his hat almost immediately, near another rock pile. That done, he\nmoved on to less important matters, like making an opportunity to help the\nothers sneak in.\nWax had said north side. Let’s see.… He kept close to the building, and\neven resisted the urge to go sneaking in on his own to find out what in Ruin’s\nname was in there.\nTime to think like a guard. It was hard, as he didn’t have a guard’s hat. He\nsettled into the shadows and listened as a pair of them passed on patrol,\ndigesting their accents like a nice snack of pretzel sticks with mustard.\nAfter about fifteen minutes of watching, he picked out a likely candidate\nand kept pace as the man did his rounds, though Wayne stayed in the\nshadow. The lanky fellow had a face like a rabbit, but was tall enough he\ncould probably have picked all the walnuts he wanted without needing a\nstepladder.\nHere I am, Wayne thought, in the middle of nowhere! Guarding a big old\nbarn. This isn’t what I signed up for. I haven’t seen my daughter in eight\nmonths. Eight months! She’s probably talking by now. Rusts. This life.\nThe man turned to go back the other way on his rounds, and someone\nbarked out at him from one of the stations with the floodlights, saying\nsomething Wayne couldn’t hear. The tone was unmistakable.\nAnd my superiors, Wayne thought, turning and slinking along in the\nshadows, still keeping pace with the man. Oh, how they lean on me!

Being yelled\nat day in and day out.\nWayne smiled, then scuttled ahead of the man, looking for something he’d\nstepped over earlier. A set of black cords, each as thick as his finger, plugged\ninto a big box near the building. As the guard came strolling past, not paying\nmuch attention, Wayne carefully lifted the cords.\nThe guard’s foot caught on them. In that moment, Wayne yanked them\nfrom the hub.\nThe floodlights nearest to him went out.\nMen immediately started shouting. The guard panicked in the darkness.\n“I’m sorry!” he shouted. “I didn’t mean to. I wasn’t watching my feet!”\nWayne slipped away and found a nice quiet nook between two stacks of\nsandbags as the guards shouted and argued, and the poor man was chewed\nout. Some people came in to fix the cords, though Wayne had tossed them to\nthe side, so it took some time searching in the dark to find the ends and get\nthem connected.\nThe lights came back on. Wayne was taking a long swig from his leather\ncanteen as Wax, Marasi, and MeLaan joined him in the shadows. “Nice,”\nWax whispered.\n“It wasn’t, actually,” Wayne whispered. “It was pretty mean. That poor\nguard ain’t done nothin’ wrong, and everybody keeps yellin’ at him.”\nWax took the lead at that point, prowling along the side of the big barnlike\nbuilding. The roof wasn’t the only thing still unfinished—the entrances were\nopen, not fitted with proper doors. They stopped beside one and Wayne\npointed, whispering to Wax where his shotgun was.\nWax fetched it, then snuck through the doorway. They followed, Wayne\nlast of all. The cavernous interior was lit by a few electric lanterns here and\nthere, and they passed a long light lattice that was obviously going to be\ninstalled in the ceiling, once the roof was done. It was brighter than outside\nin here, but not by much, and there were stacks of boxes and supplies\narranged in rows, which let them sneak through and stay hidden. Once they\ngot to the front of the rows of boxes, Wax hesitated, and the two women\npeered around him. Nobody gave Wayne a good view, which was how it\nalways went. First he got yelled at on the job, then this.\nHe wiggled between them, getting a good elbow into Marasi’s midriff—\nwhich earned him a glare, as if she didn’t know that proper crowd-wiggling\nprotocol involved getting friendly with one another’s extremities. He\nmanaged to peek between Wax and MeLaan, finally getting a glimpse at\nwhat had stopped them.\nIt was a boat.\nOf course, the common word “boat” didn’t do the thing justice. Wayne\nstared at the massive construction, searching for a better description. One\nthat would capture the majesty, the incredible scale, of the thing he was\nseeing.\n“That’s a damn big boat,” he finally whispered.\nMuch better.\nWhy would they be building a ship here, miles and miles from the ocean?\nThe thing couldn’t be easy to move.

It filled almost the entire building, with\na curved bottom and a prow—unfinished on one side—that was easily three\nstories high. The thing had two long, armlike extensions at the sides.\nPontoons? They were big, and one wasn’t finished yet, ending in a jagged\nline of construction.\nJagged? Wayne frowned. That didn’t look like the way you built\nsomething. In fact, now that he studied it, that prow looked more crumpled\nthan unfinished.\n“Someone broke it,” Wayne said, pointing. “They were trying to move it,\nand cracked off one pontoon.”\n“It has to be a warship,” Marasi said. “They are preparing for a war.”\n“I think Wayne is right,” Wax said. “Look at the gouges in the dirt, the\ndamage to the hull. They were transporting this thing through here, and it\nrolled free and cracked. So the Set constructed this building to cut it off from\nthe view of anyone outside while they repair it.”\n“Engineers,” Wayne said, pointing at some people who were obviously\nsmart types, walking along the outside of the ship and pointing, carrying\nclipboards and wearing dark brown suits and skirts. The type teachers at\nschools would wear, thinking they were the height of fashion.\n“It’s not like any ship I’ve seen,” Marasi said, shouldering her purse and\nclutching her rifle.\n“You brought your purse,” Wayne said, “on a darin’ infiltration?”\n“Why not?” she said. “Purses are handy. Anyway, if the Set has\ntechnology like that speaking telegraph, what will they put on a ship like\nthis? And why did they build it away from the sea in the first place?”\n“Suit will have answers,” Wax said, eyes narrowing. “Marasi, I assume\nyou’re still after the spike?”\n“Yes,” she said, determined.\n“I’m going to find my uncle. Who do you want? Wayne or MeLaan?”\n“MeLaan this time,” Marasi said.\nWax nodded. “Stay hidden, but if Wayne and I get spotted, try to help.\nWe’ll do the same for you. If you find that spike, return to this point and lie\nlow. If all goes well, we’ll slip back out together.”\n“And if all doesn’t go well?”\n“Which it won’t,” Wayne added.\n“Meet back where we left Steris and the horses,” Wax said, sliding a gun\nfrom the holster at his side. MeLaan did the same, only her holster was her\nleg. Like, the skin split and she reached in through a slit in her trousers and\nslipped the gun out—a sleek, long-barreled thing.\nWayne whistled softly. She grinned, then gave him a kiss. “Try not to get\nshot too many times.”\n“You neither,” he said.\nThey split up.\n18\nMarasi snuck through the warehouse, her rifle’s strap an uncomfortable\nweight on her shoulder.

The warehouse was hardly silent. Though it was night, and\nactivity was muted, some people were still working. Along one side of the\nroom, a few carpenters sawed lengths of wood, each stroke echoing back\nfrom the walls. The group of engineers made exclamations as they discussed\naspects of the large vessel.\nThey seem surprised by it, Marasi thought. As if they’re not the ones who\nbuilt it in the first place. Were they new to the project, then?\nGuards dotted the warehouse, but there weren’t nearly as many as outside.\nShe and MeLaan kept to the shadowed edge of the chamber, near the piles of\nboxes and supplies, but still had to pass uncomfortably close to a group of\nsoldiers sitting at a small table playing cards.\nThe soldiers didn’t notice them. Eventually, MeLaan and Marasi managed\nto reach the south wall, which was one of the long sides of the rectangular\nbuilding. Here, rooms had been built into the structure, and they were more\nfinished than the rest, complete with doors and the occasional window.\n“Living quarters?” Marasi whispered, pointing.\n“Maybe,” MeLaan replied, crouching beside her. “So how are we going to\nfind the spike?”\n“I’d assume it’s inside a safe of some sort.”\n“Maybe,” MeLaan said. “Or it could be in a desk drawer in one of those\nrooms, or packed away in a box … or hell, they may have just thrown it\naway. Suit only seemed to want it because he required proof that poor\nReLuur had been dealt with.”\nMarasi took a deep breath. “If that’s the case, we’ll have to interrogate\nSuit once Waxillium finds him. But I don’t think they threw it away. We\nknow the Set is researching ways to make Allomancers, and we know\nthey’re interested in Hemalurgy. They’d study the spike instead of tossing\nit.”\nMeLaan nodded thoughtfully. “But it could still be practically anywhere.”\nNot far away, the scientists—led by a man with a limp—walked up a\nplank ramp, peering into the open side of the boat. It’s him, Marasi thought.\nThe same one from the train robbery. He was showing the newcomers\naround the project.\nThey stepped inside.\n“I’ve got an idea,” Marasi said.\n“How crazy is it?”\n“Less crazy than tossing Wayne off a cliff.”\n“Not a high bar, but all right. How do we start?”\nMarasi pointed at the hole in the hull that the scientists had entered\nthrough. “We get in there.”\n* * *\nWax moved along behind the supply pallets in the direction opposite\nMarasi’s, feeling as if he were stepping through the shadow of progress.\nHe’d pondered the transformations that Elendel had undergone during his\nabsence: motorcars and electric lights, skyscrapers and concrete roads. It was\nlike he’d left one world and come back to another.\nThat seemed only the beginning. Enormous warships. Technology that\nenhanced Allomancy.

He couldn’t help but feel intimidated, as if this behemoth ship\nwere a soldier from another time, come to stamp out all the dusty old relics\nlike Wax.\nHe pulled up beside the last stack of planks in the line, Wayne joining\nhim. The man yanked out his canteen, which was of sturdy, stiff leather,\nworked to the shape of a small bottle. He took a swig and offered it to Wax,\nwho accepted it and downed a drink.\nHe coughed softly. “Apple juice?”\n“Good for the body,” Wayne said, tucking the canteen away.\n“I was not expecting that.”\n“Gotta keep the stomach guessin’, mate,” Wayne said. “Or it’ll grow\ncomplacent and all. How’re we gonna find your uncle?”\n“Perspective?” Wax asked, nodding toward the middle reaches of the\nwarehouse, where a complex network of temporary construction catwalks\nringed the inside of the building. They were unpopulated in the night. “We’d\nhave a view of the entire area, but wouldn’t be too noticeable from below.”\n“Sounds good,” Wayne said. “You up for it, though? You’re gonna have to\nclimb up like a regular person. No Steelpushes.”\nHe didn’t have any metal inside of him—too easy to use reflexively. His\nvials sat unused on his belt.\n“I’ll be fine,” Wax said dryly. He waited until nearby guards and workers\nhad passed, then led the way in a low run along the shadows of the building.\nThe lights were aimed on the ship, away from the walls. He had to hope that\nthe few workers walking about weren’t focused on the dark reaches of the\nlarge chamber.\nTwo full-sized catwalks ran the length of the wall up high, and leading\ntoward them were a series of ladders and shorter catwalks as landings, to\nhold supplies. He grabbed the bottom ladder and climbed up one level, then\nanother. By the third one, his arms were aching. He made himself lighter,\nwhich helped, but he still had to stop and catch his breath on the fifth tier.\nJust as making his body heavier granted him the strength to move his\noversized muscles, getting lighter always seemed to cost him some of his\nstrength.\n“Gettin’ old,” Wayne said with a grin, passing him and starting up the next\nladder.\n“Don’t be dense,” Wax said, grabbing the ladder below him and climbing.\n“I’m trying to pace myself. What if we reach the top and have to fight?”\n“You can throw your wooden teeth at ’em,” Wayne said from above. “Do\nsome cane waggin’ as well. I’m sure you’re cross about stayin’ up so late.”\nWax growled softly and climbed up onto the next tier, but in fact he was\nwinded to the point that arguing was taxing. The younger man seemed to\nrealize it, and had a wide grin on his face as they climbed up the final two\ntiers to the bottom catwalk.\n“I should deck you right in your grin,” he grumbled as he joined the still-\nsmiling Wayne on the catwalk. “But you’d just heal.”"

Considerin’ your age, it’s\nmore important to make you feel you’ve accomplished somethin’ in a day.”\nWax shook his head, turning and stepping to the side along the catwalk.\nThe board under his foot immediately cracked. His leg slipped through, and\nthough he caught himself and yanked the foot out, for the first time in ages\nhe felt a little of what others must feel at being up so high. That ground was\nfar, far below, and he didn’t have any metals in him at the moment.\nHe growled and stepped around the hole. “That was not my fault. The\nboard was weak.”\n“Sure, sure,” Wayne said. “It’s okay, mate. Most folks put on a little\nweight as they hit their twilight years. ’S natural and all.”\n“If I shot you,” Wax said, “nobody would blame me. They’d probably just\nsay, ‘Wow. You lasted that long? I’d have shot him years ago.’ Then they’d\nbuy me a pint.”\n“Now, that hurts, it does,” Wayne said. “I—”\n“Who are you?”\nWax froze, then both he and Wayne looked upward toward the person\nleaning out over the railing of the upper catwalk, staring down at them. An\nengineer, by the looks of it, in a white coat over vest and cravat. He frowned\nat them, then seemed to recognize Wax, his eyes widening.\n“Rust,” Wax swore, raising his hands as Wayne moved immediately,\njumping up. Wax gave him a boost, and he kicked off and grabbed the railing\nof the upper catwalk. The engineer started to cry out, but Wayne snatched\nthe man’s ankle, toppling him with a thump.\nWayne swung up in a heartbeat, and another thump sounded. Wax waited,\nnervous. Moments passed.\n“Wayne?” he hissed. “Are you up there?”\nA moment later, the engineer’s unconscious face appeared over the side of\nthe catwalk, eyes closed.\n“Of course he’s up here,” Wayne said from up above, imitating the voice\nof the unfortunate engineer and wiggling the head like a puppet’s. “You just\ntossed that bloke up here, mate! You’ve forgotten already? Memory loss.\nYou must be gettin’ real old.”\n* * *\nTechnically, every person in the world was dying—they were merely doing\nit very slowly. Irich’s curse was not that he was dying. It was that he could\nfeel it happening.\nAs he shuffled down the hallways of the enormous wooden ship, he had to\nkeep close watch on the floor, because the slightest dip or cleft could cause\nhim to trip. When he gestured toward the wall where they’d found the\nburned maps—explaining to the other scientists—his arm felt as if it were\nstrapped with a ten-pound weight.\nHis left hand barely worked anymore; he could grip his cane, but he\ncouldn’t stop his hand from trembling as he did so—and he practically had\nto drag his left leg with each step.

His\nphysician said that one day, he simply wouldn’t have the strength to breathe.\nOn that day, Irich would suffocate alone, unable to move. And he could\nfeel it coming. Step by excruciating step.\n“And what is this, Professor Irich?” Stanoux asked, gesturing toward the\nceiling. “Such a fascinating pattern!”\n“We aren’t certain,” Irich said, leaning on his cane and looking upward—a\ntask that was surprisingly difficult. Rusts. He hadn’t had trouble tipping his\nhead back before, had he?\nStep by step.\n“It looks like a ship,” Stansi said, cocking her head.\nIndeed, the golden pattern on the corridor ceiling did look something like\na small ship. Why paint it here? He suspected it would take years to sort out\nthis vessel’s many secrets. Once, Irich would have been content to spend his\nentire life picking through these oddities, writing about each and every one.\nToday however, his “entire life” seemed far too short a period to be spent\non such endeavors. Suit and Sequence wanted their weapons, and they could\nhave them, for Irich desired only one thing.\nA miracle.\n“Please, continue with me,” Irich said, walking down the corridor with his\nlatest gait. He had to develop a new one every few months, as more of his\nmuscles grew too weak or refused to function. Step, cane, shuffle, breathe.\nStep, cane, shuffle, breathe.\n“What marvelous woodwork!” Stanoux said, adjusting his spectacles.\n“Aunt, do you recognize what kind of wood this is?”\nStansi stepped up beside him, waving over the guard with the lantern so\nshe could admire the strange hardwood. Irich had shown similar interest in\nthe ship’s details at first, but each day his patience grew more strained.\n“Please,” Irich said. “You shall have all the time you wish to study, prod,\nand theorize. But only after we have solved the primary problem.”\n“Which is?” Stansi asked.\nIrich gestured toward an arched doorway ahead, guarded by a soldier with\nanother lantern. She saluted as Irich passed. Technically, he was an Array—a\nrank of some influence within the Set. Suit and his people had a high regard\nfor scientific thought. The power and prestige, however, were meaningless to\nhim. Neither could grant him additional breaths of life.\nPast the doorway, he waved for his group of five scientists to gaze upon\nthe grand machinery that filled the hold of the strange vessel. It was like\nnothing he had ever seen, without gears or wires. It looked more like a\nhearth, only constructed of a lightweight metal with lines of other metals\nrunning away from it along the walls. Like a spiderweb.\n“This ship,” Irich said, “is filled with enigmas. You have noticed the odd\npatterns on the ceilings, but questions like those are barely the beginning.\nWhat is the purpose of the room hung with dozens of black hoods, like those\nworn by an executioner?

For whom were these built? People of the lower class?\nFamilies? A third gender? So many questions.\n“One question tops them all, and we feel that answering it will provide the\nvery linchpin. It is why I have called for you, the most brilliant minds of the\nouter cities. If you can answer this, we will gain the technological might to\nsecure our freedom from Elendel oppression once and for all.”\n“And what question might that be?” Professor Javie asked.\nIrich turned back to them. “Why, how this thing moves of course.”\n“You don’t know?”\nIrich shook his head. “It defies all scientific knowledge available to us.\nSome mechanisms were undoubtedly damaged in the crash, but as you can\nsee, the vehicle is mostly intact. We should have been able to ascertain its\nmethod of propulsion, but so far it eludes us.”\n“What of the navigators?” Stanoux asked. “The crew? Did none survive?”\n“They have been uncooperative,” Irich said. And somewhat fragile.\n“Beyond that, the language barrier has so far proven insurmountable. That is\nwhy I invited you, Lord Stanoux, as one of the world’s foremost experts on\nancient, anteverdant languages. Perhaps you can decipher the books found\non this ship. Lady Stansi, you and Professor Javie will lead our engineers.\nImagine the power we would have with a fleet of such ships. We would\ndominate the Basin!”\nThe scientists shared looks. “I don’t know that I want any group having\naccess to such power, Professor,” Lady Stansi said.\nAh, right. These were not politicians. He should not employ the same\nrhetoric he had used when Suit sent him to gather funds from the wealthy.\n“Yes,” he admitted, “it will be a terrible burden. But surely you can see that\nthis knowledge is better off in our hands, rather than in the hands of those at\nElendel? And think of what we will learn, what we could know.”\nThey took that better, nodding in turn. He would have to speak with Suit\n—these people must not see themselves as serving a totalitarian army, but a\nbenign freedom movement seeking knowledge and peace. That would be\ndifficult, with all these rusted soldiers marching about and saluting everyone.\nHe prepared for an explanation of what they knew, intending to divert the\nscientists with promises of knowledge, when he heard a voice echo down the\nhallway. “Professor Irich?”\nHe sighed. What now? “Excuse me,” he said. “Lady Stansi, perhaps you\nwill wish to inspect this fixture, which appears to provide some kind of\npower to the ship. It does not have electricity, so far as we can discern. I\nwould value your unbiased opinions before I tell you what we have\nconcluded.

He had thought that on\nthe train, they might find …\nBut no, of course not. An idle hope. He should never have left this project.\nBack in the hallway, he found no sign of the person who had called to him.\nFrustrated, he made it all the way back to the doorway before turning and\nsearching down one of the side hallways. They should know better than to\ncall for him! Could they not see the difficulty he had in traversing even a\nshort distance?\nHe started back up the hallway, but hesitated as he noticed a small storage\ncompartment that had popped open on the wall. There were hundreds of\nthese scattered throughout the ship, containing ropes or weapons or other\nitems. But this one had dropped something to the floor. A small, silvery cube.\nHis heart leaped in excitement. Another of the devices? Such luck! He had\nthought all these compartments searched by now. He struggled to pick it up,\ngoing down on his good knee and fishing for it, then lurched back to his feet.\nA plan was already forming. He would tell Suit that it had been recovered\nby one of his spies in New Seran. His punishments would be lifted, and\nperhaps he would be allowed to move to the second site, perhaps join the\nexpedition.\nExcited, he sent a soldier to watch the scientists, then hobbled out of the\nship, glad that something was finally going right for him.\n* * *\nMarasi cracked a closet door within the strange ship, then looked after the\nman called Irich, who limped through the gaping hole in the wall. MeLaan\nslipped out of a closet across the hallway from her and held up a warding\nhand to Marasi, then snuck to the opening to watch where Irich went.\nMarasi waited, anxious. Though her duties as a constable usually related\nmore to analysis and investigation, she’d gone on her share of raids in\nElendel. She’d thought herself hardened, but Harmony, this mission was\nstarting to rub her nerves raw. Too little sleep, and so much sneaking about,\nhiding, knowing that at any moment someone could turn a corner and find\nyou there, looking guilty as sin.\nMeLaan finally waved her forward, and she scrambled out of the closet\nand knelt beside the kandra at the entrance.\n“He went into that room,” MeLaan said, pointing at a door along the wall.\n“Now what?”\n“We wait just a bit longer,” Marasi said. “And see if he comes back out.”\n* * *\nWax prowled along the wooden planks of the interior scaffolding.

Where were\nthe masts? He’d assumed them torn down, but from above, he could see no\nbroken stumps. So, was this ship propelled through the water by a steam\nengine, perhaps? Gasoline?\nAfter rounding the entire building on the catwalk, he saw no sign of his\nuncle.\n“Still nothing?” Wayne asked as he lowered the spyglass a last time.\nWax shook his head. “There are some rooms built into the north side of\nthe structure. He could be in there. He might also be inside the ship.”\n“So what do we try next?”\nWax tapped the end of the spyglass against his palm. He’d been struggling\nwith the same question. How did he find his prey without alerting the guards\ncamped outside?\nWayne nudged him. Down below, the limping man came back out of the\nboat. Wax focused the spyglass on him, watching as he crossed to one of the\nnearby rooms.\n“Did he look anxious about somethin’ to you?” Wayne asked.\n“Yeah,” Wax said, lowering the spyglass. “What did those two women do\nin there?”\n“Maybe they—”\n“I don’t want to hear your guess,” Wax said. “Really.”\n“Fair enough.”\n“Come on,” Wax said, leading the way back around the shadowed\ncatwalks toward the ladders.\n“You have an idea?” Wayne asked.\n“More of an impression,” Wax said. “Suit doesn’t like talking to minions.\nEveryone we’ve interviewed indicates the same thing—he chooses\nunderlings with some power and repute and lets them handle things. Miles,\nthe Marksman. My uncle loathes being bothered.”\n“So…”\n“That man with the limp,” Wax said, “probably has a similar role here.\nHe’s an Allomancer, and I heard him referenced in Lady Kelesina’s mansion;\nhe’s an important underling, though perhaps not in favor right now. Either\nway, he likely reports directly to my uncle.”\n“So follow him long enough…” Wayne said.\n“… and we should find Suit.”\n“Sounds good,” Wayne said. “Unless he reports every afternoon at tea,\nwhich would have us waitin’ a long time.”\nWax paused by the ladder, noticing with surprise that the man with the\nlimp had already left the rooms. Wax’s view was partially obscured by the\nmassive ship, but he did catch sight of the man hobbling around the front of\nthe vessel, again walking with a determined air.\nWax held up a hand to Wayne, then crouched down with the spyglass. The\nlimping man crossed the warehouse to a solitary room, much like a guard\nchamber, built into the southwest corner. A soldier here stepped aside, letting\nthe limping man enter. As the door swung open, Wax got a good glimpse of\nthe room beyond.\nHis sister was inside.\nHe almost dropped the spyglass. The door swung shut, so he couldn’t get\na second glimpse, but he had seen her. Sitting at a small table, loomed over\nby the large Coinshot brute Wax had fought on the train.\n“Wax?” Wayne asked."

Look, I’ve got an idea.”\n“How bad an idea is it?”\n“Compared to burnin’ Allomancy, going in shooting, and inevitably\ndrawing the attention of all those guards, not to mention the Set’s kill\nsquads? I’d say compared to that, it’s a pretty damn good idea.”\n“Tell me.”\n“Well, see,” Wayne said, sticking his gum to one of the catwalk’s support\nbeams, “we’ve got this very nice engineer’s outfit over there on the\nunconscious fellow, and ever since that party half a year back, I been\nworkin’ on my smart-person talk.…”\n19\nMarasi waited inside the ship, forcing herself—with effort—to remain calm.\nHow did Waxillium do it? He and Wayne could be so relaxed, it seemed like\nthey could take a nap in the middle of a firefight.\nWell, she stood her ground—or rather, knelt it—and was rewarded.\nThrough the hole in the ship’s hull, she watched the wall of the warehouse\nwhere the rooms were. Irich soon hobbled out of one, then shuffled off and\ncalled toward some guards.\n“What was that he said?” Marasi asked.\n“He told them to ‘Send to Mister Suit,’” MeLaan said. “You think he\nreally stashed that device in the same place as they’re keeping the spike?”\n“That’s the hope,” Marasi said.\n“Shall we?”\nMarasi nodded, then prepared herself for another nerve-racking\nexperience. MeLaan led, strolling down the planks and out into the open.\nMarasi followed, keeping her head high as MeLaan had told her. Look like\nyou belong, the kandra had said. The first rule of impersonation is to belong.\nShe felt completely exposed, as if she were dancing naked in the middle\nof Elendel’s Hub. They reached the bottom of the gangway, walking with\nexcruciating slowness, and crossed the floor of the warehouse to the door.\nWas Marasi walking too stiffly?

The two of\nthem stepped through into an empty hallway, and Marasi shut the door. No\nshouts of alarm followed. She was positive one of the carpenters had glanced\nat them, but nobody had said a word.\n“Nice work,” MeLaan said.\n“I feel like I’m going to puke.”\n“Must run in the family,” MeLaan said, leading her along the hallway. It\nhad bare wooden walls and smelled of sawdust, and a solitary electric light\nhung from the ceiling. Melaan stopped at the simple door at the end, listened\ncarefully, then tried the knob. This one was locked.\n“You can open it?” Marasi said. “Like you did before?”\n“Sure,” MeLaan said, kneeling by the doorknob. “No problem. I’ll try\nsomething more mundane first.” She cocked her hand, and a set of picks\nsprouted from the skin of her forearm. She plucked them free and started\nworking on the door.\n“Handy,” Marasi said.\n“Pun intended?”\n“That depends,” she said, checking over her shoulder. The hallway was\nstill empty. Fool girl. “How many times have you heard that joke?”\nMeLaan smiled, focused on her lockpicking. “I’ve been alive pushing\nseven hundred years now, kid. You’ll have trouble finding jokes I haven’t\nheard.”\n“You know, I should really interview you sometime.”\nMeLaan cocked an eyebrow in her direction.\n“You kandra have a unique perspective on society,” Marasi explained\nsoftly. “You’ve seen trends, movements across large scales.”\n“I suppose,” MeLaan said, twisting her lockpick. “What good does it do?”\n“Statistics show that if we make subtle changes to our environment—the\nway we approach our legal system, or employment rates, maybe even our\ncity layout—we can positively influence the people living in that\nenvironment. Your head may hold the key to what those changes should be!\nYou’ve seen society evolve, move; you’ve watched the shifting of peoples\nlike the tides on a beach.”\n“My thigh,” MeLaan said, twisting the doorknob with a click, then\npushing the door open a crack. She nodded, standing up straight.\n“Your … what?” Marasi asked.\n“You said my head might hold the key,” MeLaan said, striding into the\nchamber beyond—a small, surprisingly well-furnished room. “It’s actually\nmy thigh, right now. A kandra stores its cognitive system through its entire\nbody, but my memories right now are in a solid metal compartment in my\nthigh. Safer that way. People aim for the head.”\n“So what’s in your head?”\n“Eyes, sensory apparatus,” MeLaan said. “And an emergency canteen.”\n“You’re kidding.”\n“Nope,” MeLaan said, hands on hips, scanning the room. Another door on\nthe left led farther into the system of rooms built along the side of the\nwarehouse, but there were no windows out to the main chamber, which was\ngood.\nThough the room smelled of new sawdust, like the rest of the building,"

Light from a small electric desk lamp revealed a tidy study, with\nrows of books in a bookcase, two plush chairs with a maroon and yellow\npattern in front of the desk, and several decorative plants that probably had\nto be rotated outside each day to keep from wilting.\nMarasi trailed through the room, noting its oddities. Every room had them\n—marks of individuality, clues to the life of the occupant. The desk drawers\nhad wide, exaggerated handles on them. The stand lamp in the corner had\nbeen bolted to the wooden floor, as had the chairs, likely to keep them in\nplace should Irich stumble into them. Marasi was not familiar with the man’s\ndisease, but it appeared he liked his chambers to accommodate a little\nfumbling.\nMeLaan went straight for the bookcase, then began pulling books off,\ntoppling them to the ground. “It’s always behind the books,” she said.\n“People don’t like to read, they like to be seen as someone who reads. I—”\n“MeLaan?” Marasi said, then pointed to the large safe in the corner.\n“Ah,” MeLaan said, mid-ransack. She knocked the last few books off the\nshelf, perhaps for completeness’s sake, then strode to the safe. “Hmm …\nThis is going to be a little tougher. Can’t crack something like this with a set\nof picks.”\n“Can you manage it?” Marasi asked.\n“Patience,” MeLaan said. “Bring over that lamp.”\nMarasi took it from the desk, stretching out the cord to its fullest and\ndirecting its light for MeLaan.\n“Hmmm…” MeLaan said, then pressed her hand against the safe, ignoring\nthe dial. Her fingers and palm went translucent, and then her flesh began to\nwiggle, squeezing into the joints, leaving behind crystalline bones held\ntogether with the barest of sinew.\nMarasi swallowed, mouth suddenly tasting bitter. She’d known MeLaan\ncould do this, but watching it was something else. She busied herself\npropping the lamp on the arm of the desk chair to give MeLaan light, though\nthe kandra now knelt with eyes closed, so who knew if she needed it any\nlonger? Marasi then started rummaging through the desk drawers to see if\nshe could find anything important.\nHarmony send that Irich goes back to the scientists after this, Marasi\nthought, instead of returning here to catch up on paperwork.\n“The world back then,” MeLaan said suddenly, “wasn’t all that different\nfrom the one now.”\nMarasi hesitated. MeLaan still knelt with her eyes closed, her strange\nbones exposed. The flesh had gone translucent all the way up to her elbow.\n“What do you mean?” Marasi asked.\n“People talk about that time,” MeLaan said. “The time of the Lord\nMistborn, right after the Catacendre. They speak of it in hushed tones as if it\nwere some time of legends.”\n“It was,” Marasi said. “The Counselor of Gods, Hammond, Allrianne"

They forged a new world.”\n“Yeah, sure,” MeLaan said. “But they also squabbled like children, and\neach one had their own vision of what this ‘new world’ should be. Half the\nreason you’re having troubles now was because they didn’t care about\nsettlements outside of Elendel. The Originators were big-city people,\nthrough and through. You want trends? Want to know what I’ve seen?\nPeople are people. Hell, even kandra act the same, in our own way. Life then\nwas like life now, only you have better street food.”\nMarasi pondered this, then turned back to the desk. She’d still want to\ninterview some kandra—but perhaps ones who were a little more …\nreflective than MeLaan.\nIn the desk, she found a notebook with some of Irich’s observations and\nsketches about the ship, written in a shaky scrawl, along with a map of the\narea. The more she discovered, the more certain she was that the Set hadn’t\nbuilt this vessel. They were studying it as much as repairing it.\nMarasi tucked the book into her purse. See, handy, she thought. After that,\nshe rose to check the other door out of the room. She wouldn’t want to have\nsome random carpenter wander in. She cracked it open and peeked into a\ncompletely dark room, and was immediately hit with a pungent odor like\nthat of the slums. Unwashed bodies, dirt and grime. Frowning, she opened\nthe door wider.\nThe shaded illumination of the lamp—which faced the wrong way to give\ndirect light—crept hesitantly into the room. Shadows stretched long from a\nfew bare tables and a stack of boxes. And beyond them … were those cages?\nYes. Perhaps four feet tall, with thick bars, the cages looked like the type you\nmight use to contain a large animal.\nThey were empty. “MeLaan?” Marasi asked, glancing at the kandra—who\ndid not respond. She looked utterly absorbed by her task.\nMarasi inched into the room, wishing for another light. What did they\nkeep in here? Guard dogs? She hadn’t seen any of those at the perimeter. She\nstopped near one of the three large cages, bending over to see if she could\ndetermine what kind of animal had been kept in it.\nSomething rustled in the next cage over. Marasi’s breath caught. What\nshe’d mistaken for a lump of blankets or pillows was moving. She glanced\ntoward the desk in the other room, where she’d set her rifle.\nThe thing lurched and slammed against the bars.\nMarasi gasped, jumping away, her back crashing against the stack of\nnearby boxes. Inside the cage, dim light reflected from a too-flat face of red\nand black. Dark pits of eyes.\nThe pictures. Marasi had forgotten the pictures that ReLuur had left.\nHorrible faces of red and black, with those deep, dark eyes. Images as if\nfrom a nightmare, drawn in frantic, scribbled strokes.\nThe monsters were real. And there was one in the cage here, swathed in\nthick fur, face of polished red.

It regarded her, silent, then reached out\nbetween the bars with a shockingly human hand and whispered a single\nword through lips that somehow didn’t move.\n“Please.”\n* * *\nWayne turned down his saunter and added a fair measure of scramble to his\nstep instead. This engineer, he didn’t like being here, among all these\nsoldiers. He’d spent his life building houses and working on skyscrapers,\nand now here he was, basically in the middle of a bivouac!\nThat ship was marvelous, but he had a distinct worry. It was secret. And\nsecret projects were the kind where little men like himself disappeared when\neverything was finished.\nNo, something’s wrong, Wayne thought, halfway across the floor of the\nwarehouse. He didn’t stop walking, but he turned his steps in a little circle,\nlike he was pacing. Something was wrong, but what was it?\n“Wayne?” Wax hissed from the shadows nearby, crouched beside a barrel\nof pitch.\nWayne ignored him, continuing his loop. He … he was a scientist. No, no,\nan engineer. He was a working man. Learned enough, but not some fancy\nprofessor who was paid to stand all day and talk. He built things, and he\nhated being in this place, with all its guns. He encouraged life, and the\nsoldiers were the opposite of that. They, they …\nNo, he thought again, raising hands to the sides of his head. Wrong,\nwrong, wrong!\nShape up, Wayne. This was your plan. You’ve gotta make it work.\nWhat was wrong? He … He was a …\nHe stopped. Then reached into the pocket of his vest and took out a\ncharcoal pencil. He held it up, inspecting it, before slipping it behind his ear.\nHe let out a long sigh.\nHe was an engineer. A no-nonsense man who saw that things got done. He\nliked it here, as they had a military way about them—they said what they\nwanted, and were straight with him. Men were rewarded for hard work.\nHe didn’t like all those guns. And he certainly didn’t like the men in\ncharge of this place. There was something off about them. But he held his\ntongue.\nRelaxing, Wayne crossed the rest of the way to the door guard. False nose,\nmustache, a little extra air in the cheeks to fatten his face, and a perpetual\nsquint in the right eye. Came from looking at plans all the time, he figured.\nBut he didn’t need a monocle. Those things looked downright stupid.\nHe stepped up to the guard. “The lattice supports of the apricity are\ncompletely liminal!”\nThe man blinked at him.\n“Don’t just stand there!” Wayne said, waving toward the walls of the\nwarehouse. “Can’t you see that the forebode malefactors are starting to bow?\nWe could have a full-blown bannock on our hands at any minute!”\n“What…” the guard said. “What am I supposed to—”\n“Please,” Wayne said, pushing him aside—the man let him—and pulling\nopen the door.\nThe scene beyond was as Wax had described it. That was Telsin, all right."

That was Telsin, all right.\nDark hair, rugged body. Almost like a Roughs woman. He’d seen her\nevanotypes all over the mansion. Looked older now. Being a prisoner could\ndo that to somebody.\nTweaked-leg and thick-neck stood beside her table, and both turned with\nannoyance toward him.\nNow, Wayne thought, focusing on tweaked-leg, the real test.\n“We’ve got a serious problem,” Wayne said. “I’ve been checking the\nintegrity of the structure, and the caronals are completely nepheligenous out\nthere! We are about to have a full-blown case of ximelolagnia if somebody\ndoesn’t do something.”\nThe bespectacled man looked at Wayne, blinked once, then said, “Well, of\ncourse we will, you idiot. But what do we do about it?”\nWayne held back a smile, tucking it into his pocket for later use. It seemed\nto him that the smarter a man was, the more likely he was to pretend he\nknew more than he did. Like the way the drunkest fellow at the pub was\nalways the one who was most sure he could handle another pint. Tweaked-\nleg would sooner sell his own grandmother as a footstool than admit he\ndidn’t know what Wayne was talking about.\n“Quickly,” Wayne said, gesturing. “We’ve got to hold it up while I ratchet\nthe saprostomous underlays! You’ll need to supervise while I work!”\nTweaked-leg sighed, but walked out. Thankfully, his thick-necked\ncompanion followed. Within moments, Wayne had this guy pushing against\nthe supports of the ship’s pontoon while tweaked-leg observed, a few guards\njoining in to help.\nA soft thump from behind indicated that Wax had dealt with the guard at\nthe door. Normally Wayne would feel left out, since he didn’t get to do any\nhitting. This time though, Wayne got to make a bunch of idiots stand with\ntheir hands pressed against some wood, thinking they were keeping the ship\nfrom tipping over.\nSo it evened out.\n* * *\n“Please.”\nThe creature spoke with a strange accent, but the voice was unmistakably\nhuman. Marasi breathed in and out in sharp breaths, regarding that hand\nreaching for her. A human hand.\nLips that didn’t move … polished skin … That wasn’t a face, but a mask.\nThis wasn’t some horrible creature, but a person in a wooden mask, the\neyeholes caught by the shadows. What Marasi had mistaken for fur was\nthick blankets clutched around the person’s shoulders.\n“Marasi?” MeLaan asked. The kandra appeared in the doorway. “I got it\nopen. What are you doing— What the hell is that?”\n“It’s a person,” Marasi said. The masked one turned toward MeLaan, and\nthe new angle lit the holes in its mask, illuminating human eyes with brown\nirises.\nMarasi stepped forward. “Who are you?”\nThe person turned back to her and said something completely\nunintelligible. Then it paused, and said, “Please?” That was a man’s voice."

The top shelf was cluttered\nwith objects, including the little Allomantic grenade. Prominent among them\nwas also a length of silvery metal. Kandra spikes, as proven in the Bleeder\ncase, were smaller than Marasi might have once imagined—less than three\ninches long, and slender, not at all like the spikes in Death’s eyes.\nShe knelt beside the safe, taking it out.\n“We have it,” Marasi said, turning toward MeLaan. “Do you want to carry\nit?”\nMeLaan shook her head. “We don’t touch one another’s spikes.”\nMarasi frowned, remembering the stories. “Didn’t the Guardian—”\n“Yes.”\nMeLaan’s face remained impassive, but her tone was stern. Marasi\nshrugged, tucking the spike into her purse, then searched in the safe. She left\nthe banknotes—stupid, she knew, but it felt more like really robbing to take\nthose—and took back the little cube that stored Allomantic charges.\nBeside it were several other small relics—each was coinlike, with cloth\nbands attached to the sides. They too bore the strange inscriptions in an\nunknown language. Marasi picked one up, then looked over MeLaan’s\nshoulder into the other room, where the man in the mask slumped against his\nbars.\nMarasi tucked the disc in her purse, then reached farther into the safe,\ntaking out something she’d noticed earlier. A small set of keys. She stood up\nand strode through the room.\n“Marasi?” MeLaan asked, sounding skeptical. “It might have some kind\nof disease.”\n“He’s not an it,” Marasi said, stepping up to the cage.\nThe figure twisted to regard her.\nHand quivering only a little, she unlocked the cage, getting the right key\non the second try. As soon as the lock clicked, the figure lunged for the cage\ndoor, throwing it open. Outside, he stumbled—he obviously hadn’t been\nallowed to stand up straight for some time.\nMarasi backed away until she was beside MeLaan. The tall kandra woman\nwatched with a skeptical expression, arms folded, as the masked figure\nstaggered up against the boxes, holding to them. He panted, then lurched\naway from the boxes toward the back of the room. There was a door there\nthat Marasi hadn’t noticed in the gloom, and the man frantically shoved it\nopen, stepping into the next room. Lights flicked on as the man found a\nswitch within.\n“If he alerts the guards, I’m blaming you,” MeLaan said, joining Marasi\nas they walked after the man. “I would hate to have to tell Wax that…”\nMeLaan trailed off as they reached the next room over."

On the wall hung a\ndozen wooden masks like the one the man wore.\nHe had fallen to his knees before them, looking up. Dried blood stained\nthe wall where it had dripped from a few of the masks.\nMarasi raised her hand to her mouth, taking in the gruesome scene. There\nwere no bodies, but the blood bespoke a massacre. The man she’d rescued\nlifted his mask with a trembling hand, tipping it back so it rested on the top\nof his head, exposing his face. A young face, much younger than she’d\nimagined. A youth not yet twenty, she guessed, with a short, wispy beard and\nmustache. He stared up at those masks, unblinking, hands spread to the sides\nin disbelief.\nMarasi stepped forward, moving to lift the hem of her skirt so as not to\nbrush that bloody ground—before remembering she had on trousers.\nAs she reached the youth, he turned to her.\n“Please,” he whispered, tears in his eyes.\n* * *\nWax stepped into the room.\nTelsin sat twirling a pencil in her hand. There was a speaking box before\nher on the table, but making no sound. She turned lazily to see who had\nentered, then froze in place, gaping.\nHe closed the door quietly, aluminum gun in his other hand. He started to\nspeak, but Telsin leaped from her chair and threw herself into his arms. Head\nagainst his chest, she started weeping softly.\n“Rusts,” he said, holding her, feeling awkward. “What did they do to you,\nTelsin?” He wasn’t certain what he’d expected from their reunion, but this\nhadn’t been it. He didn’t think he’d ever seen her cry. He certainly couldn’t\nremember it.\nShe shook her head, pulling back, sniffling and setting her jaw. She\nlooked … old. Not that she was ancient, but he remembered her as a youth,\nnot a middle-aged woman.\nStupid though it sounded, he hadn’t expected age to come for Telsin. She\nhad always seemed invincible.\n“No other ways out of this room?” Wax asked, glancing about.\n“No,” she said. “Do you have another weapon?”\nHe pulled out one of his Sterrions and handed it to her. “Do you know\nhow to use it?”\n“I’m a fast learner,” she said, looking far more comfortable now that she\nhad a gun in hand.\n“Telsin,” Wax said. “Is he here? Our uncle?”\n“No. I was just speaking with him through that device. He likes … he\nlikes to check in on me. I have to tell him how wonderful I think my\naccommodations are.

It’s from somewhere else, someplace distant and\nalien. It probably wrecked near our coast, and the Set brought it here to be\nstudied.”\nMeLaan cocked her head. “Harmony does say odd things sometimes,\nabout other peoples, not from the Basin—” She blinked, focusing on the man\nkneeling on the bloody floor. “Wow. Wow.”\nMarasi nodded. Proof that there was life past the Roughs, and the deserts\nbeyond. She couldn’t let him stay here, particularly not with the Set.\n“Bring him then,” MeLaan said, moving out of the room. “And let’s get\nback to the meeting point.”\nMarasi gestured toward the way out, trying to usher the masked man\nalong. He just knelt there on the bloody floor, looking up at those hollow\nmasks on the wall.\nThen, with a trembling finger, he reached up and slid his mask back down\nover his face. He stood and pulled his blankets tight, shambling after Marasi\nas she crossed the room with the cages and entered the study.\nMeLaan was already out in the hallway beyond. Marasi fetched her rifle\nand moved to join the kandra. Rusts, what was Waxillium going to say when\nhe found out she’d picked up a stray? She could almost hear his voice. You\nfreed him, Marasi, but for all he knows you’re a member of the same group\nwho apparently killed his friends.

The\nmasked man might be dangerous.\nHe had stopped inside the room with the safe, looking about, seeming\ndazed.

The\nman yanked up one sleeve, exposing his arm, and strapped on the disc by its\ncloth ties. He let out a relieved sigh.\nLooking toward her again, he seemed more confident now.

On one hand, he couldn’t blame her. On the other hand, this was\ngoing to be rusting inconvenient. He downed the metal vial, then peeked out\nof the doorway to see the engineers and carpenters scattering for cover as\nguards came running toward Wax’s position. A few were very near, the ones\nWayne had led away, and one pointed at him and shouted.\nThe room’s flimsy walls seemed like they’d be about as effective against\nbullets as stern words were against the town drunk. As the first soldier took a\nshot at him—Wax shoved back with a Steelpush—he made a decision.\n“Hang on to me,” he said, pulling Telsin to his side. He took one step out\nof the room, fired into the ground, and sent them on a Push up into the air.\nSoldiers pointed, leveling guns, but in a moment he was on the top of the\nlarge ship. As he’d seen earlier, it was wide and flat up here, though the\nplanks were smoother than the deck of any ship he’d seen, and the gunwales\nwere like the crenellated tops of a fort or old tower.\nHe dropped Telsin. “I’ll be back soon,” he promised, leaping over the side"

The man who had shot at him earlier wasn’t giving up, and fired\nmore rounds. Splinters popped off the sides of the ship as Wax fired\nVindication and dropped the man. Wax landed, bounced off a stray nail, then\nskidded to a stop beside a stack of boxes where Wayne was hiding.\n“What?” Wayne asked. “Get impatient?”\n“My sister shot one of them.”\n“Nice.”\nWax shook his head. Soldiers had started to pour into both ends of the\nlarge structure. “Not nice. There will be kill squads mixed among those\nsoldiers, Wayne. Aluminum bullets. We need to get Marasi and MeLaan and\ngo. Fast.”\nWayne nodded. Wax took another draught of steel flakes, in case he lost\nhis gunbelt, then nodded. “Speed us to the other side.”\nWayne ran out, and Wax followed. Gunfire sounded, but Wayne popped\nup a speed bubble. It only covered about ten feet, but that was plenty to\nthrow off aim. Wayne let Wax pass him, then they charged through the edge,\nside by side. The bubble collapsed, and bullets zipped through the air back\nwhere they’d been.\nThey ran on, but about the time the soldiers got another bead on them,\nWayne created another bubble. This lurched them forward again, and shortly\nthey were able to dive behind the broken section of the ship’s pontoon and\ntake cover. Soldiers cried out, confused by the Allomancy—but if there were\nkill squads among them, trained hazekiller hit men, they wouldn’t be so\neasily fooled.\nWax led the way, darting along the front of the ship, in its shadow. As\nsoon as someone started firing, Wayne tossed up another bubble, and the two\nof them repositioned. Wayne made to run out, but Wax stopped him, arm on\nshoulder.\n“Wait.”\nSafely inside this speed bubble, Wax looked back across the cavernous\nhall. They were close to the eastern side, and soldiers in slow motion set up a\nperimeter, clogging the doorway and kneeling in ranks. Captains at the rear\nyelled, pointing, and bullets flew toward the last spot where Wayne and Wax\nhad been seen.\nUncomfortably, more shots streaked through the air where—if they’d been\nfollowing their previous pattern—they would have exited the speed bubble.\n“Damn,” Wayne said, eyeing the bullets. He tossed over his canteen. Wax\ntook a drink, judging distances and feeling the surreal sensation of standing\ncalmly in a maelstrom of gunfire, sipping apple juice.\n“They’re goin’ all-out,” Wayne said.\n“Our reputation precedes us. How much time have you got left?”\n“Two minutes, maybe. I’ve got more bendalloy on the horse, in case. The\nkandra stocked me up before we left.”\nWax grunted. Two minutes could go very quickly. He pointed at the large\nhole in the ship’s side, where a plank ramp led to the thing’s insides. “I saw\nthe ladies go in there.”\n“Funny,” Wayne said, “’Cuz I see them peekin’ out over there.”"

Wax took\na deep breath. “All right. Those armies will cut us apart, Allomancy or no, if\nwe don’t hide quickly. Those rooms will do. We can move through them\ntoward the outer wall of the building, I can break through it, and we flee into\nthe night that direction.”\n“Right,” Wayne said. “And your sister?”\n“She should be safe for the moment,” Wax said. “Once we break out, I’ll\nlaunch myself to the roof, then come back down through the open part and\ngrab her.”\n“Sounds good,” Wayne said, “’cept for one thing.”\nWax handed back the canteen. “Here.”\n“Ha!” Wayne said, taking it. “But I was talkin’ about that.” He pointed\ntoward the ship. A figure was climbing down one of the rope ladders that\nhung over the side of the ship. Telsin had not stayed put.\n“Rust and Ruin,” Wax snapped.\n“Under a minute left, mate.”\n“Get her inside a bubble!” Wax shouted, gesturing. “I’ll join the other two.\nGo!”\nThey split, the speed bubble falling. A sudden storm of gunfire assaulted\nWax’s ears as he dropped to the ground, feet forward, and Pushed against the\nmetal supports in the ship behind him. He skidded across the packed dirt of\nthe floor, bullets flying overhead, and reached the door that MeLaan flung\nopen for him. His heels hit the threshold—the corridor had a wooden floor—\nand he popped up onto his feet, landing inside with a dusty thump.\n“I’ll have you know,” Marasi said, “that we managed to do our job\nwithout alerting anyone.”\n“I’ll send you a plaque,” Wax said, pointing toward a strange, short man\nstanding behind her. “What the hell is that?”\nThe man pointed back.\n“His people must have built the ship,” Marasi said. “They had him caged\nin there, Waxillium.”\n“Damn,” MeLaan said from the doorway. “That army isn’t playing\ngames.” It was hard to hear her over the gunfire.\n“I found my sister,” Wax said. “Suit’s people must know how angry that\nwill make him. We need to—”\n“Wax!” MeLaan said, pointing.\nHe squeezed back up beside her. Wayne had almost reached his sister,\nwho pressed herself against the ship’s side, eyes frantic. But Wayne had been\nhit. He lurched in place, holding his shoulder, as another bullet hit him right\nin the neck. He fell in a spray of blood.\nWayne could heal from that, with his new, strange metalmind.\nUnfortunately, the soldiers didn’t stop firing. Another bullet hit Wayne’s side\nas he dropped and played dead, then another. In an eyeblink he was healed\nand up, but then another round dropped him.\nThey were prepared. They knew.

Knock\nhim down and keep shooting.\nSeeing his friend bleeding, facing some fifty men on his own, awakened\nsomething primal in Wax. He didn’t think; he didn’t shout orders. He tore\nfrom the hallway in a furious Push on the nails in the walls, soaring out into\nthe warehouse proper a foot or so above the ground, pulling up dust in his\nwake.\nThe soldiers had been waiting for this. They had formed up on both sides\nof the warehouse, using boxes as cover, and they sent out twin waves of\nbullets—completely uncaring that they risked catching one another in the\ncrossfire. Killing an Allomancer was worth the danger.\nThey could only wish to be so lucky.\nTo Wax’s eyes, the room became a frantic network of blue lines, a loom\nfull of a mad weaver’s threads. He shouted, Pushing to both sides, shoving\nsprays of bullets in either direction and creating a ballooning hub of open\nspace.\nSeveral bullets continued to fly, though he noticed them only because one\nclipped him on the shoulder. Wax spun and yanked Vindication from her\nholster. A second volley came, and—his mind instantly matching blue lines\nwith bullets fired—he shot once, dropping one of the men among the ranks\nwho had fired an aluminum bullet.\nMore bullets came in a storm, but Wax swept them aside like dishes off a\ntable. He was at the mercy of anyone firing aluminum, so he kept moving,\ndashing across the floor and leaping, Pushing behind himself and severely\nreducing his weight once he’d finished Pushing. The result was immediate;\nhe sped up like an arrow, flying through the air with a roar of wind in his\nears.\nHe landed before Wayne in a skid and Pushed bullets away from the\nhealing man with a roar, then increased his weight and Pushed on the hull of\nthe ship nearby. The wood crumpled, nails popping free of joints and planks\ntearing away before his fury, creating a second hole.\n“Inside!” he shouted at his sister, prone on the ground nearby.\nShe nodded, scurrying in, and Wayne—still bleeding from a dozen\ndifferent places—joined her in a crawl, throwing himself in through the\nopening.\nCan’t let them stay there, Wax thought, Pushing himself away as another\nround of bullets pelted the area. One didn’t deflect when he Pushed it, but he\ncouldn’t pick out the owner from among the dozens of firing men. Damn.\nThe ship was a death trap. Yes, it would provide cover, but if they took\nrefuge there the troops would surround them. But Wayne needed a moment\nto heal. That meant keeping the soldiers—\nThree men in jet-black suits launched in succession over the hunkered-\ndown soldiers. The guns they bore had no Allomantic metal trails. Wax\ncursed, dropping Vindication and ripping the shotgun from its holster on his\nleg.\nThe first of the Allomancers to land Pushed on Wax.

But the\nhuge powder load of the gun—designed to bring down Thugs—sent the man\nsprawling backward from his own Push. Dazed, he was just able to glance\nup as the next slug hit him in the face.\nThanks, Ranette.\nThe other two Allomancers ducked down as they landed, expecting more\nfire, but the powerful shotgun held only two rounds. Wax dropped it into its\nholster as he knelt, grabbing Vindication.\nBehind! If there was a kill squad from one direction, they’d likely send\nanother for him the other way too. The regular soldiers were mostly a\ndistraction.\nHe twisted, Pushing around himself and leveling Vindication to surprise a\nman and woman in suits sneaking up on him. He dropped the woman.\nThe male Allomancer opened fire. Too many shots. No metal lines. Wax—\nThe bullets froze in the air.\nWax blinked, and then noticed something that had fallen to the ground\nnear the enemy Allomancer: a small metal cube. Marasi crouched inside the\ndoorway where she’d been hiding, MeLaan standing over her and drawing\nfire—absorbing bullets with her flesh like it was no big deal.\nWax grinned, then stepped aside. The Allomantic grenade ran out a second\nlater, and the man who had been trapped inside the bubble fired again, trying\nto kill a Wax who was no longer there.\nWax leveled his own gun and killed the fellow.\n* * *\nMarasi wished she knew where her earplugs had gotten to. Honestly, how\ndid Waxillium survive without them? The man had to be half deaf by now.\nA bullet popped up dust on the ground near her. MeLaan knelt beside\nMarasi, giving her cover from one direction and taking another series of hits.\nShe grunted. “This doesn’t hurt,” she said. “But it’s not particularly pleasant\neither.”\nAhead, Waxillium dodged shots from two more members of the kill squad\nand scooped up the device. Marasi leveled her rifle, trying to concentrate.\nEveryone was moving so quickly, and the bullets. They zipped in the air all\naround her. She brought down several soldiers, trying to focus on the ones\nthat were firing in her direction. Many had taken shelter behind boxes on\neither side, so they weren’t firing in coordinated volleys anymore. They\nseemed to know that their job was to make a lot of noise and try to distract\nWax while others, better equipped and better trained, actually tried to take\nhim down.\nStill, it was remarkable he didn’t get hit. Waxillium dashed past, mistcoat\ntassels flying, and swept bullets from the air. Then he launched himself\ntoward the catwalks above.\nTwo men in suits followed. Allomancers. Marasi took aim at one and\nfired, but her shot was deflected.\nSpeaking of which … Though gunfire still popped in the huge room, no\nbullets hit the ground near Marasi, and none seemed to be striking MeLaan.\nBut why?

She could feel the device\nPushing on her gun, but it was far enough away that it didn’t matter.\nA hand fell on her shoulder. She jumped, then found the small masked\nman behind her. Rusts! She’d almost forgotten about him. His other hand\nwas frozen halfway toward his mask, and behind it his eyes were wide.\nShe followed his gaze, which was focused on Waxillium, who landed\nbeyond them. He must have increased his weight manyfold, for he was able\nto Push a group of boxes by their nails and send them flying backward, along\nwith many soldiers.\n“Fotenstall,” he whispered in awe.\n“Allomancer,” Marasi said with a nod.\n“Hanner konge?”\n“I have no idea what that means,” Marasi said. “But that cube thing will\nsoon stop buzzing, so we need to move. MeLaan? Do we retreat back?”\n“Please,” the masked man said, gesturing toward the ship. He pointed\nfrantically. “Please!”\nMarasi ignored him, scrambling across the ground—entering the\nwarehouse proper—and grabbing the device. It had indeed stopped buzzing.\nWaxillium landed nearby, sweeping a round of shots away from her, and\nMarasi charged the thing in her hand. It seemed like last time … yes, by\nburning just a tad of her cadmium she was able to get it buzzing, yet not\nslow herself down too much. She somehow poured the power into the device\nand tossed it at the people who landed nearby, chasing Waxillium.\nIt froze them in place.\n“Nice work so far,” Waxillium said. “But we’re going to have to split up.\nGet back into those hallways. I’ll follow soon. You’re too exposed out here!”\nThe men lurched out of her speed bubble. Waxillium started firing at\nthem, but they ducked, and one grabbed the little cube.\nMarasi brought him down with the aluminum bullet she’d chambered.\nWaxillium grinned. “Go!” he said, charging the other man, who yelped\nand leaped into the air, Pushing himself away. Waxillium scooped up the\nlittle cube as he passed, then he too launched into the air.\n“Come on,” MeLaan said, grabbing Marasi by the shoulder. A bullet took\nthe kandra in the face, ripping off a chunk of her cheek and exposing green\ncrystalline bone underneath.\nThe masked man cried out in fear, pointing and mumbling in his language.\n“You should see me in the mornings,” MeLaan said. She gestured back\ntoward the hallways. Marasi moved to follow.\nThe masked man pulled on her arm, pointing more frantically at the ship.\n“Please, please, please.”\nMarasi hesitated. A bad idea in the middle of a firefight. Fortunately, most\neveryone seemed to be concentrating on Waxillium.\nSomething bit her in the left side.

I’m going into shock.\nOh, hell.\n* * *\nWax soared high above the floor of the warehouse, zipping past the catwalks,\nwhere several gunmen with rifles had set up. He flipped Ranette’s ball device\noutward—catching it around the railing of the catwalk—and hung on tight,\npivoting sharply in the air. The gunmen started, trying to draw a bead on him\nas he landed behind them.\nHe stepped back and Pushed one gunman out at just the right moment,\nshoving him into the air as the last of the kill-squad Allomancers shot up past\nthe catwalks, bearing a stunned expression at Wax’s sudden change of\ndirection. He collided with the rifleman in midair, and Wax turned, Pushing\nthe other rifleman away. The poor man screamed as he fell.\nFarther down the catwalk, two more men had set up with crossbows and\nwooden shields. Lovely.\nWax increased his weight. The entire catwalk shattered as he crashed\ndownward through the wood, destroying the supports. He Pushed himself off\na falling bar, shooting back out into the air, spinning Ranette’s ball device on\nits cord. Above him, the suited man shook off the frantic gunman, dropping\nhim and Pushing off to send himself into the air.\nWax flipped Ranette’s ball upward and let go of the cord, still falling\nbackward. The confused Allomancer caught the device by the cord as it\npassed.\nWax shot him in the chest.\nShouldn’t drop your Allomantic shield, Wax thought, twisting in the air as\nhe fell. Even to catch a neat toy.\nAs he approached the ground, Wax slowed himself on a spent bullet, then\nlanded with a flare of mistcoat tassels. The dead Allomancer thumped to the\nground beside him.\nThe ball dropped from his fingers and rolled toward Wax. “Thanks,” Wax\nsaid, scooping it up. Where was—\nMarasi. Down and bleeding, being dragged into the ship. Damn! Wax\ngrowled, launching himself into the air again as more soldiers fired. This\nplace was a mess. Too many soldiers, many of whom were advancing on the\nship, hiding a group of men with modern crossbows behind them. As one got\nclose to the ship, Wayne peeked out.\n“Wayne!” Wax shouted, passing overhead.

Of course he’d throw it.\nWayne followed by jumping among the approaching soldiers,\nenergetically laying about with his dueling canes. A bullet came startlingly\nclose to Wax. More aluminum?

That\ntossed people away from him in a blast.\nWhen the bodies fell, three men stood, stupefied, holding guns Wax\ncouldn’t sense.\nHe brought them down with a Sterrion—his other guns were out of bullets\n—then turned as he heard something distant. Horns blaring, a command. He\nleaped to the side, enough men dead or dropped that he could get a clear\nview out one of the doors into the night.\nMen were streaming out of the buildings in the village. Dozens. He had a\nsinking feeling of dread. How long until his metals gave out? How many\ncould he fight until someone with a crossbow or an aluminum bullet got\nlucky and hit him? He roared, launching himself upward in a leap over the\nfallen men he’d Pushed. Many were climbing to their feet. He was one man,\nnot an army. He needed to run.\n“Back!” he shouted at Wayne, who already had a crossbow bolt sticking\nfrom his thigh. The shorter man joined him, running toward cover inside the\nwrecked ship.\n* * *\nMarasi squeezed her eyes shut against the pain. It had finally come, arriving\nwith a vengeance. MeLaan had given her a painkiller to chew, but it hadn’t\ndone anything yet.\n“Dieten,” the masked man said, putting her hand on her wound, which\nhe’d bound with a strip of cloth from his shirt. She cracked an eye and saw\nhim nod encouragingly, though with the mask down over his face she could\nsee only his eyes.\nWell, she wasn’t dead. Even if rusts it hurt. And she thought she\nremembered reading somewhere that getting shot in the stomach—even on\nthe side—wasn’t good.\nDon’t think about that. What was going on? She gritted her teeth, shoved\ndown her panic at being wounded, and tried to assess their situation. MeLaan\nwatched the battlefield from beside the hole in the ship. Waxillium’s sister\nstood nearby, cradling a handgun, eyes intense. Outside, gunfire, grunts, and\nscreams accompanied Waxillium and Wayne doing what they did best:\ncreating havoc.\nApparently the havoc quota had been filled, for a few moments later\nWaxillium swooped in through the hole.

Speaking of which, how exactly are we going to get away?”\nWaxillium didn’t respond immediately. He looked exhausted. He glanced\nup at his sister, who was still muttering and holding her pistol. Outside the\nship, it had gone unnervingly quiet.\n“Our best bet is still going out through one of the warehouse’s walls,”\nWaxillium said. “We’re going to have to push toward those rooms Marasi\nand MeLaan were in.”\n“That’s gonna be dangerous, Wax,” Wayne said, stumbling to his feet, still\nignoring the bolt in his thigh. “They’ll have formed up, knowing we’re going\nto try to make a break for it.”\n“We can manage,” Waxillium said. “With me Pushing, we get to those\nrooms, find an outer wall, then break through.”\n“And if they’re waiting on the other side?” MeLaan asked.\n“Hopefully they won’t be. It—”\n“Guys,” Wayne said. “I don’t think we have time to plan!”\nGunfire sounded outside again, and bullets started snapping against the\nhull. Wayne scrambled away from the opening.

Everyone get ready on my\nmark. Wayne, did you happen to grab that grenade?”\n“Yup.”\n“We’ll use it to make a speed bubble at the halfway point,” Waxillium\nsaid.\n“No luck there,” Wayne said. “Completely outta bendalloy.”\n“Damn,” Waxillium said. “Then we…” He trailed off. “Marasi? Where are\nyou going?”\nShe continued limping along with the masked man. “He wants to show us\nsomething,” Marasi said.\n“They’re coming!” Wayne shouted, peeking around the corner. “Fast!”"

She heard Waxillium curse, then gunfire sounded in the hallway.\nWaxillium was firing on men trying to pile in through the hole after them.\nTrapped in here, Marasi thought.\nThe masked man let go of her suddenly, then scrambled up the hallway\nahead. “Don’t—” Marasi said, but he stopped, threw open a panel in the\nwall, then reached in and pulled something.\nA section of the ceiling, painted with one of the strange golden patterns,\nfell open. A rope ladder dropped down, hanging only halfway to the floor.\nThe masked man jumped up and grabbed it.\n“There’s a hidden room here!” Marasi called.\n“Better than nothing,” Waxillium called back. “Everyone up!”\nWayne went next, jumping up and catching the ladder and climbing it with\na lithe step. MeLaan could touch it without needing to jump, and she hoisted\nherself next. Waxillium’s sister barely managed to grab the thing, but she\nclimbed up with a hand from MeLaan.\nMarasi stood looking with despair at the ladder, trying to imagine\nclimbing it with her pain, until Waxillium seized her around the waist and\nPushed them both up in a spinning leap. They landed inside the trapdoor,\nfinding themselves in a narrow, low-ceilinged room fitted with a few chairs\nthat were bolted to the floor. A single small window to the left looked out of\nthe hull, letting in a sliver of light. The place looked like a railway\ncompartment.\n“Great,” Wayne said. “At least now we can die in relaxed positions.”\nThe masked man was fiddling with something near the wall. Some kind of\ntrunk? He got it open and pulled out another one of those small, coinlike\nmedallions with the straps on the sides. He pulled off the one he was\nwearing, and immediately gave a visible shiver, then slapped this one on\ninstead.\n“How’s that?” he asked, looking back at them.\nMarasi blinked in shock. He’d said it in her language—strangely accented,\ntrue, but intelligible.\n“No?” the man asked. “You’re looking at me confused, still. These things\nnever work right. She swore that—”\n“No, it works!” Marasi said. “At least, I can understand you.” She looked\nto the others, who nodded.\n“Aha!” the man said. “Great, great.

It\nclicked closed, leaving them in even greater gloom. A gunshot sounded\nbelow, then another. Marasi jumped as the bullets hammered against the\nfloor of the room.\n“Does this place have any other exits?” Waxillium asked.\nThe masked man yanked on something, and the room shook with a jolt.\n“Nope,” he said.\n“Then why did you lead us here?” Waxillium demanded, grabbing him by\nthe arm.\nThe masked man looked back at him. “Medallions on, yah?”\nMore bullets pelted the floor, but didn’t penetrate into the room,\nfortunately.\n“What do they do?” MeLaan asked.\n“Make you lighter,” the masked man said.\nAs soon as he said it—as soon as she knew what it did—something inside\nof Marasi understood. She was holding metal that, somehow, she could feel.\nIt wanted something from her, and she poured it in, filling the metal … the\nmetalmind.\nShe grew lighter, rising on her seat, the force of her body pushing less on\nher backside. Telsin gasped, obviously experiencing a similar sensation.\n“Now that,” Wayne said, “that’s right strange.”\n“Great Metallic One,” the masked man said, glancing at Waxillium, “I, of\ncourse, wouldn’t dare give orders to one of your stature, even if you wear\nyour bare face out at all times. Who am I to judge? Even if you look equally\ncrass as these others—even the cute one—I’m sure you’re not. But, if I may\nbe so bold as to suggest—”\n“What?” Waxillium asked.\n“A little Push,” the masked man said, pointing downward. “On my mark.”\n“If I Push downward,” Waxillium said, “I’ll just fly up and hit the\nceiling.” He hesitated as the masked man pointed to a pair of straps\nconnected to the floor, with wooden handholds at the ends. Waxillium looked\nat them, then looked at the masked man, who nodded eagerly.\nEven in the darkness, Marasi could see the curiosity on Waxillium’s face.\nDespite the men shouting below, the muffled sound of gunshots, he was still\nthe lawman—the detective. Questions teased him. He stepped over to the\nstraps, picked them up, and held them firmly, bracing himself with his feet\non the floor.\n“Ready,” he said.\n“A moment,” the masked man said, reaching for a lever. He yanked it\nhard, and the entire room shook, then slid sideways. Out of the hull, like a\ndrawer in a dresser being opened. Marasi could see out of the front end now,\nwhich proved to have a large glass window that had been blocked by wood\nearlier.\n“Go!” the man said.\nWaxillium must have Pushed, for the room shook, then rose into the air.\nThey weren’t in a room at all, but in a small boat that could detach from the\nmain vessel.\n21\nWax stood in the center of the small vessel, Pushing against some kind of"

        "text": "They weren’t in a room at all, but in a small boat that could detach from the\nmain vessel.\n21\nWax stood in the center of the small vessel, Pushing against some kind of\nplate down below, designed—obviously—for this very purpose. It would be\nattached to the shelf the vessel had been on—not something that rose with it,\nbut some kind of launchpad for an Allomancer to use as an anchor.\nThis vessel, though tiny, should still have been too heavy to lift. He should\nhave broken those straps he held to, or been crushed by the force of his own\nPush. Yet he managed it. He held to those straps—essentially hitching\nhimself to the ship—and lifted it, with all the people inside, off a ledge that\nhad extended from the mother vessel.\nIt’s those medallions, he realized. They allow everyone to do as I do—to\nmake themselves light, nearly as light as air. That meant he was really only\nlifting the ship itself, along with their equipment.\nThe vehicle was small—barely six feet wide, though it was maybe twice\nas long—and had wide openings like doorways on either side. Those had\nfaced walls inside the pocketlike shelf they’d popped out of, but now they\nexposed the air.\nAll in all, the thing felt like the cab of a motorcar with the doors ripped\noff. As the craft rose, small pontoons on extended arms folded down and\nclicked into place. Wax had a brief view of surprised soldiers on the portion\nof the catwalk he hadn’t broken, and then they were out, rising through the\nopening in the warehouse roof.\nThe strange man in the red mask scrambled through the vehicle and\nleaned out one of the holes in the walls to look downward. He looked\nsolemn as he saluted the ship below, then bowed his head, whispering\nsomething.\nFinally, he turned to Wax. “You are doing great, O Divine One!”\n“I’m not going to be able to Push it much higher,” Wax said with a grunt.\n“The anchor is too far away.”\n“You shouldn’t need to,” the man said, scrambling past Marasi—he patted\nher on the shoulder—then fiddling with some controls at the front of the\nmachine. “I’ll need the primer cube, please,” he said, holding out a hand to\nWayne.\n“Huh?” Wayne said, looking away from where he’d been hanging out the\nother door to look down. A few distant gunshots sounded as soldiers took\npotshots at the hovering vehicle. “Oh, this?” Wayne took out the Allomantic\ngrenade.\n“Yah,” the man said, snatching it. “Thanks!” He spun and pressed it\nagainst Wax’s arm until—as he was still burning steel to keep them afloat—\nit started buzzing.\nThe little man turned and snapped the cube into place under the shelf at\nthe front of the ship. The machine shook, and then something started\nthumping underneath them. A fan? Yes, a very large one, blowing\ndownward, powered by an unseen motor.\n“You can let go, Great Being of Metals,” the man said, looking back at\nWax. “If it suits your divine desires.”\nWax eased off on his Push. They immediately started to sink.\n“Reduce your weight!” the man cried. “I mean, if it is aligned with your"

They immediately started to sink.\n“Reduce your weight!” the man cried. “I mean, if it is aligned with your\nmagnificent will, O Metabolic One.”\n“Metabolic?” Wax asked, filling his metalmind and decreasing his weight.\nThe ship stabilized in the air.\n“Uh,” the masked man said, seating himself at the front, “well, we’re\nsupposed to use a different title each time, yah? I’ve never been very good at\nthis, Your Magnificence. Please don’t launch a coin directly into my skull.\nI’m not insolent, just stupid.” He pushed a lever forward, and smaller fans\nbegan whirring at the ends of the pontoons.\n“They’re not boats,” MeLaan whispered. “Not this one, not the big one\nbelow. They’re flying ships.”\n“Harmony’s Bands,” Marasi said. She was very pale, holding to her\nwounded stomach.\nFlying ships that ran on some kind of Allomancy. Rust and Ruin. Wax felt\nthe world seem to lurch around him. If electricity had changed life so\ndramatically, what would this do? Wax forced himself to shake out of his\nstupor and looked to the short masked man. “What’s your name?” Wax said.\n“Allik Neverfar, Tall One,” the man said.\n“Wait here a moment then, Allik.”\n“Whatever you desire, O—”\nWax jumped out of the vehicle before he could be praised—or insulted, he\ncouldn’t tell which these were—again. He got a better look at the small\nairship as he left. Yes, it looked more like a long motorcar cab than it did a\nboat, with that flat bottom. The large fan was separated from the ship by a\nshort space, allowing air intake above. The doorways on the walls didn’t\nseem to close; it was fortunate the seats had straps.\nWax dropped through the sky, afraid to Push off the small airship, but was\nable to use anchors down below to slow and direct himself toward the forests\nnorth of the camp.\nHe wanted to be quick. That ship wasn’t up so high that it would be safe if\nthey had access to cannons. He dropped into the forest and surprised Steris,\nwho sat on her horse with the others in a line, all packed and ready to go.\n“Lord Waxillium!” she cried. “I assumed you’d be coming, and prepared\n—”\n“Great,” Wax said, walking to his horse. “Get down, and grab your pack\nand Marasi’s.”\nShe did so without objection or question, pulling off her small pack of\nessentials, then fetched that of Marasi. Wax did the same for MeLaan and\nWayne.\n“We’re leaving the horses?” Steris asked.\nHe released the horses, then grabbed Steris around the waist. “Turns out\nwe’ve found something better.” He pulled out one of his older guns, then\ndropped it—he’d need a large chunk of metal to get them high enough—and\nPushed, launching them from the forest and into the sky.\nHe’d worried about maneuvering—doing so up high wasn’t easy without\nskyscrapers to Push against. However, Allik steered the ship toward him,"

However, Allik steered the ship toward him,\nallowing him to get Steris one of the armbands, then set her into the vessel\nbefore climbing in himself. It managed to accept the new weight of the\nsupplies, though Allik had to pull a lever to keep them from sinking.\n“Seven people,” the masked man said. “And supplies. Above the weight\nWilg is supposed to carry, but she should manage. Until our metal runs out.\nThe question is, where do you want her to take us?”\n“Elendel,” Wax said, walking toward the front of the little ship.\n“Great,” Allik said. “And … where is that?”\n“North,” Wax said, pointing. The little shelf at the front of the vehicle—\nlike the dash of a motorcar—had a compass set into it. “If you head west first\nthough, and find the river, we can—”\n“No.” Telsin seized Wax by the arm. “We need to talk.”\nGunfire sounded below, followed by an echoing boom. Great. They did\nhave a cannon.\n“Just get us away from here,” Wax said to Allik as he let Telsin tow him\ntoward the back of the small ship. He passed Wayne, still hanging halfway\nout of one of the two open doorways and gawking. Marasi was on the floor,\nwith MeLaan checking her wound, while Steris had already started packing\ntheir bags into an efficient pile between two of the seats.\nThe fans whirred and the ship began to move—not quickly, but steadily—\naway from the enemy camp. Wax settled onto a bench at the back of the ship\nwith his sister. Rusts … Telsin. Finally. It had been a year and a half since\nhe’d promised to stop his uncle and free her. Now here she was, sitting\nbeside him.\nShe looked like a modern woman, with her hair in curls, wearing a stylish\ndress of contemporary fashion—thin material, hem up right below the knees,\na neckline to emphasize a long neck and delicate drooping chains. If you\ndidn’t look at her eyes, you could have assumed she was a fine lady on her\nway to a ball.\nIf you did look into her eyes, all you found was coldness.\n“Waxillium,” she said softly, “there’s a weapon of some sort to the south,\nhidden among the mountains separating the Basin from the Roughs. Uncle\nEdwarn has found it. He’s on his way there.”\n“How much do you know?” Wax asked, taking her hand. “Telsin, do you\nknow what he’s planning? Is it a revolution?”\n“He doesn’t tell me much,” she said. Her voice was so calm, so cold,\ncompared to how it had been before. Always full of passion, ever nudging\nhim to do things he should not. It seemed like they’d leeched the life out of\nher, during her months of captivity. “We have dinner together most nights\nwhen he is here, but he grows angry if I ask about his work. He wanted me\nfor one of his … his projects, originally, but my age makes that impossible."

To use against you, I believe.”\n“No longer,” Wax said, squeezing her hand. “No more, Telsin.”\n“And if he finds this weapon?” she asked. “He seems convinced it is there,\nand that it will give his group the power to dominate the Basin. Waxillium,\nwe can’t let him have it.” Some passion returned to her eyes, some of the\nTelsin he remembered. “If he seizes the Basin, then he will take me again.\nHe will kill you, and he will take me.”\n“We’ll get to Elendel, inform the governor, and then send an expedition.”\n“And if that takes too long?” Telsin said. “Do you know what the weapon\nis? The thing he is searching for?”\nWax looked down at the medallion strapped to her arm. “Feruchemy and\nAllomancy anyone can use.”\n“The Lord Ruler’s own power, Waxillium,” Telsin said, passionate. “The\nBands of Mourning. We could find them, use them before he does. He has to\ntravel by foot on a treacherous mountain trail. I heard them preparing for it.\nWe, however…” She looked out the doorway, toward the passing landcape.\nThis was a view few ever saw. A view once reserved only for Coinshots.\n“Let me check on Marasi,” Wax said. “Then we’ll decide.”\n* * *\nMarasi soared above the world, looking at a land bathed in starlight. Trees\nlike shrubs. Rivers like streams. Hills like little lumps. The land was\nHarmony’s garden. Was this how He saw it, with God’s perspective?\nThe Path taught he was all around, that his body was the mists—that he\nsaw all and was all. The mists were pervasive, but visible only when he\nwanted them to be. She’d always liked this teaching, as it made her feel His\nnearness. Yet other aspects of the Path bothered her. There was no structure\nto it, and because of that everyone seemed to have their own idea of how it\nshould be followed.\nSurvivorists, like Marasi herself, regarded Harmony differently. Yes, he\nwas God, but to them he was more a force than a benevolent deity. He was\nthere, but he was as likely to help a beetle as he was to help a man, for all\nwere the same to him. If you really wanted to get something done, you\nprayed to the Survivor, who had—somehow—survived even death.\nMarasi winced as MeLaan continued to work. “Hmm, yes,” MeLaan said.\n“Very interesting.”\nMarasi lay on the floor of the vehicle, near the doorway, head on a pillow\nmade from a wadded-up jacket. The wind wasn’t too bad, contrary to what\nMarasi would have expected, as they weren’t moving terribly fast—though\nthe fans did make a fair amount of noise.\nMeLaan had spread Marasi’s uniform aside in a very improper way, barely\nkeeping the most important bits covered.

Nobody seemed to care though, so\nMarasi didn’t make a fuss. Besides, that was far less disconcerting than what\nMeLaan was doing to her. The kandra woman knelt over Marasi, hand on\nher side, the flesh having liquefied and run down into the wound.\nIt was discomfortingly like what had happened when she’d picked the\nlock, as if Marasi were just another puzzle to be manipulated. Rusts, she\ncould feel MeLaan poking around in there with bits of flesh that had become\ntentacles.\n“I’m going to die, aren’t I?” Marasi asked softly.\n“Yes,” MeLaan said. Light from a small lantern from their packs\nilluminated her face. “Nothing I can do about that.”\nMarasi squeezed her eyes shut. It served her right, running about like\nsome lawman from the Roughs, scrambling through firefights and assuming\nshe was invincible.\n“How is it?” Waxillium’s voice asked. Marasi opened her eyes to see him\nleaning over, and she found herself blushing at her state of near-nudity. Of\ncourse. Her final emotion would be embarrassment because of damned\nWaxillium Ladrian.\n“Hmm?” MeLaan asked, pulling her arm out, the flesh forming back over\nher crystalline bones. “Oh. I caught a hole in the intestines, as you’d\nguessed. Sewed that up tight, using some catgut I made from some spare\nintestines I had brewing. I patched it with some of my flesh, grafted on.”\n“She’ll reject the flesh.”\n“Nah. I took a bite and replicated her skin. Her body will think it’s hers.”\n“You ate part of me?” Marasi said.\n“Wow,” Waxillium said. “That’s … wow.”\n“Yeah, well, I’m incredible,” MeLaan said. “Excuse me.” She reached her\nhand out the open side of the flying vehicle, then dropped a stream of\nsomething vile. “Had to slurp up things inside there to clean everything out.\nThe safest way.” She eyed Marasi. “You owe me.”\n“Is that the part of me you … um … ate?” Marasi asked.\n“No, just what was leaking,” MeLaan said. “That grafted patch over the\nwound should hold until you heal on your own—I melded it to your veins\nand capillaries. It’s going to get itchy, but don’t scratch it, and let me know if\nit starts to go necrotic.”\nMarasi hesitated, then prodded at her wound with exploratory fingers. She\nfound only tight flesh, like that from a scar, patching the hole. It barely hurt,\nmore a dull pain like a bruise. She sat up, amazed. “You said I was going to\ndie!”\n“Of course you’re going to die,” MeLaan said, cocking her head. “You’re\nmortal. Can’t turn you into a kandra by just— Oh, you thought today. Hell,\ngirl. That shot barely clipped you.”\n“You’re an awful person,” Marasi said. “You realize this.”"

That shot barely clipped you.”\n“You’re an awful person,” Marasi said. “You realize this.”\nMeLaan grinned, nodding to Waxillium, who offered a hand to help\nMarasi up. She quickly straightened her uniform, though MeLaan had cut it\nin ways that made modesty difficult. She’d have to dig into her pack for\nsomething new, but how would she ever change in the vehicle’s crowded\nconfines?\nShe sighed, taking Waxillium’s hand and letting him pull her to her feet.\nFor now she kept one hand at her waist, preventing her trousers from falling\noff. He offered her his mistcoat and, after a moment’s hesitation, she put it\non.\n“Thanks,” she said, noting that underneath the coat he had been wearing a\nbandage of his own, upper left arm, right below the shoulder. Had he also\nbeen shot during the fighting? He hadn’t said anything, which made her feel\neven more foolish.\nWaxillium nodded his head toward the front of the vehicle, where Allik sat\nwith his feet up on the dash, leaning back. Due to the mask, it was\nimpossible to read his expression, but she felt his posture was reflective.\n“You feel up to talking with him?” Waxillium asked.\n“I suppose,” Marasi said. “I’m a little light-headed and a lot humiliated.\nBut other than that, I’m fine.”\nWaxillium smiled, then took her arm. “You got ReLuur’s spike?”\n“Yes,” Marasi said, though she fished in her purse to make sure, to have\nher fingers on it, just in case. She held it up.\n“These degrade if they’re out of a body, don’t they?” Waxillium said,\nglancing at MeLaan, who had settled in a doorway with her legs dangling\nout, completely ignoring the perfectly good seats.\n“How do you know about that?” she asked.\n“The book Ironeyes gave me.”\n“Oh, right,” MeLaan said, her expression darkening. “That. You know, the\nLord Mistborn was wrong to create it.”\n“I’ve read it, regardless.”\nMeLaan sighed, looking out. “The longer it’s away from ReLuur, the\nmore its Blessing will weaken. But they are powerful, and can last some\ntime—besides, even if the Blessing degrades, the spike will still restore his\nmind anyway. With some … loss of memory.” Her voice caught on that last\npart, and she turned away.\n“Well, we have it thanks to you,” Waxillium said, looking at Marasi. “And\nI have my sister. So we should turn back to Elendel and find out what Allik\nknows.”\n“We should,” Marasi agreed. “But your uncle—”\n“You heard my conversation with Telsin?”\n“Enough of it.” When she hadn’t been distracted by the fear that she was\ndying. Stupid kandra.\n“And what do you think?” Waxillium asked.\n“I don’t know, Waxillium,” Marasi said. “Did we really come here for the\nspike, or even your sister?”\n“No,” he said softly. “We came to stop Suit.”"

She flipped to the page with the\nmap and held it so both she and Waxillium could see it.\nIt had a spot clearly labeled Second Site, some kind of base camp in the\nmountains. And beyond that, something high up among some other peaks,\nindicated as dangerously high. Notes from Irich said, Temple reported to be\nhere.\n“The weapon,” Waxillium said, brushing the map with his fingers. “The\nBands of Mourning.”\n“It’s real.”\n“My uncle thinks it is.” Waxillium hesitated. “And I do too.”\n“Can you imagine him as a Mistborn,” Marasi said, “and a Full\nFeruchemist? Immortal—like Miles, only far worse. Possessing the strength\nof all metals. Like the Lord Ruler come again.”\n“My uncle said he was going to the second site,” Waxillium said, studying\nthe map. “It’s possible that his expedition hasn’t gotten to the temple yet,\nthough. They know where it is, from their interrogations, but they were still\nplanning their expedition. With this machine, we could beat him there.”\nWaxillium drew in a deep breath, then nodded toward Allik up in his seat.\n“Will you talk to him? Find out what he knows.”\n“The man’s been through a lot, Waxillium,” Marasi said softly. “I think\nthey must have tortured and murdered his friends. He doesn’t deserve an\ninterrogation right now.”\n“We don’t deserve a lot of things that happen to us, Marasi. Talk to him,\nplease. I’d do it, but the way he treats me … well, I think you’ll get better\nanswers.”\nShe sighed, but nodded and climbed past Wayne, who was—\nunsurprisingly—slumped in a seat and snoring away. Steris sat with hands in\nher lap, content, as if riding in a flying machine were an everyday\noccurrence. Telsin sat in the very back.\nMarasi wobbled. Rusts, she was light-headed. Fortunately, the front of the\nvehicle had two seats, the one Allik used and a smaller stool next to him.\nAllik glanced at her, and she realized she’d been wrong about his posture.\nHe wasn’t pensive, he was cold. He sat there with arms wrapped around\nhimself, and even shivered a little.\nShe was surprised. It was colder up here than down below, true, but she\nwasn’t particularly cold herself. Then again, she was wearing Waxillium’s\ncoat now.\nAllik turned back toward the windshield as she settled down on the stool.\n“I had assumed,” he said, “that everyone up here in the land of the Sovereign\nwas a barbarian. Nobody wears masks, and what your people did to my\ncrewmates…”\nHe shivered again. This didn’t seem to be the cold.\n“But then you let me out,” he continued. “And you had one of them with\nyou, a grand Metalborn of the precious arts. So I’m left confused.”"

So I’m left confused.”\n“I don’t feel like a barbarian,” Marasi said. “But I doubt all but the most\nbarbarous of people feel like one. I’m sorry about what happened to your\nfriends. They had the misfortune of running across a group of very evil\npeople.”\n“There were fifteen masks on the wall,” Allik said. “But Brunstell’s crew\nwas nearly a hundred, yah? I know that some died in the crash, but the\nrest … do you know where they might be?” He looked to her, and she could\nsee pain in his eyes behind the mask.\n“Maybe,” Marasi said, surprised to realize she might. She turned the\nnotebook around, showing the map. “Do you know anything about this?”\nAllik stared at it. “How did you get that?”\n“I found it in the desk of one of your captors.”\n“They couldn’t communicate with us,” Allik said, taking the notebook.\n“How did they get this from us?”\nMarasi grimaced. While torture was a terribly ineffective method of\ninterrogation, at least as far as legal cases were concerned, she suspected it\nwas a powerful motivator for overcoming barriers.\n“You think they’re here,” Allik said, pointing at the map. “You think the\nmen who captured them, the evil men, brought my crewmates to find the\nSovereign’s temple.”\n“It sounds like something Suit would do,” Marasi said, glancing back at\nWaxillium, who had settled into a seat behind her and leaned forward to\nlisten. “Bring guides, or experts, just in case. He’s on his way here, the\nleader of those who killed your friends.”\n“Then that is where I must go,” Allik said, sitting up and changing the\ndirection of the ship. “Wilg and I will drop you somewhere, if you demand it,\nfor I’m not about to make that one angry.” He thumbed over his shoulder at\nWaxillium. “But I’ve got to find my crewmates.”\n“Who is the Sovereign?” Waxillium asked from behind.\nAllik winced. “Surely he was not as great as you, Remarkable One.”\nWaxillium said nothing.\n“He’s staring at me, isn’t he?” Allik asked softly of Marasi.\nShe nodded.\n“Eyes like icicles,” Allik said, “drilling into me from behind.” He spoke\nmore loudly. “The Sovereign was our king from three centuries ago. He told\nus he was your king first. And your god.”\n“The Lord Ruler?” Waxillium said. “He died.”\n“Yes,” Allik said. “He told us that too.”\n“Three hundred years ago,” Waxillium said. “Exactly?”\n“Three hundred and thirty, Persistent One.”\nWaxillium shook his head. “That’s after Harmony Ascended. Are you sure\nabout those dates?”\n“Of course I’m sure,” Allik said. “But if you wish me to revise my beliefs\nin order to—”\n“No,” Waxillium said. “Just speak the truth.”\nAllik sighed, rolling his eyes, an odd expression to see from one in a"

Anyway, the\nSovereign came about ten years after the Ice Death happened, yah? Silly\nname, but you’ve got to call it something. The land was beautiful and warm,\nand then it froze.”\nMarasi glanced toward Waxillium, frowning. He shrugged. “Froze?” she\nsaid. “I don’t recall hearing of freezing.”\n“It’s frozen right now!” Allik said, shivering. “You had it here too, you\nmust have. Over three centuries ago, the Ice Death came.”\n“The Catacendre?” Waxillium said. “Harmony remade the world. Saved\nit.”\n“Froze it,” Allik said, shaking his head. “The land was soft and warm, and\nnow it is harsh and broken and frozen.”\n“Harmony…” Marasi whispered. “Allik’s from the South, Waxillium.\nHaven’t you read the old books? The people from the Final Empire never\nwent in that direction. The oceans boiled, supposedly, if you got too close to\nthe equator.”\n“The people who lived down south adapted,” Waxillium said softly. “No\nAshmounts to fill the sky with ash, to cool it…”\n“So, the world nearly ended,” Allik continued. “And the Sovereign, he\ncame and he saved us. Taught us this.” He gestured toward the armband he\nwore, with the medallion, then paused. “Well, not this one in particular. This\none.” He reached into his desk and took out the other medallion he’d worn,\nthe one he’d taken out of the safe back in the warehouse. He put it on,\nswapping it for the language one, and sighed in contentment.\nMarasi watched him, then raised her hand as if to touch his, and he\nnodded, allowing it. His skin grew warmer even as she sat there. “Heat,” she\nsaid, glancing toward Waxillium. “This medallion stores heat. That’s a\nproperty of Feruchemy, right?”\nWaxillium nodded. “The most archetypal. In the ancient days, my Terris\nancestors dwelled in the highlands, often traveling through snow-filled\nmountain passes. The ability to store their heat, then draw upon it, allowed\nthem to survive where nobody else could.”\nAllik sat, basking in his warmth for a time, before—with obvious\nreluctance—pulling off his medallion and swapping it quickly for the one\nthat somehow allowed him to speak to them.\n“Without these,” he said, holding up the first medallion, “we’d be dead.\nGone. All five peoples extinct, yah?”\nMarasi nodded. “And he taught you this? The Sovereign?”\n“Sure did. Saved us, bless him. Taught us that the Metalborn were pieces\nof God, each one of them, though we didn’t have any of those at first. He\ngave us devices, and started the Firemothers and Firefathers, who live to fill"

He\ngave us devices, and started the Firemothers and Firefathers, who live to fill\nthese medallions so the rest of us may leave our homes and survive in this\ntoo-cold world. After he left, we used his gifts to figure out the rest, like\nthese that make us fly.”\n“The Lord Ruler,” Marasi said, “seeking redemption for what he did up\nhere by saving the people down there.”\n“He was dead,” Waxillium said. “The records—”\n“Have been wrong before,” Marasi said. “It had to be him, Waxillium.\nAnd that means the Bands…”\nWaxillium moved up beside Allik, on the other side. The masked man\neyed him, as if made very uncomfortable by his presence.\n“These,” Waxillium said, plucking the heat-giving medallion off the dash.\n“You can create these, as you wish?”\n“If we have the Metalborn to do so, and the Excisors, yes. The Excisors\nare the gifts the Sovereign made for us.”\n“So with one of those devices, a Metalborn can create a medallion like\nthis—one for any Allomantic or Feruchemical ability?”\n“Holy words,” Allik said. “But if anyone can say them, it is you, O\nBlasphemous One. Yes. Any.”\n“And did one of you create a medallion that grants all of the powers?”\nWaxillium asked.\nAllik laughed.\nMarasi frowned. “Why laugh?”\n“You think us gods?” Allik said, shaking his head. “You see that? The one\nyou hold? It is very complicated. It is stored with the ability to give yourself\na sliver of holiness.”\n“Investiture,” Waxillium said. “This inner ring is nicrosil. You tap it, and it\ngrants you Investiture—turning you into a temporary Feruchemist who has\nthe ability to fill a metalmind with weight.” He held up the medallion. “The\niron on this is for convenience, right? You can fill it, but so long as you’re\ntapping the Investiture, you could touch any source of iron and turn it into a\nmetalmind.”\n“You know much about this, Mysterious One,” Allik said. “You are wise\nand—”\n“I learn quickly,” Waxillium said, glancing at Marasi. She nodded for him\nto continue. This was fascinating … but the Metallic Arts was not one of her\nareas of expertise. Waxillium had a passion for it though. “What’s this other\nring built into the medallion?”\n“That grants the warmth,” Allik said. “It is a grand combination—two\nattributes, from separate rings. Took us long to make these work, yah? The\none I wear now, also grants two. Weight and Connection. I’ve seen\nmedallions with three. Twice in my life only. Every attempt at four has\nfailed.”\n“So wear multiple medallions,” Waxillium said. “Strap thirty-two to your\nbody, and have all the abilities.”\n“I’m sorry, great Wise One,” Allik said. “You are obviously very\nknowledgeable about this, and know things that none of us would ever think"

How could we be so foolish as to not realize that we could simply—”\n“Shut it,” Waxillium growled.\nAllik flinched.\n“Doesn’t work?” Waxillium asked.\nAllik shook his head. “They interfere with each other.”\n“So to create one with multiple powers…”\n“You must be very skilled,” Allik said. “More skilled than any who has\nlived among us. Or…” He chuckled. “Or you’d have to have all the powers,\nrather than adding yours to the medallion, then passing it to another to have\nit added to! If that were the case, you’d be a great god indeed. As powerful\nas the Sovereign.”\n“He did create one of these,” Waxillium said, rubbing the medallion with\nhis thumb. “One with all of the abilities. A bracer, or a set of them, that\ngranted all sixteen Allomantic abilities and all sixteen Feruchemical\nabilities.”\nAllik wilted.\n“That’s why you’re here, isn’t it, Allik?” Waxillium asked, looking into\nthe man’s eyes.\nMarasi leaned forward. Waxillium said he wasn’t good at reading people,\nbut he was wrong. He was great at it—so long as reading them involved\nbullying them.\n“Yes,” Allik whispered.\n“You traveled from your lands to find the Bands of Mourning,” Waxillium\nsaid. “Why are they up here?”\n“Hidden away,” Allik said. “When the Sovereign left us, he took them\nwith him, along with his priests, his closest servants. Well, some of them\neventually returned, yah? With stories to tell. He’d taken them on a great\njourney, and had them build a temple for him in a hidden range of\nmountains. He’d left the priests there, with the Bands, and told them to\nprotect them until he returned for them. And, that was dumb, yah? Because\nwe could really use those to fight the Deniers of Masks.”\n“Deniers of masks? Like us?”\n“No, no,” Allik said, laughing. “You’re just barbarians. The Deniers are\nreally dangerous.”\n“Hey,” Wayne called from behind them, hair whipping in the wind, hat\nheld in his hands. When had he woken up? “We knocked your big ship outta\nthe sky, didn’t we?”\n“You?” Allik said, laughing. “No, no. You could not have so harmed\nBrunstell. He fell to a great storm. It is a danger of our ships—so light, so\neasily troubled by storms. We would have landed Brunstell, but we were in\nthe mountains, searching. We were so close to the temple, but then … yah.\nBlown out of the mountains over your lands. Smashed into that poor village.\nThe barbarians there were nice at first. Then the others came.”\nHe shrank down in his chair.\nWaxillium patted him on the shoulder.\n“Thank you, Wonderful One,” Allik said. He heaved a sigh. “Well, ever"

He heaved a sigh. “Well, ever\nsince the Sovereign’s elite told us the stories, we’ve tried to find the\nbracers.”\n“Find them?” Waxillium said. “You told us he’d left the Bands there for\nhimself.”\n“Well, yah, but everyone interprets it as a challenge. A test sent by the\nSovereign? He was fond of those. Why would he let priests tell us about\nthem, if he didn’t want us to come claim them?\n“Only, after years of searching, everyone started thinking the temple was\nsome fancy legend, lost in time. Everyone’s uncle had a map, yah? The type\nworth less than the paper it’s written on? But then, recently, some interesting\nstories started circulating. Talk of lands up here, and of mountains nobody\nhad explored. We sent several scout vessels, and they returned with stories of\nyour people, in this land.\n“Well, five or six years back, the Hunters sent a big ship up with a quest to\nfinally find the temple. And they succeeded, we think. One skimmer came\nback with a map of where they’d been. The rest froze to death; a blizzard in\nthe mountains overwhelmed their medallions.”\nWind rocked the small ship as Allik fell silent.\n“We’re going after that temple, right?” Marasi asked, looking at\nWaxillium.\n“Damn right we are.”\n22\nMarasi had plenty of time to think as they traveled southward toward the\nmountains. Allik guessed the trip would take about two hours, which\nsurprised her. She’d imagined an airship to be a fast-moving vehicle, but this\nwas likely slower than a train. Still, being able to proceed there in a straight\nline instead of having to follow the landscape was a distinct advantage.\nEven with the fans whirring in their casings, the airship seemed to spend\nmuch of its time gliding. Allik would increase their height or lower it, trying\nto find favorable winds—and he complained that he didn’t know the\nairstreams of this area. He did his navigation using devices she didn’t\nrecognize along with some startlingly accurate maps of the lower Basin.\nHow often had these people prowled through the skies up here, hidden in the\ndarkness, observing and making their maps?\nMost of the others slept, comfortably tapping warmth as Allik had taught\nthem. When Marasi considered sleeping herself, she could not banish the\nimage of falling from one of those doorways and awakening just as she hit\nthe ground—even with the waist belts tying them all in.\nWayne gave her something else to help with the pain, though he wouldn’t\nsay what it was. It felt good though, and she could mostly ignore her aching\nside. She settled into the seat beside Allik and chatted with him. She felt\nguilty, as that required him to wear the medallion that let him translate, but\nhe seemed as eager to talk as she was. She could not say whether that was\nbecause he was starved for interaction following his incarceration, or if he\nwanted to be distracted from thinking about the friends he’d lost during his\njourney.\nOver the next two hours, he told her more about the medallions they wore,"

        "text": "wanted to be distracted from thinking about the friends he’d lost during his\njourney.\nOver the next two hours, he told her more about the medallions they wore,\nand the legends of the Bands of Mourning. In Allik’s lore, the Lord Ruler\nhad filled them with a great deal of every attribute—but had also crafted\nthem to grant any person who used them the ability to draw those forth. A\nkind of challenge to mankind to find them, along with a warning not to. Allik\ndidn’t seem to consider this a contradiction at all.\nHe also spent more time telling her about life where he was from—a place\nover the mountains, across the entire Southern Roughs and the wastelands\nbeyond. A distant, wonderful place where everyone wore masks, though not\neveryone wore them in the same way.\nAllik’s own people preferred to change masks according to their\nprofessions or moods. Not each day, certainly, but it wasn’t uncommon for\nthem to change their mask as often as a lady in Elendel might change her\nhairstyle. There were other groups though. One gave a mask to each child,\nand those only changed once, when they reached adulthood. Allik claimed\nthat these people—called Hunters—even grew into their masks somehow,\nthough Marasi found that difficult to believe. Still other people, to whom he\nreferred derisively, wore only plain, unpainted masks until they did\nsomething to earn a more ornate one.\n“They are the Fallen,” he explained to her, wagging one hand before\nhimself in a gesture she didn’t understand. “They were our kings, yah?\nBefore the world froze. They offended the Jaggenmire, which is why\neverything went wrong, and—”\n“Wait,” Marasi said, speaking softly so the others could sleep, “the …\nyayg—”\n“Jaggenmire?” he asked. “It didn’t translate? You don’t have a word for it\nin your language, then. It’s like a god, only not.”\n“Very descriptive.”\nSurprisingly he lifted his mask, something she’d only seen him do that\nonce, when he’d knelt before the masks of his friends. He didn’t seem to\nconsider it an infraction of any sort, and kept talking. She liked being able to\nsee his face, even if his wispy beard and mustache looked a little ridiculous\n—it made him look younger than he really was, unless he was lying about\nbeing twenty-two.\n“It’s like…” he said, grimacing, “like a thing that runs the world, yah?\nWhen something grows, or dies, the Jaggenmire make that happen. There is\nHerr, and his sister Frue, who is also his wife. And she makes things stop,\nand he makes things go, but neither can—”\n“—make life on their own,” Marasi said.\n“Yah!” he said.\n“Ruin and Preservation,” she said. “The old Terris gods. They’re one now.\nHarmony.”\n“No, they were always one,” Allik said. “And always apart. Very odd,\nvery complex. But anyway, we were talking about the Fallen, yah? They\nwork doing anything they can to relieve their burden of failure. A\ncompliment means a lot to them, but you have to be careful, because if you"

A\ncompliment means a lot to them, but you have to be careful, because if you\ntell them they did well, they might take your compliment to heart and travel\nback to their people to tell everyone. Then you might be called in to testify\nabout how good a job they did, so they can change their mask. And their\nlanguage, that’s a real pain. I speak a smattering of it—always useful, so you\ndon’t have to wear the medallion—and it makes my head spin as if I’d been\nflying too high for way too long.”\nShe smiled, listening to him go on, gesturing wildly as he spoke—which\nshe figured was only natural, if everyone’s faces were covered all the time.\n“Do you speak many languages?” she asked, as he took a breath, finally\npausing his narrative.\n“I don’t even speak my own that well,” he said with a grin. “But I’m\ntrying. Seems like a good skill for a skimmer pilot to have, since it’s often\nmy job to pilot Wilg and take people between ships or towers. And if I’m\ngoing to sit half the day in a class, I figure it should be something useful.\nThough mathematics has—”\n“Class?” Marasi asked, frowning.\n“Sure. What do you think we do all day on the ship?”\n“I don’t know,” Marasi said. “Swab decks? Tie ropes. Um … trim …\nstuff. Deckhand types of things.”\nHe looked at her, eyes bulging, then slapped his mask down. “I’m going\nto pretend that you did not just compare me to a common lowshipman, Miss\nMarasi.”\n“Ummm…”\n“You have to be something more special than that, if you want to fly.\nWe’re expected to be gentlemen and ladies. We’ve thrown people overboard\nfor not knowing the proper dance moves.”\n“What, really?”\n“Yah, really.” He hesitated. “All right, so we tied a rope to his foot first.”\nHe made a gesture she had started to realize was something like a smile or a\nlaugh. “He dangled there below Brunstell for a good five minutes, cursing up\na storm. He never got the cistern three-step wrong again, though! And Svel\nalways said to him…”\nAllik trailed off, growing silent.\n“And?” Marasi prodded.\n“Sorry. His mask … Svel, I mean. On the wall…”\nOh. The conversation died, Allik staring out the front of the ship, then\nmaking a few adjustments to their heading. Outside, the landscape was dark\nsave for a few pinpricks of towns, now far to their left. Though they’d\ninitially skirted the Seran Range, Allik had moved the skimmer into the\nmountains about a half hour back. Now they flew over the tops of the peaks,\nhaving ascended higher than they’d been when flying over the Basin.\n“Allik,” Marasi said, resting her hand on his arm. “I’m sorry.”\nHe didn’t respond. And so, hesitantly—fully aware that she was probably\ndoing something taboo—she reached out and lifted his mask. He didn’t stop\nher, and the motion revealed eyes staring sightlessly, a tear trickling down\neach cheek."

Hell, I’m never going to see home again, am\nI?”\n“Of course you will,” Marasi said. “You can fly there.”\n“Wilg won’t last on the stone I’ve got,” he said, wiping the tears from first\none cheek, then the other.\n“The stone?”\n“Fuel,” Allik said, glancing at her. “What, you think Wilg flies on clouds\nand dreams?”\n“I thought it flew on Allomancy.”\n“Allomancy Pushes the impellers,” Allik said. “But ettmetal is what\nsupports it.”\n“I don’t think that one translated either,” Marasi said, frowning.\n“Here, see,” Allik said, kneeling down and opening the compartment\nwhere he’d put the little cube that Waxillium called an Allomantic grenade.\nIt was attached to a metal shell, which glowed softly at the center. Allik\npointed, and to the side she could see a greater light blazing with a pure\nwhiteness. A stone, burning like a limelight.\nOr like Allomancy itself, Marasi realized. “What kind of metal is it,\nthough?”\n“Ettmetal,” Allik said, shrugging. “There’s a little bit in the primer cube\ntoo, to make it work. A lot more to make a ship like Wilg go, and a lot, lot\nmore to get Brunstell into the air. You don’t have this metal?”\n“I don’t think so,” Marasi said.\n“Well, what we have in Wilg, it’ll be enough to fly us a day or two. After\nthat, we’d need an Allomancer Pushing full-time. So unless His Greatness\nthe Drowsy One back there wants to fly with me all the way back, I’m stuck,\nyah?”\n“You said there was more on Brunstell.”\n“Yah, but they have it.” He grinned. “At first, the evil ones didn’t know\nhow to care for it. Got some wet. That was a good day.”\n“Wet?”\n“Ettmetal explodes if it gets wet.”\n“What kind of metal explodes if you put it in water?”\n“This kind,” he said. “Anyway, your evil men, they got most of ours.”\n“And we’re going to stop them,” Marasi said firmly. “We’ll get your\ncrewmates back, stick you on your ship—or some of these skimmers, if the\nbig one won’t fly anymore—and send you home.”\nHe settled back in his seat, closing the panel under the dash. “That’s what\nwe’re going to do,” he agreed, nodding. Then he eyed her, his mask still up.\n“Of course, your people don’t have what we do. No airships at all.

You have no mask to hide your emotions. So odd, but welcome in\nthis case. Still, I have to wonder if this will be more complicated than you\nsay. If we do find the relics, what you call the Bands of Mourning, who\nkeeps those? They are ours, yet I cannot see your Metalborn lord letting\nthem slip away from him.”\nAnother difficult question. “I … I honestly don’t know,” Marasi said. “But\nyou could say we have as much a claim to them as you, since it was our ruler\nwho created them.”\n“A ruler you killed,” he pointed out. “But let us not argue about it, yah?\nWe will find what we find, and then determine what to do.” He hesitated. “I\nmust tell you something, Miss Marasi. It is possible we will find nothing at\nthe temple but destruction.”\nShe frowned, settling on her seat, wishing he still had the mask up so she\ncould read his face. “What do you mean?”\n“I told you of the ones who came seeking the temple,” Allik said.\n“The Hunters,” Marasi said.\nHe nodded. “They were warriors, in the time before the freezing. Now\nthey hunt answers to what happened to us, and secrets to making it never\nhappen again. Miss Marasi, I have known many, and they can be a good\npeople—but very, very stern. They believe that the Bands of Mourning were\nleft with us as a test—but opposite the one we all assume. They think the\nSovereign intended to see if we would take the power when we should not.\nAnd so…”\n“What?” Marasi asked.\n“Their ship,” he said, looking toward her, “that came up here first. It\ncarried bombs, great ones, made from the ettmetal. Intended to destroy the\nBands. They did not succeed, it is said. But anything could have happened.\nThe place of the temple is said to be frozen beyond anything else in this\nworld. A dangerous place for my kind.” He shivered visibly, then looked\nlongingly at the medallion set on the desk before him.\n“Go ahead,” Marasi said, “put it on.”\nHe nodded. They’d had to do this several times during the flight so far,\nletting Allik warm himself with the Feruchemical device. Marasi wore one\nherself, comfortably warm—though up this high, the air was probably\nfreezing.\nAllik settled back, and Marasi—curious—picked up the Connection\nmedallion that he had set down.

She let out a squeal of alarm\nand immediately donned the weight/Connection one instead, then blushed—\nmaking herself light again—as Waxillium whipped his gun out and leaped to\nhis feet. So he hadn’t been sleeping, but eavesdropping. He looked around to\nsee what had caused the lurch.\nNone of the others stirred. Wayne kept snoring.\nMarasi held up the disc to Allik, then tapped Connection. She waited for\nsome reaction inside of her, but it didn’t seem to do anything.\n“We’ve been foolish,” she said. “I could have been wearing this all along,\nand speaking your language. Then you could have been warm the entire\ntime.”\nAllik grinned at her, then said something completely unintelligible.\n“What’s going on?” Waxillium said from behind her.\n“Nothing,” Marasi said, blushing again. It wasn’t working. Why wasn’t it\nworking?\nAllik gestured to her, and she switched back to her previous medallion—\nworking very carefully this time to avoid causing a jolt, but mostly failing.\nHow did he transition between them so smoothly?\nHe made a gesture, like a hand drawn across his face, that she thought\nindicated a smile. “Clever, but it won’t work on you.”\n“Why?”\n“Because we’re in your lands,” he said. “The visitor always has to wear\nthe medallion. It’s filled with Connection, yah? Blank Connection, to no\nplace. But Connection can’t just be connected to nothing, so when you tap it,\nit reaches out and connects you to the place where you are. Makes your soul\nthink you were raised in this place instead, so your language changes.”\nMarasi frowned, though Waxillium perked up, pulling up between their\ntwo seats. “Curious,” he said. “Very curious.”\n“It is the way of the world,” Allik said with a shrug.\n“Then why do you have an accent still?” Marasi asked. “If your brain\nthinks it was raised here?”\n“Ah,” Allik said, raising his finger. “My soul thinks I was raised here, in\nyour lands, but it knows that I am Malwish by descent, and that parents are\nfrom Wiestlow, so I cannot help but have an accent, yah? I got it from them.\nIt is how the medallions always work.”\n“Strange,” Marasi repeated.\n“Yah,” Allik agreed. But Waxillium was nodding, as if it made perfect\nsense to him.\n“Those mountains to the right,” Waxillium said, pointing. “Those are\nsome taller peaks than the ones we’ve been passing.”\n“Yah!” Allik said. “Good eye, O Observan—”\n“Stop with the titles.”"

Difficult to see,\nbut distinct once Marasi noticed it. Light, hovering in the darkness—only a\nglimmer, but stark against the blackness.\n“The Seran Range is uninhabited,” Waxillium said, “except in a few of the\nvalleys. Too cold, too many storms.”\n“So if there’s a light…” Marasi said.\n“Suit has left on his expedition,” Waxillium said, standing up straight.\n“Time to wake the others.”\n23\nWayne was awakened quite rough-like, in a manner unbefitting his grand\ndreams, in which he was king of the dogs. Had a crown shaped like a bowl\nand everything. He blinked his eyes, feeling nice and warm, and got hit with\na blast of air. Drowsy, he remembered he was flying in some kind of rusting\nairship with a fellow what had no face. And that was almost as good as that\ndog thing.\n“Can you bring us down closer?” Telsin asked.\n“If I do,” the masked guy said, “they’ll hear us, even with Wilg’s fans on\nlow speed. We need to pass over those people below, but I will keep us very\nhigh.”\nRusts! Wax’s sister hung half out of the machine’s open side, looking\ndown, though Wayne could barely make her out with the light so low. He\nhadn’t figured that Telsin would be the adventurous type, what with Wax\nbeing all calm and careful most of the time. Yet there she was, doing her best\nimitation of a pub sign flapping in the wind. He nodded in appreciation, then\nuntied his little belt thing, and got up to look at what she was seeing.\nHe stepped over their packs, which had toppled from the neat stack Steris\nhad made, then leaned out next to Telsin. That let him look down at a long\nline of people—lit by lanterns—trudging through what appeared to be waist-\nhigh snow. Poor sods.\nWax stepped up to the other opening, looking down with his spyglass.\nWayne couldn’t see much, himself. He held on with one hand and took out\nhis box of gum, shaking it. Only one ball left. Damn. Well, at least it had\nplenty of powder on it. That would help perk him up, it would.\n“Do you see him?” Telsin asked.\n“I think so,” Wax said. “Wait. Yes, that’s him. I’ll bet they left on their\nexpedition the moment they got word of what happened with us at the\nwarehouse.” He reached into his holster and took out one of his guns. He\ngave the rusting things names, but Wayne could never keep them straight. It\nwas one of the ones with the long tubey thing on the front what spat bits of\nmetal at the bad guys.\n“Let me do it,” Telsin said, voice passionate."

That was quite the\nbloodthirst this woman had.\n“You can’t make a shot like this,” Wax said. “Not sure if I can either.”\n“Let me try,” Telsin begged. “I don’t care what it takes. I want him dead.\nAnother will take his place, but I want him dead.”\nWax sighted for a long moment, and everyone in the ship seemed to hold\ntheir breath. Finally, Wax lowered his gun. “No,” he said. “Your testimony in\ncourt will do more against the Set than killing a man for no reason other than\nvengeance. And I’d rather have him to interrogate anyway.” He holstered the\ngun.\nWayne nodded. Reliable chap, that Wax. Steady. The same on a good day\nand a bad. Wayne moved to retreat into the ship’s interior, but as he\nscrambled over the seats, he somehow got tangled a little with Telsin and, in\nthe process, kicked one of the packs out the opening.\nWayne stared down, aghast, as it fell and actually hit one of the men on\nthe head.\n“What did you do?” Telsin demanded.\nWayne winced.\n“What did Wayne do now?” Marasi asked, a sense of resignation in her\nvoice.\n“He kicked that pack out right on top of them,” Telsin said.\n“’S not my fault,” he said. “Wax woke me up too soon. Put me off\nbalance.” He looked back at the ship’s other occupants. Wax sighed, moving\nup beside the pilot. Steris and MeLaan sat on the back bench, out of the way\n—MeLaan lounging in a rather attractive way, Steris bent over a large\nnotebook. Taking notes? What was wrong with that woman?\nDown below, the men in the snow held their lanterns high and scanned the\nsky, seeming confused.\n“Move us away,” Wax said to the masked pilot, pointing. “Go the\ndirection they’re hiking.”\n“Yes, Decisive One,” the pilot fellow said, and the fans at the sides of the\nthing grew louder. “Hold on, everyone.”\nThe ship shifted. Not quickly, but it did start moving again. Neat trick that\nhad been, staying in place while flying. Birds couldn’t do that, just\nCoinshots. Wayne moved forward, sidling past Marasi to get a good look out\nthe front of the ship.\n“Wind is picking up,” the pilot mentioned. “Might be a storm, as if things\nweren’t cold enough already.”\n“There,” Wax said, pointing. “What was that?”\n“I’ll bring us around,” the pilot fellow said, swinging the ship, which\nrocked precariously. Another gust of wind brought flakes of snow in through\nthe openings in the ship’s walls.\n“That’s it,” Wax said, peering through the curtain of snow. “Harmony’s\nRings … it’s really here.”\n“I don’t see anything,” Wayne said, squinting.\n“Hold on to something,” the pilot fellow said. “Or make sure you’re\nstrapped in. I’m going to land.”"

I’m going to land.”\nSo Wayne grabbed the man’s arm.\n“Something else.”\nWayne grabbed the chair’s back, and good thing he did, since the ship\npitched to the side as it came down. The landing wasn’t too bad, assuming\nyou liked getting shaken about and then having your face smacked into the\nwall.\nWayne blinked, finding himself in blackness. A moment later MeLaan\nmanaged to relight her lantern and hold it up, showing that the ship had\nsettled halfway on its side, one of the fan wings—which could fold up so the\nthing could fit in the larger ship—having bent up on its hinges, with a big\nheap of snow pushed in through the hole in the ship’s side.\n“Is that how it usually goes?” Wax asked, standing up shakily on the\nsloping floor.\n“Landing is difficult,” the pilot fellow admitted.\n“Technically,” Marasi said from the back, “it’s not. It’s probably the\neasiest thing to do with a flying ship, assuming you’re not picky.”\nWayne snorted, climbing across the ship to the side that was pointed\nupward, and hopped out. The snow crunched when he dropped into it. He\nhadn’t expected that—the only snow he’d seen had been the occasional\nflurry up in the Roughs, and it never got anywhere near this deep. Why\nwould it crunch? The stuff was made of water, not cereal flakes.\nHe stumbled out of the high pile of snow onto a windswept rocky portion\nof ground. Snow pelted him like grains of sand, but it didn’t seem to be\ncoming from the sky, just getting blown in from the side. He shivered and\ntapped more warmth. The clouds happened to roll out of the way, releasing\nstarlight like a bouncer stepping back and letting folks into the night’s most\nexclusive club.\nThat light cascaded down, white and calm, upon a rusting castle in the\nmiddle of the mountains. A bleak stone fortress, cut of the same stone as the\nfield. It looked to be only one story, hunkered down against the wind, but it\nglowed in the starlight like the spirit of some ancient building from\nanteverdant days.\nWayne breathed out slowly, his breath making white mist before him.\n“Nice,” he said, nodding. “Nice.” The folks that built this, they had style.\nMarasi clambered out of the ship, wearing Wax’s mistcoat for some\nreason, and almost fell face-first in the snow. She stood on top of the white\nfluff, a gust of wind almost knocking her over again, until suddenly she sank\ndown into it farther with a crunch. She’d finally remembered to stop filling\nher weight metalmind. Easy mistake to make, if you weren’t accustomed to\nbeing a Feruchemist.\nShe pushed through the snow and joined Wayne, wiping melted snow\nfrom her brow. She looked to be doing well, considering that she’d been\nshot.\n“Suit and his people aren’t far off,” she said. “And they know we’re here,\nnow.”\n“Then we find the Bands first,” Wax said from behind them.

It was\nseriously unfair how he glided up out of the machine, then soared on a quick\njump to land next to them, no stumbling in that snow. Seriously. Why had\nHarmony made the stuff? Didn’t seem to serve much of a purpose.\n“Everyone grab your things. Allik, remove the grenade from the ship, just in\ncase.”\nThey all hurried to obey, Marasi climbing back in the machine, then\njoining Steris in handing the packs out. Allik emerged, wearing that mask of\nhis still, and stood on the side of his ship, staring at the fortress and shaking\nhis head. He then turned and patted his ship, like it was some kind of puppy,\nuntil Steris appeared and chased him away for some reason. A few moments\nlater Marasi climbed out, wearing a dress instead of her uniform, but with\ntrousers on underneath. She tossed Wax his mistcoat.\nFigures. A woman would have to change outfits for this. Can’t infiltrate a\nremote, ancient temple without properly accessorizing. Wayne ran his hand\nthrough his hair, then had a moment of panic. His hat! He scrambled back\ntoward the ship, looking around frantically, but then spotted it peeking from\na snowdrift nearby, having fallen free as they landed. He picked it up with a\nsigh of relief.\n“Everyone back,” Wax said, steadying himself with a stable footing, the\nwind blowing his mistcoat tassels back and whipping them about. The others\nmoved away from the ship, and Wax grunted, Pushing. The ship skidded\nback softly into the snow, piling it up in a wave. Wax Pushed until the thing\nwas completely buried.\n“Nice,” Wayne said.\n“Let’s hope one of their Coinshots or a Lurcher doesn’t spot it beneath the\nsnow,” Wax said, turning toward the temple and shouldering his shotgun.\n“Come on, let’s get out of this wind.”\nThey picked up the packs and started across the stone field toward the\nfortress. Steris had found another lantern somewhere, and lit it. Wayne\nhurried his step and fell in beside that pilot fellow with the mask.\n“You know,” Wayne said, “I’m an Allomancer too.”\nThe man said nothing.\n“I figured you’d want to know,” Wayne said, “since it seems like this is\nyour religion and all. In case you wanted someone else to worship.”\nAgain no reply.\n“I’m a Slider,” Wayne said. “Speed bubbles, you know? Those fancy titles\nwould work for me just fine, I think. Handsome One. Smart One. Um …\nGuy wif the Great Hat.”\nThe only sound was that of their footfalls and the gusting wind.\n“Now, see,” Wayne said, “this is unfair. Wax doesn’t want you to worship\nhim, right? But you gotta have someone to worship. It’s human nature. It’s\ningratiated in us. So, I’m willin’ to be accommodatin’ and let you—”\n“He can’t understand you, Wayne,” Marasi said, marching past. “He’s\nswapped metalminds to keep himself warm.”"

What was that off to\nthe side? He shouldered his pack and hiked over, ignoring Marasi’s call that\nhe turn back. There was something there, near the cliffs. A hulking shape\nbigger than a house, the exposed bits covered in frost.\nWax strode over, squinting against the wind, and grunted. “Another ship,”\nhe said. “The one that the Hunters sent.”\n“The who?”\n“Group of people from Allik’s region,” Wax said. “They came here to\ndestroy the place. Fortunately, it seems they didn’t succeed.” He turned to\ngo, but Wayne nudged him, nodding toward a hand sticking from one of the\nsnowbanks. Looking more closely, he was able to pick out a dozen corpses,\nperhaps more, lying there in this icy place, frozen for all time.\nWax nodded, then they hiked back toward the others. Marasi and Steris\nhad waited, along with the masked man—who had crossed half the distance\nto the new ship, then stopped, staring at it. Telsin had strode on ahead,\nMeLaan tailing her. He quickly joined the rest of them as they followed after\nTelsin and MeLaan.\n“Your sister,” Wayne said to Wax, “is kinda…”\n“Severe?” Marasi said.\n“I was gonna say bonkers,” Wayne admitted. “Though I’m not sure if it’s\nthe good kinda bonkers or the bad kind, as of yet, as I haven’t had time to\ngive it the proper evaluatin’.”\n“She’s been through a lot,” Wax said, eyes ahead. “We’ll get her home and\ngive her some physicians to talk to. She’ll mend.”\nWayne nodded. “Course, she won’t fit in wif us anymore if she does.”\nThey continued, and that fortress, rusts it was impressive. Made of broad\nstone blocks, the type that some poor fellow probably broke his back lugging\nabout, it had steps out front leading up to an enormous statue. At first he was\nsurprised, as all the way out here seemed an odd place for a sculpture—but\nthen, the ones back in Elendel had been shat on by about a million birds, so\nperhaps this was the best place to keep your statue.\nThe group of them made their way up the steps, fighting the wind. The\nmedallion meant the wind wasn’t cold enough to chill his nethers, but it was\nstill annoying. At the top of the steps they had to walk around that statue,\nwhich was in the shape of a fellow in a long coat holding a spear to his side,\nits tip resting on the stones. Wayne scratched his face, stepping back and\ncraning his neck.\n“What’s wrong with his eye?” Wayne asked, pointing.\nMarasi stepped up beside him, squinting in the darkness. “A spike,” she\nsaid softly. “Like on that coin of Waxillium’s.”"

One spike, jutting through his right eye. Wayne rounded\nthe statue, which had snow piled about its base.\n“One spiked eye,” Wax said, thoughtful. “This place was built by the Lord\nRuler. Why would he have them make a statue of him with one eye spiked\nthrough?”\n“He carries a spear,” Marasi said. “For the one that he used to kill the\nSurvivor?”\n“A metal spear,” Wax noted. “But no lines. Aluminum. Looks like some\non his belt too. Expensive.”\nMarasi nodded. “The Lord Ruler was run through with three spears, by the\nLord Mistborn’s testimony. ‘Once stabbed by a beggar, for the poverty he\nbrought. Once stabbed by a worker, for the slavery he enforced. Last stabbed\nby a prince, for the lords he corrupted.’ The spears didn’t hurt him.”\n“Come on,” Telsin called from inside the building, where she’d been\njoined by Steris.\nWax and the masked fellow moved off, but Wayne kept looking up at the\nstatue.\n“So I’ve been thinkin’,” Wayne said as MeLaan passed him.\n“Yeah?” she asked, glancing at him.\nRusts. Wax might think it weird, considering she was like a billion years\nold or something, but it seemed like even longer since a woman had looked\nat him like that. It wasn’t a lusty look or anything like that, it was … what\nwas the word …\nFond.\nYup, that would do.\n“Wayne?” she asked.\n“Oh, right. Um, well, this place is abandoned, right? So none of the stuff\nin it belongs to anyone.”\n“Well, I’m sure a lot of people would claim it,” MeLaan said. “But\nownership would be tough to prove.”\n“So…”\n“So I’d say don’t touch anything anyway,” MeLaan said.\n“Oh. Right.”\nShe smiled at him, then continued on in through the open doorway behind\nthe statue. It was big, gaping, like a fellow’s mouth after you kick ’im right\nin the canteen.\nHe looked back at the statue, then poked at the spearhead with his toe.\nThen he hit it with his heel. Then he hit with a rock. Finally, he twisted it a\nfew times.\nIt fell right off, clanging to the stone beneath. It had been practically\nhanging free. And Wax was wrong, only the head was of metal—the\noversized spear was wood. Aluminum, you say? Wayne thought with a smile.\nNow, he didn’t care much for what rich folks said was worth money.\nUnless it was, by itself, worth more than a house. Little Sophi Tarcsel, the\ninventor, did need more funds.\nHe wrapped the big spearhead, which was as large as his palm, with a\nhandkerchief to keep it from freezing his fingers off, and started whistling as\nhe jogged after the others. As he passed, he noticed that there once had been\ngates on this doorway, big ones, but they lay in frozen splinters."

As he passed, he noticed that there once had been\ngates on this doorway, big ones, but they lay in frozen splinters.\nThe others had gathered inside, where the temple had some kind of\nentryway. It had murals on either side, just like the ones that the strange\nkandra chap had shown back in Wax’s mansion. Wayne stepped up to one,\nbeside Wax, who was inspecting it.\nYup. Same mural. One depicting a pair of bracers on a pedestal, the other\n—across the way—depicting the Lord Ruler wearing them.\n“We’ve found the place for certain, then,” Wax said. “The statue was\nenough evidence, but this seals it. ReLuur was here.”\nTogether they left the entryway, stepping through its only door into a long,\ndark hallway. What were those lumps ahead? MeLaan and Steris held their\nlanterns higher, though nobody seemed to have any inclination to be the first\none to proceed.\nThe masked fellow, though, he was muttering something in funny-talk. He\nseemed to be following something with his eyes. A metal pattern on the\nwall? He stepped to the side, and dug the little grenade from his pocket. He\ndid something, opening its side, then used tweezers to extract what looked\nlike a small nugget of metal. He shoved it into a cavity in the wall, then\npulled down a lever.\nWayne heard what he thought was distant humming, then a series of small\nblue lights started glowing on the walls. As was appropriate to match the\natmosphere of this rusting place, they were creepier than Steris in the\nmorning. There were no bulbs or anything rational like that, just sections of\nthe walls that seemed to be made of translucent glass that glowed in a\ndownright gloomy way.\nIt was enough to light up the lumps on the floor. Bodies. A right disturbing\nnumber of them, lying in awkward positions. And those pools around\nthem … frozen blood.\nWayne whistled softly. “They really went far to give this place a creepy\nlook.”\n“Those bodies weren’t here originally,” Wax said dryly. “I think they must\nbe— Wayne, what the hell is that?”\n“It fell right off,” Wayne said, clutching the spearhead, which was cold to\nthe touch, even through the handkerchief. The tip was peeking out on one\nside. “I didn’t even look at it, Wax. Musta been loosened by the wind. See, it\nhas a hole on the bottom for screwing off and—”\n“Don’t touch anything,” Wax said, pointing at him. “Else.”\nMeLaan gave him a look.\n“You shut up,” Wayne said to her.\n“Didn’t say a word, Wayne.”\n“You implied one. That’s worse.”\nWax sighed, looking at the pilot fellow, who was inspecting some carvings\non the wall. “Allik?” Wax said, then tapped the medallion he’d tied to his\nwrist.\nThe masked man sighed, but swapped out one of his medallions for the\nother. He immediately shivered. “I have now been to hell,” he said. “These\nmountains will rise all the way there for certain.”"

Hell must be the other way. What did you want of me,\nGreat Metallic Destroyer?”\nWax sighed. “Bodies,” he said, nodding down the hallway. “Traps?”\n“Yes,” Allik said. “The ones who built this place were charged with\nprotecting the Sovereign’s weapon. They knew others would eventually\nfollow, and so the builders were bound to make it difficult, knowing that\nthey could not remain to guard in person. Not in this place of ice and death.\nBut…”\n“What?” Wax said.\n“Those masks,” Allik said.\n“The masks of Hunters?” Wax asked.\nAllik looked at him, shocked. “How did you recognize them?”\n“I didn’t,” Wax said, walking forward carefully. Wayne joined him, as did\nMeLaan. Wax waved for Marasi, Steris, and Telsin to remain back, though\nhe gestured for Allik to join them.\nTogether, the four of them walked to the first set of corpses. Wax knelt\ndown beside the pool of frozen blood. The closest fellow had died miserably,\nwith a spike through his chest. Wayne could see the trap now, the tip of it\nstill jutting from the wall. The poor fellow’s mates must have tried to pull\nhim free of the spike, but then had gotten caught in traps themselves.\nThe masks were different from Allik’s, that was for sure. Made of wood\nwith bits of glass stuck to them, each in a different, odd pattern. And these\nones showed the mouth, covering the top half the face, then running down\nthe sides. The skin there, at the sides of the mask, seemed to have melded\nwith the wood—though that might be because everything in here was as cold\nas a spinster’s bedroom.\nWax nudged the mask. “You said the Hunters came to destroy this place.”\n“Yes,” Allik said.\n“Well, I think they either lied to you, or changed their minds.” Wax\nnodded toward the busted doors, then down the hallway, littered with bodies.\n“The lure of the Bands was too powerful for these fellows. I’d guess the\ndead ones we found near the ship were the ones determined to go through\nwith blowing up the whole place. Got betrayed, but then these betrayers in\nturn fell to the traps. The ones who returned home; what happened to them?\nVanished?”\n“Yes,” Allik said, cocking his head. He raised his mask, revealing a\nwonderfully silly mustache and beard, then regarded Wax with awed eyes.\n“They went back to the Hunters. Then … gone. Returned to their families, it\nwas said.”\n“Executed,” Wax said, rising. “It was discovered they helped murder the\nrest of their crew, then tried to steal the Bands.

Steris,\nTelsin. I want you to stay behind while—”\n“I’m going with you,” Telsin snapped. She walked forward, cold as the\ndead blokes on the floor. “I won’t be shoved aside, Waxillium. I won’t be left\nfor our uncle to catch up to us and take me again.”\nWax sighed, looking toward Steris and Marasi.\n“I’ll stay,” Steris said. “Someone needs to watch the entrance for Suit and\nhis people.”\nWax nodded, glancing at Wayne. “You keep an eye on her.” Then he\nlooked to Marasi. “You keep an eye on him. We’ll come get you if we find\nanything.”\nMarasi nodded. Wayne sighed.\n“You intend to go forward?” Allik said, standing up, eyes bulging. “O\nGreat Impetuous One, far be it from me—a lowly pilot—to question your\nridiculous intentions, but … seriously? Didn’t you see the corpses?”\n“I saw them,” Wax said. “MeLaan?”\n“On it,” she said, striding forward.\n“Great One,” Allik said, “I cannot but think they have traps designed to\nkill your kind. If they thought of all this, they will have prepared for one\nsuch as you.”\n“Yes,” Wax said. “That spike was all wood.”\nAllik grew more frantic. “Then why would you—”\nMeLaan stepped on a pressure plate, causing a spear to launch out of one\nof the many small holes in the wall. It moved jarringly fast, piercing right\nthrough MeLaan’s torso, coming out the other side.\nShe sighed, looking down. “This is going to absolutely ruin my\nwardrobe.”\nAllik gawked, then lifted his hand as if to raise his mask, only it was\nalready up. He fumbled, unable to take his eyes off MeLaan, who yanked the\nspear out with a casual gesture.\n“Traps,” Wax said, “are somewhat less threatening when you have an\nimmortal along.”\n“Unless they have explosives,” MeLaan said. “If I lose a spike, you’d\nbetter be ready to stick it right back in. And I was serious—this is going to\nbe awful for my clothing.”\n“You could do it without,” Wayne said hopefully.\nShe thought for a moment, then shrugged, reaching to grab her top.\n“I’ll buy you new clothing, MeLaan,” Wax said, interrupting her. “We\ndon’t want to make poor Allik fall over dead.”\n“Actually,” Allik said, “I don’t think I’d mind.”\n“Good man,” Wayne said. “Knew I liked you.”\n“Ignore them,” Wax said. “Wayne, help guard the door.

Wayne couldn’t grow a proper beard either, but at least he had the\nsense to shave.\nMeLaan strolled down the hallway. “Telsin, stay behind me,” Wax said,\n“and step exactly where I step. Same for you, Allik.”\nThey left Wayne and the two ladies behind. Ahead, a large spiked log\nswung out of a hidden compartment and crushed MeLaan against the wall.\nShe shook it off like a champ, stumbling on down the hallway while her leg\nre-formed.\n“You know,” Wayne said, looking toward Steris and Marasi, “she might\nbe even better at the Blackwatch Doublestomp than I am.”\n24\nMarasi settled in beside Wayne and Steris, watching the approach to the\ntemple. Distant lanternlight showed Suit’s group. But they were getting\ncloser.\nWhat would they do if the man got here? Fight? For how long? Eventually\ntheir medallions would run out of heat, and they had almost nothing in the\nway of supplies.\nThey’d simply have to count on Waxillium finding the Bands quickly;\nthen they could escape on the skimmer and be away before Suit could do\nanything.

Stay out of trouble. Babysit Wayne. She knew that wasn’t\nwhat he meant, but it was still galling.\nRather than sit and simmer in her own petulance, Marasi dug in her purse,\npulling out the little spike that belonged to ReLuur. Such a small thing, and\nso clean—a shining sliver of … pewter, was it? Staring at it in the light of\nSteris’s lantern, she wished she didn’t know its history. A person had been\nkilled to make this, their soul ripped apart so a piece could be used to make a\nkandra.\nEven though it had been done long ago, to someone who would have been\ncenturies dead by now anyway, she felt as if there should be blood beneath\nher fingers, making the spike slippery. It should not be so clean.\nYet, she thought, where would mankind be without the kandra, acting as\nHarmony’s hands—guiding and protecting us? Such good to come of\nsomething so awful. Indeed, according to the Historica, without the work the\nkandra had done through the ages collecting atium, mankind would likely\nhave been destroyed.\nThe Lord Ruler is the same, Marasi thought. He was a monster. He created\nthis spike by killing someone. And yet he somehow managed to get to Allik’s\npeople and save their entire civilization.\nWaxillium sought justice.

Was that why she was so annoyed with\nhim lately?\n“You bein’ careful with that?” Wayne asked, nodding toward the spike.\n“You don’t want to prick yourself and turn into a kandra.”\n“I’m pretty sure that’s not how it works,” Marasi said, tucking it back into\nher purse.\n“Never can tell,” Wayne said. “I think I should carry it. Just in case.”\n“You’d swap it for the first trinket we passed, Wayne.”\n“No I wouldn’t.” He paused. “Why? You see somethin’ good back there?”\nMarasi rose and walked to Steris, who had settled primly on a stone shelf\nalong the wall of the temple’s vestibule. She sat in a ladylike posture, knees\nforward, back straight, writing carefully on a notebook by lanternlight.\n“Steris?” Marasi asked.\nThe woman looked up and blinked. “Ah. Marasi. Perhaps you can help me\nwith a topic. How useless am I?”\n“Excuse me?”\n“Useless,” Steris said, holding her notebook. Not her little pocket one; her\nlarger one, full-sized, which she’d brought in her pack. She used it for\nbrainstorming lists.\nToday, she’d been writing on the back of it. “I’ve been trying to quantify\nit, for reference purposes,” Steris said. “I am under no illusions as to my\nposition in this group. I am the baggage, the accident. The person who needs\nto be left with the horses, or sent to stay away from traps. If Lord Waxillium\ncould have sequestered me somewhere safe along the way and left me, he\ncertainly would have.”\nMarasi sighed, slumping down on the shelf beside her sister. Was this\nactually something the two of them could relate on? “I know how you feel,”\nshe said. “I spent the first year around him feeling unwelcome, as if\nWaxillium considered me some little puppy nipping at his heels. And now,\nwhen he finally does seem to have accepted me, he treats me as merely a tool\nto be used or put back on the shelf as required.”\nSteris cocked her head at Marasi. “I think you mistake me.”\nOf course I do, Marasi thought with resignation. “How?”\n“I did not mean to say I minded being treated this way,” Steris said. “I was\nmerely stating facts. I am quite useless on this expedition, and I think that is\nonly fair, considering my personal life experience. However, if I wish to\nimprove, I need to know how far I have to go. Here.”\nShe turned her notebook to show Marasi the back, where she’d been\nwriting. Why use the back? Either way, she’d drawn a small graph with\npoints plotted on it. Usefulness was listed on one axis, and it had names up\nthe other. Rusts—she’d assigned a number to everyone’s level of worth on\nthe mission. Waxillium was a hundred, as was MeLaan. Wayne was a\nseventy-five.\nMarasi was an eighty-three. She hadn’t expected that."

She hadn’t expected that.\n“I would say that ten is the threshold below which one’s uselessness\noutweighs the little one does add to the project. I’m thinking I might be a\nseven, as there are instances where it is better to have me along, though they\nare few. What do you think?”\n“Steris,” Marasi said, pushing the notebook aside. “Why do you care\nabout being useful here in the first place?”\n“Well, why do you?”\n“Because this is who I am,” Marasi said. “Who I want to be. But not you\n—you’re perfectly happy sitting in a parlor digging through ledgers. Yet here\nyou are, on the top of a mountain in a blizzard, waiting for a gunfight.”\nSteris pursed her lips. “I assumed,” she eventually said, “that I would be\nof help to Lord Waxillium at the party, and I was. It was my original\nunderstanding that this would be primarily a political enterprise.”\nOf course. So analytical in everything. Marasi settled back, glancing out\nthe doorway at those approaching lights. Wayne, fortunately, was watching\ncarefully. He acted the fool sometimes, but he took his duties seriously.\n“And then,” Steris said softly, “perhaps I came along because of the way it\nfeels.…”\nMarasi looked sharply back at her sister.\n“Like the whole world has been upended,” Steris said, looking toward the\nceiling. “Like the laws of nature and man no longer hold sway. They’re\nsuddenly flexible, like a string given slack. We’re the spheres.… I love the\nidea that I can break out of it all—the expectations, the way I’m regarded,\nthe way I regard myself—and soar.\n“I saw it in his eyes, first. That hunger, that fire. And then I found it in\nmyself. He’s a flame, Waxillium is, and fire can be shared. When I’m out\nhere, when I’m with him, I burn, Marasi. It’s wonderful.”\nMarasi’s jaw dropped, and she gawked at her sister. Had those words left\nSteris’s mouth? Careful, monotonous, boring Steris? She glanced toward\nMarasi and blushed.\n“You actually love him, don’t you?” Marasi asked.\n“Well, love is a strong emotion, one that requires careful deliberation to\n—”\n“Steris.”\n“Yes.” She looked down at her notebook. “It’s foolish, isn’t it?”\n“Of course it is,” Marasi said. “Love is always a foolish emotion. That’s\nwhat makes it work.” She found herself reaching over and pulling Steris into\na hug with one arm. “I’m happy for you, Steris.”\n“And you?” Steris asked. “When will you find someone to make you\nhappy?”\n“It’s not about finding someone, Steris. Not for me.”\nBut what was it about? She gave Steris another hug and, distracted by her\nown jumble of thoughts, went to check on Wayne.\n“What’cha thinkin’ about?” Wayne asked as she joined him beside the\nouter doorway.\n“I just had my long-held assumptions about someone shattered in a brief"

I’m wondering if every person I pass has similar depths, and if\nthere’s any way to avoid the mistake of judging them so shallowly that I’m\nrocked when they show their true complexity. You?”\n“I was lookin’ at you two,” Wayne said, contemplative as he regarded the\nsnowy landscape outside rather than her, “and wondering. Do sisters ever\nreally get sexy with one another for a fellow to watch, or does that only\nhappen in pub songs?”\nMarasi let out a long breath. “Thank you for restoring my ability to trust\nmy judgment, Wayne.”\n“Anytime.”\n“Those lights are still distant,” Marasi said. “You think they got trapped in\nthe snows?”\nWayne shook his head.\nMarasi frowned, noting his posture—seeming relaxed, but he’d gotten out\none of his dueling canes and rested it across his knees.\n“What?” she asked.\n“I figure,” Wayne said, “that if I knew I’d been spotted, the best way to\nsneak up would be to leave my lights behind and make it seem like I’m goin’\nslowly.”\nMarasi looked again. She ignored the lights this time, scanning a nearer\ndarkness full of shifting snow. And there, almost to the windswept patch of\nrock before the temple, she caught movement. Shadows in the shadows.\n“Time to call for Waxillium?” Marasi asked.\n“I think…” He trailed off, and Marasi pulled her rifle up, nervous.\n“What?” she asked.\nWayne pointed to an approaching shadow. It bore a little flag, crossed with\nan X. The symbol for parley.\n* * *\nWax pulled on the rope, helping MeLaan climb from the pit. She crawled\nover the edge, then flopped down. She’d been right about her clothing—it\nwas ragged, pierced in several dozen places, her left trouser leg ripped\ncompletely at the thigh.\nShe’d compacted her body, somehow. Most of her fatty curves had\nbecome taut muscles instead, and she’d taken off her hair, storing it in the\npack Allik carried, leaving her bald.\nWax knelt beside her, glancing down the hallway with its spikes, pits,\npoison darts, and other strange mechanisms. The entire temple seemed to be\none long passage, intended to be as hard to move through as possible.\nSomething about this is wrong, Wax thought. But what?\nMeLaan stirred on the ground.\n“Rest a moment,” Wax said, hand on her shoulder.\n“I don’t know if we have a moment, Ladrian,” she said, sitting up and\naccepting a canteen of water from the nervous Allik. Telsin stood nearby\nwith arms folded, obviously annoyed at how long this was taking. She kept\nglancing over her shoulder, as if at any moment she expected to find Suit\nthere to take her again.\n“How are your bones?” Wax asked MeLaan.\nShe held up her left arm—or tried to. It had snapped at the middle of the\nhumerus, and the rest of her arm dangled."

        "text": "“How are your bones?” Wax asked MeLaan.\nShe held up her left arm—or tried to. It had snapped at the middle of the\nhumerus, and the rest of her arm dangled.\nWax breathed out. “You’re sure that doesn’t hurt?”\n“Turned off the nerves that cause pain,” she said. “A trick we’ve learned\nover the last centuries. And since my bones are crystal, they can’t feel.” She\ngrimaced as the arm straightened, the break seeming to heal. But it hadn’t,\nWax knew—she couldn’t make bone, or heal it. “Another patch?”\nShe nodded. She had stretched ligament along the sides of the break to\nhold it tight. She’d done that with many of her bones already.\nMeLaan moved to rise.\n“We can find another way,” Wax said, standing. “Break in through one of\nthe walls up ahead, or the roof maybe.”\n“And how long will that take?”\n“Depends on how much we care about what’s inside.”\n“And wouldn’t it be silly to come all this way, then ruin the Bands of\nMourning because of our impatience?”\nWax looked down the hallway. They were most of the way through it, so\nhe put off pushing her further. He could see a door ahead.\n“You might not have to do much more anyway,” Wax said. “I think I have\nthe pattern figured out.”\n“What pattern?” MeLaan asked.\n“Pressure plate under the second stone to your right,” Wax said. “Shoots\ndarts.”\nShe glanced at him, then stepped forward and tapped it with her toe. Darts\nspat from the wall, passed before her, and bounced against the opposite wall.\n“Next one is two stones ahead,” Wax said. “There’s a hint of a metal line\nleading underneath it. So far, those have been wall traps.”\nAnother toe press. A portion of the wall opened, dropping a very large\nspiked log.\n“Nice,” MeLaan said.\n“Last one should be a pit trap,” Wax said, joining her in walking around\nthe fallen log. “Check your rope. The stones those are under are raised\nslightly.”\nShe tugged on it, using her right hand because the fingers of her left had\nbeen crushed. The crystal had broken beyond repair, and she now walked\nwith the hand permanently shut, splinters of bones fused together by\ntendons.\n“I hate the pit ones,” she said. “They just keep going down. Makes me\nafraid of what might be at the bottom.”\nShe stepped on the section of floor he indicated, and Wax held tightly to\nhis side of the rope, which was tied about his waist. But instead of a pit trap,\nthe ceiling opened, dropping a block of something. MeLaan jumped back,\nand the block of strangely colored ice banged to the stones beneath. It was\nwet, its surface oddly oily-looking.\n“What in Harmony’s Rings—” MeLaan said, squatting to inspect the ice.\n“Acid, maybe?” Wax said. “It looks like whatever they stored up there\nwas a liquid, but it separated over time, and half froze.”\nMeLaan stared at it a long time.\n“What?” Wax asked.\n“Nothing,” she said, shaking her head. “So that’s it?”"

But there was no handle. The rest of the\nwall was thick stone as well.\nThere were some markings carved into the door, if indeed that was what it\nwas. Circles, with symbols in them, inlaid in silver. Wax looked to Allik.\n“I don’t recognize any of those,” the pilot said after swapping his\nmetalminds. “If they’re writing, it’s not a language I understand.”\n“What do you want to do?” MeLaan asked.\n“Let’s get the others,” Wax said, thoughtful. “More brains to solve this\nwill be helpful, and Marasi might recognize those from ReLuur’s notes.”\nThey started back, letting MeLaan go first again—though Wax kept his\neyes open for any indicators of traps. It was still slow going, as she wanted\nto be careful they’d caught everything.\nTelsin fell in beside Wax, glancing once over her shoulder at the door,\narms wrapped around herself, though with the medallion she couldn’t be\ncold. Allik trailed behind them, wearing his warming medallion.\n“Do you ever wonder, Waxillium,” Telsin said softly, “how you got where\nyou are?”\n“Sometimes, I suppose,” he said. “Though I figure I can trace it. I don’t\nalways like it, but it makes sense, if I stop and think it through.”\n“I can’t do the same,” she said. “I remember being a child, and assuming\nthe world belonged to me. That I’d be able to seize it when I grew older,\naccomplish my dreams, become something great. Yet as I’ve aged, I feel like\nless and less is under my control. I can’t help thinking it shouldn’t be that\nway. How could I have been so in control as a youth, yet often feel so\nhelpless as an adult?”\n“That’s our uncle’s fault,” Wax said. “For keeping you captive.”\n“Yes, and no. Wax, I’m an adult—with greying hair and over half my life\nbehind me. Shouldn’t I have a clue as to what this is all about?” She shook\nher head. “That’s not Edwarn’s fault. What have we done, Waxillium? We’re\nalone. Our parents are dead. We’re the adults now, yet where are our\nchildren? What’s our legacy? What have we accomplished? Don’t you ever\nfeel like you never actually grew up? That everyone else did, but you’re\nsecretly faking?”\nNo, he didn’t feel that way. But he grunted in agreement anyway—it was\ngood to hear her show a side of herself other than feverish hatred of Suit and\nhis people.\n“Is that why you’re so keen to come here?” Wax asked. “You think that\nwhat we find in there will accomplish something?”\n“At least it will help society,” Telsin said.\n“Unless it destroys society.”\n“Pushing society forward is no destruction. Even if, in doing so, it leaves\nus behind.”"

Even if, in doing so, it leaves\nus behind.”\nShe withdrew into herself again. He couldn’t blame her, after her ordeal.\nHe wished there had been time to go back to Elendel, see her situated in\nsomeplace warm and safe, before flying back here.\nThey retraced their steps, passing the traps they’d already set off. Fallen\nblocks of stone from the ceiling, darts and spears from the walls, even a\nstone wall that had dropped to block them, though MeLaan had kept it from\nfalling all the way by slamming a large rock underneath. Wax had been able\nto wiggle into the space and Push a few coins upward to lift it farther, then\nthey propped it up with rocks in the tracks at the sides. They still had to\nstoop to go underneath.\nThey did find two more traps, which they set off as well. Wax found\nhimself increasingly dissatisfied. So much work, he thought, noting again the\nwall section that had fallen in to release scythes that cut the air. That trap had\ngotten entangled on itself, and so hadn’t endangered them at all—but the\ningenuity required to put it together was marvelous.\n“Allik,” he said, prompting the short man to swap back to his Connection\nmedallion. “Why would your people build such an obvious resting place for\nthe Bands? Why make this temple, which proclaims that something precious\nis inside, then go to the effort of making all these traps? Why not just hide\nthe Bands someplace unassuming, like a cave?”\n“They are a challenge, like I said, Thoughtful One,” Allik said. “And it\nwas not my people who did this, not specifically. The original priests who\ncrafted this place were of no people currently living among us.”\n“Yes,” Wax said, “and you told me the Sovereign left his weapon here\nwith orders to protect it because he was going to return for it. Right?”\n“That is the legend.”\n“These traps don’t make sense, then,” Wax said, waving back down the\nhallway. “Wouldn’t they have been worried for your king’s safety?”\n“Simple traps could not affect him, Unobservant Master,” Allik said with\na laugh. A nervous laugh. He’d glanced at MeLaan again. “The traps are a\ndeclaration, and a challenge.”\nThey walked on, but still Wax felt unsatisfied. Allik’s explanations made a\nsort of sense—as much sense as building the temple up in the mountains. It\nwas everything Wax would have expected from such a place, down to the\nsmallest details.\nPerhaps that was the problem.\n“Wax!” Wayne’s head poked into the corridor before them. They were\nalmost back to the front entryway. “Wax, there you are. Your uncle, mate.\nHe’s here.”\n“How close?” Wax asked, speeding up.\n“Close, close,” Wayne said. “Like, on our doorstep and demandin’ rent\nmoney close.”\nHe’d hoped to have the Bands before that happened. “We’ll need to try to\ncollapse the entryway,” Wax said as he reached Wayne. “Or maybe this\nhallway. Seal them out while we finish in here.”\n“We could do that,” Wayne said. “Or…”"

Seal them out while we finish in here.”\n“We could do that,” Wayne said. “Or…”\n“Or what?” Wax asked, stopping in place.\n“We’ve got him captured,” Wayne said, thumbing over his shoulder.\n“Marasi has a gun to his rusting head.”\nCaptured? “Impossible.”\n“Yeah,” Wayne said, sounding troubled. “He walked right up to us,\ncarrying a flag. Says he wants to talk. To you.”\n25\nWax passed from the temple’s vestibule onto the landing outside. Edwarn\nLadrian, his uncle, stood at the top of the steps, just beneath the statue of the\nLord Ruler. Wax was accustomed to seeing this man in a sensible suit,\nsurrounded by luxury—so it was somehow both strange and satisfying at the\nsame time to find Edwarn in a thick coat, hood up, fur brushing cheeks red\nwith the cold. His beard was stuck with snow, and he smiled at Wax, gloved\nhands resting atop an ivory walking stick.\nMarasi knelt in the doorway, her rifle trained directly on him. Edwarn\nstood alone, though his people—at least a hundred, perhaps more—were\nsetting up tents and dumping supplies in piles on the stone approach.\n“Waxillium!” Edwarn said. “Speaking out here in the cold would prove\nunpleasant. Might I join you and yours inside?”\nWax studied the man. What trick was he planning? Edwarn would never\nplace himself solely in Wax’s power, would he?\n“You can put the gun down,” Wax said to Marasi. “Thank you.”\nShe rose, hesitant. Wax nodded to Edwarn, who cheerily walked through\nthe doorway. Edwarn was a stout man, plump and round-faced. As Wax\nstepped into the doorway after him, Edwarn pulled off his gloves and put\ndown his hood, revealing a head of hair that was more silver than black. He\nremoved his parka; beneath it he wore stout trousers, suspenders, and a thick\nwhite shirt. However, as he folded the parka over his arm, his cheeks\nreturned to a normal color and he stopped shivering.\n“You do know what the medallions do,” Wax said.\n“Certainly,” Edwarn said. “But their reserves of heat are not eternal, and\nwe don’t know how to refill them. We had to reserve their use for those who\nwere suffering greatly from the cold during our trip.” He glanced toward\nAllik, who had moved up beside Marasi, taking her arm in one hand and\nstaring death at Edwarn.\nTelsin, Wax thought, seeking the woman out. If she shot their uncle as she\nhad that man in the warehouse …\nShe stood all the way across the vestibule, just outside of it, in the hallway\nwith the traps. Wayne had wisely sauntered over and stood nearby, back to\nthe doorway. He nodded lazily to Wax. He was watching her.\n“I see you stole one of my savages,” Edwarn said, gesturing at Allik. “He\ntaught you to use the medallions?

It is a pity we didn’t\ndiscover the smaller flying machines hidden in the large one. That would\nhave made my trip so much easier.”\n“Why did you come here, Uncle?” Wax demanded, stepping out of the\ndoorway and casually putting his back to the wall, in case there was a\nsharpshooter outside. He noticed, impressed, that Marasi had done the same.\n“Why did I come? For the same reason as you, Nephew. To find a\nweapon.”\n“I meant,” Wax said, “why did you come in here, to be taken by me.\nYou’re giving yourself up?”\n“Giving myself— Nephew, I came to negotiate.”\n“I have no need to negotiate,” Wax said. “I have you now. You’re under\narrest for treason, murder, and kidnapping. Allik will stand witness against\nyou.”\n“The savage?” Edwarn said, amused.\n“I also have—”\nEdwarn rapped his cane on the stones. It was banded in metal. Foolish;\nWax could use that against him.\n“No need, no need,” Edwarn said. “I am not in your custody, Nephew.\nStop entertaining this fantastical delusion that you can achieve anything by\nharassing me. Even if you were to somehow drag me back to Elendel and\nthrow me in a cage, I’d be released in days.”\n“We’ll see,” Wax said. He raised Vindication, pointing it right at Edwarn’s\nhead. “Run. Give me an excuse, Uncle. I dare you.”\n“So dramatic,” Edwarn said. “Did they teach you that in the Roughs,\nthen?” He shook his head. “Have you looked outside? I have twenty\nAllomancers and Feruchemists here, son. All well trained, and all ready to\nkill. You’re in my custody, if anything.”\nWax cocked Vindication. “Lucky that I’ve got you, then.”\n“I am not so important to the Set as all that,” Edwarn said with a smile.\n“Don’t think they wouldn’t shoot through me to get to you. But it won’t\ncome to that. You won’t use me as a hostage. What would there be for you to\ngain? We’ve already dug out your little flying ship. You aren’t getting out of\nhere alive. Not unless I order it.”\nWax clenched his jaw as Edwarn walked to the side of the entryway and\nsettled down on a stone shelf there. He fished in his pocket and brought out a\npipe, then nodded in greeting toward Steris, who had been seated on the\nshelf but immediately moved away.\n“Could I borrow that lantern?” Edwarn asked.\nSteris held out the lantern. He stuck a lighting stick into it, then used that\nin turn to light his pipe. He puffed at it a few times, then leaned back,\nsmiling pleasantly. “So?”\n“What do you want from me?” Wax said.\n“To accompany you,” Edwarn said.

And…” Edwarn hesitated. “Ahh, so you’ve been through the\ntraps, have you? Then you know about the door?”\n“How do you know this?” Allik said, stepping forward, fists clenched.\nMarasi put a warning hand on his shoulder, holding him back. “What have\nyou done to my crewmates?”\n“You’ve made yours talk too, I see,” Edwarn said. “A pity the Lord Ruler\ngave his fantastic knowledge to them, don’t you think? Barely men. They\nmust hide their—”\n“How do you know?” Allik continued, speaking more loudly. “About the\nhallway? About the door?”\n“Your captain knew many things you did not, I believe,” Suit said. “Did\nshe tell you about the group of Hunters she carried as subcaptain in her\nyouth? How she got them drinking, and listened to their secrets? They were\nplanning to return here, she said, for the prize.”\n“My captain,” Allik said, voice strained. “She lives?”\nSuit smiled, puffing on his pipe, then turned to Wax. “I can get you\nthrough the door. I have the key, passed from the lips of a dying priest, to a\ndoomed Hunter, to an airship captain, and now at last to me.” He spread his\nhands, smoking pipe in one.\n“You’re trying to trick me,” Wax said, narrowing his eyes.\n“Of course I am,” Suit said. “The question is, can you best me? Without\nan accommodation, we are at an impasse. My men outside can’t get in here.\nIt’s too fortified a position, and we can’t risk explosives lest we damage the\nprize. You, however, can’t get out. You can’t get the Bands without my help,\nbut you can’t pass my army of Allomancers either. You’ll starve in here.”\nWax ground his teeth. Rusts, he hated this man. Edwarn … Suit … he was\nthe infection that ate at the wounds of noble society. Spreading his disease.\nBringing fever. He was the very definition of the games Wax hated.\n“Waxillium,” Telsin said from the doorway. “Don’t trust him. He’ll trick\nyou. He’ll win. He always wins.”\n“We’ll try it your way, Uncle,” Wax said reluctantly. “I’ll let you open the\ndoor, but then you must return here.”\nEdwarn sniffed. “I get to go inside, past the door, and see what is there.\nOtherwise, you will get no help from me.”\n“You’ll be under guard. I’ll have a gun to your head.”\n“I have no objection to this.” He puffed on his pipe, held the smoke in his\nmouth, then let it out between the teeth of his smile.\nWax gave his uncle a thorough frisk. He had no Allomantically reactive\nmetal on his body save for that on his cane, but he didn’t have any aluminum\neither. At least not in a large enough concentration to be dangerous."

The shorter man nodded,\nwearing the bracelet that would let him heal great amounts, speed bubble at\nthe ready in case somehow Edwarn planned the activation of the door to be a\ntrap.\nWax Pushed. Something clicked.\n“Now there,” Edwarn said, pointing. “The one with the triangular shape.”\nClick.\n“Finally this one,” Edwarn said, tapping one with the back of his hand.\n“That’s it?” Wax said.\n“Get them wrong and the thing freezes shut, I’m told,” Edwarn said idly.\n“It has a clockwork timer. Won’t be ready again for ten years. You could\nspend a lifetime guessing, and still have only a small chance of opening it.”\nHe looked at Wax and smiled. “Apparently these symbols spell out\nsomething the Lord Ruler would have understood.”\nWax glanced back at Allik, who shook his head, baffled. “They really\nmake no sense to me.”\nWax turned around, held his breath, and Pushed on the final symbol. It\nclicked. Then, with a deep scrape of stone on metal, the entire thing slid to\nthe side, opening a path. Edwarn stepped toward it, but Wax leveled his gun,\ncausing the man to hesitate.\n“I’ll have you know,” Edwarn said, “that I worked a very long time to find\nwhat was in this place. It seems unfitting that another should pass that door\nbefore me.”\n“Tough,” Wax said, grabbing Telsin’s shoulder as she tried to slip by him\nand enter. “MeLaan?”\n“Right,” the kandra said. Rusts, she limped as she passed through the\ndoor. One of her legs was longer than the other, because of the breaks. She\nsaid she didn’t feel pain, but if she chose to lie to him, he’d never know.\nShe stepped into the other room, which had a soft blue glow coming from\nit. More of those glass lights in the walls.\n“Nothing hit me on the way in,” she said from within. “Want me to walk\naround a bit?”\n“Just around the doorway area,” Wax called to her, gun still held on\nEdwarn. “Make sure it’s safe for us.”"

No traps activated in the other room\nthat he could hear.\n“How can you wait?” Telsin asked. “Knowing what could be back there?\nA wonder beyond understanding.”\n“It isn’t going anywhere.”\n“You never want to know what’s beyond the door,” Telsin whispered.\n“You never did chase the horizon. Where is your curiosity?”\n“It’s alive and well. The things I’m curious about are simply different\nfrom the ones you find exciting.”\n“All clear,” MeLaan said from the other room.\nWax nodded for the others to go first, everyone but him and Edwarn.\n“Stay near the door,” he told them.\nOnce they were inside, he stepped closer to his uncle.\n“Threatening,” Edwarn said, looking him up and down. “You separated us\nfrom the others, Waxillium. Planning a little intimidation?”\n“I care for the people in that room,” Wax said softly. “I suspect more than\na monster like you can ever know.”\n“You think me emotionless?” Edwarn said, his voice stern. “I tried to\nspare your life, Waxillium. I argued before the Set on your behalf. There was\na time when I loved you like a son.”\nWax raised Vindication again.\n“When we’re done with this,” Wax said, “you’re going to give me names.\nThe others in the Set. I’m going to drag you back to Elendel, and there you’ll\ntalk.”\n“And you’d brutalize me to get those names, no doubt,” Edwarn said.\n“I follow the law.”\n“Which can be changed—or bent—to suit your needs. You call me a\nmonster; you hate me because I seek rule. And yet you serve those who do\nthe very same things as I. Your senate? It strangles the life from children\nwith its economic policies.” Edwarn stepped forward, a motion which put\nthe barrel of Wax’s gun right at his temple. “The longer you live, Waxillium,\nthe more you’ll know I am right. The difference between good and evil men\nis not found in the acts they are willing to commit—but merely in what name\nthey are willing to commit them in.”\n“Waxillium?” Marasi appeared at the stone doorway. “You’ll want to see\nthis.”\nWax ground his teeth together and felt his eye twitching. He pulled the\ngun away from his uncle’s head and waved it toward the door.\nEdwarn sauntered in, pipe trailing smoke. Wax followed, and entered the\nsolitary room at the center of the fortresslike temple. The dais here was the\none depicted in the mural at the temple’s entrance. It rose from the center of\nthe room, gilded and slender, with steps leading up to it. On it was a small\nsquare pedestal topped with red velvet and a golden rack suitable for the\ndisplay of a precious relic. A soft white light, not blue like those at the sides\nof the room, shone from above the dais and illuminated the whole thing.\nThe whole empty thing.\nShattered glass lay on the floor of the dais. Wax could pick out corners; it\nwas the remains of a glass box that had once topped the pedestal,"

Wax could pick out corners; it\nwas the remains of a glass box that had once topped the pedestal,\nenshrouding what had lain there.\nThe room was quiet and still, frost on the floor in places, dust disturbed by\nthe opening of the stone door floating in the air. There were no other doors or\nopenings in the walls.\n“Gone,” Wax whispered. “Someone beat us here.”\n26\n“Why’s everyone looking at me?” Wayne said.\n“Natural reaction,” Marasi said. She held a gun on Edwarn, as did\nMeLaan.\nWax carefully picked his way across the floor. Looks like a throne room,\nhe thought absently. The others started to follow, and he held them back with\nan upraised hand.\n“Stay in this center row walking toward the dais,” he ordered them, not\nlooking. “There’s a pit trap on either side, and that slightly depressed square\nover there? It’ll drop a sharpened blade from the ceiling.”\n“How does he know that?” Steris asked. She clutched her notebook,\nwithin which she made lists.\n“Wax has a natural affinity for things what kill people,” Wayne said.\n“You’re all still lookin’ at me. Rusts, you think I somehow got in here and\nlifted the rusting thing?”\n“No,” Marasi admitted. “But someone did. ReLuur the kandra?”\n“No,” Wax said, crouching and picking among the pieces of glass on the\nsteps leading up to the pedestal. “These have been here a long time, judging\nby the dust.”\nThere was no way the kandra had gone down that corridor outside. Too\nmany traps were left, and all the ones that had been sprung had bodies near\nthem.\nIt was likely that the kandra had snapped his pictures and wisely returned\nhome to gather more of his kind and mount a proper expedition. Kandra\nwere immortal; he wouldn’t be hasty in trying to get in here. He’d have\nplanned to take years studying the temple and extracting its secrets.\nWho, then?\nTelsin passed him, stepping to the dais. Glass crunched under her feet, and\nWax glanced up to see her staring at the empty pedestal, aghast. “How?” she\nmurmured.\nMeLaan shook her head. “What would you do, if you’d secretly stolen the\nthing? Leave the place gaping open to let everyone know, or reset the traps\nand sneak away?”\nNo, Wax thought. Reset the traps? Unlikely. He glanced at his uncle, who\nstood with pipe in hand, staring at the dais with bristling anger. He was\nsurprised by this.\nOr was that an act? Was this all a setup, after taking the Bands, to throw\nWax off? Wax brushed the dust from a piece of glass, then dropped it and\nselected a larger chunk, one of the corner pieces. Wax eyed it critically, then\ntook another piece and set it alongside.\n“This is a disappointment,” Edwarn said. He seemed genuinely troubled.\nThis wasn’t him, Wax thought, stretching out one of his mistcoat tassels\nand using it judge the length of the shard of glass. No, this goes back way\nfurther than that.…"

A small\nvelvet-topped pedestal, frozen in time.\n“I guess that is that,” Edwarn said. “Time for this to end, then.”\nWax spun, whipping out his gun. He pointed it not at Edwarn, but at his\nsister.\nShe stared him down, hand at her pocket. Then she slowly removed a gun.\nWhere had she gotten that? He couldn’t sense it. Aluminum.\n“Telsin,” Wax said, voice hoarse.\nEdwarn wouldn’t have come in here without a mole. She made the most\nsense. But rusts.\n“I’m sorry, Waxillium,” she said.\n“Don’t do this.” He hesitated. Too long. She raised the gun.\nHe fired. She did the same. His shot swerved away from her, Pushed by\nAllomancy. But her shot—aluminum—took him just below the neck.\n* * *\nMarasi moved before she had time to think. Her rifle already in position, she\nshot at Suit. Whatever was happening, having him dead couldn’t hurt.\nUnfortunately, her bullet veered as well, missing Edwarn. Then her\nweapon flew backward from her hands. Suit smiled at her with infuriating\nunconcern.\nAt the pedestal, Waxillium stumbled back. He’d been hit right where the\ncollarbone met his neck. He tried to remain on his feet, but Telsin shot him a\nsecond time, in the abdomen. Waxillium collapsed, rolled down the steps to\nthe base of the dais, and groaned.\nEdwarn was an Allomancer.\nTelsin was in the Set.\nAgain, Marasi reacted before she knew what she was doing. Wayne leaped\nfor Suit, but Suit took a hit from the dueling canes without flinching, then\nused his own cane—which was banded in metal—and Pushed it against\nWayne.\nWayne was flung toward Marasi, canes clattering to the floor. He grunted,\nhitting the ground as Marasi tried to leap for Suit. Perhaps if she caught just\nhim in a bubble with her, Wayne could—\nHer metal reserves were gone. Wayne stumbled up behind her, looking\nsimilarly confused. Telsin had tossed something between the two of them.\nA small metal cube. Another Allomantic grenade. She was an Allomancer\ntoo. She tossed a bag of something to Suit. Coins.\nWayne recovered from his surprise, leaping toward Edwarn again. But the\nman Pushed a handful of coins. Wayne cursed, flinching in midair as the\ncoins ripped through his body. Marasi watched in horror, and nearby\nsomeone screamed.\nShock. No. She wouldn’t let herself be stunned. She hurled herself at Suit,\nthough he casually shoved her aside. She briefly caught hold of his shirt as\nshe fell, but then her fingers slipped. Her head knocked against the stones as\nshe hit.\nDazed, she was able to see Waxillium stumble to his feet. He lurched,"

He lurched,\nbleeding, as Telsin fired again. Then he charged: but not for the doorway, or\nfor Suit. He scrambled toward the side of the room, away from everything.\nThe only thing in that direction was a corner, surely trapping him—\nThe floor dropped, plunging Waxillium into the pit.\nNearby, Wayne climbed to his feet.\n“Keep him down!” Suit shouted, launching coins at Wayne.\nTelsin, atop the dais, fired on Wayne. She wasn’t a terribly good shot, but\nbetween her and Edwarn, they managed to hit several times.\nThat didn’t drop him, not with the gold metalmind. He made a rude\ngesture and ran out the door, healing from the wounds almost as soon as he\nwas hit.\nSuit growled as Telsin’s weapon clicked, out of bullets. Marasi tried to\ngrab Suit by the legs and maybe trip him, but he kicked her in the chest. She\ngrunted, breath knocked out of her, and Suit put his foot against her throat.\n“Wayne!” Suit yelled. “Come back or I’ll kill the others!”\nNo reply. Wayne, it seemed, had taken the chance to escape down the\nhallway outside. Good. He wasn’t abandoning them; he had correctly\nrealized that their chances were best if he escaped.\n“I’ll do it!” Suit yelled. “I’ll kill her!”\n“You think he cares about that?” Telsin asked.\n“Honestly, I can’t tell with that one,” Suit said. He waited a moment to see\nif Wayne replied, then sighed, taking his foot off Marasi’s neck.\nDazed, still having trouble breathing, she took stock of the situation.\nMeLaan was writhing on the floor. When had that happened? Allik and\nSteris stood frozen with wide eyes. This had all taken place in a flash. A few\nyears back, Marasi would have been like those two, stunned and confused.\nShe was impressed, on one level, that she’d been able to react as quickly as\nshe had.\nHer growth hadn’t been enough. Edwarn picked up her rifle, sighting it on\nher. “Over you go,” he said, gesturing with the gun for Marasi to crawl to\nSteris and Allik so he could cover them all at once. She considered trying\nsomething, but what? Her metal reserves were gone, and the import of what\nhad just transpired was settling upon her.\nWaxillium was maybe bleeding to death at the bottom of that pit. Wayne\nhad escaped, but had no bendalloy. MeLaan was down.\nShe might have to do something about this herself.\n“Please,” Allik said, frantically grabbing Marasi by the arm as she joined\nthe other two. “Please.”\nHe was panicked, but she couldn’t blame him. He’d seen Waxillium—the\nman he worshipped—fall, and was once again in Suit’s hands. Steris\nnarrowed her eyes at Telsin.\nWaxillium had seen the truth, but too slowly.

For all his cleverness, Waxillium had a hole\nin his judgment regarding Suit and Telsin. He always had.\nNot that you did any better, Marasi thought.\nTelsin walked calmly down the steps, holding her handgun before herself.\n“That was bungled.”\n“Bungled?” Edwarn said. “I thought it went well.”\n“I let Waxillium escape.”\n“You shot him thrice,” Edwarn said. “He’s as good as dead.”\n“And you’re going to trust that?” Telsin asked.\nEdwarn sighed. “No.”\nTelsin nodded, her expression calm as she slid a knife from her pocket,\nthen knelt and plunged it into MeLaan. Steris cried out, stepping toward\nthem.\n“What did you do to her?” Marasi asked.\nThey didn’t answer, but Marasi suspected the truth. There were liquids\nthat, when injected into kandra, immobilized them and made them start to\nlose their shapes. It was temporary, but Marasi could only guess that while\nshe had been focused on Suit, Telsin had somehow used one of those on\nMeLaan. With her arms twisted, her legs broken, the kandra’s skeleton\nhadn’t been in any shape for her to fight.\nTelsin worked for a gruesome moment and came out with a spike. She\ntucked it into her pocket, then kept working. Suit walked over to Marasi, and\nthrough his ripped shirt Marasi caught a glint of metal peeking between two\nof his ribs. Not a large spike like the one Ironeyes had. Something more\nsubtle.\nThey hadn’t just been experimenting with Hemalurgy—they’d used spikes\nto grant themselves powers.\nTelsin finally got the second spike out of poor MeLaan and pocketed it.\nThe kandra melted, a mess of greenish-brown flesh and muscles without\nanything to cling to—oozing out of her clothing, leaving her bones and her\nskull of green crystal to gaze vacantly at the ceiling.\nTelsin pointed toward the pit Waxillium had fallen into. “Chase him\ndown.”\n“Me?” Suit said. “Surely we can wait for—”\n“No waiting,” Telsin said. “You know him best. You hunt him down. He is\nstill alive. I’ve met rocks less durable than my brother.”\nSuit sighed again, but nodded this time, swapping guns with Telsin so\nhe’d have the aluminum pistol, then reloading it. He walked toward the pit.\nMarasi glanced at Telsin, who watched MeLaan’s remains but held the rifle\nat the ready.\nShould Marasi charge her? Suit obeyed her. She wasn’t simply a member\nof the Set; she outranked Waxillium’s uncle. And she was obviously an\nAllomancer; the way she’d used the Allomantic grenade proved that.\nSuit climbed down, using a rope. Shortly after that, Marasi heard footsteps\noutside, and soon an array of soldiers in uniforms like those from the\nwarehouse piled in.\n“The short one,” Telsin said, urgent. “Wayne. Did you pass him?”\n“Sir?” one of the soldiers asked. “No, we haven’t seen him.”"

I need as many men as\nwe can get scouring that hallway and the plain outside. He’s extremely\ndangerous, particularly if he has another vial of bendalloy.”\nMarasi turned to Steris, who was still dazed, eyes wide, still looking at the\nhole where Waxillium had fallen.

Darkness. The pit had twisted\nduring the fall—he remembered ramming into one of its curves—and\ndeposited him here.\nRusts … how could his vision swim when he couldn’t see anything? He\nfumbled at his gunbelt and came up with a vial, which he managed to down,\nreplenishing his metal reserves.\nYou coming? Of course you’re not. You never want to risk trouble.\nNo. He could see something. A lone candle in a black room. He blinked\nhis eyes, but it was gone. A vision of the past. A memory …\nLight in a dark room. Set there to distract …\nThat was what the dais up above had been. The Bands had never been\nthere. The people who had built the place left the broken glass, the empty\nrack, the dais and the pedestal—all as a ruse. But they’d made a mistake.\nThe glass box they’d broken had been too large to fit on the pedestal.\nCandle in a dark room … Wax thought. That meant the Bands were\nsomewhere else. He blinked, and thought—as his eyes adjusted—he actually\ncould pick out light.\nHe wasn’t in a narrow pit. That hole had dumped him out somewhere. He\nheaved himself over in a twist, coming to his knees, and felt at his gut. Blood\nthere. A bad hit, all the way through, judging by the wetness he felt trickling\ndown the back of his thigh. He’d taken a shot to the leg too, but that didn’t\nmatter. He’d broken that leg in his fall anyway.\nThe shot near his neck was the worst. He knew this without even touching\nit, knew it by the way his body worked—by the way pieces of him were\ngrowing numb, the way certain muscles didn’t respond right.\nThat light. A soft blue. Not a candle, but one of the built-in lights of the\nbuilding. He crawled toward the light, dragging his broken leg, scraping on\nstone, sweat streaming down the sides of his face and mixing with the blood\nhe spilled to the ground.\n“Harmony,” he whispered. “Harmony.”\nNo reply. Now he prayed? What of his hatred?\nFor a time, that light was everything to him. An hour could have passed as\nhe crawled, or perhaps it had been only a minute.

He was fading quickly. Still, a shade more\nalert, he saw those sentries for what they were. Corpses. Seated, somehow,\ndraped in warm clothing. He passed the first row of them and looked in on\nfrozen faces, shriveled with the passing of time but remarkably well\npreserved. Each held a mask in its lap. They sat in four concentric rings,\nlooking at the light up ahead.\nHere, the ones who had built this place had died. Then how … how had\nword of the key to the door been passed on.…\nWax crawled among the huddled dead, frozen despite their warm clothing.\nHe could imagine them seated here, waiting for the end, as the heat in their\nmetalminds dwindled. The cold, creeping in as night does after sunset, a\nfinal, consuming darkness.\nAnd ahead, another pedestal. Smaller, carved of white rock. A simple light\nglowing on its top revealed a set of metal bracers. No fancy trimmings here,\njust the silent reverence of the dead.\nSomething sounded behind him, a scrape of boots on stone; then a light\nflooded the room from there.\n“Waxillium?” Edwarn’s voice called.\nWax huddled down.\n“I know you’re here, son,” Edwarn said. “That’s quite the trail of blood\nyou’re leaving. This is over, as you must realize.”\nHe’s an Allomancer now, Wax thought, remembering what Edwarn had\ndone to Marasi’s gun. The man carried a pistol, the aluminum one that Telsin\nhad used.\nTelsin … How long had she been working with them? He hated that he’d\nguessed, hated that his first instinct—even if he’d been right—had been to\npull a gun on his only sibling. It just made too much sense. She’d caused\nWayne to knock the backpack out the door. She’d killed the brute in the\nwarehouse, when he’d been about to speak—potentially addressing her,\nouting her as a member of the Set.\nSuit wouldn’t … wouldn’t have come into the temple with them unless he\nhad the upper hand.…\nHe needed to stay focused. Edwarn was approaching. Wax was tempted to\nPush a bullet toward the man, but held himself back. Edwarn raised the light,\nilluminating the vast emptiness and looking slowly around himself. He\ndidn’t seem to have spotted Wax, and the bodies all had some metal on them,\nso Edwarn’s steelsight wouldn’t reveal Wax. But the blood trail would soon\nbetray him.\nStill, Wax waited. He bowed himself, huddling down in the line of figures,\nimitating their stooped postures.\nHave to get those bracers …\nHe’d get shot before he could reach them. If he could even make it that\ndistance without passing out."

Those who rule these days are not the men who smile at\ncrowds and make speeches.”\nEdwarn moved around a corpse, then followed Wax’s blood trail with his\neyes. Only a few more steps.\n“The day of kings has passed,” Edwarn said. “The day of mighty men to\nbe worshiped has gone, and with its passing goes the right of Allomancers to\npower. No more will their gifts hinge on the whims of fate. Instead, the\npowers will come to those who deserve them. Who can use them.”\nHe raised his foot to step, then hesitated, looking down.

You’d\nbe caught in it too.”\nEdwarn turned and looked right at where Wax was sitting, trying to hide\namong the corpses.\nWax raised his head. “It would have been worth the cost.” He still had his\nshotgun, but doubted he had the strength to use it. Instead, kneeling, he held\nout a single bloodied hand, clutching a bullet in it. “Shall we see how good\nyou are, Uncle?”\nA duel.

They’re insurance\nagainst the short one, who is still out here somewhere.”\n* * *\nThe roof fell in on them.\nWax shouted, diving toward the pedestal and the two simple bracers. Suit\ntook a different tack; he Pushed himself back away from the bracers, out of\nthe path of the stones.\nRock hit Wax like a fist slamming him to the ground. Bones crunched\ninside of him. He gasped, but got a mouthful of dust.\nHe knew how bad it was when the pain faded. As the dust settled, he\nfound he couldn’t move any part of his body. A weight rested on his back,\npinning him with his head to the side. One of his hands hung within his\nview, the fingers mangled. He couldn’t feel them. Nothing. Just his face.\nEnough to feel the tears of pain and failure on his cheeks.\nSteel. He tried burning it.\nHe felt a few wisps of it inside of him, a warmth that became the only\nthing he could sense."

He tried burning it.\nHe felt a few wisps of it inside of him, a warmth that became the only\nthing he could sense.\nRubble shifted nearby, and rocks clattered. A second later Suit appeared, a\ncut in his arm resealing. He dusted himself off and glanced at Wax.\n“The trouble with Hemalurgy is in its limitations,” he said. “If you kill a\nman and steal his Metallic abilities, the resulting gift to you is weakened.\nDid you know that? What’s more, if you spike yourself too much, you\nbecome subject to Harmony’s … interference. Indeed, by the stories, you\nmight open yourself to the interference of any idiot Soother or Rioter with\nenough talent.” He shook his head. “I am limited to three boons, even if we\nhave discovered how to make someone else be weak, while we gain the\nbenefit.”\nHe glanced toward the bracers. “But if there is a way to gain more powers,\nand not be subject to Harmony … now that would be something. I see why\nTelsin was so eager.”\nHe left Wax, passing the frozen corpses of the dead masked ones, bits of\nthem sticking from beneath fallen rocks. Crushed. Some even looked to have\nshattered.\nSuit stepped up to the pedestal. “Behold me, Waxillium. Today, I become\na god.”\nWax tried to cry out, but his lungs wouldn’t hold enough air. He tried to\nheave himself free, but his body no longer worked. He was dying. Though\nsteel burned fitfully inside of him, he was dying.\nNo. He was already dead. His body just hadn’t quite realized it yet.\nSuit held the Bands. Wax twisted his head as best he could, pinned as he\nwas, to see it. The bearded man smiled broadly, waiting.\nNothing happened.\nSuit strained, his face darkening. Then he turned the bracers around,\nlooking them over. He put them on.\nStill, nothing happened.\n“Drained,” he said with disgust. “After all this, we find them empty of\nattributes. What a waste.” He sighed, then walked over to Wax, sliding the\naluminum gun from his pocket. “I have no doubt that Irich’s scientists will\nbe able to puzzle out how the Bands were made. Take that thought with you\ninto the eternities, Waxillium. Be sure to shake Ironeyes’s hand for me. I\nintend to never meet him.”\nHe pressed the gun against Wax’s head.\nAnd then something slammed into Suit. The man cried out, and a scuffle\nfollowed, along with the gun discharging. Suit cursing. Feet on stone.\nA second later, Wayne scrambled into view. He knelt beside Wax and\nlooked him over, seeming horrified.\n“Wayne,” Wax croaked. “How…?”\n“Ah, ’s nothing,” his partner said. “Slipped out and fell down another of\nthose holes. That one ended in spikes, I’m afraid. But I was able to heal up\nand climb out, once the soldiers had passed, then slip into this pit. You\npicked a better hole to fall in than I did, for sure.”\n“Suit…”\n“He ran,” Wayne said. “Didn’t want to face me himself, not with me"

Right cowardly, that one.…” He trailed off, looking down at Wax’s\nbody, pinned by the rock. “I—”\n“Find Steris and Marasi,” Wax croaked. “Help them escape.”\n“Wax,” he said, shaking his head. “No. No. I can’t do this without you.”\n“Yes you can. Fight.”\n“Not that part,” Wayne said. “The rest of it. Livin’. We … we’ll get you\nout of this.” He rubbed his eyes with the heels of his palms, then looked at\nthe stone on top of Wax, then down at the blood pooling beneath.\nThen he sat back, running his hands through his hair, eyes wide, as if in\nshock. Wax tried to urge him on, but his lips wouldn’t move.\nNot enough strength.\n* * *\nMarasi huddled on the cold ground with Steris and Allik, surrounded by\narmed men who searched their possessions. It was still night out here, but\nsunrise had to be close.\nWaxillium would have found a way out of this.\nStop comparing yourself to him, she thought. Is it any wonder you stand in\nhis shadow, when that’s all you can see yourself doing?\nShe needed to solve this. A dozen plans ran through her head, all stupid.\nThe guard nearby still had her purse.\nReLuur’s spike, it might be in there. Since it was Hemalurgically\nInvested, it might not have registered to the eyes of an Allomancer looking\nfor metals on her. The guard dumped the purse out, spilling the contents onto\nthe cold stone.\nNo spike. Instead, among her notebooks and handkerchiefs tumbled a\npalm-sized wedge of metal. The aluminum spearhead from the statue?\nWayne, I’m going to … She gritted her teeth. When had he swapped her\nfor the spike? That man!\n“I searched that purse already,” another guard noted. “No weapons.”\n“Well then, what’s this?” the first guard said, picking up the wedge-shaped\npiece of aluminum.\nThe second guard snorted. “You’re welcome to try to kill someone with\nthat if you want. It’s dull.”\nMarasi wilted, feeling stupid. Even if she had the spike, what would she\ndo? She couldn’t overpower armed guards.\nThen what could she do?\nSomeone fell through the sky and thumped to the ground nearby. She\nperked up, thinking it must be Waxillium. Instead it was Suit, clothing ripped\nand dusty, carrying a gun. The guards saluted, the one with her purse\ndropping it and the metal wedge. One of her glass makeup jars rolled away.\nPoor Allik huddled beside Steris. He’d stopped shivering, and his skin was\nturning blue. Steris met her eyes, and looked resigned.\nSuit strode past. He looked far more intimidating dropping through the air\nusing Allomantic abilities than he had bundled up for the weather and\nstanding on the steps of the temple.\n“Is my brother dead?” Telsin demanded, turning from her group of\nengineers nearby.\n“Yes,” Suit said. “Though I encountered the short one.”\n“You killed him?”"

Two silvery bracers, each as long as a forearm. “There was a\nhidden chamber down there, Sequence. And my, what a secret it contained.”\nTelsin shoved between her scientists and scrambled up to Suit. She took\nthe bracers, awed.\n“They don’t work,” Suit noted.\n“What do you mean?”\n“They’re out of attributes, I think. Their reserves gone.”\n“But they grant Allomancy too,” Telsin said, putting them on and waving\ntoward one of the guards, who tossed her a vial of metals. She downed it,\neager.\n“Well?” Suit asked.\n“Nothing.”\nA decoy, Marasi thought. Like the glass case and the empty pedestal …\nyes, that had been one too. She could see now why Waxillium had been\ndoing his measuring.\nWaxillium. He couldn’t really be …\nNo. What could she do? Not fight. But think. These Bands were a decoy.\nA second layer of falsehood to confuse intruders.\nSo where were the real ones?\n* * *\nCandles in a dark room.\nThey’re another decoy, Wax thought, mind muddled. Those bracers were\ntoo perfect, just like the stories. They were left to fool us.\nLike the symbols of Wax’s old adversary, painted on the door of a\nmansion. Meant to distract. Delay.\nThis place was made for the Lord Ruler, Wax thought. Those traps …\nthose traps are stupid. What if one did catch him? The whole thing has to be\na decoy.\nSo what? There was another temple out there? Maybe they had hidden it\nin a cave?\nHe could barely see anymore. Wayne held his hand, tears streaming down\nhis face. Everything was fading. The cold … coming … like darkness …\nNo, Wax thought, it wouldn’t be somewhere else. He’d need to be able to\nfind it. He’d recognize it.…\nIt was.\nIt was here!\nWax gasped, and tried to form the words, eyes wide. Wayne gripped his\nhand, knuckles white.\nHe couldn’t feel it.\nThe darkness arrived, and Wax died.\n28\nWax stilled.\nWayne let the hand fall limp. He wanted to just sit here. Stare at nothing\nlike those fellows in rows nearby, the ones that weren’t crushed. Sit and\nbecome nothing.\nAll his life, only one man had believed in him. Only one man had forgiven\nhim, had encouraged him. The rest of this damned race could burn away and\nbecome ash, for all Wayne cared. He hated them all.\nBut … what would Wax say?\nHe left me, the bastard, Wayne thought, wiping his eyes. In that moment,\nhe hated Wax too. But then, Wayne loved him more than the hatred. He\ngrowled, and stumbled to his feet. He had no weapons; he’d dropped his\ndueling canes above."

He had no weapons; he’d dropped his\ndueling canes above.\nHe stared at Wax’s body, then knelt and felt along the man’s leg. He got\nahold of something and yanked it free. The shotgun.\nWayne’s hands immediately started shaking.\n“You stop that,” he hissed at them. “We’re done with that.”\nHe cocked the shotgun, then went looking for a way out of this tomb.\n* * *\nThe whole temple is a decoy, Marasi thought, trembling in the cold. So where\nare the actual Bands?\nThe place was built for the Lord Ruler, who would supposedly return to\nclaim his weapon. Where would you put that weapon?\nHe’d know what it looked like, Marasi thought. He built it. We think it was\nin the shape of bracers, but it didn’t have to be. Could be anything.\nThat would be smart, if you were making a weapon. These metalminds,\nyou had to know what they did before they worked. You could protect\nyourself, so only someone who knew what to look for could use your\nweapon.\nAnd in that case, the people who built the temple could have left the\nweapon where the returning Lord Ruler would see it, but everyone else\nwould pass right by, digging farther into the temple to encounter traps, pits,\nand decoys—all designed to either kill them or convince them that they’d\nsuccessfully robbed the place.\nWhere did you put the weapon? On the doorstep, under the sign of the\nSovereign himself, in his very own hand. Marasi turned, frantic, searching\nout the oversized spearhead.\nIt lay right beside her, where the guard had dropped it. Waxillium had\ncalled it aluminum because he couldn’t sense it, but he hadn’t looked closely\nenough.\nIf he had, he’d have seen it was made of different interwoven metals,\nwavy, like the folds forged into the blade of a sword. He couldn’t Push on it,\nnot because it was aluminum.\nBut because it was a metalmind, stored with more power than any they’d\never seen.\n* * *\nAround Wax, everything became misty and indistinct. The cavern, the rocks,\nthe ground itself—all just mist. He could stand on it somehow.\nHarmony stepped up beside Wax in the misty darkness. They fell in beside\none another, walking as was natural for men to do. God looked much as Wax\nhad always imagined Him. Tall, peaceful, hands laced before Himself. Face\nlike a long oval, serene and human, though He towed behind Him a cloak of\ntimelessness. Wax could see it, trailing after. Storms and winds, clouds and\nrain, deserts and forests, all reflected somehow in this creature’s wake. His\nrobe was the Terris V pattern, where each V was not a color, but an age. A\nstrata of time, like those of a deep rock uncovered.\n“They say,” Wax said softly, “that You come to all people when they die.”\n“It is a duty I consider to be among my most sacred,” Harmony said.\n“Even with other pressing matters, I find time to take this walk.” He had a\nquiet voice, familiar to Wax. Like that of a forgotten friend."

Like that of a forgotten friend.\n“I’m dead then.”\n“Yes,” Harmony said. “Your body, mind, and soul have separated. Soon\none will return to the earth, another to the cosmere, and the third … Even I\ndo not know.”\nWax continued walking. The shadowy cavern vanished, and Wax had a\nfeeling of blurring. Mists became darkness, and all he could see was a\ndistant light, like the sun below the horizon.\n“If You can take time to walk with us,” Wax said, bitter, “why not come a\nlittle earlier? Why not stop the walk before it must begin?”\n“Should I prevent all hardship, Waxillium?”\n“I know where this is going,” Wax said. “I know what You’re going to\nsay. You value choice. Everyone theorizes about it. But You can help.\nYou’ve done it before, in placing me where I needed to go. You intervene.\nSo why not intervene more? Prevent children from being killed. Make\ncertain that constables arrive in time to stop deaths. You don’t have to take\naway choice, but You could do more. I know You could.”\nHe left the last part unsaid.\nYou could have saved her. Or at least told me what I was doing.\nHarmony nodded. It felt bizarre to be demanding things, but rusts … if\nthis was the end, Wax wanted a few answers.\n“What is it to be God, Waxillium?” Harmony asked.\n“I don’t think that’s a question I can answer.”\n“It is not one I ever thought I’d have to answer either,” Harmony said.\n“But obviously, it has been forced upon me. You would have me intervene\nand stop the murders of innocents. I could do this. I have considered it. If I\nwere to stop every one, what then? Do I stop maimings as well?”\n“Of course,” Wax said.\n“And where do I hold back, Waxillium? Do I prevent all wounds, or do I\nprevent only those caused by evil people? Do I stop a man from falling\nasleep so that he will not tip a candle and burn down his house? Do I stop all\nharm that could ever befall a person?”\n“Maybe.”\n“And once nobody is ever hurt,” Harmony said, “will people be satisfied?\nWill they not pray to me and ask for more? Will some people still curse and\nspit at the sound of my name because they are poor, while another is rich?\nShould I mitigate this, make everyone the same, Waxillium?”\n“I won’t be caught in this trap,” Wax said. “You’re the God, not me. You\ncan find a line where You prevent the worst. You can find a line where You’re\nstopping the worst that is reasonable, while still letting us live our lives.”\nThe light ahead suddenly rolled outward, and Wax found that they’d been\nrounding a planet. They stood high above it, and had stepped from darkness\ninto sunlight, which let Wax see the world below, bathed in a calm, cool\nlight.\nBeyond that hung a haze of red. All around, pressing in upon the world.\nHe could feel it choking him, a miasma of dread and destruction."

It beat inward,\nbut he could see something, a thin strip of light—like a bubble around the\nworld—stopping it.\n“A representation,” Harmony said. “A crude one, perhaps.” He looked to\nWax and smiled, like a father at a wide-eyed child.\n“We’re not done with our conversation,” Wax said. “You let her die. You\nlet me kill her.”\n“And how long,” Harmony asked softly, “must you hate yourself for\nthat?”\nWax clenched his jaw, but couldn’t force down the trembling that took\nhim. He lived it again, holding her as she died. Knowing he’d killed her.\nThat hatred seethed inside of him. Hatred for Harmony. Hatred for the\nworld.\nAnd yes. Hatred for himself.\n“Why?” Wax asked.\n“Because you demanded it of me.”\n“No I didn’t!”\n“Yes. A part of you did. An eventuality I can see, one of many possible\nWaxilliums, all you—yet not set. Know yourself, Waxillium. Would you\nhave had another kill her? Someone she didn’t know?”\n“No,” he whispered.\n“Would you have had her live on, a slave in her mind? Corrupted by that\ncursed spike that would forever leave her scarred, even if replaced?”\n“No.” He was crying.\n“And if you had known,” Harmony said, holding his eyes, “that you’d\nnever have been able to pull that trigger unless your eyes were veiled? If\nyou’d realized what knowledge of the truth would do to you—stilling your\nhand and trapping her in an endless prison of madness—what would you\nhave asked of me?”\n“Don’t tell me,” Wax whispered, squeezing his eyes shut.\nThe silence seemed to stretch until eternity.\n“I am sorry,” Harmony said with a gentle voice, “for your pain. I am sorry\nfor what you did, what we had to do. But I am not sorry for making you do\nwhat had to be done.”\nWax opened his eyes.\n“And when I hold back, staying my hand from protecting those below,”\nHarmony said, “I must do it out of trust in what people can do on their own.”\nHe glanced toward the red haze. “And because I have other problems to\noccupy me.”\n“You didn’t tell me what it was,” Wax said.\n“That is because I do not know.”\n“That … frightens me.”\nHarmony looked to him. “It should.”\nDown below, a tiny spark flickered on one of the landmasses.

She felt\nthe Lord Ruler’s own power, stored in the Bands of Mourning—the\nspearhead clutched in her fingers—surge through her, and she felt she would\nburst. It was as if an ocean of light had suddenly been pumped into her\narteries and veins.\nBlue lines exploded from her, first pointing at metals, then multiplying,\nchanging, transforming. She saw through it all, everything in blue. There\nwere no people or objects, just energy coalesced. The metals shone\nbrilliantly, as if they were holes into someplace different. Concentrated\nessence, providing a pathway to power.\nShe was using the reserves with startling quickness. She slowed her speed,\nand for some reason the people beside her jumped, holding their ears.

Aren’t You omnipotent?”\n“Hardly,” Harmony said, smiling. “But I believe that parts of me could\nbe.”\n“That doesn’t make any sense.”\n“It won’t until I make it do so,” Harmony said, extending His hands to\neither side. “In answer to your question, however, you don’t fade just yet.\nThough soon. Right now, you make a choice.”\nWax looked from one of the deity’s hands to the other. “Does everyone get\nthis choice?”\n“Their choices are different.” He proffered His hands to Wax, as if\noffering them for him to take.\n“I don’t see the choice.”\n“My right hand,” Harmony said, “is freedom. You can feel it, I think.”\nAnd he could. Soaring, released from all bonds, riding upon lines of blue\nlight. Adventure into the unknown, seeking only the fulfillment of his own\ncuriosity. It was glorious. It was what he’d always wanted, and its lure\nthrummed through him.\nFreedom.\nWax gasped. “What … what is the other one?”\nHarmony held up His left hand, and Wax heard something. A voice?\n“Wax?” it said.\nYes, a frantic voice. Feminine.\n“Wax, you have to know what it does. It will heal you, Wax. Waxillium!\nPlease…”\n“That hand,” Wax said, looking at it. “That hand is duty, isn’t it?”\n“No, Waxillium,” Harmony said gently. “Although that is how you’ve\nseen it. Duty or freedom. Burden or adventure. You were always the one\nwho made the right choice, when others played. And so you resent it.”\n“No I don’t,” Wax said."

He landed and looked down at his\nleft hand. The one that had been dangling, broken, before his face as he died.\nClutched in it was an oversized spearhead crafted from sixteen different\nmetals melded together. He looked up from it and toward Marasi, who\nregarded him with tearstained eyes, but a broad smile.\n“You found it,” Wax said.\nShe nodded eagerly. “Just took a little old-fashioned detective work.”\n“You saved me,” Wax said.\nRust and Ruin … such power.

Break things?”\n“Break things,” Marasi said, “with style.”\nHe grinned, then downed the vial of metals.\n29\n“Waxillium’s followers have the Bands!” Suit whispered to himself as he\ncrossed the dark, stony field.

They will be coming for us. We must move up our timetables!”\nHe chewed on the words, mulling them over as he pulled his coat tight.\nWarming device notwithstanding, that wind was annoying.\nWould they buy his argument? No, not dire enough.\n“Waxillium and his people have the Bands!” he whispered to himself.\n“This will undoubtedly let the kandra devise the means of creating\nmetalminds anyone can use. We must move up our timetables and seize\nElendel now, or we will find ourselves technologically outmatched!”\nYes. Yes, that was the idea. Even the most careful of the Series would be\ndistressed by the prospect of being technologically outmaneuvered. This\nwould convince them to give him the leeway he desired.\nAnything could be an advantage. He’d wanted the Bands for himself, but\nin lieu of that, he’d find something else.\nSuit always found the advantage.\nHe passed soldiers scurrying about and unloading weapons on the frozen\nplain of rock. They’d planned for a potential fight here, as he’d worried he\nmight encounter more of the masked savages.\n“Sir!” one of the men called. “Orders?”\nHe gestured toward the sky. “If anyone other than the Sequence drops\nfrom the air or approaches your position, shoot them. Then keep shooting,\neven after they are down.”\n“Yes, sir!” the soldier said, waving to a group of his men. He turned\ntoward an empty rack, then paused. “My rifle? Who took my rifle!”\nSuit continued on past, tossing the fake Bands of Mourning into the snow\nand leaving the troops to—hopefully—slow down Waxillium’s minions. He\neagerly marched aboard the new airship. Now this device, this was an\nadvantage. The Bands could serve one man, make a deity out of him. A fleet\nof ships like this could deify an entire army.\nThe wooden hallway inside had gaslights set into lamps with austere\nmetal housings. It was all distinctly plainer than the ship that had crashed in\nDulsing—the wood here was unornamented, unpolished. The other ship had\nfelt decorated like a den. This one, a warehouse.\nProbably cheaper to build this way, he thought, nodding his head in\napproval.\nFootsteps clattered above as men charged through one of the corridors on\nanother deck, and Suit brushed the snow from his arms as a technician ran\nup to him, bearing the red uniform of the Set’s Hidden Guard.\n“My lord,” the man said, proffering one of the medallions. “You’ll need\nthis.”\nSuit took it and rolled up his sleeve to strap it to his upper arm. “Is this\nship operational?”\nThe man’s eyes lit up. “Yes, sir! The machinery is operational, sheltered\nas it was from the weather. Sir … it’s amazing. You can feel the energy\npulsing off that metal.

That should be the last step!”\n“Then lift us off,” Suit said, walking toward where he assumed the bridge\nwould be found.\n“My lord Suit?” the man called after him. “Aren’t we waiting for the\nSequence?”\nHe hesitated only briefly. Where had she gotten to?\nAnother advantage? he thought. He could stand being Sequence.\n“She will join us aloft if she can,” he said. “Our priority is to get this ship,\nand its secrets, to a secure location.”\nAs the technician saluted and ran to obey, Suit filled his medallion,\nbecoming lighter. So much easier than getting his spikes had been. It was\nhard not to feel that their experiments in Hemalurgy had been a waste, a\ndead end.\nThe ship quivered, and the fans started up with a much louder sound than\nhe had expected. Before he reached the bridge, the thing rocked, and he\nheard ice cracking above the sound of the fans. He leaned over to a porthole,\nlooking out as the ground retreated.\nIt worked. Immediately, implications flooded his mind. Travel. Shipping.\nWarfare. New regions could be settled. New types of buildings and docks\nwould be needed.\nIt would all flow through him.\nHe suppressed a smile—best to celebrate after he was safely away—but\nhe could not stop the heady sensation. The Set had been planning for events\na century or more away, putting careful plots into motion at his suggestion.\nHe was proud of those, but truth be told, he’d rather they rule in his lifetime.\nAnd with this, he could do so.\n* * *\nJordis huddled in the tent, watching her crew die.\nIt had been long coming, this death. The last ember of the fire, refusing to\ngive up its spark. During the terrible march through the dead rain, her people\nhad been given tiny sips of warmth from a metalmind. Enough to barely\nkeep them alive, like plants locked in a dark shed for most of the day.\nBut now, in this place, the cold was too pervasive—and the hardships of\nthe march too devastating. She crawled among her crew and whispered\nencouragement, though she could no longer feel her fingers or toes. Most of\nthe men and women of the ship couldn’t even nod. A few had started\nremoving their clothing, complaining of heat. Chillfever had struck them.\nNot long now. The maskless devils seemed to know this; they’d posted\nonly a single guard at the tent. Her people could have snuck away out the\nback, perhaps. But what would they sneak toward? Death outside in the\nwinds rather than death inside here?\nHow do the maskless survive it? she wondered. They must be devils\nindeed, born of the frost itself, to be so capable of withstanding the cold.\nJordis knelt beside Petrine, the enginemaster and eldest of her crew. How\nhad the woman survived so long? She was by no means feeble, but she was\npast her sixth decade. Petrine lifted her hand and gripped Jordis’s arm—\nthough her wrinkled eyes were shadowed by the mask, Jordis needed no\ngesture or expression to know Petrine’s emotions."

Petrine lifted her hand and gripped Jordis’s arm—\nthough her wrinkled eyes were shadowed by the mask, Jordis needed no\ngesture or expression to know Petrine’s emotions.\n“Do we attack?” Petrine asked.\n“For what purpose?”\n“We could die by their weapons instead of the cold.”\nWise, those words. Perhaps they could—\nA loud thump came from outside the tent. Jordis found her feet,\nsurprisingly, though most of the others remained huddling where they lay.\nThe front of the tent burst open and a man with a familiar—but broken—\nmask appeared there.\nImpossible. Was the chillfever striking her too?\nThe man raised his mask and displayed a bearded, youthful face. “I am\nsorry to have come in unannounced,” Allik said. “But I bear gifts, as is\ntraditional for visiting someone’s house unannounced, yes?”\nHe held up a gloved fist, which clutched a bundle of medallions by their\ncords.\nJordis looked from the medallions to young Allik, then back. For once she\ndidn’t even care about how free he was with raising his mask. She stumbled\nto him, seizing one of them, unable to believe.\nThe wonderful warmth ran through her, like a sunrise within. She sighed\nin relief, her mind clearing. It was him. “How?” she whispered.\n“I,” Allik proclaimed, “have made friends with some of the devils.” He\ngestured to the side and a female maskless one almost toppled in, wearing\none of the long dresses that were popular here, carrying an armful of rifles.\nShe said something in her language, dropping the guns to the floor of the\ntent and dusting off her hands.\n“I think she wants us to start shooting the other ones,” Allik said as Jordis\nquickly grabbed the other medallions and began distributing them to the\nmost severely afflicted of her people. “I, for one, am more than happy to\noblige.”\nPetrine continued the distribution as Jordis armed herself with one of the\nguns. Though the warmth was wonderful, she still felt weak, and she didn’t\nwant to look in her boots to see if her toes had frostbite. “I don’t know that\nwe will put up much of a fight.”\n“Better than no fight at all, yes, Captain?” Allik asked.\n“This is true,” Jordis admitted, and made a sign of respect, touching her\nright shoulder with her left hand, then lowering her hand to touch her wrist.\n“You did well. Almost I forgive you for your terrible dancing.” She turned to\nPetrine. “Arm the men and women with these weapons. Let’s kill as many of\nthe devils as we can.”\n* * *\nWax ripped from the temple in a burst of might and Allomancy. He spun\nabove the building, rocks flung by his explosive exit tumbling in the air\naround him, trailing mist. Below, a storm of gunfire broke out on the\npreviously quiet mountainside, though they weren’t firing at him.\nAbove it, an airship lumbered through the sky, fans whirring powerfully\non its two pontoons.

It moved with the ponderous motions of something very large, and\nvery heavy—even with the weight reduction granted by the medallions.\nWax was tempted to crush the ship. Push the nails from their mountings,\nrip the thing apart in a storm of destruction, dumping Suit and his traitorous\nsister to the frozen ground below. He almost did it. But … rusts. He wasn’t\nan executioner. He was a lawman. He’d rather die than betray that.\nWell, die again.\nHe dropped, then used the trace metals in the stonework of the temple as\nan anchor to send himself soaring across the ground in a swoop. A few of the\nsoldiers below took halfhearted shots at him, but most seemed engrossed in a\ngunfight with a group of people in masks who had taken up a position behind\na rocky shelf.\nSteris, Allik, Wax thought, identifying them. Good.\nHe landed among the soldiers and flung them aside. He grabbed an\naluminum pistol from one of their racks, loaded it, then waved to the masked\npeople before hurling himself into the sky after the airship.\nHe was strong. Incredibly strong. The Bands, still clutched in his left\nhand, somehow gave him not just Allomancy, but ancient Allomancy. The\npotency of those who had lived long ago, during the time of the Lord Ruler.\nPerhaps even more. Was that possible?\nWhat did you create? he wondered. And how long will it last?\nHis resources were diminishing. Not merely the metals inside of him, but\nthe reserves stored inside the Bands. Stores that changed his level of\nInvestiture.\nHe should have held back, he knew—reserved it for study, or for use in a\nfuture emergency—but rusts it was intoxicating. He reached the airship\neasily, despite only having a few shell casings to Push upon below. He\nsoared up and landed on the ship’s nose, then smashed his hand through one\nof the windows to the bridge, any cuts healing immediately.\nInside, Suit sat alone. There was no sign of pilots, technicians, or servants.\nJust a wide, half-oval deck, not even carpeted, and Suit in a chair.\nWax climbed in and raised the aluminum pistol. His boots thumped on the\nwood. He did a quick scan. People in the hallway outside, he thought. And a\nbit of metal in Suit’s mouth. The old coin-in-the-mouth trick, a way to hide\nmetal from an Allomancer. Anything inside the body was very hard to sense.\nUnless you were bearing the very powers of creation, that is.\n“And so,” Suit said, lighting his pipe, “our confrontation comes at long\nlast.”\n“Not much of a confrontation,” Wax said, still alight with power. “I could\ndestroy you a hundred different ways right now, Uncle.”\n“I don’t doubt that you could,” Suit said, shaking out his match, then\npuffing on the pipe. Trying to hide the coin. Talking around a pipe let him\nhave a reason to sound odd. “And here I can only destroy you one way.”\nWax leveled his pistol.\nSuit looked right at it and smiled. “Do you know why I’ve always beaten\nyou, Nephew?”"

That is an\nentirely different thing.”\n“But sometimes the only way to win is to refuse to fight.”\nWax strode forward, wary of traps. He thought faster, moved faster than\nnormal. The blue lines spread from him as a brilliant web, seeking sources of\nmetal smaller—and farther away—than he could normally sense. At times\nthis seemed to flicker, and for a moment he saw the radiance inside of each\nperson and thing. It felt as if he might be able to move those too.\nAn awed voice in the back of his mind whispered, They’re all the same.\nMetal, minds, men, all the same substance.…\n“What have you done, Uncle?” Wax asked softly.\n“And here I must answer my own question,” Edwarn said, shaking his\nhead and standing. “I beat you, Waxillium, not because of preparation—\nthough it is extensive. I beat you not because of wit or strength of arm, but\nbecause of a unique ability of mine. Creativity.”\n“You’re going to bludgeon me with paintings?”\n“Always quick with a wry comment!” Suit said. “Bravo.”\n“What have you done?”\n“I armed the bomb,” Suit said. “It is set to explode in mere moments.\nUnless I stop it.”\n“Let it explode,” Wax said, holding up the Bands—metallic strata\nweaving across the triangular chunk of metal. “I’m pretty sure I’ll survive\nit.”\n“And those below?” Suit asked. “Your friends? My captives? From the\nsounds of it, they’re fighting quite vigorously for their freedom. How sad it\nwill be to see them vaporized by an explosion I’ve been told should be\nenough to destroy a large city all on its—”\nWax increased the speed of his thoughts, tapping zinc. He sorted through a\ndozen scenarios. Find the explosives and Push them away? How far could he\nget them? Would Suit detonate the bomb before he could arrive?\nHis speed of body was nearly tapped out—Marasi must have used that in\ngetting to him—so yes, Suit would have time, though would he actually do\nit? Would he blow himself up, along with this ship, to defeat Wax?\nIf this were an ordinary criminal, Wax would have bet strongly against it.\nUnfortunately, Suit and the Set in general had demonstrated a level of\nfanaticism he had not expected. Like the way Miles had acted as he was\nexecuted. These people were not just thugs and thieves; they were political\nreformers, slaves to an ideal.\nWhat else? What else could Wax do? He discarded scenario after scenario.\nGet Marasi and the others to safety: too slow. Shoot Suit now: the man could\nheal himself, and Wax might not have time to get to the bomb and remove it\nbefore the blast happened anyway. Push the ship upward? He wouldn’t be\nable to do that fast enough; unless he Pushed slowly, he’d rip the vessel\napart.\n“—own,” Suit said.\n“What do you want?” Wax demanded. “I’m not going to let you go.”\n“You don’t need to,” Suit said. “I have little doubt that you’d chase me"

I might be creative, but you … you are\ntenacious.”\n“What, then?”\n“You drop the Bands out the window,” Suit said. “I order the bomb\ndisarmed. Then we face one another as men, without unnatural advantages.”\n“You think I’d trust you?”\n“You don’t need to,” Suit said. “Just give me your word you’ll do it.”\n“Done,” Wax said.\n“Disarm the device!” Suit shouted toward the door. He strolled to the front\nof the ship and spoke into a tube there. “Disarm it and stand down.”\nFeet thumped away from the door. Wax could actually watch them go—\nnot by their metals, but by the signature their souls made. In moments, he\ncould see nobody there, or hiding anywhere around the bridge.\nA voice soon echoed up through the tube. The tin Wax burned let him\nhear. “Done, my lord.” A pause. “Thank Trell for that.” The voice sounded\nrelieved.\nSuit turned to Wax. “There is a tradition in the Roughs, is there not? Two\nmen, a dusty road, guns on their hips. Man against man. One lives. The other\ndies. A dispute settled.” He patted the sidearm at his hip. “I can’t give you a\ndusty road, but perhaps we can squint and pretend that the frost is playing\nthat role.”\nWax drew his lips to a line. Edwarn looked entirely sincere. “Don’t make\nme do this, Uncle.”\n“Why?” Suit said. “I know you’ve been itching for this exact opportunity!\nYou have an aluminum gun, I see. The same as mine. No Steelpushing to\ninterfere. Just two men and their sidearms.”\n“Uncle…”\n“You’ve dreamed of it, son. The chance to shoot me, no questions asked,\nand not be running afoul of the law. Besides, to the law I’m already dead!\nYour conscience can rest. I won’t give in, and I’m armed. The only way to\nstop me is to shoot me. Let’s do it.”\nWax fingered the Bands of Mourning, and felt himself smiling. “You don’t\nunderstand at all, do you?”\n“Oh, I do. I’ve seen it in you! The hidden hunger of the lawman, wishing\nto be cut free so he can kill. It’s what defines you and your type.”\n“No,” Wax said. He unhooked the holster from his leg, the one that had\nheld his shotgun, and slipped the Bands into its leather pouch. His remaining\nbullets and metal vials followed, leaving him with no metals, save the\naluminum gun.\n“Perhaps I have felt hidden hunger,” Wax said. “But it isn’t what defines\nme.”\n“Oh, and what does?”\nWax tossed the leather holding the Bands out the broken window, then\nslipped his gun into his side holster. “I’ll show you.”\n* * *\nTelsin scrambled in the snow, climbing through it, frantic.\nSuit was an idiot.

That was the first place they’d go to chase him. He\nwas as good as dead.\nToday was a disaster. An unparalleled disaster. Waxillium knew of her\nsubterfuge. The Set was exposed. Their plans were crumbling.\nSomething had to be salvageable. She stumbled to a small clearing in the\nsnow, near the temple entrance, where her people had deposited the skimmer\nthat she and Waxillium had ridden in on. Still functional, hopefully. She\nknew how it worked—she’d watched carefully during their trip. All she\nneeded to do was—\nSomething banged behind her.\nShe blinked at the sudden spray of redness on the snow all around her.\nFlakes of it.\nHer blood.\n“You killed one of my friends today,” a ragged voice said from behind.\n“I’m not going to let you take a second.”\nShe fell to her knees before the craft, then turned her head. Wayne stood\nbehind her in the snow, his face haggard, holding a shotgun.\n“You…” Telsin whispered. “You can’t … guns…”\n“Yeah,” Wayne said, cocking the shotgun. “About that.”\nHe lowered the barrel to her face and fired.\n* * *\nMarasi climbed the previously hidden steps back into the room with the\nbroken glass and the ornate pedestal. She didn’t know what had opened this\nhidden path, but she was glad for it. Ever blunt, Waxillium had simply\nripped himself a hole out of the catacombs, going straight up through the\nstone—half this chamber had collapsed as a result—but following his route\nwould have been an arduous climb.\nThe power was gone. She’d handed it over to Waxillium, but instead of\nfeeling deflated, she felt … peaceful. Hers was the serenity of a woman\nwho’d lain stretched out on a perfect summer day, feeling the sun as it\nslowly sank. Yes, the light was gone now, but oh what a joy it had been.\nPoor MeLaan was still here, and her form had started to incorporate the\nbones, slowly assembling them in a strange configuration. With no spikes,\nshe’d become a mistwraith. Marasi knelt beside her, but wasn’t certain what\ncomfort she could offer. At the very least, MeLaan seemed to still be alive.\nMarasi rose, then hurried down the hallway with the traps, reaching the\nentryway with the murals. Outside, a war was going on, hundreds of\ngunshots echoing in the cold, snow-filled night. She was surprised to see that\nthe people in masks seemed to be winning. The soldiers had been pushed\nback to the edge of the stone field, their backs to a series of gulfs and cliffs.\nThey had nowhere to retreat, and many of their number lay dead or\nwounded.\nShe thought she saw Waxillium’s influence in the way some of those\nbodies lay, as if tossed through the air to land crumpled.

No Allomancy.\nI win.”\nWax grunted, clinging tight to Suit as they rolled. “You forget,” he said.\n“I’m not surprised. You’ve always hated it. I’m a Terrisman, Uncle.”\nHe increased his weight manyfold.\nHe tapped everything he had in his arm bracer, hundreds of hours spent\nbeing lighter than he should have been. He brought it all out in one moment\nof desperation.\nThe airship lurched. And then the floor shattered.\nWax clung to Suit as they fell, holding him tight, though one hand was\nweakening from the gunshot.

She’d surrendered her medallion to one of\nthe Malwish people until more could be secured from the airship.\nAnd its recovery was an interesting sight to say the least. Waxillium stood\non the rocky section before the plateau, heaving with two hands and Pulling\non nothing visible. Up ahead, the rogue airship slowly sank through the\nsnow-filled sky, drawn toward Waxillium on an invisible tether.\n“Will it break apart?” Allik asked.\nShe looked at him with surprise, then down at his language medallion.\n“Warm choc and a blanket will do me for a minute,” he said, settling\ndown and pulling his blanket around him. “Others are in greater need, yah?\nThe ship. Will it break?”\nMarasi looked up toward it. She could imagine Suit’s people aboard,\ntrying desperately to make the engines work harder, the fans blow more\npowerfully. It sank anyway.

Waxillium held it in place, then raised the Bands of Mourning\nin one hand, winds, snows, and even traces of mist swirling around him.\nThe fans slowly powered down. A short time later, soldiers exited with\nhands up. Wayne and MeLaan scurried up to them, gathering weapons while\nAllik’s people boarded the ship to secure it and search for anyone lurking\ninside.\nMarasi waited through it all, sipping her melted chocolate and thinking.\nReLuur’s spike lay safely wrapped in a handkerchief, tucked into her pocket.\nIn her mind’s eye, she saw Wayne again as he had been, trudging through the\nsnow, gun to his shoulder, a pattern of frozen blood flaking his skin.\nAlongside this image was the glee with which Waxillium had launched into\nthe sky to chase down his uncle.\nThere was a darkness to these men that the stories hadn’t conveyed.\nMarasi was glad for it, but she had stepped to that ledge, then turned back.\nProud though she was of having fulfilled her mission for the kandra, she had\ndecided that things would be different for her in the future. She was all right\nwith that.\nIt was what she had chosen.\n“Frosts,” Allik said after some time. “We’d better go do something, yah?”\nShe looked up from her now-empty canteen of chocolate to follow Allik’s\ngesture. The Malwish airship crew had returned from their inspection, and\nthe enemy soldiers had been led away—to be safely locked in the ship’s brig,\nMarasi believed.\nSuit was still where Waxillium had put him: tied to the top of the Lord\nRuler’s spear, feet dangling. He’d been gagged, he’d had his metalminds\nremoved, and Waxillium had used Allomancy to leech away his metals. And\nthis still seemed like it might not be cautious enough. He still had his spikes,\nas they weren’t sure how to remove them without killing him. He shouldn’t"

He shouldn’t\nbe able to do anything without metals, but she couldn’t help being worried.\nSteris had joined Waxillium on the field, and he’d put his arm around her\nshoulders. Marasi smiled. Now that was an image she’d never thought she’d\nfind comforting. But they would do well together.\nUnfortunately, trouble approached Waxillium and Steris in the form of\nAllik’s captain and some of her airmen. The two groups faced one another,\nMeLaan and Wayne falling in beside Waxillium—Wayne casually carrying\nthat shotgun, MeLaan standing a good two inches taller than anyone else,\narms folded, her posture unyielding.\nRight. “Let’s go,” Marasi said to Allik.\nAllik’s captain, Jordis, wore one of the translation medallions—and she\ndidn’t flinch before the gust of wind that accompanied Marasi as she arrived.\n“We thank you for your help,” Jordis was saying, her voice touched by the\nsame accent Allik had. “But our appreciation does not allow us to ignore\nthievery. We expect that our property will be returned.”\n“I don’t see any of your property here,” Waxillium replied coldly. “I see\nonly an artifact we recovered. Well, that and my airship.”\n“Your—” Jordis sputtered. She stepped forward. “Since crashing in your\nlands, my crew has been incarcerated, tortured, and murdered. You seem to\nbe itching for a war, Allomancer.”\nDrat. Marasi had been hoping she’d share Allik’s reverence for Waxillium.\nIndeed, much of the crew seemed nervous about him, but the captain\nobviously didn’t mean to back down.\n“If there is to be war,” Waxillium said, “giving you a powerful weapon\ndoes not seem the method to save my people. I cannot help what Suit and his\npeople did to you—they are outlaws, and what they did was deplorable. I\nwill see them brought to justice.”\n“And yet you steal from us.”\n“Do you deny,” Waxillium asked, “that this temple was empty upon my\narrival? Do you deny that this airship was from nation other than your own?\nI cannot steal what was not owned, Captain. By right of salvage, I claim this\nrelic and that ship. You may—”\nMarasi was about to step between them when, curiously, Steris spoke up,\ninterrupting Wax.\n“Lord Waxillium,” she said. “I think it prudent to let them take the ship.”\n“What? Like hell I’m going to—”\n“Waxillium,” Steris said softly. “They’re tired, miserable, and a long way\nfrom home. How do you suggest, otherwise, that they are to return to those\nthey love? Is that justice?”\nHis lips tightened. “The Set has one of these ships to study, Steris.”\n“Then,” Steris said, looking to Jordis, “we will beg—in return for the\ngenerosity of this gift—that the Malwish people open trade with us. I suspect\nwe can purchase ships from them more quickly than the Set can build their\nown.”\nMarasi nodded. Not bad, Steris."

Not bad, Steris.\n“If they’ll sell,” Waxillium said.\n“I think that they will,” Steris said, looking to Jordis. “Because the good\ncaptain will persuade them that access to our Allomancers is worth\nrelinquishing a technological monopoly.”\n“That’s true,” Marasi said, stepping up to the rest, Allik with her. “We’re\nrare among you, aren’t we?”\n“We?” Allik asked as the captain looked to her.\n“I’m an Allomancer too,” she said, amused. “You didn’t see me charging\nthe cube device back in the warehouse?”\n“I was … a little distracted.…” he said, sounding woozy. “Oh dear. Um.\nGreat One.”\nMarasi sighed, looking to Jordis.\n“I can promise you nothing,” the captain said to Steris, sounding reluctant.\n“The Malwish are but one of many. Another nation among us may see you\nup here as weak and decide to strike.”\n“Then,” Steris said, “you might want to inform them that the Bands of\nMourning are here, ready to punish those who attack.”\nJordis hissed. Marasi couldn’t see her features behind the mask, but the\nhand swipe she made did not look pleased. “Impossible. You give me the\nlesser prize to distract me from the greater, yah? We will not give you the\nSovereign’s weapon.”\n“You’re not giving it to us,” Steris said. She looked to MeLaan, who\nwatched with crossed arms. “Allik. Your people have stories of creatures like\nher, do you not?”\n“Tell the others,” Marasi said to Allik. “Please.”\nHe removed his medallion and launched into a furious explanation in his\nlanguage, waving his hands, then gesturing at MeLaan. She cocked an\neyebrow, then made her skin translucent—displaying a skeleton that was so\ncracked and mangled, Marasi was left momentarily stunned. How was\nMeLaan still standing?\nThe captain took this in.\n“We,” Steris said, “will give the Bands to the immortal kandra. They are\nwise and impartial, tasked with serving all people. They will promise not to\nlet us use the Bands unless we are attacked by your kind.”\nThere was no way to tell what Captain Jordis thought, her expression\nhidden behind that mask. When she did speak, she made a few curt gestures\n—but those could be faked far more easily than facial expressions, Marasi\nfigured. What did one make of a society where everyone hid their true\nfeelings behind a mask, only letting out calculated reactions?\n“This is an unpleasant accommodation,” Jordis said. “It means I will limp\nback to my people, half my crew dead and my ship exchanged for one\ndecades out of date.”\n“True,” Steris continued at Waxillium’s side—he merely stood there with\narms folded, looming, as he was so good at doing. “But Captain, you will\nreturn with something more valuable than an old relic or even your fallen\nship. You’ll have new trading partners in a land brimming with Metalborn."

You’ll have new trading partners in a land brimming with Metalborn.\nHas it been mentioned that my lord Waxillium holds an important seat in our\ngovernment? That he has a dramatic influence over trade, tariffs, and\ntaxation? Those among your people who secure favorable treaties with us\ncould become very rich indeed.”\nJordis regarded them, then folded her arms, facing Waxillium directly. “It\nis still unpleasant.” Jordis was much shorter, but she managed to loom pretty\nwell herself. In fact, Marasi got the distinct impression that the woman\nwanted to shout at them, attack in a rage, seek retribution for what had been\ndone to her and hers. Anything but just simply trade.\nPerhaps some emotions were too strong to be hidden even by a mask.\nJordis finally nodded. “Very well. Let it be done. But I will not leave\nwithout a draft agreement—a promise of intentions, if nothing else.”\nMarasi breathed a sigh of relief, shooting Steris a nod of appreciation.\nStill, she did not miss the stiffness in Jordis’s posture as she and Waxillium\nshook hands. The Basin had not made a friend this day. Hopefully some last-\nminute scrambling had prevented them from making an enemy.\n“I have one further request,” Waxillium said to her.\n“What?” Jordis asked, suspicious.\n“Nothing terrible or costly,” Waxillium said. “Honestly, I’d just like a\nride.”\n* * *\nThe Southerners agreed, fortunately. They didn’t particularly want to carry a\nbrigful of enemy soldiers all the way south. Wax had to make it very clear\nthey couldn’t keep Suit himself, and the captain relented with minimal\nargument. She seemed to realize that her best chance of seeing justice done\nto all of those who had brutalized her crew lay in letting Wax do some\nthorough interrogations.\nHe kept his relationship to the man quiet.\nAs the Malwish crew prepared the ship for travel, Wax stood before the\nstatue of the Lord Ruler, with that single spike in his eye. He’d checked the\nbelt, which was aluminum. No kind of charge. If there had ever been two\nbracers, he had to assume they’d been made into this one spearhead.\nMarasi passed behind him. “I’m going to go check our skimmer for\nsupplies we might have left behind.”\nWax nodded. I held your power, he thought toward the statue, if only a\ntiny bit of it. Rusts … I think I understand.\nHe’d given the Bands to MeLaan, and she had made them vanish into her\nflesh. He was glad to know that they were effectively out of his reach. Too\nmuch power.\nHe raised his finger in farewell to the Lord Ruler, then jogged off after\nMarasi.\n“Aradel and the Senate won’t like this deal,” Wax noted as he reached her.\n“Particularly the part about us giving away the Bands.”\n“I know,” Marasi said.\n“As long as I can tell him it wasn’t my idea.”\nShe glanced at him. “You don’t seem too broken up about losing the\nBands.”\n“I’m not,” he admitted. “I was worried, honestly. The Bands are drained,\nmostly, but we could probably recharge them by compounding. The power\nthey offer is something…”"

The power\nthey offer is something…”\n“… Sublime and devastating at once?” Marasi asked. “Dangerous because\nof what it could do in the wrong hands, yet somehow more dangerous in\nyour own?”\n“Yes.”\nThey shared something in that moment, swept by winds. Something\nthey’d touched, something—hopefully—only they would know.\nThey turned together without a word, seeking the skimmer. Jordis would\nwant to load it on the ship, but first there was a corpse Wax needed to see.\nHe didn’t blame Wayne for what he’d done to Telsin. Yes, taking her to\nElendel for justice—and interrogation—would have been better. And yes, he\nfound that he’d rather have pulled the trigger himself. Harmony was right\nabout that.\nBut either way, Telsin was dealt with. That meant—\nBlood on the snow.\nNo skimmer.\nMore importantly, no body.\nMarasi froze in place as they drew near, but Wax approached the empty\npatch of ground. She had slipped away, again. He found he was not\nsurprised, though he was impressed. She’d gotten the skimmer aloft and\naway during the fighting, escaping during the chaos.\nWayne should have known she might be able to heal herself, Wax thought,\ngoing down on one knee beside the eerie pattern of blood drops that seemed\nto outline a body.\n“It’s not done, then,” Marasi said.\nWax brushed the drops of blood, frozen to the ground. He’d spent the last\neighteen months trying to save this woman. And when he finally had, she’d\nkilled him.\n“It’s not done,” he said. “But in some ways, that’s better.”\n“Because your sister isn’t dead?”\nHe turned toward Marasi. It seemed that despite hours in this frozen place,\nthe cold had only just reached inside of him.\n“No,” he said. “Because now I have someone to hunt.”\n31\n“Wax, you gotta see this!”\nWax tipped his head back, bleary-eyed. These bunks were not particularly\npleasant, but at least the airship flew in a calm, smooth manner. That was\nnice, as the skimmer had always felt as if it were one gust of wind away\nfrom plowing nose-first into a hillside.\nWayne hung halfway out of the room’s large window.\n“That window opens?” Wax asked, surprised.\n“Any window opens,” Wayne said, “if you push hard enough. Look,\nyou’ve gotta see this.”\nWax sighed, climbing up and leaning out of the window beside Wayne.\nBeneath them, Elendel spread out as a vast sea of lights.\n“Like rivers of fire,” Wayne mumbled. “Look how it follows patterns.\nRich areas more lit, roads all in lines. Beautiful.”\nWax grunted.\n“That’s all you can say, mate?”\n“Wayne, I see this basically every night.”\n“Now, that there, that ain’t fair. You should feel guilty.”\n“For being a Coinshot?”\n“For cheatin’ at life, Wax.”\n“How about I feel appreciative instead?”\n“Suppose that’ll do.”"

        "text": "“For being a Coinshot?”\n“For cheatin’ at life, Wax.”\n“How about I feel appreciative instead?”\n“Suppose that’ll do.”\nWax settled down on his bunk, then pulled on his boots, doing the laces.\nHe ached like a man beaten senseless. He wished he could blame the strain\nof the last few days, but he’d held the Bands of Mourning and had been\nhealed completely.\nThat meant these aches came merely from sleeping a few hours on this\nbunk. Rusts. He was getting old. Upon considering that, however, he found\nthat mortality didn’t frighten him as it once had.\n“We should get up to the bridge,” he suggested, standing. It had been a\nfull day since they’d left the mountains. They’d stopped at a town to\ntelegraph ahead at Wax’s insistence, then waited until the next night to fly\nthe rest of the way. He had had no intention of bringing a massive flying\nwarship anywhere near the city without at least giving warning first.\nJordis had been amenable, once he’d promised her supplies for their trip\nhome in repayment. Marasi worried about the captain, he knew, but he had\nlooked into the woman’s eyes behind the mask. She was a soldier, a killer,\ndespite her claims of hers being a simple trading vessel.\nShe knew. Wax had held the Bands. He could have swept the Malwish\naway and stolen their ship without a second thought. Instead, he’d given in\nto Steris’s compromise. Strong words notwithstanding, Jordis realized she’d\ngotten more out of this deal than she had any reason to expect.\nWayne joined him outside their room, and they stepped aside as a few\nwearied airmen passed. He couldn’t see their faces, but could read a world of\nemotions from their hunched backs and subdued speech.\n“They’ve been broken,” Wayne whispered, looking over his shoulder as\nthe airmen continued on. “Ain’t fair what happened to these folks, Wax.”\n“Is life ever fair?”\n“It has been to me,” Wayne said. “More than fair, I reckon. Considering\nwhat I deserve.”\n“Do you want to talk about it?” Wax asked.\n“What?”\n“You used a gun, Wayne.”\n“Bah, that was a shotgun. Barely counts.”\nWax rested a hand on his friend’s shoulder.\nWayne shrugged. “Guess my body figured, ‘What the hell?’”\n“I thought it meant you’d forgiven yourself.”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “I was just real mad at your sister.”\n“You knew, didn’t you?” Wax asked, frowning. “That she’d heal?”\n“Well, I didn’t wanna kill someone in cold blood—”\n“That’s good, I suppose.”\n“—but there weren’t no fire around to light her with first.”\n“Wayne…”\nThe shorter man sighed. “I saw the metalminds peekin’ outta her sleeves.\nFigured, if you’re gonna give yourself one power from a Feruchemist, you’d\nwanna be able to heal. I ain’t gonna kill your sister, mate. But I didn’t mind\nmakin’ her jump a bit, and I needed MeLaan’s spikes.”\nWayne’s gaze grew distant. “Shoulda stayed there, I suppose. To stop her"

But I wasn’t of sound mind, so to speak. I thought\nyou were dead, mate. Really thought it. And I kept thinkin’ to myself,\n‘Would Wax kill her for real? Or would he give her another chance, like he\ngave me?’ So I let her be. I stayed my hand, ’cuz it was the last thing I could\ndo for you. Does that make sense?”\nWax squeezed Wayne’s shoulder. “Thank you. I’m glad you’re learning.”\nIt felt disingenuous to say that when inside, in truth, he wished Wayne had\nstripped off her metalminds and left her a frozen corpse.\nWayne grinned. Wax nodded in the direction the airmen had gone. “I’ll\nmeet you up there.”\n“Going to go fetch your woman?” Wayne said. “She’s gonna have a hard\ntime adjustin’ to life back here, away from her native habitat of the frozen,\nicy, desolate wastes up—”\n“Wayne,” Wax interrupted, soft but firm.\n“Hum?”\n“Enough.”\n“I was just—”\n“Enough.”\nWayne stopped with his mouth open, then licked his lips and nodded.\n“Right, then. See you up above in a few, mate?”\n“We’ll be right along.”\nWayne scampered off toward the bridge. Wax trailed through the hallway,\nheading down several doors to the room Steris and Marasi had been sharing.\nHe raised his hand to knock, but it was cracked, so he peeked in. Steris lay\non a bunk, wrapped in a blanket, sleeping softly. There was no sign of\nMarasi; she’d mentioned wanting to watch the approach to the city from the\nbridge.\nHe hesitated at the door, watching her sleep. He almost left; she’d been\nthrough so much these last few days. She had to be exhausted. Once they\nreached Elendel, they’d still have to unload the prisoners and bring the\nsupplies on board—it could be hours before the ship had to leave. She could\nsleep a little longer, couldn’t she?\nThe door creaked as he leaned against it, and Steris started awake. Her\neyes found him immediately. Then she smiled, relaxing, and huddled up\nagainst her pillow. She was wearing a travel dress under the blanket.\nWax stepped into the room and took a seat on the bunk across from Steris;\nthere was so little space in this room that his knees touched her bunk after he\nsat. And these were the rooms the airmen considered large. He leaned\nforward, taking Steris’s hand in his.\nShe squeezed it, eyes closed once more, and they sat there. Still. Everyone\nelse could wait a few minutes.\n“Thank you,” Wax said softly.\n“For what?” she said.\n“Coming with me.”\n“I didn’t do much.”\n“You were extremely helpful at the party,” Wax said. “And your\nnegotiations with the Malwish … Steris, that was incredible.”\n“Perhaps,” she said. “But I still feel that I was basically luggage for most\nof the trip.”\nHe shrugged. “Steris, I think we’re all like that.

        "text": "“Perhaps,” she said. “But I still feel that I was basically luggage for most\nof the trip.”\nHe shrugged. “Steris, I think we’re all like that. Shuffled from place to\nplace by duty, or society, or God Himself. It seems like we’re just along for\nthe ride, even in our own lives. But once in a while, we do face a choice. A\nreal one. We may not be able to choose what happens to us, or where we’ll\nstop, but we point ourselves in a direction.” He squeezed her hand. “You\npointed yourself toward me.”\n“Well,” she said, smiling, “being near you is generally the safest place.…”\nHe cupped her face with his hand, all callused and rough. Another\nadventure.\nEventually, an airman came looking for them, and Wax reluctantly stood,\nhelping Steris up. Then they walked—arm in arm—through the hallways of\nthe ship and up to the bridge, where the others waited.\nHere, Wax was able to appreciate what Wayne had seen. With the\npanoramic view from the bridge, the city really was gorgeous at night. Is this\na sight that will become commonplace? Wax thought as Steris squeezed his\narm, grinning at the sight. This airship technology was new, but not many\nyears had passed since he’d seen his first motorcar on the road.\nMarasi had been directing Captain Jordis through the city. Wax couldn’t\nread anything in the captain’s posture, or those of her crew. Were they\nimpressed by the size of the city and the height of the skyscrapers? Or were\nthese things commonplace in the South?\nThey approached Ahlstrom Tower, and Wax could only imagine the\nstories this would prompt in the broadsheets the next morning. Good. He\nhated subterfuge; let the people of Elendel know, to a man, that the world\nhad just become a much larger place.\nAhlstrom Tower, in which Wax had an ownership interest, had a flat top.\nThe captain had assured him that she could land her ship “on a nail, so long\nas the head is smooth enough.” True to her word, they set it down.\n“You’re certain you don’t want to stay?” Marasi asked Jordis. “Visit our\ncity, find out what we’re actually like?”\n“No. Thank you.” The words sounded forced, to Wax. But who was to say,\nwith the accent muddying things? “We will take your offer of supplies and\nbe away tonight.”\nTime to debark. Together—the others filing after—Wax and Steris made\ntheir way through the halls again.\n“It almost feels,” Steris said softly, “like this entire experience was a\ndream. I need to write it all down quickly, lest it fade.”\nWax found himself nodding as he thought of his meeting with Harmony.\nThe hallway led to a junction where the wall had opened and a long\ndocking bridge had been settled in place, leading down to the rooftop.\nBelow, Wax picked out several figures craning their necks to look at the ship.\nGovernor Aradel had come in person.\nAllik stood at the door, and he lifted his mask as Wax approached. No\nbow or nod, just the mask lift. Among this people, perhaps that was the same\nthing—as behind him, the other airmen did the same."

Among this people, perhaps that was the same\nthing—as behind him, the other airmen did the same.\n“Mighty One,” Allik said to Wax. “May your next fire be known to you.”\n“And you, Allik.”\n“Oh, it is,” he said with a grin. “For my next fire is home, yah?” He looked\nto Marasi, and then reached up and removed his mask—the broken one,\nwhich he had glued. He held it out with two hands, which caused a few\ngasps behind him.\n“Please,” Allik said. The word had more accent to it than the way he’d\nbeen speaking before.\nThe captain, who had not lifted her mask to Wax, grew stiff at the gesture.\nMarasi hesitated, then accepted the mask. “Thank you.”\n“Thank you, Miss Marasi,” Allik said. “For life.” He took a flat,\nunornamented mask from his waist and pulled it on by the leather strap. It\nwas really nothing more than a curved piece of wood with holes for the eyes.\n“I look forward to my homecoming, but my next fire after that may be here\nagain. I plan to take you up on your offer to visit this city.”\n“So long as you bring some more choc,” Marasi said, “you can visit any\ntime you like.”\nWax smiled, and then the five of them relinquished their weight medallion\nmetalminds to the captain, a formality they’d been instructed was customary.\nJordis had already presented Wax with one of each, translation and heat-\nstoring, as a gift for him to keep. Wayne had likely stolen another set, though\nWax intended to wait until they were off the ship to ask.\nWax led them down the gangway, Steris on his arm.\n“Seriously, Waxillium,” Marasi said, walking up beside them. “You need\nto import that chocolate of theirs. I don’t know what they put in it, but it’s\namazing. You think the airships are going to be big? Wait until you taste this\nstuff.”\n“Hey,” Wayne said, pulling up on his other side, but then twisting his neck\nto look at the people in the ship behind them. “Marasi, I think that pilot\nfellow fancies you.”\n“Thank you,” Marasi said, “for lending us your brilliant powers of\nobservation, Wayne.”\n“That could be useful politically,” Steris noted.\n“Please,” Marasi said. “He’s practically a child compared to me. And\ndon’t you snicker.”\n“I wouldn’t dare,” Wax said, eyes ahead. He didn’t miss how reverently\nMarasi carried the mask, however.\nAhead, a group of the governor’s aides and guards clustered together in a\nprotective bubble, as if they could stave off the weirdness before them—and\nwhat it represented—through collective body heat. Aradel himself stood\napart, as if he’d pushed out of the group.\nWax strolled up to him, Steris on his arm, and waited.\n“Damn,” Aradel finally said.\n“I did warn you,” Wax replied.\nAradel shook his head in awe, eyes wide. “Well, maybe this will distract\neveryone from the disaster you all started in New Seran.”\n“Bad?” Steris asked."

As if I ever had any\ninfluence over you people.” He started, finally ripping his gaze from the\nairship, and coughed—as if realizing what he’d just said, and whom he’d\nsaid it to.\nWax smiled. Aradel was blunt, but usually displayed more tact than this.\nYou couldn’t go far as a constable without some understanding of how to\ndeal with people’s egos.\n“Apologies, Lady Harms,” he said. “Ladrian, I need to hear what\nhappened in New Seran. The honest truth of it, from your own mouth.”\n“You’ll have it,” Wax promised. “Tomorrow.”\n“But—”\n“Governor,” Wax said. “I appreciate your position, but you have no idea\nwhat we’ve been through these last few days. My people need rest.\nTomorrow. Please.”\nAradel grunted. “Fine.”\n“Did you prepare the thing I requested?” Wax asked.\n“It’s below,” Aradel said, turning back toward the airship. “In the\npenthouse.” The governor took a deep breath, looking at that enormous\nairship again. Constable-General Reddi had led a group of constables up to\naccept the transfer of prisoners.\nWax could now see that the ship had landed only half on the building. One\nfan spun lazily, keeping the ship in place. Likely done that way on purpose,\nhe thought of the landing, as a message. The crew wants to remind us that\nwhile we might get this technology soon, we’ll still be many years behind\nthem in its use.\n“I think we’ll be fine,” Wax said to Aradel. “If the outer cities had\nthoughts about attacking us, I suspect this might stall them. Spread the\nknowledge that an airship flew through central Elendel and let me off—then\nleft peaceably.”\n“We have initial treaties in place, Your Honor,” Steris added. “Favorable\nto us for trade. That should give the hawks pause, and could buy us time to\nsmooth things over.”\n“Yes, perhaps,” Aradel said. “It’s going to be a tough metal for the Senate\nto swallow though, Ladrian. Not the airship itself, but the fact that I’m—\napparently—just going to let it fly off.” He hesitated. “I haven’t told them\nwhat you said about the other item.”\n“Bands of Mourning?” Wax said.\nAradel nodded, too politic to say what Wax was certain he was thinking.\nWhat have you gone and done to me this time, Ladrian?\n“MeLaan?” Wax asked. “Would you mind taking over here?”\n“Sure,” she said, striding toward them. She wore an outfit borrowed from\nthe Southlanders, a man’s breeches and boots that went up to midcalf. She\nrested an arm on the governor’s shoulder.\n“Holy One,” Aradel said, his voice strained but reverent. He eyed Wax.\n“You realize precisely how unfair it is to deal with you, when you can fall"

He needs practice being\nthrown off balance in conversations. Helps him prepare for debates and\nsuch.”\nShe eyed him.\n“I’ll be better,” he promised, holding the door open for her. Marasi moved\nto join them, but Wayne caught her by the arm and shook his head.\n“Better?” Steris asked from the stairwell. “So this means no more\ncomplaining about parties.”\n“Of course I’ll gripe,” Wax said, following her into the stairwell, leaving\nthe others behind. “It’s a defining character feature. But I’ll try and confine\nthe worst of it to you and Wayne.”\n“And I,” Steris said, “shall promise to be properly amazed by your\nexploits saving everyone from everything.” She smiled at him. “And to\nalways carry a few vials of metal with me, just in case. By the way, where\nare we going?”\nHe grinned, guiding her down to the top floor of the skyscraper, a regal\npenthouse that—currently—was unoccupied, the tenants having moved to\nElmsdel for an extended holiday. Seated in a chair in the hall outside the\napartment proper was a tired-looking man in the garb of a Survivorist priest,\nhis formal mistcloak—really more of a shawl—worn over robes adorned\nwith stitching up the sleeves representing scars.\nSteris looked to Wax, curious.\n“I was wondering, Steris,” Wax said, “if you’d be willing to be my bride.”\n“I’ve already agreed—”\n“Yes, but last time I asked with an expectation of a contract,” Wax said.\n“It was the lord of a house asking a woman of means for a union. Well, that\nrequest stands, and thank you. But I’m asking again. It’s important to me.\n“Will you be my bride? I want to be married to you. Right now, before the\nSurvivor and that priest. Not because words on a paper say we have to, but\nbecause we want to.” He took her by the hand, and spoke more softly. “I’m\npainfully tired of being alone, Steris. It’s time I admitted that. And you …\nwell, you’re incredible. You truly are.”\nSteris started sniffling. She pulled her hand free of his and wiped her eyes.\n“Is that … good crying or bad?” Wax asked. All these years dealing with\nwomen, and he still couldn’t tell the difference sometimes.\n“Well, this wasn’t on any of my lists, you see.”\n“Ah.” He felt his heart lurch.\n“And,” she continued, “I can’t remember a time when I missed something\nfor one of my lists, only to have it be so wonderful.” She nodded, red-nosed\nand sniffly. “And it is.

I mean, if you’re tired from\nthe trip, don’t let me pressure you. I just thought—”\nIn response, she kissed him.\nEPILOGUE\nMarasi found it invigorating to work by candlelight. Perhaps it was the\nprimordial danger of it. Electric lights felt safe, contained, harnessed—but\nan open flame, well, that was something raw. Alive. A little spark of fury\nwhich, if released, could destroy her and everything she worked on.\nShe worked with a lot of such sparks these days.\nSpread on her desk in the octant constabulary headquarters were notes,\nfiles, interviews. She’d been present for most of them over the last two\nweeks, advising Constable-General Reddi. The two of them worked so\nclosely these days, it was sometimes hard to remember how difficult he’d\nbeen to her during her early days in the constabulary.\nThough Suit himself hadn’t broken, many of his men had talked. They\nknew just enough to be infuriating. They’d been recruited from among the\ndissident young men of the outer cities—their ears stuffed with stories of the\nSurvivor and his fight against imperial rule. They’d been trained in cities like\nRashekin and Bilming, far from central rule. In closed compounds that were\nmuch more extensive than anyone had known.\nAradel and the others had focused on these details. Troops, timetables,\ntechnology—like the long-distance speaking device Waxillium had stolen\nfrom Lady Kelesina’s mansion. They geared up for war, all the while talking\npeace.\nThey were scared, and legitimately so. Decades of not-so-benign neglect\nhad created this snarl. Hopefully it could still be peacefully untangled.\nMarasi left that to politicians. She cut through the jingoism, the rhetoric, and\nturned her attention to something else. Stories among the men of something\nunusual, beyond the rumors of airships and new Allomantic metals.\nShe held up one sheet covered in notes. Half mentions, admissions made\nwith sideways glances, always spoken of in whispers. Tales of men with red\neyes who visited in the night. She added the stories to her files of research\nabout Trell, the ancient god that people were somehow worshipping again. A\ngod that had crafted spikes to corrupt the kandra Paalm, and whose name\nwas on the lips of many of the prisoners.\nShe’d spent months researching, and so far felt like she knew nothing. But\nshe would find answers, one way or another.\n* * *\nSuit’s captors thought to shock him with the austerity of his quarters. A\ncommon cell in the prison’s nethers, with a bucket for facilities and one\nblanket on the bed. A tired, pointless tactic.

He would not break, and they would see.\nSo it was that he wasn’t at all surprised when, after two weeks of\ncaptivity, the door to the corridor outside his cell clicked open one night and\na stranger stalked in. Male this time, with a ragged beard and wild hair. A\nbeggar stolen off the street, Suit guessed.\nYou could tell them by the way they walked. Never a stroll, never\nleisurely. Always fast, determined. Purposeful.\nOf course, the softly glowing red eyes were another sign. So far as Suit\nhad been able to determine, Waxillium and his fools had no knowledge of\nthese creatures. They didn’t understand, couldn’t understand.\nThe Set had Faceless Immortals of its own.\nSuit stood, pulling down the sleeves of his prisoner’s jumpsuit and\nswiping the wrinkles from his shoulders. “Two weeks is longer than I\nexpected.”\n“Our timeline is not yours.”\n“I was not complaining,” Suit said. “Merely observing. I am perfectly\nwilling to wait upon Trell’s pleasure.”\n“Are you?” the Immortal asked. “It is our understanding that you push for\nan acceleration.”\n“I was merely stating my perspective,” Suit said. “So that a proper\ndiscourse can be engaged.”\nThe creature studied him through the bars. “You didn’t break or spill\nsecrets.”\n“I did not.”\n“We are impressed.”\n“Thank you.”\nAdvantage. Even two weeks in prison can be used to prove a point.\n“The timeline will be accelerated, as you have requested,” the Immortal\nsaid.\n“Excellent!”\nThe creature reached into its pocket and removed a device like a small\npackage wrapped in wires. One of Irich’s early attempts at creating an\nexplosive device from the metal that powered the airships. It had proven\nineffective, barely more explosive than dynamite, when they needed\nsomething that could end cities.\n“What is that?” Suit asked, growing nervous.\n“Our accelerated pace will no longer require the Set to have its full\nhierarchy.”\n“But you need us!” Suit said. “To rule, to manage civilization on—”\n“No longer. Recent advances have made civilization here too dangerous.\nAllowing it to continue risks further advances we cannot control, and so we\nhave decided to remove life on this sphere instead. Thank you for your\nservice; it has been accepted. You will be allowed to serve in another\nRealm.”\n“But—”\nThe creature engaged the explosive device, blowing itself—and Suit—to\noblivion.\n* * *\nWax started awake. Had that been an explosion?\nHe looked around the quiet bedroom suite of the tower penthouse. Steris\ncurled up on the bed next to him, perfectly still in her sleep, though she held\nlightly to his arm. She often did that, as if afraid to let go and risk all this\nending.\nLooking at her there in the starlight, he was shocked by the deep affection\nhe felt for her. His surprise didn’t concern him. He could remember many a\nmorning waking next to Lessie, feeling that same surprise. Amazement at his\ngood fortune, astonishment at the depth of his own emotion."

Amazement at his\ngood fortune, astonishment at the depth of his own emotion.\nHe gently lifted her hand away, then pulled the sheet up around her before\nslipping from the bed and strolling bare-chested across the room toward the\nbalcony.\nThey’d stayed here in the penthouse through the honeymoon, rather than\nreturning to the mansion. It felt like a good way to have a new beginning,\nand Wax was starting to think he might like to relocate here more\npermanently. He was a new person for what seemed like the hundredth time\nin his life, and this was a new age. This was no longer an era of quiet\nmansions and smoking-room conversations; it was an era of bold\nskyscrapers and vibrant downtown politics.\nThe mists were out, curling around outside, though the skyscraper was tall\nenough he thought he could see stars and the Red Rip through that mist. He\nmoved to push open the doors and step out onto the balcony, but paused,\nnoticing his dressing table, upon which Drewton had set out a row of\nobjects. The valet had gone through Wax’s things, from his pockets and from\nhis possessions recovered from the hotel in New Seran. Drewton probably\nwanted to know which should be kept, and which disposed of.\nWax smiled, brushing his fingers over the wrinkled cravat he’d worn to\nthe party with Steris. He remembered tossing it to the ground as he changed\nto trousers and mistcoat in his room, prior to their quick escape from the city.\nDrewton had laid it out, along with a napkin from the party, monogrammed,\nand even a bottle cap he’d swiped in case he needed something to Push on.\nBut Drewton had set it out on its own little cloth as if it might be the most\nimportant thing in the world.\nWax shook his head, resting a hand on the door out to the balcony. Then\nhe froze and looked back at the table.\nIt was right there. The coin he’d been given by the beggar, shining in the\nfaint starlight. Drewton must have found it in his pocket. Wax reached out,\nhesitated a moment, and then slipped it from the table before stepping out\ninto the mist.\nCould it be? he wondered, holding up the coin. Two different metals. One\nwas silvery. Could that be nicrosil? The other was copper. A Feruchemical\nmetal. Though the pattern printed on the face wasn’t the same, and the coin\nitself was smaller, this didn’t look all that different from one of the\nSoutherner medallions.\nAs soon as he thought of it—as soon as he knew what it might do—the\nmetalmind started working, and he found a store within him, a reserve he\ncould tap. Wax gasped.\nThey called them copperminds. A very special kind of Feruchemical\nstorage. One that stored memories.\nHe tapped it.\nImmediately, Wax was in a different place. A barren land, with no one in\nsight and only dust blowing around him. It was a difficult perspective to\nexperience, for only half of the viewer’s eyesight was normal.\nThe other was all in blue, lines everywhere. The vision of a man spiked\nthrough the eye."

The vision of a man spiked\nthrough the eye.\nThe figure crossed those desolate reaches, passing half-tended crops left to\ndie and rattle in the wind. Ahead lay a town—or the remnants of one.\nHe heard his own boots on the dirty rock, the wind blowing, and felt cold.\nHe continued on into the town, passing foundations marked by old, burned-\nout fires. Somehow, he knew that the inhabitants here—as in other villages\nand towns he’d passed—had torn down their own walls for firewood, in\ndesperation to survive.\nBodies lay in the street, stripped. Their clothing had been taken for\nburning after they’d frozen in what most men would consider only mildly\ncold weather.\nAhead stood a bunkerlike stone dwelling. Long and narrow, it reminded\nhim of something—not something Wax knew, but a memory in the mind of\nthe man storing this experience. A memory of something long ago that\nflickered in his consciousness, then was lost in a moment.\nThe traveler continued, stepping up to the doorway, which was open.\nThey’d burned the door.\nInside, a mass of people huddled together for warmth, wrapped uselessly\nin blankets. No fires left.\nThey’d burned even their masks.\nThe traveler moved among them, drawing some concern, though most\npeople stared with dull eyes. Awaiting death. He found the leaders near the\ncenter, the elders, aged and wearing cloth masks on their faces—the only\nthings they had left. One ancient woman looked up at him and lifted her\nmask.\nHe saw her normally in one world, and outlined in blue in another. The\ntraveler reached out and took the woman by the shoulder, kneeled down, and\nwhispered a single word.\nWax came out of that memory with a shock, dropping the coin, startled\nand stepping back.\nThe coin plinged against the balcony and settled to a stop near his feet.\nThat arm … That arm. Lined with a network of scars layered atop one\nanother, as if made by scraping the skin time and time again.

Mistings who can burn aluminum are called Aluminum Gnats\ndue to the ineffectiveness of this ability by itself. Trueself Ferrings can\nstore their spiritual sense of identity in an aluminum metalmind. This is\nan art rarely spoken of outside of Terris communities, and even among\nthem it is not yet well understood. Aluminum itself and a few of its\nalloys are Allomantically inert; they cannot be Pushed or Pulled and can\nbe used to shield an individual from emotional Allomancy.\nSlider Mistings burn bendalloy to compress time in a bubble\nBENDALLOY:\naround themselves, making it pass more quickly within the bubble. This\ncauses events outside the bubble to move at a glacial pace from the point\nof view of the Slider. Subsumer Ferrings can store nutrition and calories\nin a bendalloy metalmind; they can eat large amounts of food during\nactive storage without feeling full or gaining weight, and then can go\nwithout the need to eat while tapping the metalmind. A separate\nbendalloy metalmind can be used to similarly regulate fluids intake.\nSoother Mistings burn brass to Soothe (dampen) the emotions of\nBRASS:\nnearby individuals. This can be directed at a single individual or directed\nacross a general area, and the Soother can focus on specific emotions.\nFiresoul Ferrings can store warmth in a brass metalmind, cooling\nthemselves off while actively storing. They can tap the metalmind at a\nlater time to warm themselves.\nSeeker Mistings burn bronze to “hear” pulses given off by other\nBRONZE:\nAllomancers who are burning metals. Different metals produce different\npulses. Sentry Ferrings can store wakefulness in a bronze metalmind,\nmaking themselves drowsy while actively storing. They can tap the\nmetalmind at a later time to reduce drowsiness or to heighten their\nawareness.\nPulser Mistings burn cadmium to stretch time in a bubble around\nCADMIUM:\nthemselves, making it pass more slowly inside the bubble. This causes\nevents outside the bubble to move at blurring speed from the point of\nview of the Pulser. Gasper Ferrings can store breath inside a cadmium\nmetalmind; during active storage they must hyperventilate in order for\ntheir bodies to get enough air. The breath can be retrieved at a later time,\neliminating or reducing the need to breathe using the lungs while tapping\nthe metalmind. They can also highly oxygenate their blood.\nLeecher Mistings who burn chromium while touching another\nCHROMIUM:\nAllomancer will wipe that Allomancer’s metal reserves. Spinner\nFerrings can store fortune in a chromium metalmind, making themselves\nunlucky during active storage, and can tap it at a later time to increase\ntheir luck.\nCoppercloud Mistings (a.k.a.

Connecter\nFerrings can store spiritual connection in a duralumin metalmind,\nreducing other people’s awareness and friendship with them during\nactive storage, and can tap it at a later time in order to speedily form\ntrust relationships with others.\nOracle Mistings burn electrum to see a vision of possible paths\nELECTRUM:\ntheir future could take. This is usually limited to a few seconds.

Soulbearer Ferrings can\nstore Investiture in a nicrosil metalmind. This is a power that very few\nknow anything about; indeed, I’m certain the people of Terris don’t truly\nknow what they are doing when they use these powers.\nPewterarm Mistings (a.k.a.

Locally\nthese are spoken of as the “Metallic Arts,” though there are other names for\nthem.\nAllomancy is the most common of the three. It is end-positive, according\nto my terminology—meaning that the practitioner draws in power from an\nexternal source. The body then filters it into various forms. (The actual\noutlet of the power is not chosen by the practitioner, but instead is\nhardwritten into their Spiritweb.) The key to drawing this power comes in\nthe form of various types of metals, with specific compositions being\nrequired. Though the metal is consumed in the process, the power itself\ndoesn’t actually come from the metal. The metal is a catalyst, you might\nsay, that begins an Investiture and keeps it running.\nIn truth, this isn’t much different from the form-based Investitures one\nfinds on Sel, where specific shape is the key—here, however, the\ninteractions are more limited. Still, one cannot deny the raw power of\nAllomancy. It is instinctive and intuitive for the practitioner, as opposed to\nrequiring a great deal of study and exactness, as one finds in the form-based\nInvestitures of Sel.\nAllomancy is brutal, raw, and powerful. There are sixteen base metals\nthat work, though two others—named the “God Metals” locally—can be\nused in alloy to craft an entirely different set of sixteen each. As these God\nMetals are no longer commonly available, however, the other metals are not\nin wide use.\nFeruchemy is still widely known and used at this point on Scadrial.\nIndeed, you might say that it is more present today than it has been in many\neras past, when it was confined to distant Terris or hidden from sight by the\nKeepers.\nFeruchemy is an end-neutral art, meaning that power is neither gained\nnor lost. The art also requires metal as a focus, but instead of being\nconsumed, the metal acts as a medium by which abilities within the\npractitioner are shuttled through time. Invest that metal on one day,\nwithdraw the power on another day. It is a well-rounded art, with some\nfeelers in the Physical, some in the Cognitive, and even some in the\nSpiritual. The last powers are under heavy experimentation by the Terris\ncommunity, and aren’t spoken of to outsiders.\nIt should be noted that the interbreeding of the Feruchemists with the\ngeneral population has diluted the power in some ways. It is now common"

        "text": "community, and aren’t spoken of to outsiders.\nIt should be noted that the interbreeding of the Feruchemists with the\ngeneral population has diluted the power in some ways. It is now common\nfor people to be born with access to only one of the sixteen Feruchemical\nabilities. It is hypothesized that if one could make metalminds out of alloys\nwith the God Metals, other abilities could be discovered.\nHemalurgy is widely unknown in the modern world of Scadrial. Its\nsecrets were kept close by those who survived their world’s rebirth, and the\nonly known practitioners of it now are the kandra, who (for the most part)\nserve Harmony.\nHemalurgy is an end-negative art. Some power is lost in the practice of it.\nThough many throughout history have maligned it as an “evil” art, none of\nthe Investitures are actually evil. At its core, Hemalurgy deals with\nremoving abilities—or attributes—from one person and bestowing them on\nanother. It is primarily concerned with things of the Spiritual Realm, and is\nof the greatest interest to me. If one of these three arts is of great import to\nthe cosmere, it is this one. I think there are many possibilities for its use.\nCOMBINATIONS\nIt is possible on Scadrial to be born with ability to access both Allomancy\nand Feruchemy. This has been of specific interest to me lately, as the mixing\nof different types of Investiture has curious effects. One needs look only at\nwhat has happened on Roshar to find this manifested—two powers,\ncombined, often have an almost chemical reaction. Instead of getting out\nexactly what you put in, you get something new.\nOn Scadrial, someone with one Allomantic power and one Feruchemical\npower is called “Twinborn.” The effects here are more subtle than they are\nwhen mixing Surges on Roshar, but I am convinced that each unique\ncombination also creates something distinctive. Not just two powers, you\ncould say, but two powers … and an effect. This demands further study.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nBrandon Sanderson grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska.
