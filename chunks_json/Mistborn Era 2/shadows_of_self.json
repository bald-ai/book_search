(I was waiting for editorial notes to come\nback; I believe it was the final Wheel of Time book.) I had to drop work on\nthis and dive into the other book.\nBy the time I came back, my vision for a new trilogy about Wax,\nWayne, and Marasi had transformed—so the first third took some serious\nwork to whip into shape and make match the last two thirds, as I wrote\nthem. I relied a lot on the excellent editorial vision of my editor, Moshe\nFeder, my agent, Joshua Bilmes, and my editorial assistant, the Instant Peter\nAhlstrom. Special thanks as well to my editor in the UK, Simon Spanton.\nIn addition, my writing group was—as always—invaluable. They\ninclude Emily Sanderson, Karen and Peter Ahlstrom, Darci and Eric James\nStone, Alan Layton, Ben “please get my name right this time” Olsen,\nDanielle Olsen, Kathleen Dorsey Sanderson, Kaylynn ZoBell, Ethan and\nIsaac Skarstedt, and Kara and Īsaac Stewart.\nWe did a blitz of a beta read, and some vigilant people jumped in with\nexcellent commentary. They were: Jory Phillips, Joel Phillips, Bob Kluttz,\nAlice Arneson, Trae Cooper, Gary Singer, Lyndsey Luther, Brian T. Hill,\nJakob Remick, Eric James Stone, Bao Pham, Aubree Pham, Steve Godecke,\nKristina Kugler, Ben Olsen, Samuel Lund, Megan Kanne, Nate Hatfield,\nLayne Garrett, Kim Garrett, Eric Lake, Karen Ahlstrom, Isaac Skarstedt,\nDarci Stone, Īsaac Stewart, Kalyani Poluri, Josh Walker, Donald Mustard\nIII, Cory Aitchison, and Christi Jacobsen.\nOver the years, it’s been incredibly satisfying to see the artwork for my\nnovels develop. I’ve always had this wild vision for including way more art\nthan usual—basically all I can get away with. Three wonderful artists made\nthis possible on this volume. Chris McGrath did the cover, and I love his\ndepictions of the characters. My good friend and now full-time art director"

I might need her.”\n“Sure.”\n“And don’t steal anything.”\nThe kid—round-faced and seventeen, with barely a hint of stubble on\nhis face despite weeks of trying—nodded with a solemn expression. “I\npromise I won’t swipe nothin’ of yours, Wax.”\nWaxillium sighed. “That’s not what I said.”\n“But…”\n“Just stay with the horses. And try not to talk to anyone.” Waxillium\nshook his head, pushing into the saloon, feeling a spring in his step. He was\nfilling his metalmind a smidge, decreasing his weight by about ten percent.\nCommon practice for him these days, ever since he’d run out of stored\nweight during one of his first bounty hunts a few months back.\nThe saloon, of course, was dirty. Practically everything out here in the\nRoughs was dusty, worn, or broken. Five years out here, and he still wasn’t\nused to that. True, he’d spent most of those five years trying to make a\nliving as a clerk, moving farther and farther from population centers in an\neffort to avoid getting recognized. But in the Roughs, even the larger\npopulation centers were dirtier than those back in Elendel.\nAnd here, on the fringes of populated lands, dirty didn’t even begin to\ndescribe life. The men he passed in the saloon sat slumped low to their\ntables, hardly looking up. That was another thing about the Roughs. Both"

Both\nplants and people were more prickly, and they grew lower to the ground.\nEven the fanlike acacias, which did stretch high at times, had this fortified,\nhardy sense about them.\nHe scanned the room, hands on hips, hoping he’d draw attention. He\ndidn’t, which nagged at him. Why wear a fine city suit, with a lavender\ncravat, if nobody was going to notice? At least they weren’t snickering, like\nthose in the last saloon.\nHand on his gun, Waxillium sauntered up to the bar. The barkeep was a\ntall man who looked to have some Terris blood in him, from that willowy\nbuild, though his refined cousins in the Basin would be horrified to see him\nchewing on a greasy chicken leg with one hand while serving a mug with\nthe other. Waxillium tried not to be nauseated; the local notion of hygiene\nwas another thing he wasn’t yet accustomed to. Out here, the fastidious\nones were those who remembered to wipe their hands on their trousers\nbetween picking their nose and shaking your hand.\nWaxillium waited. Then waited some more. Then cleared his throat.\nFinally, the barkeep lumbered over to him.\n“Yeah?”\n“I’m looking for a man,” Waxillium said under his breath. “Goes by the\nname of Granite Joe.”\n“Don’t know him,” the barkeep said.\n“Don’t— He’s only the single most notorious outlaw in these parts.”\n“Don’t know him.”\n“But—”\n“It’s safer to not know men like Joe,” the barkeep said, then took a bite\nof his chicken leg. “But I have a friend.”\n“That’s surprising.”\nThe barkeep glared at him.\n“Ahem,” Waxillium said. “Sorry. Continue.”\n“My friend might be willing to know people that others won’t. It will\ntake a little time to get him. You’ll pay?”\n“I’m a lawman,” Waxillium said. “I do what I do in the name of\njustice.”\nThe barkeep blinked. Slowly, deliberately, as if it required conscious\neffort. “So … you’ll pay?”\n“Yes, I’ll pay,” Waxillium said with a sigh, mentally counting what he’d\nalready spent hunting Granite Joe. He couldn’t afford to go in the hole\nagain. Destroyer needed a new saddle, and Waxillium went through suits\nfrightfully quick out here.\n“Good,” the barkeep said, gesturing for Waxillium to follow. They wove\nthrough the room, around tables and past the pianoforte, which sat beside\none of the pillars, between two tables. It didn’t look like it had been played\nin ages, and someone had set a row of dirty mugs on it. Next to the stairs,\nthey entered a small room. It smelled dusty.\n“Wait,” the barkeep said, then shut the door and left.\nWaxillium folded his arms, eyeing the room’s lone chair. The white\npaint was flaking and peeling; he didn’t doubt that if he sat down, he’d end\nup with half of it stuck to his trousers."

These few months chasing bounties had shown him\nthat there were good men and women out here, mixed among the rest. Yet\nthey all had this stubborn fatalism about them. They didn’t trust authority,\nand often shunned lawmen, even if it meant letting a man like Granite Joe\ncontinue to ravage and plunder. Without the bounties set by the railroad and\nmining companies, nothing would ever—\nThe window shook. Waxillium stopped, then grabbed the gun at his side\nand burned steel. The metal created a sharp warmth within him, like the\nfeeling after drinking something too hot. Blue lines sprang up pointing from\nhis chest toward nearby sources of metal, several of which were just outside\nthe shuttered window. Others pointed downward. This saloon had a\nbasement, which was unusual out in the Roughs.\nHe could Push on those lines if he needed to, shoving on the metal they\nconnected to. For now, he just watched as a small rod slipped between the\nwindow casements, then lifted, raising the latch that held them closed. The\nwindow rattled, then swung open.\nA young woman in dark trousers hopped in, rifle in one hand. Lean,\nwith a squarish face, she carried an unlit cigar in her teeth and looked\nvaguely familiar to Waxillium. She stood up, apparently satisfied, then\nturned to close the window. As she did, she saw him for the first time.\n“Hell!” she said, scrambling backward, dropping her cigar, raising her\nrifle.\nWaxillium raised his own gun and prepared his Allomancy, wishing\nhe’d found a way to protect himself from bullets. He could Push on metal,\nyes, but he wasn’t fast enough to stop gunfire, unless he Pushed on the gun\nbefore the trigger was pulled.\n“Hey,” the woman said, looking through the rifle sights. “Aren’t you\nthat guy? The one who killed Peret the Black?”\n“Waxillium Ladrian,” he said. “Lawman for hire.”\n“You’re kidding. That’s how you introduce yourself?”\n“Sure. Why not?”\nShe didn’t answer, instead looking away from her rifle, studying him for\na few moments. Finally she said, “A cravat? Really?”\n“It’s kind of my thing,” Waxillium said. “The gentleman bounty hunter.”\n“Why would a bounty hunter need a ‘thing’ in the first place?”\n“It’s important to have a reputation,” Waxillium said, raising his chin.\n“The outlaws all have them; people have heard of men like Granite Joe\nfrom one side of the Roughs to the other. Why shouldn’t I do the same?”\n“Because it paints a target on your head.”\n“Worth the danger,” Waxillium said. “But speaking of targets…” He\nwaved his gun, then nodded toward hers.\n“You’re after the bounty on Joe,” she said.\n“Sure am. You too?”\nShe nodded.\n“Split it?” Waxillium said.\nShe sighed, but lowered her rifle. “Fine. The one who shoots him gets a\ndouble portion though.”"

The one who shoots him gets a\ndouble portion though.”\n“I was planning to bring him in alive.…”\n“Good. Gives me a better chance of killing him first.” She grinned at\nhim, slipping over to the door. “The name’s Lessie. Granite is in here\nsomewhere, then? Have you seen him?”\n“No, I haven’t,” Waxillium said, joining her at the door. “I asked the\nbarkeep, and he sent me in here.”\nShe turned on him. “You asked the barkeep.”\n“Sure,” Waxillium said. “I’ve read the stories. Barkeeps know\neverything, and … You’re shaking your head.”\n“Everyone in this saloon belongs to Joe, Mister Cravat,” Lessie said.\n“Hell, half the people in this town belong to him. You asked the barkeep?”\n“I believe we’ve established that.”\n“Rust!” She cracked the door and looked out. “How in Ruin’s name did\nyou take down Peret the Black?”\n“Surely it’s not that bad. Everyone in the bar can’t…”\nHe trailed off as he peeked out the door. The tall barkeep hadn’t run off\nto fetch anyone. No, he was out in the taproom of the saloon, gesturing\ntoward the side room’s door and urging the assembled thugs and miscreants\nto stand up and arm themselves. They looked hesitant, and some were\ngesturing angrily, but more than a few had guns out.\n“Damn,” Lessie whispered.\n“Back out the way you came in?” Waxillium asked.\nHer response was to slip the door closed with the utmost care, then\nshove him aside and scramble toward the window. She grabbed the\nwindowsill to step out, but gunfire cracked nearby and wood chips exploded\noff the sill.\nLessie cursed and dropped to the floor. Waxillium dove down beside\nher.\n“Sharpshooter!” he hissed.\n“Are you always this observant, Mister Cravat?”\n“No, only when I’m being shot at.” He peeked up over the lip of the\nwindowsill, but there were a dozen places nearby where the shooter could\nbe hiding. “This is a problem.”\n“There’s that razor-sharp power of observation again.” Lessie crawled\nacross the floor toward the door.\n“I meant in more ways than one,” Waxillium said, crossing the floor in a\ncrouch. “How did they have time to get a sharpshooter into position? They\nmust have known that I was going to show up today. This whole place could\nbe a trap.”\nLessie cursed softly as he reached the door and cracked it open again.\nThe thugs were arguing quietly and gesturing toward the door.\n“They’re taking me seriously,” Waxillium said. “Ha! The reputation is\nworking. You see that? They’re frightened!”\n“Congratulations,” she said. “Do you think they’ll give me a reward if I\nshoot you?”\n“We need to get upstairs,” Waxillium said, eyeing a stairwell just\noutside their door.\n“What good will that do?”\n“Well, for one thing, all the armed people who want to kill us are down"

        "text": "“We need to get upstairs,” Waxillium said, eyeing a stairwell just\noutside their door.\n“What good will that do?”\n“Well, for one thing, all the armed people who want to kill us are down\nhere. I’d rather be somewhere else, and those stairs will be easier to defend\nthan this room. Besides, we might find a window on the other side of the\nbuilding and escape.”\n“Yeah, if you want to jump two stories.”\nJumping wasn’t a problem for a Coinshot; Waxillium could Push off a\ndropped piece of metal as they fell, slowing himself and landing safely. He\nwas also a Feruchemist, and could use his metalminds to reduce his weight\nfar more than he was doing now, shaving it down until he practically\nfloated.\nHowever, Waxillium’s abilities weren’t widely known, and he wanted to\nkeep it that way. He’d heard the stories of his miraculous survivals, and\nliked the air of mystery around them. There was speculation that he was\nMetalborn, sure, but so long as people didn’t know exactly what he could\ndo, he’d have an edge.\n“Look, I’m going to run for the steps,” he said to the woman. “If you\nwant to stay down here and fight your way out, great. You’ll provide an\nideal distraction for me.”\nShe glanced at him, then grinned. “Fine. We’ll do it your way. But if we\nget shot, you owe me a drink.”\nThere is something familiar about her, Waxillium thought. He nodded,\ncounted softly to three, then burst out of the door and leveled his gun at the\nnearest thug. The man jumped back as Waxillium shot three times—and\nmissed. His bullets hit the pianoforte instead, sounding a discordant note\nwith each impact.\nLessie scrambled out behind him and went for the stairs. The motley\ncollection of thugs leveled weapons with cries of surprise. Waxillium swung\nhis gun back—out of the way of his Allomancy—and shoved lightly on the\nblue lines pointing from him toward the men in the room. They opened fire,\nbut his Push had nudged their guns enough to spoil their aim.\nWaxillium followed Lessie up the steps, fleeing the storm of gunfire.\n“Holy hell,” Lessie said as they reached the first landing. “We’re alive.”\nShe looked back at him, cheeks flushed.\nSomething clicked like a lock in Waxillium’s mind. “I have met you\nbefore,” he said.\n“No you haven’t,” she said, looking away. “Let’s keep—”\n“The Weeping Bull!” Waxillium said. “The dancing girl!”\n“Oh, God Beyond,” she said, leading the way up the stairs. “You\nremember.”\n“I knew you were faking. Even Rusko wouldn’t hire someone that\nuncoordinated, no matter how pretty her legs are.”\n“Can we go jump out a window now, please?” she said, checking the top\nfloor for signs of thugs.\n“Why were you there? Chasing a bounty?”\n“Yeah, kind of.”\n“And you really didn’t know they were going to make you—”\n“This conversation is done.”\nThey stepped out onto the top floor, and Waxillium waited a moment\nuntil a shadow on the wall announced someone following them upstairs.

        "text": "“This conversation is done.”\nThey stepped out onto the top floor, and Waxillium waited a moment\nuntil a shadow on the wall announced someone following them upstairs. He\nfired once at the thug who appeared there, missing again, but driving the\nman back. He heard cursing and arguing below. Granite Joe might own the\nmen in this saloon, but they weren’t overly loyal. The first few up the steps\nwould almost certainly get shot, and none would be eager to take the risk.\nThat would buy Waxillium some time. Lessie pushed into a room,\npassing an empty bed with a pair of boots beside it. She threw open the\nwindow, which was on the opposite side of the building from the\nsharpshooter.\nThe town of Weathering spread before them, a lonely collection of\nshops and homes, hunkered down as if waiting—in vain—for the day when\nthe railroad would stretch its fingers this far. In the middle distance, beyond\nthe humble buildings, a few giraffes browsed lazily, the only sign of animal\nlife in the vast plain.\nThe drop out the window was straight down, no roof to climb onto.\nLessie regarded the ground warily. Waxillium shoved his fingers in his\nmouth and whistled sharply.\nNothing happened.\nHe whistled again.\n“What the hell are you doing?” Lessie demanded.\n“Calling my horse,” Waxillium said, then whistled again. “We can hop\ndown into the saddle and ride away.”\nShe stared at him. “You’re serious.”\n“Sure I am. We’ve been practicing.”\nA lone figure walked out onto the street below, the kid who had been\nfollowing Waxillium. “Uh, Wax?” the kid called up. “Destroyer’s just\nstanding there, drinking.”\n“Hell,” Waxillium said.\nLessie looked at him. “You named your horse—”\n“She’s a little too placid, all right?” Waxillium snapped, climbing up\nonto the windowsill. “I thought the name might inspire her.” He cupped his\nhand, calling to the boy below. “Wayne! Bring her out here. We’re going to\njump!”\n“Like hell we are,” Lessie said. “You think there’s something magical\nabout a saddle that will keep us from breaking the horse’s back when we\ndrop into it?”\nWaxillium hesitated. “Well, I’ve read about people doing this.…”\n“Yeah, I’ve got an idea,” Lessie said. “Next, why don’t you call out\nGranite Joe, and go stand out in the road and have a good old-fashioned\nshowdown at noon.”\n“You think that would work? I—”\n“No, it won’t work,” she snapped. “Nobody does that. It’s stupid. Ruin!\nHow did you kill Peret the Black?”\nThey stared at each other a moment.\n“Well…” Waxillium started.\n“Oh hell. You caught him on the crapper, didn’t you?”\nWaxillium grinned at her. “Yeah.”\n“Did you shoot him in the back too?”\n“As bravely as any man ever shot another in the back.”\n“Huh. There might be hope for you yet.”\nHe nodded toward the window. “Jump?”\n“Sure. Why not break both my legs before getting shot? Might as well"

Might as well\ngo all in, Mister Cravat.”\n“I think we’ll be fine, Miss Pink Garter.”\nShe raised an eyebrow.\n“If you’re going to identify me by my clothing choices,” he said, “then I\nfigure I can do the same.”\n“It shall never be mentioned again,” she said, then took a deep breath.\n“So?”\nHe nodded, flaring his metals, preparing to hold on to her and slow them\nas they fell—just enough to make it seem like they’d miraculously survived\nthe jump. As he did, however, he noticed one of his blue lines moving—a\nfaint but thick one, pointing across the street.\nThe window in the mill. Sunlight glinted off something inside.\nWaxillium immediately grabbed Lessie and pulled her down. A fraction\nof a second later, a bullet streaked over their heads and hit the door on the\nother side of the room.\n“Another sharpshooter,” she hissed.\n“Your power of observation is—”\n“Shut it,” she said. “Now what?”\nWaxillium frowned, considering the question. He glanced at the bullet\nhole, gauging the trajectory. The sharpshooter had aimed too high; even if\nWaxillium hadn’t ducked, he’d likely have been all right.\nWhy aim high? The moving blue line to the gun had indicated the\nsharpshooter running to get into position before shooting. Was it just rushed\ntargeting? Or was there a more sinister reason? To knock me out of the sky?\nWhen I flew out the window?\nHe heard footsteps on the stairs, but saw no blue lines. He cursed,\nscrambling over and peeking out. A group of men were creeping up the\nsteps, and not the normal thugs from below. These men wore tight white\nshirts, had pencil mustaches, and were armed with crossbows. Not a speck\nof metal on them.\nRusts! They knew he was a Coinshot, and Granite Joe had a kill squad\nready for him.\nHe ducked back into the room and grabbed Lessie by the arm. “Your\ninformant said Granite Joe was in this building?”\n“Yeah,” she said. “He most certainly is. He likes to be close when a\ngang is being gathered; he likes to keep an eye on his men.”\n“This building has a basement.”\n“… So?”\n“So hang on.”\nHe grabbed her in both hands and rolled onto the ground, causing her to\nyelp, then curse. Holding her over him, he increased his weight.\nHe had a great deal of it stored in his metalmind by now, after weeks of\nsiphoning it off. Now he drew it all out, magnifying his weight manyfold in\nan instant. The wooden floor cracked, then burst open beneath them.\nWaxillium fell through, his fine clothing getting ripped, and dropped\nthrough the air, towing Lessie after him. Eyes squeezed closed, he Pushed\nthe hundreds of blue lines behind him, those leading to the nails in the floor\nbelow. He blasted them downward to shatter the ground level’s floor and\nopen the way into the basement.\nThey crashed through the ground floor in a shower of dust and splinters."

He blasted them downward to shatter the ground level’s floor and\nopen the way into the basement.\nThey crashed through the ground floor in a shower of dust and splinters.\nWaxillium managed to slow their descent with a Steelpush, but they still\ncame down hard, smashing into a table in a basement chamber.\nWaxillium let out a puffing groan, but forced himself to twist around,\nshaking free of the broken wood. The basement, surprisingly, was paneled\nin fine hardwoods and lit by lamps shaped like curvaceous women. The\ntable they had hit bore a rich white tablecloth, though it was now wadded in\na bunch, the table legs shattered and the table itself at an angle.\nA man sat at the table’s head. Waxillium managed to stand up in the\nwreckage and level a gun at the fellow, who had a blocky face and dark\nblue-grey skin—the mark of a man with koloss heritage. Granite Joe.\nWaxillium appeared to have interrupted his dinner, judging by the napkin\ntucked into his collar and the spilled soup on the broken table in front of\nhim.\nLessie groaned, rolling over and brushing splinters off her clothing. Her\nrifle had apparently been left upstairs. Waxillium held his gun in a firm grip\nas he eyed the two duster-wearing bodyguards behind Granite Joe, a man\nand a woman—siblings, he’d heard, and crack shots. They’d been surprised\nby his fall, obviously, for though they’d rested hands on their weapons, they\nhadn’t drawn.\nWaxillium had the upper hand, with the gun on Joe—but if he did shoot,\nthe siblings would kill him in a heartbeat. Perhaps he hadn’t thought\nthrough this line of attack quite as well as he should have.\nJoe scraped at the remnants of his broken bowl, framed by splatters of\nred soup on the tablecloth. He managed to get some onto his spoon and\nlifted it to his lips. “You,” he said after sipping the soup, “should be dead.”\n“You might want to look at hiring a new group of thugs,” Waxillium\nsaid. “The ones upstairs aren’t worth much.”\n“I wasn’t referring to them,” Joe said. “How long have you been up\nhere, in the Roughs, making trouble? Two years?”\n“One,” Waxillium said. He’d been up here longer, but he had only\nrecently started “making trouble,” as Joe put it.\nGranite Joe clicked his tongue. “You think your type is new up here,\nson? Wide-eyed, with a low-slung gunbelt and bright new spurs? Come to\nreform us of our uncivilized ways. We see dozens like you every year. The\nothers have the decency to either learn to be bribed, or to get dead before\nthey ruin too much. But not you.”\nHe’s stalling, Waxillium thought. Waiting for the men upstairs to run\ndown.\n“Drop your weapons!” Waxillium said, holding his gun on Joe. “Drop\nthem or I shoot!”\nThe two guards didn’t move. No metal lines on the guard on the right,\nWaxillium thought. Or on Joe himself. The one on the left had a handgun,\nperhaps trusting the speed of his draw against a Coinshot. The other two"

The other two\nhad fancy hand-crossbows in their holsters, he bet. Single-shot, made of\nwood and ceramic. Built for killing Coinshots.\nEven with Allomancy, Waxillium would never be able to kill all three of\nthem without getting shot himself. Sweat trickled down his temple. He was\ntempted to just pull his trigger and shoot, but he’d be killed if he did that.\nAnd they knew it. It was a standoff, but they had reinforcements coming.\n“You don’t belong here,” Joe said, leaning forward, elbows on his\nbroken table. “We came here to escape folks like you. Your rules. Your\nassumptions. We don’t want you.”\n“If that were true,” Waxillium said, surprised at how level his voice was,\n“then people wouldn’t come to me crying because you killed their sons. You\nmight not need Elendel’s laws up here, but that doesn’t mean you don’t\nneed any laws at all. And it doesn’t mean men like you should be able to do\nwhatever you want.”\nGranite Joe shook his head, standing up, hand to his holster. “This isn’t\nyour habitat, son. Everyone has a price up here. If they don’t, they don’t fit\nin. You’ll die, slow and painful, just like a lion would die in that city of\nyours.

He twisted his gun and fired.\nJoe got his crossbow out and loosed a bolt, but the shot missed, zipping\nthrough the air where Waxillium had been. Waxillium’s own bullet flew true\nfor once, hitting the female guard, who had pulled out her crossbow. She\ndropped, and as Waxillium crashed into the wall, he Pushed—knocking the\ngun out of the other guard’s hand as the man fired.\nWaxillium’s Push, unfortunately, also flung his own gun out of his hand\n—but sent it spinning toward the second bodyguard. His gun smacked the\nman right in the face, dropping him.\nWaxillium steadied himself, looking across the room at Joe, who\nseemed baffled that both his guards were down. No time to think.\nWaxillium scrambled toward the large, koloss-blooded man. If he could\nreach some metal to use as a weapon, maybe—\nA weapon clicked behind him. Waxillium stopped and looked over his\nshoulder at Lessie, who was pointing a small hand-crossbow right at him.\n“Everyone up here has a price,” Granite Joe said.\nWaxillium stared at the crossbow bolt, tipped with obsidian. Where had\nshe been carrying that? He swallowed slowly.\nShe put herself in danger, scrambling up the stairs with me! he thought.\nHow could she have been …\nBut Joe had known about his Allomancy. So had she. Lessie knew he\ncould spoil the thugs’ aim, when she’d joined him in running up the steps."

        "text": "How could she have been …\nBut Joe had known about his Allomancy. So had she. Lessie knew he\ncould spoil the thugs’ aim, when she’d joined him in running up the steps.\n“Finally,” Joe said, “do you have an explanation of why you didn’t just\nshoot him in the saloon room, where the barkeep put him?”\nShe didn’t respond, instead studying Waxillium. “I did warn you that\neveryone in the saloon was in Joe’s employ,” she noted.\n“I…” Waxillium swallowed. “I still think your legs are pretty.”\nShe met his eyes. Then she sighed, turned the crossbow, and shot\nGranite Joe in the neck.\nWaxillium blinked as the enormous man dropped to the floor, gurgling\nas he bled.\n“That?” Lessie said, glaring at Waxillium. “That’s all you could come\nup with to win me over? ‘You have nice legs’? Seriously? You are so\ndoomed up here, Cravat.”\nWaxillium breathed out in relief. “Oh, Harmony. I thought you were\ngoing to shoot me for sure.”\n“Should have,” she grumbled. “I can’t believe—”\nShe cut off as the stairs clattered, the troop of miscreants from above\nhaving finally gathered the nerve to rush down the stairwell. A good half\ndozen of them burst into the room with weapons drawn.\nLessie dove for the fallen bodyguard’s gun.\nWaxillium thought quickly, then did what came most naturally. He\nstruck a dramatic pose in the rubble, one foot up, Granite Joe dead beside\nhim, both bodyguards felled. Dust from the broken ceiling still sprinkled\ndown, illuminated in sunlight pouring through a window above.\nThe thugs pulled to a stop. They looked down at the fallen corpse of\ntheir boss, then gaped toward Waxillium.\nFinally, looking like children who had been caught in the pantry trying\nto get at the cookies, they lowered their weapons. The ones at the front tried\nto push through the ones at the back to get away, and the whole clamorous\nmess of them swarmed back up the steps, leaving the forlorn barkeep, who\nfled last of all.\nWaxillium turned and offered his hand to Lessie, who let him pull her to\nher feet. She looked after the retreating group of bandits, whose boots\nthumped on wood in their haste to escape. In moments the building was\nsilent.\n“Huh,” she said. “You’re as surprising as a donkey who can dance,\nMister Cravat.”\n“It helps to have a thing,” Waxillium noted.\n“Yeah. You think I should get a thing?”\n“Getting a thing has been one of the most important choices I made in\ncoming up to the Roughs.”\nLessie nodded slowly. “I have no idea what we’re talking about, but it\nsounds kinda dirty.” She glanced past him toward Granite Joe’s corpse,\nwhich stared lifelessly, lying in a pool of his own blood.\n“Thanks,” Waxillium said. “For not murdering me.”\n“Eh. I was gonna kill him eventually anyway and turn him in for the\nbounty.”\n“Yes, well, I doubt you were planning to do it in front of his entire gang,\nwhile trapped in a basement with no escape.”"

Right stupid of me, that was.”\n“So why do it?”\nShe kept looking at the body. “I’ve done plenty of things in Joe’s name I\nwish I hadn’t, but as far as I know, I never shot a man who didn’t deserve it.\nKilling you … well, seems like it would have been killing what you stood\nfor too. Ya know?”\n“I think I can grasp the concept.”\nShe rubbed at a bleeding scratch on her neck, where she’d brushed\nbroken wood during their fall. “Next time, though, I hope it won’t involve\nmaking quite so big a mess. I liked this saloon.”\n“I’ll do my best,” Waxillium said. “I intend to change things out here. If\nnot the whole Roughs, then at least this town.”\n“Well,” Lessie said, walking over to Granite Joe’s corpse, “I’m sure that\nif any evil pianos were thinking of attacking the city, they’ll have second\nthoughts now, considering your prowess with that pistol.”\nWaxillium winced. “You … saw that, did you?”\n“Rarely seen such a feat,” she said, kneeling and going through Joe’s\npockets. “Three shots, three different notes, not a single bandit down. That\ntakes skill. Maybe you should spend a little less time with your thing and\nmore with your gun.”\n“Now that sounded dirty.”\n“Good. I hate being crass by accident.” She came out with Joe’s\npocketbook and smiled, tossing it up and catching it. Above, in the hole\nWaxillium had made, an equine head poked out, followed by a smaller,\nteenage one in an oversized bowler hat. Where had he gotten that?\nDestroyer blustered in greeting.\n“Sure, now you come,” Waxillium said. “Stupid horse.”\n“Actually,” Lessie said, “seems to me like staying away from you\nduring a gunfight makes her a pretty damn smart horse.”\nWaxillium smiled and held out his hand to Lessie. She took it, and he\npulled her close. Then he lifted them out of the wreckage on a line of blue\nlight.\nPART ONE\n1\nSEVENTEEN YEARS LATER\nWinsting smiled to himself as he watched the setting sun. It was an ideal\nevening to auction himself off.\n“We have my saferoom ready?” Winsting asked, lightly gripping the\nbalcony banister. “Just in case?”\n“Yes, my lord.” Flog wore his silly Roughs hat along with a duster,\nthough he’d never been outside of the Elendel Basin. The man was an\nexcellent bodyguard, despite his terrible fashion sense, but Winsting made\ncertain to Pull on the man’s emotions anyway, subtly enhancing Flog’s\nsense of loyalty. One could never be too careful.\n“My lord?” Flog asked, glancing toward the chamber behind them.\n“They’re all here, my lord.

        "text": "“They’re all here, my lord. Are you ready?”\nNot turning away from the setting sun, Winsting raised a finger to hush\nthe bodyguard. The balcony, in the Fourth Octant of Elendel, overlooked\nthe canal and the Hub of the city—so he had a nice view of the Field of\nRebirth. Long shadows stretched from the statues of the Ascendant Warrior\nand the Last Emperor in the green park where, according to fanciful legend,\ntheir corpses had been discovered following the Great Catacendre and the\nFinal Ascension.\nThe air was muggy, slightly tempered by a cool breeze off Hammondar\nBay a couple of miles to the west. Winsting tapped his fingers on the\nbalcony railing, patiently sending out pulses of Allomantic power to shape\nthe emotions of those in the room behind him. Or at least any foolish\nenough not to be wearing their aluminum-lined hats.\nAny moment now …\nInitially appearing as pinprick spots in the air, mist grew before him,\nspreading like frost across a window. Tendrils stretched and spun about one\nanother, becoming streams—then rivers of motion, currents shifting and\nblanketing the city. Engulfing it. Consuming it.\n“A misty night,” Flog said. “That’s bad luck, it is.”\n“Don’t be a fool,” Winsting said, adjusting his cravat.\n“He’s watching us,” Flog said. “The mists are His eyes, my lord. Sure as\nRuin, that is.”\n“Superstitious nonsense.” Winsting turned and strode into the room.\nBehind him, Flog shut the doors before the mists could seep into the party.\nThe two dozen people—along with the inevitable bodyguards—who\nmingled and chatted there were a select group. Not just important, but also\nvery much at odds with one another, despite their deliberate smiles and\nmeaningless small talk. He preferred to have rivals at events like this. Let\nthem all see each other, and let each know the cost of losing the contest for\nhis favor.\nWinsting stepped among them. Unfortunately many did wear hats,\nwhose aluminum linings would protect them from emotional Allomancy—\nthough he had personally assured each attendee that none of the others\nwould have Soothers or Rioters with them. He’d said nothing of his own\nabilities, of course. So far as any of them knew, he wasn’t an Allomancer.\nHe glanced across the room to where Blome tended bar. The man shook\nhis head. Nobody else in the room was burning any metals. Excellent.\nWinsting stepped up to the bar, then turned and raised his hands to draw\neveryone’s attention. The gesture exposed the twinkling diamond cuff links\nhe wore on his stiff white shirt. The settings were wooden, of course.\n“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, “welcome to our little auction. The\nbidding begins now, and it ends when I hear the offer I like most.”\nHe said nothing more; too much talk would kill the drama. Winsting\ntook the drink one of his servers offered and stepped out to mingle, then\nhesitated as he looked over the crowd. “Edwarn Ladrian is not here,” he\nsaid softly. He refused to call the man by his silly moniker, Mister Suit.\n“No,” Flog said.\n“I thought you said everyone had arrived!”"

He shuffled,\nuncomfortable.\nWinsting pursed his lips, but otherwise hid his disappointment. He’d\nbeen certain his offer had intrigued Edwarn. Perhaps the man had bought\nout one of the other crime lords in the room. Something to consider.\nWinsting made his way to the central table, which held the nominal\ncenterpiece of the evening. It was a painting of a reclining woman;\nWinsting had painted it himself, and he was getting better.\nThe painting was worthless, but the men and woman in this room would\nstill offer him huge sums for it.\nThe first one to approach him was Dowser, who ran most of the\nsmuggling operations into the Fifth Octant. The three days of scrub on his\ncheeks was shadowed by a bowler that, conspicuously, he had not left in the\ncloakroom. A pretty woman on his arm and a sharp suit did little to clean up\na man like Dowser. Winsting wrinkled his nose. Most everyone in the room\nwas a despicable piece of trash, but the others had the decency not to look\nlike it.\n“It’s ugly as sin,” Dowser said, looking over the painting. “I can’t\nbelieve this is what you’re having us ‘bid’ on. A little cheeky, isn’t it?”\n“And you’d rather I was completely forthright, Mister Dowser?”\nWinsting said. “You’d have me proclaim it far and wide? ‘Pay me, and in\nexchange you get my vote in the Senate for the next year’?”\nDowser glanced to the sides, as if expecting the constables to burst into\nthe room at any moment.\nWinsting smiled. “You’ll notice the shades of grey on her cheeks. A\nrepresentation of the ashen nature of life in a pre-Catacendric world,\nhmmm? My finest work yet. Do you have an offer? To get the bidding\nstarted?”\nDowser said nothing. He would eventually make a bid. Each person in\nthis room had spent weeks posturing before agreeing to this meeting. Half\nwere crime lords like Dowser. The others were Winsting’s own\ncounterparts, high lords and ladies from prominent noble houses, though no\nless corrupt than the crime lords.\n“Aren’t you frightened, Winsting?” asked the woman on Dowser’s arm.\nWinsting frowned. He didn’t recognize her. Slender, with short golden\nhair and a doe-eyed expression, she was uncommonly tall.\n“Frightened, my dear?” Winsting asked. “Of the people in this room?”\n“No,” she said. “That your brother will find out … what you do.”\n“I assure you,” Winsting said. “Replar knows exactly what I am.”\n“The governor’s own brother,” the woman said. “Asking for bribes.”\n“If that truly surprises you, my dear,” Winsting said, “then you have\nlived too sheltered a life. Far bigger fish than I have been sold on this\nmarket. When the next catch arrives, perhaps you will see.”\nThat comment caught Dowser’s attention. Winsting smiled as he saw"

Winsting smiled as he saw\nthe gears clicking behind Dowser’s eyes. Yes, Winsting thought, I did just\nimply that my brother himself might be open to your bribery. Perhaps that\nwould up the man’s offer.\nWinsting moved over to select some shrimp and quiche from a server’s\ntray. “The woman with Dowser is a spy,” Winsting said softly to Flog, who\nwas always at his elbow. “Perhaps in constabulary employ.”\nFlog started. “My lord! We checked and double-checked each person\nattending.”\n“Well you missed one,” Winsting whispered. “I’d bet my fortune on it.\nFollow her after the meeting. If she splits from Dowser for any reason, see\nthat she meets with an accident.”\n“Yes, my lord.”\n“And Flog,” Winsting said, “do be straightforward about it. I won’t have\nyou trying to find a place where the mists won’t be watching. Understand?”\n“Yes, my lord.”\n“Excellent,” Winsting said, smiling broadly as he strolled over to Lord\nHughes Entrone, cousin and confidant to the head of House Entrone.\nWinsting spent an hour mingling, and slowly the bids started to come in.\nSome of the attendees were reluctant. They would rather have met him one-\non-one, making their covert offers, then slipping back into Elendel’s\nunderbelly. Crime lords and nobles alike, these all preferred to dance\naround a topic, not discuss it openly. But they did bid, and bid well. By the\nend of his first circuit of the room, Winsting had to forcibly contain his\nexcitement. No longer would he have to limit his spending. If his brother\ncould—\nThe gunshot was so unexpected, he at first assumed that one of the\nservers had broken something. But no. That crack was so sharp, so\nearsplitting. He’d never heard a gun fired indoors before; he hadn’t known\njust how stunning it could be.\nHe gaped, the drink tumbling from his fingers as he tried to find the\nsource of the shot. Another followed, then another. It became a storm,\nvarious sides firing at one another in a cacophony of death.\nBefore he could cry for help, Flog had him by the arm, towing him\ntoward the stairs down to the saferoom. One of his other bodyguards\nstumbled against the doorway, looking with wide eyes at the blood on his\nshirt. Winsting stared for too long at the dying man before Flog was able to\ntear him away and shove him into the stairwell.\n“What’s happening?” Winsting finally demanded as a guard slammed\nthe door behind them and locked it. The bodyguards hurried him down the\ndim stairway, which was weakly lit by periodic electric lights. “Who fired?\nWhat happened?”\n“No way of knowing,” Flog said. Gunfire still sounded above.\n“Happened too fast.”\n“Someone just started firing,” another guard said. “Might have been\nDowser.”\n“No, it was Darm,” another said. “I heard the first shot from his group.”"

Winsting saw his fortune dying a bloody\ndeath on the floor above them, and he felt sick as they finally reached the\nbottom of the stairs and a vaultlike door, which Flog pushed him through.\n“I’m going to go back up,” Flog said, “see what I can salvage. Find out\nwho caused this.”\nWinsting nodded and shut the door, locking it from the inside. He settled\ninto a chair to wait, fretting. The small bunker of a room had wine and other\namenities, but he couldn’t be bothered. He wrung his hands. What would\nhis brother say? Rusts! What would the papers say? He’d have to keep this\nquiet somehow.\nEventually a knock came at the door, and Winsting glanced through the\npeephole to see Flog. Behind him, a small force of bodyguards watched the\nstairwell. It seemed the gunfire had stopped, though from down here it had\nsounded only like faint popping.\nWinsting opened the door. “Well?”\n“They’re all dead.”\n“All of them?”\n“Every last one,” Flog said, walking into the room.\nWinsting sat heavily in his chair. “Maybe that’s good,” he said,\nsearching for some glimmer of light in this dark disaster. “Nobody can\nimplicate us. Maybe we can just slip away. Cover our tracks somehow?”\nA daunting task. He owned this building. He’d be connected to these\ndeaths. He’d need an alibi. Hell, he was going to have to go to his brother.\nThis could cost him his seat, even if the general public never discovered\nwhat had happened. He slumped in his chair, frustrated. “Well?” he\ndemanded. “What do you think?”\nIn response, a pair of hands grabbed Winsting by the hair, pulled his\nhead back, and efficiently slit his exposed throat.\n2\nI figure I should write one of these things, the small book read. To tell my\nside. Not the side the historians will tell for me. I doubt they’ll get it right. I\ndon’t know that I’d like them to anyhow.\nWax tapped the book with the end of his pencil, then scribbled down a\nnote to himself on a loose sheet.\n“I’m thinking of inviting the Boris brothers to the wedding,” Steris said\nfrom the couch opposite the one Wax sat upon.\nHe grunted, still reading.\nI know Saze doesn’t approve of what I’ve done, the book continued. But\nwhat did he expect me to do? Knowing what I know …\n“The Boris brothers,” Steris continued. “They’re acquaintances of\nyours, aren’t they?”\n“I shot their father,” Wax said, not looking up. “Twice.”\nI couldn’t let it die, the book read. It’s not right. Hemalurgy is good now,\nI figure. Saze is both sides now, right? Ruin isn’t around anymore.\n“Are they likely to try to kill you?” Steris asked.\n“Boris Junior swore to drink my blood,” Wax said. “Boris the Third—"

Eat my toes? He’s not a clever man.”\nWe can use it. We should. Shouldn’t we?\n“I’ll just put them on the list, then,” Steris said.\nWax sighed, looking up from the book. “You’re going to invite my\nmortal enemies,” he said dryly, “to our wedding.”\n“We have to invite someone,” Steris said. She sat with her blonde hair\nup in a bun, her stacks of papers for the wedding arrangements settled\naround her like subjects at court. Her blue flowered dress was fashionable\nwithout being the least bit daring, and her prim hat clung to her hair so\ntightly it might as well have been nailed in place.\n“I’m certain there are better choices for invitations than people who\nwant me dead,” Wax said. “I hear family members are traditional.”\n“As a point of fact,” Steris said, “I believe your remaining family\nmembers actually do want you dead.”\nShe had him there. “Well, yours don’t. Not that I’ve heard anyway. If\nyou need to fill out the wedding party, invite more of them.”\n“I’ve invited all of my family as would be proper,” Steris said. “And all\nof my acquaintances that merit the regard.” She reached to the side, taking\nout a sheet of paper. “You, however, have given me only two names of\npeople to invite. Wayne and a woman named Ranette—who, you noted,\nprobably wouldn’t try to shoot you at your own wedding.”\n“Very unlikely,” Wax agreed. “She hasn’t tried to kill me in years. Not\nseriously, at least.”\nSteris sighed, setting down the sheet.\n“Steris…” Wax said. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to be flippant. Ranette\nwill be fine. We joke about her, but she’s a good friend. She won’t ruin the\nwedding. I promise.”\n“Then who will?”\n“Excuse me?”\n“I have known you for an entire year now, Lord Waxillium,” Steris said.\n“I can accept you for who you are, but I am under no illusions. Something\nwill happen at our wedding. A villain will burst in, guns firing. Or we’ll\ndiscover explosives in the altar. Or Father Bin will inexplicably turn out to\nbe an old enemy and attempt to murder you instead of performing the\nceremony. It will happen. I’m merely trying to prepare for it.”\n“You’re serious, aren’t you?” Wax asked, smiling. “You’re actually\nthinking of inviting one of my enemies so you can plan for a disruption.”\n“I’ve sorted them by threat level and ease of access,” Steris said,\nshuffling through her papers.\n“Wait,” Wax said, rising and walking over. He leaned down next to her,\nlooking over her shoulder at her papers. Each sheet contained a detailed\nbiography. “Ape Manton … The Dashir boys … Rusts! Rick Stranger. I’d\nforgotten about him. Where did you get these?”\n“Your exploits are a matter of public record,” Steris said. “One that is of\nincreasing interest to society.”"

This sort of thing helps me think. Besides, I\nwanted to know what you had spent your life doing.”\nThat was actually kind of sweet. In a bizarre, Steris sort of way.\n“Invite Douglas Venture,” he said. “He’s kind of a friend, but he can’t\nhold his liquor. You can count on him making a disturbance at the after-\nparty.”\n“Excellent,” Steris said. “And the other thirty-seven seats in your\nsection?”\n“Invite leaders among the seamstresses and forgeworkers of my house,”\nWax said. “And the constables-general of the various octants. It will be a\nnice gesture.”\n“Very well.”\n“If you want me to help more with the wedding planning—”\n“No, the formal request to perform the ceremony that you sent to Father\nBin was the only task required of you by protocol. Otherwise I can handle\nit; this is the perfect sort of thing to occupy me. That said, someday I would\nlike to know what is in that little book you peruse so often.”\n“I—”\nThe front door to the mansion slammed open down below, and booted\nfeet thumped up the steps. A moment later, the door to the study burst open\nand Wayne all but tumbled in. Darriance—the house butler—stood\napologetically just behind him.\nWiry and of medium height, Wayne had a round clean-shaven face and\n—as usual—wore his old Roughs clothing, though Steris had pointedly\nsupplied him with new clothing on at least three occasions.\n“Wayne, you could try the doorbell sometime,” Wax said.\n“Nah, that warns the butler,” Wayne said.\n“Which is kind of the point.”\n“Beady little buggers,” Wayne said, shutting the door on Darriance.\n“Can’t trust them. Look, Wax. We’ve got to go! The Marksman has made\nhis move!”\nFinally! Wax thought. “Let me grab my coat.”\nWayne glanced toward Steris. “’Ello, Crazy,” he said, nodding to her.\n“Hello, Idiot,” she said, nodding back.\nWax buckled on his gunbelt over his fine city suit, with vest and cravat,\nthen threw on his mistcoat duster. “Let’s go,” he said, checking his\nammunition.\nWayne pushed his way out the door and barreled down the stairs. Wax\npaused by Steris’s couch. “I…”\n“A man must have his hobbies,” she said, raising another sheet of paper\nand inspecting it. “I accept yours, Lord Waxillium—but do try to avoid\nbeing shot in the face, as we have wedding portraits to sit for this evening.”\n“I’ll remember that.”\n“Keep an eye on my sister out there,” Steris said.\n“This is a dangerous chase,” Wax said, hastening to the door. “I doubt\nMarasi will be involved.”\n“If you think that, then your professional faculties are suspect.

It’s a\ndangerous chase, so she’ll find a way to be involved.”\nWax hesitated by the door. He glanced back at her, and she looked up,\nmeeting his eyes. It felt as if there should be something more to their\nparting. A send-off of some sort. Fondness.\nSteris seemed to sense it too, but neither said anything.\nWax tipped his head back, taking a shot of whiskey and metal flakes,\nthen charged through the doorway and threw himself over the balcony\nrailing. He slowed himself with a Push on the silver inlays in the marble\nfloor of the entrance hall, hitting with a thump of boots on stone. Darriance\nopened the front door ahead of him as he raced out to join Wayne at the\ncoach, for the ride to …\nHe froze on the steps down to the street. “What the hell is that?”\n“Motorcar!” Wayne said from the back seat of the vehicle.\nWax groaned, hastening down the steps and approaching the machine.\nMarasi sat behind the steering mechanism, wearing a fashionable dress of\nlavender and lace. She looked much younger than her half sister, Steris,\nthough only five years separated them.\nShe was a constable now, technically. An aide to the constable-general\nof this octant. She’d never fully explained to him why she would leave\nbehind her career as a solicitor to join the constables, but at least she’d been\nhired on not as a beat constable, but as an analyst and executive assistant.\nShe shouldn’t be subjected to danger in that role.\nYet here she was. A glint of eagerness shone in her eyes as she turned to\nhim. “Are you going to get in?”\n“What are you doing here?” Wax asked, opening the door with some\nreluctance.\n“Driving. You’d rather Wayne do it?”\n“I’d rather have a coach and a good team of horses.” Wax settled into\none of the seats.\n“Stop being so old-fashioned,” Marasi said, moving her foot and\nmaking the devilish contraption lurch forward. “Marksman robbed the First\nUnion, as you guessed.”\nWax held on tightly. He’d guessed that Marksman would hit the bank\nthree days ago. When it hadn’t happened, he’d thought the man had fled to\nthe Roughs.\n“Captain Reddi thinks that Marksman will run for his hideout in the\nSeventh Octant,” Marasi noted, steering around a horse carriage.\n“Reddi is wrong,” Wax said. “Head for the Breakouts.”\nShe didn’t argue. The motorcar thumped and shook until they hit the\nnew section of paving stones, where the street smoothed out and the vehicle\npicked up speed. This was one of the latest motorcars, the type the\nbroadsheets had been spouting about, with rubber wheels and a gasoline\nengine.\nThe entire city was transforming to accommodate them. A lot of trouble\njust so people can drive these contraptions, Wax thought sourly.

Behind them, Wayne leaned halfway out one\nof the windows, holding his hat to his head and grinning.\n“You trained as an attorney,” Wax said. “You belong in a courtroom, not\nchasing a killer.”\n“I’ve done well caring for myself in the past. You never complained\nthen.”\n“Each time, it felt like an exception. Yet here you are again.”\nMarasi did something with the stick to her right, changing the motor’s\ngears. Wax never had been able to get the hang of that. She darted around\nseveral horses, causing one of the riders to shout after them. The swerving\nmotion pushed Wax against the side of the motorcar, and he grunted.\n“What’s wrong with you lately?” Marasi demanded. “You complain\nabout the motorcar, about me being here, about your tea being too hot in the\nmorning. One would almost think you’d made some horrible life decision\nthat you regret deep down. Wonder what it could be.”\nWax kept his eyes forward. In the mirror, he saw Wayne lean back in\nand raise his eyebrows. “She might have a point, mate.”\n“You’re not helping.”\n“Wasn’t intending to,” Wayne said. “Fortunately, I know which horrible\nlife decision she’s talkin’ about. You really should have bought that hat we\nlooked at last week. It was lucky. I’ve got a fifth sense for these things.”\n“Fifth?” Marasi asked.\n“Yeah, can’t smell worth a heap of beans. I—”\n“There,” Wax said, leaning forward and looking through the\nwindscreen. A figure bounded out of a side street soaring through the air,\nlanded in the street, then launched himself down the thoroughfare ahead of\nthem.\n“You were right,” Marasi said. “How did you know?”\n“Marks likes to be seen,” Wax said, slipping Vindication from her\nholster at his side. “Fancies himself a gentleman rogue. Keep this\ncontraption moving steadily, if you can.”\nMarasi’s reply was cut off as Wax threw open the door and leaped out.\nHe fired down and Pushed on the bullet, launching himself upward. A Push\non a passing carriage sent it rocking and nudged Wax to the side, so that\nwhen he came down, he landed on the wooden roof of Marasi’s motorcar.\nHe grabbed the roof’s front lip in one hand, gun up beside his head,\nwind blowing his mistcoat out behind him. Ahead, Marks bounded down\nthe thoroughfare in a series of Steelpushes. Deep within, Wax felt the\ncomforting burn of his own metal.\nHe propelled himself off the motorcar and out over the roadway. Marks\nalways performed his robberies in daylight, always escaped along the\nbusiest roadways he could find. He liked the notoriety. He probably felt\ninvincible.

        "text": "invincible. Being an Allomancer could do that to a man.\nWax sent himself into a series of leaps over motorcars and carriages,\npassing the tenements on either side. The rushing wind, the height and\nperspective, cleared his mind and calmed his emotions as surely as a\nSoother’s touch. His worries dissolved, and for the moment there was only\nthe chase.\nThe Marksman wore red, an old busker’s mask covering his face—black\nwith white tusks, like a demon of the Deepness from old stories. And he\nwas connected to the Set, according to the appointment book Wax had\nstolen from his uncle. After so many months the usefulness of that book\nwas waning, but there were still a few gems to exploit.\nMarks Pushed toward the industrial district. Wax followed, bounding\nfrom motorcar to motorcar. Amazing how much more secure he felt while\nhurtling through the afternoon air, as opposed to being trapped in one of\nthose horrible motorized boxes.\nMarks spun in midair and released a handful of something. Wax Pushed\nhimself off a lamppost and jerked to the side, then shoved Marks’s coins as\nthey passed, sending them out of the way of a random motorcar below. The\nmotor swerved anyway, running toward the canal, the driver losing control.\nRust and Ruin, Wax thought with annoyance, Pushing himself back\ntoward the motorcar. He tapped his metalmind, increasing his weight\ntwentyfold, and came down on the hood of the motorcar.\nHard.\nThe smash crushed the front of the motorcar into the ground, grinding it\nagainst the stones, slowing and then stopping its momentum before it could\ntopple into the canal. He caught a glimpse of stunned people inside, then\nreleased his metalmind and launched himself in a Push after Marks. He\nalmost lost the man, but fortunately the red clothing was distinctive. Wax\nspotted him as he bounded up off a low building, then Pushed himself high\nalong the side of one of the city’s shorter skyscrapers. Wax followed,\nwatching as the man Pushed himself in through a window on the top floor,\nsome twelve or fourteen stories up.\nWax shot up into the sky, windows passing him in a blur. The city of\nElendel stretched out all around, smoke rising from coal plants, factories,\nand homes in countless spouts. He neared the top floor one window to the\nleft of where Marks had entered, and as he landed lightly on the stonework\nledge, he tossed a coin toward the window Marks had used.\nThe coin bounced against the glass. Gunfire sprayed out of the window.\nAt the same time, Wax increased his weight and smashed through his own\nwindow by leaning against it, entering the building. He skidded on glass,\nraising Vindication toward the plaster wall separating him from Marks.\nTranslucent blue lines spread around him, pointing in a thousand\ndifferent directions, highlighting bits of metal. The nails in a desk behind\nhim, where a frightened man in a suit cowered. The metal wires in the\nwalls, leading to electric lamps. Most importantly, a few lines pointed\nthrough the wall into the next room. These were faint; obstructions\nweakened his Allomantic sense.\nOne of those lines quivered as someone in there turned and raised a gun."

These were faint; obstructions\nweakened his Allomantic sense.\nOne of those lines quivered as someone in there turned and raised a gun.\nWax rolled Vindication’s cylinder and locked it into place.\nHazekiller round.\nHe fired, then Pushed, flaring his metal and drilling that bullet forward\nwith as much force as he could. It tore through the wall as if it were paper.\nThe metal in the next room dropped to the floor. Wax threw himself\nagainst the wall, increasing his weight, cracking the plaster. Another slam\nwith his shoulder smashed through, and he broke into the next room,\nweapon raised, looking for his target.\nHe found only a pool of blood soaking into the carpet and a discarded\nsubmachine gun. This room was some kind of clerk’s office. Several men\nand women pressed against the floor, trembling. One woman raised a finger,\npointing out a door. Wax gave her a nod and crouched against the wall next\nto the doorway, then cautiously glanced out.\nWith a painful grating sound, a filing cabinet slid down the hallway\ntoward him. Wax ducked back out of the way as it passed, then leaped out\nand aimed.\nHis gun immediately lurched backward. Wax grabbed it with both\nhands, holding tight, but a second Push launched his other pistol out of its\nholster. His feet started to skid, his gun hauling him backward, and he\ngrowled, but finally dropped Vindication. She tumbled all the way down the\nhall to fetch up beside the ruins of the filing cabinet, which had crashed into\nthe wall there. He would have to come back for her once this was over.\nMarks stood at the other end of the hallway, lit by soft electric lights. He\nbled from a shoulder wound, his face hidden by the black-and-white mask.\n“There are a thousand criminals in this city far worse than I am,” a\nmuffled voice said from behind the mask, “and yet you hunt me, lawman.\nWhy? I’m a hero of the people.”\n“You stopped being a hero weeks ago,” Wax said, striding forward,\nmistcoat rustling. “When you killed a child.”\n“That wasn’t my fault.”\n“You fired the gun, Marks. You might not have been aiming for the girl,\nbut you fired the gun.”\nThe thief stepped back. The sack slung on his shoulder had been torn,\neither by Wax’s bullet or some shrapnel. It leaked banknotes.\nMarks glared at him through the mask, eyes barely visible in the electric\nlight. Then he dashed to the side, holding his shoulder as he ran into another\nroom. Wax Pushed off the filing cabinet and threw himself in a rush down\nthe hallway. He skidded to a stop before the door Marks had gone in, then\nPushed off the light behind, bending it against the wall and entering the\nroom.\nOpen window. Wax grabbed a handful of pens from a desk before\nthrowing himself out the window, a dozen stories up. Banknotes fluttered in\nthe air, trailing behind Marks as he plummeted. Wax increased his weight,\ntrying to fall faster, but he had nothing to Push against and the increased\nweight helped only slightly against air resistance. Marks still hit the ground\nbefore him, then Pushed away the coin he’d used to slow himself."

Marks still hit the ground\nbefore him, then Pushed away the coin he’d used to slow himself.\nA pair of dropped pens—with metal nibs—Pushed ahead of himself into\nthe ground was enough, barely, to slow Wax.\nMarks leaped away, bounding out over some streetlamps. He bore no\nmetal on his body that Wax could spot, but he moved a lot more slowly than\nhe had earlier, and he trailed blood.\nWax followed him. Marks would be making for the Breakouts, a slum\nwhere the people still covered for him. They didn’t care that his robberies\nhad turned violent; they celebrated that he stole from those who deserved it.\nCan’t let him reach that safety, Wax thought, Pushing himself up over a\nlamppost, then shoving on it behind him to gain speed. He closed on his\nprey, who checked on Wax with a frantic glance over his shoulder. Wax\nraised one of the pens, gauging how risky it would be to try to hit Marks in\nthe leg. He didn’t want a killing blow. This man knew something.\nThe slums were just ahead.\nNext bound, Wax thought, gripping the pen. Bystanders stared up from\nthe sidewalks, watching the Allomantic chase. He couldn’t risk hitting one\nof them. He had to—\nOne of those faces was familiar.\nWax lost control of his Push. Stunned by what he’d seen, he barely kept\nhimself from breaking bones as he hit the street, rolling across cobbles. He\ncame to a rest, mistcoat tassels twisted around his body.\nHe drew himself up on hands and knees.\nNo. Impossible. NO.\nHe scrambled across the street, ignoring a stomping black destrier and\nits cursing rider. That face. That face.\nThe last time he had seen that face, he had shot it in the forehead.\nBloody Tan.\nThe man who had killed Lessie.\n“A man was here!” Wax shouted, shoving through the crowd. “Long-\nfingered, thinning hair. A face almost like a bare skull. Did you see him?\nDid anyone see him?”\nPeople stared at him as if he were daft. Perhaps he was. Wax raised his\nhand to the side of his head.\n“Lord Waxillium?”\nHe spun. Marasi had stopped her motorcar nearby, and both she and\nWayne were climbing out. Had she actually been able to tail him during his\nchase? No … no, he’d told her where he thought Marks would go.\n“Wax, mate?” Wayne asked. “You all right? What did he do, knock you\nfrom the air?”\n“Something like that,” Wax mumbled, glancing about one last time.\nRusts, he thought. The stress is digging into my mind.\n“So he got away,” Marasi said, folding her arms, looking displeased.\n“Not yet he didn’t,” Wax said. “He’s bleeding and dropping money.\nHe’ll leave a trail. Come on.”\n3\n“I need you to stay behind as we go into those slums,” Wayne said,\ndetermined to impress solemnity into his voice. “It’s not that I don’t want"

Come on.”\n3\n“I need you to stay behind as we go into those slums,” Wayne said,\ndetermined to impress solemnity into his voice. “It’s not that I don’t want\nyour help. I do. It’s just going to be too dangerous for you. You need to stay\nwhere I know you’re safe. No arguments. I’m sorry.”\n“Wayne,” Wax said, walking past. “Stop talking to your hat and get over\nhere.”\nWayne sighed, patting his hat and then forcing himself to put it down\nand leave it in the motorcar. Wax was a right good fellow, but there were a\nlot of things he didn’t understand. Women for one. Hats for another.\nWayne jogged over to where Wax and Marasi peered into the Breakouts.\nIt seemed a different world in there. The sky inside was strung with\nclotheslines, derelict bits of clothing dangling like hanged men. Wind blew\nout of the place, happy to escape, carrying with it uncertain scents. Food\nhalf cooked. Bodies half washed. Streets half cleaned.\nThe tall, compact tenements cast deep shadows even in the afternoon.\nAs if this were the place dusk came for a drink and a chat before sauntering\nout for its evening duty.\n“The Lord Mistborn didn’t want there to be slums in the city, you\nknow,” Marasi said as the three of them entered. “He tried hard to prevent\nthem from growing up. Built nice buildings for the poor, tried to make them\nlast…”\nWax nodded, absently moving a coin across his knuckles as he walked.\nHe seemed to have lost his guns somewhere. Had he bummed some coins\noff Marasi? It never was fair. When Wayne borrowed coins off folks, he got\nyelled at. He did forget to ask sometimes, but he always offered a good\ntrade.\nAs they penetrated deeper into the Breakouts, Wayne lagged behind the\nother two. Need a good hat … he thought. The hat was important.\nSo he listened for some coughing.\nAh …\nHe found the chap nestled up beside a doorway, a ratty blanket draped\nover his knees. You could always find his type in a slum. Old, clinging to\nlife like a man on a ledge, his lungs half full with various unsavory fluids.\nThe old man hacked into a glove-wrapped hand as Wayne settled down on\nthe steps beside him.\n“What, now,” the man said. “Who are you?”\n“What, now,” Wayne repeated. “Who are you?”\n“I’m nobody,” the man said, then spat to the side. “Dirty outer. I ain’t\ndone nothing.”\n“I’m nobody,” Wayne repeated, taking his flask from the pocket of his\nduster. “Dirty outer. I ain’t done nothing.”\nGood accent, that was. Real mumbly, a classic vintage, wrapped in a\nblanket of history. Closing his eyes and listening, Wayne thought he could\nimagine what people sounded like years ago. He held out the flask of\nwhiskey.\n“You trying to poison me?” the man asked. He clipped off words, left\nout half the sounds.\n“You trying to poison me?” Wayne repeated, working his jaw as if his\nmouth were full of bits of rock he kept trying to chew. Some northern fields"

        "text": "out half the sounds.\n“You trying to poison me?” Wayne repeated, working his jaw as if his\nmouth were full of bits of rock he kept trying to chew. Some northern fields\nmix in this one, for sure. He opened his eyes and tipped the whiskey at the\nman, who smelled it, then took a sip. Then a swig. Then a gulp.\n“So,” the man asked, “you an idiot? I’ve a son that’s an idiot. The real\nkind, that was born that way. Well, you seem all right anyway.”\n“Well, you seem all right anyway,” Wayne said, standing up. He reached\nover to take the man’s old cotton cap off his head, then gestured toward the\nwhiskey flask.\n“In trade?” the man asked. “Boy, you are an idiot.”\nWayne pulled on the cap. “Could you say another word that starts with\n‘h’ for me?”\n“Huh?”\n“Rusting wonderful,” Wayne said. He hopped back down the steps onto\nthe street and ditched his duster in a cranny—and along with it his dueling\ncanes, unfortunately. He kept his wooden knucklebones though.\nThe clothing underneath his duster was Roughs stock, not so different\nfrom what they wore in these slums. Buttoned shirt, trousers, suspenders.\nHe rolled up the sleeves as he walked. The clothing was worn, patched in a\nfew places. He wouldn’t trade it for the world. Took years to get clothing\nthat looked right. Used, lived-in.\nBe slow to trust a man with clothing that was too new. You didn’t get to\nwear new, clean clothing by doing honest work.\nWax and Marasi had paused up ahead, speaking to some old women\nwith scarves on their heads and bundles in their arms. Wayne could almost\nhear what they were saying.\nWe don’t know nothing.\nHe came running past here mere moments ago, Wax would say. Surely\nyou—\nWe don’t know nothing. We didn’t see nothing.\nWayne wandered over to where a group of men sat under a dirty cloth\nawning while eating bruised fruit. “Who’re those outers?” Wayne asked as\nhe sat down, using the accent he’d just picked up from the old man.\nThey didn’t even question him. A slum like this had a lot of people—too\nmany to know everyone—but you could easily tell if someone belonged or\nnot. And Wayne belonged.\n“Conners for sure,” one of the men said. He had a head like an\noverturned bowl, hairless and too flat.\n“They want someone,” another man said. Rust and Ruin, the chap’s face\nwas so pointy, you could have used it to plow a field. “Conners only come\nhere if they want to arrest someone. They’ve never cared about us, and\nnever will.”\n“If they did care,” bowl-head said, “they’d do something about all those\nfactories and power plants, dumping ash on us. We ain’t supposed to live in\nash anymore. Harmony said it, he did.”\nWayne nodded. Good point, that. These building walls, they were ashen.\nDid people care about that, on the outside? No. Not as long as they didn’t\nhave to live in here. He didn’t miss the glares Wax and Marasi drew,\npointed at them by people who passed behind, or who pulled windows"

He didn’t miss the glares Wax and Marasi drew,\npointed at them by people who passed behind, or who pulled windows\nclosed up above.\nThis is worse, Wayne thought. Worse than normal. He’d have to talk to\nWax about it. But for now there was a job to do. “They are looking for\nsomething.”\n“Stay out of it,” bowl-head said.\nWayne grunted. “Maybe there’s money in it.”\n“You’d turn in one of our own?” bowl-head said with a scowl. “I\nrecognize you. Edip’s son, aren’t you?”\nWayne glanced away, noncommittal.\n“You listen here, son,” bowl-head said, wagging his finger. “Don’t trust\na conner, and don’t be a rat.”\n“I ain’t a rat,” Wayne said, testily. He wasn’t. But sometimes, a man just\nneeded cash. “They’re after Marks. I overheard them. There’s a thousand\nnotes on his head, there is.”\n“He grew up here,” plow-face said. “He’s one of us.”\n“He killed that girl,” Wayne said.\n“That’s a lie,” bowl-head said. “Don’t you go talking to conners, son. I\nmean it.”\n“Fine, fine,” Wayne said, moving to rise. “I’ll just go—”\n“You’ll sit back down,” bowl-head said. “Or I’ll rap you something\ngood on your head, I will.”\nWayne sighed, sitting back down. “You olders always talk about us, and\ndon’t know how it is these days. Working in one of the factories.”\n“We know more than you think,” bowl-head said, handing Wayne a\nbruised apple. “Eat this, stay out of trouble, and don’t go where I can’t see\nyou.”\nWayne grumbled, but sat back and bit into the apple. It didn’t taste half\nbad. He ate the whole thing, then helped himself to a couple more.\nIt happened soon enough. The men of the fruit-eating group broke apart,\nleaving Wayne with a basket full of cores. They split with a few amicable\ngibes at one another, each of the four men claiming he had some important\ntask to be about.\nWayne stuffed another apple in each pocket, then stood up and\nsauntered off after bowl-head. He tailed the fellow fairly easily, nodding\noccasionally at people, who nodded back as if they knew him. It was the\nhat. Put on a man’s hat, surround your mind with his way of thinking, and it\nchanged you. A man in dockworker’s clothing passed by, shoulders\nslumped, whistling a sad tune. Wayne picked up the melody. Rough life that\nwas, working the docks. You had to commute each day on the canal boats—\neither that or find a bed out near the waterfront of the bay, where you were\nabout as likely to get stabbed as have breakfast.\nHe’d lived that life as a youth. Had the scars to prove it, he did.

Well, every rusting street in here felt\nlike an alley. Bowl-head entered an alley’s alley. Wayne stepped up to the\nside of the tiny roadway, then burned bendalloy. Allomancy was a useful\ntrick, that it was. Burning the metal set up a nice little bubble of sped-up\ntime around him. He strolled around the corner, staying inside the bubble—\nit didn’t move when he did, but he could move within it.\nYup. There he was, bowl-head himself, crouching beside a rubbish pile,\nwaiting to see if anyone followed him. Wayne had almost made the bubble\ntoo big and caught the man in it.\nSloppy, sloppy, Wayne thought. A mistake like that on the docks could\ncost a man his life. He fished a ratty blanket out of the part of the rubbish\npile that was inside his bubble, then wandered back around the corner and\ndropped the bubble.\nInside the speed bubble, he’d have been moving so quickly bowl-head\nwouldn’t have seen more than a blur—if that. He wouldn’t think anything\nof it, Wayne was certain. If he were wrong, he’d eat his hat. Well, one of\nWax’s hats at least.\nWayne found a set of steps and settled down. He pulled his cap down\nhalf over his eyes, sidled up to the wall in a comfortable position, and\nspread the blanket around himself. Just another homeless drunk.\nBowl-head was a careful one. He waited inside the alley a whole five\nminutes before creeping out, looking back and forth, then hastening to a\nbuilding across the street. He knocked, whispered something, and was let\nin.\nWayne yawned, stretched, and tossed aside the blanket. He crossed the\nstreet to the building that bowl-head had entered, then started checking the\nshuttered windows. The ancient shutters were so old, a good sneeze might\nhave knocked them off. He had to be careful to avoid getting splinters in his\ncheeks as he listened at each window in turn.\nThe men of the slums had an odd sense of morality to them. They\nwouldn’t turn in one of their own to the constables. Not even for a reward.\nBut then again, a chap needed to eat. Wouldn’t a man like Marks want to\nhear just how loyal his friends were?\n“… was a pair of conners for sure,” Wayne heard at a window. “A\nthousand notes is a lot, Marks. A whole lot. Now, I’m not saying you can’t\ntrust the lads; there’s not a bad alloy in the bunch. I can say that a little\nencouragement will help them feel better about their loyalty.”\nRatting out a friend: completely off-limits.\nExtorting a friend: well, that was just good business sense.\nAnd if Marks didn’t act grateful, then maybe he hadn’t been a friend\nafter all. Wayne grinned, slipping his sets of wooden knucklebones over his\nfingers. He stepped back, then charged the building.\nHe hit the shutters with one shoulder, crashing through, then tossed up a\nspeed bubble the moment he hit the floor. He rolled and came up on his feet"

He rolled and came up on his feet\nin front of Marks—who was inside the speed bubble. The man still wore his\nred trousers, though he’d removed his mask, and was bandaging his\nshoulder. He snapped his head up, displaying a surprised face with bushy\neyebrows and large lips.\nRusts. No wonder the fellow normally wore a mask.\nWayne swung at his chin, laying him out with one punch. Then he spun,\nfists up, but the other half-dozen occupants of the room, including bowl-\nhead, stood frozen just outside the edge of his speed bubble. Now that was\nright lucky.\nWayne grinned, heaving Marks up onto his shoulder. He took his\nknuckles off, slipping them into his pocket, and got out an apple. He took a\njuicy bite, waved farewell to bowl-head—who looked forward with glassy\neyes, frozen—then tossed Marks out the window and followed after.\nOnce he passed beyond the edge of his speed bubble, it automatically\ncollapsed.\n“What the hell was that!” bowl-head yelled inside.\nWayne heaved the unconscious Marks up onto his shoulder again, then\nwandered back down the road, chewing on his apple.\n* * *\n“Let me talk to the next ones,” Marasi said. “Maybe I can get them to say\nsomething.”\nShe felt Waxillium’s eyes on her. He thought she was trying to prove\nherself to him. Once he’d have been right. Now she was a constable—fully\ncredentialed and in the city’s employ. This was her job. Waxillium didn’t\nagree with her decision, but her actions were not subject to his approval.\nTogether they walked up to a group of young outcasts sitting on the\nsteps of the slums. The three boys watched them with suspicion, their skin\ndirty, their too-big clothing tied at the waists and ankles. That was the style,\napparently, for youths of the streets. They smelled of the incense they’d\nbeen smoking in their pipes.\nMarasi stepped up to them. “We’re looking for a man.”\n“If you need a man,” one of the boys said, looking her up and down,\n“I’m right here.”\n“Oh please,” Marasi said. “You’re … what, nine?”\n“Hey, she knows how long it is!” the boy said, laughing and grabbing\nhis crotch. “Have you been peeking at me, lady?”\nWell, that’s a blush, Marasi thought. Not terribly professional.\nFortunately, she’d spent time around Wayne and his occasional colorful\nmetaphors. Blushes would happen. She pressed onward. “He came shooting\nthrough here less than an hour ago. Wounded, trailing blood, wearing red.\nI’m sure you know who I’m speaking of.”\n“Yeah, the man of hours!” one of the boys said, laughing and\nreferencing a figure from old nursemaid tales. “I know him!”\nTreat them like a belligerent witness, she thought.

The location of dusk, if you will. Here in these\ntenements.”\n“We might know that,” one of the boys said. “Though, you know, stories\ncost a lot. More than that.”\nBehind her, something clinked. Waxillium had gotten out a few coins\ntoo. The boys glanced at those, eager, until Waxillium flipped one up into\nthe air and Pushed until it was lost.\nThe boys grew quiet immediately.\n“Talk to the lady,” Waxillium said softly, with an edge to his voice.\n“Stop wasting our time.”\nMarasi turned to him, and behind her the boys made their decision.\nThey scattered, obviously not wanting to deal with an Allomancer.\n“That was very helpful,” Marasi said, folding her arms. “Thank you so\nmuch.”\n“They were going to lie to you,” Waxillium said, glancing over his\nshoulder. “And we were drawing the wrong kind of attention.”\n“I realize they were going to lie,” Marasi said. “I was going to catch\nthem in it. Attacking someone’s false story is often one of the best methods\nof interrogation.”\n“Actually,” Waxillium said, “the best method of interrogation involves a\ndrawer and someone’s fingers.”\n“Actually,” Marasi said, “it does not. Studies show that forced\ninterrogation results in bad information almost all the time. Anyway, what is\nwrong with you today, Waxillium? I realize you’ve been flaunting your\n‘tough Roughs lawman’ persona lately—”\n“I have not.”\n“You have,” she said. “And I can see why. Out in the Roughs, you acted\nthe gentleman lawman. You yourself told me you clung to civilization, to\nbring it with you. Well, here you’re around lords all the time. You’re\npractically drowning in civilization. So instead, you lean on being the\nRoughs lawman—to bring a little old-fashioned justice to the city.”\n“You’ve thought about this a lot,” he said, turned away from her,\nscanning the street.\nRust and Ruin. He thought she was infatuated with him. Arrogant,\nbrutish … idiot! She puffed out and stalked away.\nShe was not infatuated. He had made it clear there would be nothing\nbetween them, and he was engaged to her sister. That was that. Couldn’t the\ntwo of them have a professional relationship now?"

Couldn’t the\ntwo of them have a professional relationship now?\nWayne lounged on the steps leading up to a nearby building, watching\nthem and sloppily taking bites out of an apple.\n“And where have you been?” Marasi asked, walking up to him.\n“Apple?” Wayne said, handing another one toward her. “’s not too\nbruised.”\n“No thank you. Some of us have been trying to find a killer, not a meal.”\n“Oh, that.” Wayne kicked at something beside him on the ground,\nhidden in the shadow of the steps. “Yeah, took care of that for you.”\n“You took … Wayne, that’s a person at your feet! Rusts! He’s\nbleeding!”\n“Sure is,” Wayne said. “Not my fault at all, that. I did knock ’im upside\nthe head though.”\nMarasi raised a hand to her mouth. It was him. “Wayne, where …\nHow…”\nWaxillium gently pushed her aside; she hadn’t seen him approach. He\nknelt down, checking Marks’s wound. Waxillium then looked up at Wayne\nand nodded, the two sharing an expression they often exchanged. The\nclosest Marasi had been able to figure, it meant something between “Nice\nwork” and “You’re a total git; I wanted to do that.”\n“Let’s get him to the constabulary offices,” Waxillium said, lifting the\nunconscious Marks.\n“Yes, fine,” Marasi said. “But aren’t you going to ask how he did this?\nWhere he’s been?”\n“Wayne has his methods,” Waxillium said. “In a place like this, they’re\nfar better than my own.”\n“You knew,” she said, leveling a finger at Waxillium. “You knew we\nweren’t going to get anywhere asking questions!”\n“I suspected,” Waxillium said. “But Wayne needs space to try his\nmethods—”\n“—onnacount of my being so incredible,” Wayne added.\n“—so I did my best to find Marks on my own—”\n“—onnacount of him being unable to accept that I’m better at this sorta\nthing than he is—”\n“—in case Wayne failed.”\n“Which never happens.” Wayne grinned and took a bite of his apple,\nhopping off his steps to walk beside Waxillium. “Except that one time. And\nthat other one time. But those don’t matter, onnacount of my getting hit to\nthe head enough times that I can’t remember them.”\nMarasi sighed inwardly, falling into step with the two. They had so\nmuch history that they moved in concert subconsciously, like two dancers\nwho had performed together countless times. That made life particularly\ndifficult for the newcomer who tried to perform with them.\n“Well,” Marasi said to Wayne, “you could at least tell me what you did.\nPerhaps I could learn from your methods.”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “Won’t work for you. You’re too pretty. In an\nunpretty sort of way to me, mind you. Let’s not go around that tree again.”\n“Wayne, sometimes you completely baffle me.”\n“Only sometimes?” Waxillium asked."

Let’s not go around that tree again.”\n“Wayne, sometimes you completely baffle me.”\n“Only sometimes?” Waxillium asked.\n“I can’t give her all I got, mate,” Wayne said, thumbs behind his\nsuspenders. “Gotta save some for everyone else. I dole it out with no\nrespect for privilege, class, sex, or mental capacity. I’m a rusting saint, I\nam.”\n“But how,” Marasi said. “How did you find him? Did you make some of\nthese people talk?”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “I made them not talk. They’re better at that. Comes\nfrom practice, I suspect.”\n“You should take lessons,” Waxillium added.\nMarasi sighed as they approached the entrance to the Breakouts. The\nhuman flotsam who earlier had cluttered the stairwells and alleyways in\nhere had melted away, perhaps finding the attention of several lawmen too\ndiscomforting. It—\nWaxillium stiffened. Wayne did as well.\n“What—?” Marasi began, right as Waxillium dropped Marks and\nreached for his mistcoat pocket. Wayne shoved his shoulder into Marasi,\npushing her away as something zipped down out of the air and clacked\nagainst the paving stones where they’d been standing. More projectiles\nfollowed, though she wasn’t really looking. She instead let Wayne tow her\nto relative cover beside a building, then both of them began craning to\nsearch the skyline for the sniper. Waxillium took to the air with a dropped\ncoin, a dark rush of twisting mistcoat tassels. At times like this he looked\nmore primal, like one of the ancient Mistborn from the legends. Not a\ncreature of law, but a sliver of the night itself come to collect its due.\n“Aw, hell,” Wayne said, nodding toward Marks. The body slumped in\nthe middle of the road, and now had a prominent wooden shaft sticking out\nof it.\n“Arrow?” Marasi asked.\n“Crossbow bolt,” Wayne said. “Haven’t seen one of those in years. You\nreally only want them for fighting Allomancers.” He looked up. Above,\nWaxillium gave chase, soaring toward the top of one of the buildings.\n“Stay here,” Wayne said, then dashed off down an alleyway.\n“Wait—” Marasi said, raising a hand.\nBut he was gone.\nThose two, she thought in annoyance. Well, obviously someone didn’t\nwant Marks to be captured and spill what he knew. Perhaps she could learn\nsomething from the crossbow bolt or the corpse itself.\nShe knelt down beside the body, checking first to make certain he was\ndead—hoping perhaps that the crossbow bolt had not finished the job. He\nwas dead, unfortunately. The bolt was firmly lodged in the head. Who knew\nthat a crossbow could penetrate a skull like that? Marasi shook her head,\nreaching into her handbag to get her notepad and do a write-up of the\nposition the body had fallen in.\nYou know, she thought. The assassin is lucky. They were gone so fast,\nthey couldn’t have known that they dealt a killing blow. If I were looking to\nmake sure Marks was finished off, I’d certainly …\nShe heard something click behind her.\n… double back and check."

If I were looking to\nmake sure Marks was finished off, I’d certainly …\nShe heard something click behind her.\n… double back and check.\nMarasi turned slowly to find a ragged-looking man leaving an alleyway,\nholding a crossbow. He inspected her with dark eyes.\nThe next part happened quickly. Before Marasi had time to take a step,\nthe man rushed her. He fired the crossbow over his shoulder—causing a\nWayne-like yelp to come out of the alleyway—then grabbed Marasi by the\nshoulder as she tried to run.\nHe whipped her about, raising something cold to her neck. A glass\ndagger. Waxillium dropped to the ground in front of them, mistcoat\nunfurling around him.\nThe two stared at one another, a coin in Waxillium’s right hand. He\nrubbed it with his thumb.\nRemember your hostage training, woman! Marasi thought. Most men\ntake a hostage out of desperation. Could she use her Allomancy? She could\nslow time around her, speeding it up for everyone outside her speed bubble.\nThe opposite of what Wayne could do.\nBut she hadn’t swallowed any cadmium. Stupid! A mistake the other\ntwo would never make. She needed to stop being embarrassed with her\npowers, weak though they were. She’d used them effectively on more than\none occasion.\nThe man breathed in and out raggedly, his head right next to hers. She\ncould feel the stubble of his chin and cheek against her skin.\nMen who take hostages don’t want to kill, she thought. This isn’t part of\nthe plan. You can talk him down, speak comforting words, seek common\nground and build upon it.\nShe didn’t do any of that. Instead, she whipped her hand out of her\nhandbag, gripping the small, single-shot pistol she kept inside. Before even\nconsidering what she was doing, she pressed the barrel against the man’s\nchin, pulled the trigger …\nAnd blew the bottom of his head up out of the top.\n4\nWax lowered his hand, looking at the new corpse beside Marasi. Her shot\nhad taken off a big chunk of the face. Identifying the man would be near\nimpossible.\nIt would have been anyway. Suit’s minions were notoriously difficult to\ntrace.\nDon’t worry about that right now, he thought, taking out a handkerchief.\nHe walked over and held it up to Marasi, who stood with wide eyes, blood\nand bits of flesh sprayed across her face. She stared straight ahead and did\nnot look down. She’d dropped the pistol.\n“That was…” she said, eyes ahead. “That was…” She took a deep\nbreath. “That was unexpected of me, wasn’t it?”\n“You did well,” Wax said. “People assume a captive to be in their\npower. Often the best way to escape is by fighting back.”\n“What?” Marasi said, finally taking the handkerchief.\n“You discharged a pistol right beside your head,” Wax said. “You are\ngoing to have trouble hearing. Rusts … you’ve probably done some\npermanent damage to your ear. Hopefully it won’t be too bad.”\n“What?”\nWax gestured toward her face, and she looked at the handkerchief, as if"

She blinked, then glanced down. She looked\naway from the corpse immediately and began wiping at her face.\nWayne, grumbling, staggered out of the alleyway, a new hole in his\nclothing at the shoulder and a crossbow bolt in his hand.\n“So much for interrogating him,” Marasi said with a grimace.\n“It’s all right,” Wax said. “Living was more important.”\n“… What?”\nHe smiled at her reassuringly as Wayne waved to some other constables,\nwho had finally arrived on the scene and were making their way into the\nslums.\n“Why does this keep happening to me?” Marasi asked. “Yes, I know I\nwon’t be able to hear your reply. But this is … what, the third time someone\nhas tried to use me as a hostage? Do I exude indefensibility or something?”\nYes, you do, Wax thought, though he didn’t say it. That’s a good thing. It\nmakes them underestimate you. Marasi was a strong person. She thought\nclearly in times of stress; she did what needed to be done, even if it was\nunpleasant. However, she was also very keen on dressing nicely and making\nherself up.\nLessie would have had none of that. The only times Wax had seen her in\na dress were when they’d made the occasional trip to Covingtar to visit the\nPathian gardens there. He smiled, remembering a time she’d actually worn\ntrousers under the dress.\n“Lord Ladrian!” Constable Reddi trotted over, wearing the uniform of a\ncaptain in the constabulary. The lean man had a neatly clipped, drooping\nmustache.\n“Reddi,” Wax said, nodding to him. “Is Aradel here?”\n“The constable-general is engaged in another investigation, my lord,”\nReddi said with a crisp tone. Why did Wax always want to smack this man\nafter talking to him? He was never insulting, always impeccably proper.\nMaybe that was reason enough.\nWax pointed toward the buildings. “Well, if you’d kindly have your men\nsecure the area; we should probably question those nearby and see if, by\nsome miracle, we can discover the identity of the man Lady Colms just\nkilled.”\nReddi saluted, though it wasn’t technically necessary. Wax had a special\ndeputized forbearance in the constabulary, allowing him to do things like …\nwell, jump through the city armed and firing. But he wasn’t in their\ncommand structure.\nThe other constables moved to do as he requested anyway. As he\nglanced at the Marksman, Wax forcibly kept his anger in check. At this rate,\nhe would never track down his uncle Edwarn. Wax had only the slightest\nhint of what the man was trying to accomplish.\nIt can make anyone into an Allomancer, you see.… If we don’t use it,\nsomeone else will.\nWords from the book Ironeyes had given him.\n“Excellent work, my lord,” Reddi said in a calm voice, nodding to the\nfallen Marksman. The clothing was distinctive. “Another miscreant dealt\nwith, and with your customary efficiency.”"

The clothing was distinctive. “Another miscreant dealt\nwith, and with your customary efficiency.”\nWax said nothing. Today’s “excellent work” was just another dead end.\n“Hey, look!” Wayne said nearby. “I think I found one of that fellow’s\nteeth! That’s good luck, ain’t it?”\nMarasi looked woozy, settling down on a nearby set of steps. Wax was\ntempted to go comfort her, but would she interpret it the wrong way? He\ndidn’t want to lead her on.\n“My lord, could we talk?” Reddi said as more constables flooded the\narea. “I mentioned the constable-general and another case. I was actually\nalready on my way to find you when we heard of your chase here.”\nWax turned to him, immediately alert. “What has happened?”\nReddi grimaced, showing uncharacteristic emotion. “It’s bad, my lord,”\nhe said more softly. “Politics is involved.”\nThen Suit might be involved as well. “Tell me more.”\n“It, well, it’s connected to the governor, my lord. His brother, you see,\nwas hosting an auction last night. And, well, you should see for\nyourself.…”\n* * *\nMarasi didn’t miss Waxillium grabbing Wayne by the shoulder and pointing\ntoward a waiting constabulary carriage. He didn’t come for her. How long\nwould it be before that damnable man was willing to accept her as, if not an\nequal, a colleague?\nFrustrated, she made toward the carriage. Unfortunately, she ran into\nCaptain Reddi on the way. He spoke, and she had to strain her ringing ears\n—and guess a little—to figure out what he was saying.\n“Constable Colms. You are out of uniform.”\n“Yes, sir,” she said. “It is my day off, sir.”\n“Yet here you are,” he said, hands clasped behind his back. “How is it\nthat you find your way, consistently, into situations like this, despite\nexplicitly being told that it is not your assignment, as you are not a field\nconstable?”\n“Pure happenstance I’m sure, sir,” Marasi said.\nHe gave her a sneer at that. Funny. He usually saved those for\nWaxillium, when the man wasn’t looking. He said something she couldn’t\nmake out, then nodded toward the motorcar she’d brought—which was\ntechnically constabulary property; she’d been told to become proficient in\ndriving motorcars and report on their effectiveness to the constable-general.\nHe wanted to test them as replacements for horse-drawn carriages.\n“Sir?” she said.\n“You’ve obviously been through a great deal this day, constable,” Reddi\nsaid, more loudly. “Don’t argue with me on this. Head home, clean up, and\nreport for duty tomorrow.”\n“Sir,” Marasi said. “I’d like to brief Captain Aradel on my pursuit of the\nMarksman, and his subsequent demise, before the details become fuzzy. He\nwill be interested, as he’s followed this case personally.”\nShe stared Reddi in the eyes. He outranked her, yes, but he wasn’t her\nboss. Aradel was that to both of them."

Aradel was that to both of them.\n“The constable-general,” Reddi said with some obvious reluctance, “is\naway from the offices at the moment.”\n“Well then, I’ll report to him and let him dismiss me, sir,” Marasi said.\n“If that is his wish.”\nReddi ground his teeth and started to say something, but a call from one\nof the other constables diverted him. He waved toward the motorcar, and\nMarasi took it as dismissal to do as she’d said. So, when the carriage with\nWaxillium pulled away, she followed in the motor.\nBy the time the trip had ended, at a fashionable mansion overlooking the\ncity’s Hub, she had started to recover. She was still feeling shaken, though\nshe hoped she didn’t show it, and she could hear with her left ear, if not on\nthe other side, where she’d fired the gun.\nAs she climbed out of the motorcar, she found herself wiping her cheek\nagain with her handkerchief, though she had long since cleaned off the\nblood. Her dress had been thoroughly ruined. She grabbed her constable’s\ncoat from the back of the motorcar and threw it over the top to hide the\nstains, then rushed over to join Waxillium and the others as they descended\nfrom the carriage.\nOnly one other constabulary carriage, she noted, inspecting the drive.\nWhatever had happened here, Aradel didn’t want to make a big show of it.\nAs Waxillium walked up toward the front, he glanced about and found her,\nthen waved her over to him.\n“Do you know what this might be about?” he asked her quietly as Reddi\nand several other constables conferred near the carriage.\n“No,” Marasi said. “They didn’t brief you?”\nWaxillium shook his head. He glanced down at her bloodied dress,\nwhich peeked out underneath the sturdy brown jacket. He made no\ncomment however, instead striding up the steps, tailed by Wayne.\nTwo constables, a man and a woman, guarded the door into the\nmansion. They saluted as Reddi caught up to Waxillium—pointedly\nignoring Marasi—and led the way in through the doors. “We’ve tried to\nkeep this very tightly controlled,” Reddi said. “But word will get out, with\nLord Winsting involved. Rusts, this is going to be a nightmare.”\n“The governor’s brother?” Marasi asked. “What happened here?”\nReddi pointed up a set of steps. “We should find Constable-General\nAradel in the grand ballroom. I warn you, this is not a sight for delicate\nstomachs.” He glanced at Marasi.\nShe raised an eyebrow. “Not an hour ago, I had a man’s head literally\nexplode all over me, Captain. I believe I will be fine.”\nReddi said nothing further, leading the way up the steps. She noticed\nWayne pocketing a small, decorative cigar box they passed—Citizen\nMagistrates brand—replacing it with a bruised apple. She’d have to see that\nhe swapped the cigar box back at some point.\nThe ballroom upstairs was littered with bodies. Marasi and Waxillium"

        "text": "Magistrates brand—replacing it with a bruised apple. She’d have to see that\nhe swapped the cigar box back at some point.\nThe ballroom upstairs was littered with bodies. Marasi and Waxillium\nstopped in the doorway, looking in at the chaos. The dead men and women\nwore fine clothes, sleek ball gowns or tight black suits. Hats lay tumbled\nfrom heads, the fine tan carpet stained red in wide patches around the fallen.\nIt was as if someone had tossed a basket of eggs into the air and let them\nfall, their insides seeping out all over the floor.\nClaude Aradel, constable-general of the Fourth Octant, picked through\nthe scene. In many ways, he didn’t look like a constable should. His\nrectangular face had a few days’ worth of red stubble on it; he shaved when\nthe mood struck him. His leathery skin, furrowed with wrinkles, attested to\ndays spent in the field, not behind a desk. He was probably pushing sixty at\nthis point, though he wouldn’t divulge his true age, and even the octant\nrecords had a question mark next to his birth date. What was certain was\nthat Aradel didn’t have a drop of noble blood in him.\nHe’d left the constabulary about ten years ago, giving no official reason\nfor his departure. Rumor was he’d hit the silent ceiling on promotions a\nman could get without being noble. A lot could change in ten years though,\nand when Brettin had retired—soon after the execution of Miles\nHundredlives almost a year ago—the hunt for a new constable-general had\nlanded on Aradel. He’d come out of retirement to accept the position.\n“Ladrian,” he said, looking up from a corpse. “Good. You’re here.” He\ncrossed the room and gave a glance to Marasi, who saluted. He didn’t\ndismiss her.\n“Aw,” Wayne said, peeking in, “the fun is already over.”\nWaxillium stepped into the room, taking Aradel’s proffered hand.\n“That’s Chip Erikell, isn’t it?” Waxillium asked, nodding to the nearest\ncorpse. “Thought to run smuggling in the Third Octant?”\n“Yes,” Aradel said.\n“And Isabaline Frellia,” Marasi said. “Rusts! We have a file on her as\ntall as Wayne, but the prosecutors have never been able to charge her.”\n“Seven of these bodies belong to people of equivalent notoriety,” Aradel\nsaid, pointing to several corpses among the fallen. “Most from crime\nsyndicates, though a few were members of noble houses with … dubious\nreputations. The rest were high-ranking representatives from other\nimportant factions. We have near thirty notable stiffs, along with a handful\nof guards each.”\n“That’s half of the city’s criminal elite,” Waxillium said softly,\ncrouching down beside a body. “At least.”\n“All people we’ve never been able to touch,” Aradel said. “Not for lack\nof trying, mind you.”\n“So why is everyone so grim?” Wayne asked. “We should be throwing a\nbloomin’ party, shouldn’t we? Someone went and did our work for us! We\ncan take the month off.”\nMarasi shook her head. “A violent change in power in the underworld"

We\ncan take the month off.”\nMarasi shook her head. “A violent change in power in the underworld\ncan be dangerous, Wayne. This was a hit of huge ambition, someone\neliminating rivals wholesale.”\nAradel glanced at her, then nodded in agreement. She felt a surge of\nsatisfaction. The constable-general was the one who had hired her, picking\nher application out of a dozen others. Every other person in the pile had had\nyears of constable experience. Instead, he’d chosen a recently graduated\nlaw student. He saw something promising in her, obviously, and she\nintended to prove him right.\n“I can’t fathom someone doing this,” Waxillium said. “Toppling so\nmany of the city’s underworld powers at once won’t favor the perpetrators;\nthat’s a myth from penny novels. Murders on this scale will just draw\nattention and unify opposition from every other surviving gang and faction\nas soon as word gets out.”\n“Unless it was done by an outsider,” Marasi said. “An uncertain element\nfrom the start, someone who stands to gain if the entire system crumbles.”\nAradel grunted, and Waxillium nodded in agreement.\n“But how,” Waxillium whispered. “How did someone achieve this?\nSurely their security must have rivaled any in the city.” He began moving\nabout, pacing off distances, looking at certain bodies, then at others,\nwhispering to himself as he periodically knelt down.\n“Reddi said that the governor’s brother was involved, sir?” Marasi\nasked Aradel.\n“Lord Winsting Innate.”\nLord Winsting, head of House Innate. He had a vote in the Elendel\nSenate, a position he gained once his brother was elevated to governor. He\nhad been corrupt. Marasi and the rest of the constables knew it. In\nretrospect, she wasn’t surprised to find him in the middle of something like\nthis. The thing was, Winsting had always seemed a small catch to Marasi.\nThe governor, however … well, perhaps that hidden file on her desk—\nfull of hints, guesses, and clues—would finally be relevant.\n“Winsting,” she asked Aradel. “Is he…?”\n“Dead?” Aradel asked. “Yes, Constable Colms. From the invitations we\nfound, he initiated this meeting, under the guise of an auction. We located\nhis corpse in a saferoom in the basement.”\nThis drew Waxillium’s attention. He stood up, looking directly at them,\nthen muttered something to himself and paced off another body. What was\nhe searching for?\nWayne wandered over to Marasi and Aradel. He took a swig from a\nsilver flask engraved with someone else’s initials. Marasi pointedly did not\nask him which of the dead he’d taken it from. “So,” he said, “our little\nhouse leader was friendly with criminals, was he?”\n“We’ve long suspected he was crooked,” Aradel said. “The people love\nhis family though, and his brother went to great lengths to keep Winsting’s\nprevious lapses out of the limelight.”\n“You’re right, Aradel,” Waxillium said from across the room. “This will\nbe bad.”\n“I dunno,” Wayne said. “Maybe he didn’t know these folks were all"

The fun isn’t over.”\n“Many of these people shot one another,” Waxillium said.\nThey all turned to him. He knelt beside another body, inspecting the\nway it had fallen, then looked up toward some bullet holes in the wall.\nBeing a lawman, particularly out in the Roughs, had required Waxillium\nto teach himself a wide variety of skills. He was part detective, part\nenforcer, part leader, part scientist. Marasi had read a dozen different\nprofiles of him by various scholars, all investigating the mindset of a man\nwho was becoming a living legend.\n“What do you mean, Lord Ladrian?” Aradel asked.\n“The fight here involved multiple parties,” Waxillium said, pointing. “If\nthis was an unexpected hit by someone external—and Lady Colms is right,\nthat would have made the most sense—one would expect the victims to\nhave died from a barrage fired by the enemy who burst in. The corpses\ndon’t tell that story. This was a melee. Chaos. Random people firing one at\nanother. I think it began when someone started shooting from the middle of\nthe group outward.”\n“So it was one of the attendees who began it,” Aradel said.\n“Maybe,” Waxillium said. “One can only tell so much from the fall of\nthe bodies, the sprays of blood. But something is odd here, very odd.…\nWere they all shot?”\n“No, strangely. A few of the attendees were killed by a knife in the\nback.”\n“Have you identified everyone in the room?” Waxillium asked.\n“Most of them,” Aradel said. “We wanted to avoid moving them too\nmuch.”\n“Let me see Lord Winsting,” Waxillium said, standing, his mistcoat\nrustling.\nAradel nodded to a young constable, and she led them out of the\nballroom, through a doorway. Some kind of secret passage? The musty\nstairwell beyond was narrow enough to force them to walk single file, the\nconstable at the front carrying a lamp.\n“Miss Colms,” Waxillium said softly, “what do your statistics tell you\nabout this kind of violence?”\nOh, so we’re using last names now, are we? “Very little. I can count on\nthe fingers of one hand the number of times something like this has\nhappened. The first place I’d look is for connections between the people\nkilled. Were they all in smuggling, Captain Aradel?”\n“No,” he said from behind. “Some smugglers, some extortionists, some\ngambling tycoons.”\n“So it’s not a specific attempt to consolidate power in a certain type of\ncriminal activity,” Marasi said, her voice echoing in the damp stone\nstairwell. “We need to find the connection, what made these specific people\ntargets. The one most likely behind it is dead.”"

The one most likely behind it is dead.”\n“Lord Winsting,” Waxillium said. “You’re saying he lured them here,\nplanned an execution, and it went wrong?”\n“It’s one theory.”\n“He ain’t that kind of slime,” Wayne said from near the end of the line.\n“You know of Winsting?” Marasi asked, looking over her shoulder.\n“Not specifically, no,” Wayne said. “But he was a politician. Politician\nslime is different from regular slime.”\n“I find myself agreeing,” Captain Aradel said. “Though I wouldn’t put it\nso colorfully. We knew that Winsting was crooked, but in the past he kept\nmostly to small-time schemes. Selling cargo space to smugglers when it\nsuited him, some shady real-estate deals here and there. Cash in exchange\nfor political favors, mostly.\n“Recently, rumors started that he was going to put his Senate vote up for\nsale. We were investigating, with no evidence so far. Either way, killing\nthose willing to pay him would be like blasting your silver mine with\ndynamite to try finding gold.”\nThey reached the bottom of the stairwell, where they found four more\ncorpses. The guards, apparently, all killed with bullets to the head.\nWaxillium knelt. “Shot from behind, from the direction of the\nsaferoom,” he whispered. “All four, in rapid succession.”\n“Executed?” Marasi asked. “How did the killer get them to stand there\nand take it?”\n“He didn’t,” Waxillium said. “He moved too quickly for them to\nrespond.”\n“Feruchemist,” Wayne said softly. “Damn.”\nThey were called Steelrunners, Feruchemists who could store up speed.\nThey’d have to move slowly for a time, then could draw upon that reserve\nlater. Waxillium looked up. Marasi saw something in his eyes, a hunger. He\nthought his uncle was involved. That was what he thought every time a\nMetalborn committed crimes. Waxillium saw Suit’s shadow over his\nshoulder each way he turned, the specter of a man whom Waxillium hadn’t\nbeen able to stop.\nSuit still had Waxillium’s sister, best as they could tell. Marasi didn’t\nknow much of it. Waxillium wouldn’t talk about the details.\nHe stood up, expression grim, and strode to the door behind the fallen\nmen. He threw it open and entered, Marasi and Wayne close behind, to find\na single corpse slumped in an easy chair at the center of the room. His\nthroat had been slit; the blood on the front of his clothing was thick, dried\nlike paint.\n“Killed with some sort of long knife or small sword,” Aradel said.\n“Even more strange, his tongue was cut out. We’ve sent for a surgeon to try\nto tell us more of the wound. Don’t know why the killer didn’t use a gun.”\n“Because the guards were still alive then,” Waxillium said softly.\n“What?”\n“They let the killer pass,” Waxillium said, looking at the door. “It was\nsomeone they trusted, perhaps one of their number. They let the murderer"

They let the murderer\ninto the saferoom.”\n“Maybe he was just moving very quickly to get past them,” Marasi said.\n“Maybe,” Waxillium agreed. “But that door has to be unlocked from the\ninside, and it hasn’t been forced. There’s a peephole. Winsting let the\nmurderer in, and he wouldn’t have done that if the guards had been killed.\nHe’s sitting calmly in that chair—no struggle, just a quick slice from\nbehind. Either he didn’t know someone else was in here, or he trusted them.\nJudging by the way the guards fell outside, they were still focused on the\nsteps, waiting for danger to come. They were still guarding this place. My\ngut says it was one of their own, someone they let pass, who killed\nWinsting.”\n“Rusts,” Aradel said softly. “But … a Feruchemist? Are you sure?”\n“Yeah,” Wayne said, from the doorway. “This wasn’t a speed bubble.\nCan’t shoot out of one of those, mate. These fellows were killed before one\ncould turn about. Wax is right. Either this is a Feruchemist, or somebody\nfigured out how to fire out of speed bubbles—which is somethin’ we’d\nreally like to know how to do.”\n“Someone moving with Feruchemical speed explains the knife deaths\nup above,” Waxillium said, standing. “A few swift executions in the chaos,\nwhile everyone else was shooting. Quick and surgical, but the killer would\nbe safe despite the firefight. Captain Aradel, I suggest you gather the names\nof Winsting’s companions and staff. See if any corpses that should be here,\naren’t. I’ll look into the Metalborn side—Steelrunners aren’t common, even\nas Feruchemists go.”\n“And the press?” Marasi asked.\nWaxillium looked to Aradel, who shrugged. “I can’t keep a lid on this,\nLord Ladrian,” Aradel said. “Not with so many people involved. It’s going\nto get out.”\n“Let it,” Waxillium said with a sigh. “But I can’t help feeling that’s the\npoint of all this.”\n“Excuse me?” Wayne said. “I thought the point was killing folks.”\n“Lots of folks, Wayne,” Waxillium said. “A shift in power in the city.\nWere those upstairs the main target? Or was this an attack on the governor\nhimself, a sideways strike upon his house, a message of some sort? Sent to\ntell Governor Innate that even he is not beyond their reach.…” He tipped\nWinsting’s head back, looking at the gouged-out mouth. Marasi looked\naway.\n“They removed the tongue,” Waxillium whispered. “Why? What are\nyou up to, Uncle?”\n“Excuse me?” Aradel asked.\n“Nothing,” Waxillium said, dropping the head back to its slumped\nposition. “I have to go sit for a portrait. I assume you’ll be willing to send\nme a report once you’ve detailed all of this?”\n“I can do that,” Aradel said."

This wasn’t done quietly; it was done to be\nnoticed. This was a challenge. Whoever did this isn’t likely to stop here.”\nPART TWO\n5\nWayne tugged on his lucky hat. It was a coachman’s hat—something like a\nwide-brimmed bowler, only one that didn’t have three ounces of fancy\nshoved up its backside. He nodded to himself in his mirror, then wiped his\nnose. Sniffles. He’d started storing up health the day before, just after\nfinding all those corpses.\nHe already had a nice cushion of healing he could draw upon, tucked\naway in his metalmind bracers. He hadn’t needed much lately, and always\nspent days when he had a hangover as sickly as he could manage, since he\nwas going to have an awful time of it anyway. But the way things smelled,\nwith all those important folk dead, warned him. He’d soon need some\nhealing. Best to expand that cushion as he could.\nHe went light at it today, though. Because it was today, a day when he\nwas going to need some luck. He was tempted to call it the worst day of his\nlife, but that would certainly be an exaggeration. The worst day of his life\nwould be the one when he died.\nMight die today though, he thought, looping on his belt and slipping his\ndueling canes into their straps, then wiping his nose again. Can’t be certain\nyet. Every man had to die. He’d always found it odd that so many died\nwhen they were old, as logic said that was the point in their lives when\nthey’d had the most practice not dying.\nHe wandered out of his room in Wax’s mansion, idly noticing the scent\nof morning bread coming from the kitchens. He appreciated the room,\nthough he really only stayed because of the free food. Well, that and\nbecause of Wax. The man needed company to keep him from going more\nstrange.\nWayne wandered down a carpeted corridor that smelled of polished\nwood and servants who had too much time. The mansion was nice, but\nreally, a man shouldn’t live in a place that was so big; it just reminded him\nhow small he was. Give Wayne nice, cramped quarters, and he’d be happier.\nThat way he’d feel like a king, with so much stuff it crowded him.\nHe hesitated outside the door to Wax’s study. What was that sitting on\nthe stand beside the doorway? A new candelabra, pure gold, with a white\nlace doily underneath. Exactly what Wayne needed.\nHe fished in his pocket. Rich people didn’t make sense at all. That\ncandelabra was probably worth a fortune, and Wax just left it lying around.\nWayne fished in his other pocket, looking for something good to trade, and\ncame out with a pocket watch.\nAh, that, he thought, shaking it and hearing the pieces rattle inside. How\nlong since this thing actually told time? He picked up the candelabra,"

He picked up the candelabra,\npocketed the doily underneath, then put the candelabra back in place with\nthe pocket watch hanging from it. Seemed like a fair trade.\nBeen needing a new handkerchief, he thought, blowing his nose into it,\nthen pushed open the door and wandered in.\nWax stood before an easel, looking at the large artist’s sketch pad he had\nfilled with intricate plans. “Up all night, were you?” Wayne asked with a\nyawn. “Rusts, man, you make it hard to loaf about properly.”\n“I don’t see what my insomnia has to do with your laziness, Wayne.”\n“Makes me look bad, ’sall,” Wayne said, looking over Wax’s shoulder.\n“Proper loafing requires company. One man lying about is being idle; two\nmen lying about is a lunch break.”\nWax shook his head, walking over to look at some broadsheets. Wayne\nleaned in, inspecting Wax’s paper. It held long lists of ideas, some\nconnected by arrows, with a sketch of the way the bodies had fallen in both\nthe ballroom and the saferoom.\n“What’s all this, then?” Wayne asked, picking up a pencil and drawing a\nlittle stick figure with a gun shooting at all the dead bodies. His hand\ntrembled as he drew the stick gun, but otherwise it was a right good stick\nfigure.\n“Proof to me that a Steelrunner is involved,” Wax said. “Look at the\npattern of deaths in the ballroom. Four of the most powerful people in the\nroom were killed with the same gun, and they were the only ones up there\nkilled by that weapon—but it’s the same one that killed the guards outside\nthe saferoom. I’d bet those four above were shot first, dead in an eyeblink,\nso fast that it sounded like a single long shot. Thing is, judging by the\nwounds, each shot came from a different location.”\nWayne didn’t know a lot about guns, seeing as how he couldn’t try to\nuse one without his arm doing an impersonation of a carriage on a bumpy\nroad, but Wax was probably right. Wayne moved down to start sketching\nsome stick figures of topless women in the center of the picture, but Wax\nstepped over and plucked the pencil from his fingers.\n“What’s that?” Wayne asked, tapping the center of the sketch pad, where\nWax had drawn a bunch of straight lines.\n“The pattern the killer used baffles me,” Wax said. “The four people in\nthe party he shot, they all fell while in random conversations—look how\nthey were lying. Everyone else who died was part of the larger shoot-out,\nbut these four, they died while the party was still going on. But why did he\nshoot them from different directions? See, best I can guess, he fired first\nhere, killing Lady Lentin. Her dropped drink was stomped on many times\nover the next few minutes. But then the killer used his speed to move\nquickly over here and fire in another direction. Then he moved again, and\nagain. Why four shots from different places?”\n“Who was standing where he shot?”\n“The people he killed, obviously.”"

Not\nwho did he shoot, but who was he near when he shot?”\n“Ahh…” Wax said.\n“Yep. Looks to me like he was trying to set them all off,” Wayne said,\nsniffling. “Get everyone in the room shootin’ at each other. See? It’s like\nhow, to start a bar fight, you throw a bottle at some fellow and then turn to\nthe person next to you and cry out, ‘Hey, why’d you throw that bottle at that\nnice fellow? Rusts, he looks big. And now he’s comin’ for you, and—’”\n“I understand the concept,” Wax said dryly. He tapped the drawing pad.\n“You might have something.”\n“It’s not catching.”\nWax smiled, writing some notes on the side of the pad. “So the killer\nwanted to sow chaos.… He started a firefight by bouncing around the room,\nmaking it look like various parties were attacking one another. They would\nalready have been tense, suspicious of one another.…”\n“Yup. I’m a genius.”\n“You just recognized this because the killer was making others do his\nwork for him, which is an expertise of yours.”\n“As I said. Genius. So how are you going to find him?”\n“Well, I was thinking of sending you to the Village to—”\n“Not today,” Wayne said.\nWax turned to him, raising his eyebrows.\n“It’s the first of the month,” Wayne said.\n“Ah. I had forgotten. You don’t need to go every month.”\n“I do.”\nWax studied him, as if waiting for a further comment or wisecrack.\nWayne said nothing. This was actually serious. Slowly, Wax nodded. “I see.\nThen why haven’t you left yet?”\n“Well, you know,” Wayne said. “It’s like I often say…”\n“Greet every morning with a smile. That way it won’t know what you’re\nplanning to do to it?”\n“No, not that one.”\n“Until you know it ain’t true, treat every woman like she has an older\nbrother what is stronger than you are?”\n“No, not … Wait, I said that?”\n“Yes,” Wax said, turning back to his notes. “It was a very chivalrous\nmoment for you.”\n“Rusts. I should really write these things down.”\n“I believe that is another thing you often say.” Wax made a notation.\n“Unfortunately, you’d first have to learn how to write.”\n“Now, that’s unfair,” Wayne said, walking over to Wax’s desk and\npoking around in its drawers. “I can write—I know four whole letters, and\none’s not even in my name!”\nWax smiled. “Are you going to tell me what you always say?”\nWayne found a bottle in the bottom drawer and lifted it up, dropping in\nthe lace he’d taken from outside as a replacement. “If you’re going to have\nto do something awful, stop by Wax’s room and trade for some of his rum\nfirst.”\n“I don’t believe you’ve ever said that.”"

I know you hate that place.”\n“I will survive,” Wax said, grimacing.\n“Wanna piece of advice?”\n“From you? Probably not. But please feel free.”\n“You should stop by Wax’s room before you go,” Wayne said, trailing\nout toward the door, “and pinch some of his rum.”\n“The rum you just pocketed?”\nWayne hesitated, then took the rum out of his pocket. “Ah, mate. Sorry.\nTough for you.” He shook his head. Poor fellow. He pulled the door closed\nbehind him, took a pull on the rum, and continued on his way down the\nstairs and out of the mansion.\n* * *\nMarasi tugged at the collar of her jacket, glad for the seaborne wind that\nblew across her. It could get warm in her uniform—a proper one today, with\na buttoned white blouse and brown skirt to match the brown coat.\nNext to her, the newsman wasn’t so thankful for the wind. He cursed,\nthrowing a heavy chunk of iron—it looked like a piece of an old axle—onto\nhis stack of broadsheets. On the street, the traffic slowed in a moment of\ncongestion. Motorcar drivers and coachmen yelled at one another.\n“Ruin break that Tim Vashin,” the newsman grumbled, looking at the\ntraffic. “And his machines.”\n“It’s hardly his fault,” Marasi said, digging in her pocketbook.\n“It is,” the newsman said. “Motors were fine, nothing wrong with them\nfor driving in the country or on a summer afternoon. But they’re cheap\nenough now, everyone has to have one of the rusting things! A man can’t\ntake his horse two blocks without being run down half a dozen times.”\nMarasi exchanged coins for a broadsheet. The yelling subsided as the\ntraffic clot loosened, horses and machines once again flowing across the\ncobbles. She raised the broadsheet, scanning above the fold for stories.\n“Say,” the newsman said. “Weren’t you just here?”\n“I needed the afternoon edition,” Marasi said absently, walking away.\n“Cry of Outrage in the Streets!” the headline read.\nA cry like that of twisting metal sounds through Elendel as people\ntake to the streets, outraged by government corruption. One week\nafter the governor’s veto of bill 775, the so-called workers’-rights\nmanifesto, his brother Winsting Innate has been found dead after an\napparent dealing with known criminals.\nWinsting was killed in his mansion, perhaps a casualty of\nconstable action against these criminal elements. Among the fallen is\nthe notorious Dowser Maline, long suspected of running ore-\nsmuggling operations into the city, undercutting the work of honest\nmen. The constables admit no culpability for the deaths, but\nsuspicions about the mysterious circumstances have led to a general\noutcry."

The constables admit no culpability for the deaths, but\nsuspicions about the mysterious circumstances have led to a general\noutcry.\nMarasi reached into her handbag and took out the morning edition of the\nsame paper. “Mystery at Lord Winsting’s Mansion!” the headline read.\nConstables have disclosed that Lord Winsting, brother of the\ngovernor, was found dead in his mansion home last night. Little is\nknown of the mysterious circumstances of the death, though several\nmembers of high society are rumored to have been present.\nEvery other story in the paper was the same in both editions, save for\none report on the floods in the east, which had an extra line updating\ncasualty estimates. The Winsting story had nudged two others off the page,\nin part because of the size of its headline. The Elendel Daily was hardly the\nmost reputable news source in the Basin, but it did know its market. News\nstories that people agreed with, or were scared by, sold the most copies.\nMarasi hesitated on the steps of the Fourth Octant Precinct of the\nConstabulary. People flowed on the sidewalks, bustling, anxious, heads\ndown. Others loitered nearby, men in the dark jackets of teamsters, hands\nshoved in pockets, eyes shaded by peaked hats.\nOut of work, Marasi thought. Too many idle men out of work. Motorcars\nand electric lights were changing life in Elendel so quickly it seemed that\nthe common man had no hope of keeping up. Men whose families had\nworked for three generations in the same job suddenly found themselves\nunemployed. And with the labor disputes at the steel mills …\nThe governor had recently given political speeches to these men,\nmaking promises. More coach lines to compete with rail lines, going places\nthe railroad could not. Higher tariffs on imports from Bilming. Empty\npromises, mostly, but men losing hope clung to such promises. Winsting’s\ndeath could dash those promises. How would people react if they began to\nwonder if the governor, Replar Innate, was as corrupt as his brother?\nA fire is kindling in the city, Marasi thought. She could almost feel the\nheat coming off the page of the broadsheet in her hands.\nShe turned and entered the constabulary offices, worrying that Lord\nWinsting might actually do more harm to Elendel dead than he had alive—\nwhich was saying something.\n* * *\nWax climbed out of the carriage, nodding to his coachman and indicating\nthat the man should continue on home rather than wait for his master.\nWax pulled on his aluminum-lined hat—broad-brimmed, Roughs style,\nmatching his duster, though he wore a fine shirt and cravat underneath. The\nhat and mistcoat made him stand out like a man who had brought a shotgun\nto a knife fight. Workers passed in suspenders and caps, bankers in vests\nand monocles, constables in helms or bowlers and militaristic coats.\nNo Roughs hats.

        "text": "shut up about the importance of a hat. Wax took a deep breath, then stepped\ninto the Village.\nIt had probably once been just an ordinary city street. A wide one, but\nstill just a street. That was before the trees. They sprouted here, pushing\ncobblestones aside, creating a dense canopy that ran the length of the\nthoroughfare.\nIt was a place that felt like it shouldn’t be. No mere park—this was a\nforest, uncultivated and unmanicured, fresh and primal. You couldn’t bring\na carriage or motor into the Village; even without the trees, the ground\nwould be too rough now, rolling and uneven. The buildings along the street\nhad been engulfed and become the property of the Village. He couldn’t help\nwondering if this was what all of Elendel would be like without the hand of\nmen. Harmony had made the Basin ferociously fecund; men didn’t farm\nhere so much as fight to harvest quickly enough.\nWax strode forward, arrayed as if for battle. Vindication and his Sterrion\nat his hips, short-barreled shotgun in its holster on his thigh, metal burning\ninside of him. He pulled the brim of his hat low, and entered another world.\nChildren wearing simple white smocks played among the trees. Older\nyouths wore the tinningdar, the Terris robe marked with a V pattern running\ndown the front. These looked up from the steps of buildings to watch him\npass. The air smelled soft here. Soft air. A stupid metaphor, and yet there it\nwas. That smell reminded him of his mother.\nWhispers rose around Wax like spring shoots. He kept his eyes forward,\ntrudging across the too-springy ground. There were no gates into or out of\nthe Village, yet you couldn’t enter or leave without being identified. Indeed,\nmoments after his entry, a young woman with streaming golden hair was\nsent running ahead of him to bear news of his arrival.\nThey’ve found peace for themselves here, Wax thought. They’ve made\npeace for themselves. You shouldn’t resent them so.\nAfter a short walk, he emerged from a stand of trees to find three\nTerrismen waiting for him, arms folded, all wearing the robes of Brutes,\nFeruchemists who could increase their strength. Their features were varied\nenough that one wouldn’t have pegged them as relatives. Two had the\nheight that was often the Terris heritage, and one had skin that was darker—\nsome of the Originators from ancient Terris had been dark of skin; Wax’s\nown tan probably came from that lineage. None of the men here had the\nelongated features seen in the ancient paintings. That was a thing of\nmythology.\n“What is it you need, outsider?” one of the men said.\n“I want to speak with the Synod,” Wax said.\n“Are you a constable?” the man said, looking Wax up and down.\nChildren peeked out from behind nearby trees, watching him.\n“Of a sort,” Wax said.\n“The Terris police themselves,” another of the men said. “We have an\narrangement.”\n“I’m aware of the compact,” Wax said. “I just need to speak to the\nSynod, or at least Elder Vwafendal.”\n“You shouldn’t be here, lawman,” the lead Terrisman said. “I—”"

Stately and white-haired, she had darker skin than Wax, and\nwalked with a cane she didn’t need. The woman, Vwafendal, studied Wax.\nHe found himself sweating.\nRazal, still bowing, spoke with a stubborn tone. “We tried to send him\naway, Elder.”\n“He has a right to be here,” Vwafendal said. “He has as much Terris\nblood as you do; more than most.”\nThe Terrisman Brute started, then rose from his bow, peering again at\nWax. “You don’t mean…”\n“Yes,” Vwafendal said, looking very tired. “This is he. My grandson.”\n* * *\nWayne tipped the rum bottle up and teased the last few drops out into his\nmouth. Then he tucked the bottle into his coat pocket. It was a good bottle.\nHe should be able to trade it for something.\nHe hopped off the canal boat, giving a wave to Red, the boatman. Nice\nchap. He would let Wayne bum rides in exchange for a story. Wayne spat a\ncoin out of his mouth—he’d been keeping it in his cheek—and flipped it to\nRed.\nRed caught the coin. “Why is this wet? Were you sucking on it?”\n“Allomancers can’t Push on my coin if it’s in my mouth!” Wayne called.\n“You’re drunk, Wayne!” Red said with a laugh, shoving off from the\ndock with his pole.\n“Not nearly drunk enough,” Wayne called back. “That cheapskate Wax\ndidn’t even have the decency to stock a full bottle!”\nRed turned the canal boat, poling it out into the waters, wind rippling his\ncloak. Wayne walked away from the post marking the canal-side mooring,\nand was faced with the most intimidating sight a fellow could see. The\nElendel University.\nIt was time for Wayne’s three tests.\nHe reached for the rum, then remembered—a little foggily—that he’d\nfinished it all. “Rust and Ruin,” he muttered. Perhaps he shouldn’t have\ndowned the whole thing. Then again, it made his sniffles easy to ignore.\nWhen he was properly smashed, he could take a punch or two to the face\nand not even feel it. There was a kind of invincibility to that. A stupid kind,\nbut Wayne wasn’t a picky man.\nHe made his way up to the university gates, hands stuffed in his coat\npockets.

        "text": "Two men in black coats leaned casually against the gates. Wayne\nhesitated. So they were watching for him out front this time, were they? The\nfirst of his three trials was upon him. Rusting wonderful.\nWell, after the nature of any great hero from the stories, he was going to\ndo his best to avoid this particular trial. Wayne ducked to the side before the\ntwo men could spot him, then followed the wall. The university was\nsurrounded by the thing, like it was some kind of bunker. Were they afraid\nall their knowledge would leak out, like water from a swimmer’s ears?\nWayne craned his neck, looking for a way in. They’d bricked up the\nbroken part he’d used last time. And the tree he’d climbed that other time\nhad been cut down. Drat on them for that. He decided to follow another\ngreat tradition of heroes facing trials. He went looking for a way to cheat.\nHe found Dims on a nearby corner. The young man wore a bowler hat\nand a bow tie, but a shirt that had the sleeves ripped off. He was head of one\nof the more important street gangs in the area, but never stabbed people too\nbadly when he mugged them and was polite with the people he extorted. He\nwas practically a model citizen.\n“Hello, Dims,” Wayne said.\nDims eyed him. “You a conner today, Wayne?”\n“Nope.”\n“Ah, good,” Dims said, settling down on the steps. He took something\nout of his pocket—a little metal container.\n“Here now,” Wayne said, wiping his nose. “What’s that?”\n“Gum.”\n“Gum?”\n“Yeah, you chew it.” Dims offered him a piece of the stuff. It was rolled\ninto a ball, soft to the touch and powdered on the outside.\nWayne eyed the lad, but decided to try it. He chewed for a moment.\n“Good flavor,” he said, then swallowed.\nDims laughed. “You don’t swallow it, Wayne. You just chew!”\n“What’s the funna that?”\n“It just feels good.” He tossed Wayne another ball.\nWayne popped it into his mouth. “How are things,” Wayne said, “with\nyou and the Cobblers?”\nThe Cobblers were the rival gang in the area. Dims and his fellows went\nabout with their sleeves torn. The Cobblers wore no shoes. It apparently\nmade perfect sense to youths of the street, many of whom were the children\nof the houseless. Wayne liked to keep an eye on them. They were good lads.\nHe’d been like them once.\nThen life had steered him wrong. Boys like this, they could use\nsomeone to point them in the right direction.\n“Oh, you know,” Dims said. “Some back, some forth.”\n“There won’t be trouble now, will there?” Wayne asked.\n“I thought you said you wasn’t no conner today!”\n“I ain’t,” Wayne said, slipping—by instinct—into a dialect more like\nthat of Dims. “I’m askin’ as a friend, Dims.”\nDims scowled, looking away, but his muttered response was genuine.\n“We ain’t stupid, Wayne. We’ll keep our heads. You know we will.”\n“Good.”\nDims glanced back at him as Wayne settled down. “You bring that\nmoney you owe me?”"

You know we will.”\n“Good.”\nDims glanced back at him as Wayne settled down. “You bring that\nmoney you owe me?”\n“I owe you money?” Wayne asked.\n“From cards?” Dims said. “Two weeks back? Rusts, Wayne, are you\ndrunk? It ain’t even noon yet!”\n“I ain’t drunk,” Wayne said, sniffling. “I’m investigatin’ alternative\nstates of sobriety. How much do I owe you?”\nDims paused. “Twenty.”\n“Now see,” Wayne said, digging in his pocket, “I distinctly remember\nborrowin’ five off you.” He held up a note. It was a fifty.\nDims raised an eyebrow. “You want something from me, I’m guessing?”\n“I need into the university.”\n“The gates are open,” Dims said.\n“Can’t go through the front. They know me.”\nDims nodded. That sort of thing was a common complaint in his world.\n“What do you need from me?”\nA short time later, a man wearing Wayne’s hat, coat, and dueling canes\ntried to pass through the front of the university. He saw the two men in\nblack, then bolted as they chased after him.\nWayne adjusted his spectacles, watching them go. He shook his head.\nRuffians, trying to get into the university! Scandalous. He walked in\nthrough the gates, wearing a bow tie and carrying a load of books. Another\nof those men—who stood in a more hidden spot, watching his companions\nchase Dims—barely gave Wayne a glance.\nSpectacles. They were kind of like a hat for smart people. Wayne\nditched the books inside the square, then walked past a fountain with a\nstatue of a lady who wasn’t properly clothed—he idled only a short time—\nand made his way toward Pashadon Hall, the girls’ dormitory. The building\nlooked an awful lot like a prison: three stories of small windows, stonework\narchitecture, and iron grates that seemed to say “Stay away, boys, if you\nvalue your nether parts.”\nHe pushed his way in the front doors, where he prepared himself for the\nsecond of his three tests: the Tyrant of Pashadon. She sat at her desk, a\nwoman built like an ox with a face to match. Her hair even curled like\nhorns. She was a fixture of the university, or so Wayne had been told.\nPerhaps she had come with the chandeliers and sofas.\nShe looked up from her desk in the entryway, then threw herself to her\nfeet in challenge. “You!”\n“Hello,” Wayne said.\n“How did you get past campus security!”\n“I tossed them a ball,” Wayne said, tucking the spectacles into his\npocket. “Most hounds love having somethin’ to chase.”\nThe tyrant rumbled around the side of her desk. It was like watching an\nocean liner try to navigate city canals. She wore a tiny hat, in an attempt at\nfashion. She liked to consider herself a part of Elendel upper society, and\nshe kind of was. In the same way that the blocks of granite that made up the\nsteps to the governor’s mansion were a part of civic government."

In the same way that the blocks of granite that made up the\nsteps to the governor’s mansion were a part of civic government.\n“You,” she said, spearing Wayne in the chest with a finger. “I thought I\ntold you not to come back.”\n“I thought I ignored you.”\n“Are you drunk?” She sniffed at his breath.\n“No,” Wayne said. “If I were drunk, you wouldn’t look nearly so ugly.”\nShe huffed, turning away. “I can’t believe your audacity.”\n“Really? Because I’m sure I’ve been this audacious before. Every\nmonth, in fact. So this seems a right believable thing for me to do.”\n“I’m not letting you in. Not this time. You are a scoundrel.”\nWayne sighed. Heroes in stories never had to fight the same beast twice.\nSeemed unfair he had to face this one each month. “Look, I just want to\ncheck in on her.”\n“She is fine.”\n“I have money,” Wayne said. “To give her.”\n“You can leave it here. You distress the girl, miscreant.”\nWayne stepped forward, taking the tyrant by the shoulder. “I didn’t want\nto have to do this.”\nShe looked at him. And, to his surprise, she cracked her knuckles. Wow.\nHe reached into his pocket quickly and pulled out a piece of pasteboard.\n“One ticket,” Wayne said quickly, “admitting two people to the\ngovernor’s spring dinner and policy speech, occurring during a party at\nLady ZoBell’s penthouse tonight. This here ticket lists no specific names.\nAnyone who has it can get in.”\nHer eyes widened. “Who’d you steal that from?”\n“Please,” Wayne said. “It came delivered to my house.”\nWhich was perfectly true. It was for Wax and Steris. But they were\nimportant enough folk that invitations sent to them had no names, so they\ncould send an emissary if they wished. When it came to someone fancy like\nWax, even getting their relative or friend to attend your party could be\nadvantageous.\nThe tyrant didn’t count as either. But Wayne figured that Wax would be\nhappy to not have to go to the blasted party anyway. Besides, Wayne had\nleft a real nice-looking leaf he’d found in exchange. Rusting beautiful, that\nleaf was.\nThe tyrant hesitated, so Wayne waved the ticket in front of her.\n“I guess…” she said. “I could let you in one last time. I’m not supposed\nto allow unrelated men into the visiting room, however.”\n“I’m practically family,” he said. They made a big fuss about keeping\nthe young women and young men separated around here, which Wayne\nfound odd. With all of these smart people around, wouldn’t one of them\nhave realized what boys and girls was supposed to do together?\nThe tyrant let him pass into the visiting room, then sent one of the girls\nat the desk to run for Allriandre. Wayne sat down, but couldn’t keep his feet\nfrom tapping. He’d been stripped of weapons, bribes, and even his own hat.\nHe was practically naked, but he’d made it to the final test.\nAllriandre entered a few moments later. She’d brought backup with her\nin the form of two other young ladies about her age—just shy of twenty."

She’d brought backup with her\nin the form of two other young ladies about her age—just shy of twenty.\nSmart girl, Wayne thought, proud. He rose.\n“Madam Penfor says you’re drunk,” Allriandre said, remaining in the\ndoorway.\nWayne tapped his metalmind, drawing forth healing. In a moment, his\nbody burned away its impurities and healed its wounds. It thought alcohol\nwas a poison, which showed that a fellow couldn’t always trust his own\nbody, but today he didn’t complain. It also washed away his sniffles for the\nmoment, though those would return. It was hard to heal from diseases with\na metalmind for some reason.\nEither way, sobriety hit him like a brick to the chin. He inhaled deeply,\nfeeling even more naked than before. “I just like to play with her,” Wayne\nsaid, all hint of slur gone from his voice, eyes focused.\nAllriandre studied him intently, then nodded. She did not enter the\nroom.\n“I brought this month’s money,” Wayne said, taking an envelope out and\nsetting it on the low, glass-topped table beside him. He stood up straight,\nthen shuffled from one foot to the other.\n“Is that really him?” one of the girls asked Allriandre. “They say he\nrides with Dawnshot. Of the Roughs.”\n“It’s him,” Allriandre said, eyes still on Wayne. “I don’t want your\nmoney.”\n“Your mama told me to bring it to you,” Wayne said.\n“You don’t need to bring it in person.”\n“I do,” Wayne said quietly.\nThey stood in silence, neither party moving. Wayne finally cleared his\nthroat. “How’re your studies? Are you treated well here? Is there anythin’\nyou need?”\nAllriandre reached into her handbag and took out a large locket. She\nspread it open, displaying a strikingly distinct evanotype of a man with a\nwide mustache and a twinkle in his eyes. He had a long, friendly face, and\nhis hair was thinning on top. Her father.\nShe made Wayne look at it every time.\n“Tell me what you did,” she said. That voice. It could have been the\nvoice of winter itself.\n“I don’t—”\n“Tell me.”\nThe third trial.\n“I killed your daddy,” Wayne said softly, looking at the picture. “I\nmugged him in an alley for his pocketbook. I shot a better man than me, and\nbecause of that, I don’t deserve to be alive.”\n“You know you aren’t forgiven.”\n“I know.”\n“You will never be forgiven.”\n“I know.”\n“Then I’ll take your blood money,” Allriandre said. “If you care to\nknow, my studies go well. I am thinking of taking up the law.”\nSomeday, he hoped he might be able to look into the girl’s eyes and see\nemotion. Hatred, maybe. Something other than that emptiness.\n“Get out.”\nWayne ducked his head and left.\n* * *\nThere should not have been a thatched log hut in the middle of Elendel, and\nyet here it was.

        "text": "* * *\nThere should not have been a thatched log hut in the middle of Elendel, and\nyet here it was. Wax stooped to enter, seeming to step backward in time\nhundreds of years. The air inside smelled of old leather and furs.\nThe enormous firepit in the middle would never be needed in Elendel’s\nmild weather. Today, a smaller fire had been constructed at its very center,\nand over it simmered a small kettle of hot water for tea. However, charred\nstones indicated that the entire firepit was sometimes used. It, the furs, the\nancient-style paintings on the wall—of winds, and frozen rain, and tiny\nfigures painted with simple strokes on slopes—were all fragments of a\nmyth.\nOld Terris. A legendary land of snow and ice, with white-furred beasts\nand spirits that haunted frozen storms. During the early days following the\nCatacendre, refugees from Terris had written down memories of their\nhomeland, as no Keepers had remained.\nWax settled down beside his grandmother’s firepit. Some said that Old\nTerris waited for this people, hidden somewhere in this new world of\nHarmony’s design. To the faithful, it might as well have been paradise; a\nfrozen, hostile paradise. Living in a land naturally lush with bounteous fruit,\nwhere little cultivation was required, could warp one’s vision.\nGrandmother V settled down opposite him, but did not start the fire.\n“Did you remove your guns before entering the Village this time?”\n“I did not.”\nShe snorted. “So insolent. During your long absence, I often wondered\nif the Roughs might temper you.”\n“They made me more stubborn, is all.”\n“A land of heat and death,” Grandmother V said. She crinkled a handful\nof herbs, flakes dropping into a tea strainer above her cup. She poured\nsteaming water over them, then placed the lid with a gnarled hand.\n“Everything about you stinks of death, Asinthew.”\n“That isn’t what my father named me.”\n“Your father didn’t have the right. I would demand you remove the\nweapons, but it would be meaningless. You could kill with a coin, or with a\nbutton, or with this pot.”\n“Allomancy is not so evil as you make it out to be, Grandmother.”\n“Neither power is evil,” she said. “It is mixing those powers that is\ndangerous. Your nature is not your fault, but I cannot help but see it as a\nsign. Another tyrant in our future, too powerful. It leads to death.”\nSitting in this hut … the scent of Grandmother’s tea … Memories\ngrabbed Wax by his collar and shoved him face-first up against his past. A\nyoung man who had never been able to decide what he was. Allomancer or\nFeruchemist, city lord or humble Terrisman? His father and uncle pushing\nhim one way, his grandmother another.\n“A Feruchemist slaughtered people in the Fourth Octant last night,\nGrandmother,” Wax said. “He was a Steelrunner. I know you track everyone\nin the city with Feruchemical blood. I need a list of names.”\nGrandmother V swished around her tea. “You’ve visited the Village\non … what, a mere three occasions since your return to the city? Nearly two"

Nearly two\nyears, and you’ve made time for your grandmother only twice before\ntoday.”\n“Can you blame me, considering how these meetings usually go? To be\nblunt, Grandmother, I know how you feel about me. So why torture either\nof us?”\n“You cling to your images of me from two decades ago, child. People\nchange. Even one such as I.” She sipped her tea, then added more herbs to\nthe strainer and lowered it back into the water. She would not drink until it\nwas right. “Not one such as you, it appears.”\n“Trying to bait me, Grandmother?”\n“No. I am better at insults than that. You haven’t changed. You still\ndon’t know who you are.”\nAn old argument. She’d said it to him both times they’d met during the\nlast two years. “I am not going to start wearing Terris robes, speaking softly,\nquoting proverbs at people.”\n“You will shoot them instead.”\nWax took a deep breath. A mixture of scents lingered in the air. From the\ntea? Scents like that of freshly cut grass. His father’s estates, sitting on the\nlawn, listening to his father and grandmother argue.\nWax had lived here in the Village for only a single year. It had been all\nhis father had agreed to give. Even that had been surprising; Uncle Edwarn\nhad wanted Wax and his sister to both stay away from the place. Before his\nofficial heir, the late Hinston Ladrian, had been born when Wax was\neighteen, Edwarn had basically appropriated his brother’s children and tried\nto raise them. Even still, it was hard to separate Wax’s parents’ will in his\nhead from that of Edwarn.\nOne year among these trees. Wax had been forbidden Allomancy during\nhis days in the Village, but had learned something far greater. That\ncriminals existed, even among the idyllic Terris.\n“The only times I’ve truly known who I am,” Wax said, looking up at\nhis grandmother, meeting her eyes, “are when I’ve put on the mistcoat,\nstrapped guns to my waist, and hunted down men gone rabid.”\n“You should not be defined by what you do, but by what you are.”\n“A man is what he does.”\n“You came looking for a Feruchemist killer? You need only look in the\nmirror, child. If a man is what he does … think of what you’ve done.”\n“I’ve never killed a man who didn’t deserve it.”\n“Can you be absolutely certain of that?”\n“Reasonably. If I’ve made mistakes, I’ll pay for them someday. You\nwon’t distract me, Grandmother. To fight is not against the Terris way.\nHarmony killed.”\n“He slew beasts and monsters only. Never our own.”\nWax breathed out. This again? Rusts. I should have forced Wayne to\ncome here instead of me. He says she actually likes him.\nA new scent struck him. Crushed blossoms. In the darkness of that\nchamber, he imagined himself again, standing among the trees of the Terris\nVillage. Looking up at a broken window, and feeling the bullet in his hand."

Once that memory had brought him pain—the pain of\nisolation. Now he saw only a budding lawman, remembered the sense of\npurpose he’d felt.\nWax stood up, grabbing his hat, mistcoat rustling. He almost wanted to\nbelieve that the scents to the room, the memories, were his grandmother’s\ndoing. Who knew what she put into that tea?\n“I’m going to hunt down a murderer,” Wax said. “If I do it without your\nhelp, and he kills again before I can stop him, you will be partially to\nblame. See how well you sleep at night then, Grandmother.”\n“Will you kill him?” she asked. “Will you shoot for the chest when you\ncould aim for the leg? People die around you. Do not deny it.”\n“I don’t,” he said. “A man should never pull a trigger unless he’s willing\nto kill. And if the other fellow is armed, I’m going to aim for the chest. That\nway, when people do die around me, it’s the right ones.”\nGrandmother V stared at her teapot. “The one you’re looking for is\nnamed Idashwy. And she is not a man.”\n“Steelrunner?”\n“Yes. She is not a killer.”\n“But—”\n“She is the only Steelrunner I know of who could possibly be involved\nin something like this. She vanished about a month ago after acting … very\nerratically. Claimed that she was being visited by the spirit of her dead\nbrother.”\n“Idashwy,” he said. It was pronounced in the Terris manner, eye-dash-\nwee. The syllables felt thick in his mouth, another reminder of his days in\nthe Village. The Terris language had been dead once, but Harmony’s\nrecords included it, and many Terris now learned to speak it in their youths.\n“I swear I know that name.”\n“You did know her, long ago,” Grandmother V said. “You were with her\nthat night, actually, before…”\nAh yes. Slender, golden hair, shy and didn’t speak much. I didn’t know\nshe was a Feruchemist.\n“You don’t even have the decency to look ashamed,” Grandmother V\nsaid.\n“I’m not,” Wax said. “Hate me if you must, Grandmother, but coming to\nlive with you changed my life, just as you always promised it would. I’m\nnot going to be ashamed that the transformation wasn’t the one you\nexpected.”\n“Just … try to bring her back, Asinthew. She’s not a killer. She’s\nconfused.”\n“They all are,” Wax said, stepping out of the hut. The three men from\nbefore stood outside, glaring at him with displeasure. Wax tipped his hat to\nthem, dropped a coin, then launched himself into the air between two trees,\npassing their canopies and seeking the sky.\n* * *\nEach time Marasi entered the precinct offices, she got a little thrill.\nIt was the thrill of bucked expectations, of a future denied.

Even though\nthis room didn’t look like she’d imagined—as the clerical and\norganizational center for the octant’s constables, it felt more like a business\noffice than anything else—the mere fact that she was here excited her.\nThis wasn’t supposed to have been her life. She’d grown up reading\nstories of the Roughs, of lawmen and villains. She’d dreamed of six-guns\nand stagecoaches. She’d even taken up horseback riding and rifle shooting.\nAnd then, real life had intervened.\nShe’d been born into privilege. Yes, she was illegitimate, but the\ngenerous stipend from her father had set her and her mother up in a fine\nhome. Money for an education had been guaranteed for her. With that kind\nof promise—and with her mother’s determination that Marasi should enter\nsociety and prove herself to her father—one did not choose a profession so\nlowly as that of a constable.\nYet here she was. It was wonderful.\nShe passed through the room full of people at desks. Though a jail was\nattached to the building, it had its own entrance, and she rarely visited it.\nMany of the constables she passed on her way through the main chamber\nwere the type who spent most of their days at a desk. Her own spot was a\ncomfortable nook near Captain Aradel’s office. His room felt like a closet\ninside, and Aradel rarely spent time there. Instead, he stalked through the\nmain chamber like a prowling lion, always in motion.\nMarasi set her handbag on her desk next to a stack of last year’s crime\nreports—in her spare time, she was trying to judge to what extent petty\ncrimes in a region foretold greater ones. Better that than reading the politely\nangry letters from her mother, which lay underneath. She peeked into the\ncaptain’s office and found his waistcoat thrown across his desk, right beside\nthe pile of expense reports he was supposed to be initialing. She smiled and\nshook her head, dug his pocket watch out of his waistcoat, then went\nhunting.\nThe offices were busy, but they didn’t have the bustle of the\nprosecutor’s offices. During her internship there beneath Daius, everyone\nhad always seemed so frantic. People worked all hours, and when a new\ncase was posted, every junior solicitor in the room rushed over in a flurry of\npapers, coats, and skirts, craning to see who had posted the case and how\nmany assistants they would be taking.\nThe opportunities for prestige, and even wealth, had been bountiful. And\nyet she hadn’t been able to shake the feeling that nobody was actually doing\nanything. Cases that could make a difference languished because they\nweren’t high-profile enough, while anything under the patronage of a\nprominent lord or lady was seen to immediately. The rush had been less\nabout fixing the city’s problems, and more about making certain the senior\nsolicitors saw how much more eager you were than your colleagues.\nShe’d probably still be there, if she hadn’t met Waxillium. She’d have\ndone as her mother wanted, seeking validation through her child. Proof,\nperhaps, that she could have married Lord Harms, if it had been in the\ncards, despite her low birth.

She loved her mother,\nbut the woman simply had too much time on her hands.\nThe constables’ offices were so different from the solicitors’. Here, there\nwas a true sense of purpose, but it was measured, even thoughtful.\nConstables leaned back in chairs and described evidence to other officers,\nlooking for help on a case. Junior corporals moved through the room,\ndelivering cups of tea, fetching files, or running some other errand. The\ncompetition she’d felt among the solicitors barely existed here. Perhaps that\nwas because there was little prestige, and even less wealth, to go around.\nShe found Aradel with sleeves rolled up, one foot on a chair, bothering\nLieutenant Caberel. “No, no,” Aradel said. “I’m telling you, we need more\nmen on the streets. Near the pubs, at nights, where the foundry workers\ncongregate after the strike line breaks up. Don’t bother guarding them\nduring the day.”\nCaberel nodded placidly, though she gave Marasi a roll of the eyes as\nshe walked up. Aradel did tend to micromanage, but at least he was earnest.\nIn Marasi’s experience, they were almost all fond of him, eyerolls\nnotwithstanding.\nShe plucked a cup of tea off the plate of a passing corporal, who was\ndelivering them to the desks. He quickly moved on, eyes forward, but she\ncould almost feel him glaring at her. Well, it wasn’t her fault she’d landed\nthis position, and the rank of lieutenant, without ever having to deliver tea.\nAll right, she admitted to herself, sipping the tea and stepping up beside\nAradel. Maybe there is a bit of competition around here.\n“You’ll see this done, then?” Aradel asked.\n“Of course, sir,” Caberel said. She was one of the few in the place who\ntreated Marasi with any measure of respect. Perhaps it was because they\nwere both women.\nThere were fewer women in the constabulary than among the solicitors.\nOne might have guessed that the reason for this was that ladies weren’t\ninterested in the violence—but having done both jobs, Marasi felt she knew\nwhich profession was bloodier. And it wasn’t the one where people carried\nguns.\n“Good, good,” Aradel said. “I have a debriefing with Captain Reddi\nin…” He patted at his pocket.\nMarasi held out his watch, which he grabbed and checked for the time.\n“… fifteen minutes. Huh. More time than I expected. Where’d you get\nthat tea, Colms?”\n“Want me to have someone fetch you some?” she asked.\n“No, no. I can do it.” He bustled off, and Marasi nodded to Caberel,\nthen hurried after him.\n“Sir,” she said, “have you seen the afternoon broadsheets?”\nHe held out his hand, which she filled with paper. He held up the stack\nof broadsheets, and almost ran over three different constables on his way to\nthe stove and the tea. “Bad,” he muttered. “I’d hoped they’d spin this\nagainst us.”\n“Us, sir?” Marasi asked, surprised."

By the end, the tone is far more outraged against\nWinsting than us.”\n“And that’s worse than outrage at us for a cover-up?”\n“Far worse, Lieutenant,” he said with a grimace, reaching for a cup.\n“People are used to hating conners. We’re a magnet for it, a lightning rod.\nBetter us than the governor.”\n“Unless the governor deserves it, sir.”\n“Dangerous words, Lieutenant,” Aradel said, filling his cup with\nsteaming tea from the large urn kept warm atop the coal stove. “And likely\ninappropriate.”\n“You know there are rumors that he’s corrupt,” Marasi said softly.\n“What I know is that we are civil servants,” Aradel said. “There are\nenough people out there with the mindset and the moral position to monitor\nthe government. Our job is to keep the peace.”\nMarasi frowned, but said nothing. Governor Innate was corrupt, she was\nalmost sure of it. There were too many coincidences, too many small\noddities in his policy decisions. It wasn’t by any means obvious, but trends\nwere Marasi’s specialty, and her passion.\nIt wasn’t as if she’d wanted to discover that the leader of Elendel was\ntrading favors with the city’s elite, but once she’d spotted the signs, she’d\nfelt compelled to dig in. On her desk, carefully hidden under a stack of\nordinary reports, was a ledger in which she’d assembled all the information.\nNothing concrete, but the picture it drew was clear to her—even though she\nunderstood that it would look innocent to anyone else.\nAradel studied her. “You disagree with my opinion, Lieutenant?”\n“One doesn’t change the world by avoiding the hard questions, sir.”\n“Feel free to ask them, then. In your head, Lieutenant, and not out loud\n—particularly not to people outside the precinct. We can’t have the men we\nwork for thinking we are trying to undermine them.”\n“Funny, sir,” Marasi said. “I thought we worked for the people of the\ncity, not their leaders.”\nAradel stopped, cup of steaming tea halfway to his lips. “Suppose I\ndeserved that,” he said, then took a gulp, shaking his head. He didn’t flinch\nat the heat. People in the office figured he’d seared his taste buds off years\nago. “Let’s go.”\nThey wove through the room toward Aradel’s office, passing Captain\nReddi at his desk. The lanky man rose, but Aradel waved him down, pulling\nout his watch. “I still have … five minutes until I have to deal with you,\nReddi.”\nMarasi shot the captain an apologetic smile. She got a scowl in return.\n“Someday,” she noted, “I’m going to figure out why that man hates me.”\n“Hmmm?” Aradel said. “Oh, you stole his job.”\nMarasi missed a step, stumbling into Lieutenant Ahlstrom’s desk."

He’s a field constable, a senior detective.”\n“Everyone has this idea that in order to move up, you need to spend\nmore time in the office and less on the street,” Aradel said. “Stupid\ntradition, even if the other octants follow it. I don’t want my best men and\nwomen turning into desk slugs. I want the assistant position to be for\nnurturing someone fresh who shows promise, rather than letting some\npracticed constable gather moss.”\nThe realization made a lot of things lock into place for Marasi. The\nhostility she felt from many of the others wasn’t just because she’d skipped\nthe lower ranks—many with noble titles did that. It was because they’d\nsolidified behind Reddi, their friend who’d been slighted.\n“So…” Marasi said, taking a deep breath and grasping for something to\nkeep her from a panic. “You think I show promise then?”\n“Of course I do. Why would I have hired you otherwise?” Corporal\nMaindew walked by, saluting, and Aradel threw the wadded broadsheets\ninto his face. “No saluting indoors, Maindew. You’ll knock yourself\nunconscious slapping your forehead every time I walk past.” He glanced\nback at Marasi as Maindew mumbled an apology and rushed off.\n“There’s something in you, Colms,” Aradel told her. “Not the gloss and\nglint of the application. I don’t care about your grades, or what those\nzinctongues in the solicitors’ office thought of you. The words you wrote\nabout changing the city, those made sense. They impressed me.”\n“I … Thank you for the praise, sir.”\n“I’m not flattering you, Colms. It’s just a fact.” He pointed toward the\ndoor. “That broadsheet said the governor was going to address the city later\nthis afternoon. I’ll bet the Second Octant constables ask us for help\nmanaging the crowds; they always do. So I’m going to send a street detail.\nGo with them and listen, then report back to me what Governor Innate says,\nand pay attention to how the crowd reacts.”\n“Yes, sir,” Marasi said, stopping herself from saluting as she snatched\nher handbag and ran to follow the orders.\n“GENTLEMAN JAK IN THE CITY\nOF FOUNTAINS”\nPart Six\n“The Sinister Soiree!”\nI need not remind my astute readers of the precarious situation in which I was left at the end of last\nweek’s column, but for those of you whose heightened tastes have just now led them from the gutters\nof disgraceful journalism to the noble pages of The House Record, let me present a short\nrecapitulation.\nThrough the efforts alone of my silver tongue and tin-quick mind, I gained access to Lady"

        "text": "the otherwise green copper statue. Women sat on its stone edge; children\nplayed in its waters. Motorcars and horse carriages broke around it,\nsweeping to the sides and charging down other roads, going about the ever-\nimportant business of city life.\nSo many people—and here, in the Fourth Octant, a frightening\npercentage of them were his responsibility. To begin with he paid their\nwages, or oversaw those who did; on the solvency of his house rested the\nfinancial stability of thousands upon thousands. But that was only part of it;\nbecause through his seat in the Senate, he represented any who worked for\nhim, or who lived on properties he owned.\nTwo divisions within the Senate. One side, the representatives of the\nprofessions, was elected and came and went as people’s needs changed. The\nother side, the seats of the noble houses, was stable and immutable—not\nsubject to the whims of voters. The governor, elected by the seats, presided\nover them all.\nA good enough system, except it meant that Wax was supposed to look\nafter tens of thousands of individuals he could never know. His eye\ntwitched, and he turned, Pushing off some rebar sloppily left sticking from a\ntenement wall.\nTowns were better in the Roughs, where you could know everyone. That\nway you could care for them, and really feel you were doing something.\nMarasi would argue that statistically, leading his house here was more\neffective in creating general human happiness, but he wasn’t a man of\nnumbers; he was a man who trusted his gut. His gut missed knowing the\npeople he served.\nWax landed on a large water tower near a glass dome covering his\noctant’s largest Church of the Survivor. People were worshipping inside,\nthough a greater number would come at dusk to await the mists. The\nChurch revered the mists, and yet with that glass dome they still separated\nthemselves from it. Wax shook his head, then Pushed off along the nearby\ncanal.\nHe’s probably finished by now, Wax thought. He’ll be on one of the\nnearby docks, listening to the lapping water.…\nHe continued along the canal, which was cluttered with boats. Tindwyl\nPromenade, which ran along this canal, was crowded—even more so than\nusual. Dense with life. It was difficult not to feel subsumed by the great city,\nengulfed, overwhelmed, insignificant. Out in the Roughs Wax hadn’t just\nenforced the law; he had interpreted it, revised it when needed. He had been\nthe law.\nHere he had to dance around egos and secrets.\nAs Wax searched for the right dock, he was surprised to eventually find\nthe reason for the traffic on the promenade. It was all bunched up, trying to\nget through a large clot of men with signs. Wax passed overhead, and was\nshocked to see a small cluster of constables from the local octant amid the\npicketers—they were being pressed on all sides by the shouting men,\nwaving signs in an uncomfortably violent manner.\nWax dropped through the air and Pushed lightly on the nails in the\npromenade boards here, slowing his descent.

He landed in a crouch in an\nopening nearby, mistcoat flaring, guns clinking.\nThe picketers regarded him for a long moment, then broke apart, taking\noff in different directions. He didn’t even have to say a word. In moments\nthe beleaguered constables emerged, like stones on the plain as the soil\nwashed away in a sudden rain.\n“Thanks, sir,” said their captain, an older woman whose blonde hair\npoked down straight about an inch on all sides around her constable’s hat.\n“They’re getting violent?” Wax asked, watching the last of the picketers\nvanish.\n“Didn’t like us trying to move them off the promenade, Dawnshot,” the\nwoman said. She shivered. “Didn’t expect it to go so bad, so fast.…”\n“Can’t say I blame them much,” one of the other constables said, a\nfellow with a neck like a long-barreled pistol. His fellows turned to him,\nand he hunched down. “Look, you can’t say you don’t have mates among\nthem. You can’t say you haven’t heard them grumble. Something needs to\nchange in this city. That’s all I’m saying.”\n“They don’t have the right to block a main thoroughfare,” Wax said, “no\nmatter their grievances. Report back to your precinct, and make sure you\nbring more men next time.”\nThey nodded, hiking off. The promenade’s knot of pedestrians slowly\nunwound itself, and Wax shook his head, worried. The men running the\nstrikes did have a grievance. He’d found some of the same problematic\nconditions among the few factories he owned—long hours, dangerous\nenvironments—and had been forced to fire a few overseers because of it.\nHe’d replaced them with overseers who instead would hire more men, for\nshorter shifts, as there was no shortage of laborers in the city who were out\nof work these days. But then he’d needed to up wages, so that the men\ncould live on the shorter-shift income—making his goods more costly.\nDifficult times. And he didn’t have the answers, not to those problems.\nHe hiked along the promenade a short distance, drawing more than a\nfew stares from people he passed. But he soon found what he’d been\nlooking for. Wayne sat on a narrow dock nearby. He had his shoes and\nsocks off, feet in the water, and was staring off down the canal. “Hello,\nWax,” he said without looking as Wax stepped up.\n“It went poorly?” Wax asked.\n“Same as always. It’s strange. Most days I don’t mind being me. Today I\ndo.”\nWax crouched down, resting a hand on the younger man’s shoulder.\n“Do you ever wonder if you shoulda just shot me?” Wayne asked.\n“Back when you and Jon first found me?”\n“I’m not in the habit of shooting people who can’t shoot back,” Wax\nsaid.\n“I coulda been faking.”\n“No. You couldn’t have been.”\nWayne had been a youth of sixteen when Wax and Jon Deadfinger—a\nlawman who had been mentoring Wax—had found him curled up in the\ncrawl space under a house, hands over his ears, cloaked in dirt and\nwhimpers.

Wayne had thrown his guns and ammunition down a well. Even\nas Deadfinger had dragged him out, Wayne had been complaining of the\ngunfire. Shots only he could hear, echoing from that well.…\n“Any number of the boys we run across and take down,” Wayne said.\n“Any of them could be like me. Why did I get a second chance, but none of\nthem do?”\n“Luck.”\nWayne turned to meet his eyes.\n“I’d give those lads second chances if I could,” Wax said. “Maybe\nthey’ve had their moments of doubt, regret. But the ones we shoot, we don’t\nfind them unarmed, hiding, willing to be brought in. We find them killing.\nAnd if I’d found you in the process of armed robbery all those years ago,\nI’d have shot you too.”\n“You’re not lying, are you?”\n“Of course not. I’d have shot you right in the head, Wayne.”\n“You’re a good friend,” Wayne said. “Thanks, Wax.”\n“You’re the only person I know that I can cheer up by promising to kill\nhim.”\n“You didn’t promise to kill me,” Wayne said, pulling on his socks. “You\npromised to have killed me. That there be the present perfect tense.”\n“Your grasp of the language is startling,” Wax said, “considering how\nyou so frequently brutalize it.”\n“Ain’t nobody what knows the cow better than the butcher, Wax.”\n“I suppose…” Wax said, standing up. “Have you ever met a woman\nnamed Idashwy? A Feruchemist.”\n“Steelrunner?”\nWax nodded.\n“Never met her,” Wayne said. “They keep kicking me out of the Village\nwhen I visit. Right unneighborly.”\nSo far as Wax knew, that wasn’t true. Wayne would occasionally toss on\nsome Terris robes, mimic their accents, then sneak in to live among them\nfor a few days. He’d eventually get into trouble for saying something crude\nto one of the young women, but he wouldn’t get thrown out. He’d baffle\nthem, as he did most people, until he got bored and wandered away.\n“Let’s see what we can find,” Wax said, waving down a canal gondola.\n* * *\n“Five notes, for one basket of apples! That’s robbery!”\nMarasi hesitated on the street. She’d driven the motorcar up to the Hub\nfor the governor’s speech, then parked it with the coachmen who took pay\nto watch and refuel motors, intending to walk the rest of the way on foot.\nThe Hub could be a busy place.\nThat led her here, near this small street market with people selling fruit.\nWith disbelief, she saw that one vendor was—indeed—selling apples at five\nnotes a basket. Those shouldn’t cost more than half a boxing per basket, at\nmost. She’d seen them for a handful of clips.\n“I could get these at Elend’s stand for a fraction of the price!” the\ncustomer said.\n“Well, why don’t you go see if he has any left?” the cart owner said,\nnonplussed.

The customer stormed off, leaving the cart owner with her sign\nproudly proclaiming the ridiculous price. Marasi frowned, then glanced\ndown the row of stands, barrels, and carts.\nSuspiciously low quantities, all ’round. She walked up to the cart owner\nwith the high prices; the woman stood up stiffly, braids shaking, and shoved\nher hands into the pockets of her apron. “Officer,” she said.\n“Five is on the high side, wouldn’t you say?” Marasi asked, picking up\nan apple. “Unless these are infused with atium.”\n“Am I doing anything wrong?” the woman asked.\n“You have the right to set your prices,” Marasi said. “One simply\nwonders what you seem to know that nobody else does.”\nThe woman didn’t respond.\n“Shipment coming late?” Marasi asked. “Apple harvest gone bad?”\nThe woman sighed. “Not apples, officer. Grain shipments out of the\neast. Simply not coming. Floods did them in.”\n“A little early to be speculating on food prices, don’t you think?”\n“Pardon, officer, but do you know how much food this city eats? We’re\none shipment away from starvation, we are.”\nMarasi glanced down the row again. Food was moving quickly, most of\nit—from what she could see—being sold to the same group of people.\nSpeculators grabbing up the fruits and sacks of grain. The city wasn’t as\nclose to starvation as the cart owner claimed—there were storages that\ncould be released—but bad news moved faster than calm winds. And there\nwas a good chance this woman was right, that she’d be able to sell her\napples at a premium until things calmed down in a few days.\nMarasi shook her head, setting down the apple and continuing toward\nthe Hub. There was always a press here, people on the promenade, vehicles\non the streets trying to force their way into the ring around the Hub. More\npeople today, crowds drawn by the speech causing traffic clots in the\nregular bustle. Marasi could barely make out the giant statues of the\nAscendant Warrior and her husband in the Field of Rebirth peeking out over\nthe throng.\nMarasi walked up to join another group of constables who had just\narrived, on Aradel’s orders, their carriages lagging behind her motorcar.\nTogether they wended their way through the streets on foot toward the\nexecutive mansion. The governor preferred to address people from its steps,\na few streets up into the Second Octant from the Hub.\nThey soon reached the large square before the mansion. Moving here\nwas more difficult, but fortunately the constables from this octant were\nalready in attendance—and they had roped off various areas near the front\nand sides of the square. In one, dignitaries and noblemen sat on bleachers to\nhear the address. In another, the Second Octant constables clustered and\nwatched the crowd for pickpockets from the steps up into the National\nArchives.

A mustachioed older constable was\ndirecting things here, his helm—under his arm—bearing the double plume\nof a captain. When he saw Marasi, Javies, and the team, the man lit up.\n“Ah, so Aradel sent me reinforcements after all,” he exclaimed.\n“Rusting wonderful. You chaps go watch the east side of the square, down\nLongard Street. Foundry workers are gathering there, and they don’t look\ntoo pleasant. This isn’t the place for their picket lines, I dare say. Maybe an\neyeful of constable uniforms will keep them in check.”\n“Sir,” Javies said, saluting. “Those masses are pushing up against the\nsteps to the mansion! With respect, sir, don’t you want us up there?”\n“Governor’s guards have jurisdiction, Lieutenant,” the old captain said.\n“They brush us back if we try to do anything on the actual mansion\ngrounds. Damn pewternecked bulls. They barely give us warning anytime\nthe governor wants to have a say to the people, then expect us to do the hard\nwork of policing this mess.”\nJavies saluted, and his team ran off.\n“Sir,” Marasi said, remaining behind. “Constable-General Aradel\nwanted me to bring him a direct report on the speech. Do you think I could\nget a spot on those bleachers to watch?”\n“No luck there,” the captain said. “Every niece and nanny of a house\nlord has demanded a spot; they’ll gut me if I send someone else over.”\n“Thank you anyway, sir. I’ll see if I can work my way to the front of the\ncrowd.” Marasi moved off.\n“Wait, constable,” the old man said. “Don’t I know you?”\nShe looked back, blushing. “I’m—”\n“Lord Harms’s girl!” the old captain said. “The bastard. That’s it! Now,\ndon’t get red-faced. That’s not meant as an insult, child. Just what you are,\nand that’s it, simple as day. I like your father. He was bad enough at cards to\nbe fun to play against, but he was careful not to bet so much that I felt bad\nwinning.”\n“Sir.” News of her nature, once kept discreet, had moved through all of\nhigh society. Hanging around Waxillium, who created such stirs, did have\nits drawbacks. And her mother did have something of a reason for her angry\nletters.\nMarasi was quite accepting of what she was. That didn’t mean she liked\nhaving it thrown at her. Old nobleman officers like this, though … well,\nthey came from a time when they felt they could say whatever they wanted,\nparticularly about their subordinates.\n“There’s space with the reporters, Little Harms,” he said, pointing. “Up\nnear the north side. Not great for watching, as you’ll have steps in your\nway, but a great place for listening.

Among the constables at least, couldn’t\nshe be known for her professional accomplishments, not the nature of her\nbirth?\nStill, she wouldn’t turn down the opportunity for a better spot, so she\nbegan to work her way around the square toward the section he’d specified.\n* * *\nWhat was that? Wax thought. He spun to look away from the group of\nbeggars he’d been questioning.\n“Wax?” Wayne called, turning away from another group of people.\n“What—”\nWax ignored him, shoving through a crowd on the street toward the\nthing he’d seen. A face.\nIt can’t be.\nHis frantic actions drew annoyed shouts from some people, but only\ndark glares from others. The days when a nobleman, even an Allomancer,\ncould quell with a look were passing. Wax eventually stumbled into a\npocket of open ground and spun about. Where? Wild, every sense straining,\nhe dropped a bullet casing and Pushed, instantly popping up about ten feet.\nScanning, he whirled, the motion flaring his mistcoat tassels.\nThe heavy flow of people on Tindwyl Promenade continued toward the\nHub, near which the governor would apparently be making a speech. That’s\na dangerous crowd, a piece of him noticed. There were too many men\nwearing battered coats and bearing battered expressions. The labor issue\nwas becoming a bigger and bigger problem. Half the city was underpaid\nand overworked. The other half was simply out of work. A strange\ndichotomy.\nHe kept seeing men loitering on corners. Now they flowed together in\nstreams. That would create dangerous rapids, as when a real river met\nrocks. Wax landed, heart thrumming like the drum of a march. He’d been\nsure of it, this time. He had seen Bloody Tan in that crowd of men. A brief\nglimpse of a familiar face, the mortician killer, the last man Wax had hunted\nin the Roughs before coming to Elendel.\nThe man who had caused Lessie’s death.\n“Wax?” Wayne hurried up. “Wax, you all right? You look like you ate an\negg you found in the gutter.”\n“It’s nothing,” Wax said.\n“Ah,” Wayne said. “Then that look I saw … you were just contemplatin’\nyour impendin’ marriage to Steris, I guess?”\nWax sighed, turning away from the crowds. I imagined it. I must have\nimagined it. “I wish you’d leave Steris alone. She’s not nearly so bad as you\nmake her sound.”\n“That’s the same thing you said about that horse you bought—you\nremember, the one who only bit me?”\n“Roseweather had good taste.

She hasn’t come in to work in\nover a week though. The jeweler sent someone to her flat, but nobody\nanswered the door.”\n“You got the address?” Wax asked.\n“Of course I did.” Wayne looked offended, shoving his hands in the\npockets of his duster. “Got me a new pocket watch too.” He held up one\nmade of pure gold, with opaline workings on the face.\nWax sighed. After a short trip back to the jeweler to return the watch—\nWayne claimed he figured it had been for trade, since it had been sitting out\non the counter with naught but a little box of glass around it—they made\ntheir way up the road to the Bournton District.\nThis was a high-quality neighborhood, which also meant it had less\ncharacter. No laundry airing in front of buildings, no people sitting on the\nsteps. Instead the street was lined by white townhouses and rows of\napartment buildings with spiky iron decorations around their upper\nwindows. They checked the address with one of the local newsboys, and\neventually found themselves in front of the apartment building in question.\n“Someday I’d like to live in a fancy place like this,” Wayne said\nwistfully.\n“Wayne, you live in a mansion.”\n“It ain’t fancy. It’s opulent. Big difference.”\n“Which is?”\n“Mostly it involves which kinds of glasses you drink out of and what\nkind of art you hang.” Wayne looked offended. “You need to know these\nthings now, Wax, being filthy rich and all.”\n“Wayne, you’re practically rich yourself, after the reward from the\nVanishers case.”\nWayne shrugged. He hadn’t touched his share of that, which had been\npaid out mostly in aluminum recovered from Miles and his gang. Wax led\nthe way up the steps running along the outside of the building. Idashwy’s\nplace was at the top, a small apartment on the rear, with a view only of the\nback of other buildings. Wax slipped Vindication out of her holster, then\nknocked, standing to the side of the door in case someone shot through it.\nNo response.\n“Nice door,” Wayne said softly. “Good wood.” He kicked it open.\nWax leveled his gun and Wayne ducked inside, sliding up against the\nwall to avoid being backlit. He found a switch a moment later, turning on\nthe room’s electric lights.\nWax raised the gun beside his head, pointing at the ceiling, and swept in.\nThe apartment wasn’t much to look at. The pile of folded blankets in the\ncorner probably served as a bed. With steelsight, Wax saw no moving bits\nof metal. Everything was still and calm.\nWax peeked into the bathroom while Wayne moved over to the only\nother room in the apartment, a kitchen. Indoor plumbing for the bathroom,\nelectric lights. This was a fancy place. Most Terris claimed to prefer simple\nlives. What had led her to pay for something like this?\n“Aw, hell,” Wayne said from the kitchen. “That ain’t no fun.”"

What had led her to pay for something like this?\n“Aw, hell,” Wayne said from the kitchen. “That ain’t no fun.”\nWax moved over, gun out, and glanced around the corner into the\nkitchen. It was just large enough for one person to lie down in. He knew\nthis because of the bloody corpse stretched out on the floor, her chest\nbearing a large hole in the center, eyes staring sightlessly into the air.\n“Looks like we’re going to need a new prime suspect, Wax,” Wayne\nsaid. “This one downright refuses to not be dead already.”\n* * *\nMarasi’s position at the speech turned out to be exactly as advertised:\nnestled into a narrow gap in the crowd formed by the side steps of the\nmansion’s forecourt. Around her, the members of the press clutched pencils\nand pads, ready to jot down bite-sized quotes from the governor’s speech\nthat might make good headlines. Marasi was the only constable among\nthem, and her lieutenant’s bars didn’t earn her much consideration from the\nreporters.\nTheir view was obstructed not only by the position of the wide stone\nsteps, but also by the governor’s guard—a row of men and women in dark\nsuits and hats, standing with hands clasped behind their backs along the\nsteps. Only a pair of sketch artists, who stood at one corner of the knot of\nreporters, had anything resembling a good view of the governor’s platform,\nwhich had been erected on the steps.\nThat was fine with Marasi. She didn’t need to see much of Innate to\ndigest and relate his words. Besides, this position gave her an excellent\nview of the gathering crowd, which she found more interesting. Dirty men\nstained with soot from work in the factories. Tired women who—because of\nthe advent of electricity—could now be forced to work much longer hours,\nwell into the night, with the threat of dismissal to keep them at the loom.\nYet there was hope in those eyes. Hope that the governor would have\nencouragement to offer, a promised end to the city’s growing strain.\nMirabell’s Rules, Marasi thought, nodding to herself. Mirabell had been\na statistician and psychologist in the third century who had studied why\nsome people worked harder than others. Turned out a man or woman was\nmuch more likely to do good work if they were invested—if they felt\nownership of what they did and could see that it mattered. Her personal\nstudies proved that crime went down when people had a sense of identity\nwith and ownership of their community.\nThat was the problem, because modern society was eroding those\nconcepts. Life seemed more transient now, with people commonly\nrelocating and changing jobs during their lifetime—things that had almost\nnever happened a century ago. Progress had forced it upon them. These\ndays, Elendel just didn’t need as many carriage drivers as it did automobile\nrepairmen.\nYou had to adapt. Move. Change. That was good, but it could also\nthreaten identity, connection, and sense of purpose. The governor’s guards\nstudied the crowd with hostility, muttering about miscreants, as if seeing the\ncrowd as barely contained malefactors who were looking for any excuse to\nriot and loot.\nTo the contrary, these people wanted something stable, something that"

Rioting was\nrarely caused by greed, but frequently by frustration and hopelessness.\nThe governor finally made his appearance, stepping from the mansion.\nMarasi caught a few fragmentary glimpses of him between the legs of the\nguards. Innate was a tall, handsome man, unlike his brother, who had\nalways seemed dumpy to Marasi. Clean-shaven, with a wave in his salt-\nand-pepper hair and a trendy set of spectacles, Innate was the first governor\nto pose for his official portrait wearing spectacles.\nWould he know? Would he understand how to calm these people? He\nwas corrupt, but it was a quiet kind of corruption—little favors done to\nenrich himself or his friends. It was quite possible he did care for the people\nof his city, even while enriching himself. He stepped up to his platform,\nwhere a diminutive woman in a green dress skittered around, adjusting\ndevices that looked like big cones with their wide openings facing the\ncrowd. Marasi felt she should recognize the young woman—who was\nbarely more than a girl, with long blonde hair and a lean face. Where had\nMarasi seen her before?\nShe thought for a moment, then sidled up to one of the reporters to read\nover her shoulder. “Breezy day” … blah blah … “air of violent suspense,”\nwhatever that means … There! “Attended by the curious ministrations of\nMiss Sophi Tarcsel, the inventor’s daughter.”\nSophi Tarcsel. She’d been making an uproar, writing opinion pieces in\nthe broadsheets about her father, who had supposedly been a great inventor\n—though Marasi had never heard or read his name before those articles.\n“People of Elendel,” Governor Innate said, and Marasi was surprised by\nhow his voice echoed across the square, loud and clear. Something to do\nwith those devices, apparently. “The papers would have you believe that\nthis evening we stand on the brink of a crisis, but I assure you, no such\nproblem exists. My brother was not the criminal they are condemning him\nto have been.”\nOh, Innate, Marasi thought, sighing to herself as she wrote. That’s not\nwhy they’re here. Nobody had come to hear more about Winsting. What\nabout the city’s real problems?\n“I will not suffer this defamation of my dear brother’s character,” Innate\ncontinued. “He was a good man, a statesman and philanthropist. You might\nhave forgotten the Hub beautification project that he spearheaded just three\nyears ago, but I have not.…”\nHe continued in that vein. Marasi dutifully took notes for Captain\nAradel, but she shook her head. Innate’s goal was understandable. He hoped\nto preserve his family’s reputation in the eyes of important investors and\nnoblemen, and perhaps deflate some of the public anger. It wouldn’t work.\nThe people didn’t actually care about Winsting. It was the deeper\ncorruption, the feeling of powerlessness, that was destroying this city.\nAs the speech progressed, laboring with explanations of how good a\nman Winsting had been, Marasi edged to the side in an attempt to get a"

How was Innate responding to the crowd? He was charismatic;\nshe could hear that even from the way he spoke. Maybe he was doing some\ngood with his oratory alone, even if the speech lacked substance.\n“A full investigation of the constables will be ordered,” Innate\ncontinued. “I am not convinced my brother was killed as they say. My\nsources posit this might all be the result of a bungled raid, using my brother\nas willing bait to catch criminals. If that is true, and they put my brother in\nharm’s way and are now covering it up, the responsible parties will answer\nfor it.”\nMarasi moved to the side, but her view was obstructed by one of the\nguards, who stepped in front of her. Annoyed, Marasi moved again, and\nagain the guardsman moved. She’d have considered it deliberate if his back\nhadn’t been to her.\n“As for the floods in the east, we are sending relief. Your friends and\nrelatives there shall be succored. We stand with them in the face of this\ndisaster.”\nNot good, she noted. The people don’t want to hear about aid going\noutside the city, no matter how necessary, not while things are growing\nworse and worse here.… Marasi moved again. Aradel wanted her to judge\nthe public’s reaction, but she needed a better view.\nHer shuffling earned a curse of annoyance from one of the reporters, and\nshe finally got a sight of Innate on his podium. He moved into a longer rant\nagainst the press. Perhaps that was why the reporter had been so testy. She\ncertainly would be.…\nMarasi frowned. That guardsman who had been moving and shuffling\nand blocking her view had turned, and she could see a very odd expression\non his face, like a grimace of pain. And he was whispering—at least his\nmouth was moving. Nobody else seemed to notice him, as they were\nfocused on the speech.\nSo Marasi was the first one to scream as the guardsman pulled a\nrevolver from underneath his coat and leveled it at the governor.\n* * *\nWayne prowled around the dead woman’s room. It was too clean. A room\nwhere people lived should have a healthy amount of clutter. Miss\nSteelrunner hadn’t spent much time here.\nIn the other room, Wax inspected the body. Wayne left him to that; he\nhad no interest in poking at a corpse’s insides, even if Wax claimed it was\nimportant. Wayne, instead, went looking for more interesting bits of life.\nHis first discovery was a small cache of bottles in the cabinet under the\nbathroom washbasin. Various forms of alcohol, the harder stuff, each a little\ngone. All save one, which was empty. Wayne gave it a sniff. Port.\nNot surprising, he thought. He took the whiskey and gave it a good\nswig. Bleh. Too much bite, and far too warm. He took another swig as he\nspun about in the main room. These fancy neighborhoods were too quiet.\nPeople should be shouting outside.

He checked\nthe trunk beside her sleeping pallet and found it contained three outfits, each\nclean and carefully folded. The Terris robes were on the bottom. Creases\nhad set; these weren’t worn often. The other two were modern designs, the\none on top more daring than the one below.\nHe took another swig of whiskey and wandered back into the room with\nthe corpse. Wax had removed his hat and coat, and knelt beside the body in\nhis vest and slacks.\n“You found the alcohol, I see,” Wax said. “How uncharacteristic.”\nWayne grinned, offering the bottle to Wax, who took a small swig.\n“Ugh,” he noted, handing it back. “This murder is troubling, Wayne.”\n“I’m sure she felt so.”\n“Too many questions. Why did she leave the Village, and why choose to\nlive here? It doesn’t feel very Terris.”\n“Oh, I can tell you why she was here,” Wayne said.\n“Well?”\n“Think of yourself as a sheltered Terriswoman in her forties,” Wayne\nsaid. “Old enough to have missed the chance to be a wild youth, and\nstarting to wish you’d done something more daring.”\n“The Terris don’t long for wildness,” Wax said, taking notes in a little\nbook as he inspected the woman’s wound. “They aren’t daring. They’re a\nreserved people.”\n“Ain’t we Terris?”\n“We’re exceptions.”\n“Everyone’s an exception to something, Wax. This girl, she left the\nVillage and found a whole world out here. She must have had an\nadventurous side.”\nWhiskey.\n“She did,” Wax admitted. “I didn’t know her well, but she’d sneak out\nof the Village as a youth. That was long ago.”\n“And she left again,” Wayne said, “on account of the Village being so\ndull as to bore the sense out of a scribe. Hell, even Steris would hate that\nplace.”\n“Wayne…”\n“Our miss,” Wayne said, waving the bottle toward the dead woman,\n“she tried to remain conservative at first, so she got a job as a clerk, a good\nTerris occupation. She convinced herself that a nice apartment—where she\nwas safe from the supposed horrors of lesser neighborhoods—was worth\nthe expense. Simple stuff.\n“But then some workers at the jeweler took her out, and she let herself\ndrink. She liked that. Awakened memories of sneaked drinks as a youth.\nShe wanted more, so she bought a whole mess of different kinds of spirits to\ntry them all out. She liked port best, by the way.”\n“Makes sense,” Wax said.\n“Now we find her with increasingly liberal dresses, showing more skin,\nspending most evenings out. Give her a few more months, and she’d have\nturned into a right proper girl to have a good time with.”\nWhiskey.\n“She didn’t get a few more months,” Wax said softly. He took\nsomething from his own pocket and handed it out to Wayne.

Polite\napplause from the nobility, shouts and curses from most of the workers. The\nnoise swallowed her shout like a single splash in a breaking tide.\nShe fumbled for her handbag as the guard in the dark coat sighted with\nhis gun at the governor. No. There wasn’t time for her gun. She had to do\nsomething else.\nShe jumped for the man and slowed time.\nShe had metal in her this time—she’d made sure, after being\nembarrassed this morning. Her Allomancy created a bubble of greatly\nslowed-down time, enveloping herself, the would-be assassin, and a few\nbystanders.\nShe grabbed the man around the legs, but her speed bubble did the real\nwork, trapping him inside—as everyone outside became a blur. The man\nsqueezed his gun’s trigger, and the crack of a gunshot rang amid the strange\nwarping of sounds that she heard inside a bubble from those outside. One of\nhis fellow guards, also caught in her bubble, shouted in alarm.\nThe fired bullet hit the perimeter of the speed bubble and was deflected.\nIt shot out over the blur of the crowd, the governor’s figure vanishing as—\nshe assumed—he was rushed away. Marasi’s lunge wasn’t enough to topple\nthe would-be assassin, and so she lay there half on the steps, holding on to\nhis legs and feeling foolish, until one of his companions hit him harder,\nknocking him down.\nShe dropped the speed bubble and jumped back, the sudden roar of the\ncrowd washing over her. The captured man struggled, shouting, as other\nguards piled onto him.\n* * *\n“So basically, with this … Hemalurgy,” Wax said, “you can make someone\nMetalborn.”\nWayne sniffled as he flipped through the book, and his cheeks were\nbreaking out in some kind of rash. Storing health, Wax thought. Wayne\noften ended up with odd rashes when he did that. They sat in the main room\nof Idashwy’s apartment, away from the corpse, which they’d draped with a\nsheet. They’d paused briefly in their inspection to send the newsboy for the\nlocal constables.\nWax ground his teeth. Idashwy’s wound … it was just like those\ndescribed in the book. Somebody had killed this woman with a spike\nthrough the chest, stealing her Feruchemical talent. The book described the\nprocess as “tearing off a chunk of someone’s soul.” Using the spike, one\ncould effectively attach that piece of soul to one’s own, granting the powers\nof the deceased.\nIn the old days, Inquisitors had driven the spike right through the body\nof the one to be killed into the body of the person to gain the powers. That\nprevented any power from being lost. Apparently, coating the newly made\nspike in blood could achieve a similar effect.\nHe knew, Wax thought.

Lestibournes’s book said he\nconsidered it a crime that the Words of Founding—Harmony’s own record\n—omitted references to the dark art.\n“So our killer knows this Hemalurgy stuff?” Wayne said.\n“Yes,” Wax said. “The killer used a spike to steal Idashwy’s\nFeruchemical talent, then employed that ability to kill Lord Winsting and\nhis guests. We have to assume that our killer could also have numerous\nother powers at their disposal: any combination of Allomantic or\nFeruchemical abilities. Or all of them.”\nWayne whistled softly.\n“Did you discover anything else in your search of the room?” Wax\nasked.\n“Not much.”\n“I understand the motive here,” Wax said, glancing back toward the\nkitchen with the body. “But I don’t yet have one for Winsting’s murder.\nOr … well, I know of too many possibilities. I don’t have the right motive.”\n“What did you find in the stiff’s pockets?”\nWax hesitated.\n“You didn’t rifle through the pockets?” Wayne asked, aghast. “Wax,\nyou’re a terrible grave robber!”\n“I was distracted by the manner of death,” Wax said, rising. “I’d have\ngotten to it.”\nThe word “distracted” didn’t really do justice to his emotions—to the\nprofound shock, the numbness. For months that book had been only an\nobject of study, but now its contents had abruptly ceased being mere words\non a page and had become a motive for murder.\nWe’re out of our depth, Wax thought, returning to the kitchen. We’ve\ncrept into the realm of the gods. Harmony, Ironeyes, the Lord Mistborn …\nWayne pulled back the sheet, exposing that gaping hole in the woman’s\nchest—right at the sternum. Who would know how to do something like\nthis? Who would Harmony let know how to do something like this?\n“Here,” Wayne said, fishing in the woman’s skirt pockets. He came out\nwith a folded-up piece of paper. He unfolded it, then grunted. “Huh. It’s for\nyou.”\nWax’s stomach plummeted. Wayne slowly turned the paper around. It\nwas a sheet ripped from a ledger, filled with numbers and sums. Scrawled\nacross it in a different hand was a single sentence—a familiar sentence. The\nvery words Bloody Tan had said before jerking Lessie right into the path of\nWax’s bullet, making him kill the woman he loved.\nSomeone else moves us, lawman.\n7\n“Look, Wax,” Wayne said as the two of them entered Ladrian Mansion, “I\nsaw Tan’s body. You shot him square in the head. That bloke was deader\nthan a stuffed lion in a hunting lodge. It ain’t him.”\n“What if he was secretly Metalborn?” Wax asked. “Miles could have\nsurvived a shot to the head.”\n“Doesn’t work that way, mate,” Wayne said, shutting the door and\ntossing his coat at Darriance.

He needed time to think—\npreferably with his earring in—and to go through Ranette’s package. They\nwere always very interesting.\nBut he couldn’t simply ignore Steris. “Thank you, Darriance,” Wax said.\n“Send a note to my grandmother at the Village that says we found the\nmissing Terriswoman, but someone had gotten to her—and regretfully\nkilled her—before we arrived.

If you catch the murderer of the governor’s\nbrother, it will be politically favorable.”\n“Unless I drag some corpses out into the light.”\n“Well, perhaps we can prepare for that,” she said. “Lady ZoBell’s party.\nYou are still planning to attend with me?”\nRusts.

More dances and\npolitical games. He needed to be working, hunting.\nBloody Tan. His eye twitched.\n“There was some talk of the governor not attending,” Steris said,\n“considering what happened today. However, I have it on the best authority\nthat he will come.

They were created by the Lord Ruler using\nHemalurgy.\n“Your Holy Books give few details about their organization,” Wax said.\n“But everyone knows that the Faceless Immortals are your servants.

Paalm was what we\ncalled her, but she has chosen the name Bleeder for herself. Waxillium,\nBleeder is ancient, older than the destruction of the world—almost as old as\nthe Final Empire. Indeed, she is even older than I am, though not older than\nmy powers. She is crafty, careful, and brilliant. And I’m afraid that she\nmight have gone mad.\nThe carriage turned a corner.\n“One of Your ancient servants,” Wax said, “has gone mad and is killing\npeople.”\nYes.\n“So stop her!”\nIt is not so simple.\n“Free will?” Wax said, annoyed.\nNo, not in this case. I can directly control a being who has pierced\nherself with too much Hemalurgy. In this case I would act, for Bleeder has\ndisobeyed her Contract with me and opened herself up for my intervention.\nSomething is wrong, unfortunately.\n“What?” Wax asked.\nGod was silent for a time. I don’t know yet.\nWax felt cold. “Is that possible?”\nIt appears so. Somehow, Bleeder has figured out how to hide from me.\nAt times I can spot her, but only when she takes direct and obvious action.\nUnfortunately, she has removed one of her Blessings—one of the two\nspikes that kandra must keep inside themselves to retain their cognition. I\nwould forcibly control her if I could, but one spike does not pierce the soul\nsufficiently for me to get in.\n“Cognition,” Wax said. “Two spikes are required for the kandra to be\nable to think. But she is going around with only one. Which means…?”\nInsanity, Harmony said, His voice softer in Wax’s ear. But something is\nwrong beyond that. She can hide from me, and while I can speak to her, she\ndoesn’t have to listen—and I can’t keep track of where she is.\n“Didn’t you say you were everywhere?”\nMy essence is, Harmony said. But this thing that I am … it is more\ncomplex than you might expect.\n“Being God is more complex than a mortal can comprehend?” Wax\nsaid. “What a surprise.”\nHarmony chuckled softly.\nWait, Wax thought. Did I just get sarcastic with God Himself?\nYes, you did, Harmony said. It is well. Few act that way toward me, even\namong the kandra. It feels good to me. Like older times. Since Kelsier …\nwell, I haven’t had much of that.\n“You can hear my thoughts?” Wax asked.\nWhen you have the earring in, yes. I gain the ability to hear you from\nPreservation, and the ability to speak to you from Ruin. Each had only one\nhalf. I always found it puzzling.\nRegardless, I know you have been reading young Lestibournes’s book. I\nam not pleased that he made it, but I could not forbid him. I will trust that\nMarsh was wise in giving it to you. Bleeder can use Hemalurgy, but in a\nway she should not be able to. Kandra do not have Allomantic or\nFeruchemical powers.

She has learned to take these, and to use them to\nmaintain her kandra form.\nFortunately, she is limited. She can only use one spike at a time,\notherwise she will open herself to my control. If she trades spikes, she must\ndo it by ripping out her single one and then falling onto another, digesting it\nand returning her to sapience.\nI do not know her game with this city, but I’m alarmed by it. She has\nspent centuries studying human behavior. She is planning something.\n“I’ll have to stop her, then.”\nI will send you help.\n“I assume, considering the source, it will be spectacular.”\nHarmony sighed softly. In Wax’s mind’s eye, he had a sudden image of\na being standing with hands clasped behind Him, eternity extending into\ndarkness before Him. Tall, robed, back to Wax, almost visible and distinct\nyet somehow completely unknowable at the same time.\nWaxillium, Harmony said, I have tried to explain this to you, but I did\nnot do a good job, I think. My hands are tied, and I am bounded.\n“Who ties God’s hands?”\nI tied them myself.\nWax frowned.\nI hold both Ruin and Preservation, Harmony said. The danger in\ncarrying these opposed powers is that I can see both sides—the need for\nlife, the need for death. I am balance. And, to an extent, I am neutrality.\n“But Bleeder used to be one of Your own, and now she’s acting against\nYou.”\nShe used to be of Preservation. She has moved to being of Ruin. Both\nare needed.\n“Murderers are needed,” Wax said flatly.\nYes. No. The potential for murderers is needed. Waxillium, I—the\npersonality you speak to—agree with your indignation. But the powers that\nI am, the essence of my self, cannot allow me to take sides.\nAlready I fear that I have made things too easy for men. This city, the\nperfect climate, the ground that renews … You were to have had the radio a\ncentury ago, but you didn’t need it, so you didn’t strive for it. You ignore\naviation, and cannot tame the wilds because you don’t care to study proper\nirrigation or fertilization.\n“The … radio? What is that?”\nYou don’t explore, Harmony continued, ignoring Wax’s confusion. Why\nwould you? You have everything you want here. You’ve barely progressed\ntechnologically from what I gave you in the books. Yet others, who were\nnearly destroyed …\nI made a mistake with you, I now see. I still make many. Does that ruin\nyour faith, Waxillium? Does it worry you that your God is fallible?\n“You never claimed to be infallible, so far as I remember.”\nNo. I did not.\nWax felt a warmth, a fire, as if the inside of the carriage were heating to\nincredible temperatures.\nI loathe suffering, Waxillium. I hate that people like Bleeder must be\nallowed to do what they do. I cannot stop them. You can. I beg you to do so.\n“I will try.”\nGood. Oh, and Waxillium?\n“Yes, Lord?”"

It is taxing to have you continue to\ndismiss her because her admiration makes you uncomfortable.\nWax swallowed. “Yes, Lord.”\nI will send you help.\nThe voice vanished. The temperature returned to normal. Wax leaned\nback, sweating, feeling drained.\nA rapping came at his window. Hesitant, Wax pulled aside the shade.\nWayne’s face hung there, upside down, his hand holding his hat onto his\nhead. “You done talking to yourself, Wax?” he asked.\n“I … Yes, I am.”\n“I heard voices in my head once too, you know.”\n“You did?”\n“Sure. Gave me a fright. I banged my head against the wall until I went\nunconscious. Never heard them again! Ha. Showed ’em good, I did. If rats\nmove in, best thing to do is to burn the nest and send ’em packing.”\n“And the nest … was your head.”\n“Yup.”\nThe sad thing was, Wayne probably wasn’t lying. Being unkillable, so\nlong as one had some healing power stored up, could do strange things to a\nperson’s sense of self-preservation. Of course, Wayne had probably been\ndrunk at the time. That also tended to do strange things to a person’s sense\nof self-preservation.\n“Well, anyway,” Wayne said. “We’re almost to the precinct\nheadquarters. Time to go back to being dirty conners. At least they’ll\nprobably have scones inside.”\n* * *\nMarasi stood in the precinct station with arms folded, partially to hide the\nfact that her hands were still trembling. That was unfair. She’d been in\nfirefights numerous times now. She should be accustomed to this … but\nstill, after the jolt of it all wore off—the moment of thrill and action—she\noccasionally found herself feeling drained. Surely she’d get past it\neventually.\n“He was wearing these, sir,” Reddi said, placing a pair of bracers onto\nthe table with a thump. “No other metal on his body save for the gun and a\npocketful of rounds. We’ve called in the First Octant precinct’s Leecher to\nmake sure he doesn’t have any metal swallowed, but we can’t be certain\nuntil she arrives.”\nAradel picked up one of the bracers, turning it over in his hands. The\ndim room was a kind of balcony, overlooking the interrogation chamber\nbelow, where the assassin Marasi had stopped sat slumped in a chair. His\nname was Rian; no house, though they’d located his family. He was tied\nwith ropes to a large stone behind his chair. No metal in the room, to make\nit safe to stow Coinshots or Lurchers. Stone floor, walls made of thick wood\njoined with wooden pegs. Almost primitive in feel.

The balcony had glass\nwalls, letting them look down upon him without being heard.\n“So he’s Metalborn,” said Lieutenant Caberel, the only other person in\nthe room. The stout woman picked up the other bracer. “Why didn’t he use\nhis abilities in the assassination? If he killed Winsting with Feruchemical\nspeed, like old Waxillium Dawnshot says, he should have done the same\ntoday.”\n“Maybe he didn’t kill Winsting,” Aradel said. “The attacks could be\nunrelated.”\n“He fits the profile though, sir,” Reddi said. “Winsting’s bodyguards\nprobably would have trusted a member of the governor’s personal guard.\nHe could have talked his way past them and done the deed.”\n“Hard to imagine Winsting’s guards letting even someone like that in\nalone with their charge, Captain,” Aradel said. “After a firefight where\nothers were being killed? They’d be tense. Suspicious.”\nDown below, the suspect began rocking back and forth on his seat. The\nvents that would allow them to listen in on him were closed, but she had a\nsense that he was muttering to himself again.\n“So, we just ask him,” Caberel said.\n“Again?” Reddi said. “You heard before. All he does is mumble.”\n“Then encourage him,” Caberel said. “You’re pretty good at that,\nReddi.”\n“I suppose his face could use a few new bruises,” Reddi said.\n“You know you can’t do that,” Marasi said from beside the window.\nReddi looked at her. “Don’t quote statistics at me, Colms. I’ve found I\ncan make a man speak the truth, no matter what you claim.”\n“It isn’t statistics this time,” Marasi said. “If you actively torture that\nman, you’ll ruin him for prosecution. His attorneys will get him off for\nsure.”\nReddi gave her a scowl.\n“So send for his daughter,” Caberel said, glancing over the fact sheet\nthey had on the man. “We threaten her in front of him, but don’t do\nanything to harm her. He’ll talk.”\nMarasi rubbed her forehead. “That’s specifically illegal, Caberel. Do\nyou people know nothing about Article Eighty-Nine? He has rights.”\n“He’s a criminal,” Reddi said.\n“He’s a suspected criminal.” Marasi sighed. “You can’t continue to act\nas you have in the past, Reddi. New laws are in place. They’re only going to\nget stricter, and the defense attorneys are increasingly clever.”\n“The solicitors have sold out to the other side,” Caberel said with a nod.\n“She’s right.”\nMarasi remained silent on that score. Of course it wasn’t really a matter\nof selling out at all—but she’d settle for the constables learning to follow\nthe rules, regardless of the reasoning.\n“I think,” Reddi said, “that it’s unfortunate we’ve got someone among\nus who seems to be more on the solicitors’ side than on the side of justice.\nShe knows more about their ways than ours.”\n“Perhaps she does,” Aradel said in a soft, stern voice. “And one might\nconsider that to be exactly why I brought her in among us, Captain Reddi."

If you paid more attention to the\nvery laws you are sworn to uphold, perhaps Daughnin wouldn’t have gotten\nback on the street last month.”\nReddi blushed, bowing his head. Aradel stepped up beside Marasi,\nlooking down at the captive. “How are you at interrogating hostile\nwitnesses, Lieutenant?”\n“Less practiced than I’d like to be,” she replied with a grimace. “I’m\nwilling to give it a try, but we might as well wait for a few more minutes.”\n“Why?”\nDistantly, a door slammed. “That’s why,” Marasi said.\nA moment later, the door into their observation chamber was flung open,\nPushed by Waxillium as he approached. Couldn’t the man be bothered to\nlift a hand from time to time? He strode in, tailed by Wayne, who was for\nsome reason wearing Constable Terri’s hat.\nWaxillium looked down at the captive. He narrowed his eyes, then\nglanced at the bracers on the table nearby. One jumped, then fell off the\ntable, Pushed by his unseen Allomantic ability.\nHe grunted. “Those aren’t metalminds,” he said. “This man is a decoy.\nYou’ve been duped.” He turned as if to leave. Wayne slouched down in one\nof the chairs and put his feet up beside the bracers, then promptly started\nsnoring.\n“Wait, that’s it?” Reddi said, glancing at Waxillium. “You aren’t even\ngoing to interrogate him?”\n“I’ll talk to him,” Waxillium said. “He might give us clues that will help\nfind Winsting’s killer. But it wasn’t that man.”\n“How can you be so sure, Waxillium?” Marasi said.\n“It takes more effort to Push on real metalminds,” Waxillium said,\npointing. “And that man is too obvious. Whoever did this has predicted our\nconjecture that one of Innate’s guards was behind the murder, and wants us\nto jump on this man as a suspect. They want us to assume we have the killer\nin custody. Why, though? Are they planning something tonight…?”\nDistracted, he walked toward the door. “I’m going to go talk to the prisoner.\nMarasi, I wouldn’t mind another set of ears.”\nShe started. He was asking her for help? That was a change from\nmaking her feel guilty every time she showed up at a crime scene. She\nglanced at Aradel, who gave her leave, and she hurried after Waxillium.\nIn the stairwell down, Waxillium stopped and turned toward her. He was\nwearing his Roughs hat. He only did that when he was in full-on “tough\nlawman” mode. “I hear you brought this guy in.”\n“I did.”\n“Nice work.”\nThat should not have given her the thrill that it did. She didn’t need his\napproval.\nIt was nice nonetheless.\nHe continued to study her, as if on the verge of saying something more.\n“What?” Marasi asked."

Thing is, He spoke back.”\nShe cocked her head, trying to judge the meaning of that. But Waxillium\nLadrian was nothing if not earnest. Rusts, often he was too blunt.\n“All right,” she said. “What did he tell you?”\n“Our killer is a Faceless Immortal,” Waxillium said, starting down the\nsteps again. “A creature who calls herself Bleeder. She can change shapes\nby taking the bones of the dead, and she’s been driven mad. Even Harmony\ndoesn’t know her purposes.”\nMarasi followed him down, trying to swallow that. Mistwraiths and\nkandra … those were things out of the Historica, not real life. Then again,\nonce she would have said that men like Miles Hundredlives and Waxillium\nDawnshot were men out of stories. They’d lived up to the legends to a\nsurprising degree.\n“So that could be her,” Marasi said, gesturing toward the wall separating\nthem from the prisoner. “She could have any shape, any face! Why are you\nso sure this isn’t the killer?”\n“Because the governor is still alive,” Waxillium said softly. “The\ncreature who’s behind this casually murdered Winsting in a saferoom,\nbehind a wall of guards, after intentionally starting a firefight in the room\nabove. She wouldn’t be caught like this. It’s a taunt.” He looked to Marasi.\n“But I can’t be certain, not a hundred percent. So I need you to know what\nwe’re up against.”\nShe nodded to him and he nodded back, then he led the way out of the\nstairwell and around the corner toward the interrogation room. Marasi took\na bit of satisfaction in the fact that the corporal there looked to her for\nauthorization before opening the door for Waxillium.\nThe poor captive inside sat with his arms tied tight, staring at the table\nin front of him. He muttered softly. Waxillium walked straight up to the\ntable and took the other seat, settling down and putting his hat on the table.\nMarasi lingered back, where—in case they were wrong about the prisoner\n—she’d be out of reach but able to offer aid.\nWaxillium tapped the table with his index finger, as if trying to decide\nwhat to say. The prisoner, Rian, finally looked up.\n“She said you’d come talk to me,” Rian said softly.\n“She?” Waxillium said.\n“God.”\n“Harmony?”\n“No. She said I had to kill the governor. Had to attack him. I tried not to\nlisten.…”\nWaxillium narrowed his eyes. “You met her? What did she look like?\nWhat face was she wearing?”\n“You can’t save him,” Rian whispered. “She’s going to kill him. She\npromised me freedom, but here I am, bound. Oh, Ruin.” He took a deep\nbreath. “There is something for you. In my arm.”\n“In your…” Waxillium actually seemed disturbed. Marasi took an"

Marasi took an\nunconscious step forward, noticing for the first time a small bulge in the\nprisoner’s forearm.\nBefore she could quote the legal problems with doing so, Waxillium\nstood up and took that arm, making a quick slice in the skin. He pulled\nsomething out, bloody. A coin? Marasi stepped forward again as the\nprisoner reached to his head with his bleeding arm and started humming to\nhimself.\nWaxillium wiped off the coin with his handkerchief. He inspected it,\nthen turned it over. Then he grew very still, paling. He stood up suddenly.\n“Where did you get this?” he demanded.\nRian only continued humming.\n“Where?” Waxillium demanded, grabbing the man by the front of the\nshirt.\n“Waxillium,” Marasi said, running up, hand on his arm. “Stop.”\nHe looked to her, then dropped Rian.\n“What is that coin?” Marasi asked.\n“A message,” Waxillium said, shoving the coin in his pocket. “This man\nwon’t know anything of use. Bleeder knew we might capture him. Do you\nhave plans for tonight?”\nShe frowned. “What … why are you asking?”\n“Governor’s attending a party. Steris says he won’t cancel despite what\nhas happened, and this is the sort of thing she’s always right about. He’ll\nwant to put up a strong front, and won’t want his political enemies to think\nhe has anything to either hide or fear. We need to be at that party. Because I\nguarantee Bleeder will be.”\n8\nYoung Waxillium, age twelve, looked from one coin to the other. Both bore\na picture of the Lord Mistborn on the front, standing with his left arm\noutspread toward the Elendel Basin. On the back, each displayed a picture\nof the First Central Bank, in which his family owned a large stake.\n“Well?” Edwarn asked. He had a stern face and perfect hair. He wore his\nsuit like he’d been born in it—and to him it was a uniform of war.\n“I…” The youthful Waxillium looked from one to the other.\n“It is understandable you can’t spot the difference,” Edwarn said. “It\ntakes an expert, which is why so few of these have been discovered. More\nmay actually be in circulation; we can’t know how many. One of those is an\nordinary coin; the other has a very special defect.”\nThe carriage continued rattling through the streets as Waxillium studied\nthe coins. Then he unfocused his eyes. It was a trick he’d been taught by a\nfriend at a party recently, used for making two drawings spring to life by\noverlapping them.\nEyes unfocused, coins before him, he crossed his eyes intentionally and\nlet the images of the two coins overlap one another. When they locked into\nplace, the element of the picture that wasn’t the same—one of the pillars on\nthe bank building—fuzzed as his eyes were unable to focus on that point.\n“The mistake happened,” Uncle Edwarn continued, “because a defective\ncoin striker was used.

You won’t\nbe able to see it, but the error—”\n“It’s the pillars,” Waxillium said. “On the right side of the bank picture.\nThey are spaced too closely.”\n“Yes. How did you know that? Who told you?”\n“I saw it,” Waxillium said, handing the coins back.\n“Nonsense,” Uncle Edwarn said. “Your lie is not a believable one, but I\ncan respect your attempt at hiding your source.” He held up one of the\ncoins. “This is the most valuable defective coin in Elendel history. It’s\nworth as much as a small house. Studying it taught me something\nimportant.”\n“That rich people are foolish? They’ll pay more money for a coin than\nit’s worth?”\n“All people are foolish, just in different ways,” Uncle Edwarn said\noffhandedly. “That lesson I learned elsewhere. No, this coin showed me a\nharsh but invaluable truth. Money is meaningless.”\nWaxillium perked up. “What?”\n“Only expectation has value as currency, Waxillium,” Uncle Edwarn\nsaid. “This coin is worth more than the others because people think it is.\nThey expect it to be. The most important things in the world are worth only\nwhat people will pay for them. If you can raise someone’s expectation … if\nyou can make them need something … that is the source of wealth. Owning\nthings of value is secondary to creating things of value where none once\nexisted.”\nThe carriage stopped. Outside, an intimidating flight of stone steps led\nup to the very bank pictured on the coin. Uncle Edwarn waited for the\ncoachman to open his door, but Waxillium hopped down on his own.\nUncle Edwarn met him on the steps. “Your father,” Uncle said, “is\nhopeless with economics. I have worked on him for years, but he cannot—\nor will not—learn. I have great expectations of you, Waxillium. Banking is\nnot your only option for serving your house. However, after today I suspect\nyou will recognize it as the best one.”\n“I’m not going to be a banker,” Waxillium said, climbing the steps.\n“Oh? You have your eye on administering the teamsters after all?”\n“No,” Waxillium said. “I’m going to be a hero.”\nHis uncle chose not to reply immediately as they approached the top of\nthe steps. Finally, he said softly, “You are twelve years old, and you still\nspeak of this? I expect such foolishness from your sister, but your father\nshould have beaten it out of you by now.”\nWaxillium turned defiant eyes up at his uncle.\n“The day of heroes has passed,” Uncle Edwarn said. “The stories of\npeople breaking out of history belong to another world. We have reached an\nera of modernism, both louder and more silent at the same time. You watch.\nWhere once kings and warriors shaped the world, now quiet men in offices\nwill do the same—and do it far, far more effectively.”\nThey entered the bank lobby, which had a low ceiling and a wall of\ncagelike bars with hunched-over people inside who received or disbursed"

Waxillium’s uncle led him\naround to the back. The dark wood furnishings and mold-colored rug made\nit feel like dusk in the room, even with windows open and gas lamps\nburning.\n“There are two appointments today I wanted you to observe,” Uncle\nEdwarn said as they entered a long, unadorned room. The chairs faced the\nwall; this was a viewing room, a place to spy upon meetings in the bank.\nHis uncle gestured for him to sit, then pulled aside a panel in the wall,\nrevealing a glass slit that let them see the two people in the next room. One\nwas a male banker in a vest and slacks. He sat at an imposing desk,\nspeaking with a middle-aged man in dusty clothing, holding a felt cap in his\nfingers.\n“The loan will help us move up,” the dirty man said. “Get a place out of\nthe slums. I have three sons. We’ll work hard, I promise you we will.”\nThe banker looked down his nose at the man, then riffled through\npapers. Uncle Edwarn closed the slit, surprising Waxillium with the abrupt\nmotion. His uncle rose and Waxillium followed, moving to another set of\nchairs along the same wall. A second spy slit let them look in on another\nroom similar to the first. A female banker in vest and skirt sat behind a\nsimilarly intimidating desk. The patron, however, was tall, clean, and\nrelaxed.\n“Are you certain you need another boat, Lord Nikolin?” the banker\nasked.\n“Of course I’m certain. Would I bother coming here if I weren’t serious?\nHonestly. You people should allow my steward to make these arrangements.\nThat’s what stewards are for, after all.”\nUncle Edwarn closed the slit with a quiet snap, then turned to\nWaxillium. “You are watching a revolution.”\n“A revolution?” Waxillium asked. He’d studied banking—well, he’d\nbeen forced to study it by his tutors. “This sounds like what happens every\nday at a bank.”\n“Ah,” Uncle Edwarn said. “You know all this already. And to which of\nthese men will we give a loan?”\n“The rich one,” Waxillium said. “Assuming he’s not lying or acting\nsomehow.”\n“No, Nikolin is legitimately wealthy,” Uncle Edwarn said. “He has\nbanked with us numerous times in the past, and he never misses his\npayments.”\n“So you’ll loan money to him and not the other.”\n“Wrong,” Uncle Edwarn said. “We’ll lend to both.”\n“You’ll use the good credit of the rich man to underwrite the risk of\nhelping the poor man?”\nUncle Edwarn seemed surprised. “Your tutors have been diligent.”\nWaxillium shrugged, but inwardly he found himself growing interested.\nPerhaps this was a way to become a hero. Maybe Uncle Edwarn was right\nand the frontier was shrinking, the need for men of action vanishing. Maybe\nthis new world wasn’t at all like the one that the Ascendant Warrior and the\nSurvivor had lived in."

Maybe\nthis new world wasn’t at all like the one that the Ascendant Warrior and the\nSurvivor had lived in.\nWaxillium could carefully balance risks, and give money to those who\nneeded it. If men in suits would someday run the world, couldn’t they also\nmake it a better place?\n“Your assessment is correct on one hand,” Uncle Edwarn said, oblivious\nto the direction Waxillium had been thinking, “but flawed on the other. Yes,\nwe will lend to the poor man—but we will not accept risk to do so.”\n“But—”\n“The papers our banker is now presenting will tie the laborer in debt that\nis impossible to escape. If he fails to meet payments, his signature on that\npaper will allow us to go directly to his employer and take a percentage of\nhis wages. If that isn’t enough, we can do the same for his sons. The rich\nman has banked with us many times, and his house negotiated favorable\nterms. We will earn barely three percent on what we lend him. But the\nlaborer is desperate, and no other bank will consider him. He’ll pay us\ntwelve percent.”\nUncle Edwarn leaned in. “The other banks don’t see it yet. They lend\nsafely, and safely only. They have not changed as the world has. Workers\nearn more now than they ever did, and they’re hungry to pay for things once\noutside their reach. In the last six months we have pushed aggressively to\nlend to the common people of the city. They flock to us, and will soon make\nus very, very wealthy.”\n“You’ll make slaves of them,” Waxillium said, horrified.\nHis uncle took out the error coin and set it on the counter beside\nWaxillium. “This coin is a mistake. An embarrassment. Now it is worth\nmore than thousands of its companions combined. Value created where\nnone once existed. I will take the poor of this city and make of them the\nsame thing. As I said, a revolution.”\nWaxillium felt sick.\n“The coin is for you,” Uncle Edwarn said, standing. “I wish it to be a\nreminder. The gift that will—”\nWaxillium snatched the coin off the counter, then bolted out the door.\n“Waxillium!” his uncle called.\nThe bank was a labyrinth, but Waxillium found his way. He burst into\nthe small room where the poor man sat in consultation with the loan officer.\nThe laborer looked up from the stack of papers; he’d be barely literate. He\nwouldn’t even know what he was signing.\nWaxillium set the coin down on the desk before him. “This is a\nmisprinted coin, something that collectors covet. Take it, sell it at a\ncuriosities shop—don’t take less than two thousand for it—and use the\nmoney to move your family out of the slum. Don’t sign those documents.\nThey’ll be like a chain around your neck.”\n* * *\nWax paused in his story. He held the coin in front of him, studying it as he\nand Steris rode toward the party.\n“Well?” Steris asked, sitting across from him in the carriage. “What did\nyour uncle do?”"

        "text": "and Steris rode toward the party.\n“Well?” Steris asked, sitting across from him in the carriage. “What did\nyour uncle do?”\n“He was livid, of course,” Wax said. “The laborer signed the papers; he\ncouldn’t believe that I’d actually give him something so valuable. My uncle\ncame in, wove lies in the air like pretty puffs of colored smoke, and got his\ndocuments.”\nWax turned the coin over, looking at the image of the Lord Mistborn\npressed into the front. “The laborer—his name was Jendel—killed himself\nby jumping off a bridge eight years later. His sons are still in debt to the\nbank, though House Ladrian no longer owns an interest in the First Central\nBank; my uncle sold it off for capital before gutting the house and faking\nhis death.”\n“I’m sorry,” Steris said softly.\n“It’s part of what drove me away,” Wax said. “Events like that—and\nwhat happened in the Village, of course. I told myself I was setting out to\nfind adventure; I never intended to be a lawman. I think I knew, deep down,\nthat I couldn’t change anything in Elendel. It was too big, the men in suits\ntoo crafty. Out in the Roughs, one man with a gun meant something. Here,\nit’s hard to see him as anything other than a relic.”\nSteris pursed her lips, and obviously didn’t know what to say. Wax\ndidn’t blame her. He’d thought often of the events in that bank, and he still\ndidn’t know what—if anything—he could have done differently.\nHe flipped the coin over in his fingers. Scratched onto the back, in tiny\nletters, were the words Why did you leave, Wax?\n“How did Bleeder get the coin?” Steris asked.\n“I can’t fathom,” Wax said. “I sold it before going to the Roughs. My\nfather had cut me off by then, and I needed money to outfit myself for the\ntrip.”\n“And those words?”\n“I don’t know,” Wax said, pocketing the coin. “Thing is, remembering\nthat story bothers me. I told myself at the time that I was trying to help the\nman, but I don’t think that was true. Looking back, I was just trying to\nanger my uncle.\n“I’m still like that, Steris. Why did I leave for the Roughs? I wanted to\nbe a hero—I wanted to be seen and known. I could have done a great deal\nof good by taking a position in my house here in Elendel, but I’d have had\nto do it quietly. Leaving, then eventually trying to make a name for myself\nas a lawman, was ultimately selfish. Even joining the constables here\nsometimes seems like an act of insufferable hubris to me.”\n“I doubt that you care,” Steris said, leaning in, “but I consider your\nmotives to be irrelevant. You save lives. You … saved my life. My gratitude\nis not influenced by what was running through your head as you did so.”\nWax met her eyes. Steris was prone to this—startling moments of pure\nhonesty, where she stripped everything away and laid herself bare.\nThe carriage slowed, and Steris’s eyes flicked toward the window. “We"

There are many carriages in\nfront of us.”\nWax frowned, opening his window and leaning his head out. Indeed, a\nline of carriages and even a few motors clogged the way into the coach\nportico of ZoBell Tower. The skyscraper towered some twenty stories up\ninto the night sky, its top disappearing in the dark mists.\nWax pulled back into the carriage, mist tumbling in through the now-\nopen window beside him. Steris glanced at it, but did not ask him to close\nthe shade.\n“I guess we’ll be late,” Wax said.\nUnless, of course, he improvised.\n“This is the first party in the space atop the tower,” Steris said, taking a\nsmall planning notebook out of her handbag, “and the coach attendants\naren’t accustomed to this heavy traffic.”\nWax smiled. “You accounted for this delay, did you?”\nSteris stopped on a page in her notebook, then turned it around. There,\nin her neat handwriting, was a detailed agenda for their evening at the party.\nThe third entry read, 8:17. Way into the building likely blocked by traffic.\nLord Waxillium carries us up to the top floor by Allomancy, which is\ncompletely inappropriate and at the same time breathtaking.\nHe raised an eyebrow, checking his pocket watch, which he carried in\nhis gunbelt—not his vest—to be easily dropped with his other metals. “It’s\n8:13. You’re slipping.”\n“Traffic on the promenade was lighter than I expected.”\n“You really want to do this the hard way?”\n“I believe this will actually be the easy way,” Steris said. “Completely\ninappropriate though.”\n“Completely.”\n“Fortunately, you have a reputation for that sort of thing, and I can’t be\nexpected to keep you reined in. I did wear dark undergarments, though, so\nthey won’t be as visible from below while we are flying.”\nWax smiled, then reached under his seat, getting out the package that\nRanette had sent him. He tucked that under his arm, then pushed open the\ndoor. “People underestimate you, Steris.”\n“No,” she said, stepping out onto the misty sidewalk. He saw she wore\nshoes that fastened securely. Good. “They simply presume to know me\nwhen they do not. Understanding social conventions is not the same as\ncondoning them. Now, how is it that we are to—Oh!”\nShe said the last part as Wax gathered her to him in a close embrace,\nthen unholstered Vindication and shot a bullet into the ground—between\nthree cobblestones—at their feet. He grinned as heads popped out of\ncarriages all down the line. He’d have to leave Wayne and Marasi to fend\nfor themselves this way, but that was likely better. Might keep eyes off\nthose two.\nWax decreased his weight, oriented himself and Steris at the correct\nangle to the bullet, and Pushed.

He landed them on one of the skyscraper’s\ndecorative outcroppings a few stories up. Steris clung to him with the grip\nof a cat hanging above an ocean, her eyes wide. Then, cautiously, she\nreleased him and stepped up to the edge of the stonework, leaned out, and\npeered through the misty depths. Lights bobbed below: coaches,\nstreetlamps, lanterns held high by footmen. In the mist, most were just\nbubbles and shadows.\n“I feel like I’m afloat in a sea of smoke and fog,” she said. The mists\ntwisted and churned as if alive. Eddies and swirls seemed to move against\nthe currents of air, always in motion.\nWax opened Ranette’s package, getting out the length of tightly twined\nrope inside. He looked upward. Ranette’s note said she wanted him to\nexperiment with using a tether as he jumped with Allomancy, then provide\nher with feedback.\n“You were eager to come tonight,” Steris said. “It’s more than wanting\nto meet the governor. You’re working. I can see it in you.”\nWax hefted the rope—which was weighted at one end with a hooked\nsteel spike—getting a feel for what throwing it would be like.\n“I can tell, you see,” she said, “because you are fully awake. You are a\npredator, Waxillium Ladrian.”\n“I hunt predators.”\n“You are one too.” She looked at him through the translucent mists\ndancing between them. Her eyes were alight, reflecting the glow from the\nsea of fog below. “You are like a lion. Most days you’re only partially\npresent, with me. Lounging, half asleep. You do what you must, you fulfill\nthe needs of the house, but you don’t thrive. Then the prey appears. You\nwake. The burst of speed, the fury and power; the pounding, pulsing, rush\nof the hunt. This is the real you, Waxillium Ladrian.”\n“If what you say is true, then all lawmen are predators.”\n“True lawmen, perhaps. I don’t know that I’ve met another.” She\nfollowed his gaze as he looked upward. “So, my question. What do you\nhunt tonight?”\n“Bleeder will be here.”\n“The murderer? How do you know?”\n“She is going to try to kill the governor again,” Wax said. “She’ll want\nto test me, to see if she can get close, judge how I’ll react.”\n“You act as if it’s personal, between the two of you.”\n“I wish it were.” Someone else moves us. “I wish I knew Bleeder well\nenough for it to be personal, as that would give me an edge. But she\ncertainly is interested in me, and that means I can’t skip this party.\nOtherwise she might take it as a sign that she should strike.”\nWax finished coiling the rope in one hand, then held it with the spiked\nend dangling free.

He held out his hand, and Steris readily stepped up to\nhim.\nHe searched out a metal line that pointed toward one of the steel girders\nin the stone under his feet. With so much rock separating them, it wouldn’t\nbe as strong an anchor as otherwise—but it was large and solid, so it would\nwork for his purposes. Holding Steris, he Pushed off it into the night air.\nSkyscrapers like this one presented a problem for him, since they tapered as\nthey grew taller. In addition, many of the footholds he used were narrow\nledges, which made it hard to get a Push directly upward—those Pushes\noften sent him slightly outward, away from the building at an angle. Either\nway, the higher he went, the farther from the wall he got. Usually, he could\ncounter this with his shotgun and his ability to make himself lighter. That\nwouldn’t work while carrying Steris.\nRanette’s rope and spike might. He reached a height where he started to\nslow, his anchor getting too far to give him further lift. As usual, he’d\ndrifted out some ten feet from the building. So, as he slowed, he flipped the\nspiked end toward a balcony and Pushed on it, shooting the tether toward\nthe balcony frame. The hooked spike shot between the metal bars of the\nbalcony, but then pulled free. He drifted to a stop, precarious, in danger of\nfalling sideways away from the building. He cursed and tried again, and this\ntime got the hook to lock in place.\nHe pulled them inward, like a fish reeling itself in. That got them to the\nbalcony. He set Steris down and coiled the rope again, looking upward.\n“That was well performed.”\n“Too slow,” Wax said absently.\n“Oh dear.”\nHe smiled, gathered her again, and Pushed them upward off the balcony.\nThis time, as he drew near the halfway point to the party, he launched his\nhook toward a passing balcony at speed, hooking in place. He continued\nPushing himself, moving up past the balcony on his right. Then a sharp pull\non the rope made him pivot in the air as he flew, and he swung toward the\nbuilding.\nWax hit the side of the building boots first, rope in one hand, the other\narm wrapped around Steris. He then dropped them the few feet to the\nbalcony. Better, better. The great liability of a Coinshot like himself was\nthat he could only Push away from things, never Pull toward them. A tether\ncould be useful indeed.\nHe wiggled the hook free. This was awkward. What if he needed to\nunhook it while flying, or fighting? Could Ranette make that hook able to\nunhitch on command somehow? He Pushed on the balcony, sending them\nupward again. Steris dug her fingers into his shoulders. Mists streamed\nlazily about them. A Coinshot grew very comfortable with heights—no\nmatter how far he fell, dropping a single piece of metal and Pushing\ncarefully let him land unharmed.\n“I forget how disorienting this can be,” Wax said, slowing their ascent.\n“Close your eyes.”\n“No,” Steris said. She seemed breathless. “This is … this is wonderful.”\nI don’t think I’m ever going to understand that woman, he thought. He"

He\ncould have sworn she was terrified. The next few leaps went well as he got\nused to the tether. The rope is way too bulky, he thought. Lugging this\naround would be a serious pain. And the hook could easily get tangled. If\nhe were using this in a fight, he’d probably have to leave the rope tether\nbehind after the first leap.\nTonight it worked well enough though, and a moment later he swung\nthem onto the top-floor balcony in a flurry of skirts and mistcoat tassels. A\nsmall group of partygoers stood here, and Wax’s arrival caused surprised\nexclamations and one dropped glass. Wax straightened, letting Steris down.\nDespite what she’d been through, she quickly composed herself, settling her\nskirts and pulling back her hair to smooth straggling locks.\n“I believe,” she said softly, “that was an entrance befitting your station.”\n“Alerted the guards, at least,” Wax said, nodding to the men who stood\nat the sides of the balcony, watching them. The men were doing their job,\nwhich was good to see. A Coinshot couldn’t enter this party unnoticed.\nThey didn’t stop him, however. He was too important to bother.\nWax wound up the rope and spike, tying it at his waist within his coat,\nwhich made Steris roll her eyes. Then she rested her hand on his arm.\nBefore leaving Ladrian Mansion, she’d coached him with precision on how\nto walk and stand—her sixth such coaching during their time together.\nPerhaps that was because he never did it as he was supposed to. Indeed,\ntonight he took her by the arm in a more familiar way than she’d explained.\nThey were betrothed. Rusts, he could hold her by the arm.\nSteris eyed him, but said nothing as Wax Pushed open the balcony doors\nwith an Allomantic shove and they entered the party.\n9\nStanding at the foot of ZoBell Tower, Wayne watched Wax and Steris\ndisappear into the mists. He shook his head, then took a ball of gum from\nthe tin in his pocket. He’d gotten himself some of the stuff. It was actually\nfun to chew.\nHe popped it into his mouth and thought about what a rusted fool his\nfriend was. Obviously, Wax persisted with this whole engagement-to-Steris\nmess because he missed Lessie so much. So Wax had chosen a marriage\nthat demanded no emotional investment. That was easy to see as the bottom\nof your own glass at a pub with watered-down ale, that was.\nWayne held out his hand to help Marasi down from their coach. “You\nlook nice,” she told him. “I’m surprised you agreed to wear that.”\nWayne glanced down at his sharply tailored suit, chewing absently.\nMarasi acted amazed that he had a suit, matched by a fancy bowler on his\nhead and a dark green cravat. Why wouldn’t he have a costume like this?\nHe had beggar costumes, constable costumes, and old lady costumes. A\nfellow needed to be able to blend with his surroundings.

What’s going on up there?\nFancy people like this didn’t get turned away from parties, did they?\nEveryone had an invitation, even if his was forged. It was just like the one\nhe’d given to the old tyrant at the school though.\nWell, no telling until they arrived. And this line was still moving\nsloooooooowwwww.\n“That fellow you caught ever say anything useful?” he asked Marasi.\n“No,” Marasi said. “He isn’t all there, mentally. We did find what seems\nto be a Hemalurgic spike in him though.”\n“Rusts. You know ’bout that too?”\n“I got to read the book,” Marasi said absently. “Death did give it to me\nfirst, and Waxillium let me make a copy. Our captive had a piercing on\nsome skin in his chest. After we removed that, he calmed. But he still won’t\ntalk.”\nEventually, after seven crop rotations or so, they reached the front of the\nline. Marasi presented their invitation. The bouncer here looked it over, his\nface grim. “I’m afraid that we’ve been ordered to deny any nameless\ninvitations not in the possession of the people they were sent to. With the\nattempt on the governor’s life, only guests named on our list can be allowed\nin.”\n“But—” Marasi said.\n“Here now,” Wayne cut in. “We’re important people. Don’t you see how\nfancy my cravat is?”\nNear the door, men in black coats stepped forward, threatening. Rusting\ngovernment security. Constables, they were real people—oh, they might\nbust a man’s neck now and then, but they came from the streets same as\nanyone. These spooks though … they barely had any soul to them.\n“I saved the governor’s life today,” Marasi said. “Surely you won’t turn\nme away.”\n“There’s nothing I can do, I’m afraid,” the bouncer said, his stern face\ncompletely expressionless.\nYeah, something was going on here. Wayne grabbed Marasi’s arm,\ntowing her aside. “Let’s go. Rusting fools.”\n“But—”\nWayne glanced over his shoulder and, just at the right moment, tossed\nup a speed bubble. “Alrighty, then,” he said. “New plan!”\n“You sound excited,” she said, glancing at the borders of the speed\nbubble. It was more distinct than usual, as the mist inside the bubble\ncontinued to shift and move while that outside hung frozen in the air like\ngauze.\n“I’m an excitable type,” Wayne said, hurrying back to the lectern where\nthe bouncer stood.

I saved his life,\nthe bastard.”\n“Marasi!” Wayne said, grinning. “You’re startin’ to talk normal-like.”\n“Because of you,” she said, then paused. “Bastard.”\nHe grinned, chewing his gum loudly. “You saved the governor’s life,\nyeah, but it’s probably his security who want to keep you out, not him.\nThey’ve got mud on their faces because one of their own went rotten, and\nyou embarrassed them by noticing first.”\n“But that’s petty! They’re playing with the governor’s life!”\n“Men are petty.” He danced to the side.\n“Why are you moving like that?”\n“If I stay too long in one place, they have a chance of seeing me, even\nwith how fast we’re moving inside this bubble. If we keep moving we’ll be\na blur, and out in the mists that should be unnoticeable.”\nShe reluctantly started moving.\nWayne glanced over the lists again, recognizing a name. “Here now.\nThat one will work.”\n“Wayne, you’re going to get us into trouble, aren’t you?”\n“Only if we get caught!” He pointed. “They have two lists—people\nthey’re to turn away no matter what, and people they’re to allow. See the\nnotes? Fourth name down? Says he sent word he might not come, and\nthey’re to make certain nobody else uses his invitation.”\n“Wayne,” Marasi said, “that’s Professor Hanlanaze. He’s a brilliant\nmathematician.”\n“Hm,” Wayne said, rubbing his chin. “From the university.”\n“No, from New Seran. He’s been behind some of the discoveries in\ncombustion technology.”\nWayne perked up. “From outside the city. So people might not know\nhim.”\n“They will by reputation.”\n“But personally?”\n“He’s somewhat reclusive,” Marasi said. “He often gets invited to things\nlike this, but rarely comes. Wayne, I see that look in your eye. You can’t\nimitate him.”\n“What’s the worst that could come of it?”\n“We get caught,” she said, still walking with him around the speed\nbubble. “We get thrown in prison, prosecuted for conspiracy, embarrass\nWaxillium.”\n“Now that,” Wayne said, striding back to where he’d been standing\nwhen he’d sped up time, “is the best damn argument for trying this that\nanyone could make. Come back so I can drop this speed bubble.

Light from a dozen dim chandeliers played off\nwineglasses, diamond jewelry, sequins on sleek dresses. The dress style was\nnew. Was he so oblivious to fashion that he had missed such a dramatic\nshift?\nSteris wore more traditional attire—a kind of gauzy, draping white dress\nwith a very small bustle and a distinct waist. However, it had sequins lining\nthe collar and cuffs, and was more filmy—lighter than what she normally\nwore, and actually quite pretty on her. With the sequins, it shared something\nwith these modern gowns.\nThe party attendees moved around several bars and numerous small\ndisplays set up on the red-carpeted floor. Wax and Steris passed one, a stand\nwith a glass box enclosing a raw copper nugget as big as a man’s head.\nLight glimmered on its surface.\nAllomantic metals, Wax thought as they passed another display. Dozens\nof specimens, with plaques talking about where the nugget or vein had been\nmined. They provoked conversations around the room, clusters of people\nchatting as light played off the colorful drinks in their fingers.\n“You’re drawing attention,” Steris noted. “I’m not certain wearing the\ncoat was a wise move.”\n“The mistcoat is a symbol,” Wax said. “It is a reminder.” She’d talked\nhim out of the hat, but not this.\n“It makes you look like a ruffian.”\n“It’s supposed to. Maybe they’ll think twice about lying to me; I don’t\nwant to be part of their games.”\n“You are already part of their games, Lord Waxillium.”\n“Which is why I don’t like coming to the parties.” He held up his hand,\ncutting her off. “I know. It’s important that we be here. Let’s go chat with\nthe partygoers you’ve planned for us to approach.”\nShe always had a list, carefully prepared. Steris was the only person\nhe’d ever heard of who brought an agenda to a cocktail party.\n“No,” she said.\n“No?”\n“That is what we commonly do,” Steris said, giving a specific smile—\nshe practiced different ones—to Lady Mulgrave as they passed. “Tonight’s\npurpose is yours. Let us be about it and find that killer.”\n“Are you certain?”\n“Yes,” she said, waving to another couple. “It behooves a wife to be\ninterested in, if not involved in, the passions of her spouse.”\n“You don’t need to do that, Steris. I—”\n“Please,” she said softly. “I do.”\nWax let the argument drop. Truth was, he was pleased.

Unlike Allomancy—which burned at a\nfew standard rates—Feruchemical powers could be used up all at once.\nBleeder could drain her metalminds in a single burst of speed—and could\nprobably take down dozens of people in an eyeblink. Maybe even hundreds.\nAnd Wax wouldn’t be able to do a thing.\nBut perhaps she wouldn’t have enough left for that. She couldn’t just\npop more metal in, like an Allomancer, and refill her reserves. She’d have to\nrely on what speed she had been able to store up, and she’d only stolen her\nspike recently. Killing the people at Winsting’s party would have expended\na large amount of what she’d theoretically been able to save up over the last\nfew weeks.\nSo he had two options.

There was no better\nplace for a murderer to blend in than this.\nDrinks in hand, Wax stepped down from the bar and turned on his steel\nbubble.\nIt wasn’t something he’d always been able to do, and he wasn’t entirely\ncertain how he did it. Oh, the basic mechanics were obvious: he burned\nsteel, then Pushed lightly outward from himself in all directions at once.\nBut how had he learned to exempt metal he himself carried? He still didn’t\nknow. It was just something that had happened, over time.\nWith the bubble on, his Allomantic instincts searched out any bits of\nmetal moving quickly toward him, and would Push on those with increasing\nforce as they drew closer. He was getting better and better at that. Standing\nand letting Darriance shoot at his chest while wearing about twelve inches\nof padding and armor had helped. He couldn’t dodge bullets, but the bubble\nhelped.\n“What did you just do?” Steris asked as he reached her. “My bracelet\nwants to leap off my arm.”\n“Remove it,” Wax said. “If there’s an Allomantic fight, I don’t want you\nwearing any metals.”\nSteris raised an eyebrow, but took off the bracelet and dropped it in her\nhandbag. Wax mentally added an exception for it.\n“I don’t know that it will matter,” Steris said. “This place is positively\nteeming with metal. What are you doing with your drink?”\nWax looked up. He’d just finished covertly dumping a bit of brown\npowder into his cup. “I got water,” he said. “The powder will make it look\nlike I’m drinking brandy. If I can feign drunkenness later, it might give me\nan edge.”\n“Fascinating,” Steris said. She seemed genuinely impressed.\nThey moved through the room, passing under a chandelier.

The separate\nbits of crystal—which had wires suspending them—moved subtly away\nfrom Wax, like the needle of a compass confronted by a magnet’s matching\npole. He accidentally knocked a nugget off a pedestal as they passed. Rusts.\nAgainst his better judgment, he dampened his steel bubble.\n“Let’s find the governor,” Steris said.\nWax nodded. He couldn’t shake the feeling that no matter which way he\nturned, someone had a gun pointed at his back.\nSomeone else moves us, lawman.\nRed on the bricks. Lessie in his arms, already dead. His hands stained\nwith her blood.…\nNo. He’d moved past that. He’d grieved. He wouldn’t be sucked down\ninto that spiral again. As they continued through the party, a pair of lesser\nnobles wearing dark colors moved to intercept them, but Wax gave them a\nglare, which was enough to get them to back off.\n“Lord Waxillium…” Steris said.\n“What?” Wax asked. “You said we were going to the governor.”\n“That doesn’t mean you can growl at everyone else.”\n“I didn’t growl.” Did he?\n“Let me handle it next time,” Steris said, guiding them around a\npedestal displaying—oddly—nothing at all. The plaque read: ATIUM, THE\nLOST METAL.\nAs they neared the governor—who stood holding court near the\nwindows on the north side—a man in a bright yellow bow tie noticed Wax.\nGreat. Lord Stenet. He would want to talk about textile tariffs again. But of\ncourse he wouldn’t say that, not at first. People never said what they meant\naround here.\n“Lord Waxillium!” Stenet said. “I was just thinking about you! How are\nyour wedding arrangements proceeding? Should I look forward to an\ninvitation soon?”\n“Not too soon,” Steris said. “We’ve only just settled on a priest. What of\nyou? Your engagement is the talk of the city!”\nHis face fell. “Oh. Now, about that…” He cleared his throat. Steris\nprodded, but in a moment Stenet had found an excuse, changed the topic,\nthen politely retreated.\n“What was that about?” Wax said.\n“He’s been cheating on her,” Steris said absently. “Naturally, the topic\nmakes him uncomfortable.”\n“Nice work,” Wax said. “You’re very good at this.”\n“I’m proficient at it.”\n“I believe that’s what I said.”\n“There is a distinction,” Steris said with a shake of her head. “In this\nroom there are true masters of social interaction. I am not one of them. I\nstudied social norms, researched them, and now I execute them. Another\nwoman might have sailed through that conversation and left him happy, but\ndistracted. I had to use blunt force, so to speak.”\n“You are a bizarre woman, Steris.”\n“Says the only man in the room with guns on his hips,” she replied, “a\nman who is unconsciously trying to Push the earrings out of the ears of\nevery woman we pass. You didn’t notice Lady Remin losing her ring into\nher drink, did you?”\n“Missed that.”"

You didn’t notice Lady Remin losing her ring into\nher drink, did you?”\n“Missed that.”\n“Pity. It was entertaining. Here, step this way; we don’t want to get into\na conversation with Lord Bookers. He is dreadfully boring.”\nWax followed her down three steps, passing a display shining with\nnuggets of tin that rattled at his passing, alongside pictures of famous\nTineyes, including several sketches of the Lord Mistborn—who had been a\nTineye before the Catacendre. Funny, that Steris would remark on someone\nbeing boring.…\n“You’re thinking,” Steris said, “that it is ironic that I would note that\nsomeone is a bore—as I myself have a reputation for the same personality\nflaw.”\n“I would not have phrased it like that.”\n“It’s all right,” Steris said. “As I have said many times before, I am\naware of my reputation. I must embrace my nature. I recognize another bore\nas you might recognize a master Allomancer—as a colleague whose arts I\ndon’t particularly wish to sample.”\nWax found himself smiling.\n“As a side note,” Steris said softly as she steered them toward where the\ngovernor was speaking with the lord of House Erikell, “if you do find the\nmurderer, steer me in her direction. I shall endeavor to fascinate her with\ndetails of our house finances. With luck, she’ll fall asleep in her drink and\ndrown, and I shall have my first kill.”\n“Steris! That was actually amusing.”\nShe blushed. Then she got a conspiratorial look on her face. “I cheated,\nif you must know.”\n“… Cheated?”\n“I know you enjoy witty conversation,” she said, “so I prepared earlier,\nwriting myself a list of things I could say that you would find engaging.”\nWax laughed. “You have plans for everything, don’t you?”\n“I like to be thorough,” she said. “Though admittedly, sometimes I can\nbe so thorough that I end up needing to plan how to best make my plans.\nMy life ends up feeling like a beautiful ship in dry dock, built with eighteen\nrudders pointing in different directions to be extra certain that a steering\nmechanism is in place.” She hesitated, then blushed again. “Yes. That quip\nwas on my list.”\nWax laughed anyway. “Steris, I think this is the most genuine I’ve ever\nseen you.”\n“But I’m being fake. I prepared the lines ahead of time. I’m not actually\nbeing diverting.”\n“You’d be surprised at how many people do the same thing,” Wax said.\n“Besides, this is you. So it’s genuine.”\n“Then I’m always genuine.”\n“I guess so. I just didn’t realize it before.”\nThey stepped toward Innate, putting them close enough that the\ngovernor would notice them waiting. Nearby, other couples and groups shot\nthem covert looks. As the lord of a major house, Wax outranked almost\neveryone in the room. Old noble titles were coming to matter less and less,\nbut with Steris’s money backing him, he’d been able to dig himself out of\nmany of his debts.

That in turn had allowed him to avoid foreclosures, and\nhe’d been able to hold out until other investments came through. House\nLadrian was again one of the wealthiest in the city. Increasingly, that was\nmore important than a noble pedigree.\nHe found it unfortunate, though not surprising, how often noble birth\naligned with economic and political power. The Lord Mistborn’s laws,\nbased upon the Last Emperor’s ideal, were supposed to put power into the\nhands of common men. And yet the same groups just kept on ruling. Wax\nwas one of them. How guilty should he feel?\nAlready I fear that I have made things too easy for men.…\nDrim, the governor’s chief bodyguard and head of security, stepped up\nto Wax. “I suppose you’ll be next,” the thick-necked man growled. “My\nmen at the doors let you keep your guns, I hear.”\n“Let me tell you, Drim,” Wax said, “if the governor is in the slightest bit\nof danger, you want a gun in my hands.”\n“I suppose. A gun doesn’t mean much to you anyway, does it? You\ncould kill with the spare change in your pocket.”\n“Or a pair of cuff links. Or the tacks holding the carpet to the floor.”\nDrim grunted. “Too bad about your deputy.”\nWax snapped his attention on Drim. “Wayne. What about him?”\n“He’s a security threat,” Drim said. “Had to turn him away down\nbelow.”\nWax relaxed. “Oh. All right, then.”\nDrim smiled, obviously feeling he’d won something from the\nconversation. He backed up to take his place by the wall, watching those\nwho came to speak with the governor.\n“You’re not concerned about Wayne?” Steris asked softly.\n“Not anymore. I worried he’d find the party so boring, he would wander\noff. Instead, the good man there kindly gave Wayne a challenge.”\n“So … you’re saying he’ll sneak in?”\n“If Wayne isn’t in here somewhere already,” Wax said, “I’ll eat your\nhandbag and try to burn it for Allomantic power.”\nThey continued to wait. The governor’s current interlocutor, Lady\nShayna, was a long-winded blowhard, but after the political and financial\nsupport she’d given him, even the governor couldn’t turn her away. Wax\nlooked around, wondering where Wayne would be.\n“Lord Waxillium Ladrian,” a feminine voice said. “I’ve heard about\nyou. You’re more handsome than the stories say.”\nHe raised his eyebrows toward the speaker, a tall woman waiting to see\nthe governor. Very tall—she had a few inches on him at least. With luscious\nlips and a large chest, she had creamy skin and hair the color of gunpowder,\nand she was wearing a red dress missing most of its top half.\n“I don’t believe we’ve met,” Steris said, her voice cool.\n“I’m called Milan,” the woman said. She didn’t bother to look at Steris,\nbut inspected Wax up and down, then smiled in a mysterious way. “Lord\nWaxillium, you wear sidearms and a Roughs-style mistcoat to a cocktail\nparty. Bold.”"

Flirting with a man while his fiancée stands beside him, however …\n“You have an interesting reputation,” Milan continued. “Are the things\nthey say about you true?”\n“Yes.”\nShe pursed her lips, smiling, expecting more. Instead, he met her eyes\nand waited. She shuffled, moving her cup from one hand to another, then\nexcused herself, walking off.\n“Wow,” Steris said. “And they say I can make people uncomfortable.”\n“You learn the stare early,” Wax said, returning his attention to the\ngovernor. In the back of his mind, he assessed the woman Milan and\ndecided to keep an eye on her. Had that been Bleeder in disguise, trying to\nfeel him out? Or had it been just another foolish partygoer with a bit too\nmuch wine in her and an inflated opinion of how men would respond to\nher?\nRusts, this is going to be tough.\n* * *\nWayne sauntered about the party, his tiny dining plate stacked with food as\nhigh as he could get it. Why did they always use such tiny plates at fancy\nparties? To keep people from eating too much? Rusts. Rich folk didn’t make\nsense. They gave away the most expensive booze in the city, then worried\nabout people eating all of the little sausages?\nWayne was a rebel. He refused to play by their rules, yes he did. He\nquickly laid out a battle plan. The ladies with the little sausages came out\nfrom behind the east bar, while the west bar was preparing the salmon\ncrackers. Tiny sandwiches to the north, and desserts of various sorts to the\nsouth. If he made a round of the penthouse room in exactly thirteen\nminutes, he could hit each station just as the servants were entering with\nfresh platters.\nThey were starting to give him glares. A fellow knew he was doing his\njob right when he got those kinds of glares.\nMarasi stayed nearby, playing the part of Professor Hanlanaze’s\nassistant. Wayne scratched at his beard. He didn’t like beards, but Marasi\nsaid the few evanotype pictures of Professor Hanlanaze showed him\nwearing one. Hanlanaze was far thicker at the waist than Wayne was too.\nThat was great. You could hide all kinds of stuff in padding like that.\n“I still can’t believe you had all of this in the carriage,” Marasi\nwhispered, then she stole one of his sausages. Right off his plate.\nOutrageous!\n“My dear woman,” Wayne said, scratching his head, where he wore a\ncolorful Terris cap, a proud emblem of Hanlanaze’s lineage. “Being a\nqualified academic depends, before anything else, upon suitable\npreparation. I would no sooner leave my home without appropriate\nequipment for every eventuality than I would work in my lab without\nproper safety precautions!”\n“It’s the voice that truly makes the disguise, you know,” Marasi said.\n“How do you do it?”\n“Our accents are clothing for our thoughts, my dear,” Wayne said.\n“Without them, everything we say would be stripped bare, and we might as"

Oh look. The dessert lady has chocolate\npastries again! I do find those irresistible.”\nHe stepped toward them, but a comment cut him off. “Professor\nHanlanaze?”\nWayne froze.\n“Why, it is you!” the voice said. “I didn’t believe you’d actually come.”\nA tall man approached, wearing so much plaid that you could have strung\nhim up on a pole and made a war banner out of him.\nOn one hand Wayne was pleased. He’d only had Marasi’s description of\nHanlanaze to go on in creating his disguise, so the fact that he fooled\nsomeone who had obviously seen the professor’s picture was impressive.\nOn the other hand … damn.\nWayne handed Marasi his plate, giving her a stern glare that said “Don’t\neat these.” Then he took the newcomer’s hand. That suit’s fabric really was\nsomething. The mill that made it must have used up an entire year’s quota\nof stripes.\n“And you are?” Wayne asked, pinching his voice. He’d found that big\nmen like Professor Hanlanaze often had voices that sounded smaller than\nthe person was. He was glad he’d been studying southern accents. Of\ncourse he also injected some of a university accent into it, and set both on a\nbase of Thermolian “v” sounds, from the outer village where the professor\nhad grown up.\nGetting a good accent was like mixing a paint to match one already on a\nwall. If you didn’t blend just right, the flaws could look much worse than if\nyou’d chosen a different color entirely.\n“I’m Rame Maldor,” the man said, shaking Wayne’s hand. “You\nknow … the paper on the Higgens effect?”\n“Ah yes,” Wayne said, releasing the hand and stepping back. He gave a\ngood impression of being nervous around so many people, and it sold better\nthan two-penny drinks the day after Truefast. Indeed, Maldor was perfectly\nwilling to give the supposed recluse plenty of space.\nThat let Wayne speed up time around him and Marasi only.\n“What in Harmony’s wrists is he talking about?” Wayne hissed.\nFrom her bag, Marasi retrieved the book that she’d purchased at a\nnearby shop while Wayne was getting into his costume. She soon found the\npage she wanted. “The Higgens effect. Has to do with the way a spectral\nfield is influenced by magnets.” She flipped a few pages. “Here, try this.…”\nShe rattled off some gibberish to Wayne, who nodded and dropped the\nspeed bubble.\n“The Higgens effect is old news!” Wayne said. “I’m much more\ninterested in the way that a static electric field produces similar results.\nWhy, you should see the work we are near to completing!”\nRame got pale in the face. “But … But … I was going to study that\neffect myself!”\n“Then you’re behind by at least three years!”\n“Why didn’t you mention this in our letters?”\n“And reveal my next discovery?” Wayne said.\nRame stumbled away, then dashed for the lift.

It’ll stop them from sittin’ around and thinkin’ so much.”\n“Wayne, they’re scientists. Isn’t that their job?”\n“Hell if I know,” Wayne said, stuffing a little sausage in his mouth. “But\nrusts, if it is, that would explain so much.”\n* * *\nGovernor Innate finished his conversation and turned toward Wax. Drim,\nthe bodyguard, waved them forward. He didn’t like Wax, but from what\nWax knew of the man, Drim was solid, loyal and dependable. He\nunderstood that Wax wasn’t a threat.\nUnfortunately, Drim didn’t know the threat they were facing. A\nkandra … it could be anyone. Wax wouldn’t have been so trusting.\nWouldn’t I? he thought, shaking the governor’s hand. What if the kandra\nis Drim? Have I considered that?\nThat was how Bleeder had gotten in to kill Lord Winsting, after all. She\nhad been wearing the face of someone Winsting’s men trusted. Rusting iron\non a hillside, Wax thought. This is going to be very, very hard.\n“Lord Waxillium?” Innate asked. “Are you well?”\n“I’m sorry, my lord,” Wax said. “My thoughts were called away for a\nmoment. How is Lady Innate?”\n“She had a moment of passing nausea,” the governor said, kissing\nSteris’s hand. “And went home to lie down. I will tell her you asked after\nher. Lady Harms, you look lovely this evening.”\n“And you are ever a gentleman,” Steris replied, giving him a genuine\nsmile. Steris liked the governor, though politically they were opposites—\nSteris calculatedly progressive, as she figured would be expected of new\nmoney looking to advance, while Innate was conservative. But that sort of\nthing didn’t bother Steris. She liked people whose motives made sense, and\nshe felt Innate’s political record was orderly. “I hope Lady Allri will recover\nsoon.”\n“It is an ailment of nerves more than anything else,” Innate said. “She\ndid not react well to what happened today.”\n“You seem to be doing remarkably,” Wax said. “All things considered.”\n“The would-be assassin was one of our newer guards, and was mentally\nunhinged. He had terrible aim, and likely didn’t even actually intend to kill\nme.” The governor chuckled. “Would that the Survivor would always send\nsuch enemies to me, and often around election season.”\nWax cracked a forced smile, then glanced to the side. That woman from\nbefore, the pretty one with the large eyes, stood nearby. Who else was\nsuspiciously near?\nBleeder won’t be someone I can spot easily, Wax thought. The Faceless\nImmortals have centuries of practice blending into human society.\n“What is your take on it, Lord Waxillium?” Innate asked. “What were\nthe man’s motives?”"

Tomorrow at the latest. You need to hear what we’re dealing with.”\n“I will schedule it.” From Innate, that was a promise. Wax would have\nhis meeting. “Lady Harms, might I ask after your cousin?

The thoughts\nin his head were a voice, like Harmony’s, but rasping and crude. Brutal. A\nterrible whisper.\nWax was still wearing his earring. Bleeder had found out how to\ncommunicate with someone wearing a Hemalurgic spike.\nThe murderer was in his head.\n10\nWayne turned as the sausage lady passed. He intended to reach for another\nhandful. Instead he got slapped.\nHe blinked, at first assuming that the servers had finally gotten tired of\nhim outthinking them. But the slapper hadn’t been one of them. It was a\nchild. He fixed his stare on the young girl as Marasi hurried back to his side.\nWhy, this child couldn’t be more than fifteen. And she’d slapped him!\n“You,” the girl said, “are a monster.”\n“I—”\n“Remmingtel Tarcsel!” the girl said. “Do you think anyone in this party\nhas heard that name before?”\n“Well—”\n“No, they haven’t. I’ve asked. They all stand here using my father’s\nincandescent lights—which he toiled for years to create—and nobody\nknows his name. Do you know why, Mister Hanlanaze?”\n“I suspect I don’t—”\n“Because you stole his designs, and with them his life. My father died\nclipless, destitute and depressed, because of men like you.

The\nfun was gone, for some reason.\nInstead he went looking for Wax.\n* * *\n“Excuse me,” Wax said to the governor and Steris.\nBoth turned astonished eyes on him as he walked away. A rude move.\nHe didn’t let himself care. He stepped into the center of the room, instincts\nscreaming at him.\nGuns out!\nFirefight coming!\nFind cover!\nRun.\nHe did none of those things, but he couldn’t keep his eye from\ntwitching. With his steel burning, a spray of small, translucent blue lines\nconnected him to nearby sources of metal. He was in the habit of ignoring\nthose.\nNow he watched them. Quivering, shifting, the rhythm and pulse of a\nhundred people in a room. Trays for food, jewelry, spectacles. Metal parts\nin the tables and chairs. So much metal that made the framework for the\nlives of men and women. They were the flesh of civilization, and steel was\nnow its skeleton.\nSo, you realize what I am, the voice said in his mind.

Like\nliving up to your knees in sewage.\n“Why did you kill Winsting?” Wax asked out loud.\nI killed him because he had to die. I killed him because nobody else\nwould.\n“So you’re a hero,” Wax said, turning about. She’s close by, he thought.\nWatching me. Who? Which one?\nAnd if he thought he’d figured it out … did he dare fire first?\nThe strike of lightning is not a hero, Bleeder said. The earthquake is not\na hero. These things simply exist.\nWax started walking through the room. Perhaps Bleeder would try to\nmove along with him. He kept his hands to the sides, a coin in each fist. No\nguns yet. That would provoke a panic. “Why the governor?” Wax asked.\n“He is a good man.”\nThere are no good men, Bleeder said.

She tried to be\nsurreptitious about it, walking over to a group to meet them and chat—but\nshe moved parallel to Wax. There was another person following too. A short\nman in a server’s outfit carrying a tray of food. He made his rounds, but the\nother servers moved clockwise. Wax was going counterclockwise.\nWere they close enough to hear him speaking? Not with natural ears.\nPerhaps Bleeder could burn tin. If that was the power she’d chosen for the\nevening.\nYou are a surgeon too, Bleeder said. They call you lord, they smile at\nyou, but you aren’t one of them. If only you could be truly free. If only …\n“I follow the law,” Wax whispered. “What do you follow?”\nBleeder gave no reply to that. The whisper, perhaps, had kept her from\nhearing.\nThe governor is corrupt, Bleeder said. He spent years covering for his\nbrother, but in truth he would have done better covering for himself.\nWax looked to the side. He’d circled the room at this point, almost back\nto where he’d started. That server had followed all the way.\nI have much work to do, Bleeder said. I need to free everyone in this\ncity. Harmony crushes his palm against society, smothering it. He claims to\nnot interfere, but then moves us like pieces on a board."

But of course I can’t kill him yet, Wax. I haven’t\neven murdered your father yet.\nWax felt suddenly cold. But his father was already dead. He spun, hand\non his gun, and met the eyes of the server. The man froze, his eyes wide.\nThen he ran.\nWax cursed, dashing after and flipping a coin out in front of himself. It\nspun in the air, but the waiter ducked behind a group of people. Wax gritted\nhis teeth and let the coin drop without Pushing on it, instead unslinging\nVindication. This prompted cries of worry from those in the party. The\nwaiter ducked behind groups of people, ready to dodge Wax.\nFortunately, he—or she, or whatever—wasn’t ready for Wayne, who\nsurged out between two plump women with cups of wine and flung himself\nat the waiter. Both went down in a heap. Wax slowed, raising his gun,\ntaking aim. He couldn’t give Bleeder a chance to use Allomancy or\nFeruchemy, particularly if he was wrong about her using tin right now. A\nshot to the head wouldn’t kill a kandra, he guessed, but it should slow her\ndown. Wax just had to be certain not to hit Wayne in the wrong—\nThe governor’s guards piled on top of Wayne and Bleeder. Wax cursed,\ndashing forward, Vindication up beside his head and mistcoat flapping\nbehind him. He leaped over cowering partygoers—Pushing off tacks in the\nfloor to get some height—and came down near the group of struggling\nguards.\nWayne, wearing a false beard and swearing like a canal worker with a\nheadache, flailed about as five security guards held him.\n“Let him go!” Wax said. “That’s my deputy. Where’s the other one?”\nThe guards stumbled about, all but one, who lay on the floor. Bleeding\nfrom the gut.\nWax snapped his head up, spotting a man in a waiter’s outfit pushing his\nway toward the room’s outer wall nearby. Wax leveled Vindication and took\naim.\nYou should know, Bleeder said, that I was sad about your lover’s death. I\nhated that it was necessary.\nWax’s hand froze. Lessie. Dead.\nDamn it, I’m past that! Wax squeezed the trigger anyway, but Bleeder\nducked, skidding to the ground. The bullet punched a hole in the window\nabove the man’s head.\nBleeder threw a chair at the weakened window, shattering it. Then, as\nWax fired again, he leaped through.\nTwenty-plus stories in the air.\nWax bellowed, charging toward the window. Wayne joined him,\ngrabbing Wax by the arm. “I’ll hold on tightly, mate. Let’s go.”\n“Stay,” Wax said, forcing himself to think through his turmoil of\nemotions. “Watch the governor.

The chill of mist on the skin.\nHe opened his eyes to spinning white upon black, mist dancing about\nhim, inviting, eager. All Allomancers shared a bond with the mists, but the\nother types never knew the thrill of jumping through them. Of nearly\nbecoming one with them. During moments like this, Wax understood the\nAscendant Warrior. Vin—they rarely called her by name. Her title, like\nthose of the other Preservers, was used to show reverence.\nThe Historica, a section of the Words of Founding, said she had melded\nwith the mists. She had taken them upon herself, becoming their guardian\nas they became her essence. As the Survivor watched over all who\nstruggled, Vin watched over those in the night. Sometimes he felt he could\nsee her form in their patterns: slight of frame, short hair splayed out as she\nmoved, mistcloak fluttering behind her.\nIt was a fancy, wasn’t it?\nWax fired Vindication, slamming a bullet into the ground and Pushing\non it to stop his descent. He hit the street in front of the building lobby,\ngoing down on one knee. Nearby, some hopefuls still waited to be allowed\ninto the party.\n“Where?” Wax demanded, looking at them. “Someone fell before me.\nWhere did he go?”\nI haven’t even murdered your father yet.…\nRusts. Could she mean Steris’s father, his soon to be father-in-law?\n“There … there was nobody,” said a man in a black suit. “Just that.” He\npointed to a smashed chair.\nIn the distance, a motorcar roared to life. It tore away with a frantic\nsound.\nBleeder might be a Coinshot now, Wax thought, running toward the\nsound, hoping it was her. But she wouldn’t need a motorcar if that were the\ncase. Maybe she’d chosen the Feruchemical power to change her weight, so\nshe could drift down on the wind.\nWax launched himself upward, watching the steel lines for movement.\nIn the mists ordinary vision was of limited use, but steelsight’s blue lines\npierced the mists like arrows. He could easily make out the motorcar\nspeeding away, but he didn’t know for certain Bleeder was in it. He took a\nmoment to watch the movements of other vehicles nearby. A carriage pulled\nto a stop one street away. He could tell from the way the lines quivered—\nthose would be the metal fittings on the horse’s harness. People on foot\nwalked slowly along Tindwyl Promenade. Nothing suspicious.\nDecision made, he Pushed against some streetlamps, sending himself\nafter the speeding motorcar. He bounded from lamp to lamp, then launched\nhimself over the top of a building as the motor turned a corner. Wax crested\nthe building in a rush of swirling mists, passing only a few feet over the top.\nA group of young boys playing on the roof watched him pass with dropped\njaws. Wax landed on the far edge of the rooftop, mistcoat tassels spraying\nforward around him, then leaped down as the motor passed below."

Wax landed on the far edge of the rooftop, mistcoat tassels spraying\nforward around him, then leaped down as the motor passed below.\nThis, he thought, will not work out as well as you hoped, Bleeder.\nWax increased his weight, then Pushed on the motor from above.\nHe didn’t crush the person inside—he couldn’t be absolutely sure he\nhad the right quarry. His carefully pressed weight did pop the wheels like\ntomatoes, then squashed the roof down just enough to bend the metal doors\nin their housings. Even if Bleeder had access to enhanced speed, she\nwouldn’t be getting out through those doors.\nWax landed beside the motorcar, Vindication out and pointed through\nthe window at a confused man wearing a cabbie’s hat. Motorcar cabbies?\nWhen had that started happening?\n“He got out!” the cabbie said. “Two streets back. Told me to keep\ndriving; didn’t even let me stop as he jumped!”\nWax kept perfectly still, gun right at the cabbie’s forehead. It could be\nBleeder. She could change faces.\n“P-please…” the cabbie said, crying. “I…”\nDamn it! Wax didn’t know enough. Harmony. Is it him?\nHe was returned a vague sense of uncertainty. Harmony didn’t know.\nWax growled, but lifted his gun away from the frightened driver,\ntrusting his gut. “Where did you let him off?”\n“Tage Street.”\n“Go to the Fourth Octant precinct station,” Wax said. “Wait for me, or\nconstables I send. We’ll likely have questions for you. Once I’m satisfied,\nwe’ll buy you a new motor.”\nWax Pushed himself into the air to the corner of Tage and Guillem,\nwhich put him at the edge of a maze of industrial alleyways linking\nwarehouses with the docks where canal boats unloaded. Steelsight on and\nPushing bubble up, he crept through the mists, but didn’t have much hope.\nHe’d have a devil of a time finding one man alone here, in the dark.\nAll Bleeder had to do was pick one place and hide there. Many\ncriminals didn’t make the wise choice in this situation, however. It was hard\nto remain perfectly still, not moving any metal, while an Allomancer\nprowled about looking for you.\nWax persisted, walking down a dark alleyway, checking the rope at his\nwaist, making sure he could unwind it quickly in case Bleeder was a\nCoinshot or a Lurcher and he needed to dump his metals. Soon the mists\nfilling in behind him made him feel as if he were in an endless corridor,\nvanishing into nothingness in both directions. Above as well, only dark,\nswirling mists. Wax stopped in an empty intersection, silent warehouses like\nleviathans slumbering in the deep on all four corners, only one of which\nheld a streetlight. He looked about with steelsight, waiting, counting\nheartbeats.\nNothing.\nEither the cabbie had been Bleeder in disguise, or Wax’s prey had\nslipped away.

Wax sighed, lowering his gun.\nOne of the large warehouse doors fell outward with a crash, revealing a\ndozen men. Wax felt a sweeping wave of relief. He hadn’t lost his quarry—\nhe’d simply been led into a trap!\nWait.\nDamn, Wax thought, leveling Vindication and pulling his Sterrion from\nhis hip. He Pushed on the men in the same movement, which flung him\nbackward toward the cover of a half-finished building.\nUnfortunately, the men opened fire before he arrived. Wax’s steel bubble\ndeflected a number of the shots, bending them away to cut empty air. The\nbullets trailed streaks in the mist. One, however, clipped him on the arm.\nWax gasped as his Push slammed him against an incomplete wall. He\nfired a shot into the ground, then Pushed on it, backflipping himself over the\nbrick wall and behind cover.\nBullets continued to pelt the bricks as Wax dropped a gun and pressed\nhis left hand to the underside of his right upper arm with a flare of pain and\nblood. The men on the other side of the wall kept firing, and some of the\nbullets didn’t have blue lines. Aluminum bullets. Bleeder was far better\nfunded than Wax had expected.\nWhy keep firing so rabidly? Were they trying to bring the wall down\nwith the force of their shots? No. They’re trying to hold my attention so I\ncan be flanked.\nWax grabbed Vindication, holding his bleeding arm as he raised it—it\nhurt—just as several shadows wearing no metal ducked into the other side\nof the building site. Wax plugged the first one in the head, then dropped the\nsecond with a shot to the neck. Three others knelt, raising crossbows.\nSomething pulled one of them into the shadows. Wax faintly heard an\nurk of pain just before he fired at the second. He turned his gun toward the\nthird to find it slumping down, something stuck into its head. A knife?\n“Wayne?” Wax asked, hurriedly reloading Vindication with bloody\nfingers.\n“Not exactly,” a feminine voice said. A tall figure crawled through the\nmists, moving over a pile of bricks to reach him. As she drew closer, he\ncould make out large eyes, jet hair, and a sleekly elegant gown—that was\nnow missing the bottom half, below the knees. The woman from the party,\nthe one who had tried flirting with him.\nWax flipped Vindication, reloaded, up in a smooth motion, pointing it at\nthe woman’s head. The bullets outside stopped pounding the wall. The\nsilence was far more ominous.\n“Oh please,” the woman said, pulling up beside the wall with him.\n“Why would I save you if I were an enemy?”\nBecause you could be Bleeder, Wax thought. Anyone could.\n“Um … you’re hurt,” the woman said. “How bad is that? Because we\nshould really start running right now. They’re going to come charging in\nhere shortly.”\nDamn. Not much choice. Trust her and potentially die, or not trust her\nand almost certainly die.\n“Come here,” Wax said, grabbing the woman and pulling her close. He\npointed Vindication at the ground."

He\npointed Vindication at the ground.\n“They have snipers,” she said. “On five roofs, watching for you to Push\ninto the mists. Aluminum bullets.”\n“How do you know?”\n“Overheard those fellows with the bows whispering as they moved\naround to come get you.”\nWax growled. “Who are you?” he said through gritted teeth.\n“Does it matter right now?”\n“No.”\n“Can you run?”\n“Yes. It’s not as bad as it looks.” Wax took off, the woman running at\nhis side. The wound hurt like hell, but there was something about the\nmists.… He felt stronger in them. It shouldn’t be so—he was no Pewterarm\n—but there it was.\nIn truth, getting shot was bad, but not as bad as people often made it out\nto be. This shot had gone through the skin and muscle under his arm,\nmaking it difficult to raise, but he wouldn’t bleed out. Most bullets wouldn’t\nactually stop a man; psychologically, the panic of being shot did the most\nharm.\nThe two of them charged out the back side of the building, past the man\nwith a knife in his head. Behind them shouts rose in the mist, and a few of\nthe ambushers trying to get into the building took wild shots.\nThe woman ran well despite being in a gown. Yes, she’d ripped off the\nbottom half, but she still seemed to run too easily, without seeming to break\na sweat or breathe deeply.\nBlue lines. Ahead.\nWax grabbed Milan by the arm, yanking her to the side into an alleyway\nas a group of four men burst out of a cross street, leveling guns.\n“Rusts!” Wax said, peeking around the corner. This short alleyway\nended at a wall. The thugs had him surrounded.\n“How many men does Bleeder have?” Wax muttered with another curse,\nunder his breath.\n“These can’t be Bleeder’s men,” Milan said. “How would she have\nrecruited such an army? In the past she’s always worked on her own.”\nWax looked at her sharply. How much did she know about all this?\n“We’re going to have to fight,” Milan said as shouts sounded from\nbehind them. She reached to her chest, where her gown exposed\nconsiderable cleavage.\nWaxillium had seen some odd things in his life. He’d visited koloss\ncamps in the Roughs, even been invited to join their numbers. He’d met and\nspoken with God himself and had received a personal gift from Death. That\ndid not prepare him for the sight of a pretty young woman’s chest turning\nnearly transparent, one of the breasts splitting and offering up the hilt of a\nsmall handgun.\nShe grabbed it and pulled it out. “So convenient,” she noted. “You can\nstore all sorts of things in those.”\n“Who are you?”\n“MeLaan,” she said, rising and holding her gun in two hands.

As soon as she stopped speaking, he heard a\nrustling in his mind. You can trust this one. Harmony’s voice, accompanied\nby a sense of endlessness, a vision like he’d seen before. It was as good a\nconfirmation as he could get that this wasn’t Bleeder.\nWax narrowed his eyes at the woman anyway. “Wait. I think I know\nyou.”\nShe grinned. “We’ve met once before tonight. I’m charmed you\nremember. You want the ones in the back or the front?”\nAt least a dozen chasing them. Four ahead. He had to trust someone,\nsometime. “I’ll take the ones behind.”\n“Such a gentleman,” she said. “By the way, technically I’m not\nsupposed to kill people. I … uh … think I already broke that rule tonight. If\nwe happen to survive, please don’t tell TenSoon that I murdered a bunch of\npeople again. It upsets him.”\n“Sure. I can do that.”\nShe grinned—whoever she was, this side of her was completely\ndifferent from what she’d displayed previously. “Say when to go.”\nWax peeked around the corner. Dark figures moved in the mist behind\nthem, coming up on their position. If she was right, and this wasn’t Bleeder,\nthen who …\nAluminum bullets. Snipers to watch for his escape.\nIt was his uncle. Somehow Wax had been played. Oh, Harmony … If\nBleeder and the Set were working together …\nHe tossed a bullet casing to the side, against the wall to his right, and\nheld it in place with a light Allomantic push. He flexed his wounded arm,\nthen raised both guns. “Go.”\nWax didn’t wait to see what MeLaan did. He Pushed against the casing,\nthrowing himself out into the street, churning the mist. Men fired, and Wax\nincreased his weight, then Pushed with a sweeping blast of Allomantic\npower. Some weapons were thrown backward, and some bullets stopped in\nthe air. Men grunted as his Push sent them away.\nTwo men’s weapons weren’t affected by the Push. Wax shot them first.\nThey fell, and he didn’t give the other men time to go for the aluminum\nguns. He decreased his weight greatly and Pushed against the men behind\nhim, hoping that the shove helped MeLaan.\nHis Push sent him into the middle of the men he was fighting. He\nlanded, kicking one of the aluminum guns away into the mists, then\nlowered Vindication and drilled a thug in the head, just at the ear. The\ncracks of his gunfire rang in the night.\nWax kept firing, dropping the men around him as he spun through the\nmists. Some came at him with dueling canes while others fell back with\nbows. No Allomancers that he’d spotted. In the night, he could finally prove\nthe worth of the mistcoat. As he dodged between the thugs—kicking the\nother aluminum gun away—the tassels on his coat spun in the air, seeming\nto meld with the mists. Men attacked where he had been, the tassels\nconfusing them as they churned the fog."

Then he turned and leveled both weapons\nat the man who had been sneaking up on him.\nBoth out, I believe. He pulled the triggers anyway. The weapons clicked.\nThe terrified man stumbled back, then paused. “He’s out! Move! He’s\ndefenseless!” The man charged forward.\nWax dropped the guns.\nWhy, exactly, would they assume that I need guns to be dangerous?\nHe reached into his coat and undid the rope at his waist. He pulled it\nfree, draping the rope from his fingers. Ranette’s hook clinked as it hit the\nground.\nThe man in front of him hesitated at the sound, dueling cane held\nnervously.\n“This,” Wax said, “is how it used to be done.”\nHe yanked the rope, whipping the metal end into the air, then Pushed\nthe spike at the man’s chest, letting the rope move through his fingers to\ngive it more slack. It hit, cracking ribs, and Wax yanked the rope back,\nholding it on a tight leash and spinning the hook through the air as he\nturned. He Pushed again, slamming the metal into the man raising a bow.\nWax twisted and knelt, whipping the rope around. It spun before him in\na grand arc, stirring the mist as he gave the rope more slack, then Pushed it,\nslamming the spike-hook past one man and into another’s chest. Wax\nyanked the spike-hook back, catching the other man on the thigh, tripping\nhim as he came forward with a dueling cane.\nWax caught the hook in one hand and turned, Pushing the hook forward\ninto the shoulder of an ambusher. Wax ripped it free with a yank, then\nPushed it directly back into the man’s face.\nOne more, he thought. Wax whirled, pulling the hook back into his\nhand, searching.\nThe last man scrambled for something on the ground. He looked up,\nraising one of the fallen aluminum guns. “The Set sends its regards, law—”\nHe cut off as a shadow behind him rammed a knife into his back.\n“Here’s a tip, kid,” MeLaan said. “Save the wisecracks until your foe is\ndead. Like this. See how easy it is?” She kicked the corpse in the face.\nWax looked around at the fallen and groaning men. He held the rope\ntightly. Those sharpshooters on the roofs might reposition soon and start\nfiring. “We need to move fast. I think Bleeder is going after Lord Harms,\nmy betrothed’s father.”\n“Damn,” MeLaan said. “You want to try to climb up and go after those\nsharpshooters?”\n“No time,” Wax whispered.

He didn’t know if those\nsharpshooters might be Metalborn, set to watch for lines of metal in the\nmists.\nJust in case, he heaved the corpse overhead and Pushed, lobbing it\nupward through the mists. Then he Pushed on his gunbelt, sending it flying\nahead of him down the street.\nFinally he ran, chasing after the gunbelt and using Allomancy to knock\nit up and forward again as it started to fall. A gunshot broke the night, but\nhe couldn’t pinpoint its origin. He didn’t know if the sharpshooter was\ntrying to hit the corpse, his gunbelt, or him.

He figured that would soon change, when Marasi returned\nwith some more constables. She’d run off to fetch them, and give a report.\nThat meant Wayne was the sole officer of lawkeepin’ in the vicinity. A\nfrightening thought.\n“I’ve got one more question for you,” Wayne said to the woman.\n“Yes, officer?” she asked.\n“Where’d you get those shoes?”\nThe woman blinked, then looked down. “Um … My shoes?”\n“Yeah, your shoes,” Wayne said. “Look plenty comfortable, they do.\nCan never have too many pairs of black pumps. They go with rusting\neverything.”\nShe looked back at him. “You’re a man.”\n“Sure am,” Wayne said. “Checked last time I pissed. The shoes?”\n“Rousseau’s,” she said. “Third Octant, on Yomen Street.” She paused.\n“They were on sale last week.”\n“Damn!” Wayne said. “That’s beautiful. Thanks. You’re free to go.”\nShe gave him that look that people seemed to give only to Wayne, the\none he hadn’t quite figured. Ah well. He wrote down the name of the shop.\nIf he had to wear those awful pumps from his disguise box one more time,\nhe’d probably go insane.\nHe popped a ball of gum into his mouth and wandered over toward the\npile of guards, going over his notes. That server up above, he thought,\ntapping his pad with his pencil, was not the kandra. Wayne had talked to a\ndozen of the staff. All knew the fellow and said he hadn’t been acting\nstrange at all. But none of them liked him. He was a screwup, and none\nwere surprised that he’d turned out to be rotten.\nAn amateur might think that picking the new guy made for a good\ndisguise, but this Bleeder, she could be anyone. Why would she pick the\nlow man on the list, someone who had only joined the staff a few weeks\nback? Sure, being new would give you an excuse to not know people’s\nnames, but by reports, this fellow hadn’t forgotten anyone’s name tonight.\nAnd picking a habitual klutz with a bad reputation would just lead to\neveryone watching over your shoulder. A terrible choice for an imitator.\nThat guy had been some other kind of mole. He shook his head.\n“Where’s Drim?” he asked the guards. “I wanna show him what I’ve\ngot.”\nThe guard leaned over, looking at Wayne’s notepad. “All that’s on there\nis a bunch of scribbles.”\n“It’s for show,” Wayne said. “Makes people talk more if they think\nyou’re writin’ stuff down. Dunno why. I sure wouldn’t want anyone\nrememberin’ the slag I say.…” He hesitated, then shoved aside the guard,\nlooking into the middle of the pile. Drim wasn’t there, and neither was the\ngovernor.\n“What’d you do with him!” Wayne said, turning on the others. A smug\ngroup of bastards, they were.\n“It was best everyone thought he was still here,” the guard said. “In\ntruth, he and Drim headed to a secure location ages ago. If we fooled you,"

If we fooled you,\nthen hopefully we fooled the assassin.”\n“Fooled … I’m supposed to be protectin’ the guy!”\n“Well, you’re doing a rusting good job of that, mate, ain’tcha,” the\nguard said, then smirked.\nSo Wayne did the only reasonable thing. He spat out his gum, then\ndecked the fellow.\n* * *\nWax rarely appreciated the city as much as he did when he needed to get\nsomewhere quickly.\nTo the eyes of a man burning steel, Elendel was alight and full of\nmotion, even while shadowed by darkness and mist. Metal. In some ways,\nthat was the true mark of mankind. Man tamed the stones, the bones of the\nearth below. Man tamed the fire, that ephemeral, consuming soul of life.\nAnd combining the two, he drew forth the marrow of the rocks themselves,\nthen made molten tools.\nWax passed among the skyscrapers like a whisper, the motion drying his\nclothing. He became just another current in the mists, and moving with him\nin radial spokes was a majestic network of blue lines—like a million\noutstretched fingers pointing the way to anchors he could use along his\npath. When even a galloping horse was too slow, Wax had steel. It burned in\nhim, returning to the fire that gave it shape.\nFrom it he drew power. Sometimes that wasn’t enough.\nBut this night, he exploded through the lit upper windows of the Harms\ndwelling, rolling and coming up with guns leveled. Lord Harms swiveled in\nthe chair of his writing desk, knocking over his pot of ink. The red-faced\nolder man had a comfortable paunch, an easy manner, and a pair of\nmustaches that were in competition with his jowls to see which could droop\nfarthest toward the floor. Upon seeing Wax, he started, then scrambled to\nreach into his desk drawer.\nWax scanned the room. Nobody else there. No enemies in the corners,\nno moving bits of metal in closets or the bedroom. He’d arrived in time.\nWax let out a sigh of relief, standing up as Lord Harms finally got his desk\ndrawer open. The man whipped out a pistol, one of the modern semiautos\nthat were popular with the constables. Harms leaped to his feet and rushed\nover to Wax, holding his gun in two hands.\n“Where are they!” Harms exclaimed. “We can take them, eh, old boy?”\n“You have a gun,” Wax said.\n“Yes indeed, yes indeed. After what happened last year, I realized that a\nman has to be armed. What’s the emergency? I’ll have your back!”\nWax carefully tipped the point of Lord Harms’s gun downward, just in\ncase a bullet was chambered—because, fortunately, the man hadn’t locked a\nmagazine into the pistol. Wax glanced behind at the windows. He’d flung\nthem open with a Push as he approached, but they were meant to open\noutward, not inward. He’d ripped both right off their hinges, toppling one\nwhile the other hung by its corner. It finally gave way, crashing to the floor,"

It finally gave way, crashing to the floor,\ncracking the glass inside the wooden frame.\nMist poured in through the opening, flooding the floor. Where was\nBleeder? In the house somewhere? Impersonating a maid? A neighbor? A\nconstable passing on the street?\nStanding in the room with him?\n“Jackstom,” Wax said, looking to Lord Harms, “do you remember when\nyou first met me, and Wayne was pretending to be my butler?”\nHarms frowned. “You mean your uncle?”\nGood, Wax thought. An impostor wouldn’t know that, would she?\nRusts … He’d have to suspect everyone.\n“You’re in danger,” Wax said, sliding his guns into their hip holsters.\nHis suit was basically ruined from the swim in the canal, and he’d tossed\naside his cravat, but the sturdy mistcoat had seen far worse than this. “I’m\ngetting you out of here.”\n“But…” Lord Harms trailed off, face blanching. “My daughter?”\nAs if he had only one.\n“Steris is fine,” Wax said. “Wayne is watching her. Let’s go.”\nThe problem was, go where? Wax had a hundred places he could take\nHarms, but Bleeder could be lurking at any of them. The odds were\ncertainly in Wax’s favor, and yet …\nBleeder is ancient, Harmony had said. Older than the destruction of the\nworld. She is crafty, careful, and brilliant.… She spent centuries studying\nhuman behavior.\nAny option Wax chose could be the very one Bleeder had predicted he\nwould choose. How did you outthink something so old, so knowledgeable?\nThe solution seemed easy. You didn’t try.\n* * *\nSteris left ZoBell Tower to find Wayne sitting across the street from a\nhuddle of bruised and obviously angry men. Wayne was eating a sandwich.\n“Oh, Wayne,” she said, looking from the hostile, wounded men and\nback to him. “Those are the governor’s guards. He’s going to need them\ntonight.”\n“’s not my fault,” Wayne said. “They was bein’ unaccommodating.” He\ntook a bite of his sandwich.\nShe sighed, settling down beside him and looking up through the mists\ntoward the tower. She could make out the lights on various floors glowing\nlike phantoms above, leading all the way up to the very top.\n“This is how it’s going to be, with him, isn’t it?” she asked. “Always\nbeing left behind in the middle of something? Always half feeling as if I’m\npart of his life?”\nWayne shrugged. “You could do the noble thing, Steris. Give up on the\nwhole marriage. Let him loose to find someone he actually likes.”\n“And my family’s investment in him and his house?”\n“Well, I know this here is revolutionary words, Steris, but you can loan\na chap money without him havin’ to jump you in appreciation, if you know\nmy meanin’.”\nGood Harmony he could be shockingly unmannered.

Was he expecting her to fight back, prove herself\nsomehow? She’d never been able to figure this man out. Preparing what to\nsay to him only seemed to make him more vulgar.\n“Did he say where he was going?” she said, trying to remain polite.\n“Nah,” Wayne said, taking a bite of his sandwich. “He’s chasin’ Bleeder\ndown. Means he could have gone anywhere, and so tryin’ to find him is\nuseless. He’ll come back for me when he can. If I leave, I’ll just end up\nmissing him.”\n“I see.” She settled back, crossing her feet on the curb and staring up at\nthose lights. “Do you hate me because of what I represent, Wayne? The\nresponsibilities that called him back?”\n“I don’t hate you,” Wayne said. “I find you repulsive. That there is an\nimportant distinction, it is.”\n“But—”\nWayne stood up. He shoved the rest of the sandwich into his mouth.\nThen he walked over to the guards that were glaring at him and sat\ndown. The implication was obvious.\nI’d rather be here.\nSteris closed her eyes, squeezing them shut, and tried to pretend she was\nsomeone other than herself for a time. Eventually, sounding bells\nannounced the arrival of constable carriages. She stood up and composed\nherself, relieved when Marasi exited one of them and hurried over.\n“Waxillium?” she asked.\nSteris shook her head.\n“Get in,” Marasi said, pointing to one of the carriages. “I’m sending you\nsomeplace safe.”\n“I think the danger has passed here,” Steris said. “Unless Wayne is\npicking fights again.”\n“No,” Marasi said. “The danger has only just started.”\nSomething in the younger woman’s tone gave Steris pause. Other\nconstables weren’t piling out of the carriages. In fact, they seemed to be\nwaiting for Marasi. They weren’t coming here to investigate the man\nWaxillium had chased off.\n“Something’s happened, hasn’t it?” Steris asked.\n“Yeah,” Marasi said. “Wayne, get over here! We’ve got work to do.”\n* * *\nWax stashed Lord Harms at the very top of Feder Tower. He’d chosen its\nlocation on the city map by picking random numbers; hopefully Bleeder\nwouldn’t be able to outthink a plan with no thought involved. Harms had\ninstructions to lie low, hide in the darkness and stay quiet. Even if Bleeder\ncould Steelpush and search in the night, the chance of her happening upon\nHarms was ridiculously low verging on impossible. That didn’t stop Wax\nfrom worrying. Steris’s father was a silly man, but good-natured and\namiable.\nIt was the best Wax could do, as he needed to locate the governor.

        "text": "thing. It meant that Drim, despite his dislike of Wax, was doing his job\nproperly. Best Wax could determine, they had sent at least three unmarked\ncarriages away from ZoBell Tower: two decoys, and one with the governor\ninside. He spotted one on Stanton Way, and dismissed it. Too obvious, with\nthe guards riding on top. Guessing that another had gone east, he found it\ndriving around in a circle in the Third Octant, also trying to draw attention.\nIt was moving too slowly.\nBesides, the governor wouldn’t go that way. Innate was a fighter. He\nwouldn’t want to be seen hiding. So it was that Wax found himself perched\non the top of a building near Hammond Promenade, a few streets from\nInnate’s own mansion. He’d return here, eschewing safehouses in the city.\nHe’d want to be in his center of power and authority.\nThe mists seemed to glow here in the city, lit by a thousand lights—an\nincreasing number of them electric. It took long enough for the carriage to\narrive that Wax was starting to second-guess himself. But arrive it did: a\ntall-topped enclosed coach with red curtains. Yes, it was quite nondescript.\nThe horses, however, were from the governor’s prized breeding stock. Just\nlike the two decoys.\nWax shook his head as he jumped and Pushed his way to the top of the\nstone archway outside the First Insurance Bank. The coach moved at a fair\nclip and held no obvious guards. They must have taken a very roundabout\nway to take so long to reach here. Wax leaped off the bank’s facade and\nPushed on a streetlight, hurling himself after the governor’s coach. He\nlanded on its top and nodded to the surprised coachman, then swung down\nalongside the vehicle and knocked on the coach’s door, hanging by one arm\nabove the blur of cobblestones beneath. They were certainly running the\nanimals hard.\nAfter a few moments the window shade opened, revealing Drim’s\nsurprised face. “Ladrian?” he said. “What the hell are you doing?”\n“Being polite,” Wax said. “May I come in?”\n“What if I refuse?”\n“Then I stop being polite.”\nDrim sneered, but glanced to the side, where the governor rode with his\nhat in his lap. The man nodded, and Drim sighed and turned back to the\ndoor.\nThey didn’t stop the carriage. So Wax had to let go, drop a bullet casing,\nand Push back to the carriage as Drim opened the door. He grabbed it by the\nhandle, Pushing off a passing light, and ducked into the vehicle, ending up\nseated opposite Drim and the governor.\nDrim would be a perfect person to imitate. As would the carriage driver,\nas would basically anyone with access to the governor, including his wife\nand family.\n“Lord Ladrian,” Innate said with a sigh. “Breaking up the party wasn’t\nenough for you? You have to harass me on the way home from it as well?”\nWax shrugged, then moved to climb back out of the carriage. He had the\ndoor half open before Innate, sputtering, snapped, “What are you doing\nnow, you fool?”"

He had the\ndoor half open before Innate, sputtering, snapped, “What are you doing\nnow, you fool?”\n“Leaving,” Wax said. “There are thousands of places I could be right\nnow, most of them more pleasant.” He hesitated, then pulled out one of his\nSterrions and flipped it in his hand, holding it grip-first to the governor.\n“Here.”\nThe governor’s eyes bulged. “Why would I need a gun? I have\nbodyguards.”\n“So did your brother,” Wax said. “Take it. I’ll feel guilty when you get\nshot, if I haven’t done something.”\n“… Shot?” Innate blanched. “My brother was killed because of his\nflirtations with the underbelly of Elendel. They wouldn’t dare touch me.”\n“I’m sure they wouldn’t,” Wax said, leaning out the door, then hesitated\nagain and looked back in. “You know how to spot a kandra, right, Drim?”\n“A what?” the thick-necked bodyguard said.\n“Those are myths,” Lord Innate said.\n“Are they?” Wax said. “Then the one I met tonight must have been\nlying. Not sure how she made her skin transparent though. Oh well. Guess\nyou have it in hand.”\n“You mean to tell me,” Innate said, stopping Wax with a touch before he\ncould move out the door again, “that one of the Faceless Immortals was at\nmy party tonight?”\n“Two, actually,” Wax said. “One came to help. I would introduce you,\nhave her prove her nature to you, but it does seem that your mind is made\nup. The other one at the party was the person who killed your brother. You\nsure you don’t want a gun? No? All right, I’ll just be—”\n“You’ve made your point, Lord Waxillium,” Innate said, sour-faced. He\nsettled back beside the carriage’s lantern, which burned gas with a proper\nlight.\n“My lord,” Drim said, looking to Innate. “This is stupid. The Faceless\nImmortals? Every second person claims to have met one, just to get their\nstories in the broadsheets! You’re not really considering these claims, are\nyou?”\nInnate studied Wax.\n“He is,” Wax said. “Because he knows something strange happened to\nhis brother. Killed in his saferoom, guards murdered from behind by\nsomeone they trusted—and Winsting Innate took his security very seriously.\nMore seriously than you do, I’d suspect, Mister Governor.”\n“You can introduce me to one of the creatures?” Innate asked. “Offer me\nproof of their existence?”\n“Yes.”\n“But why,” Drim said, “would one of Harmony’s own servants kill Lord\nWinsting?”\n“The kandra has gone insane,” Wax said softly. “We don’t know her\nmotives yet, but she does seem to want you dead, Mister Governor. So my\njob is to keep you alive.”\n“What do we do?” Innate asked. “How do we prepare?”\n“Well,” Wax said, “first I take over your security.”\n“Like hell you do!” Drim said.\n“You taking over is impossible,” Innate agreed. “Drim has served me\nwell for years. He … Where are you going?”"

He … Where are you going?”\nWax turned back from the door. “There’s a play I wanted to see\ntonight,” he said, gesturing. “Figured I’d go catch the tail end while you\ntwo discuss this.”\n“And if this creature comes for me while you’re gone?” Innate\ndemanded.\n“I’m sure your head of security can deal with it,” Wax said. “He knew\nthe kandra were at the party tonight, didn’t he? And he most certainly didn’t\nmiss Wayne slipping in wearing a disguise. And—”\n“You may review my security protocols,” Innate said with a sigh. “And\noffer advice.”\n“Fine,” Wax said, pulling the door closed as the carriage turned a corner\nand approached the governor’s mansion. “But you have to agree to one\nthing right now. I’m going to give you both a passphrase, and I want you\nboth to vow not to share it with anyone. Not even each other or Lady\nInnate. You’ll also give me a passphrase. When we meet, we’ll exchange\nthem in a whisper, which will prove that none of us have been replaced.”\n“You honestly think I wouldn’t know my own wife?” Innate asked\ntiredly.\n“I’m sure you would,” Wax said, softening his tone. “But this is a\nrequirement of my aid, and you must humor me. It will put my mind at\nease.”\nThe family was most dangerous. Bleeder had sounded so confident, as if\nshe had the governor in hand, which made Wax think the creature had\nalready gotten to one of the family. Lady Innate hadn’t been at the party, but\nHarmony had said Bleeder could swap bodies whenever she wished. Rust\nand Ruin, what an awful spot to be in. Bleeder could have killed a niece or\nnephew, a toddler even, and be planning to imitate one of them to get to the\ngovernor. In the Historica, kandra imitated animals. The house pets could\nsecretly be assassins.\nWax glanced at the governor, who looked profoundly disturbed, his\nhands clasped, eyes staring as if to see a thousand miles. The implications\nof it were sinking in. Innate wasn’t an idiot. Just an egotist and possibly a\ncrook.\nThe carriage pulled up to the mansion and Drim climbed out. As Wax\nfollowed, the governor took him by the arm. “I will want to see this proof of\nyours, Roughian.”\n“I’ll arrange a meeting tomorrow.”\n“Tonight.”\nWax nodded.\n“If this is true,” the governor said, still holding his arm, “what do we\ndo? I’ve read the Words of Founding. I know what the Immortals were\ncapable of. Ruin … this creature could be anyone. Passphrases won’t be\nenough. Not nearly.”\n“They won’t,” Wax admitted. “Sir, the thing has access to the Metallic\nArts too. At any time, she could be anything from a Pulser to an Archivist.\nThough she can only carry one at a time without risking loss of control, she\ncan swap the powers out at will.”\n“Great Harmony,” the governor whispered. “How do you stop\nsomething like that?”"

Bigger than you. She might\nnot want to bring you down until doing so topples the city government\nentirely.” Wax hesitated, then leaned closer. “Sir, you might want to leave\nElendel.”\n“Leave?” Innate said. “Have you seen what is going on in the city?”\nWax nodded. “I—”\n“Labor strikes,” Innate continued as if he hadn’t heard Wax. “Food\nprices skyrocketing. Too many men from one job out of work, too many\nfrom another demanding to be treated better. Rusts, there are practically\nriots in the streets, man! And the scandal. I can’t leave. My career would be\nover.”\n“Better than your life being over.”\nThe governor glanced at him. He didn’t seem to see it that way.\n“Leaving is impossible,” Innate reiterated. “It would look like I’m\nabandoning the people—they’d think the scandal drove me into hiding. I’d\nbe perceived as a coward. No. Impossible. I will send Lady Innate to safety,\nas well as the children. I must stay and you must deal with this thing,\nwhatever it is. Stop it before it can go any further.”\n“I’ll try,” Wax said, leaning in. “Give me a passphrase to authenticate\nmyself. Something memorable, but nonsensical.”\n“‘Leavening on sand.’”\n“Good. Mine for you is ‘bones without soup.’ You have a saferoom?”\n“Yes,” Innate said. “In the bottom of the mansion, beneath the sitting\nroom.”\n“Set up in there,” Wax said, climbing out of the carriage, “and if you\nlock the door, don’t let anyone in until I arrive, and can give you the\npassphrase.”\nSoon after stepping down, Wax found himself pulling out Vindication.\nHe’d leveled the gun before he registered what had set him off. Cries of\nalarm, but not pain. A servant hastened out of the governor’s mansion,\npassing pillars on the front lit stark white, like a line of femurs.\n“My lord governor!” the woman cried. “We’ve had a telenote through\nthe wire; something has happened. You’re going to need to prepare a\nresponse!”\n“What is it?” Wax demanded as the governor climbed from the carriage.\nThe servant hesitated, eyes widening at Wax’s gun. She wore a sharp\nblack suit, skirt to the ankles, red scarf at the neck. A steward, or perhaps\none of the governor’s advisors.\n“I’m a constable,” Wax said. “What is the emergency?”\n“A murder,” she said.\nHarmony, no … “Not Lord Harms. Please tell me!” Had he left the man\nto be killed, in his haste to get to the governor?\n“Lord who?” the woman asked. “It wasn’t a nobleman at all, constable.”"

She looked back\nto Wax. “It was Father Bin. The priest.”\n* * *\nMarasi stared up at the corpse, which had been nailed to the wall like an old\ndrapery. One spike through each eye. Blood painted the man’s cheeks and\nhad soaked into the white ceremonial robes, forming a crimson vest. Almost\nlike a Terris V. Blood stained the wall on either side of the corpse as well,\nsmeared there by thrashing arms and fingers. Marasi shivered. The priest\nhad been alive as this happened.\nThough constables poked and prodded at the large nave of the church,\nMarasi felt alone, standing before that corpse and its steel eyes. Just her and\nthe body, a disturbingly reverent scene. It reminded her of something out of\nthe Historica, though she couldn’t remember what.\nCaptain Aradel stepped up beside her. “I’ve had word of your sister,” he\nsaid. “We’ve got her in one of our most secure safehouses.”\n“Thank you, sir.”\n“What do you make of it?” he asked, nodding toward the body.\n“It’s ghastly, sir. What exactly happened?”\n“The conventicalists aren’t being very helpful,” he said. “I’m not sure if\nthey’re in shock, or if they see our intrusion here as offensive.”\nHe gestured for her to go before him and they passed Wayne, who sat in\none of the pews chewing gum and looking up at the body. Marasi and\nAradel exited the domed nave and entered a small foyer where a row of\nashen-faced people sat on some benches. They were conventicalists—those\nwho worked in a Survivorist church aside from the priest.\nA grey-haired woman sat at their head, wearing the formal dress of a\nchurch matron. She wiped her eyes, and several youths huddled against her,\neyes down. Constable Reddi stood nearby; the lean man tucked his\nclipboard under his arm and saluted Aradel. Normally, this wasn’t the sort\nof thing a constable-general would be involved in, but Aradel had been a\ndetective for many years.\n“Will you be handling the interrogation yourself, sir?” Reddi asked. The\nconventicalists stiffened visibly at the word “interrogation.” Marasi could\nhave smacked him for his tone.\n“No,” Aradel.\n“Very good, sir,” Reddi said, pulling his bow tie tight and taking out his\nclipboard. He stepped up to the conventicalists.\n“Actually,” Aradel said, “I was thinking we’d let Lieutenant Colms try.”\nMarasi felt a sharp spike of panic, which she smothered immediately.\nShe wasn’t afraid of a simple interrogation, particularly with amiable\nwitnesses. But the way Aradel said it, so seriously, made her suddenly feel\nas if it were some type of test.

The\nconstabulary has failed you this day.”\n“It’s not your fault,” the matron said, pulling one of the children tight.\n“Who could have anticipated … Holy Survivor, I knew those Pathians were\na miscreant bunch. I always knew it. No rules? No precepts to guide their\nlives?”\n“Chaos,” a shaven-headed man said from the bench behind. “They want\nnothing but chaos.”\n“What happened?” Marasi said. “I’ve read the report, of course, but …\nrusts … I can’t imagine…”\n“We were waiting for evening celebration,” the matron said. “The mists\nhad put in quite the appearance!

And then he just sauntered up to the dais, that\nPathian mongrel.”\n“Did you recognize him?”\n“Course I did,” the matron said. “It was that Larskpur; we see him at\ncommunity functions all the time. People feel they have to invite a Pathian\npriest, as if to not show favoritism, though nobody wants them around.”\nBehind her, the underpriest nodded. “Little wretch of a man, barely fit\nhis robes,” he said. “Nothing ornate. Really just a smock. They don’t even\ndress up to worship.”\n“He started talking to the crowd,” the matron continued. “Like he was\ngoing to give the mistdawn sermon! Only it was vile stuff he spouted.”\n“Such as what?” Marasi asked.\n“Blasphemy,” the matron said. “But it shouldn’t matter. Look here,\nconstable. Why are you even talking to us? A thousand people saw him.\nWhy are you treating us like we did something wrong? You should be off\narresting that monster.”\n“We have people hunting for him,” Marasi said, and rested her hand on\nthe shoulder of one of the children; the little girl whimpered and clamped\non to her arm. “And I promise you, we’ll catch and punish the one who did\nthis. But every detail you can remember will help us put him away.”\nThe matron and the underpriest glanced at each other. But it was one of\nthe others—a lanky altarman in his twenties—who spoke. “Larskpur said,”\nthe man whispered, “that the Survivor was a false god. That Kelsier had\ntried, and failed, to help humankind. That his death hadn’t been about\nprotecting us or Ascending, but about stupidity and bravado.”\n“It’s what they’ve always thought,” the matron said, “but don’t say.\nThose Pathians … they claim to accept everyone, but if you push you can\nsee the truth. They mock the Survivor.”\n“They want chaos,” the underpriest repeated. “They hate that so many\npeople look to the Survivor. They hate that we have standards. They have"

They have\nno meetings, no churches, no commandments.… The Path isn’t a religion,\nit’s a platitude.”\n“It stunned us, I’ll tell you that,” the matron said. “I thought at first that\nFather Bin must have invited Larskpur to speak. Why else would he be so\nbold as to step up to the pulpit? I was so horrified by what he said that I\ndidn’t notice the blood at first.”\n“I did,” the underpriest said. “I thought he was wearing gloves. I stared\nat those fingers, waving, bright red. And then I noticed the drops that he was\nflicking across the floor and the pulpit as he gestured.”\nThey all were quiet for a moment. “There isn’t anything more to say,”\nthe matron finally said. “Larskpur gestured one last time, and the back\ndraping fell down. There he was, our blessed father, nailed there in a\nterrible parody of the Survivor’s Statemark. Poor Father Bin had been …\nhanging the whole time. Might have been still alive, bleeding and dying\nwhile we all listened to that blasphemy.”\nMarasi doubted that. Though the priest had obviously struggled at first,\nthe spikes would have ended that quickly. “Thank you,” she said to the\ndistraught group. “You’ve been very helpful.” She carefully pried the little\ngirl’s hands from her arm and passed her to the matron.\nMarasi stood, walking to Aradel and Reddi, who stood on the other side\nof the room.\n“What do you think?” Marasi asked softly.\n“About the information,” Reddi said, “or your interrogation\ntechniques?”\n“Either.”\n“That wasn’t how I’d have done it,” the short constable said. “But I\nsuppose that you did put them at ease.”\n“They didn’t offer much,” Aradel said, rubbing at his chin.\n“What did you expect?” Marasi asked. “Captain, this had to be the same\nperson who killed Winsting.”\n“Don’t jump to conclusions,” Aradel said. “What would be the motive?”\n“Can you explain this any other way?” Marasi said, gesturing toward\nthe room with the dead priest. “A Pathian? Murdering? Sir, their priests are\nsome of least aggressive people on the planet. I’ve seen toddlers more\ndangerous.”\nAradel continued rubbing his chin. “Reddi,” he said, “go get those\nconventicalists something to drink. They could use a warm mug right now,\nI’d suspect.”\n“Sir?” Reddi said, taken aback.\n“You been spending so much time at the gun range you’ve gone deaf?”\nAradel said. “Be about it, Captain. I need to talk to Constable Colms.”\nReddi’s glare at Marasi could have boiled water, but he moved off to do\nas ordered.\n“Sir,” Marasi said, watching him go, “I can’t help noticing that you’re\ndetermined to see the rest of the constables hate me.”\n“Nonsense,” he said. “Just giving the boy a nudge.

He’s useless when he\nisn’t trying to show off for me—those weeks when he thought he had the\nassistant’s position sewn up were miserable. He’s a better officer when he\nhas somebody to compete with.” He took Marasi by the shoulder and\nsteered her away from the seated conventicalists. A junior corporal had just\nshown up with blankets and mugs of warm tea. Hopefully Reddi wouldn’t\nbe too put out at having that job stolen from him too.\n“I,” Aradel said, drawing her attention back to him, “can’t fight\nmistwraiths and spirits in the night. I’m a watchman, not an exorcist.”\n“I understand that, sir,” Marasi said. On their ride over here, she’d told\nhim what Waxillium had said about Bleeder. She wasn’t about to keep\ninformation like that from her superior. “But if the criminal is supernatural,\nwhat option do we have?”\n“I don’t know,” Aradel said, “and that frustrates me to no end. I’ve got a\ncity dry as a pile of autumn leaves, Lieutenant, and it’s about to go up in\nflames. I don’t have the manpower to hunt down a fallen immortal; I need\nto have constables on the streets trying to keep this city from consuming\nitself.”\n“Sir, what if the two are related?”\n“The two murders?”\n“The murders and the unrest, sir.” She closed her eyes, remembering the\nchapel with its dome and pews, and tried to imagine it as it had been earlier.\nLarskpur standing in front and waving his hands, horrified parishioners\nfleeing and bearing the story that the Pathian leader had murdered a\nSurvivorist priest …\n“Bleeder, or whoever is behind this, has distracted the government with\na scandal,” Marasi said opening her eyes. “Now she strikes at one church\nleader in the guise of another? Sir, whatever her real motives are, she’s\nobviously trying to strain Elendel. She wants this city to break.”\n“You might be ascribing too much to one person, Lieutenant.”\n“Not just a person,” Marasi said. “A demigod. Sir, what started the\nworker strikes?”\n“Hell if I know,” Aradel said, patting at his pocket and taking out his\ncigar case. He opened it and found only a little folded note. He grimaced\nand showed it to her. There’s a banana in your drawer. “Damn woman will\nbe the death of me. Anyway, I suspect the strikes have been building for a\nwhile. Harmony knows I sympathize with the poor fools. Get paid like dirt\nwhile the house lords live in mansions and penthouses.”\n“But why now?” Marasi asked. “It’s the food, right? Suddenly spiked\nprices, worry that even when the strikes end, there won’t be food to be\nbought?”\n“That certainly hasn’t helped,” Aradel agreed. “Those floods are going\nto be a strain.”\n“A broken dam. Did we investigate that properly?”\nAradel paused, little paper half folded to return to his pocket. “You think\nthat could have been sabotage?”\n“Could be worth checking,” Marasi said."

Did we investigate that properly?”\nAradel paused, little paper half folded to return to his pocket. “You think\nthat could have been sabotage?”\n“Could be worth checking,” Marasi said.\n“Could be indeed,” Aradel said. “I’ll see if I can spare some men. But if\nyou’re right, what’s this creature’s endgame?”\n“General mayhem?” Marasi asked.\nAradel shook his head. “Maybe it’s different for mistwraiths, but men\nwho do things like this, they do it to prove something. They want to show\nhow clever they are, or they want to stop an injustice. Maybe she wants to\nbring someone down. Isn’t the governor a Pathian?”\n“I think so.”\n“So this murder tonight could be an attempt to discredit his religion.”\nAradel nodded. “Kill his brother, expose a scandal, undermine his faith,\ncause riots during his tenure … Rusts, this could be about making sure that\nInnate doesn’t just die, he gets stomped to the ground.”\nMarasi nodded slowly. “Sir. I … might have proof that the governor is\ncorrupt.”\n“What? What kind of proof?”\n“Nothing definitive,” she said, blushing. “It has to do with his policies,\nand when he’s changed his mind on bills, when he’s voted irregularly\nfollowing visits with certain key individuals. Sir, you said you hired me in\npart because of my ability to read statistics. I’ll show you what I have once\nit’s all arranged, but the story the governor’s record tells is of a man who is\noffering himself up for sale.”\nAradel ran a hand through his hair, red flecked with grey. “Harmony.\nKeep this quiet, Lieutenant. We’ll worry about it another time.\nUnderstand?”\n“Yes, sir. And I agree.”\n“But good work,” he noted, then jogged over to take crime scene\nreports. Marasi couldn’t help feeling a thrill that he’d listened to what she\nsaid, even when all she could offer was half explanations. At the same time,\nhowever, a disturbing thought struck her. What if Aradel was secretly the\nkandra, somehow? How much damage could Bleeder do if she had an entire\noctant’s constables under her thumb?\nNo. Aradel had been around people when the priest was murdered.\nRusts … the creature would have Marasi jumping at shadows, wondering if\neveryone she met was a kandra. She went to get herself a cup of that tea,\nhoping it would help her banish the image in her head of poor Father Bin\nhung from the wall. She wasn’t halfway to the table with the flasks before\nthe doors to the foyer slammed open and Waxillium strode in.\nHe trailed tassels like the curling mists, his powerful stride prompting\nlesser constables to scuttle out of his way. How was it that he could so fully\nencapsulate everything the constables should be, but weren’t? Noble\nwithout being pandering, thoughtful yet proactive, unyielding yet\ninquisitive.\nMarasi smiled, then hurried after him. It wasn’t until they reached the\nchapel, with its large glass dome and the dead priest hanging on the far side,\nthat she realized she’d forgotten entirely about getting tea. A headache still\nthumped inside her skull."

A headache still\nthumped inside her skull.\nAradel stood inside the nave, accompanied by two young constables.\n“Lord Ladrian,” he said, turning toward Waxillium. “We’ll have a report on\nthe body ready for you in—”\n“I’ll see for myself, constable,” Waxillium said. “Thank you.” He\ndropped a bullet casing and rose into the air, soaring over rows of pews\nbeneath the dome to land on the dais.\nAradel sighed and muttered a curse under his breath, then turned to one\nof the corporals. “See that His Lordship gets whatever he needs. Maybe he\ncan make something of this damn mess—assuming he doesn’t just shoot the\nplace up instead.”\nThe young constable nodded, then ran to join Waxillium, who was\nsaying something to Wayne, who had stepped up to join him. Whatever\nWaxillium said sent the shorter man scuttling out the doors on some errand.\nThe constable-general shook his head, a sour grimace on his lips.\n“Sir?” Marasi said. “You’re upset with Lord Waxillium?”\nAradel started, as if he hadn’t seen—or hadn’t registered—her standing\nthere. “Pay no heed, Lieutenant. His Lordship is a great resource to this\ndepartment.”\n“Sir, that has the sound of a practiced answer to it.”\n“Good,” Aradel said, “because it took me a long time to learn to say it\nwithout cursing.”\n“Could I have the non-practiced version?”\nAradel looked her over. “Let’s just say that it must be damn nice,\nLieutenant, to have other people to clean up your messes for you.” He\nnodded to her, then stalked from the room.\nRusts. Was that how Aradel saw Waxillium? A rogue nobleman\naccustomed to getting what he wanted, blunt in ways that Aradel could\nnever be? The constable-general wasn’t a nobleman, and had to worry about\nfunding, politics, the future of his men. Waxillium could just butt in and do\nwhat he liked, shooting and letting his status—both as an Allomancer and a\nhouse lord—get him out of it.\nThat perspective was eye-opening. Waxillium was a trouble. A\nworthwhile trouble, as he did get things done, but almost as bad as the\nproblems he solved. But for that brief moment he seemed less an ally and\nmore a storm that you had to prepare for and clean up after.\nDisturbed, she walked up through the room to join him beside the body.\n“Those spikes give off strong lines,” Waxillium noted to her, pointing at\nFather Bin’s ruined face. “To my Allomantic senses, I mean. From what\nI’ve read, I think that means they’re not Hemalurgic spikes. Those are\nsupposed to be tough to see and Push on, like metalminds.”\n“What would spiking him accomplish?” Marasi asked.\n“No idea,” Waxillium said. “Still, when you get that body down, send\nme a sample of metal from each spike. I want to run some tests on their\ncomposition.”\n“All right,” Marasi said."

I want to run some tests on their\ncomposition.”\n“All right,” Marasi said.\n“We should have seen it. She’s trying to drive a wedge between the\nPathians and the Survivorists.”\n“The governor is Pathian,” Marasi said. “We think Bleeder is trying to\nget at him.”\n“You’re right,” Waxillium said, narrowing his eyes. “But that’s not her\ntrue goal. She wants to overthrow the city. Perhaps the governor’s murder\nwill be the capstone. But what does this have to do with me?”\n“Everything doesn’t have to be about you, you know.”\n“Not everything,” Waxillium agreed. “Just this.”\nAnnoyingly, he was probably right. Why else would Bleeder be\nparading around the city wearing the body of the man who had killed\nWaxillium’s wife? Waxillium left the corpse, pushing out of the building\nthough the rear exit. There a narrow alleyway led out to the street. Marasi\nfollowed, joining Waxillium in the darkness and mists.\n“What are you doing?” she asked.\n“You don’t plan a dramatic murder like this one without preparing an\nescape route,” Waxillium said. “From the discarded handkerchiefs and\nhandbags left behind, I’d guess the room was full when she revealed the\nbody. The worshippers ran out the main doors, and the murderer would\nhave expected this. She would have come out the back, getting away while\neveryone was either fleeing or stunned.”\n“Okay…”\n“Narrow alley,” Waxillium said, kneeling to inspect the wall. “Look at\nthis.”\nMarasi squinted. The bricks along the wall here had been scraped,\nleaving behind something that had rubbed off on them. “Looks metallic.\nSilvery.”\n“Paint, I’d guess,” Waxillium said. “Where it came from is a small\nquestion, unfortunately, compared to the larger ones. Why would she kill\nthis priest in the first place? She warned me she was going to. I thought she\nmeant your father. Not Father Bin.”\n“Waxillium,” Marasi said. “We need more information. About what this\ncreature can do, and what its motives might be.”\n“Agreed,” Waxillium said. He rose and stared down the alleyway. “I’d\nlike to ask God a few hard questions. I doubt He’s going to make Himself\navailable, however, so we’ll have to settle for someone else.”\n“Who?” Marasi asked.\n“I had some help tonight,” Waxillium said. “From an unexpected\nsource. I have a feeling that an interview with her will be illuminating. Want\nto come?”\n“Of course I do,” Marasi said. “Why wouldn’t I?”\n“Well,” Waxillium said, “I’m worried that interacting with her might\nprove … theologically difficult.”\n13\nWayne didn’t consider himself to be a particularly religious man. He figured\nthat Harmony didn’t pay much attention to fellows like him, for the same\nreason a master painter didn’t often wonder what his mom had done with\nthe pictures he’d given her as a toddler.\nThat said, Wayne did like to visit the temple of the common man now"

It made him feel better and forget his problems for a spell. So he\nknew the place when Wax sent him on ahead to check it over.\nThe temple huddled on the corner of an intersection, a stately old\nbuilding, squat and stubborn. Newer tenements perched on either side, some\nsix stories tall, but the temple had the air of an old gaffer in his chair who\nhadn’t the inclination to look higher than a fellow’s knees. As Wayne had\nexpected, the door was open and friendly, still spilling out light, though it\nwas starting to get late. He strolled down the lane and nodded to the temple\nguard, who wore a cap and overalls for his uniform and bore a ceremonial\nstick what seemed to have bits of hair sticking out of the end, likely from\nclubbing men upside the head for being too rowdy.\nWayne tipped his hat to the man and chanted the proper invocation to\ngain admittance. “Hello, Blue. How watery’s the beer today?”\n“Don’t make trouble at the pub tonight, Wayne,” the man intoned in\nresponse. “My temper is really short.”\n“Temper?” Wayne said, passing him. “That’s a funny name for it, mate,\nbut if the ladies like you givin’ silly names to your body parts, I ain’t gonna\nsay nothin’.”\nRitual introductions finished, Wayne stepped into the temple proper.\nInside, men and women bowed at their places, heads drooping as they\nconsidered the deep complexities of the cosmere. Their prayers were made\nin mumbled exchanges to friends, and their incense in the burning of pipes.\nA picture of Old Ladrian himself hung over the altar, a man with a ripe\npaunch and a cup thrust forward, as if to demand attention.\nWayne stood in the doorway, head bowed in respect, and dabbed his\nfingers into a trail of beer dripping from a nearby table, then anointed\nhimself on the forehead and navel, the mark of the spear.\nThe scent marked him as a pilgrim upon this holy ground, and he passed\namong the penitent seeking forgiveness on his way to the altar. The air of\nthe place was odd tonight. Solemn. Yes, the temple was a place of\ncontemplation, but it should also be a place of joy. Where were the hymns,\nsung in a holy slur? Where was the laughter, the joyful noise of celebration?\nNot good, he thought as he settled onto one of the pews—in this case a\nrough, circular table with scriptures carved into it, like Mic is a total git and\nThe sausages is rubbish. He’d always liked that one. It brought up real\ntheological implications, it did. If the food they ate was trash, were they\nultimately trash? Were they all nothing in the end? Or should one instead\nsee even trash as something to be elevated, as it had been created by the\nGod Beyond like everything else?\nWayne settled back in his seat and drew a few looks from nearby tables.\nAs a lovely young conventicalist in a plunging top passed by carrying"

Those nearby\nignored him. Wayne closed his eyes and listened to their prayers.\n“They’re just gonna let us starve. You heard the governor, Ren. All he\ncares about is his rusting reputation.”\n“We’re supposed to have the good life. Harmony made this land for us\nall. But do we get to enjoy it? No. Its riches only mean that the fine folk get\nmore outfits and big houses.”\n“Something needs to change in this city. I ain’t out of work like those\nfellows at the steel mill, but Harmony…”\n“Sixteen-hour shifts. I leave before my little girl gets up, and she’s in\nbed before I get back. See her once a week, I do.”\n“We work and die so we can give it all up to the same people. They own\nthe building we live in. Ain’t that the scam? Work for them all day, then\ngive it all back at night for the privilege of bein’ able to survive another day\nto keep workin’.”\nWeighty prayers, those were.\nWayne kicked back away from his table and walked to the altar at the\nfront of the room, with its bottles on the rack behind shining in the light.\nGas lights. Real traditional, this temple was. He settled down at the altar\nbetween a fellow with suspenders and another with arms so hairy he had to\nhave some bear in him. Grandfather, at least.\n“Whhiskey,” Wayne said to the priest behind the altar.\nThe man gave him a cup of water with a lemon in it instead. Rusts.\nMight have laid the accent on a little too thick. Wayne settled back, sipping\nhis water.\nThe men here at the altar, they didn’t complain. They just stared,\nholding their cups. Wayne nodded. Those were silent prayers, the kind that\nyou could read in their eyes. He reached out and plucked the cup from the\nnext man’s hands and gave it a sniff. Plain rum. What fun was that?\nHe reached over to bear-fur and plucked his drink from his fingers as\nwell, and gave it a sniff. Both men turned toward him as he downed the rest\nof his water, then mixed their drinks together in his cup. He gave it a\nsqueeze of his lemon and a pinch of sugar from behind the altar, then added\nsome ice, placed a coaster on top, and shook like his life depended on it.\nWhich it might, since the fellow with rugs on his arms had just stood up and\ncracked his knuckles.\nBefore he could start pounding, Wayne spun a cup toward each man and\nsettled back in thought. The cups settled into place, and the altar fell silent.\nHesitant, the men reached out and tried their drinks. Suspenders tried his\nfirst.\n“Wow,” the man said. “What did you do?”\nWayne didn’t reply, tapping the table with one finger as hairy-arms tried"

Living among the fancy folk had\ntaught Wayne a few things. Fancy folk couldn’t ever do anything the\nordinary way. Sometimes he thought they acted strange just so they\nwouldn’t be like regular folk.\nBut they did know how to get drunk. He’d give them that.\nThe priest came over to investigate the disturbance, but both men just\nwanted more of what Wayne had made. The priest listened to them try to\nexplain it, and then nodded—looked like he’d worked some fancy parties,\nor had some rich folk come in.\nWayne slipped something onto the altar. A couple of bullet casings.\n“What’s this?” the priest asked, setting down the cup he’d been wiping.\n“Is this … is this aluminum?”\nWayne stood up and gathered a few things from behind the altar, then\npiled them in the priest’s arms. He had ice, fortunately, from a delivery\nearlier. That was getting cheaper and cheaper these days, with shipments\ndown from the mountains. The fellow also had a nice collection of spirits\nand some fixings. Enough for Wayne to make do.\nWayne pointed for the man to follow him, then began working his way\nthrough the room. He stopped at each table, taking their drinks and\nreworking them. Those with beer got juice or soda water, mixed carefully\nand transformed. He always left them with something like what they’d\nstarted with, but new. Fresh. He added ginger to some—worked real nice\nwith lemon—and bitters to others. He tried to use something from every\ntable, and only got cussed at a couple of times. Before too long, he had the\ntemple feeling far more companionable. In fact, he’d drawn something of a\ncrowd.\nThe group cheered as he settled down at a table in front of a tall, pretty\nwoman with large eyes and long fingers. The drink he made for her wasn’t\nactually anything special—gin and lime, with some soda water and a hint of\nsugar—but the secret ingredient … well, that was something special. A\npouch of blue powder he’d found at the party earlier that night. He’d traded\nsome sand for it.\nHe mixed the powder into the drink with a hidden twist of the fingers,\nshaking, before finally adding the lime. As he slid the cup in front of the\nwoman, the drink’s blue liquid swirled and moved, then blushed to a deep\nviolet, the color moving through it like growing mists.\nThose around him hushed in awe, and the woman smiled at him. He\ngave her a grin back. He was taken, yes, but he needed to keep practicing\nhis flirtin’ or Ranette was likely to start ignoring him.\nAnd then the skin of the woman’s cheeks shifted to blue, then violet, just\nlike the drink had. Wayne jumped back from the table as her skin returned\nto normal. She took the drink with a sly smile and sipped at it. “Nice,” she\nsaid, “but I usually like something with more kick to it.”\nThe others in the temple were retreating to their pews. They’d enjoyed\nthe show, but were looking forward to enjoying their liquor even more."

You’re some kinda demigod or\nsomething. Shouldn’t you be moralizin’ at me?”\n“Lo, behold,” MeLaan said, wiggling her cup, “bring an offering to your\ndeity in the form of one blue sunset, extra gin. And ye shall be blessed.”\n“I think I can do that,” Wayne said. “Bloody hell, maybe I am religious\nafter all.”\n* * *\nThe immortal demigod took a throaty slurp of her beer, then slammed the\nmug down onto the table, grinning like a four-year-old who had been paid\nin cookies to rat out her sister. Wax studied her as she looked Wayne in the\neyes and let out a belch that could have woken the dead. Beside Wax,\nWayne nodded in appreciation, looking quite impressed. He then downed\nhis own beer and belched back at MeLaan, easily twice as long and loud.\n“How do you do that?” MeLaan asked.\n“Years of trainin’ and practice,” Wayne said.\n“I’ve been alive for well over half a millennium,” MeLaan said. “I am\ncertain I have more practice than you.”\n“You don’t have the will, though,” Wayne said, wagging his finger. “You\ngotta want it.” He downed the rest of his mug and let out a protracted belch.\nMarasi, who sat next to Wax in their booth at the pub, looked horrified\nby the exchange.

He could barely feel the hit.\nAfter the short ride, he and Marasi had walked in on these two in the\nmiddle of their belching … contest? Wax wasn’t certain if it was a contest,\nor more a matter of mutual appreciation, like two virtuosos playing their\nfavorite songs.\nMeLaan finished her beer, then dramatically held up her hand. The palm\nsplit, forming lips, which then let out a soft belch.\n“Cheating,” Wayne said.\n“Just using what Father gave me,” MeLaan said. “Don’t tell me you\nwouldn’t belch out of other body parts if you could.”\n“Well,” Wayne said, “now that you mention it, I can make a real\ninterestin’ sound wif—”\nWax cleared his throat. “Not to defer a conversation about which parts\nof Wayne’s body can and can’t make noise, but I have to admit that you\naren’t what I expected, Your Grace.”\n“Bloody hell,” MeLaan said. “Please don’t call me that.”\n“You’re a servant of Harmony,” Wax said.\n“I’m from one of the later generations,” MeLaan said. “In kandra terms,\nI’m basically still a kid.”\n“You lived through the Catacendre,” Wax said. “You knew the\nOriginators.”\n“I spent the Catacendre underground,” MeLaan said. “I was an\nadolescent, and didn’t know the land when it was covered in ash. You really\ndon’t need to be intimidated by me.”\n“You’re over six hundred years old,” Marasi said.\n“So is dirt,” MeLaan said. She leaned forward. “Look, I’m just here to\nhelp. If you want someone to fawn over, I’ll send VenDell or one of the\nreally ancient ones to you. They like it. I just want to see Paalm stopped,\nthen helped.”\nWax leaned forward on the table. He could sense in the way MeLaan\nsmiled at people passing by—the way she tapped her finger to the tavern\nsong a group of drunk men sang in the corner—that she liked people. She\nliked being here, among them. She wasn’t aloof, as he’d expected, or\nwithdrawn. Not even that alien, despite the fact that she’d just made a\nmouth in her hand. “You’re the one who brought me my earring,” he said,\nfingering his ear with its tiny spike. “All those years ago.”\nMeLaan’s smile widened. “I was wearing the same body, but I’m still\nsurprised you remember.”\n“And whose body is it?” Marasi asked. “Where did you get those\nbones?”\n“I made them,” MeLaan said, raising her chin. Her face went\ntransparent, suddenly, revealing the skull underneath—one made of carved\ncrystal of a vivid emerald color. “I prefer True Bodies, though if I need to I\ncan take another form. I’ll warn you, as far as kandra go, I’m only so-so at\nimpersonation.”\n“And this one we’re huntin’?” Wayne asked. He’d started building a"

He’d started building a\nhouselike tower using the thin wooden coasters strewn around the tavern\ntable, balancing them on their ends.\n“Paalm?” MeLaan said, turning her face back to normal. “She was one\nof our best. Of all the kandra I know, only TenSoon is better at it than she\nis.”\n“But she’ll be erratic,” Wax said. “She’s gone mad. That should help us\nspot her, even in disguise, right?”\n“Maybe,” MeLaan said, grimacing. She took a few of the coasters and\nstarted her own tower. “Paalm is good, and imitation … well, it’s kind of\ningrained in us, particularly the older kandra who worked back in the days\nof the Final Empire. Some of them don’t feel like they have personalities of\ntheir own; they don’t know how to live unless they’re being someone else.”\n“You seem to find the idea disturbing,” Wax said, curious.\n“I’m a youngster,” she said with a shrug. “Never really had to serve the\nLord Ruler. I’ve always served Harmony, who seems like a generally nice\nfellow.”\nAn odd way to refer to God. Wax glanced at Marasi, who cocked an\neyebrow at him and shrugged. Around them, the pubgoers chattered with a\nlow hum of energy and enthusiasm. Wax and the others had settled into a\nsecluded booth at the side. The warm gas lighting was somehow friendlier,\nmore alive than the electric lights back at his mansion.\n“All right,” Wax said to MeLaan. “Let’s talk about what Bleeder can do.\nAnd about how to kill her.”\n“You don’t need to kill her,” MeLaan said quickly, getting her tower to a\nsecond story. She glanced at Wayne, who already had his up to three levels.\n“Just remove her remaining spike, which will basically immobilize her.\nShe’s confused; we can deal with her once we have her in custody.”\n“Confused?” Wax said. “She killed a priest by nailing him through the\neyes.”\nMeLaan’s smile faded. “She only has one spike. She’s not thinking\nstraight.”\n“Yes,” Wax said, “but she pulled the other spike out herself, right?”\n“We think so,” MeLaan admitted. “We’re weaker than other Hemalurgic\ncreatures. Only two spikes, and we can be taken. So she removed one.”\n“She wanted freedom to kill,” Wax said. “She’s not ‘confused,’ MeLaan.\nShe’s destructive and possibly psychotic. Tell me how to kill her.”\nMeLaan sighed. “Acid works, but that’s horribly inefficient. If you crush\nher skeleton, she’ll have a hard time moving, so maybe use that. Gunshots\nwill be useless, as will most forms of physical damage. The spike—it’s the\nkey. Pull it out, and she’ll revert to her primal state. It is the best way.”\n“Her primal state,” Marasi said. “A mistwraith.”\nMeLaan nodded.\nWax tapped the table in thought. “If I can get the spike out, chances are"

If she’s tied up, what good will it do to\nremove the spike?”\n“Waxillium,” MeLaan said, leaning forward, “you do realize what\nyou’re dealing with? Paalm was trained by the ancients, and served the\nLord Ruler himself. She quashed rebellions and overthrew kingdoms in his\nservice, and she is intimately familiar with the intricacies of Hemalurgy. By\nyour own accounts, she’s learned to use spikes to grant herself Allomancy\nand Feruchemy—something we thought impossible. If you have her\ncaptured, that is a state she’s not likely to remain in for long. Remove that\nspike.”\nWax felt a chill. “Right,” he said. “Will do.”\n“Rusts,” Marasi whispered. “I thought you didn’t want us to be\nintimidated by you.”\n“Me?” the kandra said. “I’m harmless.” She waved at the barmaid, then\npointed at her mug. “I’m far less crazy than Paalm.”\n“Great,” Wax said. He glanced at Wayne. “You look concerned.”\n“Me?” Wayne said, placing a fourth level onto his tower. “Sorry. Tryin’\nto think of how to get everyone in the city drunk.”\n“I … I’m not going to ask.” Wax grabbed a few of the coasters as a\nbarmaid dropped more on the table, noticing that they were playing with\nthem. He started building a tower of his own. “So we get the spike out.\nHow?”\n“Easiest way is to call me,” MeLaan said. “I can get it out. But if I’m\nnot there, don’t wait on me. Break her bones, start pulling them out, and\neventually you’ll find the spike. It will take a strong stomach.”\nGreat. “Is there a way to spot a kandra? Wound patterns? Blood\nsamples?”\nMeLaan dug into her pocket. “Once we’ve shifted shapes, we lock into\nthat body and are that person. We’ll bleed, and if you take off a finger, our\nprints will remain that of the person we’re imitating. Even another kandra\nwill have trouble spotting a duplicate. Haven’t you read the Historica?”\n“Several times,” Wax said, “but the kandra sections are kind of dull.”\n“I feel like I should be offended by that.”\n“Then you aren’t drunk enough,” Wayne responded. Five levels. Wax\nshook his head and concentrated on getting his second level built.\n“Anyway,” MeLaan said, “locating other kandra was a problem in the\npast. So we did something about it, just in case. The more scientifically\nminded among us developed this.”\nShe slid something onto the table. A pair of needles, about as long as a\nman’s palm is wide, attached to metal syringes. Wax held one up.\n“Inject that into a kandra,” MeLaan said, “and the liquid inside will\nmake her shape droop for a bit. The skin briefly goes clear, reveals who she\nreally is.”\n“Nifty,” Wayne said."

The skin briefly goes clear, reveals who she\nreally is.”\n“Nifty,” Wayne said.\n“One problem though,” MeLaan said. “If you stick it into someone who\nisn’t a kandra, it will kill them.”\n“Inconvenient,” Marasi said, examining the other one.\n“Yeah,” MeLaan said. “We’re working on that part. This is a last resort,\nobviously, but it will immobilize her briefly. If you want to find Paalm\nbefore using it, you can try to catch her in a lie. She won’t have the actual\nmemories of the person she’s imitating. Conversely, if you see someone\nwho isn’t Metalborn use a power, that outs her too.”\n“I’ve got a feeling that if she’s using her powers right in front of me,\nI’m dead anyway,” Wax said.\nThe group fell silent. Wax took both syringes and tucked them into the\npouch on his gunbelt. Marasi scribbled on a note pad, transcribing the\nconversation—he’d have to ask her for a copy. Drink refills arrived, and no\npayment was requested. What had Wayne done here before Wax arrived?\nHe was afraid to ask.\nWhat help is this? Wax thought, frustrated, his tower falling to pieces. A\nweapon he could use only when he was already a hundred percent certain\nwho the impostor was? It felt like so little. Bleeder could be anyone.\nBleeder could manifest any of the powers. Bleeder was ancient, brilliant,\nand crafty.…\n“She has a plan,” Wax said. “She’s not simply crazy, MeLaan. There is\nmore to this.”\n“You’re still determined to kill her,” MeLaan said, sighing.\n“If I have to. Why are you so hesitant? I’d think that the kandra would\nbe determined, more than anyone, to see this problem dealt with.”\n“She’s not a ‘problem,’” MeLaan said. “She’s a person. Yes, I want to\nsee her stopped. She needs to be stopped. But…” She settled back, then\nknocked over her small tower of coasters with a flick of the finger. “There’s\nso few of us left. Hell, there weren’t ever more than five or six hundred of\nus, and we lost a lot in the days before the Final Ascension. Imagine if your\nentire race consisted of three hundred people, lawman. Maybe you’d be a\nlittle more hesitant to see one of them slagged.”\n“A person’s species shouldn’t matter,” Wax snapped. “I don’t care if\nthere are three hundred of you left or just three; when one of you starts\nnailing people to walls in my city, I’m going to—”\n“Wax,” Wayne interrupted, balancing his sixth story of beer-mat\ncoasters. “Check your pulse, mate.”\nWax took a deep breath. “Sorry,” he said.\n“What was that,” Marasi said, wagging her pencil from Wayne to Wax.\n“Pulse?”\n“Sometimes,” Wayne said, “Wax forgets he’s a person and starts\nthinkin’ he’s a rock instead.”\n“It’s Wayne speak,” Wax said, grabbing some coasters and starting\nanother tower. “For times when he thinks I should be a little more\nempathetic.”\n“You can be single-minded, mate.”"

He picked up his\nsculpture, knocking down the top levels, but revealing that the bottom three\nhad—indeed—been stuck together.\n“Wayne,” Marasi said, aghast. “Are you that concerned with impressing\nus?”\n“It wasn’t about impressing anyone,” Wax said. “The contest wasn’t\nabout how high the towers got—it was about if I’d spot what he did. He\nalways cheats somehow. Back to the matter at hand, MeLaan. Your rogue\nkandra friend is planning something. If her plot gains momentum, it will\nroll over us and crush this city.”\n“I agree,” MeLaan said. “So what do we do?”\n“We outthink her,” Wax said. “I need to know her motive. Why is she\ndoing this? What drove her to pull out her spike in the first place?”\n“I wish I knew,” MeLaan said. “We’ve been trying to figure out the\nsame thing.”\n“Tell me about her, then,” Wax said, tapping at his empty shot glass.\n“What is she like? What are her passions?”\n“Paalm was the ultimate blank slate,” MeLaan said. “Old-style kandra.\nLike I said, she spent so much time out on missions that she barely had a\npersonality of her own. She had real trouble with that at the dawn of a new\nworld. Some of the older generations, they liked to spend time in the\nHomeland, only left for a mission when forced to. Not Paalm. She was the\nFather’s own, the kandra reserved specifically to do missions for the Lord\nRuler.” She hesitated. “She might know things from him. Things the rest of\nus weren’t told. I think he may even have had her imitate Inquisitors at\ntimes, act as a mole among them.\n“Anyway, she wouldn’t have been able to impersonate an Inquisitor\nwithout a good grasp of Allomancy and Feruchemy. So maybe that’s where\nshe got the knowledge. She was loyal to the Lord Ruler, and then when he\nwas gone, she became loyal to Harmony. Fanatical about it. Insisted on\nbeing given mission after mission, and never spent time with the rest of us."

She was almost always in character. Until…”\n“Murderous rampage,” Wayne said softly. “It’s always the quiet ones.\nWell, and the psychopathic ones. That too.”\nSo what does that tell me? Wax thought, leaving his little tower at three\nstories. How would I approach this if it were any other criminal?\nMeLaan leaned back for a moment, as if lost in thought, then flipped a\ncoaster at Wax’s tower to knock it down. She grunted.\n“What?” Wax said.\n“I was just curious to see if you were cheating too.”\n“Wax never cheats,” Wayne said, face halfway in his mug. Wax had\nnever figured out how he could talk and drink at the same time without\nchoking.\n“That’s incorrect,” Wax said. “I cheat infrequently. That way nobody’s\nexpecting it.” He stood up. “Can you think of a reason Bleeder would target\nthe governor in particular?”\nMeLaan shook her head.\n“Do any of the other kandra know her better than you do?”\n“Maybe one of the older ones,” MeLaan said. “I’ll see if I can get one of\nthem to come talk to you.”\n“Good,” Wax said. “But first I want you three watching the governor.”\n“I’ve got to report in to the precinct offices first,” Marasi said. “I want to\nfollow up on something there.”\n“Fine,” Wax said. “Wayne, you head to the governor’s mansion first.”\n“He ditched me last time.”\n“He won’t again,” Wax said. “I’ve persuaded him to listen, though we’ll\nneed him to meet MeLaan soon.”\n“Sure, all right,” Wayne said. “It wasn’t like I was planning to, you\nknow, sleep tonight or anythin’.”\n“Sleep might be in short supply going forward,” Wax said.\n“You want me to go with him, Dawnshot?” MeLaan asked.\n“Depends. Marasi, would you like some backup?”\n“Yes please,” she said.\n“Watch her,” Wax said, nodding toward Marasi. “And maybe give\nAradel a glimpse of your nature. It’s probably time to inform him what\nwe’re up against.”\n“Already done,” Marasi said. “Though I’m sure he’d like proof.”\nWax grunted. He hadn’t ordered her to do that. “Be quick about your\nerrand,” Wax told her. “And get to the governor. I want more than one set of\neyes on him. And before we split, I want each pair of us to exchange codes,\nindividual and unknown to the others, so we each have a way to\nauthenticate ourselves to one another. I’ve done the same with the governor\nand his top staff.” Harmony, this was going to be a nightmare.\n“Watching the governor isn’t going to be enough, Wax,” Marasi said,\nstanding up from the table. “You yourself said it. Too reactive. So what else\nare we going to do?”\n“I’ll come up with something.”\nThe others stood, and Wax towed Wayne by the arm to check to see that\nthey were square with the pub manager.

Surprisingly, Wayne had indeed\npaid for everything he should have. On their way toward the door, Wax\nexplained to his friend a little idea he had for protecting the governor.\nThey stepped into the entryway of the pub, where MeLaan was waiting\nwhile Marasi fired up her beast of a motorcar. Wayne hiked off to catch a\ncarriage to take him to the governor’s mansion, and Wax took MeLaan by\nthe arm.\n“I hate this,” he noted, soft enough to keep the bouncer outside from\nhearing. “Not being able to trust people I should always be able to. Second-\nguessing myself.”\n“Yeah,” she replied. “But you’ll handle it. There’s a reason He came to\nyou for this.” She stepped in closer. Rusts, she was attractive—but then, it\nwould be odd if she weren’t, all things considered. “You and I aren’t the\nonly ones hunting Paalm, lawman—every kandra in the city is searching for\nher. Thing is, I don’t think many of my brothers and sisters will be of use.\nThey’re timid about hurting others, particularly after what TenSoon was\nforced to do during the Remarked Duplicity. And beyond that, they can be\nan … inconsistent group.”\n“They’re God’s servants,” Wax said.\n“Yes,” MeLaan replied, “and they’ve had centuries upon centuries to\nrefine their eccentricities. Getting older does not tend to make you more\nnormal, let me tell you. We don’t think like killers. We’ve been too closely\nin contact with Harmony. What Paalm is doing, it baffles us. It goes against\neverything we’ve believed and lived for centuries. I don’t think we’ll be\nable to find her, not in time. But you … you can.”\n“Because I think like a killer.”\n“I didn’t—”\n“It’s all right,” Wax said, releasing her arm. “I am what I am.” He took\nhis mistcoat from the peg by the door and shrugged it on before stepping\nout into the night. “Thanks, by the way,” he said.\n“For?”\nHe tapped his ear, and the earring he wore in it. “This.”\n“I was just the delivery girl.”\n“Doesn’t matter. It was what I needed. When I needed it.” He dropped a\nbullet casing, then stilled it with his foot. “I’ll meet you all at the governor’s\nmansion.”\n14\nIf you want to know a man, dig in his firepit.\nThe phrase was from the Roughs, maybe koloss in origin. Basically, it\nmeant that you could judge a lot about a man’s life by what he threw away\n—or by what he was willing to burn in order to stay warm.\nA loud church clock rang eleven as Wax moved through the mists on\nAllomantic jumps. The sound echoed in the night, the bell tower hidden in\nthe darkness. Eleven was not late these days, particularly not in the heart of\nthe city, but it should have marked a time when most men and women had\nbegun to seek their beds. Labor started early in the morning."

Labor started early in the morning.\nOnly, a sizable portion of the laborers in the city didn’t have a job to get\nup for right now. That was reflected in the busy streets and busier pubs, not\nto mention the Soothing parlors he passed, still open well into the night.\nThose were places where the downhearted could seek a different kind of\nrelief, in the form of an Allomancer who—for a small fee—would wipe\naway their emotions for a time and leave them numb.\nRioting parlors were a different beast. There, you could choose the\nemotion you wanted and have it stoked within you. Those might be even\nmore popular, judging by the line he saw outside one.\nWax delayed on a rooftop, listening, then headed for the sound of men\nshouting. He ran along the peaked roof and Pushed off the nails in the\nshingles, launching himself over a set of apartments in a quiet flutter,\ncoming down and landing on a street beyond.\nHere, he found a small Pathian sanctuary. Not the church with the bell\nhe’d heard earlier; Pathian structures were too small for that. Built to\nresemble old Terris huts, they were often empty save for two chairs. One for\nyou. One, ostensibly, for Harmony. The religion forbade worship, in a\nformal way. But talking to God was encouraged.\nTonight, the little sanctuary was under siege.\nThey shouted and threw rocks: a group of shadows in the mist, probably\ndrunk. He could make them out well enough; a misty night was never too\ndark in the city, not with all the ambient light reflecting off the vapors.\nWax yanked Vindication from her holster and stalked forward, mistcoat\nflaring behind him. His profile was enough. The first man who spotted him\nemerging from the mists yelled a warning and the men scattered, leaving\nthe detritus of their tiny riot. Fallen stones. A few bottles. Wax watched\ntheir metal lines to make sure none of them rounded back on him. One\nstopped nearby, but kept his distance.\nHe shook his head, stepping up to the sanctuary. He found the\nmissionary cowering inside, a Terriswoman in intricate braids. Pathian\nclergy was a strange thing. On one hand, the religion emphasized man’s\npersonal connection to Harmony—doing good, without formality. On the\nother hand, people needed direction. Someone to explain all of this. Pathian\nmissionaries—called priests by outsiders, though they rarely used the term\nfor themselves—set up in places like this, explaining the Path to all who\ncame. A clergy, yes, but not in the formal way of the Survivorists.\nHe’d always found it curious that the small Pathian sanctuaries—with\nlarge doorways on eight sides—let in the mists, while Survivorist churches\nobserved the mists from behind domes of glass, comfortable in their ornate\nrooms full of golden statues and fine wood pews. The woman looked up at\nhim as he knelt, smelling oil. Her lantern lay broken nearby.\n“Are you all right?” he asked.\n“I … Yes,” she said. “Thank you.”"

On principle, Wax didn’t holster the\nthing. “It would be best if you retired for the night,” Wax said.\n“But I live in the loft upstairs.”\n“Go to the Village then,” Wax said. “In fact, gather any of your\ncolleagues you can in a short time and take them as well. A Survivorist\npriest has been brutally murdered by someone posing as a Pathian\nmissionary.”\n“Sweet Harmonies,” the woman whispered.\nWax left her to gather her things and, hopefully, do as he told her. He\nstruck out into the night, following a few lines of metal toward where the\nman he’d scared off earlier had hidden. Wax studied the darkened alleyway\nin the mists, then dropped a shell casing and launched himself into the air. A\ncareful Push let him drop straight into the alleyway, where he landed and\nleveled a gun at the head of the person hiding there.\nWho immediately soiled himself, judging from the stench and the liquid\npooling at the young man’s feet. Wax sighed and lifted Vindication. The\nyoung man scrambled backward, stumbling over a box of trash, adding to\nhis humiliation.\n“You’re going to leave that missionary alone,” Wax said. “She had\nnothing to do with the murder.”\nThe youth nodded. Wax dropped a shell casing and prepared to launch\nhimself back into the night.\n“M-murder?” the youth asked.\n“Of the…” Wax hesitated. “Wait. Why were you here, attacking that\nsanctuary?”\nThe boy whimpered. “They came into the pub, two of them in those\nPathian robes, and cursed out the Survivor an’ us.”\n“Two?” Wax said, advancing on the boy, making him cringe. “There\nwas more than one?”\nHe nodded, then—crying—scrambled away and ran into the night. Wax\nlet him go.\nI should have guessed, he thought, launching himself into the air. The\nnews of the murder couldn’t have traveled this quickly. There was more to\nthe plot than the one killing. Rusts. Were other priests in danger?\nTwo people. Bleeder and someone else? Or two helpers? MeLaan had\nseemed confident that Bleeder would be working alone, but this offered\nevidence to the contrary. And the attempt to kill Wax earlier, the ploy\ninvolving the server at ZoBell Tower, matched too well with his fears of an\nassassin to be coincidence. Bleeder had help, likely from Wax’s uncle. He’d\nlook into that later. For now, however, there was a different lead he wanted\nto chase.\nHe eventually reached the location he’d set out to find: Ashweather\nCarriage and Coach, a large open yard at the northern edge of the octant\nwhere a fleet of carriages of various styles was stored. Rich-looking landaus\nwith retractable tops. Conventional buggies, with less lavish upholstery and\nwood, to attract a modest clientele. A few surrey-style, with frilled tops.\nBy far the most common in the carriage park was the standard road\ncoach: the four-wheeled vehicle with a completely enclosed passenger"

        "text": "wood, to attract a modest clientele. A few surrey-style, with frilled tops.\nBy far the most common in the carriage park was the standard road\ncoach: the four-wheeled vehicle with a completely enclosed passenger\ncompartment, and room at the top front for a driver. They called them\nBarringtons in the city, after Lord Barrington, and though the paint jobs\ncould vary wildly, the style was pretty much standardized. Wax’s own\ncoaches were Barringtons.\nHe counted seven in a line here, all lit by electric lamps atop towering\nstanchions high enough to light the whole yard and adjacent large, low\nbuildings. Those were stables, of course, as his nose confirmed. All of the\nAshweather Company’s carriages were painted a shiny black, common for\nvehicles used as cabs in the city, and they had a round shield on the side\nproclaiming the Cett family heritage.\nA shield painted silver. The color that had scraped onto the bricks in the\nalleyway outside the church. Bleeder had likely fled in a coach just like one\nof these, one that had been told to wait while Bleeder killed the priest.\nWax inspected each vehicle in turn, running his fingers over the silver-\npainted shields on the sides. No scrapes.\n“Can I help you?” a curt voice demanded. Steelsight indicated a person\nwalking up the row of vehicles. No weapon held, but metal buttons on his\ncoat, a ring on each hand, some change in the pocket, and a watch in his\nwaistcoat. A few pins in the collar of his shirt—very small lines—gave Wax\nan idea of how tall the man was.\nWax turned toward the voice. The man turned out to be a pudgy fellow\nin a distinctive formal suit with long tails, identifying him as the\nestablishment’s proprietor. Wax had known more than a few Cetts in his\ntime. He’d never gotten along with any of them. Lean or fat, rich or\nscrawny, they all got the same calculating look on their faces as they tried to\nestimate how much money Wax would be willing to part with.\nThis Cett’s eyes flicked toward Wax’s suit, which was rumpled, swum-\nin, and missing the cravat. With the duster on, he likely didn’t look very\ndistinguished—and the man’s expression hardened. Then he saw the tassels\non the duster.\nHis entire demeanor changed immediately. His posture went from “Stay\naway from my coaches” to “You look like the type who will pay extra for\nvelvet pillows.” “My lord,” he added, nodding his head. “Would you like to\nhire a coach for the evening?”\n“You know me?” Wax said.\n“Waxillium Ladrian, I believe.”\n“Good,” Wax said, digging into his pocket and removing a small steel\nsheet, engraved on one side. His credentials, proof that he was a constable.\n“I’m on constabulary business. How many of these coaches do you have?”\nWax nodded toward the line.\nCett’s expression fell as he realized Wax wasn’t likely to be paying him\nfor anything tonight. “Twenty-three,” the man finally said.\n“Lots of coaches still in service for the night,” Wax said. “Considering\nthe hour.”"

        "text": "for anything tonight. “Twenty-three,” the man finally said.\n“Lots of coaches still in service for the night,” Wax said. “Considering\nthe hour.”\n“We work as long as people are out, constable,” Cett said. “And tonight,\npeople are out.”\nWax nodded. “I need a list of the drivers who are still working, their\nroutes, and any prearranged clients they picked up today.”\n“Of course.” Cett seemed more relaxed as he led Wax toward a small\nbuilding in the center of the carriage yard. As they walked, a coach arrived\n—no scraped sides—drawn by a pair of sweaty horses with drooping heads\nand a bit of froth at the mouths. Long hours for the beasts too, it seemed.\nInside the building, Cett fetched some records from a desk. Too eager,\nWax thought as the man hurried over and offered them. Whenever someone\nworked with the authorities too easily, it made Wax’s eye twitch. So he took\nhis time browsing through the lists Cett proffered and kept an eye on the\nman as he did so. “What percentage of your pickups are impromptu, and\nwhat percentage are arranged ahead of time?”\n“Half and half, for the black coaches,” Cett said. “The open carriages\nare more spur-of-the-moment.” He had a good game face, but something\nwas bothering him. What was he hiding?\nYou think everyone is hiding something, Wax told himself, flipping\nthrough the pages. Stay on the task at hand.\nWax dug into the list, hoping Bleeder had decided to hire a coach for a\npickup to be certain she had her escape planned, rather than just grabbing a\ncab on the street. Finding the one who had driven her would be useful either\nway. He looked over the records for the drivers still out for the night. Each\nhad a few prearranged pickups over the course of the day, but only three\nhad been scheduled around the time of the murder. And two of those were\nrepeat customers with a long list of pickups in the past.\nThat left one. A person to be picked up in the Fourth Octant, and to be\ndriven “at liberty,” meaning they were to be driven as long as the client\nwished. Shanwan was the name listed. A Terris name. The word meant\n“secret.”\n“I need to find this driver,” Wax said, holding up the list and pointing. If\nthey’re still alive.\n“Coach sixteen,” Cett said, rubbing his chin. “That’s Chapaou’s. No\ntelling when he’ll be back; you probably don’t want to wait. I can send you\na message when he returns.”\n“Maybe,” Wax said, but dallied.\nThe door slammed open and a young woman in trousers and suspenders\nburst in. “Boss,” she said, “late-night play getting out on Bonnweather.\nThey’re going to want rides.”\n“We sent coaches there already.”\n“Not enough,” the young woman said. “Boss, there are lots of men on\nthe streets. Common men, the type that will make the rich folk nervous.\nPlaygoers will want carriages.”\nCett nodded. “Wake Jone and Forgeron. Send them and anyone else you\ncan rouse. Anything more?”\n“We could have more wheels out for certain, particularly near the pubs.”"

Anything more?”\n“We could have more wheels out for certain, particularly near the pubs.”\n“Coinshot,” Wax guessed, noticing the bag of metal bits—probably\npieces of scrap—the young woman carried. “You’ve been using Allomancer\nrunners to scout for busy areas to send drivers.”\n“Is that surprising?” Cett asked.\n“It’s expensive.”\n“You have to spend money to make money, constable,” Cett said. “And\nas you can see, I’m having a very busy night. Perhaps you could leave me\nto it, if I promise to—”\n“Coinshot,” Wax said to the girl. “You see coach number sixteen out\nthere? I assume your boss has you checking in on the drivers, make sure\nthey’re doing their jobs?”\n“How—” she began.\n“You don’t hire an Allomancer just for traffic reports,” Wax said.\n“Coach sixteen?”\nShe glanced at Cett, who nodded. So whatever Cett was hiding, it\nprobably didn’t have to do with this driver. In fact, it probably didn’t have\nanything to do with Bleeder. Just your average, run-of-the-mill\nlawbreaking.\nAt least one Allomancer on staff, Wax thought.\n“I didn’t see sixteen on the streets,” the young Allomancer said, turning\nto Wax. “But that’s because Chapaou is at a Soothing parlor over on Decan\nStreet. His coach is around the corner.”\n“At a Soothing parlor?” Cett demanded. “He’s on the clock!”\n“I know,” the Allomancer said. “I thought you’d want to hear.”\n“Hm, yes,” Wax said. “And what of the Rioter you have on staff. Are\nthey there too?”\n“Nah,” the Allomancer said. “He’s on—” She cut off, and grew pale.\nThe entire room fell still.\n“Using emotional Allomancy,” Wax said, “to drum up customers. Riot\npassing people, make them feel tired or urgent, and more willing to take the\ncoach conveniently parked right across the street.”\nCett looked sick. Yes, that was it. Flagrant use of a Rioter to drum up\nbusiness, a violation of the Allomantic Agreement of ’94. There were entire\ndepartments in the government that watched for this sort of thing.\nFortunately, while it was a dangerous crime, it wasn’t one that worried Wax\nat the moment.\n“You don’t have any proof…” Cett said, then thought better of it. “I’ll\nbe speaking with my attorney. I’ll have you know that my people are off-\nlimits for interrogation without a judicial order to—”\n“Take it up with the constable-general,” Wax said. “I’m sure you’ll be\nhearing from him soon. For now, I need a description of this carriage driver\nof yours, along with the names of any pets he owns.”\n* * *\nMarasi walked along a counter topped with a row of rifles, each\naccompanied by a domed steel helmet, a folded heavy jacket, and a box of\nammunition.

She hadn’t realized the constabulary had access to these\nkinds of weapons.\n“Well,” she said, looking back at MeLaan, “we’re ready if a koloss\nwarlord decides to invade again.”\nA pair of corporals, both men, were looking over each weapon to\nconfirm it was in good repair. Though she spotted more than one pair of\nbleary eyes, the place was alive with activity. More and more constables\nwere arriving, called in for extra duty. As they entered through the main\ndoors they tended to stop as Marasi had, looking at the row of weapons.\nPerhaps that was why Aradel had ordered them set out like this. A quick\nvisual reminder of how dangerous things were growing in the city.\nMarasi rounded the front counter and entered the offices behind. A\nyoung woman corporal passed by, handing Marasi a warm cup of dark tea.\nIt smelled strong, cooked down to increase the concentration of caffeine.\nShe tried a sip.\nYup. Awful. She drank another sip anyway. She wasn’t going to\nembarrass herself by asking for honey when everyone else was chugging\nthe stuff like it was some kind of contest. MeLaan trailed after her, looking\naround the room with interest. The voluptuous kandra drew glances. And,\nwell, stares. It wasn’t often that a gorgeous, six-and-a-half-foot-tall woman\nstrode into the constabulary offices clad in trousers and a tight shirt. She\nseemed to like the attention, judging by the way she smiled at the men they\npassed.\nOf course she likes the attention, Marasi thought. Otherwise she\nwouldn’t have chosen a body so exquisitely proportioned. It seemed blatant\nto Marasi. After all, technically MeLaan wasn’t even human.\n“I didn’t expect to find women in uniform here,” MeLaan noted. “I’d\nassumed you to be an oddity.”\n“The constabulary is very egalitarian,” Marasi said. “The Ascendant\nWarrior serves as a model for all women. You won’t find as many of us here\nas in, say, the solicitors’ offices, but it’s hardly considered an unfeminine\nprofession.”\n“Sure, sure,” MeLaan said, smiling at a young lieutenant as the two of\nthem made their way to the back rooms, where the records office was. “But\nI’ve always found humans to be rather sexist. A natural result of your sexual\ndimorphism, VenDell says.”\n“And kandra aren’t sexist?” Marasi said, blushing.\n“Hmm? Well, considering that a male kandra you’re talking to today\nmight decide to be a woman tomorrow, I’d say we have a different\nperspective on all that.”\nMarasi blushed further. “Surely you’re exaggerating.”\n“Not really. Wow, you blush easily, don’t you? I’d have thought you’d\nfind this natural, considering that your God is basically a hermaphrodite at\nthis point. Both good and evil, Ruin and Preservation, light and dark, male\nand female. Et cetera et cetera.”\nThey reached the doors to the records office and Marasi turned away to\nhide her blush.

        "text": "and female. Et cetera et cetera.”\nThey reached the doors to the records office and Marasi turned away to\nhide her blush. She really wished she’d just find a way to get over her\nembarrassment. “Harmony’s not my god. I’m a Survivorist.”\n“Oh, yeah,” MeLaan said, “because that makes sense. Worship the guy\nwho died, rather than the one who saved the world.”\n“The Survivor transcended death,” Marasi said, looking back, hand on\nthe door, but not entering. “He survived even being killed, adopting the\nmantle of the Ascendant during the time between Preservation’s death and\nVin’s Ascension.”\nRust … was she arguing theology with a demigod?\nMeLaan, however, just cocked her head. “What, really?”\n“Um … yes. Harmony wrote of it himself in the Words of Founding,\nMeLaan.”\n“Huh. I really ought to read that thing one of these days.”\n“You haven’t…” Marasi blinked, trying to fathom a world where one of\nthe Faceless Immortals didn’t know doctrine.\n“I keep meaning to,” MeLaan said, shrugging. “Never can find the\ntime.”\n“You’re over six hundred years old.”\n“That’s the thing about having an eternity, kid,” MeLaan said. “It gets\nreally easy to procrastinate. Are we going in that room or not?”\nMarasi sighed, pushing into a room filled with filing cabinets and tables\npiled high with ledgers and broadsheets. This was Aradel’s doing; he liked\nto keep his thumb on what people were saying and writing in the city. So\nfar, he didn’t do much with the collection besides watch for reports of\ncrimes his men had missed, but Marasi had plans.\nUnfortunately, Constable Miklin—who ran the records office—was one\nof Reddi’s closest friends. As Marasi entered, Miklin and the other two\npeople working there looked up, then immediately turned back to their files.\n“Who’s the civilian?” Miklin asked from his desk in the corner. How did\nhe get his hair to stand up straight like that? Almost like a patch of grass\ngrowing from a pot.\n“Special investigator from another jurisdiction,” Marasi said. “Lord\nLadrian sent her.”\nMiklin sniffed. “I’m led to believe this wisp hunt is your doing? I barely\ngot to the offices tonight before I was sent back here to dig up information\non that dam breaking.”\n“What did you find?” Marasi said eagerly, slipping between two large\nfiling cabinets—he had them arranged like sentries—and stepping up to his\ndesk.\n“Nothing,” Miklin said. “Dead end. Waste of my time.”\n“I’d like to see what you found anyway,” Marasi said. “If it’s not too\nmuch trouble.”\nMiklin rested his hands on the table. He spoke softly. “Why are you\nhere, Colms?”\n“I thought Aradel told you,” Marasi said. “The dam breakage might—”\n“Not that. Here. In the constabulary. You had an offer to join the octant’s\nsenior prosecutor on a permanent basis, with a letter of commendation on\nyour internship with him. I looked into it. And now … what? You suddenly"

Strap on some six-guns like you’re from the\nrusting Roughs? That’s not what police work is like.”\n“I’m well aware,” Marasi said dryly. “But thank you for the\ninformation. What did you find?”\nHe sighed, then tapped a folder with the back of his hand. “Rusting\nwaste of my time,” he muttered.\nMarasi took the folder and retreated between the filing cabinets. She\nwished it were only Miklin she had to deal with, but the two other\nconstables made their opinions known with quiet sniffs of disdain. Marasi\nfelt them glaring at her as she led MeLaan out of the room, clutching her\nfolder.\n“Why do they treat you like that?” MeLaan asked as they slipped out.\n“It’s complicated.”\n“People tend to be. Why do you let them treat you like that?”\n“I’m working on it.”\n“You want me to do something?” MeLaan said. “I could scare the\ncynicism right out of those people, show them you’ve got friends that—”\n“No!” Marasi said. “No, please. It’s nothing I haven’t dealt with\nbefore.”\nMeLaan followed her as she scurried to her desk outside of Aradel’s\noffice. A lanky female constable stood there, one foot on Marasi’s chair,\nchatting with the man one desk over and sipping her tea. Marasi cleared her\nthroat twice before the woman—Taudr was her name, wasn’t it?—finally\nlooked at her, rolled her eyes, and moved out of the way.\nMarasi settled down. MeLaan pulled over a chair. “You sure you don’t\nwant me—”\n“No,” Marasi said immediately, digging into the folder. She took a deep\nbreath. “No, please.”\n“I’m sure your friend Waxillium could come on over, fire off a few\nslugs, force them to stop being such sourlips.”\nOh, Survivor, no, Marasi thought, the image of it making her sick. But\nMeLaan obviously wasn’t going to let this go without an explanation.\n“I’m beginning to realize that Waxillium is part of the reason why they\ntreat me as they do,” Marasi said, opening the folder Miklin had prepared.\n“Life in the precinct follows a hierarchy. The sergeants start as corporals,\nwork the streets, put in ten or fifteen years doing a hard beat and finally earn\na promotion. The captains start out as lieutenants, and mostly come from\nnoble stock. Once in a while, a sergeant works his or her way up. But\neveryone’s expected to put in their time at the bottom.”\n“And you…”\n“I skipped all that,” Marasi said. “I applied for—and got—an important\nposition as Aradel’s chief aide. Waxillium makes that worse, as I’m\nassociated with him. He’s like a whirlwind, blowing through and messing\neverything up. But he’s also good at what he does and a high-ranking\nnobleman, so nobody complains too loudly. I, however…”\n“Not noble.”\n“Not noble enough,” Marasi said. “My father is low-ranked, and I’m"

That makes me the available target, when Waxillium is off-\nlimits.”\nMeLaan leaned back in her chair and scanned the room. “Spook was\nalways droning on about things like this—that bloodline shouldn’t matter as\nmuch as capability. You doing what you did should be impressive to\neveryone, not threatening. Hell, you said the place was egalitarian.”\n“It is,” Marasi said. “That’s why I could get the job in the first place.\nBut it doesn’t stop people from resenting me. I’m the way the world is\nchanging, MeLaan, and change is frightening.”\n“Huh,” the kandra said. “And the lower ranks just go along with this?\nYou think they’d like you showing that someone can jump in line.”\n“You don’t know a lot about human nature, do you?”\n“Of course I do. I’ve studied, and imitated, dozens of people.”\n“I suspect you understand individuals, then,” Marasi said. “The\ninteresting thing about people is that while they might seem unique, they\nactually play into broad patterns. Historically, the working class has often\nbeen more resistant to change than the class oppressing them.”\n“Really?” MeLaan asked.\nMarasi nodded. She started to reach for some books on the small shelf\nbeside her desk, but stopped. This wasn’t the time. In fact, they might be\nwitnessing one of the exceptions to this rule, outside on the streets. And,\nlike many upendings of the status quo, when it did happen, it could be\nviolent. Like a steam engine’s boiler that had been plugged up, given no\nrelease until suddenly … everything exploded.\nNobody liked to realize they’d been had. People in Elendel believed\nthey were living the good life—they’d been told all their lives that\nHarmony had blessed them with a rich and lavish land of bounty. You could\nlisten to that sort of talk only so long before starting to wonder why all the\nincredible orchards were owned by someone else, while you had to work\nlong hours just to feed your children.\nMarasi dug into the contents of the folder, which listed the events\nsurrounding the flooding to the east. MeLaan settled back in her seat. What\na curious creature she was, sitting with head held high, meeting the glances\nof people who passed without the least concern about what anyone thought\nof her.\nMiklin was annoying, but he hadn’t let his displeasure undermine his\nwork, which was meticulous and thorough. He’d included constable reports\non the dam breakage, a piece written by the engineer who had investigated\nthe problem, and broadsheet clippings from Elendel regarding the disaster.\nMost importantly, there was a transcript of the recent trial and execution\nof the farmer who had caused the flood. He claimed he’d wanted to ruin his\nneighbor’s harvest in an “accident.” But the saboteur had packed too much\ndynamite, and had blown a hole in the dam large enough to cause the entire\nthing to fail.

They claimed he was obviously\nmad.

We don’t\nhave to do that so much anymore—most of the forms we take are personas\nwe’ve made up ourselves. If this was Bleeder, she must have been pressed\nfor time.” MeLaan pointed at a section farther down the page. “This is\nmuch better proof, if you ask me.”\nMarasi scooted over, looking at the paragraphs indicated.\nReport of the execution. Prisoner was hanged until dead. Rejected a\nfinal meal, and demanded it be “over with quickly.” Grave\ndesecrated two nights later; suspected to be the work of those who\nlost family in the flood.\n“Wow,” Marasi said, taking the paper back. She hadn’t reached that\nsection yet. “Yeah. Escaping the grave, eh? She actually let them bury her?”\n“Undoubtedly,” MeLaan said. “Paalm is nothing if not dedicated to her\ncraft.”\n“Then why forget the names of the children?”\nMeLaan shook her head. “No idea.”\nEither way, this seemed to be enough to take to Aradel. “Come on,” she\nsaid.\n15\nOne thing that Wax’s life in the Roughs had taught him was that men would\nmonetize anything. The first time he’d seen someone selling water, he’d\nbeen surprised. Who sold something that literally fell from the sky?\nNow, more than twenty years later, he was surprised nobody in Elendel\nhad found a way to charge a tax on collecting rainwater. If someone wanted\nit, you could charge for it. That went double for Allomancy, though there\nwere some conservatives who decried the increasing commercialization of\nthe Metallic Arts. Feruchemists for hire were much scarcer than\nAllomancers, perhaps because Terris traditions viewed their powers with\nsuch reverence.\nWax walked up the steps toward the building, which stood alone on the\nstreet in a fairly nice neighborhood of town, even if this was the darker end\nof the lane, so to speak. The place was two stories tall, and had the window\nshades drawn, though light inside gave them a warm glow. A black coach—\nwith a silver crest, scraped across its face—was parked in the drive to the\nright.\nThe Soothing washed over him right as he reached the door.

Visiting one was more expensive than a night at the pub, but had\nnone of the side effects. Or to be more precise, it had different side effects.\nA woman in a matronly gown—and a hat, likely aluminum-lined—\napproached Wax, probably to take payment, but Wax flashed his credentials.\n“If you think credentials will get you in free,” the proprietor said, “then\nyou must be new to the force.”\nWax gave her a dry smile, tucking away the metal plate. She ran a low-\ngrade Soothing parlor. While what she did wasn’t illegal—amusingly, it was\nfine to manipulate people’s emotions so long as they were paying for it—\nshe’d be used to the constables checking up on her. Not only did these sorts\nof places tend to attract people who were hiding from something, it was\nvery possible for a disreputable Soothing parlor to take advantage of its\nclients.\nNone of the people here matched Chapaou’s description, but Soothing\nparlors often had more than one room. “Short man,” Wax said, “balding.\nKnown as Chapaou, but may not have given that name.”\nThe proprietor nodded and gestured for Wax to follow as she crossed the\nroom, weaving between the people lounging on the floor. The dim, smoky\nbuilding should have left Wax jumpy—this was just the sort of place where\naccidents or ambushes happened—but the Soothing was difficult to pierce.\nIt tore away the top layers of his concern, exposing those beneath—his\nworry for Wayne and Marasi. Beneath that, a surprising frustration—even\nanger—at God. Then those emotions too became as fluttering wings,\nleaving him hollow. Not calm, just empty.\nHe wanted to settle into one of the chairs, close his eyes, and let out a\nsigh of relaxation. Bleeder would wait. Surely she wouldn’t try to kill again\ntonight. Why worry if she did? He probably couldn’t stop her anyway.\nHe found he hated that sensation. These emotions were his; they were a\ncore of his self. Taking them away didn’t make him happy or help him\nforget. It just made him feel sick.\nHe picked up his pace, trying to urge the proprietor faster as they left the\nroom with the cushions and stepped into a long hallway.

Parlors were\nsupposed to have aluminum sheets in the walls to keep the emotional\nAllomancy contained from the neighborhood, but the rule wasn’t uniformly\nenforced.\nThe proprietor led Wax to a small room on the second floor, unadorned\nsave for a couch at the center for massages. Chapaou didn’t lie on that.\nInstead, he paced by a latched window in the far wall, frustrating the\nmasseuse who stood nearby with her arms folded. An old man sat in a chair\nby the wall. The metal vials in his pocket—visible to Wax as small, diffuse\nlines pointing at the suspended flakes—marked him as an Allomancer.\nWax raised his eyebrow. Chapaou had paid for a private session. Where\nhad he found that kind of money? The coach driver stopped in place,\nlooking toward Wax. His eyes flicked toward the guns at Wax’s hips, then\nhe fell to his knees, weeping.\nThe aged Soother rose with audible cracks from his joints. “I’ve done\nwhat I can, Mistress Halex,” he said to the proprietor. “But this man doesn’t\nneed Allomancy. He needs a physician.”\n“He’s yours,” Mistress Halex said to Wax. “Get him out of here. He’s\ndisturbing my people.”\nWax crossed the room to kneel beside Chapaou. The short man\nshivered, holding his legs. “Chapaou,” Wax said. “Look at me.”\nChapaou turned toward him.\n“What’s the name of your dog?” Wax asked.\n“My … I don’t have a dog. He died a few years back.”\nGood enough. This wasn’t Bleeder in disguise, unless she’d thought to\ninterrogate a random cabdriver about his pets before killing him and taking\nhis shape.\n“What’s wrong?” Wax said. “Why are you here?”\n“To forget what I saw.”\n“Soothing doesn’t work like that,” Wax said. “It doesn’t take your\nmemories.”\n“But it should make me feel better, right?”\n“Depends on the emotions you’re feeling,” Wax said, “and the skill of\nthe Soother.” He held the man by the shoulder. “What did you see,\nChapaou?”\nThe man blinked reddened eyes. “I saw … myself.”\n* * *\nAradel wasn’t in his office, of course. That place was there, as he put it, “for\ngiving house lords somewhere to sit when they come to complain at me.”\nMarasi found him on the roof of the constabulary offices listening to\nreports from the two precinct Coinshots who had been scouting the city.\nMarasi politely waited with MeLaan and several constable lieutenants\nstanding nearby, and was able to hear most of the latest report.

        "text": "reports from the two precinct Coinshots who had been scouting the city.\nMarasi politely waited with MeLaan and several constable lieutenants\nstanding nearby, and was able to hear most of the latest report. Thousands\nstill on the streets, my lord. They’re congregating at pubs. Not going\nhome …\nAradel stood with one booted foot up on the short wall around the\nrooftop as he took the reports. Mist curled around each Coinshot in a\ndistinct vortex; it responded to the use of Allomancy. Finally, Aradel\ndismissed the two. They weren’t true constables—more contractors. Their\nloyalties would be to their houses. Or in some cases to their pocketbooks.\nAs they left—jumping off the building—the constable-general turned to\nthe waiting lieutenants. “Get the men ready to clear out the pubs,” he said\nsoftly.\n“Sir?” one of the women asked.\n“We’re going to close them down,” Aradel said, pointing. “First on the\npromenades, then work down the smaller streets. We can’t start until I get\nauthority from the governor to institute martial law in the octant, but I want\nthe constables ready to move as soon as we have word.”\nThe lieutenants ran to obey. Aradel glanced toward Marasi, and she\nthought she saw something of his ancestor in him, a soldier who had died a\nmartyr during the days of the Ascendant Warrior. In another era, would this\nman have been a field general rather than a policeman?\n“What do you have for me, Lieutenant Colms?” he said, waving her\nforward. MeLaan lingered by the stairwell down, hands in her trouser\npockets.\n“Our assassin, sir,” Marasi said, proffering the folder. “She dug her way\nout of her own grave after being executed for causing the floods in the east.\nThey found the bones nearby a few days later, and called it desecration of\nthe grave. After all, why would they guess that one of the holy Faceless\nImmortals had been inhabiting the body of a murderer and criminal?”\nAradel breathed out quietly in a hiss. Shadows moved beneath the\nstreetlights, despite the hour, on the promenade behind him. “So this is all\nher doing?”\n“Pardon, sir,” Marasi said, “but I’d say this is rather the fault of the\ncity’s unpleasant working conditions. That said, Bleeder is most certainly\nshoving it along. She wanted this city to be on the brink of cracking when\nshe made her move.”\n“Ruin…” Aradel whispered. “In the face of that, it seems almost trivial\nwhether the governor is corrupt or not, doesn’t it?”\n“I suppose that depends on whom you ask.” Shouts rose from the street\ndown below; a group of men passing along the canal, speaking riotously to\none another. She couldn’t make out their words, just their tone.\n“I still want proof,” Aradel said. “Not to diminish your efforts,\nLieutenant. But I’m not going to jump at wraiths in the mist unless I can see\nfor myself. That goes for the governor too. Keep your eyes open. If you can\nfind me something concrete, we’ll use it once this all blows over. And I still\nwant some kind of proof regarding your supernatural assassin.”"

And I still\nwant some kind of proof regarding your supernatural assassin.”\n“I understand, sir,” Marasi said, nodding toward MeLaan, lit by the\nlanterns hanging on poles near the door to the stairs. “And I have some\nproof for you there. But it would be best if we could do this in private.”\nAradel slowly shifted his weight backward, lowering his foot from the\ntop of the parapet he’d been leaning on. He glanced at Marasi, who nodded.\n“Below,” he said to the two remaining constables attending him. Junior\ncorporals, for message running. They obeyed, and once they were gone,\nAradel crossed the distance to MeLaan. “I hope,” he said, after clearing his\nthroat, “that my questions aren’t offensive, er, Your Grace.”\n“Sincere inquiries never offend, human,” MeLaan said, “for it is thy\nduty to seek truth. True questions return only truth.” Her skin shimmered,\ngrowing transparent as it had before, but somehow also giving off a\nkaleidoscopic sheen. She spread her hands to the sides, and her blouse\nsomehow split and slid down her shoulders, exposing a transparent torso\nwith an emerald skeleton that glittered in the lamplight.\nMarasi blinked. Well, that hadn’t been what she’d been expecting.\nBeside her, Aradel inhaled sharply, then didn’t seem to be breathing at all as\nhe took in the sight. MeLaan’s head—completely transparent—cocked, and\nshe looked down at them with a maternal cast.\n“Speak,” she whispered.\n“What…” Aradel cleared his throat. “Is what Constable Colms has told\nme true? Could one of your kind really be behind this?”\n“Paalm is a lost soul,” MeLaan said, “tortured by a broken mind and a\ntwisted spirit. Yes, she is of us, human. Thy task is not easy, but we shall aid\nthee in thy desperation.”\n“Great,” Aradel said. “I guess … I guess that’s the confirmation I\nneeded.” He hesitated. “Could you, by any chance, put in a good word for\nme with Harmony?”\n“Thy deeds are thine own good words, human,” MeLaan said. “And thy\nGod knows of them. Go and protect this city. Worry not for thyself, but\ninstead for thy fellows.”\n“Right, right,” Aradel said. “I’ll just be about it, then. Unless there’s\nanything more you can tell me…”\n“Thy snoring,” MeLaan said, “is rather loud.”\n“I … What?”\n“It doth be like unto an hundred angry koloss,” MeLaan said, “in the\nmiddle of a rockslide. Lo, and it doth come near to waking the dead.”\n“Right…” Aradel said.\n“Be on thy way, human,” MeLaan said.\n“As commanded.

MeLaan was\noverwhelming even when she wasn’t transparent and half naked. MeLaan\nnodded Marasi onward. No need to come back up for her.\nWhen they were halfway down the stairs, Aradel let out a deep breath.\n“Well, that was strange.”\n“I did warn you,” Marasi noted.\n“That you did. The bit about snoring … a metaphor, I assume. But for\nwhat? The constables, we’re too loud, perhaps?” He nodded to himself.\n“We’re supposed to serve the people, but the complaints of brutality, and of\nofficers ordering people around as if they were lords … Yes, I can see. I’ll\nneed to make some changes. Do you think that’s what she meant?”\n“I don’t know,” Marasi said carefully. “Meeting her does tend to affect\none in profound ways.”\n“Very true.” Aradel hesitated on the steps, turning as if he longed to\nreturn up above. He held himself back. “The question I had earlier remains.\nWe’ve got an immortal killer out there, potentially trying to overthrow the\ngovernment. How in Preservation do we fight something like that?”\n“You don’t,” Marasi said. “Lord Waxillium will handle the kandra. We\nshould focus on keeping the city from exploding.”\nAradel nodded. “I want you to do something for me.”\n“Sir?” They still stood in the stairwell, lit by a solitary electric light\nabove them.\n“You mention Lord Ladrian,” Aradel said. “He seems to trust you,\nLieutenant.”\n“We have become good friends over the last year.”\n“He’s a wildcard, Lieutenant,” Aradel said. “I appreciate the work he\ndoes, but his methods … let’s just say I wouldn’t mind having a little more\ninformation on what he’s doing and when.”\n“You’re asking me to spy on him.”\nAradel shrugged. Another man might have been embarrassed to be\nconfronted with it so bluntly, but he didn’t seem so. “I won’t lie to you,\nColms. I think you can be a resource for this department in more ways than\none. It’s my job to see that the law in this octant is served, and I’ll feel a\nhell of a lot better if I know what Lord Ladrian is doing. If only so I can get\nthe proper warrants—and if necessary, apologies—ready.”\n“I see,” Marasi said.\nAradel waited for something more. She could practically hear the\nimplication. You’re a constable, Lieutenant. This is your job. Do as you are\nassigned.\n“You could just ask him,” she said. “He’s been deputized. He is\ntechnically under your jurisdiction.”\n“And you don’t think I’ve tried? He always promises a report. If I’m\nlucky, that consists of a letter telling me where he left a suspect hanging by\nhis ankles—do you remember that one?—or a quick rundown at a party of\nsomething he’s hunting, if only so he can ask me for the loan of some\nresources. I don’t mean to turn you into his chaperone, but honestly, a little\nmore information would be wonderful.”\nMarasi sighed. “I’ll write you a weekly report. More frequently if an"

More frequently if an\ninvestigation is ongoing, as it is now. But I will inform him that I’m doing\nso.”\n“Great. Fantastic.” Aradel started down the stairs again, stepping\nquickly and speaking almost as fast. “Get to the governor’s place and tell\nhim I need an executive order for martial law tonight so I can clear the\npubs. Suggest he send one to each of the octants. Then check in on your\nfriend Ladrian and tell me anything he’s learned about this immortal who\nthinks she can bring down our city.”\nHe reached the floor below and strode out into the main chamber,\nshouting for a report on the number of constables they’d been able to call\nup for duty this night. Marasi followed more slowly, legs feeling like they\nbore hundred-pound bracers.\nYou can be a resource for this department in more ways than one.…\nShe reached the ground floor and walked out the precinct’s back door.\nShe’d always known that her involvement with Waxillium had helped her\nobtain this job. If she hadn’t joined his hunt for Miles Hundredlives, she’d\nnever have gained enough notability. That said, she’d assumed her\nunderstanding of historical crime rates, her letters of recommendation, and\nher interview had been more important.\nWas that even the case? Had Aradel given her the job instead of\nsomeone like Reddi because she knew Waxillium? Did her studies even\nmatter?\nShe settled with her back against the wall, waiting for MeLaan. Rusts …\ndid everything always have to be about Waxillium? Of course, thinking that\nmade her feel like a child, jealous that someone else had more blocks than\nshe did.\nMeLaan strolled into the alleyway a short time later, disturbing the\nmists. “Well?” MeLaan asked. “How did I do?”\n“We shall aid thee in thy desperation?” Marasi asked.\n“Hey, it’s what he expected.”\n“Not what I expected.”\nMeLaan sniffed. “I can be divine when I need to be. I’ve had a long\ntime to practice.”\n“Then why don’t you use the act around me and the others?”\n“Who says this isn’t the act?” MeLaan said. She met Marasi’s eyes.\n“Perhaps my duty as one of Harmony’s servants is to show people what\nthey need to see, whatever will bring them the most peace.”\nMarasi felt cold, suddenly, a shiver running through her. Not at the\nwords, but at the look in MeLaan’s eyes, which had faded to a faint\ntranslucence. As if … in reminder?\nThen MeLaan threw her head back and started laughing. “Nah, I’m just\nrusting you, kid. I don’t show you that side because it’s too hard to keep a\nstraight face while talking with all those ‘thee’s and ‘whatfore’s.”\n“Hence the snoring wisecrack?” Marasi said.\n“Yeah. I had to check on the guy when Harmony was first looking for\nPaalm. He snores like a steam engine, that one. Anyway, where to now?”\n“The governor’s mansion,” Marasi said."

Anyway, where to now?”\n“The governor’s mansion,” Marasi said.\n“Along we go, then,” MeLaan said, striding toward the exit of the\nalleyway.\n* * *\n“We pulled to a stop,” Chapaou said, hunched up next to his carriage in the\nmists outside the Soother’s place. “And I’d been hearing things inside the\ncoach. I didn’t like how he’d come out of that church, with hands all red.”\nWax knelt in the back of the coach, listening while he carefully\nunwrapped a bundle of black cloth. A lantern hung on the side of the coach,\ngiving him light, but also turning the mists into a bloom of illumination. He\ncould still feel the Soother’s touch from the nearby building, but it was far\nless pronounced now. He felt almost like himself. That was both good and\nbad, for there was nothing to hold back his sense of revulsion as he\nunwrapped the bloody mallet that had been used to pound the spikes into\nFather Bin.\n“I shouldn’t have looked into the coach,” Chapaou said. “He told me not\nto look, you know? But I couldn’t help it. So I turned softly and peeked in\nthe coachman’s slot, the one they have so you can see if the person inside is\nripping the upholstery or whatnot.\n“I found I hadn’t been carrying a man, but a monster. A mistwraith, with\nbones and sinew exposed, and a face of stretched muscle and grinning teeth.\nIt looked at me, all smiles, and scrambled up toward the hole. It pressed that\nexposed eye against the slot, and then it changed. It changed. Skin growing\nover its face, like mine. A twisted, broken version of me.”\nHe started weeping again. Wax unrolled bones from the bundle, the\ncorpse of the Pathian whom Bleeder had imitated in order to kill Father Bin.\nBleached, picked clean, and under them a pile of cloth. Pathian robes? Yes,\nthe colors were right.\n“Hands all red…” Chapaou whispered.\n“You ran, after that?” Wax asked, lining up the bones carefully.\n“No, I drove,” Chapaou said. “I whipped the horses forward, bearing\nthat demonspawn in my coach. A driver for Ironeyes himself. What good\nwould it do to run? It had my soul. Harmony … it has my soul.”\n“No,” Wax said. “It is a trickster, a false face, Chapaou. It was a twisted\nversion of yourself, you say?” MeLaan had said that older kandra could\noften approximate a face without having the right bones, but it was always\nnoticeable.\n“Yeah.” The man huddled down lower in the alleyway. “I know what\nyou think, lawman. I killed that priest tonight, didn’t I? I went mad, and I\nkilled him, and those bloody hands are mine. Shoulda killed myself, jumped\noff that bridge…”\n“No,” Wax said. “You’ve been taken in by a charlatan, Chapaou. It\nwasn’t you.”\nThe man just whimpered."

It\nwasn’t you.”\nThe man just whimpered.\nWax continued, methodically laying out the evidence, though a part of\nhim wondered what good it would do. Did traditional detective work have\nany place in a fight against a creature like this? How did you fight\nmythology with a microscope? Harmony … what if he did find a clue? If he\nchased her down? Could he even defeat something like this?\nHe stared at the bones, then shook his head. He would send for a crime-\nscene team to look this over. He needed to get to the governor’s mansion\nand check in.\nWait, he thought, then leaned forward. There, on the hem of the robe.\nWhat was that? He shielded the lantern, causing Chapaou to groan and\nhuddle down farther.\nWith the lantern dimmed, Wax spotted it better. The corner of the robe’s\nhem glowed with a soft blue light, easy to miss. Wax reached down, taking\na substance off the robe and rubbing it between his fingers. A powder of\nsome sort? What kind of powder gave off its own light, faint though it was?\n“Did you see anything glowing back here, Chapaou?” he asked, turning\ntoward the man. Wax had to unshield the lantern to get him to respond.\nEven then, the only reply he got was a confused shake of the head.\n“Where did you drive the coach?” Wax asked.\n“Lestib Square,” Chapaou whispered. “Where I’d been told to drop the\ncreature off. Then I squeezed my eyes shut and waited. It … it climbed up\nto me, as it left. Hands on my shoulders, head beside mine, cheeks\ntouching. I could feel the blood, though it left none staining my shirt. It …\nit whispered to me, lawman. ‘I will make you free.’ When I opened my eyes\nit had gone, leaving those bones in the passenger compartment along with a\nsmall pile of coins. I thought for sure I’d gone mad.”\nWax downed an extra vial of metals to refill his stores, then dried the\nvial out and took a sample of the dust. Lestib Square, named after the Lord\nMistborn. It was worryingly close to the governor’s mansion. “Don’t worry.\nI’m on the thing’s trail. I intend to stop it.”\n“It said it would make me free,” Chapaou said. “If I’m not mad, then\nthat means … that means that thing was real.”\n“It is,” Wax said.\n“Honestly, sir, I’d rather be crazy.”\n“Eh,” Wax said, rising and pushing Chapaou toward his coach. “The\nthing probably doesn’t want you dead anyway.”\n“Probably?”\n“No way to tell for certain,” Wax said, checking his ammunition. “But\nI’d bet money against it—at least, it no more wants you dead than it wants\neveryone in the city dead. Maybe. Not sure yet what its endgame is.”\nChapaou looked sick. Damn. He was sure that last part had been\ncomforting.\n“Go home,” Wax said, then tossed the man a few banknotes. “Or go find\na hotel. Get some sleep. She isn’t going to come for you.”"

My residence in the 6th Octant, much nearer the Hub, has needed twice\nthat attention due to it being on the main route of Coinshot couriers. Motor cars, carriages, bronze\nstatues. None of these is safe from similar fates. Must our fine neighborhoods look like a return to the\nWorld of Ash?\nNo! Let us take back our dignity! (Continued on Back.)\nVISITORS from other WORLDS\nRarely does The House Record bring news of the sensational, but the reputable Lady Nicelle\nSauvage of New Seran has contacted us with a report that will shock you.\n“I was lost in the mountains south of the Southern Roughs,” said Sauvage. “And my fellow\ntravellers had either left me or died. That’s when I came upon a mountain pool of the most perfect\nblue, fed by the melting snows of the heights. Harmony, but I thought I’d reached Paradise.”\nAs twilight struck early, as it is wont to do in the mountains, Sauvage saw a hunched figure by the\npool. “Just a shadow, really,” she said. “Piercing eyes, and a face like some otherworldly beast from\none of those hideous pulp stories. I regret to say I hadn’t the courage to engage this Visitor. Instead,\nits horrible visage struck right at my heart. I let preservation instinct take over and ran for an hour\nbefore making camp elsewhere.”\n(More on Back, Column 4.)\nThe Sinister Soiree!\nI described my assailant as wearing a striped white suit, but that is not as specific as it may seem.\nIn Elendel, someone dressed as described would stick out like afternoon tea among koloss, but in\nNew Seran the men run about in such vibrant suits that one would almost think they are all\nperformers late for the circus. So I will be more specific. The gunman also wore mustaches waxed\nstraight horizontal to a perfect point. The women on both sides of him stood back not only because\nhe had brandished a gun, but also because they feared losing eyes to the sharp and glistening facial\nhair.\nI burned what little tin reserves I had left. (You will recall that I detailed the episode last week in\n“A Sport of Spirits” where I’d been forced to flare most of my tin to counteract the effects of winning\na gentlemanly impromptu wine-sipping contest earlier in the evening.)\n“Stand down, sir,” I said, cursing myself for leaving Glint in my outer jacket taken by the servant\nwhen I’d entered the party. Had I become so soft since leaving the Roughs that I felt comfortable\nenough without Glint on my very person? Never!

Unconsciously I knew that even without my trusty\nsidearm I was a match\n16\nWax perched on an electricity pylon, overlooking the governor’s mansion—\na clean white building, brightly lit in the mists by floodlights. Those didn’t\nshine so strongly every night, and their brightness tonight seemed to\nindicate that Innate was worried. The crowds were not dispersing. Men\nroamed the streets; there seemed to be more of them than there had been\nearlier, though the clock had struck midnight soon after Wax had left the\nSoothing parlor.\nHe’d stopped by his house to rebind his arm wound, chew down some\npainkillers, and pick up some supplies: his hat, his short-barreled shotgun,\nand his thigh holster. He’d considered sending someone for Lord Harms,\nbut honestly, Wax wanted him safe where Bleeder couldn’t use the man\nagainst him. Better that he stay hidden on his rooftop. In fact, he’d been half\ntempted to go fetch Steris and drop her somewhere similar. Time was short,\nunfortunately. He had to trust that the constables watching her would keep\nher hidden.\nFrom there, he’d walked the streets a short time, listening. He’d\noverheard anger at the government. Vitriol for the Pathians. Those\ncomplaints were bad enough, but mixed with them was a more disturbing\ntrend. Anger, but with no focus. General discontent. The grumbling of men\nover their beers, of youths out on the street throwing rocks at cats. Hiding\namid it all was a murderer, like a lion in the grass.\nAt least the governor’s mansion looked calm. He’d come fearing the\nworst, a strike on Innate while he was away. She’s got me pinned, Wax\nthought with dissatisfaction, as the breeze rustled his mistcoat. I can’t stay\nand protect the governor because I have to follow leads and try to figure out\nher plan. But I can’t be as effective in that hunt because I keep worrying\nthat I’m leaving Innate exposed.\nCould he convince the governor to hide? Beneath his feet, electricity ran\nlike an invisible river through the suspended cables. Spirits that moved like\nAllomancers in the sky, hopping from building to building …\nAh, lawman, a voice intruded upon his thoughts like a nail into a board.\nThere you are.\nWax reached to his waist for Vindication. Where? This had to mean\nBleeder was close, right? Watching somewhere?\nDo you know, the voice said, about the body’s remarkable defenses?\nInside, there are tiny bits of you that men never see. Even surgeons don’t\nknow of them, for they’re too small. It takes a refined taste to distinguish\nthem, know them. What is it that your friend likes to say? Ain’t nobody what\nknows the cow better than the butcher?\nWax dropped down from his perch, slowing himself by Pushing on a\ndiscarded bottle cap. Mists churned around him, drawn by his Allomancy.\nIf a tiny invader enters your blood, Bleeder said, the entire body begins\nto spin around it, to fight it, to find it and eliminate it.

Or did she just have the ability to make ears that\nworked better than human ones? He kept searching. Perhaps one of those\ndark windows in the government building nearby? Wax headed that way.\n“Is that why you’re targeting the governor, then?” he asked. “You want to\nbring him down, free the people from the government’s oppression?”\nYou know he’s just another pawn.\n“I don’t know that.”\nI wasn’t talking to you that time, Waxillium.\nHe hesitated in the mists. The office building loomed before him, the\nwindows a hundred hollow eyes. Most of those windows were closed—a\ncommon practice at night. No need to invite the mists in. Religion could say\nwhat it wished, and people believed, mostly. But the mists still made them\nuncomfortable.\nThere, Wax thought, picking out an open window on the second floor.\nVery good, Bleeder said, and Wax saw something shift just inside the\nwindow, ambient light barely sufficient to let him discern it. Ever the\ndetective.\n“I’m not much of one, actually,” Wax said. “In the Roughs, you solve\nfewer cases with investigation than with a good pair of guns.”\nThat’s a fun lie, Bleeder said. Do you tell that one at parties to youths\nwho’ve read too many stories about the Roughs? They don’t like hearing\nabout interrogating family members of a man gone bad? Tracking down\ngunsmiths to see who fixed an outlaw’s rifle? Digging through an old\ncampfire after days spent on the road?\n“How do you know about things like that?” Wax asked.\nI do my homework. It’s a kandra thing, which I assume MeLaan"

Whatever you claim, you’re a good investigator. Maybe an\nexcellent one. Even if you are, by definition, a dog chasing its own tail.\nWax walked right up to the base of the building, the mist thinning\nbetween him and Bleeder, who skulked just inside the window about ten\nfeet up. Her face, though enveloped by the shadows, seemed wrong to Wax.\nShaped oddly.\n“Have you asked him?” Bleeder whispered from above, barely audible\nin the night. She had a rasping, dry voice, like the one in his head.\n“Who?”\n“Harmony. Have you asked why he didn’t save Lessie? A whisper at the\nright time, telling you not to split up. A warning in the back of your mind,\ntelling you not to prowl down that tunnel, but instead circle around behind?\nYou could have saved Lessie so easily with his help.”\n“Don’t speak her name,” Wax hissed.\n“He’s supposed to be God. He could have snapped his fingers and made\nTan drop dead on the spot. He didn’t. Have you asked why?”\nVindication was in Wax’s hand a moment later, pointing up toward that\nwindow. His other hand felt at his gunbelt for the pouch that held the\nsyringes.\nBleeder chuckled. “Ever quick with the gun. If you speak to Harmony\nagain, ask him. Did he know the effect Lessie had on you, that she was what\nkept you out in the Roughs? Did he know, perhaps, that you’d never return\nhere—where he needed you—as long as she was alive? Did he, perhaps,\nwant her to die?”\nWax fired.\nNot to hit Bleeder. He just needed to hear a crack in the night. That\nsound, so familiar, of breaking air. The bullet left a trail in the mist, and the\nwall beside Bleeder popped, scattering flakes of brick.\nRusts … he was shaking.\n“I’m sorry,” Bleeder whispered. “For what I have to do. Cleaning the\nwound is often more painful than the cut itself. You will see, and\nunderstand, once you are free.”\n“No, we—”\nThe mists churned. Wax stumbled back, swinging his gun toward\nsomething that had passed in a blur, leaving a corridor of swirling mist.\nBleeder. Moving with Feruchemical speed.\nToward the governor.\nWax cursed, swinging Vindication behind himself and planting a bullet\nin the ground, then Pushing in a powerful burst. He launched through the\nmists toward the blazing light of the governor’s grounds, sweeping over the\ngates, startling a small flock of ravens, which scattered into the air around\nhim.\nTwo shots rang out in the night. As Wax crossed the grounds, he spotted\nBleeder on the mansion’s front steps, wearing a body-length scarlet coat.\nThe guards at the front doors lay dead at her feet. In the glow of the electric\nlights, he could see what was wrong with Bleeder’s face now—she wore a\nblack-and-white mask. The Marksman’s mask, but twisted, broken up one\nside."

The Marksman’s mask, but twisted, broken up one\nside.\nShe ducked into the building, not using her speed any longer. Wax\nlanded beside the bodies—he didn’t have time to check them for life—and\ngrowled as he shoved into the building, gun out, and checked right, then\nleft. The house steward screamed, dropping a tray of tea in the entryway as\nBleeder skidded across the floor and into the next room.\nWax followed, the main door ripping from its frame and flying out\nbehind him into the night as he Pushed against it and its hinges to cross the\nroom in a half run, half skim. He burst into the next chamber—a sitting\nroom—with Vindication out, spinning the cylinder to one of the gun’s\nspecial hazekiller rounds. A Thug shot, extra-heavy slug, built to deliver as\nmuch force as possible.\nThe room he entered was decorated with the kind of perfect furniture\nyou found only in a house that had too many rooms. According to the\nblueprint he’d been given, under it would be the saferoom.\nStill the gun, Bleeder said in his mind as she leaped over a sofa, heading\ntoward the wall, which hid the steps down to the saferoom. Useless. I\ncannot be killed with that.\nWax raised Vindication and sighted, then fired, Pushing the bullet\nforward in a burst of extra speed. It hit Bleeder as she landed.\nRight in the ankle.\nThe bone shattered and Bleeder collapsed as she tried to put weight on\nher ankle. She turned toward Wax, lips raised in a snarl visible through the\nbroken side of the mask.\nWax put a bullet through the eyehole in the mask.\nThis is meaningless—\nHe strode forward, shooting her in the hand as she tried to raise her gun.\nWax pulled out the syringe, ready to Push it toward her skin, but she\ngrowled and became a blur. Wax tried to follow that blur—but at that\nmoment, the side of the room burst open, revealing the hidden stairwell. A\ngroup of men in black suits and shotguns piled out, frantic. The governor’s\nspecial security.\nWax dove for cover as they started firing. He didn’t catch much of what\nhappened next, as he put his back to the side of a thick chair. Bleeder\nmoved among the men, firing. They tried to fire back, doing more damage\nto their friends than they did to her.\nIt was over by the time the report from the first gunshot had faded in\nWax’s ears. Men lay groaning and bleeding on the floor, and Bleeder was\nthrough the hole and heading down the steps. Wax set his jaw and Pushed\nhimself across the room. He landed, skidding on blood, and leaped into the\nstairwell. Another Push sent him soaring down the steps.\nGunshots resounded in the narrow confines of the stairwell, coming\nfrom just ahead. Wax slowed himself with a shot forward into the ground,\nlanding beside a final handful of guards who lay bleeding on the floor.\nThe kandra stood alone before the door to the saferoom. She looked at\nWax, smiled, and became a blur."

She looked at\nWax, smiled, and became a blur.\nBut her speed only lasted a fraction of a second. Soon after she’d begun\ntapping her metalmind, she slowed back down.\nWax caught sight of her just as she unlocked the door to the governor’s\nsaferoom, using a key she shouldn’t have. She pulled the door open with a\nflourish, then glanced back at Wax, shaking her head. She obviously\nthought she was still a blur moving with incredible speed. And she was.\nWax had simply joined her.\nOne of the fallen bodies stirred, and Wayne pushed back his hat,\nshowing a grin. Wax raised his hands, a gun in each, and was rewarded by\nan expression of utter shock on Bleeder’s face. She’d regrown her eye,\nthough blood still streamed down the front of her mask. As he had chased\nher, talked to her, she’d always seemed fully in control.\nUntil this moment.\nWax blasted away with both guns. That wasn’t usually a good idea, at\nleast if you wanted to hit anything, but they were barely ten feet apart—and\nbesides, he was inside a speed bubble. His bullets would refract when\nleaving sped-up time, and so aiming was of questionable value anyway.\nAt a time like this, you didn’t want to be precise. You wanted to be\nthorough. Steris would be proud.\nHe fired in a cacophony, empting both weapons. He took advantage of\nBleeder’s shock, dropping his guns and pulling his other Sterrion out of its\nunder-arm holster and unloading it. His short-barreled shotgun, from the\nholster on his thigh, followed, belching slugs and thunder as Wax strode to\nthe edge of the speed bubble.\nAfter reaching the rim, the bullets deflected out into normal time,\nmoving painfully slowly. But less than a foot separated Bleeder and the\nedge of Wayne’s bubble. Wax dropped the shotgun and pulled out one of the\nsyringes again, and shoved it toward her, Pushing on the metal, hoping\nagainst hope that—stunned from the gunfire—she wouldn’t notice it\ncoming.\nAs the kandra turned to run, the first bullet hit. Others followed in a\nstorm. Half missed, but Wax had fired almost two dozen shots. Many\npunched into Bleeder, who dropped her Feruchemical speed as they caught\nher. She moved lethargically, trying to escape the hail of bullets, sprays of\nblood bursting silently into the air, like the seeds blown from a dandelion.\nShe stumbled against the doorframe, and one of the shotgun slugs hit the\nback of her head, ripping a hole through her face and breaking off the mask.\nShe sagged, gripping the doorframe, draped in her red cloak.\nThe needle flew from Wax’s Push, spinning in the air, but it—like the\nbullets—had been deflected by the edge of the speed bubble.

She did flip the needle off the frame, sending it toppling in slow\nmotion toward the ground.\nWax dug a handful of rounds from the pouch on his belt, then leaped out\nof the speed bubble. He felt an immediate lurch—as if the world had been\nupended—and heard a faint popping sound. The nausea hit him like a punch\nto the face, but he was ready for it. He’d ducked out of speed bubbles\nbefore.\nA single gunshot sounded from the saferoom.\nHe crossed the distance to the door in a rush, throwing the cartridges in\nfront of himself, ready to Push on the ones that he might need to hit\nBleeder. Once inside, however, he let the rounds drop to the ground.\nBleeder wasn’t in the room; an open door at the back led out, presumably\nthrough a tunnel to the grounds above.\nThe plush saferoom—round and rimmed with bookshelves—had a wet\nbar on one end and was lit by comfortable reading lamps. The governor\nknelt on the floor, holding a bleeding Drim, frantically trying to stanch the\nblood coming from the bodyguard’s neck.\nWax dashed across the room, stopping at the door into the escape tunnel.\n“Lawman!” Innate cried. “Help. Please … oh, Harmony. Help!”\nWax hesitated, peering into that empty, dark tunnel. He was reminded of\nanother one like it, dusty and shored up by beams at the sides. Both a tomb\nand a stage …\nBehind, Wayne stumbled into the room, then scrambled to help Innate.\nWax remained by the door into the tunnel, rolling a few rounds between his\nfingers.\n“He saved me,” Innate said, weeping. By this point, he was drenched in\nDrim’s blood. He’d pulled off his shirt, trying to use it to stanch the blood.\n“He leaped into the way right as the assassin shot,” Innate said. “Tell me\nyou can … Please…”\n“He’s gone, mate,” Wayne said, settling back.\n“Other casualties upstairs, Wayne,” Wax said, pointing. With reluctance,\nhe shut the door to the escape tunnel. He couldn’t give chase, not and leave\nthe governor alone here.\nWayne rushed out of the room to check on the men who had been shot\nupstairs. Wax walked over to the governor, who knelt before his\nbodyguard’s corpse. He’d never seen Innate look so human as he did at that\nmoment, shoulders slumped, head bowed. Exhausted, wrung-out. Could\nanyone fake that?\nHe checked anyway. “Leavening on sand,” Wax said.\nInnate looked up at him, eyes unfocused. Wax’s heart skipped a beat,\nbut then the governor sighed. “Bones without soup.”\nHe knew the passphrase. This was really Innate.\nWax knelt beside the governor, looking over Drim’s corpse. Annoying\nthough the man had been at times, he had not deserved this. “I’m sorry.”\n“She stopped moving at a blur,” Innate said, his voice strained. “She\nappeared inside, gun out, but seemed angry about something.

She was gone a second later. Surely she could\nhave paused to finish me off, rather than running.”\n“She obtained Feruchemical powers only two weeks ago,” Wax said.\n“That time frame greatly limits how much speed she can have stored up,\nand moving as fast as she has been must have drained her metalmind\nquickly. She needed to escape before it ran out.”\nOf course, there could be another reason. She might have just wanted to\nfrighten them, and the governor. To prod him to do something. But what?\nShe said she intended to kill him, but not until the time was right.\nWhy? What was the plan?\n“So she’s flawed,” Innate said. “She can be beaten.”\n“Of course she can,” Wax said. He looked down at the corpse, and the\nfloor stained red. But at what cost? He took a deep breath. “I want you to\nleave the city.”\n“No.”\n“That’s stupidity,” Wax snapped. “She will be back.”\n“Have you looked out there, lawman?” Innate said, waving a bloody\nhand in a vaguely upward direction. “Have you seen what’s happening in\nthis city?”\n“You can’t do anything about that tonight.”\n“I most certainly can.” Innate stood. “I’m the leader of this city; I’m not\ngoing to run away. If anything, I need to be seen—need to meet with the\nchief instigators of this movement, if any can be found. I need to address\nthe crowds, prepare a speech—I need to gather my cabinet, and with them\nmake sure that there’s still a city here in the morning.” He pointed at Wax.\n“You stop this creature, Ladrian. I don’t have a bodyguard any longer. I’m\nin your hands.”\nHe strode out then. Whatever else he thought of the man, Wax had to\nrespect Innate’s grit.\nYou stop this creature.…\nWax glanced at the syringe, still lying on the floor near the doorframe.\nSo close. If it had hit, he might have been able to depress the metal plunger\nand send the liquid into her veins. Feeling powerless, he fetched that\nsyringe and brought it back to Drim’s corpse, dead with a bullet right in the\nneck. Wax plunged the syringe into the corpse’s arm and emptied it into the\nflesh.\nNothing happened. He hadn’t expected it to—it seemed very\nimplausible that Bleeder would have managed to get Drim’s face on and\nfool the governor this way. But it still made Wax feel more comfortable.\nHe stumbled to his feet. Rusts, he was tired. Why hadn’t she killed the\ngovernor? There was more to this.\nWayne peeked in. “Two guards might make it. We have a surgeon\nhelpin’ them now.”\n“Good,” Wax said. “Wait for me upstairs.”\nWayne nodded, ducking back out. Wax instead walked to the escape\nroute and pulled open the door.

What did undermining the governor, inciting a\nriot against the Pathians, and Wax’s own “freedom” have to do with one\nanother? What was he missing?\nHe didn’t find Bleeder in the tunnel, though halfway up it he found her\nred cloak. She’d tossed it, bloodied, to the side. There, scrawled on the wall,\nwas a crude picture shaped like a man, drawn with a fingernail into the\nwood.\nDabs of dried blood marked the figure’s eyes, and another marked its\nmouth. The words scrawled beneath in blood gave Wax a chill.\nI rip out his tongue to stop the lies.\nI stab out his eyes to hide from his gaze.\nYou will be free.\n17\nAbout a half hour after Bleeder’s attack, Wayne walked into the governor’s\nfancy washroom. Only in his head it wasn’t the washroom. He just knew to\ncall it that here.\nYou see, Wayne had figured out the code.\nRich folks, they had this code. All of them knew it, and they used it like\na new language to weed out everyone who didn’t belong.\nRegular folk, they called something after what it was.\nYou’d say, “What’s that, Kell?”\nAnd they’d say, “That? That there’s the crapper.”\nAnd you’d reply, “What do you do with it?”\nAnd they’d say, “Well, Wayne, that’s where you put your crap.”\nIt made sense. But rich folk, they had a different word for the crapper.\nThey’d call it a “commode” or a “washroom.” That way, when someone\nasked for the crapper, they knew it was a person they needed to oppress.\nWayne did his business and spat his gum into the bowl before flushing.\nIt felt good to be wearing his own hat again, dueling canes at his waist.\nHe’d spent a good hour or two wearing the clothing and false face of a\nguard for Innate. Horribly uncomfortable, that.\nHe wiped his sniffly nose and washed his hands, drying them on towels\nembroidered with Innate’s name. He was that worried people would run off\nwith his towels? Well, the joke was on him. Wayne was perfectly happy to\nwipe up dirt with the governor’s name. He tucked the towel into his pocket,\nand left in trade a few mints he’d taken from the bar.\nHe wandered out from there, peeking into the room where the governor\nwas holding a meeting with all kinds of important folks, the type who called\nthe crapper “the facilities.”\nYou know, he thought, maybe I have it wrong. Maybe it’s not code.\nMaybe they’re just so familiar with what comes out of their arses, normal\nwords aren’t specific enough. Like how the Terris language had seven\ndifferent words for iron.\nHe nodded to himself. A new theory. Wax was gonna love this one.\nWayne passed into the room with the couches, where the guards had been\ngunned down. Wax stood inside with an envelope, into which he dropped\nsomething small and metallic. He sealed it, then handed it to a young\nmessenger from the governor’s staff."

He sealed it, then handed it to a young\nmessenger from the governor’s staff.\n“Deliver it quickly,” Wax said. “Pound on the door. Wake her up if you\nhave to—and don’t get scared off if she cusses at you or threatens to shoot\nyou. She won’t actually hurt you.”\nThe young man nodded, though he’d gone pale.\n“Tell her it’s urgent,” Wax said, holding up his finger. “Don’t let her toss\nit aside and read it in the morning. You stay there until she’s read what I\nwrote, you understand?”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“Good lad. Off with you.”\nThe youth ran out. Wayne strolled over to Wax, passing the open door\ndown to the saferoom. The bodies around it had been removed, though the\nblood remained.\n“Ranette?” Wayne asked hopefully.\nWax nodded. “I thought of something that might help.”\n“I coulda delivered that, you know.…”\n“You, she would shoot,” Wax said.\n“Only ’cuz she likes me,” Wayne said, smiling. He’d have welcomed an\nexcuse to go see Ranette. This night was getting darker and darker, it\nseemed.\n“Wayne…” Wax said. “You know she doesn’t actually like you.”\n“You always say that, but you’re just not seein’ the truth, Wax.”\n“She tries to kill you.”\n“To keep me alive,” Wayne said. “She knows I live a dangerous life. So,\nkeepin’ me on my toes is the best way to make sure I stick around. Anyway,\nwas that Marasi I saw in there with the governor and his important folk?”\nWax nodded. “She and MeLaan arrived a short time back. Aradel wants\nto declare martial law.”\n“And you don’t?” Wayne asked, taking a seat on one of the nice couches\nthat didn’t have much blood splattered on it. Important people were meeting\nnearby. He suspected he knew what would come next, and he intended to\nwait around for it.\nWax stood for a moment, then shook his head. “Bleeder set this all up,\nWayne. She’s been pushing us toward this. ‘I rip out his tongue … I stab out\nhis eyes…’”\n“Now, I’m as for dismemberment as the next fellow,” Wayne said, “but\nthat’s a mite violent for this time of day.”\n“Bleeder wrote it on the wall down below. A poem of some sort. It\ndoesn’t feel finished to me.”\n“She nailed that priest through the eyes,” Wayne noted.\n“And ripped out Winsting’s tongue,” Wax said. He fished in his pocket\nand brought something out, tossing it to Wayne.\n“What’s this?” Wayne asked, turning it over in his fingers. It was a piece\nof painted wood.\n“Remains of the Marksman’s mask. Bleeder was wearing it.”\n“You think she was him all along?” Wayne asked.\n“Maybe,” Wax said. “It would have served her purpose, riling up the\npeople of the slums, reminding them how rich the houses are.

We’re missing something very important.”\nWayne nodded, but was hardly listening. Wax would figure it out.\nWayne just needed to get some shuteye, while the getting was still good\nenough for …\nHe heard a door click open. He threw back his hat and was on his feet a\nsecond later, scrambling for the door. Wax cursed, pulling out one of his\nguns, following as Wayne dashed into the hallway and intercepted the\nservant with a plate full of little party foods.\n“Aha!” Wayne said. “Thought you could slip by me, didja!”\nThe kitchen maid looked horrified as Wayne gathered up three of each\nof the treats. Wax stopped in the doorway, then lowered his gun. “Oh, for\nHarmony’s sake.”\n“Harmony can get his own,” Wayne said, popping a little cake in his\nmouth. As he turned back to Wax, the maid scuttled away, heading for the\nmeeting.\nIt was exactly what Wayne had been waiting for. Important folk meeting\ntogether always meant snacks. Or canapés, if you knew the code. Wayne\npopped one in his mouth—candied bacon wrapped around a walnut.\n“How is it?” Wax asked.\n“Tastes like cotton candy,” Wayne said, relishing the flavor, “made of\nbaby.”\n“I did not need to hear that,” Wax said, slipping his gun back into its\nholster. “I’m going to need to go back out there, see if I can figure out\nBleeder’s plan. That leaves you here to protect the governor again.”\nWayne nodded. “I’ll do what I can, but that’s a tall order, mate.”\n“I’ve arranged for some help,” Wax said, leading the way over to the\nladies’ crapper. He knocked on the door.\n“Still changing!” MeLaan’s voice came from inside.\n“How long?” Wax said.\nThe door cracked, and a woman’s face peeked out that looked\ncompletely unlike MeLaan’s. “Not long,” she said in MeLaan’s voice. “This\nlady’s hair was a real pain.” She shut the door."

We’ll keep her on the governor’s guard staff, and hopefully Bleeder\nwill be so busy looking for you and me that she’ll miss MeLaan.”\n“I hope you appreciate this,” the kandra’s voice came from inside the\ncrapper. “I hate being short. As a side note, this lady tasted awful. Far too\nlean and tough.” The door cracked, revealing the face again. “Next time,\nchoose a body that’s been sitting around awhile, would you? Nice and aged\nis the best flavor for…”\nShe trailed off, looking from Wayne to Wax, noticing their expressions.\n“Oh right,” she said. “Mortals.

I’m almost ready; just have to get the clothing on. How is\nthe hair?”\n“Good,” Wayne said. “I think you forgot an eyebrow though.”\nMeLaan felt at her face. “Hell,” she said. “This is what you get by\nforcing me to work so quickly.” She ducked back into the room.\n“Speaking of quickly,” Wax said through the door, “is this about what I\ncan expect with Bleeder? A half hour to change bodies?”\nWayne nodded. That would be useful to know.\n“No, unfortunately,” MeLaan’s voice said from inside, muffled. It was\nstill the same voice as she’d had in her other body. Was she going to change\nthat? “Paalm is old-generation, very practiced. I don’t think anybody is as\ngood as TenSoon, mind you, but Paalm will be fast—particularly swapping\ninto a body she’s used before. I’ve known early-generationers who can\nchange bodies in under ten minutes, and that’s going in blind.”\n“Isn’t that tough?” Wayne called. “Like … I once hadda eat twenty\nsausages for a bet.

She\nwas also smiling. “You’re cute,” she noted to Wayne. “How’s my\neyebrow?”\n“Uh, good.” Cute? “But I’m taken.”\n“In answer to your question,” MeLaan said, “it is hard, but not for the\nreason you’re implying. We can force-feed and expel excess, which makes\ndoing the transformation near a drain like in here convenient. The tough\npart is memorizing the muscle patterns as you digest them. That and getting\nthe hair right. You people are practically drowning in the stuff. Fortunately,\nfor a quick change like this, I can ignore the hair under the clothing.”\n“So … wait,” Wayne said, rubbing his chin. “You’re saying we might be\nable to check if a person is a kandra by…”\n“… Seeing if they put leg and arm hair on?” MeLaan asked. “That\nmight actually work, but only if the kandra had to change fast.”\n“Arm hair,” Wayne said. “Right. I was thinkin’ of arm hair.”\n“That is the most difficult part to get right on short notice,” MeLaan\nsaid. “We can’t make hair, so we’ve got to use your own, and place each\nstrand in a pore. Arms and legs have thousands of the things. What a pain.\nFar worse than a mass on the head or whatnot.”\n“MeLaan,” Wax said, digging in his coat pocket and bringing something\nout. “Do you recognize this?”\n“I don’t have a lot to go on, chief, but I’d say it’s an empty glass vial.”\n“Take it inside and turn off the lights,” Wax said, tossing her the vial as\nWayne stepped forward, trying to get a look. That stuff seemed interesting.\nMeLaan withdrew, then shoved open the door a second later. She\ngrabbed Wax by the mistcoat, somehow still imposing despite the fact that\nshe was now shorter than either of them. “Where did you get this?”\n“Bottom of Bleeder’s robes,” Wax said. “The ones she was wearing to\nimitate a priest.”\n“This is perchwither,” MeLaan said. “It’s a bioluminescent fungus. It\ngrows in only one place.”\n“Where?” Wax asked.\n“The kandra Homeland.”\nWax looked deflated. “Oh. So that’s where we’d expect her to be going,\nright?”\n“No,” MeLaan said. “The kandra are no longer trapped there. We move\nin society—we have homes, lives. If we want to meet up with others of our\nkind, we catch them at the pub. The Homeland is a monument. A holy site.\nA place of relics. The fact that she’s been there recently, wearing the body\nof someone she killed…” MeLaan shivered visibly, letting go of Wax. “It’s\nnauseating.”\n“I should check it out,” Wax said. “She might be staying down there.”\nMeLaan folded her arms, looking him over. “Harmony says it’s okay,”"

We don’t use that entrance very often, but it’s probably\neasiest for you. Just don’t break anything, lawman.”\n“I’ll do my best,” Wax said, turning as a footman peeked in from the\nhallway, then approached with a small silver tray bearing a card.\n“Lord Ladrian?” said the footman, holding out the tray. “Your coach has\narrived.”\n“Coach?” Wayne asked. On a hunt, Wax was usually in full-on “fly\nthrough the city like a rusting vulture” mode. Why would he need a coach?\nWax picked up the card on the tray, then nodded and took a deep breath.\n“Thank you.” He turned to Wayne and MeLaan. “Keep the governor alive.\nI’ll send word if I discover anything.”\n“So what’s in the coach?” Wayne asked.\n“I sent a note soon after I got here to the mansion,” Wax said. “There’s\none person in this city who might have an inkling of what Bleeder is up to.”\nWax’s face took on a grim cast.\nAh, of course, Wayne thought. He patted Wax on the shoulder. This\nwouldn’t be a pleasant meeting.\n“Who?” MeLaan asked, looking from Wayne back to Wax. “What are\nyou talking about?”\n“Have you ever heard,” Wax said, “of a group called the Set?”\n* * *\nWax found his uncle waiting comfortably inside the coach. No bodyguards.\nThe coachman didn’t even ask for Wax’s weapons as he stopped at the door.\nContacting his uncle had been easy; the appointment book had listed a few\nof Edwarn’s safe-deposit boxes, kept under false names. After posting\nwatch on one for a few weeks, Wax had found a letter inside, suggesting he\ntry something else.\nHe’d left his own letter. After that, one had appeared for him. They\nnever said anything useful, and Wax had driven himself crazy trying to find\nout how they were being placed. But Edwarn seemed to know the moment a\nnew one from Wax arrived.\nWax took a deep breath, then climbed into the coach. Edwarn was a\nstocky man distinguished by a short, precisely trimmed beard, a beautifully\ntailored suit, and a cravat so narrow and thin, it lay flat like a bowtie\nloosened at the end of a long night. Edwarn’s hands rested easily on the\nornate head of a cane, and his face bore a wide smile.\n“Nephew!” he said as Wax settled into his seat. “You can’t imagine my\njoy upon receiving your note, and with a promise that you wouldn’t try to\narrest me. So quaint! I came immediately; I feel like we’ve been too distant\nlately.”\n“Distant? You tried to have me killed.”\n“And you’ve tried to return the favor!” Edwarn said, knocking with his\ncane on the roof to get the coach moving. “Yet here we sit, both alive and"

I see no reason why we can’t be amiable. We are rivals, yes, but also\nstill family.”\n“You’re a criminal, Uncle,” Wax said. “Considering the things you’ve\ndone, I don’t feel much familial empathy.”\nEdwarn sighed, slipping his pipe from his pocket. “Can’t you at least try\nto be pleasant?”\n“I’ll try.” Truth was, Wax wanted information from this man.\nAntagonizing him would not be smart.\nThey rolled on silently for a while as Edwarn lit the pipe, and Wax tried\nto organize his thoughts. How to approach this?\n“Dangerous night,” Edwarn noted, nodding out the window as they\npassed a group of men and women holding aloft lanterns and torches while\nlistening to a woman standing on a stack of boxes. She shouted into the\nmists angry words that Wax couldn’t quite make out. Rusts, that group was\nclose to the governor’s mansion. He hoped that Innate and the constables\ncould get this under control.\n“I wonder,” Edwarn said, puffing on his pipe, “if that night long ago felt\nthe same as this one—the night when the Survivor’s Gambit played out.\nThe fall of a regime. The start of a new world.”\n“You can’t possibly think this is equivalent,” Wax said. “The Lord\nRuler’s reign was one of terror and oppression. These people are upset, yes,\nbut it’s a far different world now.”\n“Different?” Edwarn said, letting smoke roll from his mouth as he\nspoke. “Perhaps. But human emotions are the same. It seems that no matter\nhow nice the box is, put a man inside it and he will buck. Fight. Rail.”\n“And you claim to be on the side of the common man,” Wax said dryly.\n“Hardly. I want power. Wealth. Influence. Just like the people in the\nSurvivor’s crew, actually.”\n“They were heroes.”\n“And thieves.”\n“They were what they had to be.”\n“And Kelsier himself?” Edwarn said. “In the years before his grand\ngambit? What of the Ascendant Warrior, living on the street, scamming\nnoblemen and priests for a living? Have you read the Words of Founding,\nNephew? The Historica speaks frankly about their ambitions. The Survivor\ndidn’t just want to overthrow the Lord Ruler; he wanted to steal the\nempire’s riches. He wanted to rule the world that came about upon the Lord\nRuler’s fall. He wanted power. Influence. Wealth.”\n“I’m not going down this road, Uncle,” Wax said.\n“Have you ever wondered,” Edwarn mused, ignoring Wax’s objection,\n“if you’d get along with them? If you’d lived back then, what would you\nhave seen? A bunch of miscreants? Lawbreakers? Would you have trussed\nup the Ascendant Warrior and tossed her in a cell? The law is not something\nholy, son. It’s just a reflection of the ideals of those lucky enough to be in\ncharge.”\n“I don’t know any constables,” Wax said, “who think the law is perfect"

But they’re the best damn things we have right now,\nand I’m not going to entertain for a second the idea that you’re some kind\nof secret seeker of justice. You’re as rotten as they come, Uncle.”\n“So pleasant,” Edwarn said. “And this is what I get for responding to\nyour invitation? Insults and vitriol. And one wonders why our house is\nconsidered a laughingstock these days. I’m told they invite you to parties\njust to see you strut.”\n“I sent to you,” Wax said through clenched teeth, “because I think we\nmight have a common enemy. I know you want to rule this city. Well, I\nneed you to see reason. I’ve spoken with the creature. If we don’t stop her,\nthere might not be a city to rule.”\nEdwarn didn’t respond, holding his pipe and looking through the\ncoach’s glass window at the curling mists in the darkness just outside.\n“What do you know?” Wax asked, almost a plea. “I’m certain the Set\nhas been watching events with interest. Your attempt to kill me earlier—tell\nme that was just a strike of opportunity. Tell me you aren’t working with\nher. She’ll see it all burn, Uncle. Help me bring her down.”\nEdwarn mused silently awhile, enjoying his pipe. “Do you realize what\nyour overzealous campaign against us has accomplished, Nephew?” he\nfinally asked. “Half the city’s elements are too frightened to work with the\nSet, for fear that you’ll show up on their doorstep and shoot their mothers.\nThe money you’ve seized hasn’t ruined us, but it has made some of our\nmembers very, very upset.”\n“Good,” Wax said.\n“You say that because you’re ignorant,” Edwarn spat. “Among the\nmembers of the Set, I am conservative. I speak against brashness, against\nviolence. The more you shove, however, the weaker my influence becomes,\nand stronger grow the voices clamoring for change. At any cost.”\n“Oh, Harmony,” Wax whispered. “You are working with her.”\n“It’s more like we’re riding the storm,” Edwarn said. “Personally, I’d\nlove to see you bring this creature down. It might topple some of my rivals,\ngive me a chance to propose something audacious of my own to the Set.\nBut I’m not going to help you, Nephew. Perhaps this is what needs to be.”\n“How can you do this?” Wax asked. “You’re going to watch it all burn?”\n“Ashes are excellent fertilizer,” Edwarn said.\n“Unless they pile so high they smother everything.”\nEdwarn drew his lips to a tight line. “You are shortsighted and self-\nrighteous. You were ever so, even during your youth. But still I love you,\nNephew. I consider it a sign of that love that I haven’t actually had you\nkilled. I keep hoping you’ll see we are not your enemy. We are the thieves\nand miscreants of this day who will someday be hailed as heroes. The men\nand women who will change the world because … what was it you said?…"

Kill me, and your\nsister is as good as dead, Waxillium.” He knocked again on the ceiling\nbeneath the driver. The carriage slowed to a stop.\n“Run along now,” Edwarn said. “Go be the toy soldier and pretend you\nwouldn’t have murdered the Survivor’s entire crew, if you’d lived under the\nLord Ruler. Try to pretend you went out into the Roughs to find justice, and\nnot because you realized life in this city was just too damn hard for you.”\nThey sat in the quiet, immobile coach. Wax held himself steady, though\nEdwarn’s eyes flicked toward Wax’s shoulder holster, as if he was expecting\nWax to draw. He could. He could shoot this man right here and now—he’d\nbroken promises before, and to far better men than his uncle.\nKill me, and your sister is as good as dead.…\nWax kicked the door open. “I’m going to go deal with this kandra, but\nknow that I won’t forget you, Uncle. One day you’re going to find me\nstanding behind you with a gun to your head, and you’ll have the sudden,\nhorrible realization that there’s nothing left that can protect you.”\n“I look forward to it!” Edwarn said. “If that day doesn’t come before\nnext summer, you should join me for Mareweather dinner. We’ll have\nstuffed pig in your honor.”\nWax growled softly, but stepped from the coach and slammed the door.\n18\nMarasi had spent a great portion of her adult life preparing to be an\nattorney, and her mother had wished her to someday find her way to\npolitics. Marasi had abandoned aspirations toward politics in her youth, and\nhad recently abandoned the solicitors as well. The thing was, those\nprofessions had one important flaw: They were populated entirely with\nattorneys and politicians.\nDespite her best efforts she now found herself in a room full of them.\nGovernor Innate stood by the hearth here, in his private study, one arm\nresting on the mantel. Arrayed before him were the men and women of his\nexecutive staff, a hearty bunch who didn’t seem nearly as groggy as the\nconstables and guards who had been called up in the middle of the night.\nIn fact, the group displayed a distinct energy as they discussed the crisis.\nTheir words tumbled over one another in their eagerness to express their\nopinions, like children vying for parental approval. Marasi stood beside the\nwindow—where the governor had put her, saying he’d get to her later. So\nshe waited, listened, and circumspectly took notes on her pad. If the kandra\nhappened to be hiding among them, she doubted a verbal slip would enable\nher to recognize Bleeder, but it seemed the best use of her time as long as\nshe was required to stay put."

He was an\nattorney who had been through the same program she’d completed, albeit\nmany years ago. Marasi wasn’t sure why he needed a law degree to run city\nsanitation. “Rep, you’re taking this too seriously.”\n“I am taking an attempt on my life too seriously?” Innate asked. “An\nattack that left one of my lifelong friends dead?”\nThat brought a stillness to the room, and the sanitation director settled\nback down, red-faced. Innate had changed his shirt from the one stained red\nwith blood, but Marasi knew they all had seen him before he’d done so. She\nrather thought he’d delayed changing until they had.\n“I wasn’t talking about the assassination attempt,” the sanitation director\nsaid. “I meant the ruckus outside. It will blow over.”\n“They’re already looting,” the minister of trade noted, a bespectacled\nwoman who had brought two aides to take notes for her. She hadn’t offered\nthem seats.\n“There will always be looting,” the sanitation director said. “It happens.\nWe hunker down, let burn what needs to burn. Contain, rather than try to\nstamp out.”\n“Foolishness,” said the secretary of education, a corpulent woman who\nsat with her feet up by the crackling fire. “This is a time for decisiveness,\nmy lord governor. You need to show your rivals that you are not easily\ncowed. You know the Lekals have been getting traction lately, and your\nbrother’s scandal will only fuel their ambition. Mark my words, they will\npresent a strong candidate to rival you at the next election, and he will lean\non this night’s events to discredit you.”\n“Yes,” said the minister of public affairs. “Could they be behind the\nassassination attempt, perhaps?”\nThe governor glanced toward Marasi—the first time he’d acknowledged\nher since the meeting had begun. He knew about MeLaan now; she’d\nshown her true nature to him just before the meeting started. He believed,\nand had begun by explaining to the executive staff about the rogue kandra.\nThe others obviously considered it foolishness and, after the way of their\nkind, were simply ignoring what he’d told them.\nMarasi met his gaze calmly. Once upon a time she had dreamed of being\na participant in meetings like this one. Gatherings where important\ndecisions were made, where laws were drafted and political strategies\nadopted. Now, she found herself frustrated by all the talk. Waxillium was\nrubbing off on her, and perhaps not in ways she should appreciate.\n“No, no,” the sanitation director said. “The Lekals aren’t behind this. An\nassassin? Are you mad, Donton? They would never be caught engaging in\nsomething so potentially damaging.”\n“Agreed,” said the secretary of education. “This was someone far more\ndesperate. I repeat, my lord governor. Decisiveness. Leadership. You asked\nabout martial law? Well, that is the minimum you must do, I say. Send the\nconstables out in force. Crush the looters, scatter the rioters, be seen\nprotecting the city.”"

Crush the looters, scatter the rioters, be seen\nprotecting the city.”\nOthers voiced their opinions on this, and the governor quieted them.\n“I’ll consider. I’ll consider.” His tone was sharp, sharper than Marasi had\nheard from him before. “Out with you all. I need to think.”\nIn that moment he looked haggard. The counselors quieted, then made\ntheir way out. Marasi moved to join them, reluctantly.\n“Miss Colms,” the governor said, walking to his desk, “a moment.”\nMarasi obeyed, stepping up before the desk as he settled down. He\nreached to the floor, pushing back the rug and exposing the top of a small\nsafe, which he absently unlocked with a key from his desk. He reached\ninside, taking out his seal of office, then settled down to begin writing.\n“Tell Constable-General Aradel that he has his writ of martial law,” the\ngovernor said tiredly. “He’s the only constable-general to contact me so far,\nwhich I find disturbing. I am appointing him with executive authority as\nlord high constable, director of all law-enforcement offices in the city until\nthis crisis is over. The other octants’ constables-general will need to report\nto him.”\nMarasi didn’t reply. The others weren’t going to like that. The rivalry\namong the octant precincts was officially characterized as friendly, but in\nreality had far too much bite to it for her taste. “And your instructions\nregarding the people of the city?” Marasi asked softly as he wrote. “Should\nthe constables do as your education secretary suggests?”\nInnate finished writing. He looked up at her, and seemed to weigh her\nwith his eyes. “You’re new to the constabulary, I believe? The … cousin of\nLord Ladrian’s betrothed?”\n“I wasn’t aware I’d attracted your attention,” Marasi said.\n“You haven’t. He has. Damnable man.”\nMarasi remained silent, feeling awkward before his judgmental gaze.\n“Those mobs will end up here sooner or later, you know,” the governor\nsaid, tapping his pen on the table. “They’ll come demanding answers. I\nmust speak to them, turn this tide.”\nSpeak to them? Marasi thought. As you did earlier? That speech hadn’t\nshown any particular sense of empathy.\nRusts, had that only been this afternoon? Checking the governor’s\nornate desk clock, she found it was almost two—so the governor’s speech\nhad technically been yesterday. She probably shouldn’t have looked at the\ntime; seeing exactly how late it was merely reminded her of her own\nexhaustion. It was like an angry creditor pounding on her door; she’d be\nable to ignore it for only so long.\n“Tell Aradel,” the governor mused, “not to stop the people from\nconverging here at the mansion, but he is to beat down any looters in other\nparts of the city. Put the fear of the sword into them. I’ll need a force of\nconstables here, of course, to keep the masses who come to me in check,\nbut I do want to speak to them. This will be a night for history to be made.”"

This will be a night for history to be made.”\n“Sir,” Marasi said. “I know a thing or two about the mentality of\ncrowds, if you wish—”\nSomeone outside called for Innate, and he stood in the middle of\nMarasi’s sentence. He shoved the writ toward her, sealed with his stamp,\nthen marched out to deal with the questions.\nMarasi watched him go with a sigh. Hopefully Wayne and that kandra\nwoman would be able to assure his safety. She’d happily see Innate\nincarcerated someday, but she didn’t wish him dead. His assassination\nwould be, among other things, terrible for city morale.\nShe stored the writ beside her pistol in her purse, then walked from the\nroom and slipped through the hallway, where many of the cabinet members\nwere giving orders to aides and accepting cups of steaming black tea from\nhousehold staff. Wayne lounged in a corner, feet up on an end table and\nspinning an expensive gold-and-mahogany pen between his fingers.\nHarmony knew where he’d stolen that.\nUnfortunately, her motor needed a refueling, so she’d have to use more\nmundane methods to run the writ to Aradel. She found the footman and\nordered a carriage.\nThe haggard footman, however, shook his head. “It will be a few\nminutes, miss, before I can dredge up a coach. The executive staff have half\nthe cabs in the city running notes for them, and on a night like this one no\nless…” He glanced meaningfully toward the open door. Outside, the porch\nlights barely penetrated the mists. They curled and danced, almost timid.\nTiny wisps would creep into the entry hall, then vanish almost immediately\nlike steam over a stove.\n“I will wait,” Marasi said. “Thank you.”\nHe seemed pleased by her response; perhaps others had been less\nunderstanding. As he was called away, Marasi idled in the doorway, staring\ninto the mists. That orange haze over the city wasn’t normal. Fires were\nburning out there. If they were lucky, those flames would only be massed\nlanterns and torches, not buildings.\nStanding there strongly reminded her of something that she couldn’t put\nher finger on. She shook her head and walked back into the mansion with\nhalf a mind to find Wayne and see what he thought of recent events. In the\nlarge sitting room beyond the entryway, she passed a weary serving man\nscrubbing the wooden floor. The bloodstains were stubborn, it appeared.\nThe man had already discreetly rolled the rug up against the wall for\ndisposal.\nMarasi passed him and, changing her mind about finding Wayne, instead\nwalked down the stairs toward the hidden chamber. A city close to breaking,\nshe thought as she reached the bottom. This has happened before.\nIn the confined space, the air still smelled of the soap that had been used\nto clean up the blood. The empty saferoom had a quiet, scholastic feel about\nit, with all those books on the walls. There was no overhead lighting, just\nthe lamps, shaded a soft red-orange.

The leather-bound books seemed pristine, and on a whim, she pulled\nthe first one out and checked it. The pages were uncut, as sometimes\nhappened in new books. This volume had obviously never been read.\nLong ago the Survivor had pushed a city to the brink of destruction,\nthen channeled that fury into a rebellion that had overthrown a millennium-\nlong dictatorship. Every student learned of those days, but Marasi had read\nthe detailed accounts, including of the night when it had all come to a head.\nShe could imagine it had been a night very much like this one.\nOnly instead of the Survivor, this time it had been induced by a\npsychotic murderer.\nShe has to be doing it on purpose, Marasi thought, walking through the\nroom. Trying to echo that night when the Lord Ruler fell. A people on the\nbrink of insurrection. Noble houses at each other’s throats. And now …\nNow a speech. The governor would have his moment before the crowd,\nand they would sense the resonance even if they couldn’t put their finger on\nit. They’d been taught about that night since childhood. They would listen\nto him, and expect him to be like the Last Emperor, who had spoken long\nago on the night of the Lord Ruler’s death. The Last Emperor had come to\npower because of his heartfelt words that night.\nBut Governor Innate was not Elend Venture. Far from it.\nMarasi suddenly stopped and backed up a few steps. She’d been\nwalking beside the built-in bookcases, paying little conscious attention to\nthem, but just enough to have noticed something off. Here, on this long\nshelf of pristine books, were three in a row with spines scuffed at the\nbottom. What distinguished these books? They were part of a seven-volume\ncollection of dry political treatises written long ago by the Counselor of\nGods.\nShe took one and flipped through it, finding nothing of interest. Perhaps\nInnate had been studying lately. But … why were only the third, fourth, and\nfifth volumes scuffed? She picked up another and opened it—and here she\nfound the reason. Cut into the center of the pages was a hole containing a\nkey. Innate hadn’t been reading Breeze’s old essays. He had simply\nforgotten which volume had the key in it.\nMarasi held up the key, then glanced at the room’s solitary desk. Dared\nshe?\nOf course I dare, she thought, crossing the room with a swish of skirts.\nHer constable credentials, plus Aradel’s concern about the governor, would\ngive her legal grounds for doing a quick search. She knew the law as well\nas anyone.\nShe also knew that the law was subject to interpretation by the city’s\njudges, most of whom had noble blood and would not take kindly to\nsomeone spying on the governor. That was why her fingers were trembling\nas she quickly tried the key in the desk drawer. It didn’t fit. She paused, then\ntried a spot on the floor like the one up above, where the governor had\ngotten out his seal.\nSure enough, there was a hidden safe under the rug.

She pulled the safe open and quickly\nscanned the contents.\nA pistol.\nCigars. She didn’t recognize the brand.\nA bundle of banknotes tied with string. Enough to buy a house. Marasi’s\neyes bulged a little, but she kept searching.\nA stack of letters. These she took over to the desk, expecting to find\ndetails of an illicit romantic relationship or the like. She skimmed them,\nthen read more deeply, then sank down into the desk’s chair, raising her\nfingers to her lips.\nThe letters did detail a relationship—or, rather, many of them. These\nwere private communications with house leaders throughout the city.\nAlthough couched in euphemism and circumlocution, to her they clearly\nspoke of corruption.\nMarasi grew cold as she flipped through them, letter by letter. The actual\nwriting was opaque. We agree that certain courtesies will be extended or\nThese are acceptable terms as per our previous arrangement. But they were\ndated, and her mind quickly related each of them to her notes back at the\nprecinct. This was proof. She flipped through more. Yes, they aligned with\nher own statistical analysis. These were Innate’s promises of political favors\nin exchange for bribes.\nWith the obfuscatory language, it might not be a smoking gun—but it\nwas at least a very warm one. Better, Innate had added notations to most of\nthe letters to remind himself of important points. Here was one probably\ntrading a promise by Innate to push for higher tariffs on refined steel from\noutside the city in exchange for a favorable deal on a land purchase by one\nof his family. Another more recent one was about a judge’s seat, when\nInnate had appointed a Hammondess scion to a recent opening.\nShe’d suspected corruption, but this was jarring—seeing it discussed\nlike this in black and white. She sifted through the stack. No letters to the\nLekals, his primary rivals. None to Waxillium either, Marasi saw with relief\n—nor any older ones to Edwarn Ladrian, Waxillium’s uncle.\nUnder the letters was a ledger, which she expected would show what\nInnate thought he was still owed, and would also record the state of his\nprivate accounts. Flipping through quickly didn’t tell her enough to be\ncertain, but it did seem reasonable.\nMarasi sat holding it all, feeling overwhelmed. Rusts. The people are\nright to be in revolt. Was this the crux of Bleeder’s plan? Shove Innate into\nthe limelight, then undermine him by exposing his corruption—indeed, the\ncorrupt nature of virtually every noble family in the city? In revealing these\nletters, Marasi could be playing into the creature’s hands. That made her\nsick. If he was this corrupt, didn’t he need to be exposed and removed?\nShe hurriedly tucked the letters into her purse. Captain Aradel needed to\nsee this. Marasi quickly shut and locked the safe, put back the key, and then\nstarted up the steps.

She didn’t want to be in the basement when the\nfootman came looking for her to announce her carriage.\nInnate will claim they were planted by Bleeder, Marasi thought as she\nreached ground level. He’ll have an easy out. Beyond that, if he noticed\nthey were gone, he’d have a pretty good idea of who took them. That same\nservant was still cleaning up, and he’d seen Marasi go down and return.\nBut Rust and Ruin, she wasn’t going to just ignore something like this.\n* * *\nFlying through the air at night let Wax see the distinct presence of\nhumankind, as marked by strict boundaries. Where they dwelled, there was\nillumination. Pinpricks in the darkness, men and women staking a claim on\nthe night. The lights spread like the roots of a tree.\nHis uncle had left him far from where he wanted to be. Fortunately, for\na Coinshot even the vastness of Elendel was manageable. He didn’t\nimmediately turn inward, however, to visit the kandra Homeland. His\nuncle’s words haunted him, and before those Bleeder’s gibes. They attacked\nfrom two different directions, like pins pushed into either temple.\nHe needed to think, to be alone. Perhaps then he could sort through what\nthis mess meant. He landed on a rooftop overlooking the vast glowing\ncarpet of lights before him. A cat watched him from a nearby flower box, its\neyes alight. Below was another row of pubs. Loud, raucous. Surely it was\npast two in the morning, yet they showed no signs of quieting down.\nRusts, how he hated that one could never feel truly alone in the city.\nEven in the privacy of his mansion, the quiet was marred by the incessant\npassage of carriages outside.\nHe leaped away into the night, frightening the cat. He soared high in a\nlong arc, trying to get far enough away that he couldn’t hear the men\nshouting drunkenly in the row of pubs. His search took him eastward,\ntoward the edge of the city. As he approached, something emerged from the\nmists like the bleached spine of some ancient monster. Eastbridge, a\nmassive construction that spanned the Irongate River here.\nOn one hand, he marveled that humankind could create something like\nthis—an enormous riveted marvel, big enough to let motors pass and also\nhold railroad tracks. On the other hand, the mists completely engulfed the\nbridge, giving it an even more skeletal cast. Humankind would create, and\ntake pride in those creations, but Harmony’s presence could make it all\nseem trivial.\nDid He know? Wax landed atop one of the bridge’s towers, boots\nclanging. Could He have saved Lessie?\nThe answer was simple. Of course Harmony had known. To believe in a\nGod was to accept that He or She wasn’t going to deliver you from every\nproblem. It wasn’t something Wax had ever dwelled on. Living in the\nRoughs, he’d accepted that sometimes you just had to weather things on\nyour own. Help didn’t always come. That was life. You dealt with it.\nBut now, something felt different. He’d spoken to Harmony. Hell, Wax\nwas out here right now because of a request from God Himself. That made"

        "text": "But now, something felt different. He’d spoken to Harmony. Hell, Wax\nwas out here right now because of a request from God Himself. That made\nit all the more personal. God hadn’t saved Lessie, hadn’t given Wax\nwarning. And now He expected Wax to just hop to it and do as He\ndemanded?\nAnd what would you do? Wax addressed himself, walking along the\nbridge’s lofty pinnacle. Let the city burn? Let Bleeder keep killing?\nOf course he couldn’t. Harmony knew that too. He had Wax by the\nthroat.\nAre you there? Wax asked, sending the thought out. Harmony?\nHe felt at his ear before remembering that he’d taken out his earring. By\nnecessity, yes, but in that moment he was glad not to have it. Not to let God\nget a purchase on his mind, for the thoughts he had weren’t particularly\npious.\nWax strode through the mists, while down below a lone motorcar\nputtered across the bridge. Bleeder was toying with him. He could feel her\nfingers sneaking in, piercing his skull, wrapping around his mind. He could\nsee exactly what she was doing, yet couldn’t banish the questions she\nraised.\nWax paused at one end of the tower’s top. From here he could see the\nedge of the city, where the lights gave way to the darkness of the\ncountryside. Behind him, the city was a brilliant blaze, thousands upon\nthousands of lights, but the electric lines hadn’t yet come out past the\nbridge. On the outskirts of Elendel, the lights stopped. The last few hung on\nthe bridge, like lighthouses looking out at the vast blackness of the sea.\nHe yearned for that darkness. To leap out into it, escape all this\nresponsibility—stop needing to worry about hundreds of thousands of\npeople he couldn’t know, and get back to helping the few he could.\nFreedom. Freedom, to Wax, wasn’t the absence of responsibility. He\ndidn’t doubt that if he left again, he’d find himself as a lawman once more.\nNo, freedom was not lack of responsibilities—it was being able to do what\nwas right, without having to worry if it was also wrong.\nHe didn’t contemplate leaving, not seriously. But he did sit for a time,\nlooking out at that darkness. Trying to look past the people, the shadowed\nsuburbs, and see simplicity again. Rusts. What he wouldn’t give to trade all\nthe politicians, games, and secrets for an honest murderer calling him out\non the street.\nCoward.\nHis own thought. Not from Harmony, or Bleeder. That made it all the\nmore like a punch to the gut, for he knew it to be the truth. Wax took a deep\nbreath and stood up again, shouldering his burdens. He turned away from\nthe darkness and leaped off the bridge, Pushing himself into the night again.\nHe’d come here for a moment’s solace, to think.\nTurned out, he didn’t like where those thoughts were taking him.\n19\nAs much as Wayne appreciated all the fancy treats the governor was\nproviding, he had to admit he wasn’t entirely sympathetic to the man’s\nplight. After all, the whole point of having someone in charge—like the\ngovernor—was about makin’ sure people knew which fellow to kill."

Innate got to be in charge\nand order everybody about, but when the assassins got bored, they didn’t go\nwhack the guy what sold fish on the street corner. They went for the guy in\ncharge. You had to take the good with the bad, you did. On one hand, you\ngot fancy sweets any time of day. On the other hand, you might find\nmurderers in your loo. That was the breaks.\nAnd this Innate guy, he seemed to really want to meet Ironeyes. Not\nrunning away to the country when you knew a psychopathic, shapeshifting\nsuper-Allomancer was after you? Yeah, he understood he was a target. As\nWayne sauntered after him—taking the tray from the serving girl as she\ntried to retreat with the uneaten cakes—the governor stopped in the\ndoorway to his study.\n“I need a few minutes to think, to prepare my remarks,” he said to\nWayne and the other guards. “Thank you.”\n“But sir!” MeLaan said. “You can’t go in alone. We need to protect\nyou!”\n“And what are any of you going to do,” Innate said, “about someone\nwho can move at the speed of a thunderclap? We will just have to take our\nchances that the constables can deal with this … creature.”\n“I don’t think—” MeLaan began, but cut off as he shut the door, leaving\nher, Wayne, and a couple of other guards in the hallway.\nWayne rolled his eyes, then leaned against the wall. “You two,” he said\nto the other guards, “go watch the window from outside that room,\nwhydontcha? We’ll set up here.”\nThe two fellows shuffled, looked like they’d object, but then slunk out\nof the hallway. I wonder, Wayne thought, settling down on the floor beside\nthe door, if they’re rethinkin’ their career choices. What with most everyone\nelse guarding the governor dead already …\n“You mortals,” MeLaan said, waving toward the door, “can be\nsurprisingly cavalier with your limited life spans.”\n“Yeah,” Wayne said. “He probably just wants to get me in trouble.”\n“What?” MeLaan sounded amused. “By getting himself killed?”\n“Sure,” Wayne said. “The idiot forbade me from goin’ to his fancy party\nearlier, then ditched me afterwise. He’s got it in for me. He’s gonna get\nhimself killed, and leave me to explain it to Wax. ‘Sorry, mate. I let your pet\npolitician get ripped in half.’ And Wax’ll scowl at me real good, even\nthough ’s not my fault.”\nMeLaan sat down across from him and grinned. “Is that what happened\nto his horse?”\n“Why you gotta bring that up again?” Wayne asked, wriggling down to\nget comfortable and tipping his hat over his eyes. “That really wasn’t my\nfault. I had myself a dehabilitating injury when that happened.”\n“De…”\n“Yeah,” Wayne said, “made me cuss and drink like a bugger.” He settled"

Servants moved through the building.\nMessengers went over their routes. Important types discussed their opinions\njust a room over.\nThey all talked. Everyone had to talk. People couldn’t just think\nsomething, they had to explain it. Wayne was the same. He was people,\nafter all.\nThis murderer, this kandra, she was people too. She had talked to Wax.\nShe had to talk.\nWax would probably catch her. He did things like that, impossible\nthings that nobody thought he could. But just in case he didn’t, Wayne\nlistened. You could tell a lot about people from the way they talked. You\nsaw their past, their upbringing, their aspirations—all in the words they\nused. And this kandra … sooner or later she’d slip up and use the wrong\nword. A word that would be obvious, like a fellow drinking milk in the\nmiddle of a rowdy tavern.\nHe didn’t hear anything right off, though oddly he did notice MeLaan\nwhispering to herself. As he listened, she modulated her voice, making it\ndeeper—though still feminine. She repeated a few words to herself.\n“She woulda been a twofie,” Wayne noted, eyes still closed.\n“Hm?” MeLaan said.\n“Your bones,” Wayne said. “Woman you’re wearin’ right now. Twofie.\nSecond Octant. Raised on the outskirts.”\n“And how do you know that?” MeLaan asked.\n“Heard her curse as I was helpin’ her,” Wayne said, feeling a stab of\nregret. The woman had just been doing her job, trying to keep someone\nfrom being killed.\nShe’s still doing her job though, he thought, cracking an eye and looking\nat MeLaan. Her bones are, at least. Given the choice, if he died while\ntrying to do something important, he’d rather that his bones get up and see\nit done right. Hell, with some kandra friends, he could be annoying Steris\nwell into the afterlife.\n“Like this?” MeLaan said. “Second Octant, touch of agave farmer?”\n“Nice,” Wayne said. “Draw out the end of your sentences, pitch them\nlower. Get some real twofie into that voice.”\n“Is this better?”\n“Yeah, actually,” Wayne said, sitting up. “That’s damn good.”\n“TenSoon would be proud,” MeLaan said. “I can still get a difficult\naccent right, when I need to.”\n“Difficult?” Wayne said. “The twofie accent?”\n“With agave farmer.”\n“Common mix,” Wayne said. “Once, I hadda do a guy who grew up on\nthe northwestern coast, raised by deaf parents, only talking once in a while\n—who had then moved in with the Terris fundamentalists up in the\nmountains there.”\nMeLaan frowned as a servant bustled past carrying linen. Some of the\nexecutive staff were going to be staying through the night, what was left of\nit, and guest rooms needed to be prepared. “I don’t know if I can do that,”"

Being\nraised by parents who can’t hear doesn’t make a chap stupid. He just looks\nat the world differently, see?”\n“Not bad,” MeLaan said. The next servant who passed gave them a\nglare as she had to pick her way over their outstretched legs in the hallway.\n“It’s better if I have a hat,” Wayne said.\n“A … hat.”\n“Sure,” Wayne said. “Hats is a disguise for your brain. Helps you think\nlike the person what wore it last. You wanna know a guy? Put on his hat.”\n“Has anyone ever told you that you’re surprisingly wise?” MeLaan\nasked.\n“All the bloody time.”\n“They’re idiots. You’re not wise, you’re playing them. You’re doing this\non purpose.” She grinned. “I love it.”\nWayne tipped his hat forward, smiling and leaning back again. “I’m not\nlying ’bout the hats though. They do help.”\n“Sure,” MeLaan said. “Like bones.”\nHe cracked an eye at her. “Does it ever … bother you? Knowin’ you\nmight live forever?”\n“Bother me? Why would it? Immortality is damn convenient.”\n“Don’t know about that,” Wayne said. “Seems to me that it would be\nnice to finally be done, you know? It’s like … like you’re running a race,\nand you don’t know quite where the end is, but you got an idea. An’ you\nonly need to make it that far. I can do that, I figure. But you, you don’t have\nno end.”\n“You actually sound like you want to die.”\n“Someday,” Wayne said. “Huh. Maybe I should get into politics.”\nMeLaan shook her head at him, seeming bemused. “It can be daunting,”\nshe admitted a short time later, “to consider eternity, as Harmony must see\nit. But anytime I get bored, I can just live a new life.”\n“Put on a new hat,” Wayne said. “Become someone else.”\n“Switch it up. Be bold where once I was timid. Be crass where I was\nrespectful. Makes life interesting, dynamic.” She paused. “And there’s\nsomething else. We can die, if we want.”\n“What, just like that?”\n“Kinda,” MeLaan said. “Don’t know if you’ve read the accounts.\nThey’re blurry about this topic anyway, but near the end of the World of\nAsh, Ruin tried to take over the kandra. Control them directly. Well,\nTenSoon and those in charge, they were really terrified by that. So they\nplanned, and we all talked. And about a century after the Catacendre, we\nfigured out a way to stop our own lives. Takes a little concentration, but sets\nthe body into a spiral where we just … end.”"

Draw them out, if\nyou wanna sound like a real twofie.”\nShe cocked her head at him. “You’re wasted as a human.”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “I’ve barely had a few mouthfuls today.” He\nreached in his pocket and checked his flask. “Well, maybe a wee more than\nthat.”\n“No, I meant—”\nHe grinned at her, and she cut off, then grinned back. He tipped his hat\nto her, then closed his eyes and continued listening. A short time later, she\nstood up and started pacing the hall, and he could hear her saying her “a”\nsounds to herself as she walked.\nHe listened for a good long while, catching nothing abnormal, though he\nwas pretty sure the sanitation-minister guy was lying about his education.\nThat fellow had never been to the university—or if he had, he hadn’t hung\naround long enough to pick up the proper words. Wayne was mulling this\nover when he heard something out front. A voice, faint but unmistakable.\nHe scrambled to his feet, causing MeLaan to jump.\n“Gottago,” he said. “Watchdaidiot.”\n“But—”\n“Berideback,” Wayne said, clutching his hat and running down the\nhallway, his long Roughs-style duster flaring to the sides. He raced around\nthe corner and dashed toward the front of the mansion.\n“He said to deliver it here,” the woman was saying to the butler. “So\nI’ve brought it. It was a simple task—he just needed something made.\nHardly worth waking me…”\nShe turned to him. A radiant, glorious woman, built like a good Roughs\nfence—just tall enough, lean, but strong too. She had dark hair, which he’d\ncompared to a pony’s on several occasions—and it was right unfair that she\nshould get mad, considering she kept it in a tail and everything. She wore\ntrousers, because skirts were stupid, and boots, ’cuz stuff needed to be\nkicked.\nThe whole world could be going wrong, but seeing her made him forget.\nHe grinned.\nIn return she gave him her special scowl, the one just for him. It was\nhow he knew she cared. That, and when she shot him she tended to aim for\nplaces that didn’t hurt too much.\n“She’s with me,” Wayne said, running up.\n“Like hell I am,” Ranette said, but she let him steer her away from the\nbutler.\n“And one wonders,” the butler said from behind, “how His Grace’s life\ncan be threatened, when we’re letting every dust rat in the city saunter up\nand—”\nHe cut off as Ranette spun, her pistol out. Wayne caught her arm in time\nto stop her from firing.\n“Dust rat?” she muttered.\n“When’s the last time you bathed?” Wayne said. Then winced. “Just …\nyou know, curious.”"

I have things to do. And I don’t like\nbeing ordered around.” She shook a little cloth pouch in her left hand.\nBehind, the butler had grown very pale.\nWayne got her into the sitting room. She didn’t stink, despite what she\nsaid—she smelled of grease and gunpowder. Good scents. Ranette scents.\n“What is it?” Wayne asked, snatching the pouch once they were out of\nsight.\n“Something Wax asked me to make,” Ranette said. “Who got killed\nover there?” She pointed toward the still-open secret door down to the\nsaferoom. Murder always caught her attention, if only because she’d want\nto see the bodies and judge how well the bullets tore up the flesh.\nWayne rolled a small metal object from the pouch onto his palm.\nA bullet.\nHis hand started to shake.\n“Oh, for Harmony’s sake,” Ranette said, plucking the bullet from his\nhand before he could drop it. “It’s not a gun, you idiot.”\n“It’s a part of one,” Wayne said, shoving his hand in his pocket and\nbreathing deeply. He could hold a bullet. He did that all the time, for Wax.\nThe shaking subsided. Something seemed odd about that bullet though.\n“So if I gave you a splinter of wood, and told you it had once been in a\nrifle stock, you’d go to pieces then too?”\n“Dunno,” Wayne said. “You think I understand how my brain works?”\n“I’d say there’s a logical fallacy in that statement,” Ranette said.\n“Maybe two.” She tucked the bullet back into the pouch. “Wax here?”\n“No. He’s off detectiving.”\n“Then you’ll have to take this,” she said, handing him the pouch. “His\nnote insisted it was important. Half powder as he asked, piercing bullet,\nforged not to shatter.”\nHe could hold a bullet. He took it, then tucked it away immediately in\nhis duster. See?\n“So, uh, want to go get a drink?” he said. “You know, when the city is\nsafe. Or maybe before it’s safe? I don’t mind none if the pub’s a little on fire\nwhile we drink.”\n“You know I’d sooner shoot myself, Wayne,” she said with a sigh. “And\nMisra would shoot me if—by chance—I did go, come to think of it.”\nWayne frowned. That was nowhere near the vitriol he normally got\nfrom her. “What’s wrong?” he asked.\nShe shook her head, glancing back toward the entryway. “It’s bad out\nthere, Wayne. People still on the streets, thronging together, shouting. I’ve\nseen crowds like this before, in the Roughs. Usually right before a man got\nstrung up, law or no law.

This was bad.\n“They’re starting to gather outside,” Ranette said, distracted. “Chanting\nslogans about the governor.”\n“I need to check that,” Wayne decided. If the governor wasn’t going to\nlet him in and watch him close up, maybe he could learn something about\nBleeder’s plans out in that crowd. “Get back to your house, lock the doors,\nand keep your guns handy.”\nIt was telling that she didn’t offer the slightest objection to his order as\nhe strode toward the door out into the mists.\n* * *\nCaptain Aradel regarded the governor’s writ as he would the last will and\ntestament of a beloved family member: with both reverence and obvious\ndiscomfort.\n“He names me lord high constable,” Aradel said. “But … rusts, I’m no\nlord.” He looked up at Reddi and his other lieutenants.\n“Perhaps,” Reddi said, “the appointment conveys a title, sir.”\n“The governor can’t just appoint someone to the peerage,” Marasi said.\n“A new title has to be ratified by a council with a quorum of the major\nhouse seats in the city.” She bit her lip as soon as she said it. She didn’t\nmean to be contrary.\nAradel didn’t appear to mind. He carefully folded the writ and slid it\ninto his jacket pocket. She’d found him gathering a sizable force outside of\nheadquarters, preparing to still malcontents and ring constabulary bells to\nlet the people living nearby know that at least someone was patrolling this\nnight. Phantom sounds floated through the mists. Distant shouts. Clangs.\nScreams. It felt like hell itself surrounded them, shrouded in a veil of\ndarkness and fog.\n“Sir,” Marasi said. “The governor said that he wanted you to do two\nthings. First, send a detachment to forcefully quell rioting in the city.\nSecond, bring up a smaller force to guard him as he prepares to address the\npeople near the mansion. You’re not to turn protesters away there, but\nelsewhere in the city … sir, he counseled you to be firm of hand. Very\nfirm.”\n“Rusting idiots deserve it,” said Lieutenant Mereline, a woman with\nshort blonde hair.\n“No need for bloodthirst, Lieutenant,” Aradel said. “I seem to remember\nyou cussing out the Hasting family with some regularity yourself.”\n“Doesn’t mean I’m setting fire to the city,” Mereline said. “The high\nhouses being bastards doesn’t excuse being bastards ourselves. Sir.”\n“Well, the mansion seems a good enough center from which to operate,”\nAradel said. “Chip, you and the messengers run to the other constables-\ngeneral and ask them to meet me at the governor’s mansion with their\nofficers.

The rest of the constables fell into a march. An uneven one—\nthey weren’t soldiers—but no less resolute.\n“Sir,” Marasi said, walking quickly up to Aradel, “there’s something\nelse I need to tell you, if you can spare a moment.”\n“How important is it?” Aradel asked, pausing at the side of the group.\n“Very.”\nReddi cleared his throat behind them. “Perhaps you should discuss it\nwhile traveling to the mansion, sir.

The things she wanted to discuss would be best said in\nthe privacy of a carriage anyway.\nExcept …\nIdiot, she thought as Aradel jogged over to a group of horses in\nconstable livery, reins held by a corporal. The carriage she’d been\ncontemplating pulled away, loaded with equipment most likely. Reddi\ngrinned at her smugly.\nMarasi sighed. She’d been looking forward to maintaining her decorum\ntonight. Ah well. She walked over and took a set of reins.\nAradel was already in his saddle. He glanced at her, then raised a hand\nto his head. “Oh, of course. I didn’t think—”\nMarasi swung up into the saddle, awkwardly bunching her skirt up\nbetween her legs and sitting on part of it, revealing a generous expanse of\nleg. “It occurs to me, sir,” Marasi noted, “that lady constable uniforms\ncould be distinctly more utilitarian.”\n“We’ll … make a note of it, Lieutenant Colms.” He glanced toward the\nretreating carriage. “If you wish—”\n“Sir,” Marasi said, “I believe the city is on fire. Perhaps we can discuss\nfeminine modesty on another occasion?”\n“Of course.” He nodded and they set off in a clatter of hooves, trailed by\ntwo corporals with rifles in the scabbards on their saddles. The four horses\nquickly outpaced the larger group of constables, and even the carriage, as\nthey rode through the mists.\nMarasi was glad of the darkness, as it hid her furious blush. In\ncompensation, she had gained the memory of Reddi’s stunned expression,\nutterly shocked by what she’d done.\nWell, why shouldn’t she show her legs?

What\nlord would turn away a Thug or a Bloodmaker from his guards just because\nshe had breasts? What constable office would pass up the chance to have\nevery Tineye or Coinshot they could get? What bank wouldn’t jump at the\nchance to employ a Terriswoman with copperminds?\nThe thing was, woman constables were also expected to be models of\nladylike behavior. A holdover from the old days, reinforced by the speeches\nof Lady Allrianne Ladrian soon after the Catacendre. There was just this\nblunt expectation that you would strive to remain feminine at the same time\nas you did your job. A heavy double standard to bear. At times Marasi didn’t\nmind. She liked dresses, and nice hair, and solving problems with a careful\nword instead of a fist to the face. To her it was perfectly reasonable to be\nfeminine and a constable. But did the men ever have to worry about being\nproperly masculine while doing their jobs?\nOne social problem at a time, Marasi, she admonished herself, riding\nalongside Aradel. Though she was going to buy some rusting trousers.\nRiding this way was cold.\n“You ride well,” Aradel called to her as they slowed slightly from their\ninitial burst away from the others. He led the way across a canal bridge,\ncutting across the middle of the Third Octant to get to the Second.\n“I’ve had plenty of practice,” Marasi said.\n“That’s uncommon in the city these days,” Aradel noted. “A hobby?”\n“You could say that,” Marasi said, blushing as she remembered her\ngirlish fascination with the Roughs, lawmen, and Allomancer Jak stories.\nWhen her friends—well, acquaintances—had been given new coats for\ntheir birthdays, she’d begged for a Roughs duster and hat.\nPure foolishness, of course. She’d completely grown out of that.\n“What is it you wanted to tell me?” Aradel called.\n“Could we slow further for a moment?”\nHe nodded and obliged, to the point where the horses were maintaining\na brisk walk. Marasi opened the purse she’d slung over her shoulder and\nthrust the letters at Aradel. She hadn’t consciously realized how eager she’d\nbeen to pass them on to someone else, so that the responsibility they\nrepresented wouldn’t rest solely on her.\nAradel took them. “What’s this?” he asked quietly.\n“You remember telling me to snoop around the governor’s place, if I got\nthe chance?”\n“I remember telling you—with great circumspection—to keep your eyes\nopen, Lieutenant.”\n“I did, sir. I kept my hands open too. In case something damning\nhappened to fall into them.”\n“Harmony. What did you find?”\n“Letters,” Marasi said, “from Innate to various ladies and lords in the\ncity, arranging for the purchase of political favors and the suppression of\nlegislation they didn’t want. Sir, they’re annotated in his own hand, and\nthey match my records of suspicious events during his tenure as governor.\nDuring the ride to bring you the writ I read through them, and I’m\nconvinced he’s just as corrupt as his brother was.”"

He rode\nin silence, gripping the letters, eyes forward.\n“Sir?” Marasi finally asked.\n“You put me in a difficult position, Lieutenant.”\n“Sir. I’d say that the governor has put you in that position, not me.”\n“How legally did you obtain these?”\n“That depends,” Marasi said, “on how the courts would interpret your\nauthority to investigate when there is reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing,\nand whether or not you were justified in authorizing me to act.”\n“In other words, you stole them.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nAradel tucked them away.\n“It doesn’t mean we shouldn’t protect him, sir,” Marasi offered. “Until\nproven guilty in court, he’s still the rightful leader of the city. This isn’t the\nRoughs, where we can just stride up and shoot someone, then publish our\nreasons later.”\n“The mere fact that you feel you need to point that out,” Aradel said,\n“means you’ve been spending too much time with your Coinshot friend,\nColms. I’m not considering avoiding my duty. I’m just thinking of all those\npeople, and their rioting. And they’re right. They are being robbed by the\nsystem. Ruin … we were supposed to be better than this. What if the Lord\nMistborn saw us now?”\n“I suspect,” Marasi said, “he’d tell us to do something about the\nsituation.”\nAradel nodded curtly. When he offered no further commentary, Marasi\nkicked her horse back into a trot, and the lord high constable followed suit.\n* * *\nTradition held that today’s Field of Rebirth looked exactly the same as on\nthat day long ago when humankind had crept from the wombs of stone that\nHarmony had created. Though the city had claimed all of the surrounding\narea, this central ring of pleasant grass and gentle hills had been left as a\nmonument to another time.\nMarewill flowers brushed Wax’s mistcoat as he strode across the springy\nground. The tradition that this place hadn’t changed was pure stupidity.\nSurely when Breeze and Hammond had climbed out into the sunlight, they\nhadn’t found grass that was perfectly manicured or flowers that grew in\ncareful lines. Did people who spoke of that tradition just ignore the benches\nand the pathways? The buildings? Surely Harmony hadn’t left lavatories on\nthe grassland for the convenience of visitors.\nAt the center the highest hill was topped by the half museum, half\nmausoleum sheltering the tombs of the Last Emperor and the Ascendant\nWarrior. Their giant statues rose above, dominating the area. As Wax\napproached, he was surprised to find lamps on the low structure spilling\nlight across the grass and flowers. A pair of constables guarded the door.\n“Now, just turn on back and don’t make trouble,” one of them called as\nWax approached.\nWax ignored the order, striding out of the mists and up to the men. “The\ncaretakers called for your help, I assume?”\nThe two constables studied him, then reluctantly saluted.

His reputation\npreceded him, though these men wore the patches of constables from the\nFirst Octant. It was a precinct he hadn’t often visited, but who else strode\nthrough the night in a mistcoat with a shotgun strapped to his leg?\n“They’re worried about looters,” one of the constables said, a squat\nfellow with a half beard around his mouth. “Um, sir.”\n“Wise,” Wax said, striding past them and pushing into the mausoleum.\n“Uh, sir?” one of the constables said. “They said not to let … Sir?”\nWax pushed the door shut as the two constables started arguing outside\nabout whether they should stop him or not. He scanned the open foyer, with\nits murals of the Originators. Hammond, the Lord Mistborn, Lady Truth,\nWax’s own ancestor Edgard Ladrian. Portly and self-satisfied, in his portrait\nhe held a cup of wine. He’d always looked like the sort of person Wax\nwould want to punch on sight. The type who was certainly guilty of\nsomething.\nWax ignored the displays of various relics from the World of Ash, and\ndidn’t enter the chamber that held the resting places of the Ascendant\nWarrior and her husband, though he did raise his gun and spin the cylinder\ntoward them in acknowledgment. A Roughs tradition to respect the fallen.\n“What’s this?” A bleary-eyed woman stepped out of a nearby room,\napparently a small apartment for the caretaker. “Nobody was to be let in!”\n“Routine inspection,” Wax said, striding past without looking.\n“Routine? In the middle of the night?”\n“You asked for constable involvement,” Wax said. “Codes require that\nwhen you ask for guards from the precinct, we have to do an inspection to\nmake sure you don’t have contraband.”\n“Contraband?” the woman asked. “This is the Originator Tomb!”\n“Just doing my job,” Wax said. “You can take it up with my superiors\noutside, if you wish.”\nShe stormed out toward the front doors in a huff as Wax reached a small\nroom unadorned with relics or plaques. The only thing in here was a hole in\nthe ground.\nIt was a gaping pit fenced by a railing to keep inquisitive children from\ntumbling in. There was a ladder, but Wax dropped a bullet casing and\njumped, falling freely a short distance before slowing himself and hitting\nthe dark, glassy stone floor at the bottom.\nA few lights dangled from the ceiling, like drips of molasses. He Pushed\non a nearby light switch, causing the lights to flicker on throughout this\nenormous cavern. He’d visited here as a youth; every tutor brought their\ncharges to visit, and he understood it was common in the public schools as\nwell. It felt different now, standing alone in the large, low-ceilinged\nchamber. No jabbering tourists to break the mood or chase away visions of\nthe past.

He could only vaguely remember explanations during his tour here of\nwhy others remained dry.\nHe walked into the cavern, trying to imagine what it had been like to\nhuddle in one of these caves, the world dying outside, wondering if you\nwere going to spend the rest of your short life trapped in darkness. He\ntrailed his fingers on the stone walls as he wound around corners. The place\nwas large and open, but also contained a series of smaller, bulbous\nchambers at the side. Most were part of the museum, and contained plaques\nwith quotes from the Originators, written in metal. Others contained\ndepictions of the rebuilding of the world, or other relics such as a replica of\nboth Harmony’s Bands and the Bands of Mourning.\nOne entire chamber was dedicated to the Words of Founding,\nHarmony’s books, lore, knowledge, and own holy account of what had\nhappened to the World of Ash. Another chamber contained volumes by\nother Originators, some of which were considered holy canon by one sect or\nanother—while some, like the Docksithium, were decidedly apocryphal.\nWax had tried to read the thing once. Copyright pages were more\ninteresting.\nHe lingered at a chamber dedicated to the Survivor containing a hundred\ndifferent depictions of him by various artists, some contemporary, others\nancient. There was fervent fascination with his posthumous “apparitions” to\npeople during the final days, though Harmony himself attributed those to\nthe Faceless Immortals.\nEchoing voices chased Wax onward. Wayne would probably give him\nhell for confusing the poor people, rather than just telling them what he was\ndoing. Of course, Wayne would probably have convinced them he was the\nLord Ruler, then made them fix him dinner. So he tried not to let Wayne’s\nmoral compass influence him too much.\nWax counted down the chambers dedicated to each of the metals until\nhe reached the sign of atium. This little chamber contained documentation\nand rumors about the mythological metal; Wax didn’t have the time to read\nthem. Instead, he followed the blue lines his steelsight showed him. They\npointed toward a side wall, where he was able to pry back a decorative\npiece of wood paneling and push on a lever, popping open a doorway and\nrevealing a cavern beyond.\nHe slipped in, unhooked an old oil lantern from the wall, and pulled the\ndoor shut before kneeling down in the pitch blackness, fishing in his gunbelt\nfor some matches. As he pulled them out, a growling voice sounded in the\ndimness.\n“I’ve been waiting for you.”\n20\nWax held very still in the darkness. He flared his steel, seeking guidance\nfrom that comfortable fire inside of him. The blue lines pointed exclusively\nbehind him; those pointed toward the hidden doorway and the nails in the\nwall. There was nothing else.\nExcept … Could he just barely make something out? Two faint lines,\ntiny as the threads of a spiderweb. He flared his metal, straining, Pushing.\nThe lines quivered in the darkness. Then they were gone.\nWax whipped out his Sterrion and pointed it down the corridor away"

Then they were gone.\nWax whipped out his Sterrion and pointed it down the corridor away\nfrom the lines, and fired three times in quick succession. The flash of\ngunpowder lit the room like lightning as he leveled his other gun toward the\nblue lines and the source of the sound.\nIn those flashes, he made out something in the darkness crouching\nnearby. It was inhuman, with bestial eyes and stark white teeth. Rust and\nRuin. Fingers sweaty on his gun, Wax backed away from the thing, ready to\nfire.\nHe didn’t pull the trigger. You didn’t shoot something for talking to you.\n“You’re certainly a jumpy one,” the voice growled.\n“Who are you?” What are you?\n“Light your lantern, human,” the voice said. “And lock that door. Let’s\nbe away from here before someone comes to investigate the gunfire.”\nWax paused to catch his breath and steady his nerves, but eventually\nslipped his guns back into their holsters. Whatever it was, it could have\nattacked him instead of speaking to him. It didn’t want him dead.\nHe lit the small lantern, but when he raised it, the creature had retreated\ninto the corridor until it was just a shadow. Still unnerved, Wax flipped the\nlatches he found on the wall, locking the hidden doorway closed from the\ninside.\n“Come,” the voice said.\n“You’re one of them,” Wax whispered, raising the lantern and following\nthe shadowy figure, which walked on all fours. “You’re a kandra.”\n“Yes.”\nWax jogged to catch up, his lanternlight finally giving him a good look\nat his companion. A wolfhound, easily the largest he had ever seen, of a\nmottled grey coloring. The pelt reminded him of the mists.\n“I’ve read about you,” Wax said.\n“Thrilling,” the kandra growled. “I’m so happy Sazed included me in\nhis little book so that drunk people can curse by my name.”\n“They … do that?”\n“Yes.” The wolfhound growled quietly in the back of his throat. “There\nare … stuffed toys too.”\n“Oh yeah,” Wax said. “Soonie cubs. I’ve seen those around.”\nThe growling grew louder, and Wax’s nervousness returned. Best not to\ntaunt the immortal hound. He didn’t know how many of the legends of this\ncreature were true, but if even a percentage were based in fact …\n“So,” Wax said. “Guardian. You were waiting for me?”\n“It was decided,” the kandra said, “that allowing a human to wander\nthese caverns alone was unwise. I came myself. The others are busy.”\n“Hunting Bleeder?”\n“Counteracting her,” the kandra said, leading him to an intersection,\nthen taking the right fork.\nThey walked in silence for a short time before Wax cleared his throat.\n“Um … do you mind explaining what you mean by that?”\nThe dog sighed, a discomforting sound. A talking dog was strange, but\nthe sigh was just so human.\n“I don’t talk much these days,” the kandra said. “I’ve … fallen out of\npractice, it seems.

She has\ndisdain for the rest of us, and therefore underestimates us in equal measure.\nWe can do what she does, imitating people, appearing on the streets. For\nevery ‘priest’ she has commit an atrocity, we will have dozens out tonight,\npreaching temperance and peace, pleading with the people not to listen to\nrumors.”\n“Wise,” Wax said. He hadn’t considered what the other kandra might be\ndoing, other than vaguely assuming they were tracking Bleeder. This made\ngood sense. Could he use it, somehow, in his investigation?\nAs they moved deeper into the caverns, Wax noted a crusty white\nsubstance growing on the rocks, the source of the powdery residue he’d\nfound on Bleeder’s clothing. Presumably, if he extinguished his lantern he’d\nbe able to see the glow. He might not even need the lantern, but thinking of\nall this stone surrounding him—separating him from the mists above—he\nfelt no urge to extinguish it.\nThe network of tunnels was far more extensive than he’d expected.\nHe’d thought of this place only as that one cavern underneath the tomb—\nbut that wasn’t it at all. Harmony had assembled many different refuges of\npeople as he remade the world, placing them all in the same area that was\nnow Elendel. How much of the city did these tunnels stretch beneath? He\npassed a number of them that had flooded; what was the difference between\nthose and the ones that remained dry?\nAs they wound through the tunnels, they passed an opening into a\ndifferent large cavern. He raised his lantern to give it a glance, then froze in\nplace. Instead of more rough, natural rock, his light illuminated dusty tiles\nand pillars, with parts of the floor torn up. Past them, there was what\nappeared to be a small hut of all things.\n“TenSoon?” he asked as the kandra continued forward.\n“Come along, human.”\n“Is that…”\n“Yes. Many people hid in the basements of Kredik Shaw, the Lord\nRuler’s palace. Sazed moved that here, as he did with all other caverns of\nrefuge.”\nWax couldn’t pull himself away, gaping at history—no, mythology—\ncome alive. The Lord Ruler’s palace. Places where the Survivor and his\nfollowers had walked.\nRusts … the Well of Ascension itself would be in there.\n“Human,” the kandra said, insistent. “There is something I wish for you\nto see. Come.”\nAnother time, Wax thought, turning from the entrance to lost Kredik\nShaw and following TenSoon. “MeLaan said that the kandra don’t come\ndown here often. Why not? Isn’t this your home?”\n“It is a sacred place,” the wolfhound said. “Yes, it is home, but also a\nprison—and so much more. Under the Lord Ruler, we needed this place for\nfreedom, to be ourselves. Outside, we were controlled, enslaved by men.”\nBitter, Wax thought. Even after hundreds of years, this creature was\npained by the life it had led. Did he blame humankind? Did Bleeder?"

        "text": "Bitter, Wax thought. Even after hundreds of years, this creature was\npained by the life it had led. Did he blame humankind? Did Bleeder?\n“We come here,” TenSoon said, “when the mood strikes us. Usually we\ncome alone, and infrequently. There are clubs up above where we can\nsocialize now, being ourselves. Homes. Lives. The younger generations\nalmost never visit this place. They prefer their lives as they are now, and\ndon’t wish to remember the past. I suppose I’m the same, though for\ndifferent reasons.”\nWax nodded, walking alongside the kandra as they penetrated ever\ndeeper into the twisting tunnels of the Homeland. They passed many empty\nchambers, but some that held oddities, like two with old baskets and some\ndiscarded bones on the floor.\nWax had been in his fair share of tunnels out in the Roughs, but most of\nthose had been some kind of man-made mine. These caverns were different.\nThose had smelled of dust and dirt, while this place somehow felt alive. Of\nwater and fungus. Of patience.\nThe tunnels were knobby, yet smooth, like wax pooled beneath a long-\nburning candle. Holy ground. Everything else in the world, so far as he\nknew, had been completely remade during the Catacendre. But these\ncaverns stretched back to eternity, as old as human memory. Older.\nEventually they reached a small chamber that didn’t seem quite as\norganic as the others. Had it been shaped, somehow, by kandra hands?\nTenSoon settled down on his haunches in the entrance to the room. Wax’s\nlight glittered off the smooth, bulbous rock of the floor, which fell away into\na series of pits. Perhaps three feet across, they looked like holes dug by\nprospectors foolishly hunting metals out in the Roughs.\nWax glanced at TenSoon.\n“I passed by here on my way to meet with you,” the kandra said in his\ngrowling, half-human voice. “I smelled something wrong.”\nSmelled something? Wax couldn’t catch any odd scents—but this whole\nplace smelled strange to him. He stepped into the room, then noted\nsomething. One of the small pits was full. Were those sheets of paper?\nYes, they were. As Wax knelt at the rim of the pit, he was surprised to\nfind hundreds of sheets of paper inside, jagged on one edge, as if they’d\nbeen ripped from a book. They contained cramped writing, with numbered\nverses. The Words of Founding.\nBesides the normal writing, someone had scrawled all over these in\nbrownish-red ink.\nBlood, Wax thought. It’s blood.\nHe set down his lantern, then reached down and picked up a page. Book\neighty, verses twenty-seven through fifty. Verses about Harmony’s quest for\nTruth.\nSomeone, likely Bleeder, had written all over them the words Lies, lies,\nlies.\nWax dug up other sheets. Most had something written on them, a word\nor phrase, though many were just smeared with blood. Something bothered\nWax about it all, something that made his eye twitch. He couldn’t say what\nit was.\nI was there, one sheet read. Nobody, said another. It was, said another.\nHe started laying them out. TenSoon—whom he’d almost forgotten—"

TenSoon—whom he’d almost forgotten—\nsniffed in the doorway.\nWax glanced back. “Did you see these?”\n“Yes,” TenSoon said.\n“What do you make of them?”\n“I … did not stay long,” the kandra said, then looked to the side. “I do\nnot spend time in this room, human. I am not fond of it.”\nThis room … Wax felt cold. Was this the prison that TenSoon had been\ntrapped in, locked away without bones, awaiting execution?\nRusts. He was kneeling in a place that had decided the fate of the world.\nWax stretched down, grabbing more of the sheets. It seemed like\nBleeder had ripped apart an entire set of the Words of Founding—the\nunabridged version. Old edition too, judging by the fact that it had been\nhandwritten instead of printed.\n“You really knew her, didn’t you?” Wax asked. “The Ascendant\nWarrior?”\n“I knew her,” TenSoon said softly. “Near the end, I spent over an hour\nwithout my spikes, and so my memories degraded. However, most of what I\nlost was from the time right before my fall. Most of my memories of her are\ncrisp.”\nWax hesitated with stacks of pages in his hands. “What was she like? As\na person, I mean.”\n“She was strong and vulnerable all at once,” TenSoon whispered. “She\nwas my last master, and my greatest. She had a way of pouring everything\nof herself into what she did. When she fought, she was the blade. When she\nloved, she was the kiss. In that regard, she was far more … human than any\nI have known.”\nWax found himself nodding as he settled the pages about him, in stacks\nbased on whether they had words or not. The ones with fingerprints he set\nin their own stack. Perhaps they would be useful. Probably not. Bleeder was\na shapeshifter, after all.\nTenSoon eventually padded up to him. “They look,” TenSoon said,\ninspecting the sheets, “like they might say something if you string them\ntogether.”\n“Yeah,” Wax said, dissatisfied.\n“What is wrong?”\n“It’s too much,” Wax said, waving his hand at it. “Too convoluted, too\nsensational. Why would she write on a bunch of pages, then rip them out\nand leave them here?”\n“Because she’s mad.”\n“No,” Wax said. “She’s not that kind of mad. The way she’s been\nworking is too deliberate, too focused. Her motives might be insane, but her\nmethods have been careful.” How could he explain it? This case had his\ninstincts fighting with one another.\nHe tried again. “When someone leaves something like this behind, it\nmeans one of two things. They’re sloppy, or they’re trying too hard. She’s\nnot sloppy, but I don’t think she’s trying to be cute either, dangling clues\nand playing games. When I talked to her…”\n“You spoke with Paalm?” TenSoon demanded, his ears perking up.\n“When?”\n“Earlier tonight,” Wax said. “There was something regretful about her."

A\nthousand discarded pages, left to be put back together and form a clue?” He\nshook his head. “I don’t buy it.

Is that odd? You’re doing it right now, and MeLaan seems to be\nacting no specific role either.”\n“We are not Paalm,” TenSoon said. “As long as I’ve known her, she’s\nbeen subject to the performance. I was like that too, years ago. I didn’t\nknow who I was if I was not imitating someone.”\nWax looked across the sheets. Freedom, one of them said in a scrawl\nacross the page. Will give you freedom whether you, said another, only half\nof a thought.\n“What was she like?” Wax asked. “Who is she, Guardian?”\n“Hard to say,” TenSoon replied. “Paalm was the Lord Ruler’s pet\nkandra, a slave to his will and the contract we made with him. She ignored\nevents surrounding the end of the World of Ash; she vanished, didn’t return\nto the Homeland. I assumed her dead, until she appeared among the\nsurvivors. Even then she separated herself from us, though she served\nHarmony as we all did. Until … nothing. Absence.”\n“Freedom,” Wax said, tapping the page. “She talked about that with me.\nWhat does it mean?”\n“I don’t know,” TenSoon said, voice even more a growl than before.\n“She has betrayed everything we are. But then, so did I. So perhaps we are\na pair, she and I. Two of the oldest monsters remaining on this planet, now\nthat many of the Seconds have taken the escape of ending their own lives.”\n“Freedom…” Wax whispered. “Someone else moves us.… She left a\nnote for me in the governor’s mansion. She removed a politician’s tongue,\nto stop his lies. Killed a priest through the eyes, to stop him from looking.\nSeeing. For who? For what?”\nShe had been the Lord Ruler’s kandra, moved about and danced at his\nwhims. And then … Harmony’s servant? She lived with his voice inside her\nhead, knowing all along that he could take control of her. How would that\nfeel?\nWould it make you remove one of your spikes? Would you be trying to\nbring that freedom to everyone? Misguided, in your insanity, certain that the\nworld needed saving?\nWax stood up slowly. “It’s about Harmony.”\n“Lawman?”\n“She’s trying to bring down God Himself.”\n“That’s insane.”\n“Yes,” Wax said, turning to the kandra. “It is.” He started to pace in the\nsmall room. “Speak to Harmony and find out something for me. Did\nBleeder first leave because Harmony tried to take control of her at some\npoint? Did that set her off?”"

Did that set her off?”\nA moment of silence. “Yes,” TenSoon replied. “Harmony says He didn’t\ntry to control her directly, but He did push her very hard to do something\nshe didn’t want to do.”\n“She’s been persistent about this idea that all people are controlled.”\nHarmony … was she Bloody Tan? Was she wearing his body, even back\nthen? Was she there when I shot Lessie? “She sees everyone as Harmony’s\npuppets—in her eyes, the politicians are His mouth. She’s bringing down\nthe government for that reason. Religion? Harmony’s eyes, to watch over\nthe people. She works to undermine that by creating strife between the\nreligious sects.”\n“Yes…” TenSoon said. “In a way, it could be seen as a continuation of\nthe First Contract. Serve the Lord Ruler. Bring down the force that he\nworked to defeat. Harmony is half of that.”\n“But what am I in this?” Wax continued, only half listening to TenSoon.\n“Why me? Why focus on—”\nNo, wrong question.\nWhat was she going to do next? Eyes, tongue … ears, maybe? Pretend\nshe’s a step ahead of you, Wax told himself. Prepare for the worst.\nHe looked again at the sheets on the floor. She wanted Wax out of the\nway. An elaborate puzzle? It was a time waster, a distraction. She’d ripped\nout these sheets not to tease him, but to remove him from the investigation\nlong enough to accomplish the next phase of her plan. She’d led him here\nwith that dust on her robe. She’d planted it there for that purpose.\n“She knows,” Wax said softly. “She knows what you’re going to do,\nTenSoon. What you’ve done.” He felt cold, and met the kandra’s inhuman\neyes. “She’s planned that you would send your kandra to try to win back the\nhearts and minds of the people. That exposes you. Her next step is to bring\nthem down.”\n* * *\nWayne wandered between two bonfires. Inside one, table and chair legs\nmade sharp lines, like the shadowy limbs of corpses being burned. The\nmists didn’t get too close to the fires, though the smoke made a good\nimitator in the night. Like a beggar dressed up so nice, you only knew him\nfor what he was when you got close enough to catch a proper whiff.\nWayne leaned in to one of the bonfires to light his cigar, though that\nrequired him to heal the skin of his arm as it burned. He smelled both of his\nown singed hair and of the scent of the fire. Polished furniture didn’t burn\nclean. He liked feeling the heat though. Made him feel alive.\nHe had stopped filling his metalminds, hoping he had enough health for\nwhat was coming. He couldn’t afford to be weak or sickly right now. Not\nwith what was happening.\nHe leaned back away from the flames and settled the cigar between his\nteeth. It was a fancy type, from the governor’s own hidden stash. Wayne\ntook a long puff before remembering that he hated the rusting things. Ah\nwell. He hadn’t traded anything good for it. Just one of Wax’s forks."

        "text": "took a long puff before remembering that he hated the rusting things. Ah\nwell. He hadn’t traded anything good for it. Just one of Wax’s forks.\nThe crowd gathering here in the square was the biggest he’d seen this\nnight. They clumped in the bonfire light like a flock of ravens drawn to a\nkill. Wayne moved up to the back of the crowd and handed his cigar to\nsomeone there. He left her standing, baffled, as he dove into the crowd.\nWith a crowd this big, you couldn’t move through them, but with them.\nYou hadda pull the crowd on like a good coat, snug and tight, then let the\ncloth give you some direction. Wayne shuffled when the people shuffled,\nand shouted at the proper points, giving just the right drunken slur to his\nspeech. He gave back a friendly elbow when one nudged him, and before\ntoo long he neared the front. Here, above everyone else, a shirtless fellow in\ntrousers and suspenders stood atop a fountain statue, holding on to the\nSurvivor’s spear for balance, his other fist raised toward the crowd.\n“They rob us blind!” the man shouted.\nAye, that’s true, Wayne thought, shouting along with the crowd’s roar of\nagreement.\n“They expect us to work long hours every day, but then when it ain’t\nconvenient for them, they just cut us loose and don’t care none if we\nstarve.”\nYeah, they do, Wayne thought, joining in the cursing and shouting.\n“They do each other favors,” the man bellowed. “They suck us dry, then\ngather to throw lavish parties!”\nI’ve been to those parties, Wayne thought. Good sandwiches.\n“Would the Survivor have stood for this?”\nProbably not, Wayne admitted. As the crowd surged around him, Wayne\nfolded his arms and thought. Sure, bringing down a homicidal shapeshifter\nwas important and all, but rusts, this seemed a bad time to be hanging\naround with conners and noblemen. Listening to this speech, he was half\ninclined to string himself up, which was really disturbing, since he was\ngenerally suicidal only in the mornings.\nHe was about to turn away and flow back toward the mansion to talk\nwith MeLaan about this when something changed. A new figure climbed up\nonto the statue: an older, balding man who was a little thick around the\nwaist, but in a friendly-type way. He wore ornate robes that frayed like a\nmistcoat at the bottom. A Survivorist priest?\nThe older man held up a pleading hand, and the fellow who had been\nshouting bowed his head in acknowledgment and stepped back. Beneath the\ngiant image of the Survivor, his priest would be heard. Wayne felt a\ndisturbance stir within him, like his stomach discovering he’d just fed it a\nbunch of rotten apples. Religion worried him. It could ask men to do things\nthey’d otherwise never do.\n“I come to you,” the priest said into the night, “understanding and\nsympathetic. But I implore you, do not invoke the Survivor’s name for\nlooting and destruction. There is a way to fight back, and I will join you in\nit, but these are not the days of the Lord Ruler’s tyranny. You have the\nability to make your voice heard. You can send advocates to the government\nfor you.”"

        "text": "it, but these are not the days of the Lord Ruler’s tyranny. You have the\nability to make your voice heard. You can send advocates to the government\nfor you.”\nThe crowd hushed. A few men shouted out expletives, explaining\nexactly what they wanted to do to the governor, but most grew quiet.\n“The Survivor said that we should smile,” the priest pled. “He taught\nthat we should not let our sorrows drag us down no matter how bad life\nbecame.”\nThe mood of the crowd was shifting. They shuffled instead of shouted.\nWayne relaxed. Well, maybe religion was good for something other than\nfancy clothes and weird hats. If that priest defused this group, Wayne would\nbuy him a drink, he would. And buying drinks for priests was great, because\nthey usually wouldn’t drink theirs, so you got two for yourself to …\nWait. Why was that fellow in the suspenders—the one who had talked\nbefore—sneaking up behind the priest? Raising his hand, as if to—\n“No!” Wayne shouted, shoving through the crowd toward the fountain.\nHe froze time, which caused quite a mess of confusion in the people around\nhim, but it didn’t do much. All that let him do was stand there feeling\nhelpless, knowing the priest was too far away to save. The fellow in the\nsuspenders stood just behind the gentle old man, hand raised, knife\nglittering in the firelight.\nExcept that wasn’t no knife. It was a needle.\nWayne dropped his speed bubble. The needle plunged down, striking the\npriest in the back. The round-faced man jerked upright, and then his flesh\nstarted to melt. It turned translucent, his eyes drooping out of their sockets,\ncrystal bones beneath glittering in the light of the bonfires.\n“Look!” the bare-chested man said. “See what they send to try to placate\nyou? The Faceless Immortals serve the nobility! This was no priest, but one\nof their minions. They want you to believe you’re free, that their democracy\nworks for you, but all that surrounds you is lies!”\nWayne gaped as the priest—no, the kandra—struggled to stand upright\nand speak, but that made it worse. The protesters shouted, their rowdiness\nback with renewed strength, save for near Wayne, where the people were\nstill confused as to why time had stopped for them.\nA woman in a dirty skirt eyed him. “Hey, aren’t you that guy from the\nRoughs?”\nWayne grimaced, backing away. On the fountain, the leader spotted him\nand interrupted his diatribe. He pointed right at Wayne. “One of them is\nhere!” he shouted. “They send constables into our midst! They’re all\naround, controlling you!”\nBasically the entire crowd turned to look at Wayne.\nWell, hell.\nfor any person in the room. Had I not bested the tribes at the Pits of Eltania? Was I not the first to\nbring back tales of the slopes of the Ashmounts, now gone green with vegetation? And wasn’t it I that\nhad domesticated the fabled long-necked horses of the Plains of Kaermeron?\n“I shall not lower this gun,” said the man, “until you pay for your crimes.”"

I noticed the almost\nimperceptible flicks of his eyes to the right and left. This wasn’t one of the Cobblesguilder henchmen\nas I’d at first thought. He was a man looking for revenge, and he wasn’t entirely sure if I was the one\nfrom whom he should exact it.\n“Let us talk this through peaceably,” I suggested. I gently removed Lady Lavont’s trembling\nfingers from my arm. “All will be solved, my lady,” I said, detecting a faint gasp in her breathing as\nmy fingers brushed hers for so short a moment.\nMustaches straightened. “You killed my brother three years back in the Roughs near Covingtar,”\nhe said.\nI needed time to think on his accusation, so I stepped forward, raised my hands in the air, and said,\n“As you can see, I am unarmed.” I turned in a circle, displaying to the crowd that I in fact held no\nsidearm. And yes, bravely, I turned my back on Mustaches, trusting in his uncertainty of my identity.\nAs I turned, I thought through my predicament. It was true that some three years back I had found\nmyself in the vicinity of Covingtar. But had I killed someone’s brother there? No doubt I had left\nmany a man brotherless, but never intentionally. The very thought of killing a man for the express\npurpose of leaving another man brotherless is highly repugnant to me.\n“I am not the man you seek,” I said, raising my glass for another sip because, by the Faceless, if I\nwas going to die I would do it drinking a fine Chamblis Montreau 328.\nThe gun barrel shook more. If my gambit failed, I would sport yet another bullet scar on my\nstrapping abdomen. Skin and muscle would heal, but the finely-woven shirt had been a gift from the\ndaughter of the owner of Gilles & Gilles—on the corner of Canton Avenue and Troncheau Way—\ntailors of exquisite and tasteful dress shirts for fashionable and high society types. I did not wish it to\nbe spoiled with my worthy blood.\n“Then who are you?” asked Mustaches, his gun’s barrel dropping more. The moment of danger\nwas not yet over, but my own breathing evened out. My enhanced senses found Mustache’s gazelle-\nquick heartbeat slowing to a more reasonable pace.\n“Gentleman Jak,” I said with humility. “Surely you have heard of me.”\n“So you ain’t that Waxillium Ladrian fellow?”\n“By the Survivor, no!” My anger rose without warning. Many a man had met the righteous end of\nmy knuckles for such a comment, but here in the barely civilized reaches of the Outer Cities, I knew I\nmusn’t punish this ill-informed yokel for his folly.\n“My good man, no,” I said more calmly and letting out a generous laugh. He shakily reholstered\nhis pistol. A crooked smile began beneath those knifelike mustaches of his. I approached him like I\nwould a prairie lion, but heartbeats later I was slapping him on the back like an old friend (and"

For I too would pull a gun on Waxillium Ladrian were\nI to meet him in person!”\nDanger averted, Lady Lavont came again to my side, a tinkle of laughter on her lips. Then I\nnoticed over the crowd two pairs of waving arms that I immediately recognized as Handerwym’s. In\ntrying to get my attention over the pressing crowd in the room, he shook his arms in so aggravated a\nfashion that one of his metalminds flew from his wrist and landed like an Outer Cities cataract diver\ninto the sparkle punch, spraying red droplets all in a mottle upon Lady Lavont’s pastel satin evening\ngown.\nMy dependable steward’s convulsing could only be interpreted one way. During my diversion with\nMustaches, the Lord Mistborn’s only remaining buttons had been stolen, swapped for the\nindistinguishable duplicates, and neither I nor Handerwym had been in a position to intercept the\nperpetrators.\nI needed my enhanced senses to seek out the thieves, but I had just used my last modicum of tin to\nhelp defuse Mustaches’ desire to bring me face to face with Old Ironeyes.\nI pushed through the crowd toward the only source of reliable tin in the room.

We will stop our efforts immediately, but He says it might be too\nlate.”\nWax nodded, holding his lantern and puffing from exertion.\n“We’re Harmony’s ears,” TenSoon growled. “That fits with her theme,\ndoesn’t it? We listen, move among you, report back to God. She’s going to\ntry to deafen Him.”\nWax nodded again.\n“That’s pointless!” TenSoon said. “She can’t stop Harmony. Even with\nall of this, she’s just a child throwing rocks at a mountain to try to move it.”\n“Yeah,” Wax said, scrambling over some rubble. Pieces of the kandra\nHomeland had obviously suffered from being shoved about in the earth\nduring the Catacendre. Walls had collapsed, then had lain here, broken, for\nhundreds of years. “But she’s not really trying to kill God. She just wants to\nfree people from Him, in her twisted way.”\n“Free them?” TenSoon said. He was silent for a time. “Emotion. That’s"

Vin liberated koloss by making them feel powerful emotions. It\ngave an opening into their souls, let her break through another’s control and\nseize the creatures.”\n“That’s what the old stories say,” Wax replied. “Good to have\nconfirmation.”\n“Humans aren’t Hemalurgic creations like koloss. Powerful emotion\nwon’t ‘free’ them from Harmony.”\n“Sure it will,” Wax said. “At least in Bleeder’s eyes. If you’re in a rage,\nyou’re not following Harmony’s careful plans. You’re out of control. She’s\ngoing to drive this city to madness in an insane attempt to liberate it.”\n“Ruin!” TenSoon growled. “I may have to leave you behind, lawman. I\nmust reach my people quickly and speak with them about what is\nhappening.”\n“Fine,” Wax said. “But I might keep up better than you assume, so long\nas I—”\nA shrill howl echoed through the corridor, so chilling that Wax pulled to\na stop. He drew Vindication, lantern held high in his off hand. The howl\nwas joined by others, a terrible cacophony, each sound jarring against the\nothers.\nTenSoon leaned low, growling as the howls faded.\n“What the hell was that?” Wax said.\n“I have never heard its like before, human.”\n“Aren’t you over a thousand years old?”\n“Something like that,” TenSoon said.\n“Holy hell,” Wax repeated. “Another way out?”\nThe kandra took off, leading him back the way they had come. The\nhowls started up again, louder. The tight tunnels and uneven stones\nsuddenly seemed far more confining.\nWax ran and, despite his earlier bravado, found he had real trouble\nkeeping up with TenSoon. The stone around them didn’t contain any metals,\nat least not in a pure enough form for him to Push on. Besides, the tunnels\ntwisted and turned too much for long Pushes.\nSo he ran, holding on to his lantern with sweating fingers, listening as\nthe things behind seemed to grow more excited. Distracted as he was, he\nalmost crashed into TenSoon when he caught up to him standing still in the\ntunnel.\n“What?” Wax asked, panting from his run.\n“It smells wrong ahead,” TenSoon said. “They’re waiting for us.”\n“Great,” Wax said. “What are they?”\n“They smell like men,” TenSoon said.\nMore howls came from behind.\n“Those,” Wax said, “are men?”\n“Come,” TenSoon said, turning and scrambling away, his claws\nscratching on stone.\nWax followed. “Another way out?” he asked again.\nTenSoon didn’t answer, instead leading them in a sprint through small\ncaverns, around corners, through tunnels. They stopped at an intersection,\nTenSoon considering their options while Wax fingered his gun nervously.\nHe swore he could see something moving down the tunnel they’d left\nbehind, the one where TenSoon claimed to have spotted an ambush.\n“TenSoon…” he said, nervous.\n“This way,” the kandra said, dashing off."

Perfect. He let himself lag\nbehind, holding up the lantern, trying to get a glimpse of whatever was\nfollowing.\nHis light reflected from eyes in the shadows. Figures that were bent low,\nscrambling on all fours, moving in a distinctly inhuman way. Sweating,\nWax dropped a shell casing and shoved it with his foot into a cleft in the\nrock. He Pushed, throwing himself down the corridor to catch up with\nTenSoon, landing just before they took a corner at speed.\n“They’re not human,” Wax said. “Not completely.”\n“Hemalurgy,” TenSoon said. “This is terrible. Paalm … She has gone\nfurther than I had assumed. She doesn’t just kill. She Ruins.”\n“They’re almost upon us,” Wax said, clutching gun and lantern. “How\ndo we get out?”\n“We don’t,” TenSoon said, ducking to the side and into a small chamber.\n“We fight.”\nWax followed, but stopped in the doorway, gun at the ready. They’d\npassed this room before, or one like it. It was filled with small baskets—\nglancing at them now, he could see they were full of bones.\nThe things chasing them had started yipping, but he could hear them\nscrambling on the stone—could hear them breathing in excited gasps—as\nthey drew close.\nInside the room, TenSoon transformed.\nIt happened in a burst, the kandra’s skin sloughing off his canine bones\nand splashing to the ground like a bucket of slop tossed out the back of a\nkitchen. The muscles and melting skin slapped against one of the baskets,\ntipping it, dumping bones.\nMeLaan had said he was fast, but that word didn’t begin to describe the\nsudden motion as TenSoon absorbed the bones. Arms sprouted from the\nside of his mass, then lifted it into the air even as legs formed beneath, thick\nlike those of a wrestler. A skull emerged like a bubble rising through\nmolasses, filling in with muscles stretched against bone, a jaw shifting into\nplace.\nIn seconds, a short but robust figure stood in the chamber. The face of\nstretched skin and muscle reminded Wax of a koloss, but those forearms\nwere like hammers, and the chest superhumanly powerful. It was nude,\nthough the crotch lacked genitals of either variety.\nWax looked back down the corridor outside and raised his pistol,\nsweating. The things prowled closer. Heads emerged from the darkness,\nfaces that twisted human features into something more canine. He counted\nfive total. These creatures were no longer bipedal, but traces of humanity\nlaced them—fingers that were too long, hands with opposable thumbs. The\njoints bent the wrong way at the elbows and knees, and the eyes … the eyes\nwere dead. Pure black.\n“What has she done to you?” Wax whispered at them.\nThe creatures didn’t respond. Either they could not think, could not\nspeak, or didn’t care to do either. Wax fired upward, half hoping that the\nsound would scare the things away, send them scuttling back into the night."

Wax fired upward, half hoping that the\nsound would scare the things away, send them scuttling back into the night.\nThe greater part of him hoped they would remain, so he could finish off\nevery last one of the poor bastards.\nThe single shot rang loud in the tunnel, but the beasts didn’t flee. Instead\nthey surged forward, their reluctance giving way to frenzy. Wax leveled\nVindication and unloaded at the first creatures, aiming for skulls. Flashes of\ngunfire lit the tunnel. Though his bullets tore off skin and left streaks of\nbleeding muscle, not one of the creatures dropped.\nWax ducked back into the room, holstering Vindication and setting his\nlantern on an outcropping. “Their skulls have been thickened,” he shouted\nto TenSoon while reaching for his Sterrion.\nThe kandra stepped past him, both lithe and powerful. Wax could almost\nhear the muscles constricting, pulling taught beneath that skin. As the first\ncreature entered, TenSoon smashed it on the side of the head, pinning it to\nthe wall with one hand. Then he stepped back and raised his foot to crush\nthe skull against the rocks.\nThe others leaped over TenSoon, dragging him down, biting his flesh.\nHe grabbed at one, ripping it free by the hind legs and hurling it away. Wax\nfired, aiming for the eyes.\n“They have been created to fight you,” TenSoon growled from the\nground, where he wrestled with one of the creatures while others tore at\nhim. “Flee. Your modern weapons are useless here, lawman!”\nLike hell they are, Wax thought, dropping his Sterrion and reaching to\nthe large holster on his thigh, bringing out his short-barreled shotgun. He\npulled out a handful of shells and tossed them to the floor with a sound like\nrain. Then he waded in, slapping the first monster that came at him across\nthe face with the shotgun. It flinched, then howled—baring rows of uneven\nteeth.\nWax shoved the shotgun into its mouth and fired.\nBits of it colored the wall, and as it fell—thrashing—it knocked over\nbaskets, spilling bones to the rock floor. The one creature’s death caught the\nattention of others, who turned from the bleeding TenSoon and charged\nWax.\nWax naturally preferred the pistol. A handgun was an extension of one’s\nfocus, a weapon of precision—like a thrown coin in anteverdant days. The\nsoul of the Coinshot, his will made manifest.\nThe shotgun was something different; it wasn’t an extension of focus or\nwill, but it did do a good job of representing his rage.\nWax shouted, slamming his shotgun across the face of one beast and\nPushing on the barrel, giving the swing incredible momentum. The blow\nflung the creature to the side as Wax spun and pumped his gun, then blasted\nat the leg of the next one, ripping its arm free at the shoulder and sending it\nface-first into the stone.\nHe leaped over the next one that came for him, Pushing on a fallen\nbullet for lift.

It flipped\nbackward, exposing the belly.\nWax fired three times, emptying the shotgun. The underbelly was soft,\nas he’d hoped. The thing went down.\nHe stood, breathing deeply, the rhythm of the fight having consumed\nhim. Nearby, TenSoon rolled over, the wounds to his arms and sides\nresealing. He had killed another of the things by ripping it in half. His eyes\nwere wide as he regarded Wax. His bloodied face looked as inhuman as\nthose of the creatures they’d just fought.\nTenSoon climbed to his feet, surveying the wreckage. The lantern still\nburned calmly, illuminating bones scattered across the floor and masses that\nhad once—horribly—been human, but now just twitched. Wax felt sick.\nHe’d called them “things” in his head, but these had been people. TenSoon\nwas right. What Bleeder had done here was worse, somehow, than even her\nmurders.\n“I will need to ask Harmony,” TenSoon said, “if I have failed Him in\nkilling this day.” His voice was the same gravelly growl as before, when\nhe’d inhabited the wolfhound’s body.\n“Why would he care?” Wax said, still sick. “He uses me to kill all the\ntime.”\n“You are His Ruin,” TenSoon said. “I am His Preservation.”\nWax stood in silence amid the dead and dying and lowered his shotgun,\ntrying to suppress the immediate feeling of indignation he felt. Was that all\nhe was to Harmony? A killer? A destroyer?\n“Still,” TenSoon said, picking his way through the room and speaking as\nif he didn’t realize the insult he’d just offered, “I do not think Harmony will\nmind what I have done. These poor souls…” He knelt and prodded at one of\nthe bodies Wax had killed.\nTenSoon came up with a thin piece of metal, silvery and perhaps as long\nas a finger. Did it have a red cast to it, or was that just the blood? He used\nsteelsight and found that while he could see the spike, the line was duller\nthan it should have been. Hemalurgy.\n“One spike,” TenSoon said, turning it over. “Any more, and Harmony\nmight have been able to control these beasts. How could such a change be\neffected by a single spike? This is a level of Hemalurgy beyond my\nunderstanding, lawman.”\nWax shook his head, checking on the creatures.

I sent you.\nWax wasn’t certain if that was enough this time.\n“Tell me you’ll see these people buried,” Wax said.\n“I will,” TenSoon said as a howl sounded in the distance. “More come.\nDo we fight here, or run?”\n“Can you get us out?” Wax asked, reloading the shotgun.\n“Perhaps. Not by a conventional method, but there could be a way.”\n“Then let’s go,” Wax said. “This is another distraction, TenSoon. Those\ncreatures only came for us when we left the other chamber.”\nTenSoon nodded, dropping his body to the floor and absorbing the\nwolfhound’s bones again. Only seconds passed before he’d restored\nhimself, save for the hair. That started to sprout from the skin as TenSoon\nmoved to the door, coming in waves as the kandra’s body arranged it and\npushed it out.\nWax grabbed his lantern and they fled, TenSoon again leading the way.\n* * *\n“There he goes, boys!” Wayne yelled, pointing into the darkness. “I saw\nthat dirty conner right ahead. You go that way, I’ll head around the other\nway, and we’ll trap ’im between us, we will!”\nThe small force of men with him—armed with wrenches and brooms—\nsplit off in a cheering, clangorous mass of spit and vengeance. Wayne egged\nthem on while backward-jogging in the other direction. Eventually he\nslowed, finally alone, and shook his head. Not bad fellows, for all the fact\nthat they had the combined wits of a brick.\nWayne spun a dueling cane in his fingers, rounding back through an\nalleyway and popping out near the governor’s mansion. He didn’t go\ntoward the front—more and more angry people were gathering there, and\nsome might recognize him from before. On his head he wore a newsboy’s\ncap, his other hat carefully stowed in a bush along the way. That was fine;\nhe liked this new cap well enough, but he felt naked in another way—he\nwas out of bendalloy. Completely dry.\nThat was bad. No more stopping time unless Wax had an extra vial for\nhim. The fellow often carried one.\nWayne slipped around the mansion, intending to head toward the back\ndoors, where he hoped the guards would let him in. He’d wasted time, far\ntoo much, getting away from that crowd. The sight of that poor kandra\nmelting in front of everyone else haunted him.\nRusts.

Besides, for\nthe moment he figured he’d choose the side that wasn’t actively trying to\nkill him.\nHe strolled and stuck a new ball of gum into his mouth. Then he\nhesitated, mists swirling around him, the mansion looming before him like a\nmesa in the Roughs, lit up all white. He heard a voice drifting toward him.\nThe accent was wrong. Just slightly wrong, but in a profound way.\nAnd suddenly he knew who Bleeder was impersonating.\n* * *\nThe howls were distant from Wax, but they haunted him more than they had\nduring the first chase, for now he knew what made them. If he survived this,\nhe would have to see something done for these creatures.\nTenSoon conducted them through the intestines of the Homeland,\neventually reaching a wall full of cracks. Wax raised his lantern, inspecting\nit. The wolfhound beside him had a pelt that was missing hair in patches.\n“Well?” Wax said, inspecting the dead end.\n“We have been watching this spot,” TenSoon said. “It cracked long ago,\nand the cracks seem to have widened over the years. If it opens, it will\nprovide another path into the Homeland, and we wish to be aware of each\nof those.”\nWax ran his fingers along the cracks in the stone wall. Air moved\nthrough them, he thought, catching a whiff of something more … rotten.\nMore like the city he knew. Familiar and disgusting all at once.\nHe tapped his metalmind, increasing his weight, then threw his shoulder\nagainst the wall. This was tricky, as his strength hadn’t increased except in\nits ability to lift his own limbs and manipulate his heavier muscles. That\nlent him some ability, but mostly he had to try to force things just right so\nthat he was falling into the wall as much as pushing on it.\nHe finally got the correct leverage, shoving through the cracked rock\nand causing a clatter. He was able to pick his way through into a narrow rift,\nlike a very thin slot canyon out in the Roughs. The walls were slick with\nwater, and knobby as in so much of this underground realm.\n“What now?” Wax asked.\n“Now we climb, human,” TenSoon said. He melted again, dumping his\nbones and fur to the ground, becoming a group of muscles. Here, in these\nnarrow confines, that was an advantage. TenSoon was able to push on both\nwalls and start sliding up the crack, filling holes and clefts with his mass,\nthen using his muscles to propel himself upward. A bag, like a stomach, had\nformed around the wolfhound bones, and he carted these up behind him.\nIt was grotesque yet fascinating. This was the natural state of the kandra,\nthe sludgelike collection of muscles that at times acted human.\nOf course, Wax thought, starting to climb, what am I but a pile of blood\nand meat that gets up and walks around?\nThis climb was difficult, particularly with the lantern, though decreasing\nhis weight substantially helped. After only a short time, he heard the\ncreatures come in below, howling and scrambling. His heart beat more"

After only a short time, he heard the\ncreatures come in below, howling and scrambling. His heart beat more\nquickly, but they didn’t seem to have much luck climbing. He continued to\ninch upward, until—in his haste for a handhold—he fumbled with the\nlantern and dropped it.\nIt bumped and clanged against the stones before smashing down below.\nThe light went out.\nIn that moment, Wax realized he was buried in the earth, clinging to\nrocks in the darkness. The walls seemed to press against him, and twisted\nmonsters howled below and sought his blood. He gasped in sudden panic.\nThen his eyes adjusted and a soft blue light revealed the world to him.\nHe wasn’t trapped. There was a way out above. He could see it by the\npatina of blue fungus growing on the walls, giving a gentle light to\neverything.\n“Harmony made sure it spread here,” TenSoon’s voice said from above.\n“He wanted to make certain that no person was ever trapped in darkness in\nthis place again.”\nWax forced himself to continue upward. He recognized where he was\nnow, from the stories. The holes in the walls that he used as handholds had\nonce been overgrown with crystals, and within, geodes containing a bead of\nthe lost metal. Legendary atium.\nHe was climbing the Pits of Hathsin themselves.\n“Peace, lawman,” TenSoon said from above. “Keep climbing.”\nHad he heard Wax’s breathing quicken? He steadied himself and\ncontinued. This place was no longer a prison. No more did it cut and\nlacerate, as it had done to the Survivor’s arms. The climb was actually easy,\nwith all those holes. The sounds from below grew softer.\nFinally, he crawled from the crevice into a section of man-made tunnel.\nOne of the city sewers; the crack behind him was just a thin cleft in the rock\nthat gave no hint of its ancient origin. Wax shivered, breathing in the awful\nstench of the sewers, but still glad to be free. TenSoon convulsed as a mass\nnearby, then formed into a wolfhound again. “I can see why Paalm might\nwant me distracted and unable to stop my people from being caught in her\ntrap,” he said. “But what happened below, that was not for me, but you,\nhuman. What was she trying to distract you from?”\nWax didn’t reply, but could think of only one reason. Once she dealt\nwith the kandra, her plan would be ready for the final steps. She’d need to\ndrive the people of the city further into a frenzy, freeing them, as she saw it,\nsending them forth as a mob to rage and hate, destroying Elendel.\nThe governor was planning to speak to the people of the city. Bleeder\nhadn’t succeeded in killing him yet, and Wax suspected he knew why.\nBecause when she murdered him, she wanted an audience.\nPART THREE\n22\nMist seemed to burn in the night, like clouds before the sun. Wax dropped\nthrough it, slamming to the steps of the governor’s mansion, surprising the\nguards there. Constables, by the uniforms, rather than the normal guards.\nGood. They’d been running low on the latter."

They’d been running low on the latter.\nWax stood up straight, turning and regarding the crowd gathering in\nfront of the mansion. Constables with rifles made an uneasy barrier between\nthem and the building. Nearby, workers erected a small stage on the steps.\nAradel supervised, though judging from his sour expression, he was rather\ndispleased with the governor’s plan.\nWax agreed. Addressing the crowd would be playing right into\nBleeder’s hands. He grabbed one of the constables. “I assume there hasn’t\nbeen another attempt on the governor’s life?”\n“No, sir,” the constable said. “He’s in his study, sir.”\nWax nodded and barged into the mansion, trailing wisps of mist behind\nhim. He stalked toward the back, and in the hallway Marasi intercepted\nhim, taking him by the arm. “Kolossblood,” she said, giving him the\npassword he’d given her, proving she wasn’t a kandra.\n“Nighttime Summer,” Wax said back, authenticating himself. “You need\nto do something about that crowd, Marasi. They’re going to rip this city\ndown.”\n“We’re working on it. Have you seen Wayne?”\n“No. Why?”\n“MeLaan says he went out to inspect the protesters. That was over half\nan hour ago. Nobody has seen him since.”\n“He’ll turn up,” Wax said. “I need to talk to the governor.”\nMarasi nodded, but held on to his arm as he tried to walk toward the\nstudy. “Wax,” she said softly, “he’s corrupt. Really corrupt. I’ve found\nproof.”\nWax drew in a deep breath. “Let’s survive this night. Then we’ll do\nsomething about that.”\n“My thoughts are similar,” Marasi said, “but I think Bleeder wants to\nput us in a difficult position—perhaps she wants to force us to let the\ngovernor die.”\n“Not going to happen,” Wax said. “We’ll hand him over to the courts,\nbut not a mob. Have you checked on your sister?”\n“No,” Marasi said. “But I’ve been intending to.”\n“Do so,” Wax said. “I’ll look in on your father after talking to the\ngovernor. I don’t want either showing up as an unexpected hostage.”\n“As long as it isn’t me, for a change,” Marasi said with a grimace.\n“MeLaan is wearing the body of the guard with the sling. She’s furious the\ngovernor won’t let her or the others in. I’m going to go see if I can track\ndown Wayne; wouldn’t be surprised to find him on the front row of the\nmob.”\nShe let go of his arm and headed toward the exit.\n“Marasi,” Wax said after her.\n“Hm?”\n“The uniform,” he said. “It suits you. Don’t know if I’ve had a chance to\nmention that.”\nShe blushed—she was Marasi after all—before continuing. Wax turned\nand strode down the hallway toward the door to the governor’s study.\nMeLaan lounged there with a group of three other guards."

Wax turned\nand strode down the hallway toward the door to the governor’s study.\nMeLaan lounged there with a group of three other guards.\n“Nobody is to enter, lawman,” one of them said with an annoyed tone.\n“He’s been in there composing a speech for the last hour. He won’t—”\nWax walked past them and tried the door, which was locked. He could\nhear Innate’s voice inside, going over a speech. Wax increased his weight\nand flung the door open with Allomancy, splintering the doorframe. Innate\nstood inside, holding a pad of paper and pacing as he talked. He froze\nmidstride and spun on Wax, then relaxed visibly.\n“You could have knocked,” the governor said.\n“And you could have ignored a knock,” Wax said, walking in and\nswinging the door shut behind him. It didn’t latch, of course, after what\nWax had done. “What do you think you’re doing, Innate? You could have\nbeen killed in here, quietly, alone without anyone to help.”\n“And what would they have done?” Innate demanded, tossing his pad\nonto his desk. He walked up, then spoke more softly: “Wind’s whisper.”\n“Drunken steam,” Wax said back, latest passphrases exchanged. Innate\nwas authentic. “Locking your guards out was foolhardy. They would have\nfought for you, protected you. We chased her off one time before.”\n“You chased her off,” Innate said, walking back to his desk and picking\nup his pad. “The rest were useless. Even poor Drim.” He went back to his\npacing, speaking the lines of his speech to himself and practicing emphasis.\nWax fumed, feeling dismissed. This was the man they struggled to\nprotect? Wax made his way to the window. It was open, surprisingly, letting\nin wisps of mist. They didn’t travel far. He’d heard legends of the mists\nfilling rooms, but that rarely happened.\nHe leaned against the window, looking out at the darkness, listening\nwith half an ear to Innate’s speech. It was inflammatory and dismissive. He\nclaimed to feel the problems the people had, but called them peasants.\nThis would just make things worse. She wants that, Wax thought. She\nwants to free the city from Harmony by making it angry.\nShe knew what Innate was going to say. Of course she knew. She’d\nbeen leading them around this entire time. Every clue Wax had found so far\nhad been carefully planted for him. So what did he do? Stop Innate’s\nspeech? What if that was what she wanted?\nHe tapped his finger on the windowsill. Tap. Tap.\nSquish.\nHe looked down, then blinked. A wad of chewed gum had been stuck\nhere. Wax lifted his finger, and—as he contemplated it—something started\nto fall into place. Something he’d been missing. Bleeder had set this all up\nfrom the start.\nWax’s suspicions had begun because she’d deliberately alerted him by\nwearing Bloody Tan’s face. That had been a conscious ploy on her part, a\nway to start the festivities. Everything was moving on her timetable.\nBleeder had had everything already in place when this night arrived."

Far longer than he’d assumed.\nSo where was the best place to hide?\nRusts.\nWax reached for his gun and spun.\nHe found himself facing down Governor Innate, who had taken out a\nsidearm and leveled it. “Damn it, Wax,” the governor said. “Just a few\nminutes more and I’d have had this. You see too far. You can always see a\nlittle too far.”\nWax froze there, hand on his gun. He met the governor’s eyes, and\nhissed out slowly. “You knew the passphrase,” Wax whispered, “but of\ncourse you did. I gave it to you. When did you kill him? How long has the\ncity been ruled by an impostor?”\n“Long enough.”\n“The governor wasn’t your target. You think bigger than that—I should\nhave seen. But Drim … He was in the saferoom when you entered below. Is\nthat why you killed him? No. He’d have known you were gone.”\n“He knew all along,” Bleeder said. “He was mine. But tonight, I killed\nhim because of you, Wax. You’d shot me up…”\n“You had on the governor’s clothing underneath the cloak,” Wax said.\n“Rusts! I’d bloodied you. So you needed an excuse for why the governor\nwas covered in blood, an excuse to pull off your shirt and stanch a wound.”\nShe held the gun on him, immobile. The weapon didn’t register to his\nAllomancy. Aluminum. She was prepared, of course. But she seemed torn.\nShe didn’t want to kill him. She’d never wanted to kill him, for some\nreason.\nSo Wax yelled for help.\nIt was risky, but nothing ever ended well when you obeyed the person\nwith the gun on you. As he’d suspected, Bleeder didn’t shoot at him as the\ndoor burst open. Wax pulled out his gun and fired at Bleeder, to distract her\nas he dug in his gunbelt for the last needle that MeLaan had given him.\nThe guards turned their guns toward Wax and started firing.\nIdiot, he thought, throwing himself toward the governor’s desk for\ncover. Of course they’d do that. “Wait!” he said. “The governor has been\ntaken. Don’t—”\nBleeder gunned down the guards. Wax rolled behind the desk, but still\nheard it as they cried out in shock, their own governor—so far as they knew\n—shooting them down. Wax winced, cursing. Those deaths were upon him.\n“I guess the rest of the constables will be upon us soon,” Bleeder said.\n“They’re not free yet. Neither are you, despite how I’ve tried.…”\nWax peeked up over the desk, then ducked down again as she swung the\ngun toward him. The governor’s face was twisted in a mask of anger and\nfrustration.\n“Why couldn’t you have given me a little longer?” she demanded. “So\nclose.

Best to take\nadvantage of that.\n“MeLaan, go!” Wax shouted, then Pushed on the nails in the floor,\nflinging himself up into the air.\nOne of the corpses at Bleeder’s feet grabbed her around the legs.\nWax Pushed off the wall, leaping toward Bleeder. She growled, then\nslapped his hand as he landed, knocking the needle free. Rusts, she was\nstrong. She kicked MeLaan off as Wax dove for the fallen needle.\nShe became a blur. As he tried to grab the needle, Bleeder snatched it\nand spun around, slamming it down into MeLaan’s shoulder. It was done in\nan eyeblink.\nThen she lurched to a stop. She seemed jarred by the motion. Her\nmetalmind storage, at long last, had run dry.\nWax pulled out his gun and fired, lying with his back on the floor. The\nbullets ripped her skin, but did nothing else. Nearby, MeLaan’s shape\ndistorted—face drooping and the skin going transparent.\nWax lay on the ground, his emptied gun pointed at Bleeder, whose skin\nre-formed from the wounds. They stared at one another for an extended\nmoment before boots in the hallway outside made Bleeder curse, then dash\nfor the window. Wax grabbed his other gun, following, then threw himself\ndown as shots sounded outside.\nHe waited a moment, then glanced up, but didn’t spot her in the swirling\nmists. Wax cursed, rolling his arm in its socket. Rusts. That bullet hole he’d\ntaken earlier in the night was bleeding again, and the pain was returning. He\nthought he’d chewed enough painkiller to keep it away.\n“You all right?” he asked MeLaan, who had managed to sit up.\n“Yeah,” she said, though the word was mangled by her melted face. “I\nmade them do this to me once to test it out. I’ll be fine in a few minutes.”\n“Thanks for the save,” Wax said, anxiously scanning the room for\nhidden compartments with his steelsight. Quivering lines in the closet.\nCould he be so lucky? He rushed over and yanked it open.\nWayne—tied securely and gagged—tumbled out and hit the floor with a\nthump. He was alive, thank Harmony. Wax knelt down, sighed in relief, and\nloosened the gag. Wayne looked like he’d been stabbed in the leg, and his\nmetalminds had been stripped away so he couldn’t heal, but he was alive.\n“Wax!” Wayne said. “It’s the governor. Bugger’s got the same ‘a’ as\nMeLaan!”\n“I know,” Wax said. “You’re lucky. She probably wanted to harvest your\nMetalborn abilities with spikes, otherwise she’d have killed you right off.\nWhy didn’t you warn anyone?”\n“Was going to, but I needed to check first.

He held it up as a tense set of\nconstables, led by Marasi, piled into the room.\nThe newcomers called for an explanation. Wax left them to interrogate\nWayne, instead seeking the mists once more.\n23\nWax was a bullet in the night, rushing through the mists and disturbing\nthem with his passing. He had become the hunter rather than the game,\nthough the transition might have taken too long. He soared upward first to\nget a view of the area. An ever-growing crowd surrounded the governor’s\nmansion. Roaring. Calling for change, or perhaps just blood.\nWould he bring down Bleeder only to find her victorious in a city\ndestroyed?\nHe couldn’t worry about that at the moment. Instead he sought signs,\nclues, a story. Nobody passed, even at night, without leaving a trail. Perhaps\nit would be too faint for him to locate, but it would exist.\nThere. A group of people pulling away from the mansion, instead of\ncrowding toward it. Wax landed in a storm, mistcoat flaring. This was the\nmansion’s garden, near a large workers’ shed. Wax studied the pattern of\npeople moving away.\nThe gunfire just a moment ago, he thought. It wasn’t to shoot someone,\nbut to clear the crowd. She was out of Feruchemical speed and fleeing\nfrantically, and had opened fire into the air to clear this pocket of people. As\nhe listened he picked out cries of confusion, some people claiming the\nconstables had opened fire on the crowd. Others claimed they’d seen the\ngovernor himself running, trying to escape the mansion.\nWax loaded Vindication with the single bullet Ranette had sent, placing\nit in one of the special chambers he could quickly spin to at will. Then he\ninched open the door to the shed, crouching beside the doorway so as to not\npresent a profile. The mists were bright with torchlight this night, but that\nlight didn’t penetrate to the dark shed. Wax searched through the shadows,\nuntil he saw something.\nA bone? Yes, and draped over it cloth. He picked out a fallen cravat, a\nwhite buttoning shirt … the governor’s clothing. Bleeder had stashed\nanother body in here, and had fled to swap into it.

If he could find Bleeder in midtransformation …\n“I can still free you,” a voice whispered from the darkness inside.\n“Perhaps I have lost the city, but I didn’t come here for them. Not at first. I\ncame for you.”\n“Why me?” Wax asked, searching furiously through the darkness, palm\nsweating as he held Vindication. “Damn it, creature, why me?”\n“I have deafened him,” Bleeder whispered. “I have cut out his tongue,\npierced his eyes, but still he can act. You are his hands, Waxillium Ladrian.\nHe may be deaf, blind, and mute … but still, with you, he can move his\npawns.”\n“I’m my own man, Bleeder,” Wax said, finally spotting what he thought\nwas her silhouette, crouched at the back of the dusty chamber, beside a rack\nof shovels. “Perhaps I serve Harmony, but I do so because I wish it.”\n“Ah,” she whispered. “Do you know, Wax, how long he cultivated you?\nHow long he teased you, led you by the nose? How he sent you to be\nhardened by the Roughs, so he could draw you back in once you had aged\nproperly, like leather being cured.…”\nWax raised Vindication, but the side of the building burst outward,\nshowering pieces of wood across the lawn. Wax tried to draw a bead on her,\nbut didn’t fire, and Bleeder ducked out. He had to be very careful with this\nshot. Ranette had sent but one bullet, and only it would matter in this fight.\nBleeder fled into the night and launched into the air. The breaking wall\nhad been an indication, but this was confirmation. Her metalmind, drained\nof the speed she’d stored up, was now useless. She’d left it on the ground\nbeside the governor’s bones, and had become a Coinshot instead.\nWax followed, Pushing on the same nails, sending himself into the sky.\nHe could see why she’d chosen to become a Coinshot; Steelpushing lent\ngreat maneuverability and speed, and logically gave her the best chance of\nescaping.\nThere was a problem with that, of course.\nSteel was his domain.\n* * *\nThe pile of bones on the floor of the little shack proved that at least one\nperson was having a worse night than Wayne was. He nudged the pile with\nhis toe, then grimaced at his wounded leg. Rusting inconvenient, that was.\nHe had to grab the wall for support.\nHe looked toward Marasi. “I can’t decide,” he said, “if the governor\nalready bein’ dead means we did a really terrible job, or a really good one.”\n“How,” Marasi replied, kneeling beside the corpse, “could you see this\nas anything other than terrible?”\n“Well, see, we weren’t the ones what was in charge of keepin’ him alive\nwhen he died.” Wayne shrugged. “Guess anytime I find a corpse and it ain’t\nmy fault they’re dead, I feel a little relieved.”"

Angry, waiting for the governor to give them his\nspeech. The speech that was supposed to stop all this.\n“Bleeder was planning to outrage them,” MeLaan said. “I heard some of\nhis speech. Maybe we can make them disperse?”\n“No,” Marasi said, standing. “We can do better than that.” She turned to\nMeLaan, then nudged the governor’s skull with her foot. “How long will it\ntake you to imitate him?”\n“I didn’t digest his corpse—and don’t wince like that, it’s not my fault\nyou people happen to be edible. If it helps, you taste terrible, even if you’re\nproperly aged. Anyway, it will be tough. TenSoon’s pretty good at re-\ncreating a face from a skull, but I’m way less practiced.”\nWayne didn’t say anything. He could shut it. Damn right he could shut\nit, when he needed to. Even if there was jokes that practically begged to be\nsaid.\n“You have us to help you get it right,” Marasi said to MeLaan. “Plus, it\nwill be dark. You won’t need to fool Innate’s mother, just a crowd of angry\ncitizens, most of whom haven’t seen him up close.”\nMeLaan folded her arms, inspecting the remains. “Fine. If you think you\ncan come up with something for me to say that will placate that crowd, I’ll\ndo it.”\nWayne stood still, jaw clenched. No jokes about … well, the obvious\nthings. Besides, he’d just learned something far worse. Something that was\nno cause for laughter.\nMarasi looked at him, then frowned. “Wayne, what’s wrong?”\nHe sat down, shaking his head.\n“Wayne?” Marasi said, rising, sounding genuinely concerned. “I didn’t"

She knew how to drop\nlow before shoving on a parked motorcar to give herself lateral speed,\nrather than just Pushing herself higher. She was capable.\nWax was more than capable. He followed as a shadow, never more than\na half leap behind her. He sensed an increasingly frantic quality to her\nmotions, flared steel trying to Push herself out of his reach.\nHe let her, at first, trying to run her out of steel. They bounced through\nthe city, two currents in the mist, leaping over roadways clogged with angry\nrioters, past middle-class neighborhoods full of closed shutters and\nextinguished lights, over the grounds of the rich—whose security forces\nstood tensely by gates, waiting for this hellish night to end.\nWax confirmed to himself as they flew that Bleeder had not been the\nMarksman. She’d worn one of his masks earlier—and seemed to be doing\nso again, from the quick glance he got as she passed a burning building in\nthe night—but she did so to consternate and confuse him. Marks had sought\nthe insides of rooms as he ran, trying to set up an ambush. She kept to the\nopen spaces, as if frightened of the indoors. No running toward skyscrapers,\nno seeking the cramped confines of the slums. Instead, she headed directly\neast from the governor’s mansion, toward the freedom of the outer city.\nThere wouldn’t be nearly so much metal out there, making it difficult\nfor her to flee—but also removing some of his advantage. He couldn’t let\nthat happen.\nAs they chased past a late train, Wax redoubled his efforts. He\nanticipated her turn as she cut away from the train toward an industrial\nquarter, and he cut sideways, earning a few seconds. As she leaped over a\nsquat, burning building—passing protesters who threw rocks at her from\nbelow—Wax skimmed between it and the building beside it, coming around\nthe other side in a precise turn. He passed through boiling smoke and\nemerged, gun out, as she came down from a more graceful arc.\nThat earned a curse from her as she saw him. She flung herself down a\nstreet, using each passing light as another source to Push off, increasing her\nspeed. It was done with deftness, but Wax had an advantage.

As always, though the change was\nsometimes subtle, this increased his velocity. If he decreased his weight\nwhile in motion, he got a little burst of speed. He didn’t know why.\nIn a chase such as this, shoving off each light that passed, little\nadvantages like that added up. Each cut corner, each careful judge of an arc,\neach use of the speed boost in flight after landing for a moment, sent him\ncloser to her. To the point that as they neared the edge of the city, she\nglanced backward and found him about to grab her heels.\nShe cried out, a feminine exclamation of surprise. She shoved herself to\nthe side, passing out over the river, and managed to land on the roadway\nportion of the Eastbridge, holding on to one of the support wires.\nWax landed gracefully before her, gun out. “You can’t run from me,\nBleeder. Let me remove your spike and take you prisoner. Perhaps the\nothers can find a way, someday, to heal your madness.”\n“And become a slave again,” she whispered behind the red and white\nmask. “Would you clasp the manacles willingly on your own hands?”\n“If I had done the horrible things that you have, then yes. I would\ndemand to be taken in.”\n“And what of the god you serve? When will Harmony accept his\npunishments? The people he lets die. The people he makes die.”\nWax raised his gun, but Bleeder launched herself upward.\nWax trailed her with his weapon, but she bounced back and forth\nbetween massive bridge support beams, and he did not fire. Instead he lifted\nhimself with a Push, soaring up—coat flapping—until he reached the top of\none of the bridge’s suspension towers. Bleeder waited here, atop the\npinnacle, dressed in her red shirt and trousers, a loose cape blowing around\nher.\nWax landed and leveled the gun.\nBleeder dropped the mask.\nShe wore Lessie’s face.\n* * *\nMarasi didn’t tell the other constables, even Aradel, the truth about Innate.\nWhat would she have said? “Sorry, but the man we’ve been protecting was\nactually the killer”? “Oh, and the city has been run by an insane kandra for\nwho knows how long”? She’d make a report soon, once she knew how to\nexplain it, but for now she didn’t have time. She needed to save the city.\nShe still felt a stab of guilt as she stood near the flimsy stage at the front\nof the steps, where she watched Captain Aradel pass her. The lord high\nconstable looked visibly sick as he paced. The predicament she’d placed\nhim in, with regards to thinking the governor was a crook, troubled him\ndeeply.\nNearby, MeLaan stepped up onto the stage to address the crowd.\nThough she critiqued her own shortcomings, in Marasi’s estimation her\nimitation of the governor was excellent.\nThe crowd grew quiet. Marasi frowned. Had Aradel’s men prompted\nthat somehow? No … the constables stood in a tight line between the crowd\nand the mansion, but weren’t doing anything to quell the crowd.\nHow odd.

The former rioters genuinely wanted to hear what the governor\nhad to say. Well, why shouldn’t they?\nMarasi felt their mood, one of hostile curiosity. She felt a calmness too.\nMeLaan’s speech would work. Everything was fine. Why had she been so\nworried earlier? It …\nRusts. She was being Soothed.\nShe snapped alert, suddenly tense. She knew crowds. She’d studied mob\ndynamics. It was her specialty—and she could tell, easily, that something\nwas wrong here. But who was Soothing? Why? How?\nSuit, she thought. Waxillium had said the Set was involved. His uncle\nhad access to Allomancers, and an inclination to see that Bleeder’s plans\ncame to fruition. It didn’t matter what Marasi had written for MeLaan to\nsay; when Suit’s men discovered that “the governor” was deviating from the\nscript, they’d drive the crowd to a frenzy.\nSuddenly frantic, Marasi didn’t listen to the beginning of MeLaan’s\nspeech. Could she get to Aradel? No, he was standing on the rusting stage,\nnear MeLaan. Wayne, putting on a brave face despite his wound, hovered\nnear the two of them, ready to help if something went wrong.\nMarasi had to move quickly, and quietly, not alerting the Set. She\nspotted Reddi standing near the base of the steps, watching the crowd with\narms folded. Marasi scrambled over to him and seized his arm.\n“Reddi,” she said. “There’s a Soother in this crowd somewhere.”\n“What?” he asked absently, glancing at her. “Hmm?”\n“A Soother,” Marasi said. “Dampening our emotions. Probably a Rioter\nwaiting too, to drive the crowd into a frenzy once they hear the speech.”\n“Don’t be silly,” Reddi said with a yawn. “Everything is fine,\nLieutenant.”\n“Reddi,” she said, tightening her grip. “How do you feel?”\n“Fine.”\n“Not annoyed at me?” she said. “Not angry that I hold the position you\nshould? Not jealous at all?”\nHe glared at her, then cocked his head. Then he hissed out softly.\n“Damn it, you’re right. I usually hate you, but all I feel is a mild dislike.\nSomeone’s playing with my emotions.” He hesitated. “No offense.”\n“Can’t feel offense,” Marasi said. “I’m having trouble feeling any strong\nemotion or urgency. But Reddi, we have to stop them.”\n“I’ll get a squad,” he said. “How will we find them though? They could\nbe anywhere.”\n“No,” Marasi said, scanning the crowd. Her eyes found a carriage\nparked discreetly in a small alleyway across from the governor’s square.\n“Not anywhere. They won’t want to mix with the masses that they’re\nplanning to turn into a murderous mob. Too dangerous. Come on.”\n25"

The\nsound of a man getting hit straight in the stomach with a well-driven punch.\nHe held the gun on Bleeder, but his hand wavered, and his vision shook.\nIt’s not her. It’s not her.\n“Again with the guns,” Bleeder said softly. Rusts! It was Lessie’s voice.\n“You lean on them too much, Wax. You’re a Coinshot. How often do I have\nto point that out?”\n“You dug up her corpse?” Wax asked in a pleading voice. He was\nhaving trouble seeing straight. “You monster. You dug up her corpse?”\n“I wish I hadn’t been forced to do this,” Les—Bleeder said. “But strong\nemotion frees us from him, Wax. It’s the only way.”\nShe stared down that gun. Of course she would. She was a kandra. He\nhad to remind himself of that forcibly. The gun meant nothing to her.\nLessie … How often had he dreamed of hearing that voice again? He’d\nwept for the wish to tell her one last time of his love. To explain the hole,\ngaping like the wound from a shotgun blast, left in him by her death.\nTo apologize.\nHarmony. I can’t shoot her again.\nBleeder had outthought him after all.\n“I worried about using Tan’s body,” Lessie said, stepping toward him.\n“Worried it would make you figure out who I really was.”\n“You’re not Lessie.”\nShe grimaced. “Yeah, I guess that’s true. I was never Lessie. Always\nPaalm the kandra. But I wanted to be Lessie. Does that count for anything?”\nRusts … she had Lessie’s mannerisms down exactly. MeLaan had said\nshe was good, but this was so real, so believable. He found himself\nlowering his gun, wishing. Wishing …\nHarmony? he begged.\nBut he didn’t have his earring in.\n* * *\nMarasi and Reddi wrapped around, moving over a block before coming\nback in behind the suspicious carriage. They hadn’t been able to gather as\nlarge a force as she’d wanted—not only did they worry about the Soother\nnoticing the motion, Reddi was concerned about leaving too few people\nwatching the crowd.\nMeLaan’s voice carried through the voice projectors, audible even as\nMarasi and her team of eleven men set up near the far end of the alleyway\ncontaining the carriage. How long before the Set noticed they’d been had?\nProbably not long. Marasi had left in some of the beginning part of the\nspeech, in order to not sound too different from Innate, but the speech\nwould take a turn very soon.\nReddi pulled off his constable’s helmet—Marasi’s own pressed against\nher hair, an uncomfortable weight—then nodded to the rest of them in the\ndarkness. With his aluminum-lined helmet off, he could feel the Soother’s\ntouch more powerfully here than he had out in the crowd. That carriage\nreally was the source of it.\nHe put the helmet back on.

The precinct owned only a dozen of these,\nall donated by Waxillium. Reddi had just enough clout to requisition the\ntask force that had them. He secured his helmet, then reached to his side,\ntaking out a thick dueling cane like a long baton with a knob on the end.\nThe others did the same. There would be no gunplay this close to a crowd\nof civilians.\n“We go in quickly and quietly,” Reddi whispered to the team. “Hope to\nHarmony they don’t have a Coinshot with them. Keep your helmets on. I\ndon’t want that Soother taking control of any of you.”\nMarasi cocked an eyebrow. Soothers couldn’t control people, though\nmany mistook that. It didn’t help that the Words of Founding spoke vaguely\nof kandra and koloss being controlled by Allomancy, but Marasi now knew\nthat was only possible for someone who bore Hemalurgic spikes.\n“Colms,” Reddi said, still speaking in a low voice, “stay at the back.\nYou’re not a field agent. I don’t want you getting hurt or, worse, messing\nthis up.”\n“As you wish,” she said.\nReddi counted softly. On ten, the group of them surged into the misted\nalleyway. Marasi hung near the back, walking with hands clasped behind\nher. Almost immediately after entering the alleyway, the constables pulled\nto a stop. A force of men in dark clothing piled out of a doorway inside the\nalley, blocking off access to the little carriage.\nMarasi’s heart pounded as the two groups regarded one another. At least\nthis proved she’d been right about the carriage. A few of the newcomers\ncarried guns, but a barked word from one of the dark-clothed men made\nthem tuck those away.\nThey don’t want to draw the crowd’s attention from the speech, Marasi\nthought. They still think what the governor is saying plays into their plans.\nKeeping this fight quiet would serve both sides. The two groups stood\nwaiting, tense, before Reddi waved his dueling cane.\nThe two forces crashed into one another.\n* * *\nBleeder stepped closer to Wax in the mists. Atop this high platform, this\ntower on the bridge, nothing else seemed to exist. It was as if they stood on\na tiny steel island rising from the sea. Grey all around, darkness extending\ninto vastness above.\n“Maybe I should have come to you,” Lessie’s voice said. “And had you\nhelp me with my plan. But he was watching. He’s always watching. I’m\nglad you took the earring out. At least my words meant something to you.”\n“Stop,” Wax whispered. “Please.”\n“Stop what?” Lessie asked, mere inches from him. “Stop walking? Stop\ntalking? Stop loving you? My life would have been a lot easier if I’d been\nable to do that.”\nWax seized her with his open hand, grabbing her by the neck, thumb\nalong her jaw. She met his eyes, and he saw pity in them.\n“Perhaps,” she said, “the reason I didn’t come to you had no connection\nto Harmony at all. I knew this would hurt you. I’m sorry.”"

He followed you here, to help you in the city.\nFor that I love him. But he’s still Harmony’s, and so he’s probably better\ndead than the way he is now.”\nNO!\nWax shoved her back, lifting Vindication again. The gun, however,\nleaped from his fingers—Pushed by Bleeder. It tumbled into the mists.\nWax growled, ramming his shoulder into Bleeder, trying to toss her off\nthe tower. She seized him as he hit, throwing them both off balance.\nAs they fell together, she raised her aluminum gun and shot him in the\nleg.\nHe cried out as they fell from the tower, dropping through the mists. A\nfrantic Push on the bridge below slowed Wax, but when he hit, his leg gave\nout and he screamed, dropping to one knee.\nGun. Find the gun.\nIt had fallen this way. Rusts. Would it even work after dropping so far?\nHe hadn’t heard it hit. Did that mean it had plunged into the waters?\nBleeder landed hard nearby. She spun on him, lit now by the garish\nelectric lights that lined the roadway of the bridge. It was empty of\ncarriages and motorcars, and behind her, a greater light hovered over the\ncity. Red, violent light, seeming to burn the mists.\nLooking out of the city, he saw darkness and peace.

Watching it made her sick, anxious. Those\nmen were her colleagues, struggling frantically to push through the Set’s\nthugs. All night they’d been forced to stand and watch the city decompose\naround them, the situation growing worse and worse as they felt helpless.\nThis was something they could fight, so fight they did, cracking heads,\nshoving down enemies, grunting in the dirty, dark alleyway in an effort to\nreach the carriage. Thankfully, the Set troops here didn’t appear to include\nany Coinshots or Pewterarms.\nHer men were still outnumbered, and for all their determination they\nweren’t making much headway.

She had said she didn’t have time to\nprepare this imitation properly, and it wasn’t her specialty in the first place.\nRusts. The crowd started to shout, cursing the governor’s lies. MeLaan’s\nvoice faltered. Was this the Rioter, whipping the crowd into a frenzy? Or\nwere the people so angry, they were overcoming the Allomancy?\nEither way, Marasi couldn’t help feeling desperate as her men struggled\nand fell, the crowd building toward a full-on riot. She made her way along\nthe side of the alley, hoping that if she got to that carriage she could make a\ndifference. Unfortunately, the alley’s confines were too narrow, and\ncombatants filled the entire thing. Already half her men were down. Those\nwho fought looked like wraiths, shifting and undulating in the mists.\nShadows trying to consume shadows.\nNobody on either side seemed to pay her much attention. That was\ncommon. For most of her life, her father had wished that she would vanish.\nThose in high society were very good at pretending she didn’t exist. Even\nWaxillium seemed to forget she was along sometimes.\nWell, so be it. She took a deep breath, and strode directly into the fight.\nAs she neared two struggling men, she dodged in, as if trying to do\nsomething to help—then flung herself to the side as if she’d been hit. It was\na fair impression, in her opinion.\nShe heard Reddi curse her name from somewhere in the alleyway, but\nnobody came to her rescue. They kept trying very assiduously to kill one\nanother, and so Marasi crept along the ground, crawling in the shadows\nuntil she neared the carriage.\nTwo guards stood here. Drat. She needed to get past them. How?\nShe glanced back toward the fight. It had moved farther up the alley, the\nconstables being forced to retreat before superior numbers. They were\nprobably far enough away that Marasi could try something truly desperate.\nShe used her Allomancy.\nFor a brief moment, she engaged a speed bubble that caught herself and\njust the two guards. She extinguished her metal immediately. Only seconds\nhad passed outside.\nIt was still jarring. The mists seemed to zip with sudden speed around\nthem, and the combatants lurched in their motions. The two guards jumped\nin surprise, looking around. Marasi did her best impression of a corpse.\nThen she flicked on the Allomancy again.\n“Ruin!” one of the guards said. “You see that?”\n“There’s Metalborn among them,” the other said. They both sounded\nvery nervous.\nMarasi gave them another jolt of distorted time.

Wouldn’t you agree?”\nThe two quickly nodded.\n“Yes indeed,” Marasi said. “A true gentlewoman uses the threat of\nviolence instead.

Bleeder leveled her gun at him, but didn’t fire. Perhaps, deep\ndown, a part of the creature had adopted the feelings of the body it wore.\nPerhaps it no longer could tell the difference between its mind and its face.\nWax snatched up Vindication.\n“Please,” Bleeder whispered. “Listen.”\n“You’re wrong about me,” Wax said, spinning the chamber, feeling the\ntrigger, hoping the gun still worked. He looked up at Bleeder and leveled\nthe weapon.\nLooking down those sights, he saw Lessie. His stomach turned again.\n“How am I wrong?” Bleeder asked.\nRusts, she was crying.\n“I’m not Harmony’s hands,” Wax whispered. “I’m His sword.”\nThen he fired.\nBleeder didn’t dodge. Why would she? Guns barely inconvenienced her.\nThis shot took her right in the forehead. Though her head flinched at the\nimpact, she didn’t fall, barely even moved.\nShe stared at him, a little dribble of blood running down beside the\nbridge of her nose, onto her lips. Then her eyes widened.\nHer gun dropped from trembling fingers.\nWe’re weaker than other Hemalurgic creatures, MeLaan had said. Wax\nstruggled to his feet, holding on to the bridge’s side wall for support. Only\ntwo spikes, and we can be taken.\n“No!” Bleeder screeched, falling to her knees. “No!”\nOne spike allowed her to be sapient.

Too much, perhaps? MeLaan was playing a\npart. She was the governor, the role Marasi had given her. It seemed that\nthe kandra had let the form dictate her reactions. Rusts … it wasn’t that she\nwas doing a bad job. She was doing a good job—of being Innate.\nUnfortunately, Innate had always had trouble connecting with the crowds.\n“Fine,” MeLaan said, waving a hand. “Burn the city! See how you feel\nin the morning without homes to live in.”\nMarasi closed her eyes and groaned. Rusts, she was tired. How late was\nit, now?\nThe crowd was growing violent. Time to grab MeLaan and Wayne and\nleave. Their gambit had failed. It had been a long shot in the first place,\nperhaps impossible. This crowd had come for blood. And …\nThe crowd shouted a new set of jeers. Marasi frowned, opening her\neyes. She stood at the south edge of the crowd, near one of the bonfires, and\nwas close enough to the front to make out Constable-General Aradel, who\nhad stepped up beside MeLaan. Likely, he was going to get “the governor”\nto safety.\nInstead Aradel took out his pistol and pointed it at the governor.\nMarasi gaped for a moment. Then she spun on the Soother. “Soothe\nthem!” she said. “Now. With everything you have. Do it, and I give you\nimmunity for what you did tonight.”"

        "text": "them!” she said. “Now. With everything you have. Do it, and I give you\nimmunity for what you did tonight.”\nThe woman eyed Marasi, displaying a craftiness that belied her earlier\nwhining. She seemed to be weighing the offer.\n“I promise it,” Marasi said, “by the Survivor’s spear.”\nThe woman nodded, and a wave went through the crowd—a sudden\nhush. It didn’t quiet them completely, but when Aradel spoke, his voice\ncarried.\n“Replar Innate,” Aradel said. “In the name of the people of this city, and\nby the authority of my station as lord high constable, I arrest you for gross\ncorruption, personal exploitation of this city’s resources, and perjury of\nyour oaths as a civil servant.”\nThe crowd finally stilled completely.\n“What idiocy—” MeLaan began.\n“Men, turn around,” Aradel said. He looked down at his constables.\n“Turn around.”\nThe feeble line of soldiers reluctantly turned to face him, putting their\nbacks to the crowd.\n“What is he doing?” Reddi demanded.\n“Something brilliant,” Marasi said.\nAradel looked over the crowd, still holding a gun to the governor.\n“Tonight, the governor himself declared this city to be in a state of martial\nlaw. That puts the constables in charge, with him at the head. Unfortunately,\nit turns out the governor is a lying bastard.”\nSome of the people began hesitant shouts of agreement.\n“He’s no longer in control,” Aradel said. “Best I can figure, you’re in\ncontrol. So if you’re willing, tonight, the constables stand with you.\n“Now, you all came here to start a riot. Listen! Stop your shouts. I won’t\nstand for rioting or looting. You start burning this city, and I’ll fight you up\nto my last breath. You hear me? We aren’t a mob.”\n“Then what are we?” a call went up, along with a handful of others.\n“We’re the people of Elendel, and we’re tired of being led by a pack of\nrats,” Aradel yelled. “I have proof of at least seven house lords who are\ncorrupt. I mean to see them arrested. Tonight.” Aradel hesitated, then spoke\nlouder, voice carrying and amplified by the cones set up before the stage. “I\ncould use an army to help me, if you’re willing.”\nAs the crowd roared its agreement, Aradel shoved MeLaan into the\nhands of a pair of corporals waiting nearby. They seemed utterly stunned. In\ntruth, Aradel himself seemed a little overwhelmed by what he’d just done.\n“Pure Preservation,” Reddi cursed softly, looking over the excited\ncrowd. “They’re going to turn into a lynch mob.”\n“No,” Marasi said. “They won’t.”\n“How can you be sure?”\n“Because a river is easier to channel than to stop, Reddi,” Marasi said.\nThis could work. She didn’t have much hope for holding the house lords\nand ladies Aradel wanted to arrest, but the governor himself … With those\nletters and MeLaan playing the role … Yes, this could really work.\nShe released the Soother. “You’re free; get out of here. And tell Suit he\nmight want to take an extended vacation during what is coming.”"

Life had taught him never to underestimate\nan enemy you thought you’d downed. One hand on his bleeding leg, he kept\nhis gun trained on the writhing figure until he could sweep her gun away.\nThen he went down on his good knee and rolled her over, making certain\nshe wasn’t covering up another weapon.\nHe found tears streaming from her eyes, mixing with the trickling blood\nfrom the bullet wound. “He’s in my head again, Wax,” she whispered,\ntrembling. “Oh, Ruin, he’s in my head. He’s taking me. I won’t go back to\nhim.”\n“Hush,” Wax said, pulling a second gun from her side and tossing it\naway. “It’s all right.”\n“No,” she cried, grabbing his arm. “No, it’s not. I won’t be his again! I\nwill be me, at the end!”\nBleeder’s trembling increased, her body bucking, as she held to his arm.\nHe frowned as she kept her head thrust forward, meeting his eyes, weeping\nand shuddering. Thrashing.\n“What are you doing?” Wax demanded.\n“Dying. We decided it! We won’t fall again. We found a way out.” She\ncould no longer meet his eyes, and she fell backward, spasming. Eyes\ndilating quickly, skin trembling against the bone.\nWax watched, horrified. He seized her arm. No pulse. She was dying.\nKilling herself.\nCould he stop it?\nWhy would he care to? She was a murderer many times over. This was a\nfitting end. In truth, he empathized with her. Let her take this route, rather\nthan suffering under Harmony’s control. Hesitant, but feeling there was\nlittle else he could do for this poor creature, he picked her up and held her\nclose. Let her die in someone’s arms. It revolted him to do so, after what\nshe had done. But damn it, it was right.\nBleeder turned her head toward him, and her expression softened as she\nshook, smiling through bloodied lips. “You’re … you’re as surprising as\na … dancing donkey, Mister Cravat.”\nWax grew cold. “Where did you hear that? How did you know those\nwords?”\n“I think I loved you even on that day,” she said. “Lawman for hire. So\nridiculous, but so … earnest. You didn’t try to shelter me, but seemed so\neager to impress.… A lord with a purpose.”\n“Who told you of that day, Bleeder?” Wax demanded. “Who…”\n“Ask Harmony,” she said, the trembling growing more violent. “Ask\nhim, Wax! Ask why he sent a kandra to watch over you, all those years ago.\nAsk him if he knew I would come to love you!”\n“No…”\n“He moved us, even then!” she whispered. “I refused. I wouldn’t\nmanipulate you into returning to Elendel! You loved it out there. I wouldn’t\nbring you back, to become his pawn.…”\n“Lessie?” Harmony, it was her.\nIt was her."

There in his lap, he stared at her body. It kept its shape.\nHer shape. He clutched her, and let out a low-pitched howl, from deep\nwithin, a raw shout that echoed into the night.\nIt seemed to drive the mists back.\nHe still knelt there, holding the body, an hour later when a figure loped\nout of the mists and approached on four legs. TenSoon the kandra, Guardian\nof the Ascendant Warrior, approached with a reverent step, wolfhound’s\nhead bowed.\nWax stared out into those shifting mists, holding a corpse, hoping\nirrationally that his heat would keep it warm.\n“Tell me,” Wax said, voice cracking and rough from his shouting. “Tell\nme, kandra.”\n“She was sent to you long ago,” TenSoon said, sitting back on his\nhaunches. “The woman you knew as Lessie was always one of us.”\nNo …\n“Harmony worried about you in the Roughs, lawman,” TenSoon said.\n“He wanted you to have a bodyguard. Paalm had exhibited a willingness to\nbreak prohibitions the rest of us held sacred. He hoped that you two would\nbe good for one another.”\n“You didn’t tell me?” Wax spat, his grip tight. Hatred. He didn’t think\nhe had ever felt hatred so intense as he did at that moment.\n“I was forbidden,” TenSoon said. “MeLaan didn’t know; I was only\ninformed a few days ago. Harmony foresaw a disaster if you were told\nwhom you hunted.”\n“And this isn’t a disaster, kandra?”\nTenSoon turned away. They sat there on that empty bridge, electric\nlights making pockets in the mist, a dead woman in Wax’s lap.\n“I killed her,” Wax whispered, squeezing his eyes closed. “I killed her\nagain.”\nEPILOGUE\nWax sat alone in a room full of people. They’d done everything to make\nhim comfortable. A warm fire on the hearth, a small lamp on the table\nbeside it, for Steris knew he preferred flame to electricity. Broadsheets lay\nuntouched in a roll beside a cup of tea that had long since grown cold.\nThey talked and celebrated, led by Lord Harms, who laughed and\nexclaimed about his minor part in it all. A disaster averted. A new governor\n—the first ever who was not of noble blood. Even the Lord Mistborn, long\nago, had been part nobleman. The Last Emperor had been full-blooded, and\nthe Survivor half nobleman. All great people, everyone agreed, to be\nlauded.\nBut Claude Aradel had none of the same lineage. Not a drop of noble\nblood in him.

        "text": "progressive as to speak favorably of one who was common-born.\nWax stared into the fire, fingering at the stubble on his chin. He spoke\nwhen it was required of him, but mostly they allowed him his peace. He\nwas wrung out, Steris told them. Fatigued by the terrible things he’d seen.\nShe diverted them from him when she could, telling them—when they\ninevitably asked—that she and he had decided to delay the wedding so Wax\ncould take a short vacation to recuperate.\nPartway through the event, Wayne sauntered over on crutches. He\ncouldn’t heal without storing up more health—and he couldn’t do that while\nhealing from his wound, or it would defeat the purpose. For now, he had to\ndeal with the fragility of the body, just like a normal person.\nWe’re all so fragile, when you consider it, Wax thought. One little thing\ngoes wrong, and we break.\n“Hey, mate,” Wayne said, settling down on the footstool by Wax’s feet.\n“Wanna hear how I’m a rusting genius?”\n“Shoot,” Wax whispered.\nWayne leaned forward, spread his hands before himself dramatically.\n“I’m gonna get everybody drunk.”\nThe crowd continued its chatter. Mostly constables. Some political allies\nof Wax’s. He’d chosen to do business with the more reputable people in the\ncity, so Aradel’s culling of the lords hadn’t hit his house. It was considered\nan enormous political victory.\n“See, I got this plan,” Wayne said, tapping his head. “People in this\ntown, they got issues. The folks what work in the factories think havin’\nmore time to themselves is gonna fix their woes, but they gotta do\nsomething with that time. I’ve got an idea. It’ll fix it all.”\n“Harmony, Wayne,” Wax said. “You’re not going to poison the city, are\nyou?”\n“Nah,” Wayne said. “Not their bodies, at least.” He grinned. “You\nwatch. This will work. It’s gonna be amazing.” He rose, and stumbled,\nalmost falling. He looked at his leg in surprise, as if he’d forgotten about the\nwound. Then he shook his head, grabbing his crutch and getting to his feet.\nOnce standing he hesitated, then leaned down. “It’ll pass, mate,” he\nsaid. “My pa once said to me, ‘Son, keep a stiff upper lip.’ So if things get\nbad, you bash your face against a wall till your lip bleeds, and you’ll feel\nbetter. Works for me. Least I think it does. Can’t right remember, on\naccount of too many head wounds.”\nHe grinned. Wax kept staring into the flames. Wayne’s face fell.\n“She’d have wanted you to stop her, you know,” Wayne said softly. “If\nshe’d been able to talk to you, been able to think straight, she’d have\ndemanded you kill her. Just like I’d have wanted it. Just like you’d want the\nsame, if you’d lost your copper. You did what you hadda do, mate. And you\ndid it well.”\nHe made a fist at Wax and nodded, then hobbled off, approaching a\nshort young woman with long golden hair. A teenage girl? Wax didn’t\nrecognize her."

Wax didn’t\nrecognize her.\n“I know you, don’t I?” Wayne said. “Daughter of Remmingtel Tarcsel?\nThe guy what invented the incandescent lightbulb?”\nThe girl’s jaw dropped. “You know him?” She seized Wayne by the\narms. “You know about my father?”\n“Sure do!” Wayne said. “He was robbed, I gotta say. Genius. Word is,\nyou’re just as smart. That device you whipped up for making speeches sure\nis nice.”\nShe regarded Wayne, then leaned in. “That’s only the start. They’ve\nbrought it into their houses. Don’t you see? It’s all around.”\n“What?” Wayne said.\n“Electricity,” the girl said. “And I’m going to be the first to use it.”\n“Huh,” Wayne said. “Need some money?”\n“Do I…” She towed Wayne away through the party, aglow, speaking so\nquickly Wax couldn’t pick out the words.\nHe didn’t care to. He just stared at the fire.\nThe guests were polite enough not to imply that he was ruining the party\nby his indifference. Clotide passed by, swapping his cold cup of tea out for\na warm one. For all Wax cared, this comfortable chair could have been a\nhard bench. He didn’t feel it, or the warmth of the fire, or the joy of the\nvictory.\nHow could you hear a bee buzzing in the middle of a thunderstorm?\nThe guests eventually found excuses to leave, their sedate revels\naccomplished. Some bade farewell to him. Others did not. About halfway\nthrough the protracted death of the party, Marasi settled down on his\nfootstool. She wore her constable’s uniform. Odd thing to do at a party,\nthough as he thought about it, the men in the constabulary did it all the time.\nMarasi took his tea and sipped it, then placed something else onto the\ntable where the cup had been. Wax’s eyes flicked toward it. A small spike,\nlong as a finger, made of some silvery metal with dark red spots, like rusted\nbits.\n“That’s one of the spikes she was using, Waxillium,” Marasi said softly.\n“MeLaan wanted me to show it to you.”\nWax closed his eyes. They thought he wanted to see something like\nthat?\n“Waxillium,” Marasi said. “We can’t identify the metal. It’s nothing\nwe’ve ever seen before. It certainly wasn’t one of the spikes she started\nwith. That means she removed both, and stuck one like this in instead.\nWhere did she get them? Who gave them to her?”\n“I don’t care,” he whispered, opening his eyes.\nMarasi grew quiet. “Wax…”\n“He sent her to me, Marasi. He sent a kandra to seduce me.”\n“No,” Marasi said, firm. “He sent a bodyguard to watch over you in the\nRoughs. I spoke to TenSoon. The seduction was her idea. And yours,\npresumably.”\n“Harmony knew,” Wax said hoarsely. “He saw what would happen.”\n“Maybe He didn’t.”"

What good is a God like Him, Marasi?\nTell me that.”\nMarasi fidgeted, then she sighed and took the strange spike back. She\ndropped something else onto the table as she rose. A small earring, just a\nstud with the back bent over. “They sent this for you.”\nWax didn’t look at it. He left that earring right where it was, as Marasi\nmade her farewells and stepped out of the party. Others came to him,\noffered bland encouragement, of the type you might write on a card.\nHe nodded, but didn’t listen.\n* * *\nMarasi stopped by the precinct offices on her way home from the party at\nLadrian Mansion, intent on retrieving her copy of the Lord Mistborn’s\nHemalurgy book, which she’d locked in her drawer. The offices were dark\nand quiet—a direct contrast to the chaos of a few nights back. Though some\nconstables were out on patrol, most had been given time off. Only those\nwith jail watch would be on duty.\nSo it surprised her when she found lights on at the back of the main\nchamber. She walked up and leaned against the doorframe, looking in at\nAradel, who had a stack of papers out and was working on them by\ncandlelight.\n“I find it hard to believe,” Marasi noted, “that there’s nothing better for\nthe governor to do on his first day in office than equipment-depreciation\nreports. Not that I mind. You’ve been ignoring those for … how long?”\nAradel’s expression soured. “I’m not governor,” he said. “Not really.”\n“The title ‘Interim Governor’ has the word ‘Governor’ in it, sir.”\n“They’ll vote someone else into office next month at the proper\nhearing.”\n“Frankly, sir, I doubt that.”\nHe slapped one page down on the stack, signed and sealed, then sat\nthere staring at it. Finally he ran a hand through his hair. “Oh, Preservation.\nWhat have I done? And why the hell didn’t any of you stop me?”\nMarasi smiled. “You didn’t exactly give us a chance, sir.”\n“I’ll run away,” he said. “I’ll refuse the appointment. I’ll…” He looked\nup at her, and then sighed. “I can’t be happy in this position, Colms.”\n“The ones who are happy in the role, sir, seem to have had their chance.\nI’m excited to see where it goes from here. You just changed the world.”\n“Didn’t mean to.”\n“Doesn’t matter,” Marasi said, glancing to the side as someone else\nmoved through the darkened chamber, approaching. Another constable\ncoming in to catch up on work? “Oh no.”\nGovernor Innate stepped up to the door, holding a belt. “Either of you\nknow how to tie one of these?” the former governor said in MeLaan’s\nvoice.\n“You don’t tie a belt, kandra,” Aradel said. “You buckle it.”\n“No, no,” MeLaan said, pulling it tight. “I mean, in making a noose."

Hung there for a good ten minutes, and I’m\npretty sure it wouldn’t have killed even the most frail mortal. I’ve got it\nwrong somehow.”\nShe looked up at the two of them, then frowned at their appalled\nexpressions. “What?”\n“Hang yourself?” Marasi sputtered, finally finding her voice. “You’re\nour linchpin witness!”\n“You really think,” MeLaan said dryly, “that Harmony would let me sit\nat trial and testify falsely against people I don’t even know? It would make\na mockery of justice, kids.”\n“No,” Marasi said. “We have the letters. We know the truth.”\n“Do you?” MeLaan asked, pulling the belt tight again. “You know for\ncertain Paalm didn’t forge those letters, or that Innate himself didn’t do it\nbefore she took him? You know that those lords and ladies went through\nwith the plans, rather than backing out? You know they weren’t just talking\nabout possibilities?”\n“We’ve got good cases, holy immortal,” Aradel said. “Lieutenant Colms\nhas done her research. We’re pretty sure this is all correct.”\n“Then convince the judge and jury,” MeLaan said with a shrug. “We\ndon’t do things like this. People have to be able to trust the law; I’m a lot of\nthings, but I’m not going to be the one who sets the precedent that the\nkandra can lie in order to get someone convicted, even if you’re ‘pretty\nsure’ you’ve got the right evidence.”\nMarasi folded her arms, grinding her teeth. Aradel glanced at her,\nquestioning.\n“Without her, they’ll wiggle out of it,” Marasi said. “We won’t be able\nto keep them in jail. They’ll be loose upon the city again.” She sighed.\n“But … Blast. She’s probably right, sir. I’d have hit on it if I’d thought\nabout it long enough. We can’t falsify evidence, however right our cause.”\nHe nodded. “We weren’t going to keep them in prison anyway, Colms.\nThey have too much power, even now. They’d find a way to escape\nconviction, pinning the charges on subordinates.” He sat back in his chair.\n“They’ll have the governor’s seat again, unless someone does something\nabout it. Damn it. I really have to do this, don’t I?”\n“Sorry, sir,” Marasi said.\n“Well, at least I can get my desk clear of paperwork first,” he said,\nleaning forward in determination. “Suggestions for my replacement as\nconstable-general?”\n“Reddi,” Marasi said.\n“He hates you.”\n“Doesn’t make him a bad conner, sir,” Marasi said. “So long as\nsomeone keeps an eye on him, as you put it. I can do that. I think he’ll rise\nto the challenge.”\nAradel nodded, then held up a hand to MeLaan. She tossed him the belt,\nand he tied it in a loop."

You know how to make someone look like they\ndied of strangling?”\n“Yeah,” MeLaan said. “Unfortunately.”\n“I’ll come cut you down in fifteen minutes,” Aradel said. “You’ll need\nto fool the coroner.”\n“No problem,” MeLaan said. “I can breathe through a tracheal system\ninstead of lungs. Arrange to have the body cremated, give me a window,\nand I’ll slip out and leave the bones, which you can burn. Nice and neat.”\n“Fine,” Aradel said, looking sick.\nMeLaan bade him farewell, wandering back toward the cells. Marasi\njoined her after giving Aradel a salute he didn’t see.\n“How did you get out, anyway?” Marasi asked, catching up to MeLaan.\n“Stuck my finger in the lock,” MeLaan said, “and melted my skin,\nshoving a bit in. It’s amazing what you can do when you aren’t constrained\nto normal body shapes.”\nThey walked together to the entrance of the jail part of the building.\nMarasi wasn’t going to ask how MeLaan had avoided the guards. Hopefully\nthe two hadn’t been hurt.\n“Harmony knows, right?” Marasi asked as MeLaan lingered at the door.\n“If these people are guilty or not?”\n“He does.”\n“So you could simply ask Him if it’s just to imprison them. If He says\nyes, we could go through with it. I’d accept God’s word on the matter to\nsatisfy my conscience.”\n“Still breaks our rules,” MeLaan said. “And Harmony probably\nwouldn’t talk.”\n“Why not?” Marasi said. “You realize what all this has done to\nWaxillium, right?”\n“He’ll weather it.”\n“He shouldn’t have to.”\n“And what would you have Harmony do, woman? Give us all the\nanswers? Lead us by the noses, like Paalm swore that He did? Turn us all\ninto pieces on a board for His amusement?”\nMarasi stepped back. She’d never heard such a tone from MeLaan.\n“Or maybe you want it the other way?” MeLaan snapped. “Leave us\nalone completely? Not intervene at all?”\n“No, I—”\n“Can you imagine what it must be like? Knowing that any action you\ntake is going to help some, but hurt others? Save a man’s life now, let him\nspread a disease that kills a child later in his life. Harmony does the best He\ncan—the best possible, by the very definition. Yes, He hurt Wax. He hurt\nhim badly. But He put the pain where He knew it could be borne.”\nMarasi blushed, then—annoyed at herself—dug in her purse and\nbrought out the strange spike. “And this?”\n“It’s not a metal we know.”\n“That’s what TenSoon said.

Think on that for a while, before you go\naround accusing Harmony—or the kandra—of anything. Now, if you’ll\nexcuse me, I’m going to go try to hang myself properly.”\nShe slipped away, closing the door behind her.\nAnother god, Marasi thought, standing in the darkness. Not Harmony,\nnot Ruin, not Preservation.\nShe looked down at the small spike in her hands, and heard a name from\na year ago, spoken by Miles Hundredlives as he died. The name of a god\nfrom the old days. Marasi had researched the name halfheartedly, far more\ndistracted by her interaction with Ironeyes.\nNow, however, she determined to dig back into the records and find the\nanswers.\nWho, or what, was Trell?\n* * *\nThe room had probably grown silent long before Wax noticed he was alone.\nThe fire was dying. He should do something about that.\nHe didn’t.\nSteris stepped over and set a new log on, then stirred the embers. So he\nhadn’t been alone. She set the poker beside the fireplace, then regarded him.\nHe awaited her words.\nNone came. Instead, she scooted the footstool around until it was beside\nhis chair. She sat down, legs crossed neatly, hands in her lap.\nThe two of them remained there, not saying a word, though she did\neventually rest her hand on top of his. The fire had felt cold to him, the air\nfrozen, but that hand was warm.\nFinally, he turned to the side, rested his head on her shoulder, and wept.\nARS ARCANUM\nMETALS QUICK REFERENCE CHART\nLIST OF METALS\nALUMINUM: A Mistborn who burns aluminum instantly metabolizes all of\nhis or her metals without giving any other effect, wiping all Allomantic\nreserves.

This\ncauses events outside the bubble to move at a glacial pace from the point\nof view of the Slider. Subsumer Ferrings can store nutrition and calories\nin a bendalloy metalmind; they can eat large amounts of food during\nactive storage without feeling full or gaining weight, and then can go\nwithout the need to eat while tapping the metalmind. A separate\nbendalloy metalmind can be used to similarly regulate fluids intake.\nBRASS: Soother Mistings burn brass to Soothe (dampen) the emotions of\nnearby individuals. This can be directed at a single individual or directed\nacross a general area, and the Soother can focus on specific emotions.\nFiresoul Ferrings can store warmth in a brass metalmind, cooling\nthemselves off while actively storing. They can tap the metalmind at a\nlater time to warm themselves.\nBRONZE: Seeker Mistings burn bronze to “hear” pulses given off by other\nAllomancers who are burning metals. Different metals produce different\npulses. Sentry Ferrings can store wakefulness in a bronze metalmind,\nmaking themselves drowsy while actively storing. They can tap the\nmetalmind at a later time to reduce drowsiness or to heighten their\nawareness.\nCADMIUM: Pulser Mistings burn cadmium to stretch time in a bubble around\nthemselves, making it pass more slowly inside the bubble. This causes\nevents outside the bubble to move at blurring speed from the point of\nview of the Pulser. Gasper Ferrings can store breath inside a cadmium\nmetalmind; during active storage they must hyperventilate in order for\ntheir bodies to get enough air. The breath can be retrieved at a later time,\neliminating or reducing the need to breathe using the lungs while tapping\nthe metalmind. They can also highly oxygenate their blood.\nCHROMIUM: Leecher Mistings who burn chromium while touching another\nAllomancer will wipe that Allomancer’s metal reserves. Spinner Ferrings\ncan store fortune in a chromium metalmind, making themselves unlucky\nduring active storage, and can tap it at a later time to increase their luck.\nCOPPER: Coppercloud Mistings (a.k.a. Smokers) burn copper to create an\ninvisible cloud around themselves, which hides nearby Allomancers from\nbeing detected by a Seeker and which shields the Smoker from the effects\nof emotional Allomancy. Archivist Ferrings can store memories in a\ncopper metalmind (coppermind); the memory is gone from their head\nwhile in storage, and can be retrieved with perfect recall at a later time.\nDURALUMIN: A Mistborn who burns duralumin instantly burns away any\nother metals being burned at the time, releasing an enormous burst of\nthose metals’ power. Mistings who can burn Duralumin are called\nDuralumin Gnats due to the ineffectiveness of this ability by itself.\nConnecter Ferrings can store spiritual connection in a duralumin\nmetalmind, reducing other people’s awareness and friendship with them\nduring active storage, and can tap it at a later time in order to speedily\nform trust relationships with others."

This is a power that very few\nknow anything about; indeed, I’m certain the people of Terris don’t truly\nknow what they are doing when they use these powers.\nPEWTER: Pewterarm Mistings (a.k.a. Thugs) burn pewter to increase their\nphysical strength, speed, and durability, also enhancing their bodies’\nability to heal. Brute Ferrings can store physical strength in a pewter\nmetalmind, reducing their strength while actively storing, and can tap it\nat a later time to increase their strength.\nSTEEL: Coinshot Mistings who burn steel can Push on nearby sources of\nmetal. Pushes must be directly away from the Coinshot’s center of\ngravity. Steelrunner Ferrings can store physical speed in a steel\nmetalmind, slowing them while actively storing, and can tap it at a later\ntime to increase their speed.\nTIN: Tineye Mistings who burn tin increases the sensitivity of their five\nsenses. All are increased at the same time. Windwhisperer Ferrings can\nstore the sensitivity of one of the five senses into a tin metalmind; a\ndifferent tin metalmind must be used for each sense. While storing, their\nsensitivity in that sense is reduced, and when the metalmind is tapped\nthat sense is enhanced.\nZINC: Rioter Mistings burn zinc to Riot (enflame) the emotions of nearby\nindividuals. This can be directed at a single individual or directed across\na general area, and the Rioter can focus on specific emotions.

        "text": "to think and reason while actively storing, and can tap it at a later time to\nthink and reason more quickly.\nON THE THREE METALLIC ARTS\nOn Scadrial, there are three prime manifestations of Investiture. Locally,\nthese are spoken of as the “Metallic Arts,” though there are other names for\nthem.\nAllomancy is the most common of the three. It is end-positive,\naccording to my terminology—meaning that the practitioner draws in\npower from an external source. The body then filters it into various forms.\n(The actual outlet of the power is not chosen by the practitioner, but instead\nis hardwritten into their Spiritweb.) The key to drawing this power comes in\nthe form of various types of metals, with specific compositions being\nrequired. Though the metal is consumed in the process, the power itself\ndoesn’t actually come from the metal. The metal is a catalyst, you might\nsay, that begins an Investiture and keeps it running.\nIn truth, this isn’t much different from the form-based Investitures one\nfinds on Sel, where specific shape is the key—here, however, the\ninteractions are more limited. Still, one cannot deny the raw power of\nAllomancy. It is instinctive and intuitive for the practitioner, as opposed to\nrequiring a great deal of study and exactness, as one finds in the form-based\nInvestitures of Sel.\nAllomancy is brutal, raw, and powerful. There are sixteen base metals\nthat work, though two others—named the “God Metals” locally—can be\nused in alloy to craft an entirely different set of sixteen each. As these God\nMetals are no longer commonly available, however, the other metals are not\nin wide use.\nFeruchemy is still widely known and used at this point on Scadrial.\nIndeed, you might say that it is more present today than it has been in many\neras past, when it was confined to distant Terris or hidden from sight by the\nKeepers.\nFeruchemy is an end-neutral art, meaning that power is neither gained\nnor lost. The art also requires metal as a focus, but instead of being\nconsumed, the metal acts as a medium by which abilities within the\npractitioner are shuttled through time. Invest that metal on one day,\nwithdraw the power on another day. It is a well-rounded art, with some\nfeelers in the Physical, some in the Cognitive, and even some in the\nSpiritual. The last powers are under heavy experimentation by the Terris\ncommunity, and aren’t spoken of to outsiders.\nIt should be noted that the inbreeding of the Feruchemists with the\ngeneral population has diluted the power in some ways. It is now common\nfor people to be born with access to only one of the sixteen Feruchemical\nabilities. It is hypothesized that if one could make metalminds out of alloys\nwith the God Metals, other abilities could be discovered.\nHemalurgy is widely unknown in the modern world of Scadrial. Its\nsecrets were kept close by those who survived their world’s rebirth, and the\nonly known practitioners of it now are the kandra, who (for the most part)\nserve Harmony.\nHemalurgy is an end-negative art.

        "text": "serve Harmony.\nHemalurgy is an end-negative art. Some power is lost in the practice of\nit. Though many through history have maligned it as an “evil” art, none of\nthe Investitures are actually evil. At its core, Hemalurgy deals with\nremoving abilities—or attributes—from one person and bestowing them on\nanother. It is primarily concerned with things of the Spiritual Realm, and is\nof the greatest interest to me. If one of these three arts is of great interest to\nthe cosmere, it is this one. I think there are great possibilities for its use.\nCOMBINATIONS\nIt is possible on Scadrial to be born with ability to access both Allomancy\nand Feruchemy. This has been of specific interest to me lately, as the mixing\nof different types of Investiture has curious effects. One needs look only at\nwhat has happened on Roshar to find this manifested—two powers,\ncombined, often have an almost chemical reaction. Instead of getting out\nexactly what you put in, you get something new.\nOn Scadrial, someone with one Allomantic power and one Feruchemical\npower is called “Twinborn.” The effects here are more subtle than they are\nwhen mixing Surges on Roshar, but I am convinced that each unique\ncombination also creates something distinctive. Not just two powers, you\ncould say, but two powers … and an effect. This demands further study.\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nBRANDON SANDERSON grew up in Lincoln, Nebraska.
