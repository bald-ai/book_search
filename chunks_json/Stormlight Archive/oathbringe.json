It’s been a long road, creating this book. I thank\nyou for your patience. Stormlight books are a huge undertaking—which\nyou might be able to infer from the large list of people below.\nIf you haven’t had the chance to read Edgedancer—a separate\nStormlight novella taking place between books two and three—I’d\nrecommend it to you now. Find it sold on its own, or in the story collection\nArcanum Unbounded, which has novellas and novelettes from all across the\nCosmere. (The universe in which this series, Mistborn, Elantris,\nWarbreaker, and others take place.)\nThat said, as always, every series is written so it can be read and enjoyed\non its own, without knowledge of these other series or books. If you’re\nintrigued, you can find a longer explanation I’ve written at\nbrandonsanderson.com/cosmere.\nNow, on to the parade of names! As I often say, though my name goes on\nthe cover, there are tons of people involved in bringing you these books.\nThey deserve my most hearty of thanks, and yours as well, for their tireless\nwork across the three years it took to write this novel.\nMy main agent for these books (and everything else) is the wonderful\nJoshua Bilmes, of JABberwocky. Others at the agency who worked on them\ninclude Brady McReynolds, Krystyna Lopez, and Rebecca Eskildsen.\nSpecial thanks also go to John Berlyne, my UK agent, of Zeno—along with\nall of the sub-agents who work with us around the world.\nMy editor at Tor on this project was the ever-brilliant Moshe Feder.\nSpecial thanks to Tom Doherty, who has believed in the Stormlight project\nfor years, and Devi Pillai, who provided essential publishing and editorial\naid during the course of the novel’s creation.\nOthers at Tor who provided help include Robert Davis, Melissa Singer,\nRachel Bass, and Patty Garcia.

Irene Gallo was our Art Director, Peter Lutjen the cover\ndesigner, Greg Collins the interior designer, and Carly Sommerstein our\nproofreader.\nAt Gollancz/Orion (my UK publisher) thanks goes to Gillian Redfearn,\nStevie Finegan, and Charlotte Clay.\nOur copyeditor on this book was Terry McGarry, who has done excellent\nwork on many of my novels. The ebook was prepared by Westchester\nPublishing Services, along with Victoria Wallis and Christopher Gonzalez at\nMacmillan.\nMany people at my own company worked long hours to produce this\nbook. A Stormlight novel is “crunch time” for us here at Dragonsteel, and\nso make sure to give the team a thumbs-up (or, in Peter’s case, a block of\ncheese) next time you meet them. Our manager and Chief Operations\nOfficer is my lovely wife, Emily Sanderson. Vice President and Editorial\nDirector is the Insistent Peter Ahlstrom. Art Director is Isaac Stʒwart.\nOur shipping manager (and the one who ships you all our signed books\nand T-shirts via the brandonsanderson.com store) is Kara Stewart.\nContinuity editor—and holy keeper of our internal continuity wiki—is\nKaren Ahlstrom. Adam Horne is my executive assistant and\npublicity/marketing director. Emily’s assistant is Kathleen Dorsey\nSanderson and our executive minion is Emily “Mem” Grange.\nThe audiobook was read by my personal favorite audiobook narrators,\nMichael Kramer and Kate Reading. Thanks again, guys, for making time in\nyour schedule for this!\nOathbringer continues the tradition of filling The Stormlight Archive\nwith beautiful art. We again have a fantastic cover illustration by Michael\nWhelan, whose attention to detail has given us an incredibly accurate\nrendition of Jasnah Kholin. I love that she gets a place to shine on the cover\nof this book, and I continue to feel honored and grateful that Michael takes\ntime away from his gallery work to paint the world of Roshar.\nIt takes a variety of artists to recreate the styles found in the ephemera of\nanother world, so this time around we’ve worked with even more artists\nthan before. Dan dos Santos and Howard Lyon are responsible for the\npaintings of the Heralds on the front and back endpapers. I wanted these to\nhave a style evoking classical paintings of the Renaissance and the later\nRomantic era, and both Dan and Howard exceeded expectations. These\npieces are not only great art for a book, they are great art period, deserving\nof a place in any gallery.\nI should note that Dan and Howard also contributed their talents to the\ninterior art, for which I’m also grateful. Dan’s fashion pieces are good\nenough to be cover art, and Howard’s linework for some of the new chapter\nicons is something I hope to see more of in future volumes.\nBen McSweeney joins us again, providing nine pieces of art from\nShallan’s sketchbook. Between a cross-continent move, a demanding day\njob, and the needs of a growing family, Ben has been ever consistent in\ndelivering top-notch illustrations. He is a great artist and a quality human\nbeing."

Without the\nefforts of these many people, you’d be holding a far, far inferior book.\nAs always, some final thanks go to my family: Emily Sanderson, Joel\nSanderson, Dallin Sanderson, and Oliver Sanderson. They put up with a\nhusband/father who is often off in another world, thinking about highstorms\nand Knights Radiant.\nFinally, thanks to you all, for your support of these books! They don’t\nalways come out as quickly as I’d like, but that is in part because I want\nthem to be as perfect as they can get. You hold in your hands a volume I’ve\nbeen preparing and outlining for almost two decades. May you enjoy your\ntime in Roshar.\nJourney before destination.\nPrologue: To Weep\nSIX YEARS AGO\nEshonai had always told her sister that she was certain something wonderful\nlay over the next hill. Then one day, she’d crested a hill and found humans.\nShe’d always imagined humans—as sung of in the songs—as dark,\nformless monsters. Instead they were wonderful, bizarre creatures. They\nspoke with no discernible rhythm. They wore clothing more vibrant than\ncarapace, but couldn’t grow their own armor. They were so terrified of the\nstorms that even when traveling they hid inside vehicles.\nMost remarkably, they had only one form.\nShe first assumed the humans must have forgotten their forms, much as\nthe listeners once had. That built an instant kinship between them.\nNow, over a year later, Eshonai hummed to the Rhythm of Awe as she\nhelped unload drums from the cart. They’d traveled a great distance to see\nthe human homeland, and each step had overwhelmed her further. That\nexperience culminated here, in this incredible city of Kholinar and its\nmagnificent palace.\nThis cavernous unloading dock on the western side of the palace was so\nlarge, two hundred listeners had packed in here after their first arrival, and\nstill hadn’t filled the place. Indeed, most of the listeners couldn’t attend the\nfeast upstairs—where the treaty between their two peoples was being\nwitnessed—but the Alethi had seen to their refreshment anyway, providing\nmountains of food and drink for the group down here.\nShe stepped out of the wagon, looking around the loading dock,\nhumming to Excitement. When she’d told Venli she was determined to map\nthe world, she’d imagined a place of natural discovery. Canyons and hills,\nforests and laits overgrown with life. Yet all along, this had been out here.\nWaiting just beyond their reach.\nAlong with more listeners.\nWhen Eshonai had first met the humans, she’d seen the little listeners\nthey had with them. A hapless tribe who were trapped in dullform. Eshonai\nhad assumed the humans were taking care of the poor souls without songs.\nOh, how innocent those first meetings had been.\nThose captive listeners had not been merely some small tribe, but instead\nrepresentative of an enormous population. And the humans had not been\ncaring for them.\nThe humans owned them."

        "text": "Those captive listeners had not been merely some small tribe, but instead\nrepresentative of an enormous population. And the humans had not been\ncaring for them.\nThe humans owned them.\nA group of these parshmen, as they were called, clustered around the\noutside of Eshonai’s ring of workers.\n“They keep trying to help,” Gitgeth said to Curiosity. He shook his head,\nhis beard sparkling with ruby gemstones that matched the prominent red\ncolors of his skin. “The little rhythmless ones want to be near us. They\nsense that something is wrong with their minds, I tell you.”\nEshonai handed him a drum from the back of the cart, then hummed to\nCuriosity herself. She hopped down and approached the group of parshmen.\n“You aren’t needed,” she said to Peace, spreading her hands. “We would\nprefer to handle our own drums.”\nThe ones without songs looked at her with dull eyes.\n“Go,” she said to Pleading, waving toward the nearby festivities, where\nlisteners and human servants laughed together, despite the language barrier.\nHumans clapped along to listeners singing the old songs. “Enjoy\nyourselves.”\nA few looked toward the singing and cocked their heads, but they didn’t\nmove.\n“It won’t work,” Brianlia said to Skepticism, resting her arms across a\ndrum nearby. “They simply can’t imagine what it is to live. They’re pieces\nof property, to be bought and sold.”\nWhat to make of this idea? Slaves? Klade, one of the Five, had gone to\nthe slavers in Kholinar and purchased a person to see if it truly was\npossible. He hadn’t even bought a parshman; there had been Alethi for sale.\nApparently the parshmen were expensive, and considered high-quality\nslaves. The listeners had been told this, as if it were supposed to make them\nproud.\nShe hummed to Curiosity and nodded to the side, looking toward the\nothers. Gitgeth smiled and hummed to Peace, waving for her to go.\nEveryone was used to Eshonai wandering off in the middle of jobs. It\nwasn’t that she was unreliable.… Well, perhaps she was, but at least she\nwas consistent.\nRegardless, she’d be wanted at the king’s celebration soon anyway; she\nwas one of the best among the listeners at the dull human tongue, which\nshe’d taken to naturally. It was an advantage that had earned her a place on\nthis expedition, but it was also a problem. Speaking the human tongue made\nher important, and people who grew too important couldn’t be allowed to\ngo off chasing the horizon.\nShe left the unloading bay and walked up the steps into the palace\nproper, trying to take in the ornamentation, the artistry, the sheer\noverwhelming wonder of the building. Beautiful and terrible. People who\nwere bought and sold maintained this place, but was that what freed the\nhumans to create great works like the carvings on the pillars she passed, or\nthe inlaid marble patterns on the floor?\nShe passed soldiers wearing their artificial carapace. Eshonai didn’t have\narmor of her own at the moment; she wore workform instead of warform, as\nshe liked its flexibility.\nHumans didn’t have a choice. They hadn’t lost their forms as she’d first"

They hadn’t lost their forms as she’d first\nassumed; they only had one. Forever in mateform, workform, and warform\nall at once. And they wore their emotions on their faces far more than\nlisteners. Oh, Eshonai’s people would smile, laugh, cry. But not like these\nAlethi.\nThe lower level of the palace was marked by broad hallways and\ngalleries, lit by carefully cut gemstones that made light sparkle. Chandeliers\nhung above her, broken suns spraying light everywhere. Perhaps the plain\nappearance of the human bodies—with their bland skin that was various\nshades of tan—was another reason they sought to ornament everything,\nfrom their clothing to these pillars.\nCould we do this? she thought, humming to Appreciation. If we knew the\nright form for creating art?\nThe upper floors of the palace were more like tunnels. Narrow stone\ncorridors, rooms like bunkers dug into a mountainside. She made her way\ntoward the feast hall to check if she was needed, but stopped here and there\nto glance into rooms. She’d been told she could wander as she pleased, that\nthe palace was open to her save for areas with guards at the doors.\nShe passed a room with paintings on all the walls, then one with a bed\nand furniture. Another door revealed an indoor privy with running water, a\nmarvel that she still didn’t understand.\nShe poked through a dozen rooms. As long as she reached the king’s\ncelebration in time for the music, Klade and the others of the Five wouldn’t\ncomplain. They were as familiar with her ways as everyone else. She was\nalways wandering off, poking into things, peeking into doors …\nAnd finding the king?\nEshonai froze, the door cracked open, allowing her to see into a lush\nroom with a thick red rug and bookshelves lining the walls. So much\ninformation just lying around, casually ignored. More surprisingly, King\nGavilar himself stood pointing at something on a table, surrounded by five\nothers: two officers, two women in long dresses, and one old man in robes.\nWhy wasn’t Gavilar at the feast? Why weren’t there guards at the door?\nEshonai attuned Anxiety and pulled back, but not before one of the women\nprodded Gavilar and pointed toward Eshonai. Anxiety pounding in her\nhead, she pulled the door closed.\nA moment later a tall man in uniform stepped out. “The king would like\nto see you, Parshendi.”\nShe feigned confusion. “Sir? Words?”\n“Don’t be coy,” the soldier said. “You’re one of the interpreters. Come\nin. You aren’t in trouble.”\nAnxiety shaking her, she let him lead her into the den.\n“Thank you, Meridas,” Gavilar said. “Leave us for a moment, all of\nyou.”\nThey filed out, leaving Eshonai at the door attuning Consolation and\nhumming it loudly—even though the humans wouldn’t understand what it\nmeant.\n“Eshonai,” the king said. “I have something to show you.”\nHe knew her name? She stepped farther into the small, warm room,"

She didn’t understand this man. It was\nmore than his alien, dead way of speaking. More than the fact that she\ncouldn’t anticipate what emotions might be swirling in there, as warform\nand mateform contested within him.\nMore than any human, this man baffled her. Why had he offered them\nsuch a favorable treaty? At first it had seemed an accommodation between\ntribes. That was before she’d come here, seen this city and the Alethi\narmies. Her people had once possessed cities of their own, and armies to\nenvy. They knew that from the songs.\nThat had been long ago. They were a fragment of a lost people. Traitors\nwho had abandoned their gods to be free. This man could have crushed the\nlisteners. They’d once assumed that their Shards—weapons they had so far\nkept hidden from the humans—would be enough to protect them. But she’d\nnow seen over a dozen Shardblades and suits of Shardplate among the\nAlethi.\nWhy did he smile at her like that? What was he hiding, by not singing to\nthe rhythms to calm her?\n“Sit, Eshonai,” the king said. “Oh, don’t be frightened, little scout. I’ve\nbeen wanting to speak to you. Your mastery of our language is unique!”\nShe settled on a chair while Gavilar reached down and removed\nsomething from a small satchel. It glowed with red Stormlight, a\nconstruction of gemstones and metal, crafted in a beautiful design.\n“Do you know what this is?” he asked, gently pushing it toward her.\n“No, Your Majesty.”\n“It’s what we call a fabrial, a device powered by Stormlight. This one\nmakes warmth. Just a smidge, unfortunately, but my wife is confident her\nscholars can create one that will heat a room. Wouldn’t that be wonderful?\nNo more smoky fires in hearths.”\nIt seemed lifeless to Eshonai, but she didn’t say so. She hummed to\nPraise so he’d feel happy telling her of this, and handed it back.\n“Look closely,” King Gavilar said. “Look deep into it. Can you see\nwhat’s moving inside? It’s a spren. That is how the device works.”\nCaptive like in a gemheart, she thought, attuning Awe. They’ve built\ndevices that mimic how we apply the forms? The humans did so much with\ntheir limitations!\n“The chasmfiends aren’t your gods, are they,” he said.\n“What?” she asked, attuning Skepticism. “Why ask that?” What a\nstrange turn in the conversation.\n“Oh, it’s merely something I’ve been thinking about.” He took the\nfabrial back. “My officers feel so superior, as they think they have you\nfigured out. They think you’re savages, but they are so wrong. You’re not\nsavages. You’re an enclave of memories. A window into the past.”\nHe leaned forward, the light from the ruby leaking between his fingers.\n“I need you to deliver a message to your leaders. The Five? You’re close to"

I need their help to achieve something.”\nShe hummed to Anxiety.\n“Now, now,” he said. “I’m going to help you, Eshonai. Did you know,\nI’ve discovered how to bring your gods back?”\nNo. She hummed to the Rhythm of the Terrors. No …\n“My ancestors,” he said, holding up the fabrial, “first learned how to\nhold a spren inside a gemstone. And with a very special gemstone, you can\nhold even a god.”\n“Your Majesty,” she said, daring to take his hand in hers. He couldn’t\nfeel the rhythms. He didn’t know. “Please. We no longer worship those\ngods. We left them, abandoned them.”\n“Ah, but this is for your good, and for ours.” He stood up. “We live\nwithout honor, for your gods once brought ours. Without them, we have no\npower. This world is trapped, Eshonai! Stuck in a dull, lifeless state of\ntransition.” He looked toward the ceiling. “Unite them. I need a threat. Only\ndanger will unite them.”\n“What…” she said to Anxiety. “What are you saying?”\n“Our enslaved parshmen were once like you. Then we somehow robbed\nthem of their ability to undergo the transformation. We did it by capturing a\nspren. An ancient, crucial spren.” He looked at her, green eyes alight. “I’ve\nseen how that can be reversed. A new storm that will bring the Heralds out\nof hiding. A new war.”\n“Insanity.” She rose to her feet. “Our gods tried to destroy you.”\n“The old Words must be spoken again.”\n“You can’t…” She trailed off, noticing for the first time that a map\ncovered the table nearby. Expansive, it showed a land bounded by oceans—\nand the artistry of it put her own attempts to shame.\nShe rose and stepped to the table, gaping, the Rhythm of Awe playing in\nher mind. This is gorgeous. Even the grand chandeliers and carved walls\nwere nothing by comparison. This was knowledge and beauty, fused into\none.\n“I thought you’d be pleased to hear that we are allies in seeking the\nreturn of your gods,” Gavilar said. She could almost hear the Rhythm of\nReprimand in his dead words. “You claim to fear them, but why fear that\nwhich made you live? My people need to be united, and I need an empire\nthat won’t simply turn to infighting once I am gone.”\n“So you seek for war?”\n“I seek for an end to something that we never finished. My people were\nRadiant once, and your people—the parshmen—were vibrant. Who is\nserved by this drab world where my people fight each other in endless\nsquabbles, without light to guide them, and your people are as good as\ncorpses?”\nShe looked back at the map. “Where … where is the Shattered Plains?\nThis portion here?”\n“That is all of Natanatan you gesture toward, Eshonai! This is the\nShattered Plains.” He pointed at a spot not much bigger than his thumbnail,"

        "text": "This portion here?”\n“That is all of Natanatan you gesture toward, Eshonai! This is the\nShattered Plains.” He pointed at a spot not much bigger than his thumbnail,\nwhen the entire map was as large as the table.\nIt gave her a sudden dizzying perspective. This was the world? She’d\nassumed that in traveling to Kholinar, they’d crossed almost as far as the\nland could go. Why hadn’t they shown her this before!\nHer legs weakened, and she attuned Mourning. She dropped back into\nher seat, unable to stand.\nSo vast.\nGavilar removed something from his pocket. A sphere? It was dark, yet\nsomehow still glowed. As if it had … an aura of blackness, a phantom light\nthat was not light. Faintly violet. It seemed to suck in the light around it.\nHe set it on the table before her. “Take that to the Five and explain what I\ntold you. Tell them to remember what your people once were. Wake up,\nEshonai.”\nHe patted her on the shoulder, then left the room. She stared at that\nterrible light, and—from the songs—knew it for what it was. The forms of\npower had been associated with a dark light, a light from the king of gods.\nShe plucked the sphere off the table and went running.\n* * *\nWhen the drums were set up, Eshonai insisted on joining the drummers. An\noutlet for her anxiety. She beat to the rhythm in her head, banging as hard as\nshe could, trying with each beat to banish the things the king had said.\nAnd the things she’d just done.\nThe Five sat at the high table, the remnants of their final course uneaten.\nHe intends to bring back our gods, she’d told the Five.\nClose your eyes. Focus on the rhythms.\nHe can do it. He knows so much.\nFurious beats pulsing through her soul.\nWe have to do something.\nKlade’s slave was an assassin. Klade claimed that a voice—speaking to\nthe rhythms—had led him to the man, who had confessed his skills when\npressed. Venli had apparently been with Klade, though Eshonai hadn’t seen\nher sister since earlier in the day.\nAfter a frantic debate, the Five had agreed this was a sign of what they\nwere to do. Long ago, the listeners had summoned the courage to adopt\ndullform in order to escape their gods. They’d sought freedom at any cost.\nToday, the cost of maintaining that freedom would be high.\nShe played the drums. She felt the rhythms. She wept softly, and didn’t\nlook as the strange assassin—wearing flowing white clothing provided by\nKlade—left the room. She’d voted with the others for this course of action.\nFeel the peace of the music. As her mother always said. Seek the\nrhythms. Seek the songs.\nShe resisted as the others pulled her away. She wept to leave the music\nbehind. Wept for her people, who might be destroyed for tonight’s action.\nWept for the world, which might never know what the listeners had done\nfor it.\nWept for the king, whom she had consigned to death.\nThe drums cut off around her, and dying music echoed through the halls."

Broken and Divided\nI’m certain some will feel threatened by this record. Some few may feel\nliberated. Most will simply feel that it should not exist.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nDalinar Kholin appeared in the vision standing beside the memory of a dead\ngod.\nIt had been six days since his forces had arrived at Urithiru, legendary\nholy tower city of the Knights Radiant. They had escaped the arrival of a\nnew devastating storm, seeking refuge through an ancient portal. They were\nsettling into their new home hidden in the mountains.\nAnd yet, Dalinar felt as if he knew nothing. He didn’t understand the\nforce he fought, let alone how to defeat it. He barely understood the storm,\nand what it meant in returning the Voidbringers, ancient enemies of men.\nSo he came here, into his visions. Seeking to pull secrets from the god—\nnamed Honor, or the Almighty—who had left them. This particular vision\nwas the first that Dalinar had ever experienced. It began with him standing\nnext to an image of the god in human form, both perched atop a cliff\noverlooking Kholinar: Dalinar’s home, seat of the government. In the\nvision, the city had been destroyed by some unknown force.\nThe Almighty started speaking, but Dalinar ignored him. Dalinar had\nbecome a Knight Radiant by bonding the Stormfather himself—soul of the\nhighstorm, most powerful spren on Roshar—and Dalinar had discovered he\ncould now have these visions replayed for him at will. He’d already heard\nthis monologue three times, and had repeated it word for word to Navani for\ntranscription.\nThis time, Dalinar instead walked to the edge of the cliff and knelt to\nlook out upon the ruins of Kholinar. The air smelled dry here, dusty and\nwarm. He squinted, trying to extract some meaningful detail from the chaos\nof broken buildings. Even the windblades—once magnificent, sleek rock\nformations exposing countless strata and variations—had been shattered.\nThe Almighty continued his speech. These visions were like a diary, a set\nof immersive messages the god had left behind. Dalinar appreciated the\nhelp, but right now he wanted details.\nHe searched the sky and discovered a ripple in the air, like heat rising\nfrom distant stone. A shimmer the size of a building.\n“Stormfather,” he said. “Can you take me down below, into the rubble?”\nYou are not supposed to go there. That is not part of the vision.\n“Ignore what I’m supposed to do, for the moment,” Dalinar said. “Can\nyou do it? Can you transport me to those ruins?”\nThe Stormfather rumbled. He was a strange being, somehow connected\nto the dead god, but not exactly the same thing as the Almighty. At least\ntoday he wasn’t using a voice that rattled Dalinar’s bones.\nIn an eyeblink, Dalinar was transported. He no longer stood atop the\ncliff, but was on the plains down before the ruins of the city.\n“Thank you,” Dalinar said, striding the short remaining distance to the\nruins."

        "text": "cliff, but was on the plains down before the ruins of the city.\n“Thank you,” Dalinar said, striding the short remaining distance to the\nruins.\nOnly six days had passed since their discovery of Urithiru. Six days\nsince the awakening of the Parshendi, who had gained strange powers and\nglowing red eyes. Six days since the arrival of the new storm—the\nEverstorm, a tempest of dark thunderheads and red lightning.\nSome in his armies thought that it was finished, the storm over as one\ncatastrophic event. Dalinar knew otherwise. The Everstorm would return,\nand would soon hit Shinovar in the far west. Following that, it would course\nacross the land.\nNobody believed his warnings. Monarchs in places like Azir and\nThaylenah admitted that a strange storm had appeared in the east, but they\ndidn’t believe it would return.\nThey couldn’t guess how destructive this storm’s return would be. When\nit had first appeared, it had clashed with the highstorm, creating a unique\ncataclysm. Hopefully it would not be as bad on its own—but it would still\nbe a storm blowing the wrong way. And it would awaken the world’s\nparshman servants and make them into Voidbringers.\nWhat do you expect to learn? the Stormfather said as Dalinar reached the\nrubble of the city. This vision was constructed to draw you to the ridge to\nspeak with Honor. The rest is backdrop, a painting.\n“Honor put this rubble here,” Dalinar said, waving toward the broken\nwalls heaped before him. “Backdrop or not, his knowledge of the world and\nour enemy couldn’t help but affect the way he made this vision.”\nDalinar hiked up the rubble of the outer walls. Kholinar had been …\nstorm it, Kholinar was … a grand city, like few in the world. Instead of\nhiding in the shadow of a cliff or inside a sheltered chasm, Kholinar trusted\nin its enormous walls to buffer it from highstorm winds. It defied the winds,\nand did not bow to the storms.\nIn this vision, something had destroyed it anyway. Dalinar crested the\ndetritus and surveyed the area, trying to imagine how it had felt to settle\nhere so many millennia ago. Back when there had been no walls. It had\nbeen a hardy, stubborn lot who had grown this place.\nHe saw scrapes and gouges on the stones of the fallen walls, like those\nmade by a predator in the flesh of its prey. The windblades had been\nsmashed, and from up close he could see claw marks on one of those as\nwell.\n“I’ve seen creatures that could do this,” he said, kneeling beside one of\nthe stones, feeling the rough gash in the granite surface. “In my visions, I\nwitnessed a stone monster that ripped itself free of the underlying rock.\n“There are no corpses, but that’s probably because the Almighty didn’t\npopulate the city in this vision. He just wanted a symbol of the coming\ndestruction. He didn’t think Kholinar would fall to the Everstorm, but to the\nVoidbringers.”\nYes, the Stormfather said. The storm will be a catastrophe, but not nearly\non the scale of what follows. You can find refuge from storms, Son of Honor.\nNot so with our enemies."

        "text": "Voidbringers.”\nYes, the Stormfather said. The storm will be a catastrophe, but not nearly\non the scale of what follows. You can find refuge from storms, Son of Honor.\nNot so with our enemies.\nNow that the monarchs of Roshar had refused to listen to Dalinar’s\nwarning that the Everstorm would soon strike them, what else could Dalinar\ndo? The real Kholinar was reportedly consumed by riots—and the queen\nhad gone silent. Dalinar’s armies had limped away from their first\nconfrontation with the Voidbringers, and even many of his own highprinces\nhadn’t joined him in that battle.\nA war was coming. In awakening the Desolation, the enemy had\nrekindled a millennia-old conflict of ancient creatures with inscrutable\nmotivations and unknown powers. Heralds were supposed to appear and\nlead the charge against the Voidbringers. The Knights Radiant should have\nalready been in place, prepared and trained, ready to face the enemy. They\nwere supposed to be able to trust in the guidance of the Almighty.\nInstead, Dalinar had only a handful of new Radiants, and there was no\nsign of help from the Heralds. And beyond that, the Almighty—God\nhimself—was dead.\nSomehow, Dalinar was supposed to save the world anyway.\nThe ground started to tremble; the vision was ending with the land\nfalling away. Atop the cliff, the Almighty would have just concluded his\nspeech.\nA final wave of destruction rolled across the land like a highstorm. A\nmetaphor designed by the Almighty to represent the darkness and\ndevastation that was coming upon humankind.\nYour legends say that you won, he had said. But the truth is that we lost.\nAnd we are losing.…\nThe Stormfather rumbled. It is time to go.\n“No,” Dalinar said, standing atop the rubble. “Leave me.”\nBut—\n“Let me feel it!”\nThe wave of destruction struck, crashing against Dalinar, and he shouted\ndefiance. He had not bowed before the highstorm; he would not bow before\nthis! He faced it head-on, and in the blast of power that ripped apart the\nground, he saw something.\nA golden light, brilliant yet terrible. Standing before it, a dark figure in\nblack Shardplate. The figure had nine shadows, each spreading out in a\ndifferent direction, and its eyes glowed a brilliant red.\nDalinar stared deep into those eyes, and felt a chill wash through him.\nThough the destruction raged around him, vaporizing rocks, those eyes\nfrightened him more. He saw something terribly familiar in them.\nThis was a danger far beyond even the storms.\nThis was the enemy’s champion. And he was coming.\nUNITE THEM. QUICKLY.\nDalinar gasped as the vision shattered. He found himself sitting beside\nNavani in a quiet stone room in the tower city of Urithiru. Dalinar didn’t\nneed to be bound for visions any longer; he had enough control over them\nthat he had ceased acting them out while experiencing them.\nHe breathed deeply, sweat trickling down his face, his heart racing.\nNavani said something, but for the moment he couldn’t hear her. She\nseemed distant compared to the rushing in his ears.\n“What was that light I saw?” he whispered."

She\nseemed distant compared to the rushing in his ears.\n“What was that light I saw?” he whispered.\nI saw no light, the Stormfather said.\n“It was brilliant and golden, but terrible,” Dalinar whispered. “It bathed\neverything in its heat.”\nOdium, the Stormfather rumbled. The enemy.\nThe god who had killed the Almighty. The force behind the Desolations.\n“Nine shadows,” Dalinar whispered, trembling.\nNine shadows? The Unmade. His minions, ancient spren.\nStorms. Dalinar knew of them from legend only. Terrible spren who\ntwisted the minds of men.\nStill, those eyes haunted him. As frightening as it was to contemplate the\nUnmade, he feared that figure with the red eyes the most. Odium’s\nchampion.\nDalinar blinked, looking to Navani, the woman he loved, her face\npainfully concerned as she held his arm. In this strange place and stranger\ntime, she was something real. Something to hold on to. A mature beauty—\nin some ways the picture of a perfect Vorin woman: lush lips, light violet\neyes, silvering black hair in perfect braids, curves accentuated by the tight\nsilk havah. No man would ever accuse Navani of being scrawny.\n“Dalinar?” she asked. “Dalinar, what happened? Are you well?”\n“I’m…” He drew in a deep breath. “I’m well, Navani. And I know what\nwe must do.”\nHer frown deepened. “What?”\n“I have to unite the world against the enemy faster than he can destroy\nit.”\nHe had to find a way to make the other monarchs of the world listen to\nhim. He had to prepare them for the new storm and the Voidbringers. And,\nbarring that, he had to help them survive the effects.\nBut if he succeeded, he wouldn’t have to face the Desolation alone. This\nwas not a matter of one nation against the Voidbringers. He needed the\nkingdoms of the world to join him, and he needed to find the Knights\nRadiant who were being created among their populations.\nUnite them.\n“Dalinar,” she said, “I think that’s a worthy goal … but storms, what of\nourselves? This mountainside is a wasteland—what are we going to feed\nour armies?”\n“The Soulcasters—”\n“Will run out of gemstones eventually,” Navani said. “And they can\ncreate only the basic necessities. Dalinar, we’re half frozen up here, broken\nand divided. Our command structure is in disarray, and it—”\n“Peace, Navani,” Dalinar said, rising. He pulled her to her feet. “I know.\nWe have to fight anyway.”\nShe embraced him. He held to her, feeling her warmth, smelling her\nperfume. She preferred a less floral scent than other women—a fragrance\nwith spice to it, like the aroma of newly cut wood.\n“We can do this,” he told her. “My tenacity. Your brilliance. Together, we\nwill convince the other kingdoms to join with us. They’ll see when the\nstorm returns that our warnings were right, and they’ll unite against the\nenemy. We can use the Oathgates to move troops and to support each\nother.”"

Ten portals, ancient fabrials, were gateways to Urithiru.\nWhen a Knight Radiant activated one of the devices, those people standing\nupon its surrounding platform were brought to Urithiru, appearing on a\nsimilar device here at the tower.\nThey only had one pair of Oathgates active now—the ones that moved\npeople back and forth between Urithiru and the Shattered Plains. Nine more\ncould theoretically be made to work—but unfortunately, their research\ndetermined that a mechanism inside each of them had to be unlocked from\nboth sides before they’d work.\nIf he wanted to travel to Vedenar, Thaylen City, Azimir, or any of the\nother locations, they’d first need to get one of their Radiants to the city and\nunlock the device.\n“All right,” she said. “We’ll do it. Somehow we’ll make them listen—\neven if they’ve got their fingers planted firmly in their ears. Makes one\nwonder how they manage it, with their heads rammed up their own\nbacksides.”\nHe smiled, and suddenly thought himself foolish for idealizing her just\nearlier. Navani Kholin was not some timid, perfect ideal—she was a sour\nstorm of a woman, set in her ways, stubborn as a boulder rolling down a\nmountain and increasingly impatient with things she considered foolish.\nHe loved her the most for that. For being open and genuine in a society\nthat prided itself on secrets. She’d been breaking taboos, and hearts, since\ntheir youth. At times, the idea that she loved him back seemed as surreal as\none of his visions.\nA knock came at the door to his room, and Navani called for the person\nto enter. One of Dalinar’s scouts poked her head in through the door.\nDalinar turned, frowning, noting the woman’s nervous posture and quick\nbreathing.\n“What?” he demanded.\n“Sir,” the woman said, saluting, face pale. “There’s … been an incident.\nA corpse discovered in the corridors.”\nDalinar felt something building, an energy in the air like the sensation of\nlightning about to strike. “Who?”\n“Highprince Torol Sadeas, sir,” the woman said. “He’s been murdered.”\n2. One Problem Solved\nI needed to write it anyway.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\n“Stop! What do you think you’re doing?” Adolin Kholin strode over to a\ngroup of workers in crem-stained work outfits who were unloading boxes\nfrom the back of a wagon. Their chull twisted, trying to search out rockbuds\nto munch on. Fruitlessly. They were deep within the tower, for all the fact\nthat this cavern was as large as a small town.\nThe workers had the decency to look chagrined, though they probably\ndidn’t know what for. A flock of scribes trailing Adolin checked the\ncontents of the wagon. Oil lamps on the ground did little to push back the\ndarkness of the enormous room, which had a ceiling that went up four\nstories.\n“Brightlord?” one of the workers asked, scratching at his hair beneath his"

That’s what I think I was doin’.”\n“Manifest says beer,” Rushu—a young ardent—told Adolin.\n“Section two,” Adolin said, rapping the knuckles of his left hand against\nthe wagon. “Taverns are being set up along the central corridor with the\nlifts, six crossroads inward. My aunt expressly told your highlords this.”\nThe men just stared at him blankly.\n“I can have a scribe show you. Pick these boxes back up.”\nThe men sighed, but started reloading their wagon. They knew better\nthan to argue with the son of a highprince.\nAdolin turned to survey the deep cavern, which had become a dumping\nground for both supplies and people. Children ran past in groups. Workers\nset up tents. Women gathered water at the well in the center. Soldiers\ncarried torches or lanterns. Even axehounds raced this way and that. Four\nentire warcamps full of people had frantically crossed the Shattered Plains\nto Urithiru, and Navani had struggled to find the right spot for them all.\nFor all the chaos, though, Adolin was glad to have these people. They\nwere fresh; they hadn’t suffered the battle with the Parshendi, the attack of\nthe Assassin in White, and the terrible clash of two storms.\nThe Kholin soldiers were in terrible shape. Adolin’s own sword hand\nwas wrapped and still throbbing, his wrist broken during the fighting. His\nface had a nasty bruise, and he was one of the more lucky ones.\n“Brightlord,” Rushu said, pointing at another wagon. “That looks like\nwines.”\n“Delightful,” Adolin said. Was nobody paying attention to Aunt Navani’s\ndirectives?\nHe dealt with this wagon, then had to break up an argument among men\nwho were angry they had been set to hauling water. They claimed that was\nparshman work, beneath their nahn. Unfortunately, there were no parshmen\nany longer.\nAdolin soothed them and suggested they could start a water haulers’\nguild if forced to continue. Father would approve that for certain, though\nAdolin worried. Would they have the funds to pay all these people? Wages\nwere based on a man’s rank, and you couldn’t just make slaves of men for\nno reason.\nAdolin was glad for the assignment, to distract him. Though he didn’t\nhave to see to each wagon himself—he was here to supervise—he threw\nhimself into the details of the work. He couldn’t exactly spar, not with his\nwrist in this shape, but if he sat alone too long he started thinking about\nwhat had happened the day before.\nHad he really done that?\nHad he really murdered Torol Sadeas?\nIt was almost a relief when at long last a runner came for him,\nwhispering that something had been discovered in the corridors of the third\nfloor.\nAdolin was certain he knew what it was.\n* * *\nDalinar heard the shouts long before he arrived.

Conflict was near.\nHe left Navani and broke into a run, sweating as he burst into a wide\nintersection between tunnels. Men in blue, lit by the harsh light of lanterns,\nfaced off against others in forest green. Angerspren grew from the floor like\npools of blood.\nA corpse with a green jacket draped over the face lay on the ground.\n“Stand down!” Dalinar bellowed, charging into the space between the\ntwo groups of soldiers. He pulled back a bridgeman who had gotten right up\nin the face of one of Sadeas’s soldiers. “Stand down, or I’ll have you all in\nthe stockade, every man!”\nHis voice hit the men like stormwinds, drawing eyes from both sides. He\npushed the bridgeman toward his fellows, then shoved back one of Sadeas’s\nsoldiers, praying the man would have the presence of mind to resist\nattacking a highprince.\nNavani and the scout stopped at the fringes of the conflict. The men from\nBridge Four finally backed down one corridor, and Sadeas’s soldiers\nretreated up the one opposite. Just far enough that they could still glare at\none another.\n“You’d better be ready for Damnation’s own thunder,” Sadeas’s officer\nshouted at Dalinar. “Your men murdered a highprince!”\n“We found him like this!” Teft of Bridge Four shouted back. “Probably\ntripped on his own knife. Serves him well, the storming bastard.”\n“Teft, stand down!” Dalinar shouted at him.\nThe bridgeman looked abashed, then saluted with a stiff gesture.\nDalinar knelt, pulling the jacket back from Sadeas’s face. “That blood is\ndried. He’s been lying here for some time.”\n“We’ve been looking for him,” said the officer in green.\n“Looking for him? You lost your highprince?”\n“The tunnels are confusing!” the man said. “They don’t go natural\ndirections. We got turned about and…”\n“Thought he might have returned to another part of the tower,” a man\nsaid. “We spent last night searching for him there. Some people said they\nthought they’d seen him, but they were wrong, and…”\nAnd a highprince was left lying here in his own gore for half a day,\nDalinar thought. Blood of my fathers.\n“We couldn’t find him,” the officer said, “because your men murdered\nhim and moved the body—”\n“That blood has been pooling there for hours. Nobody moved the body.”\nDalinar pointed. “Place the highprince in that side room there and send for\nIalai, if you haven’t. I want to have a better look.”\n* * *\nDalinar Kholin was a connoisseur of death.\nEven since his youth, the sight of dead men had been a familiar thing to\nhim. You stay on the battlefield long enough, and you become familiar with\nits master.\nSo Sadeas’s bloodied, ruined face didn’t shock him.

It was a maneuver you practiced to use on the\nbattlefield. But Sadeas had not been wearing armor and had not been on a\nbattlefield.\nDalinar leaned down, inspecting the body lit by flickering oil lanterns as\nit lay on the table.\n“Assassin,” Navani said, clicking her tongue and shaking her head. “Not\ngood.”\nBehind him, Adolin and Renarin gathered with Shallan and a few of the\nbridgemen. Across from Dalinar stood Kalami; the thin, orange-eyed\nwoman was one of his more senior scribes. They’d lost her husband, Teleb,\nin the battle against the Voidbringers. He hated to call upon her in her time\nof grief, but she insisted that she remain on duty.\nStorms, he had so few high officers left. Cael had fallen in the clash\nbetween Everstorm and highstorm, almost making it to safety. He’d lost\nIlamar and Perethom to Sadeas’s betrayal at the Tower. The only highlord\nhe had left was Khal, who was still recuperating from a wound he’d taken\nduring the clash with the Voidbringers—one he’d kept to himself until\neveryone else was safe.\nEven Elhokar, the king, had been wounded by assassins in his palace\nwhile the armies were fighting at Narak. He’d been recuperating ever since.\nDalinar wasn’t certain if he would come to see Sadeas’s body or not.\nEither way, Dalinar’s lack of officers explained the room’s other\noccupants: Highprince Sebarial and his mistress, Palona. Likable or not,\nSebarial was one of the two living highprinces who had responded to\nDalinar’s call to march for Narak. Dalinar had to rely on someone, and he\ndidn’t trust most of the highprinces farther than the wind could blow them.\nSebarial, along with Aladar—who had been summoned but had not yet\narrived—would have to form the foundation of a new Alethkar. Almighty\nhelp them all.\n“Well!” said Palona, hands on hips as she regarded Sadeas’s corpse. “I\nguess that’s one problem solved!”\nEveryone in the room turned toward her.\n“What?” she said. “Don’t tell me you weren’t all thinking it.”\n“This is going to look bad, Brightlord,” Kalami said. “Everyone is going\nto act like those soldiers outside and assume you had him assassinated.”\n“Any sign of the Shardblade?” Dalinar asked.\n“No, sir,” one of the bridgemen said. “Whoever killed him probably took\nit.”\nNavani rubbed Dalinar on the shoulder. “I wouldn’t have put it as Palona\ndid, but he did try to have you killed. Perhaps this is for the best.”\n“No,” Dalinar said, voice hoarse. “We needed him.”\n“I know you’re desperate, Dalinar,” Sebarial said. “My presence here is"

Sebarial and Palona.\nTeft and Sigzil, the lieutenants from Bridge Four. A handful of other\nsoldiers, including the young scout woman who had fetched him. His sons,\nsteady Adolin and impenetrable Renarin. Navani, with her hand on his\nshoulder. Even the aging Kalami, hands clasped before her, meeting his\neyes and nodding.\n“You all agree, don’t you?” Dalinar asked.\nNobody objected. Yes, this murder was inconvenient for Dalinar’s\nreputation, and they certainly wouldn’t have gone so far as to kill Sadeas\nthemselves. But now that he was gone … well, why shed any tears?\nMemories churned inside Dalinar’s head. Days spent with Sadeas,\nlistening to Gavilar’s grand plans. The night before Dalinar’s wedding,\nwhen he’d shared wine with Sadeas at a rowdy feast that Sadeas had\norganized in his name.\nIt was hard to reconcile that younger man, that friend, with the thicker,\nolder face on the slab before him. The adult Sadeas had been a murderer\nwhose treachery had caused the deaths of better men. For those men,\nabandoned during the battle at the Tower, Dalinar could feel only\nsatisfaction at finally seeing Sadeas dead.\nThat troubled him. He knew exactly how the others were feeling. “Come\nwith me.”\nHe left the body and strode out of the room. He passed Sadeas’s guards,\nwho hurried back in. They would deal with the corpse; hopefully he’d\ndefused the situation enough to prevent an impromptu clash between his\nforces and theirs. For now, the best thing to do was get Bridge Four away\nfrom here.\nDalinar’s retinue followed him through the halls of the cavernous tower,\nbearing oil lamps. The walls were twisted with lines—natural strata of\nalternating earthy colors, like those made by crem drying in layers. He\ndidn’t blame the soldiers for losing track of Sadeas; it was strikingly easy to\nget lost in this place, with its endless passageways all leading into darkness.\nFortunately, he had an idea of where they were, and led his people to the\nouter rim of the tower. Here he strode through an empty chamber and\nstepped out onto a balcony, one of many similar ones that were like wide\npatios.\nAbove him rose the enormous tower city of Urithiru, a strikingly high\nstructure built up against the mountains. Created from a sequence of ten\nringlike tiers—each containing eighteen levels—the tower city was adorned\nwith aqueducts, windows, and balconies like this one.\nThe bottom floor also had wide sections jutting out at the perimeter:\nlarge stone surfaces, each a plateau in its own right.

But the furrows in the stone, and planter boxes on the inner\nedges, had revealed their purpose. Somehow, these were fields. Like the\nlarge spaces for gardens atop each tier of the tower, this area had been\nfarmed, despite the cold. One of these fields extended below this balcony,\ntwo levels down.\nDalinar strode up to the edge of the balcony and rested his hands on the\nsmooth stone retaining wall. The others gathered behind him. Along the\nway they’d picked up Highprince Aladar, a distinguished bald Alethi with\ndark tan skin. He was accompanied by May, his daughter: a short, pretty\nwoman in her twenties with tan eyes and a round face, her jet-black Alethi\nhair worn short and curving around her face. Navani whispered to them the\ndetails of Sadeas’s death.\nDalinar swept his hand outward in the chill air, pointing away from the\nbalcony. “What do you see?”\nThe bridgemen gathered to look off the balcony. Their number included\nthe Herdazian, who now had two arms after regrowing the one with\nStormlight. Kaladin’s men had begun manifesting powers as Windrunners\n—though apparently they were merely “squires.” Navani said it was a type\nof apprentice Radiant that had once been common: men and women whose\nabilities were tied to their master, a full Radiant.\nThe men of Bridge Four had not bonded their own spren, and—though\nthey had started manifesting powers—had lost their abilities when Kaladin\nhad flown to Alethkar to warn his family of the Everstorm.\n“What do I see?” the Herdazian said. “I see clouds.”\n“Lots of clouds,” another bridgeman added.\n“Some mountains too,” another said. “They look like teeth.”\n“Nah, horns,” the Herdazian argued.\n“We,” Dalinar interrupted, “are above the storms. It’s going to be easy to\nforget the tempest the rest of the world is facing. The Everstorm will return,\nbringing the Voidbringers. We have to assume that this city—our armies—\nwill soon be the only bastion of order left in the world. It is our calling, our\nduty, to take the lead.”\n“Order?” Aladar said. “Dalinar, have you seen our armies? They fought\nan impossible battle only six days ago, and despite being rescued, we\ntechnically lost. Roion’s son is woefully underprepared for dealing with the\nremnants of his princedom. Some of the strongest forces—those of\nThanadal and Vamah—stayed behind in the warcamps!”\n“The ones who did come are already squabbling,” Palona added. “Old\nTorol’s death back there will only give them something else to dissent\nabout.”\nDalinar turned around, gripping the top of the stone wall with both\nhands, fingers cold. A chill wind blew against him, and a few windspren\npassed like little translucent people riding on the breeze.\n“Brightness Kalami,” Dalinar said. “What do you know of the\nDesolations?”\n“Brightlord?” she asked, hesitant."

You’ve done scholarly work on Vorin theory, yes? Can\nyou tell us of the Desolations?”\nKalami cleared her throat. “They were destruction made manifest,\nBrightlord. Each one was so profoundly devastating that humankind was\nleft broken. Populations ruined, society crippled, scholars dead. Humankind\nwas forced to spend generations rebuilding after each one. Songs tell of\nhow the losses compounded upon one another, causing us to slide farther\neach time, until the Heralds left a people with swords and fabrials and\nreturned to find them wielding sticks and stone axes.”\n“And the Voidbringers?” Dalinar asked.\n“They came to annihilate,” Kalami said. “Their goal was to wipe\nhumankind from Roshar. They were specters, formless—some say they are\nspirits of the dead, others spren from Damnation.”\n“We will have to find a way to stop this from happening again,” Dalinar\nsaid softly, turning back to the group. “We are the ones this world must be\nable to look to. We must provide stability, a rallying point.\n“This is why I cannot rejoice to find Sadeas dead. He was a thorn in my\nside, but he was a capable general and a brilliant mind. We needed him.\nBefore this is through, we’ll need everyone who can fight.”\n“Dalinar,” Aladar said. “I used to bicker. I used to be like the other\nhighprinces. But what I saw on that battlefield … those red eyes … Sir, I’m\nwith you. I will follow you to the ends of the storms themselves. What do\nyou want me to do?”\n“Our time is short. Aladar, I name you our new Highprince of\nInformation, in command of the judgment and law of this city. Establish\norder in Urithiru and make sure that the highprinces have clearly delineated\nrealms of control within it. Build a policing force, and patrol these\nhallways. Keep the peace, and prevent clashes between soldiers like the one\nwe avoided earlier.\n“Sebarial, I name you Highprince of Commerce. Account our supplies\nand establish marketplaces in Urithiru. I want this tower to become a\nfunctioning city, not just a temporary waystop.\n“Adolin, see that the armies are put into a training regimen. Count the\ntroops we have, from all the highprinces, and convey to them that their\nspears will be required for the defense of Roshar. So long as they remain\nhere, they are under my authority as Highprince of War. We’ll crush their\nsquabbling beneath a weight of training. We control the Soulcasters, and we\ncontrol the food. If they want rations, they’ll have to listen.”\n“And us?” the scruffy lieutenant of Bridge Four asked.\n“Continue to explore Urithiru with my scouts and scribes,” Dalinar said.\n“And let me know the moment your captain returns. Hopefully he will bring\ngood news from Alethkar.”\nHe took a deep breath. A voice echoed in the back of his mind, as if\ndistant. Unite them."

Unite them.\nBe ready for when the enemy’s champion arrives.\n“Our ultimate goal is the preservation of all Roshar,” Dalinar said softly.\n“We’ve seen the cost of division in our ranks. Because of it, we failed to\nstop the Everstorm. But that was just the trial run, the sparring before the\nreal fight. To face the Desolation, I will find a way to do what my ancestor\nthe Sunmaker failed to do through conquest. I will unify Roshar.”\nKalami gasped softly. No man had ever united the entire continent—not\nduring the Shin invasions, not during the height of the Hierocracy, not\nduring the Sunmaker’s conquest. This was his task, he was increasingly\ncertain. The enemy would unleash his worst terrors: the Unmade and the\nVoidbringers. That phantom champion in the dark armor.\nDalinar would resist them with a unified Roshar. Such a shame he hadn’t\nfound a way to somehow convince Sadeas to join in his cause.\nAh, Torol, he thought. What we could have done together, if we hadn’t\nbeen so divided.…\n“Father?” A soft voice drew his attention. Renarin, who stood beside\nShallan and Adolin. “You didn’t mention us. Me and Brightness Shallan.\nWhat is our task?”\n“To practice,” Dalinar said. “Other Radiants will be coming to us, and\nyou two will need to lead them. The knights were once our greatest weapon\nagainst the Voidbringers. They will need to be so again.”\n“Father, I…” Renarin stumbled over the words. “It’s just … Me? I can’t.\nI don’t know how to … let alone…”\n“Son,” Dalinar said, stepping over. He took Renarin by the shoulder. “I\ntrust you. The Almighty and the spren have granted you powers to defend\nand protect this people. Use them. Master them, then report back to me\nwhat you can do. I think we’re all curious to find out.”\nRenarin exhaled softly, then nodded.\n3. Momentum\nTHIRTY-FOUR YEARS AGO\nRockbuds crunched like skulls beneath Dalinar’s boots as he charged across\nthe burning field. His elites pounded after him, a handpicked force of\nsoldiers both lighteyed and dark. They weren’t an honor guard. Dalinar\ndidn’t need guards. These were simply the men he considered competent\nenough not to embarrass him.\nAround him, rockbuds smoldered. Moss—dried from the summer heat\nand long days between storms this time of year—flared up in waves, setting\nthe rockbud shells alight. Flamespren danced among them. And, like a spren\nhimself, Dalinar charged through the smoke, trusting in his padded armor\nand thick boots to protect him.\nThe enemy—pressed on the north by his armies—had pulled back into\nthis town just ahead.

Well, the fires could go to\nDamnation. Though some of his men were overwhelmed by the smoke or\nheat, most stayed with him. They’d crash into the enemy, pressing them\nback against the main army.\nHammer and anvil. His favorite kind of tactic: the type that didn’t allow\nhis enemies to get away from him.\nAs Dalinar burst from the smoky air, he found a few lines of spearmen\nhastily forming ranks on the southern edge of the town. Anticipationspren—\nlike red streamers growing from the ground and whipping in the wind—\nclustered around them. The low town wall had been torn down in a contest\na few years back, so the soldiers had only rubble as a fortification—though\na large ridge to the east made a natural windbreak against the storms, which\nhad allowed this place to sprawl almost like a real city.\nDalinar bellowed at the enemy soldiers, beating his sword—just an\nordinary longsword—against his shield. He wore a sturdy breastplate, an\nopen-fronted helm, and iron-reinforced boots. The spearmen ahead of him\nwavered as his elites roared from amid the smoke and flame, shouting a\nbloodthirsty cacophony.\nA few of the spearmen dropped their weapons and ran. Dalinar grinned.\nHe didn’t need Shards to intimidate.\nHe hit the spearmen like a boulder rolling through a grove of saplings,\nhis sword tossing blood into the air. A good fight was about momentum.\nDon’t stop. Don’t think. Drive forward and convince your enemies that\nthey’re as good as dead already. That way, they’ll fight you less as you send\nthem to their pyres.\nThe spearmen thrust their spears frantically—less to try to kill, more to\ntry to push away this madman. Their ranks collapsed as too many of them\nturned their attention toward him.\nDalinar laughed, slamming aside a pair of spears with his shield, then\ndisemboweling one man with a blade deep in the gut. The man dropped his\nspear in agony, and his neighbors backed away at the horrific sight. Dalinar\ncame in with a roar, killing them with a sword that bore their friend’s blood.\nDalinar’s elites struck the now-broken line, and the real slaughter began.\nHe pushed forward, keeping momentum, shearing through the ranks until he\nreached the back, then breathed deeply and wiped ashen sweat from his\nface. A young spearman wept on the ground nearby, screaming for his\nmother as he crawled across the stone, trailing blood. Fearspren mixed with\norange, sinewy painspren all around. Dalinar shook his head and rammed\nhis sword down into the boy’s back as he passed.\nMen often cried for their parents as they died. Didn’t matter how old\nthey were. He’d seen greybeards do it, same as kids like this one. He’s not\nmuch younger than me, Dalinar thought. Maybe seventeen.

Dalinar danced, shaking off his\nbloodied blade, feeling alert, excited, but not yet alive. Where was it?\nCome on.…\nA larger group of enemy soldiers was jogging down the street toward\nhim, led by several officers in white and red. From the way they suddenly\npulled up, he guessed they were alarmed to find their spearmen falling so\nquickly.\nDalinar charged. His elites knew to watch, so he was rapidly joined by\nfifty men—the rest had to finish off the unfortunate spearmen. Fifty would\ndo. The crowded confines of the town would mean Dalinar shouldn’t need\nmore.\nHe focused his attention on the one man riding a horse. The fellow wore\nplate armor obviously meant to resemble Shardplate, though it was only of\ncommon steel. It lacked the beauty, the power, of true Plate. He still looked\nlike he was the most important person around. Hopefully that would mean\nhe was the best.\nThe man’s honor guard rushed to engage, and Dalinar felt something stir\ninside him. Like a thirst, a physical need.\nChallenge. He needed a challenge!\nHe engaged the first member of the guard, attacking with a swift\nbrutality. Fighting on a battlefield wasn’t like dueling in an arena; Dalinar\ndidn’t dance around the fellow, testing his abilities. Out here, that sort of\nthing got you stabbed in the back by someone else. Instead, Dalinar\nslammed his sword down against the enemy, who raised his shield to block.\nDalinar struck a series of quick, powerful blows, like a drummer pounding\nout a furious beat. Bam, bam, bam, bam!\nThe enemy soldier clutched his shield over his head, leaving Dalinar\nsquarely in control. Dalinar raised his own shield before him and shoved it\nagainst the man, forcing him back until he stumbled, giving Dalinar an\nopening.\nThis man didn’t get a chance to cry for his mother.\nThe body dropped before him. Dalinar let his elites handle the others; the\nway was open to the brightlord. Who was he? The highprince fought to the\nnorth. Was this some other important lighteyes? Or … didn’t Dalinar\nremember hearing something about a son during Gavilar’s endless planning\nmeetings?\nWell, this man certainly looked grand on that white mare, watching the\nbattle from within his helm’s visor, cape streaming around him. The foe\nraised his sword to his helm toward Dalinar in a sign of challenge accepted.\nIdiot.\nDalinar raised his shield arm and pointed, counting on at least one of his\nstrikers to have stayed with him. Indeed, Jenin stepped up, unhooked the\nshortbow from his back, and—as the brightlord shouted his surprise—shot\nthe horse in the chest.\n“Hate shooting horses,” Jenin grumbled as the beast reared in pain.\n“Like throwing a thousand broams into the storming ocean, Brightlord.”\n“I’ll buy you two when we finish this,” Dalinar said as the brightlord\ntumbled off his horse. Dalinar dodged around flashing hooves and squeals\nof pain, seeking out the fallen man. He was pleased to find the enemy\nrising."

He was pleased to find the enemy\nrising.\nThey engaged, sweeping at one another, frantic. Life was about\nmomentum. Pick a direction and don’t let anything—man or storm—turn\nyou aside. Dalinar battered at the brightlord, driving him backward, furious\nand persistent.\nHe felt like he was winning the contest, controlling it, right up until he\nslammed his shield at the enemy and—in the moment of stress—felt\nsomething snap. One of the straps that held the shield to his arm had\nbroken.\nThe enemy reacted immediately. He shoved the shield, twisting it around\nDalinar’s arm, snapping the other strap. The shield tumbled free.\nDalinar staggered, sweeping with his sword, trying to parry a blow that\ndidn’t come. The brightlord instead lunged in close and rammed Dalinar\nwith his shield.\nDalinar ducked the blow that followed, but the backhand hit him solidly\non the side of the head, sending him stumbling. His helm twisted, bent\nmetal biting into his scalp, drawing blood. He saw double, his vision\nswimming.\nHe’s coming in for the kill.\nDalinar roared, swinging his blade up in a lurching, wild parry that\nconnected with the brightlord’s weapon and swept it completely out of his\nhands.\nThe man instead punched Dalinar in the face with a gauntlet. His nose\ncrunched.\nDalinar fell to his knees, sword slipping from his fingers. His foe was\nbreathing deeply, cursing between breaths, winded by the short, frantic\ncontest. He reached to his belt for a knife.\nAn emotion stirred inside Dalinar.\nIt was a fire that filled the pit within. It washed through him and\nawakened him, bringing clarity. The sounds of his elites fighting the\nbrightlord’s honor guard faded, metal on metal becoming clinks, grunts\nbecoming merely a distant humming.\nDalinar smiled. Then the smile became a toothy grin. His vision returned\nas the brightlord—knife in hand—looked up and started, stumbling back.\nHe seemed horrified.\nDalinar roared, spitting blood and throwing himself at the enemy. The\nswing that came at him seemed pitiful and Dalinar ducked it, ramming his\nshoulder against his foe’s lower body. Something thrummed inside Dalinar,\nthe pulse of the battle, the rhythm of killing and dying.\nThe Thrill.\nHe knocked his opponent off balance, then went searching for his sword.\nDym, however, hollered Dalinar’s name and tossed him a poleaxe, with a\nhook on one side and a broad, thin axe blade on the other. Dalinar seized it\nfrom the air and spun, hooking the brightlord around the ankle with the\naxehead, then yanked.\nThe brightlord fell in a clatter of steel. Before Dalinar could capitalize on\nthis, two men of the honor guard managed to extricate themselves from\nDalinar’s men and come to the defense of their brightlord.\nDalinar swung and buried the axehead into one guard’s side.

He ripped it\nfree and spun again—smashing the weapon down on the rising brightlord’s\nhelm and sending him to his knees—before coming back and barely\ncatching the remaining guard’s sword on the haft of the poleaxe.\nDalinar pushed upward, holding the poleaxe in two hands, sweeping the\nguard’s blade into the air over his head. Dalinar stepped forward until he\nwas face-to-face with the fellow. He could feel the man’s breath.\nHe spat blood draining from his nose into the guard’s eyes, then kicked\nhim in the stomach. He turned toward the brightlord, who was trying to flee.\nDalinar growled, full of the Thrill. He swung the poleaxe with one hand,\nhooking the spike into the brightlord’s side, and yanked, dropping him yet\nagain.\nThe brightlord rolled over. He was greeted by the sight of Dalinar\nslamming his poleaxe down with both hands, driving the spike right\nthrough the breastplate and into his chest. It made a satisfying crunch, and\nDalinar pulled it out bloodied.\nAs if that blow had been a signal, the honor guard finally broke before\nhis elites. Dalinar grinned as he watched them go, gloryspren popping up\naround him as glowing golden spheres. His men unhooked shortbows and\nshot a good dozen of the fleeing enemy in the back. Damnation, it felt good\nto best a force larger than your own.\nNearby, the fallen brightlord groaned softly. “Why…” the man said from\nwithin his helm. “Why us?”\n“Don’t know,” Dalinar said, tossing the poleaxe back to Dym.\n“You … you don’t know?” the dying man said.\n“My brother chooses,” Dalinar said. “I just go where he points me.” He\ngestured toward the dying man, and Dym rammed a sword into the armored\nman’s armpit, finishing the job. The fellow had fought reasonably well; no\nneed to extend his suffering.\nAnother soldier approached, handing Dalinar his sword. It had a chip the\nsize of a thumb right in the blade. Looked like it had bent as well. “You’re\nsupposed to stick it into the squishy parts, Brightlord,” Dym said, “not\npound it against the hard parts.”\n“I’ll keep that in mind,” Dalinar said, tossing the sword aside as one of\nhis men selected a replacement from among the fallen.\n“You … all right, Brightlord?” Dym asked.\n“Never been better,” Dalinar said, voice faintly distorted by the clogged\nnose. Hurt like Damnation itself, and he drew a small flock of painspren—\nlike little sinewy hands—up from the ground.\nHis men formed up around him, and Dalinar led the way farther down\nthe street. Before too long, he could make out the bulk of the enemy still\nfighting ahead, harried by his army. He halted his men, considering his\noptions.\nThakka, captain of the elites, turned to him. “Orders, sir?”\n“Raid those buildings,” Dalinar said, pointing at a line of homes. “Let’s\nsee how well they fight while they watch us rounding up their families.”\n“The men will want to loot,” Thakka said."

Soggy hogshide and old\nrockbud bowls?” He pulled off his helm to wipe the blood from his face.\n“They can loot afterward. Right now I need hostages. There are civilians\nsomewhere in this storming town. Find them.”\nThakka nodded, shouting the orders. Dalinar reached for some water.\nHe’d need to meet up with Sadeas, and—\nSomething slammed into Dalinar’s shoulder. He caught only a brief sight\nof it, a black blur that hit with the force of a roundhouse kick. It threw him\ndown, and pain flared up from his side.\nHe blinked as he found himself lying on the ground. A storming arrow\nsprouted from his right shoulder, with a long, thick shaft. It had gone\nstraight through the chain mail, just to the side of where his cuirass met his\narm.\n“Brightlord!” Thakka said, kneeling, shielding Dalinar with his body.\n“Kelek! Brightlord, are you—”\n“Who in Damnation shot that?” Dalinar demanded.\n“Up there,” one of his men said, pointing at the ridge above the town.\n“That’s got to be over three hundred yards,” Dalinar said, shoving\nThakka aside and standing. “That can’t—”\nHe was watching, so he was able to jump out of the way of the next\narrow, which dropped a mere foot from him, cracking against the stone\nground. Dalinar stared at it, then started shouting. “Horses! Where are the\nstorming horses!”\nA small group of soldiers came trotting forward, bringing all eleven\nhorses, which they’d guided carefully across the field. Dalinar had to dodge\nanother arrow as he seized the reins of Fullnight, his black gelding, and\nheaved himself into the saddle. The arrow in his arm was a cutting pain, but\nhe felt something more pressing drawing him forward. Helping him focus.\nHe galloped back the way they’d come in, getting out of the archer’s\nsight, trailed by ten of his best men. There had to be a way up that slope.…\nThere! A rocky set of switchbacks, shallow enough that he didn’t mind\nrunning Fullnight up them.\nDalinar worried that by the time he reached the top, his quarry would\nhave escaped. However, when he eventually burst onto the top of the ridge,\nan arrow slammed into his left breast, going straight through the breastplate\nnear the shoulder, nearly throwing him from the saddle.\nDamnation! Dalinar hung on somehow, clenching the reins in one hand,\nand leaned low, peering ahead as the archer—still a distant figure—stood\nupon a rocky knob and launched another arrow. And another. Storms, the\nfellow was quick!\nHe jerked Fullnight to one side, then the other, feeling the thrumming\nsense of the Thrill surge within him.

The archer\nturned out to be a man in his twenties wearing rugged clothing, with arms\nand shoulders that looked like they could have lifted a chull. Dalinar had the\noption of running him down, but instead galloped Fullnight past and kicked\nthe man in the back, sending him sprawling.\nAs Dalinar pulled up his horse, the motion sent a spike of pain through\nhis arm. He forced it down, eyes watering, and turned toward the archer,\nwho lay in a heap amid spilled black arrows.\nDalinar lurched from the saddle, an arrow sprouting from each shoulder,\nas his men caught up. He seized the archer and hauled the fellow to his feet,\nnoting the blue tattoo on his cheek. The archer gasped and stared at Dalinar.\nHe expected he was quite a sight, covered in soot from the fires, his face a\nmask of blood from the nose and the cut scalp, stuck with not one but two\narrows.\n“You waited until my helm was off,” Dalinar demanded. “You are an\nassassin. You were set here specifically to kill me.”\nThe man winced, then nodded.\n“Amazing!” Dalinar said, letting go of the fellow. “Show me that shot\nagain. How far is that, Thakka? I’m right, aren’t I? Over three hundred\nyards?”\n“Almost four,” Thakka said, pulling over his horse. “But with a height\nadvantage.”\n“Still,” Dalinar said, stepping up to the lip of the ridge. He looked back\nat the befuddled archer. “Well? Grab your bow!”\n“My … bow?” the archer said.\n“Are you deaf, man?” Dalinar snapped. “Go get it!”\nThe archer regarded the ten elites on horseback, grim-faced and\ndangerous, before wisely deciding to obey. He picked up an arrow, then his\nbow—which was made of a sleek black wood Dalinar didn’t recognize.\n“Went right through my storming armor,” Dalinar muttered, feeling at\nthe arrow that had hit him on the left. That one didn’t seem too bad—it had\npunctured the steel, but had lost most of its momentum in doing so. The one\non his right, though, had cut through the chain and was sending blood down\nhis arm.\nHe shook his head, shading his eyes with his left hand, inspecting the\nbattlefield. To his right, the armies clashed, and his main body of elites had\ncome up to press at the flank. The rearguard had found some civilians and\nwas shoving them into the street.\n“Pick a corpse,” Dalinar said, pointing toward an empty square where a\nskirmish had happened. “Stick an arrow in one down there, if you can.”\nThe archer licked his lips, still seeming confused. Finally, he took a\nspyglass off his belt and studied the area. “The one in blue, near the\noverturned cart.”\nDalinar squinted, then nodded.

It flew true, sticking into the chosen corpse.\nA single awespren burst around Dalinar, like a ring of blue smoke.\n“Stormfather! Thakka, before today, I’d have bet you half the princedom\nthat such a shot wasn’t possible.” He turned to the archer. “What’s your\nname, assassin?”\nThe man raised his chin, but didn’t reply.\n“Well, in any case, welcome to my elites,” Dalinar said. “Someone get\nthe fellow a horse.”\n“What?” the archer said. “I tried to kill you!”\n“Yes, from a distance. Which shows remarkably good judgment. I can\nmake use of someone with your skills.”\n“We’re enemies!”\nDalinar nodded toward the town below, where the beleaguered enemy\narmy was—at long last—surrendering. “Not anymore. Looks like we’re all\nallies now!”\nThe archer spat to the side. “Slaves beneath your brother, the tyrant.”\nDalinar let one of his men help him onto his horse. “If you’d rather be\nkilled, I can respect that. Alternatively, you can join me and name your\nprice.”\n“The life of my brightlord Yezriar,” the archer said. “The heir.”\n“Is that the fellow…?” Dalinar said, looking to Thakka.\n“… That you killed down below? Yes, sir.”\n“He’s got a hole in his chest,” Dalinar said, looking back to the assassin.\n“Tough break.”\n“You … you monster! Couldn’t you have captured him?”\n“Nah. The other princedoms are digging in their heels. Refuse to\nrecognize my brother’s crown. Games of catch-me with the high lighteyes\njust encourage people to fight back. If they know we’re out for blood,\nthey’ll think twice.” Dalinar shrugged. “How about this? Join with me, and\nwe won’t pillage the town. What’s left of it, anyway.”\nThe man looked down at the surrendering army.\n“You in or not?” Dalinar said. “I promise not to make you shoot anyone\nyou like.”\n“I…”\n“Great!” Dalinar said, turning his horse and trotting off.\nA short time later, when Dalinar’s elites rode up to him, the sullen archer\nwas on a horse with one of the other men. The pain surged in Dalinar’s right\narm as the Thrill faded, but it was manageable. He’d need surgeons to look\nat the arrow wound.\nOnce they reached the town again, he sent orders to stop the looting. His\nmen would hate that, but this town wasn’t worth much anyway. The riches\nwould come once they started into the centers of the princedoms.\nHe let his horse carry him in a leisurely gait through the town, passing\nsoldiers who had settled down to water themselves and rest from the\nprotracted engagement.

He could still remember\nbeing alive, but now had to face a return to mundanity.\nHe’d missed the executions. Sadeas already had the local highprince’s\nhead—and those of his officers—up on spears. Such a showman, Sadeas\nwas. Dalinar passed the grim line, shaking his head, and heard a muttered\ncurse from his new archer. He’d have to talk to the man, reinforce that in\nstriking at Dalinar earlier, he’d shot an arrow at an enemy. That was to be\nrespected. If he tried something against Dalinar or Sadeas now, it would be\ndifferent. Thakka would already be searching out the fellow’s family.\n“Dalinar?” a voice called.\nHe stilled his horse, turning toward the sound. Torol Sadeas—\nresplendent in golden yellow Shardplate that had already been washed clean\n—pushed through a cluster of officers. The red-faced young man looked far\nolder than he had a year ago. When they’d started all this, he’d still been a\ngangly youth. No longer.\n“Dalinar, are those arrows? Stormfather, man, you look like a thornbush!\nWhat happened to your face?”\n“A fist,” Dalinar said, then nodded toward the heads on spears. “Nice\nwork.”\n“We lost the crown prince,” Sadeas said. “He’ll mount a resistance.”\n“That would be impressive,” Dalinar said, “considering what I did to\nhim.”\nSadeas relaxed visibly. “Oh, Dalinar. What would we do without you?”\n“Lose. Someone get me something to drink and a pair of surgeons. In\nthat order. Also, Sadeas, I promised we wouldn’t pillage the city. No\nlooting, no slaves taken.”\n“You what?” Sadeas demanded. “Who did you promise?”\nDalinar thumbed over his shoulder at the archer.\n“Another one?” Sadeas said with a groan.\n“He’s got amazing aim,” Dalinar said. “Loyal, too.” He glanced to the\nside, where Sadeas’s soldiers had rounded up some weeping women for\nSadeas to pick from.\n“I was looking forward to tonight,” Sadeas noted.\n“And I was looking forward to breathing through my nose. We’ll live.\nMore than can be said for the kids we fought today.”\n“Fine, fine,” Sadeas said, sighing. “I suppose we could spare one town.\nA symbol that we are not without mercy.” He looked over Dalinar again.\n“We need to get you some Shards, my friend.”\n“To protect me?”\n“Protect you? Storms, Dalinar, at this point I’m not certain a rockslide\ncould kill you. No, it just makes the rest of us look bad when you\naccomplish what you do while practically unarmed!”\nDalinar shrugged.

Oaths\nI know that many women who read this will see it only as further proof\nthat I am the godless heretic everyone claims.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nTwo days after Sadeas was found dead, the Everstorm came again.\nDalinar walked through his chambers in Urithiru, pulled by the unnatural\nstorm. Bare feet on cold rock. He passed Navani—who sat at the writing\ndesk working on her memoirs again—and stepped onto his balcony, which\nhung straight out over the cliffs beneath Urithiru.\nHe could feel something, his ears popping, cold—even more cold than\nusual—blowing in from the west. And something else. An inner chill.\n“Is that you, Stormfather?” Dalinar whispered. “This feeling of dread?”\nThis thing is not natural, the Stormfather said. It is unknown.\n“It didn’t come before, during the earlier Desolations?”\nNo. It is new.\nAs always, the Stormfather’s voice was far off, like very distant thunder.\nThe Stormfather didn’t always reply to Dalinar, and didn’t remain near him.\nThat was to be expected; he was the soul of the storm. He could not—\nshould not—be contained.\nAnd yet, there was an almost childish petulance to the way he sometimes\nignored Dalinar’s questions. It seemed that sometimes he did so merely\nbecause he didn’t want Dalinar to think that he would come whenever\ncalled.\nThe Everstorm appeared in the distance, its black clouds lit from within\nby crackling red lightning. It was low enough in the sky that—fortunately—\nits top wouldn’t reach Urithiru. It surged like a cavalry, trampling the calm,\nordinary clouds below.\nDalinar forced himself to watch that wave of darkness flow around\nUrithiru’s plateau. Soon it seemed as if their lonely tower were a lighthouse\nlooking over a dark, deadly sea.\nIt was hauntingly silent. Those red lightning bolts didn’t rumble with\nthunder in the proper way. He heard the occasional crack, stark and\nshocking, like a hundred branches snapping at once. But the sounds didn’t\nseem to match the flashes of red light that rose from deep within.\nThe storm was so quiet, in fact, that he was able to hear the telltale rustle\nof cloth as Navani slipped up behind him. She wrapped her arms around\nhim, pressing against his back, resting her head against his shoulder. His\neyes flickered down, and he noticed that she’d removed the glove from her\nsafehand. It was barely visible in the dark: slender, gorgeous fingers—\ndelicate, with the nails painted a blushing red. He saw it by the light of the\nfirst moon above, and by the intermittent flashes of the storm beneath.\n“Any further word from the west?” Dalinar whispered. The Everstorm\nwas slower than a highstorm, and had hit Shinovar many hours before. It\ndid not recharge spheres, even if you left them out during the entire\nEverstorm."

The monarchs are delaying a response, but I\nsuspect that soon they’ll realize they have to listen to us.”\n“I think you underestimate the stubbornness a crown can press into a\nman or woman’s mind, Navani.”\nDalinar had been out during his share of highstorms, particularly in his\nyouth. He’d watched the chaos of the stormwall pushing rocks and refuse\nbefore it, the sky-splitting lightning, the claps of thunder. Highstorms were\nthe ultimate expression of nature’s power: wild, untamed, sent to remind\nman of his insignificance.\nHowever, highstorms never seemed hateful. This storm was different. It\nfelt vengeful.\nStaring into that blackness below, Dalinar thought he could see what it\nhad done. A series of impressions, thrown at him in anger. The storm’s\nexperiences as it had slowly crossed Roshar.\nHouses ripped apart, screams of the occupants lost to the tempest.\nPeople caught in their fields, running in a panic before the unpredicted\nstorm.\nCities blasted with lightning. Towns cast into shadow. Fields swept\nbarren.\nAnd vast seas of glowing red eyes, coming awake like spheres suddenly\nrenewed with Stormlight.\nDalinar hissed out a long, slow breath, the impressions fading. “Was that\nreal?” he whispered.\nYes, the Stormfather said. The enemy rides this storm. He’s aware of you,\nDalinar.\nNot a vision of the past. Not some possibility of the future. His kingdom,\nhis people, his entire world was being attacked. He drew a deep breath. At\nthe very least, this wasn’t the singular tempest that they’d experienced when\nthe Everstorm had clashed with the highstorm for the first time. This\nseemed less powerful. It wouldn’t tear down cities, but it did rain\ndestruction upon them—and the winds would attack in bursts, hostile, even\ndeliberate.\nThe enemy seemed more interested in preying upon the small towns. The\nfields. The people caught unaware.\nThough it was not as destructive as he’d feared, it would still leave\nthousands dead. It would leave cities broken, particularly those without\nshelter to the west. More importantly, it would steal the parshmen laborers\nand turn them into Voidbringers, loosed on the public.\nAll in all, this storm would exact a price in blood from Roshar that\nhadn’t been seen since … well, since the Desolations.\nHe lifted his hand to grasp Navani’s, as she in turn held to him. “You did\nwhat you could, Dalinar,” she whispered after a time watching. “Don’t\ninsist on carrying this failure as a burden.”\n“I won’t.”\nShe released him and turned him around, away from the sight of the\nstorm. She wore a dressing gown, not fit to go about in public, but also not\nprecisely immodest.\nSave for that hand, with which she caressed his chin. “I,” she whispered,\n“don’t believe you, Dalinar Kholin.

I can read the truth in the tightness of\nyour muscles, the set of your jaw. I know that you, while being crushed\nbeneath a boulder, would insist that you’ve got it under control and ask to\nsee field reports from your men.”\nThe scent of her was intoxicating. And those entrancing, brilliant violet\neyes.\n“You need to relax, Dalinar,” she said.\n“Navani…” he said.\nShe looked at him, questioning, so beautiful. Far more gorgeous than\nwhen they’d been young. He’d swear it. For how could anyone be as\nbeautiful as she was now?\nHe seized her by the back of the head and pulled her mouth to his own.\nPassion woke within him. She pressed her body to his, breasts pushing\nagainst him through the thin gown. He drank of her lips, her mouth, her\nscent. Passionspren fluttered around them like crystal flakes of snow.\nDalinar stopped himself and stepped back.\n“Dalinar,” she said as he pulled away. “Your stubborn refusal to get\nseduced is making me question my feminine wiles.”\n“Control is important to me, Navani,” he said, his voice hoarse. He\ngripped the stone balcony wall, white knuckled. “You know how I was,\nwhat I became, when I was a man with no control. I will not surrender\nnow.”\nShe sighed and sidled up to him, pulling his arm free of the stone, then\nslipping under it. “I won’t push you, but I need to know. Is this how it’s\ngoing to continue? Teasing, dancing on the edge?”\n“No,” he said, staring out over the darkness of the storm. “That would be\nan exercise in futility. A general knows not to set himself up for battles he\ncannot win.”\n“Then what?”\n“I’ll find a way to do it right. With oaths.”\nThe oaths were vital. The promise, the act of being bound together.\n“How?” she said, then poked him in the chest. “I’m as religious as the\nnext woman—more than most, actually. But Kadash turned us down, as did\nLadent, even Rushu. She squeaked when I mentioned it and literally ran\naway.”\n“Chanada,” Dalinar said, speaking of the senior ardent of the warcamps.\n“She spoke to Kadash, and had him go to each of the ardents. She probably\ndid it the moment she heard we were courting.”\n“So no ardent will marry us,” Navani said. “They consider us siblings.\nYou’re stretching to find an impossible accommodation; continue with this,\nand it’s going to leave a lady wondering if you actually care.”\n“Have you ever thought that?” Dalinar said. “Sincerely.”\n“Well … no.”\n“You are the woman I love,” Dalinar said, pulling her tight. “A woman I\nhave always loved.”\n“Then who cares?” she said. “Let the ardents hie to Damnation, with\nribbons around their ankles.”\n“Blasphemous.”\n“I’m not the one telling everyone that God is dead.”\n“Not everyone,” Dalinar said.

He sighed, letting go of her—with\nreluctance—and walked back into his rooms, where a brazier of coal\nradiated welcome warmth, as well as the room’s only light. They had\nrecovered his fabrial heating device from the warcamps, but didn’t yet have\nthe Stormlight to run it. The scholars had discovered long chains and cages,\napparently used for lowering spheres down into the storms, so they’d be\nable to renew their spheres—if the highstorms ever returned. In other parts\nof the world, the Weeping had restarted, then fitfully stopped. It might start\nagain. Or the proper storms might start up. Nobody knew, and the\nStormfather refused to enlighten him.\nNavani entered and pulled the thick drapings closed over the doorway,\ntying them tightly in place. This room was heaped with furniture, chairs\nlining the walls, rolled rugs stacked atop them. There was even a standing\nmirror. The images of twisting windspren along its sides bore the distinctly\nrounded look of something that had been carved first from weevilwax, then\nSoulcast into hardwood.\nThey had deposited all this here for him, as if worried about their\nhighprince living in simple stone quarters. “Let’s have someone clear this\nout for me tomorrow,” Dalinar said. “There’s room enough for it in the\nchamber next door, which we can turn into a sitting room or a common\nroom.”\nNavani nodded as she settled onto one of the sofas—he saw her reflected\nin the mirror—her hand still casually uncovered, gown dropping to the side,\nexposing neck, collarbone, and some of what was beneath. She wasn’t\ntrying to be seductive right now; she was merely comfortable around him.\nIntimately familiar, past the point where she felt embarrassed for him to see\nher uncovered.\nIt was good that one of them was willing to take the initiative in the\nrelationship. For all his impatience to advance on the battlefield, this was\none area in which he’d always needed encouragement. Same as it had been\nall those years ago …\n“When I married last,” Dalinar said softly, “I did many things wrong. I\nstarted wrong.”\n“I wouldn’t say that. You married Shshshsh for her Shardplate, but many\nmarriages are for political reasons. That doesn’t mean you were wrong. If\nyou’ll recall, we all encouraged you to do it.”\nAs always, when he heard his dead wife’s name, the word was replaced\nto his hearing with a breezy sound of rushing air—the name couldn’t gain\npurchase in his mind, any more than a man could hold to a gust of wind.\n“I’m not trying to replace her, Dalinar,” Navani said, suddenly sounding\nconcerned. “I know you still have affection for Shshshsh. It’s all right. I can\nshare you with her memory.”\nOh, how little they all understood. He turned toward Navani, set his jaw\nagainst the pain, and said it.\n“I don’t remember her, Navani.”\nShe looked to him with a frown, as if she thought she hadn’t heard him\ncorrectly.\n“I can’t remember my wife at all,” he said. “I don’t know her face."

Her name is taken from me\nwhenever spoken, like someone has plucked it away. I don’t remember what\nshe and I said when we first met; I can’t even remember seeing her at the\nfeast that night when she first arrived. It’s all a blur. I can remember some\nevents surrounding my wife, but nothing of the actual details. It’s all just …\ngone.”\nNavani raised her safehand fingers to her mouth, and from the way her\nbrow knit with concern, he figured he must look like he was in agony.\nHe slumped down in a chair across from her.\n“The alcohol?” she asked softly.\n“Something more.”\nShe breathed out. “The Old Magic. You said you knew both your boon\nand your curse.”\nHe nodded.\n“Oh, Dalinar.”\n“People glance at me when her name comes up,” Dalinar continued,\n“and they give me these looks of pity. They see me keeping a stiff\nexpression, and they assume I’m being stoic. They infer hidden pain, when\nreally I’m just trying to keep up. It’s hard to follow a conversation where\nhalf of it keeps slipping away from your brain.\n“Navani, maybe I did grow to love her. I can’t remember. Not one\nmoment of intimacy, not one fight, not a single word she ever said to me.\nShe’s gone, leaving debris that mars my memory. I can’t remember how she\ndied. That one gets to me, because there are parts of that day I know I\nshould remember. Something about a city in rebellion against my brother,\nand my wife being taken hostage?”\nThat … and a long march alone, accompanied only by hatred and the\nThrill. He remembered those emotions vividly. He’d brought vengeance to\nthose who had taken his wife from him.\nNavani settled down on the seat beside Dalinar, resting her head on his\nshoulder. “Would that I could create a fabrial,” she whispered, “to take\naway this kind of pain.”\n“I think … I think losing her must have hurt me terribly,” Dalinar\nwhispered, “because of what it drove me to do. I am left with only the scars.\nRegardless, Navani, I want it to be right with us. No mistakes. Done\nproperly, with oaths, spoken to you before someone.”\n“Mere words.”\n“Words are the most important things in my life right now.”\nShe parted her lips, thoughtful. “Elhokar?”\n“I wouldn’t want to put him in that position.”\n“A foreign priest? From the Azish, maybe? They’re almost Vorin.”\n“That would be tantamount to declaring myself a heretic. It goes too far.\nI will not defy the Vorin church.” He paused. “I might be willing to sidestep\nit though.…”\n“What?” she asked.\nHe looked upward, toward the ceiling. “Maybe we go to someone with\nauthority greater than theirs.”\n“You want a spren to marry us?” she said, sounding amused. “Using a\nforeign priest would be heretical, but not a spren?”"

I just think it’s a little unusual.”\n“It’s the best we’re going to get, assuming he is willing.” He looked to\nNavani, then raised his eyebrows and shrugged.\n“Is that a proposal?”\n“… Yes?”\n“Dalinar Kholin,” she said. “Surely you can do better.”\nHe rested his hand on the back of her head, touching her black hair,\nwhich she had left loose. “Better than you, Navani? No, I don’t think that I\ncould. I don’t think that any man has ever had a chance better than this.”\nShe smiled, and her only reply was a kiss.\n* * *\nDalinar was surprisingly nervous as, several hours later, he rode one of\nUrithiru’s strange fabrial lifts toward the roof of the tower. The lift\nresembled a balcony, one of many that lined a vast open shaft in the middle\nof Urithiru—a columnar space as wide as a ballroom, which stretched up\nfrom the first floor to the last one.\nThe tiers of the city, despite looking circular from the front, were\nactually more half-circles, with the flat sides facing east. The edges of the\nlower levels melded into the mountains to either side, but the very center\nwas open to the east. The rooms up against that flat side had windows there,\nproviding a view toward the Origin.\nAnd here, in this central shaft, those windows made up one wall. A pure,\nsingle unbroken pane of glass hundreds of feet tall. In the day, that lit the\nshaft with brilliant sunlight. Now, it was dark with the gloom of night.\nThe balcony crawled steadily along a vertical trench in the wall; Adolin\nand Renarin rode with him, along with a few guards and Shallan Davar.\nNavani was already up above. The group stood on the other side of the\nbalcony, giving him space to think. And to be nervous.\nWhy should he be nervous? He could hardly keep his hands from\nshaking. Storms. You’d think he was some silk-covered virgin, not a general\nwell into his middle years.\nHe felt a rumbling deep within him. The Stormfather was being\nresponsive at the moment, for which he was grateful.\n“I’m surprised,” Dalinar whispered to the spren, “you agreed to this so\nwillingly. Grateful, but still surprised.”\nI respect all oaths, the Stormfather responded.\n“What about foolish oaths? Made in haste, or in ignorance?”\nThere are no foolish oaths. All are the mark of men and true spren over\nbeasts and subspren. The mark of intelligence, free will, and choice.\nDalinar chewed on that, and found he was not surprised by the extreme\nopinion. Spren should be extreme; they were forces of nature. But was this\nhow Honor himself, the Almighty, had thought?"

But was this\nhow Honor himself, the Almighty, had thought?\nThe balcony ground its inexorable way toward the top of the tower. Only\na handful of the dozens of lifts worked; back when Urithiru flourished, they\nall would have been going at once. They passed level after level of\nunexplored space, which bothered Dalinar. Making this his fortress was like\ncamping in an unknown land.\nThe lift finally reached the top floor, and his guards scrambled to open\nthe gates. Those were from Bridge Thirteen these days—he’d assigned\nBridge Four to other responsibilities, considering them too important for\nsimple guard duty, now that they were close to becoming Radiants.\nIncreasingly anxious, Dalinar led the way past several pillars designed\nwith representations of the orders of Radiants. A set of steps took him up\nthrough a trapdoor onto the very roof of the tower.\nAlthough each tier was smaller than the one below it, this roof was still\nover a hundred yards wide. It was cold up here, but someone had set up\nbraziers for warmth and torches for light. The night was strikingly clear, and\nhigh above, starspren swirled and made distant patterns.\nDalinar wasn’t sure what to make of the fact that no one—not even his\nsons—had questioned him when he’d announced his intent to marry in the\nmiddle of the night, on the roof of the tower. He searched out Navani, and\nwas shocked to see that she’d found a traditional bridal crown. The intricate\nheaddress of jade and turquoise complemented her wedding gown. Red for\nluck, it was embroidered with gold and shaped in a much looser style than\nthe havah, with wide sleeves and a graceful drape.\nShould Dalinar have found something more traditional to wear himself?\nHe suddenly felt like a dusty, empty frame hung beside the gorgeous\npainting that was Navani in her wedding regalia.\nElhokar stiffly stood at her side wearing a formal golden coat and loose\ntakama underskirt. He was paler than normal, following the failed\nassassination attempt during the Weeping, where he’d nearly bled to death.\nHe’d been resting a great deal lately.\nThough they’d decided to forgo the extravagance of a traditional Alethi\nwedding, they had invited some others. Brightlord Aladar and his daughter,\nSebarial and his mistress. Kalami and Teshav to act as witnesses. He felt\nrelieved to see them there—he’d feared Navani would be unable to find\nwomen willing to notarize the wedding.\nA smattering of Dalinar’s officers and scribes filled out the small\nprocession. At the very back of the crowd gathered between the braziers, he\nspotted a surprising face. Kadash, the ardent, had come as requested. His\nscarred, bearded face didn’t look pleased, but he had come. A good sign.\nPerhaps with everything else happening in the world, a highprince marrying\nhis widowed sister-in-law wouldn’t cause too much of a stir.\nDalinar stepped up to Navani and took her hands, one shrouded in a\nsleeve, the other warm to his touch. “You look amazing,” he said. “How did\nyou find that?”"

This will\nfurther muddy the relationship between us, Dalinar thought, reading the\nsame sentiment on his nephew’s features.\nGavilar would not appreciate how his son had been handled. Despite his\nbest intentions, Dalinar had trodden down the boy and seized power.\nElhokar’s time recuperating had worsened the situation, as Dalinar had\ngrown accustomed to making decisions on his own.\nHowever, Dalinar would be lying to himself if he said that was where it\nhad begun. His actions had been done for the good of Alethkar, for the good\nof Roshar itself, but that didn’t deny the fact that—step by step—he’d\nusurped the throne, despite claiming all along he had no intention of doing\nso.\nDalinar let go of Navani with one hand and rested it on his nephew’s\nshoulder. “I’m sorry, son,” he said.\n“You always are, Uncle,” Elhokar said. “It doesn’t stop you, but I don’t\nsuppose that it should. Your life is defined by deciding what you want, then\nseizing it. The rest of us could learn from that, if only we could figure out\nhow to keep up.”\nDalinar winced. “I have things to discuss with you. Plans that you might\nappreciate. But for tonight, I simply ask your blessing, if you can find it to\ngive.”\n“This will make my mother happy,” Elhokar said. “So, fine.” Elhokar\nkissed his mother on the forehead, then left them, striding across the\nrooftop. At first Dalinar worried the king would stalk down below, but he\nstopped beside one of the more distant braziers, warming his hands.\n“Well,” Navani said. “The only one missing is your spren, Dalinar. If\nhe’s going to—”\nA strong breeze struck the top of the tower, carrying with it the scent of\nrecent rainfall, of wet stone and broken branches. Navani gasped, pulling\nagainst Dalinar.\nA presence emerged in the sky. The Stormfather encompassed\neverything, a face that stretched to both horizons, regarding the men\nimperiously. The air became strangely still, and everything but the tower’s\ntop seemed to fade. It was as if they had slipped into a place outside of time\nitself.\nLighteyes and guards alike murmured or cried out. Even Dalinar, who\nhad been expecting this, found himself taking a step backward—and he had\nto fight the urge to cringe down before the spren.\nOATHS, the Stormfather rumbled, ARE THE SOUL OF RIGHTEOUSNESS. IF YOU\nARE TO SURVIVE THE COMING TEMPEST, OATHS MUST GUIDE YOU.\n“I am comfortable with oaths, Stormfather,” Dalinar called up to him.\n“As you know.”\nYES. THE FIRST IN MILLENNIA TO BIND ME.

I vow it.”\nThe Stormfather seemed content with this, though it was far from a\ntraditional Alethi wedding oath. BONDSMITH? he asked.\n“I swear it likewise,” Dalinar said, holding to her. “Navani Kholin is\nmine, and I am hers. I love her.”\nSO BE IT.\nDalinar had anticipated thunder, lightning, some kind of celestial trump\nof victory. Instead, the timelessness ended. The breeze passed. The\nStormfather vanished. All through the gathered guests, smoky blue\nawespren rings burst out above heads. But not Navani’s. Instead she was\nringed by gloryspren, the golden lights rotating above her head. Nearby,\nSebarial rubbed his temple—as if trying to understand what he’d seen.\nDalinar’s new guards sagged, looking suddenly exhausted.\nAdolin, being Adolin, let out a whoop. He ran over, trailing joyspren in\nthe shape of blue leaves that hurried to keep up with him. He gave Dalinar\n—then Navani—enormous hugs. Renarin followed, more reserved but—\njudging from the wide grin on his face—equally pleased.\nThe next part became a blur, shaking hands, speaking words of thanks.\nInsisting that no gifts were needed, as they’d skipped that part of the\ntraditional ceremony. It seemed that the Stormfather’s pronouncement had\nbeen dramatic enough that everyone accepted it. Even Elhokar, despite his\nearlier pique, gave his mother a hug and Dalinar a clasp on the shoulder\nbefore going below.\nThat left only Kadash. The ardent waited to the end. He stood with hands\nclasped before him as the rooftop emptied.\nTo Dalinar, Kadash had always looked wrong in those robes. Though he\nwore the traditional squared beard, it was not an ardent that Dalinar saw. It\nwas a soldier, with a lean build, dangerous posture, and keen light violet\neyes. He had a twisting old scar running up to and around the top of his\nshaved head. Kadash’s life might now be one of peace and service, but his\nyouth had been spent at war.\nDalinar whispered a few words of promise to Navani, and she left him to\ngo to the level below, where she’d ordered food and wine to be set up.\nDalinar stepped over to Kadash, confident. The pleasure of having finally\ndone what he’d postponed for so long surged through him. He was married\nto Navani. This was a joy that he’d assumed lost to him since his youth, an\noutcome he hadn’t even allowed himself to dream would be his.\nHe would not apologize for it, or for her.\n“Brightlord,” Kadash said quietly."

The ardentia will not be pleased.”\n“Surely they cannot deny my marriage if the Stormfather himself blessed\nthe union.”\n“A spren? You expect us to accept the authority of a spren?”\n“A remnant of the Almighty.”\n“Dalinar, that’s blasphemy,” Kadash said, voice pained.\n“Kadash. You know I’m no heretic. You’ve fought by my side.”\n“That’s supposed to reassure me? Memories of what we did together,\nDalinar? I appreciate the man you have become; you should avoid\nreminding me of the man you once were.”\nDalinar paused, and a memory swirled up from the depths inside him—\none he hadn’t thought of in years. One that surprised him. Where had it\ncome from?\nHe remembered Kadash, bloodied, kneeling on the ground having\nretched until his stomach was empty. A hardened soldier who had\nencountered something so vile that even he was shaken.\nHe’d left to become an ardent the next day.\n“The Rift,” Dalinar whispered. “Rathalas.”\n“Dark times need not be dredged up,” Kadash said. “This isn’t about …\nthat day, Dalinar. It’s about today, and what you’ve been spreading among\nthe scribes. Talk of these things you’ve seen in visions.”\n“Holy messages,” Dalinar said, feeling cold. “Sent by the Almighty.”\n“Holy messages claiming the Almighty is dead?” Kadash said. “Arriving\non the eve of the return of the Voidbringers? Dalinar, can’t you see how this\nlooks? I’m your ardent, technically your slave. And yes, perhaps still your\nfriend. I’ve tried to explain to the councils in Kharbranth and Jah Keved\nthat you mean well. I tell the ardents of the Holy Enclave that you’re\nlooking back toward when the Knights Radiant were pure, rather than their\neventual corruption. I tell them that you have no control over these visions.\n“But Dalinar, that was before you started teaching that the Almighty was\ndead. They’re angry enough over that, and now you’ve gone and defied\nconvention, spitting in the eyes of the ardents! I personally don’t think it\nmatters if you marry Navani. That prohibition is outdated to be sure. But\nwhat you’ve done tonight…”\nDalinar reached to place a hand on Kadash’s shoulder, but the man\npulled away.\n“Old friend,” Dalinar said softly, “Honor might be dead, but I have\nfelt … something else. Something beyond. A warmth and a light. It is not\nthat God has died, it is that the Almighty was never God. He did his best to\nguide us, but he was an impostor. Or perhaps only an agent. A being not\nunlike a spren—he had the power of a god, but not the pedigree.”\nKadash looked at him, eyes widening. “Please, Dalinar. Don’t ever\nrepeat what you just said. I think I can explain away what happened tonight."

But you don’t seem to realize you’re aboard a ship barely afloat in a\nstorm, while you insist on doing a jig on the prow!”\n“I will not hold back truth if I find it, Kadash,” Dalinar said. “You just\nsaw that I am literally bound to a spren of oaths. I don’t dare lie.”\n“I don’t think you would lie, Dalinar,” Kadash said. “But I do think you\ncan make mistakes. Do not forget that I was there. You are not infallible.”\nThere? Dalinar thought as Kadash backed up, bowed, then turned and\nleft. What does he remember that I cannot?\nDalinar watched him go. Finally, he shook his head, and went to join the\nmidnight feast, intent on being done with it as soon as was seemly. He\nneeded time with Navani.\nHis wife.\n5. Hearthstone\nI can point to the moment when I decided for certain this record had to\nbe written. I hung between realms, seeing into Shadesmar—the realm\nof the spren—and beyond.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nKaladin trudged through a field of quiet rockbuds, fully aware that he was\ntoo late to prevent a disaster. His failure pressed down on him with an\nalmost physical sensation, like the weight of a bridge he was forced to carry\nall on his own.\nAfter so long in the eastern part of the stormlands, he had nearly\nforgotten the sights of a fertile landscape. Rockbuds here grew almost as\nbig as barrels, with vines as thick as his wrist spilling out and lapping water\nfrom the pools on the stone. Fields of vibrant green grass pulled back into\nburrows before him, easily three feet tall when standing at height. The field\nwas dappled with glowing lifespren, like motes of green dust.\nThe grass back near the Shattered Plains had barely reached as high as\nhis ankle, and had mostly grown in yellowish patches on the leeward side of\nhills. He was surprised to find that he distrusted this taller, fuller grass. An\nambusher could hide in that, by crouching down and waiting for the grass to\nrise back up. How had Kaladin never noticed? He’d run through fields like\nthis playing catch-me with his brother, trying to see who was quick enough\nto grab handfuls of grass before it hid.\nKaladin felt drained. Used up. Four days ago, he’d traveled by Oathgate\nto the Shattered Plains, then flown to the northwest at speed. Filled to\nbursting with Stormlight—and carrying a wealth more in gemstones—he’d\nbeen determined to reach his home, Hearthstone, before the Everstorm\nreturned.\nAfter just half a day, he’d run out of Stormlight somewhere in Aladar’s\nprincedom. He’d been walking ever since. Perhaps he could have flown all\nthe way to Hearthstone if he’d been more practiced with his powers. As it\nwas, he’d traveled over a thousand miles in half a day, but this last bit—\nninety or so miles—had taken an excruciating three days.\nHe hadn’t beaten the Everstorm.

        "text": "ninety or so miles—had taken an excruciating three days.\nHe hadn’t beaten the Everstorm. It had arrived earlier in the day, around\nnoon.\nKaladin noticed a bit of debris peeking out of the grass, and he trudged\ntoward it. The foliage obligingly pulled back before him, revealing a broken\nwooden churn, the kind used for turning sow’s milk into butter. Kaladin\ncrouched and rested fingers on the splintered wood, then glanced toward\nanother chunk of wood peeking out over the tops of the grass.\nSyl zipped down as a ribbon of light, passing his head and spinning\naround the length of wood.\n“It’s the edge of a roof,” Kaladin said. “The lip that hangs down on the\nleeward side of a building.” Probably from a storage shed, judging by the\nother debris.\nAlethkar wasn’t in the harshest of the stormlands, but neither was this\nsome soft-skinned Western land. Buildings here were built low and squat,\nsturdy sides pointed eastward toward the Origin, like the shoulder of a man\nset and ready to take the force of an impact. Windows would only be on the\nleeward—the westward—side. Like the grass and the trees, humankind had\nlearned to weather the storms.\nThat depended on storms always blowing in the same direction. Kaladin\nhad done what he could to prepare the villages and towns he passed for the\ncoming Everstorm, which would blow in the wrong direction and transform\nparshmen into destructive Voidbringers. Nobody in those towns had\npossessed working spanreeds, however, and he’d been unable to contact his\nhome.\nHe hadn’t been fast enough. Earlier today, he’d spent the Everstorm\nwithin a tomb he’d hollowed out of rock using his Shardblade—Syl herself,\nwho could manifest as any weapon he desired. In truth, the storm hadn’t\nbeen nearly as bad as the one where he’d fought the Assassin in White. But\nthe debris he found here proved that this one had been bad enough.\nThe mere memory of that red storm outside his hollow made panic rise\ninside him. The Everstorm was so wrong, so unnatural—like a baby born\nwith no face. Some things just should not be.\nHe stood up and continued on his way. He had changed uniforms before\nleaving—his old uniform had been bloodied and tattered. He now wore a\nspare generic Kholin uniform. It felt wrong not to bear the symbol of Bridge\nFour.\nHe crested a hill and spotted a river to his right. Trees sprouted along its\nbanks, hungry for the extra water. That would be Hobble’s Brook. So if he\nlooked directly west …\nHand shading his eyes, he could see hills that had been stripped of grass\nand rockbuds. They’d soon be slathered with seed-crem, and lavis polyps\nwould start to bud. That hadn’t started yet; this was supposed to be the\nWeeping. Rain should be falling right now in a constant, gentle shower.\nSyl zipped up in front of him, a ribbon of light. “Your eyes are brown\nagain,” she noted.\nIt took a few hours without summoning his Shardblade.

Syl found the\nvariation fascinating; Kaladin still hadn’t decided how he felt about it.\n“We’re close,” Kaladin said, pointing. “Those fields belong to\nHobbleken. We’re maybe two hours from Hearthstone.”\n“Then you’ll be home!” Syl said, her ribbon of light spiraling and taking\nthe shape of a young woman in a flowing havah, tight and buttoning above\nthe waist, with safehand covered.\nKaladin grunted, walking down the slope, longing for Stormlight. Being\nwithout it now, after holding so much, was an echoing hollowness within\nhim. Was this what it would be like every time he ran dry?\nThe Everstorm hadn’t recharged his spheres, of course. Neither with\nStormlight nor some other energy, which he’d feared might happen.\n“Do you like the new dress?” Syl asked, wagging her covered safehand\nas she stood in the air.\n“Looks strange on you.”\n“I’ll have you know I put a ton of thought into it. I spent positively hours\nthinking of just how— Oh! What’s that?”\nShe turned into a little stormcloud that shot toward a lurg clinging to a\nstone. She inspected the fist-size amphibian on one side, then the other,\nbefore squealing in joy and turning into a perfect imitation of the thing—\nexcept pale white-blue. This startled the creature away, and she giggled,\nzipping back toward Kaladin as a ribbon of light.\n“What were we saying?” she asked, forming into a young woman and\nresting on his shoulder.\n“Nothing important.”\n“I’m sure I was scolding you. Oh, yes, you’re home! Yay! Aren’t you\nexcited?”\nShe didn’t see it—didn’t realize. Sometimes, for all her curiosity, she\ncould be oblivious.\n“But … it’s your home…” Syl said. She huddled down. “What’s\nwrong?”\n“The Everstorm, Syl,” Kaladin said. “We were supposed to beat it here.”\nHe’d needed to beat it here.\nSurely someone would have survived, right? The fury of the storm, and\nthen the worse fury after? The murderous rampage of servants turned into\nmonsters?\nOh, Stormfather. Why hadn’t he been faster?\nHe forced himself into a double march again, pack slung over his\nshoulder. The weight was still heavy, dreadfully so, but he found that he had\nto know. Had to see.\nSomeone had to witness what had happened to his home.\n* * *\nThe rain resumed about an hour out of Hearthstone, so at least the weather\npatterns hadn’t been completely ruined. Unfortunately, this meant he had to\nhike the rest of the way wet. He splashed through puddles where rainspren\ngrew, blue candles with eyes on the very tip.\n“It will be all right, Kaladin,” Syl promised from his shoulder.

He braced himself for the destruction, but it\nshocked him nonetheless. Some of the buildings he remembered were\nsimply … gone. Others stood without roofs. He couldn’t see the entire town\nfrom his vantage, not in the gloom of the Weeping, but many of the\nstructures he could make out were hollow and ruined.\nHe stood for a long time as night fell. He didn’t spot a glimmer of light\nin the town. It was empty.\nDead.\nA part of him scrunched up inside, huddling into a corner, tired of being\nwhipped so often. He’d embraced his power; he’d taken the path of a\nRadiant. Why hadn’t it been enough?\nHis eyes immediately sought out his own home on the outskirts of town.\nBut no. Even if he’d been able to see it in the rainy evening gloom, he\ndidn’t want to go there. Not yet. He couldn’t face the death he might find.\nInstead, he rounded Hearthstone on the northwestern side, where a hill\nled up to the citylord’s manor. The larger rural towns like this served as a\nkind of hub for the small farming communities around them. Because of\nthat, Hearthstone was cursed with the presence of a lighteyed ruler of some\nstatus. Brightlord Roshone, a man whose greedy ways had ruined far more\nthan one life.\nMoash … Kaladin thought as he trudged up the hill toward the manor,\nshivering in the chill and the darkness. He’d have to face his friend’s\nbetrayal—and near assassination of Elhokar—at some point. For now, he\nhad more pressing wounds that needed tending.\nThe manor was where the town’s parshmen had been kept; they’d have\nbegun their rampage here. He was pretty sure that if he ran across\nRoshone’s broken corpse, he wouldn’t be too heartbroken.\n“Wow,” Syl said. “Gloomspren.”\nKaladin looked up and noted an unusual spren whipping about. Long,\ngrey, like a tattered streamer of cloth in the wind. It wound around him,\nfluttering. He’d seen its like only once or twice before.\n“Why are they so rare?” Kaladin asked. “People feel gloomy all the\ntime.”\n“Who knows?” Syl said. “Some spren are common. Some are\nuncommon.” She tapped his shoulder. “I’m pretty sure one of my aunts\nliked to hunt these things.”\n“Hunt them?” Kaladin asked. “Like, try to spot them?”\n“No. Like you hunt greatshells. Can’t remember her name…” Syl\ncocked her head, oblivious to the fact that rain was falling through her form.\n“She wasn’t really my aunt. Just an honorspren I referred to that way. What\nan odd memory.”\n“More seems to be coming back to you.”\n“The longer I’m with you, the more it happens. Assuming you don’t try\nto kill me again.” She gave him a sideways look. Though it was dark, she\nglowed enough for him to make out the expression."

Though it was dark, she\nglowed enough for him to make out the expression.\n“How often are you going to make me apologize for that?”\n“How many times have I done it so far?”\n“At least fifty.”\n“Liar,” Syl said. “Can’t be more than twenty.”\n“I’m sorry.”\nWait. Was that light up ahead?\nKaladin stopped on the path. It was light, coming from the manor house.\nIt flickered unevenly. Fire? Was the manor burning? No, it seemed to be\ncandles or lanterns inside. Someone, it appeared, had survived. Humans or\nVoidbringers?\nHe needed to be careful, though as he approached, he found that he\ndidn’t want to be. He wanted to be reckless, angry, destructive. If he found\nthe creatures that had taken his home from him …\n“Be ready,” he mumbled to Syl.\nHe stepped off the pathway, which was kept free of rockbuds and other\nplants, and crept carefully toward the manor. Light shone between boards\nthat had been pounded across the building’s windows, replacing glass that\nthe Everstorm undoubtedly broke. He was surprised the manor had survived\nas well as it had. The porch had been ripped free, but the roof remained.\nThe rain masked other sounds and made it difficult to see much beyond\nthat, but someone, or something, was inside. Shadows moved in front of the\nlights.\nHeart pounding, Kaladin rounded toward the northern side of the\nbuilding. The servants’ entrance would be here, along with the quarters for\nthe parshmen. An unusual amount of noise came from inside the manor\nhouse. Thumping. Motion. Like a nest full of rats.\nHe had to feel his way through the gardens. The parshmen had been\nhoused in a small structure built in the manor’s shadow, with a single open\nchamber and benches for sleeping. Kaladin reached it by touch and felt at a\nlarge hole ripped in the side.\nScraping came from behind him.\nKaladin spun as the back door of the manor opened, its warped frame\ngrinding against stone. He dove for cover behind a shalebark mound, but\nlight bathed him, cutting through the rain. A lantern.\nKaladin stretched his hand to the side, prepared to summon Syl, yet the\nperson who stepped from the manor was no Voidbringer, but instead a\nhuman guardsman in an old helm spotted by rust.\nThe man held up his lantern. “Here now,” he shouted at Kaladin,\nfumbling at the mace on his belt. “Here now! You there!” He pulled free the\nweapon and held it out in a quivering hand. “What are you? Deserter?\nCome here into the light and let me see you.”\nKaladin stood up warily. He didn’t recognize the soldier—but either\nsomeone had survived the Voidbringer assault, or this man was part of an\nexpedition investigating the aftermath. Either way, it was the first hopeful\nsign Kaladin had seen since arriving.\nHe held his hands up—he was unarmed save for Syl—and let the guard\nbully him into the building.\n6. Four Lifetimes"

Four Lifetimes\nI thought that I was surely dead. Certainly, some who saw farther than\nI did thought I had fallen.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nKaladin stepped into Roshone’s manor, and his apocalyptic visions of death\nand loss started to fade as he recognized people. He passed Toravi, one of\nthe town’s many farmers, in the hallway. Kaladin remembered the man as\nbeing enormous, with thick shoulders. In actuality, he was shorter than\nKaladin by half a hand, and most of Bridge Four could have outmatched\nhim for muscles.\nToravi didn’t seem to recognize Kaladin. The man stepped into a side\nchamber, which was packed with darkeyes sitting on the floor.\nThe soldier walked Kaladin along the candlelit hallway. They passed\nthrough the kitchens, and Kaladin noted dozens of other familiar faces. The\ntownspeople filled the manor, packing every room. Most sat on the floor in\nfamily groups, and while they looked tired and disheveled, they were alive.\nHad they rebuffed the Voidbringer assault, then?\nMy parents, Kaladin thought, pushing through a small group of\ntownspeople and moving more quickly. Where were his parents?\n“Whoa, there!” said the soldier behind, grabbing Kaladin by the\nshoulder. He shoved his mace into the small of Kaladin’s back. “Don’t\nmake me down you, son.”\nKaladin turned on the guardsman, a clean-shaven fellow with brown\neyes that seemed set a little too close together. That rusted cap was a\ndisgrace.\n“Now,” the soldier said, “we’re just going to go find Brightlord Roshone,\nand you’re going to explain why you were skulking round the place. Act\nreal nice, and maybe he won’t hang you. Understand?”\nThe townspeople in the kitchens noticed Kaladin finally, and pulled\naway. Many whispered to one another, eyes wide, fearful. He heard the\nwords “deserter,” “slave brands,” “dangerous.”\nNobody said his name.\n“They don’t recognize you?” Syl asked as she walked across a kitchen\ncountertop.\nWhy would they recognize this man he had become? Kaladin saw\nhimself reflected in a pan hanging beside the brick oven. Long hair with a\ncurl to it, the tips resting against his shoulders. A rough uniform that was a\nshade too small for him, face bearing a scruffy beard from several weeks\nwithout shaving. Soaked and exhausted, he looked like a vagabond.\nThis wasn’t the homecoming he’d imagined during his first months at\nwar. A glorious reunion where he returned as a hero wearing the knots of a\nsergeant, his brother delivered safe to his family. In his fancies, people had\npraised him, slapped him on the back and accepted him.\nIdiocy. These people had never treated him or his family with any\nmeasure of kindness.\n“Let’s go,” the soldier said, shoving him on the shoulder.\nKaladin didn’t move.

When the man shoved harder, Kaladin rolled his\nbody with the push, and the shift of weight sent the guard stumbling past\nhim. The man turned, angry. Kaladin met his gaze. The guard hesitated,\nthen took a step back and gripped his mace more firmly.\n“Wow,” Syl said, zipping up to Kaladin’s shoulder. “That is quite the\nglare you gave.”\n“Old sergeant’s trick,” Kaladin whispered, turning and leaving the\nkitchens. The guard followed behind, barking an order that Kaladin ignored.\nEach step through this manor was like walking through a memory. There\nwas the dining nook where he’d confronted Rillir and Laral on the night\nhe’d discovered his father was a thief. This hallway beyond, hung with\nportraits of people he didn’t know, had been where he’d played as a child.\nRoshone hadn’t changed the portraits.\nHe’d have to talk to his parents about Tien. It was why he hadn’t tried to\ncontact them after being freed from slavery. Could he face them? Storms, he\nhoped they lived. But could he face them?\nHe heard a moan. Soft, underneath the sounds of people talking, still he\npicked it out.\n“There were wounded?” he asked, turning on his guard.\n“Yeah,” the man said. “But—”\nKaladin ignored him and strode down the hallway, Syl flying along\nbeside his head. Kaladin shoved past people, following the sounds of the\ntormented, and eventually stumbled into the doorway of the parlor. It had\nbeen transformed into a surgeon’s triage room, with mats laid out on the\nfloor bearing wounded.\nA figure knelt by one of the pallets carefully splinting a broken arm.\nKaladin had known as soon as he’d heard those moans of pain where he’d\nfind his father.\nLirin glanced at him. Storms. Kaladin’s father looked weathered, bags\nunderneath his dark brown eyes. The hair was greyer than Kaladin\nremembered, the face gaunter. But he was the same. Balding, diminutive,\nthin, bespectacled … and amazing.\n“What’s this?” Lirin asked, turning back to his work. “Did the\nhighprince’s house send soldiers already? That was faster than expected.\nHow many did you bring? We can certainly use…” Lirin hesitated, then\nlooked back at Kaladin.\nThen his eyes opened wide.\n“Hello, Father,” Kaladin said.\nThe guardsman finally caught up, shouldering past gawking townspeople\nand waving his mace toward Kaladin like a baton. Kaladin sidestepped\nabsently, then pushed the man so he stumbled farther down the hallway.\n“It is you,” Lirin said. Then he scrambled over and caught Kaladin in an\nembrace. “Oh, Kal. My boy. My little boy. Hesina! HESINA!”\nKaladin’s mother appeared in the doorway a moment later, bearing a tray\nof freshly boiled bandages. She probably thought that Lirin needed her help\nwith a patient. Taller than her husband by a few fingers, she wore her hair\ntied back with a kerchief just as Kaladin remembered."

Shockspren, like\npale yellow triangles breaking and re-forming, appeared behind her. She\ndropped the tray and reached to the side of Kaladin’s face with a soft touch.\nSyl zipped around in a ribbon of light, laughing.\nKaladin couldn’t laugh. Not until it had been said. He took a deep breath,\nchoked on it the first time, then finally forced it out.\n“I’m sorry, Father, Mother,” he whispered. “I joined the army to protect\nhim, but I could barely protect myself.” He found himself shaking, and he\nput his back to the wall, letting himself sink down until he was seated. “I let\nTien die. I’m sorry. It’s my fault.…”\n“Oh, Kaladin,” Hesina said, kneeling down beside him and pulling him\ninto an embrace. “We got your letter, but over a year ago they told us you\nhad died as well.”\n“I should have saved him,” Kaladin whispered.\n“You shouldn’t have gone in the first place,” Lirin said. “But now …\nAlmighty, now you’re back.” Lirin stood up, tears leaking down his cheeks.\n“My son! My son is alive!”\n* * *\nA short time later, Kaladin sat among the wounded, holding a cup of warm\nsoup in his hands. He hadn’t had a hot meal since … when?\n“That’s obviously a slave’s brand, Lirin,” a soldier said, speaking with\nKaladin’s father near the doorway into the room. “Sas glyph, so it happened\nhere in the princedom. They probably told you he’d died to save you the\nshame of the truth. And then the shash brand—you don’t get that for mere\ninsubordination.”\nKaladin sipped his soup. His mother knelt beside him, one hand on his\nshoulder, protective. The soup tasted of home. Boiled vegetable broth with\nsteamed lavis stirred in, spiced as his mother always made it.\nHe hadn’t spoken much in the half hour since he’d arrived. For now, he\njust wanted to be here with them.\nStrangely, his memories had turned fond. He remembered Tien laughing,\nbrightening the dreariest of days. He remembered hours spent studying\nmedicine with his father, or cleaning with his mother.\nSyl hovered before his mother, still wearing her little havah, invisible to\neveryone but Kaladin. The spren had a perplexed look on her face.\n“The wrong-way highstorm did break many of the town’s buildings,”\nHesina explained to him softly. “But our home still stands. We had to\ndedicate your spot to something else, Kal, but we can make space for you.”\nKaladin glanced at the soldier. Captain of Roshone’s guard; Kaladin\nthought he remembered the man.

Roshone won’t go making a\nstorm and risk Lirin’s discontent—and you won’t be taken from us again.”\nShe talked to him as if he were a child.\nWhat a surreal sensation, being back here, being treated like he was still\nthe boy who had left for war five years ago. Three men bearing their son’s\nname had lived and died in that time. The soldier who had been forged in\nAmaram’s army. The slave, so bitter and angry. His parents had never met\nCaptain Kaladin, bodyguard to the most powerful man in Roshar.\nAnd then … there was the next man, the man he was becoming. A man\nwho owned the skies and spoke ancient oaths. Five years had passed. And\nfour lifetimes.\n“He’s a runaway slave,” the guard captain hissed. “We can’t just ignore\nthat, surgeon. He probably stole the uniform. And even if for some reason\nhe was allowed to hold a spear despite his brands, he’s a deserter. Look at\nthose haunted eyes and tell me you don’t see a man who has done terrible\nthings.”\n“He’s my son,” Lirin said. “I’ll buy his writ of slavery. You’re not taking\nhim. Tell Roshone he can either let this slide, or he can go without a\nsurgeon. Unless he assumes Mara can take over after just a few years of\napprenticeship.”\nDid they think they were speaking softly enough that he couldn’t hear?\nLook at the wounded people in this room, Kaladin. You’re missing\nsomething.\nThe wounded … they displayed fractures. Concussions. Very few\nlacerations. This was not the aftermath of a battle, but of a natural disaster.\nSo what had happened to the Voidbringers? Who had fought them off?\n“Things have gotten better since you left,” Hesina promised Kaladin,\nsqueezing his shoulder. “Roshone isn’t as bad as he once was. I think he\nfeels guilty. We can rebuild, be a family again. And there’s something else\nyou need to know about. We—”\n“Hesina,” Lirin said, throwing his hands into the air.\n“Yes?”\n“Write a letter to the highprince’s administrators,” Lirin said. “Explain\nthe situation; see if we can get a forbearance, or at least an explanation.” He\nlooked to the soldier. “Will that satisfy your master? We can wait upon a\nhigher authority, and in the meantime I can have my son back.”\n“We’ll see,” the soldier said, folding his arms. “I’m not sure how much I\nlike the idea of a shash-branded man running around my town.”\nHesina rose to join Lirin. The two had a hushed exchange as the guard\nsettled back against the doorway, pointedly keeping an eye on Kaladin. Did\nhe know how little like a soldier he looked? He didn’t walk like a man\nacquainted with battle. He stepped too hard, and stood with his knees too"

There were no dents in his breastplate, and his sword’s scabbard\nknocked against things as he turned.\nKaladin sipped his soup. Was it any wonder that his parents still thought\nof him as a child? He’d come in looking ragged and abandoned, then had\nstarted sobbing about Tien’s death. Being home brought out the child in\nhim, it seemed.\nPerhaps it was time, for once, to stop letting the rain dictate his mood.\nHe couldn’t banish the seed of darkness inside him, but Stormfather, he\ndidn’t need to let it rule him either.\nSyl walked up to him in the air. “They’re like I remember them.”\n“Remember them?” Kaladin whispered. “Syl, you never knew me when\nI lived here.”\n“That’s true,” she said.\n“So how can you remember them?” Kaladin said, frowning.\n“Because I do,” Syl said, flitting around him. “Everyone is connected,\nKaladin. Everything is connected. I didn’t know you then, but the winds\ndid, and I am of the winds.”\n“You’re honorspren.”\n“The winds are of Honor,” she said, laughing as if he’d said something\nridiculous. “We are kindred blood.”\n“You don’t have blood.”\n“And you don’t have an imagination, it appears.” She landed in the air\nbefore him and became a young woman. “Besides, there was … another\nvoice. Pure, with a song like tapped crystal, distant yet demanding…” She\nsmiled, and zipped away.\nWell, the world might have been upended, but Syl was as impenetrable\nas ever. Kaladin set aside his soup and climbed to his feet. He stretched to\none side, then the other, feeling satisfying pops from his joints. He walked\ntoward his parents. Storms, but everyone in this town seemed smaller than\nhe remembered. He hadn’t been that much shorter when he’d left\nHearthstone, had he?\nA figure stood right outside the room, speaking with the guard with the\nrusty helmet. Roshone wore a lighteyes’ coat that was several seasons out of\nfashion—Adolin would have shaken his head at that. The citylord wore a\nwooden foot on his right leg, and had lost weight since Kaladin had last\nseen him. His skin drooped on his figure like melted wax, bunching up at\nhis neck.\nThat said, Roshone had the same imperious bearing, the same angry\nexpression—his light yellow eyes seemed to blame everyone and\neverything in this insignificant town for his banishment. He’d once lived in\nKholinar, but had been involved in the deaths of some citizens—Moash’s\ngrandparents—and had been shipped out here as punishment.\nHe turned toward Kaladin, lit by candles on the walls. “So, you’re alive.\nThey didn’t teach you to keep yourself in the army, I see. Let me have a\nlook at those brands of yours.” He reached over and held up the hair in front\nof Kaladin’s forehead. “Storms, boy. What did you do? Hit a lighteyes?”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said.\nThen punched him."

A solid hit, exactly like Hav had\ntaught him. Thumb outside of his fist, he connected with the first two\nknuckles of his hand across Roshone’s cheekbone, then followed through to\nslide across the front of the face. Rarely had he delivered such a perfect\npunch. It barely even hurt his fist.\nRoshone dropped like a felled tree.\n“That,” Kaladin said, “was for my friend Moash.”\n7. A Watcher at the Rim\nI did not die.\nI experienced something worse.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\n“Kaladin!” Lirin exclaimed, grabbing him by the shoulder. “What are you\ndoing, son?”\nRoshone sputtered on the ground, his nose bleeding. “Guards, take him!\nYou hear me!”\nSyl landed on Kaladin’s shoulder, hands on her hips. She tapped her foot.\n“He probably deserved that.”\nThe darkeyed guard scrambled to help Roshone to his feet while the\ncaptain leveled his sword at Kaladin. A third joined them, running in from\nanother room.\nKaladin stepped one foot back, falling into a guard position.\n“Well?” Roshone demanded, holding his handkerchief to his nose.\n“Strike him down!” Angerspren boiled up from the ground in pools.\n“Please, no,” Kaladin’s mother cried, clinging to Lirin. “He’s just\ndistraught. He—”\nKaladin held out a hand toward her, palm forward, in a quieting motion.\n“It’s all right, Mother. That was only payment for a little unsettled debt\nbetween Roshone and me.”\nHe met the eyes of the guards, each in turn, and they shuffled\nuncertainly. Roshone blustered. Unexpectedly, Kaladin felt in complete\ncontrol of the situation—and … well, more than a little embarrassed.\nSuddenly, the perspective of it crashed down on him. Since leaving\nHearthstone, Kaladin had met true evil, and Roshone hardly compared.\nHadn’t he sworn to protect even those he didn’t like? Wasn’t the whole\npoint of what he had learned to keep him from doing things like this? He\nglanced at Syl, and she nodded to him.\nDo better.\nFor a short time, it had been nice to just be Kal again. Fortunately, he\nwasn’t that youth any longer. He was a new person—and for the first time\nin a long, long while, he was happy with that person.\n“Stand down, men,” Kaladin said to the soldiers. “I promise not to hit\nyour brightlord again. I apologize for that; I was momentarily distracted by\nour previous history. Something he and I both need to forget. Tell me, what\nhappened to the parshmen? Did they not attack the town?”\nThe soldiers shifted, glancing toward Roshone.\n“I said stand down,” Kaladin snapped. “For storm’s sake, man.

I know Amaram recruited most of the able-bodied men in the\nregion, but I’ve seen messenger boys with more battle poise than you.”\nThe soldiers looked to one another. Then, red-faced, the lighteyed one\nslid his sword back into its sheath.\n“What are you doing?” Roshone demanded. “Attack him!”\n“Brightlord, sir,” the man said, eyes down. “I may not be the best soldier\naround, but … well, sir, trust me on this. We should just pretend that punch\nnever happened.” The other two soldiers nodded their heads in agreement.\nRoshone sized Kaladin up, dabbing at his nose, which wasn’t bleeding\nbadly. “So, they did make something out of you in the army, did they?”\n“You have no idea. We need to talk. Is there a room here that isn’t\nclogged full of people?”\n“Kal,” Lirin said. “You’re speaking foolishness. Don’t give orders to\nBrightlord Roshone!”\nKaladin pushed past the soldiers and Roshone, walking farther down the\nhallway. “Well?” he barked. “Empty room?”\n“Up the stairs, sir,” one of the soldiers said. “Library is empty.”\n“Excellent.” Kaladin smiled to himself, noting the “sir.” “Join me up\nthere, men.”\nKaladin started toward the stairs. Unfortunately, an authoritative bearing\ncould only take a man so far. Nobody followed, not even his parents.\n“I gave you people an order,” Kaladin said. “I’m not fond of repeating\nmyself.”\n“And what,” Roshone said, “makes you think you can order anyone\naround, boy?”\nKaladin turned back and swept his arm before him, summoning Syl. A\nbright, dew-covered Shardblade formed from mist into his hand. He spun\nthe Blade and rammed her down into the floor in one smooth motion. He\nheld the grip, feeling his eyes bleed to blue.\nEverything grew still. Townspeople froze, gaping. Roshone’s eyes\nbulged. Curiously, Kaladin’s father just lowered his head and closed his\neyes.\n“Any other questions?” Kaladin asked.\n* * *\n“They were gone when we went back to check on them, um, Brightlord,”\nsaid Aric, the short guard with the rusty helm. “We’d locked the door, but\nthe side was ripped clean open.”\n“They didn’t attack a soul?” Kaladin asked.\n“No, Brightlord.”\nKaladin paced through the library. The room was small, but neatly\norganized with rows of shelves and a fine reading stand. Each book was\nexactly flush with the others; either the maids were extremely meticulous,\nor the books were not often moved. Syl perched on one shelf, her back to a\nbook, swinging her legs girlishly over the edge.\nRoshone sat on one side of the room, periodically pushing both hands\nalong his flushed cheeks toward the back of his head in an odd nervous\ngesture. His nose had stopped bleeding, though he’d have a nice bruise.\nThat was a fraction of the punishment the man deserved, but Kaladin found\nhe had no passion for abusing Roshone. He had to be better than that."

He had to be better than that.\n“What did the parshmen look like?” Kaladin asked of the guardsmen.\n“They changed, following the unusual storm?”\n“Sure did,” Aric said. “I peeked when I heard them break out, after the\nstorm passed. They looked like Voidbringers, I tell you, with big bony bits\njutting from their skin.”\n“They were taller,” the guard captain added. “Taller than me, easily as\ntall as you are, Brightlord. With legs thick as stumpweights and hands that\ncould have strangled a whitespine, I tell you.”\n“Then why didn’t they attack?” Kaladin asked. They could have easily\ntaken the manor; instead, they’d run off into the night. It spoke of a more\ndisturbing goal. Perhaps Hearthstone was too small to be bothered with.\n“I don’t suppose you tracked their direction?” Kaladin said, looking\ntoward the guards, then Roshone.\n“Um, no, Brightlord,” the captain said. “Honestly, we were just worried\nabout surviving.”\n“Will you tell the king?” Aric asked. “That storm ripped away four of\nour silos. We’ll be starving afore too long, with all these refugees and no\nfood. When the highstorms start coming again, we won’t have half as many\nhomes as we need.”\n“I’ll tell Elhokar.” But Stormfather, the rest of the kingdom would be just\nas bad.\nHe needed to focus on the Voidbringers. He couldn’t report back to\nDalinar until he had the Stormlight to fly home, so for now it seemed his\nmost useful task would be to find out where the enemy was gathering, if he\ncould. What were the Voidbringers planning? Kaladin hadn’t experienced\ntheir strange powers himself, though he’d heard reports of the Battle of\nNarak. Parshendi with glowing eyes and lightning at their command,\nruthless and terrible.\n“I’ll need maps,” he said. “Maps of Alethkar, as detailed as you have,\nand some way to carry them through the rain without ruining them.” He\ngrimaced. “And a horse. Several of them, the finest you have.”\n“So you’re robbing me now?” Roshone asked softly, staring at the floor.\n“Robbing?” Kaladin said. “We’ll call it renting instead.” He pulled a\nhandful of spheres from his pocket and dropped them on the table. He\nglanced toward the soldiers. “Well? Maps? Surely Roshone keeps survey\nmaps of the nearby areas.”\nRoshone was not important enough to have stewardship over any of the\nhighprince’s lands—a distinction Kaladin had never realized while he lived\nin Hearthstone. Those lands would be watched over by much more\nimportant lighteyes; Roshone would only be a first point of contact with\nsurrounding villages.\n“We’ll want to wait for the lady’s permission,” the guard captain said.\n“Sir.”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow. They’d disobey Roshone for him, but not the\nmanor’s lady? “Go to the house ardents and tell them to prepare the things I\nrequest. Permission will be forthcoming. And locate a spanreed connected"

And locate a spanreed connected\nto Tashikk, if any of the ardents have one. Once I have the Stormlight to use\nit, I’ll want to send word to Dalinar.”\nThe guards saluted and left.\nKaladin folded his arms. “Roshone, I’m going to need to chase those\nparshmen and see if I can figure out what they’re up to. I don’t suppose any\nof your guards have tracking experience? Following the creatures would be\nhard enough without the rain swamping everything.”\n“Why do they matter so much?” Roshone asked, still staring at the floor.\n“Surely you’ve guessed,” Kaladin said, nodding to Syl as her ribbon of\nlight flitted over to his shoulder. “Weather in turmoil and terrors\ntransformed from common servants? That storm with the red lightning,\nblowing the wrong direction? The Desolation is here, Roshone. The\nVoidbringers have returned.”\nRoshone groaned, leaning forward, arms wrapped around himself as if\nhe were going to be sick.\n“Syl?” Kaladin whispered. “I might need you again.”\n“You sound apologetic,” she replied, cocking her head.\n“I am. I don’t like the idea of swinging you about, smashing you into\nthings.”\nShe sniffed. “Firstly, I don’t smash into things. I am an elegant and\ngraceful weapon, stupid. Secondly, why would you be bothered?”\n“It doesn’t feel right,” Kaladin replied, still whispering. “You’re a\nwoman, not a weapon.”\n“Wait … so this is about me being a girl?”\n“No,” Kaladin said immediately, then hesitated. “Maybe. It just feels\nstrange.”\nShe sniffed. “You don’t ask your other weapons how they feel about\nbeing swung about.”\n“My other weapons aren’t people.” He hesitated. “Are they?”\nShe looked at him with head cocked and eyebrows raised, as if he’d said\nsomething very stupid.\nEverything has a spren. His mother had taught him that from an early\nage.\n“So … some of my spears have been women, then?” he asked.\n“Female, at least,” Syl said. “Roughly half, as these things tend to go.”\nShe flitted up into the air in front of him. “It’s your fault for personifying us,\nso no complaining. Of course, some of the old spren have four genders\ninstead of two.”\n“What? Why?”\nShe poked him in the nose. “Because humans didn’t imagine those ones,\nsilly.” She zipped out in front of him, changing into a field of mist. When he\nraised his hand, the Shardblade appeared.\nHe strode to where Roshone sat, then stooped down and held the\nShardblade before the man, point toward the floor.\nRoshone looked up, transfixed by the weapon’s blade, as Kaladin had\nanticipated. You couldn’t be near one of these things and not be drawn by it.\nThey had a magnetism.\n“How did you get it?” Roshone asked.\n“Does it matter?”\nHe didn’t reply, but they both knew the truth.

Owning a Shardblade was\nenough—if you could claim it, and not have it taken from you, it was yours.\nWith one in his possession, the brands on his head were meaningless. No\nman, not even Roshone, would imply otherwise.\n“You,” Kaladin said, “are a cheat, a rat, and a murderer. But as much as I\nhate it, we don’t have time to oust Alethkar’s ruling class and set up\nsomething better. We are under attack by an enemy we do not understand,\nand which we could not have anticipated. So you’re going to have to stand\nup and lead these people.”\nRoshone stared at the blade, looking at his reflection.\n“We’re not powerless,” Kaladin said. “We can and will fight back—but\nfirst we need to survive. The Everstorm will return. Regularly, though I\ndon’t know the interval yet. I need you to prepare.”\n“How?” Roshone whispered.\n“Build homes with slopes in both directions. If there’s not time for that,\nfind a sheltered location and hunker down. I can’t stay. This crisis is bigger\nthan one town, one people, even if it’s my town and my people. I have to\nrely on you. Almighty preserve us, you’re all we have.”\nRoshone slumped down farther in his seat. Great. Kaladin stood and\ndismissed Syl.\n“We’ll do it,” a voice said from behind him.\nKaladin froze. Laral’s voice sent a shiver down his spine. He turned\nslowly, and found a woman who did not at all match the image in his head.\nWhen he’d last seen her, she’d been wearing a perfect lighteyed dress,\nbeautiful and young, yet her pale green eyes had seemed hollow. She’d lost\nher betrothed, Roshone’s son, and had instead become engaged to the father\n—a man more than twice her age.\nThe woman he confronted was no longer a youth. Her face was firm,\nlean, and her hair was pulled back in a no-nonsense tail of black peppered\nwith blonde. She wore boots and a utilitarian havah, damp from the rain.\nShe looked him up and down, then sniffed. “Looks like you went and\ngrew up, Kal. I was sorry to hear the news of your brother. Come now. You\nneed a spanreed? I’ve got one to the queen regent in Kholinar, but that one\nhasn’t been responsive lately. Fortunately, we do have one to Tashikk, as\nyou asked about. If you think that the king will respond to you, we can go\nthrough an intermediary.”\nShe walked back out the doorway.\n“Laral…” he said, following.\n“I hear you stabbed my floor,” she noted. “That’s good hardwood, I’ll\nhave you know. Honestly. Men and their weapons.”\n“I dreamed of coming back,” Kaladin said, stopping in the hallway\noutside the library. “I imagined returning here a war hero and challenging\nRoshone. I wanted to save you, Laral.”\n“Oh?” She turned back to him. “And what made you think I needed\nsaving?”"

Or I was, until the winds started blowing the\nwrong direction.” She shook her head. “You take after your father. Always\nfeeling like you need to save everyone, even those who would rather you\nmind your own business.”\n“Roshone brutalized my family. He sent my brother to his death and did\neverything he could to destroy my father!”\n“And your father spoke against my husband,” Laral said, “disparaging\nhim in front of the other townspeople. How would you feel, as a new\nbrightlord exiled far from home, only to find that the town’s most important\ncitizen is openly critical of you?”\nHer perspective was skewed, of course. Lirin had tried to befriend\nRoshone at first, hadn’t he? Still, Kaladin found little passion to continue\nthe argument. What did he care? He intended to see his parents moved from\nthis city anyway.\n“I’ll go set up the spanreed,” she said. “It might take some time to get a\nreply. In the meantime, the ardents should be fetching your maps.”\n“Great,” Kaladin said, pushing past her in the hallway. “I’m going to go\nspeak with my parents.”\nSyl zipped over his shoulder as he started down the steps. “So, that’s the\ngirl you were going to marry.”\n“No,” Kaladin whispered. “That’s a girl I was never going to marry, no\nmatter what happened.”\n“I like her.”\n“You would.” He reached the bottom of the steps and looked back up.\nRoshone had joined Laral at the top of the stairs, carrying the gems Kaladin\nhad left on the table. How much had that been?\nFive or six ruby broams, he thought, and maybe a sapphire or two. He\ndid the calculations in his head. Storms … That was a ridiculous sum—\nmore money than the goblet full of spheres that Roshone and Kaladin’s\nfather had spent years fighting over back in the day. That was now mere\npocket change to Kaladin.\nHe’d always thought of all lighteyes as rich, but a minor brightlord in an\ninsignificant town … well, Roshone was actually poor, just a different kind\nof poor.\nKaladin searched back through the house, passing people he’d once\nknown—people who now whispered “Shardbearer” and got out of his way\nwith alacrity. So be it. He’d accepted his place the moment he’d seized Syl\nfrom the air and spoken the Words.\nLirin was back in the parlor, working on the wounded again.

As the man\nreached toward his tray of tools, Kaladin picked it up and held it at the\nready. His old position as his father’s surgery assistant. The new apprentice\nwas helping with wounded in another room.\nLirin eyed Kaladin, then turned back to the patient, a young boy who had\na bloodied bandage around his arm. “Scissors,” Lirin said.\nKaladin proffered them, and Lirin took the tool without looking, then\ncarefully cut the bandage free. A jagged length of wood had speared the\nboy’s arm. He whimpered as Lirin palpated the flesh nearby, covered in\ndried blood. It didn’t look good.\n“Cut out the shaft,” Kaladin said, “and the necrotic flesh. Cauterize.”\n“A little extreme, don’t you think?” Lirin asked.\n“Might want to remove it at the elbow anyway. That’s going to get\ninfected for sure—look how dirty that wood is. It will leave splinters.”\nThe boy whimpered again. Lirin patted him. “You’ll be fine. I don’t see\nany rotspren yet, and so we’re not going to take the arm off. Let me talk to\nyour parents. For now, chew on this.” He gave the boy some bark as a\nrelaxant.\nTogether, Lirin and Kaladin moved on; the boy wasn’t in immediate\ndanger, and Lirin would want to operate after the anesthetic took effect.\n“You’ve hardened,” Lirin said to Kaladin as he inspected the next\npatient’s foot. “I was worried you’d never grow calluses.”\nKaladin didn’t reply. In truth, his calluses weren’t as deep as his father\nmight have wanted.\n“But you’ve also become one of them,” Lirin said.\n“My eye color doesn’t change a thing.”\n“I wasn’t speaking of your eye color, son. I don’t give two chips whether\na man is lighteyed or not.” He waved a hand, and Kaladin passed him a rag\nto clean the toe, then started preparing a small splint.\n“What you’ve become,” Lirin continued, “is a killer. You solve problems\nwith the fist and the sword. I had hoped that you would find a place among\nthe army’s surgeons.”\n“I wasn’t given much choice,” Kaladin said, handing over the splint,\nthen preparing some bandages to wrap the toe. “It’s a long story. I’ll tell you\nsometime.” The less soul-crushing parts of it, at least.\n“I don’t suppose you’re going to stay.”\n“No. I need to follow those parshmen.”\n“More killing, then.”\n“And you honestly think we shouldn’t fight the Voidbringers, Father?”\nLirin hesitated. “No,” he whispered. “I know that war is inevitable. I just\ndidn’t want you to have to be a part of it. I’ve seen what it does to men. War\nflays their souls, and those are wounds I can’t heal.” He secured the splint,"

The entire place was lit only by candles, and not many of them.\nEverywhere he went, he saw shadows and uncertain light.\nHe filled his canteen with fresh water and found a small umbrella. He’d\nneed that for reading maps in this rain. From there, he went hiking up to\ncheck on Laral in the library. Roshone had retreated to his room, but she\nwas sitting at a writing table with a spanreed before her.\nWait. The spanreed was working. Its ruby glowed.\n“Stormlight!” Kaladin said, pointing.\n“Well, of course,” she said, frowning at him. “Fabrials require it.”\n“How do you have infused spheres?”\n“The highstorm,” Laral said. “Just a few days back.”\nDuring the clash with the Voidbringers, the Stormfather had summoned\nan irregular highstorm to match the Everstorm. Kaladin had flown before its\nstormwall, fighting the Assassin in White.\n“That storm was unexpected,” Kaladin said. “How in the world did you\nknow to leave your spheres out?”\n“Kal,” she said, “it’s not so hard to hang some spheres out once a storm\nstarts blowing!”\n“How many do you have?”\n“Some,” Laral said. “The ardents have a few—I wasn’t the only one to\nthink of it. Look, I’ve got someone in Tashikk willing to relay a message to\nNavani Kholin, the king’s mother. Wasn’t that what you implied you\nwanted? You really think she’ll respond to you?”\nThe answer, blessedly, came as the spanreed started writing. “ ‘Captain?’\n” Laral read. “ ‘This is Navani Kholin. Is it really you?’ ”\nLaral blinked, then looked up at him.\n“It is,” Kaladin said. “The last thing I did before leaving was speak with\nDalinar at the top of the tower.” Hopefully that would be enough to\nauthenticate him.\nLaral jumped, then wrote it.\n“ ‘Kaladin, this is Dalinar,’ ” Laral read as the message came back. “\n‘What is your status, soldier?’ ”\n“Better than expected, sir,” Kaladin said. He outlined what he’d\ndiscovered, in brief. He ended by noting, “I’m worried that they left"

He ended by noting, “I’m worried that they left\nbecause Hearthstone wasn’t important enough to bother destroying. I’ve\nordered horses and some maps. I figure I can do a little scouting and see\nwhat I can find about the enemy.”\n“ ‘Careful,’ ” Dalinar responded. “ ‘You don’t have any Stormlight left?’\n”\n“I might be able to find a little. I doubt it will be enough to get me home,\nbut it will help.”\nIt took a few minutes before Dalinar replied, and Laral took the\nopportunity to change the paper on the spanreed board.\n“ ‘Your instincts are good, Captain,’ ” Dalinar finally sent. “ ‘I feel blind\nin this tower. Get close enough to discover what the enemy is doing, but\ndon’t take unnecessary risks. Take the spanreed. Send us a glyph each\nevening to know you are safe.’ ”\n“Understood, sir. Life before death.”\n“ ‘Life before death.’ ”\nLaral looked to him, and he nodded that the conversation was over. She\npacked up the spanreed for him without a word, and he took it gratefully,\nthen hurried out of the room and down the steps.\nHis activities had drawn quite a crowd of people, who had gathered in\nthe small entry hall before the steps. He intended to ask if anyone had\ninfused spheres, but was interrupted by the sight of his mother. She was\nspeaking with several young girls, and held a toddler in her arms. What was\nshe doing with …\nKaladin stopped at the foot of the steps. The little boy was perhaps a year\nold, chewing on his hand and babbling around his fingers.\n“Kaladin, meet your brother,” Hesina said, turning toward him. “Some of\nthe girls were watching him while I helped with the triage.”\n“A brother,” Kaladin whispered. It had never occurred to him. His\nmother would be forty-one this year, and …\nA brother.\nKaladin reached out. His mother let him take the little boy, hold him in\nhands that seemed too rough to be touching such soft skin. Kaladin\ntrembled, then pulled the child tight against him. Memories of this place\nhad not broken him, and seeing his parents had not overwhelmed him, but\nthis …\nHe could not stop the tears. He felt like a fool. It wasn’t as if this\nchanged anything—Bridge Four were his brothers now, as close to him as\nany blood relative.\nAnd yet he wept.\n“What’s his name?”\n“Oroden.”\n“Child of peace,” Kaladin whispered. “A good name. A very good\nname.”\nBehind him, an ardent approached with a scroll case. Storms, was that\nZeheb? Still alive, it seemed, though she’d always seemed older than the\nstones themselves. Kaladin handed little Oroden back to his mother, then\nwiped his eyes and took the scroll case.\nPeople crowded at the edges of the room. He was quite the spectacle: the\nsurgeon’s son turned slave turned Shardbearer. Hearthstone wouldn’t see\nthis much excitement for another hundred years.\nAt least not if Kaladin had any say about it. He nodded to his father—"

Bring\nthem forth.”\nSyl buzzed around him as a collection was made, and Kaladin’s mother\nmade the trades for him. What he ended up with was only a pouch’s worth,\nbut it seemed vast riches. At the very least, he wasn’t going to need those\nhorses any longer.\nHe tied the pouch closed, then looked over his shoulder as his father\nstepped up. Lirin took a small glowing diamond chip from his pocket, then\nhanded it toward Kaladin.\nKaladin accepted it, then glanced at his mother and the little boy in her\narms. His brother.\n“I want to take you to safety,” he said to Lirin. “I need to leave now, but\nI’ll be back soon. To take you to—”\n“No,” Lirin said.\n“Father, it’s the Desolation,” Kaladin said.\nNearby, people gasped softly, their eyes haunted. Storms; Kaladin should\nhave done this in private. He leaned in toward Lirin. “I know of a place that\nis safe. For you, Mother. For little Oroden. Please don’t be stubborn, for\nonce in your life.”\n“You can take them, if they’ll go,” Lirin said. “But I’m staying here.\nParticularly if … what you just said is true. These people will need me.”\n“We’ll see. I’ll return as soon as I can.” Kaladin set his jaw, then walked\nto the front door of the manor. He pulled it open, letting in the sounds of\nrain, the scents of a drowned land.\nHe paused, looked back at the room full of dirtied townspeople,\nhomeless and frightened. They’d overheard him, but they’d known already.\nHe’d heard them whispering. Voidbringers. The Desolation.\nHe couldn’t leave them like this.\n“You heard correctly,” Kaladin said loudly to the hundred or so people\ngathered in the manor’s large entry hall—including Roshone and Laral, who\nstood on the steps up to the second floor. “The Voidbringers have returned.”\nMurmurs. Fright.\nKaladin sucked in some of the Stormlight from his pouch. Pure,\nluminescent smoke began to rise from his skin, distinctly visible in the dim\nroom. He Lashed himself upward so he rose into the air, then added a\nLashing downward, leaving him to hover about two feet above the floor,\nglowing. Syl formed from mist as a Shardspear in his hand.\n“Highprince Dalinar Kholin,” Kaladin said, Stormlight puffing before his\nlips, “has refounded the Knights Radiant.

I will protect\nthem all.\nHe nodded to his parents, then turned and Lashed himself outward,\nstreaking away into the rain-soaked night. He’d stop at Stringken, about\nhalf a day’s walk—or a short flight—to the south and see if he could trade\nspheres there.\nThen he’d hunt some Voidbringers.\n8. A Powerful Lie\nThat moment notwithstanding, I can honestly say this book has been\nbrewing in me since my youth.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nShallan drew.\nShe scraped her drawing pad with agitated, bold streaks. She twisted the\ncharcoal stick in her fingers every few lines, seeking the sharpest points to\nmake the lines a deep black.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said from near her calves, where he adorned her skirt\nlike embroidery. “Shallan?”\nShe kept drawing, filling the page with black strokes.\n“Shallan?” Pattern asked. “I understand why you hate me, Shallan. I did\nnot mean to help you kill your mother, but it is what I did. It is what I\ndid.…”\nShallan set her jaw and kept sketching. She sat outside at Urithiru, her\nback against a cold chunk of stone, her toes frigid, coldspren growing up\nlike spikes around her. Her frazzled hair whipped past her face in a gust of\nair, and she had to pin the paper of her pad down with her thumbs, one\ntrapped in her left sleeve.\n“Shallan…” Pattern said.\n“It’s all right,” Shallan said in a hushed voice as the wind died down.\n“Just … just let me draw.”\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “A powerful lie…”\nA simple landscape; she should be able to draw a simple, calming\nlandscape. She sat on the edge of one of the ten Oathgate platforms, which\nrose ten feet higher than the main plateau. Earlier in the day, she’d activated\nthis Oathgate, bringing forth a few hundred more of the thousands who\nwere waiting at Narak. That would be it for a while: each use of the device\nused an incredible amount of Stormlight. Even with the gemstones that the\nnewcomers had brought, there wasn’t much to go around.\nPlus, there wasn’t much of her to go around. Only an active, full Knight\nRadiant could work the control buildings at the center of each platform,\ninitiating the swap. For now, that meant only Shallan.\nIt meant she had to summon her Blade each time. The Blade she’d used\nto kill her mother. A truth she’d spoken as an Ideal of her order of Radiants.\nA truth that she could no longer, therefore, stuff into the back of her\nmind and forget.\nJust draw.\nThe city dominated her view.

Jasnah had searched\nthis place out in the hope of finding books and records here of ancient date;\nso far, they hadn’t found anything like that. Instead, Shallan struggled to\nunderstand the tower.\nIf she locked it down into a sketch, would she finally be able to grasp its\nincredible size? She couldn’t get an angle from which to view the entire\ntower, so she kept fixating on the little things. The balconies, the shapes of\nthe fields, the cavernous openings—maws to engulf, consume, overwhelm.\nShe ended up with a sketch not of the tower itself, but instead a\ncrisscrossing of lines on a field of softer charcoal. She stared at the sketch, a\nwindspren passing and troubling the pages. She sighed, dropping her\ncharcoal into her satchel and getting out a damp rag to wipe her freehand\nfingers.\nDown on the plateau, soldiers ran drills. The thought of them all living in\nthat place disturbed Shallan. Which was stupid. It was just a building.\nBut it was one she couldn’t sketch.\n“Shallan…” Pattern said.\n“We’ll work it out,” she said, eyes forward. “It’s not your fault my\nparents are dead. You didn’t cause it.”\n“You can hate me,” Pattern said. “I understand.”\nShallan closed her eyes. She didn’t want him to understand. She wanted\nhim to convince her she was wrong. She needed to be wrong.\n“I don’t hate you, Pattern,” Shallan said. “I hate the sword.”\n“But—”\n“The sword isn’t you. The sword is me, my father, the life we led, and\nthe way it got twisted all about.”\n“I…” Pattern hummed softly. “I don’t understand.”\nI’d be shocked if you did, Shallan thought. Because I sure don’t.\nFortunately, she had a distraction coming her way in the form of a scout\nclimbing up the ramp to the platform where Shallan perched. The darkeyed\nwoman wore white and blue, with trousers beneath a runner’s skirt, and had\nlong, dark Alethi hair.\n“Um, Brightness Radiant?” the scout asked after bowing. “The\nhighprince has requested your presence.”\n“Bother,” Shallan said, while inwardly relieved to have something to do.\nShe handed the scout her sketchbook to hold while she packed up her\nsatchel.\nDun spheres, she noted.\nWhile three of the highprinces had joined Dalinar on his expedition to\nthe center of the Shattered Plains, the greater number had remained behind.\nWhen the unexpected highstorm had come, Hatham had received word via\nspanreed from scouts out along the plains.\nHis warcamp had been able to get out most of their spheres for\nrecharging before the storm hit, giving him a huge amount of Stormlight\ncompared to the rest of them. He was becoming a wealthy man as Dalinar\ntraded for infused spheres to work the Oathgate and bring in supplies.\nCompared to that, providing spheres to her to practice her Lightweaving\nwasn’t a terrible expense—but she still felt guilty to see that she’d drained\ntwo of them by consuming Stormlight to help her with the chill air.

She’d\nhave to be careful about that.\nShe got everything packed, then reached back for the sketchbook and\nfound the scout woman flipping through the pages with wide eyes.\n“Brightness…” she said. “These are amazing.”\nSeveral were sketches as if looking up from the base of the tower,\ncatching a vague sense of Urithiru’s stateliness, but more giving a sense of\nvertigo. With dissatisfaction, Shallan realized she’d enhanced the surreal\nnature of the sketches with impossible vanishing points and perspective.\n“I’ve been trying to draw the tower,” Shallan said, “but I can’t get it\nfrom the right angle.” Maybe when Brightlord Brooding-Eyes returned, he\ncould fly her to another peak along the mountain chain.\n“I’ve never seen anything like these,” the scout said, flipping pages.\n“What do you call it?”\n“Surrealism,” Shallan said, taking the large sketchbook back and tucking\nit under her arm. “It was an old artistic movement. I guess I defaulted to it\nwhen I couldn’t get the picture to look how I wanted. Hardly anyone\nbothers with it anymore except students.”\n“It made my eyes make my brain think it forgot to wake up.”\nShallan gestured, and the scout led the way back down and across the\nplateau. Here, Shallan noticed that more than a few soldiers on the field had\nstopped their drills and were watching her. Bother. She would never again\nreturn to being just Shallan, the insignificant girl from a backwater town.\nShe was now “Brightness Radiant,” ostensibly from the Order of\nElsecallers. She’d persuaded Dalinar to pretend—in public, at least—that\nShallan was from an order that couldn’t make illusions. She needed to keep\nthat secret from spreading, or her effectiveness would be weakened.\nThe soldiers stared at her as if they expected her to grow Shardplate,\nshoot gouts of flame from her eyes, and fly off to tear down a mountain or\ntwo. Probably should try to act more composed, Shallan thought to herself.\nMore … knightly?\nShe glanced at a soldier who wore the gold and red of Hatham’s army.\nHe immediately looked down and rubbed at the glyphward prayer tied\naround his upper right arm. Dalinar was determined to recover the\nreputation of the Radiants, but storms, you couldn’t change an entire\nnation’s perspective in a matter of a few months. The ancient Knights\nRadiant had betrayed humankind; while many Alethi seemed willing to give\nthe orders a fresh start, others weren’t so charitable.\nStill, she tried to keep her head high, her back straight, and to walk more\nlike her tutors had always instructed. Power was an illusion of perception,\nas Jasnah had said. The first step to being in control was to see yourself as\ncapable of being in control.\nThe scout led her into the tower and up a flight of stairs, toward\nDalinar’s secure section. “Brightness?” the woman asked as they walked.\n“Can I ask you a question?”\n“As that was a question, apparently you can.”\n“Oh, um. Huh.”\n“It’s fine. What did you want to know?”\n“You’re … a Radiant.”"

What did you want to know?”\n“You’re … a Radiant.”\n“That one was actually a statement, and that’s making me doubt my\nprevious assertion.”\n“I’m sorry. I just … I’m curious, Brightness. How does it work? Being a\nRadiant? You have a Shardblade?”\nSo that was where this was going. “I assure you,” Shallan said, “it is\nquite possible to remain properly feminine while fulfilling my duties as a\nknight.”\n“Oh,” the scout said. Oddly, she seemed disappointed by that response.\n“Of course, Brightness.”\nUrithiru seemed to have been crafted straight from the rock of a\nmountain, like a sculpture. Indeed, there weren’t seams at the corners of\nrooms, nor were there distinct bricks or blocks in the walls. Much of the\nstone exposed thin lines of strata. Beautiful lines of varied hue, like layers\nof cloth stacked in a merchant’s shop.\nThe corridors often twisted about in strange curves, rarely running\nstraight toward an intersection. Dalinar suggested that perhaps this was to\nfool invaders, like a castle fortification. The sweeping turns and lack of\nseams made the corridors feel like tunnels.\nShallan didn’t need a guide—the strata that cut through the walls had\ndistinctive patterns. Others seemed to have trouble telling those apart, and\ntalked of painting the floors with guidelines. Couldn’t they distinguish the\npattern here of wide reddish strata alternating with smaller yellow ones?\nJust go in the direction where the lines were sloping slightly upward, and\nyou’d head toward Dalinar’s quarters.\nThey soon arrived, and the scout took up duty at the door in case her\nservices were needed again. Shallan entered a room that only a day before\nhad been empty, but was now arrayed with furniture, creating a large\nmeeting place right outside Dalinar and Navani’s private rooms.\nAdolin, Renarin, and Navani sat before Dalinar, who stood with hands\non hips, contemplating a map of Roshar on the wall. Though the place was\nstuffed with rugs and plush furniture, the finery fit this bleak chamber like a\nlady’s havah fit a pig.\n“I don’t know how to approach the Azish, Father,” Renarin was saying\nas she entered. “Their new emperor makes them unpredictable.”\n“They’re Azish,” Adolin said, giving Shallan a wave with his unwounded\nhand. “How can they not be predictable? Doesn’t their government mandate\nhow to peel your fruit?”\n“That’s a stereotype,” Renarin said. He wore his Bridge Four uniform,\nbut had a blanket over his shoulders and was holding a cup of steaming tea,\nthough the room wasn’t particularly cold. “Yes, they have a large\nbureaucracy. A change in government is still going to cause upheaval. In\nfact, it might be easier for this new Azish emperor to change policy, since\npolicy is well defined enough to change.”\n“I wouldn’t worry about the Azish,” Navani said, tapping her notepad\nwith a pen, then writing something in it. “They’ll listen to reason; they\nalways do. What about Tukar and Emul? I wouldn’t be surprised if that war"

I wouldn’t be surprised if that war\nof theirs is enough to distract them even from the return of the Desolations.”\nDalinar grunted, rubbing his chin with one hand. “There’s that warlord in\nTukar. What’s his name?”\n“Tezim,” Navani said. “Claims he’s an aspect of the Almighty.”\nShallan sniffed as she slipped into the seat beside Adolin, setting her\nsatchel and drawing pad on the floor. “Aspect of the Almighty? At least he’s\nhumble.”\nDalinar turned toward her, then clasped his hands behind his back.\nStorms. He always seemed so … large. Bigger than any room he was in,\nbrow perpetually furrowed by the deepest of thoughts. Dalinar Kholin could\nmake choosing what to have for breakfast look like the most important\ndecision in all of Roshar.\n“Brightness Shallan,” he said. “Tell me, how would you deal with the\nMakabaki kingdoms? Now that the storm has come as we warned, we have\nan opportunity to approach them from a position of strength. Azir is the\nmost important, but just faced a succession crisis. Emul and Tukar are, of\ncourse, at war, as Navani noted. We could certainly use Tashikk’s\ninformation networks, but they’re so isolationist. That leaves Yezier and\nLiafor. Perhaps the weight of their involvement would persuade their\nneighbors?”\nHe turned toward her expectantly.\n“Yes, yes…” Shallan said, thoughtful. “I have heard of several of those\nplaces.”\nDalinar drew his lips to a line, and Pattern hummed in concern on her\nskirts. Dalinar did not seem the type of man you joked with.\n“I’m sorry, Brightlord,” Shallan continued, leaning back in her chair.\n“But I’m confused as to why you want my input. I know of those kingdoms,\nof course—but my knowledge is an academic thing. I could probably name\ntheir primary export for you, but as to foreign policy … well, I’d never even\nspoken to someone from Alethkar before leaving my homeland. And we’re\nneighbors!”\n“I see,” Dalinar said softly. “Does your spren offer some counsel? Could\nyou bring him out to speak to us?”\n“Pattern? He’s not particularly knowledgeable about our kind, which is\nsort of why he’s here in the first place.” She shifted in her seat. “And to be\nfrank, Brightlord, I think he’s scared of you.”\n“Well, he’s obviously not a fool,” Adolin noted.\nDalinar shot his son a glance.\n“Don’t be like that, Father,” Adolin said. “If anyone would be able to go\nabout intimidating forces of nature, it would be you.”\nDalinar sighed, turning and resting his hand on the map. Curiously, it\nwas Renarin who stood up, setting aside his blanket and cup, then walked\nover to put his hand on his father’s shoulder.

Young\nShallan spoke wisdom, though she might not have recognized it. We don’t\nknow these people. Now I’m expected to be responsible for them?

Perhaps\nhe’d sent for her because he’d wanted to seek the aid of his Radiants, but\nthe Kholin dynamic had always been a family one. In that, she was an\nintruder.\nDalinar turned and walked to fetch a cup of wine from a warmed pitcher\nnear the door. As he passed Shallan, she felt something unusual. A leaping\nwithin her, as if part of her were being pulled by him.\nHe walked past again, holding a cup, and Shallan slipped from her seat,\nfollowing him toward the map on the wall. She breathed in as she walked,\ndrawing Stormlight from her satchel in a shimmering stream. It infused her,\nglowing from her skin.\nShe rested her freehand against the map. Stormlight poured off her,\nilluminating the map in a swirling tempest of Light. She didn’t exactly\nunderstand what she was doing, but she rarely did. Art wasn’t about\nunderstanding, but about knowing.\nThe Stormlight streamed off the map, passing between her and Dalinar\nin a rush, causing Navani to scramble off her seat and back away. The Light\nswirled in the chamber and became another, larger map—floating at about\ntable height—in the center of the room. Mountains grew up like furrows in\na piece of cloth pressed together. Vast plains shone green from vines and\nfields of grass. Barren stormward hillsides grew splendid shadows of life on\nthe leeward sides. Stormfather … as she watched, the topography of the\nlandscape became real.\nShallan’s breath caught. Had she done that? How? Her illusions usually\nrequired a previous drawing to imitate.\nThe map stretched to the sides of the room, shimmering at the edges.\nAdolin stood up from his seat, crashing through the middle of the illusion\nsomewhere near Kharbranth. Wisps of Stormlight broke around him, but\nwhen he moved, the image swirled and neatly re-formed behind him.\n“How…” Dalinar leaned down near their section, which detailed the\nReshi Isles. “The detail is amazing. I can almost see the cities. What did\nyou do?”\n“I don’t know if I did anything,” Shallan said, stepping into the illusion,\nfeeling the Stormlight swirl around her. Despite the detail, the perspective\nwas still from very far away, and the mountains weren’t even as tall as one\nof her fingernails. “I couldn’t have created this, Brightlord. I don’t have the\nknowledge.”\n“Well I didn’t do it,” Renarin said. “The Stormlight quite certainly came\nfrom you, Brightness.”\n“Yes, well, your father was tugging on me at the time.”"

It wasn’t me or you, but us.\nSomehow.”\n“Well,” Shallan noted, “you were complaining about not being able to\ntake it all in.”\n“How much Stormlight did this take?” Navani asked, rounding the\noutside of the new, vibrant map.\nShallan checked her satchel. “Um … all of it.”\n“We’ll get you more,” Navani said with a sigh.\n“I’m sorry for—”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “Having my Radiants practice with their powers is\namong the most valuable resources I could purchase right now. Even if\nHatham makes us pay through the nose for spheres.”\nDalinar strode through the image, disrupting it in a swirl around him. He\nstopped near the center, beside the location of Urithiru. He looked from one\nside of the room to the other in a long, slow survey.\n“Ten cities,” he whispered. “Ten kingdoms. Ten Oathgates connecting\nthem from long ago. This is how we fight it. This is how we begin. We don’t\nstart by saving the world—we start with this simple step. We protect the\ncities with Oathgates.\n“The Voidbringers are everywhere, but we can be more mobile. We can\nshore up capitals, deliver food or Soulcasters quickly between kingdoms.\nWe can make those ten cities bastions of light and strength. But we must be\nquick. He’s coming. The man with nine shadows…”\n“What’s this?” Shallan said, perking up.\n“The enemy’s champion,” Dalinar said, eyes narrowing. “In the visions,\nHonor told me our best chance of survival involved forcing Odium to\naccept a contest of champions. I’ve seen the enemy’s champion—a creature\nin black armor, with red eyes. A parshman perhaps. It had nine shadows.”\nNearby, Renarin had turned toward his father, eyes wide, jaw dropping.\nNobody else seemed to notice.\n“Azimir, capital of Azir,” Dalinar said, stepping from Urithiru to the\ncenter of Azir to the west, “is home to an Oathgate. We need to open it and\ngain the trust of the Azish. They will be important to our cause.”\nHe stepped farther to the west. “There’s an Oathgate hidden in Shinovar.\nAnother in the capital of Babatharnam, and a fourth in far-off Rall Elorim,\nCity of Shadows.”\n“Another in Rira,” Navani said, joining him. “Jasnah thought it was in\nKurth. A sixth was lost in Aimia, the island that was destroyed.”\nDalinar grunted, then turned toward the map’s eastern section. “Vedenar\nmakes seven,” he said, stepping into Shallan’s homeland. “Thaylen City is\neight. Then the Shattered Plains, which we hold.”\n“And the last one is in Kholinar,” Adolin said softly. “Our home.”"

Spanreed\ncommunication into the city had stopped working. Nobody knew the status\nof Kholinar; their best clue had come via Kaladin’s spanreed message.\n“We start small,” Dalinar said, “with a few of the most important to\nholding the world. Azir. Jah Keved. Thaylenah. We’ll contact other nations,\nbut our focus is on these three powerhouses. Azir for its organization and\npolitical clout. Thaylenah for its shipping and naval prowess. Jah Keved for\nits manpower. Brightness Davar, any insight you could offer into your\nhomeland—and its status following the civil war—would be appreciated.”\n“And Kholinar?” Adolin asked.\nA knock at the door interrupted Dalinar’s response. He called\nadmittance, and the scout from before peeked in. “Brightlord,” she said,\nlooking concerned. “There’s something you need to see.”\n“What is it, Lyn?”\n“Brightlord, sir. There’s … there’s been another murder.”\n9. The Threads of a Screw\nThe sum of my experiences has pointed at this moment. This decision.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nOne benefit of having become “Brightness Radiant” was that for once,\nShallan was expected to be a part of important events. Nobody questioned\nher presence during the rush through the corridors, lit by oil lanterns carried\nby guards. Nobody thought she was out of place; nobody even considered\nthe propriety of leading a young woman to the scene of a brutal murder.\nWhat a welcome change.\nFrom what she overheard the scout telling Dalinar, the corpse had been a\nlighteyed officer named Vedekar Perel. He was from Sebarial’s army, but\nShallan didn’t know him. The body had been discovered by a scouting party\nin a remote part of the tower’s second level.\nAs they drew nearer, Dalinar and his guards jogged the rest of the\ndistance, outpacing Shallan. Storming Alethi long legs. She tried to suck in\nsome Stormlight—but she’d used it all on that blasted map, which had\ndisintegrated into a puff of Light as they’d left.\nThat left her exhausted and annoyed. Ahead of her, Adolin stopped and\nlooked back. He danced a moment, as if impatient, then hurried to her\ninstead of running ahead.\n“Thanks,” Shallan said as he fell into step beside her.\n“It’s not like he can get more dead, eh?” he said, then chuckled\nawkwardly. Something about this had him seriously disturbed.\nHe reached for her hand with his hurt one, which was still splinted, then\nwinced. She took his arm instead, and he held up his oil lantern as they\nhurried on. The strata here spiraled, twisting around the floor, ceiling, and\nwalls like the threads of a screw. It was striking enough that Shallan took a\nMemory of it for later sketching.\nShallan and Adolin finally caught up to the others, passing a group of\nguards maintaining a perimeter. Though Bridge Four had discovered the\nbody, they’d sent for Kholin reinforcements to secure the area."

Though Bridge Four had discovered the\nbody, they’d sent for Kholin reinforcements to secure the area.\nThey protected a medium-sized chamber now lit by a multitude of oil\nlamps. Shallan paused in the doorway right before a ledge that surrounded a\nwide square depression, perhaps four feet deep, cut into the stone floor of\nthe room. The wall strata here continued their curving, twisting medley of\noranges, reds, and browns—ballooning out across the sides of this chamber\nin wide bands before coiling back into narrow stripes to continue down the\nhall that led out the other side.\nThe dead man lay at the bottom of the cavity. Shallan steeled herself, but\neven so found the sight nauseating. He lay on his back, and had been\nstabbed right through the eye. His face was a bloody mess, his clothing\ndisheveled from what looked to have been an extended fight.\nDalinar and Navani stood on the ledge above the pit. His face was stiff, a\nstone. She stood with her safehand raised to her lips.\n“We found him just like this, Brightlord,” said Peet the bridgeman. “We\nsent for you immediately. Storm me if it doesn’t look exactly the same as\nwhat happened to Highprince Sadeas.”\n“He’s even lying in the same position,” Navani said, grabbing her skirts\nand descending a set of steps into the lower area. It made up almost the\nentire room. In fact …\nShallan looked toward the upper reaches of the chamber, where several\nstone sculptures—like the heads of horses—extended from the walls with\ntheir mouths open. Spouts, she thought. This was a bathing chamber.\nNavani knelt beside the body, away from the blood running toward a\ndrain on the far side of the basin. “Remarkable … the positioning, the\npuncturing of the eye … It’s exactly like what happened to Sadeas. This has\nto be the same killer.”\nNobody tried to shelter Navani from the sight—as if it were completely\nproper for the king’s mother to be poking at a corpse. Who knew? Maybe in\nAlethkar, ladies were expected to do this sort of thing. It was still odd to\nShallan how temerarious the Alethi were about towing their women into\nbattle to act as scribes, runners, and scouts.\nShe looked to Adolin to get his read on the situation, and found him\nstaring, aghast, mouth open and eyes wide. “Adolin?” Shallan asked. “Did\nyou know him?”\nHe didn’t seem to hear her. “This is impossible,” he muttered.\n“Impossible.”\n“Adolin?”\n“I … No, I didn’t know him, Shallan. But I’d assumed … I mean, I\nfigured the death of Sadeas was an isolated crime. You know how he was.\nProbably got himself into trouble. Any number of people could have wanted\nhim dead, right?”\n“Looks like it was something more than that,” Shallan said, folding her\narms as Dalinar walked down the steps to join Navani, trailed by Peet,\nLopen, and—remarkably—Rlain of Bridge Four.

They considered him a danger,\nregardless of which uniform he wore.\n“Colot?” Dalinar said, looking toward the lighteyed captain who led the\nsoldiers here. “You’re an archer, aren’t you? Fifth Battalion?”\n“Yes, sir!”\n“We have you scouting the tower with Bridge Four?” Dalinar asked.\n“The Windrunners needed extra feet, sir, and access to more scouts and\nscribes for maps. My archers are mobile. Figured it was better than doing\nparade drills in the cold, so I volunteered my company.”\nDalinar grunted. “Fifth Battalion … who was your policing force?”\n“Eighth Company,” Colot said. “Captain Tallan. Good friend of mine.\nHe … didn’t make it, sir.”\n“I’m sorry, Captain,” Dalinar said. “Would you and your men withdraw\nfor a moment so I can consult with my son? Maintain that perimeter until I\ntell you otherwise, but do inform King Elhokar of this and send a messenger\nto Sebarial. I’ll visit and tell him about this in person, but he’d best get a\nwarning.”\n“Yes, sir,” the lanky archer said, calling orders. The soldiers left,\nincluding the bridgemen. As they moved, Shallan felt something prickle at\nthe back of her neck. She shivered, and couldn’t help glancing over her\nshoulder, hating how this unfathomable building made her feel.\nRenarin was standing right behind her. She jumped, letting out a pathetic\nsqueak. Then she blushed furiously; she’d forgotten he was even with them.\nA few shamespren faded into view around her, floating white and red flower\npetals. She’d rarely attracted those, which was a wonder. She’d have\nthought they would take up permanent residence nearby.\n“Sorry,” Renarin mumbled. “Didn’t mean to sneak up on you.”\nAdolin walked down into the room’s basin, still looking distracted. Was\nhe that upset by finding a murderer among them? People tried to kill him\npractically every day. Shallan grabbed the skirt of her havah and followed\nhim down, staying clear of the blood.\n“This is troubling,” Dalinar said. “We face a terrible threat that would\nwipe our kind from Roshar like leaves before the stormwall. I don’t have\ntime to worry about a murderer slinking through these tunnels.” He looked\nup at Adolin. “Most of the men I’d have assigned to an investigation like\nthis are dead. Niter, Malan … the King’s Guard is no better, and the\nbridgemen—for all their fine qualities—have no experience with this sort of\nthing. I’ll need to leave it to you, son.”\n“Me?” Adolin said.\n“You did well investigating the incident with the king’s saddle, even if\nthat turned out to be something of a wind chase. Aladar is Highprince of\nInformation. Go to him, explain what happened, and set one of his policing\nteams to investigate. Then work with them as my liaison.”\n“You want me,” Adolin said, “to investigate who killed Sadeas.”"

Then work with them as my liaison.”\n“You want me,” Adolin said, “to investigate who killed Sadeas.”\nDalinar nodded, squatting down beside the corpse, though Shallan had\nno idea what he expected to see. The fellow was very dead. “Perhaps if I\nput my son on the job, it will convince people I’m serious about finding the\nkiller. Perhaps not—they might just think I’ve put someone in charge who\ncan keep the secret. Storms, I miss Jasnah. She would have known how to\nspin this, to keep opinion from turning against us in court.\n“Either way, son, stay on this. Make sure the remaining highprinces at\nleast know that we consider these murders a priority, and that we are\ndedicated to finding the one who committed them.”\nAdolin swallowed. “I understand.”\nShallan narrowed her eyes. What had gotten into him? She glanced\ntoward Renarin, who still stood up above, on the walkway around the empty\npool. He watched Adolin with unblinking sapphire eyes. He was always a\nlittle strange, but he seemed to know something she didn’t.\nOn her skirt, Pattern hummed softly.\nDalinar and Navani eventually left to speak with Sebarial. Once they\nwere gone, Shallan seized Adolin by the arm. “What’s wrong?” she hissed.\n“You knew that dead man, didn’t you? Do you know who killed him?”\nHe looked her in the eyes. “I have no idea who did this, Shallan. But I\nam going to find out.”\nShe held his light blue eyes, weighing his gaze. Storms, what was she\nthinking? Adolin was a wonderful man, but he was about as deceitful as a\nnewborn.\nHe stalked off, and Shallan hurried after him. Renarin remained in the\nroom, looking down the hall after them until Shallan got far enough away\nthat—over her shoulder—she could no longer see him.\n10. Distractions\nPerhaps my heresy stretches back to those days in my childhood, where\nthese ideas began.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nKaladin leaped from a hilltop, preserving Stormlight by Lashing himself\nupward just enough to give him some lift.\nHe soared through the rain, angled toward another hilltop. Beneath him,\nthe valley was clogged with vivim trees, which wound their spindly\nbranches together to create an almost impenetrable wall of forestation.\nHe landed lightly, skidding across the wet stone past rainspren like blue\ncandles. He dismissed his Lashing, and as the force of the ground reasserted\nitself, he stepped into a quick march. He’d learned to march before learning\nthe spear or shield. Kaladin smiled. He could almost hear Hav’s voice\nbarking commands from the back of the line, where he helped stragglers.\nHav had always said that once men could march together, learning to fight\nwas easy.\n“Smiling?” Syl said. She’d taken the shape of a large raindrop streaking\nthrough the air beside him, falling the wrong way. It was a natural shape,\nbut also completely wrong. Plausible impossibility."

Plausible impossibility.\n“You’re right,” Kaladin said, rain dribbling down his face. “I should be\nmore solemn. We’re chasing down Voidbringers.” Storms, how odd it\nsounded to say that.\n“I didn’t intend it as a reprimand.”\n“Hard to tell with you sometimes.”\n“And what was that supposed to mean?”\n“Two days ago, I found that my mother is still alive,” Kaladin said, “so\nthe position is not, in fact, vacant. You can stop trying to fill it.”\nHe Lashed himself upward slightly, then let himself slide down the wet\nstone of the steep hill, standing sideways. He passed open rockbuds and\nwiggling vines, glutted and fat from the constant rainfall. Following the\nWeeping, they’d often find as many dead plants around the town as they did\nafter a strong highstorm.\n“Well, I’m not trying to mother you,” Syl said, still a raindrop. Talking to\nher could be a surreal experience. “Though perhaps I chide you on\noccasion, when you’re being sullen.”\nHe grunted.\n“Or when you’re being uncommunicative.” She transformed into the\nshape of a young woman in a havah, seated in the air and holding an\numbrella as she moved along beside him. “It is my solemn and important\nduty to bring happiness, light, and joy into your world when you’re being a\ndour idiot. Which is most of the time. So there.”\nKaladin chuckled, holding a little Stormlight as he ran up the side of the\nnext hill, then skidded down into the next valley. This was prime farmland;\nthere was a reason why the Akanny region was prized by Sadeas. It might\nbe a cultural backwater, but these rolling fields probably fed half the\nkingdom with their lavis and tallew crops. Other villages focused on raising\nlarge passels of hogs for leather and meat. Gumfrems, a kind of chull-like\nbeast, were less common pasture animals harvested for their gemhearts,\nwhich—though small—allowed Soulcasting of meat.\nSyl turned into a ribbon of light and zipped in front of him, making\nloops. It was difficult not to feel uplifted, even in the gloomy weather. He’d\nspent the entire sprint to Alethkar worrying—and then assuming—that he’d\nbe too late to save Hearthstone. To find his parents alive … well, it was an\nunexpected blessing. The type his life had been severely lacking.\nSo he gave in to the urging of the Stormlight. Run. Leap. Though he’d\nspent two days chasing the Voidbringers, Kaladin’s exhaustion had faded.\nThere weren’t many empty beds to be found in the broken villages he\npassed, but he had been able to find a roof to keep him dry and something\nwarm to eat.\nHe’d started at Hearthstone and worked his way outward in a spiral—\nvisiting villages, asking after the local parshmen, then warning people that\nthe terrible storm would return. So far, he hadn’t found a single town or\nvillage that had been attacked."

So far, he hadn’t found a single town or\nvillage that had been attacked.\nKaladin reached the next hilltop and pulled to a stop. A weathered stone\npost marked a crossroads. During his youth, he’d never gotten this far from\nHearthstone, though he wasn’t more than a few days’ walk away.\nSyl zipped up to him as he shaded his eyes from the rain. The glyphs and\nsimple map on the stone marker would indicate the distance to the next\ntown—but he didn’t need that. He could make it out as a smudge in the\ngloom. A fairly large town, by local standards.\n“Come on,” he said, starting down the hillside.\n“I think,” Syl said, landing on his shoulder and becoming a young\nwoman, “I would make a wonderful mother.”\n“And what inspired this topic?”\n“You’re the one who brought it up.”\nIn comparing Syl to his mother for nagging him? “Are you even capable\nof having children? Baby spren?”\n“I have no idea,” Syl proclaimed.\n“You call the Stormfather … well, Father. Right? So he birthed you?”\n“Maybe? I think so? Helped shape me, is more like it. Helped us find our\nvoices.” She cocked her head. “Yes. He made some of us. Made me.”\n“So maybe you could do that,” Kaladin said. “Find little, uh, bits of the\nwind? Or of Honor? Shape them?”\nHe used a Lashing to leap over a snarl of rockbuds and vines, and\nstartled a pack of cremlings as he landed, sending them scuttling away from\na nearly clean mink skeleton. Probably the leavings of a larger predator.\n“Hmmm,” Syl said. “I would be an excellent mother. I’d teach the little\nspren to fly, to coast the winds, to harass you.…”\nKaladin smiled. “You’d get distracted by an interesting beetle and fly off,\nleaving them in a drawer somewhere.”\n“Nonsense! Why would I leave my babies in a drawer? Far too boring. A\nhighprince’s shoe though…”\nHe flew the remaining distance to the village, and the sight of broken\nbuildings at the western edge dampened his mood. Though the destruction\ncontinued to be less than he’d feared, every town or village had lost people\nto the winds or the terrible lightning.\nThis village—Hornhollow, the map called it—was in what once would\nhave been considered an ideal location. The land here dipped into a\ndepression, and a hill to the east cut the brunt of the highstorms. It held\nabout two dozen structures, including two large storm sanctuaries where\ntravelers could stay—but there were also many outer buildings. This was\nthe highprince’s land, and an industrious darkeyes of high enough nahn\ncould get a commission to work an unused hill out by itself, then keep a\nportion of the crop.\nA few sphere lanterns gave light to the square, where people had\ngathered for a town meeting.

Syl formed there by unspoken\ncommand, taking the shape of a Shardblade: a sleek, beautiful sword with\nthe symbol of the Windrunners prominent on the center, with lines\nsweeping off it toward the hilt—grooves in the metal that looked like\nflowing tresses of hair. Though Kaladin preferred a spear, the Blade was a\nsymbol.\nKaladin hit the ground in the center of the village, near its large central\ncistern, used to catch rainwater and filter away the crem. He rested the\nSylblade on his shoulder and stretched out his other hand, preparing his\nspeech. People of Hornhollow. I am Kaladin, of the Knights Radiant. I have\ncome—\n“Lord Radiant!” A portly lighteyed man stumbled out of the crowd,\nwearing a long raincloak and a wide-brimmed hat. He looked ridiculous,\nbut it was the Weeping. Constant rain didn’t exactly encourage heights of\nfashion.\nThe man clapped his hands in an energetic motion, and a pair of ardents\nstumbled up beside him, bearing goblets full of glowing spheres. Around\nthe perimeter of the square, people hissed and whispered, anticipationspren\nflapping in an unseen wind. Several men held up small children to get a\nbetter look.\n“Great,” Kaladin said softly. “I’ve become a menagerie act.”\nIn his mind, he heard Syl giggle.\nWell, best to put on a good show of it. He lifted the Sylblade high\noverhead, prompting a cheer from the crowd. He would have bet that most\nof the people in this square used to curse the name of the Radiants, but none\nof that was manifest now in the people’s enthusiasm. It was hard to believe\nthat centuries of mistrust and vilification would be forgotten so quickly. But\nwith the sky breaking and the land in turmoil, people would look to a\nsymbol.\nKaladin lowered his Blade. He knew all too well the danger of symbols.\nAmaram had been one to him, long ago.\n“You knew of my coming,” Kaladin said to the citylord and the ardents.\n“You’ve been in contact with your neighbors. Have they told you what I’ve\nbeen saying?”\n“Yes, Brightlord,” the lighteyed man said, gesturing eagerly for him to\ntake the spheres. As he did so—replacing them with spent ones he’d traded\nfor previously—the man’s expression fell noticeably.\nExpected me to pay two for one as I did at the first few towns, did you?\nKaladin thought with amusement. Well, he dropped a few extra dun spheres\nin. He’d rather be known as generous, particularly if it helped word spread,\nbut he couldn’t halve his spheres each time he went through them.\n“This is good,” Kaladin said, fishing out a few small gemstones. “I can’t\nvisit every holding in the area. I need you to send messages to each nearby\nvillage, carrying words of comfort and command from the king. I will pay\nfor the time of your runners.”\nHe looked out at the sea of eager faces, and couldn’t help but remember\na similar day in Hearthstone where he and the rest of the townspeople had"

Or would you rather visit the location of the attack\nimmediately?”\n“Attack?” Kaladin said, feeling a spike of alarm.\n“Yes, Brightlord,” the portly lighteyes said. “Isn’t that why you’re here?\nTo see where the rogue parshmen assaulted us?”\nFinally! “Take me there. Now.”\n* * *\nThey’d attacked a grain storage just outside town. Squashed between two\nhills and shaped like a dome, it had weathered the Everstorm without so\nmuch as a loosed stone. That made it a particular shame that the\nVoidbringers had ripped open the door and pillaged what was inside.\nKaladin knelt within, flipping over a broken hinge. The building smelled\nof dust and tallew, but was too wet. Townspeople who would suffer a dozen\nleaks in their bedroom would go to great expense to keep their grain dry.\nIt felt odd to not have the rain on his head, though he could still hear it\npattering outside.\n“May I continue, Brightlord?” the ardent asked him. She was young,\npretty, and nervous. Obviously she didn’t know where he fit into the scheme\nof her religion. The Knights Radiant had been founded by the Heralds, but\nthey were also traitors. So … he was either a divine being of myth or a\ncretin one step above a Voidbringer.\n“Yes, please,” Kaladin said.\n“Of the five eyewitnesses,” the ardent said, “four, um, independently\ncounted the number of attackers at … fifty or so? Anyway, it’s safe to say\nthat they’ve got large numbers, considering how many sacks of grain they\nwere able to carry away in such a short time. They, um, didn’t look exactly\nlike parshmen. Too tall, and wearing armor. The sketch I made … Um…”\nShe tried showing him her sketch again. It wasn’t much better than a\nchild’s drawing: a bunch of scribbles in vaguely humanoid shapes.\n“Anyway,” the young ardent continued, oblivious to the fact that Syl had\nlanded on her shoulder and was inspecting her face. “They attacked right\nafter first moonset. They had the grain out by middle of second moon, um,\nand we didn’t hear anything until the change of guard happened. Sot raised\nthe alarm, and that chased the creatures off. They only left four sacks,\nwhich we moved.”\nKaladin took a crude wooden cudgel off the table next to the ardent. The\nardent glanced at him, then quickly looked back to her paper, blushing. The\nroom, lit by oil lamps, was depressingly hollow. This grain should have\ngotten the village to the next harvest.\nTo a man from a farming village, nothing was more distressing than an\nempty silo at planting time.\n“The men who were attacked?” Kaladin said, inspecting the cudgel,\nwhich the Voidbringers had dropped while fleeing."

They could have slaughtered everyone and taken whatever\nthey wished; instead, they’d made a surgical raid.\n“The red lights,” Kaladin said. “Describe them again.”\nThe ardent started; she’d been looking at him. “Um, all five witnesses\nmentioned the lights, Brightlord. There were several small glowing red\nlights in the darkness.”\n“Their eyes.”\n“Maybe?” the ardent said. “If those were eyes, it was only a few. I went\nand asked, and none of the witnesses specifically saw eyes glowing—and\nKhem got a look right in one of the parshmen’s faces as they struck him.”\nKaladin dropped the cudgel and dusted off his palms. He took the sheet\nwith the picture on it out of the young ardent’s hands and inspected it, just\nfor show, then nodded to her. “You did well.

He nodded to the woman and left her,\nstriking back into the rain toward the center of town.\nSyl zipped up to his shoulder. “Wow. She must be desperate living out\nhere. I mean, look at you. Hair that hasn’t been combed since you flew\nacross the continent, uniform stained with crem, and that beard.”\n“Thank you for the boost of confidence.”\n“I guess when there’s nobody about but farmers, your standards really\ndrop.”\n“She’s an ardent,” Kaladin said. “She’d have to marry another ardent.”\n“I don’t think she was thinking about marriage, Kaladin…” Syl said,\nturning and looking backward over her shoulder. “I know you’ve been busy\nlately fighting guys in white clothing and stuff, but I’ve been doing\nresearch. People lock their doors, but there’s plenty of room to get in\nunderneath. I figured, since you don’t seem inclined to do any learning\nyourself, I should study. So if you have questions…”\n“I’m well aware of what is involved.”\n“You sure?” Syl asked. “Maybe we could have that ardent draw you a\npicture.

Some might be. I know a\nlot who aren’t.”\n“Come on,” Syl said. “What about that Lightweaver?

It’s not a mark of bad character to have\nbonded one of the weapons.”\n“Yes, well, let’s have someone swing around the corpse of your sisters\nby the feet, and we’ll see whether you consider it a ‘mark of bad character’\nor not. This is a distraction. Like that Lightweaver could be for you…”\n“Shallan’s a lighteyes,” Kaladin said. “That’s the end of the\nconversation.”\n“But—”\n“End,” he said, stepping into the home of the village lighteyes. Then he\nadded under his breath, “And stop spying on people when they’re being\nintimate. It’s creepy.”\nThe way she spoke, she expected to be there when Kaladin … Well, he’d\nnever considered that before, though she went with him everywhere else.\nCould he convince her to wait outside? She’d still listen, if not sneak in to\nwatch. Stormfather. His life just kept getting stranger. He tried—\nunsuccessfully—to banish the image of lying in bed with a woman, Syl\nsitting on the headboard and shouting out encouragement and advice.…\n“Lord Radiant?” the citylord asked from inside the front room of the\nsmall home. “Are you well?”\n“Painful memory,” Kaladin said. “Your scouts are certain of the direction\nthe parshmen went?”\nThe citylord looked over his shoulder at a scraggly man in leathers, bow\non his back, standing by the boarded-up window. Trapper, with a writ from\nthe local highlord to catch mink on his lands. “Followed them half a day\nout, Brightlord. They never deviated. Straight toward Kholinar, I’d swear to\nKelek himself.”\n“Then that’s where I’m going as well,” Kaladin said.\n“You want me to lead you, Brightlord Radiant?” the trapper asked.\nKaladin drew in Stormlight. “Afraid you’d just slow me down.” He\nnodded to the men, then stepped out and Lashed himself upward.

        "text": "ordinary Shin Thoroughbreds. Expensive, yes. But by definition, therefore,\nnot priceless.\nNot like the creature before him now.\nThey were housing the Kholin livestock in the far northwest section of\nthe tower, on the ground floor, near where winds from outside blew along\nthe mountains. Some clever constructions in the hallways by the royal\nengineers had ventilated the scents away from the inner corridors, though\nthat left the region quite chilly.\nGumfrems and hogs clogged some rooms, while conventional horses\nstabled in others. Several even contained Bashin’s axehounds, animals who\nnever got to go on hunts anymore.\nSuch accommodations weren’t good enough for the Blackthorn’s horse.\nNo, the massive black Ryshadium stallion had been given his own field.\nLarge enough to serve as a pasture, it was open to the sky and in an\nenviable spot, if you discounted the scents of the other animals.\nAs Adolin emerged from the tower, the black monster of a horse came\ngalloping over. Big enough to carry a Shardbearer without looking small,\nRyshadium were often called the “third Shard.” Blade, Plate, and Mount.\nThat didn’t do them justice. You couldn’t earn a Ryshadium simply by\ndefeating someone in combat. They chose their riders.\nBut, Adolin thought as Gallant nuzzled his hand, I suppose that was how\nit used to be with Blades too. They were spren who chose their bearers.\n“Hey,” Adolin said, scratching the Ryshadium’s snout with his left hand.\n“A little lonely out here, isn’t it? I’m sorry about that. Wish you weren’t\nalone any—” He cut off as his voice caught in his throat.\nGallant stepped closer, towering over him, but somehow still gentle. The\nhorse nuzzled Adolin’s neck, then blew out sharply.\n“Ugh,” Adolin said, turning the horse’s head. “That’s a scent I could do\nwithout.” He patted Gallant’s neck, then reached with his right hand into his\nshoulder pack—before a sharp pain from his wrist reminded him yet again\nof his wound. He reached in with the other hand and took out some sugar\nlumps, which Gallant consumed eagerly.\n“You’re as bad as Aunt Navani,” Adolin noted. “That’s why you came\nrunning, isn’t it? You smelled treats.”\nThe horse turned his head, looking at Adolin with one watery blue eye,\nrectangular pupil at the center. He almost seemed … offended.\nAdolin often had felt he could read his own Ryshadium’s emotions.\nThere had been a … bond between him and Sureblood. More delicate and\nindefinable than the bond between man and sword, but still there.\nOf course, Adolin was the one who talked to his sword sometimes, so he\nhad a habit of this sort of thing.\n“I’m sorry,” Adolin said. “I know the two of you liked to run together.\nAnd … I don’t know if Father will be able to get down as much to see you.\nHe’d already been withdrawing from battle before he got all these new\nresponsibilities. I thought I’d stop by once in a while.”\nThe horse snorted loudly.\n“Not to ride you,” Adolin said, reading indignation in the Ryshadium’s"

        "text": "responsibilities. I thought I’d stop by once in a while.”\nThe horse snorted loudly.\n“Not to ride you,” Adolin said, reading indignation in the Ryshadium’s\nmotions. “I just thought it might be nice for both of us.”\nThe horse poked his snout at Adolin’s satchel until he dug out another\nsugar cube. It seemed like agreement to Adolin, who fed the horse, then\nleaned back against the wall and watched him gallop through the pasture.\nShowing off, Adolin thought with amusement as Gallant pranced past\nhim. Maybe Gallant would let him brush his coat. That would feel good,\nlike the evenings he’d spent with Sureblood in the dark calm of the stables.\nAt least, that was what he’d done before everything had gotten busy, with\nShallan and the duels and everything else.\nHe’d ignored the horse right up until he’d needed Sureblood in battle.\nAnd then, in a flash of light, he was gone.\nAdolin took a deep breath. Everything seemed insane these days. Not\njust Sureblood, but what he’d done to Sadeas, and now the investigation …\nWatching Gallant seemed to help a little. Adolin was still there, leaning\nagainst the wall, when Renarin arrived. The younger Kholin poked his head\nthrough the doorway, looking around. He didn’t shy away when Gallant\ngalloped past, but he did regard the stallion with wariness.\n“Hey,” Adolin said from the side.\n“Hey. Bashin said you were down here.”\n“Just checking on Gallant,” Adolin said. “Because Father’s been so busy\nlately.”\nRenarin approached. “You could ask Shallan to draw Sureblood,”\nRenarin said. “I bet, um, she’d be able to do a good job. To remember.”\nIt wasn’t a bad suggestion, actually. “Were you looking for me, then?”\n“I…” Renarin watched Gallant as the horse pranced by again. “He’s\nexcited.”\n“He likes an audience.”\n“They don’t fit, you know.”\n“Don’t fit?”\n“Ryshadium have stone hooves,” Renarin said, “stronger than ordinary\nhorses’. Never need to be shod.”\n“And that makes them not fit? I’d say that makes them fit better.…”\nAdolin eyed Renarin. “You mean ordinary horses, don’t you?”\nRenarin blushed, then nodded. People had trouble following him\nsometimes, but that was merely because he tended to be so thoughtful. He’d\nbe thinking about something deep, something brilliant, and then would only\nmention a part. It made him seem erratic, but once you got to know him,\nyou realized he wasn’t trying to be esoteric. His lips just sometimes failed\nto keep up with his brain.\n“Adolin,” he said softly. “I … um … I have to give you back the\nShardblade you won for me.”\n“Why?” Adolin said.\n“It hurts to hold,” Renarin said. “It always has, to be honest. I thought it\nwas just me, being strange. But it’s all of us.”\n“Radiants, you mean.”\nHe nodded. “We can’t use the dead Blades. It’s not right.”"

It’s not right.”\n“Well, I suppose I could find someone else to use it,” Adolin said,\nrunning through options. “Though you should really be the one to choose.\nBy right of bestowal, the Blade is yours, and you should pick the\nsuccessor.”\n“I’d rather you do it. I’ve given it to the ardents already, for\nsafekeeping.”\n“Which means you’ll be unarmed,” Adolin said.\nRenarin glanced away.\n“Or not,” Adolin said, then poked Renarin in the shoulder. “You’ve got a\nreplacement already, don’t you.”\nRenarin blushed again.\n“You mink!” Adolin said. “You’ve managed to create a Radiant Blade?\nWhy didn’t you tell us?”\n“It just happened. Glys wasn’t certain he could do it … but we need\nmore people to work the Oathgate … so…”\nHe took a deep breath, then stretched his hand to the side and summoned\na long glowing Shardblade. Thin, with almost no crossguard, it had waving\nfolds to the metal, like it had been forged.\n“Gorgeous,” Adolin said. “Renarin, it’s fantastic!”\n“Thanks.”\n“So why are you embarrassed?”\n“I’m … not?”\nAdolin gave him a flat stare.\nRenarin dismissed the Blade. “I simply … Adolin, I was starting to fit in.\nWith Bridge Four, with being a Shardbearer. Now, I’m in the darkness\nagain. Father expects me to be a Radiant, so I can help him unite the world.\nBut how am I supposed to learn?”\nAdolin scratched his chin with his good hand. “Huh. I assumed that it\njust kind of came to you. It hasn’t?”\n“Some has. But it … frightens me, Adolin.” He held up his hand, and it\nstarted to glow, wisps of Stormlight trailing off it, like smoke from a fire.\n“What if I hurt someone, or ruin things?”\n“You’re not going to,” Adolin said. “Renarin, that’s the power of the\nAlmighty himself.”\nRenarin only stared at that glowing hand, and didn’t seem convinced. So\nAdolin reached out with his good hand and took Renarin’s, holding it.\n“This is good,” Adolin said to him. “You’re not going to hurt anyone.\nYou’re here to save us.”\nRenarin looked to him, then smiled. A pulse of Radiance washed through\nAdolin, and for an instant he saw himself perfected. A version of himself\nthat was somehow complete and whole, the man he could be.\nIt was gone in a moment, and Renarin pulled his hand free and\nmurmured an apology. He mentioned again the Shardblade needing to be\ngiven away, then fled back into the tower.\nAdolin stared after him. Gallant trotted up and nudged him for more\nsugar, so he reached absently into his satchel and fed the horse.\nOnly after Gallant trotted off did Adolin realize he’d used his right hand.\nHe held it up, amazed, moving his fingers.\nHis wrist had been completely healed.\n11.

The Rift\nTHIRTY-THREE YEARS AGO\nDalinar danced from one foot to the other in the morning mist, feeling a\nnew power, an energy in every step. Shardplate. His own Shardplate.\nThe world would never be the same place. They’d all expected he would\nsomeday have his own Plate or Blade, but he’d never been able to quiet the\nwhisper of uncertainty from the back of his mind. What if it never\nhappened?\nBut it had. Stormfather, it had. He’d won it himself, in combat. Yes, that\ncombat had involved kicking a man off a cliff, but he’d defeated a\nShardbearer regardless.\nHe couldn’t help but bask in how grand it felt.\n“Calm, Dalinar,” Sadeas said from beside him in the mist. Sadeas wore\nhis own golden Plate. “Patience.”\n“It won’t do any good, Sadeas,” Gavilar—clad in bright blue Plate—said\nfrom Dalinar’s other side. All three of them wore their faceplates up for the\nmoment. “The Kholin boys are chained axehounds, and we smell blood. We\ncan’t go into battle breathing calming breaths, centered and serene, as the\nardents teach.”\nDalinar shifted, feeling the cold morning fog on his face. He wanted to\ndance with the anticipationspren whipping in the air around him. Behind,\nthe army waited in disciplined ranks, their footsteps, clinkings, coughs, and\nmurmured banter rising through the fog.\nHe almost felt as if he didn’t need that army. He wore a massive hammer\non his back, so heavy an unaided man—even the strongest of them—\nwouldn’t be able to lift it. He barely noticed the weight. Storms, this power.\nIt felt remarkably like the Thrill.\n“Have you given thought to my suggestion, Dalinar?” Sadeas asked.\n“No.”\nSadeas sighed.\n“If Gavilar commands me,” Dalinar said, “I’ll marry.”\n“Don’t bring me into this,” Gavilar said. He summoned and dismissed\nhis Shardblade repeatedly as they talked.\n“Well,” Dalinar said, “until you say something, I’m staying single.” The\nonly woman he’d ever wanted belonged to Gavilar. They’d married—\nstorms, they had a child now. A little girl.\nHis brother must never know how Dalinar felt.\n“But think of the benefit, Dalinar,” Sadeas said. “Your wedding could\nbring us alliances, Shards. Perhaps you could win us a princedom—one we\nwouldn’t have to storming drive to the brink of collapse before they join\nus!”\nAfter two years of fighting, only four of the ten princedoms had accepted\nGavilar’s rule—and two of those, Kholin and Sadeas, had been easy. The\nresult was a united Alethkar: against House Kholin.\nGavilar was convinced that he could play them off one another, that their\nnatural selfishness would lead them to stab one another in the back.

        "text": "in turn, pushed Gavilar toward greater brutality. He claimed that the fiercer\ntheir reputation, the more cities would turn to them willingly rather than\nrisk being pillaged.\n“Well?” Sadeas asked. “Will you at least consider a union of political\nnecessity?”\n“Storms, you still on that?” Dalinar said. “Let me fight. You and my\nbrother can worry about politics.”\n“You can’t escape this forever, Dalinar. You realize that, right? We’ll\nhave to worry about feeding the darkeyes, about city infrastructure, about\nties with other kingdoms. Politics.”\n“You and Gavilar,” Dalinar said.\n“All of us,” Sadeas said. “All three.”\n“Weren’t you trying to get me to relax?” Dalinar snapped. Storms.\nThe rising sun finally started to disperse the fog, and that let him see\ntheir target: a wall about twelve feet high. Beyond that, nothing. A flat rocky\nexpanse, or so it appeared. The chasm city was difficult to spot from this\ndirection. Named Rathalas, it was also known as the Rift: an entire city that\nhad been built inside a rip in the ground.\n“Brightlord Tanalan is a Shardbearer, right?” Dalinar asked.\nSadeas sighed, lowering his faceplate. “We only went over this four\ntimes, Dalinar.”\n“I was drunk. Tanalan. Shardbearer?”\n“Blade only, Brother,” Gavilar said.\n“He’s mine,” Dalinar whispered.\nGavilar laughed. “Only if you find him first! I’ve half a mind to give that\nBlade to Sadeas. At least he listens in our meetings.”\n“All right,” Sadeas said. “Let’s do this carefully. Remember the plan.\nGavilar, you—”\nGavilar gave Dalinar a grin, slammed his faceplate down, then took off\nrunning to leave Sadeas midsentence. Dalinar whooped and joined him,\nPlated boots grinding against stone.\nSadeas cursed loudly, then followed. The army remained behind for the\nmoment.\nRocks started falling; catapults from behind the wall hurled solitary\nboulders or sprays of smaller rocks. Chunks slammed down around Dalinar,\nshaking the ground, causing rockbud vines to curl up. A boulder struck just\nahead, then bounced, spraying chips of stone. Dalinar skidded past it, the\nPlate lending a spring to his motion. He raised his arm before his eye slit as\na hail of arrows darkened the sky.\n“Watch the ballistas!” Gavilar shouted.\nAtop the wall, soldiers aimed massive crossbowlike devices mounted to\nthe stone. One sleek bolt—the size of a spear—launched directly at Dalinar,\nand it proved far more accurate than the catapults. He threw himself to the\nside, Plate grinding on stone as he slid out of the way. The bolt hit the\nground with such force that the wood shattered.\nOther shafts trailed netting and ropes, hoping to trip a Shardbearer and\nrender him prone for a second shot. Dalinar grinned, feeling the Thrill\nawaken within him, and recovered his feet. He leaped over a bolt trailing\nnetting.\nTanalan’s men delivered a storm of wood and stone, but it wasn’t nearly"

Dalinar took a stone in the shoulder and lurched, but quickly\nregained his momentum. Arrows were useless against him, the boulders too\nrandom, and the ballistas too slow to reload.\nThis was how it should be. Dalinar, Gavilar, Sadeas. Together. Other\nresponsibilities didn’t matter. Life was about the fight. A good battle in the\nday—then at night, a warm hearth, tired muscles, and a good vintage of\nwine.\nDalinar reached the squat wall and leaped, propelling himself in a\nmighty jump. He gained just enough height to grab one of the crenels of the\nwall’s top. Men raised hammers to pound his fingers, but he hurled himself\nover the lip and onto the wall walk, crashing down amid panicked\ndefenders. He jerked the release rope on his hammer—dropping it on an\nenemy behind—then swung out with his fist, sending men broken and\nscreaming.\nThis was almost too easy! He seized his hammer, then brought it up and\nswung it in a wide arc, tossing men from the wall like leaves before a gust\nof wind. Just beyond him, Sadeas kicked over a ballista, destroying the\ndevice with a casual blow. Gavilar attacked with his Blade, dropping\ncorpses by the handful, their eyes burning. Up here, the fortification worked\nagainst the defenders, leaving them cramped and clumped up—perfect for\nShardbearers to destroy.\nDalinar surged through them, and in a few moments likely killed more\nmen than he had in his entire life. At that, he felt a surprising yet profound\ndissatisfaction. This was not about his skill, his momentum, or even his\nreputation. You could have replaced him with a toothless gaffer and\nproduced practically the same result.\nHe gritted his teeth against that sudden useless emotion. He dug deeply\nwithin, and found the Thrill waiting. It filled him, driving away\ndissatisfaction. Within moments he was roaring his pleasure. Nothing these\nmen did could touch him. He was a destroyer, a conqueror, a glorious\nmaelstrom of death. A god.\nSadeas was saying something. The silly man gestured in his golden\nShardplate. Dalinar blinked, looking out over the wall. He could see the Rift\nproper from this vantage, a deep chasm in the ground that hid an entire city,\nbuilt up the sides of either cliff.\n“Catapults, Dalinar!” Sadeas said. “Bring down those catapults!”\nRight. Gavilar’s armies had started to charge the walls. Those catapults\n—near the way down into the Rift proper—were still launching stones, and\nwould drop hundreds of men.\nDalinar leaped for the edge of the wall and grabbed a rope ladder to\nswing down. The ropes, of course, immediately snapped, sending him\ntoppling to the ground. He struck with a crash of Plate on stone. It didn’t\nhurt, but his pride took a serious blow. Above, Sadeas looked at him over\nthe edge. Dalinar could practically hear his voice.\nAlways rushing into things. Take some time to think once in a while,"

Take some time to think once in a while,\nwon’t you?\nThat had been a flat-out greenvine mistake. Dalinar growled and climbed\nto his feet, searching for his hammer. Storms! He’d bent the handle in his\nfall. How had he done that? It wasn’t made of the same strange metal as\nBlades and Plate, but it was still good steel.\nSoldiers guarding the catapults swarmed toward him while the shadows\nof boulders passed overhead. Dalinar set his jaw, the Thrill saturating him,\nand reached for a stout wooden door set into the wall nearby. He ripped it\nfree, the hinges popping, and stumbled. It came off more easily than he’d\nexpected.\nThere was more to this armor than he’d ever imagined. Maybe he wasn’t\nany better with the Plate than some old gaffer, but he would change that. At\nthat moment, he determined that he’d never be surprised again. He’d wear\nthis Plate morning and night—he’d sleep in the storming stuff—until he\nwas more comfortable in it than out.\nHe raised the wooden door and swung it like a bludgeon, sweeping\nsoldiers away and opening a path to the catapults. Then he dashed forward\nand grabbed the side of one catapult. He ripped its wheel off, splintering\nwood and sending the machine teetering. He stepped onto it, grabbing the\ncatapult’s arm and breaking it free.\nOnly ten more to go. He stood atop the wrecked machine when he heard\na distant voice call his name. “Dalinar!”\nHe looked toward the wall, where Sadeas reached back and heaved his\nShardbearer’s hammer. It spun in the air before slamming into the catapult\nnext to Dalinar, wedging itself into the broken wood.\nSadeas raised a hand in salute, and Dalinar waved back in gratitude, then\ngrabbed the hammer. The destruction went a lot faster after that. He\npounded the machines, leaving behind shattered wood. Engineers—many of\nthem women—scrambled away, screaming, “Blackthorn, Blackthorn!”\nBy the time he neared the last catapult, Gavilar had secured the gates and\nopened them to his soldiers. A flood of men entered, joining those who had\nscaled the walls. The last of the enemies near Dalinar fled down into the\ncity, leaving him alone. He grunted and kicked the final broken catapult,\nsending it rolling backward across the stone toward the edge of the Rift.\nIt tipped, then fell over. Dalinar stepped forward, walking onto a kind of\nobservation post, a section of rock with a railing to prevent people from\nslipping over the side. From this vantage, he got his first good look down at\nthe city.\n“The Rift” was a fitting name. To his right, the chasm narrowed, but here\nat the middle he’d have been hard-pressed to throw a stone across to the\nother side, even with Shardplate. And within it, there was life. Gardens\nbobbing with lifespren. Buildings built practically on top of one another\ndown the V-shaped cliff sides. The place teemed with a network of stilts,\nbridges, and wooden walkways."

The place teemed with a network of stilts,\nbridges, and wooden walkways.\nDalinar turned and looked back at the wall that ran in a wide circle\naround the opening of the Rift on all sides except the west, where the\ncanyon continued until it opened up below at the shores of the lake.\nTo survive in Alethkar, you had to find shelter from the storms. A wide\ncleft like this one was perfect for a city. But how did you protect it? Any\nattacking enemy would have the high ground. Many cities walked a risky\nline between security from storms and security from men.\nDalinar shouldered Sadeas’s hammer as groups of Tanalan’s soldiers\nflooded down from the walls, forming up to flank Gavilar’s army on both\nright and left. They’d try to press against the Kholin troops from both sides,\nbut with three Shardbearers to face, they were in trouble. Where was\nHighlord Tanalan himself?\nBehind, Thakka approached with a small squad of elites, joining Dalinar\non the stone viewing platform. Thakka put his hands on the railing,\nwhistling softly.\n“Something’s going on with this city,” Dalinar said.\n“What?”\n“I don’t know.…” Dalinar might not pay attention to the grand plans\nGavilar and Sadeas made, but he was a soldier. He knew battlefields like a\nwoman knew her mother’s recipes: he might not be able to give you\nmeasurements, but he could taste when something was off.\nThe fighting continued behind him, Kholin soldiers clashing with\nTanalan’s defenders. Tanalan’s armies didn’t fare well; demoralized by the\nadvancing Kholin army, the enemy ranks quickly broke and scrambled into\na retreat, clogging the ramps down into the city. Gavilar and Sadeas didn’t\ngive chase; they had the high ground now. No need to rush into a potential\nambush.\nGavilar clomped across the stone, Sadeas beside him. They’d want to\nsurvey the city and rain arrows upon those below—maybe even use stolen\ncatapults, if Dalinar had left any functional. They’d siege this place until it\nbroke.\nThree Shardbearers, Dalinar thought. Tanalan has to be planning to deal\nwith us somehow.…\nThis viewing platform was the best vantage for looking into the city. And\nthey’d situated the catapults right next to it—machines that the\nShardbearers were certain to attack and disable. Dalinar glanced to the\nsides, and saw cracks in the stone floor of the viewing platform.\n“No!” Dalinar shouted to Gavilar. “Stay back! It’s a—”\nThe enemy must have been watching, for the moment he shouted, the\nground fell out from beneath him. Dalinar caught a glimpse of Gavilar—\nheld back by Sadeas—looking on in horror as Dalinar, Thakka, and a\nhandful of other elites were toppled into the Rift.\nStorms.

Everything spun around him.\nA moment later, he crashed into a building with an awful crunch.\nSomething hard hit his arm, an impact so powerful he heard his armor there\nshatter.\nThe building failed to stop him. He tore right through the wood and\ncontinued, helm grinding against stone as he somehow came in contact with\nthe side of the Rift.\nHe hit another surface with a loud crunch, and blessedly here he finally\nstopped.

The large section of falling rock\nhad torn a swath through the city along the steep incline, smashing homes\nand walkways. Dalinar had been flung just to the north, and had eventually\ncome to rest on the wooden roof of a building.\nHe didn’t see signs of his men. Thakka, the other elites. But without\nShardplate … He growled, angerspren boiling around him like pools of\nblood. He shifted on the rooftop, but the pain in his hand made him wince.\nHis armor all down his left arm had shattered, and in falling he appeared to\nhave broken a few fingers.\nHis Shardplate leaked glowing white smoke from a hundred fractures,\nbut the only pieces he’d lost completely were from his left arm and hand.\nHe gingerly pried himself from the rooftop, but as he shifted, he broke\nthrough and fell into the home. He grunted as he hit, members of a family\nscreaming and pulling back against the wall. Tanalan apparently hadn’t told\nthe people of his plan to crush a section of his own city in a desperate\nattempt to deal with the enemy Shardbearers.\nDalinar got to his feet, ignoring the cowering people, and shoved open\nthe door—breaking it with the strength of his push—and stepped out onto a\nwooden walkway that ran before the homes on this tier of the city.\nA hail of arrows immediately fell on him. He turned his right shoulder\ntoward them, growling, shielding his eye slit as best he could while he\ninspected the source of the attack. Fifty archers were set up on a garden\nplatform on the other storming side of the Rift from him. Wonderful.\nHe recognized the man leading the archers. Tall, with an imperious\nbearing and stark white plumes on his helm. Who put chicken feathers on\ntheir helms? Looked ridiculous. Well, Tanalan was a fine enough fellow.\nDalinar had beat him once at pawns, and Tanalan had paid the bet with a\nhundred glowing bits of ruby, each dropped into a corked bottle of wine.\nDalinar had always found that amusing.\nReveling in the Thrill, which rose in him and drove away pain, Dalinar\ncharged along the walkway, ignoring arrows. Above, Sadeas was leading a\nforce down one of the ramps outside the path of the rockfall, but it would be\nslow going. By the time they arrived, Dalinar intended to have a new\nShardblade.\nHe charged onto one of the bridges that crossed the Rift.

Sure\nenough, a pair of soldiers hurried down the other side of the Rift, then used\naxes to attack the support posts to Dalinar’s bridge. It had Soulcast metal\nropes holding it up, but if they could get those posts down—dropping the\nlines—his weight would surely cause the entire thing to fall.\nThe bottom wash of the Rift was easily another hundred feet below.\nGrowling, Dalinar made the only choice he could. He threw himself over\nthe side of his walkway, dropping a short distance to one below. It looked\nsturdy enough. Even so, one foot smashed through the wooden planks,\nnearly followed by his entire body.\nHe heaved himself up and continued running across. Two more soldiers\nreached the posts holding up this bridge, and they began frantically hacking\naway.\nThe walkway shook beneath Dalinar’s feet. Stormfather. He didn’t have\nmuch time, but there were no more walkways within jumping distance.\nDalinar pushed himself to a run, roaring, his footfalls cracking boards.\nA single black arrow fell from above, swooping like a skyeel. It dropped\none of the soldiers. Another arrow followed, hitting the second soldier even\nas he gawked at his fallen ally. The walkway stopped shaking, and Dalinar\ngrinned, pulling to a stop. He turned, spotting a man standing near the\nsheared-off section of stone above. He lifted a black bow toward Dalinar.\n“Teleb, you storming miracle,” Dalinar said.\nHe reached the other side and plucked an axe from the hands of a dead\nman. Then he charged up a ramp toward where he’d seen Highlord Tanalan.\nHe found the place easily, a wide wooden platform built on struts\nconnected to parts of the wall below, and draped with vines and blooming\nrockbuds. Lifespren scattered as Dalinar reached it.\nCentered in the garden, Tanalan waited with a force of some fifty\nsoldiers. Puffing inside his helm, Dalinar stepped up to confront them.\nTanalan was armored in simple steel, no Shardplate, though a brutal-looking\nShardblade—wide, with a hooked tip—appeared in his grasp.\nTanalan barked for his soldiers to stand back and lower their bows. Then\nhe strode toward Dalinar, holding the Shardblade with both hands.\nEveryone always fixated upon Shardblades. Specific weapons had lore\ndedicated to them, and people traced which kings or brightlords had carried\nwhich sword. Well, Dalinar had used both Blade and Plate, and if given the\nchoice of one, he’d pick Plate every time. All he needed to do was get in\none solid hit on Tanalan, and the fight would be over. The highlord,\nhowever, had to contend with a foe who could resist his blows.\nThe Thrill thrummed inside Dalinar. Standing between two squat trees,\nhe set his stance, keeping his exposed left arm pointed away from the\nhighlord while gripping the axe in his gauntleted right hand. Though it was\na war axe, it felt like a child’s plaything.\n“You should not have come here, Dalinar,” Tanalan said. His voice bore"

His voice bore\na distinctively nasal accent common to this region. The Rifters always had\nconsidered themselves a people apart. “We had no quarrel with you or\nyours.”\n“You refused to submit to the king,” Dalinar said, armor plates clinking\nas he rounded the highlord while trying to keep an eye on the soldiers. He\nwouldn’t put it past them to attack him once he was distracted by the duel.\nIt was what he himself would have done.\n“The king?” Tanalan demanded, angerspren boiling up around him.\n“There hasn’t been a throne in Alethkar for generations. Even if we were to\nhave a king again, who is to say the Kholins deserve the mantle?”\n“The way I see it,” Dalinar said, “the people of Alethkar deserve a king\nwho is the strongest and most capable of leading them in battle. If only\nthere were a way to prove that.” He grinned inside his helm.\nTanalan attacked, sweeping in with his Shardblade and trying to leverage\nhis superior reach. Dalinar danced back, waiting for his moment. The Thrill\nwas a heady rush, a lust to prove himself.\nBut he needed to be cautious. Ideally Dalinar would prolong this fight,\nrelying on his Plate’s superior strength and the stamina it provided.\nUnfortunately, that Plate was still leaking, and he had all these guards to\ndeal with. Still, he tried to play it as Tanalan would expect, dodging attacks,\nacting as if he were going to drag out the fight.\nTanalan growled and came in again. Dalinar blocked the blow with his\narm, then made a perfunctory swing with his axe. Tanalan dodged back\neasily. Stormfather, that Blade was long. Almost as tall as Dalinar was.\nDalinar maneuvered, brushing against the foliage of the garden. He\ncouldn’t even feel the pain of his broken fingers anymore. The Thrill called\nto him.\nWait. Act like you’re drawing this out as long as possible.…\nTanalan advanced again, and Dalinar dodged backward, faster because of\nhis Plate. And then when Tanalan tried his next strike, Dalinar ducked\ntoward him.\nHe deflected the Shardblade with his arm again, but this blow hit hard,\nshattering the arm plate. Still, Dalinar’s surprise rush let him lower his\nshoulder and slam it against Tanalan. The highlord’s armor clanged,\nbending before the force of the Shardplate, and the highlord tripped.\nUnfortunately, Dalinar was off balance just enough from his rush to fall\nalongside the highlord. The platform shook as they hit the ground, the wood\ncracking and groaning. Damnation! Dalinar had not wanted to go to the\nground while surrounded by foes. Still, he had to stay inside the reach of\nthat Blade.\nDalinar dropped off his right gauntlet—without the arm piece connecting\nit to the rest of the armor, it was dead weight—as the two of them twisted in\na heap. He’d lost the axe, unfortunately. The highlord battered against\nDalinar with the pommel of his sword, to no effect. But with one hand"

But with one hand\nbroken and the other lacking the power of Plate, Dalinar couldn’t get a good\nhold on his foe.\nDalinar rolled, finally positioning himself above Tanalan, where the\nweight of the Shardplate would keep his foe pinned. At that moment\nthough, the other soldiers attacked. Just as he’d expected. Honorable duels\nlike this—on a battlefield at least—always lasted only until your lighteyes\nwas losing.\nDalinar rolled free. The soldiers obviously weren’t ready for how\nquickly he responded. He got to his feet and scooped up his axe, then lashed\nout. His right arm still had the pauldron and down to the elbow brace, so\nwhen he swung, he had power—a strange mix of Shard-enhanced strength\nand frailty from his exposed arms. He had to be careful not to snap his own\nwrist.\nHe dropped three men with a flurry of axe slices. The others backed\naway, blocking him with polearms as their fellows helped Tanalan to his\nfeet.\n“You speak of the people,” Tanalan said hoarsely, gauntleted hand\nfeeling at his chest where the cuirass had been bent significantly by\nDalinar’s rush. He seemed to be having trouble breathing. “As if this were\nabout them. As if it were for their good that you loot, you pillage, you\nmurder. You’re an uncivilized brute.”\n“You can’t civilize war,” Dalinar said. “There’s no painting it up and\nmaking it pretty.”\n“You don’t have to pull sorrow behind you like a sledge on the stones,\nscraping and crushing those you pass. You’re a monster.”\n“I’m a soldier,” Dalinar said, eyeing Tanalan’s men, many of whom were\npreparing their bows.\nTanalan coughed. “My city is lost. My plan has failed. But I can do\nAlethkar one last service. I can take you down, you bastard.”\nThe archers started to loose.\nDalinar roared and threw himself to the ground, hitting the platform with\nthe weight of Shardplate. The wood cracked around him, weakened by the\nfighting earlier, and he broke through it, shattering struts underneath.\nThe entire platform came crashing down around him, and together they\nfell toward the tier below. Dalinar heard screams, and he hit the next\nwalkway hard enough to daze him, even with Shardplate.\nDalinar shook his head, groaning, and found his helm cracked right\ndown the front, the uncommon vision granted by the armor spoiled. He\npulled the helm free with one hand and gasped for breath. Storms, his good\narm hurt too. He glanced at it and found splinters piercing his skin,\nincluding one chunk as long as a dagger.\nHe grimaced. Below, the few remaining soldiers who had been\npositioned to cut down bridges came charging up toward him.\nSteady, Dalinar. Be ready!\nHe got to his feet, dazed, exhausted, but the two soldiers didn’t come for\nhim. They huddled around Tanalan’s body where it had fallen from the\nplatform above.

His Plate moved slowly, and\nhe stumbled through the wreckage of the fallen platform, trying to keep up\nwith the soldiers.\nThe pain from his arms made him mad with rage. But the Thrill, the\nThrill drove him forward. He would not be beaten. He would not stop!\nTanalan’s Shardblade had not appeared beside his body. That meant his foe\nstill lived. Dalinar had not yet won.\nFortunately, most of the soldiers had been positioned to fight on the other\nside of the city. This side was practically empty, save for huddled\ntownspeople—he caught glimpses of them hiding in their homes.\nDalinar limped up ramps along the side of the Rift, following the men\ndragging their brightlord. Near the top, the two soldiers set their burden\ndown beside an exposed portion of the chasm’s rock wall. They did\nsomething that caused a portion of that wall to open inward, revealing a\nhidden door. They towed their fallen brightlord into it, and two other\nsoldiers—responding to their frantic calls—rushed out to meet Dalinar, who\narrived moments later.\nHelmless, Dalinar saw red as he engaged them. They bore weapons; he\ndid not. They were fresh, and he had wounds nearly incapacitating both\narms.\nThe fight still ended with the two soldiers on the ground, broken and\nbleeding. Dalinar kicked open the hidden door, Plated legs functioning\nenough to smash it down.\nHe lurched into a small tunnel with diamond spheres glowing on the\nwalls. That door was covered in hardened crem on the outside, making it\nseem like a part of the wall. If he hadn’t seen them enter, it would have\ntaken days, maybe weeks to locate this place.\nAt the end of a short walk, he found the two soldiers he’d followed.\nJudging by the blood trail, they’d deposited their brightlord in the closed\nroom behind them.\nThey rushed Dalinar with the fatalistic determination of men who knew\nthey were probably dead. The pain in Dalinar’s arms and head seemed\nnothing before the Thrill. He had rarely felt it so strong as he did now, a\nbeautiful clarity, such a wonderful emotion.\nHe ducked forward, supernaturally quick, and used his shoulder to crush\none soldier against the wall. The other fell to a well-placed kick, then\nDalinar burst through the door beyond them.\nTanalan lay on the ground here, blood surrounding him. A beautiful\nwoman was draped across him, weeping. Only one other person was in the\nsmall chamber: a young boy. Six, perhaps seven. Tears streaked the child’s\nface, and he struggled to lift his father’s Shardblade in two hands.\nDalinar loomed in the doorway.\n“You can’t have my daddy,” the boy said, words distorted by his sorrow.\nPainspren crawled around the floor. “You can’t. You … you…” His voice\nfell to a whisper. “Daddy said … we fight monsters. And with faith, we will\nwin.…”\n* * *\nA few hours later, Dalinar sat on the edge of the Rift, his legs swinging over\nthe broken city below. His new Shardblade rested across his lap, his Plate—"

His new Shardblade rested across his lap, his Plate—\ndeformed and broken—in a heap beside him. His arms were bandaged, but\nhe’d chased away the surgeons.\nHe stared out at what seemed an empty plain, then flicked his eyes\ntoward the signs of human life below. Dead bodies in heaps. Broken\nbuildings. Splinters of civilization.\nGavilar eventually walked up, trailed by two bodyguards from Dalinar’s\nelites, Kadash and Febin today. Gavilar waved them back, then groaned as\nhe settled down beside Dalinar, removing his helm. Exhaustionspren spun\noverhead, though—despite his fatigue—Gavilar looked thoughtful. With\nthose keen, pale green eyes, he’d always seemed to know so much.\nGrowing up, Dalinar had simply assumed that his brother would always be\nright in whatever he said or did. Aging hadn’t much changed his opinion of\nthe man.\n“Congratulations,” Gavilar said, nodding toward the Blade. “Sadeas is\nirate it wasn’t his.”\n“He’ll find one of his own eventually,” Dalinar said. “He’s too ambitious\nfor me to believe otherwise.”\nGavilar grunted. “This attack nearly cost us too much. Sadeas is saying\nwe need to be more careful, not risk ourselves and our Shards in solitary\nassaults.”\n“Sadeas is smart,” Dalinar said. He reached gingerly with his right hand,\nthe less mangled one, and raised a mug of wine to his lips. It was the only\ndrug he cared about for the pain—and maybe it would help with the shame\ntoo. Both feelings seemed stark, now that the Thrill had receded and left\nhim deflated.\n“What do we do with them, Dalinar?” Gavilar asked, waving down\ntoward the crowds of civilians the soldiers were rounding up. “Tens of\nthousands of people. They won’t be cowed easily; they won’t like that you\nkilled their highlord and his heir. Those people will resist us for years. I can\nfeel it.”\nDalinar took a drink. “Make soldiers of them,” he said. “Tell them we’ll\nspare their families if they fight for us. You want to stop doing a\nShardbearer rush at the start of battles? Sounds like we’ll need some\nexpendable troops.”\nGavilar nodded, considering. “Sadeas is right about other things too, you\nknow. About us. And what we’re going to have to become.”\n“Don’t talk to me about that.”\n“Dalinar…”\n“I lost half my elites today, my captain included. I’ve got enough\nproblems.”\n“Why are we here, fighting? Is it for honor? Is it for Alethkar?”\nDalinar shrugged.\n“We can’t just keep acting like a bunch of thugs,” Gavilar said. “We\ncan’t rob every city we pass, feast every night. We need discipline; we need\nto hold the land we have. We need bureaucracy, order, laws, politics.”\nDalinar closed his eyes, distracted by the shame he felt. What if Gavilar\nfound out?\n“We’re going to have to grow up,” Gavilar said softly."

Like these highlords we kill? That’s why we started,\nisn’t it? Because they were all lazy, fat, corrupt?”\n“I don’t know anymore. I’m a father now, Dalinar. That makes me\nwonder about what we do once we have it all. How do we make a kingdom\nof this place?”\nStorms. A kingdom. For the first time in his life, Dalinar found that idea\nhorrifying.\nGavilar eventually stood up, responding to some messengers who were\ncalling for him. “Could you,” he said to Dalinar, “at least try to be a little\nless foolhardy in future battles?”\n“This coming from you?”\n“A thoughtful me,” Gavilar said. “An … exhausted me. Enjoy\nOathbringer. You earned it.”\n“Oathbringer?”\n“Your sword,” Gavilar said. “Storms, didn’t you listen to anything last\nnight? That’s Sunmaker’s old sword.”\nSadees, the Sunmaker. He had been the last man to unite Alethkar,\ncenturies ago. Dalinar shifted the Blade in his lap, letting the light play off\nthe pristine metal.\n“It’s yours now,” Gavilar said. “By the time we’re done, I’ll have it so\nthat nobody even thinks of Sunmaker anymore. Just House Kholin and\nAlethkar.”\nHe walked away. Dalinar rammed the Shardblade into the stone and\nleaned back, closing his eyes again and remembering the sound of a brave\nboy crying.\n12. Negotiations\nI ask not that you forgive me. Nor that you even understand.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nDalinar stood beside the glass windows in an upper-floor room of Urithiru,\nhands clasped behind his back. He could see his reflection hinted in the\nwindow, and beyond it vast openness. The sky cloud-free, the sun burning\nwhite.\nWindows as tall as he was—he’d never seen anything like them. Who\nwould dare build something of glass, so brittle, and face it toward the\nstorms? But of course, this city was above the storms. These windows\nseemed a mark of defiance, a symbol of what the Radiants had meant. They\nhad stood above the pettiness of world politics. And because of that height,\nthey could see so far.…\nYou idealize them, said a distant voice in his head, like rumbling thunder.\nThey were men like you. No better. No worse.\n“I find that encouraging,” Dalinar whispered back. “If they were like us,\nthen it means we can be like them.”\nThey eventually betrayed us. Do not forget that.\n“Why?” Dalinar asked. “What happened? What changed them?”\nThe Stormfather fell silent.\n“Please,” Dalinar said. “Tell me.”\nSome things are better left forgotten, the voice said to him. You of all\nmen should understand this, considering the hole in your mind and the\nperson who once filled it.\nDalinar drew in a sharp breath, stung by the words.\n“Brightlord,” Brightness Kalami said from behind. “The emperor is\nready for you.”"

Urithiru’s upper levels held several unique rooms,\nincluding this amphitheater. Shaped like a half-moon, the room had\nwindows at the top—the straight side—then rows of seats leading down to a\nspeaking floor below. Curiously, each seat had a small pedestal beside it.\nFor the Radiant’s spren, the Stormfather told him.\nDalinar started down the steps toward his team: Aladar and his daughter,\nMay. Navani, wearing a bright green havah, sitting in the front row with\nfeet stretched out before her, shoes off and ankles crossed. Elderly Kalami\nto write, and Teshav Khal—one of Alethkar’s finest political minds—to\nadvise. Her two senior wards sat beside her, ready to provide research or\ntranslation if needed.\nA small group, prepared to change the world.\n“Send my greetings to the emperor,” Dalinar instructed.\nKalami nodded, writing. Then she cleared her throat, reading the\nresponse that the spanreed—writing as if on its own—relayed. “You are\ngreeted by His Imperial Majesty Ch.V.D. Yanagawn the First, Emperor of\nMakabak, King of Azir, Lord of the Bronze Palace, Prime Aqasix, grand\nminister and emissary of Yaezir.”\n“An imposing title,” Navani noted, “for a fifteen-year-old boy.”\n“He supposedly raised a child from the dead,” Teshav said, “a miracle\nthat gained him the support of the viziers. Local word is that they had\ntrouble finding a new Prime after the last two were murdered by our old\nfriend the Assassin in White. So the viziers picked a boy with questionable\nlineage and made up a story about him saving someone’s life in order to\ndemonstrate a divine mandate.”\nDalinar grunted. “Making things up doesn’t sound very Azish.”\n“They’re fine with it,” Navani said, “as long as you can find witnesses\nwilling to fill out affidavits. Kalami, thank His Imperial Majesty for meeting\nwith us, and his translators for their efforts.”\nKalami wrote, and then she looked up at Dalinar, who began to pace the\ncenter of the room. Navani stood to join him, eschewing her shoes, walking\nin socks.\n“Your Imperial Majesty,” Dalinar said, “I speak to you from the top of\nUrithiru, city of legend. The sights are breathtaking. I invite you to visit me\nhere and tour the city. You are welcome to bring any guards or retinue you\nsee fit.”\nHe looked to Navani, and she nodded. They’d discussed long how to\napproach the monarchs, and had settled on a soft invitation. Azir was first,\nthe most powerful country in the west and home to what would be the most\ncentral and important of the Oathgates to secure.\nThe response took time.

Scions were kind of like ardents,\nthough they weren’t slaves, which Dalinar found odd. In Azir, being a\npriest-minister in the government was the highest honor to which one could\naspire.\nTraditionally, the Azish Prime claimed to be emperor of all Makabak—a\nregion that included over a half-dozen kingdoms and princedoms. In reality,\nhe was king over only Azir, but Azir did cast a long, long shadow.\nAs they waited, Dalinar stepped up beside Navani, resting his fingers on\none of her shoulders, then drew them across her back, the nape of her neck,\nand let them linger on the other shoulder.\nWho would have thought a man his age could feel so giddy?\n“ ‘Your Highness,’ ” the reply finally came, Kalami reading the words. “\n‘We thank you for your warning about the storm that blew from the wrong\ndirection. Your timely words have been noted and recorded in the official\nannals of the empire, recognizing you as a friend to Azir.’ ”\nKalami waited for more, but the spanreed stopped moving. Then the\nruby flashed, indicating that they were done.\n“That wasn’t much of a response,” Aladar said. “Why didn’t he reply to\nyour invitation, Dalinar?”\n“Being noted in their official records is a great honor to the Azish,”\nTeshav said, “so they’ve paid you a compliment.”\n“Yes,” Navani said, “but they are trying to dodge the offer we made.\nPress them, Dalinar.”\n“Kalami, please send the following,” Dalinar said. “I am honored,\nthough I wish my inclusion in your annals could have been due to happier\ncircumstances. Let us discuss the future of Roshar together, here. I am eager\nto make your personal acquaintance.”\nThey waited as patiently as they could for a response. It finally came, in\nAlethi. “ ‘We of the Azish crown are saddened to share mourning for the\nfallen with you. As your noble brother was killed by the Shin destroyer, so\nwere beloved members of our court. This creates a bond between us.’ ”\nThat was all.\nNavani clicked her tongue. “They’re not going to be pushed into an\nanswer.”\n“They could at least explain themselves!” Dalinar snapped. “It feels like\nwe’re having two different conversations!”\n“The Azish,” Teshav said, “do not like to give offense. They’re almost as\nbad as the Emuli in that regard, particularly with foreigners.”\nIt wasn’t only an Azish attribute, in Dalinar’s estimation. It was the way\nof politicians worldwide. Already this conversation was starting to feel like\nhis efforts to bring the highprinces to his side, back in the warcamps. Half\nanswer after half answer, mild promises with no bite to them, laughing eyes\nthat mocked him even while they pretended to be perfectly sincere.\nStorms. Here he was again.

The Voidbringers have returned. I would\nhave you know that the Alethi are your allies in this conflict. We would\nshare information regarding our successes and failures in resisting this\nenemy, with hope that you will report the same to us.

We are glad to exchange\ninformation. What do you know of these transformed parshmen?’ ”\n“We engaged them on the Shattered Plains,” Dalinar said, relieved to\nmake some kind of headway. “Creatures with red eyes, and similar in many\nways to the parshmen we found on the Shattered Plains—only more\ndangerous. I will have my scribes prepare reports for you detailing all we\nhave learned in fighting the Parshendi over the years.”\n“ ‘Excellent,’ ” the reply finally came. “ ‘This information will be\nextremely welcome in our current conflict.’ ”\n“What is the status of your cities?” Dalinar asked. “What have the\nparshmen been doing there? Do they seem to have a goal beyond wanton\ndestruction?”\nTensely, they waited for word. So far they’d been able to discover\nblessed little about the parshmen the world over. Captain Kaladin sent\nreports using scribes from towns he visited, but knew next to nothing. Cities\nwere in chaos, and reliable information scarce.\n“ ‘Fortunately,’ ” came the reply, “ ‘our city stands, and the enemy is not\nactively attacking any longer. We are negotiating with the hostiles.’ ”\n“Negotiating?” Dalinar said, shocked. He turned to Teshav, who shook\nher head in wonder.\n“Please clarify, Your Majesty,” Navani said. “The Voidbringers are\nwilling to negotiate with you?”\n“ ‘Yes,’ ” came the reply. “ ‘We are exchanging contracts. They have\nvery detailed demands, with outrageous stipulations. We hope that we can\nforestall armed conflict in order to gather ourselves and fortify the city.’ ”\n“They can write?” Navani pressed. “The Voidbringers themselves are\nsending you contracts?”\n“ ‘The average parshman cannot write, so far as we can tell,’ ” the reply\ncame. “ ‘But some are different—stronger, with strange powers. They do\nnot speak like the others.’ ”\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said, stepping up to the spanreed writing table,\nspeaking more urgently—as if the emperor and his ministers could hear his\npassion through the written word. “I need to talk to you directly. I can come\nmyself, through the portal we wrote of earlier. We must get it working\nagain.”\nSilence.

It stretched so long that Dalinar found himself grinding his\nteeth, itching to summon a Shardblade and dismiss it, over and over, as had\nbeen his habit as a youth. He’d picked it up from his brother.\nA response finally came. “ ‘We regret to inform you that the device you\nmention,’ ” Kalami read, “ ‘is not functional in our city. We have\ninvestigated it, and have found that it was destroyed long ago. We cannot\ncome to you, nor you to us. Many apologies.’ ”\n“He’s telling us this now?” Dalinar said. “Storms! That’s information we\ncould have used as soon as he learned it!”\n“It’s a lie,” Navani said. “The Oathgate on the Shattered Plains\nfunctioned after centuries of storms and crem buildup. The one in Azimir is\na monument in the Grand Market, a large dome in the center of the city.”\nOr so she’d determined from maps. The one in Kholinar had been\nincorporated into the palace structure, while the one in Thaylen City was\nsome kind of religious monument. A beautiful relic like this wouldn’t\nsimply be destroyed.\n“I agree with Brightness Navani’s assessment,” Teshav said. “They are\nworried about the idea of you or your armies visiting. This is an excuse.”\nShe frowned, as if the emperor and his ministers were little more than\nspoiled children disobeying their tutors.\nThe spanreed started writing again.\n“What does it say?” Dalinar said, anxious.\n“It’s an affidavit,” Navani said, amused. “That the Oathgate is not\nfunctional, signed by imperial architects and stormwardens.” She read\nfurther. “Oh, this is delightful. Only the Azish would assume you’d want\ncertification that something is broken.”\n“Notably,” Kalami added, “it only certifies that the device ‘does not\nfunction as a portal.’ But of course it would not, not unless a Radiant were\nto visit and work it. This affidavit basically says that when turned off, the\ndevice doesn’t work.”\n“Write this, Kalami,” Dalinar said. “Your Majesty. You ignored me once.\nDestruction caused by the Everstorm was the result. Please, this time listen.\nYou cannot negotiate with the Voidbringers. We must unify, share\ninformation, and protect Roshar. Together.”\nShe wrote it and Dalinar waited, hands pressed against the table.\n“ ‘We misspoke when we mentioned negotiations,’ ” Kalami read. “ ‘It\nwas a mistake of translation. We agree to share information, but time is\nshort right now. We will contact you again to further discuss. Farewell,\nHighprince Kholin.’ ”\n“Bah!” Dalinar said, pushing himself back from the table. “Fools, idiots!\nStorming lighteyes and Damnation’s own politics!” He stalked across the\nroom, wishing he had something to kick, before forcing his temper under\ncontrol.\n“That’s more of a stonewall than I expected,” Navani said, folding her\narms. “Brightness Khal?”\n“In my experiences with the Azish,” Teshav said, “they are extremely\nproficient at saying very little in as many words as possible. This is not an\nunusual example of communication with their upper ministers. Don’t be put"

Don’t be put\noff; it will take time to accomplish anything with them.”\n“Time during which Roshar burns,” Dalinar said. “Why did they pull\nback regarding their claim to have had negotiations with the Voidbringers?\nAre they thinking of allying themselves to the enemy?”\n“I hesitate to guess,” Teshav said. “But I would say that they simply\ndecided they’d given away more information than intended.”\n“We need Azir,” Dalinar said. “Nobody in Makabak will listen to us\nunless we have Azir’s blessing, not to mention that Oathgate.…” He trailed\noff as a different spanreed on the table started blinking.\n“It’s the Thaylens,” Kalami said. “They’re early.”\n“You want to reschedule?” Navani asked.\nDalinar shook his head. “No, we can’t afford to wait another few days\nbefore the queen can spare time again.” He took a deep breath. Storms,\ntalking to politicians was more exhausting than a hundred-mile march in\nfull armor. “Proceed, Kalami. I’ll contain my frustration.”\nNavani settled down on one of the seats, though Dalinar remained\nstanding. Light poured in through the windows, pure and bright. It flowed\ndown, bathing him. He breathed in, almost feeling as if he could taste the\nsunlight. He’d spent too many days inside the twisting stone corridors of\nUrithiru, lit by the frail light of candles and lamps.\n“ ‘Her Royal Highness,’ ” Kalami read, “ ‘Brightness Fen Rnamdi,\nqueen of Thaylenah, writes to you.’ ” Kalami paused. “Brightlord … pardon\nthe interruption, but that indicates that the queen holds the spanreed herself\nrather than using a scribe.”\nTo another woman, that would have been intimidating. To Kalami, it was\nmerely one of many footnotes—which she added copiously to the bottom of\nthe page before preparing the reed to relay Dalinar’s words.\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said, clasping his hands behind his back and\npacing the stage at the center of the seats. Do better. Unite them. “I send you\ngreetings from Urithiru, holy city of the Knights Radiant, and extend to you\nour humblest invitation. This tower is truly a sight to behold, matched only\nby the glory of a sitting monarch. I would be honored to present it for you\nto experience.”\nThe spanreed quickly scribbled a reply. Queen Fen was writing directly\nin Alethi. “ ‘Kholin,’ ” Kalami read, “ ‘you old brute. Quit spreading chull\nscat. What do you really want?’ ”\n“I always did like her,” Navani noted.\n“I’m being sincere, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “My only desire is for\nus to meet in person, and to talk to you and show you what we’ve\ndiscovered. The world is changing around us.”\n“ ‘Oh,’ ” came the reply, “ ‘the world is changing, is it? What led you to\nthis incredible conclusion?

Was it the fact that our slaves suddenly became\nVoidbringers, or was it perhaps the storm that blew the wrong way,’—She\nwrote that twice as large as the line around it, Brightlord—‘ripping our\ncities apart?’ ”\nAladar cleared his throat. “Her Majesty seems to be having a bad day.”\n“She’s insulting us,” Navani said. “For Fen, that actually implies a good\nday.”\n“She’s always been perfectly civil the few times I’ve met her,” Dalinar\nsaid with a frown.\n“She was being queenly then,” Navani said. “You’ve got her talking to\nyou directly. Trust me, it’s a good sign.”\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said, “please tell me of your parshmen. The\ntransformation came upon them?”\n“ ‘Yes,’ ” she replied. “ ‘Storming monsters stole our best ships—almost\neverything in the harbor from single-masted sloops on up—and escaped the\ncity.’ ”\n“They … sailed?” Dalinar said, again shocked. “Confirm. They didn’t\nattack?”\n“ ‘There were some scuffles,’ ” Fen wrote, “ ‘but most everyone was too\nbusy dealing with the effects of the storm. By the time we got things\nsomewhat sorted out, they were sailing away in a grand fleet of royal\nwarships and private trading vessels alike.’ ”\nDalinar drew a breath. We don’t know half as much about the\nVoidbringers as we assumed. “Your Majesty,” he continued. “You might\nremember that we warned you about the imminent arrival of that storm.”\n“ ‘I believed you,’ ” Fen said. “ ‘If only because we got word from New\nNatanan confirming it. We tried to prepare, but a nation cannot upend four\nmillennia worth of tradition at a snap of the fingers. Thaylen City is a\nshambles, Kholin. The storm broke our aqueducts and sewer systems, and\nripped apart our docks—flattened the entire outer market! We have to fix all\nour cisterns, reinforce our buildings to withstand storms, and rebuild society\n—all without any parshman laborers and in the middle of the storming\nWeeping. I don’t have time for sightseeing.’ ”\n“It’s hardly sightseeing, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “I am aware of\nyour problems, and dire though they are, we cannot ignore the Voidbringers.\nI intend to convene a grand conference of kings to fight this threat.”\n“ ‘Led by you,’ ” Fen wrote in reply. “ ‘Of course.’ ”\n“Urithiru is the natural location for a meeting,” Dalinar said. “Your\nMajesty, the Knights Radiant have returned—we speak again their ancient\noaths, and bind the Surges of nature to us. If we can restore your Oathgate\nto functionality, you can be here in an afternoon, then return the same\nevening to direct the needs of your city.”\nNavani nodded at this tactic, though Aladar folded his arms, looking\nthoughtful.\n“What?” Dalinar asked him as Kalami wrote.\n“We need a Radiant to travel to the city to activate their Oathgate,\nright?” Aladar asked.\n“Yes,” Navani said. “A Radiant needs to unlock the gate on this side—"

        "text": "“We need a Radiant to travel to the city to activate their Oathgate,\nright?” Aladar asked.\n“Yes,” Navani said. “A Radiant needs to unlock the gate on this side—\nwhich we can do at any moment—then one has to travel to the destination\ncity and undo the lock there as well. That done, a Radiant can initiate a\ntransfer from either location.”\n“Then the only one we have that can theoretically get to Thaylen City is\nthe Windrunner,” Aladar said. “But what if it takes him months to get back\nhere? Or what if he’s captured by the enemy? Can we even make good on\nour promises, Dalinar?”\nA troubling problem, but one that Dalinar thought he might have an\nanswer to. There was a weapon that he’d decided to keep hidden for now. It\nmight work as well as a Radiant’s Shardblade in opening the Oathgates—\nand might let someone reach Thaylen City by flight.\nThat was moot for the time being. First he needed a willing ear on the\nother side of the spanreed.\nFen’s reply came. “ ‘I will admit that my merchants are intrigued by\nthese Oathgates. We have lore surrounding them here, that the one most\nPassionate could cause the portal of worlds to open again. I think every girl\nin Thaylenah dreams of being the one to invoke it.’ ”\n“The Passions,” Navani said with a downward turn of her lips. The\nThaylens had a pagan pseudo-religion, and that had always been a curious\naspect in dealing with them. They would praise the Heralds one moment,\nthen speak of the Passions the next.\nWell, Dalinar wasn’t one to fault another for unconventional beliefs.\n“ ‘If you want to send me what you know about these Oathgates, well,\nthat sounds great,’ ” Fen continued. “ ‘But I’m not interested in some grand\nconference of kings. You let me know what you boys come up with,\nbecause I’m going to be here frantically trying to rebuild my city.’ ”\n“Well,” Aladar said, “at least we finally got an honest response.”\n“I’m not convinced this is honest,” Dalinar said. He rubbed his chin,\nthinking. He’d only met this woman a few times, but something seemed off\nabout her responses.\n“I agree, Brightlord,” Teshav said. “I think any Thaylen would jump at\nthe chance to come pull strings at a meeting of monarchs, if only to see if\nshe can find a way to get trade deals out of them. She is most certainly\nhiding something.”\n“Offer troops,” Navani said, “to help her rebuild.”\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said, “I am deeply grieved to hear of your\nlosses. I have many soldiers here who are currently unoccupied. I would\ngladly send you a battalion to help repair your city.”\nThe reply was slow in coming. “ ‘I’m not sure what I think of having\nAlethi troops on my stone, well intentioned or not.’ ”\nAladar grunted. “She’s worried about invasion? Everyone knows Alethi\nand ships don’t mix.”\n“She’s not worried about us arriving on ships,” Dalinar said. “She’s\nworried about an army of troops suddenly materializing in the center of her\ncity.”"

        "text": "and ships don’t mix.”\n“She’s not worried about us arriving on ships,” Dalinar said. “She’s\nworried about an army of troops suddenly materializing in the center of her\ncity.”\nA very rational worry. If Dalinar had the inclination, he could send a\nWindrunner to secretly open a city’s Oathgate, and invade in an\nunprecedented assault that appeared right behind enemy lines.\nHe needed allies, not subjects, so he wouldn’t do it—at least not to a\npotentially friendly city. Kholinar, however, was another story. They still\ndidn’t have reliable word of what was happening in the Alethi capital. But if\nthe rioting was still going on, he’d been thinking that there might be a way\nto get armies in and restore order.\nFor now, he needed to focus on Queen Fen. “Your Majesty,” he said,\nnodding for Kalami to write, “consider my offer of troops, please. And as\nyou do, might I suggest that you begin searching among your people for\nbudding Knights Radiant? They are the key to working Oathgates.\n“We have had a number of Radiants manifest near the Shattered Plains.\nThey are formed through an interaction with certain spren, who seem to be\nsearching for worthy candidates. I can only assume this is happening\nworldwide. It is entirely likely that among the people of your city, someone\nhas already spoken the oaths.”\n“You’re giving up quite an advantage, Dalinar,” Aladar noted.\n“I’m planting a seed, Aladar,” Dalinar said. “And I’ll plant it on any hill\nI can find, regardless of who owns it. We must fight as a unified people.”\n“I don’t dispute that,” Aladar said, standing up and stretching. “But your\nknowledge of the Radiants is a bargaining point, one that can perhaps draw\npeople to you—force them to work with you. Give up too much, and you\nmight find a ‘headquarters’ for the Knights Radiant in every major city\nacross Roshar. Rather than working together, you’ll have them competing to\nrecruit.”\nHe was right, unfortunately. Dalinar hated turning knowledge into\nbargaining chips, but what if this was why he’d always failed in his\nnegotiations with the highprinces? He wanted to be honest, straightforward,\nand let the pieces fall where they may. But it seemed that someone better at\nthe game—and more willing to break the rules—always snatched the pieces\nfrom the air as he dropped them, then set them down the way they wanted.\n“And,” he said quickly for Kalami to add, “we would be happy to send\nour Radiants to train those you discover, then introduce them to the system\nand fraternity of Urithiru, to which each of them has a right by nature of\ntheir oaths.”\nKalami added this, then twisted the spanreed to indicate they were done\nand waiting for a reply.\n“ ‘We will consider this,’ ” Kalami read as the spanreed scribbled across\nthe page. “ ‘The crown of Thaylenah thanks you for your interest in our\npeople, and we will consider negotiations regarding your offer of troops.\nWe have sent some of our few remaining cutters to track down the fleeing\nparshmen, and will inform you of what we discover. Until we speak again,\nHighprince.’ ”"

Until we speak again,\nHighprince.’ ”\n“Storms,” Navani said. “She reverted to queenspeak. We lost her\nsomewhere in there.”\nDalinar sat down in the seat next to her and let out a long sigh.\n“Dalinar…” she said.\n“I’m fine, Navani,” he said. “I can’t expect glowing commitments to\ncooperation on my first attempt. We’ll just have to keep trying.”\nThe words were more optimistic than he felt. He wished he could talk to\nthese people in person, instead of over spanreed.\nThey talked to the princess of Yezier next, followed by the prince of\nTashikk. They didn’t have Oathgates, and were less essential to his plan, but\nhe wanted to at least open lines of communication with them.\nNeither gave him more than vague answers. Without the Azish emperor’s\nblessing, he wouldn’t be able to get any of the smaller Makabaki kingdoms\nto commit. Perhaps the Emuli or the Tukari would listen, but he’d only ever\nget one of those two, considering their long-standing feud.\nAt the end of the last conference, Aladar and his daughter excusing\nthemselves, Dalinar stretched, feeling worn down. And this wasn’t the end\nof it. He would have discussions with the monarchs of Iri—it had three,\nstrangely. The Oathgate at Rall Elorim was in their lands, making them\nimportant—and they held sway over nearby Rira, which had another\nOathgate.\nBeyond that, of course, there were the Shin to deal with. They hated\nusing spanreeds, so Navani had poked at them through a Thaylen merchant\nwho had been willing to relay information.\nDalinar’s shoulder protested as he stretched. He had found middle age to\nbe like an assassin—quiet, creeping along behind him. Much of the time he\nwould go about his life as he always had, until an unexpected ache or pain\ngave warning. He was not the youth he had once been.\nAnd bless the Almighty for that, he thought idly, bidding farewell to\nNavani—who wanted to sift through information reports from various\nspanreed stations around the world. Aladar’s daughter and scribes were\ngathering them in bulk for her.\nDalinar collected several of his guards, leaving others for Navani should\nshe need some extra hands, and climbed up along the rows of seats to the\nroom’s exit at the top. Hovering just outside the doorway—like an\naxehound banished from the warmth of the fire—stood Elhokar.\n“Your Majesty?” Dalinar said, starting. “I’m glad you could make the\nmeeting. Are you feeling better?”\n“Why do they refuse you, Uncle?” Elhokar asked, ignoring the question.\n“Do they think perhaps you will try to usurp their thrones?”\nDalinar drew in his breath sharply, and his guards looked embarrassed to\nbe standing nearby. They backed up to give him and the king privacy.\n“Elhokar…” Dalinar said.\n“You likely think I say this in spite,” the king said, poking his head into\nthe room, noting his mother, then looking back at Dalinar. “I don’t.

For once in your life, just be honest\nwith me.”\n“You think I haven’t been?”\nElhokar raised his hand and lightly touched his own chest. “Perhaps you\nhave been, at times.

Ancient cities full\nof wonder? The Desolations?” Elhokar shook his head. “Perhaps …\nperhaps I’m a fine king. Not extraordinary, but not an abject failure. But in\nthe face of these events, the world needs better than fine.”\nThere seemed a fatalism to his words, and that sent a worried shiver\nthrough Dalinar. “Elhokar, what are you saying?”\nElhokar strode into the chamber and called down to those at the bottom\nof the rows of seats. “Mother, Brightness Teshav, would you witness\nsomething for me?”\nStorms, no, Dalinar thought, hurrying after Elhokar. “Don’t do this, son.”\n“We all must accept the consequences of our actions, Uncle,” Elhokar\nsaid. “I’ve been learning this very slowly, as I can be as dense as a stone.”\n“But—”\n“Uncle, am I your king?” Elhokar demanded.\n“Yes.”\n“Well, I shouldn’t be.” He knelt, shocking Navani and causing her to pull\nto a stop three-quarters of the way up the steps. “Dalinar Kholin,” Elhokar\nsaid in a loud voice, “I swear to you now. There are princes and\nhighprinces. Why not kings and highkings? I give an oath, immutable and\nwitnessed, that I accept you as my monarch. As Alethkar is to me, I am to\nyou.”\nDalinar breathed out, looking to Navani’s aghast face, then down to his\nnephew, kneeling as a vassal on the floor.\n“You did ask for this, Uncle,” Elhokar said. “Not specifically in words,\nbut it is the only place we could have gone. You have slowly been taking\ncommand ever since you decided to trust those visions.”\n“I’ve tried to include you,” Dalinar said. Silly, impotent words. He\nshould be better than that. “You are right, Elhokar. I’m sorry.”\n“Are you?” Elhokar asked. “Are you really?”\n“I’m sorry,” Dalinar said, “for your pain. I’m sorry that I didn’t handle\nthis better. I’m sorry that this … this must be. Before you make this oath,\ntell me what you expect that it entails?”\n“I’ve already said the words,” Elhokar said, growing red faced. “Before\nwitnesses. It is done. I’ve—”"

But let’s not pretend you can sweep into a room, shout a few words,\nand assume it’s a legal contract.”\nElhokar pulled his arm free and rubbed it. “Won’t even let me abdicate\nwith dignity.”\n“You’re not abdicating,” Navani said, joining them. She shot a glare at\nthe guards, who stood watching with slack jaws, and they grew white at the\nglare. She pointed at them as if to say, Not a word of this to anyone else.\n“Elhokar, you intend to shove your uncle into a position above you. He’s\nright to ask. What will this mean for Alethkar?”\n“I…” Elhokar swallowed. “He should give up his lands to his heir.\nDalinar is a king of somewhere else, after all. Dalinar, Highking of Urithiru,\nmaybe the Shattered Plains.” He stood straighter, speaking more certainly.\n“Dalinar must stay out of the direct management of my lands. He can give\nme commands, but I decide how to see them accomplished.”\n“It sounds reasonable,” Navani said, glancing at Dalinar.\nReasonable, but gut-wrenching. The kingdom he’d fought for—the\nkingdom he’d forged in pain, exhaustion, and blood—now rejected him.\nThis is my land now, Dalinar thought. This tower covered in coldspren. “I\ncan accept these terms, though at times I might need to give commands to\nyour highprinces.”\n“As long as they’re in your domain,” Elhokar said, a hint of\nstubbornness to his voice, “I consider them under your authority. While they\nvisit Urithiru or the Shattered Plains, command as you wish. When they\nreturn to my kingdom, you must go through me.” He looked to Dalinar, and\nthen glanced down, as if embarrassed to be making demands.\n“Very well,” Dalinar said. “Though we need to work this out with scribes\nbefore we make the change officially. And before we go too far, we should\nmake certain there is still an Alethkar for you to rule.”\n“I’ve been thinking the same thing. Uncle, I want to lead our forces to\nAlethkar and recapture our homeland. Something is wrong in Kholinar.\nMore than these riots or my wife’s supposed behavior, more than the\nspanreeds going still. The enemy is doing something in the city. I’ll take an\narmy to stop it, and save the kingdom.”\nElhokar? Leading troops? Dalinar had been imagining himself leading a\nforce, cutting through the Voidbringer ranks, sweeping them from Alethkar\nand marching into Kholinar to restore order.\nTruth was, though, it didn’t make sense for either of them to lead such an\nassault. “Elhokar,” Dalinar said, leaning in. “I’ve been considering\nsomething.

Once it works, we can transport our forces into the city to secure the\npalace, restore order, and fend off the Voidbringers.”\n“Get into the city,” Elhokar said. “Uncle, to do that we might need an\narmy in the first place!”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “A small team could reach Kholinar far faster than\nan army. As long as there was a Radiant with them, they could sneak in,\nrestore the Oathgate, and open the way for the rest of us.”\nElhokar perked up. “Yes! I’ll do it, Uncle. I’ll take a team and reclaim\nour home. Aesudan is there; if the rioting is still happening, she’s fighting\nagainst it.”\nThat wasn’t what the reports—before they’d cut off—had suggested to\nDalinar. If anything, the queen was the cause of the riots. And he certainly\nhadn’t been intending Elhokar to go on this mission himself.\nConsequences. The lad was earnest, as he’d always been. Besides,\nElhokar seemed to have learned something from his near death at the hands\nof assassins. He was certainly humbler now than he’d been in years past.\n“It is fitting,” Dalinar said, “that their king should be the one who saves\nthem. I will see that you have whatever resources you need, Elhokar.”\nGlowing gloryspren orbs burst around Elhokar. He grinned at them. “I\nonly seem to see those when I’m around you, Uncle. Funny. For all that I\nshould resent you, I don’t. It’s hard to resent a man who is doing his best.\nI’ll do it. I’ll save Alethkar. I need one of your Radiants. The hero,\npreferably.”\n“The hero?”\n“The bridgeman,” Elhokar said. “The soldier. He needs to go with me, so\nif I screw up and fail, someone will be there to save the city anyway.”\nDalinar blinked. “That’s very … um…”\n“I’ve had ample chances to reflect lately, Uncle,” Elhokar said. “The\nAlmighty has preserved me, despite my stupidity. I’ll bring the bridgeman\nwith me, and I’ll observe him. Figure out why he’s so special. See if he’ll\nteach me to be like him. And if I fail…” He shrugged. “Well, Alethkar is in\nsafe hands regardless, right?”\nDalinar nodded, bemused.\n“I need to make plans,” Elhokar said. “I’ve only just recovered from my\nwounds. But I can’t leave until the hero returns anyway. Could he fly me\nand my chosen team to the city? That would certainly be the fastest way. I\nwill want every report we’ve had from Kholinar, and I need to study the\nOathgate device in person. Yes, and have drawings done comparing it to the\none in the city.

Navani hovered by\nhis side as he settled down in one of the seats for the Radiants, beside a\npedestal for a little spren.\nOn one side, he had a king swearing to him an oath he didn’t want. On\nthe other, he had an entire group of monarchs who wouldn’t listen to his\nmost rational of suggestions. Storms.\n“Dalinar?” Kalami said. “Dalinar!”\nHe leaped to his feet, and Navani spun. Kalami was watching one of the\nspanreeds, which had started writing. What was it now? What terrible news\nawaited him?\n“ ‘Your Majesty,’ ” Kalami read from the page, “ ‘I consider your offer\ngenerous, and your advice wise. We have located the device you call an\nOathgate. One of my people has come forward, and—remarkably—claims\nto be Radiant. Her spren directed her to speak with me; we plan to use her\nShardblade to test the device.\n“ ‘If it works, I will come to you in all haste. It is well that someone is\nattempting to organize a resistance to the evils that befall us. The nations of\nRoshar must put aside their squabbles, and the reemergence of the holy city\nof Urithiru is proof to me that the Almighty guides your hand. I look\nforward to counseling with you and adding my forces to yours in a joint\noperation to protect these lands.’ ” She looked up at him, amazed. “It was\nsent by Taravangian, king of Jah Keved and Kharbranth.”\nTaravangian? Dalinar hadn’t expected him to reply so quickly. He was\nsaid to be a kindly, if somewhat simple man. Perfect for ruling a small city-\nstate with the help of a governing council. His elevation to king of Jah\nKeved was widely seen as an act of spite from the former king, who hadn’t\nwanted to give the throne to any of his rivals’ houses.\nThe words still warmed Dalinar. Someone had listened. Someone was\nwilling to join him. Bless that man, bless him.\nIf Dalinar failed everywhere else, at least he would have King\nTaravangian at his side.\n13.

She had become\nVeil, a disguise she’d been working on for some time.\nShallan held up hands that were callused and worked—even the\nsafehand. Not that Veil was unfeminine. She kept her nails filed, and liked\nto dress nicely, keep her hair brushed. She simply didn’t have time for\nfrivolities. A good sturdy coat and trousers suited Veil better than a flowing\nhavah. And she had no time for an extended sleeve covering her safehand.\nShe’d wear a glove, thank you very much.\nAt the moment she was dressed in her nightgown; she’d change later,\nonce she was ready to sneak out into Urithiru’s halls. She needed some\npractice first. Though she felt bad about the use of Stormlight when\neveryone else was scrimping, Dalinar had told her to train with her powers.\nShe strode through her chamber, adopting Veil’s gait—confident and\nsturdy, never prim. You couldn’t balance a book on Veil’s head as she\nwalked, but she’d happily balance one on your face after she knocked you\nunconscious.\nShe circled the room several times, crossing the patch of evening light\nfrom the window. Her room was ornamented by bright circular patterns of\nstrata on the walls. The stone was smooth to the touch, and a knife couldn’t\nscratch it.\nThere wasn’t much furniture, though Shallan was hopeful that the latest\nscavenging expeditions to the warcamps would return with something she\ncould appropriate from Sebarial. For now she did what she could with some\nblankets, a single stool, and—blessedly—a hand mirror. She’d hung it on\nthe wall, tied to a stone knob that she assumed was for hanging pictures.\nShe checked her face in the mirror. She wanted to get to the point where\nshe could become Veil at a moment’s notice, without needing to review\nsketches. She prodded at her features, but of course as the more angular\nnose and pronounced forehead were a result of Lightweaving, she couldn’t\nfeel them.\nWhen she frowned, Veil’s face mimicked the motion perfectly.\n“Something to drink, please,” she said. No, rougher. “Drink. Now.” Too\nstrong?\n“Mmm,” Pattern said. “The voice becomes a good lie.”\n“Thank you. I’ve been working on sounds.” Veil’s voice was deeper than\nShallan’s, rougher. She’d started to wonder, how far could she go in\nchanging how things sounded?\nFor now, she wasn’t sure she’d gotten the lips right in the illusion. She\nsauntered over to her art supplies and flipped open her sketchbook, looking\nfor renditions of Veil she’d drawn instead of going to dinner with Sebarial\nand Palona.\nThe first page of the sketchbook was of the corridor with the twisting\nstrata she’d passed through the other day: lines of madness curling toward\ndarkness. She flipped to the next, a picture of one of the tower’s budding\nmarkets. Thousands of merchants, washwomen, prostitutes, innkeepers, and\ncraftsmen of all varieties were setting up in Urithiru. Shallan knew well\nhow many—she’d been the one to bring them all through the Oathgate."

Shallan knew well\nhow many—she’d been the one to bring them all through the Oathgate.\nIn her sketch, the black upper reaches of the large market cavern loomed\nover tiny figures scurrying between tents, holding fragile lights. The next\nwas another tunnel into darkness. And the next. Then a room where the\nstrata coiled about one another in a mesmerizing manner. She hadn’t\nrealized she’d done so many. She flipped twenty pages before she found her\nsketches of Veil.\nYes, the lips were right. The build was wrong, however. Veil had a lean\nstrength, and that wasn’t coming through in the nightgown. It looked too\nmuch like Shallan’s figure beneath.\nSomeone knocked on the wooden plate hung outside her rooms. She had\njust a cloth draping the doorway right now. Many of the tower’s doors had\nwarped over the years; hers had been ripped out, and she was still waiting\non a replacement.\nThe one knocking would be Palona, who had once again noticed that\nShallan had skipped dinner. Shallan sucked in a breath, destroying the\nimage of Veil, recovering some of the Stormlight from her Lightweaving.\n“Come,” she said. Honestly, it didn’t seem to matter to Palona that Shallan\nwas a storming Knight Radiant now, she’d still mother her all the—\nAdolin stepped in, carrying a large plate of food in one hand, some\nbooks under the other arm. He saw her and stumbled, nearly dropping it all.\nShallan froze, then yelped and tucked her bare safehand behind her back.\nAdolin didn’t even have the decency to blush at finding her practically\nnaked. He balanced the food in his hand, recovering from his stumble, and\nthen grinned.\n“Out!” Shallan said, waving her freehand at him. “Out, out, out!”\nHe backed away awkwardly, through the draped cloth over the doorway.\nStormfather! Shallan’s blush was probably so bright they could have used\nher as a signal to send the army to war. She pulled on a glove, then wrapped\nthat in a safepouch, then threw on the blue dress she had draped over the\nback of her chair and did up the sleeve. She didn’t have the presence of\nmind to pull on her bodice vest first, not that she really needed one anyway.\nShe kicked it under a blanket instead.\n“In my defense,” Adolin said from outside, “you did invite me in.”\n“I thought you were Palona!” Shallan said, doing up the buttons on the\nside of her dress—which proved difficult, with three layers covering her\nsafehand.\n“You know, you could check to see who is at your door.”\n“Don’t make this my fault,” Shallan said. “You’re the one slipping into\nyoung ladies’ bedrooms practically unannounced.”\n“I knocked!”\n“The knock was feminine.”\n“It was … Shallan!”\n“Did you knock with one hand or two?”\n“I’m carrying a storming platter of food—for you, by the way. Of course\nthe knock was one-handed. And seriously, who knocks with two?”\n“It was quite feminine, then. I’d have thought that imitating a woman to\ncatch a glimpse of a young lady in her undergarments was beneath you,"

And just so\nwe’re clear, I’m a man and your betrothed, my name is Adolin Kholin, I\nwas born under the sign of the nine, I have a birthmark on the back of my\nleft thigh, and I had crab curry for breakfast. Anything else you need to\nknow?”\nShe poked her head out, pulling the cloth tight around her neck. “Back of\nyour left thigh, eh? What’s a girl got to do to sneak a glimpse of that?”\n“Knock like a man, apparently.”\nShe gave him a grin. “Just a sec. This dress is being a pain.” She ducked\nback into the room.\n“Yes, yes. Take your time. I’m not standing out here holding a heavy\nplatter of food, smelling it after having skipped dinner so I could dine with\nyou.”\n“It’s good for you,” Shallan said. “Builds strength, or something. Isn’t\nthat the sort of thing you do? Strangle rocks, stand on your head, throw\nboulders around.”\n“Yes, I have quite my share of murdered rocks stuffed under my bed.”\nShallan grabbed her dress with her teeth at the neck to pull it tight,\nhelping with the buttons. Maybe.\n“What is it with women and their undergarments anyway?” Adolin said,\nthe platter clinking as some of the plates slid against one another. “I mean,\nthat shift covers basically the same parts as a formal dress.”\n“It’s the decency of it,” Shallan said around a mouthful of fabric.\n“Besides, certain things have a tendency to poke out through a shift.”\n“Still seems arbitrary to me.”\n“Oh, and men aren’t arbitrary about clothing? A uniform is basically the\nsame as any other coat, right? Besides, aren’t you the one who spends his\nafternoons searching through fashion folios?”\nHe chuckled and started a reply, but Shallan, finally dressed, swept back\nthe sheet on her doorway. Adolin stood up from leaning against the wall of\nthe corridor and took her in—frazzled hair, dress that she had missed two\nbuttons on, cheeks flushed. Then he grinned a dopey grin.\nAsh’s eyes … he actually thought she was pretty. This wonderful,\nprincely man actually liked being with her. She’d traveled to the ancient city\nof the Knights Radiant, but compared to Adolin’s affection, all the sights of\nUrithiru were dun spheres.\nHe liked her. And he brought her food.\nDo not find a way to screw this up, Shallan thought to herself as she took\nthe books from under his arm. She stepped aside, letting him enter and set\nthe platter on the floor. “Palona said you hadn’t eaten,” he said, “and then\nshe found out I’d skipped dinner. So, uh…”\n“So she sent you with a lot,” Shallan said, inspecting the platter piled\nhigh with dishes, flatbreads, and shellfood."

She’d been intending to get\nsomething at one of the taverns later tonight while prowling about wearing\nVeil’s face. Those taverns had set up in the main market, despite Navani’s\nattempts to send them elsewhere, and Sebarial’s merchants had quite the\nstock to sell.\nNow that this was all before her … well, she didn’t worry much about\ndecorum as she settled down on the ground and started to spoon herself up a\nthin, watery curry with vegetables.\nAdolin remained standing. He did look sharp in that blue uniform,\nthough admittedly she’d never really seen him in anything else. Birthmark\non the thigh, eh …\n“You’ll have to sit on the ground,” Shallan said. “No chairs yet.”\n“I just realized,” he said, “this is your bedroom.”\n“And my drawing room, and my sitting room, and my dining room, and\nmy ‘Adolin says obvious things’ room. It’s quite versatile, this room—\nsingular—of mine. Why?”\n“I’m just wondering if it’s proper,” he said, then actually blushed—\nwhich was adorable. “For us to be in here alone.”\n“Now you’re worried about propriety?”\n“Well, I did recently get lectured about it.”\n“That wasn’t a lecture,” Shallan said, taking a bite of food. The succulent\ntastes overwhelmed her mouth, bringing on that delightful sharp pain and\nmixing of flavor that you only got from the first bite of something sweet.\nShe closed her eyes and smiled, savoring it.\n“So … not a lecture?” Adolin said. “Was there to be more to that quip?”\n“Sorry,” she said, opening her eyes. “It wasn’t a lecture, it was a creative\napplication of my tongue to keep you distracted.” Looking at his lips, she\ncould think of some other creative applications for her tongue.…\nRight. She took a deep breath.\n“It would be inappropriate,” Shallan said, “if we were alone. Fortunately,\nwe are not.”\n“Your ego doesn’t count as a separate individual, Shallan.”\n“Ha! Wait. You think I have an ego?”\n“It just sounded good—I don’t mean … Not that … Why are you\ngrinning?”\n“Sorry,” Shallan said, making two fists before herself and shivering in\nglee. She’d spent so long feeling timid, it was so satisfying to hear a\nreference to her confidence. It was working! Jasnah’s teaching about\npracticing and acting like she was in control. It was working.\nWell, except for that whole part about having to admit to herself that\nshe’d killed her mother. As soon as she thought of it, she instinctively tried\nto shove the memory away, but it wouldn’t budge. She’d spoken it to\nPattern as a truth—which were the odd Ideals of the Lightweavers.\nIt was stuck in her mind, and every time she thought about it, the gaping\nwound flared up with pain again.

Her father\nhad covered it up, pretended he’d murdered his wife, and the event had\ndestroyed his life—driving him to anger and destruction.\nUntil eventually Shallan had killed him too.\n“Shallan?” Adolin asked. “Are you well?”\nNo.\n“Sure. Fine. Anyway, we aren’t alone. Pattern, come here please.” She\nheld out her hand, palm up.\nHe reluctantly moved down from the wall where he’d been watching. As\nalways, he made a ripple in whatever he crossed, be it cloth or stone—like\nthere was something under the surface. His complex, fluctuating pattern of\nlines was always changing, melding, vaguely circular but with surprising\ntangents.\nHe crossed up her dress and onto her hand, then split out from beneath\nher skin and rose into the air, expanding fully into three dimensions. He\nhovered there, a black, eye-bending network of shifting lines—some\npatterns shrinking while others expanded, rippling across his surface like a\nfield of moving grass.\nShe would not hate him. She could hate the sword she’d used to kill her\nmother, but not him. She managed to push aside the pain for now—not\nforgetting it, but hopefully not letting it spoil her time with Adolin.\n“Prince Adolin,” Shallan said, “I believe you’ve heard my spren’s voice\nbefore. Let me introduce you formally. This is Pattern.”\nAdolin knelt, reverent, and stared at the mesmerizing geometries.\nShallan didn’t blame him; she’d lost herself more than once in that network\nof lines and shapes that almost seemed to repeat, but never quite did.\n“Your spren,” Adolin said. “A Shallanspren.”\nPattern sniffed in annoyance at that.\n“He’s called a Cryptic,” she said. “Every order of Radiant bonds a\ndifferent variety of spren, and that bond lets me do what I do.”\n“Craft illusions,” Adolin said softly. “Like that one with the map the\nother day.”\nShallan smiled and—realizing she had just a smidge of Stormlight left\nfrom her illusion earlier—was unable to resist showing off. She raised her\nsleeved safehand and breathed out, sending a shimmering patch of\nStormlight above the blue cloth. It formed into a small image of Adolin\nfrom her sketches of him in his Shardplate. This one remained frozen,\nShardblade on his shoulder, faceplate up—like a little doll.\n“This is an incredible talent, Shallan,” Adolin said, poking at the version\nof himself—which fuzzed, offering no resistance. He paused, then poked at\nPattern, who shied back. “Why do you insist on hiding this, pretending that\nyou’re a different order than you are?”\n“Well,” she said, thinking fast and closing her hand, dismissing the\nimage of Adolin. “I just think it might give us an edge. Sometimes secrets\nare important.”\nAdolin nodded slowly. “Yeah. Yeah, they are.”\n“Anyway,” Shallan said. “Pattern, you’re to be our chaperone tonight.”\n“What,” Pattern said with a hum, “is a chaperone?”"

It will be all right.”\nPattern hummed, melting down into his two-dimensional form and\ntaking up residence on the side of a bowl. He seemed content there, like a\ncremling snuggled into its crack.\nUnable to wait any longer, Shallan dug into her meal. Adolin settled\ndown across from her and attacked his own food. For a time, Shallan\nignored her pain and savored the moment—good food, good company, the\nsetting sun casting ruby and topaz light across the mountains and into the\nroom. She felt like drawing this scene, but knew it was the type of moment\nshe couldn’t capture on a page. It wasn’t about content or composition, but\nthe pleasure of living.\nThe trick to happiness wasn’t in freezing every momentary pleasure and\nclinging to each one, but in ensuring one’s life would produce many future\nmoments to anticipate.\nAdolin—after finishing an entire plate of stranna haspers steamed in the\nshell—picked out a few chunks of pork from a creamy red curry, then put\nthem on a plate and handed them in her direction. “Wanna try a bite?”\nShallan made a gagging noise.\n“Come on,” he said, wagging the plate. “It’s delicious.”\n“It would burn my lips off, Adolin Kholin,” Shallan said. “Don’t think I\ndidn’t notice you picking the absolute spiciest concoction Palona sent.\nMen’s food is dreadful. How can you taste anything beneath all that spice?”\n“Keeps it from being bland,” Adolin said, stabbing one of the chunks and\npopping it in his mouth. “There’s nobody here but us. You can try it.”\nShe eyed it, remembering the times as a child when she’d sneaked tastes\nof men’s food—though not this specific dish.\nPattern buzzed. “Is this the inappropriate thing I’m supposed to stop you\nfrom doing?”\n“No,” Shallan said, and Pattern settled back down. Perhaps a chaperone,\nshe thought, who believes basically everything I tell him isn’t going to be\nthe most effective.\nStill, with a sigh, she grabbed a chunk of the pork in some flatbread. She\nhad left Jah Keved hunting new experiences, after all.\nShe tried a bite, and was given immediate reason to regret her decisions\nin life.\nEyes brimming with tears, she scrambled for the cup of water Adolin,\ninsufferably, had picked up to hand toward her. She gulped that down,\nthough it didn’t seem to do anything. She followed it by wiping her tongue\nwith a napkin—in the most feminine way possible, of course.\n“I hate you,” she said, drinking his water next.\nAdolin chuckled.\n“Oh!” Pattern said suddenly, bursting up from the bowl to hover in the\nair. “You were talking about mating!

Dictates of custom\nrequire following certain patterns before you copulate. I’ve been studying\nthis!”\n“Oh, Stormfather,” Shallan said, covering her eyes with her freehand. A\nfew shamespren even peeked in for a glimpse before vanishing. Twice in\none week.\n“Very well, you two,” Pattern said. “No mating. NO MATING.” He\nhummed to himself, as if pleased, then sank down onto a plate.\n“Well, that was humiliating,” Shallan said. “Can we maybe talk about\nthose books you brought? Or ancient Vorin theology, or strategies for\ncounting grains of sand? Anything other than what just happened? Please?”\nAdolin chuckled, then reached for a slim notebook that was on top of the\npile. “May Aladar sent teams to question Vedekar Perel’s family and\nfriends. They discovered where he was before he died, who last saw him,\nand wrote down anything suspicious. I thought we could read the report.”\n“And the rest of the books?”\n“You seemed lost when Father asked you about Makabaki politics,”\nAdolin said, pouring some wine, merely a soft yellow. “So I asked around,\nand it seems that some of the ardents hauled their entire libraries out here. I\nwas able to get a servant to locate you a few books I’d enjoyed on the\nMakabaki.”\n“Books?” Shallan said. “You?”\n“I don’t spend all my time hitting people with swords, Shallan,” Adolin\nsaid. “Jasnah and Aunt Navani made very certain that my youth was filled\nwith interminable periods spent listening to ardents lecture me on politics\nand trade. Some of it stuck in my brain, against my natural inclinations.\nThose three books are the best of the ones I remember having read to me,\nthough the last one is an updated version. I thought it might help.”\n“That’s thoughtful,” she said. “Really, Adolin.

I have to hear this story.”\n“Fortunately, I just told it to you. His name was Kabsal, and he was so\nincredibly sweet to me that I can almost forgive him for trying to kill me.”\nAdolin grinned. “Well, it’s nice to hear that I don’t have a high bar to\njump—all I have to do is not poison you. Though you shouldn’t be telling\nme about past lovers. You’ll make me jealous.”\n“Please,” Shallan said, dipping her bread in some leftover sweet curry.\nHer tongue still hadn’t recovered. “You’ve courted, like, half the\nwarcamps.”\n“It’s not that bad.”\n“Isn’t it? From what I hear, I’d have to go to Herdaz to find an eligible\nwoman you haven’t pursued.” She held out her hand to him, to help her to\nher feet.\n“Are you mocking my failings?”\n“No, I’m lauding them,” she said, standing up beside him. “You see,\nAdolin dear, if you hadn’t wrecked all those other relationships, you\nwouldn’t be here. With me.” She pulled close. “And so, in reality, you’re\nthe greatest at relationships there ever was. You ruined only the wrong ones,\nyou see.”\nHe leaned down. His breath smelled of spices, his uniform of the crisp,\nclean starch Dalinar required. His lips touched hers, and her heart fluttered.\nSo warm.\n“No mating!”\nShe started, pulling out of the kiss to find Pattern hovering beside them,\npulsing quickly through shapes.\nAdolin bellowed a laugh, and Shallan couldn’t help joining in at the\nridiculousness of it. She stepped back from him, but kept hold on his hand.\n“Neither of us is going to mess this up,” she said to him, squeezing his\nhand. “Despite what might at times seem like our best efforts otherwise.”\n“Promise?” he asked.\n“I promise.

The dim light served him well,\nas he was able to settle between some bushes right at the edge of the\nVoidbringer camp. Between trees they had stretched tarps, which leaked\nhorribly. In one place they’d made a proper tent, fully enclosed with walls\n—and he couldn’t see what was inside.\nThere wasn’t enough shelter, so many sat out in the rain. Kaladin spent a\ntorturous few minutes expecting to be spotted. All they had to do was notice\nthat these bushes had drawn in their leaves at his touch.\nNobody looked, fortunately.

One of them had a set of wooden Herdazian cards, and he sat\nat the edge of the camp—directly before Kaladin—using a flat surface of\nstone as a table. A female sat opposite him.\nThey looked different from what he expected. For one thing, their skin\nwas a different shade—many parshmen here in Alethkar had marbled white\nand red skin, rather than the deep red on black like Rlain from Bridge Four.\nThey didn’t wear warform, though neither did they wear some terrible,\npowerful form. Though they were squat and bulky, their only carapace ran\nalong the sides of their forearms and jutted out at their temples, leaving\nthem with full heads of hair.\nThey still wore their simple slave smocks, tied at the waists with strings.\nNo red eyes. Did that change, perhaps, like his own eyes?\nThe male—distinguished by a dark red beard, the hairs each unnaturally\nthick—finally placed a card on the rock next to several others.\n“Can you do that?” the female asked.\n“I think so.”\n“You said squires can’t capture.”\n“Unless another card of mine is touching yours,” the male said. He\nscratched at his beard. “I think?”\nKaladin felt cold, like the rainwater was seeping in through his skin,\npenetrating all the way to his blood and washing through him. They spoke\nlike Alethi. Not a hint of an accent. With his eyes closed, he wouldn’t have\nbeen able to tell these voices from those of common darkeyed villagers\nfrom Hearthstone, save for the fact that the female had a deeper voice than\nmost human women.\n“So…” the female said. “You’re saying you don’t know how to play the\ngame after all.”\nThe male began gathering up the cards. “I should know, Khen. How\nmany times did I watch them play? Standing there with my tray of drinks. I\nshould be an expert at this, shouldn’t I?”\n“Apparently not.”\nThe female stood and walked over to another group, who were trying to\nbuild a fire under a tarp without much success. It took a special kind of luck"

It took a special kind of luck\nto be able to get flames going outside during the Weeping. Kaladin, like\nmost in the military, had learned to live with the constant dampness.\nThey had the stolen sacks of grain—Kaladin could see them piled\nunderneath one of the tarps. The grain had swollen, splitting several of the\nsacks. Several were eating soggy handfuls, since they had no bowls.\nKaladin wished he didn’t immediately taste the mushy, awful stuff in his\nown mouth. He’d been given unspiced, boiled tallew on many occasions.\nOften he’d considered it a blessing.\nThe male who’d been speaking continued to sit on his rock, holding up a\nwooden card. They were a lacquered set, durable. Kaladin had occasionally\nseen their like in the military. Men would save for months to get a set like\nthis, that wouldn’t warp in the rain.\nThe parshman looked so forlorn, staring down at his card, shoulders\nslumped.\n“This is wrong,” Kaladin whispered to Syl. “We’ve been so wrong.…”\nWhere were the destroyers? What had happened to the beasts with the red\neyes that had tried to crush Dalinar’s army? The terrible, haunting figures\nthat Bridge Four had described to him?\nWe thought we understood what was going to happen, Kaladin thought. I\nwas so sure.…\n“Alarm!” a sudden, shrill voice called. “Alarm! You fools!”\nSomething zipped through the air, a glowing yellow ribbon, a streak of\nlight in the dim afternoon shade.\n“He’s there,” the shrill voice said. “You’re being watched! Beneath those\nshrubs!”\nKaladin burst up through the underbrush, ready to suck in Stormlight and\nbe away. Though fewer towns had any now, as it was running out again, he\nhad a little left.\nThe parshmen seized cudgels made from branches or the handles of\nbrooms. They bunched together and held the sticks like frightened villagers,\nno stance, no control.\nKaladin hesitated. I could take them all in a fight even without\nStormlight. He’d seen men hold weapons like that many times before. Most\nrecently, he’d seen it inside the chasms, when training the bridgemen.\nThese were no warriors.\nSyl flitted up to him, prepared to become a Blade. “No,” Kaladin\nwhispered to her. Then he held his hands to the sides, speaking more loudly.\n“I surrender.”\n15. Brightness Radiant\nI will express only direct, even brutal, truth.

He lounged with his back against the\nwall, coat unbuttoned while tossing a small leather ball filled with dried\ngrain into the air and catching it again. “I just think the murders could have\nbeen done by two different people.”\n“Same exact method of murder,” Shallan said. “Body positioned the\nsame way.”\n“Nothing else connecting them,” Adolin said. “Sadeas was slime, widely\nhated, and usually accompanied by guards. Perel was quiet, well-liked, and\nknown for his administrative prowess. He was less a soldier than a\nmanager.”\nThe sun had fully set by now, and they’d set out spheres on the floor for\nlight. The remnants of their meal had been carted away by a servant, and\nPattern hummed happily on the wall near Adolin’s head. Adolin glanced at\nhim occasionally, looking uncomfortable, which she fully understood.\nShe’d grown used to Pattern, but his lines were strange.\nWait until Adolin sees a Cryptic in Shadesmar form, she thought, with a\nfull body but twisting shapes for his head.\nAdolin tossed the little stitched ball into the air and caught it with his\nright hand—the one that Renarin, amazingly, had healed. She wasn’t the\nonly one practicing with her powers. She was especially glad someone else\nhad a Shardblade now. When the highstorms returned, and they began\nworking the Oathgate in earnest, she’d have help.\n“These reports,” Shallan said, tapping the notebook against her hand,\n“are both informative and useless. Nothing connects Perel and Sadeas save\ntheir both being lighteyes—that and the part of the tower they were in.\nPerhaps mere opportunity drove the killer’s choice of victims.”\n“You’re saying someone happened to kill a highprince,” Adolin said, “by\naccident? Like … a back-alley murder outside a pub?”\n“Maybe. Brightness Aladar suggests in here that your father lay down\nsome rules on people moving alone through empty parts of the tower.”\n“I still think there might be two murderers,” Adolin said. “You know …\nlike someone saw Sadeas dead, and figured they could get away with killing\nsomeone else, blaming it on the first fellow.”\nOh, Adolin, Shallan thought. He’d arrived at a theory he liked, and now\nwouldn’t let it go. It was a common mistake warned of in her scientific\nbooks.\nAdolin did have one point—a highprince being murdered was unlikely to\nbe random chance. There were no signs of Sadeas’s Shardblade,\nOathbringer, being used by anyone, not even a rumor of it.\nMaybe the second death is a kind of decoy? Shallan thought, riffling\nthrough the report again. An attempt to make it seem like random attacks?\nNo, that was too convoluted—and she had no more evidence for it than\nAdolin had for his theory.\nThat did leave her thinking. Maybe everyone was paying attention to\nthese two deaths because they’d happened to important lighteyes. Could\nthere be other deaths they hadn’t noticed because they’d happened to less\nprominent individuals? If a beggar had been found in Adolin’s proverbial\nback alley behind a pub, would anyone have remarked upon it—even if\nhe’d been stabbed through the eye?"

If a beggar had been found in Adolin’s proverbial\nback alley behind a pub, would anyone have remarked upon it—even if\nhe’d been stabbed through the eye?\nI need to get out there among them and see what I can find. She opened\nher mouth to tell him she should probably turn in, but he was already\nstanding, stretching.\n“I think we’ve done what we can with that,” he said, nodding toward the\nreport. “At least for tonight.”\n“Yeah,” Shallan said, feigning a yawn. “Probably.”\n“So…” Adolin said, then took a deep breath. “There’s … something\nelse.”\nShallan frowned. Something else? Why did he suddenly look like he was\npreparing to do something difficult?\nHe’s going to break off our betrothal! a part of her mind thought, though\nshe pounced on that emotion and shoved it back behind the curtains where\nit belonged.\n“Okay, this isn’t easy,” Adolin said. “I don’t want to offend, Shallan.\nBut … you know how I had you eat that man’s food?”\n“Um, yes. If my tongue is particularly spicy in the coming days, I blame\nyou.”\n“Shallan, there’s something similar that we need to talk about.\nSomething about you we can’t just ignore.”\n“I…” I killed my parents. I stabbed my mother through the chest and I\nstrangled my father while singing to him.\n“You,” Adolin said, “have a Shardblade.”\nI didn’t want to kill her. I had to. I had to.\nAdolin grabbed her by the shoulders and she started, focusing on him.\nHe was … grinning?\n“You have a Shardblade, Shallan! A new one. That’s incredible. I\ndreamed for years of earning my Blade! So many men spend their lives\nwith that very dream and never see it fulfilled. And here you have one!”\n“And that’s a good thing, right?” she said, held in his grip with arms\npulled tight against her body.\n“Of course it is!” Adolin said, letting go of her. “But, I mean, you’re a\nwoman.”\n“Was it the makeup that tipped you off, or the dress? Oh, it was the\nbreasts, wasn’t it? Always giving us away.”\n“Shallan, this is serious.”\n“I know,” she said, calming her nerves. “Yes, Pattern can become a\nShardblade, Adolin. I don’t see what this has to do with anything. I can’t\ngive it away.… Stormfather. You want to teach me how to use it, don’t\nyou?”\nHe grinned. “You said that Jasnah was a Radiant too. Women, gaining\nShardblades. It’s weird, but it’s not like we can ignore it. What about Plate?\nDo you have that hidden somewhere too?”\n“Not that I know of,” she said. Her heart was beating quickly, her skin\ngrowing cold, her muscles tense. She fought against the sensation. “I don’t\nknow where Plate comes from.”\n“I know it’s not feminine, but who cares? You’ve got a sword; you\nshould know how to use it, and custom can go to Damnation. There, I said"

There, I said\nit.” He took a deep breath. “I mean, the bridgeboy can have one, and he’s\ndarkeyed. Well, he was. Anyway, it’s not so different from that.”\nThank you, Shallan thought, for ranking all women as something\nequivalent to peasants. But she held her tongue. This was obviously an\nimportant moment for Adolin, and he was trying to be broad-minded.\nBut … thinking of what she’d done pained her. Holding the weapon\nwould be worse. So much worse.\nShe wanted to hide. But she couldn’t. This truth refused to budge from\nher mind. Could she explain? “So, you’re right, but—”\n“Great!” Adolin said. “Great. I brought the Blade guards so we won’t\nhurt each other. I stashed them back at the guard post. I’ll go fetch them.”\nHe was out the door a moment later. Shallan stood with her hand\nstretched toward him, objections dying on her lips. She curled her fingers up\nand brought her hand to her breast, her heart thundering within.\n“Mmmm,” Pattern said. “This is good. This needs to be done.”\nShallan scrambled through the room to the small mirror she’d hung from\nthe wall. She stared at herself, eyes wide, hair an utter mess. She’d started\nbreathing in sharp, quick gasps. “I can’t—” she said. “I can’t be this person,\nPattern. I can’t just wield the sword. Some brilliant knight on a tower,\npretending she should be followed.”\nPattern hummed softly a tone she’d come to recognize as confusion. The\nbewilderment of one species trying to comprehend the mind of another.\nSweat trickled down Shallan’s face, running beside her eye as she stared\nat herself. What did she expect to see? The thought of breaking down in\nfront of Adolin heightened her tension. Her every muscle grew taut, and the\ncorners of her vision started to darken. She could see only before herself,\nand she wanted to run, go somewhere. Be away.\nNo. No, just be someone else.\nHands shaking, she scrambled over and dug out her drawing pad. She\nripped pages, flinging them out of the way to reach an empty one, then\nseized her charcoal pencil.\nPattern moved over to her, a floating ball of shifting lines, buzzing in\nconcern. “Shallan? Please. What is wrong?”\nI can hide, Shallan thought, drawing at a frenzied pace. Shallan can flee\nand leave someone in her place.\n“It’s because you hate me,” Pattern said softly. “I can die, Shallan. I can\ngo. They will send you another to bond.”\nA high-pitched whine started to rise in the room, one Shallan didn’t\nimmediately recognize as coming from the back of her own throat. Pattern’s\nwords were like knives to her side. No, please. Just draw.\nVeil. Veil would be fine holding a sword. She didn’t have Shallan’s\nbroken soul, and hadn’t killed her parents. She’d be able to do this."

She’d be able to do this.\nNo. No, what would Adolin do if he returned and found a completely\ndifferent woman in the room? He couldn’t know of Veil. The lines she\nsketched, ragged and unrefined from the shaking pencil, quickly took the\nshape of her own face. But hair in a bun. A poised woman, not as flighty as\nShallan, not as unintentionally silly.\nA woman who hadn’t been sheltered. A woman hard enough, strong\nenough, to wield this sword. A woman like … like Jasnah.\nYes, Jasnah’s subtle smile, composure, and self-confidence. Shallan\noutlined her own face with these ideals, creating a harder version of it.\nCould … could she be this woman?\nI have to be, Shallan thought, drawing in Stormlight from her satchel,\nthen breathing it out in a puff around her. She stood up as the change took\nhold. Her heartbeat slowed, and she wiped the sweat from her brow, then\ncalmly undid her safehand sleeve, tossed aside the foolish extra pouch she’d\ntied around her hand inside, then rolled the sleeve back to expose her still-\ngloved hand.\nGood enough. Adolin couldn’t possibly expect her to put on sparring\nclothing. She pulled her hair back into a bun and fixed it in place with\nhairspikes from her satchel.\nWhen Adolin returned to the room a moment later, he found a poised,\ncalm woman who wasn’t quite Shallan Davar. Brightness Radiant is her\nname, she thought. She will go only by title.\nAdolin carried two long, thin pieces of metal that somehow could meld\nto the front of Shardblades and make them less dangerous for use in\nsparring. Radiant inspected them with a critical eye, then held her hand to\nthe side, summoning Pattern. The Blade formed—a long, thin weapon\nnearly as tall as she was.\n“Pattern,” she said, “can modulate his shape, and will dull his edge to\nsafe levels. I shan’t need such a clunky device.” Indeed, Pattern’s edge\nrippled, dulling.\n“Storms, that’s handy. I’ll still need one though.” Adolin summoned his\nown Blade, a process that took him ten heartbeats—during which he turned\nhis head, looking at her.\nShallan glanced down, realizing that she’d enhanced her bust in this\nguise. Not for him, of course. She’d just been making herself look more like\nJasnah.\nAdolin’s sword finally appeared, with a thicker blade than her own,\nsinuous along the sharp edge, with delicate crystalline ridges along the\nback. He put one of the guards on the sword’s edge.\nRadiant put one foot forward, Blade lifted high in two hands beside her\nhead.\n“Hey,” Adolin said. “That’s not bad.”\n“Shallan did spend quite a lot of time drawing you all.”\nAdolin nodded thoughtfully. He approached and reached toward her with\na thumb and two fingers. She thought he was going to adjust her grip, but\ninstead he pressed his fingers against her collarbone and shoved lightly."

She thought he was going to adjust her grip, but\ninstead he pressed his fingers against her collarbone and shoved lightly.\nRadiant stumbled backward, almost tripping.\n“A stance,” Adolin said, “is about more than just looking great on the\nbattlefield. It’s about footing, center of balance, and control of the fight.”\n“Noted. So how do I make it better?”\n“I’m trying to decide. Everyone I’ve worked with before had been using\na sword since their youth. I’m wondering how Zahel would have changed\nmy training if I’d never even picked up a weapon.”\n“From what I’ve heard of him,” Radiant said, “It will depend on whether\nthere are any convenient rooftops nearby to jump off.”\n“That’s how he trained with Plate,” Adolin said. “This is Blade. Should I\nteach you dueling? Or should I teach you how to fight in an army?”\n“I shall settle,” Radiant said, “for knowing how to avoid cutting off any\nof my own appendages, Brightlord Kholin.”\n“Brightlord Kholin?”\nToo formal. Right. That was how Radiant would act, of course—but she\ncould allow herself some familiarity. Jasnah had done that.\n“I was merely,” Radiant said, “attempting to show the respect due a\nmaster from his humble pupil.”\nAdolin chuckled. “Please. We don’t need that. But here, let’s see what\nwe can do about that stance.…”\nOver the next hour, Adolin positioned her hands, her feet, and her arms a\ndozen times over. He picked a basic stance for her that she could eventually\nadapt into several of the formal stances—the ones like Windstance, which\nAdolin said wouldn’t rely on strength or reach as much as mobility and\nskill.\nShe wasn’t certain why he’d bothered fetching the metal sparring\nsleeves, as the two of them didn’t exchange any blows. Other than\ncorrecting her stance ten thousand times, he spoke about the art of the duel.\nHow to treat your Shardblade, how to think of an opponent, how to show\nrespect to the institutions and traditions of the duel itself.\nSome of it was very practical. Shardblades were dangerous weapons,\nwhich explained the demonstrations on how to hold hers, how to walk with\nit, how to take care not to slice people or things while casually turning.\nOther parts of his monologue were more … mystical.\n“The Blade is part of you,” Adolin said. “The Blade is more than your\ntool; it is your life. Respect it. It will not fail you—if you are bested, it is\nbecause you failed the sword.”\nRadiant stood in what felt like a very stiff pose, Blade held before herself\nin two hands. She’d only scraped Pattern on the ceiling two or three times;\nfortunately, most of the rooms in Urithiru had high ceilings.\nAdolin gestured for her to perform a simple strike, as they’d been\npracticing. Radiant raised both arms, tilting the sword, then took a step\nforward while bringing it down. The entire angle of movement couldn’t\nhave been more than ninety degrees—barely a strike at all.\nAdolin smiled. “You’re catching it. A few thousand more of those, and it"

A few thousand more of those, and it\nwill start to feel natural. We’ll have to work on your breathing though.”\n“My breathing?”\nHe nodded absently.\n“Adolin,” Radiant said, “I assure you, I have been breathing—without\nfail—my entire life.”\n“Yeah,” he said. “That’s why you’re going to have to unlearn it.”\n“How I stand, how I think, how I breathe. I have trouble distinguishing\nwhat is actually relevant, and what is part of the subculture and superstition\nof swordsmen.”\n“It’s all relevant,” Adolin said.\n“Eating chicken before a match?”\nAdolin grinned. “Well, maybe some things are personal quirks. But the\nswords are part of us.”\n“I know mine is part of me,” Radiant said, resting the Blade at her side\nand setting her gloved safehand on it. “I’ve bonded it. I suspect this is the\norigin of the tradition among Shardbearers.”\n“So academic,” Adolin said, shaking his head. “You need to feel this,\nShallan. Live it.”\nThat would not have been a difficult task for Shallan. Radiant, however,\npreferred not to feel things she hadn’t considered in depth beforehand.\n“Have you considered,” she said, “that your Shardblade was once a\nliving spren, wielded by one of the Knights Radiant? Doesn’t that change\nhow you look at it?”\nAdolin glanced toward his Blade, which he’d left summoned, strapped\nwith the sheath and set across her blankets. “I’ve always kind of known. Not\nthat it was alive. That’s silly. Swords aren’t alive. I mean … I’ve always\nknown there was something special about them. It’s part of being a duelist, I\nthink. We all know it.”\nShe let the matter drop. Swordsmen, from what she’d seen, were\nsuperstitious. As were sailors. As were … well, basically everyone but\nscholars like Radiant and Jasnah. It was curious to her how much of\nAdolin’s rhetoric about Blades and dueling reminded her of religion.\nHow strange that these Alethi often treated their actual religion so\nflippantly. In Jah Keved, Shallan had spent hours painting lengthy passages\nfrom the Arguments. You’d speak the words out loud over and over,\ncommitting them to memory while kneeling or bowing, before finally\nburning the paper. The Alethi instead preferred to let the ardents deal with\nthe Almighty, like he was some annoying parlor guest who could be safely\ndistracted by servants offering a particularly tasty tea.\nAdolin let her do some more strikes, perhaps sensing that she was\ngrowing tired of having her stance constantly adjusted. As she was\nswinging, he grabbed his own Blade and fell in beside her, modeling the\nstance and the strikes.\nAfter a short time of that she dismissed her Blade, then picked up her\nsketchbook. She quickly flipped past the drawing of Radiant, and started to\nsketch Adolin in his stance. She was forced to let some of Radiant bleed\naway.\n“No, stand there,” Shallan said, pointing at Adolin with her charcoal."

By now he’d removed his jacket, standing in only shirt and\ntrousers. She did like how that tight shirt fit him. Even Radiant would\nadmire that. She wasn’t dead, just pragmatic.\nShe looked over the two sketches, then resummoned Pattern and fell into\nposition.\n“Hey, nice,” Adolin said as Radiant performed the next few strikes.\n“Yeah, you’ve got it.”\nHe again fell in beside her. The simple attack he’d taught her was\nobviously a poor test of his skills, but he executed it with precision\nnonetheless, then grinned and started talking about the first few lessons he’d\nhad with Zahel long ago.\nHis blue eyes were alight, and Shallan loved seeing that glow from him.\nAlmost like Stormlight. She knew that passion—she’d felt what it was to be\nalive with interest, to be consumed by something so fully that you lost\nyourself in the wonder of it. For her it was art, but watching him, she\nthought that the two of them weren’t so different.\nSharing these moments with him and drinking of his excitement felt\nspecial. Intimate.

She let herself be Shallan in some of the moments, but whenever\nthe pain of holding the sword started to spike—whenever she really thought\nabout what she was doing—she was able to become Radiant and avoid it.\nShe was genuinely reluctant to see the time end, so she let it stretch into\nthe late evening, well past when she should have called a halt.

Elegant, relatively small—in that it was barely five feet long—\nit was thin and curved like a tusk. It had patterns only at the base of the\nblade near the hilt.\nHe’d lit it with four diamond broams, placed at the corners of the\naltarlike stone slab.

Often\naffixed at the pommel, though occasionally at the spot where hilt met blade,\nthe gem would flash when you first touched it, initiating the process. Keep\nthe Blade with you for a week, and the Blade became yours—dismissible\nand returnable in time with your heartbeat.\nThis Blade didn’t have one. Dalinar hesitantly reached out and rested his\nfingers on its silvery length. It was warm to the touch, like something alive.\n“It doesn’t scream when I touch it,” he noted.\nThe knights, the Stormfather said in his head, broke their oaths. They\nabandoned everything they’d sworn, and in so doing killed their spren.\nOther Blades are the corpses of those spren, which is why they scream at\nyour touch. This weapon, instead, was made directly from Honor’s soul,\nthen given to the Heralds. It is also the mark of an oath, but a different type\n—and does not have the mind to scream on its own.\n“And Shardplate?” Dalinar asked.\nRelated, but different, the Stormfather rumbled. You haven’t spoken the\noaths required to know more.\n“You cannot break oaths,” Dalinar said, fingers still resting on the\nHonorblade. “Right?”\nI cannot.\n“What of the thing we fight? Odium, the origin of the Voidbringers and\ntheir spren. Can he break oaths?”\nNo, the Stormfather said. He is far greater than I, but the power of\nancient Adonalsium permeates him. And controls him. Odium is a force like\npressure, gravitation, or the movement of time. These things cannot break\ntheir own rules. Nor can he.\nDalinar tapped the Honorblade. A fragment of Honor’s own soul,\ncrystallized into metallic form. In a way, the death of their god gave him\nhope—for if Honor had fallen, surely Odium could as well.\nIn visions, Honor had left Dalinar with a task. Vex Odium, convince him\nthat he can lose, and appoint a champion. He will take that chance instead\nof risking defeat again, as he has suffered so often. This is the best advice I\ncan give you.\n“I’ve seen that the enemy is preparing a champion,” Dalinar said. “A\ndark creature with red eyes and nine shadows. Will Honor’s suggestion\nwork? Can I make Odium agree to a decisive contest between me and that\nchampion?”\nOf course Honor’s suggestion would work, the Stormfather said. He\nspoke it.\n“I mean,” Dalinar said, “why would it work? Why would this Odium\never agree to a contest of champions? It seems too momentous a matter to\nrisk on something so small and inferior as the prowess and will of men.”\nYour enemy is not a man like you, the Stormfather replied, voice\nrumbling, thoughtful. Even … frightened. He does not age. He feels. He is\nangry. But this does not change, and his rage does not cool. Epochs can\npass, and he will remain the same."

Epochs can\npass, and he will remain the same.\nTo fight directly might coax out forces that could hurt him, as he has\nbeen hurt before. Those scars do not heal. To pick a champion, then lose,\nwill only cost him time. He has that in plenitude. He still will not agree\neasily, but it is possible he will agree. If presented with the option in the\nright moment, the right way. Then he will be bound.\n“And we win…”\nTime, the Stormfather said. Which, though dross to him, is the most\nvaluable thing a man can have.\nDalinar slipped the Honorblade off the slab. At the side of the room, a\nshaft cut into the ground. Two feet wide, it was one of many strange holes,\ncorridors, and hidden corners they’d found in the tower city. This one was\nprobably part of a sewage system; judging by the rust on the edges of the\nhole, there had once been a metal pipe here connecting the stone hole in the\nfloor to one in the ceiling.\nOne of Navani’s primary concerns was figuring out how all this worked.\nFor now, they’d gotten by using wooden frames to turn certain large,\ncommunal rooms with ancient baths into privies. Once they had more\nStormlight, their Soulcasters could deal with the waste, as they’d done in\nthe warcamps.\nNavani found the system inelegant. Communal privies with sometimes\nlong lines made for an inefficient city, and she claimed that these tubes\nindicated a widespread piping and sanitation system. It was exactly the sort\nof large-scale civic project that engaged her—he’d never known anyone to\nget as excited by sewage as Navani Kholin.\nFor now, this tube was empty. Dalinar knelt and lowered the sword into\nthe hole, sliding it into a stone sheath he’d cut in the side. The upper lip of\nthe hole shielded the protruding hilt from sight; you’d have to reach down\nand feel in the hole to find the Honorblade.\nHe stood up, then gathered his spheres and made his way out. He hated\nleaving it there, but he could think of nothing safer. His rooms didn’t feel\nsecure enough yet—he had no vault, and a crowd of guards would only\ndraw attention. Beyond Kaladin, Navani, and the Stormfather himself,\nnobody even knew that Dalinar had this. If he masked his movements, there\nwas virtually no chance of the Blade being discovered in this vacant portion\nof the tower.\nWhat will you do with it? the Stormfather asked as Dalinar entered the\nempty corridors. It is a weapon beyond parallel. The gift of a god. With it,\nyou would be a Windrunner unoathed. And more. More that men do not\nunderstand, and cannot. Like a Herald, nearly.\n“All the more reason,” Dalinar said, “to think very carefully before using\nit. Though I wouldn’t mind if you kept an eye on it for me.”\nThe Stormfather actually laughed. You think I can see all things?\n“I kind of assumed … The map we made…”\nI see what is left out in the storms, and that darkly. I am no god, Dalinar"

I am no god, Dalinar\nKholin. No more than your shadow on the wall is you.\nDalinar reached the steps downward, then wound around and around,\nholding a broam for light. If Captain Kaladin didn’t return soon, the\nHonorblade would provide another means of Windrunning—a way to get to\nThaylen City or Azir at speed. Or to get Elhokar’s team to Kholinar. The\nStormfather had also confirmed it could work Oathgates, which might prove\nhandy.\nDalinar reached more inhabited sections of the tower, which bustled with\nmovement. A chef’s assistants hauling supplies from the storage dump right\ninside the tower gates, a couple of men painting lines on the floor to guide,\nfamilies of soldiers in a particularly wide hallway, sitting on boxes along\nthe wall and watching children roll wooden spheres down a slope into a\nroom that had probably been another bath.\nLife. Such an odd place to make a home, yet they’d transformed the\nbarren Shattered Plains into one. This tower wouldn’t be so different,\nassuming they could keep farming operations going on the Shattered Plains.\nAnd assuming they had enough Stormlight to keep those Oathgates\nworking.\nHe was the odd man out, holding a sphere. Guards patrolled with\nlanterns. The cooks worked by lamp oil, but their stores were starting to run\nlow. The women watching children and darning socks used only the light of\na few windows along the wall here.\nDalinar passed near his rooms. Today’s guards, spearmen from Bridge\nThirteen, waited outside. He waved for them to follow him.\n“Is all well, Brightlord?” one asked, catching up quickly. He spoke with\na slow drawl—a Koron accent, from near the Sunmaker Mountains in\ncentral Alethkar.\n“Fine,” Dalinar said tersely, trying to determine the time. How long had\nhe spent speaking with the Stormfather?\n“Good, good,” the guard said, spear held lightly to his shoulder.\n“Wouldn’t want anything ta have happened ta you. While you were out.\nAlone. In the corridors. When you said nobody should be going about\nalone.”\nDalinar eyed the man. Clean-shaven, he was a little pale for an Alethi\nand had dark brown hair. Dalinar vaguely thought the man had shown up\namong his guards several times during the last week or so. He liked to roll a\nsphere across his knuckles in what Dalinar found to be a distracting way.\n“Your name?” Dalinar asked as they walked.\n“Rial,” the man said. “Bridge Thirteen.” The soldier raised a hand and\ngave a precise salute, so careful it could have been given by one of\nDalinar’s finest officers, except he maintained the same lazy expression.\n“Well, Sergeant Rial, I was not alone,” Dalinar said. “Where did you get\nthis habit of questioning officers?”\n“It isn’t a habit if you only do it once, Brightlord.”\n“And you’ve only ever done it once?”\n“Ta you?”\n“To anyone.”\n“Well,” Rial said, “those don’t count, Brightlord. I’m a new man. Reborn"

Reborn\nin the bridge crews.”\nLovely. “Well, Rial, do you know what time it is? I have trouble telling\nin these storming corridors.”\n“You could use the clock device Brightness Navani sent you, sir,” Rial\nsaid. “I think that’s what they’re for, you know.”\nDalinar affixed him with another glare.\n“Wasn’t questioning you, sir,” Rial said. “It wasn’t a question, see.…”\nDalinar finally turned and stalked back down the corridor to his rooms.\nWhere was that package Navani had given him? He found it on an end\ntable, and from inside it removed a leather bracer somewhat like what an\narcher would wear. It had two clock faces set into the top. One showed the\ntime with three hands—even seconds, as if that mattered. The other was a\nstormclock, which could be set to wind down to the next projected\nhighstorm.\nHow did they get it all so small? he wondered, shaking the device. Set\ninto the leather, it also had a painrial—a gemstone fabrial that would take\npain from him if he pressed his hand on it. Navani had been working on\nvarious forms of pain-related fabrials for use by surgeons, and had\nmentioned using him as a test subject.\nHe strapped the device to his forearm, right above the wrist. It felt\nconspicuous there, wrapping around the outside of his uniform sleeve, but it\nhad been a gift. In any case, he had an hour until his next scheduled\nmeeting. Time to work out some of his restless energy. He collected his two\nguards, then made his way down a level to one of the larger chambers near\nwhere he housed his soldiers.\nThe room had black and grey strata on the walls, and was filled with men\ntraining. They all wore Kholin blue, even if just an armband. For now both\nlighteyes and dark practiced in the same chamber, sparring in rings with\npadded cloth mats.\nAs always, the sounds and smells of sparring warmed Dalinar. Sweeter\nthan the scent of flatbread baking was that of oiled leather. More welcoming\nthan the sound of flutes was that of practice swords rapping against one\nanother. Wherever he was, and whatever station he obtained, a place like\nthis would always be home.\nHe found the swordmasters assembled at the back wall, seated on\ncushions and supervising their students. Save for one notable exception,\nthey all had squared beards, shaved heads, and simple, open-fronted robes\nthat tied at the waist. Dalinar owned ardents who were experts in all manner\nof specialties, and per tradition any man or woman could come to them and\nbe apprenticed in a new skill or trade. The swordmasters, however, were his\npride.\nFive of the six men rose and bowed to him. Dalinar turned to survey the\nroom again. The smell of sweat, the clang of weapons. They were the signs\nof preparation. The world might be in chaos, but Alethkar prepared.\nNot Alethkar, he thought. Urithiru. My kingdom. Storms, it was going to"

Storms, it was going to\nbe difficult to accustom himself to that. He would always be Alethi, but\nonce Elhokar’s proclamation came out, Alethkar would no longer be his. He\nstill hadn’t figured out how to present that fact to his armies. He wanted to\ngive Navani and her scribes time to work out the exact legalities.\n“You’ve done well here,” Dalinar said to Kelerand, one of the\nswordmasters. “Ask Ivis if she’d look at expanding the training quarters\ninto adjacent chambers. I want you to keep the troops busy. I’m worried\nabout them getting restless and starting more fights.”\n“It will be done, Brightlord,” Kelerand said, bowing.\n“I’d like a spar myself,” Dalinar said.\n“I shall find someone suitable, Brightlord.”\n“What about you, Kelerand?” Dalinar said. The swordmaster bested\nDalinar two out of three times, and though Dalinar had given up delusions\nof someday becoming the better swordsman—he was a soldier, not a duelist\n—he liked the challenge.\n“I will,” Kelerand said stiffly, “of course do as my highprince\ncommands, though if given a choice, I shall pass. With all due respect, I\ndon’t feel that I would make a suitable match for you today.”\nDalinar glanced toward the other standing swordmasters, who lowered\ntheir eyes. Swordmaster ardents weren’t generally like their more religious\ncounterparts. They could be formal at times, but you could laugh with them.\nUsually.\nThey were still ardents though.\n“Very well,” Dalinar said. “Find me someone to fight.”\nThough he’d intended it only as a dismissal of Kelerand, the other four\njoined him, leaving Dalinar. He sighed, leaning back against the wall, and\nglanced to the side. One man still lounged on his cushion. He wore a scruffy\nbeard and clothing that seemed an afterthought—not dirty, but ragged,\nbelted with rope.\n“Not offended by my presence, Zahel?” Dalinar asked.\n“I’m offended by everyone’s presence. You’re no more revolting than the\nrest, Mister Highprince.”\nDalinar settled down on a stool to wait.\n“You didn’t expect this?” Zahel said, sounding amused.\n“No. I thought … well, they’re fighting ardents. Swordsmen. Soldiers, at\nheart.”\n“You’re dangerously close to threatening them with a decision,\nBrightlord: choose between God and their highprince. The fact that they\nlike you doesn’t make the decision easier, but more difficult.”\n“Their discomfort will pass,” Dalinar said. “My marriage, though it\nseems dramatic now, will eventually be a mere trivial note in history.”\n“Perhaps.”\n“You disagree?”\n“Every moment in our lives seems trivial,” Zahel said. “Most are\nforgotten while some, equally humble, become the points upon which\nhistory pivots. Like white on black.”\n“White … on black?” Dalinar asked.\n“Figure of speech.

I don’t really care what you did, Highprince.\nLighteyed self-indulgence or serious sacrilege, either way it doesn’t affect\nme. But there are those who are asking how far you’re going to end up\nstraying.”\nDalinar grunted. Honestly, had he expected Zahel of all people to be\nhelpful? He stood up and began to pace, annoyed at his own nervous\nenergy. Before the ardents could return with someone for him to duel, he\nstalked back into the middle of the room, looking for soldiers he\nrecognized. Men who wouldn’t feel inhibited sparring with a highprince.\nHe eventually located one of General Khal’s sons. Not the Shardbearer,\nCaptain Halam Khal, but the next oldest son—a beefy man with a head that\nhad always seemed a little too small for his body. He was stretching after\nsome wrestling matches.\n“Aratin,” Dalinar said. “You ever sparred with a highprince?”\nThe younger man turned, then immediately snapped to attention. “Sir?”\n“No need for formality. I’m just looking for a match.”\n“I’m not equipped for a proper duel, Brightlord,” he said. “Give me\nsome time.”\n“No need,” Dalinar said. “I’m fine for a wrestling match. It’s been too\nlong.”\nSome men would rather not spar with a man as important as Dalinar, for\nfear of hurting him. Khal had trained his sons better than that. The young\nman grinned, displaying a prominent gap in his teeth. “Fine with me,\nBrightlord. But I’ll have you know, I’ve not lost a match in months.”\n“Good,” Dalinar said. “I need a challenge.”\nThe swordmasters finally returned as Dalinar, stripped to the waist, was\npulling on a pair of sparring leggings over his undershorts. The tight\nleggings came down only to his knees. He nodded to the swordmasters—\nignoring the gentlemanly lighteyes they’d sought out for him to spar—and\nstepped into the wrestling ring with Aratin Khal.\nHis guards gave the swordmasters a kind of apologetic shrug, then Rial\ncounted off a start to the wrestling match. Dalinar immediately lunged\nforward and slammed into Khal, grabbing him under the arms, struggling to\nhold his feet back and force his opponent off balance. The wrestling match\nwould eventually go to the ground, but you wanted to be the one who\ncontrolled when and how that happened.\nThere was no grabbing the leggings in a traditional vehah match, and of\ncourse no grabbing hair, so Dalinar twisted, trying to get his opponent into a\nsturdy hold while preventing the man from shoving Dalinar over. Dalinar\nscrambled, his muscles taut, his fingers slipping on his opponent’s skin.\nFor those frantic moments, he could focus only on the match. His\nstrength against that of his opponent. Sliding his feet, twisting his weight,\nstraining for purchase. There was a purity to the contest, a simplicity that he\nhadn’t experienced in what seemed like ages.\nAratin pulled Dalinar tight, then managed to twist, tripping Dalinar over\nhis hip.

Old training prompted him to\ntwist and writhe before the opponent could get a good grip on him.\nToo slow. It had been years since he’d done this regularly. The other man\nmoved with Dalinar’s twist, forgoing the attempt at a chokehold, instead\ngetting Dalinar under the arms from behind and pressing him down, face\nagainst the mat, his weight on top of Dalinar.\nDalinar growled, and by instinct reached out for that extra reserve he’d\nalways had. The pulse of the fight, the edge.\nThe Thrill. Soldiers spoke of it in the quiet of the night, over campfires.\nThat battle rage unique to the Alethi. Some called it the power of their\nancestors, others the true mindset of the soldier. It had driven the Sunmaker\nto glory. It was the open secret of Alethi success.\nNo. Dalinar stopped himself from reaching for it, but he needn’t have\nworried. He couldn’t remember feeling the Thrill in months—and the\nlonger he’d been apart from it, the more he’d begun to recognize that there\nwas something profoundly wrong about the Thrill.\nSo he gritted his teeth and struggled—cleanly and fairly—with his\nopponent.\nAnd got pinned.\nAratin was younger, more practiced at this style of fight. Dalinar didn’t\nmake it easy, but he was on the bottom, lacked leverage, and simply wasn’t\nas young as he’d once been. Aratin twisted him over, and before too long\nDalinar found himself pressed to the mat, shoulders down, completely\nimmobilized.\nDalinar knew he was beaten, but couldn’t bring himself to tap out.\nInstead he strained against the hold, teeth gritted and sweat pouring down\nthe sides of his face. He became aware of something. Not the Thrill … but\nStormlight in the pocket of his uniform trousers, lying beside the ring.\nAratin grunted, arms like steel. Dalinar smelled his own sweat, the rough\ncloth of the mat. His muscles protested the treatment.\nHe knew he could seize the Stormlight power, but his sense of fairness\nprotested at the mere thought. Instead he arched his back, holding his breath\nand heaving with everything he had, then twisted, trying to get back on his\nface for the leverage to escape.\nHis opponent shifted. Then groaned, and Dalinar felt the man’s grip\nslipping … slowly.…\n“Oh, for storm’s sake,” a feminine voice said. “Dalinar?”\nDalinar’s opponent let go immediately, backing away. Dalinar twisted,\npuffing from exertion, to find Navani standing outside the ring with arms\nfolded. He grinned at her, then stood up and accepted a light takama\novershirt and towel from an aide. As Aratin Khal retreated, Dalinar raised a\nfist to him and bowed his head—a sign that Dalinar considered Aratin the\nvictor. “Well played, son.”\n“An honor, sir!”\nDalinar threw on the takama, turning to Navani and wiping his brow\nwith the towel. “Come to watch me spar?”\n“Yes, what every wife loves,” Navani said. “Seeing that in his spare"

Best to fight at a disadvantage here to prepare.” He\nhesitated, then said more softly, “I think I almost had him anyway.”\n“Your definition of ‘almost’ is particularly ambitious, gemheart.”\nDalinar accepted a waterskin from an aide. Though Navani and her aides\nweren’t the only women in the room, the others were ardents. Navani in her\nbright yellow gown still stood out like a flower on a barren stone field.\nAs Dalinar scanned the chamber, he found that many of the ardents—not\njust the swordmasters—failed to meet his gaze. And there was Kadash, his\nformer comrade-in-arms, speaking with the swordmasters.\nNearby, Aratin was receiving congratulations from his friends. Pinning\nthe Blackthorn was considered quite the accomplishment. The young man\naccepted their praise with a grin, but he held his shoulder and winced when\nsomeone slapped him on the back.\nI should have tapped out, Dalinar thought. Pushing the contest had\nendangered them both. He was annoyed at himself. He’d specifically chosen\nsomeone younger and stronger, then became a poor loser? Getting older\nwas something he needed to accept, and he was kidding himself if he\nactually thought this would help him on the battlefield. He’d given away his\narmor, no longer carried a Shardblade. When exactly did he expect to be\nfighting in person again?\nThe man with nine shadows.\nThe water suddenly tasted stale in his mouth. He’d been expecting to\nfight the enemy’s champion himself, assuming he could even make the\ncontest happen to their advantage. But wouldn’t assigning the duty to\nsomeone like Kaladin make far more sense?\n“Well,” Navani said, “you might want to throw on a uniform. The Iriali\nqueen is ready.”\n“The meeting isn’t for a few hours.”\n“She wants to do it now. Apparently, her court tidereader saw something\nin the waves that means an earlier meeting is better. She should be\ncontacting us any minute.”\nStorming Iriali. Still, they had an Oathgate—two, if you counted the one\nin the kingdom of Rira, which Iri had sway over. Among Iri’s three\nmonarchs, currently two kings and a queen, the latter had authority over\nforeign policy, so she was the one they needed to talk to.\n“I’m fine with moving up the time,” Dalinar said.\n“I’ll await you in the writing chamber.”\n“Why?” Dalinar said, waving a hand. “It’s not like she can see me. Set\nup here.”\n“Here,” Navani said flatly.\n“Here,” Dalinar said, feeling stubborn. “I’ve had enough of cold\nchambers, silent save for the scratching of reeds.”\nNavani raised an eyebrow at him, but ordered her assistants to get out"

Common longswords of unsharpened steel. He tossed\none to Kadash, who caught it smoothly, but then placed it in front of him\nwith point down, resting his hands on the pommel.\n“Brightlord,” Kadash said, “I would prefer to give this task to another, as\nI don’t particularly feel—”\n“Tough,” Dalinar said. “I need some practice, Kadash. As your master, I\ndemand you give it to me.”\nKadash stared at Dalinar for a protracted moment, then let out an\nannoyed huff and followed Dalinar to the ring. “I won’t be much of a match\nfor you, Brightlord. I have dedicated my years to scripture, not the sword. I\nwas only here to—”\n“—check up on me. I know. Well, maybe I’ll be rusty too. I haven’t\nfought with a common longsword in decades. I always had something\nbetter.”\n“Yes. I remember when you first got your Blade. The world itself\ntrembled on that day, Dalinar Kholin.”\n“Don’t be melodramatic,” Dalinar said. “I was merely one in a long line\nof idiots given the ability to kill people too easily.”\nRial hesitantly counted the start to the match, and Dalinar rushed in\nswinging. Kadash rebuffed him competently, then stepped to the side of the\nring. “Pardon, Brightlord, but you were different from the others. You were\nmuch, much better at the killing part.”\nI always have been, Dalinar thought, rounding Kadash. It was odd to\nremember the ardent as one of his elites. They hadn’t been close then;\nthey’d only become so during Kadash’s years as an ardent.\nNavani cleared her throat. “Hate to interrupt this stick-wagging,” she\nsaid, “but the queen is ready to speak with you, Dalinar.”\n“Great,” he said, not taking his eyes off Kadash. “Read me what she\nsays.”\n“While you’re sparring?”\n“Sure.”\nHe could practically feel Navani roll her eyes. He grinned, coming in at\nKadash again. She thought he was being silly. Perhaps he was.\nHe was also failing. One at a time, the world’s monarchs were shutting\nhim out. Only Taravangian of Kharbranth—known to be slow witted—had\nagreed to listen to him. Dalinar was doing something wrong.

The time for the world to\nundergo a glorious new experience has arrived.’ ”\n“Glorious, Your Majesty?” Dalinar said, swiping at Kadash’s leg.

Swords rang loudly.\n“I hadn’t realized,” Navani noted, “that she was so religious.”\n“Pagan superstition,” Kadash said, sliding back across the mat from\nDalinar. “At least the Azish have the decency to worship the Heralds,\nalthough they blasphemously place them above the Almighty. The Iriali are\nno better than Shin shamans.”\n“I remember, Kadash,” Dalinar said, “when you weren’t nearly so\njudgmental.”\n“I’ve been informed that my laxness might have served to encourage\nyou.”\n“I always found your perspective to be refreshing.” He stared right at\nKadash, but spoke to Navani. “Tell her: Your Majesty, as much as I\nwelcome a challenge, I fear the suffering these new … experiences will\nbring. We must be unified in the face of the coming dangers.”\n“Unity,” Kadash said softly. “If that is your goal, Dalinar, then why do\nyou seek to rip apart your own people?”\nNavani started writing. Dalinar drew closer, passing his longsword from\none hand to the other. “How do you know, Kadash? How do you know the\nIriali are the pagans?”\nKadash frowned. Though he wore the square beard of an ardent, that scar\non his head wasn’t the only thing that set him apart from his fellows. They\ntreated swordplay like just another art. Kadash had the haunted eyes of a\nsoldier. When he dueled, he kept watch to the sides, in case someone tried\nto flank him. An impossibility in a solo duel, but all too likely on a\nbattlefield.\n“How can you ask that, Dalinar?”\n“Because it should be asked,” Dalinar said. “You claim the Almighty is\nGod. Why?”\n“Because he simply is.”\n“That isn’t good enough for me,” Dalinar said, realizing for the first time\nit was true. “Not anymore.”\nThe ardent growled, then leaped in, attacking with real determination\nthis time. Dalinar danced backward, fending him off, as Navani read—\nloudly.\n“ ‘Highprince, I will be frank. The Iriali Triumvirate is in agreement.\nAlethkar has not been relevant in the world since the Sunmaker’s fall. The\npower of the ones who control the new storm, however, is undeniable. They\noffer gracious terms.’ ”\nDalinar stopped in place, dumbfounded. “You’d side with the\nVoidbringers?” he asked toward Navani, but then was forced to defend"

        "text": "offer gracious terms.’ ”\nDalinar stopped in place, dumbfounded. “You’d side with the\nVoidbringers?” he asked toward Navani, but then was forced to defend\nhimself from Kadash, who hadn’t let up.\n“What?” Kadash said, clanging his blade against Dalinar’s. “Surprised\nsomeone is willing to side with evil, Dalinar? That someone would pick\ndarkness, superstition, and heresy instead of the Almighty’s light?”\n“I am not a heretic.” Dalinar slapped Kadash’s blade away—but not\nbefore the ardent scored a touch on Dalinar’s arm. The hit was hard, and\nthough the swords were blunted, that would bruise for certain.\n“You just told me you doubted the Almighty,” Kadash said. “What is\nleft, after that?”\n“I don’t know,” Dalinar said. He stepped closer. “I don’t know, and that\nterrifies me, Kadash. But Honor spoke to me, confessed that he was\nbeaten.”\n“The princes of the Voidbringers,” Kadash said, “were said to be able to\nblind the eyes of men. To send them lies, Dalinar.”\nHe rushed in, swinging, but Dalinar danced back, retreating around the\nrim of the dueling ring.\n“ ‘My people,’ ” Navani said, reading the reply from the queen of Iri, “\n‘do not want war. Perhaps the way to prevent another Desolation is to let\nthe Voidbringers take what they wish. From our histories, sparse though\nthey are, it seems that this was the one option men never explored. An\nexperience from the One we rejected.’ ”\nNavani looked up, obviously as surprised to read the words as Dalinar\nwas to hear them. The pen kept writing. “ ‘Beyond that,’ ” she added, “ ‘we\nhave reasons to distrust the word of a thief, Highprince Kholin.’ ”\nDalinar groaned. So that was what this was all about—Adolin’s\nShardplate. Dalinar glanced at Navani. “Find out more, try to console\nthem?”\nShe nodded, and started writing. Dalinar gritted his teeth and charged\nKadash again. The ardent caught his sword, then grabbed his takama with\nhis free hand, pulling him close, face to face.\n“The Almighty is not dead,” Kadash hissed.\n“Once, you’d have counseled me. Now you glare at me. What happened\nto the ardent I knew? A man who had lived a real life, not just watched the\nworld from high towers and monasteries?”\n“He’s frightened,” Kadash said softly. “That he’s somehow failed in his\nmost solemn duty to a man he deeply admires.”\nThey met eyes, their swords still locked, but neither one actually trying\nto push the other. For a moment, Dalinar saw in Kadash the man he’d\nalways been. The gentle, understanding model of everything good about the\nVorin church.\n“Give me something to take back to the curates of the church,” Kadash\npled. “Recant your insistence that the Almighty is dead. If you do that, I can\nmake them accept the marriage. Kings have done worse and retained Vorin\nsupport.”\nDalinar set his jaw, then shook his head.\n“Dalinar…”"

Kings have done worse and retained Vorin\nsupport.”\nDalinar set his jaw, then shook his head.\n“Dalinar…”\n“Falsehoods serve nobody, Kadash,” Dalinar said, pulling back. “If the\nAlmighty is dead, then pretending otherwise is pure stupidity. We need real\nhope, not faith in lies.”\nAround the room, more than a few men had stopped their bouts to watch\nor listen. The swordmasters had stepped up behind Navani, who was still\nexchanging some politic words with the Iriali queen.\n“Don’t throw out everything we’ve believed because of a few dreams,\nDalinar,” Kadash said. “What of our society, what of tradition?”\n“Tradition?” Dalinar said. “Kadash, did I ever tell you about my first\nsword trainer?”\n“No,” Kadash said, frowning, glancing at the other ardents. “Was it\nRembrinor?”\nDalinar shook his head. “Back when I was young, our branch of the\nKholin family didn’t have grand monasteries and beautiful practice\ngrounds. My father found a teacher for me from two towns over. His name\nwas Harth. Young fellow, not a true swordmaster—but good enough.\n“He was very focused on proper procedure, and wouldn’t let me train\nuntil I’d learned how to put on a takama the right way.” Dalinar gestured at\nthe takama shirt he was wearing. “He wouldn’t have stood for me fighting\nlike this. You put on the skirt, then the overshirt, then you wrap your cloth\nbelt around yourself three times and tie it.\n“I always found that annoying. The belt was too tight, wrapped three\ntimes—you had to pull it hard to get enough slack to tie the knot. The first\ntime I went to duels at a neighboring town, I felt like an idiot. Everyone else\nhad long drooping belt ends at the front of their takamas.\n“I asked Harth why we did it differently. He said it was the right way, the\ntrue way. So, when my travels took me to Harth’s hometown, I searched out\nhis master, a man who had trained with the ardents in Kholinar. He insisted\nthat this was the right way to tie a takama, as he’d learned from his master.”\nBy now, they’d drawn an even larger crowd. Kadash frowned. “And the\npoint?”\n“I found my master’s master’s master in Kholinar after we captured it,”\nDalinar said. “The ancient, wizened ardent was eating curry and flatbread,\ncompletely uncaring of who ruled the city. I asked him. Why tie your belt\nthree times, when everyone else thinks you should do it twice?\n“The old man laughed and stood up. I was shocked to see that he was\nterribly short. ‘If I only tie it twice,’ he exclaimed, ‘the ends hang down so\nlow, I trip!’ ”\nThe chamber fell silent. Nearby, one soldier chuckled, but quickly cut\nhimself off—none of the ardents seemed amused.\n“I love tradition,” Dalinar said to Kadash. “I’ve fought for tradition. I\nmake my men follow the codes. I uphold Vorin virtues. But merely being\ntradition does not make something worthy, Kadash. We can’t just assume\nthat because something is old it is right.”"

We can’t just assume\nthat because something is old it is right.”\nHe turned to Navani.\n“She’s not listening,” Navani said. “She insists you are a thief, not to be\ntrusted.”\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “I am led to believe that you would let\nnations fall, and men be slaughtered, because of a petty grievance from the\npast. If my relations with the kingdom of Rira are prompting you to\nconsider supporting the enemies of all humankind, then perhaps we could\ndiscuss a personal reconciliation first.”\nNavani nodded at that, though she glanced at the people watching and\ncocked an eyebrow. She thought all this should have been done in private.\nWell, perhaps she was right. At the same time, Dalinar felt he’d needed this.\nHe couldn’t explain why.\nHe raised his sword to Kadash in a sign of respect. “Are we done here?”\nIn response, Kadash came running at him, sword raised. Dalinar sighed,\nthen let himself get touched on the left, but ended the exchange with his\nweapon leveled at Kadash’s neck.\n“That’s not a valid dueling strike,” the ardent said.\n“I’m not much of a duelist these days.”\nThe ardent grunted, then shoved away Dalinar’s weapon and lunged at\nhim. Dalinar, however, caught Kadash’s arm, then spun the man with his\nown momentum. He slammed Kadash down to the ground and held him\nthere.\n“The world is ending, Kadash,” Dalinar said. “I can’t simply rely on\ntradition. I need to know why. Convince me. Offer me proof of what you\nsay.”\n“You shouldn’t need proof in the Almighty. You sound like your niece!”\n“I’ll take that as a compliment.”\n“What … what of the Heralds?” Kadash said. “Do you deny them,\nDalinar? They were servants of the Almighty, and their existence proved\nhis. They had power.”\n“Power?” Dalinar said. “Like this?”\nHe sucked in Stormlight. Murmuring rose from those watching as\nDalinar began to glow, then did … something else. Commanded the Light.\nWhen he rose, he left Kadash stuck to the ground in a pool of Radiance that\nheld him fast, binding him to the stone. The ardent wriggled, helpless.\n“The Knights Radiant have returned,” Dalinar said. “And yes, I accept\nthe authority of the Heralds. I accept that there was a being, once, named\nHonor—the Almighty. He helped us, and I would welcome his help again.\nIf you can prove to me that Vorinism as it currently stands is what the\nHeralds taught, we will speak again.”\nHe tossed his sword aside and stepped up to Navani.\n“Nice show,” she said softly. “That was for the room, not just Kadash, I\nassume?”\n“The soldiers need to know where I stand in relation to the church. What\ndoes our queen say?”\n“Nothing good,” she muttered. “She says you can contact her with\narrangements for the return of the stolen goods, and she’ll consider.”\n“Storming woman,” Dalinar said. “She’s after Adolin’s Shardplate.

How\nvalid is her claim?”\n“Not very,” Navani said. “You got that through marriage, and to a\nlighteyes from Rira, not Iri. Yes, the Iriali claim their sister nation as a\nvassal, but even if the claim weren’t disputed, the queen doesn’t have any\nactual relation to Evi or her brother.”\nDalinar grunted. “Rira was never strong enough to try to claim the Plate\nback. But if it will bring Iri to our side, then I’d consider it. Maybe I can\nagree to…” He trailed off. “Wait. What did you say?”\n“Hum?” Navani said. “About … oh, right. You can’t hear her name.”\n“Say it again,” Dalinar whispered.\n“What?” Navani said. “Evi?”\nMemories blossomed in Dalinar’s head. He staggered, then slumped\nagainst the writing table, feeling as if he’d been struck by a hammer to the\nhead. Navani called for physicians, implying his dueling had overtaxed him.\nThat wasn’t it. Instead, it was the burning in his mind, the sudden shock\nof a word spoken.\nEvi. He could hear his wife’s name.\nAnd he suddenly remembered her face.\n17. Trapped in Shadows\nIt is not a lesson I claim to be able to teach. Experience herself is the\ngreat teacher, and you must seek her directly.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\n“I still think we should kill him,” Khen—the parshwoman who had been\nplaying cards—said to the others.\nKaladin sat tied and bound to a tree. He’d spent the night there. They’d\nlet him up several times to use the latrine today, but otherwise kept him\nbound. Though their knots were good, they always posted guards, even\nthough he’d turned himself in to them in the first place.\nHis muscles were stiff, and the posture was uncomfortable, but he had\nendured worse as a slave. Almost the entire afternoon had passed so far—\nand they were still arguing about him.\nHe didn’t see that yellow-white spren again, the one that had been a\nribbon of light. He almost thought he’d imagined it. At least the rain had\nfinally stopped. Hopefully that meant the highstorms—and Stormlight—\nwere close to returning.\n“Kill him?” another of the parshmen said. “Why? What danger is he to\nus?”\n“He’ll tell others where we are.”\n“He found us easily enough on his own. I doubt others will have trouble,\nKhen.”\nThe parshmen didn’t seem to have a specific leader. Kaladin could hear\nthem talking from where they stood, huddled together beneath a tarp. The\nair smelled wet, and the clump of trees shivered when a gust of wind blew\nthrough. A shower of water drops came down on top of him, somehow more\ncold than the Weeping itself.\nSoon, blessedly, this would all dry up and he could finally see the sun\nagain.\n“So we let him go?” Khen asked. She had a gruff voice, angry.\n“I don’t know. Would you actually do it, Khen? Bash his head in\nyourself?”"

Bash his head in\nyourself?”\nThe tent fell silent.\n“If it means they can’t take us again?” she said. “Yes, I’d kill him. I\nwon’t go back, Ton.”\nThey had simple, darkeyed Alethi names—matched by their\nuncomfortably familiar accents. Kaladin didn’t worry for his safety; though\nthey’d taken his knife, spanreed, and spheres, he could summon Syl at a\nmoment’s notice. She flitted nearby on gusts of wind, dodging between the\nbranches of trees.\nThe parshmen eventually left their conference, and Kaladin dozed. He\nwas later roused by the noise of them gathering up their meager belongings:\nan axe or two, some waterskins, the nearly ruined bags of grain. As the sun\nset, long shadows stretched across Kaladin, plunging the camp into\ndarkness again. It seemed that the group moved at night.\nThe tall male who had been playing cards the night before approached\nKaladin, who recognized the pattern of his skin. He untied the ropes binding\nKaladin to the tree, the ones around his ankles—but left the bonds on\nKaladin’s hands.\n“You could capture that card,” Kaladin noted.\nThe parshman stiffened.\n“The card game,” Kaladin said. “The squire can capture if supported by\nan allied card. So you were right.”\nThe parshman grunted, yanking on the rope to tow Kaladin to his feet.\nHe stretched, working stiff muscles and painful cramps, as the other\nparshmen broke down the last of the improvised tarp tents: the one that had\nbeen fully enclosed. Earlier in the day, though, Kaladin had gotten a look at\nwhat was inside.\nChildren.\nThere were a dozen of them, dressed in smocks, of various ages from\ntoddler to young teenager. The females wore their hair loose, and the males\nwore theirs tied or braided. They hadn’t been allowed to leave the tent\nexcept at a few carefully supervised moments, but he had heard them\nlaughing. He’d first worried they were captured human children.\nAs the camp broke, they scattered about, excited to finally be released.\nOne younger girl scampered across the wet stones and seized the empty\nhand of the man leading Kaladin. Each of the children bore the distinctive\nlook of their elders—the not-quite-Parshendi appearance with the armored\nportions on the sides of their heads and forearms. For the children, the color\nof the carapace was a light orange-pink.\nKaladin couldn’t define why this sight seemed so strange to him.\nParshmen did breed, though people often spoke of them being bred, like\nanimals. And, well, that wasn’t far from the truth, was it? Everyone knew it.\nWhat would Shen—Rlain—think if Kaladin had said those words out\nloud?\nThe procession moved out of the trees, Kaladin led by his ropes. They\nkept talk to a minimum, and as they crossed through a field in the darkness,\nKaladin had a distinct impression of familiarity. Had he been here before,\ndone this before?"

Had he been here before,\ndone this before?\n“What about the king?” his captor said, speaking in a soft voice, but\nturning his head to direct the question at Kaladin.\nElhokar? What … Oh, right. The cards.\n“The king is one of the most powerful cards you can place,” Kaladin\nsaid, struggling to remember all the rules. “He can capture any other card\nexcept another king, and can’t be captured himself unless touched by three\nenemy cards of knight or better. Um … and he is immune to the\nSoulcaster.” I think.\n“When I watched men play, they used this card rarely. If it is so\npowerful, why delay?”\n“If your king gets captured, you lose,” Kaladin said. “So you only play\nhim if you’re desperate or if you are certain you can defend him. Half the\ntimes I’ve played, I left him in my barrack all game.”\nThe parshman grunted, then looked to the girl at his side, who tugged on\nhis arm and pointed. He gave her a whispered response, and she ran on\ntiptoes toward a patch of flowering rockbuds, visible by the light of the first\nmoon.\nThe vines pulled back, blossoms closing. The girl, however, knew to\nsquat at the side and wait, hands poised, until the flowers reopened—then\nshe snatched one in each hand, her giggles echoing across the plain.\nJoyspren followed her like blue leaves as she returned, giving Kaladin a\nwide berth.\nKhen, walking with a cudgel in her hands, urged Kaladin’s captor to\nkeep moving. She watched the area with the nervousness of a scout on a\ndangerous mission.\nThat’s it, Kaladin thought, remembering why this felt familiar. Sneaking\naway from Tasinar.\nIt had happened after he’d been condemned by Amaram, but before he’d\nbeen sent to the Shattered Plains. He avoided thinking of those months. His\nrepeated failures, the systematic butchering of his last hints of idealism …\nwell, he’d learned that dwelling on such things took him to dark places.\nHe’d failed so many people during those months. Nalma had been one of\nthose. He could remember the touch of her hand in his: a rough, callused\nhand.\nThat had been his most successful escape attempt. It had lasted five days.\n“You’re not monsters,” Kaladin whispered. “You’re not soldiers. You’re\nnot even the seeds of the void. You’re just … runaway slaves.”\nHis captor spun, yanking on Kaladin’s rope. The parshman seized\nKaladin by the front of his uniform, and his daughter hid behind his leg,\ndropping one of her flowers and whimpering.\n“Do you want me to kill you?” the parshman asked, pulling Kaladin’s\nface close to his own. “You insist on reminding me how your kind see us?”\nKaladin grunted. “Look at my forehead, parshman.”\n“And?”\n“Slave brands.”\n“What?”\nStorms … parshmen weren’t branded, and they didn’t mix with other\nslaves.

Parshmen were actually too valuable for that. “When they make a\nhuman into a slave,” Kaladin said, “they brand him. I’ve been here. Right\nwhere you are.”\n“And you think that makes you understand?”\n“Of course it does. I’m one—”\n“I have spent my entire life living in a fog,” the parshman yelled at him.\n“Every day knowing I should say something, do something to stop this!\nEvery night clutching my daughter, wondering why the world seems to\nmove around us in the light—while we are trapped in shadows. They sold\nher mother. Sold her. Because she had birthed a healthy child, which made\nher good breeding stock.\n“Do you understand that, human? Do you understand watching your\nfamily be torn apart, and knowing you should object—knowing deep in\nyour soul that something is profoundly wrong? Can you know that feeling\nof being unable to say a single storming word to stop it?”\nThe parshman pulled him even closer. “They may have taken your\nfreedom, but they took our minds.”\nHe dropped Kaladin and whirled, gathering up his daughter and holding\nher close as he jogged to catch up to the others, who had turned back at the\noutburst. Kaladin followed, yanked by his rope, stepping on the little girl’s\nflower in his forced haste. Syl zipped past, and when Kaladin tried to catch\nher attention, she just laughed and flew higher on a burst of wind.\nHis captor suffered several quiet chastisements when they caught up; this\ncolumn couldn’t afford to draw attention. Kaladin walked with them, and\nremembered. He did understand a little.\nYou were never free while you ran; you felt as if the open sky and the\nendless fields were a torment. You could feel the pursuit following, and\neach morning you awoke expecting to find yourself surrounded.\nUntil one day you were right.\nBut parshmen? He’d accepted Shen into Bridge Four, yes. But accepting\nthat a sole parshman could be a bridgeman was starkly different from\naccepting the entire people as … well, human.\nAs the column stopped to distribute waterskins to the children, Kaladin\nfelt at his forehead, tracing the scarred shape of the glyphs there.\nThey took our minds.…\nThey’d tried to take his mind too. They’d beaten him to the stones, stolen\neverything he loved, and murdered his brother. Left him unable to think\nstraight. Life had become a blur until one day he’d found himself standing\nover a ledge, watching raindrops die and struggling to summon the\nmotivation to end his life.\nSyl soared past in the shape of a shimmering ribbon.\n“Syl,” Kaladin hissed. “I need to talk to you. This isn’t the time for—”\n“Hush,” she said, then giggled and zipped around him before flitting\nover and doing the same to his captor.\nKaladin frowned. She was acting so carefree. Too carefree? Like she’d\nbeen back before they forged their bond?\nNo. It couldn’t be.\n“Syl?” he begged as she returned. “Is something wrong with the bond?\nPlease, I didn’t—”"

Some, at least. And that other spren is still here\ntoo. A higher spren, like me.”\n“Where?” Kaladin asked, twisting.\n“She’s invisible to you,” Syl said, becoming a group of leaves and\nblowing around him. “I think I’ve fooled her into thinking I’m just a\nwindspren.”\nShe zipped away, leaving a dozen unanswered questions on Kaladin’s\nlips. Storms … is that spren how they know where to go?\nThe column started again, and Kaladin walked for a good hour in silence\nbefore Syl next decided to come back to him. She landed on his shoulder,\nbecoming the image of a young woman in her whimsical skirt. “She’s gone\nahead for a little bit,” she said. “And the parshmen aren’t looking.”\n“The spren is guiding them,” Kaladin said under his breath. “Syl, this\nspren must be…”\n“From him,” she whispered, wrapping her arms around herself and\ngrowing small—actively shrinking to about two-thirds her normal size.\n“Voidspren.”\n“There’s more,” Kaladin said. “These parshmen … how do they know\nhow to talk, how to act? Yes, they’ve spent their lives around society—but\nto be this, well, normal after such a long time half asleep?”\n“The Everstorm,” Syl said. “Power has filled the holes in their souls,\nbridging the gaps. They didn’t just wake, Kaladin. They’ve been healed,\nConnection refounded, Identity restored. There’s more to this than we ever\nrealized. Somehow when you conquered them, you stole their ability to\nchange forms. You literally ripped off a piece of their souls and locked it\naway.” She turned sharply. “She’s coming back. I will stay nearby, in case\nyou need a Blade.”\nShe left, zipping straight into the air as a ribbon of light. Kaladin\ncontinued to shuffle behind the column, chewing on her words, before\nspeeding up and stepping beside his captor.\n“You’re being smart, in some ways,” Kaladin said. “It’s good to travel at\nnight. But you’re following the riverbed over there. I know it makes for\nmore trees, and more secure camping, but this is literally the first place\nsomeone would look for you.”\nSeveral of the other parshmen gave him glances from nearby. His captor\ndidn’t say anything.\n“The big group is an issue too,” Kaladin added. “You should break into\nsmaller groups and meet up each morning, so if you get spotted you’ll seem\nless threatening. You can say you were sent somewhere by a lighteyes, and\ntravelers might let you go. If they run across all seventy of you together,\nthere’s no chance of that. This is all assuming, of course, you don’t want to\nfight—which you don’t. If you fight, they’ll call out the highlords against\nyou. For now they’ve got bigger problems.”\nHis captor grunted."

Why had the Everstorm not granted these parshmen\npowers like those on the Shattered Plains? What of the stories of scripture\nand lore? The Desolations?\nThey eventually stopped for another break, and Kaladin found himself a\nsmooth rock to sit against, nestled into the stone. His captor tied the rope to\na nearby lonely tree, then went to confer with the others. Kaladin leaned\nback, lost in thought until he heard a sound. He was surprised to find his\ncaptor’s daughter approaching. She carried a waterskin in two hands, and\nstopped right beyond his reach.\nShe didn’t have shoes, and the walk so far had not been kind to her feet,\nwhich—though tough with calluses—were still scored by scratches and\nscrapes. She timidly set the waterskin down, then backed away. She didn’t\nflee, as Kaladin might have expected, when he reached for the water.\n“Thank you,” he said, then took a mouthful. It was pure and clear—\napparently the parshmen knew how to settle and scoop their water. He\nignored the rumbling of his stomach.\n“Will they really chase us?” the girl asked.\nBy Mishim’s pale green light, he decided this girl was not as timid as he\nhad assumed. She was nervous, but she met his eyes with hers.\n“Why can’t they just let us go?” she asked. “Could you go back and tell\nthem? We don’t want trouble. We just want to go away.”\n“They’ll come,” Kaladin said. “I’m sorry. They have a lot of work to do\nin rebuilding, and they’ll want the extra hands. You are a … resource they\ncan’t simply ignore.”\nThe humans he’d visited hadn’t known to expect some terrible\nVoidbringer force; many thought their parshmen had merely run off in the\nchaos.\n“But why?” she said, sniffling. “What did we do to them?”\n“You tried to destroy them.”\n“No. We’re nice. We’ve always been nice. I never hit anyone, even when\nI was mad.”\n“I didn’t mean you specifically,” Kaladin said. “Your ancestors—the\npeople like you from long ago. There was a war, and…”\nStorms. How did you explain slavery to a seven-year-old? He tossed the\nwaterskin to her, and she scampered back to her father—who had only just\nnoticed her absence. He stood, a stark silhouette in the night, studying\nKaladin.\n“They’re talking about making camp,” Syl whispered from nearby. She\nhad crawled into a crack in the rock. “The Voidspren wants them to march\non through the day, but I don’t think they’re going to. They’re worried\nabout their grain spoiling.”"

That would change his eye color, but in the\ndarkness, he hoped the parshmen wouldn’t notice.\nSyl puffed back into a spren. “Sword now?” she said. “The spheres they\ntook from you have all run out, but they’ll scatter at seeing a Blade.”\n“No.” Kaladin instead picked up a large stone. The parshmen hushed,\nnoticing his escape. Kaladin carried his rock a few steps, then dropped it,\ncrushing a rockbud. He was surrounded a few moments later by angry\nparshmen carrying cudgels.\nKaladin ignored them, picking through the wreckage of the rockbud. He\nheld up a large section of shell.\n“The inside of this,” he said, turning it over for them, “will still be dry,\ndespite the rainfall. The rockbud needs a barrier between itself and the\nwater outside for some reason, though it always seems eager to drink after a\nstorm. Who has my knife?”\nNobody moved to return it.\n“If you scrape off this inner layer,” Kaladin said, tapping at the rockbud\nshell, “you can get to the dry portion. Now that the rain has stopped, I\nshould be able to get us a fire going, assuming nobody has lost my tinder\nbag. We need to boil that grain, then dry it into cakes. They won’t be tasty,\nbut they’ll keep. If you don’t do something soon, your supplies will rot.”\nHe stood up and pointed. “Since we’re already here, we should be near\nenough the river that we can gather more water. It won’t flow much longer\nwith the end of the rains.\n“Rockbud shells don’t burn particularly well, so we’ll want to harvest\nsome real wood and dry it at the fire during the day. We can keep that one\nsmall, then do the cooking tomorrow night. In the dark, the smoke is less\nlikely to reveal us, and we can shield the light in the trees. I just have to\nfigure out how we’re going to cook without any pots to boil the water.”\nThe parshmen stared at him. Then Khen finally pushed him away from\nthe rockbud and took up the shard he’d been holding. Kaladin spotted his\noriginal captor standing near the rock where Kaladin had been sitting. The\nparshman held the rope Kaladin had cut, rubbing its sliced-through end with\nhis thumb.\nAfter a short conference, the parshmen dragged him to the trees he’d\nindicated, returned his knife—standing by with every cudgel they had—and\ndemanded that he prove he could build a fire with wet wood.\nHe did just that.\n18.

        "text": "You cannot have a spice described to you, but must taste it for yourself.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nShallan became Veil.\nStormlight made her face less youthful, more angular. Nose pointed,\nwith a small scar on the chin. Her hair rippled from red to Alethi black.\nMaking an illusion like this took a larger gem of Stormlight, but once it was\ngoing, she could maintain it for hours on just a smidgen.\nVeil tossed aside the havah, instead pulling on trousers and a tight shirt,\nthen boots and a long white coat. She finished with only a simple glove on\nthe left hand. Veil, of course, wasn’t in the least embarrassed at that.\nThere was a simple relief for Shallan’s pain. There was an easy way to\nhide. Veil hadn’t suffered as Shallan had—and she was tough enough to\nhandle that sort of thing anyway. Becoming her was like setting down a\nterrible burden.\nVeil threw a scarf around her neck, then slung a rugged satchel—\nacquired for Veil specifically—over her shoulder. Hopefully the\nconspicuous knife handle sticking out from the top would look natural, even\nintimidating.\nThe part at the back of her mind that was still Shallan worried about this.\nWould she look fake? She’d almost certainly missed some subtle clues\nencoded in her behavior, dress, or speech. These would indicate to the right\npeople that Veil didn’t have the hard-bitten experience she feigned.\nWell, she would have to do her best and hope to recover from her\ninevitable mistakes. She tied another knife onto her belt, long, but not quite\na sword, since Veil wasn’t lighteyed. Fortunately. No lighteyed woman\nwould be able to prance around so obviously armed. Some mores grew lax\nthe farther you descended the social ladder.\n“Well?” Veil asked, turning to the wall, where Pattern hung.\n“Mmm…” he said. “Good lie.”\n“Thank you.”\n“Not like the other.”\n“Radiant?”\n“You slip in and out of her,” Pattern said, “like the sun behind clouds.”\n“I just need more practice,” Veil said. Yes, that voice sounded excellent.\nShallan was getting far better with sounds.\nShe picked Pattern up—which involved pressing her hand against the\nwall, letting him pass over to her skin and then her coat. With him humming\nhappily, she crossed her room and stepped out onto the balcony. The first\nmoon had risen, violet and proud Salas. She was the least bright of the\nmoons, which meant it was mostly dark out.\nMost rooms on the outside had these small balconies, but hers on the\nsecond level was particularly advantageous. It had steps down to the field\nbelow. Covered in furrows for water and ridges for planting rockbuds, the\nfield also had boxes at the edges for growing tubers or ornamental plants.\nEach tier of the city had a similar one, with eighteen levels inside separating\nthem.\nShe stepped down to the field in the darkness. How had anything ever\ngrown up here? Her breath puffed out in front of her, and coldspren grew\naround her feet.\nThe field had a small access doorway back into Urithiru. Perhaps the\nsubterfuge of not exiting through her room wasn’t necessary, but Veil"

Perhaps the\nsubterfuge of not exiting through her room wasn’t necessary, but Veil\npreferred to be careful. She wouldn’t want guards or servants remarking on\nhow Brightness Shallan went about during odd hours of the night.\nBesides, who knew where Mraize and his Ghostbloods had operatives?\nThey hadn’t contacted her since that first day in Urithiru, but she knew\nthey’d be watching. She still didn’t know what to do about them. They had\nadmitted to assassinating Jasnah, which should be grounds enough to hate\nthem. They also seemed to know things, important things, about the world.\nVeil strolled through the corridor, carrying a small hand lamp for light, as\na sphere would make her stand out. She passed evening crowds that kept the\ncorridors of Sebarial’s quarter as busy as his warcamp had been. Things\nnever seemed to slow down here as much as they did in Dalinar’s quarter.\nThe strangely mesmerizing strata of the corridors guided her out of\nSebarial’s quarter. The number of people in the hallways slackened. Just\nVeil and those lonely, endless tunnels. She felt as if she could sense the\nweight of the other levels of the tower, empty and unexplored, bearing\ndown on her. A mountain of unknown stone.\nShe hurried on her way, Pattern humming to himself from her coat.\n“I like him,” Pattern said.\n“Who?” Veil said.\n“The swordsman,” Pattern said. “Mmm. The one you can’t mate with\nyet.”\n“Can we please stop talking about him that way?”\n“Very well,” Pattern said. “But I like him.”\n“You hate his sword.”\n“I have come to understand,” Pattern said, growing excited. “Humans …\nhumans don’t care about the dead. You build chairs and doors out of\ncorpses! You eat corpses! You make clothing from the skins of corpses.\nCorpses are things to you.”\n“Well, I guess that’s true.” He seemed unnaturally excited by the\nrevelation.\n“It is grotesque,” he continued, “but you all must kill and destroy to live.\nIt is the way of the Physical Realm. So I should not hate Adolin Kholin for\nwielding a corpse!”\n“You just like him,” Veil said, “because he tells Radiant to respect the\nsword.”\n“Mmm. Yes, very, very nice man. Wonderfully smart too.”\n“Why don’t you marry him, then?”\nPattern buzzed. “Is that—”\n“No that’s not an option.”\n“Oh.” He settled down into a contented buzz on her coat, where he\nappeared as a strange kind of embroidery.\nAfter a short time walking, Shallan found she needed to say something\nmore. “Pattern. Do you remember what you said to me the other night, the\nfirst time … we became Radiant?”\n“About dying?” Pattern asked. “It may be the only way, Shallan.\nMmm … You must speak truths to progress, but you will hate me for\nmaking it happen. So I can die, and once done you can—”\n“No. No, please don’t leave me.”\n“But you hate me.”"

Don’t\ndie.”\nPattern seemed pleased by this, as his humming increased—though his\nsounds of pleasure and his sounds of agitation could be similar. For the\nmoment, Veil let herself be distracted by the night’s quest. Adolin continued\nhis efforts to find the murderer, but hadn’t gotten far. Aladar was Highprince\nof Information, and his policing force and scribes were a resource—but\nAdolin wanted badly to do as his father asked.\nVeil thought that perhaps both were looking in the wrong places. She\nfinally saw lights ahead and quickened her pace, eventually stepping out\nonto a walkway around a large cavernous room that stretched up several\nstories. She had reached the Breakaway: a vast collection of tents lit by\nmany flickering candles, torches, or lanterns.\nThe market had sprung up shockingly fast, in defiance of Navani’s\ncarefully outlined plans. Her idea had been for a grand thoroughfare with\nshops along the sides. No alleyways, no shanties or tents. Easily patrolled\nand carefully regulated.\nThe merchants had rebelled, complaining about lack of storage space, or\nthe need to be closer to a well for fresh water. In reality, they wanted a\nlarger market that was much harder to regulate. Sebarial, as Highprince of\nCommerce, had agreed. And despite having made a mess of his ledgers, he\nwas sharp when it came to trade.\nThe chaos and variety of it excited Veil. Hundreds of people, despite the\nhour, attracting spren of a dozen varieties. Dozens upon dozens of tents of\nvaried colors and designs. In fact, some weren’t tents at all, but were better\ndescribed as stands—roped-off sections of ground guarded by a few burly\nmen with cudgels. Others were actual buildings. Small stone sheds that had\nbeen built inside this cavern, here since the days of the Radiants.\nMerchants from all ten original warcamps mixed at the Breakaway. She\npassed three different cobblers in a row; Veil had never understood why\nmerchants selling the same things congregated. Wouldn’t it be better to set\nup where you wouldn’t have competition literally next door?\nShe packed away her hand lamp, as there was plenty of light here from\nthe merchant tents and shops, and sauntered along. Veil felt more\ncomfortable than she had in those empty, twisted corridors; here, life had\ngained a foothold. The market grew like the snarl of wildlife and plants on\nthe leeward side of a ridge.\nShe made her way to the cavern’s central well: a large, round enigma\nthat rippled with crem-free water. She’d never seen an actual well before—\neveryone normally used cisterns that refilled with the storms. The many\nwells in Urithiru, however, never ran out. The water level didn’t even drop,\ndespite people constantly drawing from them.\nScribes talked about the possibility of a hidden aquifer in the mountains,\nbut where would the water come from? Snows at the tops of the peaks\nnearby didn’t seem to melt, and rain fell very rarely."

Snows at the tops of the peaks\nnearby didn’t seem to melt, and rain fell very rarely.\nVeil sat on the well’s side, one leg up, watching the people who came\nand went. She listened to the women chatter about the Voidbringers, about\nfamily back in Alethkar, and about the strange new storm. She listened to\nthe men worry about being pressed into the military, or about their darkeyed\nnahn being lowered, now that there weren’t parshmen to do common work.\nSome lighteyed workers complained about supplies trapped back in Narak,\nwaiting for Stormlight before they could be transferred here.\nVeil eventually ambled off toward a particular row of taverns. I can’t\ninterrogate too hard to get my answers, she thought. If I ask the wrong kind\nof questions, everyone will figure me for some kind of spy for Aladar’s\npolicing force.\nVeil. Veil didn’t hurt. She was comfortable, confident. She’d meet\npeople’s eyes. She’d lift her chin in challenge to anyone who seemed to be\nsizing her up. Power was an illusion of perception.\nVeil had her own kind of power, that of a lifetime spent on the streets\nknowing she could take care of herself. She had the stubbornness of a chull,\nand while she was cocky, that confidence was a power of its own. She got\nwhat she wanted and wasn’t embarrassed by success.\nThe first bar she chose was inside a large battle tent. It smelled of spilled\nlavis beer and sweaty bodies. Men and women laughed, using overturned\ncrates as tables and chairs. Most wore simple darkeyed clothing: laced shirts\n—no money or time for buttons—and trousers or skirts. A few men dressed\nafter an older fashion, with a wrap and a loose filmy vest that left the chest\nexposed.\nThis was a low-end tavern, and likely wouldn’t work for her needs.\nShe’d need a place that was lower, yet somehow richer. More disreputable,\nbut with access to the powerful members of the warcamp undergrounds.\nStill, this seemed a good place to practice. The bar was made of stacked\nboxes and had some actual chairs beside it. Veil leaned against the “bar” in\nwhat she hoped was a smooth way, and nearly knocked the boxes over. She\nstumbled, catching them, then smiled sheepishly at the bartender—an old\ndarkeyed woman with grey hair.\n“What do you want?” the woman asked.\n“Wine,” Veil said. “Sapphire.” The second most intoxicating. Let them\nsee that Veil could handle the hard stuff.\n“We got Vari, kimik, and a nice barrel of Veden. That one will cost you\nthough.”\n“Uh…” Adolin would have known the differences. “Give me the Veden.”\nSeemed appropriate.\nThe woman made her pay first, with dun spheres, but the cost didn’t\nseem outrageous. Sebarial wanted the liquor flowing—his suggested way to\nmake sure tensions didn’t get too high in the tower—and had subsidized the\nprices with low taxes, for now.\nWhile the woman worked behind her improvised bar, Veil suffered\nbeneath the gaze of one of the bouncers.

Those didn’t stay near the\nentrance, but instead waited here, beside the liquor and the money. Despite\nwhat Aladar’s policing force would like, this place was not completely safe.\nIf unexplained murders had been glossed over or forgotten, they would\nhave happened in the Breakaway, where the clutter, worry, and press of tens\nof thousands of camp followers balanced on the edge of lawlessness.\nThe barkeep plunked a cup in front of Veil—a tiny cup, with a clear\nliquid in it.\nVeil scowled, holding it up. “You got mine wrong, barkeep; I ordered\nsapphire. What is this, water?”\nThe bouncer nearest Veil snickered, and the barkeep stopped in place,\nthen looked her over. Apparently Shallan had already made one of those\nmistakes she’d been worried about.\n“Kid,” the barkeep said, somehow leaning on the boxes near her and not\nknocking any over. “That’s the same stuff, just without the fancy infusions\nthe lighteyes put in theirs.”\nInfusions?\n“You some kind of house servant?” the woman asked softly. “Out for\nyour first night on your own?”\n“Of course not,” Veil said. “I’ve done this a hundred times.”\n“Sure, sure,” the woman replied, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her\near. It popped right back up. “You certain you want that? I might have some\nwines back here done with lighteyed colors, for you. In fact, I know I’ve got\na nice orange.” She reached to reclaim the cup.\nVeil seized it and knocked the entire thing back in a single gulp. That\nproved to be one of the worst mistakes of her life. The liquid burned, like it\nwas on fire! She felt her eyes go wide, and she started coughing and almost\nthrew up right there on the bar.\nThat was wine? Tasted more like lye. What was wrong with these\npeople? There was no sweetness to it at all, not even a hint of flavor. Just\nthat burning sensation, like someone was scraping her throat with a\nscouring brush! Her face immediately grew warm. It hit her so fast!\nThe bouncer was holding his face, trying—and failing—not to laugh out\nloud. The barkeep patted Shallan on the back as she kept coughing. “Here,”\nthe woman said, “let me get you something to chase that—”\n“No,” Shallan croaked. “I’m just happy to be able to drink this … again\nafter so long. Another. Please.”\nThe barkeep seemed skeptical, though the bouncer was all for it—he’d\nsettled down on the stool to watch Shallan, grinning. Shallan placed a\nsphere on the bar, defiant, and the barkeep reluctantly filled her cup again.\nBy now, three or four other people from nearby seats had turned to\nwatch. Lovely. Shallan braced herself, then drank the wine in a long,\nextended gulp.\nIt wasn’t any better the second time. She held for a moment, eyes\nwatering, then let out an explosion of coughing.

She ended up hunched\nover, shaking, eyes squeezed closed. She was pretty sure she let out a long\nsqueak as well.\nSeveral people in the tent clapped. Shallan looked back at the amused\nbarkeep, her eyes watering. “That was awful,” she said, then coughed. “You\nreally drink this dreadful liquid?”\n“Oh, hon,” the woman said. “That’s not nearly as bad as they get.”\nShallan groaned. “Well, get me another.”\n“You sure—”\n“Yes,” Shallan said with a sigh. She probably wasn’t going to be\nestablishing a reputation for herself tonight—at least not the type she\nwanted. But she could try to accustom herself to drinking this cleaning\nfluid.\nStorms. She was already feeling lighter. Her stomach did not like what\nshe was doing to it, and she shoved down a bout of nausea.\nStill chuckling, the bouncer moved a seat closer to her. He was a\nyounger man, with hair cut so short it stood up on end. He was as Alethi as\nthey came, with a deep tan skin and a dusting of black scrub on his chin.\n“You should try sipping it,” he said to her. “Goes down easier in sips.”\n“Great. That way I can savor the terrible flavor. So bitter! Wine is\nsupposed to be sweet.”\n“Depends on how you make it,” he said as the barkeep gave Shallan\nanother cup. “Sapphire can sometimes be distilled tallew, no natural fruit in\nit—just some coloring for accent. But they don’t serve the really hard stuff\nat lighteyed parties, except to people who know how to ask for it.”\n“You know your alcohol,” Veil said. The room shook for a moment\nbefore settling. Then she tried another drink—a sip this time.\n“It comes with the job,” he said with a broad smile. “I work a lot of\nfancy events for the lighteyes, so I know my way around a place with\ntablecloths instead of boxes.”\nVeil grunted. “They need bouncers at fancy lighteyed events?”\n“Sure,” he said, cracking his knuckles. “You just have to know how to\n‘escort’ someone out of the feast hall, instead of throwing them out. It’s\nactually easier.” He cocked his head. “But strangely, more dangerous at the\nsame time.” He laughed.\nKelek, Veil realized as he scooted closer. He’s flirting with me.\nShe probably shouldn’t have found it so surprising. She’d come in alone,\nand while Shallan would never have described Veil as “cute,” she wasn’t\nugly. She was kind of normal, if rugged, but she dressed well and obviously\nhad money. Her face and hands were clean, her clothing—while not rich\nsilks—a generous step up from worker garb.\nInitially she was offended by his attention. Here she’d gone to all this\ntrouble to make herself capable and hard as rocks, and the first thing she did\nwas attract some guy? One who cracked his knuckles and tried to tell her\nhow to drink her alcohol?\nJust to spite him, she downed the rest of her cup in a single shot."

One who cracked his knuckles and tried to tell her\nhow to drink her alcohol?\nJust to spite him, she downed the rest of her cup in a single shot.\nShe immediately felt guilty for her annoyance at the man. Shouldn’t she\nbe flattered? Granted, Adolin could have destroyed this man in any\nconceivable way. Adolin even cracked his knuckles louder.\n“So…” the bouncer said. “Which warcamp you from?”\n“Sebarial,” Veil said.\nThe bouncer nodded, as if he’d expected that. Sebarial’s camp had been\nthe most eclectic. They chatted a little longer, mostly with Shallan making\nthe odd comment while the bouncer—his name was Jor—went off on\nvarious stories with many tangents. Always smiling, often boasting.\nHe wasn’t too bad, though he didn’t seem to care what she actually said,\nso long as it prompted him to keep talking. She drank some more of the\nterrible liquid, but found her mind wandering.\nThese people … they each had lives, families, loves, dreams. Some\nslumped at their boxes, lonely, while others laughed with friends. Some\nkept their clothing, poor though it was, reasonably clean—others were\nstained with crem and lavis ale. Several of them reminded her of Tyn, the\nway they talked with confidence, the way their interactions were a subtle\ngame of one-upping each other.\nJor paused, as if expecting something from her. What … what had he\nbeen saying? Following him was getting harder, as her mind drifted.\n“Go on,” she said.\nHe smiled, and launched into another story.\nI’m not going to be able to imitate this, she thought, leaning against her\nbox, until I’ve lived it. No more than I could draw their lives without having\nwalked among them.\nThe barkeep came back with the bottle, and Shallan nodded. That last\ncup hadn’t burned nearly as much as the others.\n“You … sure you want more?” the bouncer asked.\nStorms … she was starting to feel really sick. She’d had four cups, yes,\nbut they were little cups. She blinked, and turned.\nThe room spun in a blur, and she groaned, resting her head on the table.\nBeside her, the bouncer sighed.\n“I could have told you that you were wasting your time, Jor,” the\nbarkeep said. “This one will be out before the hour is done. Wonder what\nshe’s trying to forget…”\n“She’s just enjoying a little free time,” Jor said.\n“Sure, sure. With eyes like those? I’m sure that’s it.” The barkeep moved\naway.\n“Hey,” Jor said, nudging Shallan. “Where are you staying? I’ll call you a\npalanquin to cart you home. You awake? You should get going before things\ngo too late. I know some porters who can be trusted.”\n“It’s … not even late yet…” Shallan mumbled.\n“Late enough,” Jor said. “This place can get dangerous.”\n“Yeaaah?” Shallan asked, a glimmer of memory waking inside of her.\n“People get stabbed?”\n“Unfortunately,” Jor said.\n“You know of some…?”\n“Never happens here in this area, at least not yet.”"

They found him dead.”\n“Real … real strange, eh?” Shallan asked.\n“Yeah. You heard?” Jor shivered.\nShallan stood up to go, but the room upended about her, and she found\nherself slipping down beside her stool. Jor tried to catch her, but she hit the\nground with a thump, knocking her elbow against the stone floor. She\nimmediately sucked in a little Stormlight to help with the pain.\nThe cloud around her mind puffed away, and her vision stopped\nspinning. In a striking moment, her drunkenness simply vanished.\nShe blinked. Wow. She stood up without Jor’s help, dusting off her coat\nand then pulling her hair back away from her face. “Thanks,” she said, “but\nthat’s exactly the information I need. Barkeep, we settled?”\nThe woman turned, then froze, staring at Shallan, pouring liquid into a\ncup until it overflowed.\nShallan picked up her cup, then turned it and shook the last drop into her\nmouth. “That’s good stuff,” she noted. “Thanks for the conversation, Jor.”\nShe set a sphere on the boxes as a tip, pulled on her hat, then patted Jor\nfondly on the cheek before striding out of the tent.\n“Stormfather!” Jor said from behind her. “Did I just get played for a\nfool?”\nIt was still busy out, reminding her of Kharbranth, with its midnight\nmarkets. That made sense. Neither sun nor moon could penetrate to these\nhalls; it was easy to lose track of time. Beyond that, while most people had\nbeen put immediately to work, many of the soldiers had free time without\nplateau runs to do any longer.\nShallan asked around, and managed to get pointed toward All’s Alley.\n“The Stormlight made me sober,” she said to Pattern, who had crawled up\nher coat and now dimpled her collar, folded over the top.\n“Healed you of poison.”\n“That will be useful.”\n“Mmmm. I thought you’d be angry. You drank the poison on purpose,\ndidn’t you?”\n“Yes, but the point wasn’t to get drunk.”\nHe buzzed in confusion. “Then why drink it?”\n“It’s complicated,” Shallan said. She sighed. “I didn’t do a very good job\nin there.”\n“Of getting drunk? Mmm. You gave it a good effort.”\n“As soon as I got drunk, as soon as I lost control, Veil slipped away from\nme.”\n“Veil is just a face.”\nNo. Veil was a woman who didn’t giggle when she got drunk, or whine,\nfanning her mouth when the drink was too hard for her. She never acted like\na silly teenager. Veil hadn’t been sheltered, practically locked away, until\nshe went crazy and murdered her own family.\nShallan stopped in place, suddenly frantic. “My brothers.

A strange name for a tavern, but\nshe had seen stranger. It wasn’t an alley at all, but a big set of five tents\nsewn together, each a different color. It glowed dimly from within.\nA bouncer stood out front, short and squat, with a scar running up his\ncheek, across his forehead, and onto his scalp. He gave Veil a critical\nlooking-over, but didn’t stop her as she sauntered—full of confidence—into\nthe tent. It smelled worse than the other pub, with all these drunken people\ncrammed together. The tents had been sewn to create partitioned-off areas,\ndarkened nooks—and a few had tables and chairs instead of boxes. The\npeople who sat at them didn’t wear the simple clothing of workers, but\ninstead leathers, rags, or unbuttoned military coats.\nBoth richer than the other tavern, Veil thought, and lower at the same\ntime.\nShe rambled through the room, which—despite oil lamps on some tables\n—was quite dim. The “bar” was a plank set across some boxes, but they’d\ndraped a cloth over the middle. A few people waited for drinks; Veil ignored\nthem. “What’s the strongest thing you’ve got?” she asked the barkeep, a fat\nman in a takama. She thought he might be lighteyed. It was too dim to tell\nfor certain.\nHe looked her over. “Veden saph, single barrel.”\n“Right,” Veil said dryly. “If I wanted water, I’d go to the well. Surely\nyou’ve got something stronger.”\nThe barkeep grunted, then reached behind himself and took out a jug of\nsomething clear, with no label. “Horneater white,” he said, thumping it\ndown on the table. “I have no idea what they ferment to make the stuff, but\nit takes paint off real nicely.”\n“Perfect,” Veil said, clacking a few spheres onto the improvised counter.\nThe others in line had been shooting her glares for ignoring the line, but at\nthis their expressions turned to amusement."

She downed it in one gulp. Shallan trembled inside at the burning that\nfollowed—the immediate warmth to her cheeks and almost instant sense of\nnausea, accompanied by a tremor through her muscles as she tried to resist\nthrowing up.\nVeil was expecting all this. She held her breath to stifle the nausea, and\nrelished the sensations. No worse than the pains already inside, she thought,\nwarmth radiating through her.\n“Great,” she said. “Leave the jug.”\nThose idiots beside the bar continued to gawk as she poured another cup\nof the Horneater white and downed it, feeling its warmth. She turned to\ninspect the tent’s occupants. Who to approach first? Aladar’s scribes had\nchecked watch records for anyone else killed the same way as Sadeas, and\nthey’d come up empty—but a killing in an alleyway might not get reported.\nShe hoped that the people here would know of it regardless.\nShe poured some more of that Horneater drink. Though it was even\nfouler-tasting than the Veden saph, she found something strangely appealing\nabout it. She downed the third cup, but drew in a tiny bit of Stormlight from\na sphere in her pouch—just a smidge that instantly burned away and didn’t\nmake her glow—to heal herself.\n“What are you looking at?” she said, eyeing the people in line at the bar.\nThey turned away as the bartender moved to put a stopper on the jug.\nVeil put her hand on top of it. “I’m not done with that yet.”\n“You are,” the bartender said, brushing her hand away. “One of two\nthings is going to happen if you continue like that. You’ll either puke all\nover my bar, or you’ll drop dead. You’re not a Horneater; this will kill you.”\n“That’s my problem.”\n“The mess is mine,” the barkeep said, yanking the jug back. “I’ve seen\nyour type, with that haunted look. You’ll get yourself drunk, then pick a\nfight. I don’t care what it is you want to forget; go find some other place to\ndo it.”\nVeil cocked an eyebrow. Getting kicked out of the most disreputable bar\nin the market? Well, at least her reputation wouldn’t suffer here.\nShe caught the barkeep’s arm as he pulled it back. “I’m not here to tear\nyour bar down, friend,” she said softly. “I’m here about a murder. Someone\nwho was killed here a few days back.”\nThe barkeep froze. “Who are you? You with the guard?”\n“Damnation, no!” Veil said. Story. I need a cover story. “I’m hunting the\nman who killed my little sister.”\n“And that has to do with my bar how?”\n“I’ve heard rumors of a body found near here.”\n“A grown woman,” the barkeep said. “So not your sister.”\n“My sister didn’t die here,” Veil said. “She died back in the warcamps;"

I’m not going to make trouble. I just need\ninformation. I hear there were … unusual circumstances about this death.\nThis rumored death. The man who killed my sister, he has something\nstrange about him. He kills in the same way every time. Please.”\nThe barkeep met her eyes. Let him see, Veil thought. Let him see a\nwoman with a hard edge, but wounds inside. A story reflected in her eyes—\na narrative she needed this man to believe.\n“The one who did it,” the barkeep said softly, “has already been dealt\nwith.”\n“I need to know if your murderer is the same one I’ve been hunting,”\nVeil said. “I need details of the killing, however gruesome they may be.”\n“I can’t say anything,” the barkeep whispered, but he nodded toward one\nof the alcoves made from the stitched-together tents, where shadows\nindicated some people were drinking. “They might.”\n“Who are they?”\n“Just your everyday, ordinary thugs,” the barkeep said. “But they’re the\nones I pay to keep my bar out of trouble. If someone had disturbed this\nestablishment in a way that risked the authorities shutting the place down—\nas that Aladar is so fond of doing—those are the people who would have\ntaken care of said problem. I won’t say more.”\nVeil nodded in thanks, but didn’t let go of his arm. She tapped her cup\nand cocked her head hopefully. The barkeep sighed and gave her one more\nhit of the Horneater white, which she paid for, then sipped as she walked\naway.\nThe alcove he’d indicated held a single table full of a variety of ruffians.\nThe men wore the clothing of the Alethi upper crust: jackets and stiff\nuniform-style trousers, belts and buttoned shirts. Here, their jackets were\nundone, their shirts loose. Two of the women even wore the havah, though\nanother was in trousers and a jacket, not too different from what Veil wore.\nThe whole group reminded her of Tyn in the way they lounged in an almost\ndeliberate way. It took effort to look so indifferent.\nThere was an unoccupied seat, so Veil strolled right in and took it. The\nlighteyed woman across from her hushed a jabbering man by touching his\nlips. She wore the havah, but without a safehand sleeve—instead, she wore\na glove with the fingers brazenly cut off at the knuckles.\n“That’s Ur’s seat,” the woman said to Veil. “When he gets back from the\npisser, you’d best have moved on.”\n“Then I’ll be quick,” Veil said, downing the rest of her drink, savoring\nthe warmth. “A woman was found dead here. I think the murderer might\nhave also killed someone dear to me. I’ve been told the murderer was ‘dealt\nwith,’ but I need to know for myself.”"

I’ve been told the murderer was ‘dealt\nwith,’ but I need to know for myself.”\n“Hey,” said a foppish man wearing a blue jacket, with slits in the outer\nlayer to show yellow underneath. “You’re the one that was drinking the\nHorneater white. Old Sullik only keeps that jug as a joke.”\nThe woman in the havah laced her fingers before herself, inspecting Veil.\n“Look,” Veil said, “just tell me what the information will cost me.”\n“One can’t buy,” the woman said, “what isn’t for sale.”\n“Everything is for sale,” Veil said, “if you ask the right way.”\n“Which you’re not doing.”\n“Look,” Veil said, trying to catch the woman’s eyes. “Listen. My kid\nsister, she—”\nA hand fell on Shallan’s shoulder, and she looked up to find an enormous\nHorneater man standing behind her. Storms, he had to be nearly seven feet\ntall.\n“This,” he said, drawing out the i sound to an e instead, “is my spot.”\nHe pulled Veil off the chair, tossing her backward to roll on the ground,\nher cup tumbling away, her satchel twisting and getting wound up in her\narms. She came to a rest, blinking as the large man sat on the chair. She felt\nshe could hear its soul groaning in protest.\nVeil growled, then stood up. She yanked off her satchel and dropped it,\nthen removed a handkerchief and the knife from inside. This knife was\nnarrow and pointed, long but thinner than the one on her belt.\nShe picked up her hat and dusted it off before replacing it and strolling\nback up to the table. Shallan disliked confrontation, but Veil loved it.\n“Well, well,” she said, resting her safehand on the top of the large\nHorneater’s left hand, which was lying flat on the tabletop. She leaned\ndown beside him. “You say it’s your place, but I don’t see it marked with\nyour name.”\nThe Horneater stared at her, confused by the strangely intimate gesture\nof putting her safehand on his hand.\n“Let me show you,” she said, removing her knife and placing the point\nonto the back of her hand, which was pressed against his.\n“What is this?” he asked, sounding amused. “You put on an act, being\ntough? I have seen men pretend—”\nVeil rammed the knife down through her hand, through his, and into the\ntabletop. The Horneater screamed, whipping his hand upward, making Veil\npull the knife out of both hands. The man toppled out of his chair as he\nscrambled away from her.\nVeil settled down in it again. She took the cloth from her pocket and\nwrapped it around her bleeding hand. That would obscure the cut when she\nhealed it.\nWhich she didn’t do at first. It would need to be seen bleeding. Instead—\na part of her surprised at how calm she remained—she retrieved her knife,\nwhich had fallen beside the table.\n“You’re crazy!” the Horneater said, recovering his feet, holding his"

Ur’s seat. I was wrong.” She frowned. “But mine’s\nhere too. Suppose you can sit in my lap, if you want.”\n“I’ll throttle you!” Ur said, shooting a glare at the people in the main\nroom of the tent, who had crowded around the entrance to this smaller\nroom, whispering. “I’ll—”\n“Quiet, Ur,” the woman in the havah said.\nHe sputtered. “But Betha!”\n“You think,” the woman said to Veil, “assaulting my friends is going to\nmake me more likely to talk?”\n“Honestly, I just wanted the seat back.” Veil shrugged, scratching at the\ntabletop with her knife. “But if you want me to start hurting people, I\nsuppose I could do that.”\n“You really are crazy,” Betha said.\n“No. I just don’t consider your little group a threat.” She continued\nscratching. “I’ve tried being nice, and my patience is running thin. It’s time\nto tell me what I want to know before this turns ugly.”\nBetha frowned, then glanced at what Veil had scratched into the tabletop.\nThree interlocking diamonds.\nThe symbol of the Ghostbloods.\nVeil gambled that the woman would know what it meant. They seemed\nthe type who would—small-time thugs, yes, but ones with a presence in an\nimportant market. Veil wasn’t certain how secretive Mraize and his people\nwere with their symbol, but the fact that they got it tattooed on their bodies\nindicated to her that it wasn’t supposed to be terribly secret. More a\nwarning, like cremlings who displayed red claws to indicate they were\npoisonous.\nIndeed, the moment Betha saw the symbol, she gasped softly. “We … we\nwant nothing to do with your type,” Betha said. One of the men at the table\nstood up, trembling, and looked from side to side, as if expecting assassins\nto tackle him right then.\nWow, Veil thought. Even cutting the hand of one of their members hadn’t\nprovoked this strong a reaction.\nCuriously though, one of the other women at the table—a short, younger\nwoman wearing a havah—leaned forward, interested.\n“The murderer,” Veil said. “What happened to him?”\n“We had Ur drop him off the plateau outside,” Betha said. “But … how\ncould this be a man you would be interested in? It was just Ned.”\n“Ned?”\n“Drunk, from Sadeas’s camp,” said one of the men. “Angry drunk;\nalways got into trouble.”\n“Killed his wife,” Betha said. “Pity too, after she followed him all the\nway out here. Guess none of us had much choice, with that crazy storm. But\nstill…”\n“And this Ned,” Veil said, “murdered his wife with a knife through the\neye?”\n“What? No, he strangled her. Poor bastard.”"

So it was a dead end? “But I heard that the\nmurder was strange.”\n“No,” the standing man said, then settled back down beside Betha, knife\nout. He set it on the table, in front of them. “We knew Ned would go too far\nat some point. Everyone did. I don’t think any of us was surprised when,\nafter she tried to drag him away from the tavern that night, he finally went\nover the edge.”\nLiterally, Shallan thought. At least once Ur got hold of him.\n“It appears,” Veil said, standing up, “that I have wasted your time. I will\nleave spheres with the barkeep; your tab is my debt, tonight.” She spared a\nglance for Ur, who hunched nearby and regarded her with a sullen\nexpression. She waved her bloodied fingers at him, then made her way back\ntoward the main tent room of the tavern.\nShe hovered just inside it, contemplating her next move. Her hand\nthrobbed, but she ignored it. Dead end. Perhaps she’d been foolish to think\nshe could solve in a few hours what Adolin had spent weeks trying to crack.\n“Oh, don’t look so sullen, Ur,” Betha said from behind, voice drifting out\nof the tent alcove. “At least it was just your hand. Considering who that\nwas, it could have been a lot worse.”\n“But why was she so interested in Ned?” Ur said. “Is she going to come\nback because I killed him?”\n“She wasn’t after him,” one of the other women snapped. “Didn’t you\nlisten? Ain’t nobody that cares Ned killed poor Rem.” She paused. “Course,\nit could have been about the other woman he killed.”\nVeil felt a shock run through her. She spun, striding back into the alcove.\nUr whimpered, hunching down and holding his wounded hand.\n“There was another murder?” Veil demanded.\n“I…” Betha licked her lips. “I was going to tell you, but you left so fast\nthat—”\n“Just talk.”\n“We’d have let the watch take care of Ned, but he couldn’t leave it at\nkilling just poor Rem.”\n“He killed another person?”\nBetha nodded. “One of the barmaids here. That we couldn’t let pass. We\nprotect this place, you see. So Ur had to take a long walk with Ned.”\nThe man with the knife rubbed his chin. “Strangest thing, that he’d come\nback and kill a barmaid the next night. Left her body right around the corner\nfrom where he killed poor Rem.”\n“He screamed the whole time we were taking him to his fall that he\nhadn’t killed the second one,” Ur muttered.\n“He did,” Betha said. “That barmaid was strangled the exact same way\nas Rem, body dropped in the same position.

Even had the marks of his ring\nscraping her chin like Rem did.” Her light brown eyes had a hollow cast to\nthem, like she was staring at the body again, as it had been found. “Exact\nsame marks. Uncanny.”\nAnother double murder, Veil thought. Storms. What does it mean?\nVeil felt dazed, though she didn’t know if it was from drink or the\nunwelcome image of the strangled women. She went and gave the barkeep\nsome spheres—probably too many—and hooked the jug of Horneater white\nwith her thumb, then carted it out with her into the night.\n19. The Subtle Art of Diplomacy\nTHIRTY-ONE YEARS AGO\nA candle flickered on the table, and Dalinar lit the end of his napkin in it,\nsending a small braid of pungent smoke into the air. Stupid decorative\ncandles. What was the point? Looking pretty? Didn’t they use spheres\nbecause they were better than candles for light?\nAt a glare from Gavilar, Dalinar stopped burning his napkin and leaned\nback, nursing a mug of deep violet wine. The kind you could smell from\nacross the room, potent and flavorful. A feast hall spread before him, dozens\nof tables set on the floor of the large stone room. The place was far too\nwarm, and sweat prickled on his arms and forehead. Too many candles\nmaybe.\nOutside the feast hall, a storm raged like a madman who’d been locked\naway, impotent and ignored.\n“But how do you deal with highstorms, Brightlord?” Toh said to Gavilar.\nThe tall, blond-haired Westerner sat with them at the high table.\n“Good planning keeps an army from needing to be out during a storm\nexcept in rare situations,” Gavilar explained. “Holdings are common in\nAlethkar. If a campaign takes longer than anticipated, we can split the army\nand retreat back to a number of these towns for shelter.”\n“And if you’re in the middle of a siege?” Toh asked.\n“Sieges are rare out here, Brightlord Toh,” Gavilar said, chuckling.\n“Surely there are cities with fortifications,” Toh said. “Your famed\nKholinar has majestic walls, does it not?” The Westerner had a thick accent\nand spoke in a clipped, annoying way. Sounded silly.\n“You’re forgetting about Soulcasters,” Gavilar said. “Yes, sieges happen\nnow and then, but it’s very hard to starve out a city’s soldiers while there are\nSoulcasters and emeralds to make food. Instead we usually break down the\nwalls quickly, or—more commonly—we seize the high ground and use that\nvantage to pound the city for a while.”\nToh nodded, seeming fascinated. “Soulcasters. We have not these things\nin Rira or Iri. Fascinating, fascinating … And so many Shards here. Perhaps\nhalf the world’s wealth of Blades and Plates, all contained in Vorin\nkingdoms. The Heralds themselves favor you.”\nDalinar took a long pull on his wine.

Outside, thunder shook the bunker.\nThe highstorm was in full force now.\nInside, servants brought out slabs of pork and lanka claws for the men,\ncooked in a savory broth. The women dined elsewhere, including, he’d\nheard, Toh’s sister. Dalinar hadn’t met her yet. The two Western lighteyes\nhad arrived barely an hour before the storm hit.\nThe hall soon echoed with the sounds of people chatting. Dalinar tore\ninto his lanka claws, cracking them with the bottom of his mug and biting\nout the meat. This feast seemed too polite. Where was the music, the\nlaughter? The women? Eating in separate rooms?\nLife had been different these last few years of conquest. The final four\nhighprinces stood firm in their unified front. The once-frantic fighting had\nstalled. More and more of Gavilar’s time was required by the administration\nof his kingdom—which was half as big as they wanted it to be, but still\ndemanding.\nPolitics. Gavilar and Sadeas didn’t make Dalinar play at it too often, but\nhe still had to sit at feasts like this one, rather than dining with his men. He\nsucked on a claw, watching Gavilar talk to the foreigner. Storms. Gavilar\nactually looked regal, with his beard combed like that, glowing gemstones\non his fingers. He wore a uniform of the newer style. Formal, rigid. Dalinar\ninstead wore his skirtlike takama and an open overshirt that went down to\nmidthigh, his chest bare.\nSadeas held court with a group of lesser lighteyes at a table across the\nhall. Every one of that group had been carefully chosen: men with uncertain\nloyalties. He’d talk, persuade, convince. And if he was worried, he’d find\nways to eliminate them. Not with assassins, of course. They all found that\nsort of thing distasteful; it wasn’t the Alethi way. Instead, they’d maneuver\nthe man into a duel with Dalinar, or would position him at the front of an\nassault. Ialai, Sadeas’s wife, spent an impressive amount of time cooking up\nnew schemes for getting rid of problematic allies.\nDalinar finished the claws, then turned toward his pork, a succulent slab\nof meat swimming in gravy. The food was better at this feast. He just\nwished that he didn’t feel so useless here. Gavilar made alliances; Sadeas\ndealt with problems. Those two could treat a feast hall like a battlefield.\nDalinar reached to his side for his knife so he could cut the pork. Except\nthe knife wasn’t there.\nDamnation. He’d lent it to Teleb, hadn’t he? He stared down at the pork,\nsmelling its peppery sauce, his mouth watering. He reached to eat with his\nfingers, then thought to look up. Everyone else was eating primly, with\nutensils. But the servers had forgotten to bring him a knife.\nDamnation again. He sat back, wagging his mug for more wine. Nearby,\nGavilar and that foreigner continued their chat.\n“Your campaign here has been impressive, Brightlord Kholin,” Toh said.\n“One sees a glint of your ancestor in you, the great Sunmaker.”"

He reforged Alethkar, Brightlord! You shouldn’t speak so\nof one like him. You’re his descendant, correct?”\n“We all are,” Gavilar said. “House Kholin, House Sadeas … all ten\nprincedoms. Their founders were his sons, you know. So yes, signs of his\ntouch are here—yet his empire didn’t last even a single generation past his\ndeath. Leaves me wondering what was wrong with his vision, his planning,\nthat his great empire broke apart so quickly.”\nThe storm rumbled. Dalinar tried to catch the attention of a servant to\nrequest a dinner knife, but they were too busy scuttling about, seeing to the\nneeds of other demanding feastgoers.\nHe sighed, then stood—stretching—and walked to the door, holding his\nempty mug. Lost in thought, he threw aside the bar on the door, then shoved\nopen the massive wooden construction and stepped outside.\nA sheet of icy rain suddenly washed over his skin, and wind blasted him\nfiercely enough that he stumbled. The highstorm was at its raging height,\nlightning blasting down like vengeful attacks from the Heralds.\nDalinar struck out into the storm, his overshirt whipping about him.\nGavilar talked more and more about things like legacy, the kingdom,\nresponsibility. What had happened to the fun of the fight, to riding into\nbattle laughing?\nThunder crashed, and the periodic strikes of lightning were barely\nenough to see by. Still, Dalinar knew his way around well enough. This was\na highstorm waystop, a place built to house patrolling armies during storms.\nHe and Gavilar had been positioned at this one for a good four months now,\ndrawing tribute from the nearby farms and menacing House Evavakh from\njust inside its borders.\nDalinar found the particular bunker he was looking for and pounded on\nthe door. No response. So he summoned his Shardblade, slid the tip\nbetween the double doors, and sliced the bar inside. He pushed open the\ndoor to find a group of wide-eyed armed men scrambling into defensive\nlines, surrounded by fearspren, weapons held in nervous grips.\n“Teleb,” Dalinar said, standing in the doorway. “Did I lend you my belt\nknife? My favorite one, with the whitespine ivory on the grip?”\nThe tall soldier, who stood in the second rank of terrified men, gaped at\nhim. “Uh … your knife, Brightlord?”\n“Lost the thing somewhere,” Dalinar said. “I lent it to you, didn’t I?”\n“I gave it back, sir,” Teleb said. “You used it to pry that splinter out of\nyour saddle, remember?”\n“Damnation. You’re right. What did I do with that blasted thing?”\nDalinar left the doorway and strode back out into the storm.\nPerhaps Dalinar’s worries had more to do with himself than they did\nGavilar.

The Kholin battles were so calculated these days—and these last\nmonths had been more about what happened off the battlefield than on it. It\nall seemed to leave Dalinar behind like the discarded shell of a cremling\nafter it molted.\nAn explosive burst of wind drove him against the wall, and he stumbled,\nthen stepped backward, driven by instincts he couldn’t define. A large\nboulder slammed into the wall, then bounced away. Dalinar glanced and\nsaw something luminous in the distance: a gargantuan figure that moved on\nspindly glowing legs.\nDalinar stepped back up to the feast hall, gave the whatever-it-was a rude\ngesture, then pushed open the door—throwing aside two servants who had\nbeen holding it closed—and strode back in. Streaming with water, he\nwalked up to the high table, where he flopped into his chair and set down\nhis mug. Wonderful. Now he was wet and he still couldn’t eat his pork.\nEveryone had gone silent. A sea of eyes stared at him.\n“Brother?” Gavilar asked, the only sound in the room. “Is everything …\nall right?”\n“Lost my storming knife,” Dalinar said. “Thought I’d left it in the other\nbunker.” He raised his mug and took a loud, lazy slurp of rainwater.\n“Excuse me, Lord Gavilar,” Toh stammered. “I … I find myself in need\nof refreshment.” The blond-haired Westerner stood from his place, bowed,\nand retreated across the room to where a master-servant was administering\ndrinks. His face seemed even paler than those folk normally were.\n“What’s wrong with him?” Dalinar asked, scooting his chair closer to his\nbrother.\n“I assume,” Gavilar said, sounding amused, “that people he knows don’t\ncasually go for strolls in highstorms.”\n“Bah,” Dalinar said. “This is a fortified waystop, with walls and bunkers.\nWe needn’t be scared of a little wind.”\n“Toh thinks differently, I assure you.”\n“You’re grinning.”\n“You may have just proven in one moment, Dalinar, a point I’ve spent a\nhalf hour trying to make politically. Toh wonders if we’re strong enough to\nprotect him.”\n“Is that what the conversation was about?”\n“Obliquely, yes.”\n“Huh. Glad I could help.” Dalinar picked at a claw on Gavilar’s plate.\n“What does it take to get one of these fancy servants to get me a storming\nknife?”\n“They’re master-servants, Dalinar,” his brother said, making a sign by\nraising his hand in a particular way. “The sign of need, remember?”\n“No.”\n“You really need to pay better attention,” Gavilar said. “We aren’t living\nin huts anymore.”\nThey’d never lived in huts. They were Kholin, heirs to one of the world’s\ngreat cities—even if Dalinar had never seen the place before his twelfth\nyear.

He didn’t like that Gavilar was buying into the story the rest of the\nkingdom told, the one that claimed their branch of the house had until\nrecently been ruffians from the backwaters of their own princedom.\nA gaggle of servants in black and white flocked to Gavilar, and he\nrequested a new dining knife for Dalinar. As they split to run the errand, the\ndoors to the women’s feast hall opened, and a figure slipped in.\nDalinar’s breath caught. Navani’s hair glowed with the tiny rubies she’d\nwoven into it, a color matched by her pendant and bracelet. Her face a\nsultry tan, her hair Alethi jet black, her red-lipped smile so knowing and\nclever. And a figure … a figure to make a man weep for desire.\nHis brother’s wife.\nDalinar steeled himself and raised his arm in a gesture like the one\nGavilar had made. A serving man stepped up with a springy gait.\n“Brightlord,” he said, “I will see to your desires of course, though you\nmight wish to know that the sign is off. If you’ll allow me to demonstrate\n—”\nDalinar made a rude gesture. “Is this better?”\n“Uh…”\n“Wine,” Dalinar said, wagging his mug. “Violet. Enough to fill this three\ntimes at least.”\n“And what vintage would you like, Brightlord?”\nHe eyed Navani. “Whichever one is closest.”\nNavani slipped between tables, followed by the squatter form of Ialai\nSadeas. Neither seemed to care that they were the only lighteyed women in\nthe room.\n“What happened to the emissary?” Navani said as she arrived. She slid\nbetween Dalinar and Gavilar as a servant brought her a chair.\n“Dalinar scared him off,” Gavilar said.\nThe scent of her perfume was heady. Dalinar scooted his chair to the side\nand set his face. Be firm, don’t let her know how she warmed him, brought\nhim to life like nothing else but battle.\nIalai pulled a chair over for herself, and a servant brought Dalinar’s\nwine. He took a long, calming drink straight from the jug.\n“We’ve been assessing the sister,” Ialai said, leaning in from Gavilar’s\nother side. “She’s a touch vapid—”\n“A touch?” Navani asked.\n“—but I’m reasonably sure she’s being honest.”\n“The brother seems the same,” Gavilar said, rubbing his chin and\ninspecting Toh, who was nursing a drink near the bar. “Innocent, wide-eyed.\nI think he’s genuine though.”\n“He’s a sycophant,” Dalinar said with a grunt.\n“He’s a man without a home, Dalinar,” Ialai said. “No loyalty, at the\nmercy of those who take him in. And he has only one piece he can play to\nsecure his future.”\nShardplate.\nTaken from his homeland of Rira and brought east, as far as Toh could\nget from his kinsmen—who were reportedly outraged to find such a\nprecious heirloom stolen.\n“He doesn’t have the armor with him,” Gavilar said. “He’s at least smart"

He’ll want assurances before giving it to us.\nPowerful assurances.”\n“Look how he stares at Dalinar,” Navani said. “You impressed him.” She\ncocked her head. “Are you wet?”\nDalinar ran his hand through his hair. Storms. He hadn’t been\nembarrassed to stare down the crowd in the room, but before her he found\nhimself blushing.\nGavilar laughed. “He went for a stroll.”\n“You’re kidding,” Ialai said, scooting over as Sadeas joined them at the\nhigh table. The bulbous-faced man settled down on her chair with her, the\ntwo of them sitting half on, half off. He dropped a plate on the table, piled\nwith claws in a bright red sauce. Ialai attacked them immediately. She was\none of the few women Dalinar knew who liked masculine food.\n“What are we discussing?” Sadeas asked, waving away a master-servant\nwith a chair, then draping his arm around his wife’s shoulders.\n“We’re talking about getting Dalinar married,” Ialai said.\n“What?” Dalinar demanded, choking on a mouthful of wine.\n“That is the point of this, right?” Ialai said. “They want someone who\ncan protect them, someone their family will be too afraid to attack. But Toh\nand his sister, they’ll want more than just asylum. They’ll want to be part of\nthings. Inject their blood into the royal line, so to speak.”\nDalinar took another long drink.\n“You could try water sometime you know, Dalinar,” Sadeas said.\n“I had some rainwater earlier. Everyone stared at me funny.”\nNavani smiled at him. There wasn’t enough wine in the world to prepare\nhim for the gaze behind the smile, so piercing, so appraising.\n“This could be what we need,” Gavilar said. “It gives us not only the\nShard, but the appearance of speaking for Alethkar. If people outside the\nkingdom start coming to me for refuge and treaties, we might be able to\nsway the remaining highprinces. We might be able to unite this country not\nthrough further war, but through sheer weight of legitimacy.”\nA servant, at long last, arrived with a knife for Dalinar. He took it\neagerly, then frowned as the woman walked away.\n“What?” Navani asked.\n“This little thing?” Dalinar asked, pinching the dainty knife between two\nfingers and dangling it. “How am I supposed to eat a pork steak with this?”\n“Attack it,” Ialai said, making a stabbing motion. “Pretend it’s some\nthick-necked man who has been insulting your biceps.”\n“If someone insulted my biceps, I wouldn’t attack him,” Dalinar said.\n“I’d refer him to a physician, because obviously something is wrong with\nhis eyes.”\nNavani laughed, a musical sound.\n“Oh, Dalinar,” Sadeas said. “I don’t think there’s another person on\nRoshar who could have said that with a straight face.”\nDalinar grunted, then tried to maneuver the little knife into cutting the"

The meat was growing cold, but still smelled delicious. A single\nhungerspren started flitting about his head, like a tiny brown fly of the type\nyou saw out in the west near the Purelake.\n“What defeated Sunmaker?” Gavilar suddenly asked.\n“Hmm?” Ialai said.\n“Sunmaker,” Gavilar said, looking from Navani, to Sadeas, to Dalinar.\n“He united Alethkar. Why did he fail to create a lasting empire?”\n“His kids were too greedy,” Dalinar said, sawing at his steak. “Or too\nweak maybe. There wasn’t one of them that the others would agree to\nsupport.”\n“No, that’s not it,” Navani said. “They might have united, if the\nSunmaker himself could have been bothered to settle on an heir. It’s his\nfault.”\n“He was off in the west,” Gavilar said. “Leading his army to ‘further\nglory.’ Alethkar and Herdaz weren’t enough for him. He wanted the whole\nworld.”\n“So it was his ambition,” Sadeas said.\n“No, his greed,” Gavilar said quietly. “What’s the point of conquering if\nyou can never sit back and enjoy it? Shubreth-son-Mashalan, Sunmaker,\neven the Hierocracy … they all stretched farther and farther until they\ncollapsed. In all the history of mankind, has any conqueror decided they had\nenough? Has any man just said, ‘This is good. This is what I wanted,’ and\ngone home?”\n“Right now,” Dalinar said, “what I want is to eat my storming steak.” He\nheld up the little knife, which was bent in the middle.\nNavani blinked. “How in the Almighty’s tenth name did you do that?”\n“Dunno.”\nGavilar stared with that distant, far-off look in his green eyes. A look that\nwas becoming more and more common. “Why are we at war, Brother?”\n“This again?” Dalinar said. “Look, it’s not so complicated. Can’t you\nremember how it was back when we started?”\n“Remind me.”\n“Well,” Dalinar said, wagging his bent knife. “We looked at this place\nhere, this kingdom, and we realized, ‘Hey, all these people have stuff .’ And\nwe figured … hey, maybe we should have that stuff. So we took it.”\n“Oh Dalinar,” Sadeas said, chuckling. “You are a gem.”\n“Don’t you ever think about what it meant though?” Gavilar asked. “A\nkingdom? Something grander than yourself?”\n“That’s foolishness, Gavilar. When people fight, it’s about the stuff.\nThat’s it.”\n“Maybe,” Gavilar said. “Maybe. There’s something I want you to listen\nto. The Codes of War, from the old days. Back when Alethkar meant\nsomething.”\nDalinar nodded absently as the serving staff entered with teas and fruit to\nclose the meal; one tried to take his steak, and he growled at her.

She wore a delicate, filmy dress of pale\nyellow, matched by her blonde hair.\nHe leaned forward, curious. Toh’s sister Evi was eighteen, maybe\nnineteen. She was tall, almost as tall as an Alethi, and small of chest. In fact,\nthere was a certain sense of flimsiness to her, as if she were somehow less\nreal than an Alethi. The same went for her brother, with his slender build.\nBut that hair. It made her stand out, like a candle’s glow in a dark room.\nShe scampered across the feast hall to her brother, who handed her a\ndrink. She tried to take it with her left hand, which was tied inside a small\npouch of yellow cloth. The dress didn’t have sleeves, strangely.\n“She kept trying to eat with her safehand,” Navani said, eyebrow cocked.\nIalai leaned down the table toward Dalinar, speaking conspiratorially.\n“They go about half-clothed out in the far west, you know. Rirans, Iriali, the\nReshi. They aren’t as inhibited as these prim Alethi women. I bet she’s quite\nexotic in the bedroom.…”\nDalinar grunted. Then finally spotted a knife.\nIn the hand hidden behind the back of a server clearing Gavilar’s plates.\nDalinar kicked at his brother’s chair, breaking a leg off and sending\nGavilar toppling to the ground. The assassin swung at the same moment,\nclipping Gavilar’s ear, but otherwise missing. The wild swing struck the\ntable, driving the knife into the wood.\nDalinar leaped to his feet, reaching over Gavilar and grabbing the\nassassin by the neck. He spun the would-be killer around and slammed him\nto the floor with a satisfying crunch. Still in motion, Dalinar grabbed the\nknife from the table and pounded it into the assassin’s chest.\nPuffing, Dalinar stepped back and wiped the rainwater from his eyes.\nGavilar sprang to his feet, Shardblade appearing in his hand. He looked\ndown at the assassin, then at Dalinar.\nDalinar kicked at the assassin to be sure he was dead. He nodded to\nhimself, righted his chair, sat down, then leaned over and yanked the man’s\nknife from his chest. A fine blade.\nHe washed it off in his wine, then cut off a piece of his steak and shoved\nit into his mouth. Finally.\n“Good pork,” Dalinar noted around the bite.\nAcross the room, Toh and his sister were staring at Dalinar with looks\nthat mixed awe and terror. He caught a few shockspren around them, like\ntriangles of yellow light, breaking and re-forming. Rare spren, those were.\n“Thank you,” Gavilar said, touching his ear and the blood that was\ndripping from it.\nDalinar shrugged. “Sorry about killing him. You probably wanted to\nquestion him, eh?”\n“It’s no stretch to guess who sent him,” Gavilar said, settling down,\nwaving away the guards who—belatedly—rushed to help. Navani clutched"

Navani clutched\nhis arm, obviously shaken by the attack.\nSadeas cursed under his breath. “Our enemies grow desperate. Cowardly.\nAn assassin during a storm? An Alethi should be ashamed of such action.”\nAgain, everyone in the feast was gawking at the high table. Dalinar cut\nhis steak again, shoving another piece into his mouth. What? He wasn’t\ngoing to drink the wine he’d washed the blood into. He wasn’t a barbarian.\n“I know I said I wanted you free to make your own choice in regard to a\nbride,” Gavilar said. “But…”\n“I’ll do it,” Dalinar said, eyes forward. Navani was lost to him. He\nneeded to just storming accept that.\n“They’re timid and careful,” Navani noted, dabbing at Gavilar’s ear with\nher napkin. “It might take more time to persuade them.”\n“Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that,” Gavilar said, looking back at the\ncorpse. “Dalinar is nothing if not persuasive.”\n20. Cords to Bind\nHowever, with a dangerous spice, you can be warned to taste lightly. I\nwould that your lesson may not be as painful as my own.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\n“Now this,” Kaladin said, “isn’t actually that serious a wound. I know it\nlooks deep, but it’s often better to be cut deep by a sharp knife than to be\nraggedly gouged by something dull.”\nHe pressed the skin of Khen’s arm together and applied the bandage to\nher cut. “Always use clean cloth you’ve boiled—rotspren love dirty cloth.\nInfection is the real danger here; you’ll spot it as red along the outsides of\nthe wound that grows and streaks. There will be pus too. Always wash out a\ncut before binding it.”\nHe patted Khen’s arm and took back his knife, which had caused the\noffending laceration when Khen had been using it to cut branches off a\nfallen tree for firewood. Around her, the other parshmen gathered the cakes\nthey’d dried in the sun.\nThey had a surprising number of resources, all things considered.\nSeveral parshmen had thought to grab metal buckets during their raid—\nwhich had worked as pots for boiling—and the waterskins were going to be\na lifesaver. He joined Sah, the parshman who had originally been his captor,\namong the trees of their improvised camp. The parshman was lashing a\nstone axehead to a branch.\nKaladin took it from him and tested it against a log, judging how well it\nsplit the wood. “You need to lash it tighter,” Kaladin said. “Get the leather\nstrips wet and really pull as you wrap it. If you aren’t careful, it’ll fall off on\nyou midswing.”\nSah grunted, taking back the hatchet and grumbling to himself as he\nundid the lashings. He eyed Kaladin. “You can go check on someone else,\nhuman.”\n“We should march tonight,” Kaladin said. “We’ve been in one spot too"

And break into small groups, like I said.”\n“We’ll see.”\n“Look, if there’s something wrong with my advice…”\n“Nothing is wrong.”\n“But—”\nSah sighed, looking up and meeting Kaladin’s eyes. “Where did a slave\nlearn to give orders and strut about like a lighteyes?”\n“My entire life was not spent as a slave.”\n“I hate,” Sah continued, “feeling like a child.” He started rewrapping the\naxehead, tighter this time. “I hate being taught things that I should already\nknow. Most of all, I hate needing your help. We ran. We escaped. Now\nwhat? You leap in, start telling us what to do? We’re back to following\nAlethi orders again.”\nKaladin stayed silent.\n“That yellow spren isn’t any better,” Sah muttered. “Hurry up. Keep\nmoving. She tells us we’re free, then with the very next breath berates us for\nnot obeying quickly enough.”\nThey were surprised that Kaladin couldn’t see the spren. They’d also\nmentioned to him the sounds they heard, distant rhythms, almost music.\n“ ‘Freedom’ is a strange word, Sah,” Kaladin said softly, settling down.\n“These last few months, I’ve probably been more ‘free’ than at any time\nsince my childhood. You want to know what I did with it? I stayed in the\nsame place, serving another highlord. I wonder if men who use cords to\nbind are fools, since tradition, society, and momentum are going to tie us all\ndown anyway.”\n“I don’t have traditions,” Sah said. “Or society. But still, my ‘freedom’ is\nthat of a leaf. Dropped from the tree, I just blow on the wind and pretend\nI’m in charge of my destiny.”\n“That was almost poetry, Sah.”\n“I have no idea what that is.” He pulled the last lashing tight and held up\nthe new hatchet.\nKaladin took it and buried it into the log next to him. “Better.”\n“Aren’t you worried, human? Teaching us to make cakes is one thing.\nGiving us weapons is quite another.”\n“A hatchet is a tool, not a weapon.”\n“Perhaps,” Sah said. “But with this same chipping and sharpening\nmethod you taught, I will eventually make a spear.”\n“You act as if a fight is inevitable.”\nSah laughed. “You don’t think it is?”\n“You have a choice.”\n“Says the man with the brand on his forehead. If they’re willing to do\nthat to one of their own, what brutality awaits a bunch of thieving\nparshmen?”\n“Sah, it doesn’t have to come to war. You don’t have to fight the\nhumans.”\n“Perhaps. But let me ask you this.” He set the axe across his lap.\n“Considering what they did to me, why wouldn’t I?”\nKaladin couldn’t force out an objection. He remembered his own time as\na slave: the frustration, powerlessness, anger. They’d branded him with\nshash because he was dangerous. Because he’d fought back.\nDared he demand this man do otherwise?"

Your kind will expend a fortune figuring out what\nchanged to give us back our minds, and they’ll find a way to reverse it.\nThey’ll strip from me my sanity, and set me to carrying water again.”\n“Maybe … maybe we can convince them otherwise. I know good men\namong the Alethi lighteyes, Sah. If we talk to them, show them how you\ncan talk and think—that you’re like regular people—they’ll listen. They’ll\nagree to give you your freedom. That’s how they treated your cousins on the\nShattered Plains when they first met.”\nSah slammed the hatchet down into the wood, sending a chip fluttering\ninto the air. “And that’s why we should be free now? Because we’re acting\nlike you? We deserved slavery before, when we were different? It’s all right\nto dominate us when we won’t fight back, but now it’s not, because we can\ntalk?”\n“Well, I mean—”\n“That’s why I’m angry! Thank you for what you’re showing us, but\ndon’t expect me to be happy that I need you for it. This just reinforces the\nbelief within you, maybe even within myself, that your people should be the\nones who decide upon our freedom in the first place.”\nSah stalked off, and once he was gone, Syl appeared from the\nunderbrush and settled on Kaladin’s shoulder, alert—watching for the\nVoidspren—but not immediately alarmed.\n“I think I can sense a highstorm coming,” she whispered.\n“What? Really?”\nShe nodded. “It’s distant still. A day or three.” She cocked her head. “I\nsuppose I could have done this earlier, but I didn’t need to. Or know I\nwanted to. You always had the lists.”\nKaladin took a deep breath. How to protect these people from the storm?\nHe’d have to find shelter. He’d …\nI’m doing it again.\n“I can’t do this, Syl,” Kaladin whispered. “I can’t spend time with these\nparshmen, see their side.”\n“Why?”\n“Because Sah is right. This is going to come to war. The Voidspren will\ndrive the parshmen into an army, and rightly so, after what was done to\nthem. Our kind will have to fight back or be destroyed.”\n“Then find the middle ground.”\n“Middle ground only comes in war after lots of people have died—and\nonly after the important people are worried they might actually lose.\nStorms, I shouldn’t be here. I’m starting to want to defend these people!\nTeach them to fight.

Set Up to Fail\nI am no storyteller, to entertain you with whimsical yarns.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nA clamorous, insistent knocking woke Shallan. She still didn’t have a bed,\nso she slept in a heap of red hair and twisted blankets.\nShe pulled one of these over her head, but the knocking persisted,\nfollowed by Adolin’s annoyingly charming voice. “Shallan? Look, this time\nI’m going to wait to come in until you’re really sure I should.”\nShe peeked out at the sunlight, which poured through her balcony\nwindow like spilled paint. Morning? The sun was in the wrong place.\nWait … Stormfather. She’d spent the night out as Veil, then slept to the\nafternoon. She groaned, tossing off sweaty blankets, and lay there in just\nher shift, head pounding. There was an empty jug of Horneater white in the\ncorner.\n“Shallan?” Adolin said. “Are you decent?”\n“Depends,” she said, voice croaking, “on the context. I’m decent at\nsleeping.”\nShe put hands over her eyes, safehand still wrapped in an improvised\nbandage. What had gotten into her? Tossing around the symbol of the\nGhostbloods? Drinking herself silly? Stabbing a man in front of a gang of\narmed thugs?\nHer actions felt like they’d taken place in a dream.\n“Shallan,” Adolin said, sounding concerned. “I’m going to peek in.\nPalona says you’ve been in here all day.”\nShe yelped, sitting up and grabbing the bedding. When he looked, he\nfound her bundled there, a frizzy-haired head protruding from blankets—\nwhich she had pulled tight up to her chin. He looked perfect, of course.\nAdolin could look perfect after a storm, six hours of fighting, and a bath in\ncremwater. Annoying man. How did he make his hair so adorable? Messy in\njust the right way.\n“Palona said you weren’t feeling well,” Adolin said, pushing aside the\ncloth door and leaning in the doorway.\n“Blarg.”\n“Is it, um, girl stuff?”\n“Girl stuff,” she said flatly.\n“You know. When you … uh…”\n“I’m aware of the biology, Adolin, thank you. Why is it that every time a\nwoman is feeling a little odd, men are so quick to blame her cycle? As if\nshe’s suddenly unable to control herself because she has some pains.\nNobody thinks that for men. ‘Oh, stay away from Venar today. He sparred\ntoo much yesterday, so his muscles are sore, and he’s likely to rip your head\noff.’ ”\n“So it’s our fault.”\n“Yes. Like everything else. War. Famine. Bad hair.”\n“Wait. Bad hair?”\nShallan blew a lock of it out of her eyes. “Loud. Stubborn. Oblivious to\nour attempts to fix it. The Almighty gave us messy hair to prepare us for\nliving with men.”\nAdolin brought in a small pot of warm washwater for her face and hands."

She remembered occasionally\nburning off the alcohol last night, but hadn’t ever held enough Stormlight to\ncompletely fix the hand. And never enough to make her completely sober.\nAdolin set the water down, perky as a sunrise, grinning. “So what is\nwrong?”\nShe pulled the blanket up over her head and pulled it tight, like the hood\nof a cloak. “Girl stuff,” she lied.\n“See, I don’t think men would blame your cycle nearly as much if you\nall didn’t do the same. I’ve courted my share of women, and I once kept\ntrack. Deeli was once sick for womanly reasons four times in the same\nmonth.”\n“We’re very mysterious creatures.”\n“I’ll say.” He lifted up the jug and gave it a sniff. “Is this Horneater\nwhite?” He looked to her, seeming shocked—but perhaps also a little\nimpressed.\n“Got a little carried away,” Shallan grumbled. “Doing investigations\nabout your murderer.”\n“In a place serving Horneater moonshine?”\n“Back alley of the Breakaway. Nasty place. Good booze though.”\n“Shallan!” he said. “You went alone? That’s not safe.”\n“Adolin, dear,” she said, finally pulling the blanket back down to her\nshoulders, “I could literally survive being stabbed with a sword through the\nchest. I think I’ll be fine with some ruffians in the market.”\n“Oh. Right. It’s kind of easy to forget.” He frowned. “So … wait. You\ncould survive all kinds of nasty murder, but you still…”\n“Get menstrual cramps?” Shallan said. “Yeah. Mother Cultivation can be\nhateful. I’m an all-powerful, Shardblade-wielding pseudo-immortal, but\nnature still sends a friendly reminder every now and then to tell me I should\nbe getting around to having children.”\n“No mating,” Pattern buzzed softly on the wall.\n“But I shouldn’t be blaming yesterday on that,” Shallan added to Adolin.\n“My time isn’t for another few weeks. Yesterday was more about\npsychology than it was about biology.”\nAdolin set the jug down. “Yeah, well, you might want to watch out for\nthe Horneater wines.”\n“It’s not so bad,” Shallan said with a sigh. “I can burn away the\nintoxication with a little Stormlight. Speaking of which, you don’t have any\nspheres with you, do you? I seem to have … um … eaten all of mine.”\nHe chuckled. “I have one. A single sphere. Father lent it to me so I could\nstop carrying a lantern everywhere in these halls.”\nShe tried to bat her eyelashes at him. She wasn’t exactly sure how one\ndid that, or why, but it seemed to work. At the very least, he rolled his eyes\nand handed over a single ruby mark.\nShe sucked in the Light hungrily.

It had been weeks since the\nunexpected highstorm where she’d first worked the Oathgate. She looked at\nthe sphere between Adolin’s fingers.\nThose should all have gone dun by now, she thought. Even the ones\nrenewed most recently. How did they have any Stormlight at all?\nSuddenly, her actions the night before seemed even more irresponsible.\nWhen Dalinar had commanded her to practice with her powers, he probably\nhadn’t meant practicing how to avoid getting too drunk.\nShe sighed, and—still keeping the blanket on—reached for the bowl of\nwashing water. She had a lady’s maid named Marri, but she kept sending\nher away. She didn’t want the woman discovering that she was sneaking out\nor changing faces. If she kept on like that, Palona would probably assign the\nwoman to other work.\nThe water didn’t seem to have any scents or soaps applied to it, so\nShallan raised the small basin and then took a long, slurping drink.\n“I washed my feet in that,” Adolin noted.\n“No you didn’t.” Shallan smacked her lips. “Anyway, thanks for\ndragging me out of bed.”\n“Well,” he said, “I have selfish reasons. I’m kind of hoping for some\nmoral support.”\n“Don’t hit the message too hard. If you want someone to believe what\nyou’re telling them, come to your point gradually, so they’re with you the\nentire time.”\nHe cocked his head.\n“Oh, not that kind of moral,” Shallan said.\n“Talking to you can be weird sometimes.”\n“Sorry, sorry. I’ll be good.” She sat as primly and attentively as she\ncould, wrapped in a blanket with her hair sticking out like the snarls of a\nthornbush.\nAdolin took a deep breath. “My father finally persuaded Ialai Sadeas to\nspeak with me. Father hopes she’ll have some clues about her husband’s\ndeath.”\n“You sound less optimistic.”\n“I don’t like her, Shallan. She’s strange.”\nShallan opened her mouth, but he cut her off."

She’s strange.”\nShallan opened her mouth, but he cut her off.\n“Not strange like you,” he said. “Strange … bad strange. She’s always\nweighing everything and everyone she meets. She’s never treated me as\nanything other than a child. Will you go with me?”\n“Sure. How much time do I have?”\n“How much do you need?”\nShallan looked down at herself, huddled in her blankets, frizzy hair\ntickling her chin. “A lot.”\n“Then we’ll be late,” Adolin said, standing up. “It’s not like her opinion\nof me could get any worse. Meet me at Sebarial’s sitting room. Father wants\nme to take some reports from him on commerce.”\n“Tell him the booze in the market is good.”\n“Sure.” Adolin glanced again at the empty jug of Horneater white, then\nshook his head and left.\n* * *\nAn hour later, Shallan presented herself—bathed, makeup done, hair\nsomewhat under control—to Sebarial’s sitting room. The chamber was\nlarger than her room, but notably, the doorway out onto the balcony was\nenormous, taking up half the wall.\nEveryone was out on the wide balcony, which overlooked the field\nbelow. Adolin stood by the railing, lost to some contemplation. Behind him,\nSebarial and Palona lay on cots, their backs exposed to the sun, getting\nmassages.\nA flight of Horneater servants massaged, tended coal braziers, or stood\ndutifully with warmed wine and other conveniences. The air, particularly in\nthe sun, wasn’t as chilly as it had been most other days. It was almost\npleasant.\nShallan found herself caught between embarrassment—this plump,\nbearded man wearing only a towel was the highprince—and outrage. She’d\njust taken a cold bath, pouring ladles of water on her own head while\nshivering. She’d considered that a luxury, as she hadn’t been required to\nfetch the water herself.\n“How is it,” Shallan said, “that I am still sleeping on the floor, while you\nhave cots right here.”\n“Are you highprince?” Sebarial mumbled, not even opening his eyes.\n“No. I’m a Knight Radiant, which I should think is higher.”\n“I see,” he said, then groaned in pleasure at the masseuse’s touch, “and\nso you can pay to have a cot carried in from the warcamps? Or do you still\nrely on the stipend I give you? A stipend, I’ll add, that was supposed to pay\nfor your help as a scribe for my accounts—something I haven’t seen in\nweeks.”\n“She did save the world, Turi,” Palona noted from Shallan’s other side.\nThe middle-aged Herdazian woman also hadn’t opened her eyes, and\nthough she lay chest-down, her safehand was tucked only halfway under a\ntowel.\n“See, I don’t think she saved it, so much as delayed its destruction. It’s a\nmess out there, my dear.”\nNearby, the head masseuse—a large Horneater woman with vibrant red\nhair and pale skin—ordered a round of heated stones for Sebarial. Most of"

        "text": "mess out there, my dear.”\nNearby, the head masseuse—a large Horneater woman with vibrant red\nhair and pale skin—ordered a round of heated stones for Sebarial. Most of\nthe servants were probably her family. Horneaters did like to be in business\ntogether.\n“I will note,” Sebarial said, “that this Desolation of yours is going to\nundermine years of my business planning.”\n“You can’t possibly blame me for that,” Shallan said, folding her arms.\n“You did chase me out of the warcamps,” Sebarial said, “even though\nthey survived quite well. The remnants of those domes shielded them from\nthe west. The big problem was the parshmen, but those have all cleared out\nnow, marching toward Alethkar. So I plan to go back and reclaim my land\nthere before others seize it.” He opened his eyes and glanced at Shallan.\n“Your young prince didn’t want to hear that—he worries I will stretch our\nforces too thin. But those warcamps are going to be vital for trade; we can’t\nleave them completely to Thanadal and Vamah.”\nGreat. Another problem to think about. No wonder Adolin looked so\ndistracted. He’d noted they’d be late to visiting Ialai, but didn’t seem\nparticularly eager to be on the move.\n“You be a good Radiant,” Sebarial told her, “and get those other\nOathgates working. I’ve prepared quite the scheme for taxing passage\nthrough them.”\n“Callous.”\n“Necessary. The only way to survive in these mountains will be to tax\nthe Oathgates, and Dalinar knows it. He put me in charge of commerce.\nLife doesn’t stop for a war, child. Everyone will still need new shoes,\nbaskets, clothing, wine.”\n“And we need massages,” Palona added. “Lots of them, if we’re going to\nhave to live in this frozen wasteland.”\n“You two are hopeless,” Shallan snapped, walking across the sunlit\nbalcony to Adolin. “Hey. Ready?”\n“Sure.” She and Adolin struck out through the hallways. Each of the\neight highprincedoms’ armies in residence at the tower had been granted a\nquarter of the second or third level, with a few barracks on the first level,\nleaving most of that level reserved for markets and storage.\nOf course, not even the first level had been completely explored. There\nwere so many hallways and bizarre tangents—hidden sets of rooms tucked\naway behind everything else. Maybe eventually each highprince would rule\nhis quarter in earnest. For now, they occupied little pockets of civilization\nwithin the dark frontier that was Urithiru.\nExploration on the upper levels had been completely halted, as they no\nlonger had Stormlight to spare in working the lifts.\nThey left Sebarial’s quarter, passing soldiers and an intersection with\npainted arrows on the floor leading to various places, such as the nearest\nprivy. The guards’ checkpoint didn’t look like a barricade, but Adolin had\npointed out the boxes of rations, the bags of grain, set in a specific way\nbefore the soldiers. Anyone rushing this corridor from the outside would get\ntangled in all of that, plus face pikemen beyond.\nThe soldiers nodded to Adolin, but didn’t salute him, though one did"

Anyone rushing this corridor from the outside would get\ntangled in all of that, plus face pikemen beyond.\nThe soldiers nodded to Adolin, but didn’t salute him, though one did\nbark an order to two men playing cards in a nearby room. The fellows stood\nup, and Shallan was startled to recognize them. Gaz and Vathah.\n“Thought we’d take your guards today,” Adolin said.\nMy guards. Right. Shallan had a group of soldiers made up of deserters\nand despicable murderers. She didn’t mind that part, being a despicable\nmurderer herself. But she also had no idea what to do with them.\nThey saluted her lazily. Vathah, tall and scruffy. Gaz, short with a single\nbrown eye, the other socket covered by a patch. Adolin had obviously\nalready briefed them, and Vathah sauntered out to guard them in the front,\nwhile Gaz lingered behind.\nHoping they were far enough away not to hear, Shallan took Adolin by\nthe arm.\n“Do we need guards?” she whispered.\n“Of course we do.”\n“Why? You’re a Shardbearer. I’m a Radiant. I think we’ll be fine.”\n“Shallan, being guarded isn’t always about safety. It’s about prestige.”\n“I’ve got plenty. Prestige is practically leaking from my nose these days,\nAdolin.”\n“That’s not what I meant.” Adolin leaned down, whispering. “This is for\nthem. You don’t need guards, maybe, but you do need an honor guard. Men\nto be honored by their position. It’s part of the rules we play by—you get to\nbe someone important, and they get to share in it.”\n“By being useless.”\n“By being part of what you’re doing,” Adolin said. “Storms, I forget how\nnew you are to all this. What have you been doing with these men?”\n“Letting them be, mostly.”\n“What of when you need them?”\n“I don’t know if I will.”\n“You will,” Adolin said. “Shallan, you’re their commander. Maybe not\ntheir military commander, as they’re a civil guard, but it amounts to the\nsame thing. Leave them idle, make them assume they’re inconsequential,\nand you’ll ruin them. Give them something important to do instead, work\nthey’ll be proud of, and they’ll serve you with honor. A failed soldier is\noften one that has been failed.”\nShe smiled.\n“What?”\n“You sound like your father,” she said.\nHe paused, then looked away. “Nothing wrong with that.”\n“I didn’t say there was. I like it.” She held his arm. “I’ll find something\nto do with my guards, Adolin. Something useful. I promise.”\nGaz and Vathah didn’t seem to think the duty was all that important,\nfrom the way they yawned and slouched as they walked, holding out oil\nlamps, spears at their shoulders. They passed a large group of women\ncarrying water, and then some men carrying lumber to set up a new privy.\nMost made way for Vathah; seeing a personal guard was a cue to step to the\nside.\nOf course, if Shallan had really wanted to exude importance, she’d have"

She didn’t mind the vehicles; she’d used them\nextensively in Kharbranth. Maybe it was the part of Veil inside of her,\nthough, that made her resist Adolin whenever he suggested she order one.\nThere was an independence to using her own feet.\nThey reached the stairwell up, and at the top, Adolin dug in his pocket\nfor a map. The painted arrows weren’t all finished up here. Shallan tugged\nhis arm and pointed the way down a tunnel.\n“How can you know that so easily?” he said.\n“Don’t you see how wide those strata are?” she asked, pointing to the\nwall of the corridor. “It’s this way.”\nHe tucked away his map and gestured for Vathah to lead the way. “Do\nyou really think I’m like my father?” Adolin said softly as they walked.\nThere was a worried sense to his voice.\n“You are,” she said, pulling his arm tight. “You’re just like him, Adolin.\nMoral, just, and capable.”\nHe frowned.\n“What?”\n“Nothing.”\n“You’re a terrible liar. You’re worried you can’t live up to his\nexpectations, aren’t you?”\n“Maybe.”\n“Well you have, Adolin. You have lived up to them in every way. I’m\ncertain Dalinar Kholin couldn’t hope for a better son, and … storms. That\nidea bothers you.”\n“What? No!”\nShallan poked Adolin in the shoulder with her freehand. “You’re not\ntelling me something.”\n“Maybe.”\n“Well, thank the Almighty for that.”\n“Not … going to ask what it is?”\n“Ash’s eyes, no. I’d rather figure it out. A relationship needs some\nmeasure of mystery.”\nAdolin fell silent, which was all well and good, because they were\napproaching the Sadeas section of Urithiru. Though Ialai had threatened to\nrelocate back to the warcamps, she’d made no such move. Likely because\nthere was no denying that this city was now the seat of Alethi politics and\npower.\nThey reached the first guard post, and Shallan’s two guards pulled up\nclose to her and Adolin. They exchanged hostile glares with the soldiers in\nforest-green-and-white uniforms as they were allowed past. Whatever Ialai\nSadeas thought, her men had obviously made up their minds.\nIt was strange how much difference a few steps could make. In here,\nthey passed far fewer workers or merchants, and far more soldiers. Men\nwith dark expressions, unbuttoned coats, and unshaved faces of all varieties.\nEven the scribes were different—more makeup, but sloppier clothing.\nIt felt like they’d stepped from law into disorder. Loud voices echoed\ndown hallways, laughing raucously. The stripes painted to guide the way\nwere on the walls here rather than the floor, and the paint had been allowed\nto drip, spoiling the strata. They’d been smeared in places by men who had\nwalked by, their coats brushing the still-wet paint.\nThe soldiers they passed all sneered at Adolin."

They’d been smeared in places by men who had\nwalked by, their coats brushing the still-wet paint.\nThe soldiers they passed all sneered at Adolin.\n“They feel like gangs,” Shallan said softly, looking over her shoulder at\none group.\n“Don’t mistake them,” Adolin said. “They march in step, their boots are\nsturdy, and their weapons well maintained. Sadeas trained good soldiers.\nIt’s just that where Father used discipline, Sadeas used competition.\nBesides, here, looking too clean will get you mocked. You can’t be\nmistaken for a Kholin.”\nShe’d hoped that maybe, now that the truth about the Desolation had\nbeen revealed, Dalinar would have an easier time of uniting the highprinces.\nWell, that obviously wasn’t going to happen while these men blamed\nDalinar for Sadeas’s death.\nThey eventually reached the proper rooms and were ushered in to\nconfront Sadeas’s wife. Ialai was a short woman with thick lips and green\neyes. She sat in a throne at the center of the room.\nStanding beside her was Mraize, one of the leaders of the Ghostbloods.\n22. The Darkness Within\nI am no philosopher, to intrigue you with piercing questions.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nMraize. His face was crisscrossed by scars, one of which deformed his\nupper lip. Instead of his usual fashionable clothing, today he wore a Sadeas\nuniform, with a breastplate and a simple skullcap helm. He looked exactly\nlike the other soldiers they’d passed, save for that face.\nAnd the chicken on his shoulder.\nA chicken. It was one of the stranger varieties, pure green and sleek, with\na wicked beak. It looked much more like a predator than the bumbling\nthings she’d seen sold in cages at markets.\nBut seriously. Who walked around with a pet chicken? They were for\neating, right?\nAdolin noted the chicken and raised an eyebrow, but Mraize didn’t give\nany sign that he knew Shallan. He slouched like the other soldiers, holding\na halberd and glaring at Adolin.\nIalai hadn’t set out chairs for them. She sat with her hands in her lap,\nsleeved safehand beneath her freehand, lit by lamps on pedestals at either\nside of the room. She looked particularly vengeful by that unnatural\nflickering light.\n“Did you know,” Ialai said, “that after whitespines make a kill, they will\neat, then hide near the carcass?”\n“It’s one of the dangers in hunting them, Brightness,” Adolin said. “You\nassume that you’re on the beast’s trail, but it might be lurking nearby.”\n“I used to wonder at this behavior until I realized the kill will attract\nscavengers, and the whitespine is not picky. The ones that come to feast on\nits leavings become another meal themselves.”\nThe implication of the conversation seemed clear to Shallan. Why have\nyou returned to the scene of the kill, Kholin?\n“We want you to know, Brightness,” Adolin said, “that we take the\nmurder of a highprince very seriously. We are doing everything we can to\nprevent this from happening again.”\nOh, Adolin …"

We are doing everything we can to\nprevent this from happening again.”\nOh, Adolin …\n“Of course you are,” Ialai said. “The other highprinces are now too\nafraid to stand up to you.”\nYes, he’d walked right into that one. But Shallan didn’t take over; this\nwas Adolin’s task, and he’d invited her for support, not to speak for him.\nHonestly, she wouldn’t be doing much better. She’d just be making different\nmistakes.\n“Can you tell us of anyone who might have had the opportunity and\nmotive for killing your husband?” Adolin said. “Other than my father,\nBrightness.”\n“So even you admit that—”\n“It’s strange,” Adolin snapped. “My mother always said she thought you\nwere clever. She admired you, and wished she had your wit. Yet here, I see\nno proof of that. Honestly, do you really think that my father would\nwithstand Sadeas’s insults for years—weather his betrayal on the Plains,\nsuffer that dueling fiasco—only to assassinate him now? Once Sadeas was\nproven wrong about the Voidbringers, and my father’s position is secure?\nWe both know my father wasn’t behind your husband’s death. To claim\notherwise is simple idiocy.”\nShallan started. She hadn’t expected that from Adolin’s lips. Strikingly, it\nseemed to her to be the precise thing he’d needed to say. Cut away the\ncourtly language. Deliver the straight and earnest truth.\nIalai leaned forward, inspecting Adolin and chewing on his words. If\nthere was one thing Adolin could convey, it was authenticity.\n“Fetch him a chair,” Ialai said to Mraize.\n“Yes, Brightness,” he said, his voice thick with a rural accent that\nbordered on Herdazian.\nIalai then looked to Shallan. “And you. Make yourself useful. There are\nteas warming in the side room.”\nShallan sniffed at the treatment. She was no longer some inconsequential\nward, to be ordered about. However, Mraize lurched off in the same\ndirection she’d been told to go, so Shallan bore the indignity and stalked\nafter him.\nThe next room was much smaller, cut out of the same stone as the others,\nbut with a muted pattern of strata. Oranges and reds that blended together so\nevenly you could almost pretend the wall was all one hue. Ialai’s people had\nbeen using it for storage, as evidenced by the chairs in one corner. Shallan\nignored the warm jugs of tea heating on fabrials on the counter and stepped\nclose to Mraize.\n“What are you doing here?” she hissed at him.\nHis chicken chirped softly, as if in agitation.\n“I’m keeping an eye on that one,” he said, nodding toward the other\nroom. Here, his voice became refined, losing the rural edge. “We have\ninterest in her.”\n“So she’s not one of you?” Shallan asked. “She’s not a … Ghostblood?”\n“No,” he said, eyes narrowing. “She and her husband were too wild a"

Their motives are their own; I don’t think they\nalign to those of anyone else, human or listener.”\n“The fact that they’re crem didn’t enter into it, I suppose.”\n“Morality is an axis that doesn’t interest us,” Mraize said calmly. “Only\nloyalty and power are relevant, for morality is as ephemeral as the changing\nweather. It depends upon the angle from which you view it. You will see, as\nyou work with us, that I am right.”\n“I’m not one of you,” Shallan hissed.\n“For one so insistent,” Mraize said, picking up a chair, “you were\ncertainly free in using our symbol last night.”\nShallan froze, then blushed furiously. So he knew about that? “I…”\n“Your hunt is worthy,” Mraize said. “And you are allowed to rely upon\nour authority to achieve your goals. That is a benefit of your membership,\nso long as you do not abuse it.”\n“And my brothers? Where are they? You promised to deliver them to\nme.”\n“Patience, little knife. It has been but a few weeks since we rescued\nthem. You will see my word fulfilled in that matter. Regardless, I have a\ntask for you.”\n“A task?” Shallan snapped, causing the chicken to chirp at her again.\n“Mraize, I’m not going to do some task for you people. You killed Jasnah.”\n“An enemy combatant,” Mraize said. “Oh, don’t look at me like that.\nYou know full well what that woman was capable of, and what she got\nherself into by attacking us. Do you blame your wonderfully moral\nBlackthorn for what he did in war? The countless people he slaughtered?”\n“Don’t deflect your evils by pointing out the faults of others,” Shallan\nsaid. “I’m not going to further your cause. I don’t care how much you\ndemand that I Soulcast for you, I’m not going to do it.”\n“So quick to insist, yet you acknowledge your debt. One Soulcaster lost,\ndestroyed. But we forgive these things, for missions undertaken. And before\nyou object again, know that the task we require of you is one you’re already\nundertaking. Surely you have sensed the darkness in this place. The …\nwrongness.”\nShallan looked about the small room, flickering with shadows from a\nfew candles on the counter.\n“Your task,” Mraize said, “is to secure this location. Urithiru must\nremain strong if we are to properly use the advent of the Voidbringers.”\n“Use them?”\n“Yes,” Mraize said. “This is a power we will control, but we must not let\neither side gain dominance yet. Secure Urithiru. Hunt the source of the\ndarkness you feel, and expunge it. This is your task.

Shallan stood there, stunned.\nHelaran. Her eldest brother had died in Alethkar—where he’d been for\nmysterious reasons.\nStorms, what did Mraize know? She glared after him, outraged. How\ndare he tease with that name!\nDon’t focus on Helaran right now. Those were dangerous thoughts, and\nshe could not become Veil now. Shallan poured herself and Adolin cups of\ntea, then grabbed a chair under her arm and awkwardly navigated back out.\nShe sat down beside Adolin, then handed him a cup. She took a sip and\nsmiled at Ialai, who glared at her, then directed Mraize to fetch a cup.\n“I think,” Ialai said to Adolin, “that if you honestly wish to solve this\ncrime, you won’t be looking at my husband’s former enemies. Nobody had\nthe opportunity or motives that you would find in your warcamp.”\nAdolin sighed. “We established that—”\n“I’m not saying Dalinar did this,” Ialai said. She seemed calm, but she\ngripped the sides of her chair with white-knuckled hands. And her eyes …\nmakeup could not hide the redness. She’d been crying. She was truly upset.\nUnless it was an act. I could fake crying, Shallan thought, if I knew that\nsomeone was coming to see me, and if I believed the act would strengthen\nmy position.\n“Then what are you saying?” Adolin asked.\n“History is rife with examples of soldiers assuming orders when there\nwere none,” Ialai said. “I agree that Dalinar would never knife an old friend\nin dark quarters. His soldiers may not be so inhibited. You want to know\nwho did this, Adolin Kholin? Look among your own ranks. I would wager\nthe princedom that somewhere in the Kholin army is a man who thought to\ndo his highprince a service.”\n“And the other murders?” Shallan said.\n“I do not know the mind of this person,” Ialai said. “Maybe they have a\ntaste for it now? In any case, I think we can agree this meeting serves no\nfurther purpose.” She stood up. “Good day, Adolin Kholin. I hope you will\nshare what you discover with me, so that my own investigator can be better\ninformed.”\n“I suppose,” Adolin said, standing. “Who is leading your investigation?\nI’ll send him reports.”\n“His name is Meridas Amaram. I believe you know him.”\nShallan gaped. “Amaram? Highmarshal Amaram?”\n“Of course,” Ialai said. “He is among my husband’s most acclaimed\ngenerals.”\nAmaram. He’d killed her brother. She glanced at Mraize, who kept his\nexpression neutral. Storms, what did he know? She still didn’t understand\nwhere Helaran had gotten his Shardblade. What had led him to clash with\nAmaram in the first place?\n“Amaram is here?” Adolin asked. “When?”\n“He arrived with the last caravan and scavenging crew that you brought"

He didn’t make himself known to the tower, but to\nme alone. We have been seeing to his needs, as he was caught out in a storm\nwith his attendants. He assures me he will return to duty soon, and will\nmake finding my husband’s murderer a priority.”\n“I see,” Adolin said.\nHe looked to Shallan, and she nodded, still stunned. Together they\ncollected her soldiers from right inside the door, and left into the hallway\nbeyond.\n“Amaram,” Adolin hissed. “Bridgeboy isn’t going to be happy about\nthis. They have a vendetta, those two.”\nNot just Kaladin.\n“Father originally appointed Amaram to refound the Knights Radiant,”\nAdolin continued. “If Ialai has taken him in after he was so soundly\ndiscredited … The mere act of it calls Father a liar, doesn’t it? Shallan?”\nShe shook herself and took a deep breath. Helaran was long dead. She\nwould worry about getting answers from Mraize later.\n“It depends on how she spins things,” she said softly, walking beside\nAdolin. “But yes, she implies that Dalinar is at the least overly judgmental\nin his treatment of Amaram. She’s reinforcing her side as an alternative to\nyour father’s rule.”\nAdolin sighed. “I’d have thought that without Sadeas, maybe it would\nget easier.”\n“Politics is involved, Adolin—so by definition it can’t be easy.” She took\nhis arm, wrapping hers around it as they passed another group of hostile\nguards.\n“I’m terrible at this,” Adolin said softly. “I got so annoyed in there, I\nalmost punched her. You watch, Shallan. I’ll ruin this.”\n“Will you? Because I think you’re right about there being multiple\nkillers.”\n“What? Really?”\nShe nodded. “I heard some things while I was out last night.”\n“When you weren’t staggering around drunk, you mean.”\n“I’ll have you know I’m a very graceful drunk, Adolin Kholin. Let’s\ngo…” She trailed off as a pair of scribes ran past in the hallway, heading\ntoward Ialai’s rooms at a shocking speed. Guards marched after them.\nAdolin caught one by the arm, nearly provoking a fight as the man\ncursed at the blue uniform. The fellow, fortunately, recognized Adolin’s face\nand held himself back, hand moving off the axe in a sling to his side.\n“Brightlord,” the man said, reluctant.\n“What is this?” Adolin said. He nodded down the hall. “Why is everyone\nsuddenly talking at that guard post farther along?”\n“News from the coast,” the guard finally said. “Stormwall spotted in\nNew Natanan. The highstorms. They’ve returned.”\n23.

It\nreminded Kaladin of the barracks on the Shattered Plains—long and\nnarrow, with one small end pointed eastward.\n“We’ll need it to ourselves,” Kaladin said. “My brightlord values his\nprivacy.”\nThe elderly man glanced at Kaladin, taking in the blue uniform. Now\nthat the Weeping had passed, it looked better. He wouldn’t wear it to an\nofficer’s review, but he’d spent some good time scrubbing out the stains and\npolishing the buttons.\nKholin uniform in Vamah lands. It could imply a host of things.\nHopefully one of them was not “This Kholin officer has joined a bunch of\nrunaway parshmen.”\n“I can give you the whole bunker,” the merchant said. “Was supposed to\nbe renting it to some caravans out of Revolar, but they didn’t show.”\n“What happened?”\n“Don’t know,” he said. “But it’s storming strange, I’d say. Three\ncaravans, with different masters and goods, all gone silent. Not even a\nrunner to give me word. Glad I took ten percent up front.”\nRevolar. It was Vamah’s seat, the largest city between here and Kholinar.\n“We’ll take the bunker,” Kaladin said, handing over some dun spheres.\n“And whatever food you can spare.”\n“Not much, by an army’s scale. Maybe a sack of longroots or two. Some\nlavis. Was expectin’ one of those caravans to resupply me.” He shook his\nhead, expression distant. “Strange times, Corporal. That wrong-way storm.\nYou reckon it will keep coming back?”\nKaladin nodded. The Everstorm had hit again the day before, its second\noccurrence—not counting the initial one that had only come in the far east.\nKaladin and the parshmen had weathered this one, upon warning from the\nunseen spren, in an abandoned mine.\n“Strange times,” the old man said again. “Well, if you do need meat,\nthere’s been a nest of wild hogs rooting about in the ravine to the south of\nhere. This is Highlord Cadilar’s land though, so um.… Well, you just\nunderstand that.” If Kaladin’s fictional “brightlord” was traveling on the\nking’s orders, they could hunt the lands. If not, killing another highlord’s\nhogs would be poaching.\nThe old man spoke like a backwater farmer, light yellow eyes\nnotwithstanding, but he’d obviously made something of himself running a\nwaystop. A lonely life, but the money was probably quite good.\n“Let’s see what food I can find you here,” the old man said. “Follow\nalong. Now, you’re sure a storm is coming?”\n“I have charts promising it.”\n“Well, bless the Almighty and Heralds for that, I suppose. Will catch\nsome people surprised, but it will be nice to be able to work my spanreed\nagain.”\nKaladin followed the man to a stone rootshed on the leeward edge of his\nhome, and haggled—briefly—for three sacks of vegetables. “One other\nthing,” Kaladin added. “You can’t watch the army arrive.”"

Corporal, it’s my duty to see your people settled in—”\n“My brightlord is a very private person. It’s important nobody know of\nour passing. Very important.” He laid his hand on his belt knife.\nThe lighteyed man just sniffed. “I can be trusted to hold my tongue,\nsoldier. And don’t threaten me. I’m sixth dahn.” He raised his chin, but\nwhen he hobbled back into his house, he shut the door tight and pulled\nclosed the stormshutters.\nKaladin transferred the three sacks into the bunker, then hiked out to\nwhere he’d left the parshmen. He kept glancing about for Syl, but of course\nhe saw nothing. The Voidspren was following him, hidden, likely to make\nsure he didn’t do anything underhanded.\n* * *\nThey made it back right before the storm.\nKhen, Sah, and the others had wanted to wait until dark—unwilling to\ntrust that the old lighteyes wouldn’t spy on them. But the wind had started\nblowing, and they’d finally believed Kaladin that a storm was imminent.\nKaladin stood by the bunker’s doorway, anxious as the parshmen piled\nin. They’d picked up other groups in the last few days, led by unseen\nVoidspren that he was told darted away once their charges were delivered.\nTheir numbers were now verging on a hundred, including the children and\nelderly. Nobody would tell Kaladin their end goal, only that the spren had a\ndestination in mind.\nKhen was last through the door; the large, muscled parshwoman\nlingered, as if she wanted to watch the storm. Finally she took their spheres\n—most of which they’d stolen from him—and locked the sack into the iron-\nbanded lantern on the wall outside. She waved Kaladin through the door,\nthen followed, barring it closed.\n“You did well, human,” she said to Kaladin. “I’ll speak for you when we\nreach the gathering.”\n“Thanks,” Kaladin said. Outside, the stormwall hit the bunker, making\nthe stones shake and the very ground rattle.\nThe parshmen settled down to wait. Hesh dug into the sacks and\ninspected the vegetables with a critical eye. She’d worked the kitchens of a\nmanor.\nKaladin settled with his back to the wall, feeling the storm rage outside.\nStrange, how he could hate the mild Weeping so much, yet feel a thrill\nwhen he heard thunder beyond these stones. That storm had tried its best to\nkill him on several occasions. He felt a kinship to it—but still a wariness. It\nwas a sergeant who was too brutal in training his recruits.\nThe storm would renew the gems outside, which included not only\nspheres, but the larger gemstones he’d been carrying. Once renewed, he—\nwell, the parshmen—would have a wealth of Stormlight.\nHe needed to make a decision. How long could he delay flying back to\nthe Shattered Plains? Even if he had to stop at a larger city to trade his dun\nspheres for infused ones, he could probably make it in under a day."

What were they doing at Urithiru? What was\nthe word from the rest of the world? The questions hounded him. Once, he\nhad been happy to worry only about his own squad. After that, he’d been\nwilling to look after a battalion. Since when had the state of the entire world\nbecome his concern?\nI need to steal back my spanreed at the very least, and send a message to\nBrightness Navani.\nSomething flickered at the edge of his vision. Syl had come back? He\nglanced toward her, a question on his lips, and barely stopped the words as\nhe realized his error.\nThe spren beside him was glowing yellow, not blue-white. The tiny\nwoman stood on a translucent pillar of golden stone that had risen from the\nground to put her even with Kaladin’s gaze. It, like the spren herself, was\nthe yellow-white color of the center of a flame.\nShe wore a flowing dress that covered her legs entirely. Hands behind\nher back, she inspected him. Her face was shaped oddly—narrow, but with\nlarge, childlike eyes. Like someone from Shinovar.\nKaladin jumped, which caused the little spren to smile.\nPretend you don’t know anything about spren like her, Kaladin thought.\n“Um. Uh … I can see you.”\n“Because I want you to,” she said. “You are an odd one.”\n“Why … why do you want me to see you?”\n“So we can talk.” She started to stroll around him, and at each step, a\nspike of yellow stone shot up from the ground and met her bare foot. “Why\nare you still here, human?”\n“Your parshmen took me captive.”\n“Your mother teach you to lie like that?” she asked, sounding amused.\n“They’re less than a month old. Congratulations on fooling them.” She\nstopped and smiled at him. “I’m a tad older than a month.”\n“The world is changing,” Kaladin said. “The country is in upheaval. I\nguess I want to see where this goes.”\nShe contemplated him. Fortunately, he had a good excuse for the bead of\nsweat that trickled down the side of his face. Facing a strangely intelligent,\nglowing yellow spren would unnerve anyone, not just a man with too many\nthings to hide.\n“Would you fight for us, deserter?” she asked.\n“Would I be allowed?”\n“My kind aren’t nearly as inclined toward discrimination as yours. If you\ncan carry a spear and take orders, then I certainly wouldn’t turn you away.”\nShe folded her arms, smiling in a strangely knowing way. “The final\ndecision won’t be mine. I am but a messenger.”\n“Where can I find out for certain?”\n“At our destination.”\n“Which is…”\n“Close enough,” the spren said. “Why? You have pressing appointments\nelsewhere? Off for a beard trim perhaps, or a lunch date with your\ngrandmother?”\nKaladin rubbed at his face. He’d almost been able to forget about the\nhairs that prickled at the sides of his mouth."

He’d almost been able to forget about the\nhairs that prickled at the sides of his mouth.\n“Tell me,” the spren asked, “how did you know that there would be a\nhighstorm tonight?”\n“Felt it,” Kaladin said, “in my bones.”\n“Humans cannot feel storms, regardless of the body part in question.”\nHe shrugged. “Seemed like the right time for one, with the Weeping\nhaving stopped and all.”\nShe didn’t nod or give any visible sign of what she thought of that\ncomment. She merely held her knowing smile, then faded from his view.\n24. Men of Blood and Sorrow\nI have no doubt that you are smarter than I am. I can only relate what\nhappened, what I have done, and then let you draw conclusions.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nDalinar remembered.\nHer name had been Evi. She’d been tall and willowy, with pale yellow\nhair—not true golden, like the hair of the Iriali, but striking in its own right.\nShe’d been quiet. Shy, both she and her brother, for all that they’d been\nwilling to flee their homeland in an act of courage. They’d brought\nShardplate, and …\nThat was all that had emerged over the last few days. The rest was still a\nblur. He could recall meeting Evi, courting her—awkwardly, since both\nknew it was an arrangement of political necessity—and eventually entering\ninto a causal betrothal.\nHe didn’t remember love, but he did remember attraction.\nThe memories brought questions, like cremlings emerging from their\nhollows after the rain. He ignored them, standing straight-backed with a line\nof guards on the field in front of Urithiru, suffering a bitter wind from the\nwest. This wide plateau held some dumps of wood, as part of this space\nwould probably end up becoming a lumberyard.\nBehind him, the end of a rope blew in the wind, smacking a pile of wood\nagain and again. A pair of windspren danced past, in the shapes of little\npeople.\nWhy am I remembering Evi now? Dalinar wondered. And why have I\nrecovered only my first memories of our time together?\nHe had always remembered the difficult years following Evi’s death,\nwhich had culminated in his being drunk and useless on the night Szeth, the\nAssassin in White, had killed his brother. He assumed that he’d gone to the\nNightwatcher to be rid of the pain at losing her, and the spren had taken his\nother memories as payment. He didn’t know for certain, but that seemed\nright.\nBargains with the Nightwatcher were supposed to be permanent.\nDamning, even. So what was happening to him?\nDalinar glanced at his bracer clocks, strapped to his forearm. Five\nminutes late. Storms. He’d been wearing the thing barely a few days, and\nalready he was counting minutes like a scribe.\nThe second of the two watch faces—which would count down to the\nnext highstorm—still hadn’t been engaged. A single highstorm had come,\nblessedly, carrying Stormlight to renew spheres. It seemed like so long\nsince they’d had enough of that.\nHowever, it would take until the next highstorm for the scribes to make"

It seemed like so long\nsince they’d had enough of that.\nHowever, it would take until the next highstorm for the scribes to make\nguesses at the current pattern. Even then they could be wrong, as the\nWeeping had lasted far longer than it should have. Centuries—millennia—\nof careful records might now be obsolete.\nOnce, that alone would have been a catastrophe. It threatened to ruin\nplanting seasons and cause famines, to upend travel and shipping,\ndisrupting trade. Unfortunately, in the face of the Everstorm and the\nVoidbringers, it was barely third on the list of cataclysms.\nThe cold wind blew at him again. Before them, the grand plateau of\nUrithiru was ringed by ten large platforms, each raised about ten feet high,\nwith steps up beside a ramp for carts. At the center of each one was a small\nbuilding containing the device that—\nWith a bright flash, an expanding wave of Stormlight spread outward\nfrom the center of the second platform from the left. When the Light faded,\nDalinar led his troop of honor guards up the wide steps to the top. They\ncrossed to the building at the center, where a small group of people had\nstepped out and were now gawking at Urithiru, surrounded by awespren.\nDalinar smiled. The sight of a tower as wide as a city and as tall as a\nsmall mountain … well, there wasn’t anything else like it in the world.\nAt the head of the newcomers was a man in burnt orange robes. Aged,\nwith a kindly, clean-shaven face, he stood with his head tipped back and\njaw lowered as he regarded the city. Near him stood a woman with silvery\nhair pulled up in a bun. Adrotagia, the head Kharbranthian scribe.\nSome thought she was the true power behind the throne; others guessed\nit was that other scribe, the one they had left running Kharbranth in its\nking’s absence. Whoever it was, they kept Taravangian as a figurehead—\nand Dalinar was happy to work through him to get to Jah Keved and\nKharbranth. This man had been a friend to Gavilar; that was good enough\nfor Dalinar. And he was more than glad to have at least one other monarch\nat Urithiru.\nTaravangian smiled at Dalinar, then licked his lips. He seemed to have\nforgotten what he wanted to say, and had to glance at the woman beside him\nfor support. She whispered, and he spoke loudly after the reminder.\n“Blackthorn,” Taravangian said. “It is an honor to meet you again. It has\nbeen too long.”\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “Thank you so much for responding to my\ncall.” Dalinar had met Taravangian several times, years ago. He\nremembered a man of quiet, keen intelligence.\nThat was gone now. Taravangian had always been humble, and had kept\nto himself, so most didn’t know he’d been intelligent once—before his\nstrange illness five years ago, which Navani was fairly certain covered an\napoplexy that had permanently wounded his mental capacities.\nAdrotagia touched Taravangian’s arm and nodded toward someone"

        "text": "strange illness five years ago, which Navani was fairly certain covered an\napoplexy that had permanently wounded his mental capacities.\nAdrotagia touched Taravangian’s arm and nodded toward someone\nstanding with the Kharbranthian guards: a middle-aged lighteyed woman\nwearing a skirt and blouse, after a Southern style, with the top buttons of the\nblouse undone. Her hair was short in a boyish cut, and she wore gloves on\nboth hands.\nThe strange woman stretched her right hand over her head, and a\nShardblade appeared in it. She rested it with the flat side against her\nshoulder.\n“Ah yes,” Taravangian said. “Introductions! Blackthorn, this is the\nnewest Knight Radiant. Malata of Jah Keved.”\n* * *\nKing Taravangian gawked like a child as they rode the lift toward the top of\nthe tower. He leaned over the side far enough that his large Thaylen\nbodyguard rested a careful hand on the king’s shoulder, just in case.\n“So many levels,” Taravangian said. “And this balcony. Tell me,\nBrightlord. What makes it move?”\nHis sincerity was so unexpected. Dalinar had been around Alethi\npoliticians so much that he found honesty an obscure thing, like a language\nhe no longer spoke.\n“My engineers are still studying the lifts,” Dalinar said. “It has to do\nwith conjoined fabrials, they believe, with gears to modulate speed.”\nTaravangian blinked. “Oh. I meant … is this Stormlight? Or is someone\npulling somewhere? We had parshmen do ours, back in Kharbranth.”\n“Stormlight,” Dalinar said. “We had to replace the gemstones with\ninfused ones to make it work.”\n“Ah.” He shook his head, grinning.\nIn Alethkar, this man would never have been able to hold a throne after\nthe apoplexy struck him. An unscrupulous family would have removed him\nby assassination. In other families, someone would have challenged him for\nhis throne. He’d have been forced to fight or abdicate.\nOr … well, someone might have muscled him out of power, and acted\nlike king in all but name. Dalinar sighed softly, but kept a firm grip on his\nguilt.\nTaravangian wasn’t Alethi. In Kharbranth—which didn’t wage war—a\nmild, congenial figurehead made more sense. The city was supposed to be\nunassuming, unthreatening. It was a twist of luck that Taravangian had also\nbeen crowned king of Jah Keved, once one of the most powerful kingdoms\non Roshar, following its civil war.\nHe would normally have had trouble keeping that throne, but perhaps\nDalinar might lend him some support—or at least authority—through\nassociation. Dalinar certainly intended to do everything he could.\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said, stepping closer to Taravangian. “How well\nguarded is Vedenar? I have a great number of troops with too much idle\ntime. I could easily spare a battalion or two to help secure the city. We can’t\nafford to lose the Oathgate to the enemy.”\nTaravangian glanced at Adrotagia."

We can’t\nafford to lose the Oathgate to the enemy.”\nTaravangian glanced at Adrotagia.\nShe answered for him. “The city is secure, Brightlord. You needn’t fear.\nThe parshmen made one push for the city, but there are still many Veden\ntroops available. We fended the enemy off, and they withdrew eastward.”\nToward Alethkar, Dalinar thought.\nTaravangian again looked out into the wide central column, lit from the\nsheer glass window to the east. “Ah, how I wish this day hadn’t come.”\n“You sound as if you anticipated it, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said.\nTaravangian laughed softly. “Don’t you? Anticipate sorrow, I mean?\nSadness … loss…”\n“I try not to hasten my expectations in either direction,” Dalinar said.\n“The soldier’s way. Deal with today’s problems, then sleep and deal with\ntomorrow’s problems tomorrow.”\nTaravangian nodded. “I remember, as a child, listening to an ardent pray\nto the Almighty on my behalf as glyphwards burned nearby. I remember\nthinking … surely the sorrows can’t be past us. Surely the evils didn’t\nactually end. If they had, wouldn’t we be back in the Tranquiline Halls even\nnow?” He looked toward Dalinar, and surprisingly there were tears in his\npale grey eyes. “I do not think you and I are destined for such a glorious\nplace. Men of blood and sorrow don’t get an ending like that, Dalinar\nKholin.”\nDalinar found himself without a reply. Adrotagia gripped Taravangian on\nthe forearm with a comforting gesture, and the old king turned away, hiding\nhis emotional outburst. What had happened in Vedenar must have troubled\nhim deeply—the death of the previous king, the field of slaughter.\nThey rode the rest of the way in silence, and Dalinar took the chance to\nstudy Taravangian’s Surgebinder. She’d been the one to unlock—then\nactivate—the Veden Oathgate on the other side, which she’d managed after\nsome careful instructions from Navani. Now the woman, Malata, leaned\nidly against the side of the balcony. She hadn’t spoken much during their\ntour of the first three levels, and when she looked at Dalinar, she always\nseemed to have a hint of a smile on her lips.\nShe carried a wealth of spheres in her skirt pocket; the light shone\nthrough the fabric. Perhaps that was why she smiled. He himself felt\nrelieved to have Light at his fingertips again—and not only because it meant\nthe Alethi Soulcasters could get back to work, using their emeralds to\ntransform rock to grain to feed the hungry people of the tower.\nNavani met them at the top level, immaculate in an ornate silver and\nblack havah, her hair in a bun and stabbed through with hairspikes meant to\nresemble Shardblades. She greeted Taravangian warmly, then clasped hands\nwith Adrotagia. After a greeting, Navani stepped back and let Teshav guide\nTaravangian and his little retinue into what they were calling the Initiation\nRoom."

This man has become an idiot.”\n“You’re not dense, Dalinar,” she said. “You’re rugged. Practical.”\n“I’ve no illusions as to the thickness of my skull, gemheart. It’s done\nright by me on more than one occasion—better a thick head than a broken\none. But I don’t know that Taravangian in his current state will be of much\nuse.”\n“Bah,” Navani said. “We’ve more than enough clever people around us,\nDalinar. Taravangian was always a friend to Alethkar during your brother’s\nreign, and a little illness shouldn’t change our treatment of him.”\n“You’re right, of course.…” He trailed off. “There’s an earnestness to\nhim, Navani. And a melancholy I hadn’t remembered. Was that always\nthere?”\n“Yes, actually.” She checked her own arm clock, like his own, though\nwith a few more gemstones attached. Some kind of new fabrial she was\ntinkering with.\n“Any news from Captain Kaladin?”\nShe shook her head. It had been days since his last check-in, but he’d\nlikely run out of infused rubies. Now that the highstorms had returned,\nthey’d expected something.\nIn the room, Teshav gestured to the various pillars, each representing an\norder of Knight Radiant. Dalinar and Navani waited in the doorway,\nseparated from the rest.\n“What of the Surgebinder?” Navani whispered.\n“A Releaser. Dustbringer, though they don’t like the term. She claims her\nspren told her that.” He rubbed his chin. “I don’t like how she smiles.”\n“If she’s truly a Radiant,” Navani said, “can she be anything but\ntrustworthy? Would the spren pick someone who would act against the best\ninterests of the orders?”\nAnother question he didn’t know the answer to. He’d need to see if he\ncould determine whether her Shardblade was only that, or if it might be\nanother Honorblade in disguise.\nThe touring group moved down a set of steps toward the meeting\nchamber, which took up most of the penultimate level and sloped down to\nthe level below. Dalinar and Navani trailed after them.\nNavani, he thought. On my arm. It still gave him a heady, surreal feeling.\nDreamlike, as if this were one of his visions. He could vividly remember\ndesiring her. Thinking about her, captivated by the way she talked, the\nthings she knew, the look of her hands as she sketched—or, storms, as she\ndid something as simple as raising a spoon to her lips. He remembered\nstaring at her.\nHe remembered a specific day on a battlefield, when he had almost let\nhis jealousy of his brother lead him too far—and was surprised to feel Evi\nslipping into that memory. Her presence colored the old, crusty memory of\nthose war days with his brother."

But really, who can say? The Old Magic is said to\nbe inscrutable.”\n“No,” Navani said, folding her arms, getting a stern expression on her\nface—as if angry with a stubborn child. “In each case I’ve looked into, the\nboon and curse both lasted until death.”\n“Each case?” Dalinar said. “How many did you find?”\n“About three hundred at this point,” Navani said. “It’s been difficult to\nget any time from the researchers at the Palanaeum; everyone the world\nover is demanding research into the Voidbringers. Fortunately, His\nMajesty’s impending visit here earned me special consideration, and I had\nsome credit. They say it’s best to patronize the place in person—at least\nJasnah always said…”\nShe took a breath, steadying herself before continuing. “In any case,\nDalinar, the research is definitive. We haven’t been able to find a single case\nwhere the effects of the Old Magic wore off—and it’s not like people\nhaven’t tried over the centuries. Lore about people dealing with their curses,\nand seeking any cure for them, is practically its own genre. As my\nresearcher said, ‘Old Magic curses aren’t like a hangover, Brightness.’ ”\nShe looked up at Dalinar, and must have seen the emotion in his face, for\nshe cocked her head. “What?” she asked.\n“I’ve never had anyone to share this burden with,” he said softly. “Thank\nyou.”\n“I didn’t find anything.”\n“It doesn’t matter.”\n“Could you at least confirm with the Stormfather again that his bond\nwith you is absolutely, for sure not what’s causing the memories to come\nback?”\n“I’ll see.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled. Why would she want me to say more? I have\nspoken, and spren do not change like men. This is not my doing. It is not the\nbond.\n“He says it’s not him,” Dalinar said. “He’s … annoyed at you for asking\nagain.”\nShe kept her arms crossed. This was something she shared with her\ndaughter, a characteristic frustration with problems she couldn’t solve. As if\nshe were disappointed in the facts for not arranging themselves more\nhelpfully.\n“Maybe,” she said, “something was different about the deal you made. If\nyou can recount your visit to me sometime—with as much detail as you can\nremember—I’ll compare it to other accounts.”\nHe shook his head. “There wasn’t much. The Valley had a lot of plants.\nAnd … I remember … I asked to have my pain taken away, and she took\nmemories too. I think?” He shrugged, then noticed Navani pursing her lips,\nher stare sharpening. “I’m sorry. I—”\n“It’s not you,” Navani said. “It’s the Nightwatcher. Giving you a deal\nwhen you were probably too distraught to think straight, then erasing your\nmemory of the details?”"

Giving you a deal\nwhen you were probably too distraught to think straight, then erasing your\nmemory of the details?”\n“She’s a spren. I don’t think we can expect her to play by—or even\nunderstand—our rules.” He wished he could give her more, but even if he\ncould dredge up something, this wasn’t the time. They should be paying\nattention to their guests.\nTeshav had finished pointing out the strange glass panes on the inner\nwalls that seemed like windows, only clouded. She moved on to the pairs of\ndiscs on the floor and ceiling that looked something like the top and bottom\nof a pillar that had been removed—a feature of a number of rooms they’d\nexplored.\nOnce that was done, Taravangian and Adrotagia returned to the top of the\nroom, near the windows. The new Radiant, Malata, lounged in a seat near\nthe wall-mounted sigil of the Dustbringers, staring at it.\nDalinar and Navani climbed the steps to stand by Taravangian.\n“Breathtaking, isn’t it?” Dalinar asked. “An even better view than from the\nlift.”\n“Overwhelming,” Taravangian said. “So much space. We think … we\nthink that we are the most important things on Roshar. Yet so much of\nRoshar is empty of us.”\nDalinar cocked his head. Yes … perhaps some of the old Taravangian\nlingered in there somewhere.\n“Is this where you’ll have us meet?” Adrotagia asked, nodding toward\nthe room. “When you’ve gathered all the monarchs, will this be our council\nchamber?”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “This seems too much like a lecture hall. I don’t\nwant the monarchs to feel as if they’re being preached to.”\n“And … when will they come?” Taravangian asked, hopeful. “I am\nlooking forward to meeting the others. The king of Azir … didn’t you tell\nme there was a new one, Adrotagia? I know Queen Fen—she’s very nice.\nWill we be inviting the Shin? So mysterious. Do they even have a king?\nDon’t they live in tribes or something? Like Marati barbarians?”\nAdrotagia tapped his arm fondly, but looked to Dalinar, obviously\ncurious about the other monarchs.\nDalinar cleared his throat, but Navani spoke.\n“So far, Your Majesty,” she said, “you are the only one who has heeded\nour warning call.”\nSilence followed.\n“Thaylenah?” Adrotagia asked hopefully.\n“We’ve exchanged communications on five separate occasions,” Navani\nsaid. “In each one, the queen has dodged our requests. Azir has been even\nmore stubborn.”\n“Iri dismissed us almost outright,” Dalinar said with a sigh. “Neither\nMarabethia nor Rira would respond to the initial request. There’s no real\ngovernment in the Reshi Isles or some of the middle states. Babatharnam’s\nMost Ancient has been coy, and most of the Makabaki states imply that\nthey’re waiting for Azir to make a decision. The Shin sent only a quick\nreply to congratulate us, whatever that means.”"

Azir, Thaylen City, and Iri seem most essential. However,\nwe’ve made overtures to everyone who will listen, Oathgate or no. New\nNatanan is being coy so far, and the Herdazians think I’m trying to trick\nthem. The Tukari scribes keep claiming they will bring my words to their\ngod-king.”\nNavani cleared her throat. “We actually got a reply from him, just a bit\nago. Teshav’s ward was monitoring the spanreeds. It’s not exactly\nencouraging.”\n“I’d like to hear it anyway.”\nShe nodded, and went to collect it from Teshav. Adrotagia gave him a\nquestioning glance, but he didn’t dismiss the two of them. He wanted them\nto feel they were part of an alliance, and perhaps they would have insights\nthat would prove helpful.\nNavani returned with a single sheet of paper. Dalinar couldn’t read the\nscript on it, but the lines seemed sweeping and grand—imperious.\n“ ‘A warning,’ ” Navani read, “ ‘from Tezim the Great, last and first man,\nHerald of Heralds and bearer of the Oathpact. His grandness, immortality,\nand power be praised. Lift up your heads and hear, men of the east, of your\nGod’s proclamation.\n“ ‘None are Radiant but him. His fury is ignited by your pitiful claims,\nand your unlawful capture of his holy city is an act of rebellion, depravity,\nand wickedness. Open your gates, men of the east, to his righteous soldiers\nand deliver unto him your spoils.\n“ ‘Renounce your foolish claims and swear yourselves to him. The\njudgment of the final storm has come to destroy all men, and only his path\nwill lead to deliverance. He deigns to send you this single mandate, and will\nnot speak it again. Even this is far above what your carnal natures deserve.’\n”\nShe lowered the paper.\n“Wow,” Adrotagia said. “Well, at least it’s clear.”\nTaravangian scratched at his head, brow furrowed, as if he didn’t agree\nwith that statement at all.\n“I guess,” Dalinar said, “we can cross the Tukari off our list of possible\nallies.”\n“I’d rather have the Emuli anyway,” Navani said. “Their soldiers might\nbe less capable, but they’re also … well, not crazy.”\n“So … we are alone?” Taravangian said, looking from Dalinar to\nAdrotagia, uncertain.\n“We are alone, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “The end of the world has\ncome, and still nobody will listen.”\nTaravangian nodded to himself. “Where do we attack first?

My\naides say it is the traditional first step for an Alethi aggression, but they also\npoint out that if you could somehow take Thaylenah, you’d completely\ncontrol the Straits and even the Depths.”\nDalinar listened to the words with dismay. It was the obvious\nassumption. So clear that even simpleminded Taravangian saw it. What else\nto make of Alethkar proposing a union? Alethkar, the great conquerors? Led\nby the Blackthorn, the man who had united his own kingdom by the sword?\nIt was the suspicion that had tainted every conversation with the other\nmonarchs. Storms, he thought. Taravangian didn’t come because he\nbelieved in my grand alliance. He assumed that if he didn’t, I wouldn’t send\nmy armies to Herdaz or Thaylenah—I’d send them to Jah Keved. To him.\n“We’re not going to attack anyone,” Dalinar said. “Our focus is on the\nVoidbringers, the true enemy. We will win the other kingdoms with\ndiplomacy.”\nTaravangian frowned. “But—”\nAdrotagia, however, touched him on the arm and quieted him. “Of\ncourse, Brightlord,” she said to Dalinar. “We understand.”\nShe thought he was lying.\nAnd are you?\nWhat would he do if nobody listened? How would he save Roshar\nwithout the Oathgates? Without resources?\nIf our plan to reclaim Kholinar works, he thought, wouldn’t it make\nsense to take the other gates the same way? Nobody would be able to fight\nboth us and the Voidbringers. We could seize their capitals and force them\n—for their own good—to join our unified war effort.\nHe’d been willing to conquer Alethkar for its own good.

She was as safe as a person could be, so\nlong as she had that Light.\nShe wore Veil’s clothing, but not yet her face. She wasn’t truly\nexploring, though she did make a mental map. She just wanted to be in this\nplace, sensing it. It could not be comprehended, but perhaps it could be felt.\nJasnah had spent years hunting for this mythical city and the information\nshe’d assumed it would hold. Navani spoke of the ancient technology she\nwas sure this place must contain. So far, she’d been disappointed. She’d\ncooed over the Oathgates, had been impressed by the system of lifts. That\nwas it. No majestic fabrials from the past, no diagrams explaining lost\ntechnology. No books or writings at all. Just dust.\nAnd darkness, Shallan thought, pausing in a circular chamber with\ncorridors splitting out in seven different directions. She had felt the\nwrongness Mraize spoke of. She’d felt it the moment she’d tried to draw\nthis place. Urithiru was like the impossible geometries of Pattern’s shape.\nInvisible, yet grating, like a discordant sound.\nShe picked a direction at random and continued, finding herself in a\ncorridor narrow enough that she could brush both walls with her fingers.\nThe strata had an emerald cast here, an alien color for stone. A hundred\nshades of wrongness.\nShe passed several small rooms before entering a much larger chamber.\nShe stepped into it, holding a diamond broam high for light, revealing that\nshe was on a raised portion at the front of a large room with curving walls\nand rows of stone … benches?\nIt’s a theater, she thought. And I’ve walked out onto the stage. Yes, she\ncould make out a balcony above. Rooms like this struck her with their\nhumanity. Everything else about this place was so empty and arid. Endless\nrooms, corridors, and caverns. Floors strewn with only the occasional bit of\ncivilization’s detritus, like rusted hinges or an old boot’s buckle.\nDecayspren huddled like barnacles on ancient doors.\nA theater was more real. More alive, despite the span of the epochs. She\nstepped into the center and twirled about, letting Veil’s coat flare around her.\n“I always imagined being up on one of these. When I was a child, becoming\na player seemed the grandest job. To get away from home, travel to new\nplaces.” To not have to be myself for at least a brief time each day.\nPattern hummed, pushing out from her coat to hover above the stage in\nthree dimensions. “What is it?”\n“It’s a stage for concerts or plays.”\n“Plays?”"

A traveling children’s troupe come to entertain her.\nShe’d taken Memories for her collection—but of course, that was now lost\nat the bottom of the ocean.\n“The Girl Who Looked Up,” she whispered.\n“What?” Pattern asked.\nShallan opened her eyes and breathed out Stormlight. She hadn’t\nsketched this particular scene, so she used what she had handy: a drawing\nshe’d done of a young child in the market. Bright and happy, too young to\ncover her safehand. The girl appeared from the Stormlight and scampered\nup the steps, then bowed to Pattern.\n“There was a girl,” Shallan said. “This was before storms, before\nmemories, and before legends—but there was still a girl. She wore a long\nscarf to blow in the wind.”\nA vibrant red scarf grew around the girl’s neck, twin tails extending far\nbehind her and flapping in a phantom wind. The players had made the scarf\nhang behind the girl using strings from above. It had seemed so real.\n“The girl in the scarf played and danced, as girls do today,” Shallan said,\nmaking the child prance around Pattern. “In fact, most things were the same\nthen as they are today. Except for one big difference. The wall.”\nShallan drained an indulgent number of spheres from her satchel, then\nsprinkled the floor of the stage with grass and vines like from her homeland.\nAcross the back of the stage, a wall grew as Shallan had imagined it. A\nhigh, terrible wall stretching toward the moons. Blocking the sky, throwing\neverything around the girl into shadow.\nThe girl stepped toward it, looking up, straining to see the top.\n“You see, in those days, a wall kept out the storms,” Shallan said. “It had\nexisted for so long, nobody knew how it had been built. That did not bother\nthem. Why wonder when the mountains began or why the sky was high?\nLike these things were, so the wall was.”\nThe girl danced in its shadow, and other people sprang up from Shallan’s\nLight. Each was a person from one of her sketches. Vathah, Gaz, Palona,\nSebarial. They worked as farmers or washwomen, doing their duties with\nheads bowed.

There is a wall. Do not go beyond it, or you shall die.”\nThe fruit seller picked up his cart and moved away. And still, the girl\nlooked up at the wall. Pattern hovered beside her and hummed happily to\nhimself.\n“Why is there a wall?” she asked the woman suckling her child. The\nwoman had Palona’s face.\n“To protect us,” the woman said.\n“To protect us from what?”\n“Very bad things. There is a wall. Do not go beyond it, or you shall die.”\nThe woman took her child and left.\nThe girl climbed a tree, peeking out the top, her scarf streaming behind\nher. “Why is there a wall?” she called to the boy sleeping lazily in the nook\nof a branch.\n“What wall?” the boy asked.\nThe girl thrust her finger pointedly toward the wall.\n“That’s not a wall,” the boy said, drowsy. Shallan had given him the face\nof one of the bridgemen, a Herdazian. “That’s just the way the sky is over\nthere.”\n“It’s a wall,” the girl said. “A giant wall.”\n“It must be there for a purpose,” the boy said. “Yes, it is a wall. Don’t go\nbeyond it, or you’ll probably die.”\n“Well,” Shallan continued, speaking from the audience, “these answers\ndid not satisfy the girl who looked up. She reasoned to herself, if the wall\nkept evil things out, then the space on this side of it should be safe.\n“So, one night while the others of the village slept, she sneaked from her\nhome with a bundle of supplies. She walked toward the wall, and indeed the\nland was safe. But it was also dark. Always in the shadow of that wall. No\nsunlight, ever, directly reached the people.”\nShallan made the illusion roll, like scenery on a scroll as the players had\nused. Only far, far more realistic. She had painted the ceiling with light, and\nlooking up, you seemed to be looking only at an infinite sky—dominated by\nthat wall.\nThis is … this is far more extensive than I’ve done before, she thought,\nsurprised. Creationspren had started to appear around her on the benches, in\nthe form of old latches or doorknobs, rolling about or moving end over end.\nWell, Dalinar had told her to practice.…\n“The girl traveled far,” Shallan said, looking back toward the stage. “No\npredators hunted her, and no storms assaulted her. The only wind was the\npleasant one that played with her scarf, and the only creatures she saw were\nthe cremlings that clicked at her as she walked.\n“At long last, the girl in the scarves stood before the wall.

And its height!\nIt reached almost to the Tranquiline Halls!”\nShallan stood and walked onto the stage, passing into a different land—\nan image of fertility, vines, trees, and grass, dominated by that terrible wall.\nIt grew spikes from its front in bristling patches.\nI didn’t draw this scene out. At least … not recently.\nShe’d drawn it as a youth, in detail, putting her imagined fancies down\non paper.\n“What happened?” Pattern said. “Shallan? I must know what happened.\nDid she turn back?”\n“Of course she didn’t turn back,” Shallan said. “She climbed. There were\noutcroppings in the wall, things like these spikes or hunched, ugly statues.\nShe had climbed the highest trees all through her youth. She could do this.”\nThe girl started climbing. Had her hair been white when she’d started?\nShallan frowned.\nShallan made the base of the wall sink into the stage, so although the girl\ngot higher, she remained chest-height to Shallan and Pattern.\n“The climb took days,” Shallan said, hand to her head. “At night, the girl\nwho looked up would tie herself a hammock out of her scarf and sleep\nthere. She picked out her village at one point, remarking on how small it\nseemed, now that she was high.\n“As she neared the top, she finally began to fear what she would find on\nthe other side. Unfortunately, this fear did not stop her. She was young, and\nquestions bothered her more than fear. So it was that she finally struggled to\nthe very top and stood to see the other side. The hidden side…”\nShallan choked up. She remembered sitting at the edge of her seat,\nlistening to this story. As a child, when moments like watching the players\nhad been the only bright spots in life.\nToo many memories of her father, and of her mother, who had loved\ntelling her stories. She tried to banish those memories, but they wouldn’t go.\nShallan turned. Her Stormlight … she’d used up almost everything she’d\npulled from her satchel. Out in the seats, a crowd of dark figures watched.\nEyeless, just shadows, people from her memories. The outline of her father,\nher mother, her brothers and a dozen others. She couldn’t create them,\nbecause she hadn’t drawn them properly. Not since she’d lost her\ncollection …\nNext to Shallan, the girl stood triumphantly on the wall’s top, her scarves\nand white hair streaming out behind her in a sudden wind. Pattern buzzed\nbeside Shallan.\n“… and on that side of the wall,” Shallan whispered, “the girl saw\nsteps.”\nThe back side of the wall was crisscrossed with enormous sets of steps\nleading down to the ground, so distant.\n“What … what does it mean?” Pattern said.\n“The girl stared at those steps,” Shallan whispered, remembering, “and\nsuddenly the gruesome statues on her side of the wall made sense. The\nspears. The way it cast everything into shadow. The wall did indeed hide\nsomething evil, something frightening.

This was too ambitious\nfor her to hold, and it left her strained, exhausted, her head starting to\npound. She let the wall fade, claiming its Stormlight. The landscape\nvanished, then finally the girl herself. Behind, the shadowed figures in the\nseats started to evaporate. Stormlight streamed back to Shallan, stoking the\nstorm inside.\n“That’s how it ended?” Pattern asked.\n“No,” Shallan said, Stormlight puffing from her lips. “She goes down,\nsees a perfect society lit by Stormlight. She steals some and brings it back.\nThe storms come as a punishment, tearing down the wall.”\n“Ah…” Pattern said, hovering beside her on the now-dull stage. “So\nthat’s how the storms first began?”\n“Of course not,” Shallan said, feeling tired. “It’s a lie, Pattern. A story. It\ndoesn’t mean anything.”\n“Then why are you crying?”\nShe wiped her eyes and turned away from the empty stage.

She held the rest of her Stormlight, a\nthrumming, violent tempest. She skidded into the hall outside, glad for\nsturdy boots and simple trousers.\nSomething shadowy moved down the corridor. Shallan gave chase, lips\ndrawn to a sneer, letting Stormlight rise from her skin and illuminate her\nsurroundings. As she ran, she pulled a string from her pocket and tied her\nhair back, becoming Radiant. Radiant would know what to do if she caught\nthis person.\nCan a person look that much like a shadow?\n“Pattern,” she shouted, thrusting her right hand forward. Luminescent\nfog formed there, becoming her Shardblade. Light escaped her lips,\ntransforming her more fully into Radiant. Luminescent wisps trailed behind\nher, and she felt it chasing her. She charged into a small round chamber and\nskidded to a stop.\nA dozen versions of herself, from drawings she’d done recently, split\naround her and dashed through the room. Shallan in her dress, Veil in her\ncoat. Shallan as a child, Shallan as a youth. Shallan as a soldier, a happy\nwife, a mother. Leaner here, plumper there. Scarred. Bright with\nexcitement. Bloodied and in pain. They vanished after passing her,\ncollapsing one after another into Stormlight that curled and twisted about\nitself before vanishing away.\nRadiant raised her Shardblade in the stance Adolin had been teaching\nher, sweat dripping down the sides of her face. The room would have been\ndark but for the Light curling off her skin and passing through her clothing\nto rise around her.\nEmpty.

Yes,\nshe was in that region, and while she was on the third level, the market’s\ncavern was a full four stories high.\nShe moved to the next slot and peered through it, trying to decide just\nwhere it let out.

It’s heading to the market.\nWith Stormlight propelling her, Radiant dashed through corridors, barely\nnoticing as she breathed out enough to transform her face into Veil’s. She\nswerved through a network of twisted passages. This maze, these enigmatic\ntunnels, were not what she’d expected from the home of the Knights\nRadiant. Shouldn’t this be a fortress, simple but grand—a beacon of light\nand strength in the dark times?\nInstead it was a puzzle. Veil stumbled out of the back corridors into\npopulated ones, then dashed past a group of children laughing and holding\nup chips for light and making shadows on the walls.\nAnother few turns took her out onto the balcony walk around the\ncavernous Breakaway market, with its bobbing lights and busy pathways.\nVeil turned left to see slots in the wall here. For ventilation?\nThe thing had come through one of these, but where had it gone after\nthat? A scream rose, shrill and cold, from the floor of the market below.\nCursing to herself, Veil took the steps at a reckless pace.

Like it was stabbed right through the center, Veil\nthought.\n“What happened here?” she demanded, still holding her Light in to keep\nit from puffing out and revealing her.\nRock eyed her while his companion—a bridgeman she thought she’d\nseen before—wrapped his hand. “Who are you to ask me this thing?”\nStorms. She was Veil right now, but she didn’t dare expose the ruse,\nespecially not in the open. “I’m on Aladar’s policing force,” she said,\ndigging in her pocket. “I have my commission here…”\n“Is fine,” Rock said, sighing, his wariness seeming to evaporate. “I did\nnothing. Some person pulled knife. I did not see him well—long coat, and a\nhat. A woman in crowd screamed, drawing my attention. Then, this man, he\nattacked.”\n“Storms. Who is dead?”\n“Dead?” The Horneater looked to his companion. “Nobody is dead.\nAttacker stabbed my hand, then ran. Was assassination attempt, maybe?\nPerson got angry about rule of tower, so he attacked me, for being in Kholin\nguard?”\nVeil felt a chill. Horneater. Tall, burly.\nThe attacker had chosen a man who looked very similar to the one she\nhad stabbed the other day. In fact, they weren’t far from All’s Alley. Just a\nfew “streets” over in the market.\nThe two bridgemen turned to leave, and Veil let them go. What more\ncould she learn? The Horneater had been targeted not because of anything\nhe’d done, but because of how he looked. And the attacker had been\nwearing a coat and hat. Like Veil usually did …\n“I thought I’d find you here.”\nVeil started, then whirled around, hand going to her belt knife. The\nspeaker was a woman in a brown havah. She had straight Alethi hair, dark\nbrown eyes, bright red painted lips, and sharp black eyebrows almost\ncertainly enhanced with makeup. Veil recognized this woman, who was\nshorter than she’d seemed while sitting down. She was one of the thieves\nthat Veil had approached at All’s Alley, the one whose eyes had lit up when\nShallan had drawn the Ghostbloods’ symbol."

She was one of the thieves\nthat Veil had approached at All’s Alley, the one whose eyes had lit up when\nShallan had drawn the Ghostbloods’ symbol.\n“What did he do to you?” the woman asked, nodding toward Rock. “Or\ndo you just have a thing for stabbing Horneaters?”\n“This wasn’t me,” Veil said.\n“I’m sure.” The woman stepped closer. “I’ve been waiting for you to\nturn up again.”\n“You should stay away, if you value your life.” Veil started off through\nthe market.\nThe short woman scrambled after her. “My name is Ishnah. I’m an\nexcellent writer. I can take dictations. I have experience moving in the\nmarket underground.”\n“You want to be my ward?”\n“Ward?” The young woman laughed. “What are we, lighteyes? I want to\njoin you.”\nThe Ghostbloods, of course. “We’re not recruiting.”\n“Please.” She took Veil by the arm. “Please. The world is wrong now.\nNothing makes sense. But you … your group … you know things. I don’t\nwant to be blind anymore.”\nShallan hesitated. She could understand that desire to do something,\nrather than just feeling the world tremble and shake. But the Ghostbloods\nwere despicable. This woman would not find what she desired among them.\nAnd if she did, then she was not the sort of person that Shallan would want\nto add to Mraize’s quiver.\n“No,” Shallan said. “Do the smart thing and forget about me and my\norganization.”\nShe pulled out of the woman’s grip and hurried away through the\nbustling market.\n26. Blackthorn Unleashed\nTWENTY-NINE YEARS AGO\nIncense burned in a brazier as large as a boulder. Dalinar sniffled as Evi\nthrew a handful of tiny papers—each folded and inscribed with a very small\nglyph—into the brazier. Fragrant smoke washed over him, then whipped in\nthe other direction as winds ripped through the warcamp, carrying\nwindspren like lines of light.\nEvi bowed her head before the brazier. She had strange beliefs, his\nbetrothed. Among her people, simple glyphwards weren’t enough for\nprayers; you needed to burn something more pungent. While she spoke of\nJezerezeh and Kelek, she said their names strangely: Yaysi and Kellai. And\nshe made no mention of the Almighty—instead she spoke of something\ncalled the One, a heretical tradition the ardents told him came from Iri.\nDalinar bowed his head for a prayer. Let me be stronger than those who\nwould kill me. Simple and to the point, the kind he figured the Almighty\nwould prefer. He didn’t feel like having Evi write it out.\n“The One watch you, near-husband,” Evi murmured. “And soften your\ntemper.” Her accent, to which he was now accustomed, was thicker than her\nbrother’s.\n“Soften it? Evi, that’s not the point of battle.”\n“You needn’t kill in anger, Dalinar. If you must fight, do it knowing that\neach death wounds the One. For we are all people in Yaysi’s sight.”"

For we are all people in Yaysi’s sight.”\n“Yeah, all right,” Dalinar said.\nThe ardents didn’t seem to mind that he was marrying someone half\npagan. “It is wisdom to bring her to Vorin truth,” Jevena—Gavilar’s head\nardent—had told him. Similar to how she’d spoken of his conquest. “Your\nsword will bring strength and glory to the Almighty.”\nIdly, he wondered what it would take to actually earn the ardents’\ndispleasure.\n“Be a man and not a beast, Dalinar,” Evi said, then pulled close to him,\nsetting her head on his shoulder and encouraging him to wrap his arms\naround her.\nHe did so with a limp gesture. Storms, he could hear the soldiers snicker\nas they passed by. The Blackthorn, being consoled before battle? Publicly\nhugging and acting lovey?\nEvi turned her head toward him for a kiss, and he presented a chaste one,\ntheir lips barely touching. She accepted that, smiling. And she did have a\nbeautiful smile. Life would have been a lot easier for him if Evi would have\njust been willing to move along with the marriage. But her traditions\ndemanded a long engagement, and her brother kept trying to get new\nprovisions into the contract.\nDalinar stomped away. In his pocket he held another glyphward: one\nprovided by Navani, who obviously worried about the accuracy of Evi’s\nforeign script. He felt at the smooth paper, and didn’t burn the prayer.\nThe stone ground beneath his feet was pocked with tiny holes—the\npinpricks of hiding grass. As he passed the tents he could see it properly,\ncovering the plain outside, waving in the wind. Tall stuff, almost as high as\nhis waist. He’d never seen grass that tall in Kholin lands.\nAcross the plain, an impressive force gathered: an army larger than any\nthey’d faced. His heart jumped in anticipation. After two years of political\nmaneuvering, here they were. A real battle with a real army.\nWin or lose, this was the fight for the kingdom. The sun was on its way\nup, and the armies had arrayed themselves north and south, so neither\nwould have it in their eyes.\nDalinar hastened to his armorers’ tent, and emerged a short time later in\nhis Plate. He climbed carefully into the saddle as one of the grooms brought\nhis horse. The large black beast wasn’t fast, but it could carry a man in\nShardplate. Dalinar guided the horse past ranks of soldiers—spearmen,\narchers, lighteyed heavy infantry, even a nice group of fifty cavalrymen\nunder Ilamar, with hooks and ropes for attacking Shardbearers.\nAnticipationspren waved like banners among them all.\nDalinar still smelled incense when he found his brother, geared up and\nmounted, patrolling the front lines. Dalinar trotted up beside Gavilar.\n“Your young friend didn’t show for the battle,” Gavilar noted.\n“Sebarial?” Dalinar said. “He’s not my friend.”\n“There’s a hole in the enemy line, still waiting for him,” Gavilar said,"

He’s a coward. If he’d arrived, he’d have had to actually pick a\nside.”\nThey rode past Tearim, Gavilar’s captain of the guard, who wore\nDalinar’s extra Plate for this battle. Technically that still belonged to Evi.\nNot Toh, but Evi herself, which was strange. What would a woman do with\nShardplate?\nGive it to a husband, apparently. Tearim saluted. He was capable with\nShards, having trained, as did many aspiring lighteyes, with borrowed sets.\n“You’ve done well, Dalinar,” Gavilar said as they rode past. “That Plate\nwill serve us today.”\nDalinar made no reply. Even though Evi and her brother had delayed\nsuch a painfully long time to even agree to the betrothal, Dalinar had done\nhis duty. He just wished he felt more for the woman. Some passion, some\ntrue emotion. He couldn’t laugh without her seeming confused by the\nconversation. He couldn’t boast without her being disappointed in his\nbloodlust. She always wanted him to hold her, as if being alone for one\nstorming minute would make her wither and blow away. And …\n“Ho!” one of the scouts called from a wooden mobile tower. She\npointed, her voice distant. “Ho, there!”\nDalinar turned, expecting an advance attack from the enemy. But no,\nKalanor’s army was still deploying. It wasn’t men that had attracted the\nscout’s attention, but horses. A small herd of them, eleven or twelve in\nnumber, galloping across the battlefield. Proud, majestic.\n“Ryshadium,” Gavilar whispered. “It’s rare they roam this far east.”\nDalinar swallowed an order to round up the beasts. Ryshadium? Yes …\nhe could see the spren trailing after them in the air. Musicspren, for some\nreason. Made no storming sense. Well, no use trying to capture the beasts.\nThey couldn’t be held unless they chose a rider.\n“I want you to do something for me today, Brother,” Gavilar said.\n“Highprince Kalanor himself needs to fall. As long as he lives, there will be\nresistance. If he dies, his line goes with him. His cousin, Loradar Vamah,\ncan seize power.”\n“Will Loradar swear to you?”\n“I’m certain of it,” Gavilar said.\n“Then I’ll find Kalanor,” Dalinar said, “and end this.”\n“He won’t join the battle easily, knowing him. But he’s a Shardbearer.\nAnd so…”\n“So we need to force him to engage.”\nGavilar smiled.\n“What?” Dalinar said.\n“I’m simply pleased to see you talking of tactics.”\n“I’m not an idiot,” Dalinar growled. He always paid attention to the\ntactics of a battle; he simply wasn’t one for endless meetings and jaw\nwagging.\nThough … even those seemed more tolerable these days. Perhaps it was\nfamiliarity.

It was the\nincreasingly obvious truth that this campaign—now stretching over many\nyears—was no quick bash and grab.\n“Bring me Kalanor, Brother,” Gavilar said. “We need the Blackthorn\ntoday.”\n“All you need do is unleash him.”\n“Ha! As if anyone existed who could leash him in the first place.”\nIsn’t that what you’ve been trying to do? Dalinar thought immediately.\nMarrying me off, talking about how we have to be “civilized” now?\nHighlighting everything I do wrong as the things we must expunge?\nHe bit his tongue, and they finished their ride down the lines. They\nparted with a nod, and Dalinar rode over to join his elites.\n“Orders, sir?” asked Rien.\n“Stay out of my way,” Dalinar said, lowering his faceplate. The\nShardplate helm sealed closed, and a hush fell over the elites. Dalinar\nsummoned Oathbringer, the sword of a fallen king, and waited. The enemy\nhad come to stop Gavilar’s continued pillage of the countryside; they would\nhave to make the first move.\nThese last few months spent attacking isolated, unprotected towns had\nmade for unfulfilling battles—but had also put Kalanor in a terrible\nposition. If he sat back in his strongholds, he allowed more of his vassals to\nbe destroyed. Already those started to wonder why they paid Kalanor taxes.\nA handful had preemptively sent messengers to Gavilar saying they would\nnot resist.\nThe region was on the brink of flipping to the Kholins. And so,\nHighprince Kalanor had been forced to leave his fortifications to engage\nhere. Dalinar shifted on his horse, waiting, planning. The moment came\nsoon enough; Kalanor’s forces started across the plain in a cautious wave,\nshields raised toward the sky.\nGavilar’s archers released flights of arrows. Kalanor’s men were well\ntrained; they maintained their formations beneath the deadly hail.\nEventually they met Kholin heavy infantry: a block of men so armored that\nit might as well have been solid stone. At the same time, mobile archer units\nsprang out to the sides. Lightly armored, they were fast. If the Kholins won\nthis battle—and Dalinar was confident of victory—it would be because of\nthe newer battlefield tactics they’d been exploring.\nThe enemy army found itself flanked—arrows pounding the sides of\ntheir assault blocks. Their lines stretched, the infantry trying to reach the\narchers, but that weakened the central block, which suffered a beating from\nthe heavy infantry. Standard spearman blocks engaged enemy units as much\nto position them as to do them harm.\nThis all happened on the scale of the battlefield. Dalinar had to climb off\nhis horse and send for a groom to walk the animal as he waited. Inside,\nDalinar fought back the Thrill, which urged him to ride in immediately.\nEventually, he picked a section of Kholin troops who were faring poorly\nagainst the enemy block. Good enough.

This was the right moment. He could feel it. He needed to\nstrike now, when the battle was pivoting between victory and loss, to draw\nout his enemy.\nGrass wriggled and pulled back in a wave before him. Like subjects\nbowing. This might be the end, his final battle in the conquest of Alethkar.\nWhat happened to him after this? Endless feasts with politicians? A brother\nwho refused to look elsewhere for battle?\nDalinar opened himself to the Thrill and drove away such worries. He\nstruck the line of enemy troops like a highstorm hitting a stack of papers.\nSoldiers scattered before him, shouting. Dalinar laid about with his\nShardblade, killing dozens on one side, then the other.\nEyes burned, arms fell limp. Dalinar breathed in the joy of the conquest,\nthe narcotic beauty of destruction. None could stand before him; all were\ntinder and he the flame. The soldier block should have been able to band\ntogether and rush him, but they were too frightened.\nAnd why shouldn’t they be? People spoke of common men bringing\ndown a Shardbearer, but surely that was a fabrication. A conceit intended to\nmake men fight back, to save Shardbearers from having to hunt them down.\nHe grinned as his horse stumbled trying to cross the bodies piling around\nit. Dalinar kicked the beast forward, and it leaped—but as it landed,\nsomething gave. The creature screamed and collapsed, dumping him.\nHe sighed, shoving aside the horse and standing. He’d broken its back;\nShardplate was not meant for such common beasts.\nOne group of soldiers tried a counterattack. Brave, but stupid. Dalinar\nfelled them with broad sweeps of his Shardblade. Next, a lighteyed officer\norganized his men to come press and try to trap Dalinar, if not with their\nskill, then their weight of bodies. He spun among them, Plate lending him\nenergy, Blade granting him precision, and the Thrill … the Thrill giving him\npurpose.\nIn moments like this, he could see why he had been created. He was\nwasted listening to men blab. He was wasted doing anything but this:\nproviding the ultimate test of men’s abilities, proving them, demanding their\nlives at the edge of a sword. He sent them to the Tranquiline Halls primed\nand ready to fight.\nHe was not a man. He was judgment.\nEnthralled, he cut down foe after foe, sensing a strange rhythm to the\nfighting, as if the blows of his sword needed to fall to the dictates of some\nunseen beat. A redness grew at the edges of his vision, eventually covering\nthe landscape like a veil. It seemed to shift and move like the coils of an eel,\ntrembling to the beats of his sword.\nHe was furious when a calling voice distracted him from the fight.\n“Dalinar!”\nHe ignored it.\n“Brightlord Dalinar! Blackthorn!”\nThat voice was like a screeching cremling, playing its song inside his\nhelm. He felled a pair of swordsmen. They’d been lighteyed, but their eyes"

They’d been lighteyed, but their eyes\nhad burned away, and you could no longer tell.\n“Blackthorn!”\nBah! Dalinar spun toward the sound.\nA man stood nearby, wearing Kholin blue. Dalinar raised his Shardblade.\nThe man backed away, raising hands with no weapon, still shouting\nDalinar’s name.\nI know him. He’s … Kadash? One of the captains among his elites.\nDalinar lowered his sword and shook his head, trying to get the buzzing\nsound out of his ears. Only then did he see—really see—what surrounded\nhim.\nThe dead. Hundreds upon hundreds of them, with shriveled coals for\neyes, their armor and weapons sheared but their bodies eerily untouched.\nAlmighty above … how many had he killed? He raised his hand to his\nhelm, turning and looking about him. Timid blades of grass crept up among\nthe bodies, pushing between arms, fingers, beside heads. He’d blanketed the\nplain so thoroughly with corpses that the grass had a difficult time finding\nplaces to rise.\nDalinar grinned in satisfaction, then grew chill. A few of those bodies\nwith burned eyes—three men he could spot—wore blue. His own men,\nbearing the armband of the elites.\n“Brightlord,” Kadash said. “Blackthorn, your task is accomplished!” He\npointed toward a troop of horsemen charging across the plain. They carried\nthe silver-on-red flag bearing a glyphpair of two mountains. Left no choice,\nHighprince Kalanor had committed to the battle. Dalinar had destroyed\nseveral companies on his own; only another Shardbearer could stop him.\n“Excellent,” Dalinar said. He pulled off his helm and took a cloth from\nKadash, using it to wipe his face. A waterskin followed. Dalinar drank the\nentire thing.\nDalinar tossed away the empty skin, his heart racing, the Thrill\nthrumming within. “Pull back the elites. Do not engage unless I fall.”\nDalinar pulled his helm back on, and felt the comforting tightness as the\nlatches cinched it into place.\n“Yes, Brightlord.”\n“Gather those of us who … fell,” Dalinar said, waving toward the Kholin\ndead. “Make certain they, and theirs, are cared for.”\n“Of course, sir.”\nDalinar dashed toward the oncoming force, his Shardplate crunching\nagainst stones. He felt sad to have to engage a Shardbearer, instead of\ncontinuing his fight against the ordinary men. No more laying waste; he\nnow had only one man to kill.\nHe could vaguely remember a time when facing lesser challenges hadn’t\nsated him as much as a good fight against someone capable. What had\nchanged?\nHis run took him toward one of the rock formations on the eastern side\nof the field—a group of enormous spires, weathered and jagged, like a row\nof stone stakes. As he entered the shadows, he could hear fighting from the\nother side.

Portions of the armies had broken off and tried to flank each\nother by rounding the formations.\nAt their base, Kalanor’s honor guard split, revealing the highprince\nhimself on horseback. His Plate was overlaid with a silver coloring, perhaps\nsteel or silver leaf. Dalinar had ordered his Plate buffed back to its normal\nslate grey; he’d never understood why people would want to “augment” the\nnatural majesty of Shardplate.\nKalanor’s horse was a tall, majestic animal, brilliant white with a long\nmane. It carried the Shardbearer with ease. A Ryshadium. Yet Kalanor\ndismounted. He patted the animal fondly on the neck, then stepped forward\nto meet Dalinar, Shardblade appearing in his hand.\n“Blackthorn,” he called. “I hear you’ve been single-handedly destroying\nmy army.”\n“They fight for the Tranquiline Halls now.”\n“Would that you had joined to lead them.”\n“Someday,” Dalinar said. “When I am too old and weak to fight here, I’ll\nwelcome being sent.”\n“Curious, how quickly tyrants grow religious. It must be convenient to\ntell yourself that your murders belong to the Almighty instead.”\n“They’d better not belong to him!” Dalinar said. “I worked hard for\nthose kills, Kalanor. The Almighty can’t have them; he can merely credit\nthem to me when weighing my soul!”\n“Then let them weigh you down to Damnation itself.” Kalanor waved\nback his honor guard, who seemed eager to throw themselves at Dalinar.\nAlas, the highprince was determined to fight on his own. He swiped with\nhis sword, a long, thin Shardblade with a large crossguard and glyphs down\nits length. “If I kill you, Blackthorn, what then?”\n“Then Sadeas gets a crack at you.”\n“No honor on this battlefield, I see.”\n“Oh, don’t pretend you are any better,” Dalinar said. “I know what you\ndid to rise to your throne. You can’t pretend to be a peacemaker now.”\n“Considering what you did to the peacemakers,” Kalanor said, “I’ll\ncount myself lucky.”\nDalinar leaped forward, falling into Bloodstance—a stance for someone\nwho didn’t care if he got hit. He was younger, more agile than his opponent.\nHe counted on being able to swing faster, harder.\nStrangely, Kalanor chose Bloodstance himself. The two clashed, bashing\ntheir swords against one another in a pattern that sent them twisting about in\na quick shuffle of footings—each trying to hit the same section of Plate\nrepeatedly, to open a hole to flesh.\nDalinar grunted, batting away his opponent’s Shardblade. Kalanor was\nold, but skilled. He had an uncanny ability to pull back before Dalinar’s\nstrikes, deflecting some of the force of the impact, preventing the metal\nfrom breaking.\nAfter furiously exchanging blows for several minutes, both men stepped\nback, a web of cracks on the left sides of their Plate leaking Stormlight into\nthe air.\n“It will happen to you too, Blackthorn,” Kalanor growled. “If you do kill\nme, someone will rise up and take your kingdom from you. It will never\nlast.”"

It will never\nlast.”\nDalinar came in for a power swing. One step forward, then a twist all the\nway about. Kalanor struck him on the right side—a solid hit, but\ninsignificant, as it was on the wrong side. Dalinar, on the other hand, came\nin with a sweeping stroke that hummed in the air. Kalanor tried to move\nwith the blow, but this one had too much momentum.\nThe Shardblade connected, destroying the section of Plate in an\nexplosion of molten sparks. Kalanor grunted and stumbled to the side,\nnearly tripping. He lowered his hand to cover the hole in his armor, which\ncontinued to leak Stormlight at the edges. Half the breastplate had shattered.\n“You fight like you lead, Kholin,” he growled. “Reckless.”\nDalinar ignored the taunt and charged instead.\nKalanor ran away, plowing through his honor guard in his haste, shoving\nsome aside and sending them tumbling, bones breaking.\nDalinar almost caught him, but Kalanor reached the edge of the large\nrock formation. He dropped his Blade—it puffed away to mist—and sprang,\ngrabbing hold of an outcropping. He started to climb.\nHe reached the base of the natural tower moments later. Boulders littered\nthe ground nearby; in the mysterious way of the storms, this had probably\nbeen a hillside until recently. The highstorm had ripped most of it away,\nleaving this unlikely formation poking into the air. It would probably soon\nget blown down.\nDalinar dropped his Blade and leapt, snagging an outcropping, his\nfingers grinding on stone. He dangled before getting a footing, then\nproceeded to climb up the steep wall after Kalanor. The other Shardbearer\ntried to kick rocks down, but they bounced off Dalinar harmlessly.\nBy the time Dalinar caught up, they had climbed some fifty feet. Down\nbelow, soldiers gathered and stared, pointing.\nDalinar reached for his opponent’s leg, but Kalanor yanked it out of the\nway and then—still hanging from the stones—summoned his Blade and\nbegan swiping down. After getting battered on the helm a few times,\nDalinar growled and let himself slide down out of the way.\nKalanor gouged a few chunks from the wall to send them clattering at\nDalinar, then dismissed his Blade and continued upward.\nDalinar followed more carefully, climbing along a parallel route to the\nside. He eventually reached the top and peeked over the edge. The summit\nof the formation was some flat-topped, broken peaks that didn’t look\nterribly sturdy. Kalanor sat on one of them, Blade across one leg, his other\nfoot dangling.\nDalinar climbed up a safe distance from his enemy, then summoned\nOathbringer. Storms. There was barely enough room up here to stand. Wind\nbuffeted him, a windspren zipping around to one side.\n“Nice view,” Kalanor said.

Though the forces had started out with equal\nnumbers, below them were far more fallen men in silver and red strewn\nacross the grassland than there were men in blue. “I wonder how many\nkings get such prime seating to watch their own downfall.”\n“You were never a king,” Dalinar said.\nKalanor stood and lifted his Blade, extending it in one hand, point\ntoward Dalinar’s chest. “That, Kholin, is all tied up in bearing and\nassumption. Shall we?”\nClever, bringing me up here, Dalinar thought. Dalinar had the obvious\nedge in a fair duel—and so Kalanor brought random chance into the fight.\nWinds, unsteady footing, a plunge that would kill even a Shardbearer.\nAt the very least, this would be a novel challenge. Dalinar stepped\nforward carefully. Kalanor changed to Windstance, a more flowing,\nsweeping style of fighting. Dalinar chose Stonestance for the solid footing\nand straightforward power.\nThey traded blows, shuffling back and forth along the line of small\npeaks. Each step scraped chips off the stones, sending them tumbling down.\nKalanor obviously wanted to draw out this fight, to maximize the time for\nDalinar to slip.\nDalinar tested back and forth, letting Kalanor fall into a rhythm, then\nbroke it to strike with everything he had, battering down in overhand blows.\nEach fanned something burning inside of Dalinar, a thirst that his earlier\nrampage hadn’t sated. The Thrill wanted more.\nDalinar scored a series of hits on Kalanor’s helm, backing him up to the\nedge, one step away from a fall. The last blow destroyed the helm entirely,\nexposing an aged face, clean-shaven, mostly bald.\nKalanor growled, teeth clenched, and struck back at Dalinar with\nunexpected ferocity. Dalinar met it Blade with Blade, then stepped forward\nto turn it into a shoving match—their weapons locked, neither with room to\nmaneuver.\nDalinar met his enemy’s gaze. In those light grey eyes, he saw\nsomething. Excitement, energy. A familiar bloodlust.\nKalanor felt the Thrill too.\nDalinar had heard others speak of it, this euphoria of the contest. The\nsecret Alethi edge. But seeing it right there, in the eyes of a man trying to\nkill him, made Dalinar furious. He should not have to share such an\nintimate feeling with this man.\nHe grunted and—in a surge of strength—tossed Kalanor back. The man\nstumbled, then slipped. He instantly dropped his Shardblade and, in a\nfrantic motion, managed to grab the rock lip as he fell.\nHelmless, Kalanor dangled. The sense of the Thrill in his eyes faded to\npanic. “Mercy,” he whispered.\n“This is a mercy,” Dalinar said, then struck him straight through the face\nwith his Shardblade.\nKalanor’s eyes burned from grey to black as he dropped off the spire,\ntrailing twin lines of black smoke. The corpse scraped rock before hitting\nfar below, on the far side of the rock formation, away from the main army."

Shadows stretched\nlong across the land as the sun met the horizon. It had been a fine fight.\nHe’d accomplished what he’d wanted. He’d conquered all who stood before\nhim.\nAnd yet he felt empty. A voice within him kept saying, “That’s it?\nWeren’t we promised more?”\nDown below, a group in Kalanor’s colors made for the fallen body. The\nhonor guard had seen where their brightlord had fallen? Dalinar felt a spike\nof outrage. That was his kill, his victory. He’d won those Shards!\nHe scrambled down in a reckless half-climb. The descent was a blur; he\nwas seeing red by the time he hit the ground. One soldier had the Blade;\nothers were arguing over the Plate, which was broken and mangled.\nDalinar attacked, killing six in moments, including the one with the\nBlade. Two others managed to run, but they were slower than he was.\nDalinar caught one by the shoulder, whipping him around and smashing\nhim down into the stones. He killed the last with a sweep of Oathbringer.\nMore. Where were more? Dalinar saw no men in red. Only some in blue\n—a beleaguered set of soldiers who flew no flag. In their center, however,\nwalked a man in Shardplate. Gavilar rested here from the battle, in a place\nbehind the lines, to take stock.\nThe hunger inside of Dalinar grew. The Thrill came upon him in a rush,\noverwhelming. Shouldn’t the strongest rule? Why should he sit back so\noften, listening to men chat instead of war?\nThere. There was the man who held what he wanted. A throne … a\nthrone and more. The woman Dalinar should have been able to claim. A\nlove he’d been forced to abandon, for what reason?\nNo, his fighting today was not done. This was not all!\nHe started toward the group, his mind fuzzy, his insides feeling a deep\nache. Passionspren—like tiny crystalline flakes—dropped around him.\nShouldn’t he have passion?\nShouldn’t he be rewarded for all he had accomplished?\nGavilar was weak. He intended to give up his momentum and rest upon\nwhat Dalinar had won for him. Well, there was one way to make certain the\nwar continued. One way to keep the Thrill alive.\nOne way for Dalinar to get everything he deserved.\nHe was running. Some of the men in Gavilar’s group raised hands in\nwelcome. Weak. No weapons presented against him! He could slaughter\nthem all before they knew what had happened. They deserved it! Dalinar\ndeserved to—\nGavilar turned toward him, pulling free his helm and smiling an open,\nhonest grin.\nDalinar pulled up, stopping with a lurch. He stared at Gavilar, his\nbrother.\nOh, Stormfather, Dalinar thought. What am I doing?\nHe let the Blade slip from his fingers and vanish. Gavilar strode up,\nunable to read Dalinar’s horrified expression behind his helm. As a blessing,"

Please tell me he didn’t\nescape you.”\n“He…” Dalinar licked his lips, breathing in and out. “He is dead.”\nDalinar pointed toward the fallen form, visible only as a bit of silvery metal\nshining amid the shadows of the rubble.\n“Dalinar, you wonderful, terrible man!” Gavilar turned toward his\nsoldiers. “Hail the Blackthorn, men. Hail him!” Gloryspren burst around\nGavilar, golden orbs that rotated around his head like a crown.\nDalinar blinked amid their cheering, and suddenly felt a shame so deep\nhe wanted to crumple up. This time, a single spren—like a falling petal\nfrom a blossom—drifted down around him.\nHe had to do something. “Blade and Plate,” Dalinar said to Gavilar\nurgently. “I won them both, but I give them to you. A gift. For your\nchildren.”\n“Ha!” Gavilar said. “Jasnah? What would she do with Shards? No, no.\nYou—”\n“Keep them,” Dalinar pled, grabbing his brother by the arm. “Please.”\n“Very well, if you insist,” Gavilar said. “I suppose you do already have\nPlate to give your heir.”\n“If I have one.”\n“You will!” Gavilar said, sending some men to recover Kalanor’s Blade\nand Plate. “Ha! Toh will have to agree, finally, that we can protect his line.

He’d invited Taravangian, the\nhighprinces, their wives, and their head scribes. Elhokar had come with\nKalami, who was scribing for him lately.\nRenarin stood beside his father in his Bridge Four uniform, looking\nuncomfortable—so basically, same as usual. Adolin lounged nearby, arms\nfolded, occasionally whispering a joke toward one of the men of Bridge\nFour.\nRadiant should be down there, engaging in this important discussion\nabout the future of the world. Instead, Shallan drew. The light was just so\ngood up here, with these broad glass windows. She was tired of feeling\ntrapped in the dark hallways of the lower levels, always feeling that\nsomething was watching her.\nShe finished her sketch, then tipped it toward Pattern, holding the\nsketchbook with her sleeved safehand. He rippled up from his post to\ninspect her drawing: the slot obstructed by a mashed-up figure with bulging,\ninhuman eyes.\n“Mmmm,” Pattern said. “Yes, that is correct.”\n“It has to be some kind of spren, right?”\n“I feel I should know,” Pattern said. “This … this is a thing from long\nago. Long, long ago…”\nShallan shivered. “Why is it here?”\n“I cannot say,” Pattern replied. “It is not a thing of us. It is of him.”\n“An ancient spren of Odium. Delightful.” Shallan flipped the page over\nthe top of her sketchbook and started on another drawing.\nThe others spoke further of their coalition, Thaylenah and Azir recurring\nas the most important countries to convince, now that Iri had made it\ncompletely clear they had joined the enemy.\n“Brightness Kalami,” Dalinar was saying. “The last report. It listed a\nlarge gathering of the enemy in Marat, was it?”\n“Yes, Brightlord,” the scribe said from her position at the reading desk.\n“Southern Marat. You hypothesized it was the low population of the region\nthat induced the Voidbringers to gather there.”\n“The Iriali have taken the chance to strike eastward, as they’ve always\nwanted to,” Dalinar said. “They’ll seize Rira and Babatharnam. Meanwhile,\nareas like Triax—around the southern half of central Roshar—continue to\ngo dark.”\nBrightness Kalami nodded, and Shallan tapped her lips with her drawing\npencil. The question raised an implication. How could cities go completely\ndark? These days major cities—particularly ports—would have hundreds of\nspanreeds in operation. Every lighteyes or merchant wanting to watch\nprices or keep in contact with distant estates would have one.\nThose in Kholinar had started working as soon as the highstorms\nreturned—and then they’d been cut off one by one. Their last reports\nclaimed that armies were gathering near the city. Then … nothing. The\nenemy seemed to be able to locate spanreeds somehow.\nAt least they’d finally gotten word from Kaladin.

He’d been unable to get to a town to find a\nwoman to scribe for him, and just wanted them to know he was safe.\nAssuming someone else hadn’t gotten the spanreed, and faked the glyph to\nput them off.\n“The enemy is making a play for the Oathgates,” Dalinar decided. “All\nof their motions, save for the gathering in Marat, indicate this. My instincts\nsay that army is planning to strike back at Azir, or even to cross and try to\nassault Jah Keved.”\n“I trust Dalinar’s assessment,” Highprince Aladar added. “If he believes\nthis course to be likely, we should listen.”\n“Bah,” said Highprince Ruthar. The oily man leaned against the wall\nacross from the others, barely paying attention. “Who cares what you say,\nAladar? It’s amazing you can even see, considering the place you’ve gone\nand stuck your head these days.”\nAladar spun and thrust his hand to the side in a summoning posture.\nDalinar stopped him, as Ruthar must have known that he would. Shallan\nshook her head, letting herself instead be drawn farther into her sketching.\nA few creationspren appeared at the top of her drawing pad, one a tiny shoe,\nthe other a pencil like the one she used.\nHer sketch was of Highprince Sadeas, drawn without a specific Memory.\nShe’d never wanted to add him to her collection. She finished the quick\nsketch, then flipped to a sketch of Brightlord Perel, the other man they’d\nfound dead in the hallways of Urithiru. She’d tried to re-create his face\nwithout wounds.\nShe flipped back and forth between the two. They do look similar,\nShallan decided. Same bulbous features. Similar build. Her next two pages\nwere pictures of the two Horneaters. Those two looked roughly similar as\nwell. And the two murdered women? Why would the man who strangled his\nwife confess to that murder, but then swear he hadn’t killed the second\nwoman? One was already enough to get you executed.\nThat spren is mimicking the violence, she thought. Killing or wounding\nin the same way as attacks from previous days. A kind of … impersonation?\nPattern hummed softly, drawing her attention. Shallan looked up to see\nsomeone strolling in her direction: a middle-aged woman with short black\nhair cut almost to the scalp. She wore a long skirt and a buttoning shirt with\na vest. Thaylen merchant clothing.\n“What is that you’re sketching, Brightness?” the woman asked in Veden.\nHearing her own language so suddenly was strange to Shallan, and her\nmind took a moment to sort through the words. “People,” Shallan said,\nclosing her drawing pad. “I enjoy figure drawing. You’re the one who came\nwith Taravangian. His Surgebinder.”\n“Malata,” she said. “Though I am not his. I came to him for\nconvenience, as Spark suggested we might look to Urithiru, now that it has\nbeen rediscovered.” She surveyed the large auditorium. Shallan could see\nno sign of her spren. “Do you suppose we really filled this entire chamber?”"

Shallan could see\nno sign of her spren. “Do you suppose we really filled this entire chamber?”\n“Ten orders,” Shallan said, “with hundreds of people in most. Yes, I’d\nassume we could fill it—in fact, I doubt everyone belonging to the orders\ncould fit in here.”\n“And now there are four of us,” she said idly, eyeing Renarin, who stood\nstiff beside his father, sweating beneath the scrutiny as people occasionally\nglanced at him.\n“Five,” Shallan said. “There’s a flying bridgeman out there somewhere\n—and those are only the ones of us gathered here. There are bound to be\nothers like you, who are still looking for a way to reach us.”\n“If they want to,” Malata said. “Things don’t have to be the way they\nwere. Why should they? It didn’t work out so well last time for the\nRadiants, did it?”\n“Maybe,” Shallan said. “But maybe this isn’t the time to experiment\neither. The Desolation has started again. We could do worse than rely upon\nthe past to survive this.”\n“Curious,” the woman said, “that we have only the word of a few stuffy\nAlethi about this entire ‘Desolation’ business, eh sister?”\nShallan blinked at the casual way it was said, along with a wink. Malata\nsmiled and sauntered back toward the front of the room.\n“Well,” Shallan whispered, “she’s annoying.”\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “It will be worse when she starts destroying\nthings.”\n“Destroying?”\n“Dustbringer,” Pattern said. “Her spren … mmm … they like to break\nwhat is around them. They want to know what is inside.”\n“Pleasant,” Shallan said, as she flipped back through her drawings. The\nthing in the crack. The dead men. This should be enough to present to\nDalinar and Adolin, which she planned to do today, now that she had her\nsketches done.\nAnd after that?\nI need to catch it, she thought. I watch the market. Eventually someone\nwill be hurt. And a few days later, this thing will try to copy that attack.\nPerhaps she could patrol the unexplored parts of the tower? Look for it,\ninstead of waiting for it to attack?\nThe dark corridors. Each tunnel like a drawing’s impossible line …\nThe room had grown quiet. Shallan shook out of her reverie and looked\nup to see what was happening: Ialai Sadeas had arrived at the meeting,\ncarried in a palanquin. She was accompanied by a familiar figure: Meridas\nAmaram was a tall man, tan eyed, with a square face and solid figure. He\nwas also a murderer, a thief, and a traitor. He had been caught trying to steal\na Shardblade—proof that what Captain Kaladin said about him was true.\nShallan gritted her teeth, but found her anger … cool. Not gone. No, she\nwould not forgive this man for killing Helaran. But the uncomfortable truth\nwas that she didn’t know why, or how, her brother had fallen to Amaram.\nShe could almost hear Jasnah whispering to her: Don’t judge without more\ndetails."

He stared murder at Amaram, though Dalinar\nrested his hand on his son’s shoulder, holding him back.\n“Brightness Sadeas,” Dalinar said. “I am glad you have agreed to join\nthe meeting. We could use your wisdom in our planning.”\n“I’m not here for your plans, Dalinar,” Ialai said. “I’m here because it\nwas a convenient place to find you all together. I’ve been in conference with\nmy advisors back at our estates, and the consensus is that the heir, my\nnephew, is too young. This is no time for House Sadeas to be without\nleadership, so I’ve made a decision.”\n“Ialai,” Dalinar said, stepping into the illusion beside his son. “Let’s talk\nabout this. Please. I have an idea that, though untraditional, might—”\n“Tradition is our ally, Dalinar,” Ialai said. “I don’t think you’ve ever\nunderstood that as you should. Highmarshal Amaram is our house’s most\ndecorated and well-regarded general. He is beloved of our soldiers, and\nknown the world over. I name him regent and heir to the house title. He is,\nfor all intents, Highprince Sadeas now. I would ask the king to ratify this.”\nShallan’s breath caught. King Elhokar looked up from his seat, where he\n—seemingly—had been lost in thought. “Is this legal?”\n“Yes,” Navani said, arms folded.\n“Dalinar,” Amaram said, stepping down several of the steps toward the\nrest of them at the bottom of the auditorium. His voice gave Shallan chills.\nThat refined diction, that perfect face, that crisp uniform … this man was\nwhat every soldier aspired to be.\nI’m not the only one who is good at playing pretend, she thought.\n“I hope,” Amaram continued, “our recent … friction will not prevent us\nfrom working together for the needs of Alethkar. I have spoken to\nBrightness Ialai, and I think I have persuaded her that our differences are\nsecondary to the greater good of Roshar.”\n“The greater good,” Dalinar said. “You think you are one to speak about\nwhat is good?”\n“Everything I’ve done is for the greater good, Dalinar,” Amaram said,\nhis voice strained. “Everything. Please. I know you intend to pursue legal\naction against me. I will stand at trial, but let us postpone that until after\nRoshar has been saved.”\nDalinar regarded Amaram for an extended, tense moment. Then he\nfinally looked to his nephew and nodded in a curt gesture.\n“The throne acknowledges your act of regency, Brightness,” Elhokar\nsaid to Ialai. “My mother will wish a formal writ, sealed and witnessed.”\n“Already done,” Ialai said.\nDalinar met the eyes of Amaram across the floating map. “Highprince,”\nDalinar finally said."

Sure.” Adolin pulled out of his father’s grip, stalking toward the\nexit.\nShallan thought only a moment, then grabbed her shoes and drawing pad\nand hurried after him. She caught up to Adolin in the hallway outside, near\nwhere the palanquins for the women were parked, and took his arm.\n“Hey,” she said softly.\nHe glanced at her, and his expression softened.\n“You want to talk?” Shallan asked. “You seem angrier about him than\nyou were before.”\n“No,” Adolin muttered, “I’m just annoyed. We’re finally rid of Sadeas,\nand now that takes his place?” He shook his head. “When I was young, I\nused to look up to him. I started getting suspicious when I was older, but I\nguess part of me still wanted him to be like they said. A man above all the\npettiness and the politics. A true soldier.”\nShallan wasn’t certain what she thought of the idea of a “true soldier”\nbeing the type who didn’t care about politics. Shouldn’t the why of what a\nman was doing be important to him?\nSoldiers didn’t talk that way. There was some ideal she couldn’t quite\ngrasp, a kind of cult of obedience—of caring only about the battlefield and\nthe challenge it presented.\nThey walked onto the lift, and Adolin fished out a free gemstone—a little\ndiamond not surrounded by a sphere—and placed it into a slot along the\nrailing. Stormlight began to drain from the stone, and the balcony shook,\nthen slowly began to descend. Removing the gem would tell the lift to stop\nat the next floor. A simple lever, pushed one way or the other, would\ndetermine whether the lift crawled upward or downward.\nThey descended past the top tier, and Adolin took up position by the\nrailing, looking out over the central shaft with the window all along one\nside. They were starting to call it the atrium—though it was an atrium that\nran up dozens upon dozens of floors.\n“Kaladin’s not going to like this,” Adolin said. “Amaram as a\nhighprince? The two of us spent weeks in jail because of the things that man\ndid.”\n“I think Amaram killed my brother.”\nAdolin wheeled around to stare at her. “What?”\n“Amaram has a Shardblade,” Shallan said. “I saw it previously in the\nhands of my brother, Helaran. He was older than I am, and left Jah Keved\nyears ago. From what I can gather, he and Amaram fought at some point,\nand Amaram killed him—taking the Blade.”\n“Shallan … that Blade. You know where Amaram got that, right?”\n“On the battlefield?”\n“From Kaladin.” Adolin raised his hand to his head. “The bridgeboy\ninsisted that he’d saved Amaram’s life by killing a Shardbearer.

I\ndidn’t know him well.”\nAnything to get off this topic. For this was something she could still tuck\naway in the back of her brain. She did not want to think about Kaladin and\nHelaran.…\nIt was a long, quiet ride to the bottom floors of the tower. Adolin wanted\nto go visit his father’s horse again, but she wasn’t interested in standing\naround smelling horse dung. She got off on the second level to make her\nway toward her rooms.\nSecrets. There are more important things in this world, Helaran had said\nto her father. More important even than you and your crimes.\nMraize knew something about this. He was withholding the secrets from\nher like sweets to entice a child to obedience. But all he wanted her to do\nwas investigate the oddities in Urithiru. That was a good thing, wasn’t it?\nShe’d have done it anyway.\nShallan meandered through the hallways, following a path where\nSebarial’s workers had affixed some sphere lanterns to hooks on the walls.\nLocked up and filled with only the cheapest diamond spheres, they\nshouldn’t be worth the effort to break into, but the light they gave was also\nrather dim.\nShe should have stayed above; her absence must have destroyed the\nillusion of the map. She felt bad about that. Was there a way she could learn\nto leave her illusions behind her? They’d need Stormlight to keep going.…\nIn any case, Shallan had needed to leave the meeting. The secrets this\ncity hid were too engaging to ignore. She stopped in the hallway and dug\nout her sketchbook, flipping through pages, looking at the faces of the dead\nmen.\nAbsently turning a page, she came across a sketch she didn’t recall\nmaking. A series of twisting, maddening lines, scribbled and unconnected.\nShe felt cold. “When did I draw this?”\nPattern moved up her dress, stopping under her neck. He hummed, an\nuncomfortable sound. “I do not remember.”\nShe flipped to the next page. Here she’d drawn a rush of lines sweeping\nout from a central point, confused and chaotic, transforming to the heads of\nhorses with the flesh ripping off, their eyes wide, equine mouths screaming.\nIt was grotesque, nauseating."

A\ndeep void, an endless corridor, something terrible and unknowable at the\nend.\nShe snapped the sketchbook shut. “What is happening to me?”\nPattern hummed in confusion. “Do we … run?”\n“Where.”\n“Away. Out of this place. Mmmmm.”\n“No.”\nShe trembled, part of her terrified, but she couldn’t abandon those\nsecrets. She had to have them, hold them, make them hers. She turned\nsharply in the corridor, taking a path away from her room. A short time\nlater, she strode into the barracks where Sebarial housed his soldiers. There\nwere plentiful spaces like this in the tower: vast networks of rooms with\nbuilt-in stone bunks in the walls. Urithiru had been a military base; that\nmuch was evident from its ability to efficiently house tens of thousands of\nsoldiers on the lower levels alone.\nIn the common room of the barracks, men lounged with coats off,\nplaying with cards or knives. Her passing caused a stir as men gaped, then\nleaped to their feet, debating between buttoning their coats and saluting.\nWhispers of “Radiant” chased her as she walked into a corridor lined with\nrooms, where the individual platoons bunked. She counted off doorways\nmarked by archaic Alethi numbers etched into the stone, then entered a\nspecific one.\nShe burst in on Vathah and his team, who sat inside playing cards by the\nlight of a few spheres. Poor Gaz sat on the chamber pot in a corner privy,\nand he yelped, pulling closed the cloth on the doorway.\nGuess I should have anticipated that, Shallan thought, covering her\nblush by sucking in a burst of Stormlight. She folded her arms and regarded\nthe others as they—lazily—climbed to their feet and saluted. They were\nonly twelve men now. Some had made their way to other jobs. A few others\nhad died in the Battle of Narak.\nShe’d kind of been hoping that they would all drift away—if only so she\nwouldn’t have to figure out what to do with them. She now realized that\nAdolin was right. That was a terrible attitude. These men were a resource\nand, all things considered, had been remarkably loyal.\n“I,” Shallan told them, “have been an awful employer.”\n“Don’t know about that, Brightness,” Red said—she still didn’t know\nhow the tall, bearded man had gotten his nickname. “The pay has come on\ntime and you haven’t gotten too many of us killed.”\n“Oi got killed,” Shob said from his bunk, where he saluted—still lying\ndown.\n“Shut up, Shob,” Vathah said. “You’re not dead.”\n“Oi’m dyin’ this time, Sarge.

I am the monster that I fear we all can\nbecome.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\n“ ‘The decision has been made,’ ” Teshav read, “ ‘to seal off this Oathgate\nuntil we can destroy it. We realize this is not the path you wished for us to\ntake, Dalinar Kholin. Know that the Prime of Azir considers you fondly,\nand looks forward to the mutual benefit of trade agreements and new\ntreaties between our nations.\n“ ‘A magical portal into the very center of our city, however, presents too\nsevere a danger. We will entertain no further pleas to open it, and suggest\nthat you accept our sovereign will. Good day, Dalinar Kholin. May Yaezir\nbless and guide you.’ ”\nDalinar punched his fist into his palm as he stood in the small stone\nchamber. Teshav and her ward occupied the writing podium and seat beside\nit, while Navani had been pacing opposite Dalinar. King Taravangian sat in\na chair by the wall, hunched forward with hands clasped, listening with a\nconcerned expression.\nThat was it then. Azir was out.\nNavani touched his arm. “I’m sorry.”\n“There’s still Thaylenah,” Dalinar said. “Teshav, see if Queen Fen will\nspeak with me today.”\n“Yes, Brightlord.”\nHe had Jah Keved and Kharbranth from Taravangian, and New Natanan\nwas responding positively. With Thaylenah, Dalinar could at least forge a\nunified Vorin coalition of all the Eastern states. That model might\neventually persuade the nations of the west to join with them.\nIf anyone remained by then.\nDalinar started pacing again as Teshav contacted Thaylenah. He\npreferred little rooms like this one; the large chambers were a reminder of\nhow enormous this place was. In a small room like this, you could pretend\nthat you were in a cozy bunker somewhere.\nOf course, even in a small chamber there were reminders that Urithiru\nwasn’t normal. The strata on the walls, like the folds of a fan. Or the holes\nthat commonly showed up at the tops of rooms, right where the walls met\nthe ceiling. The one in this room couldn’t help but remind him of Shallan’s\nreport. Was something in there, watching them?

But where would\nthey go? Abandon the Oathgates? For now, he’d quadrupled patrols and sent\nNavani’s researchers searching for a possible explanation. At least until he\ncould come up with a solution.\nAs Teshav wrote to Queen Fen, Dalinar stepped up to the wall, suddenly\nbothered by that hole. It was right by the ceiling, and too high for him to\nreach, even if he stood on a chair. Instead he breathed in Stormlight. The\nbridgemen had described using stones to climb walls, so Dalinar picked up\na wooden chair and painted its back with shining light, using the palm of his\nleft hand.\nWhen he pressed the back of the chair against the wall, it stuck. Dalinar\ngrunted, tentatively climbing up onto the seat of the chair, which hung in\nthe air at about table height.\n“Dalinar?” Navani asked.\n“Might as well make use of the time,” he said, carefully balancing on the\nchair. He jumped, grabbing the edge of the hole by the ceiling, and pulled\nhimself up to look down it.\nIt was three feet wide, and about one foot tall. It seemed endless, and he\ncould feel a faint breeze coming out of it. Was that … scraping he heard? A\nmoment later, a mink slunk into the main tunnel from a shadowed\ncrossroad, carrying a dead rat in its mouth. The tubular little animal\ntwitched its snout toward him, then carried its prize away.\n“Air is circulating through those,” Navani said as he hopped down off\nthe chair. “The method baffles us. Perhaps some fabrial we have yet to\ndiscover?”\nDalinar looked back up at the hole. Miles upon miles of even smaller\ntunnels threaded through the walls and ceilings of an already daunting\nsystem. And hiding in them somewhere, the thing that Shallan had\ndrawn …\n“She’s replied, Brightlord!” Teshav said.\n“Excellent,” Dalinar said. “Your Majesty, our time is growing short. I’d\nlike—”\n“She’s still writing,” Teshav said. “Pardon, Brightlord. She says …\num…”\n“Just read it, Teshav,” Dalinar said. “I’m used to Fen by now.”\n“ ‘Damnation, man. Are you ever going to leave me alone? I haven’t\nslept a full night in weeks. The Everstorm has hit us twice now; we’re\nbarely keeping this city from falling apart.’ ”\n“I understand, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “And am eager to send you\nthe aid I promised. Please, let us make a pact. You’ve dodged my requests\nlong enough.”\nNearby, the chair finally dropped from the wall and clattered to the floor.\nHe prepared himself for another round of verbal sparring, of half promises\nand veiled meanings. Fen had been growing increasingly formal during\ntheir exchanges.\nThe spanreed wrote, then halted almost immediately. Teshav looked at\nhim, grave.\n“ ‘No,’ ” she read.\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “This is not a time to forge on alone!\nPlease. I beg you. Listen to me!”"

Listen to me!”\n“ ‘You have to know by now,’ ” came the reply, “ ‘that this coalition is\nnever going to happen. Kholin … I’m baffled, honestly. Your garnet-lit\ntongue and pleasant words make it seem like you really assume this will\nwork.\n“ ‘Surely you see. A queen would have to be either stupid or desperate to\nlet an Alethi army into the very center of her city. I’ve been the former at\ntimes, and I might be approaching the latter, but … storms, Kholin. No. I’m\nnot going to be the one who finally lets Thaylenah fall to you people. And\non the off chance that you’re sincere, then I’m sorry.’ ”\nIt had an air of finality to it. Dalinar walked over to Teshav, looking at\nthe inscrutable squiggles on the page that somehow made up the women’s\nscript. “Can you think of anything?” he asked Navani as she sighed and\nsettled down into a chair next to Teshav.\n“No. Fen is stubborn, Dalinar.”\nDalinar glanced at Taravangian. Even he had assumed Dalinar’s purpose\nwas conquest. And who wouldn’t, considering his history?\nMaybe it would be different if I could speak to them in person, he\nthought. But without the Oathgates, that was virtually impossible.\n“Thank her for her time,” Dalinar said. “And tell her my offer remains\non the table.”\nTeshav started writing, and Navani looked to him, noting what the scribe\nhadn’t—the tension in his voice.\n“I’m fine,” he lied. “I just need time to think.”\nHe strode from the room before she could object, and his guards outside\nfell into step behind him. He wanted some fresh air; an open sky always\nseemed so inviting. His feet didn’t take him in that direction, however. He\ninstead found himself roaming through the hallways.\nWhat now?\nSame as always, people ignored him unless he had a sword in his hand.\nStorms, it was like they wanted him to come in swinging.\nHe stalked the halls for a good hour, getting nowhere. Eventually, Lyn\nthe messenger found him. Panting, she said that Bridge Four needed him,\nbut hadn’t explained why.\nDalinar followed her, Shallan’s sketch a heavy weight in his mind. Had\nthey found another murder victim? Indeed, Lyn led him to the section where\nSadeas had been killed.\nHis sense of foreboding increased. Lyn led him to a balcony, where the\nbridgemen Leyten and Peet met him. “Who was it?” he asked as he met\nthem.\n“Who…” Leyten frowned. “Oh! It’s not that, sir. It’s something else.\nThis way.”\nLeyten led him down some steps onto the wide field outside the first\nlevel of the tower, where three more bridgemen waited near some rows of\nstone planters, probably for growing tubers.\n“We noticed this by accident,” Leyten said as they walked among the\nplanters.

The hefty bridgeman had a jovial way about him, and talked to\nDalinar—a highprince—as easily as he’d talk to friends at a tavern. “We’ve\nbeen running patrols on your orders, watching for anything strange. And …\nwell, Peet noticed something strange.” He pointed up at the wall. “See that\nline?”\nDalinar squinted, picking out a gouge cut into the rock wall. What could\nscore stone like that? It almost looked like …\nHe looked down at the planter boxes nearest them. And there, hidden\nbetween two of them, was a hilt protruding from the stone floor.\nA Shardblade.\nIt was easy to miss, as the blade had sunk all the way down into the rock.\nDalinar knelt beside it, then took a handkerchief from his pocket and used it\nto grab the hilt.\nEven though he didn’t touch the Blade directly, he heard a very distant\nwhine, like a scream in the back of someone’s throat. He steeled himself,\nthen yanked the Blade out and set it across the empty planter.\nThe silvery Blade curved at the end almost like a fishhook. The weapon\nwas even wider than most Shardblades, and near the hilt it rippled in\nwavelike patterns. He knew this sword, knew it intimately. He’d carried it\nfor decades, since winning it at the Rift all those years ago.\nOathbringer.\nHe glanced upward. “The killer must have dropped it out that window. It\nclipped the stone on its way down, then landed here.”\n“That’s what we figured, Brightlord,” Peet said.\nDalinar looked down at the sword. His sword.\nNo. Not mine at all.\nHe seized the sword, bracing himself for the screams. The cries of a dead\nspren. They weren’t the shrill, painful shrieks he’d heard when touching\nother Blades, but more of a whimper. The sound of a man backed into a\ncorner, thoroughly beaten and facing something terrible, but too tired to\nkeep screaming.\nDalinar steeled himself and carried the Blade—a familiar weight—with\nthe flat side against his shoulder. He walked toward a different entrance\nback into the tower city, followed by his guards, the scout, and the five\nbridgemen.\nYou promised to carry no dead Blade, the Stormfather thundered in his\nhead.\n“Calm yourself,” Dalinar whispered. “I’m not going to bond it.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled, low and dangerous.\n“This one doesn’t scream as loudly as others. Why?”\nIt remembers your oath, the Stormfather sent. It remembers the day you\nwon it, and better the day you gave it up. It hates you—but less than it hates\nothers.\nDalinar passed a group of Hatham’s farmers who had been trying,\nwithout success, to get some lavis polyps started. He drew more than a few\nlooks; even at a tower populated by soldiers, highprinces, and Radiants,\nsomeone carrying a Shardblade in the open was an unusual sight.\n“Could it be rescued?” Dalinar whispered as they entered the tower and\nclimbed a stairway. “Could we save the spren who made this Blade?”"

It is dead, as is the man who\nbroke his oath to kill it.\nBack to the Lost Radiants and the Recreance—that fateful day when the\nknights had broken their oaths, abandoned their Shards, and walked away.\nDalinar had witnessed that in a vision, though he still had no idea what had\ncaused it.\nWhy? What had made them do something so drastic?\nHe eventually arrived at the Sadeas section of the tower, and though\nguards in forest green and white controlled access, they couldn’t deny a\nhighprince—particularly not Dalinar. Runners dashed before him to carry\nword. Dalinar followed them, using their path to judge if he was going in\nthe right direction. He was; she was apparently in her rooms. He stopped at\nthe nice wooden door, and gave Ialai the courtesy of knocking.\nOne of the runners he had chased here opened the door, still panting.\nBrightness Sadeas sat in a throne set in the center of the room. Amaram\nstood at her shoulder.\n“Dalinar,” Ialai said, nodding her head to him like a queen greeting a\nsubject.\nDalinar heaved the Shardblade off his shoulder and set it carefully on the\nfloor. Not as dramatic as spearing it through the stones, but now that he\ncould hear the weapon’s screams, he felt like treating it with reverence.\nHe turned to go.\n“Brightlord?” Ialai said, standing up. “What is this in exchange for?”\n“No exchange,” Dalinar said, turning back. “That is rightfully yours. My\nguards found it today; the killer threw it out a window.”\nShe narrowed her eyes at him.\n“I didn’t kill him, Ialai,” Dalinar said wearily.\n“I realize that. You don’t have the bite left in you to do something like\nthat.”\nHe ignored the gibe, looking to Amaram. The tall, distinguished man met\nhis gaze.\n“I will see you in judgment someday, Amaram,” Dalinar said. “Once this\nis done.”\n“As I said you could.”\n“I wish that I could trust your word.”\n“I stand by what I was forced to do, Brightlord,” Amaram said, stepping\nforward. “The arrival of the Voidbringers only proves I was in the right. We\nneed practiced Shardbearers. The stories of darkeyes gaining Blades are\ncharming, but do you really think we have time for nursery tales now,\ninstead of practical reality?”\n“You murdered defenseless men,” Dalinar said through gritted teeth.\n“Men who had saved your life.”\nAmaram stooped, lifting Oathbringer. “And what of the hundreds, even\nthousands, your wars killed?”\nThey locked gazes.\n“I respect you greatly, Brightlord,” Amaram said. “Your life has been\none of grand accomplishment, and you have spent it seeking the good of\nAlethkar.

Well, it might make you feel better\nabout your past, but morality is not a thing you can simply doff to put on\nthe helm of battle, then put back on when you’re done with the slaughter.”\nHe nodded his head in esteem, as if he hadn’t just rammed a sword\nthrough Dalinar’s gut.\nDalinar spun and left Amaram holding Oathbringer. Dalinar’s stride\ndown the corridors was so quick that his entourage had to scramble to keep\nup.\nHe finally found his rooms. “Leave me,” he said to his guards and the\nbridgemen.\nThey hesitated, storm them. He turned, ready to lash out, but calmed\nhimself. “I don’t intend to stray in the tower alone. I will obey my own\nlaws. Go.”\nThey reluctantly retreated, leaving his door unguarded. He passed into\nhis outer common room, where he’d ordered most of the furniture to be\nplaced. Navani’s heating fabrial glowed in a corner, near a small rug and\nseveral chairs. They finally had enough Stormlight to power it.\nDrawn by the warmth, Dalinar walked up to the fabrial. He was\nsurprised to find Taravangian sitting in one of the chairs, staring into the\ndepths of the shining ruby that radiated heat into the room. Well, Dalinar\nhad invited the king to use this common room when he wished.\nDalinar wanted nothing but to be alone, and he toyed with leaving. He\nwasn’t sure that Taravangian had noticed him. But that warmth was so\nwelcoming. There were few fires in the tower, and even with the walls to\nblock wind, you always felt chilled.\nHe settled into the other chair and let out a deep sigh. Taravangian didn’t\naddress him, bless the man. Together they sat by that not-fire, staring into\nthe depths of the gem.\nStorms, how he had failed today. There would be no coalition. He\ncouldn’t even keep the Alethi highprinces in line.\n“Not quite like sitting by a hearth, is it?” Taravangian finally said, his\nvoice soft.\n“No,” Dalinar agreed. “I miss the popping of the logs, the dancing of\nflamespren.”\n“It does have its own charm though. Subtle. You can see the Stormlight\nmoving inside.”\n“Our own little storm,” Dalinar said. “Captured, contained, and\nchanneled.”\nTaravangian smiled, eyes lit by the ruby’s Stormlight. “Dalinar\nKholin … do you mind me asking you something? How do you know what\nis right?”\n“A lofty question, Your Majesty.”\n“Please, just Taravangian.”\nDalinar nodded.\n“You have denied the Almighty,” Taravangian said.\n“I—”\n“No, no. I am not decrying you as a heretic. I do not care, Dalinar. I’ve\nquestioned the existence of deity myself.”"

I’ve\nquestioned the existence of deity myself.”\n“I feel there must be a God,” Dalinar said softly. “My mind and soul\nrebel at the alternative.”\n“Is it not our duty, as kings, to ask questions that make the minds and\nsouls of other men cringe?”\n“Perhaps,” Dalinar said. He studied Taravangian. The king seemed so\ncontemplative.\nYes, there still is some of the old Taravangian in there, Dalinar thought.\nWe have misjudged him. He might be slow, but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t\nthink.\n“I have felt warmth,” Dalinar said, “coming from a place beyond. A light\nI can almost see. If there is a God, it was not the Almighty, the one who\ncalled himself Honor. He was a creature. Powerful, but still merely a\ncreature.”\n“Then how do you know what is right? What guides you?”\nDalinar leaned forward. He thought he could see something larger within\nthe ruby’s light. Something that moved like a fish in a bowl.\nWarmth continued to bathe him. Light.\n“ ‘On my sixtieth day,’ ” Dalinar whispered, “ ‘I passed a town whose\nname shall remain unspoken. Though still in lands that named me king, I\nwas far enough from my home to go unrecognized. Not even those men\nwho handled my face daily—in the form of my seal imprinted upon their\nletters of authority—would have known this humble traveler as their king.’\n”\nTaravangian looked to him, confused.\n“It’s a quote from a book,” Dalinar said. “A king long ago took a\njourney. His destination was this very city. Urithiru.”\n“Ah…” Taravangian said. “The Way of Kings, is it? Adrotagia has\nmentioned that book.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “ ‘In this town, I found men bedeviled. There had\nbeen a murder. A hogman, tasked in protecting the landlord’s beasts, had\nbeen assaulted. He lived long enough, only, to whisper that three of the\nother hogmen had gathered together and done the crime.\n“ ‘I arrived as questions were being raised, and men interrogated. You\nsee, there were four other hogmen in the landlord’s employ. Three of them\nhad been responsible for the assault, and likely would have escaped\nsuspicion had they finished their grim job. Each of the four loudly\nproclaimed that he was the one who had not been part of the cabal. No\namount of interrogation determined the truth.’ ”\nDalinar fell silent.\n“What happened?” Taravangian asked.\n“He doesn’t say at first,” Dalinar replied. “Throughout his book, he\nraises the question again and again. Three of those men were violent threats,\nguilty of premeditated murder. One was innocent. What do you do?”\n“Hang all four,” Taravangian whispered.\nDalinar—surprised to hear such bloodthirst from the other man—turned.\nTaravangian looked sorrowful, not bloodthirsty at all.\n“The landlord’s job,” Taravangian said, “is to prevent further murders.

It is too neat, too\nsimple a parable. Our lives are far messier. But assuming the story did occur\nas claimed, and there was absolutely no way of determining who was\nguilty … you have to hang all four. Don’t you?”\n“What of the innocent man?”\n“One innocent dead, but three murderers stopped. Is it not the best good\nthat can be done, and the best way to protect your people?” Taravangian\nrubbed his forehead. “Stormfather. I sound like a madman, don’t I? But is it\nnot a particular madness to be charged with such decisions? It’s difficult to\naddress such questions without revealing our own hypocrisy.”\nHypocrite, Amaram accused Dalinar in his mind.\nHe and Gavilar hadn’t used pretty justifications when they’d gone to war.\nThey’d done as men did: they’d conquered. Only later had Gavilar started\nto seek validation for their actions.\n“Why not let them all go?” Dalinar said. “If you can’t prove who is\nguilty—if you can’t be sure—I think you should let them go.”\n“Yes … one innocent in four is too many for you. That makes sense too.”\n“No, any innocent is too many.”\n“You say that,” Taravangian said. “Many people do, but our laws will\nclaim innocent men—for all judges are flawed, as is our knowledge.\nEventually, you will execute someone who does not deserve it. This is the\nburden society must carry in exchange for order.”\n“I hate that,” Dalinar said softly.\n“Yes … I do too. But it’s not a matter of morality, is it? It’s a matter of\nthresholds. How many guilty may be punished before you’d accept one\ninnocent casualty? A thousand? Ten thousand? A hundred? When you\nconsider, all calculations are meaningless except one. Has more good been\ndone than evil? If so, then the law has done its job. And so … I must hang\nall four men.” He paused. “And I would weep, every night, for having done\nit.”\nDamnation. Again, Dalinar reassessed his impression of Taravangian.\nThe king was soft-spoken, but not slow. He was simply a man who liked to\nconsider a great long time before committing.\n“Nohadon eventually wrote,” Dalinar said, “that the landlord took a\nmodest approach. He imprisoned all four. Though the punishment should\nhave been death, he mixed together the guilt and innocence, and determined\nthat the average guilt of the four should deserve only prison.”\n“He was unwilling to commit,” Taravangian said. “He wasn’t seeking\njustice, but to assuage his own conscience.”\n“What he did was, nevertheless, another option.”\n“Does your king ever say what he would have done?” Taravangian\nasked. “The one who wrote the book?”\n“He said the only course was to let the Almighty guide, and let each\ninstance be judged differently, depending on circumstances.”\n“So he too was unwilling to commit,” Taravangian said. “I would have\nexpected more.”"

He didn’t stop at the bedroom, though the hour was growing late,\nand instead made his way onto his balcony. To look out over the clouds.\nTaravangian is wrong, the Stormfather said. You are not a hypocrite, Son\nof Honor.\n“I am,” Dalinar said softly. “But sometimes a hypocrite is nothing more\nthan a person who is in the process of changing.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled. He didn’t like the idea of change.\nDo I go to war with the other kingdoms, Dalinar thought, and maybe\nsave the world? Or do I sit here and pretend that I can do all this on my\nown?\n“Do you have any more visions of Nohadon?” Dalinar asked the\nStormfather, hopeful.\nI have shown you all that was created for you to see, the Stormfather\nsaid. I can show no more.\n“Then I should like to rewatch the vision where I met Nohadon,” Dalinar\nsaid. “Though let me go fetch Navani before you begin. I want her to record\nwhat I say.”\nWould you rather I show the vision to her as well? the Stormfather\nasked. She could record it herself that way.\nDalinar froze. “You can show the visions to others?”\nI was given this leave: to choose those who would best be served by the\nvisions. He paused, then grudgingly continued. To choose a Bondsmith.\nNo, he did not like the idea of being bonded, but it was part of what he’d\nbeen commanded to do.\nDalinar barely considered that thought.\nThe Stormfather could show the visions to others.\n“Anyone?” Dalinar said. “You can show them to anyone?”\nDuring a storm, I can approach anyone I choose, the Stormfather said.\nBut you do not have to be in a storm, so you can join a vision in which I\nhave placed someone else, even if you are distant.\nStorms! Dalinar bellowed a laugh.\nWhat have I done? the Stormfather asked.\n“You’ve just solved my problem!”\nThe problem from The Way of Kings?\n“No, the greater one. I’ve been wishing for a way to meet with the other\nmonarchs in person.” Dalinar grinned. “I think that in a coming highstorm,\nQueen Fen of Thaylenah is going to have a quite remarkable experience.”\n29.

Read, or listen, to someone who has passed between\nrealms.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nVeil prowled through the Breakaway market, hat pulled low, hands in her\npockets. Nobody else seemed to be able to hear the beast that she did.\nRegular shipments of supplies through Jah Keved via King Taravangian\nhad set the market bustling. Fortunately, with a third Radiant capable of\nworking the Oathgate now, less of Shallan’s time was required.\nSpheres that glowed again, and several highstorms as proof that that\nwould persist, had encouraged everyone. Excitement was high, trading\nbrisk. Drink flowed freely from casks emblazoned with the royal seal of Jah\nKeved.\nLurking within it all, somewhere, was a predator that only Veil could\nhear. She heard the thing in the silence between laughter. It was the sound\nof a tunnel extending into the darkness. The feel of breath on the back of\nyour neck in a dark room.\nHow could they laugh while that void watched?\nIt had been a frustrating four days. Dalinar had increased patrols to\nalmost ridiculous levels, but those soldiers weren’t watching the right way.\nThey were too easily seen, too disruptive. Veil had set her men to a more\ntargeted surveillance in the market.\nSo far, they’d found nothing. Her team was tired, as was Shallan, who\nsuffered from the long nights as Veil. Fortunately, Shallan wasn’t doing\nanything particularly useful these days. Sword training with Adolin each\nday—more frolicking and flirting than useful swordplay—and the\noccasional meeting with Dalinar where she had nothing to add but a pretty\nmap.\nVeil though … Veil hunted the hunter. Dalinar acted like a soldier:\nincreased patrols, strict rules. He asked his scribes to find him evidence of\nspren attacking people in historical records.\nHe needed more than vague explanations and abstract ideas—but those\nwere the very soul of art. If you could explain something perfectly, then\nyou’d never need art. That was the difference between a table and a\nbeautiful woodcutting. You could explain the table: its purpose, its shape, its\nnature. The woodcutting you simply had to experience.\nShe ducked into a tent tavern. Did it seem busier in here than on\nprevious nights? Yes. Dalinar’s patrols had people on edge. They were\navoiding the darker, more sinister taverns in favor of ones with good crowds\nand bright lights.\nGaz and Red stood beside a pile of crates, nursing drinks and wearing\nplain trousers and shirts, not uniforms. She hoped they weren’t too\nintoxicated yet. Veil pushed up to their position, crossing her arms on the\nboxes.\n“Nothing yet,” Gaz said with a grunt. “Same as the other nights.”\n“Not that we’re complaining,” Red added, grinning as he took a long\npull on his drink. “This is the kind of soldiering I can really get behind.”\n“It’s going to happen tonight,” Veil said. “I can smell it in the air.”\n“You said that last night, Veil,” Gaz said.\nThree nights ago, a friendly game of cards had turned to violence, and\none player had hit another over the head with a bottle.

        "text": "“You said that last night, Veil,” Gaz said.\nThree nights ago, a friendly game of cards had turned to violence, and\none player had hit another over the head with a bottle. That often wouldn’t\nhave been lethal, but it had hit just right and killed the poor fellow. The\nperpetrator—one of Ruthar’s soldiers—had been hanged the next day in the\nmarket’s central square.\nAs unfortunate as the event had been, it was exactly what she’d been\nwaiting for. A seed. An act of violence, one man striking the other. She’d\nmobilized her team and set them in the taverns near where the fight\noccurred. Watch, she’d said. Someone will get attacked with a bottle, in\nexactly the same way. Pick someone who looks like the man who died, and\nwatch.\nShallan had done sketches of the murdered man, a short fellow with long\ndrooping mustaches. Veil had distributed them; the men took her as no more\nthan another employee.\nNow … they waited.\n“The attack will come,” Veil said. “Who are your targets?”\nRed pointed out two men in the tent who had mustaches and were of a\nsimilar height to the dead man. Veil nodded and dropped a few low-value\nspheres onto the table. “Get something in you other than booze.”\n“Sure, sure,” Red said as Gaz grabbed the spheres. “But tell me,\nsweetness, don’t you want to stay here with us a little longer?”\n“Most men who have made a pass at me end up missing a finger or two,\nRed.”\n“I’d still have plenty left to satisfy you, I promise.”\nShe looked back at him, then started snickering. “That was a decently\ngood line.”\n“Thanks!” He raised his mug. “So…”\n“Sorry, not interested.”\nHe sighed, but raised his mug farther before taking a pull on it.\n“Where did you come from, anyway?” Gaz said, inspecting her with his\nsingle eye.\n“Shallan kind of sucked me up along the way, like a boat pulling flotsam\ninto its wake.”\n“She does that,” Red said. “You think you’re done. Living out the last\nlight of your sphere, you know? And then suddenly, you’re an honor guard\nto a storming Knight Radiant, and everyone’s looking up to you.”\nGaz grunted. “Ain’t that true. Ain’t that true.…”\n“Keep watch,” Veil said. “You know what to do if something happens.”\nThey nodded. They’d send one man to the meeting place, while the other\ntried to tail the attacker. They knew there might be something weird about\nthe man they chased, but she hadn’t told them everything.\nVeil walked back to the meeting point, near a dais at the center of the\nmarket, close to the well. The dais looked like it had once held some kind of\nofficial building, but all that remained was the six-foot-high foundation with\nsteps leading up to it on four sides. Here, Aladar’s officers had set up central\npolicing operations and disciplinary facilities.\nShe watched the crowds while idly spinning her knife in her fingers. Veil\nliked watching people.

It was good to know\nhow the two of them were different, but it was also good to know what they\nhad in common.\nVeil wasn’t a true loner. She needed people. Yes, she scammed them on\noccasion, but she wasn’t a thief. She was a lover of experience. She was at\nher best in a crowded market, watching, thinking, enjoying.\nNow Radiant … Radiant could take people or leave them. They were a\ntool, but also a nuisance. How could they so often act against their own best\ninterests? The world would be a better place if they’d all simply do what\nRadiant said. Barring that, they could at least leave her alone.\nVeil flipped her knife up and caught it. Radiant and Veil shared\nefficiency. They liked seeing things done well, in the right way. They didn’t\nsuffer fools, though Veil could laugh at them, while Radiant simply ignored\nthem.\nScreams sounded in the market.\nFinally, Veil thought, catching her knife and spinning. She came alert,\neager, drawing in Stormlight. Where?\nVathah came barreling through the crowd, shoving aside a marketgoer.\nVeil ran to meet him.\n“Details!” Veil snapped.\n“It wasn’t like you said,” he said. “Follow me.”\nThe two took off back the way he’d come.\n“It wasn’t a bottle to the head.” Vathah said. “My tent is near one of the\nbuildings. The stone ones that were here in the market, you know?”\n“And?” she demanded.\nVathah pointed as they drew close. You couldn’t miss the tall structure\nbeside the tent he and Glurv had been watching. At the top, a corpse\ndangled from an outcropping, hanged by the neck.\nHanged. Storm it. The thing didn’t imitate the attack with the bottle … it\nimitated the execution that followed!\nVathah pointed. “Killer dropped the person up there, leaving them to\ntwitch. Then the killer jumped down. All that distance, Veil. How—”\n“Where?” she demanded.\n“Glurv is tailing,” Vathah said, pointing.\nThe two charged in that direction, shoving their way through the crowds.\nThey eventually spotted Glurv up ahead, standing on the edge of the well,\nwaving. He was a squat man with a face that always looked swollen, as if it\nwere trying to burst through its skin.\n“Man wearing all black,” he said. “Ran straight toward the eastern\ntunnels!” He pointed toward where troubled marketgoers were peering\ndown a tunnel, as if someone had just passed them in a rush.\nVeil dashed in that direction. Vathah stayed with her longer than Glurv—\nbut with Stormlight, she maintained a sprint no ordinary person could\nmatch. She burst into the indicated hallway and demanded to know if\nanyone had seen a man pass this way. A pair of women pointed.\nVeil followed, heart beating violently, Stormlight raging within her. If\nshe failed the chase, she’d have to wait for two more people to be assaulted\n—if it even happened again.

A few last people pointed down a tunnel at her\nshouted question.\nShe was beginning to lose hope as she reached the end of the hallway at\nan intersection, and looked one way, then the other. She glowed brightly to\nlight the corridors for a distance, but she saw nothing in either.\nShe let out a sigh, slumping against the wall.\n“Mmmm…” Pattern said from her coat. “It’s there.”\n“Where?” Shallan asked.\n“To the right. The shadows are off. The wrong pattern.”\nShe stepped forward, and something split out of the shadows, a figure\nthat was jet black—though like a liquid or a polished stone, it reflected her\nlight. It scrambled away, its shape wrong. Not fully human.\nVeil ran, heedless of the danger. This thing might be able to hurt her—\nbut the mystery was the greater threat. She needed to know these secrets.\nShallan skidded around a corner, then barreled down the next tunnel. She\nmanaged to follow the broken piece of shadow, but she couldn’t quite catch\nit.\nThe chase led her deeper into the far reaches of the tower’s ground floor,\nto areas barely explored, where the tunnels grew increasingly confusing.\nThe air smelled of old things. Of dust and stone left alone for ages. The\nstrata danced on the walls, the speed of her run making them seem to twist\naround her like threads in a loom.\nThe thing dropped to all fours, light from Shallan’s glow reflecting off its\ncoal skin. It ran, frantic, until it hit a turn in the tunnel ahead and squeezed\ninto a hole in the wall, two feet wide, near the floor.\nRadiant dropped to her knees, spotting the thing as it wriggled out the\nother side of the hole. Not that thick, she thought, standing. “Pattern!” she\ndemanded, thrusting her hand to the side.\nShe attacked the wall with her Shardblade, slicing chunks free, dropping\nthem to the floor with a clatter. The strata ran all the way through the stone,\nand the pieces she carved off had a forlorn, broken beauty to them.\nEngorged with Light, she shoved up against the sliced wall, finally\nbreaking through into a small room beyond.\nMuch of its floor was taken up by the mouth of a pit. Circled by stone\nsteps with no railing, the hole bored down through the rock into darkness.\nRadiant lowered her Shardblade, letting it slice into the rock at her feet. A\nhole. Like her drawing of spiraling blackness, a pit that seemed to descend\ninto the void itself.\nShe released her Shardblade, falling to her knees.\n“Shallan?” Pattern asked, rising up from the ground near where the\nBlade had vanished.\n“We’ll need to descend.”\n“Now?”\nShe nodded. “But first … first, go and get Adolin. Tell him to bring\nsoldiers.”\nPattern hummed. “You won’t go alone, will you?”\n“No. I promise. Can you make your way back?”\nPattern buzzed affirmatively, then zipped off across the ground, dimpling\nthe floor of the rock. Curiously, the wall near where she’d broken in showed"

Curiously, the wall near where she’d broken in showed\nthe rust marks and remnants of ancient hinges. So there was a secret door to\nget into this place.\nShallan kept her word. She was drawn toward that blackness, but she\nwasn’t stupid. Well, mostly not stupid. She waited, transfixed by the pit,\nuntil she heard voices from the hallway behind her. He can’t see me in Veil’s\nclothing! she thought, and started to reawaken. How long had she been\nkneeling there?\nShe took off Veil’s hat and long white coat, then hid them behind the\ndebris. Stormlight enfolded her, painting the image of a havah over her\ntrousers, gloved hand, and tight buttoned shirt.\nShallan. She was Shallan again—innocent, lively Shallan. Quick with a\nquip, even when nobody wanted to hear it. Earnest, but sometimes\novereager. She could be that person.\nThat’s you, a part of her cried as she adopted the persona. That’s the real\nyou. Isn’t it? Why do you have to paint that face over another?\nShe turned as a short, wiry man in a blue uniform entered the room, grey\ndusting his temples. What was his name again? She’d spent some time\naround Bridge Four in the last few weeks, but still hadn’t learned them all.\nAdolin strode in next, wearing Kholin blue Shardplate, faceplate up,\nBlade resting on his shoulder. Judging from the sounds out in the hallway—\nand the Herdazian faces that peeked into the room—he had brought not\nonly soldiers, but the entirety of Bridge Four.\nThat included Renarin, who clomped in after his brother, clad in slate-\ncolored Shardplate. Renarin looked far less frail when fully armored,\nthough his face didn’t seem like a soldier’s, even if he had stopped wearing\nhis spectacles.\nPattern approached and tried to slide up her illusory dress, but then\nstopped, backing away and humming in pleasure at the lie. “I found him!”\nhe proclaimed. “I found Adolin!”\n“I see that,” Shallan said.\n“He came at me,” Adolin said, “in the training rooms, screaming that\nyou’d found the killer. Said that if I didn’t come, you’d probably—and I\nquote—‘go do something stupid without letting me watch.’ ”\nPattern hummed. “Stupidity. Very interesting.”\n“You should visit the Alethi court sometime,” Adolin said, stepping over\nto the pit. “So…”\n“We tracked the thing that has been assaulting people,” Shallan said. “It\nkilled someone in the market, then it came here.”\n“The … thing?” one of the bridgemen asked. “Not a person?”\n“It’s a spren,” Shallan whispered. “But not like one I’ve ever seen. It’s\nable to imitate a person for a time—but it eventually becomes something\nelse. A broken face, a twisted shape…”\n“Sounds like that girl you’ve been seeing, Skar,” one of the bridgemen\nnoted."

A broken face, a twisted shape…”\n“Sounds like that girl you’ve been seeing, Skar,” one of the bridgemen\nnoted.\n“Ha ha,” Skar said dryly. “How about we toss you in that pit, Eth, and\nsee how far down this thing goes?”\n“So this spren,” Lopen said, approaching the pit, “it, sure, killed\nHighprince Sadeas?”\nShallan hesitated. No. It had killed Perel in copying the Sadeas murder,\nbut someone else had murdered the highprince. She glanced at Adolin, who\nmust have been thinking the same thing, for how solemn his expression\nwas.\nThe spren was the greater threat—it had performed multiple murders.\nStill, it made her uncomfortable to acknowledge that her investigation\nhadn’t taken them a single step closer to finding who had killed the\nhighprince.\n“We must have passed by this point a dozen times,” a soldier said from\nbehind. Shallan started; that voice was female. Indeed, she’d mistaken one\nof Dalinar’s scouts—the short woman with long hair—for another\nbridgeman, though her uniform was different. She was inspecting the cuts\nShallan had made to get into this room. “Don’t you remember scouting\nright past that curved hallway outside, Teft?”\nTeft nodded, rubbing his bearded chin. “Yeah, you’re right, Lyn. But\nwhy hide a room like this?”\n“There’s something down there,” Renarin whispered, leaning out over\nthe pit. “Something … ancient. You’ve felt it, haven’t you?” He looked up\nat Shallan, then the others in the room. “This place is weird; this whole\ntower is weird. You’ve noticed it too, right?”\n“Kid,” Teft said, “you’re the expert on what’s weird. We’ll trust your\nword.”\nShallan looked with concern toward Renarin at the insult. He just\ngrinned, as one of the other bridgemen slapped him on the back—Plate\nnotwithstanding—while Lopen and Rock started arguing over who was\ntruly the weirdest among them. In a moment of surprise, she realized that\nBridge Four had actually assimilated Renarin. He might be the lighteyed\nson of a highprince, resplendent in Shardplate, but here he was just another\nbridgeman.\n“So,” one of the men said, a handsome, muscled fellow with arms that\nseemed too long for his body, “I assume we’re heading down into this awful\ncrypt of terror?”\n“Yes,” Shallan said. She thought his name was Drehy.\n“Storming lovely,” Drehy said. “Marching orders, Teft?”\n“That’s up to Brightlord Adolin.”\n“I brought the best men I could find,” Adolin said to Shallan. “But I feel\nlike I should bring an entire army instead. You sure you want to do this\nnow?”\n“Yes,” Shallan said. “We have to, Adolin. And … I don’t know that an\narmy would make a difference.”\n“Very well. Teft, give us a hefty rearguard. I don’t fancy having\nsomething sneak up on us. Lyn, I want accurate maps—stop us if we get too"

Lyn, I want accurate maps—stop us if we get too\nfar ahead of your drawing. I want to know my exact line of retreat. We go\nslowly, men. Be ready to perform a controlled, careful retreat if I command\nit.”\nSome shuffling of personnel followed. Then the group finally started\ndown the staircase, single file, Shallan and Adolin near the center of the\npack. The steps jutted right from the wall, but were wide enough that people\nwould be able to pass on their way up, so there was no danger of falling off.\nShe tried to keep from brushing anyone, as it might disturb the illusion that\nshe was wearing her dress.\nThe sound of their footsteps vanished into the void. Soon they were\nalone with the timeless, patient darkness. The light of the sphere lanterns\nthe bridgemen carried didn’t seem to stretch far in that pit. It reminded\nShallan of the mausoleum carved into the hill near her manor, where ancient\nDavar family members had been Soulcast to statues.\nHer father’s body hadn’t been placed there. They had lacked the funds to\npay for a Soulcaster—and besides, they’d wanted to pretend he was alive.\nShe and her brothers had burned the body, as the darkeyes did.\nPain …\n“I have to remind you, Brightness,” Teft said from in front of her, “you\ncan’t expect anything … extraordinary from my men. For a bit, some of us\nsucked up light and strutted about like we were Stormblessed. That stopped\nwhen Kaladin left.”\n“It’ll come back, gancho!” Lopen said from behind her. “When Kaladin\nreturns, we’ll glow again good.”\n“Hush, Lopen,” Teft said. “Keep your voice down. Anyway, Brightness,\nthe lads will do their best, but you need to know what—and what not—to\nexpect.”\nShallan hadn’t been expecting Radiant powers from them; she’d known\nabout their limitation already. All she needed were soldiers. Eventually,\nLopen tossed a diamond chip into the hole, earning him a glare from\nAdolin.\n“It might be down there waiting for us,” the prince hissed. “Don’t give it\nwarning.”\nThe bridgeman wilted, but nodded. The sphere bounced as a visible\npinprick below, and Shallan was glad to know that at least there was an end\nto this descent. She’d begun to imagine an infinite spiral, like with old\nDilid, one of the ten fools. He ran up a hillside toward the Tranquiline Halls\nwith sand sliding beneath his feet—running for eternity, but never making\nprogress.\nSeveral bridgemen let out audible sighs of relief as they finally reached\nthe bottom of the shaft. Here, piles of splinters scattered at the edges of the\nround chamber, covered in decayspren. There had once been a banister for\nthe steps, but it had fallen to the effects of time.\nThe bottom of the shaft had only one exit, a large archway more\nelaborate than others in the tower. Up above, almost everything was the\nsame uniform stone—as if this whole tower had been carved in one go."

Up above, almost everything was the\nsame uniform stone—as if this whole tower had been carved in one go.\nHere, the archway was of separately placed stones, and the walls of the\ntunnel beyond were lined with bright mosaic tiles.\nOnce they entered the hall, Shallan gasped, holding up a diamond broam.\nGorgeous, intricate pictures of the Heralds—made of thousands of tiles—\nadorned the ceiling, each in a circular panel.\nThe art on the walls was more enigmatic. A solitary figure hovering\nabove the ground before a large blue disc, arms stretched to the side as if to\nembrace it. Depictions of the Almighty in his traditional form as a cloud\nbursting with energy and light. A woman in the shape of a tree, hands\nspreading toward the sky and becoming branches. Who would have thought\nto find pagan symbols in the home of the Knights Radiant?\nOther murals depicted shapes that reminded her of Pattern, windspren …\nten kinds of spren. One for each order?\nAdolin sent a vanguard a short distance ahead, and soon they returned.\n“Metal doors ahead, Brightlord,” Lyn said. “One on each side of the hall.”\nShallan pried her eyes away from the murals, joining the main body of\nthe force as they moved. They reached the large steel doors and stopped,\nthough the corridor itself continued onward. At Shallan’s prompting, the\nbridgemen tried them, but couldn’t get them open.\n“Locked,” Drehy said, wiping his brow.\nAdolin stepped forward, sword in hand. “I’ve got a key.”\n“Adolin…” Shallan said. “These are artifacts from another time.\nValuable and precious.”\n“I won’t break them too much,” he promised.\n“But—”\n“Aren’t we chasing a murderer?” he said. “Someone who is likely to,\nsay, hide in a locked room?”\nShe sighed, then nodded as he waved everyone back. She tucked her\nsafehand, which had brushed him, back under her arm. It was so strange to\nfeel like she was wearing a glove, but to see her hand as sleeved. Would it\nreally have been so bad to let Adolin know about Veil?\nA part of her panicked at the idea, so she let go of it quickly.\nAdolin rammed his Blade through the door just above where the lock or\nbar would be, then swept it down. Teft tried the door, and was able to shove\nit open, hinges grinding loudly.\nThe bridgemen ducked in first, spears in hand. For all Teft’s insistence\nthat she wasn’t to expect anything exceptional of them, they took point\nwithout orders, even though there were two Shardbearers at the ready.\nAdolin rushed in after the bridgemen to secure the room, though Renarin\nwasn’t paying much attention. He’d walked a few steps farther down the\nmain corridor, and now stood still, staring deeper into the depths, sphere\nheld absently in one gauntleted hand, Shardblade in the other.\nShallan stepped up hesitantly beside him.

She could sense it more distinctly\nnow. Not an evil really, but a wrongness. Like the sight of a wrist hanging\nfrom an arm after the bone is broken.\n“What is it?” Renarin whispered. “Glys is frightened, and won’t speak.”\n“Pattern doesn’t know,” Shallan said. “He calls it ancient. Says it’s of the\nenemy.”\nRenarin nodded.\n“Your father doesn’t seem to be able to feel it,” Shallan said. “Why can\nwe?”\n“I … I don’t know. Maybe—”\n“Shallan?” Adolin said, looking out of the room, his faceplate up. “You\nshould see this.”\nThe wreckage inside the room was more decayed than most they’d found\nin the tower. Rusted clasps and screws clung to bits of wood. Decomposed\nheaps ran in rows, containing bits of fragile covers and spines.\nA library. They’d finally found the books Jasnah had dreamed of\ndiscovering.\nThey were ruined.\nWith a sinking feeling, Shallan moved through the room, nudging at\npiles of dust and splinters with her toes, frightening off decayspren. She\nfound some shapes of books, but they disintegrated at her touch. She knelt\nbetween two rows of fallen books, feeling lost. All that knowledge … dead\nand gone.\n“Sorry,” Adolin said, standing awkwardly nearby.\n“Don’t let the men disturb this. Maybe … maybe there’s something\nNavani’s scholars can do to recover it.”\n“Want us to search the other room?” Adolin asked.\nShe nodded, and he clanked off. A short time later, she heard hinges\ncreak as Adolin forced open the door.\nShallan suddenly felt exhausted. If these books here were gone, then it\nwas unlikely they’d find others better preserved.\nForward. She rose, brushing off her knees, which only reminded her that\nher dress wasn’t real. You aren’t here for this secret anyway.\nShe stepped out into the main hallway, the one with the murals. Adolin\nand the bridgemen were exploring the room on the other side, but a quick\nglance showed Shallan that it was a mirror of the one they’d left, furnished\nonly with piles of debris.\n“Um … guys?” Lyn, the scout, called. “Prince Adolin? Brightness\nRadiant?”\nShallan turned from the room. Renarin had walked farther down the\ncorridor. The scout had followed him, but had frozen in the hallway.\nRenarin’s sphere illuminated something in the distance. A large mass that\nreflected the light, like glistening tar.\n“We shouldn’t have come here,” Renarin said. “We can’t fight this.\nStormfather.” He stumbled backward. “Stormfather…”\nThe bridgemen hastened into the hallway in front of Shallan, between\nher and Renarin. At a barked order from Teft, they made a formation\nspanning from one side of the main hallway to the other: a line of men\nholding spears low, with a second line behind holding more spears higher in\nan overhand grip."

A living darkness.\nThat darkness seeped down the hallway. It wasn’t fast, but there was an\ninevitability about the way it coated everything, flowing up the sides of the\nwalls, onto the ceiling. On the ground, shapes split from the main mass,\nbecoming figures that stepped as if from the surf. Creatures that had two\nfeet and soon grew faces, with clothing that rippled into existence.\n“She’s here,” Renarin whispered. “One of the Unmade. Re-Shephir …\nthe Midnight Mother.”\n“Run, Shallan!” Adolin shouted. “Men, start back up the hall.”\nThen—of course—he charged at the flood of things.\nThe figures … they look like us, Shallan thought, stepping back, farther\nfrom the line of bridgemen. There was one midnight creature that looked\nlike Teft, and another that was a copy of Lopen. Two larger shapes seemed\nto be wearing Shardplate. Except they were made of shiny tar, their features\nblobby, imperfect.\nThe mouths opened, sprouting spiny teeth.\n“Make a careful retreat, like the prince ordered!” Teft called. “Don’t get\nboxed in, men! Hold the line! Renarin!”\nRenarin still stood out in front, holding forth his Shardblade: long and\nthin, with a waving pattern to the metal. Adolin reached his brother, then\ngrabbed his arm and tried to tow him back.\nHe resisted. He seemed mesmerized by that line of forming monsters.\n“Renarin! Attention!” Teft shouted. “To the line!”\nThe boy’s head snapped up at the command and he scrambled—as if he\nweren’t the cousin of the king—to obey his sergeant’s order. Adolin\nretreated with him, and the two fell into formation with the bridgemen.\nTogether, they pulled backward through the main hall.\nShallan backed up, staying roughly twenty feet behind the formation.\nSuddenly, the enemy moved with a burst of speed. Shallan cried out, and\nthe bridgemen cursed, turning spears as the main mass of darkness swept up\nalong the sides of the corridor, covering the beautiful murals.\nThe midnight figures dashed forward, charging the line. An explosive,\nfrantic clash followed, bridgemen holding formation and striking at\ncreatures who suddenly began forming on the right and left, coming out of\nthe blackness on the walls. The things bled vapor when struck, a darkness\nthat hissed from them and dissipated into the air.\nLike smoke, Shallan thought.\nThe tar swept down from the walls, surrounding the bridgemen, who\ncircled to keep themselves from being attacked at the rear. Adolin and\nRenarin fought at the very front, hacking with Blades, leaving dark figures\nto hiss and gush smoke in pieces.\nShallan found herself separated from the soldiers, an inky blackness\nbetween them. There didn’t seem to be a duplicate for her.\nThe midnight faces bristled with teeth. Though they thrust with spears,\nthey did so awkwardly. They struck true now and then, wounding a"

They struck true now and then, wounding a\nbridgeman, who would pull back into the center of the formation to be\nhastily bandaged by Lyn or Lopen. Renarin fell into the center and started to\nglow with Stormlight, healing those who were hurt.\nShallan watched all this, feeling a numbing trance settle over her. “I …\nknow you,” she whispered to the blackness, realizing it was true. “I know\nwhat you’re doing.”\nMen grunted and stabbed. Adolin swept before himself, Shardblade\ntrailing black smoke from the creatures’ wounds. He chopped apart dozens\nof the things, but new ones continued forming, wearing familiar shapes.\nDalinar. Teshav. Highprinces and scouts, soldiers and scribes.\n“You try to imitate us,” Shallan said. “But you fail. You’re a spren. You\ndon’t quite understand.”\nShe stepped toward the surrounded bridgemen.\n“Shallan!” Adolin called, grunting as he cleaved three figures before\nhim. “Escape! Run!”\nShe ignored him, stepping up to the darkness. In front of her—at the\nclosest point of the ring—Drehy stabbed a figure straight through the head,\nsending it stumbling back. Shallan seized its shoulders, spinning it toward\nher. It was Navani, a gaping hole in her face, black smoke escaping with a\nhiss. Even ignoring that, the features were off. The nose too big, one eye a\nlittle higher than the other.\nIt dropped to the floor, writhing as it deflated like a punctured wineskin.\nShallan strode right up to the formation. The things fled her, shying to\nthe sides. Shallan had the distinct and terrifying impression that these things\ncould have swept the bridgemen away at will—overwhelming them in a\nterrible black tide. But the Midnight Mother wanted to learn; she wanted to\nfight with spears.\nIf that was so, however, she was growing impatient. The newer figures\nforming up were increasingly distorted, more bestial, spiny teeth spilling\nfrom their mouths.\n“Your imitation is pathetic,” Shallan whispered. “Here. Let me show you\nhow it’s done.”\nShallan drew in her Stormlight, going alight like a beacon. Things\nscreamed, pulling away from her. As she stepped around the formation of\nworried bridgemen—wading into the blackness at their left flank—figures\nextended from her, shapes growing from light. The people from her recently\nrebuilt collection.\nPalona. Soldiers from the hallways. A group of Soulcasters she’d passed\ntwo days ago. Men and women from the markets. Highprinces and scribes.\nThe man who had tried to pick up Veil at the tavern. The Horneater she’d\nstabbed in the hand. Soldiers. Cobblers. Scouts. Washwomen. Even a few\nkings.\nA glowing, radiant force.\nHer figures spread out to surround the beleaguered bridgemen like\nsentries. This new, glowing force drove the enemy monsters back, and the\ntar withdrew along the sides of the hall, until the path of retreat was open."

This new, glowing force drove the enemy monsters back, and the\ntar withdrew along the sides of the hall, until the path of retreat was open.\nThe Midnight Mother dominated the darkness at the end of the hall, the\ndirection they had not yet explored. It waited there, and did not recede\nfarther.\nThe bridgemen relaxed, Renarin muttering as he healed the last few who\nhad been hurt. Shallan’s cohort of glowing figures moved forward and\nformed a line with her, between darkness and bridgemen.\nThe creatures formed again from the blackness ahead, growing more\nferocious, like beasts. Featureless blobs with teeth sprouting from slit\nmouths.\n“How are you doing this?” Adolin asked, voice ringing from within his\nhelm. “Why are they afraid?”\n“Has someone with a knife—not knowing who you were—ever tried to\nthreaten you?”\n“Yeah. I just summoned my Shardblade.”\n“It’s a little like that.” Shallan stepped forward, and Adolin joined her.\nRenarin summoned his Blade and took a few quick steps to reach them, his\nPlate clicking.\nThe darkness pulled back, revealing that the hallway opened up into a\nroom ahead. As she approached, Shallan’s Stormlight illuminated a bowl-\nlike chamber. The center was dominated by a heaving black mass that\nundulated and pulsed, stretching from floor to ceiling some twenty feet\nabove.\nThe midnight beasts tested forward against her light, no longer seeming\nas intimidated.\n“We have to choose,” Shallan said to Adolin and Renarin. “Retreat or\nattack?”\n“What do you think?”\n“I don’t know. This creature … she’s been watching me. She’s changed\nhow I see the tower. I feel like I understand her, a connection I cannot\nexplain. That can’t be a good thing, right? Can we even trust what I think?”\nAdolin raised his faceplate and smiled at her. Storms, that smile.\n“Highmarshal Halad always said that to beat someone, you must first know\nthem. It’s become one of the rules we follow in warfare.”\n“And … what did he say about retreat?”\n“ ‘Plan every battle as if you will inevitably retreat, but fight every battle\nlike there is no backing down.’ ”\nThe main mass in the chamber undulated, faces appearing from its tarry\nsurface—pressing out as if trying to escape. There was something beneath\nthe enormous spren. Yes, it was wrapped around a pillar that reached from\nthe floor of the circular room to its ceiling.\nThe murals, the intricate art, the fallen troves of information … This\nplace was important.\nShallan clasped her hands before herself, and the Patternblade formed in\nher palms. She twisted it in a sweaty grip, falling into the dueling stance\nAdolin had been teaching her.\nHolding it immediately brought pain. Not the screaming of a dead spren.\nPain inside. The pain of an Ideal sworn, but not yet overcome.\n“Bridgemen,” Adolin called. “You willing to give it another go?”\n“We’ll last longer than you will, gancho! Even with your fancy armor.”\nAdolin grinned and slammed his faceplate down. “At your word,\nRadiant.”\nShe sent her illusions in, but the darkness didn’t shy before them as it\nhad previously.

Dozens of these midnight men clogged the way forward.\n“Clear the way for me to the thing in the center,” she said, trying to\nsound more certain than she felt. “I need to get close enough to touch her.”\n“Renarin, can you guard my back?” Adolin asked.\nRenarin nodded.\nAdolin took a deep breath, then charged into the room, bursting right\nthrough the middle of an illusion of his father. He struck at the first\nmidnight man, chopping it down, then began sweeping around him in a\nfrenzy.\nBridge Four shouted, rushing in behind him. Together, they began to\nform a path for Shallan, slaying the creatures between her and the pillar.\nShe walked through the bridgemen, a rank of them forming a spear line\nto either side of her. Ahead, Adolin pushed toward the pillar, Renarin at his\nback preventing him from being surrounded, bridgemen in turn pushing up\nalong the sides to keep Renarin from being overwhelmed.\nThe monsters no longer bore even a semblance of humanity. They struck\nAdolin, too-real claws and teeth scraping his armor. Others clung to him,\ntrying to weigh him down or find chinks in the Shardplate.\nThey know how to face men like him, Shallan thought, still holding her\nShardblade in one hand. Why then do they fear me?\nShallan wove Light, and a version of Radiant appeared near Renarin.\nThe creatures attacked it, leaving Renarin for a moment—unfortunately,\nmost of her illusions had fallen, collapsing into Stormlight as they were\ndisrupted again and again. She could have kept them going, she thought,\nwith more practice.\nInstead, she wove versions of herself. Young and old, confident and\nfrightened. A dozen different Shallans. With a shock, she realized that\nseveral were pictures she’d lost, self-portraits she’d practiced with a mirror,\nas Dandos the Oilsworn had insisted was vital for an aspiring artist.\nSome of her selves cowered; others fought. For a moment Shallan lost\nherself, and she even let Veil appear among them. She was those women,\nthose girls, every one of them. And none of them were her. They were\nthings she used, manipulated. Illusions.\n“Shallan!” Adolin shouted, voice straining as Renarin grunted and ripped\nmidnight men off him. “Whatever you’re going to do, do it now!”\nShe’d stepped up to the front of the column the soldiers had won for her,\nright near Adolin. She tore her gaze away from a child Shallan dancing\namong the midnight men. Before her, the main mass—coating the pillar in\nthe center of the room—bubbled with faces that stretched against the\nsurface, mouths opening to scream, then submerged like men drowning in\ntar.\n“Shallan!” Adolin said again.\nThat pulsing mass, so terrible, but so captivating.\nThe image of the pit. The twisting lines of the corridors. The tower that\ncouldn’t be completely seen. This was why she’d come."

She pulled off her glove, stepped right up to the mass of tar\nand voiceless screams.\nThen pressed her safehand against it.\n30. Mother of Lies\nListen to the words of a fool.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nShallan was open to this thing. Laid bare, her skin split, her soul gaping\nwide. It could get in.\nIt was also open to her.\nShe felt its confused fascination with humankind. It remembered men—\nan innate understanding, much as newborn mink kits innately knew to fear\nthe skyeel. This spren was not completely aware, not completely cognizant.\nShe was a creation of instinct and alien curiosity, drawn to violence and\npain like scavengers to the scent of blood.\nShallan knew Re-Shephir at the same time as the thing came to know\nher. The spren tugged and prodded at Shallan’s bond with Pattern, seeking\nto rip it free and insert herself instead. Pattern clung to Shallan, and she to\nhim, holding on for dear life.\nShe fears us, Pattern’s voice buzzed in her head. Why does she fear us?\nIn her mind’s eye, Shallan envisioned herself holding tightly to Pattern in\nhis humanoid form, the two of them huddled down before the spren’s\nattack. That image was all she could see at the moment, for the room—and\neverything in it—had dissolved to black.\nThis thing was ancient. Created long ago as a splinter of the soul of\nsomething even more terrible, Re-Shephir had been ordered to sow chaos,\nspawning horrors to confuse and destroy men. Over time, slowly, she’d\nbecome increasingly intrigued by the things she murdered.\nHer creations had come to imitate what she saw in the world, but lacking\nlove or affection. Like stones come alive, content to be killed or to kill with\nno attachment or enjoyment. No emotions beyond an overpowering\ncuriosity, and that ephemeral attraction to violence.\nAlmighty above … it’s like a creationspren. Only so, so wrong.\nPattern whimpered, huddled against Shallan in his shape of a man with a\nstiff robe and a moving pattern for a head. She tried to shield him from the\nonslaught.\nFight every battle … as if there is … no backing down.\nShallan looked into the depths of the swirling void, the dark spinning\nsoul of Re-Shephir, the Midnight Mother. Then, growling, Shallan struck.\nShe didn’t attack like the prim, excitable girl who had been trained by\ncautious Vorin society. She attacked like the frenzied child who had\nmurdered her mother. The cornered woman who had stabbed Tyn through\nthe chest. She drew upon the part of her that hated the way everyone\nassumed she was so nice, so sweet.

She couldn’t tell if it was actually happening—if she was\npushing her physical body farther into the creature’s tar—or if this was all a\nrepresentation of someplace else. A place beyond this room in the tower,\nbeyond even Shadesmar.\nThe creature trembled, and Shallan finally saw the reason for its fear. It\nhad been trapped. The event had happened recently in the spren’s\nreckoning, though Shallan had the impression that in fact centuries upon\ncenturies had passed.\nRe-Shephir was terrified of it happening again. The imprisonment had\nbeen unexpected, presumed impossible. And it had been done by a\nLightweaver like Shallan, who had understood this creature.\nIt feared her like an axehound might fear someone with a voice similar to\nthat of its harsh master.\nShallan hung on, pressing herself against the enemy, but realization\nwashed over her—the understanding that this thing was going to know her\ncompletely, discover each and every one of her secrets.\nHer ferocity and determination wavered; her commitment began to seep\naway.\nSo she lied. She insisted that she wasn’t afraid. She was committed.\nShe’d always been that way. She would continue that way forever.\nPower could be an illusion of perception. Even within yourself.\nRe-Shephir broke. It screeched, a sound that vibrated through Shallan. A\nscreech that remembered its imprisonment and feared something worse.\nShallan dropped backward in the room where they’d been fighting.\nAdolin caught her in a steel grip, going down on one knee with an audible\ncrack of Plate against stone. She heard that echoing scream fading. Not\ndying. Fleeing, escaping, determined to get as far from Shallan as it could.\nWhen she forced her eyes open, she found the room clean of the\ndarkness. The corpses of the midnight creatures had dissolved. Renarin\nquickly knelt next to a bridgeman who had been hurt, removing his gauntlet\nand infusing the man with healing Stormlight.\nAdolin helped Shallan sit up, and she tucked her exposed safehand under\nher other arm. Storms … she’d somehow kept up the illusion of the havah.\nEven after all of that, she didn’t want Adolin to know of Veil. She\ncouldn’t.\n“Where?” she asked him, exhausted. “Where did it go?”\nAdolin pointed toward the other side of the room, where a tunnel\nextended farther down into the depths of the mountain. “It fled in that\ndirection, like moving smoke.”\n“So … should we chase it down?” Eth asked, making his way carefully\ntoward the tunnel. His lantern revealed steps cut into the stone. “This goes\ndown a long ways.”\nShallan could feel a change in the air. The tower was … different. “Don’t\ngive chase,” she said, remembering the terror of that conflict. She was more\nthan happy to let the thing run. “We can post guards in this chamber, but I\ndon’t think she’ll return.”\n“Yeah,” Teft said, leaning on his spear and wiping sweat from his face."

The pillar in the exact center of the\nroom.\nIt was set with thousands upon thousands of cut gemstones, most larger\nthan Shallan’s fist. Together, they were a treasure worth more than most\nkingdoms.\n31. Demands of the Storm\nIf they cannot make you less foolish, at least let them give you hope.\n—From Oathbringer, preface\nThroughout his youth, Kaladin had dreamed of joining the military and\nleaving quiet little Hearthstone. Everyone knew that soldiers traveled\nextensively and saw the world.\nAnd he had. He’d seen dozens upon dozens of empty hills, weed-\ncovered plains, and identical warcamps. Actual sights, though … well, that\nwas another story.\nThe city of Revolar was, as his hike with the parshmen had proven, only\na few weeks away from Hearthstone by foot. He’d never visited. Storms,\nhe’d never actually lived in a city before, unless you counted the warcamps.\nHe suspected most cities weren’t surrounded by an army of parshmen as\nthis one was.\nRevolar was built in a nice hollow on the leeward side of a series of hills,\nthe perfect spot for a little town. Except this was not a “little town.” The\ncity had sprawled out, filling in the areas between the hills, going up the\nleeward slopes—only leaving the tips completely bare.\nHe’d expected a city to look more organized. He’d imagined neat rows\nof houses, like an efficient warcamp. This looked more like a snarl of plants\nclumped in a chasm at the Shattered Plains. Streets running this way and\nthat. Markets that poked out haphazardly.\nKaladin joined his team of parshmen as they wound along a wide\nroadway kept level with smoothed crem. They passed through thousands\nupon thousands of parshmen camped here, and more gathered by the hour,\nit seemed.\nHis, however, was the only group that carried stone-headed spears on\ntheir shoulders, packs of dried grain biscuits, and hogshide leather sandals.\nThey tied their smocks with belts, and carried stone knives, hatchets, and\ntinder in waxed sleeves made from candles he’d traded for. He’d even\nbegun teaching them to use a sling.\nHe probably shouldn’t have shown them any of these things; that didn’t\nstop him from feeling proud as he walked with them, entering the city.\nCrowds thronged the streets. Where had all these parshmen come from?\nThis was a force of at least forty or fifty thousand. He knew most people\nignored parshmen … and, well, he’d done the same. But he’d always had\ntucked into the back of his mind this idea that there weren’t that many out\nthere. Each high-ranking lighteyes owned a handful. And a lot of the\ncaravaneers. And, well, even the less wealthy families from cities or towns"

And there were the dockworkers, the miners, the water haulers,\nthe packmen they used when building large projects.…\n“It’s amazing,” Sah said from where he walked beside Kaladin, carrying\nhis daughter on his shoulder to give her a better view. She clutched some of\nhis wooden cards, holding them close like another child might carry a\nfavorite stuffed doll.\n“Amazing?” Kaladin asked Sah.\n“Our own city, Kal,” he whispered. “During my time as a slave, barely\nable to think, I still dreamed. I tried to imagine what it would be like to have\nmy own home, my own life. Here it is.”\nThe parshmen had obviously moved into homes along the streets here.\nWere they running markets too? It raised a difficult, unsettling question.\nWhere were all the humans? Khen’s group walked deeper into the city, still\nled by the unseen spren. Kaladin spotted signs of trouble. Broken windows.\nDoors that no longer latched. Some of that would be from the Everstorm,\nbut he passed a couple of doors that had obviously been hacked open with\naxes.\nLooting. And ahead stood an inner wall. It was a nice fortification, right\nin the middle of the city sprawl. It probably marked the original city\nboundary, as decided upon by some optimistic architect.\nHere, at long last, Kaladin found signs of the fight he’d expected during\nhis initial trip to Alethkar. The gates to the inner city lay broken. The\nguardhouse had been burned, and arrowheads still stuck from some of the\nwood beams they passed. This was a conquered city.\nBut where had the humans been moved? Should he be looking for a\nprison camp, or a heaping pyre of burned bones? Considering the idea made\nhim sick.\n“Is this what it’s about?” Kaladin said as they walked down a roadway in\nthe inner city. “Is this what you want, Sah? To conquer the kingdom?\nDestroy humankind?”\n“Storms, I don’t know,” he said. “But I can’t be a slave again, Kal. I\nwon’t let them take Vai and imprison her. Would you defend them, after\nwhat they did to you?”\n“They’re my people.”\n“That’s no excuse. If one of ‘your people’ murders another, don’t you put\nthem in prison? What is a just punishment for enslaving my entire race?”\nSyl soared past, her face peeking from a shimmering haze of mist. She\ncaught his eye, then zipped over to a windowsill and settled down, taking\nthe shape of a small rock.\n“I…” Kaladin said. “I don’t know, Sah. But a war to exterminate one\nside or the other can’t be the answer.”\n“You can fight alongside us, Kal. It doesn’t have to be about humans\nagainst parshmen. It can be nobler than that. Oppressed against the\noppressors.”\nAs they passed the place where Syl was, Kaladin swept his hand along\nthe wall. Syl, as they’d practiced, zipped up the sleeve of his coat.

The long curls hid her, they’d determined, well enough.\n“There are a lot of those yellow-white spren here, Kaladin,” she\nwhispered. “Zipping through the air, dancing through buildings.”\n“Any signs of humans?” Kaladin whispered.\n“To the east,” she said. “Crammed into some army barracks and old\nparshman quarters. Others are in big pens, watched under guard. Kaladin …\nthere’s another highstorm coming today.”\n“When?”\n“Soon, maybe? I’m new to guessing this. I doubt anyone is expecting it.\nEverything has been thrown off; the charts will all be wrong until people\ncan make new ones.”\nKaladin hissed slowly through his teeth.\nAhead, his team approached a large group of parshmen. Judging by the\nway they’d been organized into large lines, this was some kind of\nprocessing station for new arrivals. Indeed, Khen’s band of a hundred was\nshuffled into one of the lines to wait.\nAhead of them, a parshman in full carapace armor—like a Parshendi—\nstrolled down the line, holding a writing board. Syl pulled farther into\nKaladin’s hair as the Parshendi man stepped up to Khen’s group.\n“What towns, work camps, or armies do you all come from?” His voice\nhad a strange cadence, similar to the Parshendi Kaladin had heard on the\nShattered Plains. Some of those in Khen’s group had hints of it, but nothing\nthis strong.\nThe scribe parshman wrote down the list of towns Khen gave him, then\nnoted their spears. “You’ve been busy. I’ll recommend you for special\ntraining. Send your captive to the pens; I’ll write down a description here,\nand once you’re settled, you can put him to work.”\n“He…” Khen said, looking at Kaladin. “He is not our captive.” She\nseemed begrudging. “He was one of the humans’ slaves, like us. He wishes\nto join and fight.”\nThe parshman looked up in the air at nothing.\n“Yixli is speaking for you,” Sah whispered to Kaladin. “She sounds\nimpressed.”\n“Well,” the scribe said, “it’s not unheard of, but you’ll have to get\npermission from one of the Fused to label him free.”\n“One of the what?” Khen asked.\nThe parshman with the writing board pointed toward his left. Kaladin\nhad to step out of the line, along with several of the others, to see a tall\nparshwoman with long hair. There was carapace covering her cheeks,\nrunning back along the cheekbones and into her hair. The skin on her arms\nprickled with ridges, as if there were carapace under the skin as well. Her\neyes glowed red.\nKaladin’s breath caught. Bridge Four had described these creatures to\nhim, the strange Parshendi they’d fought during their push toward the center\nof the Shattered Plains. These were the beings who had summoned the\nEverstorm.\nThis one focused directly on Kaladin. There was something oppressive\nabout her red gaze."

There was something oppressive\nabout her red gaze.\nKaladin heard a clap of thunder in the far distance. Around him, many of\nthe parshmen turned toward it and began to mutter. Highstorm.\nIn that moment, Kaladin made his decision. He’d stayed with Sah and\nthe others as long as he dared. He’d learned what he could. The storm\npresented a chance.\nIt’s time to go.\nThe tall, dangerous creature with the red eyes—the Fused, they had\ncalled her—began walking toward Khen’s group. Kaladin couldn’t know if\nshe recognized him as a Radiant, but he had no intention of waiting until\nshe arrived. He’d been planning; the old slave’s instincts had already\ndecided upon the easiest way out.\nIt was on Khen’s belt.\nKaladin sucked in the Stormlight, right from her pouch. He burst alight\nwith its power, then grabbed the pouch—he’d need those gemstones—and\nyanked it free, the leather strap snapping.\n“Get your people to shelter,” Kaladin said to the surprised Khen. “A\nhighstorm is close. Thank you for your kindness. No matter what you are\ntold, know this: I do not wish to be your enemy.”\nThe Fused began to scream with an angry voice. Kaladin met Sah’s\nbetrayed expression, then launched himself into the air.\nFreedom.\nKaladin’s skin shivered with joy. Storms, how he’d missed this. The\nwind, the openness above, even the lurch in his stomach as gravity let go.\nSyl spun around him as a ribbon of light, creating a spiral of glowing lines.\nGloryspren burst up about Kaladin’s head.\nSyl took on the form of a person just so she could glower at the little\nbobbing balls of light. “Mine,” she said, swatting one of them aside.\nAbout five or six hundred feet up, Kaladin changed to a half Lashing, so\nhe slowed and hovered in the sky. Beneath, that red-eyed parshwoman was\ngesturing and screaming, though Kaladin couldn’t hear her. Storms. He\nhoped this wouldn’t mean trouble for Sah and the others.\nHe had an excellent view of the city—the streets filled with figures, now\nmaking for shelter in buildings. Other groups rushed to the city from all\ndirections. Even after spending so much time with them, his first reaction\nwas one of discomfort. So many parshmen together in one place? It was\nunnatural.\nThis impression bothered him now as it never would have before.\nHe eyed the stormwall, which he could see approaching in the far\ndistance. He still had time before it arrived.\nHe’d have to fly up above the storm to avoid being caught in its winds.\nBut then what?\n“Urithiru is out there somewhere, to the west,” Kaladin said. “Can you\nguide us there?”\n“How would I do that?”\n“You’ve been there before.”\n“So have you.”\n“You’re a force of nature, Syl,” Kaladin said. “You can feel the storms.\nDon’t you have some kind of … location sense?”\n“You’re the one from this realm,” she said, batting away another"

Maybe I heard it somewhere once. Or maybe I’m just smart.”\n“We’ll have to make for the Shattered Plains, then,” Kaladin said. “We\ncan strike out for one of the larger cities in southern Alethkar, swap\ngemstones there, and hopefully have enough to hop over to the warcamps.”\nThat decided, he tied his gemstone pouch to his belt, then glanced down\nand tried to make a final estimate of troop numbers and parshman\nfortifications. It felt odd to not worry about the storm, but he’d just move up\nover it once it arrived.\nFrom up here, Kaladin could see the great trenches cut into the stones to\ndivert away floodwaters after a storm. Though most of the parshmen had\nfled for shelter, some remained below, craning necks and staring up at him.\nHe read betrayal in their postures, though he couldn’t even tell if these were\nmembers of Khen’s group or not.\n“What?” Syl asked, alighting on his shoulder.\n“I can’t help but feel a kinship to them, Syl.”\n“They conquered the city. They’re Voidbringers.”\n“No, they’re people. And they’re angry, with good reason.” A gust of\nwind blew across him, making him drift to the side. “I know that feeling. It\nburns in you, worms inside your brain until you forget everything but the\ninjustice done to you. It’s how I felt about Elhokar. Sometimes a world of\nrational explanations can become meaningless in the face of that all-\nconsuming desire to get what you deserve.”\n“You changed your mind about Elhokar, Kaladin. You saw what was\nright.”\n“Did I? Did I find what was right, or did I just finally agree to see things\nthe way you wanted?”\n“Killing Elhokar was wrong.”\n“And the parshmen on the Shattered Plains that I killed? Murdering them\nwasn’t wrong?”\n“You were protecting Dalinar.”\n“Who was assaulting their homeland.”\n“Because they killed his brother.”\n“Which, for all we know, they did because they saw how King Gavilar\nand his people treated the parshmen.” Kaladin turned toward Syl, who sat\non his shoulder, one leg tucked beneath her. “So what’s the difference, Syl?\nWhat is the difference between Dalinar attacking the parshmen, and these\nparshmen conquering that city?”\n“I don’t know,” she said softly.\n“And why was it worse for me to let Elhokar be killed for his injustices\nthan it was for me to actively kill parshmen on the Shattered Plains?”\n“One is wrong. I mean, it just feels wrong. Both do, I guess.”"

Both do, I guess.”\n“Except one nearly broke my bond, while the other didn’t. The bond\nisn’t about what’s right and wrong, is it, Syl. It’s about what you see as right\nand wrong.”\n“What we see,” she corrected. “And about oaths. You swore to protect\nElhokar. Tell me that during your time planning to betray Elhokar, you\ndidn’t—deep down—think you were doing something wrong.”\n“Fine. But it’s still about perception.” Kaladin let the winds blow him,\nfeeling a pit open in his belly. “Storms, I’d hoped … I’d hoped you could\ntell me, give me an absolute right. For once, I’d like my moral code not to\ncome with a list of exceptions at the end.”\nShe nodded thoughtfully.\n“I’d have expected you to object,” Kaladin said. “You’re a … what,\nembodiment of human perceptions of honor? Shouldn’t you at least think\nyou have all the answers?”\n“Probably,” she said. “Or maybe if there are answers, I should be the one\nwho wants to find them.”\nThe stormwall was now fully visible: the great wall of water and refuse\npushed by the oncoming winds of a highstorm. Kaladin had drifted along\nwith the winds away from the city, so he Lashed himself eastward until they\nfloated over the hills that made up the city’s windbreak. Here, he spotted\nsomething he hadn’t seen earlier: pens full of great masses of humans.\nThe winds blowing in from the east were growing stronger. However, the\nparshmen guarding the pens were just standing there, as if nobody had\ngiven them orders to move. The first rumblings of the highstorm had been\ndistant, easy to miss. They’d notice it soon, but that might be too late.\n“Oh!” Syl said. “Kaladin, those people!”\nKaladin cursed, then dropped the Lashing holding him upward, which\nmade him fall in a rush. He crashed to the ground, sending out a puff of\nglowing Stormlight that expanded from him in a ring.\n“Highstorm!” he shouted at the parshman guards. “Highstorm coming!\nGet these people to safety!”\nThey looked at him, dumbfounded. Not a surprising reaction. Kaladin\nsummoned his Blade, shoving past the parshmen and leaping up onto the\npen’s low stone wall, for keeping hogs.\nHe held aloft the Sylblade. Townspeople swarmed to the wall. Cries of\n“Shardbearer” rose.\n“A highstorm is coming!” he shouted, but his voice was quickly lost in\nthe tumult of voices. Storms. He had little doubt that the Voidbringers could\nhandle a group of rioting townsfolk.\nHe sucked in more Stormlight, raising himself into the air. That quieted\nthem, even drove them backward.\n“Where did you shelter,” he demanded in a loud voice, “when the last\nstorms came?”\nA few people near the front pointed at the large bunkers nearby. For\nhousing livestock, parshmen, and even travelers during storms. Could those\nhold an entire town’s worth of people? Maybe if they crowded in."

Could those\nhold an entire town’s worth of people? Maybe if they crowded in.\n“Get moving!” Kaladin said. “A storm will be here soon.”\nKaladin, Syl’s voice said in his mind. Behind you.\nHe turned and found parshman guards approaching his wall with spears.\nKaladin hopped down as the townspeople finally reacted, climbing the\nwalls, which were barely chest high and slathered with smooth, hardened\ncrem.\nKaladin took one step toward the parshmen, then swiped his Blade,\nseparating their spearheads from the hafts. The parshmen—who had barely\nmore training than the ones he’d traveled with—stepped back in confusion.\n“Do you want to fight me?” Kaladin asked them.\nOne shook her head.\n“Then see that those people don’t trample each other in their haste to get\nto safety,” Kaladin said, pointing. “And keep the rest of the guards from\nattacking them. This isn’t a revolt. Can’t you hear the thunder, and feel the\nwind picking up?”\nHe launched himself onto the wall again, then waved for the people to\nmove, shouting orders. The parshman guards eventually decided that\ninstead of fighting a Shardbearer, they’d risk getting into trouble for doing\nwhat he said. Before too long, he had an entire team of them prodding the\nhumans—often less gently than he’d have liked—toward the storm bunkers.\nKaladin dropped down beside one of the guards, a female whose spear\nhe’d sliced in half. “How did this work the last time the storm hit?”\n“We mostly left the humans to themselves,” she admitted. “We were too\nbusy running for safety.”\nSo the Voidbringers hadn’t anticipated that storm’s arrival either. Kaladin\nwinced, trying not to dwell on how many people had likely been lost to the\nimpact of the stormwall.\n“Do better,” he said to her. “These people are your charge now. You’ve\nseized the city, taken what you want. If you wish to claim any kind of moral\nsuperiority, treat your captives better than they did you.”\n“Look,” the parshwoman said. “Who are you? And why—”\nSomething large crashed into Kaladin, tossing him backward into the\nwall with a crunch. The thing had arms; a person who grasped for his\nthroat, trying to strangle him. He kicked them off; their eyes trailed red.\nA blackish-violet glow—like dark Stormlight—rose from the red-eyed\nparshman. Kaladin cursed and Lashed himself into the air.\nThe creature followed.\nAnother rose nearby, leaving a faint violet glow behind, flying as easily\nas he did. These two looked different from the one he’d seen earlier, leaner,\nwith longer hair. Syl cried out in his mind, a sound like pain and surprise\nmixed. He could only assume that someone had run to fetch these, after he\nhad taken to the sky.\nA few windspren zipped past Kaladin, then began to dance playfully\naround him. The sky grew dark, the stormwall thundering across the land.\nThose red-eyed Parshendi chased him upward."

The sky grew dark, the stormwall thundering across the land.\nThose red-eyed Parshendi chased him upward.\nSo Kaladin Lashed himself straight toward the storm.\nIt had worked against the Assassin in White. The highstorm was\ndangerous, but it was also something of an ally. The two creatures followed,\nthough they overshot his elevation and had to Lash themselves back\ndownward in a weird bobbing motion. They reminded him of his first\nexperimentation with his powers.\nKaladin braced himself—holding to the Sylblade, joined by four or five\nwindspren—and crashed through the stormwall. An unstable darkness\nswallowed him; a darkness that was often split by lightning and broken by\nphantom glows. Winds contorted and clashed like rival armies, so irregular\nthat Kaladin was tossed by them one way, then the other. It took all his skill\nin Lashing to simply get going in the right direction.\nHe watched over his shoulder as the two red-eyed parshmen burst in.\nTheir strange glow was more subdued than his own, and somehow gave off\nthe impression of an anti-glow. A darkness that clung to them.\nThey were immediately disrupted, sent spinning in the wind. Kaladin\nsmiled, then was nearly crushed by a boulder tumbling through the air.\nSheer luck saved him; the boulder passed close enough that another few\ninches would have ripped off his arm.\nKaladin Lashed himself upward, soaring through the tempest toward its\nceiling. “Stormfather!” he yelled. “Spren of storms!”\nNo response.\n“Turn yourself aside!” Kaladin shouted into the churning winds. “There\nare people below! Stormfather. You must listen to me!”\nAll grew still.\nKaladin stood in that strange space where he’d seen the Stormfather\nbefore—a place that seemed outside of reality. The ground was far beneath\nhim, dim, slicked with rain, but barren and empty. Kaladin hovered in the\nair. Not Lashed; the air was simply solid beneath him.\nWHO ARE YOU TO MAKE DEMANDS OF THE STORM, SON OF HONOR?\nThe Stormfather was a face as wide as the sky, dominating like a sunrise.\nKaladin held his sword aloft. “I know you for what you are, Stormfather.\nA spren, like Syl.”\nI AM THE MEMORY OF A GOD, THE FRAGMENT THAT REMAINS. THE SOUL OF A\nSTORM AND THE MIND OF ETERNITY.\n“Then surely with that soul, mind, and memory,” Kaladin said, “you can\nfind mercy for the people below.”\nAND WHAT OF THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS WHO HAVE DIED IN THESE WINDS\nBEFORE? SHOULD I HAVE HAD MERCY FOR THEM?\n“Yes.”\nAND THE WAVES THAT SWALLOW, THE FIRES THAT CONSUME? YOU WOULD\nHAVE THEM STOP?\n“I speak only of you, and only today. Please.”\nThunder rumbled. And the Stormfather actually seemed to consider the\nrequest.\nIT IS NOT SOMETHING I CAN DO, SON OF TANAVAST. IF THE WIND STOPS\nBLOWING, IT IS NOT A WIND. IT IS NOTHING.\n“But—”"

IT IS NOTHING.\n“But—”\nKaladin dropped back into the tempest proper, and it seemed as if no\ntime had passed. He ducked through the winds, gritting his teeth in\nfrustration. Windspren accompanied him—he had two dozen now, a\nspinning and laughing group, each a ribbon of light.\nHe passed one of the glowing-eyed parshmen. The Fused? Did that term\nrefer to all whose eyes glowed?\n“The Stormfather really could be more helpful, Syl. Didn’t he claim to\nbe your father?”\nIt’s complicated, she said in his mind. He’s stubborn though. I’m sorry.\n“He’s callous,” Kaladin said.\nHe’s a storm, Kaladin. As people over millennia have imagined him.\n“He could choose.”\nPerhaps. Perhaps not. I think what you’re doing is like asking fire to\nplease stop being so hot.\nKaladin zoomed down along the ground, quickly reaching the hills\naround Revolar. He had hoped to find that everyone was safe, but that was\n—of course—a frail hope. People were scattered across the pens and the\nground near the bunkers. One of those bunkers still had the doors open, and\na few men were trying—bless them—to gather the last people outside and\ncarry them in.\nMany were too far away. They huddled against the ground, holding to\nthe wall or outcroppings of rock. Kaladin could barely make them out in\nflashes of lightning—terrified lumps alone in the tempest.\nHe had felt those winds. He’d been powerless before them, tied to the\nside of a building.\nKaladin … Syl said in his mind as he dropped.\nThe storm pulsed inside him. Within the highstorm, his Stormlight\nconstantly renewed. It preserved him, had saved his life a dozen times over.\nThat very power that had tried to kill him had been his salvation.\nHe hit the ground and dropped Syl, then seized the form of a young\nfather clutching a son. He pulled them up, holding them secure, trying to\nrun them toward the building. Nearby, another person—he couldn’t see\nmuch of them—was torn away in a gust of wind and taken by the darkness.\nKaladin, you can’t save them all.\nHe screamed as he grabbed another person, holding her tight and\nwalking with them. They stumbled in the wind as they reached a cluster of\npeople huddled together. Some two dozen or more, in the shadow of the\nwall around the pens.\nKaladin pulled the three he was helping—the father, the child, the\nwoman—over to the others. “You can’t stay out here!” he shouted at them\nall. “Together. You have to walk together, this way!”\nWith effort—winds howling, rain pelting like daggers—he got the group\nmoving across the stony ground, arm in arm. They made good progress\nuntil a boulder crunched to the ground nearby, sending some of them\nhuddling down in a panic. The wind rose, lifting some people up; only the\nclutching hands of the others kept them from blowing away.\nKaladin blinked away tears that mingled with the rain. He bellowed."

I’m sorry.\n“Being sorry isn’t enough!” he yelled.\nHe clung with one arm to a child, his face toward the storm and its\nterrible winds. Why did it destroy? This tempest shaped them. Must it ruin\nthem too? Consumed by his pain and feelings of betrayal, Kaladin surged\nwith Stormlight and flung his hand forward as if to try to push back the\nwind itself.\nA hundred windspren spun in as lines of light, twisting around his arm,\nwrapping it like ribbons. They surged with Light, then exploded outward in\na blinding sheet, sweeping to Kaladin’s sides and parting the winds around\nhim.\nKaladin stood with his hand toward the tempest, and deflected it. Like a\nstone in a swift-moving river stopped the waters, he opened a pocket in the\nstorm, creating a calm wake behind him.\nThe storm raged against him, but he held the point in a formation of\nwindspren that spread from him like wings, diverting the storm. He\nmanaged to turn his head as the storm battered him. People huddled behind\nhim, soaked, confused—surrounded by calm.\n“Go!” he shouted. “Go!”\nThey found their feet, the young father taking his son back from\nKaladin’s leeward arm. Kaladin backed up with them, maintaining the\nwindbreak. This group was only some of those trapped by the winds, yet it\ntook everything Kaladin had to hold the tempest.\nThe winds seemed angry at him for his defiance. All it would take was\none boulder.\nA figure with glowing red eyes landed on the field before him. It\nadvanced, but the people had finally reached the bunker. Kaladin sighed and\nreleased the winds, and the spren behind him scattered. Exhausted, he let\nthe storm pick him up and fling him away. A quick Lashing gave him\nelevation, preventing him from being rammed into the buildings of the city.\nWow, Syl said in his mind. What did you just do? With the storm?\n“Not enough,” Kaladin whispered.\nYou’ll never be able to do enough to satisfy yourself, Kaladin. That was\nstill wonderful.\nHe was past Revolar in a heartbeat. He turned, becoming merely another\npiece of debris on the winds. The Fused gave chase, but lagged behind, then\nvanished. Kaladin and Syl pushed out of the stormwall, then rode it at the\nfront of the storm. They passed over cities, plains, mountains—never\nrunning out of Stormlight, for there was a source renewing them from\nbehind.\nThey flew for a good hour like that before a current in the winds nudged\nhim toward the south.\n“Go that way,” Syl said, a ribbon of light.\n“Why?”\n“Just listen to the piece of nature incarnate, okay?

It was a strangely shaped stone\nchamber with a loft above—he sometimes put musicians there—and a\nshallow cavity in the floor, which he kept saying he was going to fill with\nwater and fish. She was fairly certain he made claims like that just to annoy\nDalinar with his supposed extravagance.\nFor now, they’d covered the hole with some boards, and Sebarial would\nperiodically warn people not to step on them. The rest of the room was\ndecorated lavishly. She was pretty sure she’d seen those tapestries in a\nmonastery in Dalinar’s warcamp, and they were matched by luxurious\nfurniture, golden lamps, and ceramics.\nAnd a bunch of splintery boards covering a pit. She shook her head.\nThen—curled up on a sofa with blankets heaped over her—she gladly\naccepted a cup of steaming citrus tea from Palona. She still hadn’t been able\nto rid herself of the lingering chill she’d felt since her encounter with Re-\nShephir a few hours back.\n“Is there anything else I can get you?” Palona asked.\nShallan shook her head, so the Herdazian woman settled herself on a\nsofa nearby, holding another cup of tea. Shallan sipped, glad for the\ncompany. Adolin had wanted her to sleep, but the last thing she wanted was\nto be alone. He’d handed her over to Palona’s care, then stayed with Dalinar\nand Navani to answer their further questions.\n“So…” Palona said. “What was it like?”\nHow to answer that? She’d touched the storming Midnight Mother. A\nname from ancient lore, one of the Unmade, princes of the Voidbringers.\nPeople sang about Re-Shephir in poetry and epics, describing her as a dark,\nbeautiful figure. Paintings depicted her as a black-clad woman with red eyes\nand a sultry gaze.\nThat seemed to exemplify how little they really remembered about these\nthings.\n“It wasn’t like the stories,” Shallan whispered. “Re-Shephir is a spren. A\nvast, terrible spren who wants so desperately to understand us. So she kills\nus, imitating our violence.”\nThere was a deeper mystery beyond that, a wisp of something she’d\nglimpsed while intertwined with Re-Shephir. It made Shallan wonder if this\nspren wasn’t merely trying to understand humankind, but rather searching\nfor something it itself had lost.\nHad this creature—in distant, distant time beyond memory—once been\nhuman?\nThey didn’t know.

At Shallan’s first report,\nNavani had set her scholars searching for information, but their access to\nbooks here was still limited. Even with access to the Palanaeum, Shallan\nwasn’t optimistic. Jasnah had hunted for years to find Urithiru, and even\nthen most of what she’d discovered had been unreliable. It had simply been\ntoo many years.\n“To think it was here, all this time,” Palona said. “Hiding down there.”\n“She was captive,” Shallan whispered. “She eventually escaped, but that\nwas centuries ago. She has been waiting here ever since.”\n“Well, we should find where the others are held, and make sure they\ndon’t get out.”\n“I don’t know if the others were ever captured.” She’d felt isolation and\nloneliness from Re-Shephir, a sense of being torn away while the others\nescaped.\n“So…”\n“They’re out there, and always have been,” Shallan said. She felt\nexhausted, and her eyes were drooping in direct defiance of her insistence to\nAdolin that she was not that kind of tired.\n“Surely we’d have discovered them by now.”\n“I don’t know,” Shallan said. “They’ll … they’ll just be normal to us.\nThe way things have always been.”\nShe yawned, then nodded absently as Palona continued talking, her\ncomments degenerating into praise of Shallan for acting as she had. Adolin\nhad been the same way, which she hadn’t minded, and Dalinar had been\ndownright nice to her—instead of being his usual stern rock of a human\nbeing.\nShe didn’t tell them how near she’d come to breaking, and how terrified\nshe was that she might someday meet that creature again.\nBut … maybe she did deserve some acclaim. She’d been a child when\nshe’d left her home, seeking salvation for her family. For the first time since\nthat day on the ship, watching Jah Keved fade behind her, she felt like she\nactually might have a handle on all of this. Like she might have found some\nstability in her life, some control over herself and her surroundings.\nRemarkably, she kind of felt like an adult.\nShe smiled and snuggled into her blankets, drinking her tea and—for the\nmoment—putting out of her mind that basically an entire troop of soldiers\nhad seen her with her glove off. She was kind of an adult. She could deal\nwith a little embarrassment. In fact, she was increasingly certain that\nbetween Shallan, Veil, and Radiant, she could deal with anything life could\nthrow at her.\nA disturbance outside made her sit up, though it didn’t sound dangerous.\nSome chatter, a few boisterous exclamations. She wasn’t terribly surprised\nwhen Adolin stepped in, bowed to Palona—he did have nice manners—and\njogged over to her, his uniform still rumpled from having worn Shardplate\nover it.\n“Don’t panic,” he said. “It’s a good thing.”\n“It?” she said, growing alarmed.\n“Well, someone just arrived at the tower.”\n“Oh, that.

Puuli\nPuuli the lighthouse keeper tried not to let everyone know how excited he\nwas for this new storm.\nIt was truly tragic. Truly tragic. He told Sakin this as she wept. She had\nthought herself quite high and blessed when she’d landed her new husband.\nShe’d moved into the man’s fine stone hut in a prime spot for growing a\ngarden, behind the northern cliffs of the town.\nPuuli gathered scraps of wood blown eastward by the strange storm, and\npiled them in his little cart. He pulled it with two hands, leaving Sakin to\nweep for her husband. Up to three now, she was, all lost at sea. Truly tragic.\nStill, he was excited for the storm.\nHe pulled his cart past other broken homes here, where they should have\nbeen sheltered west of the cliffs. Puuli’s grandfather had been able to\nremember when those cliffs hadn’t been there. Kelek himself had broken\napart the land in the middle of a storm, making a new prime spot for homes.\nWhere would the rich people put their houses now?\nAnd they did have rich people here in town, never mind what the\ntravelers on the ocean said. Those would stop at this little port, on the\ncrumbling eastern edge of Roshar, and shelter from storms in their cove\nalongside the cliffs.\nPuuli pulled his cart past the cove. Here, one of the foreigner captains—\nwith long eyebrows and tan skin, rather than the proper blue skin—was\ntrying to make sense of her ruined ship. It had been rocked in the cove,\nstruck by lightning, then smashed back against the stones. Now only the\nmast was visible.\nTruly tragic, Puuli said. He complimented the captain on the mast\nthough. It was a very nice mast.\nPuuli picked up a few planks from the broken ship that had washed onto\nthe shore of the cove, then threw them into his cart. Even if it had destroyed\nmany a ship, Puuli was happy for this new storm. Secretly happy.\nHad the time finally come, that his grandfather had warned of? The time\nof changes, when the men from the hidden island of the Origin at last came\nto reclaim Natanatan?\nEven if not, this new storm brought him so much wood. Scraps of\nrockbuds, branches from trees. He gathered it all eagerly, piling his cart\nhigh, then pulled it past fishers in huddles, trying to decide how they’d\nsurvive in a world with storms from both directions. Fishers didn’t sleep\naway the Weeping, like lazy farmers. They worked it, for there were no\nwinds. Lots of bailing, but no winds.

That was his name for the lighthouse.\nNobody else called it that, because to them it was just the lighthouse.\nAt the top, he left out an offering of fruit for Kelek, the Herald who lived\nin the storm. Then he pulled his wagon into the room on the bottom floor.\nDefiance wasn’t a tall lighthouse. He’d seen paintings of the sleek,\nfashionable ones down along Longbrow’s Straits. Lighthouses for rich folks\nwho sailed ships that didn’t catch fish. Defiance was only two stories tall,\nand built squat like a bunker. But she had good stonework, and a buffer of\ncrem on the outside kept her from leaking.\nShe’d stood for over a hundred years, and Kelek hadn’t decided to knock\nher down. The Stormfather knew how important she was. Puuli carried a\nload of wet stormwood and broken boards up to the top of the lighthouse,\nwhere he set them out beside the fire—which burned low during the day—\nto dry. He dusted off his hands, then stepped up to the rim of the lighthouse.\nAt night, the mirrors would shine the light right out through this hole.\nHe looked over the cliffs, to the east. His family was a lot like the\nlighthouse themselves. Squat, short, but powerful. And enduring.\nThey’ll come with Light in their pockets, Grandfather had said. They’ll\ncome to destroy, but you should watch for them anyway. Because they’ll\ncome from the Origin. The sailors lost on an infinite sea. You keep that fire\nhigh at night, Puuli. You burn it bright until the day they come.\nThey’ll arrive when the night is darkest.\nSurely that was now, with a new storm. Darkest nights. A tragedy.\nAnd a sign.\nI-2. Ellista\nThe Jokasha Monastery was ordinarily a very quiet place. Nestled in the\nforests on the western slopes of the Horneater Peaks, the monastery felt\nonly rain at the passing of a highstorm. Furious rain, yes, but none of the\nterrible violence known in most parts of the world.\nEllista reminded herself every passing storm how lucky she was.

One of your data points, so highly touted, is\nfrom the original passing of the storm, which happened as an uncommon\nevent.”\nEllista slammed her book closed and stuffed it into her satchel. She burst\nfrom her reading nook and gave a glare to the two ardents arguing in the\nhall outside, both wearing the caps of master scholars. They were so\ninvolved in their shouting match that they didn’t even respond to the glare,\nthough it had been one of her best.\nShe bustled from the library, entering a long hallway with sides open to\nthe elements. Peaceful trees. A quiet brook. Humid air and mossy vines that\npopped and stretched as they lay out for the evening. Well, yes, a large\nswath of trees out there had been flattened by the new storm. But that was\nno reason for everyone to get upset! The rest of the world could worry.\nHere, at the central home of the Devotary of the Mind, she was supposed to\nbe able to just read.\nShe set her things out at a reading desk near an open window. The\nhumidity wasn’t good for books, but weak storms went hand-in-hand with\nfecundity. You simply had to accept that. Hopefully those new fabrials to\ndraw water from the air would—\n“… Telling you, we’re going to have to move!” a new voice echoed\nthrough the hallway. “Look, the storm is going to ravage those woods.\nBefore long, this slope will be barren, and the storm will be hitting us full\nforce.”\n“The new storm doesn’t have that strong a wind factor, Bettam. It’s not\ngoing to blow down the trees. Have you looked at my measurements?”\n“I’ve disputed those measurements.”\n“But—”\nEllista rubbed her temples. She wore her head shaved, like the other\nardents. Her parents still joked that she’d joined the ardentia simply because\nshe hated bothering with her hair. She tried earplugs, but could hear the\narguing through them, so she packed up her things again.\nMaybe the low building? She took the long set of steps outside, traveling\ndown the slope along a forested path. Before arriving at the monastery for\nthe first time, she’d had illusions about what it would be like to live among\nscholars. No bickering. No politicking. She hadn’t found that to be true—\nbut generally people left her alone. And so she was lucky to be here. She\ntold herself that again as she entered the lower building.\nIt was basically a zoo. Dozens of people gathering information from\nspanreeds, talking to one another, buzzing with talk of this or that\nhighprince or king. She stopped in the doorway, took it all in for a moment,\nthen turned on her heel and stalked back out.\nNow what? She started back up the steps, but slowed. It’s probably the\nonly route to peace … she thought, looking out into the forest.\nTrying not to think about the dirt, the cremlings, and the fact that\nsomething might drip on her head, she strode off into the forest. She didn’t\nwant to go too far, as who knew what might be out here? She chose a stump\nwithout too much moss on it and settled down among bobbing lifespren,"

She opened\nher book, intent on finally getting something done today.\nWema spun away from Brightlord Sterling’s forward advances, tucking her safehand to\nher breast and lowering her gaze from his comely locks. Such affection as to excite the\nunsavory mind could surely not satisfy her for an extended period, as though his\nattentions had at one time been fanciful delights to entertain her leisure hours, they\nnow seemed to manifest his utmost impudence and greatest faults of character.\n“What!” Ellista exclaimed, reading. “No, you silly girl! He’s finally\npronounced his affection for you. Don’t you dare turn away now.”\nHow could she accept this wanton justification of her once single-minded desires?\nShould she not, instead, select the more prudent choice, as advocated by the\nundeviating will of her uncle? Brightlord Vadam had an endowment of land upon the\nhighprince’s grace, and would have means to provide far beyond the satisfactions\navailable to a simple officer, no matter how well regarded or what winds had graced his\ntemperament, features, and gentle touch.\nEllista gasped. “Brightlord Vadam? You little whore! Have you forgotten\nhow he locked away your father?”\n“Wema,” Brightlord Sterling intoned, “it seems I have gravely misjudged your attentions.\nIn this, I find myself deposited deep within an embarrassment of folly. I shall be away, to\nthe Shattered Plains, and you shall not again suffer the torment of my presence.”\nHe bowed a true gentleman’s bow, possessed of all proper refinement and\ndeference. It was a supplication beyond what even a monarch could rightly demand,\nand in it Wema ascertained the true nature of Brightlord Sterling’s regard. Simple, yet\npassionate. Respectful in deed. It lent great context to his earlier advance, which now\nappeared all at once to be a righteous division in otherwise sure armor, a window of\nvulnerability, rather than a model of avarice.\nAs he lifted the door’s latch to forever make his exodus from her life, Wema surged\nwith unrivaled shame and longing, twisted together not unlike two threads winding in a\nloom to construct a grand tapestry of desire.\n“Wait!” Wema cried. “Dear Sterling, wait upon my words.”\n“Storms right you’d better wait, Sterling.” Ellista leaned closer to the\nbook, flipping the page.\nDecorum seemed a vain thing to her now, lost upon the sea that was her need to feel\nSterling’s touch. She rushed to him, and upon his arm pressed her ensleeved hand,\nwhich then she lifted to caress his sturdy jaw.\nIt was so warm out here in the forest. Practically sweltering. Ellista put\nher hand to her lips, reading with wide eyes, trembling.\nWould that the window through that statuesque armor could still be located, and that a\nsimilar wound within herself might be found, to press against his own and offer passage\ndeep within her soul.

Ardent Urv.” The young Siln ardent was tall,\ngangly, and obnoxiously loud at times. Except, apparently, when sneaking\nup on colleagues in the forest.\n“What was that you were studying?” he asked.\n“Important works,” Ellista said, then sat on the book. “Nothing to mind\nyourself with. What is it you want?”\n“Um…” He looked down at her satchel. “You were the last one to check\nout the transcriptions from Bendthel’s collected Dawnchant? The old\nversions? I just wanted to check on your progress.”\nDawnchant. Right. They’d been working on that before this storm came,\nand everyone got distracted. Old Navani Kholin, in Alethkar, had somehow\ncracked the Dawnchant. Her story about visions was nonsense—the Kholin\nfamily was known for opaque politics—but her key was authentic, and had\nlet them slowly work through the old texts.\nEllista started digging in her satchel. She came up with three musty\ncodices and a sheaf of papers, the latter being the work she’d done so far.\nAnnoyingly, Urv settled on the ground beside her stump, taking the\npapers as she offered them. He laid his satchel across his lap and began\nreading.\n“Incredible,” he said a few moments later. “You’ve made more progress\nthan I have.”\n“Everyone else is too busy worrying about that storm.”\n“Well, it is threatening to wipe out civilization.”\n“An overreaction. Everyone always overreacts to every little gust of\nwind.”\nHe flipped through her pages. “What’s this section? Why take such care\nfor where each text was found? Fiksin concluded that these Dawnchant\nbooks had all spread from a central location, and so there’s nothing to learn\nby where they ended up.”\n“Fiksin was a boot-licker, not a scholar,” Ellista said. “Look, there’s easy\nproof here that the same writing system was once used all across Roshar. I\nhave references in Makabakam, Sela Tales, Alethela … Not a diaspora of\ntexts, but real evidence they wrote naturally in the Dawnchant.”\n“Do you suppose they all spoke the same language?”\n“Hardly.”\n“But Jasnah Kholin’s Relic and Monument?”\n“Doesn’t claim everyone spoke the same language, only that they wrote\nit. It’s foolish to assume that everyone used the same language across\nhundreds of years and dozens of nations. It makes more sense that there was\na codified written language, the language of scholarship, just like you’ll find\nmany undertexts written in Alethi now.”\n“Ah…” he said. “And then a Desolation hit.…”\nEllista nodded, showing him a later page in her sheaf of notes. “This in-\nbetween, weird language is where people started using the Dawnchant\nscript to phonetically transcribe their language.

How could\npeople forget how to read their own language? Well, it seems clear now. By\nthe point this happened, the language had been moribund for millennia.\nThey weren’t speaking it, and hadn’t been for generations.”\n“Brilliant,” Urv said. He wasn’t so bad, for a Siln. “I’ve been translating\nwhat I can, but got stuck on the Covad Fragment. If what you’ve been doing\nhere is correct, it might be because Covad isn’t true Dawnchant, but a\nphonetic transcription of another ancient language.…”\nHe glanced to the side, then cocked his head. Was he looking at her—\nOh, no. It was just the book, which she was still sitting on.\n“An Accountability of Virtue.” He grunted. “Good book.”\n“You’ve read it?”\n“I have a fondness for Alethi epics,” he said absently, flipping through\nher pages. “She really should have picked Vadam though. Sterling was a\nflatterer and a cadger.”\n“Sterling is a noble and upright officer!” She narrowed her eyes. “And\nyou are just trying to get a rise out of me, Ardent Urv.”\n“Maybe.” He flipped through her pages, studying a diagram she’d made\nof various Dawnchant grammars. “I have a copy of the sequel.”\n“There’s a sequel?”\n“About her sister.”\n“The mousy one?”\n“She is elevated to courtly attention and has to choose between a\nstrapping naval officer, a Thaylen banker, and the King’s Wit.”\n“Wait. There are three different men this time?”\n“Sequels always have to be bigger,” he said, then offered her the stack of\npages back. “I’ll lend it to you.”\n“Oh you will, will you?

During the summoning of\nthe Everstorm, a human soldier had struck her directly across the face.

Every one of her people could hear the rhythms—beats\nwith some tones attached—yet she no longer heard the old, common ones.\nOnly these new, superior rhythms.\nBeneath her the chasm opened, where water from highstorms had carved\na bulge. She eventually reached the bottom, and the others dropped around\nher, each landing with a thumping crunch. Ulim moved down the stone\nwall; the spren usually took the form of rolling lightning, moving across\nsurfaces.\nAt the bottom, he formed from lightning into a human shape with odd\neyes. Ulim settled on a patch of broken branches, arms folded, his long hair\nrippling in an unseen wind. She wasn’t certain why a spren sent by Odium\nhimself would look human.\n“Around here somewhere,” Ulim said, pointing. “Spread out and\nsearch.”\nVenli set her jaw, humming to the Rhythm of Fury. Lines of power\nrippled up her arms. “Why should I continue to obey your orders, spren?\nYou should obey me.”\nThe spren ignored her, which further stoked her anger. Demid, however,\nplaced his hand on her shoulder and squeezed, humming to the Rhythm of\nSatisfaction. “Come, look with me this way.”\nShe curtailed her humming and turned south, joining Demid, picking her\nway through debris. Crem buildup had smoothed the floor of the chasm, but\nthe storm had left a great deal of refuse.\nShe attuned the Rhythm of Craving. A quick, violent rhythm. “I should\nbe in charge, Demid. Not that spren.”\n“You are in charge.”\n“Then why haven’t we been told anything? Our gods have returned, yet\nwe’ve barely seen them. We sacrificed greatly for these forms, and to create\nthe glorious true storm. We … we lost how many?”\nSometimes she thought about that, in strange moments when the new\nrhythms seemed to retreat. All of her work, meeting with Ulim in secret,\nguiding her people toward stormform. It had been about saving her people,\nhadn’t it? Yet of the tens of thousands of listeners who had fought to\nsummon the storm, only a fraction remained.\nDemid and she had been scholars. Yet even scholars had gone to battle.\nShe felt at the wound on her face.\n“Our sacrifice was worthwhile,” Demid told her to the Rhythm of\nDerision. “Yes, we have lost many, but humans sought our extinction. At\nleast this way some of our people survived, and now we have great power!”\nHe was right. And, if she was being honest, a form of power was what\nshe had always wanted. And she’d achieved one, capturing a spren in the\nstorm within herself. That hadn’t been one of Ulim’s species, of course—\nlesser spren were used for changing forms. She could occasionally feel the\npulsing, deep within, of the one she’d bonded.\nIn any case, this transformation had given her great power. The good of\nher people had always been secondary to Venli; now was a late time to be\nhaving a bout of conscience."

The good of\nher people had always been secondary to Venli; now was a late time to be\nhaving a bout of conscience.\nShe resumed humming to Craving. Demid smiled and gripped her\nshoulder again. They’d shared something once, during their days in\nmateform. Those silly, distracting passions were not ones they currently felt,\nnor were they something that any sane listener would desire. But the\nmemories of them did create a bond.\nThey picked through the refuse, passing several fresh human corpses,\nsmashed into a cleft in the rock. Good to see those. Good to remember that\nher people had killed many, despite their losses.\n“Venli!” Demid said. “Look!” He scrambled over a log from a large\nwooden bridge that was wedged in the center of the chasm. She followed,\npleased by her strength. She would probably always remember Demid as\nthe gangly scholar he had been before this change, but she doubted either of\nthem would ever willingly return. Forms of power were simply too\nintoxicating.\nOnce across the log, she could see what Demid had spotted: a figure\nslumped by the wall of the chasm, helmeted head bowed. A Shardblade—\nshaped like frozen flames—rose from the ground beside her, rammed into\nthe stone floor.\n“Eshonai! Finally!” Venli leaped from the top of the log, landing near\nDemid.\nEshonai looked exhausted. In fact, she wasn’t moving.\n“Eshonai?” Venli said, kneeling beside her sister. “Are you well?\nEshonai?” She gripped the Plated figure by the shoulders and lightly shook\nit.\nThe head rolled on its neck, limp.\nVenli felt cold. Demid solemnly lifted Eshonai’s faceplate, revealing\ndead eyes set in an ashen face.\nEshonai … no …\n“Ah,” Ulim’s voice said. “Excellent.” The spren approached across the\nstone wall, like crackling lightning moving through the stone. “Demid, your\nhand.”\nDemid obediently raised his hand, palm up, and Ulim shot across from\nthe wall to the hand, then formed into his human shape, standing on the\nperch. “Hmmm. Plate looks completely drained. Broken along the back, I\nsee. Well, it’s said to regrow on its own, even now that it is separated from\nits master from so long ago.”\n“The … Plate,” Venli said softly, numb. “You wanted the Plate.”\n“Well, the Blade too, of course. Why else would we be hunting a corpse?\nYou … Oh, you thought she was alive?”\n“When you said we needed to find my sister,” Venli said, “I thought…”\n“Yes, looks like she drowned in the storm’s floodwaters,” Ulim said,\nmaking a sound like a tongue clicking. “Rammed the sword into the stone,\nheld on to it to stay in place, but couldn’t breathe.”\nVenli attuned the Rhythm of the Lost.\nIt was one of the old, inferior rhythms. She hadn’t been able to find those\nsince transforming, and she had no idea how she happened upon this one.\nThe mournful, solemn tone felt distant to her."

Leave the dead to peace instead; it was their way.\nVenli stared into Eshonai’s dead eyes. You were the voice of reason,\nVenli thought. You were the one who argued with me.

It’s for the best that this one died.”\n“For the best?” Venli said. “For the best?” She stood, confronting the\nlittle spren on Demid’s outstretched palm. “That is my sister. She is one of\nour greatest warriors. An inspiration, and a martyr.”\nUlim rolled his head in an exaggerated way, as if perturbed—and bored\n—by the chastisement. How dare he! He was merely a spren. He was to be\nher servant.\n“Your sister,” Ulim said, “didn’t undergo the transformation properly.\nShe resisted, and we’d have eventually lost her. She was never dedicated to\nour cause.”\nVenli attuned the Rhythm of Fury, speaking in a loud, punctuating\nsequence. “You will not say such things. You are spren! You are to serve.”\n“And I do.”\n“Then you must obey me!”\n“You?” Ulim laughed. “Child, how long have you been fighting your\nlittle war against the humans? Three, four years?”\n“Six years, spren,” Demid said. “Six long, bloody years.”\n“Well, do you want to guess how long we’ve been fighting this war?”\nUlim asked. “Go ahead. Guess. I’m waiting.”\nVenli seethed. “It doesn’t matter—”\n“Oh, but it does,” Ulim said, his red figure electrifying. “Do you know\nhow to lead armies, Venli? True armies? Supply troops across a battlefront\nthat spans hundreds of miles? Do you have memories and experiences that\nspan eons?”\nShe glared at him.\n“Our leaders,” Ulim said, “know exactly what they’re doing. Them I\nobey. But I am the one who escaped, the spren of redemption. I don’t have\nto listen to you.”\n“I will be a queen,” Venli said to Spite.\n“If you survive? Maybe. But your sister? She and the others sent that\nassassin to kill the human king specifically to keep us from returning. Your\npeople are traitors—though your personal efforts do you justice, Venli. You\nmay be blessed further, if you are wise. Regardless, get that armor off your\nsister, shed your tears, and get ready to climb back up. These plateaus are\ncrawling with men who stink of Honor.

I\ndon’t have to worry about you getting in the way. I can do what I want.”\nThat terrified her.\nShe turned to go, but paused as she saw something. What was that small\nspren that had crept out from beneath Eshonai’s corpse? It looked like a\nsmall ball of white fire; it gave off little rings of light and trailed a streak\nbehind it. Like a comet.\n“What are you?” Venli demanded to Spite. “Shoo.”\nShe hiked off, leaving her sister’s corpse there at the bottom of the\nchasm, stripped and alone.

All she’d done was grope an\neldritch spren. Still, she spent the next day holed up in her room sketching\nand thinking.\nJasnah’s return sparked something in her. Shallan had once been more\nanalytical in her drawing, including notes and explanations with the\nsketches. Lately she’d only been doing pages and pages of twisted images.\nWell, she’d been trained as a scholar, hadn’t she? She shouldn’t just\ndraw; she should analyze, extrapolate, speculate. So, she addressed herself\nto fully recording her experiences with the Unmade.\nAdolin and Palona visited her separately, and even Dalinar came to\ncheck on her while Navani clicked her tongue and asked after her health.\nShallan endured their company, then eagerly returned to her drawing. There\nwere so many questions. Why exactly had she been able to drive the thing\naway? What was the meaning of its creations?\nHanging over her research, however, was a single daunting fact.

Though\nNavani mentioned Jasnah was planning to visit her later in the evening,\nShallan washed and dressed, then threw her satchel over her shoulder and\nwent searching for the woman. She had to know how Jasnah had survived.\nIn fact, as Shallan stalked the hallways of Urithiru, she found herself\nincreasingly perturbed. Jasnah claimed to always look at things from a\nlogical perspective, but she had a flair for the dramatic to rival any\nstoryteller. Shallan well remembered that night in Kharbranth when Jasnah\nhad lured thieves in, then dealt with them in stunning—and brutal—fashion.\nJasnah didn’t want to merely prove her points. She wanted to drive them\nright into your skull, with a flourish and a pithy epigram. Why hadn’t she\nwritten via spanreed to let everyone know she had survived? Storms, where\nhad she been all this time?\nA few inquiries led Shallan back to the pit with its spiraling stairs.\nGuards in sharp Kholin blue confirmed that Jasnah was below, so Shallan\nstarted trudging down those steps again, and was surprised to find that she\nfelt no anxiety at the descent. In fact … the oppressive feelings she’d felt\nsince they’d arrived at the tower seemed to have evaporated. No more fear,\nno more formless sense of wrongness. The thing she’d chased away had\nbeen its cause. Somehow, its aura had pervaded the entire tower.\nAt the base of the stairs, she found more soldiers. Dalinar obviously\nwanted this place well guarded; she certainly couldn’t complain about that.\nThese let her pass without incident, save a bow and a murmur of\n“Brightness Radiant.”\nShe strode down the muraled hallway, the sphere lanterns set along the\nbase of the walls making it pleasingly bright. Once she’d passed the empty\nlibrary rooms to either side, she heard voices drifting toward her from\nahead. She stepped up into the room where she’d faced the Midnight\nMother, and got her first good look at the place when it wasn’t covered in\nwrithing darkness.\nThe crystal pillar at the center really was something incredible. It wasn’t\na single gemstone, but a myriad of them fused together: emerald, ruby,\ntopaz, sapphire … All ten varieties seemed to have been melted into a single\nthick pillar, twenty feet tall. Storms … what would it look like if all those\ngems were somehow infused, rather than dun as they were at the moment?\nA large group of guards stood at a barricade near the other side of the\nroom, looking down into the tunnel where the Unmade had vanished.\nJasnah rounded the giant pillar, freehand resting on the crystal. The princess\nwore red, lips painted to match, hair up and run through with swordlike\nhairspikes with rubies on the pommels.\nStorms. She was perfect. A curvaceous figure, tan Alethi skin, light violet\neyes, and not a hint of aberrant color to her jet-black hair. Making Jasnah\nKholin as beautiful as she was brilliant was one of the most unfair things\nthe Almighty had ever done."

Insecure, overwhelmed, and—if she\nwas honest—incredibly envious. Whatever ordeals Jasnah had been\nthrough, she looked no worse for wear. That was remarkable, considering\nthat the last time Shallan had seen Jasnah, the woman had been lying\nunconscious on the floor while a man rammed a knife through her chest.\n“My mother,” Jasnah said, hand still on the pillar, not looking toward\nShallan, “thinks this must be some kind of incredibly intricate fabrial.

They’re\nspren, transformed by the bond.”\n“As are fabrials, after a manner of speaking,” Jasnah said. “You do know\nhow they’re made, don’t you?”\n“Only vaguely,” Shallan said. This was how their reunion went? A\nlecture? Fitting.\n“You capture a spren,” Jasnah said, “and imprison it inside a gemstone\ncrafted for the purpose. Artifabrians have found that specific stimuli will\nprovoke certain responses in the spren. For example, flamespren give off\nheat—and by pressing metal against a ruby with a flamespren trapped\ninside, you can increase or decrease that heat.”\n“That’s…”\n“Incredible?”\n“Horrible,” Shallan said. She’d known some of this, but to contemplate\nit directly appalled her. “Brightness, we’re imprisoning spren?”\n“No worse than hitching a wagon to a chull.”\n“Sure, if in order to get a chull to pull a wagon, you first had to lock it in\na box forever.”\nPattern hummed softly from her skirts in agreement.\nJasnah just cocked an eyebrow. “There are spren and there are spren,\nchild.” She rested her fingers on the pillar again. “Do a sketch of this for\nme. Be certain to get the proportions and colors right, if you please.”\nThe careless presumption of the command hit Shallan like a slap in the\nface. What was she, some servant to be given orders?\nYes, a part of her affirmed. That’s exactly what you are. You’re Jasnah’s\nward. The request wasn’t at all unusual in that light, but compared to how\nshe had grown accustomed to being treated, it was …\nWell, it wasn’t worth taking offense at, and she should accept that.\nStorms, when had she grown so touchy? She took out her sketchpad and got\nto work.\n“I was heartened to hear that you had made it here on your own,” Jasnah\nsaid. “I … apologize for what happened on Wind’s Pleasure. My lack of\nforesight caused the deaths of many, and doubtless hardship for you,\nShallan. Please accept my regret.”\nShallan shrugged, sketching."

Please accept my regret.”\nShallan shrugged, sketching.\n“You’ve done very well,” Jasnah continued. “Imagine my amazement\nwhen I reached the Shattered Plains, only to discover that the warcamp had\nalready relocated to this tower. What you have accomplished is brilliant,\nchild. We will need to speak further, however, about the group that again\ntried to assassinate me. The Ghostbloods will almost certainly start targeting\nyou, now that you’ve begun progressing toward your final Ideals.”\n“You’re sure it was the Ghostbloods that attacked the ship?”\n“Of course I am.” She glanced at Shallan, lips turning down. “Are you\ncertain you are well enough to be about, child? You seem\nuncharacteristically reserved.”\n“I’m fine.”\n“You’re displeased because of the secrets I kept.”\n“We all need secrets, Brightness. I know this more than anyone. But it\nwould have been nice if you had let us know you were alive.” Here I was\nassuming I could handle things on my own—assuming I’d have to handle\nthings on my own. But all that time, you were on your way back to toss\neverything into the air again.\n“I only had the opportunity upon reaching the warcamps,” Jasnah said,\n“and there decided that I couldn’t risk it. I was tired and unprotected. If the\nGhostbloods wished to finish me off, they could have done so at their\nleisure. I determined that a few more days of everyone believing I was dead\nwould not greatly increase their distress.”\n“But how did you even survive in the first place?”\n“Child, I’m an Elsecaller.”\n“Of course. An Elsecaller, Brightness. A thing you never explained; a\nword which no one but the most dedicated scholar of the esoteric would\nrecognize! That explains it perfectly.”\nJasnah smiled for some reason.\n“All Radiants have an attachment to Shadesmar,” Jasnah said. “Our\nspren originate there, and our bond ties us to them. But my order has special\ncontrol over moving between realms. I was able to shift to Shadesmar to\nescape my would-be assassins.”\n“And that helped with the knife in your storming chest?”\n“No,” Jasnah said. “But surely by now you’ve learned the value of a\nlittle Stormlight when it comes to bodily wounds?”\nOf course she had, and she could probably have guessed all of this. But\nfor some reason she didn’t want to accept that. She wanted to remain\nannoyed at Jasnah.\n“My true difficulty was not escaping, but returning,” Jasnah said. “My\npowers make it easy to transfer to Shadesmar, but getting back to this realm\nis no small feat. I had to find a transfer point—a place where Shadesmar\nand our realm touch—which is far, far more difficult than one might\nassume. It’s like … going downhill one way, but uphill to get back.”\nWell, perhaps her return would take some pressure off Shallan. Jasnah\ncould be “Brightness Radiant” and Shallan could be … well, whatever she\nwas.\n“We will need to converse further,” Jasnah said. “I would hear the exact\nstory, from your perspective, of the discovery of Urithiru. And I assume you"

And I assume you\nhave sketches of the transformed parshmen? That will tell us much. I …\nbelieve I once disparaged the usefulness of your artistic skill. I now find\nreason to call myself foolish for that presumption.”\n“It’s fine, Brightness,” Shallan said with a sigh, still sketching the pillar.\n“I can get you those things, and there is a lot to talk about.” But how much\nof it would she be able to say? How would Jasnah react, for instance, to\nfinding that Shallan had been dealing with the Ghostbloods?\nIt’s not like you’re really a part of their organization, Shallan thought to\nherself. If anything, you’re using them for information. Jasnah might find\nthat admirable.\nShallan still wasn’t eager to broach the topic.\n“I feel lost…” Jasnah said.\nShallan looked up from her sketchbook to find the woman regarding the\npillar again, speaking softly, as if to herself.\n“For years I was at the very forefront of all this,” Jasnah said. “One short\nstumble, and I find myself scrambling to stay afloat. These visions that my\nuncle is having … the refounding of the Radiants in my absence …\n“That Windrunner. What do you think of him, Shallan? I find him much\nas I imagined his order, but I have only met him once. It has all come so\nquickly. After years of struggling in the shadows, everything coming to\nlight—and despite my years of study—I understand so very little.”\nShallan continued her sketch. It was nice to be reminded that, for all\ntheir differences, there were occasional things that she and Jasnah shared.\nShe just wished that ignorance weren’t at the top of the list.\n34. Resistance\nI noticed its arrival immediately, just as I noticed your many intrusions\ninto my land.\nIt is time, the Stormfather said.\nAll went dark around Dalinar, and he entered a place between his world\nand the visions. A place with a black sky and an infinite floor of bone-white\nrock. Shapes made of smoke seeped through the stone ground, then rose\naround him, dissipating. Common things. A chair, a vase, a rockbud.\nSometimes people.\nI HAVE HER. The Stormfather’s voice shook this place, eternal and vast.\nTHE THAYLEN QUEEN. MY STORM HITS HER CITY NOW.\n“Good,” Dalinar said. “Please give her the vision.”\nFen was to see the vision with the Knights Radiant falling from the sky,\ncome to deliver a small village from a strange and monstrous force. Dalinar\nwanted her to see the Knights Radiant firsthand, as they had once been.\nRighteous, protecting.\nWHERE SHALL I PUT HER? the Stormfather asked.\n“The same place you put me my first time,” Dalinar said. “In the home.\nWith the family.”\nAND YOU?\n“I’ll observe, then talk to her after.”\nYOU MUST BE PART OF EVENTS, the Stormfather said, sounding stubborn.\nYOU MUST TAKE THE ROLE OF SOMEONE.

But if possible, make Fen see me as myself, and let\nme see her.” He felt at the side sword he wore at his belt. “And can you let\nme keep this? I’d rather not have to fight with a poker again.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled in annoyance, but did not object. The place of\nendless white stone faded.\n“What was that place?” Dalinar asked.\nIT IS NO PLACE.\n“But everything else in these visions is real,” Dalinar said. “So why is it\nthat—”\nIT IS NO PLACE, the Stormfather insisted firmly.\nDalinar fell silent, letting himself be taken by the vision.\nI IMAGINED IT, the Stormfather said more softly, as if he were admitting\nsomething embarrassing. ALL THINGS HAVE A SOUL. A VASE, A WALL, A CHAIR.\nAND WHEN A VASE IS BROKEN, IT MIGHT DIE IN THE PHYSICAL REALM, BUT FOR A\nTIME ITS SOUL REMEMBERS WHAT IT WAS. SO ALL THINGS DIE TWICE. ITS FINAL\nDEATH IS WHEN MEN FORGET IT WAS A VASE, AND THINK ONLY OF THE PIECES. I\nIMAGINE THE VASE FLOATING AWAY THEN, ITS FORM DISSOLVING INTO THE\nNOTHINGNESS.\nDalinar had never heard anything so philosophical from the Stormfather.\nHe hadn’t imagined it was possible that a spren—even a mighty one of the\nhighstorms—could dream in such a way.\nDalinar found himself hurtling through the air.\nFlailing his arms, he shouted in panic. First moon’s violet light bathed\nthe ground far below. His stomach lurched and his clothes flapped in the\nwind. He continued yelling until he realized that he wasn’t actually getting\ncloser to the ground.\nHe wasn’t falling, he was flying. The air was rushing against the top of\nhis head, not his face. Indeed, now he saw that his body was glowing,\nStormlight streaming off him. He didn’t feel like he was holding it though\n—no raging inside his veins, no urge to action.\nHe shielded his face from the wind and looked forward. A Radiant flew\nahead, resplendent in blue armor that glowed, the light brightest at the edges\nand in the grooves. The man was looking back at Dalinar, doubtless because\nof his cries.\nDalinar saluted him to indicate he was all right. The armored man\nnodded, looking forward again.\nHe’s a Windrunner, Dalinar thought, piecing it together. I’ve taken the\nplace of his companion, a female Radiant. He’d seen these two in the vision\nbefore; they were flying to save the village. Dalinar wasn’t moving under\nhis own power—the Windrunner had Lashed the female Radiant into the\nsky, as Szeth had done to Dalinar during the Battle of Narak.\nIt was still difficult to accept that he wasn’t falling, and a sinking feeling\npersisted in the pit of his stomach. He tried to focus on other things. He was\nwearing an unfamiliar brown uniform, though he was glad to note that he\nhad his side sword as requested. But why didn’t he have on Shardplate?

Was this the result\nof the Stormfather trying to make him look like himself to Fen?\nDalinar still didn’t know why Radiant Plate glowed, while modern\nShardplate did not. Was the ancient Plate “living” somehow, like Radiant\nBlades lived?\nPerhaps he could find out from that Radiant ahead. He had to ask his\nquestions carefully, however. Everyone would see Dalinar as the Radiant he\nhad replaced, and if his questions were uncharacteristic, that tended only to\nconfuse people, rather than get him answers.\n“How far away are we?” Dalinar asked. The sound was lost in the wind,\nso he shouted it more loudly, drawing the attention of his companion.\n“Not long now,” the man shouted back, voice echoing inside his helm,\nwhich glowed blue—most strongly at the edges and across the eye slit.\n“I think something might be wrong with my armor!” Dalinar shouted to\nhim. “I can’t make my helm retract!”\nIn response, the other Radiant made his vanish. Dalinar caught sight of a\npuff of Light or mist.\nBeneath the helm, the man had dark skin and curly black hair. His eyes\nglowed blue. “Retract your helm?” he shouted. “You haven’t summoned\nyour armor yet; you had to dismiss it so I could Lash you.”\nOh, Dalinar thought. “I mean earlier. It wouldn’t vanish when I wanted it\nto.”\n“Talk to Harkaylain then, or to your spren.” The Windrunner frowned.\n“Will this be a problem for our mission?”\n“I don’t know,” Dalinar shouted. “But it distracted me. Tell me again\nhow we know where to go, and what we know of the things we’re going to\nfight?” He winced at how awkward that sounded.\n“Just be ready to back me up against the Midnight Essence, and use\nRegrowth on any wounded.”\n“But—”\nYou will find difficulty getting useful answers, Son of Honor, the\nStormfather rumbled. These do not have souls or minds. They are re-\ncreations forged by Honor’s will, and do not have the memories of the real\npeople.\n“Surely we can learn things,” Dalinar said under his breath.\nThey were created to convey only certain ideas. Further pressing will\nmerely reveal the thinness of the facade.\nThis brought up memories of the fake city Dalinar had visited in his first\nvision, the destroyed version of Kholinar that was more prop than reality.\nBut there had to be things he could learn, things that Honor might not have\nintended, but had included by chance.\nI need to get Navani and Jasnah in here, he thought. Let them pick at\nthese re-creations.\nLast time in this vision, Dalinar had taken the place of a man named\nHeb: a husband and father who had defended his family with only a\nfireplace poker for a weapon. He remembered his frantic struggle with a\nbeast of oily, midnight skin. He had fought, bled, agonized. He’d spent what\nseemed like an eternity trying—and eventually failing—to protect his wife\nand daughter."

        "text": "beast of oily, midnight skin. He had fought, bled, agonized. He’d spent what\nseemed like an eternity trying—and eventually failing—to protect his wife\nand daughter.\nSuch a personal memory. False though it was, he had lived it. In fact,\nseeing the small town ahead—in the lait created by a large ridge of rock—\nmade emotions well up inside Dalinar. It was a painful irony that he should\nhave such vivid feelings about this place, these people, when his memories\nof Evi were still so shadowy and confused.\nThe Windrunner slowed Dalinar by grabbing his arm. They drew to a\nstop in midair, hovering above the rocky flats outside the village.\n“There.” The Windrunner pointed to the field around the town, where\nweird black creatures were swarming. About the size of an axehound, they\nhad oily skin that reflected the moonlight. While they moved on all sixes,\nthey were like no natural animal. They had spindly legs like a crab’s, but a\nbulbous body and a sinuous head, featureless except for a slit of a mouth\nbristling with black teeth.\nShallan had faced the source of these things deep beneath Urithiru.\nDalinar had slept a little less secure each night since, knowing that one of\nthe Unmade had been hidden in the bowels of the tower. Were the other\neight similarly lurking nearby?\n“I’ll go down first,” the Windrunner said, “and draw their attention. You\nmake for the town and help the people there.” The man pressed his hand\nagainst Dalinar. “You’ll drop in about thirty seconds.”\nThe man’s helm materialized, then he plunged toward the monsters.\nDalinar remembered that descent from the vision—like a falling star come\nto rescue Dalinar and the family.\n“How,” Dalinar whispered to the Stormfather. “How do we get the\narmor?”\nSpeak the Words.\n“Which words?”\nYou will know or you will not.\nGreat.\nDalinar saw no sign of Taffa or Seeli—the family he’d protected—\nbelow. In his version they’d been out here, but their flight had been his\ndoing. He couldn’t be sure how the vision had played out this time.\nStorms. He hadn’t planned this very well, had he? In his mind’s eye,\nhe’d anticipated getting to Queen Fen and helping her along, making sure\nshe wasn’t in too much danger. Instead, he’d wasted time flying here.\nStupid. He needed to learn to be more specific with the Stormfather.\nDalinar began to descend in a controlled float. He had some idea of how\nthe Windrunner Surges worked together, but he was impressed nonetheless.\nJust as he touched down, the feeling of lightness left him and the Stormlight\nrising from his skin puffed away. This left him as much less of a target in\nthe darkness than the other Radiant, who glowed like a brilliant blue\nbeacon, sweeping about himself with a grand Shardblade as he fought the\nMidnight Essence.\nDalinar crept through the town, his common side sword feeling frail\ncompared to a Shardblade—but at least it wasn’t an iron poker. Some of the\ncreatures scrambled by on the main thoroughfare, but Dalinar hid beside a\nboulder until they passed.\nHe easily identified the proper house, which had a small barn out back,"

He crept up, and\nfound that the barn wall had been ripped open. He remembered hiding in\nthere with Seeli, then fleeing as a monster attacked.\nThe barn was empty, so he headed for the house, which was much finer.\nMade of crem bricks, and larger, though it seemed only one family lived in\nit. For a house this big, that would be an oddity, wouldn’t it? Space was at a\npremium in laits.\nSome of his assumptions obviously didn’t hold in this era. In Alethkar, a\nfine wooden mansion would be a symbol of wealth. Here, however, many of\nthe other houses were of wood.\nDalinar slipped into the house, feeling increasingly worried. Fen’s real\nbody couldn’t be harmed by what happened in the vision, but she could still\nfeel pain. So while the injuries might not be real, her anger at Dalinar\ncertainly would be. He could ruin any chance of her listening to him.\nShe’s already given up on listening, he assured himself. Navani agreed—\nthis vision couldn’t make things worse.\nHe felt in his uniform’s pocket, and was pleased to find some gemstones.\nA Radiant would have Stormlight. He took out a small diamond the size of\na pebble and used its white light to inspect the room. The table had been\noverturned, chairs scattered. The door hung open and creaked softly in a\nbreeze.\nThere was no sign of Queen Fen, but Taffa’s body lay facedown near the\nhearth. She wore a single-piece brown dress, now in tatters. Dalinar sighed,\nsheathing his sword and kneeling to gently touch her back in a spot unraked\nby monster claws.\nIt’s not real, he told himself, not now. This woman lived and died\nthousands of years ago.\nIt still hurt to see her. He walked to the swinging door and stepped\noutside into the night, where howls and cries rang out from the town.\nHe strode quickly down the roadway, feeling a sense of urgency. No …\nnot just urgency, impatience. Seeing Taffa’s corpse had changed something.\nHe was not a confused man trapped in a nightmare, as he’d feared when\nfirst visiting this place. Why was he sneaking? These visions belonged to\nhim. He should not fear their contents.\nOne of the creatures scuttled out of the shadows. Dalinar drew in\nStormlight as it leaped and bit at his leg. Pain flared up his side, but he\nignored it, and the wound reknit. He glanced down as the creature lunged\nagain, with similar lack of results. It scurried backward a few paces, and he\ncould sense confusion in its posture. This was not how its prey was\nsupposed to act.\n“You don’t eat the corpses,” Dalinar said to it. “You kill for pleasure,\ndon’t you? I often think of how spren and man are so different, but this we\nshare. We can both murder.”\nThe unholy thing came at him again, and Dalinar seized it in both hands."

We can both murder.”\nThe unholy thing came at him again, and Dalinar seized it in both hands.\nThe body felt springy to the touch, like a wineskin filled to bursting. He\npainted the writhing monster with Stormlight and spun, hurling it toward a\nnearby building. The creature hit the wall back-first and stuck there several\nfeet above the ground, legs scrambling.\nDalinar continued on his way. He simply cut through the next two\ncreatures that came for him. Their disjointed bodies twitched, black smoke\nleaking from the carcasses.\nWhat is that light? It danced in the night ahead, growing stronger. Harsh,\norange, flooding the end of the street.\nHe didn’t remember a fire from before. Were homes burning? Dalinar\napproached, and found a bonfire, flickering with flamespren, built of\nfurniture. It was surrounded by dozens of people holding brooms and crude\npicks: men and women alike, armed with whatever they could find. Even an\niron poker or two.\nJudging by the fearspren gathered around them, the townspeople were\nterrified. They managed some semblance of ranks anyway—with children at\nthe center, nearer the fires—as they frantically defended themselves from\nthe midnight monsters. A figure near the fire commanded from the top of a\nbox. Fen’s voice had no accent; to Dalinar, her shouts seemed to be in\nperfect Alethi, though—in the strange way of these visions—everyone\npresent was actually speaking and thinking in an ancient language.\nHow did she manage this so quickly? Dalinar wondered, mesmerized by\nthe fighting townsfolk. Some of them fell in bloody, screaming heaps, but\nothers pinned down the monsters and stabbed open their backs—sometimes\nwith kitchen knives—to deflate them.\nDalinar remained on the outskirts of the battle until a dramatic figure in\nglowing blue swept down upon the scene. The Windrunner made short work\nof the remaining creatures.\nAt the end, he saved a glare for Dalinar. “What are you doing standing\nthere? Why haven’t you helped?”\n“I—”\n“We’ll have words about this when we return!” he shouted, pointing\ntoward one of the fallen. “Go, help the wounded!”\nDalinar followed the gesture, but walked toward Fen instead of the\nwounded. Some of the townspeople huddled and wept, though others\nexulted in survival, cheering and holding up their improvised weapons.\nHe’d seen these aftereffects of a battle before. The welling up of emotions\ncame in a variety of ways.\nThe bonfire’s heat caused Dalinar’s brow to sweat. Smoke churned in the\nair, reminding him of the place he’d been before he’d fully entered this\nvision. He’d always loved the warmth of an actual fire, dancing with\nflamespren, so eager to burn themselves out and die.\nFen was over a foot shorter than Dalinar, with an oval face, yellow eyes,\nand white Thaylen eyebrows she kept curled to hang down beside her\ncheeks. She did not braid her grey hair like an Alethi woman would have,\nbut instead let it fall down to cover her shoulders.

Or … slowed greatly. The bonfire’s flames\nshimmered lethargically, and the people slowed to a crawl.\nDalinar was unaffected, as was Fen. He sat down on a box beside the one\nFen stood on, and she hesitantly settled down next to him. “A very strange\ndream.”\n“I assumed I was dreaming myself, when I saw the first vision,” Dalinar\nsaid. “When they kept happening, I was forced to acknowledge that no\ndream is this crisp, this logical. In no dream could we be having this\nconversation.”\n“In every dream I’ve experienced, what happened felt natural at the\ntime.”\n“Then you will know the difference when you wake. I can show many\nmore of these visions to you, Fen. They were left for us by … a being with\nsome interest in helping us survive the Desolations.” Best not to get into his\nheresy at the moment. “If one isn’t persuasive enough, I understand. I’m\ndense enough that I didn’t trust them for months.”\n“Are they all this … invigorating?”\nDalinar smiled. “This was the most powerful of them, to me.” He looked\nto her. “You did better than I did. I worried only about Taffa and her\ndaughter, but just ended up getting them surrounded by monsters anyway.”\n“I let the woman die,” Fen said softly. “I ran with the child, and let the\nthing kill her. Used her almost as bait.” She looked to Dalinar, eyes haunted.\n“What was your purpose in this, Kholin? You imply you have power over\nthese visions. Why did you trap me in this one?”\n“Honestly, I just wanted to talk to you.”\n“Send me a storming letter.”\n“In person, Fen.” He nodded toward the gathered townspeople. “You did\nthis. You organized the town, pitted them against the enemy. It’s\nremarkable! You expect me to accept that you will turn your back on the\nworld in a similar moment of need?”\n“Don’t be dense. My kingdom is suffering. I’m seeing to my people’s\nneeds; I’m not turning my back on anyone.”\nDalinar looked to her and pursed his lips, but said nothing.\n“Fine,” she snapped. “Fine, Kholin. You want to dig into it for real? Tell\nme this. You really expect me to believe that the storming Knights Radiant\nare back and that the Almighty chose you—a tyrant and a murderer—to lead\nthem?”\nIn response, Dalinar stood up and drew in Stormlight.

Incredible though it seems, the Radiants have\nreturned.”\n“And of the second part? Yes, there is a new storm, and perhaps new\nmanifestations of power. Fine. What I don’t accept is that you, Dalinar\nKholin, have been told by the Almighty to lead us.”\n“I have been commanded to unite.”\n“A mandate from God—the very same argument the Hierocracy used for\nseizing control of the government. What about Sadees, the Sunmaker? He\nclaimed he had a calling from the Almighty too.” She stood and walked\namong the people of the town—who stood as if frozen, barely moving. She\nturned and swept a hand back toward Dalinar. “Now here you are, saying\nthe same things in the same way—not quite threats, but insistent. Let us join\nforces! If we don’t, the world is doomed.”\nDalinar felt his patience slipping. He clenched his jaw, forced himself to\nbe calm, and rose. “Your Majesty, you’re being irrational.”\n“Am I? Oh, let me storming reconsider, then. All I need to do is let the\nstorming Blackthorn himself into my city, so he can take control of my\narmies!”\n“What would you have me do?” Dalinar shouted. “Would you have me\nwatch the world crumble?”\nShe cocked her head at his outburst.\n“Maybe you’re right, and I am a tyrant! Maybe letting my armies into\nyour city is a terrible risk. But maybe you don’t have good options! Maybe\nall the good men are dead, so all you have is me! Spitting into the storm\nisn’t going to change that, Fen. You can risk possibly being conquered by\nthe Alethi, or you can definitely fall to the Voidbringer assault alone!”\nCuriously, Fen crossed her arms and raised her left hand to her chin,\ninspecting Dalinar. She didn’t seem the least bit fazed by his shouting.\nDalinar stepped past a squat man who was slowly—as if through tar—\nturning toward where they’d once been seated. “Fen,” Dalinar said. “You\ndon’t like me. Fine. You tell me to my face that trusting me is worse than a\nDesolation.”\nShe studied him, aged eyes thoughtful. What was wrong? What had he\nsaid?\n“Fen,” he tried again. “I—”\n“Where was this passion earlier?” she asked. “Why didn’t you speak like\nthis in your letters to me?”\n“I … Fen, I was being diplomatic.”\nShe sniffed. “That made it sound like I was talking to a committee. It’s\nwhat one always assumes anyway, when communicating via spanreed.”\n“So?”\n“So compared to that, it’s good to hear some honest shouting.” She eyed\nthe people standing around them. “And this is exceptionally creepy. Can we\nget away from this?”\nDalinar found himself nodding, mostly to buy some time to think. Fen\nseemed to think his anger was … a good thing? He gestured at a path\nthrough the crowd and Fen joined him, walking away from the bonfire."

He gestured at a path\nthrough the crowd and Fen joined him, walking away from the bonfire.\n“Fen,” he said, “you say you expected to talk to a committee through the\nspanreed. What’s wrong with that? Why would you want me to shout at you\ninstead?”\n“I don’t want you to shout at me, Kholin,” she said. “But storms, man.\nDon’t you know what has been said about you these last few months?”\n“No.”\n“You’ve been the hottest topic on the spanreed informant networks!\nDalinar Kholin, the Blackthorn, has gone mad! He claims to have killed the\nAlmighty! One day he refuses to fight, then the next day he marches his\narmies off on an insane quest into the Shattered Plains. He says he’s going\nto enslave the Voidbringers!”\n“I didn’t say—”\n“Nobody expects every report to be true, Dalinar, but I had extremely\ngood information claiming you’d lost your mind. Refounding the Knights\nRadiant? Raving about a Desolation? You seized the throne of Alethkar in\nall but title, but refused to fight the other highprinces, and instead ran your\narmies off into the Weeping. Then you told everyone a new storm was\ncoming. That was enough to convince me that you really were mad.”\n“But then the storm came,” Dalinar said.\n“But then the storm came.”\nThe two walked down the quiet street, light from behind flooding across\nthem, making their shadows lengthen. To their right, a calm blue light shone\nbetween buildings—the Radiant, who fought monsters in slowed time.\nJasnah could probably learn something from these buildings, with their\nold architecture. These people wearing unfamiliar clothing. He’d have\nexpected everything in the past to be crude, but it wasn’t. The doors, the\nbuildings, the clothing. It was well made, just … lacking something he\ncouldn’t define.\n“The Everstorm proved I wasn’t mad?” Dalinar asked.\n“It proved that something was happening.”\nDalinar suddenly stopped. “You think I’m working with them! You think\nthat explains my behavior, my foreknowledge. You think I’ve been acting\nerratically because I’ve been in contact with the Voidbringers!”\n“All I knew,” Fen said, “was that the voice on the other end of the\nspanreed was not the Dalinar Kholin I’d expected. The words were too\npolite, too calm, to be trusted.”\n“And now?” Dalinar asked.\nFen turned. “Now … I’ll consider. Can I see the rest of it? I want to\nknow what happens to the little girl.”\nDalinar followed her gaze and saw—for the first time—little Seeli\nsitting, huddled with some other children near the fire. She had a haunted\ncast to her eyes. He could imagine her horror as Fen ran away, Taffa—the\nchild’s mother—screaming as she was ripped apart.\nSeeli suddenly lurched into motion, turning her head to stare with a\nhollow gaze at a woman who knelt beside her, offering something to drink.\nThe Stormfather had restored the vision’s normal speed.\nDalinar backed up, letting Fen rejoin the people and experience the end"

As he folded his arms to watch, he noted a shimmering in the\nair beside him.\n“We’ll want to send her more of these,” Dalinar said to the Stormfather.\n“We can only be served by more people knowing the truths the Almighty\nleft behind. Can you bring in only one person per storm, or can we\naccelerate that somehow? And can you bring two people into two different\nvisions at once?”\nThe Stormfather rumbled. I do not like to be ordered about.\n“And you prefer the alternative? Letting Odium win? How far will your\npride push you, Stormfather?”\nIt is not pride, the Stormfather said, sounding stubborn. I am not a man. I\ndo not bend or cower. I do what is in my nature, and to defy that is pain.\nThe Radiant finished off the last of the midnight creatures and stepped\nup to the gathered people, then looked at Fen. “Your upbringing might be\nhumble, but your talent for leadership is impressive. I have rarely seen a\nman—king or commander—organize people for defense as well as you did\nhere today.”\nFen cocked her head.\n“No words for me, I see,” the knight said. “Very well. But should you\nwish to learn true leadership, come to Urithiru.”\nDalinar turned to the Stormfather. “That’s almost exactly what the knight\nsaid to me last time.”\nBy design, certain things always happen in the visions, the Stormfather\nreplied. I do not know Honor’s every intention, but I know he wished you to\ninteract with Radiants and know that men could join them.\n“All who resist are needed,” the Radiant said to Fen. “Indeed, any who\nhave a desire to fight should be compelled to come to Alethela. We can\nteach you, help you. If you have the soul of a warrior, that passion could\ndestroy you, unless you are guided. Come to us.”\nThe Radiant strode off, then Fen jumped as Seeli stood up and started\ntalking to her. The girl’s voice was too quiet for Dalinar to hear, but he\ncould guess what was happening. At the end of each vision, the Almighty\nhimself spoke through one of the people, passing along wisdom that—at\nfirst—Dalinar had assumed was interactive.\nFen seemed troubled by what she heard. As well she should be. Dalinar\nremembered the words.\nThis is important, the Almighty had said. Do not let strife consume you.\nBe strong. Act with honor, and honor will aid you.\nExcept Honor was dead.\nAt the end of it, Fen turned toward Dalinar, her eyes measuring.\nShe still does not trust you, the Stormfather said.\n“She wonders if I created this vision with the power of the Voidbringers.\nShe no longer thinks I’m mad, but she does continue to wonder if I’ve\njoined the enemy.”\nSo you’ve failed again.\n“No,” Dalinar said. “Tonight she listened. And I think she’ll end up\ntaking the gamble of coming to Urithiru.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled, sounding confused. Why?"

I’m\nfairly certain that’s something I can deliver.”\n35. First into the Sky\nYou think yourself so clever, but my eyes are not those of some petty\nnoble, to be clouded by a false nose and some dirt on the cheeks.\nSomeone bumped Sigzil’s cot, waking him from a dream. He yawned, and\nRock’s breakfast bell began ringing in the next room.\nHe’d been dreaming in Azish. He’d been back home, studying for the\ngovernmental service tests. Passing would have qualified him to enter a real\nschool, with a shot at becoming a clerk to someone important. Only, in the\ndream, he’d been panicked to realize he’d forgotten how to read.\nAfter so many years away, thinking of his mother tongue felt strange. He\nyawned again, settling on his cot, back to the stone wall. They had three\nsmall barracks and a common room in the center.\nOut there, everyone pushed, ramble-scramble, up to the breakfast table.\nRock had to shout at them—yet again—to organize themselves. Months in\nBridge Four, now apprentice Knights Radiant, and the lot of them still\ncouldn’t figure out how to line up properly. They wouldn’t last a day in\nAzir, where queuing in an orderly way wasn’t only expected, it was\npractically a mark of national pride.\nSigzil rested his head against the wall, remembering. He’d been the first\nfrom his family in generations with a real shot at passing the exams. A silly\ndream. Everyone in Azir talked about how even the humblest man could\nbecome Prime, but the son of a laborer had so little time to study.\nHe shook his head, then washed with a basin of water he’d fetched the\nnight before. He took a comb to his hair, and inspected himself in a polished\nlength of steel. His hair was growing far too long; the tight black curls had a\ntendency to stick straight out.\nHe set out a sphere to use its light for a shave—he had acquired his own\nrazor. Soon after he started, however, he nicked himself. He sucked in a\nbreath at the pain, and his sphere winked out. What …\nHis skin started glowing, letting off a faint luminescent smoke. Oh, right.\nKaladin was back.\nWell, that was going to solve so many problems. He got out another\nsphere, and did his best not to eat this one as he finished shaving.\nAfterward, he pressed his hand against his forehead. Once, he’d had slave\nbrands there. The Stormlight had healed those, though his Bridge Four\ntattoo remained.\nHe rose and put on his uniform. Kholin blue, sharp and neat. He slid his\nnew hogshide notebook into his pocket, then stepped out into the common\nroom—and stopped short as Lopen’s face swung down right in front of him.\nSigzil almost slammed into the Herdazian, who was stuck by the bottoms of"

The\nHerdazian tried to take a bite, but the porridge slipped off his spoon and\nsplatted to the ground.\n“Lopen, what are you doing?”\n“Practicing. I’ve got to show them how good I am, hooch. It’s like with\nwomen, only it involves sticking yourself to the ceiling and learning not to\nspill food on the heads of people you like.”\n“Move, Lopen.”\n“Ah, you have to ask the right way. I’m not one-armed anymore! I can’t\nbe shoved around. Say, do you know how to get two armed Herdazians to\ndo what you want?”\n“If I did, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”\n“Well, you take away both of their spears, obviously.” He grinned. A few\nfeet away, Rock laughed with a loud “Ha!”\nLopen wiggled his fingers at Sigzil, as if to taunt him, fingernails\nglistening. Like all Herdazians, he had fingernails that were dark brown and\nhard as crystal. A bit reminiscent of carapace.\nHe still had a tattoo on his head too. Though so far only a few of Bridge\nFour had learned to draw in Stormlight, each of those had kept their tattoos.\nOnly Kaladin was different; his tattoo had melted off once he took in\nStormlight, and his scars refused to heal.\n“Remember that one for me, hooch,” Lopen said. He never would\nexplain what “hooch” meant, or why he used it only to refer to Sigzil. “I’ll\nneed, sure, lots and lots of new jokes. Also sleeves. Twice as many of those,\nexcept on vests. Then the same number.”\n“How did you even manage to get up there, so you could stick your\nfeet … no, don’t start. I don’t actually want to know.” Sigzil ducked under\nLopen.\nThe men were still scrambling for food, laughing and shouting in\ncomplete disarray. Sigzil shouted to get their attention. “Don’t forget! The\ncaptain wanted us up and ready for inspection by second bell!”\nSigzil could barely be heard. Where was Teft? They actually listened\nwhen he gave orders. Sigzil shook his head, weaving his way toward the\ndoor. Among his people, he was of average height—but he’d gone and\nmoved among the Alethi, who were practically giants. So here, he was a few\ninches shorter than most.\nHe slipped out into the hallway. The bridge crews occupied a sequence\nof large barracks on the tower’s first floor. Bridge Four were gaining\nRadiant powers, but there were hundreds more men in the battalion who\nwere still ordinary infantry. Perhaps Teft had gone to inspect the other\ncrews; he’d been given responsibility for training them.

Sigzil made his way there, going over his scribbles in the\nnotebook. He used Alethi glyphs, as was acceptable for a man out here, and\nhad never learned their actual writing system. Storms, he’d been away so\nlong, the dream was probably right. He might have trouble writing in the\nAzish script.\nWhat would life be like if he hadn’t turned into a failure and a\ndisappointment? If he’d passed the tests, instead of getting into trouble,\nneeding to be rescued by the man who had become his master?\nThe list of problems first, he decided, reaching Kaladin’s door and\nknocking.\n“Come!” the captain’s voice said from inside.\nSigzil found Kaladin doing morning push-ups on the stone floor. His\nblue jacket was draped over a chair.\n“Sir,” Sigzil said.\n“Hey, Sig,” Kaladin said, grunting as he continued his push-ups. “Are\nthe men up and mustered?”\n“Up, yes,” Sigzil said. “When I left them, they seemed bordering on a\nfood fight, and only half were in uniform.”\n“They’ll be ready,” Kaladin said. “Was there something you wanted,\nSig?”\nSigzil settled down in the chair next to Kaladin’s coat and opened his\nnotebook. “A lot of things, sir. Not the least of which is the fact that you\nshould have a real scribe, not … whatever I am.”\n“You’re my clerk.”\n“A poor one. We’ve a full battalion of fighting men with only four\nlieutenants and no official scribes. Frankly, sir, the bridge crews are a mess.\nOur finances are in shambles, requisition orders are piling up faster than\nLeyten can deal with them, and there’s an entire host of problems requiring\nan officer’s attention.”\nKaladin grunted. “The fun part of running an army.”\n“Exactly.”\n“That was sarcasm, Sig.” Kaladin stood up and wiped his brow with a\ntowel. “All right. Go ahead.”\n“We’ll start with something easy,” Sigzil said. “Peet is now officially\nbetrothed to the woman he’s been seeing.”\n“Ka? That’s wonderful. Maybe she could help you with scribe duties.”\n“Perhaps. I believe that you were looking into requisitioning housing for\nmen with families?”\n“Yeah. That was before the whole mess with the Weeping, and the\nexpedition onto the Shattered Plains, and … And I should go back to\nDalinar’s scribes about it, shouldn’t I?”\n“Unless you expect the married couples to share a bunk in the standard\nbarracks, then I’d say that yes, you should.” Sigzil looked to the next page\nin his book. “I believe that Bisig is close to being betrothed as well.”\n“Really? He’s so quiet. I never know what’s going on behind those eyes\nof his.”\n“Not to mention Punio, who I found out recently is already married. His\nwife drops off food for him.”\n“I thought that was his sister!”"

His\nwife drops off food for him.”\n“I thought that was his sister!”\n“He wanted to fit in, I believe,” Sigzil said. “His broken Alethi already\nmakes that hard. And then there’s the matter of Drehy…”\n“What matter?”\n“Well, he’s been courting a man, you see…”\nKaladin threw on his coat, chuckling. “I did know about that one. You\nonly now noticed?”\nSigzil nodded.\n“It’s Dru he’s been seeing, still? From the district quartermaster’s\noffices?”\n“Yes, sir.” Sigzil looked down. “Sir, I … Well, it’s just that…”\n“Yes?”\n“Sir, Drehy hasn’t filled out the proper forms,” Sigzil said. “If he wants\nto court another man, he needs to apply for social reassignment, right?”\nKaladin rolled his eyes. So, there were no forms for that in Alethkar.\nSigzil couldn’t say he was surprised, as the Alethi didn’t have proper\nprocedures for anything. “Then how do you apply for social reassignment?”\n“We don’t.” Kaladin frowned. “Is this really that big a problem to you,\nSig? Maybe—”\n“Sir, it’s not this specifically. Right now, there are four religions\nrepresented in Bridge Four.”\n“Four?”\n“Hobber follows the Passions, sir. Four, even if you don’t count Teft,\nwho I can’t figure out rightly. And now there’s all this talk of Brightlord\nDalinar claiming the Almighty is dead, and … Well, I feel responsible, sir.”\n“For Dalinar?” Kaladin frowned.\n“No, no.” He took a deep breath. There had to be a way to explain this.\nWhat would his master do?\n“Now,” Sigzil said, scrambling at an idea, “everybody knows that\nMishim—the third moon—is the most clever and wily of the moons.”\n“All right … And this is relevant, why?”\n“Because of a story,” Sigzil said. “Hush. Uh, I mean, please listen, sir.\nYou see, there are three moons, and the third moon is the cleverest. And she\ndoesn’t want to be in the sky, sir. She wants to escape.\n“So one night, she tricked the queen of the Natan people—this was a\nlong time ago, so they were still around. I mean, they’re still around now,\nbut they were more around then, sir. And the moon tricked her, and then\nthey traded places until they stopped. And now the Natan people have blue\nskin. Does that make sense?”\nKaladin blinked. “I have no idea what you just said.”\n“Um, well,” Sigzil said. “It’s obviously fanciful. Not the real reason that\nthe Natan people have blue skin. And, um…”\n“It was supposed to explain something?”\n“It’s how my master always did things,” Sigzil said, looking at his feet.\n“He’d tell a story anytime someone was confused, or when people were\nangry at him.

Storms. Master Hoid had named him a full Worldsinger,\nand here he couldn’t even tell a story straight.\nKaladin clapped him on the shoulder. “It’s all right, Sig.”\n“Sir,” Sigzil said. “The other men don’t have any direction. You’ve given\nthem purpose, a reason to be good men. They are good men. But in some\nways, it was easy when we were slaves. What do we do if not all the men\nmanifest the ability to draw in Stormlight? What is our place in the army?\nBrightlord Kholin released us from guard duty, as he said he wanted us\npracticing and training as Radiants instead. But what is a Knight Radiant?”\n“We’ll need to figure it out.”\n“And if the men need guidance? If they need a moral center? Someone\nhas to talk to them when they’re doing something wrong, but the ardents\nignore us, since they associate us with the things Brightlord Dalinar is\nsaying and doing.”\n“You think you can be the one to guide the men instead?” Kaladin asked.\n“Someone should, sir.”\nKaladin waved for Sigzil to follow him out into the corridor. Together\nthey started walking toward the Bridge Four barracks, Sigzil holding out a\nsphere for light.\n“I don’t mind if you want to be something like our unit’s ardent,”\nKaladin said. “The men like you, Sig, and they put a lot of stock in what\nyou have to say. But you should try to understand what they want out of\nlife, and respect that, rather than projecting onto them what you think they\nshould want out of life.”\n“But sir, some things are just wrong. You know what Teft has gotten into,\nand Huio, he’s been visiting the prostitutes.”\n“That’s not forbidden. Storms, I’ve had some sergeants who suggested it\nas the key to a healthy mind in battle.”\n“It’s wrong, sir. It’s imitating an oath without the commitment. Every\nmajor religion agrees to this, except the Reshi, I suppose. But they’re\npagans even among pagans.”\n“Your master teach you to be this judgmental?”\nSigzil stopped short.\n“I’m sorry, Sig,” Kaladin said.\n“No, he said the same thing about me. All the time, sir.”\n“I give you permission to sit down with Huio and explain your worries,”\nKaladin said. “I won’t forbid you from expressing your morals—I’d\nencourage it. Just don’t present your beliefs as our code. Present them as\nyours, and make a good argument. Maybe the men will listen.”\nSigzil nodded, hurrying to catch up. To cover his embarrassment—more\nat completely failing to tell the right story than anything else—he dug into\nhis notebook. “That does raise another issue, sir. Bridge Four is down to\ntwenty-eight members, after our losses during the first Everstorm. Might be\ntime for some recruitment.”\n“Recruitment?” Kaladin said. He cocked his head.\n“Well, if we lose any more members—”"

Maybe we don’t need to keep that number, but a good\nactive unit should always be watching for people to recruit.\n“What if someone else in the army has been displaying the right attitude\nto be a Windrunner? Or, more pointedly, what if our men start swearing\noaths and bonding their own spren? Would we dissolve Bridge Four, and let\neach man be their own Radiant?”\nThe idea of dissolving Bridge Four seemed to pain Kaladin almost as\nmuch as the idea of losing men in battle. They walked in silence for a short\ntime. They weren’t going to the Bridge Four barracks after all; Kaladin had\ntaken a turn deeper into the tower. They passed a water wagon, pulled by\nlaborers to deliver water from the wells to the officers’ quarters. Normally\nthat would be parshman work.\n“We should at least put out a call for recruitment,” Kaladin finally said,\n“though honestly I can’t think of how I’ll cull hopefuls down to a\nmanageable number.”\n“I’ll try to come up with some strategies, sir,” Sigzil said. “If I might ask,\nwhere are we…” He trailed off as he saw Lyn hurrying down the hallway\ntoward them. She carried a diamond chip in her palm for light, and wore her\nKholin uniform, her dark Alethi hair pulled back in a tail.\nShe drew up when she saw Kaladin, then saluted him smartly. “Just the\nman I was looking for. Quartermaster Vevidar sends word that ‘your\nunusual request has been fulfilled,’ sir.”\n“Excellent,” Kaladin said, marching through the hallway past her. Sigzil\nshot her a look as she fell in with him, and she shrugged. She didn’t know\nwhat the unusual request was, only that it had been fulfilled.\nKaladin eyed Lyn as they walked. “You’re the one who has been helping\nmy men, right? Lyn, was it?”\n“Yes, sir!”\n“In fact, it seems you’ve been making excuses to run messages to Bridge\nFour.”\n“Um, yes, sir.”\n“Not afraid of the ‘Lost Radiants’ then?”\n“Frankly, sir, after what I saw on the battlefield, I’d rather be on your\nside than bet on the opposition.”\nKaladin nodded, thoughtful as he walked. “Lyn,” he finally said, “how\nwould you like to join the Windrunners?”\nThe woman stopped in place, jaw dropping. “Sir?” She saluted. “Sir, I’d\nlove that! Storms!”\n“Excellent,” Kaladin said. “Sig, can you get her our ledgers and\naccounts?”\nLyn’s hand drooped from her brow. “Ledgers? Accounts?”\n“The men will also need letters written to family members,” Kaladin\nsaid. “And we should probably write a history of Bridge Four. People will\nbe curious, and a written account will save me from having to explain it all\nthe time.”"

If that’s what you’re offering, I’ll have to pass.”\nHer shoulders fell, and she wouldn’t meet Kaladin’s eyes. Sigzil found,\nstrangely, that he wanted to punch his captain. Not hard, mind you. Just a\ngentle “wake up” punch. He couldn’t remember feeling that way with\nKaladin since the time the captain had woken him up that first morning,\nback in Sadeas’s warcamp.\n“I see,” Kaladin said. “Well … we’re going to have tryouts to join the\norder proper. I suppose I could extend you an invitation. If you’d like.”\n“Tryouts?” she said. “For real positions? Not just doing accounts?\nStorms, I’m in.”\n“Speak with your superior, then,” Kaladin said. “I haven’t devised the\nproper test yet, and you’d need to pass it before you could be let in. Either\nway, you’d need clearance to change battalions.”\n“Yes, sir!” she said, and bounded off.\nKaladin watched her go, then grunted softly.\nSigzil—without even thinking about it—mumbled, “Did your master\nteach you to be that insensitive?”\nKaladin eyed him.\n“I have a suggestion, sir,” Sigzil continued. “Try to understand what\npeople want out of life, and respect that, rather than projecting onto them\nwhat you think they should—”\n“Shut it, Sig.”\n“Yes, sir.

But you’re a lighteyes now, and a Shardbearer and … well,\nit feels right.”\nKaladin stiffened, but didn’t contradict him. In truth, Sigzil had always\nfelt … awkward trying to treat Kaladin like any other bridgeman. Some of\nthe others could do it—Teft and Rock, Lopen in his own strange way. But\nSigzil felt more comfortable when the relationship was set out and clear.\nCaptain and his clerk.\nMoash had been the closest to Kaladin, but he wasn’t in Bridge Four any\nlonger. Kaladin hadn’t said what Moash had done, only that he had\n“removed himself from our fellowship.” Kaladin got stiff and unresponsive\nwhenever Moash’s name was mentioned.\n“Anything else on that list of yours?” Kaladin asked as they passed a\nguard patrol in the hallway. He received crisp salutes.\nSigzil looked through his notebook. “Accounts and the need for\nscribes … Code of morals for the men … Recruitment … Oh, we’re still"

He received crisp salutes.\nSigzil looked through his notebook. “Accounts and the need for\nscribes … Code of morals for the men … Recruitment … Oh, we’re still\ngoing to need to define our place in the army, now that we’re no longer\nbodyguards.”\n“We’re still bodyguards,” Kaladin said. “We just protect anyone who\nneeds it. We have bigger problems, in that storm.”\nIt had come again, a third time, this event proving that it was even more\nregular than the highstorms. Right around every nine days. Up high as they\nwere, its passing was only a curiosity—but throughout the world, each new\narrival strained already beleaguered cities.\n“I realize that, sir,” Sigzil said. “But we still have to worry about\nprocedure. Here, let me ask this. Are we, as Knights Radiant, still an Alethi\nmilitary organization?”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “This war is bigger than Alethkar. We’re for all\nmankind.”\n“All right, then what’s our chain of command? Do we obey King\nElhokar? Are we still his subjects? And what dahn or nahn are we in\nsociety? You’re a Shardbearer in Dalinar’s court, aren’t you?\n“Who pays the wages of Bridge Four? What about the other bridge\ncrews? If there is a squabble over Dalinar’s lands in Alethkar, can he call\nyou—and Bridge Four—up to fight for him, like a normal liege-vassal\nrelationship? If not, then can we still expect him to pay us?”\n“Damnation,” Kaladin breathed.\n“I’m sorry, sir. It—”\n“No, they’re good questions, Sig. I’m lucky to have you to ask them.”\nHe clasped Sigzil on the shoulder, stopping in the hallway just outside the\nquartermaster’s offices. “Sometimes I wonder if you’re wasted in Bridge\nFour. You should’ve been a scholar.”\n“Well, that wind blew past me years ago, sir. I…” He took a deep breath.\n“I failed the exams for government training in Azir. I wasn’t good enough.”\n“Then the exams were stupid,” Kaladin said. “And Azir lost out, because\nthey missed the chance to have you.”\nSigzil smiled. “I’m glad they did.” And … strangely, he felt it was true.\nA nameless weight he’d been carrying seemed to slide off his back.\n“Honestly, I feel like Lyn. I don’t want to be huddled over a ledger when\nBridge Four takes to the air. I want to be first into the sky.”\n“I think you’ll have to fight Lopen for that distinction,” Kaladin said\nwith a chuckle. “Come on.” He strode into the quartermaster’s office, where\na group of waiting guardsmen immediately made space for him. At the\ncounter, a beefy soldier with rolled-up sleeves searched through boxes and\ncrates, muttering to himself. A stout woman—presumably his wife—\ninspected requisition forms. She nudged the man and pointed at Kaladin.\n“Finally!” the quartermaster said. “I’m tired of having these here,\ndrawing everyone’s eyes and making me sweat like a spy with too many\nspren.”"

        "text": "“Finally!” the quartermaster said. “I’m tired of having these here,\ndrawing everyone’s eyes and making me sweat like a spy with too many\nspren.”\nHe shuffled over to a pair of large black sacks in the corner that, best that\nSigzil could tell, weren’t drawing any eyes at all. The quartermaster hefted\nthem and glanced at the scribe, who double-checked a few forms, then\nnodded, presenting them for Kaladin to stamp with his captain’s seal.\nPaperwork done, the quartermaster handed a sack to Kaladin and another to\nSigzil.\nThey clinked when moved, and were surprisingly heavy. Sigzil undid the\nties and glanced into his.\nA flood of green light, powerful as sunlight, shone out over him.\nEmeralds. The large type, not in spheres, probably cut from the gemhearts\nof chasmfiends hunted on the Shattered Plains. In a moment, Sigzil realized\nthat the guards filling the room weren’t here to get something from the\nquartermaster. They were here to protect this wealth.\n“That’s the royal emerald reserve,” the quartermaster said. “Held for\nemergency grain, renewed with Light in the storm this morning. How you\ntalked the highprince into letting you take it is beyond me.”\n“We’re only borrowing them,” Kaladin said. “We’ll have them back\nbefore evening arrives. Though be warned, some will be dun. We’ll need to\ncheck them out tomorrow again. And the day after that…”\n“I could buy a princedom for that much,” the quartermaster said with a\ngrunt. “What in Kelek’s name do you need them for?”\nSigzil, however, had already guessed. He grinned like a fool. “We’re\ngoing to practice being Radiant.”\n36. Hero\nTWENTY-FOUR YEARS AGO\nDalinar cursed as smoke billowed out of the fireplace. He shoved his weight\nagainst the lever and managed to budge it, reopening the chimney flue. He\ncoughed, backing up and waving smoke away from his face.\n“We are going to need to see that replaced,” Evi said from the sofa where\nshe was doing needlework.\n“Yeah,” Dalinar said, thumping down to the floor before the fire.\n“At least you got to it quickly. Today we will not need to scrub the walls,\nand the life will be as white as a sun at night!”\nEvi’s native idioms didn’t always translate well into Alethi.\nThe fire’s heat was welcome, as Dalinar’s clothing was still damp from\nthe rains. He tried to ignore the ever-present sound of the Weeping’s rain\noutside, instead watching a pair of flamespren dance along one of the logs.\nThese seemed vaguely human, with ever-shifting figures. He followed one\nwith his eyes as it leaped toward the other.\nHe heard Evi rise, and thought she might be off to seek the privy again.\nShe instead settled down next to him and took his arm, then sighed in\ncontentment.\n“That can’t be comfortable,” Dalinar said.\n“And yet you are doing it.”\n“I’m not the one who is…” He looked at her belly, which had begun to\nround.\nEvi smiled. “My condition does not make me so frail that I risk breaking"

You went through so much to make this kingdom. Can’t you\nbe satisfied, now that you’ve won?”\nHe stood up, pulling his arm from her grip, and crossed the chamber to\npour himself a drink.\n“Don’t think I haven’t noticed the way you act,” Evi said. “Perking up\nwhenever the king speaks of the smallest conflict beyond our borders.\nHaving the scribes read to you of great battles. Always talking about the\nnext duel.”\n“I’m not to have that much longer,” Dalinar grumbled, then took a sip of\nwine. “Gavilar says it’s foolish to endanger myself, says someone is bound\nto try to use one of those duels as a ploy against him. I’ll have to get a\nchampion.” He stared at his wine.\nHe’d never had a high opinion of dueling. It was too fake, too sanitized.\nBut at least it was something.\n“It’s like you’re dead,” Evi said.\nDalinar looked over at her.\n“It’s like you only live when you can fight,” she continued. “When you\ncan kill. Like a blackness from old stories. You live only by taking lives\nfrom others.”\nWith that pale hair and light golden skin, she was like a glowing\ngemstone. She was a sweet, loving woman who deserved better than the\ntreatment he gave her. He forced himself to go back and sit down beside\nher.\n“I still think the flamespren are playing,” she said.\n“I’ve always wondered,” Dalinar said. “Are they made of fire\nthemselves? It looks like they are, and yet what of emotion spren? Are\nangerspren then made of anger?”\nEvi nodded absently.\n“And what of gloryspren?” Dalinar said. “Made of glory? What is glory?\nCould gloryspren appear around someone who is delusional, or perhaps\nvery drunk—who only thinks they’ve accomplished something great, while\neveryone else is standing around mocking them?”\n“A mystery,” she said, “sent by Shishi.”\n“But don’t you ever wonder?”\n“To what end?” Evi said. “We will know eventually, when we return to\nthe One. No use troubling our minds now about things we cannot\nunderstand.”\nDalinar narrowed his eyes at the flamespren. That one did have a sword.\nA miniature Shardblade.\n“This is why you brood so often, husband,” Evi said. “It isn’t healthy to\nhave a stone curdling in your stomach, still wet with moss.”\n“I … What?”\n“You must not think such strange thoughts.

Who put such things into\nyour mind anyway?”\nHe shrugged, but thought of two nights before, staying up late and\ndrinking wine beneath the rain canopy with Gavilar and Navani. She’d\ntalked and talked about her research into spren, and Gavilar had simply\ngrunted, while making notations in glyphs on a set of his maps. She’d\nspoken with such passion and excitement, and Gavilar had ignored her.\n“Enjoy the moment,” Evi told him. “Close your eyes and contemplate\nwhat the One has given you. Seek the peace of oblivion, and bask in the joy\nof your own sensation.”\nHe closed his eyes as she suggested, and tried to simply enjoy being here\nwith her. “Can a man actually change, Evi? Like those spren change?”\n“We are all different aspects of the One.”\n“Then can you change from one aspect to another?”\n“Of course,” Evi said. “Is not your own doctrine about transformation?\nAbout a man being Soulcast from crass to glorious?”\n“I don’t know if it’s working.”\n“Then petition the One,” she said.\n“In prayer? Through the ardents?”\n“No, silly. Yourself.”\n“In person?” Dalinar asked. “Like, at a temple?”\n“If you wish to meet the One in person, you must travel to the Valley,”\nshe said. “There you can speak with the One, or to his avatar, and be\ngranted—”\n“The Old Magic,” Dalinar hissed, opening his eyes. “The Nightwatcher.\nEvi, don’t say things like that.” Storms, her pagan heritage popped up at the\nstrangest times. She could be talking good Vorin doctrine, then out came\nsomething like that.\nFortunately, she spoke of it no more. She closed her eyes and hummed\nsoftly. Finally, a knock came at the outer door to his rooms.\nHathan, his room steward, would answer that. Indeed, Dalinar heard the\nman’s voice outside, and that was followed by a light rap on the chamber\ndoor. “It is your brother, Brightlord,” Hathan said through the door.\nDalinar leaped, opening the door and passing the short master-servant.\nEvi followed, trailing along with one hand touching the wall, a habit of\nhers. They passed open windows that looked down upon a sodden Kholinar,\nflickering lanterns marking where people moved through the streets.\nGavilar waited in the sitting room, dressed in one of those new suits with\nthe stiff jacket and buttons up the sides of the chest. His dark hair curled to\nhis shoulders, and was matched by a fine beard.\nDalinar hated beards; they got caught in your helm. He couldn’t deny its\neffect on Gavilar though. Looking at Gavilar in his finery, one didn’t see a\nbackwater thug—a barely civilized warlord who had crushed and conquered\nhis way to the throne. No, this man was a king.\nGavilar rapped a set of papers against the palm of his hand.\n“What?” Dalinar asked.\n“Rathalas,” Gavilar said, shoving the papers toward Evi as she entered.\n“Again!” Dalinar said.

It had been years since he’d visited the Rift, that\ngiant trench where he’d won his Shardblade.\n“They’re demanding your Blade back,” Gavilar said. “They claim that\nTanalan’s heir has returned, and deserves the Shard, as you never won it in a\ntrue contest.”\nDalinar felt cold.\n“Now, I know this to be patently false,” Gavilar said, “because when we\nfought at Rathalas all those years ago, you said you dealt with the heir. You\ndid deal with the heir, did you not, Dalinar?”\nHe remembered that day. He remembered darkening that doorway, the\nThrill pulsing inside him. He remembered a weeping child holding a\nShardblade. The father, lying broken and dead behind. That soft voice,\npleading.\nThe Thrill had vanished in a moment.\n“He was a child, Gavilar,” Dalinar said, his voice hoarse.\n“Damnation!” Gavilar said. “He’s a descendant of the old regime. That\nwas … storms, that was a decade ago. He’s old enough to be a threat! The\nwhole city is going into rebellion, the entire region. If we don’t act, the\nwhole Crownlands could break off.”\nDalinar smiled. The emotion shocked him, and he quickly stifled the\ngrin. But surely … surely someone would need to go and rout the rebels.\nHe turned and caught sight of Evi. She was beaming at him, though he’d\nhave expected her to be indignant at the idea of more wars. Instead, she\nstepped up to him and took his arm. “You spared the child.”\n“I … He could barely lift the Blade. I gave him to his mother, and told\nher to hide him.”\n“Oh, Dalinar.” She pulled him close.\nHe felt a swelling of pride. Ridiculous, of course. He had endangered the\nkingdom—how would people react if they knew the Blackthorn himself had\nbroken before a crisis of conscience? They’d laugh.\nIn that moment, he didn’t care. So long as he could be a hero to this\nwoman.\n“Well, I suppose rebellion was to be expected,” Gavilar said as he stared\nout the window. “It’s been years since the formal unification; people are\ngoing to start asserting their independence.” He raised his hand toward\nDalinar, turning. “I know what you want, Brother, but you’ll have to\nforbear. I’m not sending an army.”\n“But—”\n“I can nip this thing with politics. We can’t have a show of force be our\nonly method of maintaining unity, or Elhokar will spend his entire life\nputting out fires after I’m gone. We need people to start thinking of Alethkar\nas a unified kingdom, not separate regions always looking for an advantage\nagainst one another.”\n“Sounds good,” Dalinar said.\nIt wasn’t going to happen, not without the sword to remind them.

It is a pity about Aona and\nSkai, but they were foolish—violating our pact from the very\nbeginning.\nNumuhukumakiaki’aialunamor had always been taught that the first rule of\nwarfare was to know your enemy. One might assume that such lessons\nweren’t terribly relevant in his life anymore. Fortunately, making a good\nstew was a lot like going to war.\nLunamor—called Rock by his friends, on account of their thick,\nlowlander tongues being incapable of proper speech—stirred his cauldron\nwith an enormous wooden spoon the size of a longsword. A fire burned\nrockbud husks underneath, and a playful windspren whipped at the smoke,\nmaking it blow across him no matter where he stood.\nHe had placed the cauldron on a plateau of the Shattered Plains, and—\nbeautiful lights and fallen stars—he was surprised to discover that he had\nmissed this place. Who would have thought he could become fond of this\nbarren, windswept flatland? His homeland was a place of extremes: bitter\nice, powdery snow, boiling heat, and blessed humidity.\nDown here, everything was so … moderate, and the Shattered Plains\nwere the worst of all. In Jah Keved he’d found vine-covered valleys. In\nAlethkar they had fields of grain, rockbuds spreading endlessly like the\nbubbles of a boiling cauldron. Then the Shattered Plains. Endless empty\nplateaus with barely anything growing on them. Strangely, he loved them.\nLunamor hummed softly as he stirred with two hands, churning the stew\nand keeping the bottom from burning. When the smoke wasn’t in his face—\nthis cursed, too-thick wind had too much air to behave properly—he could\nsmell the scent of the Shattered Plains. An … open scent. The scent of a\nhigh sky and baking stones, but spiced by the hint of life in the chasms.\nLike a pinch of salt. Humid, alive with the odors of plants and rot\nintermingling.\nIn those chasms, Lunamor had found himself again after a long time\nbeing lost. Renewed life, renewed purpose.\nAnd stew.\nLunamor tasted his stew—using a fresh spoon of course, as he wasn’t a\nbarbarian like some of these lowlander cooks. The longroots still had\nfurther to cook before he could add the meat. Real meat, from finger crabs\nhe’d spent all night shelling. Couldn’t cook that too long, or it got rubbery.\nThe rest of Bridge Four stood arrayed on the plateau, listening to\nKaladin. Lunamor had set up so that his back was toward Narak, the city at\nthe center of the Shattered Plains. Nearby, one of the plateaus flashed as\nRenarin Kholin worked the Oathgate. Lunamor tried not to be distracted by\nthat. He wanted to look out westward. Toward the old warcamps.\nNot much longer now to wait, he thought. But don’t dwell on that.

The\nstew needs more crushed limm.\n“I trained many of you in the chasms,” Kaladin said. The men of Bridge\nFour had been augmented by some members of the other bridge crews, and\neven a couple of soldiers that Dalinar had suggested for training. The group\nof five scout women was surprising, but who was Lunamor to judge?\n“I could train people in the spear,” Kaladin continued, “because I myself\nhad been trained in the spear. What we’re attempting today is different. I\nbarely understand how I learned to use Stormlight. We’re going to have to\nstumble through this together.”\n“It’s all good, gancho,” Lopen called. “How hard can it be to learn how\nto fly? Skyeels do it all the time, and they are ugly and stupid. Most\nbridgemen are only one of those things.”\nKaladin stopped in line near Lopen. The captain seemed in good spirits\ntoday, for which Lunamor took credit. He had, after all, made Kaladin’s\nbreakfast.\n“The first step will be to speak the Ideal,” Kaladin said. “I suspect a few\nof you have already said it. But for the rest, if you wish to be a squire to the\nWindrunners, you will need to swear it.”\nThey began belting out the words. Everyone knew the right ones by now.\nLunamor whispered the Ideal.\nLife before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination.\nKaladin handed Lopen a pouch full of gemstones. “The real test, and\nproof of your squireship, will be learning to draw Stormlight into\nyourselves. A few of you have learned it already—”\nLopen started glowing immediately.\n“—and they will help the rest learn. Lopen, take First, Second, and Third\nSquads. Sigzil, you’ve got Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth. Peet, don’t think I\nhaven’t seen you glowing. You take the other bridgemen, and Teft, you take\nthe scouts and…”\nKaladin looked around. “Where is Teft?”\nHe was only just noticing? Lunamor loved their captain, but he got\ndistracted sometimes. Maybe airsickness.\n“Teft didn’t come back to the barracks last night, sir,” Leyten called,\nlooking uncomfortable.\n“Fine. I’ll help the scouts. Lopen, Sigzil, Peet, talk your squads through\nhow to draw in Stormlight. Before the day is done, I want everyone on this\nplateau glowing like they swallowed a lantern.”\nThey broke up, obviously eager. Translucent red streamers rose from the\nstone, whipping as if in the wind, one end connected to the ground.\nAnticipationspren. Lunamor gave them the sign of respect, hand to his\nshoulder, then his forehead. These were lesser gods, but still holy. He could\nsee their true shapes beyond the streamers, a faint shadow of a larger\ncreature at the bottom.\nLunamor handed off his stirring to Dabbid.

He could stir though, and run waterskins. He had become\nsomething of an unofficial mascot for the team, as he’d been the first\nbridgeman that Kaladin had saved. When bridgemen passed Dabbid, they\ngave a subtle salute.\nHuio was on kitchen duty with Lunamor today, as was becoming more\ncommon. Huio requested it, and the others avoided it. The squat, beefy\nHerdazian man was humming softly to himself as he stirred the shiki, a\nbrownish Horneater drink that Lunamor had chilled overnight in metal bins\non the plateau outside Urithiru.\nStrangely, Huio took a handful of lazbo from a pot and sprinkled it into\nthe liquid.\n“What are you doing, crazy man!” Lunamor bellowed, stomping up.\n“Lazbo? In drink? That thing is spicy powder, airsick lowlander!”\nHuio said something in Herdazian.\n“Bah!” Lunamor said. “I do not speak this crazy language you use.\nLopen! Come here and talk to this cousin you have! He is ruining our\ndrinks!”\nLopen, however, was gesturing wildly at the sky and talking about how\nhe’d stuck himself to the ceiling earlier.\nLunamor grunted and looked back at Huio, who proffered a spoon\ndripping with liquid.\n“Airsick fool,” Lunamor said, taking a sip. “You will ruin…”\nBlessed gods of sea and stone. That was good. The spice added just the\nright kick to the chilled drink, combining flavors in a completely unexpected\n—yet somehow complementary—way.\nHuio smiled. “Bridge Four!” he said in thickly accented Alethi.\n“You are lucky man,” Lunamor said, pointing. “I will not kill you today.”\nHe took another sip, then gestured with the spoon. “Go do this thing to\nother bins of shiki.”\nNow, where was Hobber? The lanky, gap-toothed man couldn’t be too\nfar away. That was one advantage of having an assistant chef who could not\nwalk; he usually stayed where you put him.\n“Watch me now, carefully!” Lopen said to his group, Stormlight puffing\nfrom his mouth as he spoke. “All right. Here it is. I, the Lopen, will now fly.\nYou may applaud as you feel is appropriate.”\nHe jumped up, then crashed back to the plateau.\n“Lopen!” Kaladin called. “You’re supposed to be helping the others, not\nshowing off!”\n“Sorry, gon!” Lopen said. He quivered on the ground, his face pressed to\nthe stone, and didn’t rise.\n“Did you … did you stick yourself to the ground?” Kaladin asked.\n“Just part of the plan, gon!” Lopen called back. “If I am to become a\ndelicate cloud upon the sky, I must first convince the ground that I am not\nabandoning her.

I am a former king. You are obviously one of the\nstupid ones I mentioned earlier.”\nLunamor grunted in amusement and rounded his little cooking station\ntoward Hobber, who he now remembered was peeling tubers by the side of\nthe plateau. Lunamor slowed. Why was Kaladin kneeling before Hobber’s\nstool, holding out … a gemstone?\nAhhh … Lunamor thought.\n“I had to breathe to draw it in,” Kaladin explained softly. “I’d been\ndoing it unconsciously for weeks, maybe months, before Teft explained the\ntruth to me.”\n“Sir,” Hobber said, “I don’t know if … I mean, sir, I’m no Radiant. I was\nnever that good with the spear. I’m barely a passable cook.”\nPassable was a stretch. But he was earnest and helpful, so Lunamor was\nhappy to have him. Besides, he needed a job he could do sitting. A month\nback, the Assassin in White had swept through the king’s palace at the\nwarcamps, trying to kill Elhokar—and the attack had left Hobber with dead\nlegs.\nKaladin folded the gemstone in Hobber’s fingers. “Just try,” the captain\nsaid softly. “Being a Radiant isn’t so much about your strength or skill, but\nabout your heart. And yours is the best of all of us.”\nThe captain seemed intimidating to many outsiders. A perpetual storm\nfor an expression, an intensity that made men wilt when it turned on them.\nBut there was also an astonishing tenderness to this man. Kaladin gripped\nHobber on the arm, and almost seemed to be tearing up.\nSome days, it seemed you couldn’t break Kaladin Stormblessed with all\nthe stones on Roshar. Then one of his men would get wounded, and you’d\nsee him crack.\nKaladin headed back toward the scouts he’d been helping, and Lunamor\njogged to catch up. He bowed to the little god who rode on the bridge\ncaptain’s shoulder, then asked, “You think Hobber can do this thing,\nKaladin?”\n“I’m sure he can. I’m sure all of Bridge Four can, and perhaps some of\nthese others.”\n“Ha!” Lunamor said. “Finding a smile on your face, Kaladin\nStormblessed, is like finding lost sphere in your soup. Surprising, yes, but\nvery nice too. Come, I have drink you must try.”\n“I need to get back to—”\n“Come! Drink you must try!” Lunamor guided him to the big pot of\nshiki and poured him a cup.\nKaladin slurped it down. “Hey, that’s pretty good, Rock!”\n“Is not my recipe,” Lunamor said. “Huio has changed this thing. I now\nhave to either promote him or push him off side of plateau.”\n“Promote him to what?” Kaladin asked, getting himself another cup.\n“To airsick lowlander,” Lunamor said, “second class.”"

The Lopen is vast enough to be possessed by many,\nmany forces, both terrestrial and celestial! I must soar to the air, for if I were\nto remain only on the ground, surely my growing magnitude would cause\nthe land to crack and break.”\nLunamor looked to Kaladin. “I am fond of term, yes. But only because\nthis thing has astounding number of applications among you.”\nKaladin grinned, sipping his shiki and watching the men. Farther along\nthe plateau, Drehy suddenly raised his long arms and called out, “Ha!” He\nwas glowing with Stormlight. Bisig soon followed. That should fix his hand\n—he too had been injured by the Assassin in White.\n“This will work, Rock,” Kaladin said. “The men have been close to the\npower for months now. And once they have it, they’ll be able to heal. I\nwon’t have to go into battle worrying which of you I’ll lose.”\n“Kaladin,” Lunamor said softly. “This thing we have begun, it is still\nwar. Men will die.”\n“Bridge Four will be protected by their power.”\n“And the enemy? They will not have power?” He stepped closer. “Surely\nI do not wish to dampen Kaladin Stormblessed when he is optimistic, but\nnobody is ever perfectly safe. This is sad truth, my friend.”\n“Maybe,” Kaladin admitted. He got a distant look on his face. “Your\npeople only let younger sons go to war, right?”\n“Only tuanalikina, fourth son and younger, can be wasted in war. First,\nsecond, and third sons are too valuable.”\n“Fourth son and younger. So hardly ever.”\n“Ha! You do not know the size of Horneater families.”\n“Still, it has to mean fewer men dying in battle.”\n“Peaks are different place,” Lunamor said, smiling at Sylphrena as she\nrose off Kaladin’s shoulder and started dancing on the nearby winds. “And\nnot just because we have right amount of air for brains to work. To attack\nanother peak is costly and difficult, requiring much preparation and time.\nWe speak of this thing more than we do him.”\n“It sounds nice.”\n“You will visit with me someday!” Lunamor said. “You and all Bridge\nFour, as you are family now.”\n“Ground,” Lopen insisted, “I will still love you. I’m not attracted to\nanyone the way I am to you. Whenever I leave, I’ll come right back!”\nKaladin glanced at Lunamor.\n“Perhaps,” Lunamor noted, “when that one is away from too much toxic\nair, he will be less…”\n“Lopen?”\n“Though upon consideration, this thing would be sad.”\nKaladin chuckled, handing Lunamor his cup. Then he leaned in. “What\nhappened to your brother, Rock?”\n“My two brothers are well, so far as I know.”"

Don’t\ndeny it.”\n“Is sad story,” Lunamor said. “And today is not day for sad stories.\nToday is day for laughter, stew, flight. These things.”\nAnd hopefully … hopefully something even grander.\nKaladin patted him on the shoulder. “If you ever need to talk, I’m here.”\n“That is good to know. Though today, I believe someone else wishes to\ntalk.” Lunamor nodded toward someone crossing a bridge onto their\nplateau. A figure in a stiff blue uniform, with a silver circlet on his head.\n“The king has been eager to speak with you. Ha! Asked us several times if\nwe knew when you would return. As if we are appointment keepers for our\nglorious flying leader.”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said. “He came to see me the other day.” Kaladin braced\nhimself visibly, setting his jaw, then walked to the king, who had just\nmarched onto the plateau, trailed by a cluster of guards from Bridge Eleven.\nLunamor positioned himself working on the soup where he could listen,\nas he was curious.\n“Windrunner,” Elhokar said, nodding to Kaladin. “It seems you are right,\nyour men have had their powers restored. How soon will they be ready?”\n“They’re in fighting shape already, Your Majesty. But to master their\npowers … well, I can’t say, honestly.”\nLunamor sipped his soup and didn’t turn toward the king, but stirred and\nlistened.\n“Have you given thought to my request?” Elhokar said. “Will you fly me\nto Kholinar, so we can reclaim the city?”\n“I’ll do as my commander tells me.”\n“No,” Elhokar said. “I’m asking you, personally. Will you come? Will\nyou help me reclaim our homeland?”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said softly. “Give me some time, a few weeks at least, to\ntrain my men. I’d prefer to bring a few squire Windrunners with us—and if\nwe’re lucky, I might be able to leave a full Radiant behind to lead if\nsomething happens to me. But either way … yes, Elhokar. I’ll go with you\nto Alethkar.”\n“Good. We have some time, as Uncle wishes to try contacting people in\nKholinar using his visions. Perhaps twenty days? Can you train your squires\nin that time?”\n“I’ll have to, Your Majesty.”\nLunamor glanced at the king, who folded his arms, watching the\nWindrunners, prospective and current. He seemed to have come not just to\nspeak with Kaladin, but to watch the training. Kaladin walked back to the\nscouts—his god following in the air after him—so Lunamor brought the\nking something to drink.

Then he hesitated beside the bridge that Elhokar\nhad crossed to reach this plateau.\nTheir old bridge, from the bridge runs, had been repurposed for moving\npeople around these plateaus closest to Narak. Permanent bridges were still\nbeing reconstructed. Lunamor patted the wood. They’d thought this lost, but\na salvage party had discovered it wedged in a chasm a short distance away.\nDalinar had agreed to have it hauled up, at Teft’s request.\nConsidering what it had been through, the old bridge was in good shape.\nIt was made of tough wood, Bridge Four was. He looked beyond it, and was\nunsettled by the sight of the next plateau over—or the rubble of it. A stump\nof a plateau, made of broken rock that extended only twenty feet or so from\nthe chasm floor. Rlain said that had been an ordinary plateau, before the\nmeeting of Everstorm and highstorm at the Battle of Narak.\nDuring that terrible cataclysm when storms met, entire plateaus had been\nripped up and shattered. Though the Everstorm had returned several times,\nthe two storms had not again met over a populated area. Lunamor patted the\nold bridge, then shook his head, walking back toward his cooking station.\nThey could have trained at Urithiru, perhaps, but none of the bridgemen\nhad complained at coming here. The Shattered Plains were far better than\nthe lonesome plain before the tower. This place was just as barren, but it\nwas also theirs.\nThey also hadn’t questioned when Lunamor had decided to bring along\nhis cauldrons and supplies to make lunch. It was inefficient, true, but a hot\nmeal would make up for it—and beyond that, there was an unspoken rule.\nThough Lunamor, Dabbid, and Hobber didn’t participate in the training or\nsparring, they were still Bridge Four. They went where the others went.\nHe had Huio add the meat—with a strict charge to ask before changing\nany spices. Dabbid continued to stir placidly. He seemed content, though it\nwas hard to tell with that one. Lunamor washed his hands in a pot, then got\nto work on the bread.\nCooking was like warfare. You had to know your enemy—though his\n“enemies” in this contest were his friends. They came to each meal\nexpecting greatness, and Lunamor fought to prove himself time and time\nagain. He waged war with breads and soups, sating appetites and satisfying\nstomachs.\nAs he worked, hands deep within the dough, he could hear his mother’s\nhumming. Her careful instructions. Kaladin was wrong; Lunamor hadn’t\nbecome a cook. He’d always been one, since he could toddle up the\nstepstool to the counter and stick his fingers in the sticky dough. Yes, he’d\nonce trained with a bow. But soldiers needed to eat, and nuatoma guards\neach did several jobs, even guards with his particular heritage and blessings.\nHe closed his eyes, kneading and humming his mother’s song to a beat\nhe could almost, barely, just faintly hear.\nA short time later, he heard soft footsteps crossing the bridge behind.\nPrince Renarin stopped beside the cauldron, his duty of transferring people"

On the plateau, more than a third of\nBridge Four had figured out how to draw in Stormlight, but none of the\nnewcomers had managed it, despite Kaladin’s coaching.\nRenarin watched with flushed cheeks. He’d obviously run to get here\nonce released from his other duty, but now he was hesitant. Elhokar had set\nup to watch near some rocks, and Renarin stepped toward him, as if sitting\nat the side and watching was his place too.\n“Hey!” Lunamor said. “Renarin!”\nRenarin jumped. The boy wore his blue Bridge Four uniform, though his\nseemed somehow … neater than the others.\n“I could use some help with this bread,” Lunamor said.\nRenarin smiled immediately. All the youth ever wanted was to be treated\nlike the rest of them. Well, that attitude benefited a man. Lunamor would\nhave the highprince himself kneading dough, if he could get away with it.\nDalinar seemed like he could use a good session of making bread.\nRenarin washed his hands, then sat on the ground across from Lunamor\nand followed his lead. Lunamor ripped off a piece of dough about as wide\nas his hand, flattened it, then slapped it against one of the large stones he’d\nput to warm by the fire. The dough stuck to the stone, where it would cook\nuntil one peeled it off.\nLunamor didn’t push Renarin to talk. Some people you wanted to press,\ndraw them out. Others you wanted to let move at their own pace. Like the\ndifference between a stew you brought to a boil and one you kept at a\nsimmer.\nBut where is his god? Lunamor could see all spren. Prince Renarin had\nbonded one, except Lunamor had never been able to spot it. He bowed\nwhen Renarin wasn’t looking, just in case, and made a sign of reverence to\nthe hidden god.\n“Bridge Four is doing well,” Renarin finally said. “He’ll have them all\ndrinking Stormlight soon.”\n“Likely so,” Lunamor said. “Ha! But they have much time until they\ncatch up to you. Truthwatcher! Is good name. More people should watch\ntruth, instead of lies.”\nRenarin blushed. “I … I suppose it means I can’t be in Bridge Four\nanymore, doesn’t it?”\n“Why not?”\n“I’m a different order of Radiant,” Renarin said, eyes down as he formed\na perfectly round piece of dough, then carefully set it onto a stone.\n“You have power to heal.”\n“The Surges of Progression and Illumination. I’m not sure how to make\nthe second one work though. Shallan has explained it seven times, but I\ncan’t create even the smallest illusion. Something’s wrong.”\n“Still, only healing for now? This thing will be very useful to Bridge\nFour!”\n“I can’t be Bridge Four anymore.”\n“That is nonsense. Bridge Four is not Windrunners.”\n“Then what is it?”"

He will not fly,\nbut he is Bridge Four. I am forbidden to fight, but I am Bridge Four. And\nyou, you might have fancy title and different powers.” He leaned forward.\n“But I know Bridge Four. And you, Renarin Kholin, are Bridge Four.”\nRenarin smiled widely. “But Rock, don’t you ever worry that you aren’t\nthe person everyone thinks you are?”\n“Everyone thinks I am loud, insufferable lout!” Lunamor said. “So to be\nsomething else would not be bad thing.”\nRenarin chuckled.\n“You think this about yourself?” Lunamor said.\n“Maybe,” Renarin said, making another perfectly round piece of dough.\n“I don’t know what I am most days, Rock, but I seem to be the only one.\nSince I could walk, everyone was saying, ‘Look how bright he is. He should\nbe an ardent.’ ”\nLunamor grunted. Sometimes, even if you were loud and insufferable,\nyou knew when not to say anything.\n“Everyone thinks it’s so obvious. I have a mind for figures, don’t I? Yes,\njoin the ardents. Of course, nobody says I’m much less of a man than my\nbrother, and nobody points out that it sure would be nice for the succession\nif the sickly, strange younger brother were safely tucked away in a\nmonastery.”\n“When you say these things, you are almost not bitter!” Lunamor said.\n“Ha! Much practice must have been required.”\n“A lifetime.”\n“Tell me,” Lunamor said. “Why do you wish to be man who fights,\nRenarin Kholin?”\n“Because it’s what my father always wanted,” Renarin said immediately.\n“He may not realize it, but it’s there, Rock.”\nLunamor grunted. “Perhaps this is stupid reason, but it is reason, and I\ncan respect that. But tell me, why do you not want to become ardent or\nstormwarden?”\n“Because everyone assumes I will be!” Renarin said, slapping bread\ndown on the heated stones. “If I go and do it, I’m giving in to what they all\nsay.” He looked for something to fidget with, and Lunamor tossed him more\ndough.\n“I think,” Lunamor said, “your problem is different than you say. You\nclaim you are not the person everyone thinks you are. Maybe you worry,\ninstead, that you are that person.”\n“A sickly weakling.”\n“No,” Lunamor said, leaning in. “You can be you without this being bad\nthing. You can admit you act and think differently from your brother, but\ncan learn not to see this as flaw. It is just Renarin Kholin.”\nRenarin started kneading the dough furiously.\n“Is good,” Lunamor said, “that you learn to fight. Men do well learning"

But men also do well using what the gods have given\nthem. In the Peaks, a man may not have such choices. Is privilege!”\n“I suppose. Glys says … Well, it’s complicated. I could talk to the\nardents, but I’m hesitant to do anything that would make me stand out from\nthe other bridgemen, Rock. I’m already the oddest one in this bunch.”\n“Is that so?”\n“Don’t deny it, Rock. Lopen is … well, Lopen. And you’re obviously …\num … you. But I’m still the strange one. I’ve always been the strangest\none.”\nLunamor slapped dough onto a rock, then pointed toward where Rlain—\nthe Parshendi bridgeman they used to call Shen—sat on a rock near his\nsquad, watching quietly as the others laughed at Eth having accidentally\nstuck a stone to his hand. He wore warform, and so was taller and stronger\nthan he had been before—but the humans seemed to have completely\nforgotten that he was there.\n“Oh,” Renarin said. “I don’t know if he counts.”\n“This thing is what everyone always tells him,” Lunamor said. “Over\nand over again.”\nRenarin stared for a long time while Lunamor continued to make bread.\nFinally, Renarin stood up and dusted off his uniform, walked across the\nstone plateau, and settled down beside Rlain. Renarin fidgeted and didn’t\nsay anything, but Rlain seemed to appreciate the company anyway.\nLunamor smiled, then finished the last of the bread. He rose and set up\nthe shiki drink with a stack of wooden cups. He took another drink himself,\nthen shook his head and glanced at Huio, who was harvesting the bread.\nThe Herdazian man was glowing faintly—clearly, he’d already learned how\nto draw in Stormlight.\nAirsick Herdazian. Lunamor raised a hand and Huio tossed him a\nflatbread, which Lunamor bit. He chewed the warm bread, thoughtful.\n“More salt in the next batch?”\nThe Herdazian just kept harvesting the bread.\n“You do think they need more salt, don’t you?” Lunamor said.\nHuio shrugged.\n“Add more salt to that batch that I’ve started mixing,” Lunamor said.\n“And do not look so self-satisfied. I may still throw you off side of plateau.”\nHuio smiled and kept working.\nThe men soon started coming over for something to drink. They grinned,\nthumped Lunamor on the back, told him he was a genius. But of course,\nnone remembered that he had tried serving them shiki once before. They\nhad mostly left it in the cauldron, opting for beer instead.\nThat day they hadn’t been hot, sweaty, and frustrated. Know your enemy.\nOut here, with the right drink, he was a little god unto himself. Ha! A god of\ncool drinks and friendly advice.

It did not make the food broken, or the person broken, to not be\nliked.\nHe chatted with Leyten, who was still shaken by their experience with\nthe dark god below Urithiru. Powerful god that had been, and very\nvengeful. There were legends of such things in the Peaks; Lunamor’s great-\ngreat-great-grandfather had met with one while traveling the third divide.\nExcellent and important story, which Lunamor did not share today.\nHe calmed Leyten, commiserated with him. The thick-bodied armorer\nwas a fine man, and could talk as loudly as Lunamor sometimes. Ha! You\ncould hear him two plateaus away, which Lunamor liked. What was the\npoint of a little voice? Weren’t voices for being heard?\nLeyten went back to his practice, but others had their worries. Skar was\nthe best spearman among them—particularly now that Moash had left—but\nwas feeling self-conscious at not having drawn in Stormlight. Lunamor\nasked Skar to show him what he’d learned, and—after Skar’s instruction—\nLunamor actually managed to draw some in himself. To his delight and\nsurprise.\nSkar left with a spring to his step. Another man would have felt worse,\nbut Skar was a teacher at heart. The short man still hoped that Lunamor\nwould someday choose to fight. He was the only one of the bridgemen who\nactively spoke out about Lunamor’s pacifism.\nOnce the men had been thoroughly watered, Lunamor found himself\nlooking out across the plateaus for some sign of movement in the distance.\nWell, best to keep busy with the meal. The stew was perfect—he was\npleased to have been able to get the crabs. So much of what everyone ate in\nthe tower was of Soulcast grain or meat, neither of which was very\nappetizing. The flatbread had cooked up nicely, and he’d even been able to\nconcoct a chutney last night. Now he just had to …\nLunamor almost stumbled into his own cauldron as he saw what was\nassembling on the plateau to his left. Gods! Strong gods, like Sylphrena.\nGlowing a faint blue, they clustered around a tall spren woman, who had\nlong hair streaming behind her. She had taken the shape of a person, human\nsized, and wore an elegant gown. The others swirled about in the air, though\ntheir focus was obviously the practicing bridgemen and hopefuls.\n“Uma’ami tukuma mafah’liki…” Lunamor started, hastily making the\nsigns of respect. Then, to be sure, he got down on his knees and bowed. He\nhad never seen so many in one place. Even his occasional meeting with an\nafah’liki in the Peaks did not hit him as hard as this.\nWhat was the proper offering? He could not give only bows for such a\nsight as this. But bread and stew? Mafah’liki would not want bread and\nstew."

Is this woman at their front\nyour nuatoma, ali’i’kamura?”\n“Kind of maybe sort of halfway,” she said, cocking her head. “I can\nbarely remember a voice … her voice, Phendorana, reprimanding me.

I think they assume that if they do, they’d have to admit to me\nthey were wrong.” She leaned forward, grinning. “And they absolutely hate\nbeing wrong.”\nLunamor nodded solemnly.\n“You’re not as brown as you were,” Sylphrena said.\n“Yes, my tan is fading,” Lunamor said. “Too much time indoors,\nmafah’liki.”\n“Humans can change colors?”\n“Some more than others,” Lunamor said, holding up his hand. “Some\nfrom other peaks are pale, like Shin, though my peak has always been more\nbronze.”\n“You look like somebody washed you way too much,” Sylphrena said.\n“They took a scrub brush to you, and rubbed your skin off! And that’s why\nyour hair is red, because you got so sore!”\n“These are wise words,” Lunamor said. He wasn’t sure why yet. He’d\nhave to ponder them.\nHe fished in his pocket for the spheres that he had on him, which weren’t\nmany. Still, he arranged each one in its own bowl and then approached the\nassemblage of spren.

Hobber became one man alone in a darkened place, fist glowing.\nHe stared, unblinking, at that sign of power. That sign of redemption.\nThe light in Hobber’s fist went out.\n“Ha!” Lunamor shouted. “HA!”\nHobber jumped in surprise. His jaw dropped and he stared at the now-\ndun gemstone. Then he held up his hand, gawking at the luminescent smoke\nthat rose from it. “Guys?” he called. “Guys, guys!”\nLunamor stepped back as the bridgemen left their stations and came\nrushing over. “Give him your gemstones!” Kaladin called. “He’s going to\nneed a lot!

Then the light suddenly dampened. “I can feel\nthem again!” Hobber cried. “I can feel my toes!”\nHe tentatively reached out for support. Drehy under one arm, Peet under\nthe other, Hobber slipped off his stool and stood up. He grinned with a gap-\ntoothed expression, and almost fell over—his legs obviously weren’t very\nstrong.

He seemed to be carrying the bridge all on his own, towing\nthe others.\nSkar called out a marching song, and Bridge Four thundered the words.\nBridge Four had grown strong enough to carry the bridge long distances\nwithout difficulty, but this day put those previous runs to shame.

When they reached a chasm,\nthey practically tossed the bridge across. When they picked it up on the\nother side, it seemed light as a reed.\nIt felt like they’d barely started going before they neared the source of\nthe smoke: a beleaguered caravan crossing the plains.

Lunamor\nsquinted through the smoke in the direction Kaladin was looking, and made\nout figures streaking away through the sky.\n“Voidbringer attack,” Drehy muttered. “We should have guessed they’d\nstart raiding our caravans.”\nLunamor didn’t care at the moment. He pushed his way through weary\ncaravan guards and frightened merchants hiding under wagons. There were\nbodies everywhere; the Voidbringers had killed dozens. Lunamor searched\nthrough the mess, trembling. Was that red hair on a corpse? No, that was\nblood soaking a headscarf. And that …\nThat other body wasn’t human—it had marbled skin. A brilliant white\narrow stuck from its back, fletched with goose feathers. An Unkalaki arrow.\nLunamor looked to the right, where someone had piled up furniture in a\nheap, almost like a fortification. A head poked up over the top, a stout\nwoman with a round face and a deep red braid. She stood up tall and raised\na bow toward Lunamor. Other faces peeked out from behind the furniture.\nTwo youths, a boy and a girl, both around sixteen. Younger faces from\nthere. Six in total.\nLunamor dashed toward them and found himself blubbering, tears\nstreaming down his cheeks as he crawled up the outside of their improvised\nfortification.\nHis family, at long last, had arrived at the Shattered Plains.\n* * *\n“This is Song,” Lunamor said, pulling the woman close, one arm around her\nshoulders. “Is best woman in all the Peaks. Ha! We made snow forts as\nchilds, and hers was always best. I should have known to find her in castle,\neven if it was made of old chairs!”\n“Snow?” Lopen asked. “How do you make forts out of snow? I’ve heard\nall about this stuff—it’s like frost, right?”\n“Airsick lowlander.” Lunamor shook his head, moving to the twins. He\nput one hand on each of their shoulders. “Boy is Gift. Girl is Cord. Ha!\nWhen I left, Gift was short like Skar. Now he is nearly my height!”\nHe struggled to keep the pain from his voice. It had been almost a year.\nSo long. Originally, his intent had been to bring them as soon as possible,\nbut then everything had gone wrong. Sadeas, the bridge crews …\n“Next son is Rock, but not same kind of Rock as me. This is … um …\nsmaller Rock. Third son is Star. Second daughter is Kuma’tiki—is kind of\nshell, you do not have him here. Last daughter is another Song. Beautiful\nSong.” He stooped down beside her, smiling. She was only four, and she\nshied away from him. She didn’t remember her father. It broke his heart.\nSong—Tuaka’li’na’calmi’nor—put her hand on his back. Nearby,\nKaladin introduced Bridge Four, but only Gift and Cord had been taught\nlowlander languages, and Cord spoke only Veden.

        "text": "greeting in Alethi.\nLittle Song sought her mother’s legs. Lunamor blinked away tears,\nthough they were not completely sad tears. His family was here. His first\nsaved wages had paid for the message, sent by spanreed to the Peaks\nmessage station. That station was still a week’s travel from his home, and\nfrom there, traveling down from the slopes and crossing Alethkar took\nmonths.\nAround them the caravan was finally limping into motion. This was the\nfirst chance Lunamor had found to introduce his family, as Bridge Four had\nspent the last half hour trying to help the wounded. Then, Renarin had\narrived with Adolin and two companies of troops—and for all Renarin’s\nworries about not being useful, his healing had saved several lives.\nTuaka rubbed Lunamor’s back, then knelt down beside him, pulling their\ndaughter close with one arm, Lunamor with the other. “It was a long\njourney,” she said in Unkalaki, “and longest at the end, when those things\ncame from the sky.”\n“I should have come to the warcamps,” Lunamor said. “To escort you.”\n“We’re here now,” she said. “Lunamor, what happened? Your note was\nso terse. Kef’ha is dead, but what happened to you? Why so long without\nword?”\nHe bowed his head. How could he explain this? The bridge runs, the\ncracks in his soul. How could he explain that the man she’d always said was\nso strong had wished to die? Had been a coward, had given up, near the\nend?\n“What of Tifi and Sinaku’a?” she asked him.\n“Dead,” he whispered. “They raised weapons in vengeance.”\nShe put her hand to her lips. She wore a glove on her safehand, in\ndeference to silly Vorin traditions. “Then you—”\n“I am a chef now,” Lunamor said, firm.\n“But—”\n“I cook, Tuaka.” He pulled her close again. “Come, let us take the\nchildren to safety. We will reach the tower, which you will like—it is like\nthe Peaks, almost. I will tell you stories. Some are painful.”\n“Very well. Lunamor, I have stories too. The Peaks, our home …\nsomething is wrong. Very wrong.”\nHe pulled back and met her eyes. They’d call her darkeyed down here,\nthough he found infinite depth, beauty, and light in those deep brown-green\neyes.\n“I will explain when we are safe,” she promised, picking up little\nBeautiful Song. “You are wise to usher us forward. Wise as ever.”\n“No, my love,” he whispered. “I am a fool. I would blame the air, but I\nwas a fool above too. A fool to ever let Kef’ha leave on this errand of\nstupidity.”\nShe walked the children across the bridge. He watched, and was glad to\nhear Unkalaki again, a proper language. Glad that the other men did not\nspeak it. For if they did, they might have picked out the lies that he had told\nthem.\nKaladin stepped up, clapping him on the shoulder. “I’m going to assign\nyour family my rooms, Rock.

This will light a fire under me. I’ll get us an assignment, and\nuntil then I’ll bunk with the rest of the men.”\nLunamor opened his mouth to object, then thought better of it. Some\ndays, the more honorable thing was to take a gift without complaint. “Thank\nyou,” he said. “For the rooms. For other things, my captain.”\n“Go walk with your family, Rock. We can handle the bridge without you\ntoday. We have Stormlight.”\nLunamor rested his fingers on the smooth wood. “No,” he said. “It will\nbe a privilege to carry him one last time, for my family.”\n“One last time?” Kaladin said.\n“We take to the skies, Stormblessed,” Lunamor said. “We will walk no\nmore in coming days. This is the end.” He looked back toward a subdued\nBridge Four group, who seemed to sense that what he said was true. “Ha!\nDo not look so sad. I left great stew back near city. Hobber will probably\nnot ruin it before we return. Come! Pick up our bridge. The last time, we\nmarch not toward death, but toward full stomachs and good songs!”\nDespite his urging, it was a solemn, respectful group who lifted the\nbridge. They were slaves no longer. Storms, in their pockets they carried\nriches! It glowed fiercely, and soon their skin did as well.\nKaladin took his place at the front. Together they carried the bridge on\none final run—reverently, as if it were the bier of a king, being taken to his\ntomb for his eternal rest.\n38. Broken People\nYour skills are admirable, but you are merely a man. You had your\nchance to be more, and refused it.\nDalinar entered the next vision in the middle of a fight.\nHe had learned his lesson; he didn’t intend to mire another person in an\nunexpected battle. This time he intended to find a safe point, then bring\npeople in.\nThat meant appearing as he had many months ago: holding a spear in\nsweaty hands, standing on a forlorn and broken plate of rock, surrounded by\nmen in primitive clothing. They wore wraps of rough-spun lavis fibers and\nsandals of hogshide, and carried spears with bronze heads. Only the officer\nwore armor: a mere leather jerkin, not even properly hardened. It had been\ncured, then cut roughly into the shape of a vest. It proved no help against an\naxe to the face.\nDalinar roared, indistinctly remembering his first time in this vision. It\nhad been one of the very earliest, when he still discounted them as\nnightmares. Today, he intended to tease out its secrets.\nHe charged the enemy, a group of men in similarly shoddy clothing.\nDalinar’s companions had backed themselves up to the edge of a cliff. If\nthey didn’t fight now, they’d be pushed off onto a steep incline that\neventually ended in a sheer drop and a plummet of some fifty or sixty feet\nto the bottom of a valley.\nDalinar rammed into the enemy group trying to push his men off the"

        "text": "eventually ended in a sheer drop and a plummet of some fifty or sixty feet\nto the bottom of a valley.\nDalinar rammed into the enemy group trying to push his men off the\ncliff. He wore the same clothing as the others, carried their weapons, but\nhad brought one oddity: a pouch full of gemstones tucked at his waist.\nHe gutted one enemy with his spear, then shoved the fellow toward the\nothers: thirty or so men with ragged beards and callous eyes. Two tripped\nover their dying friend, which protected Dalinar’s flank for a moment. He\nseized the fallen man’s axe, then attacked to his left.\nThe enemy resisted, howling. These men weren’t well trained, but any\nfool with a sharpened edge could be dangerous. Dalinar cut, slashed, laid\nabout himself with the axe—which was well balanced, a good weapon. He\nwas confident he could beat this group.\nTwo things went wrong. First, the other spearmen didn’t support him.\nNobody filled in behind to protect him from being surrounded.\nSecond, the wild men didn’t flinch.\nDalinar had come to rely on the way soldiers pulled away when they saw\nhim fighting. He depended on their discipline to fail—even when he hadn’t\nbeen a Shardbearer, he’d counted on his ferocity, his sheer momentum, to\nwin fights.\nTurned out, the momentum of one man—no matter how skilled or\ndetermined—amounted to little when running into a stone wall. The men\nbefore him didn’t bend, didn’t panic, didn’t so much as quiver as he killed\nfour of them. They struck at him with increased ferocity. One even laughed.\nIn a flash, his arm was chopped by an axe he didn’t even see, then he\nwas shoved over by the rush of the attackers. Dalinar hit the ground,\nstunned, looking with disbelief at the stump of his left forearm. The pain\nseemed a disconnected thing, distant. Only a single painspren, like a hand\nmade of sinew, appeared by his knees.\nDalinar felt a shattering, humbling sense of his own mortality. Was this\nwhat every veteran felt, when he finally fell on the battlefield? This bizarre,\nsurreal sense of both disbelief and long-buried resignation?\nDalinar set his jaw, then used his good hand to pull free the leather strap\nhe was using for a belt. Holding one end in his teeth, he wrapped it around\nthe stump of his arm right above the elbow. The cut wasn’t bleeding too\nbadly yet. Took a moment for a wound like this to bleed; the body\nconstricted blood flow at first.\nStorms. This blow had gone clean through. He reminded himself that this\nwasn’t his actual flesh exposed to the air. That it wasn’t his own bone there,\nlike the center ring of a hunk of pork.\nWhy not heal yourself as you did in the vision with Fen? the Stormfather\nasked. You have Stormlight.\n“Cheating,” Dalinar said with a grunt.\nCheating? the Stormfather said. Why in Damnation would that be\ncheating? You made no oath.\nDalinar smiled to hear a fragment of God cursing. He wondered if the\nStormfather was picking up bad habits from him. Ignoring the pain as best"

        "text": "cheating? You made no oath.\nDalinar smiled to hear a fragment of God cursing. He wondered if the\nStormfather was picking up bad habits from him. Ignoring the pain as best\nhe could, Dalinar seized his axe in one hand and stumbled to his feet. Ahead\nof him, his squad of twelve fought desperately—and poorly—against the\nfrantic enemy assault. They’d backed right to the edge of the cliff. With the\ntowering rock formations all around, this place almost felt like a chasm,\nthough it was considerably more open.\nDalinar wavered, and almost collapsed again. Storm it.\nJust heal yourself, the Stormfather said.\n“I used to be able to shrug off things like this.” Dalinar looked down at\nhis missing arm. Well, perhaps nothing as bad as this.\nYou’re old, the Stormfather said.\n“Maybe,” Dalinar said, steadying himself, his vision clearing. “But they\nmade a mistake.”\nWhich is?\n“They turned their backs on me.”\nDalinar charged again, wielding the axe in one hand. He dropped two of\nthe enemy, punching through to his men. “Down!” he shouted to them. “We\ncan’t fight them up here. Skid down the incline to that ledge below! We’ll\ntry to find a way to climb down from there!”\nHe jumped off the cliff and hit the incline in motion. It was a reckless\nmaneuver, but storms, they’d never survive up above. He slid down the\nstone, staying on his feet as he approached the sheer drop into the valley. A\nfinal small ledge of stone gave him a place to lurch to a stop.\nOther men slid down around him. He dropped his axe and seized one\nman, keeping him from falling all the way off the ledge to his doom. He\nmissed two others.\nIn all, seven men managed to stop around him. Dalinar puffed out,\nfeeling light-headed again, then looked down over the side of their current\nperch. At least fifty feet to the bottom of the canyon.\nHis fellows were a broken, ragged group of men, bloodied and afraid.\nExhaustionspren shot up nearby, like jets of dust. Above, the wild men\nclustered around the edge, looking down longingly, like axehounds\ncontemplating the food on the master’s table.\n“Storms!” The man Dalinar had saved slumped down. “Storms! They’re\ndead. Everyone’s dead.” He wrapped his arms around himself.\nLooking about him, Dalinar counted only one man besides himself who\nhad kept his weapon. The tourniquet he’d made was letting blood seep out.\n“We win this war,” Dalinar said softly.\nSeveral others looked to him.\n“We win. I’ve seen it. Our platoon is one of the last still fighting. While\nwe may yet fall, the war itself is being won.”\nAbove, a figure joined the wild men: a creature a good head taller than\nthe others, with fearsome carapace armor of black and red. Its eyes glowed\na deep crimson.\nYes … Dalinar remembered that creature. In this vision before, he’d\nbeen left for dead up above.

This figure had walked past: a monster from a\nnightmare, he’d assumed, dredged from his subconscious, similar to the\nbeings he fought on the Shattered Plains. Now he recognized the truth. That\nwas a Voidbringer.\nBut there had been no Everstorm in the past; the Stormfather confirmed\nthat. So where had those things come from, back during this time?\n“Form up,” Dalinar commanded. “Get ready!”\nTwo of the men listened, scrambling over to him. Honestly, two out of\nseven was more than he’d expected.\nThe cliff face shook as if something huge had struck it. And then the\nstones nearby rippled. Dalinar blinked. Was the blood loss causing his\nvision to waver? The stone face seemed to shimmer and undulate, like the\nsurface of a pond that had been disturbed.\nSomeone grabbed the rim of their ledge from below. A figure resplendent\nin Shardplate—each piece visibly glowing an amber color at its edges\ndespite the daylight—hauled itself onto their ledge. The imposing figure\nstood even larger than other men wearing Shardplate.\n“Flee,” the Shardbearer commanded. “Get your men to the healers.”\n“How?” Dalinar asked. “The cliff—”\nDalinar started. The cliff had handholds now.\nThe Shardbearer pressed his hand against the incline leading up toward\nthe Voidbringer, and again the stone seemed to writhe. Steps formed in the\nrock, as if it were made of wax that could flow and be shaped. The\nShardbearer extended his hand to the side, and a massive, glowing hammer\nappeared there.\nHe charged upward toward the Voidbringer.\nDalinar felt the rock, which was firm to his touch. He shook his head,\nthen ushered his men to start climbing down.\nThe last one looked at the stump of his arm. “How are you going to\nfollow, Malad?”\n“I’ll manage,” Dalinar said. “Go.”\nThe man left. Dalinar was growing more and more fuzzy-headed.\nFinally, he relented and drew in some Stormlight.\nHis arm regrew. First the cut healed, then the flesh expanded outward\nlike a budding plant. In moments he wriggled his fingers, awed. He’d\nshrugged off a lost arm like a stubbed toe. The Stormlight cleared his head,\nand he took a deep, refreshed breath.\nThe sounds of fighting came from above, but even craning his neck, he\ncouldn’t see much—though a body did roll down the incline, then slip off\nthe ledge.\n“Those are humans,” Dalinar said.\nObviously.\n“I never put it together before,” Dalinar said. “There were men who\nfought for the Voidbringers?”\nSome.\n“And that Shardbearer I saw? A Herald?”\nNo. Merely a Stoneward. That Surge that changed the stone is the other\nyou may learn, though it may serve you differently.\nSuch a contrast. The regular soldiers looked so primitive, but that\nSurgebinder …\nWith a shake of his head, Dalinar climbed down, using the handholds in\nthe rock face. Dalinar spotted his fellows joining a large group of soldiers\nfarther down the canyon. Shouts and whoops of joy echoed against the\nwalls from that direction.

It was as he vaguely remembered: The war had\nbeen won. Only pockets of the enemy still resisted. The larger bulk of the\narmy was starting to celebrate.\n“All right,” Dalinar said. “Bring in Navani and Jasnah.” He eventually\nplanned to show this vision to the young emperor of Azir, but first he\nwanted to prepare. “Put them somewhere close to me, please. Let them keep\ntheir own clothing.”\nNearby, two men stopped in place. A mist of glowing Stormlight\nobscured their forms, and when the mist faded, Navani and Jasnah stood\nthere, wearing havahs.\nDalinar jogged over to them. “Welcome to my madness, ladies.”\nNavani turned about, craning her neck to stare up at the tops of the\ncastle-like rock formations. She glanced toward a group of soldiers who\nlimped past, one man helping his wounded companion and calling for\nRegrowth. “Storms!” Navani whispered. “It feels so real.”\n“I did warn you,” Dalinar said. “Hopefully you don’t look too ridiculous\nback in the rooms.” Though he had become familiar enough with the\nvisions that his body no longer acted out what he was doing in them, that\nwouldn’t be so for Jasnah, Navani, or any of the monarchs he brought in.\n“What is that woman doing?” Jasnah asked, curious.\nA younger woman met the limping men. A Radiant? She had the look\nabout her, though she wasn’t armored. It was more her air of confidence, the\nway she settled them down and took something glowing from the pouch at\nher belt.\n“I remember this,” Dalinar said. “It’s one of those devices I mentioned\nfrom another vision. The ones that provide Regrowth, as they call it.\nHealing.”\nNavani’s eyes widened, and she beamed like a child who had been given\na plate full of sweets for Middlefest. She gave Dalinar a quick hug, then\nhurried over to watch. She stepped right up to the side of the group, then\nwaved impatiently for the Radiant to continue.\nJasnah turned to look around the canyon. “I know of no place in our time\nof this description, Uncle. This seems like the stormlands, from those\nformations.”\n“Maybe it’s lost somewhere in the Unclaimed Hills?”\n“That, or it’s been so long the rock formations have weathered away\ncompletely.” She narrowed her eyes at a group of people who came through\nthe canyon, carrying water to the soldiers. Last time, Dalinar had stumbled\ndown into the canyon just in time to meet them and get a drink.\nYou’re needed above, one had told him, pointing up the shallow slope\nalong the side of the canyon opposite where he had been fighting.\n“That clothing,” Jasnah said softly. “Those weapons…”\n“We’ve gone back to ancient times.”\n“Yes, Uncle,” Jasnah said. “But didn’t you tell me this vision comes at\nthe end of the Desolations?”\n“From what I remember of it, yes.”\n“So the vision with the Midnight Essence happened before this,\nchronologically.

Remember\nthe poker?”\n“I’m not likely to forget.” He rubbed his chin. “Iron and steel then, but\nmen wielding crude weapons here, of copper and bronze. As if they didn’t\nknow how to Soulcast iron, or at least not how to forge it properly, despite it\nbeing a later date. Huh. That is odd.”\n“This is confirmation of what we’ve been told, but which I could never\nquite believe. The Desolations were so terrible they destroyed learning and\nprogress and left behind a broken people.”\n“The orders of Radiants were supposed to stop that,” Dalinar said. “I\nlearned it in another vision.”\n“Yes, I read that one. All of them, actually.” She looked to him then, and\nsmiled.\nPeople were always surprised to see emotion from Jasnah, but Dalinar\nconsidered that unfair. She did smile—she merely reserved the expression\nfor when it was most genuine.\n“Thank you, Uncle,” she said. “You have given the world a grand gift. A\nman can be brave in facing down a hundred enemies, but coming into these\n—and recording them rather than hiding them—was bravery on an entirely\ndifferent level.”\n“It was mere stubbornness. I refused to believe I was mad.”\n“Then I bless your stubbornness, Uncle.” Jasnah pursed her lips in\nthought, then continued more softly. “I’m worried about you, Uncle. What\npeople are saying.”\n“You mean my heresy?” Dalinar said.\n“I’m less worried about the heresy itself, and more how you’re dealing\nwith the backlash.”\nAhead of them, Navani had somehow bullied the Radiant into letting her\nlook at the fabrial. The day was stretching toward late afternoon, the canyon\nfalling into shadow. But this vision was a long one, and he was content to\nwait upon Navani. He settled down on a rock.\n“I don’t deny God, Jasnah,” he said. “I simply believe that the being we\ncall the Almighty was never actually God.”\n“Which is the wise decision to make, considering the accounts of your\nvisions.” Jasnah settled down beside him.\n“You must be happy to hear me say that,” he said.\n“I’m happy to have someone to talk to, and I’m certainly happy to see\nyou on a journey of discovery. But am I happy to see you in pain? Am I\nhappy to see you forced to abandon something you held dear?” She shook\nher head. “I don’t mind people believing what works for them, Uncle.\nThat’s something nobody ever seems to understand—I have no stake in\ntheir beliefs. I don’t need company to be confident.”\n“How do you suffer it, Jasnah?” Dalinar said. “The things people say\nabout you? I see the lies in their eyes before they speak. Or they will tell\nme, with utter sincerity, things I have reportedly said—even though I deny\nthem. They refuse my own word against the rumors about me!”\nJasnah stared out across the canyon.

A large column of smoke rose in the\ndistance, though he couldn’t see the source.\n“I wish I had answers, Uncle,” Jasnah said softly. “Fighting makes you\nstrong, but also callous. I worry I have learned too much of the latter and\nnot enough of the former. But I can give you a warning.”\nHe looked toward her, raising his eyebrows.\n“They will try,” Jasnah said, “to define you by something you are not.\nDon’t let them. I can be a scholar, a woman, a historian, a Radiant. People\nwill still try to classify me by the thing that makes me an outsider. They\nwant, ironically, the thing I don’t do or believe to be the prime marker of my\nidentity. I have always rejected that, and will continue to do so.”\nShe reached over and put her freehand on his arm. “You are not a heretic,\nDalinar Kholin. You are a king, a Radiant, and a father. You are a man with\ncomplicated beliefs, who does not accept everything you are told. You\ndecide how you are defined. Don’t surrender that to them. They will\ngleefully take the chance to define you, if you allow it.”\nDalinar nodded slowly.\n“Regardless,” Jasnah said, standing. “This is probably not the best\noccasion for such a conversation. I realize we can replay this vision at will,\nbut the number of storms in which we can do it will be limited. I should be\nexploring.”\n“Last time, I went that way,” Dalinar said, pointing up the slope. “I’d\nlike to see what I saw again.”\n“Excellent. We’d best split to cover more ground. I will go in the other\ndirection, then we can meet afterward and compare notes.” She took off\ndown the slope toward the largest gathering of men.\nDalinar stood up and stretched, his earlier exertion still weighing on him.\nA short time later Navani returned, mumbling explanations of what she’d\nseen under her breath. Teshav sat with her in the waking world, and Kalami\nwith Jasnah, recording what they said—the only way to take notes in one of\nthese visions.\nNavani took his arm in hers and looked after Jasnah, a fond smile on her\nlips. No, none would think Jasnah emotionless if they’d witnessed that\ntearful reunion between mother and daughter.\n“How did you ever mother that one?” Dalinar asked.\n“Mostly without letting her realize she was being mothered,” Navani\nsaid. She pulled him close. “That fabrial is wonderful, Dalinar. It’s like a\nSoulcaster.”\n“In what way?”\n“In that I have no idea how it works! I think … I think something is\nwrong with the way we’ve been viewing the ancient fabrials.” He looked to\nher, and she shook her head. “I can’t explain yet.”\n“Navani…” he prodded.\n“No,” she said stubbornly. “I need to present my ideas to the scholars,\nsee if what I’m thinking even makes sense, and then prepare a report.

Though\nthere’s freedom in them, I suspect that the same information will be\nconveyed no matter what I do.”\n“So, do you want to disobey?”\nDalinar shook his head. “There are some things I need to see again—\nnow that I understand this vision is accurate, I know better questions to\nask.”\nThey started up the incline of smooth rock, walking arm in arm. Dalinar\nfelt unexpected emotions start to churn within him, partially due to Jasnah’s\nwords. But this was something deeper: a welling of gratitude, relief, even\nlove.\n“Dalinar?” Navani asked. “Are you well?”\n“I’m just … thinking,” he said, trying to keep his voice even. “Blood of\nmy fathers … it’s been nearly half a year, hasn’t it? Since all this started?\nAll that time, I came to these alone. It’s just good to share the burden,\nNavani. To be able to show this to you, and to know for once—absolutely\nand certainly—that what I’m seeing isn’t merely in my own mind.”\nShe pulled him close again, walking with her head on his shoulder. Far\nmore affectionate in public than Alethi propriety would sanction, but hadn’t\nthey thrown that out the window long ago? Besides, there was nobody to\nsee—nobody real, anyway.\nThey crested the slope, then passed several blackened patches. What\ncould burn rock like that? Other sections looked like they’d been broken by\nan impossible weight, while yet others had strangely shaped holes ripped in\nthem. Navani stopped them beside a particular formation, only knee high,\nwhere the rock rippled in a strange little symmetrical pattern. It looked like\nliquid, frozen midflow.\nCries of pain echoed through these canyons and across the open plain of\nrock. Looking out over the ridge, Dalinar found the main battlefield.\nStretching into the distance were corpses. Thousands of them, some in piles.\nOthers slaughtered in heaps while pressed against walls of stone.\n“Stormfather?” Dalinar said, addressing the spren. “This is what I told\nJasnah it was, isn’t it? Aharietiam. The Last Desolation.”\nThat is what it was called.\n“Include Navani in your responses,” Dalinar requested."

YOU SHOULD NOT DO THIS. The voice\nrumbled in the open air, and Navani jumped.\n“Aharietiam,” Dalinar said. “This isn’t how songs and paintings depict\nthe final defeat of the Voidbringers. In them, it’s always some grand\nconflict, with tremendous monsters clashing against brave lines of soldiers.”\nMEN LIE IN THEIR POETRY. SURELY YOU KNOW THIS.\n“It just … seems so like any other battlefield.”\nAND THAT ROCK BEHIND YOU?\nDalinar turned toward it, then gasped, realizing something he’d mistaken\nfor a boulder was actually a giant skeletal face. A mound of rubble they’d\npassed was actually one of those things he’d seen in a different vision. A\nstone monster that ripped its way out of the ground.\nNavani stepped up to it. “Where are the parshmen?”\n“Earlier, I fought against humans,” Dalinar said.\nTHEY WERE RECRUITED TO THE OTHER SIDE, the Stormfather said. I THINK.\n“You think?” Dalinar demanded.\nDURING THESE DAYS, HONOR STILL LIVED. I WAS NOT YET FULLY MYSELF.\nMORE OF A STORM. LESS INTERESTED IN MEN. HIS DEATH CHANGED ME. MY\nMEMORY OF THAT TIME IS DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN. BUT IF YOU WOULD SEE\nPARSHMEN, YOU NEED BUT LOOK ACROSS THAT FIELD.\nNavani joined Dalinar at the ridge, looking out over the plain of corpses\nbelow. “Which ones?” Navani asked.\nYOU CAN’T TELL?\n“Not from this distance.”\nMAYBE HALF OF THOSE ARE WHAT YOU’D CALL PARSHMEN.\nDalinar squinted, but still couldn’t make out which were human and\nwhich were not. He led Navani down the ridge, then across a plain. Here,\nthe corpses intermingled. Men in their primitive clothing. Parshmen corpses\nthat bled orange blood. This was a warning he should have recognized, but\nhadn’t been able to put together his first time in the vision. He’d thought he\nwas seeing a nightmare of their fight on the Shattered Plains.\nHe knew the path to take, one that led him and Navani across the field of\ncorpses, then into a shadowed recess beneath a tall rocky spire. The light\nhad caught on the rocks here, intriguing him. Before, he thought he’d\nwandered into this place by accident, but in truth the entire vision had\npointed him at this moment.\nHere, they found nine Shardblades rammed into the stone. Abandoned.\nNavani put her gloved safehand to her mouth at the sight—nine beautiful\nBlades, each a treasure, simply left here? Why and how?\nDalinar stepped through the shadows, rounding the nine Blades. This\nwas another image he’d misunderstood when living this vision the first\ntime. These weren’t just Shardblades.\n“Ash’s eyes,” Navani said, pointing. “I recognize that one, Dalinar. It’s\nthe one…”\n“The one that killed Gavilar,” Dalinar said, stopping beside the plainest"

They all are.”\n“This is the day that the Heralds made their final ascension to the\nTranquiline Halls!” Navani said. “To lead the battle there instead.”\nDalinar turned to the side, to where he glimpsed the air shimmering. The\nStormfather.\n“Only…” Navani said. “This wasn’t actually the end. Because the enemy\ncame back.” She walked around the ring of swords, then paused by an open\nspot in the circle. “Where is the tenth Blade?”\n“The stories are wrong, aren’t they?” Dalinar said to the Stormfather.\n“We didn’t defeat the enemy for good, as the Heralds claimed. They lied.”\nNavani’s head snapped up, her eyes focused on Dalinar.\nI LONG BLAMED THEM, the Stormfather said, FOR THEIR LACK OF HONOR. IT\nIS … DIFFICULT FOR ME TO LOOK PAST OATHS BROKEN. I HATED THEM. NOW, THE\nMORE I COME TO KNOW MEN, THE MORE I SEE HONOR IN THOSE POOR CREATURES\nYOU NAME HERALDS.\n“Tell me what happened,” Dalinar said. “What really happened?”\nARE YOU READY FOR THIS STORY? THERE ARE PARTS YOU WILL NOT LIKE.\n“If I have accepted that God is dead, I can accept the fall of his Heralds.”\nNavani settled down on a nearby stone, face pale.\nIT STARTED WITH THE CREATURES YOU NAME VOIDBRINGERS, the Stormfather\nsaid, voice rumbling and low, distant. Introspective? AS I SAID, MY VIEW OF\nTHESE EVENTS IS DISTORTED. I DO REMEMBER THAT ONCE, LONG BEFORE THE DAY\nYOU’RE SEEING NOW, THERE WERE MANY SOULS OF CREATURES WHO HAD BEEN\nSLAIN, ANGRY AND TERRIBLE. THEY HAD BEEN GIVEN GREAT POWER BY THE\nENEMY, THE ONE CALLED ODIUM. THAT WAS THE BEGINNING, THE START OF\nDESOLATIONS.\nFOR WHEN THESE DIED, THEY REFUSED TO PASS ON.\n“That’s what is happening now,” Dalinar said. “The parshmen, they’re\ntransformed by these things in the Everstorm. Those things are…” He\nswallowed. “The souls of their dead?”\nTHEY ARE THE SPREN OF PARSHMEN LONG DEAD. THEY ARE THEIR KINGS,\nTHEIR LIGHTEYES, THEIR VALIANT SOLDIERS FROM LONG, LONG AGO. THE PROCESS\nIS NOT EASY ON THEM. SOME OF THESE SPREN ARE MERE FORCES NOW,\nANIMALISTIC, FRAGMENTS OF MINDS GIVEN POWER BY ODIUM. OTHERS ARE\nMORE … AWAKE. EACH REBIRTH FURTHER INJURES THEIR MINDS.\nTHEY ARE REBORN USING THE BODIES OF PARSHMEN TO BECOME THE FUSED.\nAND EVEN BEFORE THE FUSED LEARNED TO COMMAND THE SURGES, MEN COULD\nNOT FIGHT THEM.

AS ODIUM IS SEALED BY THE POWERS OF HONOR\nAND CULTIVATION, YOUR HERALDS SEALED THE SPREN OF THE DEAD INTO THE\nPLACE YOU CALL DAMNATION. THE HERALDS WENT TO HONOR, AND HE GAVE\nTHEM THIS RIGHT, THIS OATH. THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD END THE WAR FOREVER.\nBUT THEY WERE WRONG. HONOR WAS WRONG.\n“He was like a spren himself,” Dalinar said. “You told me before—\nOdium too.”\nHONOR LET THE POWER BLIND HIM TO THE TRUTH—THAT WHILE SPREN AND\nGODS CANNOT BREAK THEIR OATHS, MEN CAN AND WILL. THE TEN HERALDS WERE\nSEALED UPON DAMNATION, TRAPPING THE VOIDBRINGERS THERE. HOWEVER, IF\nANY ONE OF THE TEN AGREED TO BEND HIS OATH AND LET VOIDBRINGERS PAST, IT\nOPENED A FLOOD. THEY COULD ALL RETURN.\n“And that started a Desolation,” Dalinar said.\nTHAT STARTED A DESOLATION, the Stormfather agreed.\nAn oath that could be bent, a pact that could be undermined. Dalinar\ncould see what had happened. It seemed so obvious. “They were tortured,\nweren’t they?”\nHORRIBLY, BY THE SPIRITS THEY TRAPPED. THEY COULD SHARE THE PAIN\nBECAUSE OF THEIR BOND—BUT EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE ALWAYS YIELDED.\nONCE ONE BROKE, ALL TEN HERALDS RETURNED TO ROSHAR. THEY FOUGHT.\nTHEY LED MEN. THEIR OATHPACT DELAYED THE FUSED FROM RETURNING\nIMMEDIATELY, BUT EACH TIME AFTER A DESOLATION, THE HERALDS RETURNED TO\nDAMNATION TO SEAL THE ENEMY AGAIN. TO HIDE, FIGHT, AND FINALLY\nWITHSTAND TOGETHER.\nTHE CYCLE REPEATED. AT FIRST THE RESPITE BETWEEN DESOLATIONS WAS\nLONG. HUNDREDS OF YEARS. NEAR THE END, DESOLATIONS CAME SEPARATED BY\nFEWER THAN TEN YEARS. THERE WAS LESS THAN ONE YEAR BETWEEN THE LAST\nTWO. THE SOULS OF THE HERALDS HAD WORN THIN. THEY BROKE ALMOST AS\nSOON AS THEY WERE CAUGHT AND TORTURED IN DAMNATION.\n“Which explains why things look so bad this time,” Navani whispered\nfrom her seat. “Society had suffered Desolation after Desolation, separated\nby short intervals. Culture, technology … all broken.”\nDalinar knelt and rubbed her shoulder.\n“It is not so bad as I feared,” she said. “The Heralds, they were\nhonorable. Perhaps not as divine, but I may even like them more, to know\nthey were once just normal men and women.”"

How could they defeat that? Dalinar looked again at that empty\nspot among the swords. “The madman, the Herald, he came to Kholinar\nwith a Shardblade. Shouldn’t that have been his Honorblade?”\nYES. BUT THE ONE DELIVERED TO YOU IS NOT IT. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT\nHAPPENED.\n“I need to speak with him. He … he was at the monastery, when we\nmarched. Wasn’t he?” Dalinar needed to ask the ardents, to see who had\nevacuated the madmen.\n“Is this what caused the Radiants to rebel?” Navani asked. “Are these\nsecrets what sparked the Recreance?”\nNO. THAT IS A DEEPER SECRET, ONE I WILL NOT SPEAK.\n“Why?” Dalinar demanded.\nBECAUSE WERE YOU TO KNOW IT, YOU WOULD ABANDON YOUR OATHS AS THE\nANCIENT RADIANTS DID.\n“I wouldn’t.”\nWOULDN’T YOU? the Stormfather demanded, his voice growing louder.\nWOULD YOU SWEAR IT?

THE REST IS IRRELEVANT.\nDalinar drew in a deep breath, but contained his anger. In a way, the\nStormfather was right. He couldn’t know how this secret would affect him\nor his Radiants.\nHe’d still rather know it. He felt as if he were walking about with a\nheadsman following, planning to claim his life at any moment.\nHe sighed as Navani stood and walked to him, taking his arm. “I’ll need\nto try to do sketches from memory of each of those Honorblades—or better,\nsend Shallan to do it.

Perhaps we can use the drawings to locate the others.”\nA shadow moved at the entrance to this little alcove, and a moment later\na young man stumbled in. He was pale of skin, with strange, wide Shin eyes\nand brown hair that had a curl to it. He could have been one of any number\nof Shin men Dalinar had seen in his own time—they were still ethnically\ndistinct, despite the passing of millennia.\nThe man fell to his knees before the wonder of the abandoned\nHonorblades. But a moment later, the man looked to Dalinar, and then\nspoke with the Almighty’s voice. “Unite them.”\n“Was there nothing you could do for the Heralds?” Dalinar asked. “Was\nthere nothing their God could do to prevent this?”\nThe Almighty, of course, couldn’t answer. He had died fighting this thing\nthey faced, the force known as Odium. He had, in a way, given his own life\nto the same cause as the Heralds.\nThe vision faded.\n39. Notes\nNo good can come of two Shards settling in one location. It was agreed\nthat we would not interfere with one another, and it disappoints me\nthat so few of the Shards have kept to this original agreement.\n“Shallan can take notes for us,” Jasnah said.\nShallan looked up from her notebook. She’d settled against the tile-\ncovered wall, sitting on the floor in her blue havah, and had intended to\nspend the meeting doing sketches.\nIt had been over a week since her recovery and subsequent meeting with\nJasnah at the crystal pillar. Shallan was feeling better and better, and at the\nsame time less and less like herself. What a surreal experience it was,\nfollowing Jasnah around as if nothing had changed.\nToday, Dalinar had called a meeting of his Radiants, and Jasnah had\nsuggested the basement rooms of the tower because they were so well\nsecured. She was incredibly worried about being spied upon.\nThe rows of dust had been removed from the library floor; Navani’s\nflock of scholars had carefully catalogued every splinter. The emptiness\nserved only to underscore the absence of the information they’d hoped to\nfind.\nNow everyone was looking at her. “Notes?” Shallan asked. She’d barely\nbeen following the conversation. “We could call for Brightness Teshav.…”\nSo far, it was a small group. The Blackthorn, Navani, and their core\nSurgebinders: Jasnah, Renarin, Shallan, and Kaladin Stormblessed, the\nflying bridgeman. Adolin and Elhokar were away, visiting Vedenar to\nsurvey the military capacities of Taravangian’s army. Malata was working\nthe Oathgate for them.\n“No need to call in another scribe,” Jasnah said. “We covered shorthand\nin your training, Shallan. I’d see how well you’ve retained the skill.

The emotion of that peeked out, but Shallan\nsmothered it, stuffing it into the back of her mind. Kaladin wasn’t to be\nblamed for that. He’d just been defending his brightlord.\nShe stood up, feeling like a chastened child. The weight of their stares\nprodded her to walk over and take a seat beside Jasnah with her pad open\nand pencil ready.\n“So,” Kaladin said. “According to the Stormfather, not only is the\nAlmighty dead, but he condemned ten people to an eternity of torture. We\ncall them Heralds, and they’re not only traitors to their oaths, they’re\nprobably also mad. We had one of them in our custody—likely the maddest\nof the lot—but we lost him in the turmoil of getting everyone to Urithiru. In\nshort, everyone who might have been able to help us is crazy, dead, a\ntraitor, or some combination of the three.” He folded his arms. “Figures.”\nJasnah glanced at Shallan. She sighed, then recorded a summary of what\nhe’d said. Even though it was already a summary.\n“So what do we do with this knowledge?” Renarin said, leaning forward\nwith his hands clasped.\n“We must curb the Voidbringer assault,” Jasnah said. “We can’t let them\nsecure too great a foothold.”\n“The parshmen aren’t our enemies,” Kaladin said softly.\nShallan glanced at him. There was something about that wavy dark hair,\nthat grim expression. Always serious, always solemn—and so tense. Like\nhe had to be strict with himself to contain his passion.\n“Of course they’re our enemies,” Jasnah said. “They’re in the process of\nconquering the world. Even if your report indicates they aren’t as\nimmediately destructive as we feared, they are still an enormous threat.”\n“They just want to live better lives,” Kaladin said.\n“I can believe,” Jasnah said, “that the common parshmen have such a\nsimple motive. But their leaders? They will pursue our extinction.”\n“Agreed,” Navani said. “They were born out of a twisted thirst to destroy\nhumankind.”\n“The parshmen are the key,” Jasnah said, shuffling through some pages\nof notes. “Looking over what you discovered, it seems that all parshmen\ncan bond with ordinary spren as part of their natural life cycle. What we’ve\nbeen calling ‘Voidbringers’ are instead a combination of a parshman with\nsome kind of hostile spren or spirit.”\n“The Fused,” Dalinar said.\n“Great,” Kaladin said. “Fine. Let’s fight them, then. Why do the common\nfolk have to get crushed in the process?”\n“Perhaps,” Jasnah said, “you should visit my uncle’s vision and see for\nyourself the consequences of a soft heart. Firsthand witness of a Desolation\nmight change your perspective.”\n“I’ve seen war, Brightness. I’m a soldier. Problem is, Ideals have\nexpanded my focus.

Do you honestly see a chance for an accommodation here?”\n“I … I don’t know, sir. Even the common parshmen are furious at what\nwas done to them.”\n“I can’t afford to stay my hand from war,” Dalinar said. “Everything you\nsay is right, but it is also nothing new. I have never gone to battle where\nsome poor fools on either side—men who didn’t want to be there in the first\nplace—weren’t going to bear the brunt of the pain.”\n“Maybe,” Kaladin said, “that should make you reconsider those other\nwars, rather than using them to justify this one.”\nShallan’s breath caught. It didn’t seem the sort of thing you said to the\nBlackthorn.\n“Would that it were so simple, Captain.” Dalinar sighed loudly,\nlooking … weathered to Shallan. “Let me say this: If we can be certain of\none thing, it is the morality of defending our homeland. I don’t ask you to\ngo to war idly, but I will ask you to protect. Alethkar is besieged. The men\ndoing it might be innocents, but they are controlled by those who are evil.”\nKaladin nodded slowly. “The king has asked my help in opening the\nOathgate. I’ve agreed to give it to him.”\n“Once we secure our homeland,” Dalinar said, “I promise to do\nsomething I’d never have contemplated before hearing your reports. I’ll\nseek to negotiate; I’ll see if there is some way out of this that doesn’t\ninvolve smashing our armies together.”\n“Negotiate?” Jasnah said. “Uncle, these creatures are crafty, ancient, and\nangry. They spent millennia torturing the Heralds just to return and seek our\ndestruction.”\n“We’ll see,” Dalinar said. “Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to contact\nanyone in the city with the visions. The Stormfather has found Kholinar to\nbe a ‘dark spot’ to him.”\nNavani nodded. “That seems, unfortunately, to coordinate with the\nfailure of the spanreeds in the city. Captain Kaladin’s report confirms what\nour last notes from the city said: The enemy is mobilizing for an assault on\nthe capital. We can’t know what the city’s status will be once our strike\nforce arrives. You might have to infiltrate an occupied city, Captain.”\n“Please send that it isn’t so,” Renarin whispered, eyes down. “How\nmany would have died on those walls, fighting nightmares…”\n“We need more information,” Jasnah said. “Captain Kaladin, how many\npeople can you take with you to Alethkar?”\n“I plan to fly at the front of a storm,” Kaladin said. “Like I did returning\nto Urithiru. It’s a bumpy ride, but maybe I can fly over the top of the winds.\nI need to test it. Anyway, I think I could bring a small group.”"

Anyway, I think I could bring a small group.”\n“You won’t need a large force,” Dalinar said. “You, a few of your best\nsquires. I’d send Adolin with you too, so you have another Shardbearer in\nan emergency. Six, perhaps? You, three of your men, the king, Adolin. Get\npast the enemy, sneak into the palace, and activate the Oathgate.”\n“Pardon if this is out of line,” Kaladin said, “but Elhokar himself is the\nodd one. Why not just send me and Adolin? The king will probably slow us\ndown.”\n“The king needs to go for personal reasons. Will there be a problem\nbetween you?”\n“I’ll do what is right, regardless of my feelings, sir. And … I might be\nbeyond those feelings anyway, now.”\n“This is too small,” Jasnah mumbled.\nShallan started, then glanced at her. “Too small?”\n“Not ambitious enough,” Jasnah said more firmly. “By the Stormfather’s\nexplanation, the Fused are immortal. Nothing stops their rebirth now that\nthe Heralds have failed. This is our real problem. Our enemy has a near-\nendless supply of parshman bodies to inhabit, and judging by what the good\ncaptain has confirmed through experience, these Fused can access some\nkind of Surgebinding. How do we fight against that?”\nShallan looked up from her notepad, glancing toward the others in the\nroom. Renarin still leaned forward, hands clasped, eyes on the floor. Navani\nand Dalinar were sharing a look. Kaladin continued to lean against the wall,\narms folded, but he shifted his posture, uncomfortable.\n“Well,” Dalinar finally said. “We’ll have to take this one goal at a time.\nFirst Kholinar.”\n“Pardon, Uncle,” Jasnah said. “While I don’t disagree with that first step,\nnow is not the time to think only of the immediate future. If we are to avoid\na Desolation that breaks society, then we’ll need to use the past as our guide\nand make a plan.”\n“She’s right,” Renarin whispered. “We’re facing something that killed\nthe Almighty himself. We fight terrors that break the minds of men and ruin\ntheir souls. We can’t think small.” He ran his hands through his hair, which\nwas marked by less yellow than his brother’s. “Almighty. We have to think\nbig—but can we take it all in without going mad ourselves?”\nDalinar took a deep breath. “Jasnah, you have a suggestion of where to\nstart this plan?”\n“Yes. The answer is obvious. We need to find the Heralds.”\nKaladin nodded in agreement.\n“Then,” Jasnah added, “we need to kill them.”\n“What?” Kaladin demanded. “Woman, are you insane?”\n“The Stormfather laid it out,” Jasnah said, unperturbed. “The Heralds\nmade a pact. When they died, their souls traveled to Damnation and trapped\nthe spirits of the Voidbringers, preventing them from returning.”\n“Yeah. Then the Heralds were tortured until they broke.”"

Then the Heralds were tortured until they broke.”\n“The Stormfather said their pact was weakened, but did not say it was\ndestroyed,” Jasnah said. “I suggest that we at least see if one of them is\nwilling to return to Damnation. Perhaps they can still prevent the spirits of\nthe enemy from being reborn. It’s either that, or we completely exterminate\nthe parshmen so that the enemy has no hosts.” She met Kaladin’s eyes. “In\nthe face of such an atrocity, I would consider the sacrifice of one or more\nHeralds to be a small price.”\n“Storms!” Kaladin said, standing up straight. “Have you no sympathy?”\n“I have plenty, bridgeman. Fortunately, I temper it with logic. Perhaps\nyou should consider acquiring some at a future date.”\n“Listen, Brightness,” Kaladin began. “I—”\n“Enough, Captain,” Dalinar said. He gave Jasnah a glance. Both fell\nquiet, Jasnah without so much as a peep. Shallan had never seen her\nrespond to someone with the respect she gave Dalinar.\n“Jasnah,” Dalinar said. “Even if the pact of the Heralds still holds, we\ncan’t know that they’d stay in Damnation—or the mechanics for locking\naway the Voidbringers there. That said, locating them seems like an\nexcellent first step; they must know much that can greatly assist us. I will\nleave it to you, Jasnah, to plan out how to accomplish that.”\n“What … what of the Unmade?” Renarin said. “There will be others,\nlike the creature we found down here.”\n“Navani has been researching them,” Dalinar said.\n“We need to go even farther, Uncle,” Jasnah said. “We need to watch the\nmovements of the Voidbringers. Our only hope is to defeat their armies so\nsoundly that even if their leaders are constantly reborn, they lack the\nmanpower to overwhelm us.”\n“Protecting Alethkar,” Kaladin said, “doesn’t have to mean completely\ncrushing the parshmen and—”\n“If you wish, Captain,” Jasnah snapped, “I can get you some mink kits to\ncuddle while the adults plan. None of us want to talk about this, but that\ndoes not make it any less inevitable.”\n“I’d love that,” Kaladin responded. “In turn, I’ll get you some eels to\ncuddle. You’ll feel right at home.”\nJasnah, curiously, smiled. “Let me ask this, Captain. Do you think\nignoring the movement of Voidbringer troops would be wise?”\n“Probably not,” he admitted.\n“And do you think, perhaps, that you could train your squire\nWindrunners to fly up high and scout for us? If spanreeds are proving\nunreliable these days, we’ll need another method of watching the enemy.\nI’d happily cuddle skyeels, as you offer, if your team would be willing to\nspend some time imitating them.”\nKaladin looked to Dalinar, who nodded appreciatively.\n“Excellent,” Jasnah said. “Uncle, your coalition of monarchs is a superb"

We need to pen the enemy in and prevent them from overrunning all\nof Roshar. If…”\nShe trailed off. Shallan paused, looking at the doodle she’d been doing.\nActually, it was a bit more complex than a doodle. It was … kind of a full\nsketch of Kaladin’s face, with passionate eyes and a determined expression.\nJasnah had noticed a creationspren in the form of a small gemstone that had\nappeared on the top of her page, and Shallan blushed, shooing it away.\n“Perhaps,” Jasnah said, glancing at Shallan’s sketchbook, “we could do\nwith a short break, Uncle.”\n“If you wish,” he said. “I could use something to drink.”\nThey broke up, Dalinar and Navani chatting softly as they went to check\nwith the guards and servants in the main hallway. Shallan watched them go\nwith a sense of longing, as she felt Jasnah loom over her.\n“Let us chat,” Jasnah said, nodding toward the far end of the long,\nrectangular room.\nShallan sighed, closed her notebook, and followed Jasnah to the other\nend, near a pattern of tiles on the wall. This far from the spheres brought for\nthe meeting, the lighting was dim.\n“May I?” Jasnah said, holding out her hand for Shallan’s notebook.\nShe relinquished it.\n“A fine depiction of the young captain,” Jasnah said. “I see … three lines\nof notes here? After you were pointedly instructed to take the minutes.”\n“We should have sent for a scribe.”\n“We had a scribe. To take notes is not a lowly task, Shallan. It is a\nservice you can provide.”\n“If it’s not a lowly task,” Shallan said, “then perhaps you should have\ndone it.”\nJasnah closed the sketchpad and fixed Shallan with a calm, level stare.\nThe type that made Shallan squirm.\n“I remember,” Jasnah said, “a nervous, desperate young woman. Frantic\nto earn my goodwill.”\nShallan didn’t reply.\n“I understand,” Jasnah said, “that you have enjoyed independence. What\nyou accomplished here is remarkable, Shallan. You even seem to have\nearned my uncle’s trust—a challenging task.”\n“Then maybe we can just call the wardship finished, eh?” Shallan said.\n“I mean, I’m a full Radiant now.”\n“Radiant, yes,” Jasnah said. “Full? Where’s your armor?”\n“Um … armor?”\nJasnah sighed softly, opening up the sketchpad again. “Shallan,” she said\nin a strangely … comforting tone. “I’m impressed. I am impressed, truly.\nBut what I’ve heard of you recently is troubling. You’ve ingratiated yourself\nwith my family, and made good on the causal betrothal to Adolin. Yet here\nyou are with wandering eyes, as this sketch testifies.”\n“I—”\n“You skip meetings that Dalinar calls,” Jasnah continued, soft but\nimmovable. “When you do go, you sit at the back and barely pay attention."

Yet you never explained how you found it\nwhen Dalinar’s soldiers could not.” She met Shallan’s eyes. “You’ve always\nhidden things from me. Some of those secrets were very damaging, and I\nfind myself unwilling to believe you don’t have others.”\nShallan bit her lip, but nodded.\n“That was an invitation,” Jasnah said, “to talk to me.”\nShallan nodded again. She wasn’t working with the Ghostbloods. That\nwas Veil. And Jasnah didn’t need to know about Veil. Jasnah couldn’t know\nabout Veil.\n“Very well,” Jasnah said with a sigh. “Your wardship is not finished, and\nwon’t be until I’m convinced that you can meet minimum requirements of\nscholarship—such as taking shorthand notes during an important\nconference. Your path as a Radiant is another matter. I don’t know that I can\nguide you; each order was distinctive in its approach. But as a young man\nwill not be excused from his geography lessons simply because he has\nachieved competence with the sword, I will not release you from your\nduties to me simply because you have discovered your powers as a\nRadiant.”\nJasnah handed back the sketchpad and walked toward the ring of chairs.\nShe settled next to Renarin, prodding him gently to speak with her. He\nlooked up for the first time since the meeting had begun and nodded, saying\nsomething Shallan couldn’t hear.\n“Mmmm…” Pattern said. “She is wise.”\n“That’s perhaps her most infuriating feature,” Shallan said. “Storms. She\nmakes me feel like a child.”\n“Mmm.”\n“Worst part is, she’s probably right,” Shallan said. “Around her, I do act\nmore like a child. It’s like part of me wants to let her take care of\neverything. And I hate, hate, hate that about myself.”\n“Is there a solution?”\n“I don’t know.”\n“Perhaps … act like an adult?”\nShallan put her hands to her face, groaning softly and rubbing her eyes\nwith her fingers. She’d basically asked for that, hadn’t she? “Come on,” she\nsaid, “let’s go to the rest of the meeting. As much as I want an excuse to get\nout of here.”\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “Something about this room…”\n“What?” Shallan asked.\n“Something…” Pattern said in his buzzing way. “It has memories,\nShallan.”\nMemories. Did he mean in Shadesmar? She’d avoided traveling there—\nthat was at least one thing in which she’d listened to Jasnah.\nShe made her way back to her seat, and after a moment’s thought,\nslipped Jasnah a quick note. Pattern says this room has memories. Worth\ninvestigating in Shadesmar?\nJasnah regarded the note, then wrote back.\nI’ve found that we should not ignore the offhand comments of our spren."

Thank you for the suggestion.\nThe meeting started again, and now turned to discussion of specific\nkingdoms around Roshar. Jasnah was most keen on getting the Shin to join\nthem. The Shattered Plains held the easternmost of the Oathgates, and that\nwas already under Alethi control. If they could gain access to the one\nfarthest to the west, they could travel the breadth of Roshar—from the entry\npoint of the highstorms to the entry point of the Everstorms—in a heartbeat.\nThey didn’t talk tactics too specifically; that was a masculine art, and\nDalinar would want his highprinces and generals to discuss the battlefields.\nStill, Shallan didn’t fail to notice the tactical terms Jasnah used now and\nthen.\nIn things like this, Shallan had difficulty understanding the woman. In\nsome ways, Jasnah seemed fiercely masculine. She studied whatever she\npleased, and she talked tactics as easily as she talked poetry. She could be\naggressive, even cold—Shallan had seen her straight-up execute thieves\nwho had tried to rob her. Beyond that … well, it probably was best not to\nspeculate on things with no meaning, but people did talk. Jasnah had turned\ndown every suitor for her hand, including some very attractive and\ninfluential men. People wondered. Was she perhaps simply not interested?\nAll of this should have resulted in a person who was decidedly\nunfeminine. Yet Jasnah wore the finest makeup, and wore it well, with\nshadowed eyes and bright red lips. She kept her safehand covered, and\npreferred intricate and fetching styles of braids from her hairdresser. Her\nwritings and her mind made her the very model of Vorin femininity.\nNext to Jasnah, Shallan felt pale, stupid, and completely lacking in\ncurves. What would it be like, to be so confident? So beautiful, yet so\nunconstrained, all at once? Surely, Jasnah Kholin had far fewer problems in\nlife than Shallan. At the very least, she created far fewer for herself than\nShallan did.\nIt was about this point that Shallan realized she’d missed a good fifteen\nminutes of the meeting, and had again lapsed in her note-taking. Blushing\nfuriously, she huddled up on her chair and did her best to remain focused\nfor the rest of the meeting. At the end, she presented a sheet of formal\nshorthand to Jasnah.\nThe woman looked it over, then cocked a perfectly shaped eyebrow at\nthe line at the center where Shallan had grown distracted. Dalinar said\nsome stuff here, the line read. It was very important and useful, so I’m sure\nyou remember it without needing a reminder.\nShallan smiled apologetically and shrugged.\n“Please write this out in longhand,” Jasnah said, handing it back. “Have\na copy sent to my mother and to my brother’s head scribe.”\nShallan took it as a dismissal and rushed away. She felt like a student\nwho had just been released from lessons, which angered her. At the same\ntime, she wanted to run off and immediately do as Jasnah had asked, to"

At the same\ntime, she wanted to run off and immediately do as Jasnah had asked, to\nrenew her mistress’s faith in her, which angered her even more.\nShe ran up the steps out of the tower’s basement, using Stormlight to\nprevent fatigue. The different sides within her clashed, snapping at each\nother. She imagined months spent under Jasnah’s watchful care, training to\nbecome a mousy scribe as her father had always wanted.\nShe remembered the days in Kharbranth, when she’d been so uncertain,\nso timid. She couldn’t return to that. She wouldn’t. But what to do instead?\nWhen she finally reached her rooms, Pattern was buzzing at her. She\ntossed aside her sketchpad and satchel, digging out Veil’s coat and hat. Veil\nwould know what to do.\nHowever, pinned to the inside of Veil’s coat was a sheet of paper. Shallan\nfroze, then looked around the room, suddenly anxious. Hesitantly, she\nunpinned the sheet and unfolded it.\nThe top read:\nYou have accomplished the task we set out for you. You have investigated the\nUnmade, and not only learned something of it, but also frightened it away. As promised,\nhere is your reward.\nThe following letter explains the truth about your deceased brother, Nan Helaran,\nacolyte of the Radiant order of the Skybreakers.\n40. Questions, Peeks, and Inferences\nAs for Uli Da, it was obvious from the outset that she was going to be a\nproblem. Good riddance.\nThere are at least two major institutions on Roshar, other than ourselves,\nwhich presaged the return of the Voidbringers and the Desolations, the\nletter read.\nYou are familiar with the first of these, the men who call themselves the Sons of Honor.\nThe old king of Alethkar—the Blackthorn’s brother, Gavilar Kholin—was a driving force\nin their expansion. He brought Meridas Amaram into their fold.\nAs you no doubt discovered upon infiltrating Amaram’s mansion in the warcamps,\nthe Sons of Honor explicitly worked for the return of the Desolations. They believed that\nonly the Voidbringers would cause the Heralds to show themselves—and they believed\nthat a Desolation would restore both the Knights Radiant and the classical strength of\nthe Vorin church. King Gavilar’s efforts to rekindle the Desolations are likely the true\nreason he was assassinated. Though there were many in the palace that night who had\nreason to see him dead.\nA second group who knew the Desolations might return are the Skybreakers. Led by\nthe ancient Herald Nalan’Elin—often simply called Nale—the Skybreakers are the only\norder of Radiants that did not betray its oaths during the Recreance. They have\nmaintained a continuous clandestine line from ancient days.\nNale believed that men speaking the Words of other orders would hasten the return\nof the Voidbringers. We do not know how this could possibly be true, but as a Herald,\nNale has access to knowledge and understanding beyond us.\nYou should know that the Heralds are no longer to be seen as allies to man.

Those\nthat are not completely insane have been broken. Nale himself is ruthless, without pity\nor mercy. He has spent the last two decades—perhaps much longer—dealing with\nanyone close to bonding a spren. Sometimes he recruited these people, bonding them\nto highspren and making them Skybreakers. Others he eliminated. If the person had\nalready bonded a spren, then Nale usually went in person to dispatch them. If not, he\nsent a minion.\nA minion like your brother Helaran.\nYour mother had intimate contact with a Skybreaker acolyte, and you know the result\nof that relationship. Your brother was recruited because Nale was impressed with him.\nNale may also have learned, through means we do not understand, that a member of\nyour house was close to bonding a spren. If this is true, they came to believe that\nHelaran was the one they wanted. They recruited him with displays of great power and\nShards.\nHelaran had not yet proved himself worthy of a spren bond. Nale is exacting with his\nrecruits. Likely, Helaran was sent to kill Amaram as a test—either that or he took it upon\nhimself as a way of proving his worthiness for knighthood.\nIt is also possible that the Skybreakers knew someone in Amaram’s army was close\nto bonding a spren, but I believe it likelier that the attack on Amaram was simply a\nstrike against the Sons of Honor. From our spying upon the Skybreakers, we have\nrecords showing the only member of Amaram’s army to have bonded a spren was long\nsince eliminated.\nThe bridgeman was not, so far as we understand, known to them. If he had been, he\nwould certainly have been killed during his months as a slave.\nIt ended there. Shallan sat in her room, lit only by the faintest sphere.\nHelaran, a Skybreaker? And King Gavilar, working with Amaram to bring\nback the Desolations?\nPattern buzzed with concern on her skirts and moved up onto the page,\nreading the letter. She whispered the words again to herself, to memorize\nthem, for she knew she couldn’t keep this letter. It was too dangerous.\n“Secrets,” Pattern said. “There are lies in this letter.”\nSo many questions. Who else had been there on the night Gavilar had\ndied, as the letter hinted? And what about this reference to another\nSurgebinder in Amaram’s army? “He’s dangling tidbits in front of me,”\nShallan said. “Like a man on the docks who has a trained kurl that will\ndance and wave its arms for fish.”\n“But … we want those tidbits, don’t we?”\n“That’s why it works.” Storm it.\nShe couldn’t deal with this at the moment. She took a Memory of the\npage. It wasn’t a particularly efficient method in regards to text, but it\nwould work in a pinch. Then she stuffed the letter in a basin of water and\nwashed off the ink, before shredding it and wadding it into a ball.\nFrom there, she changed into her coat, trousers, and hat, and snuck from\nthe rooms as Veil.\n* * *"

Though this was for Sebarial’s soldiers, she saw men in blue\nuniforms as well—Dalinar had ordered his men to spend time with the\nsoldiers of his allies, to help foster a sense of comradery.\nVeil’s entrance drew glances, but not stares. Women were allowed in\nsuch common rooms, though few came. Little sounded less appealing to a\nwoman being courted than, “Hey, let’s go sit in the barracks common room\nand watch men grunt and scratch themselves.”\nShe sauntered over to where Vathah and his men had set up at a round\nwooden table. Furniture was finally trickling down to the ordinary men;\nShallan even had a bed now. Veil settled down in a seat and leaned back,\ntipping the chair so it clicked against the stone wall. This large common\nroom reminded her of a wine cellar. Dark, unadorned, and filled with a\nvariety of unusual stenches.\n“Veil,” Vathah said, nodding to her. Four of them were playing at this\ntable: Vathah, one-eyed Gaz, lanky Red, and Shob. The latter wore a\nglyphward wrapped around one arm and sniffled periodically.\nVeil leaned her head back. “I seriously need something to drink.”\n“I’ve got an extra mug or two on my ration,” Red said cheerfully.\nVeil eyed him to see if he was hitting on her again. He was smiling, but\notherwise didn’t seem to be making a pass. “Right kind of you, Red,” Veil\nsaid, digging out a few chips and tossing them to him. He tossed over his\nrequisition chit, a little piece of metal with his number stamped on it.\nA short time later she was back in her place, nursing some lavis beer.\n“Tough day?” Vathah said, lining up his pieces. The small stone bricks\nwere about the size of a thumb, and the men each had ten of them that they\narranged facedown. The betting started soon after. Apparently, Vathah was\nthe mink for this round.\n“Yeah,” she replied. “Shallan’s been an even bigger pain than usual.”\nThe men grunted.\n“It’s like she can’t decide who she is, you know?” Veil continued. “One\nmoment she’s cracking jokes like she’s sitting in a knitting circle with old\nladies—the next she’s staring at you with that hollow gaze. The one that\nmakes you think her soul has gone vacant…”\n“She’s a strange one, our mistress,” Vathah agreed.\n“Makes you want to do things,” Gaz said with a grunt. “Things you\nnever thought you’d do.”\n“Yeah,” Glurv said from the next table over. “I got a medal. Me. For\nhelping find that mess hiding in the basement. Old Kholin himself sent it\ndown for me.” The overweight soldier shook his head, bemused—but he\nwas wearing the medal. Pinned right to his collar."

Pinned right to his collar.\n“It was fun,” Gaz admitted. “Going out carousing, but feeling like we\nwere doing something. That’s what she promised us, you know? Making a\ndifference again.”\n“The difference I want to make,” Vathah said, “is filling my pouch with\nyour spheres. You men betting or not?”\nThe four players all tossed in some spheres. Pieces was one of those\ngames that the Vorin church grudgingly allowed, as it involved no\nrandomization. Dice, drawing from a deck of cards, even shuffling up the\npieces—betting on such things was like trying to guess the future. And that\nwas so deeply wrong, thinking of it made Veil’s skin crawl. She wasn’t even\nparticularly religious, not like Shallan was.\nPeople wouldn’t play games like those in the official barracks. Here, they\nplayed guessing games. Vathah had arranged nine of his pieces in a triangle\nshape; the tenth one he set to the side and flipped over as the seed. It, like\nthe hidden nine, was marked with the symbol of one of the Alethi\nprincedoms. In this case, the seed was Aladar’s symbol, in the form of a\nchull.\nThe goal was to arrange your ten pieces in a pattern identical to his, even\nthough they were facedown. You’d guess which were which through a\nseries of questions, peeks, and inferences. You could force the mink to\nreveal pieces just to you, or to everyone, based on certain other rules.\nIn the end, someone called and everyone flipped over their pieces. The\none with the most matches to the mink’s pattern was declared winner, and\nclaimed the pot. The mink got a percentage, based on certain factors, such\nas the number of turns it took before someone called.\n“What do you think?” Gaz asked, as he tossed a few chips into the bowl\nat the center, buying the right to peek at one of Vathah’s tiles. “How long\nwill Shallan go this time before she remembers we’re here?”\n“Long time, I hope,” Shob said. “Oi think Oi might be comin’ down with\nsomethin’.”\n“So all is normal, Shob,” Red said.\n“It’s big this time,” Shob said. “Oi think Oi might be turnin’ into a\nVoidbringer.”\n“A Voidbringer,” Veil said flatly.\n“Yeah, look at this rash.” He pulled back the glyphward, exposing his\nupper arm. Which looked perfectly normal.\nVathah snorted.\n“Eh!” Shob said. “Oi’m likely to die, Sarge. You mark me, Oi’m likely\nto die.” He moved around a few of his tiles. “If Oi do, give my winnings to\ndem orphans.”\n“Them orphans?” Red asked.\n“You know, orphans.” Shob scratched his head. “There’s orphans, right?\nSomewhere? Orphans that need food? Give them mine after I die.”\n“Shob,” Vathah said, “with the way justice plays out in this world, I can\nguarantee you’ll outlive the rest of us.”"

Don’t do it yet! I don’t even\nhave two lines!”\n“Too late,” Shob said.\nRed and Gaz reluctantly started flipping their tiles.\n“Sadeas,” Shallan said absently. “Bethab, Ruthar, Roion, Thanadal,\nKholin, Sebarial, Vamah, Hatham. With Aladar as the seed.”\nVathah gaped at her, then flipped the tiles over, revealing them exactly as\nshe’d said. “And you didn’t even get any peeks … Storms, woman. Remind\nme never to play pieces with you.”\n“My brothers always said the same thing,” she said as he split the pot\nwith Shob, who had gotten them all right but three.\n“Another hand?” Gaz asked.\nEveryone looked at his bowl of spheres, which was almost empty.\n“I can get a loan,” he said quickly. “There’s some fellows in Dalinar’s\nguard who said—”\n“Gaz,” Vathah said.\n“But—”\n“Seriously, Gaz.”\nGaz sighed. “Guess we can play for ends, then,” he said, and Shob\neagerly got out some drops of glass shaped roughly like spheres, but\nwithout gemstones at the center. Fake money for gambling without stakes.\nVeil was enjoying her mug of beer more than she’d expected. It was\nrefreshing to sit here with these men and not have to worry about all\nShallan’s problems. Couldn’t that girl just relax? Let it all blow past her?\nNearby some washwomen entered, calling that laundry pickup would be\nin a few minutes. Vathah and his men didn’t stir—though by Veil’s\nestimation, the very clothing they were wearing could use a good scrub.\nUnfortunately, Veil couldn’t completely ignore Shallan’s problems.\nMraize’s note proved how useful he could be, but she had to be careful. He\nobviously wanted a mole among the Knights Radiant. I need to turn this\naround on him. Learn what he knows. He’d told her what the Skybreakers\nand the Sons of Honor had been up to. But what about Mraize and his\ncohorts? What was their objective?\nStorms, did she dare try to double-cross him? Did she really have the\nexperience, or the training, to attempt something like that?\n“Hey, Veil,” Vathah said as they prepped for another game. “What do\nyou think? Has the brightness already forgotten about us again?”\nVeil shook herself out of her thoughts. “Maybe. She doesn’t seem to\nknow what to do with you lot.”\n“She’s not the first,” Red said—he was the next mink, and carefully\narranged his tiles in a specific order, facedown. “I mean, it’s not like we’re\nreal soldiers.”\n“Our crimes are forgiven,” Gaz said with a grunt, squinting his single\neye at the seed tile that Red turned over. “But forgiven ain’t forgotten.

If I’d been\na little less hard on them, do you think maybe I’d be out on that plateau\nright now, practicing like the lot of them do? Learning to fly…”\n“You think you could be a Knight Radiant, Gaz?” Vathah said,\nchuckling.\n“No. No, I guess I don’t.” He eyed Veil. “Veil, you tell the brightness.\nWe ain’t good men. Good men, they’ll find something useful to do with\ntheir time. We, on the other hand, might do the opposite.”\n“The opposite?” Zendid said from the next table over, where a few of the\nothers continued to drink. “Opposite of useful? I think we’re already there,\nGaz. And we’ve been there forever.”\n“Not me,” Glurv said. “I’ve got a medal.”\n“I mean,” Gaz said, “we might get into trouble. I liked being useful.\nReminded me of back when I first joined up. You tell her, Veil. Tell her to\ngive us something to do other than gambling and drinking. Because to be\nhonest, I ain’t very good at either one.”\nVeil nodded slowly. A washwoman idled by, messing with a sack of\nlaundry. Veil tapped her finger on her cup. Then she stood and seized the\nwashwoman by the dress and hauled her backward. The woman shouted,\ndropping her pile of clothing as she stumbled, nearly falling.\nVeil shoved her hand into the woman’s hair, pushing away the wig of\nmottled brown and black. Underneath, the woman’s hair was pure Alethi\nblack, and she wore ashes on her cheeks, as if she’d been doing hard labor.\n“You!” Veil said. This was the woman from the tavern at All’s Alley.\nWhat had her name been? Ishnah?\nSeveral nearby soldiers had leapt up with alarmed expressions at the\nwoman’s outcry. Every one of those is a soldier from Dalinar’s army, Veil\nnoted, suppressing a roll of her eyes. Kholin troops did have a habit of\nassuming that nobody could take care of themselves.\n“Sit,” Veil said, pointing at the table. Red hastily pulled up another chair.\nIshnah settled herself, holding the wig to her chest. She blushed deeply,\nbut maintained some measure of poise, meeting the eyes of Vathah and his\nmen.\n“You are getting to be an annoyance, woman,” Veil said, sitting.\n“Why do you assume I’m here because of you?” Ishnah said. “You’re"

Now I find\nyou in disguise, eavesdropping on my conversations?”\nIshnah raised her chin. “Maybe I’m just trying to prove myself to you.”\n“With a disguise I saw through the moment I glanced at you?”\n“You didn’t catch me last time,” Ishnah said.\nLast time?\n“You talked about where to get Horneater lager,” Ishnah said. “Red\ninsisted it was nasty. Gaz loves it.”\n“Storms. How long have you been spying on me?”\n“Not long,” Ishnah said quickly, in direct contradiction to what she’d just\nsaid. “But I can assure you, promise it, that I’ll be more valuable to you\nthan these rancid buffoons. Please, at least let me try.”\n“Buffoons?” Gaz said.\n“Rancid?” Shob said. “Oh, that’s just moi boils, miss.”\n“Walk with me,” Veil said, standing up. She strode away from the table.\nIshnah scrambled to her feet and followed. “I wasn’t really trying to spy\non you. But how else was I—”\n“Quiet,” Veil said. She stopped at the doorway to the barracks, far\nenough from her men that they couldn’t hear. She folded her arms, leaning\nagainst the wall by the door and looking back at them.\nShallan had trouble with follow-through. She had good intentions and\ngrand plans, but she got diverted too easily by new problems, new\nadventures. Fortunately, Veil could pick up a few of those loose threads.\nThese men had proven that they were loyal, and they wanted to be\nuseful. A woman could be given much less than that to work with.\n“The disguise was well done,” she said to Ishnah. “Next time, rough up\nyour freehand some more. The fingers gave you away; they aren’t the\nfingers of a laborer.”\nIshnah blushed, balling her freehand into a fist.\n“Tell me what you can do, and why I should care,” Veil said. “You have\ntwo minutes.”\n“I…” Ishnah took a deep breath. “I was trained as a spy for House\nHamaradin. In Vamah’s court? I know information gathering, message\ncoding, observation techniques, and how to search a room without revealing\nwhat I’ve done.”\n“So? If you’re so useful, what happened?”\n“Your people happened. The Ghostbloods. I’d heard of them, whispered\nof by Brightlady Hamaradin. She crossed them somehow, and then…” She\nshrugged. “She ended up dead, and everyone thought it might have been\none of us who did it. I fled and ended up in the underground, working for a\npetty gang of thieves. But I could be so much more. Let me prove it to\nyou.”\nVeil crossed her arms. A spy. That could be useful.

Right now, she didn’t even know what\nit was she didn’t know.\nCould she get some of that from Ishnah? Somehow get some training\nwithout revealing that Veil wasn’t as skilled as she pretended to be?\nAn idea began to take form. She didn’t trust this woman, but then she\ndidn’t need to. And if her former brightlady really had been killed by the\nGhostbloods, perhaps there was a secret to learn there.\n“I have some important infiltrations planned,” Veil said. “Missions where\nI need to gather information of a sensitive nature.”\n“I can help!” Ishnah said.\n“What I really need is a support team, so I don’t have to go in alone.”\n“I can find people for you! Experts.”\n“I wouldn’t be able to trust them,” Veil said, shaking her head. “I need\nsomeone I know is loyal.”\n“Who?”\nVeil pointed at Vathah and his men.\nIshnah’s expression fell. “You want to turn those men into spies?”\n“That, and I want you to prove to me what you can do by showing it to\nthose men.” And hopefully I can pick up something too. “Don’t look so\ndaunted.

Take it, or agree to stay away\nfrom me.”\nIshnah sighed. “All right. We’ll see. Just don’t blame me if the pigs don’t\nend up talking.”\n41. On the Ground Looking Up\nRegardless, this is not your concern. You turned your back on divinity.\nIf Rayse becomes an issue, he will be dealt with.\nAnd so will you.\nTeft woke up.

The high ceiling vanished into the darkness.

The pain that was\nwith him always, like a persistent ringing, cutting deep to his core. This\npain had awakened him. The pain of need.\nNo, he wasn’t just some drunkard. He was far, far worse.\nHe stumbled out of the alleyway, trying to smooth his hair and beard.\nWomen he passed held safehands to mouths and noses, looking away as if\nembarrassed for him. Perhaps it was a good thing he’d lost his coat—storms\nhelp him if anyone recognized who he was. He’d shame the entire crew.\nYou’re already a shame to the crew, Teft, and you know it, he thought.\nYou’re a godless waste of spit.\nHe eventually found his way to the well, where he slouched in a line\nbehind some others. Once at the water, he fell down on his knees, then used\na trembling hand to fish out a drink with his tin cup. Once he tasted the cool\nwater, his stomach immediately cramped, rejecting it even though he was\nparched. This always happened after a night on the moss, so he knew to ride\nthe nausea and the cramps, hoping he could keep the water down.\nHe slumped, holding his stomach, frightening the people in line behind\nhim. Out in the crowd—there was always at least a small crowd near the\nwell—some men in uniforms shoved through. Forest green. Sadeas’s men.\nThey ignored the lines, then filled their buckets. When a man in Kholin\nblue objected, Sadeas’s soldiers got right up in his face. The Kholin soldier\nfinally backed down. Good lad. They didn’t need another brawl starting\nbetween Sadeas’s men and other soldiers.\nTeft dipped his cup again, the pain from his previous sip fading. This\nwell seemed deep. Rippling water on top, and a deep blackness below.\nHe almost threw himself in. If he woke up in Damnation tomorrow,\nwould he still feel that itching need inside? That would be a fitting torment.\nVoidbringers wouldn’t even have to flay his soul—all they’d need to do was\ntell him he’d never feel sated again, and then they could watch him squirm.\nReflected in the waters of the well, a face appeared over his shoulder. A\nwoman with pale white skin, glowing faintly, and hair that hovered around\nher head like clouds.\n“You leave me alone,” he said, slapping his hand into the water. “You\njust … you just go find someone who cares.”\nHe stumbled back to his feet, finally getting out of the way so someone\nelse could take a spot. Storms, what hour was it? Those women with\nbuckets were ready to draw water for the day. The drunken nighttime\ncrowds had been replaced by the enterprising and industrious.\nHe’d been out all night again. Kelek!\nReturning to the barracks would be the smart thing to do. But could he\nface them like this? He wandered through the market instead, eyes down.\nI’m getting worse, a piece of him realized. The first month in Dalinar’s\nemploy, he’d been able to resist for the most part. But he’d had money\nagain, after so long as a bridgeman. Having money was dangerous."

Having money was dangerous.\nHe’d functioned, only mossing an evening here, an evening there. But\nthen Kaladin had left, and this tower, where everything had felt so wrong …\nThose monsters of darkness, including one that had looked just like Teft.\nHe’d needed the moss to deal with that. Who wouldn’t? He sighed.\nWhen he looked up, he found that spren standing in front of him.\nTeft … she whispered. You’ve spoken oaths.…\nFoolish, stupid oaths, spoken when he’d hoped that being Radiant would\nremove the cravings. He turned away from her and found his way to a tent\nnestled among the taverns. Those were closed for the morning, but this\nplace—it had no name and didn’t need one—was open. It was always open,\njust like the ones back in Dalinar’s warcamp had been, just like the ones in\nSadeas’s warcamp. They were harder to find in some places than others. But\nthey were always there, nameless but still known.\nThe tough-looking Herdazian man sitting at the front waved him in. It\nwas dim inside, but Teft found his way to a table and slumped down. A\nwoman in tight clothing and a glove with no fingers brought him a little\nbowl of firemoss. They didn’t ask for payment. They all knew that he\nwouldn’t have any spheres on him today, not after his binge last night. But\nthey would make sure to get paid eventually.\nTeft stared at the little bowl, loathing himself. And yet the scent of it\nmade his longing multiply tenfold. He let out a whimpering groan, then\nseized the firemoss and ground it between his thumb and forefinger. The\nmoss let off a small plume of smoke, and in the dim light, the center of the\nmoss glowed like an ember.\nIt hurt, of course. He’d worn through his calluses last night, and now\nrubbed the moss with raw, blistering fingers. But this was a sharp, present\npain. A good kind of pain. Merely physical, it was a sign of life.\nIt took a minute before he felt the effects. A washing away of his pains,\nfollowed by a strengthening of his resolve. He could remember long ago\nthat the firemoss had done more to him—he remembered euphoria, nights\nspent in a dizzy, wonderful daze, where everything around him seemed to\nmake sense.\nThese days, he needed the moss to feel normal. Like a man scrambling\nup wet rocks, he could barely reach where everyone else was standing\nbefore he slowly started sliding back down. It wasn’t euphoria he craved\nanymore; it was the mere capacity to keep on going.\nThe moss washed away his burdens. Memories of that dark version of\nhimself. Memories of turning his family in as heretics, even though they’d\nbeen right all along. He was a wretch and a coward, and didn’t deserve to\nwear the symbol of Bridge Four. He’d as good as betrayed that spren\nalready. She’d best have fled.\nFor a moment he could give that all up to the firemoss.\nUnfortunately, there was something broken in Teft. Long ago he’d gone"

Long ago he’d gone\nto the moss at the urgings of other men in his squad in Sadeas’s army. They\ncould rub the stuff and get some benefit, like a man chewed ridgebark when\non guard duty to stay awake. A little firemoss, a little relaxation, and then\nthey moved on with their lives.\nTeft didn’t work that way. Burdens shoved aside, he could have gotten\nup and gone back to the bridgemen. He could have started his day.\nBut storms, a few more minutes sounded so nice. He kept going. He\nwent through three bowls before a garish light made him blink. He pulled\nhis face off the table where—to his shame—he’d drooled a puddle. How\nlong had it been, and what was that terrible, awful light?\n“Here he is,” Kaladin’s voice said as Teft blinked. A figure knelt beside\nthe table. “Oh, Teft…”\n“He owes us for three bowls,” said the den’s keeper. “One garnet\nbroam.”\n“Be glad,” an accented voice growled, “we do not rip off pieces of your\nbody and pay you with those.”\nStorms. Rock was here too? Teft groaned, turning away. “Don’t see me,”\nhe croaked. “Don’t…”\n“Our establishment is perfectly legal, Horneater,” the den keeper said.\n“If you assault us, be assured we will bring the guard and they will defend\nus.”\n“Here’s your blood money, you eel,” Kaladin said, pushing the light\ntoward them. “Rock, can you get him?”\nLarge hands took Teft, surprisingly gentle with their touch. He was\ncrying. Kelek …\n“Where’s your coat, Teft?” Kaladin asked from the darkness.\n“I sold it,” Teft admitted, squeezing his eyes shut against the shamespren\nthat drifted down around him, in the shape of flower petals. “I sold my own\nstorming coat.”\nKaladin fell silent, and Teft let Rock carry him from the den. Halfway\nback, he finally managed to scrounge up enough dignity to complain about\nRock’s breath and make them let him walk on his own feet—with a little\nsupport under the arms.\n* * *\nTeft envied better men than he. They didn’t have the itch, the one that went\nso deep that it stung his soul. It was persistent, always with him, and\ncouldn’t ever be scratched. Despite how hard he tried.\nKaladin and Rock set him up in one of the barrack rooms, private,\nwrapped in blankets and with a bowl of Rock’s stew in his hands. Teft made\nthe proper noises, the ones they expected. Apologies, promises he would tell\nthem if he was feeling the need again. Promises that he’d let them help him.\nThough he couldn’t eat the stew, not yet. It would be another day before he\ncould keep anything down.\nStorms, but they were good men.

But even back then, when\nhe’d been able to afford a little alcohol, he’d known that eventually he’d\nfind his way back. The liquor wasn’t ever enough.\nEven as he braced himself to go to work for the day, one nagging thought\novershadowed his mind. A shameful thought.\nI’m not going to get any more moss for a while, am I?\nThat sinister knowledge hurt him more than anything. He was going to\nhave to go a few excruciating days feeling like half a man. Days when he\ncouldn’t feel anything but his own self-loathing, days living with the shame,\nthe memories, the glances of other bridgemen.\nDays without any storming help whatsoever.\nThat terrified him.\n42. Consequences\nCephandrius, bearer of the First Gem,\nYou must know better than to approach us by relying upon\npresumption of past relationship.\nInside the increasingly familiar vision, Dalinar carefully nocked an arrow,\nthen released, sending a black-fletched missile into the back of the wildman.\nThe man’s screech was lost in the cacophony of battle. Ahead, men fought\nfrantically as they were pushed backward toward the edge of a cliff.\nDalinar methodically nocked a second arrow, then loosed. This arrow hit\nas well, lodging in a man’s shoulder. The man dropped his axe midswing,\ncausing him to miss the young, dark-skinned youth lying on the ground.\nThe boy was barely into his teens; the awkwardness hadn’t left him yet, and\nhe had limbs that seemed too long, a face that was too round, too childlike.\nDalinar might have let him run messages, but not hold a spear.\nThe lad’s age hadn’t prevented him from being named Prime Aqasix\nYanagawn the First, ruler of Azir, emperor of greater Makabak.\nDalinar had perched on some rocks, bow in hand. While he didn’t intend\nto repeat his mistake of letting Queen Fen manage all on her own in a\nvision, he also didn’t want Yanagawn to slip through it without challenge or\nstress. There was a reason that the Almighty had often put Dalinar in danger\nin these visions. He’d needed a visceral understanding of what was at stake.\nHe felled another enemy who got close to the boy. The shots weren’t\ndifficult from his vantage near the fight; he had some training with the bow\n—though his archery in recent years had been with so-called Shardbows,\nfabrial bows crafted with such a heavy draw weight that only a man in\nShardplate could use them."

Though each\nrepetition played out slightly differently, there were certain familiar details.\nThe scents of smoke and moldy, inhuman blood. The way that man below\nfell after losing an arm, screaming the same half-prayer, half-condemnation\nof the Almighty.\nWith Dalinar’s bowmanship, the band of defenders lasted against the\nenemy until that Radiant climbed up over the edge of the cliff, glowing in\nShardplate. Emperor Yanagawn sat down as the other soldiers rallied around\nthe Radiant and pushed the enemy backward.\nDalinar lowered his bow, reading the terror in the youth’s trembling\nfigure. Other men spoke of getting the shakes when a fight was over—the\nhorror of it catching up with them.\nThe emperor finally stumbled to his feet, using the spear like a staff. He\ndidn’t notice Dalinar, didn’t even question why some of the bodies around\nhim had arrows in them. This boy was no soldier, though Dalinar hadn’t\nexpected him to be one. From his experience, Azish generals were too\npragmatic to want the throne. It involved too much pandering to bureaucrats\nand, apparently, dictating essays.\nThe youth started down a path away from the cliff, and Dalinar followed.\nAharietiam. The people who lived through this had thought it the end of the\nworld. Surely they assumed they’d soon return to the Tranquiline Halls.\nHow would they respond to the information that—after four millennia—\nmankind still hadn’t been allowed back into heaven?\nThe boy stopped at the bottom of the twisting path, which led into the\nvalley between rock formations. He watched wounded men limp by,\nsupported by friends. Moans and shouts rose in the air. Dalinar intended to\nstep up and start explaining about these visions, but the boy strode out to\nwalk beside some wounded men, chatting with them.\nDalinar followed, curious, catching fragments of the conversation. What\nhappened here? Who are you? Why were you fighting?\nThe men didn’t have many answers. They were wounded, exhausted,\ntrailed by painspren. They did find their way to a larger group though, in the\ndirection Jasnah had gone during Dalinar’s previous visit to this vision.\nThe crowd had gathered around a man standing on a large boulder. Tall\nand confident, the man was in his thirties, and he wore white and blue. He\nhad an Alethi feel to him, except … not quite. His skin was a shade darker,\nand something was faintly off about his features.\nYet there was something … familiar about the man.\n“You must spread the word,” the man proclaimed. “We have won! At\nlong last, the Voidbringers are defeated. This is not my victory, or that of the\nother Heralds. It is your victory. You have done this.”\nSome of the people shouted in triumph. Too many others stood silent,\nstaring with dead eyes.\n“I will lead the charge for the Tranquiline Halls,” the man shouted. “You\nwill not see me again, but think not on that now! You have won your peace."

The greatest among them.\nWait. Did the king have dark eyes?\nThe group broke up, but the young emperor remained, staring at the\nplace where the Herald had stood. Finally, he whispered, “Oh, Yaezir. King\nof the Heralds.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, stepping up beside him. “That was him, Your\nExcellency. My niece visited this vision earlier, and she wrote that she\nthought she’d spotted him.”\nYanagawn grabbed Dalinar by the arm. “What did you say? You know\nme?”\n“You are Yanagawn of Azir,” Dalinar said. He nodded his head in a\nsemblance of a bow. “I am Dalinar Kholin, and I apologize that our meeting\nmust take place under such irregular circumstances.”\nThe youth’s eyes widened. “I see Yaezir himself first, and now my\nenemy.”\n“I am not your enemy.” Dalinar sighed. “And this is no mere dream,\nYour Excellency. I—”\n“Oh, I know it’s not a dream,” Yanagawn said. “As I am a Prime raised\nto the throne miraculously, the Heralds may choose to speak through me!”\nHe looked about. “This day we are living through, it is the Day of Glory?”\n“Aharietiam,” Dalinar said. “Yes.”\n“Why did they place you here? What does it mean?”\n“They didn’t place me here,” Dalinar said. “Your Excellency, I instigated\nthis vision, and I brought you into it.”\nSkeptical, the boy folded his arms. He wore the leather skirt provided by\nthe vision. He’d left his bronze-tipped spear leaning against a rock nearby.\n“Have you been told,” Dalinar asked, “that I am considered mad?”\n“There are rumors.”\n“Well, this was my madness,” Dalinar said. “I suffered visions during the\nstorms. Come. See.”\nHe led Yanagawn to a better view of the large field of the dead, which\nspread out from the mouth of the canyon. Yanagawn followed, then his face\ngrew ashen at the sight. Finally, he strode down onto the larger battlefield,\nmoving among the corpses, moans, and curses.\nDalinar walked beside him. So many dead eyes, so many faces twisted in\npain. Lighteyed and dark. Pale skin like the Shin and some Horneaters.\nDark skin like the Makabaki. Many that could have been Alethi, Veden, or\nHerdazian.\nThere were other things, of course.

You\nwanted me alone! And you can just … you just show me whatever will\nstrengthen your argument!”\n“If you accept that I have the power to show you these visions,” Dalinar\nsaid, “would that not in itself imply that you should listen to me?”\n“The Alethi are dangerous. Do you know what happened the last time\nthe Alethi were in Azir?”\n“The Sunmaker’s rule was a long time ago.”\n“The viziers have talked about this,” Yanagawn said. “They told me all\nabout it.

It was impossible to feel anything but sorrow when confronted by\nso much death.\nEventually, Yanagawn turned and started back the way they’d come.\nDalinar joined him, hands clasped behind.\n“They say,” Yanagawn whispered, “that when the Sunmaker rode out of\nthe passes and into Azir, he had one unexpected problem. He conquered my\npeople too quickly, and didn’t know what to do with all of his captives. He\ncouldn’t leave a fighting population behind him in the towns. There were\nthousands upon thousands of men he needed to murder.\n“Sometimes he’d simply assign the work to his soldiers. Every man was\nto kill thirty captives—like a child who had to find an armload of firewood\nbefore being allowed to play. In other places the Sunmaker declared\nsomething arbitrary. Say that every man with hair beyond a certain length\nwas to be slaughtered.\n“Before he was struck down with disease by the Heralds, he murdered\nten percent of the population of Azir. They say Zawfix was filled with the\nbones, blown by highstorms into piles as tall as the buildings.”\n“I am not my ancestor,” Dalinar said softly.\n“You revere him. The Alethi all but worship Sadees. You carry his\nstorming Shardblade.”\n“I gave that away.”\nThey stopped at the edge of the battlefield. The emperor had grit, but\ndidn’t know how to carry himself. He walked with shoulders slumped, and\nhis hands kept reaching for pockets his antiquated clothing didn’t have. He\nwas of low birth—though in Azir, they didn’t properly revere eye color."

He\nwas of low birth—though in Azir, they didn’t properly revere eye color.\nNavani had once told him it was because there weren’t enough people in\nAzir with light eyes.\nThe Sunmaker himself had used this to justify conquering them.\n“I am not my ancestor,” Dalinar repeated. “But I do share much with\nhim. A youth of brutality. A lifetime spent at war. I have one advantage he\ndid not.”\n“Which is?”\nDalinar met the young man’s eyes. “I’ve lived long enough to see the\nconsequences of what I’ve done.”\nYanagawn nodded slowly.\n“Yeah,” a voice piped up. “You’re old.”\nDalinar turned, frowning. That had sounded like a young girl. Why\nwould there be a girl on the battlefield?\n“I didn’t expect you to be so old,” the girl said. She sat perched cross-\nlegged on a large boulder nearby. “And you’re not really that black. They\ncall you Blackthorn, but you’re really more like … Dark-tan-thorn. Gawx is\nmore black than you are, and even he’s pretty brownish.”\nThe young emperor, remarkably, burst into an enormous grin. “Lift!\nYou’re back!” He started climbing up the boulder, heedless of decorum.\n“Not quite back,” she said. “Got sidetracked. But I’m close now.”\n“What happened in Yeddaw?” Yanagawn said, eager. “You barely gave\nme any kind of explanation!”\n“Those people lie about their food.” She narrowed her eyes at Dalinar as\nthe young emperor slipped down the boulder, then tried to climb up another\nside.\nThis is not possible, the Stormfather said in Dalinar’s mind. How did she\ncome here?\n“You didn’t bring her in?” Dalinar said softly.\nNo. This is not possible! How…?\nYanagawn finally attained the top of the boulder and gave the younger\ngirl a hug. She had long dark hair, pale white eyes, and tan skin, though she\nlikely wasn’t Alethi—the face was too round. Reshi, perhaps?\n“He’s trying to convince me I should trust him,” Yanagawn said,\npointing at Dalinar.\n“Don’t,” she said. “He’s got too nice a butt.”\nDalinar cleared his throat. “What?”\n“Your butt is too nice. Old guys shouldn’t have tight butts. It means you\nspend waaay too much time swinging a sword or punching people. You\nshould have an old flabby butt. Then I’d trust you.”\n“She … has a thing about butts,” Yanagawn said.\n“No I don’t,” the girl said, rolling her eyes. “If someone thinks I’m\nstrange for talking about butts, it’s usually because they’re jealous, ’cuz I’m\nthe only one without something rammed up mine.” She narrowed her eyes\nat Dalinar, then took the emperor by the arm. “Let’s go.”\n“But—” Dalinar said, raising his hand.\n“See, you’re learning.” She grinned at him.\nThen she and the emperor vanished.\nThe Stormfather rumbled in frustration. That woman! This is a creation\nspecifically meant to defy my will!"

This is a creation\nspecifically meant to defy my will!\n“Woman?” Dalinar asked, shaking his head.\nThat child is tainted by the Nightwatcher.\n“Technically, so am I.”\nThis is different. This is unnatural. She goes too far. The Stormfather\nrumbled his discontent, refusing to speak to Dalinar further. He seemed\ngenuinely upset.\nIn fact, Dalinar was forced to sit and wait until the vision finished. He\nspent the time staring out over that field of the dead, haunted equally by the\nfuture and the past.\n43. Spearman\nYou have spoken to one who cannot respond. We, instead, will take\nyour communication to us—though we know not how you located us\nupon this world.\nMoash picked at the mush that Febrth called a “stew.” It tasted like crem.\nHe stared at the flamespren in their large cookfire, trying to warm\nhimself as Febrth—a Thaylen man with striking Horneater red hair—argued\nwith Graves. The fire’s smoke curled into the air, and the light would be\nvisible for miles across the Frostlands. Graves didn’t care; he figured that if\nthe Everstorm hadn’t cleared the bandits out of the area, two Shardbearers\nwould be more than enough to deal with any who remained.\nShardblades can’t stop an arrow in the back, Moash thought, feeling\nexposed. And neither can Plate, if we’re not wearing it. His armor, and that\nof Graves, lay bundled in their wagon.\n“Look, that is the Triplets,” Graves said, waving toward a rock\nformation. “It’s right here on the map. We go west now.”\n“I’ve been this way before,” Febrth said. “We must continue south, you\nsee. Then east.”\n“The map—”\n“I have no need for your maps,” Febrth said, folding his arms. “The\nPassions guide me.”\n“The Passions?” Graves said, throwing his hands up. “The Passions?\nYou’re supposed to have abandoned such superstitions. You belong to the\nDiagram now!”\n“I can do both,” Febrth said solemnly.\nMoash stuffed another spoonful of “stew” into his mouth. Storms, he\nhated it when Febrth took a turn cooking. And when Graves took a turn.\nAnd when Fia took a turn. And … well, the stuff Moash himself cooked\ntasted like spiced dishwater. None of them could cook worth a dun chip.\nNot like Rock.\nMoash dropped his bowl, letting the mush slop over the side. He grabbed\nhis coat off a tree branch and stalked out into the night. The cold air felt\nstrange on his skin after so long in front of the fire. He hated how cold it\nwas down here. Perpetual winter.\nThe four of them had suffered through the storms hiding in the cramped,\nreinforced bottom of their wagon, which they’d chained to the ground.\nThey’d frightened away rogue parshmen with their Shardblades—they\nhadn’t been nearly as dangerous as he’d worried.

But that new storm …\nMoash kicked at a rock, but it was frozen to the ground and he just\nstubbed his toe. He cursed, then glanced over his shoulder as the argument\nended in shouts. He’d once admired how refined Graves seemed. That had\nbeen before spending weeks crossing a barren landscape together. The\nman’s patience had frayed to threads, and his refinement didn’t matter much\nwhen they were all eating slop and pissing behind hills.\n“So how lost are we?” Moash asked as Graves joined him in the\ndarkness outside camp.\n“Not lost at all,” Graves said, “if that idiot would actually look at a\nmap.” He glanced at Moash. “I’ve told you to get rid of that coat.”\n“Which I’ll do,” Moash said, “when we’re not crawling across winter’s\nown frozen backside.”\n“At least take the patch off. It might give us away, if we meet someone\nfrom the warcamps. Rip it off.” Graves turned on his heel and walked back\ntoward camp.\nMoash felt at the Bridge Four patch on his shoulder. It brought\nmemories. Joining Graves and his band, who had been planning to kill King\nElhokar. An assassination attempt once Dalinar was away, marching toward\nthe center of the Shattered Plains.\nFacing off against Kaladin, wounded and bleeding.\nYou. Will. Not. Have. Him.\nMoash’s skin had gone clammy from the cold. He slid his knife from his\nside sheath—he still wasn’t used to being able to carry one that long. A\nknife that was too big could get you into trouble as a darkeyes.\nHe wasn’t darkeyed anymore. He was one of them.\nStorms, he was one of them.\nHe cut the stitches on the Bridge Four patch. Up one side, then down the\nother. How simple it was. It would be harder to remove the tattoo he’d\ngotten with the others, but that he’d had placed on his shoulder, not his\nforehead.\nMoash held up the patch, trying to catch the firelight for a last look, and\nthen couldn’t bring himself to throw it away. He walked back and settled by\nthe fire. Were the others sitting around Rock’s stewpot somewhere?\nLaughing, joking, betting on how many mugs of ale Lopen could drink?\nRibbing Kaladin, trying to get him to crack a smile?\nMoash could almost hear their voices, and he smiled, imagining that he\nwas there. Then, he imagined Kaladin telling them what Moash had done.\nHe tried to kill me, Kaladin would say. He betrayed everything. His oath\nto protect the king, his duty to Alethkar, but most importantly us.\nMoash sagged, patch in his fingers. He should throw that thing in the\nfire.\nStorms. He should throw himself in the fire.\nHe looked up toward the skies, toward both Damnation and the\nTranquiline Halls.

A group of starspren quivered above.\nAnd beside them, something moving in the sky?\nMoash shouted, throwing himself backward off his perch as four\nVoidbringers descended upon the little camp. They smashed into the\nground, wielding long, sinuous swords. Not Shardblades—those were\nParshendi weapons.\nOne creature struck where Moash had been sitting an instant before.\nAnother creature stabbed Graves straight through the chest, then yanked the\nweapon free and beheaded him with a backhand swipe.\nGraves’s corpse tumbled and his Shardblade materialized, clanging to\nthe ground. Febrth and Fia didn’t have a chance. Other Voidbringers struck\nthem down, spilling their blood in this cold, forgotten land.\nThe fourth Voidbringer came for Moash, who threw himself into a roll.\nThe creature’s sword slammed down near him, hitting rock, the blade\nthrowing sparks.\nMoash rolled to his feet, and Kaladin’s training—drilled into him\nthrough hours and hours spent at the bottom of a chasm—took over. He\ndanced away, putting his back to the wagon, as his Shardblade fell into his\nfingers.\nThe Voidbringer rounded the fire toward him, light glittering from her\ntaut, muscular body. These weren’t like the Parshendi he’d seen on the\nShattered Plains. They had deep red eyes and red-violet carapace, some of\nwhich framed their faces. The one facing him had a swirling pattern to her\nskin, three different colors mixing. Red, black, white.\nDark light, like inverse Stormlight, clung to each of them. Graves had\nspoken of these creatures, calling their return merely one of many events\npredicted by the inscrutable “Diagram.”\nMoash’s foe came for him, and he lashed out with his Blade, driving her\nback. She seemed to glide as she moved, feet barely touching the ground.\nThe other three ignored him, instead picking through the camp, inspecting\nthe bodies. One soared in a graceful leap onto the wagon and began digging\nin the items there.\nHis opponent tried again, carefully sweeping her long, curved sword at\nhim. Moash shied back, Shardblade gripped with both hands, trying to\nintercept her weapon. His motions seemed clumsy compared to the graceful\npower of this creature. She slipped to the side, clothing rippling in the wind,\nbreath visible in the cold air. She wasn’t taking chances against a\nShardblade, and didn’t strike as Moash stumbled.\nStorms. This weapon was just too clunky. Six feet long, it was hard to\nangle right. Yes, it could cut through anything, but he needed to actually hit\nfor that to matter. It had been much easier to wield the thing wearing Plate.\nWithout it, he felt like a child holding an adult’s weapon.\nThe Voidbringer smiled. Then she struck with blurring speed. Moash\nstepped back, swinging, forcing her to twist to the side. He took a long cut\nup the arm, but his move prevented her from impaling him.\nHis arm flared with pain and he grunted. The Voidbringer regarded him\nconfidently, knowingly. He was dead. Maybe he should simply let it\nhappen.\nThe Voidbringer working in the cart said something eager, excited. He’d"

He kicked other items while digging it free, and\nsomething rolled out the back of the wagon, thumping against the stone. A\nspear.\nMoash looked down at his Shardblade, the wealth of nations, the most\nvaluable possession a man could own.\nWho am I kidding? he thought. Who did I ever think I was kidding?\nThe Voidbringer woman launched into an attack, but Moash dismissed\nhis Shardblade and dashed away. His attacker was so surprised that she\nhesitated, and Moash had time to dive for the spear, rolling to his feet.\nHolding the smooth wood in his hand, a familiar weight, Moash snapped\neasily into his stance. The air suddenly smelled damp and faintly rotten—he\nremembered the chasms. Life and death together, vines and rot.\nHe could almost hear Kaladin’s voice. You can’t fear a Shardblade. You\ncan’t fear a lighteyes on horseback. They kill with fear first and the sword\nsecond.\nStand your ground.\nThe Voidbringer came for him, and Moash stood his ground. He turned\nher aside by catching her weapon on the haft of the spear. Then he thrust the\nbutt end of the spear up underneath her arm as she came in for a backhand.\nThe Voidbringer gasped in surprise as Moash executed a takedown he’d\npracticed a thousand times in the chasms. He swung the butt of his spear at\nher ankles and swept her legs out from under her. He began to follow with a\nclassic twist and thrust, to stab down through her chest.\nUnfortunately, the Voidbringer didn’t fall. She caught herself in the air,\nhovering instead of collapsing. Moash noticed in time, and pulled out of his\nmaneuver to block her next attack.\nThe Voidbringer glided backward, then dropped to the ground in a\nprowling crouch, sword held to the side. She then leaped forward and\ngrabbed Moash’s spear as he tried to use it to ward her off. Storms! She\ngracefully pulled herself close to him, inside his reach. She smelled of wet\nclothing and of the alien, moldy scent he associated with the Parshendi.\nShe pressed her hand against Moash’s chest, and that dark light\ntransferred from her to him. Moash felt himself grow lighter.\nFortunately, Kaladin had tried this on him too.\nMoash seized the Voidbringer with one hand, holding on to the front of\nher loose shirt, as his body tried to fall into the air.\nHis sudden pull jerked her off balance, even lifted her a few inches. He\nyanked her up toward him with one hand while pushing his spearhead down\nagainst the rocky ground. That sent the two of them spinning in the air,\nhovering.\nShe cried out in an alien tongue. Moash dropped his spear and grabbed\nhis knife. She tried to shove him away, Lashing him again, stronger this\ntime.

Moash hung on tight and pushed\nthe knife farther.\nShe didn’t heal, as Kaladin would have. Her eyes stopped glowing, and\nthe dark light vanished.\nThe body grew limp. A short time later, the force pulling Moash upward\nran out. He dropped the five feet to the ground, her body cushioning his fall.\nOrange blood coated him, steaming in the chill air. He seized his spear\nagain, fingers slick with blood, and pointed it at the three remaining\nVoidbringers, who regarded him with stunned expressions.\n“Bridge Four, you bastards,” Moash growled.\nTwo of the Voidbringers turned toward the third, the other woman, who\nlooked Moash up and down.\n“You can probably kill me,” Moash said, wiping a hand on his clothes to\nimprove his grip. “But I’ll take one of you with me. At least one.”\nThey didn’t seem angry that he’d killed their friend. Storms though, did\nthings like these even have emotions? Shen had often just sat around\nstaring. He locked eyes with the woman at the center. Her skin was white\nand red, not a bit of black in it. The paleness of that white reminded him of\nthe Shin, who always looked sickly to Moash.\n“You,” she said in accented Alethi, “have passion.”\nOne of the others handed her Graves’s Shardblade. She held it up,\ninspecting it by the firelight. Then she rose into the air. “You may choose,”\nshe said to him. “Die here, or accept defeat and give up your weapons.”\nMoash clung to the spear in the shadow of that figure, her clothing\nrippling in the air. Did they think he’d actually trust them?\nBut then … did he really think he could stand against three of them?\nWith a shrug, he tossed aside the spear. He summoned his Blade. After\nall those years dreaming of one of these, he’d finally received one. Kaladin\nhad given it to him. And what good had come of it? He obviously couldn’t\nbe trusted with such a weapon.\nSetting his jaw, Moash pressed his hand to the gemstone, and willed the\nbond to break. The gemstone at its pommel flashed, and he felt an icy\ncoolness wash through him. Back to being a darkeyes.\nHe tossed the Blade to the ground. One of the Voidbringers took it.\nAnother flew off, and Moash was confused as to what was happening. A\nshort time later, that one returned with six more. Three attached ropes to the\nShardplate bundles, then flew off, hauling the heavy armor into the air after\nthem. Why not Lash it?\nMoash thought for a moment they were actually going to leave him\nthere, but finally two others grabbed him—one arm each—and hauled him\ninto the air.\n44.

People drinking\nand chatting, others strolling the path outside, shouting and joking. She\nenjoyed the warm, enveloping buzz of fellow humans who had turned this\ntomb of rock into something alive again.\nIt still daunted her to contemplate the size of the tower. How had anyone\nbuilt a place this big? It could gobble up most cities Veil had seen without\nhaving to loosen its belt.\nWell, best not to think about that. You needed to sneak low, beneath all\nthe questions that distracted scribes and scholars. That was the only way to\nget anything useful done.\nInstead she focused on the people. Their voices blended together, and\ncollectively they became a faceless crowd. But the grand thing about people\nwas that you could also choose to focus on particular faces, really see them,\nand find a wealth of stories. So many people with so many lives, each a\nseparate little mystery. Infinite detail, like Pattern. Look close at his fractal\nlines, and you’d realize each little ridge had an entire architecture of its\nown. Look close at a given person, and you’d see their uniqueness—see that\nthey didn’t quite match whatever broad category you’d first put them in.\n“So…” Red said, talking to Ishnah. Veil had brought three of her men\ntoday, with the spy woman to train them. So Veil could listen, learn, and try\nto judge if this woman was trustworthy—or if she was some kind of plant.\n“This is great,” Red continued, “but when do we learn the stuff with the\nknives? Not that I’m eager to kill anyone. Just … you know…”\n“I know what?” Ishnah asked.\n“Knives are deevy,” Red said.\n“Deevy?” Veil asked, opening her eyes.\nRed nodded. “Deevy. You know. Incredible, or neat, but in a smooooth\nway.”\n“Everyone knows that knives are deevy,” Gaz added.\nIshnah rolled her eyes. The short woman wore her havah with hand\ncovered, and her dress had a light touch of embroidery. Her poise and dress\nindicated she was a darkeyed woman of relatively high social standing.\nVeil drew more attention, and not just because of her white jacket and\nhat. It was the attention of men assessing whether they wanted to approach\nher, which they didn’t do with Ishnah. The way she carried herself, the prim\nhavah, kept them back.\nVeil sipped her drink, enjoying the wine.\n“You’ve heard lurid stories, I’m sure,” Ishnah said. “But espionage is not\nabout knives in alleys. I’d barely know what to do with myself if I had to\nstab someone.”\nThe three men deflated.\n“Espionage,” Ishnah continued, “is about the careful gathering of\ninformation. Your task is to observe, but to not be observed. You must be\nlikable enough that people talk to you, but not so interesting that they\nremember you.”\n“Well, Gaz is out,” Red said.\n“Yeah,” Gaz said, “it’s a curse to be so storming interesting.”"

The lanky soldier had leaned in,\ncup of cheap wine left untouched. “How?” he asked. “I’m tall. Gaz has one\neye. We’ll be remembered.”\n“You need to learn to channel attention toward superficial traits you can\nchange, and away from traits you cannot. Red, if you wore an eye patch,\nthat detail would stick in their minds. Vathah, I can teach you how to slouch\nso your height isn’t noticeable—and if you add an unusual accent, people\nwill describe you by that. Gaz, I could put you in a tavern and have you lie\non the table in a feigned drunken stupor. Nobody will notice the eye patch;\nthey’ll ignore you as a drunkard.\n“That is beside the point. We must begin with observation. If you are to\nbe useful, you need to be able to make quick assessments of a location,\nmemorize details, and be able to report back. Now, close your eyes.”\nThey reluctantly did so, Veil joining them.\n“Now,” Ishnah said. “Can any of you describe the tavern’s occupants?\nWithout looking, mind you.”\n“Uh…” Gaz scratched at his eye patch. “There’s a cute one at the bar.\nShe might be Thaylen.”\n“What color is her blouse?”\n“Hm. Well, it’s low cut, and she’s grown some nice rockbuds … uh…”\n“There’s this really ugly guy with an eye patch,” Red said. “Short,\nannoying type. Drinks your wine when you aren’t looking.”\n“Vathah?” Ishnah asked. “What about you?”\n“I think there were some guys at the bar,” he said. “They were in …\nSebarial uniforms? And maybe half the tables were occupied. I couldn’t say\nby who.”\n“Better,” Ishnah said. “I didn’t expect you to be able to do this. It’s\nhuman nature to ignore these things. I’ll train you though, so that—”\n“Wait,” Vathah said. “What about Veil? What does she remember?”\n“Three men at the bar,” Veil said absently. “Older man with whitening\nhair, and two soldiers, probably related, judging by those hooked noses. The\nyounger one is drinking wine; the older one is trying to pick up the woman\nGaz noticed. She’s not Thaylen, but she’s wearing Thaylen dress with a\ndeep violet blouse and a forest-green skirt. I don’t like the pairing, but she\nseems to. She’s confident, used to playing with the attention of men. But I\nthink she came here looking for someone, because she’s ignoring the soldier\nand keeps glancing over her shoulder.\n“The barkeep is an older man, short enough that he stands on boxes\nwhen he fills orders. I bet he hasn’t been a barkeep long. He hesitates when\nsomeone orders, and he has to glance over the bottles, reading their glyphs\nbefore he finds the right one.

There are three barmaids—one is on break—\nand fourteen customers other than us.” She opened her eyes. “I can tell you\nabout them.”\n“Won’t be necessary,” Ishnah said as Red clapped softly. “Very\nimpressive, Veil, though I should note that there are fifteen other customers,\nnot fourteen.”\nVeil started, then glanced around the tent room again, counting—as\nshe’d done in her head just a moment ago. Three at that table … four over\nthere … two women standing together by the door …\nAnd a woman she’d missed, nestled into a chair by a small table at the\nback of the tent. She wore simple clothing, a skirt and blouse of Alethi\npeasant design. Had she intentionally chosen clothing that blended in with\nthe white of the tent and brown of the tables? And what was she doing\nthere?\nTaking notes, Veil thought with a spike of alarm. The woman had\ncarefully hidden a little notebook in her lap. “Who is she?” Veil hunkered\ndown. “Why is she watching us?”\n“Not us specifically,” Ishnah said. “There will be dozens like her in the\nmarket, moving like rats, gathering what information they can. She might\nbe independent, selling tidbits she finds, but likely she’s employed by one\nof the highprinces. That’s the job I used to do. I’d guess from the people\nshe’s watching that she’s been told to gather a report on the mood of the\ntroops.”\nVeil nodded and listened intently as Ishnah started training the men in\nmemory tricks. She suggested they should learn glyphs, and use some ploy\n—like making marks on their hands—to help them keep track of\ninformation. Veil had heard of some of these tricks, including the one\nIshnah talked about, the so-called mind museum.\nMost interesting were Ishnah’s tips on how to tell what was relevant to\nreport, and how to find it. She talked about listening for the names of\nhighprinces and for common words used as stand-ins for more important\nmatters, and about how to listen for someone who had just the right amount\nof drink in them to say things they shouldn’t. Tone, she said, was key. You\ncould sit five feet from someone sharing important secrets, but miss it\nbecause you were focused on the argument at the next table over.\nThe state she described was almost meditative—sitting and letting your\nears take in everything, your mind latching on to only certain conversations.\nVeil found it fascinating. But after about an hour of training, Gaz\ncomplained that his head felt like he’d had four bottles already. Red was\nnodding, and the way his eyes were crossed made him seem completely\noverwhelmed.\nVathah though … he’d closed his eyes and was reeling off descriptions\nof everyone in the room to Ishnah. Veil grinned. For as long as she’d known\nthe man, he’d gone about each of his duties as if he had a boulder tied to his\nback. Slow to move, quick to find a place to sit down and rest. Seeing this\nenthusiasm from him was encouraging.\nIn fact, Veil was so engaged, she completely missed how much time had\npassed. When she heard the market bells she cursed softly. “I’m a storming\nfool.”"

When she heard the market bells she cursed softly. “I’m a storming\nfool.”\n“Veil?” Vathah asked.\n“I’ve got to get going,” she said. “Shallan has an appointment.” Who\nwould have thought that bearing an ancient, divine mantle of power and\nhonor would involve so many meetings?\n“And she can’t make it without you?” Vathah said.\n“Storms, have you watched that girl? She’d forget her feet if they\nweren’t stuck on. Keep practicing! I’ll meet up with you later.” She pulled\non her hat and went dashing through the Breakaway.\n* * *\nA short time later, Shallan Davar—now safely tucked back into a blue\nhavah—strolled through the hallway beneath Urithiru. She was pleased with\nthe work that Veil was doing with the men, but storms, did she have to drink\nso much? Shallan burned off practically an entire barrel’s worth of alcohol\nto clear her head.\nShe took a deep breath, then stepped into the former library room. Here\nshe found not only Navani, Jasnah, and Teshav, but a host of ardents and\nscribes. May Aladar, Adrotagia from Kharbranth … there were even three\nstormwardens, the odd men with the long beards who liked to predict the\nweather. Shallan had heard that they would occasionally use the blowing of\nthe winds to foretell the future, but they never offered such services openly.\nBeing near them made Shallan wish for a glyphward. Veil didn’t keep\nany handy, unfortunately. She was basically a heretic, and thought about\nreligion as often as she did seasilk prices in Rall Elorim. At least Jasnah had\nthe backbone to pick a side and announce it; Veil would simply shrug and\nmake some wisecrack. It—\n“Mmmm…” Pattern whispered from her skirt. “Shallan?”\nRight. She’d been just standing in the doorway, hadn’t she? She walked\nin, unfortunately passing Janala, who was acting as Teshav’s assistant. The\npretty young woman stood with her nose perpetually in the air, and was the\ntype of person whose very enunciation made Shallan’s skin crawl.\nThe woman’s arrogance was what Shallan didn’t like—not, of course,\nthat Adolin had been courting Janala soon before meeting Shallan. She had\nonce tried to avoid Adolin’s former romantic partners, but … well, that was\nlike trying to avoid soldiers on a battlefield. They were just kind of\neverywhere.\nA dozen conversations buzzed through the room: talk about weights and\nmeasures, the proper placement of punctuation, and the atmospheric\nvariations in the tower. Once she’d have given anything to be in a room like\nthis. Now she was constantly late to the meetings. What had changed?\nI know how much a fraud I am, she thought, hugging the wall, passing a\npretty young ardent discussing Azish politics with one of the stormwardens.\nShallan had barely perused those books that Adolin had brought her.

The woman nodded eagerly. “Yes, but how to stabilize it,\nBrightness? With the sails underneath, it will want to spin over, won’t it?”\nShallan’s proximity to Navani had offered ample opportunity to study\nfabrial science. Why hadn’t she? As it enveloped her—the ideas, the\nquestions, the logic—she suddenly felt she was drowning. Overwhelmed.\nEveryone in this room knew so much, and she felt insignificant compared to\nthem.\nI need someone who can handle this, she thought. A scholar. Part of me\ncan become a scholar. Not Veil, or Brightness Radiant. But someone—\nPattern started humming on her dress again. Shallan backed to the wall.\nNo, this … this was her, wasn’t it? Shallan had always wanted to be a\nscholar, hadn’t she? She didn’t need another persona to deal with this.\nRight?\n… Right?\nThe moment of anxiety passed, and she breathed out, forcing herself to\nsteady. Eventually she pulled a pad of paper and a charcoal pencil out of her\nsatchel, then sought out Jasnah and presented herself.\nJasnah cocked an eyebrow. “Late again?”\n“Sorry.”\n“I intended to ask your help understanding some of the translations\nwe’re receiving from the Dawnchant, but we haven’t time before my\nmother’s meeting starts.”\n“Maybe I could help you—”\n“I have a few items to finish up. We can speak later.”\nAn abrupt dismissal, but nothing more than Shallan had come to expect.\nShe walked over to a chair beside the wall and sat down. “Surely,” she said\nsoftly, “if Jasnah had known that I’d just confronted a deep insecurity of\nmine, she’d have shown some empathy. Right?”\n“Jasnah?” Pattern asked. “I do not think you are paying attention,\nShallan. She is not very empathetic.”\nShallan sighed.\n“You’re empathetic though!”\n“The pathetic part, at least.” She steeled herself. “I belong here, Pattern,\ndon’t I?”\n“Mmm. Yes, of course you do. You’ll want to sketch them, right?”\n“The classic scholars didn’t just draw. The Oilsworn knew mathematics\n—he created the study of ratios in art. Galid was an inventor, and her\ndesigns are still used in astronomy today. Sailors couldn’t find longitude at\nsea until the arrival of her clocks. Jasnah’s a historian—and more. That’s\nwhat I want.”\n“Are you sure?”\n“I think so.” Problem was, Veil wanted to spend her days drinking and\nlaughing with the men, practicing espionage. Radiant wanted to practice\nwith the sword and spend time around Adolin. What did Shallan want? And\ndid it matter?\nEventually Navani called the meeting to order, and people took seats.\nScribes on one side of Navani, ardents from a variety of devotaries on the\nother—and far from Jasnah.

As the stormwardens settled down farther\naround the ring of seats, Shallan noticed Renarin standing in the doorway.\nHe shuffled, peeking in, but not entering. When several scholars turned\ntoward him, he stepped backward, as if their stares were physically forcing\nhim out.\n“I…” Renarin said. “Father said I could come … just listen maybe.”\n“You’re more than welcome, Cousin,” Jasnah said. She nodded for\nShallan to get him a stool, so she did—and didn’t even protest being\nordered about. She could be a scholar. She’d be the best little ward ever.\nHead down, Renarin rounded the ring of scholars, keeping a white-\nknuckled grip on a chain hung from his pocket. As soon as he sat, he started\npulling the chain between the fingers of one hand, then the other.\nShallan did her best to take notes, and not stray into sketching people\ninstead. Fortunately, the proceedings were more interesting than usual.\nNavani had most of the scholars here working on trying to understand\nUrithiru. Inadara reported first—she was a wizened scribe who reminded\nShallan of her father’s ardents—explaining that her team had been trying to\nascertain the meaning of the strange shapes of the rooms and tunnels in the\ntower.\nShe went on at length, talking of defensive constructions, air filtration,\nand the wells. She pointed out groupings of rooms that were shaped oddly,\nand of the bizarre murals they’d found, depicting fanciful creatures.\nWhen she eventually finished, Kalami reported on her team, who were\nconvinced that certain gold and copper metalworks they’d found embedded\nin walls were fabrials, but they didn’t seem to do anything, even with gems\nattached. She passed around drawings, then moved on to explaining the\nefforts—failed so far—they’d taken to try to infuse the gemstone pillar. The\nonly working fabrials were the lifts.\n“I suggest,” interrupted Elthebar, head of the stormwardens, “that the\nratio of the gears used in the lift machinery might be indicative of the nature\nof those who built it. It is the science of digitology, you see. You can judge\nmuch about a man by the width of his fingers.”\n“And this has to do with gears … how?” Teshav asked.\n“In every way!” Elthebar said. “Why, the fact that you don’t know this is\na clear indication that you are a scribe. Your writing is pretty, Brightness.\nBut you must give more heed to science.”\nPattern buzzed softly.\n“I never have liked him,” Shallan whispered. “He acts nice around\nDalinar, but he’s quite mean.”\n“So … which attribute of his are we totaling and how many people are in\nthe sample size?” Pattern asked.\n“Do you think, maybe,” Janala said, “we are asking the wrong\nquestions?”\nShallan narrowed her eyes, but checked herself, suppressing her\njealousy. There was no need to hate someone simply because they’d been\nclose to Adolin.\nIt was just that something felt … off about Janala. Like many women at\ncourt, her laughter sounded rehearsed, contained. Like they used it as a\nseasoning, rather than actually feeling it."

Like they used it as a\nseasoning, rather than actually feeling it.\n“What do you mean, child?” Adrotagia asked Janala.\n“Well, Brightness, we talk about the lifts, the strange fabrial column, the\ntwisting hallways. We try to understand these things merely from their\ndesigns. Maybe instead we should figure out the tower’s needs, and then\nwork backward to determine how these things might have met them.”\n“Hmmm,” Navani said. “Well, we know that they grew crops outside.\nDid some of these wall fabrials provide heat?”\nRenarin mumbled something.\nEveryone in the room looked at him. Not a few seemed surprised to hear\nhim speak, and he shrank back.\n“What was that, Renarin?” Navani asked.\n“It’s not like that,” he said softly. “They’re not fabrials. They’re a\nfabrial.”\nThe scribes and scholars shared looks. The prince … well, he often\nincited such reactions. Discomforted stares.\n“Brightlord?” Janala asked. “Are you perhaps secretly an artifabrian?\nStudying engineering by night, reading the women’s script?”\nSeveral of the others chuckled. Renarin blushed deeply, lowering his\neyes farther.\nYou’d never laugh like that at any other man of his rank, Shallan\nthought, feeling her cheeks grow hot. The Alethi court could be severely\npolite—but that didn’t mean they were nice. Renarin always had been a\nmore acceptable target than Dalinar or Adolin.\nShallan’s anger was a strange sensation. On more than one occasion,\nshe’d been struck by Renarin’s oddness. His presence at this meeting was\njust another example. Was he thinking of finally joining the ardents? And he\ndid that by simply showing up at a meeting for scribes, as if he were one of\nthe women?\nAt the same time, how dare Janala embarrass him?\nNavani started to say something, but Shallan cut in. “Surely, Janala, you\ndidn’t just try to insult the son of the highprince.”\n“What? No, no of course I didn’t.”\n“Good,” Shallan said. “Because, if you had been trying to insult him,\nyou did a terrible job. And I’ve heard that you’re very clever. So full of wit,\nand charm, and … other things.”\nJanala frowned at her. “… Is that flattery?”\n“We weren’t talking of your chest, dear. We’re speaking of your mind!\nYour wonderful, brilliant mind, so keen that it’s never been sharpened! So\nquick, it’s still running when everyone else is done! So dazzling, it’s never\nfailed to leave everyone in awe at the things you say. So … um…”\nJasnah was glaring at her.\n“… Hmm…” Shallan held up her notebook. “I took notes.”\n“Could we have a short break, Mother?” Jasnah asked.\n“An excellent suggestion,” Navani said. “Fifteen minutes, during which\neveryone should consider a list of requirements this tower would have, if it\nwere to somehow become self-sufficient.”\nShe rose, and the meeting broke up into individual conversations again."

Instead, you threw a dictionary at her\nhead.”\n“Sorry. She gets on my nerves.”\n“Janala is a fool, just bright enough to be proud of the wits she has, but\nstupid enough to be unaware of how outmatched they are.” Jasnah rubbed\nher temples. “Storms. This is why I never take wards.”\n“Because they give you so much trouble.”\n“Because I’m bad at it. I have scientific evidence of that fact, and you are\nbut the latest experiment.” Jasnah shooed her away, rubbing her temples.\nShallan, feeling ashamed, walked to the side of the room, while everyone\nelse got refreshments.\n“Mmmm!” Pattern said as Shallan leaned against the wall, notebook held\ncloser to her chest. “Jasnah doesn’t seem angry. Why are you sad?”\n“Because I’m an idiot,” Shallan said. “And a fool. And … because I\ndon’t know what I want.” Hadn’t it been only a week or two ago that she’d\ninnocently assumed she had it figured out? Whatever “it” was?\n“I can see him!” said a voice to her side.\nShallan jumped and turned to find Renarin staring at her skirt and the\npattern there, which blended into her embroidery. Distinct if you knew to\nlook, but easy to miss.\n“He doesn’t turn invisible?” Renarin said.\n“He says he can’t.”\nRenarin nodded, then looked up at her. “Thank you.”\n“For?”\n“Defending my honor. When Adolin does that, someone usually gets\nstabbed. Your way was pleasanter.”\n“Well, nobody should take that tone with you. They wouldn’t dare do it\nto Adolin. And besides, you’re right. This place is one big fabrial.”\n“You feel it too? They keep talking about this device or that device, but\nthat’s wrong, isn’t it? That’s like taking the parts of a cart, without realizing\nyou’ve got a cart in the first place.”\nShallan leaned in. “That thing that we fought, Renarin. It could stretch\nits tendrils all the way up to the very top of Urithiru. I felt its wrongness\nwherever I went. That gemstone at the center is tied to everything.”\n“Yes, this isn’t only a collection of fabrials. It’s many fabrials put\ntogether to make one big fabrial.”\n“But what does it do?” Shallan asked.\n“It does being a city.” He frowned. “Well, I mean, it bees a city.… It\ndoes what the city is.…”\nShallan shivered. “And the Unmade was running it.”\n“Which let us discover this room and the fabrial column,” Renarin said."

Always look on the bright\nside.”\n“Logically,” Shallan said, “the bright side is the only side you can look\non, because the other side is dark.”\nRenarin laughed. It brought to mind how her brothers would laugh at\nwhat she said. Maybe not because it was the most hilarious thing ever\nspoken, but because it was good to laugh. That reminded her of what Jasnah\nhad said, though, and Shallan found herself glancing at the woman.\n“I know my cousin is intimidating,” Renarin whispered to her. “But\nyou’re a Radiant too, Shallan. Don’t forget that. We could stand up to her if\nwe wanted to.”\n“Do we want to?”\nRenarin grimaced. “Probably not. So often, she’s right, and you just end\nup feeling like one of the ten fools.”\n“True, but … I don’t know if I can stand being ordered around like a\nchild again. I’m starting to feel crazy. What do I do?”\nRenarin shrugged. “I’ve found the best way to avoid doing what Jasnah\nsays is to not be around when she’s looking for someone to give orders to.”\nShallan perked up. That made a lot of sense. Dalinar would need his\nRadiants to go do things, right? She needed to get away, just until she could\nfigure things out. Go somewhere … like on that mission to Kholinar?\nWouldn’t they need someone who could sneak into the palace and activate\nthe device?\n“Renarin,” she said, “you’re a genius.”\nHe blushed, but smiled.\nNavani called the meeting together again, and they sat to continue\ndiscussing fabrials. Jasnah tapped Shallan’s notebook and she did a better\njob of taking the minutes, practicing her shorthand. It wasn’t nearly as\nirksome now, as she had an exit strategy. An escape route.\nShe was appreciating that when she noticed a tall figure striding through\nthe door. Dalinar Kholin cast a shadow, even when he wasn’t standing in\nfront of the light. Everyone immediately hushed.\n“Apologies for my tardiness.” He glanced at his wrist, and the forearm\ntimepiece that Navani had given him. “Please don’t stop because of me.”\n“Dalinar?” Navani asked. “You’ve never attended a meeting of scribes\nbefore.”\n“I just thought I should watch,” Dalinar said. “Learn what this piece of\nmy organization is doing.” He settled down on a stool outside the ring. He\nlooked like a warhorse trying to perch on a stand meant for a show pony.\nThey started up again, everyone obviously self-conscious. She’d have\nthought that Dalinar would know to stay away from meetings like this,\nwhere women and scribes …\nShallan cocked her head as she saw Renarin glance at his father. Dalinar\nresponded with a raised fist.\nHe came so Renarin wouldn’t feel awkward, Shallan realized. It can’t be\nimproper or feminine for the prince to be here if the storming Blackthorn\ndecides to attend."

A Revelation\nAs the waves of the sea must continue to surge, so must our will\ncontinue resolute.\nAlone.\nThe Voidbringers carried Moash to Revolar, a city in central Alethkar. Once\nthere, they dropped him outside the city and shoved him toward a group of\nlesser parshmen.\nHis arms ached from being carried. Why hadn’t they used their powers\nto Lash him upward and make him lighter, as Kaladin would have?\nHe stretched his arms, looking around. He’d been to Revolar many\ntimes, working a regular caravan to Kholinar. Unfortunately, that didn’t\nmean he’d seen much of the city. Every city of size had a little huddle of\nbuildings on the outskirts for people like him: modern-day nomads who\nworked caravans or ran deliveries. The people of the eaves, some had called\nthem. Men and women who hovered close enough to civilization to get out\nof the weather when it turned bad, but who never really belonged.\nFrom the looks of things, Revolar had quite the eaves culture now—too\nmuch of one. The Voidbringers seemed to have taken over the entire\nstorming place, exiling the humans to the outskirts.\nThe Voidbringers left him without a word, despite having lugged him all\nthis distance. The parshmen who took custody of him here looked like a\nhybrid between Parshendi warriors and the normal, docile parshmen he’d\nknown from many a caravan run. They spoke perfect Alethi as they shoved\nhim toward a group of humans in a little pen.\nMoash settled in to wait. Looked like the Voidbringers had patrols\nscouting the area, grabbing human stragglers. Eventually, the parshmen\nherded him and the others toward one of the large storm bunkers outside the\ncity—used for housing armies or multiple caravans during highstorms.\n“Don’t make trouble,” a parshwoman said, specifically eyeing Moash.\n“Don’t fight, or you’ll be killed. Don’t run, or you’ll be beaten. You’re the\nslaves now.”\nSeveral of the humans—homesteaders, from the looks of it—started\nweeping. They clutched meager bundles, which parshmen searched\nthrough. Moash could read the signs of their loss in their reddened eyes and\nragged possessions. The Everstorm had wiped out their farm. They’d come\nto the big city looking for refuge.\nHe had nothing on him of value, not any longer, and the parshmen let\nhim go in before the others. He walked into the bunker, feeling a surreal\nsense of … abandonment? He’d spent the trip here alternately assuming\nhe’d be executed or interrogated. Instead, they’d made a common slave of\nhim? Even in Sadeas’s army, he’d never technically been a slave. Assigned\nto bridge runs, yes. Sent to die. But he’d never worn the brands on his\nforehead. He felt at the Bridge Four tattoo under his shirt, on his left\nshoulder."

He felt at the Bridge Four tattoo under his shirt, on his left\nshoulder.\nThe vast, high-ceilinged storm bunker was shaped like a huge stone loaf.\nMoash ambled through it, hands stuffed in his coat pockets. Huddled groups\nof people regarded him with hostility, even though he was just another\nrefugee.\nHe’d always been met with hostility, no matter where he storming went.\nA youth like him, too big and obviously too confident for a darkeyes, had\nbeen considered a threat. He’d joined the caravans to give himself\nsomething productive to do, encouraged by his grandparents. They’d been\nmurdered for their kindly ways, and Moash … he’d spent his life putting up\nwith looks like that.\nA man on his own, a man you couldn’t control, was dangerous. He was\ninherently frightening, just because of who he was. And nobody would ever\nlet him in.\nExcept Bridge Four.\nWell, Bridge Four had been a special case, and he’d failed that test.\nGraves had been right to tell him to cut the patch off. This was who he\nreally was. The man everyone looked at with distrust, pulling their children\ntight and nodding for him to move along.\nHe stalked down the middle of the structure, which was so wide it\nneeded pillars to hold up the ceiling. Those rose like trees, Soulcast right\ninto the rock below. The edges of the building were crowded with people,\nbut the center was kept clear and patrolled by armed parshmen. They’d set\nup stations with wagons as perches, where parshmen were addressing\ncrowds. Moash went over to one.\n“In case we missed any,” the parshman shouted, “experienced farmers\nshould report to Bru at the front end of the chamber. He will assign you a\nplot of land to work. Today, we also need workers to carry water in the city,\nand more to clear debris from the last storm. I can take twenty of each.”\nMen started calling out their willingness, and Moash frowned, leaning\ntoward a man nearby. “They offer us work? Aren’t we slaves?”\n“Yeah,” the man said. “Slaves who don’t eat unless they work. They let\nus choose what we want to do, though it’s not much of a storming choice.\nOne kind of drudgery or another.”\nWith a start, Moash realized that the man had pale green eyes. Yet he still\nraised his hand and volunteered to carry water—something that had once\nbeen parshman work. Well, that was a sight that couldn’t help but brighten a\nman’s day. Moash shoved hands back in pockets and continued through the\nroom, checking each of the three stations where parshmen offered jobs.\nSomething about these parshmen and their perfect Alethi unsettled him.\nThe Voidbringers were what he’d expected, with their alien accents and\ndramatic powers. But the ordinary parshmen—many of them looked like\nParshendi now, with those taller builds—seemed almost as bewildered at\ntheir reversal in fortune as the humans were.\nEach of the three stations dealt with a different category of labor.

The\none at the far end was looking for farmers, women with sewing skill, and\ncobblers. Food, uniforms, boots. The parshmen were preparing for war.\nAsking around, Moash learned they’d already grabbed the smiths, fletchers,\nand armorers—and if you were found hiding skill in any of these three, your\nwhole family would be put on half rations.\nThe middle station was for basic labor. Hauling water, cleaning, cooking\nfood. The last station was the most interesting to Moash. This was for hard\nlabor.\nHe lingered here, listening to a parshman ask for volunteers to pull\nwagons of supplies with the army when it marched. Apparently, there\nweren’t enough chulls to move wagons for what was coming.\nNobody raised their hands for this one. It sounded like ghastly work, not\nto mention the fact that it would mean marching toward battle.\nThey’ll need to press the people into this, Moash thought. Maybe they\ncan round up some lighteyes and make them trudge across the rock like\nbeasts of burden. He’d like to see that.\nAs he left this last station, Moash spotted a group of men with long\nstaffs, leaning against the wall. Sturdy boots, waterskins in holsters tied to\ntheir thighs, and a walking kit sewn into the trousers on the other side. He\nknew from experience what that would carry. A bowl, spoon, cup, thread,\nneedle, patches, and some flint and tinder.\nCaravaneers. The long staffs were for slapping chull shells while\nwalking beside them. He’d worn an outfit like that many times, though\nmany of the caravans he’d worked had used parshmen to pull wagons\ninstead of chulls. They were faster.\n“Hey,” he said, strolling over to the caravaneers. “Is Guff still around?”\n“Guff?” one of the caravaneers said. “Old wheelwright? Half a reed tall?\nBad at cussing?”\n“That’s him.”\n“I think he’s over there,” the young man said, pointing with his staff. “In\nthe tents. But there ain’t work, friend.”\n“The shellheads are marching,” Moash said, thumbing over his shoulder.\n“They’ll need caravaneers.”\n“Positions are full,” another of the men said. “There was a fight to see\nwho got those jobs. Everyone else will be pulling wagons. Don’t draw too\nmuch attention, or they’ll slap a harness on you. Mark my words.”\nThey smiled in a friendly way to Moash, and he gave them an old\ncaravaneers’ salute—close enough to a rude gesture that everyone else\nmistook it—and strode in the direction they’d pointed. Typical. Caravaneers\nwere a big family—and, like a family, prone to squabbling.\nThe “tents” were really some sections of cloth that had been stretched\nfrom the wall to poles driven into buckets of rocks to keep them steady.\nThat made a kind of tunnel along the wall here, and underneath, a lot of\nolder people coughed and sniffled.

He had been sanding a piece of wood—an axle, by the looks\nof it.\nHe squinted as Moash stepped up. “Moash?” he said. “Really? What\nstorming storm brought you here?”\n“You wouldn’t believe me if I told you,” Moash said, squatting down\nbeside the old man.\n“You were on Jam’s caravan,” Guff said. “Off to the Shattered Plains;\ngave you all up for dead. Wouldn’t have bet a dun chip on you returning.”\n“A wise enough bet,” Moash said. He hunched forward, resting his arms\non his knees. In this tunnel, the buzz of people outside seemed a distant\nthing, though only cloth separated them.\n“Son?” Guff asked. “Why you here, boy? What do you want?”\n“I just need to be who I was.”\n“That makes as much sense as the storming Stormfather playing the\nflute, boy. But you wouldn’t be the first to go off to those Plains and come\nback not all right. No you wouldn’t. That’s the Stormfather’s storming own\ntruth, that storming is.”\n“They tried to break me. Damnation, they did break me. But then he\nmade me again, a new man.” Moash paused. “I threw it all away.”\n“Sure, sure,” Guff said.\n“I always do that,” Moash whispered. “Why must we always take\nsomething precious, Guff, and find ourselves hating it? As if by being pure,\nit reminds us of just how little we deserve it. I held the spear, and I stabbed\nmyself with it.…”\n“The spear?” Guff asked. “Boy, you a storming soldier?”\nMoash looked at him with a start, then stood up, stretching, showing his\npatchless uniform coat.\nGuff squinted in the darkness. “Come with me.” The old wheelwright\nrose—with difficulty—and set his piece of wood on his chair. He led Moash\nwith a rickety gait farther into the cloth tunnel, and they entered a portion of\nthe tented area that was more roomlike, the far corner of the large bunker.\nHere, a group of maybe a dozen people sat in furtive conversation, chairs\npulled together.\nA man at the door grabbed Guff by the arm as he shuffled in. “Guff?\nYou’re supposed to be on guard, fool man.”\n“I’m storming on storming guard, you pisser,” Guff said, shaking his arm\nfree. “The bright wanted to know if we found any soldiers. Well I found a\nstorming soldier, so storm off.”\nThe guard turned his attention to Moash, then flicked his eyes to\nMoash’s shoulder. “Deserter?”\nMoash nodded. It was true in more ways than one."

It was true in more ways than one.\n“What’s this?” One of the men stood up, a tall fellow. Something about\nhis silhouette, that bald head, that cut of clothing …\n“Deserter, Brightlord,” the guard said.\n“From the Shattered Plains,” Guff added.\nThe highlord, Moash realized. Paladar. Vamah’s kinsman and regent, a\nnotoriously harsh man. In years past, he had nearly run the city to the\nground, driving away many darkeyes who had the right of travel. Not a\ncaravan had passed when someone hadn’t complained about Paladar’s greed\nand corruption.\n“From the Shattered Plains, you say?” Paladar said. “Excellent. Tell me,\ndeserter, what news is there from the highprinces? Do they know of my\nplight here? Can I expect aid soon?”\nThey put him in charge, Moash thought, spotting other lighteyes. They\nwore fine clothing—not silks of course, but well-trimmed uniforms.\nExceptional boots. There was food aplenty set out at the side of this\nchamber, while those outside scrounged and did heavy labor.\nHe’d begun to hope … But of course that had been stupid. The arrival of\nthe Voidbringers hadn’t cast the lighteyes down; the few Moash had seen\noutside were merely the sacrifices. The fawning darkeyes at the periphery\nconfirmed this. Soldiers, guards, some favored merchants.\nTo Damnation with them! They’d been given a chance to escape from\nthe lighteyes, and it had only made them more eager to be servants! In that\nmoment—surrounded by the pettiness that was his own kind—Moash had a\nrevelation.\nHe wasn’t broken. All of them were broken. Alethi society—lighteyed\nand dark. Maybe all of humankind.\n“Well?” the regent demanded. “Speak up, man!”\nMoash remained silent, overwhelmed. He wasn’t the exception, always\nruining what he was given. Men like Kaladin were the exception—the very,\nvery rare exception.\nThese people proved it. There was no reason to obey lighteyes. They had\nno power, no authority. Men had taken opportunity and cast it to the crem.\n“I … I think there’s something wrong with him, Brightlord,” the guard\nsaid.\n“Yeah,” Guff added. “Should maybe have mentioned, he’s storming\nstrange in the head now, storming pisser.”\n“Bah!” the regent said, pointing at Moash. “Have that one thrown out.\nWe haven’t time for foolishness if we are to restore my place!” He pointed\nat Guff. “Have that one beaten, and post a competent guard next time, Ked,\nor you’ll be next!”\nOld Guff cried out as they seized him. Moash just nodded. Yes. Of\ncourse. That was what they would do.\nThe guards took him under the arms and dragged him to the side of the\ntent. They parted the cloth and hauled him out.

They passed a frazzled\nwoman trying to divide a single piece of flatbread between three young,\ncrying children. You could probably hear their weeping from the\nbrightlord’s tent, where he had a stack of bread piled high.\nThe guards threw him back out into the “street” that ran down the middle\nof the large bunker. They told him to stay away, but Moash barely heard. He\npicked himself up, dusted himself off, then walked to the third of the work\nstations—the one seeking hard laborers.\nThere, he volunteered for the most difficult job they had, pulling wagons\nof supplies for the Voidbringer army.\n46. When the Dream Dies\nDid you expect anything else from us? We need not suffer the\ninterference of another. Rayse is contained, and we care not for his\nprison.\nSkar the bridgeman ran up one of the ramps outside Urithiru, breath puffing\nin the cold air as he silently counted his steps to maintain focus. The air was\nthinner up here at Urithiru, and that made running harder, though he really\nonly noticed it outside.\nHe wore full marching pack and gear: rations, equipment, helmet, jerkin,\nand a shield tied to the back. He carried his spear, and even had some\ngreaves stuck to his legs, held in place by the shape of the metal. All of that\nweighed almost as much as he did.\nHe finally hit the top of the Oathgate platform. Storms, but the center\nbuilding looked farther away than he remembered. He tried to pick up his\npace anyway, and jogged for all he was worth, the pack clinking. Finally—\nsweating, breath growing ragged—he reached the control building and\ndashed inside. He finally pulled to a stop, dropping his spear and resting his\nhands on his knees, gasping for breath.\nMost of Bridge Four waited here, some glowing with Stormlight. Of\nthem all, Skar was the only one who—despite two weeks of practice—still\nhadn’t figured out how to draw it in. Well, except for Dabbid and Rlain.\nSigzil checked the clock they’d been allocated by Navani Kholin, a\ndevice the size of a small box. “That was about ten minutes,” he said. “Just\nunder.”\nSkar nodded, wiping his brow. He’d run over a mile from the center of\nthe market, then crossed the plateau and charged the ramp. Storms. He’d\npushed himself too hard.\n“How long,” he said, gasping, “how long did it take Drehy?” The two\nhad set out together.\nSigzil glanced at the tall, muscled bridgeman who still glowed with\nresidual Stormlight. “Under six minutes.”\nSkar groaned, sitting down.\n“The baseline is equally important, Skar,” Sigzil said, marking glyphs in\nhis notebook. “We need to know a normal man’s abilities to make\ncomparisons. Don’t worry though. I’m sure you’ll figure out Stormlight\nsoon.”\nSkar flopped backward, looking up. Lopen was walking around on the\nceiling of the room. Storming Herdazian."

Storming Herdazian.\n“Drehy, you used a quarter of a Basic Lashing, by Kaladin’s\nterminology?” Sigzil continued, still making notes.\n“Yeah,” Drehy said. “I … I know the precise amount, Sig. Strange.”\n“Which made you half as heavy as usual, when we put you on the scale\nback in the rooms. But why does a quarter Lashing make you half as heavy?\nShouldn’t it make you twenty-five percent as heavy?”\n“Does it matter?” Drehy asked.\nSigzil looked at him as if he were crazy. “Of course it does!”\n“I want to try a Lashing at an angle next,” Drehy said. “See if I can make\nit feel like I’m running downhill, no matter which direction I go. Might not\nneed it. Holding Stormlight … it made me feel like I could run forever.”\n“Well, it’s a new record…” Sigzil mumbled, still writing. “You beat\nLopen’s time.”\n“Did he beat mine?” Leyten called from the side of the small room\nwhere he was inspecting the tiling on the floor.\n“You stopped for food on the way, Leyten,” Sigzil said. “Even Rock beat\nyour time, and he was skipping like a girl the last third.”\n“Was Horneater dance of victory,” Rock said from near Leyten. “Is very\nmanly.”\n“Manly or not, it threw off my test,” Sigzil said. “At least Skar is willing\nto pay attention to proper procedure.”\nSkar remained lying on the ground as the others chatted—Kaladin was\nsupposed to come and transport them to the Shattered Plains, and Sigzil had\ndecided to run some tests. Kaladin, as usual, was late.\nTeft sat down next to Skar, inspecting him with dark green eyes with\nbags underneath. Kaladin had named the two of them lieutenants, along\nwith Rock and Sigzil, but their roles had never really settled into that\nranking. Teft was the perfect definition of a platoon sergeant.\n“Here,” Teft said, handing over a chouta—meatballs wrapped in\nflatbread, Herdazian style. “Leyten brought food. Eat something, lad.”\nSkar forced himself to sit up. “I’m not that much younger than you, Teft.\nI’m hardly a lad.”\nTeft nodded to himself, chewing on his own chouta. Finally, Skar started\ninto his. It was good, not spicy like a lot of Alethi food, but still good.\nFlavorful.\n“Everyone keeps telling me that I’ll ‘get it soon,’ ” Skar said. “But what\nif I don’t? There won’t be room in the Windrunners for a lieutenant who has\nto walk everywhere. I’ll end up cooking lunch with Rock.”\n“Ain’t nothing wrong with being on the support team.”\n“Pardon, Sarge, but storm that! Do you know how long I waited to hold\na spear?” Skar picked up the weapon from beside his pack and laid it across\nhis lap. “I’m good at it. I can fight. Only…”"

Only…”\nLopen left the ceiling, rotating to get his legs under him and floating\ngently to the floor. He laughed as Bisig in turn tried flying up to the ceiling\nand crashed headfirst into it. Bisig hopped to his feet, looking down at them\nall, embarrassed. But what did he have to be embarrassed about? He was\nstanding on the ceiling!\n“You were in the military before,” Teft guessed.\n“No, but not for lack of trying. You heard of the Blackcaps?”\n“Aladar’s personal guards.”\n“Let’s just say they didn’t think much of my application.”\nYes, we let darkeyes in. But not runts.\nTeft grunted, chewing on his chouta.\n“Said they might reconsider if I equipped myself,” Skar said. “Do you\nknow how much armor costs? I was a stupid rocksplitter with visions of\nbattlefield glory.”\nIt used to be they’d never speak about their pasts. That had changed,\nthough Skar couldn’t specify exactly when. It came out, as part of the\ncatharsis of having become something greater.\nTeft was an addict. Drehy had struck an officer. Eth had been caught\nplanning to desert with his brother. Even simple Hobber had been part of a\ndrunken brawl. Knowing Hobber, he’d probably only gone along with what\nhis squad was doing, but a man had ended up dead.\n“You’d think,” Teft said, “that our high and mighty leader would have\ngotten here by now. I swear, Kaladin acts more like a lighteyes every day.”\n“Don’t let him hear you say that,” Skar said.\n“I’ll say what I want,” Teft snapped. “If that boy’s not going to come,\nmaybe I should be going. I have things to do.”\nSkar hesitated, glancing up at Teft.\n“Not that,” Teft growled. “I’ve barely touched the stuff in days. You’d\nthink a man had never had a wild night out, the way you’re all treating me.”\n“Didn’t say a thing, Teft.”\n“Knowing what we’ve suffered, it’s insane to think that we wouldn’t\nneed something to get us through the day. The moss isn’t the problem. It’s\nthe storming world going all crazy. That’s the problem.”\n“Sure is, Teft.”\nTeft eyed him, then studied his chouta roll intently. “So … how long\nhave the men known? I mean, did anyone…”\n“Not long,” Skar said quickly. “Nobody’s even thinking about it.”\nTeft nodded, and didn’t see through the lie. Truth was, most of them had\nnoticed Teft sneaking off to grind a little moss now and then. It wasn’t\nuncommon in the army. But doing what he’d done—missing duty, selling\nhis uniform, ending up in an alley—that was different. It was the sort of\nthing that could get you discharged, at best. At worst … well, it might get\nyou assigned to bridge duty.\nTrouble was, they weren’t common soldiers anymore. They weren’t\nlighteyes either. They were something strange, something that nobody\nunderstood."

They were something strange, something that nobody\nunderstood.\n“I don’t want to talk about this,” Teft said. “Look, weren’t we discussing\nhow to get you to glow? That’s the problem at hand.”\nBefore he could press further, Kaladin Stormblessed finally deigned to\narrive, bringing with him the scouts and hopefuls from other bridge crews\nwho had been trying to draw in Stormlight. So far, nobody except men from\nBridge Four had managed it, but that included a few that had never actually\nrun bridges: Huio and Punio—Lopen’s cousins—and men like Koen from\nthe old Cobalt Guard, who had been recruited into Bridge Four a couple\nmonths back. So there was still hope that others could manage it.\nKaladin had brought roughly thirty people beyond those who had already\nbeen training with the team. Judging by their uniform patches, this thirty\nhad come from other divisions—and some were lighteyed. Kaladin had\nmentioned asking General Khal to round up the most promising potential\nrecruits from throughout the Alethi army.\n“All here?” Kaladin said. “Good.” He strode to the side of the single-\nroomed control building, a sack of glowing gemstones slung over his\nshoulder. His magnificent Shardblade appeared in his hand, and he slid it\ninto the keyhole in the chamber wall.\nKaladin engaged the ancient mechanism, pushing the sword—and the\nentire inner wall, which could rotate—toward a specific point marked by\nmurals. The floor began to glow, and outside, Stormlight rose in a swirl\naround the entire stone plateau.\nKaladin locked the Blade into place at the mark on the floor designating\nthe Shattered Plains. When the glow faded, they’d come to Narak.\nSigzil left his pack and armor leaning against the wall, and strode out.\nBest they could determine, the entire stone top of the platform had come\nwith them, swapping places with the one that had been out here.\nAt the platform edge, a group of people climbed across a ramp to meet\nthem. A short Alethi woman named Ristina counted out the bridgemen and\nsoldiers as they passed, marking on her ledger.\n“Took you long enough, Brightlord,” she noted to Kaladin—whose eyes\nglowed faintly blue. “The merchants were beginning to complain.”\nIt took Stormlight to power the device—some of the gemstones in\nKaladin’s sack would have been drained by the process—but curiously, it\ndidn’t take much more to swap two groups than it did to travel one way. So\nthey tried to run the Oathgates when they had people on both sides wanting\nto exchange places.\n“Tell the merchants when they next come through,” Kaladin said, “that\nthe Knights Radiant are not their doormen. They’ll want to accustom\nthemselves to waiting, unless they find a way to swear the oaths\nthemselves.”\nRistina smirked and wrote it down, as if she were going to pass on that\nexact message.

Nice to see a scribe with a sense of\nhumor.\nKaladin led the way through the city of Narak, once a Parshendi\nstronghold, now an increasingly important human waystop between the\nwarcamps and Urithiru. The buildings here were surprisingly sturdy: well\nconstructed of crem and carved greatshell carapace. Skar had always\nassumed the Parshendi to be like the nomads who roved between Azir and\nJah Keved. He imagined Parshendi who were wild and ferocious, without\ncivilization, hiding in caves for storms.\nYet here was a well-built, carefully laid-out city. They’d found a building\nfull of artwork of a style that baffled the Alethi scribes. Parshman art.\nThey’d been painting even while they fought a war. Just like … well, just\nlike ordinary people.\nHe glanced at Shen—no, Rlain, it was hard to remember—walking with\nspear to his shoulder. Skar forgot he was there most of the time, and that\nmade him ashamed. Rlain was as much a member of Bridge Four as anyone\nelse, right? Would he rather have been painting than fighting?\nThey passed sentry posts full of Dalinar’s soldiers, along with many in\nred and light blue. Ruthar’s colors. Dalinar was putting some of the other\nsoldiers to work, trying to prevent more dustups between soldiers from\ndifferent princedoms. Without the fighting on the Shattered Plains to keep\nthem focused, the men were getting restless.\nThey passed a large group of soldiers practicing with bridges on a nearby\nplateau. Skar couldn’t hold back a grin as he saw their black uniforms and\nhelms. Plateau runs had been started again, but with more structure, and the\nspoils were shared equally among the highprinces.\nToday, it was the Blackcaps’ turn. Skar wondered if any of them would\nrecognize him. Probably not, even if he had caused quite a ruckus among\nthem. There had been only one logical way to get the equipment he needed\nfor his application: He’d stolen it from the Blackcap quartermaster.\nSkar had thought they would praise his ingenuity. He was so eager to be\na Blackcap that he’d go to great lengths to join them, right?\nWrong. His reward had been a slave brand and eventual sale to Sadeas’s\narmy.\nHe brushed his fingers across the scars on his forehead. Stormlight had\nhealed the brands of the other men—they’d covered them all up with tattoos\nanyway—but it seemed another little dig, dividing him from the others.\nRight now, he was the only fighting man in Bridge Four who still had his\nslave brand.\nWell, him and Kaladin, whose scars wouldn’t heal for some reason.\nThey reached the training plateau, crossing the old Bridge Four, which\nwas held in place with some Soulcast rock guideposts. Kaladin called a\nmeeting of the officers as several of Rock’s children set up a water station.\nThe tall Horneater seemed beyond enthused to have his family working\nwith him.\nSkar joined Kaladin, Sigzil, Teft, and Rock.

Perhaps I should have.”\n“Don’t see why, sir,” Skar said, pointing. “That’s Captain Colot—good\nman. He helped us explore.”\n“Just wouldn’t feel right, having lighteyed men in Bridge Four.”\n“Other than you?” Skar asked. “And Renarin. And, well, any of us who\nearn our own Blades, and maybe Rock, who I think might have been\nlighteyed among his people, even if he has dark—”\n“Fine, Skar,” Kaladin said. “Point made. Anyway, we don’t have a lot of\ntime left before I leave with Elhokar. I’d like to push the recruits harder, see\nif they’re likely to be able to swear the oaths. Any thoughts?”\n“Shove them off edge of plateau,” Rock said. “Those who fly, we let in.”\n“Any serious suggestions?” Kaladin asked.\n“Let me run them through some formations,” Teft said.\n“A good idea,” Kaladin said. “Storms, I wish we knew how the Radiants\nused to handle expansion. Were there recruitment drives, or did they just\nwait until someone attracted a spren?”\n“That wouldn’t make them a squire though,” Teft said, rubbing his chin.\n“But a full Radiant, right?”\n“A valid point,” Sigzil said. “We have no proof that we squires are a step\ntoward becoming full Radiants. We might always be your support team—\nand in that case, it’s not individual skill that matters, but your decision.\nMaybe that of your spren. You choose them, they serve under you, and then\nthey start drawing in Stormlight.”\n“Yeah,” Skar said, uncomfortable.\nThey all glanced at him.\n“The first of you that says something placating,” Skar said, “gets a fist in\nthe face. Or the stomach, if I can’t reach your storming stupid Horneater\nface.”\n“Ha!” Rock said. “You could hit my face, Skar. I have seen you jump\nvery high. Almost, you seem as tall as regular person when you do that.”\n“Teft,” Kaladin said, “go ahead and run those potential recruits through\nformations. And tell the rest of the men to watch the sky; I’m worried about\nmore raids on the caravans.” He shook his head. “Something about those\nraids doesn’t add up.

They\nwon’t have the troops to take advantage of any supply problems they\ncause.”\nSkar shared a glance with Sigzil, who shrugged. Kaladin talked like this\nsometimes, differently from the rest of them. He’d trained them in\nformations and the spear, and they could proudly call themselves soldiers.\nBut they’d only actually fought a few times. What did they know of things\nlike strategy and battlefield tactics?\nThey broke, Teft jogging off to drill the potential recruits. Kaladin set\nBridge Four to studying their flying. They practiced landings, and then did\nsprints in the air, zipping back and forth in formation, getting used to\nchanging directions quickly. It was a little distracting, seeing those glowing\nlines of light shoot through the sky.\nSkar attended Kaladin as he observed the recruits doing formations. The\nlighteyes didn’t voice a single complaint about being filed into ranks with\ndarkeyes. Kaladin and Teft … well, all of them really … had a tendency to\nact as if every lighteyed man was in some way regal. But there were far, far\nmore of them who did normal jobs—though granted, they got paid better\nfor those jobs than a darkeyed man did.\nKaladin watched, then glanced at the Bridge Four men in the sky. “I\nwonder, Skar,” he said. “How important are formations going to be for us,\ngoing forward? Can we devise new ones to use in flying? Everything\nchanges when your enemy can attack from all sides.…”\nAfter about an hour, Skar went for water, and enjoyed some good-\nnatured ribbing from the others, who landed to grab something to drink. He\ndidn’t mind. What you had to watch out for was when Bridge Four didn’t\ntorment you.\nThe others took off a short time later, and Skar watched them go,\nlaunching into the sky. He took a long draught of Rock’s current\nrefreshment—he called it tea, but it tasted like boiled grain—and found\nhimself feeling useless. Were these people, these new recruits, going to start\nglowing and take his place in Bridge Four? Would he be shuffled off to\nother duties, while someone else laughed with the crew and got ribbed for\ntheir height?\nStorm it, he thought, tossing aside his cup. I hate feeling sorry for myself.\nHe hadn’t sulked when the Blackcaps had turned him down, and he\nwouldn’t sulk now.\nHe was fishing in his pocket for gemstones, determined to practice some\nmore, when he spotted Lyn sitting on a rock nearby, watching the recruits\nrun formations. She was slouching, and he read frustration in her posture.\nWell, he knew that feeling.\nSkar shouldered his spear and sauntered over. The four other scout\nwomen had gone to the water station; Rock let out a bellowing laugh at\nwhat one of them said.\n“Not joining in?” Skar asked, nodding toward the new recruits marching\npast.\n“I don’t know formations, Skar.

Kaladin just wants to have as many potential recruits\nas possible.”\nShe shook her head. “Everyone knows that we’re in a new world now—\na world where rank and eye color don’t matter. Something glorious.” She\nlooked up at the sky, and the men training there. “I want to be part of it,\nSkar. So badly.”\n“Yeah.”\nShe looked at him, and probably saw it in his eyes. That same emotion.\n“Storms. I hadn’t even thought, Skar. Must be worse for you.”\nHe shrugged and reached into his pouch, taking out an emerald as big as\nhis thumb. It shone fiercely, even in the bright daylight. “You ever hear\nabout the first time Captain Stormblessed drew in Light?”\n“He told us. That day, after he knew he could do it because Teft told him.\nAnd—”\n“Not that day.”\n“You mean while he was healing,” she said. “After the highstorm where\nhe was strung up.”\n“Not that day either,” Skar said, holding up the gemstone.

The Parshendi wanted to take\ndown our bridge, and they focused their shots on us. On me. I knew I was\ndead. I knew it. I saw the arrows coming, and I breathed a last prayer,\nhoping the next life wouldn’t be quite so bad.\n“Then … then the arrows moved, Lyn. They storming swerved toward\nKaladin.” He turned the emerald over, and shook his head. “There’s a\nspecial Lashing you can do, which makes things curve in the air. Kaladin\npainted the wood above his hands with Stormlight and drew the arrows\ntoward him, instead of me. That’s the first time I can say I knew something\nspecial was happening.” He lowered the gemstone and pressed it into her\nhand. “Back then, Kaladin did it without even knowing what he was doing.\nMaybe we’re just trying too hard, you know?”\n“But it doesn’t make sense! They say you have to suck it in. What does\nthat even mean?”\n“No idea,” Skar said. “They each describe it differently, and it’s breaking\nmy brain trying to figure it out. They talk about a sharp intake of breath—\nonly, not really for breathing.”\n“Which is perfectly clear.”\n“Tell me about it,” Skar said, tapping the gemstone in her palm. “It\nworked best for Kaladin when he didn’t stress. It was harder when he"

It was harder when he\nfocused on making it happen.”\n“So I’m supposed to accidently but deliberately breathe something in\nwithout breathing, but not try too hard at it?”\n“Doesn’t it just make you want to string the lot of them up in the storms?\nBut their advice is all we got. So…”\nShe looked at the stone, then held it close to her face—that didn’t seem\nto be important, but what could it hurt—and breathed in. Nothing happened,\nso she tried again. And again. For a solid ten minutes.\n“I don’t know, Skar,” she finally said, lowering the stone. “I keep\nthinking, maybe I don’t belong here. If you haven’t noticed, none of the\nwomen have managed this. I kind of forced my way among you all, and\nnobody asked—”\n“Stop,” he said, taking the emerald and holding it before her again. “Stop\nright there. You want to be a Windrunner?”\n“More than anything,” she whispered.\n“Why?”\n“Because I want to soar.”\n“Not good enough. Kaladin, he wasn’t thinking about being left out, or\nhow great it would be to fly. He was thinking about saving the rest of us.\nSaving me. Why do you want to be in the Windrunners?”\n“Because I want to help! I want to do something other than stand around,\nwaiting for the enemy to come to us!”\n“Well, you have a chance, Lyn. A chance nobody has had for ages, a\nchance in millions. Either you seize it, and in so doing decide you’re\nworthy, or you leave and give up.” He pressed the gemstone back down into\nher hand. “But if you leave, you don’t get to complain. As long as you keep\ntrying, there’s a chance. When you give up? That’s when the dream dies.”\nShe met his eyes, closed her fist around the gemstone, and breathed in\nwith a sharp, distinct breath.\nThen started glowing.\nShe yelped in surprise and opened her hand to find the gemstone within\ndun. She looked at him in awe. “What did you do?”\n“Nothing,” Skar said. Which was the problem. Still, he found he couldn’t\nbe jealous. Maybe this was his lot, helping others become Radiants. A\ntrainer, a facilitator?\nTeft saw Lyn glowing, then dashed over and started cursing—but they\nwere “good” Teft curses. He grabbed her by the arm and towed her toward\nKaladin.\nSkar took in a long, satisfied breath. Well, that was two he’d helped so\nfar, counting Rock. He … he could live with that, couldn’t he?\nHe strolled over to the drink station and got another cup. “What is this\nfoul stuff, Rock?” he asked. “You didn’t mistake the washing water for tea,\ndid you?”\n“Is old Horneater recipe,” he said. “Has proud tradition.”\n“Like skipping?”\n“Like formal war dance,” he said. “And hitting annoying bridgemen on\nhead for not showing proper respect.”\nSkar turned around and leaned one hand on the table, watching Lyn’s"

He felt good about what\nhe’d done—strangely good. Excited, even.\n“I think I’m going to have to get used to smelly Horneaters, Rock,” Skar\nsaid. “I’m thinking of joining your support team.”\n“You think I will let you anywhere near cook pot?”\n“I might not ever learn to fly.” He squished the part of him that\nwhimpered at that. “I need to come to terms with the fact. So, I’ll have to\nfind another way to help out.”\n“Ha. And the fact that you are glowing with Stormlight right now is not\nat all consideration in decision?”\nSkar froze. Then he focused on his hand, right in front of his face,\nholding a cup. Tiny wisps of Stormlight curled off it. He dropped the cup\nwith a cry, digging from his pocket a couple of dun chips. He’d given his\npractice gemstone to Lyn.\nHe looked up at Rock, then grinned stupidly.\n“I suppose,” Rock said, “I can maybe have you wash dishes. Though you\ndo keep throwing my cups on ground.

The\nabandoned Herald had come to Kholinar—and had been dismissed as a\nmadman.\nShe leaned back in her seat and Ivory—full-sized, like a human—\nstepped over to the table. Hands clasped behind his back, he wore his usual\nstiff formal suit. The spren’s coloring was jet black, both clothing and\nfeatures, though something prismatic swirled on his skin. It was as if pure\nblack marble had been coated in oil that glistened with hidden color. He\nrubbed his chin, reading the words.\nJasnah had rejected the nice rooms with balconies on the rim of Urithiru;\nthose had such an obvious entrance for assassins or spies. Her small room at\nthe center of Dalinar’s section was far more secure. She had stuffed the\nventilation openings with cloth. The airflow from the hallway outside was\nadequate for this room, and she wanted to make sure nobody could overhear\nher by listening through the shafts.\nIn the corner of her room, three spanreeds worked tirelessly. She had\nrented them at great expense, until she could acquire new ones of her own.\nThey were paired with reeds in Tashikk that had been delivered to one of\nthe finest—and most trustworthy—information centers in the princedom.\nThere, miles and miles away, a scribe was carefully rewriting each page of\nher notes, which she had originally sent to them to keep safe.\n“This speaker, Jasnah,” Ivory said, tapping the sheet she’d just read.\nIvory had a clipped, no-nonsense voice. “This one who said these words.\nThis person is a Herald. Our suspicions are true. The Heralds are, and the\nfallen one still is.”\n“We need to find him,” Jasnah said.\n“We must search Shadesmar,” Ivory said. “In this world, men can hide\neasily—but their souls shine out to us on the other side.”\n“Unless someone knows how to hide them.”\nIvory looked toward the growing stack of notes in the corner; one of the\npens had finished writing. Jasnah rose to change the paper; Shallan had\nrescued one of her trunks of notes, but two others had gone down with the\nsinking ship. Fortunately, Jasnah had sent off these backup copies.\nOr did it matter? This sheet, encrypted by her cipher, contained lines and\nlines of information connecting the parshmen to the Voidbringers. Once,\nshe’d slaved over each of these passages, teasing them from history. Now\ntheir contents were common knowledge. In one moment, all of her expertise\nhad been wiped away.\n“We’ve lost so much time,” she said.\n“Yes. We must catch what we have lost, Jasnah. We must.”\n“The enemy?” Jasnah asked.\n“He stirs. He angers.” Ivory shook his head, kneeling beside her as she\nchanged the sheets of paper. “We are naught before him, Jasnah. He would\ndestroy my kind and yours.”\nThe spanreed finished, and another started writing out the first lines of\nher memoirs, which she’d worked on intermittently throughout her life.\nShe’d thrown aside a dozen different attempts, and as she read this latest"

His sharply chiseled features, too\nangular to be human, were like those of a roughed-out statue the sculptor\nhad neglected to finish.\n“She … is troubling,” he said.\n“That much hasn’t changed.”\n“She is not stable.”\n“Ivory, you think all humans are unstable.”\n“Not you,” he said, lifting his chin. “You are like a spren. You think by\nfacts. You change not on simple whims. You are as you are.”\nShe gave him a flat stare.\n“Mostly,” he added. “Mostly. But it is, Jasnah. Compared to other\nhumans, you are practically a stone!”\nShe sighed, standing up and brushing past him, returning to her writing\ndesk. The Herald’s ravings glared at her. She settled down, feeling tired.\n“Jasnah?” Ivory asked. “Am I … in error?”\n“I am not so much a stone as you think, Ivory. Sometimes I wish I were.”\n“These words trouble you,” he said, stepping up to her again and resting\nhis jet-black fingers on the paper. “Why? You have read many troubling\nthings.”\nJasnah settled back, listening to the three spanreeds scratching paper,\nwriting out notes that—she feared—would mostly be irrelevant. Something\nstirred deep within her. Glimmers of memory from a dark room, screaming\nher voice ragged. A childhood illness nobody else seemed to remember, for\nall it had done to her.\nIt had taught her that people she loved could still hurt her.\n“Have you ever wondered how it would feel to lose your sanity, Ivory?”\nIvory nodded. “I have wondered this. How could I not? Considering\nwhat the ancient fathers are.”\n“You call me logical,” Jasnah whispered. “It’s untrue, as I let my\npassions rule me as much as many. In my times of peace, however, my\nmind has always been the one thing I could rely upon.”\nExcept once.\nShe shook her head, picking up the paper again. “I fear losing that, Ivory.\nIt terrifies me. How would it have felt, to be these Heralds? To suffer your\nmind slowly becoming untrustworthy? Are they too far gone to know? Or\nare there lucid moments, where they strain and sort through memories …\ntrying frantically to decide which are reliable and which are fabrications…”\nShe shivered.\n“The ancient ones,” Ivory said again, nodding. He didn’t often speak of\nthe spren who had been lost during the Recreance. Ivory and his fellows had\nbeen mere children—well, the spren equivalent—at the time. They spent\nyears, centuries, with no older spren to nurture and guide them. The\ninkspren were only now beginning to recover the culture and society they\nhad lost when men abandoned their vows.\n“Your ward,” Ivory said. “Her spren. A Cryptic.”\n“Which is bad?”"

A Cryptic.”\n“Which is bad?”\nIvory nodded. He preferred simple, straightforward gestures. You never\nsaw Ivory shrug. “Cryptics are trouble. They enjoy lies, Jasnah. Feast upon\nthem. Speak one word untrue at a gathering, and seven cluster around you.\nTheir humming fills your ears.”\n“Have you warred with them?”\n“One does not war with Cryptics, as one does honorspren. Cryptics have\nbut one city, and do not wish to rule more. Only to listen.” He tapped the\ntable. “Perhaps this one is better, with the bond.”\nIvory was the only new-generation inkspren to form a Radiant bond.\nSome of his fellows would rather have killed Jasnah, instead of letting him\nrisk what he had done.\nThe spren had a noble air about him, stiff-backed and commanding. He\ncould change his size at will, but not his shape, except when fully in this\nrealm, manifesting as a Shardblade. He had taken the name Ivory as a\nsymbol of defiance. He was not what his kin said he was, and would not\nsuffer what fate proclaimed.\nThe difference between a higher spren like him and a common emotion\nspren was in their ability to decide how to act. A living contradiction. Like\nhuman beings.\n“Shallan won’t listen to me any longer,” Jasnah said. “She rebels against\nevery little thing I tell her. These last few months on her own have changed\nthe child.”\n“She never obeyed well, Jasnah. That is who she is.”\n“In the past, at least she pretended to care about my teaching.”\n“But you have said, more humans should question their places in life.\nDid you not say that they too often accept presumed truth as fact?”\nShe tapped the table. “You’re right, of course. Wouldn’t I rather have her\nstraining against her boundaries, as opposed to happily living within them?\nWhether she obeys me or not is of little import. But I do worry about her\nability to command her situation, rather than letting her impulses command\nher.”\n“How do you change this, if it is?”\nAn excellent question. Jasnah searched through the papers on her small\ntable. She’d been collecting reports from her informants in the warcamps—\nthe ones who had survived—about Shallan. She’d truly done well in\nJasnah’s absence. Perhaps what the child needed was not more structure,\nbut more challenges.\n“All ten orders are again,” Ivory said from behind her. For years it had\nbeen only the two of them, Jasnah and Ivory. Ivory had been dodgy about\ngiving odds on whether the other sapient spren would refound their orders\nor not.\nHowever, he’d always said that he was certain that the honorspren—and\ntherefore the Windrunners—would never return. Their attempts to rule\nShadesmar had apparently not endeared them to the other races.\n“Ten orders,” Jasnah said. “All ended in death.”\n“All but one,” Ivory agreed. “They lived in death instead.”\nShe turned around, and he met her eyes with his own.

Rhythm of Work\nBut we stand in the sea, pleased with our domains. Leave us alone.\nMoash grunted as he crossed the uneven ground, hauling a thick, knotted\ncord over his shoulder. Turned out, the Voidbringers had run out of wagons.\nToo many supplies to bring, and not enough vehicles.\nAt least, vehicles with wheels.\nMoash had been assigned to a sledge—a cart with broken wheels that\nhad been repurposed with a pair of long, steel skids. They’d put him first in\nthe line pulling their rope. The parshman overseers had considered him the\nmost enthusiastic.\nWhy wouldn’t he be? The caravans moved at the slow pace of the chulls,\nwhich pulled roughly half the ordinary wagons. He had sturdy boots, and\neven a pair of gloves. Compared to bridge duty, this was a paradise.\nThe scenery was even better. Central Alethkar was far more fertile than\nthe Shattered Plains, and the ground sprouted with rockbuds and the gnarled\nroots of trees. The sledge bounced and crunched over these, but at least he\ndidn’t have to carry the thing on his shoulders.\nAround him, hundreds of men pulled wagons or sledges piled high with\nfoodstuffs, freshly cut lumber, or leather made from hogshide or eelskin.\nSome of the workers had collapsed on their first day out of Revolar. The\nVoidbringers had separated these into two groups. The ones who had tried,\nbut were genuinely too weak, had been sent back to the city. A few deemed\nto be faking had been whipped, then moved to sledges instead of wagons.\nHarsh, but fair. Indeed, as the march continued, Moash was surprised at\nhow well the human workers were treated. Though strict and unforgiving,\nthe Voidbringers understood that to work hard, slaves needed good rations\nand plenty of time at night to rest. They weren’t even chained up. Running\naway would be pointless under the watchful care of Fused who could fly.\nMoash found himself enjoying these weeks hiking and pulling his\nsledge. It exhausted his body, quieted his thoughts, and let him fall into a\ncalm rhythm. This was certainly far better than his days as a lighteyes,\nwhen he’d worried incessantly about the plot against the king.\nIt felt good to just be told what to do.\nWhat happened at the Shattered Plains wasn’t my fault, he thought as he\nhauled the sledge.

He’d\nwalked this path dozens of times, running caravans with his uncle even\nwhen he’d been a youth. Across the river, straight southeast. Over Ishar’s\nField and cutting past the town of Inkwell.\nThe Voidbringers were marching to take Kholinar. The caravan included\ntens of thousands of parshmen armed with axes or spears. They wore what\nMoash now knew was called warform: a parshman form with carapace\narmor and a strong physique. They weren’t experienced—watching their\nnightly training told him they were basically the equivalent of darkeyes\nscrounged from villages and pressed into the army.\nBut they were learning, and they had access to the Fused. Those zipped\nthrough the air or strode along beside carts, powerful and imperious—and\nsurrounded by dark energy. There seemed to be different varieties, but each\nwas intimidating.\nEverything was converging on the capital. Should that bother him? After\nall, what had Kholinar ever done for him? It was the place where his\ngrandparents had been left to die, cold and alone in a prison cell. It was\nwhere the blighted King Elhokar had danced and connived while good\npeople rotted.\nDid humankind even deserve this kingdom?\nDuring his youth, he’d listened to traveling ardents who accompanied\nthe caravans. He knew that long ago, humankind had won. Aharietiam, the\nfinal confrontation with the Voidbringers, had happened thousands of years\nago.\nWhat had they done with that victory? They’d set up false gods in the\nform of men whose eyes reminded them of the Knights Radiant. The life of\nmen over the centuries had been nothing more than a long string of\nmurders, wars, and thefts.\nThe Voidbringers had obviously returned because men had proven they\ncouldn’t govern themselves. That was why the Almighty had sent this\nscourge.\nIndeed, the more he marched, the more Moash admired the Voidbringers.\nThe armies were efficient, and the troops learned quickly. The caravans\nwere well supplied; when an overseer saw that Moash’s boots were looking\nworn, he had a new pair by evening.\nEach wagon or sledge was given two parshman overseers, but these were\ntold to use their whips sparingly. They were quietly trained for the position,\nand Moash heard the occasional conversation between an overseer—once a\nparshman slave—and an unseen spren who gave them directions.\nThe Voidbringers were smart, driven, and efficient. If Kholinar fell to\nthis force, it would be no more than humankind deserved. Yes … perhaps\nthe time for his people had passed. Moash had failed Kaladin and the others\n—but that was merely how men were in this debased age. He couldn’t be\nblamed. He was a product of his culture.\nOnly one oddity marred his observations.

They wore workform, not warform—though otherwise they looked\nexactly like the other parshmen, with the same marbled skin. Why did this\ngroup pull a sledge?\nAt first, as Moash plodded across the endless plains of central Alethkar,\nhe found the sight of them encouraging. It suggested that the Voidbringers\ncould be egalitarian. Maybe there’d simply been too few men with the\nstrength to pull these sledges.\nYet if that were so, why were these parshman sledge-pullers treated so\npoorly? The overseers did little to hide their disgust, and were allowed to\nwhip the poor creatures without restriction. Moash rarely glanced in their\ndirection without finding one of them being beaten, yelled at, or abused.\nMoash’s heart wrenched to see and hear this. Everyone else seemed to\nwork so well together; everything else about the army seemed so perfect.\nExcept this.\nWho were these poor souls?\n* * *\nThe overseer called a break, and Moash dropped his rope, then took a long\npull on his waterskin. It was their twenty-first day of marching, which he\nonly knew because some of the other slaves kept track. He judged the\nlocation as several days past Inkwell, in the final stretch toward Kholinar.\nHe ignored the other slaves and settled down in the shade of the sledge,\nwhich was piled high with cut timber. Not far behind them, a village\nburned. There hadn’t been anyone in it, as word had run before them. Why\nhad the Voidbringers burned it, but not others they’d passed? Perhaps it was\nto send a message—indeed, that smoke trail was ominous. Or perhaps it\nwas to prevent any potential flanking armies from using the village.\nAs his crew waited—Moash didn’t know their names, and hadn’t\nbothered to ask—the parshman crew trudged past, bloodied and whipped,\ntheir overseers yelling them onward. They’d lagged behind. Pervasive cruel\ntreatment led to a tired crew, which in turn led to them being forced to\nmarch to catch up when everyone else got a water break. That, of course,\nonly wore them out and caused injuries—which made them lag farther\nbehind, which made them get whipped …\nThat’s what happened to Bridge Four, back before Kaladin, Moash\nthought. Everyone said we were unlucky, but it was just a self-perpetuating\ndownward spiral.\nOnce that crew passed, trailing a few exhaustionspren, one of Moash’s\noverseers called for his team to take up their ropes and get moving again.\nShe was a young parshwoman with dark red skin, marbled only slightly\nwith white. She wore a havah. Though it didn’t seem like marching\nclothing, she wore it well. She had even done up the sleeve to cover her\nsafehand.\n“What’d they do, anyway?” he said as he took up his rope.\n“What was that?” she asked, looking back at him. Storms.

But the parshwoman followed his\ngaze, then shook her head. “They harbored a false god. Brought him into\nthe very center among us.”\n“The Almighty?”\nShe laughed. “A real false god, a living one. Like our living gods.” She\nlooked up as one of the Fused passed overhead.\n“There are lots who think the Almighty is real,” Moash said.\n“If that’s the case, why are you pulling a sledge?” She snapped her\nfingers, pointing.\nMoash picked up his rope, joining the other men in a double line. They\nmerged with the enormous column of marching feet, scraping sledges, and\nrattling wheels. The Parshendi wanted to arrive at the next town before an\nimpending storm. They’d weathered both types—highstorm and Everstorm\n—sheltering in villages along the way.\nMoash fell into the sturdy rhythm of the work. It wasn’t long until he\nwas sweating. He’d grown accustomed to the colder weather in the east,\nnear the Frostlands. It was strange to be in a place where the sun felt hot on\nhis skin, and now the weather here was turning toward summer.\nHis sledge soon caught up to the parshman crew. The two sledges\nwalked side by side for a time, and Moash liked to think that keeping pace\nwith his crew could motivate the poor parshmen. Then one of them slipped\nand fell, and the entire team lurched to a stop.\nThe whipping began. The cries, the crack of leather on skin.\nThat’s enough.\nMoash dropped his rope and stepped out of the line. His shocked\noverseers called after him, but didn’t follow. Perhaps they were too\nsurprised.\nHe strode up to the parshman sledge, where the slaves were struggling to\npull themselves back up and start again. Several had bloodied faces and\nbacks. The large parshman who had slipped lay curled on the ground. His\nfeet were bleeding; no wonder he’d had trouble walking.\nTwo overseers were whipping him. Moash seized one by the shoulder\nand pushed him back. “Stop it!” he snapped, then shoved the other overseer\naside. “Don’t you see what you’re doing?

He shook his hand, which had clipped carapace on the\nside as he’d connected. He glared at the other overseer, who yelped and\ndropped his whip, jumping backward.\nMoash nodded once, then took the fallen slave by the arm and pulled\nhim upright. “Ride in the sledge. Heal those feet.” He took the parshman\nslave’s place in line, and pulled the rope taut over his shoulder.\nBy now, his own overseers had gathered their wits and chased after him.\nThey conferred with the two that he’d confronted, one nursing a bleeding\ncut around his eye. Their conversation was hushed, urgent, and punctuated\nby intimidated glances toward him.\nFinally, they decided to let it be. Moash pulled the sledge with the\nparshmen, and they found someone to replace him on the other sledge. For\na while he thought more would come of it—he even saw one of the\noverseers conferring with a Fused. But they didn’t punish him.\nNo one dared to again raise a whip against the parshman crew the rest of\nthe march.\n49. Born unto Light\nTWENTY-THREE YEARS AGO\nDalinar pressed his fingers together, then rubbed them, scraping the dry,\nred-brown moss against itself. The scratchy sound was unpleasantly similar\nto that of a knife along bone.\nHe felt the warmth immediately, like an ember. A thin plume of smoke\nrose from his callused fingers and struck below his nose, then parted around\nhis face.\nEverything faded: the raucous sound of too many men in one room, the\nmusky smell of their bodies pressed together. Euphoria spread through him\nlike sudden sunlight on a cloudy day. He released a protracted sigh. He\ndidn’t even mind when Bashin accidentally elbowed him.\nMost places, being highprince would have won him a bubble of space,\nbut at the stained wooden table in this poorly lit den, social standing was\nirrelevant. Here, with a good drink and a little help pressed between his\nfingers, he could finally relax. Here nobody cared how presentable he was,\nor if he drank too much.\nHere, he didn’t have to listen to reports of rebellion and imagine himself\nout on those fields, solving problems the direct way. Sword in hand, Thrill\nin his heart …\nHe rubbed the moss more vigorously. Don’t think about war. Just live in\nthe moment, as Evi always said.\nHavar returned with drinks. The lean, bearded man studied the\novercrowded bench, then set the drinks down and hauled a slumped drunk\nout of his spot. He squeezed in beside Bashin. Havar was lighteyed, good\nfamily too. He’d been one of Dalinar’s elites back when that had meant\nsomething, though now he had his own land and a high commission. He\nwas one of the few who didn’t salute Dalinar so hard you could hear it.\nBashin though … well, Bashin was an odd one.

He still wore that stupid, wide-brimmed\nfloppy hat.\nHavar grunted, passing down the drinks. “Squeezing in beside you,\nBashin, would be far easier if you didn’t have a gut that stretched to next\nweek.”\n“Just trying to do my duty, Brightlord.”\n“Your duty?”\n“Lighteyes need folks to obey them, right? I’m making certain that you\ngot lots to serve you, at least by weight.”\nDalinar took his mug, but didn’t drink. For now, the firemoss was doing\nits job. His wasn’t the only plume rising in the dim stone chamber.\nGavilar hated the stuff. But then, Gavilar liked his life now.\nIn the center of the dim room, a pair of parshmen pushed tables aside,\nthen started setting diamond chips on the floor. Men backed away, making\nspace for a large ring of light. A couple of shirtless men pushed their way\nthrough the crowd. The room’s general air of clumsy conversation turned to\none of roaring excitement.\n“Are we going to bet?” Havar asked.\n“Sure,” Bashin replied. “I’ll put three garnet marks on the shorter one.”\n“I’ll take that bet,” Havar said, “but not for the money. If I win, I want\nyour hat.”\n“Deal! Ha! So you’re finally going to admit how dashing it is?”\n“Dashing? Storms, Bashin. I’m going to do you a favor and burn the\nthing.”\nDalinar sat back, mind dulled by the firemoss.\n“Burn my hat?” Bashin said. “Storms, Havar. That’s harsh. Just because\nyou envy my dashing profile.”\n“The only thing dashing about that hat is how it makes women run the\nother way.”\n“It’s exotic. From the west. Everyone knows fashion comes from the\nwest.”\n“Yeah, from Liafor and Yezier. Where did you get that hat again?”\n“The Purelake.”\n“Ah, that bastion of culture and fashion! Are you going shopping in\nBavland next?”\n“Barmaids don’t know the difference,” Bashin grumbled. “Anyway, can\nwe just watch the match? I’m looking forward to winning those marks off\nyou.” He took a drink, but fingered his hat anxiously.\nDalinar closed his eyes. He felt as if he could drift off, maybe get some\nsleep without worrying about Evi, or dreaming of war.…\nIn the ring, bodies smacked against each other.\nThat sound—the grunts of exertion as the wrestlers tried to push each\nother from the ring—reminded him of the battle. Dalinar opened his eyes,\ndropped the moss, and leaned forward.\nThe shorter wrestler danced out of the other’s grip. They revolved\naround one another, crouched, hands at the ready. When they locked again,\nthe shorter man pushed his opponent off balance. Better stance, Dalinar\nthought. Kept himself low. That taller fellow has gotten by too long on his\nstrength and size.

Havar sighed, but rolled a few glowing spheres to\nBashin. “Double or nothing on the next bout?”\n“Nah,” Bashin said, hefting the marks. “This should be enough.”\n“For what?”\n“To bribe a few influential young dandies into trying hats like mine,”\nBashin said. “I tell you, once word gets out, everyone is going to be wearing\nthem.”\n“You’re an idiot.”\n“So long as I’m a fashionable one.”\nDalinar reached to the floor and picked up the firemoss. He tossed it onto\nthe table and stared at it, then took a pull from his mug of wine. The next\nwrestling match started, and he winced as the two competitors collided.\nStorms. Why did he keep putting himself into situations like this?\n“Dalinar,” Havar said. “Any word yet on when we’re going to the Rift?”\n“The Rift?” Bashin asked. “What about it?”\n“Are you dense?” Havar said.\n“No,” Bashin said, “but I might be drunk. What’s up with the Rift?”\n“Rumor is they want to set up their own highprince,” Havar said. “Son\nof the old one, what was his name…”\n“Tanalan,” Dalinar said. “But we are not going to be visiting the Rift,\nHavar.”\n“Surely the king can’t—”\n“We won’t be going,” Dalinar said. “You’ve got men to train. And I…”\nDalinar drank more wine. “I’m going to be a father. My brother can handle\nthe Rift with diplomacy.”\nHavar leaned back, flippantly dropping his mug to the table. “The king\ncan’t politic his way past open rebellion, Dalinar.”\nDalinar closed his fist around the firemoss, but didn’t rub it. How much\nof his interest in the Rift was his duty to protect Gavilar’s kingdom, and\nhow much was his craving to feel the Thrill again?\nDamnation. He felt like half a man these days.\nOne of the wrestlers had shoved the other from the ring, disturbing the\nline of lights. The loser was declared, and a parshman carefully reset the\nring. As he did so, a master-servant stepped up to Dalinar’s table.\n“Pardon, Brightlord,” he whispered. “But you should know. The feature\nmatch will have to be canceled.”\n“What?” Bashin said. “What’s wrong? Makh isn’t going to fight?”\n“Pardon,” the master-servant repeated. “But his opponent has stomach\nproblems.

A tall, bald man stood at the side of the ring, bare-chested. He\nargued with several of the lighteyed organizers, pointing at the ring,\nangerspren boiling on the floor around him.\nTo Dalinar, this racket sounded like the calls of battle. He closed his eyes\nand breathed it in, finding a euphoria far superior to the firemoss. Storms.\nHe should have gotten drunker. He was going to slip.\nMight as well be quick about it then. He tossed aside the firemoss and\nstood, then pulled off his shirt.\n“Dalinar!” Havar said. “What are you doing?”\n“Gavilar says I need to have more concern for our people’s sorrows,”\nDalinar said, stepping up onto the table. “Seems like we’ve got a room full\nof sorrow here.”\nHavar gaped, jaw dropping.\n“Bet on me,” Dalinar said. “For old times’ sake.” He leaped off the table\non the other side, then shoved through the crowd. “Someone tell that man\nhe has a challenger!”\nSilence spread from him like a bad smell. Dalinar found himself at the\nedge of the ring in a completely quiet room, packed with once-rowdy men\nboth lighteyed and dark. The wrestler—Makh—stepped back, his dark\ngreen eyes wide, angerspren vanishing. He had a powerful build, arms that\nbulged like they were overstuffed. Word was, he’d never been defeated.\n“Well?” Dalinar said. “You wanted a fight and I need a workout.”\n“Brightlord,” the man said. “This was to be a freeform bout, all hits and\nholds allowed.”\n“Excellent,” Dalinar said. “What? You worried about injuring your\nhighprince? I promise you clemency for anything done to me.”\n“Hurting you?” the man said. “Storms, that’s not what I’m afraid of.” He\nshivered visibly, and a Thaylen woman—perhaps his manager—smacked\nhim on the arm. She thought he’d been rude. The wrestler only bowed and\nbacked away.\nDalinar turned about the room, confronted by a sea of faces that\nsuddenly seemed very uncomfortable. He’d broken some kind of rule here.\nThe gathering dissolved, parshmen retrieving spheres from the ground. It\nseemed Dalinar had been too hasty to judge rank unimportant here. They’d\nsuffered him as an observer, but he was not to participate.\nDamnation. He growled softly as he stalked to his bench, those\nangerspren following him on the floor. He took his shirt from Bashin with a\nswipe of the hand. Back with his elites, any man—from the lowest\nspearman to the highest captains—would have sparred or wrestled with\nhim. Storms, he’d faced the cook several times, much to the amusement of\neveryone involved.\nHe sat down and pulled on his shirt, stewing. He’d ripped the buttons\nfree in removing it so quickly. The room fell silent as people continued to\nleave, and Dalinar just sat there, tense—his body still expecting the fight\nthat would never come. No Thrill. Nothing to fill him."

No Thrill. Nothing to fill him.\nSoon, he and his friends were alone in the room, surveying empty tables,\nabandoned cups, and spilled drinks. The place somehow smelled even\nworse now than it had when crowded with men.\n“Probably for the best, Brightlord,” Havar said.\n“I want to be among soldiers again, Havar,” Dalinar whispered. “I want\nto be marching again. Best sleep a man can get is after a long march. And,\nDamnation, I want to fight. I want to face someone who won’t pull their\npunches because I’m a highprince.”\n“Then let’s find such a fight, Dalinar!” Havar said. “Surely the king will\nlet us go. If not to the Rift, then to Herdaz or one of the isles. We can bring\nhim land, glory, honor!”\n“That wrestler,” Dalinar said, “there was … something to his words. He\nwas certain I would hurt him.” Dalinar drummed his fingers on the table.\n“Was he scared off because of my reputation in general, or is there\nsomething more specific?”\nBashin and Havar shared a look.\n“When?” Dalinar asked.\n“Tavern fight,” Havar said. “Two weeks back? Do you remember it?”\nDalinar remembered a haze of monotony broken by light, a burst of\ncolor in his life. Emotion. He breathed out. “You told me everyone was\nfine.”\n“They lived,” Havar said.\n“One … of the brawlers you fought will never walk,” Bashin admitted.\n“Another had to have his arm removed. A third babbles like a child. His\nbrain doesn’t work anymore.”\n“That’s far from fine,” Dalinar snapped.\n“Pardon, Dalinar,” Havar said. “But when facing the Blackthorn, that’s\nas good as one can expect.”\nDalinar crossed his arms on the table, grinding his teeth. The firemoss\nwasn’t working. Yes, it gave him a quick rush of euphoria, but that only\nmade him want the greater headiness of the Thrill. Even now he felt on\nedge—he had the urge to smash this table and everything in the room. He’d\nbeen so ready for the fight; he’d surrendered to the temptation, and then had\nthe pleasure stolen from him.\nHe felt all the shame of losing control, but none of the satisfaction of\nactually getting to fight.\nDalinar seized his mug, but it was empty. Stormfather! He threw it and\nstood up, wanting to scream.\nHe was fortunately distracted by the back door to the wrestling den\ninching open, revealing a familiar pale face. Toh wore Alethi clothing now,\none of the new suits that Gavilar preferred, but it fit him poorly. He was too\nspindly. No man would ever mistake Toh—with that overcautious gait and\nwide-eyed innocence—for a soldier.\n“Dalinar?” he asked, looking over the spilled drinks and the locked\nsphere lamps on the walls. “The guards said I could find you here.

We need good role models to—”\nHe cut off as Dalinar raised his hand. He didn’t need underlings to cover\nfor him. “What is it, Toh?”\n“Oh!” the Riran man said. “They were going to send a messenger, but I\nwanted to deliver the news. My sister, you see. It’s a little early, but the\nmidwives aren’t surprised. They say it’s natural when—”\nDalinar gasped, like he’d been punched in the stomach. Early. Midwives.\nSister.\nHe charged for the door, and didn’t hear the rest of what Toh said.\n* * *\nEvi looked like she’d fought in a battle.\nHe’d seen that expression on the faces of soldiers many times: that\nsweaty brow, that half-dazed, drowsy look. Exhaustionspren, like jets in the\nair. These were the mark of a person pushed past the limits of what they\nthought they could do.\nShe bore a smile of quiet satisfaction. A look of victory. Dalinar pushed\npast doting surgeons and midwives, stepping up to Evi’s bed. She held out a\nlimp hand. Her left hand, which was wrapped only in a thin envelope that\nended at the wrist. It would have been a sign of intimacy, to an Alethi. But\nEvi still preferred that hand.\n“The baby?” he whispered, taking the hand.\n“A son. Healthy and strong.”\n“A son. I … I have a son?” Dalinar dropped to his knees beside the bed.\n“Where is he?”\n“Being washed, my lord,” said one of the midwives. “He will be\nreturned shortly.”\n“Torn buttons,” Evi whispered. “You’ve been fighting again, Dalinar?”\n“Just a small diversion.”\n“That’s what you say each time.”\nDalinar squeezed her hand through the envelope, too elated to prickle at\nthe chastisement. “You and Toh came here to Alethkar because you wanted\nsomeone to protect you. You sought out a fighter, Evi.”\nShe squeezed his hand back. A nurse approached with a bundle in her\narms and Dalinar looked up, stunned, unable to rise.\n“Now,” the woman said, “many men are apprehensive at first when—”\nShe cut off as Dalinar found his strength and seized the child from her\narms. He held the boy aloft in both hands, letting out a whooping laugh,\ngloryspren bursting around him as golden spheres.\n“My son!” he said.\n“My lord!” the nurse said. “Be careful!”"

He had shockingly thick hair, black and blond mixed.\nGood coloring. Distinctive.\nMay you have your father’s strength, Dalinar thought, rubbing the child’s\nface with his finger, and at least some of your mother’s compassion, little\none.\nLooking into that face, swelling with joy, Dalinar finally understood.\nThis was why Gavilar thought so much about the future, about Alethkar,\nabout crafting a kingdom that would last. Dalinar’s life so far had stained\nhim crimson and thrashed his soul. His heart was so crusted over with crem,\nit might as well have been a stone.\nBut this boy … he could rule the princedom, support his cousin the king,\nand live a life of honor.\n“His name, Brightlord?” asked Ishal, an aged ardent from the Devotary\nof Purity. “I would burn the proper glyphwards, if it pleases you.”\n“Name…” Dalinar said. “Adoda.” Light. He glanced toward Evi, who\nnodded in agreement.\n“Without a suffix, my lord? Adodan? Adodal?”\n“Lin,” Dalinar whispered. Born unto. “Adolin.” A good name,\ntraditional, full of meaning.\nWith regret, Dalinar surrendered the child to the nurses, who returned\nhim to his mother, explaining that it was important to train the baby to\nsuckle as soon as possible. Most in the room began to file out to offer\nprivacy, and as they did, Dalinar caught sight of a regal figure standing at\nthe back. How had he missed Gavilar there?\nGavilar took him by the arm and gave him a good thump on the back as\nthey left the chamber. Dalinar was so dazed he barely felt it. He needed to\ncelebrate—buy drinks for every man in the army, declare a holiday, or just\nrun through the city whooping for joy. He was a father!\n“An excellent day,” Gavilar said. “A most excellent day.”\n“How do you contain it?” Dalinar said. “This excitement?”\nGavilar grinned. “I let the emotion be my reward for the work I have\ndone.”\nDalinar nodded, then studied his brother. “What?” Dalinar said.\n“Something is wrong.”\n“Nothing.”\n“Don’t lie to me, Brother.”\n“I don’t want to ruin your wonderful day.”\n“Wondering will ruin it more than anything you could say, Gavilar. Out\nwith it.”\nThe king mulled, then nodded toward Dalinar’s den. They crossed the\nmain chamber, passing furniture that was far too showy—colorful, with\nfloral patterns and plush cushions. Evi’s taste was partially to blame, though\nit was also just … life, these days. His life was plush.\nThe den was more to his liking. A few chairs, a hearth, a simple rug.

It’s not that.” Gavilar frowned, his\nexpression dangerous. He’d agreed to a crown after much debate—\nSunmaker hadn’t worn one, and the histories said Jezerezeh’Elin refused\nthem as well. But people did love symbols, and most Western kings wore\ncrowns. Gavilar had settled upon a black iron circlet. The more Gavilar’s\nhair greyed, the easier the crown was to see.\nA servant had set a fire in the hearth, though it was burning low, only a\nsingle flamespren crawling along the embers.\n“I am failing,” Gavilar said.\n“What?”\n“Rathalas. The Rift.”\n“But I thought—”\n“Propaganda,” Gavilar said. “Intended to quiet critical voices in\nKholinar. Tanalan is raising an army and settling into his fortifications.\nWorse, I think the other highprinces are encouraging him. They want to see\nhow I handle this.” He sneered. “There’s talk I’ve grown soft over the\nyears.”\n“They’re wrong.” Dalinar had seen it, these months living with Gavilar.\nHis brother had not grown soft. He was still as eager for conquest as ever;\nhe simply approached it differently. The clash of words, the maneuvering of\nprincedoms into positions where they were forced to obey.\nThe fire’s embers seemed to pulse like a heartbeat. “Do you ever wonder\nabout the time when this kingdom was truly great, Dalinar?” Gavilar asked.\n“When people looked to the Alethi. When kings sought their advice. When\nwe were … Radiant.”\n“Traitors,” Dalinar said.\n“Does the act of a single generation negate many generations of\ndomination? We revere the Sunmaker when his reign lasted but the blink of\nan eye—yet we ignore the centuries the Radiants led. How many\nDesolations did they defend mankind?”\n“Um…” The ardents talked about this in prayers, didn’t they? He tried a\nguess. “Ten?”\n“A meaningless number,” Gavilar said, waving his fingers. “The histories\njust say ‘ten’ because it sounds significant. Either way, I have failed in my\ndiplomatic efforts.” He turned toward Dalinar. “It is time to show the\nkingdom that we are not soft, Brother.”\nOh no. Hours ago, he would have leaped in excitement. But after seeing\nthat child …\nYou’ll be anxious again in a few days, Dalinar told himself. A man can’t\nchange in a moment.\n“Gavilar,” he whispered, “I’m worried.”\n“You’re still the Blackthorn, Dalinar.”\n“I’m not worried about whether I can win battles.” Dalinar stood,\nthrowing back his chair in his haste. He found himself pacing. “I’m like an\nanimal, Gavilar. Did you hear about the bar fight? Storms. I can’t be trusted\naround people.”\n“You are what the Almighty made you.”"

He would never\nreturn to that place that had almost led him to attack this man.\n“When do I ride for the Rift?” Dalinar asked.\n“You don’t.”\n“But you just said—”\n“I’m sending you to battle, but not against the Rift. Our kingdom suffers\nthreats from abroad. There is a new dynasty threatening us from Herdaz; a\nReshi house has gained power there. And the Vedens have been raiding\nAlethkar in the southwest. They’re claiming it’s bandits, but the forces are\ntoo organized. It’s a test to see how we react.”\nDalinar nodded slowly. “You want me to go fight on our borders.\nRemind everyone we’re still capable of employing the sword.”\n“Exactly. This is a dangerous time for us, Brother. The highprinces\nquestion. Is a united Alethkar worth the trouble? Why bow before a king?\nTanalan is the manifestation of their questions, but he has been careful not\nto stray into outright rebellion. If you attack him, the other highprinces\ncould unite behind the rebels. We could shatter the kingdom and have to\nstart all over.\n“I will not allow that. I will have a unified Alethkar. Even if I have to hit\nthe highprinces so hard, they are forced to melt together from the heat of it.\nThey need to remember that. Go to Herdaz first, then Jah Keved. Remind\neveryone why they fear you.”\nGavilar met Dalinar’s eyes. No … he was not soft. He thought like a\nking now. He sought the long term, but Gavilar Kholin was as determined\nas ever.\n“It will be done,” Dalinar said. Storms, this day had been a tempest of\nemotion. Dalinar stalked toward the door. He wanted to see the child again.\n“Brother?” Gavilar said.\nDalinar turned back and regarded Gavilar, who was bathed by the\nbleeding light of a fire reaching its end.\n“Words are important,” Gavilar said. “Much more than you give them\ncredit for being.”\n“Perhaps,” Dalinar said. “But if they were all-powerful, you wouldn’t\nneed my sword, would you?”\n“Perhaps.

On one hand, the view over the Shattered Plains was\nmagnificent. He felt he could almost see the pattern to it that Shallan\nmentioned.\nOn the other hand, this kind of travel was deeply unnatural. Winds\nbuffeted them, and if you moved your hands or arched your back in the\nwrong way, you were sent in a different direction from everyone else.\nKaladin had to constantly zip back and forth, righting one of them that got\nblown off-course. And if you looked down, and paused to consider exactly\nhow high up you were …\nWell, Dalinar was not a timid man, but he was still glad of Navani’s hand\nin his.\nOn his other side flew Elhokar, and beyond him were Kadash and a\npretty young ardent who served as one of Navani’s scholars. The five of\nthem were escorted by Kaladin and ten of his squires. The Windrunners had\nbeen training steadily for three weeks now, and Kaladin had finally—after\npracticing by flying groups of soldiers back and forth to the warcamps—\nagreed to treat Dalinar and the king to a similar trip.\nIt is like being on a ship, Dalinar thought. What would it feel like to be\nup here during a highstorm? That was how Kaladin planned to get\nElhokar’s team to Kholinar—fly them at the leading edge of a storm, so his\nStormlight was continually renewed.\nYou’re thinking of me, the Stormfather sent. I can feel it.\n“I’m thinking of how you treat ships,” Dalinar whispered, his physical\nvoice lost to the winds—yet his meaning carried, unhampered, to the\nStormfather.\nMen should not be upon the waters during a storm, he replied. Men are\nnot of the waves.\n“And the sky? Are men of the sky?”\nSome are. He said this grudgingly.\nDalinar could only imagine how terrible it must be to be a sailor out at\nsea during a storm. He had taken only short coastwise trips by ship.\nNo, wait, he thought. There was one, of course. A trip to the Valley …\nHe barely remembered that voyage, though he could not blame that\nsolely upon the Nightwatcher.\nCaptain Kaladin swooped over. He was the only one who seemed truly\nin control of his flying. Even his men flew more like dropped rocks than\nskyeels. They lacked his finesse, his control. Though the others could help\nif something went wrong, Kaladin had been the only one Lashing Dalinar"

He said he wanted practice, for the eventual flight to\nKholinar.\nKaladin touched Elhokar, and the king started to slow. Kaladin then\nmoved down the line, slowing each in turn. He then swept them up so they\nwere close enough to speak. His soldiers stopped and floated nearby.\n“What’s wrong?” Dalinar asked, trying to ignore that he was hanging\nhundreds of feet in the sky.\n“Nothing’s wrong,” Kaladin said, then pointed.\nWith the wind in his eyes, Dalinar had failed to spot the warcamps: ten\ncraterlike circles arrayed along the northwestern edge of the Shattered\nPlains. From up here, it was obvious they had once been domes. The way\ntheir walls curved, like cupping fingers from underneath.\nTwo of the camps were still fully occupied, and Sebarial had set up\nforces to lay claim to the nearby forest. Dalinar’s own warcamp was less\npopulated, but had a few platoons of soldiers and some workers.\n“We arrived so quickly!” Navani said. Her hair was a wind-tousled mess,\nmuch of it having escaped her careful braid. Elhokar hadn’t fared much\nbetter—his hair sprayed out from his face like waxed Thaylen eyebrows.\nThe two ardents, of course, were bald and didn’t have such worries.\n“Quick indeed,” Elhokar said, redoing a few buttons of his uniform.\n“This is most promising for our mission.”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said. “I still want to test it more in front of a storm.” He\ntook the king by the shoulder, and Elhokar started to drift downward.\nKaladin sent them each down in turn, and when his feet finally touched\nstone again, Dalinar heaved a sigh of relief. They were only one plateau\nover from the warcamp, where a soldier at a watchpost waved to them with\neager, exaggerated movements. Within minutes, a troop of Kholin soldiers\nhad surrounded them.\n“Let’s get you inside the walls, Brightlord,” their captainlord said, hand\non the pommel of his sword. “The shellheads are still active out here.”\n“Have they attacked this close to the camps?” Elhokar asked, surprised.\n“No, but that doesn’t mean they won’t, Your Majesty.”\nDalinar wasn’t so worried, but said nothing as the soldiers ushered him\nand the others into the warcamp where Brightness Jasalai—the tall, stately\nwoman Dalinar had put in charge of the camp—met and accompanied them.\nAfter spending so much time in the alien hallways of Urithiru, walking\nthrough this place—which had been Dalinar’s home for five years—was\nrelaxing. Part of that was finding the warcamp mostly intact; it had\nweathered the Everstorm quite well. Most of the buildings were stone\nbunkers, and that western rim of the former dome had provided a solid\nwindbreak.\n“My only worry,” he told Jasalai after a short tour, “is about logistics.\nThis is a long march from Narak and the Oathgate.

I fear that by dividing\nour forces among Narak, here, and Urithiru, we’re increasing our\nvulnerability to an attack.”\n“That is true, Brightlord,” the woman said. “I endeavor only to provide\nyou with options.”\nUnfortunately, they would probably need this place for farming\noperations, not to mention the lumber. Plateau runs for gemhearts couldn’t\nsustain the tower city’s population forever, particularly in the face of\nShallan’s assessment that they had likely hunted chasmfiends near to\nextinction.\nDalinar glanced at Navani. She thought they should found a new\nkingdom here, on and around the Shattered Plains. Import farmers, retire\nolder soldiers, start production here on a much larger scale than they’d ever\ntried before.\nOthers disagreed. There was a reason the Unclaimed Hills weren’t\ndensely inhabited. It would be a harsh life here—rockbuds grew smaller,\ncrops would be less productive. And founding a new kingdom during a\nDesolation? Better to protect what they had. Alethkar could probably feed\nUrithiru—but that depended on Kaladin and Elhokar recovering the capital.\nTheir tour ended with a meal at Dalinar’s bunker, in his former sitting\nroom, which looked bare now that most of the furniture and rugs had been\nremoved to Urithiru.\nAfter the meal, he found himself standing by the window, feeling oddly\nout of place. He’d left this warcamp only ten weeks ago, but the place was\nat once deeply familiar and also no longer his.\nBehind him, Navani and her scribe ate fruit as they chatted quietly over\nsome sketches that Navani had done.\n“Oh, but I think that the others need to experience that, Brightness!” the\nscribe said. “The flight was remarkable. How fast do you think we were\ngoing? I believe we might have attained a speed that no human has reached\nsince the Recreance. Think about that, Navani! Surely we were faster than\nthe fastest horse or ship.”\n“Focus, Rushu,” Navani said. “My sketch.”\n“I don’t think this math is right, Brightness. No, that sail will never\nstand.”\n“It’s not meant to be completely accurate,” Navani said. “Just a concept.\nMy question is, can it work?”\n“We’ll need more reinforcement. Yes, more reinforcement for certain.\nAnd then the steering mechanism … definitely work to do there. This is\nclever though, Brightness. Falilar needs to see it; he will be able to say\nwhether or not it can be built.”\nDalinar glanced away from the window, catching Navani’s eye. She\nsmiled. She always claimed that she wasn’t a scholar, but a patron of\nscholars. She said her place was to encourage and guide the real scientists.\nAnyone who saw the light in her eyes as she took out another sheet and\nsketched her idea further knew she was being too modest.\nShe began another sketch, but then stopped and glanced to the side,\nwhere she’d set out a spanreed.

The queen of Thaylenah had asked that, in this\nmorning’s highstorm, Dalinar send her into the vision of Aharietiam, which\nshe knew about from the published accounts of Dalinar’s visions. He’d\nreluctantly sent her alone, without supervision.\nThey’d been waiting for her to speak of the event, to say anything. In the\nmorning, she hadn’t replied to their requests for a conversation.\nNavani prepared the spanreed, then set it writing. It scribbled for only a\nbrief moment.\n“That was short,” Dalinar said, stepping toward her.\n“Only one word,” Navani said. She looked up at him. “Yes.”\nDalinar heaved out a long breath. She was willing to visit Urithiru.\nFinally!\n“Tell her we’ll send her a Radiant.” He left the window, watching as she\nreplied. In her sketchpad, he caught sight of some kind of shiplike\ncontraption, but with the sail on the bottom. What in the world?\nFen seemed content to leave the conversation there, and Navani returned\nto her discussion of engineering, so Dalinar slipped from the room. He\npassed through his bunker, which felt hollow. Like the rind of a fruit with\nthe pulp scooped out. No servants scuttling back and forth, no soldiers.\nKaladin and his men had gone off somewhere, and Kadash was probably at\nthe camp monastery. He’d been keen to get there, and Dalinar had been\ngratified by his willingness to fly with Kaladin.\nThey hadn’t spoken much since their confrontation in the sparring room.\nWell, perhaps seeing the Windrunners’ power firsthand would improve\nKadash’s opinion of the Radiants.\nDalinar was surprised—and secretly pleased—to find that no guards had\nbeen posted at the bunker’s back door. He slipped out alone and headed to\nthe warcamp monastery. He wasn’t looking for Kadash; he had another\npurpose.\nHe soon arrived at the monastery, which looked like most of the\nwarcamp—a collection of buildings with the same smooth, rounded\nconstruction. Crafted from the air by Alethi Soulcasters. This place had a\nfew small, hand-built buildings of cut stone, but they looked more like\nbunkers than places of worship. Dalinar had never wanted his people to\nforget that they were at war.\nHe strolled through the campus and found that without a guide, he didn’t\nknow his way among the nearly identical structures. He stopped in a\ncourtyard between buildings. The air smelled of wet stone from the\nhighstorm, and a nice group of shalebark sculptures rose to his right, shaped\nlike stacks of square plates. The only sound was water dripping from the\neaves of the buildings.\nStorms. He should know his way around his own monastery, shouldn’t\nhe? How often did you actually visit here, during all the years in the\nwarcamps? He’d meant to come more often, and talk to the ardents in his\nchosen devotary. There had always been something more pressing, and\nbesides, the ardents stressed that he didn’t need to come. They had prayed\nand burned glyphwards on his behalf; that was why highlords owned\nardents."

They had prayed\nand burned glyphwards on his behalf; that was why highlords owned\nardents.\nEven during his darkest days of war, they’d assured him that in pursuing\nhis Calling—by leading his armies—he served the Almighty.\nDalinar stooped into a building that had been divided into many small\nrooms for prayers. He walked down a hallway until he stepped through a\nstorm door into the atrium, which still smelled faintly of incense. It seemed\ninsane that the ardents would be angry with him now, after training him his\nwhole life to do as he wished. But he’d upset the balance. Rocked the boat.\nHe moved among braziers filled with wet ash. Everyone liked the system\nthey had. The lighteyes got to live without guilt or burden, always confident\nthat they were active manifestations of God’s will. The darkeyes got free\naccess to training in a multitude of skills. The ardents got to pursue\nscholarship. The best of them lived lives of service. The worst lived lives of\nindolence—but what else were important lighteyed families going to do\nwith unmotivated children?\nA noise drew his attention, and he left the courtyard and looked into a\ndark corridor. Light poured from a room at the other end, and Dalinar was\nnot surprised to find Kadash inside. The ardent was moving some ledgers\nand books from a wall safe into a pack on the floor. On a desk nearby, a\nspanreed scribbled.\nDalinar stepped into the room. The scarred ardent jumped, then relaxed\nwhen he saw it was Dalinar.\n“Do we need to have this conversation again, Dalinar?” he asked, turning\nback to his packing.\n“No,” Dalinar said. “I didn’t actually come looking for you. I want to\nfind a man who lived here. A madman who claimed to be one of the\nHeralds.”\nKadash cocked his head. “Ah, yes. The one who had a Shardblade?”\n“All of the other patients at the monastery are accounted for, safe at\nUrithiru, but he vanished somehow. I was hoping to see if his room offered\nany clues to what became of him.”\nKadash looked at him, gauging his sincerity. Then the ardent sighed,\nrising. “That’s a different devotary from mine,” he said, “but I have\noccupancy records here. I should be able to tell you which room he was in.”\n“Thank you.”\nKadash looked through a stack of ledgers. “Shash building,” he finally\nsaid, pointing absently out the window. “That one right there. Room thirty-\nseven. Insah ran the facility; her records will list details of the madman’s\ntreatment. If her departure from the warcamp was anything like mine, she’ll\nhave left most of her paperwork behind.” He gestured toward the safe and\nhis packing.\n“Thank you,” Dalinar said. He moved to leave.\n“You … think the madman was actually a Herald, don’t you?”\n“I think it’s likely.”\n“He spoke with a rural Alethi accent, Dalinar.”\n“And he looked Makabaki,” Dalinar replied. “That alone is an oddity,\nwouldn’t you say?”\n“Immigrant families are not so uncommon.”"

Would you\nbelieve him if he told you the same things I have?”\nKadash sighed.\n“Surely you’d want to know if the Almighty were dead, Kadash,”\nDalinar said, stepping back into the room. “Tell me you wouldn’t.”\n“You know what it would mean? It would mean there is no spiritual\nbasis for your rule.”\n“I know.”\n“And the things you did in conquering Alethkar?” Kadash said. “No\ndivine mandate, Dalinar. Everyone accepts what you did because your\nvictories were proof of the Almighty’s favor. Without him … then what are\nyou?”\n“Tell me, Kadash. Would you really rather not know?”\nKadash looked at the spanreed, which had stopped writing. He shook his\nhead. “I don’t know, Dalinar. It certainly would be easier.”\n“Isn’t that the problem? What has any of this ever required of men like\nme? What has it required of any of us?”\n“It required you to be what you are.”\n“Which is self-fulfilling,” Dalinar said. “You were a swordsman,\nKadash. Would you have gotten better without opponents to face? Would\nyou have gotten stronger without weights to lift? Well, in Vorinism, we’ve\nspent centuries avoiding the opponents and the weights.”\nAgain, Kadash glanced at the spanreed.\n“What is it?” Dalinar asked.\n“I left most of my spanreeds behind,” Kadash explained, “when I went\nwith you toward the center of the Shattered Plains. I took only the spanreed\nlinked to an ardent transfer station in Kholinar. I thought that would be\nenough, but it no longer works. I’ve been forced to use intermediaries in\nTashikk.”\nKadash lifted a box onto the desk and opened it. Inside were five more\nspanreeds, with blinking rubies, indicating that someone had been trying to\ncontact Kadash.\n“These are links to the leaders of Vorinism in Jah Keved, Herdaz,\nKharbranth, Thaylenah, and New Natanan,” Kadash said, counting them\noff. “They had a meeting via reeds today, discussing the nature of the\nDesolation and the Everstorm. And perhaps you. I mentioned I was going to\nrecover my own spanreeds today. Apparently, their meeting has made them\nall very eager to question me further.”\nHe let the silence hang between them, measured out by the five blinking\nred lights.\n“What of the one that is writing?” Dalinar asked.\n“A line to the Palanaeum and the heads of Vorin research there. They’ve\nbeen working on the Dawnchant, using the clues Brightness Navani gave\nthem from your visions. What they’ve sent me are relevant passages from\nongoing translations.”\n“Proof,” Dalinar said. “You wanted solid proof that what I’ve been"

These days, it’s more a\nquestion of who might be influencing you.”\n“Why would the Voidbringers give me these visions?” Dalinar said.\n“Why would they grant us great powers, like the one that flew us here? It’s\nnot rational, Kadash.”\n“Neither is what you’re saying about the Almighty.” He held up a hand\nto cut off Dalinar. “I don’t want to have this argument again. Before, you\nasked me for proof that we are following the Almighty’s precepts, right?”\n“All I asked for and all I want is the truth.”\n“We have it already. I’ll show you.”\n“I look forward to it,” Dalinar said, walking to the door. “But Kadash? In\nmy painful experience, the truth may be simple, but it is rarely easy.”\nDalinar crossed to the next building over and counted down the rooms.\nStorms, this building felt like a prison. Most of the doors hung open,\nrevealing uniform chambers beyond: each had one tiny window, a slab for a\nbed, and a thick wooden door. The ardents knew what was best for the sick\n—they had access to all the world’s latest research in all fields—but was it\nreally necessary to lock madmen away like this?\nNumber thirty-seven was still bolted shut. Dalinar rattled the door, then\nthrew his shoulder against it. Storms, it was thick. Without thinking he put\nhis hand to the side and tried summoning his Shardblade. Nothing\nhappened.\nWhat are you doing? the Stormfather demanded.\n“Sorry,” Dalinar said, shaking his hand out. “Habit.”\nHe crouched down and tried peeking under the door, then called out,\nsuddenly horrified by the idea that they might have simply left the man in\nhere to starve. That couldn’t have happened, could it?\n“My powers,” Dalinar said, rising. “Can I use them?”\nBinding things? the Stormfather said. How would that open a door? You\nare a Bondsmith; you bring things together, you do not divide them.\n“And my other Surge?” Dalinar said. “That Radiant in the vision made\nstone warp and ripple.”\nYou are not ready. Besides, that Surge is different for you than it is for a\nStoneward.\nWell, from what Dalinar could see underneath the door, there seemed to\nbe light in this room. Perhaps it had a window to the outside he could use.\nOn his way out, he poked through the ardent chambers until he found an\noffice like Kadash’s. He didn’t find any keys, though the desk still had pens\nand ink sitting on it. They’d left in haste, so there was a good chance the\nwall safe contained records—but of course, Dalinar couldn’t get in.

Somebody else had already cut a hole in the stone out here, using the\ndistinctive, clean slices of a Shardblade.\nDalinar stepped inside, picking his way around the broken remnants of\nthe wall, which had fallen inward—indicating that the Shardbearer had cut\nfrom the outside. He found no madman. The ardents had likely seen this\nhole and moved on with their evacuation. News of the strange hole must not\nhave filtered up to the lead ardents.\nHe didn’t find anything to indicate where the Herald had gone, but at\nleast he knew a Shardbearer was involved. Someone powerful had wanted\ninto this room, which lent even more credence to the madman’s claims of\nbeing a Herald.\nSo who had taken him? Or had they done something to him instead?\nWhat happened to a Herald’s body when they died? Could someone else\nhave come to the same conclusion that Jasnah had?\nAs he was about to leave, Dalinar spotted something on the ground\nbeside the bed. He knelt down, shooed away a cremling, and picked up a\nsmall object. It was a dart, green with yellow twine wrapped around it. He\nfrowned, turning it over in his fingers. Then he looked up as he heard\nsomeone distantly calling his name.\nHe found Kaladin out in the monastery courtyard, calling for him.\nDalinar approached, then handed him the little dart. “Ever seen anything\nlike this before, Captain?”\nKaladin shook his head. He sniffed at the tip, then raised his eyebrows.\n“That’s poison on the tip. Blackbane derived.”\n“Are you sure?” Dalinar asked, taking the dart back.\n“Very. Where did you find it?”\n“In the chamber that housed the Herald.”\nKaladin grunted. “You need more time for your search?”\n“Not much,” Dalinar said. “Though it would help if you’d summon your\nShardblade.…”\nA short time later, Dalinar handed Navani the records he’d taken from\nthe ardent’s safe. He dropped the dart in a pouch and handed it over as well,\nwarning her about the poisoned tip.\nOne by one, Kaladin sent them into the sky, where his bridgemen caught\nthem and used Stormlight to stabilize them. Dalinar was last, and as Kaladin\nreached for him, he took the captain by the arm.\n“You want to practice flying in front of a storm,” Dalinar said. “Could\nyou get to Thaylenah?”\n“Probably,” Kaladin said. “If I Lashed myself southward as fast as I can\ngo.”\n“Go, then,” Dalinar said. “Take someone with you to test flying another\nperson in front of a storm, if you want, but get to Thaylen City. Queen Fen\nis willing to join us, and I want that Oathgate active. The world has been\nturning before our very noses, Captain.

If you wish more, seek these waters\nin person and overcome the tests we have created.\nOnly in this will you earn our respect.\nThe parshmen of Moash’s new sledge crew didn’t like him. That didn’t\nbother him. Lately, he didn’t much like himself.\nHe didn’t expect or need their admiration. He knew what it felt like to be\nbeaten down, despised. When you’d been treated as they had, you didn’t\ntrust someone like Moash. You asked yourself what he was trying to get\nfrom you.\nAfter a few days of pulling their sledge, the landscape began to change.\nThe open plains became cultivated hills. They passed great sweeping wards\n—artificial stone ridges built by planting sturdy wooden barricades to\ncollect crem during storms. The crem would harden, slowly building up a\nmound on the stormward side. After a few years, you raised the top of the\nbarricade.\nThey took generations to grow to useful sizes, but here—around the\noldest, most populated centers of Alethkar—they were common. They\nlooked like frozen waves of stone, stiff and straight on the western side,\nsloping and smooth on the other side. In their shadows, vast orchards spread\nin rows, most of the trees cultivated to grow no more than the height of a\nman.\nThe western edge of those orchards was ragged with broken trees.\nBarriers would need to be erected to the west as well, now.\nHe expected the Fused to burn the orchards, but they didn’t. During a\nwater break, Moash studied one of them—a tall woman who hovered a\ndozen feet in the air, toes pointed downward. Her face was more angular\nthan those of the parshmen. She resembled a spren the way she hung there,\nan impression accented by her flowing clothing.\nMoash leaned back against his sledge and took a pull on his waterskin.\nNearby, an overseer watched him and the parshmen of his crew. She was\nnew; a replacement for the one he’d punched. A few more of the Fused\npassed on horses, trotting the beasts with obvious familiarity.\nThat variety doesn’t fly, he thought. They can raise the dark light around\nthemselves, but it doesn’t give them Lashings. Something else. He glanced\nback at the one nearest him, the one hovering. But that type almost never\nwalks. It’s the same kind that captured me.\nKaladin wouldn’t have been able to stay aloft as long as these did. He’d\nrun out of Stormlight.\nShe’s studying those orchards, Moash thought. She looks impressed.\nShe turned in the air and soared off, long clothing rippling behind her.\nThose overlong robes would have been impractical for anyone else, but for\na creature who almost always flew, the effect was mesmerizing.\n“This isn’t what it was supposed to be like,” Moash said.\nNearby, one of the parshmen of his crew grunted. “Tell me about it,\nhuman.”"

The parshman was tall, with rough hands, mostly dark\nskin marbled with lines of red.

Everything he knew about history and religion, he’d have heard\nfiltered through the human perspective.\n“You shouldn’t speak so casually about the Fused, human,” Sah said,\nstanding up. “They’re dangerous.”\n“Don’t know about that,” Moash said as two more passed overhead.\n“The one I killed went down easy enough, though I don’t think she was\nexpecting me to be able to fight back.”\nHe handed his waterskin to the overseer as she came around for them;\nthen he glanced at Sah, who was staring at him, slack-jawed.\nProbably shouldn’t have mentioned killing one of their gods, Moash\nthought, walking to his place in line—last, closest to the sledge, so he stared\nat a sweaty parshman back all day.\nThey started up again, and Moash expected another long day’s work.\nThese orchards meant Kholinar itself was a little over a day’s hike away at\nan easy pace. He figured the Voidbringers would push them hard to reach\nthe capital by nightfall.\nHe was surprised, then, when the army diverged from the direct route.\nThey wove between some hillsides until they reached a town, one of the\nmany suburbs of Kholinar. He couldn’t recall the name. The tavern had\nbeen nice, and welcoming to caravaneers.\nClearly there were other Voidbringer armies moving through Alethkar,\nbecause they’d obviously seized this city days—if not weeks—ago.\nParshmen patrolled it, and the only humans he saw were already working\nthe fields.\nOnce the army arrived, the Voidbringers surprised Moash again by\nselecting some of the wagon-pullers and setting them free. They were the\nweaklings, the ones who had fared worst on the road. The overseers sent\nthem trudging toward Kholinar, which was still too far off to see.\nThey’re trying to burden the city with refugees, Moash thought. Ones\nthat aren’t fit to work or fight anymore.\nThe main bulk of the army moved into the large storm bunkers in this\nsuburb. They wouldn’t attack the city immediately. The Voidbringers would"

The Voidbringers would\nrest their armies, prepare, and besiege.\nIn his youth, he’d wondered why there weren’t any suburbs closer than a\nday’s walk from Kholinar. In fact, there was nothing between its walls and\nhere, only empty flats—even the hills there had been mined down centuries\nago. The purpose was clear to him now. If you wanted to lay siege to\nKholinar, this was the closest you could put your army. You couldn’t camp\nin the city’s shadow; you’d be swept away by the first storm.\nIn the town, the supply sledges were split, some sent down one street—\nwhich looked hauntingly empty to him—while his went down another.\nThey actually passed the tavern he’d preferred, the Fallen Tower; he could\nsee the glyph etched into the leeward stone.\nFinally his crew was called to a halt, and he let go of the rope, stretching\nhis hands and letting out a relieved sigh. They’d been sent to a large open\nground near some warehouses, where parshmen were cutting lumber.\nA lumberyard? he thought, then felt stupid. After hauling wood all this\nway, what else would he expect?\nStill … a lumberyard. Like those back in the warcamps. He started\nlaughing.\n“Don’t be so jovial, human,” spat one of the overseers. “You’re to spend\nthe next few weeks working here, building siege equipment. When the\nassault happens, you’ll be at the front, running a ladder toward Kholinar’s\ninfamous walls.”\nMoash laughed even harder. It consumed him, shook him; he couldn’t\nstop. He laughed helplessly until, short of breath, he dizzily lay back on the\nhard stone ground, tears leaking down the sides of his face.\n* * *\nWe have investigated this woman, Mraize’s newest letter to Shallan read.\nIshnah has overinflated her importance to you. She was indeed involved in espionage\nfor House Hamaradin, as she told you, but she was merely an assistant to the true\nspies.\nWe have determined that she is safe to allow close to you, though her loyalties\nshould not be trusted too far. If you eliminate her, we will help cover up the\ndisappearance, at your request. But we have no objection to you retaining her services.\nShallan sighed, settling back in her seat, where she waited outside King\nElhokar’s audience chamber. She’d found this paper unexpectedly in her\nsatchel.\nSo much for hoping Ishnah had information about the Ghostbloods she\ncould use. The letter practically boiled with possessiveness. They would\n“allow” Ishnah to be close to her? Storms, they acted like they owned her\nalready.\nShe shook her head, then rummaged in her satchel, taking out a small\nsphere pouch. It would look unremarkable to anyone inspecting it—for they\nwouldn’t know that she’d transformed it with a small but simple illusion.\nThough it appeared violet, it was actually white.\nThe interesting thing about it was not the illusion itself, but how she was\npowering it.

She’d practiced before with attaching an illusion to Pattern, or\nto a location, but she’d always needed to power it with her own Stormlight.\nThis one, however, she’d attached to a sphere inside the pouch.\nShe was going on four hours now with the Lightweaving needing no\nextra Stormlight from her. She’d needed only to create it, then affix it to the\nsphere. Slowly, the Light had been draining from the sapphire mark—just\nlike a fabrial draining its gemstone. She’d even left the pouch alone in her\nrooms when going out, and the illusion had still been in place when she’d\nreturned.\nThis had begun as an experiment on how she could help Dalinar create\nhis illusory maps of the world, then leave them for him, without her having\nto remain in the meeting. Now, however, she was seeing all kinds of\npossible applications.\nThe door opened, and she dropped the pouch back into her satchel. A\nmaster-servant ushered a few merchants out of the king’s presence; then the\nservant bowed to Shallan, waving her in. She stepped hesitantly into the\naudience chamber: a room with a fine blue and green rug and stuffed with\nfurniture. Diamonds shone from lamps, and Elhokar had ordered the walls\npainted, obscuring the strata.\nThe king himself, in a blue Kholin uniform, was unrolling a map onto a\nlarge table at the side of the room. “Was there another, Helt?” he asked the\nmaster-servant. “I thought I was done for the…” He trailed off as he turned.\n“Brightness Shallan! Were you waiting out there? You could have seen me\nimmediately!”\n“I didn’t want to be a bother,” Shallan said, stepping over to him as the\nmaster-servant prepared refreshment.\nThe map on the table showed Kholinar, a grand city, which seemed every\nbit as impressive as Vedenar. Papers in a pile beside it looked to have the\nfinal reports from spanreeds in the city, and a wizened ardent sat near them,\nready to read for the king or take notes at his request.\n“I think we’re almost ready,” the king said, noting her interest. “The\ndelay has been nearly insufferable, but requisite, I’m sure. Captain Kaladin\ndid want to practice flying other people before bringing my royal person. I\ncan respect that.”\n“He’s asked me to fly with him above the storm to Thaylen City,”\nShallan said, “to open the Oathgate there. He’s overly worried about\ndropping people—but if he does that to me, I’ll have Stormlight of my own,\nand should survive the fall.”\n“Excellent,” Elhokar said. “Yes, a fine solution. But then, you didn’t\ncome here to talk about this. What is your request of me?”\n“Actually,” Shallan said. “Could I talk to you in private for a moment,\nYour Majesty?”\nHe frowned, but then ordered his people to step out into the hallway.\nWhen two guards from Bridge Thirteen hesitated, the king was firm. “She’s"

Shallan\ntook a deep breath.\nThen changed her face.\nNot to that of Veil or Radiant—not one of her secrets—but instead to an\nillusion of Adolin. It was still surprisingly uncomfortable for her to do it in\nfront of someone. She’d still been telling most people that she was of the\nElsecallers, like Jasnah, so they wouldn’t know of her ability to become\nother people.\nElhokar jumped. “Ah,” he said. “Ah, that’s right.”\n“Your Majesty,” Shallan said, changing her face and body to look like\nthat of a cleaning woman she’d sketched earlier, “I’m worried that your\nmission will not be as simple as you think.”\nThe letters out of Kholinar—the last ones they’d gotten—were\nfrightened, worried things. They spoke of riots, of darkness, of spren taking\nform and hurting people.\nShallan changed her face to that of a soldier. “I’ve been preparing a team\nof spies,” she explained. “Specializing in infiltration and information\ngathering. I’ve been keeping my focus quiet, for obvious reasons. I would\nlike to offer my services for your mission.”\n“I’m not certain,” Elhokar said, hesitantly, “if Dalinar would want me\ntaking two of his Radiants away from him.”\n“I’m not accomplishing much for him sitting around here,” Shallan said,\nstill wearing the soldier’s face. “Besides. Is it his mission? Or is it yours?”\n“My mission,” the king said. Then hesitated. “But let’s not fool\nourselves. If he didn’t want you to go…”\n“I am not his subject,” she said. “Nor yours, yet. I’m my own woman.\nYou tell me. What happens if you get to Kholinar, and the Oathgate is held\nby the enemy? Are you going to let the bridgeman just fight his way in? Or\nmight there be a better option?”\nShe changed her face to that of a parshwoman she had from her older\nsketches.\nElhokar nodded, walking around her. “A team, you say. Of spies?\nInteresting…”\n* * *\nA short time later, Shallan left the room carrying—tucked into her\nsafepouch—a formal royal request to Dalinar for Shallan’s aid on the\nmission. Kaladin had said he felt comfortable bringing six people, other\nthan a few bridgemen, who could fly on their own.\nAdolin and Elhokar would leave room for four others. She tucked\nElhokar’s request into her safepouch, beside the letter from Mraize.\nI just need to be away from this place, Shallan thought. I need to be away\nfrom them, and from Jasnah, at least until I can figure out what I want.\nA part of her knew what she was doing.

Instead she was fleeing.\nBut she could help the group going to Kholinar. And it did feel exciting,\nthe idea of going to the city and finding the secrets there. She wasn’t only\nrunning. She’d also be helping Adolin reclaim his home.\nPattern hummed from her skirts, and she hummed along with him.\n52. After His Father\nEIGHTEEN AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nDalinar plodded back into camp, so tired he suspected only the energy of\nhis Plate was keeping him upright. Each muggy breath inside his helm\nfogged the metal, which—as always—went somewhat transparent from the\ninside when you engaged the visor.\nHe’d crushed the Herdazians—sending them back to start a civil war,\nsecuring the Alethi lands to the north and claiming the island of Akak. Now\nhe’d moved southward, to engage the Vedens at the border. Herdaz had\ntaken far longer than Dalinar had expected. He’d been out on campaign a\ntotal of four years now.\nFour glorious years.\nDalinar walked straight to his armorers’ tent, picking up attendants and\nmessengers along the way. When he ignored their questions, they trailed\nafter him like cremlings eyeing a greatshell’s kill, waiting for their moment\nto snatch a tidbit.\nInside the tent, he extended his arms to the sides and let the armorers\nstart the disassembly. Helm, then arms, revealing the gambeson he wore for\npadding. The helm’s removal exposed sweaty, clammy skin that made the\nair feel too cold. The breastplate was cracked along the left side, and the\narmorers buzzed, discussing the repair. As if they had to do something other\nthan merely give the Plate Stormlight and let it regrow itself.\nEventually, all that remained were his boots, which he stepped out of,\nmaintaining a martial posture by pure force of will. The support of his Plate\nremoved, exhaustionspren began to shoot up around him like jets of dust.\nHe stepped over to a set of travel cushions and sat down, reclining against\nthem, sighing, and closing his eyes.\n“Brightlord?” one of the armorers asked. “Um … that’s where we set—”\n“This is now my audience tent,” Dalinar said, not opening his eyes.\n“Take what is absolutely essential and leave me.”\nThe clanking of armor stopped as the workers digested what he’d said.\nThey left in a whispering rush, and nobody else bothered him for a blissful\nfive minutes—until footfalls sounded nearby. Tent flaps rustled, then leather\nscrunched as someone knelt beside him.\n“The final battle report is here, Brightlord.” Kadash’s voice. Of course it\nwould be one of his storming officers. Dalinar had trained them far too well.\n“Speak,” Dalinar said, opening his eyes.\nKadash had reached middle age, maybe two or three years older than\nDalinar. He now had a twisting scar across his face and head from where a\nspear had hit him.\n“We completely routed them, Brightlord,” Kadash said. “Our archers and"

He now had a twisting scar across his face and head from where a\nspear had hit him.\n“We completely routed them, Brightlord,” Kadash said. “Our archers and\nlight infantry followed with an extended harry. We slew, by best count, two\nthousand—nearly half. We could have gotten more if we’d boxed them in to\nthe south.”\n“Never box in an enemy, Kadash,” Dalinar said. “You want them to be\nable to retreat, or they’ll fight you worse for it. A rout will serve us better\nthan an extermination. How many people did we lose?”\n“Barely two hundred.”\nDalinar nodded. Minimal losses, while delivering a devastating blow.\n“Sir,” Kadash said. “I’d say this raiding group is done for.”\n“We’ve still got many more to dig out. This will last years yet.”\n“Unless the Vedens send in an entire army and engage us in force.”\n“They won’t,” Dalinar said, rubbing his forehead. “Their king is too\nshrewd. It isn’t full-on war he wants; he only wanted to see if any contested\nland had suddenly become uncontested.”\n“Yes, Brightlord.”\n“Thank you for the report. Now get out of here and post some storming\nguards at the front so I can rest. Don’t let anyone in, not even the\nNightwatcher herself.”\n“Yes, sir.” Kadash crossed the tent to the flaps. “Um … sir, you were\nincredible out there. Like a tempest.”\nDalinar just closed his eyes and leaned back, fully determined to fall\nasleep in his clothing.\nSleep, unfortunately, refused to come. The report set his mind to\nconsidering implications.\nHis army had only one Soulcaster, for emergencies, which meant supply\ntrains. These borderlands were expansive, hilly, and the Vedens had better\ngenerals than the Herdazians. Defeating a mobile enemy was going to be\nhard in such circumstances, as this first battle proved. It would take\nplanning, maneuvering, and skirmish after skirmish to pin the various\ngroups of Vedens down and bring them into proper battle.\nHe yearned for those early days, when their fights had been more rowdy,\nless coordinated. Well, he wasn’t a youth anymore, and he’d learned in\nHerdaz that he no longer had Gavilar to do the hard parts of this job.\nDalinar had camps to supply, men to feed, and logistics to work out. This\nwas almost as bad as being back in the city, listening to scribes talk about\nsewage disposal.\nSave for one difference: Out here, he had a reward. At the end of all the\nplanning, the strategy, and the debates with generals, came the Thrill.\nIn fact, through his exhaustion, he was surprised to find that he could\nsense it still. Deep down, like the warmth of a rock that had known a recent\nfire. He was glad that the fighting had dragged on all these years. He was\nglad that the Herdazians had tried to seize that land, and that now the\nVedens wanted to test him. He was glad that other highprinces weren’t\nsending aid, but waiting to see what he could accomplish on his own.\nMost of all, he was glad that—despite today’s important battle—the"

Storms, he loved this feeling. Today, hundreds had\ntried to bring him down, and he’d left them ashen and broken.\nOutside his tent, people demanding his attention were turned away one\nafter another. He tried not to feel pleasure each time. He would answer their\nquestions eventually. Just … not now.\nThoughts finally released their grip on his brain, and he dipped toward\nslumber. Until one unexpected voice jerked him out of it and sent him\nbolting upright.\nThat was Evi.\nHe leapt to his feet. The Thrill surged again within him, drawn out of its\nown slumber. Dalinar ripped open the tent’s front flaps and gaped at the\nblonde-haired woman standing outside, wearing a Vorin havah—but with\nsturdy walking boots sticking out below.\n“Ah,” Evi said. “Husband.” She looked him up and down, and her\nexpression soured, lips puckering. “Has no person seen fit to order him a\nbath? Where are his grooms, to see him undressed properly?”\n“Why are you here?” Dalinar demanded. He hadn’t intended to roar it,\nbut he was so tired, so shocked …\nEvi leaned backward before the outburst, eyes opening wide.\nHe briefly felt a spike of shame. But why should he? This was his\nwarcamp—here he was the Blackthorn. This was the place where his\ndomestic life should have no purchase on him! By coming here, she\ninvaded that.\n“I…” Evi said. “I … Other women are at the camp. Other wives. It is\ncommon, for women to go to war.…”\n“Alethi women,” Dalinar snapped, “trained to it from childhood and\nacquainted with the ways of warfare. We spoke of this, Evi. We—” He\nhalted, looking at the guards. They shuffled uncomfortably.\n“Come inside, Evi,” Dalinar said. “Let’s discuss this in private.”\n“Very well. And the children?”\n“You brought our children to the battlefront?” Storms, she didn’t even\nhave the sense to leave them at the town the army was using as a long-term\ncommand post?\n“I—”\n“In,” Dalinar said, pointing at the tent.\nEvi wilted, then scuttled to obey, cringing as she passed him. Why had\nshe come? Hadn’t he just been back to Kholinar to visit? That had been …\nrecent, he was sure.…\nOr maybe not so recent. He did have several letters from Evi that Teleb’s\nwife had read to him, with several more waiting to be read. He dropped the\nflaps back into position and turned toward Evi, determined not to let his\nfrayed patience rule him.\n“Navani said I should come,” Evi said. “She said it was shameful that\nyou have waited so long between visits. Adolin has gone over a year\nwithout seeing you, Dalinar. And little Renarin has never even met his\nfather.”\n“Renarin?” Dalinar said, trying to work out the name. He hadn’t picked\nthat. “Rekher … no, Re…”"

In, to be born\nunto.”\nStormfather, that was a butchering of the language. Dalinar fumbled,\ntrying to work through it. Nar meant “like unto.”\n“What does ‘Re’ mean in your language?” Dalinar asked, scratching his\nface.\n“It has no meaning,” Evi said. “It is simply the name. It means our son’s\nname, or him.”\nDalinar groaned softly. So the child’s name was “Like one who was born\nunto himself.” Delightful.\n“You didn’t answer,” Evi pointed out, “when I asked after a name via\nspanreed.”\nHow had Navani and Ialai allowed this travesty of a name? Storms …\nknowing those two, they’d probably encouraged it. They were always trying\nto get Evi to be more forceful. He moved to get something to drink, but then\nremembered that this wasn’t actually his tent. There wasn’t anything in here\nto drink but armor oil.\n“You shouldn’t have come,” Dalinar said. “It is dangerous out here.”\n“I wish to be a more Alethi wife. I want you to want me to be with you.”\nHe winced. “Well, you still should not have brought the children.”\nDalinar slumped down into the cushions. “They are heirs to the princedom,\nassuming this plan of Gavilar’s with the Crownlands and his own throne\nworks out. They need to remain safe in Kholinar.”\n“I thought you’d want to see them,” Evi said, stepping up to him.\nDespite his harsh words, she unbuckled the top of his gambeson to get her\nhands under it, and began rubbing his shoulders.\nIt felt wonderful. He let his anger melt away. It would be good to have a\nwife with him, to scribe as was proper. He just wished that he didn’t feel so\nguilty at seeing her. He was not the man she wanted him to be.\n“I hear you had a great victory today,” Evi said softly. “You do service to\nthe king.”\n“You’d have hated it, Evi. I killed hundreds of people. If you stay, you’ll\nhave to listen to war reports. Accounts of deaths, many at my hand.”\nShe was silent for a time. “Could you not … let them surrender to you?”\n“The Vedens aren’t here to surrender. They’re here to test us on the\nbattlefield.”\n“And the individual men? Do they care for such reasoning as they die?”\n“What? Would you like me to stop and ask each man to surrender as I\nprepare to strike him down?”\n“Would that—”\n“No, Evi. That wouldn’t work.”\n“Oh.”\nHe stood up, suddenly anxious. “Let’s see the boys, then.”\nLeaving his tent and crossing the camp was a slog, his feet feeling like\nthey’d been encased in blocks of crem.

The thick grass was\nbroken by sturdy stands of trees, and tangled vines draped the western cliff\nfaces. There were places farther into Jah Keved where you couldn’t take a\nstep without vines writhing under your feet.\nThe boys were by Evi’s wagons. Little Adolin was terrorizing one of the\nchulls, perched atop its shell and swinging a wooden sword about, showing\noff for several of the guards—who dutifully complimented his moves. He’d\nsomehow assembled “armor” from strings and bits of broken rockbud shell.\nStorms, he’s grown, Dalinar thought. When last he’d seen Adolin, the\nchild had still looked like a toddler, stumbling through his words. Little\nover a year later, the boy spoke clearly—and dramatically—as he described\nhis fallen enemies. They were, apparently, evil flying chulls.\nHe stopped when he saw Dalinar, then he glanced at Evi. She nodded,\nand the child scrambled down from the chull—Dalinar was certain he’d fall\nat three different points. He got down safely, walked over.\nAnd saluted.\nEvi beamed. “He asked the best way to talk to you,” she whispered. “I\ntold him you were a general, the leader of all the soldiers. He came up with\nthat on his own.”\nDalinar squatted down. Little Adolin immediately shied back, reaching\nfor his mother’s skirts.\n“Afraid of me?” Dalinar asked. “Not unwise. I’m a dangerous man.”\n“Daddy?” the boy said, holding to the skirt with one white-knuckled\nhand—but not hiding.\n“Yes. Don’t you remember me?”\nHesitantly, the motley-haired boy nodded. “I remember you. We talk\nabout you every night when we burn prayers. So you will be safe. Fighting\nbad men.”\n“I’d prefer to be safe from the good ones too,” Dalinar said. “Though I\nwill take what I am offered.” He stood up, feeling … what? Shame to not\nhave seen the boy as often as he should have? Pride at how the boy was\ngrowing? The Thrill, still squirming deep down. How had it not dissipated\nsince the battle?\n“Where is your brother, Adolin?” Dalinar asked.\nThe boy pointed toward a nurse who carried a little one. Dalinar had\nexpected a baby, but this child could nearly walk, as evidenced by the nurse\nputting him down and watching fondly as he toddled a few steps, then sat,\ntrying to grab blades of grass as they pulled away.\nThe child made no sounds. He just stared, solemn, as he tried to grip\nblade after blade. Dalinar waited for the excitement he’d felt before, upon\nmeeting Adolin for the first time … but storms, he was just so tired.\n“Can I see your sword?” Adolin asked.\nDalinar wanted nothing more than to sleep, but he summoned the Blade\nanyway, driving it into the ground with the edge pointed away from Adolin.\nThe boy’s eyes grew wide.\n“Mommy says I can’t have my Plate yet,” Adolin said."

Like you did.”\n“A worthy goal,” Dalinar said. “But a soldier needs to be willing to\naccept help.

Then, at last,\nDalinar was able to sleep.\n53. Such a Twisted Cut\nFriend,\nYour letter is most intriguing, even revelatory.\nThe ancient Siln dynasty in Jah Keved had been founded after the death of\nKing NanKhet. No contemporary accounts survived; the best they had dated\nfrom two centuries later. The author of that text—Natata Ved, often called\nOileyes by her contemporaries—insisted that her methods were rigorous,\nalthough by modern standards, historical scholarship had been in its\ninfancy.\nJasnah had long been interested in NanKhet’s death, because he’d ruled\nfor only three months. He’d succeeded to the throne when the previous\nking, his brother NanHar, had taken ill and died while on campaign in what\nwould become modern Triax.\nRemarkably, during the brief span of his reign, NanKhet survived six\nassassination attempts. The first had come from his sister, who had wanted\nto place her husband on the throne. After surviving poisoning, NanKhet had\nput them both to death. Soon after, their son had tried to kill him in his bed.\nNanKhet, apparently a light sleeper, struck down his nephew with his own\nsword.\nNanKhet’s cousin tried next—that attack left NanKhet blinded in one\neye—and was followed by another brother, an uncle, and finally NanKhet’s\nown son. At the end of three exasperating months, according to Oileyes,\n“The great, but weary, NanKhet called for an accounting of all his\nhousehold. He gathered them together at a grand feast, promising the\ndelights of distant Aimia. Instead, when all were assembled, NanKhet had\nthem executed one by one. Their bodies were burned in a grand pyre, upon\nwhich was cooked the meat for the feast that he ate alone, at a table set for\ntwo hundred.”\nNatata Oileyes was known to have had a passion for the dramatic. The\ntext sounded almost delighted when she’d explained how he’d died by\nchoking on the food at that very feast, alone with nobody to help him."

The\ntext sounded almost delighted when she’d explained how he’d died by\nchoking on the food at that very feast, alone with nobody to help him.\nSimilar tales repeated themselves throughout the long history of the\nVorin lands. Kings fell, and their brothers or sons took the throne. Even a\npretender of no true lineage would usually claim kinship through oblique\nand creative genealogical justifications.\nJasnah was simultaneously fascinated and worried by these accounts.\nThoughts about them were unusually present in her mind as she made her\nway into Urithiru’s basement. Something in her readings the night before\nhad lodged this particular story in her brain.\nShe soon peeked into the former library beneath Urithiru. Both rooms—\none on either side of the hallway that led to the crystal pillar—were filled\nwith scholars now, occupying tables carried down by squads of soldiers.\nDalinar had sent expeditions down the tunnel the Unmade had used to flee.\nThe scouts reported a long network of caverns.\nFollowing a stream of water, they’d marched for days, and eventually\nlocated an exit into the mountain foothills of Tu Fallia. It was nice to know\nthat, in a pinch, there was another way out of Urithiru—and a potential\nmeans of supply other than through the Oathgates.\nThey maintained guards in the upper tunnels, and for now it seemed safe\nenough in the basement. Therefore, Navani had transformed the area into a\nscholarly institute designed to solve Dalinar’s problems and to provide an\nedge in information, technology, and pure research. Concentrationspren\nrippled in the air like waves overhead—a rarity in Alethkar, but common\nhere—and logicspren darted through them, like tiny stormclouds.\nJasnah couldn’t help but smile. For over a decade, she’d dreamed of\nuniting the best minds of the kingdom in a coordinated effort. She’d been\nignored; all anyone had wanted to discuss was her lack of belief in their\ngod. Well, they were focused now. Turned out that the end of the world had\nto actually arrive before people would take it seriously.\nRenarin was there, standing near the corner, watching the work. He’d\nbeen joining the scholars with some regularity, but he still wore his uniform\nwith the Bridge Four patch.\nYou can’t spend forever floating between worlds, Cousin, she thought.\nEventually you’ll need to decide where you want to belong. Life was so\nmuch harder, but potentially so much more fulfilling, when you found the\ncourage to choose.\nThe story of the old Veden king, NanKhet, had taught Jasnah something\ntroubling: Often, the greatest threat to a ruling family was its own members.\nWhy were so many of the old royal lines such knots of murder, greed, and\ninfighting? And what made the few exceptions different?\nShe’d grown adept at protecting her family against danger from without,\ncarefully removing would-be deposers. But what could she do to protect it\nfrom within? In her absence, already the monarchy trembled. Her brother\nand her uncle—who she knew loved each other deeply—ground their wills\nagainst one another like mismatched gears.\nShe would not have her family implode. If Alethkar was going to survive"

It was in a\nposition where she could survey the others and have her back to a wall.\nShe unpacked her satchel, setting up two spanreed boards. One of the\nreeds was blinking early, and she twisted the ruby, indicating she was ready.\nA message came back, writing out, We will begin in five minutes.\nShe passed the time scrutinizing the various groups in the room, reading\nthe lips of those she could see, absently taking notes in shorthand. She\nmoved from conversation to conversation, gleaning a little from each one\nand noting the names of the people who spoke.\n—tests confirm something is different here.

Perhaps if we could find a way to conjoin the fabrials, we\ncould imitate this effect—\n—the boy could be a powerful addition to our ranks. He shows interest in\nnumerology, and asked me if we can truly predict events with it. I will speak\nwith him again—\nThat last one was from the stormwardens. Jasnah tightly pursed her lips.\n“Ivory?” she whispered.\n“I will watch them.”\nHe left her side, shrunken to the size of a speck of dust. Jasnah made a\nnote to speak to Renarin; she would not have him wasting his time with a\nbunch of fools who thought they could foretell the future based on the curls\nof smoke from a snuffed candle.\nFinally, her spanreed woke up.\nI have connected Jochi of Thaylenah and Ethid of Azir for you,\nBrightness. Here are their passcodes. Further entries will be strictly their\nnotations.\nExcellent, Jasnah wrote back, authenticating the two passcodes. Losing\nher spanreeds in the sinking of the Wind’s Pleasure had been a huge\nsetback. She could no longer directly contact important colleagues or\ninformants. Fortunately, Tashikk was set up to deal with these kinds of\nsituations. You could always buy new reeds connected to the princedom’s\ninfamous information centers.\nYou could reach anyone, in practice, so long as you trusted an\nintermediary. Jasnah had one of those she’d personally interviewed—and\nwhom she paid good money—to ensure confidentiality. The intermediary\nwould burn her copies of this conversation afterward. The system was as\nsecure as Jasnah could make it, all things considered.\nJasnah’s intermediary would now be joined by two others in Tashikk.\nTogether, the three would be surrounded by six spanreed boards: one each\nfor receiving comments from their masters, and one each to send back the\nentire conversation in real time, including the comments from the other two.\nThat way, each conversant would be able to see a constant stream of\ncomments, without having to stop and wait before replying.\nNavani talked of ways to improve the experience—of spanreeds that"

Back from the dead. Remarkable!\nI can’t believe you ever thought she was dead, Ethid replied. Jasnah\nKholin? Lost at sea? Likelier we’d find the Stormfather dead.\nYour confidence is comforting, Ethid, Jasnah wrote on her sending board.\nA moment later, those words were copied by her scribe into the common\nspanreed conversation.\nAre you at Urithiru? Jochi wrote. When can I visit?\nAs soon as you’re willing to let everyone know you aren’t female, Jasnah\nwrote back. Jochi—known to the world as a dynamic woman of distinctive\nphilosophy—was a pen name for a potbellied man in his sixties who ran a\npastry shop in Thaylen City.\nOh, I’m certain your wonderful city has need of pastries, Jochi wrote\nback jovially.\nCan we please discuss your silliness later? Ethid wrote. I have news. She\nwas a scion—a kind of religious order of scribe—at the Azish royal palace.\nWell stop wasting time then! Jochi wrote. I love news. Goes excellently\nwith a filled doughnut … no, no, a fluffy brioche.\nThe news? Jasnah just wrote, smiling. These two had studied with her\nunder the same master—they were Veristitalians of the keenest mind,\nregardless of how Jochi might seem.\nI’ve been tracking a man we are increasingly certain is the Herald\nNakku, the Judge, Ethid wrote. Nalan, as you call him.\nOh, are we sharing nursery tales now? Jochi asked. Heralds? Really,\nEthid?\nIf you haven’t noticed, Ethid wrote, the Voidbringers are back. Tales we\ndismissed are worth a second look, now.\nI agree, Jasnah wrote. But what makes you think you’ve found one of the\nHeralds?\nIt’s a combination of many things, she wrote. This man attacked our\npalace, Jasnah. He tried to kill some thieves—the new Prime is one of them,\nbut keep that in your sleeve. We’re doing what we can to play up his\ncommon roots while ignoring the fact that he was intent on robbing us.\nHeralds alive and trying to kill people, Jochi wrote. And here I thought\nmy news about a sighting of Axies the Collector was interesting.\nThere’s more, Ethid wrote. Jasnah, we’ve got a Radiant here. An\nEdgedancer. Or … we had one.\nHad one? Jochi wrote. Did you misplace her?\nShe ran off. She’s just a kid, Jasnah. Reshi, raised on the streets.\nI think we may have met her, Jasnah wrote.

She\nchased after the Herald to Tashikk, but the Prime says she is back now—\nand avoiding me. In any case, something’s wrong with the man I think is\nNalan, Jasnah. I don’t think the Heralds will be a resource to us.\nI will provide you with sketches of the Heralds, Jasnah said. I have\ndrawings of their true faces, provided by an unexpected source. Ethid, you\nare right about them. They aren’t going to be a resource; they’re broken.\nHave you read the accounts of my uncle’s visions?\nI have copies somewhere, Ethid wrote. Are they real? Most sources agree\nthat he’s … unwell.\nHe’s quite well, I assure you, Jasnah wrote. The visions are related to his\norder of Radiants. I will send you the latest few; they have relevance to the\nHeralds.\nStorms, Ethid wrote. The Blackthorn is actually a Radiant? Years of\ndrought, and now they’re popping up like rockbuds.\nEthid did not think highly of men who earned their reputations through\nconquest, despite having made the study of such men a cornerstone of her\nresearch.\nThe conversation continued for some time. Jochi, growing\nuncharacteristically solemn, spoke directly of the state of Thaylenah. It had\nbeen hit hard by the repeated coming of the Everstorm; entire sections of\nThaylen City were in ruin.\nJasnah was most interested in the Thaylen parshmen who had stolen the\nships that had survived the storm. Their exodus—combined with Kaladin\nStormblessed’s interactions with the parshmen in Alethkar—was painting a\nnew picture of what and who the Voidbringers were.\nThe conversation moved on as Ethid transcribed an interesting account\nshe’d discovered in an old book discussing the Desolations. From there,\nthey spoke of the Dawnchant translations, in particular those by some\nardents in Jah Keved who were ahead of the scholars at Kharbranth.\nJasnah glanced through the library room, seeking out her mother, who\nwas sitting near Shallan to discuss wedding preparations.

I saw the Edgedancer\nspren personally, after demanding a glimpse.\nWhat of the Truthwatchers? Jasnah wrote.\nOh! I found a reference to those, Jochi wrote.

She slipped\noff her seat and crossed the room, passing near Navani and Shallan.\n“I don’t want to push you at all, dear,” Navani was saying. “But in these\nuncertain times, surely you wish for stability.”\nJasnah stopped, freehand resting idly on Shallan’s shoulder. The younger\nwoman perked up, then followed Jasnah’s gaze toward Renarin.\n“What?” Shallan whispered.\n“I don’t know,” Jasnah said. “Something odd…”\nSomething about the way the youth was standing, the words he had\nspoken. He still looked wrong to her without his spectacles. Like a different\nperson entirely.\n“Jasnah!” Shallan said, suddenly tense. “The doorway. Look!”\nJasnah sucked in Stormlight at the girl’s tone and turned away from\nRenarin, toward the room’s doorway. There, a tall, square-jawed man had\ndarkened the opening. He wore Sadeas’s colors, forest green and white. In\nfact, he was Sadeas now, at least its regent.\nJasnah would always know him as Meridas Amaram.\n“What’s he doing here?” Shallan hissed.\n“He’s a highprince,” Navani said. “The soldiers aren’t going to forbid\nhim without a direct command.”\nAmaram fixated on Jasnah with regal, light tan eyes. He strode toward\nher, exuding confidence, or was it conceit? “Jasnah,” he said when he drew\nclose. “I was told I could find you here.”\n“Remind me to find whoever told you,” Jasnah said, “and have them\nhanged.”\nAmaram stiffened. “Could we speak together more privately, just for a\nmoment?”\n“I think not.”\n“We need to discuss your uncle. The rift between our houses serves\nnobody. I wish to bridge that chasm, and Dalinar listens to you. Please,\nJasnah. You can steer him properly.”\n“My uncle knows his own mind on these matters, and doesn’t require me\nto ‘steer’ him.”\n“As if you haven’t been doing so already, Jasnah. Everyone can see that\nhe has started to share your religious beliefs.”\n“Which would be incredible, since I don’t have religious beliefs.”\nAmaram sighed, looking around. “Please,” he said. “Private?”\n“Not a chance, Meridas. Go. Away.”\n“We were close once.”\n“My father wished us to be close. Do not mistake his fancies for fact.”\n“Jasnah—”\n“You really should leave before somebody gets hurt.”\nHe ignored her suggestion, glancing at Navani and Shallan, then\nstepping closer. “We thought you were dead. I needed to see for myself that\nyou are well.”\n“You have seen. Now leave.”\nInstead, he gripped her forearm. “Why, Jasnah? Why have you always\ndenied me?”\n“Other than the fact that you are a detestable buffoon who achieves only\nthe lowest level of mediocrity, as it is the best your limited mind can\nimagine? I can’t possibly think of a reason.”"

I can’t possibly think of a reason.”\n“Mediocre?” Amaram growled. “You insult my mother, Jasnah. You\nknow how hard she worked to raise me to be the best soldier this kingdom\nhas ever known.”\n“Yes, from what I understand, she spent the seven months she was with\nchild entertaining each and every military man she could find, in the hopes\nthat something of them would stick to you.”\nMeridas’s eyes widened, and his face flushed deeply. To their side,\nShallan audibly gasped.\n“You godless whore,” Amaram hissed, releasing her. “If you weren’t a\nwoman…”\n“If I weren’t a woman, I suspect we wouldn’t be having this\nconversation. Unless I were a pig. Then you’d be doubly interested.”\nHe thrust his hand to the side, stepping back, preparing to summon his\nBlade.\nJasnah smiled, holding her freehand toward him, letting Stormlight curl\nand rise from it. “Oh, please do, Meridas. Give me an excuse. I dare you.”\nHe stared at her hand. The entire room had gone silent, of course. He’d\nforced her to make a spectacle. His eyes flicked up to meet hers; then he\nspun and stalked from the room, shoulders hunched as if trying to shrug\naway the eyes—and the snickers—of the scholars.\nHe will be trouble, Jasnah thought. Even more than he has been.\nAmaram genuinely thought he was Alethkar’s only hope and salvation, and\nhad a keen desire to prove it. Left alone, he’d rip the armies apart to justify\nhis inflated opinion of himself.\nShe’d speak with Dalinar. Perhaps the two of them could devise\nsomething to keep Amaram safely occupied. And if that didn’t work, she\nwouldn’t speak to Dalinar about the other precaution she would take. She’d\nbeen out of touch for a long time, but she was confident there would be\nassassins for hire here, ones who knew her reputation for discretion and\nexcellent pay.\nA high-pitched sound came from beside her, and Jasnah glanced to find\nShallan sitting perkily on her seat, making an excited noise in the back of\nher throat and clapping her hands together quickly, the sound muffled by\nher clothed safehand.\nWonderful.\n“Mother,” Jasnah said, “might I speak for a moment with my ward?”\nNavani nodded, her eyes lingering on the doorway where Amaram had\nexited. Once, she’d pushed for the union between them. Jasnah didn’t blame\nher; the truth of Amaram was difficult to see, and had been even more so in\nthe past, when he’d been close to Jasnah’s father.\nNavani withdrew, leaving Shallan alone at the table stacked with reports.\n“Brightness!” Shallan said as Jasnah sat. “That was incredible!”\n“I let myself be pushed into abundant emotion.”\n“You were so clever!”\n“And yet, my first insult was not to attack him, but the moral reputation\nof his female relative. Clever? Or simply the use of an obvious bludgeon?”\n“Oh. Um … Well…”"

This girl …\n“Brightness,” Shallan said, “I think I might have to request a leave from\nmy studies.” Shallan spoke so quickly the words ran into one another. “His\nMajesty says he needs me to go with him on the expedition to Kholinar.”\nJasnah frowned. Kholinar? “Nonsense. They’ll have the Windrunner\nwith them. Why do they need you?”\n“The king is worried they might need to sneak into the city,” Shallan\nsaid. “Or even through the middle of it, if it’s occupied. We can’t know how\nfar the siege has progressed. If Elhokar has to reach the Oathgate without\nbeing recognized, then my illusions will be invaluable. I have to go. It’s so\ninconvenient. I’m sorry.” She took a deep breath, eyes wide, as if afraid that\nJasnah would snap at her.\nThis girl.\n“I’ll speak with Elhokar,” Jasnah said. “I feel that might be extreme. For\nnow, I want you to do drawings of Renarin’s and Kaladin’s spren, for\nscholarly reasons. Bring them to me for…” She trailed off. “What is he\ndoing?”\nRenarin stood near the far wall, which was covered in palm-size tiles. He\ntapped a specific one, and somehow made it pop out, like a drawer.\nJasnah stood, throwing back her chair. She strode across the room,\nShallan scampering along behind her.\nRenarin glanced at them, then held up what he’d found in the small\ndrawer. A ruby, long as Jasnah’s thumb, cut into a strange shape with holes\ndrilled in it. What on Roshar? She took it from him and held it up.\n“What is it?” Navani said, shouldering up beside her. “A fabrial? No\nmetal parts. What is that shape?”\nJasnah reluctantly surrendered it to her mother.\n“So many imperfections in the cut,” Navani said. “That will cause it to\nlose Stormlight quickly. It won’t even hold a charge for a day, I bet. And it\nwill vibrate something fierce.”\nCurious. Jasnah touched it, infusing the gemstone with Stormlight. It\nstarted glowing, but not nearly as brightly as it should have. Navani was, of\ncourse, right. It vibrated as Stormlight curled off it. Why would anyone\nspoil a gem with such a twisted cut, and why hide it? The small drawer was\nlatched with a spring, but she couldn’t see how Renarin had gotten it\nundone.\n“Storms,” Shallan whispered as other scholars crowded around. “That’s\na pattern.”\n“A pattern?”"

It does me so\nmuch good to know that our misery is now at the hands of our own people.”\nThe parshwoman set her bundle down with a rattling thump.\n“You’ll get us in trouble again, talking like that,” Sah said. He dropped\nhis bundle of wooden poles, then walked back the other way.\nMoash followed, passing rows of humans and parshmen turning the\npoles into ladders. These, like Sah and the rest of his team, would soon be\ncarrying those ladders into battle, facing down a storm of arrows.\nWhat a strange echo of his life months ago in Sadeas’s warcamp. Except\nhere he’d been given sturdy gloves, a nice pair of boots, and three solid\nmeals a day. The only thing wrong with the situation—other than the fact\nthat he and the others would soon be charging a fortified position—was that\nhe had too much free time.\nThe workers hauled stacks of wood from one part of the lumberyard to\nthe next, and were occasionally assigned to saw or chop. But there wasn’t\nenough to keep them busy. That was a very bad thing, as he’d learned on the\nShattered Plains. Give condemned men too much time and they’d start to\nask questions.\n“Look,” Khen said, walking next to Sah just ahead, “at least tell me\nyou’re angry, Sah. Don’t tell me you think we deserve this.”\n“We harbored a spy,” Sah muttered.\nA spy that, Moash had quickly learned, had been none other than\nKaladin Stormblessed.\n“Like a bunch of slaves should be able to spot a spy?” Khen said.\n“Really? Shouldn’t the spren have been the one to spot him? It’s like they\nwanted something to pin on us. Like it’s … it’s a…”\n“Like it’s a setup?” Moash asked from behind.\n“Yeah, a setup,” Khen agreed.\nThey did that a lot, forgetting words.

Give up your\npain. It’s all right. You did what was natural.\nYou can’t be blamed. Stop carrying that burden.\nLet go.\nThey each picked up another bundle and began walking back. They\npassed the carpenters who were making the ladder poles. Most of these\nwere parshmen, and one of the Fused walked among their ranks. He was a\nhead taller than the parshmen, and was a subspecies that grew large portions\nof carapace armor in wicked shapes.\nThe Fused stopped, then explained something to one of the working\nparshmen. The Fused made a fist, and dark violet energy surrounded his\narm. Carapace grew there into the shape of a saw. The Fused sawed,\ncarefully explaining what he did. Moash had seen this before. Some of these\nmonsters from the void were carpenters.\nOut beyond the lumberyards, parshman troops practiced close-order drill\nand received basic weapon training. Word was that the army intended to\nassault Kholinar within weeks. That was ambitious, but they didn’t have\ntime for an extended siege. Kholinar had Soulcasters to make food, while\nthe Voidbringer operations in the country would take months to get going.\nThis Voidbringer army would soon eat itself out of supplies, and would\nhave to divide up to forage. Better to attack, use overwhelming numbers,\nand seize the Soulcasters for themselves.\nEvery army needed someone to run at the front and soak up arrows.

He slammed\nhis bundle down, but then stalked off, out of the lumberyard.\nAn overseer yelped loudly and scuttled after him—but she didn’t stop\nhim, and neither did the guards he passed. He had a reputation.\nMoash strode through the city, tailed by the overseer, searching for one\nof the flying type of Fused. They seemed to be in charge, even of the other\nFused.\nHe couldn’t find one, so he settled for approaching one of the other\nsubspecies: a malen that sat near the city’s cistern, where rainwater\ncollected. The creature was of the heavily armored type, with no hair, the\ncarapace encroaching across his cheeks.\nMoash strode right up to the creature. “I need to talk to someone in\ncharge.”\nBehind him, Moash’s overseer gasped—perhaps only now realizing that\nwhatever it was Moash was up to, it could get her in serious trouble.\nThe Fused regarded him and grinned.\n“Someone in charge,” Moash repeated.\nThe Voidbringer laughed, then fell backward into the water of the\ncistern, where he floated, staring at the sky.\nGreat, Moash thought. One of the crazy ones. There were many of those.\nMoash stalked away, but didn’t get much farther into the town before\nsomething dropped from the sky. Cloth fluttered in the air, and in the middle\nof it floated a creature with skin that matched the black and red clothing. He\ncouldn’t tell if it was malen or femalen.\n“Little human,” the creature said with a foreign accent, “you are\npassionate and interesting.”\nMoash licked his lips. “I need to talk to someone in charge.”\n“You need nothing but what we give you,” the Fused said. “But your\ndesire is to be granted. Lady Leshwi will see you.”\n“Great. Where can I find her?”\nThe Fused pressed its hand against his chest and smiled. Dark Voidlight\nspread from its hand across Moash’s body. Both of them rose into the air.\nPanicking, Moash clutched at the Fused. Could he get the creature into a\nchokehold? Then what? If he killed it up here, he’d drop to his own death.\nThey rose until the town looked like a tiny model: lumberyard and\nparade ground on one side, the single prominent street down the center. To\nthe right, the man-made ward provided a buffer against the highstorms,\ncreating a shelter for trees and the citylord’s mansion.\nThey ascended even farther, the Fused’s loose clothes fluttering. Though\nthe air was warm at ground level, up here it was quite chilly, and Moash’s\nears felt odd—dull, as if they were stuffed with cloth.\nFinally, the Fused slowed them to a hovering stop. Though Moash tried\nto hold on, the Fused shoved him to the side, then zoomed away in a flaring\nroil of cloth.\nMoash drifted alone above the expansive landscape. His heart thundered,"

His heart thundered,\nand he regarded that drop, realizing something. He did not want to die.\nHe forced himself to twist and look about him. He felt a surge of hope as\nhe found he was drifting toward another Fused. A woman who hovered in\nthe sky, wearing robes that must have extended a good ten feet below her,\nlike a smear of red paint. Moash drifted right up beside her, getting so close\nthat she was able to reach out and stop him.\nHe resisted grabbing that arm and hanging on for dear life. His mind was\ncatching up to what was happening—she wanted to meet him, but in a\nrealm where she belonged and he did not. Well, he would contain his fear.\n“Moash,” the Fused said. Leshwi, the other had called her. She had a\nface that was all three Parshendi colors: white, red, and black, marbled like\npaint swirled together. He had rarely seen someone who was all three colors\nbefore, and this was one of the most transfixing patterns he’d seen, almost\nliquid in its effect, her eyes like pools around which the colors ran.\n“How do you know my name?” Moash asked.\n“Your overseer told me,” Leshwi said. She had a distinct serenity about\nher as she floated with feet down. The wind up here tugged at the ribbons\nshe wore, pushing them backward in careless ripples. There were no\nwindspren in sight, oddly. “Where did you get that name?”\n“My grandfather named me,” Moash said, frowning. This was not how\nhe’d anticipated this conversation going.\n“Curious. Do you know that it is one of our names?”\n“It is?”\nShe nodded. “How long has it drifted on the tides of time, passing from\nthe lips of singers to men and back, to end up here, on the head of a human\nslave?”\n“Look, you’re one of the leaders?”\n“I’m one of the Fused who is sane,” she said, as if it were the same\nthing.\n“Then I need to—”\n“You’re bold,” Leshwi said, eyes forward. “Many of the singers we left\nhere are not. We find them remarkable, considering how long they were\nabused by your people. But still, they are not bold enough.”\nShe looked to him for the first time during the conversation. Her face\nwas angular, with long flowing parshman hair—black and crimson, thicker\nthan that of a human. Almost like thin reeds or blades of grass. Her eyes\nwere a deep red, like pools of shimmering blood.\n“Where did you learn the Surges, human?” she asked.\n“The Surges?”\n“When you killed me,” she said, “you were Lashed to the sky—but you\nresponded quickly, with familiarity. I will say, without guile, that I was\nfurious to be caught so unaware.”\n“Wait,” Moash said, cold. “When I killed you?”\nShe regarded him, unblinking, with those ruby eyes.\n“You’re the same one?” Moash asked.

It’s the same as the one I fought. But the features were different.\n“This is a new body offered to me in sacrifice,” Leshwi said. “To bond\nand make my own, as I have none.”\n“You’re some kind of spren?”\nShe blinked but did not reply.\nMoash started to drop. He felt it in his clothes, which lost their power to\nfly first. He cried out, reaching toward the Fused woman, and she seized\nhim by the wrist and injected him with more Voidlight. It surged across his\nbody, and he hovered again. The violet darkness retreated, visible again\nonly as faint periodic crackles on her skin.\n“My companions spared you,” she said to him. “Brought you here, to\nthese lands, as they thought I might wish personal vengeance once reborn. I\ndid not. Why would I destroy that which had such passion? Instead I\nwatched you, curious to see what you did. I saw you help the singers who\nwere pulling the sledges.”\nMoash took a deep breath. “Can you tell me, then, why you treat your\nown so poorly?”\n“Poorly?” she said, sounding amused. “They are fed, clothed, and\ntrained.”\n“Not all of them,” Moash said. “You had those poor parshmen working\nas slaves, like humans. And now you’re going to throw them at the city\nwalls.”\n“Sacrifice,” she said. “Do you think an empire is built without sacrifice?”\nShe swept her arm across the landscape before them.\nMoash’s stomach turned over; he’d briefly been able to fixate only on her\nand forget exactly how high he was. Storms … this land was big. He could\nsee extensive hills, plains, grass, trees, and stone in all directions.\nAnd in the direction she gestured, a dark line on the horizon. Kholinar?\n“I breathe again because of their sacrifices,” Leshwi said. “And this\nworld will be ours, because of sacrifice. Those who fall will be sung of, but\ntheir blood is ours to demand. If they survive the assault, if they prove\nthemselves, then they will be honored.” She looked to him again. “You\nfought for them during the trip here.”\n“Honestly, I expected you to have me killed for that.”\n“If you were not killed for striking down one of the Fused,” she said,\n“then why would you be killed for striking one of our lessers? In both cases,\nhuman, you proved your passion and earned your right to succeed. Then\nyou bowed to authority when presented, and earned your right to continue\nto live. Tell me. Why did you protect those slaves?”\n“Because you need to be unified,” Moash said. He swallowed. “My\npeople don’t deserve this land. We’re broken, ruined. Incapable.”\nShe cocked her head. A cool wind played with her clothing. “And are\nyou not angered that we took your Shards?”\n“They were first given me by a man I betrayed. I … don’t deserve them.”\nNo. Not you. It’s not your fault."

Still burning. Deep down.\nStorm it, Kaladin had been protecting a murderer.\n“Vengeance,” he whispered.\n“Yes, I understand.” She looked at him, smiling in what seemed to him a\ndistinctly sinister way. “Do you know why we fight? Let me tell you.…”\n* * *\nA half hour later as evening approached, Moash walked the streets of a\nconquered town. By himself. Lady Leshwi had ordered that Moash be left\nalone, freed.\nHe walked with his hands in the pockets of his Bridge Four coat,\nremembering the frigid air up above. He still felt chilled, even though down\nhere it was muggy and warm.\nThis was a nice town. Quaint. Little stone buildings, plants growing at\nthe backs of every house. On his left, that meant cultivated rockbuds and\nbushes burst from around doors—but to his right, facing the storm, there\nwere only blank stone walls. Not even a window.\nThe plants smelled of civilization to him. A sort of civic perfume that\nyou didn’t get out in the wilds. They barely quivered as he passed, though\nlifespren bobbed at his presence. The plants were accustomed to people on\nthe streets.\nHe finally stopped at a low fence surrounding pens holding the horses\nthe Voidbringers had captured. The animals munched cut grass the\nparshmen had thrown to them.\nSuch strange beasts. Hard to care for, expensive to keep. He turned from\nthe horses and looked out over the fields toward Kholinar. She’d said he\ncould leave. Join the refugees making for the capital. Defend the city.\nWhat is your passionate fury?\nThousands of years being reborn. What would it be like? Thousands of\nyears, and they’d never given up.\nProve yourself …\nHe turned and made his way back to the lumberyard, where the workers\nwere packing up for the day. There was no storm projected tonight, and they\nwouldn’t have to secure everything, so they worked with a relaxed, almost\njovial air. All save for his crew, who—as usual—gathered by themselves,\nostracized.\nMoash seized a bundle of ladder rods off a pile. The workers there turned\nto object, but cut off when they saw who it was. He untied the bundle and,\nupon reaching the crew of unfortunate parshmen, tossed a length of wood to\neach one.\nSah caught his and stood up, frowning. The others mimicked him.\n“I can train you with those,” Moash said.\n“Sticks?” Khen asked.\n“Spears,” Moash said. “I can teach you to be soldiers. We’ll probably die\nanyway. Storm it, we’ll probably never make it to the top of the walls. But\nit’s something.”\nThe parshmen looked at one another, holding rods that could mimic\nspears.\n“I’ll do it,” Khen said."

Alone Together\nI am the least equipped, of all, to aid you in this endeavor. I am finding\nthat the powers I hold are in such conflict that the most simple of\nactions can be difficult.\nRlain sat on the Shattered Plains alone and listened to the rhythms.\nEnslaved parshmen, deprived of true forms, weren’t able to hear the\nrhythms. During his years spent as a spy, he’d adopted dullform, which\nheard them weakly. It had been so hard to be apart from them.\nThey weren’t quite true songs; they were beats with hints of tonality and\nharmony. He could attune one of several dozen to match his mood, or—\nconversely—to help alter his mood.\nHis people had always assumed the humans were deaf to the rhythms,\nbut he wasn’t convinced. Perhaps it was his imagination, but it seemed that\nsometimes they responded to certain rhythms. They’d look up at a moment\nof frenzied beats, eyes getting a far-off look. They’d grow agitated and\nshout in time, for a moment, to the Rhythm of Irritation, or whoop right on\nbeat with the Rhythm of Joy.\nIt comforted him to think that they might someday learn to hear the\nrhythms. Perhaps then he wouldn’t feel so alone.\nHe currently attuned the Rhythm of the Lost, a quiet yet violent beat\nwith sharp, separated notes. You attuned it to remember the fallen, and that\nfelt the correct emotion as he sat here outside Narak, watching humans\nbuild a fortress from what used to be his home. They set a watchpost atop\nthe central spire, where the Five had once met to discuss the future of his\npeople. They turned homes into barracks.\nHe was not offended—his own people had repurposed the ruins of\nStormseat into Narak. No doubt these stately ruins would outlast the Alethi\noccupation, as they had the listeners. That knowledge did not prevent him\nfrom mourning. His people were gone, now. Yes, parshmen had awakened,\nbut they were not listeners. No more than Alethi and Vedens were the same\nnationality, simply because most had similar skin tones.\nRlain’s people were gone. They had fallen to Alethi swords or had been\nconsumed by the Everstorm, transformed into incarnations of the old\nlistener gods. He was, as far as he knew, the last.\nHe sighed, pulling himself to his feet. He swung a spear to his shoulder,\nthe spear they let him carry. He loved the men of Bridge Four, but he was\nan oddity, even to them: the parshman they allowed to be armed. The\npotential Voidbringer they had decided to trust, and wasn’t he just so lucky.\nHe crossed the plateau to where a group of them trained under Teft’s\nwatchful eye. They didn’t wave to him. They often seemed surprised to find\nhim there, as if they’d forgotten he was around. But when Teft did notice\nhim, the man’s smile was genuine. They were his friends.

        "text": "him, the man’s smile was genuine. They were his friends. It was merely …\nHow could Rlain be so fond of these men, yet at the same time want to\nslap them?\nWhen he and Skar had been the only two who couldn’t draw Stormlight,\nthey’d encouraged Skar. They’d given him pep talks, told him to keep\ntrying. They had believed in him. Rlain, though … well, who knew what\nwould happen if he could use Stormlight? Might it be the first step in\nturning him into a monster?\nNever mind that he’d told them you had to open yourself to a form to\nadopt it. Never mind that he had the power to choose for himself. Though\nthey never spoke it, he saw the truth in their reactions. As with Dabbid, they\nthought it best that Rlain remain without Stormlight.\nThe parshman and the insane man. People you couldn’t trust as\nWindrunners.\nFive bridgemen launched into the air, Radiant and steaming with Light.\nSome of the crew trained while another group patrolled with Kaladin,\nchecking on caravans. A third group—the ten other newcomers that had\nlearned to draw in Stormlight—trained with Peet a few plateaus over. That\ngroup included Lyn and all four of the other scouts, along with four men\nfrom other bridge crews, and a single lighteyed officer. Colot, the archer\ncaptain.\nLyn had slid into Bridge Four’s comradery easily, as had a couple of the\nbridgemen. Rlain tried not to feel jealous that they almost seemed more a\npart of the team than he did.\nTeft led the five in the air through a formation while the four others\nstrolled toward Rock’s drink station. Rlain joined them, and Yake slapped\nhim on the back, pointing toward the next plateau over, where the bulk of\nthe hopefuls continued to train.\n“That group can barely hold a spear properly,” Yake said. “You ought to\ngo show them how a real bridgeman does a kata, eh, Rlain?”\n“Kalak help them if they have to fight those shellheads,” Eth added,\ntaking a drink from Rock. “Um, no offense, Rlain.”\nRlain touched his head, where he had carapace armor—distinctively\nthick and strong, as he held warform—covering his skull. It had stretched\nout his Bridge Four tattoo, which had transferred to the carapace. He had\nprotrusions on his arms and legs too, and people always wanted to feel\nthose. They couldn’t believe they actually grew from his skin, and somehow\nthought it was appropriate to try to peek underneath.\n“Rlain,” Rock said. “Is okay to throw things at Eth. He has hard head\ntoo, almost like he has shell.”\n“It’s all right,” Rlain said, because that was what they expected him to\nsay. He accidentally attuned Irritation, though, and the rhythm laced his\nwords.\nTo cover his embarrassment, he attuned Curiosity and tried Rock’s drink\nof the day. “This is good! What is in it?”\n“Ha! Is water I boiled cremlings in, before serving them last night.”\nEth spurted out his mouthful of drink, then looked at the cup, aghast.\n“What?” Rock said. “You ate the cremlings easily!”"

Is good taste.”\n“Is bathwater,” Eth said, imitating Rock’s accent.\nTeft led the other four in a streaking wave of light overhead. Rlain\nlooked up, and found himself attuning Longing before he stomped it out. He\nattuned Peace instead. Peace, yes. He could be peaceful.\n“This isn’t working,” Drehy said. “We can’t storming patrol the entirety\nof the Shattered Plains. More caravans are going to get hit, like that one last\nnight.”\n“The captain says it’s strange for those Voidbringers to keep raiding like\nthis,” Eth said.\n“Tell that to the caravaneers from yesterday.”\nYake shrugged. “They didn’t even burn much; we got there before the\nVoidbringers had time to do much more than frighten everyone. I’m with\nthe captain. It’s strange.”\n“Maybe they’re testing our abilities,” Eth said. “Seeing what Bridge\nFour can really do.”\nThey glanced at Rlain for confirmation.\n“Am … am I supposed to be able to answer?” he asked.\n“Well,” Eth said. “I mean … storms, Rlain. They’re your kinsmen.\nSurely you know something about them.”\n“You can guess, right?” Yake said.\nRock’s daughter refilled his cup for him, and Rlain looked down at the\nclear liquid. Don’t blame them, he thought. They don’t know. They don’t\nunderstand.\n“Eth, Yake,” Rlain said carefully, “my people did everything we could to\nseparate ourselves from those creatures. We went into hiding long ago, and\nswore we would never accept forms of power again.\n“I don’t know what changed. My people must have been tricked\nsomehow. In any case, these Fused are as much my enemies as they are\nyours—more, even. And no, I can’t say what they will do. I spent my entire\nlife trying to avoid thinking of them.”\nTeft’s group came crashing down to the plateau. For all his earlier\ndifficulty, Skar had quickly taken to flight. His landing was the most\ngraceful of the bunch. Hobber hit so hard he yelped.\nThey jogged over to the watering station, where Rock’s eldest daughter\nand son began giving them drinks. Rlain felt sorry for the two; they barely\nspoke Alethi, though the son—oddly—was Vorin. Apparently, monks came\nfrom Jah Keved to preach the Almighty to the Horneaters, and Rock let his\nchildren follow any god they wanted. So it was that the pale-skinned young\nHorneater wore a glyphward tied to his arm and burned prayers to the Vorin\nAlmighty instead of making offerings to the Horneater spren.\nRlain sipped his drink and wished Renarin were here; the quiet,\nlighteyed man usually made a point of speaking with Rlain. The others\njabbered excitedly, but didn’t think to include him. Parshmen were invisible\nto them—they’d been brought up that way."

Bridge Four was his\nfamily, now that those from Narak were gone. Eshonai, Varanis, Thude …\nHe attuned the Rhythm of the Lost and bowed his head. He had to\nbelieve that his friends in Bridge Four could feel a hint of the rhythms, for\notherwise how would they know how to mourn with true pain of soul?\nTeft was getting ready to take the other squad into the air when a group\nof dots in the sky announced the arrival of Kaladin Stormblessed. He landed\nwith his squad, including Lopen, who juggled an uncut gemstone the size of\na man’s head. They must have found a chrysalis from a beast of the chasms.\n“No sign of Voidbringers today,” Leyten said, turning over one of Rock’s\nbuckets and using it as a seat. “But storms … the Plains sure do seem\nsmaller when you’re up there.”\n“Yeah,” Lopen said. “And bigger.”\n“Smaller and bigger?” Skar asked.\n“Smaller,” Leyten said, “because we can cross them so fast. I remember\nplateaus that felt like they took years to cross. We zip past those in an\neyeblink.”\n“But then you get up high,” Lopen added, “and you realize how wide\nthis place is—sure, how much of it we never even explored—and it just\nseems … big.”\nThe others nodded, eager. You had to read their emotion in their\nexpressions and the way they moved, not in their voices. Maybe that was\nwhy emotion spren came so often to humans, more often than to listeners.\nWithout the rhythms, men needed help understanding one another.\n“Who’s on the next patrol?” Skar asked.\n“None for today,” Kaladin said. “I have a meeting with Dalinar. We’ll\nleave a squad in Narak, but…”\nSoon after he left through the Oathgate, everyone would slowly start to\nlose their powers. They’d be gone in an hour or two. Kaladin had to be\nrelatively near—Sigzil had placed their maximum distance from him at\naround fifty miles, though their abilities started to fade somewhere around\nthirty miles.\n“Fine,” Skar said. “I was looking forward to drinking more of Rock’s\ncremling juice anyway.”\n“Cremling juice?” Sigzil said, drink halfway to his lips. Other than\nRlain, Sigzil’s dark brown skin was the most different from the rest of the\ncrew—though the bridgemen didn’t seem to care much about skin color. To\nthem, only eyes mattered. Rlain had always found that strange, as among\nlisteners, your skin patterns had at times been a matter of some import."

Rlain had always found that strange, as among\nlisteners, your skin patterns had at times been a matter of some import.\n“So…” Skar said. “Are we going to talk about Renarin?”\nThe twenty-eight men shared looks, many settling down around the\nbarrel of Rock’s drink as they once had around the cookfire. There were\ncertainly a suspicious number of buckets to use as stools, as if Rock had\nplanned for this. The Horneater himself leaned against the table he’d\nbrought out for holding cups, a cleaning rag thrown over his shoulder.\n“What about him?” Kaladin asked, frowning and looking around at the\ngroup.\n“He’s been spending a lot of time with the scribes studying the tower\ncity,” Natam said.\n“The other day,” Skar added, “he was talking about what he’s doing\nthere. It sounded an awful lot like he was learning how to read.”\nThe men shifted uncomfortably.\n“So?” Kaladin asked. “What’s the problem? Sigzil can read his own\nlanguage. Storms, I can read glyphs.”\n“It’s not the same,” Skar said.\n“It’s feminine,” Drehy added.\n“Drehy,” Kaladin said, “you are literally courting a man.”\n“So?” Drehy said.\n“Yeah, what are you saying, Kal?” Skar snapped.\n“Nothing! I just thought Drehy might empathize.…”\n“That’s hardly fair,” Drehy said.\n“Yeah,” Lopen added. “Drehy likes other guys. That’s like … he wants\nto be even less around women than the rest of us. It’s the opposite of\nfeminine. He is, you could say, extra manly.”\n“Yeah,” Drehy said.\nKaladin rubbed his forehead, and Rlain empathized. It was sad that\nhumans were so burdened by always being in mateform. They were always\ndistracted by the emotions and passions of mating, and had not yet reached\na place where they could put that aside.\nHe felt embarrassed for them—they were simply too concerned about\nwhat a person should and shouldn’t be doing. It was because they didn’t\nhave forms to change into. If Renarin wanted to be a scholar, let him be a\nscholar.\n“I’m sorry,” Kaladin said, holding out his hand to calm the men. “I\nwasn’t trying to insult Drehy. But storms, men. We know that things are\nchanging. Look at the lot of us. We’re halfway to being lighteyes! We’ve\nalready let five women into Bridge Four, and they’ll be fighting with spears.\nExpectations are being upended—and we’re the cause of it. So let’s give\nRenarin a little leeway, shall we?”\nRlain nodded. Kaladin was a good man. For all his faults, he tried even\nmore than the rest of them.\n“I have thing to say,” Rock added. “During last few weeks, how many of\nyou have come to me, saying you feel you don’t fit in with Bridge Four\nnow?”\nThe plateau fell silent. Finally, Sigzil raised his hand. Followed by Skar.\nAnd several others, including Hobber.\n“Hobber, you did not come to me,” Rock noted."

Yeah, but I felt like it, Rock.” He glanced down. “Everything’s\nchanging. I don’t know if I can keep up.”\n“I still have nightmares,” Leyten said softly, “about what we saw in the\nbowels of Urithiru. Anyone else?”\n“I have trouble Alethi,” Huio said. “It makes me … embarrassing.\nAlone.”\n“I’m scared of heights,” Torfin added. “Flying up there is terrifying to\nme.”\nA few glanced at Teft.\n“What?” Teft demanded. “You expect this to be a feeling-sharing party\nbecause the storming Horneater gave you a sour eye? Storm off. It’s a\nmiracle I’m not burning moss every moment of the day, having to deal with\nyou lot.”\nNatam patted him on the shoulder.\n“And I will not fight,” Rock said. “I know some of you do not like this.\nHe makes me feel different. Not only because I am only one with proper\nbeard in crew.” He leaned forward. “Life is changing. We will all feel alone\nbecause of this, yes? Ha! Perhaps we can feel alone together.”\nThey all seemed to find this comforting. Well, except Lopen, who had\nsnuck away from the group and for some reason was lifting up rocks on the\nother side of the plateau and looking underneath them. Even among\nhumans, he was a strange one.\nThe men relaxed and started to chat. Though Hobber slapped Rlain on\nthe back, it was the closest any of them came to asking how he felt. Was it\nchildish of him to feel frustrated? They all thought they were alone, did\nthey? Felt that they were outsiders? Did they know what it was like to be of\nan entirely different species? A species they were currently at war with—a\nspecies whose people had all been either murdered or corrupted?\nPeople in the tower watched him with outright hatred. His friends didn’t,\nbut they sure did like to pat themselves on the back for that fact. We\nunderstand that you’re not like the others, Rlain. You can’t help what you\nlook like.\nHe attuned Annoyance and sat there until Kaladin sent the rest of them\noff to train the aspiring Windrunners. Kaladin spoke softly with Rock, then\nturned and paused, seeing Rlain sitting there on his bucket.\n“Rlain,” Kaladin said, “why don’t you take the rest of the day off?”\nWhat if I don’t want special accommodation because you feel sorry for\nme?\nKaladin squatted down beside Rlain. “Hey. You heard what Rock said. I\nknow how you feel. We can help you shoulder this.”\n“Do you really?” Rlain said. “Do you actually know how I feel, Kaladin\nStormblessed? Or is that simply a thing that men say?”\n“I guess it’s a thing men say,” Kaladin admitted, then pulled over an\nupside-down bucket for himself. “Can you tell me how it feels?”\nDid he really want to know? Rlain considered, then attuned Resolve. “I\ncan try.”\n56. Always with You"

Always with You\nI am also made uncertain by your subterfuge. Why have you not made\nyourself known to me before this? How is it you can hide? Who are you\ntruly, and how do you know so much about Adonalsium?\nDalinar appeared in the courtyard of a strange fortress with a single\ntowering wall of bloodred stones. It closed a large gap in a mountainous\nrock formation.\nAround him, men carried supplies or otherwise made themselves busy,\npassing in and out of buildings constructed against the natural stone walls.\nWinter air made Dalinar’s breath puff before him.\nHe held Navani’s freehand on his left, and Jasnah’s on his right. It had\nworked. His control over these visions was increasing beyond even what the\nStormfather assumed possible. Today, by holding their hands, he had\nbrought Navani and Jasnah in without a highstorm.\n“Wonderful,” Navani said, squeezing his hand. “That wall is as majestic\nas you described. And the people. Bronze weapons again, very little steel.”\n“That armor is Soulcast,” Jasnah said, releasing his hand. “Look at the\nfingermarks on the metal. That’s burnished iron, not true steel, Soulcast\nfrom clay into that shape. I wonder … did access to Soulcasters retard their\ndrive to learn smelting? Working steel is difficult. You can’t simply melt it\nover a fire, like you can bronze.”\n“So…” Dalinar asked, “when are we?”\n“Maybe two thousand years ago,” Jasnah said. “Those are Haravingian\nswords, and see those archways? Late classical architecture, but washed out\nfaux blue on the cloaks, rather than true blue dyes. Mix that with the\nlanguage you spoke in—which my mother recorded last time—and I’m\nfairly certain.” She glanced at the passing soldiers. “A multiethnic coalition\nhere, like during the Desolations—but if I’m right, this is over two thousand\nyears after Aharietiam.”\n“They’re fighting someone,” Dalinar said. “The Radiants retreat from a\nbattle, then abandon their weapons on the field outside.”\n“Which places the Recreance a little more recently than Masha-daughter-\nShaliv had it in her history,” Jasnah said, musing. “From my reading of your\nvision accounts, this is the last chronologically—though it’s difficult to\nplace the one with you overlooking ruined Kholinar.”\n“Who could they be fighting?” Navani asked as men atop the wall raised\nthe alarm. Horsemen galloped out of the keep, off to investigate. “This is\nwell after the Voidbringers left.”\n“It could be the False Desolation,” Jasnah said.\nDalinar and Navani both looked at her.\n“A legend,” Jasnah said. “Considered pseudohistorical. Dovcanti wrote\nan epic about it somewhere around fifteen hundred years ago. The claim is\nthat some Voidbringers survived Aharietiam, and there were many clashes\nwith them afterward. It’s considered unreliable, but that’s because many\nlater ardents insist that no Voidbringers could have survived. I’m inclined to"

It’s considered unreliable, but that’s because many\nlater ardents insist that no Voidbringers could have survived. I’m inclined to\nassume this is a clash with parshmen before they were somehow deprived\nof their ability to change forms.”\nShe looked to Dalinar, eyes alight, and he nodded. She strode off to\ncollect whatever historical tidbits she could.\nNavani took some instruments from her satchel. “One way or another,\nI’m going to figure out where this ‘Feverstone Keep’ is, even if I have to\nbully these people into drawing a map. Perhaps we could send scholars to\nthis location and find clues about the Recreance.”\nDalinar made his way over to the base of the wall. It was a truly majestic\nstructure, typical of the strange contrasts of these visions: a classical people,\nwithout fabrials or even proper metallurgy, accompanied by wonders.\nA group of men piled down the steps from the top of the wall. They were\ntrailed by His Excellency Yanagawn the First, Prime Aqasix of Azir. While\nDalinar had brought Navani and Jasnah by touch, he had asked the\nStormfather to bring in Yanagawn. The highstorm currently raged in Azir.\nThe youth saw Dalinar and stopped. “Do I have to fight today,\nBlackthorn?”\n“Not today, Your Excellency.”\n“I’m getting really tired of these visions,” Yanagawn said, descending\nthe last few steps.\n“That fatigue never leaves, Your Excellency. In fact, it has grown as I’ve\nbegun to grasp the importance of what I have seen in vision, and the burden\nit puts upon me.”\n“That isn’t what I meant by tired.”\nDalinar didn’t reply, hands clasped behind him as together they walked\nto the sally port, where Yanagawn watched events unfold outside. Radiants\nwere crossing the open plain or flying down. They summoned their Blades,\nprovoking concern from the watching soldiers.\nThe knights drove their weapons into the ground, then abandoned them.\nThey left their armor as well. Shards of incalculable value, renounced.\nThe young emperor looked to be in no rush to confront them as Dalinar\nhad been. Dalinar, therefore, took him by the arm and guided him out as the\nfirst soldiers opened the doors. He didn’t want the emperor to get caught in\nthe flood that would soon come, as men dashed for those Blades, then\nstarted killing one another.\nAs before in this vision, Dalinar felt as if he could hear the screaming\ndeaths of the spren, the terrible sorrow of this field. It almost overwhelmed\nhim.\n“Why?” Yanagawn asked. “Why did they just … give up?”\n“We don’t know, Your Excellency. This scene haunts me. There is so\nmuch I don’t understand. Ignorance has become the theme of my rule.”\nYanagawn looked around, then scrambled for a tall boulder to climb,\nwhere he could better watch the Radiants. He seemed far more engaged by\nthis than he had been by other visions. Dalinar could respect that. War was\nwar, but this … this was something you never saw. Men willingly giving up\ntheir Shards?"

It pervaded the air like a terrible stench.\nYanagawn settled down on his boulder. “So why show me this? You\ndon’t even know what it means.”\n“If you’re not going to join my coalition, I figure I should still give you\nas much knowledge as I can. Perhaps we will fall, and you will survive.\nMaybe your scholars can solve these puzzles when we cannot. And maybe\nyou are the leader Roshar needs, while I am just an emissary.”\n“You don’t believe that.”\n“I don’t. I still want you to have these visions, just in case.”\nYanagawn fidgeted, playing with the tassels on his leather breastplate.\n“I … don’t matter as much as you think I do.”\n“Pardon, Your Excellency, but you underestimate your importance.\nAzir’s Oathgate will be vital, and you are the strongest kingdom of the\nwest. With Azir at our side, many other countries will join with us.”\n“I mean,” Yanagawn said, “that I don’t matter. Sure, Azir does. But I’m\nonly a kid they put on the throne because they were afraid that assassin\nwould come back.”\n“And the miracle they’re publishing? The proof from the Heralds that\nyou were chosen?”\n“That was Lift, not me.” Yanagawn looked down at his feet, swinging\nbeneath him. “They’re training me to act important, Kholin, but I’m not.\nNot yet. Maybe not ever.”\nThis was a new face to Yanagawn. The vision today had shaken him, but\nnot in the way Dalinar had hoped. He’s a youth, Dalinar reminded himself.\nLife at his age was challenging anyway, without adding to it the stress of an\nunexpected accession to power.\n“Whatever the reason,” Dalinar told the young emperor, “you are Prime.\nThe viziers have published your miraculous elevation to the public. You do\nhave some measure of authority.”\nHe shrugged. “The viziers aren’t bad people. They feel guilty for putting\nme in this position. They give me education—kind of force it down my\nthroat, honestly—and expect me to participate. But I’m not ruling the\nempire.\n“They’re scared of you. Very scared. More scared than they are of the\nassassin. He burned the emperors’ eyes, but emperors can be replaced. You\nrepresent something far more terrible. They think you could destroy our\nentire culture.”\n“No Alethi has to set foot on Azish stone,” Dalinar said. “But come to\nme, Your Excellency. Tell them you’ve seen visions, that the Heralds want\nyou to at least visit Urithiru. Tell them that the opportunities far outweigh\nthe danger of opening that Oathgate.”\n“And if this happens again?” Yanagawn asked, nodding toward the field\nof Shardblades. Hundreds of them sprouting from the ground, silvery,\nreflecting sunlight. Men were now pouring out of the keep, flooding toward\nthose weapons.\n“We will see that it doesn’t. Somehow.” Dalinar narrowed his eyes. “I"

Somehow.” Dalinar narrowed his eyes. “I\ndon’t know what caused the Recreance, but I can guess. They lost their\nvision, Your Excellency. They became embroiled in politics and let\ndivisions creep among them. They forgot their purpose: protecting Roshar\nfor its people.”\nYanagawn looked to him, frowning. “That’s harsh. You always seemed\nso respectful of the Radiants before.”\n“I respect those who fought in the Desolations. These? I can sympathize.\nI too have on occasion let myself be distracted by small-minded pettiness.\nBut respect? No.” He shivered. “They killed their spren. They betrayed their\noaths! They may not be villains, as history paints them, but in this moment\nthey failed to do what was right and just. They failed Roshar.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled in the distance, agreeing with this sentiment.\nYanagawn cocked his head.\n“What?” Dalinar asked.\n“Lift doesn’t trust you,” he said.\nDalinar glanced about, expecting her to appear as she had in the previous\ntwo visions he’d shown Yanagawn. There was no sign of the young Reshi\ngirl that the Stormfather detested so much.\n“It’s because,” Yanagawn continued, “you act so righteous. She says\nanyone who acts like you do is trying to hide something.”\nA soldier strode up and spoke to Yanagawn in the Almighty’s voice.\n“They are the first.”\nDalinar stepped back, letting the young emperor listen as the Almighty\ngave his short speech for this vision. These events will go down in history.\nThey will be infamous. You will have many names for what happened\nhere …\nThe Almighty said the same words he had to Dalinar.\nThe Night of Sorrows will come, and the True Desolation. The\nEverstorm.\nThe men on the field full of Shards started to fight over the weapons. For\nthe first time in history, men started slaughtering one another with dead\nspren. Finally, Yanagawn faded, vanishing from the vision. Dalinar closed\nhis eyes, feeling the Stormfather draw away. Everything now dissolved …\nExcept it didn’t.\nDalinar opened his eyes. He was still on the field before the looming,\nbloodred wall of Feverstone Keep. Men fought over Shardblades while\nsome voices called for everyone to be patient.\nThose who claimed a Shard this day would become rulers. It bothered\nDalinar that the best men, the ones calling for moderation or raising\nconcerns, would be rare among their numbers. They weren’t aggressive\nenough to seize the advantage.\nWhy was he still here? Last time, the vision had ended before this.\n“Stormfather?” he asked.\nNo reply. Dalinar turned around.\nA man in white and gold stood there.\nDalinar jumped, scrambling backward. The man was old, with a wide,\nfurrowed face and bone-white hair that swept back from his head as if\nblown by wind. Thick mustaches with a hint of black in them blended into a\nshort white beard. He seemed to be Shin, judging by his skin and eyes, and\nhe wore a golden crown in his powdery hair."

God.”\n“Yes,” the man said.\n“Where have you been?” Dalinar said.\n“I’ve always been here,” God said. “Always with you, Dalinar. Oh, I’ve\nwatched you for a long, long time.”\n“Here? You’re … not the Almighty, are you?”\n“Honor? No, he truly is dead, as you’ve been told.” The old man’s smile\ndeepened, genuine and kindly. “I’m the other one, Dalinar. They call me\nOdium.”\n57. Passion\nIf you would speak to me further, I request open honesty. Return to my\nlands, approach my servants, and I will see what I can do for your\nquest.\nOdium.\nDalinar scrambled to his feet, lurching backward and seeking a weapon\nhe didn’t possess.\nOdium. Standing in front of him.\nThe Stormfather had grown distant, almost vanished—but Dalinar could\nsense a faint emotion from him. A whine, like he was straining against\nsomething heavy?\nNo. No, that was a whimper.\nOdium rested his golden scepter against the palm of his hand, then\nturned to regard the men fighting over Shardblades.\n“I remember this day,” Odium said. “Such passion. And such loss.\nTerrible for many, but glorious for others. You are wrong about why the\nRadiants fell, Dalinar. There was infighting among them, true, but no more\nthan in other eras. They were honest men and women, with different views\nat times, but unified in their desire to do what was best.”\n“What do you want of me?” Dalinar said, hand to his breast, breathing\nquickly. Storms. He wasn’t ready.\nCould he ever be ready for this moment?\nOdium strolled over to a small boulder and settled down. He sighed in\nrelief, like a man releasing a heavy burden, then nodded to the space next to\nhim.\nDalinar made no move to sit.\n“You have been placed in a difficult position, my son,” Odium said.\n“You are the first to bond the Stormfather in his current state. Did you know\nthat? You are deeply connected to the remnants of a god.”\n“Whom you killed.”\n“Yes. I’ll kill the other one too, eventually. She’s hidden herself\nsomewhere, and I’m too … shackled.”\n“You’re a monster.”\n“Oh, Dalinar. This from you of all people? Tell me you’ve never found\nyourself in conflict with someone you respect. Tell me you’ve never killed a\nman because you had to, even if—in a better world—he shouldn’t deserve\nit?”\nDalinar bit back a retort. Yes, he’d done that.

You need to hear what he says. Even this creature’s\nlies can tell you more than a world of common truths.\nHe walked over, then stiffly sat down.\n“What do you know of us three?” Odium asked.\n“Honestly, I wasn’t even aware there were three of you.”\n“More, in fact,” Odium said absently. “But only three of relevance to\nyou. Me. Honor. Cultivation. You speak of her, don’t you?”\n“I suppose,” Dalinar said. “Some people identify her with Roshar, the\nspren of the world itself.”\n“She’d like that,” Odium said. “I wish I could simply let her have this\nplace.”\n“So do it. Leave us alone. Go away.”\nOdium turned to him so sharply that Dalinar jumped. “Is that,” Odium\nsaid quietly, “an offer to release me from my bonds, coming from the man\nholding the remnants of Honor’s name and power?”\nDalinar stammered. Idiot. You’re not some raw recruit. Pull yourself\ntogether. “No,” he said firmly.\n“Ah, all right then,” Odium said. He smiled, a twinkle in his eyes. “Oh,\ndon’t fret so. These things must be done properly. I will go if you release\nme, but only if you do it by Intent.”\n“And what are the consequences of my releasing you?”\n“Well, first I’d see to Cultivation’s death. There would be … other\nconsequences, as you call them, as well.”\nEyes burned as men swept about themselves with Shardblades, killing\nothers who had mere moments before been their comrades. It was a frantic,\ninsane brawl for power.\n“And you can’t just … leave?” Dalinar asked. “Without killing anyone?”\n“Well, let me ask you this in return. Why did you seize control of\nAlethkar from poor Elhokar?”\n“I…” Don’t reply. Don’t give him ammunition.\n“You knew it was for the best,” Odium said. “You knew that Elhokar\nwas weak, and the kingdom would suffer without firm leadership. You took\ncontrol for the greater good, and it has served Roshar well.”\nNearby, a man stumbled toward them, limping out of the fray. His eyes\nburned as a Shardblade rammed through his back, protruding three feet out\nof his chest. He fell forward, eyes trailing twin lines of smoke.\n“A man cannot serve two gods at once, Dalinar,” Odium said. “And so, I\ncannot leave her behind. In fact, I cannot leave behind the Splinters of\nHonor, as I once thought I could. I can already see that going wrong. Once\nyou release me, my transformation of this realm will be substantial.”\n“You think you’ll do better?” Dalinar wet his mouth, which had gone\ndry. “Do better than others would, for this land? You, a manifestation of\nhatred and pain?”\n“They call me Odium,” the old man said. “A good enough name. It does\nhave a certain bite to it. But the word is too limiting to describe me, and you"

But the word is too limiting to describe me, and you\nshould know that it is not all I represent.”\n“Which is?”\nHe looked to Dalinar. “Passion, Dalinar Kholin. I am emotion incarnate.\nI am the soul of the spren and of men. I am lust, joy, hatred, anger, and\nexultation. I am glory and I am vice. I am the very thing that makes men\nmen.\n“Honor cared only for bonds. Not the meaning of bonds and oaths,\nmerely that they were kept. Cultivation only wants to see transformation.\nGrowth. It can be good or bad, for all she cares. The pain of men is nothing\nto her. Only I understand it. Only I care, Dalinar.”\nI don’t believe that, Dalinar thought. I can’t believe that.\nThe old man sighed, then heaved himself to his feet. “If you could see\nthe result of Honor’s influence, you would not be so quick to name me a\ngod of anger. Separate the emotion from men, and you have creatures like\nNale and his Skybreakers. That is what Honor would have given you.”\nDalinar nodded toward the terrible fray on the field before them. “You\nsaid I was wrong about what caused the Radiants to abandon their oaths.\nWhat was it really?”\nOdium smiled. “Passion, son. Glorious, wondrous passion. Emotion. It is\nwhat defines men—though ironically you are poor vessels for it. It fills you\nup and breaks you, unless you find someone to share the burden.” He\nlooked toward the dying men. “But can you imagine a world without it? No.\nNot one I’d want to live in. Ask that of Cultivation, next time you see her.\nAsk what she’d want for Roshar. I think you’ll find me to be the better\nchoice.”\n“Next time?” Dalinar said. “I’ve never seen her.”\n“Of course you have,” Odium said, turning and walking away. “She\nsimply robbed you of that memory. Her touch is not how I would have\nhelped you. It stole a part of you away, and left you like a blind man who\ncan’t remember that he once had sight.”\nDalinar stood up. “I offer you a challenge of champions. With terms to\nbe discussed. Will you accept it?”\nOdium stopped, then turned slowly. “Do you speak for the world,\nDalinar Kholin? Will you offer this for all Roshar?”\nStorms. Would he? “I…”\n“Either way, I don’t accept.” Odium stood taller, smiling in an\nunnervingly understanding way. “I need not take on such a risk, for I know,\nDalinar Kholin, that you will make the right decision. You will free me.”\n“No.” Dalinar stood. “You shouldn’t have revealed yourself, Odium. I\nonce feared you, but it is easier to fear what you don’t understand.

Dalinar found himself standing on a speck\nof nothingness that was the entire world, looking up at an eternal, all-\nembracing flame. It stretched in every direction, starting as red, moving to\norange, then changing to blazing white.\nThen somehow, the flames seemed to burn into a deep blackness, violet\nand angry.\nThis was something so terrible that it consumed light itself. It was hot. A\nradiance indescribable, intense heat and black fire, colored violet at the\noutside.\nBurning.\nOverwhelming.\nPower.\nIt was the scream of a thousand warriors on the battlefield.\nIt was the moment of most sensual touch and ecstasy.\nIt was the sorrow of loss, the joy of victory.\nAnd it was hatred. Deep, pulsing hatred with a pressure to turn all things\nmolten. It was the heat of a thousand suns, it was the bliss of every kiss, it\nwas the lives of all men wrapped up in one, defined by everything they felt.\nEven taking in the smallest fraction of it terrified Dalinar. It left him tiny\nand frail. He knew if he drank of that raw, concentrated, liquid black fire,\nhe’d be nothing in a moment. The entire planet of Roshar would puff away,\nno more consequential than the curling smoke of a snuffed-out candle.\nIt faded, and Dalinar found himself lying on the rock outside Feverstone\nKeep, staring upward. Above him, the sun seemed dim and cold. Everything\nfelt frozen by contrast.\nOdium knelt down beside him, then helped him rise to a seated position.\n“There, there. That was a smidge too much, wasn’t it? I had forgotten how\noverwhelming that could be. Here, take a drink.” He handed Dalinar a\nwaterskin.\nDalinar looked at it, baffled, then up at the old man. In Odium’s eyes, he\ncould see that violet-black fire. Deep, deep within. The figure with whom\nDalinar spoke was not the god, it was merely a face, a mask.\nBecause if Dalinar had to confront the true force behind those smiling\neyes, he would go mad.\nOdium patted him on the shoulder. “Take a minute, Dalinar. I’ll leave\nyou here. Relax. It—” He cut off, then frowned, spinning. He searched the\nrocks.\n“What?” Dalinar asked.\n“Nothing. Just an old man’s mind playing tricks on him.” He patted\nDalinar on the arm. “We’ll speak again, I promise.”\nHe vanished in an eyeblink.\nDalinar collapsed backward, completely drained. Storms. Just …\nStorms.\n“That guy,” a girl’s voice said, “is creepy.”\nDalinar shifted, sitting up with difficulty. A head popped up from behind\nsome nearby rocks. Tan skin, pale eyes, long dark hair, lean, girlish features.\n“I mean, old men are all creepy,” Lift said. “Seriously. All wrinkly and\n‘Hey, want some sweets?’ and ‘Oh, listen to this boring story.’ I’m on to\nthem. They can act nice all they want, but nobody gets old without ruining a\nwhole buncha lives.”"

Colorful patterns on robes, a\nthick overcoat and cap. “Even as old people go, that one was extra creepy,”\nshe said softly. “What was that thing, tight-butt? Didn’t smell like a real\nperson.”\n“They call it Odium,” Dalinar said, exhausted. “And it is what we fight.”\n“Huh.

Kaza\nThe ship First Dreams crashed through a wave, prompting Kaza to cling\ntightly to the rigging. Her gloved hands already ached, and she was certain\neach new wave would toss her overboard.\nShe refused to go down below. This was her destiny. She was not a thing\nto be carted from place to place, not any longer. Besides, that dark sky—\nsuddenly stormy, even though the sailing had been easy up until an hour ago\n—was no more disconcerting than her visions.\nAnother wave sent water crashing across the deck. Sailors scrambled and\nscreamed, mostly hirelings out of Steen, as no rational crew would make\nthis trip. Captain Vazrmeb stalked among them, shouting orders, while Droz\n—the helmsman—kept them on a steady heading. Into the storm. Straight.\nInto. The storm.\nKaza held tight, feeling her age as her arms started to weaken. Icy water\nwashed over her, pushing back the hood of her robe, exposing her face—\nand its twisted nature. Most sailors weren’t paying attention, though her cry\ndid bring Vazrmeb’s attention.\nThe only Thaylen on board, the captain didn’t much match her image of\nthe people. Thaylens, to her, were portly little men in vests—merchants\nwith styled hair who haggled for every last sphere. Vazrmeb, however, was\nas tall as an Alethi, with hands wide enough to palm boulders and forearms\nlarge enough to lift them.\nOver the crashing of waves, he yelled, “Someone get that Soulcaster\nbelow deck!”\n“No,” she shouted back at him. “I stay.”\n“I didn’t pay a prince’s ransom to bring you,” he said, stalking up to her,"

Storms! Kaza’s\nstomach practically squeezed up into her throat, and she felt her fingers\nsliding on the ropes.\nVazrmeb seized her by the side of her robe, holding her tight as they\nplunged into the water beyond the wave. For a brief terrifying moment, they\nseemed entombed in the chill water. As if the entire ship had sunk.\nThe wave passed, and Kaza found herself lying in a sodden heap on the\ndeck, held by the captain. “Storming fool,” he said to her. “You’re my secret\nweapon. You drown yourself when you’re not in my pay, understand?”\nShe nodded limply. And then realized, with a shock, she’d been able to\nhear him easily. The storm …\nWas gone?\nVazrmeb stood up straight, grinning broadly, his white eyebrows combed\nback into his long mane of dripping hair. All across the deck, the sailors\nwho had survived were climbing to their feet, sopping wet and staring at the\nsky. It maintained its overcast gloom—but the winds had fallen completely\nstill.\nVazrmeb bellowed out a laugh, sweeping back his long, curling hair.\n“What did I tell you, men! That new storm came from Aimia! Now it has\ngone and escaped, leaving the riches of its homeland to be plundered!”\nEveryone knew you didn’t linger around Aimia, though everyone had\ndifferent explanations why. Some rumors told of a vengeful storm here, one\nthat sought out and destroyed approaching ships. The strange wind they’d\nencountered—which didn’t match the timing of highstorm or Everstorm—\nseemed to support that.\nThe captain started shouting orders, getting the men back into position.\nThey hadn’t been sailing long, only a short distance out of Liafor, along the\nShin coast, then westward toward this northern section of Aimia. They’d\nsoon spotted the large main island, but had not visited it. Everyone knew\nthat was barren, lifeless. The treasures were on the hidden islands,\nsupposedly lying in wait to enrich those willing to brave the winds and\ntreacherous straits.\nShe cared less for that—what were riches to her? She had come because\nof another rumor, one spoken of only among her kind. Perhaps here, at last,\nshe could find a cure for her condition.\nEven as she righted herself, she felt in her pouch, seeking the comforting\ntouch of her Soulcaster. Hers, no matter what the rulers of Liafor claimed.\nHad they spent their youths caressing it, learning its secrets?

She’d\nentered the stage where her … disfigurements were starkly obvious.\nKaza was, slowly, becoming smoke.\nVazrmeb took the helm himself, giving Droz a break. The lanky man\nstepped down from the poop deck, noting her by the side of the ship. He\ngrinned at her, which she found curious. She hadn’t ever spoken to him.\nNow he sauntered over, as if intending to make small talk.\n“So…” he said. “Up on deck? Through that? You’ve got guts.”\nShe hesitated, considering this strange creature, then lowered her hood.\nHe didn’t flinch, even though her hair, her ears, and now parts of her face\nwere disintegrating. There was a hole in her cheek through which you could\nsee her jaw and teeth. Lines of smoke rimmed the hole; the flesh seemed to\nbe burning away. Air passed through it when she spoke, altering her voice,\nand she had to tip her head all the way back to drink anything. Even then, it\ndribbled out.\nThe process was slow. She had a few years left until the Soulcasting\nkilled her.\nDroz seemed intent on pretending nothing was wrong. “I can’t believe\nwe got through that storm. You think it hunts ships, like the stories say?”\nHe was Liaforan like herself, with deep brown skin and dark brown eyes.\nWhat did he want? She tried to remember the ordinary passions of human\nlife, which she’d begun to forget. “Is it sex you want?… No, you are much\nyounger than I am. Hmmm…” Curious. “Are you frightened, and wishing\nfor comfort?”\nHe started to fidget, playing with the end of a tied-off rope. “Um … So, I\nmean, the prince sent you, right?”\n“Ah.” So he knew that she was the prince’s cousin. “You wish to connect\nyourself to royalty. Well, I came on my own.”\n“Surely he let you go.”\n“Of course he didn’t. If not for my safety, then for that of my device.” It\nwas hers. She looked off across the too-still ocean. “They locked me up\neach day, gave me comforts they assumed would keep me happy. They\nrealized that at any moment, I could literally make walls and bonds turn to\nsmoke.”\n“Does … does it hurt?”\n“It is blissful. I slowly connect to the device, and through it to Roshar.\nUntil the day it will take me fully into its embrace.” She lifted a hand and\npulled her black glove off, one finger at a time, revealing a hand that was\ndisintegrating. Five lines of darkness, one rising from the tip of each finger.\nShe turned it, palm toward him. “I could show you. Feel my touch, and you\ncan know. One moment, and then you will mingle with the air itself.”\nHe fled. Excellent.\nThe captain steered them toward a small island, poking from the placid\nocean right where the captain’s map had claimed it would be. It had dozens\nof names. The Rock of Secrets. The Void’s Playground. So melodramatic."

        "text": "ocean right where the captain’s map had claimed it would be. It had dozens\nof names. The Rock of Secrets. The Void’s Playground. So melodramatic.\nShe preferred the old name for the place: Akinah.\nSupposedly, there had once been a grand city here. But who would put a\ncity on an island you couldn’t approach? For, jutting from the ocean here\nwere a set of strange rock formations. They ringed the entire island like a\nwall, each some forty feet tall, resembling spearheads. As the ship drew\ncloser, the sea grew choppy again, and she felt a bout of nausea. She liked\nthat. It was a human feeling.\nHer hand again sought her Soulcaster.\nThat nausea mixed with a faint sense of hunger. Food was something she\noften forgot about these days, as her body needed less of it now. Chewing\nwas annoying, with the hole in her cheek. Still, she liked the scents from\nwhatever the cook was stirring up below. Perhaps the meal would calm the\nmen, who seemed agitated about approaching the island.\nKaza moved to the poop deck, near the captain.\n“Now you earn your keep, Soulcaster,” he said. “And I’m justified in\nhauling you all the way out here.”\n“I’m not a thing,” she said absently, “to be used. I am a person. Those\nspikes of stone … they were Soulcast there.” The enormous stone\nspearheads were too even in a ring about the island. Judging by the currents\nahead, some lurked beneath the waters as well, to rip up the hulls of\napproaching vessels.\n“Can you destroy one?” the captain asked her.\n“No. They are much larger than you indicated.”\n“But—”\n“I can make a hole in them, Captain. It is easier to Soulcast an entire\nobject, but I am no ordinary Soulcaster. I have begun to see the dark sky\nand the second sun, the creatures that lurk, hidden, around the cities of\nmen.”\nHe shivered visibly. Why should that have frightened him? She’d merely\nstated facts.\n“We need you to transform the tips of a few under the waves,” he said.\n“Then make a hole at least large enough for the dinghies to get in to the\nisland beyond.”\n“I will keep my word, but you must remember. I do not serve you. I am\nhere for my own purposes.”\nThey dropped anchor as close to the spikes as they dared get. The spikes\nwere even more daunting—and more obviously Soulcast—from here. Each\nwould have required several Soulcasters in concert, she thought, standing at\nthe prow of the ship as the men ate a hasty meal of stew.\nThe cook was a woman, Reshi from the looks of her, with tattoos all\nacross her face. She pushed the captain to eat, claiming that if he went in\nhungry, he’d be distracted. Even Kaza took some, though her tongue no\nlonger tasted food. It all felt like the same mush to her, and she ate with a\nnapkin pressed to her cheek.\nThe captain drew anticipationspren as he waited—ribbons that waved in\nthe wind—and Kaza could see the beasts beyond, the creatures that\naccompanied the spren.\nThe ship’s four dinghies were cramped, with rowers and officers all"

She pulled up her\nhood, which still hadn’t dried, and sat on her bench. What had the captain\nbeen planning to do if the storm hadn’t stopped? Would he seriously have\ntried to use her and a dinghy to remove these spears in the middle of a\ntempest?\nThey reached the first spike, and Kaza carefully unwrapped her\nSoulcaster, releasing a flood of light. Three large gemstones connected by\nchains, with loops for her fingers. She put it on, with the gemstones on the\nback of her hand. She sighed softly to feel the metal against her skin again.\nWarm, welcoming, a part of her.\nShe reached over the side into the chill water and pressed her hand\nagainst the tip of the stone spear—smoothed from years in the ocean. Light\nfrom the gemstones lit the water, reflections dancing across her robe.\nShe closed her eyes, and felt the familiar sensation of being drawn into\nthe other world. Of another will reinforcing her own, something\ncommanding and powerful, attracted by her request for aid.\nThe stone did not wish to change. It was content with its long slumber in\nthe ocean. But … yes, yes, it remembered. It had once been air, until\nsomeone had locked it into this shape. She could not make it air again; her\nSoulcaster had only one mode, not the full three. She did not know why.\nSmoke, she whispered to the stone. Freedom in the air. Remember? She\ntempted it, picking at its memories of dancing free.\nYes … freedom.\nShe nearly gave in herself. How wonderful would it be to no longer fear?\nTo soar into infinity on the air? To be free of mortal pains?\nThe tip of the stone burst into smoke, sending an explosion of bubbles up\naround the dinghy. Kaza was shocked back into the real world, and a piece\ndeep within her trembled. Terrified. She’d almost gone that time.\nSmoke bubbles rattled the dinghy, which nearly upended. She should\nhave warned them. Sailors muttered, but in the next dinghy over, the captain\npraised her.\nShe removed two more spear tips beneath the waves before finally\nreaching the wall. Here, the spearheadlike formations had been grown so\nclose together, there was barely a handspan gap between them. It took three\ntries to get the dinghy close enough—as soon as they got into position,\nsome turning of the waves would pull them away again.\nFinally, the sailors managed to keep the dinghy steady. Kaza reached out\nwith the Soulcaster—two of the three gems were almost out of Stormlight,\nand glowed only faintly. She should have enough.\nShe pressed her hand against the spike, then convinced it to become\nsmoke. It was … easy this time. She felt the explosion of wind from the\ntransformation, her soul crying in delight at the smoke, thick and sweet. She\nbreathed it in through the hole in her cheek while sailors coughed. She\nlooked up at the smoke, drifting away. How wonderful it would be to join\nit.…\nNo."

How wonderful it would be to join\nit.…\nNo.\nThe island proper loomed beyond that hole. Dark, like its stones had\nbeen stained by smoke themselves, it had tall rock formations along its\ncenter. They looked almost like the walls of a city.\nThe captain’s dinghy pulled up to hers, and the captain transferred to her\nboat. His began to row backward.\n“What?” she asked. “Why is your boat heading back?”\n“They claim to not be feeling well,” the captain said. Was he abnormally\npale? “Cowards. They won’t have any of the prize, then.”\n“Gemstones lay around just for the plucking here,” Droz added.\n“Generations of greatshells have died here, leaving their hearts. We’re\ngoing to be rich, rich men.”\nAs long as the secret was here.\nShe settled into her place at the prow of the boat as the sailors guided the\nthree dinghies through the gap. The Aimians had known about Soulcasters.\nThis was where you’d come to get the devices, in the old days. You’d come\nto the ancient island of Akinah.\nIf there was a secret of how to avoid death by the device she loved, she\nwould find it here.\nHer stomach began acting up again as they rowed. Kaza endured it,\nthough she felt as if she were slipping into the other world. That wasn’t an\nocean beneath her, but deep black glass. And two suns in the sky, one that\ndrew her soul toward it. Her shadow, to stretch out in the wrong\ndirection …\nSplash.\nShe started. One of the sailors had slipped from his boat into the water.\nShe gaped as another slumped to the side, oar falling from his fingers.\n“Captain?” She turned to find him with drooping eyes. He went limp,\nthen fell backward, unconscious, knocking his head against the back seat of\nthe boat.\nThe rest of the sailors weren’t doing any better. The other two dinghies\nhad begun to drift aimlessly. Not a single sailor seemed to be conscious.\nMy destiny, Kaza thought. My choice.\nNot a thing to be carted from place to place, and ordered to Soulcast. Not\na tool. A person.\nShe shoved aside an unconscious sailor and took the oars herself. It was\ndifficult work. She was unaccustomed to physical labor, and her fingers had\ntrouble gripping. They’d started to dissolve further. Perhaps a year or two\nfor her survival was optimistic.\nStill, she rowed. She fought the waters until she at long last got close\nenough to hop out into the water and feel rock beneath her feet. Her robes\nbillowing up around her, she finally thought to check if Vazrmeb was alive.\nNone of the sailors in her dinghy were breathing, so she let the boat slip\nbackward on the waves. Alone, Kaza fought through the surf and—finally—\non hands and knees, crawled up onto the stones of the island.\nThere, she collapsed, drowsy. Why was she so sleepy?\nShe awoke to a small cremling scuttling across the rocks near her. It had\na strange shape, with large wings and a head that made it look like an"

Its carapace shimmered with dozens of colors.\nKaza could remember a time when she’d collected cremlings, pinning\nthem to boards and proclaiming she’d become a natural historian. What had\nhappened to that girl?\nShe was transformed by necessity. Given the Soulcaster, which was\nalways to be kept in the royal family. Given a charge.\nAnd a death sentence.\nShe stirred, and the cremling scrambled away. She coughed, then began\nto crawl toward those rock formations. That city? Dark city of stone? She\ncould barely think, though she did notice a gemstone as she passed it—a\nlarge uncut gemheart among the bleached white carapace leftovers of a dead\ngreatshell. Vazrmeb had been right.\nShe collapsed again near the perimeter of the rock formations. They\nlooked like large, ornate buildings, crusted with crem.\n“Ah…” a voice said from behind her. “I should have guessed the drug\nwould not affect you as quickly. You are barely human anymore.”\nKaza rolled over and found someone approaching on quiet, bare feet.\nThe cook? Yes, that was her, with the tattooed face.\n“You…” Kaza croaked, “you poisoned us.”\n“After many warnings not to come to this place,” the cook said. “It is\nrare I must guard it so … aggressively. Men must not again discover this\nplace.”\n“The gemstones?” Kaza asked, growing more drowsy. “Or … is it\nsomething else … something … more…”\n“I cannot speak,” the cook said, “even to sate a dying demand. There are\nthose who could pull secrets from your soul, and the cost would be the ends\nof worlds. Sleep now, Soulcaster. This is the most merciful end I could\ngive.”\nThe cook began to hum. Pieces of her broke off. She crumbled to a pile\nof chittering little cremlings that moved out of her clothing, leaving it in a\nheap.\nA hallucination? Kaza wondered as she drifted.\nShe was dying. Well, that was nothing new.\nThe cremlings began to pick at her hand, taking off her Soulcaster.

Let’s not waste this,\nDukar.”\n“You still must—”\n“Yes, yes. Prove myself not an idiot. The one day I’m not drooling and\nlying in my own waste, you tax my time with this idiocy.”\n“You set—”\n“It up. Yes, the irony is that you let the prohibitions instituted by my\nidiot self control my true self when it finally has opportunity to emerge.”\n“You weren’t an idiot when you—”\n“Here,” Taravangian said, proffering the sheet of math problems to him.\n“Done.”\n“All but the last on this sheet,” Dukar said, taking it in cautious fingers.\n“Do you want to try that one, or…”\n“No need. I know I can’t solve it; too bad. Make quick with the requisite\nformalities. I have work to do.”\nAdrotagia had entered with Malata, the Dustbringer; they were growing\nin companionship as Adrotagia attempted to secure an emotional bond with\nthis lesser Diagram member who had suddenly been thrust into its upper\nechelons, an event predicted by the Diagram—which explained that the\nDustbringers would be the Radiants most likely to accept their cause, and at\nthat Taravangian felt proud, for actually locating one of their number who\ncould bond a spren had not, by any means, been an assured\naccomplishment.\n“He’s smart,” Dukar said to Mrall.

A copy of the\nDiagram. Excellent. “Measure the available gardening area of the stone\nfield outside our balcony and report it to me.”\nHe carried the Diagram into the room, and then shut himself into blissful\nself-company, in which he arranged a diamond in each corner—a light to\naccompany that of his own spark, which shone in truth where others could\nnot venture—and as he finished, a small choir of children started to sing\nVorin hymns outside the room per his request.\nHe breathed in, out, bathed in light and encouraged by song, his hands to\nthe sides; capable of anything, he was consumed by the satisfaction of his\nown working mind, unclogged and flowing freely for the first time in what\nseemed like ages.\nHe opened the Diagram. In it, Taravangian finally faced something\ngreater than himself: a different version of himself.\nThe Diagram—which was the name for this book and for the\norganization that studied it—had not originally been written merely on\npaper, for on that day of majestic capacity, Taravangian had annexed every\nsurface to hold his genius—from the cabinetry to the walls—and while so\ndoing had invented new languages to better express ideas that had to be\nrecorded, by necessity, in a medium less perfect than his thoughts. Even as\nthe intellect he was today, the sight of that writing enforced humility; he\nleafed through pages packed with tiny scrawls, copied—spots, scratches,\nand all—from the original Diagram room, created during what felt like a\ndifferent lifetime, as alien to him now as was the drooling idiot he\nsometimes became.\nMore alien. Everyone understood stupidity.\nHe knelt on the stones, ignoring his aches of body, reverently leafing\nthrough the pages. Then he slipped out his belt knife, and began to cut it up.\nThe Diagram had not been written on paper, and interacting with its\ntranscription bound into codex form must necessarily have influenced their\nthinking, so to obtain true perspective—he now decided—he needed the\nflexibility of seeing the pieces, then arranging them in new ways, for his\nthoughts had not been locked down on that day and he should not perceive\nthem as such today.\nHe was not as brilliant as he’d been on that day, but he didn’t need to be.\nThat day, he’d been God. Today, he could be God’s prophet.\nHe arranged the cut-out pages, and found numerous new connections\nsimply by how the sheets were placed next to each other—indeed, this page\nhere actually connected to this page here … yes.

Ideas he’d\nmissed before seemed to rise from the pages like spren.\nTaravangian did not believe in any religion, for they were unwieldy\nthings, designed to fill gaps in human understanding with nonsensical\nexplanations, allowing people to sleep well at night, granting them a false\nsense of comfort and control and preventing them from stretching further\nfor true understanding, yet there was something strangely holy about the\nDiagram, the power of raw intelligence, the only thing man should worship,\nand oh how little most understood it—oh, how little they deserved it—in\nhandling purity while corrupting it with flawed understanding and silly\nsuperstitions. Was there a way he could prevent any but the most intelligent\nfrom learning to read? That would accomplish so much good; it seemed\ninsane that nobody had implemented such a ban, for while Vorinism forbade\nmen to read, that merely prevented an arbitrary half of the population from\nhandling information, when it was the stupid who should be barred.\nHe paced in the room, then noted a scrap of paper under the door; it\ncontained the answer to his question about the size of the farming platform.\nHe looked over the calculations, listening with half an ear to voices outside,\nalmost overwhelmed by the singing children.\n“Uscritic,” Adrotagia said, “seems to refer to Uscri, a figure from a tragic\npoem written seventeen hundred years ago. She drowned herself after\nhearing her lover had died, though the truth was that he’d not died at all,\nand she misunderstood the report about him.”\n“All right…” Mrall said.\n“She was used in following centuries as an example of acting without\ninformation, though the term eventually came to simply mean ‘stupid.’ The\nsalt seems to refer to the fact that she drowned herself in the sea.”\n“So it was an insult?” Mrall asked.\n“Using an obscure literary reference. Yes.” He could almost hear\nAdrotagia’s sigh. Best to interrupt her before she thought on this further.\nTaravangian flung open the door. “Gum paste for sticking paper to this\nwall. Fetch it for me, Adrotagia.”\nThey’d put paper in a stack by the door without being asked, which\nsurprised him, as they usually had to be ordered to do everything. He closed\nthe door, then knelt and did some calculations relating to the size of the\ntower city. Hmmmm …\nIt provided a fine distraction, but he was soon drawn back to the true\nwork, interrupted only by the arrival of his gum paste, which he used to\nbegin sticking fragments of the Diagram to his walls.\nThis, he thought, arranging pages with numbers interspersing the text,\npages they’d never been able to make sense of. It’s a list of what? Not code,\nlike the other numbers. Unless … could this be shorthand for words?\nYes … yes, he’d been too impatient to write the actual words. He’d\nnumbered them in his head—alphabetically perhaps—so he could write\nquickly.

It had been written\nin meter, as a poem, and presaged that Dalinar would attempt to unite the\nworld.\nSo if he looked to the second contingency …\nTaravangian wrote furiously, seeing words instead of numbers, and—full\nof energy—for a time he forgot his age, his aches, the way his fingers\ntrembled—sometimes—even when he wasn’t so excited.\nThe Diagram hadn’t seen the effect the second son, Renarin, would have\n—he was a completely wild element. Taravangian finished his notations,\nproud, and wandered toward the door, which he opened without looking up.\n“Get me a copy of the surgeon’s words upon my birth,” he said to those\noutside. “Oh, and kill those children.”\nThe music trailed off as the children heard what he’d said. Musicspren\nflitted away.\n“You mean, quiet them from singing,” Mrall said.\n“Whatever. I’m perturbed by the Vorin hymns as a reminder of historic\nreligious oppression of ideas and thought.”\nTaravangian returned to his work, but a short time later a knock came at\nthe door. He flung it open. “I was not to be—”\n“Interrupted,” Adrotagia said, proffering him a sheet of paper. “The\nsurgeon’s words you requested. We keep them handy now, considering how\noften you ask for them.”\n“Fine.”\n“We need to talk, Vargo.”\n“No we—”\nShe walked in anyway, then stopped, inspecting the cut-up pieces of the\nDiagram. Her eyes widened as she turned about. “Are you…”\n“No,” he said. “I haven’t become him again. But I am me, for the first\ntime in weeks.”\n“This isn’t you. This is the monster you sometimes become.”\n“I am not smart enough to be in the dangerous zone.” The zone where,\nannoyingly, they claimed he was too smart to be allowed to make decisions.\nAs if intelligence were somehow a liability!\nShe unfolded a piece of paper from the pocket of her skirt. “Yes, your\ndaily test. You stopped on this page, claiming you couldn’t answer the next\nquestion.”\nDamnation. She’d seen it.\n“If you’d answered,” she said, “it would have proved you were\nintelligent enough to be dangerous. Instead, you decided you couldn’t\nmanage. A loophole we should have considered. You knew that if you\nfinished the question, we’d restrict your decision-making for the day.”\n“Do you know about Stormlight growth?” he said, brushing past her and\ntaking one of the pages he’d written earlier.\n“Vargo…”"

Have\nyou read Golombi?”\n“Of course I have, and you know it,” she said. “You think they enhanced\nthe growth by use of Stormlight-infused gemstones, providing light to\ndarkened places?”\n“Nothing else makes sense, does it?”\n“The tests are inconclusive,” she said. “Yes, spherelight inspires growth\nin a dark room, when candlelight cannot, but Golombi says that the results\nmay have been compromised, and the efficiency is … Oh, bah! That’s a\ndistraction, Vargo. We were discussing what you’ve done to circumvent the\nrules you yourself set out!”\n“When I was stupid.”\n“When you were normal.”\n“Normal is stupid, Adro.” He took her by the shoulders and firmly\npushed her from the room. “I won’t make policy decisions, and I’ll avoid\nordering the murder of any further groups of melodic children. Fine? All\nright? Now leave me alone. You’re stinking up the place with an air of\ncontented idiocy.”\nHe shut the door, and—deep down—felt a glimmer of shame. Had he\ncalled Adrotagia, of all people, an idiot?\nWell. Nothing to do about it now. She would understand.\nHe set to work again, cutting out more of the Diagram, arranging it,\nsearching for any mentions of the Blackthorn, as there was too much in the\nbook to study today, and he had to be focused on their current problem.\nDalinar lived. He was building a coalition. So what did Taravangian do\nnow? Another assassin?\nWhat is the secret? he thought, holding up sheets from the Diagram,\nfinding one where he could see the words on the other side through the\npaper. Could that have been intentional? What should I do? Please. Show\nme the way.\nHe scribbled words on a page. Light. Intelligence. Meaning. He hung\nthem on the wall to inspire him, but he couldn’t help reading the surgeon’s\nwords—the words of a master healer who had delivered Taravangian\nthrough a cut in his mother’s belly.\nHe had the cord wrapped around his neck, the surgeon had said. The\nqueen will know the best course, but I regret to inform her that while he\nlives, your son may have diminished capacity. Perhaps this is one to keep\non outer estates, in favor of other heirs.\nThe “diminished capacity” hadn’t appeared, but the reputation had\nchased Taravangian from childhood, so pervasive in people’s minds that not\na one had seen through his recent act of stupidity, which they’d attributed to"

Or maybe, some said, that was the way he’d\nalways been.\nHe’d overcome that reputation in magnificent ways. Now he’d save the\nworld. Well, the part of the world that mattered.\nHe worked for hours, pinning up more portions of the Diagram, then\nscribbling on them as connections came to him, using beauty and light to\nchase away the shadows of dullness and ignorance, giving him answers—\nthey were here, he merely needed to interpret them.\nHis maid finally interrupted him; the annoying woman was always\nbustling around, trying to make him do this or that, as if he didn’t have\nmore important concerns than soaking his feet.\n“Idiot woman!” he shouted.\nShe didn’t flinch, but walked forward and put a tray of food down beside\nhim.\n“Can’t you see that my work here is important?” he demanded. “I\nhaven’t time for food.”\nShe set out drink for him, then, infuriatingly, patted him on the shoulder.\nAs she left, he noticed Adrotagia and Mrall standing right outside.\n“I don’t suppose,” he said to Mrall, “you’d execute that maid if I\ndemanded it?”\n“We have decided,” the bodyguard said, “that you are not allowed to\nmake such decisions today.”\n“To Damnation with you then. I almost have the answers anyway. We\nmust not assassinate Dalinar Kholin. The time has passed for that. Instead,\nwe must support his coalition. Then we force him to step down, so that I\ncan take his place at the head of the monarchs.”\nAdrotagia walked in and inspected his work. “I doubt Dalinar will\nsimply give leadership of the coalition to you.”\nTaravangian rapped on a set of pages stuck to the wall. “Look here. It\nshould be clear, even to you. I foresaw this.”\n“You’ve made changes,” Mrall said, aghast. “To the Diagram.”\n“Only little ones,” Taravangian said. “Look, see the original writing\nhere? I didn’t change that, and it’s clear. Our task now is to make Dalinar\nwithdraw from leadership, take his place.”\n“We don’t kill him?” Mrall asked.\nTaravangian eyed him, then turned and waved toward the other wall,\nwith even more papers stuck to it. “Killing him now would only raise\nsuspicion.”\n“Yes,” Adrotagia said, “I see this interpretation of the headboard—we\nmust push the Blackthorn so hard that he collapses. But we’ll need secrets\nto use against him.”\n“Easy,” Taravangian said, pushing her toward another set of notations on\nthe wall. “We send that Dustbringer’s spren to spy. Dalinar Kholin reeks of\nsecrets. We can break him, and I can take his place—as the coalition will\nsee me as nonthreatening—whereupon we’ll be in a position of power to\nnegotiate with Odium—who will, by laws of spren and gods, be bound by\nthe agreement made.”"

Taravangian rolled his eyes, but Adrotagia—more\nsentimental than he was—turned and explained. “The Diagram is clear,\nMrall,” she said. “This is the purpose of its creation. We cannot beat the\nenemy; so instead, we save whatever we can.”\n“The only way,” Taravangian agreed. Dalinar would never accept this\nfact. Only one man would be strong enough to make that sacrifice.\nTaravangian felt a glimmer of … something. Memory.\nGive me the capacity to save us.\n“Take this,” he said to Adrotagia, pulling down a sheet he’d annotated.\n“This will work.”\nShe nodded, towing Mrall from the room as Taravangian knelt before the\nbroken, ripped, sliced-up remnants of the Diagram.\nLight and truth. Save what he could.\nAbandon the rest.\nThankfully, he had been given that capacity.\nI-6. This One Is Mine\nVenli was determined to live worthy of power.\nShe presented herself with the others, a small group selected from the\nremaining listeners, and braced for the oncoming storm.\nShe didn’t know if Ulim—or his phantom masters, the ancient listener\ngods—could read her mind. But if they could, they’d find that she was\nloyal.\nThis was war, and Venli among its vanguard. She had discovered the first\nVoidspren. She had discovered stormform. She had redeemed her people.\nShe was blessed.\nToday would prove it. Nine of them had been selected from among the\ntwo thousand listener survivors, Venli included. Demid stood beside her\nwith a wide grin on his face. He loved to learn new things, and the storm\nwas another adventure. They’d been promised something great.\nSee, Eshonai? Venli thought. See what we can do, if you don’t hold us\nback?\n“All right, yes, that’s it,” Ulim said, rippling across the ground as vibrant\nred energy. “Good, good. All in a line. Keep facing west.”\n“Should we seek for cover before the storm, Envoy?” Melu asked to the\nRhythm of Agony. “Or carry shields?”\nUlim took the form of a small person before them. “Don’t be silly. This\nis our storm. You have nothing to fear.”\n“And it will bring us power,” Venli said. “Power beyond even that of\nstormform?”\n“Great power,” Ulim said. “You’ve been chosen. You’re special. But you\nmust embrace this. Welcome it. You have to want it, or the powers will not\nbe able to take a place in your gemhearts.”\nVenli had suffered so much, but this was her reward.

A tiny\nvillage in the near distance fell into the storm’s shadow, then was\nilluminated by the striking of bright red lightning.\nVenli stepped forward and hummed to Craving, holding her arms out to\nthe sides. The storm wasn’t like the highstorms—no stormwall of blown\ndebris and cremwater. This was far more elegant. It was a billowing cloud\nof smoke and darkness, lightning breaking out on all sides, coloring it\ncrimson.\nShe tipped her head back to meet the boiling, churning clouds, and was\nconsumed by the storm.\nAngry, violent darkness overshadowed her. Flecks of burning ash\nstreamed past her on all sides, and she felt no rain this time. Just the beat of\nthunder. The storm’s pulse.\nAsh bit into her skin, and something crashed down beside her, rolling on\nthe stones. A tree? Yes, a burning tree. Sand, shredded bark, and pebbles\nwashed across her skin and carapace. She knelt down, eyes squeezed\nclosed, arms protecting her face from the blown debris.\nSomething larger glanced off her arm, cracking her carapace. She gasped\nand dropped to the stone ground, curling up.\nA pressure enveloped her, pushing at her mind, her soul. Let Me In.\nWith difficulty, she opened herself up to this force. This was just like\nadopting a new form, right?\nPain seared her insides, as if someone had set fire to her veins. She\nscreamed, and sand bit her tongue. Tiny coals ripped at her clothing,\nsingeing her skin.\nAnd then, a voice.\nWHAT IS THIS?\nIt was a warm voice. An ancient, paternal voice, kindly and enveloping.\n“Please,” Venli said, gasping in breaths of smoky air. “Please.”\nYES, the voice said. CHOOSE ANOTHER. THIS ONE IS MINE.\nThe force that had been pushing against her retreated, and the pain\nstopped. Something else—something smaller, less domineering—took its\nplace. She accepted this spren gladly, then whimpered in relief, attuned to\nAgony.\nAn eternity seemed to pass as she lay huddled before the storm. Finally,\nthe winds weakened. The lightning faded. The thunder moved into the\ndistance.\nShe blinked the grit from her eyes. Bits of cremstone and broken bark\nstreamed from her as she moved. She coughed, then stood, looking at her\nruined clothing and singed skin.\nShe no longer bore stormform. She’d changed to … was this\nnimbleform? Her clothing felt large on her, and her body no longer bore its\nimpressive musculature. She attuned the rhythms, and found they were still\nthe new ones—the violent, angry rhythms that came with forms of power.\nThis wasn’t nimbleform, but it also wasn’t anything she recognized. She\nhad breasts—though they were small, as with most forms outside of\nmateform—and long hairstrands.

She turned about to see if the others were\nthe same.\nDemid stood nearby, and though his clothing was in tatters, his well-\nmuscled body wasn’t scored. He stood tall—far taller than her—with a\nbroad chest and powerful stance. He seemed more like a statue than a\nlistener. He flexed, eyes glowing red, and his body pulsed with a dark violet\npower—a glow that somehow evoked both light and darkness at once. It\nretreated, but Demid seemed pleased by his ability to invoke it.\nWhat form was that? So majestic, with ridges of carapace poking\nthrough his skin along the arms and at the corners of the face. “Demid?” she\nasked.\nHe turned toward Melu, who strode up in a similar form and said\nsomething in a language Venli didn’t recognize. The rhythms were there\nthough, and this was to Derision.\n“Demid?” Venli asked again. “How do you feel? What happened?”\nHe spoke again in that strange language, and his next words seemed to\nblur in her mind, somehow shifting until she understood them. “… Odium\nrides the very winds, like the enemy once did. Incredible. Aharat, is that\nyou?”\n“Yes,” Melu said. “This … this feels … good.”\n“Feel,” Demid said. “It feels.” He took a long, deep breath. “It feels.”\nHad they gone mad?\nNearby, Mrun pulled himself past a large boulder, which had not been\nthere before. With horror, Venli realized that she could see a broken arm\nunderneath it, blood leaking out. In direct defiance of Ulim’s promise of\nsafety, one of them had been crushed.\nThough Mrun had been blessed with a tall, imperious form like the\nothers, he stumbled as he stepped away from the boulder. He grabbed the\nstone, then fell to his knees. His body coursing with that dark violet light,\nhe groaned, muttering gibberish. Altoki approached from the other\ndirection, standing low, teeth bared, her steps like those of a predator. When\nshe drew closer, Venli could hear her whispering between bared teeth.\n“High sky. Dead winds. Blood rain.”\n“Demid,” Venli said to Destruction. “Something has gone wrong. Sit\ndown, wait. I will find the spren.”\nDemid looked at her. “You knew this corpse?”\n“This corpse? Demid, why—”\n“Oh no. Oh no. Oh no!” Ulim coursed across the ground to her. “You—\nYou aren’t— Oh, bad, bad.”\n“Ulim!” Venli demanded, attuning Derision and gesturing at Demid.\n“Something is wrong with my companions. What have you brought upon\nus?”\n“Don’t talk to them, Venli!” Ulim said, forming into the shape of a little\nman. “Don’t point at them!”\nNearby, Demid was pooling dark violet power in his hand somehow,\nstudying her and Ulim. “It is you,” he said to Ulim. “The Envoy. You have\nmy respect for your work, spren.”\nUlim bowed to Demid. “Please, grand of the Fused, see passion and\nforgive this child.”"

Concerned,\noverwhelmed by her experience, Venli attuned Agony and followed.\nBehind, Demid and the others were gathering.\nUlim formed as a person again before her. “You’re lucky. He could have\ndestroyed you.”\n“Demid would never do that.”\n“Unfortunately for you, your once-mate is gone. That’s Hariel—and he\nhas one of the worst tempers of all the Fused.”\n“Hariel? What do you mean by…” She trailed off as the others spoke\nsoftly to Demid. They stood so tall, so haughty, and their mannerisms—all\nwrong.\nEach new form changed a listener, down to their ways of thinking, even\ntheir temperament. Despite that, you were always you. Even stormform\nhadn’t changed her into someone else. Perhaps … she had become less\nempathetic, more aggressive. But she’d still been herself.\nThis was different. Demid didn’t stand like her once-mate, or speak like\nhim.\n“No…” she whispered. “You said we were opening ourselves up to a\nnew spren, a new form!”\n“I said,” Ulim hissed, “that you were opening yourselves up. I didn’t say\nwhat would enter. Look, your gods need bodies. It’s like this every Return.\nYou should be flattered.”\n“Flattered to be killed?”\n“Yeah, for the good of the race,” Ulim said. “Those are the Fused:\nancient souls reborn. What you have, apparently, is just another form of\npower. A bond with a lesser Voidspren, which puts you above common\nlisteners—who have normal forms—but a step below the Fused. A big\nstep.”\nShe nodded, then started to walk back toward the group.\n“Wait,” Ulim said, rippling across the ground before her. “What are you\ndoing? What is wrong with you?”\n“I’m going to send that soul out,” she said. “Bring Demid back. He\nneeds to know the consequences before he can choose such a drastic—”\n“Back?” Ulim said. “Back? He’s dead. As you should be. This is bad.\nWhat did you do? Resist, like that sister of yours?”\n“Out of my way.”\n“He’ll kill you. I warned of his temper—”\n“Envoy,” Demid said to Destruction, turning toward them. It wasn’t his\nvoice.\nShe attuned Agony. It wasn’t his voice.\n“Let her pass,” the thing with Demid’s body said. “I will speak with her.”\nUlim sighed. “Bother.”\n“You speak like a human, spren,” Demid said. “Your service here was\ngrand, but you use their ways, their language.

And Odium himself, god\nof gods, had a purpose for her. She sat down on the ground to wait as the\nFused conversed in their strange language. As she waited, she noted\nsomething hovering near the ground a short distance away. A little spren\nthat looked like a ball of light. Yes … she’d seen one of those near Eshonai.\nWhat was it?\nIt seemed agitated, and scooted across the stone closer to her.

Indeed, he was worried. Odium. Though the Stormfather had\nreturned to his previous self-confident ways, Dalinar could not shake the\nmemory of the mighty spren whimpering in fright.\nNavani and Jasnah had eagerly feasted on his account of meeting the\ndark god, though they’d chosen not to publish this one for wide\ndissemination.\n“Maybe,” Navani said, “this was somehow another preplanned event,\nplaced by Honor for you to encounter.”\nDalinar shook his head. “Odium felt real. I truly interacted with him.”\n“You can interact with the people in the visions. Just not the Almighty\nhimself.”\n“Because, you theorize, the Almighty couldn’t create a full simulacrum\nof a god. No. I saw eternity, Navani … a divine vastness.”\nHe shivered. For now, they had decided to suspend use of the visions.\nWho knew what risk they’d run by bringing people’s minds in and\npotentially exposing them to Odium?\nOf course, who’s to say what he can and cannot touch in the real world?\nDalinar thought. He looked up again, the sun burning white, the sky a faded\nblue. He would have thought that being above the clouds would give him\nmore perspective.\nTaravangian and Adrotagia finally arrived, followed by Taravangian’s\nstrange Surgebinder, the short-haired woman, Malata. Dalinar’s guards\nbrought up the rear. Rial saluted him. Again.\n“You don’t need to salute me each time I look at you, Sergeant,” Dalinar\nsaid dryly.\n“Just trying ta be extra careful, sir.” The leathery, dark-skinned man\nsaluted one more time. “Wouldn’t want ta be reported for being\ndisrespectful.”\n“I didn’t mention you by name, Rial.”\n“Everyone knew anyway, Brightlord.”\n“Imagine that.”\nRial grinned, and Dalinar waved for the man to open his canteen, then\nsniffed for alcohol. “It’s clean this time?”\n“Absolutely! You chastised me last time. Water only.”\n“And so you keep the alcohol…”\n“In my flask, sir,” Rial said. “Right leg pocket of my uniform. Don’t\nworry though. It’s buttoned up tight, and I’ve completely forgotten it’s\nthere.

The\npatterns on the floor, however, were glyphs in the Dawnchant. This building\nwould be identical to one in Thaylen City—and when engaged, it would\nswap places with that one.\nTen platforms here, ten across the world. The glyphs on the floors\nindicated that it might somehow be possible to transport directly from one\ncity to another without coming to Urithiru first. They hadn’t discovered how\nthat might work, and for now each gate could swap only with its twin—and\nthey had to first be unlocked from both sides.\nNavani went straight for the control mechanism. Malata joined her,\nwatching over Navani’s shoulder as she fiddled with the keyhole, which was\nin the center of a ten-pointed star on a metal plate. “Yes,” Navani said,\nconsulting some notes. “The mechanism is the same as the one to the\nShattered Plains. You need to twist this here…”\nShe wrote something via spanreed to Thaylen City, then ushered them\nback outside. A moment later, the building itself flashed—a ring of\nStormlight running around it, like the afterimage of a firebrand being waved\nin the dark. Then Kaladin and Shallan emerged from the doorway.\n“It worked!” Shallan said as she bounced out, bubbling over with\neagerness. In contrast, Kaladin stepped out with a firm gait. “Transferring\nonly the control buildings, instead of the entire platform, should save us\nStormlight.”\n“Up until now,” Navani said, “we’ve been working the Oathgates at full\npower for every transfer. I suspect that’s not the only mistake we’ve made\nin regard to this place and its devices. Anyway, now that you two have\nunlocked the Thaylen gate on their end, we should be able to use it at will—\nwith the help of a Radiant, of course.”\n“Sir,” Kaladin said to Dalinar, “the queen is prepared to meet with you.”\nTaravangian, Navani, Adrotagia, and Malata entered the building, though\nShallan started down the ramp back toward Urithiru. Dalinar took Kaladin\nby the arm as he moved to follow.\n“The flight in front of the highstorm went well?” Dalinar asked.\n“No problems, sir. I’m confident it will work.”\n“Next storm then, soldier, make for Kholinar. I’m counting on you and\nAdolin to keep Elhokar from doing anything too foolhardy. Be careful.\nSomething strange is going on inside the city, and I can’t afford to lose\nyou.”\n“Yes, sir.”\n“As you fly, wave to the lands along the south fork of the Deathbend\nRiver. The parshmen may have conquered them by now, but they actually\nbelong to you.”\n“… Sir?”"

The parshmen may have conquered them by now, but they actually\nbelong to you.”\n“… Sir?”\n“You’re a Shardbearer, Kaladin. That makes you at least fourth dahn,\nwhich should be a landed title. Elhokar found you a nice portion along the\nriver that reverted to the crown last year at the death of its brightlord, who\nhad no heir. It’s not as large as some, but it is yours now.”\nKaladin looked stunned. “Are there villages on this land, sir?”\n“Six or seven; one town of note. The river is one of the most consistent\nin Alethkar. It doesn’t even dry up in the Midpeace. That’s on a good\ncaravan route. Your people will do well.”\n“Sir. You know I don’t want this burden.”\n“If you’d wanted a life without burdens, you shouldn’t have said the\noaths,” Dalinar said. “We don’t get to choose things like this, son. Just make\nsure you have a good steward, wise scribes, and some solid men of the fifth\nand sixth dahns to lead the towns. Personally, I’ll count us lucky—you\nincluded—if at the end of all this we still have a kingdom to burden us.”\nKaladin nodded slowly. “My family is in northern Alethkar. Now that\nI’ve practiced flying with the storms, I’ll want to go and fetch them, once I\nget back from the Kholinar mission.”\n“Get that Oathgate open, and you can have as much time as you want. I\nguarantee, the best thing you can do for your family right now is keep\nAlethkar from falling.”\nBy spanreed reports, the Voidbringers were slowly moving northward,\nand had captured much of Alethkar. Relis Ruthar had tried to gather the\nremaining Alethi forces in the country, but had been pushed back toward\nHerdaz, suffering at the hands of the Fused. However, the Voidbringers\nweren’t killing noncombatants. Kaladin’s family should be safe enough.\nThe captain jogged off down the ramp, and Dalinar watched, thinking\nabout his own burdens. Once Elhokar and Adolin returned from the mission\nto rescue Kholinar, they’d need to get on with Elhokar’s highking\narrangement. He still hadn’t announced that, not even to the highprinces.\nA part of Dalinar knew he should simply go forward with it now, naming\nAdolin highprince and stepping down, but he delayed. This would make a\nfinal separation between himself and his homeland. He’d at least like to\nhelp recover the capital first.\nDalinar joined the others in the control building, then nodded toward\nMalata. She summoned her Shardblade and inserted it into the slot. The\nmetal of the plate shifted and flowed, matching the shape of the Blade.\nThey’d run tests, and though the walls of the buildings were thin, you\ncouldn’t see the other end of the Shardblade jutting through. The Blade was\nmelding into the mechanism.\nMalata pushed against the side of the Blade’s hilt. The inner wall of the\ncontrol building rotated.

The floor underneath the mosaics began glowing,\nilluminating them like stained glass. She stopped her Blade at the proper\nposition, and a flash of light later, they had arrived. Dalinar stepped out of\nthe small building onto a platform in distant Thaylen City, a port on the\nwestern coast of a large southern island near the Frostlands.\nHere the platform that surrounded the Oathgate had been turned into a\nsculpture garden—but most of the sculptures lay toppled and broken. Queen\nFen waited on the ramp up with her attendants. Shallan had probably told\nher to wait there in case the room-only transfer didn’t work.\nThe platform was high up in the city, and as Dalinar neared the edge, he\nsaw that it gave an excellent view. The sight of it made Dalinar’s breath\ncatch.\nThaylen City was a mountainside metropolis like Kharbranth, placed\nwith its back to a mountain to provide shelter from the highstorms. Though\nDalinar had never been to the city before, he’d studied maps, and knew\nThaylen City had once included only a section near the center they called\nthe Ancient Ward. This raised portion had a distinctive shape formed by the\nway the rocks had been carved millennia ago.\nThe city had long since been built beyond that. A lower section called the\nLow Ward cluttered the stones around the base of the wall—a wide, squat\nfortification to the west that ran from the cliffs on one side of the city to the\nmountain foothills on the other.\nAbove and behind the Ancient Ward, the city had expanded up a series of\nsteplike tiers. These Loft Wards ended at a majestic Royal Ward at the top\nof the city, holding palaces, mansions, and temples. The Oathgate platform\nwas on this level, at the northern edge of the city, close to the cliffs down to\nthe ocean.\nOnce, this place would have been stunning because of its magnificent\narchitecture. Today, Dalinar paused for a different reason. Dozens …\nhundreds of buildings had fallen in. Entire sections had become rubble\nwhen higher structures, smashed by the Everstorm, had slid down on top of\nthem. What had once been one of the finest cities of all Roshar—known for\nits art, trade, and fine marble—was cracked and broken, like a dinner plate\ndropped by a careless maid.\nIronically, many more modest buildings at the base of the city—in the\nwall’s shadow—had weathered the storm. But the famous Thaylen docks\nwere out beyond this fortification, on the small western peninsula fronting\nthe city. This area had once been densely developed—likely with\nwarehouses, taverns, and shops. All wood.\nThey’d been swept away completely. Only smashed ruins remained.\nStormfather. No wonder Fen had resisted his distracting demands. Most\nof this destruction had been caused by that first full Everstorm; Thaylen\nCity was particularly exposed, with no land to break the storm as it surged\nacross the western ocean. Beyond that, many more of these structures had\nbeen of wood, particularly in the Loft Wards. A luxury available to a place\nlike Thaylen City, which up until now had been subject only to the most\nmild of the stormwinds."

A luxury available to a place\nlike Thaylen City, which up until now had been subject only to the most\nmild of the stormwinds.\nThe Everstorm had come five times now, though subsequent passings\nhad—blessedly—been tamer than the first. Dalinar lingered, taking it in,\nbefore leading his group to where Queen Fen stood on the ramp with a\ncollection of scribes, lighteyes, and guards. This included her prince\nconsort, Kmakl, an aging Thaylen man with matching mustaches and\neyebrows, both drooping down to frame his face. He wore a vest and cap,\nand was attended by two ardents as scribes.\n“Fen…” Dalinar said softly. “I’m sorry.”\n“We lived too long in luxury, it seems,” Fen said, and he was\nmomentarily surprised by her accent. It hadn’t been present in the visions.\n“I remember as a child worrying that everyone in other countries would\ndiscover how nice things were here, with the mild straits weather and the\nbroken storms. I assumed we’d be swarmed with immigrants someday.”\nShe turned toward her city, and sighed softly.\nHow would it have been to live here? He tried to imagine living in\nhomes that didn’t feel like fortresses. Buildings of wood with broad\nwindows. Roofs needed only for keeping the rain off. He’d heard people\njoke that in Kharbranth, you had to hang a bell outside to know when the\nhighstorm had arrived, for otherwise you’d miss it. Fortunately for\nTaravangian, that city’s slightly southern orientation had prevented\ndevastation on this scale.\n“Well,” Fen said, “let’s do a tour. I think there are a few places worth\nseeing that are still standing.”\n59. Bondsmith\nIf this is to be permanent, then I wish to leave record of my husband\nand children. Wzmal, as good a man as any woman could dream of\nloving. Kmakra and Molinar, the true gemstones of my life.\n—From drawer 12-15, ruby\n“The temple of Shalash,” Fen said, gesturing as they entered.\nTo Dalinar, it looked much like the others she’d shown them: a large\nspace with a high-domed ceiling and massive braziers. Here, ardents burned\nthousands of glyphwards for the people, who supplicated the Almighty for\nmercy and aid. Smoke pooled in the dome before leaking out through holes\nin the roof, like water through a sieve.\nHow many prayers have we burned, Dalinar wondered uncomfortably, to\na god who is no longer there? Or is someone else receiving them instead?\nDalinar nodded politely as Fen recounted the ancient origin of the\nstructure and listed some of the kings or queens who had been crowned\nhere. She explained the significance of the elaborate design on the rear wall,\nand led them around the sides to view the carvings. It was a pity to see\nseveral statues with the faces broken off. How had the storm gotten to them\nin here?\nWhen they were done, she led them back outside onto the Royal Ward,\nwhere the palanquins waited. Navani nudged him.\n“What?” he asked softly.\n“Stop scowling.”\n“I’m not scowling.”\n“You’re bored.”"

Navani nudged him.\n“What?” he asked softly.\n“Stop scowling.”\n“I’m not scowling.”\n“You’re bored.”\n“I’m not … scowling.”\nShe raised an eyebrow.\n“Six temples?” he asked. “This city is practically rubble, and we’re\nlooking at temples.”\nAhead, Fen and her consort climbed into their palanquin. So far, Kmakl’s\nonly part in the tour had been to stand behind Fen and—whenever she said\nsomething he thought significant—nod for her scribes to record it in the\nofficial histories.\nKmakl didn’t carry a sword. In Alethkar, that would indicate the man—\nat least one of his rank—was a Shardbearer, but that was not the case here.\nThaylenah had only five Blades—and three suits of Plate—each held by an\nancient family line sworn to defend the throne. Couldn’t Fen have taken\nhim on a tour to see those Shards instead?\n“Scowling…” Navani said.\n“It’s what they expect of me,” Dalinar said, nodding toward the Thaylen\nofficers and scribes. Near the front, one group of soldiers in particular had\nwatched Dalinar with keen interest. Perhaps this tour’s true intent was to\ngive those lighteyes a chance to study him.\nThe palanquin he shared with Navani was scented like rockbud\nblossoms. “The progression from temple to temple,” Navani said softly as\ntheir bearers lifted the palanquin, “is traditional in Thaylen City. Visiting all\nten allows a survey of the Royal Ward, and is a not-so-subtle reinforcement\nof the throne’s Vorin piety. They’ve had trouble with the church in the past.”\n“I sympathize. Do you think if I explain I’m a heretic too, she’ll stop\nwith all the pomp?”\nNavani leaned forward in the small palanquin, putting her freehand on\nhis knee. “Dear one, if this kind of thing irks you so, we could send a\ndiplomat.”\n“I am a diplomat.”\n“Dalinar…”\n“This is my duty now, Navani. I have to do my duty. Every time I’ve\nignored it in the past, something terrible has happened.” He took her hands\nin his. “I complain because I can be unguarded with you. I’ll keep the\nscowling to a minimum. I promise.”\nAs their porters skillfully carried them up some steps, Dalinar watched\nout the palanquin window. This upper section of the city had weathered the\nstorm well enough, as many of the structures here were of thick stone. Still,\nsome had cracked, and a few roofs had fallen in. The palanquin passed a\nfallen statue, which had broken off at the ankles and toppled from a ledge\ntoward the Loft Wards.\nThis city was hit harder than any I’ve had a report about, he thought.\nThis level of destruction is unique. Is it just all that wood, and the lack of\nanything to blunt the storm? Or is it more? Some reports of the Everstorm\nmentioned no winds, only lightning. Others confusingly reported no rain,\nbut burning embers. The Everstorm varied greatly, even within the same\npassing."

The Everstorm varied greatly, even within the same\npassing.\n“It’s probably comforting for Fen to do something familiar,” Navani told\nhim quietly as the porters set them down at the next stop. “This tour is a\nreminder of days before the city suffered such terrors.”\nHe nodded. With that in mind, it was easier to bear the thought of yet\nanother temple.\nOutside, they found Fen emerging from her palanquin. “The temple of\nBattah, one of the oldest in the city. But of course the greatest sight here is\nthe Simulacrum of Paralet, the grand statue that…” She trailed off, and\nDalinar followed her gaze to the stone feet of the statue nearby. “Oh.\nRight.”\n“Let’s see the temple,” Dalinar urged. “You said it’s one of the oldest.\nWhich are older?”\n“Only Ishi’s temple is more ancient,” she said. “But we won’t linger\nthere, or here.”\n“We won’t?” Dalinar asked, noticing the lack of prayer smoke from this\nroof. “Is the structure damaged?”\n“The structure? No, not the structure.”\nA pair of tired ardents emerged and walked down the steps, their robes\nstained with flecks of red. Dalinar looked to Fen. “Do you mind if I go up\nanyway?”\n“If you wish.”\nAs Dalinar climbed the steps with Navani, he caught a scent on the wind.\nThe scent of blood, which reminded him of battle. At the top, the sight\ninside the doors of the temple was a familiar one. Hundreds of wounded\ncovered the marble floor, lying on simple pallets, painspren reaching out\nlike orange sinew hands between them.\n“We had to improvise,” Fen said, stepping up behind him in the\ndoorway, “after our traditional hospitals filled.”\n“So many?” Navani said, safehand to her mouth. “Can’t some be sent\nhome to heal, to their families?”\nDalinar read the answers in the suffering people. Some were waiting to\ndie; they’d bled internally, or had rampant infections, marked by tiny red\nrotspren on their skin. Others had no homes left, evidenced by the families\nthat huddled around a wounded mother, father, or child.\nStorms … Dalinar felt almost ashamed at how well his people had\nweathered the Everstorm. When he eventually turned to go, he almost ran\ninto Taravangian, who haunted the doorway like a spirit. Frail, draped in\nsoft robes, the aged monarch was weeping openly as he regarded the people\nin the temple.\n“Please,” he said. “Please. My surgeons are in Vedenar, an easy trip\nthrough the Oathgates. Let me bring them. Let me ease this suffering.”\nFen pursed her lips to a thin line. She’d agreed to meet, but that didn’t\nmake her a part of Dalinar’s proposed coalition. But what could she say to a\nplea like that?\n“Your help would be appreciated,” she said.\nDalinar suppressed a smile. She’d conceded one step by letting them\nactivate the Oathgate. This was another one. Taravangian, you are a gem.\n“Lend me a scribe and spanreed,” Taravangian said. “I will have my"

Taravangian, you are a gem.\n“Lend me a scribe and spanreed,” Taravangian said. “I will have my\nRadiant bring aid immediately.”\nFen gave the necessary orders, her consort nodding for the words to be\nrecorded. As they walked back toward the palanquins, Taravangian lingered\non the steps, looking out over the city.\n“Your Majesty?” Dalinar asked, pausing.\n“I can see my home in this, Brightlord.” He put a trembling hand against\nthe wall of the temple for support. “I blink bleary eyes, and I see\nKharbranth destroyed in war. And I ask, ‘What must I do to preserve them?’\n”\n“We will protect them, Taravangian. I vow it.”\n“Yes … Yes, I believe you, Blackthorn.” He took a long, drawn-out\nbreath, and seemed to wilt further. “I think … I think I shall remain here\nand await my surgeons. Please go on.”\nTaravangian sat down on the steps as the rest of them walked away. At\nhis palanquin, Dalinar looked back up and saw the old man sitting there,\nhands clasped before himself, liver-spotted head bowed, almost in the\nattitude of one kneeling before a burning prayer.\nFen stepped up beside Dalinar. The white ringlets of her eyebrows shook\nin the wind. “He is far more than people think of him, even after his\naccident. I’ve often said it.”\nDalinar nodded.\n“But,” Fen continued, “he acts as if this city is a burial ground. That is\nnot the case. We will rebuild from stone. My engineers plan to put walls on\nthe front of each ward. We’ll get our feet underneath us again. We just have\nto get ahead of the storm. It’s the sudden loss of labor that really crippled\nus. Our parshmen…”\n“My armies could do much to help clear rubble, move stones, and\nrebuild,” Dalinar said. “Simply give the word, and you will have access to\nthousands of willing hands.”\nFen said nothing, though Dalinar caught muttered words from the young\nsoldiers and attendants waiting beside the palanquins. Dalinar let his\nattention linger on them, picking out one in particular. Tall for a Thaylen,\nthe young man had blue eyes, with eyebrows combed and starched straight\nback alongside his head. His crisp uniform was, naturally, cut in the\nThaylen style, with a shorter jacket that buttoned tight across the upper\nchest.\nThat will be her son, Dalinar thought, studying the young man’s features.\nBy Thaylen tradition, he would be merely another officer, not the heir. The\nmonarchy of the kingdom was not a hereditary position.\nHeir or not, this young man was important. He whispered something\njeering, and the others nodded, muttering and glaring at Dalinar.\nNavani nudged Dalinar and gave him a questioning look.\nLater, he mouthed, then turned to Queen Fen. “So the temple of Ishi is\nfull of wounded as well?”\n“Yes. Perhaps we can skip that.”\n“I wouldn’t mind seeing the lower wards of the city,” Dalinar said.\n“Perhaps the grand bazaar I’ve heard so much about?”"

Perhaps we can skip that.”\n“I wouldn’t mind seeing the lower wards of the city,” Dalinar said.\n“Perhaps the grand bazaar I’ve heard so much about?”\nNavani winced, and Fen grew stiff.\n“It was … by the docks then, was it?” Dalinar said, looking out at the\nrubble-filled plain before the city. He’d assumed that it would have been in\nthe Ancient Ward, the central part of the city. He should have paid better\nattention to those maps, apparently.\n“I have refreshments set up at the courtyard of Talenelat,” Fen said. “It\nwas to be the last stop on our tour. Shall we go directly there now?”\nDalinar nodded, and they reboarded the palanquins. Inside, he leaned\nforward and spoke softly to Navani. “Queen Fen is not an absolute\nauthority.”\n“Even your brother wasn’t absolutely powerful.”\n“But the Thaylen monarch is worse. The councils of merchants and naval\nofficers pick the new monarch, after all. They have great influence in the\ncity.”\n“Yes. Where are you going with this?”\n“It means she can’t accede to my requests on her own,” Dalinar said.\n“She can never agree to military aid as long as elements in the city believe\nthat I’m bent on domination.” He found some nuts in an armrest\ncompartment and began munching on them.\n“We don’t have time for a drawn-out political thaw,” Navani said,\nwaving for him to hand her some nuts. “Teshav might have family in the\ncity she can lean on.”\n“We could try that. Or … I have an idea budding.”\n“Does it involve punching someone?”\nHe nodded. To which she sighed.\n“They’re waiting for a spectacle,” Dalinar said. “They want to see what\nthe Blackthorn will do. Queen Fen … she was the same way, in the visions.\nShe didn’t open up to me until I gave her my honest face.”\n“Your honest face doesn’t have to be that of a killer, Dalinar.”\n“I’ll try not to kill anyone,” he said. “I just need to give them a lesson. A\ndisplay.”\nA lesson. A display.\nThose words caught in his mind, and he found himself reaching back\nthrough his memories toward something still fuzzy, undefined.\nSomething … something to do with the Rift and … and with Sadeas?\nThe memory darted away, just beneath the surface of his awareness. His\nsubconscious shied from it, and he flinched like he’d been slapped.\nIn that direction … in that direction was pain.\n“Dalinar?” Navani said. “I suppose it’s possible you’re right. Perhaps the\npeople seeing you be polite and calm is actually bad for our message.”\n“More scowls, then?”\nShe sighed. “More scowls.”\nHe grinned.\n“Or a grin,” she added. “From you, one of those can be more disturbing.”\nThe courtyard of Talenelat was a large stone square dedicated to\nStonesinew, Herald of Soldiers. Atop a set of steps was the temple itself, but\nthey didn’t get a chance to look inside, for the main entrance had collapsed.\nA large, rectangular stone block—that had once spanned the top of the\ndoorway—rested wedged downward inside it."

A large black scorch\nat the top of the wall showed where the strange Everstorm lightning had\nblasted the building.\nNone of the other temples had fared this poorly. It was as if Odium had a\ngrudge against this one in particular.\nTalenelat, Dalinar thought. He was the one they abandoned. The one I\nlost …\n“I have some business to attend to,” Fen said. “With trade to the city\ndisrupted so seriously, I haven’t much to offer as victuals. Some nuts and\nfruit, some salted fish. We’ve laid them out for you to enjoy. I’ll return later\nso we can conference. In the meantime, my attendants will see to your\nneeds.”\n“Thank you,” Dalinar said. They both knew she was making him wait on\npurpose. It wouldn’t be long—maybe a half hour. Not enough to be an\ninsult, but enough to establish that she was still the authority here, no matter\nhow powerful he was.\nEven though he wanted some time with her people, he found himself\nannoyed at the gamesmanship of it. Fen and her consort withdrew, leaving\nmost of the rest behind to enjoy the repast.\nDalinar, instead, decided to pick a fight.\nFen’s son would do. He did appear the most critical among those talking.\nI don’t want to seem the aggressor, Dalinar thought, positioning himself\nclose to the young man. And I should pretend I haven’t guessed who he is.\n“The temples were nice,” Navani said, joining him. “But you didn’t\nenjoy them, did you? You wished to see something more militaristic.”\nAn excellent opening. “You are right,” he said. “You there. Captainlord.\nI’m not one for dallying. Show me the city’s wall. That is something of real\ninterest.”\n“Are you serious?” Fen’s son said in Thaylen-accented Alethi, words all\nmashed together.\n“Always. What? Are your armies in such bad shape that you’d be\nembarrassed to let me see them?”\n“I’m not going to let an enemy general inspect our defenses.”\n“I’m not your enemy, son.”\n“I’m not your son, tyrant.”\nDalinar made a big show of looking resigned. “You’ve been shadowing\nme this entire day, soldier, speaking words that I’ve chosen not to hear.\nYou’re close to a line that, if crossed, will earn a response.”\nThe young man paused, showing some measure of restraint. He weighed\nwhat he was getting himself into, and decided that the risk was worth the\nreward. Humiliate the Blackthorn here, and maybe he could save his city—\nat least as he saw it.\n“I regret only,” the man snapped, “that I didn’t speak loudly enough for\nyou to hear the insults, despot.”\nDalinar sighed loudly, then began unbuttoning his uniform jacket,\nleaving himself in the snug undershirt."

Dalinar preferred this anyway.\nThe man covered his nervousness by demanding one of his attendants\nuse a rock to draw a ring on the ground. Rial and Dalinar’s guards\napproached, anticipationspren whipping nervously in their wakes. Dalinar\nwaved them back.\n“Don’t hurt him,” Navani whispered. She hesitated. “But don’t lose\neither.”\n“I’m not going to hurt him,” Dalinar said, handing her his jacket. “I can’t\npromise the part about losing.” She didn’t see—but of course she didn’t. He\ncouldn’t simply beat this man up. All that would do was prove to the rest of\nthem that Dalinar was a bully.\nHe strode to the ring and paced it off, to memorize how many steps he\ncould take without being forced out.\n“I said longswords,” the young man said, weapon in hand. “Where’s\nyour sword?”\n“We’ll do this by alternating advantage, three minutes,” Dalinar said.\n“To first blood. You may lead off.”\nThe young man froze. Alternating advantage. The youth would have\nthree minutes armed, against Dalinar unarmed. If Dalinar survived without\nbeing bloodied or leaving the ring, he’d have three minutes against his\nopponent in the reverse: Dalinar armed, the young man unarmed.\nIt was a ridiculous imbalance, usually only seen in sparring practice,\nwhen men trained for situations where they might be unarmed against an\narmed foe. And then, you’d never use real weapons.\n“I…” the young man said. “I’ll switch to a knife.”\n“No need. Longsword is fine.”\nThe young man gaped at Dalinar. Songs and stories told of the heroic\nunarmed man facing down many armed opponents, but in truth, fighting a\nsingle armed foe was incredibly difficult.\nFen’s son shrugged. “As much as I’d love to be known as the man who\nbested the Blackthorn on even terms,” he said, “I’ll take an unfair fight. But\nhave your men here swear an oath that if this goes poorly for you, I’ll not be\nnamed an assassin.

She counted off the start, and\nthe young man came for Dalinar immediately, swinging like he meant it.\nGood. If you were going to agree to a fight like this, you shouldn’t hesitate.\nDalinar dodged, then dropped into a wrestling stance, though he didn’t\nintend to get close enough to try for a hold. As the scribe counted off the\ntime, Dalinar continued to dodge attacks, hovering around the outside of the\nring, careful not to step over the line.\nFen’s son—though aggressive—displayed some innate wariness. The\nyoung man probably could have forced Dalinar out, but he kept testing\ninstead. He came in again, and Dalinar scrambled away from the flashing\nsword."

He came in again, and Dalinar scrambled away from the flashing\nsword.\nThe young man grew concerned and frustrated. Perhaps if it had been\ncloudy, he would have seen the faint glow of the Stormlight Dalinar was\nholding.\nAs the countdown drew near the end, the young man grew more frantic.\nHe knew what was coming. Three minutes alone in a ring, unarmed against\nthe Blackthorn. The attacks strayed from hesitant, to determined, to\ndesperate.\nAll right, Dalinar thought. Just about now …\nThe countdown hit ten. The young man came at him with a last-ditch,\nall-out assault.\nDalinar stood up, relaxed, and held his hands to the sides so that the\naudience could see him intentionally fail to dodge. Then he stepped into the\nyoung man’s thrust.\nThe longsword hit him right in the chest, just to the left of his heart.\nDalinar grunted at the impact, and the pain, but managed to take the sword\nin a way that it missed the spine.\nBlood filled one of his lungs, and Stormlight rushed to heal him. The\nyoung man looked aghast, as if—despite everything—he hadn’t expected,\nor wanted, to land such a decisive blow.\nThe pain faded. Dalinar coughed, spat blood to the side, then took the\nyoung man’s hand by the wrist, shoving the sword farther through his chest.\nThe young man released the sword hilt and scrabbled backward, eyes\nbulging.\n“That was a good thrust,” Dalinar said, voice watery and ragged. “I\ncould see how worried you were at the end; others might have let their form\nsuffer.”\nThe queen’s son dropped to his knees, staring up as Dalinar stepped\ncloser and loomed over him. Blood seeped around the wound, staining his\nshirt, until the Stormlight finally had time to heal the external cuts. Dalinar\ndrew in enough that he glowed even in the daylight.\nThe courtyard had grown silent. Scribes held their mouths, aghast.\nSoldiers put hands on swords, shockspren—like yellow triangles—\nshattering around them.\nNavani shared a sly smile with him, arms folded.\nDalinar took the sword by the hilt and slid it from his chest. Stormlight\nrushed to heal the wound.\nTo his credit, the young man stood up and stammered, “It’s your turn,\nBlackthorn. I’m ready.”\n“No, you blooded me.”\n“You let me.”\nDalinar took off his shirt and tossed it at the youth. “Give me your shirt,\nand we’ll call it even.”\nThe youth caught the bloody shirt, then looked up at Dalinar in\nbefuddlement.\n“I don’t want your life, son,” Dalinar said. “I don’t want your city or\nyour kingdom. If I’d wanted to conquer Thaylenah, I wouldn’t offer you a\nsmiling face and promises of peace. You should know that much from my\nreputation.”\nHe turned to the watching officers, lighteyes, and scribes. He’d\naccomplished his goal. They were in awe of him, afraid.

For\nsome reason, those frightened faces hit him harder than the sword had.\nAngry, ashamed for a reason he still didn’t understand, he turned and\nstrode away, up the steps from the courtyard toward the temple above. He\nwaved away Navani when she came to speak with him.\nAlone. He needed a moment alone. He climbed to the temple, then\nturned and sat down on the steps, putting his back against the stone block\nthat had fallen into the doorway. The Stormfather rumbled in the back of his\nmind. And beyond that sound was …\nDisappointment. What had he just accomplished? He said he didn’t want\nto conquer this people, but what story did his actions tell? I’m stronger than\nyou, they said. I don’t need to fight you. I could crush you without exerting\nmyself.\nWas that what it should feel like to have the Knights Radiant come to\nyour city?\nDalinar felt a twisting nausea deep in his gut. He’d performed stunts like\nthis dozens of times throughout his life—from recruiting Teleb back in his\nyouth, to bullying Elhokar into accepting that Dalinar wasn’t trying to kill\nhim, to more recently forcing Kadash to fight him in the practice chamber.\nBelow, people gathered around Fen’s son, talking animatedly. The young\nman rubbed his chest, as if he’d been the one who’d been struck.\nIn the back of Dalinar’s mind, he heard that same insistent voice. The\none he’d heard from the beginning of the visions.\nUnite them.\n“I’m trying,” Dalinar whispered.\nWhy couldn’t he ever convince anyone peacefully? Why couldn’t he get\npeople to listen without first pounding them bloody—or, conversely,\nshocking them with his own wounds?\nHe sighed, leaning back and resting his head against the stones of the\nbroken temple.\nUnite us. Please.\nThat was … a different voice. A hundred of them overlapping, making\nthe same plea, so quiet he could barely hear them. He closed his eyes, trying\nto pick out the source of those voices.\nStone? Yes, he had a sensation of chunks of stone in pain. Dalinar\nstarted. He was hearing the spren of the temple itself. These temple walls\nhad existed as a single unit for centuries. Now the pieces—cracked and\nruined—hurt. They still viewed themselves as a beautiful set of carvings,\nnot a ruined facade with fallen chunks scattered about. They longed to again\nbe a single entity, unmarred.\nThe spren of the temple cried with many voices, like men weeping over\ntheir broken bodies on a battlefield.\nStorms. Does everything I imagine have to be about destruction? About\ndying, broken bodies, smoke in the air and blood on the stones?\nThe warmth inside of him said that it did not.\nHe stood and turned, full of Stormlight, and seized the fallen stone that\nblocked the doorway. Straining, he shifted the block until he could slip in—\nsquatting—and press his shoulders against it.\nHe took a deep breath, then heaved upward.

It wanted so badly to be\nwhole again.

They’d just gotten the hips of the statue settled back into place;\nDalinar drained Stormlight from borrowed spheres, sealing the stone\ntogether.\n“I think I found the left arm!” a man called from below, where the bulk\nof the statue had toppled through the roof of a mansion. Dalinar’s team of\nsoldiers and lighteyes whooped and rushed down the steps.\n“I did not expect to find the Blackthorn shirtless,” Queen Fen said,\n“and … playing sculptor?”\n“I can only fix inanimate things,” Dalinar said, wiping his hands on a rag\ntied at his waist, exhausted. Using this much Stormlight was a new\nexperience for him, and quite draining. “My son does the more important\nwork.”\nA small family left the temple above.

I’m a fool.” Dalinar shook his head. “Renarin has the ability to\nheal. He is new to his powers, as I am to mine, and can best heal those who\nwere recently wounded. I wonder if it’s similar to what I’m doing. Once the\nsoul grows accustomed to the wound, it’s much harder to fix.”\nA single awespren burst around Fen as the family approached, bowing\nand speaking in Thaylen, the father grinning like a fool. For a moment,\nDalinar felt he could almost understand what they were saying. As if a part\nof him were stretching to bond to the man. A curious experience, one he\ndidn’t quite know how to interpret.\nWhen they left, Dalinar turned to the queen. “I don’t know how long\nRenarin will hold out, and I don’t know how many of those wounds will be\nnew enough for him to fix. But it is something we could do.”\nMen called below, heaving a stone arm out through the window of the\nmansion.\n“I see you’ve charmed Kdralk as well,” Fen noted.\n“He’s a good lad,” Dalinar said.\n“He was determined to find a way to duel you. I hear you gave him that.\nYou’re going to roll over this whole city, charming each person in turn,\naren’t you?”\n“Hopefully not. That sounds like it would take a lot of time.”\nA young man came running down from the temple, holding a child with\nfloppy hair who—though his clothing was torn and dusty—was smiling\nwith a broad grin. The youth bowed to the queen, then thanked Dalinar in\nbroken Alethi. Renarin kept blaming the healings on him.\nFen watched them go with an unreadable expression on her face.\n“I need your help, Fen,” Dalinar whispered.\n“I find it hard to believe you need anything, considering what you’ve\ndone today.”\n“Shardbearers can’t hold ground.”\nShe looked at him, frowning.\n“Sorry. That’s a military maxim. It … never mind. Fen, I have Radiants,\nyes—but they, no matter how powerful, won’t win this war. More\nimportantly, I can’t see what I’m missing. That’s why I need you.\n“I think like an Alethi, as do most of my advisors. We consider the war,\nthe conflict, but miss important facts. When I first learned of Renarin’s\npowers, I thought only of restoring people on the battlefield to continue the\nfight. I need you; I need the Azish. I need a coalition of leaders who see\nwhat I don’t, because we’re facing an enemy that doesn’t think like any\nwe’ve faced before.” He bowed his head to her. “Please.

All right, Blackthorn.\nYou, me, Taravangian. The first real united Vorin coalition the world has\nseen since the Hierocracy. It’s unfortunate that two of us lead kingdoms that\nare in ruin.”\n“Three,” Dalinar said with a grunt. “Kholinar is besieged by the enemy.\nI’ve sent help, but for now, Alethkar is an occupied kingdom.”\n“Wonderful. Well, I think I can persuade the factions in my city to let\nyour troops come and help here. If everything goes well with that, I will\nwrite to the Prime of Azir. Maybe that will help.”\n“I’m certain it will. Now that you’ve joined, the Azish Oathgate is the\nmost essential to our cause.”\n“Well, they’re going to be tricky,” Fen said. “The Azish aren’t as\ndesperate as I am—and frankly, they aren’t Vorin. People here, myself\nincluded, respond to a good push from a determined monarch. Strength and\npassion, the Vorin way. But those tactics will just make the Azish dig in and\nrebuff you harder.”\nHe rubbed his chin. “Do you have any suggestions?”\n“I don’t think you’ll find it very appealing.”\n“Try me,” Dalinar said. “I’m starting to appreciate that the way I usually\ndo things has severe limitations.”\n60.

Highstorms were\nsomething different, like a country in which he was a visiting dignitary.

That method—with the full force of the highstorm raging at his feet\n—seemed far too risky to use when bringing others.

There were six of\nthose, which made their team nine in total, counting himself, Skar, and\nDrehy.\nKing Elhokar was at the front. They couldn’t bring their suits of\nShardplate; Lashings didn’t work on those. Instead, the king wore thick\nclothing and a strange kind of glass-fronted mask to block the wind. Shallan\nhad suggested those; they were apparently naval equipment. Adolin came\nnext. Then two of Shallan’s soldiers—the sloppy deserters she’d collected\nlike wounded axehound pups—and one maidservant. Kaladin didn’t\nunderstand why they’d brought those three, but the king had insisted.\nAdolin and the others were bundled up as much as the king, which made\nShallan look even more odd. She flew in only her blue havah—which she’d\npinned to keep it from fluttering too much—with white leggings\nunderneath. Stormlight surged from her skin, keeping her warm, sustaining\nher.\nHer hair streamed behind her, a stark auburn red. She flew with arms\noutstretched and eyes closed, grinning. Kaladin had to keep adjusting her\nspeed to keep her in line with the others, as she couldn’t resist reaching out\nto feel the wind between her freehand fingers, and waving to windspren as\nthey passed.\nHow does she smile like that? Kaladin wondered. During their trip\nthrough the chasms together, he’d learned her secrets. The wounds she hid.\nAnd yet … she could simply ignore them somehow. Kaladin had never been\nable to do that. Even when he wasn’t feeling particularly grim, he felt\nweighed down by his duties or the people he needed to care for.\nHer heedless joy made him want to show her how to really fly. She\ndidn’t have Lashings, but could still use her body to sculpt the wind and\ndance in the air.…\nHe snapped himself back to the moment, banishing silly daydreams.\nKaladin tucked his arms against himself, making a narrower profile for the\nwind. This made him move up the line of people, so he could renew their\nStormlight each in turn. He didn’t use Stormlight to maneuver so much as\nthe wind itself.\nSkar and Drehy handled their own flight about twenty feet below the\ngroup, watching in case anyone dropped for some reason. Lashings\nrenewed, Kaladin maneuvered himself into line between Shallan and King\nElhokar. The king stared forward through the mask, as if oblivious to the\nwondrous storm beneath. Shallan drifted onto her back, beaming as she\nlooked up at the sky, the hem of her pinned skirts rippling and fluttering.\nAdolin was a different story. He glanced at Kaladin, then closed his eyes\nand gritted his teeth. At least he’d stopped flailing each time they hit a\nchange in the winds.\nThey didn’t speak, as their voices would only be lost to the rushing wind.\nKaladin’s instincts said he could probably lessen the force of the wind while\nflying—he’d done so before—but there were some abilities he had trouble\ndeliberately reproducing."

It soon looped\ninto a ribbon of light and spun up toward him. “We just passed the\nWindrunner River,” Syl said. The words were more of a mental impression\nthan actual sound.\n“We’re near Kholinar then,” he said.\n“She clearly likes the sky,” Syl said, glancing at Shallan. “A natural. She\nalmost seems like a spren, and I consider that high praise.”\nHe sighed, and did not look at Shallan.\n“Come on…” Syl said, zipping around to his other side. “You need to be\nwith people to be happy, Kaladin. I know you do.”\n“I have my bridge crew,” he muttered, voice lost to the winds—but Syl\nwould be able to hear, as he could hear her.\n“Not the same. And you know it.”\n“She brought her handmaid on a scouting mission. She couldn’t go a\nweek without someone to do her hair. You think I’d be interested in that?”\n“Think?” Syl said. She took the shape of a tiny young woman in a girlish\ndress, flying through the sky before him. “I know. Don’t think I don’t spot\nyou stealing looks.” She smirked.\n“Time to stop so we don’t overshoot Kholinar,” Kaladin said. “Go tell\nSkar and Drehy.”\nKaladin took his charges one at a time, canceling their Lashing forward,\nreplacing it with a half Lashing upward. There was a strange effect to the\nLashings that frustrated Sigzil’s scientific attempts at terminology. All of his\nnumbers had assumed that once Lashed, a person would be under the\ninfluence of both the ground and the Lashing.\nThat wasn’t the case. Once you used a Basic Lashing on someone, their\nbody completely forgot about the pull of the ground, and they fell in the\ndirection you indicated. Partial Lashings worked by making part of the\nperson’s weight forget the ground, though the rest continued to be pulled\ndownward. So a half Lashing upward made a person weightless.\nKaladin situated the groups so he could speak to the king, Adolin, and\nShallan. His bridgemen and Shallan’s attendants hovered a short distance\noff. Even Sigzil’s new explanations had trouble accounting for everything\nthat Kaladin did. He’d somehow made a kind of … channel around the\ngroup, like in a river. A current, sweeping them along, keeping them closer\ntogether.\n“It really is beautiful,” Shallan said, surveying the storm, which\nblanketed everything but the tips of some very distant peaks to their left.\nProbably the Sunmaker Mountains. “Like mixing paint—if dark paint could\nsomehow spawn new colors and light within its swirls.”\n“So long as I can continue to watch it from a safe distance,” Adolin said.\nHe held Kaladin’s arm to keep from drifting away.\n“We’re close to Kholinar,” Kaladin said. “Which is good, as we’re\ngetting near the back edge of the storm, and I’ll soon lose access to its\nStormlight.”"

Gone forever.” She glanced at Kaladin. “No\nwisecracks about missing boots?”\n“I couldn’t think of anything funny.” He hesitated. “Though that hasn’t\never stopped you.”\nShallan grinned. “Have you ever considered, bridgeman, that bad art\ndoes more for the world than good art? Artists spend more of their lives\nmaking bad practice pieces than they do masterworks, particularly at the\nstart. And even when an artist becomes a master, some pieces don’t work\nout. Still others are somehow just wrong until the last stroke.\n“You learn more from bad art than you do from good art, as your\nmistakes are more important than your successes. Plus, good art usually\nevokes the same emotions in people—most good art is the same kind of\ngood. But bad pieces can each be bad in their own unique way. So I’m glad\nwe have bad art, and I’m sure the Almighty agrees.”\n“All this,” Adolin said, amused, “to justify your sense of humor,\nShallan?”\n“My sense of humor? No, I’m merely trying to justify the creation of\nCaptain Kaladin.”\nIgnoring her, Kaladin squinted eastward. The clouds behind them were\nlightening from deep, brooding black and grey to a more general blandness,\nthe color of Rock’s morning mush. The storm was near to ending; what\narrived with a fanfare ended with an extended sigh, gales giving way to\npeaceful rain.\n“Drehy, Skar,” Kaladin called. “Keep everyone in the air. I’m going to\ngo scout below.”\nThe two gave him salutes, and Kaladin dropped through the clouds,\nwhich—from within—looked like dirty fog. Kaladin came out crusted in\nfrost, and rain began pelting him, but it was growing weak. Thunder\nrumbled softly above.\nEnough light seeped through the clouds for him to survey the landscape.\nIndeed, the city was close, and it was majestic, but he forced himself to look\nfor enemies before marveling. He noted a broad plain before the city—a\nkilling field kept free of trees or large boulders, so that neither could offer\ncover to an invading army. That was empty, which wasn’t unexpected.\nThe question was who held the city—Voidbringers or humans? He\ncautiously descended. The place glowed with a sprinkling of Stormlight\nfrom cages left out in the storm to recharge the gems. And … yes, from\nguard posts flew Alethi flags, raised now that the worst of the storm had\npassed.\nKaladin let out a relieved sigh.

They were mere foundations of brick and mortar for now. During\nthe times between storms, they were likely guarded—and built up—by\nlarge enemy forces.\nHe finally let himself stare at Kholinar. He knew it was coming,\ninevitable as a budding yawn; he couldn’t keep it down forever. First assess\nthe area for danger, get the lay of the land.\nThen gawk.\nStorms, that city was beautiful.\nHe’d flown high above it once in a half dream where he’d seen the\nStormfather. That hadn’t affected him the way it did to float here, looking\nover the vast metropolis. He’d seen proper cities now—the warcamps\ntogether were probably larger than Kholinar—so it wasn’t the size that\namazed him, really, but the variety. He was accustomed to functional\nbunkers, not stone buildings of many shapes and roofing styles.\nKholinar’s defining feature, of course, was the windblades: curious rock\nformations that rose from the stone like the fins of some giant creature\nmostly hidden beneath the surface. The large curves of stone glittered with\nred, white, and orange strata, their hues deepened by the rain. He hadn’t\nrealized that the city walls were partially constructed on the tops of the\nouter windblades. There, the lower sections of the walls literally sprouted\nfrom the ground, while men had built fortifications atop them, evening out\nthe heights and filling spaces between the curves.\nTowering over the northern side of the city was the palace complex,\nwhich rose high and confident, as if in defiance of the storms. The palace\nwas like a little city unto itself, with bright columns, rotundas, and turrets.\nAnd something was very, very wrong with it.\nA cloud hung over the palace, a darkness that—at first glance—seemed\nlike nothing more than a trick of the light. Yet the feeling of wrongness\npersisted, and seemed strongest around a portion at the east of the palace\ncomplex. This flat, raised plaza was filled with small buildings. The palace\nmonastery.\nThe Oathgate platform.\nKaladin narrowed his eyes, then Lashed himself back upward, passing\ninto the clouds. He’d probably let himself gape for too long—he didn’t\nwant to start talk of a glowing person in the sky.\nStill … that city. In Kaladin’s heart still lived a country boy who had\ndreamed of seeing the world.\n“Did you see that darkness around the palace?” Kaladin asked Syl.\n“Yeah,” she whispered. “Something’s very wrong.”\nKaladin emerged from the clouds and found that his crew had drifted off\nto the west in the breeze. He Lashed himself toward them, and noticed—for\nthe first time—that his Stormlight was no longer being renewed by the\nstorm.\nDrehy and Skar looked visibly relieved when he arrived. “Kal—” Skar\nstarted.\n“I know.

Captain, take us down.”\n“Your Majesty,” Kaladin said. “If we drop from the sky like this, the\nenemy scouts will see us entering.”\n“So?” Elhokar said. “The need for subterfuge was predicated on a fear\nthat we might have to sneak in. If our forces still hold the city, we can\nmarch up to the palace, assert command, and activate the Oathgate.”\nKaladin hesitated. “Your Majesty, something is … wrong with the\npalace. It looks dark, and Syl saw it too. I advise caution.”\n“My wife and child are inside,” Elhokar said. “They might be in danger.”\nYou didn’t seem to worry much about them during six years away at war,\nKaladin thought.\n“Let’s go down anyway,” the king said. “We want to get to the Oathgate\nas soon as possible…” He trailed off, looking from Kaladin to Shallan, to\nAdolin. “Don’t we?”\n“I advise caution,” Kaladin repeated.\n“The bridgeman isn’t the jumpy type, Your Majesty,” Adolin said. “We\ndon’t know what’s going on in the city, or what happened since the reports\nof chaos and a revolt. Caution sounds good to me.”\n“Very well,” Elhokar said. “This is why I brought the Lightweaver. What\ndo you recommend, Brightness?”\n“Let’s land outside the city,” Shallan said. “Far enough away that the\nglow of Stormlight doesn’t give us away. We can use illusions to sneak in\nand find out what is going on without revealing ourselves.”\n“Very well,” Elhokar said, nodding curtly. “Do as she suggests, Captain.”\n61. Nightmare Made Manifest\nWe can record any secret we wish, and leave it here? How do we know\nthat they’ll be discovered? Well, I don’t care. Record that then.\n—From drawer 2-3, smokestone\nThe enemy army was letting refugees approach the city.\nAt first, this surprised Kaladin. Wasn’t the point of a siege to prevent\npeople from getting in? And yet, a constant stream of people was allowed to\napproach Kholinar. The gates stood closed against an army invasion, but the\nside doors—which were still large—were wide open.\nKaladin handed the spyglass to Adolin. They’d landed in an\ninconspicuous location, then hiked back to the city on foot—but it had been\ndark by the time they’d arrived. They’d decided to spend the night outside\nthe city, hidden by one of Shallan’s illusions. Impressively, her\nLightweaving had lasted all night on very little Stormlight.\nNow that morning had arrived, they were surveying the city, which was\nmaybe a mile away. From the outside, their hideout would seem like merely\nanother knob of stone ground. Shallan couldn’t make it transparent from\nonly one side, so they had to see out using a slit that—if someone walked\nclose by—would be visible."

Shallan couldn’t make it transparent from\nonly one side, so they had to see out using a slit that—if someone walked\nclose by—would be visible.\nThe illusion felt like a cave—except for the fact that wind and rain went\nright through it. The king and Shallan had grumbled all morning,\ncomplaining of a damp, cold night. Kaladin and his men had slept like\nstones. There were advantages to having lived through Bridge Four.\n“They let refugees in so they can drain the city’s resources,” Adolin said,\nwatching through the spyglass. “A solid tactic.”\n“Brightness Shallan,” Elhokar said, accepting the spyglass from Adolin,\n“you can give us each illusions, right? We can pretend to be refugees and\nenter the city easily.”\nShallan nodded absently. She sat sketching near a shaft of light pouring\nthrough a small hole in the ceiling.\nAdolin turned his spyglass toward the palace, the top of which\nsurmounted the city in the distance. The day was perfectly sunny, bright,\nand crisp, with only a hint of moisture in the air from the highstorm the day\nbefore. There wasn’t a cloud in the sky.\nBut somehow, the palace was still in shadow.\n“What could it be?” Adolin said, lowering his spyglass.\n“One of them,” Shallan whispered. “The Unmade.”\nKaladin looked back at her. She’d sketched the palace, but it was\ntwisted, with odd angles and distorted walls.\nElhokar studied the palace. “You were right to recommend caution,\nWindrunner. My instinct is still to rush in. That’s wrong, isn’t it? I must be\nprudent and careful.”\nThey gave Shallan time to finish sketches—she claimed to need them for\ncomplex illusions. Eventually she stood, flipping pages in her sketchpad.\n“All right. Most of us won’t need disguises, as nobody will recognize me or\nmy attendants. Same goes for Kaladin’s men, I assume.”\n“If someone does recognize me,” Skar said, “it won’t cause any\nproblems. Nobody here knows what happened to me at the Shattered\nPlains.” Drehy nodded.\n“All right,” Shallan said, turning to Kaladin and Adolin. “You two will\nget new faces and clothing, making you into old men.”\n“I don’t need a disguise,” Kaladin said. “I—”\n“You spent time with those parshmen earlier in the month,” Shallan said.\n“Best to be safe. Besides, you scowl at everyone like an old man anyway.\nYou’ll be a great fit.”\nKaladin glowered at her.\n“Perfect! Keep it up.” Shallan stepped over and breathed out, and\nStormlight wreathed him. He felt he should be able to take it in, use it—but\nit resisted him. It was a strange sensation, as if he’d found a glowing coal\nthat gave off no heat.\nThe Stormlight vanished and he held up a hand, which now appeared\nwizened. His uniform coat had been changed to a homespun brown jacket.\nHe touched his face, but didn’t feel anything different.\nAdolin pointed at him. “Shallan, that is positively wretched. I’m\nimpressed.”\n“What?” Kaladin looked at his men. Drehy winced."

He resolved into a sturdy, handsome\nman in his sixties, with dark brown skin, white hair, and a lean figure. His\nclothing was no longer ornate, but in good repair. He looked like the kind of\nold rogue you’d find in a pub, with handy tales about the brilliant things\nhe’d done in his youth. The kind of man that made women think they\npreferred older men, when in reality they just preferred him.\n“Oh, now that’s unfair,” Kaladin said.\n“If I stretch a lie too far, people are more likely to be suspicious,”\nShallan said lightly, then stepped over to the king. “Your Majesty, you’re\ngoing to be a woman.”\n“Fine,” Elhokar said.\nKaladin started. He’d have expected an objection. Judging by the way\nthat Shallan seemed to stifle a quip, she’d been expecting one too.\n“You see,” she said instead, “I don’t think you can keep from carrying\nyourself like a king, so I figure that if you look like a highborn lighteyed\nwoman, it’s less likely that you’ll be memorable to the guards who—”\n“I said it was fine, Lightweaver,” Elhokar said. “We mustn’t waste time.\nMy city and nation are in peril.”\nShallan breathed out again, and the king was transfigured into a tall,\nstately Alethi woman with features reminiscent of Jasnah’s. Kaladin nodded\nappreciatively. Shallan was right; there was something about the way\nElhokar held himself that bespoke nobility. This was an excellent way to\ndeflect people who might wonder who he was.\nAs they gathered their packs, Syl zipped into the enclosure. She took the\nshape of a young woman and flitted up to Kaladin, then stepped back in the\nair—aghast.\n“Oh!” she said. “Wow!”\nKaladin glared at Shallan. “What did you do to me?”\n“Oh, don’t be that way,” she said. “This will only highlight your\nexcellent personality.”\nDon’t let her get to you, Kaladin thought. She wants to get to you. He\nhefted his pack. It didn’t matter what he looked like; it was only an illusion.\nBut what had she done?\nHe led the way out of their enclosure, and they fell into a line. The rock\nillusion melted away behind them. Kaladin’s men had brought generic blue\nuniforms with no insignias. They could have belonged to any minor house\nguard within the Kholin princedom. Shallan’s two had on generic brown\nuniforms, and with Elhokar wearing the dress of a lighteyed woman, they\nactually looked like a real refugee group. Elhokar would be seen as a\nbrightlady who had fled—without even a palanquin or carriage—before the\nenemy’s advance. She’d brought a few guards, some servants, and Shallan\nas her young ward.

And Kaladin was her … what?\nStorms. “Syl,” he growled, “could I summon you not as a sword, but as a\nflat, shiny piece of metal?”\n“A mirror?” she asked, flying along beside him. “Hmmm.…”\n“Not sure if it’s possible?”\n“Not sure if it’s dignified.”\n“Dignified? Since when have you cared about dignity?”\n“I’m not to be toyed with. I’m a majestic weapon to be used only in\nmajestic ways.” She hummed to herself and flitted away. Before he could\ncall her back to complain, Elhokar caught up to him.\n“Slow down, Captain,” the king said. Even his voice had changed to\nsound womanly. “You’ll outpace us.”\nReluctantly, Kaladin slowed. Elhokar didn’t show what he thought of\nKaladin’s face; the king kept his eyes forward. He never did think much\nabout other people, so that was normal.\n“They call it the Windrunner, you know,” the king said softly. It took\nKaladin a moment to realize that Elhokar was referring to the river that ran\npast Kholinar. Their path took them across it on a wide stone bridge. “The\nAlethi lighteyes rule because of you. Your order was prominent here, in\nwhat was then Alethela.”\n“I—”\n“Our quest is vital,” Elhokar continued. “We can’t afford to let this city\nfall. We cannot afford mistakes.”\n“I assure you, Your Majesty,” Kaladin said, “I don’t intend to make\nmistakes.”\nElhokar glanced at him, and for a moment Kaladin felt he could see the\nreal king. Not because the illusion was failing, but because of the way\nElhokar’s lips tightened, his brow creased, and his gaze became so intense.\n“I wasn’t speaking of you, Captain,” the king said quietly. “I was\nreferring to my own limitations. When I fail this city, I want to make sure\nyou are there to protect it.”\nKaladin looked away, ashamed. Had he really just been thinking of how\nselfish this man was? “Your Majesty…”\n“No,” Elhokar said firmly. “This is a time to be realistic. A king must do\nwhatever he can for the good of his people, and my judgment has proven …\ndeficient. Anything I have ‘accomplished’ in life has been handed to me by\nmy father or my uncle. You are here, Captain, to succeed when I fail.\nRemember that. Open the Oathgate, see that my wife and child are ushered\nthrough it to safety, and return with an army to reinforce this city.”\n“I’ll do my best, Your Majesty.”\n“No,” Elhokar said. “You’ll do what I command. Be extraordinary,\nCaptain. Nothing else will suffice.”\nStorms. How was it that Elhokar could give a compliment and yet be\ninsulting at the same time? Kaladin felt a weight at hearing words that\nreminded him of his days in Amaram’s army, back when people had first\nstarted talking about him, expecting things from him.\nThose rumors had become a challenge, creating for everyone the notion\nof a man who was like Kaladin, but at the same time greater than he could"

He’d used that fictional man, relied upon him, to equip his team\nand to get soldiers transferred to his squad. Without it, he’d never have met\nTarah. It was useful to have a reputation, so long as it didn’t crush you.\nThe king dropped back farther into the line. They crossed the killing field\nunder the watchful eyes of bowmen atop the wall. It made Kaladin’s back\nitch, though they were Alethi soldiers. He tried to ignore it by focusing on\nstudying the wall as they stepped into its shadow.\nThose strata, he thought, remind me of the tunnels in Urithiru. Could\nthere be some connection?\nHe glanced over his shoulder as Adolin came up to him. The disguised\nprince winced as he looked at Kaladin.\n“Hey,” Adolin said. “Um … wow. That’s really distracting.”\nStorming woman. “What do you want?”\n“I’ve been thinking,” Adolin said. “We’ll want a place inside the city to\nhole up, right? We can’t follow either of our original plans—we can’t\nsimply stride up to the palace, but we don’t want to assault it either. Not\nuntil we’ve done a little scouting.”\nKaladin nodded. He hated the prospect of spending too much time in\nKholinar. None of the other bridgemen had gotten far enough to swear the\nSecond Ideal, so Bridge Four would be unable to practice with their powers\nuntil he returned. At the same time, the shadowed palace was disquieting.\nThey did need to spend a few days gathering intelligence.\n“Agreed,” Kaladin said. “Do you have any ideas for where we can set\nup?”\n“I’ve got just the place. Run by people I trust, and close enough to the\npalace to do some scouting, but far enough away not to get caught in …\nwhatever is going on there. Hopefully.” He looked concerned.\n“What was it like?” Kaladin asked. “The thing beneath the tower that\nyou and Shallan fought?”\n“Shallan has pictures. You should ask her.”\n“I’ve seen them in the reports Dalinar’s scribes gave me,” Kaladin said.\n“What was it like?”\nAdolin turned his blue eyes back to their path. The illusion was so real, it\nwas hard to believe it was actually him—but he did walk the same way,\nwith that inborn confidence only a lighteyes had.\n“It was … wrong,” Adolin finally said. “Haunting. A nightmare made\nmanifest.”\n“Kind of like my face?” Kaladin asked.\nAdolin glanced at him, then grinned. “Fortunately, Shallan covered it up\nfor you with that illusion.”\nKaladin found himself smiling. The way Adolin said things like that\nmade it clear he was joking—and not only at your expense. Adolin made\nyou want to laugh with him.\nThey drew close to the entrance. Though dwarfed by the main city gates,\nthe side doors were wide enough to admit a cart. Unfortunately, the entrance\nwas blocked by soldiers, and a crowd was accumulating, angerspren boiling\non the ground around them. The refugees shook their fists and shouted at\nbeing barred entrance."

The refugees shook their fists and shouted at\nbeing barred entrance.\nThey’d been letting people in earlier. What was happening? Kaladin\nglanced at Adolin, then gestured with his chin. “Check it out?”\n“We’ll go have a look,” Adolin said, turning toward the others of their\ngroup. “Wait here.”\nSkar and Drehy stopped, but Elhokar followed as Kaladin and Adolin\ncontinued forward—and so did Shallan. Her servants hesitated briefly, then\ntrailed after her. Storms, the command structure in this expedition was\ngoing to be a nightmare.\nElhokar imperiously marched forward and barked at people to move out\nof his way. Reluctantly, they did—a woman with his bearing was not\nsomeone to cross. Kaladin exchanged a wearied glance with Adolin, then\nboth fell in beside the king.\n“I demand entry,” Elhokar said, reaching the front of the crowd—which\nhad swelled to some fifty or sixty people, with more steadily arriving.\nThe small group of guards looked over Elhokar, and their captain spoke.\n“How many fighting men can you provide for the city defense?”\n“None,” Elhokar snapped. “They are my personal guard.”\n“Then, Brightness, you should march them personally on to the south\nand try another city.”\n“Where?” Elhokar demanded, the sentiment echoed by many in the\ncrowd. “There are monsters everywhere, Captain.”\n“Word is that there are fewer to the south,” the soldier said, pointing.\n“Regardless, Kholinar is full to bursting. You won’t find sanctuary here.\nTrust me. Move on. The city—”\n“Who is your superior?” Elhokar cut in.\n“I serve Highmarshal Azure, of the Wall Guard.”\n“Highmarshal Azure? I’ve never heard of such a man. Do these people\nlook like they can walk farther? I command you to let us enter the city.”\n“I’m under orders to only let a set number in each day,” the guard said\nwith a sigh. Kaladin recognized that sense of exasperation; Elhokar could\nbring it out in the most patient of guards. “We’ve passed the limit. You’ll\nneed to wait until tomorrow.”\nPeople growled, and more angerspren appeared around them.\n“It’s not that we’re callous,” the guard captain called. “Will you just\nlisten? The city is low on food, and we’re running out of room in\nstormshelters. Every person we add strains our resources further! But the\nmonsters are focused here; if you flee to the south, you can take refuge\nthere, maybe even get to Jah Keved.”\n“Unacceptable!” Elhokar said. “You’ve gotten these inane orders from\nthat Azure fellow. Who commands him?”\n“The highmarshal has no commander.”\n“What?” Elhokar demanded. “What of Queen Aesudan?”\nThe guard just shook his head. “Look, are those two men yours?” He\npointed at Drehy and Skar, still standing near the back of the crowd. “They\nlook like good soldiers. If you assign them to the Wall Guard, I’ll give you\nimmediate entry, and we’ll see that you get a grain ration.”"

Storms, but Kaladin empathized with\nthe poor man.\nSyl suddenly grew alert, zipping into the sky as a ribbon of light.\nKaladin immediately stopped paying attention to Elhokar and the guards.\nHe searched the sky until he saw figures flying toward the wall in a V\nformation. There were at least twenty Voidbringers, each trailing a plume of\ndark energy.\nAbove, soldiers began to scream. The urgent call of drums followed, and\nthe guard captain cursed in response. He and his men charged in through the\nopen doors, then ran toward the nearest stairs leading up to the wall walk.\n“In!” Adolin said as other refugees surged forward. He grabbed the king\nand towed him inside.\nKaladin fought against the press, refusing to be pushed into the city. He\ninstead craned his neck to look upward, watching the Voidbringers hit the\nwall. Kaladin’s angle at the base was terrible for making sense of the action\ndirectly above.\nA few men got tossed off the wall farther along. Kaladin took a step\ntoward them, but before he could do anything, they crashed to the ground\nwith strikingly loud impacts. Storms! He was shoved farther toward the city\nby the crowd, and barely restrained himself from drawing in Stormlight.\nSteady, he told himself. The point is to get in without being seen. You\nwould ruin that by flying to the defense of the city?\nBut he was supposed to protect.\n“Kaladin,” Adolin called, fighting back through the crowd to where\nKaladin stood right outside. “Come on.”\n“They’re dominating that wall, Adolin. We should go help.”\n“Help how?” Adolin said. He leaned in, speaking softly. “Summon\nShardblades and swing them wildly in the air, like a farmer chasing\nskyeels? This is merely a raid to test our defenses. It’s not a full-on assault.”\nKaladin drew in a breath, then let Adolin pull him into the city. “Two\ndozen of the Fused. They could take this city with ease.”\n“Not alone,” Adolin said. “Everyone knows that Shardbearers can’t hold\nground—it should be the same for Radiants and those Fused. You need\nsoldiers to take a city. Let’s move.”\nThey went inside and met with the others, then moved away from the\nwalls and gates. Kaladin tried to close his ears to the distant shouts of the\nsoldiers. As Adolin had guessed, the raid ended as abruptly as it had begun,\nthe Fused soaring away from the wall after only a few minutes of fighting.\nKaladin sighed, watching them go, then steeled himself and followed with\nthe rest as Adolin led them down a wide thoroughfare.\nKholinar was both more impressive and more depressing from the\ninside.

And storms, the guard at the wall had not been\nexaggerating. People crowded every street. Kholinar didn’t have many\nalleyways; the stone buildings were built right up against each other in long\nrows. But people sat in the gutters, clinging to blankets and meager\npossessions. Too many doors were closed; often on nice days like this,\npeople in the warcamps would leave the thick stormdoors and shutters open\nto the breeze. Not here. They were locked up tightly, for fear of being\noverwhelmed by refugees.\nShallan’s soldiers pulled tight around her, hands carefully on their\npockets. They seemed familiar with the underbelly of city life. Fortunately,\nshe’d accepted Kaladin’s pointed suggestion and hadn’t brought Gaz.\nWhere are the patrols? Kaladin thought as they walked through curving\nstreets, up and down slopes. With all these people clogging the streets,\nsurely they needed as many men as possible keeping the peace.\nHe didn’t see anything until they passed out of the section of city nearest\nthe gates and entered a more wealthy area. This part was dominated by\nlarger homes, with grounds marked by iron fences anchored into the stone\nwith hardened crem. Behind those were guards, but the streets were devoid\nof anything similar.\nKaladin felt the gaze of the refugees. The wondering. Was it worth\nrobbing him? Did it matter? Did they have food? Fortunately, the spears\nSkar and Drehy carried—along with the cudgels held by Shallan’s two men\n—seemed enough to deter any would-be robbers.\nKaladin quickened his pace to catch up to Adolin at the front of their\nlittle group. “Is this safehouse of yours close? I don’t like the feeling on\nthese streets.”\n“It’s a way yet,” Adolin said. “But I agree. Storms, I should have brought\na side sword. Who knew I’d be worried about summoning my Blade?”\n“Why can’t Shardbearers hold a city?” Kaladin asked.\n“Basic military theory,” Adolin said. “Shardbearers do a great job killing\npeople—but what are they going to do against the population of an entire\ncity? Murder everyone who disobeys? They’d get overwhelmed, Shards or\nnot. Those flying Voidbringers will need to bring in the entire army to take\nthe city. But first they’ll test the walls, maybe weaken the defenses.”\nKaladin nodded. He liked to think he knew a great deal about warfare,\nbut the truth was, he didn’t have the training of a man like Adolin. He’d\nparticipated in wars, but he’d never run any.\nThe farther they got from the walls, the better things seemed to be in the\ncity—fewer refugees, more sense of order. They passed a market that was\nactually open, and inside he finally spotted a policing force: a tight group of\nmen wearing unfamiliar colors.\nThis area would have looked nice, under other circumstances.

Cultivated trees—\nwhich rarely pulled in their leaves—sprouted in front of many of the\nbuildings, gripping the ground with thick roots that melded into the stone.\nRefugees huddled in family groups. Here, the buildings were built in\nlarge square layouts, with windows facing inward and courtyards at the\ncenters. People crowded into these, turning them into improvised shelters.\nFortunately, Kaladin saw no obvious starvation, so the city’s food stores\nhadn’t given out yet.\n“Did you see that?” Shallan asked softly, joining him.\n“What?” Kaladin asked, looking over his shoulder.\n“Performers in that market over there, dressed in very odd clothing.”\nShallan frowned, pointing down an intersecting street as they passed.\n“There’s another one.”\nIt was a man dressed all in white, with strips of cloth that streamed and\nfluttered as he moved. Head down, he stood on a street corner, leaping back\nand forth from one position to another. When he looked up and met\nKaladin’s eyes, he was the first stranger that day who didn’t immediately\nlook away.\nKaladin watched until a chull pulling a wagon of storm refuse blocked\nhis view. Then, ahead of them, people started clearing the street.\n“To the side,” Elhokar said. “I’m curious about what this could be.”\nThey joined the crowds pressed up against the buildings, Kaladin\nshoving his hands in his pack to protect the large number of spheres he had\ntucked away in a black purse there. Soon, a strange procession came\nmarching down the center of the street. These men and women were also\ndressed like performers—their clothes augmented with brightly colored\nstrips of red, blue, or green fabric. They walked past, calling out nonsense\nphrases. Words Kaladin knew, but which didn’t belong together.\n“What in Damnation is happening in this city?” Adolin muttered.\n“This isn’t normal?” Kaladin whispered.\n“We have buskers and street performers, but nothing like this. Storms.\nWhat are they?”\n“Spren,” Shallan whispered. “They’re imitating spren. Look, those are\nlike flamespren, and the ones of white and blue with the flowing ribbons—\nwindspren. Emotion spren too. There’s pain, that’s fear, anticipation…”\n“So it’s a parade,” Kaladin said, frowning. “But nobody is having any\nfun.”\nThe heads of spectators bowed, and people murmured or … prayed?\nNearby an Alethi refugee—wrapped in rags and holding a sniveling baby in\nher arms—leaned against a building. A burst of exhaustionspren appeared\nabove her, like jets of dust rising in the air. Only these were bright red\ninstead of the normal brown, and seemed distorted.\n“This is wrong, wrong, wrong,” Syl said from Kaladin’s shoulder.\n“Oh … oh, that spren is from him, Kaladin.”\nShallan watched the rising not-exhaustionspren with widening eyes. She\ntook Adolin by the arm. “Keep us moving,” she hissed.\nHe started pushing through the crowd toward a corner where they could\ncut away from the strange procession.

Elhokar\nhad been fishing in his pocket, perhaps for a sphere to give the exhausted\nwoman. Storms! In the middle of the crowd!\n“Not far now,” Adolin said once they had breathing room on the side\nstreet. “Follow me.”\nHe led them to a small archway, where the buildings had been built\naround a shared courtyard garden. Of course, refugees had taken shelter\nthere, many of them huddled in blanket tents that were still wet from the\nstorm the day before. Lifespren bobbed among the plants.\nAdolin carefully wound his way through all the people to get to the door\nhe wanted, and then knocked. It was the back door, facing the courtyard\ninstead of the street. Was this a rich person’s winehouse, perhaps? It seemed\nmore like a home though.\nAdolin knocked again, looking worried. Kaladin stepped up beside him,\nthen froze. On the door was a shiny steel plate with engraved numbers. In it,\nhe could see his reflection.\n“Almighty above,” Kaladin said, poking at the scars and bulges on his\nface, some with open sores. Fake teeth jutted from his mouth, and one eye\nwas higher in his head than the other. His hair grew out in patches, and his\nnose was tiny. “What did you do to me, woman?”\n“I’ve recently learned,” Shallan said, “that a good disguise can be\nmemorable, so long as it makes you memorable for the wrong reason. You,\nCaptain, have a way of sticking in people’s heads, and I worried you would\ndo so no matter what face you wore. So I enveloped it with something even\nmore memorable.”\n“I look like some kind of hideous spren.”\n“Hey!” Syl said.\nThe door finally opened, revealing a short, matronly Thaylen woman in\nan apron and vest. Behind her stood a burly man with a white beard, cut\nafter the Horneater style.\n“What?” she said. “Who are you?”\n“Oh!” Adolin said. “Shallan, I’ll need…”\nShallan rubbed his face with a towel from her pack, as if to remove\nmakeup—covering the transformation as his face became his own again.\nAdolin grinned at the woman, and her jaw dropped.\n“Prince Adolin?” she said. “Hurry, hurry. Get in here. It’s not safe\noutside!”\nShe ushered them in and quickly shut the door. Kaladin blinked at the\nsphere-lit chamber, its walls lined with bolts of cloth and dummies with\nhalf-finished coats on them.\n“What is this place?” Kaladin asked.\n“Well, I figured we’d want someplace safe,” Adolin said. “We’d need to\nstay with someone I’d trust with my life, or more.” He looked at Kaladin,\nthen gestured toward the woman. “So I brought us to my tailor.”\n62. Research\nI wish to submit my formal protest at the idea of abandoning the tower."

Research\nI wish to submit my formal protest at the idea of abandoning the tower.\nThis is an extreme step, taken brashly.\n—From drawer 2-22, smokestone\nSecrets.\nThis city was brimming with them. It was stuffed with them, so tightly\nthey couldn’t help but ooze out.\nThe only thing for Shallan to do, then, was punch herself in the face.\nThat was harder than it seemed. She always flinched. Come on, she\nthought, making a fist. With eyes squeezed shut, she braced herself, then\nsmacked her freehand into the side of her head.\nIt barely hurt; she simply wasn’t capable of hitting herself hard enough.\nMaybe she could get Adolin to do it for her. He was in the back workroom\nof the tailor’s shop. Shallan had excused herself to step into the front\nshowroom, as she figured the others would react poorly to her trying to\nactively attract a painspren.\nShe could hear their voices as they interrogated the polite tailor. “It\nstarted with the riots, Your Majesty,” the woman said in response to a\nquestion from Elhokar. “Or maybe before, with the … Well, it’s\ncomplicated. Oh, I can’t believe that you’re here. I’ve had Passion for\nsomething to happen, true, but to finally … I mean…”\n“Take a deep breath, Yokska,” Adolin said gently. Even his voice was\nadorable. “Once you’ve taken all this in, we can continue.”\nSecrets, Shallan thought. Secrets caused all of this.\nShallan peeked into the other room. The king, Adolin, Yokska the tailor,\nand Kaladin sat inside, all wearing their own faces again. They’d sent\nKaladin’s men—along with Red, Ishnah, and Vathah—off with the tailor’s\nhousemaid to prepare the upper rooms and attic to accommodate guests.\nYokska and her husband would be sleeping on pallets in the back room\nhere; naturally, Elhokar had been given their room. Right now, the small\ngroup had arranged a circle of wooden chairs under the heedless watch of\ntailor’s dummies wearing a variety of half-finished coats.\nSimilar finished coats were displayed around the showroom. They were\nmade in bright colors—even brighter than the Alethi wore at the Shattered\nPlains—with gold or silver thread, shiny buttons, and elaborate embroidery\non the large pockets. The coats didn’t close at the front except for a few\nbuttons right below the collar, while the sides flared out, then split into tails\nat the back.\n“It was the execution of the ardent, Brightlord,” Yokska said. “The queen\nhad her hanged, and … Oh! It was so gruesome. Blessed Passion, Your\nMajesty. I don’t want to speak ill of your wife! She must not have realized\n—”\n“Just tell us,” Elhokar said. “Do not fear reprisal. I must know what the\ncity’s people think.”\nYokska trembled. She was a small, plump woman who wore her long\nThaylen eyebrows curled in twin ringlets, and was probably very\nfashionable in that skirt and blouse. Shallan lingered in the doorway,"

Shallan lingered in the doorway,\ncurious as to what the tailor had to say.\n“Well,” Yokska continued, “during the riots, the queen … the queen\nbasically vanished. We’d get proclamations from her, now and then, but\nthey often didn’t make much sense. It all went wrong at the ardent’s death.\nThe city was already in an uproar.… She wrote such awful things, Your\nMajesty. About the state of the monarchy, and the queen’s faith and…”\n“And Aesudan condemned her to death,” Elhokar said. Lit by only a few\nspheres at the center of their circle, his face was half shadowed. It was a\nmost intriguing effect, and Shallan took a Memory for later sketching.\n“Yes, Your Majesty.”\n“It was the dark spren, obviously, who gave the actual order,” Elhokar\nsaid. “The dark spren that is controlling the palace. My wife would never be\nso imprudent as to publicly execute an ardent during such parlous times.”\n“Oh! Yes, of course. Dark spren. In the palace.” Yokska sounded relieved\nto have a rationale for not blaming the queen.\nShallan considered, then noticed a pair of fabric scissors on a ledge\nnearby. She snatched them, then ducked back into the showroom. She\npulled her skirt to the side, then stabbed herself in the leg with the scissors.\nThe sharp pain seared up her leg and through her body.\n“Mmmm,” Pattern said. “Destruction. This … this is not normal for you,\nShallan. Too far.”\nShe trembled at the pain. Blood welled from the wound, but she pressed\nher hand against it to limit its spread.\nThere! That had done it. Painspren appeared around her, as if crawling\nout of the ground—like little disembodied hands. They looked skinless,\nmade of sinew. Normally they were bright orange, but these were a sickly\ngreen. And they were also wrong … instead of human hands, these seemed\nto be from some kind of monster—too distorted, with claws jutting from the\nsinew.\nShallan eagerly took a Memory, still holding her havah skirt up to keep it\nfrom the blood.\n“Does that not hurt?” Pattern asked, from where he’d moved onto the\nwall.\n“Of course it does,” Shallan said, her eyes watering. “That was the\npoint.”\n“Mmmm…” He buzzed, worried, but he needn’t have been, as Shallan\nhad what she wanted. Satisfied, she took in a little Stormlight and healed up,\nthen used some cloth from her satchel to wipe the blood from her leg. She\nrinsed her hands and the cloth in the washroom basin. She was surprised at\nthe running water; she hadn’t thought Kholinar had such things.\nShe took out her drawing pad and returned to the back room’s doorway,\nwhere she leaned against the jamb, doing a quick sketch of the strange,\ntwisted painspren. Jasnah would tell her to put down her sketchpad and go\nsit with the others—but Shallan often paid better attention with a sketchpad"

People who didn’t draw never seemed to understand that.\n“Tell us about the palace,” Kaladin said. “The … dark spren, as His\nMajesty put it.”\nYokska nodded. “Oh, yes, Brightlord.”\nShallan glanced up to catch Kaladin’s reaction at being called Brightlord,\nbut he didn’t show one. His illusory disguise was gone—though Shallan\nhad tucked that sketch away, for possible further use. He’d summoned his\nBlade earlier in the morning, and he now had eyes as blue as any she’d\nseen. They hadn’t faded yet.\n“There was that unexpected highstorm,” Yokska continued. “And after\nthat, the weather went insane. The rains started going in fits and starts. But\noh! When that new storm came, the one with the red lightning, it left a\ngloom over the palace. So nasty! Dark times. I suppose … suppose those\nhaven’t ended.”\n“Where were the royal guards?” Elhokar said. “They should have\naugmented the Watch, restored order during the rioting!”\n“The Palace Guard retreated into the palace, Your Majesty,” Yokska said.\n“And she ordered the City Watch to barricade into the barracks. They\neventually moved to the palace on the queen’s orders. They … haven’t been\nseen since.”\nStorms, Shallan thought, continuing her sketch.\n“Oh, I guess I’m jumping about, but I forgot!” Yokska continued. “In the\nmiddle of the rioting, a proclamation came from the queen. Oh, Your\nMajesty. She wanted to execute the city’s parshmen! Well, we all thought\nshe must be—I’m sorry—but we thought she must be mad. Poor things.\nWhat have they ever done? That’s what we thought. We didn’t know.\n“Well, the queen posted criers all over the city, proclaiming the\nparshmen to be Voidbringers. And I must say, about that she was right. Yet\nit was still so strange. She didn’t even seem to notice that half the city was\nrioting!”\n“The dark spren,” Elhokar said, making a fist. “It must be blamed, not\nAesudan.”\n“Were there reports of any strange murders?” Adolin asked. “Murders, or\nviolence, that came in pairs—a man would die, and then a few days later\nsomeone else would be killed in the exact same way?”\n“No, Brightlord. Nothing … nothing like that, though there were many\nwho were killed.”\nShallan shook her head. It was a different Unmade here; another ancient\nspren of Odium. Religion and lore spoke of them vaguely at best, tending to\nsimplistically conflate them into one evil entity. Navani and Jasnah had\nbegun to research them over the last weeks, but they still didn’t know very\nmuch.\nShe finished her sketch of the painspren, then did one of the\nexhaustionspren they’d seen earlier. She’d managed to glimpse some\nhungerspren around a refugee on their way. Oddly, those didn’t look any\ndifferent. Why?"

Why?\nNeed more information, Shallan thought. More data. What was the most\nembarrassing thing she could think of?\n“Well,” Elhokar said, “though we didn’t order the parshmen executed,\nonly exiled, at least that order seems to have reached Aesudan. She must\nhave been free enough from the control of the dark forces to heed our words\nvia spanreed.”\nOf course, he didn’t mention the logical problems. If the tailor was\ncorrect about the dark spren arriving during the Everstorm, then Aesudan\nhad executed the ardent on her own—as that had happened before.\nLikewise, the order to exile the parshmen would also have come before the\nEverstorm. And who knew if an Unmade could even influence someone like\nthe queen? The spren in Urithiru had mimicked people, not controlled them.\nYokska did seem to be a little scattered in her retelling of events, so\nmaybe Elhokar could be forgiven for mixing up the timeline. Either way,\nShallan needed something embarrassing. When I spilled wine the first time\nFather gave me some at a dinner party. No … no … something more …\n“Oh!” Yokska said. “Your Majesty, you should know. The proclamation\nrequiring the execution of the parshmen … well, a coalition of important\nlighteyes didn’t follow it. Then, after that terrible storm, the queen started\ngiving other orders, so the lighteyes went to meet with her.”\n“Let me guess,” Kaladin said. “They never came back from the palace.”\n“No, Brightlord, they did not.”\nHow about when I woke and faced Jasnah, after I’d almost died, and\nshe’d discovered that I’d betrayed her?\nSurely remembering that event would be enough.\nNo?\nBother.\n“So the parshmen,” Adolin said. “Did they get executed?”\n“No,” Yokska continued. “Like I said, everyone was concerned with the\nriots—save for the servants posting the queen’s orders, I suppose. The Wall\nGuard eventually took action. They restored some measure of order in the\ncity, then rounded up the parshmen and exiled them to the plain outside.\nAnd then…”\n“The Everstorm came,” Shallan said, covertly undoing the button on her\nsafehand sleeve.\nYokska seemed to shrink down in her seat. The others fell silent, which\nprovided the perfect opportunity for Shallan. She took a deep breath, then\nstrolled forward, holding her sketchpad as if distracted. She tripped herself\nover a roll of cloth on the floor, yelped, and tumbled into the center of the\nring of chairs.\nShe ended up sprawled on the floor, skirts up about her waist—and she\nwasn’t even wearing the leggings today. Her safehand bulged out from\nbetween the sleeve buttons, poking into the open right in front of not just\nthe king, but Kaladin and Adolin.\nPerfectly, horribly, incredibly mortifying. She felt a deep blush come on,\nand shamespren dropped around her in a wave. Normally, they took the\nshape of falling red and white flower petals."

Normally, they took the\nshape of falling red and white flower petals.\nThese were like pieces of broken glass.\nThe men, of course, were more distracted by the position she’d gotten\nherself into. She squawked, managed to take a Memory of the shamespren,\nand righted herself, blushing furiously and tucking her hand in her sleeve.\nThat, she thought, might be the craziest thing you’ve ever done. Which is\nsaying a lot.\nShe grabbed her sketchbook and bustled away, passing Yokska’s white-\nbearded husband—Shallan still hadn’t heard him speak a word—standing in\nthe doorway with a tray of wine and tea. Shallan grabbed the darkest cup of\nwine and downed it in a single gulp, feeling the stares of the men on her\nback.\n“Shallan?” Adolin piped up. “Um…”\n“I’mfinethatwasanexperiment,” she said, ducking into the showroom and\nthrowing herself into a seat placed there for customers. Storms, that was\nhumiliating.\nShe could still see partway into the other room. Yokska’s husband\nwalked with his silver tray to the group. He stopped by Yokska—though\nserving the king first would have been the correct protocol—and rested a\nhand on her shoulder. She put her own on his.\nShallan flipped open her sketchpad, and was pleased to see more\nshamespren dropping around her. Still glass. She started a drawing, burying\nherself in it to keep from thinking about what she’d just done.\n“So…” Elhokar said in the next room. “We were talking about the Wall\nGuard. They obeyed the queen’s orders?”\n“Well, that was around the time that the highmarshal appeared. I’ve\nnever seen him either. He doesn’t come down from the wall much. He\nrestored order, so that’s good, but the Wall Guard doesn’t have the numbers\nto police the city and watch the wall—so they’ve taken to watching the wall\nand mostly leaving us to just … survive in here.”\n“Who rules now?” Kaladin asked.\n“Nobody,” Yokska said. “Various highlords … well, they basically seized\nsections of the city. Some argued that the monarchy had fallen, that the king\n—I beg pardon, Your Majesty—had abandoned them. But the real power in\nthe city is the Cult of Moments.”\nShallan looked up from her drawing.\n“Those people we saw on the street?” Adolin asked. “Dressed like\nspren.”\n“Yes, Your Highness,” Yokska said. “I don’t … I don’t know what to tell\nyou. Spren look strange sometimes in the city, and people think it has to do\nwith the queen, the weird storm, the parshmen … They’re scared. Some\nhave started claiming they can see a new world coming, a truly strange new\nworld. One ruled by spren.\n“The Vorin church has declared the Cult of Moments a heresy, but so\nmany of the ardents were in the palace when it grew dark.

And then … and then there are the fabrials.…”\nFabrials. Shallan scrambled to her feet and stuck her head into the next\nroom. “What about the fabrials?”\n“If you use a fabrial,” Yokska said, “of any sort—from spanreed, to\nwarmer, to painrial—you’ll draw them. Screaming yellow spren that ride\nthe wind like streaks of terrible light. They shout and swirl about you. That\nthen usually brings the creatures from the sky, the ones with the loose\nclothing and long spears. They seize the fabrial, and sometimes kill the one\ntrying to use it.”\nStorms … Shallan thought.\n“Have you seen this?” Kaladin asked. “What did the spren look like?\nYou heard them speak?”\nShallan glanced at Yokska, who had sunk down farther in her seat. “I\nthink … maybe we should give the good tailor a break,” Shallan noted.\n“We’ve shown up on her doorstep out of nowhere, stolen her bedroom, and\nare now interrogating her. I’m sure the world won’t fall apart if we let her\nhave a few minutes to drink her tea and recover.”\nThe woman looked at Shallan with an expression of pure gratitude.\n“Storms!” Adolin said, leaping to his feet. “Of course you’re right,\nShallan. Yokska, forgive us, and thank you so much for—”\n“No need for thanks, Your Highness,” she said. “Oh, I did have Passion\nthat help would come. And here it is! But if it pleases the king, a little\nrest … Yes, a little rest would be much appreciated.”\nKaladin grunted and nodded, and Elhokar waved a hand in a way that\nwasn’t quite dismissive. More just … self-absorbed. The three men left\nYokska to rest and joined Shallan in the showroom, where light from the\nsetting sun streamed between the drapes on the front windows. Those would\nnormally be open to show off the tailor’s creations, but no doubt they’d\nlately spent most of their time closed.\nThe four gathered together to digest what they’d discovered. “Well?”\nElhokar asked, speaking—for once—in a soft, thoughtful tone.\n“I want to know what’s going on with the Wall Guard,” Kaladin said.\n“Their leader … none of you have heard of him?”\n“Highmarshal Azure?” Adolin asked. “No. But I’ve been away for years.\nThere are bound to be many officers in the city who were promoted while\nthe rest of us were at war.”\n“Azure might be the one feeding the city,” Kaladin said. “Someone is\nproviding grain. This place would have eaten itself to starvation without\nsome source of food.”\n“At least we’ve learned something,” Shallan said. “We know why the\nspanreeds cut off.”\n“The Voidbringers are trying to isolate the city,” Elhokar said. “They\nlocked down the palace to prevent anyone from using the Oathgate, then cut"

They’re stalling until they can gather a\nlarge enough army.”\nShallan shivered. She held up her sketchpad, showing them the drawings\nshe’d done. “Something is wrong with the city’s spren.”\nThe men nodded as they saw her drawings, though only Kaladin seemed\nto catch what she’d been doing. He looked from the drawing of the\nshamespren to her hand, then raised an eyebrow at her.\nShe shrugged. Well, it worked, didn’t it?\n“Prudence,” the king said softly. “We mustn’t simply rush in and fall to\nwhatever darkness seized the palace, but we also can’t afford to be\ninactive.”\nHe stood up straighter. Shallan had grown so accustomed to seeing\nElhokar as an afterthought—a fault of the way Dalinar, increasingly, had\nbeen treating him. But there was an earnest determination to him, and yes,\neven a regal bearing.\nYes, she thought, taking another Memory of Elhokar. Yes, you are king.\nAnd you can live up to your father’s legacy.\n“We must have a plan,” Elhokar said. “I would gladly hear your wisdom\non this matter, Windrunner. How should we approach this?”\n“Honestly, I’m not sure we should. Your Majesty, it might be best to\ncatch the next highstorm, return to the tower, and report back to Dalinar. He\ncan’t reach us with his visions here, and one of the Unmade could very well\nbe beyond our mission’s parameters.”\n“We don’t need Dalinar’s permission to act,” Elhokar said.\n“I didn’t mean—”\n“What is my uncle going to do, Captain? Dalinar won’t know any more\nthan we will. We either do something about Kholinar ourselves now, or give\nthe city, the Oathgate, and my family up to the enemy.”\nShallan agreed, and even Kaladin nodded slowly.\n“We should at least scout the city and get a better feel for things,” Adolin\nnoted.\n“Yes,” Elhokar said. “A king needs accurate information to act correctly.\nLightweaver, could you take on the look of a messenger woman?”\n“Of course,” Shallan said. “Why?”\n“Let us say I were to dictate a letter to Aesudan,” the king said, “then\nseal it with the royal seal. You could act the part of a messenger who had\ncome personally from the Shattered Plains, traveling through great hardship\nto reach the queen to deliver my words. You could present yourself at the\npalace, and see how the guards there react.”\n“That’s … not a bad idea,” Kaladin said. He sounded surprised.\n“It could be dangerous,” Adolin said. “The guards might bring her into\nthe palace itself.”\n“I’m the only one here who has confronted one of the Unmade directly,”\nShallan said. “I’m most likely to be able to spot their influence, and I have\nthe resources to get out.

The best thing for the city might be to go in\nquietly, activate it, and bring in reinforcements, then decide how to rescue\nmy family. But do reconnaissance only, for now.”\n“And the rest of us just sit around tonight?” Kaladin complained.\n“Waiting and trusting those whom you have empowered is the soul of\nkingship, Windrunner,” Elhokar said. “But I suspect that Brightness Shallan\nwould not object to your company, and I’d rather have someone watching to\nhelp get her out, in an emergency.”\nHe wasn’t exactly correct; she would object to Kaladin’s presence. Veil\nwouldn’t want him looking over her shoulder, and Shallan wouldn’t want\nhim asking questions about that persona.\nHowever, she could find no reasonable objection. “I want to get a feel for\nthe city,” she said, looking to Kaladin. “Have Yokska scribe the king’s\nletter, then meet me. Adolin, is there a good spot we could find each other?”\n“The grand steps up to the palace complex, maybe?” he said. “They’re\nimpossible to miss, and have a little square out in front of them.”\n“Excellent,” Shallan said. “I’ll be wearing a black hat, Kaladin. You can\nwear your own face, I suppose, now that we’re past the Wall Guard. But\nthat slave brand…” She reached up to create an illusion to make it vanish\nfrom his forehead.\nHe caught the hand. “No need. I’ll keep my hair down over it.”\n“It peeks out,” she said.\n“Then let it. In a city full of refugees, nobody is going to care.”\nShe rolled her eyes, but didn’t push. He was probably right. In that\nuniform, he’d probably just be taken for a slave someone bought, then put\nin their house guard. Even though the shash brand was odd.\nThe king went to prepare his letter, and Adolin and Kaladin stayed in the\nshowroom to talk quietly about the Wall Guard. Shallan headed up the\nsteps. Her own room was a smaller one on the second floor.\nInside were Red, and Vathah, and Ishnah the assistant spy, chatting\nquietly.\n“How much did you eavesdrop on?” Shallan asked them.\n“Not much,” Vathah said, thumbing over his shoulder. “We were too\nbusy watching Ishnah ransack the tailor’s bedroom to see if she was hiding\nanything.”\n“Tell me you didn’t make a mess.”\n“No mess,” Ishnah promised. “And nothing to report either. The woman\nmight actually be as boring as she seems. The boys did learn some good\nsearch procedures though.”\nShallan walked past the small guest bed and looked out the window at a\ndaunting view down a city street. So many homes, so many people."

So many homes, so many people.\nIntimidating.\nFortunately, Veil wouldn’t see it that way. There was only one problem.\nI can’t work with this team, she thought, without them eventually asking\nquestions. This Kholinar mission would bring it to a head, as Veil hadn’t\nflown with them.\nShe’d been dreading this. And … kind of … anticipating it? “I need to\ntell them,” she whispered.\n“Mmm,” Pattern said. “It’s good. Progress.”\nRather, she’d been backed into a corner. Still, it had to be done\neventually. She walked to her pack and removed a white coat and a hat,\nwhich folded up on its side. “Some privacy, boys,” she said to Vathah and\nRed. “Veil needs to get dressed.”\nThey looked from the coat to Shallan, then back. Red slapped the side of\nhis head and laughed. “You’re kidding. Well, I feel like an idiot.”\nShe’d expected Vathah to feel betrayed. Instead he nodded—as if this\nmade perfect sense. He saluted her with one finger, then the two men\nretreated.\nIshnah lingered. Shallan had—after some debate—decided to bring the\nwoman. Mraize had vetted her, and in the end, Veil needed the training.\n“You don’t look surprised about this,” Shallan said as she started\nchanging.\n“I was suspicious when Veil … when you told me to go on this mission,”\nshe said. “Then I saw the illusions, and guessed.” She paused. “I had it\nreversed. I thought Brightness Shallan was the persona. But the spy—that’s\nthe false identity.”\n“Wrong,” Shallan said. “They’re both equally false.” Once dressed, she\nflipped through her sketchbook and found a drawing of Lyn in her scouting\nuniform. Perfect. “Go tell Brightlord Kaladin I’m already out and exploring,\nand that he should meet me in about an hour.”\nShe climbed out the window and dropped one story to the ground,\nrelying on her Stormlight to keep her legs from breaking. Then she struck\noff down the street.\n63. Within the Mirror\nI returned to the tower to find squabbling children, instead of proud\nknights. That’s why I hate this place. I’m going to go chart the hidden\nundersea caverns of Aimia; find my maps in Akinah.\n—From drawer 16-16, amethyst\nVeil enjoyed being in a proper city again, even if it was half feral.\nMost cities lived on the very edge of civilization. Everyone talked about\ntowns and villages out in the middle of nowhere as if they were uncivilized,\nbut she’d found people in those places pleasant, even-tempered, and\ncomfortable with their quieter way of life.\nNot in cities. Cities balanced on the edge of sustainability, always one\nstep from starvation. When you pressed so many people together, their\ncultures, ideas, and stenches rubbed off on one another. The result wasn’t\ncivilization. It was contained chaos, pressurized, bottled up so it couldn’t\nescape."

        "text": "cultures, ideas, and stenches rubbed off on one another. The result wasn’t\ncivilization. It was contained chaos, pressurized, bottled up so it couldn’t\nescape.\nThere was a tension to cities. You could breathe it, feel it in every step.\nVeil loved it.\nOnce a few streets from the tailor’s shop, she pulled down the brim of\nher hat and held up a page from her sketchbook as if consulting a map. This\ncovered her as she breathed out Stormlight, transforming her features and\nhair to match those of Veil, instead of Shallan.\nNo spren came, screaming to warn of what she’d done. So Lightweaving\nwas different from using fabrials. She’d been fairly certain it was safe, as\nthey’d worn disguises into the city, but she’d wanted to be away from the\ntailor’s shop in case.\nVeil strolled down the thoroughfare, long coat rippling around her\ncalves. She decided immediately that she liked Kholinar. She liked how the\ncity rolled across its hills, a lumpy blanket of buildings. She liked how it\nsmelled of Horneater spices in one gust of wind, then of Alethi steamed\ncrabs in the next. Admittedly, those probably weren’t proper crabs today,\nbut cremlings.\nThat part she didn’t like. These poor people. Even in this more affluent\narea, she could barely walk a quarter block without having to weave around\nhuddles of people. The midblock courtyards were clogged with what had\nprobably been normal villagers not long ago, but who were now\nimpoverished wretches.\nThere wasn’t much wheeled traffic on the streets. Some palanquins\nringed by guards. No carriages. Life, however, did not stop for a war—or\neven for a second Aharietiam. There was water to draw, clothes to clean.\nWomen’s work mostly, as she could see from the large groups of men\nstanding around. With no one really in charge in the city, who would pay\nmen to work forges? To clean streets or chip crem? Even worse, in a city\nthis size, much of the menial labor would have been done by parshmen.\nNobody would be eager to leap in to take their place.\nThe bridgeboy is right though, Veil thought, loitering at an intersection.\nThe city is still being fed. A place like Kholinar could consume itself\nquickly, once the food or water ran out.\nNo, cities were not civilized places. No more than a whitespine was\ndomesticated just because it had a collar around its neck.\nA small group of cultists dressed as rotspren limped down the street, the\nwet red paint on their clothing evocative of blood. Shallan considered these\npeople extreme and alarming, probably crazy, but Veil wasn’t convinced.\nThey were too theatrical—and there were too many of them—for all to be\ntruly deranged. This was a fad. A way of dealing with unexpected events\nand giving some shape to lives that had been turned upside down.\nThat didn’t mean they weren’t dangerous. A group of people all trying to\nimpress one another was always more dangerous than the lone psychopath.\nSo she gave the cultists a wide berth."

        "text": "That didn’t mean they weren’t dangerous. A group of people all trying to\nimpress one another was always more dangerous than the lone psychopath.\nSo she gave the cultists a wide berth.\nOver the next hour, Veil surveyed the city while wending her way in the\ngeneral direction of the palace. The area with the tailor’s shop was the most\nnormal. It had a good functioning market, which she intended to investigate\nfurther when not pressed for time. It had parks, and though these had been\nappropriated by the crowds, the people in them were lively. Family groups\n—even communities transplanted from outer villages—doing the best they\ncould.\nShe passed bunkerlike mansions of the wealthy. Several had been\nransacked: gates broken down, window shutters cracked, grounds draped\nwith blankets or shanties. Some lighteyed families, it seemed, hadn’t\nmaintained enough guards to withstand the riots.\nAnytime Veil’s path took her closer to the city walls, she entered sections\nof the city that were the most cramped, and the most despondent. Refugees\njust sitting on the streets. Vacant eyes, ragged clothing. People without\nhomes or community.\nThe closer she drew to the palace though, the emptier the city became.\nEven the unfortunates who populated the streets near the walls—where the\nVoidbringers were raiding—knew to stay away from this area.\nThat made the homes of the wealthy here in the palace district seem …\nout of place. In normal times, living close to the palace would have been a\nprivilege, and every large compound here had private walls that sheltered\ndelicate gardens and ostentatious windows. But now, Veil felt the\nwrongness of the area as a prickling sensation on her skin. The families\nliving here must have felt it, but they stubbornly remained in their\nmansions.\nShe peeked through the iron gate of one such mansion, and found\nsoldiers on sentry duty: men in dark uniforms whose colors and heraldry\nshe couldn’t discern. In fact, when one glanced at her, she couldn’t make\nout his eyes. It was probably just a trick of the light, but … storms. The\nsoldiers had a wrongness about them; they moved oddly, rushing in bursts,\nlike prowling predators. They didn’t stop to talk to each other as they\npassed.\nShe backed away and continued down the street. The palace was right\nahead. Straight on in front of it were the wide steps where she’d meet\nKaladin, but she had some time left. She slipped into a park nearby, the first\nshe’d seen in the city that wasn’t clogged with refugees. Towering\nstumpweight trees—bred over time for height and spread of leaves—gave a\nshadowed canopy.\nAway from potential prying eyes, she used Stormlight to overlay Veil’s\nfeatures and clothing with those of Lyn. A stronger, more sturdy build, a\nblue scout’s uniform. The hat became a black rain hat, of the type often\nworn during the Weeping.\nShe left the park as Veil playing a part. She tried to keep this distinction\nsharp in her mind. She was still Veil. Merely in disguise.\nNow, to see what she could find out about the Oathgate.

        "text": "Now, to see what she could find out about the Oathgate. The palace was\nbuilt on a rise overlooking the city, and she slipped through the streets to its\neastern side, where she indeed found the Oathgate platform. It was covered\nin buildings, and was as high as the palace—maybe twenty feet up. It\nconnected to the main palace by a covered walkway that rested atop a small\nwall.\nThey built that walkway right over the ramp, she thought with\ndispleasure. The only other paths up onto the platform were sets of steps cut\ninto the rock, and those were guarded by people in spren costumes.\nVeil watched from a safe distance. So the cult was involved in this\nsomehow? Above on the platform, smoke trailed from a large fire, and Veil\ncould hear sounds rising from that direction. Were those … screams?\nThe whole place was unnerving, and she shivered, then retreated. She\nfound Kaladin leaning against the base of a statue in a square before the\npalace steps. Soulcast out of bronze, the statue depicted a figure in\nShardplate rising as if from waves.\n“Hey,” she said softly. “It’s me. Do you like the boots on this outfit?”\nShe raised her foot.\n“Do we have to keep bringing that up?”\n“I was giving you a passcode, bridgeboy,” she said. “To prove I’m who I\nsay I am.”\n“Lyn’s face made that clear,” he said, handing her the king’s letter, inside\na sealed envelope.\nI like him, Veil thought. An … odd thought, in how much stronger that\nfeeling was to Veil than it had been to Shallan. I like that brooding sense he\nhas about him, those dangerous eyes.\nWhy did Shallan focus so much on Adolin? He was nice, but also bland.\nYou couldn’t tease him without feeling bad, but Kaladin, he glared at you in\nthe most satisfying of ways.\nThe part of her that was still Shallan, deep down, was bothered by this\nline of thinking. So instead, Veil turned her attention to the palace. It was a\ngrand structure, but more like a fortress than she’d pictured. Very Alethi.\nThe bottom floor was a massive rectangle, with the short side facing toward\nthe storm. The upper levels were successively thinner, and a dome rose\nfrom the center of the building.\nFrom up close, she couldn’t make out exactly where the sunlight stopped\nand the shadow began. Indeed, the air of darkness felt … different from\nhow Urithiru had when the dark spren was there. She kept feeling that she\nwasn’t seeing it all. When she’d glance away and look back, she could\nswear that something was different. Had that planter moved, the one\nrunning along the grand entry steps? Or … had that door always been\npainted blue?\nShe took a Memory, then looked away and back, and took another\nMemory. She wasn’t certain what good it would do, as she’d had trouble\ndrawing the palace earlier.\n“Do you see them?” Kaladin whispered. “The soldiers, standing between\nthe pillars?”\nShe hadn’t. The front of the palace—at the top of the long set of stairs—\nwas set with pillars. Looking closer into the shadows, she saw men in there,"

        "text": "the pillars?”\nShe hadn’t. The front of the palace—at the top of the long set of stairs—\nwas set with pillars. Looking closer into the shadows, she saw men in there,\ngathered beneath the overhang supported by the columns. They stood like\nstatues, their spears upright, never moving.\nAnticipationspren rose around Veil, and she jumped. While two of the\nspren looked normal—like flat streamers—the others were wrong. They\nwaved long, thin tendrils that looked like lashes to whip a servant.\nShe shared a glance with Kaladin, then took a Memory of the spren.\n“Shall we?” Kaladin asked.\n“I shall. You stay here.”\nHe glanced at her.\n“If something goes wrong, I’d rather you be ready out here to come in\nand help. Best not to potentially get us both stuck in the grip of one of the\nUnmade. I’ll shout if I need you.”\n“And if you can’t shout? Or if I can’t hear you?”\n“I’ll send Pattern.”\nKaladin folded his arms, but nodded. “Fine. Just be careful.”\n“I’m always careful.”\nHe raised an eyebrow at her, but he was thinking of Shallan. Veil wasn’t\nas foolhardy.\nThe climb up those steps seemed to take far too long. For a moment she\ncould have sworn they stretched into the sky, toward the eternal void. And\nthen she was atop them, standing before those pillars.\nA group of guards approached her.\n“I have a message from the king!” she said, holding it up. “To be\ndelivered directly to Her Majesty. I’ve traveled all the way from the\nShattered Plains!”\nThe guards didn’t break stride. One opened a door into the palace while\nthe others formed up behind Veil, prodding her forward. She swallowed,\nsweat chilling her brow, and let them force her to that door. That maw …\nShe walked into a grand entryway, marked by marble and a brilliant\nsphere chandelier. No Unmade. No darkness waiting to consume her. She\nbreathed out, though she could feel something. That phantom eeriness was\nindeed stronger here. The wrongness. She jumped when one of the soldiers\nput his hand on her shoulder.\nA man in a captainlord’s knots left a small room beside the grand\nchamber. “What is this?”\n“Messenger,” a soldier said. “From the Shattered Plains.” Another\nplucked the letter from her fingers and handed it toward the captainlord. She\ncould see their eyes now, and they seemed ordinary—darkeyed grunts,\nlighteyed officer.\n“Who was your commander there?” the captain asked her, looking over\nthe letter, then squinting at the seal. “Well? I served on the Plains for a few\nyears.”\n“Captain Colot,” she said, naming the officer who had joined the\nWindrunners. He wasn’t Lyn’s actual commander, but he did have scouts in\nhis team.\nThe captainlord nodded, then handed the letter to one of his men. “Take\nit to Queen Aesudan.”\n“I was supposed to deliver it in person,” Veil said, though she itched to\nbe out of this place. To flee madly, if she were being honest. She had to stay.\nWhatever she learned here would be of—"

She had to stay.\nWhatever she learned here would be of—\nOne of the soldiers ran her through.\nIt happened so quickly, she was left gaping at the sword blade protruding\nthrough her chest—wet with her blood. He yanked the weapon back out,\nand Veil collapsed with a groan. She reached for Stormlight, by instinct.\nNo … no, do as … as Jasnah did …\nPretend. Feign. She stared up at the men in horror, in betrayal, painspren\nrising around her. One soldier jogged off with the message, but the captain\nmerely walked back toward his post. Not one of the rest said a word as she\nbled all over the floor, her vision fading …\nShe let her eyes close, then took in a short, sharp breath of Stormlight.\nJust a tiny amount, which she kept within, holding her breath. Enough to\nkeep her alive, heal the wounds inside …\nPattern. Please don’t go. Don’t do anything. Don’t hum, don’t buzz.\nQuiet. Stay quiet.\nOne of the soldiers picked her up and slung her over his shoulder, then\ncarried her through the palace. She dared cracking a single eye, and found\nthe wide hallway here was lined with dozens upon dozens of soldiers.\nJust … standing there. They were alive; they’d cough, or shift position.\nSome leaned back against the wall, but they all kind of stayed in place.\nHuman, but wrong.\nThe guard carrying her passed a floor-to-ceiling mirror rimmed in a\nfancy bronze frame. In it, she glimpsed the guard with Lyn thrown over his\nshoulder. And beyond that, deep within the mirror, something turned—the\nnormal image fading—and looked toward Shallan with a sudden and\nsurprised motion. It looked like a shadow of a person, only with white spots\nfor eyes.\nVeil quickly closed her peeking eye. Storms, what had that been?\nDon’t shift. Stay perfectly still. Don’t even breathe. Stormlight allowed\nher to survive without air.\nThe guard carried her down some steps, then opened a door and walked\ndown a few more. He dropped her none too gently onto the stone and tossed\nher hat on top of her, then turned and left, closing a door behind him.\nVeil waited as long as she could stand before opening her eyes and\nfinding herself in darkness. She took a breath, and nearly choked at the\nrotten, musty stench. Dreading and suspecting what she might find, she\ndrew in Stormlight and made herself glow.\nShe’d been dropped beside a small line of corpses. There were seven of\nthem, three male and four female, wearing fine clothing—but covered in\nrotspren, their flesh chewed at by cremlings.\nHolding in a scream, she scrambled to her feet. Perhaps … perhaps these\nwere some of those lighteyes who’d come to the palace to talk to the queen?\nShe snatched her hat and scrambled to the steps. This was the wine\ncellar, a stone vault cut right into the rock. At the door she finally heard\nPattern, who had been talking, though his voice had seemed distant.\n“Shallan? I felt what you told me. Don’t go. Shallan, are you well? Oh!"

You destroy some things, but seeing others destroyed\nupsets you. Hmmmm.…” He seemed pleased to have figured it out.\nShe focused on his voice, something familiar. Not the memory of a\nsword protruding from her own chest, not the callous way she’d been\ndumped here and left to rot, not the line of corpses with exposed bones,\nhaunted faces, chewed-out eyes …\nDon’t think. Don’t see it.\nShe shoved it all away, and rested her forehead against the door. Then\nshe carefully eased it open and found an empty stone hallway beyond, with\nmore steps leading upward.\nThere were too many soldiers that way. She put on a new illusion, of a\nservant woman from her sketchbook. Maybe that would be less suspicious.\nIt covered the blood, at least.\nShe didn’t head back upstairs, but instead took a separate path farther\ninto the tunnels. This turned out to be the Kholin mausoleum, which was\nlined with another kind of corpse: old kings turned to statues. Their stone\neyes chased her down empty tunnels until she found a door that, judging\nfrom the sunlight underneath, led out into the city.\n“Pattern,” she whispered. “Check for guards outside.”\nHe hummed and slid under the door, then returned a moment later.\n“Mmm … There are two.”\n“Go back, then along the wall slowly to the right,” she said, infusing\nhim.\nHe did so, sliding under the door. A sound she’d created rose from him\nas he moved away, imitating the captainlord’s voice from above, calling for\nthe guards. It wasn’t perfect, as she hadn’t sketched the man, but it seemed\nto work as she heard booted feet move off.\nShe slipped out, and found herself at the base of the rise that the palace\nsat upon, a cliff of some twenty feet above her. The guards were distracted,\nwalking to her right, so Veil slipped onto a street nearby, then ran for a short\ntime, thankful to finally have a chance to work off some of her energy.\nShe collapsed in the shadow of a hollow building, with the windows\nbroken open and the door missing. Pattern scooted along the ground nearby,\njoining her. The guards didn’t seem to have noticed her.\n“Go find Kaladin,” she said to Pattern. “Bring him here. Warn him that\nsoldiers might be watching him from the palace, and they might come for\nhim.”\n“Mmmm.” Pattern slid away from her. She huddled against herself, back\nto a stone wall, her coat still covered in blood. After a nerve-racking wait,\nKaladin stepped onto the street, then hurried up to her. “Storms!” he said,\nkneeling beside her. Pattern slipped off his coat, humming happily.\n“Shallan, what happened to you?”\n“Well,” she said, “as a connoisseur of things that have killed me, I think\na sword happened.”\n“Shallan…”\n“The evil force that rules the palace did not think highly of someone\ncoming with a letter from the king.” She smiled at him. “You could say, um,\nit made that point quite clear.”"

I plead with any who hear this to recognize you\nare not so different as you think.\n—From drawer 27-19, topaz\nDalinar reached into the dark stone shaft where he’d hidden the assassin’s\nHonorblade. It was still there; he felt the hilt under the lip of stone.\nHe expected to feel more upon touching it. Power? A tingling? This was\na weapon of Heralds, a thing so ancient that common Shardblades were\nyoung by comparison. Yet, as he slipped it free and stood up, the only thing\nhe felt was his own anger. This was the weapon of the assassin who had\nkilled his brother. The weapon used to terrorize Roshar, murder the lords of\nJah Keved and Azir.\nIt was shortsighted of him to see such an ancient weapon merely as the\nsword of the Assassin in White. He stepped out into the larger room next\ndoor, then regarded the sword in the light of the spheres he had placed on a\nstone slab there. Sinuous and elegant, this was the weapon of a king.\nJezerezeh’Elin.\n“There are some who assumed you were one of the Heralds,” Dalinar\nnoted to the Stormfather, who rumbled in the back of his mind. “Jezerezeh,\nHerald of Kings, Father of Storms.”\nMen say many foolish things, the Stormfather replied. Some name Kelek\nStormfather, others Jezrien. I am neither of them.\n“But Jezerezeh was a Windrunner.”\nHe was before Windrunners. He was Jezrien, a man whose powers bore\nno name. They were simply him. The Windrunners were named only after\nIshar founded the orders.\n“Ishi’Elin,” Dalinar said. “Herald of Luck.”\nOr of mysteries, the Stormfather said, or of priests. Or of a dozen other\nthings, as men dubbed him. He is now as mad as the rest. More, perhaps.\nDalinar lowered the Honorblade, looking eastward toward the Origin.\nEven through the stone walls, he knew that was where to find the\nStormfather. “Do you know where they are?”\nI have told you. I do not see all. Only glimpses in the storms.\n“Do you know where they are?”"

Uh, that was a curse.… Never mind. Tezim, the god-priest of\nTukar? Is it him? Ishi, Herald of Luck, is the man who has been waging war\nagainst Emul?”\nYes.\n“For what purpose?”\nHe is insane. Do not look for meaning in his actions.\n“When … when were you thinking of informing me of this?”\nWhen you asked. When else would I speak of it?\n“When you thought of it!” Dalinar said. “You know things that are\nimportant, Stormfather!”\nHe just rumbled his reply.\nDalinar took a deep breath, trying to calm himself. Spren did not think\nlike men. Anger would not change what the Stormfather told him. But what\nwould?\n“Did you know about my powers?” Dalinar asked. “Did you know that I\ncould heal the stone?”\nI knew it once you did it, the Stormfather said. Yes, once you did it, I\nalways knew.\n“Do you know what else I can do?”\nOf course. Once you discover it, I will know.\n“But—”\nYour powers will come when you are ready for them, not before, the\nStormfather said. They cannot be hurried or forced.\nBut do not look toward the powers of others, even those who share your\nSurges. Their lot is not yours, and their powers are small, petty things.\nWhat you did in reknitting those statues was a mere trifle, a party trick.\nYours is the power Ishar once held. Before he was Herald of Luck, they\ncalled him Binder of Gods. He was the founder of the Oathpact. No Radiant\nis capable of more than you. Yours is the power of Connection, of joining\nmen and worlds, minds and souls. Your Surges are the greatest of all,\nthough they will be impotent if you seek to wield them for mere battle.\nThe words washed over Dalinar, seeming to press him backward with\ntheir force. When the Stormfather was done, Dalinar found himself out of\nbreath, a headache coming on. He reflexively drew in Stormlight to heal it,\nand the small chamber dimmed. That stopped the pain, but it did nothing for\nhis cold sweat.\n“Are there others like me out there?” he finally asked.\nNot right now, and there can ever be only three. One for each of us.\n“Three?” Dalinar said. “Three spren who make Bondsmiths. You … and\nCultivation are two?”\nThe Stormfather actually laughed. You would have a difficult time\nmaking her your spren. I should like to see you try it.\n“Then who?”\nMy siblings need not concern you.\nThey seemed of compelling concern, but Dalinar had learned when to\navoid pressing an issue.

He’d seen\nthese loose, and had always been surprised by how small they actually\nwere. The glass made them look far larger.\nHonor’s power, during a storm, is concentrated in one place, the\nStormfather said. It pierces all three realms and brings Physical, Cognitive,\nand Spiritual together momentarily in one. The gemstones, exposed to the\nwonder of the Spiritual Realm, are lit by the infinite power there.\n“Could you renew this sphere, now?”\nI … do not know. He sounded intrigued. Hold it forth.\nDalinar did so, and felt something happen, a tugging on his insides, like\nthe Stormfather straining against their bond. The sphere remained dun.\nIt is not possible, the Stormfather said. I am close to you, but the power\nis not—it still rides the storm.\nThat was far more than he usually got from the Stormfather. He hoped he\ncould remember it exactly to repeat to Navani—of course, if the\nStormfather was listening, he’d correct Dalinar’s mistakes. The Stormfather\nhated to be misquoted.\nDalinar stepped out into the hallway to meet Bridge Four. He held up the\nHonorblade—a powerful, world-changing artifact. But, like the Shardblades\nmodeled after it, the weapon was useless if he left it hidden.\n“This,” he said to the men of Bridge Four, “is the Honorblade your\ncaptain recovered.”\nThe twenty-odd men gathered closer, their curious faces reflecting in the\nmetal.\n“Anyone who holds this,” Dalinar said, “will immediately gain the\npowers of a Windrunner. Your captain’s absence is interrupting your\ntraining. Perhaps this, though only one can use it at a time, can mitigate\nthat.”\nThey gaped at the weapon, so Dalinar held it out toward Kaladin’s first\nlieutenant—the bearded older bridgeman named Teft.\nTeft reached out, then drew his hand back. “Leyten,” he barked. “You’re\nour storming armorer. You take the thing.”\n“Me?” a stocky bridgeman said. “That’s not armor.”\n“Close enough.”\n“I…”\n“Airsick lowlanders,” Rock the Horneater said, shoving forward and\ntaking the weapon. “Your soup is cold. That is idiom for ‘You are all\nstupid.’ ” The Horneater hefted it, curious, and his eyes bled to a glassy\nblue.\n“Rock?” Teft asked. “You? Holding a weapon?”\n“I am not going to swing this thing,” Rock said, rolling his eyes. “I will\nkeep him safe. This is all.”\n“It’s a Shardblade,” Dalinar warned. “You’ve trained on those, correct?”\n“We have, sir,” Teft said. “Doesn’t mean one of this lot won’t storming\ncut their own feet off.

If so, that might be a valuable extra use of the weapon.\n“Don’t let anyone know you have this,” Dalinar told them. “I assume\nyou can learn to dismiss and summon it like an ordinary Shardblade. See\nwhat you can discover, then report to me.”\n“We’ll put it to good use, sir,” Teft promised.\n“Good.” The clock fabrial on his forearm dinged, and Dalinar stifled a\nsigh. She’d learned to make it ding? “If you’ll all excuse me, I have to\nprepare for an appointment with an emperor a thousand miles away.”\n* * *\nA short time later, Dalinar stood on his balcony. Hands clasped behind his\nback, he stared out toward the Oathgate transport platforms.\n“I did a great deal of business with the Azish when I was younger,” Fen\nsaid from behind him. “This might not work, but it is a much better plan\nthan traditional Alethi strutting.”\n“I don’t like him going alone,” Navani replied.\n“By all reports,” Fen said dryly, “he got stabbed through the chest, lifted\na stone roughly the weight of ten men, then started putting my city back\ntogether one rock at a time. I think he’ll be fine.”\n“No amount of Stormlight will help if they simply imprison him,”\nNavani said. “We could be sending him to become a hostage.”\nThey were arguing for his benefit. He had to understand the risks. And he\ndid. He walked over to give Navani a light kiss. He smiled at her, then\nturned and extended his hand toward Fen, who gave him a paper packet,\nlike a large envelope.\n“This is it, then?” he asked. “All three are in here?”\n“They’re marked with appropriate glyphs,” Navani said. “And the\nspanreed is inside too. They’ve promised to speak in Alethi during the\nmeeting—you won’t have an interpreter from our side, as you insist on\ngoing alone.”\n“I do,” Dalinar said, starting toward the door. “I want to try Fen’s\nsuggestion.”\nNavani quickly rose and took his arm with her freehand.\n“I assure you,” he said. “I will be safe.”\n“No you won’t. But this is no different from a hundred other times\nyou’ve ridden off to battle. Here.” She handed him a small box sheathed in\ncloth.\n“Fabrial?”\n“Lunch,” she said. “There’s no telling when those people will feed you.”\nShe’d wrapped it in a glyphward. Dalinar cocked his eyebrow at it, and\nshe shrugged. Can’t hurt, right? that seemed to say. She took him in an\nembrace, held on an extra moment—more than another Alethi might—then\nstepped back. “We’ll be watching the spanreed.

He couldn’t write to them of course, but he could flip the\nreed on and off to send signals, an old general’s trick for when you lacked a\nscribe.\nA short time later, he strode out onto Urithiru’s western plateau. Crossing\nit on his way to the Oathgate, he passed men marching in formations,\nsergeants shouting orders, runners carrying messages. Two of his\nShardbearers—Rust and Serugiadis, men who had the Plate only—practiced\nwith massive Shardbows, launching thick arrows hundreds of yards toward\na large straw target that Kaladin had placed for them on a nearby\nmountainside.\nA significant number of the common soldiers sat around holding spheres,\nstaring at them intently. Word had spread that Bridge Four was recruiting.\nHe’d lately noticed numerous men in the hallways holding a sphere “for\nluck.” Dalinar even passed a group out here who were talking about\nswallowing spheres.\nThe Stormfather rumbled with displeasure. They go about this backward.\nFoolish men. They can’t draw in Light and become Radiant; they first must\nbe approaching Radiance, and look for Light to fulfill the promise.\nDalinar barked at the men to get back to training, and to not swallow any\nspheres. They obeyed with a scrambling rush, shocked to find the\nBlackthorn looming over them. He shook his head, then continued. His\npath, unfortunately, took him through a mock battle. Two blocks of\nspearmen pressed against each other on the plateau, straining and grunting,\ntraining to hold their formations under stress. Though they carried blunt\npractice spears, this was mostly shield work.\nDalinar saw the warning signs of things going too far. Men were\nshouting with real acrimony, and angerspren were boiling at their feet. One\nof the lines wavered, and instead of pulling back, their opponents rammed\ntheir shields against them repeatedly.\nGreen and white on one side, black and maroon on the other. Sadeas and\nAladar. Dalinar cursed and approached the men, shouting for them to pull\nback. Soon, his call was taken up by captains and commanders. The rear\nranks of the two practice blocks pulled away—leaving the contestants at the\ncenter to devolve into a brawl.\nDalinar shouted, and Stormlight shimmered along the stones before him.\nThose who hadn’t gotten caught up in the fighting jumped back. The rest\ngot stuck in the Stormlight, which glued them to the ground. This caused all\nbut the most furious to stop their fighting.\nHe pulled the last few apart and pushed them down, sticking them by\ntheir seats to the stone next to their angerspren. The men thrashed, then saw\nhim and froze, looking appropriately chagrined.\nI remember being that wrapped up in battle, Dalinar thought. Is it the\nThrill?

The soldiers from Sadeas’s army, however,\nspat at the ground and heaved themselves to their feet, retreating in sullen\nbunches, cursing and muttering.\nThey’re getting worse, Dalinar thought. Under Torol Sadeas, they’d been\nslovenly and sadistic, but still soldiers. Yes, they tended to brawl, but they’d\nbeen quick to obey in battle. So they’d been effective, just not exemplary.\nThe new Sadeas banner flew above these men. Meridas Sadeas—\nAmaram—had changed the glyphpair’s design, as was traditional: Sadeas’s\nsquat tower had elongated, and the hammer had changed to an axe.\nDespite his reputation for running a crisp army, it was obvious he was\nhaving trouble controlling these men. He’d never commanded a force this\nlarge—and perhaps the murder of their highprince had upset the men to the\npoint that there was nothing Amaram could do.\nAladar hadn’t been able to provide anything of substance about Torol’s\nmurder. The investigation was supposed to be ongoing … but there were no\nleads. The spren hadn’t done it, but they had no idea who had.\nI’ll need to take action about those soldiers, Dalinar thought. They need\nsomething to tire them out, keep them from getting into fights.…\nPerhaps he had just the thing. He considered that as he finally made his\nway up the ramp to the proper Oathgate platform, then crossed the empty\nfield to the control building. Jasnah waited within, reading a book and\nmaking notes. “What took you?” she asked.\n“Almost had a riot out on the parade ground,” he said. “Two training\nformations got interlocked and started bashing one another.”\n“Sadeas?”\nDalinar nodded.\n“We’ll have to do something about them.”\n“I’ve been thinking. Maybe some hard labor—strictly supervised—in a\nruined city might be just the thing.”\nJasnah smiled. “How convenient that we’re currently providing exactly\nsuch assistance to Queen Fen. Work Sadeas’s troops to exhaustion,\nassuming we can keep them under control there.”\n“I’ll start with small batches, to be certain we’re not sending more\ntrouble Fen’s direction,” Dalinar said. “Have you had any news from the\nking’s infiltration team at Kholinar?” As anticipated, the Stormfather was\nunable to reach anyone on the team to bring them into a vision—nor would\nDalinar dare risk it—but they’d sent several spanreeds with Elhokar and\nShallan.\n“None. We’ll keep watch and tell you the moment we get any sort of\nresponse.”\nDalinar nodded, and shoved down his worry for Elhokar and his son. He\nhad to trust that they’d eventually either accomplish their task, or find a way\nto report what was stopping them.\nJasnah summoned her Shardblade.

Odd how natural it looked to see\nJasnah with a sword. “You ready?”\n“I am.”\nThe Reshi girl, Lift, had obtained permission from the Azish court to\nunlock the Oathgate on their side. The emperor was—at long last—willing\nto meet with Dalinar in the flesh.\nJasnah engaged the device, rotating the inner wall, the floor shimmering.\nLight flashed outside, and immediately, stuffy heat surged in through the\ndoorways. Apparently a season of summer was well under way in Azir.\nIt smelled different here. Of exotic spices and more subtle things like\nunfamiliar woods.\n“Good luck,” Jasnah said as he stepped out of the room. It flashed behind\nhim as she returned to Urithiru, leaving him to meet the Azish imperial\ncourt on his own.\n65. Verdict\nNow that we abandon the tower, can I finally admit that I hate this\nplace? Too many rules.\n—From drawer 8-1, amethyst\nMemories churned in Dalinar’s head as he walked down a long corridor\noutside the Oathgate control building in Azimir, which was covered by a\nmagnificent bronze dome. The Grand Market, as it was called, was an\nenormous indoor shopping district. That would prove inconvenient when\nDalinar needed to use the full Oathgate.\nHe couldn’t see any of the market currently; the control building—which\nhad been treated as some kind of monument in the market—was now\nsurrounded by a wooden set of walls, and a new corridor. Empty of people,\nit was lit by sphere lamps along the walls. Sapphires. Coincidence, or a\ngesture of respect to a Kholin visitor?\nAt the end, the hallway opened into a small room populated by a line of\nAzish soldiers. They wore plated mail, with colorful caps on their heads,\ngreatshields, and very long-handled axes with small heads. The whole\ngroup jumped as Dalinar entered, and then shied back, weapons held\nthreateningly.\nDalinar held his arms out to the sides, packet from Fen in one hand, food\nbundle in the other. “I am unarmed.”\nThey spoke quickly in Azish. He didn’t see the Prime or the little\nRadiant, though the people in patterned robes were viziers and scions—both\nwere, essentially, Azish versions of ardents. Except here, the ardents were\ninvolved in the government far more than was proper.\nA woman stepped forward, the many layers of her long, extravagant\nrobes rustling as she walked. A matching hat completed the outfit. She was\nimportant, and perhaps planned to interpret for him herself.\nTime for my first attack, Dalinar thought. He opened the packet that Fen\nhad given him and removed four pieces of paper.\nHe presented them to the woman, and was pleased at the shock in her\neyes. She hesitantly took them, then called to some of her companions.\nThey joined her before Dalinar, which made the guards distinctly anxious.\nA few had drawn triangular kattari, a popular variety of short sword here in\nthe west.

The plan\nwas to exchange pleasantries in this room, then for Dalinar to immediately\nreturn to Urithiru—whereupon they intended to lock the Oathgate from\ntheir side. He wanted more. He intended to get more. Some kind of alliance,\nor at least a meeting with the emperor.\nOne of the ardents started reading the papers to the others. The writing\nwas in Azish, a funny language made of little markings that looked like\ncremling tracks. It lacked the elegant, sweeping verticals of the Alethi\nwomen’s script.\nDalinar closed his eyes, listening to the unfamiliar language. As in\nThaylen City, he had a moment of feeling he could almost understand.\nStretching, he felt that meaning was close to him.\n“Would you help me understand?” he whispered to the Stormfather.\nWhat makes you think I can?\n“Don’t be coy,” Dalinar whispered. “I’ve spoken new languages in the\nvisions. You can make me speak Azish.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled in discontent. That wasn’t me, he finally said. It\nwas you.\n“How do I use it?”\nTry touching one of them. With Spiritual Adhesion, you can make a\nConnection.\nDalinar regarded the group of hostile guards, then sighed, waving and\nmiming the act of dumping a drink into his mouth. The soldiers exchanged\nsharp words, then one of the youngest was pushed forward with a canteen.\nDalinar nodded in thanks, then—as he took a drink from the water bottle—\ngrabbed the young man by the wrist and held on.\nStormlight, the rumbling in his mind said.\nDalinar pressed Stormlight into the other man, and felt something—like\na friendly sound coming from another room. All you had to do was get in.\nAfter a careful shove, the door opened, and sounds twisted and undulated in\nthe air. Then, like music changing keys, they modulated from gibberish to\nsense.\n“Captain!” cried the young guard that Dalinar held. “What do I do? He’s\ngot me!”\nDalinar let go, and fortunately his understanding of the language\npersisted. “I’m sorry, soldier,” Dalinar said, handing back the canteen. “I\ndidn’t mean to alarm you.”\nThe young soldier stepped back among his fellows. “The warlord speaks\nAzish?” He sounded as surprised as if he’d met a talking chull.\nDalinar clasped his hands behind his back and watched the ardents. You\ninsist on thinking of them as ardents, he told himself, because they can\nread, both male and female. But he was no longer in Alethkar. Despite those\nbulky robes and large hats, the Azish women wore nothing on their\nsafehands.\nSunmaker, Dalinar’s ancestor, had argued that the Azish had been in\nneed of civilizing. He wondered if anyone had believed that argument even\nin those days, or if they’d all seen it for the rationalization it was.\nThe viziers and scions finished reading, then turned toward Dalinar,\nlowering the pages he’d given them.

Instead,\nhe had brought a different kind of weapon.\nAn essay.\n“Do you truly speak our language, Alethi?” the lead vizier called. She\nhad a round face, dark brown eyes, and a cap covered in bright patterns. Her\ngreying hair came out the side in a tight braid.\n“I’ve had the opportunity to learn it recently,” Dalinar said. “You are\nVizier Noura, I assume?”\n“Did Queen Fen really write this?”\n“With her own hand, Your Grace,” Dalinar said. “Feel free to contact\nThaylen City to confirm.”\nThey huddled to consult again in quiet tones. The essay was a lengthy\nbut compelling argument for the economic value of the Oathgates to the\ncities that hosted them. Fen argued that Dalinar’s desperation to forge an\nalliance made for the perfect opportunity to secure beneficial and lasting\ntrade deals through Urithiru. Even if Azir had no plans to fully join the\ncoalition, they should negotiate use of the Oathgates and send a delegation\nto the tower.\nIt spent a lot of words saying what was obvious, and was exactly the sort\nof thing Dalinar had no patience for. Which, hopefully, would make it\nperfect for the Azish. And if it wasn’t quite sufficient … well, Dalinar knew\nnever to go into battle without fresh troops in reserve.\n“Your Highness,” Noura said, “as impressed as we are that you cared to\nlearn our language—and even considering the compelling argument\npresented here—we think it best if…”\nShe trailed off as Dalinar reached in his packet and withdrew a second\nsheaf of papers, six pages this time. He held them up before the group like a\nraised banner, then proffered them. A nearby guard jumped back, making\nhis mail jingle.\nThe small chamber grew quiet. Finally, a guard accepted the papers and\ntook them to the viziers and scions. A shorter man among them began\nreading quietly—this one was an extended treatise from Navani, talking\nabout the wonders they’d discovered in Urithiru, formally inviting the Azish\nscholars to visit and share.\nShe made clever arguments about the importance of new fabrials and\ntechnology in fighting the Voidbringers. She included diagrams of the tents\nshe’d made to help them fight during the Weeping, and explained her\ntheories for floating towers. Then, with Dalinar’s permission, she offered a\ngift: detailed schematics that Taravangian had brought from Jah Keved,\nexplaining the creation of so-called half-shards, fabrial shields that could\nwithstand a few blows from Shardblades.\nThe enemy is united against us, went her essay’s final argument. They\nhave the unique advantages of focus, harmony, and memories that extend\nfar into the past. Resisting them will require our greatest minds, whether\nAlethi, Azish, Veden, or Thaylen. I freely give state secrets, for the days of\nhoarding knowledge are gone. Now, we either learn together or we fall\nindividually.\nThe viziers finished, then they passed around the schematics, studying\nthem for an extended time. When the group looked back at Dalinar, he"

When the group looked back at Dalinar, he\ncould see that their attitude was changing. Remarkably, this was working.\nWell, he didn’t know much about essays, but he had an instinct for\ncombat. When your opponent was gasping for breath, you didn’t let him get\nback up. You rammed your sword right into his throat.\nDalinar reached into his packet and removed the last paper inside: a\nsingle sheet written on front and back. He held it up between his first two\nfingers. The Azish watched it with wide eyes, as if he’d revealed a glowing\ngemstone of incalculable wealth.\nThis time Vizier Noura herself stepped forward and took it. “ ‘Verdict,’ ”\nshe read from the top. “ ‘By Jasnah Kholin.’ ”\nThe others pushed through the guards, gathering around, and began\nreading it to themselves. Though this was the shortest of the essays, he\nheard them whispering and marveling over it.\n“Look, it incorporates all seven of Aqqu’s Logical Forms!”\n“That’s an allusion to the Grand Orientation. And … storms … she\nquotes Prime Kasimarlix in three successive stages, each escalating the\nsame quote to a different level of Superior Understanding.”\nOne woman held her hand to her mouth. “It’s written entirely in a single\nrhythmic meter!”\n“Great Yaezir,” Noura said. “You’re right.”\n“The allusions…”\n“Such wordplay…”\n“The momentum and rhetoric…”\nLogicspren burst around them in the shape of little stormclouds. Then,\npractically as one, the scions and viziers turned to Dalinar.\n“This is a work of art,” Noura said.\n“Is it … persuasive?” Dalinar asked.\n“It provokes further consideration,” Noura said, looking to the others,\nwho nodded. “You actually came alone. We are shocked by that—aren’t you\nworried for your safety?”\n“Your Radiant,” Dalinar said, “has proven to be wise for one so young. I\nam certain I can depend on her for my safety.”\n“I don’t know that I’d depend on her for anything,” said one of the men,\nchuckling. “Unless it’s swiping your pocket change.”\n“All the same,” Dalinar said, “I have come begging you to trust me. This\nseemed the best proof of my intentions.” He spread his hands to the sides.\n“Do not send me back immediately. Let us talk as allies, not men in a\nbattlefield tent of parley.”\n“I will bring these essays before the Prime and his formal council,”\nVizier Noura finally said. “I admit he seems fond of you, despite your\ninexplicable invasion of his dreams. Come with us.”\nThat would lead him away from the Oathgate, and any chance he had at\ntransferring home in an emergency. But that was what he’d been hoping for.\n“Gladly, Your Grace.”\n* * *\nThey walked along a twisting path through the dome-covered market—\nwhich was now empty, like a ghost town.

Many of the streets ended at\nbarricades manned by troops.\nThey’d turned the Azimir Grand Market into a kind of reverse fortress,\nintended to protect the city from whatever might come through the\nOathgate. If troops left the control building, they would find themselves in a\nmaze of confusing streets.\nUnfortunately for the Azish, the control building alone was not the gate.\nA Radiant could make this entire dome vanish, replaced with an army in the\nmiddle of Azimir. He’d have to be delicate about how he explained that.\nHe walked with Vizier Noura, followed by the other scribes, who passed\nthe essays around again. Noura didn’t make small talk with him, and\nDalinar maintained no illusions. This trip through the dark indoor streets—\nwith packed market buildings and twisting paths—was meant to confuse\nhim, should he try to remember the way.\nThey eventually climbed up to a second level and left through a doorway\nout onto a ledge along the outside rim of the dome. Clever. From up here,\nhe could see that the ground-floor exits from the market were barricaded or\nsealed off. The only clear way out was up that flight of steps, onto this\nplatform around the circumference of the large bronze dome, then down\nanother set of steps.\nFrom this upper ramp, he could see some of Azimir—and was relieved\nby how little destruction he saw. Some of the neighborhoods on the west\nside of the city seemed to have collapsed, but all in all, the city had\nweathered the Everstorm in good shape. Most of the structures were stone\nhere, and the grand domes—many overlaid with reddish-gold bronze—\nreflected the sunlight like molten marvels. The people wore colorful\nclothing, of patterns that scribes could read like a language.\nThis summer season was warmer than he was accustomed to. Dalinar\nturned east. Urithiru lay somewhere in that direction, in the border\nmountains—far closer to Azir than to Alethkar.\n“This way, Blackthorn,” Noura said, starting down the wooden ramp. It\nwas constructed upon a woodwork lattice. Seeing those wooden stilts,\nDalinar had a moment of surreal memory. It vaguely reminded him of\nsomething, of perching above a city and looking down at wooden lattices.…\nRathalas, he thought. The Rift. The city that had rebelled. Right. He felt\na chill, and the pressure of something hidden trying to thrust itself into his\nconsciousness. There was more to remember about that place.\nHe walked down the ramp, and took it as a mark of respect that two\nentire divisions of troops surrounded the dome. “Shouldn’t those men be on\nthe walls?” Dalinar asked. “What if the Voidbringers attack?”\n“They’ve withdrawn through Emul,” Noura said. “Most of that country\nis on fire by now, due to either the parshmen or Tezim’s armies.”\nTezim. Who was a Herald. Surely he wouldn’t side with the enemy, would\nhe?

It was\nnovel, being pulled by a man acting like a chull. Though it was faster than a\npalanquin, Dalinar found it far less stately.\nThe city was laid out in a very orderly manner. Navani had always\nadmired that. He watched for more signs of destruction, and while he found\nfew, a different oddity struck him. Masses of people standing in clumps,\nwearing colorful vests, loose trousers or skirts, and patterned caps. They\nshouted about unfairness, and though they looked angry, they were\nsurrounded by logicspren.\n“What’s all this?” Dalinar asked.\n“Protestors.” She looked to him, and obviously noted his confusion.\n“They’ve lodged a formal complaint, rejecting an order to exit the city and\nwork the farms. This gives them a one-month period to make their\ngrievances known before being forced to comply.”\n“They can simply disobey an imperial order?”\n“I suppose you’d merely march everyone out at swordpoint. Well, we\ndon’t do things that way here. There are processes. Our people aren’t\nslaves.”\nDalinar found himself bristling; she obviously didn’t know much about\nAlethkar, if she assumed all Alethi darkeyes were like chulls to be herded\naround. The lower classes had a long and proud tradition of rights related to\ntheir social ranking.\n“Those people,” he said, realizing something, “have been ordered to the\nfields because you lost your parshmen.”\n“Our fields haven’t yet been planted,” Noura said, eyes growing distant.\n“It’s like they knew the very best time to cripple us by leaving. Carpenters\nand cobblers must be pressed into manual labor, just to prevent a famine.\nWe might feed ourselves, but our trades and infrastructure will be\ndevastated.”\nIn Alethkar, they hadn’t been as fixated on this, as reclaiming the\nkingdom was more pressing. In Thaylenah, the disaster had been physical,\nthe city ravaged. Both kingdoms had been distracted from a more\nsubversive disaster, the economic one.\n“How did it happen?” Dalinar asked. “The parshmen leaving?”\n“They gathered in the storm,” she said. “Leaving homes and walking\nright out into it. Some reports said the parshmen claimed to hear the beating\nof drums. Other reports—these are all very contradictory—speak of spren\nguiding the parshmen.\n“They swarmed the city gates, threw them open in the rain, then moved\nout onto the plain surrounding the city. The next day, they demanded formal\neconomic redress for improper appropriation of their labors. They claimed\nthe subsection of the rules exempting parshmen from wages was extralegal,\nand put a motion through the courts. We were negotiating—a bizarre\nexperience, I must say—before some of their leaders got them marching off\ninstead.”\nInteresting. Alethi parshmen had acted Alethi—immediately gathering\nfor war.

Alethi\nliked to joke about them—insult one of their soldiers, it was said, and he’d\nsubmit a form requesting an opportunity to swear at you. But that was a\ncaricature, likely about as accurate as Noura’s own impression of his people\nalways doing everything by the sword and spear.\nOnce at the palace, Dalinar tried to follow Noura and the other scribes\ninto the main building—but soldiers instead gestured him toward a small\noutbuilding.\n“I was hoping,” he called after Noura, “to speak with the emperor in\nperson.”\n“Unfortunately, this petition cannot be granted,” she said. The group left\nhim and strode into the grand palace itself, a majestic bronze building with\nbulbous domes.\nThe soldiers sequestered him in a narrow chamber with a low table at the\ncenter and nice couches along the sides.

It wasn’t quite a prison, but he\nobviously wasn’t to be allowed to roam either.\nHe sighed and sat on a couch, dropping his lunch to the table beside\nsome bowls of dried fruit and nuts.

How did men suffer this? In battle, you won\nor lost based on strength of arms. At the end of the day, you knew where\nyou stood.\nThis endless talking left him so uncertain. Would the viziers dismiss the\nessays? Jasnah’s reputation seemed to be powerful even here, but they’d\nseemed less impressed by her argument than by the way she expressed it.\nYou’ve always worried about this, haven’t you? the Stormfather said in\nhis mind.\n“About what?”\nThat the world would come to be ruled by pens and scribes, not swords\nand generals.\n“I…” Blood of my fathers. That was true.\nWas that why he insisted on negotiating himself? Why he didn’t send\nambassadors? Was it because deep down, he didn’t trust their gilded words\nand intricate promises, all contained in documents he couldn’t read? Pieces\nof paper that were somehow harder than the strongest Shardplate?\n“The contests of kingdoms are supposed to be a masculine art,” he said.\n“I should be able to do this myself.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled, not truly in disagreement. Just in …\namusement?\nDalinar finally settled onto one of the couches. Might as well eat\nsomething … except his cloth-wrapped lunch lay open, crumbs on the table,\nthe wooden curry box empty save for a few drips. What on Roshar?\nHe slowly looked up at the other couch. The slender Reshi girl perched\nnot on the seat, but up on the backrest. She wore an oversized Azish robe\nand cap, and was gnawing on the sausage Navani had packed with the meal,\nto be cut into the curry."

Were you in here all\nalong?”\nShe shrugged, continuing to eat his food. “You said something earlier.\nAbout men?”\n“I … was beginning to realize that I’m uncomfortable with the idea of\nscribes controlling the fates of nations. The things women write are stronger\nthan my military.”\n“Yeah, that makes sense. Lots of boys is afraid of girls.”\n“I’m not—”\n“They say it changes when you grow up,” she said, leaning forward. “I\nwouldn’t know, because I ain’t going to grow. I figured it out. I just gotta\nstop eatin’. People that don’t eat, don’t get bigger. Easy.”\nShe said it all around mouthfuls of his food.\n“Easy,” Dalinar said. “I’m sure.”\n“I’m gonna start any day now,” she said. “You want that fruit, or…”\nHe leaned forward, pushing the two bowls of dried fruit toward her. She\nattacked them. Dalinar leaned back in the seat. This girl seemed so out of\nplace. Though she was lighteyed—with pale, clear irises—that didn’t matter\nas much in the west. The regal clothing was too big on her, and she didn’t\ntake care to keep her hair pulled back and tucked up under the cap.\nThis entire room—this entire city, really—was an exercise in ostentation.\nMetal leaf coated domes, the rickshaws, even large portions of the walls of\nthis room. The Azish owned only a few Soulcasters, and famously one\ncould make bronze.\nThe carpeting and couches displayed bright patterns of orange and red.\nThe Alethi favored solid colors, perhaps some embroidery. The Azish\npreferred their decorations to look like the product of a painter having a\nsneezing fit.\nIn the middle of it all was this girl, who looked so simple. She swam\nthrough ostentation, but it didn’t stick to her.\n“I listened to what they’re sayin’ in there, tight-butt,” the girl said.\n“Before comin’ here. I think they’re gonna deny you. They gots a finger.”\n“I should think they have many fingers.”\n“Nah, this is an extra one. Dried out, looks like it belonged to some\ngramma’s gramma, but it’s actually from an emperor. Emperor Snot-a-Lot\nor—”\n“Snoxil?” Dalinar asked.\n“Yeah. That’s him.”\n“He was Prime when my ancestor sacked Azimir,” Dalinar said with a\nsigh. “It’s a relic.” The Azish could be a superstitious lot, for all their claims\nabout logic and essays and codes of law. This relic was probably being used\nduring their discussions as a reminder of the last time the Alethi had been in\nAzir.\n“Yeah, well, all I know is he’s dead, so he ain’t got to worry about …\nabout…”\n“Odium.”"

They listened to you\nwhen you asked to unlock the Oathgate.”\n“Nah, they listened to Gawx,” she said. “The geezers that run the city\ndon’t like me much.”\nDalinar grunted. “Your name is Lift, right?”\n“Right.”\n“And your order?”\n“More food.”\n“I meant your order of Knights Radiant. What powers do you have?”\n“Oh. Um … Edgedancer? I slip around and stuff.”\n“Slip around.”\n“It’s real fun. Except when I run into things. Then it’s only kinda fun.”\nDalinar leaned forward, wishing—again—he could go in and talk to all\nthose fools and scribes.\nNo. For once, trust in someone else, Dalinar.\nLift cocked her head. “Huh. You smell like her.”\n“Her?”\n“The crazy spren who lives in the forest.”\n“You’ve met the Nightwatcher?”\n“Yeah … You?”\nHe nodded.\nThey sat there, uncomfortable, until the young girl handed one of her\nbowls of dried fruit toward Dalinar. He took a piece and chewed it in\nsilence, and she took another.\nThey ate the entire bowl, saying nothing until the door opened. Dalinar\njumped. Noura stood in the doorway, flanked by other viziers. Her eyes\nflickered toward Lift, and she smiled. Noura didn’t seem to think as poorly\nof Lift as the little girl indicated.\nDalinar stood up, feeling a sense of dread. He prepared his arguments,\nhis pleas. They had to—\n“The emperor and his council,” Noura said, “have decided to accept your\ninvitation to visit Urithiru.”\nDalinar cut off his objection. Did she say accept?\n“The Prime of Emul has almost reached Azir,” Noura said. “He brought\nthe Sage with him, and they should be willing to join us. Unfortunately,\nfollowing the parshman assault, Emul is a fraction of what it once was. I\nsuspect he will be eager for any and every source of aid, and will welcome\nthis coalition of yours.\n“The prince of Tashikk has an ambassador—his brother—in the city.\nHe’ll come as well, and the princess of Yezier is reportedly coming in\nperson to plead for aid. We’ll see about her. I think she simply believes\nAzimir will be safer. She lives here half the year anyway.\n“Alm and Desh have ambassadors in the city, and Liafor is always eager\nto join whatever we do, as long as they can cater the storming meetings. I\ncan’t speak for Steen—they’re a tricky bunch. I doubt you want Tukar’s\npriest-king, and Marat is overrun. But we can bring a good sampling of the\nempire to join your discussions.”\n“I…” Dalinar stammered. “Thank you!” It was actually happening! As\nthey’d hoped, Azir was the linchpin."

As\nthey’d hoped, Azir was the linchpin.\n“Well, your wife writes a good essay,” Noura said.\nHe started. “Navani’s essay was the one that convinced you? Not\nJasnah’s?”\n“Each of the three arguments were weighed favorably, and the reports\nfrom Thaylen City are encouraging,” Noura said. “That had no small part in\nour decision. But while Jasnah Kholin’s writing is every bit as impressive as\nher reputation suggests, there was something … more authentic about Lady\nNavani’s plea.”\n“She is one of the most authentic people I know.” Dalinar smiled like a\nfool. “And she is good at getting what she wants.”\n“Let me lead you back to the Oathgate. We will be in contact about the\nPrime’s visit to your city.”\nDalinar collected his spanreed and bade farewell to Lift, who stood on\nthe back of the couch and waved to him. The sky looked brighter as the\nviziers accompanied him back to the dome that housed the Oathgate. He\ncould hear them speaking eagerly as they entered the rickshaws; they\nseemed to be embracing this decision with gusto, now that it had been\nmade.\nDalinar passed the trip quietly, worried that he might say something\nbrutish and ruin things. Once they entered the market dome, he did take the\nopportunity to mention to Noura that the Oathgate could be used to\ntransport everything there, including the dome itself.\n“I’m afraid that it’s a larger security threat than you know,” he finished\nsaying to her as they reached the control building.\n“What would it do,” she said, “if we built a structure halfway across the\nplateau perimeter? Would it slice the thing in two? What if a person is half\non, half off?”\n“That we don’t know yet,” Dalinar said, fumbling the spanreed on and\noff in a pattern to send the signal that would bring Jasnah back through the\nOathgate to fetch him.\n“I’ll admit,” Noura said softly as the other viziers chatted behind,\n“I’m … not pleased at being overruled. I am the emperor’s loyal servant,\nbut I do not like the idea of your Radiants, Dalinar Kholin. These powers\nare dangerous, and the ancient Radiants turned traitor in the end.”\n“I will convince you,” Dalinar said. “We will prove ourselves to you. All\nI need is a chance.”\nThe Oathgate flashed, and Jasnah appeared inside. Dalinar bowed to\nNoura in respect, then stepped backward into the building.\n“You are not what I expected, Blackthorn,” Noura said.\n“And what did you expect?”\n“An animal,” she said frankly. “A half-man creature of war and blood.”\nSomething about that struck him. An animal … Echoes of memories\nshuddered inside of him.\n“I was that man,” Dalinar said. “I’ve merely been blessed with enough\ngood examples to make me aspire to something more.” He nodded to\nJasnah, who repositioned her sword, rotating the inner wall to initiate the\ntransfer and take them back to Urithiru."

Dalinar stepped out and blinked at\nthe sunlight, chilled by the mountain cold. He smiled broadly at her,\nopening his mouth to tell her what her essay had done.\nAn animal … An animal reacts when it is prodded …\nMemories.\nYou whip it, and it becomes savage.\nDalinar stumbled.\nHe vaguely heard Navani crying out, yelling for help. His vision spun,\nand he fell to his knees, feeling an overwhelming nausea. He clawed at the\nstone, groaning, breaking fingernails. Navani … Navani was calling for a\nhealer. She thought he’d been poisoned.\nIt wasn’t that. No, it was far, far worse.\nStorms. He remembered. It came crashing down on him, the weight of a\nthousand boulders.\nHe remembered what had happened to Evi. It had started in a cold\nfortress, in highlands once claimed by Jah Keved.\nIt had ended at the Rift.\n66. Strategist\nELEVEN YEARS AGO\nDalinar’s breath misted as he leaned on the stone windowsill. In the room\nbehind him, soldiers set up a table with a map on it.\n“See there,” Dalinar said, pointing out the window. “That ledge down\nthere?”\nAdolin, now twelve years old—nearly thirteen—leaned out the window.\nThe outside of the large stone keep bulged here at the second floor, which\nwould make scaling it challenging—but the stonework provided a\nconvenient handhold in the form of a ledge right below the window.\n“I see it,” Adolin said.\n“Good. Now watch.” Dalinar gestured into the room. One of his guards\npulled a lever, and the stonework ledge retracted into the wall.\n“It moved!” Adolin said. “Do that again!”\nThe soldier obliged, using the lever to make the ledge stick out, then\nretract again.\n“Neat!” Adolin said. So full of energy, as always. If only Dalinar could\nharness that for the battlefield. He wouldn’t need Shards to conquer.\n“Why did they build that, do you think?” Dalinar asked.\n“In case people climb it! You could make them drop back down!”\n“Defense against Shardbearers,” Dalinar said, nodding. “A fall this far\nwould crack their Plate, but the fortress also has interior corridor sections\nthat are too narrow to maneuver in properly with Plate and Blade.”\nDalinar smiled. Who knew that such a gem had been hiding in the\nhighlands between Alethkar and Jah Keved? This solitary keep would\nprovide a nice barrier if true war ever did break out with the Vedens.\nHe gestured for Adolin to move back, then shuttered the window and\nrubbed his chilled hands. This chamber was decorated like a lodge, hung\nwith old forgotten greatshell trophies. At the side, a soldier stoked a flame\nin the hearth.\nThe battles with the Vedens had wound down.

        "text": "in the hearth.\nThe battles with the Vedens had wound down. Though the last few fights\nhad been disappointing, having his son with him had been an absolute\ndelight. Adolin hadn’t gone into battle, of course, but he’d joined them at\ntactics meetings. Dalinar had at first assumed the generals would be\nannoyed at the presence of a child, but it was hard to find little Adolin\nannoying. He was so earnest, so interested.\nTogether, he and Adolin joined a few of Dalinar’s lesser officers at the\nroom’s table map. “Now,” Dalinar said to Adolin, “let’s see how well\nyou’ve been paying attention. Where are we now?”\nAdolin leaned over, pointing at the map. “This is our new keep, which\nyou won for the crown! Here’s the old border, where it used to be. Here’s\nthe new border in blue, which we won back from those thieving Vedens.\nThey’ve held our land for twenty years.”\n“Excellent,” Dalinar said. “But it’s not merely land we’ve won.”\n“Trade treaties!” Adolin said. “That’s the point of the big ceremony we\nhad to do. You and that Veden highprince, in formal dress. We won the right\nto trade for tons of stuff for cheap.”\n“Yes, but that’s not the most important thing we won.”\nAdolin frowned. “Um … horses…”\n“No, son, the most important thing we’ve won is legitimacy. In signing\nthis new treaty, the Veden king has recognized Gavilar as the rightful king\nof Alethkar. We’ve not just defended our borders, we’ve forestalled a\ngreater war, as the Vedens now acknowledge our right to rule—and won’t\nbe pressing their own.”\nAdolin nodded, understanding.\nIt was gratifying to see how much one could accomplish in both politics\nand trade by liberally murdering the other fellow’s soldiers. These last years\nfull of skirmishes had reminded Dalinar of why he lived. More, they’d\ngiven him something new. In his youth, he’d warred, then spent the\nevenings drinking with his soldiers.\nNow he had to explain his choices, vocalize them for the ears of an eager\nyoung boy who had questions for everything—and expected Dalinar to\nknow the answers.\nStorms, it was a challenge. But it felt good. Incredibly good. He had no\nintention of ever returning to a useless life spent wasting away in Kholinar,\ngoing to parties and getting into tavern brawls. Dalinar smiled and accepted\na cup of warmed wine, surveying the map. Though Adolin had been focused\non the region where they were fighting the Vedens, Dalinar’s eyes were\ninstead drawn to another section.\nIt included, written in pencil, the numbers he’d requested: projections of\ntroops at the Rift.\n“Viim cachi eko!” Evi said, stepping into the room, holding her arms\ntight to her chest and shivering. “I had thought central Alethkar was cold.\nAdolin Kholin, where is your jacket?”\nThe boy looked down, as if suddenly surprised that he wasn’t wearing it.\n“Um…” He looked to Teleb, who merely smiled, shaking his head.\n“Run along, son,” Dalinar said. “You have geography lessons today.”"

I don’t want to leave you.”\nHe wasn’t speaking merely of today. The time was approaching when\nAdolin would go to spend part of the year in Kholinar, to drill with the\nswordmasters and receive formal training in diplomacy. He spent most of\nthe year with Dalinar, but it was important he get some refinement in the\ncapital.\n“Go,” Dalinar said. “If you pay attention in your lesson, I’ll take you\nriding tomorrow.”\nAdolin sighed, then saluted. He hopped off his stool and gave his mother\na hug—which was un-Alethi, but Dalinar suffered the behavior. Then he\nwas out the door.\nEvi stepped up to the fire. “So cold. What possessed someone to build a\nfortress way up here?”\n“It’s not that bad,” Dalinar said. “You should visit the Frostlands in a\nseason of winter.”\n“You Alethi cannot understand cold. Your bones are frozen.”\nDalinar grunted his response, then leaned down over the map. I’ll need\nto approach from the south, march up along the lake’s coast.…\n“The king is sending a message via spanreed,” Evi noted. “It’s being\nscribed now.”\nHer accent is fading, Dalinar noticed absently. When she sat down in a\nchair by the fire, she supported herself with her right hand, safehand tucked\ndemurely against her waist. She kept her blonde hair in Alethi braids, rather\nthan letting it tumble about her shoulders.\nShe’d never be a great scribe—she didn’t have the youthful training in\nart and letters of a Vorin woman. Besides, she didn’t like books, and\npreferred her meditations. But she’d tried hard these last years, and he was\nimpressed.\nShe still complained that he didn’t see Renarin enough. The other son\nwas unfit for battle, and spent most of his time in Kholinar. Evi spent half\nthe year back with him.\nNo, no, Dalinar thought, writing a glyph on the map. The coast is the\nexpected route. What then? An amphibious assault across the lake? He’d\nneed to see if he could get ships for that.\nA scribe eventually entered bearing the king’s letter, and everyone but\nDalinar and Evi left. Evi held the letter and hesitated. “Do you want to sit,\nor—”\n“No, go ahead.”\nEvi cleared her voice. “ ‘Brother,’ ” the letter began, “ ‘the treaty is\nsealed. Your efforts in Jah Keved are to be commended, and this should be a\ntime of celebration and congratulations. Indeed, on a personal note, I wish\nto express my pride in you. The word from our best generals is that your\ntactical instincts have matured to full-fledged strategic genius. I never\ncounted myself among their ranks, but to a man, they commend you as their\nequal.\n“ ‘As I have grown to become a king, it seems you have found your\nplace as our general.

It would be best if we could meet in person.\nOnce, I enjoyed your company every day. Now I believe it has been three\nyears since we last spoke face to face.’ ”\n“But,” Dalinar said, interrupting, “the Rift needs to be dealt with.”\nEvi broke off, looking at him, then back down at the page. She continued\nreading. “ ‘Unfortunately, our meeting will have to wait a few storms\nlonger. Though your efforts on the border have certainly helped solidify our\npower, I have failed to dominate Rathalas and its renegade leader with\npolitics.\n“ ‘I must send you to the Rift again. You are to quell this faction. Civil\nwar could tear Alethkar to shreds, and I dare not wait any longer. In truth, I\nwish I’d listened when we spoke—so many years ago—and you challenged\nme to send you to the Rift.\n“ ‘Sadeas will gather reinforcements and join you. Please send word of\nyour strategic assessment of the problem. Be warned, we are certain now\nthat one of the other highprinces—we don’t know who—is supporting\nTanalan and his rebellion. He may have access to Shards. I wish you\nstrength of purpose, and the Heralds’ own blessings, in your new task. With\nlove and respect, Gavilar.’ ”\nEvi looked up. “How did you know, Dalinar? You’ve been poring over\nthose maps for weeks—maps of the Crownlands and of Alethkar. You knew\nhe was going to assign you this task.”\n“What kind of strategist would I be if I couldn’t foresee the next battle?”\n“I thought we were going to relax,” Evi said. “We were going to be done\nwith the killing.”\n“With the momentum I have? What a waste that would be! If not for this\nproblem in Rathalas, Gavilar would have found somewhere else for me to\nfight. Herdaz again, perhaps. You can’t have your best general sitting\naround collecting crem.”\nBesides. There would be men and women among Gavilar’s advisors who\nworried about Dalinar. If anyone was a threat to the throne, it would be the\nBlackthorn—particularly with the respect he’d gained from the kingdom’s\ngenerals. Though Dalinar had decided years ago that he would never do\nsuch a thing, many at court would think the kingdom safer if he were kept\naway.\n“No, Evi,” he said as he made another notation, “I doubt we will ever\nsettle back in Kholinar again.”\nHe nodded to himself. That was the way to get the Rift. One of his\nmobile bands could round and secure the lake’s beach. He could move the\nentire army across it then, attacking far faster than the Rift expected.\nSatisfied, he looked up. And found Evi crying.\nThe sight stunned him, and he dropped his pencil.

Oh, they make sure to point out how superior their beliefs are\nto mine. But who actually ever worries about the Heralds, other than to\nswear by their names?

Just in case, she’d given a drawing of the thing she’d\nseen to the others, and warned them to watch.\nToday, she strolled into the little kitchen, which was beside the rear\nworkroom. Adolin ate flatbread and curry while King Elhokar sat at the\nroom’s table, earnestly … writing something? No, he was drawing.\nShallan rested fond fingers on Adolin’s shoulder and enjoyed his grin in\nresponse. Then she rounded to peek over the king’s shoulder. He was doing\na map of the city, with the palace and the Oathgate platform. It wasn’t half\nbad.\n“Anyone seen the bridgeman?” Elhokar asked."

Yokska, her\nhusband, and her maid were out shopping for more food, using spheres that\nElhokar had provided. Food was apparently still for sale in the city, if you\nhad the spheres to pay.\n“I,” Elhokar said, “have devised a plan for how to proceed in this city.”\nShallan shared a look with Adolin, who shrugged. “What do you suggest,\nYour Majesty?”\n“Thanks to the Lightweaver’s excellent reconnaissance,” the king said,\n“it is evident my wife is being held captive by her own guards.”\n“We don’t know that for certain, Your Majesty,” Kaladin said. “It\nsounded like the queen has succumbed to whatever is affecting the guards.”\n“Either way, she is in need of rescue,” Elhokar said. “Either we must\nsneak into the palace for her and little Gavinor, or we must rally a military\nforce to help us capture the location by strength of arms.” He tapped his\nmap of the city with his pen. “The Oathgate, however, remains our priority.\nBrightness Davar, I want you to investigate this Cult of Moments. Find out\nhow they’re using the Oathgate platform.”\nYokska had confirmed that each night, some members of the cult set a\nblazing fire on top of the platform. They guarded the place all hours of the\nday.\n“If you could join whatever ritual or event they are performing,” the king\nsaid, “you would be within feet of the Oathgate. You could transport the\nentire plateau to Urithiru, and let our armies there deal with the cult.\n“In case that is not viable, Adolin and I—in the guise of important\nlighteyes from the Shattered Plains—shall contact the lighteyed houses in\nthe city who maintain private guard forces. We shall gather their support,\nperhaps revealing our true identities, and put together an army for assaulting\nthe palace, if needed.”\n“And me?” Kaladin asked.\n“I don’t like the sound of this Azure person. See what you can find out\nabout him and his Wall Guard.”\nKaladin nodded, then grunted.\n“It’s a good plan, Elhokar,” Adolin said. “Nice work.”\nA simple compliment probably should not have made a king beam like it\ndid. Elhokar even drew a gloryspren—and notably, it didn’t seem different\nfrom ordinary ones.\n“But there is something we have to face,” Adolin continued. “Have you\nlistened to the list of charges that ardent—the one who got executed—made\nagainst the queen?”\n“I … Yes.”\n“Ten glyphs,” Adolin said, “denouncing Aesudan’s excess. Wasting food\nwhile people starved. Increasing taxes, then throwing lavish parties for her\nardents. Elhokar, this started long before the Everstorm.”\n“We can … ask her,” the king said. “Once she is safe. Something must\nhave been wrong. Aesudan was always proud, and always ambitious, but\nnever gluttonous.” He eyed Adolin. “I know that Jasnah says I shouldn’t"

Aesudan was always proud, and always ambitious, but\nnever gluttonous.” He eyed Adolin. “I know that Jasnah says I shouldn’t\nhave married her—that Aesudan was too hungry for power. Jasnah never\nunderstood. I needed Aesudan. Someone with strength…” He took a deep\nbreath, then stood up. “We mustn’t waste time. The plan. Do you agree with\nit?”\n“I like it,” Shallan said.\nKaladin nodded. “It’s too general, but it’s at least a line of attack.\nAdditionally, we need to trace the grain in the city. Yokska says the\nlighteyes provide it, but she also says the palace stores are closed.”\n“You think someone has a Soulcaster?” Adolin asked.\n“I think this city has too many secrets,” Kaladin said.\n“Adolin and I shall ask the lighteyes, and see if they know,” Elhokar\nsaid, then looked to Shallan. “The Cult of Moments?”\n“I’ll get on it,” she said. “I need a new coat anyway.”\n* * *\nShe slipped out of the building again as Veil. She wore the trousers and her\ncoat, though that now had a hole in the back. Ishnah had been able to wash\nthe blood off, but Veil still wanted to replace it. For now, she covered the\nhole with a Lightweaving.\nVeil sauntered down the street, and found herself feeling increasingly\nconfident. Back in Urithiru, she’d still been struggling to get her coat on\nstraight, so to speak. She winced as she thought of her trips through the\nbars, making a fool of herself. You didn’t need to prove how much you\ncould drink in order to look tough—but that was the sort of thing you\ncouldn’t learn without wearing the coat, living in it.\nShe turned toward the market, where she hoped to get a feel for\nKholinar’s people. She needed to know how they thought before she could\nbegin to understand how the Cult of Moments had come to be, and therefore\nhow to infiltrate it.\nThis market was very different from those at Urithiru, or the night\nmarkets of Kharbranth. First off, this one was obviously ancient. These\nworn, weathered shops felt like they’d been here for the first Desolation.\nThese were stones smoothed by the touch of a million fingers, or indented\nby the press of thousands of passing feet. Awnings bleached by the\nprogression of day after day.\nThe street was wide, and not crowded. Some stalls were empty, and the\nremaining merchants didn’t shout at her as she passed. These seemed effects\nof the smothered sensation everyone felt—the feeling of a city besieged.\nYokska served only men, and Veil wouldn’t have wanted to reveal\nherself to the woman anyway. So she stopped at a clothier and tried on\nsome new coats. She chatted with the woman who ran the accounts—her\nhusband was the actual tailor—and got some suggestions on where to look\nfor a coat matching her current one, then stepped back out onto the street.\nSoldiers in light blue patrolled here, the glyphs on their uniforms\nproclaiming them to be of House Velalant.

Yokska had described their\nbrightlord as a minor player in the city until so many lighteyes had vanished\ninto the palace.\nVeil shivered, remembering the line of corpses. Adolin and Elhokar were\nfairly certain those were the remnants of a distant Kholin and his attendants\n—a man named Kaves, who had often tried to gain power in the city.\nNeither were sad to see him go, but it whispered of a continuing mystery.\nMore than thirty people had gone to meet with the queen, many more\npowerful than Kaves. What had happened to them?\nShe passed an assortment of vendors peddling the usual range of\nnecessities and curiosities, from ceramics to dining wares, to fine knives. It\nwas nice to see that here, the soldiers had imposed some semblance of\norder. Perhaps rather than fixating on the closed stalls, Veil should have\nappreciated how many were still open.\nThe third clothing shop finally had a coat she liked, of the same style as\nher old one—white and long, past her knees. She paid to have it taken in,\nthen casually asked the seamstress about the city’s grain.\nThe answers led her one street over to a grain station. It had formerly\nbeen a Thaylen bank, with the words Secure Keeps across the top in\nThaylen and the women’s script. The proprietors had long ago fled—\nmoneylenders seemed to have a sixth sense for impending danger, the way\nsome animals could sense a storm hours before it arrived.\nThe soldiers in light blue had appropriated it, and the vaults now\nprotected precious grain. People waited in line outside, and at the front,\nsoldiers doled out enough lavis for one day’s flatbread and gruel.\nIt was a good sign—if a distinct and terrible reminder of the city’s\nsituation. She would have applauded Velalant’s kindness, save for his\nsoldiers’ blatant incompetence. They shouted at everyone to stay in line, but\ndidn’t do anything to enforce the order. They did have a scribe watching to\nmake sure nobody got in line twice, but they didn’t exclude people who\nwere obviously too well-to-do to need the handout.\nVeil glanced around the market, and noted people watching from the\ncrannies and hollows of abandoned stalls. The poor and unwanted, those\ndestitute beyond even the refugees. Tattered clothing, dirty faces. They\nwatched like spren drawn by a powerful emotion.\nVeil settled down on a low wall beside a drainage trough. A boy huddled\nnearby, watching the line with hungry eyes. One of his arms ended in a\ntwisted, unusable hand: three fingers mere nubs, the other two crooked.\nShe fished in her trouser pocket. Shallan didn’t carry food, but Veil knew\nthe importance of having something to chew on. She could have sworn\nshe’d tucked something in while getting ready.… There it was. A meat stick,\nSoulcast but flavored with sugar. Not quite large enough to be a sausage.\nShe bit off an end, then wagged the rest toward the urchin.\nThe boy sized her up, probably trying to determine her angle.

Finally he\ncrept over and took the offering, quickly stuffing the whole thing into his\nmouth. He waited, eyeing her to see if she had more.\n“Why don’t you get in line?” Veil asked.\n“They got rules. Gotta be a certain age. And if you’re too poor, they\nshove ya out of line.”\n“For what reason?”\nThe boy shrugged. “Don’t need one, I guess. They say you’ve already\nbeen through, ’cept you haven’t.”\n“Many of those people … they’re servants from wealthy homes, aren’t\nthey?”\nThe urchin nodded.\nStorming lighteyes, Veil thought as she watched. Some of the poor were\nshoved out of line for one infraction or another, as the urchin had claimed.\nThe others waited patiently, as it was their job. They’d been sent by wealthy\nhomes to collect food. Many bore the lean, strong look of house guards,\nthough they didn’t wear uniforms.\nStorms. Velalant’s men really had no idea how to do this. Or maybe they\nknow exactly what they’re doing, she thought. And Velalant is just keeping\nthe local lighteyes happy and ready to support his rule, should the winds\nturn his way.\nIt made Veil sick. She fished out a second meat stick for the urchin, then\nstarted to ask him how far Velalant’s influence reached—but the kid was\ngone in a heartbeat.\nThe grain distribution ended, and a lot of unhappy people called out in\ndespair. The soldiers said they’d do another handout in the evening, and\ncounseled people to line up and wait. Then the bank closed its doors.\nBut where did Velalant get the food? Veil rose and continued through the\nmarket, passing pools of angerspren. Some looked like the normal pools of\nblood; others were more like tar, pitch-black. When the bubbles in these\npopped, they showed a burning red within, like embers. Those vanished as\npeople settled down to wait—and exhaustionspren appeared instead.\nHer optimism about the market evaporated. She passed crowds milling\nabout, looking lost, and read depression in people’s eyes. Why try to\npretend life could go on? They were doomed. The Voidbringers were going\nto rip this city apart—if they didn’t simply let everyone starve.\nSomeone needed to do something. Veil needed to do something.\nInfiltrating the Cult of Moments suddenly seemed too abstract. Couldn’t she\ndo something directly for these poor people? Except … she hadn’t even\nbeen able to save her own family. She had no idea what Mraize had done\nwith her brothers, and she refused to think about them. How would she save\nan entire city?\nShe shouldered through the crowd, seeking freedom, suddenly feeling\ntrapped. She needed out. She—\nWhat was that sound?\nShallan pulled up short, turning, hearing. Storms. It couldn’t be, could\nit? She drifted toward the sound, that voice.\n“You say that, my dear man,” it proclaimed, “but everyone thinks they\nknow the moons. How could they not? We live beneath their gaze each"

We live beneath their gaze each\nnight. We’ve known them longer than our friends, our wives, our children.\nAnd yet … and yet…”\nShallan pushed through the milling crowd to find him sitting on the low\nwall around a storm cistern. A metal brazier burned before him, emitting\nthin lines of smoke that twisted in the wind. He was dressed, strangely, in a\nsoldier’s uniform—Sadeas’s livery, with the coat unbuttoned and a colored\nscarf around his neck.\nThe traveler. The one they called the King’s Wit. Angular features, a\nsharp nose, hair that was stark black.\nHe was here.\n“There are still stories to tell.” Wit leaped to his feet. Few people were\npaying attention. To them, he was just another busker. “Everyone knows\nthat Mishim is the cleverest of the three moons. Though her sister and\nbrother are content to reign in the sky—gracing the lands below with their\nlight—Mishim is always looking for a chance to escape her duty.”\nWit tossed something into the brazier, producing a bright green puff of\nsmoke the color of Mishim, the third and slowest of the moons.\n“This story takes place during the days of Tsa,” Wit continued. “The\ngrandest queen of Natanatan, before that kingdom’s fall. Blessed with grand\npoise and beauty, the Natan people were famous across all of Roshar. Why,\nif you’d lived back then, you’d have viewed the east as a place of great\nculture, not an empty wasteland!\n“Queen Tsa, as you’ve doubtless heard, was an architect. She designed\nhigh towers for her city, built to reach ever upward, grasping toward the\nsky. One night, Tsa rested in her greatest tower, enjoying the view. So it was\nthat Mishim, that clever moon, happened to pass in the sky close by. (It was\na night when the moons were large, and these—everyone knows—are\nnights when the moons pay special attention to the actions of mortals.)\n“ ‘Great Queen!’ Mishim called. ‘You build such fine towers in your\ngrand city. I enjoy viewing them each night as I pass.’ ”\nWit dropped powder into the brazier, this time in clumps that caused two\nlines of smoke—one white, one green—to stream upward. Shallan stepped\nforward, watching the smoke curl. The marketgoers slowed, and began to\ngather.\n“Now,” Wit said, thrusting his hands into the smoke lines, twisting them\nso that the smoke swirled and contorted, giving the sense of a green moon\nspinning in the center, “Queen Tsa was hardly ignorant of Mishim’s crafty\nways. The Natans were never fond of Mishim, but rather revered the great\nNomon.\n“Still, one does not ignore a moon. ‘Thank you, Great Celestial One,’ Tsa\ncalled. ‘Our engineers labor ceaselessly to erect the most splendid of mortal\naccomplishments.’\n“ ‘Almost they reach to my domain,’ Mishim called. ‘One wonders if\nyou are trying to obtain it.’"

His other hand swirled a pocket of green above it,\nlike a whirlpool. A tower and a moon.\nThat can’t be natural, can it? Shallan thought. Is he Lightweaving? Yet\nshe saw no Stormlight. There was something more … organic about what\nhe did. She couldn’t be completely certain it was supernatural.\n“As always, Mishim was hatching a scheme. She loathed being hung in\nthe sky each night, far from the delights of the world below, and the\npleasures that only mortals know. The next night, Mishim again passed\nQueen Tsa in her tower. ‘It is a pity,’ Mishim said, ‘that you cannot see the\nconstellations from up close. For they are truly beautiful gemstones, shaped\nby the finest of gem cutters.’\n“ ‘It is a pity,’ Tsa said. ‘But all know that the eyes of a mortal would\nburn to see such a lofty sight.’\n“On the next night, Mishim tried again. ‘It is a pity,’ she said, ‘that you\ncannot converse with the starspren, as they tell delightsome stories.’\n“ ‘It is a pity,’ Tsa agreed. ‘But everyone knows that the language of the\nheavens would drive a mortal mad.’\n“The next night, Mishim tried a third time. ‘It is a pity that you cannot\nsee the beauty of your kingdom from above. For the pillars and domes of\nyour city are radiant.’\n“ ‘It is a pity,’ Tsa agreed. ‘But those sights are meant for the great ones\nof heaven, and to behold them myself would be blasphemous.’ ”\nWit dropped another powder into the brazier, bringing up yellow-gold\nsmoke. By now, dozens of people had gathered to watch. He swept his\nhands to the sides, sending the smoke spraying out in a flat plane. Then it\ncrept upward again in lines—forming towers. A city?\nHe continued to swirl with one hand, drawing the green smoke up into a\nring that—with a thrust of his hand—he sent spinning across the top of the\nyellow-golden city. It was remarkable, and Shallan found her jaw dropping.\nThis was an image that lived.\nWit glanced to the side, where he’d put his pack. He started, as if\nsurprised. Shallan cocked her head as he quickly recovered, jumping back\ninto the story so fast that it was easy to miss his lapse. But now, as he spoke,\nhe searched the audience with careful eyes.\n“Mishim,” he said, “was not finished. The queen was pious, but the\nmoon was crafty. I will leave it to you to decide which is the more\npowerful.

He let the smoke dwindle, the powders he’d thrown running out, all\nsave the line of green.\n“ ‘What?’ Tsa said. ‘A flawed tower? Which one?’\n“ ‘It is but a minor blemish,’ Mishim said. ‘Do not let it worry you. I\nappreciate the effort your craftsmen, however incompetent, put into their\nwork.’ She continued on her way, but knew that she had trapped the queen.\n“Indeed, on the next night, the beautiful queen stood waiting on her\nbalcony. ‘Great One of the Heavens!’ Tsa called. ‘We have inspected the\nroofs, and cannot find the imperfection! Please, please tell me which tower\nit is, so I can break it down.’\n“ ‘I cannot say,’ Mishim said. ‘To be mortal is to be flawed; it is not right\nto expect perfection of you.’\n“This only made the queen more worried. On the next night, she asked,\n‘Great One of the Sky, is there a way that I could visit the heavens? I will\nclose my ears to the stories of the starspren and turn my eyes away from the\nconstellations. I would look only upon the flawed works of my people, not\nthe sights meant for you, so that I may see with my own eyes what must be\nfixed.’\n“ ‘It is a forbidden thing that you ask,’ Mishim said, ‘for we would have\nto trade places, and hope that Nomon does not notice.’ She said it with\nmuch glee, though hidden, for this request was the very thing she desired.\n“ ‘I will feign that I am you,’ Tsa promised. ‘And I will do all that you\ndo. We will switch back once I am done, and Nomon will never know.’ ”\nWit grinned broadly. “And so, the moon and the woman traded places.”\nHis raw enthusiasm for the story was infectious, and Shallan found herself\nsmiling.\nThey were at war, the city was falling, but all she wanted to do was listen\nto the end of this story.\nWit used powders to send up four different smoke lines—blue, yellow,\ngreen, and intense orange. He swirled them together in a transfixing vortex\nof hues. And as he worked, his blue eyes fell on Shallan. They narrowed,\nand his smile became sly.\nHe just recognized me, she realized. I’m still wearing Veil’s face. But\nhow … how did he know?\nWhen he finished his swirling colors, the moon had become white, and\nthe single straight tower he made by swiping up in the smoke was instead\npale green.\n“Mishim came down among the mortals,” he proclaimed, “and Tsa\nclimbed the heavens to sit in the place of the moon!

She passed the day in great disquiet, knowing that Tsa would be\ntrapped with her wise sister and solemn brother, spending the day in the\nplace where moons rest. When night again came, Mishim hid inside the\ntower, expecting that Salas would call out and chide her for her appetites.\nYet Salas passed without comment.\n“Surely, when Nomon rose, he would lash out against her foolishness.\nYet Nomon passed without comment. Finally, Tsa rose in the sky, and\nMishim called to her. ‘Queen Tsa, mortal, what has happened? My siblings\ndid not call to me. Did you somehow go undiscovered?’\n“ ‘No,’ Tsa replied. ‘Your siblings knew me as an impostor immediately.’\n“ ‘Then let us trade places quickly!’ Mishim said. ‘So that I may tell\nthem lies and placate them.’\n“ ‘They are placated already,’ Tsa said. ‘They think I am delightful.

I love those stories, and those sights.’\n“ ‘I think,’ Tsa said, ‘that I might stay.’ ”\nWit let the smoke fail until only a single line of green remained. It\nshrank down, dwindling, almost out.

The queen climbed back down\ninto her tower, and Mishim scrambled up into the heavens. With great\npleasure, she sank toward the horizon. Though just before she set, Mishim\nheard a song.”\nOddly, Wit added a small line of blue smoke to the brazier.\n“It was a song of laughter, of beauty. A song Mishim had never heard! It\ntook her long to understand that song, until months later, she passed in the\nsky at night and saw the queen in the tower again. Holding a child with skin\nthat was faintly blue.\n“They did not speak, but Mishim knew. The queen had tricked her. Tsa\nhad wanted to spend one day in the heavens, to know Nomon for a night.\nShe had given birth to a son with pale blue skin, the color of Nomon\nhimself. A son born of the gods, who would lead her people to glory. A son\nwho bore the mantle of the heavens.\n“And that is why to this day, the people of Natanatan have skin of a\nfaintly blue shade.

People waited,\nstunned, until a few started yelling for more. Wit remained silent. He bore\ntheir requests, their pleas, then their curses.\nSlowly, the audience drifted away.\nEventually, only Shallan stood before him.\nWit smiled at her.\n“Why that story?” she asked. “Why now?”\n“I don’t give the meanings, child,” he said. “You should know that by\nnow. I just tell the tale.”\n“It was beautiful.”\n“Yes,” he said. Then he added, “I miss my flute.”\n“Your what?”\nHe hopped up and began gathering his things. Shallan slipped forward\nand glanced inside his pack, catching sight of a small jar, sealed at the top.\nIt was mostly black, but the side pointed toward her was instead white.\nWit snapped the pack closed. “Come.

Of what, I did not say, as I\ndid not wish to sully my tongue.”\n“Where are my patrons, you idiot!”\nWit stepped to the side, holding out his hands toward Shallan. “Behold,\nmighty and terrible king, I have recruited you a subject.”\nThe innkeeper squinted at her. “Can she pay?”\n“Yes,” Wit said, holding up Shallan’s purse and poking through it.\n“She’ll probably leave a tip too.”\nWith a start, Shallan felt at her pocket. Storms, she’d even kept her hand\non that purse most of the day.\n“Take the private room then,” the innkeeper said. “It’s not like anyone\nelse is using it. Idiot bard. I’ll expect a good performance out of you\ntonight!”\nWit sighed, tossing Shallan her purse. He seized his pack and brazier,\nleading her to a chamber beside the main dining room. As he ushered her in,\nhe raised a fist toward the innkeeper. “I’ve had enough of your oppression,\ntyrant! Secure your wine well this evening, for the revolution will be swift,\nvengeful, and intoxicated!”\nClosing the door behind him, Wit shook his head. “That man really\nshould know better by now. I have no idea why he continues to put up with\nme.” He set his brazier and pack by the wall, then settled at the room’s\ndining table, where he leaned back and put his boots up on the seat next to\nhim.\nShallan sat at the table more delicately, Pattern slipping off her coat and\nacross to dimple the tabletop next to her. Wit didn’t react to the spren.\nThe room was nice, with painted wood panels set into the walls and\nrockbuds along a ledge near the small window. The table even had a yellow\nsilk tablecloth. The room was obviously meant for lighteyes to enjoy private\ndining, while unsavory darkeyes ate out in the main chamber.\n“That’s a nice illusion,” Wit said. “You got the back of the head right.\nPeople always flub the back. You’ve broken character though. You’re\nwalking like a prim lighteyes, which looks silly in that costume. You’ll only\nbe able to pull off a coat and hat if you own them.”\n“I know,” she said, grimacing. “The persona … fled once you recognized\nme.”\n“Shame about the dark hair. Your natural red would be arresting with the\nwhite coat.”\n“This guise is supposed to be less memorable than that.”\nHe glanced at the hat, which she’d set on the table. Shallan blushed.

One without so many references to the things you’ve\nmistaken for young maidens…”\n“Storming idiot,” the man said. He set the drinks on the table, and didn’t\nnotice that Pattern rippled out from under one. The innkeeper bustled out,\nclosing the door.\n“Are you one of them?” Shallan blurted out. “Are you a Herald, Wit?”\nPattern hummed softly.\n“Heavens no,” Wit said. “I’m not stupid enough to get mixed up in\nreligion again. The last seven times I tried it were all disasters. I believe\nthere’s at least one god still worshipping me by accident.”\nShe eyed him. It was always hard to tell which of Wit’s exaggerations\nwere supposed to mean something and which were confusing distractions.\n“Then what are you?”\n“Some men, as they age, grow kinder. I am not one of those, for I have\nseen how the cosmere can mistreat the innocent—and that leaves me\ndisinclined toward kindness. Some men, as they age, grow wiser. I am not\none of those, for wisdom and I have always been at cross-purposes, and I\nhave yet to learn the tongue in which she speaks. Some men, as they age,\ngrow more cynical. I, fortunately, am not one of those. If I were, the very air\nwould warp around me, sucking in all emotion, leaving only scorn.”\nHe tapped the table. “Other men … other men, as they age, merely grow\nstranger. I fear that I am one of those. I am the bones of a foreign species\nleft drying on the plain that was once, long ago, a sea. A curiosity, perhaps a\nreminder, that all has not always been as it is now.”\n“You’re … old, aren’t you? Not a Herald, but as old as they are?”\nHe slid his boots off the chair and leaned forward, holding her eyes. He\nsmiled in a kindly way. “Child, when they were but babes, I had already\nlived dozens of lifetimes. ‘Old’ is a word you use for worn shoes. I’m\nsomething else entirely.”\nShe trembled, looking into those blue eyes. Shadows played within\nthem. Shapes moved, and were worn down by time. Boulders became dust.\nMountains became hills. Rivers changed course. Seas became deserts.\n“Storms,” she whispered.\n“When I was young…” he said.\n“Yes?”\n“I made a vow.”\nShallan nodded, wide-eyed.\n“I said I’d always be there when I was needed.”\n“And you have been?”\n“Yes.”\nShe breathed out.\n“It turns out I should have been more specific, as ‘there’ is technically\nanywhere.”\n“It … what?”\n“To be honest, ‘there’ has—so far—been a random location that is of\nabsolutely no use to anyone.”\nShallan hesitated. In an instant, whatever she seemed to have sensed in\nWit was gone. She flopped back in her seat. “Why am I talking to you of all\npeople?”"

I even like\nsome of them.”\n“Be careful. People who aren’t me are prone to spontaneous bouts of\nsincerity.”\n“Which is bad?”\n“Of course! ‘Sincerity’ is a word people use to justify their chronic\ndullness.”\n“Well, I like sincere people,” Shallan said, raising her cup. “It’s\ndelightful how surprised they look when you push them down the stairs.”\n“Now, that’s unkind. You shouldn’t push people down the stairs for\nbeing sincere. You push people down the stairs for being stupid.”\n“What if they’re sincere and stupid?”\n“Then you run.”\n“I quite like arguing with them instead. They do make me look smart,\nand Vev knows I need the help.…”\n“No, no. You should never debate an idiot, Shallan. No more than you’d\nuse your best sword to spread butter.”\n“Oh, but I’m a scholar. I enjoy things with curious properties, and\nstupidity is most interesting. The more you study it, the further it flees—and\nyet the more of it you obtain, the less you understand about it!”\nWit sipped his drink. “True, to an extent. But it can be hard to spot, as—\nlike body odor—you never notice your own. That said … put two smart\npeople together, and they will eventually find their common stupidity, and in\nso doing become idiots.”\n“Like a child, it grows the more you feed it.”\n“Like a fashionable dress, it can be fetching in youth, but looks\nparticularly bad on the aged. And unique though its properties may be,\nstupidity is frighteningly common. The sum total of stupid people is\nsomewhere around the population of the planet. Plus one.”\n“Plus one?” Shallan asked.\n“Sadeas counts twice.”\n“Um … he’s dead, Wit.”\n“What?” Wit sat up straight.\n“Someone murdered him. Er … we don’t know who.” Aladar’s\ninvestigators had continued hunting the culprit, but the investigation had\nstalled by the time Shallan left.\n“Someone offed old Sadeas, and I missed it?”\n“What would you have done? Helped him?”\n“Storms, no. I’d have applauded.”\nShallan grinned and let out a deep sigh. Her hair had reverted to red—\nshe’d let the illusion lapse. “Wit,” she said, “why are you here? In the city?”\n“I’m not completely sure.”\n“Please. Could you just answer?”\n“I did—and I was honest. I can know where I’m supposed to be, Shallan,\nbut not always what I’m supposed to do there.” He tapped the table. “Why\nare you here?”\n“To open the Oathgate,” Shallan said. “Save the city.”\nPattern hummed.\n“Lofty goals,” Wit said.\n“What’s the point of goals, if not to spur you to something lofty?”"

Aim for the sun. That way if you miss, at least your arrow will\nfall far away, and the person it kills will likely be someone you don’t\nknow.”\nThe innkeeper chose that moment to arrive with some food. Shallan\ndidn’t feel particularly hungry; seeing all those starving people outside had\nstolen her appetite.\nThe small plates held crumbly cakes of Soulcast grain topped with a\nsingle steamed cremling—a variety known as a skrip, with a flat tail, two\nlarge claws, and long antennae. Eating cremlings wasn’t uncommon, but it\nwasn’t particularly fine dining.\nThe only difference between Shallan’s meal and Wit’s was the sauce—\nhers sweet, his spicy, though his had the sauce in a cup at the side. Food\nsupplies were tight, and the kitchen wasn’t preparing both masculine and\nfeminine dishes.\nThe innkeeper frowned at her hair, then shook his head and left. She got\nthe impression he was accustomed to oddities around Wit.\nShallan looked down at her food. Could she give this to someone else?\nSomeone who deserved it more than she did?\n“Eat up,” Wit said, rising and walking to the small window. “Don’t waste\nwhat you’re given.”\nReluctantly, she did as he instructed. It wasn’t particularly good, but it\nwasn’t terrible. “Aren’t you going to eat?” she asked.\n“I’m smart enough not to follow my own advice, thank you very much.”\nHe sounded distracted. Outside the window, a procession from the Cult of\nMoments was passing.\n“I want to learn to be like you,” Shallan said, feeling silly as she said it.\n“No you don’t.”\n“You’re funny, and charming, and—”\n“Yes, yes. I’m so storming clever that half the time, even I can’t follow\nwhat I’m talking about.”\n“—and you change things, Wit. When you came to me, in Jah Keved,\nyou changed everything. I want to be able to do that. I want to be able to\nchange the world.”\nHe didn’t seem at all interested in his food. Does he eat? she wondered.\nOr is he … like some kind of spren?\n“Who came with you to the city?” he asked her.\n“Kaladin. Adolin. Elhokar. Some of our servants.”\n“King Elhokar? Here?”\n“He’s determined to save the city.”\n“Most days, Elhokar has trouble saving face, let alone cities.”\n“I like him,” Shallan said. “Despite his … Elhokarness.”\n“He does grow on you, I suppose. Like a fungus.”\n“He really wants to do what is right. You should hear him talk about it\nlately. He wants to be remembered as a good king.”\n“Vanity.”\n“You don’t care about how you’ll be remembered?”\n“I’ll remember myself, which is enough. Elhokar though, he worries\nabout the wrong things.

Elhokar wears a simple crown because he\nworries that something more lavish might make people look at it, instead of\nat him. He doesn’t want the competition.”\nWit turned away from his inspection of the hearth and chimney. “You\nwant to change the world, Shallan. That’s well and good. But be careful.\nThe world predates you. She has seniority.”\n“I’m a Radiant,” Shallan said, shoving another forkful of crumbly, sweet\nbread into her mouth. “Saving the world is in the job description.”\n“Then be wise about it. There are two kinds of important men, Shallan.\nThere are those who, when the boulder of time rolls toward them, stand up\nin front of it and hold out their hands. All their lives, they’ve been told how\ngreat they are. They assume the world itself will bend to their whims as\ntheir nurse did when fetching them a fresh cup of milk.\n“Those men end up squished.\n“Other men stand to the side when the boulder of time passes, but are\nquick to say, ‘See what I did! I made the boulder roll there. Don’t make me\ndo it again!’\n“These men end up getting everyone else squished.”\n“Is there not a third type of person?”\n“There is, but they are oh so rare. These know they can’t stop the\nboulder. So they walk beside it, study it, and bide their time. Then they\nshove it—ever so slightly—to create a deviation in its path.\n“These are the men … well, these are the men who actually change the\nworld. And they terrify me. For men never see as far as they think they do.”\nShallan frowned, then looked at her empty plate. She hadn’t thought she\nwas hungry, but once she’d started eating …\nWit walked past and deftly lifted her plate away, then swapped it with his\nfull one.\n“Wit … I can’t eat that.”\n“Don’t be persnickety,” he said. “How are you going to save the world if\nyou starve yourself?”\n“I’m not starving myself.” But she took a little bite to satisfy him. “You\nmake it sound like having the power to change the world is a bad thing.”\n“Bad? No. Abhorrent, depressing, ghastly. Having power is a terrible\nburden, the worst thing imaginable, except for every other alternative.” He\nturned and studied her. “What is power to you, Shallan?”\n“It’s…” Shallan cut at the cremling, separating it from its shell. “It’s\nwhat I said earlier—the ability to change things.”\n“Things?”\n“Other people’s lives. Power is the ability to make life better or worse\nfor the people around you.”\n“And yourself too, of course.”\n“I don’t matter.”\n“You should.”\n“Selflessness is a Vorin virtue, Wit.”\n“Oh, bother that. You’ve got to live life, Shallan, enjoy life. Drink of\nwhat you’re proposing to give everyone else! That’s what I do.”\n“You … do seem to enjoy yourself a great deal.”"

Her cup was empty, but Wit\nwalked past and put his in her hand. She gulped it down.\n“Power is a knife,” Wit said, taking his seat. “A terrible, dangerous knife\nthat can’t be wielded without cutting yourself. We joked about stupidity, but\nin reality most people aren’t stupid. Many are simply frustrated at how little\ncontrol they have over their lives. They lash out. Sometimes in spectacular\nways…”\n“The Cult of Moments. They reportedly claim to see a transformed\nworld coming upon us.”\n“Be wary of anyone who claims to be able to see the future, Shallan.”\n“Except you, of course. Didn’t you say you can see where you need to\nbe?”\n“Be wary,” he repeated, “of anyone who claims to be able to see the\nfuture, Shallan.”\nPattern rippled on the table, not humming, only changing more quickly,\nforming new shapes in a rapid sequence. Shallan swallowed. To her\nsurprise, her plate was empty again. “The cult has control of the Oathgate\nplatform,” she said. “Do you know what they do up there every night?”\n“They feast,” Wit said softly, “and party. There are two general divisions\namong them. The common members wander the streets, moaning,\npretending to be spren. But others up on the platform actually know the\nspren—specifically, the creature known as the Heart of the Revel.”\n“One of the Unmade.”\nWit nodded. “A dangerous foe, Shallan. The cult reminds me of a group I\nknew long ago. Equally dangerous, equally foolish.”\n“Elhokar wants me to infiltrate them. Get onto that platform and activate\nthe Oathgate. Is it possible?”\n“Perhaps.” Wit settled back. “Perhaps. I can’t make the gate work; the\nspren of the fabrial won’t obey me. You have the proper key, and the cult\ntakes new members eagerly. Consumes them, like a fire needing new logs.”\n“How? What do I do?”\n“Food,” he said. “Their proximity to the Heart drives them to feast and\ncelebrate.”\n“Drinking in life?” she said, quoting his sentiment from earlier.\n“No. Hedonism has never been enjoyment, Shallan, but the opposite.\nThey take the wonderful things of life and indulge until they lose savor. It’s\nlistening to beautiful music, performed so loud as to eliminate all subtlety—\ntaking something beautiful and making it carnal. Yet their feasting does give\nyou an opening. I’ve brushed against their leaders—despite my best efforts.\nBring them food for the revel, and I can get you in. A warning, however,\nsimple Soulcast grain won’t satisfy them.”\nA challenge, then. “I should get back to the others.” She looked up to\nWit. “Would you … come with me? Join us?”"

Learn why.” He stepped back from the door and\npressed himself against the wall. “Also, tell the innkeeper I disappeared in a\npuff of smoke. It will drive him crazy.”\n“The inn—”\nThe door opened suddenly, swinging inward. The innkeeper entered, and\nhesitated as he found Shallan sitting alone at the table. Wit slipped deftly\naround the door and out behind the man, who didn’t notice.\n“Damnation,” the innkeeper said, searching around. “I don’t suppose\nhe’s going to work tonight?”\n“I have no idea.”\n“He said he’d treat me like a king.”\n“Well, he’s keeping that promise…”\nThe innkeeper took the plates, then bustled out. Conversations with Wit\nhad a way of ending in an odd manner. And, well, starting in an odd\nmanner. Odd all around.\n“Do you know anything about Wit?” she asked Pattern.\n“No,” Pattern said. “He feels like … mmm … one of us.”\nShallan fished in her pouch for some spheres—Wit had stolen a few, she\nnoted—as a tip for the poor innkeeper. Then she made her way back to the\ntailor’s shop, planning how to use her team to get the requisite food.\n69.

That little storm raged inside him, rising from his skin, haunting the\nspace behind his eyes and making them glow. Fortunately—though he stood\nin a busy market square—this tiny amount of Stormlight wouldn’t be\nenough for people to see in the bright sunlight.\nThe storm was a primal dance, an ancient song, an eternal battle that had\nraged since Roshar was new. It wanted to be used. He acquiesced, kneeling\nto infuse a small stone. He Lashed it upward just enough to make it tremble,\nbut not enough to send it zipping into the air.\nThe eerie screams came soon after. People started to shout in panic.\nKaladin ducked away, exhaling his Stormlight and becoming—hopefully—\nmerely another bystander. He crouched with Shallan and Adolin behind a\nplanter.

The\nslow ones simply huddled down beside the walls, hands over their heads.\nThe spren arrived as two lines of bright yellow-white, twisting about one\nanother above the plaza. Their inhuman screeches were awful. Like … like\nthe sound of a wounded animal, dying alone in the wilderness.\nThose weren’t the spren he’d seen while traveling with Sah and the other\nparshmen. That one had seemed more akin to a windspren; these looked\nlike vivid yellow spheres crackling with energy. They didn’t seem to be able\nto pinpoint the rock directly, and spun over the courtyard as if confused,\nstill screaming.\nA short time later, a figure descended from the sky. A Voidbringer in\nloose red and black clothing that rippled and churned in the breeze. He\ncarried a spear and a tall, triangular shield.\nThat spear, Kaladin thought. Long, with a slender point for puncturing\narmor, it was like a horseman’s lance. He found himself nodding. That\nwould be an excellent weapon for using in flight, where you’d need extra\nreach to attack men on the ground, or even enemies soaring around you.\nThe spren ceased screaming. The Voidbringer looked about, fluttering\nthrough the air, then glared at the spren and said something. Again, they\nseemed confused. They’d sensed Kaladin’s use of Stormlight—likely\ninterpreted it as a fabrial being used—but now couldn’t pinpoint the\nlocation. Kaladin had used such a small amount of Stormlight, the rock had\nlost its charge almost immediately.\nThe spren dispersed, vanishing as emotion spren often did. The\nVoidbringer lingered, surrounded by dark energy, until horns nearby\nannounced the Wall Guard approaching. The creature finally shot back into\nthe air. People who had been hiding scuttled away, looking relieved to have\nescaped with their lives.\n“Huh,” Adolin said, standing. He wore an illusion, imitating—as per\nElhokar’s instructions—Captainlord Meleran Khal, Teshav’s youngest son,\na powerfully built balding man in his thirties.\n“I can hold Stormlight as long as I want without drawing attention,”\nKaladin said. “The moment I Lash something, they come screaming.”\n“And yet,” Adolin said, glancing at Shallan, “the disguises draw no\nattention.”\n“Pattern says we’re quieter than him,” Shallan said, thumbing toward\nKaladin. “Come on, let’s get back. Don’t you boys have an appointment\ntonight?”\n* * *\n“A party,” Kaladin said, pacing back and forth in the tailor shop’s\nshowroom. Skar and Drehy leaned by the doorway, each with a spear in the\ncrook of his arm.\n“This is what they’re like,” Kaladin said. “Your city is practically\nburning. What should you do? Throw a party, obviously.”\nElhokar had suggested parties as a way of contacting the city’s lighteyed\nfamilies. Kaladin had laughed at the idea, assuming that there wouldn’t be\nsuch a thing. Yet, with minimal searching, Adolin had scrounged up half a\ndozen invitations.\n“Good darkeyed people slave away, growing and preparing food,”"

He was wearing a ruffled shirt under a powder-blue suit with a\njacket that didn’t close all the way and tails at the back. Its golden\nembroidery was the finest the shop could provide.\n“Please tell me,” Kaladin said, “that you didn’t bring us to live with your\ntailor because you wanted a new wardrobe.”\n“Come on, Kal,” Adolin said, inspecting himself in a showroom mirror.\n“I need to look the part.” He checked his cuffs and grinned again.\nYokska came out and looked him over, then dusted his shoulders. “I\nthink it pulls too tightly through the chest, Brightlord.”\n“It’s wonderful, Yokska.”\n“Take a deep breath.”\nIt was like she was a storming surgeon, the way she lifted his arm and\nfelt at his waist, muttering to herself. Kaladin had seen his father give\nphysicals that were less invasive.\n“I thought that straight coats were still the style,” Adolin said. “I have a\nfolio out of Liafor.”\n“Those aren’t up to date,” Yokska said. “I was in Liafor last Midpeace,\nand they’re moving away from military styles. But they made those folios\nto sell uniforms at the Shattered Plains.”\n“Storms! I had no idea how unfashionable I was being.”\nKaladin rolled his eyes. Adolin saw that in the mirror, but just turned\naround, giving a bow. “Don’t worry, bridgeboy. You can continue to wear\nclothing to match your scowl.”\n“You look like you tripped and fell into a bucket of blue paint,” Kaladin\nsaid, “then tried to dry off with a handful of parched grass.”\n“And you look like what the storm leaves behind,” Adolin said, passing\nby and patting Kaladin on the shoulder. “We like you anyway. Every boy\nhas a favorite stick he found out in the yard after the rains.”\nAdolin stepped over to Skar and Drehy, clasping hands with each of\nthem in turn. “You two looking forward to tonight?”\n“Depends on how the food is in the darkeyed tent, sir,” Skar said.\n“Swipe me something from the inner party,” Drehy said. “I hear they’ve\ngot storming good pastries at those fancy lighteyes parties.”\n“Sure.

She gave Adolin a kiss\nthat was more intimate than Kaladin had seen from the two of them before,\nthen changed him back into Meleran Khal. Elhokar became an older man,\nalso bald, with pale yellow eyes. General Khal, one of Dalinar’s highest\nofficers.\n“I’m fine,” Kaladin said as she eyed him. “Nobody is going to recognize\nme.”\nHe wasn’t sure what it was, but wearing another face like that … to him\nit felt like lying.\n“The scars,” Elhokar said. “We need you not to stand out, Captain.”\nReluctantly, Kaladin nodded, and allowed Shallan to add a Lightweaving\nto his head to make the slave brands vanish. Then, she handed each of them\na sphere. The illusions were tied to the Stormlight inside of those—if the\nsphere ran out, their false faces would vanish.\nThe group set out, Skar and Drehy joining them, spears at the ready. Syl\nflitted out from an upper window of the shop, soaring on ahead of them\nalong the street. Kaladin had tested summoning her as a Blade earlier, and\nthat hadn’t drawn the screamers, so he felt well-armed.\nAdolin immediately started joking with Skar and Drehy. Dalinar\nwouldn’t have liked to hear they’d gone out drinking. Not because of any\nspecific prejudice, but there was a command structure to an army. Generals\nweren’t supposed to fraternize with the rank and file; it threw wrinkles into\nhow armies worked.\nAdolin could get away with things like that. As he listened, Kaladin\nfound himself feeling ashamed of his earlier attitude. The truth was, he was\nfeeling pretty good these days. Yes, there was a war, and yes, the city was\nseriously stressed—but ever since he’d found his parents alive and well,\nhe’d been feeling better.\nThat wasn’t so uncommon a feeling for him. He felt good lots of days.\nTrouble was, on the bad days, that was hard to remember. At those times,\nfor some reason, he felt like he had always been in darkness, and always\nwould be."

At those times,\nfor some reason, he felt like he had always been in darkness, and always\nwould be.\nWhy was it so hard to remember? Did he have to keep slipping back\ndown? Why couldn’t he stay up here in the sunlight, where everyone else\nlived?\nIt was nearing evening, maybe two hours from sunset. They passed\nseveral plazas like the one where they’d tested his Surgebinding. Most had\nbeen turned into living space, with people crowding in. Just sitting and\nwaiting for whatever would happen next.\nKaladin trailed a little behind the others, and when Adolin noticed, he\nexcused himself from the conversation and dropped back. “Hey,” he said.\n“You all right?”\n“I’m worried that summoning a Shardblade would make me stand out\ntoo much,” Kaladin said. “I should have brought a spear tonight.”\n“Maybe you should let me teach you how to use a side sword. You’re\npretending to be head of our bodyguards tonight, and you’re lighteyed\ntoday. It looks strange for you to walk around without a side sword.”\n“Maybe I’m one of those punchy guys.”\nAdolin stopped in place and grinned at Kaladin. “Did you just say\n‘punchy guys’?”\n“You know, ardents who train to fight unarmed.”\n“Hand to hand?”\n“Hand to hand.”\n“Right,” Adolin said. “Or ‘punchy guys,’ as everyone calls them.”\nKaladin met his eyes, then found himself grinning back. “It’s the\nacademic term.”\n“Sure. Like swordy fellows. Or spearish chaps.”\n“I once knew a real axalacious bloke,” Kaladin said. “He was great at\npsychological fights.”\n“Psychological fights?”\n“He could really get inside someone’s head.”\nAdolin frowned as they walked. “Get inside … Oh!” Adolin chuckled,\nslapping Kaladin on the back. “You talk like a girl sometimes. Um … I\nmean that as a compliment.”\n“Thanks?”\n“But you do need to practice the sword more,” Adolin said, growing\nexcited. “I know you like the spear, and you’re good with it. Great! But\nyou’re not simply a spearman anymore; you’re going to be an irregular. You\nwon’t be fighting in a line, holding a shield for your buddies. Who knows\nwhat you’ll be facing?”\n“I trained a little with Zahel,” Kaladin said. “I’m not completely useless\nwith a sword. But … part of me doesn’t see the point.”\n“You’ll be better if you practice with a sword, trust me. Being a good\nduelist is about knowing one weapon, and being a good foot soldier—that’s\nprobably more about training than it is about any single weapon. But you\nwant to be a great warrior? For that you need to be able to use the best tool\nfor the job. Even if you’re never going to use a sword, you’ll fight people\nwho do. The best way to learn how to defeat someone wielding a weapon is\nto practice with it yourself.”\nKaladin nodded. He was right. It was strange to look at Adolin in that\nbright outfit, stylish and glittering with golden thread, and hear him speak\nreal battle sense."

It was strange to look at Adolin in that\nbright outfit, stylish and glittering with golden thread, and hear him speak\nreal battle sense.\nWhen I was imprisoned for daring to accuse Amaram, he was the only\nlighteyes who stood up for me.\nAdolin Kholin was simply a good person. Powder-blue clothing and all.\nYou couldn’t hate a man like him; storms, you kind of had to like him.\nTheir destination was a modest home, by lighteyed standard. Tall and\nnarrow, at four stories high it could have housed a dozen darkeyed families.\n“All right,” Elhokar said as they drew near. “Adolin and I will feel out\nthe lighteyes for potential allies. Bridgemen, chat with those in the darkeyed\nguard tent, and see if you can discover anything about the Cult of Moments,\nor other oddities in the city.”\n“Got it, Your Majesty,” Drehy said.\n“Captain,” he said to Kaladin, “you’ll go to the lighteyed guard tent. See\nif you can—”\n“—find out anything about this Highmarshal Azure person,” Kaladin\nsaid. “From the Wall Guard.”\n“Yes. We will plan to stay relatively late, as intoxicated party guests\nmight share more than sober ones.”\nThey broke, Adolin and Elhokar presenting invitations to the doorman,\nwho let them in—then gestured Drehy and Skar toward the darkeyed\nguards’ feast, happening in a tent set up on the grounds.\nThere was a separate tent for people who were lighteyed but not\nlandowners. Privileged, but not good enough to get in the doors to the\nactual party. In his role as a lighteyed bodyguard, that would be the place\nfor Kaladin—but for some reason the thought of going in there made him\nfeel sick.\nInstead he whispered to Skar and Drehy—promising to be back soon—\nand borrowed Skar’s spear, just in case. Then Kaladin left, walking the\nblock. He’d return to do as told by Elhokar. But while there was enough\nlight, he thought he’d maybe survey the wall and see if he could get an idea\nof the Wall Guard’s numbers.\nMore, he wanted to walk a little longer. He strolled to the foot of the\nnearby city wall, counting guard posts on top, looking at the large lower\nportion that was a natural part of the local rock. He rested his hand on the\nsmooth, strata-lined formation of stone.\n“Hey!” a voice called. “Hey, you!”\nKaladin sighed. A squad of soldiers from the Wall Guard was patrolling\nhere. They considered this road around the city—next to the foot of the wall\n—to be their jurisdiction, but they didn’t patrol any farther inward.\nWhat did they want? He wasn’t doing anything wrong. Well, running\nwould only stir up a ruckus, so he dropped his spear and turned around,\nextending his arms out to the sides. In a city full of refugees, certainly they\nwouldn’t harass one man too much.\nA squad of five tromped over to him, led by a man with a wispy dark\nbeard and bright, light blue eyes.

The man took in Kaladin’s uniform, with\nno insignia, and glanced at the fallen spear. Then he looked at Kaladin’s\nforehead and frowned.\nKaladin raised his hands to the brands there, which he could feel. But\nShallan had put an illusion over those. Hadn’t she?\nDamnation. He’s going to assume I’m a deserter.\n“Deserter, I assume?” the soldier asked sharply.\nShould have just gone to the storming party.\n“Look,” Kaladin said. “I don’t want trouble. I just—”\n“Do you want a meal?”\n“A … meal?”\n“Free food for deserters.”\nThat’s unexpected.\nReluctantly, he lifted the hair from his forehead, testing to see that the\nbrands were still visible. Mostly, the hair prevented one from seeing the\ndetails.\nThe soldiers started visibly. Yes, they could see the brands. Shallan’s\nillusion had worn off for some reason? Hopefully the other disguises fared\nbetter.\n“A lighteyes with a shash brand?” their lieutenant asked. “Storms,\nfriend. You’ve got to have some story.” He slapped Kaladin on the back and\npointed toward their barracks ahead. “I’d love to hear it. Free meal, no\nstrings. We won’t press you into service. I give my oath.”\nWell, he’d wanted information about the leader of the Wall Guard, hadn’t\nhe? What better place to get it than from these men?\nKaladin picked up his spear and let them lead him away.\n70. Highmarshal Azure\nSomething is happening to the Sibling. I agree this is true, but the\ndivision among the Knights Radiant is not to blame. Our perceived\nworthiness is a separate issue.\n—From drawer 1-1, third zircon\nThe Wall Guard’s barracks smelled like home to Kaladin. Not his father’s\nhouse—which smelled of antiseptic and the flowers his mother crushed to\nseason the air. His true home. Leather. Boiling stew. Crowded men. Weapon\noil.\nSpheres hung on the walls, white and blue. The place was big enough to\nhouse two platoons, a fact confirmed by the shoulder patches he saw. The\nlarge common room was filled with tables, and a few armorers worked in\nthe corner, sewing jerkins or uniforms. Others sharpened weapons, a\nrhythmic, calming sound. These were the noises and scents of an army well\nmaintained.\nThe stew didn’t smell anywhere near as good as Rock’s; Kaladin had\nbeen spoiled by the Horneater’s cooking. Still, when one of the men went to\nfetch him a bowl, he found himself smiling. He settled onto a long wooden\nbench, near a fidgety little ardent who was scribing glyphwards onto pieces\nof cloth for the men.\nKaladin instantly loved this place, and the state of the men spoke highly\nof Highmarshal Azure. He would likely be some middling officer who had\nbeen thrust into command during the chaos of the riots, which made him all\nthe more impressive. Azure had secured the wall, gotten the parshmen out\nof the city, and seen to the defense of Kholinar."

Azure had secured the wall, gotten the parshmen out\nof the city, and seen to the defense of Kholinar.\nSyl zipped around the rafters as soldiers called out questions about the\nnewcomer. The lieutenant who had found him—his name was Noromin, but\nhis men called him Noro—answered readily. Kaladin was a deserter. He had\na shash brand, an ugly one. You should see it. Sadeas’s mark. On a lighteyes\nno less.\nThe others in the barrack found this curious, but not worrisome. Some\neven cheered. Storms. Kaladin couldn’t imagine any force of Dalinar’s\nsoldiers being so welcoming of a deserter, let alone a dangerous one.\nConsidering that, Kaladin now picked out another undercurrent in the\nroom. Men sharpening weapons that had chips in them. Armorers repairing\ncuts in leather—cuts made by lances in battle. Conspicuously empty seats at\nmost of the tables, with cups set at them.\nThese men had suffered losses. Not huge ones yet. They could still\nlaugh. But storms, there was a tension to this room.\n“So,” Noro said. “Shash brand?”\nThe rest of the squad settled in, and a short man with hair on the backs of\nhis hands set a bowl of thick stew and flatbread in front of Kaladin.\nStandard fare, with steamed tallew and cubed meat. Soulcast, of course, and\nlacking flavor—but hearty and nutritious.\n“I had a squabble,” Kaladin said, “with Highlord Amaram. I felt he’d\ngotten some of my men killed needlessly. He disagreed.”\n“Amaram,” said one of the men. “You aim high, friend.”\n“I know Amaram,” the man with hairy hands said. “I did secret missions\nfor him, back in my operative days.”\nKaladin looked at him, surprised.\n“Best to ignore Beard,” Lieutenant Noro said. “It’s what the rest of us\ndo.”\n“Beard” didn’t have a beard. Maybe the hairy hands were enough. He\nnudged Kaladin. “It’s a good story. I’ll tell it to you sometime.”\n“You can’t just brand a lighteyed man a slave,” Lieutenant Noro said.\n“You need a highprince’s permission. There’s more to this story.”\n“There is,” Kaladin said. Then he continued eating his stew.\n“Oooh,” said a tall member of the squad. “Mystery!”\nNoro chuckled, then waved at the room. “So what do you think?”\n“You said you weren’t going to press me,” Kaladin said between bites.\n“I’m not pressing you, but you won’t find a place out there in the city\nwhere you’ll eat as well as you do here.”\n“Where do you get it?” Kaladin asked, spooning the stew into his mouth.\n“You can’t use Soulcasters. The screamers will come after you. Stockpile?\nI’m surprised one of the highlords in the city hasn’t tried to appropriate it.”\n“Astute,” Lieutenant Noro said with a smile. He had a disarming way\nabout him. “That’s a Guard secret. But in here there’s always a stew"

But in here there’s always a stew\nbubbling and bread baking.”\n“It’s my recipe,” Beard added.\n“Oh please,” the tall man said. “You’re a cook now too, Beard?”\n“A chef, thank you very much. I learned that flatbread recipe from a\nHorneater mystic at the top of a mountain. The real story is how I got\nthere.…”\n“It’s where you landed, obviously,” the tall soldier said, “after someone\nin your last squad kicked you.”\nThe men laughed. It felt warm in here, on this long bench, a well-laid\nfire burning steadily in the corner. Warm and friendly. As Kaladin ate, they\ngave him some space, chatting among themselves. Noro … he seemed less\na soldier and more a chummy merchant trying to sell you earrings for your\nbeloved. He dropped very obvious dangling hints for Kaladin. Reminders of\nhow well-fed they were, of how good it was to be part of a squad. He spoke\nof warm beds, of how they didn’t have to go on watch duty that often. Of\nplaying cards while the highstorm blew.\nKaladin got a second bowl of stew, and as he settled back into his place,\nhe realized something with a shock.\nStorms. They’re all lighteyes, aren’t they?\nEvery person in the room, from the cook to the armorers, to the soldiers\ndoing dishes. In a group like this, everyone had a secondary duty, like\narmoring or field surgery. Kaladin hadn’t noticed their eyes. The place had\nfelt so natural, so comfortable, that he’d assumed they were all darkeyed\nlike him.\nHe knew that most lighteyed soldiers weren’t high officers. He’d been\ntold that they were basically just people—he’d been told it over and over.\nSomehow, sitting in that room finally made the fact real to him.\n“So, Kal…” Lieutenant Noro asked. “What do you think? Maybe\nreenlist? Give this another try?”\n“Aren’t you afraid I’ll desert?” Kaladin asked. “Or worse, that I can’t\ncontrol my temper? I might be dangerous.”\n“Not as dangerous as being short manned,” Beard said. “You know how\nto kill people? That’s good enough for us.”\nKaladin nodded. “Tell me about your commander. That will be a big part\nof any group. I only just got into town. Who is this Highmarshal Azure?”\n“You can meet him yourself!” Beard said. “He does rounds every night\naround dinner time, checking on each barracks.”\n“Um, yes,” Noro said.\nKaladin eyed him. The lieutenant seemed uncomfortable.\n“The highmarshal,” Noro said quickly, “is incredible. We lost our former\ncommander during the riots, and Azure led a group who held the wall when\nthe Cult of Moments tried—in the chaos—to seize the city gates.”\n“He fought like a Voidbringer,” another squad member said. “I was\nthere. We were almost overwhelmed, then Azure joined us, holding aloft a\ngleaming Shardblade. He rallied our numbers, inspired even the wounded to\nkeep fighting. Storms. Felt like we had spren at our backs, holding us up,\nhelping us fight.”"

Felt like we had spren at our backs, holding us up,\nhelping us fight.”\nKaladin narrowed his eyes. “You don’t say…”\nHe pried more from them as he finished his bowl. They had nothing but\npraise for Azure, though the man hadn’t displayed any other … odd abilities\nthat Kaladin could discover. Azure was a Shardbearer, maybe a foreigner,\nwho had been previously unknown to the Guard—but with the fall of their\ncommander, and the subsequent disappearance of their highlord patron at\nthe palace, Azure had ended up in command.\nThere was something else. Something they weren’t saying. Kaladin\nhelped himself to a third bowl of stew, more to delay to see if the\nhighmarshal really would make an appearance or not.\nSoon, a disturbance near the door sent men standing up. Kaladin\nfollowed suit, turning. A senior officer entered wearing a glittering chain\nand a bright tabard, accompanied by attendants, inspiring a round of salutes.\nThe highmarshal wore an appropriately azure cloak—a lighter shade than\nthe traditional Kholin blue—with a mail coif down around the neck and a\nhelm carried in hand.\nShe was also a she.\nKaladin blinked in surprise, and heard a gasp from Syl up above. The\nhighmarshal was of average height for an Alethi woman, maybe just under,\nand wore her hair straight and short, reaching halfway down her cheeks.\nHer eyes were orange, and she wore a side sword with a glistening silver\nbasket hilt. That wasn’t Alethi design. Was it the aforementioned\nShardblade? It did have an otherworldly look about it, but why wear it\ninstead of dismissing it?\nRegardless, the highmarshal was lean and grim, and had a couple of\nserious scars on her face. She wore gloves on both hands.\n“The highmarshal is a woman?” Kaladin hissed.\n“We don’t talk about the marshal’s secret,” Beard said.\n“Secret?” Kaladin said. “It’s pretty storming obvious.”\n“We don’t talk about the marshal’s secret,” Beard repeated, and the\nothers nodded. “Hush, all right?”\nHush about it? Storms. This sort of thing simply didn’t happen in Vorin\nsociety. Not like in the ballads and stories. He’d been in three armies, and\nhad never seen a woman holding a weapon. Even the Alethi scouts carried\nonly knives. He’d half expected a riot when he’d armed Lyn and the others,\nalthough for Radiants, Jasnah and Shallan had already supplied precedent.\nAzure told the men they could sit down. One of the men offered her a\nbowl of stew, and she accepted. The men cheered after she took a bite and\ncomplimented the cook.\nShe handed the bowl to one of her attendants, and things returned to\nnormal—men chatting, working, eating. Azure walked to speak with the\nvarious officers. First the platoon leader, who would be a captain. The other\nlieutenants next.\nWhen she stopped at their table, she took in Kaladin with a discerning\ngaze.\n“Who’s the new recruit, Lieutenant Noro?” she asked.\n“This is Kal, sir!” Noro said. “Found him haunting the street outside."

It’s the one I\ndidn’t kill.”\n“That has the sound of a practiced explanation, soldier.”\n“That’s because it is.”\nKaladin figured she, at last, would push for more information. She\nmerely grunted. He couldn’t place her age, though the scars probably made\nher look older than she really was.\n“You joining up?” she said. “We have food for you.”\n“Frankly, sir, I don’t know. On one hand, I can’t believe nobody cares\nabout my past. On the other, you’re obviously desperate, which also makes\nme reluctant.”\nShe turned toward Lieutenant Noro. “You haven’t shown him?”\n“No, sir. We just got some stew in him.”\n“I’ll do it. Kal, come with me.”\n* * *\nWhatever they wanted to show him was at the top of the wall, as they hiked\nhim up an enclosed stone stairwell. Kaladin wanted to learn more about the\nsupposed “secret” that Azure was a woman. But when he asked, Lieutenant\nNoro shook his head quickly and made a hushing motion.\nSoon they’d assembled atop the fortifications. The Kholinar wall was a\npowerful defensive structure, reportedly over sixty feet tall at points, with a\nwide wall walk on the top, ten feet across. The wall rolled across the\nlandscape, enclosing all of Kholinar. It had actually been built on top of the\nouter windblades, fitting onto them like an inverted crown, the raised\nportions matching crevasses between windblades.\nThe wall was interrupted by guard towers every three hundred feet or so.\nThese large structures were big enough to house squads, perhaps entire\nplatoons, on watch.\n“Guessing from that brand,” Azure said to him, “you were in one of the\narmies that recruits in the north. You joined up to fight on the Shattered\nPlains, didn’t you? But Sadeas used that army up north to funnel him\nveterans, plus maybe seize some land now and then from rival highprinces.\nYou ended up fighting other Alethi, scared farmboys, instead of shipping off\nto avenge the king. Something like that?”\n“Something like that,” Kaladin admitted.\n“Damnation me if I blame a man for deserting that,” Azure said. “I don’t\nhold it against you, soldier.”\n“And the brand?”\nAzure pointed northward. Night had finally fallen, and in the distance,\nKaladin could see a glow.\n“They advance back into place after each storm,” Azure said softly. “And\ncamp a portion of their army out there. That’s good battle sense, to prevent\nus from being resupplied—and to make sure we don’t know when they’ll\nattack. Nightmares, Kal. A real Voidbringer army.\n“If that were an Alethi force, the people in this city wouldn’t have much\nto worry about. Sure, there would be casualties on the wall, but no would-be"

At best, they’ll enslave the entire populace. At\nworst…” She let the thought dangle, then looked at him. “I’m glad you\nhave a brand. It says you’re dangerous, and we have narrow confines up\nhere on the wall. We can’t simply press every eligible man; I need real\nsoldiers, men who know what they’re doing.”\n“So that’s why I’m here?” Kaladin asked. “To see that?”\n“I want you to think,” Azure said. “I tell the men—this Wall Guard, this\nis redemption. If you fight here, nobody will care what you did before.\nBecause they know if we fall, this city and this nation will be no more.\n“Nothing matters, except holding this wall when that assault comes. You\ncan go hide in the city and pray that we are strong enough without you. But\nif we aren’t, you’ll be no more than another corpse. Up here, you can fight.\nUp here, you have a chance.\n“We won’t press you. Walk away tonight.

Then when you come back tomorrow, we’ll get you a Wall Guard\npatch.”\nIt was a potent speech. Kaladin glanced to Syl, who landed on his\nshoulder, then took a long look at the lights on the horizon.\nAre you out there, Sah? Did they bring you and the others here? What of\nSah’s little daughter, who had collected flowers and clutched playing cards\nlike a treasured toy? Was Khen there, the parshwoman who had demanded\nKaladin retain his freedom, despite being angry at him for the entire trip?\nWinds send that they hadn’t been dragged further into this mess.\nHe joined the others in clattering back down the stairwell. Afterward,\nNoro and the rest of the squad bade him a happy farewell, as if certain he’d\nreturn. And he probably would, though not for the reasons they assumed.\nHe went back to the mansion and forced himself to chat with some of the\nguards at the lighteyed tent, though he learned nothing, and his brands made\nsomething of a stir among them. Adolin and Elhokar finally emerged, their\nillusions intact. So what was wrong with Kaladin’s? The sphere Shallan had\ngiven him was still infused.\nKaladin gathered Drehy and Skar, then joined the king and Adolin as\nthey started the walk home.\n“What has you so thoughtful, Captain?” Elhokar asked.\n“I think,” Kaladin said, eyes narrowed, “I might have found us another\nRadiant.”\n71.

They converged toward the Rift.\nDalinar spent much of the trip passing through pungent smoke trails\nfrom the incense Evi burned in a small censer attached to the side of her\ncarriage. A petition to the Heralds to bless her marriage.\nHe often heard her weeping inside the vehicle, though whenever she left\nit she was perfectly composed. She read letters, scribed his responses, and\ntook notes at his meetings with generals. In every way, she was the perfect\nAlethi wife—and her unhappiness crushed his soul.\nEventually they reached the plains around the lake, crossing the riverbed\n—which was dry, except during storms. The rockbuds drank so fully of the\nlocal water supply, they’d grown to enormous sizes. Some were taller than a\nman’s waist, and the vines they produced were as thick as Dalinar’s wrist.\nHe rode alongside the carriage—his horse’s hooves beating a familiar\nrhythm on the stones beneath—and smelled incense. Evi’s hand reached out\nof her carriage’s side window, and she placed another glyphward into the\ncenser. He didn’t see her face, and her hand retreated quickly.\nStorming woman. An Alethi would be using this as a ploy to guilt him\ninto bending. But she wasn’t Alethi, for all her earnest imitations. Evi was\nfar too genuine, and her tears were real. She sincerely thought their spat\nback in the Veden fortress boded ill for their relationship.\nThat bothered him. More than he wanted to admit.\nA young scout jogged up to give him the latest report: The vanguard had\nsecured his desired camp ground near the city. There had been no fighting\nyet, and he hadn’t expected any. Tanalan would not abandon the walls\naround the Rift to try to control ground beyond bowshot.\nIt was good news, but Dalinar still wanted to snap at the messenger—he\nwanted to snap at someone. Stormfather, this battle couldn’t come soon\nenough. He restrained himself and sent the messenger woman away with a\nword of thanks.\nWhy did he care so much about Evi’s petulance? He’d never let his\narguments with Gavilar bother him. Storms, he’d never let his arguments\nwith Evi bother him this way before. It was strange. He could have the\naccolades of men, fame that stretched across a continent, but if she didn’t\nadmire him, he felt that he had somehow failed. Could he really ride into\ncombat feeling like this?\nNo. He couldn’t.\nThen do something about it. As they wound through the plain of\nrockbuds, he called to the driver of Evi’s carriage, having him stop. Then,\nhanding his horse’s reins to an attendant, he climbed into the carriage.\nEvi bit her lip as he settled down on the seat across from her. It smelled\nnice within—the incense was fainter here, while the crem dust of the road\nwas blocked by wood and cloth. The cushions were plush, and she had\nsome dried fruit in a dish, even some chilled water.\n“What is wrong?” she demanded.\n“I was feeling saddle sore.”\nShe cocked her head. “Perhaps you could request a salve—”"

In here, she had undone\nand rolled back her safehand sleeve, displaying her long, elegant fingers.\n“Isn’t this what you wanted?” Dalinar said, looking away from the\nsafehand. “You’ve been praying nonstop.”\n“For the Heralds to soften your heart.”\n“Right. Well, they’ve done that. Here I am. Let’s talk.”\n“No, Dalinar,” she said, reaching across to fondly touch his knee. “I\nwasn’t praying for myself, but for those of your countrymen you are\nplanning to kill.”\n“The rebels?”\n“Men no different from you, who happened to be born in another city.\nWhat would you have done, had an army come to conquer your home?”\n“I’d have fought,” Dalinar said. “As they will. The better men will\ndominate.”\n“What gives you the right?”\n“My sword.” Dalinar shrugged. “If the Almighty wants us to rule, we’ll\nwin. If He doesn’t, then we’ll lose. I rather think He wants to see which of\nus is stronger.”\n“And is there no room for mercy?”\n“Mercy landed us here in the first place. If they don’t want to fight, they\nshould give in to our rule.”\n“But—” She looked down, hands in her lap. “I’m sorry. I don’t want\nanother argument.”\n“I do,” Dalinar said. “I like it when you stand up for yourself. I like it\nwhen you fight.”\nShe blinked tears and looked away.\n“Evi…” Dalinar said.\n“I hate what this does to you,” she said softly. “I see beauty in you,\nDalinar Kholin. I see a great man struggling against a terrible one. And\nsometimes, you get this look in your eyes. A horrible, terrifying\nnothingness. Like you have become a creature with no heart, feasting upon\nsouls to fill that void, dragging painspren in your wake. It haunts me,\nDalinar.”\nDalinar shifted on the carriage seat. What did that even mean? A “look”\nin his eyes? Was this like when she’d claimed that people stored bad\nmemories in their skin, and needed to rub them off with a stone once a\nmonth? Westerners had some curiously superstitious beliefs.\n“What would you have me do, Evi?” he asked softly.\n“Have I won again?” she said, sounding bitter. “Another battle where\nI’ve bloodied you?”\n“I just … I need to know what you want. So I can understand.”\n“Don’t kill today. Hold back the monster.”\n“And the rebels? Their brightlord?”\n“You spared that boy’s life once before.”\n“An obvious mistake.”\n“A sign of humanity, Dalinar. You asked what I want. It is foolish, and I\ncan see there is trouble here, that you have a duty. But … I do not wish to\nsee you kill. Do not feed it.”\nHe rested his hand on hers.

Eventually the carriage slowed again, and\nDalinar stepped out to survey an open area not clogged by rockbuds. The\nvanguard waited there, five thousand strong, assembled in perfect ranks.\nTeleb did like to put on a good show.\nAcross the field, outside of bowshot, a wall broke the landscape with—\nseemingly—nothing to protect. The city was hidden in the rift in the stone.\nFrom the southwest, a breeze off the lake brought the fecund scent of weeds\nand crem.\nTeleb strode up, wearing his Plate. Well, Adolin’s Plate.\nEvi’s Plate.\n“Brightlord,” Teleb said, “a short time ago, a large guarded caravan left\nthe Rift. We hadn’t the men to besiege the city, and you had ordered us not\nto engage. So I sent a scout team to tail them, men who know the area, but\notherwise let the caravan escape.”\n“You did well,” Dalinar said, taking his horse from a groom. “Though\nI’d have liked to know who was bringing supplies to the Rift, that might\nhave been an attempt to draw you away into a skirmish. However, gather\nthe vanguard now and bring them in behind me. Pass the word to the rest of\nthe men. Have them form ranks, just in case.”\n“Sir?” Teleb asked, shocked. “You don’t want to rest the army before\nattacking?”\nDalinar swung into the saddle and rode past him at a trot, heading toward\nthe Rift. Teleb—usually so unflappable—cursed and shouted orders, then\nhurried to the vanguard, gathering them and marching them hastily behind\nDalinar.\nDalinar made sure not to get too far ahead. Soon he approached the walls\nof Rathalas, where the rebels had gathered, primarily archers. They\nwouldn’t be expecting an attack so soon, but of course Dalinar wouldn’t\ncamp for long outside either, not exposed to the storms.\nDo not feed it.\nDid she know that he considered this hunger inside of him, the bloodlust,\nto be something strangely external? A companion. Many of his officers felt\nthe same. It was natural. You went to war, and the Thrill was your reward.\nDalinar’s armorers arrived, and he climbed out of the saddle and stepped\ninto the boots they provided, then held out his arms, letting them quickly\nstrap on his breastplate and other sections of armor.\n“Wait here,” he told his men, then climbed back onto his horse and set\nhis helm on his pommel. He walked his horse out onto the killing field,\nsummoning his Shardblade and resting it on his shoulder, reins in the other\nhand.\nYears had passed since his last assault on the Rift. He imagined Gavilar\nracing ahead of him, Sadeas cursing from behind them and demanding\n“prudence.” Dalinar picked his way forward until he was about halfway to\nthe gates. Any closer and those archers were likely to start shooting; he was\nalready well within their range. He stilled his horse and waited.\nThere was some discussion on the walls; he could see the agitation\namong the soldiers. After about thirty minutes of him sitting there, his horse"

After about thirty minutes of him sitting there, his horse\ncalmly licking the ground and nibbling at the grass that peeked out, the\ngates finally creaked open. A company of infantrymen poured out,\naccompanying two men on horseback. Dalinar dismissed the bald one with\nthe purple birthmark across half his face; he was too old to be the boy\nDalinar had spared.\nIt had to be the younger man riding the white steed, cape streaming\nbehind him. Yes, he had an eagerness to him, his horse threatening to\noutstrip his guards. And the way he stared daggers at Dalinar … this was\nBrightlord Tanalan, son of the old Tanalan, whom Dalinar had bested after\nfalling down into the Rift itself. That furious fight across wooden bridges\nand then in a garden suspended from the side of the chasm.\nThe group stopped about fifty feet from Dalinar.\n“Have you come to parley?” called the man with the birthmark on his\nface.\nDalinar walked his horse closer so he wouldn’t have to shout. Tanalan’s\nguards raised shields and spears.\nDalinar inspected them, then the fortifications. “You’ve done well here.\nPolemen on the walls to push me off, should I come in alone. Netting\ndraped down at the top, which you can cut free to entangle me.”\n“What do you want, tyrant?” Tanalan snapped. His voice had the typical\nnasal accent of the Rifters.\nDalinar dismissed his Blade and swung free of his horse, Plate grinding\non stone as he hit the ground. “Walk with me a moment, Brightlord. I\npromise not to harm you unless I’m attacked first.”\n“I’m supposed to take your word?”\n“What did I do, the last time we were together?” Dalinar asked. “When I\nhad you in my hand, how did I act?”\n“You robbed me.”\n“And?” Dalinar asked, meeting the younger man’s violet eyes.\nTanalan measured him, tapping one finger against his saddle. Finally he\ndismounted. The man with the birthmark put a hand on his shoulder, but the\nyouthful brightlord pulled free.\n“I don’t see what you hope to accomplish here, Blackthorn,” Tanalan\nsaid, joining Dalinar. “We have nothing to say to one another.”\n“What do I want to accomplish?” Dalinar said, musing. “I’m not certain.\nMy brother is normally the talker.” He started walking along the corridor\nbetween the two hostile armies. Tanalan lingered, then jogged to catch up.\n“Your troops look good,” Dalinar said. “Brave. Arrayed against a\nstronger force, yet determined.”\n“They have strong motivation, Blackthorn. You murdered many of their\nfathers.”\n“It will be a pity to destroy them in turn.”\n“Assuming you can.”\nDalinar stopped and turned to regard the shorter man. They stood on a\ntoo-quiet field, where even the rockbuds and the grass had the sense to\nwithdraw. “Have I ever lost a battle, Tanalan?” Dalinar asked softly. “You\nknow my reputation. Do you think it exaggerated?”"

Do you think it exaggerated?”\nThe younger man shifted, looking over his shoulder toward where he had\nleft his guards and advisors. When he looked back, he was more resolved.\n“Better to die trying to bring you down than to surrender.”\n“You’d better be sure of that,” Dalinar said. “Because if I win here, I’m\ngoing to have to make an example. I’ll break you, Tanalan. Your sorry,\nweeping city will be held up before all who would defy my brother. Be\nabsolutely certain you want to fight me, because once this starts, I will be\nforced to leave only widows and corpses to populate the Rift.”\nThe young nobleman’s jaw slowly dropped. “I…”\n“My brother attempted words and politics to bring you into line,”\nDalinar said. “Well, I’m good at only one thing. He builds. I destroy. But\nbecause of the tears of a good woman, I have come—against my better\njudgment—to offer you an alternative. Let’s find an accommodation that\nwill spare your city.”\n“An accommodation? You killed my father.”\n“And someday a man will kill me,” Dalinar said. “My sons will curse his\nname as you curse mine. I hope they don’t throw away thousands of lives in\na hopeless battle because of that grudge. You want vengeance. Fine. Let’s\nduel. Me and you. I’ll lend you a Blade and Plate, and we’ll face each other\non equal grounds. I win, and your people surrender.”\n“And if I beat you, will your armies leave?”\n“Hardly,” Dalinar said. “I suspect they’ll fight harder. But they won’t\nhave me, and you’ll have won your father’s Blade back. Who knows?\nMaybe you’ll defeat the army. You’ll have a better storming chance, at\nleast.”\nTanalan frowned at Dalinar. “You aren’t the man I thought you were.”\n“I’m the same man I’ve always been. But today … today that man\ndoesn’t want to kill anyone.”\nA sudden fire inside him raged against those words. Was he really going\nto such lengths to avoid the conflict he’d been so anticipating?\n“One of your own is working against you,” Tanalan suddenly said. “The\nloyal highprinces? There’s a traitor among them.”\n“I’d be surprised if there weren’t several,” Dalinar said. “But yes, we\nknow that one has been working with you.”\n“A pity,” Tanalan said. “His men were here not an hour ago. A little\nearlier and you’d have caught them. Maybe they’d have been forced to join\nme, and their master would have been pulled into the war.” He shook his\nhead, then turned and walked back toward his advisors.\nDalinar sighed in frustration. A dismissal. Well, there had never been\nmuch of a chance that this would work. He walked back to his horse and\npulled himself up into the saddle.\nTanalan mounted as well. Before riding back to his city, the man gave\nDalinar a salute. “This is unfortunate,” he said. “But I see no other way. I\ncannot defeat you in a duel, Blackthorn. To try would be foolish. But your\noffer is … appreciated.”"

But your\noffer is … appreciated.”\nDalinar grunted, pulled on his helm, then turned his horse.\n“Unless…” Tanalan said.\n“Unless?”\n“Unless, of course, this was really a ruse all along, a scheme arranged by\nyour brother, you, and me,” Tanalan said. “A … false rebellion. Intended to\ntrick disloyal highprinces into revealing themselves.”\nDalinar raised his faceplate and turned back.\n“Perhaps my outrage was feigned,” Tanalan said. “Perhaps we have been\nin touch since your attack here, all those years ago. You did spare my life,\nafter all.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, feeling a sudden surge of excitement. “That would\nexplain why Gavilar didn’t immediately send our armies against you. We\nwere in collusion all along.”\n“What better proof, than the fact that we just had this strange battlefield\nconversation?” Tanalan looked over his shoulder at the body of his men on\nthe wall. “My men must be thinking it very odd. It will make sense when\nthey hear the truth—that I was telling you about the envoy that had been\nhere, delivering weapons and supplies to us from one of your secret\nenemies.”\n“Your reward, of course,” Dalinar said, “would be legitimacy as a\nhighlord in the kingdom. Perhaps that highprince’s place.”\n“And no fighting today,” Tanalan said. “No deaths.”\n“No deaths. Except perhaps for the actual traitors.”\nTanalan looked to his advisors. The man with the birthmark nodded\nslowly.\n“They headed east, toward the Unclaimed Hills,” Tanalan said, pointing.\n“A hundred soldiers and caravaneers. I think they were planning to stay for\nthe night in the waystop at a town called Vedelliar.”\n“Who was it?” Dalinar asked. “Which highprince?”\n“It might be best if you find out for yourself, as—”\n“Who?” Dalinar demanded.\n“Brightlord Torol Sadeas.”\nSadeas? “Impossible!”\n“As I said,” Tanalan noted. “Best if you see for yourself. But I will\ntestify before the king, assuming you keep your side of our … accord.”\n“Open your gates to my men,” Dalinar said, pointing. “Stand down your\nsoldiers. You have my word of honor for your safety.”\nWith that, he turned and trotted back toward his forces, passing into a\ncorridor of men. As he did, Teleb ran up to meet him. “Brightlord!” he said.\n“My scouts have returned from surveying that caravan. Sir, it—”\n“Was from a highprince?”\n“Undoubtedly,” Teleb said. “They couldn’t determine which one, but\nthey claim to have seen someone in Shardplate among them.”\nShardplate? That made no sense.\nUnless that is how he’s planning to see that we lose, Dalinar thought.\nThat might not have been a simple supply caravan—it could be a flanking\nforce in disguise.\nA single Shardbearer hitting the back of his army while it was distracted\ncould do incredible damage. Dalinar didn’t believe Tanalan, not completely."

Dalinar didn’t believe Tanalan, not completely.\nBut … storms, if Sadeas secretly had sent one of his Shardbearers to the\nbattlefield, Dalinar couldn’t just send a simple team of soldiers to deal with\nhim.\n“You have command,” he said to Teleb. “Tanalan is going to stand down;\nhave the vanguard join the locals on the fortifications, but do not displace\nthem. Camp the rest of the army back in the field, and keep our officers out\nof Rathalas. This isn’t a surrender.

Runners dashed with messages, and\nthe entire area became a hive of motion, men and women hastening in all\ndirections.\nOne person stood still in the midst of it, hands clasped hopefully at her\nbreast. “What happened?” Evi asked as he trotted his horse toward her.\n“Go back to our camp and compose a message to my brother saying that\nwe may have brought the Rift to our side without bloodshed.” He paused,\nthen added, “Tell him not to trust anyone.

If stone\nmet a man, stone might win—but if stone met humanity, then no force could\npreserve it.\nThe city’s heartbeat was deep within these stones, old and slow. It had\nyet to realize something dark had moved in. A spren as ancient as it was. An\nurban disease. People didn’t speak of it; they avoided the palace, mentioned\nthe queen only to complain about the ardent who had been killed. It was\nlike standing in a highstorm and griping that your shoes were too tight.\nA soft whistling drew Veil’s attention. She looked up and scanned the\nsmall loading dock around her, occupied only by herself, Vathah, and their\nwagon. “Let’s go.”\nVeil eased the door open and entered the mansion proper. She and Vathah\nwore new faces. Hers was a version of Veil with too large a nose and\ndimpled cheeks.\nHis was the face of a brutish man Shallan had seen in the market.

The atrium went up four stories, with walkways around each\nlevel. Red was on the second, whistling as he leaned on the balustrade.\nThe real showpiece of the mansion, however, wasn’t the garden, but\nwaterfalls. Because not a single one of them was actually water.\nThey had been, once. But sometime long ago, someone had mixed far\ntoo much wealth with far too much imagination. They had hired Soulcasters\nto transform large fountains of water that had been poured from the top\nlevel, four stories up. They’d been Soulcast into other materials right as the\nwater splashed to the floor.\nVeil’s path took her along rooms to her left, with an overhang of the first\nfloor’s atrium balcony overhead. A former waterfall spilled down to her\nright, now made of crystal. The shape of flowing water crashed forever onto\nthe stone floor, where it blossomed outward in a wave, brilliant and\nglistening. The mansion had changed hands dozens of times, and people\ncalled it Rockfall—despite the newest owner’s attempt over the last decade\nto rename it the incredibly boring Hadinal Keep.\nVeil and Vathah hurried along, accompanied by Red’s reassuring\nwhistling. The next waterfall was similar in shape, but made instead from\npolished dark stumpweight wood. It looked strangely natural, almost like a\ntree could have grown in that shape, poured from above and running down\nin an undulating column, splashing outward at the base.\nThey soon passed a room to their left, where Ishnah was talking with the\ncurrent mistress of Rockfall. Each time the Everstorm struck, it left\ndestruction—but in an oddly distinct way from a highstorm. Everstorm\nlightning had proven its greatest danger. The strange red lightning didn’t\nmerely set fires or scorch the ground; it could break through rock, causing\nblasts of fragmenting stone.\nOne such strike had broken a gaping hole in the side of this ancient,\ncelebrated mansion. It had been patched with an unsightly wooden wall that\nwould be covered with crem, then finally bricked over. Brightness Nananav\n—a middle-aged Alethi woman with a bun of hair practically as tall as she\nwas—gestured at the boarded-up hole, and then at the floor.\n“You’ll make them match the others,” Nananav said to Ishnah, who wore\nthe guise of a rug merchant. “I won’t stand for them to be even a shade off.\nWhen you return with the repaired rugs, I’m going to set them beside the\nones in other rooms to check!”\n“Yes, Brightness,” Ishnah said. “But the damage is much worse than I\n—”\n“These rugs were woven in Shinovar. They were made by a blind man\nwho trained thirty years with a master weaver before being allowed to\nproduce his own rugs! He died after finishing my commission, so there are\nno others like these.”\n“I’m well aware, as you’ve told me three times now.…”\nVeil took a Memory of the woman; then she and Vathah slipped past the"

They were supposedly part of Ishnah’s\nstaff, and wouldn’t be suffered to wander about freely. Red—noting that\nthey were on their way—started to head back to rejoin Ishnah. He’d have\nbeen excused to visit the privy, but would be missed if he was gone too\nlong.\nHis tune cut off.\nVeil opened a door and pulled Vathah inside, heart thrumming as—right\noutside—a pair of guards walked down the stairwell from the second level.\n“I still say we should be doing this at night,” Vathah whispered.\n“They have this place guarded like a fort at night.”\nThe change of the guard was in midmorning, so Veil and the others had\ncome just before that. Theoretically, this meant the guards would be tired\nand bored after an uneventful night.\nVeil and Vathah had entered a small library lit by a few spheres in a\ngoblet on the table. Vathah eyed them, but didn’t move—this infiltration\nwas about far more than a few chips. Veil set down her pack and rummaged\nuntil she got out a notebook and charcoal pencil.\nVeil took a deep breath, then let Shallan bleed back into existence. She\nquickly sketched Nananav from the glimpse earlier.\n“I’m still amazed you were both of them, all along,” Vathah said. “You\ndon’t act anything like one another.”\n“That’s rather the point, Vathah.”\n“I wish I’d picked it out myself.” He grunted, scratching the side of his\nhead. “I like Veil.”\n“Not me?”\n“You’re my boss. I’m not supposed to like you.”\nStraightforward, if rude. At least you always knew where you stood with\nhim. He listened at the door, then cracked it open, tracking the guards. “All\nright. We go up the stairs, then come back along the second-floor walkway.\nWe grab the goods, stuff them in the dumbwaiter, and make for the exit.\nStorms. I wish we could do this when nobody was awake.”\n“What would be the fun of that?” Shallan finished her drawing with a\nflourish, then stood, poking Vathah in the side. “Admit it. You’re enjoying\nthis.”\n“I’m as nervous as a new recruit on his first day at war,” Vathah said.\n“My hands shake, and I swear every noise means someone spotted us. I feel\nsick.”\n“See?” Shallan said. “Fun.” She pushed beside him and glanced out\nthrough the cracked door. Storming guards. They’d set up in the atrium\nnearby. They could undoubtedly hear the real Nananav’s voice from there,\nso if Shallan strolled out wearing the woman’s face, that would certainly\ncause alarm.\nTime to get creative. Pattern buzzed as she considered. Make the\nwaterfalls flow again? Illusions of strange spren? No … no, nothing so\ntheatrical. Shallan was letting her sense of the dramatic run away with her.\nStay simple, as she’d done before. Veil’s way. She closed her eyes and"

She closed her eyes and\nbreathed out, pressing the Light into Pattern, Lightweaving only sound—\nthat of Nananav calling the guards into the room where she was lecturing\nIshnah. Why come up with a new trick when the old ones worked fine? Veil\ndidn’t feel the need to improvise merely to be different.\nPattern carried the illusion away, and the sound lured the guards off\ndown the hall. Shallan led Vathah out of the library, then around the corner\nand up the steps. She breathed out Stormlight, which washed over her, and\nbecame Veil fully. Then Veil became the woman who was not quite Veil,\nwith the dimples. And then, layered on top of that, she became Nananav.\nArrogant. Talkative. Certain that everyone around her was just looking\nfor a reason not to do things properly. As they stepped onto the next floor,\nshe adopted a calm, measured gait, eyeing the banister. When had that last\nbeen polished?\n“I don’t find this fun,” Vathah said, walking beside her. “But I do like it.”\n“Then it’s fun.”\n“Fun is winning at cards. This is something else.”\nHe’d taken to his role earnestly, but she really should look at getting\nmore refined servants. Vathah was like a hog in human clothing, always\ngrunting and mulling about.\nWhy shouldn’t she be served by the best? She was a Knight Radiant. She\nshouldn’t have to put up with barely human deserters who looked like\nsomething Shallan would draw after a hard night drinking, and maybe while\nholding the pencil with her teeth.\nThe role is getting to you, a part of her whispered. Careful. She glanced\nabout for Pattern, but he was still below.\nThey stopped at a second-floor room, locked tightly. The plan was for\nPattern to open it, but she didn’t have the patience to wait. Besides, a\nmaster-servant was walking along.\nHe gave a bow when he saw Nananav.\n“That is your bow?” Nananav said. “That quick bob? Where did they\nteach you that?”\n“My apologies, Brightness,” the man said, bowing more deeply.\n“I could cut your legs off at the knees,” Nananav said. “Then maybe\nyou’d at least appear properly penitent.” She rapped on the door. “Open\nthis.”\n“Why—” He broke off, perhaps realizing she was not in a mood for\ncomplaints. He hurried forward and undid the combination lock on the door,\nthen pulled it open for her, letting out air that smelled of spice.\n“You may go do penance for your insult to me,” Nananav said. “Climb\nto the roof and sit there for exactly one hour.”\n“Brightness, if I have offended—”\n“If?” She pointed. “Go!”\nHe gave another bow—barely sufficient—and ran off.\n“You might be overdoing that, Brightness,” Vathah said, rubbing his\nchin. “She has a reputation for being difficult, not insane.”\n“Shut up,” Nananav said, striding into the room.\nThe mansion’s larder."

Sacks of grain were stacked in\nthe back, and boxes filled with longroots and other tubers covered the floor.\nBags of spices. Small jugs of oil.\nVathah pulled the door closed, then hurriedly began stuffing sausages in\na sack. Nananav wasn’t so hasty. This was a good place to keep it all, nice\nand locked up. Taking it elsewhere seemed … well, a crime.\nMaybe she could move into Rockfall, act the part. And the former lady\nof the house? Well, she was an inferior version, obviously. Just deal with\nher, take her place. It would feel right, wouldn’t it?\nWith a chill, Veil let one layer of illusion drop. Storms … Storms. What\nhad that been?\n“Not to give offense, Brightness,” Vathah said, putting his sack of\nsausages in the dumbwaiter, “but you can stand there and supervise. Or you\ncan storming help, and get twice as much food along with half as much\nego.”\n“Sorry,” Veil said, grabbing a sack of grain. “That woman’s head is a\nfrightening place.”\n“Well, I did say that Nananav is notoriously difficult.”\nYeah, Veil thought. But I was talking about Shallan.\nThey worked quickly, filling the large dumbwaiter—which was needed\nto take in large shipments from the delivery room below. They got all of the\nsausages, most of the longroots, and a few sacks of grain. Once the\ndumbwaiter was full, the two of them lowered the thing to the ground floor.\nThey waited by the door, and fortunately Red started whistling. The ground\nfloor was clear again. Not trusting herself with Nananav’s face, she stayed\nVeil as the two hurried out. Pattern waited outside, and he hummed,\nclimbing her trousers.\nOn their way down, they passed a waterfall made of pure marble.\nShallan would have loved to linger and marvel at the artful Soulcasting.\nFortunately, Veil was running this operation. Shallan … Shallan got lost in\nthings. She’d get focused on details, or stick her head in the clouds and\ndream about the big picture. That comfortable middle, that safe place of\nmoderation, was unfamiliar ground to her.\nThey descended the steps, then joined Red at the damaged room and\nhelped him carry a rolled-up carpet to the loading bay. She had Pattern\nquietly open the lock to the dumbwaiter down here, then sent him away to\ndecoy a few servants who had been bringing wood into the bay. They\npursued an image of a feral mink with a key in its mouth.\nTogether, Veil, Red, and Vathah unrolled the rug, filled it with sacks of\nfood from the dumbwaiter, then rolled it back up and heaved it into their\nwaiting wagon.

She cocked her head at the strange sight of pools of liquid,\ndripping down.\nAngerspren, she realized. Collecting there and then boiling through the\nfloor. The larder was directly above them.\n“Run!” Veil said, spinning and bolting back toward the wagon. A second\nlater, someone upstairs started shouting.\nVeil scrambled into the wagon’s seat, then slapped the chull with the\nsteering reed. Her team, joined by Ishnah, charged back into the room and\nleapt into the wagon, which started moving. Step. By. Protracted. Step.\nVeil … Shallan slapped the large crab on the shell, urging it forward. But\nchulls went at chull speed. The wagon eased out into the courtyard, and\nahead the gates were already closing.\n“Storms!” Vathah said. He looked over his shoulder. “Is this part of the\n‘fun’?”\nBehind them, Nananav burst out of the building, her hair wobbling.\n“Stop them! Thieves!”\n“Shallan?” Vathah asked. “Veil? Whoever you are? Storms, they have\ncrossbows!”\nShallan breathed out.\nThe gates clanged shut ahead of them. Armed guards entered the small\ncourtyard, weapons ready.\n“Shallan!” Vathah cried.\nShe stood on the wagon, Stormlight swirling around her. The chull\npulled to a stop, and she confronted the guards. The men stumbled to a halt,\njaws dropping.\nBehind, Nananav broke the silence. “What are you idiots doing?\nWhy…”\nShe trailed off, then pulled up short as Shallan turned to look at her.\nWearing the woman’s face.\nSame hair. Same features. Same clothing. Mimicked right down to the\nattitude, with nose in the air. Shallan/Nananav raised her hands to the side,\nand spren burst from the ground around the wagon. Pools of blood,\nshimmering the wrong color, and boiling far too violently. Pieces of glass\nthat rained down. Anticipationspren, like thin tentacles.\nShallan/Nananav let her image distort, features sliding off her face,\ndripping down like paint running down a wall. Ordinary Nananav screamed\nand fled back toward the building. One of the guards loosed his crossbow,\nand the bolt took Shallan/Nananav right in the head.\nBother.\nHer vision went dark for a moment, and she had a flash of panic\nremembering her stabbing in the palace. But why should she care if actual\npainspren joined the illusory ones around her? She righted herself and\nlooked back toward the soldiers, her face melting, the crossbow bolt\nsticking from her temple.\nThe guards ran.\n“Vathah,” she said, “plesh open sha gate.” Her mouth didn’t work right.\nHow odd.\nVathah didn’t move, so she glared at him.\n“Gah!” he shouted, scrambling back and stumbling across one of the\nrugs in the bed of the wagon.

Just normal,\neveryday Veil. “Itsh all right,” Veil said. “Jush illushionsh. Go, open sha\ngatesh.”\nVathah heaved himself out of the wagon and ran for the gates.\n“Um, Veil?” Red said. “That crossbow bolt … the blood is staining your\noutfit.”\n“I wash going to shrow it away regardlesh,” she said, settling back\ndown, growing more comfortable as Pattern rejoined the wagon and\nscuttled across the seat to her. “I’ve got a new outfit almosht ready.”\nAt this rate, she’d have to buy them in bulk.\nThey maneuvered the wagon out the gates, then picked up Vathah. No\nguards gave pursuit, and Veil’s mind … drifted as they pulled away.\nThat … that crossbow bolt was getting annoying. She couldn’t feel her\nsafehand. Bother. She poked at the bolt; it seemed that her Stormlight had\nhealed her head around the wound. She gritted her teeth and tried to pull it\nout, but the thing was jammed in there. Her vision blurred again.\n“I’m going to need shome help, boysh,” she said, pointing at it and\ndrawing in more Stormlight.\nShe blacked out entirely when Vathah pulled it free. She came to a short\ntime later, slumped in the front seat of the wagon. When she brushed the\nside of her head with her fingers, she found no hole.\n“You worry me sometimes,” Vathah said, steering the chull with a reed.\n“I do what needs to be done,” Veil said, relaxing back and setting her\nfeet up on the front of the wagon. Was it only her imagination, or did the\npeople lining the streets today look hungrier than they had previous days?\nHungerspren buzzed about the heads of the people, like black specks, or\nlittle flies of the type you could find sometimes on rotting plants.

Shallan knew little more, and wanted to find a book\nabout the subject, of course.\nLast night, Veil had returned to the inn where Shallan had met with the\nKing’s Wit, and while he hadn’t been there, he’d left a message for her.\nI’m still trying to get you a contact among the cult’s highers. Everyone I talk to merely\nsays, “Do something to get their attention.” I would, but I’m certain that violating the\ncity’s indecency laws would be unwise, even considering the lack of a proper watch.\nDo something to get their attention. They seemed to have their fingers in\neverything, in this city. Kind of like the Ghostbloods. Watching secretly.\nMaybe she didn’t need to wait for Wit. And maybe she could solve two\nproblems at once.\n“Take us to the Ringington Market,” she said to Vathah, naming the\nmarket closest to the tailor’s shop.\n“Aren’t we going to unload the food before we return the wagon to that\nmerchant?”\n“Of course we are,” she said.\nHe eyed her, but when she didn’t explain further, he turned the wagon as\nshe directed. Veil took her hat and coat from the back of the wagon and\npulled them on, then covered the bloodstains on her shirt with a\nLightweaving.\nShe had Vathah pull up to a specific building in the market. When they\nstopped, refugees peeked into the wagon bed, but saw only rugs—and they\nscattered when Vathah glared at them.\n“Guard the wagon,” Veil said, digging out a small sack of food. She\nhopped down and went sauntering toward the building. The roof had been\nruined by the Everstorm, making it a perfect place for squatters. She found\nGrund inside the main room, as usual.\nShe’d returned several times during her time in the city, getting\ninformation from Grund—who was the grimy little urchin she’d bribed with\nfood on her first day in the market. He seemed to always be hanging around\nhere, and Veil was well aware of the value of having a local urchin to ply\nfor information.\nToday, he was alone in the room. The other beggars were out hunting\nfood. Grund drew on a little board with charcoal, using his one good hand,\nthe deformed one hidden in his pocket. He perked up as soon as he saw her.\nHe’d stopped running away; it seemed that city urchins got concerned when\nsomeone was actively looking for them.\nThat changed when they knew you had food.\nHe tried to look uninterested until Veil dropped the sack in front of him.\nA sausage peeked out. Then, his dark eyes practically bulged out of his face.\n“An entire sack?” Grund asked.\n“It was a good day,” Veil said, squatting down. “Any news for me on\nthose books?”\n“Nope,” he said, poking the sausage—as if to see whether she’d\nsuddenly snatch it back. “I ain’t heard nothing.”\n“Let me know if you do. In the meantime, do you know of anyone who\ncould use a little extra food? People who are particularly nice or deserving,\nbut who get overlooked by the grain rationing?”\nHe eyed her, trying to determine her angle."

People who are particularly nice or deserving,\nbut who get overlooked by the grain rationing?”\nHe eyed her, trying to determine her angle.\n“I’ve got extra to give away,” Veil explained.\n“You’re going to give them food.” He said it as if it was as rational as\nmaking cremlings fall from the sky.\n“Surely I’m not the first. The palace used to give food to the poor, didn’t\nit?”\n“That’s a thing that kings do. Not regular people.” He looked her up and\ndown. “But you aren’t regular people.”\n“I’m not.”\n“Well … Muri the seamstress has always been nice to me. She’s got lots\nof kids. Having trouble feedin’ them. She has a hovel over by the old bakery\nthat burned down on that first Evernight. And the refugee kids that live in\nthe park over on Moonlight Way. They’re just little, you know? Nobody to\nwatch for them. And Jom, the cobbler. He broke his arm … You wanna\nwrite this down or something?”\n“I’ll remember.”\nHe shrugged and gave her an extensive list. She thanked him, then\nreminded him to keep looking for the book she’d asked for. Ishnah had\nvisited some booksellers on Shallan’s orders, and one had mentioned a title\ncalled Mythica, a newer volume that spoke of the Unmade. The bookseller\nhad owned a copy, but his shop had been robbed during the riots. Hopefully,\nsomeone in the underground knew where his goods had gone.\nVeil had a spring to her step as she walked back to the wagon. The cult\nwanted her to get their attention? Well, she’d get their attention. She\ndoubted Grund’s list was unbiased, but stopping right in the middle of the\nmarket and heaving out sacks seemed likely to incite a riot. This was as\ngood a method to give away the food as any.\nMuri the seamstress proved to indeed be a woman with many children\nand little means of feeding them. The children in the park were right where\nGrund had indicated. Veil left a heap of food for them, then walked away as\nthey scrambled up to it in amazement.\nBy the fourth stop, Vathah had figured it out. “You’re going to give it all\naway, aren’t you?”\n“Not all,” Veil said, lounging in her seat as they rolled toward the next\ndestination.\n“What about paying the Cult of Moments?”\n“We can always steal more. First, my contact says we have to get their\nattention. I figure, a crazy woman in white riding through the market\nthrowing out sacks of food is bound to do that.”\n“You’ve got the crazy part right, at least.”\nVeil slipped her hand back into a rolled-up carpet, and pulled out a\nsausage for him. “Eat something. It’ll make you feel better.”\nHe grumbled, but took it and bit at the end.\nBy the evening, the cart was empty. Veil wasn’t certain if she could get\nthe cult’s attention this way, but storms did it feel good to be doing\nsomething. Shallan could go off and study books, talk plots, and scheme.\nVeil would worry about the people who were actually starving.\nShe didn’t give it all away though. She let Vathah keep his sausage.\n73.

For valor.”\n“Liar.”\n“Be careful,” Beard said. “Kal might stab you if you keep interrupting a\ngood story.”\n“Me?” Kaladin said, walking with the others of the squad on patrol.\n“Don’t bring me into this, Beard.”\n“Look at him,” Beard said. “He’s got hungry eyes, Ved. He wants to hear\nthe end of the story.”\nKaladin smiled with the others. He had joined the Wall Guard officially\nupon Elhokar’s orders, and had promptly been added to Lieutenant Noro’s\nsquad. It felt almost … cheap to be part of the group so quickly, after the\neffort it had been to forge Bridge Four.\nStill, Kaladin liked these men, and enjoyed their banter as they ran their\npatrol beat along the inside base of the wall. Six men was a lot for a simple\npatrol, but Azure wanted them to stay in groups. Along with Beard, Ved,\nand Noro, the squad included a heavyset man named Alaward and a friendly\nman named Vaceslv—Alethi, but with obvious Thaylen heritage. The two\nkept trying to get Kaladin to play cards with them.\nIt was an uncomfortable reminder of Sah and the parshmen.\n“Well, you won’t believe what happened next,” Beard continued. “The\nBlackthorn told me … Oh, storm it. You’re not listening, are you?”\n“Nope,” Ved said. “Too busy looking at that.” He nodded back at\nsomething they’d passed.\nBeard snickered. “Ha! Will you look at that roosting chicken? Who does\nhe think he’s impressing?”\n“Storming waste of skin,” Ved agreed.\nKal grinned, glanced over his shoulder, looking for whoever Beard and\nVed had spotted. Must be someone silly to provoke such a strong …\nIt was Adolin.\nThe prince lounged on the corner, wearing a false face and a yellow suit\nafter the new fashionable style. He was guarded by Drehy, who stood\nseveral inches taller, happily munching on some chouta.\n“Somewhere,” Beard said solemnly, “a kingdom is without its banners\nbecause that fellow bought them all up and made coats out of them.”\n“Where do they think up these things?” Vaceslv asked. “I mean …\nstorms! Do they just say, ‘You know what I need for the apocalypse? You\nknow what would be really handy? A new coat. Extra sequins.’ ”\nThey passed Adolin—who nodded toward Kaladin, then looked away.\nThat meant all was well, and Kaladin could continue with the guards.

When I was done, I still wasn’t as colorful as\nthat preening cremling.”\nAlaward grunted. “Storming highborns. Useless for anything but giving\nbad orders and eating twice as much food as an honest man.”\n“But,” Kaladin said, “how can you say that? I mean, he’s lighteyed. Like\nus.” He winced. Did that sound fake? It sure is nice being lighteyed as I, of\ncourse, have light eyes—like you, my eyes are lighter than the dark eyes of\ndarkeyes. He had to summon Syl several times a day to keep his eye color\nfrom changing.\n“Like us?” Beard said. “Kal, what crevasse have you been living in? Are\nthe middlers actually useful where you come from?”\n“Some,” Kaladin said.\nBeard and Ved—well, the whole squad, except Noro—were tenners: men\nof the tenth dahn, lowest ranking in the lighteyed stratification system.\nKaladin hadn’t ever paid much attention; to him, lighteyes had always just\nbeen lighteyes.\nThese men saw the world very differently. Middlers were anyone better\nthan eighth dahn, but who weren’t quite highlords. They might as well have\nbeen another species, for how the squadsmen thought of them—particularly\nthose of the fifth and sixth dahn who didn’t serve in the military.\nHow was it that these men somehow naturally ended up surrounding\nthemselves with others of their own rank? They married tenners, drank with\ntenners, joked with tenners. They had their own jargon and traditions. There\nwas an entire world represented here that Kaladin had never seen, despite it\nresiding right next door to him.\n“Some middlers are useful,” Kaladin said. “Some of them are good at\ndueling. Maybe we could go back and recruit that guy. He was wearing a\nsword.”\nThe others looked at him like he was mad.\n“Kal, my kip,” Beard said. “Kip” was a slang word that Kaladin hadn’t\nquite figured out yet. “You’re a good fellow. I like how you see the best in\nfolks. You haven’t even learned to ignore me yet, which most folks decide\nto do after our first meal together.\n“But you’ve got to learn to see the world for how it is. You can’t go\naround trusting middlers, unless they’re good officers like the highmarshal.\nMen like that one back there, they’ll strut about telling you everything you\nshould do—but put them on the wall during an attack, and they’ll wet\nthemselves yellower than that suit.”\n“They have parties,” Ved agreed. “Best thing for them, really. Keeps\nthem out of our business.”\nWhat a strange mix of emotions. On one hand, he wanted to tell them\nabout Amaram and rant about the injustices done—repeatedly—to those he\nloved.

At the same time … they were mocking Adolin Kholin, who had a\nshot at the title of best swordsman in all of Alethkar. Yes, his suit was a little\nbright—but if they would merely spend five minutes talking to him, they’d\nsee he wasn’t so bad.\nKaladin trudged along. It felt wrong to be on patrol without a spear, and\nhe instinctively sought out Syl, who rode the winds above. He’d been given\na side sword to carry at his right, a truncheon to carry at his left, and a small\nround shield. The first thing the Wall Guard had taught him was how to\ndraw the sword by reaching down with his right hand—not lowering his\nshield—and pulling it free of the sheath.\nThey wouldn’t use sword or truncheon when the Voidbringers finally\nassaulted; there were proper pikes up above for that. Down here was a\ndifferent matter. The large road—it rounded the city alongside the wall—\nwas clear and clean, maintained by the Guard. But most of the streets that\nbranched off it were crowded with people. Nobody but the poorest and most\nwretched wanted to be this close to the walls.\n“How is it,” Ved said, “those refugees can’t get it through their heads\nthat we’re the only thing separating them from the army outside?”\nIndeed, many of those they passed on side streets watched the patrol\nwith outright hostility. At least nobody had thrown anything at them today.\n“They see that we’re fed,” Noro replied. “They smell food from our\nbarracks. They’re not thinking with their heads, but with their stomachs.”\n“Half of those belong to the cult anyway,” Beard noted. “One of these\ndays, I’ll have to infiltrate that. Might have to marry their high priestess, but\nlet me tell you, I’m terrible in a harem. Last time, the other men grew\njealous of me taking all the priestess’s attention.”\n“She laughed so hard at your offering she got distracted, eh?” Ved asked.\n“Actually, there’s a story about—”\n“Calm it, Beard,” the lieutenant said. “Let’s get ready for the delivery.”\nHe shifted his shield to his other hand, then took out his truncheon. “Get\nintimidating, everybody. Truncheons only.”\nThe group pulled out their wooden cudgels. It felt wrong to have to\ndefend themselves from their own people—brought back memories of\nbeing in Amaram’s army, bivouacking near towns. Everyone had always\ntalked about the glories of the army and the fight on the Shattered Plains.\nAnd yet, once towns got done gawking, they transitioned to hostility with\nremarkable speed. An army was the sort of thing everyone wanted to have,\nso long as it was off doing important things elsewhere.\nNoro’s squad met up with another from their platoon—with two squads\non the wall for duty, two squads off, and two down here patrolling, they\nwere around forty strong. Together, the twelve men formed up to guard a\nslow, chull-pulled wagon that left one of their larger barrack warehouses.

He\nhad to use his shield to shove a man who got too close. Fortunately, this\ncaused others to back away, instead of rushing the wagon.\nThey rolled inward only one street before stopping at a city square. Syl\nflitted down and rested on his shoulder. “They … they look like they hate\nyou.”\n“Not me,” Kaladin whispered. “The uniform.”\n“What … what will you do if they actually attack?”\nHe didn’t know. He hadn’t come to this city to fight the populace, but if\nhe refused to defend the squad …\n“Storming Velalant is late,” Ved grumbled.\n“A little more time,” Noro said. “We’ll be fine. The good people know\nthis food goes to them eventually.”\nYes, after they wait hours in line at Velalant’s distribution stations.\nFarther into the city—obscured by the gathering crowds—a group of\npeople approached in stark violet, with masks obscuring their faces. Kaladin\nwatched uncomfortably as they started whipping their own forearms.\nDrawing painspren, which climbed from the ground around them, like\nhands missing the skin. Except these were too large, and the wrong color,\nand … and didn’t seem human.\n“I prayed to the spren of the night and they came to me!” a man at their\nforefront shouted, raising hands high. “They rid me of my pain!”\n“Oh no…” Syl whispered.\n“Embrace them! The spren of changes! The spren of a new storm, a new\nland. A new people!”\nKaladin took Noro by the arm. “Sir, we need to retreat. Get this grain\nback to the warehouse.”\n“We have orders to…” Noro trailed off as he glanced at the increasingly\nhostile crowd.\nFortunately, a group of some fifty men in blue and red rounded a corner\nand began shoving aside refugees with rough hands and barked shouts.\nNoro’s sigh was almost comically loud. The angry crowd broke away as\nVelalant’s troops surrounded the grain shipment.\n“Why do we do this in the daytime?” Kaladin asked one of their officers.\n“And why don’t you simply come to our warehouse and escort it from\nthere? Why the display?”\nA soldier moved him—politely, but firmly—back from the wagon. The\ntroops surrounded it and marched it away, the crowd flowing after them.\nWhen they got back to the wall, Kaladin felt like a man seeing land after\nswimming all the way to Thaylenah. He pressed his palm against the stone,\nfeeling its cool, rough grain. Drawing a sense of safety from it, much as he\nwould draw out Stormlight. It would have been easy to fight that crowd—\nthey were basically unarmed. But while training prepared you for the\nmechanics of the fight, the emotions were another thing entirely. Syl\nhuddled on his shoulder, staring back along the street.\n“This is all the queen’s fault,” Beard muttered softly. “If she hadn’t\nkilled that ardent…”\n“Stop with that,” Noro said sharply.

You have half an hour to grab a drink or a nap, then\nassemble at our station above.”\n“And storms be praised for that!” Beard said, heading straight for the\nstairwell, obviously planning to get to the station above, then relax. “I’ll\nhappily take some time staring down an enemy army, thank you very\nmuch.”\nKaladin joined Beard in climbing. He still didn’t know where the man\nhad gotten his nickname. Noro was the only one in the squad who wore a\nbeard, though his wasn’t exactly inspiring. Rock would have laughed it to\nshame and euthanized it with a razor and some soap.\n“Why do we pay off the highlords, Beard?” Kaladin asked as they\nclimbed. “Velalant and his type are pretty useless, from what I’ve seen.”\n“Yeah. We lost the real highlords in the riots or to the palace. But the\nhighmarshal knows what to do. I suspect that if we didn’t share with people\nlike Velalant, we’d have to fight them off from seizing the grain. At least\nthis way, people are eventually getting fed, and we can watch the wall.”\nThey talked like that a lot. Holding the city wall was their job, and if\nthey looked too far afield—tried too hard to police the city or bring down\nthe cult—they’d lose their focus. The city had to stand. Even if it burned\ninside, it had to stand. To an extent, Kaladin agreed. The army couldn’t do\neverything.\nIt still hurt.\n“When are you going to tell me how we make all that food?” Kaladin\nwhispered.\n“I…” Beard looked around in the stairwell. He leaned in. “I don’t know,\nKal. But first thing that Azure did when he took command? Had us attack\nthe low monastery, by the eastern gates, away from the palace. I know men\nfrom other companies who were on that assault. The place had been overrun\nby rioters.”\n“They had a Soulcaster, didn’t they?”\nBeard nodded. “Only one in the city that wasn’t at the palace when it …\nyou know.”\n“But how do we use it without drawing the screamers?” Kaladin asked.\n“Well,” Beard said, and his tone shifted. “I can’t tell you all the secrets,\nbut…” He launched into a story about the time Beard himself had learned to\nuse a Soulcaster from the king of Herdaz. Maybe he wasn’t the best source\nof information.\n“The highmarshal,” Kaladin interrupted. “Have you noticed the odd\nthing about her Shardblade? No gemstone on the pommel or crossguard.”\nBeard eyed him, lit by the stairwell’s window slits. Calling the\nhighmarshal a “she” always provoked a response. “Maybe that’s why the\nhighmarshal never dismisses it,” Beard said. “Maybe it’s broken\nsomehow?”\n“Maybe,” Kaladin said.

        "text": "somehow?”\n“Maybe,” Kaladin said. Aside from his fellow Radiants’ Blades, he’d\nseen one Shardblade before that didn’t have a gemstone on it. The Blade of\nthe Assassin in White. An Honorblade, which granted Radiant powers to\nwhoever held it. If Azure held a weapon that let her have the power of\nSoulcasting, perhaps that explained why the screamers hadn’t found out yet.\nThey finally emerged onto the top of the wall, stepping into sunlight. The\ntwo of them stopped there, looking inward over the flowing city—with the\nbreaching windblades and rolling hills. The palace, ever in gloom,\ndominated the far side. The Wall Guard barely patrolled the section of wall\nthat passed behind it.\n“Did you know anyone in the Palace Guard ranks?” Kaladin asked. “Are\nany of the men in there still in contact with families out here or anything?”\nBeard shook his head. “I got close a little while back. I heard voices,\nKal. Whispering to me to join them. The highmarshal says we have to close\nour ears to those. They can’t take us unless we listen.” He rested his hand\non Kaladin’s shoulder. “Your questions are honest, Kal. But you worry too\nmuch. We need to focus on the wall. Best not to talk too much about the\nqueen, or the palace.”\n“Like we don’t talk about Azure being a woman.”\n“Her secret”—Beard winced—“I mean, the highmarshal’s secret is ours\nto guard and protect.”\n“We do a storming poor job of that, then. Hopefully we’re better at\ndefending the wall.”\nBeard shrugged, hand still on Kaladin’s shoulder. For the first time,\nKaladin noticed something. “No glyphward.”\nBeard glanced at his arm, where he wore the traditional white armband\nthat you’d tie a glyphward around. His was blank. “Yeah,” he said, shoving\nhis hand in his coat pocket.\n“Why not?” Kaladin said.\nBeard shrugged. “Let’s just say, I know a lot about telling which stories\nhave been made up. Nobody’s watching over us, Kal.”\nHe trudged off toward their muster station: one of the tower structures\nthat lined the wall. Syl stood up on Kaladin’s shoulder, then walked up—as\nif on invisible steps—through the air to stand even with his eyes. She\nlooked after Beard, her girlish dress rippling in wind that Kaladin couldn’t\nfeel. “Dalinar thinks God isn’t dead,” she said. “Just that the Almighty—\nHonor—was never actually God.”\n“You’re part of Honor. Doesn’t that offend you?”\n“Every child eventually realizes that her father isn’t actually God.” She\nlooked at him. “Do you think anybody is watching? Do you really think\nthere isn’t anything out there?”\nStrange question to answer, to a little bit of a divinity.\nKaladin lingered in the doorway to the guard tower. Inside, the men of\nhis squad—Platoon Seven, Squad Two, which didn’t have the same ring to\nit as Bridge Four—laughed and banged about as they gathered equipment.\n“I used to take the terrible things that had happened to me,” he said, “as\nproof that there was no god.

Then in some of my darkest moments, I took\nmy life as proof there must be something up there, for only intentional\ncruelty could offer an explanation.”\nHe took a deep breath, then looked toward the clouds. He had been\ndelivered up to the sky, and had found magnificence there. He’d been given\nthe power to protect and defend.\n“Now,” he said. “Now I don’t know. With all due respect, I think\nDalinar’s beliefs sound too convenient. Now that one deity has proven\nfaulty, he insists the Almighty must never have been God? That there must\nbe something else? I don’t like it. So … maybe this simply isn’t a question\nwe can ever answer.”\nHe stepped into the fortification. It had broad doorways on either side\nleading in from the wall, while slits along the outward side provided archer\npositions, as did the roof. To his right stood racks of weapons and shields,\nand a table for mess. Above that, a large window looked out at the city\nbeyond, where those inside could get specific orders via signal flags from\nbelow.\nHe was sliding his shield onto a rack when the drums sounded, calling\nthe alarm. Syl zipped up behind him like string suddenly pulled taut.\n“Assault on the wall!” Kaladin shouted, reading the drumbeats. “Equip\nup!” He scrambled across the room and seized a pike from the line on the\nwall. He tossed it to the first man who came, then continued distributing as\nthe men scrambled to obey the signals. Lieutenant Noro and Beard handed\nout shields—rectangular full shields in contrast to the small round patrolling\nshields they’d carried below.\n“Form up!” Kaladin shouted, right before Noro did it.\nStorms. I’m not their commander. Feeling like an idiot, Kaladin took his\nown pike and balanced the long pole, carrying it out beside Beard, who\ncarried only a shield. On the wall, the four squads formed a bristling\nformation of pikes and overlapping shields. Some of the men in the center\n—like Kaladin and Noro—held only a pike, gripping it two-handed.\nSweat trickled down Kaladin’s temples. He’d been trained briefly in pike\nblocks during his time in Amaram’s army. They were used as a counter to\nheavy cavalry, which was a newer development in Alethi warfare. He\ncouldn’t imagine that they’d be terribly effective atop a wall. They were\ngreat for thrusting outward toward an enemy block of troops, but it was\ndifficult for him to keep the pike pointed upward. It didn’t balance well that\nway, but how else were they to fight the Fused?\nThe other platoon that shared a station with them formed up on the\ntower’s top, holding bows. Hopefully, the arrow cover mixed with the\ndefensive pike formation would be effective. Kaladin finally saw the Fused\nstreaking through the air—approaching another section of the wall.\nMen in his platoon waited, nervous, adjusting glyphwards or\nrepositioning shields.

The drumbeats from the\ndrummers’ stations were a holding beat, telling everyone to remain in their\nown section.\nSyl came zipping back, moving agitatedly, sweeping one way, then the\nother. Several men in the formation leaned out, as if wanting to break away\nand go charging to where their fellows were fighting.\nSteady, Kaladin thought, but cut himself off from saying it. He wasn’t in\ncommand here. Captain Deedanor, the platoon leader, hadn’t arrived yet—\nwhich meant Noro was the ranking officer, with seniority over the other\nsquad lieutenants. Kaladin gritted his teeth, straining, forcibly keeping\nhimself from giving any kind of order until—blessedly—Noro spoke up.\n“Now, don’t you break away, Hid,” the lieutenant called. “Keep your\nshields together, men. If we rush off now, we’ll be easy pickings.”\nThe men reluctantly pulled back into formation. Eventually, the Fused\nstreaked away. Their strikes never lasted long; they would hit hard, testing\nreaction times at various places along the wall—and they often broke into\nand searched the towers nearby. They were preparing for a true assault, and\n—Kaladin figured—also trying to find out how the Wall Guard was feeding\nitself.\nThe drums signaled for the squads to stand down, and the men of\nKaladin’s platoon lethargically trudged back to their tower. A sense of\nfrustration accompanied them. Pent-up aggression. All of that anxiety, the\nrush of the battle, only to stand around and sweat while other men died.\nKaladin helped rack up the weapons, then got himself a bowl of stew and\njoined Lieutenant Noro, who was waiting on the wall right outside the\ntower. A messenger used signal flags to indicate to others down in the city\nthat Noro’s platoon hadn’t engaged.\n“You have my apologies, sir,” Kaladin said softly. “I’ll see it doesn’t\nhappen again.”\n“Um … it?”\n“I preempted you earlier,” Kaladin said. “Gave orders when it was your\nplace.”\n“Oh! Well, you’re quite quick off the cuff, Kal! Eager for combat, I’d\nsay.”\n“Perhaps, sir.”\n“You want to prove yourself to the team,” Noro said, rubbing his wispy\nbeard. “Well, I like a man with enthusiasm. Keep your head, and I suspect\nyou’ll end up as a squadleader before too long.” He said it like a proud\nparent.\n“Permission, sir, to be excused from duty? There might be wounded that\nneed my attention farther along the wall.”\n“Wounded? Kal, I know you said you had some field medicine training\n—but the army’s surgeons will be there already.”\nRight, they’d have actual surgeons.\nNoro clapped him on the shoulder. “Go in and eat your stew. There will\nbe enough action later. Don’t run too fast toward danger, all right?”\n“I’ll … try to remember that, sir.”\nStill, there was nothing to do but walk back into the tower, Syl alighting"

Grund the urchin sat in his usual place, carefully stripping\ndown an old pair of shoes for the hogshide. As he heard Veil, he dropped his\ntool and reached for a knife with his good hand.\nHe saw that it was her, then caught the package of food she tossed to\nhim. It was smaller this time, but actually had some fruit. Very rare in the\ncity these days. The urchin pulled the bag of food close, closing his dark\ngreen eyes, looking … reserved. What an odd expression.\nHe’s still suspicious of me, she thought. He’s wondering what I’ll\nsomeday demand of him for all this.\n“Where are Ma and Seland?” Veil asked. She had prepared packages for\nthe two women who stayed here with Grund.\n“Moved out to the old tinker’s place,” Grund said. He thumbed upward,\ntoward the sagging ceiling. “Thought this place was getting too dangerous.”\n“You sure you don’t want to do the same?”\n“Nah,” he said. “I can finally move without kicking someone.”\nShe left him and shoved her hands in her pockets, wearing her new coat\nand hat against the cool air. She’d hoped that Kholinar would prove to be\nwarmer, after so long on the Shattered Plains or Urithiru. But it was cold\nhere too, suffering a season of winter weather. Perhaps the arrival of the\nEverstorm was to be blamed.\nShe checked in on Muri next, the former seamstress with three\ndaughters. She was of second nahn, high ranking for a darkeyes, and had\nrun a successful business in a town near Revolar. Now she trolled the water\nditches following storms for the corpses of rats and cremlings.\nMuri always had some gossip that was amusing but generally pointless.\nVeil left about an hour later and made her way out of the market, dropping\nher last package in the lap of a random beggar.\nThe old beggar sniffed the package, then whooped with excitement.\n“The Swiftspren!” he said, nudging one of the other beggars. “Look, the\nSwiftspren!” He cackled, digging into the package, and his friend roused\nfrom his sleep and snatched some flatbread.\n“Swiftspren?” Veil asked.\n“That’s you!” he said. “Yup, yup! I heard of you. Robbing rich folk all\nthrough the city, you do! And nobody can stop you, ’cuz you’re a spren.\nCan walk through walls, you can. White hat, white coat.

She’d enhanced it by sending Ishnah and Vathah out, wearing\nillusions to look like Veil, giving away food. Surely, the cult couldn’t ignore\nher much longer. Pattern hummed as she stretched, exhaustionspren—all of\nthe corrupted variety—spinning about her in the air, little red whirlwinds.\nThe merchant she’d stolen from earlier had chased her away himself, and\nhad been nimble for his age.\n“Why?” Pattern asked.\n“Why what?” Veil asked. “Why is the sky blue, the sun bright? Why do\nstorms blow, or rains fall?”\n“Mmmm … Why are you so happy about feeding so few?”\n“Feeding these few is something we can do.”\n“So is jumping from a building,” he said—frank, as if he didn’t\nunderstand the sarcasm he used. “But we do not do this. You lie, Shallan.”\n“Veil.”\n“Your lies wrap other lies. Mmm…” He sounded drowsy. Could spren\nget drowsy? “Remember your Ideal, the truth you spoke.”\nShe shoved hands in her pockets. Evening was coming, the sun slipping\ntoward the western horizon. As if it were running from the Origin and the\nstorms.\nIt was the individual touch, the light in the eyes of people she gave to,\nthat really excited her. Feeding them felt so much more real than the rest of\nthe plan to infiltrate the cult and investigate the Oathgate.\nIt’s too small, she thought. That was what Jasnah would say. I’m thinking\ntoo small.\nAlong the street, she passed people who whimpered and suffered. Far too\nmany hungerspren in the air, and fearspren at nearly every corner. She had\nto do something to help.\nLike throwing a thimbleful of water onto a bonfire.\nShe stood at an intersection, head bowed, as the shadows grew long,\nreaching toward night. Chanting broke her out of her trance. How long had\nshe been standing there?\nFlickering light, orange and primal, painted a street to her left. No sphere\nglowed that color. She walked toward it, pulling off her hat and sucking in\nStormlight. She released it in a puff, then stepped through, trailing tendrils\nthat wrapped around her and transformed her shape.\nPeople had gathered, as they usually did, when the Cult of Moments\nparaded. Swiftspren broke through them, wearing the costume of a spren\nfrom her notes—notes she’d lost to the sea. A spren shaped like a glowing\narrowhead that wove through the sky around skyeels.\nGolden tassels streamed from her back, long, with arrowhead shapes at\nthe ends. Her entire front was wrapped in cloth that trailed behind, her arms,\nlegs, and face covered. Swiftspren flowed among the cultists, and drew\nstares even from them.\nI have to do more, she thought.

She’d initially thought that this group might\nlead her up to the revel on the Oathgate platform, but … she’d let herself be\ncarried away by the darkness. Trembling, she stopped in place.\nThe others stopped around her. The illusion—the sprenlike tassels\nbehind her—continued to stream, even when she wasn’t walking. There was\nno wind.\nThe cultists’ chanting broke off, and corrupted awespren exploded\naround several of their heads. Soot-black puffs. Some fell to their knees. To\nthem—wrapped in streaming cloth, face obscured, ignoring wind and\ngravity—she would look like an actual spren.\n“There are spren,” Shallan said to the gathered crowd, using\nLightweaving to twist and warp her voice, “and there are spren. You\nfollowed the dark ones. They whisper for you to abandon yourselves. They\nlie.”\nThe cultists gasped.\n“We do not want your devotion. When have spren ever demanded your\ndevotion?

A powerful light flashed\nfrom her.\n“Go!” she shouted.\nThey fled, some throwing off their costumes as they went. Shallan\nwaited, trembling, until she was alone. She let the glow vanish and\nshrouded herself in blackness, then stepped off the street.\nWhen she emerged from the blackness, she looked like Veil again.\nStorms.

That red-violet glow was the room’s only light. On\nthe table before him was a sheet of glyphs: names of the houses he had been\napproaching, through the parties. He’d crossed out some of the names, but\nhad circled the others, writing down numbers of troops they might be able\nto provide.

Pattern, who usually clung to her coat, had been\nreplicated in the illusion on the side of her havah. “Familiar?”\nElhokar nodded.

It doesn’t even matter now,\ndoes it?

A good Vorin worries about transforming themselves.”\nGive me your passion.…\n“Have you any news about the Oathgate or the Cult of Moments?”\nElhokar asked.\n“No. I have some thoughts about getting up there though. New ones.”\n“Good. I might have troops for us soon, though their numbers will be\nsmaller than I’d hoped. We depend upon your reconnaissance, however. I\nwould know what is happening on that platform before I march troops onto\nit.”\n“Give me a few more days.

Primarily archers, they wore no armor, and were trained for\nlong-distance running. Horses were magnificent beasts; the Sunmaker\nfamously had used an entire company of cavalry. Over a short distance,\ntheir speed and maneuverability had been legendary.\nThose possibilities intrigued Dalinar. Could men be trained to fire bows\nfrom horseback? How devastating would that be? What about a charge of\nhorses bearing men with spears, like the legends spoke of during the Shin\ninvasion?\nFor today, however, he didn’t need horses. Men were better suited for\nlong-distance running, not to mention being much better at scrambling over\nbroken hillsides and uneven rocks. This company of elites could outrun any\nharrying force he’d yet to meet. Though archers, they were proficient with\nthe sword. Their training was unparalleled, and their stamina legendary.\nDalinar hadn’t trained with them personally, as he didn’t have time to\npractice running thirty miles a day. Fortunately, he had Plate to make up the\ndifference. Clad in his armor, he led the charging force over scrub and rock,\npast reeds that released hairlike inner strands to shiver on the breeze until he\ndrew near. Grass, tree, and weed took fright at his approach.\nTwo fires burned inside him. First the energy of the Plate, lending power\nto each step. The second fire was the Thrill. Sadeas, a traitor? Impossible.\nHe had supported Gavilar all along. Dalinar trusted him.\nAnd yet …\nI thought myself trustworthy, Dalinar thought, leading the charge down a"

Dalinar trusted him.\nAnd yet …\nI thought myself trustworthy, Dalinar thought, leading the charge down a\nhillside, a hundred men flooding behind him. Yet I almost turned on Gavilar.\nHe would see for himself. He would find out whether this “caravan” that\nhad brought supplies to the Rift actually had a Shardbearer in its ranks or\nnot. But the possibility that he had been betrayed—that Sadeas could have\nbeen working against them all along—drove Dalinar to a kind of focused\nmadness. A clarity only the Thrill bestowed.\nIt was the focus of a man, his sword, and the blood he would spill.\nThe Thrill seemed to transform within him as he ran, soaking into his\ntiring muscles, saturating him. It became a power unto itself. So, when they\ncrested a hillside some distance south of the Rift, he felt somehow more\nenergetic than when he’d left.\nAs his company of elites jogged up, Dalinar pulled to a stop, armored\nfeet grinding on stone. Ahead, down the hill and at the mouth of a canyon, a\nfrantic group was scrambling to arms. The caravan. Its scouts must have\nspotted the approach of Dalinar’s force.\nThey’d been setting up camp, but left their tents, running for the canyon,\nwhere they’d be able to avoid being flanked. Dalinar roared, summoning his\nBlade, ignoring the fatigue of his men as he dashed down the hillside.\nThe soldiers wore forest green and white. Sadeas’s colors.\nDalinar reached the bottom of the hill and stormed through the now-\nabandoned camp. He swept past the stragglers, slicing out with Oathbringer,\ndropping them, their eyes burning.\nWait.\nHis momentum wouldn’t let him stop now. Where was the enemy\nShardbearer?\nSomething is wrong.\nDalinar led his men into the canyon after the soldiers, following the\nenemy along a wide path up the side. He raised Oathbringer high as he ran.\nWhy would they put on Sadeas’s colors if they’re a secret envoy bringing\ncontraband supplies?\nDalinar stopped in place, his soldiers swarming around him. Their path\nhad taken them about fifty feet up from the bottom of the canyon, on the\nsouth side of a steep incline. He saw no sign of a Shardbearer as the enemy\ngathered above. And … those uniforms …\nHe blinked. That … that was wrong.\nHe shouted an order to pull back, but the sound of his voice was\noverwhelmed by a sudden roar. A sound like thunder, accompanied by a\ndreadful clatter of rock against rock. The ground quivered, and he turned in\nhorror to find a landslide tumbling down the steep side of the ravine to his\nright—directly above where he had led his men.\nHe had a fraction of a moment to take it in before the rocks pounded him\nin a terrible crash.\nEverything spun, then grew black. Still he was pounded, rolled, crushed.\nAn explosion of molten sparks briefly flashed in his eyes, and something\nhard smacked him on the head.\nFinally it ended. He found himself lying in blackness, his head pounding,\nthick warm blood running down his face and dripping from his chin. He"

He\ncould feel the blood, but not see it. Had he been blinded?\nHis cheek was pressed against a rock. No. He wasn’t blind; he’d been\nburied. And his helm had shattered. He shifted with a groan, and something\nilluminated the stones around his head. Stormlight seeping from his\nbreastplate.\nSomehow he’d survived the landslide. He lay facedown, prone, buried.\nHe shifted again, and from the corner of his eye saw a rock sink, threatening\nto crush sideways into his skull. He lay still, his head thundering with pain.\nHe flexed his left hand and found that gauntlet broken, his forearm plate\ntoo. But his right-hand armor still worked.\nThis … this was a trap.…\nSadeas was not a traitor. This had been designed by the Rift and its\nhighlord to lure Dalinar in, then drop stones to crush him. Cowards. They’d\ntried something like that in Rathalas long ago too. He relaxed, groaning\nsoftly.\nNo. Can’t lie here.\nMaybe he could pretend to be dead. That sounded so appealing he closed\nhis eyes and started to drift.\nA fire ignited inside him.\nYou have been betrayed, Dalinar. Listen. He heard voices—men picking\nthrough the wreckage of the rockslide. He could make out their nasal\naccent. Rifters.\nTanalan sent you here to die!\nDalinar sneered, opening his eyes. Those men wouldn’t let him hide in\nthis tomb of stone, feigning death. He carried Shards. They would find him\nto recover their prize.\nHe braced himself, using his Plated shoulder to keep the rock from\nrolling against his exposed head, but did not otherwise move. Eventually\nthe men above started speaking eagerly; from their words, they’d found his\narmor’s cape sticking out through the stone, the glyphs of khokh and linil\nstark on the blue background.\nStones scraped, and the burden upon him lightened. The Thrill built to a\ncrescendo. The stone near his head rolled back.\nGo.\nDalinar heaved with his Plated feet and shifted a boulder with his still-\narmored hand, opening enough space that he could stand up straight. He\nripped free of the tomb and stumbled upright into open air, stones clattering.\nThe Rifters cursed and scrambled backward as he leaped out of the hole,\nboots grinding against stones. Dalinar growled, summoning his Blade.\nHis armor was in worse shape than he’d assumed. Sluggish. Broken in\nfour separate places.\nAll around him, Tanalan’s men’s eyes seemed to glow. They gathered\nand grinned at him; he could see the Thrill thick in their expressions. His\nBlade and leaking Plate reflected in their dark eyes.\nBlood streaming down the side of his face, Dalinar grinned back at them.\nThey rushed to attack.\n* * *\nDalinar saw only red.\nHe partially came to himself as he found himself pounding a man’s head\nrepeatedly against the stones.

Behind him lay a pile of corpses with burned\neyes, piled high around the hole where Dalinar had stood, fighting against\nthem.\nHe dropped the head of the corpse in his hands and breathed out,\nfeeling … What did he feel? Numb, suddenly. Pain was a distant thing.\nEven anger was nebulous. He looked down at his hands. Why was he using\nthose, and not his Shardblade?\nHe turned to the side, where Oathbringer protruded from a rock where\nhe’d stabbed it. The … gemstone on the pommel was cracked. That was\nright. He couldn’t dismiss it; something about the crack had interfered.\nHe stumbled to his feet, looking around for more foes, but none came to\nchallenge him. His armor … someone had broken the breastplate while\nfighting him, and he felt at a stab wound on his chest. He barely\nremembered that.\nThe sun was low on the horizon, plunging the canyon into shadows.\nAround him, discarded bits of clothing flapped in the breeze, and bodies lay\nstill. Not a sound, not even cremling scavengers.\nDrained, he bound the worst of his wounds, then grabbed Oathbringer\nand set it on his shoulder. Never had a Shardblade felt so heavy.\nHe started walking.\nAlong the way, he discarded pieces of Shardplate, which grew too heavy.\nHe’d lost blood. Far too much.\nHe focused on the steps. One after another.\nMomentum. A fight was all about momentum.\nHe didn’t dare take the obvious route, in case he encountered more\nRifters. He crossed through the wilderness, vines writhing beneath his feet\nand rockbuds sprouting after he passed.\nThe Thrill returned to urge him on. For this walk was a fight. A battle.\nNight fell, and he threw off his last piece of Shardplate, leaving only the\nneck brace. They could regrow the rest of it from that, if they had to.\nKeep. Moving.\nIn that darkness, shadowed figures seemed to accompany him. Armies\nmade of red mist at the corners of his vision, charging forces that fell to dust\nand then sprouted from shadow again, like surging ocean waves in a\nconstant state of disintegration and rebirth. Not just men, but eyeless horses.\nAnimals locked in struggle, stifling the life from one another. Shadows of\ndeath and conflict to propel him through the night.\nHe hiked for an eternity. Eternity was nothing when time had no\nmeaning. He was actually surprised when he approached the light of the\nRift, from torches held by soldiers on the walls. His navigation by the\nmoons and stars had been successful.\nHe stalked through the darkness toward his own camp on the field. There\nwas another army here. Sadeas’s actual soldiers; they’d arrived ahead of\nschedule. Another few hours, and Tanalan’s ploy wouldn’t have worked.\nDalinar dragged Oathbringer behind him; it made a soft scraping sound\nas it cut a line in the stone. He numbly heard soldiers talking by the bonfire\nahead, and one called something out. Dalinar ignored them, each step\nrelentless, as he passed into their light. A pair of young soldiers in blue"

A pair of young soldiers in blue\ncrowed their challenges until cutting off and lowering spears, gaping.\n“Stormfather,” one of them said, stumbling back. “Kelek and the\nAlmighty himself!”\nDalinar continued through camp. Noise stirred at his passing, men crying\nof visions of the dead and of Voidbringers. He made for his command tent.\nThe eternity it took to get there seemed the same length as the others. How\ncould he cross so many miles in the same time as it took to go the few feet\nto a simple tent? Dalinar shook his head, seeing red at the sides of his\nvision.\nWords broke through the canvas of the tent. “Impossible. The men are\nspooked. They … No, it’s simply not possible.”\nThe flaps burst apart, revealing a man with fine clothing and wavy hair.\nSadeas gaped, then stumbled to the side, holding the flap for Dalinar, who\ndid not break stride. He walked straight in, Oathbringer slicing a ribbon in\nthe ground.\nInside, generals and officers gathered by the grim light of a few sphere\nlanterns. Evi, comforted by Brightness Kalami, was weeping, though Ialai\nstudied the table full of maps. All eyes turned toward Dalinar.\n“How?” Teleb asked. “Blackthorn? We sent a team of scouts to inform\nyou as soon as Tanalan turned on us and cast our soldiers off his walls. Our\nforce reported all men lost, an ambush…”\nDalinar hefted Oathbringer and slammed it down into the stone ground\nbeside him, then sighed at finally being able to release the burden. He\nplaced his palms on the sides of the battle table, hands crusted in blood. His\narms were covered in it too.\n“You sent the same scouts,” he whispered, “who first spied on the\ncaravan, and reported seeing a Shardbearer leading it?”\n“Yes,” Teleb said.\n“Traitors,” Dalinar said. “They’re working with Tanalan.” He couldn’t\nhave known that Dalinar would parley with him. Instead, the man had\nsomehow bribed away members of the army, and had intended to use their\nreports to coax Dalinar into a hurried ride to the south. Into a trap.\nIt had all been set in motion before Dalinar had spoken to Tanalan.\nPlanned well in advance.\nTeleb barked out orders for the scouts to be imprisoned. Dalinar leaned\ndown over the battle maps on the table. “This is a map for a siege,” he\nwhispered.\n“We…” Teleb looked to Sadeas. “We figured that the king would want\ntime to come down himself. To, um, avenge you, Brightlord.”\n“Too slow,” Dalinar said, his voice ragged.\n“Highprince Sadeas proposed … another option,” Teleb said. “But the\nking—”\nDalinar looked to Sadeas.\n“They used my name to betray you,” Sadeas said, then spat to the side.\n“We will suffer rebellions like this time and time again unless they fear us,\nDalinar.”\nDalinar nodded slowly. “They must bleed,” he whispered. “I want them"

Men, women, children. They must know the punishment\nfor broken oaths. Immediately.”\n“Dalinar?” Evi stood up. “Husband?” She stepped forward, toward the\ntable.\nThen he turned toward her, and she stopped. Her unusual, pale Westerner\nskin grew even more starkly white. She stepped backward, pulling her\nhands toward her chest, and gaped at him, horrified, fearspren growing up\nfrom the ground around her.\nDalinar glanced toward a sphere lantern, which had a polished metal\nsurface. The man who looked back seemed more Voidbringer than man,\nface crusted over with blackened blood, hair matted with it, blue eyes wide,\njaw clenched. He was sliced with what seemed to be a hundred wounds, his\npadded uniform in tatters.\n“You shouldn’t do this,” Evi said. “Rest. Sleep, Dalinar. Think about\nthis. Give it a few days.”\nSo tired …\n“The entire kingdom thinks us weak, Dalinar,” Sadeas whispered. “We\ntook too long to put this rebellion down. You have never listened to me\nbefore, but listen now. You want to prevent this sort of thing from\nhappening again? You must punish them. Every one.”\n“Punish them…” Dalinar said, the Thrill rising again. Pain. Anger.\nHumiliation. He pressed his hands against the map table to steady himself.\n“The Soulcaster that my brother sent. She can make two things?”\n“Grain and oil,” Teleb said.\n“Good. Set her to work.”\n“More food supplies?”\n“No, oil. As much as we have gemstones for. Oh, and someone take my\nwife to her tent so she may recover from her unwarranted grief. Everyone\nelse, gather round. In the morning, we make Rathalas an example. I\npromised Tanalan that his widows would weep for what I did here, but that\nis too merciful for what they’ve done to me.\n“I intend to so thoroughly ruin this place that for ten generations, nobody\nwill dare build here for fear of the spirits who will haunt it. We will make a\npyre of this city, and there shall be no weeping for its passing, for none will\nremain to weep.”\n76. An Animal\nELEVEN YEARS AGO\nDalinar agreed to change clothing. He washed his face and arms, and let a\nsurgeon look at his wounds.\nThe red mist was still there, coloring his vision. He would not sleep. It\nwouldn’t let him.\nAbout an hour after he’d arrived in camp, he trudged back to the\ncommand tent, cleaned but not particularly refreshed.\nThe generals had drawn up a new set of battle plans to take the city\nwalls, as instructed by Sadeas. Dalinar inspected and made a few changes,\nbut told them to suspend making plans to march down into the city and\nclear it. He had something else in mind.\n“Brightlord!” a messenger woman said, arriving at the tent. She stepped\nin. “An envoy is leaving the city. Flying the flag of truce.”\n“Shoot them dead,” Dalinar said calmly."

Flying the flag of truce.”\n“Shoot them dead,” Dalinar said calmly.\n“Sir?”\n“Arrows, woman,” Dalinar said. “Kill anyone who comes out of the city,\nand leave their bodies to rot.”\n“Um, yes, Brightlord.” The messenger ducked away.\nDalinar looked up toward Sadeas, who still wore his Shardplate,\nglittering in the spherelight. Sadeas nodded in approval, then gestured to the\nside. He wanted to speak in private.\nDalinar left the table. He should hurt more. Shouldn’t he? Storms … he\nwas so numb, he could barely feel anything, aside from that burning within,\nsimmering deep down. He stepped with Sadeas out of the tent.\n“I’ve been able to stall the scribes,” Sadeas whispered, “as you ordered.\nGavilar doesn’t know that you live. His orders from before were to wait and\nlay siege.”\n“My return supersedes his distant orders,” Dalinar said. “The men will\nknow that. Even Gavilar wouldn’t disagree.”\n“Yes, but why keep him ignorant of your arrival?”\nThe last moon was close to setting. Not long until morning. “What do\nyou think of my brother, Sadeas?”\n“He’s exactly what we need,” Sadeas said. “Hard enough to lead a war;\nsoft enough to be beloved during peace. He has foresight and wisdom.”\n“Do you think he could do what needs to be done here?”\nSadeas fell silent. “No,” he finally said. “No, not now. I wonder if you\ncan either. This will be more than just death. It will be complete\ndestruction.”\n“A lesson,” Dalinar whispered.\n“A display. Tanalan’s plan was clever, but risky. He knew his chances of\nwinning here depended upon removing you and your Shards from the\nbattle.” He narrowed his eyes. “You thought those soldiers were mine. You\nactually believed I’d betray Gavilar.”\n“I worried.”\n“Then know this, Dalinar,” Sadeas said, low, his voice like stone\ngrinding stone. “I would cut out my own heart before betraying Gavilar. I\nhave no interest in being king—it’s a job with little praise and even less\namusement. I mean for this kingdom to stand for centuries.”\n“Good,” Dalinar said.\n“Honestly, I worried that you would betray him.”\n“I almost did, once. I stopped myself.”\n“Why?”\n“Because,” Dalinar said. “There has to be someone in this kingdom\ncapable of doing what needs to be done, and it can’t be the man sitting on\nthe throne. Continue to hold the scribes back; it will be better if my brother\ncan reasonably disavow what we’re about to do.”\n“Something will leak out soon,” Sadeas said. “Between our two armies,\nthere are too many spanreeds.

Oathbringer still sat\nwhere he’d stuck it into the stones, though an armorer had replaced the\ngemstone for him.\nHe pulled the Blade from the rock. “Time to attack.”\nAmaram turned from where he stood with the other generals. “Now,\nDalinar? At night?”\n“The bonfires on the wall should be enough.”\n“To take the wall fortifications, yes,” Amaram said. “But Brightlord, I\ndon’t relish fighting down into those vertical streets in the night.”\nDalinar shared a look with Sadeas. “Fortunately, you won’t have to.\nSend the word for the men to prepare the oil and flaming brands. We\nmarch.”\nHighmarshal Perethom took the orders and began organizing specifics.\nDalinar lifted Oathbringer on his shoulder. Time to bring you home.\nIn under a half hour, men charged the walls. No Shardbearers led this\ntime; Dalinar was too weak, and his Plate was in shambles. Sadeas never\ndid like exposing himself too early, and Teleb couldn’t rush in alone.\nThey did it the mundane way, sending men to be crushed by stones or\nimpaled by arrows as they carried ladders. They broke through eventually,\nsecuring a section of the wall in a furious, bloody fight.\nThe Thrill was an unsatisfied lump inside Dalinar, but he was wrung out,\nworn down. So he continued to wait until finally, Teleb and Sadeas joined\nthe fight and routed the last of the defenders, sending them down from the\nwalls toward the chasm of the city itself.\n“I need a squad of elites,” Dalinar said softly to a nearby messenger.\n“And my own barrel of oil. Have them meet me inside the walls.”\n“Yes, Brightlord,” the young boy said, then ran off.\nDalinar strode across the field, passing fallen men bloody and dead.\nThey’d died almost in ranks where waves of arrows had struck. He also\npassed a cluster of corpses in white, where the envoy had been slaughtered\nearlier. Warmed by the rising sun, he passed through the now-open gates of\nthe wall and entered the ring of stone that surrounded the Rift.\nSadeas met him there, faceplate up, cheeks even redder than normal from\nexertion. “They fought like Voidbringers. More vicious than last time, I’d\nsay.”\n“They know what is coming,” Dalinar said, walking toward the cliff\nedge. He stopped halfway there.\n“We checked it for a trap this time,” Sadeas noted.\nDalinar continued forward. The Rifters had gotten the better of him\ntwice now. He should have learned the first time. He stopped at the edge of\nthe cliff, looking down at a city built on platforms, rising up along the\nwidening sides of the rift of stone. It was little wonder they thought so\nhighly of themselves as to resist. Their city was grand, a monument of\nhuman ingenuity and grit.\n“Burn it,” Dalinar said.\nArchers gathered with arrows ready to ignite, while other men rolled up\nbarrels of oil and pitch to give extra fuel.\n“There are thousands of people in there, sir,” Teleb said softly from his"

You were smart enough to take it.”\n“And the common people in there, the ones who didn’t get a chance to\nchoose a side?”\nSadeas snorted from nearby. “We will prevent more deaths in the future\nby letting every brightlord in this kingdom know the punishment for\ndisobedience.” He took a report from an aide, then stepped up to Dalinar.\n“You were right about the scouts who turned traitor. We bribed one to turn\non the others, and will execute the rest. The plan was apparently to separate\nyou from the army, then hopefully kill you. Even if you were simply\ndelayed, the Rift was hoping their lies would prompt your army into a\nreckless attack without you.”\n“They weren’t counting on your swift arrival,” Dalinar said.\n“Or your tenacity.”\nThe soldiers unplugged barrels of oil, then began dropping them down,\nsoaking the upper levels of the city. Flaming brands followed—starting\nstruts and walkways on fire. The very foundations of this city were\nflammable.\nTanalan’s soldiers tried to organize a fight back out of the Rift, but they’d\nsurrendered the high ground, expecting Dalinar to do as he had before,\nconquering and controlling.\nHe watched as the fires spread, flamespren rising in them, seeming larger\nand more … angry than normal. He then walked back—leaving a solemn\nTeleb—to gather his remaining elites. Captainlord Kadash had fifty for him,\nalong with two barrels of oil.\n“Follow,” Dalinar said, walking around the Rift on its east side, where\nthe fracture was narrow enough to cross on a short bridge.\nScreams below. Then cries of pain. Calls for mercy. People flooded from\nbuildings, shouting in terror, fleeing on walkways and steps toward the\nbasin below. Many buildings burned, trapping others inside.\nDalinar led his squad along the northern rim of the Rift until they\nreached a certain location. His armies waited here to kill any soldiers who\ntried to break out, but the enemy had concentrated their assault on the other\nside, then been mostly beaten back. The fires hadn’t reached up here yet,\nthough Sadeas’s archers had killed several dozen civilians who had tried to\nflee in this direction.\nFor now, the wooden ramp down into the city was clear. Dalinar led his\ngroup down one level to a location he remembered so well: the hidden door\nset into the wall. It was metal now, guarded by a pair of nervous Rifter\nsoldiers.\nKadash’s men shot them down with shortbows. That annoyed Dalinar;\nall of this fighting, and nothing with which to feed the Thrill.

Nobody tried to flee, though he thought he heard\ncries of pain inside. Dalinar watched as long as he could, until soon the\nsmoke and heat drove him back.\nThe Rift behind him was becoming a pit of darkness and fire. Dalinar\nretreated up the ramp to the stones above. Archers lit the final walkways and\nramps behind him. It would be long before people decided to resettle here.\nHighstorms were one thing, but there was a more terrible force upon the\nland. And it carried a Shardblade.\nThose screams … Dalinar passed lines of soldiers who waited along the\nnorthern rim in silent horror; many wouldn’t have been with Dalinar and\nGavilar during the early years of their conquest, when they’d allowed\npillaging and ransacking of cities. And for those who did remember … well,\nhe’d often found an excuse to stop things like this before.\nHe drew his lips to a line, and shoved down the Thrill. He would not let\nhimself enjoy this. That single sliver of decency he could keep back.\n“Brightlord!” a soldier said, waving to him. “Brightlord, you must see\nthis!”\nJust below the cliff here—one tier down into the city—was a beautiful\nwhite building. A palace. Farther out along the walkways, a group of people\nfought to reach the building. The wooden walkways were on fire, and\npreventing their access. Shocked, Dalinar recognized Tanalan the younger\nfrom their encounter earlier.\nTrying to get into his home? Dalinar thought. Figures darkened the\nbuilding’s upper windows; a woman and children. No. Trying to get to his\nfamily.\nTanalan hadn’t been hiding in the saferoom after all.\n“Throw a rope,” Dalinar said. “Bring Tanalan up here, but shoot down\nthe bodyguards.”\nThe smoke billowing out of the Rift was growing thick, lit red by the\nfires. Dalinar coughed, then stepped back as his men let down a rope to the\nplatform below, a section that wasn’t burning. Tanalan hesitated, then took\nit, letting Dalinar’s men haul him up. The bodyguards were sent arrows\nwhen they tried to climb up a nearby burning ramp.\n“Please,” Tanalan said, clothing ashen from the smoke, as he was hauled\nup over the stone rim. “My family. Please.”\nDalinar could hear them screaming below. He whispered an order, and\nhis elites pushed back the regular Kholin troops from the area, opening up a\nwide half-circle against the burning rift, where only Dalinar and his closest\nmen were able to observe the captive.\nTanalan slumped on the ground. “Please…”\n“I,” Dalinar said softly, “am an animal.”\n“What—”\n“An animal,” Dalinar said, “reacts as it is prodded.

Trouble is, once\nit’s gone feral, you can’t just whistle it back to you.”\n“Blackthorn!” Tanalan screamed. “Please! My children.”\n“I made a mistake years ago,” Dalinar said. “I will not be so foolish\nagain.”\nAnd yet … those screams.\nDalinar’s soldiers seized Tanalan tightly as Dalinar turned from the man\nand walked back to the pit of fire. Sadeas had just arrived with a company\nof his own men, but Dalinar ignored them, Oathbringer still held against his\nshoulder. Smoke stung Dalinar’s nose, his eyes watering. He couldn’t see\nacross the Rift to the rest of his armies; the air warped with heat, colored\nred.\nIt was like looking into Damnation itself.\nDalinar released a long breath, suddenly feeling his exhaustion even\nmore deeply. “It is enough,” he said, turning toward Sadeas. “Let the rest of\nthe people of the city escape out the mouth of the canyon below. We have\nsent our signal.”\n“What?” Sadeas said, hiking over. “Dalinar—”\nA loud series of cracks interrupted him. An entire section of the city\nnearby collapsed into the flames. The palace—and its occupants—crashed\ndown with it, a tempest of sparks and splintering wood.\n“No!” Tanalan shouted. “NO!”\n“Dalinar…” Sadeas said. “I prepared a battalion below, with archers, per\nyour orders.”\n“My orders?”\n“You said to ‘Kill anyone who comes out of the city and leave their\nbodies to rot.’ I had men stationed below; they’ve launched arrows in at the\ncity struts, burned the walkways leading down. This city burns from both\ndirections—from underneath and from above. We can’t stop it now.”\nWood cracked as more sections of city collapsed. The Thrill surged, and\nDalinar pushed it away. “We’ve gone too far.”\n“Nonsense! Our lesson won’t mean much if people can merely walk\naway.” Sadeas glanced toward Tanalan. “Last loose end is this one. We\ndon’t want him getting away again.” He reached for his sword.\n“I’ll do it,” Dalinar said. Though the concept of more death was starting\nto sicken him, he steeled himself. This was the man who had betrayed him.\nDalinar stepped closer. To his credit, Tanalan tried to leap to his feet and\nfight. Several elites shoved the traitor back down to the ground, though\nCaptainlord Kadash himself was just standing at the side of the city, looking\ndown at the destruction. Dalinar could feel that heat, so terrible. It mirrored\na sense within him. The Thrill … incredibly … was not satisfied. Still it\nthirsted. It didn’t seem … didn’t seem it could be satiated.\nTanalan collapsed, blubbering.\n“You should not have betrayed me,” Dalinar whispered, raising\nOathbringer. “At least this time, you didn’t hide in your hole. I don’t know"

I don’t know\nwho you let take cover there, but know they are dead. I took care of that\nwith barrels of fire.”\nTanalan blinked, then started laughing with a frantic, crazed air. “You\ndon’t know? How could you not know? But you killed our messengers. You\npoor fool. You poor, stupid fool.”\nDalinar seized him by the chin, though the man was still held by his\nsoldiers. “What?”\n“She came to us,” Tanalan said. “To plead. How could you have missed\nher? Do you track your own family so poorly? The hole you burned … we\ndon’t hide there anymore. Everyone knows about it. Now it’s a prison.”\nIce washed through Dalinar, and he grabbed Tanalan by the throat and\nheld, Oathbringer slipping from his fingers. He strangled the man, all the\nwhile demanding that he retract what he’d said.\nTanalan died with a smile on his lips. Dalinar stepped back, suddenly\nfeeling too weak to stand. Where was the Thrill to bolster him? “Go back,”\nhe shouted at his elites. “Search that hole. Go…” He trailed off.\nKadash was on his knees, looking woozy, a pile of vomit on the rock\nbefore him. Some elites ran to try to do as Dalinar said, but they shied away\nfrom the Rift—the heat rising from the burning city was incredible.\nDalinar roared, standing, pushing toward the flames. However, the fire\nwas too intense. Where he had once seen himself as an unstoppable force,\nhe now had to admit exactly how small he was. Insignificant. Meaningless.\nOnce it’s gone feral, you can’t just whistle it back to you.\nHe fell to his knees, and remained there until his soldiers pulled him—\nlimp—away from the heat and carried him to his camp.\n* * *\nSix hours later, Dalinar stood with hands clasped behind his back—partially\nto hide how badly they were shaking—and stared at a body on the table,\ncovered in a white sheet.\nBehind him in the tent, some of his scribes whispered. A sound like\nswishing swords on the practice field. Teleb’s wife, Kalami, led the\ndiscussion; she thought that Evi must have defected. What else could\nexplain why the burned corpse of a highprince’s wife had been found in an\nenemy safehouse?\nIt fit the narrative. Showing uncharacteristic determination, Evi had\ndrugged the guard protecting her. She’d snuck away in the night. The\nscribes wondered how long Evi had been a traitor, and if she’d helped\nrecruit the group of scouts who had betrayed Dalinar.\nHe stepped forward, resting his fingers on the smooth, too-white sheet.\nFool woman. The scribes didn’t know Evi well enough. She hadn’t been a\ntraitor—she’d gone to the Rift to plead for them to surrender. She’d seen in\nDalinar’s eyes that he wouldn’t spare them. So, Almighty help her, she’d\ngone to do what she could.\nDalinar barely had the strength to stand. The Thrill had abandoned him,"

The Thrill had abandoned him,\nand that left him broken, pained.\nHe pulled back the corner of the sheet. The left side of Evi’s face was\nscorched, nauseating, but the right side had been down toward the stone. It\nwas oddly untouched.\nThis is your fault, he thought at her. How dare you do this? Stupid,\nfrustrating woman.\nThis was not his fault, not his responsibility.\n“Dalinar,” Kalami said, stepping up. “You should rest.”\n“She didn’t betray us,” Dalinar said firmly.\n“I’m sure eventually we’ll know what—”\n“She did not betray us,” Dalinar snapped. “Keep the discovery of her\nbody quiet, Kalami. Tell the people … tell them my wife was slain by an\nassassin last night. I will swear the few elites who know to secrecy. Let\neveryone think she died a hero, and that the destruction of the city today\nwas done in retribution.”\nDalinar set his jaw. Earlier today, the soldiers of his army—so carefully\ntrained over the years to resist pillaging and the slaughter of civilians—had\nburned a city to the ground. It would ease their consciences to think that\nfirst, the highlady had been murdered.\nKalami smiled at him, a knowing—even self-important—smile. His lie\nwould serve a second purpose. As long as Kalami and the head scribes\nthought they knew a secret, they’d be less likely to dig for the true answer.\nNot my fault.\n“Rest, Dalinar,” Kalami said. “You are in pain now, but as the highstorm\nmust pass, all mortal agonies will fade.”\nDalinar left the corpse to the ministrations of others. As he departed, he\nstrangely heard the screams of those people in the Rift. He stopped,\nwondering what it was. Nobody else seemed to notice.\nYes, that was distant screaming. In his head, maybe? They all seemed\nchildren to his ears. The ones he’d abandoned to the flames. A chorus of the\ninnocent pleading for help, for mercy.\nEvi’s voice joined them.\n77.

The\nparsh, as they are now called, continue their war with zeal, even\nwithout their masters from Damnation.\n—From drawer 30-20, first emerald\nKaladin dashed across the street. “Wait!” he shouted. “One more here!”\nAhead, a man with a thin mustache struggled to close a thick wooden\ndoor. It stuck partway open, however, giving just enough time for Kaladin\nto slip through.\nThe man swore at him, then pulled the door shut. Made of dark\nstumpweight wood, it made a muffled thunk. The man did up the locks, then\nstepped back and let three younger men place a thick bar into the settings.\n“Cutting that close, armsman,” the mustachioed man said, noting the\nWall Guard patch on Kaladin’s shoulder.\n“Sorry,” Kaladin said, handing the man a few spheres as a cover charge.\n“But the storm is still a few minutes away.”"

Kaladin doubted it had\nbeen luck; sticking people’s shoes to the stone was a classic windspren\ntrick. Still, he did understand the doorman’s hesitance. Everstorms didn’t\nquite match up with scholarly projections. The previous one had arrived\nhours earlier than anyone had guessed it would. Fortunately, they tended to\nblow in slower than highstorms. If you knew to watch the sky, there was\ntime to find shelter.\nKaladin ran his hand through his hair and started deeper into the\nwinehouse. This was one of those fashionable places that—while\ntechnically a stormshelter—was used only by rich people who had come to\nspend the storm enjoying themselves. It had a large common room and\nthick walls of stone blocks. No windows, of course. A bartender kept people\nliquored near the back, and a number of booths ringed the perimeter.\nHe spotted Shallan and Adolin sitting in a booth at the side. She wore her\nown face, but Adolin looked like Meleran Khal, a tall, bald man around\nAdolin’s height. Kaladin lingered, watching Shallan laugh at something\nAdolin said, then poke him—with her safehand—in the shoulder. She\nseemed completely enthralled by him. And good for her. Everyone deserved\nsomething to give them light, these days. But … what about the glances she\nshot him on occasion, times when she didn’t quite seem to be the same\nperson? A different smile, an almost wicked look to her eyes …\nYou’re seeing things, he thought to himself. He strode forward and\ncaught their attention, settling into the booth with a sigh. He was off duty,\nand free to visit the city. He’d told the others he’d find his own shelter for\nthe storm, and only had to be back in time for evening post-storm patrol.\n“Took you long enough, bridgeboy,” Adolin said.\n“Lost track of time,” Kaladin said, tapping the table. He hated being in\nstormshelters. They felt too much like prisons.\nOutside, thunder announced the Everstorm’s arrival. Most people in the\ncity would be inside their homes, the refugees instead in public\nstormshelters.\nThis for-pay shelter was sparsely occupied, only a few of the tables or\nbooths in use. That would give privacy to talk, fortunately, but it didn’t\nbode well for the proprietor. People didn’t have spheres to waste.\n“Where’s Elhokar?” Kaladin asked.\n“Elhokar is working on last-minute plans through the storm,” Adolin\nsaid. “He’s decided to reveal himself tonight to the lighteyes he’s chosen.\nAnd … he’s done a good job, Kal. We’ll at least have some troops because\nof this. Fewer than I’d like, but something.”\n“And maybe another Knight Radiant?” Shallan asked, glancing at\nKaladin. “What have you found?”\nHe quickly caught them up on what he’d learned: The Wall Guard might"

It had\nseized emerald stores in the city—a fact he’d recently discovered.\n“Azure is … tough to read,” Kaladin finished. “She visits the barracks\nevery night, but never talks about herself. Men report seeing her sword cut\nthrough stone, but it has no gemstone. I think it might be an Honorblade,\nlike the weapon of the Assassin in White.”\n“Huh,” Adolin said, sitting back. “You know, that would explain a lot.”\n“My platoon has dinner with her tonight, after evening patrol,” Kaladin\nsaid. “I intend to see what I can learn.”\nA serving girl came for orders, and Adolin bought them wine. He knew\nabout lighteyed drinks and—without needing to be told—ordered\nsomething without a touch of alcohol for Kaladin. He’d be on duty later.\nAdolin did get Shallan a cup of violet, to Kaladin’s surprise.\nAs the serving girl left with the order, Adolin reached out toward\nKaladin. “Let me see your sword.”\n“My sword?” Kaladin said, glancing toward Syl, who was huddling near\nthe back of the booth and humming softly to herself. A way of ignoring the\nsounds of the Everstorm, which rumbled beyond the stones.\n“Not that sword,” Adolin said. “Your side sword.”\nKaladin glanced down to where the sword stuck out beside his seat. He’d\nalmost forgotten he was wearing the thing, which was a relief. The first few\ndays, he’d bumped the sheath into everything. He unbuckled it and set it on\nthe table for Adolin.\n“Good blade,” the prince said. “Well maintained. It was in this condition\nwhen they assigned it to you?”\nKaladin nodded. Adolin drew it and held it up.\n“It’s a little small,” Shallan noted.\n“It’s a one-handed sword, Shallan. Close-range infantry weapon. A\nlonger blade would be impractical.”\n“Longer … like Shardblades?” Kaladin asked.\n“Well, yes, they break all kinds of rules.” Adolin waved the sword\nthrough a few motions, then sheathed it. “I like this highmarshal of yours.”\n“It’s not even her weapon,” Kaladin said, taking it back.\n“You boys done comparing your swords?” Shallan asked. “Because I’ve\nfound something.” She thumped a large book onto the table. “One of my\ncontacts finally tracked down a copy of Hessi’s Mythica. It’s a newer book,\nand has been poorly received. It attributes distinct personalities to the\nUnmade.”\nAdolin lifted the cover, peeking in. “So … anything about swords in it?”\n“Oh hush,” she said, and batted his arm in a playful—and somewhat\nnauseating—way.\nYes, it was uncomfortable to watch the two of them. Kaladin liked them\nboth … just not together. He forced himself to look around the room, which\nwas occupied by lighteyes trying to drink away the sounds of the storm.

He\ntried not to think of refugees who would be packed into stuffy public\nshelters, clutching their meager possessions and hoping some of what they\nwere forced to leave behind would survive the storm.\n“The book,” Shallan said, “claims there were nine Unmade. That\nmatches the vision Dalinar saw, though other reports speak of ten Unmade.\nThey’re likely ancient spren, primal, from the days before human society\nand civilization.\n“The book claims the nine rampaged during the Desolations, but says not\nall were destroyed at Aharietiam. The author insists that some are active\ntoday; I find her vindicated—obviously—by what we’ve experienced.”\n“And there’s one of these in the city,” Adolin said.\n“I think…” Shallan said. “I think there might be two, Adolin. Sja-anat,\nthe Taker of Secrets, is one. Again, Dalinar’s visions mention her. Sja-anat’s\ntouch corrupted other spren—and we’re seeing the effects of that here.”\n“And the other one?” Adolin asked.\n“Ashertmarn,” Shallan said softly. She slipped a little knife from her\nsatchel and began to absently carve at the top of the table. “The Heart of the\nRevel. The book has less to say on him, though it speaks of how he leads\npeople to indulge in excess.”\n“Two Unmade,” Kaladin said. “Are you sure?”\n“Sure as I can be. Wit confirmed the second, and the way the queen acted\nleading up to the riots seems an obvious sign. As for the Taker of Secrets,\nwe can see the corrupted spren ourselves.”\n“How do we fight two?” Kaladin asked.\n“How do we fight one?” Adolin said. “In the tower, we didn’t so much\nfight the thing as frighten it off. Shallan can’t even say how she did that.\nWhat does the book say about fighting them?”\n“Nothing.” Shallan shrugged, blowing at her little carving on the table. It\nwas of a corrupted gloryspren in the shape of a cube, which another patron\nhad attracted. “The book says if you see a spren the wrong color, you’re\nsupposed to immediately move to another town.”\n“There’s kind of an army in the way,” Kaladin said.\n“Yes, amazingly your stench hasn’t cleared them out yet.” Shallan\nstarted leafing through her book.\nKaladin frowned. Comments like that were part of what confused him\nabout Shallan. She seemed perfectly friendly one moment, then she’d snap\nat him the next, while pretending it was merely part of normal conversation.\nBut she didn’t talk like that to others, not even in jest.\nWhat is wrong with you, woman? he thought. They’d shared something\nintimate, in the chasms back on the Shattered Plains. A highstorm huddled\ntogether, and words. Was she embarrassed by that? Was that the reason she\nsnapped at him sometimes?\nIf that was so, how did one explain the other times, when she watched\nhim and grinned?

When she winked, in a sly way?\n“Hessi reports stories of the Unmade not only corrupting spren, but\ncorrupting people,” Shallan was saying. “Maybe that’s what’s happening\nwith the palace. We’ll know more after infiltrating the cult tonight.”\n“I don’t like you going alone,” Adolin said.\n“I won’t be alone. I’ll have my team.”\n“One washwoman and two deserters,” Kaladin said. “If Gaz is anything\nto judge by, Shallan, you shouldn’t put too much trust in those men.”\nShallan raised her chin. “At least my soldiers knew when to get away\nfrom the warcamps, as opposed to just standing around letting people fling\narrows at them.”\n“We trust you, Shallan,” Adolin said, eyeing Kaladin as if to say, Drop it.\n“And we really need a look at that Oathgate.”\n“What if I can’t open it?” Shallan asked. “What then?”\n“We have to retreat back to the Shattered Plains,” Kaladin said.\n“Elhokar won’t leave his family.”\n“Then Drehy, Skar, and I rush the palace,” Kaladin said. “We fly in at\nnight, enter through the upper balcony, grab the queen and the young\nprince. We do it all right before the highstorm comes, then the lot of us fly\nback to Urithiru.”\n“And leave the city to fall,” Adolin said, drawing his lips to a line.\n“Can the city hold?” Shallan asked. “Maybe until we can get back with a\nreal army, marched out here?”\n“That would take months,” Adolin said. “And the Wall Guard is …\nwhat? Four battalions?”\n“Five in total,” Kaladin said.\n“Five thousand men?” Shallan asked. “So few?”\n“That’s large for a city garrison,” Adolin said. “The point of fortifications\nis to let a small number hold against a much larger force. But the enemy has\nan unexpected advantage. Voidbringers who can fly, and a city infested with\ntheir allies.”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said. “The Wall Guard is earnest, but they won’t be able\nto withstand a dedicated assault. There are tens of thousands of parshmen\nout there—and they’re close to attacking. We don’t have much time left.\nThe Fused will sweep in to secure portions of the wall, and their armies will\nfollow. If we’re going to hold this city, we’ll need Radiants and\nShardbearers to even the odds.”\nKaladin and Shallan shared a look. Their Radiants were not a battle-\nready group, not yet. Storms. His men had barely taken to the skies. How\ncould they be expected to fight those creatures who flew so easily upon the\nwinds? How could he protect this city and protect his men?\nThey fell silent, listening to the room shake with the sounds of thunder\noutside. Kaladin finished his drink, wishing it were one of Rock’s\nconcoctions instead, and flicked away an odd cremling that he spotted\nclinging to the side of the bench.

Even with the stresses to the city, the proprietor could at\nleast keep this place clean.\n* * *\nOnce the storm finally blew itself out, Shallan stepped from the winehouse,\nholding Adolin’s arm. She watched Kaladin hurry off toward the barracks\nfor evening patrol.\nShe should probably be equally eager to get going. She still had to steal\nsome food today—enough to satisfy the Cult of Moments when she\napproached them later in the evening. That should be easy enough. Vathah\nhad taken to planning operations under Ishnah’s guidance, and was proving\nquite proficient.\nStill, she lingered, enjoying Adolin’s presence. She wanted to be here,\nwith him, before it was time to be Veil. She … well, she didn’t much care\nfor him. Too clean-cut, too oblivious, too expected. She was fine with him\nas an ally, but wasn’t the least bit interested romantically.\nShallan held his arm, walking with him. People already moved through\nthe city, cleaning up—more so they could scavenge than out of civic duty.\nThey reminded her of cremlings that emerged after a storm to feast on the\nplants. Indeed, nearby, ornamental rockbuds spat out vines in clusters\nbeside doorways. A splatter of green vines and unfurling leaves, set against\nthe brown city canvas.\nOne patch nearby had been struck—and burned away—by the\nEverstorm’s red lightning.\n“I need to show you the Impossible Falls sometime,” Adolin said. “If\nyou watch them from the right angles, it looks like the water is flowing\ndown along the tiers, then somehow right up onto the top again.…”\nAs they walked, she had to step over a dead mink sticking half out of a\nbroken tree trunk. Not the most romantic of strolls, but it was good to hold\non to Adolin’s arm—even if he had to wear a false face.\n“Hey!” Adolin said. “I didn’t get to look through the sketchbook. You\nsaid you were going to show me.”\n“I brought the wrong one, remember? I had to carve on the table.” She\ngrinned. “Don’t think I missed you going up and paying for the damage\nwhen I wasn’t looking.”\nHe grunted.\n“People carve on bar tables. It happens all the time.”\n“Sure, sure. It was a good carving too.”\n“And you still think I shouldn’t have done it.” She squeezed his arm.\n“Oh, Adolin Kholin. You are your father’s son. I won’t do it again, all\nright?”\nHe was blushing. “I,” he said, “was promised sketches. I don’t care if it’s\nthe wrong sketchbook. I feel like I haven’t seen any of your pictures for\nages.”\n“There’s nothing good in this one,” she said, digging in her satchel. “I’ve\nbeen distracted lately.”\nHe still made her hand it over, and secretly she was pleased.

A young woman,\nlighteyed and hanging out a window, hair drifting free, wearing only a\nnightgown with her hand tied in a pouch.\n“Shallan,” he said, “these are amazing!

It was\na picture of him in one of his new suits.\nShallan blushed. “Forgot that was there,” she said, trying to get the\nsketchbook back. He lingered on the picture, then finally succumbed to her\nprodding and handed it back. She let out a sigh of relief. It wasn’t that she’d\nbe embarrassed if he saw the sketch of Kaladin on the next page—she did\nsketches of all kinds of people. But best to end on the picture of Adolin.\nVeil had been seeping through on that other one.\n“You’re getting better, if that’s possible.”\n“Maybe. Though I don’t know how much I can credit myself with the\nprogress. Words of Radiance says that a lot of Lightweavers were artists.”\n“So the order recruited people like you.”\n“Or the Surgebinding made them better at sketching, giving them an\nunfair advantage over other artists.”\n“I have an unfair advantage over other duelists. I have had the finest\ntraining since childhood. I was born strong and healthy, and my father’s\nwealth gave me some of the best sparring partners in the world. My build\ngives me reach over other men. Does that mean I don’t deserve accolades\nwhen I win?”\n“You don’t have supernatural help.”\n“You still had to work hard. I know you did.” He put his arm around her,\npulling her closer as they walked. Other Alethi couples kept their distance\nin public, but Adolin had been raised by a mother with a fondness for hugs.\n“You know, there’s this thing my father complains about. He asked what the\nuse of Shardblades was.”\n“Um … I think they’re pretty obviously for cutting people up. Without\ncutting them, actually. So—”\n“But why only swords? Father asks why the ancient Radiants never\nmade tools for the people.” He squeezed her shoulder. “I love that your\npowers make you a better artist, Shallan. Father was wrong. The Radiants\nweren’t just soldiers! Yes, they created incredible weapons, but they also\ncreated incredible art! And maybe once this war is done, we can find other\nuses for their powers.”\nStorms, his enthusiasm could be intoxicating. As they walked toward the\ntailor’s shop, she was loath to part with him, though Veil did need to get on\nwith her day’s work.\nI can be anyone, Shallan thought, noticing a few joyspren blowing past,\nlike a swirl of blue leaves.

Then she reached up and kissed him on the cheek.\n“Thank you for being you, Adolin.”\n“Everyone else was taken already,” he mumbled.\nNever stopped me.\nHe watched her until she ducked around a corner, heart thumping.\nAdolin Kholin in her life was like a warm sunrise.\nVeil started to seep out, and she was forced to acknowledge that\nsometimes she preferred the storm and the rain to the sun.\nShe checked at the drop point, inside a corner of a building that was now\nrubble. Here, Red had deposited a pack that contained Veil’s outfit. She\ngrabbed it and went hunting a good place to change.\nThe end of the world had come, but that seemed most true after a storm.\nRefuse strewn about, people who hadn’t gotten to shelters moaning from\nfallen shacks or alongside streets.\nIt was like each storm tried to wipe them off Roshar, and they only\nremained through sheer grit and luck. Now, with two storms, it was even\nworse. If they defeated the Voidbringers, would the Everstorm remain? Had\nit begun to erode their society in a way that—win the war or not—would\neventually end with them all swept out to sea?\nShe felt her face changing as she walked, draining Stormlight from her\nsatchel. It rose in her like a flaring flame, before dimming to an ember as\nshe became the people from the sketches Adolin had seen.\nThe poor man who tried doggedly to keep the area around his little pallet\nclean, as if to try to maintain some control over an insane world.\nThe lighteyed girl who wondered what had happened to the joy of\nadolescence. Instead of her wearing her first havah to a ball, her family was\nforced to take in dozens of relatives from neighboring towns, and she spent\nthe days locked away because the streets weren’t safe.\nThe mother with a child, sitting in darkness, looking toward the horizon\nand a hidden sun.\nFace after face. Life after life. Overpowering, intoxicating, alive.\nBreathing, and crying, and laughing, and being. So many hopes, so many\nlives, so many dreams."

So many hopes, so many\nlives, so many dreams.\nShe unbuttoned her havah up the side, then let it fall. She dropped her\nsatchel, which thumped from the heavy book inside. She stepped forward in\nonly her shift, safehand uncovered, feeling the wind on her skin. She was\nstill wearing an illusion, one that didn’t disrobe, so nobody could see her.\nNobody could see her. Had anyone ever seen her? She stopped on the\nstreet corner, wearing shifting faces and clothing, enjoying the sensation of\nfreedom, clothed yet naked skin shivering at the wind’s kiss.\nAround her, people ducked away into buildings, frightened.\nJust another spren, Shallan/Veil/Radiant thought. That’s what I am.\nEmotion made carnal.\nShe lifted her hands to the sides, exposed, yet invisible. She breathed the\nbreaths of a city’s people.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said, unweaving himself from her discarded dress.\n“Shallan?”\n“Maybe,” she said, lingering.\nFinally, she let herself slip fully into Veil’s persona. She immediately\nshook her head and fetched the clothing and satchel. She was lucky it hadn’t\nbeen stolen. Foolish girl. They didn’t have time for prancing around from\npoem to poem.\nVeil found a secluded location beside a large gnarled tree whose roots\nspread all the way along the wall in either direction. She quickly rearranged\nher underclothing, then put on her trousers and did up her shirt. She pulled\non her hat, checked herself in a hand mirror, then nodded.\nRight, then. Time to meet up with Vathah.\nHe was waiting at the inn where Wit had once stayed. Radiant retained\nhope that she’d meet him again there, for a more thorough interrogation. In\nthe private room, away from the eyes of the fretting innkeeper, Vathah laid\nout a couple of spheres to light the maps he’d purchased. They detailed the\nmanor she intended to hit this afternoon.\n“They call it the Mausoleum,” Vathah explained as Veil sat. He showed\nher an artist’s sketch he’d purchased, which was of the building’s grand\nhall. “Those statues are all Soulcast, by the way. They’re favored servants\nof the house, turned to storming stone.”\n“It’s a sign of honor and respect among lighteyes.”\n“It’s creepy,” Vathah said. “When I die, burn my corpse up right good.\nDon’t leave me staring for eternity while your descendants sip their tea.”\nVeil nodded absently, placing Shallan’s sketchbook on the table. “Pick an\nalias from this. This map says the larder is on the outside wall. Time is tight,\nso we might want to do this one the easy way. Have Red make a distraction,\nthen use Shallan’s Blade to cut us an opening right in to the food.”\n“You know, they’re said to have quite the fortune at the Mausoleum. The\nTenet family riches are…” He trailed off as he saw her expression. “No\nriches, then.”\n“We get the food to pay the cult, then we get out.”"

We stole mostly food back then too, Brightness. Just\nwanted to stay alive and forget.”\n“And do you still want to forget?”\nHe grunted. “No, suppose I don’t. Suppose I sleep a little better now at\nnight, don’t I?”\nThe door opened and the innkeeper bustled in, holding drinks. Vathah\nyelped, though Veil turned with a droll expression. “I believe,” she said, “I\nwanted to not be interrupted.”\n“I brought drinks!”\n“Which is an interruption,” Veil said, pointing out the door. “If we’re\nthirsty, we’ll ask.”\nThe innkeeper grumbled, then backed out the door, carrying his tray.\nHe’s suspicious, Veil thought. He thinks we were up to something with Wit,\nand wants to find out what.\n“Time to move these meetings to another location, eh, Vathah?” She\nlooked back at the table.\nAnd found someone else sitting there.\nVathah was gone, replaced by a bald man with thick knuckles and a well-\nkept smock. Shallan glanced at the picture on the table, then at the drained\nsphere beside it, then back at Vathah.\n“Nice,” she said. “But you forgot to do the back of the head, the part not\nin the drawing.”\n“What?” Vathah asked, frowning.\nShe showed him the hand mirror.\n“Why’d you put his face on me?”\n“I didn’t,” Veil said, standing. “You panicked and this happened.”\nVathah prodded at his face, still looking in the mirror, confused.\n“I’ll bet the first few times are always accidents,” Veil said. She tucked\nthe mirror away. “Gather this stuff up. We’ll do the mission as planned, but\ntomorrow you’re relieved of infiltration duty. I’ll want you practicing with\nyour Stormlight instead.”\n“Practicing…” He finally seemed to get it, his brown eyes opening\nwidely. “Brightness! I’m no storming Radiant.”\n“Of course not. You’re probably a squire—I think most orders had them.\nYou might become something more. I think Shallan was making illusions\noff and on for years before she said the oaths. But then, it’s all kind of\nmuddled in her head. I had my sword when I was very young, and…”\nShe took a deep breath. Fortunately, Veil hadn’t lived through those days.\nPattern hummed in warning.\n“Brightness…” Vathah said. “Veil, you really think that I…”\nStorms, he seemed like he was going to cry.\nShe patted him on the shoulder. “We don’t have time to waste.

She nestled in the\nback, against a bag of grain, feet up on a paper-wrapped haunch of cured\npork.\n“Swiftspren” was Veil, as she was the one who had been seen\ndistributing the food. Therefore, to enter this revel, she would have to go as\nherself.\nThe enemy knew what she looked like. Should she have created a new\npersona, a false face, to not expose Veil?\nBut Veil is a false face, a part of her said. You could always abandon her.\nShe strangled that part of her, smothered it deep. Veil was too real, too\nvital, to abandon. Shallan would be easier.\nFirst moon was up by the time they reached the steps to the Oathgate\nplatform. Vathah rolled the wagon into place, and Veil hopped off, coat\nrippling around her. Two guards here were dressed as flamespren, with\ngolden and red tassels. Their muscular builds, and those two spears set near\nthe steps, hinted these men might have been soldiers before joining the cult.\nA woman bustled between them, wearing a flat white mask with\neyeholes but no mouth or other features. Veil narrowed her eyes; the mask\nreminded her of Iyatil, Mraize’s master in the Ghostbloods. But it was a\nvery different shape.\n“You were told to come alone, Swiftspren,” the woman said.\n“You expected me to unload all of this on my own?” Veil waved to the\nback of the wagon.\n“We can handle it,” the woman said smoothly, stepping over as one of\nthe guards held up a torch—not a sphere lamp—and the other lowered the\nwagon’s tailgate. “Mmmm…”\nVeil turned sharply. That hum …\nThe guards started unloading the food.\n“You can take all but the two bags marked with red,” Veil said, pointing.\n“I need those for my rounds visiting the poor.”\n“I wasn’t aware this was a negotiation,” the cultist said. “You asked for\nthis. You’ve been leaving whispers through the city that you want to join the\nrevel.”\nWit’s work, apparently. She’d have to thank him.\n“Why are you here?” the cultist asked, sounding curious. “What is it you\nwant, Swiftspren, so-called hero of the markets?”\n“I just … keep hearing this voice. It says that this is the end, that I should\ngive in to it. Embrace the time of spren.” She turned toward the Oathgate"

Embrace the time of spren.” She turned toward the Oathgate\nplatform; an orange glow was rising from the top. “The answers are up\nthere, aren’t they?”\nFrom the corner of her eye, she saw the three nod to one another. She’d\npassed some kind of test.\n“You may climb the steps to enlightenment,” the cultist in white told her.\n“Your guide will meet you at the top.”\nShe tossed her hat to Vathah and met his eyes. Once the unloading was\nthrough, he’d pull away and set up a few streets farther off, where he could\nwatch the edge of the Oathgate platform. If she had trouble, she would\nthrow herself off, counting on Stormlight to heal her after falling.\nShe started up the steps.\n* * *\nKaladin normally liked the feeling of the city after a storm. Clean and fresh,\nwashed of grime and refuse.\nHe’d done evening patrol, checking over their beat to see everything was\nall right following the storm. Now he stood on the top of the wall, waiting\nfor the rest of his squad, who were still stowing their equipment. The sun\nhad barely set, and it was time for dinner.\nBelow, he picked out buildings newly scarred from lightning strikes. A\npod of corrupted windspren danced past, trailing intense red light. Even the\nsmell of the air was wrong somehow. Moldy and sodden.\nSyl sat quietly on his shoulder until Beard and the others piled into the\nstairwell. He finally joined them, walking down below to the barrack, where\nboth platoons—his and the one they shared the space with—were gathering\nfor dinner. Roughly twenty of the men from the other platoon would be on\nwall duty tonight, but everyone else was present.\nNot long after Kaladin arrived, the two platoon captains called their men\nto muster. Kaladin fell into line between Beard and Ved, and together they\nsaluted as Azure stepped into the doorway. She was arrayed for battle as\nalways, with her breastplate, chain, and cloak.\nTonight, she decided to do a formal inspection. Kaladin held attention\nwith the others as she walked down their lines and commented quietly to\nthe two captains. She looked over a few swords, and asked several of the\nmen if they needed anything. Kaladin felt as if he’d stood in similar lines a\nhundred times, sweating and hoping that the general would find everything\nin order.\nThey always did. This wasn’t the type of inspection that was intended to\nactually find problems—this was a chance for the men to show off for their\nhighmarshal. They swelled as she told them they “just might be the finest\nplatoons of fighting men I’ve ever had the privilege of leading.” Kaladin\nwas certain he’d heard those exact words from Amaram.\nTrite or not, the words inspired the men. They gave the highmarshal\nshouts of approval once they were given leave to break ranks. Perhaps the\nnumber of “finest platoons” in the army went up during times of war, when\neveryone craved a morale boost.\nKaladin walked to the officers’ table.

Noro really wanted him\npromoted to lieutenant, and most of the others were too intimidated by\nAzure to sit at her table.\nThe highmarshal hung her cloak and strange sword on a peg. She kept\nher gloves on, and though he couldn’t see her chest because of the\nbreastplate, that face and build were obviously female. She was also very\nAlethi, with the skin tone and hair, her eyes a glimmering light orange.\nShe must have spent time as a mercenary out west, Kaladin thought.\nSigzil had once told him that women fought in the west, particularly among\nmercenaries.\nThe meal was simple curried grain. Kaladin took a bite, well acquainted\nby now with the aftertaste of Soulcast grain. A lingering staleness. The\ncurry helped, but the cooks had used the boiled-off starch of the grain to\nthicken it, so it had some of the same flavor.\nHe’d been placed relatively far from the center of the table, where Azure\nconversed with the two platoon captains. Eventually, one excused himself to\nuse the privy.\nKaladin thought for a moment, then picked up his plate and moved down\nthe table to settle into the open spot.\n* * *\nVeil reached the top of the platform, entering what felt like a little village.\nThe monastery structures here were much smaller—yet far nicer—than the\nones on the Shattered Plains had been. A cluster of fine stonework structures\nwith slanted, wedge-shaped roofs, the points toward the Origin.\nOrnamental shalebark grew around the bases of most of the buildings,\ncultivated and carved into swirling patterns. Veil took a Memory for\nShallan, but her focus was on the firelight coming from farther inward. She\ncouldn’t see the control building. All of these other structures were in the\nway. She could see the palace off to her left, glowing in the night with\nwindows lit. It connected to the Oathgate platform by a covered walkway\ncalled the Sunwalk. A small group of soldiers, visible in the darkness only\nas shadows, guarded the way across.\nClose to her—at the top of the steps—a rotund man sat along a shalebark\nridge. He had short hair and light green eyes, and gave her an affable grin.\n“Welcome! I’m your guide tonight, for your first time at the revel! It can\nbe … ah, disorienting.”\nThose are ardent robes, Veil noted. Ripped, stained from what appeared\nto be a variety of foods.\n“Everyone who comes up here,” he said, hopping off his seat, “is reborn.\nYour name is now … um…” He pulled a piece of paper from his pocket.\n“Where did I write that? Well, suppose it isn’t important. Your name is\nKishi. Doesn’t that sound nice? Good job getting up here. This is where\nyou’ll find the real fun in the city.”\nHe shoved his hands back in his pockets and looked down one of the\nroadways, then his shoulders slumped. “Anyway,” he said. “Let’s get going.\nLots of reveling to do tonight. Always so much reveling to be done…”\n“And you are?”"

Oh, um, Kharat is what they named me. I think? I forget.” He\nambled forward without waiting to see if she followed.\nShe did, eager to get to the center. However, just past the first building,\nshe reached the revel—and had to stop to take it in. A bonfire burned right\non the ground, flames crackling and whipping in the wind, bathing Veil in\nheat. Corrupted flamespren, vivid blue and somehow more jagged, danced\ninside of it. Tables lined the walkway here, piled with food. Candied meats,\nstacks of flatbread crusted with sugar, fruits and pastries.\nA variety of people passed by, occasionally scooping food off the tables\nwith their bare hands. They laughed and shouted. Many had been ardents,\nmarked by brown robes. Others were lighteyes, though their clothing had …\ndecayed? It seemed a fitting word for these suits with missing jackets,\nhavah dresses whose skirts were ragged from brushing the ground.\nSafehand sleeves ripped off at the shoulder and discarded somewhere.\nThey moved like fish in a school, flowing from right to left. She picked\nout soldiers, both lighteyed and dark, in the remnants of uniforms. They\nseemed to take no note of her or Kharat standing to the side.\nShe’d have to cut through the stream of people to get farther inward to\nthe Oathgate control building. She started to do so, but Kharat took her by\nthe arm, steering her to join the flow of people.\n“We have to stay to the outer ring,” he said. “No going inward for us,\nnope. Be happy. You get … you get to enjoy the end of the world in\nstyle.…”\nShe reluctantly let herself be pulled along. It was probably best to do a\nround of the platform anyway. However, not long after starting, she began\nto hear the voice.\nLet go.\nGive up your pain.\nFeast. Indulge.\nEmbrace the end.\nPattern hummed on her coat, his sound lost to the many people laughing\nand drinking. Kharat stuck his fingers into some kind of creamy dessert,\ntaking it by the handful. His eyes had glazed over, and he muttered to\nhimself as he pushed the food into his mouth. Though others laughed and\neven danced, most showed that same glassy look.\nShe could feel Pattern’s vibrations on her coat. It seemed to counteract\nthe voices, clearing her head. Kharat handed her a cup of wine he’d scooped\nfrom a table. Who set this all up? Where were the servants?\nThere was just so much food. Tables and tables of it. People moved in\nbuildings they passed, engaging in other carnal delights. Veil tried to slip\nacross the stream of revelers, but Kharat kept hold of her.\n“Everyone wants to go inward their first time,” he said. “You aren’t\nallowed. Enjoy this. Enjoy the feeling. It’s not our fault, right? We didn’t\nfail her. We were only doing what she asked. Don’t cause a storm, girl.\nNobody wants that.…”"

So instead she waited until they passed\nanother building, and tugged him that way.\n“Going to find a partner?” he asked, numb. “Sure. That’s allowed.\nAssuming you can find anyone still sober enough to care…”\nThey entered the building, which had once been a place for meditation,\nfilled with individual rooms. It smelled sharply of incense, and each alcove\nhad its own brazier for burning prayers. Those were now occupied for\nanother sort of experience.\n“I just want to rest a moment,” she told Kharat, peeking into an empty\nroom. It had a window. She could slip out that, maybe. “It’s all so\noverwhelming.”\n“Oh.” He looked over his shoulder toward the revel passing outside. His\nleft hand was still coated with sweet paste.\nVeil stepped into the chamber. When he tried to follow, she said, “I need\na moment alone.”\n“I’m supposed to keep watch on you,” he said, and prevented her from\nclosing the door.\n“Then watch,” she said and settled down on the bench inside the cell.\n“From a distance.”\nHe sighed and sat down on the floor of the hallway.\nNow what? A new face, she thought. What did he name me? Kishi. It\nmeant Mystery. She used a Memory she’d drawn earlier in the day, that of a\nwoman from the market. In her mind, Shallan added touches to the clothing.\nA havah, ragged like the others, an exposed safehand.\nIt would do. She wished she could sketch it, but she could make this\nwork. Now, what to do about her guard?\nHe probably hears voices, she thought. I can use that. She pressed her\nhand to Pattern, and wove sound.\n“Go,” she whispered, “hang on the wall of the hallway outside, next to\nhim.”\nPattern softly hummed his reply. She closed her eyes, and could faintly\nhear the words she’d woven to be whispered near Kharat.\nIndulge.\nGet something to drink.\nJoin the revel.\n“You going to just sit there?” Kharat called in to her.\n“Yes.”\n“I’m going to get something to drink. Don’t leave.”\n“Fine.”\nHe rose, then jogged out. By the time he got back, she had attached an\nillusion of Veil to a ruby mark, then left it there. It showed Veil resting on\nthe bench, eyes closed, snoring softly.\nKishi passed Kharat in the hallway, stepping with glassy eyes. He didn’t\nspare her a second glance, and instead settled down in the hallway with a\nlarge cup of wine to watch Veil.\nKishi joined the revel outside. A man there laughed and grabbed at her\nsafehand, as if to pull her toward one of the rooms. Kishi dodged him and\nslipped farther inward, flowing through the stream of people.

Nobody forbade Kishi as she\nleft the flow of the outer ring, stepping between two buildings, heading\ninward.\n* * *\nThe others stopped their small talk, and the officers’ table grew very still as\nKaladin settled down across from Azure.\nThe highmarshal laced her gloved hands before herself. “Kal, was it?”\nshe said. “The lighteyed man with slave brands. How are you finding your\ntime in the Wall Guard?”\n“It’s a well-run army, sir, and strangely welcoming of one such as\nmyself.” He then nodded over the highmarshal’s shoulder. “I’ve never seen\nsomeone treat a Shardblade so casually. You just hang it on a peg?”\nThe others at the table watched with obviously held breaths.\n“I’m not particularly worried about anyone taking her,” Azure said. “I\ntrust these men.”\n“It’s still remarkable,” Kaladin said. “Foolhardy, even.”\nAcross the table, two places down from Azure, Lieutenant Noro raised\nhis hands silently toward Kaladin in a pleading way. Don’t screw this up,\nKal!\nBut Azure smiled. “I never did get an explanation for that shash brand,\nsoldier.”\n“I never gave a proper one, sir,” Kaladin said. “I’m not fond of the\nmemories that earned me the scar.”\n“How did you end up in this city?” Azure asked. “Sadeas’s lands are far\nto the north. There are several armies of Voidbringers between here and\nthere, by report.”\n“I flew. How about you, sir? You couldn’t have been in the city long\nbefore the siege began; nobody talks of you earlier than that time. They say\nyou appeared right when the Guard needed you.”\n“Perhaps I was always here, but merely blended in.”\n“With those scars? They may not spell out danger as explicitly as mine,\nbut they’d have been memorable.”\nThe rest of the table—lieutenants and the platoon captain—stared at\nKaladin slack-jawed. Perhaps he was pushing too hard, acting too far above\nhis station.\nHe’d never been good at acting his station though.\n“Perhaps,” Azure said, “one shouldn’t be questioning my arrival. Be\nthankful someone was here when the city needed them.”\n“I am thankful,” Kaladin said. “Your reputation with these men\ncommends you, Azure, and extreme times can excuse a great deal.\nEventually though, you’ll need to come clean. These men deserve to know\nwho—exactly—is commanding them.”\n“And what about you, Kal?” She took a spoonful of curry and rice—\nmen’s food, which she ate with gusto. “Do they deserve to know your past?\nShouldn’t you come clean?”\n“Perhaps.”\n“I am your commanding officer, you realize. You should answer me\nwhen I ask questions.”\n“I’ve given answers,” Kaladin said. “If they aren’t the ones you want,\nthen perhaps your questions aren’t very good.”\nNoro gasped audibly.\n“And you, Kal? You make statements, dripping with implications. You\nwant answers? Why not just ask?”\nStorms. She was right.

He’d been dancing around serious questions.\nKaladin looked her in the eyes. “Why won’t you let anyone talk about the\nfact that you’re a woman, Azure? Noro, don’t faint. You’ll embarrass us\nall.”\nThe lieutenant thumped his forehead against the table, groaning softly.\nThe captainlord, with whom Kaladin hadn’t interacted much, had gone red-\nfaced.\n“They came up with this game on their own,” Azure said. “They’re\nAlethi, so they need an excuse for why they’re listening to a woman giving\nmilitary orders. Pretending there’s some mystery focuses them on that,\ninstead of on masculine pride. I find the entire thing silly.” She leaned\nforward. “Tell me honestly. Did you come here chasing me?”\nChasing you? Kaladin cocked his head.\nDrums sounded in the near distance.\nIt took a moment for them, even Kaladin, to register what that meant.\nThen Kaladin and Azure threw themselves back from the bench at nearly\nthe same time. “To arms!” Kaladin shouted. “There’s an attack on the wall!”\n* * *\nThe next ring inward on the Oathgate platform was filled with people\ncrawling.\nKishi stood at the perimeter, watching a multitude of men and women in\nragged finery crawl past her, giggling, moaning, or gasping. Each seemed in\nthe thrall of a different emotion, and each stared with an openly maddened\nexpression. She thought she recognized a few from the descriptions of\nlighteyes who had disappeared into the palace, though in their state, it was\nhard to tell.\nA woman with long hair dragging on the ground looked toward her,\ngrinning with clenched teeth and bleeding gums. She crawled, one hand\nafter another, her havah shredded, faded. She was followed by a man\nwearing rings glowing with Stormlight, in contrast to his ripped clothing.\nHe giggled incessantly.\nThe food on the tables here rotted, and was infested with decayspren.\nKishi wavered at the edge of the ring.

Instead of the control building, she found an\novergrown mass. Something had covered the entire structure, like the\nMidnight Mother had enveloped the gemstone pillar beneath Urithiru.\nThe dark mass pulsed and throbbed. Black veins as thick as a man’s leg\nran from it and melded with the ground nearby. A heart. It beat an irregular\nrhythm, bum-ba-ba-bum instead of the common ba-bum of her own\nheartbeat.\nGive in.\nJoin the revel.\nShallan, listen to me.\nShe shook herself. That last voice had been different. She’d heard it\nbefore, hadn’t she?\nShe looked to the side, and found her shadow on the ground, pointed the\nwrong way, toward the moonlight instead of away from it. The shadow\ncrept up the wall, with eyes that were white holes, glowing faintly.\nI’m not your enemy. But the heart is a trap. Take caution.\nDistantly, drums started sounding on the top of the wall. The\nVoidbringers were attacking.\nIt all threatened to overwhelm her. The thumping heart, the strange\nprocessions in rings around it, the drums and the panic that the Fused were\ncoming for her because she’d been seen.\nVeil seized control. She’d accomplished her goal, she’d scouted the area,\nand she had information about the Oathgate. It was time to get out.\nShe turned and—forcibly—put on Kishi’s face. She crossed the stream\nof crawling, moaning people. She flowed back into the outer ring of\nrevelers, before slipping out.\nShe didn’t check on her guide. She walked to the rim of the Oathgate\nplatform and, without a look back, leaped off.\n79.

The soldiers on duty had lit the enormous oil lamps on the tops of the\ntowers, giving light to the dark walls.

Later.\nShe broke left and Kaladin dashed right, shouting for men to form up.\nSyl spun around his head, concerned, anxious. Kaladin scooped a shield off\nthe ground and seized a soldier by the arm, towing him around and locking\nshields. A swooping lance clanged off the metal, sending a jolt through\nKaladin. The Voidbringer flew past.\nPained, Kaladin ignored the wounded and bleeding who crawled with\ncorrupted painspren. He pulled the scattered remnants of the Eighth Platoon\nback together while his own men stumbled to a halt outside the stairwell.\nThese were their friends, the people with whom they shared a barrack.\n“To your right and up!” Syl shouted.\nKaladin set himself and used his shield to push aside the lance of a\nVoidbringer who soared past. A second Voidbringer followed, wearing a\nlong skirt of rippling crimson cloth. The way she flew was almost\nmesmerizing.… Right up until her lance pinned Captain Deedanor against\nthe wall’s battlements, then lifted him and tossed him over.\nHe screamed as he plummeted toward the ground below. Kaladin almost\nbroke rank and ran for him, but held himself in the line by force. He\nreached, by instinct, for the Stormlight in his pouch—but held himself back.\nUsing it for Lashing would attract screamers, and in this darkness, even\ndrawing in a small amount would reveal him for what he was. The Fused\nwould all attack him together; he would risk undermining the mission to\nsave the entire city.\nToday, he protected best through discipline, order, and keeping a level\nhead. “Squads One and Two, with me!” he shouted. “Vardinar, you’ve got\nFive and Six; have your men hand out pikes, then grab bows and get to the\ntower’s top. Noro, take squads Three and Four and set up on the wall walk\njust past the tower. My men will hold here on this side. Go, go!”\nNobody voiced a complaint as they scrambled to do as he said. Kaladin\nheard shouts from the highmarshal farther down the wall, but didn’t have a\nchance to see how she was doing. As his two squads finally got a proper\nshield wall mounted, a human corpse slammed down onto the wall walk\nnearby. It had been dropped from very high up—or perhaps it had been\nLashed into the sky and had only now fallen. Most of the wounded men\nwere archers from the Eighth Platoon; it looked like they’d been swept from\nthe top of the tower.\nWe can’t fight these things, Kaladin thought. The Voidbringers attacked\nin sweeping dives, coming in from all directions. It was impossible to\nmaintain a normal formation beneath that assault.\nSyl shifted into the shape of a girl and looked at him questioningly. He\nshook his head. He could fight without Stormlight. He’d protected people\nlong before he could fly.\nHe started to call out orders, but a Fused passed by, slapping at their\npikes with a large shield.

A violet\nglow steamed from the creature’s body as it swept around with its lance,\nwielding it like an oversized staff.\nKaladin ducked by instinct, trying to maneuver his pike. The Fused\ngrinned as the formation disintegrated. It was male, reminiscent of a\nParshendi, with layered plates of chitin armor creeping down across its\nforehead and rising from cheeks that were marbled black and red.\nKaladin leveled his pike, but the creature lunged along it and pressed its\nhand against Kaladin’s chest. He felt himself grow lighter, but also suddenly\nbegin to fall backward.\nThe creature had Lashed him.\nKaladin fell back, like he was toppling off a ledge, falling along the wall\ntoward a group of his men. The Fused wanted Kaladin to crash into them,\nbut it had made a mistake.\nThe sky was his.\nKaladin responded immediately to the Lashing, and reoriented himself in\nthe blink of an eye. Down became the direction he was falling: along the\nwalkway, toward the towering guard post. His men seemed to be stuck to\nthe side of a cliff, turning toward him, horrified.\nKaladin was able to shove against the stone with the end of his pike,\nmoving him to the side so he whooshed past his men instead of crashing\ninto them. Syl joined him as a ribbon, and he twisted, falling feet-first along\nthe walkway toward the guard tower below.\nHe was able to nudge himself so he fell right into the open doorway. He\ndropped the pike, then caught the lip of the doorway as he passed through it.\nHe stopped with a jarring lurch, arms protesting with pain, but that\nmaneuver slowed him enough. When he swung and let go, he dropped\nthrough the room—past the dining table, which seemed glued to the wall—\nand landed on the opposite wall, inside the building. He stepped over to the\nother doorway, which looked out onto the walk where he’d positioned\nNoro’s squad. Beard and Ved held pikes toward the sky, looking anxious.\n“Kaladin!” Syl said. “Above!”\nHe looked upward and out the doorway he’d come through. The\nVoidbringer who had Lashed him came soaring downward, carrying a lance.\nIt curved to bypass the tower, preparing to whip around and attack Beard\nand the men on the other side.\nKaladin growled and dashed along the inside wall of the tower, pulled\nhimself up past the table, then hurled himself out a window.\nHe crashed into the Voidbringer in midair, shoving the creature’s lance to\nthe side.\n“Leave. My. Men. Alone!”\nKaladin clung to the clothing of the monster, spinning in the air dozens\nof feet above the dark city, sparkling with the light of spheres in windows or\nlanterns. The Voidbringer Lashed them higher, falsely assuming that the\nmore height it had, the more advantage it would gain over Kaladin.\nHolding tightly with his left hand, wind whipping around them, Kaladin\nreached out with his right hand and summoned Syl as a long knife. She\nappeared immediately, and Kaladin shoved the diminutive Shardblade into\nthe creature’s stomach."

Like Radiants. That Voidlight sustains them.\nKaladin still refrained from drawing in his own Stormlight. He suffered\nthe Fused’s Lashings as it spun them in the air, shouting in a language\nKaladin didn’t understand. He tried to maneuver the Shardknife and cut the\nthing’s spine. The weapon was insanely sharp, but for the moment, leverage\nand disorientation were bigger factors.\nThe Voidbringer grunted, then Lashed itself—with Kaladin hanging on\n—back downward toward the wall. They fell quickly, a double or triple\nLashing, spiraling and screaming toward the wall walk.\nKaladin! Syl’s voice, in his head. I sense something … something about\nits power. Cut upward, toward the heart.\nThe city, the battle, the sky—all became a blur.

They\nhit hard, and he bounced off the corpse, then hit the stones with a crack. He\ngroaned, eyes flashing with pain, and was forced—by instinct—to take in a\nbreath of Stormlight to heal the damage of the fall.\nThat Light flowed through him, reknitting bones, repairing organs. It was\nused up in a moment, and he forced himself not to draw in more, instead\npushing himself up and shaking his head.\nThe Voidbringer stared sightlessly from the wall walk beside him. It was\ndead.\nAhead, the other Fused began streaking away in retreat, leaving a broken\nand battered group of guards. Kaladin stumbled to his feet; his section of\nthe wall was empty, save for the dead and the dying. He didn’t recognize\nany; he’d hit the wall some fifty feet away from his platoon’s position.\nSyl landed on his shoulder and patted him on the side of the head.\nPainspren littered the wall, crawling this way and that, in the shape of hands\nwithout skin.\nThis city is doomed, Kaladin thought as he knelt by one of the wounded\nand quickly prepared a bandage by slicing up a fallen cloak. Storms. We\nmight all be doomed. We’re not anywhere near ready to fight these things.\nIt looked like Noro’s squad, at least, had survived. They jogged down the\nwall and gathered around the Voidbringer Kaladin had killed, nudging it\nwith the butts of their pikes. Kaladin tied off a tourniquet, then moved to\nanother man, whose head he wrapped.\nSoon, army surgeons flooded the wall. Kaladin stepped back, bloodied—\nbut more angry than tired.

He turned to Noro, Beard, and the others, who\nhad gathered around him.\n“You killed one,” Beard said, feeling at his arm with the empty\nglyphward. “Storms. You actually killed one, Kal.”\n“How many have you brought down?” Kaladin asked, realizing that he’d\nnever asked. “How many has the Wall Guard killed during the assaults these\nlast weeks?”\nHis men shared glances.\n“Azure drove a few off,” Noro said. “They’re afraid of her Shardblade.\nBut as for Voidbringers killed … this would be the first, Kal.”\nStorms. Even worse, the one he’d killed would be reborn. Unless the\nHeralds set up their prison again, Kaladin couldn’t ever really kill one of the\nFused.\n“I need to talk to Azure,” he said, striding down the wall walk. “Noro,\nreport.”\n“None fallen, sir, though Vaceslv took a gash to the chest. He’s with the\nsurgeons, and should pull through.”\n“Good. Squad, you’re with me.”\nHe found Azure surveying the Eighth Platoon’s losses near their guard\ntower. She had her cloak off and held oddly in one hand, wrapped around\nher forearm, with part of it draping down below. Her unsheathed\nShardblade glittered, long and silvery.\nKaladin stepped up to her, the sleeve of his uniform stained dark with the\nblood of the Voidbringer he’d killed. Azure looked tired, and she gestured\nwith her sword outward. “Have a look.”\nLights lit the horizon. Sphere lights. Thousands upon thousands of them\n—far more than he’d seen on previous nights. They blanketed the\nlandscape.\n“That’s the entire enemy army,” Azure said. “I’d bet my red life on it.\nSomehow, they marched them through that storm earlier today. It won’t be\nlong now. They’ll have to attack before the next highstorm. A few days at\nmost.”\n“I need to know what’s going on here, Azure,” Kaladin said. “How are\nyou getting food for this army?”\nShe drew her lips to a line.\n“He killed one, Highmarshal,” Beard whispered from behind him.\n“Storms … he took one of them down. Grabbed on like he was mounting a\nstorming horse, then rode the bastard through the sky.”\nThe woman studied him, and reluctantly Kaladin summoned Syl as a\nShardblade. Noro’s eyes bulged, and Ved nearly fainted—though Beard just\ngrinned.\n“I’m here,” Kaladin said, resting the Sylblade on his shoulder, “on orders\nfrom King Elhokar and the Blackthorn. It’s my job to save Kholinar. And\nit’s time you started talking to me.”\nShe smiled at him. “Come with me.”\n80.

Veil frowned, calling his name. After fleeing\nthe Oathgate platform, she’d met up with Vathah, who had been waiting as\ninstructed.\nShe’d sent Vathah back to report to the king, and probably should have\ngone herself. But she hadn’t been able to shake the eerie disquiet of her trip\nthrough the revel. Going back home would have left her too much time to\nthink.\nVeil wanted to be out working instead. Monsters and Voidbringers were\nsomething she couldn’t comprehend, but starving children … she could do\nsomething about that. She’d taken the two remaining sacks of food and\ngone to help the city’s people.\nIf she could find them.\n“Grund?” Veil repeated, leaning farther in through the window. Before,\nhe’d always been up at this time. Perhaps he’d finally moved out of the\nbuilding, like all the others had. Or maybe he hadn’t gotten back from the\nstormshelter yet, following the Everstorm.\nShe turned to leave, but Grund finally stumbled into the room. The little\nurchin tucked his malformed hand into his pocket and scowled at her. That\nwas odd. He normally seemed so happy when she arrived.\n“What’s wrong?” she asked.\n“Nothin’,” he said. “Thought you was someone else.” He gave her a\ngrin.\nVeil fished a few pieces of flatbread from her bag. “Not much today, I’m\nafraid. I wanted to make sure to stop by though. The information you gave\nus on that book was very helpful.”\nHe licked his lips, holding out his hands. She tossed him the flatbread,\nand he took an eager bite. “What do you need next?”\n“Nothing right now,” Veil said.\n“Come on. There has to be something I can do to help. Something you\nwant, right?”\nToo desperate, Veil thought. What is beneath the surface here? What\nhave I missed?\n“I’ll consider,” she said. “Grund, is everything all right?”\n“Right. Sure, everything is great!” He paused. “Unless it shouldn’t be?”\nPattern hummed softly on Veil’s coat. She agreed.\n“I’ll stop by again in a few days. Should have a big haul then.” Veil\ntipped her hat to the urchin, then slipped back into the market. It was late,\nbut people lingered. Nobody wanted to be alone on days after the Everstorm\ncame. Some looked toward the wall, where those Fused had attacked. But\nthat sort of thing happened almost daily, so it didn’t cause too much of a\nstir.\nVeil drew more attention than she’d have wanted. She’d exposed herself\nto them, given up her face.\n“Grund tells lies, doesn’t he?” Pattern whispered.\n“Yeah. I’m not sure why, or what about.”\nAs she wove into the market, she put her hand before her face, changing"

She took her hat off, folded it, and covertly\nLightwove it to look like a waterskin. Each was a little change that nobody\nwould notice. She tucked her hair into her coat, made it look shorter, then\nfinally closed her coat and changed the clothing underneath. When she took\noff the coat and folded it up, she was no longer Veil, but a market guard\nshe’d drawn earlier.\nRolled coat under her arm, she lingered at a corner and waited to see if\nanyone passed, looking for Veil. She didn’t spot anyone, though her training\nwith Ishnah at spotting tails wasn’t yet extensive. She threaded her way\nback through the crowd to Grund’s shop again. She lingered near the wall,\nthen eased toward the window, listening.\n“… Told you we shouldn’t have given her the book,” a voice was saying\ninside.\n“This is pathetic,” another said. “Pathetic! That was the best you could\ndo?”\nShe heard a grunt, and a whimper. That’s Grund. Veil cursed softly,\nscrambling around to look in through the window. A group of thugs was\nchewing on the flatbread she’d brought. Grund lay in the corner,\nwhimpering and holding his stomach.\nVeil felt a flash of rage, and angerspren immediately boiled around her,\npools that sprayed red and orange. She shouted at the men and dashed for\nthe doorway. They immediately scattered, though one slammed a cudgel\nonto Grund’s head with a sickening crunch.\nBy the time she reached Grund, the men had vanished farther into the\nbuilding. She heard the door in the back slam closed. Pattern appeared in\nher hand as a Shardblade, but Stormfather! She couldn’t give chase—not\nand leave the poor child here.\nVeil dismissed Pattern and knelt, aghast at the bloody wound in Grund’s\nhead. It was bad. The skull was broken, bleeding …\nHe blinked, dazed. “V … Veil?”\n“Storms, Grund,” she whispered. “I…” What could she do? “Help?\nHelp, somebody! There’s a wounded child in here!”\nGrund whimpered, then whispered something. Veil leaned close, feeling\nuseless.\n“Hate…” Grund whispered. “Hate you.”\n“It’s all right,” Veil said. “They’re gone now. They … they ran. I’ll\nhelp.” Bandage. She cut at her shirttails with her knife.\n“Hate you,” Grund whispered.\n“It’s me, Grund. Not those others.”\n“Why couldn’t you leave me alone?” he whispered. “They killed them\nall. My friends. Tai…”\nVeil pressed the cloth against his head wound, and he winced. Storms.\n“Quiet. Don’t exert yourself.”\n“Hate you,” he repeated.\n“I brought you food, Grund.”\n“You drew them,” he hissed. “You strutted around, throwing food.

She ran for Muri—the mother who\nhad once been a seamstress. Shallan shoved through the market until she\nreached the packed tenement where the seamstress lived. She crossed the\ncommon room, then breathed a sigh of relief as she found Muri alive, inside\nher small room. The woman was hurriedly tossing clothing into a sack, her\neldest daughter clutching a similar one.\nShe looked up, saw Shallan—who still looked like Veil—and cursed to\nherself. “You.” The frown lines and scowl were unfamiliar. She’d always\nseemed so pleasant.\n“You know already?” Shallan asked. “About Grund?”\n“Grund?” Muri snapped. “All I know is that the Grips are angry about\nsomething. I’m not going to take a chance.”\n“The Grips?”\n“How oblivious are you, woman? The gang in charge of this area has had\ntoughs watching us all for when you next arrived.

Kaladin\nstood instead, washing the blood from his hands with a damp rag at a water\nbasin.\n“Kaladin,” Azure mused. “A regal name. What’s your house?”\n“They just call me Stormblessed. If you need proof of my orders from\nthe king, it can be arranged.”\n“Let’s pretend, for the sake of conversation, that I believe you,” Azure\nsaid. “What do you want from us?”\n“I need to know how you’re using a Soulcaster without drawing the\nattention of the screaming spren. The secret might be essential to my work\nto save the city.”\nAzure nodded, then rose and walked toward the back of the barrack. She\nused a key to open the back room. Kaladin had glanced in there before\nthough. It only held some supplies.\nThe rest of them followed Azure into the room, where she slipped a\nsmall hook between two stones and threw a hidden latch. This let her\nremove a stone, revealing a handle. She heaved, pulling open a doorway.\nThe light of a few handheld spheres revealed a small corridor that ran down\nthe middle of the city wall.\n“You cut a tunnel in one of the windblades, sir?” Beard asked, shocked.\n“This has been here longer than any of us have been alive, soldier,”\nBattalionlord Hadinar said. “It is a quick, secret way between posts. There\nare even a few hidden stairwells up to the top.”\nThey had to go single file inside. Beard followed behind Kaladin,\nscrunched up against him in the confines. “Um, so Kal, you … you know\nthe Blackthorn?”\n“Better than most.”\n“And … ahem … you know—”\n“That the two of you never went swimming together in the Purelake?”\nKaladin said. “Yes, though I suspect the rest of the squad guessed that,\nBeard.”\n“Yeah,” he said, glancing back at the others. He exhaled softly. “I figured\nyou’d never believe the truth, since it was actually the Azish emperor.…”\nThis corridor, cut through the stone, reminded Kaladin of the strata of\nUrithiru. They reached a trapdoor in the floor, which Azure opened with a\nkey.

She knelt beside a stone block, and\nwore a distinctive fabrial on her hand—one that glowed powerfully with\nlight from the emeralds it contained.\nThe woman had an inhuman look to her; she seemed to be growing vines\nunder her skin, and they peeked out around her eyes, growing from the\ncorners and spreading down her face like runners of ivy.\nShe stood and bowed to Azure. A real Soulcaster. So … Azure wasn’t\ndoing it herself? “How?” Kaladin asked. “Why didn’t the screamers come\nfor you?”\nAzure pointed at the sides of the room, and for the first time Kaladin\nnoticed the walls were covered in reflective metal plates. He frowned and\nrested his fingers against one, and found it cool to the touch. This wasn’t\nsteel, was it?\n“Soon after the strangeness at the palace began,” Azure said, “a man\npulled a chull cart up to the front of our barrack. He had these sheets of\nmetal in the back. He was … an odd fellow. I’ve had interactions with him\nbefore.”\n“Angular features?” Kaladin guessed. “Quick with an insult. Silly and\nstraight, somehow all at once?”\n“You know him, I see,” Azure said. “He warned us to only Soulcast\ninside a room lined with this metal. So far as we can tell, it prevents the\nscreamers from sensing us. Unfortunately, it also blocks spanreeds from\ncontacting the outside.\n“We keep poor Ithi and her sister working nonstop, trading off the\nSoulcaster. Feeding the entire city would be an impossible task for the two\nof them, but we’ve been able to at least keep our army strong, with some to\nspare.”\nDamnation, Kaladin thought, inspecting the reflective walls. This wasn’t\ngoing to help him use his powers without notice.\n“All right, Stormblessed,” Azure said. “I’ve opened our secrets to you.\nNow you’ll tell me how the king could expect one man, even a Shardbearer,\nto be able to save this city.”\n“There’s a device in Kholinar,” he said, “of ancient design. It can\ninstantly transport large groups of people across great distances.” He turned\ntoward Azure and the others. “The Kholin armies wait to join us here. All\nwe need to do is activate the device—something that only a select few\npeople can do.”\nThe soldiers looked stunned—all but Azure, who perked up. “Really?\nYou’re serious?”\nKaladin nodded.\n“Great! Let’s get this thing working! Where is it?”\nKaladin took a deep breath. “Well, that happens to be the problem.…”\n82. The Girl Who Stood Up\nSurely this will bring—at long last—the end to war that the Heralds\npromised us.\n—From drawer 30-20, final emerald\nShe huddled someplace. She’d forgotten where.\nFor a while, she’d been … everybody. A hundred faces, cycling one after\nanother. She searched them for comfort. Surely she could find someone who\ndidn’t hurt."

Surely she could find someone who\ndidn’t hurt.\nAll the nearby refugees had fled, naming her a spren. They left her with\nthose hundred faces, in silence, until her Stormlight died off.\nThat left only Shallan. Unfortunately.\nDarkness. A candle snuffed out. A scream cut off. With nothing to see,\nher mind provided images.\nHer father, his face turning purple as she strangled him, singing a lullaby.\nHer mother, dead with burned eyes.\nTyn, run through by Pattern.\nKabsal, shaking on the floor as he succumbed to poison.\nYalb, the incorrigible sailor from Wind’s Pleasure, dead in the depths of\nthe sea.\nAn unnamed coachman, murdered by members of the Ghostbloods.\nNow Grund, his head opened up.\nVeil had tried to help these people, but had succeeded only in making\ntheir lives worse. The lie that was Veil became suddenly manifest. She\nhadn’t lived on the streets and she didn’t know how to help people.\nPretending to have experience didn’t mean she actually did.\nVeil had always thought to herself that Shallan could handle the big\npicture, the Voidbringers and the Unmade. Now she had to confront the\ntruth that she had no idea what to do. She couldn’t get to the Oathgate. It\nwas guarded by an ancient spren that could get inside her brain.\nThe whole city was depending on her, but she hadn’t even been able to\nsave a little beggar boy. As she curled up on the floor, Grund’s death\nseemed a shadow of everything else, of her good intentions turned arrogant.\nEverywhere she trod, death haunted her. Every face she wore was a lie to\npretend she could stop it.\nCouldn’t she be somebody who didn’t hurt, just once?\nLight pushed shadows before it, long and slender. She blinked,\nmomentarily transfixed. How many days had it been since she’d seen light?\nA figure stepped into the common room outside her little hole of a chamber.\nShe was still in the long room Muri had lived in.\nShe sniffled softly.\nThe newcomer brought his light to her doorway, then carefully stepped\ninside and settled down across from her, his back against the wall. The\nroom was narrow enough that his legs stretched out and touched the wall\nbeside her. She had hers drawn up, knees against her chest, head resting on\nthem.\nWit didn’t speak. He put his sphere on the floor, and let her have the\nsilence.\n“I should have known better,” she finally whispered.\n“Perhaps,” Wit said.\n“Giving out so much food only drew predators. Foolish. I should have\nfocused on the Oathgate.”\n“Again, perhaps.”\n“It’s so hard, Wit. When I wear Veil’s face … I … I have to think like\nher. Seeing the larger scope grows difficult when she takes over. And I want\nher to take over, because she’s not me.”\n“The thieves who killed that child have been seen to,” Wit said.\nShe looked up at him.\n“When some of the men in the market heard what had happened,” Wit"

They\nrushed the Grips, forcing them to give up the murderer, then disperse. I\napologize for not acting sooner; I had been distracted by other tasks. You’ll\nbe pleased to know that some of the food you gave away was still in their\nbase.”\n“Was it worth that boy’s life?” Shallan whispered.\n“I cannot judge the worth of a life. I would not dare to attempt it.”\n“Muri said it would be better if I were dead.”\n“As I lack the experience to decide the worth of a life, I sincerely doubt\nthat she has somehow obtained it. You tried to help the people of the\nmarket. You mostly failed. This is life. The longer you live, the more you\nfail. Failure is the mark of a life well lived. In turn, the only way to live\nwithout failure is to be of no use to anyone. Trust me, I’ve practiced.”\nShe sniffled, looking away. “I have to become Veil to escape the\nmemories, but I don’t have the experience that she pretends to have. I\nhaven’t lived her life.”\n“No,” Wit said softly. “You’ve lived a harsher one, haven’t you?”\n“Yet still, somehow, a naive one.” She drew in a deep, ragged breath.\nShe had to stop this. She knew she had to get over the tantrum and go back\nto the tailor’s shop.\nShe’d do it. She’d shove all this into the back of her mind, with\neverything else she ignored. They could all fester together.\nWit settled back. “Have you heard the story of the Girl Who Looked\nUp?”\nShallan didn’t reply.\n“It’s a story from long ago,” Wit said. He cupped his hands around the\nsphere on the floor. “Things were different in that time. A wall kept out the\nstorms, but everyone ignored it. All but one girl, who looked up one day,\nand contemplated it.”\n“Why is there a wall?” Shallan whispered.\n“Oh, so you do know it? Good.” He leaned down, blowing at the crem\ndust on the floor. It swirled up, making a figure of a girl. It gave the brief\nimpression of her standing before a wall, but then disintegrated back into\ndust. He tried again, and it swirled a little higher this time, but still fell back\nto dust.\n“A little help?” he asked. He pushed a bag of spheres across the ground\ntoward Shallan.\nShallan sighed, then picked up the bag and drew in the Stormlight. It\nstarted to rage within her, demanding to be used, so she stood up and\nbreathed out, Weaving it into an illusion she’d done once before. A pristine\nvillage, and a young girl standing and looking upward, toward an\nimpossibly tall wall in the distance.\nThe illusion made the room seem to vanish.

She hadn’t made them invisible; they\nwere merely covered up in a way that made it seem Shallan and Wit were\nstanding in another place.\nThis was … this was more than she’d ever done before. But was she\nreally doing it? Shallan shook her head and stepped up beside the girl, who\nwore long scarves.\nWit stepped up on the other side. “Hmmm,” he said. “Not bad. But it’s\nnot dark enough.”\n“What?”\n“I thought you knew the story,” Wit said, tapping the air. The color and\nlight bled from her illusion, leaving them standing in the darkness of night,\nlit only by a frail set of stars. The wall was an enormous blot before them.\n“In these days, there was no light.”\n“No light…”\n“Of course, even without light, people still had to live, didn’t they?\nThat’s what people do. I hasten to guess it’s the first thing they learn how to\ndo. So they lived in the darkness, farmed in the darkness, ate in the\ndarkness.” He waved behind him. People stumbled about in the village,\nfeeling their way to different activities, barely able to see by the starlight.\nIn this context, strange though it seemed, some pieces of the story as\nshe’d told it made sense. When the girl went up to people and asked, “Why\nis there a wall?” it was obvious why they found it so easy to ignore.\nThe illusion followed Wit’s words as the girl in the scarves asked several\npeople about the wall. Don’t go beyond it, or you shall die.\n“And so,” Wit said, “she decided that the only way she’d find answers\nwould be to climb the wall herself.” He glanced at Shallan. “Was she stupid\nor bold?”\n“How should I know?”\n“Wrong answer. She was both.”\n“It wasn’t stupid. If nobody asked questions, then we would never learn\nanything.”\n“What of the wisdom of her elders?”\n“They offered no explanation for why she shouldn’t ask about the wall!\nNo rationalization, no justification. There’s a difference between listening to\nyour elders and just being as frightened as everyone else.”\nWit smiled, the sphere in his hand lighting his face. “Funny, isn’t it, how\nso many of our stories start the same way, but have opposing endings? In\nhalf, the child ignores her parents, wanders out into the woods, and gets\neaten. In the other half she discovers great wonders. There aren’t many\nstories about the kids who say, ‘Yes, I shall not go into the forest. I’m glad\nmy parents explained that is where the monsters live.’ ”\n“Is that what you’re trying to teach me, then?” Shallan snapped. “The\nfine distinction between choosing for yourself and ignoring good advice?”\n“I’m a terrible teacher.” He waved his hand as the girl reached the wall\nafter a long hike. She started to climb. “Fortunately, I am an artist, and not a\nteacher.”\n“People learn things from art.”\n“Blasphemy! Art is not art if it has a function.”\nShallan rolled her eyes."

Some of her Stormlight\nsplit off from her, spinning above his hand and making an image of a\nfloating fork in the darkness. “It has a use. Eating. Now, if it were to be\nornamented by a master artisan, would that change its function?” The fork\ngrew intricate embossing in the form of growing leaves. “No, of course not.\nIt has the same use, ornamented or not. The art is the part that serves no\npurpose.”\n“It makes me happy, Wit. That’s a purpose.”\nHe grinned, and the fork disappeared.\n“Weren’t we in the middle of a story about a girl climbing a wall?”\nShallan asked.\n“Yes, but that part takes forever,” he said. “I’m finding things to occupy\nus.”\n“We could just skip the boring part.”\n“Skip?” Wit said, aghast. “Skip part of a story?”\nShallan snapped her fingers, and the illusion shifted so that they stood\natop the wall in the darkness. The girl in the scarves finally—after toiling\nmany days—pulled herself up beside them.\n“You wound me,” Wit said. “What happens next?”\n“The girl finds steps,” Shallan said. “And the girl realizes that the wall\nwasn’t to keep something in, but to keep her and her people out.”\n“Because?”\n“Because we’re monsters.”\nWit stepped over to Shallan, then quietly folded his arms around her. She\ntrembled, then twisted, burying her face in his shirt.\n“You’re not a monster, Shallan,” Wit whispered. “Oh, child. The world is\nmonstrous at times, and there are those who would have you believe that\nyou are terrible by association.”\n“I am.”\n“No. For you see, it flows the other direction. You are not worse for your\nassociation with the world, but it is better for its association with you.”\nShe pressed against him, shivering. “What do I do, Wit?” she whispered.\n“I know … I know I shouldn’t be in so much pain. I had to…” She took a\ndeep breath. “I had to kill them. I had to. But now I’ve said the words, and I\ncan’t ignore it anymore. So I should … should just die too, for having done\nit.…”\nWit waved to the side, toward where the girl in the scarves still\noverlooked a new world. What was that long pack she had set down beside\nher?\n“So you remember,” Wit said gently, “the rest of the story?”\n“It’s not important. We found the moral already. The wall kept people\nout.”\n“Why?”\n“Because…” What had she told Pattern before, when she’d been\nshowing him this story?\n“Because,” Wit said, pointing, “beyond the wall was God’s Light.”\nIt burst alight in a sudden explosion: a brilliant and powerful brightness\nthat lit the landscape beyond the wall. Shallan gasped as it shone over them.\nThe girl in the scarves gasped in turn, and saw the world in all its colors for\nthe first time."

Shallan gasped as it shone over them.\nThe girl in the scarves gasped in turn, and saw the world in all its colors for\nthe first time.\n“She climbed down the steps,” Shallan whispered, watching the girl run\ndown the steps, scarves streaming behind her. “She hid among the creatures\nwho lived on this side. She sneaked up to the Light and she brought it back\nwith her. To the other side. To the … to the land of shadows…”\n“Yes indeed,” Wit said as the scene played out, the girl in the scarves\nslipping up to the grand source of light, then breaking off a little piece in\nher hand.\nAn incredible chase.\nThe girl climbing the steps frantically.\nA crazed descent.\nAnd then … light, for the first time in the village, followed by the\ncoming of the storms—boiling over the wall.\n“The people suffered,” Wit said, “but each storm brought light renewed,\nfor it could never be put back, now that it had been taken. And people, for\nall their hardship, would never choose to go back. Not now that they could\nsee.”\nThe illusion faded, leaving the two of them standing in the common\nroom of the building, Muri’s little chamber off to the side. Shallan pulled\nback, ashamed at having wept on his shirt.\n“Do you wish,” Wit asked, “that you could go back to not being able to\nsee?”\n“No,” she whispered.\n“Then live. And let your failures be part of you.”\n“That sounds … that sounds an awful lot like a moral, Wit. Like you’re\ntrying to do something useful.”\n“Well, as I said, we all fail now and then.” He swept his hands to the\nsides, as if brushing something away from Shallan. Stormlight curled out\nfrom her right and left, swirling, then forming into two identical versions of\nShallan. They stood with ruddy hair, mottled faces, and sweeping white\ncoats that belonged to someone else.\n“Wit…” she started.\n“Hush.” He walked up to one of the illusions, inspecting it, tapping his\nchin with his index finger. “A lot has happened to this poor girl, hasn’t it?”\n“Many people have suffered more and they get along fine.”\n“Fine?”\nShallan shrugged, unable to banish the truths she’d spoken. The distant\nmemory of singing to her father as she strangled him. The people she’d\nfailed, the problems she’d caused. The illusion of Shallan to the left gasped,\nthen backed up against the wall of the room, shaking her head. She\ncollapsed, head down against her legs, curling up.\n“Poor fool,” Shallan whispered. “Everything she tries only makes the\nworld worse. She was broken by her father, then broke herself in turn. She’s\nworthless, Wit.” She gritted her teeth, found herself sneering. “It’s not really\nher fault, but she’s still worthless.”\nWit grunted, then pointed at the second illusion, standing behind them.\n“And that one?”\n“No different,” Shallan said, tiring of this game. She gave the second\nillusion the same memories. Father. Helaran. Failing Jasnah. Everything.\nThe illusory Shallan stiffened. Then set her jaw and stood there."

They’re the same in every detail.”\n“Of course they’re not,” Shallan said, tapping the illusion, feeling it. A\nsense pulsed through her from it, memories and pain. And … and\nsomething smothering them …\nForgiveness. For herself.\nShe gasped, pulling her finger back as if it had been bitten.\n“It’s terrible,” Wit said, stepping up beside her, “to have been hurt. It’s\nunfair, and awful, and horrid. But Shallan … it’s okay to live on.”\nShe shook her head.\n“Your other minds take over,” he whispered, “because they look so much\nmore appealing. You’ll never control them until you’re confident in\nreturning to the one who birthed them. Until you accept being you.”\n“Then I’ll never control it.” She blinked tears.\n“No,” Wit said. He nodded toward the version of her still standing up.\n“You will, Shallan. If you do not trust yourself, can you trust me? For in\nyou, I see a woman more wonderful than any of the lies. I promise you, that\nwoman is worth protecting. You are worth protecting.”\nShe nodded toward the illusion of herself still standing. “I can’t be her.\nShe’s just another fabrication.”\nBoth illusions vanished. “I see only one woman here,” Wit said. “And\nit’s the one who is standing up. Shallan, that has always been you. You just\nhave to admit it. Allow it.” He whispered to her. “It’s all right to hurt.”\nHe picked up his pack, then unfolded something from inside it. Veil’s\nhat. He pressed the hat into her palm.\nShockingly, morning light was shining in the doorway. Had she been\nhere all night, huddled in this hole of a room?\n“Wit?” she asked. “I … I can’t do it.”\nHe smiled. “There are certain things I know, Shallan. This is one of\nthem. You can. Find the balance. Accept the pain, but don’t accept that you\ndeserved it.”\nPattern hummed in appreciation of that. But, it wasn’t as easy as Wit\nsaid. She took in a breath, and felt … a shiver run through her. Wit collected\nhis things, pack over his shoulder. He smiled, then stepped out into the\nlight.\nShallan released her breath, feeling foolish. She followed Wit out into\nthe light, emerging into the market, which hadn’t quite woken up yet. She\ndidn’t see Wit outside, but that was no surprise. He had a way of being\nwhere he shouldn’t, but not being where you’d expect.\nCarrying Veil’s hat, she walked the street, feeling odd to be herself in\ntrousers and coat. Red hair, but a safehand glove. Should she hide?\nWhy? This felt … fine. She walked all the way back to the tailor’s shop\nand peeked in. Adolin sat at a table inside, bleary-eyed."

Should she explain?\n“Nice,” Adolin said. “Shallan, that’s sharp. The red on white.” He\nstepped back, nodding. “Did Yokska make that for you? Let me see the hat\non you.”\nOh, Adolin, she thought, pulling on the hat.\n“The jacket is a hair too loose,” Adolin said. “But the style is a really\ngood match. Bold. Crisp.” He cocked his head. “Would look better with a\nsword at your waist. Maybe…” He trailed off. “Do you hear that?”\nShe turned, frowning. It sounded like marching. “A parade this early?”\nThey looked out at the street and found Kaladin approaching along with\nwhat seemed to be an army of five or six hundred men, wearing the\nuniforms of the Wall Guard.\nAdolin sighed softly. “Of course. He’s probably their leader now or\nsomething. Storming bridgeboy.”\nKaladin marched his men right up to the front of the tailor’s shop. She\nand Adolin stepped out to meet him, and she heard Elhokar scrambling\ndown the steps inside, shouting at what he’d apparently seen out the\nwindow.\nKaladin was speaking softly with a woman in armor, helm under her\narm, face crossed by a pair of scars. Highmarshal Azure was younger than\nShallan had expected.\nThe soldiers grew hushed as they saw Adolin, then the king, who was\nalready dressed.\n“So that’s what you meant,” Azure said to Kaladin.\n“Stormblessed?” Elhokar asked. “What is this?”\n“You’ve been wanting an army to attack the palace, Your Majesty,”\nKaladin said. “Well, we’re ready.”\n83.

He checked the glyphward Shallan had\nmade him at his request—determination—wrapped around his forearm.\nThen he finally realized what was bothering him.\nHe summoned his Shardblade.\nIt was thick at the base, as wide as a man’s palm, and the front waved\nlike the ripples of a moving eel. The back had small crystalline protrusions\ngrowing out of it. No sheath could hold a weapon like this, and no mortal\nsword could imitate it—not without growing unusably heavy. You knew a\nShardblade when you saw one. That was the point.\nAdolin held the weapon before him in the lavatory, looking at his\nreflection in the metal. “I don’t have my mother’s necklace,” he said, “or\nany of the other traditions I used to follow. I never really needed those. I’ve\nonly ever needed you.”\nHe took a deep breath. “I guess … I guess you used to be alive. The\nothers say they can hear your screaming if they touch you. That you’re\ndead, yet somehow still in pain. I’m sorry. I can’t do anything about that,\nbut … thank you. Thank you for assisting me all these years. And if it helps,\nI’m going to use you to do something good today. I’ll try to always use you\nthat way.”\nHe felt better as he dismissed the Blade. Of course, he carried another\nweapon: his belt knife, long and thin. A weapon intended for stabbing\narmored men.\nIt had felt so satisfying to shove it through Sadeas’s eye. He still didn’t\nknow whether to feel ashamed or proud. He sighed, checked himself in the\nmirror, then made another quick decision.\nWhen he walked down the steps to the main room a short time later, he\nwas wearing his Kholin uniform. His skin missed the softer silk and better\nform of the tailored outfit, but he found he walked taller in this one. Despite\nthe fact that a part of him, deep down, worried he didn’t deserve to bear his\nfather’s glyphs any longer.\nHe nodded to Elhokar, who was speaking with the strange woman\nknown as Highmarshal Azure. “My scouts have been driven back,” she said.\n“But they saw enough, Your Majesty. The Voidbringer army is here, in its\nstrength. They’ll attack today or tomorrow for certain.”\n“Well,” Elhokar said. “I suppose I understand why you did what you had\nto in taking control of the Guard. I can’t very well have you hanged as a\nusurper. Good work, Highmarshal.”\n“I … appreciate that?”\nShallan, Kaladin, Skar, and Drehy were standing with a palace map.\nThey needed to memorize the layout. Adolin and Elhokar, of course,\nalready knew it. Shallan had chosen not to change out of the fetching white\noutfit she’d been wearing earlier. It would be more functional for an assault\nthan a skirt. Storms, there was something about a woman in trousers and a\ncoat.\nElhokar left Azure to take reports from some of her men.

All they’d needed to do was walk\naway from the spheres powering their illusions, and their true faces had\nbecome manifest.\nSome of these men were opportunists, but many were loyalists. They’d\nbrought some hundred men-at-arms with them—not as many as Kaladin\nhad brought from the Wall Guard, but still, Elhokar seemed proud of what\nhe had done in gathering them. As well he should.\nTogether, he and Adolin joined the Radiants near the front of the shop.\nElhokar waved for the highlords to join them, then spoke firmly. “Is\neveryone clear?” Elhokar asked.\n“Storm the palace,” Kaladin said. “Seize the Sunwalk, cross to the\nOathgate platform, hold it while Shallan tries to drive away the Unmade\nlike she did in Urithiru. Then we activate the Oathgate, and bring troops to\nKholinar.”\n“The control building is completely overgrown with that black heart,\nYour Majesty,” Shallan said. “I don’t truly know how I drove away the\nMidnight Mother—and I certainly don’t know that I’ll be able to do the\nsame here.”\n“But you’re willing to try?” the king asked.\n“Yes.” She took a deep breath. Adolin squeezed her on the shoulder\nreassuringly.\n“Windrunner,” the king said. “The duty I give you and your men is to get\nQueen Aesudan and the heir to safety. If the Oathgate works, we take them\nthat way. If not, you must fly them out of the city.”\nAdolin glanced at the highlords, who seemed to be taking all of this—the\narrival of Knights Radiant, the king’s decision to storm his own palace—in\nstride. He knew a little of how they felt. Voidbringers, Everstorm, corrupted\nspren in the city … eventually, you stopped being shocked at what\nhappened to you.\n“Are we sure this path across the Sunwalk is the best way?” Kaladin\nasked, pointing at the map Drehy was holding. He moved his finger from\nthe palace’s eastern gallery, along the Sunwalk onto the Oathgate platform.\nAdolin nodded. “It’s the best way to the Oathgate. Those narrow steps up\nthe outside of that plateau would be murder to storm. Our best chance is to\ngo up the palace’s front steps, bring down the doors with our Shardblades,\nand fight through the entryway to the eastern gallery. From there, you can\ngo up to the right to reach the king’s quarters, or go straight across the\nSunwalk.”\n“I don’t relish fighting along this corridor,” Kaladin said. “We have to\nassume that the Fused will join the battle on the side of the Palace Guard.”\n“It’s possible I can distract them, if they do come,” Shallan said.\nKaladin grunted and didn’t complain further. He saw, as Adolin did. This\nwasn’t going to be an easy fight—there were a lot of choke points the\ndefenders could use. But what else could they do?"

Kaladin\nlooked toward them.\n“Another raid?” one of the highlords asked.\n“Worse,” Kaladin said as, behind them, Azure cursed softly. “That’s the\nsignal that the city’s under attack.”\nAzure pushed out the front doors of the tailor’s shop, and the rest of\nthem followed. Most of the six hundred men here belonged to the Wall\nGuard, and some stepped toward the distant walls, gripping spears and\nshields.\n“Steady, men,” Azure called. “Your Majesty, the bulk of my soldiers are\ndying on the wall in a hopeless fight. I’m here because Stormblessed\nconvinced me that the only way to help them is to take that palace. So if\nwe’re going to do it, the time is now.”\n“We march, then!” Elhokar said. “Highmarshal, Brightlords, pass the\nword to your forces. Organize ranks! We march on the palace at my\ncommand!”\nAdolin turned as some Fused coursed through the sky along the distant\nwall. Enemy Surgebinders. Storms. He shook his head and hurried over to\nYokska and her husband. They had watched all this—the arrival of an army\non their doorstep, the preparations for an assault—with bewilderment.\n“If the city holds,” Adolin said, “you’ll be fine. But if it falls…” He took\na deep breath. “Reports from other cities indicate that there won’t be\nwholesale slaughter. The Voidbringers are here to occupy, not exterminate.\nI’d still suggest you prepare to flee the city and make your way to the\nShattered Plains.”\n“The Shattered Plains?” Yokska asked, aghast. “But Brightlord, that’s\nhundreds and hundreds of miles!”\n“I know,” he said, wincing. “Thank you so much for taking us in. We’re\ngoing to do what we can to stop this.”\nNearby, Elhokar approached the timid ardent who had come with Azure.\nHe had been hurriedly painting glyphwards for the soldiers, and jumped as\nElhokar took him by the shoulder and shoved an object into his hand.\n“What’s this?” the ardent asked, nervous.\n“It’s a spanreed,” Elhokar said. “A half hour after my army marches, you\nare to contact Urithiru and warn them to get their forces ready to transfer\nhere, via the Oathgate.”\n“I can’t use a fabrial! The screamers—”\n“Steady, man! The enemy may be too preoccupied by their attack to\nnotice you. But even if they do, you must take the risk. Our armies must be\nready. The fate of the city could depend upon this.”\nThe ardent nodded, pale.\nAdolin joined the troops, calming his nerves by force. Just another battle.\nHe’d been in dozens, if not hundreds of those. But storms, he was used to\nempty fields of stone, not streets.\nNearby, a small group of guardsmen chatted softly. “We’ll be fine,” one\nof them was saying.

He was a shorter man, clean-shaven, though he had\nstrikingly hairy arms. “I tell you, I saw my own death up there on the wall.\nShe streaked toward me, lance held right toward my heart. I looked in those\nred eyes, and I saw myself dying. Then … he was there. He shot from the\ntower window like an arrow and crashed into the Voidbringer. That spear\nwas meant for my life, and he changed fate, I tell you. I swear, he was\nglowing when he did it.…”\nWe’re entering an era of gods, Adolin thought.\nElhokar raised his Shardblade high and gave the command. They\nmarched through the city, passing worried refugees. Rows of buildings with\ndoors shut tight, as if in preparation for a storm. Eventually, the palace rose\nbefore the army like an obsidian block. The very stones seemed to have\nchanged color.\nAdolin summoned his Shardblade, and the sight of it seemed to give\ncomfort to the men nearby. Their march took them toward the northern\nsection of the city, near the city wall. Here, the Fused were visible,\nattacking the troops. A strange thumping started, and Adolin took it as\nanother set of drums—until a head crested the top of the wall nearest them.\nStorms! It had an enormous stone wedge of a face that reminded him of\nthat of some greatshell beast, though its eyes were just red spots glowing\nfrom deep within.\nThe monster pulled itself up by one arm. It didn’t seem quite as tall as\nthe city walls, but it was still enormous. Fused buzzed about as it swatted\nalong the wall—spraying defenders like cremlings—then smashed a guard\ntower.\nAdolin realized that he, along with much of their force, had stopped to\nstare at the daunting sight. The ground trembled as stones tumbled down a\nfew blocks away, smashing into buildings.\n“Keep moving!” Azure called. “Storms! They’re trying to get in and beat\nus to the palace!”\nThe monster ripped apart the guard tower, then with a casual flip tossed a\nboulder the size of a horse toward them. Adolin gaped, feeling powerless as\nthe rock inexorably hurtled toward him and the troops.\nKaladin rose into the air on a streak of light.\nHe hit the stone and rolled with it, twisting and tumbling in the air. His\nglow diminished severely.\nThe boulder lurched. It somehow changed momentum, tossed away from\nKaladin like a pebble flicked off the table. It crested the city wall, narrowly\nmissing the monster that had thrown it. Adolin faintly heard spren begin to\nscream, but that was drowned out by the sounds of rock falling and people\non the streets shouting.\nKaladin renewed himself with Stormlight from his pack. He was\ncarrying most of the gemstones they’d brought from Urithiru, a wealth from\nthe emerald reserve, to use in their mission and in opening the Oathgate.\nDrehy rose into the air beside him, then Skar, who had Lashed Shallan\nupward as well.

Adolin knew she was basically immortal, but it was still\nstrange to see her here, on the front lines.\n“We’ll distract the Fused,” Kaladin shouted to Adolin, pointing at a\ngroup of figures flying through the air in their direction. “And—if we can—\nwe’ll seize the Sunwalk. Get in through the palace, and meet with us in the\neastern gallery!”\nThey zipped off. In the near distance, the monster started pounding on\nthe gates there, cracking and splintering the wood.\n“Forward!” Azure yelled.\nAdolin charged, running up beside Elhokar and Azure. They reached the\npalace grounds and surged up the steps. At the top, soldiers in very similar\nuniforms—black and a darker blue, but still Kholin—withdrew, shutting the\npalace’s front doors.\n“King’s Guard,” Adolin shouted, pointing at a group of men in red who\nhad been designated as Elhokar’s honor guard. “Be sure to watch the king’s\nflanks as he cuts! Don’t let the enemy strike at him as the door falls!”\nMen crowded up the steps, taking positions along the front of the\npalace’s front porch. They held spears, though some were lighteyed. Adolin,\nAzure, and Elhokar each went to a separate door atop the steps. Here, the\nfront of the palace roof—held up by thick columns—shielded them from\nthe stones that the creature was flinging.\nTeeth gritted, Adolin rammed his Blade into the crack between the thick\nwooden palace door and the wall. He swiped upward quickly, cutting\nthrough both hinges and the bar that had been thrown on the inside. After\nanother slice down the other side freed the door, he stepped back into\nposition. It fell inward with a crash.\nImmediately, the enemy soldiers inside rammed spears outward, hoping\nto catch Adolin. He danced back, and didn’t dare swing. Wielding a\nShardblade with one hand was a challenge, even when you didn’t have to\nworry about hitting your own men.\nHe skipped to the side and let the Wall Guard attack the doorway.\nAdolin, instead, moved over beside a group of soldiers who had come with\nHighlord Urimil. Here, Adolin cut through a section of the wall, making an\nimprovised doorway that the soldiers shoved open. He moved down the\nlong porch, opening another, then a third.\nThat done, he peeked in on Elhokar, who had stepped through his felled\ndoor, and was now inside the palace. He swept about himself with his Blade\nin a one-handed grip, shield held in the other. He opened a pocket in the\nenemy soldiers, having killed dozens already.\nCareful, Elhokar, Adolin thought. Remember, you don’t have Plate.\nAdolin pointed at a platoon of soldiers. “Reinforce the King’s Guard, and\nmake sure he doesn’t get overwhelmed. If he does, shout for me.”\nThey saluted, and Adolin stepped back. Azure had cut down her door,\nbut her Shardblade wasn’t as long as the other two.

As he watched, she stabbed an enemy soldier who tried to push\nthrough. Remarkably, his eyes didn’t burn, though his skin did go a strange\nashen grey as he died.\nBlood of my fathers, Adolin thought. What’s wrong with her Blade?\nEven with all the opened doorways, getting into the palace was slow\ngoing. The men inside had formed shield-wall rings around the doorways,\nand the fighting mostly happened with men using short spears to stab at\neach other. Some platoons of Wall Guard brought in longer pikes to break\nthe ranks of defenders, preparing for a surge.\n“You men ever flank-shielded a Shardbearer?” Adolin said to the nearest\nsquad of soldiers.\n“No sir,” said one of the men. “But we’ve done the training.…”\n“It’ll have to do,” Adolin said, taking his Blade in two hands. “I’m going\nin that center hole. Stay close and keep the spears off my sides. I’ll be\ncareful not to catch you in my sweeps.”\n“Yes, sir!” their squadleader said.\nAdolin took a deep breath, then approached the opening. The interior\nbristled with spears. Like the proverbial whitespine’s den.\nAt Adolin’s instruction, a soldier on his side faced his men and did a\ncountdown with one hand. As the last finger dropped, the soldiers at the\ndoorway fell back. Adolin charged through into the palace entry hall, with\nits marble floors and high vaulted ceilings.\nThe enemy thrust a dozen spears at him. He ducked low, taking a slice\non the shoulder as he did a two-handed sweep, cutting a group of soldiers at\nthe knees. The enemy dropped, their legs ruined by the Shardblade.\nFour men followed him in and raised shields at his sides. Adolin attacked\nforward, hacking the fronts off spears, cutting at hands. Storms … the men\nhe fought were too silent. They’d cry in pain if stabbed, or grunt with\nexertion, but they otherwise seemed muted—as if the darkness smothered\ntheir emotions.\nAdolin took his Blade in an overhead grip and fell into Stonestance,\nswiping down with precise cuts, felling man after man in a careful,\ncontrolled set of strikes. His soldiers protected his flanks, while the wide\nreach of the Blade protected his front.\nEyes burned. The shield line wavered. “Fall back three steps!” Adolin\nshouted to his men, then transitioned to Windstance and swept outward with\nwide, flowing sweeps.\nIn the passion and beauty of dueling, he sometimes forgot how terrible a\nweapon Shardblades were. Here, as he rampaged among the faltering line, it\nwas all too obvious. He killed eight men in a moment, and completely\ndestroyed the defensive line.\n“Go!” he shouted, pointing with his Blade. Men surged through the\ndoorway and seized the ground just inside the entry hall. Nearby, Elhokar\nstood tall, his narrow Shardblade glittering as he called commands. Soldiers\nfell, dying and cursing—the true sounds of battle. The price of conflict.\nThe enemy finally broke, falling back through the entry hall—which was"

The price of conflict.\nThe enemy finally broke, falling back through the entry hall—which was\ntoo large to hold—toward the narrower hallway leading to the eastern\ngallery.\n“Pull out the wounded!” Azure called, stepping in. “Seventh Company,\nhold that far side of the room, make sure they don’t try to rush back in.\nThird Company, sweep the wings and make sure there aren’t any surprises.”\nCuriously, Azure had removed her cloak and wrapped it half around her\nleft arm. Adolin had never seen anything like it; perhaps she was\naccustomed to fighting in Plate.\nAdolin got some water, then let a surgeon bandage the shallow cut he’d\ntaken. Though the depths of the palace felt like caverns, this entryway was\nglorious. Walls of marble, polished and reflective. Grand staircases, and a\nbright red rug down the center. He’d burned that as a child once, playing\nwith a candle.\nCut bandaged, he joined Azure, Elhokar, and several of the highlords,\nwho were studying the wide corridor that led to the eastern gallery. The\nenemy had formed an excellent shield wall here. They’d settled in, and men\nin the second rank had crossbows ready and waiting.\n“That’s going to be crimson to break,” Azure said. “We’ll fight for every\ninch.”\nOutside, the crashing at the gate finally grew silent.\n“They’re in,” Adolin guessed. “That breach isn’t far from here.”\nHighlord Shaday grunted. “Maybe our enemies will turn against one\nanother? Can we hope the Voidbringers and the Palace Guard will start\nfighting each other?”\n“No,” Elhokar said. “The forces that have darkened the palace belong to\nthe enemy who now fights quickly to reach us. They know the danger the\nOathgate presents.”\n“Agreed,” Adolin said. “This palace will soon be swarming with\nparshman troops.”\n“Gather your men,” Elhokar said to the group. “Azure has command of\nthe assault. Highmarshal, you must clear this hallway.”\nOne of the highlords looked at the woman and cleared his throat, but\nthen decided not to say anything.\nGrim, Azure commanded archers to use shortbows to try to soften the\nenemy. But that shield wall was built to hold out against arrows, so Azure\ngave the order, and her men advanced against the fortified enemy.\nAdolin looked away as the corridor became a meat grinder, crossbow\nbolts smacking against men in waves. The Wall Guard had shields too, but\nthey had to risk advancing, and a crossbow could punch.\nAdolin had never been good at this part of battlefield fighting. Storm it,\nhe wanted to be at the front, leading the charge. The rational part of him\nknew that would be stupid. You didn’t risk your Shardbearers in such a\ncharge, not unless they had Plate.\n“Your Majesty,” an officer called to Elhokar, crossing the entryway. “We\nfound an oddity.”\nElhokar nodded for Adolin to take care of it, and—glad for the\ndistraction—he jogged over to meet up with the man. “What?”"

        "text": "found an oddity.”\nElhokar nodded for Adolin to take care of it, and—glad for the\ndistraction—he jogged over to meet up with the man. “What?”\n“Closed door to the palace garrison,” the man said, “rigged to lock from\nthe outside.”\nCurious. Adolin hiked after the man, passing an improvised triage station\nwhere a couple of surgeons knelt among painspren, seeing to men who had\nbeen wounded in the initial assault. They’d be far busier once the push\ndown the hallway was finished.\nTo the west of the entryway was the palace garrison, a large housing for\nsoldiers. A group of Azure’s men were studying the door—which had\nindeed been rigged to lock shut from the outside with a metal bar. Judging\nfrom the splintered wood, whatever was inside had tried to get out.\n“Open it,” Adolin said, summoning his Shardblade.\nThe soldiers cautiously lifted aside the bar, then eased open the door, one\nholding out some spheres for light. They didn’t find monsters, but a group\nof dirty men in Palace Guard uniforms. They had gathered at the noise\noutside, and at seeing Adolin, a few of them fell to their knees, letting out\nrelieved praises to the Almighty.\n“Your Highness?” said a younger Alethi man with captain’s knots on his\nshoulder. “Oh, Prince Adolin. It is you. Or is this … is this somehow a cruel\ndeception?”\n“It’s me,” Adolin said. “Sidin? Storms, man! I barely recognize you\nthrough that beard. What happened?”\n“Sir! Something’s wrong with the queen. First she killed that ardent, and\nthen executed Brightlord Kaves.…” He took a deep breath. “We’re traitors,\nsir.”\n“She culled the Guard, sir,” another man said. “Locked us in here\nbecause we wouldn’t obey. Practically forgot about us.”\nAdolin breathed out a relieved sigh. The fact that the entire Guard hadn’t\nsimply gone along with her … well, it lifted a burden from his shoulders,\none he hadn’t realized he’d been carrying.\n“We’re taking back the palace,” Adolin said. “Gather your men, Sidin,\nand meet up with the surgeons in the main entryway. They’ll look you over,\nget you some water, take your reports.”\n“Sir!” Sidin said. “If you’re storming the palace, we want to join you.”\nMany of the others nodded.\n“Join us? You’ve been locked in here for weeks, men! I don’t expect that\nyou’re fit for combat.”\n“Weeks?” Sidin said. “Surely it’s only been a few days, Brightlord.” He\nscratched at a beard that seemed to argue with that sentiment. “We’ve only\neaten … what, three times since being thrown in here?”\nSeveral of the others nodded.\n“Take them to the surgeons,” Adolin said to the scouts who had fetched\nhim. “But … get spears for the ones who claim to be strong enough to hold\nthem. Sidin, your men will be reserves. Don’t push yourselves too hard.”\nBack in the main entryway, Adolin passed a surgeon working on a man\nin a Palace Guard uniform.

To the surgeons, it didn’t matter if you were an\nenemy—they were helping any who needed their attention. That was fine,\nbut this man stared up with glazed eyes, and didn’t cry or groan like a\nwounded man should. He only whispered to himself.\nI know him too, Adolin realized, searching for the name. Dod? That’s it.\nThat’s what we called him, anyway.\nHe reported to the king what he’d found. Ahead, Azure’s men were\nmaking a final push to claim the hallway. They’d left dozens dying, staining\nthe carpet a darker shade of red. Adolin had the distinct sense that he could\nhear something. Over the din of the fighting, over the shouts of men\nechoing against the walls. A quiet voice that somehow cut to his soul.\nPassion. Sweet passion.\nThe Palace Guard finally relinquished the hallway, retreating through\ntwo sets of broad double doors at the other end. Those would lead to the\neastern gallery; the doors weren’t very defensible, but the enemy was\nobviously trying to buy as much time as possible.\nSome soldiers cleared bodies out of the way, preparing the way for\nAdolin and Elhokar to cut down the doors. The wood, however, started\nshaking before they could strike. Adolin backed up, presenting his Blade in\nWindstance by habit, ready to strike at what came through.\nThe door opened, revealing a glowing figure.\n“Stormfather…” Adolin whispered.\nKaladin shone with a powerful brilliance, his eyes beacons of blue,\nstreaming with Stormlight. He gripped a glowing metallic spear that was\neasily twelve feet long. Behind him, Skar and Drehy also glowed brilliantly,\nlooking little like the affable bridgemen who had protected Adolin on the\nShattered Plains.\n“The gallery is secure,” Kaladin said, Stormlight puffing from his lips.\n“The enemy you pushed back has fled up the steps. Your Majesty, I suggest\nyou send Azure’s men onto the Sunwalk to hold it.”\nAdolin ducked into the eastern gallery, followed by a flood of soldiers,\nAzure calling commands. Straight ahead was the entrance to the Sunwalk,\nan open-sided walkway. On it, Adolin was surprised to see not only guard\ncorpses, but three prominent bodies in blue. Kaladin, Skar, Drehy. Illusions?\n“Worked better than fighting them off,” Shallan said, stepping up to his\nside. “The flying ones are distracted by the fighting at the city wall, so they\nleft the moment they thought the bridgemen had fallen.”\n“We pushed another force of Palace Guards back into the monastery\nfirst,” Kaladin said, pointing. “We’re going to need an army to scrape them\nout.”\nAzure looked to Elhokar, who nodded, so she started giving the\ncommands. Shallan clicked her tongue, prodding at Adolin’s bandaged\nshoulder, but he assured her it was nothing serious.\nThe king strode through the gallery, then looked up the broad stairs.\n“Your Majesty?” Kaladin called.\n“I’m going to lead a force up to the royal chambers,” Elhokar said.\n“Someone needs to find out what happened to Aesudan, what happened to\nthis whole storming city.”"

His\nclothing seemed to droop, his feet settling more solidly on the ground. He\nsuddenly seemed a man again, and Adolin found that more relaxing.\n“I’ll go with him,” Kaladin said softly to Adolin, handing him the pack\nof emeralds, after picking out two brilliant ones for himself. “Take Skar and\nDrehy, and get Shallan to the Unmade.”\n“Sounds good,” Adolin said. He picked out some soldiers to go with the\nking: a platoon from the Wall Guard, a handful of the armsmen the\nhighlords had brought. And—after some thought—he added Sidin and half\na platoon of the men who had been imprisoned in the palace.\n“Those troops refused the queen’s orders,” Adolin said to Elhokar,\nnodding to Sidin. “They seem to have resisted the influence of whatever’s\ngoing on in here, and they’ll know the palace better than the Wall Guard.”\n“Excellent,” Elhokar said, then started up the steps. “Don’t wait for us. If\nBrightness Davar is successful, go right to Urithiru and bring our armies\nback.”\nAdolin nodded, then gave Kaladin a quick salute—tapping his wrists\ntogether with hands in fists. The Bridge Four salute. “Good luck,\nbridgeboy.”\nKaladin smiled, his silvery spear vanishing as he gave the salute back,\nthen hustled after the king. Adolin jogged over to Shallan, who was staring\nalong the Sunwalk. Azure had claimed it with her soldiers, but hadn’t\nadvanced onto the Oathgate platform beyond.\nAdolin rested his hand on Shallan’s shoulder.\n“They’re there,” she whispered. “Two of them, this time. Last night,\nAdolin … I had to run. The revel was getting inside my head.”\n“I’ve heard it,” he said, resummoning his Blade. “We’ll face it together.\nLike last time.”\nShallan took a deep breath, then summoned Pattern as a Shardblade. She\nheld the Blade before herself in a common stance.\n“Good form,” Adolin said.\n“I had a good teacher.”\nThey advanced across the Sunwalk, passing fallen enemy soldiers—and\na single dead Fused, pinned to a cleft in the rock by what appeared to be his\nown lance. Shallan lingered at the corpse, but Adolin pulled her along until\nthey reached the monastery proper. Azure’s soldiers advanced at his\ncommand, engaging Palace Guards here to secure a path toward the center.\nAs they waited, Adolin stepped up to the edge of the plateau and\nsurveyed the city. His home.\nIt was falling.\nThe nearest gate had been broken completely open, and parshmen\nflooded through it toward the palace. Others had taken the walls via ladder\ncrews, and those were pushing down into the city at other points, including\nnear the palace gardens.\nThat enormous stone monstrosity moved along the wall on the inside,\nreaching up and slapping at guard towers.

A large group of people in varied\ncostumes had surged down Talan Way, passing along one of the windblades.\nThe Cult of Moments? He couldn’t be certain what part they’d played, but\nparshmen were flooding the city in that direction as well.\nWe can fix this, Adolin thought. We can bring our armies in, hold the\npalace hill, push back to the walls. They had dozens of Shardbearers. They\nhad Bridge Four and other Surgebinders. They could save this city.\nHe just needed to get them here.\nSoon, Azure approached with a platoon of thirty men. “The pathway\ninward is secure, though a knot of the enemy still holds the very center. I’ve\nspared a few men to scour nearby buildings. It looks like the people you\nmentioned—the ones who were reveling last night—are slumbering inside.\nThey don’t move, even when we prod them.”\nAdolin nodded, then led the way toward the center of the plateau,\nShallan and Azure following. They passed battle lines of Azure’s soldiers,\nwho were holding the streets. He soon saw the main force of the enemy,\ncollected on a path between monastery buildings, barring the way to the\nOathgate’s control building.\nSpurred by the urgency of Kholinar’s predicament, Adolin took point\nand swept among the enemy, burning their eyes with his Blade. He broke\ntheir line, though one straggler almost got in a lucky strike. Skar,\nfortunately, seemed to appear out of nowhere; the bridgeman caught the\nblow with his shield, then rammed a spear through the guardsman’s chest.\n“How many is that I owe you now?” Adolin asked.\n“I wouldn’t think to keep count, Brightlord,” Skar said with a grin,\nglowing light puffing from his lips.\nDrehy joined them, and they chased the routed enemy past the King’s\nChapel, finally reaching the control building. Adolin had always known it as\nthe Circle of Memories, merely another part of the monastery. As Shallan\nhad warned, it was overgrown with a dark mass that pulsed and throbbed,\nlike a pitch-black heart. Dark veins spread from it like roots, pulsating in\ntime with the heart.\n“Storms…” Drehy whispered.\n“All right,” Shallan said, walking forward. “Guard this area. I’ll see what\nI can do.”\n84. The One You Can Save\nThe enemy makes another push toward Feverstone Keep. I wish we\nknew what it was that had them so interested in that area. Could they\nbe intent on capturing Rall Elorim?\n—From drawer 19-2, third topaz\nKaladin charged up the broad stairs, followed by some fifty soldiers.\nStormlight pulsed within him, lending a spring to each step. The Fused\nhad taken time to come attack him on the Sunwalk, and had left soon after\nShallan had created her ruse. He could only assume that the city assault was\nconsuming the enemy’s attention, which meant he might be able to use his\npowers without drawing immediate reprisal.\nElhokar led the way, brilliant Shardblade carried in a two-handed grip."

Elhokar\ndidn’t seem to care that each step took them farther from the bulk of their\narmy.\n“Up the stairs,” he said softly to Syl. “Check for an ambush on each\nfloor.”\n“Yessir, commander sir, Radiant sir,” she said, and zipped off. A moment\nlater she zipped back down. “Lots of men on the third floor, but they’re\nbacking away from the stairwell. Doesn’t look like an ambush.”\nKaladin nodded, then slowed Elhokar with a touch on the arm. “We have\na reception waiting,” Kaladin said. He pointed at a squad of soldiers. “It\nseems the king lost his guards somewhere. You’re now them. If we get into\ncombat, keep His Majesty from being surrounded.” He pointed at another\ngroup. “You men are … Beard?”\n“Yes, Kal?” the stocky guardsman said. He hesitated, then saluted. “Um,\nsir?” Behind him were Noro, Ved, Alaward, and Vaceslv … Kaladin’s entire\nsquad from the Wall Guard.\nNoro shrugged. “Without the captain, we don’t have a proper platoon\nleader. Figured we should stick with you.”\nBeard nodded and rubbed at the glyphward wrapping his right arm.\nFortune, it read.\n“Good to have you,” Kaladin said. “Try to keep me from being flanked,\nbut give me space if you can.”\n“Don’t crowd you,” Lieutenant Noro said, “and don’t let anyone else\ncrowd you either. Can do, sir.”\nKaladin looked to the king and nodded. The two of them took the last\nfew steps up to the landing to emerge into a broad stone hallway, carpeted\ndown the center but otherwise unornamented. Kaladin had expected the\npalace to be more lavish, but it appeared that even here—in the seat of their\npower—the Kholins preferred buildings that felt like bunkers. Funny, after\nhearing them complain that their fortresses on the Shattered Plains lacked\ncomfort.\nSyl was right. A platoon of enemy soldiers had formed up down the hall,\nholding halberds or crossbows, but seemed content to wait. Kaladin\nprepared Stormlight; he could paint the walls with a power that would cause\ncrossbow bolts to veer aside in their flight, but it was far from a perfect art.\nIt was the power he understood the least.\n“Do you not see me?” Elhokar bellowed. “Do you not know your\nmonarch? Are you so far consumed by the touch of the spren that you\nwould kill your own king?”\nStorms … those soldiers barely seemed to be breathing. At first they\ndidn’t move—then a few looked backward, down the hallway. Was that a\ndistant voice?\nThe palace soldiers immediately broke formation and retreated.

He didn’t have the troops to properly hold their retreat; all he could\ndo was post a pair of men at each intersection, with instructions to yell if\nthey saw someone coming down the cross hallways.\nThey passed a corridor lined with statues of the Heralds. Nine of them, at\nleast. One was missing. Kaladin sent Syl ahead to watch, but that left him\nfeeling even more exposed. Everyone but him seemed to know the way,\nwhich made sense, but it made him feel carried along on some sort of tide.\nThey finally reached the royal chambers, marked by a broad set of doors,\nopen and inviting. Kaladin stopped his men thirty feet from the opening,\nnear a corridor that split off to the left.\nEven from here, he could see that the chamber beyond the doors finally\ndisplayed some of the lavish ornamentation he had expected. Rich carpets,\ntoo much furniture, everything covered in embroidery or gilding.\n“There are soldiers down that smaller hallway to the left,” Syl said,\nzipping back to him. “There isn’t a single one in the room ahead, but …\nKaladin, she’s in there. The queen.”\n“I can hear her,” Elhokar said. “That’s her voice, singing.”\nI know that tune, Kaladin thought. Something about her soft song was\nfamiliar. He wanted to advise caution, but the king was already hurrying\nforward, a worried squad of men following.\nKaladin sighed, then arranged his remaining men; half stayed back to\nwatch their retreat, and the other half formed up at the left hallway to stare\ndown the Palace Guard. Storms. If this went wrong he’d have a bloodbath\non his hands, with the king trapped in the middle.\nStill, this was why they’d come up here. He followed the queen’s song\nand entered the room.\n* * *\nShallan stepped up to the dark heart. Even though she hadn’t studied human\nanatomy as much as she’d have liked—her father thought it unfeminine—in\nthe sunlight, she could easily see that it was the wrong shape.\nThis isn’t a human heart, she decided. Maybe it’s a parshman heart. Or,\nwell, a giant, dark violet spren in the shape of one, growing over the\nOathgate control building.\n“Shallan,” Adolin said. “We’re running out of time.”\nHis voice brought to her an awareness of the city around her. Of soldiers\nskirmishing only one street over. Of distant drums going quiet, one at a\ntime, as guard posts on the wall fell. Of smoke in the air, and a soft, high-\npitched roar that seemed the echoes of thousands upon thousands of people\nshouting in the chaos of a city being conquered.\nShe tried Pattern first, stabbing him into the heart as a Shardblade. The\nmass simply split around the Blade. She slashed with it, and the spren cut,\nthen sealed up behind. So. Time to try what she’d done in Urithiru.\nTrembling, Shallan closed her eyes and pressed her hand against the\nheart. It felt real, like warm flesh. Like in Urithiru, touching the thing let her\nsense it. Feel it. Know it.\nIt tried to sweep her away.\n* * *"

Know it.\nIt tried to sweep her away.\n* * *\nThe queen sat at a vanity beside the wall.\nShe was much as Kaladin had anticipated. Younger than Elhokar, with\nlong dark Alethi hair, which she was combing. Her song had fallen away to\na hum.\n“Aesudan?” Elhokar asked.\nShe looked away from the mirror, then smiled broadly. She had a narrow\nface, with prim lips painted a deep red. She rose from the seat and glided to\nhim. “Husband! So it was you I heard. You have returned at last? Victorious\nover our enemies, your father avenged?”\n“Yes,” Elhokar said, frowning. He moved to step toward her, but Kaladin\ngrabbed him by the shoulder and held him back.\nThe queen focused on Kaladin. “New bodyguard, dear one? Far too\nscruffy; you should have consulted me. You have an image to maintain.”\n“Where is Gav, Aesudan? Where is my son?”\n“He’s playing with friends.”\nElhokar looked to Kaladin, and gestured to the side with his chin. See\nwhat you can find, it seemed to say.\n“Keep alert,” Kaladin whispered, then began picking through the room.\nHe passed the remnants of lavish meals only partially eaten. Pieces of fruit\neach with a single bite taken out of them. Cakes and pastries. Candied\nmeats on sticks. It looked like it should have rotted, based on the\ndecayspren he noticed, but it hadn’t.\n“Dear one,” Elhokar said, keeping his distance from the queen, “we\nheard that the city has seen … trouble lately.”\n“One of my ardents tried to refound the Hierocracy. We really should\nkeep better watch on who joins them; not every man or woman is proper for\nservice.”\n“You had her executed.”\n“Of course. She tried to overthrow us.”\nKaladin picked around a pile of musical instruments of the finest wood,\nsitting in a heap.\nHere, Syl’s voice said in his mind. Across the room. Behind the dressing\nscreen.\nHe passed the balcony to his left. If he remembered right—though the\nstory had been told so often, he had heard a dozen differing versions—\nGavilar and the assassin had fallen off that ledge during their struggles.\n“Aesudan,” Elhokar said, his voice pained. He stepped forward,\nextending his hand. “You’re not well. Please, come with me.”\n“Not well?”\n“There’s an evil influence in the palace.”\n“Evil? Husband, what a fool you are at times.”\nKaladin joined Syl and glanced behind the dressing screen, which had\nbeen pushed back against the wall to section off a small cubby. Here a child\n—two or three years old—huddled and trembled, clutching a stuffed soldier.\nSeveral spren with soft red glows were picking at him like cremlings at a\ncorpse.

The boy tried to turn his head, and the spren pulled on the back of\nhis hair until he looked up, while others hovered in front of his face and\ntook horrific shapes, like horses with melting faces.\nKaladin reacted with swift, immediate rage. He growled, seizing the\nSylblade from the air, forming a small dagger from mist. He drove the\ndagger forward and caught one of the spren, pinning it to the wall’s wooden\npaneling. He had never known a Shardblade to cut a spren before, but this\nworked. The thing screamed in a soft voice, a hundred hands coming from\nits shape and scraping at the Blade, at the wall, until it seemed to rip into a\nthousand tiny pieces, then faded.\nThe other three red spren streaked away in a panic. In his hands, Kaladin\nfelt Syl tremble, then groan softly. He released her, and she took the shape\nof a small woman. “That was … that was terrible,” she whispered, floating\nover to land on his shoulder. “Did we … just kill a spren?”\n“The thing deserved it,” Kaladin said.\nSyl just huddled on his shoulder, wrapping her arms around herself.\nThe child sniffled. He was dressed in a little uniform. Kaladin glanced\nback at the king and queen—he’d lost track of their conversation, but they\nspoke in hissing, furious tones.\n“Oh, Elhokar,” the queen was saying. “You were ever so oblivious. Your\nfather had grand plans, but you … all you ever wanted to do was sit in his\nshadow. It was for the best that you went off to play war.”\n“So you could stay here and … and do this?” Elhokar said, waving\ntoward the palace.\n“I continued your father’s work! I found the secret, Elhokar. Spren,\nancient spren. You can bond with them!”\n“Bond…” Elhokar’s mouth worked, as if he couldn’t understand the very\nword he spoke.\n“Have you seen my Radiants?” Aesudan asked. She grinned. “The\nQueen’s Guard? I’ve done what your father could not. Oh, he found one of\nthe ancient spren, but he could never discover how to bond it. But I, I have\nsolved the riddle.”\nIn the dim light of the royal chambers, Aesudan’s eyes glittered. Then\nstarted to glow a deep red.\n“Storms!” Elhokar said, stepping back.\nTime to go. Kaladin reached down to try to pick up the child, but the boy\nscreamed and scrambled away from him. That, finally, drew the king’s\nattention. Elhokar rushed over, throwing aside the dressing screen. He\ngasped, then knelt beside his son.\nThe child, Gavinor, scooted away from his father, crying.\nKaladin looked back to the queen. “How long have you been planning\nthis?”\n“Planning for my husband’s return?”\n“I’m not talking to you. I’m talking to the thing beyond you.”\nShe laughed. “Yelig-nar serves me. Or do you speak of the Heart of the\nRevel? Ashertmarn has no will; he is merely a force of consumption,\nmindless, to be harnessed.”"

Kaladin couldn’t hear the\nwords, but the child stopped weeping. He looked up, blinked away tears,\nand finally let his father pick him up. Elhokar cradled the child, who in turn\nclutched his stuffed soldier. It wore blue armor.\n“Out,” Kaladin said.\n“But…” The king looked toward his wife.\n“Elhokar,” Kaladin said, gripping the king’s shoulder. “Be a hero to the\none you can save.”\nThe king met his eyes, then nodded, clutching the young child. He\nstarted toward the door, and Kaladin followed, keeping his eyes on the\nqueen.\nShe sighed loudly, stepping after them. “I feared this.”\nThey rejoined their soldiers, then began to retreat down the hallway.\nAesudan stopped in the doorway to the king’s chambers. “I have\noutgrown you, Elhokar. I have taken the gemstone into me, and have\nharnessed Yelig-nar’s power.” Something started to twist around her, a\nblack smoke, blown as if from an unseen wind.\n“Double time,” Kaladin said to his men, drawing in Stormlight. He could\nfeel it coming; he’d sensed where this would go the moment they’d started\nup the steps.\nIt was almost a relief when, at last, Aesudan shouted for her soldiers to\nattack.\n* * *\nGive it all to me, the voices whispered in Shallan’s mind. Give me your\npassion, your hunger, your longing, your loss. Surrender it. You are what\nyou feel.\nShallan swam in it, lost, like in the depths of the ocean. The voices beset\nher from all sides. When one whispered that she was pain, Shallan became a\nweeping girl, singing as she twisted a chain tight around a thick neck. When\nanother whispered that she was hunger, she became an urchin on the street,\nwearing rags for clothing.\nPassion. Fear. Enthusiasm. Boredom. Hatred. Lust.\nShe became a new person with every heartbeat. The voices seemed\nthrilled by this. They assaulted her, growing to a frenzy. Shallan was a\nthousand people in a moment.\nBut which one was her?\nAll of them. A new voice. Wit’s?\n“Wit!” she screamed, surrounded by snapping eels in a dark place. “Wit!\nPlease.”\nYou’re all of them, Shallan. Why must you be only one emotion? One set\nof sensations? One role? One life?\n“They rule me, Wit. Veil and Radiant and all the others. They’re\nconsuming me.”\nThen be ruled as a king is ruled by his subjects. Make Shallan so strong,\nthe others must bow.\n“I don’t know if I can!”\nThe darkness thrummed and surged.\nAnd then … withdrew?\nShallan didn’t feel as if she’d changed anything, but still the darkness\nretreated. She found herself kneeling on the cold stones outside the control\nbuilding. The enormous heart became sludge, then melted away, almost\nseeming to crawl, sending out runners of dark liquid before itself."

Drehy and Skar\nglowed nearby, looking grim, fresh blood on their clothing. They’d been\nfighting.\nShallan stood up on shaky feet. The small, circular structure in front of\nher seemed insignificant compared to the other monastery buildings, but it\nwas the key to everything.\n“This is going to be tricky, Azure,” Adolin said. “We’re going to have to\nfight back down into the city, push the enemy out. Storms, I hope my father\nhas our armies ready.”\nShallan blinked, dazed. She couldn’t help feeling she’d failed. That she\nhadn’t done anything.\n“The first transfer will be only the control building,” Adolin said. “After\nthat, she’ll swap the entire platform—buildings and all. We’ll want to move\nour army back into the palace before that happens.” Adolin turned,\nsurveying the path back. “What is taking the king so long?”\nShallan stepped into the control building. It looked much as the one\nshe’d discovered at the Shattered Plains—though better maintained, and its\ntile mosaics on the floor were of fanciful creatures. An enormous beast with\nclaws, and fur like a mink. Something that looked like a giant fish. On the\nwalls, lanterns shone with gemstones—and between them hung full-length\nmirrors.\nShallan walked toward the keyhole control device, summoning Pattern\nas a Blade. She studied him, then looked up at herself in one of the mirrors\nhanging on the wall.\nSomeone else stood in the mirror. A woman with black hair that fell to\nher waist. She wore archaic clothing, a sleeveless, flowing gown that was\nmore of a tunic, with a simple belted waist. Shallan touched her face. Why\nhad she put this illusion on?\nThe reflection didn’t mimic her motions, but pressed forward, raising\nhands against the glass. The reflected room faded and the figure distorted,\nand became a jet-black shadow with white holes for eyes.\nRadiant, the thing said, mouthing the words. My name is Sja-anat.

He was unpracticed with this power, and unfortunately,\nsome of the bolts still slammed into shields, even heads.\nKaladin growled, then drew in a deep breath of Stormlight, bursting\nalight—the glow of his skin shining on the walls and ceiling of the palace\nhallway.

At last, the captain of the rearguard\ncalled the final withdrawal, and the rest of Kaladin’s men rushed down the\nstairs. Only Noro’s squad lingered.\nSome of the queen’s soldiers began to test forward at him, so he dropped\nto the floor and started down the steps at a run. Beard and the rest of the\nsquad joined him, followed by the queen’s soldiers, unnaturally silent.\nUnfortunately, Kaladin heard something else echoing up the stairwell\nfrom down below. The sounds of men clashing, and of familiar singing.\nParshendi songs.\n“Rearguard!” Kaladin shouted. “Form up on the steps; orient toward the\nupper floor!”\nHis soldiers obeyed, turning and leveling spears and shields at the\ndescending enemy. Kaladin Lashed himself upward and twisted so that he\nhit the ceiling feet-first. He ducked and ran—passing over the heads of his\nmen in the high stairwell—until he reached the ground floor.\nThe first ranks of his soldiers clashed with parshman troops in the\neastern gallery.

They surged around Kaladin as—stunned—he lowered his\nspear.\nThe large, pillared hall became a scene of utter chaos. Azure’s soldiers\nrushed in from the Sunwalk, meeting the parshmen who came up the stairs\nfrom the back of the palace—they’d likely broken in through the gardens\nthere. The king held his son, standing amid a group of soldiers in the very\ncenter. Kaladin’s men managed to get down off the steps, and behind them\nrushed the Queen’s Guard.\nIt all churned into a melee. Battle lines disintegrated, and platoons\nshattered, men fighting alone or in pairs. It was a battlefield commander’s\nnightmare. Hundreds of men mixing and screaming and fighting and dying.\nKaladin saw them. All of them. Sah and the parshmen, fighting to keep\ntheir freedom. The guardsmen who had been rescued, fighting for their\nking. Azure’s Wall Guard, terrified as their city fell around them. The\nQueen’s Guard, convinced they were loyally following orders.\nIn that moment, Kaladin lost something precious. He’d always been able\nto trick himself into seeing a battle as us against them. Protect those you\nlove. Kill everyone else. But … but they didn’t deserve death.\nNone of them did.\nHe locked up. He froze, something that hadn’t happened to him since his\nfirst days in Amaram’s army. The Sylspear vanished in his fingers, puffing\nto mist. How could he fight? How could he kill people who were just doing\nthe best they could?\n“Stop!” he finally bellowed. “Stop it! Stop killing each other!”\nNearby, Sah rammed Beard through with a spear.\n“STOP! PLEASE!”\nNoro responded by running through Jali—one of the other parshmen\nKaladin had known. Ahead, Elhokar’s ring of guards fell, and a member of\nthe Queen’s Guard managed to ram the point of a halberd into the king’s\narm. Elhokar gasped, dropping his Shardblade from pained fingers, holding\nhis son close with his other arm.\nThe Queen’s Guardsman pulled back, eyes widening—as if seeing the\nking for the first time. One of Azure’s soldiers cut the guardsman down in\nhis moment of confusion.\nKaladin screamed, tears streaming from his eyes. He begged them to just\nstop, to listen.\nThey couldn’t hear him. Sah—gentle Sah, who had only wanted to\nprotect his daughter—died by Noro’s sword. Noro, in turn, got his head\nsplit by Khen’s axe.\nNoro and Sah fell beside Beard, whose dead eyes stared sightlessly—his\narm stretched out, glyphward soaking up his blood.\nKaladin slumped to his knees.

I foresaw this.\n—From drawer 30-20, a particularly small emerald\nAdolin shoved down the emotion of seeing Elhokar’s dead body. It was one\nof the first battlefield lessons his father had taught him.\nGrieve later.\nAdolin pulled Kaladin out along the Sunwalk while Skar and Drehy\nguarded their retreat, encouraging the last of the Wall Guard to run—or\nlimp—to safety.\nKaladin stumbled along. Though he didn’t appear wounded, he stared\nwith a glazed-over look. Those were the eyes of a man who bore the kinds\nof wounds you couldn’t fix with bandages.\nThey eventually poured out of the Sunwalk onto the Oathgate platform,\nwhere Azure’s soldiers held firm, her surgeons running to help the wounded\nwho had escaped the bloodbath in the eastern gallery. Skar and Drehy\ndropped down to the platform, guarding the way onto the Sunwalk, to\nprevent the Queen’s Guard or parshmen from following.\nAdolin stumbled to a stop. From this vantage he could see the city.\nStormfather.\nTens of thousands of parshmen flooded in through the broken gates or\nacross the nearby sections of wall. Figures glowing with dark light zipped\nthrough the air. Those seemed to be gathering in formations nearby, perhaps\nfor an assault on the Oathgate platform.\nAdolin took it all in, and admitted the terrible truth. His city was lost.\n“All forces, hold the platform,” he heard himself saying. “But pass the\nword. I’m going to take us to Urithiru.”\n“Sir!” a soldier said. “Civilians are crowding the base of the platform,\ntrying to get up the steps.”\n“Let them!” Adolin shouted. “Get as many people up here as you can.\nHold against any enemy who tries to reach the platform top, but don’t\nengage them if they don’t press. We’re abandoning the city. Anyone not on\nthe platform in ten minutes will be left behind!”\nAdolin hurried toward the control building. Kaladin followed, dazed.\nAfter what he’s been through, Adolin thought, I wouldn’t have expected that\nanything could faze him. Not even Elhokar’s …\nStorms. Grieve later.\nAzure stood guard in the doorway to the control building, holding the\npack full of gemstones. Hopefully, those would be enough to get everyone\nto safety.\n“Brightness Davar told me to clear everyone else out,” the highmarshal\nsaid. “Something’s wrong with the device.”\nAdolin cursed under his breath and stepped inside. Shallan knelt on the\nground before a mirror, looking at herself. Behind, Kaladin stepped in, then\nsettled down on the floor, placing his back to the wall.\n“Shallan,” Adolin said. “We need to go. Now.”\n“But—”\n“The city has fallen. Transfer the entire platform, not just the control\nbuilding. We need to get as many people as we can to safety.”\n“My men on the wall!” Azure said.\n“They’re dead or routed,” Adolin said, gritting his teeth. “I don’t like it\nany more than you do.”\n“The king—”\n“The king is dead.

I’m ordering our\nretreat, Azure.” Adolin locked gazes with the woman. “We gain nothing by\ndying here.”\nShe drew her lips to a line, but didn’t argue further.\n“Adolin,” Shallan whispered, “the heart was a trick. I didn’t chase it off\n—it left on purpose. I think … I think the Voidbringers intentionally left\nKaladin and his men alone after only a brief fight. They let us come here\nbecause the Oathgate is trapped.”\n“How do you know?” Adolin asked.\nShallan cocked her head. “I’m speaking to her.”\n“Her?”\n“Sja-anat. The Taker of Secrets. She says that if we engage the device,\nwe’ll be caught in a disaster.”\nAdolin took a deep breath.\n“Do it anyway,” he said.\n* * *\nDo it anyway.\nShallan understood the implication. How could they trust an ancient\nspren of Odium? Perhaps Shallan really had driven the black heart away,\nand—in a panic to keep the humans from escaping—Sja-anat was now\nstalling.\nShallan looked away from the pleading figure in the mirror. The others\ncouldn’t see her—she’d confirmed this with Azure already.\n“Pattern?” she whispered. “What do you think?”\n“Mmmm…” he said quietly. “Lies. So many lies. I don’t know, Shallan.\nI cannot tell you.”\nKaladin slumped by the wall, staring sightlessly, as if he were dead\ninside. She couldn’t recall ever seeing him in such a state.\n“Get ready.” Shallan stood up, summoning Pattern as a Blade.\nTrust is not mine, said the figure in the mirror. You will not give my\nchildren a home. Not yet.\nShallan pushed the Blade into the lock. It melded to match Pattern’s\nshape.\nI will show you, Sja-anat said. I will try. My promise is not strong, for I\ncannot know. But I will try.\n“Try what?” Shallan asked.\nTry not to kill you.\nWith those words haunting her, Shallan engaged the Oathgate.\n86. That Others May Stand\nMy spren claims that recording this will be good for me, so here I go.\nEveryone says I will swear the Fourth Ideal soon, and in so doing,\nearn my armor. I simply don’t think that I can. Am I not supposed to\nwant to help people?\n—From drawer 10-12, sapphire\nDalinar Kholin stood at attention, hands behind his back, one wrist gripping\nthe other. He could see so far from his balcony at Urithiru—but it was\nendless miles of nothing. Clouds and rock. So much and so little, all at\nonce.\n“Dalinar,” Navani said, stepping up and resting her hands on his arm.\n“Please. At least come inside.”\nThey thought he was sick. They thought his collapse on the Oathgate\nplatform had been caused by heart troubles, or fatigue. The surgeons had\nsuggested rest. But if he stopped standing up straight, if he let it bow him\ndown, he worried the memories would crush him."

But if he stopped standing up straight, if he let it bow him\ndown, he worried the memories would crush him.\nThe memories of what he’d done at the Rift.\nThe crying voices of children, begging for mercy.\nHe forced his emotions down. “What news,” he said, embarrassed by\nhow his voice trembled.\n“None,” Navani said. “Dalinar…”\nWord had come from Kholinar via spanreed, one that somehow still\nworked. An assault on the palace, an attempt to reach the Oathgate.\nOutside, the gathered Kholin, Aladar, and Roion armies clogged one of\nUrithiru’s Oathgate platforms, waiting to be taken to Kholinar to join the\nbattle. But nothing happened. Time seeped away. It had been four hours\nsince the first communication.\nDalinar closed his mouth, eyes ahead, and stared at the expanse. At\nattention, like a soldier. That was how he would wait. Even though he’d\nnever really been a soldier. He’d commanded men, ordered recruits to stand\nin line, inspected ranks. But he himself … he’d skipped all of that. He’d\nwaged war in a bloodthirsty riot, not a careful formation.\nNavani sighed, patting him on the arm, then returned to their rooms to sit\nwith Taravangian and a small collection of scribes and highprinces.\nAwaiting news from Kholinar.\nDalinar stood in the breeze, wishing he could empty his mind, rid\nhimself of memories. Go back to being able to pretend he was a good man.\nProblem was, he’d given in to a kind of fancy, one everyone told about him.\nThey said the Blackthorn had been a terror on the battlefield, but still\nhonest. Dalinar Kholin, he would fight you fair, they said.\nEvi’s cries, and the tears of murdered children, spoke the truth. Oh …\noh, Almighty above. How could he live with this pain? So fresh, restored\nanew? But why pray? There was no Almighty watching. If there had been—\nand if he’d had a shred of justice to him—Honor would have long ago\npurged this world of the fraud that was Dalinar Kholin.\nAnd I had the gall to condemn Amaram for killing one squad of men to\ngain a Shardblade. Dalinar had burned an entire city for less. Thousands\nupon thousands of people.\n“Why did you bond me?” Dalinar whispered to the Stormfather.\n“Shouldn’t you have picked a man who was just?”\nJust? Justice is what you brought to those people.\n“That was not justice. That was a massacre.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled. I have burned and broken cities myself. I can\nsee … yes, I see a difference now. I see pain now. I did not see it before the\nbond.\nWould Dalinar lose his bond now, in exchange for making the\nStormfather increasingly aware of human morality? Why had these cursed\nmemories returned? Couldn’t he have continued for a little longer without\nthem? Long enough to forge the coalition, to prepare the defense of\nhumankind?\nThat was the coward’s route. Wishing for ignorance.

The coward’s route\nhe’d obviously taken—though he could not yet remember his visit to the\nNightwatcher, he knew what he’d asked for. Relief from this awful burden.\nThe ability to lie, to pretend he had not done such horrible things.\nHe turned away and walked back into his rooms. He didn’t know how\nhe’d face this—bear this burden—but today, he needed to focus on the\nsalvation of Kholinar. Unfortunately, he couldn’t make battle plans until he\nknew more about the city’s situation.\nHe entered the common room, where the core of his government had\ngathered. Navani and the others sat on some couches around the spanreed,\nwaiting. They’d laid out battle maps of Kholinar, talked over strategies, but\nthen … hours had passed with no news.\nIt felt so frustrating to just sit here, ignorant. And it left Dalinar with too\nmuch time to think. To remember.\nInstead of sitting with the others, Taravangian had taken his normal\nplace: a seat before the warming fabrial in the corner. Legs aching and back\nstiff, Dalinar walked over and finally let himself sit, groaning softly as he\ntook the seat beside Taravangian.\nBefore them, a bright red ruby glowed with heat, replacing a fire with\nsomething safer but far more lifeless.\n“I’m sorry, Dalinar,” Taravangian finally said. “I’m sure news will come\nsoon.”\nDalinar nodded. “Thank you for what you did when the Azish came to\ntour the tower.”\nThe Azish had arrived yesterday for an initial tour, but Dalinar had been\nrecovering from the sudden return of his memories. Well … truth was, he\nwas still recovering. He’d welcomed them, then retired, as Taravangian had\noffered to lead the tour. Navani said the Azish dignitaries had all been\ncharmed by the elderly king, and planned to return soon for a more in-depth\nmeeting about the possibility of a coalition.\nDalinar leaned forward, staring at the heating fabrial. Behind, Aladar and\nGeneral Khal conversed—for probably the hundredth time—on how to\nrecover the Kholinar walls, if they were lost by the time the Oathgate\nstarted working.\n“Have you ever come to the sudden realization,” Dalinar said softly,\n“that you’re not the man everyone thinks you are?”\n“Yes,” Taravangian whispered. “More daunting, however, are similar\nmoments: when I realize I’m not the man I think of myself as being.”\nStormlight swirled in the ruby. Churning. Trapped. Imprisoned.\n“We spoke once,” Dalinar said, “of a leader forced to either hang an\ninnocent man or free three murderers.”\n“I remember.”\n“How does one live after making a decision like that? Particularly if you\neventually discover you made the wrong choice?”\n“This is the sacrifice, isn’t it?” Taravangian said softly. “Someone must\nbear the responsibility. Someone must be dragged down by it, ruined by it.\nSomeone must stain their soul so others may live.”\n“But you’re a good king, Taravangian. You didn’t murder your way to\nyour throne.”\n“Does it matter? One wrongly imprisoned man? One murder in an alley"

Society offers us up to trudge through dirty water\nso others may be clean.” He closed his eyes. “Someone has to fall, that\nothers may stand.”\nThe words were similar to things Dalinar had said, and thought, for\nyears. Yet Taravangian’s version was somehow twisted, lacking hope or life.\nDalinar leaned forward, stiff, feeling old. The two didn’t speak for a long\nperiod until the others started to stir. Dalinar stood, anxious.\nThe spanreed was writing. Navani gasped, safehand to her lips. Teshav\nturned pale, and May Aladar sat back in her seat, looking sick.\nThe spanreed cut off abruptly and dropped to the page, rolling as it\nlanded.\n“What?” Dalinar demanded. “What does it say?”\nNavani looked to him, then glanced away. Dalinar shared a look with\nGeneral Khal, then Aladar.\nDread settled on Dalinar like a cloak. Blood of my fathers. “What does it\nsay?” he pled.\n“The … the capital has fallen, Dalinar,” Navani whispered. “The ardent\nreports that Voidbringer forces have seized the palace. He … he cut off after\nonly a few sentences. It looks like they found him, and…”\nShe squeezed her eyes shut.\n“The team you sent,” Teshav continued, “has apparently failed,\nBrightlord.” She swallowed. “The remnants of the Wall Guard have been\ncaptured and imprisoned. The city has fallen. There is no word on the king,\nPrince Adolin, or the Radiants. Brightlord … the message cuts off there.”\nDalinar sank back down into his chair.\n“Almighty above,” Taravangian whispered, grey eyes reflecting the glow\nof the heating fabrial. “I am so, so sorry, Dalinar.”\n87. This Place\nGood night, dear Urithiru. Good night, sweet Sibling. Good night,\nRadiants.\n—From drawer 29-29, ruby\nThe Oathgate’s control building shook like it had been hit by a boulder.\nAdolin stumbled, then fell to his knees.\nThe shaking was followed by a distinct ripping sound, and a blinding\nflash of light.\nHis stomach lurched.\nHe fell through the air.\nShallan screamed somewhere nearby.\nAdolin struck a hard surface, and the impact was so jarring that he rolled\nto the side. That caused him to tumble off the edge of a white stone\nplatform.\nHe fell into something that gave way beneath him. Water? No, it didn’t\nfeel right. He twisted in it—not a liquid, but beads. Thousands upon\nthousands of glass beads, each smaller than a Stormlight sphere.\nAdolin thrashed, panicked as he sank. He was dying! He was going to\ndie and suffocate in this sea of endless beads.

He coughed, feeling that\nhe had been drowning, though he’d gotten only a few beads in his mouth.\nStormfather! He groaned, looking around. The sky overhead was wrong.\nPitch-black, it was streaked with strange clouds that seemed to stretch\nforever into the distance—like roads in the sky. They led toward a small,\ndistant sun.\nThe ocean of beads extended in every direction, and tiny lights hovered\nabove them—thousands upon thousands, like candle flames. Shallan\nstepped over, kneeling beside him. Nearby, Kaladin was standing up,\nshaking himself. This circular stone platform was like an island in the ocean\nof beads, roughly where the control building had been.\nHovering in the air were two enormous spren—they looked like\nstretched-out versions of people, and stood some thirty feet tall, like\nsentinels. One was pitch-black in coloring, the other red. He thought them\nstatues at first, but their clothing rippled in the air, and they shifted, one\nturning eyes down to look at him.\n“Oh, this is bad,” someone said nearby. “So very, very bad.”\nAdolin looked and found the speaker to be a creature in a stiff black\ncostume, with a robe that seemed—somehow—to be made of stone. In\nplace of its head was a shifting, changing ball of lines, angles, and\nimpossible dimensions.\nAdolin jumped to his feet, scrambling back. He almost collided with a\nyoung woman with blue-white skin, pale as snow, wearing a filmy dress that\nrippled in the wind. Another spren stood beside her, with ashen brown\nfeatures that seemed to be made of tight cords, the thickness of hair. She\nwore ragged clothing, and her eyes had been scratched out, like a canvas\nthat someone had taken a knife to.\nAdolin looked around, counting them. Nobody else was here on the\nlanding. Those two enormous spren in the sky, and the three smaller ones on\nthe platform. Adolin, Shallan, Kaladin, and Azure.\nIt seemed the Oathgate had only taken those who had been inside the\ncontrol building. But where had it taken them?\nAzure looked up at the sky. “Damnation,” she said softly. “I hate this\nplace.”\nTHE END OF\nPart Three\nI-7. Envoy\nOdium’s grand purpose for Venli meant turning her into a showpiece.\n“Then, the humans waged a war of extermination against us,” she told\nthe assembled crowd. “My sister tried to negotiate, to explain that we had\nno blame for the assassination of their king. They would not listen. They\nsaw us only as slaves to be dominated.”\nThe wagon upon which she stood wasn’t a particularly inspiring dais, but\nit was better than the pile of boxes she’d used in the last town. At least her\nnew form—envoyform—was tall, the tallest she’d ever worn. It was a form\nof power, and brought strange abilities, primarily the ability to speak and\nunderstand all languages.\nThat made it perfect for instructing the crowds of Alethi parshmen.\n“They fought for years to exterminate us,” she said to Command. “They"

They worked to\ncrush us, lest we inspire a revolution!”\nThe people gathered around the wagon bore thick lines of marbling—of\nred and either black or white. Venli’s own white and red was far more\ndelicate, with intricate swirls.\nShe continued, speaking triumphantly to the Rhythm of Command,\ntelling these people—as she’d told many others—her story. At least the\nversion of it that Odium had instructed her to tell.\nShe told them she’d personally discovered new spren to bond, creating a\nform that would summon the Everstorm. The story left out that Ulim had\ndone much of the work, giving her the secrets of stormform. Odium\nobviously wanted to paint the listeners as a heroic group, with Venli their\nbrave leader. The listeners were to be the foundation myth of his growing\nempire: the last of the old generation, who had fought bravely against the\nAlethi, then sacrificed themselves to free their enslaved brothers and sisters.\nHauntingly, the narrative said that Venli’s people were now extinct, save\nherself.\nThe former slaves listened, rapt by her narrative. She told it well; she\nshould, given how often she’d related it these last weeks. She ended with\nthe call to action, as specifically instructed.\n“My people have passed, joining the eternal songs of Roshar,” she said.\n“The day now belongs to you. We had named ourselves ‘listeners’ because\nof the songs we heard. These are your heritage, but you are not to merely\nlisten, but sing. Adopt the rhythms of your ancestors and build a nation\nhere! You must work. Not for the slavers who once held your minds, but for\nthe future, for your children! And for us. Those who died that you might\nexist.”\nThey cheered to the Rhythm of Excitement. That was good to hear, even\nif it was an inferior rhythm. Venli heard something better now: new,\npowerful rhythms that accompanied forms of power.\nYet … hearing those old rhythms awakened something in her. A memory.\nShe put her hand to the pouch at her belt.\nHow like the Alethi these people act, she thought. She had found humans\nto be … stern. Angry. Always walking about with their emotions worn\nopenly, prisoners to what they felt. These former slaves were similar. Even\ntheir jokes were Alethi, often biting toward those to whom they were\nclosest.\nAt the conclusion of her speech, an unfamiliar Voidspren ushered the\npeople back to work. She’d learned there were three levels in the hierarchy\nof Odium’s people. There were these common singers, who wore the\nordinary forms Venli’s people had used. Then there were those called\nRegals, like herself, who were distinguished by forms of power—created by\nbonding one of several varieties of Voidspren. At the top were the Fused—\nthough she had trouble placing spren like Ulim and others.

They obviously\noutranked the common singers, but what of the Regals?\nShe saw no humans in this town; those had been rounded up or chased\noff. She’d overheard some Fused saying that human armies still fought in\nwestern Alethkar, but this eastern section was completely singer controlled\n—remarkable, considering how the humans greatly outnumbered the\nsingers. The Alethi collapse was due in part to the Everstorm, in part to the\narrival of the Fused, and in part to the fact that the Alethi had repeatedly\nconscripted eligible men for their wars.\nVenli settled down on the back of the cart, and a femalen singer brought\nher a cup of water, which she took gladly. Proclaiming yourself as the\nsavior of an entire people was thirsty work.\nThe singer woman lingered. She wore an Alethi dress, with the left hand\ncovered up. “Is your story really true?”\n“Of course it is,” Venli said to Conceit. “You doubt?”\n“No, of course not! It’s just … it’s hard to imagine. Parshmen fighting.”\n“Call yourselves singers, not parshmen.”\n“Yes. Um, of course.” The femalen held her hand to her face, as if\nembarrassed.\n“Speak to the rhythms to express apology,” Venli said. “Use\nAppreciation to thank someone for correction, or Anxiety to highlight your\nfrustration. Consolation if you are truly contrite.”\n“Yes, Brightness.”\nOh, Eshonai. They have so far to go.\nThe woman scampered away. That lopsided dress looked ridiculous.\nThere was no reason to distinguish between the genders except in\nmateform. Humming to Ridicule, Venli hopped down, then walked through\nthe town, head high. The singers wore mostly workform or nimbleform,\nthough a few—like the femalen who had brought the water—wore\nscholarform, with long hairstrands and angular features.\nShe hummed to Fury. Her people had spent generations struggling to\ndiscover new forms, and here these people were given a dozen different\noptions? How could they value that gift without knowing the struggle?\nThey gave Venli deference, bowing like humans, as she approached the\ntown’s mansion. She had to admit there was something very satisfying\nabout that.\n“What are you so smug about?” Rine demanded to Destruction when\nVenli stepped inside. The tall Fused waited by the window, hovering—as\nalways—a few feet off the ground, his cloak hanging down and resting on\nthe floor.\nVenli’s sense of authority evaporated. “I can’t help but feel as if I’m\namong babes, here.”\n“If they are babes, you are a toddler.”\nA second Fused sat on the floor amid the chairs. That one never spoke.\nVenli didn’t know the femalen’s name, and found her constant grin and\nunblinking eyes … upsetting.\nVenli joined Rine by the window, looking out at the singers who\npopulated the village. Working the land. Farming. Their lives might not\nhave changed much, but they had their songs back. That meant everything.\n“We should bring them human slaves, Ancient One,” Venli said to"

If you really want\nthese villages to supply your armies, they’ll need more workers.”\nRine glanced at her. She’d found that if she spoke to him respectfully—\nand if she spoke in the ancient tongue—her words were less likely to be\ndismissed.\n“There are those among us who agree with you, child,” Rine said.\n“You do not?”\n“No. We will need to watch the humans constantly. At any moment, any\nof them could manifest powers from the enemy. We killed him, and yet he\nfights on through his Surgebinders.”\nSurgebinders. Foolishly, the old songs spoke highly of them. “How can\nthey bind spren, Ancient One?” she asked to Subservience. “Humans\ndon’t … you know…”\n“So timid,” he said to Ridicule. “Why is mentioning gemhearts so\ndifficult?”\n“They are sacred and personal.” Listener gemhearts were not gaudy or\nostentatious, like those of greatshells. Clouded white, almost the color of\nbone, they were beautiful, intimate things.\n“They’re a part of you,” Rine said. “The dead bodies taboo, the refusal to\ntalk of gemhearts—you’re as bad as those out there, walking around with\none hand covered.”\nWhat? That was unfair. She attuned Fury.\n“It … shocked us when it first happened,” Rine eventually said.\n“Humans don’t have gemhearts. How could they bond spren? It was\nunnatural. Yet somehow, their bond was more powerful than ours. I always\nsaid the same thing, and believe it even more strongly now: We must\nexterminate them. Our people will never be safe on this world as long as the\nhumans exist.”\nVenli felt her mouth grow dry. Distantly, she heard a rhythm. The\nRhythm of the Lost? An inferior one. It was gone in a moment.\nRine hummed to Conceit, then turned and barked a command to the\ncrazy Fused. She scrambled to her feet and loped after him as he floated out\nthe door. He was probably going to confer with the town’s spren. He’d give\norders and warnings, which he usually only did right before they left one\ntown for another. Despite having unpacked her things, working under the\nassumption she’d be here for the night, now Venli suspected they would\nsoon be moving on.\nShe went to her room on the second floor of the mansion. As usual, the\nluxury of these buildings astounded her. Soft beds you felt you would sink\ninto. Fine woodworking. Blown-glass vases and crystal sconces on the\nwalls for holding spheres. She’d always hated the Alethi, who had acted like\nthey were benevolent parents encountering wild children to be educated.\nThey had pointedly ignored the culture and advancements of Venli’s people,\neyeing only the hunting grounds of the greatshells that they—because of\ntranslation errors—decided must be the listeners’ gods.\nVenli felt at the beautiful swirls in the glass of a wall sconce.

Whenever she encountered\nthings like this, she had to remind herself forcefully that the Alethi being\ntechnologically superior did not make them culturally superior. They’d\nsimply had access to more resources. Now that the singers had access to\nartform, they would be able to create works like this too.\nBut still … it was so beautiful. Could they really exterminate the people\nwho had created such beautiful and delicate swirls in the glass? The\ndecorations reminded her of her own pattern of marbling.\nThe pouch at her waist started vibrating. She wore a listener’s leather\nskirt below a tight shirt, topped with a looser overshirt. Part of Venli’s place\nwas to show the singers that someone like them—not some distant,\nfearsome creature from the past—had brought the storms and freed the\nsingers.\nHer eyes lingered on the sconce, and then she dumped out her pouch on\nthe room’s stumpweight desk. Spheres bounced free, along with a larger\nnumber of uncut gemstones, which her people had used instead.\nThe little spren rose from where it had been hiding among the light. It\nlooked like a comet when it moved, though sitting still—as it did now—it\nonly glowed like a spark.\n“Are you one of them?” she asked softly. “The spren that move in the\nsky some nights?”\nIt pulsed, sending off a ring of light that dissipated like glowing smoke.\nThen it began zipping through the room, looking at things.\n“The room isn’t any different from the last one you looked at,” she said\nto Amusement.\nThe spren zipped to the wall sconce, where it let off a pulse in awe, then\nmoved to the identical one on the opposite side of the door.\nVenli moved to gather her clothing and writings from the drawers in the\ndresser. “I don’t know why you stay with me. It can’t be comfortable in that\nbag.”\nThe spren zipped past her, looking in the drawer that she’d opened.\n“It’s a drawer,” she said.\nThe spren peeked out, then pulsed in a quick blinking succession.\nThat’s Curiosity, she thought, recognizing the rhythm. She hummed it to\nherself as she packed her things, then hesitated. Curiosity was an old\nrhythm. Like … Amusement, which she’d attuned moments ago. She could\nhear the normal rhythms again.\nShe looked at the little spren. “Is this your doing?” she demanded to\nIrritation.\nIt shrank, but pulsed to Resolve.\n“What are you hoping to accomplish? Your kind betrayed us. Go find a\nhuman to bother.”\nIt shrank further. Then pulsed to Resolve again.\nBother. Down below, the door slammed open. Rine was back already.\n“In the pouch,” she hissed to Command. “Quickly.”\nI-8.

Mem\nThere was art to doing laundry.\nSure, everyone knew the basics, just like every child could hum a tune.\nBut did they know how to relax the fibers of a stubborn seasilk dress by\nreturning it to a warm brine, then restore its natural softness by rinsing it\nand brushing with the grain? Could they spot the difference between a\nmineral dye from Azir and a floral dye from the Veden slopes? You used\ndifferent soaps for each one.\nMem toiled at her canvas—which was, in this case, a pair of vivid red\ntrousers. She scooped some powder soap—hog fat based, mixed with fine\nabrasive—and rubbed at a stain on the leg. She wetted the trousers again,\nthen with a fine brush she worked in the soap.\nOil stains were challenging enough, but this man had gotten blood on the\nsame spot. She had to get the stain out without fading that fine Mycalin red\n—they got it from a slug on the shores of the Purelake—or ruining the\ncloth. Mraize did like his clothing to look sharp.\nMem shook her head. What was this stain? She had to go through four\nsoaps, then try some of her drying powder, before she got it to budge, and\nthen she moved on to the rest of the suit. Hours passed. Clean this spot,\nrinse that shirt. Hang it up for all to see. She didn’t notice the time until the\nother Veden washwomen started to leave in clumps, returning to their\nhomes, some of which were empty and cold, their husbands and sons dead\nin the civil war.\nThe need for clean clothing outlived disasters. The end of the world\ncould come, but that would only mean more bloodstains to wash. Mem\nfinally stepped back before her drying racks, hands on hips, basking in the\naccomplishment of a day’s work well done.\nDrying her hands, Mem went to check on her new assistant, Pom, who\nwas washing underclothes. The dark-skinned woman was obviously of\nmixed blood, both Easterner and Westerner. She was finishing an undershirt,\nand didn’t say anything as Mem stepped up beside her.\nStorms, why hasn’t anyone snatched her up? Mem thought as the\ngorgeous woman rubbed the shirt, then dunked it, then rubbed it again.\nWomen like Pom didn’t usually end up as washgirls, though she did tend to\nstare daggers at any man who got too close. Maybe that was it.\n“Well done,” Mem said. “Hang that to dry and help me gather the rest of\nthis.” They piled clothing in baskets, then made the short hike through the\ncity.\nVedenar still smelled like smoke to Mem. Not the good smoke of\nbakeries, but rather of the enormous pyres that had burned outside on the\nplain. Her employer lived near the markets, in a large townhome beside\nsome rubble—a lingering reminder of when siege weapons had rained\nboulders upon Vedenar.\nThe two washwomen passed guards at the front and headed up the steps.\nMem insisted on not using the servants’ entrance. Mraize was one of the\nfew who humored her.\n“Keep close,” she said to Pom, who dallied once they were inside. They\nhurried down a long, unornamented corridor, then up a staircase."

They\nhurried down a long, unornamented corridor, then up a staircase.\nPeople said that servants were invisible. Mem had never found that to be\ntrue, particularly around people like Mraize. Not only did the house steward\nnotice if someone so much as moved a candlestick, Mraize’s friends were\nthe type who kept careful track of everyone near them. Two of them stood\nin a doorway Mem passed, a man and woman speaking quietly. Both wore\nswords, and though they didn’t interrupt their conversation as the\nwashwomen passed, they watched.\nMraize’s quarters were at the top of a staircase. He wasn’t there today—\nhe appeared on occasion to drop off dirty clothing, then gallivanted off\nsomeplace to find new types of crem to stain his shirts. Mem and Pom went\ninto his den first—he kept his evening jackets there.\nPom froze in the doorway.\n“Stop dallying,” Mem reminded her, covering a smile. After stark, empty\nhallways and stairwells, this overstuffed den was a little overwhelming.\nShe’d marveled too, her first time here. A mantel covered in curiosities,\neach in its own glass display. Deep rugs from Marat. Five paintings of the\nfinest skill, each of a different Herald.\n“You were right,” Pom said from behind.\n“Of course I was right,” Mem said, setting down her basket in front of\nthe corner wardrobe. “Mraize—remember, he doesn’t want to be called\n‘master’—is of the finest and most refined taste. He employs only the best\nof—”\nShe was interrupted by a ripping sound.\nIt was a sound that inspired terror. The sound of a seam splitting, or of a\ndelicate chemise tearing as it caught on part of a washtub. It was the sound\nof disaster incarnate. Mem turned to find her new assistant standing on a\nchair, attacking one of Mraize’s paintings with a knife.\nA piece of Mem’s brain stopped working. A whine escaped from the\nback of her throat and her vision grew dark.\nPom was … she was destroying one of Mraize’s paintings.\n“I’ve been looking for that,” Pom said, stepping back and putting hands\non hips, still standing on the chair.\nTwo guards burst into the room, perhaps drawn by the noise. They\nlooked at Pom and their jaws dropped. In turn, she flipped her knife about in\nher hand and pointed it threateningly at the men.\nThen, horror of horrors, Mraize himself appeared behind the soldiers,\nwearing an evening jacket and slippers. “What is this ruckus?”\nSo refined. Yes, his face looked like it had seen the wrong side of a\nsword a couple of times. But he had exquisite taste in clothing and—of\ncourse—in garment-care professionals.\n“Ah!” he said, noticing Pom. “Finally! The masterpiece of the Oilsworn\nwas all it took, was it? Excellent!” Mraize shoved out the confused guards,\nthen pulled the door shut.

She\npulled open the door.\n“I know where Talenelat is,” Mraize said.\nPom froze.\n“Yes … let’s have that drink, shall we?” Mraize asked. “My babsk has\nbeen eager to speak with you.” He glanced at Mem. “Is that my Azish\ncavalrylord’s suit?”\n“Um … yes…”\n“You got the aether out of it?”\n“The … what?”\nHe strode over and pulled the red trousers out of the basket to inspect\nthem. “Mem, you are an absolute genius. Not every hunter carries a spear,\nand this is proof indeed. Go to Condwish and tell him I approve a three-\nfiremark bonus for you.”\n“Th-thank you, Mraize.”\n“Go collect your bonus, and leave,” Mraize said. “Note that you will\nneed to find a new washgirl to help you, after today.”\nI-9. True Labor Begins\nEshonai would have loved this, Venli thought as she flew hundreds of feet in\nthe air. Rine and the other Fused carried her by means of linked harnesses.\nIt made her feel like a sack of grain being hauled to market, but it gave her\nquite an amazing view.\nEndless hills of stone. Patches of green, often in the shadows of hillsides.\nThick forests snarled with undergrowth to present a unified front against the\nstorms.\nEshonai would have been thrilled; she’d have begun drawing maps,\ntalking about the places she could go.\nVenli, on the other hand, spent most of these trips feeling sick to her\nstomach. Normally she didn’t have to suffer for long; towns were close\ntogether here in Alethkar. Yet today, her ancestors flew her past many\noccupied towns without stopping.\nEventually, what first appeared to be another ridge of stones resolved\ninto the walls of a large city, easily twice the size of one of the domes at the\nShattered Plains.\nStone buildings and reinforced towers. Marvels and wonders. It had been\nyears since she’d seen Kholinar—only that once, when they’d executed\nKing Gavilar. Now, smoke rose in patches throughout the city, and many of\nthe guard towers had been shattered. The city gates lay broken. Kholinar, it\nseemed, had been conquered.\nRine and his companions zipped through the air, raising fists toward\nother Fused. They surveyed the city, then soared out beyond the wall and\nlanded near a bunker outside the city. They waited as Venli undid her\nharness, then lifted into the air again just high enough that the bottoms of\ntheir long cloaks brushed the stones.\n“Am I finished with my work, Ancient One?” Venli asked to\nSubservience. “Is that why you finally brought me here?”\n“Done?” Rine said to Ridicule. “Child, you haven’t even begun. Those\nlittle villages were practice. Today, your true labor begins.”\nI-10. Sheler"

Sheler\n“You have three choices,” the Herdazian general said.\nHe had dark brown skin the color of a weathered stone, and there was a\nhint of grey in the thin mustache on his upper lip. He stepped up to Sheler,\nthen put his hands to his sides. Remarkably, some men affixed manacles to\nthe general’s own wrists. What on Roshar?\n“Pay attention,” the general said. “This is important.”\n“To the manacles?” Sheler said in Herdazian. Life on the border had\nforced him to learn the language. “What is going on here? Do you realize\nthe trouble you’re in for taking me captive?” Sheler started to stand, but one\nof the Herdazian soldiers forced him down so hard, his knees rapped against\nthe hard stone floor of the tent.\n“You have three choices.” The general’s manacles clinked as he twisted\nhis hands in them. “First, you can choose the sword. Now, that might be a\nclean death. A good beheading rarely hurts. Unfortunately, it won’t be a\nheadsman who gets the chance with you. We’ll give the sword to the\nwomen you abused. Each gets a hack, one after another. How long it goes\non will depend on them.”\n“This is outrageous!” Sheler said. “I’m a lighteyes of the fifth dahn! I’m\ncousin to the highlord himself, and—”\n“Second option,” the general said, “is the hammer. We break your legs\nand arms, then hang you from the cliff by the ocean. You might last until the\nstorm that way, but it will be miserable.”\nSheler struggled to no avail. Captured by Herdazians. Their general\nwasn’t even a lighteyes!\nThe general twisted his hands, then pulled them apart. The manacles\nclinked to the ground. Nearby, several of his officers grinned, while others\ngroaned. A scribe had tapped off the time, and gave an accounting of the\nseconds the escape had taken.\nThe general accepted the applause of several men, then thumped another\n—a loser in the betting—on his back. Sheler almost seemed forgotten for a\nmoment. Finally, the general turned back to him. “I wouldn’t take the\nhammer, if I were you. But there’s a third option: the hog.”\n“I demand the right of ransom!” Sheler said. “You must contact my\nhighprince and accept payment based on my rank!”\n“Ransom is for men caught in battle,” the general said. “Not bastards\ncaught robbing and murdering civilians.”\n“My homeland is under invasion!” Sheler shouted. “I was gathering\nresources so we might mount a resistance!”\n“A resistance is not what we caught you mounting.” The general kicked\nat the manacles by his feet. “Choose one of the three options. I don’t have\nall day.”\nSheler licked his lips. How had he ended up in this situation? His\nhomeland gone crazy, the parshmen rampaging, his men scattered by flying\nmonsters? Now this? The dirty Herdazians obviously weren’t going to listen\nto reason. They …\nWait."

They …\nWait.\n“Did you say hog?” Sheler asked.\n“It lives down by the shore,” the Herdazian general said. “That’s your\nthird option. We grease you, and you wrestle the hog. It’s fun for the men to\nwatch. They need sport now and then.”\n“And if I do this, you won’t kill me?”\n“No, but this isn’t as easy as you think. I’ve tried it myself, so I can\nspeak with authority.”\nCrazy Herdazians. “I choose the hog.”\n“As you wish.” The general picked up the manacles and handed them to\nhis officer.\n“Thought you’d fail these ones for sure,” the officer said. “The merchant\nclaimed they’re from the best Thaylen locksmiths.”\n“Doesn’t matter how good the lock is, Jerono,” the general said with a\ngrin, “if the cuffs are loose.” What a ridiculous little man—too-wide smile,\na flat nose, a missing tooth. Why, Highlord Amaram would have—\nSheler was jerked to his feet by the chains, then pulled through the camp\nof Herdazian soldiers on the Alethi border. There were more refugees here\nthan actual fighting men! Give Sheler a single company, and he could rout\nthis entire force.\nHis insufferable captors led him down an incline, past the cliffs and\ntoward the shore. Soldiers and refugees alike gathered above, jeering and\ncalling. Obviously, the Herdazian general was too frightened to actually kill\nan Alethi officer. So they would humiliate him by making him wrestle a pig.\nThey’d have a good laugh, then send him away smarting.\nIdiots. He’d come back with an army.\nOne man locked Sheler’s chain to a metal loop on the stones. Another\napproached with a pitcher of oil. They poured it over Sheler’s head; he\nsputtered as the liquid ran down his face. “What is that stench?”\nAbove, someone blew a horn.\n“I’d say ‘good luck,’ boss,” the Herdazian soldier told Sheler as his\ncompanion ran off, “but I’ve got three marks on you not lasting a full\nminute. Still, who knows. When the general was chained down here, he got\nout in less.”\nThe ocean started to churn.\n“Of course,” the soldier said, “the general likes this kind of thing. He’s a\nlittle weird.”\nThe soldier dashed back up the bank, leaving Sheler locked in place,\ndoused in pungent oil, and gaping as an enormous claw broke the surface of\nthe ocean.\nPerhaps “the hog” was more of a nickname.\nI-11. Her Reward\nVenli’s little spren—whom she’d named Timbre—peeked around the room,\nlooking in each corner and shadowed place, like she did each time Venli let\nher out of the pouch.\nDays had passed since Venli had first arrived at Kholinar.

She wasn’t allowed into Kholinar herself. They kept her\nsequestered in this stormshelter outside, which they called the hermitage.\nVenli hummed to Spite as she leaned against the window, annoyed by the\nincarceration. Even the window had only been installed—cut by a\nShardblade and set with thick stormshutters—after her repeated requests.\nThe city outside called to her. Majestic walls, beautiful buildings. It\nreminded her of Narak … which, actually, her people hadn’t built. In living\nthere, the listeners had profited from the labors of ancient humans, as\nmodern humans had profited from the enslaved singers.\nTimbre floated over to her, then hovered by the window, as if to sneak\nout and look around outside.\n“No,” Venli said.\nTimbre pulsed to Resolve, then inched forward in the air.\n“Stay inside,” Venli said to Command. “They’re watching for spren like\nyou. Descriptions of your kind, and others, have been spread all through the\ncity.”\nThe little spren backed away, pulsing to Annoyance, before settling in\nthe air beside Venli.\nVenli rested her head on her arms. “I feel like a relic,” she whispered.\n“Already I seem like a cast-off ruin from a nearly forgotten day. Are you the\nreason I feel like that, suddenly? I only get this way when I let you out.”\nTimbre pulsed to Peace. Upon hearing that, something stirred deep\nwithin Venli: the Voidspren that occupied her gemheart. That spren couldn’t\nthink, not like Ulim or the higher Voidspren. It was a thing of emotions and\nanimal instincts, but the bond with it granted Venli her form of power.\nShe started to wonder. So many of the Fused were obviously unhinged;\nperhaps their inordinately long lives had taken a toll on their psyches.\nWouldn’t Odium need new leaders for his people? If she proved herself,\ncould she claim a place among them?\nNew Fused. New … gods?\nEshonai had always worried about Venli’s thirst for power, and had\ncautioned her to control her ambitions. Even Demid, at times, had been\nworried for her. And now … and now they were all dead.\nTimbre pulsed to Peace, then to Pleading, then back to Peace.\n“I can’t,” Venli said to Mourning. “I can’t.”\nPleading. More insistent. The Rhythm of the Lost, of Remembrance, and\nthen Pleading.\n“I’m the wrong one,” Venli said to Annoyance. “I can’t do this, Timbre. I\ncan’t resist him.”\nPleading.\n“I made this happen,” she said to Fury. “Don’t you realize that? I’m the\none who caused all this. Don’t plead to me!”\nThe spren shrank, her light diminishing.

Were they all … all being\nturned into Fused? Shouldn’t Venli be thinking about that, not her\nambitions?\nA form changes the way you think, Venli. Everyone knew that. Eshonai\nhad lectured—incessantly, as had been her way—about not letting the form\ndictate one’s actions. Control the form, don’t let it control you.\nBut then, Eshonai had been exemplary. A general and a hero. Eshonai\nhad done her duty.\nAll Venli had ever wanted was power.\nTimbre suddenly pulsed with a flash of light, and zipped away under the\nbed, terrified.\n“Ah,” Venli said to Mourning, looking past the city at the sudden\ndarkening of the sky. The Everstorm. It came about every nine days, and\nthis was the second since her arrival. “So that’s why they didn’t bring an\nevening batch to listen to me.”\nShe folded her arms, took a deep breath, and hummed to Resolve until\nshe lost track and shifted unconsciously to the Rhythm of Destruction. She\ndidn’t close the window. He didn’t like that. Instead, she closed her eyes\nand listened to the thunder. Lightning flashed beyond her eyelids, red and\ngarish. The spren in her leaped to feel it, and she grew excited, the Rhythm\nof Destruction swelling inside her.\nHer people might be gone, but this … this power was worth it. How\ncould she not embrace this?\nHow long can you keep being two people, Venli? She seemed to hear\nEshonai’s voice. How long will you vacillate?\nThe storm hit, wind blasting through the window, lifting her … and she\nentered some kind of vision. The building vanished, and she was tossed\nabout in the storm—but she knew that after it passed, she wouldn’t be hurt.\nVenli eventually dropped onto a hard surface. She hummed to\nDestruction and opened her eyes, finding herself standing on a platform\nhanging high in the sky, far above Roshar, which was a blue and brown\nglobe below. Behind her was a deep, black nothingness marred only by a\ntiny blip that could have been a single star.\nThat yellow-white star expanded toward her at an awesome speed,\nswelling, growing, until it overwhelmed her with an incredible flame. She\nfelt her skin melting, her flesh burning away.\nYou are not telling the story well enough, Odium’s voice declared,\nspeaking the ancient tongue. You grow restless. The Fused inform me of it.\nThis will change or you will be destroyed.\n“Y-yes … Lord.” Speaking burned away her tongue. She could no longer\nsee; the fire had claimed her eyes. Pain. Agony. But she couldn’t bend to it,\nfor the god before her demanded all of her attention. The pain of her body\nbeing consumed was nothing compared to him.\nYou are mine.

Voices\nEIGHT YEARS AGO\nGavilar was starting to look worn.\nDalinar stood at the back of the king’s den, listening with half an ear.\nThe king spoke with the heirs of the highprinces, staying to safe topics, like\nGavilar’s plans for various civic projects in Kholinar.\nHe’s looking so old, Dalinar thought. Grey before his time. He needs\nsomething to revitalize him. A hunt, maybe?\nDalinar didn’t need to participate in the meeting; his job was to loom.\nOccasionally, one of the younger men would glance toward the perimeter of\nthe room, and see the Blackthorn there in shadow. Watching.\nHe saw fires reflected in their eyes, and heard the weeping of children in\nthe back of his mind.\nDon’t be weak, Dalinar thought. It’s been almost three years.\nThree years, living with what he’d done. Three years, wasting away in\nKholinar. He’d assumed it would get better.\nIt was only getting worse.\nSadeas had carefully spun news of the Rift’s destruction to the king’s\nadvantage. He’d called it regrettable that the Rifters had forced Kholin\naction by killing Dalinar’s wife, and named it unfortunate that the city had\ncaught fire during the fighting. Gavilar had publicly censured Dalinar and\nSadeas for “losing the city to flames,” but his denunciation of the Rifters\nhad been far more biting.\nThe implication was clear. Gavilar didn’t want to unleash the\nBlackthorn. Even he couldn’t predict what kind of destruction Dalinar\nwould bring. Obviously, such measures were a last resort—and these days,\neveryone was careful to give him plenty of other options.\nSo efficient. All it had cost was one city. And possibly Dalinar’s sanity.\nGavilar suggested to the gathered lighteyes that they light a fire in the\nhearth, for warmth. Well, that was the signal that he could leave. Dalinar\ncould not stand fire. The scent of smoke smelled like burning skin, and the\ncrackling of flames reminded him only of her.\nDalinar slipped out the back door, stepping into a hallway on the third\nfloor, heading toward his own rooms.

He had moved himself and his sons\ninto the royal palace. His own keep reminded him too much of her.\nStorms. Standing in that room—looking at the fear in the eyes of\nGavilar’s guests—had made the pain and memories particularly acute today.\nHe was better on some days. Others … felt like today. He needed a stiff\ndrink from his wine cabinet.\nUnfortunately, as he rounded through the curved corridor, he smelled\nincense in the air. Coming from his rooms? Renarin was burning it again.\nDalinar pulled up, as if he’d run up against something solid, then turned\non his heel and walked away. It was too late, unfortunately. That scent …\nthat was her scent.\nHe strode down to the second floor, passing bloodred carpets, pillared\nhallways. Where to get something to drink? He couldn’t go out into the city,\nwhere people acted so terrified of him. The kitchens? No, he wouldn’t go\nbegging to one of the palace chefs—who would in turn tiptoe to the king\nand whisper that the Blackthorn had been at the violets again. Gavilar\ncomplained at how much Dalinar drank, but what else did soldiers do when\nnot at war? Didn’t he deserve a little relaxation, after all he’d done for this\nkingdom?\nHe turned toward the king’s throne room, which—as the king was using\nhis den instead—would be empty today. He went in through the servants’\nentrance and stepped into a small staging room, where food was prepared\nbefore being delivered to the king. Using a sapphire sphere for light,\nDalinar knelt and rummaged in one of the cupboards. Usually they kept\nsome rare vintages here for impressing visitors.\nThe cupboards were empty. Damnation. He found nothing but pans,\ntrays, and cups. A few bags of Herdazian spices. He fumed, tapping the\ncounter. Had Gavilar discovered that Dalinar was coming here, and moved\nthe wine? The king thought him a drunkard, but Dalinar indulged only on\noccasion. On bad days. Drink quieted the sounds of people crying in the\nback of his mind.\nWeeping. Children burning. Begging their fathers to save them from the\nflames. And Evi’s voice, accompanying them all …\nWhen was he going to escape this? He was becoming a coward!\nNightmares when he tried to sleep. Weeping in his mind whenever he saw\nfire. Storms take Evi for doing this to him! If she’d acted like an adult\ninstead of a child—if she’d been able to face duty or just reality for once—\nshe wouldn’t have gotten herself killed.\nHe stomped into the corridor and strode right into a group of young\nsoldiers. They scrambled to the sides of the hallway and saluted. Dalinar\ntipped his head toward their salutes, trying to keep the thunder from his\nexpression.\nThe consummate general.

At fifteen, the youth was growing tall and handsome.\nHe got the former from Dalinar. Today, Adolin wore a fashionable suit with\nfar too much embroidery, and boots that were topped by silver.\n“That’s not a standard-issue uniform, soldier,” Dalinar said to him.\n“I know!” Adolin said. “I had it specially tailored!”\nStorms … His son was becoming a fop.\n“Father,” Adolin said, stepping up and making an eager fist. “Did you get\nmy message? I’ve got a bout set up with Tenathar. Father, he’s ranked. It’s a\nstep toward winning my Blade!” He beamed at Dalinar.\nEmotions warred inside of Dalinar. Memories of good years spent with\nhis son in Jah Keved, riding or teaching him the sword.\nMemories of her. The woman from whom Adolin had inherited that\nblond hair and that smile. So genuine. Dalinar wouldn’t trade Adolin’s\nsincerity for a hundred soldiers in proper uniforms.\nBut he also couldn’t face it right now.\n“Father?” Adolin said.\n“You’re in uniform, soldier. Your tone is too familiar. Is this how I taught\nyou to act?”\nAdolin blushed, then put on a stronger face. He didn’t wilt beneath the\nstern words. When censured, Adolin only tried harder.\n“Sir!” the young man said. “I’d be proud if you’d watch my bout this\nweek. I think you’ll be pleased with my performance.”\nStorming child. Who could deny him? “I’ll be there, soldier. And will\nwatch with pride.”\nAdolin grinned, saluted, then dashed back to join the others. Dalinar\nwalked off as quickly as he could, to get away from that hair, that wonderful\n—haunting—smile.\nWell, he needed a drink now more than ever. But he would not go\nbegging to the cooks. He had another option, one that he was certain even\nhis brother—sly though Gavilar was—wouldn’t have considered. He went\ndown another set of steps and reached the eastern gallery of the palace, now\npassing ardents with shaved heads. It was a sign of his desperation that he\ncame all the way out here, facing their condemning eyes.\nHe slipped down the stairwell into the depths of the building, entering\nhalls that led toward the kitchens in one direction, the catacombs in the\nother. A few twists and turns led him out onto the Beggars’ Porch: a small\npatio between the compost heaps and the gardens. Here, a group of\nmiserable people waited for the offerings Gavilar gave after dinner.\nSome begged of Dalinar, but a glare made the rag-clothed wretches pull\nback and cower. At the back of the porch, he found Ahu huddled in the\nshadows between two large religious statues, their backs facing the beggars,\ntheir hands spread toward the gardens.\nAhu was an odd one, even for a crazy beggar.

His clothing was mere\nscraps, and he smelled worse than the compost.\nSomehow he always had a bottle with him.\nAhu giggled at Dalinar. “Have you seen me?”\n“Unfortunately.” Dalinar settled on the ground. “I have smelled you too.\nWhat are you drinking today? It had better not be water this time, Ahu.”\nAhu wagged a stout, dark bottle. “Dunno what it is, little child. Tastes\ngood.”\nDalinar tried a sip and hissed. A burning wine, no sweetness to it at all. A\nwhite, though he didn’t recognize the vintage. Storms … it smelled\nintoxicating.\nDalinar took a chug, then handed the bottle back to Ahu. “How are the\nvoices?”\n“Soft, today. They chant about ripping me apart. Eating my flesh.\nDrinking my blood.”\n“Pleasant.”\n“Hee hee.” Ahu snuggled back against the branches of the hedge-wall, as\nif they were soft silk. “Nice. Not bad at all, little child. What of your\nnoises?”\nIn reply, Dalinar reached out his hand. Ahu gave him the bottle. Dalinar\ndrank, welcoming the fuzzing of mind that would quiet the weeping.\n“Aven begah,” Ahu said. “It’s a fine night for my torment, and no telling\nthe skies to be still. Where is my soul, and who is this in my face?”\n“You’re a strange little man, Ahu.”\nAhu cackled his response and waved for the wine. After a drink, he\nreturned it to Dalinar, who wiped off the beggar’s spittle with his shirt.\nStorm Gavilar for pushing him to this.\n“I like you,” Ahu said to Dalinar. “I like the pain in your eyes. Friendly\npain. Companionable pain.”\n“Thanks.”\n“Which one got to you, little child?” Ahu asked. “The Black Fisher? The\nSpawning Mother, the Faceless? Moelach is close. I can hear his wheezing,\nhis scratching, his scraping at time like a rat breaking through walls.”\n“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”\n“Madness,” Ahu said, then giggled. “I used to think it wasn’t my fault.\nBut you know, we can’t escape what we did? We let them in. We attracted\nthem, befriended them, took them out to dance and courted them. It is our\nfault. You open yourself to it, and you pay the price. They ripped my brain\nout and made it dance! I watched.”\nDalinar paused, the bottle halfway to his lips. Then he held it out to Ahu.\n“Drink this. You need it.”\nAhu obliged.\nSometime later, Dalinar stumbled back to his rooms, feeling downright\nserene—thoroughly smashed and without a crying child to be heard. At the\ndoor, he stopped and looked back down the corridor.

Um …\nA voice drifted through the closed door. Was that Adolin inside? Dalinar\nstarted, then focused. Storms, he’d come to the wrong door.\nAnother voice. Was that Gavilar? Dalinar leaned in.\n“I’m worried about him, Uncle,” Adolin’s voice said.\n“Your father never adjusted to being alone, Adolin,” the king replied.\n“He misses your mother.”\nIdiots, Dalinar thought. He didn’t miss Evi. He wanted to be rid of her.\nThough … he did ache now that she was gone. Was that why she wept\nfor him so often?\n“He’s down with the beggars again,” another voice said from inside.\nElhokar? That little boy? Why did he sound like a man? He was only …\nhow old? “He tried the serving room again first. Seems he forgot he drank\nthat all last time. Honestly, if there’s a bottle hidden in this palace\nanywhere, that drunken fool will find it.”\n“My father is not a fool!” Adolin said. “He’s a great man, and you owe\nhim your—”\n“Peace, Adolin,” Gavilar said. “Both of you, hold your tongues. Dalinar\nis a soldier. He’ll fight through this. Perhaps if we go on a trip we can\ndistract him from his loss. Maybe Azir?”\nTheir voices … He had just rid himself of Evi’s weeping, but hearing\nthis dragged her back. Dalinar gritted his teeth and stumbled to the proper\ndoor. Inside, he found the nearest couch and collapsed.\n89. Damnation\nMy research into the Unmade has convinced me that these things were\nnot simply “spirits of the void” or “nine shadows who moved in the\nnight.” They were each a specific kind of spren, endowed with vast\npowers.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 3\nAdolin had never bothered imagining what Damnation might look like.\nTheology was for women and scribes. Adolin figured he’d try to follow\nhis Calling, becoming the best swordsman he could. The ardents told him\nthat was enough, that he didn’t need to worry about things like Damnation.\nYet here he was, kneeling on a white marble platform with a black sky\noverhead, a cold sun—if it could even be called that—hanging at the end of\na roadway of clouds. An ocean of shifting glass beads, clattering against one\nanother. Tens of thousands of flames, like the tips of oil lamps, hovering\nabove that ocean.\nAnd the spren. Terrible, awful spren swarmed in the ocean of beads,\nbearing a multitude of nightmare forms. They twisted and writhed, howling\nwith inhuman voices. He didn’t recognize any of the varieties.\n“I’m dead,” Adolin whispered. “We’re dead, and this is Damnation.”\nBut what of the pretty, blue-white spren girl? The creature with the stiff\nrobe and a mesmerizing, impossible symbol instead of a head? What of the\nwoman with the scratched-out eyes?

Kaladin Stormblessed, pulling in power,\nfloated into the air. Beads rattled, and every monster in the writhing throng\nturned—as if one—to fixate upon Kaladin.\n“Kaladin!” the spren girl shouted. “Kaladin, they feed on Stormlight!\nYou’ll draw their attention. Everything’s attention.”\n“Drehy and Skar…” Kaladin said. “Our soldiers. Where are they?”\n“They’re still on the other side,” Shallan said, standing up beside Adolin.\nThe creature with the twisted head took her arm, steadying her. “Storms,\nthey might be safer than we are. We’re in Shadesmar.”\nSome of the lights nearby vanished. Candles’ flames being snuffed out.\nMany spren swam toward the platform, joining an increasingly large\ngroup that churned around it, causing a ruckus in the beads. The majority of\nthem were long eel-like things, with ridges along their backs and purple\nantennae that squirmed like tongues and seemed to be made of thick liquid.\nBeneath them, deep in the beads, something enormous shifted, causing\nbeads to roll off one another in piles.\n“Kaladin!” the blue girl shouted. “Please!”\nHe looked at her, and seemed to see her for the first time. The Light\nvanished from him, and he dropped—hard—to the platform.\nAzure held her thin Shardblade, gaze fixed on the things swimming\nthrough the beads around their platform. The only one who didn’t seem\nfrightened was the strange spren woman with the scratched-out eyes and the\nskin made of rough cloth. Her eyes … they weren’t empty sockets. Instead\nshe was like a portrait where the eyes had been scraped off.\nAdolin shivered. “So…” he said. “Any idea what is happening?”\n“We’re not dead,” Azure growled. “They call this place Shadesmar. It’s\nthe realm of thought.”\n“I peek into this place when I Soulcast,” Shallan said. “Shadesmar\noverlaps the real world, but many things are inverted here.”\n“I passed through it when I first came to your land about a year ago,”\nAzure added. “I had guides then, and I tried to avoid looking at too much\ncrazy stuff.”\n“Smart,” Adolin said. He put his hand to the side to summon his own\nShardblade.\nThe woman with the scratched eyes stretched her head toward him in an\nunnatural way, then screeched with a loud, piercing howl.\nAdolin stumbled away, nearly colliding with Shallan and her … her\nspren? Was that Pattern?\n“That is your sword,” Pattern said in a perky voice. He had no mouth\nthat Adolin could see. “Hmmm. She is quite dead. I don’t think you can\nsummon her here.” He cocked his bizarre head, looking at Azure’s Blade.\n“Yours is different. Very curious.”\nThe thing deep beneath their platform shifted again.\n“That is probably bad,” Pattern noted. “Hmmm … yes. Those spren\nabove us are the souls of the Oathgate, and that one deep beneath us is\nlikely one of the Unmade. It must be very large on this side.”"

It must be very large on this side.”\n“So what do we do?” Shallan asked.\nPattern looked in one direction, then the other. “No boat. Hmmm. Yes,\nthat is a problem, isn’t it?”\nAdolin spun around. Some of the eel-like spren climbed onto the\nplatform, using stumpy legs that Adolin had missed earlier. Those long\npurple antennae stretched toward him, wiggling.…\nFearspren, he realized. Fearspren were little globs of purple goo that\nlooked exactly like the tips of those antennae.\n“We need to get off this platform,” Shallan said. “Everything else is\nsecondary. Kaladin…” She trailed off as she glanced toward him.\nThe bridgeman knelt on the stone, head bowed, shoulders slumped.\nStorms … Adolin had been forced to carry him away from the battle, numb\nand broken. Looked like that emotion had caught up to him again.\nKaladin’s spren—Adolin could only guess that was the identity of the\npretty girl in blue—stood beside him, one hand resting protectively on his\nback. “Kaladin’s not well,” she said.\n“I have to be well,” Kaladin said, his voice hoarse as he climbed back to\nhis feet. His long hair fell across his face, obscuring his eyes. Storms. Even\nsurrounded by monsters, the bridgeman could look intimidating. “How do\nwe get to safety? I can’t fly us without attracting attention.”\n“This place is the inverse of your world,” Azure said. She stepped back\nfrom a long antenna exploring in her direction. “Where there are larger\nbodies of water on Roshar, we will have land here, correct?”\n“Mmm,” Pattern said, nodding.\n“The river?” Adolin asked. He tried to orient himself, looking past the\nthousands of floating lights. “There.” He pointed at a lump he could barely\nspot in the distance. Like a long island.\nKaladin stared at it, frowning. “Can we swim in these beads?”\n“No,” Adolin said, remembering what it had felt like to fall into this\nocean. “I…”\nThe beads rattled and clacked against one another as the large thing\nsurged beneath. In the near distance, a single spire of rock broke the\nsurface, tall and black. It emerged like a mountain peak slowly lifting from\nthe sea, beads rattling in waves around it. As it grew to the height of a\nbuilding, a joint appeared. Storms. It wasn’t a spire or a mountain … it was\na claw.\nMore emerged in other directions. An enormous hand was reaching\nslowly upward through the glass beads. Deep beneath them a heartbeat\nbegan sounding, rattling the beads.\nAdolin stumbled back, horrified, and nearly slipped into the bead ocean.\nHe kept his balance, barely, and found himself face-to-face with the woman\nwith scratches for eyes. She stared at him, completely emotionless, as if\nwaiting for him to try to summon his Shardblade so she could scream again.\nDamnation.

She knelt on the white stone of the\nplatform, searching among the beads. Each gave her an impression of an\nobject in the Physical Realm. A dropped shield. A vase from the palace. A\nscarf.\nNearby, hundreds of little spren—like little orange or green people, only\na few inches tall—were climbing among the spheres. She ignored those,\nsearching for the soul of something that would help.\n“Shallan,” Pattern said, kneeling. “I don’t think … I don’t think\nSoulcasting will accomplish anything? It will change an object in the other\nrealm, but not here.”\n“What can I do here?” Those spines or claws or whatever rose around\nthem, inevitable, deadly.\nPattern hummed, hands clasped before him. His fingers were too smooth,\nas if they were chiseled of obsidian. His head shifted and changed, going\nthrough its sequence—the spherical mass was never the same, yet somehow\nstill always felt like him.\n“My memory…” he said. “I don’t remember.”\nStormlight, Shallan thought. Jasnah had told her to never enter\nShadesmar without Stormlight. Shallan pulled a sphere from her pocket—\nshe still wore Veil’s outfit. The beads nearby reacted, trembling and rolling\ntoward her.\n“Mmmm…” Pattern said. “Dangerous.”\n“I doubt staying here will be better,” Shallan said. She sucked in a little\nStormlight, only one mark’s worth. As before, the spren didn’t seem to\nnotice her use of Stormlight as much as they had Kaladin’s. She rested her\nfreehand against the surface of the ocean. Beads stopped rolling and instead\nclicked together beneath her hand. When she pushed down, they resisted.\nGood first step, she thought, drawing in more Stormlight. The beads\npressed around her hand, gathering, rolling onto one another. She cursed,\nworried that she’d soon just have a big pile of beads.\n“Shallan,” Pattern said, poking at one of the beads. “Perhaps this?”\nIt was the soul of the shield she’d felt earlier. She moved the sphere to\nher gloved safehand, then pressed her other hand to the ocean. She used that\nbead’s soul as a guide—much like she used a Memory as a guide for doing\na sketch—and the other beads obediently rolled together and locked into\nplace, forming an imitation of the shield.\nPattern stepped out onto it, then jumped up and down happily. Her shield\nheld him without sinking, though he seemed as heavy as an ordinary person.\nGood enough. Now she just needed something big enough to hold them all.\nPreferably, as she considered, two somethings.\n“You, sword lady!” Shallan said, pointing at Azure. “Help me over here.\nAdolin, you too. Kaladin, see if you can brood this place into submission.”\nAzure and Adolin hurried over.\nKaladin turned, frowning. “What?”\nDon’t think about that haunted look in his eyes, Shallan thought. Don’t\nthink about what you’ve done in bringing us here, or how it happened.\nDon’t think, Shallan.\nHer mind went blank, like it did in preparation for drawing, then locked\non to her task."

Yes, there are huge philosophical\nimplications in that. Let’s try to ignore them, shall we? When you touch a\nbead, you should be able to sense what it represents.”\nAzure sheathed her Shardblade and knelt, feeling at the spheres. “I\ncan … Yes, there’s an impression to each one.”\n“We need the soul of something long and flat.” Shallan plunged her\nhands into the spheres, eyes closed, letting the impressions wash over her.\n“I can’t sense anything,” Adolin said. “What am I doing wrong?” He\nsounded overwhelmed, but don’t think about that.\nLook. Fine clothing that hadn’t been taken out of its trunk in a long, long\ntime. So old that it saw the dust as part of itself.\nWithering fruit that understood its purpose: decompose and stick its\nseeds to the rock, where they could hopefully weather storms long enough\nto sprout and gain purchase.\nSwords, recently swung and glorying in their purpose fulfilled. Other\nweapons belonged to dead men, blades that had the faintest inkling that\nthey’d failed somehow.\nLiving souls bobbed around, a swarm of them entering the Oathgate\ncontrol chamber. One brushed Shallan. Drehy the bridgeman. For a brief\nmoment she felt what it was like to be him. Worried for Kaladin. Panicked\nthat nobody was in charge, that he would have to take command. He wasn’t\na commander. You couldn’t be a rebel if you were in charge. He liked being\ntold what to do—that way he could find a method to do it with style.\nDrehy’s worries caused her own to bubble up. The bridgemen’s powers\nwill fade without Kaladin, she thought. What of Vathah, Red, and Ishnah? I\ndidn’t—\nFocus. Something reached out from the back of her mind, grabbed those\nthoughts and feelings, and yanked them into the darkness. Gone.\nShe brushed a bead with her fingers. A large door, like a keep’s gate. She\ngrabbed the sphere and shifted it to her safehand. Unfortunately, the next\nbead she touched was the palace itself. Momentarily stunned by the majesty\nof it, Shallan gaped. She held the entire palace in her hand.\nToo large. She dropped it and kept searching.\nTrash that still saw itself as a child’s toy.\nA goblet that had been made from melted-down nails, taken from an old\nbuilding.\nThere. She seized hold of a sphere and pressed Stormlight into it. A\nbuilding rose before her, made entirely out of beads: a copy of the Oathgate\ncontrol building. She managed to make its top rise only a few feet above the\nsurface, most of the building sinking into the depths.

Finally, Kaladin picked\nup his pack and walked with his spren onto the rooftop.\nShallan joined them with the aid of a hand from Adolin. She clutched the\nsphere that was the soul of the building, and tried to make the bead structure\nmove through the sea like a raft.\nIt resisted, sitting there motionless. Well, she had another plan. She\nscurried to the other side of the roof and stretched down, held by Pattern, to\ntouch the sea again. She used the soul of the large door to make another\nstanding platform. Pattern jumped down, followed by Adolin and Azure.\nOnce they’d all piled precariously on the door, Shallan let go of the\nbuilding. It crashed down behind them, beads falling in a tumult,\nfrightening some of the little green spren crawling among the beads nearby.\nShallan reconstructed the building on the other side of the door, with\nonly the rooftop showing. They filed across.\nThey progressed like that—following building with door and door with\nbuilding—inching toward that distant land. Each iteration took Stormlight,\nthough she could reclaim some from each creation before it collapsed.\nSome of the eel-like spren with the long antennae followed them, curious,\nbut the rest of the varieties—and there were dozens—let them pass without\nmuch notice.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “Much emotion on the other side. Yes, this is\ngood. It distracts them.”\nThe work was tiring and tedious, but step by step, Shallan moved them\naway from the frothing mess of the city of Kholinar. They passed the\nfrightened lights of souls, the hungry spren who feasted on the emotions\nfrom the other side.\n“Mmm…” Pattern whispered to her. “Look, Shallan. The lights of souls\nare no longer disappearing. People must be surrendering in Kholinar. I\nknow you do not like the destruction of your own.”\nThat was good, but not unexpected. The parshmen had never massacred\ncivilians, though she couldn’t say for certain what happened to Azure’s\nsoldiers. She hoped fervently they were able to either escape or surrender.\nShallan had to edge her group frighteningly close to two of the spines\nthat had emerged from the depths. Those gave no sign of having noticed\nthem. Beyond, they reached a calmer space out among the beads. A place\nwhere the only sound came from the clacking of glass.\n“She corrupted them,” Kaladin’s spren whispered.\nShallan took a break, wiping her brow with a handkerchief from her\nsatchel. They were distant enough that the lights of souls in Kholinar were\njust a general haze of light.\n“What was that, spren?” Azure asked. “Corrupted?”\n“That’s why we’re here. The Oathgate—do you remember those two\nspren in the sky? Those two are the gateway’s soul, but the red coloring …\nThey must be His now. That’s why we ended up here, instead of going to\nUrithiru.”\nSja-anat, Shallan thought, said she was supposed to kill us. But that\nshe’d try not to."

People\nnaturally seemed to like him. Even in his darkest moment—standing on the\nbattlefield and watching Sadeas’s armies retreat, abandoning him and his\nfather—he’d understood what was happening to him.\nNot today. Today he was just a confused little boy standing in\nDamnation.\nToday, Adolin Kholin was nothing.\nHe stepped onto another copy of the door. They had to huddle together\nwhile Shallan dismissed the rooftop behind, sending it crashing down, then\nsqueezed past everyone to raise another copy of the building.\nAdolin felt small. So very small. He started toward the rooftop. Kaladin,\nhowever, remained standing on the door, staring sightlessly. Syl, his spren,\ntugged his hand.\n“Kaladin?” Adolin asked.\nKaladin finally shook himself and gave in to Syl’s prodding. He walked\nonto the rooftop. Adolin followed, then took Kaladin’s pack—deliberately\nbut firmly—and swung it over his own shoulder. Kaladin let him. Behind,\nthe doorway shattered back into the ocean of beads.\n“Hey,” Adolin said. “It will be all right.”\n“I survived Bridge Four,” Kaladin growled. “I’m strong enough to\nsurvive this.”\n“I’m pretty sure you could survive anything. Storms, bridgeboy, the\nAlmighty used some of the same stuff he put into Shardblades when he\nmade you.”\nKaladin shrugged. But as they walked onto the next platform, his\nexpression grew distant again. He stood while the rest of them moved on.\nAlmost like he was waiting for their bridge to dissolve and dump him into\nthe sea.\n“I couldn’t make them see,” Kaladin whispered. “I couldn’t … couldn’t\nprotect them. I’m supposed to be able to protect people, aren’t I?”\n“Hey,” Adolin said. “You really think that strange spren with the weird\neyes is my sword?”\nKaladin started and focused on him, then scowled. “Yes, Adolin. I\nthought that was clear.”\n“I was just wondering.” Adolin glanced over his shoulder and shivered.\n“What do you think about this place? Have you ever heard of anything like\nit?”\n“Do you have to talk right now, Adolin?”\n“I’m frightened. I talk when I’m frightened.”\nKaladin glared at him as if suspecting what Adolin was doing. “I know\nlittle of this place,” he finally answered. “But I think it’s where spren are\nborn.…”\nAdolin kept him talking. As Shallan created each new platform, Adolin\nwould lightly touch Kaladin on the elbow or shoulder and the bridgeman\nwould step forward. Kaladin’s spren hovered nearby, but she let Adolin\nguide the conversation.\nSlowly they approached the strip of land, which turned out to be made of\na deep, glassy black stone.

It was the strangest thing;\nAdolin watched it dim from Alethi jet-black to a faint grey as she sat down.\nMust be another effect of this strange place.\nHow much did she know of Shadesmar? He’d been so focused on\nKaladin, he hadn’t thought to interrogate her. Unfortunately, he was so tired\nright now, he was having trouble thinking straight.\nAdolin stepped back onto the platform as Pattern stepped off. Shallan\nlooked as if she was about to collapse. She stumbled, and the platform\nruptured. He managed to grab her, and fortunately they only fell to waist-\ndeep in the beads before their feet touched ground. The little balls of glass\nseemed to slide and move too easily, not supporting their weight.\nAdolin had to practically haul Shallan through the tide of beads up onto\nthe bank. There, she toppled backward, groaning and closing her eyes.\n“Shallan?” he asked, kneeling beside her.\n“I’m fine. It just took … concentration. Visualization.”\n“We need to find another way back to our world,” Kaladin said, seated\nnearby. “We can’t rest. They’re fighting. We need to help them.”\nAdolin surveyed his companions. Shallan lay on the ground; her spren\nhad joined her, lying in a similar posture and looking up at the sky. Azure\nslumped forward, her small Shardblade across her lap. Kaladin continued to\nstare at nothing with haunted eyes, his spren hovering behind him, worried.\n“Azure,” Adolin said, “is it safe here, on this land?”\n“As safe as anywhere in Shadesmar,” she said tiredly. “The place can be\ndangerous if you attract the wrong spren, but there isn’t anything we can do\nabout that.”\n“Then we camp here.”\n“But—” Kaladin said.\n“We camp,” Adolin said. Gentle, but firm. “We can barely stand up\nstraight, bridgeman.”\nKaladin didn’t argue further. Adolin scouted up the bank, though each\nstep felt like it was weighted with stone. He found a small depression in the\nglassy stone and—with some urging—got the rest of them to move to it.\nAs they made improvised beds from their coats and packs, Adolin looked\none last time at the city, standing witness to the fall of his birthplace.\nStorms, he thought. Elhokar … Elhokar is dead.\nLittle Gav had been taken, and Dalinar was planning to abdicate. Third\nin line was … Adolin himself.\nKing.\n90. Reborn\nI have done my best to separate fact from fiction, but the two blend like\nmixing paint when the Voidbringers are involved. Each of the Unmade\nhas a dozen names, and the powers ascribed to them range from the\nfanciful to the terrifying.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 4\nSzeth-son-son …\nSzeth-son …\nSzeth, Truthless …\nSzeth.

        "text": "Szeth-son-son …\nSzeth-son …\nSzeth, Truthless …\nSzeth. Just Szeth.\nSzeth of Shinovar, once called the Assassin in White, had been reborn.\nMostly.\nThe Skybreakers whispered of it. Nin, Herald of Justice, had restored\nhim following his defeat in the storm. Like most things, death had not been\nSzeth’s to claim. The Herald had used a type of fabrial to heal his body\nbefore his spirit departed.\nIt had almost taken too long, however. His spirit hadn’t properly\nreattached to his body.\nSzeth walked with the others out onto the stone field before their small\nfortress, which overlooked the Purelake. The air was humid, almost like that\nof his homeland, though it didn’t smell earthy or alive. It smelled of\nseaweed and wet stone.\nThere were five other hopefuls, all of them younger than Szeth. He was\nshortest among them, and the only one who kept his head bald. He couldn’t\ngrow a full head of hair, even if he didn’t shave it.\nThe other five kept their distance from him. Perhaps it was because of\nthe way he left a glowing afterimage when he moved: a sign of his soul’s\nimproper reattachment. Not all could see it, but these could. They were\nclose enough to the Surges.\nOr maybe they feared him because of the black sword in a silver sheath\nthat he wore strapped to his back.\nOh, it’s the lake! the sword said in his mind. It had an eager voice that\ndidn’t sound distinctly feminine or masculine. You should draw me, Szeth! I\nwould love to see the lake. Vasher says there are magic fish here. Isn’t that\ninteresting?\n“I have been warned, sword-nimi,” Szeth reminded the weapon, “not to\ndraw you except in the case of extreme emergency. And only if I carry\nmuch Stormlight, lest you feed upon my soul.”\nWell, I wouldn’t do that, the sword said. It made a huffing sound. I don’t\nthink you’re evil at all, and I only destroy things that are evil.\nThe sword was an interesting test, given him by Nin the Herald—called\nNale, Nalan, or Nakku by most stonewalkers. Even after weeks of carrying\nthis black sword, Szeth did not understand what the experience was to teach\nhim.\nThe Skybreakers arranged themselves to watch the hopefuls. There were\nsome fifty here, and that didn’t count the dozens who were supposedly out\non missions. So many. An entire order of Knights Radiant had survived the\nRecreance and had been watching for the Desolation for two thousand\nyears, constantly replenishing their numbers as others died of old age.\nSzeth would join them. He would accept their training, as Nin had\npromised him he would receive, then travel to his homeland of Shinovar.\nThere, he would bring justice to the ones who had falsely exiled him.\nDo I dare bring them judgment? a part of him wondered. Dare I trust\nmyself with the sword of justice?\nThe sword replied. You? Szeth, I think you’re super trustworthy. And I’m\na good judge of people.\n“I was not speaking to you, sword-nimi.”"

And I’m\na good judge of people.\n“I was not speaking to you, sword-nimi.”\nI know. But you were wrong, and so I had to tell you. Hey, the voices\nseem quiet today. That’s nice, isn’t it?\nMentioning it brought the whispers to Szeth’s attention. Nin had not\nhealed Szeth’s madness. He’d called it an effect of Szeth’s connection to the\npowers, and said that he was hearing trembles from the Spiritual Realm.\nMemories of the dead he’d killed.\nHe no longer feared them. He had died and been forced to return. He had\nfailed to join the voices, and now they … they had no power over him,\nright?\nWhy, then, did he still weep in the night, terrified?\nOne of the Skybreakers stepped forward. Ki was a golden-haired\nwoman, tall and imposing. Skybreakers clothed themselves in the garb of\nlocal lawkeepers—so here, in Marabethia, they wore a patterned shoulder\ncloak and a colorful skirtlike wrap. Ki wore no shirt, merely a simple cloth\ntied around her chest.\n“Hopefuls,” she said in Azish, “you have been brought here because a\nfull Skybreaker has vouched for your dedication and solemnity.”\nShe’s boring, the sword said. Where did Nale go?\n“You said he was boring too, sword-nimi,” Szeth whispered.\nThat’s true, but interesting things happen around him. We need to tell\nhim that you should draw me more often.\n“Your first training has already been completed,” Ki said. “You traveled\nwith the Skybreakers and joined them in one of their missions. You have\nbeen evaluated and deemed worthy of the First Ideal. Speak it. You know\nthe Words.”\nVasher always drew me, the sword said, sounding resentful.\n“Life before death,” Szeth said, closing his eyes. “Strength before\nweakness. Journey before destination.”\nThe other five belted it out. Szeth whispered it to the voices that called to\nhim from the darkness. Let them see. He would bring justice to those who\nhad caused this.\nHe’d hoped that the first oath would restore his ability to draw upon\nStormlight—something he had lost along with his previous weapon.\nHowever, when he removed a sphere from his pocket, he was unable to\naccess the Light.\n“In speaking this ideal,” Ki said, “you are officially pardoned for any\npast misdeeds or sins. We have paperwork signed by proper authorities for\nthis region.\n“To progress further among our ranks, and to learn the Lashings, you\nwill need a master to take you as their squire. Then may you speak the\nSecond Ideal. From there, you will need to impress a highspren and form a\nbond—becoming a full Skybreaker. Today you will take the first of many\ntests. Though we will evaluate you, remember that the final measure of your\nsuccess or failure belongs to the highspren. Do you have any questions?”\nNone of the other hopefuls said anything, so Szeth cleared his throat.\n“There are five Ideals,” he said. “Nin told me of this. You have spoken them\nall?”"

You have spoken them\nall?”\n“It’s been centuries since anyone mastered the Fifth Ideal,” Ki said. “One\nbecomes a full Skybreaker by speaking the Third Ideal, the Ideal of\nDedication.”\n“We can … know what the Ideals are?” Szeth asked. For some reason,\nhe’d thought they would be hidden from him.\n“Of course,” Ki said. “You will find no games here, Szeth-son-Neturo.\nThe First Ideal is the Ideal of Radiance. You have spoken it. The second is\nthe Ideal of Justice, an oath to seek and administer justice.\n“The Third Ideal, the Ideal of Dedication, requires you to have first\nbonded a highspren. Once you have, you swear to dedicate yourself to a\ngreater truth—a code to follow. Upon achieving this, you will be taught\nDivision, the second—and more dangerous—of the Surges we practice.”\n“Someday,” another Skybreaker noted, “you may achieve the Fourth\nIdeal: the Ideal of Crusade. In this, you choose a personal quest and\ncomplete it to the satisfaction of your highspren. Once successful, you\nbecome a master like ourselves.”\nCleanse Shinovar, Szeth thought. That would be his quest. “What is the\nFifth Ideal?” he asked.\n“The Ideal of Law,” Ki said. “It is difficult. You must become law,\nbecome truth. As I said, it has been centuries since that was achieved.”\n“Nin told me we were to follow the law—something external, as men are\nchangeable and unreliable. How can we become the law?”\n“Law must come from somewhere,” another of the Skybreaker masters\nsaid. “This is not an oath you will swear, so don’t fixate upon it. The first\nthree will do for most Skybreakers. I was of the Third Ideal for two decades\nbefore achieving the Fourth.”\nWhen nobody else asked further questions, experienced Skybreakers\nbegan Lashing the hopefuls into the air.\n“What is happening?” Szeth asked.\n“We will carry you to the place of the test,” Ki said, “as you cannot\nmove with your own Stormlight until you swear the Second Ideal.”\n“Do I belong with these youths?” Szeth said. “Nin treated me as\nsomething different.” The Herald had taken him on a mission to Tashikk,\nhunting Surgebinders from other orders. A heartless act that Nin had\nexplained would prevent the coming of the Desolation.\nExcept that it had not. The Everstorm’s return had convinced Nin he was\nwrong, and he’d abandoned Szeth in Tashikk. Weeks had passed there until\nNin had returned to collect him. The Herald had dropped Szeth here at the\nfortress, then had vanished into the sky again, this time off to “seek\nguidance.”\n“The Herald,” Ki said, “originally thought that you might skip to the\nThird Ideal because of your past. He is no longer here, however, and we\ncannot judge. You’ll have to follow the same path as everyone else.”\nSzeth nodded. Very well.\n“No further complaints?” Ki asked.\n“It is orderly,” Szeth said, “and you have explained it well. Why would I\ncomplain?”"

For a moment he felt the freedom of flight—reminding him of his\nfirst days, holding an Honorblade long ago. Before he’d become Truthless.\nNo. You were never Truthless. Remember that.\nBesides, this flight was not truly his. He continued falling upward until\nanother Skybreaker caught him and Lashed him downward, counteracting\nthe first effect and leaving him hovering.\nA pair of Skybreakers took him, one under each arm, and the entire\ngroup soared through the air. He couldn’t imagine they’d done this sort of\nthing in the past, as they’d remained hidden for so many years. But they\ndidn’t seem to care about secrecy anymore.\nI like it up here, the sword said. You can see everything.\n“Can you actually see things, sword-nimi?”\nNot like a man. You see all kinds of things, Szeth. Except, unfortunately,\nhow useful I am.\n91. Why He Froze\nI should point out that although many personalities and motives are\nascribed to them, I’m convinced that the Unmade were still spren. As\nsuch, they were as much manifestations of concepts or divine forces as\nthey were individuals.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 7\nKaladin remembered cleaning crem off the bunker floor while in Amaram’s\narmy.\nThat sound of chisel on stone reminded Kal of his mother. He knelt on\nkneepads and scraped at the crem, which had seeped in under doors or had\nbeen tracked in on the boots of soldiers, creating an uneven patina on the\notherwise smooth floor. He wouldn’t have thought that soldiers would care\nthat the ground wasn’t level. Shouldn’t he be sharpening his spear, or … or\noiling something?\nWell, in his experience, soldiers spent little time doing soldier things.\nThey instead spent ages walking places, waiting around, or—in his case—\ngetting yelled at for walking around or waiting in the wrong places. He\nsighed as he worked, using smooth even strokes, like his mother had taught\nhim. Get underneath the crem and push. You could lift it up in flat sections\nan inch or more wide. Much easier than chipping at it from above.\nA shadow darkened the door, and Kal glanced over his shoulder, then\nhunkered down farther. Great.\nSergeant Tukks walked to one of the bunks and settled down, the wood\ngroaning under his weight. Younger than the other sergeants, he had\nfeatures that were … off somehow. Perhaps it was his short stature, or his\nsunken cheeks.\n“You do that well,” Tukks said.\nKal continued to work, saying nothing.\n“Don’t feel so bad, Kal. It’s not unusual for a new recruit to pull back.\nStorms. It’s not so uncommon to freeze in battle, let alone on the practice\nfield.”\n“If it’s so common,” Kal muttered, “why am I being punished?”\n“What, this? A little cleaning duty? Kid, this isn’t punishment. This is to\nhelp you fit in.”\nKal frowned, leaning back and looking up. “Sergeant?”"

Everyone was waiting for you to get a dressing-down. The\nlonger you went without one, the longer you were going to feel like the odd\nman out.”\n“I’m scraping floors because I didn’t deserve to be punished?”\n“That, and for talking back to an officer.”\n“He wasn’t an officer! He was just a lighteyes with—”\n“Better to stop that kind of behavior now. Before you do it to someone\nwho matters. Oh, don’t glower, Kal. You’ll understand eventually.”\nKal attacked a particularly stubborn knob of crem near the leg of a bunk.\n“I found your brother,” Tukks noted.\nKaladin’s breath caught.\n“He’s in the Seventh,” Tukks said.\n“I need to go to him. Can I be transferred? We weren’t supposed to be\nsplit apart.”\n“Maybe I can get him moved here, to train with you.”\n“He’s a messenger! He’s not supposed to train with the spear.”\n“Everyone trains, even the messenger boys,” Tukks said.\nKal gripped his chisel tightly, fighting down the urge to stand up and go\nlooking for Tien. Didn’t they understand? Tien couldn’t hurt cremlings.\nHe’d catch the things and usher them outside, talking to them like pets. The\nimage of him holding a spear was ludicrous.\nTukks took out some fathom bark and started chewing. He leaned back\non the bunk and put his feet up on the footboard. “Make sure you get that\nspot to your left.”\nKaladin sighed, then moved to the indicated place.\n“Do you want to talk about it?” Tukks asked. “The moment when you\nfroze during practice?”\nStupid crem. Why did the Almighty make it?\n“Don’t be ashamed,” Tukks continued. “We practice so you can freeze\nnow, instead of when it will get you killed. You face down a squad,\nknowing they want to kill you even though they’ve never met you. And you\nhesitate, thinking it can’t possibly be true. You can’t possibly be here,\npreparing to fight, to bleed. Everyone feels that fear.”\n“I wasn’t afraid of getting hurt,” Kal said softly.\n“You won’t get far if you can’t admit to a little fear. Emotion is good. It’s\nwhat defines us, makes us—”\n“I wasn’t afraid of getting hurt.” Kaladin took a deep breath. “I was\nafraid of making someone hurt.”\nTukks twisted the bark in his mouth, then nodded. “I see. Well, that’s\nanother problem. Not unusual either, but a different matter indeed.”\nFor a time, the only sound in the large barrack was that of chisel on\nstone. “How do you do it?” Kal finally asked, not looking up. “How can\nyou hurt people, Tukks? They’re just poor darkeyed slobs like us.”\n“I think about my mates,” Tukks said. “I can’t let the lads down. My\nsquad is my family now.”\n“So you kill someone else’s family?”\n“Eventually, we’ll be killing shellheads. But I know what you mean, Kal."

You’d be surprised how many men look in the face of an enemy\nand find that they’re simply not capable of hurting another person.”\nKal closed his eyes, letting the chisel slip from his fingers.\n“It’s good you aren’t so eager,” Tukks said. “Means you’re sane. I’ll take\nten unskilled men with earnest hearts over one callous idiot who thinks this\nis all a game.”\nThe world doesn’t make sense, Kal thought. His father, the consummate\nsurgeon, told him to avoid getting too wrapped up in his patients’ emotions.\nAnd here was a career killer, telling him to care?\nBoots scraped on stone as Tukks stood up. He walked over and rested\none hand on Kal’s shoulder. “Don’t worry about the war, or even the battle.\nFocus on your squadmates, Kal. Keep them alive. Be the man they need.”\nHe grinned. “And get the rest of this floor scraped. I think when you come\nto dinner, you’ll find the rest of the squad more friendly. Just a hunch.”\nThat night, Kaladin discovered that Tukks was right. The rest of the men\ndid seem more welcoming, now that he’d been disciplined. So Kal held his\ntongue, smiled, and enjoyed the companionship.\nHe never told Tukks the truth. When Kal had frozen on the practice field,\nit hadn’t been out of fear. He’d been very sure he could hurt someone. In\nfact, he’d realized that he could kill, if needed.\nAnd that was what had terrified him.\n* * *\nKaladin sat on a chunk of stone that looked like melted obsidian. It grew\nright out of the ground in Shadesmar, this place that didn’t seem real.\nThe distant sun hadn’t shifted in the sky since they’d arrived. Nearby,\none of the strange fearspren crawled along the banks of the sea of glass\nbeads. As big as an axehound, but longer and thinner, it looked vaguely like\nan eel with stumpy legs. The purple feelers on its head wiggled and shifted,\nflowing in his direction. When it didn’t sense anything in him that it wanted,\nit continued along the bank.\nSyl didn’t make any noise as she approached, but he caught sight of her\nshadow coming up from behind—like other shadows here, it pointed toward\nthe sun. She sat down on the lump of glass next to him, then thumped her\nhead sideways, resting it on his arm, her hands in her lap.\n“Others still asleep?” Kaladin asked.\n“Yup. Pattern’s watching over them.” She wrinkled her nose. “Strange.”\n“He’s nice, Syl.”\n“That’s the strange part.”\nShe swung her legs out in front of her, barefoot as usual. It seemed odder\nhere on this side where she was human size. A small flock of spren flew\nabove them, with bulbous bodies, long wings, and flowing tails.

But I do think I heard somewhere that you have to sleep.

Where you come from? I figured you’d … I don’t\nknow … be more mortal here.”\n“I’m still a spren,” she said. “I’m a little piece of God.

Otherwise, we’re practically as mindless as\nthose gloryspren.”\n“But how did you make the transition?”\n“I…” She adopted a distant expression. “You called for me. Or, no, I\nknew that you would someday call for me. So I transferred to the Physical\nRealm, trusting that the honor of men lived, unlike what my father always\nsaid.”\nHer father. The Stormfather.\nIt was so strange to be able to feel her head on his arm. He was\naccustomed to her having very little substance.\n“Could you transfer again?” Kaladin asked. “To carry word to Dalinar\nthat something might be wrong with the Oathgates?”\n“I don’t think so. You’re here, and my bond is to you.” She poked him\nagain. “But this is all a distraction from the real problem.”\n“You’re right. I need a weapon.

Worried. Frightened. “Something’s wrong\ninside you. But I don’t know what.”\nI’ve never locked up in real combat, he thought.

Water Warm as Blood\nThe most important point I wish to make is that the Unmade are still\namong us. I realize this will be contentious, as much of the lore\nsurrounding them is intertwined with theology. However, it is clear to\nme that some of their effects are common in the world—and we simply\ntreat them as we would the manifestations of other spren.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 12\nThe Skybreaker test was to take place in a modest-sized town on the north\nborder of the Purelake. Some people lived in the lake, of course, but sane\nsociety avoided that.\nSzeth landed—well, was landed—near the center of the town square,\nalong with the other hopefuls. The main bulk of the Skybreakers either\nremained in the air or settled onto the cliffs around the town.\nThree masters landed near Szeth, as did a handful of younger men and\nwomen who could Lash themselves. The group being tested today would\ninclude hopefuls like Szeth—who needed to find a master and swear the\nSecond Ideal—and squires who had achieved that step already, but now\nneeded to attract a spren and speak the Third Ideal.\nIt was a varied group; the Skybreakers didn’t seem to care for ethnicity\nor eye color. Szeth was the only Shin among them, but the others included\nMakabaki, Reshi, Vorins, Iriali, and even one Thaylen.\nA tall, strong man in a Marabethian wrap and an Azish coat hefted\nhimself from his seat on a porch. “It took you long enough!” he said in\nAzish, striding toward them. “I sent for you hours ago! The convicts have\nescaped into the lake; who knows how far they’ve gotten by now! They will\nkill again if not stopped. Find and deal with them—you’ll know them by\nthe tattoos on their foreheads.”\nThe masters turned to the squires and hopefuls; some of the more eager\namong them immediately went running toward the water. Several that could\nLash took to the sky.\nSzeth lingered, along with four of the others. He stepped up to Ki, in her\nshoulder cloak of a high judge of Marabethia.\n“How did this man know to send for us?” Szeth asked.\n“We have been expanding our influence, following the advent of the new\nstorm,” she replied. “The local monarchs have accepted us as a unifying\nmartial force, and have given us legal authority. The city’s high minister\nwrote to us via spanreed, pleading for help.”\n“And these convicts?” a squire asked. “What do we know of them, and\nour duty here?”\n“This group of convicts escaped the prison there along the cliffs. The\nreport says they are dangerous murderers. Your task is to find the guilty and\nexecute them. We have writs ordering their deaths.”\n“All of those who escaped are guilty?”\n“They are.”"

We have writs ordering their deaths.”\n“All of those who escaped are guilty?”\n“They are.”\nAt that, several of the other squires left, hurrying to prove themselves.\nStill, Szeth lingered. Something about the situation bothered him. “If these\nmen are murderers, why were they not executed before?”\n“This area is populated by Reshi idealists, Szeth-son-Neturo,” Ki said.\n“They have a strange, nonviolent attitude, even toward criminals. This town\nis charged with holding prisoners from all across the region, and Minister\nKwati is paid tribute to maintain these facilities. Now that the murderers\nhave escaped, mercy is withdrawn. They are to be executed.”\nThat was enough for the last two squires, who took to the sky to begin\ntheir search. And Szeth supposed it was enough for him as well.\nThese are Skybreakers, he thought. They wouldn’t knowingly send us\nafter innocents. He could have taken their implied approval at the start.\nYet … something bothered him. This was a test, but of what? Was it merely\nabout the speed with which they could dispatch the guilty?\nHe started toward the waters.\n“Szeth-son-Neturo,” Ki called to him.\n“Yes?”\n“You walk on stone. Why is this? Each Shin I have known calls stone\nholy, and refuses to set foot on it.”\n“It cannot be holy. If it truly were, Master Ki, it would have burned me\naway long ago.” He nodded to her, then stepped into the Purelake.\nThe water was warmer than he’d remembered. It wasn’t deep at all—\nreportedly, even in the very center of the lake the water wouldn’t reach\nhigher than a man’s thighs, save for the occasional sinkhole.\nYou are far behind those others, the sword said. You’re never going to\ncatch anyone at this rate.\n“I knew a voice like yours once, sword-nimi.”\nThe whispers?\n“No. A single one, in my mind, when I was young.” Szeth shaded his\neyes, looking across the glistening lake. “I hope things go better this time.”\nThe flying squires would catch anyone in the open, so Szeth would need\nto search for less obvious criminals. He only needed one …\nOne? the sword said. You’re not being ambitious enough.\n“Perhaps. Sword-nimi, do you know why you were given to me?”\nBecause you needed help. I’m good at helping.\n“But why me?” Szeth continued trudging through the water. “Nin said I\nwas never to let you leave my presence.”\nIt seemed like more of a burden than an aid. Yes, the sword was a\nShardblade—but one he’d been cautioned about drawing.\nThe Purelake seemed to extend forever, wide as an ocean. Szeth’s steps\nstartled schools of fish, which would follow behind him for a bit,\noccasionally nipping at his boots. Gnarled trees poked from the shallows,\ngorging themselves on the water while their roots grasped the many holes\nand furrows in the lake bed. Rock outcrops broke the lake near the coast,\nbut inward the Purelake grew placid, more empty.\nSzeth turned parallel to the shore.\nYou’re not going the same way as the others.\nThat was true."

You aren’t good at slaying evil. We\nhaven’t killed anyone while you’ve held me.\n“I wonder, sword-nimi. Did Nin-son-God give you to me so I could\npractice resisting your encouragements, or because he saw me as equally\nbloodthirsty? He did call us a good match.”\nI’m not bloodthirsty, the sword said immediately. I just want to be useful.\n“And not bored?”\nWell, that too. The sword made some soft hums, imitating a human deep\nin thought. You say you killed many people before we met. But the\nwhispers … you didn’t take pleasure in destroying those who needed to be\ndestroyed?\n“I am not convinced that they needed to be destroyed.”\nYou killed them.\n“I was sworn to obey.”\nBy a magic rock.\nHe had explained his past to the sword several times now. For some\nreason, it had difficulty understanding—or remembering—certain things.\n“The Oathstone had no magic. I obeyed because of honor, and I sometimes\nobeyed evil or petty men. Now I seek a higher ideal.”\nBut what if you pick the wrong thing to follow? Couldn’t you end up in\nthe same place again? Can’t you just find evil, then destroy it?\n“And what is evil, sword-nimi?”\nI’m sure you can spot it. You seem smart. If increasingly kind of boring.\nWould that he could continue in such monotony.\nNearby, a large twisted tree rose from the bank. Several of the leaves\nalong one branch were pulled in, seeking refuge inside the bark; someone\nhad disturbed them. Szeth didn’t give overt indication that he’d noticed, but\nangled his walk so that he stepped beneath the tree. Part of him hoped the\nman hiding in the tree had the sense to stay hidden.\nHe did not. The man leaped for Szeth, perhaps tempted by the prospect\nof obtaining a fine weapon.\nSzeth sidestepped, but without Lashings he felt slow, awkward. He\nescaped the slashes of the convict’s improvised dagger, but was forced back\ntoward the water.\nFinally! the sword said. All right, here’s what you have to do. Fight him\nand win, Szeth.\nThe criminal rushed him. Szeth caught the hand with the dagger, twisting\nto use the man’s own momentum to send him stumbling into the lake.\nRecovering, the man turned toward Szeth, who was trying to read what\nhe could from the man’s ragged, sorry appearance. Matted, shaggy hair.\nReshi skin bearing many lesions. The poor fellow was so filthy, beggars and\nstreet urchins would find him distasteful company.\nThe convict passed his knife from one hand to the other, wary. Then he\nrushed Szeth again.\nSzeth caught the man by the wrist once more and spun him around, the\nwater splashing. Predictably, the man dropped his knife, which Szeth\nplucked from the water. He dodged the man’s grapple, and in a moment had\none arm around the convict’s neck. Szeth raised the knife and—before he"

Szeth raised the knife and—before he\nformed conscious thought—pressed the blade against the man’s chest,\ndrawing blood.\nHe managed to pull back, preventing himself from killing the convict.\nFool! He needed to question the man. Had his time as Truthless made him\nsuch an eager killer? Szeth lowered the knife, but that gave the man an\nopening to twist and pull them both down into the Purelake.\nSzeth splashed into water warm as blood. The criminal landed on top and\nforced Szeth under the surface, slamming his hand against the stony bottom\nand making him drop the knife. The world became a distorted blur.\nThis isn’t winning, the sword said.\nHow ironic it would be to survive the murder of kings and Shardbearers\nonly to die at the hands of a man with a crude knife. Szeth almost let it\nhappen, but he knew fate was not finished with him yet.\nHe threw off the criminal, who was weak and scrawny. The man tried to\ngrab the knife—which was clearly visible beneath the surface—while Szeth\nrolled the other direction to gain some distance. Unfortunately, the sword on\nhis back got caught between the stones of the lake bottom, and that caused\nhim to jerk back to the water. Szeth growled and—with a heave—ripped\nhimself free, breaking the sword’s harness strap.\nThe weapon sank into the water. Szeth splashed to his feet, turning to\nface the winded, dirty convict.\nThe man glanced at the submerged, silver sword. His eyes glazed, then\nhe grinned wickedly, dropped his knife, and dove for the sword.\nCurious. Szeth stepped back as the convict came up looking gleeful,\nholding the weapon.\nSzeth punched him across the face, his arm leaving a faint afterimage.\nHe grabbed the sheathed sword, ripping it from the weaker man’s hands.\nThough the weapon often seemed too heavy for its size, it now felt light in\nhis fingers. He stepped to the side and swung it—sheath and all—at his\nenemy.\nThe weapon struck the convict’s back with a sickening crunch. The poor\nman splashed down into the lake and fell still.\nI suppose that will do, the sword said. Really, you should have just used\nme in the first place.\nSzeth shook himself. Had he killed the fellow after all? Szeth knelt and\npulled him up by his matted hair. The convict gasped, but his body didn’t\nmove. Not dead, but paralyzed.\n“Did someone work with you in your escape?” Szeth asked. “One of the\nlocal nobility, perhaps?”\n“What?” the man sputtered. “Oh, Vun Makak. What have you done to\nme? I can’t feel my arms, my legs…”\n“Did anyone from the outside help you?”\n“No. Why … why would you ask?” The man sputtered. “Wait. Yes. Who\ndo you want me to name? I’ll do whatever you say. Please.”\nSzeth considered. Not working with the guards then, or the minister of\nthe town. “How did you get out?”\n“Oh, Nu Ralik…” the man said, crying. “We shouldn’t have killed the"

I just wanted … wanted to see the sun again.…”\nSzeth dropped the man back into the water. He stepped onto the shore\nand sat down on a rock, breathing deeply. Not long ago, he had danced with\na Windrunner at the front of a storm. Today, he fought in shallow water\nagainst a half-starved man.\nOh, how he missed the sky.\nThat was cruel, the sword said. Leaving him to drown.\n“Better than feeding him to a greatshell,” Szeth said. “That happens to\ncriminals in this kingdom.”\nBoth are cruel, the sword said.\n“You know of cruelty, sword-nimi?”\nVivenna used to tell me that cruelty is only for men, as is mercy. Only we\ncan choose one or the other, and beasts cannot.\n“You count yourself as a man?”\nNo. But sometimes she talked like she did. And after Shashara made me,\nshe argued with Vasher, saying I could be a poet or a scholar. Like a man,\nright?\nShashara? That sounded like Shalash, the Eastern name for the Herald\nShush-daughter-God. So perhaps this sword’s origin was with the Heralds.\nSzeth rose and walked up the coast, back toward the town.\nAren’t you going to search for other criminals?\n“I needed only one, sword-nimi, to test what has been told to me and to\nlearn a few important facts.”\nLike how smelly convicts are?\n“That is indeed part of the secret.”\nHe passed the small town where the master Skybreakers waited, then\nhiked up the hillside to the prison. The dark block of a structure overlooked\nthe Purelake, but the beautiful vantage was wasted; the place had barely any\nwindows.\nInside, the smell was so foul, he had to breathe through his mouth. The\nbody of a single guard had been left in a pool of blood between cells. Szeth\nalmost tripped over it—there was no light in the place, save for a few\nsphere lamps in the guard post.\nI see, he thought, kneeling beside the fallen man. Yes. This test was\nindeed a curious one.\nOutside, he noted some of the squires returning to the town with corpses\nin tow, though none of the other hopefuls seemed to have found anyone.\nSzeth picked his way carefully down the rocky slope to the town, careful\nnot to drag the sword. Whatever Nin’s reasons for entrusting him with the\nweapon, it was a holy object.\nAt the town, he approached the beefy nobleman, who was trying to make\nsmall talk with Master Ki—failing spectacularly. Nearby, other members of\nthe town were debating the ethics of simply executing murderers, or holding\nthem and risking this. Szeth inspected the dead convicts, and found them as\ndirty as the one he had fought, though two weren’t nearly as emaciated.\nThere was a prison economy, Szeth thought. Food went to those in\npower while others were starved.\n“You,” Szeth said to the nobleman. “I found only one body above. Did\nyou really have a single guard posted to watch all these prisoners?”"

Did\nyou really have a single guard posted to watch all these prisoners?”\nThe nobleman sneered at him. “A Shin stonewalker? Who are you to\nquestion me? Go back to your stupid grass and dead trees, little man.”\n“The prisoners were free to create their own hierarchy,” Szeth continued.\n“And nobody watched to see they didn’t make weapons, as I faced one with\na knife. These men were mistreated, locked in darkness, not given enough\nfood.”\n“They were criminals. Murderers.”\n“And what happened to the money you were sent to administrate this\nfacility? It certainly didn’t go toward proper security.”\n“I don’t have to listen to this!”\nSzeth turned from him to Ki. “Do you have a writ of execution for this\nman?”\n“It is the first we obtained.”\n“What?” the nobleman said. Fearspren boiled up around him.\nSzeth undid the clasp on the sword and drew it.\nA rushing sound, like a thousand screams.\nA wave of power, like the beating of a terrible, stunning wind.\nColors changed around him. They deepened, growing darker and more\nvibrant. The city nobleman’s cloak became a stunning array of deep oranges\nand blood reds.\nThe hair on Szeth’s arms stood on end and his skin spiked with a sudden\nincredible pain.\nDESTROY!\nLiquid darkness flowed from the Blade, then melted to smoke as it fell.\nSzeth screamed at the pain in his arm even as he slammed the weapon\nthrough the chest of the blubbering nobleman.\nFlesh and blood puffed instantly into black smoke. Ordinary Shardblades\nburned only the eyes, but this sword somehow consumed the entire body. It\nseemed to sear away even the man’s soul.\nEVIL!\nVeins of black liquid crept up Szeth’s hand and arm. He gaped at them,\nthen gasped and rammed the sword back into its silvery sheath.\nHe fell to his knees, dropping the sword and raising his hand, fingers\nbent and tendons taut. Slowly, the blackness evaporated from his flesh, the\nawful pain easing. The skin of his hand, which had already been pale, had\nbeen bleached to grey-white.\nThe sword’s voice sank to a deep muttering in his mind, its words\nslurring. It struck him as sounding like the voice of a beast falling into a\nstupor after having gorged itself. Szeth breathed deeply. Fumbling at his\npouch, he saw that several spheres inside were completely drained. I will\nneed far more Stormlight if I’m to ever try that again.\nThe surrounding townspeople, squires, and even master Skybreakers\nregarded him with uniform horror. Szeth picked up the sword and struggled\nto his feet, before fastening the sword’s clasp. Holding the sheathed weapon\nin both hands, he bowed to Ki. “I have dealt,” he said, “with the worst of\nthe criminals.”\n“You have done well,” she said slowly, glancing at where the nobleman\nhad stood. There wasn’t even a stain on the stones. “We will wait and make\ncertain the other criminals have been killed or captured.”"

There wasn’t even a stain on the stones. “We will wait and make\ncertain the other criminals have been killed or captured.”\n“Wise,” Szeth said. “Could I … beg something to drink? I suddenly find\nmyself very thirsty.”\n* * *\nBy the time all the escapees had been accounted for, the sword was stirring\nagain. It had never fallen asleep, if a sword could do such a thing. Rather, it\nhad mumbled in his mind until it slowly became lucid.\nHey! the sword said as Szeth sat on a low wall alongside the city. Hey,\ndid you draw me?\n“I did, sword-nimi.”\nGreat job! Did we … did we destroy lots of evil?\n“A great and corrupt evil.”\nWow! I’m impressed. You know, Vivenna never drew me even once? She\ncarried me for a long time too. Maybe a couple of days even?\n“And how long have I been carrying you?”\nAt least an hour, the sword said, satisfied. One, or two, or ten thousand.\nSomething like that.\nKi approached, and he returned her water canteen. “Thank you, Master\nKi.”\n“I have decided to take you as my squire, Szeth-son-Neturo,” she said.\n“In all honesty, there was an argument among us over who would have the\nprivilege.”\nHe bowed his head. “I may swear the Second Ideal?”\n“You may. Justice will serve you until you attract a spren and swear to a\nmore specific code. During my prayers last night, Winnow proclaimed the\nhighspren are watching you. I won’t be surprised if it takes mere months\nbefore you achieve the Third Ideal.”\nMonths. No, he would not take months. But he did not swear quite yet.\nInstead, he nodded toward the prison. “Pardon, master, a question. You\nknew this breakout would happen, didn’t you?”\n“We suspected. One of our teams investigated this man and discovered\nhow he was using his funds. When the call came, we were not surprised. It\nprovided a perfect testing opportunity.”\n“Why not deal with him earlier?”\n“You must understand our purpose and our place, a fine point difficult\nfor many squires to grasp. That man had not yet broken a law. His duty was\nto imprison the convicts, which he had done. He was allowed to judge if his\nmethods were satisfactory or not. Only once he failed, and his charges had\nescaped, could we mete out justice.”\nSzeth nodded. “I swear to seek justice, to let it guide me, until I find a\nmore perfect Ideal.”\n“These Words are accepted,” Ki said. She removed a glowing emerald\nsphere from her pouch. “Take your place above, squire.”\nSzeth regarded the sphere, then—trembling—breathed in the Stormlight.\nIt returned to him in a rush.\nThe skies were his once again.\n93.

He had a crick in his\nneck and a pain in his back; he’d never mastered the “sleep anywhere” skill\nthe grunts bragged about.\nFather could have slept on the ground, a part of him thought. Dalinar is\na true soldier.\nAdolin thought again of the jolt he’d felt when ramming his dagger\nthrough Sadeas’s eye and into his brain. Satisfaction and shame. Strip away\nAdolin’s nobility, and what was left? A duelist when a world needed\ngenerals? A hothead who couldn’t even take an insult?\nA murderer?\nHe threw off his coat and sat up, then jumped and gasped as he found the\nwoman with the scratched-out eyes looming over him. “Ishar’s soul!”\nAdolin cursed. “Do you have to stay so close?”\nShe didn’t move. Adolin sighed, then changed the dressing on his\nshallow shoulder cut, using bandages from his pocket. Nearby, Shallan and\nAzure catalogued their meager supplies. Kaladin trudged over to join them.\nHad the bridgeboy slept?\nAdolin stretched, then—accompanied by his ghostly spren—walked\ndown the short slope to the ocean of glass beads. A few lifespren floated\nnearby; on this side, their glowing green motes had tufts of white hair that\nrippled as they danced and bobbed. Perhaps they were circling plants by the\nriverbank in the Physical Realm? Those small dots of light swimming\nabove the rock might be the souls of fish. How did that work? In the real\nworld, they’d be in the water, so shouldn’t they be inside the stone?\nHe knew so little, and felt so overwhelmed. So insignificant.\nA fearspren crawled up out of the ocean of beads, purple antenna\npointing at him. It scuttled closer until Adolin picked up some beads and\nthrew one at the spren, which scuttled back into the ocean and lurked there,\nwatching him.\n“What do you think of all this?” Adolin asked the woman with the\nscratched-out eyes. She didn’t respond, but he often talked to his sword\nwithout it responding.\nHe tossed up one of the beads and caught it. Shallan could tell what each\nrepresented, but all he got was a dull impression of … something red?\n“I’m being childish, aren’t I?” Adolin asked. “So, forces moving in the\nworld now make me look insignificant. That’s no different from a child\ngrowing up and realizing his little life isn’t the center of the universe.\nRight?”\nProblem was, his little life had been the center of the universe, growing\nup. Welcome to being the son of Dalinar storming Blackthorn. He hurled\nthe sphere into the sea, where it skittered against its fellows.\nAdolin sighed, then started a morning kata.

She\nwalked down the slope and fell into line beside him, doing the same kata.\nShe must have known it already, for she kept pace with him exactly.\nThey stepped back and forth along the rocks, sparring with their own\nshadows, until Kaladin approached and joined them. He wasn’t as\npracticed, and cursed under his breath as he got a sequence wrong—but\nhe’d obviously done it before too.\nHe must have learned it from Zahel, Adolin realized.\nThe three moved together, their breathing controlled, scraping boots on\nthe glass. The sea of beads rolling against itself began to sound soothing.\nEven rhythmic.\nThe world is the same as it’s always been, Adolin thought. These things\nwe’re finding—monsters and Radiants—aren’t new. They were only hidden.\nThe world has always been like this, even if I didn’t know it.\nAnd Adolin … he was still himself. He had all the same things to be\nproud of, didn’t he? Same strengths? Same accomplishments?\nSame flaws too.\n“Are you three dancing?” a voice suddenly piped up.\nAdolin immediately spun around. Shallan had settled on the slope above\nthem, still wearing her white uniform, hat, and single glove. He found\nhimself grinning stupidly. “It’s a warm-up kata,” he explained. “You—”\n“I know what it is. You tried to teach it to me, remember? I just thought\nit odd to see you all down here like that.” She shook her head. “Weren’t we\ngoing to plan how to get out of here?”\nTogether, they started up the slope, and Azure fell into step beside\nAdolin. “Where did you learn that kata?”\n“From my swordmaster. You?”\n“Likewise.”\nAs they approached their camp in the small nestlike depression in the\nobsidian ground, something felt off to Adolin. Where was his sword, the\nwoman with the scratched-out eyes?\nHe stepped back and spotted her standing on the coast, looking at her\nfeet.\n“All right,” Shallan said, drawing him back. “I made a list of our\nsupplies.” She gestured with a pencil toward the items—which were\narrayed on the ground—as she spoke. “One bag of gemstones from the\nemerald reserve. I used roughly half of our Stormlight in our transfer to\nShadesmar and crossing the sea of beads. We have my satchel, with\ncharcoal, reed pens, brushes, ink, lacquer, some solvents, three sketchpads,\nmy sharpening knife, and one jar of jam I’d stowed inside for an emergency\nsnack.”\n“Wonderful,” Kaladin said. “I’m sure a pile of brushes will be useful in\nfighting off Voidspren.”\n“Better than your tongue, which is notably dull lately.

We also have a\nwater jug and three canteens.”\n“Mine is half empty,” Adolin noted.\n“Mine too,” Azure said. “Which means we have maybe one day’s worth\nof water and three meals for four people. Last time I crossed Shadesmar, it\ntook four weeks.”\n“Obviously,” Kaladin said, “we have to get back through the Oathgate\ninto the city.”\nPattern hummed, standing behind Shallan. He seemed like a statue; he\ndidn’t shift his weight or move in small ways like a human would.\nKaladin’s spren was different. She always seemed to be moving, slipping\nthis way or that, girlish dress rippling as she walked, her hair swaying.\n“Bad,” Pattern said. “The spren of the Oathgate are bad now.”\n“Do we have any other options?” Kaladin said.\n“I remember … some,” Syl said. “Much more than I used to. Our land,\nevery land, is three realms. The highest is the Spiritual, where gods live—\nthere, all things, times, and spaces are made into one.\n“We’re now in the Cognitive Realm. Shadesmar, where spren live. You\nare from the Physical Realm. The only way I know of to transfer there is to\nbe pulled by human emotions. That won’t help you, as you’re not spren.”\n“There’s another way to transfer between realms,” Azure said. “I’ve used\nit.”\nHer hair had recovered its dark coloring, and it seemed to Adolin that her\nscars had faded. Something about her was downright strange. She seemed\nalmost like a spren herself.\nShe bore his scrutiny, looking from him to Kaladin, to Shallan. Finally\nshe sighed deeply. “Story time?”\n“Yes, please,” Adolin replied. “You’ve traveled in this place before?”\n“I’m from a far land, and I came to Roshar by crossing this place,\nShadesmar.”\n“All right,” Adolin said. “But why?”\n“I came chasing someone.”\n“A friend?”\n“A criminal,” she said softly.\n“You’re a soldier though,” Kaladin said.\n“Not really. In Kholinar, I merely stepped up to do a job nobody else was\ndoing. I thought perhaps the Wall Guard would have information on the\nman I’m hunting. Everything went wrong, and I got stuck.”\n“When you arrived in our land,” Shallan said, “you used an Oathgate to\nget from Shadesmar to the Physical Realm?”\n“No.” Azure laughed, shaking her head. “I didn’t know of those until Kal\ntold me about them. I used a portal between realms. Cultivation’s\nPerpendicularity, they call it. On your side, it’s in the Horneater Peaks.”\n“That’s hundreds of miles from here,” Adolin said.\n“There’s supposedly another perpendicularity,” Azure said. “It’s\nunpredictable and dangerous, and appears randomly in different places.

I’m just a woman who has\nbeen constantly out of her league since adolescence. Trust me.”\nAdolin glanced at Kaladin. He didn’t seem convinced either.\n“Really,” Azure said. “There’s no spren here for my Blade because it’s\nflawed. I can’t summon or dismiss it, like you can yours. She’s a handy\nweapon, but a pale copy of what you carry.” She patted it. “Anyway, when I\nlast crossed this place, I hired a ship to convey me.”\n“A ship?” Kaladin said. “Sailed by whom?”\n“Spren. I hired it at one of their cities.”\n“Cities?” Kaladin looked toward Syl. “You have cities?”\n“Where did you think we lived?” Syl said, amused.\n“Lightspren are usually guides,” Azure continued. “They like to travel,\nto see new places. They sail all across Roshar’s Shadesmar, peddling goods,\ntrading with other spren. Um … you’re supposed to watch out for\nCryptics.”\nPattern hummed happily. “Yes. We are very famous.”\n“What about using Soulcasting?” Adolin looked to Shallan. “Could you\nmake us supplies?”\n“I don’t think it would work,” Shallan replied. “When I Soulcast, I\nchange an object’s soul here in this realm, and it reflects in the other world.\nIf I changed one of these beads, it might become something new in the\nPhysical Realm—but it would still be a bead to us.”\n“Food and water aren’t impossible to find here,” Azure said, “if you can\nmake it to a port city. The spren don’t need these things, but humans living\non this side—and there are some—need a constant supply. With that\nStormlight of yours, we can trade. Maybe buy passage to the Horneater\nPeaks.”\n“That would take a long time,” Kaladin said. “Alethkar is falling right\nnow, and the Blackthorn needs us. It—”\nHe was interrupted by a haunting screech. It was reminiscent of sheets of\nsteel grinding against one another. It was met by others, echoing in unison.\nAdolin spun toward the sounds, shocked by their intensity. Syl put her\nhands to her lips, and Pattern cocked his strange head.\n“What was that?” Kaladin demanded."

Now.”\n94. A Small Bottle\nSEVEN YEARS AGO\nDalinar stumbled as he swept everything from the dresser, upending a bowl\nof hot soup. He didn’t want soup. He yanked out drawers, dumping clothing\nto the ground, steam curling from the spilled broth.\nThey’d done it again! They’d taken his bottles. How dare they! Couldn’t\nthey hear the weeping? He roared, then grabbed his trunk, overturning it. A\nflask rolled out along with the clothing. Finally! Something they hadn’t\nfound.\nHe slurped down the dregs it contained, and groaned. The weeping\nechoed around him. Children dying. Evi begging for her life.\nHe needed more.\nBut … wait, did he need to be presentable? The hunt? Was that today?\nStupid man, he thought. The last of the hunts had been weeks ago. He’d\nconvinced Gavilar to come with him out into the wilderness, and the trip\nhad gone well. Dalinar had been presentable—sober, commanding even. A\nfigure right from the storming songs. They’d discovered those parshmen.\nThey’d been so interesting.\nFor a time, away from civilization, Dalinar had felt like himself. His old\nself.\nHe hated that person.\nGrowling, he dug in his large wardrobe. This fort on the eastern rim of\nAlethkar was the first mark of civilization on their trip home. It had given\nDalinar access, again, to the necessities of life. Like wine.\nHe barely heard the rap on his door as he flung coats out of the\nwardrobe. When he looked over, he saw two youths standing there. His\nsons. Angerspren boiled around him. Her hair. Her judgmental eyes. How\nmany lies about him had she stuffed into their heads?\n“What?” Dalinar roared.\nAdolin stood his ground. Almost seventeen now, fully a man. The other\none, the invalid, cringed down. He looked younger than his … what …\ntwelve years? Thirteen?\n“We heard the commotion, sir,” Adolin said, jutting out his chin. “We\nthought you might need help.”\n“I need nothing! Out! GET OUT!”\nThey scrambled away.\nDalinar’s heart raced. He slammed the wardrobe and pounded his fists on\nthe bedside table, toppling the sphere lamp. Puffing, groaning, he fell to his\nknees.\nStorms. They were only a few days’ march from the ruins of Rathalas.\nWas that why the screaming was louder today?\nA hand fell on his shoulder. “Father?”\n“Adolin, so help me—” Still kneeling, Dalinar turned, then cut off. It\nwasn’t Adolin, but the other one. Renarin had returned, timid as always, his\nspectacled eyes wide and his hand trembling. He held something out."

He held something out.\nA small bottle. “I…” Renarin swallowed. “I got you one, with the\nspheres the king gave me. Because you always go through what you buy so\nquickly.”\nDalinar stared at that bottle of wine for an endless moment. “Gavilar\nhides the wine from me,” he mumbled. “That’s why none is left. I …\ncouldn’t possibly … have drunk it all.…”\nRenarin stepped in and hugged him. Dalinar flinched, bracing as if for a\npunch. The boy clung to him, not letting go.\n“They talk about you,” Renarin said, “but they’re wrong. You just need\nto rest, after all the fighting you did. I know. And I miss her too.”\nDalinar licked his lips. “What did she tell you?” he said, voice ragged.\n“What did your mother say about me?”\n“The only honest officer in the army,” Renarin said, “the honorable\nsoldier. Noble, like the Heralds themselves. Our father. The greatest man in\nAlethkar.”\nWhat stupid words. Yet Dalinar found himself weeping. Renarin let go,\nbut Dalinar grabbed him, pulling him close.\nOh, Almighty. Oh God. Oh God, please … I’ve started to hate my sons.\nWhy hadn’t the boys learned to hate him back? They should hate him. He\ndeserved to be hated.\nPlease. Anything. I don’t know how to get free of this. Help me. Help\nme …\nDalinar wept and clung to that youth, that child, as if he were the only\nreal thing left in a world of shadows.\n95. Inescapable Void\nYelig-nar had great powers, perhaps the powers of all Surges\ncompounded in one. He could transform any Voidbringer into an\nextremely dangerous enemy. Curiously, three legends I found mention\nswallowing a gemstone to engage this process.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 27\nKaladin marched at speed through Shadesmar, trying—with difficulty—to\ncontrol the simmering dissatisfaction inside of him.\n“Mmmm…” Pattern said as another screech sounded behind them.\n“Humans, you must stop your emotions. They are very inconvenient here.”\nThe group hiked southward, along the narrow line of land that overlaid\nthe river in the real world. Shallan was the slowest of them, and had\ndifficulty keeping up, so they’d agreed she should hold a little Stormlight. It\nwas either that, or let the screeching spren reach them.\n“What are they like?” Adolin said to Azure, puffing as they marched.\n“You said those sounds were from angerspren? Boiling pools of blood?”\n“That’s the part you see in the Physical Realm,” Azure said. “Here …\nthat’s merely their saliva, pooling as they drool. They’re nasty.”\n“And dangerous,” Syl said. She scampered along the obsidian ground,\nand didn’t seem to get tired. “Even to spren. But how did we draw them?\nNobody was angry, right?”\nKaladin tried again to smother his frustration.\n“I wasn’t feeling anything other than tired,” Shallan said."

But not angry.”\n“Kaladin?” Syl said.\nHe looked at the others, then down at his feet. “It just feels like … like\nwe’re abandoning Kholinar. And only I care. You were talking about how to\nget food, find a way to the Horneater Peaks, this perpendicularity or\nwhatever. But we’re abandoning people to the Voidbringers.”\n“I care too!” Adolin said. “Bridgeboy, that was my home. It—”\n“I know,” Kaladin snapped. He took a breath, forcing himself to calm. “I\nknow, Adolin. I know it’s not rational to try to get back through the\nOathgate. We don’t know how to work it from this side, and besides, it’s\nobviously been corrupted. My emotions are irrational. I’ll try to contain\nthem. I promise.”\nThey fell silent.\nYou’re not angry at Adolin, Kaladin thought forcefully. You’re not\nactually angry at anyone. You’re just looking for something to latch on to.\nSomething to feel.\nBecause the darkness was coming.\nIt fed off the pain of defeat, the agony of losing men he’d tried to protect.\nBut it could feed off anything. Life going well? The darkness would\nwhisper that he was only setting himself up for a bigger fall. Shallan\nglances at Adolin? They must be whispering about him. Dalinar sends him\nto protect Elhokar? The highprince must want to get rid of Kaladin.\nHe’d failed at that, regardless. When Dalinar heard that Kholinar had\nfallen …\nGet out, Kaladin thought, squeezing his eyes shut. Get out, get out, get\nout!\nIt would continue until numbness seemed preferable. Then that\nnumbness would claim him and make it hard to do anything at all. It would\nbecome a sinking, inescapable void from within which everything looked\nwashed out. Dead.\nWithin that dark place, he’d wanted to betray his oaths. Within that dark\nplace, he’d given the king up to assassins and murderers.\nEventually, the screeches faded into the distance. Syl guessed that the\nangerspren had been drawn into the beads, off toward Kholinar and the\npowerful emotions there. The group continued their hike. There was only\none way to go: south, along the narrow peninsula of obsidian running\nthrough the bead ocean.\n“When I traveled here last time,” Azure said, “we passed numbers of\npeninsulas like this one. They always had lighthouses at the ends. We\nstopped at them sometimes for supplies.”\n“Yes…” Syl said, nodding. “I remember those. It’s useful for ships to\nnote where land juts into the beads. There should be one at the end of this\none … though it looks loooong. We’ll have to hike it for several days.”\n“At least it’s a goal,” Adolin said. “We travel south, get to the lighthouse,\nand hope to catch a ship there.”\nThere was an insufferable spring to his step, like he was actually excited\nby this terrible place.

Idiot Adolin, who probably didn’t even understand the\nconsequences of—\nStop it. STOP IT. He helped you.\nStorms. Kaladin hated himself when he got like this. When he tried to\nempty his mind, he drifted toward the void of darkness. But when he\ninstead let himself think, he started remembering what had happened in\nKholinar. Men he loved, killing each other. Awful, terrifying perspective.\nHe could see too many sides. Parshmen angry at being enslaved for\nyears, attempting to overthrow a corrupt government. Alethi protecting their\nhomes from invading monsters. Elhokar trying to save his son. The palace\nguards trying to keep their oaths.\nToo many eyes to see through. Too many emotions. Were these his only\ntwo options? Pain or oblivion?\nFight it.\nTheir hike continued, and he tried to turn his attention to his\nsurroundings instead of his thoughts. The thin peninsula wasn’t barren, as\nhe’d first assumed. Growing along its edges were small, brittle plants that\nlooked like ferns. When he asked, Syl told him they grew exactly like plants\nin the Physical Realm.\nMost were black, but occasionally they had vibrant colors, blended\ntogether like stained glass. None grew higher than his knees, and most only\nreached his ankles. He felt terrible whenever he brushed one and it\ncrumpled.\nThe sun didn’t seem to change position in the sky, no matter how long\nthey walked. Through spaces between the clouds, he saw only blackness.\nNo stars, no moons. Eternal, endless darkness.\n* * *\nThey camped for what should have been the night, then hiked all the next\nday. Kholinar vanished into the distance behind, but still they kept going:\nAzure at the front, then Pattern, Syl, and Kaladin, with Shallan and Adolin\nat the back, Adolin’s spren trailing them. Kaladin would have preferred to\ntake the rearguard, but if he tried, Adolin positioned himself to the back\nagain. What did the princeling think? That Kaladin would lag behind, if not\nminded?\nSyl walked beside him, mostly quiet. Being back on this side troubled\nher. She’d look at things, like the occasional colorful plant, and cock her\nhead as if trying to remember. “It’s like a dream from the time when I was\ndead,” she’d said when he prompted her.\nThey camped another “night,” then started walking again. Kaladin\nskipped breakfast—their rations were basically gone. Besides, he welcomed\nthe grumbling stomach. It reminded him that he was alive. Gave him\nsomething to think about, other than the men he’d lost …\n“Where did you live?” he asked Syl, still carrying his pack, hiking along\nthe seemingly infinite peninsula. “When you were young, on this side?”\n“It was far to the west,” she said. “A grand city, ruled by honorspren! I\ndidn’t like it though. I wanted to travel, but Father kept me in the city,\nespecially after … you know…”\n“I’m not actually sure that I do.”\n“I bonded a Knight Radiant.

In one battle. And he died.…”\nShe blinked open her eyes. “That was a long time ago.”\n“I’m sorry.”\n“It’s all right. I wasn’t ready though for the bond. Spren normally\nweather the death of their Radiant, but I … I lost myself when I lost him. It\nall turned out to be morbidly fortuitous, because soon after, the Recreance\nhappened. Men forsook their oaths, which killed my siblings. I survived, for\nI didn’t have a bond then.”\n“And the Stormfather locked you away?”\n“Father assumed I’d been killed with the others. He found me, asleep,\nafter what must have been … wow, a thousand years on your side. He woke\nme and took me home.” She shrugged. “After that, he wouldn’t let me leave\nthe city.” She took Kaladin by the arm. “He was foolish, as were the other\nhonorspren born after the Recreance. They knew something bad was\ncoming, but wouldn’t do anything. And I heard you calling, even from so\nfar away.…”\n“The Stormfather let you out?” Kaladin said, stunned by the confessions.\nThis was more than he’d found out about her since … since forever.\n“I snuck away,” she said with a grin. “I gave up my mind and joined\nyour world, hiding among the windspren. We can barely see them on this\nside. Did you know that? Some spren live mostly in your realm. I suppose\nthe wind is always there somewhere, so they don’t fade like passions do.”\nShe shook her head. “Oh!”\n“Oh?” Kaladin asked. “Did you remember something?”\n“No! Oh!” She pointed, hopping up and down. “Look!”\nIn the distance, a bright yellow light glowed like a spark in the otherwise\ndim landscape.\nA lighthouse.\n96. Pieces of a Fabrial\nYelig-nar is said to consume souls, but I can’t find a specific\nexplanation. I’m uncertain this lore is correct.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 51\nOn the day of the first meeting of monarchs at Urithiru, Navani made each\nperson—no matter how important—carry their own chair. The old Alethi\ntradition symbolized each chief bringing important wisdom to a gathering.\nNavani and Dalinar arrived first, stepping off the lift and walking toward\nthe meeting room near the top of Urithiru. Her chair was sensible but\ncomfortable, made of Soulcast wood with a padded seat. Dalinar had tried\nto bring a stool, but she’d insisted that he do better. This wasn’t a battlefield\nstrategy tent, and forced austerity wouldn’t impress the monarchs.

When Dalinar was\ntroubled, he went silent. His brow would scrunch up in thought, and to\neveryone else, it looked like he was scowling.\n“They got out, Dalinar,” Navani said to him. “I’m sure they did. Elhokar\nand Adolin are safe, somewhere.”\nHe nodded. But even if they had survived, Kholinar had fallen. Was that\nwhy he seemed so haunted?\nNo, it was something else. Ever since he’d collapsed after visiting Azir,\nit seemed that something in Dalinar had snapped. This morning, he had\nquietly asked her to lead the meeting. She worried, deeply, for what was\nhappening to him. And for Elhokar. And for Kholinar …\nBut storms, they had worked so hard to forge this coalition. She would\nnot let it collapse now. She’d already grieved for a daughter, but then that\ndaughter had returned to her. She had to hope the same for Elhokar—at the\nvery least, so she could keep functioning while Dalinar mourned.\nThey settled their chairs in the large meeting room, which had a clear\nview out flat glass windows overlooking mountains. Servants had already\nset out refreshment along the curved side wall of the half-circle room. The\ntiled floor was inlaid with the image of the Double Eye of the Almighty,\ncomplete with Surges and Essences.\nBridge Four piled into the room after them. Many had brought simple\nseats, but the Herdazian had stumbled onto the lift with a chair so grand—\ninlaid with embroidered blue cloth and silver—it was almost a throne.\nThey settled their chairs behind hers with a fair bit of squabbling, and\nthen attacked the food without waiting for permission. For a group that was\nessentially one step from being lighteyed Shardbearers, they were an unruly\nand raucous bunch.\nBridge Four had, characteristically, taken the news of their leader’s\npotential fall with laughter. Kaladin is tougher than a wind-tossed boulder,\nBrightness, Teft had told her. He survived Bridge Four, he survived the\nchasms, and he’ll survive this.\nShe had to admit their optimism was heartening. But if the team had\nsurvived, why hadn’t they returned during the latest highstorm?\nSteady, Navani thought to herself, regarding the bridgemen, who were\nsurrounded by laughterspren. One of those men currently carried\nJezerezeh’s Honorblade. She couldn’t tell which; the Blade could be\ndismissed like an ordinary Shardblade, and they swapped it among\nthemselves in order to be unpredictable.\nSoon, the others began arriving on different lifts, and Navani watched\ncarefully. The chair-carrying tradition was, in part, a symbol of equality—\nbut Navani figured she might be able to learn something about the monarchs\nfrom their choices.

His tailor had done a\nwonderful job making his regal costume fit; it would have been easy for the\nyouth to look like a child swimming in those stately robes and that\nheaddress. He carried a very ornate throne, covered in loud Azish patterns,\nand each of his closest advisors helped by holding it with one hand.\nThe large contingent settled in, and others flooded in behind, including\nthree representatives of kingdoms subject to Azir: the prime of Emul, the\nprincess of Yezier, and the ambassador from Tashikk. All brought chairs that\nwere faintly inferior to that of the Azish Prime.\nA balancing act went on here. Each of the three monarchies gave just\nenough respect to the Prime so as not to embarrass him. They were his\nsubjects in name only. Still, Navani should be able to focus her diplomacy\nefforts on the Prime. Tashikk, Emul, and Yezier would fall in line. Two were\nhistorically closest with the Azish throne, and the third—Emul—was in no\nposition to stand on its own after the war with Tukar and the Voidbringer\nassault had basically broken the princedom into pieces.\nThe Alethi contingent arrived next. Renarin, who seemed terrified that\nsomething had happened to his brother, brought a simple chair. Jasnah had\noutdone him by actually bringing a padded stool—she and Dalinar could be\npainfully similar. Navani noticed with annoyance that Sebarial and Palona\nweren’t with the other highprinces. Well, at least they hadn’t shown up\nbearing massage tables.\nNotably, Ialai Sadeas ignored the requirement that she carry her own\nchair. A scarred guardsman placed a sleek, lacquered chair down for her—\nstained so dark a maroon, it might as well have been black. She met\nNavani’s eyes as she sat, cold and confident. Amaram was technically\nhighprince, but he was still in Thaylenah, working alongside his soldiers to\nrebuild the city. Navani doubted Ialai would have let him represent them at\nthis meeting anyway.\nIt seemed so long ago when Ialai and Navani had huddled together at\ndinners, conspiring on how to stabilize the kingdom their husbands were\nconquering. Now, Navani wanted to seize the woman and shake her. Can’t\nyou stop being petty for one storming minute?\nWell, as had been happening for so long now, the other highprinces\nwould defer either to Kholin or to Sadeas. Letting Ialai participate was a\ncalculated risk. Forbid her, and the woman would find a way to sabotage the\nproceedings. Let her in, and hopefully she’d start to see the importance of\nthis work.\nAt least Queen Fen and her consort seemed committed to the coalition.\nThey set their chairs by the glass window, backs to the storms, as the\nThaylens often joked. Their wooden chairs were high-backed, painted blue,\nand upholstered a pale nautical white. Taravangian—bearing a nondescript\nchair of wood with no padding—asked to join them.

The old man had\ninsisted on carrying his own chair, though Navani had specifically excused\nhim, Ashno of Sages, and others with a frail bearing.\nAdrotagia sat with him, as did his Surgebinder. She didn’t go join Bridge\nFour … and, curiously, Navani realized she still thought of the woman as\nhis Surgebinder.\nThe only other person of note was Au-nak, the Natan ambassador. He\nrepresented a dead kingdom that had been reduced to a single city-state on\nthe eastern coast of Roshar with a few other cities as protectorates.\nFor a moment, it all seemed too much for Navani. The Azish Empire,\nwith all its intricacies. The countermovement among the Alethi highprinces.\nTaravangian, who was somehow king of Jah Keved—the second-largest\nkingdom on Roshar. Queen Fen and her obligation to the guilds in her city.\nThe Radiants—like the little Reshi who was currently outeating the huge\nHorneater bridgeman, almost as if it were a contest.\nSo much to think about. Now was when Dalinar stepped back?\nCalm, Navani thought at herself, taking a deep breath. Order from chaos.\nFind the structure here and start building upon it.\nEveryone had naturally arranged themselves into a circle, with monarchs\nat the front and highprinces, viziers, interpreters, and scribes radiating out\nfrom them. Navani stood up and strode into the center. Just as everyone was\nquieting, Sebarial and his mistress finally sauntered in. They made right for\nthe food, and had apparently forgotten chairs entirely.\n“I,” she said as the room hushed again, “know of no other conference\nlike this in the history of Roshar. Perhaps they were common in the days of\nthe Knights Radiant, but certainly nothing like it has occurred since the\nRecreance. I would like to both welcome and thank you, our noble guests.\nToday we make history.”\n“It only took a Desolation to cause it,” Sebarial said from the food table.\n“The world should end more often. It makes everyone so much more\naccommodating.”\nThe various interpreters whispered translations to their charges. Navani\nfound herself wondering if it was too late to have him tossed off the tower.\nYou could do it—the sheer side of Urithiru, facing the Origin, was straight\nall the way down. She could watch Sebarial fall practically to the bottom of\nthe mountains, if she wanted.\n“We,” Navani said sharply, “are here to discuss the future of Roshar. We\nmust have a unified vision and goal.”\nShe glanced around the room as people considered. He’s going to talk\nfirst, she thought, noticing the prime of Emul shifting in his seat. His name\nwas Vexil the Wise, but people often referred to the Makabaki princes and\nprimes by their country, much as Alethi highprinces were often referred to\nby their house name.\n“The course is obvious, isn’t it?” Emul said through an interpreter,\nthough Navani understood his Azish. He bowed in his seat to the Azish\nchild emperor, then continued. “We must reclaim my nation from the hands"

It is completely\nunreasonable to allow this insane man, who claims to be a god, to continue\nbereaving the glorious Azish Empire.”\nThis is going to get difficult, Navani thought as a half dozen other people\nstarted to speak at once. She raised her freehand. “I will do my best to\nmoderate fairly, Your Majesties, but do realize that I am only one person. I\ndepend upon you all to facilitate the discussion, rather than trying to talk\nover one another.”\nShe nodded at the Azish Prime, hoping he’d take the floor. A translator\nwhispered her words into the Prime’s left ear; then Noura the vizier leaned\nforward and spoke quietly into the other, undoubtedly giving instructions.\nThey’ll want to see how this plays out, Navani decided. One of the others\nwill speak next. They’ll want to contrast the Emuli position, to assert\nthemselves.\n“The throne recognizes the prime of Emul,” the little emperor finally\nsaid. “And, er, we are aware of his desires.” He paused and looked around.\n“Um, anyone else have a comment?”\n“My brother the prince wishes to address you,” said the tall, refined\nrepresentative from Tashikk, who wore a flowery suit of yellow and gold\nrather than his people’s traditional wrap. A scribe whispered to him as a\nspanreed scratched out the message Tashikk’s prince wanted conveyed to\nthe gathering.\nHe’ll contradict Emul, Navani thought. Point us in another direction.\nToward Iri maybe?\n“We of Tashikk,” the ambassador said, “are more interested in the\ndiscovery of these glorious portals. The Alethi have invited us here and told\nus we’re part of a grand coalition. We would respectfully inquire how often\nwe will have use of these gates, and how to negotiate tariffs.”\nImmediately, the room exploded with conversation.\n“Our gate,” Au-nak said, “in our historical homeland is being used\nwithout our permission. And while we thank the Alethi for securing it for us\n—”\n“If there is to be war,” Fen said, “then it’s a bad time to be discussing\ntariffs. We should just agree to free trade.”\n“Which would help your merchants, Fen,” Sebarial called. “How about\nasking them to help the rest of us out with some free wartime supplies?”\n“Emul—” the Emuli Prime began.\n“Wait,” the Yezier princess said. “Shouldn’t we be concerned about Iri\nand Rira, who seem to have completely fallen in with the enemy?”\n“Please,” Navani said, interrupting the mess of conversations. “Please.\nLet’s do this in an orderly way. Perhaps before deciding where to fight, we\ncould discuss how to best equip ourselves against the enemy threat?” She\nlooked to Taravangian. “Your Majesty, can you tell us more about the\nshields your scholars in Jah Keved are creating?”\n“Yes.

        "text": "shields your scholars in Jah Keved are creating?”\n“Yes. They … they are strong.”\n“… How strong?” Navani prompted.\n“Very strong. Er, yes. Strong enough.” He scratched his head and looked\nat her helplessly. “How … how strong do you need them to be?”\nShe drew in a deep breath. He wasn’t having a good day. Her mother had\nbeen like that, lucid on some days, barely cognizant on others.\n“The half-shards,” Navani said, addressing the room, “will give us an\nedge against the enemy. We have given the plans to the Azish scholars; I’m\nlooking forward to pooling our resources and studying the process.”\n“Could it lead to Shardplate?” Queen Fen asked.\n“Possibly,” Navani said. “But the more I study what we’ve discovered\nhere in Urithiru, the more I’ve come to realize that our image of the\nancients having fantastic technology was deeply flawed. An exaggeration at\nbest, perhaps a fancy.”\n“But Shards…” Fen said.\n“Manifestations of spren,” Jasnah explained. “Not fabrial technology.\nEven the gemstones we discovered, containing words of ancient Radiants\nduring the days when they left Urithiru, were crude—if used in a way we\nhadn’t yet explored. All this time we’ve been assuming that we lost great\ntechnology in the Desolations, but it seems we are far, far more advanced\nthan the ancients ever were. It is the process of bonding spren that we lost.”\n“Not lost,” the Azish Prime said. “Abandoned.”\nHe looked toward Dalinar, who sat in a relaxed posture. Not slumped,\nbut not stiff either—a posture that somehow read as, “I’m in control here.\nDon’t pretend otherwise.” Dalinar loomed over a room even when trying to\nbe unobtrusive. That furrowed brow darkened his blue eyes, and the way he\nrubbed his chin evoked the image of a man contemplating whom to execute\nfirst.\nThe attendees had arranged their seats roughly in a circle, but most of\nthem faced Dalinar, who sat by Navani’s chair. After everything that had\nhappened, they didn’t trust him.\n“The ancient oaths are spoken once more,” Dalinar said. “We are again\nRadiant. This time, we will not abandon you. I vow it.”\nNoura the vizier whispered in the Azish Prime’s ear, and he nodded\nbefore speaking. “We are still very concerned about the powers in which\nyou dabble. These abilities … who is to say that the Lost Radiants were\nwrong in abandoning them? They were frightened of something, and they\nlocked these portals for a reason.”\n“It is too late to turn back from this now, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “I\nhave bonded the Stormfather himself. We must either use these abilities, or\ncrumple beneath the invasion.”\nThe Prime sat back, and his attendants seemed … concerned. They\nwhispered among themselves.\nBring order from the chaos, Navani thought. She gestured toward the\nbridgemen and Lift. “I understand your concern, but surely you have read\nour reports of the oaths these Radiants follow. Protection. Remembering the\nfallen. Those oaths are proof that our cause is just, our Radiants trustworthy."

Those oaths are proof that our cause is just, our Radiants trustworthy.\nThe powers are in safe hands, Your Majesty.”\n“I think,” Ialai declared, “we should stop dancing around and patting\nourselves on the back.”\nNavani spun to face Ialai. Don’t sabotage this, she thought, meeting the\nwoman’s eyes. Don’t you dare.\n“We are here,” Ialai continued, “to focus our attention. We should be\ndiscussing where to invade to gain the best position for an extended war.\nObviously, there is only one answer. Shinovar is a bounteous land. Their\norchards grow without end; the land is so mild that even the grass has\ngrown relaxed and fat. We should seize that land to supply our armies.”\nThe others in the room nodded as if this were a perfectly acceptable line\nof conversation. With one targeted arrow, Ialai Sadeas proved what\neveryone whispered—that the Alethi were building a coalition to conquer\nthe world, not just protect it.\n“The Shin mountains present a historical problem,” said the Tashikki\nambassador. “Attacking across or through them is basically impossible.”\n“We have the Oathgates now,” Fen said. “Not to bring up that particular\nproblem again, but has anyone investigated whether the Shin one can be\nopened? Having Shinovar as a redoubt, difficult to invade conventionally,\nwould help secure our position.”\nNavani cursed Ialai softly. This would only reinforce the Azish worry\nthat the gates were dangerous. She tried to rein the discussion in, but it\nslipped away from her again.\n“We need to know what the Oathgates do!” Tashikk was saying. “Could\nthe Alethi not share with us everything they’ve discovered regarding them?”\n“What about your people?” Aladar shot back. “They are the great traders\nin information. Could you share with us your secrets?”\n“All Tashikki information is freely available.”\n“At a huge price.”\n“We need—”\n“But Emul—”\n“This whole thing is going to be a mess,” Fen said. “I can see it already.\nWe need to be able to trade freely, and Alethi greed could destroy this.”\n“Alethi greed?” Ialai demanded. “Are you trying to see how far you can\npush us? Because I assure you Dalinar Kholin will not be intimidated by a\nbunch of merchants and bankers.”\n“Please,” Navani said into the growing uproar. “Quiet.”\nNobody seemed to notice. Navani breathed out, then cleared her mind.\nOrder from chaos. How could she bring order to this chaos? She stopped\nfretting, and tried to listen to them. She studied the chairs they’d brought,\nthe tone of their voices. Their fears, hidden behind what they demanded or\nrequested.\nThe shape of it started to make sense to her. Right now, this room was\nfull of building materials. Pieces of a fabrial. Each monarch, each kingdom,\nwas one piece. Dalinar had gathered them, but he hadn’t formed them.\nNavani stepped up to the Azish Prime.

People quieted as, shockingly, she\nbowed to him.\n“Your Excellency,” she said, upon rising. “What would you say is the\nAzish people’s greatest strength?”\nHe glanced at his advisors as her words were translated, but they gave\nhim no answer. Rather, they seemed curious to know what he’d say.\n“Our laws,” he finally replied.\n“Your famed bureaucracy,” Navani said. “Your clerks and scribes—and\nby extension, the great information centers of Tashikk, the timekeepers and\nstormwardens of Yezier, the Azish legions. You are the greatest organizers\non Roshar. I’ve long envied your orderly approach to the world.”\n“Perhaps this is why your essay was so well received, Brightness\nKholin,” the emperor said, sounding completely sincere.\n“In light of your skill, I wonder. Would anyone in this room complain if\na specific task were assigned to your scribes? We need procedures. A code\nof how our kingdoms are to interact, and how we’re to share resources.\nWould you of Azir be willing to create this?”\nThe viziers looked shocked, then immediately began talking to one\nanother in hushed, excited tones. The looks of delight on their faces were\nenough proof that yes indeed, they’d be willing.\n“Now, wait,” Fen interjected. “Are you talking of laws? That we all have\nto follow?” Au-nak nodded eagerly in agreement.\n“More and less than laws,” Navani said. “We need codes to guide our\ninteractions—as proven by today. We must have procedures on how we\nhold meetings, how to give each person a turn. How we share information.”\n“I don’t know if Thaylenah can agree to even that.”\n“Well, surely you’d want to see what the codes contained first, Queen\nFen,” Navani said, strolling toward her. “After all, we are going to need to\nadministrate trade through the Oathgates. I wonder, who has excellent\nexpertise in shipping, caravans, and trade in general…?”\n“You’d give that to us?” Fen asked, completely taken aback.\n“It seems logical.”\nSebarial choked softly on the snacks he’d been eating, and Palona\npounded him on the back. He’d wanted that job. That will teach you to\nshow up late to my meeting and make only wisecracks, Navani noted.\nShe glanced at Dalinar, who seemed worried. Well, he always seemed\nworried lately.\n“I’m not giving you the Oathgates,” Navani said to Fen. “But someone\nhas to oversee trade and supplies. It would be a natural match for the\nThaylen merchants—so long as a fair agreement can be reached.”\n“Huh,” Fen said, settling back. She glanced at her consort, who\nshrugged.\n“And the Alethi?” the petite Yezier princess asked. “What of you?”\n“Well, we do excel at one thing,” Navani said. She looked to Emul.\n“Would you accept help from our generals and armies to help you secure\nwhat is left of your kingdom?”\n“By every Kadasix that has ever been holy!” Emul said. “Yes, of course!\nPlease.”\n“I have several scribes who are experts in fortification,” Aladar"

Tukar, Iri, Shinovar … each of these looks tempting to attack, but what\ngood will that do if we stretch ourselves too far? We should focus on\nsecuring our lands as they now stand.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “We shouldn’t be asking ourselves, ‘Where should\nwe strike?’ but instead, ‘Where will our enemy strike next?’ ”\n“They’ve secured three positions,” Highprince Aladar said. “Iri,\nMarat … and Alethkar.”\n“But you sent an expedition,” Fen said. “To reclaim Alethkar.”\nNavani caught her breath, glancing at Dalinar. He nodded slowly.\n“Alethkar has fallen,” Navani said. “The expedition failed. Our\nhomeland is overrun.”\nNavani had expected this to prompt another burst of conversation, but\ninstead it was greeted only by stunned silence.\nJasnah continued for her. “The last of our armies have retreated into\nHerdaz or Jah Keved, harried and confused by enemies who can fly—or by\nthe sudden attacks of shock troops of parshmen. Our only holdouts are on\nthe southern border, by the sea. Kholinar has fallen completely; the\nOathgate is lost to us. We’ve locked it on our side, so that it cannot be used\nto reach Urithiru.”\n“I’m sorry,” Fen said.\n“My daughter is correct,” Navani said, trying to project strength while\nadmitting that they had become a nation of refugees. “We should apply our\nefforts first toward making sure no more nations fall.”\n“My homeland—” the prime of Emul began.\n“No,” Noura said in thickly accented Alethi. “I’m sorry, but no. If the\nVoidbringers had wanted your last nibble of land, Vexil, they’d have taken\nit. The Alethi can help you secure what you have, and it seems generous of\nthem to do so. The enemy brushed past you to gather in Marat, conquering\nonly what was necessary on the way. Their eyes are turned elsewhere.”\n“Oh my!” Taravangian said. “Could they … be coming for me?”\n“It does seem a reasonable assumption,” Au-nak said. “The Veden civil\nwar left the country in ruin, and the border between Alethkar and Jah Keved\nis porous.”\n“Maybe,” Dalinar said. “I’ve fought on that border. It’s not as easy a\nbattlefield as it would seem.”\n“We must defend Jah Keved,” Taravangian said. “When the king gave\nme the throne, I promised I’d care for his people.

She stepped back\ninto the center of the room. “We won’t allow that to happen, will we?”\n“I will send troops to your aid, Taravangian,” Dalinar said. “But one\narmy can be construed as an invading force, and I am not intending to\ninvade my allies, even in appearance. Can we not mortar this alliance with a\nshow of solidarity? Will anyone else help?”\nThe Azish Prime regarded Dalinar. Behind him, the viziers and scions\nconducted a private conversation by writing on pads of paper. When they\nfinished, Vizier Noura leaned forward and whispered to the emperor, who\nnodded.\n“We will send five battalions to Jah Keved,” he said. “This will prove an\nimportant test of mobility through the Oathgates. King Taravangian, you\nwill have the support of Azir.”\nNavani released a long breath in relief.\nShe gave leave for the meeting to take a pause, so that people could\nenjoy refreshment—though most would probably spend it strategizing or\nrelaying events to their various allies. The highprinces became a flurry of\nmotion, breaking into individual houses to converse.\nNavani settled down in her seat beside Dalinar.\n“You’ve promised away a great deal,” he noted. “Giving Fen control of\ntrade and supply?”\n“Administration is different from control,” Navani said. “But either way,\ndid you think you were going to make this coalition work without giving\nsomething up?”\n“No. Of course not.” He stared outward. That haunted expression made\nher shiver. What did you remember, Dalinar? And what did the\nNightwatcher do to you?\nThey needed the Blackthorn. She needed the Blackthorn. His strength to\nquiet the sick worry inside of her, his will to forge this coalition. She took\nhis hand in hers, but he stiffened, then stood up. He did that whenever he\nfelt he was growing too relaxed. It was as if he was looking for danger to\nface.\nShe stood up beside him. “We need to get you out of the tower,” she\ndecided. “To get a new perspective. Visit someplace new.”\n“That,” Dalinar said, voice hoarse, “would be good.”\n“Taravangian was speaking of having you tour Vedenar personally. If\nwe’re going to send Kholin troops into the kingdom, it would make sense\nfor you to get a feel for the situation there.”\n“Very well.”\nThe Azish called for her, asking for clarification on what direction she\nwanted them to take with their coalition bylaws. She left Dalinar, but\ncouldn’t leave off worrying about him. She’d have to burn a glyphward\ntoday. A dozen of them, for Elhokar and the others. Except … part of the\nproblem was that Dalinar claimed nobody was watching the prayers as they\nburned, sending twisting smoke to the Tranquiline Halls. Did she believe\nthat?

They spoke\nextensively of her ability to corrupt spren, though only “lesser” spren\n—whatever that means.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 89\nKaladin remembered holding a dying woman’s hand.\nIt had been during his days as a slave. He remembered crouching in the\ndarkness, thick forest underbrush scratching his skin, the night around him\ntoo quiet. The animals had fled; they knew something was wrong.\nThe other slaves didn’t whisper, shift, or cough in their hiding places.\nHe’d taught them well.\nWe have to go. Have to move.\nHe tugged on Nalma’s hand. He’d promised to help the older woman\nfind her husband, who had been sold to another household. That wasn’t\nsupposed to be legal, but you could get away with doing all kinds of things\nto slaves with the right brands, especially if they were foreign.\nShe resisted his tug, and he could understand her hesitance. The\nunderbrush was safe, for the moment. It was also too obvious. The\nbrightlords had chased them in circles for days, getting closer and closer.\nStay here, and the slaves would be captured.\nHe tugged again, and she passed the signal to the next slave, all the way\ndown the line. Then she clung to his hand as he led them—as quietly as he\ncould—toward where he remembered a game trail.\nGet away.\nFind freedom. Find honor again.\nIt had to be out there somewhere.\nThe snapping sound of the trap closing sent a jolt through Kaladin. A\nyear later, he’d still wonder how he missed stepping in it himself.\nIt got Nalma instead. She yanked her hand from his as she screamed.\nHunters’ horns moaned in the night. Light burst from newly unshielded\nlanterns, showing men in uniforms among the trees. The other slaves broke,\nbursting out of the underbrush like game for sport. Next to Kaladin,\nNalma’s leg was caught in a fierce steel trap—a thing of springs and jaws\nthat they wouldn’t even use on a beast, for fear of ruining the sport. Her\ntibia jutted through her skin.\n“Oh, Stormfather,” Kaladin whispered as painspren writhed around\nthem. “Stormfather!” He tried to stanch the blood, but it spurted between\nhis fingers. “Stormfather, no. Stormfather!”\n“Kaladin,” she said through clenched teeth. “Kaladin, run…”\nArrows cut down several of the fleeing slaves. Traps caught two others.\nIn the distance, a voice called, “Wait! That’s my property you’re cutting\ndown.”\n“A necessity, Brightlord,” a stronger voice said. The local highlord.\n“Unless you want to encourage more of this behavior.”\nSo much blood. Kaladin uselessly made a bandage as Nalma tried to\npush him away, to make him run. He took her hand and held it instead,\nweeping as she died.\nAfter killing the others, the brightlords found him still kneeling there.\nAgainst reason, they spared him.

They said it was because he hadn’t run\nwith the others, but in truth they’d needed someone to bear warning to the\nother slaves.\nRegardless of the reason, Kaladin had lived.\nHe always did.\n* * *\nThere was no underbrush here in Shadesmar, but those old instincts served\nKaladin well as he crept toward the lighthouse. He’d suggested that he\nscout ahead, as he didn’t trust this dark land. The others had agreed. With\nLashings, he could get away most easily in an emergency—and neither\nAdolin nor Azure had experience scouting. Kaladin didn’t mention that\nmost of his practice sneaking had come as a runaway slave.\nHe focused on staying low to the ground, trying to use rifts in the black\nstone to hide his approach. Fortunately, stepping silently wasn’t difficult on\nthis glassy ground.\nThe lighthouse was a large stone tower topped by an enormous bonfire.\nIt threw a flagrant orange glow over the point of the peninsula. Where did\nthey get the fuel for that thing?\nHe drew closer, accidentally startling a burst of lifespren, which shot up\nfrom some crystalline plants, then floated back down. He froze, but heard\nno sounds from the lighthouse.\nOnce he got a little closer, he settled down to watch for a while, to see if\nhe could spot anything suspicious. He sorely missed the diaphanous form\nSyl had in the Physical Realm; she could have reported back to the others\nwhat he’d seen, or even scouted into the building herself, invisible to all but\nthe right eyes.\nAfter a short time, something crawled out of the beads of the ocean near\nhim: a round lurglike creature with a fat, bulbous body and squat legs.\nAbout the size of a toddler, it hopped close to him, then tipped the entire top\nhalf of its head backward. A long tongue shot up in the air from the gaping\nmouth; it began to flap and wave.\nStorms. An anticipationspren? They looked like streamers on his side,\nbut those … those were waving tongues? What other simple, stable parts of\nhis life were complete lies?\nTwo more anticipationspren joined the first, clustering near him and\ndeploying their long, wagging tongues. He kicked at them. “Shoo.”\nDeceptively solid, they refused to budge, so he tried calming himself,\nhoping it would banish them. Finally, he just continued forward, his three\nbothersome attendants hopping behind. That sorely undermined the stealth\nof his approach, making him more nervous—which in turn made the\nanticipationspren even more eager to stick with him.\nHe managed to reach the wall of the tower, where he might have\nexpected the heat of the enormous fire to be oppressive. Instead, he could\nbarely feel it. Notably, the flames caused his shadow to behave normally,\nextending behind him instead of pointing toward the sun.\nHe took a breath, then glanced up through the open-shuttered window,\ninto the ground floor of the lighthouse.\nInside, he saw an old Shin man—with furrowed, wrinkled skin and a\ncompletely bald head—sitting in a chair, reading by spherelight. A human?"

Those stupid anticipationspren\ncontinued to crowd nearby, but their tongues shouldn’t be visible through\nthe window—\n“Hello?” an accented voice called from inside the lighthouse. “Who’s out\nthere? Show yourself!”\nKaladin sighed, then stood up. So much for his promise to do some\nstealthy reconnaissance.\n* * *\nShallan waited with the others in the shadow of a strange rock growth. It\nlooked something like a mushroom made from obsidian, the height of a\ntree; she thought she’d seen its like before, during one of her glimpses into\nShadesmar. Pattern said it was alive, but “very, very slow.”\nThe group waited, pensive, as Kaladin scouted. She hated sending him\nalone, but Shallan knew nothing about that sort of work. Veil did.

Accept the pain, but don’t accept that\nyou deserved it.…\nShe sighed, then got out her sketchbook and started drawing some of the\nspren they’d seen.\n“So,” Syl said, sitting on a rock nearby and swinging her legs. “I’ve\nalways wondered. Does the world look weird to you, or normal?”\n“Weird,” Pattern said. “Mmm. Same as for everyone.”\n“I guess neither of us technically have eyes,” Syl said, leaning back and\nlooking up at the glassy canopy of their tree-mushroom shelter. “We’re each\na bit of power made manifest. We honorspren mimic Honor himself. You\nCryptics mimic … weird stuff?”\n“The fundamental underlying mathematics by which natural phenomena\noccur. Mmm. Truths that explain the fabric of existence.”\n“Yeah. Weird stuff.”\nShallan lowered her pencil, looking with dissatisfaction at the attempt\nshe’d made at drawing a fearspren. It looked like a child’s scribble.\nVeil was seeping out.\nThat has always been you, Shallan. You just have to admit it. Allow it.\n“I’m trying, Wit,” she whispered.\n“You all right?” Adolin asked, kneeling beside her, putting his hand on\nher back, then rubbing her shoulders. Storms, that felt good. They’d walked\nentirely too far these last few days.\nHe glanced at her sketchpad. “More … what did you call it?\nAbstractionalism?”\nShe snapped the sketchpad closed. “What is taking that bridgeman so\nlong?” She glanced over her shoulder, which interrupted Adolin. “Don’t\nstop,” she added, “or I will murder you.”\nHe chuckled and continued working at her shoulders. “He’ll be fine.”\n“You were worried about him yesterday.”\n“He’s got battle fatigue, but an objective will help with that.

She needs a lighter shade. The breastplate is overly much,\nlike she’s trying to prove something. I do like the cape though. I’ve always\nwanted to justify wearing one.

What happened to the fancy suit you got in Kholinar?”\nHe looked down—which stopped the massaging of shoulders for an\nunacceptable count of three, so she growled at him.\n“It didn’t fit me anymore,” he said, resuming the massage. “But you do\nraise an important problem. Yes, we need to find food and drink. But if I\nhave to wear the same uniform this entire trip, you won’t have to murder\nme. I’ll commit suicide.”\nShallan had almost forgotten that she was hungry. How odd.

Bone-white and brown, it had wings extending to the sides and long\ntresses for a tail. In front of its body hovered a cube.\n“Looks like those gloryspren we saw earlier,” she noted. “Only the\nwrong color. And the shape of the head is…”\n“Corrupted!” Syl said. “That’s one of Odium’s!”\n* * *\nAs he stepped inside the lighthouse, Kaladin’s instincts drove him to check\nto either side of the doorway for anyone waiting in ambush. The room\nseemed empty save for furniture, the Shin man, and some strange pictures\non the walls. The place smelled of incense and spices.\nThe Shin man snapped his book closed. “Cutting it close, aren’t you?\nWell, let us begin! We haven’t much time.” He stood up, proving himself to\nbe rather short. His odd clothing had puffed out portions on the arms, the\ntrousers very tight. He walked to a door at the side of the chamber.\n“I should fetch my companions,” Kaladin said.\n“Ah, but the very best readings happen at the beginning of the\nhighstorm!” The man checked a small device that he took from his pocket.\n“Only two minutes off.”\nA highstorm?

Another\nwas a cityscape at dusk, with a group of low houses clustered before an\nenormous wall that had light glowing beyond it.\n“Well, let’s begin!” the man said. “You have come to witness the\nextraordinary, and I shall provide it.

You shall be greatly rewarded in kind—both in dreams and\nluster!”\n“I should really get my friends.…” Kaladin said.\nThe man whipped the cloth off the table, revealing a large crystalline\nglobe. It glowed with a powerful light, bathing the room in luminescence.\nKaladin blinked against it. Was that Stormlight?\n“Are you balking at the price?” the man said. “What is the money to\nyou?

I\nhave no idea what you’re talking about.”\nThe Shin man frowned, face lit from below like the globe. “You came\nhere for a fortune, didn’t you? To the Rii Oracle? You wish me to see the\nunwalked paths—during the highstorm, when realms blend.”\n“A fortune? You mean foretelling the future?” Kaladin felt a bitter taste\nin his mouth. “The future is forbidden.”\nThe old man cocked his head. “But … isn’t this why you came to see\nme?”\n“Storms, no. I’m looking for passage. We heard that ships come by\nhere.”\nThe old man rubbed the bridge of his nose and sighed. “Passage? Why\ndidn’t you say so? And I was really enjoying the speech. Ah well. A ship?\nLet me check my calendars. I think supplies are coming soon.…”\nHe bustled past Kaladin, muttering to himself.\nOutside, the sky rippled with light. The clouds shimmered, gaining a\nstrange, ethereal luminescence. Kaladin gaped, then glanced back at the\nlittle man, who had fetched a ledger from a side table.\n“That…” Kaladin said. “Is that what a highstorm looks like on this\nside?”\n“Hmmm? Oh, new, are you? How have you gotten into Shadesmar, but\nnot seen a storm pass? Did you come directly from the perpendicularity?”\nThe old man frowned. “Not a lot of people coming through there anymore.”\nThat light. The bright sphere on the table—as large as a man’s head, and\nglowing with a milky light—shifted colors, matching the pearlescent ripples\nabove. There was no gemstone inside that globe. And the light seemed\ndifferent. Transfixing.\n“Here now,” the man said as Kaladin stepped forward, “don’t touch that.\nIt’s only for properly trained fo—”\nKaladin rested his hand on the sphere.\nAnd felt himself get carried away by the storm.\n* * *"

The strange spren\nflitted right under their small canopy.\nOverhead, the clouds started to ripple with a vibrant set of colors.\nThe corrupted gloryspren landed on Shallan’s arm. Odium suspects that\nyou survived, a voice said in her mind. That … that was the voice of the\nUnmade from the mirror. Sja-anat. He thinks something strange happened\nto the Oathgate because of our influence—we’ve never managed to\nEnlighten such powerful spren before. It’s believable that something odd\nmight happen. I lied, and said I think you were sent far, far from the point of\ntransfer.\nHe has minions in this realm, and they will be told to hunt you. So take\ncare. Fortunately, he doesn’t know that you’re a Lightweaver—he thinks\nyou are an Elsecaller for some reason.\nI will do what I can, but I’m not sure he trusts me any longer.\nThe spren fluttered away.\n“Wait!” Shallan said. “Wait, I have questions!”\nSyl tried to snatch it, but it dodged and was soon out over the ocean.\n* * *\nKaladin rode the storm.\nHe’d done this before, in dreams. He’d even spoken to the Stormfather.\nThis felt different. He rode in a shimmering, rippling surge of colors.\nAround him, the clouds streamed past at incredible speed, coming alight\nwith those colors. Pulsing with them, as if to a beat.\nHe couldn’t feel the Stormfather. He couldn’t see a landscape beneath\nhim. Just shimmering colors, and clouds that faded into … light.\nThen a figure. Dalinar Kholin, kneeling someplace dark, surrounded by\nnine shadows. A flash of glowing red eyes.\nThe enemy’s champion was coming. Kaladin knew in that moment—an\noverpowering sensation thrumming through him—that Dalinar was in\nterrible, terrible danger. Without help, the Blackthorn was doomed.\n“Where!” Kaladin screamed to the light as it began to fade. “When! How\ndo I reach him!”\nThe colors diminished.\n“Please!”\nHe saw a flash of a vaguely familiar city. Tall, built along the stones, it\nhad a distinctive pattern of buildings at the center. A wall and an ocean\nbeyond.\nKaladin dropped to his knees in the fortuneteller’s room. The little Shin\nman batted Kaladin’s hand from the glowing sphere. “—rtune seers like\nmyself. You’ll ruin it, or…” He trailed off, then took Kaladin’s head,\nturning it toward him. “You saw something!”\nKaladin nodded weakly.\n“How? Impossible. Unless … you’re Invested. What Heightening are\nyou?” He squinted at Kaladin. “No. Something else. Merciful Domi … A\nSurgebinder? It has begun again?”\nKaladin stumbled to his feet. He glanced at the large globe of light,\nwhich the lighthouse keeper covered up again with the black cloth, then put\nhis hand to his forehead, which had begun thumping with pain. What had\nthat been? His heart still raced with anxiety."

His heart still raced with anxiety.\n“I … I need to go get my friends,” he said.\n* * *\nKaladin sat in the main room of the lighthouse, in the chair Riino—the Shin\nlighthouse keeper—had occupied earlier. Shallan and Adolin negotiated\nwith him on the other side of the room, Pattern looming over Shallan’s\nshoulder and making the fortuneteller nervous. Riino had food and supplies\nfor trade, though it would cost them infused spheres. Apparently, Stormlight\nwas the only commodity that mattered on this side.\n“Charlatans like him aren’t uncommon, where I come from,” Azure said,\nresting with her back against the wall near Kaladin. “People who claim to\nbe able to see the future, living off people’s hopes. Your society was right to\nforbid them. The spren do likewise, so his kind have to live off in places\nlike this, hoping people will be desperate enough to come to them. Probably\ngets some business with each ship that comes through.”\n“I saw something, Azure,” Kaladin said, still trembling. “It was real.”\nHis limbs felt drained, like the aftereffect of lifting weights for a long\nperiod.\n“Maybe,” Azure said. “Those types use dusts and powders that grant\neuphoria, making you think you’ve seen something. Even the gods of my\nland catch only glimpses of the Spiritual Realm—and in all my life, I’ve\nonly met one human I believe truly understood it. And he might actually be\na god. I’m not sure.”\n“Wit,” Kaladin said. “The man that brought you the metal that protected\nyour Soulcaster.”\nShe nodded.\nWell, Kaladin had seen something. Dalinar …\nAdolin walked over and handed Kaladin a squat metal cylinder. He used\na device—provided by the Shin man—to break open the top. There were\nsome fish rations inside. Kaladin poked at the chunks with his finger, then\ninspected the container.\n“Canned food,” Azure noted. “It’s extremely convenient.”\nKaladin’s stomach rumbled, so he dug into the fish with the spoon\nAdolin provided. The meat tasted salty, but was good—far better than\nsomething Soulcast. Shallan joined them, trailed by Pattern, while the\nlighthouse keeper bustled off to fetch some supplies they’d traded for. The\nman glanced at the doorway, where the spren of Adolin’s Blade stood, silent\nlike a statue.\nOut through the room’s window, Kaladin could see Syl standing on the\ncoast, watching out over the sea of beads. Her hair doesn’t ripple here, he\nthought. In the Physical Realm it often waved as if being brushed by an\nunseen breeze. Here, it acted like the hair of a human.\nShe hadn’t wanted to enter the lighthouse for some reason. What was\nthat about?\n“The lighthouse keeper says a ship will be arriving any time now,”\nAdolin said. “We should be able to buy passage.”\n“Mmm,” Pattern said. “The ship is going to Celebrant. Mmm. A city on\nthe island.”\n“Island?”"

A city on\nthe island.”\n“Island?”\n“It’s a lake on our side,” Adolin said. “Called the Sea of Spears, in the\nsoutheast of Alethkar. By the ruins … of Rathalas.” He drew his lips to a\nline and glanced away.\n“What?” Kaladin asked.\n“Rathalas was where my mother was killed,” Adolin said. “Assassinated\nby rebels. Her death drove my father into a fury. We almost lost him to the\ndespair.” He shook his head, and Shallan rested her hand on his arm.\n“It’s … not a pleasant event to think about. Sadeas burned the city to the\nground in retribution. My father gets a strange, distant expression whenever\nsomeone mentions Rathalas. I think he blames himself for not stopping\nSadeas, even though he was mad with grief at the time, wounded and\nincoherent from an attempt on his own life.”\n“Well, there’s still a spren city on this side,” Azure said. “But it’s in the\nwrong direction. We need to be heading west—toward the Horneater Peaks\n—not south.”\n“Mmm,” Pattern said. “Celebrant is a prominent city. In it, we could find\npassage wherever we wish to go. And the lighthouse keeper doesn’t know\nwhen a ship going the right way might pass here.”\nKaladin put his fish down, then gestured at Shallan. “Can I have some\npaper?”\nShe let him have a sheet from her sketchpad. With an unpracticed hand,\nhe drew out the buildings he’d seen in his momentary … whatever it had\nbeen. I’ve seen this pattern before. From above.\n“That’s Thaylen City,” Shallan said. “Isn’t it?”\nThat’s right, Kaladin thought. He’d only visited once, opening the city’s\nOathgate. “I saw this, in the vision I explained to you.” He glanced at\nAzure, who seemed skeptical.\nKaladin could still feel his emotion from the vision, that thrumming\nsense of anxiety. The sure knowledge that Dalinar was in grave danger.\nNine shadows. A champion who would lead the enemy forces …\n“The Oathgate in Thaylen City is open and working,” Kaladin said.\n“Shallan and I saw to that. And since the Oathgate in Kholinar brought us to\nShadesmar, theoretically another—one that isn’t corrupted by the Unmade\n—could get us back.”\n“Assuming I can figure out how to work it on this side,” Shallan said.\n“That’s a pretty daunting assumption.”\n“We should try to reach the perpendicularity in the Peaks,” Azure said.\n“It’s the only sure way back.”\n“The lighthouse keeper says he thinks something strange is happening\nthere,” Shallan said. “Ships from that direction have never ended up\narriving.”\nKaladin rested his fingers on the sketch he’d done. He needed to get to\nThaylen City. It didn’t matter how. The darkness inside him seemed to\nretreat.\nHe had a purpose. A goal. Something to focus on other than the people\nhe’d lost in Kholinar.\nProtect Dalinar."

Something to focus on other than the people\nhe’d lost in Kholinar.\nProtect Dalinar.\nKaladin returned to eating his fish, and the group settled in to wait for\nthe ship. It took a few hours, during which the clouds steadily faded in\ncolor, before growing plain white again. On the other side, the highstorm\nhad completed its passing.\nEventually, Kaladin saw something out on the horizon, beyond where\nSyl sat on the rocks. Yes, that was a ship, sailing in from the west.\nExcept … it didn’t have a sail. Had he even felt wind in Shadesmar? He\ndidn’t think so.\nThe ship crashed through the ocean of beads, surging toward the\nlighthouse. It employed no sail, no mast, and no oars. Instead, it was pulled\nfrom the front by an elaborate rigging attached to a group of incredible\nspren. Long and sinuous, they had triangular heads and floated on multiple\nsets of rippling wings.\nStorms … they pulled the ship like chulls. Flying, majestic chulls with\nundulating bodies. He’d never seen anything like it.\nAdolin grunted from where he stood by the window. “Well, at least we’ll\nbe traveling in style.”\n98. Loopholes\nLore suggested leaving a city if the spren there start acting strangely.\nCuriously, Sja-anat was often regarded as an individual, when others\n—like Moelach or Ashertmarn—were seen as forces.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 90\nSzeth of Shinovar left the Skybreaker fortress with the twenty other squires.\nThe sun approached the clouded horizon to the west, gilding the Purelake\nred and gold. Those calm waters, strangely, now sprouted dozens of long\nwooden poles.\nOf various heights ranging from five to thirty feet, these poles appeared\nto have been jammed into fissures in the lake bottom. Each had an odd\nknobby shape at the top.\n“This is a test of martial competence,” Master Warren said. The Azish\nman looked strange in the garb of a Marabethian lawkeeper, chest bare and\nshoulders draped with the short, patterned cloak. The Azish were normally\nso proper, overly encumbered with robes and hats. “We must train to fight,\nif the Desolation truly has begun.”\nWithout Nin’s guidance to confirm, they spoke of the Desolation in “if”s\nand “might”s.\n“Each pole is topped with a group of bags bearing powders of a different\ncolor,” Warren continued. “Fight by throwing those—you cannot use other\nweapons, and you cannot leave the contest area marked by the poles.\n“I will call time over when the sun sets. We will tally the number of\ntimes each squire’s uniform was marked by one of the bags of powder. You\nlose four points for each different color on your uniform, and an additional\npoint for each repeated hit from a color. The winner is the one who has lost\nthe fewest points. Begin.”\nSzeth drew in Stormlight and Lashed himself into the air with the others.\nThough he didn’t care if he won arbitrary tests of competence, the chance to\ndance the Lashings—for once without needing to cause death and\ndestruction—called to him. This would be like those days in his youth,"

This would be like those days in his youth,\nspent training with the Honorblades.\nHe soared upward about thirty feet, then used a half Lashing to hover.\nYes, the tops of the poles each bore a collection of small pouches tied on by\nstrings. He Lashed himself past one, snatching a pouch, which let out a puff\nof pink dust as it came off in his hand. He now saw why the squires had\nbeen told to wear a white shirt and trousers today.\n“Excellent,” Szeth said as the other squires scattered, grabbing pouches.\nWhat? the sword asked. Szeth carried it on his back, tied securely in\nplace, at an angle from which he could not draw the weapon. I don’t\nunderstand. Where is the evil?\n“No evil today, sword-nimi. Just a challenge.”\nHe hurled the pouch at one of the other squires, hitting her square in the\nshoulder, and the resulting dust colored her shirt in that spot. Notably, the\nmaster had said that only color on the uniform would be counted, so holding\nthe pouches and dusting one’s own fingers was fine. Similarly, hitting each\nother in the face gained no advantage.\nThe others took quickly to the game; soon pouches were being flung in\nall directions. Each pole bore only a single color, encouraging competitors\nto move about to hit others with as many colors as possible. Joret tried\nhovering in one spot anyway, dominating one pole to prevent others from\nhitting him with its color. Sitting still made him a target, however, and his\nuniform was quickly covered in spots.\nSzeth dove, then pulled himself up with an expert Lashing so that he\nswooped, skimming the surface of the Purelake. He grabbed a pole as he\npassed, bending it out of Cali’s reach as she went by above.\nI’m down too low, Szeth realized as bags of dust fell toward him. Too\neasy a target.\nHe twisted back and forth, executing a complex maneuver that\nmanipulated both Lashings and the wind of his passing. Pouches smacked\nthe water near him.\nHe pulled upward. Lashing wasn’t like the flight of a swallow—instead,\nit was like tying oneself to strings, a puppet to be yanked about. It was easy\nto lose control, as evidenced by the awkward motions of the newer squires.\nAs Szeth gained height, Zedzil fell in behind him, holding a pouch in\neach hand. Szeth added a second Lashing upward, then a third. His\nStormlight lasted so much longer than it had before—he could only assume\nthat Radiants were more efficient than those who used Honorblades for the\npowers.\nHe shot upward like an arrow, windspren joining and twisting around\nhim. Zedzil followed, but when he tried to throw a pouch at Szeth, the wind\nwas too great. The pouch fell backward immediately, striking Zedzil on his\nown shoulder.\nSzeth dropped into a dive, and Zedzil followed until Szeth snatched a\ngreen bag from a pole and tossed it over his shoulder, hitting Zedzil again.\nThe younger man cursed, then shot away to find easier prey."

Szeth had rarely\nfought in the air itself, and this contest felt similar to when he’d battled the\nWindrunner in the skies. He twisted among the poles, dodging pouches—\neven snatching one from the air before it hit him—and found he was\nenjoying himself.\nThe screams from the shadows seemed dim, less pressing. He wove\nbetween thrown pouches, dancing above a lake painted by the hues of a\nsetting sun, and smiled.\nThen immediately felt guilty. He had left tears, blood, and terror in his\nwake like a personal seal. He had destroyed monarchies, families—innocent\nand guilty alike. He could not be happy. He was only a tool of retribution.\nNot redemption, for he dared not believe in such.\nIf he was to be forced to keep living, it should not be a life that anyone\nwould ever envy.\nYou think like Vasher, the sword said in his head. Do you know Vasher?\nHe teaches swords to people now, which is funny because VaraTreledees\nalways says Vasher isn’t any good with the sword.\nSzeth rededicated himself to the fight, not for joy but for practicality.\nUnfortunately, his momentary distraction earned him his first hit. A dark\nblue pouch struck, its circle stark on his white shirt.\nHe growled, soaring upward with a pouch in each hand. He flung them\nwith precision, hitting one squire in the back, then another in the leg.\nNearby, four of the older squires flew in formation. They would chase an\nisolated squire, swarming him or her with a flurry of eight pouches, often\nscoring six or seven hits while rarely getting hit themselves.\nAs Szeth zoomed past, they fixated on him, perhaps because his uniform\nwas nearly pristine. He immediately Lashed himself upward—canceling his\nlateral Lashing—to try to get above the pack. These were well practiced\nwith their powers, however, and not so easily put off.\nIf he continued straight upward, they’d merely chase him until he ran out\nof Stormlight. Already his reserves were low, as each squire had only been\ngiven enough to last through the contest. If he double- or triple-Lashed\nhimself too often, he’d run out early.\nThe sun was slipping inch by inch out of sight. Not much time left; he\nsimply needed to last.\nSzeth dove to the side, moving quickly and erratically. Only one of the\npack chasing him chanced a throw; the others knew to wait for a better shot.\nSzeth’s swoop took him straight toward a pole, but it held no pouches. Fari\nlooked like he had gathered them all up to hoard the color.\nSo Szeth grabbed the pole itself.\nHe pushed it to the side, bending it until it snapped, leaving him with a\npole some ten feet long. He lightened it with a partial Lashing upward, then\ntucked it under his arm.\nA quick glance over the shoulder showed that the four teammates were\nstill tailing him. The one who had thrown earlier had grabbed two new\npouches and was catching up to the others with a double Lashing."

The one who had thrown earlier had grabbed two new\npouches and was catching up to the others with a double Lashing.\nMake a stand, the sword suggested. You can take them.\nFor once, Szeth agreed. He zoomed down until he was near the water, his\npassing causing a trail of ripples on the surface. Younger squires dodged out\nof his way, flinging dust bags, but missing because of his speed.\nHe deliberately Lashed himself to the side in a smooth, predictable turn.\nIt was exactly the opportunity the pack had been waiting for, and they\nstarted throwing at him. But he was no frightened child, to be intimidated\nand overwhelmed by superior numbers. He was the Assassin in White. And\nthis was but a game.\nSzeth spun and began batting the pouches away with his staff. He even\nmanaged to hit the last one back into the face of the leader of the group, a\nman named Ty.\nIt wouldn’t count as a mark, but the dust got in Ty’s eyes, causing him to\nblink and slow. The group expended most of their pouches, which let Szeth\n—Lashed now directly toward them—get close.\nAnd nobody should ever let him get too close.\nHe dropped his staff and grabbed a squire by her shirt, using her as a\nshield from an opportunist outside the group, who was throwing crimson\nbags. Szeth spun with her, then kicked her toward a companion. They\nslammed together, trailing streaks of red dust. He grabbed another squire\nfrom the pack, trying to Lash him away.\nThe man’s body resisted the Lashing, however. People bearing\nStormlight were more difficult to Lash—something Szeth was only now\ncoming to understand. He could, however, Lash himself backward, hauling\nthe man with him. When he let go, the squire had trouble adjusting to the\nchange in momentum, and jolted in the air, letting himself get hit by a half\ndozen bags from outsiders.\nSzeth zipped away, running dangerously low on Stormlight. Only\nanother few minutes …\nBeneath him, Ty called to the others, pointing up at Szeth. The obvious\ncurrent winner. Only one strategy made sense at this point.\n“Get him!” Ty shouted.\nOh, good! the sword said.\nSzeth Lashed himself downward—which proved wise, as many of the\nsquires shot up past him, assuming he’d try to stay high. No, his best\ndefense while outnumbered was confusion. He got among them, a storm of\npouches targeting him. Szeth did what he could to avoid them, zipping one\nway, then the other—but there were too many attacks. The poorly aimed\nones were the most dangerous, as moving out of the way of a well-placed\nattack almost always took him into the path of an errant one.\nOne pouch struck his back, followed by a second. A third hit his side.\nDust flew all around as the squires hit each other too. That was his hope:\nthat even as he took hits, they would take more.\nHe soared up, then dove again, causing the others to dodge like sparrows\nbefore a hawk. He flew along the water, scattering fish in the waning light,\nthen shot upward to—\nHis Stormlight ran out."

He dropped through the cloud of multicolored dust,\nleaving an afterimage from his loosely fastened spirit.\nHe splashed into the Purelake.\nFortunately, he hadn’t been too high, so the landing was only mildly\npainful. He hit the bottom of the shallow lake; then when he stood up, the\nothers hit him with another round of pouches.

I…”\nWhat were those two spren floating nearby, shaped as small slits in the\nair? They separated the sky, like wounds in skin, exposing a black field full\nof stars. When they moved, the substance of reality bent around them.\nSzeth bowed his head. He no longer ascribed to spren any particular\nreligious significance, but he could still be in awe of these. He might have\nlost this contest, but he seemed to have impressed the highspren.\nOr had he lost? What exactly had the rules been?\nThoughtful, he ducked under the water, swimming in the shallow lake\nback toward the bank. He climbed out, water streaming from his clothing as\nhe walked up to the others. The masters had brought out bright sphere\nlanterns, along with food and refreshment. A Tashikki squire was recording\nthe points while two masters adjudicated what counted as a “hit” and what\ndid not.\nSzeth suddenly felt frustrated by their games. Nin had promised him the\nopportunity to cleanse Shinovar. What time was there for games? The\nmoment had come for him to ascend to a rank beyond all of this.\nHe walked up to the masters. “I am sorry to have won this contest, as I\ndid the one with the prison.”\n“You?” Ty said, incredulous. Ty had five spots on him. Not bad. “You\ngot hit at least two dozen times.”\n“I believe,” Szeth replied, “that the rules stated the winner was the one\nwith the fewest marks on his uniform.” He held his hands to the side,\nshowing his white clothing, washed clean during his swim.\nWarren and Ki shared a look. She nodded with a hint of a smile.\n“There is always one,” Warren said, “who notices that. Remember that\nwhile loopholes are to be exploited, Szeth-son-Neturo, they are dangerous\nto rely upon. Still, you have done well. Both in your performance, and in\nseeing this hole in the rules.” He glanced into the night, squinting at the two\nhighspren, who seemed to have made themselves visible to Warren as well.\n“Others agree.”\n“He used a weapon,” one of the older squires said, pointing. “He broke\nthe rules!”"

He had slept fitfully, slumber\ninterrupted by thoughts of his men dying, of Elhokar and Moash, of worries\nfor Drehy and Skar. The darkness blanketed his feelings, making him\nlethargic. He hated that he was the last to rise. That was always a bad sign.\nHe used the facilities, then forced himself to climb up the steps. The\nvessel had three levels. The bottom was the hold. The next level, the lower\ndeck, was for the cabins, where the humans had been given a spot for them\nall to share.\nThe uppermost deck was open to the sky, and was populated by spren."

They\nlooked like humans with strange bronze skin—metallic, as if they were\nliving statues. Both men and women wore rugged jackets and trousers.\nActual human clothing, not merely imitations of it like Syl wore.\nThey didn’t carry weapons other than knives, but the ship had wicked\nharpoons clipped in racks at the sides of the deck. Seeing those made\nKaladin infinitely more comfortable; he knew exactly where to go for a\nweapon.\nSyl stood near the bow, watching out over the sea of beads again. He\nalmost missed spotting her at first because her dress was red, instead of its\nnormal white-blue. Her hair had changed to black, and … and her skin was\nflesh colored—tan, like Kaladin’s. What on Roshar?\nHe crossed the deck toward her, stumbling as the ship crashed through a\nswell in the beads. Storms, and Shallan said this was more smooth than\nsome boats she’d been on? Several Reachers passed, calmly managing the\nlarge riggings and harnesses that attached to the spren who pulled the craft.\n“Ah, human,” one of the Reachers said as Kaladin passed. That was the\ncaptain, wasn’t it? Captain Ico? He resembled a Shin man, with large,\nchildlike eyes made of metal. He was shorter than the Alethi, but sturdy. He\nwore the same tan clothing as the others, sporting a multitude of buttoned\npockets.\n“Come with me,” Ico told Kaladin, then crossed the deck without\nwaiting for a response. They didn’t speak much, these Reachers.\nKaladin sighed, then followed the captain back to the stairwell. A line of\ncopper plating ran down the inside wall of the stairwell—and Kaladin had\nseen a similar ornamentation on the deck. He’d assumed it was decorative,\nbut as the captain walked, he rested his fingers on the metal in an odd way.\nTouching a plate with the tips of his fingers, Kaladin felt a distinct\nvibration. They passed the quarters of the ordinary spren sailors. They\ndidn’t sleep, but they did seem to enjoy their breaks from work, swinging\nquietly in hammocks, often reading.\nIt didn’t bother him to see male Reachers with books—spren were\nobviously similar to ardents, who were outside of common understandings\nof male and female. At the same time … spren, reading? How odd.\nWhen they reached the hold, the captain turned on a small oil lamp—so\nfar as Kaladin could tell, he didn’t use a flaming brand to create the fire.\nHow did it work? It seemed foolhardy to use fire for light with so much\nwood and cloth around.\n“Why not use spheres for light?” Kaladin asked him.\n“We have none,” Ico said. “Stormlight fades too quickly on this side.”\nThat was true. Kaladin’s team carried several larger unset gemstones,\nwhich would hold Stormlight for weeks—but the smaller spheres would run\nout after a week or so without seeing a storm.

        "text": "That was true. Kaladin’s team carried several larger unset gemstones,\nwhich would hold Stormlight for weeks—but the smaller spheres would run\nout after a week or so without seeing a storm. They’d been able to trade the\nchips and marks to the lighthouse keeper in exchange for barter supplies—\nmostly cloth—to buy passage on this ship.\n“The lighthouse keeper wanted the Stormlight,” Kaladin said. “He kept it\nin some kind of globe.”\nCaptain Ico grunted. “Foreign technology,” he said. “Dangerous. Draws\nthe wrong spren.” He shook his head. “At Celebrant, the moneychangers\nhave perfect gemstones that can hold the light indefinitely. Similar.”\n“Perfect gemstones? Like, the Stone of Ten Dawns?”\n“I don’t know of this thing. Light in a perfect stone doesn’t run out, so\nyou can give Stormlight to the moneychangers. They use devices to transfer\nit from smaller gemstones to their perfect ones. Then they give you credit to\nspend in the city.”\nThe hold was closely packed with barrels and boxes that were lashed to\nthe walls and floor. Kaladin could barely squeeze through. Ico selected a\nrope-handled box from a stack, then asked Kaladin to pull it out as Ico\nresettled the boxes that had been atop it, then relashed them.\nKaladin spent the time thinking about perfect gemstones. Did such a\nthing exist on his side? If there really were flawless stones that could hold\nStormlight without ever running out, that seemed important to know. It\ncould mean the difference between life and death for Radiants during the\nWeeping.\nOnce Ico was done resettling the cargo, he gestured for Kaladin to help\nhim pick up the box they’d removed. They maneuvered it out of the hold\nand up onto the top deck. Here, the captain knelt and opened the box, which\nrevealed a strange device that looked a little like a coatrack—although only\nabout three feet tall. Made entirely of steel, it had dozens of small metal\nprongs extending from it, like the branches of a tree—only it had a metal\nbasin at the very bottom.\nIco fished in a pocket and took out a small box, from which he removed\na handful of glass beads like those that made up the ocean. He placed one of\nthem into a hole in the center of the device, then waved toward Kaladin.\n“Stormlight.”\n“For what?”\n“For you to live.”\n“Are you threatening me, Captain?”\nIco sighed and regarded him with a suffering expression. Very human in\nits nature. It seemed the look of a man talking to a child. The spren captain\nwaved his hand, insistent, so Kaladin took a diamond mark from his pocket.\nCradling the sphere in one hand, Ico touched the glass bead he’d put in\nthe fabrial. “This is a soul,” he said. “Soul of water, but very cold.”\n“Ice?”\n“Ice from a high, high place,” he said. “Ice that has never melted. Ice\nthat has never known warmth.” The light in Kaladin’s sphere dimmed as Ico\nconcentrated. “You know how to manifest souls?”\n“No,” Kaladin said.\n“Some of your kind do,” he said. “It is rare. Rare among us too. The"

The\ngardeners among the cultivationspren are best at it. I am unpracticed.”\nThe ocean bead expanded and grew cloudy, looking like ice. Kaladin got\na distinct sense of coldness from it.\nIco handed back the diamond mark, now partially drained, then dusted\noff his hands and stood up, pleased.\n“What does it do?” Kaladin asked.\nIco nudged the device with his foot. “It gets cold now.”\n“Why?”\n“Cold makes water,” he said. “Water collects in that basin. You drink,\nand don’t die.”\nCold makes water? It didn’t seem to be making any water that Kaladin\ncould see. Ico hiked off to survey the spren steering the ship, so Kaladin\nknelt beside the device, trying to understand. Eventually, he spotted drops\nof water collecting on the “branches” of the device. They ran down the\nmetal and gathered in the basin.\nHuh. When the captain had said—during their initial negotiations—that\nhe could provide water for human passengers, Kaladin had assumed the\nship would have some barrels in the hold.\nThe device took about a half hour to make a small cup of water, which\nKaladin drank as a test—the basin had a spigot and a detachable tin cup.\nThe water was cool but flavorless, unlike rainwater. How did coldness make\nwater though? Was this melting ice in the Physical Realm somehow, and\nbringing it here?\nAs he was sipping the water, Syl walked over—her skin, hair, and dress\nstill colored like those of a human. She stopped next to him, placed her\nhands on her hips, and went into full pout.\n“What?” Kaladin asked.\n“They won’t let me ride one of the flying spren.”\n“Smart.”\n“Insufferable.”\n“Why on Roshar would you look at one of those things and think, ‘You\nknow what, I need to get on its back’?”\nSyl looked at him as if he were crazy. “Because they can fly.”\n“So can you. Actually, so can I.”\n“You don’t fly, you fall the wrong way.” She unfolded her arms so that\nshe could fold them immediately again and huff loudly. “You’re telling me\nyou’re not even curious what it’s like to climb on one of those things?”\n“Horses are bad enough. I’m not about to get onto something that\ndoesn’t even have legs.”\n“Where’s your sense of adventure?”\n“I dragged it out back and clubbed it senseless for getting me into the\narmy. What have you done to your skin and hair, by the way?”\n“It’s a Lightweaving,” she said. “I asked Shallan, because I didn’t want\nrumors of an honorspren spreading from the ship’s crew.”\n“We can’t waste Stormlight on something like that, Syl.”\n“We used a mark that was running out anyway!” she said. “So it was\nworthless to us; it would have been depleted by the time we arrived. So it’s\nwasting nothing.”\n“What if there’s an emergency?”"

So it’s\nwasting nothing.”\n“What if there’s an emergency?”\nShe stuck her tongue out at him, then at the sailors at the front of the\nship. Kaladin returned the little tin cup to its place on the side of the device,\nthen settled with his back to the ship railing. Shallan sat across the deck\nnear the flying spren, doing sketches.\n“You should go talk to her,” Syl said, sitting next to him.\n“About wasting Stormlight?” Kaladin said. “Yes, perhaps I should. She\ndoes seem inclined to be frivolous with who she expends it for.”\nSyl rolled her eyes.\n“What?”\n“Don’t go lecture her, silly. Chat with her. About life. About fun things.”\nSyl nudged him with her foot. “I know you want to. I can feel that you do.\nBe glad I’m the wrong kind of spren, or I would probably be licking your\nforehead or something to get at your emotions.”\nThe ship surged against a wave of beads. The souls of things in the\nphysical world.\n“Shallan is betrothed to Adolin,” Kaladin said.\n“Which isn’t an oath,” Syl said. “It’s a promise to maybe make an oath\nsometime.”\n“It’s still not the sort of thing you play around with.”\nSyl rested her hand on his knee. “Kaladin. I’m your spren. It’s my duty\nto make sure that you’re not alone.”\n“Is that so? Who decided?”\n“I did. And don’t give me excuses about not being lonely, or about ‘only\nneeding your brothers in arms.’ You can’t lie to me. You feel dark, sad. You\nneed something, someone, and she makes you feel better.”\nStorms. It felt like Syl and his emotions were double-teaming him. One\nsmiled with encouragement, while the other whispered terrible things. That\nhe’d always be alone. That Tarah had been right to leave him.\nHe filled another cup with as much water as he could get from the basin,\nthen carried it toward Shallan. The pitching of the ship almost made him\ndump the cup overboard.\nShallan glanced up as he eased down beside her, his back resting against\nthe deck’s railing. He handed her the cup. “It makes water,” he said,\nthumbing at the device. “By getting cold.”\n“Condensation? How fast does it go? Navani would be interested in\nthat.” She sipped the water, holding it in her gloved safehand—which was\nstrange to see on her. Even when they’d traveled the bottoms of the chasms\ntogether, she’d worn a very formal havah.\n“You walk like they do,” she said absently, finishing her sketch of one of\nthe flying beasts.\n“They?”\n“The sailors. You keep your balance well. You’d have been at home as a\nsailor yourself, I suspect. Unlike some others.” She nodded toward Azure,\nwho stood across the deck, holding on to the railing for dear life and\noccasionally shooting distrusting glares at the Reachers. Either she did not\nlike being on a ship, or she did not trust the spren. Perhaps both.\n“May I?” Kaladin asked, nodding toward Shallan’s sketch. She"

She\nshrugged, so he took the sketchpad and studied her pictures of the flying\nbeasts. As always, they were excellent. “What does the text say?”\n“Just some theorizing,” she said, flipping back a page in her notebook. “I\nlost my original of this picture, so this is kind of crude. But have you ever\nseen something like these arrowhead spren here?”\n“Yeah…” Kaladin said, studying her drawing of a skyeel flying with\narrowhead spren moving around it. “I’ve seen them near greatshells.”\n“Chasmfiends, skyeels, anything else that should be heavier than it\nactually is. Sailors call them luckspren on our side.” She gestured with the\ncup toward the front of the ship, where sailors managed the flying beasts.\n“They call these ‘mandras,’ but the arrowhead shapes on their heads are the\nsame shape as luckspren. These are bigger, but I think they—or something\nlike them—help skyeels fly.”\n“Chasmfiends don’t fly.”\n“They kind of do, mathematically. Bavamar did the calculations on\nReshi greatshells, and found they should be crushed by their own weight.”\n“Huh,” Kaladin said.\nShe started to get excited. “There’s more. Those mandras, they vanish\nsometimes. Their keepers call it ‘dropping.’ I think they must be getting\npulled into the Physical Realm. It means you can never use only one\nmandra to pull a ship, no matter how small that ship. And you can’t take\nthem—or most other spren—too far from human population centers on our\nside. They waste away and die for reasons people here don’t understand.”\n“Huh. So what do they eat?”\n“I’m not sure,” Shallan said. “Syl and Pattern talk about feeding off\nemotions, but there’s something else that…” She trailed off as Kaladin\nflipped to the next page in her notebook. It seemed like an attempt at\ndrawing Captain Ico, but was incredibly juvenile. Basically just a stick\nfigure.\n“Did Adolin get hold of your sketchbook?” he asked.\nShe snatched the book from him and closed it. “I was just trying out a\ndifferent style. Thanks for the water.”\n“Yes, I had to walk all the way from over there. At least seven steps.”\n“Easily ten,” Shallan said. “And on this precarious deck. Very\ndangerous.”\n“Practically as bad as fighting the Fused.”\n“Could have stubbed your toe. Or gotten a splinter. Or pitched over the\nside and been lost to the depths, buried by a thousand thousand beads and\nthe weight of the souls of an infinite number of forgotten objects.”\n“Or … that.”\n“Highly unlikely,” Shallan agreed. “They keep this deck well\nmaintained, so there really aren’t any splinters.”\n“With my luck, I’d find one anyway.”\n“I had a splinter once,” Shallan noted. “It eventually got out of hand.”\n“You … you did not just say that.”\n“Yes, you obviously imagined it. What a sick, sick mind you have,\nKaladin.”"

What a sick, sick mind you have,\nKaladin.”\nKaladin sighed, then nodded to the sailors. “They do walk about\nbarefoot. Have you noticed that? Something about the copper lines set into\nthe deck.”\n“The copper vibrates,” Shallan said. “And they keep touching it. I think\nthey might be using it to communicate somehow.”\n“That would explain why they don’t talk much,” Kaladin said. “I’d have\nexpected them to watch us a little more than they do. They don’t seem that\ncurious about us.”\n“Which is odd, considering how interesting Azure is.”\n“Wait. Just Azure?”\n“Yes. In that polished breastplate and striking figure, with her talk of\nchasing bounties and traveling worlds. She’s deeply mysterious.”\n“I’m mysterious,” Kaladin said.\n“I used to think you were. Then I found out you don’t like good puns—\nit’s truly possible to know too much about somebody.”\nHe grunted. “I’ll try to be more mysterious. Take up bounty hunting.”\nHis stomach growled. “Starting with a bounty on lunch, maybe.”\nThey’d been promised two meals a day, but considering how long it had\ntaken Ico to remember they needed water, perhaps he should ask.\n“I’ve been trying to track our speed,” Shallan said, flipping through her\nnotebook. She went quickly through the pages, and he could see that—\noddly—they alternated between expert renditions and comically bad ones.\nShe landed on a map she’d made of this region in Shadesmar. Alethi\nrivers were now peninsulas, and the Sea of Spears was an island, with the\ncity named Celebrant on the western side. The river peninsulas meant that\nin order to get to the city, the ship had to swing to the west. Shallan had\nmarked their path with a line.\n“It’s hard to gauge our progress, but I’d guess that we’re moving faster\nthan the average ship in our world. We can go directly where we want\nwithout worrying about the winds, for one thing.”\n“So … two more days?” Kaladin asked, guessing based on her marks.\n“More or less. Quick progress.”\nHe moved his fingers down, toward the bottom of her map. “Thaylen\nCity?” he asked, tapping one point she’d marked.\n“Yes. On this side, it will be on the edge of a lake of beads. We can guess\nthe Oathgate will reflect there as a platform, like the one we left in Kholinar.\nBut how to activate it…”\n“I want to try. Dalinar is in danger. We need to get to him, Shallan. In\nThaylen City.”\nShe glanced at Azure, who maintained that was the wrong direction to\ngo. “Kaladin … I don’t know if we can trust what you saw. It’s dangerous to\npresume you know the future—”\n“I didn’t see the future,” Kaladin said quickly. “It wasn’t like that. It was\nlike soaring the sky with the Stormfather. I just know … I know I have to\nget to Dalinar.”\nShe still seemed skeptical. Perhaps he’d told them too much of the\nlighthouse keeper’s theatrics.\n“We’ll see, once we get to Celebrant.” Shallan closed her map, then"

Perhaps he’d told them too much of the\nlighthouse keeper’s theatrics.\n“We’ll see, once we get to Celebrant.” Shallan closed her map, then\nsquirmed, glancing back at the railing they’d been leaning against. “Do you\nsuppose they have chairs anywhere? These railings aren’t very comfortable\nfor sitting against.”\n“Probably not.”\n“What do you even call these things?” Shallan said, tapping the railing.\n“A deck wall?”\n“No doubt they’ve made up some obscure nautical word,” Kaladin said.\n“Everything on a ship has odd names. Port and starboard instead of left and\nright. Galley instead of kitchen. Nuisance instead of Shallan.”\n“There was a name … railing? Deck guard? No, wale. It’s called a\nwale.” She grinned. “I don’t really like how it feels to sit against this wale,\nbut I’m sure I’ll eventually get over it.”\nHe groaned softly. “Really?”\n“Vengeance for calling me names.”\n“Name. One name. And it was more a declaration of fact than an attack.”\nShe punched him lightly in the arm. “It’s good to see you smiling.”\n“That was smiling?”\n“It was the Kaladin equivalent. That scowl was almost jovial.” She\nsmiled at him.\nSomething felt warm within him at being near her. Something felt right.\nIt wasn’t like with Laral, his boyhood crush. Or even like with Tarah, his\nfirst real romance. It was something different, and he couldn’t define it. He\nonly knew he didn’t want it to stop. It pushed back the darkness.\n“Down in the chasms,” he said, “when we were trapped together, you\ntalked about your life. About … your father.”\n“I remember,” she said softly. “In the darkness of the storm.”\n“How do you do it, Shallan? How do you keep smiling and laughing?\nHow do you keep from fixating on the terrible things that have happened?”\n“I cover them up. I have this uncanny ability to hide away anything I\ndon’t want to think about. It … it’s getting harder, but for most things I can\njust…” She trailed off, staring straight ahead. “There. Gone.”\n“Wow.”\n“I know,” she whispered. “I’m crazy.”\n“No. No, Shallan! I wish I could do the same.”\nShe looked at him, brow wrinkling. “You’re crazy.”\n“How nice would it be, if I could simply shove it all away? Storms.” He\ntried to imagine it. Not spending his life worrying about the mistakes he’d\nmade. Not hearing the constant whispers that he wasn’t good enough, or\nthat he’d failed his men.\n“This way, I’ll never face it,” Shallan said.\n“It’s better than being unable to function.”\n“That’s what I tell myself.” She shook her head. “Jasnah said that power\nis an illusion of perception. Act like you have authority, and you often will.\nBut pretending fragments me. I’m too good at pretending.”\n“Well, whatever you’re doing, it’s obviously working.

An Old Friend\nI am convinced that Nergaoul is still active on Roshar. The accounts of\nthe Alethi “Thrill” of battle align too well with ancient records—\nincluding the visions of red mist and dying creatures.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 140\nDalinar remembered almost everything now. Though he still hadn’t\nrecovered the details of his meeting with the Nightwatcher, the rest was as\nfresh as a new wound, dripping blood down his face.\nThere had been so many more holes in his mind than he’d realized. The\nNightwatcher had ripped apart his memories like the fabric of an old\nblanket, then sewn a new quilt out of it. In the intervening years he’d\nthought himself mostly whole, but now all those scars had been ripped free\nand he could see the truth.\nHe tried to put all of that out of his mind as he toured Vedenar, one of the\ngreat cities of the world, known for its amazing gardens and lush\natmosphere. Unfortunately, the city had been devastated by the Veden civil\nwar, then the subsequent arrival of the Everstorm. Even along the sanitized\npath he walked for the tour, they passed scorched buildings, piles of rubble.\nHe couldn’t help but think of what he’d done to Rathalas. And so, Evi’s\ntears accompanied him. The cries of dying children.\nHypocrite, they said. Murderer. Destroyer.\nThe air smelled of salt and was filled with the sounds of waves smashing\non cliffs outside the city. How did they live with that constant roaring? Did\nthey never know peace? Dalinar tried to listen politely as Taravangian’s\npeople led him into a garden, full of low walls overgrown with vines and\nshrubs. One of few that hadn’t been destroyed in the civil war.\nThe Vedens loved ostentatious greenery. Not a subtle people, all\nbrimming with passion and vice.\nThe wife of one of the new Veden highprinces eventually led Navani off\nto inspect some paintings. Dalinar was instead led to a small garden square,\nwhere some Veden lighteyes were chatting and drinking wine. A low wall\non the eastern side here allowed for the growth of all kinds of rare plants in\na jumble, which was the current horticultural fashion. Lifespren bobbed\namong them.\nMore small talk? “Excuse me,” Dalinar said, nodding toward a raised\ngazebo. “I’m going to take a moment to survey the city.”\nOne of the lighteyes raised his hand. “I can show—”\n“No thank you,” Dalinar said, then started up the steps to the gazebo.\nPerhaps that had been too abrupt. Well, at least it fit his reputation. His\nguards had the sense to remain below, at the foot of the steps.\nHe reached the top, trying to relax. The gazebo gave him a nice view of\nthe cliffs and the sea beyond. Unfortunately, it let him see the rest of the city\n—and storms, it was not in good shape. The walls were broken in places,\nthe palace nothing more than rubble. Huge swaths of the city had burned,"

Huge swaths of the city had burned,\nincluding many of the platelike terraces that had been Veden showpieces.\nOut beyond—on the fields north of the city—black scars on the rock still\nshowed where heaps of bodies had been burned following the war. He tried\nto turn away from all that and look out at the peaceful ocean. But he could\nsmell smoke. That wasn’t good. In the years following Evi’s death, smoke\nhad often sent him descending into one of his worse days.\nStorms. I’m stronger than this. He could fight it. He wasn’t the man he’d\nbeen all those years ago. He forced his attention toward the stated purpose\nof visiting the city: surveying the Veden martial capabilities.\nMany of the living Veden troops were barracked in storm bunkers right\ninside the city walls. From reports he’d heard earlier, the civil war had\nbrought incredible losses. Even baffling ones. Many armies would break\nafter suffering ten percent casualties, but here—reportedly—the Vedens had\ncontinued fighting after losing more than half their numbers.\nPerhaps they’d been driven mad by the persistent crashing of those\nwaves. And … what else did he hear?\nMore phantom weeping. Taln’s palms! Dalinar drew a deep breath, but\nsmelled only smoke.\nWhy must I have these memories? he thought, angry. Why did they\nsuddenly return?\nMixing with those emotions was a growing fear for Adolin and Elhokar.\nWhy hadn’t they sent word? If they’d escaped, wouldn’t they have flown to\nsafety—or at the very least, found a spanreed? It seemed ridiculous to\nassume multiple Radiants and Shardbearers were trapped in the city, unable\nto flee. But the alternative was to worry that they hadn’t survived. That he’d\nsent them to die.\nDalinar tried to stand, straight-backed and at attention, beneath the\nweight of it all. Unfortunately, he knew too well that if you locked your\nknees and stood too straight, you risked fainting. Why was it that trying to\nstand tall should make you so much more likely to fall?\nHis guards at the base of the stone hill parted to let Taravangian—in his\ncharacteristic orange robes—shuffle through. The old man carried an\nenormous diamond-shaped kite shield, large enough to cover his entire left\nside. He climbed up to the gazebo, then sat down on one of the benches,\npanting.\n“Did you want to see one of these, Dalinar?” he asked after a moment,\nholding out the shield.\nGlad for the distraction, Dalinar took the shield, hefting it. “Half-shard?”\nhe said, noting a steel box—with a gemstone inside—fastened to the inner\nsurface.\n“Indeed,” Taravangian said. “Crude devices. There are legends of metal\nthat can block a Shardblade. A metal that falls from the sky. Silver, but\nsomehow lighter. I should like to see that, but for now we can use these.”\nDalinar grunted.\n“You know how they make fabrials, don’t you?” Taravangian asked.\n“Enslaved spren?”"

We have\nentrapped in that shield something that, at another time, might have blessed\na Knight Radiant.”\nStorms. He couldn’t deal with a philosophical problem like this today.\nHe tried to change the topic. “You seem to be feeling better.”\n“It’s a good day for me. I feel better than I have recently, but that can be\ndangerous. I’m prone to thinking about mistakes I’ve made.” Taravangian\nsmiled in his kindly way. “I try to tell myself that at the very least, I made\nthe best choice I could, with the information I had.”\n“Unfortunately, I’m certain I didn’t make the best choices I could,”\nDalinar said.\n“But you wouldn’t change them. If you did, you’d be a different person.”\nI did change them, Dalinar thought. I erased them. And I did become a\ndifferent person. Dalinar set the shield beside the old man.\n“Tell me, Dalinar,” Taravangian said. “You’ve spoken of your disregard\nfor your ancestor, the Sunmaker. You called him a tyrant.”\nLike me.\n“Let us say,” Taravangian continued, “you could snap your fingers and\nchange history. Would you make it so that the Sunmaker lived longer and\naccomplished his desire, uniting all of Roshar under a single banner?”\n“Turn him into more of a despot?” Dalinar said. “That would have meant\nhim slaughtering his way all across Azir and into Iri. Of course I wouldn’t\nwish that.”\n“But what if it left you, today, in command of a completely unified\npeople? What if his slaughter let you save Roshar from the Voidbringer\ninvasion?”\n“I … You’d be asking me to consign millions of innocents to the pyre!”\n“Those people are long dead,” Taravangian whispered. “What are they to\nyou? Numbers in a scribe’s footnote. Yes, the Sunmaker was a monster.\nHowever, the current trade routes between Herdaz, Jah Keved, and Azir\nwere forged by his tyranny. He brought culture and science back to\nAlethkar. Your modern Alethi cultural eruption can be traced directly back\nto what he did. Morality and law are built upon the bodies of the slain.”\n“I can’t do anything about that.”\n“No, no. Of course you can’t.” Taravangian tapped the half-shard shield.\n“Do you know how we capture spren for fabrials, Dalinar? From spanreeds\nto heatrials, it’s all the same. You lure the spren with something it loves.\nYou give it something familiar to draw it in, something it knows deeply. In\nthat moment, it becomes your slave.”\nI … I really can’t think about this right now. “Excuse me,” Dalinar said,\n“I need to go check on Navani.”"

        "text": "that moment, it becomes your slave.”\nI … I really can’t think about this right now. “Excuse me,” Dalinar said,\n“I need to go check on Navani.”\nHe strode from the gazebo and down the steps, bustling past Rial and his\nother guards. They followed, towed in his wake like leaves after a strong\ngust of wind. He entered the city, but didn’t go looking for Navani. Perhaps\nhe could visit the troops.\nHe walked back along the street, trying to ignore the destruction. Even\nwithout it though, this city felt off to him. The architecture was very like\nAlethi architecture, nothing like the flowery designs of Kharbranth or\nThaylenah—but many buildings had plants draping and dangling from\nevery window. It was strange to walk along streets full of people who\nlooked Alethi but spoke a foreign tongue.\nEventually Dalinar reached the large stormshelters right inside the city\nwalls. Soldiers had set up tent cities next to them, temporary bivouacs they\ncould tear down and carry into one of the loaflike bunkers for storms.\nDalinar found himself growing calmer as he walked among them. This was\nfamiliar; this was the peace of soldiers at work.\nThe officers here welcomed him, and generals took him on tours of the\nbunkers. They were impressed by his ability to speak their language—\nsomething he’d gained early in his visit to the city, using his Bondsmith\nabilities.\nAll Dalinar did was nod and ask the occasional question, but somehow\nhe felt like he was accomplishing something. At the end, he entered a\nbreezy tent near the city gates, where he met with a group of wounded\nsoldiers. Each had survived when his entire platoon had fallen. Heroes, but\nnot the conventional type. It took being a soldier to understand the heroism\nof simply being willing to continue after all your friends had died.\nThe last in line was an elderly veteran who wore a clean uniform and a\npatch for a defunct platoon. His right arm was missing, his jacket sleeve\ntied off, and a younger soldier led him up to Dalinar. “Look, Geved. The\nBlackthorn himself! Didn’t you always say you wanted to meet him?”\nThe older man had one of those stares that made him seem like he could\nsee right through you. “Brightlord,” he said, and saluted. “I fought your\narmy at Slickrock, sir. Brightlord Nalanar’s second infantry. Storming fine\nbattle that was, sir.”\n“Storming fine indeed,” Dalinar said, saluting him back. “I figured your\nforces had us at three different points.”\n“Those were good times, Brightlord. Good times. Before everything\nwent wrong…” His eyes glazed over.\n“What was it like?” Dalinar asked softly. “The civil war, the battle here,\nat Vedenar?”\n“It was a nightmare, sir.”\n“Geved,” the younger man said. “Let’s go. They have food—”\n“Didn’t you hear him?” Geved said, pulling his remaining arm out of the\nboy’s grip. “He asked. Everyone dances around me, ignoring it. Storms, sir.\nThe civil war was a nightmare.”\n“Fighting other Veden families,” Dalinar said, nodding."

Storms, sir.\nThe civil war was a nightmare.”\n“Fighting other Veden families,” Dalinar said, nodding.\n“It wasn’t that,” Geved said. “Storms! We squabble as much as you do,\nsir. Pardon that. But I ain’t ever felt bad fighting my own. It’s what the\nAlmighty wants, right? But that battle…” He shuddered. “Nobody would\nstop, Brightlord. Even when it should have been done. They just kept right\non fighting. Killing because they felt like killing.”\n“It burned in us,” another wounded man said from by the food table. The\nman wore an eye patch and looked like he hadn’t shaved since the battle.\n“You know it, Brightlord, don’t you? That river inside of you, pulling your\nblood all up into your head and making you love each swing. Making it so\nthat you can’t stop, no matter how tired you are.”\nThe Thrill.\nIt started to glow inside Dalinar. So familiar, so warm, and so terrible.\nDalinar felt it stir, like … like a favorite axehound, surprised to hear its\nmaster’s voice after so long.\nHe hadn’t felt it in what seemed like an eternity. Even back on the\nShattered Plains, when he’d last felt it, it had seemed to be weakening.\nSuddenly that made sense. It wasn’t that he’d been learning to overcome the\nThrill. Instead, it had left him.\nTo come here.\n“Did others of you feel this?” Dalinar asked.\n“We all did,” another of the men said, and Geved nodded. “The\nofficers … they rode about with teeth clenched in rictus grins. Men shouted\nto keep the fight, maintain the momentum.”\nIt’s all about momentum.\nOthers agreed, talking about the remarkable haze that had covered the\nday.\nLosing any sense of peace he’d gained from the inspections, Dalinar\nexcused himself. His guards raced to keep up as he fled—moving even\nfaster as a newly arrived messenger called to him, saying he was needed\nback at the gardens.\nHe wasn’t ready. He didn’t want to face Taravangian, or Navani, or\nespecially Renarin. Instead, he climbed the city wall. Inspect … inspect the\nfortifications. That was why he’d come.\nFrom the top, he could again see those large sections of the city, burned\nand broken in the war.\nThe Thrill called to him, distant and thin. No. No. Dalinar marched along\nthe wall, passing soldiers. To his right, waves crashed against the rocks.\nShadows moved in the shallows, beasts two or three times as big as a chull,\ntheir shells peeking from the depths between waves.\nIt seemed that Dalinar had been four people in his life. The bloodlusty\nwarrior, who killed wherever he was pointed, and the consequences could\ngo to Damnation.\nThe general, who had feigned distinguished civility—when secretly, he’d\nlonged to get back on the battlefield so he could shed more blood.\nThird, the broken man. The one who paid for the actions of the youth.\nThen finally, the fourth man: most false of them all. The man who had"

The man who had\ngiven up his memories so he could pretend to be something better.\nDalinar stopped, resting one hand on the stones. His guards assembled\nbehind him. A Veden soldier approached from the other direction along the\nwall, calling out in anger. “Who are you? What are you doing up here?”\nDalinar squeezed his eyes shut.\n“You! Alethi. Answer me. Who let you scale this fortification?”\nThe Thrill stirred, and the animal inside him wanted to lash out. A fight.\nHe needed a fight.\nNo. He fled again, hurrying down a tight, constricting stone stairwell.\nHis breathing echoed against the walls, and he nearly stumbled and tripped\ndown the last flight.\nHe burst out onto the street, sweating, surprising a group of women\ncarrying water. His guards piled out after him. “Sir?” Rial asked. “Sir, are\nyou … Is everything…?”\nDalinar sucked in Stormlight, hoping it would drive away the Thrill. It\ndidn’t. It seemed to complement the sensation, driving him to act.\n“Sir?” Rial said, holding out a canteen that smelled of something strong.\n“I know you said I shouldn’t carry this, but I did. And … and you might\nneed it.”\nDalinar stared at that canteen. A pungent scent rose to envelop him. If he\ndrank that, he could forget the whispers. Forget the burned city, and what\nhe’d done to Rathalas. And to Evi.\nSo easy …\nBlood of my fathers. Please. No.\nHe spun away from Rial. He needed rest. That was all, just rest. He tried\nto keep his head up and slow his pace as he marched back toward the\nOathgate.\nThe Thrill nipped at him from behind.\nIf you become that first man again, it will stop hurting. In your youth,\nyou did what needed to be done. You were stronger then.\nHe growled, spinning and flinging his cloak to the side, looking for the\nvoice that had spoken those words. His guards shied back, gripping their\nspears tightly. The beleaguered inhabitants of Vedenar scurried away from\nhim.\nIs this leadership? To cry each night? To shake and tremble? Those are\nthe actions of a child, not a man.\n“Leave me alone!”\nGive me your pain.\nDalinar looked toward the sky and let out a raw bellow. He charged\nthrough the streets, no longer caring what people thought when they saw\nhim. He needed to be away from this city.\nThere. The steps up to the Oathgate. The people of this city had once\nmade a garden out of its platform, but that had been cleared away. Ignoring\nthe long ramp, Dalinar took the steps two at a time, Stormlight lending him\nendurance.\nAt the top, he found a cluster of guards in Kholin blue standing with\nNavani and a smattering of scribes. She immediately strode over. “Dalinar, I\ntried to ward him off, but he was insistent. I don’t know what he wants.”\n“He?” Dalinar asked, puffing from his near run."

        "text": "tried to ward him off, but he was insistent. I don’t know what he wants.”\n“He?” Dalinar asked, puffing from his near run.\nNavani gestured toward the scribes. For the first time, Dalinar noticed\nthat several among them wore the short beards of ardents. But those blue\nrobes? What were those?\nCurates, he thought, from the Holy Enclave in Valath. Technically,\nDalinar himself was a head of the Vorin religion—but in practice, the\ncurates guided church doctrine. The staves they bore were wound with\ngemstones, more ornate than he’d expected. Hadn’t most of that pomp been\ndone away with at the fall of the Hierocracy?\n“Dalinar Kholin!” one said, stepping forward. He was young for an\nardentia leader, perhaps in his early forties. His square beard was streaked\nwith a few lines of grey.\n“I am he,” Dalinar said, shrugging off Navani’s touch to his shoulder. “If\nyou would speak with me, let us retire to a place more private—”\n“Dalinar Kholin,” the ardent said, louder. “The council of curates\ndeclares you a heretic. We cannot tolerate your insistence that the Almighty\nis not God. You are hereby proclaimed excommunicate and anathema.”\n“You have no right—”\n“We have every right! The ardents must watch the lighteyes so that you\nsteer your subjects well. That is still our duty, as outlined in the Covenants\nof Theocracy, witnessed for centuries! Did you really think we would\nignore what you’ve been preaching?”\nDalinar gritted his teeth as the stupid ardent began outlining Dalinar’s\nheresies one by one, demanding that he deny them. The man stepped\nforward, close enough now that Dalinar could smell his breath.\nThe Thrill stirred, sensing a fight. Sensing blood.\nI’m going to kill him, a part of Dalinar thought. I have to run now, or I\nwill kill this man. It was as clear to him as the sun’s light.\nSo he ran.\nHe dashed to the Oathgate control building, frantic with the need to\nescape. He scrambled up to the keyhole, and only then remembered that he\ndidn’t have a Shardblade that could operate this device.\nDalinar, the Stormfather rumbled. Something is wrong. Something I\ncannot see, something hidden to me. What are you sensing?\n“I have to get away.”\nI will not be a sword to you. We spoke of this.\nDalinar growled. He felt something he could touch, something beyond\nplaces. The power that bound worlds together. His power.\nWait, the Stormfather said. This is not right!\nDalinar ignored him, reaching beyond and pulling power through.\nSomething bright white manifested in his hand, and he rammed it into the\nkeyhole.\nThe Stormfather groaned, a sound like thunder.\nThe power made the Oathgate work, regardless. As his guards called his\nname outside, Dalinar flipped the dial that would make only the small\nbuilding transport—not the entire plateau—then pushed the keyhole around\nthe outside of the room, using the power as a handhold.\nA ring of light flashed around the structure, and cold wind poured in"

He stumbled out onto a platform before Urithiru.\nThe Stormfather pulled back from him, not breaking the bond, but\nwithdrawing his favor.\nThe Thrill flooded in to replace it. Even this far away. Storms! Dalinar\ncouldn’t escape it.\nYou can’t escape yourself, Dalinar, Evi’s voice said in his mind. This is\nwho you are. Accept it.\nHe couldn’t run. Storms … he couldn’t run.\nBlood of my fathers. Please. Please, help me.\nBut … to whom was he praying?\nHe staggered down from the platform in a daze, ignoring questions from\nsoldiers and scribes alike. He made his way to his room, increasingly\ndesperate to find a way—any way—to hide from Evi’s condemning voice.\nIn his rooms, he pulled a book off the shelf. Bound in hogshide, with\nthick paper. He held The Way of Kings as if it were a talisman that would\ndrive back the pain.\nIt did nothing. Once this book had saved him, but now it seemed useless.\nHe couldn’t even read its words.\nDropping the book, he stumbled out of the room. No conscious thought\nled him to Adolin’s chambers or drove him to ransack the younger man’s\nroom. But he found what he’d hoped, a bottle of wine kept for a special\noccasion. Violet, prepared in its strength.\nThis represented that third man he’d been. Shame, frustration, and days\nspent in a haze. Terrible times. Times he’d given up part of his soul in order\nto forget.\nBut storms, it was either this or start killing again. He raised the bottle to\nhis lips.\n101. Deadeye\nMoelach is very similar to Nergaoul, though instead of inspiring a\nbattle rage, he supposedly granted visions of the future. In this, lore\nand theology align. Seeing the future originates with the Unmade, and\nis from the enemy.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 143\nAdolin tugged at the jacket, standing in Captain Ico’s cabin. The spren had\nlent the room to him for a few hours.\nThe jacket was too short, but was the biggest the spren had. Adolin had\ncut off the trousers right below the knees, then tucked the bottoms into his\nlong socks and tall boots. He rolled the sleeves of the jacket up to match,\napproximating an old style from Thaylenah. The jacket still looked too\nbaggy.\nLeave it unbuttoned, he decided. The rolled sleeves look intentional that\nway. He tucked his shirt in, pulled the belt tight. Good by contrast? He\nstudied it in the captain’s mirror. It needed a waistcoat. Those, fortunately,\nweren’t too hard to fake. Ico had provided a burgundy coat that was too\nsmall for him. He removed the collar and sleeves, stitched the rough edges\nunder, then slit it up the back.\nHe was just finishing it up with some laces on the back when Ico\nchecked in on him.

Adolin buttoned on the improvised waistcoat, threw on\nthe jacket, then presented himself with hands at his sides.\n“Very nice,” Ico said. “You look like an honorspren going to a Feast of\nLight.”\n“Thanks,” Adolin said, inspecting himself in the small mirror. “The\njacket needs to be longer, but I don’t trust myself to let down the hems.”\nIco studied him with metal eyes—bronze, with holes for the pupils, like\nAdolin had seen done for some statues. Even the spren’s hair appeared\nsculpted in place. Ico could almost have been a Soulcast king from an age\nlong past.\n“You were a ruler among your kind, weren’t you?” Ico asked. “Why did\nyou leave? The humans we get here are refugees, merchants, or explorers.\nNot kings.”\nKing. Was Adolin a king? Surely his father would decide not to continue\nwith the abdication, now that Elhokar had passed.\n“No answer?” Ico said. “That is fine. But you were a ruler among them. I\ncan read it in you. Highborn status is important to humans.”\n“Maybe a little too important, eh?” Adolin said, adjusting the neck scarf\nhe’d made from his handkerchief.\n“That is true,” Ico said. “You are all human—and so none of you,\nregardless of birth, can be trusted with oaths. A contract to travel, this is\nfine. But humans will betray trust if it is given to them.” The spren frowned,\nthen seemed to grow embarrassed, glancing away. “That was rude.”\n“Rudeness doesn’t necessarily imply untruth though.”\n“I did not mean an insult, regardless. You are not to be blamed.\nBetraying oaths is simply your nature, as a human.”\n“You don’t know my father,” Adolin said. Still, the conversation left him\nuncomfortable. Not because of Ico’s words—spren tended to say odd\nthings, and Adolin didn’t take offense.\nMore, he felt his own growing worry that he might actually have to take\nthe throne. He’d grown up knowing it could happen, but he’d also grown up\nwishing—desperately—that it never would. In his quiet moments, he’d\nassumed this hesitance was because a king couldn’t apply himself to things\nlike dueling and … well … enjoying life.\nWhat if it went deeper? What if he’d always known inconsistency lurked\nwithin him? He couldn’t keep pretending he was the man his father wanted\nhim to be.\nWell, it was moot anyway—Alethkar, as a nation, had fallen. He\naccompanied Ico back out of the captain’s cabin onto the deck, walking\nover to Shallan, Kaladin, and Azure, who stood by the starboard wale. Each\nwore a shirt, trousers, and jacket they’d bought off the Reachers with dun\nspheres.

That befuddled expression alone made\nthe work worthwhile.\n“How?” Kaladin demanded. “Did you sew that?”\nAdolin grinned. Kaladin looked like a man trying to wear his childhood\nsuit; he’d never button that coat across his broad chest. Shallan fit her shirt\nand jacket better from a pure measurements standpoint, but the cut wasn’t\nflattering. Azure looked far more … normal without her dramatic\nbreastplate and cloak.\n“I’d practically kill for a skirt,” Shallan noted.\n“You’re kidding,” Azure said.\n“No. I’m getting tired of the way trousers rub my legs. Adolin, could you\nsew me a dress? Maybe stitch the legs of these trousers together?”\nHe rubbed his chin, which had begun to sprout a blond beard. “It doesn’t\nwork that way—I can’t magic more cloth out of nothing. It…”\nHe trailed off as, overhead, the clouds suddenly rippled, glowing with a\nstrange mother-of-pearl iridescence. Another highstorm, their second since\narriving in Shadesmar. The group stopped and stared up at the dramatic\nlight show. Nearby, the Reachers seemed to stand up more straight, move\nabout their sailing duties more vigorously.\n“See,” Azure said. “I told you. They must feed off it, somehow.”\nShallan narrowed her eyes, then grabbed her sketchbook and stalked\nover to begin interviewing some of the spren. Kaladin trailed away to join\nhis spren at the prow of the ship, where she liked to stand. Adolin often\nnoticed him looking southward, as if anxiously wishing the ship to move\nmore quickly.\nHe lingered by the side of the ship, watching the beads crash away\nbelow. When he looked up, he found Azure studying him. “Did you really\nsew that?” she asked.\n“There wasn’t much sewing involved,” Adolin said. “The scarf and\njacket hide most of the damage I did to the waistcoat—which used to be a\nsmaller jacket.”\n“Still,” she said. “An unusual skill for a royal.”\n“And how many royals have you known?”\n“More than some might assume.”\nAdolin nodded. “I see. And are you enigmatic on purpose, or is it kind of\nan accidental thing?”\nAzure leaned against the ship’s wale, breeze blowing her short hair. She\nlooked more youthful when not wearing the breastplate and cloak. Mid-\nthirties, maybe. “A little of both. I discovered when I was younger that\nbeing too open with strangers … went poorly for me. But in answer to your\nquestion, I have known royals. Including one woman who left it behind.\nThrone, family, responsibilities…”\n“She abandoned her duty?” That was practically inconceivable.\n“The throne was better served by someone who enjoyed sitting on it.”\n“Duty isn’t about what you enjoy. It’s about doing what is demanded of\nyou, in serving the greater good. You can’t just abandon responsibility\nbecause you feel like it.”\nAzure glanced at Adolin, and he felt himself blush. “Sorry,” he said,\nlooking away. “My father and my uncle might have … instilled me with a"

I always find myself in situations like in\nKholinar, leading the Wall Guard. I get too involved … then abandon\neveryone.…”\n“You didn’t abandon the Wall Guard, Azure,” Adolin said. “You couldn’t\nhave prevented what happened.”\n“Perhaps. I can’t help feeling that this is merely one in a long string of\nduties abdicated, of burdens set down, perhaps to disastrous results.” For\nsome reason, she put her hand on the pommel of her Shardblade when she\nsaid that. Then she looked up at Adolin. “But of all the things I’ve walked\naway from, the one I don’t regret is allowing someone else to rule.\nSometimes, the best way to do your duty is to let someone else—someone\nmore capable—try carrying it.”\nSuch a foreign idea. Sometimes you took up a duty that wasn’t yours, but\nabandoning one? Just … giving it to someone else?\nHe found himself musing on that. He nodded his thanks to Azure as she\nexcused herself to get something to drink. He was still standing there when\nShallan returned from interviewing—well, interrogating—the Reachers.\nShe took his arm, and together they watched the shimmering clouds for a\nwhile.\n“I look terrible, don’t I?” she finally asked, nudging him in the side. “No\nmakeup, with hair that hasn’t been washed in days, and now wearing a\ndumpy set of worker’s clothing.”\n“I don’t think you’re capable of looking terrible,” he said, pulling her\ncloser. “In all their color, even those clouds can’t compete.”\nThey passed through a sea of floating candle flames, which represented a\nvillage on the human side. The flames were huddled together in patches.\nHiding from the storm.\nEventually the clouds faded—but they were supposedly near the city\nnow, so Shallan got excited, watching for it. Finally, she pointed to land on\nthe horizon.\nCelebrant nestled not far down its coast. As they drew closer, they\nspotted other ships entering or leaving the port, each pulled by at least two\nmandras.\nCaptain Ico walked over. “We’ll soon arrive. Let’s go get your deadeye.”\nAdolin nodded, patting Shallan on the back, and followed Ico down to\nthe brig, a small room far aft in the cargo hold. Ico used keys to unlock the\ndoor, revealing the spren of Adolin’s sword sitting on a bench inside. She\nlooked at him with those haunting scratched-out eyes, her string face void\nof emotion.\n“I wish you hadn’t locked her in here,” Adolin said, stooping down to\npeer through the squat doorway.\n“Can’t have them on deck,” Ico said. “They don’t watch where they’re\nwalking and fall off. I’m not going to spend days trying to fish out a lost\ndeadeye.”\nShe moved to join Adolin, then Ico reached over to shut the cell."

He’ll go searching\nfor the human carrying his corpse, otherwise. Walk right off the deck.”\n“Your father was a Radiant spren?”\nIco started toward the steps up to the deck. “It is rude to ask about such\nones.”\n“Rudeness doesn’t imply untruth though, right?”\nIco turned and regarded him, then smiled wanly and nodded toward\nAdolin’s spren. “What is she to you?”\n“A friend.”\n“A tool.

Just … don’t pretend she is your friend.”\nBy the time they reached the deck, the ship was approaching the docks.\nIco started calling orders, though his crew clearly knew what to do already.\nThe Celebrant docks were wide and large, longer than the city. Ships\npulled in along stone piers, though Adolin couldn’t figure out how they got\nback out again. Hook the mandras to the stern and pull them out that way?\nThe shore was marked by long warehouses set in rows, which marred the\nview of the city proper, in Adolin’s opinion. The ship drew up at a berth on\na specific pier, guided by a Reacher with semaphore. Ico’s sailors unlatched\na piece of the hull, which unfolded to steps, and a sailor hiked down\nimmediately to greet another group of Reachers. These began unlatching\nthe mandras with long hooks, leading them away.\nAs each flying spren was released from the rigging, the ship sank a little\nfarther into the bead ocean. Eventually, it seemed to settle onto some braces\nand steady there.\nPattern came over, humming to himself and meeting the rest of them as\nthey gathered on the deck. Ico stepped up, gesturing. “A deal fulfilled, and a\nbond kept.”\n“Thank you, Captain,” Adolin said, shaking Ico’s hand. Ico returned the\ngesture awkwardly. He obviously knew what to do, but was unpracticed at\nit. “You’re sure you won’t take us the rest of the way to the portal between\nrealms?”\n“I’m certain,” Ico said firmly. “The region around Cultivation’s\nPerpendicularity has gained a poor reputation of late. Too many ships\nvanishing.”\n“What about Thaylen City?” Kaladin asked. “Could you take us there?”\n“No. I unload goods here, and then head east. Away from trouble. And if\nyou’ll accept a little advice, stay in Shadesmar. The Physical Realm is not a\nwelcoming place these days.”\n“We’ll take that under advisement,” Adolin said. “Is there anything we\nshould know about the city?”"

Try not to draw too many lesser spren, and maybe\nsee if you can find a place to tie up that deadeye of yours.” He pointed.\n“The dock registrar is that building ahead of us, with the blue paint. There\nyou’ll find a list of ships willing to take on passengers—but you’ll have to\ngo to each one individually and make sure they are equipped to take\nhumans, and haven’t already booked all their cabins.\n“The building next to that is a moneychanger, where you can trade\nStormlight for notes of exchange.” He shook his head. “My daughter used\nto work there, before she ran off chasing stupid dreams.”\nHe bade them farewell, and the group of travelers walked down the\ngangway onto the docks. Curiously, Syl still wore an illusion, making her\nface an Alethi tan, her hair black, her clothing red. Was being an honorspren\nreally that big a deal?\n“So,” Adolin said as they reached the pier, “how are we going to do this?\nIn the city, I mean.”\n“I’ve counted out our marks,” Shallan said, holding up a bag of spheres.\n“It’s been long enough since they were renewed, they’ll almost certainly\nlose their Stormlight in the next few days. A few have already gone out. We\nmight as well trade for supplies—we can keep the broams and the larger\ngemstones for Surgebinding.”\n“First stop is the moneychanger, then,” Adolin said.\n“After that, we should see if we can buy more rations,” Kaladin said,\n“just in case. And we need to look for passage.”\n“But to where?” Azure said. “The perpendicularity, or Thaylen City?”\n“Let’s see what our options are,” Adolin decided. “Maybe there will be a\nship to one destination, but not the other. Let’s send one group to inquire\nwith ships, and another to get supplies. Shallan, do you have a preference\nwhich you’d rather do?”\n“I’ll look for passage,” she said. “I have experience with it—I made a lot\nof trips when chasing down Jasnah.”\n“Sounds good,” Adolin said. “We should put one Radiant in each group,\nso bridgeboy and Syl, you’ll go with me. Pattern and Azure will go with\nShallan.”\n“Maybe I should help Shallan—” Syl began.\n“We’ll need a spren with us,” Adolin said. “To explain culture here. Let’s\ngo trade in those spheres first, though.”\n102. Celebrant\nMoelach was said to grant visions of the future at different times—but\nmost commonly at the transition point between realms.

After Shallan had taken the deadeye’s hand, she had remained\nbehind.\nReaching this city marked a welcome step forward, toward finally\ngetting out of this place and reaching Dalinar. Unfortunately, a brand-new\ncity full of unknown threats didn’t encourage him to relax.\nThe city wasn’t as densely populated as most human ones, but the\nvariety of spren was stunning. Reachers like Ico and his sailors were\ncommon, but there were also spren that looked much like Adolin’s sword—\nat least before she’d been killed. They were made entirely of vines, though\nthey had crystal hands and wore human clothing. Equally common were\nspren with inky black skin that shone with a variety of colors when light hit\nthem right. Their clothing seemed part of them, like that of the Cryptics and\nhonorspren.\nA small group of Cryptics passed nearby, huddling close together as they\nwalked. Each had a head with a slightly different pattern. There were other\nspren with skin like cracked stone, molten light shining from within. Still\nothers had skin the color of old white ashes—and when Kaladin saw one of\nthese point toward something, the skin stretching at the joint of his arm\ndisintegrated and blew away, revealing the joint and knobs of the humerus.\nThe skin quickly regrew.\nThe variety reminded Kaladin of the costumes of the Cult of Moments—\nthough he didn’t spot a single honorspren. And it didn’t seem like the other\nspren mixed much. Humans were rare enough that the three of them—\nincluding Syl, imitating an Alethi—turned heads.\nBuildings were constructed using bricks in a variety of colors or blocks\nof many different types of stone. Each building was a hodgepodge of\nmaterials with no pattern Kaladin could determine.\n“How do they get building materials?” Kaladin asked as they followed\nthe moneychanger’s instructions toward the nearby market. “Are there\nquarries on this side?”\nSyl frowned. “I…” She cocked her head. “You know, I’m not sure. I\nthink maybe we make it appear on this side, somehow, from yours? Like\nIco did with the ice?”\n“They seem to wear whatever,” Adolin said, pointing. “That’s an Alethi\nofficer’s coat over an Azish scribe’s vest. Tashikki wrap worn with trousers,\nand there’s almost a full Thaylen tlmko, but they’re missing the boots.”\n“No children,” Kaladin noticed.\n“There have been a few,” Syl said. “They just don’t look little, like\nhuman children.”\n“How does that even work?” Adolin said.\n“Well, it’s certainly less messy than your method!” She scrunched her\nface up. “We’re made of power, bits of gods. There are places where that\npower coalesces, and parts start to be aware. You go, and then come back\nwith a child? I think?”\nAdolin chuckled.\n“What?” Kaladin asked.\n“That’s actually not that different from what my nanny told me when I\nasked her where children come from. A nonsense story about parents baking\na new child out of crem clay.”\n“It doesn’t happen often,” Syl said as they passed a group of the ash-\ncolored spren sitting around a table and watching the crowds.

They eyed the\nhumans with overt hostility, and one flicked fingers toward Kaladin. Those\nfingers exploded to bits of dust, leaving bones that grew back the flesh.\n“Raising children doesn’t happen often?” Adolin asked.\nSyl nodded. “It’s rare. Most spren will go hundreds of years without\ndoing it.”\nHundreds of years. “Storms,” Kaladin whispered, considering it. “Most\nof these spren are that old?”\n“Or older,” Syl said. “But aging isn’t the same with spren. Like time\nisn’t. We don’t learn as fast, or change much, without a bond.”\nTowers in the city’s center showed the time by way of fires burning in a\nset of vertical holes—so they could judge how to meet back with the others\nin an hour, as agreed. The market turned out to be mostly roofless stalls\nopen to the air, with goods piled on tables. Even in comparison to the\nimprovised market of Urithiru, this seemed … ephemeral to Kaladin. But\nthere were no stormwinds to worry about here, so it probably made sense.\nThey passed a clothing stall, and of course Adolin insisted on stopping.\nThe oily spren who managed the place had an odd, very terse way of\ntalking, with a strange use of words. But it did speak Alethi, unlike most of\nIco’s crew.\nKaladin waited for the prince to finish, until Syl stepped up and\npresented herself in an oversized poncho tied with a belt. On her head she\nwore a large, floppy hat.\n“What’s that?” Kaladin asked.\n“Clothes!”\n“Why do you need clothes? Yours are built in.”\n“Those are boring.”\n“Can’t you change them?”\n“Takes Stormlight, on this side,” she said. “Plus, the dress is part of my\nessence, so I’m actually walking around naked all the time.”\n“It’s not the same.”\n“Easy for you to say. We bought you clothing. You have three sets!”\n“Three?” he said, looking down at his clothing. “I have my uniform, and\nthis one Ico gave me.”\n“Plus the one you’re wearing underneath that one.”\n“Underwear?” Kaladin said.\n“Yeah. That means you have three sets of clothing, while I have none.”\n“We need two sets so one can be washed while we wear the other.”\n“Just so you won’t be stinky.” She rolled her eyes in an exaggerated way.\n“Look, you can give these to Shallan when I get bored with them. You\nknow she likes hats.”\nThat was true. He sighed, and when Adolin returned with another set of\nunderclothing for each of them—along with a skirt for Shallan—Kaladin\nhad him haggle for the clothing Syl was wearing too. The prices were\nshockingly cheap, using a tiny fraction of the money from their writ.\nThey continued on, passing stalls that sold building materials.

Syl seemed to think the difference had to do with how permanent the\nthing was in Shadesmar—which made Kaladin worry for the clothing\nthey’d bought.\nThey found a place selling weapons, and Adolin tried to negotiate while\nKaladin browsed. Some kitchen knives. A few hand axes. And sitting in a\nlocked, glass-topped box, a long thin silvery chain.\n“You like?” the shopkeeper asked. She was made of vines—her face\nformed as if from green string—and wore a havah with a crystal safehand\nexposed. “Only a thousand broams of Stormlight.”\n“A thousand broams?” Kaladin asked. He looked down at the box, which\nwas locked to the table and guarded by small orange spren that looked like\npeople. “No thanks.” The pricing here really was bizarre.\nThe swords proved more expensive than Adolin wanted, but he did buy\nthem two harpoons—and Kaladin felt a lot more secure once one was\nplaced in his hands. Walking on, Kaladin noted that Syl was hunkered down\nin her oversized poncho, her hair tucked into the collar and her hat pulled\ndown to shadow her face. It seemed like she didn’t trust Shallan’s illusion to\nkeep her from being recognized as an honorspren.\nThe food stall they found had mostly more “cans” like those on the ship.\nAdolin started haggling, and Kaladin settled in for another wait, scanning\nthose who passed on the pathway for danger. He found his eyes drawn,\nhowever, to a stall across from them. Selling art.\nKaladin had never had much time for art. Either the picture depicted\nsomething useful—like a map—or it was basically pointless. And yet,\nnestled among the paintings for display was a small one painted from thick\nstrokes of oil. White and red, with lines of black. When he looked away, he\nfound himself drawn back toward it, studying the way the highlights played\noff those dark lines.\nLike nine shadows … he thought. With a figure kneeling in the middle …\n* * *\nThe ashen spren waved excitedly, pointing to the east and then making a\ncutting motion. She spoke a language Shallan couldn’t understand, but\nfortunately Pattern could interpret.\n“Ah…” he said. “Mmm, yes. I see. She will not sail back to Cultivation’s\nPerpendicularity. Mmm. No, she will not go.”\n“Same excuse?” Shallan asked.\n“Yes. Voidspren sailing warships and demanding tribute from any who\napproach. Oh! She says she would rather trade with honorspren than take\nanother trip to the perpendicularity. I think this is an insult. Ha ha ha.\nMmm…”\n“Voidspren,” Azure said. “Can she at least explain what that means?”\nThe ashen spren began speaking quickly after Pattern asked. “Hmm …\nThere are many varieties, she says. Some of golden light, others are red\nshadows. Curious, yes. And it sounds like some of the Fused are with them\n—men with shells that can fly. I did not know this.”\n“What?” Azure prompted.\n“Shadesmar has been changing these last months,” Pattern explained."

        "text": "—men with shells that can fly. I did not know this.”\n“What?” Azure prompted.\n“Shadesmar has been changing these last months,” Pattern explained.\n“Voidspren have arrived mysteriously just west of the Nexus of\nImagination. Near Marat or Tukar on your side. Hmm … and they have\nsailed up and seized the perpendicularity. She says, ahem, ‘You need but\nspit into a crowd, and you’ll find one, these days.’ Ha ha ha. I do not think\nshe actually has spit.”\nShallan and Azure shared a look as the sailor retreated onto her ship, to\nwhich mandras were being harnessed. The spren of Adolin’s sword lingered\nnearby, seeming content to stay where told. Passersby looked away from\nher, as if embarrassed to see her there.\n“Well, the dock registrar was right,” Azure said, folding her arms. “No\nships sailing toward the peaks or toward Thaylen City. Those destinations\nare too close to enemy holdings.”\n“Maybe we should try for the Shattered Plains instead,” Shallan said.\nThat meant going east—a direction ships were more likely to travel, these\ndays. It would mean going away from both what Kaladin and Azure\nwanted, but at least it would be something.\nIf they got there, she’d still need to find a way to engage the Oathgate on\nthis side. What if she failed? She imagined them trapped in some far-off\nlocation, surrounded by beads, slowly starving.…\n“Let’s keep asking the ships on our list,” she said, leading the way. The\nnext ship in line was a long, stately vessel made of white wood with golden\ntrim. Its entire presentation seemed to say, Good luck affording me. Even\nthe mandras being led toward it from one of the warehouses wore gold\nharnesses.\nAccording to the list from the dock registrar, this was heading someplace\ncalled Lasting Integrity—which was to the southwest. That was kind of the\ndirection Kaladin wanted to go, so Shallan had Pattern stop one of the\ngrooms and ask if the captain of the ship would be likely to take human\npassengers.\nThe groom, a spren that looked like she was made of fog or mist, merely\nlaughed and walked off as if she’d heard a grand joke.\n“I suppose,” Azure said, “we should take that for a no.”\nThe next ship in line was a sleek vessel that looked fast to Shallan’s\nuntrained eyes. A good choice, the registrar had noted, and likely to be\nwelcoming toward humans. Indeed, a spren working on the deck waved as\nthey approached. He put one booted foot up on the side of his ship and\nlooked down with a grin.\nWhat kind of spren, Shallan thought, has skin like cracked rock? He\nglowed deep within, as if molten on the inside. “Humans?” he called in\nVeden, reading Shallan’s hair as a sign of her heritage. “You’re far from\nhome. Or close, I suppose, just in the wrong realm!”\n“We’re looking for passage,” Shallan called up. “Where are you\nsailing?”\n“East!” he said. “Toward Freelight!”\n“Could we potentially negotiate passage?”\n“Sure!” he called down. “Always interesting to have humans aboard."

Ha! But negotiations will have to wait. We’ve\ngot an inspection soon. Come back in a half hour.”\nThe dock registrar had mentioned this; an official inspection of the ships\nhappened at first hour every day. Shallan and the team backed off, and she\nsuggested returning to their meeting place near the dock registrar. As they\napproached, Shallan could see that Ico’s ship was already under inspection\nby a dock official—another spren made of vines and crystal.\nMaybe we could convince Ico to take us, if we just tried harder. Perhaps\n—\nAzure’s breath caught and she grabbed Shallan by the shoulder, yanking\nher into an alley between two warehouses, out of sight of the ship.\n“Damnation!”\n“What?” Shallan demanded as Pattern and, lethargically, Adolin’s spren\njoined them.\n“Look up there,” Azure said. “Talking with Ico, on the poop deck.”\nShallan frowned, then peeked out, spotting what she’d missed earlier: A\nfigure stood up there, with the marbled skin of a parshman. He floated a foot\nor two off the deck next to Ico, looming like a stern tutor over a foolish\nstudent.\nThe spren with the vines and crystal body walked up, reporting to this\none.\n“Perhaps,” Azure said, “we should have asked who runs the\ninspections.”\n* * *\nKaladin’s harpoon drew nervous glances as he crossed the pathway between\nstalls, to get a closer look at the painting.\nCan spren even be hurt in this realm? a part of him wondered. The\nsailors wouldn’t carry harpoons if things couldn’t be killed on this side,\nright? He’d have to ask Syl, once she was done interpreting for Adolin.\nKaladin stepped up to the painting. The ones beside it showed far more\ntechnical prowess—they were capable portraits, perfectly capturing their\nhuman subjects. This one was sloppy by comparison. It looked like the\npainter had simply taken a knife covered in paint and slopped it onto the\ncanvas, making general shapes.\nHaunting, beautiful shapes. Mostly reds and whites, but with a figure at\nthe center, throwing out nine shadows …\nDalinar, he thought. I failed Elhokar. After all we went through, after the\nrains and confronting Moash, I’ve failed. And I lost your city.\nHe reached up his fingers to touch the painting.\n“Marvelous, isn’t it!” a spren said.\nKaladin jumped, sheepishly lowering his fingers. The proprietor of this\nstall was a Reacher woman, short, with a bronze ponytail.\n“It’s a unique piece, human,” she said. “From the far-off Court of Gods,\na painting intended only for a divinity to see. It is exceptionally rare that\none escapes being burned at the court, and makes its way onto the market.”\n“Nine shadows,” Kaladin said. “The Unmade?”\n“This is a piece by Nenefra.

He had to be there on\ntime—\nWhat was that disturbance behind him?\nKaladin shook out of his reverie and glanced over his shoulder, just in\ntime to see Adolin jogging toward him.\n“We have a problem,” the prince said.\n* * *\n“How could you not mention this!” Shallan said to the little spren at the\nregistrar office. “How could you neglect to point out that Voidspren ruled\nthe city?”\n“I thought everyone knew!” he said, vines curling and moving at the\ncorners of his face. “Oh dear. Oh my! Anger is not helpful, human. I am a\nprofessional. It is not my job to explain things you should already know!”\n“He’s still on Ico’s ship,” Azure said, looking out the office window.\n“Why is he still on Ico’s ship?”\n“That is odd,” the spren said. “Each inspection usually takes only\nthirteen minutes!”\nDamnation. Shallan breathed out, trying to calm herself. Coming back to\nthe registrar had been a calculated risk. He was probably working with the\nFused, but they hoped to intimidate him into talking.\n“When did it happen?” Shallan asked. “My spren friend told us this was\na free city.”\n“It’s been months now,” the vine spren said. “Oh, they don’t have firm\ncontrol here, mind you. Just a few officials, and promises from our leaders\nto follow. Two Fused check in on us now and then. I think the other is quite\ninsane. Kyril—who is running the inspections—well, he might be mad too,\nactually. You see, when he gets angry—”\n“Damnation!” Azure cursed.\n“What?”\n“He just set Ico’s ship on fire.”\n* * *\nKaladin ran back across the street to find Syl a center of activity. She had\npulled her oversized hat down to obscure her face, but a collection of spren\nstood around the food stall, pointing at her and talking.\nKaladin shoved his way through, took Syl by the arm, and pulled her\naway from the stall. Adolin followed, holding his harpoon in one hand and a\nsack of food in the other. He looked threateningly toward the spren in the\ngathered crowd, who didn’t give chase.\n“They recognize you,” Kaladin said to Syl. “Even with the illusory skin\ncolor.”\n“Uh … maybe…”\n“Syl.”\nShe held to her hat with one hand, her other arm in his hand as he towed\nher through the street. “So … you know how I mentioned I snuck away\nfrom the other honorspren…”\n“Yes.”\n“So, there might have been an enormous reward for my return.

And I doubt I’ve been forgiven—the\nothers on the Shattered Plains wouldn’t talk to me. As far as they’re\nconcerned, I’m a disobedient child. There’s still an incredible reward in\nStormlight to be given to the person that delivers me to the honorspren\ncapital, Lasting Integrity.”\n“And you didn’t think this was important to tell me?”\n“Sure I did. Right now.”\nThey stopped to allow Adolin to catch up. The spren back at the food\nstall were still talking. Storms. This news would spread throughout\nCelebrant before long.\nKaladin glared at Syl, who pulled down into the oversized poncho she’d\nbought. “Azure is a bounty hunter,” she said in a small voice. “And I’m …\nI’m kind of like a spren lighteyes. I didn’t want you to know. In case you\nhated me, like you hate them.”\nKaladin sighed, taking her by the arm again and pulling her toward the\ndocks.\n“I should have known this disguise wouldn’t work,” she added. “I’m\nobviously too beautiful and interesting to hide.”\n“News of this might make it hard to get passage,” Kaladin said. “We…”\nHe stopped in the street. “Is that smoke up ahead?”\n* * *\nThe Fused touched down on the quay, tossing Ico to the ground of the\ndocks. Behind, Ico’s ship had become a raging bonfire—the other sailors\nand inspectors scrambled down the gangway in a frantic jumble.\nShallan watched from the window. Her breath caught as the Fused lifted\na few inches off the ground, then glided toward the registrar’s building.\nShe sucked in Stormlight by reflex. “Look frightened!” she said to the\nothers. She grabbed Adolin’s spren by the arm and pulled her to the side of\nthe clerk’s room.\nThe Fused burst in and found them cringing, wearing the faces of sailors\nthat Shallan had sketched. Pattern was the oddest one, his strange head\nneeding to be covered by a hat to have any semblance of looking realistic.\nPlease don’t notice we’re the same sailors as on the ship. Please.\nThe Fused ignored them, gliding up to the frightened vine spren behind\nthe desk.\n“That ship was hiding human criminals,” Pattern whispered, translating\nthe Fused’s conversation with the registrar. “They had a hydrator and\nremnants of human food—eaten—on the deck. There are two or three\nhumans, one honorspren, and one inkspren. Have you seen these\ncriminals?”\nThe vine spren cringed down by the desk. “They went to the market for\nneeded supplies. They asked me for ships that would get them passage to\nthe perpendicularity.”\n“You hid this from me?”\n“Why does everyone assume I’ll just tell them things?

He looked to them. “You …\nyou are a Radiant?

Perhaps it was the postures of the people farther down the\nstreet. He reacted before he understood what it was, grabbing Syl and\nAdolin, pulling them all into a tent at the edge of the market.\nA Fused soared past outside, its shadow trailing behind, pointing the\nwrong direction.\n“Storms!” Adolin said. “Nice work, Kal.”\nThe tent was occupied only by a single bewildered spren made of smoke,\nlooking odd in a green cap and what seemed to be Horneater clothing.\n“Out,” Kaladin said, the smell of smoke on the air filling him with dread.\nThey hurried down an alleyway between warehouses, out onto the docks.\nFarther down, Ico’s ship burned brilliantly. There was chaos on the docks\nas spren ran in all directions, shouting in their strange language.\nSyl gasped, pointing at a ship bedecked in white and gold. “We have to\nhide. Now.”\n“Honorspren?” Kaladin asked.\n“Yeah.”\n“Pull down your hat, go back into the alley.” Kaladin scanned the crowd.\n“Adolin, do you see the others?”\n“No,” he said. “Ishar’s soul! There’s no water to put that fire out. It will\nburn for hours. What happened?”\nOne of Ico’s sailors stepped from the crowd. “I saw a flash from\nsomething the Fused was holding. I think he intended to frighten Ico, but\nstarted the fire by accident.”\nWait, Kaladin thought. Was that Alethi? “Shallan?” he asked as four\nReachers gathered around.\n“I’m right here,” said a different one. “We are in trouble. The only ship\nthat might have agreed to give us passage is that one there.”"

The only ship\nthat might have agreed to give us passage is that one there.”\n“The one sailing away at full speed?” Kaladin said with a sigh.\n“Nobody else would consider taking us on,” Azure said. “And they were\nall heading the wrong directions anyway. We’re about to be stranded.”\n“We could try fighting our way onto a ship,” Kaladin said. “Take control\nof it, maybe?”\nAdolin shook his head. “I think that would take long enough—and make\nenough trouble—that the Fused would find us.”\n“Well, maybe I could fight him,” Kaladin said. “Only one enemy. I\nshould be able to take him.”\n“Using all our Stormlight in the process?” Shallan asked.\n“I’m just trying to think of something!”\n“Guys,” Syl said. “I might have an idea. A great bad idea.”\n“The Fused went looking for you,” Shallan said to Kaladin. “It flew to\nthe market.”\n“It passed us.”\n“Guys?”\n“Not for long though. It’s going to turn around soon.”\n“Turns out Syl has a bounty on her head.”\n“Guys?”\n“We need a plan,” Kaladin said. “If nobody…” He trailed off.\nSyl had started running toward the majestic white and gold ship, which\nwas slowly being pulled away from the docks. She threw down her poncho\nand hat, then screamed up at the ship while running along the pier beside it.\n“Hey!” she screamed. “Hey, look down here!”\nThe vessel stopped ponderously, handlers slowing its mandras. Three\nblue-white honorspren appeared at the side, looking down with utter shock.\n“Sylphrena, the Ancient Daughter?” one shouted.\n“That’s me!” she shouted back. “You’d better catch me before I scamper\naway! Wow! I’m feeling capricious today. I might just vanish again, off to\nwhere nobody can find me!”\nIt worked.\nA gangway dropped, and Syl scrambled up onto the ship—followed by\nthe rest of them. Kaladin went last, watching nervously over his shoulder,\nexpecting the Fused to come after them at any moment. It did, but it stopped\nat the mouth of the alleyway, watching them board the ship. Honorspren\ngave it pause, apparently.\nOn board, Kaladin discovered that most of the sailors were those spren\nmade of fog or mist. One of these was tying Syl’s arms together with rope.\nKaladin tried to intervene, but Syl shook her head. “Not now,” she mouthed.\nFine. He would argue with the honorspren later.\nThe ship pulled away, joining others that fled the city. The honorspren\ndidn’t pay much mind to Kaladin and the others—though one did take their\nharpoons, and another went through their pockets, confiscating their infused\ngemstones.\nAs the city grew smaller, Kaladin caught sight of the Fused hovering\nover the docks, beside the smoke trail of a burning ship.\nIt finally streaked off in the other direction.\n103.

Proof is easy to provide: the\neffect is regionalized, and tends to move across Roshar. This is the\nroving of the Unmade.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 170\nDalinar started awake in an unfamiliar place, lying on a floor of cut stone,\nhis back stiff. He blinked sleepily, trying to orient himself. Storms … where\nwas he?\nSoft sunlight shone through an open balcony on the far side of the room,\nand ethereal motes of dust danced in the streams of light. What were those\nsounds? They seemed like the voices of people, but muffled.\nDalinar stood, then fastened the side of his uniform jacket, which had\ncome undone. It had been … what, three days since his return from Jah\nKeved? His excommunication from the Vorin church?\nHe remembered those days as a haze of frustration, sorrow, agony. And\ndrink. A great deal of drink. He’d been using the stupor to drive away the\npain. A terrible bandage for his wounds, blood seeping out on all sides. But\nso far, it had kept him alive.\nI know this room, he realized, glancing at the mural on the ceiling. I saw\nit in one of my visions. A highstorm must have come while he was passed\nout.\n“Stormfather?” Dalinar called, his voice echoing. “Stormfather, why\nhave you sent me a vision? We agreed they were too dangerous.”\nYes, he remembered this place well. This was the vision where he’d met\nNohadon, author of The Way of Kings. Why wasn’t it playing out as it had\nbefore? He and Nohadon had walked to the balcony, talked for a time, then\nthe vision had ended.\nDalinar started toward the balcony, but storms, that light was so intense.\nIt washed over him, making his eyes water, and he had to raise his hand to\nshield his eyes.\nHe heard something behind him. Scratching? He turned—putting his\nback to the brilliance—and spotted a door on the wall. It swung open easily\nbeneath his touch, and he stepped out of the loud sunlight to find himself in\na circular room.\nHe shut the door with a click. This chamber was much smaller than the\nprevious one, with a wooden floor. Windows in the walls looked out at a\nclear sky. A shadow passed over one of these, like something enormous\nmoving in front of the sun. But … how could the sun be pointed this\ndirection too?\nDalinar looked over his shoulder at the wooden door. No light peeked\nunderneath it. He frowned and reached for the handle, then paused, hearing\nthe scratching once more. Turning, he saw a large desk, heaped with papers,\nby the wall. How had he missed that earlier?\nA man sat at the desk, lit by a loose diamond, writing with a reed pen."

        "text": "by the wall. How had he missed that earlier?\nA man sat at the desk, lit by a loose diamond, writing with a reed pen.\nNohadon had aged. In the previous vision, the king had been young—but\nnow his hair was silver, his skin marked by wrinkles. It was the same man\nthough, same face shape, same beard that came to a point. He wrote with\nfocused concentration.\nDalinar stepped over. “The Way of Kings,” he whispered. “I’m watching\nit be written.…”\n“Actually,” Nohadon said, “it’s a shopping list. I’ll be cooking Shin loaf\nbread today, if I can get the ingredients. It always breaks people’s brains.\nGrain was not meant to be so fluffy.”\nWhat…? Dalinar scratched at the side of his head.\nNohadon finished with a flourish and tossed the pen down. He threw\nback his chair and stood, grinning like a fool, and grabbed Dalinar by the\narms. “Good to see you again, my friend. You’ve been having a hard time of\nit lately, haven’t you?”\n“You have no idea,” Dalinar whispered, wondering who Nohadon saw\nhim as. In the previous vision, Dalinar had appeared as one of Nohadon’s\nadvisors. They’d stood together on the balcony as Nohadon contemplated a\nwar to unite the world. A drastic resort, intended to prepare mankind for the\nnext Desolation.\nCould that morose figure have really become this spry and eager? And\nwhere had this vision come from? Hadn’t the Stormfather told Dalinar that\nhe’d seen them all?\n“Come,” Nohadon said, “let’s go to the market. A little shopping to turn\nyour mind from your troubles.”\n“Shopping?”\n“Yes, you shop, don’t you?”\n“I … usually have people to do that for me.”\n“Ah, but of course you do,” Nohadon said. “Very like you to miss a\nsimple joy so you can get to something more ‘important.’ Well, come on.\nI’m the king. You can’t very well say no, now can you?”\nNohadon led Dalinar back through the door. The light was gone. They\ncrossed to the balcony, which—last time—had overlooked death and\ndesolation. Now, it looked out on a bustling city full of energetic people and\nrolling carts. The sound of the place crashed into Dalinar, as if it had been\nsuppressed until that moment. Laughing, chatting, calling. Wagons\ncreaking. Chulls bleating.\nThe men wore long skirts, tied at the waists by wide girdles, some of\nwhich came all the way up over their stomachs. Above that they had bare\nchests, or wore simple overshirts. The outfits resembled the takama Dalinar\nhad worn when younger, though of a far, far older style. The tubular gowns\non the women were even stranger, made of layered small rings of cloth with\ntassels on the bottom. They seemed to ripple as they moved.\nThe women’s arms were bare up to the shoulders. No safehand covering.\nIn the previous vision, I spoke the Dawnchant, Dalinar remembered. The\nwords that gave Navani’s scholars a starting point to translate ancient texts."

The\nwords that gave Navani’s scholars a starting point to translate ancient texts.\n“How do we get down?” Dalinar asked, seeing no ladder.\nNohadon leaped off the side of the balcony. He laughed, falling and\nsliding along a cloth banner tied between a tower window and a tent below.\nDalinar cursed, leaning forward, worried for the old man—until he spotted\nNohadon glowing. He was a Surgebinder—but Dalinar had known that\nfrom the last vision, hadn’t he?\nDalinar walked back to the writing chamber and drew the Stormlight\nfrom the diamond that Nohadon had been using. He returned, then heaved\nhimself off the balcony, aiming for the cloth Nohadon had used to break his\nfall. Dalinar hit it at an angle and used it like a slide, keeping his right foot\nforward to guide his descent. Near the bottom, he flipped off the banner,\ngrabbing its edge with two hands and hanging there for an instant before\ndropping with a thump beside the king.\nNohadon clapped. “I thought you wouldn’t do it.”\n“I have practice following fools in their reckless pursuits.”\nThe old man grinned, then scanned his list. “This way,” he said, pointing.\n“I can’t believe you’re out shopping by yourself. No guards?”\n“I walked all the way to Urithiru on my own. I think I can manage this.”\n“You didn’t walk all the way to Urithiru,” Dalinar said. “You walked to\none of the Oathgates, then took that to Urithiru.”\n“Misconception!” Nohadon said. “I walked the whole way, though I did\nrequire some help to reach Urithiru’s caverns. That is no more a cheat than\ntaking a ferry across a river.”\nHe bustled through the market and Dalinar followed, distracted by the\ncolorful clothing everyone was wearing. Even the stones of the buildings\nwere painted in vibrant colors. He’d always imagined the past as … dull.\nStatues from ancient times were weathered, and he’d never considered that\nthey might have been painted so brightly.\nWhat of Nohadon himself? In both visions, Dalinar had been shown\nsomeone he did not expect. The young Nohadon, considering war. Now the\nelderly one, glib and whimsical. Where was the deep-thinking philosopher\nwho had written The Way of Kings?\nRemember, Dalinar told himself, this isn’t really him. The person I’m\ntalking to is a construct of the vision.\nThough some people in the market recognized their king, his passing\ndidn’t cause much of a stir. Dalinar spun as he saw something move beyond\nthe buildings, a large shadow that passed between two structures, tall and\nenormous. He stared in that direction, but didn’t see it again.\nThey entered a tent where a merchant was selling exotic grains. The man\nbustled over and hugged Nohadon in a way that should have been improper\nfor a king. Then the two started haggling like scribes; the rings on the\nmerchant’s fingers flashed as he gestured at his wares."

Outside, something made a distant thud. Then another.\nThe ground shook, but nobody reacted.\n“Noh—Your Majesty?” Dalinar asked.\nNohadon ignored him. A shadow passed over the tent. Dalinar ducked,\njudging the form of the shadow, the sounds of crashing footfalls.\n“Your Majesty!” he shouted, fearspren growing up around him. “We’re\nin danger!”\nThe shadow passed, and the footfalls grew distant.\n“Deal,” Nohadon said to the merchant. “And well argued, you swindler.\nMake sure to buy Lani something nice with the extra spheres you got off\nme.”\nThe merchant bellowed a laughing reply. “You think you got the worse\nof that? Storms, Your Majesty. You argue like my grandmother when she\nwants the last spoonful of jam!”\n“Did you see that shadow?” Dalinar asked Nohadon.\n“Have I told you,” Nohadon replied, “where I learned to make Shin loaf\nbread? It wasn’t in Shin Kak Nish, if that’s what you were going to reply.”\n“I…” Dalinar looked in the direction the enormous shadow had gone.\n“No. You haven’t told me.”\n“It was at war,” Nohadon said. “In the west. One of those senseless\nbattles in the years following the Desolation. I don’t even remember what\ncaused it. Someone invaded someone else, and that threatened our trade\nthrough Makabakam. So off we went.\n“Well, I ended up with a scouting group on the edge of the Shin border.\nSo you see, I tricked you just now. I said I wasn’t in Shin Kak Nish, and I\nwasn’t. But I was right next to it.\n“My troops occupied a small village beneath one of the passes. The\nmatron who cooked for us accepted my military occupation without\ncomplaint. She didn’t seem to care which army was in charge. She made me\nbread every day, and I liked it so much, she asked if I wanted to learn…”\nHe trailed off. In front of him, the merchant set weights on one side of\nhis large set of scales—representing the amount Nohadon had purchased—\nthen started pouring grain into a bowl on the other side of the scale. Golden,\ncaptivating grain, like the light of captured flames. “What happened to the\ncook woman?” Dalinar asked.\n“Something very unfair,” Nohadon said. “It’s not a happy story. I\nconsidered putting it into the book, but decided my story would best be\nlimited to my walk to Urithiru.” He fell silent, contemplative.\nHe reminds me of Taravangian, Dalinar suddenly thought. How odd.\n“You are having trouble, my friend,” Nohadon said. “Your life, like that\nof the woman, is unfair.”\n“Being a ruler is a burden, not merely a privilege,” Dalinar said. “You\ntaught me that.

I could best defend the world if\nI could simply make the others do as they should!”\nNohadon nodded. “So why don’t you?”\n“You didn’t.”\n“I tried and failed. That led me to a different path.”\n“You’re wise and thoughtful. I’m a warmonger, Nohadon. I’ve never\naccomplished anything without bloodshed.”\nHe heard them again. The tears of the dead. Evi. The children. Flames\nburning a city. He heard the fire roar in delight at the feast.\nThe merchant ignored them, busy trying to get the grain to balance. The\nweighted side was still heavier. Nohadon set a finger on the bowl with the\ngrain and pushed down, making the sides even. “That will do, my friend.”\n“But—” the merchant said.\n“Give the excess to the children, please.”\n“After all that haggling? You know I’d have donated some if you’d\nasked.”\n“And miss the fun of negotiating?” Nohadon said. He borrowed the\nmerchant’s pen, then crossed an item off his list. “There is satisfaction,” he\nsaid to Dalinar, “in creating a list of things you can actually accomplish,\nthen removing them one at a time. As I said, a simple joy.”\n“Unfortunately, I’m needed for bigger things than shopping.”\n“Isn’t that always the problem? Tell me, my friend. You talk about your\nburdens and the difficulty of the decision. What is the cost of a principle?”\n“The cost? There shouldn’t be a cost to being principled.”\n“Oh? What if making the right decision created a spren who instantly\nblessed you with wealth, prosperity, and unending happiness? What then?\nWould you still have principles? Isn’t a principle about what you give up,\nnot what you gain?”\n“So it’s all negative?” Dalinar said. “Are you implying that nobody\nshould have principles, because there’s no benefit to them?”\n“Hardly,” Nohadon said. “But maybe you shouldn’t be looking for life to\nbe easier because you choose to do something that is right! Personally, I\nthink life is fair. It’s merely that often, you can’t immediately see what\nbalances it.” He wagged the finger he’d used to tip the merchant’s scales.\n“If you’ll forgive a somewhat blatant metaphor. I’ve grown fond of them.\nYou might say I wrote an entire book about them.”\n“This … is different from the other visions,” Dalinar said. “What’s going\non?”\nThe thumping from before returned.

Creatures\napproaching from all sides, shadows in the sun.\n“All things exist in three realms, Dalinar,” Nohadon said. “The Physical:\nwhat you are now. The Cognitive: what you see yourself as being. The\nSpiritual: the perfect you, the person beyond pain, and error, and\nuncertainty.”\nMonsters of stone and horror surrounded him, heads cresting roofs, feet\ncrushing buildings.\n“You’ve said the oaths,” Nohadon called. “But do you understand the\njourney?

But that had been a different kind of danger from\nthe one she faced today.\nToday, her work had implications not only for one nation, but for the\nentire world. She burst into a room deep within the tower, and the four\nlighteyes seated there scrambled to their feet—all but Sebarial, who\nappeared to be flipping through a stack of cards bearing pictures of women\nin compromising positions.\nNavani sighed, then nodded as Aladar gave her a respectful bow, light\nglinting off his bald head. Not for the first time, Navani wondered if his thin\nmustache and the tuft of beard on his bottom lip were compensation for his\nlack of hair. Hatham was there as well: refined, with rounded features and\ngreen eyes. As usual, his fashion choices stood out from everyone else.\nOrange today.\nBrightness Bethab had come representing her husband. The men in the\narmy tended to disrespect him for letting her do so—but that ignored the\nfact that marrying Mishinah for her political acumen had been a wise and\ncalculated move.\nThe five men of Bridge Four arrayed themselves behind Navani. They\nhad been surprised when she’d asked them to escort her; they didn’t yet\nunderstand the authority they lent the throne. The Knights Radiant were the\nnew power in the world, and politics swirled around them like eddies in a\nriver.\n“Brightlords and Brightlady,” Navani said. “I’ve come at your request,\nand am at your service.”\nAladar cleared his throat, sitting. “You know, Brightness, that we are the\nmost loyal to your husband’s cause.”\n“Or at the least,” Sebarial added, “we’re the ones hoping to get rich by\nthrowing in our lot with him.”\n“My husband appreciates the support,” Navani said, “regardless of\nmotive. You create a stronger Alethkar, and therefore a stronger world.”\n“What’s left of either one,” Sebarial noted.\n“Navani,” Brightlady Bethab said. She was a mousy woman with a\npinched face. “We appreciate that you’ve taken the initiative in this difficult\ntime.” There was a glint to her orange eyes, as if she assumed Navani was\nenjoying her new power. “But the highprince’s absence is not advantageous\nfor morale. We know that Dalinar has returned to his … distractions.”\n“The highprince,” Navani said, “is in mourning.”\n“The only thing he seems to be mourning,” Sebarial said, “is the fact that\npeople won’t bring him bottles of wine fast enough for—”\n“Damnation, Turinad!” Navani snapped. “That’s enough!”\nSebarial blinked, then pocketed his cards. “Sorry, Brightness.”\n“My husband,” Navani said, “is still this world’s best chance for\nsurvival. He will push through his pain. Until then, our duty is to keep the\nkingdom running.”\nHatham nodded, beads on his coat glistening. “This is, of course, our\ngoal.

You do\nknow that Dalinar … came to us and asked what we thought of this\nhighking business.”\nThat news wasn’t commonly known yet. They’d planned an official\nannouncement, and even had Elhokar seal the papers before leaving. Yet\nDalinar had delayed. She understood; he wanted to wait until Elhokar and\nAdolin—who would become Kholin highprince in Dalinar’s place—\nreturned.\nAnd yet, as more and more time passed, the questions began to grow\nmore pressing. What had happened to them in Kholinar? Where were they?\nStrength. They would return.\n“The highking proclamation has not been made official,” Navani said. “I\nthink it’s best to pretend you don’t know about it, for now. And whatever\nyou do, don’t mention it to Ialai or Amaram.”\n“Very well,” Aladar said. “But Brightness, we have other problems.\nSurely you’ve seen the reports. Hatham does an excellent job as Highprince\nof Works, but there isn’t proper infrastructure. The tower has plumbing, but\nit keeps getting clogged, and the Soulcasters work themselves to exhaustion\ndealing with the waste.”\n“We can’t continue pretending the tower can accommodate this\npopulation,” Brightness Bethab said. “Not without a very favorable supply\ndeal from Azir. Our emerald reserves, despite hunts on the Shattered Plains,\nare dwindling. Our water carts have to work nonstop.”\n“Equally important, Brightness,” Hatham added, “we might be facing a\nsevere labor shortage. We have soldiers or caravan men filling in hauling\nwater or packing goods, but they don’t like it. Menial carrying is beneath\nthem.”\n“We’re running low on lumber,” Sebarial added. “I’ve tried to claim the\nforests back near the warcamps, but we used to have parshmen to cut them.\nI don’t know if I can afford to pay men to do the work instead. But if we\ndon’t start something, Thanadal might try to seize them. He’s building\nhimself quite the kingdom in the warcamps.”\n“This is not a time,” Hatham said softly, “when we can afford weak\nleadership. It is not a time when a would-be king can spend his days locked\nin his rooms. I’m sorry. We are not in rebellion, but we are very concerned.”\nNavani drew in a breath. Hold it together.\nOrder was the very substance of rule. If things were organized, control\ncould be asserted. She just had to give Dalinar time. Even if, deep down, a\npart of her was angry. Angry that his pain so overshadowed her growing\nfear for Elhokar and Adolin.

He would likely do\nthe same for her someday.\n“Tell us honestly, Brightness,” Sebarial said, leaning forward. “What\ndoes the Blackthorn want? Is this all secretly a way for him to dominate the\nworld?”\nStorms. Even they worried about it. And why shouldn’t they? It made so\nmuch sense.\n“My husband wants unity,” Navani said firmly. “Not dominion. You\nknow as well as I do that we could have seized Thaylen City. That would\nhave led to selfishness and loss. There is no path through conquest to facing\nour enemy together.”\nAladar nodded slowly. “I believe you, and I believe in him.”\n“But how do we survive?” Brightness Bethab said.\n“This tower’s gardens once grew food,” Navani said. “We will figure out\nhow it was done, and we will grow here again. The tower once flowed with\nwater. The baths and lavatories prove that. We will delve into the secrets of\ntheir fabrials, and we will fix the plumbing problems.\n“The tower is above the enemy’s storm, supremely defensible and\nconnected to the most important cities in the world. If there is a nation that\ncan stand against the enemy, we will forge it here. With your help and my\nhusband’s leadership.”\nThey accepted that. Bless the Almighty, they accepted it. She made a\nmental note to burn a glyphward in thanks, then finally took a seat.\nTogether, they delved into the tower’s most recent list of problems, talking\nthrough—as they’d done many times before—the dirty necessities of\nrunning a city.\nThree hours later, she checked her arm fabrial—a mirror of the one\nDalinar carried, with inset clock and newly designed painrials. Three hours\nand twelve minutes since the meeting had begun. Exhaustionspren had\ncollected to swirl around them all, and she called an end. They’d hashed out\ntheir immediate problems, and would summon their various scribes to offer\nspecific revisions.\nThis would keep everyone going a little longer. And, bless them, these\nfour did want the coalition to work. Aladar and Sebarial, for all their flaws,\nhad followed Dalinar into the dark of the Weeping and found Damnation\nwaiting there. Hatham and Bethab had been at the advent of the new storm,\nand could see that Dalinar had been right.\nThey didn’t care that the Blackthorn was a heretic—or even whether he\nusurped the throne of Alethkar. They cared that he had a plan for dealing\nwith the enemy, long-term.\nAfter the meeting broke, Navani walked off down the strata-lined\nhallway, trailed by her bridgeman guards, two of whom carried sapphire\nlanterns. “I do apologize,” she noted to them, “for how boring that must\nhave been.”\n“We like boring, Brightness,” Leyten—their leader today—said. He was\na stocky man, with short, curly hair. “Hey, Hobber. Anyone try to kill you in\nthere?”\nThe gap-toothed bridgeman grinned his reply. “Does Huio’s breath\ncount?”\n“See, Brightness?” Leyten said. “New recruits might get bored by guard\nduty, but you’ll never find a veteran complaining about a nice quiet"

Public intoxication on firemoss. Aladar had quietly requested her seal\nto free him.\nNo, all was not well with them. But as Navani led them down toward the\nbasement library rooms, a different issue gnawed at her: Brightlady\nBethab’s implication that Navani was eager for the chance to take over\nwhile Dalinar was indisposed.\nNavani was not a fool. She knew how it looked to others. She’d married\none king. After he died, she’d immediately gone after the next most\npowerful man in Alethkar. But she couldn’t have people believing she was\nthe power behind the throne. Not only would it undermine Dalinar, but it\nwould grow tedious for her. She had no problem being a wife or mother to\nmonarchs, but to be one herself—storms, what a dark path that would lead\nthem all down.\nShe and the bridgemen passed no fewer than six squads of sentries on\ntheir way to the library rooms with the murals and—more importantly—the\nhidden gemstone records. Arriving, she idled in the doorway, impressed by\nthe operation that Jasnah had organized down here since Navani had been\nforced to step back from the research.\nEach gemstone had been removed from its individual drawer,\ncatalogued, and numbered. While one group listened and wrote, others sat\nat tables, busy translating. The room buzzed with a low hum of discussion\nand scratching reeds, concentrationspren dotting the air like ripples in the\nsky.\nJasnah strolled along the tables, looking through pages of translations.\nAs Navani entered, the bridgemen gathered around Renarin, who blushed,\nlooking up from his own papers, which were covered in glyphs and\nnumbers. He did look out of place in the room, the only man in uniform\nrather than in the robes of an ardent or stormwarden.\n“Mother,” Jasnah said, not looking up from her papers, “we need more\ntranslators. Do you have any other scribes versed in classical Alethelan?”\n“I’ve lent you everyone I have. What is Renarin studying over there?”\n“Hm? Oh, he thinks there might be a pattern to which stones were stored\nin which drawers. He’s been working on it all day.”\n“And?”\n“Nothing, which is not surprising. He insists he can find a pattern if he\nlooks hard enough.” Jasnah lowered her pages and looked at her cousin,\nwho was joking with the men of Bridge Four.\nStorms, Navani thought.

        "text": "looks hard enough.” Jasnah lowered her pages and looked at her cousin,\nwho was joking with the men of Bridge Four.\nStorms, Navani thought. He truly looks happy. Embarrassed as they\nribbed him, but happy. She’d worried when he had first “joined” Bridge\nFour. He was the son of a highprince. Decorum and distance were\nappropriate when dealing with enlisted soldiers.\nBut when, before this, had she last heard him laugh?\n“Maybe,” Navani said, “we should encourage him to take a break and go\nout with the bridgemen for the evening.”\n“I’d rather keep him here,” Jasnah said, flipping through her pages. “His\npowers need additional study.”\nNavani would talk to Renarin anyway and encourage him to go out more\nwith the men. There was no arguing with Jasnah, any more than there was\narguing with a boulder. You just stepped to the side and went around.\n“The translation goes well,” Navani asked, “other than the bottleneck on\nnumbers of scribes?”\n“We’re lucky,” Jasnah said, “that the gemstones were recorded so late in\nthe life of the Radiants. They spoke a language we can translate. If it had\nbeen the Dawnchant…”\n“That’s close to being cracked.”\nJasnah frowned at that. Navani had thought the prospect of translating\nthe Dawnchant—and writings lost to the shadowdays—would have excited\nher. Instead, it seemed to trouble her.\n“Have you found anything more about the tower’s fabrials in these\ngemstone records?” Navani asked.\n“I’ll be certain to prepare a report for you, Mother, with details of each\nand every fabrial mentioned. So far, those references are few. Most are\npersonal histories.”\n“Damnation.”\n“Mother!” Jasnah said, lowering her pages.\n“What? I wouldn’t have thought you would object to a few strong words\nnow and—”\n“It’s not the language, but the dismissal,” Jasnah said. “Histories.”\nOh, right.\n“History is the key to human understanding.”\nHere we go.\n“We must learn from the past and apply that knowledge to our modern\nexperience.”\nLectured by my own daughter again.\n“The best indication of what human beings will do is not what they\nthink, but what the record says similar groups have done in the past.”\n“Of course, Brightness.”\nJasnah gave her a dry look, then set her papers aside. “I’m sorry, Mother.\nI’ve been dealing with a lot of lesser ardents today. My didactic side might\nhave inflated.”\n“You have a didactic side? Dear, you hate teaching.”\n“Which explains my mood, I should think. I—”\nA young scribe called for her from the other side of the room. Jasnah\nsighed, then went to answer the question.\nJasnah preferred to work alone, which was odd, considering how good\nshe was at getting people to do what she wanted. Navani liked groups—but\nof course, Navani wasn’t a scholar. Oh, she knew how to pretend. But all\nshe really did was nudge here and there, perhaps provide an idea. Others did\nall the real engineering.\nShe poked through the papers Jasnah had set aside. Perhaps her daughter\nhad missed something in the translations. To her mind, the only scholarship"

To her mind, the only scholarship\nof importance was stuffy, dusty writings of old philosophers. When it came\nto fabrials, Jasnah barely knew her pairings from her warnings.…\nWhat was this?\nThe glyphs were scrawled in white on the highprince’s wall, the paper\nread. We quickly ascertained the implement of writing to be a stone pried\nfree near the window. This first sign was the roughest of them, the glyphs\nmalformed. The reason for this later became apparent, as Prince Renarin\nwas not versed in writing glyphs, save the numbers.\nThe other pages were similar, talking about the strange numbers found\naround Dalinar’s palace in the days leading up to the Everstorm. They’d\nbeen made by Renarin, whose spren had given him warning that the enemy\nwas preparing an assault. The poor boy, uncertain of his bond and\nfrightened to speak out, had instead written the numbers where Dalinar\nwould see them.\nIt was a little odd, but in the face of everything else, it didn’t really\nregister. And … well, it was Renarin. Why had Jasnah collected all of\nthese?\nI have a description for you, finally, Jasnah, another said. We’ve\nconvinced the Radiant that Lift found in Yeddaw to visit Azimir. Though she\nhas not yet arrived, you can find sketches of her spren companion here. It\nlooks like the shimmer you see on a wall when you shine light through a\ncrystal.\nTroubled, Navani set the sheets down before Jasnah could return. She\ngot a copy of the translated portions from the gemstones—several young\nscribes were assigned to making these available—then slipped out to go\ncheck on Dalinar.\n105. Spirit, Mind, and Body\nSIX YEARS AGO\nOnly the very most important people were allowed to watch Gavilar’s holy\ninterment.\nDalinar stood at the front of the small crowd, gathered in the royal\ncatacombs of Kholinar, beneath the stone sight of kings. Fires burned at the\nsides of the room, a primal light, traditional. Distinctly more alive than the\nlight of spheres, it reminded him of the Rift—but for once, that pain was\noverpowered by something new. A fresh wound.\nThe sight of his brother, lying dead on the slab.\n“Spirit, mind, and body,” the wizened ardent said, her voice echoing in\nthe stone catacomb. “Death is the separation of the three. The body remains\nin our realm, to be reused. The spirit rejoins the pool of divine essence that\ngave it birth. And the mind … the mind goes to the Tranquiline Halls to find\nits reward.”\nDalinar’s nails bit his skin as he clenched his hands into fists—tight, to\nkeep him from trembling.\n“Gavilar the Majestic,” the ardent continued, “first king of Alethkar in\nthe new Kholin Dynasty, thirty-second highprince of the Kholin princedom,\nheir of the Sunmaker and blessed of the Almighty. His accomplishments\nwill be lauded by all, and his dominion extends to the hereafter. Already he"

Already he\nleads men again on the battlefield, serving the Almighty in the true war\nagainst the Voidbringers.”\nThe ardent thrust a bony hand toward the small crowd. “Our king’s war\nhas moved to the Tranquiline Halls. The end of our war for Roshar did not\nend our duty to the Almighty! Think upon your Callings, men and women\nof Alethkar. Think of how you might learn here, and be of use in the next\nworld.”\nJevena would use any available opportunity to preach. Dalinar clenched\nhis hands tighter, angry at her—angry at the Almighty. Dalinar should not\nhave lived to see his brother die. This was not the way it should have gone.\nHe felt eyes on his back. Collected highprinces and wives, important\nardents, Navani, Jasnah, Elhokar, Aesudan, Dalinar’s sons. Nearby,\nHighprince Sebarial glanced at Dalinar, eyebrows raised. He seemed to be\nexpecting something.\nI’m not drunk, you idiot, Dalinar thought. I’m not going to make a scene\nto amuse you.\nThings had been going better lately. Dalinar had started controlling his\nvices; he’d confined his drinking to monthly trips away from Kholinar,\nvisiting outer cities. He said the trips were to let Elhokar practice ruling\nwithout Dalinar looking over his shoulder, as Gavilar had been spending\nmore and more time abroad. But during those trips, Dalinar drank himself to\noblivion, letting himself escape the sounds of children crying for a few\nprecious days.\nThen, when he returned to Kholinar, he controlled his drinking. And he’d\nnever again yelled at his sons, as he had at poor Renarin during that day on\nthe way back from the Shattered Plains. Adolin and Renarin were the only\npure remnant of Evi.\nIf you control your drinking when back in Kholinar, a part of him\nchallenged, what happened at the feast? Where were you when Gavilar was\nfighting for his life?\n“We must use King Gavilar as a model for our own lives,” the ardent\nwas saying. “We must remember that our lives are not our own. This world\nis but the skirmish to prepare us for the true war.”\n“And after that?” Dalinar asked, looking up from Gavilar’s corpse.\nThe ardent squinted, adjusting her spectacles. “Highprince Dalinar?”\n“After that, what?” Dalinar said. “After we win back the Tranquiline\nHalls? What then? No more war?”\nIs that when we finally get to rest?\n“You needn’t worry, Blackthorn,” Jevena said. “Once that war is won,\nthe Almighty will certainly provide for you another conquest.” She smiled\ncomfortingly, then moved on to the ritual sayings. A series of keteks, some\ntraditional, others composed by female family members for the event.\nArdents burned the poems as prayers in braziers.\nDalinar looked back down at his brother’s corpse, which stared upward,\nlifeless blue marbles replacing his eyes."

There is something strange\nupon the winds.\nDalinar needed something to drink, storm it.\n“You, always about dreams. My soul weeps. Farewell, weeping soul. My\ndreams … about, always, You.”\nThe poem slapped him harder than the others. He sought out Navani, and\nknew instantly that the ketek had been hers. Gazing straight ahead, she\nstood with one hand on Elhokar’s—King Elhokar’s—shoulder. So beautiful.\nNext to her, Jasnah stood with arms wrapped around herself, eyes red.\nNavani reached toward her, but Jasnah pulled away from the others and\nstalked off toward the palace proper.\nDalinar wished he could do the same, but instead drew himself to\nattention. It was over. He’d never have a chance to live up to Gavilar’s\nexpectations. Dalinar would live the rest of his life as a failure to this man\nwhom he had loved so dearly.\nThe hall grew still, quiet save for the crinkling sound of paper burning in\nthe fires. The Soulcaster stood up, and old Jevena stepped hastily backward.\nShe wasn’t comfortable with what was coming next. None of them were,\njudging by the shuffling feet, the coughs into hands.\nThe Soulcaster might have been male, might have been female. Hard to\nsay, with that hood up over their face. The skin beneath was colored like\ngranite, cracked and chipped, and seemed to glow from within. The\nSoulcaster regarded the corpse, head cocked, as if surprised to find a body\nhere. They ran their fingers along Gavilar’s jaw, then brushed the hair off\nhis forehead.\n“The only part of you that is true,” the Soulcaster whispered, tapping a\nstone that had replaced one of the king’s eyes. Then, light emerged as the\nSoulcaster drew their hand from their pocket, revealing a set of gemstones\nbound into a fabrial.\nDalinar didn’t look away, despite how the light made his eyes water. He\nwished … he wished he’d taken a drink or two before coming. Was he\nreally supposed to watch something like this while sober?\nThe Soulcaster touched Gavilar on the forehead, and the transformation\nhappened instantly. One moment Gavilar was there. The next he had\nbecome a statue.\nThe Soulcaster slipped a glove onto their hand while other ardents\nhurried to remove the wires that had held Gavilar’s body in position. They\nused levers to tip him carefully forward until he was standing, holding a\nsword with point toward the ground, his other hand outstretched. He stared\ntoward eternity, crown on his head, the curls of his beard and hair preserved\ndelicately in the stone. A powerful pose; the mortuary sculptors had done a\nfantastic job.\nThe ardents pushed him back into an alcove, where he joined the lines of\nother monarchs—most of them highprinces of the Kholin princedom. He\nwould be forever frozen here, the image of a perfect ruler in his prime."

He\nwould be forever frozen here, the image of a perfect ruler in his prime.\nNobody would think of him as he’d been that terrible night, broken from his\nfall, his grand dreams cut short by treason.\n“I’ll have vengeance, Mother,” Elhokar whispered. “I’ll have it!” The\nyoung king spun toward the gathered lighteyes, standing before his father’s\noutstretched stone hand. “You’ve each come to me privately to give\nsupport. Well, I demand you swear it in public! Today, we make a pact to\nhunt those who did this. Today, Alethkar goes to war!”\nHe was greeted by stunned silence.\n“I swear it,” Torol Sadeas said. “I swear to bring vengeance to the\ntraitorous parshmen, Your Majesty. You can depend upon my sword.”\nGood, Dalinar thought, as others spoke up. This would hold them\ntogether. Even in death, Gavilar provided an excuse for unity.\nUnable to stand that stone visage any longer, Dalinar left, stomping into\nthe corridor toward the palace proper. Other voices echoed after him as\nhighprinces swore.\nIf Elhokar was going to chase those Parshendi back toward the plains,\nhe’d expect the Blackthorn’s help. But … Dalinar hadn’t been that man for\nyears. He patted his pocket, looking for his flask. Damnation. He pretended\nhe was better these days, kept telling himself he was in the process of\nfinding a way out of this mess. Of returning to the man he’d once been.\nBut that man had been a monster. Frightening, that nobody had blamed\nhim for the things he’d done. Nobody but Evi, who had seen what the\nkilling would do to him. He closed his eyes, hearing her tears.\n“Father?” a voice said from behind.\nDalinar forced himself to stand upright, turning as Adolin scrambled up\nto him.\n“Are you well, Father?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “I just … need to be alone.”\nAdolin nodded. Almighty above, the boy had turned out well, through\nlittle effort of Dalinar’s. Adolin was earnest, likable, and a master of the\nsword. He was truly capable in modern Alethi society, where how you\nmoved among groups was even more important than strength of arm.\nDalinar had always felt like a tree stump in those kinds of settings. Too big.\nToo stupid.\n“Go back,” Dalinar said. “Swear for our house on this Vengeance Pact.”\nAdolin nodded, and Dalinar continued onward, fleeing those fires below.\nGavilar’s stare, judging him. The cries of people dying in the Rift.\nBy the time he reached the steps, he was practically running. He climbed\none level, then another. Sweating, frantic, he raced through ornate hallways\npast carved walls, sedate woods, and accusatory mirrors. He reached his\nchambers and scrabbled in his pockets for the keys. He’d locked the place\ntight; no more would Gavilar sneak in to take his bottles. Bliss waited\ninside.\nNo. Not bliss. Oblivion. Good enough.\nHis hands wouldn’t stop shaking. He couldn’t— It—\nFollow the Codes tonight."

All of you, get out!\nIn the distance, a voice …\n“You must find the most important words a man can say.”\nWhich key was it? He got one into the lock, but it wouldn’t turn. He\ncouldn’t see. He blinked, feeling dizzy.\n“Those words came to me from one who claimed to have seen the\nfuture,” the voice said, echoing in the hallway. Feminine, familiar. “ ‘How\nis this possible?’ I asked in return. ‘Have you been touched by the void?’\n“The reply was laughter. ‘No, sweet king. The past is the future, and as\neach man has lived, so must you.’\n“ ‘So I can but repeat what has been done before?’\n“ ‘In some things, yes. You will love. You will hurt. You will dream. And\nyou will die. Each man’s past is your future.’\n“ ‘Then what is the point?’ I asked. ‘If all has been seen and done?’\n“ ‘The question,’ she replied, ‘is not whether you will love, hurt, dream,\nand die. It is what you will love, why you will hurt, when you will dream,\nand how you will die. This is your choice. You cannot pick the destination,\nonly the path.’ ”\nDalinar dropped the keys again, sobbing. There was no escape. He\nwould fall again. Wine would consume him like a fire consumed a corpse.\nLeaving only ash.\nThere was no way out.\n“This started my journey,” the voice said. “And this begins my writings.\nI cannot call this book a story, for it fails at its most fundamental to be a\nstory. It is not one narrative, but many. And though it has a beginning, here\non this page, my quest can never truly end.\n“I wasn’t seeking answers. I felt that I had those already. Plenty, in\nmultitude, from a thousand different sources. I wasn’t seeking ‘myself.’\nThis is a platitude that people have ascribed to me, and I find the phrase\nlacks meaning.\n“In truth, by leaving, I was seeking only one thing.\n“A journey.”\nFor years, it seemed that Dalinar had been seeing everything around him\nthrough a haze. But those words … something about them …\nCould words give off light?\nHe turned from his door and walked down the corridor, searching for the\nsource of the voice. Inside the royal reading room, he found Jasnah with a\nhuge tome set before her at a standing table. She read to herself, turning to\nthe next page, scowling.\n“What is that book?” Dalinar asked.\nJasnah started. She wiped her eyes, smearing the makeup, leaving her\neyes … clean, but raw. Holes in a mask.\n“This is where my father got that quote,” she said. “The one he…”\nThe one he wrote as he died.\nOnly a few knew of that.\n“What book is it?”\n“An old text,” Jasnah said. “Ancient, once well regarded.

But\nwhat?”\nDalinar settled down into one of the seats. He felt as if he had no\nstrength. “Will you read it to me?”\nJasnah met his eyes, chewing her lip as she’d always done as a child.\nThen she read in a clear, strong voice, starting over from the first page,\nwhich he’d just heard. He had expected her to stop after a chapter or two,\nbut she didn’t, and he didn’t want her to.\nDalinar listened, rapt. People came to check on them; some brought\nJasnah water to drink. For once, he didn’t ask them for anything. All he\nwanted was to listen.\nHe understood the words, but at the same time he seemed to be missing\nwhat the book said. It was a sequence of vignettes about a king who left his\npalace to go on a pilgrimage. Dalinar couldn’t define, even to himself, what\nhe found so striking about the tales. Was it their optimism? Was it the talk\nof paths and choices?\nIt was so unpretentious. So different from the boasts of society or the\nbattlefield. Just a series of stories, their morals ambiguous. It took almost\neight hours to finish, but Jasnah never gave any indication she wanted to\nstop. When she read the last word, Dalinar found himself weeping again.\nJasnah dabbed at her own eyes. She had always been so much stronger than\nhe was, but here they shared an understanding. This was their send-off to\nGavilar’s soul. This was their farewell.\nLeaving the book on the lectern, Jasnah walked over to Dalinar as he\nstood up. They embraced, saying nothing. After a few moments, she left.\nHe went to the book, touching it, feeling the lines of the writing stamped\ninto its cover. He didn’t know how long he’d been standing there when\nAdolin peeked in. “Father? We’re planning to send expeditionary forces to\nthe Shattered Plains. Your input would be appreciated.”\n“I must,” Dalinar whispered, “go on a journey.”\n“Yeah,” Adolin said. “It’s a long way. Might get some hunts in while\nwe’re on our way, if there’s time. Elhokar wants these barbarians wiped out\nquickly. We could be gone and back in a year.”\nPaths. Dalinar could not choose his end.\nBut perhaps his path …\nThe Old Magic can change a person, Evi had said. Make something\ngreat of them.\nDalinar stood up taller. He turned and stepped toward Adolin, seizing\nhim by the shoulder. “I’ve been a poor father these last few years,” Dalinar\nsaid.\n“Nonsense,” Adolin said. “You—”\n“I’ve been a poor father,” Dalinar repeated, raising his finger. “To you\nand your brother both.

Gloryspren\nsprang up around him.\n“We will go to war together,” Dalinar said. “Like we did when you were\nyoung. I will show you what it is to be a man of honor. But first, I need to\ntake an advance force—without you, I’m afraid—and secure the Shattered\nPlains.”\n“We talked about that,” Adolin said, eager. “Like your elites, from\nbefore. Fast, quick!

I’ll move in toward the Shattered Plains with my\nforce and secure the region, preparing for the rest of you to arrive.”\n“That would be a sound idea, I guess,” Adolin said.\nIt was sound. Sound enough that when one of Dalinar’s ships was\ndelayed—and Dalinar himself remained in port, sending most of his force\non without him—nobody would think it strange. Dalinar did get himself\ninto trouble.\nHe would swear his men and sailors to secrecy, and travel a few months\nout of his way before continuing on to the Shattered Plains.\nEvi had said the Old Magic could transform a man. It was about time he\nstarted trusting her.\n106. Law Is Light\nI find Ba-Ado-Mishram to be the most interesting of the Unmade. She\nis said to have been keen of mind, a highprincess among the enemy\nforces, their commander during some of the Desolations. I do not know\nhow this relates to the ancient god of the enemy, named Odium.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 224\nSzeth of Shinovar flew with the Skybreakers for three days, southward.\nThey stopped several times to recover hidden stockpiles in mountain\npeaks or remote valleys. To find doorways, they often had to hack through\nfive inches of crem. That amount of buildup had probably taken centuries to\naccumulate, yet Nin spoke of the places as if he’d just left. At one, he was\nsurprised to find the food long since decayed—though fortunately, the\ngemstone stockpile there had been hidden in a place where it remained\nexposed to the storms.\nIn these visits, Szeth finally began to grasp how ancient this creature\nwas.\nOn the fourth day, they reached Marat. Szeth had been to the kingdom\nbefore; he had visited most of Roshar during the years of his exile.\nHistorically, Marat wasn’t truly a nation—but neither was it a place of\nnomads, like the backwaters of Hexi and Tu Fallia. Instead, Marat was a\ngroup of loosely connected cities, tribally run, with a highprince at their\nhead—though in the local dialect, he was called “elder brother.”\nThe country made for a convenient waystop between the Vorin kingdoms\nof the east and the Makabaki ones of the center west.

Szeth knew that Marat\nwas rich in culture, full of people as proud as you’d find in any nation—but\nof almost no value on the political scale.\nWhich made it curious that Nin chose to end their flight here. They\nlanded on a plain full of strange brown grass that reminded Szeth of wheat,\nsave for the fact that this pulled down into burrows, leaving visible only the\nsmall bob of grain on the top. This was casually eaten by wild beasts that\nwere wide and flat, like walking discs, with claws only on the underside to\nshove the grain into their mouths.\nThe disclike animals would probably migrate eastward, their droppings\ncontaining seeds that—stuck to the ground—would survive storms to grow\ninto first-stage polyps. Those would later blow to the west and become\nsecond-stage grain. All life worked in concert, he’d been taught in his\nyouth. Everything but men, who refused their place. Who destroyed instead\nof added.\nNin spoke briefly with Ki and the other masters, who took to the air\nagain. The others joined them—all but Szeth and Nin himself—and\nstreaked toward a town in the distance. Before Szeth could follow, Nin took\nhim by the arm and shook his head. Together, the two of them flew to a\nsmaller town on a hill near the coast.\nSzeth knew the effects of war when he saw them. Broken doors, ruins of\na short, breached wall. The destruction looked recent, though any bodies\nhad been cleaned out and the blood had been washed away by highstorms.\nThey landed before a large stone building with a peaked roof. Mighty doors\nof Soulcast bronze lay broken off in the rubble. Szeth would be surprised if\nsomebody didn’t return to claim those for their metal. Not every army had\naccess to Soulcasters.\nAw, the sword said from his back. We missed the fun?\n“That tyrant in Tukar,” Szeth said, looking through the silent town. “He\ndecided to end his war against Emul, and expand eastward?”\n“No,” Nin said. “This is a different danger.” He pointed toward the\nbuilding with the broken doors. “Can you read that writing above the\ndoorway, Szeth-son-Neturo?”\n“It’s in the local language. I don’t know the script, aboshi.” The divine\nhonorific was his best guess of how to address one of the Heralds, though\namong his people it had been reserved for the great spren of the mountains.\n“It says ‘justice,’ ” Nin said. “This was a courthouse.”\nSzeth followed the Herald up the steps and into the cavernous main room\nof the ruined courthouse. In here, sheltered from the storm, they found\nblood on the floor. No bodies, but plenty of discarded weapons, helms, and\n—disturbingly—the meager possessions of civilians. The people had likely\ntaken refuge inside here during the battle, a last grasp at safety.\n“The ones you call parshmen name themselves the singers,” Nin said.\n“They took this town and pressed the survivors into labor at some docks\nfarther along the coast. Was what happened here justice, Szeth-son-\nNeturo?”\n“How could it be?” He shivered. The dark reaches of the room seemed to"

The dark reaches of the room seemed to\nbe filled with haunted whispers. He drew closer to the Herald for safety.\n“Ordinary people, living ordinary lives, suddenly attacked and murdered?”\n“A poor argument. What if the lord of this city had stopped paying his\ntaxes, then forced his people to defend the city when higher authorities\narrived and attacked? Is not a prince justified in maintaining order in his\nlands? Sometimes, it is just to kill ordinary people.”\n“But that did not happen here,” Szeth said. “You said this was caused by\nan invading army.”\n“Yes,” Nin said softly. “This is the fault of invaders. That is true.” He\ncontinued walking through the hollow room, Szeth staying close behind\nhim. “You are in a unique position, Szeth-son-Neturo. You will be the first\nto swear the oaths of a Skybreaker in a new world, a world where I have\nfailed.”\nThey found steps near the back wall. Szeth got out a sphere for light, as\nNin did not appear to be so inclined. That drove the whispers back.\n“I visited Ishar,” Nin continued. “You call him Ishu-son-God. He has\nalways been the most wise of us. I did not … want to believe … what had\nhappened.”\nSzeth nodded. He had seen that. After the first Everstorm, Nin had\ninsisted that the Voidbringers hadn’t returned. He had given excuse after\nexcuse, until eventually he’d been forced to admit what he was seeing.\n“I worked for thousands of years to prevent another Desolation,” Nin\ncontinued. “Ishar warned me of the danger. Now that Honor is dead, other\nRadiants might upset the balance of the Oathpact. Might undermine\ncertain … measures we took, and give an opening to the enemy.”\nHe stopped at the top of the steps and looked down at his hand, where a\nglistening Shardblade appeared. One of the two missing Honorblades.\nSzeth’s people had care of eight. Once, long ago, it had been nine. Then this\none had vanished.\nHe’d seen depictions of it, strikingly straight and unornamented for a\nShardblade, yet still elegant. Two slits ran the length of the weapon, gaps\nthat could never exist in an ordinary sword, as they would weaken it.\nThey walked along a loft at the top of the courtroom. Records storage,\njudging by the scattered ledgers on the floor.\nYou should draw me, the sword said.\n“And do what, sword-nimi?” Szeth whispered.\nFight him. I think he might be evil.\n“He is one of the Heralds—one of the least-evil things in the world.”\nHuh. Doesn’t bode well for your world, then. Anyway, I’m better than\nthat sword he has. I can show you.\nPicking his way past the legal debris, Szeth joined Nin beside the loft’s\nwindow. In the distance, farther along the coast, a large bay glistened with\nblue water. Many masts of ships gathered there, figures buzzing around\nthem.\n“I have failed,” Nin repeated. “And now, for the people, justice must be"

A very difficult justice, Szeth-son-Neturo. Even for my Skybreakers.”\n“We will endeavor to be as passionless and logical as you, aboshi.”\nNin laughed. It didn’t seem to carry the mirth that it should have. “Me?\nNo, Szeth-son-Neturo. I am hardly passionless. This is the problem.” He\npaused, staring out the window at the distant ships. “I am … different from\nhow I once was. Worse, perhaps? Despite all that, a part of me wishes to be\nmerciful.”\n“And is … mercy such a bad thing, aboshi?”\n“Not bad; merely chaotic. If you look through the records in this hall,\nyou will find the same story told again and again. Leniency and mercy. Men\nset free despite crimes, because they were good fathers, or well-liked in the\ncommunity, or in the favor of someone important.\n“Some of those who are set free change their lives and go on to produce\nfor society. Others recidivate and create great tragedies. The thing is, Szeth-\nson-Neturo, we humans are terrible at spotting which will be which. The\npurpose of the law is so we do not have to choose. So our native\nsentimentality will not harm us.”\nHe looked down again at his sword.\n“You,” he said to Szeth, “must choose a Third Ideal. Most Skybreakers\nchoose to swear themselves to the law—and follow with exactness the laws\nof whatever lands they visit. That is a good option, but not the only one.\nThink wisely, and choose.”\n“Yes, aboshi,” Szeth said.\n“There are things you must see, and things you must know, before you\ncan speak. The others must interpret what they have sworn before, and I\nhope they will see the truth. You will be the first of a new order of\nSkybreakers.” He looked back out the window. “The singers allowed the\npeople of this town to return here to burn their dead. A kinder gesture than\nmost conquerors would allow.”\n“Aboshi … may I ask you a question?”\n“Law is light, and darkness does not serve it. Ask, and I will answer.”\n“I know you are great, ancient, and wise,” Szeth said. “But … to my\nlesser eyes, you do not seem to obey your own precepts. You hunted\nSurgebinders, as you said.”\n“I obtained legal permission for the executions I performed.”\n“Yes,” Szeth said, “but you ignored many lawbreakers to pursue these\nfew. You had motives beyond the law, aboshi. You were not impartial. You\nbrutally enforced specific laws to achieve your ends.”\n“This is true.”\n“So is this just your own … sentimentality?”\n“In part. Though I have certain leniencies. The others have told you of\nthe Fifth Ideal?”\n“The Ideal where the Skybreaker becomes the law?”\nNin held out his empty left hand.

The First Step\nThere is very little information about Ba-Ado-Mishram in more\nmodern times. I can only assume she, unlike many of them, returned to\nDamnation or was destroyed during Aharietiam.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 226\nDalinar found a washbasin ready for him in the morning. Navani\nmeticulously kept it filled, just as she cleaned up the bottles and allowed the\nservants to bring him more. She trusted him better than he trusted himself.\nStretching in his bed, Dalinar woke feeling far too … whole, considering\nthe drinking he’d been doing. Indirect sunlight illuminated the room from\nthe window. Normally they kept the shutters in this room closed to ward off\nthe cold mountain air. Navani must have opened them after rising.\nDalinar splashed his face with water from the basin, then caught a hint of\nhis own scent. Right. He looked into one of the connecting rooms, which\nthey’d appropriated for a washroom, as it had a back entrance the servants\ncould use. Sure enough, Navani had ordered the tub filled for him. The\nwater was cold, but he’d known his share of cold baths. It would keep him\nfrom lingering.\nA short time later, he took a razor to his face, peering at himself in a\nbedroom mirror. Gavilar had taught him to shave. Their father had been too\nbusy getting himself cut apart in foolish duels of honor, including the one\nwhere he’d taken a blow to the head. He’d never been right after that.\nBeards were unfashionable in Alethkar these days, but that wasn’t why\nDalinar shaved. He liked the ritual. The chance to prepare, to cut away the\nnightly chaff and reveal the real person underneath—furrows, scars, and\nharsh features included.\nA clean uniform and underclothes waited for him on a bench. He\ndressed, then checked the uniform in the mirror, pulling down on the\nbottom of the coat to tighten any folds.\nThat memory of Gavilar’s funeral … so vivid. He’d forgotten parts. Had\nthat been the Nightwatcher, or the natural course of memories? The more he\nrecovered of what he had lost, the more he realized that the memories of\nmen were flawed. He’d mention an event now fresh to his mind, and others\nwho had lived it would argue over details, as each recalled it differently.\nMost, Navani included, seemed to remember him as more noble than he\ndeserved. Yet he didn’t ascribe any magic to this. It was simply the way of\nhuman beings, subtly changing the past in their minds to match their current\nbeliefs.\nBut then … that vision with Nohadon. Where had that come from? Just a\ncommon dream?"

Just a\ncommon dream?\nHesitant, he reached out to the Stormfather, who rumbled distantly. “Still\nthere, I see,” Dalinar said, relieved.\nWhere would I go?\n“I hurt you,” Dalinar said. “When I activated the Oathgate. I was afraid\nyou would leave me.”\nThis is the lot I have chosen. It is you or oblivion.\n“I’m sorry, regardless, for what I did. Were you … involved in that\ndream I had? The one with Nohadon?”\nI know of no such dream.\n“It was vivid,” Dalinar said. “More surreal than one of the visions, true,\nbut captivating.”\nWhat was the most important step a man could take? The first,\nobviously. But what did it mean?\nHe still bore the weight of what he had done at the Rift. This recovery—\nthis stepping away from the week spent drinking—wasn’t a redemption.\nWhat would he do if he felt the Thrill again? What would happen the next\ntime the weeping in his mind became too difficult to bear?\nDalinar didn’t know. He felt better today. Functional. For now, he would\nlet that be enough. He picked a piece of lint off his collar, then belted on a\nside sword and stepped out of the bedroom, walking through his study and\ninto the larger room with the hearth.\n“Taravangian?” he said, surprised to find the elderly king seated there.\n“Wasn’t there to be a meeting of the monarchs today?” He vaguely\nremembered Navani telling him of it early that morning.\n“They said I wasn’t needed.”\n“Nonsense! We’re all needed at the meetings.” Dalinar paused. “I’ve\nmissed several, haven’t I? Well, regardless, what are they talking about\ntoday?”\n“Tactics.”\nDalinar felt his face go red. “The deployment of troops and the defense\nof Jah Keved, your kingdom?”\n“I think they believe that I will give up the throne of Jah Keved, once a\nsuitable local man has been found.” He smiled. “Do not be so outraged on\nmy behalf, my friend. They didn’t forbid me; they simply noted I wasn’t\nneeded. I wanted some time to think, so I came here.”\n“Still. Let’s go up, shall we?”\nTaravangian nodded, standing. He wobbled on unsteady legs and Dalinar\nhurried over to help him. Stabilized, Taravangian patted Dalinar’s hand.\n“Thank you. You know, I’ve always felt old. But lately, it seems my body is\ndetermined to give me persistent reminders.”\n“Let me summon a palanquin to carry you.”\n“No, please. If I give up walking, I fear my deterioration will increase.\nI’ve seen similar things happen to people in my hospitals.” But he held\nDalinar’s arm as they walked toward the doorway. Outside, Dalinar\ncollected some guards of his own along with Taravangian’s large Thaylen\nbodyguard. They started toward the lifts.\n“Do you know,” Dalinar said, “if there’s word…”"

No news\nof Adolin, Elhokar, or the Radiants. But had he been of sound enough mind\nto listen?\n“I’m sorry, Dalinar,” Taravangian said. “So far as I know, we haven’t had\na message from them. But we must keep hope, of course! They might have\nlost their spanreed, or gotten trapped in the city.”\nI … may have felt something, the Stormfather said. During a recent\nhighstorm, it felt like Stormblessed was there with me. I do not know what it\nmeans, for I cannot see him—or the others—anywhere. I presumed them\ndead, but now … now I find myself believing. Why?\n“You have hope,” Dalinar whispered, smiling.\n“Dalinar?” Taravangian asked.\n“Just whispering to myself, Your Majesty.”\n“If I might say … You seem stronger today. You’ve decided something?”\n“More, I’ve remembered something.”\n“Is it something you can share with a worried old man?”\n“Not yet. I’ll try to explain once I have it figured out myself.”\nAfter an extended trip up the lifts, Dalinar led Taravangian into a quiet,\nwindowless chamber on the penultimate floor of the tower. They’d dubbed\nit the Gallery of Maps, after a similar location in the warcamps.\nAladar led the meeting, standing beside a table that was covered by a\nlarge map of Alethkar and Jah Keved. The dark-skinned Alethi man wore\nhis war uniform—the mix of a traditional takama skirt and modern jacket\nthat had been catching on among his officers. His bodyguard, Mintez, stood\nbehind him in full Shardplate—Aladar preferred not to use the Shards\npersonally. He was a general, not a warrior. He nodded to Dalinar and\nTaravangian when they entered.\nIalai sat nearby, and studied Dalinar, saying nothing. He’d almost have\nwelcomed a wisecrack; in the old days, she’d been quick to joke with him.\nHer silence now didn’t mean she was being respectful. It meant she was\nsaving her barbs to whisper where he couldn’t hear.\nHighprince Ruthar—thick-armed and wearing a full beard—sat with\nIalai. He’d opposed Dalinar from the start. The other Alethi highprince who\nhad come today was Hatham, a long-necked man with light orange eyes. He\nwore a red and gold uniform of a type that Dalinar hadn’t seen before, with\na short jacket that buttoned only at the top. Silly-looking, but what did\nDalinar know of fashion? The man was extremely polite, and he ran a tight\narmy.\nQueen Fen had brought the Thaylen high admiral, a scrawny old man\nwith mustaches that drooped almost to the table.

Dalinar saluted back.\nThat boy would make an excellent officer, if he could learn to keep his\ntemper.\nThe Azish emperor wasn’t there, nor was their little Edgedancer. Instead,\nAzir had sent a collection of scholars. Azish “generals” tended to be of the\narmchair type, military historians and theorists who spent their days in\nbooks. Dalinar was certain they had men with practical knowledge in their\nmilitary, but those rarely ended up promoted. So long as you failed certain\ntests, you could remain in the field and command.\nDalinar had met the two Veden highprinces during his trip to their city.\nThe brothers were tall, prim men with short black hair and uniforms much\nlike those of the Alethi. Taravangian had appointed them after their\npredecessors had been poisoned, following the civil war. Jah Keved\nobviously still had many problems.\n“Dalinar?” Aladar said. He stood up straighter, then saluted. “Brightlord,\nyou’re looking better.”\nStorms. How much did the rest of them know?\n“I’ve spent some time in meditation,” Dalinar said. “I see you’ve been\nbusy. Tell me about the defensive array.”\n“Well,” Aladar said, “we—”\n“That’s it?” Queen Fen interrupted. “What in Damnation was wrong\nwith you? You ran all around Vedenar like a wildman, then locked yourself\nin your room for a week!”\n“I was excommunicated from the Vorin church soon after hearing of\nKholinar’s fall. I took it poorly. Did you expect me to react by throwing a\nfeast?”\n“I expected you to lead us, not sulk.”\nI deserved that. “You are right. You can’t have a commander who refuses\nto command. I’m sorry.”\nThe Azish whispered among themselves, looking surprised at the\nbluntness of the exchange. But Fen settled back and Aladar nodded.\nDalinar’s mistakes had needed to be aired.\nAladar began explaining their battle preparations. The Azish generals—\nall wearing robes and Western hats—crowded around, offering commentary\nthrough translators. Dalinar used a little Stormlight and touched one on the\narm, to gain access to their language for a short time. He found their advice\nsurprisingly astute, considering that they were basically a committee of\nscribes.\nThey’d moved ten battalions of Alethi troops through the Oathgates,\nalong with five battalions of Azish. That put fifteen thousand men on the\nground in Jah Keved, including some of their most loyal Kholin and Aladar\nforces.\nThat seriously cut into his troop numbers. Storms, they’d lost so many at\nNarak—the companies that Dalinar had remaining at Urithiru were mostly\nrecruits or men from other princedoms who had asked to join his military.\nSebarial, for example, had cut back to maintaining only a single division,\ngiving Dalinar the rest to wear Kholin colors.\nDalinar had interrupted a discussion of how to fortify the Jah Keved\nborder.

He offered some insights, but mostly listened as they explained their\nplans: stockpiles here, garrisons there. They hoped the Windrunners would\nbe able to scout for them.\nDalinar nodded, but found that something bothered him about this battle\nplan. A problem he couldn’t define. They’d done well; their lines of supply\nhad been drawn realistically and their scout posts were spaced for excellent\ncoverage.\nWhat, then, was wrong?\nThe door opened, revealing Navani, who froze when she saw Dalinar,\nthen melted into a relieved smile. He nodded to her, as one of the Veden\nhighprinces explained why they shouldn’t abandon the backwater strip of\nland running east of the Horneater Peaks. Aladar had been ready to cede it\nand use the Peaks as a barrier.\n“It’s not only about the opportunity to levy troops from His Majesty’s\nHorneater subjects, Brightlord,” the highprince—Nan Urian—explained in\nAlethi. “These lands are lush and well appointed, buffered from storms by\nthe very Alethi highlands you’ve been speaking of. We’ve always fought\ndesperately for them against invasions, because they will succor those who\nseize them—and provide staging areas for assaults on the rest of Jah\nKeved!”\nDalinar grunted. Navani stepped over to where most of them stood\naround the table map, so he reached out and put his arm around her waist.\n“He’s right, Aladar. I spent a long time skirmishing on that very border.\nThat area is more important strategically than it first appears.”\n“Holding it is going to be tough,” Aladar said. “We’ll get mired in an\nextended battle for that ground.”\n“Which is what we want, isn’t it?” the Veden highprince said. “The\nlonger we stall the invasion, the more time it will give my Veden brethren to\nrecover.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “Yes…” It was easy to get mired in battles along\nthat vast Veden front. How many years had he spent fighting false bandits\nthere? “Let’s take a break. I want to consider this.”\nThe others seemed to welcome the opportunity. Many stepped into the\nlarger chamber outside, where attendants with spanreeds waited to relay\ninformation. Navani stayed beside Dalinar as he surveyed the map. “It’s\ngood to see you up,” she whispered.\n“You’re more patient than I deserve. You should have dumped me out of\nbed and poured the wine on my head.”\n“I had a feeling you’d push through.”\n“I have for now,” he said. “In the past, a few days—or even weeks—of\nsobriety didn’t mean much.”\n“You’re not the man you were back then.”\nOh, Navani. I never grew beyond that man; I just hid him away. He\ncouldn’t explain that to her yet. Instead, he whispered thanks into her ear,\nand rested his hand on hers. How could he ever have been frustrated at her\nadvances?\nFor now, he turned his attention to the maps, and lost himself in them:\nthe fortresses, the storm bunkers, the cities, the drawn-in supply lines."

At the wine table, he\nforced himself to pour a warm, spiced orange. Something with no kick.\nJasnah joined the group, delivering a stack of papers to her mother.\n“May I see?” Ialai asked.\n“No,” Jasnah replied; Dalinar hid a smile in his drink.\n“What secrets are you keeping?” Ialai asked. “What happened to your\nuncle’s grand talk of unification?”\n“I suspect that each monarch in this room,” Jasnah said, “would prefer to\nknow that state secrets are allowed to remain their own.

We will release what we\ndiscover, once we are certain that our translations are correct and that\nnothing in these notes might give our enemies an advantage against this\ncity.” Jasnah cocked an eyebrow. “Or would you prefer our scholarship be\nsloppy?”\nThe Azish seemed mollified by this.\n“I just think,” Ialai said, “you showing up here with them is a slap in the\nface for the rest of us.”\n“Ialai,” Jasnah said, “it is good you are here. Sometimes, an intelligent\ndissenting voice tests and proves a theory. I do wish you’d work harder on\nthe intelligent part.”\nDalinar downed the rest of his drink and smiled as Ialai settled back in\nher chair, wisely not escalating a verbal battle against Jasnah.\nUnfortunately, Ruthar did not have similar sense.\n“Don’t mind her, Ialai,” he said, mustache wet with wine. “The godless\nhave no concept of proper decency. Everyone knows that the only reason to\nabandon belief in the Almighty is so that you can explore vice.”\nOh, Ruthar, Dalinar thought. You can’t win this fight. Jasnah has thought"

It’s a familiar battleground to her—\nStorms, that was it.\n“They aren’t going to attack Jah Keved!” Dalinar shouted, interrupting\nJasnah’s rebuttal.\nThose in the room turned to him, surprised, Jasnah’s mouth half open.\n“Dalinar?” Highprince Aladar asked. “We decided that Jah Keved was\nthe most likely—”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “No, we know the terrain too well! The Alethi and\nthe Vedens have spent generations fighting over that land.”\n“What, then?” Jasnah asked.\nDalinar ran back into the map room. The others flooded in around him.\n“They went to Marat, right?” Dalinar asked. “They cut through Emul and\ninto Marat, silencing spanreeds nationwide. Why? Why go there?”\n“Azir was too well fortified,” Aladar said. “From Marat, the Voidbringers\ncan strike at Jah Keved from both the west and the east.”\n“Through the bottleneck in Triax?” Dalinar asked. “We talk of Jah\nKeved’s weakness, but that’s relative. They still have a huge standing army,\nstrong fortifications. If the enemy wades into Jah Keved now, while\nsolidifying their own power, it will drain their resources and stall their\nconquest. That isn’t what they want right now, when they still have the\nupper hand in momentum.”\n“Where, then?” Nan Urian asked.\n“A place that was hit hardest of all by the new storms,” Dalinar said,\npointing at the map. “A place whose military might was severely\nundermined by the Everstorm. A place with an Oathgate.”\nQueen Fen gasped, safehand going to her lips.\n“Thaylen City?” Navani asked. “Are you sure?”\n“If the enemy takes Thaylen City,” Dalinar said, “they can blockade Jah\nKeved, Kharbranth, and what few lands in Alethkar we still own. They can\nseize command of the entire Southern Depths and launch naval assaults on\nTashikk and Shinovar. They could swarm New Natanan and have a position\nfrom which to assault the Shattered Plains. Strategically, Thaylen City is far\nmore important than Jah Keved—but at the same time, far worse\ndefended.”\n“But they’d need ships,” Aladar said.\n“The parshmen took our fleet.…” Fen said.\n“After that first terrible storm,” Dalinar said, “how were there any ships\nleft for them to take?”\nFen frowned. “As I think about it, that’s remarkable, isn’t it? There were\ndozens remaining, as if the winds left them alone. Because the enemy\nneeded them…”\nStorms. “I’ve been thinking too much like an Alethi,” Dalinar said.\n“Boots on stone. But the enemy moved into Marat immediately, a perfect\nposition from which to launch at Thaylen City.”\n“We need to revise our plans!” Fen said.\n“Peace, Your Majesty,” Aladar said. “We have armies in Thaylen City"

Good Alethi troops. Nobody is better on the ground than Alethi\ninfantry.”\n“We have three divisions there right now,” Dalinar said. “We’ll want at\nleast three more.”\n“Sir,” Fen’s son said. “Brightlord. That’s not enough.”\nDalinar glanced at Fen. Her wizened admiral nodded.\n“Speak,” Dalinar said.\n“Sir,” the youth said, “we’re glad to have your troops on the island.\nKelek’s breath! If you’re going to get into a fight, you definitely want the\nAlethi on your side. But an enemy fleet is a much larger problem than\nyou’re assuming—one you can’t easily fix by moving troops around. If the\nenemy ships find Thaylen City well defended, they’ll just sail on and attack\nKharbranth, or Dumadari, or any number of defenseless cities along the\ncoast.”\nDalinar grunted. He did think too much like an Alethi. “What, then?”\n“We need our own fleet, obviously,” Fen’s admiral said. He had a thick\naccent of mushed syllables, like a mouth full of moss. “But most of our\nships were lost to the blustering Everstorm. Half were abroad, caught\nunaware. My colleagues now dance upon the bottom of the depths.”\n“And the rest of your fleet was stolen,” Dalinar said with a grunt. “What\nelse do we have?”\n“His Majesty Taravangian has ships at our port,” the Veden highprince\nsaid.\nAll eyes turned toward Taravangian. “Merchant ships only,” the old man\nsaid. “Vessels that carried my healers. We haven’t a true navy, but I did\nbring twenty ships. I could perhaps provide ten more from Kharbranth.”\n“The storm took a number of our ships,” the Veden highprince said, “but\nthe civil war was more devastating. We lost hundreds of sailors. We have\nmore ships than we have crew for right now.”\nFen joined Dalinar beside the map. “We might be able to scrape together\na semblance of a navy to intercept the enemy, but the fighting will be on the\ndecks of ships. We’ll need troops.”\n“You’ll have them,” Dalinar said.\n“Alethi who’ve never seen a rough sea in their lives?” Fen asked,\nskeptical. She looked to the Azish generals. “Tashikk has a navy, doesn’t it?\nStaffed and supplemented by Azish troops.”\nThe generals conferred in their own language. Finally, one spoke through\nan interpreter. “The Thirteenth Battalion, Red and Gold, has men who do a\nrotation on ships and patrol the grand waterway. Getting others here would\ntake much time, but the thirteenth is already stationed in Jah Keved.”\n“We’ll supplement them with some of my best men,” Dalinar said.\nStorms, we need those Windrunners active. “Fen, would your admirals\npresent a suggested course for the gathering and deployment of a unified\nfleet?”\n“Sure,” the short woman said. She leaned in, speaking under her breath."

Many of my sailors follow the Passions. You’re going to have\nto do something about these claims of heresy, Blackthorn. Already there’s\ntalk among my people that this is—at long last—the right time for the\nThaylens to break free from the Vorin church.”\n“I won’t recant,” Dalinar said.\n“Even if it causes a wholesale religious collapse in the middle of a war?”\nHe didn’t reply, and she let him withdraw from the table, thinking about\nother plans. He spoke with the others about various items, thanked Navani\n—again—for holding everything together. Then eventually, he decided to\ngo back down below and take a few reports from his stewards.\nOn his way out, he passed Taravangian, who had taken a seat by the\nwall. The old man looked distracted by something.\n“Taravangian?” Dalinar said. “We’ll leave troops in Jah Keved too, in\ncase I’m wrong. Don’t worry.”\nThe old man looked to Dalinar, then strangely wiped tears from his eyes.\n“Are … are you in pain?” Dalinar asked.\n“Yes. But it is nothing you can fix.” He hesitated. “You are a good man,\nDalinar Kholin. I did not expect that.”\nAshamed by that, Dalinar hurried from the room, followed by his guards.\nHe felt tired, which seemed unfair, considering he’d just spent a week\nbasically sleeping.\nBefore seeking his stewards, Dalinar stopped on the fourth floor from the\nbottom. An extended walk from the lifts took him to the outer wall of the\ntower, where a small series of rooms smelled of incense. People lined the\nhallways, waiting for glyphwards or to speak with an ardent. More than\nhe’d expected—but then, they didn’t have much else to do, did they?\nIs that how you think of them already? a part of him asked. Only here to\nseek spiritual welfare because they don’t have anything better to do?\nDalinar kept his chin high, resisting the urge to shrink before their stares.\nHe passed several ardents and stepped into a room lit and warmed by\nbraziers, where he asked after Kadash.\nHe was directed onto a garden balcony, where a small group of ardents\nwas trying to farm. Some placed seed paste while others were trying to get\nsome shalebark starters to take along the wall. An impressive project, and\none he didn’t remember ordering them to begin.\nKadash was quietly chipping crem off a planter box. Dalinar settled\ndown beside him. The scarred ardent glanced at him and kept working.\n“It’s very late coming,” Dalinar said, “but I wanted to apologize to you\nfor Rathalas.”\n“I don’t think I’m the one you need to apologize to,” Kadash said.\n“Those who could bear an apology are now in the Tranquiline Halls.”\n“Still, I made you part of something terrible.”\n“I chose to be in your army,” Kadash said. “I’ve found peace with what\nwe did—found it among the ardents, where I no longer shed the blood of\nmen. I suppose it would be foolish of me to suggest the same to you.”"

I suppose it would be foolish of me to suggest the same to you.”\nDalinar took a deep breath. “I’m releasing you, and the other ardents,\nfrom my control. I won’t put you in a position where you have to serve a\nheretic. I’ll give you to Taravangian, who remains orthodox.”\n“No.”\n“I don’t believe you have the option to—”\n“Just listen for one storming moment, Dalinar,” Kadash snapped, then he\nsighed, forcibly calming himself. “You assume that because you’re a\nheretic, we don’t want anything to do with you.”\n“You proved that a few weeks ago, when we dueled.”\n“We don’t want to normalize what you’ve done or what you’re saying.\nThat doesn’t mean we will abandon our posts. Your people need us, Dalinar,\neven if you believe you don’t.”\nDalinar walked to the edge of the garden, where he rested his hands on\nthe stone railing. Beyond him, clouds mustered at the base of the peaks, like\na phalanx protecting its commander. From up here, it looked like the entire\nworld was nothing more than an ocean of white broken by sharp peaks. His\nbreath puffed in front of him. Cold as the Frostlands, though it didn’t seem\nas bad inside the tower.\n“Are any of those plants growing?” he asked softly.\n“No,” Kadash said from behind. “We aren’t sure if it’s the cold, or the\nfact that few storms reach this high.” He kept scraping. “What will it feel\nlike when a storm goes high enough to engulf this entire tower?”\n“Like we’re surrounded by dark confusion,” Dalinar said. “The only\nlight coming in flashes we can’t pinpoint or comprehend. Angry winds\ntrying to tow us in a dozen different directions, or barring that, rip our limbs\nfrom our bodies.” He looked toward Kadash. “Like always.”\n“The Almighty was a constant light.”\n“And?”\n“And now you make us question. You make me question. Being an\nardent is the only thing that lets me sleep at night, Dalinar. You want to take\nthat from me too? If He’s gone, there’s only the storm.”\n“I think there must be something beyond. I asked you before, what did\nworship look like before Vorinism? What did—”\n“Dalinar. Please. Just … stop.” Kadash drew in a deep breath. “Release a\nstatement. Don’t let everyone keep whispering about how you went into\nhiding. Say something pedantic like, ‘I’m pleased with the work the Vorin\nchurch does, and support my ardents, even if I myself no longer have the\nfaith I once did.’ Give us permission to move on. Storms, this isn’t the time\nfor confusion. We don’t even know what we’re fighting.…”\nKadash didn’t want to know that Dalinar had met the thing they were\nfighting. Best not to speak of that.\nBut Kadash’s question did leave him considering. Odium wouldn’t be\ncommanding the day-to-day operations of his army, would he? Who did\nthat? The Fused?

The Voidspren?\nDalinar strolled a short distance from Kadash, then looked toward the\nsky. “Stormfather?” he asked. “Do the enemy forces have a king or a\nhighprince? Maybe a head ardent? Someone other than Odium?”\nThe Stormfather rumbled. Again, I do not see as much as you think I do.\nI am the passing storm, the winds of the tempest. All of this is me. But I am\nnot all of it, any more than you control each breath that leaves your mouth.\nDalinar sighed. It had been worth the thought.\nThere is one I have been watching, the Stormfather added. I can see her,\nwhen I don’t see others.\n“A leader?” Dalinar asked.\nMaybe. Men, both human and singer, are strange in what or whom they\nrevere. Why do you ask?\nDalinar had decided not to bring anyone else into one of the visions\nbecause he worried about what Odium would do to them. But that wouldn’t\ncount for people already serving Odium, would it?\n“When is the next highstorm?”\n* * *\nTaravangian felt old.\nHis age was more than the aches that no longer faded as the day\nproceeded. It was more than the weak muscles, which still surprised him\nwhen he tried to lift an object that should have seemed light.\nIt was more than finding that he’d slept through yet another meeting,\ndespite his best efforts to pay attention. It was even more than slowly seeing\nalmost everyone he’d grown up with fade away and die.\nIt was the urgency of knowing that tasks he started today, he wouldn’t\nfinish.\nHe stopped in the hallway back to his rooms, hand resting on the strata-\nlined wall. It was beautiful, mesmerizing, but he only found himself\nwishing for his gardens in Kharbranth. Other men and women got to live\nout their waning hours in comfort, or at least familiarity.\nHe let Mrall take him by the arm and guide him to his rooms. Normally,\nTaravangian would have been bothered by the help; he did not like being\ntreated like an invalid. Today though … well, today he would suffer the\nindignity. It was a lesser one than collapsing in the hallway.\nInside the room, Adrotagia sat amid six different scribbling spanreeds,\nbuying and trading information like a merchant at market. She looked at\nhim, but knew him well enough not to comment on his exhausted face or\nslow steps. Today was a good day, of average intelligence. Perhaps a little\non the stupid side, but he’d take that.\nHe seemed to be having fewer and fewer intelligent days. And the ones\nhe did have frightened him.\nTaravangian settled down in a plush, comfortable seat, and Maben went\nto get him some tea.\n“Well?” Adrotagia asked. She’d grown old too, with enormous bags\naround her green eyes, the persistent kind formed by drooping skin. She had\nliver spots and wispy hair. No man would look at her and see the\nmischievous child she’d once been. The trouble the two of them had gotten\ninto …\n“Vargo?” Adrotagia asked."

But please,\ngive me time to consider. My mind is slow today. Have you reports?”\nAdrotagia flipped over a paper from one of her stacks. “Moelach seems\nto have settled in the Horneater Peaks. Joshor is on his way there now. We\nmight again soon have access to the Death Rattles.”\n“Very well.”\n“We’ve found what happened to Graves,” Adrotagia continued.\n“Scavengers found the storm-blown wreckage of his wagon, and there was\nan intact spanreed inside.”\n“Graves is replaceable.”\n“And the Shards?”\n“Irrelevant,” Taravangian said. “We won’t win the prize through force of\narms. I was reluctant to let him try his little coup in the first place.”\nHe and Graves had disagreed about the Diagram’s instructions: to kill\nDalinar or recruit him? And who was to be king of Alethkar?\nWell, Taravangian had been wrong about the Diagram himself many\ntimes. So he’d allowed Graves to move forward with his own plots,\naccording to his own readings of the Diagram. While the man’s schemes\nhad failed, so had Taravangian’s attempt to have Dalinar executed. So\nperhaps neither of them had read the Diagram correctly.\nHe took some time to recover, frustrated that he should need to recover\nfrom a simple walk. A few minutes later, the guard admitted Malata. The\nRadiant wore her usual skirt and leggings, Thaylen style, with thick boots.\nShe took a seat across from Taravangian at the low table, then sighed in a\nmelodramatic way. “This place is awful. Every last idiot here is frozen, ears\nto toes.”\nHad she been this confident before bonding a spren? Taravangian hadn’t\nknown her well then. Oh, he’d managed the project, full of eager recruits\nfrom the Diagram, but the individuals hadn’t mattered to him. Until now.\n“Your spren,” Adrotagia asked, getting out a sheet of paper. “Has she\nanything to report?”\n“No,” Malata said. “Only the tidbit from earlier, about other visions\nDalinar hasn’t shared with everyone.”\n“And,” Taravangian asked, “has the spren expressed any …\nreservations? About the work you’ve given her?”\n“Damnation,” Malata said, rolling her eyes. “You’re as bad as Kholin’s\nscribes. Always poking.”\n“We need to be cautious, Malata,” Taravangian said. “We can’t be certain\nwhat your spren will do as her self-awareness grows. She will surely dislike\nworking against the other orders.”\n“You’re as frozen as the lot of them,” Malata said. She started glowing,\nStormlight rising from her skin. She reached forward, whipping off her\nglove—safehand no less—and pressing it against the table."

The scent of burning filled the air, but the\nflames didn’t persist if she didn’t will them to.\nThe swirls and lines extended across the tabletop, a masterwork of\nengraving accomplished in moments. Malata blew off the ash. The Surge\nshe used, Division, caused objects to degrade, burn, or turn to dust.\nIt also worked on people.\n“Spark is fine with what we’re doing,” Malata said, pressing her finger\ndown and adding another swirl to the table. “I told you, the rest of them are\nidiots. They assume all the spren are going to be on their side. Never mind\nwhat the Radiants did to Spark’s friends, never mind that organized\ndevotion to Honor is what killed hundreds of ashspren in the first place.”\n“And Odium?” Taravangian asked, curious. The Diagram warned that\nthe personalities of the Radiants would introduce great uncertainty to their\nplans.\n“Spark is game for whatever it takes to get vengeance. And what lets her\nbreak stuff.” Malata grinned. “Someone should have warned me how fun\nthis would be. I’d have tried way harder to land the job.”\n“What we do is not fun,” Taravangian said. “It is necessary, but it is\nhorrible. In a better world, Graves would have been right. We would be\nallies to Dalinar Kholin.”\n“You’re too fond of the Blackthorn, Vargo,” Adrotagia warned. “It will\ncloud your mind.”\n“No. But I do wish I hadn’t gotten to know him. That will make this\ndifficult.” Taravangian leaned forward, holding his warm drink. Boiled ingo\ntea, with mint. Smells of home. With a start, he realized … he’d probably\nnever live in that home again, would he? He’d thought perhaps he would\nreturn in a few years.\nHe wouldn’t be alive in a few years.\n“Adro,” he continued, “Dalinar’s recovery convinces me we must take\nmore drastic action. Are the secrets ready?”\n“Almost,” she said, moving some other papers. “My scholars in Jah\nKeved have translated the passages we need, and we have the information\nfrom Malata’s spying. But we need some way to disseminate the\ninformation without compromising ourselves.”\n“Assign it to Dova,” Taravangian said. “Have her write a scathing,\nanonymous essay, then leak it to Tashikk. Leak the translations from the\nDawnchant the same day. I want it all to strike at once.” He set aside the\ntea. Suddenly, scents of Kharbranth made him hurt. “It would have been so,\nso much better for Dalinar to have died by the assassin’s blade. For now we\nmust leave him to the enemy’s desires, and that will not be as kind as a\nquick death.”\n“Will it be enough?” Malata asked. “That old axehound is tough.”\n“It will be enough.

You poor, poor man.\n108. Honor’s Path\nChemoarish, the Dustmother, has some of the most varied lore\nsurrounding her. The wealth of it makes sorting lies from truths\nextremely difficult. I do believe she is not the Nightwatcher, contrary to\nwhat some stories claim.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 231\nShallan sketched in her notepad as she stood on the deck of the honorspren\nship, the wind of its passing ruffling her hair. Next to her, Kaladin rested his\narms on the ship’s railing, overlooking the ocean of beads.\nTheir current vessel, Honor’s Path, was faster than Ico’s merchant ship.\nIt had mandras rigged not only at the front, but also to winglike rails jutting\nfrom the sides. It had five decks—including three below for crew and\nstorage—but those were mostly empty. It felt like a war vessel intended to\ncarry troops, but which didn’t currently have a full complement.\nThe main deck was similar to the top deck of human ships, but this craft\nalso had a high deck running down its center from prow to stern. Narrower\nthan the main deck, it was supported by broad white pillars, and probably\noffered an excellent view. Shallan could no more than guess, as only the\ncrew was allowed up there.\nAt least they’d been let out—Shallan and the others had spent their first\nweek on board locked in the hold. The honorspren had given no explanation\nwhen, finally, the humans and Pattern had been released and allowed to\nmove on deck, so long as they stayed off the high deck and did not make\nnuisances of themselves.\nSyl remained imprisoned.\n“Look here.” Shallan tipped her sketched map toward Kaladin. “Pattern\nsays there’s an honorspren stronghold near Kharbranth in our world. They\ncall it Unyielding Fidelity. We’ve got to be heading there. We went\nsouthwest after leaving Celebrant.”\n“While we were in the hold,” Kaladin said softly, “I saw a sea of tiny\nflames through the porthole. A town on our side?”\n“That was here,” Shallan said, pointing at her map. “See where the rivers\nmeet, just southwest of the lake? There are towns there, on our side. The\nriver peninsulas should have blocked our way, but the spren seem to have\ncut a canal through the stone. We wove east around the Icingway River,\nthen swung west again.”\n“So you’re saying…”\nShe pointed at a spot with her charcoal pencil. “We’re right about here,\nheading toward Kharbranth across the Frostlands.”\nKaladin rubbed his chin. He glanced toward an honorspren passing\nabove, and narrowed his eyes. He’d spent their first day of freedom arguing\nwith the honorspren—which had ended with him locked up for another two\ndays.\n“Kaladin…” Shallan said."

Or do you think we\nshould still be trying for Azure’s phantom ‘perpendicularity’ in the\nHorneater Peaks?”\n“I…” He spoke with such authority, such a compelling sense of motion.\n“I don’t know, Kaladin.”\n“We’re heading in the right direction,” he said, firm. “I saw it, Shallan.\nWe just need to continue with the ship a few more days, then find a way to\nescape. We can hike to the Oathgate on this side, and you can transfer us to\nThaylen City.”\nIt sounded reasonable. Well, except for the fact that the honorspren were\nwatching them. And the fact that the Fused knew where they were now, and\nwere probably gathering forces to give chase. And the fact that they had to\nsomehow escape from a ship in the middle of a sea of beads, reach the\nshore, then hike two hundred miles to reach Thaylen City.\nAll of that could fade before Kaladin’s passion. All but the worry that\ntopped them all—could she even make the Oathgate work? She couldn’t\nhelp feeling that too much of this plan depended on her.\nYet those eyes …\n“We could try a mutiny,” Veil said. “Maybe those mistspren who do all\nthe work will listen. They can’t be happy, always hopping about, following\nhonorspren orders.”\n“I don’t know,” Kaladin said, voice hushing as one of these spren—made\nentirely of mist, save for the hands and face—walked past. “Could be\nreckless. I can’t fight them all.”\n“What if you had Stormlight?” Veil asked. “If I could pinch it back for\nyou? What then?”\nHe rubbed at his chin again. Storms, he looked good with a beard. All\nragged and untamed through the face, contrasted by his sharp blue uniform.\nLike a wild spren of passion, trapped by the oaths and codes …\nWait.\nWait, had that been Veil?\nShallan shook free of the momentary drifting of personality. Kaladin\ndidn’t seem to notice.\n“Maybe,” he said. “You really think you can steal the gemstones back for\nus? I’d feel a lot more comfortable with some Stormlight in my pocket.”\n“I…” Shallan swallowed. “Kaladin, I don’t know if … Maybe it would\nbe best not to fight them. They’re honorspren.”"

They’re honorspren.”\n“They’re jailers,” he said, but then calmed. “But they are taking us the\nright direction, if only inadvertently. What if we stole back our Stormlight,\nthen simply jumped off the ship? Can you find a bead to make us a passage\ntoward land, like you did at Kholinar?”\n“I … guess I could try. But wouldn’t the honorspren simply swing\naround and pick us up again?”\n“I’ll think about that,” Kaladin said. “Try and find some beads that we\ncan use.” He walked across the deck, passing by Pattern—who stood with\nhands clasped behind his back, thinking number-filled thoughts. Kaladin\neventually settled beside Azure, speaking softly with her, probably outlining\ntheir plan.\nSuch that it was.\nShallan tucked her sketchpad under her arm and looked over the side of\nthe ship. So many beads, so many souls, piled on top of each other. Kaladin\nwanted her to search through all of that for something helpful?\nShe glanced toward a passing sailor, a mistspren who had gaseous limbs\nthat ended in gloved hands. Her feminine face was the shape of a porcelain\nmask, and she—like the others of her kind—wore a vest and trousers that\nseemed to float on a body made of swirling, indistinct fog.\n“Is there a way for me to get some of those beads?” Shallan asked.\nThe mistspren stopped in place.\n“Please?” Shallan asked. “I—”\nThe sailor jogged off, and then returned a short time later with the\ncaptain: a tall, imperious-looking honorspren named Notum. He glowed a\nsoft blue-white, and wore an outdated—but sharp—naval uniform, which\nwas part of his substance. His beard was of a cut she hadn’t seen before,\nwith the chin shaved, almost like a Horneater, but with a thin mustache and\na sculpted line of hair that ran from it up his cheeks and blended into his\nsideburns.\n“You have a request?” he asked her.\n“I would like some beads, Captain,” Shallan said. “To practice my art, if\nyou please. I need to do something to pass the time on this trip.”\n“Manifesting random souls is dangerous, Lightweaver. I would not have\nyou doing it wantonly upon my decks.”\nKeeping the true nature of her order from him had proven impossible,\nconsidering how Pattern followed her around.\n“I promise not to manifest anything,” she said. “I merely want to practice\nvisualizing the souls inside the beads. It’s part of my training.”\nHe studied her, clasping his hands behind his back. “Very well,” he said\n—which surprised her. She hadn’t expected that to work. He gave an order,\nhowever, and a mistspren lowered a bucket on a rope to get her some beads.\n“Thank you,” Shallan said.\n“It was a simple request,” the captain said. “Just be careful. I suppose\nyou’d need Stormlight to manifest anyway, but still … be careful.”\n“What happens if we carry the beads away too far?” Shallan asked,"

I suppose\nyou’d need Stormlight to manifest anyway, but still … be careful.”\n“What happens if we carry the beads away too far?” Shallan asked,\ncurious as the mistspren handed her the bucket. “They are tied to objects in\nthe Physical Realm, right?”\n“You can carry them anywhere in Shadesmar you wish,” the captain\nsaid. “Their tie is through the Spiritual Realm, and distance doesn’t matter.\nHowever, drop them—let them free—and they’ll work their way back to the\ngeneral location of their physical counterpart.” He eyed her. “You are very\nnew to all of this. When did it begin again? Radiants, swearing Ideals?”\n“Well…”\nHer mother’s dead face, eyes burned.\n“It hasn’t been going on for long,” Shallan said. “A few months for most\nof us. A few years for some…”\n“We had hoped this day would never come.” He turned to march toward\nthe high deck.\n“Captain?” Shallan asked. “Why did you let us out? If you’re so worried\nabout Radiants, why not just keep us locked away?”\n“It wasn’t honorable,” the captain said. “You are not prisoners.”\n“What are we, then?”\n“Stormfather only knows. Fortunately, I don’t have to sort it out. We’ll\ndeliver you and the Ancient Daughter to someone with more authority. Until\nthen, please try not to break my ship.”\n* * *\nAs days passed, Shallan fell into a routine on the honorspren ship. She spent\nmost days sitting on the main deck, near the wale. They let her have beads\nin plenitude to play with, but most of them were useless things. Rocks,\nsticks, bits of clothing. Still, it was useful to visualize them. Hold them,\nmeditate on them. Understand them?\nObjects had desires. Simple desires, true, but they could adhere to those\ndesires with passion—as she’d learned during her few attempts at\nSoulcasting. Now, she didn’t try to change those desires. She just learned to\ntouch them, and to listen.\nShe felt a familiarity to some of the beads. A growing understanding that,\nperhaps, she could make their souls blossom from beads into full-fledged\nobjects on this side. Manifestations, they were called.\nBetween practices with the beads, she did sketches. Some worked, some\ndidn’t. She wore the skirt that Adolin had purchased for her, hoping it\nwould make her feel more like Shallan. Veil kept poking through, which\ncould be useful—but the way it just kind of happened was frightening to\nher. This was the opposite of what Wit had told her to do, wasn’t it?\nKaladin spent the days pacing the main deck, glaring at honorspren he\npassed. He looked like a caged beast. Shallan felt some of his same urgency.\nThey hadn’t seen any sign of the enemy, not since that day in Celebrant. But\nshe slept uneasily each night, worried that she’d wake to calls of an enemy\nship approaching them. Notum had confirmed that the Voidspren were\ncreating their own empire in Shadesmar.

And they controlled Cultivation’s\nPerpendicularity, the easiest way to get between realms.\nShallan sorted through another handful of beads, feeling the impression\nof a small dagger, a rock, a piece of fruit that had started to see itself as\nsomething new—something that could grow into its own identity, rather\nthan merely a part of the whole.\nWhat would someone see when looking at her soul? Would it give a\nsingle, unified impression? Many different ideas of what it was to be her?\nNearby, the ship’s first mate—an honorspren woman with short hair and\nan angular face—left the hold. Curiously, she was carrying Azure’s\nShardblade. She stepped onto the main deck, beneath the shadow of the\nhigh deck, and went hiking toward Azure, who stood watching the ocean\npass nearby.\nCurious, Shallan pocketed the bead representing a knife—just in case—\nthen left the bucket on top of her sketchbook and walked over. Nearby,\nKaladin was pacing again, and he also noticed the sword.\n“Draw her carefully,” Azure said to Borea, the first mate, as Shallan\napproached. “Don’t pull her out all the way—she doesn’t know you.”\nBorea wore a uniform like the captain’s, all stiff and no-nonsense. She\nundid a small latch on the Shardblade, eased it from its sheath a half inch,\nthen drew in a sharp breath. “It … tingles.”\n“She’s investigating you,” Azure said.\n“It really is as you say,” Borea said. “A Shardblade that requires no spren\n—no enslavement. This is something else. How did you do it?”\n“I will trade knowledge, per our deal, once we arrive.”\nBorea snapped the Blade closed. “A good bond, human. We accept your\noffer.” Surprisingly, the woman held the weapon toward Azure, who took it.\nShallan stepped closer, watching as Borea walked off toward the steps up\nto the high deck.\n“How?” Shallan asked as Azure belted on the sword. “You got them to\ngive your weapon back?”\n“They’re quite reasonable,” Azure said, “so long as you make the right\npromises. I’ve negotiated for passage and an exchange of information, once\nwe reach Lasting Integrity.”\n“You’ve done what?” Kaladin said. He stalked over. “What did I just\nhear?”\n“I’ve made a deal, Stormblessed,” Azure said, meeting his gaze. “I’ll be\nfree, once we reach their stronghold.”\n“We’re not going to reach their stronghold,” Kaladin said softly. “We’re\ngoing to escape.”\n“I’m not your soldier, or even Adolin’s subject. I’m going to do what\ngets me to the perpendicularity—and, barring that, I’m going to find out\nwhat these people know about the criminal I’m hunting.”\n“You’d throw away honor for a bounty?”\n“I’m only here because you two—through no fault of your own, I admit\n—trapped me. I don’t blame you, but I’m also not indebted to your\nmission.”\n“Traitor,” he said softly.\nAzure gave him a flat look. “At some point, Kal, you need to admit that\nthe best thing you can do right now is go with these spren.

At their\nstronghold, you could clear up this misunderstanding, then move on.”\n“That could take weeks.”\n“I wasn’t aware we were on a schedule.”\n“Dalinar is in danger. Don’t you care?”\n“About a man I don’t know?” Azure said. “In danger from a threat you\ncan’t define, happening at a time you can’t pinpoint?” She folded her arms.\n“Forgive me for not sharing in your anxiety.”\nKaladin set his jaw, then turned and stalked away—right up the steps\ntoward the high deck. They weren’t supposed to go up there, but sometimes\nrules didn’t seem to apply to Kaladin Stormblessed.\nAzure shook her head, then turned and gripped the ship railing.\n“He’s just having a bad day, Azure,” Shallan said. “I think he feels\nanxious because his spren is imprisoned.”\n“Maybe. I’ve seen a lot of young hotheads in my time, and young\nStormblessed feels like another color altogether. I wish I knew what it was\nhe was so desperate to prove.”\nShallan nodded, then glanced again at Azure’s sword. “You said … the\nhonorspren have information on your bounty?”\n“Yeah. Borea thinks the weapon I’m chasing passed through their\nfortress a few years ago.”\n“Your bounty is a … weapon?”\n“And the one who brought it to your land. A Shardblade that bleeds\nblack smoke.” Azure turned toward her. “I don’t mean to be callous,\nShallan. I realize you’re all eager to return to your lands. I can even believe\nthat—through some tide of Fortune—Kaladin Stormblessed has foreseen\nsome danger.”\nShallan shivered. Be wary of anyone who claims to be able to see the\nfuture.\n“But,” Azure continued, “even if his mission is critical, it doesn’t mean\nmine isn’t as well.”\nShallan glanced toward the high deck, where she could faintly hear\nKaladin making a disturbance. Azure turned and clasped her hands,\nadopting a far-off look. She seemed to want to be alone, so Shallan trailed\nback toward where she’d left her things. She settled down and removed the\nbucket from her sketchpad. The pages fluttered, showing various versions of\nherself, each one wrong. She kept drawing Veil’s face on Radiant’s body, or\nvice versa.\nShe started back into her latest bucket of beads. She found a shirt and a\nbowl, but the next bead was a fallen tree branch. This brought up memories\nof the last time she’d dipped into Shadesmar—freezing, near death, on the\nbanks of the ocean.\nWhy … why hadn’t she tried to Soulcast since then? She’d made\nexcuses, avoided thinking about it. Had focused all her attention on\nLightweaving.\nShe’d ignored Soulcasting. Because she’d failed.\nBecause she was afraid. Could she invent someone who wasn’t afraid?\nSomeone new, since Veil was broken, and had been since that failure in the\nKholinar market …"

How long had she been sitting there? “I’m fine,” she\nsaid. “Just … remembering.”\n“Good things or bad?”\n“All memories are bad,” she said immediately, then looked away,\nblushing.\nHe settled down next to her. Storms, his overt concern was annoying.\nShe didn’t want him worrying about her.\n“Shallan?” he asked.\n“Shallan will be fine,” she said. “I’ll bring her back in a moment. I just\nhave to recover … her…”\nAdolin glanced at the fluttering pages with the different versions of her.\nHe reached out and hugged her, saying nothing. Which turned out to be the\nright thing to say.\nShe closed her eyes and tried to pull herself together. “Which one do you\nlike the most?” she finally asked. “Veil is the one who wears the white\noutfit, but I’m having trouble with her right now. She peeks out sometimes\nwhen I don’t want, but then won’t come when I need her. Radiant is the one\nwho practices with the sword. I made her prettier than the others, and you\ncan talk to her about dueling. But some of the time, I’ll have to be someone\nwho can Lightweave. I’m trying to think of who she should be.…”\n“Ash’s eyes, Shallan!”\n“Shallan’s broken, so I think I’m trying to hide her. Like a cracked vase,\nwhere you turn the nice side toward the room, hiding the flaw. I’m not\ndoing it on purpose, but it’s happening, and I don’t know how to stop it.”\nHe held her.\n“No advice?” she asked, numb. “Everyone always seems to have loads.”\n“You’re the smart one. What can I say?”\n“It’s confusing, being all these people. I feel like I’m presenting different\nfaces all the time. Lying to everyone, because I’m different inside. I … That\ndoesn’t make sense, does it?” She squeezed her eyes shut again. “I’ll pull it\nback together. I’ll be … someone.”\n“I…” He pulled her tight again as the ship rocked. “Shallan, I killed\nSadeas.”\nShe blinked, then pulled back and looked him in the eyes. “What?”\n“I killed Sadeas,” Adolin whispered. “We met in the corridors of the\ntower. He started insulting Father, talking about the terrible things he was\ngoing to do to us. And … and I couldn’t listen anymore. Couldn’t stand\nthere and look at his smug red face. So … I attacked him.”\n“So all that time we were hunting a killer…”\n“It was me. I’m the one the spren copied the first time. I kept thinking\nabout how I was lying to you, to Father, and to everyone. The honorable\nAdolin Kholin, the consummate duelist. A murderer.

His betrayal\ncaused the deaths of many of my friends. When I formally challenged him\nto a duel, he wiggled out of it. He was smarter than me. Smarter than\nFather. He’d have won eventually. So I killed him.”\nHe pulled her to him and took a deep breath.\nShallan shivered, then whispered, “Good for you.”\n“Shallan! You’re a Radiant. You’re not supposed to condone something\nlike this!”\n“I don’t know what I’m supposed to do. I only know that the world is a\nbetter place for the death of Torol Sadeas.”\n“Father wouldn’t like it, if he knew.”\n“Your father is a great man,” Shallan said, “who is, perhaps, better off\nnot knowing everything. For his own good.”\nAdolin breathed in again. With her head pressed to his chest, the air\nmoving in and out of his lungs was audible, and his voice was different.\nMore resonant. “Yeah,” he said. “Yeah, maybe. In any case, I think I know\nwhat it’s like to feel like you’re lying to the world. So maybe if you figure\nout what to do, you could tell me?”\nShe leaned into him, listening to his heartbeat, his breathing. She felt his\nwarmth.\n“You never did say,” she whispered, “which one you prefer.”\n“It’s obvious. I prefer the real you.”\n“Which one is that, though?”\n“She’s the one I’m talking to right now. You don’t have to hide, Shallan.\nYou don’t have to push it down. Maybe the vase is cracked, but that only\nmeans it can show what’s inside. And I like what’s inside.”\nSo warm. Comfortable. And strikingly unfamiliar. What was this peace?\nThis place without fear?\nNoises from above spoiled it. Pulling back, she looked toward the upper\ndeck. “What is the bridgeboy doing up there?”\n* * *\n“Sir,” the misty sailor spren said in broken Alethi. “Sir! Not. Please, not!”\nKaladin ignored her, looking through the spyglass he’d taken from the\nchain nearby. He stood on the rear section of the high deck, searching the\nsky. That Fused had watched them leave Celebrant. The enemy would find\nthem eventually.\nDalinar alone. Surrounded by nine shadows …\nKaladin finally handed the spyglass to the anxious mistspren. The\ncaptain of the ship, in a tight uniform that probably would have been\nuncomfortable on a human, approached and dismissed the sailor, who\nscuttled away.\n“I would prefer,” Captain Notum said, “if you would refrain from\nupsetting my crew.”\n“I would prefer that you let Syl go,” Kaladin snapped, feeling her\nanxiety through their bond. “As I told you, the Stormfather has condoned\nwhat she did. There is no crime.”\nThe short spren clasped his hands behind his back. Of all the spren\nthey’d interacted with on this side, the honorspren seemed to share the most\nhuman mannerisms."

And what would that do to Syl? She told me that losing a bonded\nRadiant was hard on their spren.”\n“True. But she would recover, and it might be for the best. Your\nrelationship with the Ancient Daughter is … inappropriate.”\n“It’s not like we eloped.”\n“It is worse, as the Nahel bond is far more intimate a relationship. The\nlinking of spirits. This is not a thing that should be done lightly,\nunsupervised. Besides, the Ancient Daughter is too young.”\n“Young?” Kaladin said. “Didn’t you just call her ancient?”\n“It would be difficult to explain to a human.”\n“Try anyway.”\nThe captain sighed. “The honorspren were created by Honor himself,\nmany thousands of years ago. You call him the Almighty, and … I’m afraid\nhe’s dead.”\n“Which makes sense, as it’s pretty much the only excuse I would have\naccepted.”\n“That wasn’t levity, human,” Notum said. “Your god is dead.”\n“Not my god. But please continue.”\n“Well…” Notum frowned; he’d obviously thought the concept of\nHonor’s death would have been more difficult for Kaladin to accept. “Well,\nsometime before his death, Honor stopped creating honorspren. We don’t\nknow why, but he asked the Stormfather to do it instead.”\n“He was setting up an heir. I’ve heard that the Stormfather is a kind of\nimage of the Almighty.”\n“More like a weak shadow,” Notum said. “You … actually understand\nthis?”\n“Understand, no. Follow? Mostly.”\n“The Stormfather created only a handful of children. All of these, save\nSylphrena, were destroyed in the Recreance, becoming deadeyes. This loss\nstung the Stormfather, who didn’t create again for centuries. When he was\nfinally moved to remake the honorspren, he created only ten more. My\ngreat-grandmother was among them; she created my grandfather, who\ncreated my father, who eventually created me.\n“It was only recently, even by your reckoning, that the Ancient Daughter\nwas rediscovered. Asleep. So, in answer to your question, yes, Sylphrena is\nboth old and young. Old of form, but young of mind. She is not ready to\ndeal with humans, and certainly not ready for a bond. I wouldn’t trust\nmyself with one of those.”\n“You think we’re too changeable, don’t you? That we can’t keep our\noaths.”\n“I’m no highspren,” the captain spat. “I can see that the variety of\nhumankind is what gives you strength. Your ability to change your minds,\nto go against what you once thought, can be a great advantage. But your\nbond is dangerous, without Honor. There will not be enough checks upon\nyour power—you risk disaster.”\n“How?”\nNotum shook his head, then looked away, off into the distance. “I cannot\nanswer. You should not have bonded Sylphrena, either way. She is too\nprecious to the Stormfather.”"

Killing you would free her—though it would be painful\nfor her. There are other ways, at least until the Final Ideal is sworn.”\n“I can’t imagine you’d be willing to kill a man for this,” Kaladin said.\n“Tell me truthfully.

You must know how she feels.”\nThe captain didn’t speak.\nFinally, Kaladin gritted his teeth and strode off. The captain didn’t\ndemand that Kaladin go down below, so he took up a position at the very\nfront of the high deck, hanging out over the bow.\nWith one hand on the flagpole, Kaladin rested a boot on the low railing,\noverlooking the sea of beads. He wore his uniform today, since he’d been\nable to wash it the previous night. Honor’s Path had good accommodations\nfor humans, including a device that made a great deal of water. The design\n—if not the vessel itself—probably stretched back centuries to when\nRadiants traveled Shadesmar with their spren.\nBeneath him, the ship creaked as sailors shifted her heading. To the left,\nhe could see land. Longbrow’s Straits—on the other side of which they’d\nfind Thaylen City. Tantalizingly close.\nTechnically, he was no longer Dalinar’s bodyguard. But storms, during\nthe Weeping, Kaladin had nearly abandoned his duty. The thought of\nDalinar needing him now—while Kaladin was trapped and unable to help—\nbrought a pain that was almost physical. He’d failed so many people in his\nlife.…\nLife before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before destination.\nTogether, these Words formed the First Ideal of the Windrunners. He’d said\nthem, but he wasn’t certain he understood them.\nThe Second Ideal made more direct sense. I will protect those who\ncannot protect themselves. Straightforward, yes … but overwhelming. The\nworld was a place of suffering. Was he really supposed to try to prevent it\nall?\nI will protect even those I hate, so long as it is right. The Third Ideal\nmeant standing up for anyone, if needed. But who decided what was\n“right”? Which side was he supposed to protect?\nThe Fourth Ideal was unknown to him, but the closer he drew to it, the\nmore frightened he became. What would it demand of him?\nSomething crystallized in the air beside him, a line of light like a\npinprick in the air that trailed a long, soft luminescence. A mistspren sailor\nnear him gasped, then nudged his companion. She whispered something in\nawe, then both scrambled away.\nWhat have I done now?\nA second pinprick of light appeared near him, spinning, coordinated with\nthe other.

It was rare that he heard her directly in his mind.\n“Standing on the deck. What’s happened?”\nNothing. I can just … feel your mind right now. Stronger than usual.\nThey let you out?\n“Yes.

They took a moment to fly up and spin\nabout him before heading to the south, faster than the ship.\nThe strange pinpricks of light continued to whirl around him. Sailors\ngathered behind, making a ruckus until the captain pushed through and\ngaped.\n“What are they?” Kaladin asked, nodding toward the pinpricks of light.\n“Windspren.”\n“Oh.” They did remind him a little of the way windspren would fly on\ngusts of wind. “They’re common. Why is everyone so upset?”\n“They’re not common on this side,” the captain said. “They live on your\nside, almost completely. I … I’ve never seen them before. They’re\nbeautiful.”\nPerhaps I haven’t been giving Notum enough credit, Kaladin thought.\nPerhaps he would listen to a different kind of plea.\n“Captain,” Kaladin said. “I have taken an oath, as a Windrunner, to\nprotect. And the Bondsmith who leads us is in danger.”\n“Bondsmith?” the captain asked. “Which one?”\n“Dalinar Kholin.”\n“No. Which Bondsmith, of the three?”\n“I don’t know what you mean,” Kaladin said. “But his spren is the\nStormfather.

You say that\nyou can see how human variety gives us strength—well, I challenge you to\ndo the same. See beyond the letter of your rules. You must understand that\nmy need to defend the Bondsmith is more important than your need to\ndeliver Syl—especially considering that the Stormfather is well aware of\nher location.”\nThe captain glanced at the windspren, which were still spinning about\nKaladin, leaving trails that drifted the entire length of the ship before"

They illuminated his heroic figure—\ndetermined, undaunted, one hand on the prow’s flagpole, wearing his crisp\nWall Guard uniform. The ship’s spren gazed upon him as if he were a\nstorming Herald come to announce the reclamation of the Tranquiline Halls.\nJust ahead of him, Shallan seemed to change. It was in her bearing, the\nway she stopped resting lightly on one foot, and stood solidly on two feet\ninstead. The way her posture shifted.\nAnd the way that she seemed to melt upon seeing Kaladin, lips rising to\na grin. Blushing, she adopted a fond—even eager—expression.\nAdolin breathed out slowly. He’d caught those glimpses from her before\n—and seen the sketches of Kaladin in her book—but looking at her now, he\ncouldn’t deny what he was seeing. She was practically leering.\n“I need to draw that,” she said. But she just stood there instead, staring at\nhim.\nAdolin sighed and made his way up onto the high deck. Seemed they\nweren’t forbidden here any longer. He joined Pattern, who had come up\nanother set of steps, and was humming happily to himself.\n“Kind of hard to compete with that,” Adolin noted.\n“Mmm,” Pattern said.\n“You know, I’ve never really felt like this before? It’s not just Kaladin,\nit’s all of this. And what’s happening to us.” He shook his head. “We\ncertainly are an odd bunch.”\n“Yes. Seven people. Odd.”\n“It’s not like I can blame him. It’s not as if he’s trying to be like he is.”\nNearby, a sailor spren—one of the few who hadn’t gathered around\nStormblessed and his halo of glowing lights—lowered a spyglass. She\nfrowned, then raised it again. Then she began to call out in the spren\nlanguage.\nPeople tore themselves away from Kaladin and crowded around. Adolin\nstepped back, watching until Kaladin and Shallan joined him. Azure crested\nthe steps nearby, looking concerned.\n“What is it?” Kaladin asked.\n“No idea,” Adolin said.\nThe captain waved for the mistspren and honorspren to make space, then\ntook the spyglass. He finally lowered it and looked back at Kaladin. “You\nwere right, human, when you said you might be followed.” He waved\nKaladin and Adolin forward. “Look low on the horizon, at two hundred ten\ndegrees.”\nKaladin looked through the spyglass, then breathed out. He extended it\ntoward Adolin, but Shallan snatched it first.\n“Storms!” she said. “There’s at least six of them.”\n“Eight, my scout says,” the captain replied.\nAdolin finally got his turn. Because of the black sky, it took him forever"

Neshua Kadal\nRe-Shephir, the Midnight Mother, is another Unmade who appears to\nhave been destroyed at Aharietiam.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 250\nDalinar ran his fingers along a line of red crystal embedded in the stone\nwall. The little vein started at the ceiling and wound all the way down the\nwall—within the pattern of the light green and grey strata—to the floor. It\nwas smooth to the touch, distinct in texture from the rock around it.\nHe rubbed his thumb across the crystal. It’s like the other strata lines\nripple out from this one, getting wider as they move away from it.\n“What does it mean?” he asked Navani. The two of them stood in a\nstorage room near the top of the tower.\n“I don’t know,” Navani said, “but we’re finding more and more of them.\nWhat do you know of Essential Theology?”\n“A thing for ardents and scribes,” he said.\n“And Soulcasters. That is a garnet.”\nGarnet? Let’s see … Emeralds for grain, that was the most important,\nand heliodors for flesh. They raised animals for their gemhearts to provide\nthose two. He was pretty sure diamonds made quartz, and … storms, he\ndidn’t know much about the others. Topaz made stone. They’d needed those\nfor the bunkers on the Shattered Plains.\n“Garnets make blood,” Navani said. “We don’t have any Soulcasters that\nuse them.”\n“Blood? That sounds useless.”\n“Well, scientifically, we think Soulcasters were able to use garnets to\nmake any liquid that was soluble in water, as opposed to oil-based … Your\neyes are crossing.”\n“Sorry.” He felt at the crystals. “Another mystery. When will we find\nanswers?”\n“The records below,” Navani said, “speak of this tower like a living\nthing. With a heart of emerald and ruby, and now these veins of garnet.”\nHe stood up, looking around the darkened room, which held the\nmonarchs’ chairs between meetings. It was lit by a sphere he’d set on a\nstone ledge by the door.\n“If this tower was alive,” Dalinar said, “then it’s dead now.”\n“Or sleeping. But if that’s the case, I have no idea how to wake it. We’ve\ntried infusing the heart like a fabrial, even had Renarin try to push\nStormlight into it. Nothing’s worked.”\nDalinar picked up a chair, then pushed the door open. He held the door\nwith his foot—shooing away a guard who tried to do it for him—while\nNavani collected the sphere and joined him in the conference room, in front\nof the glass wall looking toward the Origin.\nHe set down the chair and checked his forearm clock.

With\nspanreeds confirming the storm’s arrival hours before in the east, the\ncalculations were down to judging the speed of the storm.\nA runner arrived at the door. Creer—the duty sergeant for guards today\n—accepted it. He was a bridgeman from … Bridge Twenty, was it? He and\nhis brother were both guards, though Creer wore spectacles, unlike his twin.\n“Message from Brightness Khal, sir,” Creer said, handing the note to\nNavani. It looked like it had come from a spanreed. It had marks on the\nsides from the clips that had held it to the board, and the tight letters\ncovered only the center of the page.\n“From Fen,” Navani said. “A merchant ship vanished in the Southern\nDepths this morning, just off Marat. They went ashore at what they hoped\nwas a safe distance—to use the spanreed—and reported a large number of\nships at dock along the coast. Glowing figures rose from a nearby city and\ndescended upon them, and the communication cut off.”\n“Confirmation,” Dalinar said, “that the enemy is building up a navy.” If\nthat fleet launched from Marat before his own ships were ready, or if the\nwinds were wrong when his armada did launch …\n“Have Teshav write back to the Thaylens,” Dalinar said. “Suggest to\nQueen Fen and our other allies that we hold the next meeting in Thaylen\nCity. We’ll want to inspect fortifications and shore up the ground defenses.”\nHe sent the guards to wait outside, then approached the window and\nchecked his wrist clock. Just a few minutes left. He thought he could see the\nstormwall below, but it was difficult to be sure from this height. He wasn’t\naccustomed to looking down on a highstorm.\n“Are you sure you want to do this?” Navani asked.\n“The Stormfather asked me something similar this morning. I asked him\nif he knew the first rule of warfare.”\n“Is that the one about terrain, or the one about attacking where the\nenemy is weak?”\nHe could pick it out now, a dark ripple surging through the sky below.\n“Neither,” Dalinar said.\n“Ah, right,” Navani said. “I should have guessed.” She was nervous,\nwith good cause. It was the first time he’d stepped back into the visions\nsince meeting Odium.\nBut Dalinar felt blind in this war. He didn’t know what the enemy\nwanted, or how they intended to exploit their conquests.\nThe first rule of war. Know your enemy.\nHe raised his chin as the storm slammed into Urithiru, roughly at the\nheight of its third tier.\nAll went white. Then Dalinar appeared in the ancient palace—the large\nopen room with sandstone pillars and a balcony that looked out on an\nantiquated version of Kholinar.

A slender\nParshendi woman appeared beside the king, in the spot Dalinar had\noccupied so long ago. Her skin was marbled red and white in a complex\npattern, and she had long orange-red hair. She looked down with red eyes,\nsurprised by her sudden appearance and the robes she wore, those of an\nadvisor to the king.\nNohadon began speaking to her as if she were his friend Karm. “I don’t\nknow what to do, old friend.”\nOdium sees that a vision has begun, the Stormfather warned Dalinar. The\nenemy is focusing on us. He comes.\n“Can you hold him back?”\nI am but a shadow of a god. His power vastly outstrips my own. He\nsounded smaller than Dalinar was accustomed to. Like the quintessential\nbully, the Stormfather didn’t know how to face someone stronger than\nhimself.\n“Can you hold him back? I need time to talk to her.”\nI will … try.\nGood enough. Unfortunately, it meant that Dalinar didn’t have time to let\nthis Parshendi woman experience the vision in full. He strode toward her\nand Nohadon.\n* * *\nVenli turned around. Where was she? This wasn’t Marat. Had Odium\nsummoned her again?\nNo. It’s the wrong storm. He doesn’t come during highstorms.\nA young Alethi male in robes was blathering at her. She ignored him,\nbiting her hand to see if she could feel the pain.\nShe could. She shook her hand and looked down at the robes she wore.\nThis couldn’t be a dream. It was too real.\n“My friend?” the Alethi man asked. “Are you well? I realize that events\nhave taken their toll on us all, but—”\nFootsteps rang loudly on the stone as another Alethi man approached,\nwearing a crisp blue uniform. White dusted the hair at his temples, and his\nface wasn’t as … round as other human faces. His features could almost\nhave been those of a listener, even if that nose was wrong and the face bore\nfar more creases than a listener’s ever would.\nWait … she thought, attuning Curiosity. Is that …\n“Disturbance on the battlefield, sir,” the older man said to her\ncompanion. “You are needed immediately.”\n“What is this? I didn’t hear—”\n“They didn’t say what it was, Your Majesty, only that you are urgently\nrequested.”\nThe human king drew his lips to a tight line, and then—obviously\nfrustrated—stalked toward the doorway. “Come,” he said to Venli.\nThe older man grabbed her arm above the elbow. “Don’t,” he said softly.\n“We need to talk.”\nThis is the Alethi warlord.\n“My name is Dalinar Kholin,” the man said. “I lead the Alethi, and\nyou’re seeing a vision of past events. Only your mind has been transported,\nnot your body. We two are the only real people here.”\nShe yanked her arm out of his hand and attuned Irritation. “How … why\nhave you brought me here?”"

Now that you’re losing, now that we’ve seized your\ncapital, now you want to talk. What of the years spent slaughtering my\npeople on the Shattered Plains?” It had been a game to them. Listener spy\nreports had shown the humans had enjoyed the sport on the Shattered\nPlains. Claiming wealth, and listener lives, as part of a grand contest.\n“We were willing to talk, when you sent your emissary,” Dalinar said.\n“The Shardbearer. I’m willing to talk again now. I want to forget old\ngrievances, even those personal to me.”\nVenli walked away, still attuned to Irritation. “How have you brought me\nto this place? Is this a prison?” Is this your work, Odium? Testing my loyalty\nwith a false vision of the enemy?\nShe was using the old rhythms. She’d never been able to do that when\nOdium’s attention had been on her.\n“I’ll send you back soon,” Kholin said, catching up to her. Though he\nwas not short for a human, her current form was a good six inches taller\nthan he was. “Please, just hear me out. I need to know. What would a truce\nbetween our people cost?”\n“A truce?” she asked to Amusement, stopping near the balcony. “A\ntruce?”\n“Peace. No Desolation. No war. What would it cost?”\n“Well, for a start, it would cost your kingdom.”\nHe grimaced. His words were dead, like those of all humans, but he wore\nhis feelings on his face. So much passion and emotion.\nIs that why the spren betrayed us for them?\n“What is Alethkar to you?” he said. “I can help you build a new nation\non the Shattered Plains. I will give you laborers to raise cities, ardents to\nteach any skill you want. Wealth, as payment in ransom for Kholinar and its\npeople. A formal apology. Whatever you demand.”\n“I demand that we keep Alethkar.”\nHis face became a mask of pain, his brow furrowed. “Why must you live\nthere? To you, Alethkar is a place to conquer. But it’s my homeland.”\nShe attuned Reprimand. “Don’t you understand? The people who live\nthere—the singers, my cousins—are from Alethkar. That is their homeland\ntoo. The only difference between them and you is that they were born as\nslaves, and you as their master!”\nHe winced. “Perhaps some other accommodation, then. A … dividing of\nthe kingdom? A parshman highprince?” He seemed shocked to be\nconsidering it.\nShe attuned Resolve. “Your tone implies you know that would be\nimpossible. There can be no accommodation, human. Send me from this\nplace. We can meet on the battlefield.”\n“No.” He seized her arm again. “I don’t know what the accommodation\nwill be, but we can find one. Let me prove to you that I want to negotiate,\ninstead of fight.”\n“You can start,” she said to Irritation, pulling away from him, “by not"

Her current body was\ntall, but fragile. And in truth, she’d never been proficient at battle, even\nduring the days when she’d taken an appropriate form.\n“At least let us try a negotiation,” he said. “Please.”\nHe didn’t sound very pleading. He’d grown stern, face like a stone,\nglaring. With the rhythms, you could infuse your tone with the mood you\nwished to convey, even if your emotions weren’t cooperating. Humans\ndidn’t have that tool. They were as dull as the dullest slave.\nA sudden thump resounded in the vision. Venli attuned Anxiety and\nrushed out onto the balcony. A half-destroyed city stretched below, where a\nbattle had happened, dead heaped in piles.\nThat pounding sounded again. The … the air was breaking. The clouds\nand sky seemed to be a mural painted on an enormous dome ceiling, and as\nthe pounds continued, a web of cracks appeared overhead.\nBeyond them shone a vivid yellow light.\n“He’s here,” she whispered, then waved toward it. “That’s why there\ncan’t be a negotiation, human. He knows we don’t need one. You want\npeace? Surrender. Give yourselves up and hope that he doesn’t care to\ndestroy you.”\nA faint hope, considering what Rine had said to her about exterminating\nthe humans.\nWith the next pound, the sky fractured and a hole appeared overhead, a\npowerful light shining beyond. The very shards of the air—broken like a\nmirror—were sucked into that light.\nA pulse of power blasted from the hole, shaking the city with a terrible\nvibration. It tossed Venli to the balcony’s floor. Kholin reached to help her,\nbut a second pulse caused him to fall as well.\nThe bricks in the room’s wall separated from one another and began to\nfloat apart. The boards that made up the balcony began to lift, nails floating\ninto the sky. A guard ran to the balcony, but stumbled, and his very skin\nstarted to separate into water and a dried husk.\nEverything just … came apart.\nA wind rose around Venli, pulling debris toward that hole in the sky, and\nthe brilliant, terrible light beyond. Boards shredded to splinters; bricks\nfloated past her head. She growled, the Rhythm of Resolve thumping inside\nher as she grabbed and clung to parts of the floor that hadn’t yet separated.\nThat burning. She knew it well, the terrible pain of Odium’s heat\nscalding her skin, scorching her until her very bones—somehow still able to\nfeel—became ash. It happened every time he gave her orders. What worse\nthing would he do if he found her fraternizing with the enemy?\nShe attuned Determination and crawled away from the light. Escape!\nShe reached the chamber beyond the balcony and lurched to her feet, trying\nto run.

Then … she stopped and looked back again. Dalinar Kholin stood\non the balcony. And he was glowing.\nNeshua Kadal. Radiant Knight.\nWithout meaning to, she attuned the Rhythm of Awe. Around Kholin, the\nbalcony was stable. Boards trembled and quivered at his feet, but did not\nmove into the sky. The balcony railing had ripped apart to either side of\nhim, but where he held to it with a firm grip, it remained secure.\nHe was her enemy, and yet …\nLong ago, these humans had resisted her gods.

Boards and stones sank down from the air,\nreknitting. Venli’s current block of stone settled back into place. All through\nthe city, buildings burst apart and zoomed upward, but the walls of this\ntower returned to their positions.\nVenli immediately made for the steps downward. If whatever Kholin was\ndoing stopped, she wanted to be on solid rock. She wound her way to the\nground floor, then—once on the street—she positioned herself near the\nbalcony and Kholin’s influence.\nAbove, Odium’s light went out.\nStones and splinters rained down on the city, crashing about her. Dried\nbodies dropped like discarded clothing.

No cries of fear,\nno moans of pain. Bodies were just husks, skins lying empty on the ground.\nA sudden pounding broke the air behind her, opening another hole, lower\ndown and near the edge of the city. The sky crumbled into the gap,\nrevealing that hateful light again. It consumed everything near it—wall,\nbuildings, even the ground disintegrating and flowing into the maw.\nDust and debris washed over Venli in a furious wind.

She controlled her fall, going down on\nher side and skidding on the stones, feet toward the oppressive light.

He collapsed into the seat he’d placed there, Navani taking his\narm, concerned.\nThrough his bond, Dalinar sensed weeping. The Stormfather had kept\nOdium back, but storms, he had paid a price. The most powerful spren on\nRoshar—embodiment of the tempest that shaped all life—was crying like a\nchild, whispering that Odium was too strong.\n110. A Million Stars\nThe Midnight Mother created monsters of shadow and oil, dark\nimitations of creatures she saw or consumed. Their description\nmatches no spren I can find in modern literature.\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 252\nCaptain Notum gave the command, and two of the sailors unlatched a\nsection of the hull, exposing the crashing waves of beads just beyond.\nShallan put her freehand on the frame of the open cargo door and leaned\nout over the churning depths. Adolin tried to tug her back, but she remained\nin place.\nShe’d chosen to wear Veil’s outfit today, in part for the pockets. She\ncarried three larger gemstones; Kaladin carried four others. Their broams\nhad all run out of Stormlight. Even these larger, unset gems were getting\nclose to failing. Hopefully they would last long enough to get them to\nThaylen City and the Oathgate.\nBeyond the waves—so close that the sailors feared hidden rocks beneath\nthe beads—a dark landscape interrupted the horizon. The inverse of\nLongbrow’s Straits, a place where trees grew tall, forming a black jungle of\nglass plants.\nA sailor clomped down the steps into the hold and barked something at\nCaptain Notum. “Your enemies are close now,” the captain translated.\nHonor’s Path had made a heroic effort these last few hours, pushing its\nmandras to exhaustion—and it hadn’t been nearly enough. The Fused were\nslower than Kaladin could go, but they were still far faster than the ship.\nShallan looked at the captain; his bearded face, which glowed with a\nsoft, phantom light, betrayed nothing of what must have been a powerful\nconflict for him. Turn over the captives to the enemy and perhaps save his\ncrew? Or set them free, and hope the Ancient Daughter could escape?\nA door at the back of the hold opened, and Kaladin led Syl from her\ncabin. The captain had only now given permission to release her, as if\nwishing to delay the decision until the last possible moment. Syl’s color\nseemed muted, and she clung to Kaladin’s arm, unsteady. Was she going to\nbe able to make it to shore with them?\nShe’s a spren. She doesn’t need air. She’ll be fine. Hopefully.\n“Go, then,” the captain said. “And be swift. I cannot promise that my\ncrew, once captured, will be able to keep this secret for long.” Apparently it\nwas difficult to kill spren, but hurting them was quite easy.\nAnother sailor released Adolin’s sword spren from her cabin. She didn’t\nlook as weathered as Syl—one place seemed as good as another to her.\nKaladin led Syl over."

She didn’t\nlook as weathered as Syl—one place seemed as good as another to her.\nKaladin led Syl over.\n“Ancient Daughter,” the captain said, bowing his head.\n“Won’t meet my eyes, Notum?” Syl said. “I suppose locking me away\nhere isn’t too different from all those days you spent running about at\nFather’s whims back home.”\nHe didn’t reply, but instead turned away.\nWith Syl and the deadeye joining them, that only left one person. Azure\nlounged by the steps, wearing her breastplate and cloak, arms folded.\n“You sure you won’t change your mind?” Shallan asked.\nAzure shook her head.\n“Azure,” Kaladin said. “I was too harsh earlier. That doesn’t mean I—”\n“It’s not that,” she said. “I simply have a different thread to chase, and\nbesides, I left my men to fight these monsters in Kholinar. Doesn’t feel right\nto do the same again.” She smiled. “Don’t fear for me, Stormblessed. You\nwill have a much better chance if I stay here—as will these sailors. When\nyou boys next meet the swordsman who taught you that morning kata, warn\nhim that I’m looking for him.”\n“Zahel?” Adolin said. “You know Zahel?”\n“We’re old friends,” she said. “Notum, have your sailors been cutting\nthose bales of cloth into the shapes I requested?”\n“Yes,” the captain said. “But I don’t understand—”\n“You soon will.” She gave Kaladin a lazy salute. He returned it, sharper.\nThen she nodded to them and walked up toward the main deck.\nThe ship crashed through a large wave of beads, sending some through\nthe open cargo deck doors. Sailors with brooms started brushing them back\ntoward the opening.\n“Are you going?” the captain said to Shallan. “Every moment you delay\nincreases the danger to us all.” He still wouldn’t look at Syl.\nRight, Shallan thought. Well, someone had to start the party. She took\nAdolin by one hand and Pattern by the other. Kaladin linked hands with\nPattern and Syl, and Adolin grabbed his spren. They crowded into the\nopening into the cargo hold, looking at the glass beads below. Churning,\ncatching the light of a distant sun, sparkling like a million stars …\n“All right,” she said. “Jump!”\nShallan threw herself off the ship, joined by the others. She crashed into\nthe beads, which swallowed her. They seemed to slip too easily into them—\nlike before, when she’d fallen into this ocean, it felt like something was\npulling her down.\nShe sank into the beads, which rolled against her skin, overwhelming her\nsenses with thoughts of trees and rocks. She fought the sensations,\nstruggling to keep herself from thrashing too much. She clung to Adolin,\nbut Pattern’s hand was pulled from her grip.\nI can’t do this! I can’t let them claim me. I can’t—\nThey hit the bottom, which was shallow, here near the shore. Then\nShallan finally let herself draw in Stormlight. One precious gemstone’s\nworth. It sustained her, calmed her.

She fished in her pocket for the bead\nshe’d picked from the bucket earlier.\nWhen she fed the bead Stormlight, the other beads around her trembled,\nthen pulled back, forming the walls and ceiling of a small room. The\nStormlight curling from her skin illuminated the space with a faint glow.\nAdolin let go of her hand and fell to his knees, coughing and gasping. His\ndeadeye just stood there, as always.\n“Damnation,” Adolin said, wheezing. “Drowning with no water. It\nshouldn’t be so hard, should it? All we had to do was hold our breath.…”\nShallan stepped to the side of the room, listening. Yes … it was almost\nlike she could hear the beads whispering to her beneath their clattering. She\nplunged her hand through the wall and her fingers brushed cloth. She\ngrabbed hold, and a moment later Kaladin seized her arm and pulled\nhimself into the room made from beads, stumbling and falling to his knees.\nHe wasn’t glowing.\n“You didn’t use a gemstone?” Shallan asked.\n“Almost had to,” he said. He took a few deep breaths, then stood up.\n“But we need to conserve those.” He turned around. “Syl?”\nA disturbance at the other side of the chamber announced someone\napproaching. Whoever it was wasn’t able to get in until Shallan walked over\nand broke the surface of the bead wall with her hand. Pattern entered and\nlooked around the room, humming happily. “Mmm. A nice pattern,\nShallan.”\n“Syl,” Kaladin repeated. “We jumped hand-in-hand, but she let go.\nWhere—”\n“She’ll be fine,” Shallan said.\n“Mmm,” Pattern agreed. “Spren need no air.”\nKaladin took a deep breath, then nodded. He started pacing anyway, so\nShallan settled down on the ground to wait, pack in her lap. They each\ncarried a change of clothing, three water jugs, and some of the food Adolin\nhad purchased. Hopefully it would be enough to reach Thaylen City.\nThen she’d have to make the Oathgate work.\nThey waited as long as they dared, hoping the Fused had passed them by,\nchasing the ship. Finally, Shallan stood up and pointed. “That way.”\n“You sure?” Kaladin asked.\n“Yes. Even the slope agrees.” She kicked at the obsidian ground, which\nran at a gentle incline.\n“Right,” Adolin said. “Lock hands.”\nThey did so and—heart fluttering—Shallan recovered the Stormlight\nfrom her shell of a room. Beads came crashing down, enveloping her.\nThey started up the slope, against the tide of beads. It was more difficult\nthan she’d imagined; the current of the shifting beads seemed determined to\nhold them back. Still, she had Stormlight to sustain her. They soon reached\na place where the ground was too steep to walk on easily.

Beads rolled off her\nclothing, clattering against the ground, as the others pulled themselves onto\nthe shore.\n“I saw the enemy fly past,” Syl said. “I was hiding by the trees here.”\nAt her urging, they entered the forest of glass plants before settling down\nto recover from their escape. Shallan immediately felt herself itching for her\nsketchpad. These trees! The trunks were translucent; the leaves looked like\nthey were blown from glass in a multitude of colors. Moss drooped from\none branch, like melted green glass, strands hanging down in silky lines.\nWhen she touched them, they broke off.\nOverhead, the clouds rippled with the mother-of-pearl iridescence that\nmarked another highstorm in the real world. Shallan could barely see it\nthrough the canopy, but the effect on Pattern and Syl was immediate. They\nstood up straighter, and Syl’s wan color brightened to a healthy blue-white.\nPattern’s head shifted more quickly, spinning through a dozen different\ncycles in a matter of minutes.\nStormlight still trailed from Shallan’s skin. She’d taken in a rather large\namount of it, but hadn’t lost too much. She returned it to the gemstone, a\nprocess she didn’t quite understand, but which felt natural at the same time.\nNearby, Syl looked to the southwest with a kind of wistful, far-off\nexpression. “Syl?” Shallan asked.\n“There’s a storm that way too…” she whispered, then shook herself and\nseemed embarrassed.\nKaladin dug out two gemstones. “All right,” he said, “we fly.”\nThey’d decided to use two gemstones’ worth of Stormlight to fly inward,\na gamble to get a head start on their hike—and to get away from the coast.\nHopefully the Fused wouldn’t treat the honorspren too harshly. Shallan\nworried for them, but equally for what would happen if the Fused doubled\nback to search for her group.\nA short flight now should deposit them far enough inland that they’d be\ntough to locate. Once they landed, they would hike across several days’\nworth of Shadesmar landscape before reaching the island of Thaylenah,\nwhich would manifest as a lake here. Thaylen City, and its Oathgate, were\non the very rim of that lake.\nKaladin Lashed them one at a time—and fortunately, his arts worked on\nthe spren as they did humans.

Tall, orderly, with shining buttons and\na sharp posture, he was the very image of a perfect Alethi officer.\n“Report,” Dalinar said, hopefully keeping the dislike out of his voice.\nAmaram—Sadeas—fell into step with Dalinar, and they walked to the\nedge of the Oathgate platform, overlooking the city. Dalinar’s guards gave\nthem space to converse.\n“Our crews have done wonders for this city, Brightlord,” Amaram said.\n“We focused our initial attentions on the debris outside the walls. I worried\nthat would give an invading force too much cover—not to mention rubble\nto construct a ramp up to the wall.”\nIndeed, the plain before the city walls—which had once housed the\nmarkets and warehouses of the docks—was completely clear. A killing field,\ninterrupted by the occasional outline of a broken foundation. The Almighty\nonly knew how the Thaylen military had allowed a collection of buildings\noutside the walls in the first place. That would have been a nightmare to\ndefend.\n“We shored up positions where the wall was weakened,” Amaram\ncontinued, gesturing. “It’s not high by Kholinar standards, but is an\nimpressive fortification nonetheless. We cleared out the buildings right\ninside to provide staging and resource dumps, and my army is camped\nthere. We then helped with general reconstruction.”\n“The city looks far better,” Dalinar said. “Your men did well.”\n“Then maybe our penance can be over,” Amaram said. He said it\nstraight, though angerspren—a pool of boiling blood—spread from beneath\nhis right foot.\n“Your work here was important, soldier. You didn’t only rebuild a city;\nyou built the trust of the Thaylen people.”\n“Of course.” Amaram added, more softly, “And I do see the tactical\nimportance of knowing the enemy fortifications.”\nYou fool. “The Thaylens are not our enemies.”\n“I misspoke,” Amaram said. “Yet I cannot ignore that the Kholin troops\nhave been deployed to the border between our kingdom and Jah Keved.\nYour men get to liberate our homeland, while mine spend their days digging\nin rocks. You do realize the effect this has on their morale, particularly since\nmany of them still assume you assassinated their highprince.”\n“I hope that their current leader has worked to disabuse them of such\nfalse notions.”\nAmaram finally turned to look Dalinar in the eyes. Those angerspren\nwere still there, though his tone was crisp and militaristic. “Brightlord. I\nknow you for a realist. I’ve modeled my career after yours. Frankly, even if\nyou did kill him—which I know you must deny—I would respect you for it.\nTorol was a liability to this nation.\n“Let me prove to you that I am not the same. Storms, Dalinar! I’m your\nbest frontline general, and you know it. Torol spent years wasting me\nbecause my reputation intimidated him. Don’t make the same mistake. Use\nme. Let me fight for Alethkar, not kiss the feet of Thaylen merchants! I—”\n“Enough,” Dalinar snapped. “Follow your orders. That is how you’ll\nprove yourself to me.”"

That is how you’ll\nprove yourself to me.”\nAmaram stepped back, then—after a deliberate pause—saluted. He spun\non his heel and marched down into the city.\nThat man … Dalinar thought. Dalinar had intended to tell him that this\nisland would host the front lines in the war, but the conversation had slipped\nfrom him. Well, Amaram might quickly get the fighting he wanted—a fact\nhe would discover soon enough, at the planning meeting.\nBoots on stone sounded behind him as a group of men in blue uniforms\njoined him at the rim of the plateau. “Permission to stab him a little, sir,”\nsaid Teft, the bridgeman leader.\n“How do you stab someone ‘a little,’ soldier?”\n“I could do it,” Lyn said. “I’ve only started training with a spear. We\ncould claim it was an accident.”\n“No, no,” Lopen said. “You want to stab him a little? Let my cousin\nHuio do it, sir. He’s the expert on little things.”\n“Short joke?” Huio said in his broken Alethi. “Be glad not short temper.”\n“I’m just trying to involve you, Huio. I know that most people overlook\nyou. It’s very easy to do, you see.…”\n“Attention!” Dalinar snapped, though he found himself smiling. They\nscrambled into ranks. Kaladin had trained them well.\n“You’ve got”—Dalinar checked the clock on his arm—“thirty-seven\nminutes until the meeting, men. And, er, women. Don’t be late.”\nThey rushed off, chatting among themselves. Navani, Jasnah, and\nRenarin joined him soon after, and his wife gave him a sly smile as she\nnoticed him checking his arm clock again. Storming woman had gotten him\nto start arriving early for appointments just by strapping a device to his arm.\nAs they gathered, Fen’s son climbed up onto the Oathgate platform and\ngreeted Dalinar warmly. “We have rooms for you, above the temple where\nwe’ll be meeting. I … well, we know you don’t need them, since you can\nsimply Oathgate home in an instant…”\n“We’ll take them gladly, son,” Dalinar said. “I could use a little\nrefreshment and time to think.”\nThe young man grinned. Dalinar never would get used to those spiked\neyebrows.\nThey climbed down from the platform, and a Thaylen guard gave the all\nclear. A scribe sent word via spanreed that the next transfer could take\nplace. Dalinar paused to watch. A minute later a flash occurred, surrounding\nthe Oathgate with light. The Oathgates were under almost perpetual use\nthese days—Malata was running the device today, as was becoming her\nduty more often.\n“Uncle?” Jasnah said as he lingered.\n“Merely curious about who’s coming in next.”\n“I could pull the records for you…” Jasnah said.\nThe new arrivals turned out to be a group of Thaylen merchants in\npompous clothing. They made their way down the larger ramp, surrounded\nby guards and accompanied by several men carrying large chests."

They made their way down the larger ramp, surrounded\nby guards and accompanied by several men carrying large chests.\n“More bankers,” Fen’s son said. “The quiet economic collapse of Roshar\ncontinues.”\n“Collapse?” Dalinar said, surprised.\n“Bankers all across the continent have been pulling out of cities,” Jasnah\nsaid, pointing. “See that fortress of a building at the front of the Ancient\nWard down below? That’s the Thaylen Gemstone Reserve.”\n“Local governments are going to have difficulty financing troops after\nthis,” Fen’s son said with a grimace. “They’ll have to write here with\nauthorized spanreeds and get spheres shipped to them. It’s going to be a\nnightmare of logistics for anyone not close to an Oathgate.”\nDalinar frowned. “Couldn’t you encourage the merchants to stay and\nsupport the cities they were in?”\n“Sir!” he replied. “Sir, force the merchants to obey military authority?”\n“Forget I asked,” Dalinar said, sharing a look with Navani and Jasnah.\nNavani smiled fondly at what was probably a huge social misstep, but he\nsuspected Jasnah agreed with him. She’d probably have seized the banks\nand used them to fund the war.\nRenarin lingered, watching the merchants. “How big are the gemstones\nthey’ve brought?” he asked.\n“Brightlord?” Fen’s son asked, glancing toward Dalinar for help.\n“They’ll be spheres. Normal spheres.”\n“Any larger gemstones?” Renarin asked. He turned toward them.\n“Anywhere in the city?”\n“Sure, lots of them,” Fen’s son said. “Some really nice pieces, like in\nevery city. Um … why, Brightlord?”\n“Because,” Renarin said. He didn’t say anything more.\n* * *\nDalinar splashed water onto his face from a basin in his rooms, which were\nin a villa above the temple of Talenelat, on the top tier of the city—the\nRoyal Ward. He wiped his face with the towel and reached out to the\nStormfather. “Feeling any better?”\nI do not feel like men. I do not sicken like men. I am. The Stormfather\nrumbled. I could have been destroyed, though. Splintered into a thousand\npieces. I live only because the enemy fears exposing himself to a strike from\nCultivation.\n“So she lives still, then? The third god?”\nYes. You’ve met her.\n“I … I have?”\nYou do not remember. But normally, she hides. Cowardice.\n“Perhaps wisdom,” Dalinar said. “The Nightwatcher—”\nIs not her.\n“Yes, you’ve said. The Nightwatcher is like you. Are there others,\nthough? Spren like you, or the Nightwatcher? Spren that are shadows of\ngods?”\nThere is … a third sibling. They are not with us.\n“In hiding?”\nNo. Slumbering.\n“Tell me more.”\nNo.\n“But—”\nNo! Leave them alone.

The air smelled of salt, reminding him of something not yet clear\nin his mind. One last hole in his memory. A trip by sea.\nAnd his visit to the Valley.\nHe glanced at the dresser beside the washbasin, which held a book\nwritten in unfamiliar Thaylen glyphs. A little note beside it, in Alethi\nglyphs, read, “Pathway. King.” Fen had left him a gift, a copy of The Way of\nKings in Thaylen.\n“I’ve done it,” Dalinar said. “I’ve united them, Stormfather. I’ve kept my\noath, and have brought men together, instead of dividing them. Perhaps this\ncan be penance in some small way, for the pain I’ve caused.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled in reply.\n“Did he … care about what we felt?” Dalinar asked. “Honor, the\nAlmighty? Did he truly care about men’s pain?”\nHe did. Then, I didn’t understand why, but now I do. Odium lies when he\nclaims to have sole ownership of passion. The Stormfather paused. I\nremember … at the end … Honor was more obsessed with oaths. There\nwere times when the oath itself was more important than the meaning\nbehind it. But he was not a passionless monster. He loved humankind. He\ndied defending you.\nDalinar found Navani entertaining Taravangian in the common area of\ntheir villa. “Your Majesty?” Dalinar asked.\n“You could call me Vargo, if you wish,” Taravangian said, pacing\nwithout looking at Dalinar. “It is what they called me as a youth.…”\n“What’s wrong?” Dalinar asked.\n“I’m just worried. My scholars … It is nothing, Dalinar. Nothing.\nSilliness. I am … I am well today.” He stopped and squeezed his pale grey\neyes shut.\n“That’s good, isn’t it?”\n“Yes. But it is not a day to be heartless. So I worry.”\nHeartless? What did he mean?\n“Do you need to sit out the meeting?” Navani asked.\nTaravangian shook his head quickly. “Come. Let us go. I will be\nbetter … better once we’ve started. I’m sure.”\n* * *\nAs Dalinar stepped into the temple’s main chamber, he found that he was\nlooking forward to the meeting.\nWhat a strange revelation. He’d spent so much of his youth and middle\nyears dreading politics and the endless rambling of meetings. Now he was\nexcited. He could see the outlines of something grand in this room. The\nAzish delegation warmly greeted Queen Fen, with Vizier Noura even giving\nFen a poem she’d written as thanks for the Thaylen hospitality.

They carried notepads and pencils, and had sewn\nBridge Four patches to the upper sleeves of their dresses—the place where\nscribes commonly wore their platoon insignia.\nAlethi highprinces, Azish viziers, Knights Radiant, and Thaylen admirals\nall in one room. The prime of Emul talking tactics with Aladar, who had\nbeen aiding the beleaguered country. General Khal and Teshav speaking\nwith the princess of Yezier, who was eyeing Halam Khal—their eldest son\n—standing tall in his father’s Shardplate by the door. There was talk of a\npolitical union there. It would be the first in centuries between an Alethi and\na Makabaki princedom.\nUnite them. A voice whispered the words in Dalinar’s mind, echoing\nwith the same resonant sound from months ago, when Dalinar had first\nstarted seeing the visions.\n“I’m doing so,” Dalinar whispered back.\nUnite them.\n“Stormfather, is that you? Why do you keep saying this to me?”\nI said nothing.\nIt was growing hard to distinguish between his own thoughts and what\ncame from the Stormfather. Visions and memories struggled for space in\nDalinar’s brain. To clear his mind, he strode around the perimeter of the\ncircular temple chamber. Murals on the walls—ones he had healed with his\nabilities—depicted the Herald Talenelat during several of his many, many\nlast stands against the Voidbringers.\nA large map had been mounted on one wall depicting the Tarat Sea and\nsurrounding areas, with markers noting the locations of their fleet. The\nroom quieted as Dalinar stepped up and studied this. He glanced for a\nmoment out the doors of the temple, toward the bay. Already, a few of the\nfaster ships of their fleet had arrived, flying the flags of both Kharbranth and\nAzir.\n“Your Excellency,” Dalinar said to Yanagawn. “Could you share news of\nyour troops?”\nThe emperor gave leave for Noura to report. The main fleet was less than\na day away. Their outriders—or scout ships, as she called them—had\nspotted no indications of the enemy advance. They’d worried that this\nwindow between storms would be when the enemy would move, but so far\nthere was no sign.\nThe admirals began to discuss how to best patrol the seas while keeping\nThaylen City safe. Dalinar was pleased by the conversation, mostly because\nthe admirals seemed to think that the real danger to Thaylen City had\npassed. A Veden highprince had managed to get a foot scout close enough to\nMarat to count the ships at the docks. Well over a hundred vessels were\nwaiting in the various coves and ports along the coast. For whatever reason,\nthey weren’t ready to launch yet, which was a blessing.\nThe meeting progressed, with Fen belatedly welcoming everyone—\nDalinar realized he should have let her take charge from the start. She\ndescribed the defenses in Thaylen City and raised concerns from her\nguildmasters about Amaram’s troops. Apparently they’d been carousing."

As the Azish scribes began explaining\ntheir code of rules and guidelines for the coalition, Renarin excused himself\nin a hoarse voice, and left.\nDalinar glanced at Navani, who seemed troubled. Jasnah stood to follow,\nbut was interrupted by a scribe bringing her a small sheaf of documents.\nShe accepted them and moved to Navani’s side so they could study them\ntogether.\nShould we break? Dalinar thought, checking his forearm clock. They’d\nonly been going for an hour, and the Azish were obviously excited by their\nguidelines.\nThe Stormfather rumbled.\nWhat? Dalinar thought.\nSomething … something is coming. A storm.\nDalinar stood up, looking about the room, half expecting assassins to\nattack. His sudden motion caught the attention of one of the Azish viziers, a\nshort man with a very large hat.\n“Brightlord?” the interpreter asked at a word from the vizier.\n“I…” Dalinar could feel it. “Something’s wrong.”\n“Dalinar?” Fen asked. “What are you talking about?”\nSpanreeds suddenly started blinking throughout the room. A dozen\nflashing rubies. Dalinar’s heart sidestepped. Anticipationspren rose around\nhim, streamers whipping from the ground, as the various scribes grabbed\nthe blinking spanreeds from boxes or belts and set them out to begin\nwriting.\nJasnah didn’t notice that one of hers was blinking. She was too distracted\nby what she and Navani were reading.\n“The Everstorm just hit Shinovar,” Queen Fen finally explained, reading\nover a scribe’s shoulder.\n“Impossible!” Ialai Sadeas said. “It has only been five days since the last\none! They come at nine-day intervals.”\n“Yes, well, I think we have enough confirmation,” Fen said, nodding\ntoward the spanreeds.\n“The storm is too new,” Teshav said. She pulled her shawl closer as she\nread. “We don’t know it well enough to truly judge its patterns. The reports\nfrom Steen say it is particularly violent this time, moving faster than\nbefore.”\nDalinar felt cold.\n“How long until it reaches us?” Fen asked.\n“Hours yet,” Teshav said. “It can take a full day for the highstorm to get\nfrom one side of Roshar to the other, and the Everstorm is slower. Usually.”\n“It’s moving faster though,” Yanagawn said through his interpreter.\n“How far away are our ships? How are we going to shelter them?”\n“Peace, Your Excellency,” Fen said. “The ships are close, and the new\ndocks miles farther along the coast are sheltered from both east and west.\nWe merely need to make sure the fleet goes directly there, instead of\nstopping here to drop off troops.”\nThe room buzzed with conversations as the various groups received\nreports from their contacts in Tashikk, who in turn would be relaying"

The others\nagreed, distracted, and separated into groups scattered about the room.\nDalinar settled back in his seat, releasing a held breath. “That wasn’t so bad.\nWe can deal with this.”\nThat wasn’t it, the Stormfather said. He rumbled, his concerned voice\ngrowing very soft as he continued, There’s more.\nDalinar jumped back to his feet, instincts prompting him to thrust his\nhand to the side, fingers splayed, to summon a Blade he no longer\npossessed. Bridge Four responded immediately, dropping food from the\ntable of victuals, grabbing spears. Nobody else seemed to notice.\nBut … notice what? No attack came. Conversations continued on all\nsides. Jasnah and Navani were still huddled side by side, reading. Navani\ngasped softly, safehand going to her mouth. Jasnah looked at Dalinar, lips\ndrawn to a line.\nTheir message wasn’t about the storm, Dalinar thought, pulling his chair\nover to them. “All right,” he whispered, though they were far enough from\nother groups to have some privacy. “What is it?”\n“A breakthrough was made in translating the Dawnchant,” Navani\nwhispered. “Teams in Kharbranth and the monasteries of Jah Keved have\narrived at the news separately, using the seed we provided through the\nvisions. We are finally receiving translations.”\n“That’s good, right?” Dalinar said.\nJasnah sighed. “Uncle, the piece that historians have been most eager to\ntranslate is called the Eila Stele. Other sources claim it is old, perhaps the\noldest document in written memory, said to be scribed by the Heralds\nthemselves. From the translation that finally came in today, the carving\nappears to be the account of someone who witnessed the very first coming\nof the Voidbringers, long, long ago. Even before the first Desolation.”\n“Blood of my fathers,” Dalinar said. Before the first Desolation? The last\nDesolation had happened more than four thousand years ago. They were\nspeaking of events lost to time. “And … we can read it?”\n“ ‘They came from another world,’ ” Navani said, reading from her\nsheet. “ ‘Using powers that we have been forbidden to touch. Dangerous\npowers, of spren and Surges. They destroyed their lands and have come to\nus begging.\n“ ‘We took them in, as commanded by the gods. What else could we do?\nThey were a people forlorn, without home. Our pity destroyed us. For their\nbetrayal extended even to our gods: to spren, stone, and wind.\n“ ‘Beware the otherworlders. The traitors. Those with tongues of\nsweetness, but with minds that lust for blood. Do not take them in. Do not\ngive them succor. Well were they named Voidbringers, for they brought the\nvoid.

They look soft, with no shell, but they are\nhard. They have but one heart, and it cannot ever live.’ ”\nShe lowered the page.\nDalinar frowned. It’s nonsense, he thought. Is it claiming that the first\nparshmen who came to invade had no carapace? But how would the writer\nknow that parshmen should have carapace? And what is this about songs.…\nIt clicked. “That was not written by a human,” Dalinar whispered.\n“No, Uncle,” Jasnah said softly. “The writer was a Dawnsinger, one of\nthe original inhabitants of Roshar. The Dawnsingers weren’t spren, as\ntheology has often postulated. Nor were they Heralds. They were parshmen.\nAnd the people they welcomed to their world, the otherworlders…”\n“Were us,” Dalinar whispered. He felt cold, like he’d been dunked in icy\nwater. “They named us Voidbringers.”\nJasnah sighed. “I have suspected this for a time. The first Desolation was\nthe invasion of humankind onto Roshar. We came here and seized this land\nfrom the parshmen—after we accidentally used Surgebinding to destroy our\nprevious world. That is the truth that destroyed the Radiants.”\nThe Stormfather rumbled in his mind. Dalinar stared at that sheet of\npaper in Navani’s hand. Such a small, seemingly unimportant object to have\ncreated such a pit inside of him.\nIt’s true, isn’t it? he thought at the Stormfather. Storms … we’re not the\ndefenders of our homeland.\nWe’re the invaders.\nNearby, Taravangian argued softly with his scribes, then finally stood up.\nHe cleared his throat, and the various groups slowly stilled. The Azish\ncontingent had servants pull their chairs back toward the group, and Queen\nFen returned to her place, though she didn’t sit. She stood, arms folded,\nlooking perturbed.\n“I have had disconcerting news,” Taravangian said. “Over the spanreed,\njust now. It involves Brightlord Kholin. I don’t wish to be objectionable…”\n“No,” Fen said. “I’ve heard it too. I’m going to need an explanation.”\n“Agreed,” Noura said.\nDalinar stood up. “I realize this is troubling. I … I haven’t had time to\nadjust. Perhaps we could adjourn and worry about the storm first? We can\ndiscuss this later.”\n“Perhaps,” Taravangian said. “Yes, perhaps. But it is a problem. We have\nbelieved that ours is a righteous war, but this news of mankind’s origins has\nme disconcerted.”\n“What are you talking about?” Fen said.\n“The news from the Veden translators? Ancient texts, manifesting that\nhumans came from another world?”\n“Bah,” Fen said. “Dusty books and ideas for philosophers. What I want\nto know about is this highking business!”\n“Highking?” Yanagawn asked through an interpreter.\n“I’ve an essay,” Fen said, slapping papers against her hand, “from Zetah"

We have prepared an explanation for you all,\nand our highprinces can confirm that we are not looking to expand our\ninfluence to your nations.”\n“And this?” Noura said, holding up some pages. “Were you preparing an\nexplanation for this as well?”\n“What is that?” Dalinar asked, bracing himself.\n“Accounts of two visions,” Noura said, “that you didn’t share with us. In\nwhich you supposedly met and fraternized with a being known as Odium.”\nBehind Dalinar, Lift gasped. He glanced toward her, and the men of\nBridge Four, who were muttering among themselves.\nThis is bad, Dalinar thought. Too much. Too fast for me to control.\nJasnah leaped to her feet. “This is obviously a concentrated attempt to\ndestroy our reputation. Someone deliberately released all this information at\nthe same time.”\n“Is it true?” Noura asked in Alethi. “Dalinar Kholin, have you met with\nour enemy?”\nNavani gripped his arm. Jasnah subtly shook her head: Don’t answer\nthat.\n“Yes,” Dalinar said.\n“Did he,” Noura asked pointedly, “tell you you’d destroy Roshar?”\n“What of this ancient record?” Taravangian said. “It claims that the\nRadiants already destroyed one world. Is that not what caused them to\ndisband? They worried that their powers could not be controlled!”\n“I’m still trying to wrap my mind around this highking nonsense,” Fen\nsaid. “How is it merely an ‘internal Alethi matter’ if you’ve allowed another\nking to swear to you?”\nEveryone started talking at once. Navani and Jasnah stepped forward,\nresponding to the attacks, but Dalinar only sank into his seat. It was all\nfalling apart. A sword, as keen as any on a battlefield, had been rammed into\nthe heart of his coalition.\nThis is what you feared, he thought. A world that turns not upon force of\narmies, but upon the concerns of scribes and bureaucrats.\nAnd in that world, he had just been deftly outflanked.\n112.

Though\nshe was a hundred percent Alethi, she preferred dresses of an old-fashioned\nThaylen style, which had an apronlike front with straps over the shoulders\nand skirts that ended right below the knee. She’d wear a buttoned shirt\nunderneath, often in a bright color—brighter than most darkeyes could\nafford. Tarah knew how to squeeze the most out of her spheres.\nThat day, Kaladin had been sitting on a stump, shirt off, sweating. The\nevening was growing cold as the sun set, and he basked in the last warmth.\nHis spear resting across his lap, he toyed with a rock of white, brown, and\nblack. Alternating colors.\nThe warmth from the sun was mirrored as someone warm hugged him\nfrom behind, wrapping her arms across his chest. Kaladin rested a callused\nhand on Tarah’s smooth one, drinking in her scent—of starched uniforms,\nnew leather, and other clean things.\n“You’re done early,” he said. “I thought there were greenvines to outfit\ntoday.”\n“I have the new girl doing the rest.”\n“I’m surprised. I know how much you like this part.”\n“Storms,” she said, slipping around in front of him. “They get so\nembarrassed when you measure them. ‘Hold on, kid. I’m not making a pass\nat you because I’m putting a measuring tape up against your chest, I\nswear.…’ ” She lifted his spear, looking it over with a critical eye, testing\nthe balance. “I wish you’d let me requisition a new one for you.”\n“I like that one. Took me forever to find one long enough.”\nShe peered along the length of the weapon, to make sure it was straight.\nShe would never trust it, as she hadn’t personally requisitioned it for him.\nShe wore green today, under a brown skirt, her black hair tied back in a tail.\nSlightly plump, with a round face and firm build, Tarah’s beauty was a\nsubtle thing. Like an uncut gemstone. The more you saw of it—the more\nyou discovered of its natural facets—the more you loved it. Until one day it\nstruck you that you’d never known anything as wonderful.\n“Any young boys among the greenvines?” Kaladin asked, standing up\nand pocketing Tien’s stone.\n“I didn’t notice.”\nHe grunted, waving to Gol—one of the other squadleaders. “You know I\nlike to watch for kids who might need a little extra looking out for.”\n“I know, but I was busy. We got a caravan from Kholinar today.” She\nleaned close to him. “There was real flour in one of the packages. I traded in\nsome favors. You know I’ve been wanting you to try some of my father’s\nThaylen bread? I thought maybe we’d fix it tonight.”\n“Your father hates me.”\n“He’s coming around. Besides, he loves anyone who compliments his\nbread.”\n“I have evening practice.”\n“You just got done practicing.”\n“I just got done warming up.” He looked to her, then grimaced. “I\norganized the evening practice, Tarah. I can’t just skip it. Besides, I thought"

Besides, I thought\nyou were going to be busy all evening. Maybe tomorrow, lunch?”\nHe kissed her on the cheek and reclaimed his spear. He’d taken only a\nstep away when she spoke.\n“I’m leaving, Kal,” she said from behind.\nHe stumbled over his own feet, then spun about. “What?”\n“I’m transferring,” she said. “They offered me a scribe’s job in Mourn’s\nVault, with the highprince’s house. It’s a good opportunity, particularly for\nsomeone like me.”\n“But…” He gaped. “Leaving?”\n“I wanted to tell you over dinner, not out here in the cold. It’s something\nI have to do. Father’s getting older; he’s worried he’ll end up being shipped\nto the Shattered Plains. If I can get work, he can join me.”\nKaladin put a hand to his head. She couldn’t just leave, could she?\nTarah walked over, stood on the tips of her toes, and kissed him lightly\non the lips.\n“Could you … not go?” he asked.\nShe shook her head.\n“Maybe I could get a transfer?” he said. “To the highprince’s standing\nhouse guard?”\n“Would you do that?”\n“I…”\nNo. He wouldn’t.\nNot while he carried that stone in his pocket, not while the memory of\nhis brother dying was fresh in his mind. Not while lighteyed highlords got\nboys killed in petty fights.\n“Oh, Kal,” she whispered, then squeezed his arm. “Maybe someday\nyou’ll learn how to be there for the living, not just for the dead.”\nAfter she left, he got two letters from her, talking about her life in\nMourn’s Vault. He had paid someone to read them to him.\nHe never sent responses. Because he was stupid, because he didn’t\nunderstand. Because men make mistakes when they’re young and angry.\nBecause she had been right.\n* * *\nKaladin shouldered his harpoon, leading his companions through the\nstrange forest. They’d flown part of the way, but needed to conserve what\nlittle Stormlight they had left.\nSo, they’d spent the last two days hiking. Trees and more trees, lifespren\nfloating among them, the occasional bobbing souls of fish. Syl kept saying\nthat they were lucky they hadn’t encountered any angerspren or other\npredators. To her, this forest was strangely silent, strangely empty.\nThe jungle-style trees had given way to taller, more statuesque ones with\ndeep crimson trunks and limbs like burnt-red crystals that, at the ends, burst\ninto small collections of minerals. The rugged obsidian landscape was full\nof deep valleys and endless towering hills. Kaladin was beginning to worry\nthat—despite the motionless sun to provide an unerring way to gauge their\nheading—they were going in the wrong direction.\n“Storms, bridgeboy,” Adolin said, hiking up the incline after him.\n“Maybe a break?”\n“At the top,” Kaladin said.\nWithout Stormlight, Shallan trailed farthest behind, Pattern at her side.\nExhaustionspren circled in the air above, like large chickens.

Though she\ntried to push herself, she wasn’t a soldier, and often was the biggest\nlimitation to their pace. Of course, without her mapmaking skills and\nmemory of Thaylen City’s exact location, they probably wouldn’t have any\nidea which way to go.\nFortunately, there was no sign of pursuit. Still, Kaladin couldn’t help\nworrying that they were moving too slowly.\nBe there, Tarah had told him. For the living.\nHe urged them up this hillside, past a section of broken ground, where\nthe obsidian had fractured like layers of crem that hadn’t hardened properly.\nWorry pulled him forward. Step after relentless step.\nHe had to get to the Oathgate. He would not fail like he had in Kholinar.\nA single glowing windspren burst alight next to him as he reached the\ntop of the hill. Cresting it, he found himself overlooking a sea of souls.\nThousands upon thousands of candle flames bobbed about in the next valley\nover, moving above a grand ocean of glass beads.\nThaylen City.\nAdolin joined him, then finally Shallan and the three spren. Shallan\nsighed and settled to the ground, coughing softly from the effort of the\nclimb.\nAmid the sea of lights were two towering spren, much like the ones\nthey’d seen in Kholinar. One sparkled a multitude of colors while the other\nshimmered an oily black. Both stood tall, holding spears as long as a\nbuilding. The sentries of the Oathgate, and they didn’t look corrupted.\nBeneath them, the device itself manifested as a large stone platform with\na wide, sweeping white bridge running over the beads and to the shore.\nThat bridge was guarded by an entire army of enemy spren, hundreds—\nperhaps thousands—strong.\n113. The Thing Men Do Best\nIf I’m correct and my research true, then the question remains. Who is\nthe ninth Unmade? Is it truly Dai-Gonarthis? If so, could their actions\nhave actually caused the complete destruction of Aimia?\n—From Hessi’s Mythica, page 307\nDalinar stood alone in the rooms Queen Fen had given him, staring out the\nwindow, looking west.

Taravangian said that a king\nwas justified in doing terrible things in the name of the state. But Dalinar …\nFor once, he’d assumed what he was doing was right.\nDid you really think you belonged here? the Stormfather asked. That you\nwere native to Roshar?\n“Yes, maybe,” Dalinar said. “I thought … maybe we came from\nShinovar originally.”\nThat is the land you were given, the Stormfather said. A place where the\nplants and animals you brought here could grow.\n“We weren’t able to confine ourselves to what we were given.”\nWhen has any man ever been content with what he has?\n“When has any tyrant ever said to himself, ‘This is enough’?” Dalinar\nwhispered, remembering words Gavilar had once spoken.\nThe Stormfather rumbled.\n“The Almighty kept this from his Radiants,” Dalinar said. “When they\ndiscovered it, they abandoned their vows.”\nIt is more than that. My memory of all this is … strange. First, I was not\nfully awake; I was but the spren of a storm. Then I was like a child.\nChanged and shaped during the frantic last days of a dying god.\nBut I do remember. It was not only the truth of humankind’s origin that\ncaused the Recreance. It was the distinct, powerful fear that they would\ndestroy this world, as men like them had destroyed the one before. The\nRadiants abandoned their vows for that reason, as will you.\n“I will not,” Dalinar said. “I won’t let my Radiants retread the fate of\ntheir predecessors.”\nWon’t you?\nDalinar’s attention was drawn to a solemn group of men leaving the\ntemple below. Bridge Four, spears held on slumped shoulders, heads bowed\nas they quietly marched down the steps.\nDalinar scrambled out of his villa and ran down the steps to intercept the\nbridgemen. “Where are you going?” he demanded.\nThey halted, falling into ranks at attention.\n“Sir,” Teft said. “We thought we’d head back to Urithiru. We left some\nof the men behind, and they deserve to know about this business with the\nancient Radiants.”\n“What we’ve discovered doesn’t change the fact that we are being\ninvaded,” Dalinar said.\n“Invaded by people trying to reclaim their homeland,” Sigzil said.\n“Storms. I’d be mad too.”\n“We’re supposed to be the good guys, you know?” Leyten said.\n“Fighting for a good cause, for once in our storming lives.”\nEchoes of his own thoughts.

That pain hid behind the rest,\ntaunting him.\nThe bridgemen gave Dalinar their unique cross-armed salute, then left\nwithout waiting to be dismissed.\nIn the past, Honor was able to guard against this, the Stormfather told\nhim. He convinced the Radiants they were righteous, even if this land hadn’t\noriginally been theirs. Who cares what your ancestors did, when the enemy\nis trying to kill you right now?\nBut in the days leading to the Recreance, Honor was dying. When that\ngeneration of knights learned the truth, Honor did not support them. He\nraved, speaking of the Dawnshards, ancient weapons used to destroy the\nTranquiline Halls. Honor … promised that Surgebinders would do the same\nto Roshar.\n“Odium claimed the same thing.”\nHe can see the future, though only cloudily. Regardless, I … understand\nnow as I never did before.

You have cursed me,\nhuman, with this capacity.\nThe meeting in the temple seemed to be breaking up. The Azish\ncontingent started down the steps.\n“Our enemy hasn’t changed,” Dalinar said to them. “The need for a\ncoalition is as strong as ever.”\nThe young emperor, being carried in a palanquin, didn’t look at him.\nOddly, the Azish didn’t make for the Oathgate, instead taking a path down\ninto the city.\nOnly Vizier Noura idled to speak to him. “Jasnah Kholin might be right,”\nshe said in Azish. “The destruction of our old world, your secret visions,\nthis business with you being highking—it seems too great a coincidence for\nit all to come at once.”\n“Then you can see that we’re being manipulated.”\n“Manipulated by the truth, Kholin,” she said, meeting his eyes. “That\nOathgate is dangerous. These powers of yours are dangerous. Deny it.”\n“I cannot.

I fear I can no longer fight beside you.”\n“Why?” Dalinar said. “Taravangian, you’re the most pragmatic ruler I’ve\nmet!

        "text": "stone hermitage she’d been given outside Kholinar. Her new dwelling was\neven more austere, with only a single blanket for sleeping, and a simple\ncookfire upon which she prepared fish the crowds brought her.\nShe was growing dirty, rough. That was what the Fused seemed to want:\na hermit living in the wilds. Apparently that was more convincing for the\nlocal crowds they brought to listen to her—most of whom were former\nThaylen slaves. She was instructed to speak of “Passion” and emotion more\noften than she had in Alethkar.\n“My people are dead now,” Venli said to Destruction, repeating the now-\nfamiliar speech. “They fell in that last assault, singing as they drew the\nstorm. I remain, but my people’s work is done.”\nThose words hurt. Her people couldn’t be completely gone … could\nthey?\n“The day now belongs to your Passion,” she continued to Command.\n“We had named ourselves ‘listeners’ because of the songs we heard. These\nare your heritage, but you are not to just listen, but sing. Adopt the rhythms\nand Passions of your ancestors! You must sail to battle. For the future, for\nyour children! And for us. Those who died that you might exist.”\nShe turned away, as instructed that she do after the end of each speech.\nShe wasn’t allowed to answer questions any longer, not since she’d talked\nwith some of these singers about the specific history of her people. It made\nher wonder. Did the Fused and the Voidspren fear the heritage of her\npeople, even as they used her for their purposes? Or did they not trust her\nfor other reasons?\nShe put her hand to her pouch. Odium didn’t seem to know that she’d\nbeen in that vision with Dalinar Kholin. Behind, a Voidspren led the\nThaylen singers away. Venli moved toward her cave, but then hesitated. A\nFused sat on the rocks just above the opening.\n“Ancient One?” she asked.\nHe grinned at her and giggled.\nAnother one of those.\nShe started into the cave, but he dropped and seized her under the arms,\nthen carried her into the sky. Venli prevented herself—with difficulty—from\ntrying to batter him away. The Fused never touched her, not even the crazy\nones, without orders. Indeed, this one flew her down to one of the many\nships at the harbor, where Rine—the tall Fused who had accompanied her\nduring her first days preaching in Alethkar—stood at the prow. He glanced\ntoward her as she was landed—roughly—on the deck.\nShe hummed to Conceit at her treatment.\nHe hummed to Spite. A small acknowledgment of a wrong done, the best\nshe’d get out of him, so she hummed to Satisfaction in response.\n“Ancient One?” she asked to Craving.\n“You are to accompany us as we sail,” he said to Command. “You may\nwash yourself in the cabin as we go, if you wish. There is water.”\nVenli hummed to Craving and looked toward the main cabin. Craving\nslipped into Abashment as she considered the sheer size of the fleet that was\nlaunching around her. Hundreds of ships, which must have been filled with\nthousands of singers, were sailing from coves all along the coast. They"

They\ndotted the seas like rockbuds on the plains.\n“Now?” she asked to Abashment. “I wasn’t prepared! I didn’t know!”\n“You may wish to grab hold of something. The storm will soon arrive.”\nShe looked to the west. A storm? She hummed to Craving again.\n“Ask,” Rine said to Command.\n“I can easily see the strength of the grand assault force we’ve gathered.\nBut … why do we need such? Are not the Fused enough of an army\nthemselves?”\n“Cowardice?” he asked to Derision. “You do not wish to fight?”\n“I simply seek to understand.”\nRine changed to a new rhythm, one she rarely heard. The Rhythm of\nWithdrawal—one of the only new rhythms that had a calm tone. “The\nstrongest and most skilled of our number have yet to awaken—but even if\nwe were all awake, we would not fight this war alone. This world will not\nbe ours; we fight to give it to you, our descendants. When it is won, our\nvengeance taken and our homeland secured at long last, we will sleep.\nFinally.”\nHe then pointed at the cabin. “Go prepare. We will sail swiftly, with\nOdium’s own storm to guide us.”\nAs if in agreement with his words, red lightning flashed on the western\nhorizon.\nI-13. Rysn\nRysn was bored.\nOnce she’d walked to the farthest reaches of Roshar, trading with the\nisolationist Shin. Once she’d sailed with her babsk to Icewater and cut a\ndeal with pirates. Once she’d climbed Reshi greatshells, which were as\nlarge as towns.\nNow she kept Queen Fen’s ledgers.\nIt was a good job, with an office in the Thaylen Gemstone Reserve.\nVstim—her former babsk—had traded favors to get her the job. Her\napprenticeship finished, she was a free woman. No longer a student. Now a\nmaster.\nOf boredom.\nShe sat in her chair, doodling at the edges of a Liaforan word puzzle.\nRysn could balance while sitting, though she couldn’t feel her legs and\nembarrassingly couldn’t control certain bodily functions. She had to rely\nupon her porters to move her.\nCareer, over. Freedom, over. Life, over.\nShe sighed and pushed away her word puzzle. Time to get back to work.\nHer duties included annotating the queen’s pending mercantile contracts\nwith references to previous ones, keeping the queen’s personal vault in the\nGemstone Reserve, preparing weekly expenditure reports, and accounting\nthe queen’s salary as a portion of taxable income from various Thaylen\ninterests at home and abroad.\nWheeeeeeeee.\nShe had an audit today, which had prevented her from attending Fen’s\nmeeting with the monarchs. She might have enjoyed seeing the Blackthorn\nand the Azish emperor. Well, the other aides would bring her word once the\nmeeting was through.

She’d originally hung souvenirs from\nher years traveling, but those had reminded her of a life she could no longer\nhave. A life full of promise. A life that had ended when she’d stupidly fallen\nfrom the head of a greatshell, and landed here, in this cripple’s chair. Now,\nthe only memento she kept was a single pot of Shin grass.\nWell, that and the little creature sleeping among the blades. Chiri-Chiri\nbreathed softly, rippling the too-dumb grass, which didn’t pull into burrows.\nIt grew in something called soil, which was like crem that never hardened.\nChiri-Chiri herself was a small winged beast a little longer than Rysn’s\noutstretched palm. The Reshi named her a larkin, and though she was the\nsize of a large cremling, she had the snout, carapace, and build of a creature\nfar more grand. An axehound, perhaps, with wings. A lithe little flying\npredator—though, for all her dangerous appearance, she sure did like to\nnap.\nAs Rysn worked, Chiri-Chiri finally stirred and peeked out from the\ngrass, then made a series of clicking sounds with her jaw. She climbed\ndown onto the desk and eyed the diamond mark Rysn was using for light.\n“No,” Rysn said, double-checking numbers in her ledger.\nChiri-Chiri clicked again, slinking toward the gem.\n“You just ate,” Rysn said, then used her palm to shoo the larkin back. “I\nneed that for light.”\nChiri-Chiri clicked in annoyance, then flew—wings beating very quickly\n—to the upper reaches of the room, where she settled onto one of her\nfavorite perches, the lintel above the doorway.\nA short time later, a knock at the door interrupted Rysn’s tedium.\n“Come,” she said. Her man, Wmlak—who was half assistant, half porter—\npoked his head in.\n“Let me guess,” Rysn said, “the auditor is early.” They always were.\n“Yes, but…”\nBehind Wmlak, Rysn caught sight of a familiar flat-topped, conical hat.\nWmlak stepped back and gestured toward an old man in blue and red robes,\nhis Thaylen eyebrows tucked behind his ears. Spry for a man past his\nseventieth year, Vstim had a wise but unyielding way about him.\nInoffensively calculating. He carried a small box under his arm.\nRysn gasped in delight; once, she would have leaped to her feet to\nembrace him. Now she could only sit there and gape. “But you were off to\ntrade in New Natanan!”\n“The seas are not safe these days,” Vstim said. “And the queen requested\nmy aid in difficult negotiations with the Alethi. I have returned, with some\nreluctance, to accept an appointment from Her Majesty.”\nAn appointment …\n“In the government?” Rysn asked.\n“Minister of trade, and royal liaison to the guild of shipping merchants.”\nRysn could only gape further.

That was the highest civilian appointment\nin the kingdom. “But … Babsk, you’ll have to live in Thaylen City!”\n“Well, I am feeling my age these days.”\n“Nonsense. You’re as lively as I am.” Rysn glanced at her legs. “More.”\n“Not so lively that I wouldn’t mind a seat…”\nShe realized he was still standing in the doorway to her office. Even all\nthese months after her accident, she pushed with her arms as if to spring up\nand fetch him a seat. Idiot.\n“Please, sit!” she said, waving toward the room’s other chair. He settled\ndown and placed his box on the table while she twisted to do something to\nwelcome him, leaning over—precariously—to get the teapot. The tea was\ncold, unfortunately. Chiri-Chiri had drained the gemstone in her fabrial\nhotplate.\n“I can’t believe you’d agree to settle down!” she said, handing him a\ncup.\n“Some would say that the opportunity offered me is far too important to\nrefuse.”\n“Storm that,” Rysn said. “Staying in one city will wilt you—you’ll spend\nyour days doing paperwork and being bored.”\n“Rysn,” he said, taking her hand. “Child.”\nShe looked away. Chiri-Chiri flew down and landed on her head,\nclicking angrily at Vstim.\n“I promise I’m not going to hurt her,” the old man said, grinning and\nreleasing Rysn’s hand. “Here, I brought you something. See?” He held up a\nruby chip.\nChiri-Chiri considered, then hovered down above his hand—not\ntouching it—and sucked the Stormlight out. It flew to her in a little stream,\nand she clicked happily, then zipped over to the pot of grass and wriggled\ninto it, peeking out at Vstim.\n“You still have the grass, I see,” he said.\n“You ordered me to keep it.”\n“You’re now a master merchant, Rysn! You needn’t obey the orders of a\ndoddering old man.”\nThe grass rustled as Chiri-Chiri shifted. She was too big to hide in it,\nthough that never stopped her from trying.\n“Chiri-Chiri likes it,” Rysn said. “Maybe because it can’t move. Kind of\nlike me…”\n“Have you tried that Radiant who—”\n“Yes. He can’t heal my legs. It’s been too long since my accident, which\nis appropriate. This is my consequence—payment for a contract I entered\ninto willingly the moment I climbed down the side of that greatshell.”\n“You don’t have to lock yourself away, Rysn.”\n“This is a good job. You yourself got it for me.”\n“Because you refused to go on further trading expeditions!”\n“What good would I be? One must trade from a position of power,\nsomething I can never do again. Besides, an exotic goods merchant who\ncan’t walk? You know how much hiking is required.”\nVstim took her hand again. “I thought you were frightened. I thought\nyou wanted something safe and secure.

But I’ve been listening. Hmalka has\ntold me—”\n“You spoke to my superior?”\n“People talk.”\n“My work has been exemplary,” Rysn said.\n“It isn’t your work she’s worried about.” He turned and brushed the\ngrass, drawing Chiri-Chiri’s attention to his hand. She narrowed her eyes at\nit. “Do you remember what I told you, when you cut out that grass?”\n“That I was to keep it. Until it no longer seemed odd.”\n“You’ve always been so quick to make assumptions. About yourself,\nnow, more than others. Here, perhaps this will … anyway, have a look.”\nVstim handed her the box.\nShe frowned, then slid off the wooden lid. Inside was a wound-up cord\nof white rope. Beside that, a slip of paper? Rysn took out the sheet, reading\nit.\n“A deed of ownership?” she whispered. “To a ship?”\n“Brand new,” Vstim said. “A three-masted frigate, the largest I’ve ever\nowned—with fabrial stabilizers for storms, of the finest Thaylen\nengineering. I had her built in the shipyards of Klna City, which luckily\nsheltered her from both storms. While I’ve given the rest of my fleet—\nwhat’s left of it—to the queen for use against the invasion, this one I\nreserved.”\n“Wandersail,” Rysn said, reading the ship’s name. “Babsk, you are a\nromantic. Don’t tell me you believe that old story?”\n“One can believe in a story without believing it happened.” He smiled.\n“Whose rules are you following, Rysn? Who is forcing you to stay here?\nTake the ship. Go! I wish to fund your initial trade run, as an investment.\nAfter that, you’ll have to do well to maintain a vessel of this size!”\nRysn recognized the white rope now. It was a captain’s cord some twenty\nfeet long, used as a traditional Thaylen mark of ownership. She’d wrap it in\nher colors and string it in the rigging of her ship.\nIt was a gift worth a fortune.\n“I can’t take this,” she said, putting the box on the desk. “I’m sorry. I—”\nHe pushed the cord into her hands. “Just think about it, Rysn. Humor an\nold man who can no longer travel.”\nShe held the rope and found her eyes watering. “Bother. Babsk, I have an\nauditor coming today! I need to be composed and ready to account the\nqueen’s vault!”\n“Fortunately, the auditor is an old friend who has seen much worse from\nyou than a few tears.”\n“… But you’re the minister of trade!”\n“They were going to make me go to a stuffy meeting with old Kholin\nand his soldiers,” Vstim said, leaning in, “but I insisted on coming to do\nthis. I’ve always wanted to see the queen’s vault in person.”\nRysn wiped her tears, trying to recover some of her decorum. “Well, let’s\nbe to it then. I assure you, everything is in order.”\n* * *"

I assure you, everything is in order.”\n* * *\nThe Sphere Vault’s thick steel door required three numbers to open, each\nrolled into a different dial, in three separate rooms. Rysn and other scribes\nknew one number, the door guards protected another, and an auditor—like\nVstim—was typically given a third by the queen or the minister of the\ntreasury. All were changed at random intervals.\nRysn knew for a fact that this was mostly for show. In a world of\nShardblades, the real defense of the vault was in the layers of guards who\nsurrounded the building, and—more importantly—in the careful auditing of\nits contents. Though novels were full of stories of the vault being robbed,\nthe only real thefts had occurred through embezzlement.\nRysn moved her dial to the proper number, then pulled the lever in her\nroom. The vault door finally opened with a resounding thump, and she\nscrambled her dial and called for Wmlak. Her porter entered, then pushed\ndown on the back handles of her chair, lifting the front legs so he could\nwheel it out to meet the others.\nVstim stood by the now-open vault door with several soldiers. Today’s\ninner door guard—Tlik—stood with crossbow at the ready, barring entry.\nThere was a slot that let the men stationed in the vault communicate with\nthose outside, but the door couldn’t be opened from within.\n“Scheduled accounting of the queen’s personal vault,” Rysn said to him.\n“Daily passcode: lockstep.”\nTlik nodded, stepping back and lowering his crossbow. Vstim entered\nwith ledger in hand, trailed by a member of the Queen’s Guard: a rough-\nlooking man with a shaved head and spiked eyebrows. Once they were in,\nWmlak wheeled Rysn through the vault door, down a short corridor, and\ninto a little alcove, where another guard—Fladm, today—waited.\nHer porter brushed off his hands, then nodded to her and retreated. Tlik\nshut the vault door after him, the metal making a deep thump as it locked\ninto place. The inner vault guards didn’t like anyone coming in who wasn’t\nspecifically authorized—and that included her servant. She’d have to rely\non the guards to move her now—but unfortunately, her large wheeled chair\nwas too bulky to fit between the rows of shelves in the main vault.\nRysn felt a healthy dose of shame in front of her former babsk as she was\ntaken—like a sack of roots—from her chair with rear wheels to a smaller\nchair with poles along the sides. Being carried was the most humiliating\npart.\nThe guards left her usual chair in the alcove, near the steps down to the\nlower level. Then, Tlik and the guardsman the queen had sent—Rysn didn’t\nknow his name—took the poles and carried her into the main vault\nchamber.\nEven here, in this job where she sat most of the time, her inability was a\nhuge inconvenience. Her embarrassment was exacerbated as Chiri-Chiri—\nwho wasn’t allowed in the vault for practical reasons—flitted by in a buzz\nof wings. How had she gotten in?"

        "text": "huge inconvenience. Her embarrassment was exacerbated as Chiri-Chiri—\nwho wasn’t allowed in the vault for practical reasons—flitted by in a buzz\nof wings. How had she gotten in?\nTlik chuckled, but Rysn only sighed.\nThe main vault chamber was filled with metal racks, like bookcases,\ncontaining display boxes of gemstones. It smelled stale. Of a place that\nnever changed, and was never intended to change.\nThe guards carried her down one of the narrow rows, light from spheres\ntied to their belts providing the only illumination. Rysn carried the captain’s\nrope in her lap, and fingered it with one hand. Surely she couldn’t take this\noffer. It was too generous. Too incredible.\nToo difficult.\n“So dark!” Vstim said. “A room full of a million gemstones, and it’s\ndark?”\n“Most gems never leave,” Rysn said. “The personal merchant vaults are\non the lower level, and there’s some light to those, with the spheres\neveryone has been bringing lately. These, though … they’re always here.”\nPossession of these gems changed frequently, but it was all done with\nnumbers in a ledger. It was a quirk of the Thaylen system of underwriting\ntrades; as long as everyone was confident that these gemstones were here,\nlarge sums could change hands without risk of anything being stolen.\nEach gemstone was carefully annotated with numbers inscribed both on\na plate glued to its bottom and on the rack that held it. Those numbers were\nwhat people bought and sold—Rysn was shocked by how few people\nactually asked to come down and view the thing they were trading to own.\n“0013017-36!” Vstim said. “The Benval Diamond! I owned that way\nback when. Memorized the number even. Huh. You know, it’s smaller than I\nthought it would be.”\nShe and the two guards led Vstim to the back wall, which held a series of\nsmaller metal vault doors. The main vault behind them was silent; no other\nscribes were working today, though Chiri-Chiri did flit past. She hovered\ndown toward the queen’s guardsman—eyeing the spheres on his belt—but\nRysn snatched her from the air.\nChiri-Chiri griped, buzzing her wings against Rysn’s hand and clicking.\nRysn blushed, but held tight. “Sorry.”\n“Must be like a buffet for her down here!” Tlik said.\n“A buffet of empty plates,” Rysn said. “Keep an eye on your belt, Tlik.”\nThe two guards set her chair down near a specific vault. With her free\nhand, Rysn dug a key from her pocket and handed it to Vstim. “Go ahead.\nVault Thirteen.”\nVstim unlocked and swung open the smaller vault-within-the-vault,\nwhich was roughly the size of a closet.\nLight poured from it.\nThe shelves inside were filled with gemstones, spheres, jewelry, and\neven some mundane objects like letters and an old knife. But the most\nstunning item in the collection was obviously the large ruby on the center\nshelf. The size of a child’s head, it glowed brightly.\nThe King’s Drop.

The light shone with such brilliance\nthat the room seemed almost to be in daylight, though shaded bloodred by\nthe gemstone’s color.\n“Amazing,” Vstim whispered.\n“As far as scholars can tell,” Rysn said, “the King’s Drop never loses its\nStormlight. A stone this large should have run out after a month. It’s\nsomething about the crystal lattice, the lack of flaws and imperfections.”\n“They say it’s a chunk off the Stone of Ten Dawns.”\n“Another story?” Rysn said. “You are a romantic.”\nHer former babsk smiled, then placed a cloth shade over the gemstone to\nreduce its glare so it wouldn’t interfere with their work. He opened his\nledger. “Let’s start with the smaller gemstones and work our way up, shall\nwe?”\nRysn nodded.\nThe queen’s guard killed Tlik.\nHe did it with a knife, right into the neck. Tlik dropped without a word,\nthough the sound of the knife being ripped free shocked Rysn. The\ntreacherous guard knocked against her chair, toppling her over as he slashed\nat Vstim.\nThe enemy underestimated the merchant’s spryness. Vstim dodged\nbackward into the queen’s vault, screaming, “Murder! Robbery! Raise the\nalarm!”\nRysn untangled herself from her toppled chair and, panicked, pulled\nherself away by her arms, dragging legs like cordwood. The murderer\nreached into the vault to deal with her babsk, and she heard a grunt.\nA moment later, the traitor stepped out, carrying a large red light in his\nhand. The King’s Drop, shining brightly enough despite its black wrapping\ncloth. Rysn caught a glimpse of Vstim collapsed on the floor inside the\nvault, holding his side.\nThe traitor kicked the door closed—locking the old merchant away. He\nglanced toward her.\nAnd a crossbow bolt hit him.\n“Thief in the vault!” Fladm’s voice said. “Alarm!”\nRysn pulled herself to a row of gemstone racks. Behind her, the thief\ntook a second crossbow bolt, but didn’t seem to notice. How …\nThe thief stepped over and picked up poor Tlik’s crossbow. Footsteps\nand calls indicated that several guards from the lower level had heard\nFladm, and were coming up the steps. The thief fired the crossbow once\ndown a nearby row, and a shout of pain from Fladm indicated it had\nconnected. Another guardsman arrived a second later and attacked the thief\nwith his sword.\nHe should have run for help! Rysn thought as she huddled by the shelf.\nThe thief took a cut along the face from the sword, then set his prize down\nand caught the guard’s arm. The two struggled, and Rysn watched the cut\non the thief’s face reknit.\nHe was healing?

Chiri-Chiri landed on the cloth\ncontaining the enormous ruby.\nNearby, the thief stabbed one of the guards. Rysn winced at the awful\nsight of their struggle, lit by the ruby, then crawled forward—dragging her\nlegs—and snatched the gemstone.\nChiri-Chiri clicked at her in annoyance as Rysn dragged the ruby with\nher around the corner. Another guard screamed. They were dropping\nquickly.\nHave to do something. Can’t just sit here, can I?\nRysn clutched the gemstone and looked down the row between shelves.\nAn impossible distance, hundreds of feet, to the corridor and the exit. The\ndoor was locked, but she could call through the communication slot for\nhelp.\nBut why? If five guards couldn’t handle the thief, what could one\ncrippled woman do?\nMy babsk is locked in the queen’s vault.

Then she started pulling herself along the\nshelves. Chiri-Chiri rode behind on the ruby, and its light dimmed.\nEveryone else was struggling for their lives, but the little larkin was\nfeasting.\nRysn made faster progress than she had expected to, though soon her\narms began to ache. Behind, the fighting stilled, the last guard’s shout\ncutting off.\nRysn redoubled her efforts, pulling herself along toward the exit,\nreaching the alcove where they’d left her chair. Here, she found blood.\nFladm lay at the threshold of the entry corridor, a bolt in him, his own\ncrossbow on the floor beside him. Rysn collapsed a couple of feet from him,\nmuscles burning. Spheres on his belt illuminated her chair and the steps\ndown to the lower vault level. No more help would be coming from down\nthere.\nPast Fladm’s body, the corridor led to the door out. “Help!” she shouted.\n“Thief!”\nShe thought she heard voices on the other side, through the\ncommunication slot. But … it would take the guards outside time to get it\nopen, as they didn’t know all three codes. Maybe that was good. The thief\ncouldn’t get out until they opened it, right?\nOf course, that meant she was trapped inside with him while Vstim\nbled.…\nThe silence from behind haunted her.

What did it matter? Did she think she could\nfight? That man could just heal anyway.\nShe was alone.\nHelpless.\nLive or die. Did she care?\nI …\nYes. Yes, I care! I want to sail my own ship!\nA sudden blur darted out of the darkness and flew around the thief. Chiri-\nChiri moved with blinding speed, hovering about the man, drawing his\nattention.\nRysn frantically placed the crossbow bolt, then took the captain’s cord\noff the ruby’s sack and tied one end to the stirrup at the front of the\ncrossbow. She tied the other end to the back of her heavy wooden chair.\nThat done, she spared a glance for Chiri-Chiri, then hesitated.\nThe larkin was feeding off the thief. A line of light streamed from him,\nbut it was a strange dark violet light. Chiri-Chiri flew about, drawing it from\nthe man, whose face melted away, revealing marbled skin underneath.\nA parshman? Wearing some kind of disguise?\nNo, a Voidbringer. He growled and said something in an unfamiliar\nlanguage, batting at Chiri-Chiri, who buzzed away into the darkness.\nRysn gripped the crossbow tightly with one hand, then with the other she\nshoved her chair down the long stairway.\nIt fell in a clatter, the rope playing out after it. Rysn grabbed on to the\ncrossbow with the other hand. The cord pulled taut as the chair jerked to a\nstop partway down the steps, and she yanked back on the crossbow at the\nsame time, hanging on for all she was worth.\nClick.\nShe cut the rope free with her belt knife. The thief lunged for her, and\nshe twisted—screaming—and pulled the firing lever on the crossbow. She\ndidn’t know how to aim properly, but the thief obligingly loomed over her.\nThe crossbow bolt hit him right in the chin.\nHe dropped and, blessedly, fell still. Whatever power had been healing\nhim was gone, consumed by Chiri-Chiri.\nThe larkin buzzed over and landed on her stomach, clicking happily.\n“Thank you,” Rysn whispered, sweat streaming down the sides of her\nface. “Thank you, thank you.” She hesitated. “Are you … bigger?”\nChiri-Chiri clicked happily.\nVstim. I need the second set of keys."

The Voidbringers had been trying to\nsteal it. Why?\nRysn tossed aside the crossbow, then pulled herself toward the vault\ndoor.\nI-14. Teft\nTeft could function.\nYou learned how to do that. How to cling to the normal parts of your life\nso that people wouldn’t be too worried. So that you wouldn’t be too\nundependable.\nHe stumbled sometimes. That eroded trust, to the point where it was hard\nto keep telling himself that he could handle it. He knew, deep down, that\nhe’d end up alone again. The men of Bridge Four would tire of digging him\nout of trouble.\nBut for now, Teft functioned. He nodded to Malata, who was working\nthe Oathgate, then led his men across the platform and down the ramp\ntoward Urithiru. They were a subdued group. Few grasped the meaning of\nwhat they’d learned, but they all sensed that something had changed.\nMade perfect sense to Teft. It couldn’t be easy, now, could it. Not in his\nstorming life.\nA winding path through corridors and a stairwell led them back toward\ntheir barracks. As they walked, a woman appeared in the hallway beside\nTeft, roughly his height, glowing with soft blue-white light. Storming spren.\nHe pointedly did not look at her.\nYou have Words to speak, Teft, she said in his mind.\n“Storm you,” he muttered.\nYou have started on this path. When will you tell the others the oaths you\nhave sworn?\n“I didn’t—”\nShe turned away from him suddenly, becoming alert, looking down the\ncorridor toward the Bridge Four barracks.\n“What?” Teft stopped. “Something wrong?”\nSomething is very wrong. Run quickly, Teft!\nHe charged out in front of the men, causing them to shout after him. He\nscrambled to the door into their barracks and threw it open.\nThe scent of blood immediately assaulted him. The Bridge Four common\nroom was in shambles, and blood stained the floor. Teft shouted, rushing\nthrough the room to find three corpses near the back. He dropped his spear\nand fell to his knees beside Rock, Bisig, and Eth.\nStill breathing, Teft thought, feeling at Rock’s neck. Still breathing.\nRemember Kaladin’s training, you fool.\n“Check the others!” he shouted as more bridgemen joined him. He\npulled off his coat and used it on Rock’s wounds; the Horneater was sliced\nup good, a half dozen cuts that looked like they’d come from a knife.\n“Bisig’s alive,” Peet called. “Though … storms, that’s a Shardblade\nwound!”\n“Eth…” Lopen said, kneeling beside the third body. “Storms…”\nTeft hesitated. Eth had been the one carrying the Honorblade today.\nDead.\nThey came for the Blade, he realized.\nHuio—who was better at field medicine than Teft—took over\nministering to Rock. Blood on his hands, Teft stumbled back."

They should have a spanreed to contact the\nOathgate!”\nLaran dashed out of the room. Nearby, Bisig groaned. His eyes fluttered\nopen. His entire arm was grey, and his uniform had been sliced through.\n“Bisig!” Peet asked. “Storms, what happened!”\n“Thought … thought it was one of us,” Bisig muttered. “I didn’t really\nlook—until he attacked.” He leaned back, groaning, closing his eyes. “He\nhad on a bridgeman coat.”\n“Stormfather!” Leyten said. “Did you see the face?”\nBisig nodded. “Nobody I recognize. A short man, Alethi. Bridge Four\ncoat, lieutenant’s knots on the shoulder…”\nLopen, nearby, frowned, then glanced toward Teft.\nA Bridge Four officer’s coat, worn as a disguise.

The Cost\nFIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nDalinar came to himself, gasping, in the cabin of a stormwagon. Heart\npounding, he spun about, kicking aside empty bottles and lifting his fists.\nOutside, the riddens of a storm washed the walls with rain.\nWhat in the Almighty’s tenth name had that been? One moment, he’d\nbeen lying in his bunk. The next, he had been … Well, he didn’t rightly\nremember. What was the drink doing to him now?\nSomeone rapped on his door.\n“Yes?” Dalinar said, his voice hoarse.\n“The caravan is preparing to leave, Brightlord.”\n“Already? The rain hasn’t even stopped yet.”\n“I think they’re, um, eager to be rid of us, sir.”\nDalinar pushed open the door. Felt stood outside, a lithe man with long,\ndrooping mustaches and pale skin. Had to have some Shin blood in him,\njudging by those eyes.\nThough Dalinar hadn’t expressly said what he intended to do out here in\nHexi, his soldiers seemed to understand. Dalinar wasn’t sure whether he\nshould be proud of their loyalty, or scandalized by how easily they accepted\nhis intention to visit the Nightwatcher. Of course, one of them—Felt\nhimself—had been this way before.\nOutside, the caravan workers hitched up their chulls. They’d agreed to\ndrop him off here, along their path, but refused to take him farther toward\nthe Valley.\n“Can you get us the rest of the way?” Dalinar asked.\n“Sure,” Felt said. “We’re less than a day off.”\n“Then tell the good caravan master that we will take our wagons and"

Pay him what he asked, Felt, and then some on top.”\n“If you say so, Brightlord. Seems that having a Shardbearer along with\nhim should be payment enough.”\n“Explain that, in part, we’re buying his silence.”\nDalinar waited until the rain had mostly stopped, then threw on his coat\nand stepped out to join Felt, walking at the front of the wagons. He didn’t\nfeel like being cooped up any longer.\nHe’d expected this land to look like the Alethi plains. After all, the\nwindswept flatlands of Hexi were not unlike those of his homeland. Yet\nstrangely, there wasn’t a rockbud in sight. The ground was covered in\nwrinkles, like frozen ripples in a pond, perhaps two or three inches deep.\nThey were crusty on the stormward side, covered with lichen. On the\nleeward side, grass spread on the ground, flattened.\nThe sparse trees here were scrawny, hunched-over things with thistle\nleaves. Their branches bent so far leeward, they almost touched the ground.\nIt was like one of the Heralds had strolled through this place and bent\neverything sideways. The nearby mountainsides were bare, blasted and\nscoured raw.\n“Not far now, sir,” Felt said. The short man barely came up to the middle\nof Dalinar’s chest.\n“When you came before,” Dalinar said. “What … what did you see?”\n“To be frank, sir, nothing. She didn’t come to me. Doesn’t visit\neveryone, you see.” He clapped his hands, then breathed on them. It had\nbeen winter, lately. “You’ll want to go in right after dark. Alone, sir. She\navoids groups.”\n“Any idea why she didn’t visit you?”\n“Well, best I could figure, she doesn’t like foreigners.”\n“I might have trouble too.”\n“You’re a little less foreign, sir.”\nUp ahead, a group of small dark creatures burst from behind a tree and\nshot into the air, clumped together. Dalinar gaped at their speed and agility.\n“Chickens?” he said. Little black ones, each the size of a man’s fist.\nFelt chuckled. “Yes, wild chickens range this far east. Can’t see what\nthey’d be doing on this side of the mountains though.”\nThe chickens eventually picked another bent-over tree and settled in its\nbranches.\n“Sir,” Felt said. “Forgive me for asking, but you sure you want to do\nthis? You’ll be in her power, in there. And you don’t get to pick the cost.”\nDalinar said nothing, feet crunching on fans of weeds that trembled and\nrattled when he touched them. There was so much emptiness here in Hexi.\nIn Alethkar, you couldn’t go more than a day or two without running into a\nfarming village. They hiked for a good three hours, during which Dalinar\nfelt both an anxiety to be finished and—at the same time—a reluctance to\nprogress. He had enjoyed his recent sense of purpose.

If he was going to the Nightwatcher\nanyway, then why fight the drink?\nHe’d spent much of the trip intoxicated. Now, with the alcohol running\nout, the voices of the dead seemed to chase him. They were worst when he\ntried to sleep, and he felt a dull ache behind his eyes from poor rest.\n“Sir?” Felt eventually asked. “Look there.” He pointed to a thin strip of\ngreen painting the windswept mountainside.\nAs they continued, Dalinar got a better view. The mountains split into a\nvalley here, and since the opening pointed to the northeast, foothills\nshielded the interior from highstorms.\nSo plant life had exploded inside. Vines, ferns, flowers, and grasses grew\ntogether in a wall of underbrush. Trees stretched above them, and these\nweren’t the durable stumpweights of his homeland. These were gnarled,\ntall, and twisted, with branches that wound together. They were overgrown\nwith draping moss and vines, lifespren bobbing about them in plenitude.\nIt all piled atop itself, reeds and branches sticking out in all directions,\nferns so overgrown with vines that they drooped beneath the weight. It\nreminded Dalinar of a battlefield. A grand tapestry, depicting people locked\nin mortal combat, each one struggling for advantage.\n“How does one enter?” Dalinar asked. “How do you pass through that?”\n“There are some trails,” Felt said. “If you look hard enough. Shall we\ncamp here, sir? You can scout out a path tomorrow, and make your final\ndecision?”\nHe nodded, and they set up at the edge of the breach, close enough he\ncould smell the humidity inside. They set up the wagons as a barrier\nbetween two trees, and the men soon had tents assembled. They were quick\nto get a fire going. There was a … feeling to the place. Like you could hear\nall of those plants growing. The valley shivered and cracked. When wind\nblew out, it was hot and muggy.\nThe sun set behind the mountains, plunging them into darkness. Soon\nafter, Dalinar started inward. He couldn’t wait another day. The sound of it\nlured him. The vines rustling, moving as tiny animals scampered between\nthem. Leaves curling. The men didn’t call after him; they understood his\ndecision.\nHe stepped into the musty, damp valley, vines brushing his head. He\ncould barely see in the darkness, but Felt had been right—trails revealed\nthemselves as vines and branches bent away from him, allowing Dalinar\nentrance with the same reluctance as guards allowing an unfamiliar man\ninto the presence of their king.\nHe had hoped for the Thrill to aid him here. This was a challenge, was it\nnot? He felt nothing, not even a hint.\nHe trudged through the darkness, and suddenly felt stupid. What was he\ndoing here? Chasing a pagan superstition while the rest of the highprinces\ngathered to punish Gavilar’s killers?

He wanted to escape the drink? He just needed to\nsummon Oathbringer and find someone to fight.\nWho knew what was out there in this forest? If he were a bandit, this was\ncertainly where he would set up. People must flock here. Damnation! He\nwouldn’t be surprised to discover that someone had started all this simply to\ndraw in unsuspecting marks.\nWait. What was that? A sound different from scurries in the underbrush\nor vines withdrawing. He stopped in place, listening. It was …\nWeeping.\nOh, Almighty above. No.\nHe heard a boy weeping, pleading for his life. It sounded like Adolin.\nDalinar turned from the sound, searching the darkness. Other screams and\npleas joined that one, people burning as they died.\nIn a moment of panic, he turned to run back the way he’d come. He\nimmediately tripped in the underbrush.\nHe collapsed against rotten wood, vines twisting under his fingers.\nPeople screamed and howled all around, the sounds echoing in the near-\nabsolute darkness.\nFrantic, he summoned Oathbringer and stumbled to his feet, then began\nslashing, trying to clear space. Those voices. All around him!\nHe pushed past a tree trunk, fingers digging into the hanging moss and\nwet bark. Was the entrance this way?\nSuddenly he saw himself in the Unclaimed Hills, fighting those\ntraitorous parshmen. He saw himself killing, and hacking, and murdering.\nHe saw his lust, eyes wide and teeth clenched in a dreadful grin. A skull’s\ngrin.\nHe saw himself strangling Elhokar, who had never possessed his father’s\npoise or charm. Dalinar took the throne. It should have been his anyway.\nHis armies poured into Herdaz, then Jah Keved. He became a king of\nkings, a mighty conqueror whose accomplishments far overshadowed those\nof his brother. Dalinar forged a unified Vorin empire that covered half of\nRoshar. An unparalleled feat!\nAnd he saw them burn.\nHundreds of villages. Thousands upon thousands of people. It was the\nonly way. If a town resisted, you burned it to the ground. You slaughtered\nany who fought back, and you left the corpses of their loved ones to feed\nthe scavengers. You sent terror before you like a storm until your enemies\nsurrendered.\nThe Rift would be but the first in a long line of examples. He saw\nhimself standing upon the heaped corpses, laughing. Yes, he had escaped\nthe drink. He had become something grand and terrible.\nThis was his future.\nGasping, Dalinar dropped to his knees in the dark forest and allowed the\nvoices to swarm around him. He heard Evi among them, crying as she\nburned to death, unseen, unknown. Alone. He let Oathbringer slip from his\nfingers and shatter to mist.\nThe crying faded until it was distant.\nSon of Honor … a new sound whispered on the winds, a voice like the\nrustling of the trees.\nHe opened his eyes to find himself in a tiny clearing, bathed in starlight."

You smell of desperation. The feminine voice was like a\nhundred overlapping whispers. The elongated figure moved among the trees\nringing the clearing, stalking him like a predator.\n“They … they say you can change a man,” Dalinar said, weary.\nThe Nightwatcher seeped from the darkness. She was a dark green mist,\nvaguely shaped like a crawling person. Too-long arms reached out, pulling\nher along as she floated above the ground. Her essence, like a tail, extended\nfar behind her, weaving among tree trunks and disappearing into the forest.\nIndistinct and vaporous, she flowed like a river or an eel, and the only\npart of her with any specific detail was her smooth, feminine face. She\nglided toward him until her nose was mere inches from his own, her silken\nblack eyes meeting his. Tiny hands sprouted from the misty sides of her\nhead. They reached out, taking his face and touching it with a thousand cold\n—yet gentle—caresses.\nWhat is it you wish of me? the Nightwatcher asked. What boon drives\nyou, Son of Honor? Son of Odium?\nShe started to circle him. The tiny black hands kept touching his face,\nbut their arms stretched out, becoming tentacles.\nWhat would you like? she asked. Renown? Wealth? Skill? Would you like\nto be able to swing a sword and never tire?\n“No,” Dalinar whispered.\nBeauty? Followers? I can feed your dreams, make you glorious.\nHer dark mists wrapped around him. The tiny tendrils tickled his skin.\nShe brought her face right up to his again. What is your boon?\nDalinar blinked tears, listening to the sounds of the children dying in the\ndistance, and whispered a single word.\n“Forgiveness.”\nThe Nightwatcher’s tendrils dodged away from his face, like splayed\nfingers. She leaned back, pursing her lips.\nPerhaps it is possessions you wish, she said. Spheres, gemstones. Shards.\nA Blade that bleeds darkness and cannot be defeated. I can give it to you.\n“Please,” Dalinar said, drawing in a ragged breath. “Tell me. Can I …\ncan I ever be forgiven?”\nIt wasn’t what he’d intended to request.\nHe couldn’t remember what he’d intended to request.\nThe Nightwatcher curled around him, agitated. Forgiveness is no boon.\nWhat should I do to you. What should I give you? Speak it, human. I—\nTHAT IS ENOUGH, CHILD.\nThis new voice startled them both. If the Nightwatcher’s voice was like\nwhispering wind, this one was like tumbling stones. The Nightwatcher\nbacked away from him in a sharp motion.\nHesitant, Dalinar turned and found a woman with brown skin—the color\nof darkwood bark—standing at the edge of the clearing.

Had he felt so bad for failing her by letting assassins\nclaim her life? He searched his mind, and found that he couldn’t recall what\nshe looked like. No image of her face, no memories of their time together.\nNothing.\nHe did remember these last few years as a drunkard. The years before,\nspent in conquest. In fact, everything about his past seemed clear except her.\n“Well?” Felt said, kneeling beside him. “I assume it … happened.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said.\n“Anything we need to know about?” he asked. “I once heard of a man\nwho visited here, and from then on, every person he touched fell upward\ninstead of down.”\n“You needn’t worry.

Almighty, what a foolish quest this had been.

By the time I arrive, I want\nto have battle maps and plans for the Parshendi conquest.”\nHe’d moped long enough. He had not always been the best of brothers,\nor the best of lighteyes.

The wind was sharply chill. Crisp. It\ndidn’t linger, but passed him by, turning the pages of his book with a quiet\nruffling sound.\nIt fled from the Everstorm.\nCrimson. Furious. Burning. The Everstorm’s clouds flowed in from the\nwest. Like blood billowing in water, each new thunderhead spurted from the\none behind it, hemorrhaging fits of lightning. And beneath the storm—\nwithin its shadow, and upon those tempestuous seas—ships dotted the\nwaves.\n“Ships?” he whispered. “They sailed during the storm?”\nHe controls it, the Stormfather said, his voice diminutive—like the"

He uses it, as Honor once used me.\nSo much for stopping the enemy in the ocean. Dalinar’s fledgling armada\nhad fled to take shelter from the storm, and the enemy had sailed in\nuncontested. The coalition had shattered anyway; they wouldn’t defend this\ncity.\nThe storm slowed as it darkened the bay in front of Thaylen City—then\nseemed to stop. It dominated the sky to the west, but strangely did not\nproceed. Enemy ships landed in its shadow, many ramming right up onto\nthe shores.\nAmaram’s troops flooded out of the gates to seize the ground between\nbay and city; there wasn’t enough room for them to maneuver on top of the\nwall. The Alethi were field troops, and their best chance of victory would\ninvolve hitting the parshmen while they disembarked. Behind them,\nThaylen troops mounted the wall, but they were not veterans. Their navy\nhad always been their strength.\nDalinar could faintly hear General Khal on the street below, shouting for\nrunners and scribes to send word to Urithiru, calling up the Alethi\nreinforcements. Too slow, Dalinar thought. Suitably deploying troops could\ntake hours, and though Amaram was hustling his men, they weren’t going to\nget together in time for a proper assault on the ships.\nAnd then there were the Fused, dozens of which launched into the skies\nfrom the ships. He imagined his armies bottlenecked as they left the\nOathgate, assaulted from the air as they tried to fight through the streets to\nreach the lower portion of the city.\nIt came together with a frightening beauty. Their armada fleeing the\nstorm. Their armies unprepared. The sudden evaporation of support …\n“He’s planned for everything.”\nIt is what he does.\n“You know, Cultivation warned me that my memories would return. She\nsaid she was ‘pruning’ me. Do you know why she did that? Did I have to\nremember?”\nI do not know. Is it relevant?\n“That depends upon the answer to a question,” Dalinar said. He carefully\nclosed the book atop the dresser before the window, then felt the symbols\non its cover. “What is the most important step that a man can take?”\nHe straightened his blue uniform, then slipped the tome off the table.\nWith The Way of Kings a comfortable weight in his hand, he stepped out the\ndoor and into the city.\n* * *\n“All this way,” Shallan whispered, “and they’re already here?”\nKaladin and Adolin stood like two statues to either side of her, their faces\ntwin stoic masks. She could see the Oathgate distinctly; that round platform\nat the edge of the bridge was the exact size of the control buildings.\nHundreds upon hundreds of strange spren stood in the lake of beads that\nmarked the shore of Thaylen City. They looked vaguely humanoid, though\nthey were twisted and odd, like shimmering dark light.

It was something more terrible than all of these—\nsomething that made her eyes hurt to look upon. And as if that weren’t\nenough, a half dozen Fused passed overhead, then landed on the bridge that\nled to the Oathgate platform.\n“They knew,” Adolin said. “They led us here with that cursed vision.”\n“Be wary,” Shallan whispered, “of anyone who claims to be able to see\nthe future.”\n“No. No, that wasn’t from him!” Kaladin looked between them, frantic,\nand finally turned to Syl for support. “It was like when the Stormfather … I\nmean…”\n“Azure warned us from this path,” Adolin said.\n“And what else could we have done?” Kaladin said, then hushed his\nvoice, pulling back with the rest of them into the shadowed concealment of\nthe trees. “We couldn’t go to the Horneater Peaks, like Azure wanted. The\nenemy waits there too! Everyone says their ships patrol there.” Kaladin\nshook his head. “This was our only option.”\n“We don’t have enough food to return…” Adolin said.\n“Even if we did,” Syl whispered, “where would we go? They hold\nCelebrant. They’re watching this Oathgate, so they’re probably watching\nthe others.…”\nShallan sank down on the obsidian ground. Pattern put his hand on her\nshoulder, humming softly with concern. Her body yearned for Stormlight to\nwash away her fatigue. Light could make an illusion, change this world into\nsomething else—at least for a few moments—so she could pretend …\n“Kaladin is right,” Syl said. “We can’t back down now. Our remaining\ngemstones won’t last much longer.”\n“We have to try,” Kaladin said with a nod.\n“Try what, Kal?” Adolin said. “Take on an army of Voidbringers by\nourselves?”\n“I don’t know how the portal works,” Shallan added. “I don’t even know\nhow much Stormlight it might require.”\n“We’ll … we’ll try something,” Kaladin said. “We have Stormlight still.\nAn illusion? A distraction? We could get you to the Oathgate, and you\ncould … find out how to free us.” He shook his head. “We can make it\nwork. We have to.”\nShallan bowed her head, listening to Pattern hum.

Second, she needed to help evacuate Thaylen City; she had\nalready warned Urithiru to prepare for refugees.\nBoth these goals would wait a short time as she dealt with a matter even\nmore pressing.\n“The facts align,” Ivory said. “The truth that has always been, will now\nsoon manifest to all.” He rode upon the high collar of her dress, tiny,\nholding on with one hand. “You are correct. A traitor is.”\nJasnah undid the buttons on her safehand sleeve and pinned it back,\nexposing the gloved hand underneath. In preparation, she’d also worn a\nscout’s yellow and gold havah, with shorter skirts slit at the sides and front,\ntrousers underneath.

The city before\nher was yet another marvel. Built up the side of a mountain, it looked\nalmost like it had been cut from the stone—sculpted like the winds and rain\nhad shaped the Shattered Plains.\nHundreds of singers streamed around her. Hulking Fused walked among\nthem, bearing carapace armor as impressive as any Shardplate. Some of the\nordinary singers wore warform—but unlike their Alethi counterparts, they\nhad not been through combat training.\nAzish, Thaylen, Marati … a host of nationalities, these newly awakened\nsingers were frightened, uncertain. Venli attuned Agony. Would they force\nher to march to the front line? She didn’t have much battle training either;\neven with a form of power, she’d be cut to ribbons.\nLike my people, on the field of Narak, who were sacrificed to birth the\nEverstorm. Odium seemed very quick to expend the lives of both listener\nand singer.\nTimbre pulsed to Peace in her pouch, and Venli rested her hand on it.\n“Hush,” she whispered to Agony. “Hush. Do you want one of them to hear\nyou?”\nTimbre reluctantly softened her pulsings, though Venli could still feel a\nfaint vibration from her pouch. And that … that relaxed her. She almost\nthought that she could hear the Rhythm of Peace herself.\nOne of the hulking Fused called for her. “You! Listener woman! Come!”"

She took it, then attuned\nSubservience. “I’ve used an axe before, but not—”\n“Carry it,” he said, eyes glowing softly red. “You may need to defend\nyourself.”\nShe did not object further. There was a fine line between respectful\nconfidence and defiance. She belted the sword on her slender body, wishing\nshe had some carapace.\n“Now,” the Fused said to Conceit, striding forward and expecting her to\nkeep up, “tell me what this little one is saying.”\nVenli followed him to a gathering of singers in workform, holding\nspears. She had been speaking to the Fused in the ancient language, but\nthese were speaking in Thaylen.\nI’m an interpreter, she thought, relaxing. That’s why they wanted me on\nthe battlefield.\n“What was it,” Venli said to Derision, addressing the one the Fused had\nindicated, “you wished to say to the holy one?”\n“We…” The singer licked his lips. “We aren’t soldiers, ma’am. We’re\nfishers. What are we doing here?” Though a shade of the Rhythm of\nAnxiety laced his words, his cringing form and face were the stronger\nindication. He spoke and acted like a human.\nShe interpreted.\n“You are here to do as you are told,” the Fused told them, through Venli.\n“In return, you are rewarded with further opportunities to serve.” Though\nhis rhythm was Derision, he didn’t seem angry. More … as if he were\nlecturing a child.\nShe passed that along, and the sailors looked to each other, shuffling\nuncomfortably.\n“They wish to object,” she told the Fused. “I can read it in them.”\n“They may speak,” he said.\nShe prompted them, and their leader looked down, then spoke to\nAnxiety. “It’s just that … Thaylen City? This is our home. We’re expected\nto attack it?”\n“Yes,” the Fused said after Venli interpreted. “They enslaved you. They\ntore your families apart, treated you like dumb animals. Do you not thirst\nfor vengeance?”\n“Vengeance?” the sailor said, looking to his fellows for support. “We’re\nglad to be free. But … I mean … some of them treated us pretty nice. Can’t\nwe just go settle somewhere, and leave the Thaylens alone?”\n“No,” the Fused said. Venli interpreted, then jumped to follow him as he\nstalked off.\n“Great one?” she asked to Subservience.\n“These have the wrong Passion,” he said. “The ones who attacked\nKholinar did so gladly.”\n“The Alethi are a warlike people, great one.

You must earn your Passion.\nQualify yourselves for greater service, and you will be elevated to the\nplace of a Regal, given a form of power.\nThis land was yours long ago, before they stole it. You have been trained\nto be docile. We will teach you to be strong again.\nThe Fused remained calm, but fierce. Like a smoldering fire. Controlled,\nbut ready to burst alight. He eventually walked to join some of his fellows.\nAround them, the singer army formed up awkwardly, coating the land just\neast of the bay. Alethi troops mustered across a short battlefield, banners\nflapping. They had archers, heavy infantry, light infantry, even some\noutriders on horses.\nVenli hummed to Agony. This was going to be a slaughter.\nShe suddenly felt something odd. Like a rhythm, but oppressive,\ndemanding. It shook the very air, and the ground beneath her feet trembled.\nLightning in the clouds behind seemed to flash to this rhythm, and in a\nmoment she saw that the area around her was filled with ghostly spren.\nThose are the spirits of the dead, she realized. Fused who haven’t yet\nchosen a body. Most were twisted to the point that she barely recognized\nthem as singers. Two were roughly the size of buildings.\nOne dominated even these: a creature of swirling violence, tall as a small\nhill, seemingly made up entirely of red smoke. She could see these overlaid\non the real world, but somehow knew they would be invisible to most. She\ncould see into the other world. That happened sometimes right before …\nA blistering heat shone behind her.\nVenli braced herself. She usually only saw him during the storms. But …\nthis was a storm. It hovered behind, immobile, churning the seas.\nLight crystallized beside her, forming an ancient parshman with a face\nmarbled gold and white, and a regal scepter he carried like a cane. For once,\nhis presence didn’t vaporize her immediately.\nVenli released a relieved breath. This was more an impression than his\ntrue being.

He groaned, then lay there,\nknocking his head against the stone.\nWould that he could find someplace hidden, and squeeze inside, never\never to be found again.\nWhen he looked up, she was standing there. The woman made of light\nand air, with curls of hair that vanished into mist.\n“Why are you following me?” Teft growled. “Go pick one of the others.\nKelek!

Light from ahead showed that he’d\naccidentally made his way to the outer ring of the tower, where windows\nand balconies overlooked the Oathgate platforms.\nHe stopped by a stone doorway, puffing, holding on with a hand that bled\nfrom the knuckles.\n“Teft.”\n“You don’t want me. I’m broken. Pick Lopen. Rock. Sigzil. Damnation,\nwoman. I…”\nWhat was that?\nDrawn by faint sounds, Teft walked into the empty room. Those\nsounds … Shouts?\nHe walked out onto the balcony.

Finally.\nShe checked her arm clock. If only she could find a fabrial that would\nmanipulate exhaustion, not just pain. Wouldn’t that be something.

Below, Amaram’s troops\nflew the new Sadeas banner: the axe and the tower, white on forest green.\nAnticipationspren and fearspren—the eternal attendants of the battlefield—\ngrew up around them. Sadeas’s men were still streaming through the gates,\nbut already blocks of archers moved forward. They’d soon start pelting the\ndisorganized parshman army.\nThat storm though …\n“The enemy only keeps coming,” Fen said as Navani approached, her\nadmirals making room. “I’ll soon get to judge your famed Alethi troops\nfirsthand—as they fight an impossible battle.”\n“Actually,” Navani said, “we’re better off than it looks. The new Sadeas\nis a renowned tactician. His soldiers are well rested and—if lacking in\ndiscipline—known for their tenacity. We can attack the enemy before it\nfinishes deploying. Then, if they rebound and overwhelm us with numbers,\nwe can pull back into the city until we get reinforcements.”\nKmakl, Fen’s consort, nodded. “This is winnable, Fen.

She cried out, grabbing the battlement to keep from falling.\nOut in the field, between the enemy troops and the Alethi ones, the\nground shattered. Lines and cracks split the stone, and then an enormous\nstone arm pulled itself from the ground—the fractures having outlined its\nhand, forearm, elbow, and upper arm.\nA monster easily thirty feet tall pulled itself from the stone, dropping\nchips and dust on the army below.

One crawled into the\nstone ground, somehow inhabiting it like a spren taking residence in a\ngemheart. The stone became its form.\nThen it ripped itself free of the rock. Around her, the parshmen stumbled\nback in awe, so surprised that they actually drew spren. The thing loomed\nover the human forces, while its companion climbed into the stone ground,\nbut didn’t rip out immediately.\nThere was one other, mightier than even these. It was out in the water of\nthe bay, but when she looked into the other world, she couldn’t help but\nglance toward it. If those two lesser souls had created such daunting stone\nmonsters, then what was that mountain of power?\nIn the Physical Realm, the Fused knelt and bowed their heads toward\nOdium. So they could see him too. Venli knelt quickly, knocking her knees\nagainst the stone. Timbre pulsed to Anxiety, and Venli put her hand on the\npouch, squeezing it. Quiet. We can’t fight him.\n“Turash,” Odium said, resting fingers upon the shoulder of the Fused she\nhad been following. “Old friend, you look well in this new body.”\n“Thank you, master,” Turash said.\n“Your mind holds firm, Turash. I am proud of you.” Odium waved\ntoward Thaylen City. “I have prepared a grand army for our victory today.\nWhat do you think of our prize?”\n“An excellent position of great import, even without the Oathgate,”\nTurash said. “But I fear for our armies, master.”\n“Oh?” Odium asked.\n“They are weak, untrained, and frightened. Many may refuse to fight.\nThey don’t crave vengeance, master. Even with the thunderclast, we may be\noutmatched.”\n“These?” Odium asked, looking over his shoulder at the gathered\nsingers. “Oh, Turash. You think too small, my friend! These are not my\narmy. I brought them here to watch.”\n“Watch what?” Venli asked, looking up. She cringed, but Odium paid her\nno mind. Odium held his hands to the sides, yellow-gold power streaming\nbehind his figure like a wind made visible. Beyond him, in the other place,\nthat red churning power became more real.

Last Dalinar had seen, the highprince had\nbeen arranging his archers—but from this low in the city, Dalinar couldn’t\nsee the troops outside.\nA sudden feeling slammed into him.\nIt was focus and passion. An eager energy, a warmth, a promise of\nstrength.\nGlory.\nLife.\nTo Dalinar, this thirst for the battle felt like the attentions of a lover\nyou’d turned away long ago. The Thrill was here. His old, dear friend.\n“No,” he whispered, sagging against a wall. The emotion struck him\nharder than the earthquake had. “No.”\nThe taste was so, so appealing. It whispered that he could save this city\nall on his own. Let the Thrill in, and the Blackthorn could return. He didn’t\nneed Shards. He only needed this passion. Sweeter than any wine.\nNo.\nHe shoved the Thrill aside, scrambling to his feet. As he did, however, a\nshadow moved beyond the wall. A monster of stone, one of the beasts from\nhis visions, standing some thirty feet tall—looming over the twenty-foot\ncity wall. The thunderclast clasped its hands together, then swung them low,\ncrashing them through the city wall, flinging out chunks of stone.\nDalinar leaped toward cover, but a falling boulder pounded into him,\ncrushing him into a wall.\nBlackness.\nFalling.\nPower.\nHe gasped, and Stormlight flooded into him—he shook awake to find his\narm pinned by the boulder, rocks and dust falling on a rubble-strewn street\nbefore him. And … not just rubble. He coughed, realizing some of those\nlumps were bodies coated in dust, lying motionless.\nHe struggled to pull his arm from under the boulder. Nearby, the\nthunderclast kicked at the broken wall, opening a hole. Then it stepped\nthrough, footfalls shaking the ground, approaching the shelf that made up\nthe front of the Ancient Ward.\nA massive stone foot thumped to the ground by Dalinar. Storms! Dalinar\nhauled on his arm, heedless of the pain or the damage to his body, and\nfinally got it free. The Stormlight healed him as he crawled away, ducking\nas the monster ripped the roof off a building at the front of the Ancient\nWard and sent debris raining down.\nThe Gemstone Reserve?

The monster cast the roof aside, and several\nFused that he’d missed before—they were riding on its shoulders—slipped\ndown into the building. Dalinar was torn between heading for the battlefield\noutside, and investigating whatever was going on here.\nAny idea what they’re after? he asked the Stormfather.\nNo. This is odd behavior.\nIn a flash decision, Dalinar yanked his book out from under some rubble\nnearby, then went running back up the now-empty steps to the Ancient\nWard, dangerously close to the thunderclast.\nThe monster released a sudden piercing roar, like a thunderclap. The\nshock wave almost knocked Dalinar off his feet again. In a fit of rage, the\ntitanic creature attacked the Gemstone Reserve, ripping apart its walls and\ninnards, tossing chunks backward. A million sparkling bits of glass caught\nthe sunlight as they fell over the city, the wall, and beyond.\nSpheres and gemstones, Dalinar realized. All the wealth of Thaylenah.\nScattered like leaves.\nThe thing seemed increasingly angry as it pounded the area around the\nreserve. Dalinar put his back to a wall as two Fused darted past, led by what\nappeared to be a glowing yellow spren. These two Fused didn’t seem to be\nable to fly, but there was a startling grace to their motion. They slid along\nthe stone street with no apparent effort, as if the ground were greased.\nDalinar gave chase, squeezing past a group of scribes huddled in the\nstreet, but before he could catch up, the Fused attacked one palanquin\namong the many trying to move through the crowds. They knocked it over,\nshoving aside the porters, and dug inside.\nThe Fused ignored Dalinar’s shouts. They soon streaked away—one\ntucking a large object under its arm. Dalinar drew in Stormlight from some\nfleeing merchants, then ran the rest of the distance to the palanquin. Amid\nthe wreckage he found a young Thaylen woman alongside an elderly man\nwho appeared to have been previously wounded, judging by the bandages.\nDalinar helped the dazed young woman to a sitting position. “What did\nthey want?”\n“Brightlord?” she said in Thaylen. She blinked, then seized his arm.\n“The King’s Drop … a ruby. They tried to steal it before, and now, now\nthey’ve taken it!”\nA ruby? A simple gemstone? The porters attended to the old man, who\nwas barely conscious.\nDalinar looked over his shoulder at the retreating thunderclast. The\nenemy had ignored the wealth of the Gemstone Reserve. Why would they\nwant a specific ruby? He was about to press for more details when\nsomething else drew his attention. From this higher vantage, he could see\nthrough the hole the thunderclast had broken in the wall.\nFigures outside with glowing red eyes arrayed themselves on the\nbattlefield—but they weren’t parshmen.\nThose were Sadeas uniforms.\n* * *\nJasnah moved into the temple, gripping her Shardblade, stepping on\nslippered feet.

The red spren rising from Renarin—like a snowflake made of\ncrystal and light—seemed to sense her and panicked, disappearing into\nRenarin with a puff.\nA spren is, Ivory said. The wrong spren is.\nRenarin Kholin was a liar. He was no Truthwatcher.\nThat is a spren of Odium, Ivory said. Corrupted spren. But … a human,\nbonded to one? This thing is not.\n“It is,” Jasnah whispered. “Somehow.”\nShe was now close enough to hear Renarin whispering. “No … Not\nFather. No, please…”\n* * *\nShallan wove Light.\nA simple illusion, recalled from the pages of her sketchpad: some\nsoldiers from the army, people from Urithiru, and some of the spren she’d\nsketched on her trip. Around twenty individuals in total.\n“Taln’s nails,” Adolin said as Kaladin shot upward through the sky. “The\nbridgeboy is really into it.”\nKaladin drew away four of the Fused, but two remained behind. Shallan\nadded an illusion of Azure to her group, then some of the Reachers she’d\ndrawn. She hated using up so much Stormlight—what if she didn’t have\nenough left to get through the Oathgate?\n“Good luck,” she whispered to Adolin. “Remember, I won’t be\ncontrolling these directly. They will make only rudimentary motions.”\n“We’ll be fine.” Adolin glanced at Pattern, Syl, and the spren of his\nsword. “Right, guys?”\n“Mmmm,” Pattern said. “I do not like being stabbed.”\n“Wise words, friend. Wise words.” Adolin gave Shallan a kiss, then they\ntook off running toward the bridge. Syl, Pattern, and the deadeye followed\n—as did the illusions, which were bound to Adolin.\nThis force drew the attention of the last two Fused. As those were\ndistracted, Shallan slipped over to the base of the bridge, then eased herself\ndown into the beads. She crossed silently beneath the bridge, using precious\nStormlight to make herself a safe walking platform with one of the beads\nshe’d found while on Honor’s Path.\nShe made her way across to the small island platform that represented\nthe Oathgate on this side. Two enormous spren stood above it.\nJudging by the shouting on the bridge, Adolin and the others were doing\ntheir job. But could Shallan do hers? She stepped up beneath the two\nsentinels, which stood tall as buildings, reminiscent of statues in armor.\nOne mother-of-pearl, the other black with a variegated oily shimmer. Did\nthey guard the Oathgate, or did they—somehow—facilitate its workings?\nAt a loss for what else to do, Shallan simply waved her hand. “Um,\nhello?”\nSteadily, two heads turned down toward her.\n* * *\nThe air around Venli—once crowded by the spirits of the dead—was now\nempty save for the single black figure of swirling smoke.

She’d missed that\none at first, as it was the size of a normal person. It stood near Odium, and\nshe did not know what it represented.\nThe second thunderclast dragged arms as long as its body, with hands\nlike hooks. It crossed the field eastward, toward the city walls and the\nhuman army of turncoats. Just behind Venli, to the west, the common\nsingers stood arrayed before their ships. They stayed far from the red mist\nof the Unmade coating the north side of the battlefield.\nOdium stood beside Venli, a glowing force of burning gold. The first\nthunderclast left the city and placed something down on the ground: two of\nthe Fused—gods with lithe bodies and little armor. They skirted the turncoat\narmy, sliding along the rock with an uncanny grace.\n“What is that they carry?” Venli asked. “A gemstone? Is that why we\ncame here? A rock?”\n“No,” Odium said. “That is merely a precaution, a last-minute addition I\nmade to prevent a potential disaster. The prize I claim today is far greater—\neven more grand than the city itself. The conduit of my freedom. The bane\nof Roshar. Forward, child. To the gap in the wall. I may need you to speak\nfor me.”\nShe swallowed, then started hiking toward the city. The dark spirit\nfollowed, the one of swirling mists, the last who had yet to inhabit a body.\n* * *\nKaladin soared through this place of black heavens, haunted clouds, and a\ndistant sun. Only four of the Fused had chosen to take off after him. Adolin\nwould have to deal with the other two.\nThe four flew with precision. They used Lashings like Kaladin did,\nthough they didn’t seem to be able to vary their speed as much as he could.\nIt took them longer to build up to greater Lashings, which should have\nmade it easy to stay ahead of them.\nBut storms, the way they flew! So graceful. They didn’t jerk this way or\nthat, but flowed lithely from one motion to the next. They used their entire\nbodies to sculpt the wind of their passing and control their flight. Even the\nAssassin in White hadn’t been so fluid as these, so like the winds\nthemselves.\nKaladin had claimed the skies, but storms, it looked like he’d moved into\nterritory where someone had a prior entitlement.\nI don’t have to fight them, he thought. I only have to keep them busy long\nenough for Shallan to figure out how to activate the portal.\nKaladin Lashed himself upward, toward those strange, too-flat clouds.\nHe twisted in the air, and found one of the Fused almost upon him—a male\nwith pale white skin swirled through with a single marbling of red, like\nsmoke blown across the cheeks. The creature stabbed its long spear at him,\nbut Kaladin Lashed himself to the side just in time.\nLashing wasn’t flying, and that was part of its strength.

He fell up and\nslightly to the north, but fought while facing downward, battering away the\nenemy lance with his harpoon. The Fused’s weapon was far longer, with\nsharpened sides rather than a single fine point. Kaladin’s harpoon was at a\nsevere disadvantage.\nRight. Time to change that.\nAs the Fused rammed the lance upward again, Kaladin reached out with\nboth hands on his harpoon’s haft, holding it sideways. He let the enemy\nspear pass into the opening between his arms, chest, and harpoon.\nHe Lashed his own weapon downward with multiple Lashings. Then he\ndropped it.\nIt slid along the length of the lance and smacked into the Fused’s arms.\nThe creature shouted in pain, letting go of his weapon. At the same moment\nKaladin dove, canceling all upward Lashings and binding himself\ndownward instead.\nThe sudden, jarring change made his stomach lurch and his vision go\nblack. Even with Stormlight, this was almost too much. His ears ringing, he\ngritted his teeth, riding the momentary loss of sight until—blessedly—his\nvision returned. He spun in the air, then pulled up and snatched the falling\nlance as it dropped past him.\nThe four Fused swooped after him, more cautious. The wind of his\npassing chilled the sweat on his face from his near blackout.\nLet’s … not try that again, Kaladin thought, hefting his new weapon.\nHe’d practiced with things like this in pike walls, but they were normally\ntoo long to maneuver in one-on-one combat. Flying would negate that.\nThe Fused he’d disarmed swooped down to fetch the harpoon. Kaladin\nwaved his hand toward the others palm upward, then took off toward some\nnearby dark obsidian mountains, forested on the sides—the direction he and\nthe others had come. Down below, he could see Shallan’s illusions engaging\nthe two Fused on the bridge.\nEyes forward, Kaladin thought as the four others chased after him. He\nbelonged in the skies with these creatures.\nTime to prove it.\n* * *\nPrime Aqasix Yanagawn the First, emperor of all Makabak, paced in the\ncabin of his ship.\nHe was actually starting to feel like an emperor. He wasn’t embarrassed\ntalking to the viziers and scions any longer. He understood much of what\nthey discussed now, and didn’t jump when someone called him “Your\nMajesty.” Remarkably, he was starting to forget that he’d ever been a\nfrightened thief sneaking through the palace.\nBut then, even an emperor had limits to his rule.\nHe paced back the other way. Regal robes—of Azish patterns—weighed\nhim down, along with the Imperial Yuanazixin: a fancy hat with sweeping\nsides. He’d have taken the thing off, but he felt he needed its authority when\ntalking to his three most important advisors.\n“Lift thinks we should have stayed,” he said. “War is coming to Thaylen\nCity.”\n“We’re merely protecting our fleet from the storm,” Noura said."

We left\nbecause you’re worried that Kholin is being manipulated by the enemy.”\n“That is not the only reason,” Scion Unoqua said. He was an old man\nwith a full paunch. “We have always been skeptical of the Lost Radiants.\nThe powers that Dalinar Kholin wishes to harness are extremely dangerous,\nas now proven by the translations of an ancient record!”\n“Lift says—” Yanagawn said.\n“Lift?” Noura said. “You listen to her far too much, Your Imperial\nMajesty.”\n“She’s smart.”\n“She once tried to eat your cummerbund.”\n“She … thought it sounded like a type of dessert.” Yanagawn took a\ndeep breath. “Besides, she’s not that kind of smart. She’s the other kind.”\n“What other kind, Your Imperial Majesty?” Vizier Dalksi asked. Her hair\nwas powder white, peeking out beneath her formal headdress.\n“The kind that knows when it’s wrong to betray a friend. I think we\nshould go back. Am I emperor or not?”\n“You are emperor,” Noura said. “But, Your Majesty, remember your\nlessons. The thing that separates us from the monarchies of the east—and\nthe chaos they suffer—is that our emperor is held in check. Azir can, and\nwill, withstand a change in dynasty. Your power is absolute, but you do not\nexercise it all. You must not.”\n“You were chosen,” Unoqua said, “by Yaezir himself to lead—”\n“I was chosen,” Yanagawn cut in, “because nobody would shed a tear if\nthe Assassin in White came for me! Let’s not play games, all right?”\n“You performed a miracle,” Unoqua said.\n“Lift performed a miracle. Using powers you now say are too dangerous\nto trust!”\nThe three—two viziers, one scion—looked to each other. Unoqua was\ntheir religious leader, but Noura had most seniority by year of passing the\ntests for master office, which she’d done—remarkably—at age twelve.\nYanagawn stopped by the cabin window. Outside, waves chopped,\nchurning, rocking their ship. His smaller ship had met up with the main\nfleet, then joined them in taking shelter in Vtlar Cove, along the Thaylen\ncoast. But reports via spanreed said that the Everstorm had stopped near\nThaylen City.\nA knock came at the door. Yanagawn let Dalksi—least senior, despite her\nage—call admittance. Yanagawn settled in his regal chair as a guardsman\nwith light brown skin entered. Yanagawn thought he recognized the man,\nwho held a cloth to the side of his face and winced as he gave the formal\nbow of admittance to the emperor.\n“Vono?” Noura asked. “What happened to your charge?

She’s not real big, that one.…”\nLift? Yanagawn thought. He almost cried out, demanding answers, but\nthat would have shamed this man. Yanagawn held himself back with\ndifficulty, and Noura nodded to him in appreciation of a lesson learned.\n“When was this?” Noura asked.\n“Right before we left,” the guard said. “Sorry, Your Grace. I’ve been\ndown since then, only now recovered.”\nYanagawn turned toward Noura. Surely now she would see the\nimportance of returning. The storm had yet to advance. They could go back\nif …\nAnother figure approached the door, a woman in the robes and pattern of\na second-level scribe, seventh circle. She entered and quickly gave the\nformal bows to Yanagawn, so hasty she forgot the third gesture of\nsubservient obedience.\n“Viziers,” she said, bowing in turn to them, then to Unoqua. “News from\nthe city!”\n“Good news?” Noura asked hopefully.\n“The Alethi have turned against the Thaylens, and now seek to conquer\nthem! They’ve been allied with the parshmen all along. Your Grace, by\nfleeing, we have narrowly avoided a trap!”\n“Quickly,” Noura said. “Separate our ships from any that bear Alethi\ntroops. We must not be caught unaware!”\nThey left, abandoning Yanagawn to the care of a dozen young scribes\nwho were next in line for basking in his presence. He settled into his seat,\nworried and afraid, feeling a sickness in his gut. The Alethi, traitors?\nLift had been wrong. He had been wrong.\nYaezir bless them. This really was the end of days.\n* * *\nWe are the gatekeepers, the two enormous spren said to Shallan, speaking\nwith voices that overlapped, as if one. Though their mouths did not move,\nthe voices reverberated through Shallan. Lightweaver, you have no\npermission to use this portal.\n“But I need to get through,” Shallan cried up to them. “I have Stormlight\nto pay!”\nYour payment will be refused. We are locked by the word of the parent.\n“Your parent? Who?”\nThe parent is dead now.\n“So…”\nWe are locked. Travel to and from Shadesmar was prohibited during the\nparent’s last days. We are bound to obey.\nBehind Shallan, on the bridge, Adolin had devised a clever tactic. He\nacted like an illusion.\nHer false people had instructions to act like they were fighting—though\nwithout her direct attention, that meant they just stood around and slashed at\nthe air. To avoid revealing himself, Adolin had chosen to do the same,\nslashing about with his harpoon randomly. Pattern and Syl did likewise,\nwhile the two Fused hovered overhead.

She looked back up at the gatekeepers. “Please.\nThe other Oathgate—the one at Kholinar—let me through.”\nImpossible, they said. We are bound by Honor, by rules spren cannot\nbreak. This portal is closed.\n“Then why did you let those others through? The army that stood around\nhere earlier?”\nThe souls of the dead? They did not need our portal.

But we\ncannot do that which was forbidden.\n* * *\nSzeth of the Skybreakers hovered far above the battlefield.\n“The Alethi have changed sides, aboshi?” Szeth asked.\n“They have seen the truth,” Nin said, hovering beside him. Only the two\nof them watched; Szeth did not know where the rest of the Skybreakers had\ngone.\nNearby, the Everstorm rumbled its discontent. Red lightning rippled\nacross the surface, passing from one cloud to the next.\n“All along,” Szeth said, “this world belonged to the parshmen. My\npeople watched not for the return of an invading enemy, but for the masters\nof the house.”\n“Yes,” Nin said.\n“And you sought to stop them.”\n“I knew what must happen if they returned.” Nin turned toward him.\n“Who has jurisdiction over this land, Szeth-son-Neturo? A man can rule his\nhome until the citylord demands his taxes. The citylord controls his lands\nuntil the highlord, in turn, comes to him for payment. But the highlord must\nanswer to the highprince, when war is called in his lands. And the king?\nHe … must answer to God.”\n“You said God was dead.”\n“A god is dead. Another won the war by right of conquest. The original\nmasters of this land have returned, as you so aptly made metaphor, with the\nkeys to the house. So tell me, Szeth-son-Neturo—he who is about to swear\nthe Third Ideal—whose law should the Skybreakers follow?

Let’s go fight those guys.\n“The parshmen? They are the rightful rulers of the land,” Szeth said.\nRightful? Who has a right to land? Humans are always claiming things.\nBut nobody asks the things, now do they? Well, nobody owns me. Vivenna\ntold me. I’m my own sword.\n“I have no choice.”\nReally?

He used his arms to\nsculpt the wind around himself, angling toward a crack through the glossy\nblack rock where two mountains met.\nAlive with Light and wind, he didn’t care if the Fused were gaining on\nhim or not.\nLet them watch.\nHis angle was wrong to get through the crack, so Kaladin Lashed\nhimself back away from the mountain slope in an enormous loop,\ncontinuously changing his Lashings one after another. He made a circle in\nthe air, then darted past the Fused and straight through the crack, close\nenough to the walls that he could feel them pass.\nHe broke out the other side, exhilarated. Should he have run out of\nStormlight by now? He didn’t use it up as quickly as he had during his early\nmonths training.\nKaladin dove along the slopes as three Fused popped out of the crack to\nfollow him. He led them around the base of the obsidian mountain, then\nwound back toward the Oathgate to check on Shallan and the others. As he\napproached, he let himself drop among the trees, still moving at incredible\nspeed. He oriented himself as if he were diving through the chasms.\nDodging these trees wasn’t so different from that.\nHe wove between them, using his body more than Lashings to control\nhis direction. His wake caused a melody of breaking glass. He exploded\nfree of the forest, and found the fourth Fused—the one with his harpoon—\nwaiting. The creature attacked, but Kaladin dodged and tore across the\nground until he was passing over the sea of beads.\nA quick glance showed him Shallan on the platform, waving her hands\nover her head—the prearranged signal that she needed more time.\nKaladin continued out over the sea, and beads reacted to his Stormlight,\nrattling and surging like a wave behind him. The last Fused slowed to hover\nin place, and the other three slowly emerged from the forest.\nKaladin spun in another loop, beads rising in the air behind him like a\ncolumn of water. He curved in an arc and came in toward the harpoon-\nwielding Fused. Kaladin slapped the parshman’s weapon aside, then swung\nthe butt of his own lance up, catching the harpoon on the haft while he\nkicked his enemy in the chest.\nThe harpoon went upward.

Other stones fell around it, opening a path out onto the wall.\nWhat was left of it.\nAbout fifteen feet from where she stood, the wall ended in a ragged,\nbroken gap. She coughed, then tucked back a lock of hair that had escaped\nher braid. They’d run for cover inside one of the stone guard towers along\nthe wall, but one side had collapsed in the shaking.\nIt had fallen on the three soldiers who had come to protect the queen.\nThe poor souls. Behind, Fen led her consort—who nursed a cut scalp—out\nover the rubble. Two other scribes had taken shelter with Navani and the\nqueen, but most of the admirals had run in the other direction, taking shelter\nin the next guard tower along.\nThat tower was now missing. The monster had swept it away. Now the\ncreature stomped across the plain outside, though Navani couldn’t see what\nhad drawn its attention.\n“The stairway,” Fen said, pointing. “Looks like it survived.”\nThe stairway down was fully enclosed in stone, and would lead into a\nsmall guard chamber at the bottom. Maybe they could find soldiers to help\nthe wounded and search the rubble for survivors. Navani pulled open the\ndoor, letting Fen and Kmakl head down first. Navani moved to follow, but\nhesitated.\nDamnation, that sight beyond the wall was mesmerizing. The red\nlightning storm. The two monsters of stone. And the boiling, churning red\nmist along the right coast. It had no distinct shape, but somehow gave the\nimpression of charging horses with the flesh ripped away.\nOne of the Unmade, certainly.

And then she\nnoticed something else. Something incongruous, something her mind\nrefused—at first—to accept. A solitary figure had somehow gotten around\nthe troops who had already entered the city. He now picked his way across\nthe rubble, wearing a blue uniform, carrying a book tucked under his arm.\nUnaided and defenseless, Dalinar Kholin stepped into the gap in the\nbroken wall, and there faced the nightmare alone.\n117. Champion with Nine Shadows\nBeware the otherworlders. The traitors. Those with tongues of\nsweetness, but with minds that lust for blood. Do not take them in. Do\nnot give them succor. Well were they named Voidbringers, for they\nbrought the void. The empty pit that sucks in emotion. A new god.\nTheir god.\n—From the Eila Stele\nDalinar stepped onto the rubble, boots scraping stone. The air felt too still\nout here near the red storm. Stagnant. How could the air be so motionless?\nAmaram’s army hesitated outside the gap. Some men had already gotten\nin, but the bulk had been forming up to wait their turn. When you rushed a\ncity like this, you wanted to be careful not to push your own forces too hard\nfrom behind, lest you crush them up against the enemy.\nThese kept uneven ranks, snarling, eyes red. More telling, they ignored\nthe wealth at their feet. A field of spheres and gemstones—all dun—that had\nbeen thrown out onto this plain by the thunderclast that destroyed the\nreserve.\nThey wanted blood instead. Dalinar could taste their lust for the fight,\nthe challenge. What held them back?\nTwin thunderclasts stomped toward the wall. A red haze drifted among\nthe men. Images of war and death. A deadly storm. Dalinar faced it alone.\nOne man. All that remained of a broken dream.\n“So…” a sudden voice said from his right. “What’s the plan?”\nDalinar frowned, then looked down to find a Reshi girl with long hair,\ndressed in a simple shirt and trousers.\n“Lift?” Dalinar asked in Azish. “Didn’t you leave?”\n“Sure did. What’s wrong with your army?”\n“They’re his now.”\n“Did you forget to feed them?”\nDalinar glanced at the soldiers, standing in ranks that felt more like\npacks than they did true battle formations. “Perhaps I didn’t try hard\nenough.”\n“Were you … thinkin’ you’d fight them all on your own?” Lift said.\n“With a book?”\n“There is someone else for me to fight here.”\n“… With a book?”\n“Yes.”\nShe shook her head. “Sure, all right. Why not? What do you want me to\ndo?”\nThe girl didn’t match the conventional ideal of a Knight Radiant. Not\neven five feet tall, thin and wiry, she looked more urchin than soldier.\nShe was also all he had.\n“Do you have a weapon?” he asked.\n“Nope. Can’t read.”\n“Can’t…” Dalinar looked down at his book. “I meant a real weapon,\nLift.”"

Yeah, I’ve got one a those.” She thrust her hand to the side. Mist\nformed into a small, glittering Shardblade.\n… Or no, it was just a pole. A silver pole with a rudimentary crossguard.\nLift shrugged. “Wyndle doesn’t like hurting people.”\nDoesn’t like … Dalinar blinked. What kind of world did he live in where\nswords didn’t like hurting people?\n“A Fused escaped from this city a short time ago,” Dalinar said,\n“carrying an enormous ruby. I don’t know why they wanted it, and I’d\nrather not find out. Can you steal it back?”\n“Sure. Easy.”\n“You’ll find it with a Fused who can move with a power similar to your\nown. A woman.”\n“Like I said. Easy.”\n“Easy? I think you might find—”\n“Relax, grandpa. Steal the rock. I can do that.” She took a deep breath,\nthen exploded with Stormlight. Her eyes turned a pearly, glowing white.\n“It’s just us two, then?”\n“Yes.”\n“Right. Good luck with the army.”\nDalinar looked back at the soldiers, where a figure materialized, wearing\ngold, holding a scepter like a cane.\n“It’s not the army that worries me,” Dalinar said. But Lift had already\nscampered away, hugging the wall and running quickly to round the outside\nof the army.\nOdium strolled up to Dalinar, trailed by a handful of Fused—plus the\nwoman Dalinar had sucked into his visions—and a shadowy spren that\nlooked like it was made of twisting smoke. What was that?\nOdium didn’t address Dalinar at first, but instead turned to his Fused.\n“Tell Yushah I want her to stay out here and guard the prison. Kai-garnis did\nwell destroying the wall; tell her to return to the city and climb toward the\nOathgate. If the Tisark can’t secure it, she is to destroy the device and\nrecover its gemstones. We can rebuild it as long as the spren aren’t\ncompromised.”\nTwo Fused left, each running toward one of the towering thunderclasts.\nOdium placed both hands on the top of his scepter and smiled at Dalinar.\n“Well, my friend. Here we are, and the time has arrived. Are you ready?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said.\n“Good, good. Let us begin.”\n* * *\nThe two Fused hovered near Adolin, out of easy reach, admiring Shallan’s\nillusory handiwork. He did his best to blend in, waving his harpoon around\ncrazily. He wasn’t sure where Syl had gone, but Pattern seemed to be\nenjoying himself, humming pleasantly and swinging a glass branch.\nOne of the Fused nudged the other, then pointed at Shallan, whom they’d\njust noticed. Neither appeared worried that she’d open the Oathgate—which\nwas a bad sign.

What did they know about the device that Adolin’s team did\nnot?\nThe Fused turned from Shallan and continued a conversation in a\nlanguage Adolin couldn’t understand. One pointed at each illusion in turn,\nthen thrust with his spear. The other shook her head, and Adolin could\nalmost interpret her answer. We tried stabbing each one. They keep mixing\nabout, so it’s hard to keep track.\nInstead, the female took out a knife and cut her hand, then flung it\ntoward the illusions. Orange blood fell through the illusions, leaving no\nstain, but splattered against Adolin’s cheek. Adolin felt his heart flutter, and\nhe tried to covertly wipe the blood off, but the female gestured toward him\nwith a satisfied grin. The male saluted her with a finger to his head, then\nlowered his lance and flew straight toward Adolin.\nDamnation.\nAdolin scrambled away, passing through an illusion of Captain Notum\nand causing it to diffuse. It formed back together, then blew apart a second\nlater as the Fused soared through it, lance pointed at Adolin’s back.\nAdolin spun and flung his harpoon up to block, deflecting the lance, but\nthe Fused still smashed into him, tossing him backward. Adolin hit the\nstone bridge hard, smacking his head, seeing stars.\nVision swimming, he reached for his harpoon, but the Fused slapped the\nweapon away with the butt of his lance. The creature then alighted softly on\nthe bridge, billowing robes settling.\nAdolin yanked out his belt knife, then forced himself to his feet,\nunsteady. The Fused lowered its lance to a two-handed, underarm grip, then\nwaited.\nKnife against spear. Adolin breathed in and out, worried about the other\nFused—who had gone for Shallan. He tried to dredge up Zahel’s lessons,\nremembering days on the practice yard running this exact exchange.\nJakamav had refused the training, laughing at the idea that a Shardbearer\nwould ever fight knife to spear.\nAdolin flipped the knife to grip it point down, then held it forward so he\ncould deflect the spear thrusts. Zahel whispered to him. Wait until the\nenemy thrusts with the spear, deflect it or dodge it, then grab the spear with\nyour left hand. Pull yourself close enough to ram the knife into the enemy’s\nneck.\nRight. He could do that.\nHe’d “died” seven times out of ten doing it against Zahel, of course.\nWinds bless you anyway, you old axehound, he thought. Adolin stepped\nin, testing, and waited for the thrust. When it came, Adolin shoved the\nlance’s point aside with his knife, then grabbed at—\nThe enemy floated backward in an unnatural motion, too fast—no\nordinary human could have moved in such a way. Adolin stumbled, trying\nto reassess. The Fused idly brought the lance back around, then fluidly\nrammed it right through Adolin’s stomach.\nAdolin gasped at the sharp spike of pain, doubling over, feeling blood on\nhis hands.

He\nadvanced, slapped away Adolin’s weak attempt at a parry, and raised the\nsword to strike.\nSomeone leaped onto the Fused from behind.\nA figure in tattered clothing, a scrabbling, angry woman with brown\nvines instead of skin and scratched-out eyes. Adolin gaped as his deadeye\nraked long nails across the Fused’s face, causing him to stumble backward,\nhumming of all things. He rammed his sword into the spren’s chest, but it\ndidn’t faze her in the least. She just let out a screech like the one she’d\nmade at Adolin when he’d tried to summon his Blade, and kept attacking.\nAdolin shook himself. Flee, idiot!\nHolding his wounded gut—each step causing a shock of pain—he\nlurched across the bridge toward Shallan.\n* * *\nEmploying subterfuge will not deceive us or weaken our resolve,\nLightweaver, the guardians said. For indeed, this is not a matter of decision,\nbut one of nature. The path remains closed.\nShallan let the illusion melt around her, then slumped down, exhausted.\nShe’d tried pleading, cajoling, yelling, and even Lightweaving. It was no\nuse. She had failed. Her illusions on the bridge were wavering and\nvanishing, their Stormlight running out.\nThrough them shot a Fused trailing dark energy, lance leveled directly\ntoward Shallan. She dove to the side, barely getting out of the way. The\ncreature passed in a whoosh, then slowed and turned for another pass.\nShallan leaped to her feet first. “Pattern!” she yelled, sweeping her hands\nforward by instinct, trying to summon the Blade. A part of her was\nimpressed that was her reaction. Adolin would be proud.\nIt didn’t work, of course. Pattern shouted in apology from the bridge,\npanicked. And yet in that moment—facing the enemy bearing down, its\nlance pointed at her heart—Shallan felt something. Pattern, or something\nlike him, just beyond her mental reach. On the other side, and if she could\njust tug on it, feed it …\nShe screamed as Stormlight flowed through her, raging in her veins,\nreaching toward something in her pocket.\nA wall appeared in front of her.\nShallan gasped. A sickening smack from the other side of the wall\nindicated that the Fused had collided with it.\nA wall. A storming wall of worked stones, broken at the sides. Shallan\nlooked down and found that her pocket—she was still wearing Veil’s white\ntrousers—was connected to the strange wall.\nWhat on Roshar? She pulled out her small knife and sawed the pocket\nfree, then stumbled back. In the center of the wall was a small bead, melded\ninto the stone.\nThat’s the bead I used to cross the sea down below, Shallan thought.\nWhat she’d done felt like Soulcasting, yet different.\nPattern ran up to her, humming as he left the bridge. Where were Adolin\nand Syl?"

Where were Adolin\nand Syl?\n“I took the soul of the wall,” Shallan said, “and then made its physical\nform appear on this side.”\n“Mmm. I think these beads are more minds than souls, but you did\nmanifest it here. Very nice. Though your touch is unpracticed. Mmm. It will\nnot stay for long.”\nThe edges were already starting to unravel to smoke. A scraping sound\non the other side indicated that the Fused had not been defeated, merely\nstunned. Shallan turned from it and scrambled over the bridge, away from\nthe towering sentinels. She passed some of her illusions and recovered a\nlittle of their Stormlight. Now, where was—\nAdolin. Bleeding!\nShallan dashed over and grabbed him by the arm, trying to keep him\nupright as he stumbled.\n“It’s just a little cut,” he said. Blood seeped out between his fingers,\nwhich were pressed to his gut, right below the navel. The back of his\nuniform was bloody too.\n“Just a little cut? Adolin! You—”\n“No time,” he said, leaning against her. He nodded toward the Fused\nshe’d fought, who rose into the air over Shallan’s wall. “The other one is\nback behind me somewhere. Could be on us at any moment.”\n“Kaladin,” Shallan said. “Where—”\n“Mmm…” Pattern said, pointing. “He ran out of Stormlight and fell into\nthe beads over that way.”\nGreat.\n“Take a deep breath,” Shallan said to Adolin, then pulled him off the\nbridge with her and leaped for the beads.\n* * *\nLift became awesome.\nHer powers manifested as the ability to slide across objects without truly\ntouching them. She could become really, really slick—which was handy,\nbecause soldiers tried to snatch her as she rounded the Alethi army. They\ngrabbed at her unbuttoned overshirt, her arm, her hair. They couldn’t hold\nher. She just slid away. It was like they were trying to grab hold of a song.\nShe burst from their ranks and fell to her knees, which she’d slicked up\nreal good. That meant she kept going, sliding on her knees away from the\nmen with the glowing red eyes. Wyndle—who she knew by now was\nalmost certainly not a Voidbringer—was a little snaking line of green beside\nher. He looked like a fast-growing vine, jutting with small crystals here and\nthere.\n“Oh, I don’t like this,” he said.\n“You don’t like nothin’.”\n“Now, that is not true, mistress. I liked that nice town we passed back in\nAzir.”\n“The one that was deserted?”\n“So peaceful.”\nThere, Lift thought, picking out a real Voidbringer—the type that looked\nlike parshmen, only big and scary. This one was a woman, and moved\nacross the rock smoothly, like she was awesome too.\n“I’ve always wondered,” Lift said. “Do you suppose they got those\nmarble colorings on all their parts?”\n“Mistress?

She kept her\nlegs slick, but her hands not slick, which let her paddle and steer herself.\nGoing about on your knees didn’t look as deevy as standing up—but when\nshe tried being awesome while standing, she usually ended up crashed\nagainst a rock with her butt in the air.\nThat Fused did seem to be carrying something large in one hand. Like a\nbig gemstone. Lift paddled in that direction—which was taking her\ndangerously close to that parshman army and their ships. Still, she got up\npretty close before the Voidbringer woman turned and noticed.\nLift slid to a halt, letting her Stormlight run out. Her stomach growled,\nso she took a bite of some jerky she’d found in her guard’s pocket.\nThe Voidbringer said something in a singsong voice, hefting the\nenormous ruby—it didn’t have any Stormlight, which was good, since one\nthat big would have been bright. Like, redder and brighter than Gawx’s face\nwhen Lift told him about how babies was made. He should know stuff like\nthat already. He’d been a starvin’ thief! Hadn’t he known any whores or\nanything?\nAnyway … how to get that ruby? The Voidbringer spoke again, and\nwhile Lift couldn’t figure out the words, she couldn’t help feeling that the\nVoidbringer sounded amused. The woman pushed off with one foot, then\nslid on the other, easy as if she were standing on oil. She coasted for a\nsecond, then looked over her shoulder and grinned before kicking off and\nsliding to the left, casually moving with a grace that made Lift seem super\nstupid.\n“Well starve me,” Lift said. “She’s more awesome than I am.”\n“Do you have to use that term?” Wyndle asked. “Yes, she appears to be\nable to access the Surge of—”\n“Shut it,” Lift said. “Can you follow her?”\n“I might leave you behind.”\n“I’ll keep up.” Maybe. “You follow her. I’ll follow you.”\nWyndle sighed but obeyed, streaking off after the Voidbringer. Lift\nfollowed, paddling on her knees, feeling like a pig trying to imitate a\nprofessional dancer.\n* * *\n“You must choose, Szeth-son-Neturo,” Nin said. “The Skybreakers will\nswear to the Dawnsingers and their law. And you? Will you join us?”\nWind rippled Szeth’s clothing. All those years ago, he’d been correct.\nThe Voidbringers had returned.\nNow … now he was to simply accept their rule?\n“I don’t trust myself, aboshi,” Szeth whispered. “I cannot see the right\nany longer. My own decisions are not trustworthy.”\n“Yes,” Nin said, nodding, hands clasped behind his back. “Our minds are\nfallible. This is why we must pick something external to follow. Only in\nstrict adherence to a code can we approximate justice.”\nSzeth inspected the battlefield far below.\nWhen are we going to actually fight someone? asked the sword on his\nback.

A hidden fire.\n“You followed men before,” Nin continued. “They caused your pain,\nSzeth-son-Neturo. Your agony is because you did not follow something\nunchanging and pure. You picked men instead of an ideal.”\n“Or,” Szeth said, “perhaps I was simply forced to follow the wrong\nmen.”\n* * *\nKaladin thrashed in the beads, suffocating, coughing. He wasn’t that deep,\nbut which way … which way was out? Which way was out?\nFrantic, he tried to swim toward the surface, but the beads didn’t move\nlike water, and he couldn’t propel himself. Beads slipped into his mouth,\npushed at his skin. Pulled at him like an invisible hand. Trying to drag him\nfarther and farther into the depths.\nAway from the light. Away from the wind.\nHis fingers brushed something warm and soft among the beads. He\nthrashed, trying to find it again, and a hand seized his arm. He brought his\nother arm around and grabbed hold of a thin wrist. Another hand took him\nby the front of the coat, pulling him away from the darkness, and he\nstumbled, finding purchase on the bottom of the sea.\nLungs burning, he followed, step by step, eventually bursting from the\nbeads to find Syl pulling him by the front of the coat. She led him up the\nbank, where he collapsed in a heap, spitting out spheres and wheezing. The\nFused he’d been fighting landed on the Oathgate platform near the two\nthey’d left behind.\nAs Kaladin was recovering his breath, beads nearby pulled back,\nrevealing Shallan, Adolin, and Pattern crossing the seafloor through some\nkind of passage she’d made. A hallway in the depths? She was growing in\nher ability to manipulate the beads.\nAdolin was wounded. Kaladin gritted his teeth, forcing himself to his\nfeet and stumbling over to help Shallan get the prince up onto the shore.\nThe prince lay on his back, cursing softly, holding his gut with bloodied\nhands.\n“Let me see it,” Kaladin said, prying Adolin’s fingers out of the way.\n“The blood—” Shallan started.\n“The blood is the least of his worries,” Kaladin said, prodding at the\nwound. “He’s not going to bleed out from a gut wound anytime soon, but\nsepsis is another story.

They\nignored him—and unfortunately, he had to ignore them.\n“So, child…” Odium nodded toward the city, and took Dalinar by the\nshoulder. “You did something marvelous in forging that coalition. You\nshould feel proud. I’m certainly proud.”\nHow could Dalinar fight this thing, who thought of every possibility,\nwho planned for every outcome? How could he face something so vast, so\nincredible? Touching it, Dalinar could sense it stretching into infinity.\nPermeating the land, the people, the sky and the stone.\nHe would break, go insane, if he tried to comprehend this being. And\nsomehow he had to defeat it?\nConvince him that he can lose, the Almighty had said in vision. Appoint\na champion. He will take that chance.… This is the best advice I can give\nyou.\nHonor had been slain resisting this thing.\nDalinar licked his lips. “A test of champions,” he said to Odium. “I\ndemand that we clash over this world.”\n“For what purpose?” Odium asked.\n“Killing us won’t free you, will it?” Dalinar said. “You could rule us or\ndestroy us, but either way, you’d still be trapped here.”\nNearby, one of the thunderclasts climbed over the wall and entered the\ncity. The other stayed behind, stomping around near the rearguard of the\narmy.\n“A contest,” Dalinar said to Odium. “Your freedom if you win, our lives\nif humans win.”\n“Be careful what you request, Dalinar Kholin. As Bondsmith, you can\noffer this deal. But is this truly what you wish of me?”\n“I…”\nWas it?\n* * *\nWyndle followed the Voidbringer, and Lift followed him.

She ran for a moment, then slicked the bottoms of her feet and\nwent into a slide.\nThe Voidbringer woman passed ahead. She didn’t slip and fall, but\nperformed this strange walking motion—one that let her control her smooth\nglide.\nLift tried to do the same.

She could\n—\nSomething crashed to the ground nearby, crushing several soldiers,\nthrowing Lift off balance and sending her into a heap. She slid to a stop and\nrolled over, looking up at one of the huge stone monsters. The skeletal thing\nraised a spiked hand and slammed it down.\nLift threw herself out of the way, but the shaking from the impact sent\nher sprawling again. Soldiers nearby didn’t seem to care that their fellows\nhad been crushed. Eyes glowing, they scrambled for her, as if it were a\ncontest to see who could kill her first.\nHer only choice was to dodge toward the stone monster. Maybe she\ncould get so close that it—\nThe creature pounded again, mashing three soldiers, but also slamming\ninto Lift. The blow snapped her legs in the blink of an eye, then crushed her\nlower half, sending her into a screaming fit of pain. Eyes watering, she\ncurled up on the ground.\nHeal. Heal.\nJust had to weather the pain. Just had to …\nStones ground against one another overhead. She blinked away tears,\nlooking up at the creature raising its spike high in the sky, toward the sun,\nwhich was slipping behind the clouds of the deadly storm.\n“Mistress!” Wyndle said. His vines climbed over her, as if trying to\ncradle her. “Oh, mistress. Summon me as a sword!”\nThe pain in her legs started to fade. Too slowly. She was growing hungry\nagain, her Stormlight running low. She summoned Wyndle as a rod,\ntwisting against the pain and holding him toward the monster, her eyes\nwatering with the effort.\nAn explosion of light appeared overhead, a ball of expanding Radiance."

She couldn’t move on, no matter how\ndesperate her task, until she’d done it.\nShe seized the bowl and turned it until she found the woman depicting\nher, marked by the iconography of the brush and the mask, symbols of\ncreativity. Pure absurdity. She pulled out her knife and sawed at the metal\nuntil she’d managed to scratch out the face.\nGood enough. Good enough.\nShe dropped the brazier. Keep going. What that man, Mraize, had told\nher had better be true. If he had lied …\nThe large tent near the wall was completely unguarded, though soldiers\nhad run past her a short time ago, eyes glowing with the light of corrupted\nInvestiture.

Terrible.\nAnd how had he managed to start a storm of his own?\nWell, this land was finally doomed. And Ash … Ash couldn’t find it\ninside herself to care any longer. She pushed into the tent, forcibly keeping\nherself from looking at the rug in case it bore depictions of the Heralds.\nThere she found him, sitting alone in the dim light, staring ahead\nsightlessly. Dark skin, even darker than hers, and a muscled physique. A\nking, for all the fact that he’d never worn a crown. He was the one of the\nten who was never supposed to have borne their burden.\nAnd he’d borne it the longest anyway.\n“Taln,” she whispered.\n* * *\nRenarin Kholin knew he wasn’t actually a Knight Radiant. Glys had once\nbeen a different kind of spren, but something had changed him, corrupted\nhim.

Renarin could feel the spren\ntrembling inside him, hiding and whispering about the danger. Jasnah had\nfound them.\nRenarin had seen that coming.\nHe knelt in the ancient temple of Pailiah, and to his eyes it was full of\ncolors. A thousand panes of stained glass sprouted on the walls, combining\nand melting together, creating a panorama. He saw himself coming to\nThaylen City earlier in the day. He saw Dalinar talking to the monarchs, and\nthen he saw them turning against him.\nShe will hurt us! She will hurt us!\n“I know, Glys,” he whispered, turning toward a specific section of\nstained glass. This showed Renarin kneeling on the floor of the temple. In\nthe sequence of stained glass panels, Jasnah approached him from behind,\nsword raised.\nAnd then … she struck him down.\nRenarin couldn’t control what he saw or when he saw it.

You were not beguiled or tricked in any way?”\n“A contest of champions. For the fate of Roshar.”\n“Very well,” Odium said, then sighed softly. “I agree.”\n“That easily?”\n“Oh, I assure you. This won’t be easy.” Odium raised his eyebrows in an\nopen, inviting way. A concerned expression. “I have chosen my champion\nalready. I’ve been preparing him for a long, long time.”\n“Amaram.”\n“Him? A passionate man, yes, but hardly suited to this task. No, I need\nsomeone who dominates a battlefield like the sun dominates the sky.”\nThe Thrill suddenly returned to Dalinar. The red mist—which had been\nfading—roared back to life. Images filled his mind. Memories of his youth\nspent fighting.\n“I need someone stronger than Amaram,” Odium whispered.\n“No.”\n“A man who will win no matter the cost.”\nThe Thrill overwhelmed Dalinar, choking him.\n“A man who has served me all his life. A man I trust. I believe I warned\nyou that I knew you’d make the right decision.

Impossible.\nAnd so he put his trust in someone else, someone whose light peeked\nthrough the shadow.\nDalinar Kholin. Knight Radiant. He would know.\nThis choice was not perfect. But … Stones Unhallowed … it was the\nbest he could manage. It brought him some small measure of peace as he\nswept through the enemy army.\nThe sword screamed at him. DESTROY!\nAnyone he so much as nicked popped into black smoke. Szeth laid waste\nto the red-eyed soldiers, who kept coming, showing no fear. Screaming, as\nif they thirsted for death.\nIt was a drink that Szeth was all too good at serving.\nHe wielded Stormlight in one hand, Lashing any men who drew too\nclose, sending them flipping into the air or crashing backward into their\nfellows. With the other hand he swept the sword through their ranks. He\nmoved on nimble feet, his own body Lashed upward just enough to lighten\nhim.

She pulled him tight as he wept,\nsobbing, at his failure.\n* * *\nJasnah raised her Blade over Renarin’s head.\nMake it quick. Make it painless.\nMost threats to a dynasty came from within.\nRenarin was obviously corrupted. She’d known there was a problem the\nmoment she’d read that he had predicted the Everstorm. Now, Jasnah had to\nbe strong. She had to do what was right, even when it was so, so hard.\nShe prepared to swing, but then Renarin turned and looked at her. Tears\nstreaming down his face, he met her eyes, and he nodded.\nSuddenly they were young again. He was a trembling child, weeping on\nher shoulder for a father who didn’t seem to be able to feel love. Little\nRenarin, always so solemn. Always misunderstood, laughed at and\ncondemned by people who said similar things about Jasnah behind her\nback.\nJasnah froze, as if standing at the edge of a cliff. Wind blew through the\ntemple, carrying with it a pair of spren in the form of golden spheres,\nbobbing in the currents.\nJasnah dismissed her sword.\n“Jasnah?” Ivory said, appearing back in the form of a man, clinging to\nher collar.\nJasnah fell to her knees, then pulled Renarin into an embrace. He broke\ndown crying, like he had as a boy, burying his head in her shoulder.\n“What’s wrong with me?” Renarin asked. “Why do I see these things? I\nthought I was doing something right, with Glys, but somehow it’s all\nwrong.…”\n“Hush,” Jasnah whispered. “We’ll find a way through it, Renarin.\nWhatever it is, we’ll fix it. We’ll survive this, somehow.”"

The god frowned. His Fused companions shied back, and Amaram\nraised a hand before his eyes and squinted.\nWere those gloryspren spinning around Dalinar?\n“I did kill the people of Rathalas,” Dalinar shouted. “You might have\nbeen there, but I made the choice. I decided!” He stilled. “I killed her. It\nhurts so much, but I did it. I accept that. You cannot have her. You cannot\ntake her from me again.”\n“Dalinar,” Odium said. “What do you hope to gain, keeping this\nburden?”\nDalinar sneered at the god. “If I pretend … If I pretend I didn’t do those\nthings, it means that I can’t have grown to become someone else.”\n“A failure.”\nSomething stirred inside of Dalinar.

She ran across each of these, then leaped down\nto the next street.\nRenarin struggled to follow, afraid of his weakness, confused by the\nthings he’d seen. He dropped to a rooftop, feeling sudden pain at the fall—\nthough Stormlight healed that. He limped after her until the pain left.\n“Jasnah!” he called. “Jasnah, I can’t keep up!”\nShe stopped at the edge of a rooftop. He reached her, and she took his\narm. “You can keep up, Renarin. You’re a Knight Radiant.”\n“I don’t think I’m a Radiant, Jasnah. I don’t know what I am.”\nAn entire stream of gloryspren flew past them, hundreds in a sweeping\nformation that curved toward the base of the city. Something was glowing\ndown there, a beacon in the dim light of an overcast city.\n“I know what you are,” Jasnah said. “You’re my cousin. Family,\nRenarin. Hold my hand.

And\nwithin it a simple, quiet voice. A woman’s voice, so familiar to him.\nI forgive you.\nDalinar opened his eyes, and knew what the parshwoman saw in him.\nSwirling clouds, glowing light, thunder and lightning.\n“I am Unity.”\nHe slammed both hands together.\nAnd combined three realms into one.\n* * *\nShadesmar exploded with light.\nFused screamed as a wind blasted them away, though Kaladin felt\nnothing.

The Thrill had\nDalinar most worried, however. He knew what it could do.\nHe glanced down at his arm, and noticed something. The lightning that\nhad struck him earlier, shredding The Way of Kings, had broken his arm\nfabrial. The clasp was undone, and Dalinar could see the tiny gemstones\nNavani had placed to power it.\n“Sir?” Kaladin asked again.\n“The enemy is trying to crush this city, Captain,” Dalinar said, lowering\nhis arm. “We’re going to hold it against his forces.”\n“Seven Radiants?” Jasnah said, skeptical. “Uncle, that seems a tall order,\neven if one of us is—apparently—the storming Assassin in White.”\n“I serve Dalinar Kholin,” Szeth-son-son-Vallano whispered.

Even with the\nEverstorm dominating the sun, this place felt so much more bright than\nShadesmar. A group of windspren dodged around him, though the air was\nrelatively still. Perhaps they were the ones who had come to him on the\nother side, the ones he had failed.\nKaladin, Syl said. You don’t need another reason to berate yourself.\nShe was right. Storms, he could be down on himself sometimes. Was that\nthe flaw that had prevented him from speaking the Words of the Fourth\nIdeal?\nFor some reason, Syl sighed. Oh, Kaladin.\n“We’ll talk about it later,” he said.\nFor now, he’d been given a second chance to protect Dalinar Kholin.\nStormlight raging inside of him, the Sylspear a comfortable weight in his\nhand, he Lashed himself downward and crashed to the stones near Amaram.\nThe highlord, in turn, fell to his knees.\nWhat? Kaladin thought. Amaram was coughing. He tipped his head\nback, faceplate up, and groaned.\nHad he just swallowed something?\n* * *\nAdolin prodded at his stomach.

His father had been\nfocused on the Radiants, and had neglected to give Adolin a specific duty.\nSo maybe he could help the defenders inside.\nAdolin picked his way across the rubble and through the broken wall.\nJasnah stood right inside, hands on hips, as if she were surveying a mess left\nby rampaging children. The gap opened into an unremarkable city square\ndominated by barracks and storehouses. Fallen troops wearing either\nThaylen or Sadeas uniforms indicated a recent clash here, but most of the\nenemy seemed to have moved on. Shouts and clangs sounded from nearby\nstreets.\nAdolin reached for a discarded sword, then paused, and—feeling a fool\n—summoned his Shardblade. He braced himself for a scream, but none\ncame, and the Blade fell into his hand after ten heartbeats.\n“I’m sorry,” he said, lifting the glistening weapon. “And thank you.”\nHe headed toward one of the nearby clashes, where men were shouting\nfor help.\n* * *\nSzeth of the Skybreakers envied Kaladin, the one they called Stormblessed,\nin the honor of protecting Dalinar Kholin.

These were the shadows in the darkness, the ones he heard whispering\nof his murders. How she brought them to life, he did not know. He landed\nnear the Reshi Surgebinder, Lift.\n“So,” she said to him. “How do we find that ruby?”\nSzeth pointed with his sheathed Shardblade toward the ships docked in\nthe bay. “The creature carrying it ran back that way.” The parshmen still"

You aren’t evil. You’re\nnice. And I don’t eat people.\n“I will not draw the sword,” Szeth said, “unless you are already dead and\nI decide to accept death myself.”\n“Greaaaaaaaaaaat,” Lift said.\nYou’re supposed to contradict me, Szeth, the sword said, when I say I\ndon’t eat people. Vasher always did. I think he was joking. Anyway, as\npeople who have carried me go, you aren’t very good at this.\n“No,” Szeth said. “I am not good at being a person. It is … a failing of\nmine.”\nIt’s all right! Be happy. Looks like there’s a lot of evil to slay today!\nThat’s greaaaaaaaaaaat, right?\nThen the sword started humming.\n* * *\nThe brands on Kaladin’s head seemed a fresh pain as he dove to strike\nAmaram. But Amaram recovered quickly from his fit, then slammed his\nfaceplate down. He rebuffed Kaladin’s attack with an armored forearm.\nThose red eyes cast a crimson glow through the helm’s slit. “You should\nthank me, boy.”\n“Thank you?” Kaladin said. “For what? For showing me that a person\ncould be even more loathsome than the petty lighteyes who ruled my\nhometown?”\n“I created you, spearman. I forged you.” Amaram pointed at Kaladin\nwith the wide, hook-ended Shardblade. Then he extended his left hand,\nsummoning a second Blade. Long and curved, the back edge rippled like\nflowing waves.\nKaladin knew that Blade well. He’d won it—saving Amaram’s life—\nthen refused to bear it. For when he looked at his reflection in the silvery\nmetal, all he could see were the friends it had killed. So much death and\npain, caused by that rippling Blade.\nIt seemed a symbol of all he’d lost, particularly held now in the hand of\nthe man who had lied to him. The man who had taken Tien away.\nAmaram presented a sword stance, holding two Blades. One taken in\nbloodshed, at the cost of Kaladin’s crew. The other, Oathbringer. A sword\ngiven to ransom Bridge Four.\nDon’t be intimidated! Syl whispered in Kaladin’s mind. History\nnotwithstanding, he’s only a man. And you’re a Knight Radiant.\nThe vambrace of Amaram’s armor pulsed suddenly on his forearm, as if\nsomething were pushing it from beneath. The red glow from the helm\ndeepened, and Kaladin got the distinct impression of something enveloping\nAmaram.\nA black smoke. The same that Kaladin had seen surrounding Queen\nAesudan at the end, as they’d fled the palace. Other sections of Amaram’s\narmor began to rattle or pulse, and he suddenly moved with a violent burst\nof speed, swinging with one Shardblade, then the other.\n* * *"

The red mist\nchurned and boiled here, nearly solid. He saw familiar faces reflected in it.\nHe watched the old highprince Kalanor fall from the heights of a rock\nformation. He saw himself fight alone on a field of stone after a rockslide.\nHe watched as he caught the claw of a chasmfiend on the Shattered Plains.\nHe could hear the Thrill. A thrumming, insistent, warming pulse. Almost\nlike the beating of a drum.\n“Hello, old friend,” Dalinar whispered, then stepped into the red mist.\n* * *\nShallan stood with arms outstretched. Stormlight expanded from her on the\nground, a pool of liquid light, radiant mist swirling above it. It became a\ngateway. From it, her collection emerged.\nEvery person she’d ever sketched—from the maids in her father’s house\nto the honorspren who had held Syl captive—grew from Stormlight. Men\nand women, children and grandparents. Soldiers and scribes. Mothers and\nscouts, kings and slaves.\nMmm, Pattern said as a sword in her hand. MMMMMMM.\n“I’ve lost these,” Shallan said as Yalb the sailor climbed from the mist\nand waved to her. He drew a glowing Shardspear from the air. “I lost these\npictures!”\nYou are close to them, Pattern said. Close to the realm of thought … and\nbeyond. All the people you’ve Connected to, over the years …\nHer brothers emerged. She’d buried worries about them in the back of\nher mind. Held by the Ghostbloods … No word from any spanreed she\ntried …\nHer father stepped from the Light. And her mother.\nThe illusions immediately started to fail, melting back to Light. Then,\nsomeone seized her by the left hand.\nShallan gasped. Forming from mist was … was Veil? With long straight\nblack hair, white clothing, brown eyes. Wiser than Shallan—and more\nfocused. Capable of working on small pieces when Shallan grew\noverwhelmed by the large scale of her work.\nAnother hand took Shallan’s on the right. Radiant, in glowing garnet\nShardplate, tall, with braided hair. Reserved and cautious. She nodded to\nShallan with a steady, determined look.\nOthers boiled at Shallan’s feet, trying to crawl from the Stormlight, their\nglowing hands grabbing at her legs.\n“… No,” Shallan whispered.\nThis was enough. She had created Veil and Radiant to be strong when\nshe was weak. She squeezed their hands tight, then hissed out slowly. The\nother versions of Shallan retreated into the Stormlight.\nThen, farther out, figures by the hundred surged from the ground and\nraised weapons at the enemy.\n* * *\nAdolin, now accompanied by some two dozen soldiers, charged through the\nstreets of the Low Ward.\n“There!” one of his men shouted with a thick Thaylen accent.\n“Brightlord!” He pointed toward a group of enemy soldiers disappearing\ndown an alley back toward the wall."

He charged down\nthe alleyway to—\nA soldier with red eyes suddenly hurtled through the air overhead.\nAdolin ducked, worried about Fused, but it was an ordinary soldier. The\nunfortunate man crashed into a rooftop. What on Roshar?\nAs they approached the end of the alleyway, another body smashed into\nthe wall right by the opening. Gripping his Shardblade, Adolin peeked\naround the corner, expecting to find another stone monster like the one that\nhad climbed into the Ancient Ward.\nInstead, he found only Jasnah Kholin, looking completely nonplussed. A\nglow faded around her, different from the smoke of her Stormlight. Like\ngeometric shapes outlining her …\nAll right then. Jasnah didn’t need help. Adolin instead waved for his men\nto follow the sounds of battle to the right. There they found a small group of\nbeleaguered Thaylen soldiers backed up against the base of the wall, facing\na much larger force of men in green uniforms.\nWell. This Adolin could fix.\nHe waved his own soldiers back, then charged the enemy in\nSmokestance, sweeping with his Shardblade. The enemy had packed in\nclose to try to get at their prey, and had a hard time adjusting to the\nminiature storm that crashed into them from behind.\nAdolin stepped through the sequence of swipes, feeling immense\nsatisfaction at finally being able to do something. The Thaylens let out a\ncheer as he dropped the last group of enemies, red eyes going black as they\nburned out. His satisfaction lasted until, glancing down at the corpses, he\nwas struck by how human they looked.\nHe’d spent years fighting Parshendi. He didn’t think he’d actually killed\nanother Alethi since … well, he couldn’t remember.\nSadeas. Don’t forget Sadeas.\nFifty men dead at his feet, and some three dozen killed while gathering\nhis other troops. Storms … after feeling so useless in Shadesmar, now this.\nHow much of his reputation was him, and how much of it was—and had\nalways been—the sword?\n“Prince Adolin?” a voice called in Alethi. “Your Highness!”\n“Kdralk?” Adolin said as a figure emerged from the Thaylens. The\nqueen’s son had seen better days. His eyebrows were bloodied from a cut\nacross his forehead. His uniform was torn, and there was a bandage on his\nupper arm.\n“My mother and father,” Kdralk said. “They’re trapped on the wall a\nlittle farther down. We were pushing to reach them, but we got cornered.”\n“Right. Let’s move, then.”\n* * *\nJasnah stepped over a corpse. Her Blade vanished in a puff of Stormlight,\nand Ivory appeared next to her, his oily black features concerned as he\nregarded the sky. “This place is three, still,” he said. “Almost three.”"

Another batch of\ngloryspren flocked past, and she could see them as they were in the\nCognitive Realm: like strange avians with long wings, and a golden sphere\nin place of the head. Well, being able to see into the Cognitive Realm\nwithout trying was one of the least unnerving things that had happened so\nfar today.\nAn incredible amount of Stormlight thrummed inside her—more than\nshe’d ever held before. Another group of soldiers broke through Shallan’s\nillusions and charged over the rubble through the gap in the wall. Jasnah\ncasually flipped her hand toward them. Once, their souls would have\nresisted mightily. Soulcasting living things was difficult; it usually required\ncare and concentration—along with proper knowledge and procedure.\nToday, the men puffed away to smoke at her barest thought. It was so\neasy that a part of her was horrified.\nShe felt invincible, which was a danger in itself. The human body wasn’t\nmeant to be stuffed this full of Stormlight. It rose from her like smoke from\na bonfire. Dalinar had closed his perpendicularity, however. He had been the\nstorm, and had somehow recharged the spheres—but like a storm, his\neffects were passing.\n“Three worlds,” Ivory said. “Slowly splitting apart again, but for now,\nthree realms are close.”\n“Then let’s make use of it before it fades, shall we?”\nShe stepped up before the rent portion of the wall, a gap as wide as a\nsmall city block.\nThen raised her hands.\n* * *\nSzeth of the Skybreakers led the way toward the parshman army, the child\nEdgedancer following.\nSzeth feared not pain, as no physical agony could rival the pain he\nalready bore. He feared not death. That sweet reward had already been\nsnatched from him. He feared only that he had made the wrong choice.\nSzeth expunged that fear. Nin was correct. Life could not be lived\nmaking decisions at each juncture.\nThe parshmen standing on the shore of the bay did not have glowing\neyes. They looked much like the Parshendi who had used him to assassinate\nKing Gavilar. When he drew close, several of them ran off and boarded one\nof the ships.\n“There,” he said. “I suspect they are going to warn the one we seek.”\n“I’m after it, crazyface,” Lift said. “Sword, don’t eat anyone unless they\ntry to eat you first.” She zipped off in her silly way—kneeling and slapping\nher hands on the ground. She slid among the parshmen. When she reached\nthe ship, she somehow scrambled up its side, then squeezed through a tiny\nporthole.\nThe parshmen here didn’t seem aggressive. They shied away from Szeth,\nmurmuring among themselves. Szeth glanced at the sky and picked out Nin\n—as a speck—still watching. Szeth could not fault the Herald’s decision;\nthe law of these creatures was now the law of the land.\nBut … that law was the product of the many. Szeth had been exiled"

He had served master after master,\nmost of them using him to attain terrible or at least selfish goals. You could\nnot arrive at excellence by the average of these people. Excellence was an\nindividual quest, not a group effort.\nA flying Parshendi—“Fused” was a term Lift had used for them—shot\nout of the ship, carrying the large dun ruby that Dalinar sought. Lift\nfollowed the Fused out, but couldn’t fly. She clambered up onto the prow of\nthe ship, releasing a loud string of curses.\nWow, the sword said. That’s impressive vocabulary for a child. Does she\neven know what that last one means?\nSzeth Lashed himself into the air after the Fused.\nIf she does know what it means, the sword added, do you think she’d tell\nme?\nThe enemy swooped down low across the battlefield, and Szeth\nfollowed, a mere inch above the rocks. They soon passed among the\nfighting illusions. Some of these appeared as enemy soldiers, to further add\nconfusion. A clever move. The enemy would be less likely to retreat if they\nthought most of their companions were still fighting, and it made the battle\nlook far more real. Except that when Szeth’s quarry zipped past, her\nfluttering robes struck and disturbed illusory shapes.\nSzeth followed close, passing through a pair of fighting men he had seen\nwere illusions. This Fused was talented, better than the Skybreakers had\nbeen, though Szeth had not faced their best.\nThe chase took him in a long loop, eventually swinging back down near\nwhere Dalinar was walking through the edge of the red mist. The whispered\nvoices grew louder, and Szeth put his hands to his ears as he flew.\nThe Fused was smooth and graceful, but sped up and slowed less quickly\nthan Szeth did. He took advantage of this, anticipating the enemy’s move,\nthen cutting to the side as they turned. Szeth collided with the enemy, and\nthey twisted in the air. The Fused—gemstone in one hand—stabbed Szeth\nwith a wicked knife.\nFortunately, with Stormlight, that didn’t do anything but cause pain.\nSzeth Lashed them both downward, holding tight, and sent them\ncrashing to the stone. The gemstone rolled free as the Fused groaned. Szeth\nLashed himself gracefully to his feet, then slipped along the stone at a\nstanding glide. He scooped up the ruby with his free hand, the one not\ncarrying his sheathed sword.\nWow, the sword said.\n“Thank you, sword-nimi,” Szeth said. He restored his Stormlight from\nnearby fallen spheres and gemstones.\nI meant that. To your right.\nThree more Fused were swooping down toward him. He appeared to\nhave gotten the enemy’s attention.\n* * *\nAdolin and his men reached a covered stairwell leading up onto the wall.\nAunt Navani waved from up above, then gestured urgently.

These didn’t make him feel quite so melancholy.\nThey’d been minutes from reaching Aunt Navani.\nNavani hugged him. “Elhokar?” she asked, tense.\nAdolin shook his head. “I’m sorry.”\nShe pulled him tight, and he dismissed his Blade, holding her as she\nshook, letting out quiet tears. Storms … he knew how that felt. He hadn’t\nreally been able to take time to think since Elhokar’s death. He’d felt the\noppressive hand of responsibility, but had he grieved for his cousin?\nHe pulled his aunt tighter, feeling her pain, mirror to his own. The stone\nmonster crashed through the city, and soldiers shouted from all around—but\nin that moment, Adolin did what he could to comfort a mother who had lost\nher son.\nFinally they broke, Navani drying her eyes with a handkerchief. She\ngasped as she saw his bloodied side.\n“I’m fine,” he explained. “Renarin healed me.”\n“I saw your betrothed and the bridgeman down below,” Navani said. “So\neveryone … everyone but him?”\n“I’m sorry, Aunt. I just … We failed him. Elhokar and Kholinar both.”\nShe blotted her eyes and stiffened with determination. “Come. Our focus\nnow has to be on keeping this city from suffering the same fate.”\nThey joined Queen Fen, who was surveying the battle from atop the\nwall. “Estnatil was on the wall with us when that thing hit,” she was saying\nto her son. “He got thrown down and likely died, but there’s a Shardblade in\nthat rubble somewhere. I haven’t seen Tshadr. Perhaps at his manor? I\nwouldn’t be surprised to find him gathering troops at the upper tiers.”\nCounting Shardbearers. Thaylenah had three sets of Plate and five Blades\n—a solid number of Shards for a kingdom of this size. Eight houses passed\nthem down, father to son, each of whom served the throne as a highguard.\nAdolin glanced over the city, assessing the defense. Fighting in city\nstreets was difficult; your men got divided up, and were easily flanked or\nsurrounded. Fortunately, the Sadeas troops seemed to have forgotten their\nbattle training. They didn’t hold ground well; they had broken into roving\nbands, like axehound packs, loping through the city and looking for\ncontests.\n“You need to join your troops,” Adolin said to the Thaylens. “Block off a\nstreet below, coordinate a resistance. Then—”\nA sudden whooshing sound cut him off.\nHe stumbled back as the wall shook, then the broken gap in it mended.\nMetal grew like crystals to fill the hole, springing into existence out of a\ntempest of rushing, howling air.\nThe end result was a beautiful, brilliant section of polished bronze\nmelding with the stonework and completely sealing the gap.\n“Taln’s palms,” Fen said.

She and her consort stepped closer to the edge\nand looked down at Jasnah, who dusted off her hands, then rested them on\nher hips in a satisfied posture.\n“So … change of tactics,” Adolin said. “With the gap filled, you can get\narchers in position to harry the army outside and hold the inside square. Set\nup a command position here, clear the street below, and then hold this wall\nat all costs.”\nBelow, Jasnah strode away from the marvel she’d created, then knelt\nbeside some rubble and cocked her head, listening to something. She\npressed her hand against the rubble and it vanished into smoke, revealing a\ncorpse beneath—and a brilliant Shardblade beside it.\n“Kdralk,” Adolin said, “how are your Shardblade stances?”\n“I … I’ve practiced with them, like other officers, and—I mean—”\n“Great. Take ten soldiers, go get that Blade, then rescue that cluster of\ntroops over there at the base of the Ancient Ward. Next try to rescue that\nother group fighting on the steps. Station every archer you can up here on\nthe wall, and put the rest of the soldiers to work guarding the streets.”\nAdolin glanced over his shoulder. Shallan’s distraction was working well,\nfor now. “Don’t stretch too far, but as you rescue more men, make a\ncoordinated effort to hold the entire Low Ward.”\n“But Prince Adolin,” Fen said, “what will you be doing?”\nAdolin summoned his Blade and pointed with it toward the back of the\nAncient Ward, where the gigantic stone monstrosity swept a group of\nsoldiers from a rooftop. Others tried—in futility—to trip it with ropes.\n“Those men seem like they could use the help of a weapon designed\nspecifically to cut through stone.”\n* * *\nAmaram fought with striking fury—a frenetic kind of harmony, an\nunending assault of weaving Shardblades and beautiful stances. Kaladin\nblocked one Blade with the Sylspear, and they locked for a moment.\nA sharp violet crystal burst out of Amaram’s elbow, cracking the\nShardplate there, glowing with a soft inner light. Storms! Kaladin flung\nhimself backward as Amaram swung his other Blade, nearly connecting.\nKaladin danced away. His training with the sword had been short, and\nhe’d never seen anyone use two Blades at once. He would have considered\nit unwieldy. Amaram made it look elegant, mesmerizing.\nThat deep red glow within Amaram’s helm grew darker, bloody,\nsomehow even more sinister. Kaladin blocked another hit, but the power of\nthe blow sent him skidding backward on the stone. He’d made himself\nlighter for the fight, but that had repercussions when facing someone in\nPlate.\nPuffing, Kaladin launched himself into the air to get some distance. That\nPlate prevented him from using Lashings against Amaram, and it blocked\nhits from the Sylspear. Yet, if Amaram landed a single strike, that would\nimmobilize Kaladin. Healing the wound from a Shardblade was possible,\nbut was slow and left him horribly weakened."

Healing the wound from a Shardblade was possible,\nbut was slow and left him horribly weakened.\nThis was all complicated by the fact that, while Amaram could focus\nonly on their duel, Kaladin had to keep watching Dalinar in case—\nDamnation!\nKaladin Lashed himself to the side, streaking through the air to engage\none of the Fused who had started hovering near Dalinar. She struck toward\nKaladin—but that only let him change Syl to a Blade midswing, and cut her\nlong spear in half. She hummed an angry song and floated backward,\nsliding her sword from its sheath. Below, Dalinar was a mere shadow\nagainst the shifting crimson cloud. Faces emerged within, screaming with\nrage, fury, bloodlust—like the billowing front of a thunderhead.\nBeing near the mist made Kaladin feel nauseous. Fortunately, the enemy\ndidn’t seem eager to enter it either. They hovered outside, watching Dalinar.\nA few had ducked in closer, but Kaladin had managed to drive them back.\nHe pressed his advantage against his current foe, using Syl as a spear.\nThe Fused was nimble, but Kaladin was flush with Stormlight. The field\nbelow was still littered with a fortune in glowing spheres.\nAfter he got in close with a strike—cutting the Fused’s robes—she\nzipped away to join a group that was focusing on Szeth. Hopefully the\nassassin could stay ahead of them.\nNow, where had Amaram gotten to.… Kaladin glanced over his\nshoulder, then yelped and Lashed himself backward, Stormlight puffing\nbefore him. A thick black arrow shot right through that, dispersing the\nLight.\nAmaram stood near his horse, where he’d unhooked a massive\nShardbow that used arrows as thick as a spear’s haft. Amaram raised it to\nloose again, and a line of crystals jutted out along his arm, cracking his\nShardplate. Storms, what was happening to that man?\nKaladin zipped out of the way of the arrow. He could heal from a hit like\nthat, but it would distract him—potentially let some of the Fused seize him.\nAll the Stormlight in the world wouldn’t save him if they simply bound\nhim, then hacked at him until he stopped healing.\nAmaram launched another arrow, and Kaladin blocked it with Syl, who\nbecame a shield in his grip. Then, Kaladin Lashed himself into a dive,\nsummoning Syl as a lance. He swooped down on Amaram, who hooked his\nShardbow back onto the horse’s saddle and dodged to the side, moving with\nincredible speed.\nAmaram grabbed the Syllance as Kaladin dove past, flinging Kaladin to\nthe side. Kaladin was forced to dismiss Syl and slow himself, spinning and\nsliding across the ground until his Lashing ran out and he settled down.\nTeeth gritted, Kaladin summoned Syl as a short spear, then rushed\nAmaram—determined to bring the highlord down before the Fused returned\nto attack Dalinar.\n* * *\nThe Thrill was happy to see Dalinar.\nHe had imagined it as some evil force, malignant and insidious, like"

Ivory formed and\nsliced through the Fused’s head as it passed, sending it curling about itself\n—eyes burning—and tumbling along the wall top.\n“The enemy,” Jasnah said, “will not be stopped by a wall, and Brightness\nShallan has feasted upon almost all of the spheres Uncle Dalinar recharged.\nMy Stormlight is nearly gone. We have to be ready to hold this position\nthrough conventional means once the power is gone.”\n“Surely there aren’t enough enemy troops to…” Fen’s consort said, but\ntrailed off as Jasnah pointed with Ivory—who obligingly formed again—\ntoward the waiting parshman armies. Neither the hovering red haze nor the\nbreaking lightning of the storm was enough to drown out the red glows\nbeginning to appear in the parshmen’s eyes.\n“We must be ready to hold this wall as long as it takes for troops to\narrive from Urithiru,” Jasnah said. “Where is Renarin? Wasn’t he to deal\nwith that thunderclast?”\n“One of my soldiers reported seeing him,” Fen said. “He had been\nslowed by the crowds. Prince Adolin expressed an intention to go help.”\n“Excellent. I will trust that task to my cousins, and instead see what I can\ndo to keep my ward from getting herself killed.”\n* * *\nSzeth wove and dodged between the attacks of five enemy Fused, carrying\nthe large dun ruby in his left hand, the sheathed black sword in his right. He\ntried to approach Dalinar in the red mist, but the enemy cut him off, and he\nwas forced to turn east.\nHe skimmed the now-repaired wall and crossed over the city, eventually\nsoaring past the monster of stone. It flung several soldiers into the air, and\nfor a moment they soared with Szeth.\nSzeth Lashed himself downward, diving for the city streets. Behind him,\nFused broke around the monster and swarmed after. He shot through a\ndoorway and into a small home—and heard a thump above as a soldier’s\nbody fell onto the roof—then crashed out the back door and Lashed himself\nupward, narrowly avoiding the next building.\n“Was I supposed to save those soldiers, sword-nimi?” Szeth said. “I am a\nRadiant now.”\nI think they would have flown like you instead of falling down, if they’d\nwanted to be saved.\nThere was a profound puzzle in the words, one which Szeth could not\nconsider. The Fused were deft, more skilled than he was. He dodged among\nthe streets, but they kept on him. He swung around, left the Ancient Ward,\nand shot for the wall—trying to get back to Dalinar. Unfortunately, a swarm\nof the enemies cut him off. The rest surrounded him.\nLooks like we’re cornered, the sword said. Time to fight, right? Accept\ndeath, and die slaying as many as possible? I’m ready. Let’s do it. I’m ready\nto be a noble sacrifice."

He dropped\ntoward the ground, where spheres glistened like stars. He drew in a deep\nbreath of Stormlight, then spotted Lift waiting on the field between the\nfighting illusions and the waiting parshmen.\nSzeth settled down lightly beside her. “I have failed to carry this\nburden.”\n“That’s okay. Your weird face is burden enough for one man.”\n“Your words are wise,” he said, nodding.\nLift rolled her eyes. “You’re right, sword. He’s not very fun, is he?”\nI think he’s deevy anyway.\nSzeth did not know this word, but it sent Lift chortling in a fit of\namusement, which the sword mimicked.\n“We have not fulfilled the Blackthorn’s demands,” Szeth snapped at the\ntwo of them, Stormlight puffing from his lips. “I could not stay ahead of\nthose Fused long enough to deliver the stone to our master.”\n“Yeah, I saw,” Lift said. “But I’ve got an idea. People are always after\nstuff, but they don’t really like the stuff—they like having the stuff.”\n“These words are … not so wise. What do you mean?”\n“Simple. The best way to rob someone is leave them thinking that\nnothing is wrong.…”\n* * *\nShallan clung to Veil’s and Radiant’s hands.\nShe’d long since fallen to her knees, staring ahead as tears leaked from\nher eyes. Taut, her teeth gritted. She’d made thousands of illusions. Each\none … each one was her.\nA portion of her mind.\nA portion of her soul.\nOdium had made a mistake in flooding these soldiers with such thirst for\nblood. They didn’t care that Shallan fed them illusions—they just wanted a\nbattle. So she provided one, and somehow her illusions resisted when the\nenemy hit them. She thought maybe she was combining Soulcasting with\nher Lightweaving.\nThe enemy howled and sang, exulting in the fray. She painted the ground\nred and sprayed the enemy with blood that felt real. She serenaded them\nwith the sounds of men screaming, dying, swords clashing and bones\nbreaking.\nShe absorbed them in the false reality, and they drank it in; they feasted\non it.\nEach one of her illusions that died hit her with a little shock. A sliver of\nher dying.\nThose were reborn as she pushed them out to dance again. Enemy Fused\nbellowed for order, trying to rally their troops, but Shallan drowned out\ntheir voices with sounds of screaming and metal on metal.\nThe illusion absorbed her entirely, and she lost track of everything else.\nLike when she was drawing.

His spear\nhit right on target, where it would have dug into the armpit of an ordinary\nopponent. Here, unfortunately, the spear just slid off. Shardplate didn’t have\ntraditional weak points, other than the eye slit. You had to break it open\nwith repeated hits, like cracking into a crab’s shell.\nAmaram laughed, a startlingly genuine mirth. “You have great form,\nspearman! Do you remember when you first came to me? Back in that\nvillage, when you begged me to take you? You were a blubbering child who\nwanted so badly to be a soldier. The glory of the battle! I could see the lust\nin your eyes, boy.”\nKaladin glanced toward the Fused, who rounded the cloud, timid,\nlooking for Dalinar.\nAmaram chuckled. With those deep red eyes and the strange crystals\ngrowing from his body, Kaladin hadn’t expected him to sound so much like\nhimself. Whatever hybrid monster this was, it still had the mind of Meridas\nAmaram.\nKaladin stepped back, reluctantly changing Syl into a Blade, which\nwould be better for cracking Plate. He fell into Windstance, which had\nalways seemed appropriate. Amaram laughed again and surged forward, his\nsecond Shardblade appearing in his waiting grip. Kaladin dodged to the\nside, ducking under one Blade and getting at Amaram’s back—where he got\nin a good hit on the Plate, cracking it. He raised his Blade to attack again.\nAmaram slammed his foot down, and his Shardplate boot shattered,\nexploding outward in bits of molten metal. Beneath, his ripped sock\nrevealed a foot overgrown with carapace and deep violet crystals.\nAs Kaladin came in for his attack, Amaram tapped his foot, and the stone\nground became liquid for a moment. Kaladin stumbled, sinking down\nseveral inches, as if the rock were crem mud. It hardened in a moment,\nlocking Kaladin’s boots in place.\nKaladin! Syl cried in his mind as Amaram swung with two Shardblades,\nparallel to one another. Syl became a halberd in Kaladin’s hands, and he\nblocked the blows—but their force threw him to the ground, snapping his\nankles.\nTeeth gritted, Kaladin hauled his pained feet out of the boots and pulled\nhimself away. Amaram’s weapons sliced the ground behind, narrowly\nmissing him. Then Amaram’s other armored boot exploded, crystals from\ninside breaking it apart. The highlord pushed with one foot and glided\nacross the ground, incredibly quick, approaching Kaladin and swinging.\nSyl became a large shield, and Kaladin barely blocked the attack. He\nLashed himself backward, getting out of range as Stormlight healed his\nankles. Storms. Storms!"

He launched it into the air\nwith several Lashings compounded, which sent it zipping off to slam into\nthe head of the Fused. She shouted in pain, pulling back.\nKaladin scooped up another stone and Lashed it toward Amaram’s horse.\n“Beating up the animal because you can’t defeat me?” Amaram asked.\nHe didn’t seem to notice that the horse, in bolting away, carried off the\nShardbow.\nI’ve killed a man wearing that Shardplate before, Kaladin thought. I can\ndo it again.\nOnly, he wasn’t merely facing a Shardbearer. Amethyst crystals broke\nAmaram’s armor all up the arms. How did Kaladin defeat … whatever this\nthing was?\nStab it in the face? Syl suggested.\nIt was worth a try. He and Amaram fought on the battlefield near the red\nmist, on the western shore but between the main body of troops and the\nwaiting parshmen. The area was mostly flat, except for some broken\nbuilding foundations. Kaladin Lashed himself up a few inches, so he\nwouldn’t sink into the ground if Amaram tried again to do … whatever he’d\ndone. Then he moved backward carefully, positioning himself where\nAmaram would likely leap across a broken foundation to get at him.\nAmaram stepped up, chuckling softly. Kaladin raised Syl as a\nShardblade, but shifted his grip, preparing for the moment when she’d\nbecome a thin spear he could ram right through that faceplate—\nKaladin! Syl cried.\nSomething hit Kaladin with the force of a falling boulder, flinging him to\nthe side. His body broke, and the world spun.\nBy instinct, Kaladin Lashed himself upward and forward, opposite the\nway he’d been flung. He slowed and released the Lashings right as his\nmomentum ran out, touching down, then slid to a stop on the stone, pain\nfading from a healed shoulder and side.\nA brawny Fused—taller even than Amaram in his Plate—dropped a\nshattered club that he’d used on Kaladin. His carapace was the color of\nstone; he must have been crouching near that foundation, and Kaladin had\ntaken him for merely another part of the stony field.\nAs Kaladin watched, the creature’s brown carapace crusted up his arms,\ncovering his face like a helm, growing to thick armor in a matter of\nmoments. He raised his arms, and carapace spurs grew above and below the\nhands.\nDelightful.\n* * *\nAdolin heaved himself up over the rim of a broken rooftop onto a small\nalley between two buildings.

To his right, a main city thoroughfare led upward—toward\nthe Royal Ward and the Oathgate—but was clogged with people fleeing\nfrom the enemy troops below. This was compounded by the local merchant\nguards and platoons of Thaylen military, who struggled against the tide.\nMoving on the streets was extremely slow—but Adolin had found one\ncorridor that was empty. The thunderclast had crossed the Ancient Ward,\nkicking down buildings, then had stepped on roofs as it climbed up to the\nLoft Wards. This swath of destruction made almost a roadway. Adolin had\nmanaged to follow, using rubble like stairs.\nNow he was right in the thing’s shadow. The corpse of a Thaylen soldier\ndrooped from a rooftop nearby, tangled in ropes. It hung there, eyebrows\ndangling to brush the ground. Adolin swept past, peeking out between\nbuildings onto a larger street.\nA handful of Thaylens fought here, trying to bring the thunderclast\ndown. The ropes had been a great idea, but the thing was obviously too\nstrong to be tripped that way. In the street beyond Adolin, a soldier got in\nclose and tried to hit the monster’s leg with a hammer. The weapon bounced\noff. That was old hardened cremstone. The plucky soldier ended up getting\nstomped.\nAdolin gritted his teeth, summoning his Shardblade. Without Plate, he’d\nbe as squishy as anyone else. He had to be careful, tactical.\n“This is what you were designed for, isn’t it?” Adolin said softly as his\nBlade dropped into his hand. “It was for fighting things like that.\nShardblades are impractically long for duels, and Plate is overkill even on\nthe battlefield. But against a monster of stone…”\nHe felt something. A stirring on the wind.\n“You want to fight it, don’t you?” Adolin asked. “It reminds you of when\nyou were alive.”\nSomething tickled his mind, very faint, like a sigh. A single word:\nMayalaran. A … name?\n“Right, Maya,” Adolin said. “Let’s bring that thing down.”\nAdolin waited for it to turn toward the small group of defending soldiers,\nthen he bolted out along the rubbled street, dashing straight for the\nthunderclast. He was barely as tall as its calf.\nAdolin didn’t use any of the sword stances—he just hacked as if he were\nattacking a wall, slicing right along the top of the thing’s ankle.\nA sudden bang sounded above, like two stones slamming against one\nanother, as the thing cried out. A shock wave of air washed over Adolin and\nthe monster turned, thrusting a hand down toward him. Adolin dodged to\nthe side, but the monster’s palm smashed the ground with such force that\nAdolin’s boots left the ground momentarily. He dismissed Maya as he fell,\nthen rolled.\nHe came up puffing on one knee with his hand out, summoning Maya\nagain.

He’d heard the descriptions of these things from his father’s visions\n—but looking up at it, he was struck by the shape of its face and head.\nA chasmfiend, he thought. It looks like a chasmfiend. The head, at least.\nThe body was vaguely like a thick human skeleton.\n“Prince Adolin!” one of the few living soldiers shouted. “It’s the son of\nthe Blackthorn!”\n“Protect the prince! Distract the monster from the Shardbearer. It’s our\nonly chance to—”\nAdolin lost the last part as the monster swept its hand across the ground.\nHe barely dodged, then threw himself through the doorway of a low\nbuilding. Inside, he leaped over a few bedding pallets, pushed into the next\nroom, then attacked the brick wall with Maya, cutting in four quick strikes.\nHe slammed his shoulder against the wall, breaking through the hole.\nAs he did, he heard a whimper from behind.\nAdolin gritted his teeth. I could use one of those storming Radiants\nabout now.\nHe ducked back into the building and flipped over a table, finding a\nyoung boy huddled underneath. That was the only person Adolin saw in the\nbuilding. He hauled the boy out right as the thunderclast smashed a fist\ndown through the roof. Dust billowing after him, Adolin shoved the child\ninto the arms of a soldier, then pointed both toward the street to the south.\nAdolin took off running east, around the side of the building. Maybe he\ncould climb up to the next level of the Loft Wards and circle the creature.\nFor all the troops’ calls to distract the thing, however, it obviously knew\nwho to focus on. It stepped over the broken house and thrust a fist toward\nAdolin—who leaped through a window into another house, across a table,\nthen out an open window on the other side.\nCrash.\nThe building fell in behind him. The thing was doing damage to its own\nhands with the attacks, leaving the wrists and fingers scored with white\nscrapes. It didn’t seem to care—and why should it? It had ripped itself right\nfrom the ground to make this body.\nAdolin’s only advantage, other than his Blade, was his ability to react\nfaster than the thing. It swung for the next building beyond him, trying to\nsmash it before he got inside—but he was already doubling back. He ran\nunderneath the monster’s swing, sliding on the chips and dust as the fist\npassed narrowly overhead.\nThat put him in position to run between the thunderclast’s legs. He\nslashed at the ankle he’d already cut once, digging his Blade deep into the\nstone, then whipping it out the other side. Just like a chasmfiend, he\nthought. Legs first.\nWhen the thing stepped again, the ankle cracked with a sharp sound,\nthen its foot broke free.\nAdolin braced himself for the pained thunderclap from above, but still\nwinced at the shock wave. Unfortunately, the monster balanced easily on\nthe stump of its leg. It was a little clumsier than before, but it was in no real\ndanger of falling.

If he rejected it, he would drive the Thrill away.\n“Thank you,” Dalinar said, “for giving me strength when I needed it.”\nThe Thrill thrummed with a pleased sound. It drew in closer to him, the\nfaces of red mist grinning with excitement and glee. Charging horses\nscreamed and died. Men laughed as they were cut down.\nDalinar was once again walking on the stone toward the Rift, intent on\nmurdering everyone inside. He felt the heat of anger.

She left the humans to struggle\nagainst shadows in a mess of anger and lust. She walked deeper into the\ndarkness beneath Odium’s storm, feeling strangely sick.\nThe rhythms were going crazy inside her, merging and fighting. A\nfragment from Craving blended into Fury, into Ridicule.\nShe passed Fused arguing about what to do, now that Odium had\nwithdrawn. Did they send the parshmen in to fight? They couldn’t control\nthe humans, consumed by one of the Unmade as they were.\nRhythms piled over rhythms.\nAgony. Conceit. Destruction. Lost—\nThere! Venli thought. Grab that!\nShe attuned the Rhythm of the Lost. She clung to the solemn beat,\ndesperate—a rhythm one attuned to remember those you missed. Those\nwho had gone before.\nTimbre thrummed to the same rhythm. Why did that feel different from\nbefore? Timbre vibrated through Venli’s entire being.\nLost. What had Venli lost?\nVenli missed being someone who cared about something other than\npower. Knowledge, favoritism, forms, wealth—it was all the same to her.\nWhere had she gone wrong?\nTimbre pulsed. Venli dropped to her knees. Cold stone reflected lightning\nfrom above, red and garish.\nBut her own eyes … she could see her own eyes in the polished wet\nrock.\nThere wasn’t a hint of red in them.\n“Life…” she whispered.\nThe king of the Alethi had reached out toward her. Dalinar Kholin, the\nman whose brother they’d killed.

Venli rushed toward the ship’s\ncabin.

The helm had stylized eyebrows like knives\nsweeping backward, and the Plate was skirted with a triangular pattern of\ninterlocking scales. Cvaderln, he thought, remembering his lists of Thaylen\nShards. It meant, roughly, “shell of Cva.”\n“Are you Tshadr?” Adolin guessed.\n“No, Hrdalm,” the Shardbearer said in a thick Thaylen accent. “Tshadr\nholds Court Square. I come, stop monster.”\nAdolin nodded. Outside, the thing sounded its angry call, confronting the\nremaining Thaylen troops.\n“We need to get out and help those men,” Adolin said. “Can you distract\nthe monster?

But, once the thunderclast had rubbed its hand to the side,\nAdolin grabbed the cliff edge with one hand and swept Maya out to the\nside, freeing her from the stone. He reached down and rammed her into the\nstone below, then let go and swung from this new handhold a moment\nbefore releasing the Blade and dropping the rest of the way to the rooftop.\nHis leg screamed in pain. He collapsed to the rooftop, eyes watering. As\nhe lay there in agony, he felt something—a faint panic on the wind. He\nforced himself to roll to the side, and a Fused swept past, its lance barely\nmissing him.\nNeed … a weapon …\nHe started counting again and climbed, shakily, to his knees. But the\nthunderclast loomed on the tier overhead, then rammed its stump leg down\ninto the center of the stone roof Adolin was on.\nAdolin fell in a jumble of broken stone and dust, then hit hard on the\nfloor inside, chunks of rock clattering around him.\nEverything went black. He tried to gasp, but his muscles couldn’t make\nthe motions. He could only lie there, straining, groaning softly. A part of\nhim was aware of the sounds made as the thunderclast pulled its stump out\nof the broken home. He waited for it to smash him, but as his vision slowly\nreturned, he saw it stepping down from that upper tier onto the street\noutside.\nAt least … at least it wasn’t continuing on toward the Oathgate.\nAdolin shifted.

He crawled out onto the street, half expecting Skar and Drehy to be\nthere to pull him to his feet. Storms, he missed those bridgemen.\nThe street was empty around him, though maybe twenty feet away\npeople crowded, trying to get up the thoroughfare to safety. They called and\nshouted in fear and urgency. If Adolin ran that way, the thunderclast would\nfollow. It had proven determined to bring him down.\nHe sneered at the looming monster and—leaning against the wall of the\nsmall home he’d fallen into—pulled himself to his feet. Maya dropped into\nhis hand. Though he was covered in dust, she still shone bright.\nHe steadied himself, then held Maya in two hands—his grip wetted by\nblood—and fell into Stonestance. The immovable stance.\n“Come and get me, you bastard,” he whispered.\n“Adolin?” a familiar voice called from behind. “Storms, Adolin! What\nare you doing!”\nAdolin started, then glanced over his shoulder. A glowing figure pushed\nthrough the crowd onto his street. Renarin carried a Shardblade, and his\nblue Bridge Four uniform was unstained.\nTook you long enough.\nAs Renarin approached, the thunderclast actually took a step back, as if\nafraid. Well, that might help. Adolin clenched his teeth, trying to hold in his\nagony. He wobbled, then steadied himself. “All right, let’s—”\n“Adolin, don’t be foolhardy!” Renarin grabbed his arm. A burst of\nhealing moved through Adolin like cold water in his veins, causing his\npains to retreat.\n“But—”\n“Get away,” Renarin said. “You’re unarmored. You’ll get yourself killed\nfighting this thing!”\n“But—”\n“I can handle it, Adolin. Just go! Please.”\nAdolin stumbled back. He’d never heard such forceful talk from Renarin\n—that was almost more amazing than the monster. Renarin, shockingly,\ncharged at the thing.\nA clatter announced Hrdalm climbing down from above, his Plate’s helm\ncracked, but otherwise in good shape. He had lost his hammer, but carried\none of the lances from the Fused, and his Plate fist was covered in blood.\nRenarin! He didn’t have Plate. How—\nThe thunderclast’s palm crashed down on Renarin, smashing him.\nAdolin screamed, but his brother’s Shardblade cut up through the palm,\nthen separated the hand from the wrist.\nThe thunderclast trumpeted in anger as Renarin climbed from the rubble\nof the hand. He seemed to heal more quickly than Kaladin or Shallan did, as\nif being crushed wasn’t even a bother."

Okay?”\nAdolin nodded, stifling a groan of pain. Renarin’s healing had stopped\nhis insides from aching, and it was no longer painful to put weight on his\nleg, but his arms still ached, and some of his cuts hadn’t closed.\nAs Hrdalm stepped toward the fight, Adolin took the man by the arm,\nthen lifted Maya.\nGo with him for now, Maya, Adolin thought.\nHe almost wished she’d object, but the vague sensation he received was\na resigned agreement.\nHrdalm dropped his lance and took the Blade reverently. “Great Honor\nin you, Prince Adolin,” he said. “Great Passion in me at this aid.”\n“Go,” Adolin said. “I’ll go see if I can help hold the streets.”\nHrdalm charged off. Adolin chose an infantry spear from the rubble, then\nmade toward the roadway behind.\n* * *\nSzeth of the Skybreakers had, fortunately, trained with all ten Surges.\nThe Fused transferred the enormous ruby to one of their number who\ncould manipulate Abrasion—a woman who slid across the ground like Lift\ndid. She infused the ruby, making it glow with her version of a Lashing.\nThat would make the thing impossibly slick and difficult to carry for anyone\nbut the Fused woman herself.\nShe seemed to think her enemies would have no experience with such a\nthing. Unfortunately for them, Szeth had not only carried an Honorblade\nthat granted this power, he had practiced with skates on ice, a training\nexercise that somewhat mimicked an Edgedancer’s movements.\nAnd so, as he chased down the gemstone, he gave the Fused woman\nplenty of opportunities to underestimate him. He let her dodge, and was\nslow to reorient, acting surprised when she slipped this way, then that.\nOnce the Fused was confident she controlled this race, Szeth struck.\nWhen she leaped off a ledge of stone—soaring a short time in the air—\nSzeth swooped in with a sudden set of Lashings. He collided with her right\nas she landed. As his face touched her carapace, he Lashed her upward.\nThat sent her flying into the air with a scream. Szeth landed and prepared\nto follow, then cursed as the Fused fumbled with the gemstone. He whipped\nhis jacket off as she dropped it. Though one of the flying Fused swept in to\ngrab it, the ruby slipped out of his fingers.\nSzeth caught it in the jacket, held like a pouch. A lucky turn; he had\nassumed he would need to attack her again to get it out of her hands.\nNow, the real test. He Lashed himself eastward, toward the city.

Soon\nthe enemy would be able to ignore this distraction, regroup, and focus on\ngetting through that wall.\nDo what Dalinar told you. Get him this gemstone.\nThe ruby had finally stopped glowing, making it no longer slick. Above,\nmany Fused swooped to intercept Szeth; they seemed happy to play this\ngame, for as long as the gemstone was changing hands, it was not being\ndelivered to Dalinar.\nAs the first Fused came for him, Szeth ducked into a roll and canceled\nhis Lashing upward. He collided with a rock, acting dazed. He then shook\nhis head, took up his pouch with the ruby, and launched into the air again.\nEight Fused gave chase, and though Szeth dodged between them, one\neventually got close enough to seize his pouch and rip it out of his fingers.\nThey swept away as a flock, and Szeth slowly floated down and landed\nbeside Lift, who stepped out of the illusory rock. She held a bundle\nwrapped in clothing: the real gemstone, which she’d taken from his pouch\nduring his feigned collision. The Fused now had a false ruby—a rock cut\ninto roughly the same shape with a Shardblade, then covered in an illusion.\n“Come,” Szeth said, grabbing the girl and Lashing her upward, then\ntowing her after him as he swept toward the northern edge of the plain. This\nplace nearest the red mist had fallen into darkness—the Windrunner had\nconsumed all of the Stormlight in gemstones on the ground. He fought\nagainst several enemies nearby.\nShadowed darkness. Whispered words. Szeth slowed to a halt.\n“What?” Lift asked. “Crazyface?”\n“I…” Szeth trembled, fearspren bubbling from the ground below. “I\ncannot go into that mist. I must be away from this place.”\nThe whispers.\n“I got it,” she said. “Go back and help the redhead.”\nHe dropped Lift to the ground and backed away.

The creature\nbacked up, growling a soft but angry rhythm.\nAmaram’s screaming voice approached.

The eyes still glowed deeply\nwithin, and the stone ground somehow burned beneath his crystal-covered\nfeet, leaving flaming tracks behind.\nThe highprince battered against the Sylshield with two Shardblades. She,\nin turn, grew a latticework on the outside—with parts sticking out like the\ntines of a trident.\n“What are you doing?” Kaladin asked.\nImprovising.\nAmaram struck again, and Helaran’s sword got tangled in the tines.\nKaladin spun the shield, wrenching the sword out of Amaram’s grip. It\nvanished to smoke.\nNow, press the advantage.\nKaladin!\nThe hulking Fused charged him. The creature’s cut arms had regrown,\nand—even as it swung its hands—a large club formed there from carapace.\nKaladin barely got Syl in place to block.\nIt didn’t do much good.\nThe force of the club’s sideways blow flung Kaladin against the\nremnants of a wall. He growled, then Lashed himself upward into the sky,\nStormlight reknitting him. Damnation. The area around where they were\nfighting had grown dark and shadowed, the gemstones drained. Had he\nreally used so much?\nUh-oh, Syl said, flying around him as a ribbon of light. Dalinar!\nThe red mist billowed, ominous in the gloom. Red on black. Within it\nDalinar was a shadow, with two flying Fused besetting him.\nKaladin growled again. Amaram had gone hiking for his bow, which had\nfallen from the horse’s saddle some ways off. Damnation. He couldn’t\ndefeat them all.\nHe shot down toward the ground. The hulking Fused came for him, and\ninstead of dodging, Kaladin let the creature ram a knifelike spur into his\nstomach.\nHe grunted, tasting blood, but didn’t flinch. He grabbed the creature’s\nhand and Lashed him upward and toward the mist. The Fused flipped past\nhis companions in the air, shouting something that sounded like a plea for\nhelp. They zipped after him.\nKaladin stumbled after Amaram, but his footsteps steadied as he healed.\nHe got a little more Stormlight from some gemstones he’d missed earlier,\nthen took to the sky. Syl became a lance, and Kaladin swooped down,\ncausing Amaram to turn away from the bow—still a short distance from\nhim—and track Kaladin. Crystals had broken through his armor all along\nhis arms and back.\nKaladin made a charging pass. He wasn’t accustomed to flying with a\nlance though, and Amaram batted the Syllance aside with a Shardblade.\nKaladin rose up on the other side, considering his next move.\nAmaram launched himself into the air.\nHe soared in an incredible leap, far higher and farther than even\nShardplate would have allowed. And he hung for a time, sweeping close to\nKaladin, who dodged backward.\n“Syl,” he hissed as Amaram landed. “Syl, that was a Lashing. What is\nhe?”"

Amaram\nspun on him, eyes within the helm trailing red light. “Can you feel it?” he\ndemanded of Kaladin. “The beauty of the fight?”\nKaladin ducked in and rammed Syl at Amaram’s cracked breastplate.\n“It could have been so glorious,” Amaram said, swatting aside the attack.\n“You, me, Dalinar. Together on the same side.”\n“The wrong side.”\n“Is it wrong to want to help the ones who truly own this land? Is it not\nhonorable?”\n“It’s not Amaram I speak to anymore, is it? Who, or what, are you?”\n“Oh, it’s me,” Amaram said. He dismissed one of his Blades, grabbed his\nhelm. With a tug of the hand, it finally shattered, exploding away and\nrevealing the face of Meridas Amaram—surrounded by amethyst crystals,\nglowing with a soft and somehow dark light.\nHe grinned. “Odium promised me something grand, and that promise has\nbeen kept. With honor.”\n“You still pretend to speak of honor?”\n“Everything I do is for honor.” Amaram swept with a single Blade,\nmaking Kaladin dodge. “It was honor that drove me to seek the return of the\nHeralds, of powers, and of our god.”\n“So you could join the other side?”\nLightning flashed behind Amaram, casting red light and long shadows as\nhe resummoned his second Blade. “Odium showed me what the Heralds\nhave become. We spent years trying to get them to return. But they were\nhere all along. They abandoned us, spearman.”\nAmaram carefully circled Kaladin with his two Shardblades.\nHe’s waiting for the Fused to come help, Kaladin thought. That’s why\nhe’s being cautious now.\n“I hurt, once,” Amaram said. “Did you know that? After I was forced to\nkill your squad, I … hurt. Until I realized. It wasn’t my fault.” The color of\nhis glowing eyes intensified to a simmering crimson. “None of this is my\nfault.”\nKaladin attacked—unfortunately, he barely knew what he was facing.\nThe ground rippled and became liquid, almost catching him again. Fire\ntrailed behind Amaram’s arms as he swung with both Shardblades.\nSomehow, he briefly ignited the very air.\nKaladin blocked one Blade, then the other, but couldn’t get in an attack.\nAmaram was fast and brutal, and Kaladin didn’t dare touch the ground, lest\nhis feet freeze to the liquefied stone. After a few more exchanges, Kaladin\nwas forced to retreat.\n“You’re outclassed, spearman,” Amaram said. “Give in, and convince\nthe city to surrender. That is for the best. No more need die today. Let me be\nmerciful.”\n“Like you were merciful to my friends? Like you were merciful to me,\nwhen you gave me these brands?”\n“I left you alive. I spared you.”"

This, the person\nyou’ve become, was my gift!”\n“A gift at the expense of everyone I loved?”\n“What do you care? It made you strong!

Anyone would\nhave done what I did, even Dalinar himself.”\n“Didn’t you tell me you’d given up that grief?”\n“Yes!

He’ll never give it to you.”\nAmaram roared, sweeping in with his Shardblades. Kaladin Lashed\nhimself upward, then—as Amaram passed underneath—twisted and came\nback down, swinging in a powerful, two-handed grip. In response to an\nunspoken command, Syl became a hammer, which crashed against the back\nof Amaram’s Plate.\nThe cuirass-style breastplate—which was all one piece—exploded with\nan unexpected force, pushing Kaladin backward across the stone. Overhead,\nthe lightning rumbled. They were fully in the Everstorm’s shadow, which\nmade it even more ghastly as he saw what had happened to Amaram.\nThe highprince’s entire chest had collapsed inward. There was no sign of\nribs or internal organs. Instead, a large violet crystal pulsed inside his chest\ncavity, overgrown with dark veins. If he’d been wearing a uniform or\npadding beneath the armor, it had been consumed.\nHe turned toward Kaladin, heart and lungs replaced by a gemstone that\nglowed with Odium’s dark light.\n“Everything I’ve done,” Amaram said, blinking red eyes, “I’ve done for\nAlethkar. I’m a patriot!”\n“If that is true,” Kaladin whispered, “why do you still hurt?”\nAmaram screamed, charging him.\nKaladin raised Syl, who became a Shardblade. “Today, what I do, I do\nfor the men you killed. I am the man I’ve become because of them.”\n“I made you! I forged you!” He leaped at Kaladin, propelling himself off\nthe ground, hanging in the air.\nAnd in so doing, he entered Kaladin’s domain.\nKaladin launched at Amaram. The highprince swung, but the winds\nthemselves curled around Kaladin, and he anticipated the attack. He Lashed\nhimself to the side, narrowly avoiding one Blade. Windspren streaked past\nhim as he dodged the other by a hair’s width.\nSyl became a spear in his grip, matching his motions perfectly.

It blew free as she stepped between the enemy\nand Shallan, Radiant, and Veil. The ground turned glossy, the surface of the\nstone Soulcast into oil. Veil, Shallan, and Radiant were able to glimpse it in\nthe Cognitive Realm. It changed so easily. How did Jasnah manage that?\nJasnah Soulcast a spark from the air, igniting the oil and casting up a\nfield of flames. The Fused raised hands before their faces, stumbling back.\n“That should buy us a few moments.” Jasnah turned toward Radiant,\nVeil, and Shallan. She took Shallan by the arm—but Shallan wavered, then\npuffed away. Jasnah froze, then turned to Veil.\n“Here,” Radiant said, tired, stumbling to her feet. She was the one Jasnah\ncould feel. She blinked away tears. “Are you … real?”\n“Yes, Shallan.

Keep walking.”\nShe sliced the steps off as they walked. “Remember, you mustn’t order\nstones, as they are more stubborn than men. Use coercion. Speak of\nfreedom and of movement.

Most of the buildings here were a single story, so he used Glys\nto cut a hole in the roof. He then hollowed out some handholds in the rock\nwall and climbed up on top.\nBeyond, he was able to get onto the street leading to the Oathgate\nplatform. He was … unaccustomed to being able to do things like this. Not\nonly using the Shardblade, but being physical. He’d always been afraid of\nhis fits, always worried that a moment of strength would instantly become a\nmoment of invalidity.\nLiving like that, you learned to stay back. Just in case. He hadn’t\nsuffered a fit in a while. He didn’t know if that was just a coincidence—they\ncould be irregular—or if they had been healed, like his bad eyesight.\nIndeed, he still saw the world differently from everyone else. He was still\nnervous talking to people, and didn’t like being touched. Everyone else saw\nin each other things he never could understand. So much noise and\ndestruction and people talking and cries for help and sniffles and muttering\nand whispering all like buzzing, buzzings.\nAt least here, on this street near the Oathgate, the crowds had\ndiminished. Why was that? Wouldn’t they have pressed up here, hoping for\nescape? Why …\nOh.\nA dozen Fused hovered in the sky above the Oathgate, lances held\nformally before themselves, clothing draping beneath them and fluttering.\nTwelve. Twelve.\nThis, Glys said, would be bad.\nMotion caught his attention: a young girl standing in a doorway and\nwaving at him. He walked over, worried the Fused would attack him.\nHopefully his Stormlight—which he’d mostly used up fighting the\nthunderclast—wasn’t bright enough to draw their ire.\nHe entered the building, another single-story structure with a large open\nroom at the front. It was occupied by dozens of scribes and ardents, many of\nwhom huddled around a spanreed. Children that he couldn’t see crowded\nthe back rooms, but he could hear their whimpers. And he heard the\nscratching, scratching, scratching of reeds on paper.\n“Oh, bless the Almighty,” Brightness Teshav said, appearing from the\nmass of people. She pulled Renarin deeper into the room. “Have you any\nnews?”\n“My father sent me up here to help,” Renarin said. “Brightness, where\nare General Khal and your son?”\n“In Urithiru,” she said. “They transferred back to gather forces, but\nthen … Brightlord, there’s been an attack at Urithiru. We’ve been trying to\nget information via spanreed. It appears that a strike force of some kind\narrived at the advent of the Everstorm.”\n“Brightness!” Kadash called. “Spanreed to Sebarial’s scribes is\nresponding again. They apologize for the long delay. Sebarial pulled back,\nfollowing Aladar’s command, to the upper levels. He confirms that the\nattackers are parshmen.”\n“The Oathgates?” Renarin asked, hopeful. “Can they reach those, and\nopen the way here?”"

He confirms that the\nattackers are parshmen.”\n“The Oathgates?” Renarin asked, hopeful. “Can they reach those, and\nopen the way here?”\n“Not likely. The enemy is holding the plateau.”\n“Our armies have the advantage at Urithiru, Prince Renarin,” Teshav\nsaid. “Reports agree that the enemy strike force isn’t nearly large enough to\ndefeat us there. This is obviously a delaying tactic to keep us from\nactivating the Oathgate and bringing help to Thaylen City.”\nKadash nodded. “Those Fused above the Oathgate held even when the\nstone monster outside was falling. They know their orders—keep that\ndevice from being activated.”\n“Radiant Malata is the only way for our armies to reach us through the\nOathgate,” Teshav said. “But we can’t contact her, or any of the Kharbranth\ncontingent. The enemy struck them first. They knew exactly what they had\nto do to cripple us.”\nRenarin took a deep breath, drawing in Stormlight that Teshav was\ncarrying. His glow lit the room, and eyes all through the chamber looked up\nfrom spanreeds, turning toward him.\n“The portal has to be opened,” Renarin said.\n“Your Highness…” Teshav said. “You can’t fight them all.”\n“There’s nobody else.” He turned to go.\nShockingly, nobody called for him to stop.\nAll his life they’d done that. No, Renarin. That’s not for you. You can’t\ndo that. You’re not well, Renarin. Be reasonable, Renarin.\nHe’d always been reasonable. He’d always listened. It felt wonderful and\nterrifying at once to know that nobody did that today. The spanreeds\ncontinued their scratching, moving on their own, oblivious to the moment.\nRenarin stepped outside.\nTerrified, he strode down the street, summoning Glys as a Shardblade.\nAs he approached the ramp up to the Oathgate, the Fused descended. Four\nlanded on the ramp before him, then gave him a gesture not unlike a salute,\nhumming to a frantic tune he did not know.\nRenarin was so frightened, he worried he’d wet himself. Not very noble\nor brave, now was he?\nAh … what will come now? Glys said, voice thrumming through\nRenarin. What emerges?\nOne of his fits struck him.\nNot the old fits, where he grew weak. He had new ones now, that neither\nhe nor Glys could control. To his eyes, glass grew across the ground. It\nspread out like crystals, forming lattices, images, meanings and pathways.\nStained-glass pictures, panel after panel.\nThese had always been right. Until today—until they had proclaimed\nthat Jasnah Kholin’s love would fail.\nHe read this latest set of stained-glass images, then felt his fear drain\naway. He smiled. This seemed to confuse the Fused as they lowered their\nsalutes.\n“You’re wondering why I’m smiling,” Renarin said.\nThey didn’t respond.\n“Don’t worry,” Renarin said. “You didn’t miss something funny. I …\nwell, I doubt you’ll find it amusing.”"

A luminous wall expanded from\nthe Oathgate platform in a ring, trailing a glowing afterimage.\nIt faded to reveal an entire division of Alethi troops in Kholin blue\nstanding upon the Oathgate platform.\nThen, like a Herald from lore, a man rose into the air above them.\nGlowing white with Stormlight, the bearded man carried a long silver\nShardspear with a strange crossguard shape behind the tip.\nTeft.\nKnight Radiant.\n* * *\nShallan sat with her back against the battlement, listening to soldiers shout\norders. Navani had given her Stormlight and water, but was currently\ndistracted by reports from Urithiru.\nPattern hummed from the side of Veil’s jacket. “Shallan? You did well,\nShallan. Very well.”\n“An honorable stand,” Radiant agreed. “One against many, and we held\nour ground.”\n“Longer than we should have,” Veil said. “We were already exhausted.”\n“We’re still ignoring too much,” Shallan said. “We’re getting too good at\npretending.” She had decided to stay with Jasnah in the first place to learn.\nBut when the woman returned from the dead, Shallan had—instead of\naccepting training—immediately fled. What had she been thinking?\nNothing. She’d been trying to hide away things she didn’t want to face.\nLike always.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said, a concerned hum.\n“I’m tired,” Shallan whispered. “You don’t have to worry. After I rest,\nI’ll recover and settle down to being just one. I actually … actually don’t\nthink I’m quite as lost as I was before.”\nJasnah, Navani, and Queen Fen whispered together farther along the\nwall. Thaylen generals joined them, and fearspren gathered around. The\ndefense, in their opinion, was going poorly. Reluctantly, Veil pushed herself\nto her feet and surveyed the battlefield. Amaram’s forces were gathering\nbeyond bow range.\n“We delayed the enemy,” Radiant said, “but didn’t defeat them. We still\nhave an overwhelming army to face.…”\n“Mmmm…” Pattern said, high pitched, worried. “Shallan, look.\nBeyond.”\nOut nearer the bay, thousands upon thousands of fresh parshman troops\nhad begun to carry ladders off their ships to use in a full-on assault.\n* * *\n“Tell the men not to give chase to those Fused,” Renarin said to Lopen. “We\nneed to hold the Oathgate, first and foremost.”\n“Good enough, sure,” Lopen said, launching into the sky and going to\nrelay the order to Teft.\nThe Fused clashed with Bridge Four in the air over the city.

They were progressively\nmoving the clash farther out over the city, and Renarin worried they were\ndeliberately drawing Bridge Four away from the Oathgate.\nThe Alethi division marched into the city with shouts of praise and joy\nfrom the surrounding people. Two thousand men wasn’t going to do much if\nthose parshmen outside joined the battle, but it was a start—plus, General\nKhal had brought not one, but three Shardbearers. Renarin did his best to\nexplain the city situation, but was embarrassed to tell the Khals that he\ndidn’t know his father’s status.\nAs they reunited with Teshav—turning her scribe station into a command\npost—Rock and Lyn landed next to Renarin.\n“Ha!” Rock said. “What happened to uniform? Is needing my needle.”\nRenarin looked down at his tattered clothing. “I got hit by a large block\nof stone. Twenty times … You’re not one to complain, anyway. Is that your\nblood on your uniform?”\n“Is nothing!”\n“We had to carry him all the way down to the Oathgate,” Lyn said. “We\nwere trying to get him to you, but he started drawing in Stormlight as soon\nas he got here.”\n“Kaladin is close,” Rock agreed. “Ha! I feed him. But here, today, he fed\nme. With light!”\nLyn eyed Rock. “Storming Horneater weighs as much as a chull.…” She\nshook her head. “Kara will fight with the others—don’t tell anyone, but\nshe’s been practicing with a spear since childhood, the little cheater. But\nRock won’t fight, and I’ve only been handling a spear for a few weeks now.\nAny idea where you want us?”\n“I’m … um … not really in command or anything.…”\n“Really?” Lyn said. “That’s your best Knight Radiant voice?”\n“Ha!” Rock said.\n“I think I used up all my Radianting for the day,” Renarin said. “Um, I’ll\nwork the Oathgate and get more troops here. Maybe you two could go down\nand help on the city wall, pull wounded out of the front lines?”\n“Is good idea,” Rock said. Lyn nodded and flew off, but Rock lingered,\nthen grabbed Renarin in a very warm, suffocating, and unexpected embrace.\nRenarin did his best not to squirm. It wasn’t the first hug he’d endured\nfrom Rock. But … storms. You weren’t supposed to just grab someone like\nthat.\n“Why?” Renarin said after the embrace.\n“You looked like person who needed hug.”\n“I assure you, I never look like that. But, um, I am glad you guys came.\nReally, really glad.”\n“Bridge Four,” Rock said, then launched into the air.\nRenarin settled down nearby on some steps, trembling from it all, but\ngrinning anyway.\n* * *\nDalinar drifted in the Thrill’s embrace.\nHe’d once believed he had been four men in his life, but he now saw\nhe’d grossly underestimated.

The Thrill threatened to take him, control him, rip him apart and\nshred his soul in its eagerness to please him—to give him something it\ncould never understand was dangerous.\nA small hand gripped Dalinar’s.\nHe started, looking down. “L-Lift?

He accepted what he had done. It would always be\npart of him. And though he was determined to resist, he would not cast\naside what he had learned. That very thirst for the struggle—the fight, the\nvictory—had also prepared him to refuse Odium.\n“Thank you,” he whispered again to the Thrill, “for giving me strength\nwhen I needed it.”\nThe Thrill churned close around him, cooing and exulting in his praise.\n“Now, old friend, it is time to rest.”\n* * *\nKeep moving.\nKaladin dodged and wove, avoiding some strikes, healing from others.\nKeep them distracted.\nHe tried to take to the skies, but the eight Fused swarmed about him,\nknocking him back down.

You simply have to last long enough.\nHe dodged to the right, skimming a few inches above the ground. But\none of the hulking Fused—there were four fighting him now—grabbed him\nby the foot.

Those could heal unless you stabbed\nthem in exactly the right spot in the sternum, and he’d missed. So, he made\nSyl into a sword and—the weapon still embedded in the Fused woman’s\nchest—swept upward through the head, burning her eyes. Another hulking\nFused swung, but as it hit—the club being part of the thing’s actual body—\nKaladin used much of his remaining Stormlight to Lash this man upward,\ncrashing him into a Fused above.\nAnother clobbered him from the side, sending him rolling. Red lightning\npulsed overhead as he came to a rest on his back. He immediately\nsummoned Syl as a spear, pointing straight up. That impaled the Fused\ndropping down to attack him, cracking its sternum within, causing its eyes\nto burn.\nAnother grabbed him by the foot and lifted him, then slammed him face-\nfirst into the ground.

The Fused stumbled backward, muttering to\na quick, worried rhythm. Then, remarkably, it turned and ran.\nKaladin twisted, looking behind himself.

So tall and brave. Seemingly perfect.\n“I saw it in your eyes, Amaram,” Kaladin whispered as the husk of a\nman stumbled up to him. “When you killed Coreb and Hab and my other\nfriends.

He will return it, human, when you need\nit.”\nThat would be fine, so long as he could forget the look of betrayal he’d\nseen in Kaladin’s eyes.\n“Hnanan wishes to speak with you,” the ancient one said. The name\nwasn’t fully a word. It was more a hummed sound, with specific beats.\n“Join us above.”\nShe flew off. Moash set aside his pick and followed in a more mundane\nmanner, rounding to the front of the palace. Once away from the picks and\nthe clatter of rocks, he could hear sobs and whimpers.

He eventually found\nHnanan out beyond the king’s balcony, hovering in the air, her train\nblowing and rippling in the wind beneath.\n“Ancient Singer,” he said from the balcony.

He’d survive a\nforceful hug.\nKaladin and Lopen hovered nearby. “He’s mine,” she said to them.\nThey nodded, and didn’t move.\n“People need your help inside,” she said. “I can handle him, boys.”\nFinally they flew off, and Navani tried to get under Dalinar’s arm. He\nshook his head, still holding her in the embrace, a large stone—wrapped in\nhis coat—held in one hand and pressing against her back. What was that?\n“I think I know why the memories came back,” he whispered. “Odium\nwas going to make me remember once I faced him. I needed to learn to\nstand up again. All my pain these last two months was a blessing.”\nShe held to him on that open field of rock, broken by the thunderclasts,\nlittered with men who wailed toward the empty sky, screaming for what\nthey’d done, demanding to know why they’d been abandoned.\nDalinar resisted Navani’s attempts to tug him toward the wall. Instead,\nteary eyed, he kissed her. “Thank you for inspiring me.”\n“Inspiring you?”\nHe released her and held up his arm, which was strapped with the clock\nand painrial she’d given him. It had cracked open, exposing the gemstones.\n“It reminded me,” he said. “Of how we make fabrials.”\nHe lethargically unwrapped his uniform jacket from around a large ruby.\nIt glowed with a bizarre light, deep and dark. Somehow, it seemed to be\ntrying to pull the light around it in.\n“I want you to keep this safe for me,” Dalinar said. “Study it. Find out\nwhy this gemstone specifically was capable of holding one of the Unmade.\nDon’t break it though. We dare not let it out again.”"

We dare not let it out again.”\nShe bit her lip. “Dalinar, I’ve seen something like this before. Much\nsmaller, like a sphere.” She looked up at him. “Gavilar made it.”\nDalinar touched the stone with his bare finger. Deep within it, something\nseemed to stir. Had he really trapped an entire Unmade inside this thing?\n“Study it,” he repeated. “And in the meantime, there’s something else I\nwant you to do, dearest. Something unconventional, perhaps\nuncomfortable.”\n“Anything,” she said. “What is it?”\nDalinar met her eyes. “I want you to teach me how to read.”\n* * *\nEveryone started celebrating. Shallan, Radiant, and Veil just settled down\non the wall walk, back to the stone.\nRadiant worried they’d leave the city undefended in their reverie. And\nwhat had become of the enemy that had been fighting in the streets? The\ndefenders had to make certain this wasn’t an elaborate feint.\nVeil worried about looting. A city in chaos often proved how feral it\ncould become. Veil wanted to be out on the streets, looking for people likely\nto be robbed, and making sure they were cared for.\nShallan wanted to sleep. She felt … weaker … more tired than the other\ntwo.\nJasnah approached along the wall walk, then leaned down beside her.\n“Shallan? Are you well?”\n“Just tired,” Veil lied. “You have no idea how draining that was,\nBrightness. I could use a stiff drink.”\n“I suspect that would help very little,” Jasnah said, rising. “Rest here a\nwhile yet. I want to make absolutely certain the enemy is not returning.”\n“I swear to do better, Brightness,” Radiant said, taking Jasnah’s hand. “I\nwish to fulfill my wardship—to study and learn until you determine I am\nready. I will not flee again. I’ve realized I have very far to go yet.”\n“That is well, Shallan.” Jasnah moved off.\nShallan. Which … which am I…? She’d insisted she would be better\nsoon, but that didn’t seem to be happening. She grasped for an answer,\nstaring into the nothingness until Navani approached and knelt down beside\nher. Behind, Dalinar accepted a respectful bow from Queen Fen, then\nbowed back.\n“Storms, Shallan,” Navani said. “You look like you can barely keep your\neyes open. I’ll get you a palanquin to the upper reaches of the city.”\n“The Oathgate is likely clogged,” Radiant said. “I would not take a place\nfrom others who might be in greater need.”\n“Don’t be foolish, child,” Navani said, then gave her an embrace. “You\nmust have been through so much. Devmrh, would you get a palanquin for\nBrightness Davar?”\n“My own feet are good enough,” Veil said, glaring at the scribe who\njumped to obey Navani. “I’m stronger than you think—no offense,\nBrightness.”\nNavani pursed her lips, but then was pulled away by Dalinar and Fen’s\nconversation; they were planning to write the Azish and explain what had"

Veil figured he was rightly worried that today’s events would\nspread as rumors of Alethi betrayal. Storms, if she hadn’t been here herself,\nshe’d have been tempted to believe them. It wasn’t every day that an entire\narmy went rogue.\nRadiant decided they could rest for ten minutes. Shallan accepted that,\nleaning her head back against the wall. Floating …\n“Shallan?”\nThat voice. She opened her eyes to find Adolin scrambling across the\nwall to her. He skidded a little as he fell to his knees beside her, then raised\nhis hands—only to hesitate, as if confronted by something very fragile.\n“Don’t look at me like that,” Veil said. “I’m not some delicate piece of\ncrystal.”\nAdolin narrowed his eyes.\n“Truly,” Radiant said. “I’m a soldier as much as the men atop this wall.\nTreat me—other than in obvious respects—as you would treat them.”\n“Shallan…” Adolin said, taking her hand.\n“What?” Veil asked.\n“Something’s wrong.”\n“Of course it is,” Radiant said. “This fighting has left us all thoroughly\nworn out.”\nAdolin searched her eyes. She bled from one, to the other, and back. A\nmoment of Veil. A moment of Radiant. Shallan peeking through—\nAdolin’s hand tightened around her own.\nShallan’s breath caught. There, she thought. That’s the one. That’s the\none I am.\nHe knows.\nAdolin relaxed, and for the first time she noticed how ragged his clothing\nwas. She raised her safehand to her lips. “Adolin, are you all right?”\n“Oh!” He looked down at his ripped uniform and scraped hands. “It’s not\nas bad as it looks, Shallan. Most of the blood isn’t mine. Well, I mean, I\nguess it is. But I’m feeling better.”\nShe cupped his face with her freehand. “You’d better not have gotten too\nmany scars. I’m expecting you to remain pretty, I’ll have you know.”\n“I’m barely hurt, Shallan. Renarin got to me.”\n“Then it’s all right if I do this?” Shallan asked, hugging him. He\nresponded, pulling her tight. He smelled of sweat and blood—not the\ngentlest of scents, but this was him and she was Shallan.\n“How are you?” he asked. “Really?”\n“Tired,” she whispered.\n“You want a palanquin…”\n“Everyone keeps asking that.”\n“I could carry you up,” he said, then pulled back and grinned. “Course,\nyou’re a Radiant. So maybe you could carry me instead? I’ve already been\nall the way up to the top of the city and back down once.…”\nShallan smiled, until farther down the wall a glowing figure in blue\nlanded on the battlements. Kaladin settled down, blue eyes shining, flanked\nby Rock and Lopen. Soldiers all along the walk turned toward him. Even in\na battle with multiple Knights Radiant, there was something about the way"

Even in\na battle with multiple Knights Radiant, there was something about the way\nKaladin flew, the way he moved.\nVeil immediately took over. She pulled herself to her feet as Kaladin\nstrode along the wall to meet with Dalinar. What happened to his boots?\n“Shallan?” Adolin asked.\n“A palanquin sounds great,” Veil said. “Thanks.”\nAdolin blushed, then nodded and strode toward one of the stairwells\ndown into the city.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “I’m confused.”\n“We need to approach this from a logical position,” Radiant said. “We’ve\nbeen dancing around a decision for months, ever since those days we spent\nin the chasms with Stormblessed. I’ve begun to consider that a relationship\nbetween two Knights Radiant is likely to accomplish a more equitable\nunion.”\n“Also,” Veil added, “look at those eyes. Simmering with barely bridled\nemotion.” She walked toward him, grinning.\nThen slowed.\nAdolin knows me.\nWhat was she doing?\nShe shoved Radiant and Veil aside, and when they resisted, she stuffed\nthem into the back part of her brain. They were not her. She was\noccasionally them. But they were not her.\nKaladin hesitated on the wall walk, but Shallan just gave him a wave,\nthen went the other way, tired—but determined.\n* * *\nVenli stood by the railing of a fleeing ship.\nThe Fused boasted from within the captain’s cabin. They talked about\nnext time, promising what they’d do and how they’d win. They spoke of\npast victories, and subtly hinted at why they’d failed. Too few of them had\nawakened so far, and those who had awakened were unaccustomed to\nhaving physical bodies.\nWhat a strange way to treat a failure. She attuned Appreciation anyway.\nAn old rhythm. She loved being able to hear those again at will—she could\nattune either old or new, and could make her eyes red, except when she\ndrew in Stormlight. Timbre had granted this by capturing the Voidspren\nwithin her.\nThis meant she could hide it from the Fused. From Odium. She stepped\naway from the cabin door and walked along the side of the ship, which\nsurged through the water, heading back toward Marat.\n“This bond was supposed to be impossible,” she whispered to Timbre.\nTimbre pulsed to Peace.\n“I’m happy too,” Venli whispered. “But why me? Why not one of the\nhumans?”\nTimbre pulsed to Irritation, then the Lost.\n“That many? I had no idea the human betrayal had cost so many of your\npeople’s lives. And your own grandfather?”\nIrritation again.\n“I’m not sure how much I trust the humans either. Eshonai did though.”\nNearby, sailors worked on the rigging, speaking softly in Thaylen.\nParshmen, yes, but also Thaylens. “I don’t know, Vldgen,” one said. “Yeah,\nsome of them weren’t so bad. But what they did to us…”\n“Does that mean we have to kill them?” his companion asked. She\ncaught a tossed rope. “It doesn’t seem right.”"

She\ncaught a tossed rope. “It doesn’t seem right.”\n“They took our culture, Vldgen,” the malen said. “They blustering took\nour entire identity. And they’ll never let a bunch of parshmen remain free.\nWatch. They’ll come for us.”\n“I’ll fight if they do,” Vldgen said. “But … I don’t know. Can’t we\nsimply enjoy being able to think? Being able to exist?” She shook her head,\nlashing a rope tight. “I just wish I knew who we were.”\nTimbre pulsed to Praise.\n“The listeners?” Venli whispered to the spren. “We didn’t do that good a\njob of resisting Odium. As soon as we got a hint of power, we came running\nback to him.” That had been her fault. She had driven them toward new\ninformation, new powers. She’d always hungered for it. Something new.\nTimbre pulsed to Consolation, but then it blended, changing once again\nto Resolve.\nVenli hummed the same transformation.\nSomething new.\nBut also something old.\nShe walked to the two sailors. They immediately stood at attention,\nsaluting her as the only Regal on the ship, holding a form of power. “I know\nwho you were,” she said to the two of them.\n“You … you do?” the femalen asked.\n“Yes.” Venli pointed. “Keep working, and let me tell you of the\nlisteners.”\n* * *\nI think you did a great job, Szeth, the sword said from Szeth’s hand as they\nrose above Thaylen City. You didn’t destroy many of them, yes, but you just\nneed some more practice!\n“Thank you, sword-nimi,” he said, reaching Nin. The Herald floated with\ntoes pointed downward, hands clasped behind his back, watching the\ndisappearing ships of the parshmen in the distance.\n“I am sorry, master,” Szeth finally said. “I have angered you.”\n“I am not your master,” Nin said. “And you have not angered me. Why\nwould I be displeased?”\n“You have determined that the parshmen are the true owners of this land,\nand that the Skybreakers should follow their laws.”\n“The very reason that we swear to something external is because we\nacknowledge that our own judgment is flawed. My judgment is flawed.” He\nnarrowed his eyes. “I used to be able to feel, Szeth-son-Neturo. I used to\nhave compassion. I can remember those days, before…”\n“The torture?” Szeth asked.\nHe nodded. “Centuries spent on Braize—the place you call Damnation—\nstole my ability to feel. We each cope somehow, but only Ishar survived\nwith his mind intact. Regardless, you are certain you wish to follow a man\nwith your oath?”\n“It is not as perfect as the law, I know,” Szeth said. “But it feels right.”\n“The law is made by men, so it is not perfect either. It is not perfection\nwe seek, for perfection is impossible. It is instead consistency. You have\nsaid the Words?”"

I swear to follow the will of Dalinar Kholin. This is my oath.”\nAt the Words, snow crystallized around him in the air, then fluttered down.\nHe felt a surge of something. Approval? From the hidden spren who only\nrarely showed itself to him, even still.\n“I believe that your Words have been accepted. Have you chosen your\nquest for the next Ideal?”\n“I will cleanse the Shin of their false leaders, so long as Dalinar Kholin\nagrees.”\n“We shall see. You may find him a harsh master.”\n“He is a good man, Nin-son-God.”\n“That is precisely why.” Nin saluted him quietly, then began to move\naway through the air. He shook his head when Szeth followed, and then he\npointed. “You must protect the man you once tried to kill, Szeth-son-\nNeturo.”\n“What if we meet on the battlefield?”\n“Then we will both fight with confidence, knowing that we obey the\nprecepts of our oaths. Farewell, Szeth-son-Neturo. I will visit you again to\noversee your training in our second art, the Surge of Division. You may\naccess that now, but take care.

She walked back to the main\nthoroughfare, passing men carrying stretchers full of the wounded.\nOtherwise, the streets were mostly empty. People had been sent to\nstormshelters or homes as Queen Fen’s soldiers gathered gemstones from\nthe reserve, rounded up Amaram’s troops, and made certain there was no\nlooting.\nShallan idled in the mouth of an alleyway. The tea was bitter, but good.\nKnowing Teshav, it probably had something in it to keep her on her feet and\nalert—scribes always knew the best teas for that.\nShe watched the people for a time, then glanced upward as Kaladin\nlanded on a rooftop nearby. He was next up for working the Oathgate,\ntaking over from Renarin.\nThe Windrunner stood like a sentinel, surveying the city. Was that going\nto become a thing for him? Always standing around up high somewhere?\nShe’d seen how envious he’d been as he’d watched those Fused, with their\nflowing robes, moving like the winds.\nShallan glanced toward the thoroughfare as she heard a familiar voice.\nAdolin hiked down the street, led by the messenger girl, who pointed him"

It looked fantastic, despite his ripped uniform and scraped face.\nPerhaps that was the advantage to persistently messy hair—he managed to\nmake it go with anything. Though she had no idea how he’d gotten so much\ndust on his uniform. Had he fought a bag of sand?\nShe pulled him against her in the mouth of the alleyway, then twisted\nand put his arm around her shoulders. “Where did you get off to?”\n“Father asked me to check on each of the Thaylen Shardbearers and\nreport. I left you a palanquin.”\n“Thank you,” she said. “I’ve been surveying the aftermath of the fight. I\nthink we did a good job. Only half the city destroyed—which is quite the\nstep up from our work in Kholinar. If we keep this up, some people might\nactually live through the end of the world.”\nHe grunted. “You seem in higher spirits than earlier.”\n“Teshav fed me tea,” she said. “I’ll probably be bouncing off the clouds\nsoon. Don’t get me laughing. I sound like an axehound puppy when I’m\nhyper.”\n“Shallan…” he said.\nShe twisted up to look at his eyes, then followed his gaze. Above,\nKaladin rose into the air to inspect something that they couldn’t see.\n“I didn’t mean to abandon you earlier,” Shallan said. “I’m sorry. I should\nnever have let you run off.”\nHe took a deep breath, then removed his arm from her shoulders.\nI’ve screwed it up! Shallan thought immediately. Stormfather. I’ve gone\nand ruined it.\n“I’ve decided,” Adolin said, “to step back.”\n“Adolin, I didn’t mean to—”\n“I have to say this, Shallan. Please.” He stood up tall, stiff. “I’m going to\nlet him have you.”\nShe blinked. “Let him have me.”\n“I’m holding you back,” Adolin said. “I see the way you two look at\neach other. I don’t want you to keep forcing yourself to spend time with me\nbecause you feel sorry for me.”\nStorms. Now he’s trying to ruin it! “No,” Shallan said. “First off, you\ndon’t get to treat me like some kind of prize. You don’t decide who gets\nme.”\n“I’m not trying to…” He took another deep breath. “Look, this is hard\nfor me, Shallan. I’m trying to do the right thing. Don’t make it harder.”\n“I don’t get a choice?”\n“You’ve made your choice. I see how you look at him.”\n“I’m an artist, Adolin. I appreciate a nice picture when I see one.\nDoesn’t mean I want to pull it off the hook and go get intimate.”\nKaladin landed on a roof in the distance, still looking the other way.\nAdolin waved toward him. “Shallan.

First the Everstorm, and its subsequent returns. The\nThaylens had only just started figuring out how to rebuild, and now had to\ndeal with more smashed buildings leading up to the corpse of the\nthunderclast, which lay like a toppled statue.\nWe can win, he thought. But each victory scars us a little more.\nIn his hand he rubbed a small stone with his thumb. Down below, in an\nalleyway off the main thoroughfare, a woman with flowing red hair kissed a\nman in a ragged and ripped uniform. Some people could celebrate despite\nthe scars. Kaladin accepted that. He merely wished he knew how they did it.\n“Kaladin?” Syl said. She wove around him as a ribbon of light. “Don’t\nfeel bad. The Words have to come in their own time. You’ll be all right.”\n“I always am.”\nHe squinted down at Shallan and Adolin, and found that he couldn’t be\nbitter. He didn’t feel resignation either. Instead he felt … agreement?\n“Oh, them,” Syl said. “Well, I know that you don’t back down from\nfights. You’ve lost the round, but—”\n“No,” he said. “Her choice is made. You can see it.”\n“I can?”\n“You should be able to.” He rubbed his finger on the rock. “I don’t think\nI loved her, Syl. I felt … something. A lightening of my burdens when I was\nnear her. She reminds me of someone.”\n“Who?”\nHe opened his palm, and she landed on it, forming into the shape of a\nyoung woman with flowing hair and dress. She bent down, inspecting the\nrock in his palm, cooing over it. Syl could still be shockingly innocent—\nwide-eyed and excited about the world.\n“That’s a nice rock,” she said, completely serious.\n“Thank you.”\n“Where did you get it?”\n“I found it on the battlefield below. If you get it wet it changes colors. It\nlooks brown, but with a little water, you can see the white, black, and grey.”\n“Oooooh.”\nHe let her inspect it for a moment more. “It’s true, then?” he finally said.\n“About the parshmen. That this was their land, their world, before we\narrived? That … that we were the Voidbringers?”\nShe nodded. “Odium is the void, Kaladin. He draws in emotion, and\ndoesn’t let it go. You … you brought him with you. I wasn’t alive then, but I\nknow this truth. He was your first god, before you turned to Honor.”\nKaladin exhaled slowly, closing his eyes.\nThe men of Bridge Four were having trouble with this idea. As well they\nshould. Others in the military didn’t care, but his men … they knew."

What would\nhappen to Hearthstone? His family? Surely in the face of the invasion, he\ncould convince his father to move to Urithiru. But what then?\nIt got so complicated.

But I\ndon’t think it actually happened like that.”\n“Then … how?” Syl asked.\n“Like this,” Kaladin said. He squinted, watching the light of a setting sun\nplay on the ocean. “They found out something they couldn’t ignore.\nEventually they had to face it.”\n“They made the wrong choice.”\nKaladin pocketed the stone. “The oaths are about perception, Syl. You\nconfirmed that. The only thing that matters is whether or not we are\nconfident that we’re obeying our principles. If we lose that confidence, then\ndropping the armor and weapons is only a formality.”\n“Kal—”\n“I’m not going to do the same,” he said. “I’d like to think that the past of\nBridge Four will make us a little more pragmatic than those ancient\nRadiants. We won’t abandon you. But finding out what we will do might\nend up being messy.”\nKaladin stepped off the building, then Lashed himself so he soared in a\nwide arc over the city. He landed on a rooftop where most of Bridge Four\nwas sharing a meal of flatbread with kuma—crushed lavis and spices. They\ncould have demanded something far better than travel rations, but they\ndidn’t seem to realize it.\nTeft stood apart, glowing softly. Kaladin waved to the other men, then\nwalked up to join Teft at the edge of the rooftop, staring out over the ocean\nbeyond.\n“Almost time to get the men back to work,” Teft noted. “King\nTaravangian wants us to fly wounded up from the triage stations to the\nOathgate. The men wanted a break for food, not that they storming did\nmuch. You’d already won this battle when we got here, Kal.”\n“I’d be dead if you hadn’t activated the Oathgate,” Kaladin said softly.\n“Somehow I knew that you would, Teft. I knew you’d come for me.”\n“Knew better than I did, then.” Teft heaved a breath.\nKaladin rested his hand on Teft’s shoulder. “I know how it feels.”"

But isn’t it supposed to feel better?\nThe longing for my moss is still storming there.”\n“It doesn’t change us, Teft. We’re still who we are.”\n“Damnation.”\nKaladin looked back at the others. Lopen was currently trying to impress\nLyn and Laran with a story about how he lost his arm. It was the seventh\nrendition Kaladin had heard, each a little different.\nBeard … Kaladin thought, feeling the loss like a stab to his side. He and\nLopen would have gotten along well.\n“It doesn’t get easier, Teft,” he said. “It gets harder, I think, the more you\nlearn about the Words. Fortunately, you do get help. You were mine when I\nneeded it. I’ll be yours.”\nTeft nodded, but then pointed. “What about him?”\nFor the first time, Kaladin realized that Rock wasn’t with the rest of the\nteam. The large Horneater was sitting—Stormlight extinguished—on the\nsteps of one of the temples down below. Shardbow across his lap. Head\nbowed. He obviously considered what he’d done to be an oath broken,\ndespite it having saved Kaladin’s life.\n“We lift the bridge together, Teft,” Kaladin said. “And we carry it.”\n* * *\nDalinar refused to leave Thaylen City immediately—but in compromise\nwith Navani, he agreed to return to his villa in the Royal Ward and rest. On\nhis way, he stopped in the temple of Talenelat—which had been cleared of\npeople to make space for the generals to meet.\nThose hadn’t arrived yet, so he had a short time to himself, looking at the\nreliefs dedicated to the Herald. He knew that he should go up and sleep, at\nleast until the Azish ambassador arrived. But something about those images\nof Talenelat’Elin, standing tall against overwhelming forces …\nDid he ever have to fight humans in one of these last stands? Dalinar\nthought. Worse, did he ever wonder about what he had done? What we all\nhad done, in taking this world?\nDalinar was still standing there when a frail figure darkened the doorway\nto the temple. “I brought my surgeons,” Taravangian said, voice echoing in\nthe large stone chamber. “They have already begun helping with the city’s\nwounded.”\n“Thank you,” Dalinar said.\nTaravangian didn’t enter. He stood, waiting, until Dalinar sighed softly.\n“You abandoned me,” he said. “You abandoned this city.”\n“I assumed that you were going to fall,” Taravangian said, “and so\npositioned myself in a way that I could seize control of the coalition.”\nDalinar started. He turned toward the old man, who stood silhouetted in\nthe doorway. “You what?”\n“I assumed that the only way for the coalition to recover from your\nmistakes was for me to take command.

For the good of Roshar, I stepped away.”\nEven after their discussions together—even knowing how Taravangian\nviewed his obligations—Dalinar was shocked. This was brutal, utilitarian\npolitics.\nTaravangian finally stepped into the chamber, trailing a wizened hand\nalong one of the wall reliefs. He joined Dalinar, and together they studied a\ncarving of a powerful man, standing tall between two pillars of stone—\nbarring the way between monsters and men.\n“You … didn’t become king of Jah Keved by accident, did you?” Dalinar\nasked.\nTaravangian shook his head. It seemed obvious to Dalinar now.\nTaravangian was easy to dismiss when you assumed he was slow of\nthought. But once you knew the truth, other mysteries began to fit into\nplace.\n“How?” Dalinar asked.\n“There’s a woman at Kharbranth,” he said. “She goes by the name Dova,\nbut we think she is Battah’Elin. A Herald. She told us the Desolation was\napproaching.” He looked to Dalinar. “I had nothing to do with the death of\nyour brother. But once I heard of what incredible things the assassin did, I\nsought him out. Years later, I located him, and gave him specific\ninstructions.…”\n* * *\nMoash stepped down out of the Kholinar palace into the shadows of a night\nthat had seemed far too long in coming.\nPeople clogged the palace gardens—humans who had been cast out of\nhomes to make way for parshmen. Some of these refugees had strung tarps\nbetween benches of shalebark, creating very low tents only a couple of feet\ntall. Lifespren bobbed among them and the garden plants.\nMoash’s target was a particular man who sat giggling in the darkness\nnear the back of the gardens. A madman with eye color lost to the night.\n“Have you seen me?” the man asked as Moash knelt.\n“No,” Moash said, then rammed the strange golden knife into the man’s\nstomach. The man took it with a quiet grunt, smiled a silly smile, then\nclosed his eyes.\n“Were you really one of them?” Moash asked. “Herald of the\nAlmighty?”\n“Was, was, was…” The man started to tremble violently, his eyes\nopening wide. “Was … no. No, what is this death? What is this death!”\nHuddled forms stirred, and some of the wiser ones scuttled away.\n“It’s taking me!” the man screamed, then looked down at the knife in\nMoash’s hand. “What is that?”\nThe man trembled for a moment more, then jerked once, going\nmotionless. When Moash pulled the yellow-white knife free, it trailed dark\nsmoke and left a blackened wound. The large sapphire at the pommel took\non a subdued glow.\nMoash glanced over his shoulder toward the Fused hanging in the night\nsky behind the palace. This murder seemed a thing that they dared not do\nthemselves. Why? What did they fear?\nMoash held the knife aloft toward them, but there were no cheers.\nNothing accompanied the act but a few muttered words from people trying"

A\nfigure known in myth and lore as the greatest human who had ever lived.\n* * *\nLopen leaped behind a rock, then grinned, spotting the little spren in the\nshape of a leaf tucked there. “Found you, naco.”\nRua transformed into the shape of a petulant young boy, maybe nine or\nten years old. Rua was his name, but “naco” was—of course—what Lopen\ncalled him.\nRua zipped into the air as a ribbon of light. Bridge Four stood near some\ntents at the bottom of Thaylen City, in the Low Ward, right in the shadow of\nthe walls. Here, a massive surgeons’ station was caring for the wounded.\n“Lopen!” Teft called. “Stop being crazy and get over here to help.”\n“I’m not crazy,” Lopen yelled back. “Sure, I’m the least crazy of this\nwhole lot! And you all know it!”\nTeft sighed, then waved to Peet and Leyten. Together, they carefully\nLashed a large platform—easily twenty feet square—into the air. It was\nfilled with recuperating wounded. The three bridgemen flew with it toward\nthe upper part of the city.\nRua zipped onto Lopen’s shoulder and formed into the shape of a young\nman, then thrust a hand toward the bridgemen and tried the gesture that\nLopen had taught him.\n“Nice,” Lopen said. “But wrong finger. Nope! Not that one either. Naco,\nthat’s your foot.”\nThe spren turned the gesture toward Lopen.\n“That’s it,” Lopen said. “You can thank me, naco, for inspiring this great\nadvance in your learning. People—and little things made out of nothing too,\nsure—are often inspired near the Lopen.”\nHe turned and strolled into a tent of wounded, the far wall of which was\ntied right onto a nice, shiny bronze portion of wall. Lopen hoped the\nThaylens would appreciate how nice it was. Who had a metal wall? Lopen\nwould put one on his palace when he built it. Thaylens were strange though.\nWhat else could you say about a people who liked it so far south, in the\ncold? The local language was practically chattering teeth.\nThis tent of wounded was filled with the people who had been deemed\ntoo healthy to deserve Renarin’s or Lift’s healing, but still needed a\nsurgeon’s care. They weren’t dying, sure, right now. Maybe later. But\neveryone was dying maybe later, so it was probably all right to ignore them\nfor someone whose guts got misplaced.\nThe moans and whimpers indicated that they found not dying\nimmediately to be a small comfort. The ardents did what they could, but\nmost of the real surgeons were set up higher in the city. Taravangian’s\nforces had finally decided to join the battle, now that all the easy stuff—like\ndying, which really didn’t take much skill—was through."

Loving a soldier was not\neasy, and now that Kaladin had returned from Alethkar alone …\nLopen moved on, and eventually settled down beside a wounded man in\na cot. Thaylen, with drooping eyebrows and a bandage around his head. He\nstared straight ahead, not blinking.\n“Want to see a trick?” Lopen asked the soldier.\nThe man shrugged.\nLopen lifted his foot up and put the boot on the man’s cot. The laces had\ncome undone, and Lopen—one hand behind his back—deftly grabbed the\nstrings and looped them around his hand, twisted them, then pulled them\ntight, using his other foot to hold one end. He wound up with an excellent\nknot with a nice bow. It was even symmetrical. Maybe he could get an\nardent to write a poem about it.\nThe soldier gave no reaction. Lopen settled back, pulling over his pack,\nwhich clinked softly. “Don’t look like that. It’s not the end of the world.”\nThe soldier cocked his head.\n“Well, sure. Technically it might be. But for the end of the world, it’s not\nso bad, right? I figured that when everything ended, we’d sink into a\nnoxious bath of pus and doom, breathing in agony as the air around us—\nsure—became molten, and we screamed a final burning scream, relishing\nthe memories of the last time a woman loved us.” Lopen tapped the man’s\ncot. “Don’t know about you, moolie, but my lungs aren’t burning. The air\ndoesn’t seem very molten. Considering how bad this could have gone,\nyou’ve got a lot to be thankful for. Remember that.”\n“I…” The man blinked.\n“I meant, remember those exact words. That’s the phrase to tell the\nwoman you’re seeing. Helps a ton.” He fished in his pack and pulled out a\nbottle of Thaylen lavis beer he’d salvaged. Rua stopped zipping around the\ntop of the tent long enough to float down and inspect it.\n“Want to see a trick?” Lopen asked.\n“A … another?” the man asked.\n“Normally, I’d pop the cap off with one of my fingernails. I have great\nHerdazian ones, extra hard. You have weaker ones like most people. So\nhere’s the trick.”\nLopen rolled up his trouser leg with one hand. He pressed the bottle—\ntop first—to his leg and then, with a quick flick, twisted off the cap. He\nraised the bottle toward the man.\nThe man reached for it with the bandaged stump of his right arm, which\nended above the elbow. He looked at it, grimaced, then reached with the left\nhand instead.\n“If you need any jokes,” Lopen said, “I’ve got a few I can’t use"

A symbol crystallized in frost on the stones around\nLopen, vanishing under the cots. The ancient symbol of the Windrunners.\n“What?” Lopen stood up. “What? Now?”\nHe heard a far-off rumbling, like thunder.\n“NOW?” Lopen said, shaking a fist at the sky. “I was saving that for a\ndramatic moment, you penhito! Why didn’t you listen earlier?

Perhaps it was his perception.\nEight days had passed since the Battle of Thaylen Field. He wasn’t\ncertain Dalinar would ever trust him again, but giving him some truth had\nbeen a calculated risk. For now, Taravangian was still part of the coalition.\nIt was good, even if … It …\nStorms. Trying to think through the fuzz in his brain was … bothersome.\n“He is weak of mind today,” Dukar announced to Mrall, Taravangian’s\nthick-armed bodyguard. “He can interact, but should not make important\npolicy decisions. We cannot trust his interpretation of the Diagram.”\n“Vargo?” Adrotagia asked. “How would you like to spend the day? In the\nVeden gardens, perhaps?”\nTaravangian opened his eyes and looked to his faithful friends. Dukar\nand Mrall. Adrotagia, who looked so old now. Did she feel as he did,\nshocked every time she looked in the mirror, wondering where the days had\ngone? When they’d been young, they’d wanted to conquer the world.\nOr save it.\n“Your Majesty?” Adrotagia asked.\nOh. Right. His mind did wander sometimes. “We cannot do anything\nuntil the Everstorm passes. Correct?”\nAdrotagia nodded, proffering her calculations. “It is nearly here.” People\nhad spent the eight days since the battle vainly hoping that the Everstorm\nhad blown itself out for good. “It’s not as strong as it was during its\nprevious cycle, but it is coming. It has already reached Azir, and should hit\nUrithiru within the hour.”"

Gvori had been accepted to study at\nthe School of Storms, which had legacy access to the Palanaeum for all\nscholars.

She had drawn him a picture of\nflowers.\nTaravangian touched the tears on his cheek as he finished reading. None\nof the three knew anything of the Diagram, and he was determined to keep\nit that way.\nAdrotagia and Dukar conversed quietly in the corner of the room,\nconfused by portions of the Diagram. They ignored Maben, the room\nservant, who felt Taravangian’s forehead, as he’d been coughing lately.\nWhat fools we can be, Taravangian said, resting fingers on the picture of\nflowers. We never know as much as we think.

He glanced toward the window, shuttered despite the fact that the\nEverstorm didn’t reach this high. “The Blackthorn could have been made an\nally. This is what the Diagram meant.”\n“No,” Taravangian said. “That is not what it meant.”\nThey looked to him. “Vargo?” Adrotagia asked.\nHe tried to find the argument to explain himself, but it was like trying to\nhold a cupful of oil in his fist.\n“We’re in a dangerous position,” Dukar said. “His Majesty revealed too\nmuch to Dalinar.

He only knows that Kharbranth\ncontrolled the assassin—and thinks that the Herald’s insanity prompted us.\nWe’re still well positioned.”\nOpen … the … window.… None of the others heard the voice.\n“The Diagram is growing too flawed,” Mrall insisted. Though he was no\nscholar, he was a full participant in their scheme. “We’ve deviated too much\nfrom its promises. Our plans need to change.”\n“It’s too late,” Adrotagia said. “The confrontation will happen soon.”\nOPEN IT.\nTaravangian rose from his seat, trembling. Adrotagia was right. The\nconfrontation predicted by the Diagram would happen soon."

The\nconfrontation predicted by the Diagram would happen soon.\nSooner, even, than she thought.\n“We must trust in the Diagram,” Taravangian whispered, as he passed by\nthem. “We must trust the version of myself that knew what to do. We must\nhave faith.”\nAdrotagia shook her head. She didn’t like it when any of them used\nwords like “faith.” He tried to remember that, and did remember it when he\nwas smart.\nStorms take you, Nightwatcher, he thought. Odium’s victory will kill you\ntoo. Couldn’t you have just gifted me, and not cursed me?\nHe’d asked for the capacity to save his people. He’d begged for\ncompassion and acumen—and he’d gotten them. Just never at the same\ntime.\nHe touched the window shutters.\n“Vargo?” Adrotagia asked. “Letting in fresh air?”\n“No, unfortunately. Something else.”\nHe opened the shutters.\nAnd was suddenly in a place of infinite light.\nThe ground beneath him glowed, and nearby, rivers flowed past, made of\nsomething molten colored gold and orange. Odium appeared to Taravangian\nas a twenty-foot-tall human with Shin eyes and a scepter. His beard was not\nwispy, like Taravangian’s had been, but neither was it bushy. It almost\nlooked like an ardent’s beard.\n“Now,” Odium said. “Taravangian, is it?” He squinted, as if seeing\nTaravangian for the first time. “Little man. Why did you write to us? Why\ndid you have your Surgebinder unlock the Oathgate, and allow our armies\nto attack Urithiru?”\n“I wish only to serve you, Great God,” Taravangian said, getting down\nonto his knees.\n“Do not prostrate yourself,” the god said, laughing. “I can see that you\nare no sycophant, and I will not be fooled by your attempts to seem one.”\nTaravangian drew in a deep breath, but remained on his knees. Today of\nall days, Odium finally contacted him in person? “I am not well today,\nGreat God. I … um … am frail and of ill health. Might I meet with you\nagain, when I am well?”\n“Poor man!” Odium said.\nA chair sprouted from the golden ground behind Taravangian, and\nOdium stepped over to him, suddenly smaller, more human sized. He gently\npushed Taravangian up and into the chair. “There. Isn’t that better?”\n“Yes … thank you.” Taravangian scrunched up his brow. This was not\nhow he’d imagined this conversation.\n“Now,” Odium said, lightly resting his scepter on Taravangian’s\nshoulder. “Do you think I will ever meet with you when you are feeling\nwell?”\n“I…”\n“Do you not realize that I chose this day specifically because of your\nailment, Taravangian? Do you really think you will ever be able to negotiate\nwith me from a position of power?”\nTaravangian licked his lips. “No.”"

We understand one another. Now, what is it you have been\ndoing.…” He stepped to the side, and a golden pedestal appeared with a\nbook on top of it. The Diagram. Odium began leafing through it, and the\ngolden landscape changed, shifting to a bedroom with fine wooden\nfurniture. Taravangian recognized it from the scribbled writing on every\nsurface—from floor to ceiling, to the headboard of the bed.\n“Taravangian!” Odium said. “This is remarkable.” The walls and\nfurniture faded, leaving behind the words, which hung in the air and started\nglowing with a golden light. “You did this without access to Fortune, or the\nSpiritual Realm? Truly incredible.”\n“Th-thank you?”\n“Allow me to show you how far I see.”\nGolden words exploded outward from the ones Taravangian had written\nin the Diagram. Millions upon millions of golden letters burned into the air,\nextending into infinity. Each took one small element that Taravangian had\nwritten, and expanded upon it in volumes and volumes’ worth of\ninformation.\nTaravangian gasped as, for a moment, he saw into eternity.\nOdium inspected words that Taravangian had once written on the side of\na dresser. “I see. Take over Alethkar? Bold plan, bold plan. But why invite\nme to attack Urithiru?”\n“We—”\n“No need! I see. Give up Thaylen City to ensure that the Blackthorn fell,\nremoving your opposition. An overture toward me, which worked,\nobviously.” Odium turned to him and smiled. A knowing, confident smile.\nDo you really think you will ever be able to negotiate with me from a\nposition of power?\nAll that writing loomed over Taravangian, blocking off the landscape\nwith millions of words. A smarter him would have tried to read it, but this\ndumber version was simply intimidated. And … could that be for his … his\ngood? Reading that would consume him. Lose him.\nMy grandchildren, he thought. The people of Kharbranth. The good\npeople of the world. He trembled to think of what might happen to them all.\nSomebody had to make the difficult decisions. He slipped off his golden\nseat as Odium studied another portion of the Diagram. There. Behind where\nthe bed had stood. A section of words that had faded from golden to black.\nWhat was that? As he drew near, Taravangian saw that the words were\nblacked out into eternity starting from this point on his wall. As if\nsomething had happened here. A ripple in what Odium could see …\nAt its root, a name. Renarin Kholin.\n“Dalinar was not supposed to Ascend,” Odium said, stepping up behind\nTaravangian.\n“You need me,” Taravangian whispered.\n“I need nobody.”\nTaravangian looked up and there, glowing in front of him, was a set of\nwords. A message from himself, in the past. Incredible! Had he somehow\nseen even this?\nThank you."

You\nmust withdraw to prevent this contest from occurring, and so must not meet\nwith Dalinar Kholin again. Otherwise, he can force you to fight. This means\nyou must let your agents do your work. You need me.”\nOdium stepped up, noting the words that Taravangian had read. Then he\nfrowned at the tears on Taravangian’s cheeks.\n“Your Passion,” Odium said, “does you credit. What is it you ask in\nbarter?”\n“Protect the people I rule.”\n“Dear Taravangian, do you not think I can see what you are planning?”\nOdium gestured toward writing where the ceiling had once stood. “You\nwould seek to become king of all humans—and then I would need to\npreserve them all. No. If you help me, I will save your family. Anyone\nwithin two generations of you.”\n“Not enough.”\n“Then we have no deal.”\nThe words started to fade all around them. Leaving him alone. Alone and\nstupid. He blinked tears from the corners of his eyes. “Kharbranth,” he said.\n“Preserve only Kharbranth. You may destroy all other nations. Just leave\nmy city. It is what I beg of you.”\nThe world was lost, humankind doomed.\nThey had planned to protect so much more. But … he saw now how\nlittle they knew. One city before the storms. One land protected, even if the\nrest had to be sacrificed.\n“Kharbranth,” Odium said. “The city itself, and any humans who have\nbeen born into it, along with their spouses. This is whom I will spare. Do\nyou agree to this?”\n“Should we write … a contract?”\n“Our word is the contract. I am not some spren of Honor, who seeks to\nobey only the strictest letter of a promise. If you have an agreement from\nme, I will keep it in spirit, not merely in word.”\nWhat else could he do? “I will take this deal,” Taravangian whispered.\n“The Diagram will serve you, in exchange for the preservation of my\npeople. But I warn you, the assassin has joined Dalinar Kholin. I was forced\nto reveal my association with him.”\n“I know,” Odium said. “You are still of use. First, I will require that\nHonorblade which you have so cleverly stolen. And then you will find out\nfor me what the Alethi have discovered about this tower.…”\n* * *\nShallan breathed out Stormlight, shaping an illusion possible only when she\nand Dalinar met. Spinning curls of mist swept out to form oceans and peaks\n—the entire continent of Roshar, a mass of vibrant colors.\nHighprinces Aladar and Hatham waved for their generals and scribes to\nwalk around the map, which filled the large room, hovering at about waist\nheight. Dalinar stood in the very center of the thing, among the mountains\nnear Urithiru, the illusion rippling and dissolving where it touched his\nuniform."

Without you, I fade.”\nBrightness Teshav stood near them, and though the woman normally\nmaintained a stoic professionalism, Shallan thought she caught a hint of an\neye roll. Well, Teshav was so old she probably forgot what it was like to\nbreathe most days, let alone what it was like to love.\nAdolin made Shallan giddy. With his warmth so close, she had trouble\nmaintaining the illusion of the map. She felt silly—they’d been betrothed\nfor months now, and she’d grown so comfortable with him. Yet something\nhad still changed. Something incredible.\nIt was finally time. The wedding date had been set for only one week\naway—once the Alethi put their minds to something, they made it happen.\nWell, that was good. Shallan wouldn’t want to go too far in a relationship\nwithout oaths, and storms, even one week was starting to sound like an\neternity.\nShe still needed to explain some things to Adolin. Most notably, the\nentire mess with the Ghostbloods. She’d done too good a job of ignoring\nthat one lately, but it would be a relief to finally have someone she could\ntalk to about it. Veil could explain—Adolin was growing accustomed to her,\nthough he wouldn’t be intimate with her. He treated her like a drinking\nbuddy, which was actually kind of working for both of them.\nDalinar walked through the illusion, holding his hand over Iri, Rira, and\nBabatharnam. “Change this part of the land to a burning gold.”\nIt took her a moment to realize he was talking to her. Stupid Adolin and\nhis stupid arms. Stupid strong yet gentle arms pressing against her, right\nbeneath her breasts …\nRight. Right. Illusion.\nShe did as Dalinar commanded, amused by how the scribes and generals\npointedly did not look at her and Adolin. Some whispered about Adolin’s\nWesterner heritage, which made him too public with his affection. His\nmixed parentage didn’t seem to concern the Alethi in most cases—they\nwere a pragmatic people, and saw his hair as a sign of other peoples\nconquered and brought into their superior culture. But they would look for\nexcuses for why he didn’t always act like they thought he should.\nBy reports via spanreed, most of the lesser kingdoms surrounding the\nPurelake had been captured by Iri—which had moved, accompanied by\nFused, to secure land they’d eyed for generations. This secured for them\nthree total Oathgates. Shallan painted those kingdoms on the map a vivid\ngold at Dalinar’s request.\nAzir and its protectorates she painted a pattern of blue and maroon, the\nsymbol the Azish scribes had chosen for the coalition between their\nkingdoms. The emperor of Azir had agreed to continue negotiations; they\nweren’t fully in the coalition. They wanted assurances that Dalinar could\ncontrol his troops.\nShe continued shading the landscape colors at Dalinar’s request. Marat"

Marat\nand those around it went gold, as did—unfortunately—Alethkar. Lands that\nhadn’t yet committed, like Shinovar and Tukar, she turned green. The result\nwas a depressing view of a continent, with far too little of it colored the\nshades of their coalition.\nThe generals began discussing tactics. They wanted to invade Tu Bayla\n—the large land that stretched between Jah Keved and the Purelake. The\nargument was that if the enemy took that, they’d divide the coalition in two.\nThe Oathgates allowed quick access to the capitals, but many cities were far\nfrom the centers of power.\nDalinar crossed the room, forming a ripple that followed in his wake. He\nstopped near where Adolin and Shallan stood by Herdaz. And Alethkar.\n“Show me Kholinar,” he said softly.\n“That’s not how it works, Brightlord,” she said. “I have to sketch\nsomething first, and…”\nHe touched her on the shoulder, and a thought entered her mind. Another\npattern.\n“This is what the Stormfather sees,” Dalinar said. “It is not specific, so\nwe won’t be able to rely on the details, but it should give us an impression.\nIf you please.”\nShallan turned and waved her hand toward the wall, painting it with\nStormlight. When the illusion took, the side of the room seemed to vanish—\nletting them look out, as if from a balcony in the sky, toward Kholinar.\nThe gate nearest them still hung broken, exposing ruined buildings\ninside—but some progress had been made toward cleaning those up.\nParshmen walked the streets and patrolled the unbroken sections of wall.\nFused coursed overhead, trailing long clothing. A flag flew from the tops of\nbuildings, red lines on black. A foreign symbol.\n“Kaladin said they weren’t here to destroy,” Adolin said, “but to\noccupy.”\n“They want their world back,” Shallan said, pushing against him,\nwanting to feel his body against hers. “Could we … just let them have what\nthey’ve taken?”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “So long as Odium leads the enemy, they will try to\nsweep us off this land, and make the world so it has no need of another\nDesolation. Because we’ll be gone.”\nThe three of them stood as if on a precipice, overlooking the city. The\nhumans toiling outside, preparing for a planting. The lines of smoke curling\nfrom inside, where lighteyed keeps had tried to hold out against the\ninvasion. The sights haunted Shallan, and she could only imagine how\nAdolin and Dalinar felt. They had protected Thaylenah, but had lost their\nhomeland.\n“There’s a traitor among us,” Dalinar said softly. “Someone attacked\nBridge Four specifically to get the Honorblade—because they needed it to\nunlock the Oathgates and let the enemy in.”\n“That,” Shallan said softly, “or it was unlocked by a Radiant who has\nchanged sides.”\nInexplicably, the Assassin in White had joined them.

He’d explained,\nfrankly and without concern, that the majority of the Order of the\nSkybreakers had chosen to serve Odium. Shallan wouldn’t have thought\nthat possible, but that—and Renarin’s bonding of a corrupted spren—\nindicated that they couldn’t trust someone simply because they’d spoken\nIdeals.\n“You think,” Adolin said, “Taravangian might have done it?”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “Why would he work with the enemy? Everything\nhe’s done so far has been to secure a safe Roshar—if through brutal means.\nStill, I have to wonder. I can’t afford to be too trusting. Hopefully that’s one\nthing Sadeas cured in me.”\nThe Blackthorn shook his head, then looked to Shallan and Adolin.\n“Either way, Alethkar needs a king. More so now than ever.”\n“The heir—” Adolin began.\n“Too young. This isn’t the time for a regency. Gavinor can be named\nyour heir, Adolin, but we must see you two married and the monarchy\nsecured. For the good of Alethkar, but also the world.” He narrowed his\neyes. “The coalition needs more than I can provide. I will continue to lead\nit, but I have never been good at diplomacy. I need someone on the throne\nwho can inspire Alethkar and command the respect of the monarchs.”\nAdolin grew tense, and Shallan took his hand, holding tight. You can be\nthis man, if you want, she thought to him. But you don’t have to be what he\nmakes of you.\n“I’ll prepare the coalition for your coronation,” Dalinar said. “Perhaps\nthe day before the wedding.” He turned to walk away. Dalinar Kholin was a\nforce like a storm. He simply blew you over, and assumed you’d always\nwanted to lie down in the first place.\nAdolin looked to Shallan, then set his jaw and seized his father by the\narm. “I killed Sadeas, Father,” Adolin whispered.\nDalinar froze.\n“It was me,” Adolin continued. “I broke the Codes of War and killed him\nin the corridor. For speaking against our family. For betraying us time and\ntime again. I stopped him because it needed to be done, and because I knew\nyou would never be able to do it.”\nDalinar turned, speaking in a harsh whisper. “What? Son, why did you\nhide this from me?”\n“Because you’re you.”\nDalinar took a deep breath. “We can fix this,” he said. “We can see that\natonement is made. It will hurt our reputation. Storms, this is not what I\nneeded now. Nonetheless, we will fix it.”\n“It’s already fixed. I’m not sorry for what I did—and I’d do it again,\nright now.”\n“We’ll talk about this further once the coronation—”\n“I’m not going to be king, Father,” Adolin said. He glanced at Shallan,\nand she nodded to him, then squeezed his hand again. “Didn’t you listen to\nwhat I just said? I broke the Codes.”\n“Everyone in this storming country breaks the Codes,” Dalinar said,"

And before you complain that none of us want it, I’d also be terrible\nat the job. You think the monarchs would listen to me?”\n“I can’t be king of Alethkar,” Dalinar said softly. “I have to lead the\nRadiants—and need to divest myself of that power in Alethkar, to move\naway from that highking nonsense. We need a ruler in Alethkar who won’t\nbe pushed over, but who can also deal with diplomats in diplomatic ways.”\n“Well, that’s not me,” Adolin repeated.\n“Who, then?” Dalinar demanded.\nShallan cocked her head. “Hey. Have you boys ever considered…”\n* * *\nPalona skimmed through the latest gossip reports out of Tashikk, looking\nfor the juicy stuff.\nAround her in the grand conference room of Urithiru, kings and princes\nsquabbled with one another. Some complained that they weren’t allowed to\njoin whatever meeting Dalinar was having on the floor above, with his\ngenerals. The Natans still complained that they should be given control of\nthe Oathgate at the Shattered Plains, while the Azish were talking—again—\nabout how God himself had apparently prophesied that Surgebinders would\ndestroy the world.\nEveryone was quite persistent, and quite loud—even those who didn’t\nspeak Alethi. You had to be very dedicated to your grousing to wait for\ninterpretation.\nSebarial—Turi—snored softly beside Palona. That was an act. He did the\nsame fake snore when she tried to tell him about the latest novel she’d read.\nThen when she quit, he got annoyed. He seemed to like hearing the stories,\nbut only as long as he could comment on how trite and feminine they were.\nShe nudged him, and he cracked an eye as she turned one of her gossip\nreports toward him, pointing at a drawing it included. “Yezier and Emul,”\nshe whispered. “The prince and princess were seen together in Thaylen\nCity, speaking intimately while their guards worked on the rubble.”\nTuri grunted.\n“Everyone thinks their romance is back on, though they can’t talk about\nit, as head monarchs in Azir are forbidden marriage without the emperor’s\nconsent. But the rumors are wrong. I think she’s been courting Halam Khal,\nthe Shardbearer.”\n“You could just go talk to her,” Turi said, pointing a lazy finger toward\nthe princess of Yezier, whose translators were complaining forcefully about\nthe dangers of Surgebinding.\n“Oh, Turi,” Palona said. “You can’t just ask people about gossip.

All of it out of Alethkar.\nMost days this week, he was the only one here working at the palace.\nThe city was slowly being reversed, humans shipped out, singers moved in\n—but they left him alone to break stones, with no overseer or guard in sight.\nSo he was surprised when he heard another pick fall beside him. He\nspun, shocked. “Khen?”\nThe beefy parshwoman started breaking rocks.\n“Khen, you were freed from your slavery,” Moash said. “Your assault on\nthe palace earned you the Passion of Mercy.”\nKhen kept working. Nam and Pal stepped in, wearing warform—two\nothers who had survived with him during the assault. Only a handful had.\nThey lifted picks and started breaking stones too.\n“Pal,” Moash said. “You—”\n“They want us to farm,” she said. “I’m tired of farming.”\n“And I’m no house servant,” Khen said. “Running drinks.” They were\nstarting to speak to rhythms, like proper singers.\n“So you’ll break rocks?” Moash asked.\n“We heard something. Made us want to be near you.”\nMoash hesitated, but then the numbness drove him to keep working, to\nhear that steady beat of metal on stone that let him pass between times.\nIt was maybe an hour later when they came for him. Nine flying Fused,\nrippling clothing pooling beneath them as they descended around Moash.\n“Leshwi?” he asked. “Ancient One?”\nShe held something before herself in two hands. A long, slender weapon.\nA Shardblade with a gentle curve, its metal largely unornamented. Elegant,\nyet somehow humble, as Shardblades went. Moash had known it as the\nsword of the Assassin in White. Now he recognized it as something else.\nThe Blade of Jezerezeh. Honorblade.\nMoash reached for it, hesitant, and Leshwi hummed a warning rhythm.\n“If you take it, you die. Moash will be no more.”\n“Moash’s world is no more,” he said, taking the Blade by the hilt. “He\nmight as well join it in the tomb.”\n“Vyre,” she said. “Join us in the sky.

So Shallan had to sit here and be fussed\nover, primped, her hair braided and her face painted by the royal Alethi\nmakeup artists. Who’d known there even was such a thing?\nShe suffered it, then was deposited on a throne while scribes lined up\nand gave her piles of keteks and glyphwards. Noura delivered a box of\nincense from the Azish emperor, along with a dried fish from Lift. A Marati\nrug came from Queen Fen. Dried fruit. Perfumes.\nA pair of boots. Ka seemed embarrassed as she opened the box and\nrevealed them as a gift from Kaladin and Bridge Four, but Shallan just\nlaughed. It was a much-needed moment of relief in the stress of the day.\nShe got gifts from professional organizations, family members, and one\nfrom each highprince except for Ialai—who had left Urithiru in disgrace.\nThough Shallan was grateful, she found herself trying to vanish into her\ndress. So many things that she didn’t want—most of all, this attention.\nWell, you’re marrying an Alethi highprince, she thought as she squirmed\non her wedding throne. What did you expect? At least she wasn’t going to\nend up as queen.\nFinally—after ardents arrived and pronounced blessings, anointings, and\nprayers—she was shuffled off into a little room by herself with a brazier, a\nwindow, and a mirror. The table held implements for her to paint a last\nprayer, so that she could meditate. Somewhere, Adolin was suffering gifts\nfrom the men. Probably swords. Lots and lots of swords.\nThe door closed, and Shallan stood facing herself in the mirror. Her\nsapphire gown was of an ancient style, with twin drooping sleeves that went\nfar beyond her hands. Small rubies woven into the embroidery glowed with\na complementary light. A golden vest draped over the shoulders, matched\nby the ornate headdress woven into her braids.\nShe wanted to shrink from it.\n“Mmm…” Pattern said. “This is a good you, Shallan.”\nA good me.

Balat, tallest and round\nfaced. Wikim, still gaunt, with skin as pale as Shallan’s. Jushu, thinner than\nshe recalled, but still plump. All three were somehow younger than she\npictured them in her head, even though it had been over a year since she’d\nseen them.\nHer brothers.\nShallan cried out in delight, throwing herself toward them, passing\nthrough a burst of joyspren like blue petals. She tried to embrace all three at\nonce, heedless of what it might do to her carefully arranged dress. “How?\nWhen? What happened?”\n“It was a long trek across Jah Keved,” Nan Balat said. “Shallan … we\ndidn’t hear anything until we were transported here through that device.\nYou’re getting married? The son of the Blackthorn?”\nSo much to tell them. Storms, these tears were going to ruin her makeup.\nShe’d have to go through it all again.\nShe found herself too overwhelmed to talk, to explain. She pulled them\ntight again, and Wikim even complained about the affection, as he always\nhad. She hadn’t seen them in how long, and he still complained? That made\nher even more giddy, for some reason.\nNavani appeared behind them, looking over Balat’s shoulder. “I will call\nfor a delay of the festivities.”\n“No!” Shallan said.\nNo. She was going to enjoy this. She pulled her brothers tight, one after\nanother. “I’ll explain after the wedding. So much to explain…”\nBalat, as she hugged him, handed her a slip of paper. “He said to give\nyou this.”\n“Who?”\n“He said you’d know.” Balat still had the haunted look that had always\nshadowed him. “What is going on? How do you know people like that?”\nShe unfolded the letter.\nIt was from Mraize.\n“Brightness,” Shallan said to Navani, “will you provide my brothers with\nseats of honor?”\n“Of course.”"

Her brothers were back. They were alive.\nA wedding gift, Mraize’s note read.\nIn payment for work done. You will find that I do keep my promises. I apologize for the\ndelay.\nI congratulate you on your upcoming nuptials, little knife. You have done well. You\nhave frightened away the Unmade who was in this tower, and in payment, we forgive a\npart of your debt owed from the destruction of our Soulcaster.\nYour next mission is equally important. One of the Unmade seems willing to break\nfrom Odium. Our good and that of your Radiant friends align. You will find this Unmade,\nand you will persuade it to serve the Ghostbloods. Barring that, you will capture it and\ndeliver it to us.\nDetails will be forthcoming.\nShe lowered the note, then burned it in the brazier meant for her prayer.\nSo Mraize knew about Sja-anat, did he? Did he know about Renarin\naccidentally bonding one of her spren? Or was that a secret Shallan actually\nhad over the Ghostbloods?\nWell, she could worry about him later. Today, she had a wedding to\nattend. She pulled open the door and strode out. Toward a celebration.\nOf being herself.\n* * *\nDalinar entered his rooms, full of food from the wedding feast, glad to\nfinally get some peace after the celebrations. The assassin settled down\noutside his door to wait, as was becoming his custom. Szeth was the only\nguard Dalinar had for the moment, as Rial and his other bodyguards were\nall in Bridge Thirteen—and that whole crew had gone up as squires to Teft.\nDalinar smiled to himself, then walked to his desk and settled down. A\nShardblade hung on the wall before him. A temporary place; he’d find it a\nhome. For now, he wanted it near. It was time.\nHe picked up the pen and started writing.\nThree weeks had seen him progress far, though he still felt uncertain as\nhe scratched out each letter. He worked at it a good hour before Navani\nreturned, slipping into their rooms. She bustled over, opening the balcony\ndoors, letting in the light of a setting sun.\nA son married. Adolin was not the man Dalinar had thought he was—but\nthen, couldn’t he forgive someone for that? He dipped his pen and\ncontinued writing. Navani walked up and placed hands on his shoulders,\nlooking at his paper.\n“Here,” Dalinar said, handing it to her. “Tell me what you think. I’ve run\ninto a problem.”\nAs she read, he resisted the urge to shift nervously. This was as bad as\nhis first day with the swordmasters. Navani nodded to herself, then smiled\nat him, dipping her pen and making a few notes on his page to explain\nmistakes. “What’s the problem?”\n“I don’t know how to write ‘I.’ ”\n“I showed you. Here, did you forget?” She wrote out a few letters. “No,"

You used this several times in this piece, so you obviously know how\nto write it.”\n“You said pronouns have a gender in the women’s formal script, and I\nrealized that the one you taught me says ‘I, being female.’ ”\nNavani hesitated, pen in her fingers. “Oh. Right. I guess … I mean …\nHuh. I don’t think there is a masculine ‘I.’ You can use the neuter, like an\nardent. Or … no, here. I’m an idiot.” She wrote some letters. “This is what\nyou use when writing a quote by a man in the first person.”\nDalinar rubbed his chin. Most words in the script were the same as the\nones from spoken conversation, but small additions—that you wouldn’t\nread out loud—changed the context. And that didn’t even count the\nundertext—the writer’s hidden commentary. Navani had explained, with\nsome embarrassment, that that was never read to a man requesting a\nreading.\nWe took Shardblades from the women, he thought, glancing at the one\nhung on the wall above his desk. And they seized literacy from us. Who got\nthe better deal, I wonder?\n“Have you thought,” Navani said, “about how Kadash and the ardents\nwill respond to you learning to read?”\n“I’ve been excommunicated already. There’s not much more they could\ndo.”\n“They could leave.”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “I don’t think they will. I actually think … I think I\nmight be getting through to Kadash. Did you see him at the wedding? He’s\nbeen reading what the ancient theologians wrote, trying to find justification\nfor modern Vorinism. He doesn’t want to believe me, but soon he won’t be\nable to help it.”\nNavani seemed skeptical.\n“Here,” Dalinar said. “How do I emphasize a word?”\n“These marks here, above and below a word you want to stress.”\nHe nodded in thanks, dipped his pen, then rewrote what he’d given to\nNavani, substituting the proper changes.\nThe most important words a man can say are, “I will do better.” These are not the most\nimportant words any man can say. I am a man, and they are what I needed to say.\nThe ancient code of the Knights Radiant says “journey before destination.” Some\nmay call it a simple platitude, but it is far more. A journey will have pain and failure. It is\nnot only the steps forward that we must accept. It is the stumbles. The trials. The\nknowledge that we will fail. That we will hurt those around us.\nBut if we stop, if we accept the person we are when we fall, the journey ends. That\nfailure becomes our destination.\nTo love the journey is to accept no such end. I have found, through painful\nexperience, that the most important step a person can take is always the next one.\nI’m certain some will feel threatened by this record. Some few may feel liberated.\nMost will simply feel that it should not exist.\nI needed to write it anyway.\nHe sat back, pleased. It seemed that in opening this doorway, he had"

He could read The Way of Kings. He could read his\nniece’s biography of Gavilar. He could write down his own orders for men\nto follow.\nMost importantly, he could write this. His thoughts. His pains. His life.\nHe looked to the side, where Navani had placed the handful of blank pages\nhe’d asked her to bring. Too few. Far, far too few.\nHe dipped his pen again. “Would you close the balcony doors again,\ngemheart?” he asked her. “The sunlight is distracting me from the other\nlight.”\n“Other light?”\nHe nodded absently. What next? He looked up again at the familiar\nShardblade. Wide like him—and thick, also like him, at times—with a hook\nshape at the end. This was the best mark of both his honor and his disgrace.\nIt should have belonged to Rock, the Horneater bridgeman. He’d killed\nAmaram and won it, along with two other Shards.\nRock had insisted that Dalinar take Oathbringer back. A debt repaid, the\nWindrunner had explained. Reluctantly, Dalinar had accepted, handling the\nShardblade only through cloth.\nAs Navani shut the balcony doors, he closed his eyes and felt the warmth\nof a distant, unseen light. Then he smiled, and—with a hand still unsteady,\nlike the legs of a child taking his first steps—he took another page and\nwrote a title for the book.\nOathbringer, My Glory and My Shame.\nWritten by the hand of Dalinar Kholin.\nEpilogue: Great Art\n“All great art is hated,” Wit said.\nHe shuffled in line—along with a couple hundred other people—one\ndreary step.\n“It is obscenely difficult—if not impossible—to make something that\nnobody hates,” Wit continued. “Conversely, it is incredibly easy—if not\nexpected—to make something that nobody loves.”\nWeeks after the fall of Kholinar, the place still smelled like smoke.\nThough the city’s new masters had moved tens of thousands of humans out\nto work farms, complete resettlement would take months, if not years.\nWit poked the man in front of him in the shoulder. “This makes sense, if\nyou think about it. Art is about emotion, examination, and going places\npeople have never gone before to discover and investigate new things. The\nonly way to create something that nobody hates is to ensure that it can’t be\nloved either. Remove enough spice from soup, and you’ll just end up with\nwater.”\nThe brutish man in front eyed him, then turned back to the line.\n“Human taste is as varied as human fingerprints,” Wit said. “Nobody\nwill like everything, everybody dislikes something, someone loves that\nthing you hate—but at least being hated is better than nothing. To risk\nmetaphor, a grand painting is often about contrast: brightest brights, darkest\ndarks. Not grey mush. That a thing is hated is not proof that it’s great art,\nbut the lack of hatred is certainly proof that it is not.”\nThey shuffled forward another step.\nHe poked the man in the shoulder again. “And so, dear sir, when I say"

You look so ugly, it seems that someone tried—and failed\n—to get the warts off your face through aggressive application of\nsandpaper. You are less a human being, and more a lump of dung with\naspirations. If someone took a stick and beat you repeatedly, it could only\nserve to improve your features.\n“Your face defies description, but only because it nauseated all the poets.\nYou are what parents use to frighten children into obedience. I’d tell you to\nput a sack over your head, but think of the poor sack! Theologians use you\nas proof that God exists, because such hideousness can only be intentional.”\nThe man didn’t respond. Wit poked him again, and he muttered\nsomething in Thaylen.\n“You … don’t speak Alethi, do you?” Wit asked. “Of course you don’t.”\nFigured.\nWell, repeating all that in Thaylen would be monotonous. So Wit cut in\nfront of the man in line. This finally provoked a response. The beefy man\ngrabbed Wit and spun him around, then punched him right in the face.\nWit fell backward onto the stone ground. The line continued its shuffling\nmotion, the occupants refusing to look at him. Cautiously, he prodded at his\nmouth. Yes … it seemed …\nOne of his teeth popped out. “Success!” he said in Thaylen, speaking\nwith a faint lisp. “Thank you, dear man. I’m glad you appreciate my\nperformance art, accomplished by cutting in front of you.”\nWit flicked the tooth aside and stood up, starting to dust off his clothing.\nHe then stopped himself. After all, he’d worked hard to place that dust. He\nshoved hands in the pockets of his ragged brown coat, then slouched his\nway through an alley. He passed groaning humans crying for deliverance,\nfor mercy. He absorbed that, letting it reflect in him.\nNot a mask he put on. Real sorrow. Real pain. Weeping echoed around\nhim as he moved into the section of town nearest the palace. Only the most\ndesperate or the most broken dared remain here, nearest the invaders and\ntheir growing seat of power.\nHe rounded to the courtyard out in front of the steps leading up. Was it\ntime for his big performance? Strangely, he found himself reluctant. Once\nhe walked up those steps, he was committing to leave the city.\nHe’d found a much better audience among these poor people than he had\namong the lighteyes of Alethkar. He’d enjoyed his time here. On the other\nhand, if Rayse learned that Wit was in the city, he’d order his forces to level\nit—and would consider that a cheap price for even the slimmest chance of\nending him.\nWit lingered, then moved through the courtyard, speaking softly with\nseveral of the people he’d come to know over the weeks. He eventually\nsquatted next to Kheni, who still rocked her empty cradle, staring with\nhaunted eyes across the square.\n“The question becomes,” he whispered to her, “how many people need"

If you’re inevitably going to\ninspire hate, then how much enjoyment is needed to balance out the risk?”\nShe didn’t respond. Her husband, as usual, hovered nearby.\n“How’s my hair?” Wit asked Kheni. “Or lack thereof?”\nAgain, no response.\n“The missing tooth is a new addition,” Wit said, poking at the hole. “I\nthink it will add that special touch.”\nHe had a few days, with his healing repressed, until the tooth grew back.\nThe right concoction had made him lose his hair in patches.\n“Should I put an eye out?”\nKheni looked at him, incredulous.\nSo you are listening. He patted her on the shoulder. One more. One more,\nthen I go.\n“Wait here,” he told her, then went walking along an alley to the north.\nHe scooped up some rags—the remnants of a spren costume. He didn’t see\nmany of those around anymore. He took a cord from his pocket and twisted\nit around the rags.\nNearby, several buildings had fallen to the thunderclast’s attacks. He felt\nlife from one, and when he drew close, a dirty little face poked out from\nsome rubble.\nHe smiled at the little girl.\n“Your teeth look funny today,” she said to him.\n“I take exception to that, as the funny part is not the teeth, but the lack of\ntooth.” He held out his hand to her, but she ducked back in.\n“I can’t leave Mama,” she whispered.\n“I understand,” Wit said. He took the rags and cord he’d worked with\nearlier, forming them into the shape of a little doll. “The answer to the\nquestion has been bothering me for some time.”\nThe little face poked out again, looking at the doll. “The question?”\n“I asked it earlier,” Wit said. “You couldn’t hear. Do you know the\nanswer?”\n“You’re weird.”\n“Right answer, but wrong question.” He walked the little doll along the\nbroken street.\n“For me?” the girl whispered.\n“I need to leave the city,” he said. “And I can’t take her with me.\nSomeone needs to care for her.”\nA grimy hand reached toward the doll, but Wit pulled it back. “She’s\nafraid of the darkness. You’ve got to keep her in the light.”\nThe hand vanished into the shadows. “I can’t leave Mama.”\n“That’s too bad,” Wit said. He raised the doll to his lips, then whispered\na choice set of words.\nWhen he set it down, it started to walk on its own. A soft gasp sounded\ninside the shadows. The little doll toddled toward the street. Step by step by\nstep …\nThe girl, maybe four years old, finally emerged from the shadows and\nran to get the doll. Wit stood and dusted off his coat, which was now grey.\nThe girl hugged the patchwork creation, and he picked her up, turning away\nfrom the broken building—and the bones of a leg sticking from the rubble\njust inside.\nHe carried the girl back to the square, then quietly pushed the empty"

The twitch of madness, the shuffle to\nhis step. He squinted one eye and hunched over, changed his breathing to\ncome raggedly, with occasional sharp intakes. He muttered to himself, and\nexposed his teeth—but not the one that was missing, for that was\nimpossible.\nHe passed into the shadow of the palace, and the sentry hovering in the\nair nearby, wind rippling her long clothing. Vatwha was her name.\nThousands of years ago, he’d shared a dance with her. Like all the others,\nshe’d later been trained to watch for him.\nBut not well enough. As he passed underneath, she gave him the barest\nof glances. He decided not to take that as an insult, as it was what he\nwanted. He needed to be soup so bland, it was water. What a conundrum. In\nthis case, his art was best when ignored.\nPerhaps he would need to revise his philosophy.\nHe passed the sentry post, and wondered if anyone else thought it\nirregular that the Fused spent so much time here near this fallen section of\nthe palace. Did anyone wonder why they worked so hard, clearing blocks,\nbreaking down walls?\nIt was good to know that his heart could still flutter at a performance. He\nducked in close to the work project, and a pair of more mundane singer\nguards cursed at him to move on toward the gardens, with the other\nbeggars. He bowed several times, then tried to sell them some trinkets from\nhis pocket.\nOne shoved him away, and so he acted panicked, scrambling past them\nand up a ramp into the work project itself. Nearby, some workers broke\nrocks, and a patch of blood stained the ground. The two singer guards\nshouted at him to get out. Wit adopted a frightened look, and hurried to\nobey, but tripped himself so he fell against the wall of the palace—a portion\nthat was still standing.\n“Look,” he whispered to the wall, “you don’t have many choices right\nnow.”\nAbove, the Fused turned to look at him.\n“I know you’d rather have someone else,” Wit said, “but it isn’t the time\nto be picky.

It seemed to be trembling.\n“Life before death, little one,” Wit whispered.\nTHE END OF\nBook Three of\nTHE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE\nARS ARCANUM\nTHE TEN ESSENCES AND THEIR HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS\nThe preceding list is an imperfect gathering of traditional Vorin symbolism\nassociated with the Ten Essences. Bound together, these form the Double\nEye of the Almighty, an eye with two pupils representing the creation of\nplants and creatures. This is also the basis for the hourglass shape that was\noften associated with the Knights Radiant.\nAncient scholars also placed the ten orders of Knights Radiant on this\nlist, alongside the Heralds themselves, who each had a classical association\nwith one of the numbers and Essences.\nI’m not certain yet how the ten levels of Voidbinding or its cousin the\nOld Magic fit into this paradigm, if indeed they can. My research suggests\nthat, indeed, there should be another series of abilities that is even more\nesoteric than the Voidbindings. Perhaps the Old Magic fits into those,\nthough I am beginning to suspect that it is something entirely different.\nNote that I currently believe the concept of the “Body Focus” to be more\na matter of philosophical interpretation than an actual attribute of this\nInvestiture and its manifestations.\nTHE TEN SURGES\nAs a complement to the Essences, the classical elements celebrated on\nRoshar, are found the Ten Surges. These, thought to be the fundamental\nforces by which the world operates, are more accurately a representation of\nthe ten basic abilities offered to the Heralds, and then the Knights Radiant,\nby their bonds.\nAdhesion: The Surge of Pressure and Vacuum\nGravitation: The Surge of Gravity\nDivision: The Surge of Destruction and Decay\nAbrasion: The Surge of Friction\nProgression: The Surge of Growth and Healing, or Regrowth\nIllumination: The Surge of Light, Sound, and Various Waveforms\nTransformation: The Surge of Soulcasting\nTransportation: The Surge of Motion and Realmatic Transition\nCohesion: The Surge of Strong Axial Interconnection\nTension: The Surge of Soft Axial Interconnection\nON THE CREATION OF FABRIALS\nFive groupings of fabrial have been discovered so far.

        "text": "Tension: The Surge of Soft Axial Interconnection\nON THE CREATION OF FABRIALS\nFive groupings of fabrial have been discovered so far. The methods of their\ncreation are carefully guarded by the artifabrian community, but they appear\nto be the work of dedicated scientists, as opposed to the more mystical\nSurgebindings once performed by the Knights Radiant. I am more and more\nconvinced that the creation of these devices requires forced enslavement of\ntransformative cognitive entities, known as “spren” to the local\ncommunities.\nALTERING FABRIALS\nAugmenters: These fabrials are crafted to enhance something. They can\ncreate heat, pain, or even a calm wind, for instance. They are powered—like\nall fabrials—by Stormlight. They seem to work best with forces, emotions,\nor sensations.\nThe so-called half-shards of Jah Keved are created with this type of\nfabrial attached to a sheet of metal, enhancing its durability. I have seen\nfabrials of this type crafted using many different kinds of gemstone; I am\nguessing that any one of the ten Polestones will work.\nDiminishers: These fabrials do the opposite of what augmenters do, and\ngenerally seem to fall under the same restrictions as their cousins. Those\nartifabrians who have taken me into confidence seem to believe that even\ngreater fabrials are possible than what have been created so far, particularly\nin regard to augmenters and diminishers.\nPAIRING FABRIALS\nConjoiners: By infusing a ruby and using methodology that has not been\nrevealed to me (though I have my suspicions), you can create a conjoined\npair of gemstones. The process requires splitting the original ruby. The two\nhalves will then create parallel reactions across a distance. Spanreeds are\none of the most common forms of this type of fabrial.\nConservation of force is maintained; for instance, if one is attached to a\nheavy stone, you will need the same strength to lift the conjoined fabrial\nthat you would need to lift the stone itself. There appears to be some sort of\nprocess used during the creation of the fabrial that influences how far apart\nthe two halves can go and still produce an effect.\nReversers: Using an amethyst instead of a ruby also creates conjoined\nhalves of a gemstone, but these two work in creating opposite reactions.\nRaise one, and the other will be pressed downward, for instance.\nThese fabrials have only just been discovered, and already the\npossibilities for exploitation are being conjectured. There appear to be some\nunexpected limitations to this form of fabrial, though I have not been able to\ndiscover what they are.\nWARNING FABRIALS\nThere is only one type of fabrial in this set, informally known as the Alerter.\nAn Alerter can warn one of a nearby object, feeling, sensation, or\nphenomenon. These fabrials use a heliodor stone as their focus. I do not\nknow whether this is the only type of gemstone that will work, or if there is\nanother reason heliodor is used.\nIn the case of this kind of fabrial, the amount of Stormlight you can\ninfuse into it affects its range. Hence the size of gemstone used is very\nimportant.\nWINDRUNNING AND LASHINGS"

Hence the size of gemstone used is very\nimportant.\nWINDRUNNING AND LASHINGS\nReports of the Assassin in White’s odd abilities have led me to some\nsources of information that, I believe, are generally unknown. The\nWindrunners were an order of the Knights Radiant, and they made use of\ntwo primary types of Surgebinding. The effects of these Surgebindings were\nknown—colloquially among the members of the order—as the Three\nLashings.\nBASIC LASHING: GRAVITATIONAL CHANGE\nThis type of Lashing was one of the most commonly used Lashings among\nthe order, though it was not the easiest to use. (That distinction belongs to\nthe Full Lashing below.) A Basic Lashing involved revoking a being’s or\nobject’s spiritual gravitational bond to the planet below, instead temporarily\nlinking that being or object to a different object or direction.\nEffectively, this creates a change in gravitational pull, twisting the\nenergies of the planet itself. A Basic Lashing allowed a Windrunner to run\nup walls, to send objects or people flying off into the air, or to create similar\neffects. Advanced uses of this type of Lashing would allow a Windrunner to\nmake himself or herself lighter by binding part of his or her mass upward.\n(Mathematically, binding a quarter of one’s mass upward would halve a\nperson’s effective weight. Binding half of one’s mass upward would create\nweightlessness.)\nMultiple Basic Lashings could also pull an object or a person’s body\ndownward at double, triple, or other multiples of its weight.\nFULL LASHING: BINDING OBJECTS TOGETHER\nA Full Lashing might seem very similar to a Basic Lashing, but they\nworked on very different principles. While one had to do with gravitation,\nthe other had to do with the force (or Surge, as the Radiants called them) of\nAdhesion—binding objects together as if they were one. I believe this Surge\nmay have had something to do with atmospheric pressure.\nTo create a Full Lashing, a Windrunner would infuse an object with\nStormlight, then press another object to it. The two objects would become\nbound together with an extremely powerful bond, nearly impossible to\nbreak. In fact, most materials would themselves break before the bond\nholding them together would.\nREVERSE LASHING: GIVING AN OBJECT A GRAVITATIONAL PULL\nI believe this may actually be a specialized version of the Basic Lashing.\nThis type of Lashing required the least amount of Stormlight of any of the\nthree Lashings. The Windrunner would infuse something, give a mental\ncommand, and create a pull to the object that yanked other objects toward\nit.\nAt its heart, this Lashing created a bubble around the object that imitated\nits spiritual link to the ground beneath it. As such, it was much harder for\nthe Lashing to affect objects touching the ground, where their link to the\nplanet was strongest. Objects falling or in flight were the easiest to\ninfluence. Other objects could be affected, but the Stormlight and skill\nrequired were much more substantial.\nLIGHTWEAVING\nA second form of Surgebinding involves the manipulation of light and\nsound in illusory tactics common throughout the cosmere.

Unlike the\nvariations present on Sel, however, this method has a powerful Spiritual\nelement, requiring not just a full mental picture of the intended creation, but\nsome level of Connection to it as well. The illusion is based not simply\nupon what the Lightweaver imagines, but upon what they desire to create.\nIn many ways, this is the most similar ability to the original Yolish\nvariant, which excites me. I wish to delve more into this ability, with the\nhope to gain a full understanding of how it relates to cognitive and spiritual\nattributes.\nSOULCASTING\nEssential to the economy of Roshar is the art of Soulcasting, in which one\nform of matter is directly transformed into another by changing its spiritual\nnature. This is performed on Roshar via the use of devices known as\nSoulcasters, and these devices (the majority of which appear to be focused\non turning stone into grain or flesh) are used to provide mobile supply for\narmies or to augment local urban food stores. This has allowed kingdoms\non Roshar—where fresh water is rarely an issue, because of highstorm rains\n—to field armies in ways that would be unthinkable elsewhere.\nWhat intrigues me most about Soulcasting, however, are the things we\ncan infer about the world and Investiture from it. For example, certain\ngemstones are requisite in producing certain results—if you wish to produce\ngrain, however, your Soulcaster must both be attuned to that transformation\nand have an emerald (not a different gemstone) attached. This creates an\neconomy based on the relative values of what the gemstones can create, not\nupon their rarity. Indeed, as the chemical structures are identical for several\nof these gemstone varieties, aside from trace impurities, the color is the\nmost important part—not their actual axial makeup. I’m certain you will\nfind this relevance of hue quite intriguing, particularly in its relationship to\nother forms of Investiture.\nThis relationship must have been essential in the local creation of the\ntable I’ve included above, which lacks some scientific merit, but is\nintrinsically tied to the folklore surrounding Soulcasting. An emerald can be\nused to create food—and thus is traditionally associated with a similar\nEssence. Indeed, on Roshar there are considered to be ten elements; not the\ntraditional four or sixteen, depending upon local tradition.\nCuriously, these gemstones seem tied to the original abilities of the\nSoulcasters who were an order of Knights Radiant—but they don’t seem\nessential to the actual operation of the Investiture when performed by a\nliving Radiant. I do not know the connection here, though it implies\nsomething valuable.\nSoulcasters, the devices, were created to imitate the abilities of the Surge\nof Soulcasting (or Transformation). This is yet another mechanical\nimitation of something once only available only to a select few within the\nbounds of an Invested Art. The Honorblades on Roshar, indeed, may be the\nvery first example of this—from thousands of years ago. I believe this has\nrelevance to the discoveries being made on Scadrial, and the\ncommoditization of Allomancy and Feruchemy.\nBOOKS BY\nBRANDON SANDERSON\nTHE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE"
