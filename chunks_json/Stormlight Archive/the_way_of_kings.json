        "text": "THE WAY OF KINGS\nTOR BOOKS BY BRANDON SANDERSON\nWarbreaker\nThe Mistborn Trilogy\nMistborn\nThe Well of Ascension\nThe Hero of Ages\nElantris\nBRANDON SANDERSON\nTHE WAY OF KINGS\nBook One of\nTHE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE\nA TOM DOHERTY ASSOCIATES BOOK • NEW YORK\nFor Emily,\nWho is too patient\nToo kindly\nAnd too wonderful\nFor words.\nBut I try anyway.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI finished the first draft of The Way of Kings in 2003, but I started working\non pieces of the book back in the late ’90s. Threads of this novel go back\neven further in my brain. No book of mine has spent longer simmering; I’ve\nspent more than a decade building this novel. And so it should be no\nsurprise that a lot of people have helped me with it. It’s going to be\nimpossible to mention them all; my memory simply isn’t that good.\nHowever, there are some major players that I would like to thank most\ndeeply.\nFirst comes my wife, Emily, to whom this book is dedicated. She gave\ngreatly of herself to see the novel come to pass. That included not only\nreading and giving advice on the manuscript, but giving up her husband\nduring long stretches of writing time. If you readers get a chance to meet\nher, some thanks might be in order. (She likes chocolate.)\nAs always, my excellent editor and agent—Moshe Feder and Joshua\nBilmes—worked quite hard on this novel. Moshe, by special note, doesn’t\nget paid more when his authors turn in 400k-word monstrosities. But he\nedited the novel without a word of complaint; his help was invaluable in\nturning it into the novel you now hold. He also got F. Paul Wilson to check\nover the medical scenes, to their great benefit.\nSpecial thanks also go to Harriet McDougal, one of the greatest editors\nof our time, who gave us a read and line edit on this novel out of the\ngoodness of her heart. Wheel of Time fans will know her as the person who\ndiscovered, edited, and then married Robert Jordan. She doesn’t do much\nediting these days outside of the Wheel of Time, and so I feel very honored\nand humbled to have her input and help here. Alan Romanczuk, working\nwith her, should also be thanked for facilitating this edit.\nAt Tor Books, Paul Stevens has been a huge help. He’s been our in-\nhouse liaison for my books, and he’s done an amazing job. Moshe and I are\nlucky to have his aid. Likewise, Irene Gallo—the art director—has been\nwonderfully helpful and patient in dealing with an intrusive author who\nwanted to do some crazy things with the artwork in his book. Many thanks\nto Irene, Justin Golenbock, Greg Collins, Karl Gold, Nathan Weaver,\nHeather Saunders, Meryl Gross, and the entire team at Tor Books. Dot Lin,\nwho was my publicist up until this book’s release (and who is now working\nto put a few extra letters after her name), was a wonderful help not just in\npublicity, but in giving me advice and a cheering section over in New York.\nThank you all.\nAnd speaking of artwork, you may notice that the interior art for this"

        "text": "publicity, but in giving me advice and a cheering section over in New York.\nThank you all.\nAnd speaking of artwork, you may notice that the interior art for this\nbook is far more extensive than what you normally find in an epic fantasy.\nThis is due to the extraordinary efforts of Greg Call, Isaac Stewart, and Ben\nMcSweeney. They worked hard, drafting artwork numerous times to get\nthings right. Ben’s work on Shallan’s sketchbook pages is simply beautiful,\na melding of my best imaginings and his artistic interpretations. Isaac, who\nalso did the interior artwork for the Mistborn novels, went far above and\nbeyond what should reasonably have been expected of him. Late nights and\ndemanding deadlines were the norm for this novel. He is to be commended.\n(The chapter icons, maps, colored endpages, and Navani notebook pages\ncame from him, if you are wondering.)\nAs always, my writing group has been an amazing help. The members\nof it are joined by a few alpha and beta readers. In no particular order, these\nare: Karen Ahlstrom, Geoff and Rachel Biesinger, Ethan Skarstedt, Nathan\nHatfield, Dan Wells, Kaylynn ZoBell, Alan and Jeanette Layton, Janci Olds,\nKristina Kugler, Steve Diamond, Brian Delambre, Jason Denzel, Mi’chelle\nTrammel, Josh Walker, Chris King, Austin and Adam Hussey, Brian T. Hill,\nand that Ben guy whose name I can’t spell right. I’m sure I’m forgetting\nsome of you. You are all wonderful people, and I’d give you Shardblades if\nI could.\nWhew. This is turning into an epic acknowledgments. But there are\nstill a few more people that need notice. The writing of these words is\nhappening right around the one year anniversary of me hiring the Inevitable\nPeter Ahlstrom as my personal assistant, editorial aid, and extra brain. If\nyou go through previous acknowledgments pages, you’ll always find him\nthere. He’s been a dear friend of mine, and an advocate of my work, for\nyears. I’m lucky to now have him working for me full time. He got up at\nthree a.m. today to get the last proofread of the book done. When you next\nsee him at a convention, buy him a block of cheese.\nI would also be remiss if I didn’t thank Tom Doherty for letting me get\naway with writing this book. It’s because of Tom’s belief in this project that\nwe were able to get away with the novel being so long, and a personal call\nfrom Tom was what managed to get Michael Whelan to do the cover. Tom\nhas given me more here than I probably deserve; this novel (at the length it\nboasts, with the number of illustrations and artwork it contains) is the type\nthat would make many publishers run away at full speed. This man is the\nreason Tor consistently releases such awesome books.\nFinally, a moment on Michael Whelan’s wonderful cover. For those\nwho haven’t heard the story, I started reading fantasy novels (indeed, I\nbecame a reader in the first place) back as a teenager because of a beautiful\nMichael Whelan cover painting. He has a unique ability to capture the true\nsoul of a book in a painting—I always knew I could trust a novel with one"

The enormous stone beast lay on its side, riblike\nprotrusions from its chest broken and cracked. The monstrosity was vaguely\nskeletal in shape, with unnaturally long limbs that sprouted from granite\nshoulders. The eyes were deep red spots on the arrowhead face, as if created\nby a fire burning deep within the stone. They faded.\nEven after all these centuries, seeing a thunderclast up close made\nKalak shiver. The beast’s hand was as long as a man was tall. He’d been\nkilled by hands like those before, and it hadn’t been pleasant.\nOf course, dying rarely was.\nHe rounded the creature, picking his way more carefully across the\nbattlefield. The plain was a place of misshapen rock and stone, natural\npillars rising around him, bodies littering the ground. Few plants lived here.\nThe stone ridges and mounds bore numerous scars. Some were\nshattered, blasted-out sections where Surgebinders had fought. Less\nfrequently, he passed cracked, oddly shaped hollows where thunderclasts\nhad ripped themselves free of the stone to join the fray.\nMany of the bodies around him were human; many were not. Blood\nmixed. Red. Orange. Violet. Though none of the bodies around him stirred,\nan indistinct haze of sounds hung in the air. Moans of pain, cries of grief.\nThey did not seem like the sounds of victory. Smoke curled from the\noccasional patches of growth or heaps of burning corpses. Even some\nsections of rock smoldered. The Dustbringers had done their work well.\nBut I survived, Kalak thought, hand to breast as he hastened to the\nmeeting place. I actually survived this time.\nThat was dangerous.

        "text": "meeting place. I actually survived this time.\nThat was dangerous. When he died, he was sent back, no choice. When\nhe survived the Desolation, he was supposed to go back as well. Back to\nthat place that he dreaded. Back to that place of pain and fire. What if he\njust decided…not to go?\nPerilous thoughts, perhaps traitorous thoughts. He hastened on his\nway.\nThe place of meeting was in the shadow of a large rock formation, a\nspire rising into the sky. As always, the ten of them had decided upon it\nbefore the battle. The survivors would make their way here. Oddly, only\none of the others was waiting for him. Jezrien. Had the other eight all died?\nIt was possible. The battle had been so furious this time, one of the worst.\nThe enemy was growing increasingly tenacious.\nBut no. Kalak frowned as he stepped up to the base of the spire. Seven\nmagnificent swords stood proudly here, driven point-first into the stone\nground. Each was a masterly work of art, flowing in design, inscribed with\nglyphs and patterns. He recognized each one. If their masters had died, the\nBlades would have vanished.\nThese Blades were weapons of power beyond even Shardblades. These\nwere unique. Precious. Jezrien stood outside the ring of swords, looking\neastward.\n“Jezrien?”\nThe figure in white and blue glanced toward him. Even after all these\ncenturies, Jezrien looked young, like a man barely into his thirtieth year. His\nshort black beard was neatly trimmed, though his once-fine clothing was\nscorched and stained with blood. He folded his arms behind his back as he\nturned to Kalak.\n“What is this, Jezrien?” Kalak asked. “Where are the others?”\n“Departed.” Jezrien’s voice was calm, deep, regal. Though he hadn’t\nworn a crown in centuries, his royal manner lingered. He always seemed to\nknow what to do. “You might call it a miracle. Only one of us died this\ntime.”\n“Talenel,” Kalak said. His was the only Blade unaccounted for.\n“Yes. He died holding that passage by the northern waterway.”\nKalak nodded. Taln had a tendency to choose seemingly hopeless\nfights and win them. He also had a tendency to die in the process. He would\nbe back now, in the place where they went between Desolations. The place\nof nightmares.\nKalak found himself shaking. When had he become so weak? “Jezrien,\nI can’t return this time.” Kalak whispered the words, stepping up and\ngripping the other man’s arm. “I can’t.”\nKalak felt something within him break at the admission. How long had\nit been? Centuries, perhaps millennia, of torture. It was so hard to keep\ntrack. Those fires, those hooks, digging into his flesh anew each day.\nSearing the skin off his arm, then burning the fat, then driving to the bone.\nHe could smell it. Almighty, he could smell it!\n“Leave your sword,” Jezrien said.\n“What?”\nJezrien nodded to the ring of weapons. “I was chosen to wait for you."

Almighty, he could smell it!\n“Leave your sword,” Jezrien said.\n“What?”\nJezrien nodded to the ring of weapons. “I was chosen to wait for you.\nWe weren’t certain if you had survived. A…a decision has been made. It is\ntime for the Oathpact to end.”\nKalak felt a sharp stab of horror. “What will that do?”\n“Ishar believes that so long as there is one of us still bound to the\nOathpact, it may be enough. There is a chance we might end the cycle of\nDesolations.”\nKalak looked into the immortal king’s eyes. Black smoke rose from a\nsmall patch to their left. Groans of the dying haunted them from behind.\nThere, in Jezrien’s eyes, Kalak saw anguish and grief. Perhaps even\ncowardice. This was a man hanging from a cliff by a thread.\nAlmighty above, Kalak thought. You’re broken too, aren’t you? They\nall were.\nKalak turned and walked to the side, where a low ridge overlooked\npart of the battlefield.\nThere were so many corpses, and among them walked the living. Men\nin primitive wraps, carrying spears topped by bronze heads. Juxtaposed\nbetween them were others in gleaming plate armor. One group walked past,\nfour men in their ragged tanned skins or shoddy leather joining a powerful\nfigure in beautiful silver plate, amazingly intricate. Such a contrast.\nJezrien stepped up beside him.\n“They see us as divinities,” Kalak whispered. “They rely upon us,\nJezrien. We’re all that they have.”\n“They have the Radiants. That will be enough.”\nKalak shook his head. “He will not remain bound by this. The enemy.\nHe will find a way around it. You know he will.”\n“Perhaps.” The king of Heralds offered no further explanation.\n“And Taln?” Kalak asked. The flesh burning. The fires. The pain over\nand over and over…\n“Better that one man should suffer than ten,” Jezrien whispered. He\nseemed so cold. Like a shadow caused by heat and light falling on someone\nhonorable and true, casting this black imitation behind.\nJezrien walked back to the ring of swords. His own Blade formed in\nhis hands, appearing from mist, wet with condensation. “It has been\ndecided, Kalak. We will go our ways, and we will not seek out one another.\nOur Blades must be left. The Oathpact ends now.” He lifted his sword and\nrammed it into the stone with the other seven.\nJezrien hesitated, looking at the sword, then bowed his head and turned\naway. As if ashamed. “We chose this burden willingly. Well, we can choose\nto drop it if we wish.”\n“What do we tell the people, Jezrien?” Kalak asked. “What will they\nsay of this day?”\n“It’s simple,” Jezrien said, walking away. “We tell them that they\nfinally won. It’s an easy enough lie. Who knows? Maybe it will turn out to\nbe true.”\nKalak watched Jezrien depart across the burned landscape.

He turned and walked in the direction opposite from Jezrien.\nAnd yet, he could not help glancing back at the ring of swords and the\nsingle open spot. The place where the tenth sword should have gone.\nThe one of them who was lost. The one they had abandoned.\nForgive us, Kalak thought, then left.\nMap of Alethkar and surroundings, created by His Majesty Gavilar\nKholin’s royal surveyors, circa 1167.\n“The love of men is a frigid thing, a mountain stream only three steps\nfrom the ice. We are his. Oh Stormfather…we are his. It is but a\nthousand days, and the Everstorm comes.”\n—Collected on the first day of the week Palah of the month Shash of\nthe year 1171, thirty-one seconds before death. Subject was a darkeyed\npregnant woman of middle years. The child did not survive.\nSzeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, wore white on the day he was\nto kill a king. The white clothing was a Parshendi tradition, foreign to him.\nBut he did as his masters required and did not ask for an explanation.\nHe sat in a large stone room, baked by enormous firepits that cast a\ngarish light upon the revelers, causing beads of sweat to form on their skin\nas they danced, and drank, and yelled, and sang, and clapped. Some fell to\nthe ground red-faced, the revelry too much for them, their stomachs proving\nto be inferior wineskins. They looked as if they were dead, at least until\ntheir friends carried them out of the feast hall to waiting beds.\nSzeth did not sway to the drums, drink the sapphire wine, or stand to\ndance. He sat on a bench at the back, a still servant in white robes. Few at\nthe treaty-signing celebration noticed him. He was just a servant, and Shin\nwere easy to ignore. Most out here in the East thought Szeth’s kind were\ndocile and harmless. They were generally right.\nThe drummers began a new rhythm. The beats shook Szeth like a\nquartet of thumping hearts, pumping waves of invisible blood through the\nroom. Szeth’s masters—who were dismissed as savages by those in more\ncivilized kingdoms—sat at their own tables. They were men with skin of\nblack marbled with red. Parshendi, they were named—cousins to the more\ndocile servant peoples known as parshmen in most of the world. An oddity.\nThey did not call themselves Parshendi; this was the Alethi name for them.\nIt meant, roughly, “parshmen who can think.” Neither side seemed to see\nthat as an insult.\nThe Parshendi had brought the musicians. At first, the Alethi lighteyes\nhad been hesitant. To them, drums were base instruments of the common,\ndarkeyed people. But wine was the great assassin of both tradition and\npropriety, and now the Alethi elite danced with abandon.\nSzeth stood and began to pick his way through the room.

But many still\ncelebrated. As he walked, Szeth was forced to step around Dalinar Kholin—\nthe king’s own brother—who slumped drunken at a small table. The aging\nbut powerfully built man kept waving away those who tried to encourage\nhim to bed. Where was Jasnah, the king’s daughter? Elhokar, the king’s son\nand heir, sat at the high table, ruling the feast in his father’s absence. He\nwas in conversation with two men, a dark-skinned Azish man who had an\nodd patch of pale skin on his cheek and a thinner, Alethi-looking man who\nkept glancing over his shoulder.\nThe heir’s feasting companions were unimportant. Szeth stayed far\nfrom the heir, skirting the sides of the room, passing the drummers.\nMusicspren zipped through the air around them, the tiny spirits taking the\nform of spinning translucent ribbons. As Szeth passed the drummers, they\nnoted him. They would withdraw soon, along with all of the other\nParshendi.\nThey did not seem offended. They did not seem angry. And yet they\nwere going to break their treaty of only a few hours. It made no sense. But\nSzeth did not ask questions.\nAt the edge of the room, he passed rows of unwavering azure lights\nthat bulged out where wall met floor. They held sapphires infused with\nStormlight. Profane. How could the men of these lands use something so\nsacred for mere illumination? Worse, the Alethi scholars were said to be\nclose to creating new Shardblades. Szeth hoped that was just wishful\nboasting. For if it did happen, the world would be changed. Likely in a way\nthat ended with people in all countries—from distant Thaylenah to towering\nJah Keved—speaking Alethi to their children.\nThey were a grand people, these Alethi. Even drunk, there was a\nnatural nobility to them. Tall and well made, the men dressed in dark silk\ncoats that buttoned down the sides of the chest and were elaborately\nembroidered in silver or gold. Each one looked a general on the field.\nThe women were even more splendid. They wore grand silk dresses,\ntightly fitted, the bright colors a contrast to the dark tones favored by the\nmen. The left sleeve of each dress was longer than the right one, covering\nthe hand. Alethi had an odd sense of propriety.\nTheir pure black hair was pinned up atop their heads, either in intricate\nweavings of braids or in loose piles. It was often woven with gold ribbons\nor ornaments, along with gems that glowed with Stormlight. Beautiful.\nProfane, but beautiful.\nSzeth left the feasting chamber behind. Just outside, he passed the\ndoorway into the Beggars’ Feast. It was an Alethi tradition, a room where\nsome of the poorest men and women in the city were given a feast\ncomplementing that of the king and his guests.

A man with a long grey and\nblack beard slumped in the doorway, smiling foolishly—though whether\nfrom wine or a weak mind, Szeth could not tell.\n“Have you seen me?” the man asked with slurred speech. He laughed,\nthen began to speak in gibberish, reaching for a wineskin. So it was drink\nafter all. Szeth brushed by, continuing past a line of statues depicting the\nTen Heralds from ancient Vorin theology. Jezerezeh, Ishi, Kelek, Talenelat.\nHe counted off each one, and realized there were only nine here. One was\nconspicuously missing. Why had Shalash’s statue been removed? King\nGavilar was said to be very devout in his Vorin worship. Too devout, by\nsome people’s standards.\nThe hallway here curved to the right, running around the perimeter of\nthe domed palace. They were on the king’s floor, two levels up, surrounded\nby rock walls, ceiling, and floor. That was profane. Stone was not to be trod\nupon. But what was he to do? He was Truthless. He did as his masters\ndemanded.\nToday, that included wearing white. Loose white trousers tied at the\nwaist with a rope, and over them a filmy shirt with long sleeves, open at the\nfront. White clothing for a killer was a tradition among the Parshendi.\nAlthough Szeth had not asked, his masters had explained why.\nWhite to be bold. White to not blend into the night. White to give\nwarning.\nFor if you were going to assassinate a man, he was entitled to see you\ncoming.\nSzeth turned right, taking the hallway directly toward the king’s\nchambers. Torches burned on the walls, their light unsatisfying to him, a\nmeal of thin broth after a long fast. Tiny flamespren danced around them,\nlike insects made solely of congealed light. The torches were useless to him.\nHe reached for his pouch and the spheres it contained, but then hesitated\nwhen he saw more of the blue lights ahead: a pair of Stormlight lamps\nhanging on the wall, brilliant sapphires glowing at their hearts. Szeth\nwalked up to one of these, holding out his hand to cup it around the glass-\nshrouded gemstone.\n“You there!” a voice called in Alethi. There were two guards at the\nintersection. Double guard, for there were savages abroad in Kholinar this\nnight. True, those savages were supposed to be allies now. But alliances\ncould be shallow things indeed.\nThis one wouldn’t last the hour.\nSzeth looked as the two guards approached. They carried spears; they\nweren’t lighteyes, and were therefore forbidden the sword. Their painted\nred breastplates were ornate, however, as were their helms. They might be\ndarkeyed, but they were high-ranking citizens with honored positions in the\nroyal guard.\nStopping a few feet away, the guard at the front gestured with his\nspear. “Go on, now. This is no place for you.” He had tan Alethi skin and a\nthin mustache that ran all the way around his mouth, becoming a beard at\nthe bottom."

It streamed\ninto him, siphoned from the twin sapphire lamps on the walls, sucked in as\nif by his deep inhalation. The Stormlight raged inside of him, and the\nhallway suddenly grew darker, falling into shade like a hilltop cut off from\nthe sun by a transient cloud.\nSzeth could feel the Light’s warmth, its fury, like a tempest that had\nbeen injected directly into his veins. The power of it was invigorating but\ndangerous. It pushed him to act. To move. To strike.\nHolding his breath, he clung to the Stormlight. He could still feel it\nleaking out. Stormlight could be held for only a short time, a few minutes at\nmost. It leaked away, the human body too porous a container. He had heard\nthat the Voidbringers could hold it in perfectly. But, then, did they even\nexist? His punishment declared that they didn’t. His honor demanded that\nthey did.\nAfire with holy energy, Szeth turned to the guards. They could see that\nhe was leaking Stormlight, wisps of it curling from his skin like\nluminescent smoke. The lead guard squinted, frowning. Szeth was sure the\nman had never seen anything like it before. As far as he knew, Szeth had\nkilled every stonewalker who had ever seen what he could do.\n“What…what are you?” The guard’s voice had lost its certainty. “Spirit\nor man?”\n“What am I?” Szeth whispered, a bit of Light leaking from his lips as\nhe looked past the man down the long hallway. “I’m…sorry.”\nSzeth blinked, Lashing himself to that distant point down the hallway.\nStormlight raged from him in a flash, chilling his skin, and the ground\nimmediately stopped pulling him downward. Instead, he was pulled toward\nthat distant point—it was as if, to him, that direction had suddenly become\ndown.\nThis was a Basic Lashing, first of his three kinds of Lashings. It gave\nhim the ability to manipulate whatever force, spren, or god it was that held\nmen to the ground. With this Lashing, he could bind people or objects to\ndifferent surfaces or in different directions.\nFrom Szeth’s perspective, the hallway was now a deep shaft down\nwhich he was falling, and the two guards stood on one of the sides. They\nwere shocked when Szeth’s feet hit them, one for each face, throwing them\nover. Szeth shifted his view and Lashed himself to the floor. Light leaked\nfrom him. The floor of the hallway again became down, and he landed\nbetween the two guards, clothes crackling and dropping flakes of frost. He\nrose, beginning the process of summoning his Shardblade.\nOne of the guards fumbled for his spear. Szeth reached down, touching\nthe soldier’s shoulder while looking up. He focused on a point above him\nwhile willing the Light out of his body and into the guard, Lashing the poor\nman to the ceiling."

He focused on a point above him\nwhile willing the Light out of his body and into the guard, Lashing the poor\nman to the ceiling.\nThe guard yelped in shock as up became down for him. Light trailing\nfrom his form, he crashed into the ceiling and dropped his spear. It was not\nLashed directly, and clattered back down to the floor near Szeth.\nTo kill. It was the greatest of sins. And yet here Szeth stood, Truthless,\nprofanely walking on stones used for building. And it would not end. As\nTruthless, there was only one life he was forbidden to take.\nAnd that was his own.\nAt the tenth beat of his heart, his Shardblade dropped into his waiting\nhand. It formed as if condensing from mist, water beading along the metal\nlength. His Shardblade was long and thin, edged on both sides, smaller than\nmost others. Szeth swept it out, carving a line in the stone floor and passing\nthrough the second guard’s neck.\nAs always, the Shardblade killed oddly; though it cut easily through\nstone, steel, or anything inanimate, the metal fuzzed when it touched living\nskin. It traveled through the guard’s neck without leaving a mark, but once\nit did, the man’s eyes smoked and burned. They blackened, shriveling up in\nhis head, and he slumped forward, dead. A Shardblade did not cut living\nflesh; it severed the soul itself.\nAbove, the first guard gasped. He’d managed to get to his feet, even\nthough they were planted on the ceiling of the hallway. “Shardbearer!” he\nshouted. “A Shardbearer assaults the king’s hall! To arms!”\nFinally, Szeth thought. Szeth’s use of Stormlight was unfamiliar to the\nguards, but they knew a Shardblade when they saw one.\nSzeth bent down and picked up the spear that had fallen from above.\nAs he did so, he released the breath he’d been holding since drawing in the\nStormlight. It sustained him while he held it, but those two lanterns hadn’t\ncontained much of it, so he would need to breathe again soon. The Light\nbegan to leak away more quickly, now that he wasn’t holding his breath.\nSzeth set the spear’s butt against the stone floor, then looked upward.\nThe guard above stopped shouting, eyes opening wide as the tails of his\nshirt began to slip downward, the earth below reasserting its dominance.\nThe Light steaming off his body dwindled.\nHe looked down at Szeth. Down at the spear tip pointing directly at his\nheart. Violet fearspren crawled out of the stone ceiling around him.\nThe Light ran out. The guard fell.\nHe screamed as he hit, the spear impaling him through the chest. Szeth\nlet the spear fall away, carried to the ground with a muffled thump by the\nbody twitching on its end. Shardblade in hand, he turned down a side\ncorridor, following the map he’d memorized. He ducked around a corner\nand flattened himself against the wall just as a troop of guards reached the\ndead men. The newcomers began shouting immediately, continuing the\nalarm.\nHis instructions were clear. Kill the king, but be seen doing it. Let the\nAlethi know he was coming and what he was doing. Why?

Why did the\nParshendi agree to this treaty, only to send an assassin the very night of its\nsigning?\nMore gemstones glowed on the walls of the hallway here. King\nGavilar liked lavish display, and he couldn’t know that he was leaving\nsources of power for Szeth to use in his Lashings. The things Szeth did\nhadn’t been seen for millennia. Histories from those times were all but\nnonexistent, and the legends were horribly inaccurate.\nSzeth peeked back out into the corridor. One of the guards at the\nintersection saw him, pointing and yelling. Szeth made sure they got a good\nlook, then ducked away. He took a deep breath as he ran, drawing in\nStormlight from the lanterns. His body came alive with it, and his speed\nincreased, his muscles bursting with energy. Light became a storm inside of\nhim; his blood thundered in his ears. It was terrible and wonderful at the\nsame time.\nTwo corridors down, one to the side. He threw open the door of a\nstorage room, then hesitated a moment—just long enough for a guard to\nround the corner and see him—before dashing into the room. Preparing for\na Full Lashing, he raised his arm and commanded the Stormlight to pool\nthere, causing the skin to burst alight with radiance. Then he flung his hand\nout toward the doorframe, spraying white luminescence across it like paint.\nHe slammed the door just as the guards arrived.\nThe Stormlight held the door in the frame with the strength of a\nhundred arms. A Full Lashing bound objects together, holding them fast\nuntil the Stormlight ran out. It took longer to create—and drained\nStormlight far more quickly—than a Basic Lashing. The door handle shook,\nand then the wood began to crack as the guards threw their weight against\nit, one man calling for an axe.\nSzeth crossed the room in rapid strides, weaving around the shrouded\nfurniture that had been stored here. It was of red cloth and deep expensive\nwoods. He reached the far wall and—preparing himself for yet another\nblasphemy—he raised his Shardblade and slashed horizontally through the\ndark grey stone. The rock sliced easily; a Shardblade could cut any\ninanimate object. Two vertical slashes followed, then one across the bottom,\ncutting a large square block. He pressed his hand against it, willing\nStormlight into the stone.\nBehind him the room’s door began to crack. He looked over his\nshoulder and focused on the shaking door, Lashing the block in that\ndirection. Frost crystallized on his clothing—Lashing something so large\nrequired a great deal of Stormlight. The tempest within him stilled, like a\nstorm reduced to a drizzle.\nHe stepped aside. The large stone block shuddered, sliding into the\nroom. Normally, moving the block would have been impossible. Its own\nweight would have held it against the stones below. Yet now, that same\nweight pulled it free; for the block, the direction of the room’s door was\ndown. With a deep grinding sound, the block slid free of the wall and\ntumbled through the air, smashing furniture."

With a deep grinding sound, the block slid free of the wall and\ntumbled through the air, smashing furniture.\nThe soldiers finally broke through the door, staggering into the room\njust as the enormous block crashed into them.\nSzeth turned his back on the terrible sound of the screams, the\nsplintering of wood, the breaking of bones. He ducked and stepped through\nhis new hole, entering the hallway outside.\nHe walked slowly, drawing Stormlight from the lamps he passed,\nsiphoning it to him and stoking anew the tempest within. As the lamps\ndimmed, the corridor darkened. A thick wooden door stood at the end, and\nas he approached, small fearspren—shaped like globs of purple goo—began\nto wriggle from the masonry, pointing toward the doorway. They were\ndrawn by the terror being felt on the other side.\nSzeth pushed the door open, entering the last corridor leading to the\nking’s chambers. Tall, red ceramic vases lined the pathway, and they were\ninterspersed with nervous soldiers. They flanked a long, narrow rug. It was\nred, like a river of blood.\nThe spearmen in front didn’t wait for him to get close. They broke into\na trot, lifting their short throwing spears. Szeth slammed his hand to the\nside, pushing Stormlight into the doorframe, using the third and final type\nof Lashing, a Reverse Lashing. This one worked differently from the other\ntwo. It did not make the doorframe emit Stormlight; indeed, it seemed to\npull nearby light into it, giving it a strange penumbra.\nThe spearmen threw, and Szeth stood still, hand on the doorframe. A\nReverse Lashing required his constant touch, but took comparatively little\nStormlight. During one, anything that approached him—particularly lighter\nobjects—was instead pulled toward the Lashing itself.\nThe spears veered in the air, splitting around him and slamming into\nthe wooden frame. As he felt them hit, Szeth leaped into the air and Lashed\nhimself to the right wall, his feet hitting the stone with a slap.\nHe immediately reoriented his perspective. To his eyes, he wasn’t\nstanding on the wall, the soldiers were, the blood-red carpet streaming\nbetween them like a long tapestry. Szeth bolted down the hallway, striking\nwith his Shardblade, shearing through the necks of two men who had\nthrown spears at him. Their eyes burned, and they collapsed.\nThe other guards in the hallway began to panic. Some tried to attack\nhim, others yelled for more help, still others cringed away from him. The\nattackers had trouble—they were disoriented by the oddity of striking at\nsomeone who hung on the wall. Szeth cut down a few, then flipped into the\nair, tucking into a roll, and Lashed himself back to the floor.\nHe hit the ground in the midst of the soldiers. Completely surrounded,\nbut holding a Shardblade.\nAccording to legend, the Shardblades were first carried by the Knights\nRadiant uncounted ages ago. Gifts of their god, granted to allow them to\nfight horrors of rock and flame, dozens of feet tall, foes whose eyes burned\nwith hatred. The Voidbringers. When your foe had skin as hard as stone"

Something supernal was required.\nSzeth rose from his crouch, loose white clothes rippling, jaw clenched\nagainst his sins. He struck out, his weapon flashing with reflected torchlight.\nElegant, wide swings. Three of them, one after another. He could neither\nclose his ears to the screams that followed nor avoid seeing the men fall.\nThey dropped round him like toys knocked over by a child’s careless kick.\nIf the Blade touched a man’s spine, he died, eyes burning. If it cut through\nthe core of a limb, it killed that limb. One soldier stumbled away from\nSzeth, arm flopping uselessly on his shoulder. He would never be able to\nfeel it or use it again.\nSzeth lowered his Shardblade, standing among the cinder-eyed\ncorpses. Here, in Alethkar, men often spoke of the legends—of mankind’s\nhard-won victory over the Voidbringers. But when weapons created to fight\nnightmares were turned against common soldiers, the lives of men became\ncheap things indeed.\nSzeth turned and continued on his way, slippered feet falling on the\nsoft red rug. The Shardblade, as always, glistened silver and clean. When\none killed with a Blade, there was no blood. That seemed like a sign. The\nShardblade was just a tool; it could not be blamed for the murders.\nThe door at the end of the hallway burst open. Szeth froze as a small\ngroup of soldiers rushed out, ushering a man in regal robes, his head ducked\nas if to avoid arrows. The soldiers wore deep blue, the color of the King’s\nGuard, and the corpses didn’t make them stop and gawk. They were\nprepared for what a Shardbearer could do. They opened a side door and\nshoved their ward through, several leveling spears at Szeth as they backed\nout.\nAnother figure stepped from the king’s quarters; he wore glistening\nblue armor made of smoothly interlocking plates. Unlike common plate\narmor, however, this armor had no leather or mail visible at the joints—just\nsmaller plates, fitting together with intricate precision. The armor was\nbeautiful, the blue inlaid with golden bands around the edges of each piece\nof plate, the helm ornamented with three waves of small, hornlike wings.\nShardplate, the customary complement to a Shardblade. The newcomer\ncarried a sword as well, an enormous Shardblade six feet long with a design\nalong the blade like burning flames, a weapon of silvery metal that gleamed\nand almost seemed to glow. A weapon designed to slay dark gods, a larger\ncounterpart to the one Szeth carried.\nSzeth hesitated. He didn’t recognize the armor; he had not been\nwarned that he would be set at this task, and hadn’t been given proper time\nto memorize the various suits of Plate or Blades owned by the Alethi. But a\nShardbearer would have to be dealt with before he chased the king; he\ncould not leave such a foe behind.\nBesides, perhaps a Shardbearer could defeat him, kill him and end his\nmiserable life.

His Lashings wouldn’t work directly on someone in\nShardplate, and the armor would enhance the man, strengthen him. Szeth’s\nhonor would not allow him to betray his mission or seek death. But if that\ndeath occurred, he would welcome it.\nThe Shardbearer struck, and Szeth Lashed himself to the side of the\nhallway, leaping with a twist and landing on the wall. He danced backward,\nBlade held at the ready. The Shardbearer fell into an aggressive posture,\nusing one of the swordplay stances favored here in the East. He moved far\nmore nimbly than one would expect for a man in such bulky armor.\nShardplate was special, as ancient and magical as the Blades it\ncomplemented.\nThe Shardbearer struck. Szeth skipped to the side and Lashed himself\nto the ceiling as the Shardbearer’s Blade sliced into the wall. Feeling a thrill\nat the contest, Szeth dashed forward and attacked downward with an\noverhand blow, trying to hit the Shardbearer’s helm. The man ducked,\ngoing down on one knee, letting Szeth’s Blade cleave empty air.\nSzeth leaped backward as the Shardbearer swung upward with his\nBlade, slicing into the ceiling. Szeth didn’t own a set of Plate himself, and\ndidn’t care to. His Lashings interfered with the gemstones that powered\nShardplate, and he had to choose one or the other.\nAs the Shardbearer turned, Szeth sprinted forward across the ceiling.\nAs expected, the Shardbearer swung again, and Szeth leaped to the side,\nrolling. He came up from his roll and flipped, Lashing himself to the floor\nagain. He spun to land on the ground behind the Shardbearer. He slammed\nhis Blade into his opponent’s open back.\nUnfortunately, there was one major advantage Plate offered: It could\nblock a Shardblade. Szeth’s weapon hit solidly, causing a web of glowing\nlines to spread out across the back of the armor, and Stormlight began to\nleak free from them. Shardplate didn’t dent or bend like common metal.\nSzeth would have to hit the Shardbearer in the same location at least once\nmore to break through.\nSzeth danced out of range as the Shardbearer swung in anger, trying to\ncut at Szeth’s knees. The tempest within Szeth gave him many advantages\n—including the ability to quickly recover from small wounds. But it would\nnot restore limbs killed by a Shardblade.\nHe rounded the Shardbearer, then picked a moment and dashed\nforward. The Shardbearer swung again, but Szeth briefly Lashed himself to\nthe ceiling for lift. He shot into the air, cresting over the swing, then\nimmediately Lashed himself back to the floor. He struck as he landed, but\nthe Shardbearer recovered quickly and executed a perfect follow-through\nstroke, coming within a finger of hitting Szeth.\nThe man was dangerously skilled with that Blade.

His Blade’s length kept Szeth at bay.\nThis is taking too long! Szeth thought. If the king slipped away into\nhiding, Szeth would fail in his mission no matter how many people he\nkilled. He ducked in for another strike, but the Shardbearer forced him\nback. Each second this fight lasted was another for the king’s escape.\nIt was time to be reckless. Szeth launched into the air, Lashing himself\nto the other end of the hallway and falling feet-first toward his adversary.\nThe Shardbearer didn’t hesitate to swing, but Szeth Lashed himself down at\nan angle, dropping immediately. The Shardblade swished through the air\nabove him.\nHe landed in a crouch, using his momentum to throw himself forward,\nand swung at the Shardbearer’s side, where the Plate had cracked. He hit\nwith a powerful blow. That piece of the Plate shattered, bits of molten metal\nstreaking away. The Shardbearer grunted, dropping to one knee, raising a\nhand to his side. Szeth raised a foot to the man’s side and shoved him\nbackward with a Stormlight-enhanced kick.\nThe heavy Shardbearer crashed into the door of the king’s quarters,\nsmashing it and falling partway into the room beyond. Szeth left him,\nducking instead through the doorway to the right, following the way the\nking had gone. The hallway here had the same red carpet, and Stormlight\nlamps on the walls gave Szeth a chance to recharge the tempest within.\nEnergy blazed within him again, and he sped up. If he could get far\nenough ahead, he could deal with the king, then turn back to fight off the\nShardbearer. It wouldn’t be easy. A Full Lashing on a doorway wouldn’t\nstop a Shardbearer, and that Plate would let the man run supernaturally fast.\nSzeth glanced over his shoulder.\nThe Shardbearer wasn’t following. The man sat up in his armor,\nlooking dazed. Szeth could just barely see him, sitting in the doorway,\nsurrounded by broken bits of wood. Perhaps Szeth had wounded him more\nthan he’d thought.\nOr maybe…\nSzeth froze. He thought of the ducked head of the man who’d been\nrushed out, face obscured. The Shardbearer still wasn’t following. He was\nso skilled. It was said that few men could rival Gavilar Kholin’s\nswordsmanship. Could it be?\nSzeth turned and dashed back, trusting his instincts. As soon as the\nShardbearer saw him, he climbed to his feet with alacrity. Szeth ran faster.\nWhat was the safest place for your king? In the hands of some guards,\nfleeing? Or protected in a suit of Shardplate, left behind, dismissed as a\nbodyguard?\nClever, Szeth thought as the formerly sluggish Shardbearer fell into\nanother battle stance. Szeth attacked with renewed vigor, swinging his\nBlade in a flurry of strikes. The Shardbearer—the king—aggressively struck\nout with broad, sweeping blows.

He timed his\nnext move, then dashed forward, ducking underneath the king’s follow-\nthrough.\nThe king, expecting another strike at his side, twisted with his arm\nheld protectively to block the hole in his Plate. That gave Szeth the room to\nrun past him and into the king’s chambers.\nThe king spun around to follow, but Szeth ran through the lavishly\nfurnished chamber, flinging out his hand, touching pieces of furniture he\npassed. He infused them with Stormlight, Lashing them to a point behind\nthe king. The furniture tumbled as if the room had been turned on its side,\ncouches, chairs, and tables dropping toward the surprised king. Gavilar\nmade the mistake of chopping at them with his Shardblade. The weapon\neasily sheared through a large couch, but the pieces still crashed into him,\nmaking him stumble. A footstool hit him next, throwing him to the ground.\nGavilar rolled out of the way of the furniture and charged forward,\nPlate leaking streams of Light from the cracked sections. Szeth gathered\nhimself, then leaped into the air, Lashing himself backward and to the right\nas the king arrived. He zipped out of the way of the king’s blow, then\nLashed himself forward with two Basic Lashings in a row. Stormlight\nflashed out of him, clothing freezing, as he was pulled toward the king at\ntwice the speed of a normal fall.\nThe king’s posture indicated surprise as Szeth lurched in midair, then\nspun toward him, swinging. He slammed his Blade into the king’s helm,\nthen immediately Lashed himself to the ceiling and fell upward, slamming\ninto the stone roof above. He’d Lashed himself in too many directions too\nquickly, and his body had lost track, making it difficult to land gracefully.\nHe stumbled back to his feet.\nBelow, the king stepped back, trying to get into position to swing up at\nSzeth. The man’s helm was cracked, leaking Stormlight, and he stood\nprotectively, defending the side with the broken plate. The king used a one-\nhanded swing, reaching for the ceiling. Szeth immediately Lashed himself\ndownward, judging that the king’s attack would leave him unable to get his\nsword back in time.\nSzeth underestimated his opponent. The king stepped into Szeth’s\nattack, trusting his helm to absorb the blow. Just as Szeth hit the helm a\nsecond time—shattering it—Gavilar punched with his off hand, slamming\nhis gauntleted fist into Szeth’s face.\nBlinding light flashed in Szeth’s eyes, a counterpoint to the sudden\nagony that crashed across his face. Everything blurred, his vision fading.\nPain. So much pain!\nHe screamed, Stormlight leaving him in a rush, and he slammed back\ninto something hard. The balcony doors. More pain broke out across his\nshoulders, as if someone had stabbed him with a hundred daggers, and he\nhit the ground and rolled to a stop, muscles trembling. The blow would\nhave killed an ordinary man.\nNo time for pain. No time for pain. No time for pain!\nHe blinked, shaking his head, the world blurry and dark. Was he blind?"

He was on the wooden balcony; the force of the\nblow had thrown him through the doors. Something was thumping. Heavy\nfootfalls. The Shardbearer!\nSzeth stumbled to his feet, vision swimming. Blood streamed from the\nside of his face, and Stormlight rose from his skin, blinding his left eye. The\nLight. It would heal him, if it could. His jaw felt unhinged. Broken? He’d\ndropped his Shardblade.\nA lumbering shadow moved in front of him; the Shardbearer’s armor\nhad leaked enough Stormlight that the king was having trouble walking.\nBut he was coming.\nSzeth screamed, kneeling, infusing Stormlight into the wooden\nbalcony, Lashing it downward. The air frosted around him. The tempest\nroared, traveling down his arms into the wood. He Lashed it downward,\nthen did it again. He Lashed a fourth time as Gavilar stepped onto the\nbalcony. It lurched under the extra weight. The wood cracked, straining.\nThe Shardbearer hesitated.\nSzeth Lashed the balcony downward a fifth time. The balcony supports\nshattered and the entire structure broke free from the building. Szeth\nscreamed through a broken jaw and used his final bit of Stormlight to Lash\nhimself to the side of the building. He fell to the side, passing the shocked\nShardbearer, then hit the wall and rolled.\nThe balcony dropped away, the king looking up with shock as he lost\nhis footing. The fall was brief. In the moonlight, Szeth watched solemnly—\nvision still fuzzy, blinded in one eye—as the structure crashed to the stone\nground below. The wall of the palace trembled, and the crash of broken\nwood echoed from the nearby buildings.\nStill standing on the side of the wall, Szeth groaned, climbing to his\nfeet. He felt weak; he’d used up his Stormlight too quickly, straining his\nbody. He stumbled down the side of the building, approaching the\nwreckage, barely able to remain standing.\nThe king was still moving. Shardplate would protect a man from such\na fall, but a large length of bloodied wood stuck up through Gavilar’s side,\npiercing him where Szeth had broken the Plate earlier. Szeth knelt down,\ninspecting the man’s pain-wracked face. Strong features, square chin, black\nbeard flecked with white, striking pale green eyes. Gavilar Kholin.\n“I…expected you…to come,” the king said between gasps.\nSzeth reached underneath the front of the man’s breastplate, tapping\nthe straps there. They unfastened, and he pulled the front of the breastplate\nfree, exposing the gemstones on its interior. Two had been cracked and\nburned out. Three still glowed. Numb, Szeth breathed in sharply, absorbing\nthe Light.\nThe storm began to rage again. More Light rose from the side of his\nface, repairing his damaged skin and bones. The pain was still great;\nStormlight healing was far from instantaneous. It would be hours before he\nrecovered."

It would be hours before he\nrecovered.\nThe king coughed. “You can tell…Thaidakar…that he’s too late….”\n“I don’t know who that is,” Szeth said, standing, his words slurring\nfrom his broken jaw. He held his hand to the side, resummoning his\nShardblade.\nThe king frowned. “Then who…? Restares? Sadeas? I never\nthought…”\n“My masters are the Parshendi,” Szeth said. Ten heartbeats passed, and\nhis Blade dropped into his hand, wet with condensation.\n“The Parshendi? That makes no sense.” Gavilar coughed, hand\nquivering, reaching toward his chest and fumbling at a pocket. He pulled\nout a small crystalline sphere tied to a chain. “You must take this. They\nmust not get it.” He seemed dazed. “Tell…tell my brother…he must find the\nmost important words a man can say….”\nGavilar fell still.\nSzeth hesitated, then knelt down and took the sphere. It was odd,\nunlike any he’d seen before. Though it was completely dark, it seemed to\nglow somehow. With a light that was black.\nThe Parshendi? Gavilar had said. That makes no sense.\n“Nothing makes sense anymore,” Szeth whispered, tucking the strange\nsphere away. “It’s all unraveling. I am sorry, King of the Alethi. I doubt that\nyou care. Not anymore, at least.” He stood up. “At least you won’t have to\nwatch the world ending with the rest of us.”\nBeside the king’s body, his Shardblade materialized from mist,\nclattering to the stones now that its master was dead. It was worth a fortune;\nkingdoms had fallen as men vied to possess a single Shardblade.\nShouts of alarm came from inside the palace. Szeth needed to go.\nBut…\nTell my brother…\nTo Szeth’s people, a dying request was sacred. He took the king’s\nhand, dipping it in the man’s own blood, then used it to scrawl on the wood,\nBrother. You must find the most important words a man can say.\nWith that, Szeth escaped into the night. He left the king’s Shardblade;\nhe had no use for it. The Blade Szeth already carried was curse enough.\n“You’ve killed me. Bastards, you’ve killed me!

I’m going to die….\n“How old are you, son?” the veteran asked. Cenn didn’t remember the\nman’s name. It was hard to recall anything while watching that other army\nform lines across the rocky battlefield. That lining up seemed so civil. Neat,\norganized. Shortspears in the front ranks, longspears and javelins next,\narchers at the sides. The darkeyed spearmen wore equipment like Cenn’s:\nleather jerkin and knee-length skirt with a simple steel cap and a matching\nbreastplate.\nMany of the lighteyes had full suits of armor. They sat astride horses,\ntheir honor guards clustering around them with breastplates that gleamed\nburgundy and deep forest green. Were there Shardbearers among them?\nBrightlord Amaram wasn’t a Shardbearer. Were any of his men? What if\nCenn had to fight one? Ordinary men didn’t kill Shardbearers. It had\nhappened so infrequently that each occurrence was now legendary.\nIt’s really happening, he thought with mounting terror. This wasn’t a\ndrill in the camp. This wasn’t training out in the fields, swinging sticks. This\nwas real. Facing that fact—his heart pounding like a frightened animal in\nhis chest, his legs unsteady—Cenn suddenly realized that he was a coward.\nHe shouldn’t have left the herds! He should never have—\n“Son?” the veteran said, voice firm. “How old are you?”\n“Fifteen, sir.”\n“And what’s your name?”\n“Cenn, sir.”\nThe mountainous, bearded man nodded. “I’m Dallet.”\n“Dallet,” Cenn repeated, still staring out at the other army. There were\nso many of them! Thousands. “I’m going to die, aren’t I?”\n“No.” Dallet had a gruff voice, but somehow that was comforting.\n“You’re going to be just fine. Keep your head on straight. Stay with the\nsquad.”\n“But I’ve barely had three months’ training!” He swore he could hear\nfaint clangs from the enemy’s armor or shields. “I can barely hold this\nspear! Stormfather, I’m dead. I can’t—”\n“Son,” Dallet interrupted, soft but firm. He raised a hand and placed it\non Cenn’s shoulder. The rim of Dallet’s large round shield reflected the light\nfrom where it hung on his back. “You are going to be fine.”\n“How can you know?” It came out as a plea.\n“Because, lad. You’re in Kaladin Stormblessed’s squad.” The other\nsoldiers nearby nodded in agreement.\nBehind them, waves and waves of soldiers were lining up—thousands\nof them. Cenn was right at the front, with Kaladin’s squad of about thirty\nother men. Why had Cenn been moved to a new squad at the last moment?\nIt had something to do with camp politics.\nWhy was this squad at the very front, where casualties were bound to\nbe the greatest?

In a moment of sheer\npanic, he nearly dropped his spear and scrambled away. Dallet’s hand\ntightened on his shoulder. Looking up into Dallet’s confident black eyes,\nCenn hesitated.\n“Did you piss before we formed ranks?” Dallet asked.\n“I didn’t have time to—”\n“Go now.”\n“Here?”\n“If you don’t, you’ll end up with it running down your leg in battle,\ndistracting you, maybe killing you. Do it.”\nEmbarrassed, Cenn handed Dallet his spear and relieved himself onto\nthe stones. When he finished, he shot glances at those next to him. None of\nKaladin’s soldiers smirked. They stood steady, spears to their sides, shields\non their backs.\nThe enemy army was almost finished. The field between the two forces\nwas bare, flat slickrock, remarkably even and smooth, broken only by\noccasional rockbuds. It would have made a good pasture. The warm wind\nblew in Cenn’s face, thick with the watery scents of last night’s highstorm.\n“Dallet!” a voice said.\nA man walked up through the ranks, carrying a shortspear that had two\nleather knife sheaths strapped to the haft. The newcomer was a young man\n—perhaps four years older than Cenn’s fifteen—but he was taller by several\nfingers than even Dallet. He wore the common leathers of a spearman, but\nunder them was a pair of dark trousers. That wasn’t supposed to be allowed.\nHis black Alethi hair was shoulder-length and wavy, his eyes a dark\nbrown. He also had knots of white cord on the shoulders of his jerkin,\nmarking him as a squadleader.\nThe thirty men around Cenn snapped to attention, raising their spears\nin salute. This is Kaladin Stormblessed? Cenn thought incredulously. This\nyouth?\n“Dallet, we’re soon going to have a new recruit,” Kaladin said. He had\na strong voice. “I need you to…” He trailed off as he noticed Cenn.\n“He found his way here just a few minutes ago, sir,” Dallet said with a\nsmile. “I’ve been gettin’ him ready.”\n“Well done,” Kaladin said. “I paid good money to get that boy away\nfrom Gare. That man’s so incompetent he might as well be fighting for the\nother side.”\nWhat? Cenn thought. Why would anyone pay to get me?\n“What do you think about the field?” Kaladin asked. Several of the\nother spearmen nearby raised hands to shade from the sun, scanning the\nrocks.\n“That dip next to the two boulders on the far right?” Dallet asked.\nKaladin shook his head. “Footing’s too rough.”\n“Aye. Perhaps it is. What about the short hill over there? Far enough to\navoid the first fall, close enough to not get too far ahead.”\nKaladin nodded, though Cenn couldn’t see what they were looking at.\n“Looks good.”\n“The rest of you louts hear that?” Dallet shouted.\nThe men raised their spears high."

Smiling! How could the man smile?\nThe enemy army was blowing horns. Did that mean they were ready? Even\nthough Cenn had just relieved himself, he felt a trickle of urine run down\nhis leg.\n“Stay firm,” Kaladin said, then trotted down the front line to talk to the\nnext squadleader over. Behind Cenn and the others, the dozens of ranks\nwere still growing. The archers on the sides prepared to fire.\n“Don’t worry, son,” Dallet said. “We’ll be fine. Squadleader Kaladin is\nlucky.”\nThe soldier on the other side of Cenn nodded. He was a lanky, red-\nhaired Veden, with darker tan skin than the Alethi. Why was he fighting in\nan Alethi army? “That’s right. Kaladin, he’s stormblessed, right sure he is.\nWe only lost…what, one man last battle?”\n“But someone did die,” Cenn said.\nDallet shrugged. “People always die. Our squad loses the fewest.\nYou’ll see.”\nKaladin finished conferring with the other squadleader, then jogged\nback to his team. Though he carried a shortspear—meant to be wielded one-\nhanded with a shield in the other hand—his was a hand longer than those\nheld by the other men.\n“At the ready, men!” Dallet called. Unlike the other squadleaders,\nKaladin didn’t fall into rank, but stood out in front of his squad.\nThe men around Cenn shuffled, excited. The sounds were repeated\nthrough the vast army, the stillness giving way before eagerness. Hundreds\nof feet shuffling, shields slapping, clasps clanking. Kaladin remained\nmotionless, staring down the other army. “Steady, men,” he said without\nturning.\nBehind, a lighteyed officer passed on horseback. “Be ready to fight! I\nwant their blood, men. Fight and kill!”\n“Steady,” Kaladin said again, after the man passed.\n“Be ready to run,” Dallet said to Cenn.\n“Run? But we’ve been trained to march in formation! To stay in our\nline!”\n“Sure,” Dallet said. “But most of the men don’t have much more\ntraining than you. Those who can fight well end up getting sent to the\nShattered Plains to battle the Parshendi. Kaladin’s trying to get us into\nshape to go there, to fight for the king.” Dallet nodded down the line. “Most\nof these here will break and charge; the lighteyes aren’t good enough\ncommanders to keep them in formation. So stay with us and run.”\n“Should I have my shield out?” Around Kaladin’s team, the other\nranks were unhooking their shields. But Kaladin’s squad left their shields\non their backs.\nBefore Dallet could answer, a horn blew from behind.\n“Go!” Dallet said."

But Kaladin’s squad left their shields\non their backs.\nBefore Dallet could answer, a horn blew from behind.\n“Go!” Dallet said.\nCenn didn’t have much choice. The entire army started moving in a\nclamor of marching boots. As Dallet had predicted, the steady march didn’t\nlast long. Some men began yelling, the roar taken up by others. Lighteyes\ncalled for them to go, run, fight. The line disintegrated.\nAs soon as that happened, Kaladin’s squad broke into a dash, running\nout into the front at full speed. Cenn scrambled to keep up, panicked and\nterrified. The ground wasn’t as smooth as it had seemed, and he nearly\ntripped on a hidden rockbud, vines withdrawn into its shell.\nHe righted himself and kept going, holding his spear in one hand, his\nshield clapping against his back. The distant army was in motion as well,\ntheir soldiers charging down the field. There was no semblance of a battle\nformation or a careful line. This wasn’t anything like the training had\nclaimed it would be.\nCenn didn’t even know who the enemy was. A landlord was\nencroaching on Brightlord Amaram’s territory—the land owned, ultimately,\nby Highprince Sadeas. It was a border skirmish, and Cenn thought it was\nwith another Alethi princedom. Why were they fighting each other? Perhaps\nthe king would have put a stop to it, but he was on the Shattered Plains,\nseeking vengeance for the murder of King Gavilar five years before.\nThe enemy had a lot of archers. Cenn’s panic climbed to a peak as the\nfirst wave of arrows flew into the air. He stumbled again, itching to take out\nhis shield. But Dallet grabbed his arm and yanked him forward.\nHundreds of arrows split the sky, dimming the sun. They arced and\nfell, dropping like skyeels upon their prey. Amaram’s soldiers raised\nshields. But not Kaladin’s squad. No shields for them.\nCenn screamed.\nAnd the arrows slammed into the middle ranks of Amaram’s army,\nbehind him. Cenn glanced over his shoulder, still running. The arrows fell\nbehind him. Soldiers screamed, arrows broke against shields; only a few\nstraggling arrows landed anywhere near the front ranks.\n“Why?” he yelled at Dallet. “How did you know?”\n“They want the arrows to hit where the men are most crowded,” the\nlarge man replied. “Where they’ll have the greatest chance of finding a\nbody.”\nSeveral other groups in the van left their shields lowered, but most ran\nawkwardly with their shields angled up to the sky, worried about arrows\nthat wouldn’t hit them. That slowed them, and they risked getting trampled\nby the men behind who were getting hit. Cenn itched to raise his shield\nanyway; it felt so wrong to run without it.\nThe second volley hit, and men screamed in pain. Kaladin’s squad\nbarreled toward the enemy soldiers, some of whom were dying to arrows\nfrom Amaram’s archers. Cenn could hear the enemy soldiers bellowing war\ncries, could make out individual faces. Suddenly, Kaladin’s squad pulled to\na halt, forming a tight group.

They’d reached the small incline that Kaladin\nand Dallet had chosen earlier.\nDallet grabbed Cenn and shoved him to the very center of the\nformation. Kaladin’s men lowered spears, pulling out shields as the enemy\nbore down on them. The charging foe used no careful formation; they didn’t\nkeep the ranks of longspears in back and shortspears in front. They all just\nran forward, yelling in a frenzy.\nCenn scrambled to get his shield unlatched from his back. Clashing\nspears rang in the air as squads engaged one another. A group of enemy\nspearmen rushed up to Kaladin’s squad, perhaps coveting the higher\nground. The three dozen attackers had some cohesion, though they weren’t\nin as tight a formation as Kaladin’s squad was.\nThe enemy seemed determined to make up for it in passion; they\nbellowed and screamed in fury, rushing Kaladin’s line. Kaladin’s team held\nrank, defending Cenn as if he were some lighteyes and they were his honor\nguard. The two forces met with a crash of metal on wood, shields slamming\ntogether. Cenn cringed back.\nIt was over in a few eyeblinks. The enemy squad pulled back, leaving\ntwo dead on the stone. Kaladin’s team hadn’t lost anyone. They held their\nbristling V formation, though one man stepped back and pulled out a\nbandage to wrap a thigh wound. The rest of the men closed in to fill the\nspot. The wounded man was hulking and thick-armed; he cursed, but the\nwound didn’t look bad. He was on his feet in a moment, but didn’t return to\nthe place where he’d been. Instead, he moved down to one end of the V\nformation, a more protected spot.\nThe battlefield was chaos. The two armies mingled indistinguishably;\nsounds of clanging, crunching, and screaming churned in the air. Many\nof the squads broke apart, members rushing from one encounter to another.\nThey moved like hunters, groups of three or four seeking lone individuals,\nthen brutally falling on them.\nKaladin’s team held its ground, engaging only enemy squads that got\ntoo close. Was this what a battle really was? Cenn’s practice had trained\nhim for long ranks of men, shoulder to shoulder. Not this frenzied\nintermixing, this brutal pandemonium. Why didn’t more hold formation?\nThe real soldiers are all gone, Cenn thought. Off fighting in a real\nbattle at the Shattered Plains. No wonder Kaladin wants to get his squad\nthere.\nSpears flashed on all sides; it was difficult to tell friend from foe,\ndespite the emblems on breastplates and colored paint on shields. The\nbattlefield broke down into hundreds of small groups, like a thousand\ndifferent wars happening at the same time.\nAfter the first few exchanges, Dallet took Cenn by the shoulder and\nplaced him in the rank at the very bottom of the V pattern. Cenn, however,\nwas worthless. When Kaladin’s team engaged enemy squads, all of his\ntraining fled him. It took everything he had to just remain there, holding his\nspear outward and trying to look threatening.\nFor the better part of an hour, Kaladin’s squad held their small hill,"

It took everything he had to just remain there, holding his\nspear outward and trying to look threatening.\nFor the better part of an hour, Kaladin’s squad held their small hill,\nworking as a team, shoulder to shoulder. Kaladin often left his position at\nthe front, rushing this way and that, banging his spear on his shield in a\nstrange rhythm.\nThose are signals, Cenn realized as Kaladin’s squad moved from the V\nshape into a ring. With the screams of the dying and the thousands of men\ncalling to others, it was nearly impossible to hear a single person’s voice.\nBut the sharp clang of the spear against the metal plate on Kaladin’s shield\nwas clear. Each time they changed formations, Dallet grabbed Cenn by the\nshoulder and steered him.\nKaladin’s team didn’t chase down stragglers. They remained on the\ndefensive. And, while several of the men in Kaladin’s team took wounds,\nnone of them fell. Their squad was too intimidating for the smaller groups,\nand larger enemy units retreated after a few exchanges, seeking easier foes.\nEventually something changed. Kaladin turned, watching the tides of\nthe battle with discerning brown eyes. He raised his spear and smacked his\nshield in a quick rhythm he hadn’t used before. Dallet grabbed Cenn by the\narm and pulled him away from the small hill. Why abandon it now?\nJust then, the larger body of Amaram’s force broke, the men scattering.\nCenn hadn’t realized how poorly the battle in this quarter had been going\nfor his side. As Kaladin’s team retreated, they passed many wounded and\ndying, and Cenn grew nauseated. Soldiers were sliced open, their insides\nspilling out.\nHe didn’t have time for horror; the retreat quickly turned into a rout.\nDallet cursed, and Kaladin beat his shield again. The squad changed\ndirection, heading eastward. There, Cenn saw, a larger group of Amaram’s\nsoldiers was holding.\nBut the enemy had seen the ranks break, and that made them bold.\nThey rushed forward in clusters, like wild axehounds hunting stray hogs.\nBefore Kaladin’s team was halfway across the field of dead and dying, a\nlarge group of enemy soldiers intercepted them. Kaladin reluctantly banged\nhis shield; his squad slowed.\nCenn felt his heart begin to thump faster and faster. Nearby, a squad of\nAmaram’s soldiers was consumed; men stumbled and fell, screaming,\ntrying to get away. The enemies used their spears like skewers, killing men\non the ground like cremlings.\nKaladin’s men met the enemy in a crash of spears and shields. Bodies\nshoved on all sides, and Cenn was spun about. In the jumble of friend and\nfoe, dying and killing, Cenn grew overwhelmed. So many men running in\nso many directions!\nHe panicked, scrambling for safety. A group of soldiers nearby wore\nAlethi uniforms. Kaladin’s squad. Cenn ran for them, but when some turned\ntoward him, Cenn was terrified to realize he didn’t recognize them. This\nwasn’t Kaladin’s squad, but a small group of unfamiliar soldiers holding an\nuneven, broken line. Wounded and terrified, they scattered as soon as an\nenemy squad got close."

Wounded and terrified, they scattered as soon as an\nenemy squad got close.\nCenn froze, holding his spear in a sweaty hand. The enemy soldiers\ncharged right for him. His instincts urged him to flee, yet he had seen so\nmany men picked off one at a time. He had to stand! He had to face them!\nHe couldn’t run, he couldn’t—\nHe yelled, stabbing his spear at the lead soldier. The man casually\nknocked the weapon aside with his shield, then drove his shortspear into\nCenn’s thigh. The pain was hot, so hot that the blood squirting out on his\nleg felt cold by comparison. Cenn gasped.\nThe soldier yanked the weapon free. Cenn stumbled backward,\ndropping his spear and shield. He fell to rocky ground, splashing in\nsomeone else’s blood. His foe raised a spear high, a looming silhouette\nagainst the stark blue sky, ready to ram it into Cenn’s heart.\nAnd then he was there.\nSquadleader. Stormblessed. Kaladin’s spear came as if out of nowhere,\nnarrowly deflecting the blow that was to have killed Cenn. Kaladin set\nhimself in front of Cenn, alone, facing down six spearmen. He didn’t flinch.\nHe charged.\nIt happened so quickly. Kaladin swept the feet from beneath the man\nwho had stabbed Cenn. Even as that man fell, Kaladin reached up and\nflipped a knife from one of the sheaths tied about his spear. His hand\nsnapped, knife flashing and hitting the thigh of a second foe. That man fell\nto one knee, screaming.\nA third man froze, looking at his fallen allies. Kaladin shoved past a\nwounded enemy and slammed his spear into the gut of the third man. A\nfourth man fell with a knife to the eye. When had Kaladin grabbed that\nknife? He spun between the last two, his spear a blur, wielding it like a\nquarterstaff. For a moment, Cenn thought he could see something\nsurrounding the squadleader. A warping of the air, like the wind itself\nbecome visible.\nI’ve lost a lot of blood. It’s flowing out so quickly….\nKaladin spun, knocking aside attacks, and the last two spearmen fell\nwith gurgles that Cenn thought sounded surprised. Foes all down, Kaladin\nturned and knelt beside Cenn. The squadleader set aside his spear and\nwhipped a white strip of cloth from his pocket, then efficiently wrapped it\ntight around Cenn’s leg. Kaladin worked with the ease of one who had\nbound wounds dozens of times before.\n“Kaladin, sir!” Cenn said, pointing at one of the soldiers Kaladin had\nwounded. The enemy man held his leg as he stumbled to his feet. In a\nsecond, however, mountainous Dallet was there, shoving the foe with his\nshield. Dallet didn’t kill the wounded man, but let him stumble away,\nunarmed.\nThe rest of the squad arrived and formed a ring around Kaladin, Dallet,\nand Cenn. Kaladin stood up, raising his spear to his shoulder; Dallet handed\nhim back his knives, retrieved from the fallen foes."

Kaladin stood up, raising his spear to his shoulder; Dallet handed\nhim back his knives, retrieved from the fallen foes.\n“Had me worried there, sir,” Dallet said. “Running off like that.”\n“I knew you’d follow,” Kaladin said. “Raise the red banner. Cyn,\nKorater, you’re going back with the boy. Dallet, hold here. Amaram’s line is\nbulging in this direction. We should be safe soon.”\n“And you, sir?” Dallet asked.\nKaladin looked across the field. A pocket had opened in the enemy\nforces, and a man rode there on a white horse, swinging about him with a\nwicked mace. He wore full plate armor, polished and gleaming silver.\n“A Shardbearer,” Cenn said.\nDallet snorted. “No, thank the Stormfather. Just a lighteyed officer.\nShardbearers are far too valuable to waste on a minor border dispute.”\nKaladin watched the lighteyes with a seething hatred. It was the same\nhatred Cenn’s father had shown when he’d spoken of chull rustlers, or the\nhatred Cenn’s mother would display when someone mentioned Kusiri, who\nhad run off with the cobbler’s son.\n“Sir?” Dallet said hesitantly.\n“Subsquads Two and Three, pincer pattern,” Kaladin said, his voice\nhard. “We’re taking a brightlord off his throne.”\n“You sure that’s wise, sir? We’ve got wounded.”\nKaladin turned toward Dallet. “That’s one of Hallaw’s officers. He\nmight be the one.”\n“You don’t know that, sir.”\n“Regardless, he’s a battalionlord. If we kill an officer that high, we’re\nall but guaranteed to be in the next group sent to the Shattered Plains. We’re\ntaking him.” His eyes grew distant. “Imagine it, Dallet. Real soldiers. A\nwarcamp with discipline and lighteyes with integrity. A place where our\nfighting will mean something.”\nDallet sighed, but nodded. Kaladin waved to a group of his soldiers;\nthen they raced across the field. A smaller group of soldiers, including\nDallet, waited behind with the wounded. One of those—a thin man with\nblack Alethi hair speckled with a handful of blond hairs, marking some\nforeign blood—pulled a long red ribbon from his pocket and attached it to\nhis spear. He held the spear aloft, letting the ribbon flap in the wind.\n“It’s a call for runners to carry our wounded off the field,” Dallet said\nto Cenn. “We’ll have you out of here soon. You were brave, standing\nagainst those six.”\n“Fleeing seemed stupid,” Cenn said, trying to take his mind off his\nthrobbing leg. “With so many wounded on the field, how can we think that\nthe runners’ll come for us?”\n“Squadleader Kaladin bribes them,” Dallet said. “They usually only\ncarry off lighteyes, but there are more runners than there are wounded\nlighteyes. The squadleader puts most of his pay into the bribes.”\n“This squad is different,” Cenn said, feeling light-headed.\n“Told you.”\n“Not because of luck. Because of training.”"

As\nKaladin had predicted, Amaram’s line was surging back, recovering.\nThe mounted enemy lighteyes from before was energetically laying\nabout with his mace. A group of his honor guard moved to one side,\nengaging Kaladin’s subsquads. The lighteyes turned his horse. He wore an\nopen-fronted helm that had sloping sides and a large set of plumes on the\ntop. Cenn couldn’t make out his eye color, but he knew it would be blue or\ngreen, maybe yellow or light grey. He was a brightlord, chosen at birth by\nthe Heralds, marked for rule.\nHe impassively regarded those who fought nearby. Then one of\nKaladin’s knives took him in the right eye.\nThe brightlord screamed, falling back off the saddle as Kaladin\nsomehow slipped through the lines and leaped upon him, spear raised.\n“Aye, it’s part training,” Dallet said, shaking his head. “But it’s mostly\nhim. He fights like a storm, that one, and thinks twice as fast as other men.\nThe way he moves sometimes…”\n“He bound my leg,” Cenn said, realizing he was beginning to speak\nnonsense due to the blood loss. Why point out the bound leg? It was a\nsimple thing.\nDallet just nodded. “He knows a lot about wounds. He can read glyphs\ntoo. He’s a strange man, for a lowly darkeyed spearman, our squadleader\nis.” He turned to Cenn. “But you should save your strength, son. The\nsquadleader won’t be pleased if we lose you, not after what he paid to get\nyou.”\n“Why?” Cenn asked. The battlefield was growing quieter, as if many\nof the dying men had already yelled themselves hoarse. Almost everyone\naround them was an ally, but Dallet still watched to make sure no enemy\nsoldiers tried to strike at Kaladin’s wounded.\n“Why, Dallet?” Cenn repeated, feeling urgent. “Why bring me into his\nsquad? Why me?”\nDallet shook his head. “It’s just how he is. Hates the thought of young\nkids like you, barely trained, going to battle. Every now and again, he grabs\none and brings him into his squad. A good half dozen of our men were once\nlike you.” Dallet’s eyes got a far-off look. “I think you all remind him of\nsomeone.”\nCenn glanced at his leg. Painspren—like small orange hands with\noverly long fingers—were crawling around him, reacting to his agony. They\nbegan turning away, scurrying in other directions, seeking other wounded.\nHis pain was fading, his leg—his whole body—feeling numb.\nHe leaned back, staring up at the sky. He could hear faint thunder. That\nwas odd. The sky was cloudless.\nDallet cursed.\nCenn turned, shocked out of his stupor. Galloping directly toward them"

Galloping directly toward them\nwas a massive black horse bearing a rider in gleaming armor that seemed to\nradiate light.

He carried a massive sword in one hand, fully as long\nas a man was tall. It wasn’t a simple, straight sword—it was curved, and the\nside that wasn’t sharp was ridged, like flowing waves. Etchings covered its\nlength.\nIt was beautiful. Like a work of art. Cenn had never seen a\nShardbearer, but he knew immediately what this was. How could he ever\nhave mistaken a simple armored lighteyes for one of these majestic\ncreatures?\nHadn’t Dallet claimed there would be no Shardbearers on this\nbattlefield? Dallet scrambled to his feet, calling for the subsquad to form up.\nCenn just sat where he was. He couldn’t have stood, not with that leg\nwound.\nHe felt so light-headed. How much blood had he lost? He could barely\nthink.\nEither way, he couldn’t fight. You didn’t fight something like this. Sun\ngleamed against that plate armor. And that gorgeous, intricate, sinuous\nsword. It was like…like the Almighty himself had taken form to walk the\nbattlefield.\nAnd why would you want to fight the Almighty?\nCenn closed his eyes.\n“Ten orders. We were loved, once. Why have you forsaken us,\nAlmighty! Shard of my soul, where have you gone?”\n—Collected on the second day of Kakash, year 1171, five seconds\nbefore death. Subject was a lighteyed woman in her third decade.\nEIGHT MONTHS LATER\nKaladin’s stomach growled as he reached through the bars and accepted the\nbowl of slop. He pulled the small bowl—more a cup—between the bars,\nsniffed it, then grimaced as the caged wagon began to roll again. The sludgy\ngrey slop was made from overcooked tallew grain, and this batch was\nflecked with crusted bits of yesterday’s meal.\nRevolting though it was, it was all he would get. He began to eat, legs\nhanging out between the bars, watching the scenery pass. The other slaves\nin his cage clutched their bowls protectively, afraid that someone might\nsteal from them. One of them tried to steal Kaladin’s food on the first day.\nHe’d nearly broken the man’s arm. Now everyone left him alone.\nSuited him just fine.\nHe ate with his fingers, careless of the dirt. He’d stopped noticing dirt\nmonths ago. He hated that he felt some of that same paranoia that the others\nshowed. How could he not, after eight months of beatings, deprivation, and\nbrutality?\nHe fought down the paranoia. He wouldn’t become like them. Even if\nhe’d given up everything else—even if all had been taken from him, even if\nthere was no longer hope of escape. This one thing he would retain. He was\na slave.

Nearby, one of the other slaves began to\ncough weakly. There were ten slaves in the wagon, all men, scraggly-\nbearded and dirty. It was one of three wagons in their caravan through the\nUnclaimed Hills.\nThe sun blazed reddish white on the horizon, like the hottest part of a\nsmith’s fire. It lit the framing clouds with a spray of color, paint thrown\ncarelessly on a canvas. Covered in tall, monotonously green grass, the hills\nseemed endless. On a nearby mound, a small figure flitted around the plants,\ndancing like a fluttering insect. The figure was amorphous, vaguely\ntranslucent. Windspren were devious spirits who had a penchant for staying\nwhere they weren’t wanted. He’d hoped that this one had gotten bored and\nleft, but as Kaladin tried to toss his wooden bowl aside, he found that it\nstuck to his fingers.\nThe windspren laughed, zipping by, nothing more than a ribbon of\nlight without form. He cursed, tugging on the bowl. Windspren often played\npranks like that. He pried at the bowl, and it eventually came free.\nGrumbling, he tossed it to one of the other slaves. The man quickly began\nto lick at the remnants of the slop.\n“Hey,” a voice whispered.\nKaladin looked to the side. A slave with dark skin and matted hair was\ncrawling up to him, timid, as if expecting Kaladin to be angry. “You’re not\nlike the others.” The slave’s black eyes glanced upward, toward Kaladin’s\nforehead, which bore three brands. The first two made a glyphpair, given to\nhim eight months ago, on his last day in Amaram’s army. The third was\nfresh, given to him by his most recent master. Shash, the last glyph read.\nDangerous.\nThe slave had his hand hidden behind his rags. A knife? No, that was\nridiculous. None of these slaves could have hidden a weapon; the leaves\nhidden in Kaladin’s belt were as close as one could get. But old instincts\ncould not be banished easily, so Kaladin watched that hand.\n“I heard the guards talking,” the slave continued, shuffling a little\ncloser. He had a twitch that made him blink too frequently. “You’ve tried to\nescape before, they said. You have escaped before.”\nKaladin made no reply.\n“Look,” the slave said, moving his hand out from behind his rags and\nrevealing his bowl of slop. It was half full. “Take me with you next time,”\nhe whispered. “I’ll give you this. Half my food from now until we get away.\nPlease.” As he spoke, he attracted a few hungerspren. They looked like\nbrown flies that flitted around the man’s head, almost too small to see.\nKaladin turned away, looking out at the endless hills and their shifting,\nmoving grasses. He rested one arm across the bars and placed his head\nagainst it, legs still hanging out.\n“Well?” the slave asked.\n“You’re an idiot. If you gave me half your food, you’d be too weak to"

It doesn’t work.”\n“But—”\n“Ten times,” Kaladin whispered. “Ten escape attempts in eight months,\nfleeing from five different masters. And how many of them worked?”\n“Well…I mean…you’re still here….”\nEight months. Eight months as a slave, eight months of slop and\nbeatings. It might as well have been an eternity. He barely remembered the\narmy anymore. “You can’t hide as a slave,” Kaladin said. “Not with that\nbrand on your forehead. Oh, I got away a few times. But they always found\nme. And then back I went.”\nOnce, men had called him lucky. Stormblessed. Those had been lies—\nif anything, Kaladin had bad luck. Soldiers were a superstitious sort, and\nthough he’d initially resisted that way of thinking, it was growing harder\nand harder. Every person he had ever tried to protect had ended up dead.\nTime and time again. And now, here he was, in an even worse situation than\nwhere he’d begun. It was better not to resist. This was his lot, and he was\nresigned to it.\nThere was a certain power in that, a freedom. The freedom of not\nhaving to care.\nThe slave eventually realized Kaladin wasn’t going to say anything\nfurther, and so he retreated, eating his slop. The wagons continued to roll,\nfields of green extending in all directions. The area around the rattling\nwagons was bare, however. When they approached, the grass pulled away,\neach individual stalk withdrawing into a pinprick hole in the stone. After the\nwagons moved on, the grass timidly poked back out and stretched its blades\ntoward the air. And so, the cages moved along what appeared to be an open\nrock highway, cleared just for them.\nThis far into the Unclaimed Hills, the highstorms were incredibly\npowerful. The plants had learned to survive. That’s what you had to do,\nlearn to survive. Brace yourself, weather the storm.\nKaladin caught a whiff of another sweaty, unwashed body and heard\nthe sound of shuffling feet. He looked suspiciously to the side, expecting\nthat same slave to be back.\nIt was a different man this time, though. He had a long black beard\nstuck with bits of food and snarled with dirt. Kaladin kept his own beard\nshorter, allowing Tvlakv’s mercenaries to hack it down periodically. Like\nKaladin, the slave wore the remains of a brown sack tied with a rag, and he\nwas darkeyed, of course—perhaps a deep dark green, though with darkeyes\nit was hard to tell. They all looked brown or black unless you caught them\nin the right light.\nThe newcomer cringed away, raising his hands. He had a rash on one\nhand, the skin just faintly discolored. He’d likely approached because he’d\nseen Kaladin respond to that other man. The slaves had been frightened of\nhim since the first day, but they were also obviously curious.\nKaladin sighed and turned away. The slave hesitantly sat down. “Mind"

The slave hesitantly sat down. “Mind\nif I ask how you became a slave, friend? Can’t help wondering. We’re all\nwondering.”\nJudging by the accent and the dark hair, the man was Alethi, like\nKaladin. Most of the slaves were. Kaladin didn’t reply to the question.\n“Me, I stole a herd of chull,” the man said. He had a raspy voice, like\nsheets of paper rubbing together. “If I’d taken one chull, they might have\njust beaten me. But a whole herd. Seventeen head…” He chuckled to\nhimself, admiring his own audacity.\nIn the far corner of the wagon, someone coughed again. They were a\nsorry lot, even for slaves. Weak, sickly, underfed. Some, like Kaladin, were\nrepeat runaways—though Kaladin was the only one with a shash brand.\nThey were the most worthless of a worthless caste, purchased at a steep\ndiscount. They were probably being taken for resale in a remote place\nwhere men were desperate for labor. There were plenty of small,\nindependent cities along the coast of the Unclaimed Hills, places where\nVorin rules governing the use of slaves were just a distant rumor.\nComing this way was dangerous. These lands were ruled by nobody,\nand by cutting across open land and staying away from established trade\nroutes, Tvlakv could easily run afoul of unemployed mercenaries. Men who\nhad no honor and no fear of slaughtering a slavemaster and his slaves in\norder to steal a few chulls and wagons.\nMen who had no honor. Were there men who had honor?\nNo, Kaladin thought. Honor died eight months ago.\n“So?” asked the scraggly-bearded man. “What did you do to get made\na slave?”\nKaladin raised his arm against the bars again. “How did you get\ncaught?”\n“Odd thing, that,” the man said. Kaladin hadn’t answered his question,\nbut he had replied. That seemed enough. “It was a woman, of course.\nShould have known she’d sell me.”\n“Shouldn’t have stolen chulls. Too slow. Horses would have been\nbetter.”\nThe man laughed riotously. “Horses? What do you think me, a\nmadman? If I’d been caught stealing those, I’d have been hanged. Chulls, at\nleast, only earned me a slave’s brand.”\nKaladin glanced to the side. This man’s forehead brand was older than\nKaladin’s, the skin around the scar faded to white. What was that glyphpair?\n“Sas morom,” Kaladin said. It was the highlord’s district where the man had\noriginally been branded.\nThe man looked up with shock. “Hey! You know glyphs?” Several of\nthe slaves nearby stirred at this oddity. “You must have an even better story\nthan I thought, friend.”\nKaladin stared out over those grasses blowing in the mild breeze.\nWhenever the wind picked up, the more sensitive of the grass stalks shrank\ndown into their burrows, leaving the landscape patchy, like the coat of a"

That windspren was still there, moving between patches of\ngrass. How long had it been following him? At least a couple of months\nnow. That was downright odd. Maybe it wasn’t the same one. They were\nimpossible to tell apart.\n“Well?” the man prodded. “Why are you here?”\n“There are many reasons why I’m here,” Kaladin said. “Failures.\nCrimes. Betrayals. Probably the same for most every one of us.”\nAround him, several of the men grunted in agreement; one of those\ngrunts then degenerated into a hacking cough. Persistent coughing, a part\nof Kaladin’s mind thought, accompanied by an excess of phlegm and\nfevered mumbling at night. Sounds like the grindings.\n“Well,” the talkative man said, “perhaps I should ask a different\nquestion. Be more specific, that’s what my mother always said. Say what\nyou mean and ask for what you want. What’s the story of you getting that\nfirst brand of yours?”\nKaladin sat, feeling the wagon thump and roll beneath him. “I killed a\nlighteyes.”\nHis unnamed companion whistled again, this time even more\nappreciative than before. “I’m surprised they let you live.”\n“Killing the lighteyes isn’t why I was made a slave,” Kaladin said.\n“It’s the one I didn’t kill that’s the problem.”\n“How’s that?”\nKaladin shook his head, then stopped answering the talkative man’s\nquestions. The man eventually wandered to the front of the wagon’s cage\nand sat down, staring at his bare feet.\nHours later, Kaladin still sat in his place, idly fingering the glyphs on his\nforehead. This was his life, day in and day out, riding in these cursed\nwagons.\nHis first brands had healed long ago, but the skin around the shash\nbrand was red, irritated, and crusted with scabs. It throbbed, almost like a\nsecond heart. It hurt even worse than the burn had when he grabbed the\nheated handle of a cooking pot as a child.\nLessons drilled into Kaladin by his father whispered in the back of his\nbrain, giving the proper way to care for a burn. Apply a salve to prevent\ninfection, wash once daily. Those memories weren’t a comfort; they were\nan annoyance. He didn’t have fourleaf sap or lister’s oil; he didn’t even\nhave water for the washing.\nThe parts of the wound that had scabbed over pulled at his skin,\nmaking his forehead feel tight. He could barely pass a few minutes without\nscrunching up his brow and irritating the wound. He’d grown accustomed\nto reaching up and wiping away the streaks of blood that trickled from the\ncracks; his right forearm was smeared with it. If he’d had a mirror, he could\nprobably have spotted tiny red rotspren gathering around the wound.\nThe sun set in the west, but the wagons kept rolling.

Violet Salas\npeeked over the horizon to the east, seeming hesitant at first, as if making\nsure the sun had vanished. It was a clear night, and the stars shivered high\nabove. Taln’s Scar—a swath of deep red stars that stood out vibrantly from\nthe twinkling white ones—was high in the sky this season.\nThat slave who’d been coughing earlier was at it again. A ragged, wet\ncough. Once, Kaladin would have been quick to go help, but something\nwithin him had changed. So many people he’d tried to help were now dead.\nIt seemed to him—irrationally—that the man would be better off without\nhis interference. After failing Tien, then Dallet and his team, then ten\nsuccessive groups of slaves, it was hard to find the will to try again.\nTwo hours past First Moon, Tvlakv finally called a halt. His two\nbrutish mercenaries climbed from their places atop their wagons, then\nmoved to build a small fire. Lanky Taran—the serving boy—tended the\nchulls. The large crustaceans were nearly as big as wagons themselves.\nThey settled down, pulling into their shells for the night with clawfuls of\ngrain. Soon they were nothing more than three lumps in the darkness,\nbarely distinguishable from boulders. Finally, Tvlakv began checking on the\nslaves one at a time, giving each a ladle of water, making certain his\ninvestments were healthy. Or, at least, as healthy as could be expected for\nthis poor lot.\nTvlakv started with the first wagon, and Kaladin—still sitting—pushed\nhis fingers into his makeshift belt, checking on the leaves he’d hidden there.\nThey crackled satisfactorily, the stiff, dried husks rough against his skin. He\nstill wasn’t certain what he was going to do with them. He’d grabbed them\non a whim during one of the sessions when he’d been allowed out of the\nwagon to stretch his legs. He doubted anyone else in the caravan knew how\nto recognize blackbane—narrow leaves on a trefoil prong—so it hadn’t\nbeen too much of a risk.\nAbsently, he took the leaves out and rubbed them between forefinger\nand palm. They had to dry before reaching their potency. Why did he carry\nthem? Did he mean to give them to Tvlakv and get revenge? Or were they a\ncontingency, to be retained in case things got too bad, too unbearable?\nSurely I haven’t fallen that far, he thought. It was just more likely his\ninstinct of securing a weapon when he saw one, no matter how unusual. The\nlandscape was dark. Salas was the smallest and dimmest of the moons, and\nwhile her violet coloring had inspired countless poets, she didn’t do much\nto help you see your hand in front of your face.\n“Oh!” a soft, feminine voice said. “What’s that?”\nA translucent figure—just a handspan tall—peeked up from over the\nedge of the floor near Kaladin.

The windspren had taken the shape of a young\nwoman—larger spren could change shapes and sizes—with an angular face\nand long, flowing hair that faded into mist behind her head. She—Kaladin\ncouldn’t help but think of the windspren as a she—was formed of pale blues\nand whites and wore a simple, flowing white dress of a girlish cut that came\ndown to midcalf. Like the hair, it faded to mist at the very bottom. Her feet,\nhands, and face were crisply distinct, and she had the hips and bust of a\nslender woman.\nKaladin frowned at the spirit. Spren were all around; you just ignored\nthem most of the time. But this one was an oddity. The windspren walked\nupward, as if climbing an invisible staircase. She reached a height where\nshe could stare at Kaladin’s hand, so he closed his fingers around the black\nleaves. She walked around his fist in a circle. Although she glowed like an\nafterimage from looking at the sun, her form provided no real illumination.\nShe bent down, looking at his hand from different angles, like a child\nexpecting to find a hidden piece of candy. “What is it?” Her voice was like a\nwhisper. “You can show me. I won’t tell anyone. Is it a treasure? Have you\ncut off a piece of the night’s cloak and tucked it away? Is it the heart of a\nbeetle, so tiny yet powerful?”\nHe said nothing, causing the spren to pout. She floated up, hovering\nthough she had no wings, and looked him in the eyes. “Kaladin, why must\nyou ignore me?”\nKaladin started. “What did you say?”\nShe smiled mischievously, then sprang away, her figure blurring into a\nlong white ribbon of blue-white light. She shot between the bars—twisting\nand warping in the air, like a strip of cloth caught in the wind—and darted\nbeneath the wagon.\n“Storm you!” Kaladin said, leaping to his feet. “Spirit! What did you\nsay? Repeat that!” Spren didn’t use people’s names. Spren weren’t\nintelligent. The larger ones—like windspren or riverspren—could mimic\nvoices and expressions, but they didn’t actually think. They didn’t…\n“Did any of you hear that?” Kaladin asked, turning to the cage’s other\noccupants. The roof was just high enough to let Kaladin stand. The others\nwere lying back, waiting to get their ladle of water. He got no response\nbeyond a few mutters to be quiet and some coughs from the sick man in the\ncorner. Even Kaladin’s “friend” from earlier ignored him. The man had\nfallen into a stupor, staring at his feet, wiggling his toes periodically.\nMaybe they hadn’t seen the spren. Many of the larger ones were\ninvisible except to the person they were tormenting. Kaladin sat back down\nto floor of the wagon, hanging his legs outside. The windspren had said his\nname, but undoubtedly she’d just repeated what she’d heard before. But…\nnone of the men in the cage knew his name."

His grip had cracked and\nbroken the leaves. He’d need to tuck them away to prevent further—\n“Those leaves look interesting,” said that same feminine voice. “You\nlike them a lot, don’t you?”\nKaladin jumped, twisting to the side. The windspren stood in the air\njust beside his head, white dress rippling in a wind Kaladin couldn’t feel.\n“How do you know my name?” he demanded.\nThe windspren didn’t answer. She walked on air over to the bars, then\npoked her head out, watching Tvlakv the slaver administer drinks to the last\nfew slaves in the first wagon. She looked back at Kaladin. “Why don’t you\nfight? You did before. Now you’ve stopped.”\n“Why do you care, spirit?”\nShe cocked her head. “I don’t know,” she said, as if surprised at\nherself. “But I do. Isn’t that odd?”\nIt was more than odd. What did he make of a spren that not only used\nhis name, but seemed to remember things he had done weeks ago?\n“People don’t eat leaves, you know, Kaladin,” she said, folding\ntranslucent arms. Then she cocked her head. “Or do you? I can’t remember.\nYou’re so strange, stuffing some things into your mouths, leaking out other\nthings when you don’t think anyone is looking.”\n“How do you know my name?” he whispered.\n“How do you know it?”\n“I know it because…because it’s mine. My parents told it to me. I\ndon’t know.”\n“Well I don’t either,” she said, nodding as if she’d just won some\ngrand argument.\n“Fine,” he said. “But why are you using my name?”\n“Because it’s polite. And you are impolite.”\n“Spren don’t know what that means!”\n“See, there,” she said, pointing at him. “Impolite.”\nKaladin blinked. Well, he was far from where he’d grown up, walking\nforeign stone and eating foreign food. Perhaps the spren who lived here\nwere different from those back home.\n“So why don’t you fight?” she asked, flitting down to rest on his legs,\nlooking up at his face. She had no weight that he could feel.\n“I can’t fight,” he said softly.\n“You did before.”\nHe closed his eyes and rested his head forward against the bars. “I’m\nso tired.” He didn’t mean the physical fatigue, though eight months eating\nleftovers had stolen much of the lean strength he’d cultivated while at war.\nHe felt tired. Even when he got enough sleep. Even on those rare days when\nhe wasn’t hungry, cold, or stiff from a beating. So tired…\n“You have been tired before.”\n“I’ve failed, spirit,” he replied, squeezing his eyes shut. “Must you\ntorment me so?”\nThey were all dead. Cenn and Dallet, and before that Tukks and the"

Was he mad? Perhaps he should wish for that—madness\nwas an escape from the pain. Instead, it terrified him.\nHe opened his eyes. Tvlakv was finally waddling up to Kaladin’s\nwagon with his bucket of water. The portly, brown-eyed man walked with a\nvery faint limp; the result of a broken leg, perhaps. He was Thaylen, and all\nThaylen men had the same stark white beards—regardless of their age or\nthe color of the hair on their heads—and white eyebrows. Those eyebrows\ngrew very long, and the Thaylen wore them pushed back over the ears. That\nmade him appear to have two white streaks in his otherwise black hair.\nHis clothing—striped trousers of black and red with a dark blue\nsweater that matched the color of his knit cap—had once been fine, but it\nwas now growing ragged. Had he once been something other than a slaver?\nThis life—the casual buying and selling of human flesh—seemed to have an\neffect on men. It wearied the soul, even if it did fill one’s money pouch.\nTvlakv kept his distance from Kaladin, carrying his oil lantern over to\ninspect the coughing slave at the front of the cage. Tvlakv called to his\nmercenaries. Bluth—Kaladin didn’t know why he’d bothered to learn their\nnames—wandered over. Tvlakv spoke quietly, pointing at the slave. Bluth\nnodded, slablike face shadowed in the lanternlight, and pulled the cudgel\nfree from his belt.\nThe windspren took the form of a white ribbon, then zipped over\ntoward the sick man. She spun and twisted a few times before landing on\nthe floor, becoming a girl again. She leaned in to inspect the man. Like a\ncurious child.\nKaladin turned away and closed his eyes, but he could still hear the\ncoughing. Inside his mind, his father’s voice responded. To cure the\ngrinding coughs, said the careful, precise tone, administer two handfuls of\nbloodivy, crushed to a powder, each day. If you don’t have that, be certain\nto give the patient plenty of liquids, preferably with sugar stirred in. As long\nas the patient stays hydrated, he will most likely survive. The disease\nsounds far worse than it is.\nMost likely survive…\nThose coughs continued. Someone unlatched the cage door. Would\nthey know how to help the man? Such an easy solution. Give him water,\nand he would live.\nIt didn’t matter. Best not to get involved.\nMen dying on the battlefield. A youthful face, so familiar and dear,\nlooking to Kaladin for salvation.

Tvlakv shied behind the mercenary,\nusing him as cover.\nKaladin took a deep breath, closing his hand around the leaves and\nthen raising the other to his head, wiping away a smear of blood. He\ncrossed the small cage, bare feet thumping on the wood. Bluth glared as\nKaladin knelt beside the sick man. The flickering light illuminated a long,\ndrawn face and nearly bloodless lips. The man had coughed up phlegm; it\nwas greenish and solid. Kaladin felt the man’s neck for swelling, then\nchecked his dark brown eyes.\n“It’s called the grinding coughs,” Kaladin said. “He will live, if you\ngive him an extra ladle of water every two hours for five days or so. You’ll\nhave to force it down his throat. Mix in sugar, if you have any.”\nBluth scratched at his ample chin, then glanced at the shorter slaver.\n“Pull him out,” Tvlakv said.\nThe wounded slave awoke as Bluth unlocked the cage. The mercenary\nwaved Kaladin back with his cudgel, and Kaladin reluctantly withdrew.\nAfter putting away his cudgel, Bluth grabbed the slave under the arms and\ndragged him out, all the while trying to keep a nervous eye on Kaladin.\nKaladin’s last failed escape attempt had involved twenty armed slaves. His\nmaster should have executed him for that, but he had claimed Kaladin was\n“intriguing” and branded him with shash, then sold him for a pittance.\nThere always seemed to be a reason Kaladin survived when those he’d\ntried to help died. Some men might have seen that as a blessing, but he saw\nit as an ironic kind of torment. He’d spent some time under his previous\nmaster speaking with a slave from the West, a Selay man who had spoken\nof the Old Magic from their legends and its ability to curse people. Could\nthat be what was happening to Kaladin?\nDon’t be foolish, he told himself.\nThe cage door snapped back in place, locking. The cages were\nnecessary—Tvlakv had to protect his fragile investment from the\nhighstorms. The cages had wooden sides that could be pulled up and locked\ninto place during the furious gales.\nBluth dragged the slave over to the fire, beside the unpacked water\nbarrel. Kaladin felt himself relax. There, he told himself. Perhaps you can\nstill help. Perhaps there’s a reason to care.\nKaladin opened his hand and looked down at the crumbled black\nleaves in his palm. He didn’t need these. Sneaking them into Tvlakv’s drink\nwould not only be difficult, but pointless. Did he really want the slaver\ndead? What would that accomplish?\nA low crack rang in the air, followed by a second one, duller, like\nsomeone dropping a bag of grain. Kaladin snapped his head up, looking to"

        "text": "dead? What would that accomplish?\nA low crack rang in the air, followed by a second one, duller, like\nsomeone dropping a bag of grain. Kaladin snapped his head up, looking to\nwhere Bluth had deposited the sick slave. The mercenary raised his cudgel\none more time, then snapped it down, the weapon making a cracking sound\nas it hit the slave’s skull.\nThe slave hadn’t uttered a cry of pain or protest. His corpse slumped\nover in the darkness; Bluth casually picked it up and slung it over his\nshoulder.\n“No!” Kaladin yelled, leaping across the cage and slamming his hands\nagainst the bars.\nTvlakv stood warming himself by the fire.\n“Storm you!” Kaladin screamed. “He could have lived, you bastard!”\nTvlakv glanced at him. Then, leisurely, the slaver walked over,\nstraightening his deep blue knit cap. “He would have gotten you all sick,\nyou see.” His voice was lightly accented, smashing words together, not\ngiving the proper syllables emphasis. Thaylens always sounded to Kaladin\nlike they were mumbling. “I would not lose an entire wagon for one man.”\n“He’s past the spreading stage!” Kaladin said, slamming his hands\nagainst the bars again. “If any of us were going to catch it, we’d have done\nso by now.”\n“Hope that you don’t. I think he was past saving.”\n“I told you otherwise!”\n“And I should believe you, deserter?” Tvlakv said, amused. “A man\nwith eyes that smolder and hate? You would kill me.” He shrugged. “I care\nnot. So long as you are strong when it is time for sales. You should bless me\nfor saving you from that man’s sickness.”\n“I’ll bless your cairn when I pile it up myself,” Kaladin replied.\nTvlakv smiled, walking back toward the fire. “Keep that fury, deserter,\nand that strength. It will pay me well on our arrival.”\nNot if you don’t live that long, Kaladin thought. Tvlakv always warmed\nthe last of the water from the bucket he used for the slaves. He’d make\nhimself tea from it, hanging it over the fire. If Kaladin made sure he was\nwatered last, then powdered the leaves and dropped them into the—\nKaladin froze, then looked down at his hands. In his haste, he’d\nforgotten that he’d been holding the blackbane. He’d dropped the flakes as\nhe slammed his hands against the bars. Only a few bits stuck to his palms,\nnot enough to be potent.\nHe spun to look backward; the floor of the cage was dirty and covered\nwith grime. If the flakes had fallen there, there was no way to collect them.\nThe wind gathered suddenly, blowing dust, crumbs, and dirt out of the\nwagon and into the night.\nEven in this, Kaladin failed.\nHe sank down, his back to the bars, and bowed his head. Defeated.\nThat cursed windspren kept darting around him, looking confused.\n“A man stood on a cliffside and watched his homeland fall into dust.\nThe waters surged beneath, so far beneath. And he heard a child\ncrying. They were his own tears.”"

They were his own tears.”\n—Collected on the 4th of Tanates, year 1171, thirty seconds before\ndeath. Subject was a cobbler of some renown.\nKharbranth, City of Bells, was not a place that Shallan had ever imagined\nshe would visit. Though she’d often dreamed of traveling, she’d expected to\nspend her early life sequestered in her family’s manor, only escaping\nthrough the books of her father’s library. She’d expected to marry one of\nher father’s allies, then spend the rest of her life sequestered in his manor.\nBut expectations were like fine pottery. The harder you held them, the\nmore likely they were to crack.\nShe found herself breathless, clutching her leather-bound drawing pad\nto her chest as longshoremen pulled the ship into the dock. Kharbranth was\nenormous. Built up the side of a steep incline, the city was wedge-shaped,\nas if it were built into a wide crack, with the open side toward the ocean.\nThe buildings were blocky, with square windows, and appeared to have\nbeen constructed of some kind of mud or daub. Crem, perhaps? They were\npainted bright colors, reds and oranges most often, but occasional blues and\nyellows too.\nShe could hear the bells already, tinkling in the wind, ringing with pure\nvoices. She had to strain her neck to look up toward the city’s loftiest rim;\nKharbranth was like a mountain towering over her. How many people lived\nin a place like this? Thousands? Tens of thousands? She shivered again—\ndaunted yet excited—then blinked pointedly, fixing the image of the city in\nher memory.\nSailors rushed about. The Wind’s pleasure was a narrow, single-masted\nvessel, barely large enough for her, the captain, his wife, and the half-dozen\ncrew. It had seemed so small at first, but Captain Tozbek was a calm and\ncautious man, an excellent sailor, even if he was a pagan. He’d guided the\nship with care along the coast, always finding a sheltered cove to ride out\nhighstorms.\nThe captain oversaw the work as the men secured the mooring. Tozbek\nwas a short man, even-shouldered with Shallan, and he wore his long white\nThaylen eyebrows up in a curious spiked pattern. It was like he had two\nwaving fans above his eyes, a foot long each. He wore a simple knit cap and\na silver-buttoned black coat. She’d imagined him getting that scar on his\njaw in a furious sea battle with pirates. The day before, she’d been\ndisappointed to hear it had been caused by loose tackle during rough\nweather.\nHis wife, Ashlv, was already walking down the gangplank to register\ntheir vessel. The captain saw Shallan inspecting him, and so walked over.\nHe was a business connection of her family’s, long trusted by her father.\nThat was good, since the plan she and her brothers had concocted had\ncontained no place for her bringing along a lady-in-waiting or nurse.\nThat plan made Shallan nervous. Very, very nervous. She hated being"

Very, very nervous. She hated being\nduplicitous. But the financial state of her house…They either needed a\nspectacular infusion of wealth or some other edge in local Veden house\npolitics. Otherwise, they wouldn’t last the year.\nFirst things first, Shallan thought, forcing herself to be calm. Find\nJasnah Kholin. Assuming she hasn’t moved off without you again.\n“I’ve sent a lad on your behalf, Brightness,” Tozbek said. “If the\nprincess is still here, we shall soon know.”\nShallan nodded gratefully, still clutching her drawing pad. Out in the\ncity, there were people everywhere. Some wore familiar clothing—trousers\nand shirts that laced up the front for the men, skirts and colorful blouses for\nthe women. Those could have been from her homeland, Jah Keved. But\nKharbranth was a free city. A small, politically fragile city-state, it held little\nterritory but had docks open to all ships that passed, and it asked no\nquestions about nationality or status. People flowed to it.\nThat meant many of the people she saw were exotic. Those single-\nsheet wraps would mark a man or woman from Tashikk, far to the west. The\nlong coats, enveloping down to the ankles, but open in the front like\ncloaks…where were those from? She’d rarely seen so many parshmen as\nshe noted working the docks, carrying cargo on their backs. Like the\nparshmen her father had owned, these were stout and thick of limb, with\ntheir odd marbled skin—some parts pale or black, others a deep crimson.\nThe mottled pattern was unique to each individual.\nAfter chasing Jasnah Kholin from town to town for the better part of\nsix months, Shallan was beginning to think she’d never catch the woman.\nWas the princess avoiding her? No, that didn’t seem likely—Shallan just\nwasn’t important enough to wait for. Brightness Jasnah Kholin was one of\nthe most powerful women in the world. And one of the most infamous. She\nwas the only member of a faithful royal house who was a professed heretic.\nShallan tried not to grow anxious. Most likely, they’d discover that\nJasnah had moved on again. The Wind’s pleasure would dock for the night,\nand Shallan would negotiate a price with the captain—steeply discounted,\nbecause of her family’s investments in Tozbek’s shipping business—to take\nher to the next port.\nAlready, they were months past the time when Tozbek had expected to\nbe rid of her. She’d never sensed resentment from him; his honor and\nloyalty kept him agreeing to her requests. However, his patience wouldn’t\nlast forever, and neither would her money. She’d already used over half the\nspheres she’d brought with her. He wouldn’t abandon her in an unfamiliar\ncity, of course, but he might regretfully insist on taking her back to Vedenar.\n“Captain!” a sailor said, rushing up the gangplank.

        "text": "“Captain!” a sailor said, rushing up the gangplank. He wore only a vest\nand loose, baggy trousers, and had the darkly tanned skin of one who\nworked in the sun. “No message, sir. Dock registrar says that Jasnah hasn’t\nleft yet.”\n“Ha!” the captain said, turning to Shallan. “The hunt is over!”\n“Bless the Heralds,” Shallan said softly.\nThe captain smiled, flamboyant eyebrows looking like streaks of light\ncoming from his eyes. “It must be your beautiful face that brought us this\nfavorable wind! The windspren themselves were entranced by you,\nBrightness Shallan, and led us here!”\nShallan blushed, considering a response that wasn’t particularly proper.\n“Ah!” the captain said, pointing at her. “I can see you have a reply—I\nsee it in your eyes, young miss! Spit it out. Words aren’t meant to be kept\ninside, you see. They are free creatures, and if locked away will unsettle the\nstomach.”\n“It’s not polite,” Shallan protested.\nTozbek bellowed a laugh. “Months of travel, and still you claim that! I\nkeep telling you that we’re sailors! We forgot how to be polite the moment\nwe set first foot on a ship; we’re far beyond redemption now.”\nShe smiled. She’d been trained by stern nurses and tutors to hold her\ntongue—unfortunately, her brothers had been even more determined in\nencouraging her to do the opposite. She’d made a habit of entertaining them\nwith witty comments when nobody else was near. She thought fondly of\nhours spent by the crackling greatroom hearth, the younger three of her four\nbrothers huddled around her, listening as she made sport of their father’s\nnewest sycophant or a traveling ardent. She’d often fabricated silly versions\nof conversations to fill the mouths of people they could see, but not hear.\nThat had established in her what her nurses had referred to as an\n“insolent streak.” And the sailors were even more appreciative of a witty\ncomment than her brothers had been.\n“Well,” Shallan said to the captain, blushing but still eager to speak, “I\nwas just thinking this: You say that my beauty coaxed the winds to deliver\nus to Kharbranth with haste. But wouldn’t that imply that on other trips, my\nlack of beauty was to blame for us arriving late?”\n“Well…er…”\n“So in reality,” Shallan said, “you’re telling me I’m beautiful precisely\none-sixth of the time.”\n“Nonsense! Young miss, you’re like a morning sunrise, you are!”\n“Like a sunrise? By that you mean entirely too crimson”—she pulled\nat her long red hair—“and prone to making men grouchy when they see\nme?”\nHe laughed, and several of the sailors nearby joined in. “All right\nthen,” Captain Tozbek said, “you’re like a flower.”\nShe grimaced. “I’m allergic to flowers.”\nHe raised an eyebrow.\n“No, really,” she admitted. “I think they’re quite captivating. But if\nyou were to give me a bouquet, you’d soon find me in a fit so energetic that\nit would have you searching the walls for stray freckles I might have blown\nfree with the force of my sneezes.”"

Young women should not act in\nsuch an irritable way.”\n“Ah, young miss,” the captain said, tipping his knit cap toward her.\n“The lads and I will miss your clever tongue. I’m not sure what we’ll do\nwithout you.”\n“Sail, likely,” she said. “And eat, and sing, and watch the waves. All\nthe things you do now, only you shall have rather more time to accomplish\nall of it, as you won’t be stumbling across a youthful girl as she sits on your\ndeck sketching and mumbling to herself. But you have my thanks, Captain,\nfor a trip that was wonderful—if somewhat exaggerated in length.”\nHe tipped his cap to her in acknowledgment.\nShallan grinned—she hadn’t expected being out on her own to be so\nliberating. Her brothers had worried that she’d be frightened. They saw her\nas timid because she didn’t like to argue and remained quiet when large\ngroups were talking. And perhaps she was timid—being away from Jah\nKeved was daunting. But it was also wonderful. She’d filled three\nsketchbooks with pictures of the creatures and people she’d seen, and while\nher worry over her house’s finances was a perpetual cloud, it was balanced\nby the sheer delight of experience.\nTozbek began making dock arrangements for his ship. He was a good\nman. As for his praise of her supposed beauty, she took that for what it was.\nA kind, if overstated, mark of affection. She was pale-skinned in an era\nwhen Alethi tan was seen as the mark of true beauty, and though she had\nlight blue eyes, her impure family line was manifest in her auburn-red hair.\nNot a single lock of proper black. Her freckles had faded as she reached\nyoung womanhood—Heralds be blessed—but there were still some visible,\ndusting her cheeks and nose.\n“Young miss,” the captain said to her after conferring with his men,\n“Your Brightness Jasnah, she’ll undoubtedly be at the Conclave, you see.”\n“Oh, where the Palanaeum is?”\n“Yes, yes. And the king lives there too. It’s the center of the city, so to\nspeak. Except it’s on the top.” He scratched his chin. “Well, anyway,\nBrightness Jasnah Kholin is sister to a king; she will stay nowhere else, not\nin Kharbranth. Yalb here will show you the way. We can deliver your trunk\nlater.”\n“Many thanks, Captain,” she said. “Shaylor mkabat nour.” The winds\nhave brought us safely. A phrase of thanks in the Thaylen language.\nThe captain smiled broadly. “Mkai bade fortenthis!”\nShe had no idea what that meant. Her Thaylen was quite good when\nshe was reading, but hearing it spoken was something else entirely. She"

Her Thaylen was quite good when\nshe was reading, but hearing it spoken was something else entirely. She\nsmiled at him, which seemed the proper response, for he laughed, gesturing\nto one of his sailors.\n“We’ll wait here in this dock for two days,” he told her. “There is a\nhighstorm coming tomorrow, you see, so we cannot leave. If the situation\nwith the Brightness Jasnah does not proceed as hoped, we’ll take you back\nto Jah Keved.”\n“Thank you again.”\n“’Tis nothing, young miss,” he said. “Nothing but what we’d be doing\nanyway. We can take on goods here and all. Besides, that’s a right nice\nlikeness of my wife you gave me for my cabin. Right nice.”\nHe strode over to Yalb, giving him instructions. Shallan waited, putting\nher drawing pad back into her leather portfolio. Yalb. The name was\ndifficult for her Veden tongue to pronounce. Why were the Thaylens so fond\nof mashing letters together, without proper vowels?\nYalb waved for her. She moved to follow.\n“Be careful with yourself, lass,” the captain warned as she passed.\n“Even a safe city like Kharbranth hides dangers. Keep your wits about\nyou.”\n“I should think I’d prefer my wits inside my skull, Captain,” she\nreplied, carefully stepping onto the gangplank. “If I keep them ‘about me’\ninstead, then someone has gotten entirely too close to my head with a\ncudgel.”\nThe captain laughed, waving her farewell as she made her way down\nthe gangplank, holding the railing with her freehand. Like all Vorin women,\nshe kept her left hand—her safehand—covered, exposing only her freehand.\nCommon darkeyed women would wear a glove, but a woman of her rank\nwas expected to show more modesty than that. In her case, she kept her\nsafehand covered by the oversized cuff of her left sleeve, which was\nbuttoned closed.\nThe dress was of a traditional Vorin cut, formfitting through the bust,\nshoulders, and waist, with a flowing skirt below. It was blue silk with chull-\nshell buttons up the sides, and she carried her satchel by pressing it to her\nchest with her safehand while holding the railing with her freehand.\nShe stepped off the gangplank into the furious activity of the docks,\nmessengers running this way and that, women in red coats tracking cargos\non ledgers. Kharbranth was a Vorin kingdom, like Alethkar and like\nShallan’s own Jah Keved. They weren’t pagans here, and writing was a\nfeminine art; men learned only glyphs, leaving letters and reading to their\nwives and sisters.\nShe hadn’t asked, but she was certain Captain Tozbek could read.\nShe’d seen him holding books; it had made her uncomfortable. Reading\nwas an unseemly trait in a man. At least, men who weren’t ardents.\n“You wanna ride?” Yalb asked her, his rural Thaylen dialect so thick\nshe could barely make out the words.\n“Yes, please.”"

        "text": "“You wanna ride?” Yalb asked her, his rural Thaylen dialect so thick\nshe could barely make out the words.\n“Yes, please.”\nHe nodded and rushed off, leaving her on the docks, surrounded by a\ngroup of parshmen who were laboriously moving wooden crates from one\npier to another. Parshmen were thick-witted, but they made excellent\nworkers. Never complaining, always doing as they were told. Her father\nhad preferred them to regular slaves.\nWere the Alethi really fighting parshmen out on the Shattered Plains?\nThat seemed so odd to Shallan. Parshmen didn’t fight. They were docile and\npractically mute. Of course, from what she’d heard, the ones out on the\nShattered Plains—the Parshendi, they were called—were physically\ndifferent from regular parshmen. Stronger, taller, keener of mind. Perhaps\nthey weren’t really parshmen at all, but distant relatives of some kind.\nTo her surprise, she could see signs of animal life all around the docks.\nA few skyeels undulated through the air, searching for rats or fish. Tiny\ncrabs hid between cracks in the dock’s boards, and a cluster of haspers\nclung to the dock’s thick logs. In a street inland of the docks, a prowling\nmink skulked in the shadows, watching for morsels that might be dropped.\nShe couldn’t resist pulling open her portfolio and beginning a sketch of\na pouncing skyeel. Wasn’t it afraid of all the people? She held her\nsketchpad with her safehand, hidden fingers wrapping around the top as she\nused a charcoal pencil to draw. Before she was finished, her guide returned\nwith a man pulling a curious contraption with two large wheels and a\ncanopy-covered seat. She hesitantly lowered her sketchpad. She’d expected\na palanquin.\nThe man pulling the machine was short and dark-skinned, with a wide\nsmile and full lips. He gestured for Shallan to sit, and she did so with the\nmodest grace her nurses had drilled into her. The driver asked her a question\nin a clipped, terse-sounding language she didn’t recognize.\n“What was that?” she asked Yalb.\n“He wants to know if you’d like to be pulled the long way or the short\nway.” Yalb scratched his head. “I’m not right sure what the difference is.”\n“I suspect one takes longer,” Shallan said.\n“Oh, you are a clever one.” Yalb said something to the porter in that\nsame clipped language, and the man responded.\n“The long way gives a good view of the city,” Yalb said. “The short\nway goes straight up to the Conclave. Not many good views, he says. I\nguess he noticed you were new to the city.”\n“Do I stand out that much?” Shallan asked, flushing.\n“Eh, no, of course not, Brightness.”\n“And by that you mean that I’m as obvious as a wart on a queen’s\nnose.”\nYalb laughed. “Afraid so. But you can’t go someplace a second time\nuntil you been there a first time, I reckon. Everyone has to stand out\nsometime, so you might as well do it in a pretty way like yourself!”"

        "text": "until you been there a first time, I reckon. Everyone has to stand out\nsometime, so you might as well do it in a pretty way like yourself!”\nShe’d had to get used to gentle flirtation from the sailors. They were\nnever too forward, and she suspected the captain’s wife had spoken to them\nsternly when she’d noticed how it made Shallan blush. Back at her father’s\nmanor, servants—even those who had been full citizens—had been afraid to\nstep out of their places.\nThe porter was still waiting for an answer. “The short way, please,” she\ntold Yalb, though she longed to take the scenic path. She was finally in a\nreal city and she took the direct route? But Brightness Jasnah had proven to\nbe as elusive as a wild songling. Best to be quick.\nThe main roadway cut up the hillside in switchbacks, and so even the\nshort way gave her time to see much of the city. It proved intoxicatingly\nrich with strange people, sights, and ringing bells. Shallan sat back and took\nit all in. Buildings were grouped by color, and that color seemed to indicate\npurpose. Shops selling the same items would be painted the same shades—\nviolet for clothing, green for foods. Homes had their own pattern, though\nShallan couldn’t interpret it. The colors were soft, with a washed-out,\nsubdued tonality.\nYalb walked alongside her cart, and the porter began to talk back\ntoward her. Yalb translated, hands in the pockets of his vest. “He says that\nthe city is special because of the lait here.”\nShallan nodded. Many cities were built in laits—areas protected from\nthe highstorms by nearby rock formations.\n“Kharbranth is one of the most sheltered major cities in the world,”\nYalb continued, translating, “and the bells are a symbol of that. It’s said\nthey were first erected to warn that a highstorm was blowing, since the\nwinds were so soft that people didn’t always notice.” Yalb hesitated. “He’s\njust saying things because he wants a big tip, Brightness. I’ve heard that\nstory, but I think it’s blustering ridiculous. If the winds blew strong enough\nto move bells, then people’d notice. Besides, people didn’t notice it was\nraining on their blustering heads?”\nShallan smiled. “It’s all right. He can continue.”\nThe porter chatted on in his clipped voice—what language was that,\nanyway? Shallan listened to Yalb’s translation, drinking in the sights,\nsounds, and—unfortunately—scents. She’d grown up accustomed to the\ncrisp smell of freshly dusted furniture and flatbread baking in the kitchens.\nHer ocean journey had taught her new scents, of brine and clean sea air.\nThere was nothing clean in what she smelled here. Each passing\nalleyway had its own unique array of revolting stenches. These alternated\nwith the spicy scents of street vendors and their foods, and the juxtaposition\nwas even more nauseating. Fortunately, her porter moved into the central\npart of the roadway, and the stenches abated, though it did slow them as\nthey had to contend with thicker traffic. She gawked at those they passed."

She gawked at those they passed.\nThose men with gloved hands and faintly bluish skin were from Natanatan.\nBut who were those tall, stately people dressed in robes of black? And the\nmen with their beards bound in cords, making them rodlike?\nThe sounds put Shallan in mind of the competing choruses of wild\nsonglings near her home, only multiplied in variety and volume. A hundred\nvoices called to one another, mingling with doors slamming, wheels rolling\non stone, occasional skyeels crying. The ever-present bells tinkled in the\nbackground, louder when the wind blew. They were displayed in the\nwindows of shops, hung from rafters. Each lantern pole along the street had\na bell hung under the lamp, and her cart had a small silvery one at the very\ntip of its canopy. When she was about halfway up the hillside, a rolling\nwave of loud clock bells rang the hour. The varied, unsynchronized chimes\nmade a clangorous din.\nThe crowds thinned as they reached the upper quarter of the city, and\neventually her porter pulled her to a massive building at the very apex of\nthe city. Painted white, it was carved from the rock face itself, rather than\nbuilt of bricks or clay. The pillars out front grew seamlessly from the stone,\nand the back side of the building melded smoothly into the cliff. The\noutcroppings of roof had squat domes atop them, and were painted in\nmetallic colors. Lighteyed women passed in and out, carrying scribing\nutensils and wearing dresses like Shallan’s, their left hands properly cuff ed.\nThe men entering or leaving the building wore military-style Vorin coats\nand stiff trousers, buttons up the sides and ending in a stiff collar that\nwrapped the entire neck. Many carried swords at their waists, the belts\nwrapping around the knee-length coats.\nThe porter stopped and made a comment to Yalb. The sailor began\narguing with him, hands on hips. Shallan smiled at his stern expression, and\nshe blinked pointedly, affixing the scene in her memory for later sketching.\n“He’s offering to split the difference with me if I let him inflate the\nprice of the trip,” Yalb said, shaking his head and offering a hand to help\nShallan from the cart. She stepped down, looking at the porter, who\nshrugged, smiling like a child who had been caught sneaking sweets.\nShe clutched her satchel with her cuff ed arm, searching through it\nwith her freehand for her money pouch. “How much should I actually give\nhim?”\n“Two clearchips should be more than enough.

Emeralds were the most valuable, for they\ncould be used by Soulcasters to create food.\nThe glass part of most spheres was the same size; the size of the\ngemstone at the center determined the denomination. The three chips, for\ninstance, each had only a tiny splinter of diamond inside. Even that was\nenough to glow with Stormlight, far fainter than a lamp, but still visible. A\nmark—the medium denomination of sphere—was a little less bright than a\ncandle, and it took five chips to make a mark.\nShe’d brought only infused spheres, as she’d heard that dun ones were\nconsidered suspect, and sometimes a moneylender would have to be\nbrought in to judge the authenticity of the gemstone. She kept the most\nvaluable spheres she had in her safepouch, of course, which was buttoned to\nthe inside of her left sleeve.\nShe handed the three chips to Yalb, who cocked his head. She nodded\nat the porter, blushing, realizing that she’d reflexively used Yalb like a\nmaster-servant intermediary. Would he be offended?\nHe laughed and stood up stiffly, as if imitating a master-servant,\npaying the porter with a mock stern expression. The porter laughed, bowed\nto Shallan, then pulled his cart away.\n“This is for you,” Shallan said, taking out a ruby mark and handing it\nto Yalb.\n“Brightness, this is too much!”\n“It’s partially out of thanks,” she said, “but is also to pay you to stay\nhere and wait for a few hours, in case I return.”\n“Wait a few hours for a firemark? That’s wages for a week’s sailing!”\n“Then it should be enough to make certain you don’t wander off.”\n“I’ll be right here!” Yalb said, giving her an elaborate bow that was\nsurprisingly well-executed.\nShallan took a deep breath and strode up the steps toward the\nConclave’s imposing entrance. The carved rock really was remarkable—the\nartist in her wanted to linger and study it, but she didn’t dare. Entering the\nlarge building was like being swallowed. The hallway inside was lined with\nStormlight lamps that shone with white light. Diamond broams were\nprobably set inside them; most buildings of fine construction used\nStormlight to provide illumination. A broam—the highest denomination of\nsphere—glowed with about the same light as several candles.\nTheir light shone evenly and softly on the many attendants, scribes,\nand lighteyes moving through the hallway. The building appeared to be\nconstructed as one broad, high, and long tunnel, burrowed into the rock.\nGrand chambers lined the sides, and subsidiary corridors branched off the\ncentral grand promenade. She felt far more comfortable than she had\noutdoors. This place—with its bustling servants, its lesser brightlords and\nbrightladies—was familiar.\nShe raised her freehand in a sign of need, and sure enough, a master-\nservant in a crisp white shirt and black trousers hurried over to her.\n“Brightness?” he asked, speaking her native Veden, likely because of the\ncolor of her hair.\n“I seek Jasnah Kholin,” Shallan said. “I have word that she is within"

        "text": "“Brightness?” he asked, speaking her native Veden, likely because of the\ncolor of her hair.\n“I seek Jasnah Kholin,” Shallan said. “I have word that she is within\nthese walls.”\nThe master-servant bowed crisply. Most master-servants prided\nthemselves on their refined service—the very same air that Yalb had been\nmocking moments ago. “I shall return, Brightness.” He would be of the\nsecond nahn, a darkeyed citizen of very high rank. In Vorin belief, one’s\nCalling—the task to which one dedicated one’s life—was of vital\nimportance. Choosing a good profession and working hard at it was the best\nway to ensure good placement in the afterlife. The specific devotary that\none visited for worship often had to do with the nature of one’s chosen\nCalling.\nShallan folded her arms, waiting. She had thought long about her own\nCalling. The obvious choice was her art, and she did so love sketching. But\nit was more than just the drawing that attracted her—it was the study, the\nquestions raised by observation. Why weren’t the skyeels afraid of people?\nWhat did haspers feed on? Why did a rat population thrive in one area, but\nfail in another? So she’d chosen natural history instead.\nShe longed to be a true scholar, to receive real instruction, to spend\ntime on deep research and study. Was that part of why she’d suggested this\ndaring plan of seeking out Jasnah and becoming her ward? Perhaps.\nHowever, she needed to remain focused. Becoming Jasnah’s ward—and\ntherefore student—was only one step.\nShe considered this as she idly walked up to a pillar, using her\nfreehand to feel the polished stone. Like much of Roshar—save for certain\ncoastal regions—Kharbranth was built on raw, unbroken stone. The\nbuildings outside had been set directly on the rock, and this one sliced into\nit. The pillar was granite, she guessed, though her geological knowledge\nwas sketchy.\nThe floor was covered with long, burnt-orange rugs. The material was\ndense, designed to look rich but bear heavy traffic. The broad, rectangular\nhallway had an old feel to it. One book she’d read claimed that Kharbranth\nhad been founded way back into the shadowdays, years before the Last\nDesolation. That would make it old indeed. Thousands of years old, created\nbefore the terrors of the Hierocracy, long before—even—the Recreance.\nBack when Voidbringers with bodies of stone were said to have stalked the\nland.\n“Brightness?” a voice asked.\nShallan turned to find that the servant had returned.\n“This way, Brightness.”\nShe nodded to the servant, and he led her quickly down the busy\nhallway. She went over how to present herself to Jasnah. The woman was a\nlegend. Even Shallan—living in the remote estates of Jah Keved—had\nheard of the Alethi king’s brilliant, heretic sister. Jasnah was only thirty-four\nyears old, yet many felt she would already have obtained the cap of a\nmaster scholar if it weren’t for her vocal denunciations of religion. Most\nspecifically, she denounced the devotaries, the various religious\ncongregations that proper Vorin people joined."

Most\nspecifically, she denounced the devotaries, the various religious\ncongregations that proper Vorin people joined.\nImproper quips would not serve Shallan well here. She would have to\nbe proper. Wardship to a woman of great renown was the best way to be\nschooled in the feminine arts: music, painting, writing, logic, and science. It\nwas much like how a young man would train in the honor guard of a\nbrightlord he respected.\nShallan had originally written to Jasnah requesting a wardship in\ndesperation; she hadn’t actually expected the woman to reply in the\naffirmative. When she had—via a letter commanding Shallan to attend her\nin Dumadari in two weeks—Shallan had been shocked. She’d been chasing\nthe woman ever since.\nJasnah was a heretic. Would she demand that Shallan renounce her\nfaith? She doubted she could do such a thing. Vorin teachings regarding\none’s Glory and Calling had been one of her few refuges during the difficult\ndays, when her father had been at his worst.\nThey turned into a narrower hallway, entering corridors increasingly\nfar from the main cavern. Finally, the master-servant stopped at a corner\nand gestured for Shallan to continue. There were voices coming from the\ncorridor to the right.\nShallan hesitated. Sometimes, she wondered how it had come to this.\nShe was the quiet one, the timid one, the youngest of five siblings and the\nonly girl. Sheltered, protected all her life. And now the hopes of her entire\nhouse rested on her shoulders.\nTheir father was dead. And it was vital that remain a secret.\nShe didn’t like to think of that day—she all but blocked it from her\nmind, and trained herself to think of other things. But the effects of his loss\ncould not be ignored. He had made many promises—some business deals,\nsome bribes, some of the latter disguised as the former. House Davar owed\ngreat amounts of money to a great number of people, and without her father\nto keep them all appeased, the creditors would soon begin making demands.\nThere was nobody to turn to. Her family, mostly because of her father,\nwas loathed even by its allies. Highprince Valam—the brightlord to whom\nher family gave fealty—was ailing, and no longer offered them the\nprotection he once had. When it became known that her father was dead and\nher family bankrupt, that would be the end of House Davar. They’d be\nconsumed and subjugated to another house.\nThey’d be worked to the bone as punishment—in fact, they might even\nface assassination by disgruntled creditors. Preventing that depended on\nShallan, and the first step came with Jasnah Kholin.\nShallan took a deep breath, then strode around the corner.\n“I’m dying, aren’t I? Healer, why do you take my blood? Who is that\nbeside you, with his head of lines? I can see a distant sun, dark and\ncold, shining in a black sky.”\n—Collected on the 3rd of Jesnan, 1172, 11 seconds pre-death.

Sample is of particular note.\n“Why don’t you cry?” the windspren asked.\nKaladin sat with his back to the corner of the cage, looking down. The\nfloor planks in front of him were splintered, as if someone had dug at them\nwith nothing but his fingernails. The splintered section was stained dark\nwhere the dry grey wood had soaked up blood. A futile, delusional attempt\nat escape.\nThe wagon continued to roll. The same routine each day. Wake up sore\nand aching from a fitful night spent without mattress or blanket. One wagon\nat a time, the slaves were let out and hobbled with leg irons and given time\nto shuffle around and relieve themselves. Then they were packed away and\ngiven morning slop, and the wagons rolled until afternoon slop. More\nrolling. Evening slop, then a ladle of water before sleep.\nKaladin’s shash brand was still cracked and bleeding. At least the\ncage’s top gave shade from the sun.\nThe windspren shifted to mist, floating like a tiny cloud. She moved in\nclose to Kaladin, the motion outlining her face at the front of the cloud, as if\nblowing back the fog and revealing something more substantial underneath.\nVaporous, feminine, and angular. With such curious eyes. Like no other\nspren he’d seen.\n“The others cry at night,” she said. “But you don’t.”\n“Why cry?” he said, leaning his head back against the bars. “What\nwould it change?”\n“I don’t know. Why do men cry?”\nHe smiled, closing his eyes. “Ask the Almighty why men cry, little\nspren. Not me.” His forehead dripped with sweat from the Eastern summer\nhumidity, and it stung as it seeped into his wound. Hopefully, they’d have\nsome weeks of spring again soon. Weather and seasons were unpredictable.\nYou never knew how long they would go on, though typically each would\nlast a few weeks.\nThe wagon rolled on. After a time, he felt sunlight on his face. He\nopened his eyes. The sun shone in through the upper side of the cage. Two\nor three hours past noon, then. What of afternoon slop? Kaladin stood,\npulling himself up with one hand on the steel bars. He couldn’t make out\nTvlakv driving the wagon up ahead, only flat-faced Bluth behind. The\nmercenary had on a dirty shirt that laced up the front and wore a wide-\nbrimmed hat against the sun, his spear and cudgel riding on the wagon\nbench beside him. He didn’t carry a sword—not even Tvlakv did that, not\nnear Alethi land.\nThe grass continued to part for the wagons, vanishing just in front,\nthen creeping out after the wagons passed. The landscape here was dotted\nwith strange shrubs that Kaladin didn’t recognize. They had thick stalks and\nstems and spiny green needles. Whenever the wagons grew too close, the\nneedles pulled into the stalks, leaving behind twisted, wormlike trunks with\nknotted branches. They dotted the hilly landscape, rising from the grass-"

They dotted the hilly landscape, rising from the grass-\ncovered rocks like diminutive sentries.\nThe wagons just kept on going, well past noon. Why aren’t we stopping\nfor slop?\nThe lead wagon finally pulled to a stop. The other two lurched to a halt\nbehind it, the red-carapaced chulls fidgeted, their antennae waving back and\nforth. The box-shaped animals had bulging, stony shells and thick, trunklike\nred legs. From what Kaladin had heard, their claws could snap a man’s arm.\nBut chulls were docile, particularly domesticated ones, and he’d never\nknown anyone in the army to get more than a halfhearted pinch from one.\nBluth and Tag climbed down from their wagons and walked up to meet\nTvlakv. The slavemaster stood on his wagon’s seat, shading his eyes against\nthe white sunlight and holding a sheet of paper in his hand. An argument\nensued. Tvlakv kept waving in the direction they had been going, then\npointing at his sheet of paper.\n“Lost, Tvlakv?” Kaladin called. “Perhaps you should pray to the\nAlmighty for guidance. I hear he has a fondness for slavers. Keeps a special\nroom in Damnation just for you.”\nTo Kaladin’s left, one of the slaves—the long-bearded man who had\ntalked to him a few days back—sidled away, not wanting to stand close to a\nperson who was provoking the slaver.\nTvlakv hesitated, then waved curtly to his mercenaries, silencing them.\nThe portly man hopped down from his wagon and walked over to Kaladin.\n“You,” he said. “Deserter. Alethi armies travel these lands for their war. Do\nyou know anything of the area?”\n“Let me see the map,” Kaladin said. Tvlakv hesitated, then held it up\nfor Kaladin.\nKaladin reached through the bars and snatched the paper. Then,\nwithout reading it, Kaladin ripped it in two. In seconds he’d shredded it into\na hundred pieces in front of Tvlakv’s horrified eyes.\nTvlakv called for the mercenaries, but by the time they arrived,\nKaladin had a double handful of confetti to toss out at them. “Happy\nMiddlefest, you bastards,” Kaladin said as the flakes of paper fluttered\naround them. He turned and walked to the other side of the cage and sat\ndown, facing them.\nTvlakv stood, speechless. Then, red faced, he pointed at Kaladin and\nhissed something at the mercenaries. Bluth took a step toward the cage, but\nthen thought better of it. He glanced at Tvlakv, then shrugged and walked\naway. Tvlakv turned to Tag, but the other mercenary just shook his head,\nsaying something soft.\nAfter a few minutes of stewing at the cowardly mercenaries, Tvlakv\nrounded the cage and approached where Kaladin was sitting. Surprisingly,\nwhen he spoke, his voice was calm. “I see you are clever, deserter. You have\nmade yourself invaluable. My other slaves, they aren’t from this area, and I"

I can promise you an extra meal each day, should\nyou please me.”\n“You want me to lead the caravan?”\n“Instructions will be acceptable.”\n“All right. First, find a cliff.”\n“That, it will give you a vantage to see the area?”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “It will give me something to throw you off of.”\nTvlakv adjusted his cap in annoyance, brushing back one of his long\nwhite eyebrows. “You hate me. That is good. Hatred will keep you strong,\nmake you sell for much. But you will not find vengeance on me unless I\nhave a chance to take you to market. I will not let you escape. But perhaps\nsomeone else would. You want to be sold, you see?”\n“I don’t want vengeance,” Kaladin said. The windspren came back—\nshe’d darted off for a time to inspect one of the strange shrubs. She landed\nin the air and began walking around Tvlakv’s face, inspecting him. He\ndidn’t seem to be able to see her.\nTvlakv frowned. “No vengeance?”\n“It doesn’t work,” Kaladin said. “I learned that lesson long ago.”\n“Long ago? You cannot be older than eighteen years, deserter.”\nIt was a good guess. He was nineteen. Had it really only been four\nyears since he’d joined Amaram’s army? Kaladin felt as if he’d aged a\ndozen.\n“You are young,” Tvlakv continued. “You could escape this fate of\nyours. Men have been known to live beyond the slave’s brand—you could\npay off your slave price, you see? Or convince one of your masters to give\nyou your freedom. You could become a free man again. It is not so\nunlikely.”\nKaladin snorted. “I’ll never be free of these brands, Tvlakv. You must\nknow that I’ve tried—and failed—to escape ten times over. It’s more than\nthese glyphs on my head that makes your mercenaries wary.”\n“Past failure does not prove that there is not chance in the future, yes?”\n“I’m finished. I don’t care.” He eyed the slaver. “Besides, you don’t\nactually believe what you’re saying. I doubt a man like you would be able\nto sleep at night if he thought the slaves he sold would be free to seek him\nout one day.”\nTvlakv laughed. “Perhaps, deserter. Perhaps you are right. Or perhaps I\nsimply think that if you were to get free, you would hunt down the first man\nwho sold you to slavery, you see? Highlord Amaram, was it not? His death\nwould give me warning so I can run.”\nHow had he known? How had he heard about Amaram? I’ll find him,\nKaladin thought. I’ll gut him with my own hands. I’ll twist his head right off\nhis neck, I’ll—\n“Yes,” Tvlakv said, studying Kaladin’s face, “so you were not so\nhonest when you said you do not thirst for vengeance. I see.”"

We must be friends with one\nanother, you see, for nobody else will stomach us.”\n“Then you know that I didn’t get this brand for deserting.”\n“Ah, but it is what we must pretend, you see? Men guilty of high\ncrimes, they do not sell so well. With that shash glyph on your head, it will\nbe difficult enough to get a good price for you. If I cannot sell you, then\nyou…well, you will not wish for that status. So we will play a game\ntogether. I will say you are a deserter. And you will say nothing. It is an\neasy game, I think.”\n“It’s illegal.”\n“We are not in Alethkar,” Tvlakv said, “so there is no law. Besides,\ndesertion was the official reason for your sale. Claim otherwise, and you\nwill gain nothing but a reputation for dishonesty.”\n“Nothing besides a headache for you.”\n“But you just said you have no desire for vengeance against me.”\n“I could learn.”\nTvlakv laughed. “Ah, if you have not learned that already, then you\nprobably never will! Besides, did you not threaten to throw me off a cliff? I\nthink you have learned already. But now, we must discuss how to proceed.\nMy map has met with an untimely demise, you see.”\nKaladin hesitated, then sighed. “I don’t know,” he said honestly. “I’ve\nnever been this way either.”\nTvlakv frowned. He leaned closer to the cage, inspecting Kaladin,\nthough he still kept his distance. After a moment, Tvlakv shook his head. “I\nbelieve you, deserter. A pity. Well, I shall trust my memory. The map was\npoorly rendered anyway. I am almost glad you ripped it, for I was tempted\nto do the same myself. If I should happen across any portraits of my former\nwives, I shall see that they cross your path and take advantage of your\nunique talents.” He strolled away.\nKaladin watched him go, then cursed to himself.\n“What was that for?” the windspren said, walking up to him, head\ncocked.\n“I almost find myself liking him,” Kaladin said, pounding his head\nback against the cage.\n“But…after what he did…”\nKaladin shrugged. “I didn’t say Tvlakv isn’t a bastard. He’s just a\nlikable bastard.” He hesitated, then grimaced. “Those are the worst kind.\nWhen you kill them, you end up feeling guilty for it.”\nThe wagon leaked during highstorms. That wasn’t surprising; Kaladin\nsuspected that Tvlakv had been driven to slaving by ill fortune. He would\nrather be trading other goods, but something—lack of funds, a need to leave\nhis previous environs with haste—had forced him to pick up this least\nreputable of careers."

They could\nbarely stay ahead of their debts. In this case, that meant wagons which\nleaked. The boarded sides were strong enough to withstand highstorm\nwinds, but they weren’t comfortable.\nTvlakv had almost missed getting ready for this highstorm. Apparently,\nthe map Kaladin had torn up had also included a list of highstorm dates\npurchased from a roving stormwarden. The storms could be predicted\nmathematically; Kaladin’s father had made a hobby of it. He’d been able to\npick the right day eight times out of ten.\nThe boards rattled against the cage’s bars as wind buffeted the vehicle,\nshaking it, making it lurch it like a clumsy giant’s plaything. The wood\ngroaned and spurts of icy rainwater sprayed through cracks. Flashes of\nlightning leaked through as well, accompanied by thunder. That was the\nonly light they got.\nOccasionally, light would flash without the thunder. The slaves would\ngroan in terror at this, thinking about the Stormfather, the shades of the Lost\nRadiants, or the Voidbringers—all of which were said to haunt the most\nviolent highstorms. They huddled together on the far side of the wagon,\nsharing warmth. Kaladin left them to it, sitting alone with his back to the\nbars.\nKaladin didn’t fear stories of things that walked the storms. In the\narmy, he’d been forced to weather a highstorm or two beneath the lip of a\nprotective stone overhang or other bit of impromptu shelter. Nobody liked\nto be out during a storm, but sometimes you couldn’t avoid it. The things\nthat walked the storms—perhaps even the Stormfather himself—weren’t\nnearly so deadly as the rocks and branches cast up into the air. In fact, the\nstorm’s initial tempest of water and wind—the stormwall—was the most\ndangerous part. The longer one endured after that, the weaker the storm\ngrew, until the trailing edge was nothing more than sprinkling rain.\nNo, he wasn’t worried about Voidbringers looking for flesh to feast\nupon. He was worried that something would happen to Tvlakv. The\nslavemaster waited out the storm in a cramped wooden enclosure built into\nthe bottom of his wagon. That was ostensibly the safest place in the\ncaravan, but an unlucky twist of fate—a tempest-thrown boulder, the\ncollapse of the wagon—could leave him dead. In that case, Kaladin could\nsee Bluth and Tag running off, leaving everyone in their cages, wooden\nsides locked up. The slaves would die a slow death by starvation and\ndehydration, baking under the sun in these boxes.\nThe storm continued to blow, shaking the wagon. Those winds felt like\nlive things at times. And who was to say they weren’t? Were windspren\nattracted to gusts of wind, or were they the gusts of wind?

The blasts of wind grew more\nlethargic. Lightning stopped flashing, and the maddening drumming of rain\nbecame a quiet tapping instead. Only once during their journey had a wagon\ntoppled during a highstorm. Both it and the slaves inside had survived with\na few dents and bruises.\nThe wooden side to Kaladin’s right shook suddenly, then fell open as\nBluth undid its clasps. The mercenary wore his leather coat against the wet,\nstreams of water falling from the brim of his hat as he exposed the bars—\nand the occupants—to the rain. It was cold, though not as piercingly so as\nduring the height of the storm. It sprayed across Kaladin and the huddled\nslaves. Tvlakv always ordered the wagons uncovered before the rain\nstopped; he said it was the only way to wash away the slaves’ stink.\nBluth slid the wooden side into place beneath the wagon, then opened\nthe other two sides. Only the wall at the front of the wagon—just behind the\ndriver’s seat—couldn’t be brought down.\n“Little early to be taking down the sides, Bluth,” Kaladin said. It\nwasn’t quite the riddens yet—the period near the end of a highstorm when\nthe rain sprinkled softly. This rain was still heavy, the wind still gusting on\noccasion.\n“The master wants you plenty clean today.”\n“Why?” Kaladin asked, rising, water streaming from his ragged brown\nclothing.\nBluth ignored him. Perhaps we’re nearing our destination, Kaladin\nthought as he scanned the landscape.\nOver the last few days, the hills had given way to uneven rock\nformations—places where weathering winds had left behind crumbling\ncliffs and jagged shapes. Grass grew up the rocky sides that saw the most\nsun, and other plants were plentiful in the shade. The time right after a\nhighstorm was when the land was most alive. Rockbud polyps split and sent\nout their vines. Other kinds of vine crept from crevices, licking up water.\nLeaves unfolded from shrubs and trees. Cremlings of all kinds slithered\nthrough puddles, enjoying the banquet. Insects buzzed into the air; larger\ncrustaceans—crabs and leggers—left their hiding places. The very rocks\nseemed to come to life.\nKaladin noted a half-dozen windspren flitting overhead, their\ntranslucent forms chasing after—or perhaps cruising along with—the\nhighstorm’s last gusts. Tiny lights rose around the plants. Lifespren. They\nlooked like motes of glowing green dust or swarms of tiny translucent\ninsects.\nA legger—its hairlike spines lifted to the air to give warning of\nchanges in the wind—climbed along the side of the cart, its long body lined\nwith dozens of pairs of legs. That was familiar enough, but he’d never seen\na legger with such a deep purple carapace. Where was Tvlakv taking the\ncaravan? Those uncultivated hillsides were perfect for farming.

Kaladin settled back as the sky cleared, the highstorm a smudge of\nblackness on the western horizon. The sun brought welcome warmth, and\nthe slaves basked in the light, streams of water dripping from their clothing\nand running out the back of the rocking wagon.\nPresently, a translucent ribbon of light zipped up to Kaladin. He was\ncoming to take the windspren’s presence for granted. She had gone out\nduring the storm, but she’d come back. As always.\n“I saw others of your kind,” Kaladin said idly.\n“Others?” she asked, taking the form of a young woman. She began to\nstep around him in the air, spinning occasionally, dancing to some unheard\nbeat.\n“Windspren,” Kaladin said. “Chasing after the storm. Are you certain\nyou don’t want to go with them?”\nShe glanced westward, longingly. “No,” she finally said, continuing\nher dance. “I like it here.”\nKaladin shrugged. She’d ceased playing as many pranks as she once\nhad, and so he’d stopped letting her presence annoy him.\n“There are others near,” she said. “Others like you.”\n“Slaves?”\n“I don’t know. People. Not the ones here. Other ones.”\n“Where?”\nShe turned a translucent white finger, pointing eastward. “There. Many\nof them. Lots and lots.”\nKaladin stood up. He couldn’t imagine that a spren had a good handle\non how to measure distance and numbers. Yes… Kaladin squinted, studying\nthe horizon. That’s smoke. From chimneys? He caught a gust of it on the\nwind; if not for the rain, he’d probably have smelled it sooner.\nShould he care? It didn’t matter where he was a slave; he’d still be a\nslave. He’d accepted this life. That was his way now. Don’t care, don’t\nbother.\nStill, he watched with curiosity as his wagon climbed the side of a hill\nand gave the slaves inside a good vantage of what was ahead. It wasn’t a\ncity. It was something grander, something larger.

        "text": "“Great Father of Storms…” Kaladin whispered.\nTen masses of troops bivouacked in familiar Alethi patterns—circular,\nby company rank, with camp followers on the outskirts, mercenaries in a\nring just inside them, citizen soldiers near the middle, lighteyed officers at\nthe very center. They were camped in a series of enormous craterlike rock\nformations, only the sides were more irregular, more jagged. Like broken\neggshells.\nKaladin had left an army much like this eight months ago, though\nAmaram’s force had been much smaller. This one covered miles of stone,\nstretching far both north and south. A thousand banners bearing a thousand\ndifferent family glyphpairs flapped proudly in the air. There were some\ntents—mainly on the outside of the armies—but most of the troops were\nhoused in large stone barracks. That meant Soulcasters.\nThat encampment directly ahead of them flew a banner Kaladin had\nseen in books. Deep blue with white glyphs—khokh and linil, stylized and\npainted as a sword standing before a crown. House Kholin. The king’s\nhouse.\nDaunted, Kaladin looked beyond the armies. The landscape to the east\nwas as he’d heard it described in a dozen different stories detailing the\nking’s campaign against the Parshendi betrayers. It was an enormous riven\nplain of rock—so wide he couldn’t see the other side—that was split and\ncut by sheer chasms, crevasses twenty or thirty feet wide. They were so\ndeep that they disappeared into darkness and formed a jagged mosaic of\nuneven plateaus. Some large, others tiny. The expansive plain looked like a\nplatter that had been broken, its pieces then reassembled with small gaps\nbetween the fragments.\n“The Shattered Plains,” Kaladin whispered.\n“What?” the windspren asked. “What’s wrong?”\nKaladin shook his head, bemused. “I spent years trying to get to this\nplace. It’s what Tien wanted, in the end at least. To come here, fight in the\nking’s army…”\nAnd now Kaladin was here. Finally. Accidentally. He felt like laughing\nat the absurdity. I should have realized, he thought. I should have known.\nWe weren’t ever heading toward the coast and its cities. We were heading\nhere. To war.\nThis place would be subject to Alethi law and rules. He’d expected that\nTvlakv would want to avoid such things. But here, he’d probably also find\nthe best prices.\n“The Shattered Plains?” one of the slaves said. “Really?”\nOthers crowded around, peering out. In their sudden excitement, they\nseemed to forget their fear of Kaladin.\n“It is the Shattered Plains!” another man said. “That’s the king’s\narmy!”\n“Perhaps we’ll find justice here,” another said.\n“I hear the king’s house hold servants live as well as the finest\nmerchants,” said another. “His slaves have to be better off too. We’ll be in\nVorin lands; we’ll even make wages!”\nThat much was true. When worked, slaves had to be paid a small wage\n—half what a nonslave would be paid, which was already often less than a\nfull citizen would make for the same work. But it was something, and"

Only ardents—who couldn’t own anything anyway\n—didn’t have to be paid. Well, them and parshmen. But parshmen were\nmore animal than anything else.\nA slave could apply his earnings to his slave debt and, after years of\nlabor, earn his freedom. Theoretically. The others continued to chatter as the\nwagons rolled down the incline, but Kaladin withdrew to the back of the\nwagon. He suspected that the option to pay off a slave’s price was a sham,\nintended to keep slaves docile. The debt was enormous, far more than a\nslave sold for, and virtually impossible to earn out.\nUnder previous masters, he’d demanded his wages be given to him.\nThey had always found ways to cheat him—charging him for his housing,\nhis food. That’s how lighteyes were. Roshone, Amaram, Katarotam…Each\nlighteyes Kaladin had known, whether as a slave or a free man, had shown\nhimself to be corrupt to the core, for all his outward poise and beauty. They\nwere like rotting corpses clothed in beautiful silk.\nThe other slaves kept talking about the king’s army, and about justice.\nJustice? Kaladin thought, resting back against the bars. I’m not convinced\nthere is such a thing as justice. Still, he found himself wondering. That was\nthe king’s army—the armies of all ten highprinces—come to fulfill the\nVengeance Pact.\nIf there was one thing he still let himself long for, it was the chance to\nhold a spear. To fight again, to try and find his way back to the man he had\nbeen. A man who had cared.\nIf he would find that anywhere, he’d find it here.\n“I have seen the end, and have heard it named. The Night of Sorrows,\nthe True Desolation. The Everstorm.”\n—Collected on the 1st of Nanes, 1172, 15 seconds pre-death. Subject\nwas a darkeyed youth of unknown origin.\nShallan had not expected Jasnah Kholin to be so beautiful.\nIt was a stately, mature beauty—as one might find in the portrait of\nsome historical scholar. Shallan realized that she’d naively been expecting\nJasnah to be an ugly spinster, like the stern matrons who had tutored her\nyears ago. How else could one picture a heretic well into her mid-thirties\nand still unmarried?\nJasnah was nothing like that. She was tall and slender, with clear skin,\nnarrow black eyebrows, and thick, deep onyx hair. She wore part of it up,\nwrapped around a small, scroll-shaped golden ornament with two long\nhairpins holding it in place. The rest tumbled down behind her neck in\nsmall, tight curls. Even twisted and curled as it was, it came down to\nJasnah’s shoulders—if left unbound, it would be as long as Shallan’s hair,\nreaching past the middle of her back.\nShe had a squarish face and discriminating pale violet eyes.

She was\nlistening to a man dressed in robes of burnt orange and white, the\nKharbranthian royal colors. Brightness Kholin was several fingers taller\nthan the man—apparently, the Alethi reputation for height was no\nexaggeration. Jasnah glanced at Shallan, noting her, then returned to her\nconversation.\nStormfather! This woman was the sister of a king. Reserved,\nstatuesque, dressed immaculately in blue and silver. Like Shallan’s dress,\nJasnah’s buttoned up the sides and had a high collar, though Jasnah had a\nmuch fuller chest than Shallan. The skirts were loose below the waist,\nfalling generously to the floor. Her sleeves were long and stately, and the\nleft one was buttoned up to hide her safehand.\nOn her freehand was a distinctive piece of jewelry: two rings and a\nbracelet connected by several chains, holding a triangular group of\ngemstones across the back of the hand. A Soulcaster—the word was used\nfor both the people who performed the process and the fabrial that made it\npossible.\nShallan edged into the room, trying to get a better look at the large,\nglowing gemstones. Her heart began to beat a little faster. The Soulcaster\nlooked identical to the one she and her brothers had found in the inside\npocket of her father’s coat.\nJasnah and the man in robes began walking in Shallan’s direction, still\ntalking. How would Jasnah react, now that her ward had finally caught up to\nher? Would she be angry because of Shallan’s tardiness? Shallan couldn’t\nbe blamed for that, but people often expect irrational things from their\ninferiors.\nLike the grand cavern outside, this hallway was cut from the rock, but\nit was more richly furbished, with ornate hanging chandeliers made with\nStormlit gemstones. Most were deep violet garnets, which were among the\nless valuable stones. Even so, the sheer number hanging there glistening\nwith violet light would make the chandelier worth a small fortune. More\nthan that, however, Shallan was impressed with the symmetry of the design\nand the beauty of the pattern of crystals hanging at the sides of the\nchandelier.\nAs Jasnah grew near, Shallan could hear some of what she was saying.\n“…realize that this action might prompt an unfavorable reaction from\nthe devotaries?” the woman said, speaking in Alethi. It was very near to\nShallan’s native Veden, and she’d been taught to speak it well during her\nchildhood.\n“Yes, Brightness,” said the robed man. He was elderly, with a wispy\nwhite beard, and had pale grey eyes. His open, kindly face seemed very\nconcerned, and he wore a squat, cylindrical hat that matched the orange and\nwhite of his robes. Rich robes. Was this some kind of royal steward,\nperhaps?\nNo. Those gemstones on his fingers, the way he carried himself, the\nway other lighteyed attendants deferred to him…Stormfather! Shallan\nthought. This has to be the king himself! Not Jasnah’s brother, Elhokar, but\nthe king of Kharbranth. Taravangian."

Taravangian.\nShallan hastily performed an appropriate curtsy, which Jasnah noted.\n“The ardents have much sway here, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said with a\nsmooth voice.\n“As do I,” the king said. “You needn’t worry about me.”\n“Very well,” Jasnah said. “Your terms are agreeable. Lead me to the\nlocation, and I shall see what can be done. If you will excuse me as we\nwalk, however, I have someone to attend to.” Jasnah made a curt motion\ntoward Shallan, waving her to join them.\n“Of course, Brightness,” the king said. He seemed to defer to Jasnah.\nKharbranth was a very small kingdom—just a single city—while Alethkar\nwas one of the world’s most powerful. An Alethi princess might well\noutrank a Kharbranthian king in real terms, however protocol would have it.\nShallan hurried to catch up to Jasnah, who walked a little behind the\nking as he began to speak to his attendants. “Brightness,” Shallan said. “I\nam Shallan Davar, whom you asked to meet you. I deeply regret not being\nable to get to you in Dumadari.”\n“The fault was not yours,” Jasnah said with a wave of the fingers. “I\ndidn’t expect that you would make it in time. I wasn’t certain where I would\nbe going after Dumadari when I sent you that note, however.”\nJasnah wasn’t angry; that was a good sign. Shallan felt some of her\nanxiety recede.\n“I am impressed by your tenacity, child,” Jasnah continued. “I honestly\ndidn’t expect you to follow me this far. After Kharbranth, I was going to\nforgo leaving you notes, as I’d presumed that you’d have given up. Most do\nso after the first few stops.”\nMost? Then it was a test of some sort? And Shallan had passed?\n“Yes indeed,” Jasnah continued, voice musing. “Perhaps I will actually\nallow you to petition me for a place as my ward.”\nShallan almost stumbled in shock. Petition her? Wasn’t that what she’d\nalready done? “Brightness,” Shallan said, “I thought that…Well, your\nletter…”\nJasnah eyed her. “I gave you leave to meet me, Miss Davar. I did not\npromise to take you on. The training and care of a ward is a distraction for\nwhich I have little tolerance or time at the present. But you have traveled\nfar. I will entertain your request, though understand that my requirements\nare strict.”\nShallan covered a grimace.\n“No tantrum,” Jasnah noted. “That is a good sign.”\n“Tantrum, Brightness? From a lighteyed woman?”\n“You’d be surprised,” Jasnah said dryly. “But attitude alone will not\nearn your place. Tell me, how extensive is your education?”\n“Extensive in some areas,” Shallan said. Then she hesitantly added,\n“Extensively lacking in others.”\n“Very well,” Jasnah said. Ahead, the king seemed to be in a hurry, but"

Ahead, the king seemed to be in a hurry, but\nhe was old enough that even an urgent walk was still slow. “Then we shall\ndo an evaluation. Answer truthfully and do not exaggerate, as I will soon\ndiscover your lies. Feign no false modesty, either. I haven’t the patience for\na simperer.”\n“Yes, Brightness.”\n“We shall begin with music. How would you judge your skill?”\n“I have a good ear, Brightness,” Shallan said honestly. “I’m best with\nvoice, though I have been trained on the zither and the pipes. I would be far\nfrom the best you’d heard, but I’d also be far from the worst. I know most\nhistorical ballads by heart.”\n“Give me the refrain from ‘Lilting Adrene.’”\n“Here?”\n“I’m not fond of repeating myself, child.”\nShallan blushed, but began to sing. It wasn’t her finest performance,\nbut her tone was pure and she didn’t stumble over any of the words.\n“Good,” Jasnah said as Shallan paused for a breath. “Languages?”\nShallan fumbled for a moment, bringing her attention away from\nfrantically trying to remember the next verse. Languages? “I can speak your\nnative Alethi, obviously,” Shallan said. “I have a passable reading\nknowledge of Thaylen and good spoken Azish. I can make myself\nunderstood in Selay, but not read it.”\nJasnah made no comment either way. Shallan began to grow nervous.\n“Writing?” Jasnah asked.\n“I know all of the major, minor, and topical glyphs and can paint them\ncalligraphically.”\n“So can most children.”\n“The glyphwards that I paint are regarded by those who know me as\nquite impressive.”\n“Glyphwards?” Jasnah said. “I had reason to believe you wanted to be\na scholar, not a purveyor of superstitious nonsense.”\n“I have kept a journal since I was a child,” Shallan continued, “in order\nto practice my writing skills.”\n“Congratulations,” Jasnah said. “Should I need someone to write a\ntreatise on their stuffed pony or give an account of an interesting pebble\nthey discovered, I shall send for you. Is there nothing you can offer that\nshows you have true skill?”\nShallan blushed. “With all due respect, Brightness, you have a letter\nfrom me yourself, and it was persuasive enough to make you grant me this\naudience.”\n“A valid point,” Jasnah said, nodding. “It took you long enough to\nmake it. How is your training in logic and its related arts?”\n“I am accomplished in basic mathematics,” Shallan said, still flustered,\n“and I often helped with minor accounts for my father. I have read through\nthe complete works of Tormas, Nashan, Niali the Just, and—of course—\nNohadon.”\n“Placini?”\nWho? “No.”\n“Gabrathin, Yustara, Manaline, Syasikk, Shauka-daughter-Hasweth?”\nShallan cringed and shook her head again.

        "text": "“Gabrathin, Yustara, Manaline, Syasikk, Shauka-daughter-Hasweth?”\nShallan cringed and shook her head again. That last name was\nobviously Shin. Did the Shin people even have logicmasters? Did Jasnah\nreally expect her wards to have studied such obscure texts?\n“I see,” Jasnah said. “Well, what of history?”\nHistory. Shallan shrank down even further. “I…This is one of the areas\nwhere I’m obviously deficient, Brightness. My father was never able to find\na suitable tutor for me. I read the history books he owned….”\n“Which were?”\n“The entire set of Barlesha Lhan’s Topics, mostly.”\nJasnah waved her freehand dismissively. “Barely worth the time spent\nscribing them. A popular survey of historical events at best.”\n“I apologize, Brightness.”\n“This is an embarrassing hole. History is the most important of the\nliterary subarts. One would think that your parents would have taken\nspecific care in this area, if they’d hoped to submit you to study under a\nhistorian like myself.”\n“My circumstances are unusual, Brightness.”\n“Ignorance is hardly unusual, Miss Davar. The longer I live, the more I\ncome to realize that it is the natural state of the human mind. There are\nmany who will strive to defend its sanctity and then expect you to be\nimpressed with their efforts.”\nShallan blushed again. She’d realized she had some deficiencies, but\nJasnah had unreasonable expectations. She said nothing, continuing to walk\nbeside the taller woman. How long was this hallway, anyway? She was so\nflustered she didn’t even look at the paintings they passed. They turned a\ncorner, walking deeper into the mountainside.\n“Well, let us move on to science, then,” Jasnah said, tone displeased.\n“What can you say of yourself there?”\n“I have the reasonable foundation in the sciences you might expect of\na young woman my age,” Shallan said, more stiffly than she would have\nliked.\n“Which means?”\n“I can speak with skill about geography, geology, physics, and\nchemistry. I’ve made particular study of biology and botany, as I was able\nto pursue them with a reasonable level of independence on my father’s\nestates. But if you expect me to be able to solve Fabrisan’s Conundrum with\na wave of my hand, I suspect you shall be disappointed.”\n“Have I not a right to make reasonable demands of my potential\nstudents, Miss Davar?”\n“Reasonable? Your demands are about as reasonable as the ones made\nof the Ten Heralds on Proving Day! With all due respect, Brightness, you\nseem to want potential wards to be master scholars already. I may be able to\nfind a pair of eighty-year-old ardents in the city who might fit your\nrequirements. They could interview for the position, though they may have\ntrouble hearing well enough to answer your questions.”\n“I see,” Jasnah replied. “And do you speak with such pique to your\nparents as well?”\nShallan winced. Her time spent with the sailors had loosened her\ntongue far too much. Had she traveled all this way only to off end Jasnah?"

        "text": "parents as well?”\nShallan winced. Her time spent with the sailors had loosened her\ntongue far too much. Had she traveled all this way only to off end Jasnah?\nShe thought of her brothers, destitute, keeping up a tenuous façade back\nhome. Would she have to return to them in defeat, having squandered this\nopportunity? “I did not speak to them this way, Brightness. Nor should I to\nyou. I apologize.”\n“Well, at least you are humble enough to admit fault. Still, I am\ndisappointed. How is it that your mother considered you ready for a\nwardship?”\n“My mother passed away when I was just a child, Brightness.”\n“And your father soon remarried. Malise Gevelmar, I believe.”\nShallan started at her knowledge. House Davar was ancient, but only\nof middling power and importance. The fact that Jasnah knew the name\nof Shallan’s stepmother said a lot about her. “My stepmother passed away\nrecently. She didn’t send me to be your ward. I took this initiative upon\nmyself.”\n“My condolences,” Jasnah said. “Perhaps you should be with your\nfather, seeing to his estates and comforting him, rather than wasting my\ntime.”\nThe men walking ahead turned down another side passage. Jasnah and\nShallan followed, entering a smaller corridor with an ornate red and yellow\nrug, mirrors hanging on the walls.\nShallan turned to Jasnah. “My father has no need of me.” Well, that\nwas true. “But I have great need of you, as this interview itself has proven.\nIf ignorance galls you so much, can you in good conscience pass up the\nopportunity to rid me of mine?”\n“I’ve done so before, Miss Davar. You are the twelfth young woman to\nask me for a wardship this year.”\nTwelve? Shallan thought. In one year? And she’d assumed that women\nwould stay away from Jasnah because of her antagonism toward the\ndevotaries.\nThe group reached the end of the narrow hallway, turning a corner to\nfind—to Shallan’s surprise—a place where a large chunk of rock had fallen\nfrom the ceiling. A dozen or so attendants stood here, some looking\nanxious. What was going on?\nMuch of the rubble had evidently been cleared away, though the gouge\nin the ceiling gaped ominously. It didn’t look out on the sky; they had been\nprogressing downward, and were probably far underground. A massive\nstone, taller than a man, had fallen into a doorway on the left. There was no\ngetting past it into the room beyond. Shallan thought she heard sounds on\nthe other side. The king stepped up to the stone, speaking in a comforting\nvoice. He pulled a handkerchief out of his pocket and wiped his aged brow.\n“The dangers of living in a building cut directly into the rock,” Jasnah\nsaid, striding forward. “When did this happen?” Apparently she hadn’t been\nsummoned to the city specifically for this purpose; the king was simply\ntaking advantage of her presence.\n“During the recent highstorm, Brightness,” the king said. He shook his\nhead, making his drooping, thin white mustache tremble. “The palace\narchitects might be able to cut a way into the room, but it would take time,"

Beyond that,\nbreaking in might bring down more of the ceiling.”\n“I thought Kharbranth was protected from the highstorms, Your\nMajesty,” Shallan said, causing Jasnah to shoot her a glance.\n“The city is sheltered, young woman,” the king said. “But the stone\nmountain behind us is buffeted quite strongly. Sometimes it causes\navalanches on that side, and that can cause the entire mountainside to\nshake.” He glanced at the ceiling. “Cave-ins are very rare, and we thought\nthis area was quite safe, but…”\n“But it is rock,” Jasnah said, “and there is no telling if a weak vein\nlurks just beyond the surface.” She inspected the monolith that had fallen\nfrom the ceiling. “This will be difficult. I will probably lose a very valuable\nfocal stone.”\n“I—” the king began, wiping his brow again. “If only we had a\nShardblade—”\nJasnah cut him off with a wave of the hand. “I was not seeking to\nrenegotiate our bargain, Your Majesty. Access to the Palanaeum is worth the\ncost. You will want to send someone for wet rags. Have the majority of the\nservants move down to the other end of the hallway. You may wish to wait\nthere yourself.”\n“I will stay here,” the king said, causing his attendants to object,\nincluding a large man wearing a black leather cuirass, probably his\nbodyguard. The king silenced them by raising his wrinkled hand. “I will not\nhide like a coward when my granddaughter is trapped.”\nNo wonder he was so anxious. Jasnah didn’t argue further, and Shallan\ncould see from her eyes that it was of no consequence to her if the king\nrisked his life. The same apparently went for Shallan, for Jasnah didn’t\norder her away. Servants approached with wetted cloths and distributed\nthem. Jasnah refused hers. The king and his bodyguard raised theirs to their\nfaces, covering mouth and nose.\nShallan took hers. What was the point of it? A couple of servants\npassed some wet cloths through a space between the rock and the wall to\nthose inside. Then all of the servants rushed away down the hallway.\nJasnah picked and prodded at the boulder. “Miss Davar,” she said,\n“what method would you use to ascertain the mass of this stone?”\nShallan blinked. “Well, I suppose I’d ask His Majesty. His architects\nprobably calculated it.”\nJasnah cocked her head. “An elegant response. Did they do that, Your\nMajesty?”\n“Yes, Brightness Kholin,” the king said. “It’s roughly fifteen thousand\nkavals.”\nJasnah eyed Shallan. “A point in your favor, Miss Davar. A scholar\nknows not to waste time rediscovering information already known. It’s a\nlesson I sometimes forget.”\nShallan felt herself swell at the words. She already had an inkling that\nJasnah did not give such praise lightly. Did this mean that the woman was\nstill considering her as a ward?"

Did this mean that the woman was\nstill considering her as a ward?\nJasnah held up her freehand, Soulcaster glistening against the skin.\nShallan felt her heartbeat speed up. She’d never seen Soulcasting done in\nperson. The ardents were very secretive in using their fabrials, and she\nhadn’t even known that her father had one until they’d found it on him. Of\ncourse, his no longer worked. That was one of the main reasons she was\nhere.\nThe gemstones set into Jasnah’s Soulcaster were enormous, some of\nthe largest that Shallan had ever seen, worth many spheres each. One was\nsmokestone, a pure glassy black gemstone. The second was a diamond. The\nthird was a ruby. All three were cut—a cut stone could hold more\nStormlight—into glistening, many-faceted oval shapes.\nJasnah closed her eyes, pressing her hand against the fallen boulder.\nShe raised her head, inhaling slowly. The stones on the back of her hand\nbegan to glow more fiercely, the smokestone in particular growing so bright\nit was difficult to look at.\nShallan held her breath. The only thing she dared do was blink,\ncommitting the scene to memory. For a long, extended moment, nothing\nhappened.\nAnd then, briefly, Shallan heard a sound. A low thrumming, like a\ndistant group of voices, humming together a single, pure note.\nJasnah’s hand sank into the rock.\nThe stone vanished.\nA burst of dense black smoke exploded into the hallway. Enough to\nblind Shallan; it seemed the output of a thousand fires, and smelled of\nburned wood. Shallan hastily raised the wet rag to her face, dropping to her\nknees. Oddly, her ears felt stopped up, as if she’d climbed down from a\ngreat height. She had to swallow to pop them.\nShe shut her eyes tightly as they began to water, and she held her\nbreath. Her ears filled with a rushing sound.\nIt passed. She blinked open her eyes to find the king and his bodyguard\nhuddled against the wall beside to her. Smoke still pooled at the ceiling; the\nhallway smelled strongly of it. Jasnah stood, eyes still closed, oblivious of\nthe smoke—though grime now dusted her face and clothing. It had left\nmarks on the walls too.\nShallan had read of this, but she was still in awe. Jasnah had\ntransformed the boulder into smoke, and since smoke was far less dense\nthan stone, the change had pushed the smoke away in an explosive outburst.\nIt was true; Jasnah really did have a functioning Soulcaster. And a\npowerful one too. Nine out of ten Soulcasters were capable of a few limited\ntransformations: creating water or grain from stone; forming bland, single-\nroomed rock buildings out of air or cloth. A greater one, like Jasnah’s, could\neffectuate any transformation. Literally turn any substance into any other\none. How it must grate on the ardents that such a powerful, holy relic was in\nthe hands of someone outside the ardentia. And a heretic no less!"

And a heretic no less!\nShallan stumbled to her feet, leaving the cloth at her mouth, breathing\nhumid but dust-free air. She swallowed, her ears popping again as the hall’s\npressure returned to normal. A moment later, the king rushed into the now-\naccessible room. A small girl—along with several nursemaids and other\npalace servants—sat on the other side, coughing. The king pulled the girl\ninto his arms. She was too young to have a modesty sleeve.\nJasnah opened her eyes, blinking, as if momentarily confused by her\nlocation. She took a deep breath, and didn’t cough. Indeed, she actually\nsmiled, as if enjoying the scent of the smoke.\nJasnah turned to Shallan, focusing on her. “You are still waiting for a\nresponse. I’m afraid you will not like what I say.”\n“But you haven’t finished your testing of me yet,” Shallan said, forcing\nherself to be bold. “Surely you won’t give judgment until you have.”\n“I haven’t finished?” Jasnah asked, frowning.\n“You didn’t ask me about all of the feminine arts. You left out painting\nand drawing.”\n“I have never had much use for them.”\n“But they are of the arts,” Shallan said, feeling desperate. This was\nwhere she was most accomplished! “Many consider the visual arts the most\nrefined of them all. I brought my portfolio. I would show you what I can\ndo.”\nJasnah pursed her lips. “The visual arts are frivolity. I have weighed\nthe facts, child, and I cannot accept you. I’m sorry.”\nShallan’s heart sank.\n“Your Majesty,” Jasnah said to the king, “I would like to go to the\nPalanaeum.”\n“Now?” the king said, cradling his granddaughter. “But we are going\nto have a feast—”\n“I appreciate the offer,” Jasnah said, “but I find myself with an\nabundance of everything but time.”\n“Of course,” the king said. “I will take you personally. Thank you for\nwhat you’ve done. When I heard that you had requested entrance…” He\ncontinued to babble at Jasnah, who followed him wordlessly down the\nhallway, leaving Shallan behind.\nShe clutched her satchel to her chest, lowering the cloth from her\nmouth. Six months of chasing, for this. She gripped the rag in frustration,\nsqueezing sooty water between her fingers. She wanted to cry. That was\nwhat she probably would have done if she’d been that same child she had\nbeen six months ago.\nBut things had changed. She had changed. If she failed, House Davar\nwould fall. Shallan felt her determination redouble, though she wasn’t able\nto stop a few tears of frustration from squeezing out of the corners of her\neyes. She was not going to give up until Jasnah was forced to truss her up in\nchains and have the authorities drag her away.\nHer step surprisingly firm, she walked in the direction Jasnah had\ngone.

Not for the prestige. But in order to learn where she kept her\nSoulcaster.\nAnd then Shallan would steal it.\nCharcoal rubbing of a map of Sadeas’s warcamp as used by a\ncommom spearman. It was scrarched on the back of a palm-sized\ncremling shell. Rubbing labeled in ink by an anonymous Alethi\nscholar, circa 1173.\n“I’m cold. Mother, I’m cold. Mother? Why can I still hear the rain?\nWill it stop?”\n—Collected on Vevishes, 1172, 32 seconds pre-death. Subject was a\nlighteyed female child, approximately six years old.\nTvlakv released all of the slaves from their cages at once. This time, he\ndidn’t fear runaways or a slave rebellion—not with nothing but wilderness\nbehind them and over a hundred thousand armed soldiers just ahead.\nKaladin stepped down from the wagon. They were inside one of the\ncraterlike formations, its jagged stone wall rising just to the east. The\nground had been cleared of plant life, and the rock was slick beneath his\nunshod feet. Pools of rainwater had gathered in depressions. The air was\ncrisp and clean, and the sun strong overhead, though with this Eastern\nhumidity, he always felt damp.\nAround them spread the signs of an army long settled; this war had\nbeen going on since the old king’s death, nearly six years ago. Everyone\ntold stories of that night, the night when Parshendi tribesmen had murdered\nKing Gavilar.\nSquads of soldiers marched by, following directions indicated by\npainted circles at each intersection. The camp was packed with long stone\nbunkers, and there were more tents than Kaladin had discerned from above.\nSoulcasters couldn’t be used to create every shelter. After the stink of the\nslave caravan, the place smelled good, brimming with familiar scents like\ntreated leather and oiled weapons. However, many of the soldiers had a\ndisorderly look. They weren’t dirty, but they didn’t seem particularly\ndisciplined either. They roamed the camp in packs with coats undone. Some\npointed and jeered at the slaves. This was the army of a highprince? The\nelite force that fought for Alethkar’s honor? This was what Kaladin had\naspired to join?\nBluth and Tag watched carefully as Kaladin lined up with the other\nslaves, but he didn’t try anything. Now was not the time to provoke them—\nKaladin had seen how mercenaries acted when around commissioned\ntroops. Bluth and Tag played their part, walking with their chests out and\nhands on their weapons. They shoved a few of the slaves into place,\nramming a cudgel into one man’s belly and cursing him gruffly.\nThey stayed clear of Kaladin.\n“The king’s army,” said the slave next to him. It was the dark-skinned\nman who had talked to Kaladin about escaping. “I thought we were meant\nfor mine work. Why, this won’t be so bad at all. We’ll be cleaning latrines\nor maintaining roads.”"

        "text": "man who had talked to Kaladin about escaping. “I thought we were meant\nfor mine work. Why, this won’t be so bad at all. We’ll be cleaning latrines\nor maintaining roads.”\nOdd, to look forward to latrine work or labor in the hot sun. Kaladin\nhoped for something else. Hoped. Yes, he’d discovered that he could still\nhope. A spear in his hands. An enemy to face. He could live like that.\nTvlakv spoke with an important-looking lighteyed woman. She wore\nher dark hair up in a complex weave, sparkling with infused amethysts, and\nher dress was a deep crimson. She looked much as Laral had, at the end.\nShe was probably of the fourth or fifth dahn, wife and scribe to one of the\ncamp’s officers.\nTvlakv began to brag about his wares, but the woman raised a delicate\nhand. “I can see what I am purchasing, slaver,” she said in a smooth,\naristocratic accent. “I will inspect them myself.”\nShe began to walk down the line, accompanied by several soldiers. Her\ndress was cut in the Alethi noble fashion—a solid swath of silk, tight and\nformfitting through the top with sleek skirts below. It buttoned up the sides\nof the torso from waist to neck, where it was topped by a small, gold-\nembroidered collar. The longer left cuff hid her safehand. Kaladin’s mother\nhad always just worn a glove, which seemed far more practical to him.\nJudging by her face, she was not particularly impressed with what she\nsaw. “These men are half-starved and sickly,” she said, taking a thin rod\nfrom a young female attendant. She used it to lift the hair from one man’s\nforehead, inspecting his brand. “You are asking two emerald broams a\nhead?”\nTvlakv began to sweat. “Perhaps one and a half?”\n“And what would I use them for? I wouldn’t trust men this filthy near\nfood, and we have parshmen to do most other work.”\n“If Your Ladyship is not pleased, I could approach other\nhighprinces….”\n“No,” she said, smacking the slave she’d been regarding as he shied\naway from her. “One and a quarter. They can help cut timber for us in the\nnorthern forests….” She trailed off as she noticed Kaladin. “Here now. This\nis far better stock than the others.”\n“I thought that you might like this one,” Tvlakv said, stepping up to\nher. “He is quite—”\nShe raised the rod and silenced Tvlakv. She had a small sore on one\nlip. Some ground cussweed root could help with that.\n“Remove your top, slave,” she commanded.\nKaladin stared her right in her blue eyes and felt an almost irresistible\nurge to spit at her. No. No, he couldn’t afford that. Not when there was a\nchance. He pulled his arms out of the sacklike clothing, letting it fall to his\nwaist, exposing his chest.\nDespite eight months as a slave, he was far better muscled than the\nothers. “A large number of scars for one so young,” the noblewoman said\nthoughtfully. “You are a military man?”"

Then she used\nthe rod to push aside Kaladin’s hair and inspect his forehead.\n“Shash glyph,” she said, clicking her tongue. Several of the soldiers\nnearby stepped closer, hands on their swords. “Where I come from, slaves\nwho deserve these are simply executed.”\n“They are fortunate,” Kaladin said.\n“And how did you end up here?”\n“I killed someone,” Kaladin said, preparing his lies carefully. Please,\nhe thought to the Heralds. Please. It had been a long time since he had\nprayed for anything.\nThe woman raised an eyebrow.\n“I’m a murderer, Brightness,” Kaladin said. “Got drunk, made some\nmistakes. But I can use a spear as well as any man. Put me in your\nbrightlord’s army. Let me fight again.” It was a strange lie to make, but the\nwoman would never let Kaladin fight if she thought he was a deserter. In\nthis case, better to be known as an accidental murderer.\nPlease… he thought. To be a soldier again. It seemed, in one moment,\nthe most glorious thing he could ever have wanted. How much better it\nwould be to die on the battlefield than waste away emptying chamber pots.\nTo the side, Tvlakv stepped up beside the lighteyed woman. He\nglanced at Kaladin, then sighed. “He’s a deserter, Brightness. Don’t listen to\nhim.”\nNo! Kaladin felt a blazing burst of anger consume his hope. He raised\nhands toward Tvlakv. He’d strangle the rat, and—\nSomething cracked him across the back. He grunted, stumbling and\nfalling to one knee. The noblewoman stepped back, raising her safehand to\nher breast in alarm. One of the army soldiers grabbed Kaladin and towed\nhim back to his feet.\n“Well,” she finally said. “That is unfortunate.”\n“I can fight,” Kaladin growled against the pain. “Give me a spear. Let\nme—”\nShe raised her rod, cutting him off.\n“Brightness,” Tvlakv said, not meeting Kaladin’s eyes. “I would not\ntrust him with a weapon. It is true that he is a murderer, but he is also\nknown to disobey and lead rebellions against his masters. I couldn’t sell\nhim to you as a bonded soldier. My conscience, it would not allow it.” He\nhesitated. “The men in his wagon, he might have corrupted them all with\ntalk of escape. My honor demands that I tell you this.”\nKaladin gritted his teeth. He was tempted to try to take down the\nsoldier behind him, grab that spear and spend his last moments ramming it\nthrough Tvlakv’s portly gut. Why? What did it matter to Tvlakv how\nKaladin was treated by this army?"

What did it matter to Tvlakv how\nKaladin was treated by this army?\nI should never have ripped up the map, Kaladin though. Bitterness is\nrepaid more often than kindness. One of his father’s sayings.\nThe woman nodded, moving on. “Show me which ones,” she said. “I’ll\nstill take them, because of your honesty. We need some new bridgemen.”\nTvlakv nodded eagerly. Before moving on, he paused and leaned in to\nKaladin. “I cannot trust that you will behave. The people in this army, they\nwill blame a merchant for not revealing all he knew. I…am sorry.” With\nthat, the merchant scuttled away.\nKaladin growled in the back of his throat, and then pulled himself free\nof the soldiers, but remained in line. So be it. Cutting down trees, building\nbridges, fighting in the army. None of it mattered. He would just keep\nliving. They’d taken his freedom, his family, his friends, and—most dear of\nall—his dreams. They could do nothing more to him.\nAfter her inspection, the noblewoman took a writing board from her\nassistant and made a few quick notations on its paper. Tvlakv gave her a\nledger detailing how much each slave had paid down on their slave debt.\nKaladin caught a glimpse; it said that not a single one of the men had paid\nanything. Perhaps Tvlakv lied about the figures. Not unlikely.\nKaladin would probably just let all of his wages go to his debt this\ntime. Let them squirm as they saw him actually call their bluff. What would\nthey do if he got close to earning out his debt? He’d probably never find out\n—depending on what these bridgemen earned, it could take anything from\nten to fifty years to get there.\nThe lighteyed woman assigned most of the slaves to forest duty. A\nhalf-dozen of the more spindly ones were sent to work the mess halls,\ndespite what she’d said before. “Those ten,” the noblewoman said, raising\nher rod to point at Kaladin and the others from his wagon. “Take them to\nthe bridge crews. Tell Lamaril and Gaz that the tall one is to be given\nspecial treatment.”\nThe soldiers laughed, and one began shoving Kaladin’s group along\nthe pathway. Kaladin endured it; these men had no reason to be gentle, and\nhe wouldn’t give them a reason to be rougher. If there was a group citizen\nsoldiers hated more than mercenaries, it was deserters.\nAs he walked, he couldn’t help noticing the banner flying above the\ncamp. It bore the same symbol emblazoned on the soldiers’ uniform coats: a\nyellow glyphpair in the shape of a tower and a hammer on a field of deep\ngreen. That was the banner of Highprince Sadeas, ultimate ruler of\nKaladin’s own home district. Was it irony or fate that had landed Kaladin\nhere?\nSoldiers lounged idly, even those who appeared to be on duty, and the\ncamp streets were littered with refuse. Camp followers were plentiful:\nwhores, worker women, coopers, chandlers, and wranglers. There were"

        "text": "camp streets were littered with refuse. Camp followers were plentiful:\nwhores, worker women, coopers, chandlers, and wranglers. There were\neven children running through the streets of what was half city, half\nwarcamp.\nThere were also parshmen. Carrying water, working on trenches,\nlifting sacks. That surprised him. Weren’t they fighting parshmen? Weren’t\nthey worried that these would rise up? Apparently not. The parshmen here\nworked with the same docility as the ones back in Hearthstone. Perhaps it\nmade sense. Alethi had fought against Alethi back in his armies at home, so\nwhy shouldn’t there be parshmen on both sides of this conflict?\nThe soldiers took Kaladin all the way around to the northeastern\nquarter of the camp, a hike that took some time. Though the Soulcast stone\nbarracks each looked exactly the same, the rim of the camp was broken\ndistinctively, like ragged mountains. Old habits made him memorize the\nroute. Here, the towering circular wall had been worn away by countless\nhighstorms, giving a clear view eastward. That open patch of ground would\nmake a good staging area for an army to gather on before marching down\nthe incline to the Shattered Plains themselves.\nThe northern edge of the field contained a subcamp filled with several\ndozen barracks, and at their center a lumberyard filled with carpenters. They\nwere breaking down some of the stout trees Kaladin had seen on the plains\noutside: stripping off their stringy bark, sawing them into planks. Another\ngroup of carpenters assembled the planks into large contraptions.\n“We’re to be woodworkers?” Kaladin asked.\nOne of the soldiers laughed roughly. “You’re joining the bridge\ncrews.” He pointed to where a group of sorry-looking men sat on the stones\nin the shade of a barrack, scooping food out of wooden bowls with their\nfingers. It looked depressingly similar to the slop that Tvlakv had fed them.\nOne of the soldiers shoved Kaladin forward again, and he stumbled\ndown the shallow incline and crossed the grounds. The other nine slaves\nfollowed, herded by the soldiers. None of the men sitting around the\nbarracks so much as glanced at them. They wore leather vests and simple\ntrousers, some with dirty laced shirts, others bare-chested. The grim, sorry\nlot weren’t much better than the slaves, though they did look to be in\nslightly better physical condition.\n“New recruits, Gaz,” one of the soldiers called.\nA man lounged in the shade a distance from the eating men. He turned,\nrevealing a face that was so scarred his beard grew in patches. He was\nmissing one eye—the other was brown—and didn’t bother with an eye\npatch. White knots at his shoulders marked him as a sergeant, and he had\nthe lean toughness Kaladin had learned to associate with someone who\nknew his way around a battlefield.\n“These spindly things?” Gaz said, chewing on something as he walked\nover. “They’ll barely stop an arrow.”\nThe soldier beside Kaladin shrugged, shoving him forward once more\nfor good measure. “Brightness Hashal said to do something special with\nthis one. The rest are up to you.” The soldier nodded to his companions, and\nthey began to trot away."

        "text": "for good measure. “Brightness Hashal said to do something special with\nthis one. The rest are up to you.” The soldier nodded to his companions, and\nthey began to trot away.\nGaz looked the slaves over. He focused on Kaladin last.\n“I have military training,” Kaladin said. “In the army of Highlord\nAmaram.”\n“I don’t really care,” Gaz cut in, spitting something dark to the side.\nKaladin hesitated. “When Amaram—”\n“You keep mentioning that name,” Gaz snapped. “Served under some\nunimportant landlord, did you? Expect me to be impressed?”\nKaladin sighed. He’d met this kind of man before, a lesser sergeant\nwith no hope of advancement. His only pleasure in life came from his\nauthority over those even sorrier than himself. Well, so be it.\n“You have a slave’s mark,” Gaz said, snorting. “I doubt you ever held\na spear. Either way, you’ll have to condescend to join us now, Lordship.”\nKaladin’s windspren flitted down and inspected Gaz, then closed one\nof her eyes, imitating him. For some reason, seeing her made Kaladin smile.\nGaz misinterpreted the smile. The man scowled and stepped forward,\npointing.\nAt that moment, a loud chorus of horns echoed through the camp.\nCarpenters glanced up, and the soldiers who had guided Kaladin dashed\nback toward the center of camp. The slaves behind Kaladin looked around\nanxiously.\n“Stormfather!” Gaz cursed. “Bridgemen! Up, up, you louts!” He began\nkicking at some of the men who were eating. They scattered their bowls,\nscrambling to their feet. They wore simple sandals instead of proper boots.\n“You, Lordship,” Gaz said, pointing at Kaladin.\n“I didn’t say—”\n“I don’t care what in Damnation you said! You’re in Bridge Four.” He\npointed at a group of departing bridgemen. “The rest of you, go wait over\nthere. I’ll divide you up later. Get moving, or I’ll see you strung up by your\nheels.”\nKaladin shrugged and jogged after the group of bridgemen. It was one\nof many teams of such men pouring out of barracks or picking themselves\nup out of alleys. There seemed to be quite a lot of them. Around fifty\nbarracks, with—perhaps—twenty or thirty men in each…that would make\nnearly as many bridgemen in this army as there had been soldiers in\nAmaram’s entire force.\nKaladin’s team crossed the grounds, weaving between boards and piles\nof sawdust, approaching a large wooden contraption. It had obviously\nweathered a few highstorms and some battles. The dents and holes scattered\nalong its length looked like places where arrows had struck. The bridge in\nbridgeman, perhaps?\nYes, Kaladin thought. It was a wooden bridge, around thirty feet long,\neight feet wide. It sloped down at the front and back, and had no railings.\nThe wood was thick, with the largest boards for support through the center.\nThere were some forty or fifty bridges lined up here. Perhaps one for each\nbarrack, making one crew for each bridge? About twenty bridge crews were\ngathering at this point."

        "text": "There were some forty or fifty bridges lined up here. Perhaps one for each\nbarrack, making one crew for each bridge? About twenty bridge crews were\ngathering at this point.\nGaz had found himself a wooden shield and a gleaming mace, but\nthere were none for anyone else. He quickly inspected each team. He\nstopped beside Bridge Four and hesitated. “Where’s your bridgeleader?” he\ndemanded.\n“Dead,” one of the bridgemen said. “Tossed himself down the Honor\nChasm last night.”\nGaz cursed. “Can’t you keep a bridgeleader for even a week? Storm it!\nLine up; I’ll run near you. Listen for my commands. We’ll sort out another\nbridgeleader after we see who survives.” Gaz pointed at Kaladin. “You’re at\nthe back, lordling. The rest of you, get moving! Storm you, I won’t suffer\nanother reprimand because of you fools! Move, move!”\nThe others were lifting. Kaladin had no choice but to go to the open\nslot at the tail of the bridge. He’d been a little low in his assessment; looked\nlike about thirty-five to forty men per bridge. There was room for five men\nacross—three under the bridge and one on each side—and eight deep,\nthough this crew didn’t have a man for each position.\nHe helped lift the bridge into the air. They were probably using a very\nlight wood for the bridges, but the thing was still storms-cursed heavy.\nKaladin grunted as he struggled with the weight, hoisting the bridge up high\nand then stepping underneath. Men dashed in to fill the middle slots down\nthe length of the structure, and slowly they all set the bridge down on their\nshoulders. At least there were rods on the bottom to use as handholds.\nThe other men had pads on the shoulders of their vests to cushion the\nweight and adjust their height to fit the supports. Kaladin hadn’t been given\na vest, so the wooden supports dug directly into his skin. He couldn’t see a\nthing; there was an indentation for his head, but wood cut off his view to all\nsides. The men at the edges had better views; he suspected those spots were\nmore coveted.\nThe wood smelled of oil and sweat.\n“Go!” Gaz said from outside, voice muffled.\nKaladin grunted as the crew broke into a jog. He couldn’t see where he\nwas going, and struggled to keep from tripping as the bridge crew marched\ndown the eastern slope to the Shattered Plains. Soon, Kaladin was sweating\nand cursing under his breath, the wood rubbing and digging into the skin on\nhis shoulders. He was already starting to bleed.\n“Poor fool,” a voice said from the side.\nKaladin glanced to the right, but the wooden handholds obstructed his\nview. “Are you…” Kaladin puffed. “Are you talking to me?”\n“You shouldn’t have insulted Gaz,” the man said. His voice sounded\nhollow. “He sometimes lets new men run in an outside row. Sometimes.”\nKaladin tried to respond, but he was already gasping for breath. He’d\nthought himself in better shape than this, but he’d spent eight months being\nfed slop, being beaten, and waiting out highstorms in leaking cellars,\nmuddy barns, or cages. He was hardly the same man anymore."

He was hardly the same man anymore.\n“Breathe in and out deeply,” said the muffled voice. “Focus on the\nsteps. Count them. It helps.”\nKaladin followed the advice. He could hear other bridge crews running\nnearby. Behind them came the familiar sounds of men marching and\nhoofbeats on the stone. They were being followed by an army.\nBelow, rockbuds and small shalebark ridges grew from the stone,\ntripping him. The landscape of the Shattered Plains appeared to be broken,\nuneven, and rent, covered with outcroppings and shelves of rock. That\nexplained why they didn’t use wheels on the bridges—porters were\nprobably much faster over such rough terrain.\nSoon, his feet were ragged and battered. Couldn’t they have given him\nshoes? He set his jaw against the agony and kept on going. Just another job.\nHe would continue, and he would survive.\nA thumping sound. His feet fell on wood. A bridge, a permanent one,\ncrossing a chasm between plateaus on the Shattered Plains. In seconds the\nbridge crew was across it, and his feet fell on stone again.\n“Move, move!” Gaz bellowed. “Storm you, keep going!”\nThey continued jogging as the army crossed the bridge behind them,\nhundreds of boots resounding on the wood. Before too long, blood ran\ndown Kaladin’s shoulders. His breathing was torturous, his side aching\npainfully. He could hear others gasping, the sounds carrying through the\nconfined space beneath the bridge. So he wasn’t the only one. Hopefully,\nthey would arrive at their destination quickly.\nHe hoped in vain.\nThe next hour was torture. It was worse than any beating he’d suffered\nas a slave, worse than any wound on the battlefield. There seemed to be no\nend to the march. Kaladin vaguely remembered seeing the permanent\nbridges, back when he’d looked down on the plains from the slave cart.\nThey connected the plateaus where the chasms were easiest to span, not\nwhere it would be most efficient for those traveling. That often meant\ndetours north or south before they could continue eastward.\nThe bridgemen grumbled, cursed, groaned, then fell silent. They\ncrossed bridge after bridge, plateau after plateau. Kaladin never got a good\nlook at one of the chasms. He just kept running. And running. He couldn’t\nfeel his feet any longer. He kept running. He knew, somehow, that if he\nstopped, he’d be beaten. He felt as if his shoulders had been rubbed to the\nbone. He tried counting steps, but was too exhausted even for that.\nBut he didn’t stop running.\nFinally, mercifully, Gaz called for them to halt. Kaladin blinked,\nstumbling to a stop and nearly collapsing.\n“Lift!” Gaz bellowed.\nThe men lifted, Kaladin’s arms straining at the motion after so much\ntime holding the bridge in one place.\n“Drop!”\nThey stepped aside, the bridgemen underneath taking handholds at the\nsides. It was awkward and difficult, but these men had practice, apparently.\nThey kept the bridge from toppling as they set it on the ground.\n“Push!”"

They were at the edge of a\nchasm lacking a permanent bridge. To the sides, the other bridge crews\nwere pushing their own bridges forward.\nKaladin glanced over his shoulder. The army was two thousand men in\nforest green and pure white. Twelve hundred darkeyed spearmen, several\nhundred cavalry atop rare, precious horses. Behind them, a large group of\nheavy foot, lighteyed men in thick armor and carrying large maces and\nsquare steel shields.\nIt seemed that they’d intentionally chosen a point where the chasm was\nnarrow and the first plateau was a little higher than the second. The bridge\nwas twice as long as the chasm’s width here. Gaz cursed at him, so Kaladin\njoined the others, shoving the bridge across the rough ground with a\nscraping sound. When the bridge thumped into place on the other side of the\nchasm, the bridge crew drew back to let the cavalry trot across.\nHe was too exhausted to watch. He collapsed to the stones and lay\nback, listening to sounds of foot soldiers tromping across the bridge. He\nrolled his head to the side. The other bridgemen had lain down as well. Gaz\nwalked among the various crews, shaking his head, his shield on his back as\nhe muttered about their worthlessness.\nKaladin longed to lie there, staring at the sky, oblivious of the world.\nHis training, however, warned that might cause him to cramp up. That\nwould make the return trip even worse. That training…it belonged to\nanother man, from another time. Almost from the shadowdays. But while\nKaladin might not be him any longer, he could still heed him.\nAnd so, with a groan, Kaladin forced himself to sit up and begin\nrubbing his muscles. Soldiers crossed the bridge four across, spears held\nhigh, shields forward. Gaz watched them with obvious envy, and Kaladin’s\nwindspren danced around the man’s head. Despite his fatigue, Kaladin felt a\nmoment of jealousy. Why was she bothering that blowhard instead of\nKaladin?\nAfter a few minutes, Gaz noticed Kaladin and scowled at him.\n“He’s wondering why you aren’t lying down,” said a familiar voice.\nThe man who had been running beside Kaladin lay on the ground a short\ndistance away, staring up at the sky. He was older, with greying hair, and he\nhad a long, leathery face to complement his kindly voice. He looked as\nexhausted as Kaladin felt.\nKaladin kept rubbing his legs, pointedly ignoring Gaz. Then he ripped\noff some portions of his sacklike clothing and bound his feet and shoulders.\nFortunately, he was accustomed to walking barefoot as a slave, so the\ndamage wasn’t too bad.\nAs he finished, the last of the foot soldiers passed over the bridge.\nThey were followed by several mounted lighteyes in gleaming armor. At\ntheir center rode a man in majestic, burnished red Shardplate. It was distinct\nfrom the one other Kaladin had seen—each suit was said to be an individual"

        "text": "their center rode a man in majestic, burnished red Shardplate. It was distinct\nfrom the one other Kaladin had seen—each suit was said to be an individual\nwork of art—but it had the same feel. Ornate, interlocking, topped by a\nbeautiful helm with an open visor.\nThe armor felt alien somehow. It had been crafted in another epoch, a\ntime when gods had walked Roshar.\n“Is that the king?” Kaladin asked.\nThe leathery bridgeman laughed tiredly. “We could only wish.”\nKaladin turned toward him, frowning.\n“If that were the king,” the bridgeman said, “then that would mean we\nwere in Brightlord Dalinar’s army.”\nThe name was vaguely familiar to Kaladin. “He’s a highprince, right?\nThe king’s uncle?”\n“Aye. The best of men, the most honorable Shardbearer in the king’s\narmy. They say he’s never broken his word.”\nKaladin sniffed in disdain. Much the same had been said about\nAmaram.\n“You should wish to be in Highprince Dalinar’s force, lad,” the older\nman said. “He doesn’t use bridge crews. Not like these, at least.”\n“All right, you cremlings!” Gaz bellowed. “On your feet!”\nThe bridgemen groaned, stumbling upright. Kaladin sighed. The brief\nrest had been just enough to show how exhausted he was. “I’ll be glad to\nget back,” he muttered.\n“Back?” the leathery bridgeman said.\n“We aren’t turning around?”\nHis friend chuckled wryly. “Lad, we aren’t nearly there yet. Be glad\nwe aren’t. Arriving is the worst part.”\nAnd so the nightmare began its second phase. They crossed the bridge,\npulled it over behind them, then lifted it up on sore shoulders once more.\nThey jogged across the plateau. At the other side, they lowered the bridge\nagain to span another chasm. The army crossed, then it was back to carrying\nthe bridge again.\nThey repeated this a good dozen times. They did get to rest between\ncarries, but Kaladin was so sore and overworked that the brief respites\nweren’t enough. He barely caught his breath each time before being forced\nto pick up the bridge again.\nThey were expected to be quick about it. The bridgemen got to rest\nwhile the army crossed, but they had to make up the time by jogging across\nthe plateaus—passing the ranks of soldiers—so that they could arrive at the\nnext chasm before the army. At one point, his leathery-faced friend warned\nhim that if they didn’t have their bridge in place quickly enough, they’d be\npunished with whippings when they returned to camp.\nGaz gave orders, cursing the bridgemen, kicking them when they\nmoved too slowly, never doing any real work. It didn’t take long for\nKaladin to nurture a seething hatred of the scrawny, scarfaced man. That\nwas odd; he hadn’t felt hatred for his other sergeants. It was their job to\ncurse at the men and keep them motivated.\nThat wasn’t what burned Kaladin. Gaz had sent him on this trip\nwithout sandals or a vest. Despite his bandages, Kaladin would bear scars"

Despite his bandages, Kaladin would bear scars\nfrom his work this day. He’d be so bruised and stiff in the morning that he’d\nbe unable to walk.\nWhat Gaz had done was the mark of a petty bully. He risked the\nmission by losing a carrier, all because of a hasty grudge.\nStorming man, Kaladin thought, using his hatred of Gaz to sustain him\nthrough the ordeal. Several times after pushing the bridge into place,\nKaladin collapsed, feeling sure he’d never be able to stand again. But when\nGaz called for them to rise, Kaladin somehow struggled to his feet. It was\neither that or let Gaz win.\nWhy were they going through all of this? What was the point? Why\nwere they running so much? They had to protect their bridge, the precious\nweight, the cargo. They had to hold up the sky and run, they had to…\nHe was growing delirious. Feet, running. One, two, one, two, one, two.\n“Stop!”\nHe stopped.\n“Lift!”\nHe raised his hands up.\n“Drop!”\nHe stepped back, then lowered the bridge.\n“Push!”\nHe pushed the bridge.\nDie.\nThat last command was his own, added each time. He fell back to the\nstone, a rockbud hastily withdrawing its vines as he touched them. He\nclosed his eyes, no longer able to care about cramps. He entered a trance, a\nkind of half sleep, for what seemed like one heartbeat.\n“Rise!”\nHe stood, stumbling on bloody feet.\n“Cross!”\nHe crossed, not bothering to look at the deadly drop on either side.\n“Pull!”\nHe grabbed a handhold and pulled the bridge across the chasm after\nhim.\n“Switch!”\nKaladin stood up dumbly. He didn’t understand that command; Gaz\nhad never given it before. The troops were forming ranks, moving with that\nmixture of skittishness and forced relaxation that men often went through\nbefore a battle. A few anticipationspren—like red streamers, growing from\nthe ground and whipping in the wind—began to sprout from the rock and\nwave among the soldiers.\nA battle?\nGaz grabbed Kaladin’s shoulder and shoved him to the front of the\nbridge. “Newcomers get to go first at this part, Your Lordship.” The\nsergeant smiled wickedly.\nKaladin dumbly picked up the bridge with the others, raising it over\nhis head. The handholds were the same here, but this front row had a\nnotched opening before his face, allowing him to see out. All of the\nbridgemen had changed positions; the men who had been running in the\nfront moved to the back, and those at the back—including Kaladin and the\nleathery-faced bridgeman—moved to the front.\nKaladin didn’t ask the point of it.

Rockbuds were more common, growing like\nbubbles across the entire plateau, imitating rocks about the size of a man’s\nhead. Many of the buds were split, trailing out their vines like thick green\ntongues. A few were even in bloom.\nAfter so many hours breathing in the stuffy confines beneath the\nbridge, running in the front was almost relaxing. Why had they given such a\nwonderful position to a newcomer?\n“Talenelat’Elin, bearer of all agonies,” said the man to his right, voice\nhorrified. “It’s going to be a bad one. They’re already lined up! It’s going to\nbe a bad one!”\nKaladin blinked, focusing on the approaching chasm. On the other side\nof the rift stood a rank of men with marbled crimson and black skin. They\nwere wearing a strange rusty orange armor that covered their forearms,\nchests, heads, and legs. It took his numbed mind a moment to understand.\nThe Parshendi.\nThey weren’t like common parshman workers. They were far more\nmuscular, far more solid. They had the bulky build of soldiers, and each one\ncarried a weapon strapped to his back. Some wore dark red and black\nbeards tied with bits of rock, while others were clean-shaven.\nAs Kaladin watched, the front row of Parshendi knelt down. They held\nshortbows, arrows nocked. Not longbows intended to launch arrows high\nand far. Short, recurve bows to fire straight and quick and strong. An\nexcellent bow to use for killing a group of bridgemen before they could lay\ntheir bridge.\nArriving is the worst part….\nNow, finally, the real nightmare began.\nGaz hung back, bellowing at the bridge crews to keep going. Kaladin’s\ninstincts screamed at him to get out of the line of fire, but the momentum of\nthe bridge forced him forward. Forced him down the throat of the beast\nitself, its teeth poised to snap closed.\nKaladin’s exhaustion and pain fled. He was shocked alert. The bridges\ncharged forward, the men beneath them screaming as they ran. Ran toward\ndeath.\nThe archers released.\nThe first wave killed Kaladin’s leathery-faced friend, dropping him\nwith three separate arrows. The man to Kaladin’s left fell as well—Kaladin\nhadn’t even seen his face. That man cried out as he dropped, not dead\nimmediately, but the bridge crew trampled him. The bridge got noticeably\nheavier as men died.\nThe Parshendi calmly drew a second volley and launched. To the side,\nKaladin barely noticed another of the bridge crews floundering. The\nParshendi seemed to focus their fire on certain crews. That one got a full\nwave of arrows from dozens of archers, and the first three rows of\nbridgemen dropped and tripped those behind them. Their bridge lurched,\nskidding on the ground and making a sickening crunch as the mass of\nbodies fell over one another.\nArrows zipped past Kaladin, killing the other two men in the front line"

Several other arrows smacked into the wood around him, one\nslicing open the skin of his cheek.\nHe screamed. In horror, in shock, in pain, in sheer bewilderment.\nNever before had he felt so powerless in a battle. He’d charged enemy\nfortifications, he’d run beneath waves of arrows, but he’d always felt a\nmeasure of control. He’d had his spear, he’d had his shield, he could fight\nback.\nNot this time. The bridge crews were like hogs running to the\nslaughter.\nA third volley flew, and another of the twenty bridge crews fell. Waves\nof arrows came from the Alethi side as well, falling and striking the\nParshendi. Kaladin’s bridge was almost to the chasm. He could see the\nblack eyes of the Parshendi on the other side, could make out the features of\ntheir lean marbled faces. All around him, bridgemen were screaming in\npain, arrows cutting them out from underneath their bridges. There was a\ncrashing sound as another bridge dropped, its bridgemen slaughtered.\nBehind, Gaz called out. “Lift and down, you fools!”\nThe bridge crew lurched to a stop as the Parshendi launched another\nvolley. Men behind Kaladin screamed. The Parshendi firing was interrupted\nby a return volley from the Alethi army. Though he was shocked senseless,\nKaladin’s reflexes knew what do to. Drop the bridge, get into position to\npush.\nThis exposed the bridgemen who had been safe in the back ranks. The\nParshendi archers obviously knew this was coming; they prepared and\nlaunched one final volley. Arrows struck the bridge in a wave, dropping a\nhalf-dozen men, spraying blood across the dark wood. Fearspren—wiggling\nand violet—sprang up through the wood and wriggled in the air. The bridge\nlurched, growing much harder to push as they suddenly lost those men.\nKaladin stumbled, hands slipping. He fell to his knees and pitched out,\nleaning over the chasm. He barely managed to catch himself.\nHe teetered, one hand dangling above the void, the other gripping the\nedge. His overextended mind wavered with vertigo as he stared down that\nsheer cliff, down into darkness. The height was beautiful; he’d always loved\nclimbing high rock formations with Tien.\nBy reflex, he shoved himself back onto the plateau, scrambling\nbackward. A group of foot soldiers, protected by shields, had taken up\npositions pushing the bridge. The army’s archers exchanged arrows with the\nParshendi as the soldiers pushed the bridge into place and heavy cavalry\nthundered across, smashing into the Parshendi. Four bridges had fallen, but\nsixteen had been placed in a row, allowing for an effective charge.\nKaladin tried to move, tried to crawl away from the bridge. But he just\ncollapsed where he was, his body refusing to obey. He couldn’t even roll\nover onto his stomach.\nI should go… he thought in exhaustion. See if that leathery-faced man\nis still alive….

Couldn’t think. To his shame, he\njust let himself close his eyes and gave himself over to unconsciousness.\n“Kaladin.”\nHe didn’t want to open his eyes. To wake meant returning to that awful\nworld of pain. A world where defenseless, exhausted men were made to\ncharge lines of archers.\nThat world was the nightmare.\n“Kaladin!” The feminine voice was soft, like a whisper, yet still urgent.\n“They’re going to leave you. Get up! You’ll die!”\nI can’t…I can’t go back….\nLet me go.\nSomething snapped against his face, a slight slap of energy with a\nsting to it. He cringed. It was nothing compared with his other pains, but\nsomehow it was far more demanding. He raised a hand, swatting. The\nmotion was enough to drive away the last vestiges of stupor.\nHe tried to open his eyes. One refused, blood from a cut on his cheek\nhaving run down and crusted around the eyelid. The sun had moved. Hours\nhad passed. He groaned—sitting up, rubbing the dried blood from his eye.\nThe ground near him was littered with bodies. The air smelled of blood and\nworse.\nA pair of sorry bridgemen were shaking each man in turn, checking for\nlife, then pulling the vests and sandals off their bodies, shooing away the\ncremlings feeding on the bodies. The men would never have checked on\nKaladin. He didn’t have anything for them to take. They’d have left him\nwith the corpses, stranded on the plateau.\nKaladin’s windspren flitted through the air above him, moving\nanxiously. He rubbed his jaw where she’d struck him. Large spren like her\ncould move small objects and give little pinches of energy. That made them\nall the more annoying.\nThis time, it had probably saved Kaladin’s life. He groaned at all the\nplaces where he hurt. “Do you have a name, spirit?” he asked, forcing\nhimself to his battered feet.\nOn the plateau the army had crossed to, soldiers were picking through\nthe corpses of the dead Parshendi, looking for something. Harvesting\nequipment, maybe? It appeared that Sadeas’s force had won. At least, there\ndidn’t seem to be any Parshendi still alive. They’d either been killed or had\nfled.\nThe plateau they’d fought on seemed exactly like the others they’d\ncrossed. The only thing that was different here was that there was a large\nlump of…something in the center of the plateau. It looked like an enormous\nrockbud, perhaps some kind of chrysalis or shell, a good twenty feet tall.\nOne side had been hacked open, exposing slimy innards. He hadn’t noticed\nit on the initial charge; the archers had demanded all of his attention.\n“A name,” the windspren said, her voice distant. “Yes. I do have a\nname.” She seemed surprised as she looked at Kaladin. “Why do I have a\nname?”\n“How should I know?” Kaladin said, forcing himself to move. His feet\nblazed with pain. He could barely limp."

He could barely limp.\nThe nearby bridgemen looked to him with surprise, but he ignored\nthem, limping across the plateau until he found the corpse of a bridgeman\nwho still had his vest and shoes. It was the leathery-faced man who had\nbeen so kind to him, dead with an arrow through the neck. Kaladin ignored\nthose shocked eyes, staring blankly into the sky, and harvested the man’s\nclothing—leather vest, leather sandals, lacing shirt stained red with blood.\nKaladin felt disgusted with himself, but he wasn’t going to count on Gaz\ngiving him clothing.\nKaladin sat down and used the cleaner parts of the shirt to change his\nimprovised bandages, then put on the vest and sandals, trying to keep from\nmoving too much. A breeze now blew, carrying away the scents of blood\nand the sounds of soldiers calling to one another. The cavalry was already\nforming up, as if eager to return.\n“A name,” the windspren said, walking through the air to stand beside\nhis face. She was in the shape of a young woman, complete with flowing\nskirt and delicate feet. “Sylphrena.”\n“Sylphrena,” Kaladin repeated, tying on the sandals.\n“Syl,” the spirit said. She cocked her head. “That’s amusing. It appears\nthat I have a nickname.”\n“Congratulations.” Kaladin stood up again, wobbling.\nTo the side, Gaz stood with hands on hips, shield tied to his back.\n“You,” he said, pointing at Kaladin. He then gestured to the bridge.\n“You’ve got to be kidding,” Kaladin said, looking as the remnants of\nthe bridge crew—fewer than half of their previous number remained—\ngathered around the bridge.\n“Either carry or stay behind,” Gaz said. He seemed angry about\nsomething.\nI was supposed to die, Kaladin realized. That’s why he didn’t care if I\nhad a vest or sandals. I was at the front. Kaladin was the only one on the\nfirst row who had lived.\nKaladin nearly sat down and let them leave him. But dying of thirst on\na lonely plateau was not the way he’d choose to go. He stumbled over to the\nbridge.\n“Don’t worry,” said one of the other bridgemen. “They’ll let us go\nslow this time, take lots of breaks. And we’ll have a few soldiers to help—\ntakes at least twenty-five men to lift a bridge.”\nKaladin sighed, getting into place as some unfortunate soldiers joined\nthem. Together, they heaved the bridge into the air. It was terribly heavy,\nbut they managed it, somehow.\nKaladin walked, feeling numb. He’d thought that there was nothing\nmore life could do to him, nothing worse than the slave’s brand with a\nshash, nothing worse than losing all he had to the war, nothing more terrible\nthan failing those he’d sworn to protect.\nIt appeared that he’d been wrong. There had been something more\nthey could do to him. One final torment the world had reserved just for\nKaladin.\nAnd it was called Bridge Four."

Hopefully, the paintings on the walls hadn’t been\nruined.\nAhead, a small group of parshmen arrived, bearing rags, buckets, and\nstepladders to use in wiping off the soot. They bowed to her as she passed,\nuttering no words. Parshmen could speak, but they rarely did so. Many\nseemed mute. As a child, she’d found the patterns of their marbled skin\nbeautiful. That had been before her father forbade her to spend any time\nwith the parshmen.\nShe turned her mind to her task. How was she going to convince\nJasnah Kholin, one of the most powerful women in the world, to change her\nmind about taking Shallan as a ward? The woman was obviously stubborn;\nshe had spent years resisting the devotaries’ attempts at reconciliation.\nShe reentered the broad main cavern, with its lofty stone ceiling and\nbustling, well-dressed occupants. She felt daunted, but that brief glimpse of\nthe Soulcaster seduced her. Her family, House Davar, had prospered in\nrecent years, coming out of obscurity. This had primarily been because of\nher father’s skill in politics—he had been hated by many, but his\nruthlessness had carried him far. So had the wealth lent by the discovery of\nseveral important new marble deposits on Davar lands.\nShallan had never known enough to be suspicious of that wealth’s\norigins. Every time the family had exhausted one of its quarries, her father\nhad gone out with his surveyor and discovered a new one. Only after\ninterrogating the surveyor had Shallan and her brothers discovered the\ntruth: Her father, using his forbidden Soulcaster, had been creating new\ndeposits at a careful rate. Not enough to be suspicious. Just enough to give\nhim the money he needed to further his political goals.\nNobody knew where he’d gotten the fabrial, which she now carried in\nher safepouch. It was unusable, damaged on the same disastrous evening\nthat her father had died. Don’t think about that, she told herself forcefully.\nThey’d had a jeweler repair the broken Soulcaster, but it no longer\nworked. Their house steward—one of her father’s close confidants, an\nadvisor named Luesh—had been trained to use the device, and he could no\nlonger make it function.\nHer father’s debts and promises were outrageous. Their choices were\nlimited. Her family had some time—perhaps as long as a year—before the\nmissed payments became egregious, and before her father’s absence\nbecame obvious. For once, her family’s isolated, backcountry estates were\nan advantage, providing a reason that communications were being delayed."

Find Jasnah\nKholin. Become her ward. Learn where she kept her Soulcaster. Then\nreplace it with the nonfunctional one.\nWith the fabrial, they’d be able to make new quarries and restore their\nwealth. They’d be able to make food to feed their house soldiers. With\nenough wealth in hand to pay off debts and make bribes, they could\nannounce their father’s death and not suffer destruction.\nShallan hesitated in the main hallway, considering her next move.\nWhat she planned to do was very risky. She’d have to escape without\nimplicating herself in the theft. Though she’d devoted much thought to that,\nshe still didn’t know how she’d manage it. But Jasnah was known to have\nmany enemies. There had to be a way to pin the fabrial’s “breaking” on\nthem instead.\nThat step would come later. For now, Shallan had to convince Jasnah\nto accept her as a ward. All other results were unacceptable.\nNervously, Shallan held her arms in the sign of need, covered safehand\nbent across her chest and touching the elbow of her freehand, which was\nraised with fingers outspread. A woman approached, wearing the well-\nstarched white laced shirt and black skirt that were the universal sign of a\nmaster-servant.\nThe stout woman curtsied. “Brightness?”\n“The Palanaeum,” Shallan said.\nThe woman bowed and led Shallan farther into the depths of the long\nhallway. Most of the women here—servants included—wore their hair\nbound, and Shallan felt conspicuous with hers loose. The deep red color\nmade her stand out even more.\nSoon, the grand hallway began to slope down steeply. But when the\nhalf-hour arrived, she could still hear distant bells ring behind her. Perhaps\nthat was why the people here liked them so much; even in the depths of the\nConclave, one could hear the outside world.\nThe servant led Shallan to a pair of grand steel doors. The servant\nbowed and Shallan dismissed her with a nod.\nShallan couldn’t help but admire the beauty of the doors; their exterior\nwas carved in an intricate geometric pattern with circles and lines and\nglyphs. It was some kind of chart, half on each door. There was no time to\nstudy the details, unfortunately, and she passed them by.\nBeyond the doors was a breathtakingly large room. The sides were of\nsmooth rock and they stretched high; the dim illumination made it\nimpossible to tell just how high, but she saw flickers of distant light. Set\ninto the walls were dozens of small balconies, much like the private box\nseats of a theater. Soft light shone from many of these. The only sounds\nwere turning pages and faint whispers. Shallan raised her safehand to her\nbreast, feeling dwarfed by the magnificent chamber.\n“Brightness?” a young male master-servant said, approaching. “What\ndo you need?”"

Both were here when the city was\nfounded. Some think these chambers might have been cut by the\nDawnsingers themselves.”\n“Where are the books?”\n“The Palanaeum proper is this way.” The servant gestured, leading her\nto a set of doors on the other side of the room. Through them, she entered a\nsmaller chamber that was partitioned with walls of thick crystal. Shallan\napproached the nearest one, feeling it. The crystal’s surface was rough like\nhewn rock.\n“Soulcast?” she asked.\nThe servant nodded. Behind him, another servant passed leading an\nelderly ardent. Like most ardents, the aged man had a shaved head and a\nlong beard. His simple grey robes were tied with a brown sash. The servant\nled him around a corner, and Shallan could vaguely make out their shapes\non the other side, shadows swimming through the crystal.\nShe took a step forward, but her servant cleared his throat. “I will need\nyour chit of admittance, Brightness.”\n“How much does one cost?” Shallan asked hesitantly.\n“A thousand sapphire broams.”\n“So much?”\n“The king’s many hospitals require much upkeep,” the man said\napologetically. “The only things Kharbranth has to sell are fish, bells, and\ninformation. The first two are hardly unique to us. But the third…well, the\nPalanaeum has the finest collection of tomes and scrolls on Roshar. More,\neven, than the Holy Enclave in Valath. At last count, there were over seven\nhundred thousand separate texts in our archive.”\nHer father had owned exactly eighty-seven books. Shallan had read\nthem all several times over. How much could be contained in seven hundred\nthousand books? The weight of that much information dazzled her. She\nfound herself hungering to look through those hidden shelves. She could\nspend months just reading their titles.\nBut no. Perhaps once she’d made certain her brothers were safe—once\nher house’s finances were restored—she could return. Perhaps.\nShe felt like she was starving, yet leaving a warm fruit pie uneaten.\n“Where might I wait?” she asked. “If someone I know is inside.”\n“You may use one of the reading alcoves,” the servant said, relaxing.\nPerhaps he’d feared that she would make a scene. “No chit is required to sit\nin one. There are parshman porters who will raise you to the higher levels,\nif that is what you wish.”\n“Thank you,” Shallan said, turning her back on the Palanaeum. She\nfelt like a child again, locked in her room, not allowed to run through the\ngardens because of her father’s paranoid fears. “Does Brightness Jasnah\nhave an alcove yet?”\n“I can ask,” the servant said, leading the way back into the Veil, with\nits distant, unseen ceiling. He hurried off to speak with some others, leaving"

        "text": "have an alcove yet?”\n“I can ask,” the servant said, leading the way back into the Veil, with\nits distant, unseen ceiling. He hurried off to speak with some others, leaving\nShallan standing beside the doorway to the Palanaeum.\nShe could run in. Sneak through—\nNo. Her brothers teased her for being too timid, but it was not timidity\nthat held her back. There would undoubtedly be guards; bursting in would\nnot only be futile, it would ruin any chance she had of changing Jasnah’s\nmind.\nChange Jasnah’s mind, prove herself. Considering it made her sick.\nShe hated confrontation. During her youth, she’d felt like a piece of delicate\ncrystalware, locked in a cabinet to be displayed but never touched. The only\ndaughter, the last memory of Brightlord Davar’s beloved wife. It still felt\nodd to her that she been the one to take charge after…After the incident…\nAfter…\nMemories attacked her. Nan Balat bruised, his coat torn. A long,\nsilvery sword in her hand, sharp enough to cut stones as if they were water.\nNo, Shallan thought, her back to the stone wall, clutching her satchel.\nNo. Don’t think of the past.\nShe sought solace in drawing, raising fingers to her satchel and\nreaching for her paper and pencils. The servant came back before she had a\nchance to get them out, however. “Brightness Jasnah Kholin has indeed\nasked that a reading alcove be set aside for her,” he said. “You may wait\nthere for her, if you wish it.”\n“I do,” Shallan said. “Thank you.”\nThe servant led her to a shadowed enclosure, inside of which four\nparshmen stood upon a sturdy wooden platform. The servant and Shallan\nstepped onto the platform, and the parshmen pulled ropes that were strung\ninto a pulley above, raising the platform up the stone shaft. The only lights\nwere broam spheres set at each corner of the lift’s ceiling. Amethysts, which\nhad a soft violet light.\nShe needed a plan. Jasnah Kholin did not seem the type to change her\nmind easily. Shallan would have to surprise her, impress her.\nThey reached a level about forty feet or so off the ground, and the\nservant waved for the porters to stop. Shallan followed the master-servant\ndown a dark hallway to one of the small balconies that extended out over\nthe Veil. It was round, like a turret, and had a waist-high stone rim with a\nwooden railing above that. Other occupied alcoves glowed with different\ncolors from the spheres being used to light them; the darkness of the huge\nspace made them seem to hover in the air.\nThis alcove had a long, curving stone desk joined directly into the rim\nof the balcony. There was a single chair and a gobletlike crystal bowl.\nShallan nodded in thanks to the servant, who withdrew, then she pulled out\na handful of spheres and dropped them into the bowl, lighting the alcove.\nShe sighed, sitting down in the chair and laying her satchel on the\ndesk. She undid the laces on her satchel, busying herself as she tried to\nthink of something—anything—that would persuade Jasnah."

        "text": "desk. She undid the laces on her satchel, busying herself as she tried to\nthink of something—anything—that would persuade Jasnah.\nFirst, she decided, I need to clear my mind.\nFrom her satchel she removed a sheaf of thick drawing paper, a set of\ncharcoal pencils of different widths, some brushes and steel pens, ink, and\nwatercolors. Finally, she took out her smaller notebook, bound in codex\nform, which contained the nature sketches she’d done during her weeks\naboard the Wind’s pleasure.\nThese were simple things, really, but worth more to her than a chest\nfull of spheres. She took a sheet off the stack, then selected a fine-pointed\ncharcoal pencil, rolling it between her fingers. She closed her eyes and fixed\nan image in her mind: Kharbranth as she’d memorized it in that moment\nsoon after landing on the docks. Waves surging against the wooden posts, a\nsalty scent to the air, men climbing rigging calling one another with\nexcitement. And the city itself, rising up the hillside, homes stacked atop\nhomes, not a speck of land wasted. Bells, distant, tinkling softly in the air.\nShe opened her eyes and began to draw. Her fingers moved on their\nown, sketching broad lines first. The cracklike valley the city was situated\nin. The port. Here, squares to be homes, there a slash to mark a switchback\nof the grand roadway that led up to the Conclave. Slowly, bit by bit, she\nadded detail. Shadows as windows. Lines to fill out the roadways. Hints of\npeople and carts to show the chaos of the thoroughfares.\nShe had read of how sculptors worked. Many would take a blank stone\nblock and work it into a vague shape first. Then, they’d work it over again,\ncarving more detail with each pass. It was the same for her in drawing.\nBroad lines first, then some details, then more, then down to the finest of\nlines. She had no formal training in pencils; she simply did what felt right.\nThe city took shape beneath her fingers. She coaxed it free, line by\nline, scratch by scratch. What would she do without this? Tension bled from\nher body, as if released from her fingertips into the pencil.\nShe lost track of time as she worked. Sometimes she felt like she was\nentering a trance, everything else fading. Her fingers almost seemed to draw\nof their own accord. It was so much easier to think while drawing.\nBefore too long, she had copied her Memory onto the page. She held\nup the sheet, satisfied, relaxed, her mind clear. The memorized image of\nKharbranth was gone from her head; she’d released it into her sketch. There\nwas a sense of relaxation to that too. As if her mind was put under tension\nholding Memories until they could be used.\nShe did Yalb next, standing shirtless in his vest and gesturing to the\nshort porter who had pulled her up to the Conclave. She smiled as she\nworked, remembering Yalb’s affable voice. He’d likely returned to the\nWind’s Pleasure by now. Had it been two hours? Probably.\nShe was always more excited by drawing animals and people than she\nwas by drawing things. There was something energizing about putting a"

        "text": "Wind’s Pleasure by now. Had it been two hours? Probably.\nShe was always more excited by drawing animals and people than she\nwas by drawing things. There was something energizing about putting a\nliving creature onto the page. A city was lines and boxes, but a person was\ncircles and curves. Could she get that smirk on Yalb’s face right? Could she\nshow his lazy contentedness, the way he would flirt with a woman far above\nhis station? And the porter, with his thin fingers and sandaled feet, his long\ncoat and baggy pants. His strange language, his keen eyes, his plan to\nincrease his tip by offering not just a ride, but a tour.\nWhen she drew, she didn’t feel as if she worked with only charcoal and\npaper. In drawing a portrait, her medium was the soul itself. There were\nplants from which one could remove a tiny cutting—a leaf, or a bit of stem\n—then plant it and grow a duplicate. When she collected a Memory of a\nperson, she was snipping free a bud of their soul, and she cultivated and\ngrew it on the page. Charcoal for sinew, paper pulp for bone, ink for blood,\nthe paper’s texture for skin. She fell into a rhythm, a cadence, the scratching\nof her pencil like the sound of breathing from those she depicted.\nCreationspren began to gather around her pad, looking at her work.\nLike other spren, they were said to always be around, but usually invisible.\nSometimes you attracted them. Sometimes you didn’t. With drawing, skill\nseemed to make a difference.\nCreationspren were of medium size, as tall as one of her fingers, and\nthey glowed with a faint silvery light. They transformed perpetually, taking\nnew shapes. Usually the shapes were things they had seen recently. An urn,\na person, a table, a wheel, a nail. Always of the same silvery color, always\nthe same diminutive height. They imitated shapes exactly, but moved them\nin strange ways. A table would roll like a wheel, an urn would shatter and\nrepair itself.\nHer drawing gathered about a half-dozen of them, pulling them by her\nact of creation just as a bright fire would draw flamespren. She’d learned to\nignore them. They weren’t substantial—if she moved her arm through one,\nits figure would smear like scattered sand, then reform. She never felt a\nthing when touching one.\nEventually, she held up the page, satisfied. It depicted Yalb and the\nporter in detail, with hints of the busy city behind. She’d gotten their eyes\nright. That was the most important. Each of the Ten Essences had an\nanalogous part of the human body—blood for liquid, hair for wood, and so\nforth. The eyes were associated with crystal and glass. The windows into a\nperson’s mind and spirit.\nShe set the page aside. Some men collected trophies. Others collected\nweapons or shields. Many collected spheres.\nShallan collected people. People, and interesting creatures. Perhaps it\nwas because she’d spent so much of her youth in a virtual prison. She’d\ndeveloped the habit of memorizing faces, then drawing them later, after her\nfather had discovered her sketching the gardeners. His daughter? Drawing\npictures of darkeyes?

He’d been furious with her—one of the infrequent\ntimes he’d directed his infamous temper at his daughter.\nAfter that, she’d done drawings of people only when in private, instead\nusing her open drawing times to sketch the insects, crustaceans, and plants\nof the manor gardens. Her father hadn’t minded this—zoology and botany\nwere proper feminine pursuits—and had encouraged her to choose natural\nhistory as her Calling.\nShe took out a third blank sheet. It seemed to beg her to fill it. A blank\npage was nothing but potential, pointless until it was used. Like a fully\ninfused sphere cloistered inside a pouch, prevented from making its light\nuseful.\nFill me.\nThe creationspren gathered around the page. They were still, as if\ncurious, anticipatory. Shallan closed her eyes and imagined Jasnah Kholin,\nstanding before the blocked door, the Soulcaster glowing on her hand. The\nhallway hushed, save for a child’s sniffles. Attendants holding their breath.\nAn anxious king. A still reverence.\nShallan opened her eyes and began to draw with vigor, intentionally\nlosing herself. The less she was in the now and the more she was in the\nthen, the better the sketch would be. The other two pictures had been warm-\nups; this was the day’s masterpiece. With the paper bound onto the board—\nsafehand holding that—her freehand flew across the page, occasionally\nswitching to other pencils. Soft charcoal for deep, thick blackness, like\nJasnah’s beautiful hair. Hard charcoal for light greys, like the powerful\nwaves of light coming from the Soulcaster’s gems.\nFor a few extended moments, Shallan was back in that hallway again,\nwatching something that should not be: a heretic wielding one of the most\nsacred powers in all the world. The power of change itself, the power by\nwhich the Almighty had created Roshar. He had another name, allowed to\npass only the lips of ardents. Elithanathile. He Who Transforms.\nShallan could smell the musty hallway. She could hear the child\nwhimpering. She could feel her own heart beating in anticipation. The\nboulder would soon change. Sucking away the Stormlight in Jasnah’s\ngemstone, it would give up its essence, becoming something new. Shallan’s\nbreath caught in her throat.\nAnd then the memory faded, returning her to the quiet, dim alcove.\nThe page now held a perfect rendition of the scene, worked in blacks and\ngreys. The princess’s proud figure regarded the fallen stone, demanding that\nit give way before her will. It was her. Shallan knew, with the intuitive\ncertainty of an artist, that this was one of the finest pieces she had ever\ndone. In a very small way, she had captured Jasnah Kholin, something the\ndevotaries had never managed. That gave her a euphoric thrill. Even if this\nwoman rejected Shallan again, one fact would not change. Jasnah Kholin\nhad joined Shallan’s collection.\nShallan wiped her fingers on her cleaning cloth, then lifted the paper."

        "text": "woman rejected Shallan again, one fact would not change. Jasnah Kholin\nhad joined Shallan’s collection.\nShallan wiped her fingers on her cleaning cloth, then lifted the paper.\nShe noted absently that she’d attracted some two dozen creationspren now.\nShe would have to lacquer the page with plytree sap to set the charcoal and\nprotect it from smudges. She had some in her satchel. First she wanted to\nstudy the page and the figure it contained. Who was Jasnah Kholin? Not one\nto be cowed, certainly. She was a woman to the bone, master of the\nfeminine arts, but not by any means delicate.\nSuch a woman would appreciate Shallan’s determination. She would\nlisten to another request for wardship, assuming it was presented properly.\nJasnah was also a rationalist, a woman with the audacity to deny the\nexistence of the Almighty himself based on her own reasoning. Jasnah\nwould appreciate strength, but only if it was shaped by logic.\nShallan nodded to herself, taking out a fourth sheet of paper and a fine-\ntipped brushpen, then shaking and opening her jar of ink. Jasnah had\ndemanded proof of Shallan’s logical and writing skills. Well, what better\nway to do that than to supplicate the woman with words?\nBrightness Jasnah Kholin, Shallan wrote, painting the letters as neatly\nand beautifully as she could. She could have used a reed instead, but a\nbrushpen was for works of art. She intended this page to be just that. You\nhave rejected my petition. I accept that. Yet, as anyone trained in formal\ninquiry knows, no supposition should be treated as axiomatic. The actual\nargument usually read “no supposition—save for the existence of the\nAlmighty himself—should be held as axiomatic.” But this wording would\nappeal to Jasnah.\nA scientist must be willing to change her theories if experiment\ndisproves them. I hold to the hope that you treat decisions in a like manner:\nas preliminary results pending further information.\nFrom our brief interaction, I can see that you appreciate tenacity. You\ncomplimented me on continuing to seek you out. Therefore, I presume that\nyou will not find this letter a breach of good taste. Take it as proof of my\nardor to be your ward, and not as disdain for your expressed decision.\nShallan raised the end of her brushpen to her lips as she considered her\nnext step. The creationspren slowly faded away, vanishing. There were said\nto be logicspren—in the form of tiny stormclouds—who were attracted to\ngreat arguments, but Shallan had never seen them.\nYou expect proof of my worthiness, Shallan continued. I wish I could\ndemonstrate that my schooling is more complete than our interview\nrevealed. Unfortunately, I haven’t the grounds for such an argument. I have\nweaknesses in my understanding. That is plain and not subject to\nreasonable dispute.\nBut the lives of men and women are more than logical puzzles; the\ncontext of their experiences is invaluable in making good decisions. My\nstudy in logic does not rise to your standards, but even I know that the\nrationalists have a rule: One cannot apply logic as an absolute where\nhuman beings are concerned. We are not beings of thought only."

We are not beings of thought only.\nTherefore, the soul of my argument here is to give perspective on my\nignorance. Not by way of excuse, but of explanation. You expressed\ndispleasure that one such as I should be trained so inadequately. What of\nmy stepmother? What of my tutors? Why was my education handled so\npoorly?\nThe facts are embarrassing. I have had few tutors and virtually no\neducation. My stepmother tried, but she had no education herself. It is a\ncarefully guarded secret, but many of the rural Veden houses ignore the\nproper training of their women.\nI had three different tutors when I was very young, but each left after a\nfew months, citing my father’s temper or rudeness as her reason. I was left\nto my own devices in education. I have learned what I could through\nreading, filling in the gaps by taking advantage of my own curious nature.\nBut I will not be capable of matching knowledge with someone who has\nbeen given the benefit of a formal—and expensive—education.\nWhy is this an argument that you should accept me? Because\neverything I have learned has come by way of great personal struggle.\nWhat others were handed, I had to hunt. I believe that because of this, my\neducation—limited though it is—has extra worth and merit. I respect your\ndecisions, but I do ask you to reconsider. Which would you rather have? A\nward who is able to repeat the correct answers because an overpriced tutor\ndrilled them into her, or a ward who had to struggle and fight for everything\nshe has learned?\nI assure you that one of those two will prize your teachings far more\nthan the other.\nShe raised her brush. Her arguments seemed imperfect now that she\nconsidered them. She exposed her ignorance, then expected Jasnah to\nwelcome her? Still, it seemed the right thing to do, for all the fact that this\nletter was a lie. A lie built of truths. She hadn’t truly come to partake of\nJasnah’s knowledge. She had come as a thief.\nThat made her conscience itch, and she nearly reached out and\ncrumpled the page. Steps in the hallway outside made her freeze. She\nleaped to her feet, spinning, safehand held to her breast. She fumbled for\nwords to explain her presence to Jasnah Kholin.\nLight and shadows flickered in the hallway, then a figure hesitantly\nlooked into the alcove, a single white sphere cupped in one hand for light. It\nwas not Jasnah. It was a man in his early twenties wearing simple grey\nrobes. An ardent. Shallan relaxed.\nThe young man noticed her. His face was narrow, his blue eyes keen.\nHis beard was trimmed short and square, his head shaved. When he spoke,\nhis voice had a cultured tone. “Ah, excuse me, Brightness. I thought this\nwas the alcove of Jasnah Kholin.”\n“It is,” Shallan said.\n“Oh. You’re waiting for her too?”\n“Yes.”\n“Would you mind terribly if I waited with you?” He had a faint\nHerdazian accent.\n“Of course not, Ardent.” She nodded her head in respect, then gathered"

I’ll fetch another for myself.”\nShe raised a hand in protest, but he had already retreated. He returned\na few moments later, carrying a chair from another alcove. He was tall and\nlean, and—she decided with slight discomfort—rather handsome. Her\nfather had owned only three ardents, all elderly men. They had traveled his\nlands and visited the villages, ministering to the people, helping them reach\nPoints in their Glories and Callings. She had their faces in her collection of\nportraits.\nThe ardent set down his chair. He hesitated before sitting, glancing at\nthe table. “My, my,” he said in surprise.\nFor a moment, Shallan thought he was reading her letter, and she felt\nan irrational surge of panic. The ardent, however, was regarding the three\ndrawings that lay at the head of the table, awaiting lacquer.\n“You did these, Brightness?” he said.\n“Yes, Ardent,” Shallan said, lowering her eyes.\n“No need to be so formal!” the ardent said, leaning down and adjusting\nhis spectacles as he studied her work. “Please, I am Brother Kabsal, or just\nKabsal. Really, it’s fine. And you are?”\n“Shallan Davar.”\n“By Vedeledev’s golden keys, Brightness!” Brother Kabsal said,\nseating himself. “Did Jasnah Kholin teach you this skill with the pencil?”\n“No, Ardent,” she said, still standing.\n“Still so formal,” he said, smiling at her. “Tell me, am I so intimidating\nas that?”\n“I have been brought up to show respect to ardents.”\n“Well, I myself find that respect is like manure. Use it where needed,\nand growth will flourish. Spread it on too thick, and things just start to\nsmell.” His eyes twinkled.\nHad an ardent—a servant of the Almighty—just spoken of manure?\n“An ardent is a representative of the Almighty himself,” she said. “To show\nyou lack of respect would be to show it to the Almighty.”\n“I see. And this is how you’d respond if the Almighty himself appeared\nto you here? All of this formality and bowing?”\nShe hesitated. “Well, no.”\n“Ah, and how would you react?”\n“I suspect with screams of pain,” she said, letting her thought slip out\ntoo easily. “As it is written that the Almighty’s glory is such that any who\nlook upon him would immediately be burned to ash.”\nThe ardent laughed at that. “Wisely spoken indeed. Please, do sit,\nthough.”\nShe did so, hesitant.\n“You still appear conflicted,” he said, holding up her portrait of Jasnah.\n“What must I do to put you at ease? Shall I step up onto this desk here and\ndo a jig?”\nShe blinked in surprise.\n“No objection?” Brother Kabsal said. “Well, then…” He set down the\nportrait and began to climb up on his chair.\n“No, please!” Shallan said, holding out her freehand."

He leaned closer to\nher, as if conspiratorially. “The table jig threat almost always works. I’ve\nonly ever had to go through with it once, due to a lost bet against Brother\nLhanin. The master ardent of our monastery nearly keeled over in shock.”\nShallan found herself smiling. “You’re an ardent; you’re forbidden to\nhave possessions. What did you bet?”\n“Two deep breaths of a winter rose’s fragrance,” said Brother Kabsal,\n“and the sunlight’s warmth on your skin.” He smiled. “We can be rather\ncreative at times. Years spent marinating in a monastery can do that to a\nman. Now, you were about to explain to me where you learned such skill\nwith a pencil.”\n“Practice,” Shallan said. “I should suspect that is how everyone learns,\neventually.”\n“Wise words again. I am beginning to wonder which of us it the\nardent. But surely you had a master to teach you.”\n“Dandos the Oilsworn.”\n“Ah, a true master of pencils if there ever was one. Now, not that I\ndoubt your word, Brightness, but I’m rather intrigued how Dandos Heraldin\ncould have trained you in arts, as—last I checked—he’s suffering a rather\nterminal and perpetual ailment. Namely, that of being dead. For three\nhundred years.”\nShallan blushed. “My father had a book of his instruction.”\n“You learned this,” Kabsal said, lifting up her drawing of Jasnah,\n“from a book.”\n“Er…yes?”\nHe looked back at the picture. “I need to read more.”\nShallan found herself laughing at the ardent’s expression, and she took\na Memory of him sitting there, admiration and perplexity blending on his\nface as he studied the picture, rubbing his bearded chin with one finger.\nHe smiled pleasantly, setting down the picture. “You have lacquer?”\n“I do,” she said, getting it out of her satchel. It was contained in a bulb\nsprayer of the type often used for perfume.\nHe accepted the small jar and twisted the clasp on the front, then gave\nthe bottle a shake and tested the lacquer on the back of his hand. He nodded\nin satisfaction and reached for the drawing. “A piece such as this should not\nbe allowed to risk smudging.”\n“I can lacquer it,” Shallan said. “No need to trouble yourself.”\n“It is no trouble; it’s an honor. Besides, I am an ardent. We don’t know\nwhat to do with ourselves when we aren’t busying about, doing things\nothers could do for themselves. It is best just to humor me.” He began to\napply the lacquer, dusting the page with careful puffs."

Fortunately, his hands were careful, and the lacquer went on evenly.\nHe’d obviously done this before.\n“You are from Jah Keved, I presume?” he asked.\n“From the hair?” she asked, raising a hand to her red locks. “Or from\nthe accent?”\n“From the way you treat ardents. The Veden Church is by far the most\ntraditional.

I would hate to\nhave that on my conscience. The Almighty is not kind toward those who kill\nhis priests.”\n“I should think that killing in general would be frowned upon,” she\nresponded, still watching him apply the lacquer. It felt odd to let someone\nelse work on her art.\n“What does Brightness Jasnah think of your skill?” he asked as he\nworked.\n“I don’t think she cares,” Shallan said, grimacing and remembering her\nconversation with the woman. “She doesn’t seem terribly appreciative of\nthe visual arts.”\n“So I have heard. It’s one of her few faults, unfortunately.”\n“Another being that little matter of her heresy?”\n“Indeed,” Kabsal said, smiling. “I must admit, I stepped in here\nexpecting indifference, not deference. How did you come to be part of her\nentourage?”\nShallan started, realizing for the first time that Brother Kabsal must\nhave assumed her to be one of the Brightlady Kholin’s attendants. Perhaps a\nward.\n“Bother,” she said to herself.\n“Hum?”\n“It appears I’ve inadvertently misled you, Brother Kabsal. I’m not\nassociated with Brightness Jasnah. Not yet, anyway. I’ve been trying to get\nher to take me on as a ward.”\n“Ah,” he said, finishing his lacquering.\n“I’m sorry.”\n“For what? You did nothing wrong.” He blew on the picture, then\nturned it for her to see. It was perfectly lacquered, without any smears. “If\nyou would do me a favor, child?” he said, setting the page aside.\n“Anything.”\nHe raised an eyebrow at that.\n“Anything reasonable,” she corrected.\n“By whose reason?”\n“Mine, I guess.”\n“Pity,” he said, standing. “Then I will limit myself. If you would\nkindly let Brightness Jasnah know that I called upon her?”\n“She knows you?” What business had a Herdazian ardent with Jasnah,\na confirmed atheist?\n“Oh, I wouldn’t say that,” he replied. “I’d hope she’s heard my name,\nthough, since I’ve requested an audience with her several times.”\nShallan nodded, rising. “You want to try to convert her, I presume?”"

I don’t think I could live with myself\nif I didn’t at least try to persuade her.”\n“And we wouldn’t want you to be unable to live with yourself,”\nShallan noted, “as the alternative harks back to your nasty habit of almost\nkilling ardents.”\n“Exactly. Anyway, I think a personal message from you might help\nwhere written requests have been ignored.”\n“I…doubt that.”\n“Well, if she refuses, it only means that I’ll be back.” He smiled. “That\nwould mean—hopefully—that we shall meet each other again. So I look\nforward to it.”\n“I as well. And I’m sorry again about the misunderstanding.”\n“Brightness! Please. Don’t take responsibility for my assumptions.”\nShe smiled. “I should hesitate to take responsibility for you in any\nmanner or regard, Brother Kabsal. But I still feel bad.”\n“It will pass,” he noted, blue eyes twinkling. “But I’ll do my best to\nmake you feel well again. Is there anything you’re fond of? Other than\nrespecting ardents and drawing amazing pictures, that is?”\n“Jam.”\nHe cocked his head.\n“I like it,” she said, shrugging. “You asked what I was fond of. Jam.”\n“So it shall be.” He withdrew into the dark corridor, fishing in his robe\npocket for his sphere to give him light. In moments, he was gone.\nWhy didn’t he wait for Jasnah to return himself? Shallan shook her\nhead, then lacquered her other two pictures. She had just finished letting\nthem dry—packing them in her satchel—when she heard footsteps in the\nhallway again and recognized Jasnah’s voice speaking.\nShallan hurriedly gathered her things, leaving the letter on the desk,\nthen stepped up to the side of the alcove to wait. Jasnah Kholin entered a\nmoment later, accompanied by a small group of servants.\nShe did not look pleased.\n“Victory! We stand atop the mount! We scatter them before us! Their\nhomes become our dens, their lands are now our farms! And they shall\nburn, as we once did, in a place that is hollow and forlorn.”\n—Collected on Ishashan, 1172, 18 seconds pre-death. Subject was a\nlighteyed spinster of the eighth dahn.\nShallan’s fears were confirmed as Jasnah looked straight at her, then\nlowered her safehand to her side in a mark of frustration. “So you are here.”\nShallan cringed. “The servants told you, then?”\n“You didn’t think that they would leave someone in my alcove and not\nwarn me?” Behind Jasnah, a small group of parshmen hesitated in the\nhallway, each carrying an armload of books.\n“Brightness Kholin,” Shallan said. “I just—”\n“I have wasted enough time on you already,” Jasnah said, eyes furious.\n“You will withdraw, Miss Davar.

There was a gravity to\nJasnah Kholin. One did not disobey her. One need only look into those eyes\nto understand.\n“I’m sorry to have bothered you,” Shallan whispered, clutching her\nsatchel and leaving with as much dignity as she could manage. She barely\nkept the tears of embarrassment and disappointment from her eyes as she\nhastened down the hallway, feeling like a complete fool.\nShe reached the porter’s shaft, though they had already returned below\nafter bringing up Jasnah. Shallan didn’t pull the bell to summon them.\nInstead she placed her back to the wall and sank down to the floor, knees up\nagainst her chest, satchel in her lap. She wrapped her arms around her legs,\nfreehand clasping her safehand through the fabric of her cuff, breathing\nquietly.\nAngry people unsettled her. She couldn’t help but think of her father in\none of his tirades, couldn’t help but hear screams, bellows, and whimpers.\nWas she weak because confrontation unsettled her so? She felt that she was.\nFoolish, idiot girl, she thought, a few painspren crawling out of the\nwall near her head. What made you think you could do this? You’ve only set\nfoot off your family grounds a half-dozen times during your life. Idiot, idiot,\nidiot!\nShe had persuaded her brothers to trust her, to put hope in her\nridiculous plan. And now what had she done? Wasted six months during\nwhich their enemies circled closer.\n“Brightness Davar?” asked a hesitant voice.\nShallan looked up, realizing she’d been so wrapped in her misery that\nshe hadn’t seen the servant approach. He was a younger man, wearing an all\nblack uniform, no emblem on the breast. Not a master-servant, but perhaps\none in training.\n“Brightness Kholin would like to speak with you.” The young man\ngestured back down the hallway.\nTo berate me further? Shallan thought with a grimace. But a highlady\nlike Jasnah got what she wanted. Shallan forced herself to stop shaking,\nthen stood. At least she’d been able to keep the tears away; she hadn’t\nruined her makeup. She followed the servant back to the lit alcove, satchel\nclutched before her like a shield on the battlefield.\nJasnah Kholin sat in the chair Shallan had been using, stacks of books\non the table. Jasnah was rubbing her forehead with her freehand. The\nSoulcaster rested against the back of her skin, the smokestone dark and\ncracked. Though Jasnah looked fatigued, she sat with perfect posture, her\nfine silk dress covering her feet, her safehand held across her lap.\nJasnah focused on Shallan, lowering her freehand. “I should not have\ntreated you with such anger, Miss Davar,” she said in a tired voice. “You\nwere simply showing persistence, a trait I normally encourage.

Sometimes we find it\nhardest to accept in others that which we cling to in ourselves. My only\nexcuse can be that I have put myself under an unusual amount of strain\nlately.”\nShallan nodded in gratitude, though she felt terribly awkward.\nJasnah turned to look out of the balcony into the dark space of the Veil.\n“I know what people say of me. I should hope that I am not as harsh as\nsome say, though a woman could have far worse than a reputation for\nsternness. It can serve one well.”\nShallan had to forcibly keep herself from fidgeting. Should she\nwithdraw?\nJasnah shook her head to herself, though Shallan could not guess what\nthoughts had caused the unconscious gesture. Finally, she turned back to\nShallan and waved toward the large, gobletlike bowl on the desk. It held a\ndozen of Shallan’s spheres.\nShallan raised her freehand to her lips in shock. She’d completely\nforgotten the money. She bowed to Jasnah in thanks, then hurriedly\ncollected the spheres. “Brightness, lest I forget, I should mention that an\nardent—Brother Kabsal—came to see you while I waited here. He wished\nme to pass on his desire to speak with you.”\n“Not surprising,” Jasnah said. “You seem surprised about the spheres,\nMiss Davar. I assumed that you were waiting outside to recover them. Is\nthat not why you were so close?”\n“No, Brightness. I was just settling my nerves.”\n“Ah.”\nShallan bit her lip. The princess appeared to have gotten past her initial\ntirade. Perhaps…“Brightness,” Shallan said, cringing at her brashness,\n“what did you think of my letter?”\n“Letter?”\n“I…” Shallan glanced at the desk. “Beneath that stack of books,\nBrightness.”\nA servant quickly moved aside the stack of books; the parshman must\nhave set it on the paper without noticing. Jasnah picked up the letter, raising\nan eyebrow, and Shallan hurriedly undid her satchel and placed the spheres\nin her money pouch. Then she cursed herself for being so quick, as now she\nhad nothing to do but stand and wait for Jasnah to finish reading.\n“This is true?” Jasnah looking up from the paper. “You are self-\ntrained?”\n“Yes, Brightness.”\n“That is remarkable.”\n“Thank you, Brightness.”\n“And this letter was a clever maneuver. You correctly assumed that I\nwould respond to a written plea. This shows me your skill with words, and\nthe rhetoric of the letter gives proof that you can think logically and make a\ngood argument.”\n“Thank you, Brightness,” Shallan said, feeling another surge of hope,\nmixed with fatigue. Her emotions had been jerked back and forth like a\nrope being used for a tugging contest.\n“You should have left the note for me, and withdrawn before I\nreturned.”\n“But then the note would have been lost beneath that stack of books.”\nJasnah raised an eyebrow at her, as if to show that she did not\nappreciate being corrected. “Very well.

Your circumstances do not excuse your lack of education in\nhistory and philosophy, but leniency is in order. I will allow you to petition\nme again at a later date, a privilege I have never given any aspiring ward.\nOnce you have a sufficient groundwork in those two subjects, come to me\nagain. If you have improved suitably, I will accept you.”\nShallan’s emotions sank. Jasnah’s offer was kindly, but it would take\nyears of study to accomplish what she asked. House Davar would have\nfallen by then, her family’s lands divided among its creditors, her brothers\nand herself stripped of title and perhaps enslaved.\n“Thank you, Brightness,” Shallan said, bowing her head.\nJasnah nodded, as if considering the matter closed. Shallan withdrew,\nwalking quietly down the hallway and pulling the cord to ring for the\nporters.\nJasnah had all but promised to accept her at a later date. For most, that\nwould be a great victory. Being trained by Jasnah Kholin—thought by some\nto be the finest living scholar—would have ensured a bright future. Shallan\nwould have married extremely well, likely to the son of a highprince, and\nwould have found new social circles open to her. Indeed, if Shallan had\npossessed the time to train under Jasnah, the sheer prestige of a Kholin\naffiliation might have been enough to save her house.\nIf only.\nEventually, Shallan made her way out of the Conclave; there were no\ngates on the front, just pillars set before the open maw. She was surprised to\ndiscover how dim it was outside. She trailed down the large steps, then took\na smaller, more cultivated side path where she would be out of the way.\nSmall shelves of ornamental shalebark had been grown along this walkway,\nand several species had let out fanlike tendrils to wave in the evening\nbreeze. A few lazy lifespren—like specks of glowing green dust—flitted\nfrom one frond to the next.\nShallan leaned back against the stonelike plant, the tendrils pulling in\nand hiding. From this vantage, she could look down at Kharbranth, lights\nglowing beneath her like a cascade of fire streaming down the cliff face.\nThe only other option for her and her brothers was to run. To abandon the\nfamily estates in Jah Keved and seek asylum. But where? Were there old\nallies her father hadn’t alienated?\nThere was that matter of the strange collection of maps they’d found in\nhis study. What did they mean? He’d rarely spoken of his plans to his\nchildren. Even her father’s advisors knew very little. Helaran—her eldest\nbrother—had known more, but he had vanished over a year ago, and her\nfather had proclaimed him dead.\nAs always, thinking of her father made her feel ill, and the pain started\nto constrict her chest. She raised her freehand to her head, suddenly\noverwhelmed by the weight of House Davar’s situation, her part in it, and\nthe secret she now carried, hidden ten heartbeats away."

She turned, shocked to see Yalb\nstanding up on a rocky shelf a short distance from the Conclave entrance. A\ngroup of men in guard uniforms sat on the rock around him.\n“Yalb?” she said, aghast. He should have returned to his ship hours\nago. She hurried over to stand below the short stone outcropping. “Why are\nyou still here?”\n“Oh,” he said, grinning, “I found myself a game of kabers here with\nthese fine, upstanding gentlemen of the city guard. Figured officers of the\nlaw were right unlikely to cheat me, so we entered into a friendly-type\ngame while I waited.”\n“But you didn’t need to wait.”\n“Didn’t need to win eighty chips off these fellows neither,” Yalb said\nwith a laugh. “But I did both!”\nThe men sitting around him looked far less enthusiastic. Their\nuniforms were orange tabards tied about the middle with white sashes.\n“Well, I suppose I should be leading you back to the ship, then,” Yalb\nsaid, reluctantly gathering up the spheres in the pile at his feet. They glowed\nwith a variety of hues. Their light was small—each was only a chip—but it\nwas impressive winnings.\nShallan stepped back as Yalb hopped off the rock shelf. His\ncompanions protested his departure, but he gestured to Shallan. “You’d\nhave me leave a lighteyed woman of her stature to walk back to the ship on\nher own? I figured you for men of honor!”\nThat quieted their protests.\nYalb chuckled to himself, bowing to Shallan and leading her away\ndown the path. He had a twinkle to his eyes. “Stormfather, but it’s fun to\nwin against lawmen. I’ll have free drinks at the docks once this gets\naround.”\n“You shouldn’t gamble,” Shallan said. “You shouldn’t try to guess the\nfuture. I didn’t give you that sphere so you could waste it on such\npractices.”\nYalb laughed. “It ain’t gambling if you know you’re going to win,\nyoung miss.”\n“You cheated?” she hissed, horrified. She glanced back at the\nguardsmen, who had settled down to continue their game, lit by the spheres\non the stones before them.\n“Not so loud!” Yalb said in a low voice. However, he seemed very\npleased with himself. “Cheating four guardsmen, now that’s a trick. Hardly\nbelieve I managed it!”\n“I’m disappointed in you. This is not proper behavior.”\n“It is if you’re a sailor, young miss.” He shrugged. “It’s what they right\nexpected from me. Watched me like handlers of poisonous skyeels, they\ndid. The game wasn’t about the cards—it was about them trying to figure\nhow I was cheating and me trying to figure how to keep them from hauling\nme off. I think I might not have managed to walk away with my skin if you\nhadn’t arrived!” That didn’t seem to worry him much.\nThe roadway down to the docks was not nearly as busy as it had been"

I think I might not have managed to walk away with my skin if you\nhadn’t arrived!” That didn’t seem to worry him much.\nThe roadway down to the docks was not nearly as busy as it had been\nearlier, but there were still a surprisingly large number of people about. The\nstreet was lit by oil lanterns—spheres would just have ended up in\nsomeone’s pouch—but many of the people about carried sphere lanterns,\ncasting a rainbow of colored light on the roadway. The people were almost\nlike spren, each a different hue, moving this way or that.\n“So, young miss,” Yalb said, leading her carefully through the traffic.\n“You really want to go back? I just said what I did so I could extract myself\nfrom that game there.”\n“Yes, I do want to go back, please.”\n“And your princess?”\nShallan grimaced. “The meeting was…unproductive.”\n“She didn’t take you? What’s wrong with her?”\n“Chronic competence, I should guess. She’s been so successful in life\nthat she has unrealistic expectations of others.”\nYalb frowned, guiding Shallan around a group of revelers stumbling\ndrunkenly up the roadway. Wasn’t it a little early for that sort of thing? Yalb\ngot a few steps ahead, turning and walking backward, looking at her. “That\ndoesn’t make sense, young miss. What more could she want than you?”\n“Much more, apparently.”\n“But you’re perfect! Pardon my forwardness.”\n“You’re walking backward.”\n“Pardon my backwardness, then. You look good from any side, young\nmiss, that you do.”\nShe found herself smiling. Tozbek’s sailors had far too high an opinion\nof her.\n“You’d make an ideal ward,” he continued. “Genteel, pretty, refined\nand such. Don’t much like your opinion on gambling, but that’s to be\nexpected. Wouldn’t be right for a proper woman not to scold a fellow for\ngambling. It’d be like the sun refusing to rise or the sea turning white.”\n“Or Jasnah Kholin smiling.”\n“Exactly! Anyway, you’re perfect.”\n“It’s kind of you to say so.”\n“Well, it’s true,” he said, putting hands on hips, stopping. “So that’s it?\nYou’re going to give up?”\nShe gave him a perplexed stare. He stood there on the busy roadway,\nlit from above by a lantern burning yellow-orange, hands on his hips, white\nThaylen eyebrows drooping along the sides of his face, bare-chested under\nhis open vest. That was a posture no citizen, no matter how high ranked,\nhad ever taken at her father’s mansion.\n“I did try to persuade her,” Shallan said, blushing. “I went to her a\nsecond time, and she rejected me again.”\n“Two times, eh? In cards, you always got to try a third hand. It wins\nthe most often.”\nShallan frowned. “But that’s not really true. The laws of probability\nand statistics—”\n“Don’t know much blustering math,” Yalb said, folding his arms. “But\nI do know the Passions. You win when you need it most, you see.”\nThe Passions.

Of course, Jasnah had referred to\nglyphwards as superstition too, so perhaps it all came down to perspective.\nTry a third time…Shallan shivered to consider Jasnah’s wrath if\nShallan bothered her yet again. She’d surely withdraw the offer to come\nstudy with her in the future.\nBut Shallan would never get to take that offer. It was like a glass\nsphere with no gemstone at the center. Pretty, but worthless. Was it not\nbetter to take one last chance at getting the position she needed now?\nIt wouldn’t work. Jasnah had made it quite clear that Shallan was not\nyet educated enough.\nNot yet educated enough…\nAn idea sparked in Shallan’s head. She raised her safehand to her\nbreast, standing on that roadway, considering the audacity of it. She’d likely\nget herself thrown from the city at Jasnah’s demand.\nYet if she returned home without trying every avenue, could she face\nher brothers? They depended on her. For once in her life, someone needed\nShallan. That responsibility excited her. And terrified her.\n“I need a book merchant,” she found herself saying, voice wavering\nslightly.\nYalb raised an eyebrow at her.\n“Third hand wins the most. Do you think you can find me a book\nmerchant who is open at this hour?”\n“Kharbranth is a major port, young miss,” he said with a laugh. “Stores\nstay open late. Just wait here.” He dashed off into the evening crowd,\nleaving her with an anxious protest on her lips.\nShe sighed, then seated herself in a demure posture on the stone base\nof a lantern pole. It should be safe. She saw other lighteyed women passing\non the street, though they were often carried in palanquins or those small,\nhand-pulled vehicles. She even saw the occasional real carriage, though\nonly the very wealthy could afford to keep horses.\nA few minutes later, Yalb popped out of the crowd as if from nowhere\nand waved for her to follow. She rose and hurried to him.\n“Should we get a porter?” she asked as he led her to a large side street\nthat ran laterally across the city’s hill. She stepped carefully; her skirt was\nlong enough that she worried about tearing the hem on the stone. The strip\nat the bottom was designed to be easily replaced, but Shallan could hardly\nafford to waste spheres on such things.\n“Nah,” Yalb said. “It’s right here.” He pointed along another cross\nstreet. This one had a row of shops climbing up the steep slope, each with a\nsign hanging out front bearing the glyphpair for book, and those glyphs\nwere often styled into the shape of a book. Illiterate servants who might be\nsent to a shop had to be able to recognize them.\n“Merchants of the same type like to clump together,” Yalb said,\nrubbing his chin. “Seems dumb to me, but I guess merchants are like fish.\nWhere you find one, you’ll find others.”\n“The same could be said of ideas,” Shallan said, counting. Six different\nshops. All were lit with Stormlight in the windows, cool and even."

All were lit with Stormlight in the windows, cool and even.\n“Third one on the left,” Yalb said, pointing. “Merchant’s name is\nArtmyrn. My sources say he’s the best.” It was a Thaylen name. Likely Yalb\nhad asked others from his homeland, and they had pointed him here.\nShe nodded to Yalb and they climbed up the steep stone street to the\nshop. Yalb didn’t enter with her; she’d noticed that many men were\nuncomfortable around books and reading, even those who weren’t Vorin.\nShe pushed through the door—stout wood set with two crystal panels\n—and stepped into a warm room, uncertain what to expect. She’d never\ngone into a store to purchase anything; she’d either sent servants, or the\nmerchants had come to her.\nThe room inside looked very inviting, with large, comfortable easy\nchairs beside a hearth. Flamespren danced on burning logs there, and the\nfloor was wood. Seamless wood; it had probably been Soulcast that way\ndirectly from the stone beneath. Lavish indeed.\nA woman stood behind a counter at the back of the room. She wore an\nembroidered skirt and blouse, rather than the sleek, silk, one-piece havah\nthat Shallan wore. She was darkeyed, but she was obviously affluent. In\nVorin kingdoms, she’d likely be of the first or second nahn. Thaylens had\ntheir own system of ranks. At least they weren’t completely pagan—they\nrespected eye color, and the woman wore a glove on her safehand.\nThere weren’t many books in the place. A few on the counter, one on a\nstand beside the chairs. A clock ticked on the wall, its underside hung with a\ndozen shimmering silver bells. This looked more like a person’s home than\na shop.\nThe woman slid a marker into her book, smiling at Shallan. It was a\nsmooth, eager smile. Almost predatory. “Please, Brightness, sit,” she said,\nwaving toward the chairs. The woman had curled her long, white Thaylen\neyebrows so they hung down the sides of her face like locks from her\nbangs.\nShallan sat hesitantly as the woman rang a bell on the underside of the\ncounter. Soon, a portly man waddled into the room wearing a vest that\nseemed ready to burst from the stress of holding in his girth. His hair was\ngreying, and he kept his eyebrows combed back, over his ears.\n“Ah,” he said, clapping ample hands, “dear young woman. Are you in\nthe market for a nice novel? Some leisure reading to pass the cruel hours\nwhile you are separated from a lost love? Or perhaps a book on geography,\nwith details of exotic locations?” He had a slightly condescending tone and\nspoke in her native Veden.\n“I—No, thank you. I need an extensive set of books on history and\nthree on philosophy.” She thought back, trying to recall the names Jasnah\nhad used. “Something by Placini, Gabrathin, Yustara, Manaline, or Shauka-\ndaughter-Hasweth.”"

She ducked into the back room. He’d\nuse her for reading; even if he could read himself, he wouldn’t want to off\nend customers by doing so in their presence. He would handle the money;\ncommerce was a masculine art in most situations.\n“Now, why is a young flower like yourself bothering herself with such\ntopics?” the merchant said, easing himself down into the chair across from\nher. “Can’t I interest you in a nice romantic novel? They are my specialty,\nyou see. Young women from across the city come to me, and I always carry\nthe best.”\nHis tone set her on edge. It was galling enough to know she was a\nsheltered child. Was it really necessary to remind her of it? “A romantic\nnovel,” she said, holding her satchel close to her chest. “Yes, perhaps that\nwould be nice. Do you by chance have a copy of Nearer the Flame?”\nThe merchant blinked. Nearer the Flame was written from the\nviewpoint of a man who slowly descended into madness after watching his\nchildren starve.\n“Are you certain you want something so, er, ambitious?” the man\nasked.\n“Is ambition such an unseemly attribute in a young woman?”\n“Well, no, I suppose not.” He smiled again—the thick, toothy smile of\na merchant trying to put someone at ease. “I can see you are a woman of\ndiscriminating taste.”\n“I am,” Shallan said, voice firm though her heart fluttered. Was she\ndestined to get into an argument with everyone she met? “I do like my\nmeals prepared very carefully, as my palate is quite delicate.”\n“Pardon. I meant that you have discriminating taste in books.”\n“I’ve never eaten one, actually.”\n“Brightness, I believe you are having sport with me.”\n“Not yet I’m not. I haven’t even really begun.”\n“I—”\n“Now,” she said, “you were right to compare the mind and the\nstomach.”\n“But—”\n“Too many of us,” she said, “take great pains with what we ingest\nthrough our mouths, and far less with what we partake of through our ears\nand eyes. Wouldn’t you say?”\nHe nodded, perhaps not trusting her to let him speak without\ninterrupting. Shallan knew, somewhere in the back of her mind, that she\nwas letting herself go too far—that she was tense and frustrated after her\ninteractions with Jasnah.\nShe didn’t care at the moment. “Discriminating,” she said, testing the\nworld. “I’m not certain I agree with your choice of words. To discriminate\nis to maintain prejudice against. To be exclusive. Can a person afford to be\nexclusive with what they ingest? Whether we speak of food or of\nthoughts?”\n“I think they must be,” the merchant said. “Isn’t that what you just\nsaid?”\n“I said we should take thought for what we read or eat. Not that we\nshould be exclusive. Tell me, what do you think would happen to a person\nwho ate only sweets?”"

The body needs many different foods\nto remain healthy. And the mind needs many different ideas to remain\nsharp. Wouldn’t you agree? And so if I were to read only these silly\nromances you presume that my ambition can handle, my mind would grow\nsick as surely as your sister-in-law’s stomach. Yes, I should think that the\nmetaphor is a solid one. You are quite clever, Master Artmyrn.”\nHis smile returned.\n“Of course,” she noted, not smiling back, “being talked down to upsets\nboth the mind and the stomach. So nice of you to give a poignant object\nlesson to accompany your brilliant metaphor. Do you treat all of your\ncustomers this way?”\n“Brightness…I believe you stray into sarcasm.”\n“Funny. I thought I’d run straight into it, screaming at the top of my\nlungs.”\nHe blushed and stood. “I’ll go help my wife.” He hurriedly withdrew.\nShe sat back, and realized she was annoyed at herself for letting her\nfrustration boil out. It was just what her nurses had warned her about. A\nyoung woman had to mind her words. Her father’s intemperate tongue had\nearned their house a regrettable reputation; would she add to it?\nShe calmed herself, enjoying the warmth and watching the dancing\nflamespren until the merchant and his wife returned, bearing several stacks\nof books. The merchant took his seat again, and his wife pulled over a stool,\nsetting the tomes on the floor and then showing them one at a time as her\nhusband spoke.\n“For history, we have two choices,” the merchant said, condescension\n—and friendliness—gone. “Times and Passage, by Rencalt, is a single\nvolume survey of Rosharan history since the Hierocracy.” His wife held up\na red, cloth-bound volume. “I told my wife that you would likely be\ninsulted by such a shallow option, but she insisted.”\n“Thank you,” Shallan said. “I am not insulted, but I do require\nsomething more detailed.”\n“Then perhaps Eternathis will serve you,” he said as his wife held up a\nblue-grey set of four volumes. “It is a philosophical work which examines\nthe same time period by focusing only on the interactions of the five Vorin\nkingdoms. As you can see, the treatment is exhaustive.”\nThe four volumes were thick. The five Vorin kingdoms? She’d thought\nthere were four. Jah Keved, Alethkar, Kharbranth, and Natanatan. United by\nreligion, they had been strong allies during the years following the\nRecreance. What was the fifth kingdom?\nThe volumes intrigued her. “I will take them.”\n“Excellent,” the merchant said, a bit of the gleam returning to his eye.\n“Of the philosophical works you listed, we didn’t have anything by Yustara.\nWe have one each of works by Placini and Manaline; both are collections of"

I’ve had the Placini book read to\nme; it’s quite good.”\nShallan nodded.\n“As for Gabrathin,” he said, “we have four different volumes. My, but\nhe was a prolific one! Oh, and we have a single book by Shauka-daughter-\nHasweth.” The wife held up a thin green volume. “I have to admit, I’ve\nnever had any of her work read to me. I didn’t realize that there were any\nShin philosophers of note.”\nShallan looked at the four books by Gabrathin. She had no idea which\none she should take, so she avoided the question, pointing at the two\ncollections he had mentioned first and the single volume by Shauka-\ndaughter-Hasweth. A philosopher from distant Shin, where people lived in\nmud and worshipped rocks? The man who had killed Jasnah’s father nearly\nsix years before—prompting the war against the Parshendi in Natanatan—\nhad been Shin. The Assassin in White, they called him.\n“I will take those three,” Shallan said, “along with the histories.”\n“Excellent!” the merchant repeated. “For buying so many, I will give\nyou a fair discount. Let us say, ten emerald broams?”\nShallan nearly choked. An emerald broam was the largest\ndenomination of sphere, worth a thousand diamond chips. Ten of them was\nmore than her trip to Kharbranth had cost by several magnitudes!\nShe opened her satchel, looking in at her money pouch. She had\naround eight emerald broams left. She’d have to take fewer of the books,\nobviously, but which ones?\nSuddenly, the door slammed open. Shallan jumped and was surprised\nto see Yalb standing there, holding his cap in his hands, nervous. He rushed\nto her chair, going down on one knee. She was too stunned to say anything.\nWhy was he so worried?\n“Brightness,” he said, bowing his head. “My master bids you return.\nHe’s reconsidered his offer. Truly, we can take the price you offered.”\nShallan opened her mouth, but found herself stupefied.\nYalb glanced at the merchant. “Brightness, don’t buy from this man.\nHe’s a liar and a cheat. My master will sell you much finer books at a better\nprice.”\n“Now, what’s this?” Artmyrn said, standing. “How dare you! Who is\nyour master?”\n“Barmest,” Yalb said defensively.\n“That rat. He sends a boy into my shop trying to steal my customer?\nOutrageous!”\n“She came to our shop first!” Yalb said.\nShallan finally recovered her wits. Stormfather! He’s quite the actor.\n“You had your chance,” she said to Yalb. “Run along and tell your master\nthat I refuse to be swindled. I will visit every bookshop in the city if that is\nwhat it takes to find someone reasonable.”\n“Artmyrn isn’t reasonable,” Yalb said, spitting to the side. The"

The\nmerchant’s eyes opened wide with rage.\n“We shall see,” Shallan said.\n“Brightness,” Artmyrn said, red faced. “Surely you don’t believe these\nallegations!”\n“And how much were you going to charge her?” Yalb asked.\n“Ten emerald broams,” Shallan said. “For those seven books.”\nYalb laughed. “And you didn’t stand up and walk right out! You\npractically had my master’s ears, and he offered you a better deal than that!\nPlease, Brightness, return with me. We’re ready to—”\n“Ten was just an opening figure,” Artmyrn said. “I didn’t expect her to\ntake them.” He looked at Shallan. “Of course, eight….”\nYalb laughed again. “I’m sure we have those same books, Brightness.\nI’ll bet my master gives them to you for two.”\nArtmyrn grew even more red-faced, muttering. “Brightness, surely you\nwouldn’t patronize someone so crass as to send a servant into someone\nelse’s shop to steal his customers!”\n“Perhaps I would,” Shallan said. “At least he didn’t insult my\nintelligence.”\nArtmyrn’s wife glared at her husband, and the man grew even more\nred in the face. “Two emerald, three sapphire. That is as low as I can go. If\nyou want cheaper than that, then buy from that scoundrel Barmest. The\nbooks will probably be missing pages, though.”\nShallan hesitated, glancing at Yalb; he was caught up in his role,\nbowing and scraping. She caught his eyes, and he just kind of gave a shrug.\n“I’ll do it,” she said to Artmyrn, prompting a groan from Yalb. He\nslunk away with a curse from Artmyrn’s wife. Shallan rose and counted out\nthe spheres; the emerald broams she retrieved from her safepouch.\nSoon, she walked from the shop bearing a heavy canvas bag. She\nwalked down the steep street, and found Yalb lounging beside a lamppost.\nShe smiled as he took the bag from her. “How did you know what a fair\nprice for a book was?” she asked.\n“Fair price?” he said, slinging the bag over his shoulder. “For a book?\nI’ve no idea. I just figured he’d be trying to take you for as much as he\ncould. That’s why I asked around for who his biggest rival was and came\nback to help get him to be more reasonable.”\n“It was that obvious I’d let myself be swindled?” she asked with a\nblush, the two of them walking out of the side street.\nYalb chuckled. “Just a little. Anyway, conning men like him is almost\nas much fun as cheating guards. You probably could have gotten him down\nfurther by actually leaving with me, then coming back later to give him\nanother chance.”\n“That sounds complicated.”\n“Merchants is like mercenaries, my gammer always said. Only\ndifference is that merchants will take your head off, then pretend to be your\nfriend all the same.”"

Only\ndifference is that merchants will take your head off, then pretend to be your\nfriend all the same.”\nThis from a man who had just spent the evening cheating a group of\nguards at cards. “Well, you have my thanks, anyway.”\n“Wasn’t nothing. It was fun, though I can’t believe you paid what you\ndid. It’s just a bunch of wood. I could find some driftwood and put some\nfunny marks on it. Would you pay me pure spheres for that too?”\n“I can’t offer that,” she said, fishing in her satchel. She took out the\npicture she’d drawn of Yalb and the porter. “But please, take this, with my\nthanks.”\nYalb took the picture and stepped up beneath a nearby lantern to get a\nlook. He laughed, cocking his head, smiling broadly. “Stormfather! Ain’t\nthat something? Looks like I’m seeing myself in a polished plate, it does. I\ncan’t take this, Brightness!”\n“Please. I insist.” She did, however, blink her eyes, taking a Memory\nof him standing there, one hand on his chin as he studied the picture of\nhimself. She’d redraw him later. After what he’d done for her, she dearly\nwanted him in her collection.\nYalb carefully tucked the picture between the pages of a book, then\nhefted the bag and continued. They stepped back onto the main roadway.\nNomon—the middle moon—had begun to rise, bathing the city in pale blue\nlight. Staying up this late had been a rare privilege for her in her father’s\nhouse, but these city people around them barely seemed to notice the late\nhour. What a strange place this city was.\n“Back to the ship now?” Yalb asked.\n“No,” Shallan said, taking a deep breath. “Back to the Conclave.”\nHe raised an eyebrow, but led her back. Once there, she bid Yalb\nfarewell, reminding him to take his picture. He did so, wishing her luck\nbefore hastening from the Conclave, probably worried about meeting the\nguardsmen he’d cheated earlier.\nShallan had a servant carry her books, and made her way down the\nhallway back to the Veil. Just inside the ornate iron doors, she caught the\nattention of a master-servant.\n“Yes, Brightness?” the man asked. Most of the alcoves were now dim,\nand patient servants were returning tomes to their safe place beyond the\ncrystal walls.\nShaking off her fatigue, Shallan counted up the rows. There was still a\nlight in Jasnah’s alcove. “I’d like to use the alcove there,” she said, pointing\nto the next balcony over.\n“Do you have a chit of admittance?”\n“I’m afraid not.”\n“Then you’ll have to rent the space if you wish to use it regularly. Two\nskymarks.”\nWincing at the price, Shallan dug out the proper spheres and paid. Her\nmoney pouches were looking depressingly flat. She let the parshman porters\nhaul her up to the appropriate level, then she quietly walked to her alcove.\nThere, she used all her remaining spheres to fill the oversized goblet lamp."

Jasnah sat studying, heedless of the hour, her goblet filled to the brim\nwith pure diamond broams. They were best for light, but less useful in\nSoulcasting, so weren’t as valuable.\nShallan ducked back around. There was a place at the very edge of the\nalcove’s table where she could sit, hidden by the wall from Jasnah, so she\nsat there. Perhaps she should have chosen an alcove on another level, but\nshe wanted to keep an eye on the woman. Hopefully Jasnah would spend\nweeks here studying. Enough time for Shallan to dedicate herself to some\nfierce cramming. Her ability to memorize pictures and scenes didn’t work\nas well on text, but she could learn lists and facts at a rate that her tutors had\nfound remarkable.\nShe settled herself in the chair, pulling out the books and arranging\nthem. She rubbed her eyes. It was really quite late, but there wasn’t time to\nwaste. Jasnah had said that Shallan could make another petition when the\ngaps in her knowledge were filled. Well, Shallan intended to fill those gaps\nin record time, then present herself again. She’d do it when Jasnah was\nready to leave Kharbranth.\nIt was a last, desperate hope, so frail that a strong gust of circumstance\nseemed likely to topple it. Taking a deep breath, Shallan opened the first of\nthe history books.\n“I’m never going to be rid of you, am I?” a soft, feminine voice asked.\nShallan jumped up, nearly knocking over her books as she spun toward\nthe doorway. Jasnah Kholin stood there, deep blue dress embroidered in\nsilver, its silken sheen reflecting the light of Shallan’s spheres. The\nSoulcaster was covered by a fingerless black glove to block the bright\ngemstones.\n“Brightness,” Shallan said, rising and curtsying in an awkward rush. “I\ndidn’t mean to disturb you. I—”\nJasnah quieted her with a wave of the hand. She stepped aside as a\nparshman entered Shallan’s alcove, carrying a chair. He placed it beside\nShallan’s desk, and Jasnah glided over and sat.\nShallan tried to judge Jasnah’s mood, but the older woman’s emotions\nwere impossible to read. “I honestly didn’t want to disturb you.”\n“I bribed the servants to tell me if you returned to the Veil,” Jasnah\nsaid idly, picking up one of Shallan’s tomes, reading the title. “I didn’t want\nto be interrupted again.”\n“I—” Shallan looked down, blushing furiously.\n“Don’t bother apologizing,” Jasnah said. She looked tired; more tired\nthan Shallan felt. Jasnah picked through the books. “A fine selection. You\nchose well.”\n“It wasn’t really much of a choice,” Shallan said. “It was just about all\nthe merchant had.”"

I should have put a time restriction on your\nreapplication.” She looked at Shallan, glancing her over. “You are very\ndetermined. That is good. And I know why you wish so desperately to be\nmy ward.”\nShallan started. She knew?\n“Your house has many enemies,” Jasnah continued, “and your father is\nreclusive. It will be difficult for you to marry well without a tactically sound\nalliance.”\nShallan relaxed, though she tried to keep it from showing.\n“Let me see your satchel,” Jasnah said.\nShallan frowned, resisting the urge to pull it close. “Brightness?”\nJasnah held out her hand. “You recall what I said about repeating\nmyself?”\nReluctantly, Shallan handed it over. Jasnah carefully removed its\ncontents, neatly lining up the brushes, pencils, pens, jar of lacquer, ink, and\nsolvent. She placed the stacks of paper, the notebooks, and the finished\npictures in a line. Then she got out Shallan’s money pouches, noting their\nemptiness. She glanced at the goblet lamp, counting its contents. She raised\nan eyebrow.\nNext, she began to look through Shallan’s pictures. First the loose-leaf\nones, where she lingered on Shallan’s picture of Jasnah herself. Shallan\nwatched the woman’s face. Was she pleased? Surprised? Displeased at how\nmuch time Shallan spent sketching sailors and serving women?\nFinally, Jasnah moved on to the sketchbook filled with drawings of\nplants and animals Shallan had observed during her trip. Jasnah spent the\nlongest on this, reading through each notation. “Why have you made these\nsketches?” Jasnah asked at the end.\n“Why, Brightness? Well, because I wanted to.” She grimaced. Should\nshe have said something profound instead?\nJasnah nodded slowly. Then she rose. “I have rooms in the Conclave,\ngranted to me by the king. Gather your things and go there. You look\nexhausted.”\n“Brightness?” Shallan asked, rising, a thrill of excitement running\nthrough her.\nJasnah hesitated at the doorway. “At first meeting, I took you for a\nrural opportunist, seeking only to ride my name to greater wealth.”\n“You’ve changed your mind?”\n“No,” Jasnah said, “there is undoubtedly some of that in you. But we\nare each many different people, and you can tell much about a person by\nwhat they carry with them. If that notebook is any indication, you pursue\nscholarship in your free time for its own sake. That is encouraging.

She got out a sheet of paper\nand wrote a quick prayer of thanks, which she’d burn later. Then she\nhurriedly gathered up her books and went looking for a servant to send to\nthe Wind’s Pleasure for her trunk.\nIt had been a very, very long day. But she’d won. The first step had\nbeen completed.\nNow her real task began.\n“Ten people, with Shardblades alight, standing before a wall of black\nand white and red.”\n—Collected: Jesachev, 1173, 12 seconds pre-death. Subject: one of our\nown ardents, overheard during his last moments.\nKaladin had not been assigned to Bridge Four by chance. Out of all the\nbridge crews, Bridge Four had the highest casualty rate. That was\nparticularly notable, considering that average bridge crews often lost one-\nthird to one-half of their number on a single run.\nKaladin sat outside, back to the barrack wall, a sprinkle of rain falling\non him. It wasn’t a highstorm. Just an ordinary spring rain. Soft. A timid\ncousin to the great storms.\nSyl sat on Kaladin’s shoulder. Or hovered on it. Whatever. She didn’t\nseem to have any weight. Kaladin sat slumped, chin against his chest,\nstaring at a dip in the stone, which was slowly collecting rainwater.\nHe should have moved inside Bridge Four’s barrack. It was cold and\nunfurnished, but it would keep off the rain. But he just…couldn’t care. How\nlong had he been with Bridge Four now? Two weeks? Three? An eternity?\nOf the twenty-five men who had survived his first bridge deployment,\ntwenty-three were now dead. Two had been moved to other bridge crews\nbecause they’d done something to please Gaz, but they’d died there. Only\none other man and Kaladin remained. Two out of nearly forty.\nThe bridge crew’s numbers had been replenished with more\nunfortunates, and most of those had died too. They had been replaced.\nMany of those had died. Bridgeleader after bridgeleader had been chosen. It\nwas supposed to be a favored position on a bridge crew, always getting to\nrun in the best places. It didn’t matter for Bridge Four.\nSome bridge runs weren’t as bad. If the Alethi arrived before the\nParshendi, no bridgemen died. And if they arrived too late, sometimes\nanother highprince was already there. Sadeas wouldn’t help in that case;\nhe’d take his army and go back to camp. Even in a bad run, the Parshendi\nwould often choose to focus their arrows on certain crews, trying to bring\nthem down one at a time. Sometimes, dozens of bridgemen would fall, but\nnot a single one from Bridge Four.\nThat was rare. For some reason, Bridge Four always seemed to get\ntargeted.

None\nof the bridgemen did. What was the point? Learn a man’s name, and one of\nyou would be dead before the week was out. Odds were, you’d both be\ndead. Maybe he should learn names. Then he’d have someone to talk to in\nDamnation. They could reminisce about how terrible Bridge Four had been,\nand agree that eternal fires were much more pleasant.\nHe smirked dully, still staring at the rock in front of him. Gaz would\ncome for them soon, send them to work. Scrubbing latrines, cleaning\nstreets, mucking stables, gathering rocks. Something to keep their minds off\ntheir fate.\nHe still didn’t know why they fought on those blustering plateaus.\nSomething about those large chrysalises. They had gemstones at their\nhearts, apparently. But what did that have to do with the Vengeance Pact?\nAnother bridgeman—a youthful Veden with reddish-blond hair—lay\nnearby, staring up into the spitting sky. Rainwater pooled in the corners of\nhis brown eyes, then ran down his face. He didn’t blink.\nThey couldn’t run. The warcamp might as well have been a prison.\nThe bridgemen could go to the merchants and spend their meager earnings\non cheap wine or whores, but they couldn’t leave the warcamp. The\nperimeter was secure. Partially, this was to keep out soldiers from the other\ncamps—there was always rivalry where armies met. But mostly it was so\nbridgemen and slaves could not flee.\nWhy? Why did this all have to be so horrible? None of it made sense.\nWhy not let a few bridgemen run out in front of the bridges with shields to\nblock arrows? He’d asked, and had been told that would slow them down\ntoo much. He’d asked again, and had been told he’d be strung up if he\ndidn’t shut his mouth.\nThe lighteyes acted as if this entire mess were some kind of grand\ngame. If it was, the rules were hidden from bridgemen, just as pieces on a\nboard had no inkling what the player’s strategy might be.\n“Kaladin?” Syl asked, floating down and landing on his leg, holding\nthe girlish form with the long dress flowing into mist. “Kaladin? You\nhaven’t spoken in days.”\nHe kept staring, slumped. There was a way out. Bridgemen could visit\nthe chasm nearest the camp. There were rules forbidding it, but the sentries\nignored them. It was seen as the one mercy that could be given the\nbridgemen.\nBridgemen who took that path never returned.\n“Kaladin?” Syl said, voice soft, worried.\n“My father used to say that there are two kinds of people in the world,”\nKaladin whispered, voice raspy. “He said there are those who take lives.\nAnd there are those who save lives.”\nSyl frowned, cocking her head. This kind of conversation confused\nher; she wasn’t good with abstractions.\n“I used to think he was wrong. I thought there was a third group."

There\nis a third group, a big one, but it isn’t what I thought.”\n“What group?” she said, sitting down on his knee, brow scrunched up.\n“The people who exist to be saved or to be killed. The group in the\nmiddle. The ones who can’t do anything but die or be protected. The\nvictims. That’s all I am.”\nHe looked up across the wet lumberyard. The carpenters had retreated,\nthrowing tarps over untreated wood and bearing away tools that could rust.\nThe bridgeman barracks ran around the west and north sides of the yard.\nBridge Four’s was set off a little from the others, as if bad luck were a\ndisease that could be caught. Contagious by proximity, as Kaladin’s father\nwould say.\n“We exist to be killed,” Kaladin said. He blinked, glancing at the other\nfew members of Bridge Four sitting apathetically in the rain. “If we’re not\ndead already.”\n“I hate seeing you like this,” Syl said, buzzing about Kaladin’s head as his\nteam of bridgemen dragged a log down into the lumberyard. The Parshendi\noften set fire to the outermost permanent bridges, so Highprince Sadeas’s\nengineers and carpenters were always busy.\nThe old Kaladin might have wondered why the armies didn’t work\nharder to defend the bridges. There’s something wrong here! a voice inside\nhim said. You’re missing part of the puzzle. They waste resources and\nbridgeman lives. They don’t seem to care about pushing inward and\nassaulting the Parshendi. They just fight pitched battles on plateaus, then\ncome back to the camps and celebrate. Why? WHY?\nHe ignored that voice. It belonged to the man he had been.\n“You used to be vibrant,” Syl said. “So many looked up to you,\nKaladin. Your squad of soldiers. The enemies you fought. The other slaves.\nEven some lighteyes.”\nLunch would come soon. Then he could sleep until their bridgeleader\nkicked him awake for afternoon duty.\n“I used to watch you fight,” Syl said. “I can barely remember it. My\nmemories of then are fuzzy. Like looking at you through a rainstorm.”\nWait. That was odd. Syl hadn’t started following him until after his fall\nfrom the army. And she’d acted just like a regular windspren back then. He\nhesitated, earning a curse and a lash on his back from a taskmaster’s whip.\nHe started pulling again. Bridgemen who were laggard in work were\nwhipped, and bridgemen who were laggard on runs were executed. The\narmy was very serious about that. Refuse to charge the Parshendi, try to lag\nbehind the other bridges, and you’d be beheaded. They reserved that fate for\nthat specific crime, in fact.\nThere were lots of ways to get punished as a bridgeman. You could\nearn extra work detail, get whipped, have your pay docked. If you did"

But the only thing\nyou could do to be executed directly was refuse to run at the Parshendi.\nThe message was clear. Charging with your bridge might get you\nkilled, but refusing to do so would get you killed.\nKaladin and his crew lifted their log into a pile with others, then\nunhooked their dragging lines. They walked back toward the edge of the\nlumberyard, where more logs waited.\n“Gaz!” a voice called. A tall, yellow-and-black-haired soldier stood at\nthe edge of the bridge grounds, a group of miserable men huddled behind\nhim. That was Laresh, one of the soldiers who worked the duty tent. He\nbrought new bridgemen to replace those who’d been killed.\nThe day was bright, without a hint of clouds, and the sun was hot on\nKaladin’s back. Gaz hustled up to meet the new recruits, and Kaladin and\nthe others happened to be walking in that direction to pick up a log.\n“What a sorry lot,” Gaz said, looking over the recruits. “Of course, if\nthey weren’t, they wouldn’t be sent here.”\n“That’s the truth,” Laresh said. “These ten at the front were caught\nsmuggling. You know what to do.”\nNew bridgemen were constantly needed, but there were always enough\nbodies. Slaves were common, but so were thieves or other lawbreakers from\namong the camp followers. Never parshmen. They were too valuable, and\nbesides, the Parshendi were some kind of cousins to the parshmen. Better\nnot to give the parshman workers in camp the sight of their kind fighting.\nSometimes a soldier would be thrown into a bridge crew. That only\nhappened if he’d done something extremely bad, like striking an officer.\nActs that would earn a hanging in many armies meant being sent to the\nbridge crews here. Supposedly, if you survived a hundred bridge runs,\nyou’d be released. It had happened once or twice, the stories said. It was\nprobably just a myth, intended to give the bridgemen some tiny hope for\nsurvival.\nKaladin and the others walked past the newcomers, gazes down, and\nbegan hooking their ropes to the next log.\n“Bridge Four needs some men,” Gaz said, rubbing his chin.\n“Four always needs men,” Laresh said. “Don’t worry. I brought a\nspecial batch for it.” He nodded toward a second group of recruits, much\nmore ragtag, walking up behind.\nKaladin slowly stood upright. One of the prisoners in that group was a\nboy of barely fourteen or fifteen. Short, spindly, with a round face. “Tien?”\nhe whispered, taking a step forward.\nHe stopped, shaking himself. Tien was dead. But this newcomer\nlooked so familiar, with those frightened black eyes. It made Kaladin want\nto shelter the boy. Protect him.\nBut…he’d failed. Everyone he’d tried to protect—from Tien to Cenn\n—had ended up dead. What was the point?"

What was the point?\nHe turned back to dragging the log.\n“Kaladin,” Syl said, landing on the log, “I’m going to leave.”\nHe blinked in shock. Syl. Leave? But…she was the last thing he had\nleft. “No,” he whispered. It came out as a croak.\n“I’ll try to come back,” she said. “But I don’t know what will happen\nwhen I leave you. Things are strange. I have odd memories. No, most of\nthem aren’t even memories. Instincts. One of those tells me that if I leave\nyou, I might lose myself.”\n“Then don’t go,” he said, growing terrified.\n“I have to,” she said, cringing. “I can’t watch this anymore. I’ll try to\nreturn.” She looked sorrowful. “Goodbye.” And with that, she zipped away\ninto the air, adopting the form of a tiny group of tumbling, translucent\nleaves.\nKaladin watched her go, numb.\nThen he turned back to hauling the log. What else could he do?\nThe youth, the one that reminded him of Tien, died during the very next\nbridge run.\nIt was a bad one. The Parshendi were in position, waiting for Sadeas.\nKaladin charged the chasm, not even flinching as men were slaughtered\naround him. It wasn’t bravery that drove him; it wasn’t even a wish that\nthose arrows would take him and end it all. He ran. That was what he did.\nLike a boulder rolled down a hill, or like rain fell from the sky. They didn’t\nhave a choice. Neither did he. He wasn’t a man; he was a thing, and things\njust did what they did.\nThe bridgemen laid their bridges in a tight line. Four crews had fallen.\nKaladin’s own team had lost nearly enough stop them.\nBridge placed, Kaladin turned away, the army charging across the\nwood to start the real battle. He stumbled back across the plateau. After a\nfew moments, he found what he was looking for. The boy’s body.\nKaladin stood, wind whipping at his hair, looking down at the corpse.\nIt lay faceup in a small hollow in the stone. Kaladin remembered lying in a\nsimilar hollow, holding a similar corpse.\nAnother bridgeman had fallen nearby, bristling with arrows. It was the\nman who’d lived through Kaladin’s first bridge run all those weeks back.\nHis body slumped to the side, lying on a stone outcropping a foot or so\nabove the corpse of the boy. Blood dripped from the tip of an arrow sticking\nout his back. It fell, one ruby drop at a time, splattering on the boy’s open,\nlifeless eye. A little trail of red ran from the eye down the side of his face.\nLike crimson tears.\nThat night, Kaladin huddled in the barrack, listening to a highstorm\nbuff et the wall. He curled against the cold stone. Thunder shattered the sky\noutside.\nI can’t keep going like this, he thought. I’m dead inside, as sure as if\nI’d taken a spear through the neck."

        "text": "outside.\nI can’t keep going like this, he thought. I’m dead inside, as sure as if\nI’d taken a spear through the neck.\nThe storm continued its tirade. And for the first time in a year, Kaladin\nfound himself crying.\nNINE YEARS AGO\nKal stumbled into the surgery room, the open door letting in bright white\nsunlight. At ten years old, he was already showing signs that he would be\ntall and lanky. He’d always preferred Kal to his full name, Kaladin. The\nshorter name made him fit in better. Kaladin sounded like a lighteyes’s\nname.\n“I’m sorry, Father,” he said.\nKal’s father, Lirin, carefully tightened the strap around the arm of the\nyoung woman who was tied onto the narrow operating table. Her eyes were\nclosed; Kal had missed the administration of the drug. “We will discuss\nyour tardiness later,” Lirin said, securing the woman’s other hand. “Close\nthe door.”\nKal cringed and closed the door. The windows were dark, shutters\nfirmly in place, and so the only light was that of the Stormlight shining from\na large globe filled with spheres. Each of those spheres was a broam, in total\nan incredible sum that was on permanent loan from Hearthstone’s landlord.\nLanterns flickered, but Stormlight was always true. That could save lives,\nKal’s father said.\nKal approached the table, anxious. The young woman, Sani, had sleek\nblack hair, not tinged with even a single strand of brown or blond. She was\nfifteen, and her freehand was wrapped with a bloody, ragged bandage. Kal\ngrimaced at the clumsy bandaging job—it looked like the cloth had been\nripped from someone’s shirt and tied in haste.\nSani’s head rolled to the side, and she mumbled, drugged. She wore\nonly a white cotton shift, her safehand exposed. Older boys in the town\nsniggered about the chances they’d had—or claimed to have had—at seeing\ngirls in their shifts, but Kal didn’t understand what the excitement was all\nabout. He was worried about Sani, though. He always worried when\nsomeone was wounded.\nFortunately, the wound didn’t look terrible. If it had been life-\nthreatening, his father would have already begun working on it, using Kal’s\nmother—Hesina—as an assistant.\nLirin walked to the side of the room and gathered up a few small, clear\nbottles. He was a short man, balding despite his relative youth. He wore his\nspectacles, which he called the most precious gift he’d ever been given. He\nrarely got them out except for surgery, as they were too valuable to risk just\nwearing about. What if they were scratched or broken? Hearthstone was a\nlarge town, but its remote location in northern Alethkar would make\nreplacing the spectacles difficult.\nThe room was kept neat, the shelves and table washed clean each\nmorning, everything in its place. Lirin said you could tell a lot about a man\nfrom how he kept his workspace. Was it sloppy or orderly? Did he respect\nhis tools or did he leave them casually about?

The small device bore a single dial at the center and\na glowing Smokestone at its heart; it had to be infused to keep the time.\nNobody else in the town cared about minutes and hours as Lirin did.\nKal pulled over a stool to get a better vantage. Soon he wouldn’t need\nthe stool; he was growing taller by the day. He inspected Sani’s hand. She’ll\nbe all right, he told himself, as his father had trained him. A surgeon needs\nto be calm. Worry just wastes time.\nIt was hard advice to follow.\n“Hands,” Lirin said, not turning away from gathering his tools.\nKal sighed, hopping off his stool and hurrying over to the basin of\nwarm, soapy water by the door. “Why does it matter?” He wanted to be at\nwork, helping Sani.\n“Wisdom of the Heralds,” Lirin said absently, repeating a lecture he’d\ngiven many times before. “Deathspren and rotspren hate water. It will keep\nthem away.”\n“Hammie says that’s silly,” Kal said. “He says deathspren are mighty\ngood at killing folk, so why should they be afraid of a little water?”\n“The Heralds were wise beyond our understanding.”\nKal grimaced. “But they’re demons, father. I heard it off that ardent\nwho came teaching last spring.”\n“That’s the Radiants he spoke of,” Lirin said sharply. “You’re mixing\nthem again.”\nKal sighed.\n“The Heralds were sent to teach mankind,” Lirin said. “They led us\nagainst the Voidbringers after we were cast from heaven. The Radiants were\nthe orders of knights they founded.”\n“Who were demons.”\n“Who betrayed us,” Lirin said, “once the Heralds left.” Lirin raised a\nfinger. “They were not demons, they were just men who had too much\npower and not enough sense. Either way, you are always to wash your\nhands. You can see the effect it has on rotspren with your own eyes, even if\ndeathspren cannot be seen.”\nKal sighed again, but did as he was told. Lirin walked over to the table\nagain, bearing a tray lined with knives and little glass bottles. His ways\nwere odd—though Lirin made certain that his son didn’t mix up the Heralds\nand the Lost Radiants, Kal had heard his father say that he thought the\nVoidbringers weren’t real. Ridiculous. Who else could be blamed when\nthings went missing in the night, or when a crop got infected with digger-\nworms?\nThe others in town thought Lirin spent too much time with books and\nsick people, and that made him strange. They were uncomfortable around\nhim, and with Kal by association. Kal was only just beginning to realize\nhow painful it could feel to be different.\nHands washed, he hopped back up onto the stool. He began to feel\nnervous again, hoping that nothing would go wrong. His father used a\nmirror to focus the spheres’ light onto Sani’s hand.

        "text": "mirror to focus the spheres’ light onto Sani’s hand. Gingerly, he cut off the\nmakeshift bandage with a surgeon’s knife. The wound wasn’t life-\nthreatening, but the hand was pretty badly mangled. When his father had\nstarted training Kal two years before, sights like this had sickened him.\nNow he was used to torn flesh.\nThat was good. Kal figured this would be useful when he went to war\nsomeday, to fight for his highprince and the lighteyes.\nSani had three broken fingers and the skin on her hand was scraped\nand gouged, the wound cluttered with sticks and dirt. The third finger was\nthe worst, shattered and twisted nastily, splinters of bone protruding through\nthe skin. Kal felt its length, noting the fractured bones, the blackness on the\nskin. He carefully wiped away dried blood and dirt with a wet cloth, picking\nout rocks and sticks as his father cut thread for sewing.\n“The third finger will have to go, won’t it?” Kal said, tying a bandage\naround the base of the finger to keep it from bleeding.\nHis father nodded, a hint of a smile on his face. He’d hoped Kal would\ndiscern that. Lirin often said that a wise surgeon must know what to remove\nand what to save. If that third finger had been set properly at first…but no, it\nwas beyond recovery. Sewing it back together would mean leaving it to\nfester and die.\nHis father did the actual amputation. He had such careful, precise\nhands. Training as a surgeon took over ten years, and it would be some time\nyet before Lirin let Kal hold the knife. Instead, Kal wiped away blood,\nhanded his father knives, and held the sinew to keep it from tangling as his\nfather sewed. They repaired the hand so far as they could, working with\ndeliberate speed.\nKal’s father finished the final suture, obviously pleased at having been\nable to save four of the fingers. That wasn’t how Sani’s parents would see it.\nThey’d be disappointed that their beautiful daughter would now have a\ndisfigured hand. It almost always happened that way—terror at the initial\nwound, then anger at Lirin’s inability to work wonders. Lirin said it was\nbecause the townsfolk had grown accustomed to having a surgeon. To them,\nthe healing had become an expectation, rather than a privilege.\nBut Sani’s parents were good people. They’d make a small donation,\nand Kal’s family—his parents, him, and his younger brother Tien—would\ncontinue to be able to eat. Odd, how they survived because of others’\nmisfortune. Maybe that was part of what made the townsfolk resent them.\nLirin finished by using a small heated rod to cauterize where he felt the\nstitches wouldn’t be enough. Finally, he spread pungent lister’s oil across\nthe hand to prevent infection—the oil frightened away rotspren even better\nthan soap and water. Kal wrapped on clean bandages, careful not to disturb\nthe splints.\nLirin disposed of the finger, and Kal began to relax. She’d be all right.\n“You still need to work on those nerves of yours, son,” Lirin said\nsoftly, washing blood from his hands.\nKal looked down."

Kal thought back at his father.\nAnd what about being so selfless that you never charge for your work? He\ndidn’t dare say the words.\nCleaning the room came next. It seemed like half of Kal’s life was\nspent cleaning, but Lirin wouldn’t let him go until they were done with it.\nAt least he opened the shutters, letting sunlight stream in. Sani continued to\ndoze; the winterwort would keep her unconscious for hours yet.\n“So where were you?” Lirin asked, bottles of oil and alcohol clinking\nas he returned them to their places.\n“With Jam.”\n“Jam is two years your senior,” Lirin said. “I doubt he has much\nfondness for spending his time with those much younger than he.”\n“His father started training him in the quarterstaff,” Kal said in a rush.\n“Tien and I went to see what he’s learned.” Kal cringed, waiting for the\nlecture.\nHis father just continued, wiping down each of his surgeon’s knives\nwith alcohol, then oil, as the old traditions dictated. He didn’t turn toward\nKal.\n“Jam’s father was a soldier in Brightlord Amaram’s army,” Kal said\ntentatively. Brightlord Amaram! The noble lighteyed general who watched\nover northern Alethkar. Kal wanted so much to see a real lighteyes, not\nstuffy old Wistiow. A soldier, like everyone talked about, like the stories\nwere about.\n“I know about Jam’s father,” Lirin said. “I’ve had to operate on that\nlame leg of his three times now. A gift of his glorious time as a soldier.”\n“We need soldiers, father. You’d have our borders violated by the\nThaylens?”\n“Thaylenah is an island kingdom,” Lirin said calmly. “They don’t\nshare a border with us.”\n“Well, then, they could attack from sea!”\n“They’re mostly tradesmen and merchants. Every one I’ve met has\ntried to swindle me, but that’s hardly the same thing as invading.”\nAll the boys liked to tell stories about far-off places. It was hard to\nremember that Kal’s father—the only man of second nahn in the town—had\ntraveled all the way to Kharbranth during his youth.\n“Well, we fight with someone,” Kal continued, moving to scrub the\nfloor.\n“Yes,” his father said after a pause. “King Gavilar always finds people\nfor us to fight. That much is true.”\n“So we need soldiers, like I said.”\n“We need surgeons more.” Lirin sighed audibly, turning away from his\ncabinet. “Son, you nearly cry each time someone is brought to us; you grind\nyour teeth anxiously during even simple procedures. What makes you think\nyou could actually hurt someone?”\n“I’ll get stronger.”\n“That’s foolishness. Who’s put these ideas in your head? Why would\nyou want to learn to hit other boys with a stick?”"

Why would\nyou want to learn to hit other boys with a stick?”\n“For honor, Father,” Kal said. “Who tells stories about surgeons, for\nthe Heralds’s sake!”\n“The children of the men and women whose lives we save,” Lirin said\nevenly, meeting Kal’s gaze. “That’s who tell stories of surgeons.”\nKal blushed and shrank back, then finally returned to his scrubbing.\n“There are two kinds of people in this world, son,” his father said\nsternly. “Those who save lives. And those who take lives.”\n“And what of those who protect and defend? The ones who save lives\nby taking lives?”\nHis father snorted. “That’s like trying to stop a storm by blowing\nharder. Ridiculous. You can’t protect by killing.”\nKal kept scrubbing.\nFinally, his father sighed, walking over and kneeling down beside him,\nhelping with the scrubbing. “What are the properties of winterwort?”\n“Bitter taste,” Kal said immediately, “which makes it safer to keep,\nsince people won’t eat it by accident. Crush it to powder, mix it with oil,\nuse one spoonful per ten brickweight of the person you’re drugging.\nInduces a deep sleep for about five hours.”\n“And how can you tell if someone has the fiddlepox?”\n“Nervous energy,” Kal said, “thirst, trouble sleeping, and swelling on\nthe undersides of the arms.”\n“You’ve got such a good mind, son,” Lirin said softly. “It took me\nyears to learn what you’ve done in months. I’ve been saving. I’d like to\nsend you to Kharbranth when you turn sixteen, to train with real surgeons.”\nKal felt a spike of excitement. Kharbranth? That was in an entirely\ndifferent kingdom! Kal’s father had traveled there as a courier, but he hadn’t\ntrained there as a surgeon. He’d learned from old Vathe in Shorse broon, the\nnearest town of any size.\n“You have a gift from the Heralds themselves,” Lirin said, resting a\nhand on Kal’s shoulder. “You could be ten times the surgeon I am. Don’t\ndream the small dreams of other men. Our grandfathers bought and worked\nus to the second nahn so that we could have full citizenship and the right of\ntravel. Don’t waste that on killing.”\nKal hesitated, but soon found himself nodding.\n“Three of sixteen ruled, but now the Broken One reigns.”\n—Collected: Chachanan, 1173, 84 seconds pre-death. Subject: a\ncutpurse with the wasting sickness, of partial Iriali descent.\nThe highstorm eventually subsided. It was the dusk of the day the boy had\ndied, the day Syl had left him. Kaladin slid on his sandals—the same ones\nhe’d taken from the leathery-faced man on that first day—and stood up. He\nwalked through the crowded barrack.\nThere were no beds, just one thin blanket per bridgeman. One had to\nchoose whether to use it for cushioning or warmth. You could freeze or you\ncould ache.

Those were a bridgeman’s options, though several of the\nbridgemen had found a third use for the blankets. They wrapped them\naround their heads, as if to block out sight, sound, and smell. To hide from\nthe world.\nThe world would find them anyway. It was good at these kinds of\ngames.\nRain fell in sheets outside, the wind still stiff. Flashes lit the western\nhorizon, where the center of the storm flew onward. This was an hour or so\nbefore the riddens, and was as early as one would want to go out in a\nhighstorm.\nWell, one never wanted to go out in a highstorm. But this was about as\nearly as it was safe to go out. The lightning had passed; the winds were\nmanageable.\nHe passed through the dim lumberyard, hunched against the wind.\nBranches lay scattered about like bones in a whitespine’s lair. Leaves were\nplastered by rainwater to the rough sides of barracks. Kaladin splashed\nthrough puddles that chilled and numbed his feet. That felt good; they were\nstill sore from the bridge run earlier.\nWaves of icy rain blew across him, wetting his hair, dripping down his\nface and into his scruffy beard. He hated having a beard, particularly the\nway the whiskers itched at the corners of his mouth. Beards were like\naxehound pups. Boys dreamed of the day they’d get one, never realizing\nhow annoying they could be.\n“Out for a stroll, Your Lordship?” a voice said.\nKaladin looked up to find Gaz huddled in a nearby hollow between\ntwo of the barracks. Why was he out in the rain?\nAh. Gaz had fastened a small metal basket on the leeward wall of one\nof the barracks, and a soft glowing light came from within. He left his\nspheres out in the storm, then had come out early to retrieve them.\nIt was a risk. Even a sheltered basket could get torn free. Some people\nbelieved that the shades of the Lost Radiants haunted the storms, stealing\nspheres. Perhaps that was true. But during his time in the army, Kaladin had\nknown more than one man who had been wounded sneaking around during\nfull storm, looking for spheres. No doubt the superstition was due to more\nworldly thieves.\nThere were safer ways to infuse spheres. Moneychangers would\nexchange dun spheres for infused ones, or you could pay them to infuse\nyours in one of their safely guarded nests.\n“What are you doing?” Gaz demanded. The short, one-eyed man\nclutched the basket to his chest. “I’ll have you strung up if you’ve stolen\nanyone’s spheres.”\nKaladin turned away from him.\n“Storm you! I’ll have you strung up anyway! Don’t think you can run\naway; there are still sentries. You—”\n“I’m going to the Honor Chasm,” Kaladin said quietly. His voice\nwould barely be audible over the storm.\nGaz shut up. The Honor Chasm. He lowered his metal basket and\nmade no further objections. There was a certain deference given to men\nwho took that road.\nKaladin continued to cross the courtyard.\n“Lordling,” Gaz called.\nKaladin turned."

That left him in a\ndirty shirt and stiff brown trousers, both taken off a dead man.\nKaladin walked through the storm to the east side of the lumberyard. A\nlow thundering rumbled from the west. The pathway down to the Shattered\nPlains was familiar to him now. He’d run this way a dozen times with the\nbridge crews. There wasn’t a battle every day—perhaps one in every two or\nthree—and not every bridge crew had to go on every run. But many of the\nruns were so draining, so horrific, that they left the bridgemen stunned,\nalmost unresponsive, for the days between.\nMany bridgemen had trouble making decisions. The same happened to\nmen who were shocked by battle. Kaladin felt those effects in himself. Even\ndeciding to come to the chasm had been difficult.\nBut the bleeding eyes of that unnamed boy haunted him. He wouldn’t\nmake himself go through something like that again. He couldn’t.\nHe reached the base of the slope, wind-driven rain pelting his face as if\ntrying to shove him back toward the camp. He kept on, walking up to the\nnearest chasm. The Honor Chasm, the bridgemen called it, for it was the\nplace where they could make the one decision left to them. The “honorable”\ndecision. Death.\nThey weren’t natural, these chasms. This one started narrow, but as it\nran toward the east, it grew wider—and deeper—incredibly quickly. At only\nten feet long, the crack was already wide enough that it would be difficult to\njump. A group of six rope ladders with wooden rungs hung here, affixed to\nspikes in the rock, used by bridgemen sent down to salvage from corpses\nthat had fallen into the chasms during bridge runs.\nKaladin looked out over the plains. He couldn’t see much through the\ndarkness and rain. No, this place wasn’t natural. The land had been broken.\nAnd now it broke the people who came to it. Kaladin walked past the\nladders, a little farther along the edge of the chasm. Then he sat down, legs\nover the side, looking down as the rain fell around him, the droplets\nplunging into the dark depths.\nTo his sides, the more adventurous cremlings had already left their\nlairs, scuttling about, feeding on plants that lapped up the rainwater. Lirin\nhad once explained that highstorm rains were rich with nutrients.\nStormwardens in Kholinar and Vedenar had proven that plants given storm\nwater did better than those given lake or river water. Why was it that\nscientists were so excited to discover facts that farmers had known for\ngenerations and generations?\nKaladin watched the drops of water streaking down toward oblivion in\nthe crevasse. Little suicidal jumpers. Thousands upon thousands of them.\nMillions upon millions. Who knew what awaited them in that darkness?"

Who knew what awaited them in that darkness?\nYou couldn’t see it, couldn’t know it, until you joined them. Leaping off\ninto the void and letting the wind bear you down…\n“You were right, Father,” Kaladin whispered. “You can’t stop a storm\nby blowing harder. You can’t save men by killing others. We should all\nbecome surgeons. Every last one of us….”\nHe was rambling. But, oddly, his mind felt clearer now than it had in\nweeks. Perhaps it was the clarity of perspective. Most men spent their entire\nlives wondering about the future. Well, his future was empty now. So he\nturned backward, thinking about his father, about Tien, about decisions.\nOnce, his life had seemed simple. That was before he’d lost his\nbrother, before he’d been betrayed in Amaram’s army. Would Kaladin go\nback to those innocent days, if he could? Would he prefer to pretend\neverything was simple?\nNo. He’d had no easy fall, like those drops. He’d earned his scars.\nHe’d bounced off walls, bashed his face and hands. He’d killed innocent\nmen by accident. He’d walked beside those with hearts like blackened\ncoals, adoring them. He’d scrambled and climbed and fallen and stumbled.\nAnd now here he was. At the end of it all. Understanding so much\nmore, but somehow feeling no wiser. He climbed to his feet on the lip of\nthat chasm, and could feel his father’s disappointment looming over him,\nlike the thunderheads above.\nHe put one foot out over the void.\n“Kaladin!”\nHe froze at the soft but piercing voice. A translucent form bobbed in\nthe air, approaching through the weakening rain. The figure lunged forward,\nthen sank, then surged higher again, like it was bearing something heavy.\nKaladin brought his foot back and held out his hand. Syl unceremoniously\nalighted upon it, shaped like a skyeel clutching something dark in its mouth.\nShe switched to the familiar form of a young woman, dress fluttering\naround her legs. She held in her hands a narrow, dark green leaf with a point\ndivided in three. Blackbane.\n“What is this?” Kaladin asked.\nShe looked exhausted. “These things are heavy!” She lifted the leaf. “I\nbrought it for you!”\nHe took the leaf between two fingers. Blackbane. Poison. “Why did\nyou bring this to me?” he said harshly.\n“I thought…” Syl said, shying back. “Well, you kept those other leaves\nso carefully. Then you lost them when you tried to help that man in the\nslave cages. I thought it would make you happy to have another one.”\nKaladin almost laughed. She had no concept of what she’d done,\nfetching him a leaf of one of Roshar’s most deadly natural poisons because\nshe’d wanted to make him happy. It was ridiculous. And sweet.\n“Everything seemed to go wrong when you lost that leaf,” Syl said in a\nsoft voice. “Before that, you fought.”\n“I failed.”\nShe cowered down, kneeling on his palm, misty skirt around her legs,"

I flew so far…I almost forgot myself. But I came back. I came\nback, Kaladin.”\n“Why?” he pled. “Why do you care?”\n“Because I do,” she said, cocking her head. “I watched you, you know.\nBack in that army. You’d always find the young, untrained men and protect\nthem, even though it put you into danger. I can remember. Just barely, but I\ndo.”\n“I failed them. They’re dead now.”\n“They would have died more quickly without you. You made it so they\nhad a family in the army. I remember their gratitude. It’s what drew me in\nthe first place. You helped them.”\n“No,” he said, clutching the blackbane in his fingers. “Everything I\ntouch withers and dies.” He teetered on the ledge. Thunder rumbled in the\ndistance.\n“Those men in the bridge crew,” Syl whispered. “You could help\nthem.”\n“Too late.” He closed his eyes, thinking of the dead boy earlier in the\nday. “It’s too late. I’ve failed. They’re dead. They’re all going to die, and\nthere’s no way out.”\n“What is one more try, then?” Her voice was soft, yet somehow\nstronger than the storm. “What could it hurt?”\nHe paused.\n“You can’t fail this time, Kaladin. You’ve said it. They’re all going to\ndie anyway.”\nHe thought of Tien, and his dead eyes staring upward.\n“I don’t know what you mean most of the time when you speak,” she\nsaid. “My mind is so cloudy. But it seems that if you’re worried about\nhurting people, you shouldn’t be afraid to help the bridgemen. What more\ncould you do to them?”\n“I…”\n“One more try, Kaladin,” Syl whispered. “Please.”\nOne more try….\nThe men huddled in the barrack with barely a blanket to call their own.\nFrightened of the storm. Frightened of each other. Frightened of what the\nnext day would bring.\nOne more try….\nHe thought of himself, crying at the death of a boy he hadn’t known. A\nboy he hadn’t even tried to help.\nOne more try.\nKaladin opened his eyes. He was cold and wet, but he felt a tiny, warm\ncandle flame of determination come alight inside him. He clenched his\nhand, crushing the blackbane leaf inside, then dropped it over the side of the\nchasm. He lowered the other hand, which had been holding Syl.\nShe zipped up into the air, anxious. “Kaladin?”\nHe stalked away from the chasm, bare feet splashing in puddles and\nstepping heedlessly on rockbud vines. The incline he’d come down was\ncovered with flat, slatelike plants that had opened like books to the rain,\nruffled lacy red and green leaves connecting the two halves. Lifespren—\nlittle green blips of light, brighter than Syl but small as spores—danced\namong the plants, dodging raindrops."

Lifespren—\nlittle green blips of light, brighter than Syl but small as spores—danced\namong the plants, dodging raindrops.\nKaladin strode up, water streaming past him in tiny rivers. At the top,\nhe returned to the bridge yard. It was still empty save for Gaz, who was\ntying a ripped tarp back into place.\nKaladin had crossed most of the distance to the man before Gaz\nnoticed him. The wiry sergeant scowled. “Too cowardly to go through with\nit, Your Lordship? Well, if you think I’m giving back—”\nHe cut off with a gagging noise as Kaladin lunged forward, grabbing\nGaz by the neck. Gaz lifted an arm in surprise, but Kaladin batted it away\nand swept the man’s legs out from under him, slamming him down to the\nrocky ground, throwing up a splash of water. Gaz’s eyes opened wide with\nshock and pain, and he began to strangle under the pressure of Kaladin’s\ngrip on his throat.\n“The world just changed, Gaz,” Kaladin said, leaning in close. “I died\ndown at that chasm. Now you’ve got my vengeful spirit to deal with.”\nSquirming, Gaz looked about frantically for help that wasn’t there.\nKaladin didn’t have trouble holding him down. There was one thing about\nrunning bridges: If you survived long enough, it built up the muscles.\nKaladin let up slightly on Gaz’s neck, allowing him a gasping breath.\nThen Kaladin leaned down further. “We’re going to start over new, you and\nI. Clean. And I want you to understand something from the start. I’m\nalready dead. You can’t hurt me. Understand?”\nGaz nodded slowly and Kaladin gave him another breath of frigid,\nhumid air.\n“Bridge Four is mine,” Kaladin said. “You can assign us tasks, but I’m\nbridgeleader. The other one died today, so you have to pick a new leader\nanyway. Understand?”\nGaz nodded again.\n“You learn quickly,” Kaladin said, letting the man breathe freely. He\nstepped back, and Gaz hesitantly got to his feet. There was hatred in his\neyes, but it was veiled. He seemed worried about something—something\nmore than Kaladin’s threats.\n“I want to stop paying down my slave debt,” Kaladin said. “How much\ndo bridgemen make?”\n“Two clearmarks a day,” Gaz said, scowling at him and rubbing his\nneck.\nSo a slave would make half that. One diamond mark. A pittance, but\nKaladin would need it. He’d also need to keep Gaz in line. “I’ll start taking\nmy wages,” Kaladin said, “but you get to keep one mark in five.”\nGaz started, glancing at him in the dim, overcast light.\n“For your efforts,” Kaladin said.\n“For what efforts?”\nKaladin stepped up to him. “Your efforts in staying the Damnation out\nof my way.

One mark every five days wasn’t much of a\nreminder—but for a man who was willing to risk going out in the middle of\na highstorm to protect his spheres, it might be enough.\nKaladin walked back to Bridge Four’s small barrack, pulling open the\nthick wooden door. The men huddled inside, just as he’d left them. But\nsomething had changed. Had they always looked that pathetic?\nYes. They had. Kaladin was the one who had changed, not they. He felt\na strange dislocation, as if he’d allowed himself to forget—if only in part—\nthe last nine months. He reached back across time, studying the man he had\nbeen. The man who’d still fought, and fought well.\nHe couldn’t be that man again—he couldn’t erase the scars—but he\ncould learn from that man, as a new squadleader learned from the\nvictorious generals of the past. Kaladin Stormblessed was dead, but Kaladin\nBridgeman was of the same blood. A descendant with potential.\nKaladin walked to the first huddled figure. The man wasn’t sleeping—\nwho could sleep through a highstorm? The man cringed as Kaladin knelt\nbeside him.\n“What’s your name?” Kaladin asked, Syl flitting down and studying\nthe man’s face. He wouldn’t be able to see her.\nThe man was older, with drooping cheeks, brown eyes, and close-\ncropped, white-salted hair. His beard was short and he didn’t have a slave\nmark.\n“Your name?” Kaladin repeated firmly.\n“Storm off,” the man said, rolling over.\nKaladin hesitated, then leaned in, speaking in a low voice. “Look,\nfriend. You can either tell me your name, or I’ll keep pestering you.\nContinue refusing, and I’ll tow you out into that storm and hang you over\nthe chasm by one leg until you tell me.”\nThe man glanced back over his shoulder. Kaladin nodded slowly,\nholding the man’s gaze.\n“Teft,” the man finally said. “My name’s Teft.”\n“That wasn’t so hard,” Kaladin said, holding out his hand. “I’m\nKaladin. Your bridgeleader.”\nThe man hesitated, then took Kaladin’s hand, wrinkling his brow in\nconfusion. Kaladin vaguely remembered the man. He’d been in the crew for\na while, a few weeks at least. Before that, he’d been on another bridge crew.\nOne of the punishments for bridgemen who committed camp infractions\nwas a transfer to Bridge Four.\n“Get some rest,” Kaladin said, releasing Teft’s hand. “We’re going to\nhave a hard day tomorrow.”\n“How do you know?” Teft asked, rubbing his bearded chin.\n“Because we’re bridgemen,” Kaladin said, standing. “Every day is\nhard.”\nTeft hesitated, then smiled faintly. “Kelek knows that’s true.”\nKaladin left him, moving down the line of huddled figures.

It was as if their names were the last things they owned, and\nwouldn’t be given up cheaply, though they seemed surprised—perhaps even\nencouraged—that someone cared to ask.\nHe clutched to these names, repeating each one in his head, holding\nthem like precious gemstones. The names mattered. The men mattered.\nPerhaps Kaladin would die in the next bridge run, or perhaps he would\nbreak under the strain, and give Amaram one final victory. But as he settled\ndown on the ground to plan, he felt that tiny warmth burning steadily within\nhim.\nIt was the warmth of decisions made and purpose seized. It was\nresponsibility.\nSyl alighted on his leg as he sat, whispering the names of the men to\nhimself. She looked encouraged. Bright. Happy. He didn’t feel any of that.\nHe felt grim, tired, and wet. But he wrapped himself in the responsibility he\nhad taken, the responsibility for these men. He held to it like a climber\nclung to his last handhold as he dangled from a cliffside.\nHe would find a way to protect them.\nTHE END OF\nPart One\nIshikk splashed toward the meeting with the strange foreigners, whistling\nsoftly to himself, his pole with buckets on each end resting on his shoulders.\nHe wore lake sandals on his submerged feet and a pair of knee-length\nbreeches. No shirt. Nu Ralik forbid! A good Purelaker never covered his\nshoulders when the sun was shining. A man could get sick that way, not\ngetting enough sunlight.\nHe whistled, but not because he was having a pleasant day. In point of\nfact, the day Nu Ralik had provided was close to horrible. Only five fish\nswam in Ishikk’s buckets, and four were of the dullest, most common\nvariety. The tides had been irregular, as if the Purelake itself was in a foul\nmood. Bad days were coming; sure as the sun and the tide, they were.\nThe Purelake extended in all directions, hundreds of miles wide, its\nglassy surface perfectly transparent. At its deepest, it was never more than\nsix feet from shimmering surface to the bottom—and in most places, the\nwarm, slow-moving water came up only to about mid calf. It was filled with\ntiny fish, colorful cremlings, and eel-like riverspren.\nThe Purelake was life itself. Once, this land had been claimed by a\nking. Sela Tales, the nation had been called, one of the Epoch Kingdoms.\nWell, they could name it what they wanted, but Nu Ralik knew that the\nboundaries of nature were far more important than the boundaries of\nnations. Ishikk was a Purelaker. First and foremost. By tide and sun he was.\nHe walked confidently through the water, though the footing could\nsometimes be precarious. The pleasantly warm water lapped at his legs just\nbelow the knees, and he made very few splashes.

Their domed roofs made\nthem look like the rockbuds that sprouted from the ground, and they were\nthe only things for miles around that broke the surface of the Purelake.\nOther people walked about here, moving with the same slow gait. It\nwas possible to run through the water, but there was rarely a reason. What\ncould be so important that you had to go and make a splash and ruckus\ngetting to it?\nIshikk shook his head at that. Only foreigners were so hasty. He\nnodded to Thaspic, a dark-skinned man who passed him pulling a small raft.\nIt was stacked with a few piles of cloth; he’d probably taken them out for\nwashing.\n“Ho, Ishikk,” the scrawny man said. “How’s fishing?”\n“Terrible,” he called. “Vun Makak has blighted me right good today.\nAnd you?”\n“Lost a shirt while washing,” Thaspic replied, his voice pleasant.\n“Ah, that’s the way of things. Are my foreigners here?”\n“Sure are. Over at Maib’s place.”\n“Vun Makak send they don’t eat her out of home,” Ishikk said,\ncontinuing on his way. “Or infect her with their constant worries.”\n“Sun and tides send it!” Thaspic said with a chuckle, continuing on.\nMaib’s house was near the center of the village. Ishikk wasn’t sure\nwhat made her want to live inside the building. Most nights he did just fine\nsleeping on his raft. It never got cold in the Purelake, except during\nhighstorms, and you could last through those right well, Nu Ralik send the\nway.\nThe Purelake drained into pits and holes when the storms came, and so\nyou just shoved your raft into a crevice between two ridges of stone and\nhuddled up next to it, using it to break the fury of the tempest. The storms\nweren’t so bad out here as they were in the East, where they flung boulders\nand blew down buildings. Oh, he’d heard stories about that sort of life. Nu\nRalik send he never had to go to such a terrible place.\nBesides, it was probably cold there. Ishikk pitied those who had to live\nin the cold. Why didn’t they just come to the Purelake?\nNu Ralik send that they don’t, he thought, walking up to Maib’s place.\nIf everyone knew how nice the Purelake was, surely they’d all want to live\nhere, and there wouldn’t be a place to walk without stumbling over some\nforeigner!\nHe stepped up into the building, exposing his calves to the air. The\nfloor was low enough that a few inches of water still covered it; Purelakers\nliked it that way. It was natural, though if the tide dropped, sometimes\nbuildings would drain.\nMinnows shot out around his toes.

She was\na stout woman and had been chasing Ishikk for years, trying to bait him to\nwed her on account of her fine cooking. He just might let her catch him\nsomeday.\nHis foreigners were in the corner, at a table only they would choose—\nthe one that was raised up an extra bit, with footrests so that the outsiders\nwouldn’t have to get their toes wet. Nu Ralik, what fools! he thought with\namusement. Inside out of the sun, wearing shirts against its warmth, feet\nout of the tide. No wonder their thoughts are so odd.\nHe set his buckets down, nodding to Maib.\nShe eyed him. “Good fishing?”\n“Terrible.”\n“Ah well, your soup is free today, Ishikk. To make up for Vun Makak’s\ncursing.”\n“Thanks much kindly,” he said, taking a steaming bowl from her. She\nsmiled. Now he owed her. Enough bowls, and he’d be forced to wed her.\n“There’s a kolgril in the bucket for you,” he noted. “Caught it early\nthis morning.”\nHer stout face grew uncertain. A kolgril was a very lucky fish. Cured\naching joints for a good month after you ate it, and sometimes let you see\nwhen friends were going to visit by letting you read the shapes of the\nclouds. Maib had quite a fondness for them, on account of the finger aches\nNu Ralik had sent her. One kolgril would be two weeks of soup, and would\nput her in debt to him.\n“Vun Makak eye you,” she muttered in annoyance walking over to\ncheck. “That’s one all right. How am I ever going to catch you, man?”\n“I’m a fisher, Maib,” he said, taking a slurp of his soup—the bowl was\nshaped for easy slurping. “Hard to catch a fisher. You know that.” He\nchuckled to himself, walking up to his foreigners as she plucked out the\nkolgril.\nThere were three of them. Two were dark-skinned Makabaki, though\nthey were the strangest Makabaki he’d ever seen. One was thick limbed\nwhere most of his kind were small and fine-boned, and he had a completely\nbald head. The other was taller, with short dark hair, lean muscles, and\nbroad shoulders. In his head, Ishikk called them Grump and Blunt, on\naccount of their personalities.\nThe third man had light tan skin, like an Alethi. He didn’t seem quite\nright either, though. The eyes were the wrong shape, and his accent was\ncertainly not Alethi. He spoke the Selay language worse than the other two,\nand usually stayed quiet. He seemed thoughtful, though. Ishikk called him\nThinker.\nWonder how he earned that scar across his scalp, Ishikk thought. Life\noutside the Purelake was very dangerous. Lots of wars, particularly to the\neast.\n“You are late, traveler,” said tall, stiff Blunt. He had the build and air\nof a soldier, though none of the three carried weapons."

He had the build and air\nof a soldier, though none of the three carried weapons.\nIshikk frowned, sitting and reluctantly pulling his feet out of the water.\n“Isn’t it warli-day?”\n“The day is right, friend,” Grump said. “But we were to meet at noon.\nUnderstand?” He generally did most of the talking.\n“We’re close to that,” Ishikk said. Honestly. Who paid attention to\nwhat hour it was? Foreigners. Always so busy.\nGrump just shook his head as Maib brought them some soup. Her\nplace was the closest thing the village had to an inn. She left Ishikk a soft\ncloth napkin and nice cup of sweet wine, trying to balance that fish as\nquickly as possible.\n“Very well,” Grump said. “Let us have your report, friend.”\n“I’ve been by Fu Ralis, Fu Namir, Fu Albast, and Fu Moorin this\nmonth,” Ishikk said, taking a slurp of soup. “Nobody has seen this man you\nsearch for.”\n“You asked right questions?” Blunt said. “You are certain?”\n“Of course I’m certain,” Ishikk said. “I have been doing this for ages\nnow.”\n“Five months,” Blunt corrected. “And no results.”\nIshikk shrugged. “You wish me to make up stories? Vun Makak would\nlike me to do that.”\n“No, no stories, friend,” Grump said. “We want only the truth.”\n“Well, I’ve given it to you.”\n“You swear it by Nu Ralik, that god of yours?”\n“Hush!” Ishikk said. “Don’t say his name. Are you idiots?”\nGrump frowned. “But he is your god. Understand? Is his name holy?\nNot to be spoken?”\nForeigners were so stupid. Of course Nu Ralik was their god, but you\nalways pretended that he wasn’t. Vun Makak—his younger, spiteful brother\n—had to be tricked into thinking you worshipped him, otherwise he’d get\njealous. It was only safe to speak of these things in a holy grotto.\n“I swear it by Vun Makak,” Ishikk said pointedly. “May he watch over\nme and curse me as he pleases. I have looked diligently. No foreigner like\nthis one you mention—with his white hair, clever tongue, and arrowlike\nface—has been seen.”\n“He dyes his hair sometimes,” Grump said. “And wears disguises.”\n“I’ve asked, using the names you gave me,” Ishikk said. “Nobody has\nseen him. Now, perhaps I could find you a fish that could locate him.”\nIshikk rubbed his stubbly chin. “I’ll bet a stumpy cort could do it. Might\ntake me a while to find one, though.”\nThe three looked at him. “There may be something to these fish, you\nknow,” Blunt said.\n“Superstition,” Grump replied. “You always look for superstition,\nVao.”\nVao wasn’t the man’s real name; Ishikk was sure they used fake\nnames. That was why he used his own names for them. If they were going\nto give him fake names, he’d give them fake names back."

He nodded to Ishikk, who was still\nslurping his soup. All three of them switched to another language and\ncontinued their argument.\nIshikk listened with half an ear, trying to determine what language it\nwas. He never had been good with other kinds of languages. Why did he\nneed them? Didn’t help with fishing or selling fish.\nHe had searched for their man. He got around a lot, visited a lot of\nplaces around the Purelake. It was one of the reasons why he didn’t want to\nbe caught by Maib. He’d have to settle down, and that wasn’t good for\ncatching fish. Not the rare ones, at least.\nHe didn’t bother wondering why they were looking for this Hoid,\nwhoever he was. Foreigners were always looking for things they couldn’t\nhave. Ishikk sat back, dangling his toes in the water. That felt good.\nEventually, they finished their argument. They gave him some more\ninstructions, handed him a pouch of spheres, and stepped down into the\nwater.\nLike most foreigners, they wore thick boots that came all the way up to\ntheir knees. They splashed in the water as they walked to the entrance.\nIshikk followed, waving to Maib and picking up his buckets. He’d be back\nlater in the day for an evening meal.\nMaybe I should let her catch me, he thought, stepping back out into the\nsunlight and sighing in relief. Nu Ralik knows I’m getting old. Might be nice\nto relax.\nHis foreigners splashed down into the Purelake. Grump was last. He\nseemed very dissatisfied. “Where are you, Roamer? What a fool’s quest this\nis.” Then, he added in his own tongue, “Alavanta kamaloo kayana.”\nHe splashed after his companions.\n“Well, you’ve got the ‘fool’ part right,” Ishikk said with a chuckle,\nturning his own direction and heading off to check on his traps.\nNan Balat liked killing things.\nNot people. Never people. But animals, those he could kill.\nParticularly the little ones. He wasn’t sure why it made him feel better;\nit simply did.\nHe sat on the porch of his mansion, pulling the legs off a small crab\none at a time. There was a satisfying rip to each one—he pulled on it lightly\nat first, and the animal grew stiff. Then he pulled harder, and it started to\nsquirm. The ligament resisted, then started ripping, followed by a quick\npop. The crab squirmed some more, and Nan Balat held up the leg, pinching\nthe beast with two fingers on his other hand.\nHe sighed in satisfaction. Ripping a leg free soothed him, made the\naches in his body retreat. He tossed the leg over his shoulder and moved on\nto the next one.\nHe didn’t like to talk about his habit. He didn’t even speak of it to\nEylita. It was just something he did. You had to keep your sanity somehow."

You had to keep your sanity somehow.\nHe finished with the legs, then stood up, leaning on his cane, looking\nout over the Davar gardens, which were made up of stonework walls\ncovered with different kinds of vines. They were beautiful, though Shallan\nhad been the only one who truly appreciated them. This area of Jah Keved\n—to the west and south of Alethkar, of higher elevation and broken by\nmountains such as the Horneater Peaks—had a profusion of vines. They\ngrew on everything, covering the mansion, growing over the steps. Out in\nthe wilds, they hung from trees, grew over rocky expanses, as ubiquitous as\ngrass was in other areas of Roshar.\nBalat walked to the edge of the porch. Some wild songlings began to\nsing in the distance, scraping their ridged shells. They each played a\ndifferent beat and notes, though they couldn’t really be called melodies.\nMelodies were things of humans, not animals. But each one was a song, and\nat times they seemed to sing back and forth to one another.\nBalat walked down the steps one at a time, the vines shaking and\npulling away before his feet fell. It had been nearly six months since\nShallan’s departure. This morning, they’d had word from her via spanreed\nthat she’d succeeded in the first part of her plan, becoming Jasnah Kholin’s\nward. And so, his baby sister—who before this had never left their estates—\nwas preparing to rob the most important woman in the world.\nWalking down the steps was depressingly hard work for him. Twenty-\nthree years old, he thought, and already a cripple. He still felt a constant,\nlatent ache. The break had been bad, and the surgeon had nearly decided to\ncut off the entire leg. Perhaps he could be thankful that hadn’t proven\nnecessary, though he would always walk with a cane.\nScrak was playing with something in the sitting green, a place where\ncultivated grass was grown and kept free of vines. The large axehound\nrolled about, gnawing at the object, antennae pulled back flat against her\nskull.\n“Scrak,” Balat said, hobbling forward, “what have you got there, girl?”\nThe axehound looked up at her master, antennae cocking upward. The\nhound trumped with two echoing voices overlapping one another, then went\nback to playing.\nBlasted creature, Balat thought fondly, never would obey properly.\nHe’d been breeding axehounds since his youth, and had discovered—as had\nmany before him—that the smarter an animal was, the more likely it was to\ndisobey. Oh, Scrak was loyal, but she’d ignore you on the little things. Like\na young child trying to prove her independence.\nAs he got closer, he saw that Scrak had managed to catch a songling.\nThe fist-sized creature was shaped like a peaked disc with four arms that\nreached out from the sides and scraped rhythms along the top. Four squat\nlegs underneath normally held it to a rock wall, though Scrak had chewed\nthose off. She had two of the arms off too, and had managed to crack the"

Balat almost took it away to pull the other two arms off, but decided it\nwas best to let Scrak have her fun.\nScrak set the songling down and looked up at Balat, her antennae\nrising inquisitively. She was sleek and lean, six legs extending before her as\nshe sat on her haunches. Axehounds didn’t have shells or skin; instead, their\nbody was covered with some fusion of the two, smooth to the touch and\nmore pliable than true carapace, but harder than skin and made of\ninterlocking sections. The axehound’s angular face seemed curious, her\ndeep black eyes regarding Balat. She trumped softly.\nBalat smiled, reaching down and scratching behind the axehound’s ear\nholes. The animal leaned against him—she probably weighed as much as he\ndid. The bigger axehounds came up to a man’s waist, though Scrak was of a\nsmaller, quicker breed.\nThe songling quivered and Scrak pounced on it eagerly, crunching at\nits shell with her strong outer mandibles.\n“Am I a coward, Scrak?” Balat asked, sitting down on a bench. He set\nhis cane aside and snatched a small crab that had been hiding on the side of\nthe bench, its shell having turned white to match the stone.\nHe held up the squirming animal. The green’s grass had been bred to\nbe less timid, and it poked out of its holes only a few moments after he\npassed. Other exotic plants bloomed, poking out of shells or holes in the\nground, and soon patches of red, orange, and blue waved in the wind\naround him. The area around the axehound remained bare, of course. Scrak\nwas having far too much fun with her prey, and she kept even the cultivated\nplants hidden in their burrows.\n“I couldn’t have gone to chase Jasnah,” Balat said, starting to pull the\ncrab’s legs off. “Only a woman could get close enough to her to steal the\nSoulcaster. We decided that. Besides, someone needs to stay back and care\nfor the needs of the house.”\nThe excuses were hollow. He did feel like a coward. He pulled off a\nfew more legs, but it was unsatisfying. The crab was too small, and the legs\ncame off too easily.\n“This plan probably won’t even work,” he said, taking off the last of\nthe legs. Odd, looking at a creature like this when it had no legs. The crab\nwas still alive. Yet how could you know it? Without the legs to wiggle, the\ncreature seemed as dead as a stone.\nThe arms, he thought, we wave them about to make us seem alive.\nThat’s what they’re good for. He put his fingers between the halves of the\ncrab’s shell and began to pry them apart. This, at least, had a nice feeling of\nresistance to it.\nThey were a broken family. Years of suffering their father’s brutal\ntemper had driven Asha Jushu to vice and Tet Wikim to despair. Only Balat\nhad escaped unscathed. Balat and Shallan. She’d been left alone, never"

At times, Balat had hated her for that, but how could you truly hate\nsomeone like Shallan? Shy, quiet, delicate.\nI should never have let her go, he thought. There should have been\nanother way. She’d never manage on her own; she was probably terrified. It\nwas a wonder she’d done as much as she had.\nHe tossed the pieces of crab over his shoulder. If only Helaran had\nsurvived. Their eldest brother—then known as Nan Helaran, as he’d been\nthe first son—had stood up to their father repeatedly. Well, he was dead\nnow, and so was their father. They’d left behind a family of cripples.\n“Balat!” a voice cried. Wikim appeared on the porch. The younger\nman was past his recent bout of melancholy, it appeared.\n“What?” Balat said, standing.\nWikim rushed down the steps, hurrying up to him, vines—then grass—\npulling back before him. “We have a problem.”\n“How large a problem?”\n“Pretty big, I’d say. Come on.”\nSzeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, sat on the wooden tavern\nfloor, lavis beer slowly soaking through his brown trousers.\nGrimy, worn, and fraying, his clothing was far different from the\nsimple—yet elegant—whites he had worn over five years before when he’d\nassassinated the king of Alethkar.\nHead bowed, hands in his lap, he carried no weapons. He hadn’t\nsummoned his Shardblade in years, and it felt equally long since he’d had a\nbath. He did not complain. If he looked like a wretch, people treated him as\na wretch. One did not ask a wretch to assassinate people.\n“So he’ll do whatever you say?” asked one of the mine workers sitting\nat the table. The man’s clothing was little better than Szeth’s, covered with\nso much dirt and dust that it was difficult to tell grimy skin from grimy\ncloth. There were four of them, holding ceramic cups. The room smelled of\nmud and sweat. The ceiling was low, the windows—on the leeward side\nonly—mere slots. The table was precariously held together with several\nleather straps, as the wood was cracked down the middle.\nTook—Szeth’s current master—set his cup down on the table’s tilted\nside. It sagged under the weight of his arm. “Yeah, he sure will. Hey, kurp,\nlook at me.”\nSzeth looked up. “Kurp” meant child in the local Bav dialect. Szeth\nwas accustomed to such pejorative labels. Though he was in his thirty-fifth\nyear—and his seventh year since being named Truthless—his people’s\nlarge, round eyes, shorter stature, and tendency toward baldness led\nEasterners to claim they looked like children.\n“Stand up,” Took said.\nSzeth did so.\n“Jump up and down.”\nSzeth complied.\n“Pour Ton’s beer on your head.”\nSzeth reached for it."

Oi ain’t\ndone with this yet!”\n“If you were,” said Took, “he couldn’t right pour it on his head, could\nhe?”\n“Get ’im to do something else, Took,” Ton griped.\n“All right.” Took pulled out his boot knife and tossed it to Szeth.\n“Kurp, cut your arm up.”\n“Took…” said one of the other men, a sniffly man named Amark.\n“That ain’t right, you know it.”\nTook didn’t rescind the order, so Szeth complied, taking the knife and\ncutting at the flesh of his arm. Blood seeped out around the dirty blade.\n“Cut your throat,” Took said.\n“Now, Took!” Amark said, standing. “Oi won’t—”\n“Oh hush, you,” Took said. Several groups of men from other tables\nwere watching now. “You’ll see. Kurp, cut your throat.”\n“I am forbidden to take my own life,” Szeth said softly in the Bav\nlanguage. “As Truthless, it is the nature of my suffering to be forbidden the\ntaste of death by my own hand.”\nAmark settled back down, looking sheepish.\n“Dustmother,” Ton said, “he always talks like that?”\n“Like what?” Took asked, taking a gulp from his mug.\n“Smooth words, so soft and proper. Like a lighteyes.”\n“Yeah,” Took said. “He’s like a slave, only better ’cuz he’s a Shin. He\ndon’t run or talk back or anything. Don’t have to pay him, neither. He’s like\na parshman, but smarter. Worth a right many spheres, Oi’d say.” He eyed\nthe other men. “Could take him to the mines with you to work, and collect\nhis pay. He’d do things you don’t wanna. Muck out the privy, whitewash\nthe home. All kinds of useful stuff.”\n“Well, how’d you come by him, then?” one of the other men asked,\nscratching his chin. Took was a transient worker, moving from town to\ntown. Displaying Szeth was one of the ways he made quick friends.\n“Oh, now, that’s a story,” Took said. “Oi was traveling in the\nmountains down south, you know, and Oi heard this weird howling noise. It\nwasn’t joust the wind, you know, and…”\nThe tale was a complete fabrication; Szeth’s previous master—a\nfarmer in a nearby village—had traded Szeth to Took for a sack of seeds.\nThe farmer had gotten him from a traveling merchant, who had gotten him\nfrom a cobbler who’d won him in an illegal game of chance. There had\nbeen dozens before him.\nAt first, the darkeyed commoners enjoyed the novelty of owning him.\nSlaves were far too expensive for most, and parshmen were even more\nvaluable.

Some treated him well, some did not.\nBut they always got rid of him.\nPerhaps they could sense the truth, that he was capable of so much\nmore than they dared use him for. It was one thing to have a slave of your\nown. But when that slave talked like a lighteyes and knew more than you\ndid? It made them uncomfortable.\nSzeth tried to play the part, tried to make himself act less refined. It\nwas very difficult for him. Perhaps impossible. What would these men say\nif they knew that the man who emptied their chamber pot was a Shardbearer\nand a Surgebinder? A Windrunner, like the Radiants of old? The moment he\nsummoned his Blade, his eyes would turn from dark green to pale—almost\nglowing—sapphire, a unique effect of his particular weapon.\nBest that they never discovered. Szeth gloried in being wasted; each\nday he was made to clean or dig instead of kill was a victory. That evening\nfive years ago still haunted him. Before then, he had been ordered to kill—\nbut always in secret, silently. Never before had he been given such\ndeliberately terrible instructions.\nKill, destroy, and cut your way to the king. Be seen doing it. Leave\nwitnesses. Wounded but alive….\n“…and that is when he swore to serve me my entire life,” Took\nfinished. “He’s been with me ever since.”\nThe listening men turned to Szeth. “It is true,” he said, as he’d been\nordered earlier. “Every word of it.”\nTook smiled. Szeth didn’t make him uncomfortable; he apparently\nconsidered it natural that Szeth obeyed him. Perhaps as a result he would\nremain Szeth’s master longer than the others.\n“Well,” Took said, “Oi should be going. Need to get an early start\ntomorrow. More places to see, more unseen roads to dare…”\nHe liked to think of himself as a seasoned traveler, though as far as\nSzeth could tell, he just moved around in a wide circle. There were many\nsmall mines—and therefore small villages—in this part of Bavland. Took\nhad probably been to this same village years back, but the mines made for a\nlot of transient workers. It was unlikely he’d be remembered, unless\nsomeone had noted his terribly exaggerated stories.\nTerrible or not, the other miners seemed to thirst for more. They urged\nhim on, offering him another drink, and he modestly agreed.\nSzeth sat quietly, legs folded, hands in his lap, blood trickling down his\narm. Had the Parshendi known what they were consigning him to by tossing\nhis Oathstone away as they fled Kholinar that night? Szeth had been\nrequired to recover it, then stand there beside the road, wondering if he\nwould be discovered and executed—hoping he’d be discovered and\nexecuted—until a passing merchant had cared enough to inquire. By then,\nSzeth had stood only in a loincloth. His honor had forced him to discard the\nwhite clothing, as it would have made him easier to recognize.

        "text": "white clothing, as it would have made him easier to recognize. He had to\npreserve himself so that he could suffer.\nAfter a short explanation that left out incriminating details, Szeth had\nfound himself riding in the back of the merchant’s cart. The merchant—a\nman named Avado—had been clever enough to realize that in the wake of\nthe king’s death, foreigners might be treated poorly. He’d made his way to\nJah Keved, never knowing that he harbored Gavilar’s murderer as his\nserving man.\nThe Alethi didn’t search for him. They assumed that he, the infamous\n“Assassin in White,” had retreated with the Parshendi. They probably\nexpected to discover him in the middle of the Shattered Plains.\nThe miners eventually tired of Took’s increasingly slurred stories.\nThey bid him farewell, ignoring his broad hints that another cup of beer\nwould prompt him to tell his greatest tale: that of the time when he’d seen\nthe Nightwatcher herself and stolen a sphere that glowed black at night.\nThat tale always discomforted Szeth, as it reminded him of the strange\nblack sphere Gavilar had given him. He’d hidden that carefully in Jah\nKeved. He didn’t know what it was, but he didn’t want to risk a master\ntaking it from him.\nWhen nobody offered Took another drink, he reluctantly stumbled\nfrom his chair and waved Szeth to follow him from the tavern. The street\nwas dark outside. This town, Ironsway, had a proper town square, several\nhundred homes, and three different taverns. That made it practically a\nmetropolis for Bavland—the small, mostly-ignored stretch of land just\nsouth of the Horneater Peaks. The area was technically part of Jah Keved,\nbut even its highprince tended to stay away from it.\nSzeth followed his master through the streets toward the poorer\ndistrict. Took was too cheap to pay for a room in the nice, or even modest,\nareas of a town. Szeth looked over his shoulder, wishing that the Second\nSister—known as Nomon to these Easterners—had risen to give a little\nmore light.\nTook stumbled drunkenly, then fell over in the street. Szeth sighed. It\nwould not be the first night he carried his master home to his bed. He knelt\nto lift Took.\nHe froze. A warm liquid was pooling beneath his master’s body. Only\nthen did he notice the knife in Took’s neck.\nSzeth instantly came alert as a group of footpads slipped out of the\nalleyway. One raised a hand, the knife in it reflecting starlight, preparing to\nthrow at Szeth. He tensed. There were infused spheres he could draw upon\nin Took’s pouch.\n“Wait,” hissed one of the footpads.\nThe man with the knife paused. Another man came closer, inspecting\nSzeth. “He’s Shin. Won’t hurt a cremling.”\nOthers pulled the corpse into the alleyway. The one with the knife\nraised his weapon again. “He could still yell.”\n“Then why hasn’t he? Oi’m telling you, they’re harmless. Almost like\nparshmen. We can sell him.”\n“Maybe,” the second said. “He’s terrified. Look at ’im.”\n“Come ’ere,” the first footpad said, waving Szeth forward."

Look at ’im.”\n“Come ’ere,” the first footpad said, waving Szeth forward.\nHe obeyed, walking into the alley, which was suddenly illuminated as\nthe other footpads pulled open Took’s pouch.\n“Kelek,” one of them said, “hardly worth the effort. A handful of chips\nand two marks, not a single broam in the lot.”\n“Oi’m telling you,” the first man said. “We can sell this fellow as a\nslave. People like Shin servants.”\n“He’s just a kid.”\n“Nah. They all look like that. Hey, whacha got there?” The man\nplucked a twinkling, sphere-sized chunk of rock from the hand of the man\ncounting the spheres. It was fairly ordinary, a simple piece of rock with a\nfew quartz crystals set into it and a rusty vein of iron on one side. “What is\nthis?”\n“Worthless,” one of the men said.\n“I am required to tell you,” Szeth said quietly, “that you are holding\nmy Oathstone. So long as you possess it, you are my master.”\n“What’s that?” one of the footpads said, standing.\nThe first one closed his hand around the stone, shooting a wary glance\nat the others. He looked back at Szeth. “Your master? What does that mean\nexactly, in precise terms and all?”\n“I must obey you,” Szeth said. “In all things, though I will not follow\nan order to kill myself.” He also couldn’t be ordered to give up his Blade,\nbut there was no need to mention that at the moment.\n“You’ll obey me?” the footpad said. “You mean, you’ll do what Oi\nsay?”\n“Yes.”\n“Anything Oi say?”\nSzeth closed his eyes. “Yes.”\n“Well, ain’t that something interestin’,” the man said, musing.\n“Something interestin’ indeed….”\nPRIME MAP OF THE SHATTERED PLAINS.

        "text": "“I want to listen,” Adolin replied softly.\nHe and his brother rode near the front of the column, near the king and\nhis highprinces. Behind them extended a grand procession: a thousand\nsoldiers in Kholin blue, dozens of servants, and even women in palanquins\nto scribe accounts of the hunt. Adolin glanced at them all as he reached for\nhis canteen.\nHe was wearing his Shardplate, and so he had to be careful when\ngrabbing it, lest he crush it. One’s muscles reacted with increased speed,\nstrength, and dexterity when wearing the armor, and it took practice to use it\ncorrectly. Adolin was still occasionally caught by surprise, though he’d held\nthis suit—inherited from his mother’s side of the family—since his\nsixteenth birthday. That was now seven years past.\nHe turned and took a long drink of lukewarm water. Sadeas rode to the\nking’s left, and Dalinar—Adolin’s father—was a solid figure riding at the\nking’s right. The final highprince on the hunt was Vamah, who wasn’t a\nShardbearer.\nThe king was resplendent in his golden Shardplate—of course, Plate\ncould make any man look regal. Even Sadeas looked impressive when\nwearing his red Plate, though his bulbous face and ruddy complexion\nweakened the effect. Sadeas and the king flaunted their Plate. And…well,\nperhaps Adolin did too. He’d had his painted blue, a few ornamentations\nwelded onto the helm and pauldrons to give an extra look of danger. How\ncould you not show off when wearing something as grand as Shardplate?\nAdolin took another drink, listening to the king talk about his\nexcitement for the hunt. Only one Shardbearer in the procession—indeed,\nonly one Shardbearer in the entirety of the ten armies—used no paint or\nornamentations on his Plate. Dalinar Kholin. Adolin’s father preferred to\nleave his armor its natural slate-grey color.\nDalinar rode beside the king, his face somber. He rode with his helm\ntied to his saddle, exposing a square face topped by short black hair that had\ngone white at the temples. Few women had ever called Dalinar Kholin\nhandsome; his nose was the wrong shape, his features blocky rather than\ndelicate. It was the face of a warrior.\nHe rode astride a massive black Ryshadium stallion, one of the largest\nhorses that Adolin had ever seen—and while the king and Sadeas looked\nregal in their armor, somehow Dalinar managed to look like a soldier. To\nhim, the Plate was not an ornament. It was a tool. He never seemed to be\nsurprised by the strength or speed the armor lent him. It was as if, for\nDalinar Kholin, wearing his Plate was his natural state—it was the times\nwithout that were abnormal. Perhaps that was one reason he’d earned the\nreputation of being one of the greatest warriors and generals who ever lived.\nAdolin found himself wishing, passionately, that his father would do a\nlittle more these days to live up to that reputation.\nHe’s thinking about the visions, Adolin thought, regarding his father’s\ndistant expression and troubled eyes. “It happened again last night,” Adolin"

        "text": "little more these days to live up to that reputation.\nHe’s thinking about the visions, Adolin thought, regarding his father’s\ndistant expression and troubled eyes. “It happened again last night,” Adolin\nsaid softly to Renarin. “During the highstorm.”\n“I know,” Renarin said. His voice was measured, controlled. He\nalways paused before he replied to a question, as if testing the words in his\nmind. Some women Adolin knew said Renarin’s ways made them feel as if\nhe were dissecting them with his mind. They’d shiver when they spoke of\nhim, though Adolin had never found his younger brother the least bit\ndiscomforting.\n“What do you think they mean?” Adolin asked, speaking quietly so\nonly Renarin could hear. “Father’s…episodes.”\n“I don’t know.”\n“Renarin, we can’t keep ignoring them. The soldiers are talking.\nRumors are spreading through all ten armies!”\nDalinar Kholin was going mad. Whenever a highstorm came, he fell to\nthe floor and began to shake. Then he began raving in gibberish. Often, he’d\nstand, blue eyes delusional and wild, swinging and flailing. Adolin had to\nrestrain him lest he hurt himself or others.\n“He sees things,” Adolin said. “Or he thinks he does.”\nAdolin’s grandfather had suffered from delusions. When he’d grown\nold, he’d thought he was back at war. Was that what happened to Dalinar?\nWas he reliving youthful battles, days when he’d earned his renown? Or\nwas it that terrible night he saw over and over, the night when his brother\nhad been murdered by the Assassin in White? And why did he so often\nmention the Knights Radiant soon after his episodes?\nIt all made Adolin feel sick. Dalinar was the Blackthorn, a genius of\nthe battlefield and a living legend. Together, he and his brother had reunited\nAlethkar’s warring highprinces after centuries of strife. He had defeated\ncountless challengers in duels, had won dozens of battles. The entire\nkingdom looked up to him. And now this.\nWhat did you do, as a son, when the man you loved—the greatest man\nalive—started to lose his wits?\nSadeas was speaking about a recent victory. He’d won another\ngemheart two days back, and the king—it appeared—hadn’t heard of it.\nAdolin tensed at the boasts.\n“We should move back,” Renarin said.\n“We are of rank enough to be here,” Adolin said.\n“I don’t like how you get when you’re around Sadeas.”\nWe have to keep an eye on the man, Renarin, Adolin thought. He\nknows Father is weakening. He’ll try to strike. Adolin forced himself to\nsmile, however. He tried to be relaxed and confident for Renarin. Generally,\nthat wasn’t difficult. He’d happily spend his entire life dueling, lounging,\nand courting the occasional pretty girl. Of late, however, life didn’t seem\ncontent to let him enjoy its simple pleasures.\n“…model of courage lately, Sadeas,” the king was saying. “You’ve\ndone very well in capturing gemhearts.

Though the competition grows unexciting,\nas some people don’t seem interested in participating. I guess even the best\nweapons eventually grow dull.”\nDalinar, who might once have responded to the veiled slur, said\nnothing. Adolin gritted his teeth. It was flat-out unconscionable for Sadeas\nto be taking shots at his father in his present state. Perhaps Adolin should\noffer the pompous bastard a challenge. You didn’t duel highprinces—it just\nwasn’t done, not unless you were ready to make a big storm of it. But\nmaybe he was. Maybe—\n“Adolin…” Renarin said warningly.\nAdolin looked to the side. He’d held out his hand, as if to summon his\nBlade. He picked up his reins with the hand instead. Storming man, he\nthought. Leave my father alone.\n“Why don’t we talk about the hunt?” Renarin said. As usual, the\nyounger Kholin rode with a straight back and perfect posture, eyes hidden\nbehind his spectacles, a model of propriety and solemnity. “Aren’t you\nexcited?”\n“Bah,” Adolin said. “I never find hunts as interesting as everyone says\nthey’re going to be. I don’t care how big the beast is—in the end, it’s really\njust butchery.”\nNow, dueling, that was exciting. The feel of the Shardblade in your\nhand, of facing someone crafty, skilled, and careful. Man against man,\nstrength against strength, mind against mind. Hunting some dumb beast just\ncouldn’t compare to that.\n“Maybe you should have invited Janala along,” Renarin said.\n“She wouldn’t have come,” Adolin said. “Not after…well, you know.\nRilla was very vocal yesterday. It was best to just leave.”\n“You really should have been wiser in your treatment of her,” Renarin\nsaid, sounding disapproving.\nAdolin mumbled a noncommittal reply. It wasn’t his fault that his\nrelationships often burned out quickly. Well, technically, this time it was his\nfault. But it wasn’t usually. This was just an oddity\nThe king began complaining about something. Renarin and Adolin had\nlagged behind, and Adolin couldn’t hear what was being said.\n“Let’s ride up closer,” Adolin said, nudging his mount forward.\nRenarin rolled his eyes, but followed.\nUnite them.\nThe words whispered in Dalinar’s mind. He couldn’t rid himself of\nthem. They consumed him as he trotted Gallant across a rocky, boulder-\nstrewn plateau on the Shattered Plains.\n“Shouldn’t we be there by now?” the king asked.\n“We’re still two or three plateaus away from the hunting site, Your\nMajesty,” Dalinar said, distracted. “It will be another hour, perhaps,\nobserving proper protocols. If we had vantage, we could probably see the\npavilion to—”\n“Vantage? Would that rock formation up ahead do?”\n“I suppose,” Dalinar said, inspecting the towerlike length of rock. “We\ncould send scouts to check.”\n“Scouts? Bah. I need a run, Uncle.

I’ll bet you five full broams that I\ncan beat you to the top.” And with that, the king galloped away in a thunder\nof hooves, leaving behind a shocked group of lighteyes, attendants, and\nguards.\n“Storm it!” Dalinar cursed, kicking his horse into motion. “Adolin, you\nhave command! Secure the next plateau, just in case.”\nHis son, who had been lagging behind, nodded sharply. Dalinar\ngalloped after the king, a figure in golden armor and a long blue cape.\nHoofbeats pounded the stone, rock formations whipping past. Ahead, the\nsteep, spike-like spire of rock rose from the lip of the plateau. Such\nformations were common out here on the Shattered Plains.\nCurse that boy. Dalinar still thought of Elhokar as a boy, though the\nking was in his twenty-seventh year. But sometimes he acted like a boy.\nWhy couldn’t he give more warning before leaping into one of these stunts?\nStill, as Dalinar rode, he admitted to himself that it did feel good to\ncharge freely, helm off, face to the wind. His pulse picked up as he got into\nthe race, and he forgave its impetuous beginning. For the moment, Dalinar\nlet himself forget his troubles and the words that had been echoing in his\nhead.\nThe king wanted a race? Well, Dalinar would give him one.\nHe charged past the king. Elhokar’s stallion was a good breed, but it\ncould never match Gallant, who was a full Ryshadium, two hands taller and\nmuch stronger than an ordinary horse. The animals chose their own riders,\nand only a dozen men in all of the warcamps were so fortunate. Dalinar was\none, Adolin another.\nIn seconds, Dalinar reached the formation’s base. He threw himself\nfrom the saddle while Gallant was still moving. He hit hard, but the\nShardplate absorbed the impact, stone crunching beneath his metal boots as\nhe skidded to a stop. Men who hadn’t ever worn Plate—particularly those\nwho were accustomed to its inferior cousin, simple plate and mail—could\nnever understand. Shardplate wasn’t merely armor. It was so much more.\nHe ran to the bottom of the rock formation as Elhokar galloped up\nbehind. Dalinar leaped—Plate-assisted legs propelling him up some eight\nfeet—and grabbed a handhold in the stone. With a heave, he pulled himself\nup, the Plate lending him the strength of many men. The Thrill of contest\nbegan to rise within him. It wasn’t nearly as keen as the Thrill of battle, but\nit was a worthy substitute.\nRock scraped below. Elhokar had begun to climb as well. Dalinar\ndidn’t look down. He kept his eyes fixed on the small natural platform at the\ntop of the forty-foot-high formation. He groped with steel-covered fingers,\nfinding another handhold. The gauntlets covered his hands, but the ancient\narmor somehow transferred sensation to his fingers. It was as if he were\nwearing thin leather gloves."

It was as if he were\nwearing thin leather gloves.\nA scraping sound came from the right, accompanied by a voice cursing\nsoftly. Elhokar had taken a different path, hoping to pass Dalinar, but the\nking had found himself at a section without handholds above. His progress\nwas stalled.\nThe king’s golden Shardplate glittered as he glanced at Dalinar.\nElhokar set his jaw and looked upward, then launched himself in a powerful\nleap toward an outcropping.\nFool boy, Dalinar thought, watching the king seem to hang in the air\nfor a moment before he snatched the projecting rock and dangled. Then the\nking pulled himself up and continued to climb.\nDalinar moved furiously, stone grinding beneath his metal fingertips,\nchips falling free. The wind ruffled his cape. He heaved, strained, and\npushed himself, managing to get just ahead of the king. The top was mere\nfeet away. The Thrill sang at him. He reached for the goal, determined to\nwin. He couldn’t lose. He had to—\nUnite them.\nHe hesitated, not quite certain why, and let his nephew get ahead.\nElhokar hauled himself to his feet atop the rock formation, then\nlaughed in triumph. He turned toward Dalinar, holding out a hand.\n“Stormwinds, Uncle, but you made a fine race of it! At the end there, I\nthought for sure you had me.”\nThe triumph and joy in Elhokar’s face brought a smile to Dalinar’s\nlips. The younger man needed victories these days. Even little ones would\ndo him good. Gloryspren—like tiny golden translucent globes of light—\nbegan to pop into existence around him, attracted by his sense of\naccomplishment. Blessing himself for hesitating, Dalinar took the king’s\nhand, letting Elhokar pull him up. There was just enough room on top of the\nnatural tower for them both.\nBreathing deeply, Dalinar slapped the king on the back with a clank of\nmetal on metal. “That was a fine contest, Your Majesty. And you played it\nvery well.”\nThe king beamed. His golden Shardplate gleamed in the noonday sun;\nhe had his faceplate up, revealing light yellow eyes, a strong nose, and a\nclean-shaven face that was almost too handsome, with its full lips, broad\nforehead, and firm chin. Gavilar had looked like that too, before he’d\nsuffered a broken nose and that terrible scar on his chin.\nBelow them, the Cobalt Guard and some of Elhokar’s attendants rode\nup, including Sadeas. His Plate gleamed red, though he wasn’t a full\nShardbearer—he had only the Plate, not the Blade.\nDalinar looked up. From this height, he could scan a large swath of the\nShattered Plains, and he had an odd moment of familiarity. He felt as if he’d\nbeen atop this vantage point before, looking down at a broken landscape.\nThe moment was gone in a heartbeat.\n“There,” Elhokar said, pointing with a golden, gauntleted hand. “I can\nsee our destination.”"

        "text": "The moment was gone in a heartbeat.\n“There,” Elhokar said, pointing with a golden, gauntleted hand. “I can\nsee our destination.”\nDalinar shaded his eyes, picking out a large cloth pavilion three\nplateaus away, flying the king’s flag. Wide, permanent bridges led there;\nthey were relatively close to the Alethi side of the Shattered Plains, on\nplateaus Dalinar himself maintained. A fully grown chasmfiend living here\nwas his to hunt, the wealth at its heart his privilege to claim.\n“You were correct again, Uncle,” Elhokar said.\n“I try to make a habit of it.”\n“I can’t blame you for that, I suppose. Though I can beat you at a race\nnow and then.”\nDalinar smiled. “I felt like a youth again, chasing after your father on\nsome ridiculous challenge.”\nElhokar’s lips tightened to a thin line, and the gloryspren faded away.\nMentioning Gavilar soured him; he felt others compared him unfavorably to\nthe old king. Unfortunately, he was often right.\nDalinar moved on quickly. “We must have seemed of the ten fools,\ncharging away like that. I do wish you’d given me more notice to prepare\nyour honor guard. This is a war zone.”\n“Bah. You worry too much, Uncle. The Parshendi haven’t attacked this\nclose to our side of the Plains in years.”\n“Well, you seemed worried about your safety two nights ago.”\nElhokar sighed audibly. “How many times must I explain this to you,\nUncle? I can face enemy soldiers with Blade in hand. It’s what they might\nsend when we’re not looking, when all is dark and quiet, that you should be\ntrying to protect me from.”\nDalinar didn’t reply. Elhokar’s nervousness—paranoia, even—\nregarding assassination was strong. But who could blame him, considering\nwhat had happened to his father?\nI’m sorry, brother, he thought, as he did every time he thought of the\nnight when Gavilar had died. Alone, without his brother to protect him.\n“I looked into the matter you asked me about,” Dalinar said, forcing\naway bad memories.\n“You did? What did you discover?”\n“Not much, I’m afraid. There were no traces of trespassers on your\nbalcony, and none of the servants reported any strangers in the area.”\n“There was someone watching me in the darkness that night.”\n“If so, they haven’t returned, Your Majesty. And they left no clues\nbehind.”\nElhokar seemed dissatisfied, and the silence between them grew stark.\nBelow, Adolin met with scouts and prepared for the troop crossing. Elhokar\nhad protested at how many men Dalinar had brought. Most of them\nwouldn’t be needed on the hunt—the Shardbearers, not the soldiers, would\nslay the beast. But Dalinar would see his nephew protected. Parshendi raids\nhad grown less bold during the years of fighting—Alethi scribes guessed\ntheir numbers were a quarter their prior strength, though it was difficult to\njudge—but the king’s presence might be enough to entice them into a\nreckless attack.\nThe winds blew across Dalinar, returning with them that faint\nfamiliarity he’d felt a few minutes before.

A sense of an awful and amazing perspective.\nThat’s it, he thought. I did stand atop a formation like this. It happened\nduring—\nDuring one of his visions. The very first one.\nYou must unite them, the strange, booming words had told him. You\nmust prepare. Build of your people a fortress of strength and peace, a wall\nto resist the winds. Cease squabbling and unite. The Everstorm comes.\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar found himself saying. “I…” He trailed off as\nquickly as he began. What could he say? That he’d been seeing visions?\nThat—in defiance of all doctrine and common sense—he thought those\nvisions might be from the Almighty? That he thought they should withdraw\nfrom the battlefield and go back to Alethkar?\nPure foolishness.\n“Uncle?” the king asked. “What do you want?”\n“Nothing. Come, let’s get back to the others.”\nAdolin twisted one of his hogshide reins around his finger while he sat\nastride his horse, awaiting the next batch of scout reports. He’d managed to\nget his mind off his father and Sadeas, and was instead contemplating just\nhow he was going to explain his falling out with Rilla in a way that would\nearn him some sympathy with Janala.\nJanala loved ancient epic poems; could he phrase the falling out in\ndramatic terms? He smiled, thinking of her luxurious black hair and sly\nsmile. She’d been daring, teasing at him while he was known to be courting\nsomeone else. He could use that too. Maybe Renarin was right, perhaps he\nshould have invited her on the hunt. The prospect of fighting a greatshell\nwould have been far more interesting to him if someone beautiful and long-\nhaired were watching….\n“New scout reports are in, Brightlord Adolin,” Tarilar said, jogging up.\nAdolin turned his mind back to business. He’d taken up position with\nsome members of the Cobalt Guard beside the base of the high rock\nformation where his father and the king were still conversing. Tarilar,\nscoutlord, was a gaunt-faced man with a thick chest and arms. From some\nangles, his head looked so relatively small on his body that it appeared to\nhave been smashed.\n“Proceed,” Adolin said.\n“Advance runners have met with the lead huntmaster and have\nreturned. There are no sightings of Parshendi on any nearby plateaus.\nCompanies Eighteen and Twenty-one are in position, though there are still\neight companies to go.”\nAdolin nodded. “Have Company Twenty-one send some outriders to\nwatch from plateaus fourteen and sixteen. And two each on plateaus six and\neight.”\n“Six and eight? Behind us?”\n“If I were going to ambush the party,” Adolin said, “I’d round back\nthis way and cut us off from fleeing. Do it.”\nTarilar saluted. “Yes, Brightlord.” He hurried away to pass the orders.\n“You really think that’s necessary?” Renarin asked, riding up beside\nAdolin.\n“No. But Father will want it done anyway. You know he will.”\nThere was motion up above. Adolin looked up just in time to see the"

        "text": "Adolin.\n“No. But Father will want it done anyway. You know he will.”\nThere was motion up above. Adolin looked up just in time to see the\nking leap off the rock formation, cape streaming behind him as he fell some\nforty feet to the rock floor. Adolin’s father stood at the lip above, and Adolin\ncould imagine him cursing to himself at what he saw as a foolhardy move.\nShardplate could withstand a fall that far, but it was high enough to be\ndangerous.\nElhokar landed with an audible crack, throwing up chips of stone and a\nlarge puff of Stormlight. He managed to stay upright. Adolin’s father took a\nsafer way down, descending to a lower ledge before jumping.\nHe seems to take the safer pathway more and more often lately, Adolin\nthought idly. And he often seems to find reasons to give me command as\nwell. Thoughtful, Adolin trotted his horse out of the shadow of the rock\nformation. He needed to get a report from the rear guard—his father would\nwant to hear it.\nHis path took him past a group of lighteyes from Sadeas’s party. The\nking, Sadeas, and Vamah each had a collection of attendants, aides, and\nsycophants accompanying them. Looking at them riding in their\ncomfortable silks, open-fronted jackets, and shade-covered palanquins\nmade Adolin aware of his sweaty, bulky armor. Shardplate was wonderful\nand empowering, but beneath a hot sun, it could still leave a man wishing\nfor something less confining.\nBut, of course, he couldn’t have worn casual clothing like the others.\nAdolin was to be in uniform, even on a hunt. The Alethi War Codes\ncommanded it. Never mind that nobody had followed those Codes in\ncenturies. Or at least nobody but Dalinar Kholin—and, by extension, his\nsons.\nAdolin passed a pair of lounging lighteyes, Vartian and Lomard, two of\nSadeas’s recent hangers-on. They were talking loudly enough that Adolin\ncould hear. Probably on purpose. “Chasing after the king again,” Vartian\nsaid, shaking his head. “Like pet axehounds nipping at their master’s heels.”\n“Shameful,” Lomard said. “How long has it been since Dalinar won a\ngemheart? The only time he can get one is when the king lets them hunt it\nwithout competition.”\nAdolin set his jaw and rode on. His father’s interpretation of the Codes\nwouldn’t let Adolin challenge a man to a duel while he was on duty or in\ncommand. He chafed at the needless restrictions, but Dalinar had spoken as\nAdolin’s commanding officer. That meant there was no room for argument.\nHe’d have to find a way to duel the two idiot sycophants in another setting,\nput them in their places. Unfortunately, he couldn’t duel everyone who\nspoke out against his father.\nThe biggest problem was, the things they said had some real truth to\nthem. The Alethi princedoms were like kingdoms unto themselves, still\nmostly autonomous despite having accepted Gavilar as king. Elhokar had\ninherited the throne, and Dalinar, by right, had taken the Kholin Princedom\nas his own."

        "text": "mostly autonomous despite having accepted Gavilar as king. Elhokar had\ninherited the throne, and Dalinar, by right, had taken the Kholin Princedom\nas his own.\nHowever, most of the highprinces gave only token nods to the\nparamount rule of the king. That left Elhokar without land that was\nspecifically his own. He tended to act like a highprince of the Kholin\nPrincedom, taking great interest in its day-to-day management. So, while\nDalinar should have been a ruler unto himself, he instead bent to Elhokar’s\nwhims and dedicated his resources to protecting his nephew. That made him\nweak in the eyes of the others—nothing more than a glorified bodyguard.\nOnce, when Dalinar had been feared, men had not dared whisper about\nthese things. But now? Dalinar went on fewer and fewer plateau assaults,\nand his forces lagged behind in capturing precious gemhearts. While the\nothers fought and won, Dalinar and his sons spent their time in bureaucratic\nadministration.\nAdolin wanted to be out there fighting, killing Parshendi. What was the\ngood of following the Codes of War when he rarely got to go to war? It’s\nthe fault of those delusions. Dalinar wasn’t weak, and he certainly wasn’t a\ncoward, no matter what people said. He was just troubled.\nThe rearguard captains weren’t formed up yet, so Adolin decided to\ngive the king a report instead. He trotted up toward the king—joining\nSadeas, who was doing the same. Not unexpectedly, Sadeas frowned at him.\nThe highprince hated that Adolin had a Blade while Sadeas had none; he\nhad coveted one for years now.\nAdolin met the highprince’s eyes, smiling. Anytime you want to duel\nme for my Blade, Sadeas, go ahead and try. What Adolin wouldn’t do to get\nthat eel of a man in the dueling ring.\nWhen Dalinar and the king rode up, and Adolin spoke quickly, before\nSadeas could speak. “Your Majesty, I have scout reports.”\nThe king sighed. “More of nothing, I expect. Honestly, Uncle, must we\nhave a report on every little detail of the army?”\n“We are at war, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said.\nElhokar sighed sufferingly.\nYou’re a strange man, cousin, Adolin thought. Elhokar saw murderers\nin every shadow, yet often dismissed the Parshendi threat. He’d go charging\noff like he had today, with no honor guard, and would leap off a forty-foot-\ntall rock formation. Yet he’d stay up nights, terrified of assassination.\n“Give your report, son,” Dalinar said.\nAdolin hesitated, now feeling foolish at the lack of substance to what\nhe had to say. “The scouts have seen no sign of the Parshendi. They’ve met\nwith the huntmaster. Two companies have secured the next plateau, and the\nother eight will need some time to cross. We’re close, though.”\n“Yes, we saw from above,” Elhokar said. “Perhaps a few of us could\nride ahead….”\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “The point of bringing my troops along\nwould be somewhat undermined if you left them behind.”"

        "text": "ride ahead….”\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “The point of bringing my troops along\nwould be somewhat undermined if you left them behind.”\nElhokar rolled his eyes. Dalinar did not yield, his expression as\nimmobile as the rocks around them. Seeing him like that—firm, unyielding\nbefore a challenge—made Adolin smile with pride. Why couldn’t he be like\nthis all of the time? Why did he back down so often before insults or\nchallenges?\n“Very well,” the king said. “We’ll take a break and wait while the army\ncrosses.”\nThe king’s attendants responded immediately, men climbing off\nhorses, women having their palanquin bearers set them down. Adolin\nmoved off to get that rearguard report. By the time he returned, Elhokar was\npractically holding court. His servants had set up a small awning to give\nhim shade, and others served wine. Chilled, using one of the new fabrials\nthat could make things cold.\nAdolin removed his helm and wiped his brow with his saddle rag,\nagain wishing he could join the others and enjoy a little wine. Instead, he\nclimbed down from his horse and went looking for his father. Dalinar stood\noutside the awning, gauntleted hands clasped behind his back, looking\neastward, toward the Origin—the distant, the unseen place where\nhighstorms began. Renarin stood at his side, looking out as well, as if trying\nto see what it was that his father found so interesting.\nAdolin rested a hand on his brother’s shoulder, and Renarin smiled at\nhim. Adolin knew that his brother—now nineteen years old—felt out of\nplace. Though he wore a side sword, he barely knew how to use it. His\nblood weakness made it difficult for him to spend any reasonable amount of\ntime practicing.\n“Father,” Adolin said. “Maybe the king was right. Perhaps we should\nhave moved on quickly. I’d rather have this entire hunt over with.”\nDalinar looked at him. “When I was your age, I looked forward to a\nhunt like this. Taking down a greatshell was the highlight of a young man’s\nyear.”\nNot this again, Adolin thought. Why was everyone so offended that he\ndidn’t find hunts exciting? “It’s just an oversized chull, Father.”\n“These ‘oversized chulls’ grow to fifty feet tall and are capable of\ncrushing even a man in Shardplate.”\n“Yes,” Adolin said, “and so we’ll bait it for hours while baking in the\nhot sun. If it decides to show up, we’ll pelt it with arrows, only closing in\nonce it’s so weak it can barely resist as we hack it to death with\nShardblades. Very honorable.”\n“It’s not a duel,” Dalinar said, “it’s a hunt. A grand tradition.”\nAdolin raised an eyebrow at him.\n“And yes,” Dalinar added. “It can be tedious. But the king was\ninsistent.”\n“You’re just still smarting over the problems with Rilla, Adolin,”\nRenarin said. “You were eager a week ago. You really should have invited\nJanala.”\n“Janala hates hunts. Thinks they’re barbarous.”\nDalinar frowned. “Janala? Who’s Janala?”"

Who’s Janala?”\n“Daughter of Brightlord Lustow,” Adolin said.\n“And you’re courting her?”\n“Not yet, but I’ve sure been trying.”\n“What happened to that other girl? The short one, with the fondness\nfor silver hair ribbons?”\n“Deeli?” Adolin said. “Father, I stopped courting her over two months\nback!”\n“You did?”\n“Yes.”\nDalinar rubbed his chin.\n“There have been two between her and Janala, Father,” Adolin noted.\n“You really need to pay more attention.”\n“Almighty help any man who tries to keep track of your tangled\ncourtships, son.”\n“The most recent was Rilla,” Renarin said.\nDalinar frowned. “And you two…”\n“Had some problems yesterday,” Adolin said. He coughed, determined\nto change the subject. “Anyway, don’t you find it odd that the king would\ninsist on coming to hunt the chasmfiend himself?”\n“Not particularly. It isn’t often that a full-sized one makes its way out\nhere, and the king rarely gets to go on plateau runs. This is a way for him to\nfight.”\n“But he’s so paranoid! Why does he now want to go and hunt,\nexposing himself on the Plains?”\nDalinar looked toward the king’s awning. “I know he seems odd, son.\nBut the king is more complex a man than many give him credit for being.\nHe worries that his subjects see him as a coward because of how much he\nfears assassins, and so he finds ways to prove his courage. Foolish ways,\nsometimes—but he’s not the first man I’ve known who will face battle\nwithout fear, yet cower in terror about knives in the shadows. The hallmark\nof insecurity is bravado.\n“The king is learning to lead. He needs this hunt. He needs to prove to\nhimself, and to others, that he’s still strong and worthy to command a\nkingdom at war. That’s why I encouraged him. A successful hunt, under\ncontrolled circumstances, could bolster his reputation and his confidence.”\nAdolin slowly closed his mouth, his father’s words cutting down his\ncomplaints. Strange, how much the king’s actions made sense when\nexplained that way. Adolin looked up at his father. How can the others\nwhisper that he’s a coward? Can’t they see his wisdom?\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, eyes growing distant. “Your nephew is a better\nman than many think him, and a stronger king. At least he could be. I just\nhave to figure out how to persuade him to leave the Shattered Plains.”\nAdolin started. “What?”\n“I didn’t understand at first,” Dalinar continued. “Unite them. I’m\nsupposed to unite them. But aren’t they already united? We fight together\nhere on the Shattered Plains. We have a common enemy in the Parshendi.\nI’m beginning to see that we’re united only in name. The highprinces give\nlip service to Elhokar, but this war—this siege—is a game to them. A\ncompetition against one another."

The others worry too much about winning wealth and\nprestige.”\n“Wealth and prestige are what being Alethi is about, Father!” Adolin\nsaid. Was he really hearing this? “What of the Vengeance Pact? The\nhighprinces vowed to seek retribution upon the Parshendi!”\n“And we have sought it.” Dalinar looked to Adolin. “I realize that it\nsounds terrible, son, but some things are more important than vengeance. I\nloved Gavilar. I miss him fiercely, and I hate the Parshendi for what they\ndid. But Gavilar’s life work was to unite Alethkar, and I’ll go to Damnation\nbefore I let it break apart.”\n“Father,” Adolin said, feeling pained, “if there’s something wrong\nhere, it’s that we’re not trying hard enough. You think the highprinces are\nplaying games? Well, show them the way it should be done! Instead of\ntalking of retreat, we should be talking of advancing, striking at the\nParshendi instead of besieging them.”\n“Perhaps.”\n“Either way, we cannot speak of withdrawing,” Adolin said. The men\nalready talked of Dalinar losing his spine. What would they say if they got\nhold of this? “You haven’t brought this up with the king, have you?”\n“Not yet. I haven’t found the right way.”\n“Please. Don’t talk to him about it.”\n“We shall see.” Dalinar turned back toward the Shattered Plains, his\neyes growing distant again.\n“Father…”\n“You’ve made your point, son, and I’ve replied to it. Do not press the\nissue. Have you gotten the report from the rear guard?”\n“Yes.”\n“What of the vanguard?”\n“I just checked with them and…” He trailed off. Blast. It had been\nlong enough that it was probably time to move the king’s party onward. The\nlast of the army couldn’t leave this plateau until the king was safely on the\nother side.\nAdolin sighed and went off to collect the report. Before long, they\nwere all across the chasm and riding over the next plateau. Renarin trotted\nup to Adolin and tried to engage him in conversation, but Adolin gave only\nhalfhearted replies.\nHe was beginning to feel an odd longing. Most of the older men in the\narmy—even those only a few years older than Adolin—had fought\nalongside his father during the glory days. Adolin found himself jealous of\nall of those men who had known his father and had seen him fight when he\nhadn’t been so wrapped up in the Codes.\nThe changes in Dalinar had begun with the death of his brother. That\nterrible day was when everything had started to go wrong. The loss of\nGavilar had nearly crushed Dalinar, and Adolin would never forgive the\nParshendi for bringing his father such pain. Never. Men fought on the\nPlains for different reasons, but this was why Adolin had come. Perhaps if"

Perhaps if\nthey beat the Parshendi, his father would go back to the man he had been.\nPerhaps those ghostly delusions that haunted him would vanish.\nAhead, Dalinar was speaking quietly with Sadeas. Both men wore\nfrowns. They barely tolerated one another, though they had once been\nfriends. That had also changed the night of Gavilar’s death. What had\nhappened between them?\nThe day wore on, and they eventually arrived at the hunt site—a pair\nof plateaus, one where the creature would be lured up to attack, and another\none a safe distance away for those who would watch. Like most others,\nthese plateaus had an uneven surface inhabited by hardy plants adapted\nto regular storm exposure. Rocky shelves, depressions, and uneven footing\nmade fighting on them treacherous.\nAdolin joined his father, who waited beside the final bridge as the king\nmoved over onto the viewing plateau, followed by a company of soldiers.\nThe attendants would be next.\n“You’re doing well with your command, son,” Dalinar said, nodding to\na group of soldiers at they passed and saluted.\n“They’re good men, Father. They hardly need someone to command\nthem during a march from plateau to plateau.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “But you need experience leading, and they need\nto learn to see you as a commander.” Renarin trotted up to them on his\nhorse; it was probably time to cross to the viewing plateau. Dalinar nodded\nfor his sons to go first.\nAdolin turned to go, but hesitated as he noticed something on the\nplateau behind them. A rider, moving quickly to catch up with the hunting\nparty, coming from the direction of the warcamps.\n“Father,” Adolin said, pointing.\nDalinar turned immediately, following the gesture. However, Adolin\nsoon recognized the newcomer. Not a messenger, as he’d expected.\n“Wit!” Adolin called, waving.\nThe newcomer trotted up to them. Tall and thin, the King’s Wit rode\neasily on a black gelding. He wore a stiff black coat and black trousers, a\ncolor matched by his deep onyx hair. Though he wore a long, thin sword\ntied to his waist, as far as Adolin knew, the man had never drawn it.

He had blue eyes, but he wasn’t really a lighteyes. Nor was he\na darkeyes. He was…well, he was the King’s Wit. That was a category all\nits own.\n“Ah, young Prince Adolin!” Wit exclaimed. “You actually managed to\npry yourself away from the camp’s young women long enough to join this\nhunt?

Wit would find out eventually anyway—it was virtually\nimpossible to keep anything from the man. “I made a lunch appointment\nwith one woman yesterday, but I was…well, I was courting another. And\nshe’s the jealous type. So now neither will speak with me.”\n“It’s a constant source of amazement that you get yourself into such\nmesses, Adolin. Each one is more exciting than the previous!”\n“Er, yes. Exciting. That’s exactly how it feels.”\nWit laughed again, though he maintained a sense of dignity in his\nposture. The King’s Wit was not a silly court fool such as one might find in\nother kingdoms. He was a sword, a tool maintained by the king. Insulting\nothers was beneath the dignity of the king, so just as one used gloves when\nforced to handle something vile, the king retained a Wit so he didn’t have to\ndebase himself to the level of rudeness or offensiveness.\nThis new Wit had been with them for some months, and there was\nsomething…different about him. He seemed to know things that he\nshouldn’t, important things. Useful things.\nWit nodded to Dalinar. “Your Lordship.”\n“Wit,” Dalinar said stiffly.\n“And young Prince Renarin!”\nRenarin kept his eyes down.\n“No greeting for me, Renarin?” Wit said, amused.\nRenarin said nothing.\n“He thinks you’ll mock him if he speaks to you, Wit,” Adolin said.\n“Earlier this morning, he told me he’d determined not to say anything\naround you.”\n“Wonderful!” Wit exclaimed. “Then I can say whatever I wish, and\nhe’ll not object?”\nRenarin hesitated.\nWit leaned in to Adolin. “Have I told you about the night Prince\nRenarin and I had two days back, walking the streets of the warcamp? We\ncame across these two sisters, you see, blue eyed and—”\n“That’s a lie!” Renarin said, blushing.\n“Very well,” Wit said without missing a beat, “I’ll confess there were\nactually three sisters, but Prince Renarin quite unfairly ended up with two\nof them, and I didn’t wish to diminish my reputation by—”\n“Wit.” Dalinar was stern as he cut in.\nThe black-clad man looked to him.\n“Perhaps you should restrict your mockery to those who deserve it.”\n“Brightlord Dalinar. I believe that was what I was doing.”\nDalinar’s frown deepened. He never had liked Wit, and picking on\nRenarin was a sure way to raise his ire. Adolin could understand that, but\nWit was almost always good-natured with Renarin.\nWit moved to leave, passing Dalinar as he did. Adolin could barely\noverhear what was said as Wit leaned over to whisper something. “Those\nwho ‘deserve’ my mockery are those who can benefit from it, Brightlord\nDalinar. That one is less fragile than you think him.” He winked, then\nturned his horse to move on over the bridge.\n“Stormwinds, but I like that man,” Adolin said. “Best Wit we’ve had in\nages!”\n“I find him unnerving,” Renarin said softly.\n“That’s half the fun!”\nDalinar said nothing.

The three of them crossed the bridge, passing\nWit, who had stopped to torment a group of officers—lighteyes of low\nenough rank that they needed to serve in the army and earn a wage. Several\nof them laughed while Wit poked fun at another.\nThe three of them joined the king, and were immediately approached\nby the day’s huntmaster. Bashin was a short man with a sizable paunch; he\nwore rugged clothing with a leather overcoat and a wide-brimmed hat. He\nwas a darkeyes of the first nahn, the highest and most prestigious rank a\ndarkeyes could have, worthy even of marrying into a lighteyed family.\nBashin bowed to the king. “Your Majesty! Wonderful timing! We’ve\njust tossed down the bait.”\n“Excellent,” Elhokar said, climbing from the saddle. Adolin and\nDalinar did likewise, Shardplate clinking softly, Dalinar untying his helm\nfrom the saddle. “How long will it take?”\n“Two or three hours is likely,” Bashin said, taking the reins of the\nking’s horse. Grooms took the two Ryshadium. “We’ve set up over there.”\nBashin pointed toward the hunting plateau, the smaller plateau where\nthe actual fighting would take place away from the attendants and the bulk\nof the soldiers. A group of hunters led a lumbering chull around its\nperimeter, towing a rope draped over the side of the cliff. That rope would\nbe dragging the bait.\n“We’re using hog carcasses,” Bashin explained. “And we poured hog’s\nblood over the sides. The chasmfiend has been spotted by patrols here a\ngood dozen times. He’s got his nest nearby, for certain—he’s not here to\npupate. He’s too big for that, and he’s remained in the area too long. So it\nshould be a fine hunt! Once he arrives, we’ll loose a group of wild hogs as\ndistractions, and you can begin weakening him with arrows.”\nThey had brought grandbows: large steel bows with thick strings and\nsuch a high draw weight that only a Shardbearer could use them, to fire\nshafts as thick as three fingers. They were recent creations, devised by\nAlethi engineers through the use of fabrial science, and each required a\nsmall infused gemstone to maintain the strength of its pull without warping\nthe metal. Adolin’s aunt Navani—the widow of King Gavilar, mother of\nElhokar and his sister Jasnah—had led the research to develop the bows.\nIt would be nice if she hadn’t left, Adolin thought idly. Navani was an\ninteresting woman. Things were never boring around her.\nSome had started calling the bows Shardbows, but Adolin didn’t like\nthe term. Shardblades and Shardplate were something special. Relics from\nanother time, a time when the Radiants had walked Roshar. No amount of\nfabrial science had even approached re-creating them.\nBashin led the king and his highprinces toward a pavilion at the center\nof the viewing plateau. Adolin joined his father, intending to give a report\non the crossing. About half of the soldiers were in place, but many of the"

About half of the soldiers were in place, but many of the\nattendants were still making their way across the large, permanent bridge\nonto the viewing plateau. The king’s banner flapped above the pavilion, and\na small refreshment station had been erected. A soldier at the back was\nsetting up the rack of four grandbows. They were sleek and dangerous-\nlooking, with thick black shafts in four quivers beside them.\n“I think you’ll have a fine day for the hunt,” Bashin said to Dalinar.\n“Judging by reports, the beast is a big one. Larger than you’ve ever slain\nbefore, Brightlord.”\n“Gavilar always wanted to slay one of these,” Dalinar said wistfully.\n“He loved greatshell hunts, though he never got a chasmfiend. Odd that I’ve\nnow killed so many.”\nThe chull pulling the bait bleated in the distance.\n“You need to go for the legs on this one, Brightlords,” Bashin said.\nPre-hunt advice was one of Bashin’s responsibilities, and he took those\nseriously. “Chasmfiends, well, you’re used to attacking them in their\nchrysalises. Don’t forget how mean they are when they’re not pupating.\nWith one this big, use a distraction and come in from…” He trailed off, then\ngroaned, cursing softly. “Storms take that animal. I swear, the man who\ntrained it must have been daft.”\nHe was looking across at the next plateau. Adolin followed his glance.\nThe crablike chull that had been towing the bait was lumbering away from\nthe chasm with a slow, yet determined gait. Its handlers were yelling,\nrunning after it.\n“I’m sorry, Brightlord,” Bashin said. “It’s been doing this all day.”\nThe chull bleated in a gravelly voice. Something seemed wrong to\nAdolin.\n“We can send for another one,” Elhokar said. “It shouldn’t take too\nlong to—”\n“Bashin?” Dalinar said, his voice suddenly alarmed. “Shouldn’t there\nbe bait on the end of that beast’s rope?”\nThe huntmaster froze. The rope the chull was towing was frayed at the\nend.\nSomething dark—something mind-numbingly enormous—rose out of\nthe chasm on thick, chitinous legs. It climbed onto the plateau—not the\nsmall plateau where the hunt was supposed to take place, but the viewing\nplateau where Dalinar and Adolin stood. The plateau filled with attendants,\nunarmed guests, female scribes, and unprepared soldiers.\n“Aw, Damnation,” Bashin said.\nI realize that you are probably still angry. That is pleasant to know.\nMuch as your perpetual health, I have come to rely upon your\ndissatisfaction with me. It is one of the cosmere’s great constants, I\nshould think.\nTen heartbeats.\nOne.\nThat was how long it took to summon a Shardblade. If Dalinar’s heart\nwas racing, the time was shorter. If he was relaxed, it took longer.\nTwo.\nOn the battlefield, the passing of those beats could stretch like an\neternity. He pulled his helm on as he ran.\nThree."

He pulled his helm on as he ran.\nThree.\nThe chasmfiend slammed an arm down, smashing the bridge filled\nwith attendants and soldiers. People screamed, plunging into the chasm.\nDalinar dashed forward on Plate-enhanced legs, following the king.\nFour.\nThe chasmfiend towered like a mountain of interlocking carapace the\ncolor of dark violet ink. Dalinar could see why the Parshendi called these\nthings gods. It had a twisted, arrowhead-like face, with a mouth full of\nbarbed mandibles. While it was vaguely crustacean, this was no bulky,\nplacid chull. It had four wicked foreclaws set into broad shoulders, each\nclaw the size of a horse, and a dozen smaller legs that clutched the side of\nthe plateau.\nFive.\nChitin made a grinding noise against stone as the creature finished\npulling itself onto the plateau, snatching a cart-pulling chull with a swift\nclaw.\nSix.\n“To arms, to arms!” Elhokar bellowed ahead of Dalinar. “Archers,\nfire!”\nSeven.\n“Distract it from the unarmed!” Dalinar bellowed at his soldiers.\nThe creature cracked the chull’s shell—platter-size fragments\nclattering to the plateau—then stuffed the beast into its maw and began\nlooking down at the fleeing scribes and attendants. The chull stopped\nbleating as the monster crunched down.\nEight.\nDalinar leaped a rocky shelf and sailed five yards before slamming into\nthe ground, throwing up chips of rock.\nNine.\nThe chasmfiend bellowed with an awful screeching sound. It\ntrumpeted with four voices, overlapping one another.\nArchers drew. Elhokar yelled orders just in front of Dalinar, his blue\ncape flapping.\nDalinar’s hand tingled with anticipation.\nTen!\nHis Shardblade—Oathbringer—formed in his hand, coalescing from\nmist, appearing as the tenth beat of his heart thudded in his chest. Six feet\nlong from tip to hilt, the Blade would have been unwieldy in the hands of\nany man not wearing Shardplate. To Dalinar, it felt perfect. He’d carried\nOathbringer since his youth, Bonding to it when he was twenty Weepings\nold. It was long and slightly curved, a handspan wide, with wavelike\nserrations near the hilt. It curved at the tip like a fisherman’s hook, and was\nwet with cold dew.\nThis sword was a part of him. He could sense energy racing along its\nblade, as if it were eager. A man never really knew life itself until he\ncharged into battle with Plate and Blade.\n“Make it angry!” Elhokar bellowed, his Shardblade—Sunraiser—\nspringing from mist into his hand. It was long and thin with a large\ncrossguard, and was etched up the sides with the ten fundamental glyphs.\nHe didn’t want the monster to escape; Dalinar could hear it in his voice.\nDalinar was more worried about the soldiers and attendants; this hunt had\nalready turned terribly wrong.

Perhaps they should distract the monster long\nenough for everyone to escape, then pull back and let it dine on chulls and\nhogs.\nThe creature screamed its multivoiced wail again, slamming a claw\ndown among the soldiers. Men screamed; bones splintered and bodies\ncrumpled.\nArchers loosed, aiming for the head. A hundred shafts zipped into the\nair, but only a few hit the soft muscle between plates of chitin. Behind\nthem, Sadeas was calling for his grandbow. Dalinar couldn’t wait for that—\nthe creature was here, dangerous, killing his men. The bow would be too\nslow. This was a job for the Blade.\nAdolin charged past, riding Sureblood. The lad had gone racing for his\nhorse, rather than charging like Elhokar had. Dalinar himself had been\nforced to stay with the king. The other horses—even the warhorses—\npanicked, but Adolin’s white Ryshadium stallion held steady. In a moment,\nGallant was there, trotting beside Dalinar. Dalinar grabbed the reins and\nheaved himself into the air with Plate-enhanced legs, jumping up into the\nsaddle. The force of his landing might have strained the back of a regular\nhorse, but Gallant was made of stronger stone than that.\nElhokar closed his helm, the sides misting.\n“Hold back, Your Majesty,” Dalinar called, riding past. “Wait until\nAdolin and I weaken it.” Dalinar reached up, slamming down his own visor.\nThe sides misted, locking it into place, and the sides of the helm became\ntranslucent to him. You still needed the eye slit—looking through the sides\nwas like looking through dirty glass—but the translucence was one of the\nmost wonderful parts of Shardplate.\nDalinar rode into the monster’s shadow. Soldiers scrambled about,\nclutching spears. They hadn’t been trained to fight thirty-foot-tall beasts,\nand it was a testament to their valor that they formed up anyway, trying to\ndraw attention away from the archers and the fleeing attendants.\nArrows rained down, bouncing off the carapace and becoming more\ndeadly to the troops below than they were to the chasmfiend. Dalinar raised\nhis free arm to shade his eye slit as an arrow clanged off his helm.\nAdolin fell back as the beast swung at a batch of archers, crushing\nthem with one of its claws. “I’ll take left,” Adolin yelled, voice muffled by\nhis helm.\nDalinar nodded, cutting to the right, galloping past a group of dazed\nsoldiers and into sunlight again as the chasmfiend raised a foreclaw for\nanother sweep. Dalinar raced under the limb, transferring Oathbringer to his\nleft hand and holding the sword out to the side, slashing it through one of\nthe chasmfiend’s trunklike legs.\nThe Blade sheared the thick chitin with barely a tug of resistance. As\nalways, it didn’t cut living flesh, though it killed the leg as surely as if it had\nbeen cut free. The large limb slipped, falling numb and useless."

The large limb slipped, falling numb and useless.\nThe monster roared with its deep, overlapping, trumpeting voices. On\nthe other side, Dalinar could make out Adolin slicing at a leg.\nThe creature shook, turning toward Dalinar. The two legs that had been\ncut dragged lifelessly. The monster was long and narrow like a cray-fish,\nand had a flattened tail. It walked on fourteen legs. How many could it lose\nbefore collapsing?\nDalinar rounded Gallant, meeting up with Adolin, whose blue\nShardplate was gleaming, cape streaming behind him. They switched sides\nas they turned in wide arcs, each heading for another leg.\n“Meet your enemy, monster!” Elhokar bellowed.\nDalinar turned. The king had found his mount and had managed to get\nit under control. Vengeance wasn’t a Ryshadium, but the animal was of the\nbest Shin stock. Astride the animal, Elhokar charged, Blade held above his\nhead.\nWell, there was no forbidding him the fight. He should be all right in\nhis Plate so long as he kept moving. “The legs, Elhokar!” Dalinar shouted.\nElhokar ignored him, charging directly for the beast’s chest. Dalinar\ncursed, heeling Gallant as the monster swung. Elhokar turned at the last\nmoment, leaning low, ducking under the blow. The chasmfiend’s claw hit\nstone with a cracking sound. It roared in anger at missing Elhokar, the\nsound echoing through the chasms.\nThe king veered toward Dalinar, riding past him in a rush. “I’m\ndistracting it, you fool. Keep attacking!”\n“I have the Ryshadium!” Dalinar yelled back at him. “I’ll distract—\nI’m faster!”\nElhokar ignored him again. Dalinar sighed. Elhokar, characteristically,\ncould not be contained. Arguing would only cost more time and more lives,\nso Dalinar did as he’d been told. He rounded to the side for another\napproach, Gallant’s hooves beating against the stone ground. The king drew\nthe monster’s direct attention, and Dalinar was able to ride in and slam his\nBlade through another leg.\nThe beast emitted four overlapping screams and turned toward Dalinar.\nBut as it did, Adolin rode past on the other side, cutting at another leg with\na deft strike. The leg slumped, and arrows rained down as archers continued\nto fire.\nThe creature shook, confused by the attacks coming from every side. It\nwas getting weak, and Dalinar raised his arm, gesturing. The command\nordered the rest of the foot soldiers to retreat toward the pavilion. Orders\ngiven, he slipped in and killed another leg. That meant five down. Perhaps it\nwas time to let the beast limp away; killing it now wasn’t worth risking\nlives.\nHe called to the king, who rode—Blade held out to the side—a short\ndistance away. The king glanced at him, but obviously didn’t hear. As the\nchasmfiend loomed in the background, Elhokar wheeled Vengeance in a\nsharp right turn toward Dalinar."

As the\nchasmfiend loomed in the background, Elhokar wheeled Vengeance in a\nsharp right turn toward Dalinar.\nThere was a soft snap, and suddenly the king—and his saddle—went\ntumbling through the air. The horse’s quick turn had caused the saddle girth\nto break. A man in Shardplate was heavy and put a great strain on both his\nmount and saddle.\nDalinar felt a spike of fear, and he reined in Gallant. Elhokar slammed\nto the ground, dropping his Shardblade. The weapon reverted to mist,\nvanishing. It was a protection from keeping a Blade from being taken by\nyour enemies; they vanished unless you willed them to stay when releasing\nthem.\n“Elhokar!” Dalinar bellowed. The king rolled, cape wrapping around\nhis body, then came to rest. He lay dazed for a moment; the armor was\ncracked on one shoulder, leaking Stormlight. The Plate would have\ncushioned the fall. He’d be all right.\nUnless—\nA claw loomed above the king.\nDalinar felt a moment of panic, turning Gallant to charge toward the\nking. He was going to be too slow! The beast would—\nAn enormous arrow slammed into the chasmfiend’s head, cracking\nchitin. Purple gore spurted free, causing the beast to trump in agony.\nDalinar twisted in the saddle.\nSadeas stood in his red Plate, taking another massive arrow from an\nattendant. He drew, launching the thick bolt into the chasmfiend’s shoulder\nwith a sharp crack.\nDalinar raised Oathbringer in salute. Sadeas acknowledged, raising his\nbow. They were not friends, and they did not like one another.\nBut they would protect the king. That was the bond that united them.\n“Get to safety!” Dalinar yelled to the king as he charged past. Elhokar\nstumbled to his feet and nodded.\nDalinar moved in. He had to distract the beast long enough for Elhokar\nto get away. More of Sadeas’s arrows flew true, but the monster started to\nignore them. Its sluggishness vanished, and its bleats became angry, wild,\ncrazed. It was growing truly enraged.\nThis was the most dangerous part; there would be no retreating now. It\nwould follow them until it either killed them or was slain.\nA claw smashed to the ground just beside Gallant, throwing chips of\nstone into the air. Dalinar hunkered low, careful to keep his Shardblade out,\nand he cut free another leg. Adolin had done the same on the other side.\nSeven legs down, half of them. How long before the beast dropped?\nNormally, at this stage, they had launched several dozen arrows into the\nanimal. It was difficult to guess what one would do without that prior\nsoftening—beside that, he’d never fought one this large before.\nHe turned Gallant, trying to draw the creature’s attention. Hopefully,\nElhokar had—\n“Are you a god!” Elhokar bellowed.\nDalinar groaned, looking over his shoulder. The king had not fled. He\nstrode toward the beast, hand to the side."

I defy\nyou!”\nDamnation’s own fool! Dalinar thought, rounding Gallant.\nElhokar’s Shardblade reformed in his hands, and he charged toward\nthe monster’s chest, his cracked shoulder leaking Stormlight. He got close\nand swung at the beast’s torso, cutting free a piece of chitin—like a person’s\nhair or nails, it could be cut by a Blade. Then Elhokar slammed his weapon\ninto the monster’s breast, seeking its heart.\nThe beast roared and shook, knocking Elhokar free. The king barely\nkept hold of his Blade. The beast spun. That movement, unfortunately,\nbrought its tail at Dalinar. He cursed, yanking Gallant in a tight turn, but the\ntail came too quickly. It slammed into Gallant, and in a heartbeat Dalinar\nfound himself rolling, Oathbringer tumbling from his fingers and slicing a\ngash in the stone ground before puffing to mist.\n“Father!” a distant voice yelled.\nDalinar came to rest on the stones, dizzy. He raised his head to see\nGallant stumbling to his feet. Blessedly, the horse hadn’t broken a leg,\nthough the animal bled from scrapes and was favoring one leg.\n“Away!” Dalinar said. The command word would send the horse to\nsafety. Unlike Elhokar, it would obey.\nDalinar climbed to his feet, unsteady. A scraping sound came from his\nleft, and Dalinar spun just in time for the chasmfiend’s tail to take him in\nthe chest, tossing him backward.\nAgain the world lurched, and metal hit stone in a cacophony as he slid.\nNo! he thought, getting a gauntleted hand beneath himself and\nheaving, using the momentum of his slide to throw himself upright. As the\nsky spun, something seemed to right, as if the Plate itself knew which way\nwas up. He landed—still moving, feet grinding on stone.\nHe got his balance, then charged toward the king, beginning the\nprocess of summoning his Shardblade again. Ten heartbeats. An eternity.\nThe archers continued to fire, and more than a few of their shafts\nbristled form the chasmfiend’s face. It ignored them, though Sadeas’s larger\narrows still seemed to distract it. Adolin had sheared through another leg,\nand the creature lumbered uncertainly, eight of its fourteen legs dragging\nuselessly.\n“Father!”\nDalinar turned to see Renarin—dressed in a stiff blue Kholin uniform,\nwith a long coat buttoning to the neck—riding across the rocky ground.\n“Father, are you well? Can I help?”\n“Fool boy!” Dalinar said, pointing. “Go!”\n“But—”\n“You’re unarmored and unarmed!” Dalinar bellowed. “Get back before\nyou get yourself killed!”\nRenarin pulled his roan horse to a halt.\n“GO!”"

If he rammed the Shardblade in just right, he\ncould stop the heart or lungs, but that would be difficult while the beast was\nupright.\nAdolin—stalwart as always—had dismounted beside the king.

Two swung at him at once, and though\nAdolin sliced a chunk out of one, he didn’t see the other sweeping at his\nback.\nDalinar called out too late.

Adolin thought, watching his father stand over the king,\nbowed beneath the enormous weight of a monster many times his size.\nShocked archers hesitated. Sadeas lowered his grandbow. Adolin’s breath\ncaught in his chest.\nDalinar held back the claw and matched its strength, a figure in dark,\nsilvery metal that almost seemed to glow. The beast trumpeted above, and\nDalinar bellowed back a powerful, defiant yell.\nIn that moment, Adolin knew he was seeing him. The Blackthorn, the\nvery man he’d been wishing he could fight alongside. The Plate of Dalinar’s\ngauntlets and shoulders began to crack, webs of light moving down the\nancient metal. Adolin finally shook himself into motion. I have to help!\nHis Shardblade formed in his hand and he scrambled to the side and\nsheared through the leg nearest to him. There was a crack in the air. With so\nmany legs down, the beast’s other legs couldn’t hold its weight, particularly\nwhen it was trying so hard to crush Dalinar. The remaining legs on its right\nside snapped with a sickening crunch, spraying out violet ichor, and the\nbeast toppled to the side.\nThe ground shook, nearly knocking Adolin to his knees. Dalinar tossed\naside the now-limp claw, Stormlight from the many cracks steaming above\nhim. Nearby, the king picked himself up off the ground—it had been mere\nseconds since he’d fallen.\nElhokar stumbled to his feet, looking at the fallen beast. Then he\nturned to his uncle, the Blackthorn.\nDalinar nodded thankfully to Adolin, then gestured sharply toward\nwhat passed for the beast’s neck. Elhokar nodded, then summoned his\nBlade and rammed it deeply into the monster’s flesh. The creature’s uniform\ngreen eyes blackened and shriveled, smoke twisting into the air.\nAdolin walked up to join his father, watching as Elhokar plunged his\nBlade into the chasmfiend’s chest. Now that the beast was dead, the Blade\ncould cut its flesh. Violet ichor spurted out, and Elhokar dropped his blade\nand reached into the wound, questing with Plate-enhanced arms, grabbing\nsomething."

Violet ichor spurted out, and Elhokar dropped his blade\nand reached into the wound, questing with Plate-enhanced arms, grabbing\nsomething.\nHe ripped free the beast’s gemheart—the enormous gemstone that\ngrew within all chasmfiends. It was lumpy and uncut, but it was a pure\nemerald and as big as a man’s head. It was the largest gemheart Adolin had\never seen, and even the small ones were worth a fortune.\nElhokar held aloft the grisly prize, golden gloryspren appearing around\nhim, and the soldiers yelled in triumph.\nLet me first assure you that the element is quite safe. I have found a\ngood home for it. I protect its safety like I protect my own skin, you\nmight say.\nThe morning after his decision in the highstorm, Kaladin made certain to\narise before the others. He threw off his blanket and strode through the\nroom full of blanketed lumps. He didn’t feel excited, but he did feel\nresolute. Determined to fight again.\nHe began that fight by throwing the door open to the sunlight. Groans\nand curses sounded behind him as the groggy bridgemen awoke. Kaladin\nturned toward them, hands on hips. Bridge Four currently had thirty-four\nmembers. That number fluctuated, but at least twenty-five were needed to\ncarry the bridge. Anything below that, and the bridge would topple for\ncertain. Sometimes, it did even with more members.\n“Up and organize!” Kaladin shouted in his best squadleader’s voice.\nHe shocked himself with the authority in it.\nThe men blinked bleary eyes.\n“That means,” Kaladin bellowed, “out of the barrack and form ranks!\nYou’ll do it now, storm you, or I’ll haul you out one by one myself!”\nSyl fluttered down and landed on his shoulder, watching curiously.\nSome of the bridgemen sat up, staring at him, baffled. Others turned over in\ntheir blankets, putting their backs to him.\nKaladin took a deep breath. “So be it.” He strode into the room and\nchose a lean Alethi named Moash. He was a strong man; Kaladin needed an\nexample, and one of the skinnier men like Dunny or Narm wouldn’t do.\nPlus, Moash was one of those who’d turned over to go back to sleep.\nKaladin grabbed Moash by one arm and heaved, pulling with all his\nstrength. Moash stumbled to his feet. He was a younger man, perhaps near\nKaladin’s age, and had a hawkish face.\n“Storm off!” Moash snapped, pulling his arm back.\nKaladin punched Moash right in the gut, where he knew it would wind\nhim. Moash gasped in shock, doubling over, and Kaladin stepped forward\nto grab him by the legs, slinging Moash over his shoulder.\nKaladin almost toppled from the weight. Luckily, carrying bridges was\nharsh but effective strength training. Of course, few bridgemen survived\nlong enough to benefit from it. It didn’t help that there were unpredictable\nlulls between runs. That was part of the problem; the bridge crews spent\nmost of their time staring at their feet or doing menial chores, then were\nexpected to run for miles carrying a bridge."

That was part of the problem; the bridge crews spent\nmost of their time staring at their feet or doing menial chores, then were\nexpected to run for miles carrying a bridge.\nHe carted the shocked Moash outside and set him down on the stone.\nThe rest of the camp was awake, woodworkers arriving at the lumberyard,\nsoldiers jogging to their breakfast or training. The other bridge crews, of\ncourse, were still asleep. They were often allowed to sleep late, unless they\nwere on morning bridge duty.\nKaladin left Moash and walked back into the low-ceilinged barrack.\n“I’ll do the same to each of you, if I have to.”\nHe didn’t have to. The shocked bridgemen filed out into the light,\nblinking. Most stood bare-backed to the sunlight, wearing only knee-length\ntrousers. Moash climbed to his feet, rubbing his stomach and glaring at\nKaladin.\n“Things are going to change in Bridge Four,” Kaladin said. “For one\nthing, there will be no more sleeping in.”\n“And what are we going to do instead?” Sigzil demanded. He had dark\nbrown skin and black hair—that meant he was Makabaki, from\nsouthwestern Roshar. He was the only bridgeman without a beard, and\njudging by his smooth accent, he was probably Azish or Emuli. Foreigners\nwere common in bridge crews—those who didn’t fit in often made their\nway to the crem of an army.\n“Excellent question,” Kaladin said. “We are going to train. Each\nmorning before our daily chores, we will run the bridge in practice to build\nup our endurance.”\nMore than one of the men’s expressions grew dark at this.\n“I know what you are thinking,” Kaladin said. “Aren’t our lives hard\nenough? Shouldn’t we be able to relax during the brief times we have for\nit?”\n“Yeah,” said Leyten, a tall, stout man with curly hair. “That’s right.”\n“No,” Kaladin snapped. “Bridge runs exhaust us because we spend\nmost of our days lounging. Oh, I know we have chores—foraging in the\nchasms, cleaning latrines, scrubbing floors. But the soldiers don’t expect us\nto work hard; they just want us busy. The work helps them ignore us.\n“As your bridgeleader, my primary duty is to keep you alive. There’s\nnot much I can do about the Parshendi arrows, so I have to do something\nabout you. I have to make you stronger, so that when you charge that last\nleg of a bridge run—arrows flying—you can run quickly.” He met the eyes\nof the men in the line, one at a time. “I intend to see that Bridge Four never\nloses another man.”\nThe men stared at him incredulously. Finally, a hefty, thick-limbed\nman at the back bellowed out a laugh. He had tan skin, deep red hair, and\nwas nearly seven feet tall, with large arms and a powerful torso. The\nUnkalaki—simply called Horneaters by most—were a group of people from\nthe middle of Roshar, near Jah Keved. He’d given his name as “Rock” the\nprevious night.\n“Crazy!” said the Horneater. “Is crazy man who now thinks to lead"

The others joined him, shaking their\nheads at Kaladin’s speech. A few laughterspren—minnowlike silver spirits\nthat darted through the air in circular patterns—began to zip about them.\n“Hey Gaz,” Moash called, cupping his hand around his mouth.\nThe short, one-eyed sergeant was chatting with some soldiers nearby.\n“What?” Gaz yelled back with a scowl.\n“This one wants us to carry bridges about as practice,” Moash called\nback. “Do we have to do what he says?”\n“Bah,” Gaz said, waving a hand. “Bridgeleaders only have authority in\nthe field.”\nMoash glanced back at Kaladin. “Looks like you can storm off, friend.\nUnless you’re going to beat us all into submission.”\nThey broke apart, some men wandering back into the barrack, some\nwalking toward the mess halls. Kaladin was left standing alone on the\nstones.\n“That didn’t go so well,” Syl said from his shoulder.\n“No. It didn’t.”\n“You look surprised.”\n“No, just frustrated.” He glared at Gaz. The bridge sergeant turned\naway from him pointedly. “In Amaram’s army, I was given men who were\ninexperienced, but never ones who were blatantly insubordinate.”\n“What’s the difference?” Syl asked. Such an innocent question. The\nanswer should have been obvious, but she cocked her head in confusion.\n“The men in Amaram’s army knew they had worse places they could\ngo. You could punish them. These bridgemen know they’ve reached the\nbottom.” With a sigh, he let some of his tension bleed away. “I’m lucky I\ngot them out of the barrack.”\n“So what do you do now?”\n“I don’t know.” Kaladin glanced to the side, where Gaz still stood\nchatting with the soldiers. “Actually, yes I do.”\nGaz caught sight of Kaladin approaching and displayed a look of\nurgent, wide-eyed horror. He broke off his conversation and hastily rushed\naround the side of a stack of logs.\n“Syl,” Kaladin said, “could you follow him for me?”\nShe smiled, then became a faint line of white, shooting through the air\nand leaving a trail that vanished slowly. Kaladin stopped where Gaz had\nbeen standing.\nSyl zipped back a short time later and reassumed her girlish form.\n“He’s hiding between those two barracks.” She pointed. “He’s crouched\nthere, watching to see if you follow.”\nWith a smile, Kaladin took the long way around the barracks. In the\nalleyway, he found a figure crouching in the shadows, watching in the other\ndirection. Kaladin crept forward, then grabbed Gaz’s shoulder. Gaz let out a\nyelp, spinning, swinging. Kaladin caught the fist easily.\nGaz looked up at Kaladin with horror. “I wasn’t going to lie! Storm\nyou, you don’t have authority anywhere other than on the field. If you hurt\nme again, I’ll have you—”\n“Calm yourself, Gaz,” Kaladin said, releasing the man. “I’m not going"

Not yet, at least.”\nThe shorter man backed away, rubbing his shoulder and glaring at\nKaladin.\n“Today’s third pass,” Kaladin said. “Payday.”\n“You get your pay in an hour like everyone else.”\n“No. You have it now; I saw you talking to the courier there.” He held\nout his hand.\nGaz grumbled, but pulled out a pouch and counted spheres. Tiny,\ntentative white lights shone at their centers. Diamond marks, each worth\nfive diamond chips. A single chip would buy a loaf of bread.\nGaz counted out four marks, though there were five days to a week. He\nhanded them to Kaladin, but Kaladin left his hand open, palm forward.\n“The other one, Gaz.”\n“You said—”\n“Now.”\nGaz jumped, then pulled out a sphere. “You have a strange way of\nkeeping your word, lordling. You promised me…”\nHe trailed off as Kaladin took the sphere he’d just been given and\nhanded it back.\nGaz frowned.\n“Don’t forget where this comes from, Gaz. I’ll keep to my word, but\nyou aren’t keeping part of my pay. I’m giving it to you. Understand?”\nGaz looked confused, though he did snatch the sphere from Kaladin’s\nhand.\n“The money stops coming if something happens to me,” Kaladin said,\ntucking the other four spheres into his pocket. Then he stepped forward.\nKaladin was a tall man, and he loomed over the much shorter Gaz.\n“Remember our bargain. Stay out of my way.”\nGaz refused to be intimidated. He spat to the side, the dark spittle\nclinging to the rock wall, oozing slowly. “I ain’t going to lie for you. If you\nthink one cremstained mark a week will—”\n“I expect only what I said. What is Bridge Four’s camp duty today?”\n“Evening meal. Scrubbing and cleaning.”\n“And bridge duty?”\n“Afternoon shift.”\nThat meant the morning would be open. The crew would like that; they\ncould spend payday losing their spheres on gambling or whores, perhaps\nforgetting for a short time the miserable lives they lived. They’d have to be\nback for afternoon duty, waiting in the lumberyard in case there was a\nbridge run. After evening meal, they’d go scrub pots.\nAnother wasted day. Kaladin turned to walk back to the lumberyard.\n“You aren’t going to change anything,” Gaz called after him. “Those\nmen are bridgemen for a reason.”\nKaladin kept walking, Syl zipping down from the roof to land on his\nshoulder.\n“You don’t have authority,” Gaz called. “You’re not some squadleader\non the field. You’re a storming bridgeman. You hear me? You can’t have\nauthority without a rank!”\nKaladin left the alleyway behind. “He’s wrong.”\nSyl walked around to hang in front of his face, hovering there while he\nmoved.

She cocked her head at him.\n“Authority doesn’t come from a rank,” Kaladin said, fingering the\nspheres in his pocket.\n“Where does it come from?”\n“From the men who give it to you. That’s the only way to get it.” He\nlooked back the way he’d come. Gaz hadn’t left the alleyway yet. “Syl, you\ndon’t sleep, do you?”\n“Sleep? A spren?” She seemed amused by the concept.\n“Would you watch over me at night?” he said. “Make sure Gaz doesn’t\nsneak in and try something while I’m sleeping? He may try to have me\nkilled.”\n“You think he’d actually do that?”\nKaladin thought for a moment. “No. No, probably not. I’ve known a\ndozen men like him—petty bullies with just enough power to be annoying.\nGaz is a thug, but I don’t think he’s a murderer. Besides, in his opinion, he\ndoesn’t have to hurt me; he just has to wait until I get killed on a bridge run.\nStill, best to be safe. Watch over me, if you would. Wake me if he tries\nsomething.”\n“Sure. But what if he just goes to more important men? Tells them to\nexecute you?”\nKaladin grimaced. “Then there’s nothing I can do. But I don’t think\nhe’d do that. It would make him look weak before his superiors.”\nBesides, beheading was reserved for bridgemen who wouldn’t run at\nthe Parshendi. So long as he ran, he wouldn’t be executed. In fact, the army\nleaders seemed hesitant to do much to punish bridgemen at all. One man\nhad committed murder while Kaladin had been a bridgeman, and they’d\nstrung the fool up in a highstorm. But other than that, all Kaladin had seen\nwas a few men get their wages garnished for brawling, and a couple get\nwhipped for being too slow during the early part of a bridge run.\nMinimal punishments. The leaders of this army understood. The lives\nof bridgemen were as close to hopeless as possible; shove them down too\nmuch further, and the bridgemen might just stop caring and let themselves\nbe killed.\nUnfortunately, that also meant that there wouldn’t be much Kaladin\ncould do to punish his own crew, even if he’d had that authority. He had to\nmotivate them in another way. He crossed the lumberyard to where the\ncarpenters were constructing new bridges. After some searching, Kaladin\nfound what he wanted—a thick plank waiting to be fitted into a new\nportable bridge. A handhold for a bridgeman had been affixed to one side.\n“Can I borrow this?” Kaladin asked a passing carpenter.\nThe man raised a hand to scratch a sawdust-powdered head. “Borrow\nit?”\n“I’ll stay right here in the lumberyard,” Kaladin explained, lifting the\nboard and putting it on his shoulder. It was heavier than he’d expected, and\nhe was thankful for the padded leather vest.\n“We’ll need it eventually…” the carpenter said, but didn’t offer enough\nof an objection to stop Kaladin from walking away with the plank."

        "text": "he was thankful for the padded leather vest.\n“We’ll need it eventually…” the carpenter said, but didn’t offer enough\nof an objection to stop Kaladin from walking away with the plank.\nHe chose a level stretch of stone directly in front of the barracks. Then\nhe began to trot from one end of the lumberyard to the other, carrying the\nboard on his shoulder, feeling the heat of the rising sun on his skin. He went\nback and forth, back and forth. He practiced running, walking, and jogging.\nHe practiced carrying the plank on his shoulder, then carrying it up high,\narms stretched out.\nHe worked himself ragged. In fact, he felt close to collapsing several\ntimes, but every time he did, he found a reserve of strength from\nsomewhere. So he kept moving, teeth gritted against the pain and fatigue,\ncounting his steps to focus. The apprentice carpenter he’d spoken to brought\na supervisor over. That supervisor scratched his head beneath his cap,\nwatching Kaladin. Finally, he shrugged, and the two of them withdrew.\nBefore long, he drew a small crowd. Workers in the lumberyard, some\nsoldiers, and a large number of bridgemen. Some from the other bridge\ncrews called gibes, but the members of Bridge Four were more withdrawn.\nMany ignored him. Others—grizzled Teft, youthful-faced Dunny, several\nmore—stood watching in a line, as if they couldn’t believe what he was\ndoing.\nThose stares—stunned and hostile though they were—were part of\nwhat kept Kaladin going. He also ran to work out his frustration, that\nboiling, churning pot of anger within. Anger at himself for failing Tien.\nAnger at the Almighty for creating a world where some dined in luxury\nwhile others died carrying bridges.\nIt felt surprisingly good to wear himself down in a way he chose. He\nfelt as he had those first few months after Tien’s death, training himself on\nthe spear to forget. When the noon bells rang—calling the soldiers to lunch\n—Kaladin finally stopped and set the large plank down on the ground. He\nrolled his shoulder. He’d been running for hours. Where had he found the\nstrength?\nHe jogged over to the carpenter’s station, dripping sweat to the stones,\nand took a long drink from the water barrel. The carpenters usually chased\noff bridgemen who tried that, but none said a word as Kaladin slurped down\ntwo full ladles of metallic rainwater. He shook the ladle free and nodded to\na pair of apprentices, then jogged back to where he’d left the plank.\nRock—the large, tan-skinned Horneater—was hefting it, frowning.\nTeft noticed Kaladin, then nodded to Rock. “He bet a few of us a chip\neach that you’d used a lightweight board to impress us.”\nIf they could have felt his exhaustion, they wouldn’t have been so\nskeptical. He forced himself to take the plank from Rock. The large man let\nit go with a bewildered look, watching as Kaladin ran the plank back to\nwhere he’d found it. He waved his thanks to the apprentice, then trotted\nback to the small cluster of bridgemen. Rock was reluctantly paying out\nchips on his bet.\n“You’re dismissed for lunch,” Kaladin told them. “We have afternoon"

Our camp chore today is cleaning up after supper.\nLast one to arrive has to do the pots.”\nThey gave him bemused expressions as he trotted away from the\nlumberyard. Two streets away, he ducked into an alleyway and leaned\nagainst the wall. Then, wheezing, he sank to the ground and stretched out.\nHe felt as if he’d strained every muscle in his body. His legs burned,\nand when he tried to make his hand into a fist, the fingers were too weak to\nfully comply. He breathed in and out in deep gasps, coughing. A passing\nsoldier peeked in, but when he saw the bridgeman’s outfit, he left without a\nword.\nEventually, Kaladin felt a light touch on his chest. He opened his eyes\nand found Syl lying prone in the air, face toward his. Her feet were toward\nthe wall, but her posture—indeed, the way her dress hung—made it seem as\nif she were standing upright, not face toward the ground.\n“Kaladin,” she said, “I have something to tell you.”\nHe closed his eyes again.\n“Kaladin, this is important!” He felt a slight jolt of energy on his\neyelid. It was a very strange sensation. He grumbled, opening his eyes and\nforcing himself to sit. She walked in the air, as if circumnavigating an\ninvisible sphere, until she was standing up in the right direction.\n“I have decided,” Syl declared, “that I’m glad you kept your word to\nGaz, even if he is a disgusting person.”\nIt took Kaladin a moment to realize what she was talking about. “The\nspheres?”\nShe nodded. “I thought you might break your word, but I’m glad you\ndidn’t.”\n“All right. Well, thank you for telling me, I guess.”\n“Kaladin,” she said petulantly, making fists at her side. “This is\nimportant.”\n“I…” He trailed off, then rested his head back against the wall. “Syl, I\ncan barely breathe, let alone think. Please. Just tell me what’s bothering\nyou.”\n“I know what a lie is,” she said, moving over and sitting on his knee.\n“A few weeks ago, I didn’t even understand the concept of lying. But now\nI’m happy that you didn’t lie. Don’t you see?”\n“No.”\n“I’m changing.” She shivered—it must have been an intentional\naction, for her entire figure fuzzed for a moment. “I know things I didn’t\njust a few days ago. It feels so strange.”\n“Well, I guess that’s a good thing. I mean, the more you understand,\nthe better. Right?”\nShe looked down. “When I found you near the chasm after the\nhighstorm yesterday,” she whispered, “you were going to kill yourself,\nweren’t you?”\nKaladin didn’t respond. Yesterday.

You could have used it\nto kill yourself or someone else. That’s what you were probably planning to\nuse it for in the first place, back in the wagons.” She looked back up into his\neyes, and her tiny voice seemed terrified. “Today, I know what death is.\nWhy do I know what death is, Kaladin?”\nKaladin frowned. “You’ve always been odd, for a spren. Even from the\nstart.”\n“From the very start?”\nHe hesitated, thinking back. No, the first few times she’d come, she’d\nacted like any other windspren. Playing pranks on him, sticking his shoe to\nthe floor, then hiding. Even when she’d persisted with him during the\nmonths of his slavery, she’d acted mostly like any other spren. Losing\ninterest in things quickly, flitting around.\n“Yesterday, I didn’t know what death was,” she said. “Today I do.\nMonths ago, I didn’t know I was acting oddly for a spren, but I grew to\nrealize that I was. How do I even know how a spren is supposed to act?”\nShe shrank down, looking smaller. “What’s happening to me? What am I?”\n“I don’t know. Does it matter?”\n“Shouldn’t it?”\n“I don’t know what I am either. A bridgeman? A surgeon? A soldier? A\nslave? Those are all just labels. Inside, I’m me. A very different me than I\nwas a year ago, but I can’t worry about that, so I just keep moving and hope\nmy feet take me where I need to go.”\n“You aren’t angry at me for bringing you that leaf?”\n“Syl, if you hadn’t interrupted me, I’d have stepped off into the chasm.\nThat leaf was what I needed. It was the right thing, somehow.”\nShe smiled, and watched as Kaladin began to stretch. Once he finished,\nhe stood and stepped out onto the street again, mostly recovered from his\nexhaustion. She zipped into the air and rested on his shoulder, sitting with\nher arms back and her feet hanging down in front, like a girl on the side of a\ncliff. “I’m glad you’re not angry. Though I do think that you’re to blame for\nwhat’s happening to me. Before I met you, I never had to think about death\nor lying.”\n“That’s how I am,” he said dryly. “Bringing death and lies wherever I\ngo. Me and the Nightwatcher.”\nShe frowned.\n“That was—” he began.\n“Yes,” she said. “That was sarcasm.” She cocked her head. “I know\nwhat sarcasm is.” Then she smiled deviously. “I know what sarcasm is!”\nStormfather, Kaladin thought, looking into those gleeful little eyes.\nThat strikes me as ominous.\n“So, wait,” he said. “This sort of thing has never happened to you\nbefore?”\n“I don’t know.

I don’t like the idea of forgetting.”\n“But don’t death and lying make you uncomfortable?”\n“They do. But, if I were to lose these memories…” She glanced into\nthe air, and Kaladin traced her movements, noting a pair of windspren\ndarting through the sky on a gusting breeze, uncaring and free.\n“Scared to go onward,” Kaladin said, “but terrified to go back to what\nyou were.”\nShe nodded.\n“I know how you feel,” he said. “Come on. I need to eat, and there are\nsome things I want to pick up after lunch.”\nYou do not agree with my quest. I understand that, so much as it is\npossible to understand someone with whom I disagree so completely.\nFour hours after the chasmfiend attack, Adolin was still overseeing the\ncleanup. In the struggle, the monster had destroyed the bridge leading back\nto the warcamps. Fortunately, some soldiers had been left on the other side,\nand they’d gone to fetch a bridge crew.\nAdolin walked amid the soldiers, gathering reports as the late\nafternoon sun inched toward the horizon. The air had a musty, moldy scent.\nThe smell of greatshell blood. The beast itself lay where it had fallen, chest\ncut open. Some soldiers were harvesting its carapace amid cremlings that\nhad come out to feast on the carcass. To Adolin’s left, long lines of men lay\nin rows, using cloaks or shirts as pillows on the ragged plateau surface.\nSurgeons from Dalinar’s army tended them. Adolin blessed his father for\nalways bringing the surgeons, even on a routine expedition like this one.\nHe continued on his way, still wearing his Shardplate. The troops\ncould have made their way back to the warcamps by another route—there\nwas still a bridge on the other side, leading farther out onto the Plains. They\ncould have moved eastward, then wrapped back around. Dalinar, however,\nhad made the call—much to Sadeas’s dismay—that they would wait and\ntend the wounded, resting the few hours it would take to get a bridge crew.\nAdolin glanced toward the pavilion, which tinkled with laughter.\nSeveral large rubies glowed brightly, set atop poles, with worked golden\ntines holding them in place. They were fabrials that gave off heat, though\nthere was no fire involved. He didn’t understand how fabrials worked,\nthough the more spectacular ones needed large gemstones to function.\nOnce again, the other lighteyes enjoyed their leisure while he worked.\nThis time he didn’t mind. He would have found it difficult to enjoy himself\nafter such a disaster. And it had been a disaster. A minor lighteyed officer\napproached, carrying a final list of casualties. The man’s wife read it, then\nthey left him with the sheet and retreated."

        "text": "after such a disaster. And it had been a disaster. A minor lighteyed officer\napproached, carrying a final list of casualties. The man’s wife read it, then\nthey left him with the sheet and retreated.\nThere were nearly fifty men dead, twice as many wounded. Many were\nmen Adolin had known. When the king had been given the initial estimate,\nhe had brushed aside the deaths, indicating that they’d be rewarded for their\nvalor with positions in the Heraldic Forces above. He seemed to have\nconveniently forgotten that he’d have been one of the casualties himself, if\nnot for Dalinar.\nAdolin sought out his father with his eyes; Dalinar stood at the edge of\nthe plateau, looking eastward again. What did he search for out there? This\nwasn’t the first time Adolin had seen such extraordinary actions from his\nfather, but they had seemed particularly dramatic. Standing beneath the\nmassive chasmfiend, holding it back from killing his nephew, Plate\nglowing. That image was fixed in Adolin’s memory.\nThe other lighteyes stepped more lightly around Dalinar now, and\nduring the last few hours, Adolin hadn’t heard a single mention of his\nweakness, not even from Sadeas’s men. He feared it wouldn’t last. Dalinar\nwas heroic, but only infrequently. In the weeks that followed, the others\nwould begin to talk again of how he rarely went on plateau assaults, about\nhow he’d lost his edge.\nAdolin found himself thirsting for more. Today when Dalinar had\nleaped to protect Elhokar, he’d acted like the stories said he had during his\nyouth. Adolin wanted that man back. The kingdom needed him.\nAdolin sighed, turning away. He needed to give the final casualty\nreport to the king. Likely he’d be mocked for it, but perhaps—in waiting to\ndeliver it—he might be able to listen in on Sadeas. Adolin still felt he was\nmissing something about that man. Something his father saw, but he did\nnot.\nSo, steeling himself for the barbs, he made his way toward the\npavilion.\nDalinar faced eastward with gauntleted hands clasped behind his back.\nSomewhere out there, at the center of the Plains, the Parshendi made their\nbase camp.\nAlethkar had been at war for nearly six years, engaging in an extended\nsiege. The siege strategy had been suggested by Dalinar himself—striking\nat the Parshendi base would have required camping on the Plains,\nweathering highstorms, and relying on a large number of fragile bridges.\nOne failed battle, and the Alethi could have found themselves trapped and\nsurrounded, without any way back to fortified positions.\nBut the Shattered Plains could also be a trap for the Parshendi. The\neastern and southern edges were impassable—the plateaus there were\nweathered to the point that many were little more than spires, and the\nParshendi could not jump the distance between them. The Plains were\nedged by mountains, and packs of chasmfiends prowled the land between,\nenormous and dangerous.\nWith the Alethi army boxing them in on the west and north—and with\nscouts placed south and east just in case—the Parshendi could not escape.\nDalinar had argued that the Parshendi would run out of supplies.

        "text": "scouts placed south and east just in case—the Parshendi could not escape.\nDalinar had argued that the Parshendi would run out of supplies. They’d\neither have to expose themselves and try to escape the Plains, or would\nhave to attack the Alethi in their fortified warcamps.\nIt had been an excellent plan. Except, Dalinar hadn’t anticipated the\ngemhearts.\nHe turned from the chasm, walking across the plateau. He itched to go\nsee to his men, but he needed to show trust in Adolin. He was in command,\nand he would do well by it. In fact, it seemed he was already taking some\nfinal reports over to Elhokar.\nDalinar smiled, looking at his son. Adolin was shorter than Dalinar,\nand his hair was blond mixed with black. The blond was an inheritance\nfrom his mother, or so Dalinar had been told. Dalinar himself remembered\nnothing of the woman. She had been excised from his memory, leaving\nstrange gaps and foggy areas. Sometimes he could remember an exact\nscene, with everyone else crisp and clear, but she was a blur. He couldn’t\neven remember her name. When others spoke it, it slipped from his mind,\nlike a pat of butter sliding off a too-hot knife.\nHe left Adolin to make his report and walked up to the chasmfiend’s\ncarcass. It lay slumped over on its side, eyes burned out, mouth lying open.\nThere was no tongue, just the curious teeth of a greatshell, with a strange,\ncomplex network of jaws. Some flat platelike teeth for crushing and\ndestroying shells and other, smaller mandibles for ripping off flesh or\nshoving it deeper into the throat. Rockbuds had opened nearby, their vines\nreaching out to lap up the beast’s blood. There was a connection between a\nman and the beast he hunted, and Dalinar always felt a strange melancholy\nafter killing a creature as majestic as a chasmfiend.\nMost gemhearts were harvested quite differently than the one had been\ntoday. Sometime during the strange life cycle of the chasmfiends, they\nsought the western side of the Plains, where the plateaus were wider. They\nclimbed up onto the tops and made a rocky chrysalis, waiting for the\ncoming of a highstorm.\nDuring that time, they were vulnerable. You just had to get to the\nplateau where it rested, break into its chrysalis with some mallets or a\nShardblade, then cut out the gemheart. Easy work for a fortune. And the\nbeasts came frequently, often several times a week, so long as the weather\ndidn’t get too cold.\nDalinar looked up at the hulking carcass. Tiny, near-invisible spren\nwere floating out of the beast’s body, vanishing into the air. They looked\nlike the tongues of smoke that might come off a candle after being snuff ed.\nNobody knew what kind of spren they were; you only saw them around the\nfreshly killed bodies of greatshells.\nHe shook his head. The gemhearts had changed everything for the war.\nThe Parshendi wanted them too, wanted them badly enough to extend\nthemselves. Fighting the Parshendi for the greatshells made sense, for the"

        "text": "The Parshendi wanted them too, wanted them badly enough to extend\nthemselves. Fighting the Parshendi for the greatshells made sense, for the\nParshendi could not replenish their troops from home as the Alethi could.\nSo contests over the greatshells were both profitable and a tactically sound\nway of advancing the siege.\nWith the evening coming on, Dalinar could see lights twinkling across\nthe Plains. Towers where men watched for chasmfiends coming up to\npupate. They’d watch through the night, though chasmfiends rarely came in\nthe evening or night. The scouts crossed chasms with jumping poles,\nmoving very lightly from plateau to plateau without the need of bridges.\nOnce a chasmfiend was spotted the scouts would sound warning, and it\nbecame a race—Alethi against Parshendi. Seize the plateau and hold it long\nenough to get out the gemheart, attack the enemy if they got there first.\nEach highprince wanted those gemhearts. Paying and feeding\nthousands of troops was not cheap, but a single gemheart could cover a\nhighprince’s expenses for months. Beyond that, the larger a gemstone was\nwhen used by a Soulcaster, the less likely it was to shatter. Enormous\ngemheart stones offered near-limitless potential. And so, the highprinces\nraced. The first one to a chrysalis got to fight the Parshendi for the\ngemheart.\nThey could have taken turns, but that was not the Alethi way.\nCompetition was doctrine to them. Vorinism taught that the finest warriors\nwould have the holy privilege of joining the Heralds after death, fighting to\nreclaim the Tranquiline Halls from the Voidbringers. The highprinces were\nallies, but they were also rivals. To give up a gemheart to another…well, it\nfelt wrong. Better to have a contest. And so what had been a war had\nbecome sport instead. Deadly sport—but that was the best kind.\nDalinar left the fallen chasmfiend behind. He understood each step in\nthe process of what had happened during these six years. He’d even\nhastened some of them. Only now did he worry. They were making\nheadway in cutting down the Parshendi numbers, but the original goal of\nvengeance for Gavilar’s murder had nearly been forgotten. The Alethi\nlounged, they played, and they idled.\nEven though they’d killed plenty of Parshendi—as many as a quarter\nof their originally estimated forces were dead—this was just taking so long.\nThe siege had lasted six years, and could easily take another six. That\ntroubled him. Obviously the Parshendi had expected to be besieged here.\nThey’d prepared supply dumps and had been ready to move their entire\npopulation to the Shattered Plains, where they could use these Heralds-\nforsaken chasms and plateaus like hundreds of moats and fortifications.\nElhokar had sent messengers, demanding to know why the Parshendi\nhad killed his father. They had never given an answer. They’d taken credit\nfor his murder, but had offered no explanation. Of late, it seemed that\nDalinar was the only one who still wondered about that."

Of late, it seemed that\nDalinar was the only one who still wondered about that.\nDalinar turned to the side; Elhokar’s attendants had retired to the\npavilion, enjoying wine and refreshments. The large open-sided tent was\ndyed violet and yellow, and a light breeze ruffled the canvas. There was a\nsmall chance that another highstorm might arrive tonight, the stormwardens\nsaid. Almighty send that the army was back to the camp if one did come.\nHighstorms. Visions.\nUnite them….\nDid he really believe in what he’d seen? Did he really think that the\nAlmighty himself had spoken to him? Dalinar Kholin, the Blackthorn, a\nfearsome warlord?\nUnite them.\nAt the pavilion, Sadeas walked out into the night. He had removed his\nhelm, revealing a head of thick black hair that curled and tumbled around\nhis shoulders. He cut an imposing figure in his Plate; he certainly looked\nmuch better in armor than he did wearing one of those ridiculous costumes\nof lace and silk that were popular these days.\nSadeas caught Dalinar’s eyes, nodding slightly. My part is done, that\nnod said. Sadeas strolled for a moment, then reentered the pavilion.\nSo. Sadeas had remembered the reason for inviting Vamah on the hunt.\nDalinar would have to seek out Vamah. He made his way toward the\npavilion. Adolin and Renarin lurked near the king. Had the lad given his\nreport yet? It seemed likely that Adolin was trying—yet again—to listen in\non Sadeas’s conversations with the king. Dalinar would have to do\nsomething about that; the boy’s personal rivalry with Sadeas was\nunderstandable, perhaps, but counterproductive.\nSadeas was chatting with the king. Dalinar made to go find Vamah—\nthe other highprince was near the back of the pavilion—but the king\ninterrupted him.\n“Dalinar,” the king said. “Come here. Sadeas tells me he has won three\ngemhearts in the last few weeks alone!”\n“He has indeed,” Dalinar said, approaching.\n“How many have you won?”\n“Including the one today?”\n“No,” the king said. “Before this.”\n“None, Your Majesty,” Dalinar admitted.\n“It’s Sadeas’s bridges,” Elhokar said. “They’re more efficient than\nyours.”\n“I may not have won anything the last few weeks,” Dalinar said stiffly,\n“but my army has won its share of skirmishes in the past.” And the\ngemhearts can go to Damnation, for all I care.\n“Perhaps,” Elhokar said, “but what have you done lately?”\n“I have been busy with other important things.”\nSadeas raised an eyebrow. “More important than the war? More\nimportant than vengeance? Is that possible? Or are you just making\nexcuses?”\nDalinar gave the other highprince a pointed look. Sadeas just\nshrugged. They were allies, but they were not friends. Not any longer.\n“You should switch to bridges like his,” Elhokar said."

Not any longer.\n“You should switch to bridges like his,” Elhokar said.\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “Sadeas’s bridges waste many lives.”\n“But they are also fast,” Sadeas said smoothly. “Relying on wheeled\nbridges is foolish, Dalinar. Getting them over this plateau terrain is slow\nand plodding.”\n“The Codes state that a general may not ask a man to do anything he\nwould not do himself. Tell me, Sadeas. Would you run at the front of those\nbridges you use?”\n“I wouldn’t eat gruel either,” Sadeas said dryly, “or cut ditches.”\n“But you might if you had to,” Dalinar said. “The bridges are different.\nStormfather, you don’t even let them use armor or shields! Would you enter\ncombat without your Plate?”\n“The bridgemen serve a very important function,” Sadeas snapped.\n“They distract the Parshendi from firing at my soldiers. I tried giving them\nshields at first. And you know what? The Parshendi ignored the bridgemen\nand fired volleys onto my soldiers and horses. I found that by doubling the\nnumber of bridges on a run, then making them extremely light—no armor,\nno shields to slow them—the bridgemen work far better.\n“You see, Dalinar? The Parshendi are too tempted by the exposed\nbridgemen to fire at anyone else! Yes, we lose a few bridge crews in each\nassault, but rarely so many that it hinders us. The Parshendi just keep firing\nat them—I assume that, for whatever reason, they think killing the\nbridgemen hurts us. As if an unarmored man carrying a bridge was worth\nthe same to the army as a mounted knight in Plate.” Sadeas shook his head\nin amusement at the thought.\nDalinar frowned. Brother, Gavilar had written. You must find the most\nimportant words a man can say…. A quote from the ancient text The Way of\nKings. It would disagree strongly with the things Sadeas was implying.\n“Regardless,” Sadeas continued. “Surely you can’t argue with how\neffective my method has been.”\n“Sometimes,” Dalinar said, “the prize is not worth the costs. The\nmeans by which we achieve victory are as important as the victory itself.”\nSadeas looked at Dalinar incredulously. Even Adolin and Renarin—\nwho had come closer—seemed shocked by the statement. It was a very un-\nAlethi way of thinking.\nWith the visions and the words of that book spinning in his mind\nlately, Dalinar wasn’t feeling particularly Alethi.\n“The prize is worth any cost, Brightlord Dalinar,” Sadeas said.\n“Winning the competition is worth any effort, any expense.”\n“It is a war,” Dalinar said. “Not a contest.”\n“Everything is a contest,” Sadeas said with a wave of his hand. “All\ndealings among men are a contest in which some will succeed and others\nfail. And some are failing quite spectacularly.”\n“My father is one of the most renowned warriors in Alethkar!” Adolin"

And some are failing quite spectacularly.”\n“My father is one of the most renowned warriors in Alethkar!” Adolin\nsnapped, butting into the group. The king raised an eyebrow at him, but\notherwise stayed out of the conversation. “You saw what he did earlier,\nSadeas, while you were hiding back by the pavilion with your bow. My\nfather held off the beast. You’re a cowa—”\n“Adolin!” Dalinar said. That was going too far. “Restrain yourself.”\nAdolin clenched his jaw, hand to his side, as if itching to summon his\nShardblade. Renarin stepped forward and gently placed a hand on Adolin’s\narm. Reluctantly, Adolin backed down.\nSadeas turned to Dalinar, smirking. “One son can barely control\nhimself, and the other is incompetent. This is your legacy, old friend?”\n“I am proud of them both, Sadeas, whatever you think.”\n“The firebrand I can understand,” Sadeas said. “You were once\nimpetuous just like him. But the other one? You saw how he ran out onto\nthe field today. He even forgot to draw his sword or bow! He’s useless!”\nRenarin flushed, looking down. Adolin snapped his head up. He thrust\nhis hand to the side again, stepping forward toward Sadeas.\n“Adolin!” Dalinar said. “I will handle this!”\nAdolin looked at him, blue eyes alight with rage, but he did not\nsummon his Blade.\nDalinar turned his attention to Sadeas, speaking very softly, very\npointedly. “Sadeas. Surely I did not just hear you openly—before the king\n—call my son useless. Surely you would not say that, as such an insult\nwould demand that I summon my Blade and seek your blood. Shatter the\nVengeance Pact. Cause the king’s two greatest allies to kill one another.\nSurely you would not have been that foolish. Surely I misheard.”\nEverything grew still. Sadeas hesitated. He didn’t back down; he met\nDalinar’s gaze. But he did hesitate.\n“Perhaps,” Sadeas said slowly, “you did hear the wrong words. I\nwould not insult your son. That would not have been…wise of me.”\nAn understanding passed between them, stares locked, and Dalinar\nnodded. Sadeas did as well—one curt nod of the head. They would not let\ntheir hatred of one another become a danger to the king. Barbs were one\nthing, but dueling offenses were another. They couldn’t risk that.\n“Well,” Elhokar said. He allowed his highprinces to jostle and contend\nfor status and influence. He believed they were all stronger for it, and few\nfaulted him; it was an established method of rule. More and more, Dalinar\nfound himself disagreeing.\nUnite them….\n“I guess we can be done with that,” Elhokar said.\nTo the side, Adolin looked unsatisfied, as if he’d really been hoping\nthat Dalinar would summon his Blade and confront Sadeas. Dalinar’s own\nblood felt hot, the Thrill tempting him, but he shoved it down. No. Not here."

Not while Elhokar needed them.\n“Perhaps we can be done, Your Majesty,” Sadeas said. “Though I\ndoubt this particular discussion between Dalinar and me will ever be done.\nAt least until he relearns how to act as a man should.”\n“I said that is quite enough, Sadeas,” Elhokar said.\n“Quite enough, you say?” a new voice added. “I believe that a single\nword from Sadeas is ‘quite enough’ for anyone.” Wit picked his way\nthrough the groups of attendants, holding a cup of wine in one hand, silver\nsword belted at his side.\n“Wit!” Elhokar exclaimed. “When did you get here?”\n“I caught up to your party just before the battle, Your Majesty,” Wit\nsaid, bowing. “I was going to speak with you, but the chasmfiend beat me to\nyou. I hear your conversation with it was rather energizing.”\n“But, you arrived hours ago, then! What have you been doing? How\ncould I have missed seeing you here?”\n“I had…things to be about,” Wit said. “But I couldn’t stay away from\nthe hunt. I wouldn’t want you to lack for me.”\n“I’ve done well so far.”\n“And yet, you were still Witless,” Wit noted.\nDalinar studied the black-clad man. What to make of Wit? He was\nclever. And yet, he was too free with his thoughts, as he’d shown with\nRenarin earlier. This Wit had a strange air about him that Dalinar couldn’t\nquite place.\n“Brightlord Sadeas,” Wit said, taking a sip of wine. “I’m terribly sorry\nto see you here.”\n“I should think,” Sadeas said dryly, “that you would be happy to see\nme. I seem always to provide you with such entertainment.”\n“That is unfortunately true,” Wit said.\n“Unfortunately?”\n“Yes. You see, Sadeas, you make it too easy. An uneducated, half-\nbrained serving boy with a hangover could make mock of you. I am left\nwith no need to exert myself, and your very nature makes mockery of my\nmockery. And so it is that through sheer stupidity you make me look\nincompetent.”\n“Really, Elhokar,” Sadeas said. “Must we put up with this…creature?”\n“I like him,” Elhokar said, smiling. “He makes me laugh.”\n“At the expense of those who are loyal to you.”\n“Expense?” Wit cut in. “Sadeas, I don’t believe you’ve ever paid me a\nsphere. Though no, please, don’t offer. I can’t take your money, as I know\nhow many others you must pay to get what you wish of them.”\nSadeas flushed, but kept his temper. “A whore joke, Wit? Is that the\nbest you can manage?”\nWit shrugged. “I point out truths when I see them, Brightlord Sadeas.\nEach man has his place. Mine is to make insults. Yours is to be in-sluts.”"

Yours is to be in-sluts.”\nSadeas froze, then grew red-faced. “You are a fool.”\n“If the Wit is a fool, then it is a sorry state for men. I shall offer you\nthis, Sadeas. If you can speak, yet say nothing ridiculous, I will leave you\nalone for the rest of the week.”\n“Well, I think that shouldn’t be too difficult.”\n“And yet you failed,” Wit said, sighing. “For you said ‘I think’ and I\ncan imagine nothing so ridiculous as the concept of you thinking. What of\nyou, young Prince Renarin? Your father wishes me to leave you alone. Can\nyou speak, yet say nothing ridiculous?”\nEyes turned toward Renarin, who stood just behind his brother.\nRenarin hesitated, eyes opening wide at the attention. Dalinar grew tense.\n“Nothing ridiculous,” Renarin said slowly.\nWit laughed. “Yes, I suppose that will satisfy me. Very clever. If\nBrightlord Sadeas should lose control of himself and finally kill me,\nperhaps you can be King’s Wit in my stead. You seem to have the mind for\nit.”\nRenarin perked up, which darkened Sadeas’s mood further. Dalinar\neyed the highprince; Sadeas’s hand had gone to his sword. Not a\nShardblade, for Sadeas didn’t have one. But he did carry a lighteyes’s side\nsword. Plenty deadly; Dalinar had fought beside Sadeas on many occasions,\nand the man was an expert swordsman.\nWit stepped forward. “So what of it, Sadeas?” he asked softly. “You\ngoing to do Alethkar a favor and rid it of us both?”\nKilling the King’s Wit was legal. But by so doing, Sadeas would\nforfeit his title and lands. Most men found it a poor enough trade not to do it\nin the open. Of course, if you could assassinate a Wit without anyone\nknowing it was you, that was something different.\nSadeas slowly removed his hand from the hilt of his sword, then\nnodded curtly to the king and strode away.\n“Wit,” Elhokar said, “Sadeas has my favor. There’s no need to torment\nhim so.”\n“I disagree,” Wit said. “The king’s favor may be torment enough for\nmost men, but not him.”\nThe king sighed and looked toward Dalinar. “I should go placate\nSadeas. I’ve been meaning to ask you, though. Have you looked into the\nissue I asked you about earlier?”\nDalinar shook his head. “I have been busy with the needs of the army.\nBut I will look into it now, Your Majesty.”\nThe king nodded, then hastened off after Sadeas.\n“What was that, Father?” Adolin asked. “Is it about the people he\nthinks were spying on him?”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “This is something new.

He\nnoticed Dalinar watching and winked, then walked away.\n“I like him,” Adolin repeated.\n“I might be persuaded to agree,” Dalinar said, rubbing his chin.\n“Renarin,” Dalinar said, “go and get a report on the wounded. Adolin, come\nwith me. We need to check into the matter the king spoke of.”\nBoth young men looked confused, but they did as requested. Dalinar\nstarted across the plateau toward where the carcass of the chasmfiend lay.\nLet us see what your worries have brought us this time, nephew, he\nthought.\nAdolin turned the long leather strap over in his hands. Almost a handspan\nwide and a finger’s width thick, the strap ended in a ragged tear. It was the\ngirth to the king’s saddle, the strap that wrapped under the horse’s barrel. It\nhad broken suddenly during the fight, throwing the saddle—and the king—\nfrom horseback.\n“What do you think?” Dalinar asked.\n“I don’t know,” Adolin said. “It doesn’t look that worn, but I guess it\nwas, otherwise it wouldn’t have snapped, right?\nDalinar took the strap back, looking contemplative. The soldiers still\nhadn’t returned with the bridge crew, though the sky was darkening.\n“Father,” Adolin said. “Why would Elhokar ask us to look into this?\nDoes he expect us to discipline the grooms for not properly caring for his\nsaddle? Is it…” Adolin trailed off, and he suddenly understood his father’s\nhesitation. “The king thinks the strap was cut, doesn’t he?”\nDalinar nodded. He turned it over in his gauntleted fingers, and Adolin\ncould see him thinking about it. A girth could get so worn that it would\nsnap, particularly when strained by the weight of a man in Shardplate. This\nstrap had broken off at the point where it had been affixed to the saddle, so\nit would have been easy for the grooms to miss it. That was the most\nrational explanation. But when looked at with slightly more irrational eyes,\nit could seem that something nefarious had happened.\n“Father,” Adolin said, “he’s getting increasingly paranoid. You know\nhe is.”\nDalinar didn’t reply.\n“He sees assassins in every shadow,” Adolin continued. “Straps break.\nThat doesn’t mean someone tried to kill him.”\n“If the king is worried,” Dalinar said, “we should look into it. The\nbreak is smoother on one side, as if it were sliced so that it would rip when\nit was stressed.”\nAdolin frowned. “Maybe.” He hadn’t noticed that. “But think about it,\nFather. Why would someone cut his strap? A fall from horseback wouldn’t\nharm a Shardbearer. If it was an assassination attempt, then it was an\nincompetent one.”\n“If it was an assassination attempt,” Dalinar said, “even an\nincompetent one, then we have something to worry about. It happened on\nour watch, and his horse was cared for by our grooms. We will look into\nthis.”\nAdolin groaned, some of his frustration slipping out. “The others"

What\nwill they say if they hear that we’re chasing down his every paranoid worry,\nno matter how irrational?”\n“I have never cared what they say.”\n“We spend all our time on bureaucracy while others win wealth and\nglory. We rarely go on plateau assaults because we’re busy doing things like\nthis! We need to be out there, fighting, if we’re ever going to catch up to\nSadeas!”\nDalinar looked at him, frown deepening, and Adolin bit off his next\noutburst.\n“I see that we’re no longer talking about this broken girth,” Dalinar\nsaid.\n“I…I’m sorry. I spoke in haste.”\n“Perhaps you did. But then again, perhaps I needed to hear it. I noticed\nthat you didn’t particularly like how I held you back from Sadeas earlier.”\n“I know you hate him too, Father.”\n“You do not know as much as you presume you do,” Dalinar said.\n“We’ll do something about that in a moment. For now, I swear…this strap\ndoes look like it was cut. Perhaps there is something we’re not seeing. This\ncould have been part of something larger that didn’t work the way it had\nbeen anticipated.”\nAdolin hesitated. It seemed overcomplicated, but if there was a group\nwho liked their plots overly complicated, it was the Alethi lighteyes. “Do\nyou think one of the highprinces may have tried something?”\n“Maybe,” Dalinar said. “But I doubt any of them want him dead. So\nlong as Elhokar rules, the highprinces get to fight in this war their way and\nfatten their purses. He doesn’t make many demands of them. They like\nhaving him as their king.”\n“Men can covet the throne for the distinction alone.”\n“True. When we return, see if anyone has been bragging too much of\nlate. Check to see if Roion is still bitter about Wit’s insult at the feast last\nweek and have Talata go over the contracts Highprince Bethab offered to\nthe king for the use of his chulls. In previous contracts, he’s tried to slip in\nlanguage that would favor his claim in a succession. He’s been bold ever\nsince your aunt Navani left.”\nAdolin nodded.\n“See if you can backtrack the girth’s history,” Dalinar said. “Have a\nleatherworker look at it and tell you what he thinks of the rip. Ask the\ngrooms if they noticed anything, and watch to see if any have received any\nsuspicious windfalls of spheres lately.” He hesitated. “And double the\nking’s guard.”\nAdolin turned, glancing at the pavilion. Sadeas was strolling out of it.\nAdolin narrowed his eyes. “Do you think—”\n“No,” Dalinar interrupted.\n“Sadeas is an eel.”\n“Son, you have to stop fixating on him. He likes Elhokar, which can’t\nbe said of most of the others. He’s one of the few I’d trust the king’s safety\nto.”\n“I wouldn’t do the same, Father, I can tell you that.”"

He’s one of the few I’d trust the king’s safety\nto.”\n“I wouldn’t do the same, Father, I can tell you that.”\nDalinar fell silent for a moment. “Come with me.” He handed Adolin\nthe saddle strap, then began to cross the plateau toward the pavilion. “I want\nto show you something about Sadeas.”\nResigned, Adolin followed. They passed the lit pavilion. Inside,\ndarkeyed men served food and drink while women sat and scribed messages\nor wrote accounts of the battle. The lighteyes spoke with one another in\nverbose, excited tones, complimenting the king’s bravery. The men wore\ndark, masculine colors: maroon, navy, forest green, deep burnt orange.\nDalinar approached Highprince Vamah, who stood outside the pavilion\nwith a group of his own lighteyed attendants. He was dressed in a\nfashionable long brown coat that had slashes cut through it to expose the\nbright yellow silk lining. It was a subdued fashion, not as ostentatious as\nwearing silks on the outside. Adolin thought it looked nice.\nVamah himself was a round-faced, balding man. The short hair that\nremained stuck straight up, and he had light grey eyes. He had a habit of\nsquinting—which he did as Dalinar and Adolin approached.\nWhat is this about? Adolin wondered.\n“Brightlord,” Dalinar said to Vamah. “I have come to make certain\nyour comfort has been seen to.”\n“My comfort would be best seen to if we could be on our way back.”\nVamah glared over at the setting sun, as if blaming it for some misdeed. He\nwasn’t normally so foul-mooded.\n“I’m certain that my men are moving as quickly as they can,” Dalinar\nsaid.\n“It wouldn’t be nearly as late if you hadn’t slowed us so much on the\nway here,” Vamah said.\n“I like to be careful,” Dalinar said. “And, speaking of care, there is\nsomething I’ve been meaning to talk to you about. Might my son and I\nspeak to you alone for a moment?”\nVamah scowled, but let Dalinar lead him away from his attendants.\nAdolin followed, more and more baffled.\n“The beast was a large one,” Dalinar said to Vamah, nodding toward\nthe fallen chasmfiend. “The biggest I’ve seen.”\n“I suppose.”\n“I hear you’ve had success on your recent plateau assaults, killing a\nfew cocooned chasmfiends of your own. You are to be congratulated.”\nVamah shrugged. “The ones we won were small. Nothing like that\ngemheart that Elhokar took today.”\n“A small gemheart is better than none,” Dalinar said politely. “I hear\nthat you have plans to augment the walls of your warcamp.”\n“Hum? Yes. Fill in a few of the gaps, improve the fortification.”\n“I’ll be certain to tell His Majesty that you’ll be wanting to purchase\nextra access to the Soulcasters.”\nVamah turned to him, frowning. “Soulcasters?”\n“For lumber,” Dalinar said evenly. “Surely you don’t intend to fill in"

Out here, on these remote plains, it’s\nfortunate that we have Soulcasters to provide things like wood, wouldn’t\nyou say?”\n“Er, yes,” Vamah said, expression darkening further. Adolin looked\nfrom him to his father. There was a subtext to the conversation. Dalinar\nwasn’t speaking only of wood for the walls—the Soulcasters were the\nmeans by which all of the highprinces fed their armies.\n“The king is quite generous in allowing access to the Soulcasters,”\nDalinar said. “Wouldn’t you agree, Vamah?”\n“I take your point, Dalinar,” Vamah said dryly. “No need to keep\nbashing the rock into my face.”\n“I’ve never been known as a subtle man, Brightlord,” Dalinar said.\n“Just an effective one.” He walked away, waving for Adolin to follow.\nAdolin did so, looking over his shoulder at the other highprince.\n“He’s been complaining vocally about the fees that Elhokar charges to\nuse his Soulcasters,” Dalinar said softly. It was the primary form of taxation\nthe king levied on the highprinces. Elhokar himself didn’t fight for, or win,\ngemhearts except on the occasional hunt. He stood aloof from fighting\npersonally in the war, as was appropriate.\n“And so…?” Adolin said.\n“So I reminded Vamah of how much he relies on the king.”\n“I suppose that’s important. But what does it have to do with Sadeas?”\nDalinar didn’t answer. He kept walking across the plateau, stepping up\nto the lip of the chasm. Adolin joined him, waiting. A few seconds later,\nsomeone approached from behind in clinking Shardplate, then Sadeas\nstepped up beside Dalinar at the lip of the chasm. Adolin narrowed his eyes\nat the man, and Sadeas raised an eyebrow, but said nothing about his\npresence.\n“Dalinar,” Sadeas said, turning his eyes forward, looking out across\nthe Plains.\n“Sadeas.” Dalinar’s voice was controlled and curt.\n“You spoke with Vamah?”\n“Yes. He saw through what I was doing.”\n“Of course he did.” There was a hint of amusement in Sadeas’s voice.\n“I wouldn’t have expected anything else.”\n“You told him you were increasing what you charge him for wood?”\nSadeas controlled the only large forest in the region. “Doubling it,”\nSadeas said.\nAdolin looked over his shoulder. Vamah was watching them stand\nthere, and his expression was as thunderous as a highstorm, angerspren\nboiling up from the ground around him like small pools of bubbling blood.\nDalinar and Sadeas together sent him a very sound message. Why…this is\nprobably why they invited him on the hunt, Adolin realized. So they could\nmaneuver him.\n“Will it work?” Dalinar asked.\n“I’m certain it will,” Sadeas said. “Vamah’s an agreeable enough"

His are the grand ideals of\njustice, holding the sword high as he rides against his father’s enemies.”\n“Lately, he seems less preoccupied with the Parshendi, and more\nworried about assassins in the night,” Dalinar said. “The boy’s paranoia\nworries me. I don’t know where he gets it.”\nSadeas laughed. “Dalinar, are you serious?”\n“I’m always serious.”\n“I know, I know. But surely you can see where the boy comes by the\nparanoia!”\n“From the way his father was killed?”\n“From the way his uncle treats him! A thousand guards? Halts on each\nand every plateau to let soldiers ‘secure’ the next one over? Really,\nDalinar?”\n“I like to be careful.”\n“Others call that being paranoid.”\n“The Codes—”\n“The Codes are a bunch of idealized nonsense,” Sadeas said, “devised\nby poets to describe the way they think things should have been.”\n“Gavilar believed in them.”\n“And look where it got him.”\n“And where were you, Sadeas, when he was fighting for his life?”\nSadeas’s eyes narrowed. “So we’re going to rehash that now? Like old\nlovers, crossing paths unexpectedly at a feast?”\nAdolin’s father didn’t reply. Once again, Adolin found himself baffled\nby Dalinar’s relationship with Sadeas. Their barbs were genuine; one\nneeded only look in their eyes to see that the men could barely stand one\nanother.\nAnd yet, here they were, apparently planning and executing a joint\nmanipulation of another highprince.\n“I’ll protect the boy my way,” Sadeas said. “You do it your way. But\ndon’t complain to me about his paranoia when you insist on wearing your\nuniform to bed, just in case the Parshendi suddenly decide—against all\nreason and precedent—to attack the warcamps. ‘I don’t know where he gets\nit’ indeed!”\n“Let’s go, Adolin,” Dalinar said, turning to stride away. Adolin\nfollowed.\n“Dalinar,” Sadeas called from behind.\nDalinar hesitated, looking back.\n“Have you found it yet?” Sadeas asked. “Why he wrote what he did?”\nDalinar shook his head.\n“You’re not going to find the answer,” Sadeas said. “It’s a foolish\nquest, old friend. One that’s tearing you apart. I know what happens to you\nduring storms. Your mind is unraveling because of all this stress you put\nupon yourself.”\nDalinar returned to walking away.

What had\nthat last part been about? Why “he” wrote? Men didn’t write. Adolin\nopened his mouth to ask, but he could sense his father’s mood. This was not\na time to prod him.\nHe walked with Dalinar up to a small rock hill on the plateau. They\npicked their way up it to the top, and from there looked out at the fallen\nchasmfiend. Dalinar’s men continued harvesting its meat and carapace.\nHe and his father stood there for a time, Adolin brimming with\nquestions, yet unable to find a way to phrase them.\nEventually, Dalinar spoke. “Have I ever told you what Gavilar’s final\nwords to me were?”\n“You haven’t. I’ve always wondered about that night.”\n“‘Brother, follow the Codes tonight. There is something strange upon\nthe winds.’ That’s what he said to me, the last thing he told me just before\nwe began the treaty-signing celebration.”\n“I didn’t realize that Uncle Gavilar followed the Codes.”\n“He’s the one who first showed them to me. He found them as a relic\nof old Alethkar, back when we’d first been united. He began following them\nshortly before he died.” Dalinar grew hesitant. “Those were odd days, son.\nJasnah and I weren’t sure what to think of the changes in Gavilar. At the\ntime, I thought the Codes foolishness, even the one that commanded an\nofficer to avoid strong drink during times of war. Especially that one.” His\nvoice grew even softer. “I was unconscious on the ground when Gavilar\nwas murdered. I can remember voices, trying to wake me up, but I was too\naddled by my wine. I should have been there for him.”\nHe looked to Adolin. “I cannot live in the past. It is foolishness to do\nso. I blame myself for Gavilar’s death, but there is nothing to be done for\nhim now.”\nAdolin nodded.\n“Son, I keep hoping that if I make you follow the Codes long enough,\nyou will see—as I have—their importance. Hopefully you will not need as\ndramatic an example of it as I did. Regardless, you need to understand. You\nspeak of Sadeas, of beating him, of competing with him. Do you know of\nSadeas’s part in my brother’s death?”\n“He was the decoy,” Adolin said. Sadeas, Gavilar, and Dalinar had\nbeen good friends up until the king’s death. Everyone knew it. They had\nconquered Alethkar together.\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “He was with the king and heard the soldiers\ncrying that a Shardbearer was attacking. The decoy idea was Sadeas’s plan\n—he put on one of Gavilar’s robes and fled in Gavilar’s place. It was\nsuicide, what he did. Wearing no Plate, making a Shardbearer assassin\nchase him. I honestly think it was one of the bravest things I’ve ever known\na man to do.”\n“But it failed.”\n“Yes. And there’s a part of me that can never forgive Sadeas for that"

And there’s a part of me that can never forgive Sadeas for that\nfailure. I know it’s irrational, but he should have been there, with Gavilar.\nJust like I should have been. We both failed our king, and we cannot forgive\none another. But the two of us are still united in one thing. We made a vow\non that day. We’d protect Gavilar’s son. No matter what the cost, no matter\nwhat other things came between us, we would protect Elhokar.\n“And so that’s why I’m here on these Plains. It isn’t wealth or glory. I\ncare nothing for those things, not any longer. I came for the brother I loved,\nand for the nephew I love in his own right. And, in a way, this is what\ndivides Sadeas and me even as it unites us. Sadeas thinks that the best way\nto protect Elhokar is to kill the Parshendi. He drives himself, and his men,\nbrutally, to get to those plateaus and fight. I believe a part of him thinks I’m\nbreaking my vow by not doing the same.\n“But that’s not the way to protect Elhokar. He needs a stable throne,\nallies that support him, not highprinces that bicker. Making a strong\nAlethkar will protect him better than killing our enemies will. This was\nGavilar’s life’s work, uniting the highprinces…”\nHe trailed off. Adolin waited for more, but it did not come.\n“Sadeas,” Adolin finally said. “I’m…surprised to hear you call him\nbrave.”\n“He is brave. And cunning. Sometimes, I make the mistake of letting\nhis extravagant dress and mannerisms lead me to underestimate him. But\nthere’s a good man inside of him, son. He is not our enemy. We can be petty\nsometimes, the two of us. But he works to protect Elhokar, so I ask you to\nrespect that.”\nHow did one respond to that? You hate him, but you ask me not to?\n“All right,” Adolin said. “I’ll watch myself around him. But, Father, I still\ndon’t trust him. Please. At least consider the possibility that he’s not as\ncommitted as you are, that he’s playing you.”\n“Very well,” Dalinar said. “I’ll consider it.”\nAdolin nodded. It was something. “What of what he said at the end?\nSomething about writing?”\nDalinar hesitated. “It is a secret he and I share. Other than us, only\nJasnah and Elhokar know of it. I’ve contemplated for a time whether I\nshould tell you, as you will take my place should I fall. I spoke to you of the\nlast words my brother said to me.”\n“Asking you to follow the Codes.”\n“Yes. But there is more. Something else he said to me, but not with\nspoken words. Instead, these are words that…he wrote.”\n“Gavilar could write?”\n“When Sadeas discovered the king’s body, he found words written on\nthe fragment of a board, using Gavilar’s own blood. ‘Brother,’ they said."

If it is true that he\ncould write—and other possibilities seem implausible—it was a shameful\nsecret he hide. As I said, his actions grew very odd near the end of his life.”\n“And what does it mean? Those words?”\n“It’s a quote,” Dalinar said. “From an ancient book called The Way of\nKings. Gavilar favored readings from the volume near the end of his life—\nhe spoke to me of it often. I didn’t realize the quote was from it until\nrecently; Jasnah discovered it for me. I’ve now had the text of the book read\nto me a few times, but so far, I find nothing to explain why he wrote what\nhe did.” He paused. “The book was used by the Radiants as a kind of\nguidebook, a book of counsel on how to live their lives.”\nThe Radiants? Stormfather! Adolin thought. The delusions his father\nhad…they often seemed to have something to do with the Radiants. This\nwas further proof that the delusions were related to Dalinar’s guilt over his\nbrother’s death.\nBut what could Adolin do to help?\nMetal footsteps ground on the rock behind. Adolin turned, then nodded\nin respect as the king approached, still wearing his golden Shardplate,\nthough he’d removed the helm. He was several years Adolin’s senior, and\nhad a bold face with a prominent nose. Some said they saw in him a kingly\nair and a regal bearing, and women Adolin trusted had confided that they\nfound the king quite handsome.\nNot as handsome as Adolin, of course. But still handsome.\nThe king was married, however; his wife the queen managed his\naffairs back in Alethkar. “Uncle,” Elhokar said. “Can we not be on our way?\nI’m certain that we Shardbearers could leap the chasm. You and I could be\nback at the warcamps shortly.”\n“I will not leave my men, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “And I doubt\nyou want to be running across the plateaus for several hours alone, exposed,\nwithout proper guards.”\n“I suppose,” the king said. “Either way, I did want to thank you for\nyour bravery today. It appears that I owe you my life yet again.”\n“Keeping you alive is something else I try very hard to make a habit,\nYour Majesty.”\n“I am glad for it. Have you looked into the item I asked you about?”\nHe nodded to the girth, which Adolin realized he was still carrying in a\ngauntleted hand.\n“I did,” Dalinar said.\n“Well?”\n“We couldn’t decide, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said, taking the strap and\nhanding it to the king. “It may have been cut. The tear is smoother along\none side. Like it was weakened so that it would rip.”\n“I knew it!” Elhokar held the strap up and inspected it.\n“We are not leatherworkers, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “We need to"

I have\ninstructed Adolin to look into the matter further.”\n“It was cut,” Elhokar said. “I can see it clearly, right here. I keep\ntelling you, Uncle. Someone is trying to kill me. They want me, just like\nthey wanted my father.”\n“Surely you don’t think the Parshendi did this,” Dalinar said, sounding\nshocked.\n“I don’t know who did it. Perhaps someone on this very hunt.”\nAdolin frowned. What was Elhokar implying? The majority of the\npeople on this hunt were Dalinar’s men.\n“Your Majesty,” Dalinar said frankly, “we will look into the matter.\nBut you have to be prepared to accept that this might have just been an\naccident.”\n“You don’t believe me,” Elhokar said flatly. “You never believe me.”\nDalinar took a deep breath, and Adolin could see that his father had to\nstruggle to keep his temper. “I’m not saying that. Even a potential threat to\nyour life worries me very much. But I do suggest that you avoid leaping to\nconclusions. Adolin has pointed out that this would be a terribly clumsy\nway to try to kill you. A fall from horseback isn’t a serious threat to a man\nwearing Plate.”\n“Yes, but during a hunt?” Elhokar said. “Perhaps they wanted the\nchasmfiend to kill me.”\n“We weren’t supposed to be in danger from the hunt,” Dalinar said.\n“We were supposed to pelt the greatshell from a distance, then ride up and\nbutcher it.”\nElhokar narrowed his eyes, looking at Dalinar, then at Adolin. It was\nalmost as if the king were suspicious of them. The look was gone in a\nsecond. Had Adolin imagined it? Stormfather! he thought.\nFrom behind, Vamah began calling to the king. Elhokar glanced at him\nand nodded. “This isn’t over, Uncle,” he said to Dalinar. “Look into that\nstrap.”\n“I will.”\nThe king handed the strap back, then left, armor clinking.\n“Father,” Adolin said immediately, “did you see—”\n“I’ll speak to him about it,” Dalinar said. “Sometime when he isn’t so\nworked up.”\n“But—”\n“I will speak to him, Adolin. You look into that strap. And go gather\nyour men.” He nodded toward something in the distant west. “I think I see\nthat bridge crew coming.”\nFinally, Adolin thought, following his gaze. A small group of figures\nwas crossing the plateau in the distance, bearing Dalinar’s banner and\nleading a bridge crew carrying one of Sadeas’s mobile bridges. They’d sent\nfor one of those, as they were faster than Dalinar’s larger, chull-pulled\nbridges.\nAdolin hurried off to give the orders, though he found himself\ndistracted by his father’s words, Gavilar’s final message, and now the king’s"

It seemed he would have plenty to preoccupy his mind on\nthe long ride back to the camps.\nDalinar watched Adolin rush away to do as ordered. The lad’s breastplate\nstill bore a web of cracks, though it had stopped leaking Stormlight. With\ntime, the armor would repair itself. It could reform even if it was\ncompletely shattered.\nThe lad liked to complain, but he was as good a son as a man could ask\nfor. Fiercely loyal, with initiative and a strong sense of command. The\nsoldiers liked him. Perhaps he was a little too friendly with them, but that\ncould be forgiven. Even his hotheadedness could be forgiven, assuming he\nlearned to channel it.\nDalinar left the young man to his work and went to check on Gallant.\nHe found the Ryshadium with the grooms, who had set up a horse picket on\nthe southern side of the plateau. They had bandaged the horse’s scrapes, and\nhe was no longer favoring his leg.\nDalinar patted the large stallion on the neck, looking into those deep\nblack eyes. The horse seemed ashamed. “It wasn’t your fault you threw me,\nGallant,” Dalinar said in a soothing voice. “I’m just glad you weren’t\nharmed too badly.” He turned to a nearby groom. “Give him extra feed this\nevening, and two crispmelons.”\n“Yes sir, Brightlord. But he won’t eat extra food. He never does if we\ntry to give it to him.”\n“He’ll eat it tonight,” Dalinar said, patting the Ryshadium’s neck\nagain. “He only eats it when he feels he deserves it, son.”\nThe lad seemed confused. Like most of them, he thought of\nRyshadium as just another breed of horse. A man couldn’t really understand\nuntil he’d had one accept him as rider. It was like wearing Shardplate, an\nexperience that was completely indescribable.\n“You’ll eat both of those crispmelons,” Dalinar said, pointing at the\nhorse. “You deserve them.”\nGallant blustered.\n“You do,” Dalinar said. The horse nickered, seeming content. Dalinar\nchecked the leg, then nodded to the groom. “Take good care of him, son. I’ll\nride another horseback.”\n“Yes, Brightlord.”\nThey got him a mount—a sturdy, dust-colored mare. He was extra\ncareful when he swung into the saddle. Ordinary horses always seemed so\nfragile to him.\nThe king rode out after the first squad of troops, Wit at his side.\nSadeas, Dalinar noted, rode behind, where Wit couldn’t get at him.\nThe bridge crew waited silently, resting as the king and his procession\ncrossed. Like most of Sadeas’s bridge crews, this one was constructed from\na jumble of human refuse. Foreigners, deserters, thieves, murderers, and\nslaves.

How long would it be\nbefore he could no longer fill the bridge crews with the suitably\nexpendable? Did any man, even a murderer, deserve such a fate?\nA passage from The Way of Kings came to Dalinar’s head unbidden.\nHe’d been listening to readings from the book more often than he’d\nrepresented to Adolin.\nI once saw a spindly man carrying a stone larger than his head upon\nhis back, the passage went. He stumbled beneath the weight, shirtless under\nthe sun, wearing only a loincloth. He tottered down a busy thoroughfare.\nPeople made way for him. Not because they sympathized with him, but\nbecause they feared the momentum of his steps. You dare not impede one\nsuch as this.\nThe monarch is like this man, stumbling along, the weight of a\nkingdom on his shoulders. Many give way before him, but so few are willing\nto step in and help carry the stone. They do not wish to attach themselves to\nthe work, lest they condemn themselves to a life full of extra burdens.\nI left my carriage that day and took up the stone, lifting it for the man.\nI believe my guards were embarrassed. One can ignore a poor shirtless\nwretch doing such labor, but none ignore a king sharing the load. Perhaps\nwe should switch places more often. If a king is seen to assume the burden\nof the poorest of men, perhaps there will be those who will help him with his\nown load, so invisible, yet so daunting.\nDalinar was shocked that he could remember the story word for word,\nthough he probably shouldn’t have been. In searching for the meaning\nbehind Gavilar’s last message, he’d listened to readings from the book\nalmost every day of the last few months.\nHe’d been disappointed to find that there was no clear meaning behind\nthe quote Gavilar had left. He’d continued to listen anyway, though he tried\nto keep his interest quiet. The book did not have a good reputation, and not\njust because it was associated with the Lost Radiants. Stories of a king\ndoing the work of a menial laborer were the least of its discomforting\npassages. In other places, it outright said that lighteyes were beneath\ndarkeyes. That contradicted Vorin teachings.\nYes, best to keep this quiet. Dalinar had spoken truly when he’d told\nAdolin he didn’t care what people said about him. But when the rumors\nimpeded his ability to protect Elhokar, they could become dangerous. He\nhad to be careful.\nHe turned his mount and clopped up onto the bridge, then nodded his\nthanks to the bridgemen. They were the lowest in the army, and yet they\nbore the weight of kings.\nSEVEN AND A HALF YEARS AGO\n“He wants to send me to Kharbranth,” Kal said, perched atop his rock. “To\ntrain to become a surgeon.”\n“What, really?” Laral asked, as she walked across the edge of the rock\njust in front of him. She had golden streaks in her otherwise black hair. She\nwore it long, and it streamed out behind her in a gust of wind as she\nbalanced, hands out to the sides."

She\nwore it long, and it streamed out behind her in a gust of wind as she\nbalanced, hands out to the sides.\nThe hair was distinctive. But, of course, her eyes were more so. Bright,\npale green. So different from the browns and blacks of the townspeople.\nThere really was something different about being a lighteyes.\n“Yes, really,” Kal said with a grunt. “He’s been talking about it for a\ncouple of years now.”\n“And you didn’t tell me?”\nKal shrugged. He and Laral were atop a low ridge of boulders to the\neast of Hearthstone. Tien, his younger brother, was picking through rocks at\nthe base. To Kal’s right, a grouping of shallow hillsides rolled to the west.\nThey were sprinkled with lavis polyps, a planting halfway to being\nharvested.\nHe felt oddly sad as he looked over those hillsides, filled with working\nmen. The dark brown polyps would grow like melons filled with grain.\nAfter being dried, that grain would feed the entire town and their\nhighprince’s armies. The ardents who passed through town were careful to\nexplain that the Calling of a farmer was a noble one, one of the highest save\nfor the Calling of a soldier. Kal’s father whispered under his breath that he\nsaw far more honor in feeding the kingdom than he did in fighting and\ndying in useless wars.\n“Kal?” Laral said, voice insistent. “Why didn’t you tell me?”\n“Sorry,” he said. “I wasn’t sure if Father was serious or not. So I didn’t\nsay anything.”\nThat was a lie. He’d known his father was serious. Kal just hadn’t\nwanted to mention leaving to become a surgeon, particularly not to Laral.\nShe placed her hands on her hips. “I thought you were going to go\nbecome a soldier.”\nKal shrugged.\nShe rolled her eyes, hopping down off her ridge onto a stone beside\nhim. “Don’t you want to become a lighteyes? Win a Shardblade?”\n“Father says that doesn’t happen very often.”\nShe knelt down before him. “I’m sure you could do it.” Those eyes, so\nbright and alive, shimmering green, the color of life itself.\nMore and more, Kal found that he liked looking at Laral. Kal knew,\nlogically, what was happening to him. His father had explained the process\nof growing with the precision of a surgeon. But there was so much feeling\ninvolved, emotions that his father’s sterile descriptions hadn’t explained.\nSome of those emotions were about Laral and the other girls of the town.\nOther emotions had to do with the strange blanket of melancholy that\nsmothered him at times when he wasn’t expecting.\n“I…” Kal said.\n“Look,” Laral said, standing up again and climbing atop her rock. Her\nfine yellow dress ruffled in the wind. One more year, and she’d start\nwearing a glove on her left hand, the mark that a girl had entered\nadolescence. “Up, come on. Look.”\nKal hauled himself to his feet, looking eastward. There, snarlbrush\ngrew in dense thickets around the bases of stout markel trees.\n“What do you see?” Laral demanded."

There, snarlbrush\ngrew in dense thickets around the bases of stout markel trees.\n“What do you see?” Laral demanded.\n“Brown snarlbrush. Looks like it’s probably dead.”\n“The Origin is out there,” she said, pointing. “This is the stormlands.\nFather says we’re here to be a windbreak for more timid lands to the west.”\nShe turned to him. “We’ve got a noble heritage, Kal, darkeyes and light-\neyes alike. That’s why the best warriors have always been from Alethkar.\nHighprince Sadeas, General Amaram…King Gavilar himself.”\n“I suppose.”\nShe sighed exaggeratedly. “I hate talking to you when you’re like this,\nyou know.”\n“Like what?”\n“Like you are now. You know. Moping around, sighing.”\n“You’re the one who just sighed, Laral.”\n“You know what I mean.”\nShe stepped down from the rock, walking over to go pout. She did that\nsometimes. Kal stayed where he was, looking eastward. He wasn’t sure how\nhe felt. His father really wanted him to be a surgeon, but he wavered. It\nwasn’t just because of the stories, the excitement and wonder of them. He\nfelt that by being a soldier, he could change things. Really change them. A\npart of him dreamed of going to war, of protecting Alethkar, of fighting\nalongside heroic lighteyes. Of doing good someplace other than a little\ntown that nobody important ever visited.\nHe sat down. Sometimes he dreamed like that. Other times, he found it\nhard to care about anything. His dreary feelings were like a black eel, coiled\ninside of him. The snarlbrush out there survived the storms by growing\ntogether densely about the bases of the mighty markel trees. Their bark was\ncoated with stone, their branches thick as a man’s leg. But now the\nsnarlbrush was dead. It hadn’t survived. Pulling together hadn’t been\nenough for it.\n“Kaladin?” a voice asked from behind him.\nHe turned to find Tien. Tien was ten years old, two years Kal’s junior,\nthough he looked much younger. While other kids called him a runt, Lirin\nsaid that Tien just hadn’t hit his height yet. But, well, with those round,\nflushed cheeks and that slight build, Tien did look like a boy half his age.\n“Kaladin,” he said, eyes wide, hands cupped together. “What are you\nlooking at?”\n“Dead weeds,” Kal said.\n“Oh. Well, you need to see this.”\n“What is it?”\nTien opened his hands to reveal a small stone, weathered on all sides\nbut with a jagged break on the bottom. Kal picked it up, looking it over. He\ncouldn’t see anything distinctive about it at all. In fact, it was dull.\n“It’s just a rock,” Kal said.\n“Not just a rock,” Tien said, taking out his canteen. He wetted his\nthumb, then rubbed it on the flat side of the stone. The wetness darkened the\nstone, and made visible an array of white patterns in the rock. “See?” Tien\nasked, handing it back."

The wetness darkened the\nstone, and made visible an array of white patterns in the rock. “See?” Tien\nasked, handing it back.\nThe strata of the rock alternated white, brown, black. The pattern was\nremarkable. Of course, it was still just a rock. But for some reason, Kal\nfound himself smiling. “That’s nice, Tien.” He moved to hand the rock\nback.\nTien shook his head. “I found it for you. To make you feel better.”\n“I…” It was just a stupid rock. Yet, inexplicably, Kal did feel better.\n“Thanks. Hey, you know what? I’ll bet there’s a lurg or two hiding in these\nrocks somewhere. Want to see if we can find one?”\n“Yes, yes, yes!” Tien said. He laughed and began moving down the\nrocks. Kal moved to follow, but paused, remembering something his father\nhad said.\nHe poured some water on his hand from his own canteen and flung it\nat the brown snarlbrush. Wherever sprayed droplets fell, the brush grew\ninstantly green, as if he were throwing paint. The brush wasn’t dead; it just\ndried out, waiting for the storms to come. Kal watched the patches of green\nslowly fade back to tan as the water was absorbed.\n“Kaladin!” Tien yelled. He often used Kal’s full name, even though\nKal had asked him not to. “Is this one?”\nKal moved down across the boulders, pocketing the rock he’d been\ngiven. As he did so, he passed Laral. She was looking westward, toward her\nfamily’s mansion. Her father was the citylord of Hearthstone. Kal found his\neyes lingering on her again. That hair of hers was beautiful, with the two\nstark colors.\nShe turned to Kal and frowned.\n“We’re going to hunt some lurgs,” he explained, smiling and gesturing\ntoward Tien. “Come on.”\n“You’re cheerful suddenly.”\n“I don’t know. I feel better.”\n“How does he do that? I wonder.”\n“Who does what?”\n“Your brother,” Laral said, looking toward Tien. “He changes you.”\nTien’s head popped up behind some stones and he waved eagerly,\nbouncing up and down with excitement.\n“It’s just hard to be gloomy when he’s around,” Kal said. “Come on.\nDo you want to watch the lurg or not?”\n“I suppose,” Laral said with a sigh. She held out a hand toward him.\n“What’s that for?” Kal asked, looking at her hand.\n“To help me down.”\n“Laral, you’re a better climber than me or Tien. You don’t need help.”\n“It’s polite, stupid,” she said, proffering her hand more insistently. Kal\nsighed and took it, then she proceeded to hop down without even leaning on\nit or needing his help. She, he thought, has been acting very strange lately.\nThe two of them joined Tien, who jumped down into a hollow between\nsome boulders. The younger boy pointed eagerly. A silky patch of white\ngrew in a crevice on the rock. It was made of tiny threads spun together into\na ball about the size of a boy’s fist."

It was made of tiny threads spun together into\na ball about the size of a boy’s fist.\n“I’m right, aren’t I?” Tien asked. “That is one?”\nKal lifted the flask and poured water down the side of the stone onto\nthe patch of white. The threads dissolved in the simulated rainwater, the\ncocoon melting to reveal a small creature with slick brown and green skin.\nThe lurg had six legs that it used to grip the stone, and its eyes were in the\ncenter of its back. It hopped off the stone, searching for insects. Tien\nlaughed, watching it bounce from rock to rock, sticking to the stones. It left\nbehind patches of mucus wherever it landed.\nKal leaned back against the stone, watching his brother, remembering\ndays—not so long ago—when chasing lurgs had been more exciting.\n“So,” Laral said, folding her arms. “What are you going to do? If your\nfather tries to send you to Kharbranth?”\n“I don’t know,” Kal said. “The surgeons won’t take anyone before\ntheir sixteenth Weeping, so I’ve got time to think.” The best surgeons and\nhealers trained in Kharbranth. Everyone knew that. The city was said to\nhave more hospitals than taverns.\n“It sounds like your father is forcing you to do what he wants, not what\nyou want,” Laral said.\n“That’s the way everyone does it,” Kal said, scratching his head. “The\nother boys don’t mind becoming farmers because their fathers were\nfarmers, and Ral just became the new town carpenter. He didn’t mind that it\nwas what his father did. Why should I mind being a surgeon?”\n“I just—” Laral looked angry. “Kal, if you go to war and find a\nShardblade, then you’d be a lighteyes…. I mean…Oh, this is useless.” She\nsettled back, folding her arms even more tightly.\nKal scratched his head. She really was acting oddly. “I wouldn’t mind\ngoing to war, winning honor and all that. Mostly, I’d like to travel. See what\nother lands are like.” He’d heard tales of exotic animals, like enormous\ncrustaceans or eels that sang. Of Rall Elorim, City of Shadows, or Kurth,\nCity of Lightning.\nHe’d spent a lot of time studying these last few years. Kal’s mother\nsaid he should be allowed to have a childhood, rather than focusing so\nmuch on his future. Lirin argued that the tests to be admitted by the\nKharbranthian surgeons were very rigorous. If Kal wanted a chance with\nthem, he’d have to begin learning early.\nAnd yet, to become a soldier…The other boys dreamed of joining the\narmy, of fighting with King Gavilar. There was talk of going to war with Jah\nKeved, once and for all. What would it be like, to finally see some of the\nheroes from stories?

Kal grabbed a small, weathered stone off the\nground, then laid a hand on Tien’s shoulder, stopping the boy from prodding\nthe tired amphibian. Kal moved forward and nudged the lurg with two\nfingers, making it hop off the boulder and onto his stone. He handed this to\nTien, who watched with wide eyes as the lurg spun its cocoon, spitting out\nthe wet silk and using tiny hands to shape it. That cocoon would be\nwatertight from the inside, sealed by dried mucus, but rainwater outside\nwould dissolve the sack.\nKal smiled, then lifted the flask and drank. This was cool, clean water,\nwhich had already had the crem settled out. Crem—the sludgy brown\nmaterial that fell with rainwater—could make a man sick. Everybody knew\nthat, not just surgeons. You always let water sit for a day, then poured off\nthe fresh water on top and used the crem to make pottery.\nThe lurg eventually finished its cocoon. Tien immediately reached for\nthe flask.\nKal held the flask high. “It’ll be tired, Tien. It won’t jump around\nanymore.”\n“Oh.”\nKal lowered the flask, patting his brother’s shoulder. “I put it on that\nstone so you could carry it around. You can get it out later.” He smiled. “Or\nyou could drop it in Father’s bathwater through the window.”\nTien grinned at that prospect. Kal ruffled the boy’s dark hair. “Go see\nif you can find another cocoon. If we catch two, you’ll have one to play\nwith and one to slip into the bathwater.”\nTien carefully set the rock aside, then scampered up over the boulders.\nThe hillside here had broken during a highstorm several months back.\nShattered, as if it had been hit by the fist of some enormous creature. People\nsaid that it could have been a home that got destroyed. They burned prayers\nof thanks to the Almighty while at the same time whispering of dangerous\nthings that moved in the darkness at full storm. Were the Voidbringers\nbehind the destruction, or had it been the shades of the Lost Radiants?\nLaral was looking toward the mansion again. She smoothed her dress\nnervously—lately she took far more care, not getting her clothes dirty as\nshe once had.\n“You still thinking about war?” Kal asked.\n“Um. Yes. I am.”\n“Make sense,” he said. An army had come through recruiting just a\nfew weeks back and had picked up a few of the older boys, though only\nafter Citylord Wistiow had given permission. “What do you think broke the\nrocks here, during the highstorm?”\n“I couldn’t say.”\nKal looked eastward. What sent the storms? His father said no ship had\never sailed for the Origin of Storms and returned safely. Few ships ever\neven left the coast.

        "text": "death, so the stories said.\nHe took another sip from his flask, then capped it, saving the rest in\ncase Tien found another lurg. Distant men worked the fields, wearing\noveralls, laced brown shirts, and sturdy boots. It was worming season. A\nsingle worm could ruin an entire polyp’s worth of grain. It would incubate\ninside, slowly eating as the grain grew. When you finally opened up the\npolyp in the fall, all you’d find was a big fat slug the size of two men’s\nhands. And so they searched in the spring, going over each polyp. Where\nthey found a burrow, they’d stick in a reed tipped with sugar, which the\nworm would latch on to. You pulled it out and squished it under your heel,\nthen patched the hole with crem.\nIt could take weeks to properly worm a field, and farmers usually went\nover their hills three or four times, fertilizing as they went. Kal had heard\nthe process described a hundred times over. You didn’t live in a town like\nHearthstone without listening to men gripe about worms.\nOddly, he noticed a group older boys gathering at the foot of one of the\nhills. He recognized all of them, of course. Jost and Jest, brothers. Mord,\nTift, Naget, Khav, and others. They each had solid, Alethi darkeyes names.\nNot like Kaladin’s own name. It was different.\n“Why aren’t they worming?” he asked.\n“I don’t know,” Laral said, shifting her attention to the boys. She got\nan odd look in her eyes. “Let’s go see.” She started down the hillside before\nKal had a chance to object.\nHe scratched his head, looking toward Tien. “We’re going down to the\nhillside there.”\nA youthful head popped up behind a boulder. Tien nodded\nenergetically, then turned back to his searching. Kal slipped off the boulder\nand walked down the slope after Laral. She reached the boys, and they\nregarded her with uncomfortable expressions. She’d never spent much time\nwith them, not like she had with Kal and Tien. Her father and his were\npretty good friends, for all that one was lighteyed and the other dark.\nLaral took a perch on a nearby rock, waiting and saying nothing. Kal\nwalked up. Why had she wanted to come down here, if she wasn’t going to\ntalk to the other boys?\n“Ho, Jost,” Kal said. Senior among the boys at fourteen, Jost was\nnearly a man—and he looked it too. His chest was broad beyond his years,\nhis legs thick and stocky, like those of his father. He was holding a length of\nwood from a sapling that had been shaved into a rough approximation of a\nquarterstaff. “Why aren’t you worming?”\nIt was the wrong thing to say, and Kal knew it immediately. Several of\nthe boys’ expressions darkened. It was a sore point to them that Kal never\nhad to work the hills. His protests—that he spent hours upon hours\nmemorizing muscles, bones, and cures—fell on uncaring ears. All they saw\nwas a boy who got to spend his days in the shade while they toiled in the\nburning sun."

All they saw\nwas a boy who got to spend his days in the shade while they toiled in the\nburning sun.\n“Old Tarn found a patch of polyps that ain’t growing right,” Jost finally\nsaid, shooting a glance at Laral. “Let us go for the day while they talked\nover whether to try another planting there, or just let them grow and see\nwhat comes of it.”\nKal nodded, feeling awkward as he stood before the nine boys. They\nwere sweaty, the knees of their trousers stained with crem and patched from\nrubbing stone. But Kal was clean, wearing a fine pair of trousers his mother\nhad purchased just a few weeks before. His father had sent him and Tien out\nfor the day while he tended to something at the citylord’s manor. Kal would\npay for the break with late-night studying by Stormlight, but no use\nexplaining that to the other boys.\n“So, er,” Kal said, “what were you all talking about?”\nRather than answering, Naget said, “Kal, you know things.” Light\nhaired and spindly, he was the tallest of the bunch. “Don’t you? About the\nworld and the like?”\n“Yeah,” Kal said, scratching his head. “Sometimes.”\n“You ever heard of a darkeyes becoming a lighteyes?” Naget asked.\n“Sure,” Kal said. “It can happen, Father says. Wealthy darkeyed\nmerchants marry lowborn lighteyes and join their family. Then maybe have\nlighteyed children. That sort of thing.”\n“No, not like that,” Khav said. He had low eyebrows and always\nseemed to have a perpetual scowl on his face. “You know. Real darkeyes.\nLike us.”\nNot like you, the tone seemed to imply. Kal’s family were the only one\nof second nahn in the town. Everyone else was fourth or fifth, and Kal’s\nrank made them uncomfortable around him. His father’s strange profession\ndidn’t help either.\nIt all left Kal feeling distinctly out-of-place.\n“You know how it can happen,” Kal said. “Ask Laral. She was just\ntalking about it. If a man wins a Shardblade on the battlefield, his eyes\nbecome light.”\n“That’s right,” Laral said. “Everybody knows it. Even a slave could\nbecome a lighteyes if he won a Shardblade.”\nThe boys nodded; they all had brown, black, or other dark-colored\neyes. Winning a Shardblade was one of the main reasons common men\nwent to war. In Vorin kingdoms, everyone had a chance to rise. It was, as\nKal’s father would say, a fundamental tenet of their society.\n“Yeah,” Naget said impatiently. “But have you ever heard of it\nhappening? Not just in stories, I mean. Does it happen for real?”\n“Sure,” Kal said. “It must. Otherwise, why would so many men go to\nwar?”\n“Because,” Jest said, “we’ve gotta prepare men to fight for the\nTranquiline Halls. We’ve gotta send soldiers to the Heralds. The ardents are\nalways talking of it.”\n“In the same breaths that they tell us it’s all right to be a farmer too,”"

Told the\nofficer that he’d been the one to kill the Shardbearer, so he got the Blade,\nand my fah—”\nHe was cut off by Laral’s tinkling laughter. Kal frowned. That was a\ndifferent kind of laughter than he normally heard from her, much more\nsubdued and kind of annoying. “Jost, you’re claiming your father won a\nShardblade?” she said.\n“No. It was taken from him,” the larger boy said.\n“Didn’t your father fight in the wastescum skirmishes up north?” Laral\nsaid. “Tell him, Kaladin.”\n“She’s right, Jost. There weren’t any Shardbearers there—just Reshi\nraiders who thought they’d take advantage of the new king. They’ve never\nhad any Shardblades. If your father saw one, he must be remembering\nincorrectly.”\n“Remembering incorrectly?” Jost said.\n“Er, sure,” Kal said quickly. “I’m not saying he’s lying, Jost. He just\nmight have some trauma-induced hallucinations, or something like that.”\nThe boys grew silent, looking at Kal. One scratched his head.\nJost spat to the side. He seemed to be watching Laral from the corner\nof his eye. She pointedly looked at Kal and smiled at him.\n“You always got to make a man feel like an idiot, don’t you, Kal?” Jost\nsaid.\n“What? No, I—”\n“You want to make my fah sound like a fool,” Jost said, face red. “And\nyou want to make me sound stupid. Well, some of us ain’t lucky enough to\nspend our days eating fruit and laying about. We’ve got to work.”\n“I don’t—”\nJost tossed the quarterstaff to Kal. He caught it awkwardly. Then Jost\ntook the other staff from his brother. “You insult my fah, you get a fight.\nThat’s honor. You have honor, lordling?”\n“I’m no lordling,” Kal spat. “Stormfather, Jost, I’m only a few nahn\nhigher than you are.”\nJost’s eyes grew angrier at the mention of nahn. He held up his\nquarterstaff. “You going to fight me or not?” Angerspren began to appear in\nsmall pools at his feet, bright red.\nKal knew what Jost was doing.

Kal’s father said it\nhad to do with their insecurity. He’d have told Kal to just drop the\nquarterstaff and walk away.\nBut Laral was sitting right there, smiling at him. And men didn’t\nbecome heroes by walking away. “All right. Sure.” Kal held up his\nquarterstaff.\nJost swung immediately, more quickly than Kal had anticipated. The\nother boys watched with a mixture of glee, shock, and amazement. Kal\nbarely managed to get his staff up. The lengths of wood cracked together,\nsending a jolt up Kal’s arms.\nKal was knocked off balance. Jost moved quickly, stepping to the side\nand swinging his staff down and hitting Kal in the foot. Kal cried out as a\nflash of agony lanced up his leg, and he released the staff with one hand and\nreached down.\nJost swung his staff around and hit Kal’s side. Kal gasped, letting the\nstaff clatter to the stones and grabbing his side as he fell to his knees. He\nbreathed out in huffing breaths, straining against the pain. Small, spindly\npainspren—glowing pale orange hand shapes, like stretching sinew or\nmuscles—crawled from the stone around him.\nKal dropped one hand to the stones, leaning forward as he held his\nside. You’d better not have broken any of my ribs, you cremling, he thought.\nTo the side, Laral pursed her lips. Kal felt a sudden, overpowering\nshame.\nJost lowered his staff, looking abashed. “Well,” he said. “You can see\nthat my fah trained me right good. Maybe that will show you. The things he\nsays are true, and—”\nKal growled in anger and pain, snatching his quarterstaff from the\nground and leaping at Jost. The older boy cursed, stumbling backward as he\nraised his weapon. Kal bellowed, slamming his weapon forward.\nSomething changed in that moment. Kal felt an energy as he held the\nweapon, an excitement that washed away his pain. He spun, smashing the\nstaff into one of Jost’s hands.\nJost let go with that hand, screaming. Kal brought his weapon around\nand slammed it into the boy’s side. Kal had never held a weapon before,\nnever been in a fight any more dangerous than a wrestling match with Tien.\nBut the length of wood felt right in his fingers. He was amazed by how\nwonderful the moment felt.\nJost grunted, stumbling again, and Kal brought his weapon back\naround, preparing to smash Jost’s face. He raised his staff, but then froze.\nJost was bleeding from the hand Kal had hit. Just a little, but it was blood.\nHe’d hurt someone.\nJost growled and lurched upright. Before Kal could protest, the larger\nboy swept Kal’s legs from underneath him, sending him to the ground,\nknocking the breath from his lungs. That set afire the wound in his side, and\nthe painspren scampered across the ground, latching on to Kal’s side,\nlooking like an orange scar as they fed on Kal’s agony."

He didn’t know what\nto feel. Holding the staff in that moment had felt wonderful. Incredible. At\nthe same time, he could see Laral to the side. She stood up and, instead of\nkneeling to help him, turned and walked away, toward her father’s mansion.\nTears welled in Kal’s eyes. With a shout, he rolled over and grabbed\nthe quarterstaff again. He would not give in!\n“None of that now,” Jost said from behind. Kal felt something hard on\nhis back, a boot shoving him down to the stone. Jest took the staff from\nKal’s fingers.\nI failed. I…lost. He hated the feeling, hated it far more than the pain.\n“You did well,” Jost said grudgingly. “But leave off. I don’t want to\nhave to hurt you for real.”\nKal bowed his head down, letting his forehead rest on the warm, sunlit\nrock. Jost removed his foot, and the boys withdrew, chatting, their boots\nscraping on rock. Kal forced himself to his hands and knees, then up onto\nhis feet.\nJost turned back, wary, holding his quarterstaff in one hand.\n“Teach me,” Kal said.\nJost blinked in surprise. He glanced at his brother.\n“Teach me,” Kal pled, stepping forward. “I’ll worm for you, Jost. My\nfather gives me two hours off each afternoon. I’ll do your work then if\nyou’ll teach me, in the evenings, what your father is teaching you with that\nstaff.”\nHe had to know. Had to feel the weapon in his hands again. Had to see\nif that moment he’d felt had been a fluke. Jost considered, then finally\nshook his head. “Can’t. Your fah would kill me. Get those surgeon’s hands\nof yours all covered with calluses? Wouldn’t be right.” He turned away.\n“You go be what you are, Kal. I’ll be what I am.”\nKal stood for a long while, watching them go. He sat down on the\nrock. Laral’s figure was growing distant. There were some servants coming\ndown the hillside to fetch her. Should he chase after her? His side still hurt,\nand he was annoyed at her for leading him down to the others in the first\nplace. And, above all, he was still embarrassed.\nHe lay back down, emotions welling inside of him. He had trouble\nsorting through them.\n“Kaladin?”\nHe turned, ashamed to find tears in his eyes, and saw Tien sitting on\nthe ground behind him. “How long have you been there?” Kal snapped.\nTien smiled, then set a rock on the ground. He climbed to his feet and\nhurried away, not stopping when Kal called after him. Grumbling, Kal\nforced himself to his feet and walked over to pick up the rock.\nIt was another dull, ordinary stone. Tien had a habit of finding those\nand thinking they were incredibly precious. He had an entire collection of\nthem back in the house. He knew where he’d found each one, and could tell\nyou what was special about it."

He knew where he’d found each one, and could tell\nyou what was special about it.\nWith a sigh, Kal began walking back toward the town.\nYou go be what you are. I’ll be what I am.\nHis side smarted. Why hadn’t he hit Jost when he’d had the chance?\nCould he train himself out of freezing in battle like that? He could learn to\nhurt. Couldn’t he?\nDid he want to?\nYou go be what you are.\nWhat did a man do if he didn’t know what he was? Or even what he\nwanted to be?\nEventually, he reached Hearthstone proper. The hundred or so\nbuildings were set in rows, each one shaped like a wedge with the low side\npointing stormward. The roofs were of thick wood, tarred to seal out the\nrain. The northern and southern sides of the buildings rarely had windows,\nbut the fronts—facing west away from the storms—were nearly all window.\nLike the plants of the stormlands, the lives of men here were dominated by\nthe highstorms.\nKal’s home was near the outskirts. It was larger than most, built wide\nto accommodate the surgery room, which had its own entrance. The door\nwas ajar, so Kal peeked in. He’d expected to see his mother cleaning, but\ninstead found that his father had returned from Brightlord Wistiow’s manor.\nLirin sat on the edge of the operating table, hands in his lap, bald head\nbowed. He held his spectacles in his hand, and he looked exhausted.\n“Father?” Kal asked. “Why are you sitting in the dark?”\nLirin looked up. His face was somber, distant.\n“Father?” Kal asked, growing more concerned.\n“Brightlord Wistiow has been carried by the winds.”\n“He’s dead?” Kal was so shocked he forgot his side. Wistiow had\nalways been there. He couldn’t be gone. What of Laral? “He was healthy\njust last week!”\n“He has always been frail, Kal,” Lirin said. “The Almighty calls all\nmen back to the Spiritual Realm eventually.”\n“You didn’t do anything?” Kal blurted out; he regretted the words\nimmediately.\n“I did all I could,” his father said, rising. “Perhaps a man with more\ntraining than I…Well, there is no use in regrets.” He walked to the side of\nthe room, removing the black covering from the goblet lamp filled with\ndiamond spheres. It lit the room immediately, blazing like a tiny sun.\n“We have no citylord then,” Kal said, raising a hand to his head. “He\nhad no son….”\n“Those in Kholinar will appoint us a new citylord,” Lirin said.\n“Almighty send them wisdom in the choice.” He looked at the goblet lamp.\nThose were the citylord’s spheres. A small fortune.\nKal’s father put the covering right back on the goblet, as if he hadn’t\njust removed it. The motion plunged the room back into darkness, and Kal\nblinked as his eyes adjusted.\n“He left these to us,” Kal’s father said.\nKal started. “What?”\n“You’re to be sent to Kharbranth when you turn sixteen. These spheres"

These spheres\nwill pay your way—Brightlord Wistiow requested it be done, a last act to\ncare for his people. You will go and become a true master surgeon, then\nreturn to Hearthstone.”\nIn that moment, Kal knew his fate had been sealed. If Brightlord\nWistiow had demanded it, Kal would go to Kharbranth. He turned and\nwalked from the surgery room, passing out into the sunlight, not saying\nanother word to his father.\nHe sat down on the steps. What did he want? He didn’t know. That\nwas the problem. Glory, honor, the things Laral had said…none of those\nreally mattered to him. But there had been something there when he’d held\nthe quarterstaff. And now, suddenly, the decision had been taken from him.\nThe rocks Tien had given him were still in his pocket. He pulled them\nout, then took his canteen off his belt and washed them with water. The first\none he’d been given showed the white swirls and strata. It appeared the\nother one had a hidden design too.\nIt looked like a face, smiling at him, made of white bits in the rock.\nKal smiled despite himself, though it quickly faded. A rock wasn’t going to\nsolve his problems.\nUnfortunately, though he sat for a long while thinking, it didn’t look\nlike anything would solve his problems. He wasn’t sure he wanted to be a\nsurgeon, and he felt suddenly constricted by what life was forcing him to\nbecome.\nBut that one moment holding the quarterstaff sang to him. A single\nmoment of clarity in an otherwise confusing world.\nMight I be quite frank? Before, you asked why I was so concerned. It is\nfor the following reason:\n“He’s old,” Syl said with awe, flitting around the apothecary. “Really old. I\ndidn’t know men got this old. You sure he’s not decayspren wearing a man’s\nskin?”\nKaladin smiled as the apothecary shuffled forward with his cane,\noblivious of the invisible windspren. His face was as full of chasms as the\nShattered Plains themselves, weaving out in a pattern from his deeply\nrecessed eyes. He wore a pair of thick spectacles on the tip of his nose, and\nwas dressed in dark robes.\nKaladin’s father had told him of apothecaries—men who walked the\nline between herbalists and surgeons. Common people regarded the healing\narts with enough superstition that it was easy for an apothecary to cultivate\nan arcane air. The wooden walls were draped with cloth glyphwards styled\nin cryptic patterns, and behind the counter were shelves with rows of jars. A\nfull human skeleton hung in the far corner, held together by wires. The\nwindowless room was lit with bundles of garnet spheres hanging from the\ncorners.\nDespite all that, the place was clean and tidy. It had the familiar scent\nof antiseptic Kaladin associated with his father’s surgery.\n“Ah, young bridgeman.” The short apothecary adjusted his spectacles.\nHe stooped forward, running his fingers through his wispy white beard."

Or maybe a young washwoman\nin the camp has caught your eye? I have a potion which, if slipped into her\ndrink, will make her regard you with favor.”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow.\nSyl, however, opened her mouth in an amazed expression. “You should\ngive that to Gaz, Kaladin. It would be nice if he liked you more.”\nI doubt that’s what it’s intended for, Kaladin thought with a smile.\n“Young bridgeman?” the apothecary asked. “Is it a charm against evil\nyou desire?”\nKaladin’s father had spoken of these things. Many apothecaries\npurveyed supposed love charms or potions to cure all manner of ailments.\nThey’d contain nothing more than some sugar and a few pinches of\ncommon herbs to give a spike of alertness or drowsiness, depending on the\npurported effect. It was all nonsense, though Kaladin’s mother had put great\nstock in glyphwards. Kaladin’s father had always expressed disappointment\nin her stubborn way of clinging to “superstitions.”\n“I need some bandages,” Kaladin said. “And a flask of lister’s oil or\nknobweed sap. Also, a needle and gut, if you have any.”\nThe apothecary’s eyes opened wide in surprise.\n“I’m the son of a surgeon,” Kaladin admitted. “Trained by his hand.\nHe was trained by a man who had studied in the Great Concourse of\nKharbranth.”\n“Ah,” the apothecary said. “Well.” He stood up straighter, setting aside\nhis cane and brushing his robes. “Bandages, you said? And some antiseptic?\nLet me see….” He moved back behind the counter.\nKaladin blinked. The man’s age hadn’t changed, but he didn’t seem\nnearly as frail. His step was firmer, and his voice had lost its whispering\nraspiness. He searched through his bottles, mumbling to himself as he read\noff his labels. “You could just go to the surgeon’s hall. They would charge\nyou far less.”\n“Not for a bridgeman,” Kaladin said, grimacing. He’d been turned\naway. The supplies there were for real soldiers.\n“I see,” the apothecary said, setting a jar on the counter, then bending\ndown to poke in some drawers.\nSyl flitted over to Kaladin. “Every time he bends I think he’ll snap like\na twig.” She was growing able to understand abstract thought, and at a\nsurprisingly rapid pace.\nI know what death is…. He still wasn’t certain whether to feel sorry for\nher or not.\nKaladin picked up the small bottle and undid the cork, smelling what\nwas inside. “Larmic mucus?” He grimaced at the foul smell. “That’s not\nnearly as effective as the two I asked for.”\n“But it’s far cheaper,” the old man said, coming up with a large box.\nHe opened the lid, revealing sterile white bandages. “And you, as has been\nnoted, are a bridgeman.”"

It can’t be that rare.”\n“And do you know how much sap comes from a single plant?” the\napothecary asked, pointing.\nKaladin hesitated. It wasn’t true sap, but a milky substance that you\ncould squeeze from the stalks. Or so his father had said. “No,” Kaladin\nadmitted.\n“A single drop,” the man said. “If you’re lucky. It’s cheaper than\nlister’s oil, sure, but more expensive than the mucus. Even if the mucus\ndoes stink like the Nightwatcher’s own backside.”\n“I don’t have that much,” Kaladin said. It was five diamond marks to a\ngarnet. Ten days’ pay to buy one small jar of antiseptic. Stormfather!\nThe apothecary sniffed. “The needle and gut will cost two clearmarks.\nCan you afford that, at least?”\n“Barely. How much for the bandages? Two full emeralds?”\n“They’re just old scraps that I bleached and boiled. Two clearchips an\narm length.”\n“I’ll give a mark for the box.”\n“Very well.” Kaladin reached into his pocket to get the spheres as the\nold apothecary continued, “You surgeons, all the same. Never give a blink\nto consider where your supplies come from. You just use them like there\nwill be no end.”\n“You can’t put a price on a person’s life,” Kaladin said. One of his\nfather’s sayings. It was the main reason that Lirin had never charged for his\nservices.\nKaladin brought out his four marks. He hesitated when he saw them,\nhowever. Only one was still glowing with its soft crystal light. The other\nthree were dull, the bits of diamond barely visible at the center of the drops\nof glass.\n“Here now,” the apothecary said, squinting. “You trying to pass dun\nspheres off on me?” He snatched one before Kaladin could complain, then\nfished around under his counter. He brought up a jeweler’s loupe, removing\nhis spectacles and holding the sphere up toward the light. “Ah. No, that’s a\nreal gemstone. You should get your spheres infused, bridgeman. Not\neveryone is as trusting as I am.”\n“They were glowing this morning,” Kaladin protested. “Gaz must have\npaid me with run-down spheres.”\nThe apothecary removed his loupe and replaced the spectacles. He\nselected three marks, including the glowing one.\n“Could I have that one?” Kaladin asked.\nThe apothecary frowned.\n“Always keep a glowing sphere in your pocket,” Kaladin said. “It’s\ngood luck.”\n“You certain you don’t want a love potion?”"

A dun sphere was\nworth just as much as an infused one; all you had to do was leave it out in a\nhighstorm, and it would recharge and give off light for a week or so.\nKaladin pocketed the infused sphere and picked up his purchase. He\nnodded farewell to the apothecary, and Syl joined him as he stepped out\ninto the camp’s street.\nHe’d spent some of the afternoon listening to soldiers at the mess hall,\nand he’d learned some things about the warcamps. Things he should have\nlearned weeks ago, but had been too despondent to care about. He now\nknew about the chrysalises on the plateaus, the gemhearts they contained,\nand the competition between the highprinces. He understood why Sadeas\npushed his men so hard, and he was beginning to see why Sadeas turned\naround if they got to the plateau later than another army. That wasn’t very\ncommon. More often, Sadeas arrived first, and the other Alethi armies that\ncame up behind them had to turn back.\nThe warcamps were enormous. All told, there were over a hundred\nthousand troops in the various Alethi camps, many times the population of\nHearthstone. And that wasn’t counting the civilians. A mobile warcamp\nattracted a large array of camp followers; stationary warcamps like these on\nthe Shattered Plains brought even more.\nEach of the ten warcamps filled its own crater, and was filled with an\nincongruous mix of Soulcast buildings, shanties, and tents. Some\nmerchants, like the apothecary, had the money to build a wooden structure.\nThose who lived in tents took them down for storms, then paid for shelter\nelsewhere. Even within the crater, the stormwinds were strong, particularly\nwhere the outer wall was low or broken. Some places—like the lumberyard\n—were completely exposed.\nThe street bustled with the usual crowd. Women in skirts and blouses\n—the wives, sisters, or daughters of the soldiers, merchants, or craftsmen.\nWorkers in trousers or overalls. A large number of soldiers in leathers,\ncarrying spear and shield. All were Sadeas’s men. Soldiers of one camp\ndidn’t mix with those of another, and you stayed away from another\nbrightlord’s crater unless you had business there.\nKaladin shook his head in dismay.\n“What?” Syl asked, settling on his shoulder.\n“I hadn’t expected there to be so much discord among the camps here.\nI thought it would all be one king’s army, unified.”\n“People are discord,” Syl said.\n“What does that mean?”\n“You all act differently and think differently. Nothing else is like that\n—animals act alike, and all spren are, in a sense, virtually the same"

Nothing else is like that\n—animals act alike, and all spren are, in a sense, virtually the same\nindividual. There’s harmony in that. But not in you—it seems that no two of\nyou can agree on anything. All the world does as it is supposed to, except\nfor humans. Maybe that’s why you so often want to kill each other.”\n“But not all windspren act alike,” Kaladin said, opening the box and\ntucking some of the bandages into the pocket he’d sewn into the inside of\nhis leather vest. “You’re proof of that.”\n“I know,” she said softly. “Maybe now you can see why it bothers me\nso.”\nKaladin didn’t know how to respond to that. Eventually, he reached the\nlumberyard. A few members of Bridge Four lounged in the shade on the\neast side of their barrack. It would be interesting to see one of those\nbarracks get made—they were Soulcast directly from air into stone.\nUnfortunately, Soulcastings happened at night, and under strict guard to\nkeep the holy rite from being witnessed by anyone other than ardents or\nvery high-ranking lighteyes.\nThe first afternoon bell sounded right as Kaladin reached the barrack,\nand he caught a glare from Gaz for nearly being late for bridge duty. Most\nof that “duty” would be spent sitting around, waiting for the horns to blow.\nWell, Kaladin didn’t intend to waste time. He couldn’t risk tiring himself by\ncarrying the plank, not when a bridge run could be imminent, but perhaps\nhe could do some stretches or—\nA horn sounded in the air, crisp and clean. It was like the mythical\nhorn that was said to guide the souls of the brave to heaven’s battlefield.\nKaladin froze. As always, he waited for the second blast, an irrational part\nof him needing to hear confirmation. It came, sounding a pattern indicating\nthe location of the pupating chasmfiend.\nSoldiers began to scramble toward the staging area beside the\nlumberyard; others ran into camp to fetch their gear. “Line up!” Kaladin\nshouted, dashing up to the bridgemen. “Storm you! Every man in a line!”\nThey ignored him. Some of the men weren’t wearing their vests, and\nthey clogged the barrack doorway, all trying to get in. Those who had their\nvests ran for the bridge. Kaladin followed, frustrated. Once there, the men\ngathered around the bridge in a carefully prearranged manner. Each man got\na chance to be in the best position: running in front up to the chasm, then\nmoving to the relative safety of the back for the final approach.\nThere was a strict rotation, and errors were neither made nor tolerated.\nBridge crews had a brutal system of self-management: If a man tried to\ncheat, the others forced him to run the final approach in front. That sort of\nthing was supposed to be forbidden, but Gaz turned a blind eye toward\ncheaters. He also refused bribes to let men change positions. Perhaps he\nknew that the only stability—the only hope—the bridgemen had was in\ntheir rotation. Life wasn’t fair, being a bridgeman wasn’t fair, but at least if"

Life wasn’t fair, being a bridgeman wasn’t fair, but at least if\nyou ran the deathline and survived, the next time you got to run at the back.\nThere was one exception. As bridgeleader, Kaladin got to run in the\nfront most of the way, then move to the back for the assault. His was the\nsafest position in the group, though no bridgeman was truly safe. Kaladin\nwas like a moldy crust on a starving man’s plate; not the first bite, but still\ndoomed.\nHe got into position. Yake, Dunny, and Malop were the last stragglers.\nOnce they’d taken their places, Kaladin commanded the men to lift. He was\nhalf surprised to be obeyed, but there was almost always a bridgeleader to\ngive commands during a run. The voice changed, but the simple orders did\nnot. Lift, run, lower.\nTwenty bridges charged down from the lumberyard and toward the\nShattered Plains. Kaladin noticed a group of bridgemen from Bridge Seven\nwatching with relief. They’d been on duty until the first afternoon bell;\nthey’d avoided this run by mere moments.\nThe bridgemen worked hard. It wasn’t just because of threats of\nbeatings—they ran so hard because they wanted to arrive at the target\nplateau before the Parshendi did. If they did so, there would be no arrows,\nno death. And so running their bridges was the one thing the bridgemen did\nwithout reservation or laziness. Though many hated their lives, they still\nclung to them with white-knuckled fervor.\nThey clomped across the first of the permanent bridges. Kaladin’s\nmuscles groaned in protest at being worked again so soon, but he tried not\nto dwell on his fatigue. The highstorm’s rains from the night before meant\nthat most plants were still open, rockbuds spewing out vines, flowering\nbranzahs reaching clawlike branches out of crevices toward the sky. There\nwere also occasional prickletacs: the needly, stone-limbed little shrubs\nKaladin had noticed his first time through the area. Water pooled in the\nnumerous crevices and depressions on the surface of the uneven plateau.\nGaz called out directions, telling them which pathway to take. Many of\nthe nearby plateaus had three or four bridges, creating branching paths\nacross the Plains. The running became rote. It was exhausting, but it was\nalso familiar, and it was nice to be at the front, where he could see where he\nwas going. Kaladin fell into his usual step-counting mantra, as he’d been\nadvised to do by that nameless bridgeman whose sandals he still wore.\nEventually, they reached the last of the permanent bridges. They\ncrossed a short plateau, passing the smoldering ruins of a bridge the\nParshendi had destroyed during the night. How had the Parshendi managed\nthat, during a highstorm? Earlier, while listening to the soldiers, he’d\nlearned that the soldiers regarded the Parshendi with hatred, anger, and not\na little awe.

That still struck Kaladin as incongruous. Parshmen? Fighting? It was\njust so strange.\nBridge Four and the other crews got their bridges down, spanning a\nchasm where it was narrowest. His men collapsed to the ground around\ntheir bridge, relaxing while the army crossed. Kaladin nearly joined them—\nin fact, his knees nearly buckled in anticipation.\nNo, he thought, steadying himself. No. I stand.\nIt was a foolish gesture. The other bridgemen barely paid him any\nheed. One man, Moash, even swore at him. But now that Kaladin had made\nthe decision, he stubbornly stuck to it, clasping his hands behind his back\nand falling into parade rest while watching the army cross.\n“Ho, little bridgeman!” a soldier called from among those waiting their\nturn. “Curious at what real soldiers look like?”\nKaladin turned toward the man, a solid, brown-eyed fellow with arms\nthe size of many men’s thighs. He was a squadleader, by the knots on the\nshoulder of his leather jerkin. Kaladin had borne those knots once.\n“How do you treat your spear and shield, squadleader?” Kaladin called\nback.\nThe man frowned, but Kaladin knew what he was thinking. A soldier’s\ngear was his life; you cared for your weapon as you’d care for your\nchildren, often seeing to its upkeep before you took food or rest.\nKaladin nodded to the bridge. “This is my bridge,” he said in a loud\nvoice. “It is my weapon, the only one allowed me. Treat her well.”\n“Or you’ll do what?” called one of the other soldiers, prompting\nlaughter among the ranks. The squadleader said nothing. He looked\ntroubled.\nKaladin’s words were bravado. In truth, he hated the bridge. Still, he\nremained standing.\nA few moments later, Highprince Sadeas himself crossed on Kaladin’s\nbridge. Brightlord Amaram had always seemed so heroic, so distinguished.\nA gentleman general. This Sadeas was a different creature entirely, with that\nround face, curly hair, and lofty expression. He rode as if he were in a\nparade, one hand lightly holding the reins before him, the other carrying his\nhelm under his arm. His armor was painted red, and the helm bore frivolous\ntassels. There was so much pointless pomp that it nearly overshadowed the\nwonder of the ancient artifact.\nKaladin forgot his fatigue and formed his hands into fists. Here was a\nlighteyes he could hate even more than most, a man so callous that he threw\naway the lives of hundreds of bridgemen each month. A man who had\nexpressly forbidden his bridgemen to have shields for reasons Kaladin still\ndidn’t understand.\nSadeas and his honor guard soon passed, and Kaladin realized that he\nprobably should have bowed. Sadeas hadn’t noticed, but it could have made\ntrouble if he had.

At\neach crossing, he refused to lie down. He stood with hands behind his back,\nwatching the army pass. More soldiers took note of him, jeering. Kaladin\nignored them, and by the fifth or sixth crossing, the jeers faded. The one\nother time he saw Brightlord Sadeas, Kaladin gave a bow, though it made\nhis stomach twist to do so. He did not serve this man. He did not give this\nman allegiance. But he did serve his men of Bridge Four. He would save\nthem, and that meant he had to keep himself from being punished for\ninsolence.\n“Reverse runners!” Gaz called. “Cross and reverse!”\nKaladin turned sharply. The next crossing would be the assault. He\nsquinted, looking into the distance, and could just barely make out a line of\ndark figures gathering on another plateau. The Parshendi had arrived and\nwere forming up. Behind them, a group worked on breaking open the\nchrysalis.\nKaladin felt a spike of frustration. Their speed hadn’t been enough.\nAnd—tired though they were—Sadeas would want to attack quickly, before\nthe Parshendi could get the gemheart out of its shell.\nThe bridgemen rose from their rest, silent, haunted. They knew what\nwas coming. They crossed the chasm and pulled the bridge over, then\nrearranged themselves in reverse order. The soldiers formed ranks. It was\nall so silent, like men preparing to carry a casket to the pyre.\nThe bridgemen left a space for Kaladin at the back, sheltered and\nprotected. Syl alighted on the bridge, looking at the spot. Kaladin walked up\nto it, so tired, mentally and physically. He’d pushed himself too hard in the\nmorning, then again by standing instead of resting. What had possessed him\nto do such a thing? He could barely walk.\nHe looked over the bridgemen. His men were resigned, despondent,\nterrified. If they refused to run, they’d be executed. If they did run, they’d\nface the arrows. They didn’t look toward the distant line of Parshendi\narchers. Instead, they looked down.\nThey are your men, Kaladin told himself. They need you to lead them,\neven if they don’t know it.\nHow can you lead from the rear?\nHe stepped out of line and rounded the bridge; two of the men—Drehy\nand Teft—looked up in shock as he passed. The deathpoint—the spot in the\nvery center of the front—was being held by Rock, the beefy, tan-skinned\nHorneater. Kaladin tapped him on the shoulder. “You’re in my spot, Rock.”\nThe man glanced at him, surprised. “But—”\n“To the back with you.”\nRock frowned. Nobody ever tried to jump ahead in the order. “You’re\nairsick, lowlander,” he said with his thick accent. “You wish to die? Why do\nyou not just go leap into the chasm? That would be easier.”"

It’s my privilege to run at the front. Go.”\nRock shrugged, but did as ordered, taking Kaladin’s position at the\nback. Nobody said a word. If Kaladin wanted to get himself killed, who\nwere they to complain?\nKaladin looked over the bridgemen. “The longer we take to get this\nbridge down, the more arrows they can loose at us. Stay firm, stay\ndetermined, and be quick. Raise bridge!”\nThe men lifted, inner rows moving underneath and situating\nthemselves in rows of five across. Kaladin stood at the very front with a tall,\nstout man named Leyten to his left, a spindly man named Murk to his right.\nAdis and Corl were at the edges. Five men in front. The deathline.\nOnce all of the crews had their bridges up, Gaz gave the command.\n“Assault!”\nThey ran, dashing alongside the standing ranks of the army, passing\nsoldiers holding spears and shields. Some watched with curiosity, perhaps\namused at the sight of the lowly bridgemen running so urgently to their\ndeaths. Others looked away, perhaps ashamed of the lives it would cost to\nget them across that chasm.\nKaladin kept his eyes forward, squelching that incredulous voice in the\nback of his mind, one that screamed he was doing something very stupid.\nHe barreled toward the final chasm, focused on the Parshendi line. Figures\nwith black and crimson skin holding bows.\nSyl flitted close to Kaladin’s head, no longer in the form of a person,\nstreaking like a ribbon of light. She zipped in front of him.\nThe bows came up. Kaladin hadn’t been at the deathpoint during a\ncharge this bad since his first day on the crew. They always put new men\ninto rotation at the deathpoint. That way, if they died, you didn’t have to\nworry about training them.\nThe Parshendi archers drew, aiming at five or six of the bridge crews.\nBridge Four was obviously in their sights.\nThe bows loosed.\n“Tien!” Kaladin screamed, nearly mad with fatigue and frustration. He\nbellowed the name aloud—uncertain why—as a wall of arrows zipped\ntoward him. Kaladin felt a jolt of energy, a surge of sudden strength,\nunanticipated and unexplained.\nThe arrows landed.\nMurk fell without a sound, four or five arrows striking him, spraying\nhis blood across the stones. Leyten dropped as well, and with him both Adis\nand Corl. Shafts struck the ground at Kaladin’s feet, shattering, and a good\nhalf dozen hit the wood around Kaladin’s head and hands.\nKaladin didn’t know if he’d been hit. He was too flush with energy and\nalarm. He continued running, screaming, holding the bridge on his\nshoulders. For some reason, a group of Parshendi archers ahead lowered\ntheir bows. He saw their marbled skin, strange reddish or orange helms, and\nsimple brown clothing. They appeared confused.\nWhatever the reason, it gained Bridge Four a few precious moments."

They appeared confused.\nWhatever the reason, it gained Bridge Four a few precious moments.\nBy the time the Parshendi raised their bows again, Kaladin’s team had\nreached the chasm. His men fell into line with the other bridge crews—\nthere were only fifteen bridges now. Five had fallen. They closed the gaps\nas they arrived.\nKaladin screamed for the bridgemen to drop amid another spray of\narrows. One sliced open the skin near his ribs, deflecting off the bone. He\nfelt it hit, but didn’t feel any pain. He scrambled around the side of the\nbridge, helping push. Kaladin’s team slammed the bridge into place as a\nwave of Alethi arrows distracted the enemy archers.\nA troop of cavalry charged across the bridges. The bridgemen were\nsoon forgotten. Kaladin fell to his knees beside the bridge as the others of\nhis crew stumbled away, bloodied and hurt, their part in the battle over.\nKaladin held his side, feeling the blood there. Straight laceration, only\nabout an inch long, not wide enough to be of danger.\nIt was his father’s voice.\nKaladin panted. He needed to get to safety. Arrows zipped over his\nhead, fired by the Alethi archers.\nSome people take lives. Other people save lives.\nHe wasn’t done yet. Kaladin forced himself to his feet and staggered to\nwhere someone lay beside the bridge. It was a bridgeman named Hobber;\nhe had an arrow through the leg. The man moaned, holding his thigh.\nKaladin grabbed him under the arms and pulled him away from the\nbridge. The man cursed at the pain, dazed, as Kaladin towed him to a cleft\nbehind a small bulge in the rock where Rock and some of the other\nbridgemen had sought shelter.\nAfter dropping off Hobber—the arrow hadn’t hit any major arteries,\nand he would be fine for a time yet—Kaladin turned and tried to rush back\nout onto the battlefield proper. He slipped, however, stumbling in his\nfatigue. He hit the ground hard, grunting.\nSome take lives. Some save lives.\nHe pushed himself to his feet, sweat dripping from his brow, and\nscrambled back toward the bridge, his father’s voice in his ears. The next\nbridgeman he found, a man named Koorm, was dead. Kaladin left the body.\nGadol had a deep wound in the side where an arrow had passed\ncompletely through him. His face was covered with blood from a gash on\nhis temple, and he’d managed to crawl a short distance from the bridge. He\nlooked up with frenzied black eyes, orange painspren waving around him.\nKaladin grabbed him under the arms and towed him away just before a\nthundering charge of cavalry trampled the place where he’d been lying.\nKaladin dragged Gadol over to the cleft, noting two more dead. He did\na quick count. That made twenty-nine bridgemen, including the dead he’d\nseen. Five were missing. Kaladin stumbled back out onto the battlefield.\nSoldiers had bunched up around the back of the bridge, archers\nforming at the sides and firing into the Parshendi lines as the heavy cavalry"

Kaladin stumbled back out onto the battlefield.\nSoldiers had bunched up around the back of the bridge, archers\nforming at the sides and firing into the Parshendi lines as the heavy cavalry\ncharge—led by Highprince Sadeas himself, virtually indestructible in his\nShardplate—tried to push the enemy back.\nKaladin wavered, dizzy, dismayed at the sight of so many men\nrunning, shouting, firing arrows and throwing spears. Five bridgemen,\nprobably dead, lost in all of that—\nHe spotted a figure huddled just beside the chasm lip with arrows\nflying back and forth over his head. It was Dabbid, one of the bridgemen.\nHe curled up, arm twisted at an awkward angle.\nKaladin charged in. He threw himself to the ground and crawled\nbeneath the zipping arrows, hoping that the Parshendi would ignore a\ncouple of unarmed bridgemen. Dabbid didn’t even notice when Kaladin\nreached him. He was in shock, lips moving soundlessly, eyes dazed.\nKaladin grabbed him awkwardly, afraid to stand up too high lest an arrow\nhit him.\nHe dragged Dabbid away from the edge in a clumsy half crawl. He\nkept slipping on blood, falling, abrading his arms on the rock, hitting his\nface against the stone. He persisted, towing the younger man out from\nunderneath the flying arrows. Finally, he got far enough away that he risked\nstanding. He tried to pick up Dabbid. But his muscles were so weak. He\nstrained and slipped, exhausted, falling to the stones.\nHe lay there, gasping, the pain of his side finally washing over him. So\ntired….\nHe stood up shakily, then tried again to grab Dabbid. He blinked away\ntears of frustration, too weak to even pull the man.\n“Airsick lowlander,” a voice growled.\nKaladin turned as Rock arrived. The massive Horneater grabbed\nDabbid under the arms, pulling him. “Crazy,” he grumbled to Kaladin, but\neasily lifted the wounded bridgeman and carried him back to the hollow.\nKaladin followed. He collapsed in the hollow, his back to the rock. The\nsurviving bridgemen huddled around him, eyes haunted. Rock set Dabbid\ndown.\n“Four more,” Kaladin said between gasps. “We have to find them….”\n“Murk and Leyten,” Teft said. The older bridgeman had been near the\nback this run, and hadn’t taken any wounds. “And Adis and Corl. They\nwere in the front.”\nThat’s right, Kaladin thought, exhausted. How could I forget…. “Murk\nis dead,” he said. “The others might live.” He tried to stumble to his feet.\n“Idiot,” Rock said. “Stay here. Is all right. I will do this thing.” He\nhesitated. “Guess I’m an idiot too.” He scowled, but went back out onto the\nbattlefield. Teft hesitated, then chased after him.\nKaladin breathed in and out, holding his side. He couldn’t decide if the\npain of the arrow impact hurt more than the cut.\nSave lives….\nHe crawled over to the three wounded. Hobber—with an arrow"

Hobber—with an arrow\nthrough the leg—would wait, and Dabbid had only a broken arm. Gadol\nwas the worst off, with that hole in his side. Kaladin stared at the wound.\nHe didn’t have an operating table; he didn’t even have antiseptic. How was\nhe supposed to do anything?\nHe shoved despair aside. “One of you go fetch me a knife,” he told the\nbridgemen. “Take it off the body of a soldier who has fallen. Someone else\nbuild a fire!”\nThe bridgemen looked at each other.\n“Dunny, you get the knife,” Kaladin said as he held his hand to\nGadol’s wound, trying to stanch the blood. “Narm, can you make a fire?”\n“With what?” the man asked.\nKaladin pulled off his vest and shirt, then handed the shirt to Narm.\n“Use this as tinder and gather some fallen arrows for wood. Does anyone\nhave flint and steel?”\nMoash did, fortunately. You carried anything valuable you had with\nyou on a bridge run; other bridgemen might steal it if you left it behind.\n“Move quickly!” Kaladin said. “Someone else, go rip open a rockbud\nand get me the watergourd inside.”\nThey stood for a few moments. Then, blessedly, they did as he\ndemanded. Perhaps they were too stunned to object. Kaladin tore open\nGadol’s shirt, exposing the wound. It was bad, terribly bad. If it had cut the\nintestines or some of the other organs…\nHe ordered one of the bridgemen to hold a bandage to Gadol’s\nforehead to stanch the smaller blood flow there—anything would help—and\ninspected the wounded side with the speed his father had taught him. Dunny\nreturned quickly with a knife. Narm was having trouble with the fire,\nthough. The man cursed, trying his flint and steel again.\nGadol was spasming. Kaladin pressed bandages to the wound, feeling\nhelpless. There wasn’t a place he could make a tourniquet for a wound like\nthis. There wasn’t anything he could do but—\nGadol spit up blood, coughing. “They break the land itself!” he hissed,\neyes wild. “They want it, but in their rage they will destroy it. Like the\njealous man burns his rich things rather than let them be taken by his\nenemies! They come!”\nHe gasped. And then he fell still, his dead eyes staring upward, bloody\nspittle running in a trail down his cheek. His final, haunting words hung\nover them. Not far away, soldiers fought and screamed, but the bridgemen\nwere silent.\nKaladin sat back, stunned—as always—by the pain of losing someone.\nHis father had always said that time would dull his sensitivity.\nIn this, Lirin had been wrong.\nHe felt so tired. Rock and Teft were hurrying back toward the cleft in\nthe rock, bearing a body between them.\nThey wouldn’t have brought anyone unless he was still alive, Kaladin\ntold himself. Think of the ones you can help. “Keep that fire going!” he said,"

Think of the ones you can help. “Keep that fire going!” he said,\npointing at Narm. “Don’t let it die! Someone heat the blade in it.”\nNarm jumped, noticing as if for the first time that he’d actually\nmanaged to get a small flame started. Kaladin turned away from the dead\nGadol and made room for Rock and Teft. They deposited a very bloody\nLeyten on the ground. He was breathing shallowly and had two arrows\nsticking from him, one from the shoulder, the other from the opposite arm.\nAnother had grazed his stomach, and the cut there had been widened by\nmovement. It looked like his left leg had been trampled by a horse; it was\nbroken, and he had a large gash where the skin had split.\n“The other three are dead,” Teft said. “He nearly is too. Nothing much\nwe can do. But you said to bring him, so—”\nKaladin knelt down immediately, working with careful, efficient speed.\nHe pressed a bandage against the side, holding it in place with his knee,\nthen tied a quick bandage on the leg, ordering one of the soldiers to hold it\nfirm and elevate the limb. “Where’s that knife!” Kaladin yelled, hurriedly\ntying a loose tourniquet around the arm. He needed to stop the blood right\nnow; he’d worry about saving the arm later.\nYouthful Dunny rushed over with the heated blade. Kaladin lifted the\nside bandage and quickly cauterized the wound there. Leyten was\nunconscious, his breathing growing more shallow.\n“You will not die,” Kaladin muttered. “You will not die!” His mind\nwas numb, but his fingers knew the motions. For a moment, he was back in\nhis father’s surgery room, listening to careful instruction. He cut the arrow\nfrom Leyten’s arm, but left the one in his shoulder, then sent the knife back\nto be reheated.\nPeet finally returned with the watergourd. Kaladin snatched it, using it\nto clean the leg wound, which was the nastiest, as it had been caused by\ntrampling. When the knife came back, Kaladin pulled the arrow free of the\nshoulder and cauterized the wound as best he could, then used another of\nhis quickly disappearing bandages to tie the wound.\nHe splinted the leg with arrow shafts—the only thing they had. With a\ngrimace, he cauterized the wound there too. He hated to cause so many\nscars, but he couldn’t afford to let any more blood be lost. He was going to\nneed antiseptic. How soon could he get some of that mucus?\n“Don’t you dare die!” Kaladin said, barely conscious that he was\nspeaking. He quickly tied off the leg wound, then used his needle and\nthread to sew the arm wound. He bandaged it, then untied the tourniquet\nmost of the way.\nFinally, he settled back, looking at the wounded man, completely\ndrained. Leyten was still breathing. How long would that last? The odds\nwere against him.\nThe bridgemen stood or sat around Kaladin, looking strangely"

Kaladin tiredly moved over to Hobber and saw to the man’s leg\nwound. It didn’t need to be cauterized. Kaladin washed it out, cut away\nsome splinters, then sewed it. There were painspren all around the man, tiny\norange hands stretching up from the ground.\nKaladin sliced off the cleanest portion of bandage he’d used on Gadol\nand tied it around Hobber’s wound. He hated the uncleanliness of it, but\nthere was no other choice. Then he set Dabbid’s arm with some arrows he\nhad the other bridgemen fetch, using Dabbid’s shirt to tie them in place.\nThen, finally, Kaladin sat back against the lip of stone, letting out a long,\nfatigued breath.\nBangs of metal on metal and shouts of soldiers rang from behind. He\nfelt so tired. Too tired to even close his eyes. He just wanted to sit and stare\nat the ground forever.\nTeft settled down beside him. The grizzled man had the watergourd,\nwhich still had some liquid in the bottom. “Drink, lad. You need it.”\n“We should clean the wounds of the other men,” Kaladin said numbly.\n“They took scrapes—I saw some had cuts—and they should—”\n“Drink,” Teft said, his crackly voice insistent.\nKaladin hesitated, then drank the water. It tasted strongly bitter, like\nthe plant from which it had been taken.\n“Where’d you learn to heal men like that?” Teft asked. Several of the\nnearby bridgemen turned toward him at the question.\n“I wasn’t always a slave,” Kaladin whispered.\n“These things you did, they won’t make a difference,” Rock said,\nwalking up. The massive Horneater squatted down. “Gaz makes us leave\nbehind wounded who cannot walk. Is standing order from above.”\n“I’ll deal with Gaz,” Kaladin said, resting his head back against the\nstone. “Go return that knife to the body you took it off. I don’t want to be\naccused of thievery. Then, when the time comes to leave, I want two men in\ncharge of Leyten and two men in charge of Hobber. We’ll tie them to the\ntop of the bridge and carry them. At the chasms, you’ll have to move\nquickly and untie them before the army crosses, then retie them at the end.\nWe’ll also need someone to lead Dabbid, if his shock hasn’t passed.”\n“Gaz won’t stand for this thing,” Rock said.\nKaladin closed his eyes, declining further argument.\nThe battle was a long one. As evening approached, the Parshendi\nfinally retreated, jumping away across the chasms with their unnaturally\npowerful legs. There was a chorus of shouts from the Alethi soldiers, who\nhad won the day. Kaladin forced himself to his feet and went looking for\nGaz. It would be a while yet before they could get the chrysalis open—it\nwas like pounding on stone—but he needed to deal with the bridge\nsergeant.\nHe found Gaz watching from well behind the battle lines.

He glanced\nat Kaladin with his one eye. “How much of that blood is yours?”\nKaladin looked down, realizing for the first time that he was crusted\nwith dark, flaking blood, most belonging to the men he’d worked on. He\ndidn’t answer the question. “We’re taking our wounded with us.”\nGaz shook his head. “If they can’t walk, they stay behind. Standing\norders. Not my choice.”\n“We’re taking them,” Kaladin said, no more firm, no more loud.\n“Brightlord Lamaril won’t stand for it.” Lamaril was Gaz’s immediate\nsuperior.\n“You’ll send Bridge Four last, to lead the wounded soldiers back to\ncamp. Lamaril won’t go with that troop; he’ll go on ahead with the main\nbody, as he won’t want to miss Sadeas’s victory feast.”\nGaz opened his mouth.\n“My men will move quickly and efficiently,” Kaladin said, interrupting\nhim. “They won’t slow anyone.” He took the last sphere from his pocket\nand handed it over. “You won’t say anything.”\nGaz took the sphere, snorting. “One clearmark? You think that will\nmake me take a risk this big?”\n“If you don’t,” Kaladin said, voice calm, “I will kill you and let them\nexecute me.”\nGaz blinked in surprise. “You’d never—”\nKaladin took a single step forward. He must have looked a dreadful\nsight, covered in blood. Gaz paled. Then he cursed, holding up the dark\nsphere. “And a dun sphere at that.”\nKaladin frowned. He was sure it had still glowed before the bridge run.\n“That’s your fault. You gave it to me.”\n“Those spheres were newly infused last night,” Gaz said. “They came\nstraight from Brightlord Sadeas’s treasurer. What did you do with them?”\nKaladin shook his head, too exhausted to think. Syl landed on his\nshoulder as he turned to walk back to the bridgemen.\n“What are they to you?” Gaz called after him. “Why do you even\ncare?”\n“They’re my men.”\nHe left Gaz behind. “I don’t trust him,” Syl said, looking over her\nshoulder. “He could just say you threatened him and send men to arrest\nyou.”\n“Maybe he will,” Kaladin said. “I guess I just have to count on him\nwanting more of my bribes.”\nKaladin continued on, listening to the shouts of the victors and the\ngroans of their wounded. The plateaus were littered with corpses, bunched\nup along the edges of the chasm, where the bridges had made a focus for\nthe battle. The Parshendi—as always—had left their dead behind. Even\nwhen they won, they reportedly left their dead. The humans sent back\nbridge crews and soldiers to burn their dead and send their spirits to the\nafterlife, where the best among them would fight in the Heralds’ army.\n“Spheres,” Syl said, still looking at Gaz. “That doesn’t seem like much\nto count on.”\n“Maybe.

But if there’s one thing you can count on, it’s their greed.”\nIt was a bitter thought. But it had been a bitter day. A hopeful, bright\nbeginning, and a bloody, red sunset.\nJust like every day.\nMap of Alethi warcamps by the painter Vandonas, who visited the\nwarcamps once and painted perhaps an idealized representation of\nthem.\nAti was once a kind and generous man, and you saw what became of\nhim. Rayse, on the other hand, was among the most loathsome, crafty,\nand dangerous individuals I had ever met.\n“Yeah, this was cut,” the portly leatherworker said, holding up the straps as\nAdolin watched. “Wouldn’t you agree, Yis?”\nThe other leatherworker nodded. Yis was a yellow-eyed Iriali, with\nstark golden hair. Not blond, golden. There was even a metallic sheen to it.\nHe kept it short and wore a cap. Obviously, he didn’t want to draw attention\nto it. Many considered a lock of Iriali hair to be a ward of good luck.\nHis companion, Avaran, was an Alethi darkeyes who wore an apron\nover his vest. If the two men worked in the traditional way, one would labor\non the larger, more robust pieces—like saddles—while the other specialized\nin fine detail. A group of apprentices toiled in the background, cutting or\nsewing hogshide.\n“Sliced,” Yis agreed, taking the straps from Avaran. “I concur.”\n“Well hie me to Damnation,” Adolin muttered. “You mean Elhokar\nwas actually right?”\n“Adolin,” a feminine voice said from behind. “You said we’d be going\non a walk.”\n“That’s what we’re doing,” he said, turning to smile. Janala stood with\narms folded, wearing a sleek yellow dress of impeccable fashion, buttoning\nup the sides, cupping around the neck with a stiff collar embroidered with\ncrimson thread.\n“I had imagined,” she said, “that a walk would involve more walking.”\n“Hm,” he said. “Yes. We’ll be getting right to that soon. It’ll be grand.\nLots of prancing, sauntering, and, er…”\n“Promenading?” Yis the leatherworker offered.\n“Isn’t that a type of drink?” Adolin asked.\n“Er, no, Brightlord. I’m fairly certain it’s another word for walking.”\n“Well, then,” Adolin said. “We’ll do plenty of it too. Promenading. I\nalways love a good promenading.” He rubbed his chin, taking the strap\nback. “How certain are you about this strap?”\n“There’s really no room for question, Brightlord,” Avaran said. “That’s\nnot a simple tear. You should be more careful.”\n“Careful?”"

You should be more careful.”\n“Careful?”\n“Yes,” Avaran said. “Make sure that no loose buckles are scraping the\nleather, cutting into it. This looks like it came from a saddle. Sometimes,\npeople let the girth straps hang down when setting the saddle for the night,\nand they get pinched underneath something. I’d guess that caused the slice.”\n“Oh,” Adolin said. “You mean it wasn’t cut intentionally?”\n“Well, it could have been that,” Avaran said. “But why would someone\ncut a girth like this?”\nWhy indeed, Adolin thought. He bid farewell to the two\nleatherworkers, tucked the strap into his pocket, then held out his elbow to\nJanala. She took it with her freehand, obviously happy to finally be free of\nthe leather-working shop. It had a faint odor about it, though not nearly as\nbad as a tannery. He’d seen her reaching for her handkerchief a few times,\nacting as if she wanted to hold it up to her nose.\nThey stepped out into the midday sunlight. Tibon and Marks—two\nlighteyed members of the Cobalt Guard—waited outside with Janala’s\nhandmaiden, Falksi, who was a young Azish darkeyes. The three fell into\nstep behind Adolin and Janala as they walked out onto the street of the\nwarcamp, Falksi muttering under her breath in an accented voice about the\nlack of a proper palanquin for her mistress.\nJanala didn’t seem to mind. She breathed deeply of the open air and\nclung to his arm. She was quite beautiful, even if she did like to talk about\nherself. Talkativeness was normally an attribute he was fond of in a woman,\nbut today he had trouble paying attention as Janala began telling him about\nthe latest court gossip.\nThe strap had been cut, but the leatherworkers had both assumed that it\nwas the result of an accident. That implied they’d seen cuts like this before.\nA loose buckle or other mishap slicing the leather.\nExcept this time, that cut had thrown the king in the middle of a fight.\nCould there be something to it?\n“…wouldn’t you say, Adolin?” Janala asked.\n“Undoubtedly,” he said, listening with half an ear.\n“So you’ll talk to him?”\n“Hum?”\n“Your father. You’ll ask him about letting the men abandon that\ndreadfully unfashionable uniform once in a while?”\n“Well, he’s rather set on the idea,” Adolin said. “Besides, it’s really not\nthat unfashionable.”\nJanala gave him a flat stare.\n“All right,” he admitted. “It is a little drab.” Like every other high-\nranked lighteyed officer in Dalinar’s army, Adolin wore a simple blue out-fit\nof militaristic cut. A long coat of solid blue—no embroidery—and stiff\ntrousers in a time when vests, silk accents, and scarves were the fashion.\nHis father’s Kholin glyphpair was emblazoned quite obtrusively on the back\nand breast, and the front fastened with silver buttons up both sides.

It was\nsimple, distinctly recognizable, but awfully plain.\n“Your father’s men love him, Adolin,” Janala said. “But his\nrequirements are growing tiresome.”\n“I know. Trust me. But I don’t think I can change his mind.” How to\nexplain? Despite six years at war, Dalinar wasn’t weakening in his resolve\nto hold to the Codes. If anything, his dedication to them was strengthening.\nAt least now Adolin understood somewhat. Dalinar’s beloved brother\nhad made one last request: Follow the Codes. True, that request had been in\nreference to a single event, but Adolin’s father was known to take things to\nextremes.\nAdolin just wished he wouldn’t make the same requirement of\neveryone else. Individually, the Codes were only minor inconveniences—\nalways be in uniform when in public, never be drunken, avoid dueling. In\naggregate, however, they were burdensome.\nHis response to Janala was cut off as a set of horns blared through the\ncamp. Adolin perked up, spinning, looking eastward toward the Shattered\nPlains. He counted off the next series of horns. A chrysalis had been spotted\non plateau one-forty-seven. That was within striking distance!\nHe held his breath, waiting for a third series of horns to blare, calling\nDalinar’s armies to battle. That would only happen if his father ordered it.\nPart of him knew those horns wouldn’t come. One-forty-seven was\nclose enough to Sadeas’s warcamp that the other highprince would certainly\ntry for it.\nCome on, Father, Adolin thought. We can race him for it!\nNo horns came.\nAdolin glanced at Janala. She’d chosen music as her Calling and paid\nlittle attention to the war, though her father was one of Dalinar’s cavalry\nofficers. From her expression, Adolin could tell that even she understood\nwhat the lack of a third horn meant.\nOnce again, Dalinar Kholin had chosen not to fight.\n“Come on,” Adolin said, turning and moving in another direction,\npractically towing Janala along by her elbow. “There’s something else I\nwant to check into.”\nDalinar stood with hands clasped behind his back, looking out over the\nShattered Plains. He was on one of the lower terraces outside Elhokar’s\nelevated palace—the king didn’t reside in one of the ten warcamps, but in a\nsmall compound elevated along a hillside nearby. Dalinar’s climb to the\npalace had been interrupted by the horns.\nHe stood long enough see Sadeas’s army gathering inside his camp.\nDalinar could have sent a soldier to prepare his own men. He was close\nenough.\n“Brightlord?” a voice asked from the side. “Do you wish to continue?”\nYou protect him your way, Sadeas, Dalinar thought. I’ll protect him my\nway.\n“Yes, Teshav,” he said, turning to continue walking up the\nswitchbacks.\nTeshav joined him.

She had\nviolet eyes, and her pinched face bore a concerned expression. That was\nnormal; she always seemed to need something to worry about.\nTeshav and her attendant scribe were both wives of his officers.\nDalinar trusted them. Mostly. It was hard to trust anyone completely. Stop\nit, he thought. You’re starting to sound as paranoid as the king.\nRegardless, he’d be very glad for Jasnah’s return. If she ever decided\nto return. Some of his higher officers hinted to him that he should marry\nagain, if only to have a woman who could be his primary scribe. They\nthought he rejected their suggestions because of love for his first wife. They\ndidn’t know that she was gone, vanished from his mind, a blank patch of\nfog in his memory. Though, in a way, his officers were right. He hesitated to\nremarry because he hated the idea of replacing her. He’d had everything of\nhis wife taken from him. All that remained was the hole, and filling it to\ngain a scribe seemed callous.\nDalinar continued on his way. Other than the two women, he was\nattended by Renarin and three members of the Cobalt Guard. The latter\nwore deep blue felt caps and cloaks over silvery breastplates and deep blue\ntrousers. They were lighteyes of low rank, able to carry swords for close\nfighting.\n“Well, Brightlord,” Teshav said, “Brightlord Adolin asked me to report\nthe progress of the saddle girth investigation. He’s speaking with\nleatherworkers at this very moment, but so far, there is very little to say.\nNobody witnessed anyone interfering with the saddle or His Majesty’s\nhorse. Our spies say there are no whispers of anyone in the other warcamps\nbragging, and nobody in our camp has suddenly received large sums of\nmoney, so far as we’ve discovered.”\n“The grooms?”\n“Say they checked over the saddle,” she said, “but when pressed, they\nadmit that they can’t specifically remember checking the girth.” She shook\nher head. “Carrying a Shardbearer places great strain on both horse and\nsaddle. If there were only some way to tame more Ryshadium….”\n“I think you’ll sooner tame the highstorms, Brightness. Well, this is\ngood news, I suppose. Better for us all that this strap business turns out to\nbe nothing. Now, there is another item I wish you to look into.”\n“It is my pleasure to serve, Brightlord.”\n“Highprince Aladar has begun to talk of taking a short vacation back to\nAlethkar. I want to know if he’s serious.”\n“Yes, Brightlord.” Teshav nodded. “Would that be a problem?”\n“I’m honestly not sure.” He didn’t trust the highprinces, but at least\nwith them all here, he could watch them. If one of them returned to\nAlethkar, the man could scheme unchecked. Of course, even brief visits\nmight help stabilize their homeland.\nWhich was more important? Stability or the ability to watch over the\nothers? Blood of my fathers, he thought. I wasn’t made for this politicking"

I wasn’t made for this politicking\nand scheming. I was made to wield a sword and ride down enemies.\nHe’d do what needed to be done anyway. “I believe you said you had\ninformation on the king’s accounts, Teshav?”\n“Indeed,” she said as they continued the short hike. “You were correct\nto have me look into the ledgers, as it appears that three of the highprinces\n—Thanadal, Hatham, and Vamah—are well behind in their payments. Other\nthan yourself, only Highprince Sadeas has actually paid ahead on what is\nowed, as the tenets of war require.”\nDalinar nodded. “The longer this war stretches, the more comfortable\nthe highprinces are getting. They’re starting to question. Why pay high war\ntime rates for Soulcasting? Why not move farmers out here and start\ngrowing their own food?”\n“Pardon, Brightlord,” Teshav said as they turned around a switchback.\nHer attendant scribe walked behind, several ledgers clipped to boards\ncarried in a satchel. “But do we really wish to discourage that? A second\nstream of supplies could be valuable as a redundancy.”\n“The merchants already provide redundancy,” Dalinar said. “Which is\none of the reasons I haven’t chased them off. I wouldn’t mind another, but\nthe Soulcasters are the only hold we have on the highprinces. They owed\nGavilar loyalty, but they feel little of that for his son.” Dalinar narrowed his\neyes. “This is a vital point, Teshav. Have you read the histories I\nsuggested?”\n“Yes, Brightlord.”\n“Then you know. The most fragile period in a kingdom’s existence\ncomes during the lifetime of its founder’s heir. During the reign of a man\nlike Gavilar, men stay loyal because of their respect for him. During\nsubsequent generations, men begin to see themselves as part of a kingdom,\na united force that holds together because of tradition.\n“But the son’s reign…that’s the dangerous point. Gavilar isn’t here to\nhold everyone together, but there isn’t yet a tradition of Alethkar being a\nkingdom. We’ve got to carry on long enough for the highprinces to begin\nseeing themselves as part of a greater whole.”\n“Yes, Brightlord.”\nShe didn’t question. Teshav was deeply loyal to him, as were most of\nhis officers. They didn’t question why it was so important to him that the\nten princedoms regard themselves as one nation. Perhaps they assumed it\nwas because of Gavilar. Indeed, his brother’s dream of a united Alethkar\nwas part of it. There was something else, though.\nThe Everstorm comes. The True Desolation. The Night of Sorrows.\nHe suppressed a shiver. The visions certainly didn’t make it sound like\nhe had a great deal of time to prepare.\n“Draft a missive in the king’s name,” Dalinar said, “decreasing\nSoulcasting costs for those who have made their payments on time. That\nshould wake up the others. Give it to Elhokar’s scribes and have them\nexplain it to him. Hopefully he will agree with the need.”"

In the past, such things haven’t\nbeen particular to your interests.”\n“I do a lot of things lately that aren’t particular to my interests or my\ntalents,” Dalinar said with a grimace. “My lack of capacity doesn’t change\nthe kingdom’s needs. Have you gathered reports of banditry in the area?”\n“Yes, Brightlord.” She hesitated. “The rates are quite alarming.”\n“Tell your husband I give him command of the Fourth Battalion,”\nDalinar said. “I want the two of you to work out a better pattern of patrol in\nthe Unclaimed Hills. So long as the Alethi monarchy has a presence here, I\ndo not want it to be a land of lawlessness.”\n“Yes, Brightlord,” Teshav said, sounding hesitant. “You realize that\nmeans you’ve committed two entire battalions to patrolling?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. He had asked for help from the other highprinces.\nTheir reactions had ranged from shock to mirth. None had given him any\nsoldiers.\n“That is added to the battalion you assigned to peacekeeping in the\nareas between warcamps and the exterior merchant markets,” Teshav added.\n“In total, that’s over a quarter of your forces here, Brightlord.”\n“The orders stand, Teshav.” he said. “See to it. But first, I have more to\ndiscuss with you regarding the ledgers. Go on ahead to the ledger room and\nwait for us there.”\nShe nodded respect. “Of course, Brightlord.” She withdrew with her\nward.\nRenarin stepped up to Dalinar. “She wasn’t pleased about that, Father.”\n“She wishes her husband to be fighting,” Dalinar said. “They all hope\nthat I’ll win another Shardblade out there, then give it to them.” The\nParshendi had Shards. Not many, but even a single one was surprising.\nNobody had an explanation for where they’d gotten them. Dalinar had won\na Parshendi Shardblade and Plate during his first year here. He’d given both\nto Elhokar to award to a warrior he felt would be the most useful to\nAlethkar and the war effort.\nDalinar turned and entered the palace proper. The guards at the\ndoorway saluted him and Renarin. The young man kept his eyes forward,\nstaring at nothing. Some people thought him emotionless, but Dalinar knew\nhe was just preoccupied.\n“I’ve been meaning to speak with you, son,” Dalinar said. “About the\nhunt last week.”\nRenarin’s eyes flickered downward in shame, the edges of his mouth\npulling back in a grimace. Yes, he did have emotions. He just didn’t show\nthem as often as others.\n“You realize that you shouldn’t have rushed into battle as you did,”\nDalinar said sternly. “That chasmfiend could have killed you.”\n“What would you have done, Father, if it had been me in danger?”\n“I don’t fault your bravery; I fault your wisdom. What if you’d had one"

What if you’d had one\nof your fits?”\n“Then perhaps the monster would have swept me off the plateau,”\nRenarin said bitterly, “and I would no longer be such a useless drain on\neveryone’s time.”\n“Don’t say such things! Not even in jest.”\n“Was it jest? Father, I can’t fight.”\n“Fighting is not the only thing of value a man can do.” The ardents\nwere very specific about that. Yes, the highest Calling of men was to join\nthe battle in the afterlife to reclaim the Tranquiline Halls, but the Almighty\naccepted the excellence of any man or woman, regardless of what they did.\nYou just did your best, picking a profession and an attribute of the\nAlmighty to emulate. A Calling and a Glory, it was said. You worked hard\nat your profession, and you spent your life trying to live according to a\nsingle ideal. The Almighty would accept that, particularly if you were\nlighteyed—the better your blood as a lighteyes, the more innate Glory you\nhad already.\nDalinar’s Calling was to be a leader, and his chosen Glory was\ndetermination. He’d chosen both in his youth, though he now viewed them\nvery differently than he once had.\n“You are right, of course, Father,” Renarin said. “I am not the first\nhero’s son to be born without any talent for warfare. The others all got\nalong. So shall I. Likely I will end up as citylord of a small town. Assuming\nI don’t tuck myself away in the devotaries.” The boy’s eyes turned forward.\nI still think of him as “the boy,” Dalinar thought. Even though he’s now\nin his twentieth year. Wit had been right. Dalinar underestimated Renarin.\nHow would I react, if I were forbidden to fight? Kept back with the women\nand the merchants?\nDalinar would have been bitter, particularly against Adolin. In fact,\nDalinar had often been envious of Gavilar during their boyhood. Renarin,\nhowever, was Adolin’s greatest supporter. He all but worshipped his elder\nbrother. And he was brave enough to dash heedless into the middle of a\nbattlefield where a nightmare creature was smashing spearmen and tossing\naside Shardbearers.\nDalinar cleared his throat. “Perhaps it is time to again try training you\nin the sword.”\n“My blood weakness—”\n“Won’t matter a bit if we get you into a set of Plate and give you a\nBlade,” Dalinar said. “The armor makes any man strong, and a Shardblade\nis nearly as light as air itself.”\n“Father,” Renarin said flatly, “I’ll never be a Shardbearer. You yourself\nhave said that the Blades and Plate we win from the Parshendi must go to\nthe most skilled warriors.”\n“None of the other highprinces give up their spoils to the king,”\nDalinar said. “And who would fault me if, for once, I made a gift to my\nson?”\nRenarin stopped in the hallway, displaying an unusual level of\nemotion, eyes opening wider, face eager. “You are serious?”\n“I give you my oath, son.

If I can capture another Blade and Plate, they\nwill go to you.” He smiled. “To be honest, I’d do it simply for the joy of\nseeing Sadeas’s face when you become a full Shardbearer. Beyond that, if\nyour strength is made equal to others, I expect that your natural skill will\nmake you shine.”\nRenarin smiled. Shardplate wouldn’t solve everything, but Renarin\nwould have his chance. Dalinar would see to it. I know what it’s like to be a\nsecond son, he thought as they continued walking toward the king’s\nchambers, overshadowed by an older brother you love yet envy at the same\ntime. Stormfather, but I do.\nI still feel that way.\n“Ah, good Brightlord Adolin,” the ardent said, walking forward with open\narms. Kadash was a tall man in his later years, and wore the shaved head\nand square beard of his Calling. He also had a twisting scar that ran around\nthe top of his head, a memento from his earlier days as an army officer.\nIt was uncommon to find a man such as him—a lighteyes who had\nonce been a soldier—in the ardentia. In fact, it was odd for any man to\nchange his Calling. But it wasn’t forbidden, and Kadash had risen far in the\nardentia considering his late start. Dalinar said it was a sign of either faith\nor perseverance. Perhaps both.\nThe warcamp’s temple had started as a large Soulcast dome, then\nDalinar had granted money and stonemasons to transform it into a more\nsuitable house of worship. Carvings of the Heralds now lined the inside\nwalls, and broad windows carved on the leeward side had been set with\nglass to let in the light. Diamond spheres blazed in bunches hung from the\nhigh ceiling, and stands had been set up for the instruction, practice, and\ntesting of the various arts.\nMany women were in at the moment, receiving instruction from the\nardents. There were fewer men. Being at war, it was easy to practice the\nmasculine arts in the field.\nJanala folded her arms, scanning the temple with obvious\ndissatisfaction as she stood beside Adolin. “First a stinky leatherworker’s\nshop, now the temple? I had assumed we would walk someplace at least\nfaintly romantic.”\n“Religion’s romantic,” Adolin said, scratching his head. “Eternal love\nand all that, right?”\nShe eyed him. “I’m going to go wait outside.” She turned and walked\nout with her handmaiden. “And someone get me a storming palanquin.”\nAdolin frowned, watching her go. “I’ll have to buy her something\nquite expensive to make up for this, I suspect.”\n“I don’t see what the problem is,” Kadash said. “I think religion is\nromantic.”\n“You’re an ardent,” Adolin said flatly. “Besides, that scar makes you a\nlittle too unsightly for my tastes.” He sighed. “It’s not so much the temple\nthat has set her off, but my lack of attention. I haven’t been a very good\ncompanion today.”"

I haven’t been a very good\ncompanion today.”\n“You have matters pressing upon your mind, bright one?” Kadash\nasked. “Is this about your Calling? You haven’t made much progress lately.”\nAdolin grimaced. His chosen Calling was dueling. By working with\nthe ardents to make personal goals and fulfill them, he could prove himself\nto the Almighty. Unfortunately, during war, the Codes said Adolin was\nsupposed to limit his duels, as frivolous dueling could wound officers who\nmight be needed in battle.\nBut Adolin’s father avoided battle more and more. So what was the\npoint of not dueling? “Holy one,” Adolin said, “we need to speak\nsomewhere we can’t be overheard.”\nKadash raised an eyebrow and led Adolin around the central apex.\nVorin temples were always circular with a gently sloping mound at the\ncenter, by custom rising ten feet high. The building was dedicated to the\nAlmighty, maintained by Dalinar and the ardents he owned. All devotaries\nwere welcome to use it, though most would have their own chapter houses\nin one of the warcamps.\n“What is it you wish to ask of me, bright one?” the ardent asked once\nthey reached a more secluded section of the vast chamber. Kadash was\ndeferential, though he had tutored and trained Adolin during his childhood.\n“Is my father going mad?” Adolin asked. “Or could he really be seeing\nvisions sent by the Almighty, as I think he believes?”\n“That’s a rather blunt question.”\n“You’ve known him longer than most, Kadash, and I know you to be\nloyal. I also know you to be one who keeps his ears open and notices things,\nso I’m sure you’ve heard the rumors.” Adolin shrugged. “Seems like a time\nfor bluntness if there ever was one.”\n“I take it, then, the rumors are not unfounded.”\n“Unfortunately, no. It happens during every highstorm. He raves and\nthrashes about, and afterward claims to have seen things.”\n“What sorts of things?”\n“I’m not certain, precisely.” Adolin grimaced. “Things about the\nRadiants. And perhaps…about what is to come.”\nKadash looked disturbed. “This is dangerous territory, bright one.\nWhat you are asking me about risks tempting me to violate my oaths. I am\nan ardent, owned by and loyal to your father.”\n“But he is not your religious superior.”\n“No. But he is the Almighty’s guardian of this people, set to watch me\nand make certain I don’t rise above my station.” Kadash pursed his lips. “It\nis a delicate balance we walk, bright one. Do you know much of the\nHierocracy, the War of Loss?”\n“The church tried to seize control,” Adolin said, shrugging. “The\npriests tried to conquer the world—for its own good, they claimed.”\n“That was part of it,” Kadash said. “The part we speak of most often.\nBut the problem goes much deeper.

Men were not in command of their own religious paths; the\npriests controlled the doctrine, and few members of the Church were\nallowed to know theology. They were taught to follow the priests. Not the\nAlmighty or the Heralds, but the priests.”\nHe began walking, leading Adolin around the back rim of the temple\nchamber. They passed statues of the Heralds, five male, five female. In\ntruth, Adolin knew very little of what Kadash was saying. He’d never had\nmuch of a mind for history that didn’t relate directly to the command of\narmies.\n“The problem, bright one,” Kadash said, “was mysticism. The priests\nclaimed that common men could not understand religion or the Almighty.\nWhere there should have been openness, there was smoke and whispers.\nThe priests began to claim visions and prophecies, though such things had\nbeen denounced by the Heralds themselves. Voidbinding is a dark and evil\nthing, and the soul of it was to try to divine the future.”\nAdolin froze. “Wait, you’re saying—”\n“Don’t get ahead of me please, bright one,” Kadash assured, turning\nback toward him. “When the priests of the Hierocracy were cast down, the\nSunmaker made a point of interrogating them and going through their\ncorrespondences with one another. It was discovered that there had been no\nprophecies. No mystical promises from the Almighty. That had all been an\nexcuse, fabricated by the priests to placate and control the people.”\nAdolin frowned. “Where are you going with this, Kadash?”\n“As close as I dare to the truth, bright one,” the ardent said. “As I\ncannot be as blunt as you.”\n“You think my father’s visions are fabrications, then.”\n“I would never accuse my highprince of lying,” Kadash said. “Or even\nof feebleness. But neither can I condone mysticism or prophecy in any\nform. To do so would be to deny Vorinism. The days of the priests are gone.\nThe days of lying to the people, of keeping them in darkness, are gone.\nNow, each man chooses his own path, and the ardents help him achieve\ncloseness to the Almighty through it. Instead of shadowed prophecies and\npretend powers held by a few, we have a population who understand their\nbeliefs and their relationship with their God.”\nHe stepped closer, speaking very softly. “Your father is not to be\nmocked or diminished. If his visions are true, then it is between him and the\nAlmighty. All I can say is this: I know something of what it is to be haunted\nby the death and destruction of war. I see in your father’s eyes much of\nwhat I have felt, but worse. My personal opinion is that the things he sees\nare likely more a reflection of his past than any mystical experience.”\n“So he is going mad,” Adolin whispered.\n“I did not say that.”\n“You implied that the Almighty probably wouldn’t send visions like\nthese.”\n“I did.”\n“And that his visions are a product of his own mind.”\n“Likely so,” the ardent said, raising his finger. “A delicate balance, you\nsee.

It would not be the place of any other, even\nmyself.”\nAdolin nodded slowly. “Thank you.”\n“You should likely go see to that young woman now.”\n“Yes,” Adolin said with a sigh. “I fear that even with the right gift, she\nand I are not long for courting. Renarin will mock me again.”\nKadash smiled. “Best not to give up so easily, bright one. Go now. But\ndo return sometime so we can speak of your goals in regard to your Calling.\nIt has been too long since you’ve Elevated.”\nAdolin nodded and hurried from the chamber.\nAfter hours going over the ledgers with Teshav, Dalinar and Renarin\nreached the hallway before the king’s chambers. They walked in silence, the\nsoles of their boots clapping the marble flooring, the sound echoing against\nstone walls.\nThe corridors of the king’s war palace were growing richer by the\nweek. Once, this hallway had been just another Soulcast stone tunnel. As\nElhokar settled in, he had ordered improvements. Windows were cut into\nthe leeward side. Marble tiling was set into the floor. The walls were carved\nwith reliefs, with mosaic trim at the corners. Dalinar and Renarin passed a\ngroup of stonemasons carefully cutting a scene of Nalan’Elin, emitting\nsunlight, the sword of retribution held over his head.\nThey reached the king’s antechamber, a large, open room guarded by\nten members of the King’s Guard, dressed in blue and gold. Dalinar\nrecognized each face; he had personally organized the unit, handpicking its\nmembers.\nHighprince Ruthar waited to see the king. He had brawny arms folded\nin front of him, and wore a short black beard that surrounded his mouth.\nThe red silk coat was cut short and did not button; almost more of a sleeved\nvest, it was a mere token nod to traditional Alethi uniform. The shirt\nunderneath was ruffled and white, and his blue trousers were loose, with\nwide cuffs.\nRuthar glanced Dalinar’s way and nodded to him—a minor token of\nrespect—then turned to chat with one of his attendants. He cut off, however,\nas the guards at the doorway stepped aside to let Dalinar enter. Ruthar\nsniffed in annoyance. Dalinar’s easy access to the king galled the other\nhighprinces.\nThe king wasn’t in his wardroom, but the wide doors to his balcony\nwere open. Dalinar’s guardsmen waited behind as he stepped out onto the\nbalcony, Renarin hesitantly following. The light outside was dimming as\nsunset neared.

        "text": "campaign conundrum. Did one choose the best position to weather storms,\nor did one seize the high ground?\nMost would have chosen the former; their warcamps on the edge of the\nShattered Plains were unlikely to be attacked, making the advantage of the\nhigh ground less important. But kings tended to prefer height. In this\ninstance, Dalinar had encouraged Elhokar, just in case.\nThe balcony itself was a thick platform of rock cut onto the top of the\nsmall peak, edged with an iron railing. The king’s rooms were a Soulcast\ndome sitting atop the natural formation, with covered ramps and stairways\nleading to tiers lower on the hillside. Those housed the king’s various\nattendants: guards, stormwardens, ardents, and distant family members.\nDalinar had his own bunker at his warcamp. He refused to call it a palace.\nThe king leaned against the railing, two guards watching from a\ndistance. Dalinar motioned for Renarin to join them, so that he could speak\nwith the king in private.\nThe air was cool—spring having come for a time—and it was sweet\nwith the scents of evening: blooming rockbuds and wet stone. Below, the\nwarcamps were starting to come alight, ten sparkling circles filled with\nwatch-fires, cook fires, lamps, and the steady glow of infused gems. Elhokar\nstared over the camps and toward the Shattered Plains. They were utterly\ndark, save for the occasional twinkle of a watchpost.\n“Do they watch us, from out there?” Elhokar asked as Dalinar joined\nhim.\n“We know their raiding bands move at night, Your Majesty,” Dalinar\nsaid, resting one hand on the iron railing. “I can’t help but think they watch\nus.”\nThe king’s uniform had the traditional long coat with buttons up the\nsides, but it was loose and relaxed, and ruffled lace poked out of the collar\nand cuffs. His trousers were solid blue, and were cut in the same baggy\nfashion as Ruthar’s. It all looked so informal to Dalinar. Increasingly, their\nsoldiers were being led by a slack group who dressed in lace and spent their\nevenings at feasts.\nThis is what Gavilar foresaw, Dalinar thought. This is why he grew so\ninsistent that we follow the Codes.\n“You look thoughtful, Uncle,” Elhokar said.\n“Just considering the past, Your Majesty.”\n“The past is irrelevant. I only look forward.”\nDalinar was not certain he agreed with either statement.\n“I sometimes think I should be able to see the Parshendi,” Elhokar\nsaid. “I feel that if I stare long enough, I will find them, pin them down so I\ncan challenge them. I wish they’d just fight me, like men of honor.”\n“If they were men of honor,” Dalinar said, clasping his hands behind\nhis back, “then they would not have killed your father as they did.”\n“Why did they do it, do you suppose?”\nDalinar shook his head. “That question has churned in my head, over\nand over, like a boulder tumbling down a hill. Did we off end their honor?\nWas it some cultural misunderstanding?”\n“A cultural misunderstanding would imply that they have a culture."

Did we off end their honor?\nWas it some cultural misunderstanding?”\n“A cultural misunderstanding would imply that they have a culture.\nPrimitive brutes. Who knows why a horse kicks or an axehound bites? I\nshouldn’t have asked.”\nDalinar didn’t reply. He’d felt that same disdain, that same anger, in\nthe months following Gavilar’s assassination. He could understand\nElhokar’s desire to dismiss these strange, wildland parshmen as little more\nthan animals.\nBut he’d seen them during those early days. Interacted with them.\nThey were primitive, yes, but not brutes. Not stupid. We never really\nunderstood them, he thought. I guess that’s the crux of the problem.\n“Elhokar,” he said softly. “It may be time to ask ourselves some\ndifficult questions.”\n“Such as?”\n“Such as how long we will continue this war.”\nElhokar started. He turned, looking at Dalinar. “We’ll keep fighting\nuntil the Vengeance Pact is satisfied and my father is avenged!”\n“Noble words,” Dalinar said. “But we’ve been away from Alethkar for\nsix years now. Maintaining two far-flung centers of government is not\nhealthy for the kingdom.”\n“Kings often go to war for extended periods, Uncle.”\n“Rarely do they do it for so long,” Dalinar said, “and rarely do they\nbring every Shardbearer and Highprince in the kingdom with them. Our\nresources are strained, and word from home is that the Reshi border\nencroachments grow increasingly bold. We are still fragmented as a people,\nslow to trust one another, and the nature of this extended war—without a\nclear path to victory and with a focus on riches rather than capturing ground\n—is not helping at all.”\nElhokar sniffed, wind blowing at them atop the peaked rock. “You say\nthere’s no clear path to victory? We’ve been winning! The Parshendi raids\nare coming less frequently, and aren’t striking as far westward as they once\ndid. We’ve killed thousands of them in battle.”\n“Not enough,” Dalinar said. “They still come in strength. The siege is\nstraining us as much as, or more than, it is them.”\n“Weren’t you the one to suggest this tactic in the first place?”\n“I was a different man, then, flush with grief and anger.”\n“And you no longer feel those things?” Elhokar was incredulous.\n“Uncle, I can’t believe I’m hearing this! You aren’t seriously suggesting\nthat I abandon the war, are you? You’d have me slink home, like a scolded\naxehound?”\n“I said they were difficult questions, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said,\nkeeping his anger in check. It was taxing. “But they must be considered.”\nElhokar breathed out, annoyed. “It’s true, what Sadeas and the others\nwhisper. You’re changing, Uncle. It has something to do with those\nepisodes of yours, doesn’t it?”\n“They are unimportant, Elhokar. Listen to me! What are we willing to\ngive, in order to get vengeance?”\n“Anything.”\n“And if that means everything your father worked for? Do we honor"

Do we honor\nhis memory by undermining his vision for Alethkar, all to get revenge in his\nname?”\nThe king hesitated.\n“You pursue the Parshendi,” Dalinar said. “That is laudable. But you\ncan’t let your passion for just retribution blind you to the needs of our\nkingdom. The Vengeance Pact has kept the highprinces channeled, but what\nwill happen once we win? Will we shatter? I think we need to forge them\ntogether, to unite them. We fight this war as if we were ten different nations,\nfighting beside one another but not with one another.”\nThe king didn’t respond immediately. The words, finally, seemed to be\nsinking in. He was a good man, and shared more with his father than others\nchose to admit.\nHe turned away from Dalinar, leaning against the railing. “You think\nI’m a poor king, don’t you, Uncle?”\n“What? Of course not!”\n“You always talk about what I should be doing, and where I am\nlacking. Tell me truthfully, Uncle. When you look at me, do you wish you\nsaw my father’s face instead?”\n“Of course I do,” Dalinar said.\nElhokar’s expression darkened.\nDalinar laid a hand on his nephew’s shoulder. “I’d be a poor brother if\nI didn’t wish that Gavilar had lived. I failed him—it was the greatest, most\nterrible failure of my life.” Elhokar turned to him, and Dalinar held his\ngaze, raising a finger. “But just because I loved your father does not mean\nthat I think you are a failure. Nor does it mean I do not love you in your\nown right. Alethkar itself could have collapsed upon Gavilar’s death, but\nyou organized and executed our counterattack. You are a fine king.”\nThe king nodded slowly. “You’ve been listening to readings from that\nbook again, haven’t you?”\n“I have.”\n“You sound like him, you know,” Elhokar said, turning back to look\neastward again. “Near the end. When he began to act…erratically.”\n“Surely I’m not so bad as that.”\n“Perhaps. But this is much like how he was. Talking about an end to\nwar, fascinated by the Lost Radiants, insisting everyone follow the\nCodes…”\nDalinar remembered those days—and his own arguments with Gavilar.\nWhat honor can we find on a battlefield while our people starve? the king\nhad once asked him. Is it honor when our lighteyes plot and scheme like\neels in a bucket, slithering over one another and trying to bite each other’s\ntails?\nDalinar had reacted poorly to his words. Just as Elhokar was reacting\nto his words now. Stormfather! I am starting to sound like him, aren’t I?\nThat was troubling, yet somehow encouraging at the same time. Either\nway, Dalinar realized something. Adolin was right. Elhokar—and the\nhighprinces with him—would never respond to a suggestion that they\nretreat. Dalinar was approaching the conversation in the wrong way."

Dalinar was approaching the conversation in the wrong way.\nAlmighty be blessed for sending me a son willing to speak his mind.\n“Perhaps you are right, Your Majesty,” Dalinar said. “End the war?\nLeave a battlefield with an enemy still in control? That would shame us.”\nElhokar nodded in agreement. “I’m glad you see sense.”\n“But something does have to change. We need a better way to fight.”\n“Sadeas has a better way already. I spoke of his bridges to you. They\nwork so well, and he’s captured so many gemhearts.”\n“Gemhearts are meaningless,” Dalinar said. “All of this is meaningless\nif we don’t find a way to get the vengeance we all want. You can’t tell me\nyou enjoy watching the highprinces squabble, practically ignoring our real\npurpose in being here.”\nElhokar fell silent, looking displeased.\nUnite them. He remembered those words, booming in his head.\n“Elhokar,” he said, an idea occurring to him. “Do you remember what\nSadeas and I spoke of to you when we first came here to war? The\nspecialization of the highprinces?”\n“Yes,” Elhokar said. In the distant past, each of the ten highprinces in\nAlethkar had been given a specific charge for the governing of the kingdom.\nOne had been the ultimate law in regard to merchants, and his troops had\npatrolled the roadways of all ten princedoms. Another had administrated\njudges and magistrates.\nGavilar had been very taken by the idea. He claimed it was a clever\ndevice, meant to force the highprinces to work together. Once, this system\nhad forced them to submit to one another’s authority. Things hadn’t been\ndone that way in centuries, ever since the fragmenting of Alethkar into\nten autonomous princedoms.\n“Elhokar, what if you named me Highprince of War?” Dalinar asked.\nElhokar didn’t laugh; that was a good sign. “I thought you and Sadeas\ndecided that the others would revolt if we tried something like that.”\n“Perhaps I was wrong about that too.”\nElhokar appeared to consider it. Finally, the king shook his head. “No.\nThey barely accept my leadership. If I did something like this, they’d\nassassinate me.”\n“I’d protect you.”\n“Bah. You don’t even take the present threats on my life seriously.”\nDalinar sighed. “Your Majesty, I do take threats to your life seriously.\nMy scribes and attendants are looking into the strap.”\n“And what have they discovered?”\n“Well, so far we have nothing conclusive. Nobody has taken credit for\ntrying to kill you, even in rumor. Nobody saw anything suspicious. But\nAdolin is speaking with leatherworkers. Perhaps he’ll bring something\nmore substantial.”\n“It was cut, Uncle.”\n“We will see.”\n“You don’t believe me,” Elhokar said, face growing red. “You should\nbe trying to find out what the assassins’ plan was, rather than pestering me\nwith some arrogant quest to become overlord of the entire army!”"

Dalinar thought. He’s getting worse.\nElhokar’s expression softened a moment later, and he seemed to relax.\nWhatever he’d seen in Dalinar’s eyes had comforted him. “I know you try\nfor the best, Uncle,” Elhokar said. “But you have to admit that you’ve been\nerratic lately. The way you react to storms, your infatuation with my\nfather’s last words—”\n“I’m trying to understand him.”\n“He grew weak at the end,” Elhokar said. “Everyone knows it. I won’t\nrepeat his mistakes, and you should avoid them as well—rather than\nlistening to a book that claims that lighteyes should be the slaves of the\ndarkeyes.”\n“That’s not what it says,” Dalinar said. “It has been misinterpreted. It’s\nmostly just a collection of stories which teach that a leader should serve\nthose he leads.”\n“Bah. It was written by the Lost Radiants!”\n“They didn’t write it. It was their inspiration. Nohadon, an ordinary\nman, was its author.”\nElhokar glanced at him, raising an eyebrow. See, it seemed to say. You\ndefend it. “You are growing weak, Uncle. I will not exploit that weakness.\nBut others will.”\n“I am not getting weak.” Yet again, Dalinar forced himself to be calm.\n“This conversation has gone off the path. The highprinces need a single\nleader to force them to work together. I vow that if you name me\nHighprince of War, I will see you protected.”\n“As you saw my father protected?”\nDalinar’s mouth snapped shut.\nElhokar turned away. “I should not have said that. It was uncalled for.”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “No, it was one of the truest things you have said\nto me, Elhokar. Perhaps you are right to distrust my protection.”\nElhokar glanced at him, curious. “Why do you react that way?”\n“What way?”\n“Once, if someone had said that to you, you’d have summoned your\nBlade and demanded a duel! Now you agree with them instead.”\n“I—”\n“My father started refusing duels, near the end.” Elhokar tapped on the\nrailing. “I see why you feel the need for a Highprince of War, and you may\nhave a point. But the others very much like the present arrangement.”\n“Because it is comfortable to them. If we are going to win, we will\nneed to upset them.” Dalinar stepped forward. “Elhokar, maybe it’s been\nlong enough. Six years ago, naming a Highprince of War might well have\nbeen a mistake. But now? We know one another better, and we’ve been\nworking united against the Parshendi. Perhaps it is time to take the next\nstep.”\n“Perhaps,” the king said. “You think they are ready? I’ll let you prove"

If you can show me that they are willing to work with you, Uncle,\nthen I’ll consider naming you Highprince of War. Is that satisfactory?”\nIt was a solid compromise. “Very well.”\n“Good,” the king said, standing up. “Then let us part for now. It is\ngrowing late, and I have yet to hear what Ruthar wishes of me.”\nDalinar nodded his farewell, walking back through the king’s\nchambers, Renarin trailing him.\nThe more he considered, the more he felt that this was the right thing\nto do. Retreating would not work with the Alethi, particularly not with their\ncurrent mind-set. But if he could shock them out of their complacency,\nforce them to adopt a more aggressive strategy…\nHe was still lost in thought considering that as they left the king’s\npalace and made their way down the ramps to where their horses waited. He\nclimbed astride Gallant, nodding his thanks to the groom who had cared for\nthe Ryshadium. The horse had recovered from his fall during the hunt, his\nleg solid and hale.\nIt was a short distance back to Dalinar’s warcamp, and they rode in\nsilence. Which of the highprinces should I approach first? Dalinar thought.\nSadeas?\nNo. No, he and Sadeas were already seen working together too often.\nIf the other highprinces began to smell a stronger alliance, it would drive\nthem to turn against him. Best that he approach less powerful highprinces\nfirst and see if he could get them to work with him in some way. A joint\nplateau assault, perhaps?\nHe’d have to approach Sadeas eventually. He didn’t relish the thought.\nThings were always so much easier when the two of them could work at a\nsafe distance from one another. He—\n“Father,” Renarin said. He sounded dismayed.\nDalinar sat upright, looking around, hand going for his side sword\neven while he prepared to summon his Shardblade. Renarin pointed.\nEastward. Stormward.\nThe horizon was growing dark.\n“Was there supposed to be a highstorm today?” Dalinar asked,\nalarmed.\n“Elthebar said it was unlikely,” Renarin said. “But he’s been wrong\nbefore.”\nEveryone could be wrong about highstorms. They could be predicted,\nbut it was never an exact science. Dalinar narrowed his eyes, heart\nthumping. Yes, he could sense the signs now. The dust picking up, the\nscents changing. It was evening, but there should still be more light left.\nInstead, it was rapidly growing darker and darker. The very air felt more\nfrantic.\n“Should we go to Aladar’s camp?” Renarin said, pointing. They were\nnearest Highprince Aladar’s warcamp, and perhaps only a quarter-hour ride\nfrom the rim of Dalinar’s own.\nAladar’s men would take him in. Nobody would forbid shelter to a\nhighprince during a storm. But Dalinar shuddered, thinking of spending a\nhighstorm trapped in an unfamiliar place, surrounded by another"

But Dalinar shuddered, thinking of spending a\nhighstorm trapped in an unfamiliar place, surrounded by another\nhighprince’s attendants. They would see him during an episode. Once that\nhappened, the rumors would spread like arrows above a battlefield.\n“We ride!” he called, kicking Gallant into motion. Renarin and the\nguardsmen fell in behind him, hooves a thunder to precurse the coming\nhighstorm. Dalinar leaned low, tense. The grey sky grew clotted with dust\nand leaves blown ahead of the stormwall and the air grew dense with humid\nanticipation. The horizon burgeoned with thickening clouds. Dalinar and\nthe others galloped past Aladar’s perimeter guards, who bustled with\nactivity, holding their coats or cloaks against the wind.\n“Father?” Renarin called from behind. “Are you—”\n“We have time!” Dalinar shouted.\nThey eventually reached the jagged wall of the Kholin warcamp. Here,\nthe remaining soldiers wore blue and white and saluted. Most had already\nretreated to their enclosures. He had to slow Gallant to get through the\ncheckpoint. However, it would just be another short gallop to his quarters.\nHe turned Gallant, preparing to go.\n“Father!” Renarin said, pointing eastward.\nThe stormwall hung like a curtain in the air, speeding toward the camp.\nThe massive sheet of rain was a silvery grey, the clouds above onyx black,\nlit from within by occasional flashes of lightning. The guards who had\nsaluted him were hurrying to a nearby bunker.\n“We can make it,” Dalinar said. “We—”\n“Father!” Renarin said, riding up beside him and catching his arm.\n“I’m sorry.”\nThe wind whipped at them, and Dalinar gritted his teeth, looking at his\nson. Renarin’s spectacled eyes were wide with concern.\nDalinar glanced at the stormwall again. It was only moments away.\nHe’s right.\nHe handed Gallant’s reins to an anxious soldier, who took the reins of\nRenarin’s mount as well, and the two of them dismounted. The groom\nrushed away, towing the horses into a stone stable. Dalinar almost followed\n—there would be fewer people to watch him in a stable—but a nearby\nbarrack had the door open, and those inside waved anxiously. That would\nbe safer.\nResigned, Dalinar joined Renarin, dashing to the stone-walled barrack.\nThe soldiers made room for them; there was a group of servants packed\ninside as well. In Dalinar’s camp, no one was forced to weather the\ntempests in stormtents or flimsy wooden shacks, and nobody had to pay for\nprotection inside stone structures.\nThe occupants seemed shocked to see their highprince and his son step\nin; several paled as the door thumped shut. Their only light was from a few\ngarnets mounted on the walls. Someone coughed, and outside a scattering\nof windblown rock chips sprayed against the building. Dalinar tried to\nignore the uncomfortable eyes around him. Wind howled outside. Perhaps\nnothing would happen. Perhaps this time—\nThe storm hit.\nIt began."

The stuffy, dimly lit barrack was gone. Instead, he stood in\ndarkness. The air was thick with the scent of dried grain, and when he\nreached out with his left hand, he felt a wooden wall. He was in a barn of\nsome sort.\nThe cool night was still and crisp; there was no sign of a storm. He felt\ncarefully at his side. His side sword was gone, as was his uniform. Instead,\nhe wore a homespun belted tunic and a pair of sandals. It was the type of\nclothing he’d seen depicted on ancient statues.\nStormwinds, where have you sent me this time? Each of the visions\nwas different. This would be the twelfth one he’d seen. Only twelve? he\nthought. It seemed like so many more, but this had only begun happening to\nhim a few months ago.\nSomething moved in the darkness. He flinched in surprise as\nsomething living pressed against him. He nearly struck it, but froze when he\nheard it whimper. He carefully lowered his arm, feeling the figure’s back.\nSlight and small—a child. She was quivering.\n“Father.” Her voice trembled. “Father, what is happening?” As usual,\nhe was being seen as someone of this place and time. The girl clutched him,\nobviously terrified. It was too dark to see the fearspren he suspected were\nclimbing up through the ground.\nDalinar rested his hand on her back. “Hush. It will be all right.” It\nseemed the right thing to say.\n“Mother…”\n“She will be fine.”\nThe girl huddled more closely against him in the black room. He\nremained still. Something felt wrong. The building creaked in the wind. It\nwasn’t well built; the plank beneath Dalinar’s hand was loose, and he was\ntempted to push it free so he could peek out. But the stillness, the terrified\nchild…There was an oddly putrid scent in the air.\nSomething scratched, ever so softly, at the barn’s far wall. Like a\nfinger-nail being drawn across a wooden tabletop.\nThe girl whimpered, and the scraping sound stopped. Dalinar held his\nbreath, heart beating furiously. Instinctively, he held his hand out to\nsummon his Shardblade, but nothing happened. It would never come during\nthe visions.\nThe far wall of the building exploded inward.\nSplintered wood flew through the darkness as a large shape burst in.\nLit only by moonglow and starlight from outside, the black thing was\nbigger than an axehound. He couldn’t make out details, but it seemed to\nhave an unnatural wrongness to its form.\nThe girl screamed, and Dalinar cursed, grabbing her with one arm and\nrolling to the side as the black thing leaped for them.

Salas’s violet light\nshone in the sky outside, but the small moon wasn’t bright enough to\nilluminate the barn’s interior, and the creature had moved into a shadowed\nrecess. He couldn’t see much of it.\nIt seemed part of the shadows. Dalinar tensed, fists forward. It made a\nsoft wheezing noise, eerie and faintly reminiscent of rhythmic whispering.\nBreathing? Dalinar thought. No. It’s sniffing for us.\nThe thing darted forward. Dalinar whipped a hand to the side and\ngrabbed one of the grain sacks, pulling it in front of himself. The beast\nstruck the sack, its teeth ripping into it, and Dalinar pulled, tearing the\ncoarse fabric and flinging a fragrant cloud of dusty lavis grain into the air.\nThen he stepped to the side and kicked the beast as hard as he could.\nThe creature felt too soft under his foot, as if he’d kicked a waterskin.\nThe blow knocked it to the ground, and it made a hissing sound. Dalinar\nflung the bag and its remaining contents upward, filling the air with more\ndried lavis and dust.\nThe beast scrambled to its feet and twisted around, smooth skin\nreflecting moonlight. It seemed disoriented. Whatever it was, it hunted by\nsmell, and the dust in the air confused it. Dalinar grabbed the girl and threw\nher over his shoulder, then dashed past the confused creature, barreling\nthrough the hole in the broken wall.\nHe burst out into violet moonlight. He was in a small lait—a wide rift\nin the stone with good enough drainage to avoid flooding and a high stone\noutcropping to break the highstorms. In this case, the eastern rock formation\nwas shaped like an enormous wave, creating shelter for a small village.\nThat explained the flimsiness of the barn. Lights flickered here and\nthere across the hollow, indicating a settlement of several dozen homes. He\nwas on the outskirts. There was a hogpen to Dalinar’s right, distant homes\nto his left, and just ahead—nestled against the rock hill—was a midsized\nfarm house. It was built in an archaic style, with crem bricks for walls.\nHis decision was easy. The thing had moved quickly, like a predator.\nDalinar wouldn’t outrun it, so he charged toward the farm house. The sound\nof the beast breaking out through the barn wall came from behind. Dalinar\nreached the home, but the front door was barred. Dalinar cursed loudly,\npounding on it.\nClaws scraped on stone from behind as the thing bounded toward\nthem.

He glanced back over his shoulder. The\nbuilding’s floor was simple stone and there was no second story. A fireless\nbrick hearth was set on one side, with a rough-cast iron pot hanging above\nit. It all looked so primitive. What year was this?\nIt’s just a vision, he thought. A waking dream.\nWhy did it feel so real, then?\nHe looked back out the window. It was silent outside. A twin row of\nrockbuds grew on the right side of the yard, probably curnips or some other\nkind of vegetable. Moonlight reflected off the smooth ground. Where was\nthe creature? Had it—\nSomething slick-skinned and black leapt up from below and crashed\nagainst the window. It shattered the frame, and Dalinar cursed, falling as the\nthing landed on him. Something sharp slashed his face, cutting open his\ncheek, spilling blood across his skin.\nThe girl screamed again.\n“Light!” Dalinar bellowed. “Get me light!” He slammed his fist into\nthe side of the creature’s too-soft head, using his other arm to push back a\nclawed paw. His cheek burned with pain, and something raked his side,\nslashing his tunic and cutting his skin.\nWith a heave he threw the creature off him. It crashed against the wall,\nand he rolled to his feet, gasping. As the beast righted itself in the dark\nroom, Dalinar scrambled away, old instincts kicking in, pain evaporating as\nthe battle Thrill surged through him. He needed a weapon! A stool or a table\nleg. The room was so—\nLight flickered on as the woman uncovered a lit pottery lamp. The\nprimitive thing used oil, not Stormlight, but was more than enough to\nilluminate her terrified face and the girl clinging to her robelike dress. The\nroom had a low table and a pair of stools, but his eyes were drawn to the\nsmall hearth.\nThere, gleaming like one of the Honorblades of ancient lore, was a\nsimple iron fire poker. It leaned against the stone hearth, tip white with ash.\nDalinar lunged forward, snatching it in one hand, twirling it to feel out its\nbalance. He had been trained in classical Windstance, but he fell into\nSmokestance instead, as it was better with an imperfect weapon. One foot\nforward, one foot behind, sword—or, in this case, poker—held forward\nwith the tip toward his opponent’s heart.\nOnly years of training allowed him to maintain his stance as he saw\nwhat he was facing. The creature’s smooth, dark-as-midnight skin reflected\nlight like a pool of tar. It had no visible eyes and its black, knifelike teeth\nbristled in a head set on a sinuous, boneless neck. The six legs were slender"

The six legs were slender\nand bent at the sides, appearing far too thin to bear the weight of the fluid,\ninklike body.\nThis isn’t a vision, Dalinar thought. It’s a nightmare.\nThe creature raised its head, clicking teeth together, and made a hissing\nsound. Tasting the air.\n“Sweet wisdom of Battar,” the woman breathed, holding her child\nclose. Her hands shook as she held up the lamp, as if to use it as a weapon.\nA scraping came from outside, and was followed by another set of\nspindly legs slinking over the lip of the broken window. This new beast\nclimbed into the room, joining its companion, which crouched anxiously,\nsniffing at Dalinar. It seemed wary, as if it could sense that it faced an\narmed—or at least determined—opponent.\nDalinar cursed himself for a fool, raising one hand to his side to stanch\nthe blood. He knew, logically, that he was really back in the barrack with\nRenarin. This was all happening in his mind; there was no need for him to\nfight.\nBut every instinct, every shred of honor he had, drove him to step to\nthe side, placing himself between the woman and the beasts. Vision,\nmemory, or delusion, he could not stand aside.\n“Heb,” the woman said, her voice nervous. Who did she see him as?\nHer husband? A farmhand? “Don’t be a fool! You don’t know how—”\nThe beasts attacked. Dalinar leapt forward—remaining in motion was\nthe essence of Smokestance—and spun between the creatures, striking to\nthe side with his poker. He hit the one on the left, ripping a gash in its too-\nsmooth skin.\nThe wound bled smoke.\nMoving behind the creatures, Dalinar swung again, sweeping low at\nthe feet of the unwounded beast, knocking it off balance. With the follow-\nthrough, he slammed the side of the poker into the face of the wounded\nbeast as it turned and snapped at him.\nThe old Thrill, the sense of battle, consumed him. It did not enrage\nhim, as it did some men, but everything seemed to become clearer, crisper.\nHis muscles moved easily; he breathed more deeply. He came alive.\nHe leaped backward as the creatures pressed at him. With a kick, he\nknocked over the table, tumbling it at one of the beasts. He drove the poker\nat the open maw of the other. As he had hoped, the inside of its mouth was\nsensitive. The creature let out a pained hiss and scrambled back.\nDalinar moved to the overturned table and kicked off one of the legs.\nHe scooped it up, falling into Smokestance’s sword-and-knife form. He\nused the wooden leg to fend off one creature while he thrust three times at\nthe face of the other, ripping a gash in its cheek that bled smoke; it came out\nas a hiss.\nThere were distant screams outside. Blood of my fathers, he thought.\nThese aren’t the only two. He needed to be done, and quickly. If the fight"

If the fight\ndragged on, they’d wear him down faster than he wore them down. Who\neven knew if beasts like this got tired?\nBellowing, he jumped forward. Sweat streamed from his forehead, and\nthe room seemed to grow just faintly darker. Or, no, more focused. Just him\nand the beasts. The only wind was that of his weapons spinning, the only\nsound that of his feet hitting the floor, the only vibration that of his heart\nthumping.\nHis sudden whirlwind of blows shocked the creatures. He smashed the\ntable leg against one, forcing it back, then threw himself at the other one,\nearning a rake of the claws against his arm as he rammed the poker into the\nbeast’s chest. The skin resisted at first, but then broke, his poker moving\nthrough easily after that.\nA powerful jet of smoke burst out around Dalinar’s hand. He pulled his\narm free, and the creature stumbled back, legs growing thinner, body\ndeflating like a leaking wineskin.\nHe knew he’d exposed himself in attacking. There was nothing to do\nbut throw his arm up as the other beast leapt on him, slashing his forehead\nand his arm, biting his shoulder. Dalinar screamed, slamming the table leg\nagain and again at the beast’s head. He tried forcing the creature back, but it\nwas terribly strong.\nSo Dalinar let himself slip to the ground and kicked upward, tossing\nthe beast over his head. The fangs ripped free of Dalinar’s shoulder with a\nspray of blood. The beast hit the floor in a mess of black legs.\nDizzy, Dalinar forced himself to his feet and fell into his stance.\nAlways keep the stance. The creature got to its feet at about the same time,\nand Dalinar ignored the pain, ignored the blood, letting the Thrill give him\nfocus. He leveled the poker. The table leg had fallen from his blood-slick\nfingers.\nThe beast crouched, then charged. Dalinar let the fluid nature of\nSmokestance direct him, stepping to the side and smashing the poker into\nthe beast’s legs. It tripped as Dalinar turned around, wielding his poker with\nboth hands and slamming it directly down into the creature’s back.\nThe powerful blow broke the skin, passed through the creature’s body,\nand hit the stone floor. The creature struggled, legs working in effectively,\nas smoke hissed out the holes in its back and stomach. Dalinar stepped\naway, wiping blood from his forehead, leaving the weapon to fall to the side\nand clang to the ground, still impaling the beast.\n“Three Gods, Heb,” the woman whispered.\nHe turned to find her looking completely shocked as she stared at the\ndeflating carcasses. “I should have helped,” she mumbled, “should have\ngrabbed something to hit them. But you were so fast. It—it was just a few\nheartbeats. Where—How—?” She focused on him. “I’ve never seen\nanything like it, Heb. You fought like a…like one of the Radiants\nthemselves.

He pulled off his shirt, grimacing as the pain of\nhis wounds returned. Only the shoulder was immediately dangerous, but it\nwas bad; his left arm was growing numb. He ripped the shirt in half, tying\none portion around his gashed right forearm, then wadded the rest and\npressed it against his shoulder. He walked over and pulled the poker free of\nthe deflated body, which now resembled a black silk sack. Then he moved\nto the window. The other homes showed signs of being attacked, fires\nburning, faint screams hanging on the wind.\n“We need to get someplace safe,” he said. “Is there a cellar nearby?”\n“A what?”\n“Cave in the rock, man-made or natural.”\n“No caves,” the woman said, joining him at the window. “How would\nmen make a hole in the rock?”\nWith a Shardblade or a Soulcaster. Or even with basic mining—though\nthat could be difficult, as the crem would seal up caverns and highstorm\nrains made for an extremely potent risk of flooding. Dalinar looked out the\nwindow again. Dark shapes moved in the moonlight; some were coming in\ntheir direction.\nHe wavered, dizzy. Blood loss. Gritting his teeth, he steadied himself\nagainst the frame of the window. How long was this vision going to last?\n“We need a river. Something to wash away the trail of our scent. Is there\none nearby?”\nThe woman nodded, growing pale faced as she noticed the dark forms\nin the night.\n“Get the girl, woman.”\n“‘The girl’? Seeli, our daughter. And since when have you called me\nwoman? Is Taffa so hard to say? Stormwinds, Heb, what has gotten into\nyou?”\nHe shook his head, moving to the door and throwing it open, still\ncarrying the poker. “Bring the lamp. The light won’t give us away; I don’t\nthink they can see.”\nThe woman obeyed, hurrying to collect Seeli—she looked to be about\nsix or seven—then followed Dalinar out, the clay lamp’s fragile flame\nquivering in the night. It looked a little like a slipper.\n“The river?” Dalinar asked.\n“You know where—”\n“I hit my head, Taffa,” Dalinar said. “I’m dizzy. It’s hard to think.”\nThe woman looked worried at that, but seemed to accept this answer.\nShe pointed away from the village.\n“Let’s go,” he said, moving out into the darkness. “Are attacks by\nthese beasts common?”\n“During Desolations, perhaps, but not in my life! Stormwinds, Heb.\nWe need to get you to—”\n“No,” he said. “We keep moving.”\nThey continued along a path, which ran up toward the back side of\nthe wave formation. Dalinar kept glancing back at the village. How many\npeople were dying below, murdered by those beasts from Damnation?\nWhere were the landlord’s soldiers?\nPerhaps this village was too remote, too far from a citylord’s direct\nprotection. Or perhaps things didn’t work that way in this era, this place. I’ll"

Or perhaps things didn’t work that way in this era, this place. I’ll\nsee the woman and child to the river, then I’ll return to organize a\nresistance. If anyone is left.\nThe thought seemed laughable. He had to use the poker to keep\nhimself upright. How was he going to organize a resistance?\nHe slipped on a steep portion of the trail, and Taffa set down the lamp,\ngrabbing his arm, concerned. The landscape was rough with boulders and\nrockbuds, their vines and leaves extended in the cool, wet night. Those\nrustled in the wind. Dalinar righted himself, then nodded to the woman,\ngesturing for her to continue.\nA faint scraping sounded in the night; Dalinar turned, tense.\n“Heb?” the woman asked, sounding afraid.\n“Hold up the light.”\nShe raised the lamp, illuminating the hillside in flickering yellow. A\ngood dozen midnight patches, skins too smooth, were creeping over\nrockbuds and boulders. Even their teeth and claws were black.\nSeeli whimpered, pulling close to her mother.\n“Run,” Dalinar said softly, raising his poker.\n“Heb, they’re—”\n“Run!” he bellowed.\n“They’re in front of us too!”\nHe spun, picking out the dark patches ahead. He cursed, looking\naround. “There,” he said, pointing to a nearby rock formation. It was tall\nand flat. He shoved Taffa forward, and she towed Seeli, their single-piece,\nblue dresses rippling in the wind.\nThey ran more quickly than he could in his state, and Taffa reached the\nrock wall first. She looked up, as if to climb to the top. It was too steep for\nthat; Dalinar just wanted something solid to put at his back. He stepped\nonto a flat, open section of rock before the formation and raised his weapon.\nBlack beasts crawled carefully over the stones. Could he distract them,\nsomehow, and let the other two flee? He felt so dizzy.\nWhat I’d give for my Shardplate…\nSeeli whimpered. Her mother tried to comfort her, but the woman’s\nvoice was unnerved. She knew. Knew those bundles of blackness, like\nliving night, would rip them and tear them. What was that word she’d used?\nDesolation. The book spoke of them. The Desolations had happened during\nthe near-mythical shadowdays, before real history began. Before mankind\nhad defeated the Voidbringers and taken the war to heaven.\nThe Voidbringers. Was that what these things were? Myths. Myths\ncome to life to kill him.\nSeveral of the creatures lunged forward, and he felt the Thrill surge\nwithin him again, strengthening him as he swung. They jumped back,\ncautious, testing for weakness. Others sniffed the air, pacing. They wanted\nto get at the woman and child.\nDalinar jumped at them, forcing them away, uncertain where he found\nthe strength. One got close, and he swung at it, falling into Windstance, as it\nwas most familiar. The sweeping strikes, the grace.\nHe struck at the beast, scoring it on its flank, but two others jumped at"

Claws raked his back, and the weight threw him to the\nstones. He cursed, rolling, punching a creature and tossing it back. Another\nbit his wrist, causing him to drop the poker in a flash of pain. He bellowed\nand slammed his fist into the creature’s jaw and it opened reflexively,\nfreeing his hand.\nThe monsters pressed forward. Somehow he got to his feet and\nstumbled back against the rock wall. The woman threw the lamp at a\ncreature that got too close, spraying oil across the stones and setting it\nalight. The fire didn’t seem to bother the creatures.\nThe move exposed Seeli, as Taffa fell off balance in the throw. A\nmonster knocked her down, and others scrambled for the child—but Dalinar\nleaped for her, wrapping his arms around her, huddling down and turning\nhis back on the monsters. One leaped on his back. Claws sliced his skin.\nSeeli whimpered in terror. Taffa was screaming as the monsters\noverwhelmed her.\n“Why are you showing me this!” Dalinar bellowed into the night.\n“Why must I live this vision? Curse you!” Claws raked his back; he\nclutched Seeli, back arching in pain. He cast his eyes upward, toward the\nsky.\nAnd there, he saw a brilliant blue light falling through the air.\nIt was like a star rock, dropping at an incredible speed. Dalinar cried\nout as the light hit the ground a short distance away, cracking the stone,\nspraying rock chips in the air. The ground shook. The beasts froze.\nDalinar turned numbly to the side, then he watched in amazement as\nthe light stood up, limbs unfolding. It wasn’t a star at all. It was a man—a\nman in glowing blue Shardplate, bearing a Shardblade, trails of Stormlight\nrising from his body.\nThe creatures hissed furiously, suddenly throwing themselves at the\nfigure, ignoring Dalinar and the other two. The Shardbearer raised his Blade\nand struck forward with skill, stepping into the attacks.\nDalinar lay stunned. This was unlike any Shardbearer he had ever\nseen. The Plate glowed with an even blue light, and glyphs—some familiar,\nothers not—were etched into the metal. They trailed blue vapor.\nMoving fluidly, Plate clinking, the man struck at the beasts. He\neffortlessly sheared a monster in half, flinging pieces into the night that\ntrailed black smoke.\nDalinar pulled himself to Taffa. She was alive, though her side was\ntorn and flayed. Seeli tugged at her, weeping. Need to…do something…\nDalinar thought dully.\n“Be at peace,” a voice said.\nDalinar lurched, turning to see a woman in delicate Shardplate\nkneeling beside him, holding something bright. It was a topaz entwined\nwith a heliodor, both set into a fine metal framework, each stone as big as a\nman’s hand. The woman had light tan eyes that almost seemed to glow in\nthe night, and she wore no helm. Her hair was pulled back into a bun. She\nraised a hand and touched his forehead."

She\nraised a hand and touched his forehead.\nIce washed across him. Suddenly, his pain was gone.\nThe woman reached out and touched Taffa. The flesh on her arm\nregrew in an eyeblink; the torn muscle remained where it was, but other\nflesh just grew where the chunks had been torn out. The skin knitted up over\nit without flaw, and the female Shardbearer wiped away the blood and torn\nflesh with a white cloth.\nTaffa looked up, awed. “You came,” she whispered. “Bless the\nAlmighty.”\nThe female Shardbearer stood; her armor glowed with an even amber\nlight. She smiled and turned to the side, a Shardblade forming from mist\ninto her hand as she rushed to aid her companion.\nA woman Shardbearer, Dalinar thought. He’d never seen such a thing.\nHe stood up, hesitant. He felt strong and healthy, as if he’d just\nawakened from a good night’s sleep. He glanced down at his arm, pulling\noff his makeshift bandage. He had to wipe free blood and some torn skin,\nbut underneath, the skin was perfectly healed. He took a few deep breaths.\nThen shrugged, picked up his poker, and joined the fight.\n“Heb?” Taffa called from behind. “Are you insane?”\nHe didn’t respond. He couldn’t very well just sit there while two\nstrangers fought to protect him. There were dozens of the black creatures.\nAs he watched, one landed a scraping hit on the Shardbearer in blue, and\nthe claw scored the Shardplate, digging into and cracking it. The danger to\nthese Shardbearers was real.\nThe female Shardbearer turned to Dalinar. She had her helm on now.\nWhen had she put it on? She seemed shocked as Dalinar threw himself at\none of the black beasts, slashing it with his poker. He fell into Smokestance\nand fended against its counterattack. The female Shardbearer turned to her\ncompanion, then the two of them fell into stances forming a triangle with\nDalinar, his position closest to the rock formation.\nWith two Shardbearers alongside him, the fighting went remarkably\nbetter than it had back at the house. He only managed to dispatch a single\nbeast—they were quick and strong, and he fought defensively, trying to\ndistract and keep pressure off the Shardbearers. The creatures did not\nretreat. They continued to attack until the last one was sliced in two by the\nfemale Shardbearer.\nDalinar stopped, puffing, lowering his poker. Other lights had fallen—\nand still were falling—from the sky in the direction of the village;\npresumably, some of these strange Shardbearers had landed there as well.\n“Well,” a strong voice said, “I must say that I’ve never before had the\npleasure of fighting alongside a comrade with such…unconventional\nmeans.”\nDalinar turned to find the male Shardbearer regarding him. Where had\nthe man’s helm gone? The Shardbearer stood with his Blade resting on his\narmored shoulder, and he inspected Dalinar with eyes of such bright blue,\nthey were almost white.

Were those eyes actually glowing, leaking\nStormlight? His skin was dark brown, like a Makabaki, and he had short\nblack curly hair. His armor no longer glowed, though one large symbol—\nemblazoned across the front of the breastplate—still gave off a faint blue\nlight.\nDalinar recognized the symbol, the particular pattern of the stylized\ndouble eye, eight spheres connected with two at the center. It had been the\nsymbol of the Lost Radiants, back when they’d been called the Knights\nRadiant.\nThe female Shardbearer watched the village.\n“Who trained you in the sword?” the male knight asked Dalinar.\nDalinar met the eyes of the knight. He had no idea how to respond.\n“This is my husband Heb, good knight,” Taffa said, rushing forward,\nleading her daughter by the hand. “He’s never seen a sword, far as I know.”\n“Your stances are unfamiliar to me,” the knight said. “But they were\npracticed and precise. This level of skill comes only with years of training. I\nhave rarely seen a man—knight or soldier—fight as well as you did.”\nDalinar remained silent.\n“No words for me, I see,” the knight said. “Very well. But should you\nwish to put that mysterious training of yours to use, come to Urithiru.”\n“Urithiru?” Dalinar said. He’d heard that name somewhere.\n“Yes,” the knight said. “I cannot promise you a position in one of the\norders—that decision is not mine—but if your skill with the sword is\nsimilar to your skill with hearth-tending implements, then I am confident\nyou will find a place with us.” He turned eastward, toward the village.\n“Spread the word. Signs like this one are not without import. A Desolation\nis coming.” He turned to his companion. “I will go. Guard these three and\nlead them to the village. We cannot leave them alone in the dangers of this\nnight.”\nHis companion nodded. The blue knight’s armor began to glow faintly,\nthen he launched into the air, as if falling straight up. Dalinar stumbled\nback, shocked, watching the glowing blue figure rise, then arc downward\ntoward the village.\n“Come,” the woman said, voice ringing inside her helm. She began to\nhurry down the incline.\n“Wait,” Dalinar said, hastening after her, Taffa scooping up her\ndaughter and following. Behind them, the oil was burning out.\nThe female knight slowed to allow Dalinar and Taffa to keep pace with\nher.\n“I must know,” Dalinar said, feeling foolish. “What year is it?”\nThe knight turned to him. Her helm was gone. He blinked; when had\nthat happened? Unlike her companion, she had light skin—not pale like\nsomeone from Shinovar, but a natural light tan, like an Alethi. “It is Eighth\nEpoch, three thirty-seven.”\nEighth Epoch? Dalinar thought. What does that mean? This vision had\nbeen different from the others. They had been more brief, for one thing.\nAnd the voice that spoke to him. Where was it?"

Where was it?\n“Where am I?” Dalinar asked the knight. “What kingdom?”\nThe knight frowned. “Are you not healed?”\n“I am well. I just…I need to know. Which kingdom am I in?”\n“This is Natanatan.”\nDalinar released an inhaled breath. Natanatan. The Shattered Plains\nlay in the land that had once been Natanatan. The kingdom had fallen\ncenturies ago.\n“And you fight for Natanatan’s king?” he asked.\nShe laughed. “The Knights Radiant fight for no king and for all of\nthem.”\n“Then where do you live?”\n“Urithiru is where our orders are centered, but we live in cities all\nacross Alethela.”\nDalinar froze in place. Alethela. It was the historical name for the\nplace that had become Alethkar. “You cross kingdom borders to fight?”\n“Heb,” Taffa said. She seemed very concerned. “You were the one who\npromised me that the Radiants would come protect us, just before you went\nout searching for Seeli. Is your mind still muddled? Lady knight, could you\nheal him again?”\n“I should save Regrowth for others who might be wounded,” the\nwoman said, glancing at the village. The fighting seemed to be dying down.\n“I’m fine,” Dalinar said. “Alethk…Alethela. You live there?”\n“It is our duty and our privilege,” the woman said, “to stay vigilant for\nthe Desolation. One kingdom to study the arts of war so that the others\nmight have peace. We die so that you may live. It has ever been our place.”\nDalinar stood still, sorting through that.\n“All who can fight are needed,” the woman said. “And all who have a\ndesire to fight should be compelled to come to Alethela. Fighting, even this\nfighting against the Ten Deaths, changes a person. We can teach you so that\nit will not destroy you. Come to us.”\nDalinar found himself nodding.\n“Every pasture needs three things,” the woman said, voice changing,\nas if she were quoting from memory. “Flocks to grow, herdsmen to tend,\nand watchers at the rim. We of Alethela are those watchers—the warriors\nwho protect and fight. We maintain the terrible arts of killing, then pass\nthem on to others when the Desolation comes.”\n“The Desolation,” he said. “That means the Voidbringers, right? Those\nare what we fought this night?”\nThe knight sniffed dismissively. “Voidbringers? These? No, this was\nMidnight Essence, though who released it is still a mystery.” She looked to\nthe side, expression growing distant. “Harkaylain says the Desolation is\nclose, and he is not often wrong. He—”\nA sudden screaming sounded in the night. The knight cursed, looking\ntoward it. “Wait here. Call out if the Essence returns. I will hear.” She\ndashed off into the darkness.\nDalinar raised a hand, torn between following and staying to watch\nover Taffa and her daughter. Stormfather! he thought, realizing they’d been"

She stood on the trail beside him, eyes\nlooking oddly distracted.\n“Taffa?” he asked.\n“I miss these times,” Taffa said.\nDalinar jumped. That voice wasn’t hers. It was a man’s voice, deep\nand powerful. It was the voice that spoke to him during every vision.\n“Who are you?” Dalinar asked.\n“They were one, once,” Taffa—or whatever it was—said. “The orders.\nMen. Not without problems or strife, of course. But focused.”\nDalinar felt a chill. Something about that voice always seemed faintly\nfamiliar to him. It had even in the first vision. “Please. You have to tell me\nwhat this is, why you are showing me these things. Who are you? Some\nservant of the Almighty?”\n“I wish I could help you,” Taffa said, looking at Dalinar but ignoring\nhis questions. “You have to unite them.”\n“As you’ve said before! But I need help. The things the knight said\nabout Alethkar. Are they true? Can we really be that way again?”\n“To speak of what might be is forbidden,” the voice said. “To speak of\nwhat was depends on perspective. But I will try to help.”\n“Then give me more than vague answers!”\nTaffa regarded him, somber. Somehow, by starlight alone, he could\nmake out her brown eyes. There was something deep, something daunting,\nhiding behind them.\n“At least tell me this,” Dalinar said, grasping for a specific question to\nask. “I have trusted Highprince Sadeas, but my son—Adolin—thinks I am a\nfool to do so. Should I continue to trust Sadeas?”\n“Yes,” the being said. “This is important. Do not let strife consume\nyou. Be strong. Act with honor, and honor will aid you.”\nFinally, Dalinar thought. Something concrete.\nHe heard voices. The dark landscape around Dalinar grew vague.\n“No!” He reached for the woman. “Don’t send me back yet. What should I\ndo about Elhokar, and the war?”\n“I will give you what I can.” The voice was growing indistinct. “I am\nsorry for not giving more.”\n“What kind of answer is that?” Dalinar bellowed. He shook himself,\nstruggling. Hands held him. Where had they come from? He cursed, batting\nthem away, twisting, trying to break free.\nThen he froze. He was in the barrack at the Shattered Plains, soft rain\nrattling on the roof. The bulk of the storm had passed. A group of soldiers\nheld Dalinar down while Renarin watched with concern.\nDalinar grew still, mouth open. He had been yelling. The soldiers\nlooked uncomfortable, glancing at each other, not meeting his gaze. If it\nwas like before, he’d have acted out his role in the vision, speaking in\ngibberish, flailing around.\n“My mind is clear now,” Dalinar said. “It’s all right. You can all let me\ngo.”"

You can all let me\ngo.”\nRenarin nodded to the others, and they hesitantly released him.\nRenarin tried to make some stuttering excuses, telling them that his father\nwas simply eager for combat. It didn’t sound very convincing.\nDalinar retreated to the back of the barrack, sitting down on the floor\nbetween two rolled up bedrolls, just breathing in and out and thinking. He\ntrusted the visions, yet his life in the warcamps had been difficult enough\nlately without people presuming him mad.\nAct with honor, and honor will aid you.\nThe vision had told him to trust Sadeas. But he’d never be able to\nexplain that to Adolin—who not only hated Sadeas, but thought the visions\nwere delusions from Dalinar’s mind. The only thing to do was keep going\nas he had.\nAnd find a way, somehow, to get the highprinces to work together.\nSEVEN YEARS AGO\n“I can save her,” Kal said, pulling off his shirt.\nThe child was only five. She’d fallen far.\n“I can save her.” He was mumbling. A crowd had gathered. It had been\ntwo months since Brightlord Wistiow’s death; they still didn’t have a\nreplacement citylord. He had barely seen Laral at all in that time.\nKal was only thirteen, but he’d been trained well. The first danger was\nblood loss; the child’s leg had broken, a compound fracture, and it was\nspurting red where bone had split the skin. Kal found his hands trembling as\nhe pressed his fingers against the wound. The broken bone was slick, even\nthe jagged end, wetted by blood. Which arteries had been torn?\n“What are you doing to my daughter?” Thick-shouldered Harl pushed\nthrough the onlookers. “You cremling, you storm’s leavings! Don’t touch\nMiasal! Don’t—”\nHarl broke off as several of the other men pulled him back. They knew\nthat Kal—who had been passing by chance—was the girl’s best hope. Alim\nhad already been sent to fetch Kal’s father.\n“I can save her,” Kal said. Her face was pale, and she didn’t move.\nThat head wound, maybe it…\nCan’t think about that. One of the lower leg arteries was severed. He\nused his shirt to tie a tourniquet to stop the blood, but it kept slipping.\nFingers still pressed against the cut, he called, “Fire! I need fire! Hurry! And\nsomeone give me your shirt!”\nSeveral men rushed off as Kal elevated the leg. One of the men\nhurriedly handed over his shirt. Kal knew where to pinch to cut off the\nartery; the tourniquet slipped, but his fingers did not. He held that artery\nclosed, pressing the shirt on the rest of the wound until Valama came back\nwith a candle’s flame.\nThey’d already begun heating a knife. Good. Kal took the knife,\nburning it into the wound, releasing the sharply pungent smell of scorched\nflesh. A cool wind blew across them, carrying it away.\nKal’s hands stopped shaking. He knew what to do. He moved with skill"

He moved with skill\nthat surprised even him, perfectly cauterizing, as his training took control.\nHe still needed to tie off the artery—a cauterization might not hold on an\nartery this large—but the two together should work.\nWhen he was done, the bleeding had stopped. He sat back, smiling.\nAnd then he noticed that Miasal’s head wound wasn’t bleeding either. Her\nchest wasn’t moving.\n“No!” Harl fell to his knees. “No! Do something!”\n“I…” Kal said. He’d stopped the bleeding. He’d…\nHe’d lost her.\nHe didn’t know what to say, how to respond. A deep, terrible, sickness\nwashed over him. Harl shoved him aside, wailing, Kal fell backward. He\nfound himself shaking again as Harl clutched the corpse.\nAround them, the crowd was silent.\nAn hour later, Kal sat on the steps in front of the surgery room, crying. It\nwas a soft thing, his grief. A shake here. A few persistent tears, slipping\ndown his cheeks.\nHe sat with knees up, arms wrapped around his legs, trying to figure\nout how to stop hurting. Was there a salve to take away this pain? A\nbandage to stop the flow from his eyes? He should have been able to save\nher.\nFootsteps approached, and a shadow fell on him. Lirin knelt down\nbeside him. “I inspected your work, son. You did well. I’m proud.”\n“I failed,” Kal whispered. His clothing was stained red. Before he’d\nwashed the blood free of his hands, it had been scarlet. But soaked into his\nclothing, it was a duller reddish brown.\n“I’ve known men who practiced for hours and hours, yet still froze\nwhen confronted by a wounded person. It’s harder when it takes you by\nsurprise. You didn’t freeze, you went to her, administered help. And you did\nit well.”\n“I don’t want to be a surgeon,” Kal said. “I’m terrible at it.”\nLirin sighed, rounding the steps, sitting down beside his son. “Kal, this\nhappens. It’s unfortunate, but you couldn’t have done more. That little body\nlost blood too quickly.”\nKal didn’t reply.\n“You have to learn when to care, son,” Lirin said softly. “And when to\nlet go. You’ll see. I had similar problems when I was younger. You’ll grow\ncalluses.”\nAnd this is a good thing? Kal thought, another tear trickling down his\ncheek. You have to learn when to care…and when to let go….\nIn the distance, Harl continued to wail.\nOne need only look at the aftermath of his brief visit to Sel to see proof\nof what I say.\nKaladin didn’t want to open his eyes. If he opened his eyes, he’d be awake.\nAnd if he were awake, that pain—the burning in his side, the aching of his\nlegs, the dull throb in his arms and shoulders—wouldn’t be just a\nnightmare. It would be real. And it would be his."

Every length of\nmuscle, every inch of skin. His head pounded. It seemed that his very bones\nwere sore. He wanted to lie motionless and throbbing until Gaz was forced\nto come and tow him out by his ankles. That would be easy. Didn’t he\ndeserve to do what was easy, for once?\nBut he couldn’t. To stop moving, to give up, would be the same as\ndying, and he could not let that happen. He’d made his decision already. He\nwould help the bridgemen.\nCurse you, Hav, he thought. You can boot me out of my bunk even now.\nKaladin threw off his blanket, forcing himself to stand. The door to the\nbarrack was cracked open to let in fresh air.\nHe felt worse standing up, but the life of a bridgeman wouldn’t wait\nfor him to recover. You either kept up or you got crushed. Kaladin steadied\nhimself, hand against the unnaturally smooth, Soulcast rock of the barrack\nwall. Then he took a deep breath and crossed the room. Oddly, more than a\nfew of the men were awake and sitting up. They watched Kaladin in\nsilence.\nThey were waiting, Kaladin realized. They wanted to see if I’d get up.\nHe found the three wounded where he’d left them at the front of the\nbarrack. He held his breath as he checked on Leyten. Amazingly, he was\nstill alive. His breathing was still shallow, his pulse weak and his wounds\ndire, but he was alive.\nHe wouldn’t stay that way long without antiseptic. None of the wounds\nlooked infected with rotspren yet, but it would only be a matter of time in\nthese dirty confines. He needed some of the apothecary’s salves. But how?\nHe checked the other two. Hobber was smiling openly. He was round-\nfaced and lean, with a gap between his teeth and short, black hair. “Thank\nyou,” he said. “Thank you for saving me.”\nKaladin grunted, inspecting the man’s leg. “You’ll be fine, but you\nwon’t be able to walk for a few weeks. I’ll bring food from the mess hall for\nyou.”\n“Thank you,” Hobber whispered, taking Kaladin’s hand, clutching it.\nHe actually seemed to be tearing up.\nThat smile forced back the gloom, made the aches and soreness fade.\nKaladin’s father had described that kind of smile. Those smiles weren’t why\nLirin had become a surgeon, but they were why he’d remained one.\n“Rest,” Kaladin said, “and keep that wound clean. We don’t want to\nattract any rotspren. Let me know if you see any. They are small and red,\nlike tiny insects.”\nHobber nodded eagerly and Kaladin moved to Dabbid. The youthful\nbridgeman looked just as he had the day before, staring forward, eyes\nunfocused.\n“He was sitting like that when I fell asleep too, sir,” Hobber said. “It’s"

Gives me the chills, it does.”\nKaladin snapped his fingers in front of Dabbid’s eyes. The man jumped\nat the sound, focusing on the fingers, following them as Kaladin moved his\nhand.\n“He’s been hit in the head, I think,” Hobber said.\n“No,” Kaladin said. “It’s battle shock. It will wear off.” I hope.\n“If you say so, sir,” Hobber said, scratching at the side of his head.\nKaladin stood and pushed the door open all the way, lighting the room.\nIt was a clear day, the sun just barely over the horizon. Already, sounds\ndrifted from the warcamp, a blacksmith working early, hammer on metal.\nChulls trumpeting in the stables. The air was cool, chilly, clinging to the\nvestiges of night. It smelled clean and fresh. Spring weather.\nYou got up, Kaladin told himself. Might as well get on with it. He\nforced himself to go out and do his stretches, body complaining at each\nmotion. Then he checked his own wound. It wasn’t too bad, though\ninfection could make it worse.\nStormwinds take that apothecary! he thought, fetching a ladle full of\nwater from the bridgeman barrel, using it to wash his wound.\nHe immediately regretted the bitter thought against the elderly\napothecary. What was the man to do? Give Kaladin the antiseptic for free?\nIt was Highprince Sadeas he should be cursing. Sadeas was responsible for\nthe wound, and was also the one who had forbidden the surgeon’s hall to\ngive supplies to bridgemen, slaves, and servants of the lesser nahns.\nBy the time he finished stretching, a handful of bridgemen had risen to\nget something to drink. They stood around the barrel, regarding Kaladin.\nThere was only one thing to do. Setting his jaw, Kaladin crossed the\nlumber grounds and located the plank he’d carried the day before. The\ncarpenters hadn’t yet added it to their bridge, so Kaladin picked it up and\nwalked back to the barracks. Then he began practicing the same way he had\nyesterday.\nHe couldn’t go as fast. In fact, much of the time, he could only walk.\nBut as he worked, his aches soothed. His headache faded. His feet and\nshoulders still hurt, and he had a deep, latent exhaustion. But he didn’t\nembarrass himself by falling over.\nIn his practice, he passed the other bridgeman barracks. The men in\nfront of them were barely distinguishable from those in Bridge Four.\nThe same dark, sweat-stained leather vests over bare chests or loosely tied\nshirts. There was the occasional foreigner, Thaylens or Vedens most often.\nBut they were unified in their scraggly appearances, unshaven faces, and\nhaunted eyes. Several groups watched Kaladin with outright hostility.

They’d obeyed him during the battle, after all, even going so far as to\nhelp him with the wounded. His hope was in vain. While some bridgemen\nwatched, others ignored him. None took part.\nEventually, Syl flitted down and landed on the end of his plank, riding\nlike a queen on her palanquin. “They’re talking about you,” she said as he\npassed the Bridge Four barrack again.\n“Not surprising,” Kaladin said between puffs.\n“Some think you’ve gone mad,” she said. “Like that man who just sits\nand stares at the floor. They say the battle stress broke your mind.”\n“Maybe they’re right. I didn’t consider that.”\n“What is madness?” she asked, sitting with one leg up against her\nchest, vaporous skirt flickering around her calves and vanishing into mist.\n“It’s when men don’t think right,” Kaladin said, glad for the\nconversation to distract him.\n“Men never seem to think right.”\n“Madness is worse than normal,” Kaladin said with a smile. “It really\njust depends on the people around you. How different are you from them?\nThe person that stands out is mad, I guess.”\n“So you all just…vote on it?” she asked, screwing up her face.\n“Well, not so actively. But it’s the right idea.”\nShe sat thoughtfully for a time longer. “Kaladin,” she finally said.\n“Why do men lie? I can see what lies are, but I don’t know why people do\nit.”\n“Lots of reasons,” Kaladin said, wiping the sweat from his brow with\nhis free hand, then using it to steady the plank.\n“Is it madness?”\n“I don’t know if I’d say that. Everyone does it.”\n“So maybe you’re all a little mad.”\nHe chuckled. “Yes, perhaps.”\n“But if everyone does it,” she said, leaning her head on her knee, “then\nthe one who doesn’t would be the one who is mad, right? Isn’t that what you\nsaid earlier?”\n“Well, I guess. But I don’t think there’s a person out there who hasn’t\never lied.”\n“Dalinar.”\n“Who?”\n“The king’s uncle,” Syl said. “Everyone says he never lies. Your\nbridgemen even talk about it sometimes.”\nThat’s right. The Blackthorn. Kaladin had heard of him, even in his\nyouth. “He’s a lighteyes. That means he lies.”\n“But—”\n“They’re all the same, Syl. The more noble they look, the more corrupt\nthey are inside. It’s all an act.” He fell quiet, surprised at the vehemence of\nhis bitterness. Storm you, Amaram. You did this to me. He’d been burned\ntoo often to trust the flame.\n“I don’t think men were always this way,” she said absently, getting a\nfar-off look in her face. “I…”\nKaladin waited for her to continue, but she didn’t.

He passed Bridge\nFour again; many of the men relaxed, backs to the barrack wall, waiting for\nthe afternoon shade to cover them. They rarely waited inside. Perhaps\nstaying inside all day was too gloomy, even for bridgemen.\n“Syl?” he finally prompted. “Were you going to say something?”\n“It seems I’ve heard men talk about times when there were no lies.”\n“There are stories,” Kaladin said, “about the times of the Heraldic\nEpochs, when men were bound by honor. But you’ll always find people\ntelling stories about supposedly better days. You watch. A man joins a new\nteam of soldiers, and the first thing he’ll do is talk about how wonderful his\nold team was. We remember the good times and the bad ones, forgetting\nthat most times are neither good nor bad. They just are.”\nHe broke into a jog. The sun was growing warm overhead, but he\nwanted to move.\n“The stories,” he continued between puffs, “they prove it. What\nhappened to the Heralds? They abandoned us. What happened to the\nKnights Radiant? They fell and became tarnished. What happened to the\nEpoch Kingdoms? They crashed when the church tried to seize power. You\ncan’t trust anyone with power, Syl.”\n“What do you do, then? Have no leaders?”\n“No. You give the power to the lighteyes and leave it to corrupt them.\nThen try to stay as far from them as possible.” His words felt hollow. How\ngood a job had he done staying away from lighteyes? He always seemed to\nbe in the thick of them, caught in the muddy mire they created with their\nplots, schemes, and greed.\nSyl fell silent, and after that last jog, he decided to stop his practicing.\nHe couldn’t afford to strain himself again. He returned the plank. The\ncarpenters scratched their heads, but didn’t complain. He made his way\nback to the bridgemen, noticing that a small group of them—including\nRock and Teft—were chatting and glancing at Kaladin.\n“You know,” Kaladin said to Syl, “talking to you probably doesn’t do\nanything for my reputation of being insane.”\n“I’ll do my best to stop being so interesting,” Syl said, alighting on his\nshoulder. She put her hands on her hips, then plopped down to a sitting\nposition, smiling, obviously pleased with her comment.\nBefore Kaladin could get back to the barrack, he noticed Gaz hustling\nacross the lumberyard toward him. “You!” Gaz said, pointing at Kaladin.\n“Hold a season.”\nKaladin stopped, waiting with folded arms.\n“I’ve news for you,” Gaz said, squinting with his good eye.\n“Brightlord Lamaril heard what you did with the wounded.”\n“How?”\n“Storms, boy!” Gaz said. “You think people wouldn’t talk? What were\nyou going to do? Hide three men in the middle of us all?”\nKaladin took a deep breath, but backed down. Gaz was right. “All\nright. What does it matter? We didn’t slow the army.”\n“Yeah,” Gaz said, “but Lamaril isn’t too polished on the idea of paying"

He took the matter to Highprince\nSadeas, intending to have you strung up.”\nKaladin felt a chill. Strung up would mean hung out during a\nhighstorm for the Stormfather to judge. It was essentially a death sentence.\n“And?”\n“Brightlord Sadeas refused to let him do it,” Gaz said.\nWhat? Had he misjudged Sadeas? But no. This was part of the act.\n“Brightlord Sadeas,” Gaz said grimly, “told Lamaril to let you keep the\nsoldiers—but to forbid them food or pay while they’re unable to work. Said\nit would show why he’s forced to leave bridgemen behind.”\n“That cremling,” Kaladin muttered.\nGaz paled. “Hush. That’s the highprince himself you’re talking about,\nboy!” He glanced about to see if anyone had heard.\n“He’s trying to make an example of my men. He wants the other\nbridgemen to see the wounded suffer and starve. He wants it to seem like\nhe’s doing a mercy by leaving the wounded behind.”\n“Well, maybe he’s right.”\n“It’s heartless,” Kaladin said. “He brings back wounded soldiers. He\nleaves the bridgemen because it’s cheaper to find new slaves than it is to\ncare for wounded ones.”\nGaz fell silent.\n“Thank you for bringing me this news.”\n“News?” Gaz snapped. “I was sent to give you orders, lordling. Don’t\ntry to get extra food from the mess hall for your wounded; you’ll be\nrefused.” With that, he rushed away, muttering to himself.\nKaladin made his way back to the barrack. Stormfather! Where was he\ngoing to get food enough to feed three men? He could split his own meals\nwith them, but while bridgemen were kept fed, they weren’t given an\nexcess. Even feeding one man beyond himself would be a stretch. Trying to\nsplit the meals four ways would leave the wounded too weak to recover\nand Kaladin too weak to run bridges. And he still needed antiseptic!\nRotspren and disease killed far more men in war than the enemy did.\nKaladin stepped up to the men lounging by the barrack. Most were\ngoing about the usual bridgeman activities—sprawled on the ground and\ndespondently staring into the air, sitting and despondently staring at the\nground, standing and despondently staring into the distance. Bridge Four\nwasn’t on bridge duty at all this day, and they didn’t have work detail until\nthird afternoon bell.\n“Gaz says our wounded are to be refused food or pay until they are\nwell,” Kaladin said to the collected men.\nSome of them—Sigzil, Peet, Koolf—nodded, as if this was what\nthey’d expected.\n“Highprince Sadeas wants to make an example of us,” Kaladin said.\n“He wants to prove that bridgemen aren’t worth healing, and he’s going to\ndo it by making Hobber, Leyten, and Dabbid die slow, painful deaths.” He"

We can keep those three alive if a few of you will\nsplit your meals with them. We’ll need about two dozen or so clearmarks to\nbuy the right medicine and supplies. Who has something they can spare?”\nThe men stared at him, then Moash started laughing. Others joined\nhim. They waved dismissive hands and broke up, walking away, leaving\nKaladin with his hand out. “Next time it could be you!” he called. “What\nwill you do if you’re the one that needs healing?”\n“I’ll die,” Moash said, not even bothering to look back. “Out on the\nfield, quickly, rather than back here over a week’s time.”\nKaladin lowered his hand. He sighed, turning, and almost ran into\nRock. The beefy, towerlike Horneater stood with arms folded, like a tan-\nskinned statue. Kaladin looked up at him, hopeful.\n“Don’t have any spheres,” Rock said with a grunt. “Is all spent\nalready.”\nKaladin sighed. “It wouldn’t have mattered anyway. Two of us\ncouldn’t afford to buy the medicine. Not alone.”\n“I will give some food,” Rock grumbled.\nKaladin glanced back at him, surprised.\n“But only for this man with arrow in his leg,” Rock said, arms still\nfolded.\n“Hobber?”\n“Whatever,” Rock said. “He looks like he could get better. Other one,\nhe will die. Is certain. And I have no pity for man who sits there, not doing\nanything. But for the other one, you may have my food. Some of it.”\nKaladin smiled, raising a hand and gripping the larger man’s arm.\n“Thank you.”\nRock shrugged. “You took my place. Without this thing, I would be\ndead.”\nKaladin smirked at that logic. “I’m not dead, Rock. You’d be fine.”\nRock shook his head. “I’d be dead. Is something strange about you. All\nmen can see it, even if they don’t want to speak of this thing. I looked at\nbridge where you were. Arrows hit all around you—beside your head, next\nto your hands. But they weren’t hitting you.”\n“Luck.”\n“Is no such thing.” Rock glanced at Kaladin’s shoulder. “Besides, there\nis mafah’liki who always follows you.” The large Horneater bowed his head\nreverently to Syl, then made a strange gesture with his hand touching his\nshoulders and then his forehead.\nKaladin started. “You can see her?” He glanced at Syl. As a windspren,\nshe could appear to those she wanted to—and that generally only meant\nKaladin.\nSyl seemed shocked. No, she hadn’t appeared to Rock specifically.\n“I am alaii’iku,” Rock said, shrugging.\n“Which means…”\nRock scowled. “Airsick lowlanders.

Bridge Four, it lost eight runners yesterday\ncounting the three wounded.”\n“I know,” Kaladin said. “I broke my first promise. I said I wasn’t going\nto lose a single one.”\nRock snorted. “We are bridgemen. We die. Is how this thing works.\nYou might as well promise to make the moons catch each other!” The large\nman turned, pointing toward one of the other barracks. “Of the bridges that\nwere fired upon, most lost many men. Five bridges fell. They lost over\ntwenty men each and needed soldiers to help get bridges back. Bridge Two\nlost eleven men, and it wasn’t even a focus of firing.”\nHe turned back to Kaladin. “Bridge Four lost eight. Eight men, during\none of the worst runs of the season. And, perhaps, you will save two of\nthose. Bridge Four lost fewest men of any bridge that the Parshendi tried to\ndrop. Bridge Four never loses fewest men. Everyone knows how it is.”\n“Luck—”\nRock pointed a fat finger at him, cutting him off. “Airsick lowlander.”\nIt was just luck. But, well, Kaladin would take it for the small blessing\nit was. No use arguing when someone had finally decided to start listening\nto him.\nBut one man wasn’t enough. Even if both he and Rock went on half\nrations, one of the sick men would starve. He needed spheres. He needed\nthem desperately. But he was a slave; it was illegal for him to earn money\nin most ways. If only he had something he could sell. But he owned\nnothing. He…\nA thought occurred to him.\n“Come on,” he said, striding away from the barrack. Rock followed\ncuriously. Kaladin searched through the lumberyard until he found Gaz\nspeaking with a bridgeleader in front of Bridge Three’s barrack. As was\ngrowing more common, Gaz grew pale when Kaladin approached, and\nmade as if to scurry away.\n“Gaz, wait!” Kaladin said, holding out his hand. “I have an offer for\nyou.”\nThe bridge sergeant froze. Beside Gaz, Bridge Three’s leader shot\nKaladin a scowl. The way the other bridgemen had been treating him\nsuddenly made sense. They were perturbed to see Bridge Four come out of\na battle in such good shape. Bridge Four was supposed to be unlucky.\nEveryone needed someone else to look down on—and the other bridge\ncrews could be consoled by the small mercy that they weren’t in Bridge\nFour. Kaladin had upset that.\nThe dark-bearded bridgeleader retreated, leaving Kaladin and Rock\nalone with Gaz.\n“What are you offering this time?” Gaz said. “More dun spheres?”\n“No,” Kaladin said, thinking quickly. This would have to be handled\nvery carefully. “I’m out of spheres. But we can’t continue like this, you\navoiding me, the other bridge crews hating me.”\n“Don’t see what we can do about it.”\n“I tell you what,” Kaladin said, as if suddenly having a thought. “Is\nanyone on stone-gathering detail today?”\n“Yeah,” Gaz said, gesturing over his shoulder. “Bridge Three. Bussik"

Bussik\nthere was just trying to convince me that his team is too weak to go. Storms\nblast me, but I believe him. Lost two-thirds of his men yesterday, and I’ll be\nthe one who gets chewed out when they don’t gather enough stones to meet\nquota.”\nKaladin nodded sympathetically. Stone gathering was one of the least\ndesirable work details; it involved traveling outside of the camp and filling\nwagons with large rocks. Soulcasters fed the army by turning rocks into\ngrain, and it was easier for them—for reasons only they knew—if they had\ndistinct, separate stones. So men gathered rocks. It was menial, sweaty,\ntiring, mindless work. Perfect for bridgemen.\n“Why don’t you send a different bridge team?” Kaladin asked.\n“Bah,” Gaz said. “You know the kind of trouble that makes. If I’m\nseen playing favorites, I never hear an end of the complaining.”\n“Nobody will complain if you make Bridge Four do it.”\nGaz glanced at him, single eye narrowed. “I didn’t think you’d react\nwell to being treated differently.”\n“I’ll do it,” Kaladin said, grimacing. “Just this once. Look, Gaz, I don’t\nwant to spend the rest of my time here fighting against you.”\nGaz hesitated. “Your men are going to be angry. I won’t let them think\nit was me who did this to them.”\n“I’ll tell them that it was my idea.”\n“All right, then. Third bell, meet at the western checkpoint. Bridge\nThree can clean pots.” He walked away quickly, as if to escape before\nKaladin changed his mind.\nRock stepped up beside Kaladin, watching Gaz. “The little man is\nright, you know. The men will hate you for this thing. They were looking\nforward to easy day.”\n“They’ll get over it.”\n“But why change for harder work? Is true—you are crazy, aren’t you?”\n“Maybe. But that craziness will get us outside of the warcamp.”\n“What good is that?”\n“It means everything,” Kaladin said, glancing back at the barrack. “It\nmeans life and death. But we’re going to need more help.”\n“Another bridge crew?”\n“No, I mean that we—you and I—will need help. One more man, at\nleast.” He scanned the lumberyard, and noted someone sitting in the shadow\nof Bridge Four’s barrack. Teft. The grizzled bridgeman hadn’t been among\nthe group that had laughed at Kaladin earlier, but he had been quick to help\nyesterday, going with Rock to carry Leyten.\nKaladin took a deep breath and strode out across the grounds, Rock\ntrailing behind. Syl left his shoulder and zipped into the air, dancing on a\nsudden gust of wind. Teft looked up as Kaladin and Rock approached. The\nolder man had fetched breakfast, and he was eating alone, a piece of\nflatbread peeking out beneath his bowl.\nHis beard was stained by the curry, and he regarded Kaladin with wary\neyes before wiping his mouth on his sleeve. “I like my food, son,” he said."

Your loyalty. Your allegiance.”\nThe older man continued to eat. He didn’t have a slave brand, and\nneither did Rock. Kaladin didn’t know their stories. All he knew was that\nthese two had helped when others hadn’t. They weren’t completely beaten\ndown.\n“Teft—” Kaladin began.\n“I’ve given my loyalty before,” the man said. “Too many times now.\nAlways works out the same.”\n“Your trust gets betrayed?” Kaladin asked softly.\nTeft snorted. “Storms, no. I betray it. You can’t depend on me, son. I\nbelong here, as a bridgeman.”\n“I depended on you yesterday, and you impressed me.”\n“Fluke.”\n“I’ll judge that,” Kaladin said. “Teft, we’re all broken, in one way or\nanother. Otherwise we wouldn’t be bridgemen. I’ve failed. My own brother\ndied because of me.”\n“So why keep caring?”\n“It’s either that or give up and die.”\n“And if death is better?”\nIt came back to this problem. This was why the bridgemen didn’t care\nif he helped the wounded or not.\n“Death isn’t better,” Kaladin said, looking Teft in the eyes. “Oh, it’s\neasy to say that now. But when you stand on the ledge and look down into\nthat dark, endless pit, you change your mind. Just like Hobber did. Just like\nI’ve done.” He hesitated, seeing something in the older man’s eyes. “I think\nyou’ve seen it too.”\n“Aye,” Teft said softly. “Aye, I have.”\n“So, are you with us in this thing?” Rock said, squatting down.\nUs? Kaladin thought, smiling faintly.\nTeft looked back and forth between the two of them. “I get to keep my\nfood?”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said.\nTeft shrugged. “All right then, I guess. Can’t be any harder than sitting\nhere and having a staring contest with mortality.”\nKaladin held out a hand. Teft hesitated, then took it.\nRock held out a hand. “Rock.”\nTeft looked at him, finished shaking Kaladin’s hand, then took Rock’s.\n“I’m Teft.”\nStormfather, Kaladin thought. I’d forgotten that most of them don’t\neven bother to learn each other’s names.\n“What kind of name is Rock?” Teft asked, releasing the hand.\n“Is a stupid one,” Rock said with an even face. “But at least it has\nmeaning. Does your name mean anything?”\n“I guess not,” Teft said, rubbing his bearded chin.\n“Rock, this is not my real name,” the Horneater admitted. “Is just what\nlowlanders can pronounce.”\n“What’s your real name, then?” Teft asked."

Something\nglorious and daring. Has something to do with spending our afternoon\nmoving stones in the heat.”\nKaladin smiled, leaning forward. “We need to gather a certain kind of\nplant. A reed that grows in small patches outside the camp….”\nIn case you have turned a blind eye to that disaster, know that Aona\nand Skai are both dead, and that which they held has been Splintered.\nPresumably to prevent anyone from rising up to challenge Rayse.\nTwo days after the incident with the highstorm, Dalinar walked with his\nsons, crossing the rocky ground toward the king’s feasting basin.\nDalinar’s stormwardens projected another few weeks of spring,\nfollowed by a return to summer. Hopefully it wouldn’t turn to winter\ninstead.\n“I’ve been to three more leatherworkers,” Adolin said softly. “They\nhave different opinions. It seems that even before the strap was cut—if it\nwas cut—it was worn, so that’s interfering with things. The best consensus\nhas been that the strap was sliced, but not necessarily by a knife. It could\nhave just been natural wear-and-tear.”\nDalinar nodded. “That’s the only evidence that even hints there might\nbe something odd about the girth breaking.”\n“So we admit that this was just a result of the king’s paranoia.”\n“I’ll talk to Elhokar,” Dalinar decided. “Let him know we’ve run into a\nwall and see if there are any other avenues he’d like us to pursue.”\n“That’ll do.” Adolin seemed to grow hesitant about something.\n“Father. Do you want to talk about what happened during the storm?”\n“It was nothing that hasn’t happened before.”\n“But—”\n“Enjoy the evening, Adolin,” Dalinar said firmly. “I’m all right.\nPerhaps it’s good for the men to see what is happening. Hiding it has only\ninspired rumors, some of them even worse than the truth.”\nAdolin sighed, but nodded.\nThe king’s feasts were always outdoors, at the foot of Elhokar’s palace\nhill. If the stormwardens warned of a highstorm—or if more mundane\nweather turned bad—then the feast was canceled. Dalinar was glad for the\noutdoor location. Even with ornamentation, Soulcast buildings felt like\ncaverns.\nThe feast basin had been flooded, turning it into a shallow artificial\nlake. Circular dining platforms rose like small stone islands in the water.\nThe elaborate miniature landscape had been fabricated by the king’s\nSoulcasters, who had diverted the water from a nearby stream. It reminds\nme of Sela Tales, Dalinar thought as he crossed the first bridge. He’d visited\nthat western region of Roshar during his youth.

And the Purelake.\nThere were five islands, and the railings of the bridges connecting\nthem were done in scrollwork so fine that after each feast, the railings had\nto be stowed away lest a highstorm ruin them. Tonight, flowers floated in\nthe slow current. Periodically, a miniature boat—only a handspan wide—\nsailed past, bearing an infused gemstone.\nDalinar, Renarin, and Adolin stepped onto the first dining platform.\n“One cup of blue,” Dalinar said to his sons. “After that, keep to the orange.”\nAdolin sighed audibly. “Couldn’t we, just this once—”\n“So long as you are of my house, you follow the Codes. My will is\nfirm, Adolin.”\n“Fine,” Adolin said. “Come on, Renarin.” The two broke off from\nDalinar to remain on the first platform, where the younger lighteyes\ncongregated.\nDalinar crossed to the next island. This middle one was for the lesser\nlighteyes. To its left and right lay the segregated dining islands—men’s\nisland on the right, women’s island on the left. On the three central ones,\nhowever, the genders mingled.\nAround him, the favored invitees took advantage of their king’s\nhospitality. Soulcast food was inherently bland, but the king’s lavish feasts\nalways served imported spices and exotic meats. Dalinar could smell\nroasting pork on the air, and even chickens. It had been a long time since\nhe’d been served meat from one of the strange Shin flying creatures.\nA darkeyed servant passed, wearing a gauzy red robe and carrying a\ntray of orange crab legs. Dalinar continued across the island, weaving\naround groups of revelers. Most drank violet wine, the most intoxicating\nand flavorful of the colors. Almost no one was in battle attire. A few men\nwore tight, waist-length jackets, but many had dropped all pretense,\nchoosing instead loose silk shirts with ruffled cuffs worn with matching\nslippers. The rich material glistened in the lamplight.\nThese creatures of fashion shot glances at Dalinar, appraising him,\nweighing him. He could remember a time when he would have been\nswarmed by friends, acquaintances—and yes, even sycophants—at a feast\nlike this. Now, none approached him, though they gave way before him.\nElhokar might think his uncle was growing weak, but his reputation quelled\nmost lesser lighteyes.\nHe soon approached the bridge to the final island—the king’s island.\nPole-mounted gem lamps ringed it, glowing with blue Stormlight, and a\nfirepit dominated the center of the platform. Deep red coals simmered in its\nbowels, radiating warmth. Elhokar sat at his table just behind the firepit, and\nseveral highprinces ate with him. Tables along the sides of the platform\nwere occupied by male or female diners—never both at the same.\nWit sat on a raised stool at the end of the bridge leading onto the\nisland. Wit actually dressed as a lighteyes should—he wore a stiff black\nuniform, silver sword at his waist. Dalinar shook his head at the irony.\nWit was insulting each person as they stepped onto the island."

What a disaster that hairstyle is; how brave of you to\nshow it to the world. Brightlord Marakal, I wish you’d warned us you were\ngoing to attend; I’d have forgone supper. I do so hate being sick after a full\nmeal. Brightlord Cadilar! How good it is to see you. Your face reminds me\nof someone dear to me.”\n“Really?” wizened Cadilar said, hesitating.\n“Yes,” Wit said, waving him on, “my horse. Ah, Brightlord Neteb, you\nsmell unique today—did you attack a wet whitespine, or did one just sneeze\non you? Lady Alami! No, please, don’t speak—it’s much easier to maintain\nmy illusions regarding your intelligence that way. And Brightlord Dalinar.”\nWit nodded to Dalinar as he passed. “Ah, my dear Brightlord Taselin. Still\nengaged in your experiment to prove a maximum threshold of human\nidiocy? Good for you! Very empirical of you.”\nDalinar hesitated beside Wit’s chair as Taselin waddled by with a huff.\n“Wit,” Dalinar said, “do you have to?”\n“Two what, Dalinar?” Wit said, eyes twinkling. “Eyes, hands, or\nspheres? I’d lend you one of the first, but—by definition—a man can only\nhave one I, and if it is given away, who would be Wit then? I’d lend you\none of the second, but I fear my simple hands have been digging in the\nmuck far too often to suit one such as you. And if I gave you one of my\nspheres, what would I spend the remaining one on? I’m quite attached to\nboth of my spheres, you see.” He hesitated. “Or, well, you can’t see. Would\nyou like to?” He stood up off his chair and reached for his belt.\n“Wit,” Dalinar said dryly.\nWit laughed, clapping Dalinar on the arm. “I’m sorry. This lot brings\nout the basest humor in me. Perhaps it’s that muck I spoke of earlier. I do\ntry so hard to be elevated in my loathing of them, but they make it\ndifficult.”\n“Care for yourself, Wit,” Dalinar said. “This lot won’t suffer you\nforever. I wouldn’t see you dead by their knives; I see a fine man within\nyou.”\n“Yes,” Wit said, scanning the platform. “He tasted quite delicious.\nDalinar, I fear I’m not the one who needs that warning. Speak your fears at\na mirror a few times when you get home tonight. There are rumors about.”\n“Rumors?”\n“Yes. Terrible things. Grow on men like warts.”\n“Tumors?”\n“Both. Look, there is talk about you.”\n“There is always talk about me.”\n“This is worse than most,” Wit said, meeting his eyes. “Did you really\nspeak of abandoning the Vengeance Pact?”\nDalinar took a deep breath. “That was between me and the king.”"

This lot are cowards—and\nno doubt that makes them feel like experts on the subject, for they’ve\ncertainly been calling you that a great deal lately.”\n“Stormfather!”\n“No, I’m Wit. But I understand how easy a mistake that is to make.”\n“Because you blow so much air,” Dalinar growled, “or because you\nmake so much noise?”\nA wide smile split Wit’s face. “Why, Dalinar! I’m impressed! Maybe I\nshould make you Wit! Then I could be a highprince instead.” He stopped.\n“No, that would be bad. I’d go mad after a mere second of listening to\nthem, then would likely slaughter the lot. Perhaps appoint cremlings in their\nplaces. The kingdom would undoubtedly fare better.”\nDalinar turned to go. “Thank you for the warning.”\nWit sat back down on his stool as Dalinar walked away. “You’re\nwelcome. Ah, Brightlord Habatab! How thoughtful of you to wear a red\nshirt with a sunburn like that! If you continue to make my job this easy, I\nfear my mind shall become as dull as Brightlord Tumul’s! Oh, Brightlord\nTumul! How unexpected it is to see you standing there! I didn’t mean to\ninsult your stupidity. Really, it’s quite spectacular and worthy of much\npraise. Lord Yonatan and Lady Meirav, I’ll forgo an insult for you this once\non account of your recent wedding, though I do find your hat quite\nimpressive, Yonatan. I trust it is convenient to wear on your head something\nthat doubles as a tent at night. Ah, and is that Lady Navani behind you?\nHow long have you been back at the Plains and how did I not notice the\nsmell?”\nDalinar froze. What?\n“Obviously your own stench overpowered mine, Wit,” a warm\nfeminine voice said. “Has no one done my son a service and assassinated\nyou yet?”\n“No, no assassins yet,” Wit said, amused. “I guess I’ve already got too\nmuch ass sass of my own.”\nDalinar turned with shock. Navani, the king’s mother, was a stately\nwoman with intricately woven black hair. And she was not supposed to be\nhere.\n“Oh really, Wit,” she said. “I thought that kind of humor was beneath\nyou.”\n“So are you, technically,” Wit said, smiling, from atop his high-legged\nstool.\nShe rolled her eyes.\n“Unfortunately, Brightness,” Wit replied with a sigh, “I’ve taken to\nframing my insults in terms this lot will understand. If it will please you, I\nshall attempt to improve my diction to more elevated terms.” He paused. “I\nsay, do you know any words that rhyme with bescumber?”\nNavani just turned her head and looked at Dalinar with a pair of light\nviolet eyes.

The king’s mother was known as one of the most\nbeautiful women in Alethkar, though Dalinar had always found that\ndescription inadequate, for surely there wasn’t a woman on all of Roshar to\nmatch her beauty.\nFool, he thought, tearing his eyes away from her. Your brother’s\nwidow. With Gavilar dead, Navani was now to be treated as Dalinar’s sister.\nBesides, what of his own wife? Dead these ten years, wiped by his\nfoolishness from his mind. Even if he couldn’t remember her, he should\nhonor her.\nWhy had Navani returned? As women called out greetings to her,\nDalinar hurriedly made his way over to the king’s table. He sat down; a\nservant arrived in moments with a plate for him—they knew his\npreferences.\nIt was steaming peppered chicken, cut in medallions and laid atop fried\nround slices of tenem, a soft, light orange vegetable. Dalinar grabbed a\npiece of flatbread and slipped his dining knife from the sheath on his right\ncalf. So long as he was eating, it would be a breach of etiquette for Navani\nto approach him.\nThe food was good. It always was at these feasts of Elhokar’s—in that,\nthe son was like the father. Elhokar nodded to Dalinar from the end of the\ntable, then continued his conversation with Sadeas. Highprince Roion sat a\nfew seats down from him. Dalinar had an appointment with him in a few\ndays, the first of the highprinces he’d approach and try to convince to work\nwith him on a joint plateau assault.\nNo other highprinces came to sit near Dalinar. Only they—and people\nwith specific invitations—could sit at the king’s table. One man lucky\nenough to receive such an invitation sat on Elhokar’s left, obviously\nuncertain if he should join in the conversation or not.\nWater gurgled in the stream behind Dalinar. Before him, the festivities\ncontinued. It was a time for relaxation, but the Alethi were a reserved\npeople, at least when compared with more passionate folk like the\nHorneaters or the Reshi. Still, his people seemed to have grown more\nopulent and self-indulgent since his childhood. Wine flowed freely and\nfoods sizzled fragrantly. On the first island, several young men had stepped\ninto a sparring ring for a friendly duel. Young men at a feast often found\nreason to remove their coats and show off their swordsmanship.\nThe women were more modest with their displays, but they engaged in\nthem as well. On Dalinar’s own island, several women had set up easels\nwhere they were sketching, painting, or doing calligraphy. As always, they\nkept their left hands shrouded in their sleeves, delicately creating art with\nthe right. They sat on high stools, the kind that Wit had been using—in fact,\nWit had probably stolen one for his little performance. A few of them\nattracted creationspren, the tiny shapes rolling across the tops of their easels\nor tables."

A few of them\nattracted creationspren, the tiny shapes rolling across the tops of their easels\nor tables.\nNavani had gathered a group of important lighteyed women to a table.\nA servant passed by in front of Dalinar, bringing the women some food. It\nappeared to also have been made with the exotic chicken, but had been\nmixed with steamed methi fruit and covered in a reddish-brown sauce. As a\nboy, Dalinar had secretly tried women’s food out of curiosity. He’d found it\ndistastefully sweet.\nNavani placed something on her table, a device of polished brass about\nthe size of a fist, with a large, infused ruby at its center. The red Stormlight\nlit the entire table, throwing shadows down the white tablecloth. Navani\npicked up the device, rotating it to show her dinner companions its leglike\nprotrusions. Turned that way, it looked vaguely crustacean.\nI’ve never seen a fabrial like that before. Dalinar looked up at her face,\nadmiring the contours of her cheek. Navani was a renowned artifabrian.\nPerhaps this device was—\nNavani glanced at him, and Dalinar froze. She flashed the briefest of\nsmiles at him, covert and knowing, then turned away before he could react.\nStorming woman! he thought, pointedly turning his attention to his meal.\nHe was hungry, and got so involved in his food that he almost didn’t\nnotice Adolin approaching. The blond youth saluted Elhokar, then hurried\nto take one of the vacant seats beside Dalinar. “Father,” Adolin said in a\nhushed tone, “have you heard what they’re saying?”\n“About what?”\n“About you! I’ve fought three duels so far against men who described\nyou—and our house—as cowards. They’re saying you asked the king to\nabandon the Vengeance Pact!”\nDalinar gripped the table and nearly rose to his feet. But he stopped\nhimself. “Let them speak if they wish,” he said, turning back to his meal,\nstabbing a chunk of peppered chicken with his knife and raising it to his\nlips.\n“Did you really do it?” Adolin asked. “Is that what you talked about at\nthe meeting with the king two days back?”\n“It is,” Dalinar admitted.\nThat elicited a groan from Adolin. “I was worried already. When I—”\n“Adolin,” Dalinar interjected. “Do you trust me?”\nAdolin looked at him, the youth’s eyes wide, honest, but pained. “I\nwant to. Storms, Father. I really want to.”\n“What I am doing is important. It must be done.”\nAdolin leaned in, speaking softly. “And what if they are delusions?\nWhat if you’re just…getting old.”\nIt was the first time someone had confronted him with it so directly. “I\nwould be lying if I didn’t admit that I’d considered it, but there was no\nsense in second-guessing myself. I believe they’re real. I feel they’re real.”\n“But—”\n“This is not the place for this discussion, son,” Dalinar said. “We can\ntalk of it later, and I will listen to—and consider—your objections. I\npromise.”"

I\npromise.”\nAdolin drew his lips to a line. “Very well.”\n“You are right to be worried for our reputation,” Dalinar said, resting\nan elbow on the table. “I had assumed that Elhokar would have the tact to\nkeep our conversation quiet, but I should have asked him to do so directly.\nYou were right about his reaction, by the way. I realized during the\nconversation he would never retreat, so I changed to another tactic.”\n“Which is?”\n“Winning the war,” Dalinar said firmly. “No more scuffling over\ngemhearts. No more patient, indefinite siege. We find a way to lure a large\nnumber of Parshendi onto the Plains, then execute an ambush. If we can kill\na large enough number of them, we destroy their capacity to wage war.\nFailing that, we find a way to strike at their center and kill or capture their\nleaders. Even a chasmfiend stops fighting when it’s been decapitated. The\nVengeance Pact would be fulfilled, and we could go home.”\nAdolin took a long moment considering, then he nodded sharply. “All\nright.”\n“No objections?” Dalinar asked. Normally, his elder son had plenty.\n“You just asked me to trust you,” Adolin said. “Besides, striking harder\nat the Parshendi? That’s a tactic I can get behind. We’ll need a good plan,\nthough—a way to counter the very objections you yourself raised six years\nago.”\nDalinar nodded, tapping the table with his finger. “Back then, even I\nthought of us as separate princedoms. If we had attacked the center\nindividually, each army alone, we’d have been surrounded and destroyed.\nBut if all ten armies went together? With our Soulcasters to provide food,\nwith the soldiers carrying portable shelters to set up for highstorms? Over a\nhundred and fifty thousand troops? Let the Parshendi try to surround us\nthen. With the Soulcasters, we could even create wood for bridges if we had\nto.”\n“That would take a lot of trust,” Adolin said hesitantly. He glanced\ndown the high table, toward Sadeas. His expression darkened. “We’d be\nstuck out there, together and isolated, for days. If the highprinces started\nsquabbling midmarch, it could be disastrous.”\n“We’ll get them to work together first,” Dalinar said. “We’re close,\ncloser than we’ve ever been. Six years, and not a single highprince has\nallowed his soldiers to skirmish against those of another.”\nExcept back in Alethkar. There, they still fought meaningless battles\nover land rights or old offenses. It was ridiculous, but stopping the Alethi\nfrom warring was like trying to stop the winds from blowing.\nAdolin was nodding. “It’s a good plan, Father. Far better than talk of\nretreating. They won’t like giving up the plateau skirmishes, though. They\nlike the game of it.”\n“I know.

I’d still rather find a way to lure a large force of Parshendi\nout onto the Plains and meet them on one of the larger plateaus, but I\nhaven’t yet been able to figure out how to do that. Either way, our separate\narmies will need to learn to work together.”\n“And what do we do about what people are saying about you?”\n“I’ll release an official refutation,” Dalinar said. “I’ll have to be careful\nnot to make it sound like the king was in error, while also explaining the\ntruth.”\nAdolin sighed. “An official refutation, Father?”\n“Yes.”\n“Why not fight a duel?” Adolin asked, leaning in, sounding eager.\n“Some stuffy pronouncement may explain your ideas, but it won’t make\npeople feel them. Pick someone who is naming you coward, challenge\nthem, and remind everyone what a mistake it is to insult the Blackthorn!”\n“I cannot,” Dalinar said. “The Codes forbid it for one of my stature.”\nAdolin probably shouldn’t be dueling either, but Dalinar had not forced\na complete prohibition on him. Dueling was his life. Well, that and the\nwomen he courted.\n“Then charge me with the honor of our house,” Adolin said. “I’ll duel\nthem! I’ll face them with Plate and Blade and show them what your honor\nmeans.”\n“That would be the same thing as me doing it, son.”\nAdolin shook his head, staring at Dalinar. He seemed to be searching\nfor something.\n“What?” Dalinar asked.\n“I’m trying to decide,” Adolin said. “Which one has changed you\nmost. The visions, the Codes, or that book. If there’s any difference between\nthem.”\n“The Codes are separate from the other two,” Dalinar said. “They are a\ntradition of old Alethkar.”\n“No. They’re related, Father. All three. They’re tied together in you,\nsomehow.”\nDalinar thought on that for a moment. Could the lad have a point?\n“Have I told you the story of the king carrying the boulder?”\n“Yes,” Adolin said.\n“I have?”\n“Twice. And you made me listen to the passage being read another\ntime.”\n“Oh. Well, in that same section, there’s a passage about the nature of\nforcing people to follow you as opposed to letting them follow you. We do\ntoo much forcing in Alethkar. Dueling someone because they claim I’m\na coward doesn’t change their beliefs. It might stop them from making the\nclaims, but it doesn’t change hearts. I know I’m right about this. You’ll just\nhave to trust me on this as well.”\nAdolin sighed, standing. “Well, an official refutation is better than\nnothing, I guess. At least you haven’t given up on defending our honor\nentirely.”\n“I never will,” Dalinar said. “I just need to be careful. I cannot afford\nto divide us any further.” He turned back to his meal, stabbing his last piece\nof chicken with his knife and shoving it in his mouth."

His food was gone; he’d eaten the last bit\nwithout realizing it.\nHe sighed, steeling himself, and rose to greet her. “Mathana,” Dalinar\nsaid, bowing and using the formal term for an older sister. Navani was only\nthree months his senior, but it was still applicable.\n“Dalinar,” she said, a faint smile on her lips. “And dear Adolin.”\nAdolin smiled broadly; he rounded the table and hugged his aunt. She\nrested her clothed safehand on his shoulder, a gesture reserved only for\nfamily.\n“When did you return?” Adolin asked, releasing her.\n“Just this afternoon.”\n“And why did you return?” Dalinar asked stiffly. “I was under the\nimpression that you were going to aid the queen in protecting the king’s\ninterests in Alethkar.”\n“Oh, Dalinar,” Navani said, voice fond. “So stiff, as always. Adolin,\ndear, how goes courtship?”\nDalinar snorted. “He continues to change partners like he’s in a dance\nthat involves particularly quick music.”\n“Father!” Adolin objected.\n“Well, good for you, Adolin,” Navani said. “You’re too young to get\ntied down. The purpose of youth is to experience variety while it is still\ninteresting.” She glanced at Dalinar. “It isn’t until we get older that we\nshould be forced to be boring.”\n“Thank you, Aunt,” Adolin said with a grin. “Excuse me. I need to go\ntell Renarin that you’ve returned.” He hurried away, leaving Dalinar\nstanding awkwardly across the table from Navani.\n“Am I that much of a threat, Dalinar?” Navani asked, raising an\neyebrow at him.\nDalinar glanced down, realizing that he was still gripping his dining\nknife—a wide, serrated blade that could double as a weapon in a pinch. He\nlet it clatter to the table, then winced at the noise. All of the confidence he’d\nfelt speaking with Adolin seemed gone in a heartbeat.\nCompose yourself! he thought. She’s just family. Every time he spoke\nwith Navani, he felt as if he were facing a predator of the most dangerous\nbreed.\n“Mathana,” Dalinar said, realizing they were still standing on opposite\nsides of the narrow table. “Perhaps we should move to…”\nHe trailed off as Navani waved to an attending girl who was barely old\nenough to wear a woman’s sleeve. The child rushed forward, bearing a low\nstool. Navani pointed to the spot beside her, a spot only a few feet from the\ntable. The child hesitated, but Navani pointed more insistently and the child\nset the stool down.\nNavani sat gracefully, not sitting at the king’s table—which was a\nmasculine dining place—but certainly sitting near enough to be challenging\nprotocol.

At the end of the table, Elhokar noticed\nhis mother’s actions, but said nothing. One did not reprove Navani Kholin,\nnot even if one were king.\n“Oh, sit down, Dalinar,” she said, voice growing testy. “We have\nmatters of some moment to discuss.”\nDalinar sighed, but sat. The seats around them were still empty, and\nboth the music and the hum of conversation on the island were loud enough\nto keep people from overhearing them. Some women had taken to playing\nflutes, musicspren spinning around them in the air.\n“You ask why I returned,” Navani said, voice soft. “Well, I have three\nreasons. First, I wanted to bring word that the Vedens have perfected their\n‘half-shards’ as they call them. They’re claiming the shields can stop blows\nfrom a Shardblade.”\nDalinar folded his arms before him on the table. He’d heard rumors of\nthis, though he’d discounted them. Men were always claiming to be close to\ncreating new Shards, yet the promises were never fulfilled. “Have you seen\none?”\n“No. But I have confirmation from someone I trust. She says they can\nonly take the shape of a shield and don’t lend any of Plate’s other\nenhancements. But they can block a Shardblade.”\nIt was a step—a very small step—toward Shardplate. That was\ndisturbing. He wouldn’t believe it himself until he’d seen what these “half-\nshards” could do. “You could have sent this news via spanreed, Navani.”\n“Well, I realized soon after reaching Kholinar that leaving here had\nbeen a political mistake. More and more, these warcamps are the true center\nof our kingdom.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said quietly. “Our absence from our homeland is\ndangerous.” Hadn’t that been the very argument that had convinced Navani\nto go home in the first place?\nThe stately woman waved a dismissive hand. “I have determined that\nthe queen is sufficiently endowed with the requisite skills needed to hold\nAlethkar. There are schemes and plots—there will always be schemes and\nplots—but the truly important players inevitably make their way here.”\n“Your son continues to see assassins around every corner,” Dalinar\nsaid softly.\n“And shouldn’t he? After what happened to his father…”\n“True, but I fear he carries it to extremes. He mistrusts even his allies.”\nNavani folded her hands in her lap, freehand lying atop safehand.\n“He’s not very good at this, is he?”\nDalinar blinked in shock. “What? Elhokar is a good man! He has more\nintegrity than any other lighteyes in this army.”\n“But his rule is weak,” Navani said. “You must admit that.”\n“He is king,” Dalinar said firmly, “and my nephew. He has both my\nsword and my heart, Navani, and I will not hear ill spoken of him, even by\nhis own mother.”\nShe eyed him. Was she testing his loyalty?

However, unlike Jasnah, Navani was hard to trust. At least\nwith Jasnah one knew where one stood—once again, Dalinar found himself\nwishing she’d put aside her projects and return to the Shattered Plains.\n“I’m not speaking ill of my son, Dalinar,” Navani said. “We both know\nI am as loyal to him as you are. But I like to know what I’m working with,\nand that requires a definition. He is seen as weak, and I intend to see him\nprotected. Despite himself, if necessary.”\n“Then we work for the same goals. But if protecting him was the\nsecond reason you returned, what was the third?”\nShe smiled a violet-eyed, red-lipped smile at him. A meaningful smile.\nBlood of my ancestors… Dalinar thought. Stormwinds, but she’s\nbeautiful. Beautiful and deadly. It seemed a particular irony to him that his\nwife’s face had been erased from his mind, and yet he could remember in\ncomplete and intricate detail the months this woman had spent toying with\nhim and Gavilar. She’d played them off one another, fanning their desire\nbefore finally choosing the elder son.\nThey’d all known the entire time that she would choose Gavilar. It had\nhurt anyway.\n“We need to talk sometime in private,” Navani said. “I want to hear\nyour opinion on some of the things being said in camp.”\nThat probably meant the rumors about him. “I—I’m very busy.”\nShe rolled her eyes. “I’m sure you are. We’re meeting anyway, once\nI’ve had time to settle here and put out feelers. How about one week from\ntoday? I’ll come read to you from that book of my husband’s, and afterward\nwe can chat. We’ll do it in a public place. All right?”\nHe sighed. “Very well. But—”\n“Highprinces and lighteyes,” Elhokar’s suddenly proclaimed. Dalinar\nand Navani turned toward the end of the table, where the king stood\nwearing his uniform complete with royal cape and crown. He raised a hand\ntoward the island. The people hushed, and soon the only sound was that of\nthe water burbling through the streams.\n“I’m sure many of you have heard the rumors regarding the attempt on\nmy life during the hunt three days ago,” Elhokar announced. “When my\nsaddle girth was cut.”\nDalinar glanced at Navani. She raised her freehand toward him and\nrocked it back and forth, indicating that she didn’t find the rumors to be\npersuasive. She knew about the rumors, of course. Give Navani five\nminutes in a city and she’d know anything and everything of significance\nbeing gossiped about.\n“I assure you, I was never in real danger,” Elhokar said. “Thanks, in\npart, to the protection of the King’s Guard and the vigilance of my uncle.\nHowever, I believe it wise to treat all threats with due prudence and\nseriousness. Therefore, I am appointing Brightlord Torol Sadeas to be\nHighprince of Information, charging him to unearth the truth regarding this\nattempt on my life.”"

Therefore, I am appointing Brightlord Torol Sadeas to be\nHighprince of Information, charging him to unearth the truth regarding this\nattempt on my life.”\nDalinar blinked in shock. Then he closed his eyes and let out a soft\ngroan.\n“Unearth the truth,” Navani said skeptically. “Sadeas?”\n“Blood of my…He thinks I’m ignoring the threats to him, so he’s\nlooking to Sadeas instead.”\n“Well, I suppose that’s all right,” she said. “I kind of trust Sadeas.”\n“Navani,” Dalinar said, opening his eyes. “The incident happened on a\nhunt I planned, under the protection of my guard and my soldiers. The\nking’s horse was prepared by my grooms. He publicly asked me to look into\nthis strap business, and now he’s just taken the investigation away from\nme.”\n“Oh dear.” She understood. This was nearly the same thing as Elhokar\nproclaiming that he suspected Dalinar. Any information Sadeas unearthed\nregarding this “assassination attempt” could only reflect unfavorably on\nDalinar.\nWhen Sadeas’s hatred of Dalinar and his love of Gavilar conflicted,\nwhich would win? But the vision. It said to trust him.\nElhokar sat back down, and the buzz of conversation resumed across\nthe island at a higher pitch. The king seemed oblivious of what he had just\ndone. Sadeas was smiling broadly. He rose from his place, bidding farewell\nto the king, then began mingling.\n“You still argue he isn’t a bad king?” Navani whispered. “My poor,\ndistracted, oblivious boy.”\nDalinar stood up, then walked down the table to where the king\ncontinued to eat.\nElhokar looked up. “Ah, Dalinar. I suspect you’ll want to give Sadeas\nyour aid.”\nDalinar sat down. Sadeas’s half-eaten meal still sat on the table, brass\nplate scattered with chunks of meat and torn flatbread. “Elhokar,” Dalinar\nforced out, “I just spoke to you a few days ago. I asked to be Highprince of\nWar, and you said it was too dangerous!”\n“It is,” Elhokar said. “I spoke to Sadeas about it, and he agreed. The\nhighprinces will never stand for someone being put over them in war.\nSadeas mentioned that if I started with something less threatening, like\nappointing someone to Highprince of Information, it might prepare the\nothers for what you want to do.”\n“Sadeas suggested this,” Dalinar said flatly.\n“Of course,” Elhokar said. “It is time we had a Highprince of\nInformation, and he specifically noted the cut girth as something he wanted\nto look into. He knows you’ve always said you aren’t suited to these sorts\nof things.”\nBlood of my fathers, Dalinar thought, looking out at the center of the\nisland, where a group of lighteyes gathered around Sadeas. I’ve just been\noutmaneuvered. Brilliantly.\nThe Highprince of Information had authority over criminal\ninvestigations, particularly those of interest to the Crown.

In a way, it was\nnearly as threatening as a Highprince of War, but it wouldn’t seem so to\nElhokar. All he saw was that he would finally have someone willing to\nlisten to his paranoid fears.\nSadeas was a clever, clever man.\n“Don’t look so morose, Uncle,” Elhokar said. “I had no idea you’d\nwant the position, and Sadeas just seemed so excited at the idea. Perhaps\nhe’ll find nothing at all, and the leather was simply worn out. You’ll be\nvindicated in always telling me that I’m not in as much danger as I think I\nam.”\n“Vindicated?” Dalinar asked softly, still watching Sadeas. Somehow, I\ndoubt that is likely.\nYou have accused me of arrogance in my quest. You have accused me\nof perpetuating my grudge against Rayse and Bavadin. Both\naccusations are true.\nKaladin stood up in the wagon bed, scanning the landscape outside the\ncamp as Rock and Teft put his plan—such as it was—into action.\nBack home, the air had been drier. If you went about on the day before\na highstorm, everything seemed desolate. After storms, plants soon pulled\nback into their shells, trunks, and hiding places to conserve water. But here\nin the moister climate, they lingered. Many rockbuds never quite pulled into\ntheir shells completely. Patches of grass were common. The trees Sadeas\nharvested were concentrated in a forest to the north of the warcamps, but a\nfew strays grew on this plain. They were enormous, broad-trunked things\nthat grew with a westward slant, their thick, finger like roots clawing into\nthe stone and—over the years—cracking and breaking the ground around\nthem.\nKaladin hopped down from the cart. His job was to hoist up stones and\nplace them on the bed of the vehicle. The other bridgemen brought them to\nhim, laying them in heaps nearby.\nBridgemen worked across the broad plain, moving among rockbuds,\npatches of grass, and bunches of weeds that poked out from beneath\nboulders. Those grew most heavily on the west side, ready to pull back into\ntheir boulder’s shadow if a highstorm approached. It was a curious effect, as\nif each boulder were the head of an aged man with tufts of green and brown\nhair growing out from behind his ears.\nThose tufts were extremely important, for hidden among them were\nthin reeds known as knobweed. Their rigid stalks were topped with delicate\nfronds that could retract into the stem. The stems themselves were\nimmobile, but they were fairly safe growing behind boulders. Some would\nbe pulled free in each storm—perhaps to attach themselves in a new\nlocation once the winds abated.\nKaladin hoisted a rock, setting it on the bed of the wagon and rolling it\nbeside some others. The rock’s bottom was wet with lichen and crem.\nKnobweed wasn’t rare, but neither was it as common as other weeds.\nA quick description had been enough to send Rock and Teft searching with\nsome success.

The breakthrough, however, had happened when Syl had\njoined the hunt. Kaladin glanced to the side as he stepped down for another\nstone. She zipped around, a faint, nearly invisible form leading Rock from\none stand of reeds to another. Teft didn’t understand how the large Horn\neater could consistently find so many more than he did, but Kaladin didn’t\nfeel inclined to explain. He still didn’t understand why Rock could see Syl\nin the first place. The Horneater said it was something he’d been born with.\nA pair of bridgemen approached, youthful Dunny and Earless Jaks\ntowing a wooden sled bearing a large stone. Sweat trickled down the sides\nof their faces. As they reached the wagon, Kaladin dusted off his hands and\nhelped them lift the boulder. Earless Jaks scowled at him, muttering under\nhis breath.\n“That’s a nice one,” Kaladin said, nodding to the stone. “Good work.”\nJaks glared at him and stalked off. Dunny gave Kaladin a shrug, then\nhurried after the older man. As Rock had guessed, getting the crew assigned\nto stone-gathering duty had not helped Kaladin’s popularity. But it had to be\ndone. It was the only way to help Leyten and the other wounded.\nOnce Jaks and Dunny left, Kaladin nonchalantly climbed into the\nwagon bed and knelt down, pushing aside a tarp and uncovering a large pile\nof knobweed stems. They were about as long as a man’s forearm. He made\nas if he were moving stones around in the bed, but instead tied a large\ndouble handful of the reeds into a bundle using thin rockbud vines.\nHe dropped the bundle over the side of the wagon. The wagon driver\nhad gone to chat with his counterpart on the other wagon. That left Kaladin\nalone, save for the chull that sat hunkered down in its rock shell, watching\nthe sun with beady crustacean eyes.\nKaladin hopped down from the wagon and placed another rock in the\nbed. Then, he knelt as if to pull a large stone out from under the wagon.\nWith deft hands, however, he tied the reeds into place underneath the bed\nright beside two other bundles. The wagon had a large open space to the\nside of the axle, and a wood dowel there provided an excellent place for\nmounting the bundles.\nJezerezeh send that nobody thinks to check the bottom as we roll back\ninto camp.\nThe apothecary said one drop came per stem. How many reeds would\nKaladin need? He felt he knew the answer to that question without even\ngiving it much thought.\nHe’d need every drop he could get.\nHe climbed out and lifted another stone into the wagon. Rock was\napproaching; the large, tan-skinned Horneater carried an oblong stone that\nwould have been too large for most of the bridgemen to handle alone. Rock\nshuffled forward slowly, Syl zipping around his head and occasionally\nlanding on the rock to watch him.\nKaladin climbed down and trotted across the uneven ground to help."

Together they hauled the stone to the wagon and set\nit down on the bed. Rock wiped his brow, turning his back to Kaladin.\nSprouting from his pocket was a handful of reeds. Kaladin swiped them and\ntucked them beneath the tarp.\n“What do we do if someone notices this thing we are doing?” Rock\nasked casually.\n“Explain that I’m a weaver,” Kaladin said, “and that I thought I’d\nweave myself a hat to keep off the sun.”\nRock snorted.\n“I might do just that,” Kaladin said. He wiped his brow. “It would be\nnice in this heat. But best nobody sees. The mere fact that we want the reeds\nwould probably be enough to make them deny them to us.”\n“This thing is true,” Rock said, stretching and glancing upward as Syl\nzipped over in front of him. “I miss the Peaks.”\nSyl pointed, and Rock bowed his head in reverence before following\nafter her. Once she had him going in the right direction, however, she flitted\nback to Kaladin, bobbing up into the air as a ribbon, then falling down to\nthe side of the wagon and reforming her womanly shape, her dress fluttering\naround her.\n“I,” she declared, raising a finger, “like him very much.”\n“Who? Rock?”\n“Yes,” she said, folding her arms. “He is respectful. Unlike others.”\n“Fine,” Kaladin said, lifting another stone into the wagon. “You can\nfollow him around instead of bothering me.” He tried not to show worry as\nhe said it. He had grown accustomed to her company.\nShe sniffed. “I can’t follow him. He’s too respectful.”\n“You just said you liked that.”\n“I do. Also, I detest it.” She said that with unaffected frankness, as if\noblivious of the contradiction. She sighed, sitting down on the side of the\nwagon. “I led him to a patch of chull dung as a prank. He didn’t even yell at\nme! He just looked at it, as if trying to figure out some hidden meaning.”\nShe grimaced. “That’s not normal.”\n“I think the Horneaters must worship spren or something,” Kaladin\nsaid, wiping his brow.\n“That’s silly.”\n“People believe much sillier things. In some ways, I guess it makes\nsense to revere the spren. You are kind of odd and magical.”\n“I’m not odd!” she said, standing up. “I’m beautiful and articulate.”\nShe planted her hands on her hips, but he could see in her expression that\nshe wasn’t really mad. She seemed to be changing by the hour, growing\nmore and more…\nMore and more what? Not exactly humanlike. More individual.\nSmarter.\nSyl fell silent as another bridgeman—Natam—approached. The long-\nfaced man was carrying a smaller stone, obviously trying not to strain\nhimself.\n“Ho, Natam,” Kaladin said, reaching down to take the stone. “How\ngoes the work?”\nNatam shrugged.\n“Didn’t you say you were once a farmer?”"

How honest is that?”\n“That’s different. It was a joke.”\n“I fail to see how…”\nHe trailed off as another bridgeman approached. Kaladin doubted\nanyone else had Rock’s strange ability to see Syl, and didn’t want to be seen\ntalking to himself.\nThe short, wiry bridgeman had said his name was Skar, though\nKaladin couldn’t see any obvious scars on his face. He had short dark hair\nand angular features. Kaladin tried to engage him in conversation too, but\ngot no response. The man even went so far as to give Kaladin a rude gesture\nbefore tromping back out.\n“I’m doing something wrong,” Kaladin said, shaking his head and\nhopping down from the sturdy wagon.\n“Wrong?” Syl stepped up to the lip of the wagon, watching him.\n“I thought that seeing me rescue those three might give them hope. But\nthey’re still indifferent.”\n“Some watched you run earlier,” Syl said, “when you were practicing\nwith the plank.”\n“They watched,” Kaladin said. “But they don’t care about helping the\nwounded. Nobody besides Rock, that is—and he’s only doing it because he\nhas a debt to me. Even Teft wasn’t willing to share his food.”\n“They’re selfish.”\n“No. I don’t think that word can apply to them.” He lifted a stone,\nstruggling to explain how he felt. “When I was a slave…well, I’m\nstill a slave. But during the worst parts, when my masters were trying to\nbeat out of me the ability to resist, I was like these men. I didn’t care\nenough to be selfish. I was like an animal. I just did what I did without\nthinking.”\nSyl frowned. Little wonder—Kaladin himself didn’t understand what\nhe was saying. Yet, as he spoke, he began to work out what he meant. “I’ve\nshown them that we can survive, but that doesn’t mean anything. If those\nlives aren’t worth living, then they aren’t ever going to care. It’s like I’m\noffering them piles of spheres, but not giving them anything to spend their\nwealth on.”\n“I guess,” Syl said. “But what can you do?”\nHe looked back across the plain of rock, toward the warcamp. The\nsmoke of the army’s many cookfires rose from the craters. “I don’t know."

The\nsmoke of the army’s many cookfires rose from the craters. “I don’t know.\nBut I think we’re going to need a lot more reeds.”\nThat night, Kaladin, Teft, and Rock walked the makeshift streets of\nSadeas’s warcamp. Nomon—the middle moon—shone with his pale, blue-\nwhite light. Oil lanterns hung in front of buildings, indicating taverns or\nbrothels. Spheres could provide more consistent, renewable light, but you\ncould buy a bundle of candles or a pouch of oil for a single sphere. In the\nshort run, it was often cheaper to do that, particularly if you were hanging\nyour lights in a place they could be stolen.\nSadeas didn’t enforce a curfew, but Kaladin had learned that a lone\nbridgeman had best remain in the lumberyard at night. Half-drunken\nsoldiers in stained uniforms sauntered past, whispering in the ears of\nwhores or boasting to their friends. They called insults at the bridgemen,\nlaughing riotously. The streets felt dark, even with the lanterns and the\nmoonlight, and the haphazard nature of the camp—some stone structures,\nsome wooden shanties, some tents—made it feel disorganized and\ndangerous.\nKaladin and his two companions stepped aside for a large group of\nsoldiers. Their coats were unbuttoned, and they were only mildly drunk. A\nsoldier eyed the bridgemen, but the three of them together—one of them\nbeing a brawny Horneater—were enough to dissuade the soldier from doing\nmore than laughing and shoving Kaladin as he passed.\nThe man smelled of sweat and cheap ale. Kaladin kept his temper.\nFight back, and he’d be docked pay for brawling.\n“I don’t like this,” Teft said, glancing over his shoulder at the group of\nsoldiers. “I’m going back to the camp.”\n“You will be staying,” Rock growled.\nTeft rolled his eyes. “You think I’m scared of a lumbering chull like\nyou? I’ll go if I want to, and—”\n“Teft,” Kaladin said softly. “We need you.”\nNeed. That word had strange effects on men. Some ran when you used\nit. Others grew nervous. Teft seemed to long for it. He nodded, muttering to\nhimself, but stayed with them as they went on.\nThey soon reached the wagonyard. The fenced-off square of rock was\nnear the western side of the camp. It was deserted for the night, the wagons\nsitting in long lines. Chulls lay slumbering in the nearby pen, looking like\nsmall hills. Kaladin crept forward, wary of sentries, but apparently nobody\nworried about something as large as a wagon being stolen from the middle\nof the army.\nRock nudged him, then pointed to the shadowy chull pens. A lone boy\nsat upon a pen post, staring up at the moon. Chulls were valuable enough to\nwatch over. Poor lad. How often was he required to wait up nights guarding\nthe sluggish beasts?\nKaladin crouched down beside a wagon, the other two mimicking him.\nHe pointed down one row, and Rock moved off.

Kaladin pointed the other\ndirection, and Teft rolled his eyes, but did as asked.\nKaladin sneaked down the middle row. There were about thirty\nwagons, ten per row, but checking was quick. A brush of the fingers against\nthe back plank, looking for the mark he’d made there. After just a few\nminutes, a shadowed figure entered Kaladin’s row. Rock. The Horneater\ngestured to the side and held up five fingers. Fifth wagon from the top.\nKaladin nodded and moved off.\nJust as he reached the indicated wagon, he heard a soft yelp from the\ndirection Teft had gone. Kaladin flinched, then peeked up toward the sentry.\nThe boy was still watching the moon, kicking his toes absently against the\npost next to him.\nA moment later, Rock and a sheepish Teft scurried up to Kaladin.\n“Sorry,” Teft whispered. “The walking mountain startled me.”\n“If I am being a mountain,” Rock grumbled, “then why weren’t you\nhearing me coming? Eh?”\nKaladin snorted, feeling the back of the indicated wagon, fingers\nbrushing the X mark in the wood. He took a breath, then climbed under the\nwagon on his back.\nThe reeds were still there, tied in twenty bundles, each about as thick\nas a handspan. “Ishi, Herald of Luck be praised,” he whispered, untying the\nfirst bundle.\n“All there, eh?” Teft said, leaning down, scratching at his beard in the\nmoonlight. “Can’t believe we found so many. Must have pulled up every\nreed on the entire plain.”\nKaladin handed him the first bundle. Without Syl, they wouldn’t have\nfound a third this many. She had the speed of an insect in flight, and she\nseemed to have a sense of where to find things. Kaladin untied the next\nbundle, handing it out. Teft tied it to the other, making a larger bundle.\nAs Kaladin worked, a flurry of small white leaves blew under the\nwagon and formed into Syl’s figure. She slid to a stop beside his head.\n“No guards anywhere I could see. Just a boy in the chull pens.” Her white-\nblue translucent figure was nearly invisible in the darkness.\n“I hope these reeds are still good,” Kaladin whispered. “If they dried\nout too much…”\n“They’ll be fine. You worry like a worrier. I found you some bottles.”\n“You did?” he asked, so eager that he nearly sat up. He caught himself\nbefore smacking his head.\nSyl nodded. “I’ll show you. I couldn’t carry them. Too solid.”\nKaladin quickly untied the rest of the bundles, handing them out to the\nnervous Teft. Kaladin scooted out, then took two of the larger, tied-together\nbundles of three. Teft took two of the others, and Rock managed three by\ntucking one under his arm. They’d need a place to work where they\nwouldn’t be interrupted. Even if the knobweed seemed worthless, Gaz\nwould find a way to ruin the work if he saw what was happening."

Even if the knobweed seemed worthless, Gaz\nwould find a way to ruin the work if he saw what was happening.\nBottle first, Kaladin thought. He nodded to Syl, who led them out of\nthe wagonyard and to a tavern. It looked to have been hastily built from\nsecond-rate lumber, but that didn’t stop the soldiers inside from enjoying\nthemselves. Their rowdiness made Kaladin worry about the entire building\ncollapsing.\nBehind it, in a splintery half-crate, lay a pile of discarded liquor\nbottles. Glass was precious enough that whole bottles would be reused, but\nthese had cracks or broken tops. Kaladin set down his bundles, then\nselected three nearly whole bottles. He washed them in a nearby water\nbarrel before tucking them into a sack he’d brought for the purpose.\nHe picked up his bundles again, nodding to the others. “Try to look\nlike you’re doing something monotonous,” he said. “Bow your heads.” The\nother two nodded, and they walked out into a main road, carrying the\nbundles as if on some work detail. They drew far less attention than they\nhad before.\nThey avoided the lumberyard proper, crossing the open field of rock\nused as the army’s staging area before walking down the slope of rock\nleading to the Shattered Plains. A sentry saw them, and Kaladin held his\nbreath, but he said nothing. He probably assumed from their postures that\nthey had a reason to be doing what they were. If they tried to leave the\nwarcamp, it would be a different story, but this section down near the first\nfew chasms wasn’t off limits.\nBefore long, they approached the place where Kaladin had nearly\nkilled himself. What a difference a few days could make. He felt like a\ndifferent person—a strange hybrid of the man he had once been, the slave\nhe’d become, and the pitiful wretch he still had to fight off. He remembered\nstanding on the edge of the chasm, looking down. That darkness still\nterrified him.\nIf I fail to save the bridgemen, that wretch will take control again. This\ntime he’ll get his way…. That gave Kaladin a shiver. He set his bundles\ndown beside the chasm ledge, then sat. The other two followed more\nhesitantly.\n“We’re going to toss them into the chasm?” Teft asked, scratching his\nbeard. “After all that work?”\n“Of course not,” Kaladin said. He hesitated; Nomon was bright, but it\nwas still night. “You don’t have any spheres, do you?”\n“Why?” Teft asked, suspicious.\n“For light, Teft.”\nTeft grumbled, pulling out a handful of garnet chips. “Was going to\nspend these tonight….” he said. They glowed in his palm.\n“All right,” Kaladin said, slipping out a reed. What had his father said\nabout these? Hesitantly, Kaladin broke off the furry top of the reed,\nexposing the hollow center. He took the reed by the other end and ran his\nfingers down its length, squeezing it tight. Two drops of milky white liquid\ndripped into the empty liquor bottle."

Two drops of milky white liquid\ndripped into the empty liquor bottle.\nKaladin smiled in satisfaction, then squeezed his fingers along the\nlength again. Nothing came out this time, so he tossed the reed into the\nchasm. For all his talk of hats, he didn’t want to leave evidence.\n“I thought you said we aren’t throwing them in!” Teft accused.\nKaladin held up the liquor bottle. “Only after we have this out.”\n“What is it?” Rock leaned closer, squinting.\n“Knobweed sap. Or, rather, knobweed milk—I don’t think it’s really\nsap. Anyway, it’s a powerful antiseptic.”\n“Anti…what?” Teft asked.\n“It scares away rotspren,” Kaladin said. “They cause infection. This\nmilk is one of the best antiseptics there is. Spread it on a wound that’s\nalready infected, and it will still work.” That was good, because Leyten’s\nwounds had begun to turn an angry red, rotspren crawling all over.\nTeft grunted, then glanced at the bundles. “There are a lot of reeds\nhere.”\n“I know,” Kaladin said, handing over the other two bottles. “That’s\nwhy I’m glad I don’t have to milk them all on my own.”\nTeft sighed, but sat down and untied a bundle. Rock did so without the\ncomplaining, sitting with his knees bent to the sides, feet pressed together to\nhold the bottle as he worked.\nA faint breeze blew up, rattling some of the reeds. “Why do you care\nabout them?” Teft finally asked.\n“They’re my men.”\n“That’s not what being bridgeleader means.”\n“It means whatever we decide,” Kaladin said, noting that Syl had come\nover to listen. “You, me, the others.”\n“You think they’ll let you do that?” Teft asked. “The lighteyes and the\ncaptains?”\n“You think they’ll pay enough attention to even notice?”\nTeft hesitated, then grunted, milking another reed.\n“Perhaps they will,” Rock said. There was a surprising level of\ndelicacy to the large man’s motions as he milked the reeds. Kaladin hadn’t\nthought those thick fingers would be so careful, so precise. “Lighteyes, they\nare often noticing those things that you wish they would not.”\nTeft grunted again, agreeing.\n“How did you come here, Rock?” Kaladin asked. “How does a\nHorneater end up leaving his mountains and coming to the lowlands?”\n“You shouldn’t ask those kinds of things, son,” Teft said, wagging a\nfinger at Kaladin. “We don’t talk about our pasts.”\n“We don’t talk about anything,” Kaladin said. “You two didn’t even\nknow each other’s names.”\n“Names are one thing,” Teft grumbled. “Backgrounds, they’re\ndifferent. I—”\n“Is all right,” Rock said. “I will speak of this thing.”\nTeft muttered to himself, but he did lean forward to listen when Rock\nspoke.\n“My people have no Shardblades,” Rock said in his low, rumbling\nvoice."

The Selay have their\nshare of both suits and Blades. Other kingdoms, such as Herdaz, have a\nsingle Blade and set of Plate—this is passed down through the royal line.\nBut the Unkalaki, we have not a single Shard. Many of our nuatoma—this\nthing, it is the same as your lighteyes, only their eyes are not light—”\n“How can you be a lighteyes without light eyes?” Teft said with a\nscowl.\n“By having dark eyes,” Rock said, as if it were obvious. “We do not\npick our leaders this way. Is complicated. But do not interrupt story.” He\nmilked another reed, tossing the husk into a pile beside him. “The nuatoma,\nthey see our lack of Shards as great shame. They want these weapons very\nbadly. It is believed that the nuatoma who first obtains a Shardblade would\nbecome king, a thing we have not had for many years. No peak would fight\nanother peak where a man held one of the blessed Blades.”\n“So you came to buy one?” Kaladin asked. No Shardbearer would sell\nhis weapon. Each was a distinctive relic, taken from one of the Lost\nRadiants after their betrayal.\nRock laughed. “Ha! Buy? No, we are not so foolish as this. But my\nnuatoma, he knew of your tradition, eh? It says that if a man kills a\nShardbearer, he may take the Blade and Plate as his own. And so my\nnuatoma and his house, we made a grand procession, coming down to find\nand kill one of your Shardbearers.”\nKaladin almost laughed. “I assume it proved more difficult than that.”\n“My nuatoma was not a fool,” Rock said, defensive. “He knew this\nthing would be difficult, but your tradition, it gives us hope, you see?\nOccasionally, a brave nuatoma will come down to duel a Shardbearer.\nSomeday, one will win, and we will have Shards.”\n“Perhaps,” Kaladin said, tossing an empty reed into the chasm.\n“Assuming they agree to duel you in a bout to the death.”\n“Oh, they always duel,” Rock said, laughing. “The nuatoma brings\nmany riches and promises all of his possessions to the victor. Your\nlighteyes, they cannot pass by a pond so warm! To kill an Unkalaki with no\nShardblade, they do not see this thing as difficult. Many nuatoma have died.\nBut is all right. Eventually, we will win.”\n“And have one set of Shards,” Kaladin said. “Alethkar has dozens.”\n“One is a beginning,” Rock said, shrugging. “But my nuatoma lost, so\nI am bridgeman.”"

Is well known that there are many Shardbearers here on\nShattered Plains. My nuatoma thought it easier to fight man with only Plate\nfirst, then win Blade next.”\n“And?” Teft said.\n“Once my nuatoma lost to Brightlord Sadeas, all of us became his.”\n“So you’re a slave?” Kaladin asked, reaching up and feeling the marks\non his forehead.\n“No, we do not have this thing,” Rock said. “I was not a slave of my\nnuatoma. I was his family.”\n“His family?” Teft said. “Kelek! You’re a lighteyes!”\nRock laughed again, loud and full-bellied. Kaladin smiled despite\nhimself. It seemed like so long since he’d heard someone laugh like that.\n“No, no. I was only umarti’a—his cousin, you would say.”\n“Still, you were related to him.”\n“On the Peaks,” Rock said, “the relatives of a brightlord are his\nservants.”\n“What kind of system is that?” Teft complained. “You have to be a\nservant to your own relatives? Storm me! I’d rather die, I think I would.”\n“It is not so bad,” Rock said.\n“You don’t know my relatives,” Teft said, shivering.\nRock laughed again. “You would rather serve someone you do not\nknow? Like this Sadeas? A man who is no relation to you?” He shook his\nhead. “Lowlanders. You have too much air here. Makes your minds sick.”\n“Too much air?” Kaladin asked.\n“Yes,” Rock said.\n“How can you have too much air? It’s all around.”\n“This thing, it is difficult to explain.” Rock’s Alethi was good, but he\nsometimes forget to add in common words. Other times, he remembered\nthem, speaking his sentences precisely. The faster he spoke, the more words\nhe forgot to put in.\n“You have too much air,” Rock said. “Come to the Peaks. You will\nsee.”\n“I guess,” Kaladin said, shooting a glance at Teft, who just shrugged.\n“But you’re wrong about one thing. You said that we serve someone we\ndon’t know. Well, I do know Brightlord Sadeas. I know him well.”\nRock raised an eyebrow.\n“Arrogant,” Kaladin said, “vengeful, greedy, corrupt to the core.”\nRock smiled. “Yes, I think you are right. This man is not among the\nfinest of lighteyes.”\n“There are no ‘finest’ among them, Rock. They’re all the same.”\n“They have done much to you, then?”\nKaladin shrugged, the question uncovering wounds that weren’t yet\nhealed. “Anyway, your master was lucky.”\n“Lucky to be slain by a Shardbearer?”"

They wouldn’t have let him walk away with Sadeas’s Plate.”\n“Nonsense,” Teft broke in. “Tradition—”\n“Tradition is the blind witness they use to condemn us, Teft,” Kaladin\nsaid. “It’s the pretty box they use to wrap up their lies. It makes us serve\nthem.”\nTeft set his jaw. “I’ve lived a lot longer than you, son. I know things. If\na common man killed an enemy Shardbearer, he’d become a lighteyes.\nThat’s the way of it.”\nHe let the argument lapse. If Teft’s illusions made him feel better about\nhis place in this mess of a war, then who was Kaladin to dissuade him? “So\nyou were a servant,” Kaladin said to Rock. “In a brightlord’s retinue? What\nkind of servant?” He struggled for the right word, remembering back to the\ntimes he’d interacted with Wistiow or Roshone. “A footman? A butler?”\nRock laughed. “I was cook. My nuatoma would not come down to the\nlowlands without his own cook! Your food here, it has so many spices that\nyou cannot taste anything else. Might as well be eating stones powdered\nwith pepper!”\n“You should talk about food,” Teft said, scowling. “A Horneater?”\nKaladin frowned. “Why do they call your people that, anyway?”\n“Because they eat the horns and shells of the things they catch,” Teft\nsaid. “The outsides.”\nRock smiled, with a look of longing. “Ah, but the taste is so good.”\n“You actually eat the shells?” Kaladin asked.\n“We have very strong teeth,” Rock said proudly. “But there. You now\nknow my story. Brightlord Sadeas, he wasn’t certain what he should do with\nmost of us. Some were made soldiers, others serve in his house hold. I fixed\nhim one meal and he sent me to bridge crews.” Rock hesitated. “I may\nhave, uh, enhanced the soup.”\n“Enhanced?” Kaladin asked, raising an eyebrow.\nRock seemed to grow embarrassed. “You see, I was quite angry about\nmy nuatoma’s death. And I thought, these lowlanders, their tongues are all\nscorched and burned by the food they eat. They have no taste, and…”\n“And what?” Kaladin asked.\n“Chull dung,” Rock said. “It apparently has stronger taste than I\nassumed.”\n“Wait,” Teft said. “You put chull dung in Highprince Sadeas’s soup?”\n“Er, yes,” Rock said. “Actually, I put this thing in his bread too. And\nused it as a garnish on the pork steak. And made a chutney out of it for the\nbuttered garams. Chull dung, it has many uses, I found.”\nTeft laughed, his voice echoing.

He fell on his side, so amused that\nKaladin was afraid he’d roll right into the chasm. “Horneater,” Teft finally\nsaid, “I owe you a drink.”\nRock smiled. Kaladin shook his head to himself, amazed. It suddenly\nmade sense.\n“What?” Rock said, apparently noticing his expression.\n“This is what we need,” Kaladin said. “This! It’s the thing I’ve been\nmissing.”\nRock hesitated. “Chull dung? This is the thing you need?”\nTeft burst into another round of laugher.\n“No,” Kaladin said. “It’s…well, I’ll show you. But first we need this\nknobweed sap.” They’d barely made their way through one of the bundles,\nand already his fingers were aching from the milking.\n“What of you, Kaladin?” Rock asked. “I have been telling you my\nstory. You will tell me yours? How did you come to those marks on your\nforehead?”\n“Yeah,” Teft said, wiping his eyes. “Whose food did you trat in?”\n“I thought you said it was taboo to ask about a bridgeman’s past,”\nKaladin said.\n“You made Rock share, son,” Teft said. “It’s only fair.”\n“So if I tell my story, that means you’ll tell yours?”\nTeft scowled immediately. “Now look, I ain’t going to—”\n“I killed a man,” Kaladin said.\nThat quieted Teft. Rock perked up. Syl, Kaladin noticed, was still\nwatching with interest. That was odd for her; normally, her attention\nwavered quickly.\n“You killed a man?” Rock said. “And after this thing, they made you a\nslave? Is not the punishment for murder usually death?”\n“It wasn’t murder,” Kaladin said softly, thinking of the scraggly\nbearded man in the slave wagon who had asked him these same questions.\n“In fact, I was thanked for it by someone very important.”\nHe fell silent.\n“And?” Teft finally asked.\n“And…” Kaladin said, looking down at a reed. Nomon was setting in\nthe west, and the small green disk of Mishim—the final moon—was rising\nin the east. “And it turns out that lighteyes don’t react very well when you\nturn down their gifts.”\nThe others waited for more, but Kaladin fell silent, working on his\nreeds. It shocked him, how painful it still was to remember those events\nback in Amaram’s army.\nEither the others sensed his mood, or they felt what he’d said was\nenough, for they each turned back to their work and prodded no further.\nNeither point makes the things I have written to you here untrue.\nThe king’s Gallery of Maps balanced beauty and function.

The crusty, hard\nplants had no true stalks or leaves, just waving tendrils like colorful hair.\nExcept for those, shalebark seemed more rock than vegetation. And yet,\nscholars said it must be a plant for the way it grew and reached toward the\nlight.\nMen did that too, he thought. Once.\nHighprince Roion stood in front of one of the maps, hands clasped\nbehind his back, his numerous attendants clogging the other side of the\ngallery. Roion was a tall, light-skinned man with a dark, well-trimmed\nbeard. He was thinning on top. Like most of the others, he wore a short,\nopen-fronted jacket, exposing the shirt underneath. Its red fabric poked out\nabove the jacket’s collar.\nSo sloppy, Dalinar thought, though it was very fashionable. Dalinar\njust wished that current fashion weren’t so, well, sloppy.\n“Brightlord Dalinar,” Roion said. “I have difficulty seeing the point of\nthis meeting.”\n“Walk with me, Brightlord Roion,” Dalinar said, nodding to the side.\nThe other man sighed, but joined Dalinar and walked the pathway\nbetween the clusters of plants and the wall of maps. Roion’s attendants\nfollowed; they included both a cupbearer and a shieldbearer.\nEach map was illuminated by diamonds, their enclosures made of\nmirror-polished steel. The maps were inked, in detail, onto unnaturally\nlarge, seamless sheets of parchment. Such parchment was obviously\nSoulcast. Near the center of the chamber they came to the Prime Map, an\nenormous, detailed map fixed in a frame on the wall. It showed the entirety\nof the Shattered Plains that had been explored. Permanent bridges were\ndrawn in red, and plateaus close to the Alethi side had blue glyphpairs on\nthem, indicating which highprince controlled them. The eastern section of\nthe map grew less detailed until the lines vanished.\nIn the middle was the contested area, the section of plateaus where\nthe chasmfiends most often came to make their chrysalises. Few came to the\nnear side, where the permanent bridges were. If they did come, it was to\nhunt, not to pupate.\nControlling the nearby plateaus was still important, as a highprince—\nby agreement—could not cross a plateau maintained by one of the others\nunless he had permission. That determined who had the best pathways to\nthe central plateaus, and it also determined who had to maintain the watch-\nposts and permanent bridges on that plateau. Those plateaus were bought\nand sold among the highprinces.\nA second sheet of parchment to the side of the Prime Map listed each\nhighprince and the number of gemhearts he had won. It was a very Alethi\nthing to do—maintain motivation by making it very clear who was winning\nand who lagged behind.\nRoion’s eyes immediately went to his own name on the list.

Of all the\nhighprinces, Roion had won the fewest gemhearts.\nDalinar reached his hand up to the Prime Map, brushing the\nparchment. The middle plateaus were named or numbered for ease of\nreference. Foremost of them was a large plateau that stood defiantly near\nthe Parshendi side. The Tower, it was called. An unusually massive and\noddly shaped plateau that the chasmfiends seemed particularly fond of\nusing as a spot for pupating.\nLooking at it gave him pause. The size of a contested plateau\ndetermined the number of troops you could field on it. The Parshendi\nusually brought a large force to the Tower, and they had rebuffed the Alethi\nassaults there twenty-seven times now. No Alethi had ever won a skirmish\nupon it. Dalinar had been turned back there twice himself.\nIt was just too close to the Parshendi; they could always get there first\nand form up, using the slope to give them excellent high ground. But if we\ncould corner them there, he thought, with a large enough force of our\nown… It could mean trapping and killing a huge number of Parshendi\ntroops. Maybe enough of them to break their ability to wage war on the\nPlains.\nIt was something to consider. Before that could happen, however,\nDalinar would need alliances. He ran his fingers westward. “Highprince\nSadeas has been doing very well lately.” Dalinar tapped Sadeas’s warcamp.\n“He’s been buying plateaus from other highprinces, making it easier and\neasier for him to get to the battlefields first.”\n“Yes,” Roion said, frowning. “One hardly needs to see a map to know\nthat, Dalinar.”\n“Look at the scope of it,” Dalinar said. “Six years of continuous\nfighting, and nobody has even seen the center of the Shattered Plains.”\n“That’s never been the point. We hold them in, besiege them, starve\nthem out, and force them to come to us. Wasn’t that your plan?”\n“Yes, but I never imagined it would take this long. I’ve been thinking\nthat it might be time to change tactics.”\n“Why? This one works. Hardly a week goes by without a couple of\nclashes with the Parshendi. Though, might I point out that you have hardly\nbeen a model of inspiration in battle lately.” He nodded to Dalinar’s name\non the smaller sheet.\nThere were a good number of scratches next to his name, noting\ngemhearts won. But very few of them were fresh.\n“There are some who say the Blackthorn has lost his sting,” Roion\nsaid. He was careful not to insult Dalinar outright, but he went further than\nhe once would have. News of Dalinar’s actions while trapped in the barrack\nhad spread.\nDalinar forced himself to be calm. “Roion, we cannot continue to treat\nthis war as a game.”\n“All wars are games. The greatest kind, with the pieces lost real lives,\nthe prizes captured making for real wealth! This is the life for which men\nexist. To fight, to kill, to win.” He was quoting the Sunmaker, the last Alethi\nking to unite the highprinces. Gavilar had once revered his name."

Gavilar had once revered his name.\n“Perhaps,” Dalinar said. “Yet what is the point? We fight to get\nShardblades, then use those Shardblades to fight to get more Shardblades.\nIt’s a circle, round and round we go, chasing our tails so we can be better at\nchasing our tails.”\n“We fight to prepare ourselves to reclaim heaven and take back what is\nours.”\n“Men can train without going to war, and men can fight without it\nbeing meaningless. It wasn’t always this way. There were times when our\nwars meant something.”\nRoion raised an eyebrow. “You’re almost making me believe the\nrumors, Dalinar. They say you’ve lost your taste for combat, that you no\nlonger have the will to fight.” He eyed Dalinar again. “Some are saying that\nit is time to abdicate in favor of your son.”\n“The rumors are wrong,” Dalinar snapped.\n“That is—”\n“They are wrong,” Dalinar said firmly, “if they claim that I no longer\ncare.” He rested his fingers on the surface of the map again, running them\nacross the smooth parchment. “I care, Roion. I care deeply. About this\npeople. About my nephew. About the future of this war. And that is why I\nsuggest we pursue an aggressive course from now on.”\n“Well, that is good to hear, I suppose.”\nUnite them….\n“I want you to try a joint plateau assault with me,” Dalinar said.\n“What?”\n“I want the two of us to try coordinating our efforts and attack at the\nsame time, working together.”\n“Why would we want to do that?”\n“We could increase our chances of winning gemhearts.”\n“If more troops increased my chances of winning,” Roion said, “then\nI’d just bring more of my own. The plateaus are too small for fielding large\narmies, and mobility is more important than sheer numbers.”\nIt was a valid point; on the Plains, more didn’t necessarily mean better.\nClose confines and a requisite forced march to the battlefield changed\nwarfare significantly. The exact number of troops used depended on the size\nof the plateau and the highprince’s personal martial philosophy.\n“Working together wouldn’t just be about fielding more troops,”\nDalinar said. “Each highprince’s army has different strengths. I’m known\nfor my heavy infantry; you have the best archers. Sadeas’s bridges are the\nfastest. Working together, we could try new tactics. We expend too much\neffort getting to the plateau in haste. If we weren’t so rushed, competing\nagainst one another, maybe we could surround the plateau. We could try\nletting the Parshendi arrive first, then assault them on our terms, not theirs.”\nRoion hesitated. Dalinar had spent days deliberating with his generals\nabout the possibility of a joint assault. It seemed that there would be distinct\nadvantages, but they wouldn’t know for certain until someone tried it with\nhim.\nHe actually seemed to be considering. “Who would get the gemheart?”\n“We split the wealth equally,” Dalinar said.\n“And if we capture a Shardblade?”\n“The man who won it would get it, obviously.”"

In fact,\nhaving only one or the other often wasn’t enough. Sadeas had faced\nParshendi Shardbearers on the field, and had always been forced to retreat,\nlest he be slain himself.\n“I’m certain we could arrange something more equitable,” Dalinar\nfinally said. If he won Shards, he’d been hoping to be able to give them to\nRenarin.\n“I’m sure,” Roion said skeptically.\nDalinar drew in a breath. He needed to be bolder. “What if I offer them\nto you?”\n“Excuse me?”\n“We try a joint attack. If I win a Shardblade or Plate, you get the first\nset. But I keep the second.”\nRoion’s eyes narrowed. “You’d do that?”\n“On my honor, Roion.”\n“Well, nobody would doubt that. But can you blame a man for being\nwary?”\n“Of what?”\n“I am a highprince, Dalinar,” Roion said. “My princedom is the\nsmallest, true, but I am my own man. I would not see myself subordinated\nto someone greater.”\nYou’ve already become part of something greater, Dalinar thought with\nfrustration. That happened the moment you swore fealty to Gavilar. Roion\nand the others refused to make good on their promises. “Our kingdom can\nbe so much more than it is, Roion.”\n“Perhaps. But perhaps I’m satisfied with what I have. Either way, you\nmake an interesting proposal. I shall have to think on it further.”\n“Very well,” Dalinar said, but his instinct said that Roion would\ndecline the offer. The man was too suspicious. The highprinces barely\ntrusted one another enough to work together when there weren’t\nShardblades and gems at stake.\n“Will I be seeing you at the feast this evening?” Roion asked.\n“Why wouldn’t you?” Dalinar asked with a sigh.\n“Well, the stormwardens have been saying that there could be a\nhighstorm tonight, you see—”\n“I will be there,” Dalinar said flatly.\n“Yes, of course,” Roion said, chuckling. “No reason why you wouldn’t\nbe.” He smiled at Dalinar and withdrew, his attendants following.\nDalinar sighed, turning to study the Prime Map, thinking through the\nmeeting and what it meant. He stood there for a long time. Looking down\non the Plains, as if a god far above. The plateaus looked like close islands,\nor perhaps jagged pieces set in a massive stained-glass window. Not for the\nfirst time, he felt as if he should be able to make out a pattern to the\nplateaus. If he could see more of them, perhaps. What would it mean if\nthere was an order to the chasms?\nEveryone else was so concerned with looking strong, with proving"

What would it mean if\nthere was an order to the chasms?\nEveryone else was so concerned with looking strong, with proving\nthemselves. Was he really the only one who saw how frivolous that was?\nStrength for strength’s sake? What good was strength unless you did\nsomething with it?\nAlethkar was a light, once, he thought. That’s what Gavilar’s book\nclaims, that’s what the visions are showing me. Nohadon was king of\nAlethkar, so long ago. In the time before the Heralds left.\nDalinar felt as if he could almost see it. The secret. The thing that had\nmade Gavilar so excited in the months before his death. If Dalinar could\njust stretch a little farther, he’d make it out. See the pattern in the lives of\nmen. And finally know.\nBut that was what he’d been doing for the last six years. Grasping,\nstretching, reaching just a little farther. The farther he reached, the more\ndistant those answers seemed to become.\nAdolin stepped into the Gallery of Maps. His father was still there, standing\nalone. Two members of the Cobalt Guard watched over him from a\ndistance. Roion was nowhere to be seen.\nAdolin approached slowly. His father had that look in his eyes, the\nabsent one he got so often lately. Even when he wasn’t having an episode,\nhe wasn’t entirely here. Not in the way he once had been.\n“Father?” Adolin said, stepping up to him.\n“Hello, Adolin.”\n“How was the meeting with Roion?” Adolin asked, trying to sound\ncheerful.\n“Disappointing. I’m proving far worse at diplomacy than I once was at\nwar-making.”\n“There’s no profit in peace.”\n“That’s what everyone says. But we had peace once, and seemed to do\njust fine. Better, even.”\n“There hasn’t been peace since the Tranquiline Halls,” Adolin said\nimmediately. “‘Man’s life on Roshar is conflict.’” It was a quotation from\nThe Arguments.\nDalinar turned to Adolin, looking amused. “Quoting scripture at me?\nYou?”\nAdolin shrugged, feeling foolish. “Well, you see, Malasha is rather\nreligious, and so earlier today I was listening to—”\n“Wait,” Dalinar said. “Malasha? Who’s that?”\n“Daughter of Brightlord Seveks.”\n“And that other girl, Janala?”\nAdolin grimaced, thinking back to the disastrous walk they’d gone on\nthe other day. Several nice gifts had yet to repair that. She didn’t seem half\nas excited about him now that he wasn’t courting someone else. “Things are\nrocky. Malasha seems like a better prospect.” He moved on quickly. “I take\nit that Roion won’t soon be going on any plateau assault with us.”\nDalinar shook his head. “He’s too afraid that I’m trying to maneuver\nhim into a position where I can seize his lands. Perhaps it was wrong to\napproach the weakest highprince first. He’d rather hunker down and try to\nweather what comes at him, holding what he has, as opposed to making a\nrisky play for something greater.”"

        "text": "approach the weakest highprince first. He’d rather hunker down and try to\nweather what comes at him, holding what he has, as opposed to making a\nrisky play for something greater.”\nDalinar stared at the map, looking distant again. “Gavilar dreamed of\nunifying Alethkar. Once I thought he’d achieved it, despite what he\nclaimed. The longer I work with these men, the more I realize that Gavilar\nwas right. We failed. We defeated these men, but we never unified them.”\n“So you still intend to approach the others?”\n“I do. I only need one to say yes in order to start. Who do you think we\nshould go to next?”\n“I’m not sure,” Adolin said. “But for now, I think you should know\nsomething. Sadeas has sent to us, asking permission to enter our warcamp.\nHe wants to interview the grooms who cared for His Majesty’s horse during\nthe hunt.”\n“His new position gives him the right to make those kinds of\ndemands.”\n“Father,” Adolin said, stepping closer, speaking softly. “I think he’s\ngoing to move against us.”\nDalinar looked at him.\n“I know you trust him,” Adolin said quickly. “And I understand your\nreasons now. But listen to me. This move puts him in an ideal position to\nundermine us. The king has grown paranoid enough that he’s suspicious\neven of you and me—I know you’ve seen it. All Sadeas needs to do is find\nimaginary ‘evidence’ linking us to an attempt to kill the king, and he’ll be\nable be able to turn Elhokar against us.”\n“We may have to risk that.”\nAdolin frowned. “But—”\n“I trust Sadeas, son,” Dalinar said. “But even if I didn’t, we couldn’t\nforbid him entry or block his investigation. We’d not only look guilty in the\nking’s eyes, but we’d be denying his authority as well.” He shook his head.\n“If I ever want the other highprinces to accept me as their leader in war, I\nhave to be willing to allow Sadeas his authority as Highprince of\nInformation. I can’t rely upon the old traditions for my authority yet deny\nSadeas the same right.”\n“I suppose,” Adolin admitted. “But we could still prepare. You can’t\ntell me you’re not a little worried.”\nDalinar hesitated. “Perhaps. This maneuver of Sadeas’s is aggressive.\nBut I’ve been told what to do. ‘Trust Sadeas. Be strong. Act with honor, and\nhonor will aid you.’ That is the advice I’ve been given.”\n“From where?”\nDalinar looked to him, and it became obvious to Adolin.\n“So we’re betting the future of our house on these visions now,”\nAdolin said flatly.\n“I wouldn’t say that,” Dalinar replied. “If Sadeas did move against us,\nI wouldn’t simply let him shove us over. But I’m also not going to make the\nfirst move against him.”\n“Because of what you’ve seen,” Adolin said, growing frustrated.\n“Father, you said you’d listen to what I had to say about the visions. Well,\nplease listen now.”\n“This isn’t the proper place.”"

Well,\nplease listen now.”\n“This isn’t the proper place.”\n“You always have an excuse,” Adolin said. “I’ve tried to approach you\nabout it five times now, and you always rebuff me!”\n“Perhaps it’s because I know what you’ll say,” Dalinar said. “And I\nknow it won’t do any good.”\n“Or perhaps it’s because you don’t want to be confronted by the truth.”\n“That’s enough, Adolin.”\n“No, no it’s not! We’re mocked in every one of the warcamps, our\nauthority and reputation diminishes by the day, and you refuse to do\nanything substantial about it!”\n“Adolin. I will not take this from my son.”\n“But you’ll take it from everyone else? Why is that, Father? When\nothers say things about us, you let them. But when Renarin or I take the\nsmallest step toward what you view as being inappropriate, we’re\nimmediately chastised! Everyone else can speak lies, but I can’t speak the\ntruth? Do your sons mean so little to you?”\nDalinar froze, looking as if he’d been slapped.\n“You aren’t well, Father,” Adolin continued. Part of him realized that\nhe had gone too far, that he was speaking too loudly, but it boiled out\nanyway. “We need to stop tiptoeing around it! You need to stop making up\nincreasingly irrational explanations to reason away your lapses! I know it’s\nhard to accept, but sometimes, people get old. Sometimes, the mind stops\nworking right.\n“I don’t know what’s wrong. Maybe it’s your guilt over Gavilar’s\ndeath. That book, the Codes, the visions—maybe they’re all attempts to find\nescape, find redemption, something. What you see is not real. Your life now\nis a rationalization, a way of trying to pretend that what’s happening isn’t\nhappening. But I’ll go to Damnation itself before I’ll let you drag the entire\nhouse down without speaking my mind on it!”\nHe practically shouted those last words. They echoed in the large\nchamber, and Adolin realized he was shaking. He had never, in all his years\nof life, spoken to his father in such a way.\n“You think I haven’t wondered these things?” Dalinar said, his voice\ncold, his eyes hard. “I’ve gone through each point you’ve made a dozen\ntimes over.”\n“Then maybe you should go over them a few more.”\n“I must trust myself. The visions are trying to show me something\nimportant. I cannot prove it or explain how I know. But it’s true.”\n“Of course you think that,” Adolin said, exasperated. “Don’t you see?\nThat’s exactly what you would feel. Men are very good at seeing what they\nwant to! Look at the king. He sees a killer in every shadow, and a worn\nstrap becomes a convoluted plot to take his life.”\nDalinar fell silent again.\n“Sometimes, the simple answers are the right ones, Father!” Adolin\nsaid. “The king’s strap just wore out. And you…you’re seeing things that\naren’t there. I’m sorry.”"

I’m sorry.”\nThey locked expressions. Adolin didn’t look away. He wouldn’t look\naway.\nDalinar finally turned from him. “Leave me, please.”\n“All right. Fine. But I want you to think about this. I want you to—”\n“Adolin. Go.”\nAdolin gritted his teeth, but turned and stalked away. It needed to be\nsaid, he told himself as he left the gallery.\nThat didn’t make him feel any less sick about having to be the one who\nsaid it.\nSEVEN YEARS AGO\n“It ain’t right, what they do,” the woman’s voice said. “You ain’t supposed\nto cut into folks, peering in to see what the Almighty placed hidden for\ngood reason.”\nKal froze, standing in an alleyway between two houses in Hearthstone.\nThe sky was wan overhead; winter had come for a time. The Weeping was\nnear, and highstorms were infrequent. For now, it was too cold for plants to\nenjoy the respite; rockbuds spent winter weeks curled up inside their shells.\nMost creatures hibernated, waiting for warmth to return. Fortunately,\nseasons generally lasted only a few weeks. Unpredictability. That was the\nway of the world. Only after death was there stability. So the ardents taught,\nat least.\nKal wore a thick, padded coat of breachtree cotton. The material was\nscratchy but warm, and had been dyed a deep brown. He kept the hood up,\nhis hands in his pockets. To his right sat the baker’s place—the family slept\nin the triangular crawlspace in back, and the front was their store. To Kal’s\nleft was one of Hearthstone’s taverns, where lavis ale and mudbeer flowed\nin abundance during winter weeks.\nHe could hear two women, unseen but chatting a short distance way.\n“You know that he stole from the old citylord,” one woman’s voice\nsaid, keeping her voice down. “An entire goblet full of spheres. The\nsurgeon says they were a gift, but he was the only one there when the\ncitylord died.”\n“There is a document, I hear,” the first voice said.\n“A few glyphs. Not a proper will. And whose hand wrote those\nglyphs? The surgeon himself. It ain’t right, the citylord not having a woman\nthere to be scribe. I’m telling you. It ain’t right what they do.”\nKal gritted his teeth, tempted to step out and let the women see that\nhe’d heard them. His father wouldn’t approve, though. Lirin wouldn’t want\nto cause strife or embarrassment.\nBut that was his father. So Kal marched right out of the alleyway,\npassing Nanha Terith and Nanha Relina standing and gossiping in front of\nthe bakery. Terith was the baker’s wife, a fat woman with curly dark hair.\nShe was in the middle of another calumny. Kal gave her a sharp look, and\nher brown eyes showed a satisfying moment of discomfiture.\nKal crossed the square carefully, wary of patches of ice. The door to\nthe bakery slammed shut behind him, the two women fleeing inside."

The door to\nthe bakery slammed shut behind him, the two women fleeing inside.\nHis satisfaction didn’t last long. Why did people always say such\nthings about his father? They called him morbid and unnatural, but would\nscurry out to buy glyphwards and charms from a passing apothecary or\nluck-merch. The Almighty pity a man who actually did something useful to\nhelp!\nStill stewing, Kal turned a few corners, walking to where his mother\nstood on a stepladder at the side of the town hall, carefully chipping at the\neaves of the building. Hesina was a tall woman, and she usually kept her\nhair pulled back into a tail, then wrapped a kerchief around her head. Today,\nshe wore a knit hat over that. She had a long brown coat that matched Kal’s,\nand the blue hem of her skirt just barely peeked out at the bottom.\nThe objects of her attention were a set of icicle-like pendants of rock\nthat had formed on the edges of the roof. Highstorms dropped stormwater,\nand stormwater carried crem. If left alone, crem eventually hardened into\nstone. Buildings grew stalactites, formed by stormwater slowly dripping\nfrom the eaves. You had to clean them off regularly, or risk weighing down\nthe roof so much that it collapsed.\nShe noticed him and smiled, her cheeks flushed from the cold. With a\nnarrow face, a bold chin, and full lips, she was a pretty woman. At least Kal\nthought so. Prettier than the baker’s wife, for sure.\n“Your father dismissed you from your lessons already?” she asked.\n“Everyone hates Father,” Kal blurted out.\nHis mother turned back to her work. “Kaladin, you’re thirteen. You’re\nold enough to know not to say foolish things like that.”\n“It’s true,” he said stubbornly. “I heard some women talking, just now.\nThey said that Father stole the spheres from Brightlord Wistiow. They say\nthat Father enjoys slicing people open and doing things that ain’t natural.”\n“Aren’t natural.”\n“Why can’t I speak like everyone else?”\n“Because it isn’t proper.”\n“It’s proper enough for Nanha Terith.”\n“And what do you think of her?”\nKal hesitated. “She’s ignorant. And she likes to gossip about things she\ndoesn’t know anything about.”\n“Well, then. If you wish to emulate her, I can obviously find no\nobjection to the practice.”\nKal grimaced. You had to watch yourself when speaking with Hesina;\nshe liked to twist words about. He leaned back against the wall of the town\nhall, watching his breath puff out in front of him. Perhaps a different tactic\nwould work. “Mother, why do people hate Father?”\n“They don’t hate him,” she said. However, his calmly asked question\ngot her to continue. “But he does make them uncomfortable.”\n“Why?”\n“Because some people are frightened of knowledge. Your father is a\nlearned man; he knows things the others can’t understand. So those things\nmust be dark and mysterious.”\n“They aren’t afraid of luckmerches and glyphwards.”\n“Those you can understand,” his mother said calmly. “You burn a"

It’s easy.\nYour father won’t give someone a ward to heal them. He’ll insist that they\nstay in bed, drinking water, taking some foul medicine, and washing their\nwound each day. It’s hard. They’d rather leave it all to fate.”\nKal considered that. “I think they hate him because he fails too often.”\n“There is that. If a glyphward fails, you can blame it on the will of the\nAlmighty. If your father fails, then it’s his fault. Or such is the perception.”\nHis mother continued working, flakes of stone falling to the ground around\nher. “They’ll never actually hate your father—he’s too useful. But he’ll\nnever really be one of them. That’s the price of being a surgeon. Having\npower over the lives of men is an uncomfortable responsibility.”\n“And if I don’t want that responsibility? What if I just want to be\nsomething normal, like a baker, or a farmer, or…” Or a soldier, he added in\nhis mind. He’d picked up a staff a few times in secret, and though he’d\nnever been able to replicate that moment when he’d fought Jost, there was\nsomething invigorating about holding a weapon. Something that drew him\nand excited him.\n“I think,” his mother said, “that you’ll find the lives of bakers and\nfarmers are not so enviable.”\n“At least they have friends.”\n“And so do you. What of Tien?”\n“Tien’s not my friend, Mother. He’s my brother.”\n“Oh, and he can’t be both at once?”\nKal rolled his eyes. “You know what I mean.”\nShe climbed down from the stepladder, patting his shoulder. “Yes, I do,\nand I’m sorry to make light of it. But you put yourself in a difficult position.\nYou want friends, but do you really want to act like the other boys? Give up\nyour studies so you can slave in the fields? Grow old before your time,\nweathered and furrowed by the sun?”\nKal didn’t reply.\n“The things that others have always seem better than what you have,”\nhis mother said. “Bring the stepladder.”\nKal followed dutifully, rounding the town hall to the other side, then\nputting down the ladder so his mother could climb up to begin work again.\n“The others think Father stole those spheres.” Kal shoved his hands in\nhis pockets. “They think he wrote out that order from Brightlord Wistiow\nand had the old man sign it when he didn’t know what he was doing.”\nHis mother was silent.\n“I hate their lies and gossip,” Kal said. “I hate them for making up\nthings about us.”\n“Don’t hate them, Kal. They’re good people. In this case, they’re just\nrepeating what they’ve heard.” She glanced at the citylord’s manor, distant\nupon a hill above the town.

Now that her father was dead, her nurse oversaw her\ntime, and the woman didn’t think mingling with boys from the town was\nappropriate.\nThe nurse’s husband, Miliv, had been Brightlord Wistiow’s head\nsteward. If there was a source of bad rumors about Kal’s family, it probably\ncame from him. He never had liked Kal’s father. Well, Miliv wouldn’t\nmatter soon. A new citylord was expected to arrive any day.\n“Mother,” Kal said, “those spheres are just sitting there doing nothing\nbut glowing. Can’t we spend some to keep you from having to come out\nhere and work?”\n“I like working,” she said, scraping away again. “It clears the head.”\n“Didn’t you just tell me that I wouldn’t like having to labor? My face\nfurrowed before its time, or something poetic like that?”\nShe hesitated, then laughed. “Clever boy.”\n“Cold boy,” he grumbled, shivering.\n“I work because I want to. We can’t spend those spheres—they’re for\nyour education—and so my working is better than forcing your father to\ncharge for his healings.”\n“Maybe they’d respect us more if we did charge.”\n“Oh, they respect us. No, I don’t think that is the problem.” She looked\ndown at Kal. “You know that we’re second nahn.”\n“Sure,” Kal said, shrugging.\n“An accomplished young surgeon of the right rank could draw the\nattention of a poorer noble family, one who wished money and acclaim. It\nhappens in the larger cities.”\nKal glanced up at the mansion again. “That’s why you encouraged me\nto play with Laral so much. You wanted to marry me off to her, didn’t you?”\n“It was a possibility,” his mother said, returning to her work.\nHe honestly wasn’t certain how he felt about that. The last few months\nhad been strange for Kal. His father had forced him into his studies, but in\nsecret he’d spent his time with the staff. Two possible paths. Both enticing.\nKal did like learning, and he longed for the ability to help people, bind their\nwounds, make them better. He saw true nobility in what his father did.\nBut it seemed to Kal that if he could fight, he could do something even\nmore noble. Protect their lands, like the great lighteyed heroes of the stories.\nAnd there was the way he felt when holding a weapon.\nTwo paths. Opposites, in many ways. He could only choose one.\nHis mother kept chipping away at the eaves, and—with a sigh—Kal\nfetched a second stepladder and set of tools from the workroom, then joined\nher.

That was another aspect of becoming a surgeon. If he chose that path,\nhe would be choosing the life of his father. Choosing to set himself apart, to\nbe isolated.\nIf he went to war, however, he would have a place. Maybe he could\neven do the nearly unthinkable, win a Shardblade and become a true\nlighteyes. Then he could marry Laral and not have to be her inferior. Was\nthat why she’d always encouraged him to become a soldier? Had she been\nthinking about these kinds of things, even back then? Back then, these kinds\nof decisions—marriage, his future—had seemed impossibly far-off to Kal.\nHe felt so young. Did he really have to consider these questions? It\nwould still be another few years before the surgeons of Kharbranth would\nlet him take their tests. But if he were going to become a soldier instead,\nhe’d have to join the army before that happened. How would his father\nreact if Kal just up and went with the recruiters? Kal wasn’t certain he’d be\nable to face Lirin’s disappointed eyes.\nAs if in response to his thoughts, Lirin’s voice called from nearby.\n“Hesina!”\nKal’s mother turned, smiling and tucking a stray lock of dark hair back\ninto her kerchief. Kal’s father rushed down the street, his face anxious. Kal\nfelt a sudden jolt of worry. Who was wounded? Why hadn’t Lirin sent for\nhim?\n“What is it?” Kal’s mother asked, climbing down.\n“He’s here, Hesina,” Kal’s father said.\n“About time.”\n“Who?” Kal asked, jumping down from the stepladder. “Who’s here?”\n“The new citylord, son,” Lirin said, his breath puffing in the cold air.\n“His name is Brightlord Roshone. No time to change, I’m afraid. Not if we\nwant to catch his first speech. Come on!”\nThe three of them hurried away, Kal’s thoughts and worries banished\nin the face of the chance to meet a new lighteyes.\n“He didn’t send word ahead,” Lirin said under his breath.\n“That could be a good sign,” Hesina replied. “Maybe he doesn’t feel\nhe needs everyone to dote on him.”\n“That, or he’s inconsiderate. Stormfather, I hate getting a new Landed.\nAlways makes me feel like I’m throwing a handful of stones into a game of\nbreakneck. Will we throw the queen or the tower?”\n“We shall see soon enough,” Hesina said, glancing at Kal. “Don’t let\nyour father’s words unnerve you. He always gets pessimistic at times like\nthis.”\n“I do not,” Lirin said.\nShe gave him a look.\n“Name one other time.”\n“Meeting my parents.”\nKal’s father pulled up short, blinking. “Stormwinds,” he muttered,\n“let’s hope this doesn’t go half as poorly as that.”\nKal listened with curiosity.

Soon, the three of them reached the south side of\ntown. A crowd was gathered, and Tien was already there, waiting. He\nwaved in his excitable way, jumping up and down.\n“Wish I had half that boy’s energy,” Lirin said.\n“I’ve got a place for us picked out!” Tien called eagerly, pointing. “By\nthe rain barrels! Come on! We’re going to miss it!”\nTien scurried over, climbing atop the barrels. Several of the town’s\nother boys noticed him, and they nudged one another, one making some\ncomment Kal couldn’t hear. It set the others laughing at Tien, and that\nimmediately made Kal furious. Tien didn’t deserve mockery just because he\nwas a little small for his age.\nThis wasn’t a good time to confront the other boys, though, so Kal\nsullenly joined his parents beside the barrels. Tien smiled at him, standing\natop his barrel. He’d piled a few of his favorite rocks near him, stones of\ndifferent colors and shapes. There were rocks all around them, and yet Tien\nwas the only person he knew who found wonder in them. After a moment’s\nconsideration, Kal climbed atop a barrel—careful not to disturb any of\nTien’s rocks—so he too could get a better view of the citylord’s procession.\nIt was enormous. There must have been a dozen wagons in that line,\nfollowing a fine black carriage pulled by four sleek black horses. Kal\ngawked despite himself. Wistiow had only owned one horse, and it had\nseemed as old as he was.\nCould one man, even a lighteyes, own that much furniture? Where\nwould he put it all? And there were people too. Dozens of them, riding in\nthe wagons, walking in groups. There were also a dozen soldiers in\ngleaming breastplates and leather skirts. This lighteyes even had his own\nhonor guard.\nEventually the procession reached the turn-off to Hearthstone. A man\nriding a horse led the carriage and its soldiers forward to the town while\nmost of the wagons continued up to the manor. Kal grew increasingly\nexcited as the carriage rolled slowly into place. Would he finally get to see a\nreal, lighteyed hero? The word around town claimed it was likely that the\nnew citylord would be someone King Gavilar or Highprince Sadeas had\npromoted because he’d distinguished himself in the wars to unite Alethkar.\nThe carriage turned sideways so that the door faced the crowd. The\nhorses snorted and stomped the ground, and the carriage driver hopped\ndown and quickly opened the door. A middle-aged man with a short, grey-\nstreaked beard stepped out. He wore a ruffled violet coat, tailored so that it\nwas short at the front—reaching only to his waist—but long at the back.\nBeneath it, he wore a golden takama, a long, straight skirt that went down to\nhis calves.\nA takama.

Kal hadn’t expected\nthe takama to look so much like a woman’s skirt, but still, it was a good\nsign. Roshone himself seemed a little too old, a little too flabby, to be a true\nsoldier. But he wore a sword.\nThe lighteyed man scanned the crowd, a distasteful look on his face, as\nif he’d swallowed something bitter. Behind the man, two people peeked out.\nA younger man with a narrow face and an older woman with braided hair.\nRoshone studied the crowd, then shook his head and turned around to climb\nback in the carriage.\nKal frowned. Wasn’t he going to say anything? The crowd seemed to\nshare Kal’s shock; a few of them began whispering in anxiety.\n“Brightlord Roshone!” Kal’s father called.\nThe crowd hushed. The lighteyed man glanced back. People shied\naway, and Kal found himself shrinking down beneath that harsh gaze. “Who\nspoke?” Roshone demanded, his voice a low baritone.\nLirin stepped forward, raising a hand. “Brightlord. Was your trip\npleasant? Please, can we show you the town?”\n“What is your name?”\n“Lirin, Brightlord. Hearthstone’s surgeon.”\n“Ah,” Roshone said. “You’re the one who let old Wistiow die.” The\nbrightlord’s expression darkened. “In a way, it’s your fault I’m in this\npitiful, miserable quarter of the kingdom.” He grunted, then climbed back\nin the carriage and slammed the door. Within seconds, the carriage driver\nhad replaced the stairs, climbed into his place, and started turning the\nvehicle around.\nKal’s father slowly let his arm fall to his side. The townspeople began\nto chatter immediately, gossiping about the soldiers, the carriage, the\nhorses.\nKal sat down on his barrel. Well, he thought. I guess we could expect a\nwarrior to be curt, right? The heroes from the legends weren’t necessarily\nthe polite types. Killing people and fancy talking didn’t always go together,\nold Jarel had once told him.\nLirin walked back, his expression troubled.\n“Well?” Hesina said, trying to sound cheerful. “What do you think?\nDid we throw the queen or the tower?”\n“Neither.”\n“Oh? And what did we throw instead?”\n“I’m not sure,” he said, glancing over his shoulder. “A pair and a trio,\nmaybe. Let’s get back home.”\nTien scratched his head in confusion, but the words weighed on Kal.\nThe tower was three pairs in a game of breakneck. The queen was two trios.\nThe first was an outright loss, the other an outright win.\nBut a pair and a trio, that was called the butcher. Whether you won or\nnot would depend on the other throws you made.\nAnd, more importantly, on the throws of everyone else.\nI am being chased. Your friends of the Seventeenth Shard, I suspect. I\nbelieve they’re still lost, following a false trail I left for them. They’ll\nbe happier that way. I doubt they have any inkling what to do with me\nshould they actually catch me."

I doubt they have any inkling what to do with me\nshould they actually catch me.\n“I stood in the darkened monastery chamber,’” Litima read, standing at the\nlectern with the tome open before her, “‘its far reaches painted with pools of\nblack where light did not wander. I sat on the floor, thinking of that dark,\nthat Unseen. I could not know, for certain, what was hidden in that night. I\nsuspected there were walls, sturdy and thick, but could I know without\nseeing? When all was hidden, what could a man rely upon as True?’”\nLitima—one of Dalinar’s scribes—was tall and plump and wore a\nviolet silk gown with yellow trim. She read to Dalinar as he stood,\nregarding the maps on the wall of his sitting room. That room was fitted\nwith handsome wood furnishings and fine woven rugs imported up from\nMarat. A crystal carafe of afternoon wine—orange, not intoxicating—sat on\na high-legged serving table in the corner, sparkling with the light of the\ndiamond spheres hanging in chandeliers above.\n“‘Candle flames,’” Litima continued. The selection was from The Way\nof Kings, read from the very copy that Gavilar had once owned. “‘A dozen\ncandles burned themselves to death on the shelf before me. Each of my\nbreaths made them tremble. To them, I was a behemoth, to frighten and\ndestroy. And yet, if I strayed too close, they could destroy me. My invisible\nbreath, the pulses of life that flowed in and out, could end them freely, while\nmy fingers could not do the same without being repaid in pain.’”\nDalinar idly twisted his signet ring in thought; it was sapphire with his\nKholin glyphpair on it. Renarin stood next to him, wearing a coat of blue\nand silver, golden knots on the shoulders marking him as a prince. Adolin\nwasn’t there. Dalinar and he had been stepping gingerly around one another\nsince their argument in the Gallery.\n“‘I understood in a moment of stillness,’” Litima read. “‘Those candle\nflames were like the lives of men. So fragile. So deadly. Left alone, they lit\nand warmed. Let run rampant, they would destroy the very things they were\nmeant to illuminate. Embryonic bonfires, each bearing a seed of destruction\nso potent it could tumble cities and dash kings to their knees. In later years,\nmy mind would return to that calm, silent evening, when I had stared at\nrows of living lights. And I would understand. To be given loyalty is to be\ninfused like a gemstone, to be granted the frightful license to destroy not\nonly one’s self, but all within one’s care.’”\nLitima fell still. It was the end of the sequence.\n“Thank you, Brightness Litima,” Dalinar said. “That will do.”\nThe woman bowed her head respectfully.

Someone else had known, someone else had\nunderstood, how he felt. But today, it didn’t bring the solace it usually did.\nIt only reminded him of Adolin’s arguments. None had been things Dalinar\nhadn’t considered himself, but being confronted with them by someone he\ntrusted had shaken everything. He found himself staring at his maps,\nsmaller copies of those that hung in the Gallery. They had been recreated\nfor him by the royal cartographer, Isasik Shulin.\nWhat if Dalinar’s visions really were just phantasms? He’d often\nlonged for the glory days of Alethkar’s past. Were the visions his mind’s\nanswer to that, a subconscious way of letting himself be a hero, of giving\nhimself justification for doggedly seeking his goals?\nA disturbing thought. Looked at another way, those phantom\ncommands to “unify” sounded a great deal like what the Hierocracy had\nsaid when it had tried to conquer the world five centuries before.\nDalinar turned from his maps and walked across the room, his booted\nfeet falling on a soft rug. Too nice a rug. He’d spent the better part of his\nlife in one warcamp or another; he’d slept in wagons, stone barracks, and\ntents pulled tight against the leeward side of stone formations. Compared\nwith that, his present dwelling was practically a mansion. He felt as if he\nshould cast out all of this finery. But what would that accomplish?\nHe stopped at the lectern and ran his fingers along the thick pages\nfilled with lines in violet ink. He couldn’t read the words, but he could\nalmost feel them, emanating from the page like Stormlight from a sphere.\nWere the words of this book the cause of his problems? The visions had\nstarted several months after he’d first listened to readings from it.\nHe rested his hand on the cold, ink-filled pages. Their homeland was\nstressed nearly to breaking, the war was stalled, and suddenly he found\nhimself captivated by the very ideals and myths that had led to his brother’s\ndownfall. This was a time the Alethi needed the Blackthorn, not an old,\ntired soldier who fancied himself a philosopher.\nBlast it all, he thought. I thought I’d figured this out! He closed the\nleather-bound volume, the spine crackling. He carried it to the bookshelf\nand returned it to its place.\n“Father?” Renarin asked. “Is there something I can do for you?”\n“I wish there were, son.” Dalinar tapped the spine of the book lightly.\n“It’s ironic. This book was once considered one of the great masterpieces of\npolitical philosophy. Did you know that? Jasnah told me that kings around\nthe world used to study it daily. Now, it is considered borderline\nblasphemous.”\nRenarin gave no reply.\n“Regardless,” Dalinar said, walking back to the wall map. “Highprince\nAladar refused my offer of an alliance, just as Roion did. Do you have a\nthought on whom should I approach next?”\n“Adolin says we should be far more worried about Sadeas’s ploy to\ndestroy us than we are.”"

        "text": "thought on whom should I approach next?”\n“Adolin says we should be far more worried about Sadeas’s ploy to\ndestroy us than we are.”\nThe room fell silent. Renarin had a habit of doing that, felling\nconversations like an enemy archer hunting officers on the battlefield.\n“Your brother is right to worry,” Dalinar said. “But moving against\nSadeas would undermine Alethkar as a kingdom. For the same reason,\nSadeas won’t risk acting against us. He’ll see.”\nI hope.\nHorns suddenly sounded outside, their deep, resounding calls echoing.\nDalinar and Renarin froze. Parshendi spotted on the Plains. A second set\ncame. Twenty-third plateau of the second quadrant. Dalinar’s scouts thought\nthe contested plateau close enough for their forces to reach first.\nDalinar dashed across the room, all other thoughts discarded for the\nmoment, his booted feet thumping on the thick rug. He threw open the door\nand charged down the Stormlight-illuminated hallway.\nThe war room door was open, and Teleb—highofficer on duty—\nsaluted as Dalinar entered. Teleb was a straight-backed man with light green\neyes. He kept his long hair in a braid and had a blue tattoo on his cheek,\nmarking him as an Oldblood. At the side of the room, his wife, Kalami, sat\nbehind a long-legged desk on a high stool. She wore her dark hair with only\ntwo small side braids pinned up, the rest hanging down the back of her\nviolet dress to brush the top of the stool. She was a historian of note, and\nhad requested permission to record meetings like this one; she planned to\nscribe a history of the war.\n“Sir,” Teleb said. “A chasmfiend crawled atop the plateau here less\nthan a quarter hour ago.” He pointed to the battle map, which had glyphs\nmarking each plateau. Dalinar stepped up to it, a group of his officers\ngathering around him.\n“How far would you say that is?” Dalinar asked, rubbing his chin.\n“Perhaps two hours,” Teleb said, indicating a route one of his men had\ndrawn on the map. “Sir, I think we have a good chance at this one.\nBrightlord Aladar will have to traverse six unclaimed plateaus to reach the\ncontested area, while we have a nearly direct line. Brightlord Sadeas would\nhave trouble, as he’d have to work his way around several large chasms too\nwide to cross with bridges. I’ll bet he won’t even try for it.”\nDalinar did, indeed, have the most direct line. He hesitated, though. It\nhad been months since he’d last gone on a plateau run. His attention had\nbeen diverted, his troops needed for protecting roadways and patrolling the\nlarge markets that had grown up outside the warcamps. And now, Adolin’s\nquestions weighed upon him, pressing him down. It seemed like a terrible\ntime to go out to battle.\nNo, he thought. No, I need to do this. Winning a plateau skirmish\nwould do much for his troops’ morale, and would help discredit the rumors\nin camp.\n“We march!” Dalinar declared.\nA few of the officers whooped in excitement, an extreme show of\nemotion for the normally reserved Alethi."

He’d heard of the\nconfrontation between them. Dalinar doubted there was a person in all ten\nwarcamps who hadn’t heard of it.\n“Send for him,” Dalinar said firmly. Adolin probably needed this as\nmuch as, or more than, Dalinar did.\nThe officers scattered. Dalinar’s armor bearers entered a moment later.\nIt had only been a few minutes since the horns had sounded, but after\nsix years of fighting, the machine of war ran smoothly when battle called.\nFrom outside, he heard the horns’ third set begin, calling his forces to battle.\nThe armor bearers inspected his boots—checking to be certain the\nlaces were tight—then brought a long padded vest to throw over his\nuniform. Next, they set the sabatons—armor for his boots—on the floor\nbefore him. They encased his boots entirely and had a rough surface on the\nbottoms that seemed to cling to rock. The interiors glowed with the light of\nthe sapphires in their indented pockets.\nDalinar was reminded of his most recent vision. The Radiant, his\narmor glowing with glyphs. Modern Shardplate didn’t glow like that. Could\nhis mind have fabricated that detail? Would it have?\nNo time to consider that now, he thought. He discarded his\nuncertainties and worries, something he’d learned to do during his first\nbattles as a youth. A warrior needed to be focused. Adolin’s questions\nwould still be waiting for him when he got back. For now, he couldn’t\nafford self-doubt or uncertainty. It was time to be the Blackthorn.\nHe stepped into the sabatons, and the straps tightened of their own\naccord, fitting around his boots. The greaves came next, going over his legs\nand knees, locking on to the sabatons. Shardplate wasn’t like ordinary\narmor; there was no mesh of steel mail and no leather straps at the joints.\nShardplate seams were made of smaller plates, interlocking, overlapping,\nincredibly intricate, leaving no vulnerable gaps. There was very little\nrubbing or chafing; each piece fit together perfectly, as if it had been crafted\nspecifically for Dalinar.\nOne always put the armor on from the feet upward. Shardplate was\nextremely heavy; without the enhanced strength it provided, no man would\nbe able to fight in it. Dalinar stood still as the armor bearers affixed the\ncuisses over his thighs and locked them to the culet and faulds across his\nwaist and lower back. A skirt made of small, interlocking plates came next,\nreaching down to just above the knees.\n“Brightlord,” Teleb said, stepping up to him. “Have you given thought\nto my suggestion about the bridges?”\n“You know how I feel about man-carried bridges, Teleb,” Dalinar said\nas the armor bearers locked his breastplate into place, then worked on the\nrerebraces and vambraces for his arms. Already, he could feel the strength\nof the Plate surging through him.\n“We wouldn’t have to use the smaller bridges for the assault,” Teleb"

Already, he could feel the strength\nof the Plate surging through him.\n“We wouldn’t have to use the smaller bridges for the assault,” Teleb\nsaid. “Just for getting to the contested plateau.”\n“We’d still have to bring the chull-pulled bridges to get across that last\nchasm,” Dalinar said. “I’m not convinced that bridge crews would move us\nany more quickly. Not when we have to wait for those animals.”\nTeleb sighed.\nDalinar reconsidered. A good officer was one who accepted orders and\nfulfilled them, even when he disagreed. But the mark of a great officer was\nthat he also tried to innovate and offer appropriate suggestions.\n“You may recruit and train a single bridge crew,” Dalinar said. “We\nshall see. In these races, even a few minutes can be meaningful.”\nTeleb smiled. “Thank you, sir.”\nDalinar waved with his left hand as the armor bearers locked the\ngauntlet onto his right. He made a fist, tiny plates curving perfectly. The left\ngauntlet followed. Then the gorget went over his head, covering his neck,\nthe pauldrons on his shoulders, and the helm on his head. Finally, the armor\nbearers affixed his cape to the pauldrons.\nDalinar took a deep breath, feeling the Thrill build for the approaching\nbattle. He strode from the war room, footfalls firm and solid. Attendants and\nservants scattered before him, making way. Wearing Shardplate again after\na long period without was like waking up after a night of feeling groggy or\ndisoriented. The spring of the step, the impetus the armor seemed to lend\nhim, made him want to race down the hallway and—\nAnd why not?\nHe broke into a sprint. Teleb and the others cried out in surprise,\nrushing to keep up. Dalinar outpaced them easily, reaching the front gates\nof the complex and leaping through, throwing himself off the long steps\nleading down from his enclave. He exulted, grinning as he hung in the air,\nthen slammed to the ground. The force cracked the stone beneath him, and\nhe crouched into the impact.\nBefore him, neat rows of barracks ran through his warcamp, formed in\nradials with a meeting ground and mess hall at the center of each battalion.\nHis officers reached the top of the stairs, looking down with amazement.\nRenarin was with them, wearing his uniform that had never seen battle, his\nhand raised against the sunlight.\nDalinar felt foolish. Was he a youth just given his first taste of\nShardplate? Back to work. Stop playing.\nPerethom, his infantrylord, saluted as Dalinar strode up. “Second and\nThird Battalions are on duty today, Brightlord. Forming ranks to march.”\n“First Bridge Squad is gathered, Brightlord,” Havarah—the bridgelord\n—said, striding up. He was a short man, with some Herdazian blood in him\nas evidenced by his dark, crystalline fingernails, though he didn’t wear a\nspark-flicker. “I have word from Ashelem that the archery company is\nready.”\n“Cavalry?” Dalinar asked. “And where is my son?”"

Adolin—his Shardplate painted\na deep Kholin blue—made his way through the gathering crowd. His visor\nwas up, and he looked eager, though when he met Dalinar’s eyes, he\nglanced away immediately.\nDalinar held up a hand, quieting several officers who were trying to\ngive him reports. He strode to Adolin, and the youth looked up, meeting his\ngaze.\n“You said what you felt you must,” Dalinar said.\n“And I’m not sorry I did,” Adolin replied. “But I am sorry for how, and\nwhere, I said it. That won’t happen again.”\nDalinar nodded, and that was enough. Adolin seemed to relax, a\nweight coming off his shoulders, and Dalinar turned back to his officers. In\nmoments, he and Adolin were leading a hurried group to the staging area.\nAs they did, Dalinar did note Adolin waving to a young woman who stood\nbeside the way, wearing a red dress, her hair up in a very nice braiding.\n“Is that—er—”\n“Malasha?” Adolin said. “Yes.”\n“She looks nice.”\n“Most of the time she is, though she’s somewhat annoyed that I\nwouldn’t let her come with me today.”\n“She wanted to come into battle?”\nAdolin shrugged. “Says she’s curious.”\nDalinar said nothing. Battle was a masculine art. A woman wanting to\ncome to the battlefield was like…well, like a man wanting to read.\nUnnatural.\nAhead, in the staging area, the battalions were forming ranks, and a\nsquat lighteyed officer hurried up to Dalinar. He had patches of red hair on\nhis otherwise dark Alethi head and a long, red mustache. Ilamar, the\ncavalrylord.\n“Brightlord,” he said, “my apologies for the delay. Cavalry is mounted\nand ready.”\n“We march, then,” Dalinar said. “All ranks—”\n“Brightlord!” a voice said.\nDalinar turned as one of his messengers approached. The darkeyed\nman wore leathers marked with blue bands on the arms. He saluted, saying,\n“Highprince Sadeas has demanded admittance to the warcamp!”\nDalinar glanced at Adolin. His son’s expression darkened.\n“He claims the king’s writ of investigation grants him the right,” the\nmessenger said.\n“Admit him,” Dalinar said.\n“Yes, Brightlord,” the messenger said, turning back. One of the lesser\nofficers, Moratel, went with him so that Sadeas could be welcomed and\nescorted by a lighteyes as befitted his station. Moratel was least among\nthose in attendance; everyone understood he was the one Dalinar would\nsend.\n“What do you think Sadeas wants this time?” Dalinar said quietly to\nAdolin.\n“Our blood.

The men had an air of anticipation, spears held high, darkeyed\ncitizen officers standing at the sides with axes on their shoulders. At the\nfront of the force, a group of chulls snorted and rummaged at the rocks by\ntheir feet; harnessed to them were several enormous mobile bridges.\nGallant and Adolin’s white stallion Sureblood were waiting, their reins\nheld at the ready by grooms. Ryshadium hardly needed handlers. Once,\nGallant had kicked open his stall and made his way to the staging grounds\non his own when a groom had been too slow. Dalinar patted the midnight\ndestrier on the neck, then swung into the saddle.\nHe scanned the staging field, then raised his arm to give the command\nto move. However, he noticed a group of mounted men riding up to the\nstaging field, led by a figure in dark red Shardplate. Sadeas.\nDalinar stifled a sigh and gave the command to move out, though he\nhimself waited for the Highprince of Information. Adolin came over on\nSureblood, and he gave Dalinar a glance that seemed to say, “Don’t worry,\nI’ll behave.”\nAs always, Sadeas was a model of fashion, his armor painted, his helm\nornamented with a completely different metallic pattern than he had worn\nlast time. This one was shaped like a stylized sunburst. It looked almost like\na crown.\n“Brightlord Sadeas,” Dalinar said. “This is an inconvenient time for\nyour investigation.”\n“Unfortunately,” Sadeas said, reining in. “His Majesty is very eager to\nhave answers, and I cannot stop my investigation, even for a plateau assault.\nI need to interview some of your soldiers. I’ll do it on the way out.”\n“You want to come with us?”\n“Why not? I won’t delay you.” He glanced at the chulls, who lurched\ninto motion, pulling the bulky bridges. “I doubt that even were I to decide\nto crawl, I could slow you any further.”\n“Our soldiers need to concentrate on the upcoming battle, Brightlord,”\nAdolin said. “They should not be distracted.”\n“The king’s will must be done,” Sadeas said, shrugging, not even\nbothering to look at Adolin. “Need I present the writ? Surely you don’t\nintend to forbid me.”\nDalinar studied his former friend, looking into those eyes, trying to see\ninto the man’s soul. Sadeas lacked his characteristic smirk; he usually wore\none of those when he was pleased with how a plot was going. Did he realize\nthat Dalinar knew how to read his expressions, and so masked his\nemotions? “No need to present anything, Sadeas. My men are at your\ndisposal. If you have need of anything, simply ask. Adolin, with me.”\nDalinar turned Gallant and galloped down the line toward the front of\nthe marching army. Adolin followed reluctantly, and Sadeas remained\nbehind with his attendants.\nThe long ride began.

        "text": "The long ride began. The permanent bridges here were Dalinar’s,\nmaintained and guarded by his soldiers and scouts, connecting plateaus that\nhe controlled. Sadeas spent the trip riding near the middle of the column of\ntwo thousand. He periodically sent an attendant to pull certain soldiers out\nof line.\nDalinar spent the ride mentally preparing himself for the battle ahead.\nHe spoke with his officers about the layout of the plateau, got a report on\nwhere specifically the chasmfiend had chosen to make its chrysalis, and sent\nscouts ahead to watch for Parshendi. Those scouts carried their long poles\nto get them from plateau to plateau without bridges.\nDalinar’s force eventually reached the end of the permanent bridges,\nand had to start waiting for the chull bridges to be lowered across the\nchasms. The big machines were built like siege towers, with enormous\nwheels and armored sections at the side where soldiers could push. At a\nchasm, they unhooked the chulls, pushed the machine forward by hand, and\nratcheted a crank at the back to lower the bridge. Once the bridge was set\ndown, the machinery was unlocked and pulled across. The bridge was built\nso they could lock the machine onto the other side, pull the bridge up, then\nturn and hook the chulls up again.\nIt was a slow process. Dalinar watched from horseback, fingers\ntapping the side of his hogshide saddle as the first chasm was spanned.\nPerhaps Teleb was right. Could they use lighter, more portable bridges to\nget across these early chasms, then resort to the siege bridges only for the\nfinal assault?\nA clatter of hooves on rock announced someone riding up the side of\nthe column. Dalinar turned, expecting Adolin, and instead found Sadeas.\nWhy had Sadeas asked to be Highprince of Information, and why was\nhe so dogged in pursuing this matter of the broken girth? If he did decide to\ncreate some kind of false implication of Dalinar’s guilt…\nThe visions told me to trust him, Dalinar told himself firmly. But he\nwas growing less certain about them. How much dared he risk on what\nthey’d said?\n“Your soldiers are quite loyal to you,” Sadeas noted as he arrived.\n“Loyalty is the first lesson of a soldier’s life,” Dalinar said. “I would\nbe worried if these men hadn’t yet mastered it.”\nSadeas sighed. “Really, Dalinar. Must you always be so\nsanctimonious?”\nDalinar didn’t reply.\n“It’s odd, how a leader’s influence can affect his men,” Sadeas said.\n“So many of these are like smaller versions of you. Bundles of emotion,\nwrapped up and tied until they become stiff from the pressure. They’re so\nsure in some ways, yet so insecure in others.”\nDalinar kept his jaw clenched. What is your game, Sadeas?\nSadeas smiled, leaning in, speaking softly. “You want so badly to snap\nat me, don’t you? Even in the old days, you hated it when someone implied\nthat you were insecure. Back then, your displeasure often ended with a head\nor two rolling across the stones.”\n“I killed many who did not deserve death,” Dalinar said. “A man\nshould not fear losing his head because he took one too many sips of wine.”"

Doesn’t it pound on you inside, like someone trapped\nwithin a large drum? Beating, banging, trying to claw free?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said.\nThe admission seemed to surprise Sadeas. “And the Thrill, Dalinar. Do\nyou still feel the Thrill?”\nMen didn’t often speak of the Thrill, the joy and lust for battle. It was a\nprivate thing. “I feel each of the things you mention, Sadeas,” Dalinar said,\neyes forward. “But I don’t always let them out. A man’s emotions are what\ndefine him, and control is the hallmark of true strength. To lack feeling is to\nbe dead, but to act on every feeling is to be a child.”\n“That has the stink of a quote about it, Dalinar. From Gavilar’s little\nbook of virtues, I assume?”\n“Yes.”\n“Doesn’t it bother you at all that the Radiants betrayed us?”\n“Legends. The Recreance is an event so old, it might as well be in the\nshadowdays. What did the Radiants really do? Why did they do it? We\ndon’t know.”\n“We know enough. They used elaborate tricks to imitate great powers\nand pretend a holy calling. When their deceptions were discovered, they\nfled.”\n“Their powers were not lies. They were real.”\n“Oh?” Sadeas said, amused. “You know this? Didn’t you just say the\nevent was so old, it might as well have been in the shadowdays? If the\nRadiants had such marvelous powers, why can nobody reproduce them?\nWhere did those incredible skills go?”\n“I don’t know,” Dalinar said softly. “Perhaps we’re just not worthy of\nthem any longer.”\nSadeas snorted, and Dalinar wished he’d bitten his tongue. His only\nevidence for what he said was his visions. And yet, if Sadeas belittled\nsomething, he instinctively wanted to stand up for it.\nI can’t afford this. I need to be focused on the battle ahead.\n“Sadeas,” he said, determined to change the topic. “We need to work\nharder to unify the warcamps. I want your help, now that you’re Highprince\nof Information.”\n“To do what?”\n“To do what needs to be done. For the good of Alethkar.”\n“That’s exactly what I’m doing, old friend,” Sadeas said. “Killing\nParshendi. Winning glory and wealth for our kingdom. Seeking vengeance.\nIt would be best for Alethkar if you’d stop wasting so much time in camp—\nand stop talking of fleeing like cowards. It would be best for Alethkar if\nyou’d start acting like a man again.”\n“Enough, Sadeas!” Dalinar said, more loudly than he’d intended. “I\ngave you leave to come along for your investigation, not to taunt me!”\nSadeas sniffed. “That book ruined Gavilar.

You’ve listened to those stories so much they’ve got your head full of\nfalse ideals. Nobody ever really lived the way the Codes claim.”\n“Bah!” Dalinar said, waving a hand and turning Gallant. “I don’t\nhave time for your snideness today, Sadeas.” He trotted his horse away,\nfurious at Sadeas, then even more furious at himself for losing his temper.\nHe crossed the bridge, stewing, thinking of Sadeas’s words. He found\nhimself remembering a day when he stood with his brother beside the\nImpossible Falls of Kholinar.\nThings are different now, Dalinar, Gavilar had said. I see now, in ways\nI never did before. I wish I could show you what I mean.\nIt had been three days before his death.\nTen heartbeats.\nDalinar closed his eyes, breathing in and out—slowly, calmingly—as\nthey prepared themselves behind the siege bridge. Forget Sadeas. Forget the\nvisions. Forget his worries and fears. Just focus on the heartbeats.\nNearby, chulls scraped the rock with their hard, carapaced feet. The\nwind blew across his face, smelling wet. It always smelled wet out here, in\nthese humid stormlands.\nSoldiers clanked, leather creaked. Dalinar raised his head toward the\nsky, his heart thumping deep within him. The brilliant white sun stained his\neyelids red.\nMen shifted, called, cursed, loosened swords in their sheaths, tested\nbowstrings. He could feel their tension, their anxiety mixed with\nexcitement. Among them, anticipationspren began to spring from the\nground, streamers connected by one side to the stone, the others whipping\nin the air. Some fearspren boiled up among them.\n“Are you ready?” Dalinar asked softly. The Thrill was rising within\nhim.\n“Yes.” Adolin’s voice was eager.\n“You never complain about the way we attack,” Dalinar said, eyes still\nclosed. “You never challenge me on this.”\n“This is the best way. They’re my men too. What is the point of being\na Shardbearer if we cannot lead the charge?”\nThe tenth heartbeat sounded in Dalinar’s chest; he could always hear\nthe beats when he was summoning his Blade, no matter how loud the world\naround him was. The faster they passed, the sooner the blade arrived. So the\nmore urgent you felt, the sooner you were armed. Was that intentional, or\njust some quirk of the Shardblade’s nature?\nOathbringer’s familiar weight settled into his hand.\n“Go,” Dalinar said, snapping his eyes open. He slammed his visor\ndown as Adolin did the same, Stormlight rising from the sides as the helms\nsealed shut and became translucent. The two of them burst out from behind\nthe massive bridge—one Shardbearer on each side, a figure of blue and\nanother of slate grey.\nThe energy of the armor pulsed through Dalinar as he dashed across\nthe stone ground, arms pumping in rhythm with his steps.

The wave of\narrows came immediately, loosed from the Parshendi kneeling on the other\nside of the chasm. Dalinar flung his arm up in front of his eye slit as arrows\nsprayed across him, scraping metal, some shafts snapping. It felt like\nrunning against a hailstorm.\nAdolin bellowed a war cry from the right, voice muffled by his helm.\nAs they approached the chasm lip, Dalinar lowered his arm despite the\narrows. He needed to be able to judge his approach. The gulf was mere feet\naway. His Plate gave him a surge of strength as he reached the edge of the\nchasm.\nThen leaped.\nFor a moment, he soared above the inky chasm, cape flapping, arrows\nfilling the air around him. He was reminded of the flying Radiant from his\nvision. But this was nothing so mystical, just a standard Shardplate-assisted\njump. Dalinar cleared the chasm and crashed back to the ground on the\nother side, sweeping his Blade down and across to slay three Parshendi with\na single blow.\nTheir eyes burned black and smoke rose as they collapsed. He swung\nagain. Bits of armor and weapons sprayed into the air where arrows had\nonce flown, sheared free by his Blade. As always, it sliced apart anything\ninanimate, but blurred when it touched flesh, as if turning to mist.\nThe way it reacted to flesh and cut steel so easily, it sometimes felt to\nDalinar like he was swinging a weapon of pure smoke. As long as he kept\nthe Blade in motion, it could not get caught in chinks or stopped by the\nweight of what it was cutting.\nDalinar spun, sweeping out with his Blade in a line of death. He\nsheared through souls themselves, leaving Parshendi to drop dead to the\nground. Then he kicked, tossing a corpse into the faces of the Parshendi\nnearby. A few more kicks sent corpses flying—a Plate-driven kick could\neasily send a body tumbling thirty feet—clearing the ground around him for\nbetter footing.\nAdolin hit the plateau not far away, spinning and falling into\nWindstance. Adolin shoved his shoulder into a group of archers, tossing\nthem backward and throwing several into the chasm. Gripping his\nShardblade with both hands, he did an initial sweep as Dalinar had, cutting\ndown six enemies.\nThe Parshendi were singing, many of them wearing beards that glowed\nwith small uncut gemstones. Parshendi always sang as they fought; that\nsong changed as they abandoned their bows—pulling out axes, swords, or\nmaces—and threw themselves at the two Shardbearers.\nDalinar put himself at the optimal distance from Adolin, allowing his\nson to protect his blind spots, but not getting too close. The two\nShardbearers fought, still near the lip of the chasm, cutting down the\nParshendi who tried desperately to push them backward by sheer force of\nnumbers. This was their best chance to defeat the Shardbearers. Dalinar and\nAdolin were alone, without their honor guard. A fall from this height would\ncertainly kill even a man in Plate.\nThe Thrill rose within him, so sweet. Dalinar kicked away another"

Dalinar kicked away another\ncorpse, though he didn’t need the extra room. They’d noticed that the\nParshendi grew enraged when you moved their dead. He kicked another\nbody, taunting them, drawing them toward him to fight in pairs as they often\ndid.\nHe cut down a group that came, singing in voices angry at what he’d\ndone to their dead. Nearby, Adolin began to lay about him with punches as\nthe Parshendi got too close; he was fond of the tactic, switching between\nusing his sword in two hands or one. Parshendi corpses flew this way and\nthat, bones and armor shattered by the blows, orange Parshendi blood\nspraying across the ground. Adolin moved back to his Blade a moment\nlater, kicking away a corpse.\nThe Thrill consumed Dalinar, giving him strength, focus, and power.\nThe glory of the battle grew grand. He’d stayed away from this too long. He\nsaw with clarity now. They did need to push harder, assault more plateaus,\nwin the gemhearts.\nDalinar was the Blackthorn. He was a natural force, never to be halted.\nHe was death itself. He—\nHe felt a sudden stab of powerful revulsion, a sickness so strong that it\nmade him gasp. He slipped, partially on a patch of blood, but partially\nbecause his knees grew suddenly weak.\nThe corpses before him suddenly seemed a horrifying sight. Eyes\nburned out like spent coals. Bodies limp and broken, bones shattered where\nAdolin had punched them. Heads cracked open, blood and brains and\nentrails spilled around them. Such butchery, such death. The Thrill\nvanished.\nHow could a man enjoy this?\nThe Parshendi surged toward him. Adolin was there in a heartbeat,\nattacking with more skill than any other man Dalinar had known. The lad\nwas a genius with the Blade, an artist with paint of only one shade. He\nstruck expertly, forcing the Parshendi back. Dalinar shook his head,\nrecovering his stance.\nHe forced himself to resume fighting, and as the Thrill began to rise\nagain, Dalinar hesitantly embraced it. The odd sickness faded, and his battle\nreflexes took control. He spun into the Parshendi advance, sweeping out\nwith his Blade in broad, aggressive strokes.\nHe needed this victory. For himself, for Adolin, and for his men. Why\nhad he been so horrified? The Parshendi had murdered Gavilar. It was right\nto kill them.\nHe was a soldier. Fighting was what he did. And he did it well.\nThe Parshendi advance unit broke before his assault, scattering back\ntoward a larger mass of their troops, who were forming ranks in haste.\nDalinar stepped back and found himself looking down at the corpses around\nhim, with their blackened eyes. Smoke still curled from a few.\nThe sick feeling returned.\nLife ended so quickly. The Shardbearer was destruction incarnate, the\nmost powerful force on a battlefield.

Once these weapons meant protecting,\na voice inside of him whispered.\nThe three bridges crashed to the ground a few feet away, and the\ncavalry charged across a moment later, led by compact Ilamar. A few\nwindspren danced past in the air, nearly invisible. Adolin called for his\nhorse, but Dalinar just stood, looking down at the dead. Parshendi blood\nwas orange, and it smelled like mold. Yet their faces—marbled black or\nwhite and red—looked so human. A parshman nurse had practically raised\nDalinar.\nLife before death.\nWhat was that voice?\nHe glanced back across the chasm, toward where Sadeas—well\noutside of bow range—sat with his attendants. Dalinar could sense the\ndisapproval in his ex-friend’s posture. Dalinar and Adolin risked\nthemselves, taking a dangerous leap across the chasm. An assault of the\ntype Sadeas had pioneered would cost more lives. But how many lives\nwould Dalinar’s army lose if one of its Shardbearers was pushed into the\nchasm?\nGallant charged across the bridge alongside a line of soldiers, who\ncheered for the Ryshadium. He slowed near Dalinar, who grabbed the reins.\nRight now, he was needed. His men were fighting and dying, and this was\nnot a time for regret or second-guessing.\nA Plate-enhanced jump put him in the saddle. Then, Shardblade raised\nhigh, he charged into battle to kill for his men. That was not what the\nRadiants had fought for. But at least it was something.\nThey won the battle.\nDalinar stepped back, feeling fatigued as Adolin did the honors of\nharvesting the gemheart. The chrysalis itself sat like an enormous, oblong\nrockbud, fifteen feet tall and attached to the uneven stone ground by\nsomething that looked like crem. There were bodies all around it, some\nhuman, others Parshendi. The Parshendi had tried to get into it quickly and\nflee, but they’d only managed to get a few cracks into the shell.\nThe fighting had been most furious here, around the chrysalis. Dalinar\nrested back against a shelf of rock and pulled his helm off, exposing a\nsweaty head to the cool breeze. The sun was high overhead; the battle had\nlasted two hours or so.\nAdolin worked efficiently, using his Shardblade with care to shave off\na section of the outside of the chrysalis. Then he expertly plunged it in,\nkilling the pupating creature but avoiding the region with the gemheart.\nJust like that, the creature was dead. Now the Shardblade could cut it,\nand Adolin carved away sections of flesh. Purple ichor spurted out as he\nreached in, questing for the gemheart. The soldiers cheered as he pulled it\nfree, gloryspren hovering above the entire army like hundreds of spheres of\nlight.\nDalinar found himself walking away, helm held in his left hand. He\ncrossed the battlefield, passing surgeons tending the wounded and teams\nwho were carrying his dead back to the bridges.

Just exhausted.\nHe’d gone to battle dozens, perhaps hundreds of times. Never before\nhad he felt as he had this day. That revulsion had distracted him, and that\ncould have gotten him killed. Battle was no time for reflection; you had\nto keep your mind on what you were doing.\nThe Thrill had seemed subdued the entire battle, and he hadn’t fought\nnearly as well as he once had. This battle should have brought him clarity.\nInstead, his troubles seemed magnified. Blood of my fathers, he thought,\nstepping up to the top of a small rock hill. What is happening to me?\nHis weakness today seemed the latest, and most potent, argument to\nfuel what Adolin—and, indeed, what many others—said about him. He\nstood atop the hill, looking eastward, toward the Origin. His eyes went that\ndirection so often. Why? What was—\nHe froze, noticing a group of Parshendi on a nearby plateau. His scouts\nwatched them warily; it was the army that Dalinar’s people had driven off.\nThough they’d killed a lot of Parshendi today, the vast majority had still\nescaped, retreating when they realized the battle was lost to them. That was\none of the reasons the war was lasting so long. The Parshendi understood\nstrategic retreat.\nThis army stood in ranks, grouped in warpairs. A commanding figure\nstood at their head, a large Parshendi in glittering armor. Shardplate. Even\nat a distance, it was easy to tell the difference between it and something\nmore mundane.\nThat Shardbearer hadn’t been here during the battle itself. Why come\nnow? Had he arrived too late?\nThe armored figure and the rest of the Parshendi turned and left,\nleaping across the chasm behind them and fleeing back toward their unseen\nhaven at the center of the Plains.\nIf anything I have said makes a glimmer of sense to you, I trust that\nyou’ll call them off. Or maybe you could astound me and ask them to\ndo something productive for once.\nKaladin pushed his way into the apothecary’s shop, the door banging shut\nbehind him. As before, the aged man pretended to be feeble, feeling his way\nwith a cane until he recognized Kaladin. Then he stood up straighter. “Oh.\nIt’s you.”\nIt had been two more long days. Daytime spent working and training\n—Teft and Rock now practiced with him—evenings spent at the first\nchasm, retrieving the reeds from their hiding place in a crevice and then\nmilking for hours. Gaz had seen them go down last night, and the bridge\nsergeant was undoubtedly suspicious. There was no helping that.\nBridge Four had been called out on a bridge run today. Thankfully,\nthey’d arrived before the Parshendi, and none of the bridge crews had lost\nany men. Things hadn’t gone so well for the regular Alethi troops. The\nAlethi line had eventually buckled before the Parshendi assault, and the\nbridge crews had been forced to lead a tired, angry, and defeated troop of\nsoldiers back to the camp.\nKaladin was bleary-eyed with fatigue from staying up late working on"

His stomach growled perpetually from being given a fraction of\nthe food it needed, as he shared his meals with two wounded. That all ended\ntoday. The apothecary walked back behind his counter, and Kaladin stepped\nup to it. Syl darted into the room, her small ribbon of light turning into a\nwoman midtwist. She flipped like an acrobat, landing on the table in a\nsmooth motion.\n“What do you need?” the apothecary asked. “More bandages? Well, I\nmight just—”\nHe cut off as Kaladin slapped a medium-sized liquor bottle down on\nthe table. It had a cracked top, but would still hold a cork. He pulled this\nfree, revealing the milky white knobweed sap inside. He’d used the first of\nwhat they’d harvested to treat Leyten, Dabbid, and Hobber.\n“What’s this?” the elderly apothecary asked, adjusting his spectacles\nand leaning down. “Offering me a drink? I don’t take the stuff these days.\nUnsettles the stomach, you know.”\n“It’s not liquor. It’s knobweed sap. You said it was expensive. Well,\nhow much will you give me for this?”\nThe apothecary blinked, then leaned in closer, giving the contents a\nwhiff. “Where’d you get this?”\n“I harvested it from the reeds growing outside of camp.”\nThe apothecary’s expression darkened. He shrugged. “Worthless, I’m\nafraid.”\n“What?”\n“The wild weeds aren’t potent enough.” The apothecary replaced the\ncork. A strong wind buffeted the building, blowing under the door, stirring\nthe scents of the many powders and tonics he sold. “This is practically\nuseless. I’ll give you two clearmarks for it, which is being generous. I’ll\nhave to distill it, and will be lucky to get a couple of spoonfuls.”\nTwo marks! Kaladin thought with despair. After three days of work,\nthree of us pushing ourselves, getting only a few hours of sleep each night?\nAll for something worth only a couple days’ wage?\nBut no. The sap had worked on Leyten’s wound, making the rotspren\nflee and the infection retreat. Kaladin narrowed his eyes as the apothecary\nfished two marks out of his money pouch, setting them on the table. Like\nmany spheres, these were flattened slightly on one side to keep them from\nrolling away.\n“Actually,” the apothecary said, rubbing his chin. “I’ll give you three.”\nHe took out one more mark. “Hate to see all of your effort go to waste.”\n“Kaladin,” Syl said, studying the apothecary. “He’s nervous about\nsomething. I think he’s lying!”\n“I know,” Kaladin said.\n“What’s that?” the apothecary said. “Well, if you knew it was\nworthless, why did you spend so much effort on it?” He reached for the\nbottle.\nKaladin caught his hand. “We got two or more drops from each reed,\nyou know.”\nThe apothecary frowned."

You said\nnothing about ‘wild’ plants being weaker.”\n“Well, I didn’t think you’d go and try gathering them, and…” He\ntrailed off as Kaladin locked eyes with him.\n“The army doesn’t know, do they?” Kaladin asked. “They aren’t aware\nhow valuable those plants outside are. You harvest them, you sell the sap,\nand you make a killing, since the military needs a lot of antiseptic.”\nThe old apothecary cursed, pulling his hand back. “I don’t know what\nyou’re talking about.”\nKaladin took his jar. “And if I go to the healing tent and tell them\nwhere I got this?”\n“They’d take it from you!” the man said urgently. “Don’t be a fool.\nYou’ve a slave brand, boy. They’ll think you stole it.”\nKaladin moved to walk away.\n“I’ll give a skymark,” the apothecary said. “That’s half what I’d charge\nthe military for this much.”\nKaladin turned. “You charge them two skymarks for something that\nonly takes a couple of days to gather?”\n“It’s not just me,” the apothecary said, scowling. “Each of the\napothecaries charges the same. We got together, decided on a fair price.”\n“How is that a fair price?”\n“We have to make a living here, in this Almighty-forsaken land! It\ncosts us money to set up shop, to maintain ourselves, to hire guards.”\nHe fished in his pouch, pulling out a sphere that glowed deep blue. A\nsapphire sphere was worth about twenty-five times a diamond one. As\nKaladin made one diamond mark a day, a skymark was worth as much as\nKaladin made in half a month. Of course, a common darkeyed soldier\nearned five clearmarks a day, which would make this a week’s wages to\nthem.\nOnce, this wouldn’t have seemed like much money to Kaladin. Now it\nwas a fortune. Still, he hesitated. “I should expose you. Men die because of\nyou.”\n“No they don’t,” the apothecary said. “The highprinces have more than\nenough to pay this, considering what they make on the plateaus. We supply\nthem with bottles of sap as often as they need them. All you’d do by\nexposing us is let monsters like Sadeas keep a few more spheres in their\npockets!”\nThe apothecary was sweating. Kaladin was threatening to topple his\nentire business on the Shattered Plains. And so much money was being\nearned on the sap that this could grow very dangerous. Men killed to keep\nsuch secrets.\n“Line my pocket or line the brightlords’,” Kaladin said. “I guess I can’t\nargue with that logic.” He set the bottle back on the counter. “I’ll take the\ndeal, provided you throw in some more bandages.”\n“Very well,” the apothecary said, relaxing. “But stay away from those"

I’m surprised you found any nearby that hadn’t already been\nharvested. My workers are having an increasingly difficult time.”\nThey don’t have a windspren guiding them, Kaladin thought. “Then\nwhy would you want to discourage me? I could get more of this for you.”\n“Well, yes,” the apothecary said. “But—”\n“It’s cheaper if you do it yourself,” Kaladin said, leaning down. “But\nthis way you have a clean trail. I provide the sap, charging one skymark. If\nthe lighteyes ever discover what the apothecaries have been doing, you can\nclaim ignorance—all you know is that some bridgeman was selling you sap,\nand you resold it to the army at a reasonable markup.”\nThat seemed to appeal to the old man. “Well, perhaps I won’t ask too\nmany questions about how you harvested this. Your business, young man.\nYour business indeed….” He shuffled to the back of his store, returning\nwith a box of bandages. Kaladin accepted it and left the shop without a\nword.\n“Aren’t you worried?” Syl said, floating up beside his head as he\nentered the afternoon sunlight. “If Gaz discovers what you’re doing, you\ncould get into trouble.”\n“What more could they do to me?” Kaladin asked. “I doubt they’d\nconsider this a crime worth stringing me up for.”\nSyl looked backward, forming into little more than a cloud with the\nfaint suggestion of a female form. “I can’t decide if it’s dishonest or not.”\n“It’s not dishonest; it’s business.” He grimaced. “Lavis grain is sold the\nsame way. Grown by the farmers and sold at a pittance to merchants, who\ncarry it to the cities and sell it to other merchants, who sell it to people for\nfour or five times what it was originally bought for.”\n“So why did it bother you?” Syl asked, frowning as they avoided a\ntroop of soldiers, one of whom tossed the pit of a palafruit at Kaladin’s\nhead. The soldiers laughed.\nKaladin rubbed his temple. “I’ve still got some strange scruples about\ncharging for medical care because of my father.”\n“He sounds like he’s a very generous man.”\n“For all the good it did him.”\nOf course, in a way, Kaladin was just as bad. During his early days as\na slave, he’d have done almost anything for a chance to walk around\nunsupervised like this. The army perimeter was guarded, but if he could\nsneak the knobweed in, he could probably find a way to sneak himself out.\nWith that sapphire mark, he even had money to aid him. Yes, he had\nthe slave brand, but some quick if painful work with a knife could turn that\ninto a “battle scar” instead. He could talk and fight like a soldier, so it\nwould be plausible. He’d be taken for a deserter, but he could live with that.\nThat had been his plan for most of the later months of his enslavement,\nbut he’d never had the means.

Money to\nbuy lodging in a seedy section of town, a place where nobody asked\nquestions, while he healed from his self-inflicted wound.\nIn addition, there had always been the others. So he’d stayed, trying to\nget as many out as he could. Failing every time. And he was doing it again.\n“Kaladin?” Syl asked from his shoulder. “You look very serious. What\nare you thinking?”\n“I’m wondering if I should run. Escape this storm-cursed camp and\nfind myself a new life.”\nSyl fell silent. “Life is hard here,” she finally said. “I don’t know if\nanyone would blame you.”\nRock would, he thought. And Teft. They’d worked for that knobweed\nsap. They didn’t know what it was worth; they thought it was only for\nhealing the sick. If he ran, he’d be betraying them. He’d be abandoning the\nbridgemen.\nShove over, you fool, Kaladin thought to himself. You won’t save these\nbridgemen. Just like you didn’t save Tien. You should run.\n“And then what?” he whispered.\nSyl turned to him. “What?”\nIf he ran, what good would it do? A life working for chips in the\nunderbelly of some rotting city? No.\nHe couldn’t leave them. Just like he’d never been able to leave anyone\nwho he’d thought needed him. He had to protect them. He had to.\nFor Tien. And for his own sanity.\n“Chasm duty,” Gaz said, spitting to the side. The spittle was colored black\nfrom the yamma plant he chewed.\n“What?” Kaladin had returned from selling the knobweed to discover\nthat Gaz had changed Bridge Four’s work detail. They weren’t scheduled to\nbe on duty for any bridge runs—their run the day before exempted them.\nInstead, they were supposed to be assigned to Sadeas’s smithy to help lift\ningots and other supplies.\nThat sounded like difficult work, but it was actually among the easiest\njobs bridgemen got. The blacksmiths felt they didn’t need the extra hands.\nThat, or they presumed that clumsy bridgemen would just get in the way.\nOn smithy duty, you usually only worked a few hours of the shift and could\nspend the rest lounging.\nGaz stood with Kaladin in the early afternoon sunlight. “You see,” Gaz\nsaid, “you got me thinking the other day. Nobody cares if Bridge Four is\ngiven unfair work details. Everyone hates chasm duty. I figured you\nwouldn’t care.”\n“How much did they pay you?” Kaladin asked, stepping forward.\n“Storm off,” Gaz said, spitting again. “The others resent you. It’ll do\nyour crew good to be seen paying for what you did.”\n“Surviving?”\nGaz shrugged. “Everyone knows you broke the rules in bringing back\nthose men. If the others do what you did, we’d have each barrack filled with\nthe dying before the leeward side of a month was over!”\n“They’re people, Gaz. If we don’t ‘fill the barracks’ with wounded, it’s\nbecause we’re leaving them out there to die.”"

If we don’t ‘fill the barracks’ with wounded, it’s\nbecause we’re leaving them out there to die.”\n“They’ll die here anyway.”\n“We’ll see.”\nGaz watched him, eyes narrow. It seemed like he suspected that\nKaladin had somehow tricked him in taking the stone-gathering duty.\nEarlier, Gaz had apparently gone down to the chasm, probably trying to\nfigure out what Kaladin and the other two had been doing.\nDamnation, Kaladin thought. He’d thought he had Gaz cowed enough\nto stay in line. “We’ll go,” Kaladin snapped, turning away. “But I’m not\ntaking the blame among my men for this one. They’ll know you did it.”\n“Fine,” Gaz called after him. Then, to himself, he continued, “Maybe\nI’ll get lucky and a chasmfiend will eat the lot of you.”\nChasm duty. Most bridgemen would rather spend all day hauling stones\nthan get assigned to the chasms.\nWith an unlit oil-soaked torch tied to his back, Kaladin climbed down\nthe precarious rope ladder. The chasm was shallow here, only about fifty\nfeet down, but that was enough to take him into a different world. A world\nwhere the only natural light came from the rift high in the sky. A world that\nstayed damp on even the hottest days, a drowned landscape of moss,\nfungus, and hardy plants that survived in even dim light.\nThe chasms were wider at the bottom, perhaps a result of highstorms.\nThey caused enormous floods to crash through the chasms; to be caught in a\nchasm during a highstorm was death. A sediment of hardened crem\nsmoothed the pathway on the floor of the chasms, though it rose and fell\nwith the varying erosion of the underlying rock. In some few places, the\ndistance from the chasm floor to the edge of the plateau above was only\nabout forty feet. In most places, however, it was closer to a hundred or\nmore.\nKaladin jumped off the ladder, falling a few feet and landing with a\nsplash in a puddle of rainwater. After lighting the torch, he held it high,\npeering along the caliginous rift. The sides were slick with a dark green\nmoss, and several thin vines he didn’t recognize trailed down from\nintermediate ledges above. Bits of bone, wood, and torn cloth lay strewn\nabout or wedged into clefts.\nSomeone splashed to the ground beside him. Teft cursed, looking\ndown at his soaked legs and trousers as he stepped out of the large puddle.\n“Storms take that cremling Gaz,” the aging bridgeman muttered. “Sending\nus down here when it isn’t our turn. I’ll have his beans for this.”\n“I am certain that he is very scared of you,” Rock said, stepping down\noff the ladder onto a dry spot. “Is probably back in camp crying in fear.”\n“Storm off,” Teft said, shaking the water from his left leg.

They needed to ration the torches.\nThe other men of Bridge Four began to gather near the bottom of the\nladder, staying in a clump. Every fourth man lit his torch, but the light\ndidn’t do much to dispel the gloom; it just allowed Kaladin to see more of\nthe unnatural landscape. Strange, tube-shaped fungi grew in cracks. They\nwere a wan yellow, like the skin of a child with jaundice. Scuttling\ncremlings moved away from the light. The tiny crustaceans were a\ntranslucent reddish color; as one scrambled past on the wall, he realized that\nhe could see its internal organs through its shell.\nThe light also revealed a twisted, broken figure at the base of the\nchasm wall a short distance away. Kaladin raised his torch and stepped up\nto it. It was beginning to stink already. He raised a hand, unconsciously\ncovering his nose and mouth as he knelt down.\nIt was a bridgeman, or had been, from one of the other crews. He was\nfresh. If he’d been here longer than a few days, the highstorm would have\nwashed him away to some distant place. Bridge Four gathered behind\nKaladin, looking silently at the one who had chosen to throw himself into\nthe chasm.\n“May you someday find a place of honor in the Tranquiline Halls,\nfallen brother,” Kaladin said, his voice echoing. “And may we find a better\nend than you.” He stood, holding his torch high, and led the way past the\ndead sentry. His crew followed nervously.\nKaladin had quickly understood the basic tactics of fighting on the\nShattered Plains. You wanted to advance forcefully, pressing your enemy to\nthe plateau’s edge. That was why the battles often turned bloody for the\nAlethi, who usually arrived after the Parshendi.\nThe Alethi had bridges, while these odd Eastern parshmen could leap\nmost chasms, given a running start. But both had trouble when squeezed\ntoward the cliffs, and that generally resulted in soldiers losing their footing\nand tumbling into the void. The numbers were significant enough for the\nAlethi to want to recover lost equipment. And so bridgemen were sent on\nchasm duty. It was like barrow robbing, only without the barrows.\nThey carried sacks, and would spend hours walking around, looking\nfor the corpses of the fallen, searching for anything of value. Spheres,\nbreastplates, caps, weapons. Some days, when a plateau run was recent,\nthey could try to make their way all the way out to where it had happened\nand scavenge from those bodies. But highstorms generally made that futile.\nWait even a few days, and the bodies would be washed someplace else.\nBeyond that, the chasms were a bewildering maze, and getting to a\nspecific contested plateau and then returning in a reasonable time was near\nimpossible. General wisdom was to wait for a highstorm to push the bodies\ntoward the Alethi side of the Plains—highstorms always came east to west,\nafter all—and then send bridgemen down to search them out.\nThat meant a lot of random wandering.

But over the years, enough\nbodies had fallen that it wasn’t too difficult to find places to harvest. The\ncrew was required to bring up a specific amount of salvage or face docked\npay for the week, but the quota wasn’t onerous. Enough to keep the\nbridgemen working, but not enough to force them to fully exert themselves.\nLike most bridgeman work, this was meant to keep them occupied as much\nas anything else.\nAs they walked down the first chasm, some of his men got out their\nsacks and picked up pieces of salvage they passed. A helmet here, a shield\nthere. They kept a keen watch for spheres. Finding a valuable fallen sphere\nwould result in a small reward for the whole crew. They weren’t allowed to\nbring their own spheres or possessions into the chasm, of course. And on\ntheir way out, they were searched thoroughly. The humiliation of that\nsearch—which included any place a sphere might be hidden—was part of\nthe reason chasm duty was so loathed.\nBut only a part. As they walked, the chasm floor widened to about\nfifteen feet. Here, marks scarred the walls, gashes where the moss had been\nscraped away, the stone itself scored. The bridgemen tried not to look at\nthose marks. Occasionally, chasmfiends stalked these pathways, searching\nfor either carrion or a suitable plateau to pupate upon. Encountering one of\nthem was uncommon, but possible.\n“Kelek, but I hate this place,” Teft said, walking beside Kaladin. “I\nheard that once an entire bridge crew got eaten by a chasmfiend, one at a\ntime, after it backed them into a dead end. It just sat there, picking them off\nas they tried to run past.”\nRock chuckled. “If they were all eaten, then who was returning to tell\nthis story?”\nTeft rubbed his chin. “I dunno. Maybe they just never returned.”\n“Then perhaps they fled. Deserting.”\n“No,” Teft said. “You can’t get out of these chasms without a ladder.”\nHe glanced upward, toward the narrow rift of blue seventy feet above,\nfollowing the curve of the plateau.\nKaladin glanced up as well. That blue sky seemed so distant.\nUnreachable. Like the light of the Halls themselves. And even if you could\nclimb out at one of the shallower areas, you’d either be trapped on the\nPlains without a way to cross chasms, or you’d be close enough to the\nAlethi side that the scouts would spot you crossing the permanent bridges.\nYou could try going eastward, toward where the plateaus were worn away\nto the point that they were just spires. But that would take weeks of\nwalking, and would require surviving multiple highstorms.\n“You ever been in a slot canyon when rains come, Rock?” Teft asked,\nperhaps thinking along the same lines.\n“No,” Rock replied. “On the Peaks, we have not these things. They\nonly exist where foolish men choose to live.”\n“You live here, Rock,” Kaladin noted.\n“And I am foolish,” the large Horneater said, chuckling. “Did you not"

He\nwas more affable, returning in some measure to what Kaladin assumed was\nhis normal personality.\n“I was talking,” Teft said, “about slot canyons. You want to guess what\nwill happen if we get trapped down here in a highstorm?”\n“Lots of water, I guess,” Rock said.\n“Lots of water, looking to go any place it can,” Teft said. “It gathers\ninto enormous waves and goes crashing through these confined spaces with\nenough force to toss boulders. In fact, an ordinary rain will feel like a\nhighstorm down here. A highstorm…well, this would probably be the worst\nplace in Roshar to be when one hits.”\nRock frowned at that, glancing upward. “Best not to be caught in the\nstorm, then.”\n“Yeah,” Teft said.\n“Though, Teft,” Rock added, “it would give you bath, which you very\nmuch need.”\n“Hey,” Teft grumbled. “Is that a comment on how I smell?”\n“No,” Rock said. “Is comment on what I have to smell. Sometimes, I\nam thinking that a Parshendi arrow in the eye would be better than smelling\nentire bridge crew enclosed in barrack at night!”\nTeft chuckled. “I’d take offense at that if it weren’t true.” He sniffed at\nthe damp, moldy chasm air. “This place ain’t much better. It smells worse\nthan a Horneater’s boots in winter down here.” He hesitated. “Er, no\noffense. I mean personally.”\nKaladin smiled, then glanced back. The thirty or so other bridgemen\nfollowed like ghosts. A few seemed to be edging close to Kaladin’s group,\nas if trying to listen in without being obvious.\n“Teft,” Kaladin said. “‘Smells worse than a Horneater’s boots’? How\nin the Halls isn’t he supposed to take offense at that phrase?”\n“It’s just an expression,” Teft said, scowling. “It was out of my mouth\nbefore I realized what I was saying.”\n“Alas,” Rock said, pulling a tuft of moss off the wall, inspecting it as\nthey walked. “Your insult has offended me. If we were at the Peaks, we\nwould have to duel in the traditional alil’tiki’i fashion.”\n“Which is what?” Teft asked. “With spears?”\nRock laughed. “No, no. We upon the Peaks are not barbarians like you\ndown here.”\n“How then?” Kaladin asked, genuinely curious.\n“Well,” Rock said, dropping the moss and dusting off his hands, “is\ninvolving much mudbeer and singing.”\n“How’s that a duel?”\n“He who can still sing after the most drinks is winner. Plus, soon,\neveryone is so drunk that they probably forget what argument was about.”\nTeft laughed. “Beats knives at dawn, I suppose.”\n“I guess that depends,” Kaladin said.\n“Upon what?” Teft asked.\n“On whether or not you’re a knife merchant.

The spindly youth jumped and blushed. “Er—I—”\nRock chuckled at Kaladin’s words. “Dunny,” he said to the youth. “Is\nodd name. What is meaning of it?”\n“Meaning?” Dunny asked. “I don’t know. Names don’t always have a\nmeaning.”\nRock shook his head, displeased. “Lowlanders. How are you to know\nwho you are if your name has no meaning?”\n“So your name means something?” Teft asked. “Nu…ma…nu…”\n“Numuhukumakiaki’aialunamor,” Rock said, the native Horneater\nsounds flowing easily from his lips. “Of course. Is description of very\nspecial rock my father discovered the day before my birth.”\n“So your name is a whole sentence?” Dunny asked, uncertain—as if he\nwasn’t sure he belonged.\n“Is poem,” Rock said. “On the Peaks, everyone’s name is poem.”\n“Is that so?” Teft said, scratching at his beard. “Must make calling the\nfamily at mealtime a bit of a chore.”\nRock laughed. “True, true. Is also making for some interesting\narguments. Usually, the best insults on the Peaks are in the form of a poem,\none which is similar in composition and rhyme to the person’s name.”\n“Kelek,” Teft muttered. “Sounds like a lot of work.”\n“Is why most arguments end in drinking, perhaps,” Rock said.\nDunny smiled hesitantly. “Hey you big buffoon, you smell like a wet\nhog, so go out by the moon, and jump yourself in the bog.”\nRock laughed riotously, his booming voice echoing down the chasm.\n“Is good, is good,” he said, wiping his eyes. “Simple, but good.”\n“That almost had the sound of a song to it, Dunny,” Kaladin said.\n“Well, it was the first thing that came to mind. I put it to the tune of\n‘Mari’s Two Lovers’ to get the beat right.”\n“You can sing?” Rock asked. “I must be hearing.”\n“But—” Dunny said.\n“Sing!” Rock commanded, pointing.\nDunny yelped, but obeyed, breaking into a song that wasn’t familiar to\nKaladin. It was an amusing tale involving a woman and twin brothers who\nshe thought were the same person. Dunny’s voice was a pure tenor, and he\nseemed to have more confidence when he sang than when he spoke.\nHe was good. Once he moved to the second verse, Rock began\nhumming in a deep voice, providing a harmony. The Horneater was\nobviously very practiced at song. Kaladin glanced back at the other\nbridgemen, hoping to pull some more into the conversation or the song. He\nsmiled at Skar, but got only a scowl in return. Moash and Sigzil—the dark-\nskinned Azish man—wouldn’t even look at him. Peet looked only at his\nfeet.\nWhen the song was finished, Teft clapped appreciatively. “That’s a"

This particular chasm didn’t seem\nto have much in the way of salvage this time. “I had begun thinking you\nwere all as tone deaf as my father’s old axehound. Ha!”\nDunny blushed, but seemed to walk more confidently.\nThey continued, occasionally passing turns or rifts in the stone where\nthe waters had deposited large clusters of salvage. Here, the work turned\nmore gruesome, and they’d often have to pull out corpses or piles of bones\nto get what they wanted, gagging at the scent. Kaladin told them to leave\nthe more sickening or rotted bodies for now. Rotspren tended to cluster\naround the dead. If they didn’t find enough salvage later, they could get\nthose on the way back.\nAt every intersection or branch, Kaladin made a white mark on the\nwall with a piece of chalk. That was the bridgeleader’s duty, and he took it\nseriously. He wouldn’t have his crew getting lost out in these rifts.\nAs they walked and worked, Kaladin kept the conversation going. He\nlaughed—forced himself to laugh—with them. If that laugher felt hollow to\nhim, the others didn’t seem to notice. Perhaps they felt as he did, that even\nforced laughter was preferable to going back to the self-absorbed, mournful\nsilence that cloaked most bridgemen.\nBefore long, Dunny was laughing and talking with Teft and Rock, his\nshyness faded. A few others hovered just behind—Yake, Maps, a couple of\nothers—like wild creatures drawn to the light and warmth of a fire. Kaladin\ntried to draw them into the conversation, but it didn’t work, so eventually he\njust let them be.\nEventually, they reached a place with a significant number of fresh\ncorpses. Kaladin wasn’t sure what combination of waterflow had made this\nsection of chasm a good place for that—it looked the same as other\nstretches. A little narrower perhaps. Sometimes they could go to the same\nnooks and find good salvage there; other times, those were empty, but other\nplaces would have dozens of corpses.\nThese bodies looked like they’d floated in the wash of the highstorm\nflood, then been deposited as the water slowly receded. There were no\nParshendi among them, and they were broken and torn from either their fall\nor the crush of the flood. Many were missing limbs.\nThe stink of blood and viscera hung in the humid air. Kaladin held his\ntorch aloft as his companions fell silent. The dank chill kept the bodies from\nrotting too quickly, though the dampness counteracted some of that. The\ncremlings had begun chewing the skin off hands and gnawing out the eyes.\nSoon the stomachs would bloat with gas. Some rotspren—tiny, red,\ntranslucent—scrambled across the corpses.\nSyl floated down and landed on his shoulder, making disgusted noises.\nAs usual, she offered no explanation for her absence."

Even with the rotspren, this was too rich a\nplace to pass up. They went to work, pulling the corpses into a line so they\ncould be inspected. Kaladin waved for Rock and Teft to join him as he\npicked up some stray bits of salvage that lay on the ground around the\ncorpses. Dunny tagged along.\n“Those bodies wear the highprince’s colors,” Rock noted as Kaladin\npicked up a dented steel cap.\n“I’ll bet they’re from that run a few days back,” Kaladin said. “It went\nbadly for Sadeas’s forces.”\n“Brightlord Sadeas,” Dunny said. Then he ducked his head in\nembarrassment. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to correct you. I used to forget to say\nthe title. My master beat me when I did.”\n“Master?” Teft asked, picking up a fallen spear and pulling some moss\noff its shaft.\n“I was an apprentice. I mean, before…” Dunny trailed off, then looked\naway.\nTeft had been right; bridgemen didn’t like talking about their pasts.\nAnyway, Dunny was probably right to correct him. Kaladin would be\npunished if he were heard omitting a lighteyes’s honorific.\nKaladin put the cap in his sack, then rammed his torch into a gap\nbetween two moss-covered boulders and started helping the others get the\nbodies into a line. He didn’t prod the men toward conversation. The fallen\ndeserved some reverence—if that was possible while robbing them.\nNext, the bridgemen stripped the fallen of their armor. Leather vests\nfrom the archers, steel breastplates from the foot soldiers. This group\nincluded a lighteyes in fine clothing beneath even finer armor. Sometimes\nthe bodies of fallen lighteyes would be recovered from the chasms by\nspecial teams so the corpse could be Soulcast into a statue. Darkeyes, unless\nthey were very wealthy, were burned. And most soldiers who fell into the\nchasms were ignored; the men in camp spoke of the chasms being hallowed\nresting places, but the truth was that the effort to get the bodies out wasn’t\nworth the cost or the danger.\nRegardless, to find a lighteyes here meant that his family hadn’t been\nwealthy enough, or concerned enough, to send men out to recover him. His\nface was crushed beyond recognition, but his rank insignia identified him as\nseventh dahn. Landless, attached to a more powerful officer’s retinue.\nOnce they had his armor, they pulled daggers and boots off everyone\nin line—boots were always in demand. They left the fallen their clothing,\nthough they took off the belts and cut free many shirt buttons. As they\nworked, Kaladin sent Teft and Rock around the bend to see if there were\nany other bodies nearby.\nOnce the armor, weapons, and boots had been separated, the most\ngrisly task began: searching pockets and pouches for spheres and jewelry.\nThis pile was the smallest of the lot, but valuable. They didn’t find any\nbroams, which meant no pitiful reward for the bridgemen."

He hesitated there, holding the spear over the pile with\none hand, cold water dripping from it. He rubbed his finger along the\nsmooth wood. He could tell from the heft, balance, and sanding that it was a\ngood weapon. Sturdy, well made, well kept.\nHe closed his eyes, remembering days as a boy holding a quarterstaff.\nWords spoken by Tukks years ago returned to him, words spoken on\nthat bright summer day when he’d first held a weapon in Amaram’s army.\nThe first step is to care, Tukks’s voice seemed to whisper. Some talk about\nbeing emotionless in battle. Well, I suppose it’s important to keep your head.\nBut I hate that feeling of killing while calm and cold. I’ve seen that those\nwho care fight harder, longer, and better than those who don’t. It’s the\ndifference between mercenaries and real soldiers. It’s the difference\nbetween fighting to defend your homeland and fighting on foreign soil.\nIt’s good to care when you fight, so long as you don’t let it consume\nyou. Don’t try to stop yourself from feeling. You’ll hate who you become.\nThe spear quivered in Kaladin’s fingers, as if begging him to swing it,\nspin it, dance with it.\n“What are you planning to do, lordling?” a voice called. “Going to ram\nthat spear into your own gut?”\nKaladin glanced up at the speaker. Moash—still one of Kaladin’s\nbiggest detractors—stood near the line of corpses. How had he known to\ncall Kaladin “lordling”? Had he been talking to Gaz?\n“He claims he’s a deserter,” Moash said to Narm, the man working\nnext to him. “Says he was some important soldier, a squadleader or the like.\nBut Gaz says that’s all stupid boasting. They wouldn’t send a man to the\nbridges if he actually knew how to fight.”\nKaladin lowered the spear.\nMoash smirked, turning back to his work. Others, however, had now\nnoticed Kaladin. “Look at him,” Sigzil said. “Ho, bridgeleader! You think\nthat you’re grand? That you are better than us? You think pretending that\nwe’re your own personal troop of soldiers will change anything?”\n“Leave him alone,” Drehy said. He shoved Sigzil as he passed. “At\nleast he tries.”\nEarless Jacks snorted, pulling a boot free from a dead foot. “He cares\nabout looking important. Even if he was in the army, I’ll bet he spent his\ndays cleaning out latrines.”\nIt appeared that there was something that would pull the bridgemen out\nof their silent stupors: loathing for Kaladin. Others began talking, calling\ngibes.\n“…his fault we’re down here…”\n“…wants to run us ragged during our only free time, just so he can feel\nimportant…”"

Maybe if he’d never picked up that first\nspear, none of this would have happened.\nHe felt the smooth wood, slick with rainwater, memories jumbling in\nhis head. Training to forget, training to get vengeance, training to learn and\nmake sense of what had happened.\nWithout thinking about it, he snapped the spear up under his arm into a\nguard position, point down. Water droplets from its length sprayed across\nhis back.\nMoash cut off in the middle of another gibe. The bridgemen sputtered\nto a stop. The chasm became quiet.\nAnd Kaladin was in another place.\nHe was listening to Tukks chide him.\nHe was listening to Tien laugh.\nHe was hearing his mother tease him in her clever, witty way.\nHe was on the battlefield, surrounded by enemies but ringed by\nfriends.\nHe was listening to his father tell him with a sneer in his voice that\nspears were only for killing. You could not kill to protect.\nHe was alone in a chasm deep beneath the earth, holding the spear of a\nfallen man, fingers gripping the wet wood, a faint dripping coming from\nsomewhere distant.\nStrength surged through him as he spun the spear up into an advanced\nkata. His body moved of its own accord, going through the forms he’d\ntrained in so frequently. The spear danced in his fingers, comfortable, an\nextension of himself. He spun with it, swinging it around and around, across\nhis neck, over his arm, in and out of jabs and swings. Though it had been\nmonths since he’d even held a weapon, his muscles knew what to do. It was\nas if the spear itself knew what to do.\nTension melted away, frustration melted away, and his body sighed in\ncontentment even as he worked it furiously. This was familiar. This was\nwelcome. This was what it had been created to do.\nMen had always told Kaladin that he fought like nobody else. He’d felt\nit on the first day he’d picked up a quarterstaff, though Tukks’s advice had\nhelped him refine and channel what he could do. Kaladin had cared when\nhe fought. He’d never fought empty or cold. He fought to keep his men\nalive.\nOf all the recruits in his cohort, he had learned the quickest. How to\nhold the spear, how to stand to spar. He’d done it almost without\ninstruction. That had shocked Tukks. But why should it have? You were not\nshocked when a child knew how to breathe. You were not shocked when a\nskyeel took flight for the first time. You should not be shocked when you\nhand Kaladin Stormblessed a spear and he knows how to use it.\nKaladin spun through the last motions of the kata, chasm forgotten,\nbridgemen forgotten, fatigue forgotten. For a moment, it was just him. Him"

He fought with her, and she laughed.\nHe snapped the spear back into place, holding the haft at the one-\nquarter position, spearhead down, bottom of the haft tucked underneath his\narm, end rising back behind his head. He breathed in deeply, shivering.\nOh, how I’ve missed that.\nHe opened his eyes. Sputtering torchlight revealed a group of stunned\nbridgemen standing in a damp corridor of stone, the walls wet and reflecting\nthe light. Moash dropped a handful of spheres in stunned silence, staring at\nKaladin with mouth agape. Those spheres plopped into the puddle at his\nfeet, causing it to glow, but none of the bridgemen noticed. They just stared\nat Kaladin, who was still in a battle stance, half crouched, trails of sweat\nrunning down the sides of his face.\nHe blinked, realizing what he’d done. If word got back to Gaz that he\nwas playing around with spears…Kaladin stood up straight and dropped the\nspear into the pile of weapons. “Sorry,” he whispered to it, though he didn’t\nknow why. Then, louder, he said, “Back to work! I don’t want to be caught\ndown here when night falls.”\nThe bridgemen jumped into motion. Down the chasm corridor, he saw\nRock and Teft. Had they seen the entire kata? Flushing, Kaladin hurried up\nto them. Syl landed on his shoulder, silent.\n“Kaladin, lad,” Teft said reverently. “That was—”\n“It was meaningless,” Kaladin said. “Just a kata. Meant to work the\nmuscles and make you practice the basic jabs, thrusts, and sweeps. It’s a lot\nshowier than it is useful.”\n“But—”\n“No, really,” Kaladin said. “Can you imagine a man swinging a spear\naround his neck like that in combat? He’d be gutted in a second.”\n“Lad,” Teft said. “I’ve seen katas before. But never one like that. The\nway you moved…The speed, the grace…And there was some sort of spren\nzipping around you, between your sweeps, glowing with a pale light. It was\nbeautiful.”\nRock started. “You could see that?”\n“Sure,” Teft said. “Never seen a spren like that. Ask the other men—I\nsaw a few of them pointing.”\nKaladin glanced at his shoulder, frowning at Syl. She sat primly, legs\ncrossed and hands folded atop her knee, pointedly not looking at him.\n“It was nothing,” Kaladin repeated.\n“No,” Rock said. “That it certainly was not. Perhaps you should\nchallenge Shardbearer. You could become brightlord!”\n“I don’t want to be a brightlord,” Kaladin snapped, perhaps more\nharshly than he should have. The other two jumped. “Besides,” he added,\nlooking away from them. “I tried that once. Where’s Dunny?”\n“Wait,” Teft said, “you—”\n“Where is Dunny?” Kaladin said firmly, punctuating each word.\nStormfather. I need to keep my mouth shut."

I need to keep my mouth shut.\nTeft and Rock shared a glance, then Teft pointed. “We found some\ndead Parshendi around the bend. Thought you’d want to know.”\n“Parshendi,” Kaladin said. “Let’s go look. Might have something\nvaluable.” He’d never looted Parshendi bodies before; fewer of them fell\ninto the chasms than Alethi.\n“Is true,” Rock said, leading the way, carrying a lit torch. “Those\nweapons they have, yes, very nice. And gemstones in their beards.”\n“Not to mention the armor,” Kaladin said.\nRock shook his head. “No armor.”\n“Rock, I’ve seen their armor. They always wear it.”\n“Well, yes, but we cannot use this thing.”\n“I don’t understand,” Kaladin said.\n“Come,” Rock said, gesturing. “Is easier than explaining.”\nKaladin shrugged, and they rounded the corner, Rock scratching at his\nred-bearded chin. “Stupid hairs,” he muttered. “Ah, to have it right again. A\nman is not proper man without proper beard.”\nKaladin rubbed his own beard. One of these days, he’d save up and\nbuy a razor and be rid of the blasted thing. Or, well, probably not. His\nspheres would be needed elsewhere.\nThey rounded the corner and found Dunny pulling the Parshendi\nbodies into a line. There were four of them, and they looked like they’d\nbeen swept in from another direction. There were a few more Alethi bodies\nhere too.\nKaladin strode forward, waving Rock to bring the light, and knelt to\ninspect one of the Parshendi dead. They were like parshmen, with skin in\nmarbled patterns of black and crimson. Their only clothing was knee-length\nblack skirts. Three wore beards, which was unusual for parshmen, and those\nwere woven with uncut gemstones.\nJust as Kaladin had expected, they wore armor of a pale red color.\nBreastplates, helms on the heads, guards on the arms and legs. Extensive\narmor for regular foot soldiers. Some of it was cracked from the fall or the\nwash. It wasn’t metal, then. Painted wood?\n“I thought you said they weren’t armored,” Kaladin said. “What are\nyou trying to tell me? That you don’t dare take it off the dead?”\n“Don’t dare?” Rock said. “Kaladin, Master Brightlord, brilliant\nbridgeleader, spinner of spear, perhaps you will get it off them.”\nKaladin shrugged. His father had instilled in him a familiarity with the\ndead and dying, and though it felt bad to rob the dead, he was not\nsqueamish. He prodded the first Parshendi, noting the man’s knife. He took\nit and looked for the strap that held the shoulder guard in place.\nThere was no strap. Kaladin frowned and peered underneath the guard,\ntrying to pry it up. The skin lifted with it. “Stormfather!” he said. He\ninspected the helm. It was grown into the head. Or grown from the head.\n“What is this?”"

Or grown from the head.\n“What is this?”\n“Do not know,” Rock said, shrugging. “It is looking like they grow\ntheir own armor, eh?”\n“That’s ridiculous,” Kaladin said. “They’re just people. People—even\nparshmen—don’t grow armor.”\n“Parshendi do,” Teft said.\nKaladin and the other two turned to him.\n“Don’t look at me like that,” the older man said with a scowl. “I\nworked in the camp for a few years before I ended up as a bridgeman—no,\nI’m not going to tell you how, so storm off. Anyway, the soldiers talk about\nit. The Parshendi grow carapaces.”\n“I’ve known parshmen,” Kaladin said. “There were a couple of them in\nmy hometown, serving the citylord. None of them grew armor.”\n“Well, these are a different kind of parshman,” Teft said with a scowl.\n“Bigger, stronger. They can jump chasms, for Kelek’s sake. And they grow\narmor. That’s just how it is.”\nThere was no disputing it, so they just moved on to gathering what\nthey could. Many Parshendi used heavy weapons—axes, hammers—and\nthose hadn’t been carried along with the bodies like many of the spears and\nbows Alethi soldiers had. But they did find several knives and one ornate\nsword, still in a sheath at the Parshendi’s side.\nThe skirts didn’t have pockets, but the corpses did have pouches tied to\ntheir waists. These just carried flint and tinder, whetstones, or other basic\nsupplies. So, they knelt to begin pulling the gemstones from the beards.\nThose gemstones had holes drilled through them to facilitate weaving, and\nStormlight infused them, though they didn’t glow as brightly as they would\nhave if they’d been properly cut.\nAs Rock pulled the gemstones out of the final Parshendi’s beard,\nKaladin held one of the knives up near Dunny’s torch, inspecting the\ndetailed carving. “Those look like glyphs,” he said, showing it to Teft.\n“I can’t read glyphs, boy.”\nOh, right, Kaladin thought. Well, if they were glyphs, they weren’t\nones he was familiar with. Of course, you could draw most glyphs in\ncomplex ways that made it hard to read them, unless you knew exactly what\nto look for. There was a figure at the center of the hilt, nicely carved. It was\na man in fine armor. Shardplate, certainly. A symbol was etched behind him,\nsurrounding him, spreading out from his back like wings.\nKaladin showed it to Rock, who had walked up to see what he found\nso fascinating. “The Parshendi out here are supposed to be barbarians,”\nKaladin said. “Without culture. Where did they get knives like these? I’d\nswear this is a picture of one of the Heralds. Jezerezeh or Nalan.”\nRock shrugged. Kaladin sighed and returned the knife to its sheath,\nthen dropped it into his sack. Then they rounded the curve back to the"

        "text": "Rock shrugged. Kaladin sighed and returned the knife to its sheath,\nthen dropped it into his sack. Then they rounded the curve back to the\nothers. The crew had gathered up sacks full of armor, belts, boots, and\nspheres. Each took up a spear to carry back to the ladder, holding them like\nwalking sticks. They’d left one for Kaladin, but he tossed it to Rock. He\ndidn’t trust himself to hold one of them again, worried he’d be tempted to\nfall into another kata.\nThe walk back was uneventful, though with the darkening sky, the men\nbegan jumping at every sound. Kaladin engaged Rock, Teft, and Dunny in\nconversation again. He was able to get Drehy and Torfin to talk a little as\nwell.\nThey safely reached the first chasm, much to the relief of his men.\nKaladin sent the others up the ladder first, waiting to go up last. Rock\nwaited with him, and as Dunny finally started up—leaving Rock and\nKaladin alone—the tall Horneater put a hand on Kaladin’s shoulder,\nspeaking in a soft voice.\n“You do good work here,” Rock said. “I am thinking that in a few\nweeks, these men will be yours.”\nKaladin shook his head. “We’re bridgemen, Rock. We don’t have a\nfew weeks. If I take that long winning them over, half of us will be dead.”\nRock frowned. “Is not a happy thought.”\n“That’s why we have to win over the other men now.”\n“But how?”\nKaladin looked up at the dangling ladder, shaking as the men climbed\nup. Only four could go at a time, lest they overload it. “Meet me after we’re\nsearched. We’re going to the camp market.”\n“Very well,” Rock said, swinging onto the ladder as Earless Jaks\nreached the top. “What will be our purpose in this thing?”\n“We’re going to try out my secret weapon.”\nRock laughed as Kaladin held the ladder steady for him. “And what\nweapon is this?”\nKaladin smiled. “Actually, it’s you.”\nTwo hours later, at Salas’s first violet light, Rock and Kaladin walked back\ninto the lumberyard. It was just past sunset, and many of the bridgemen\nwould soon be going to sleep.\nNot much time, Kaladin thought, gesturing for Rock to carry his\nburden to a place near the front of Bridge Four’s barrack. The large\nHorneater set his burden down next to Teft and Dunny, who had done as\nKaladin had ordered, building a small ring of stones and setting up some\nstumps of wood from the lumberyard scrap pile. That wood was free for\nanyone to take. Even bridgemen were allowed; some liked to take chunks to\nwhittle.\nKaladin got out a sphere for light. The thing Rock had been carrying\nwas an old iron cauldron. Even though it was secondhand, it had cost\nKaladin a fair chunk of the knobweed sap money. The Horneater began to\nunpack supplies from inside the cauldron as Kaladin arranged some wood\nscraps inside the ring of stones.\n“Dunny, water, if you please,” Kaladin said, getting out his flint.\nDunny ran off to fetch a bucket from one of the rain barrels. Rock finished"

Rock finished\nemptying the cauldron, laying out small packages that had cost another\nsubstantial portion of Kaladin’s spheres. He had only a handful of\nclearchips left.\nAs they worked, Hobber limped out of the barrack. He was mending\nquickly, though the other two wounded that Kaladin had treated were still in\nbad shape.\n“What are you up to, Kaladin?” Hobber asked just as Kaladin got a\nflame started.\nKaladin smiled, standing. “Have a seat.”\nHobber did just that. He hadn’t lost the near-devotion he’d shown\nKaladin for saving his life. If anything, his loyalty had grown stronger.\nDunny returned with a bucket of water, which he poured into the\ncauldron. Then he and Teft ran off to get more. Kaladin built up the flames\nand Rock began to hum to himself as he diced tubers and unwrapped some\nseasonings. In under a half hour, they had a roaring flame and a simmering\npot of stew.\nTeft sat down on one of the stumps, warming his hands. “This is your\nsecret weapon?”\nKaladin sat down next to the older man. “Have you known many\nsoldiers in your life, Teft?”\n“A few.”\n“You ever known any who could turn down a warm fire and some stew\nat the end of a hard day?”\n“Well, no. But bridgemen ain’t soldiers.”\nThat was true. Kaladin turned to the barrack doorway. Rock and\nDunny started up a song together and Teft began to clap along. Some of the\nmen from other bridge crews were up late, and they gave Kaladin and the\nothers nothing more than scowls.\nFigures shifted inside the barrack, shadows moving. The door was\nopen, and the scents of Rock’s stew grew strong. Inviting.\nCome on, Kaladin thought. Remember why we live. Remember\nwarmth, remember good food. Remember friends, and song, and evenings\nspent around the hearth.\nYou aren’t dead yet. Storm you! If you don’t come out…\nIt all suddenly seemed so contrived to Kaladin. The singing was\nforced, the stew an act of desperation. It was all just an attempt to briefly\ndistract from the pathetic life he had been forced into.\nA figure moved in the doorway. Skar—short, square-bearded, and\nkeen-eyed—stepped out into the firelight. Kaladin smiled at him. A forced\nsmile. Sometimes that was all one could offer. Let it be enough, he prayed,\nstanding up, dipping a wooden bowl into Rock’s stew.\nKaladin held the bowl toward Skar. Steam curled from the surface of\nthe brownish liquid. “Will you join us?” Kaladin asked. “Please.”\nSkar looked at him, then back down at the stew. He laughed, taking the\nstew. “I’d join the Nightwatcher herself around a fire if there was stew\ninvolved!”\n“Be careful,” Teft said. “That’s Horneater stew. Might be snail shells\nor crab claws floating in it.”"

Might be snail shells\nor crab claws floating in it.”\n“There is not!” Rock barked. “Is unfortunate that you have unrefined\nlowlander tastes, but I prepare the food such as I am ordered by our dear\nbridgeleader.”\nKaladin smiled, letting out a deep breath as Skar sat down. Others\ntrailed out after him, taking bowls, sitting. Some stared into the fire, not\nsaying much, but others began to laugh and sing. At one point, Gaz walked\npast, eyeing them with his single eye, as if trying to decide if they were\nbreaking any camp regulations. They weren’t. Kaladin had checked.\nKaladin dipped out a bowl of stew and held it toward Gaz. The bridge\nsergeant snorted in derision and stalked away.\nCan’t expect too many miracles in one night, Kaladin thought with a\nsigh, settling back down and trying the stew. It was quite good. He smiled,\njoining in the next verse of Dunny’s song.\nThe next morning, when Kaladin called for the bridgemen to rise, three-\nquarters of them piled out of the barrack—everyone but the loudest\ncomplainers: Moash, Sigzil, Narm, and a couple of others. The ones who\ncame to his call looked surprisingly refreshed, despite the long evening\nspent singing and eating. When he ordered them to join him in practice\ncarrying the bridge, almost all of those who had risen joined him.\nNot everyone, but enough.\nHe had a feeling that Moash and the others would give in before too\nlong. They’d eaten his stew. Nobody had turned that down. And now that he\nhad so many, the others would feel foolish not joining in. Bridge Four was\nhis.\nNow he had to keep them alive long enough for that to mean\nsomething.\nFor I have never been dedicated to a more important purpose, and the\nvery pillars of the sky will shake with the results of our war here. I ask\nagain. Support me. Do not stand aside and let disaster consume more\nlives. I’ve never begged you for something before, old friend. I do so\nnow.\nAdolin was frightened.\nHe stood beside his father on the staging ground. Dalinar looked…\nweathered. Creases running back from his eyes, furrows in his skin. Black\nhair going white like bleached rock along the sides. How could a man\nstanding in full Shardplate—a man who yet retained a warrior’s frame\ndespite his age—look fragile?\nIn front of them, two chulls followed their handler, stepping up onto\nthe bridge. The wooden span linked two piles of cut stones, a mock chasm\nonly a few feet deep. The chulls’ whiplike antennae twitched, mandibles\nclacking, fist-size black eyes glancing about. They pulled a massive siege\nbridge, rolling on creaking wooden wheels.\n“That’s much wider than the bridges Sadeas uses,” Dalinar said to\nTeleb, who stood beside them.\n“It’s necessary to accommodate the siege bridge, Brightlord.”\nDalinar nodded absently. Adolin suspected that he was the only one\nwho could see that his father was distressed. Dalinar maintained his usual\nconfident front, his head high, his voice firm when he spoke."

Dalinar maintained his usual\nconfident front, his head high, his voice firm when he spoke.\nYet, those eyes. They were too red, too strained. And when Adolin’s\nfather felt strained, he grew cold and businesslike. When he spoke to Teleb,\nhis tone was too controlled.\nDalinar Kholin was suddenly a man laboring beneath great weight.\nAnd Adolin had helped put him there.\nThe chulls advanced. Their boulderlike shells were painted blue and\nyellow, the colors and pattern indicating the island of their Reshi handlers.\nThe bridge beneath them groaned ominously as the larger siege bridge\nrolled onto it. All around the staging area, soldiers turned to look. Even the\nworkmen cutting a latrine into the stony ground on the eastern side stopped\nto watch.\nThe groans from the bridge grew louder. Then they became sharp\ncracks. The handlers halted the chulls, glancing toward Teleb.\n“It’s not going to hold, is it?” Adolin asked.\nTeleb sighed. “Storm it, I was hoping…Bah, we made the smaller\nbridge too thin when we widened it. But if we make it thicker, it will get too\nheavy to carry.” He glanced at Dalinar. “I apologize for wasting your time,\nBrightlord. You are correct; this is akin to the ten fools.”\n“Adolin, what do you think?” Dalinar asked.\nAdolin frowned. “Well…I think perhaps we should keep working with\nit. This is only the first attempt, Teleb. Perhaps there’s still a way. Design\nthe siege bridges to be narrower, maybe?”\n“That could be very costly, Brightlord,” Teleb said.\n“If it helps us win one extra gemheart, the effort would be paid for\nseveral times over.”\n“Yes,” Teleb said, nodding. “I will speak with Lady Kalana. Perhaps\nshe can devise a new design.”\n“Good,” Dalinar said. He stared at the bridge for an extended moment.\nThen, oddly, he turned to look toward the other side of the staging area,\nwhere the workers had been cutting the latrine ditch.\n“Father?” Adolin asked.\n“Why do you suppose,” Dalinar said, “there are no Shardplate-like\nsuits for workmen?”\n“What?”\n“Shardplate gives awesome strength, but we rarely use it for anything\nother than war and slaughter. Why did the Radiants fashion only weapons?\nWhy didn’t they make productive tools for use by ordinary men?”\n“I don’t know,” Adolin said. “Perhaps because war was the most\nimportant thing around.”\n“Perhaps,” Dalinar said, voice growing softer. “And perhaps that’s a\nfinal condemnation of them and their ideals. For all of their lofty claims,\nthey never gave their Plate or its secrets to the common people.”\n“I…I don’t understand why that’s important, Father.”\nDalinar shook himself slightly. “We should get on with our\ninspections. Where’s Ladent?”\n“Here, Brightlord.” A short man stepped up to Dalinar. Bald and\nbearded, the ardent wore thick, blue-grey layered robes from which his\nhands barely extended.

They’d chosen to wear their\nShardplate for this day’s inspections. That wasn’t uncommon; many\nShardbearers found any excuse they could to wear Plate. Plus, it was good\nfor the men to see their highprince and his heir in their strength.\nThey drew attention as they left the staging area and entered the\nwarcamp proper. Like Adolin, Dalinar went about unhelmed, though the\ngorget of his armor was tall and thick, rising like a metal collar up to his\nchin. He nodded to soldiers who saluted.\n“Adolin,” Dalinar said. “In combat, do you feel the Thrill?”\nAdolin started. He knew immediately what his father meant, but he\nwas shocked to hear the words. This wasn’t often discussed. “I…Well, of\ncourse. Who doesn’t?”\nDalinar didn’t reply. He had been so reserved lately. Was that pain in\nhis eyes? The way he was before, Adolin thought, deluded but confident.\nThat was actually better.\nDalinar said nothing more, and the two of them continued through the\ncamp. Six years had let the soldiers settle in thoroughly. Barracks were\npainted with company and squad symbols, and the space between them was\noutfitted with firepits, stools, and canvas-shaded dining areas. Adolin’s\nfather had forbidden none of this, though he had set guidelines to\ndiscourage sloppiness.\nDalinar had also approved most requests for families to be brought to\nthe Shattered Plains. The officers already had their wives, of course—a\ngood lighteyes officer was really a team, the man to command and fight, the\nwoman to read, write, engineer, and manage camp. Adolin smiled, thinking\nof Malasha. Would she prove to be the one for him? She’d been a little cold\nto him lately. Of course, there was Danlan. He’d only just met her, but he\nwas intrigued.\nRegardless, Dalinar had also approved requests by darkeyed common\nsoldiers to bring their families. He even paid half of the cost. When Adolin\nhad asked why, Dalinar had replied that he didn’t feel right forbidding them.\nThe warcamps were never attacked anymore, so there was no danger.\nAdolin suspected his father felt that since he was living in a luxurious near-\npalace, his men might as well have the comfort of their families.\nAnd so it was that children played and ran through the camp. Women\nhung wash and painted glyphwards as men sharpened spears and polished\nbreastplates. Barrack interiors had been partitioned to create rooms.\n“I think you were right,” Adolin said as they walked, trying to draw his\nfather out of his contemplations. “To let so many bring their families here, I\nmean.”\n“Yes, but how many will leave when this is over?”\n“Does it matter?”\n“I’m not certain. The Shattered Plains are now a de facto Alethi"

How will this place appear in a hundred years? Will those rings of\nbarracks become neighborhoods? The outer shops become markets? The\nhills to the west become fields for planting?” He shook his head. “The\ngemhearts will always be here, it seems. And so long as they are, there will\nbe people here as well.”\n“That’s a good thing, isn’t it? So long as those people are Alethi.”\nAdolin chuckled.\n“Perhaps. And what will happen to the value of gemstones if we\ncontinue to capture gemhearts at the rate we have?”\n“I…” That was a good question.\n“What happens, I wonder, when the scarcest, yet most desirable,\nsubstance in the land suddenly becomes commonplace? There’s much going\non here, son. Much we haven’t considered. The gemhearts, the Parshendi,\nthe death of Gavilar. You will have to be ready to consider these things.”\n“Me?” Adolin said. “What does that mean?”\nDalinar didn’t answer, instead nodding as the commander of the Fifth\nBattalion hastened up to them and saluted. Adolin sighed and saluted back.\nThe Twenty-first and Twenty-second Companies were doing close order\ndrill here—an essential exercise whose true value few outside the military\never appreciated. The Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Companies were\ndoing extended order—or combat—drill, practicing the formations and\nmovements used on the battlefield.\nFighting on the Shattered Plains was very different from regular\nwarfare, as the Alethi had learned from some embarrassing early losses. The\nParshendi were squat, muscular, and had that strange, skin-grown armor of\ntheirs. It didn’t cover as fully as plate, but it was far more efficient than\nwhat most foot soldiers had. Each Parshendi was essentially an extremely\nmobile heavy infantryman.\nThe Parshendi always attacked in pairs, eschewing a regular line of\nbattle. That should have made it easy for a disciplined line to defeat them.\nBut each pair of Parshendi had such momentum—and was so well armored\n—that they could break right through a shield wall. Alternatively, their\njumping prowess could suddenly deposit entire ranks of Parshendi behind\nAlethi lines.\nBeyond all that, there was that distinctive way they moved as a group\nin combat. They maneuvered with an inexplicable coordination. What had\nseemed at first to be mere barbarian savagery turned out to disguise\nsomething more subtle and dangerous.\nThey’d found only two reliable ways to defeat the Parshendi. The first\nwas to use a Shardblade. Effective, but of limited application. The Kholin\narmy had only two Blades, and while Shards were incredibly powerful, they\nneeded proper support. An isolated, outnumbered Shardbearer could be\ntripped and toppled by his adversaries. In fact, the one time Adolin had seen\na full Shardbearer fall to a regular soldier, it had happened because he had\nbeen swarmed by spearmen who broke his breastplate. Then a lighteyed\narcher had slain him from fifty paces, winning the Shards for himself. Not\nexactly a heroic end."

Not\nexactly a heroic end.\nThe other reliable way to fight Parshendi depended on quick-moving\nformations. Flexibility mixed with discipline: flexibility to respond to the\nuncanny way Parshendi fought, discipline to maintain lines and make up for\nindividual Parshendi strength.\nHavrom, Fifth Battalionlord, waited for Adolin and Dalinar with his\ncompanylords in a line. They saluted, right fists to right shoulders, knuckles\noutward.\nDalinar nodded to them. “Have my orders been seen to, Brightlord\nHavrom?”\n“Yes, Highprince.” Havrom was built like a tower, and wore a beard\nwith long sides after the Horneater fashion, chin clean-shaven. He had\nrelatives among the Peakfolk. “The men you wanted are waiting in the\naudience tent.”\n“What’s this?” Adolin asked.\n“I’ll show you in a moment,” Dalinar said. “First, review the troops.”\nAdolin frowned, but the soldiers were waiting. One company at a time,\nHavrom had the men fall in. Adolin walked before them, inspecting their\nlines and uniforms. They were neat and orderly, though Adolin knew that\nsome of the soldiers in their army grumbled at the level of polish required\nof them. He happened to agree with them on that point.\nAt the end of the inspection, he questioned a few random men, asked\ntheir rank and if they had any specific concerns. None had any. Were they\nsatisfied or just intimidated?\nWhen he was done, Adolin returned to his father.\n“You did that well,” Dalinar said.\n“All I did was walk down a line.”\n“Yes, but the presentation was good. The men know you care for their\nneeds, and they respect you.” He nodded, as if to himself. “You’ve learned\nwell.”\n“I think you’re reading too much into a simple inspection, Father.”\nDalinar nodded to Havrom, and the battalionlord led the two of them\nto an audience tent near the side of the practice field. Adolin, puzzled,\nglanced at his father.\n“I had Havrom gather the soldiers that Sadeas spoke to the other day,”\nDalinar said. “The ones he interviewed while we were on our way to the\nplateau assault.”\n“Ah,” Adolin said. “We’ll want to know what he asked them.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. He gestured for Adolin to enter before him, and\nthey walked in—tailed by a few of Dalinar’s ardents. Inside, a group of ten\nsoldiers waited on benches. They rose and saluted.\n“At ease,” Dalinar said, clasping plated hands behind his back.\n“Adolin?” Dalinar nodded toward the men, indicating that Adolin should\ntake the lead in the questioning.\nAdolin stifled a sigh. Again? “Men, we need to know what Sadeas\nasked you and how you responded.”\n“Don’t worry, Brightlord,” said one of the men, speaking with a rural\nnorthern Alethi accent. “We didn’t tell him nothing.”\nThe others nodded vigorously.\n“He’s an eel, and we know it,” another added."

Having a group of soldiers who could care for horses was useful,\nas it kept civilians from plateau assaults.\n“He asked around,” said one of the men. “Or, well, his people did.\nFound out we were in charge of the king’s horse during the chasmfiend\nhunt.”\n“But we didn’t say nothing,” the first soldier repeated. “Nothing to get\nyou into trouble, sir. We’re not going to give that ee—er, that highprince,\nBrightlord sir, the rope to hang you, sir.”\nAdolin closed his eyes. If they had acted this way around Sadeas, it\nwould have been more incriminating than the cut girth itself. He couldn’t\nfault their loyalty, but they acted as if they assumed Dalinar had done\nsomething wrong, and needed to defend him.\nHe opened his eyes. “I spoke to some of you before, I recall. But let\nme ask again. Did any of you see a cut strap on the king’s saddle?”\nThe men looked at each other, shaking heads. “No, Brightlord,” one of\nthe men replied. “If we’d seen it, we’d have changed it, right we would.”\n“But, Brightlord,” one of the men added, “there was a lot of confusion\nthat day, and a lot of people. Wasn’t a right regular plateau assault or\nnothing like that. And, well, to be honest, sir, who’d have thought that we’d\nneed to protect the king’s saddle, of all things under the Halls?”\nDalinar nodded to Adolin, and they stepped out of the tent. “Well?”\n“They probably didn’t do much to help our cause,” Adolin said with a\ngrimace. “Despite their ardor. Or, rather, because of it.”\n“Agreed, unfortunately.” Dalinar let out a sigh. He waved to Tadet; the\nshort ardent was standing to the side of the tent. “Interview them\nseparately,” Dalinar told him softly. “See if you can tease specifics from\nthem. Try to find out the exact words Sadeas used, and what their exact\nresponses were.”\n“Yes, Brightlord.”\n“Come, Adolin,” Dalinar said. “We’ve still got a few inspections to\ndo.”\n“Father,” Adolin said, taking Dalinar’s arm. Their armor clinked softly.\nDalinar turned to him, frowning, and Adolin made a quick gesture\ntoward the Cobalt Guard. A request for space to speak. The guards moved\nefficiently and quickly, clearing a private space around the two men.\n“What is this about, Father?” Adolin demanded softly.\n“What? We’re doing inspections and seeing to camp business.”\n“And in each case, you shove me out into the lead,” Adolin said."

What’s going on\ninside that head of yours?”\n“I thought you had a distinct problem with the things going on inside\nmy head.”\nAdolin winced. “Father, I—”\n“No, it’s all right, Adolin. I’m just trying to make a difficult decision. It\nhelps me to move about while I do it.” Dalinar grimaced. “Another man\nmight find a place to sit and brood, but that never seems to help me. I’ve got\ntoo much to do.”\n“What is it you’re trying to decide?” Adolin asked. “Perhaps I can\nhelp.”\n“You already have. I—” Dalinar cut off, frowning. A small force of\nsoldiers was walking up to the Fifth Battalion’s practice yards. They were\nescorting a man in red and brown. Those were Thanadal’s colors.\n“Don’t you have a meeting with him this evening?” Adolin asked.\n“Yes,” Dalinar said.\nNiter—head of the Cobalt Guard—ran to intercept the newcomers. He\ncould be overly suspicious at times, but that wasn’t a terrible trait for a\nbodyguard to have. He returned to Dalinar and Adolin shortly. Tanfaced,\nNiter bore a black beard, cut short. He was a lighteyes of very low rank, and\nhad been with the guard for years. “He says that Highprince Thanadal will\nbe unable to meet with you today as planned.”\nDalinar’s expression grew dark. “I will speak to the runner myself.”\nReluctantly, Niter waved the spindly fellow forward. He approached\nand dropped to one knee before Dalinar. “Brightlord.”\nThis time, Dalinar didn’t ask for Adolin to take the lead. “Deliver your\nmessage.”\n“Brightlord Thanadal regrets that he is unable to attend you this day.”\n“And did he offer another time to meet?”\n“He regrets to say that he has grown too busy. But he would be happy\nto speak with you at the king’s feast one evening.”\nIn public, Adolin thought, where half the men nearby will be\neavesdropping while the other half—likely including Thanadal himself—\nwill probably be drunk.\n“I see,” Dalinar said. “And did he give any indication of when he’d no\nlonger be so busy?”\n“Brightlord,” the messenger said, growing uncomfortable. “He said\nthat if you pressed, I should explain that he has spoken with several of the\nother highprinces, and feels he knows the nature of your inquiry. He said to\ntell you he does not wish to form an alliance, nor does he have any intention\nof going on a joint plateau assault with you.”\nDalinar’s expression grew darker. He dismissed the messenger with a\nwave, then turned to Adolin. The Cobalt Guard still kept a space open\naround them so they could talk.\n“Thanadal was the last of them,” Dalinar said.

Hatham with exceeding politeness,\nBethab by letting his wife give the explanation, Thanadal with hostile\ncivility. “All of them but Sadeas, at least.”\n“I doubt it would be wise to approach him with this, Father.”\n“You’re probably right.” Dalinar’s voice was cold. He was angry.\nFurious, even. “They’re sending me a message. They’ve never liked the\ninfluence I have over the king, and they’re eager to see me fall. They don’t\nwant to do something I ask them to, just in case it might help me regain my\nfooting.”\n“Father, I’m sorry.”\n“Perhaps it’s for the best. The important point is that I have failed. I\ncan’t get them to work together. Elhokar was right.” He looked to Adolin. “I\nwould like you to continue inspections for me, son. There’s something I\nwant to do.”\n“What?”\n“Just some work I see needs to be done.”\nAdolin wanted to object, but he couldn’t think of the words to say.\nFinally, he sighed and gave a nod. “You’ll tell me what this is about,\nthough?”\n“Soon,” Dalinar promised. “Very soon.”\nDalinar watched his son leave, striding purposefully away. He would make\na good highprince. Dalinar’s decision was a simple one.\nWas it time to step aside, and let his son take his place?\nIf he took this step, Dalinar would be expected to stay out of politics,\nretiring to his lands and leaving Adolin to rule. It was a painful decision to\ncontemplate, and he had to be careful not to make it hastily. But if he really\nwas going mad, as everyone in the camp seemed to believe, then he had to\nstep down. And soon, before his condition progressed to the point that he no\nlonger had the presence of mind to let go.\nA monarch is control, he thought, remembering a passage from The\nWay of Kings. He provides stability. It is his service and his trade good. If\nhe cannot control himself, then how can he control the lives of men? What\nmerchant worth his Stormlight won’t partake of the very fruit he sells?\nOdd, that those quotes still came to him, even as he was wondering if\nthey had—in part—driven him to madness. “Niter,” he said. “Fetch my\nwarhammer. Have it waiting for me at the staging field.”\nDalinar wanted to be moving, working, as he thought. His guards\nhastened to keep up as he strode down the pathway between the barracks of\nBattalions Six and Seven. Niter sent several men to fetch the weapon. His\nvoice sounded strangely excited, as if he thought Dalinar was going to do\nsomething impressive.\nDalinar doubted he would think it so. He eventually strode out onto the\nstaging field, cape fluttering behind him, plated boots clanking against\nthe stones.

Two men together could barely lift it.\nDalinar grabbed the hammer with one gauntleted hand, swinging it up\nto rest on his shoulder. He ignored the soldiers performing exercises on the\nfield, walking to where the group of dirty workers chipped at the latrine\nditch. They looked up at him, horrified to see the highprince himself\nlooming over them in full Shardplate.\n“Who’s in charge here?” Dalinar asked.\nA scruffy civilian in brown trousers raised a nervous hand. “Brightlord,\nhow may we serve you?”\n“By relaxing for a little while,” Dalinar said. “Out with you.”\nThe worried workers scrambled out. Lighteyed officers gathered\nbehind, confused by Dalinar’s actions.\nDalinar gripped the haft of his warhammer in a gauntleted hand; the\nmetal shaft was wrapped tightly with leather. Taking a deep breath, he\nleaped down into the half-finished ditch, lifted the hammer, then swung,\nslamming the weapon down against the rock.\nA powerful crack rang across the practice field, and a wave of shock\nran up Dalinar’s arms. The Shardplate absorbed most of the recoil, and he\nleft a large crack in the stones. He hefted and swung again, this time\nbreaking free a large section of rock. Though it would have been difficult\nfor two or three regular men to lift, Dalinar grabbed it with one hand and\ntossed it aside. It clattered across the stones.\nWhere were the Shards for regular men? Why hadn’t the ancients, who\nwere so wise, created anything to help them? As Dalinar continued to work,\nbeats of his hammer throwing chips and dust into the air, he easily did the\nwork of twenty men. Shardplate could be used for so many things to ease\nthe lives of workers and darkeyes across Roshar.\nIt felt good to be working. To be doing something useful. Lately, he\nfelt as if his efforts had been akin to running about in circles. The work\nhelped him think.\nHe was losing his thirst for battle. That worried him, as the Thrill—the\nenjoyment and longing for war—was part of what drove the Alethi as a\npeople. The grandest of masculine arts was to become a great warrior, and\nthe most important Calling was to fight. The Almighty himself depended on\nthe Alethi to train themselves in honorable battle so that when they died,\nthey could join the Heralds’ army and win back the Tranquiline Halls.\nAnd yet, thinking about killing was starting to sicken him. It had\ngrown worse since that last bridge assault. What would happen next time he\nwent into battle? He could not lead this way. That was a major reason that\nabdicating in favor of Adolin looked right.\nHe continued to swing. Again and again, beating against the stones.\nSoldiers gathered above and—despite his orders—the workers did not leave\nto relax. They watched, dumbfounded, as a Shardbearer did their work.\nOccasionally, he summoned his Blade and used it to cut the rock, slicing out\nsections before returning to the hammer to break them apart."

They watched, dumbfounded, as a Shardbearer did their work.\nOccasionally, he summoned his Blade and used it to cut the rock, slicing out\nsections before returning to the hammer to break them apart.\nHe probably looked ridiculous. He couldn’t do the work of all of the\nlaborers in camp, and he had important tasks to fill his time. There was no\nreason for him to get down in a trench and toil. And yet it felt so good. So\nwonderful to pitch in directly with the needs of the camp. The results of\nwhat he did to protect Elhokar were often difficult to gauge; it was fulfilling\nto be able to do something where his progress was obvious.\nBut even in this, he was acting according to the ideals that had infected\nhim. The book spoke of a king carrying the burdens of his people. It said\nthat those who led were the lowest of men, for they were required to serve\neveryone. It all swirled around in him. The Codes, the teachings of the\nbook, the things the visions—or delusions—showed.\nNever fight other men except when forced to in war.\nBang!\nLet your actions defend you, not your words.\nBang!\nExpect honor from those you meet, and give them the chance to live\nup to it.\nBang!\nRule as you would be ruled.\nBang!\nHe stood waist-deep in what would eventually be a latrine, his ears\nfilled with the groans of breaking stone. He was coming to believe those\nideals. No, he’d already come to believe them. Now he was living them.\nWhat would the world be like if all men lived as the book proclaimed?\nSomeone had to start. Someone had to be the model. In this, he had a\nreason not to abdicate. Whether or not he was mad, the way he now did\nthings was better than the way Sadeas or the others did them. One needed\nonly look at the lives of his soldiers and his people to see that was true.\nBang!\nStone could not be changed without pounding. Was it the same with a\nman like him? Was that why everything was so hard for him suddenly? But\nwhy him? Dalinar wasn’t a philosopher or idealist. He was a soldier. And—\nif he admitted the truth—in earlier years, he’d been a tyrant and a\nwarmonger. Could twilight years spent pretending to follow the precepts of\nbetter men erase a lifetime of butchery?\nHe had begun to sweat. The swath he had cut through the ground was\nas wide as a man was tall, as deep as his chest, and some thirty yards long.\nThe longer he worked, the more people gathered to watch and whisper.\nShardplate was sacred. Was the highprince really digging a latrine with\nit? Had the stress affected him that profoundly? Frightened of highstorms.\nGrowing cowardly. Refusing to duel or defend himself from slurs. Afraid of\nfighting, wishing to give up the war.\nSuspected of trying to kill the king.\nEventually, Teleb decided that letting all the people stare down at\nDalinar wasn’t respectful, and he ordered the men back to their separate\nduties.

He cleared away the workers, taking Dalinar’s order to heart and\ncommanding them to sit in the shade and “converse in a lighthearted\nmanner.” From someone else, that command might have been said with a\nsmile, but Teleb was as literal as the rocks themselves.\nStill Dalinar worked. He knew where the latrine was supposed to end;\nhe’d approved the work order. A long, sloping trough was to be cut, then\ncovered with oiled and tarred boards to seal in the scent. A latrine house\nwould be set at the high end, and the contents could be Soulcast to smoke\nonce every few months.\nThe work felt even better once he was alone. One man, breaking rocks,\npounding beat after beat. Like the drums the Parshendi had played on that\nday so long past. Dalinar could feel those beats still, could hear them in his\nmind, shaking him.\nI’m sorry, brother.\nHe had spoken to the ardents about his visions. They felt that the\nvisions were most likely a product of an overtaxed mind.\nHe had no reason to believe the truth of anything the visions showed\nhim. In following them, he had done more than just ignore Sadeas’s\nmaneuvers; he’d depleted his resources precariously. His reputation was on\nthe brink of ruin. He was in danger of dragging down the entire Kholin\nhouse.\nAnd that was the most important point in favor of him abdicating. If he\ncontinued, his actions could very well lead to the deaths of Adolin, Renarin,\nand Elhokar. He would risk his own life for his ideals, but could he risk the\nlives of his sons?\nChips sprayed, bouncing off his Plate. He was beginning to feel worn\nand tired. The Plate didn’t do the work for him—it enhanced his strength,\nso each strike of the hammer was his own. His fingers were growing numb\nfrom the repeated vibration of the hammer’s haft. He was close to a\ndecision. His mind was calm, clear.\nHe swung the hammer again.\n“Wouldn’t the Blade be more efficient?” asked a dry, feminine voice.\nDalinar froze, the hammer’s head resting on broken stone. He turned to\nsee Navani standing beside the trough, wearing a gown of blue and soft red,\nher grey-sprinkled hair reflecting light from a sun that was unexpectedly\nclose to setting. She was attended by two young women—not her own\nwards, but ones she had “borrowed” from other lighteyed women in the\ncamp.\nNavani stood with her arms folded, the sunlight behind her like a halo.\nDalinar hesitantly raised an armored forearm to block the light. “Mathana?”\n“The rockwork,” Navani said, nodding to the trough. “Now, I wouldn’t\npresume to make judgments; hitting things is a masculine art. But are you\nnot in the possession of a sword that can cut through stone as easily as—I\nonce had it described to me—a highstorm blows over a Herdazian?”\nDalinar looked back at the rocks. Then he raised his hammer again and\nslammed it into the stones, making a satisfying crunch. “Shardblades are\ntoo good at cutting.”\n“Curious,” she said. “I’ll do my best to pretend there was sense in that."

Bang! Remarkable how much easier it was to\nhave a conversation with Navani while not looking directly at her. “I do use\nthe Blade to cut down the sides and middle. But I still have to break up the\nrocks. Have you ever tried to lift out a chunk of stone that has been sliced\nby a Shardblade?”\n“I can’t say that I have.”\n“It’s not easy.” Bang! “Blades make a very thin cut.

He’d completely forgotten that, at the feast\nwhen she’d first returned, he’d agreed to have Navani read for him today.\nHe hadn’t told his scribes of the appointment. He turned toward her,\nchagrined. He’d been angered because Thanadal had canceled their\nappointment, but at least he had thought to send a messenger.\nNavani stood with arms folded, safehand tucked away, sleek dress\nseeming to burn with sunlight. She bore a hint of a smile on her lips. By\nstanding her up, he’d put himself—by honor—in her power.\n“I’m truly sorry,” he said. “I’ve had some difficult things to consider\nlately, but that doesn’t excuse forgetting you.”\n“I know. I’ll ponder a way to let you make up for the lapse. But for\nnow, you should know that one of your spanreeds is flashing.”\n“What? Which one?”\n“Your scribes say it is the one bound to my daughter.”\nJasnah! It had been weeks since they’d last communicated; the\nmessages he’d sent her had prompted only the tersest of answers. When\nJasnah was deeply immersed in one of her projects, she often ignored all\nelse. If she was sending to him now, either she’d discovered something or\nshe was taking a break to renew her contacts.\nDalinar turned to look down the latrine.

He’d have a new weapon forged; that was not unusual for\nShardbearers.\n“Your pardon, Mathana,” Dalinar said, “but I fear I must beg your\nleave so soon after begging your forgiveness. I must receive this\ncommunication.”\nHe bowed to her and turned to hurry away.\n“Actually,” Navani said from behind, “I think I’ll beg something of\nyou. It has been months since I’ve spoken with my daughter. I’ll join you, if\nyou’ll permit it.”\nHe hesitated, but he couldn’t deny her so soon after giving her offense.\n“Of course.” He waited as Navani walked to her palanquin and settled\nherself. The bearers lifted it, and Dalinar struck out again, the bearers and\nNavani’s borrowed wards walking close.\n“You are a kind man, Dalinar Kholin,” Navani said, that same sly\nsmile on her lips as she sat back in the cushioned chair. “I’m afraid that I’m\ncompelled to find you fascinating.”\n“My sense of honor makes me easy to manipulate,” Dalinar said, eyes\nforward. Dealing with her was not something he needed right now. “I know\nit does. No need to toy with me, Navani.”\nShe laughed softly. “I’m not trying to take advantage of you, Dalinar, I\n—” She paused. “Well, perhaps I am taking advantage of you just a little.\nBut I’m not ‘toying’ with you. This last year in particular, you’ve begun to\nbe the person the others all claim that they are. Can’t you see how\nintriguing that makes you?”\n“I don’t do it to be intriguing.”\n“If you did, it wouldn’t work!” She leaned toward him. “Do you know\nwhy I picked Gavilar instead of you all those years ago?”\nBlast. Her comments—her presence—were like a goblet of darkwine\npoured into the middle of his crystal thoughts. The clarity he’d sought in\nhard labor was quickly vanishing. Did she have to be so forward? He didn’t\nanswer the question. Instead, he picked up his pace and hoped that she’d see\nhe didn’t want to discuss the topic.\nIt was no use. “I didn’t pick him because he would become king,\nDalinar. Though that’s what everyone says. I chose him because you\nfrightened me. That intensity of yours…it scared your brother too, you\nknow.”\nHe said nothing.\n“It’s still in there,” she said. “I can see it in your eyes. But you’ve\nwrapped armor around it, a glistening set of Shardplate to contain it. That is\npart of what I find fascinating.”\nHe stopped, looking at her. The palanquin bearers halted. “This would\nnot work, Navani,” he said softly.\n“Wouldn’t it?”\nHe shook his head. “I will not dishonor my brother’s memory.” He\nregarded her sternly, and she eventually nodded.\nWhen he continued walking, she said nothing, though she did eye him\nslyly from time to time. Eventually, they reached his personal complex,\nmarked by fluttering blue banners with the glyphpair khokh and linil,\nthe former drawn in the shape of a crown, the second forming a tower."

The cavernous interior was lit by\ninfused sapphires. Once they reached his sitting chamber, he was again\nstruck by just how lavish it had gotten over the months.\nThree of his clerks waited with their attending girls. All six stood up\nwhen he entered. Adolin was also there.\nDalinar frowned at the youth. “Shouldn’t you be seeing to the\ninspections?”\nAdolin started. “Father, I finished those hours ago.”\n“You did?” Stormfather! How long did I spend pounding on those\nstones?\n“Father,” Adolin said, stepping up to him. “Can we speak privately for\na moment?” As usual, Adolin’s black-peppered blond hair was an unruly\nmop. He’d changed from his Plate and bathed, and now he wore a\nfashionable—though battle-worthy—uniform with a long blue coat,\nbuttoned at the sides, and straight, stiff brown trousers beneath.\n“I’m not ready to discuss that as yet, son,” Dalinar said softly. “I need\na little more time.”\nAdolin studied him, eyes concerned. He will make a fine highprince,\nDalinar thought. He’s been reared to it in a way that I never was.\n“All right then,” Adolin said. “But there’s something else I want to ask\nyou.” He pointed toward one of the clerks, a woman with auburn hair and\nonly a few strands of black. She was lithe and long-necked, wearing a green\ndress, her hair arranged high on her head in a complex set of braids held\ntogether with four traditional steel hair-spikes.\n“This is Danlan Morakotha,” Adolin said softly to Dalinar. “She came\ninto camp yesterday to spend a few months with her father, Brightlord\nMorakotha. She has been calling on me recently, and I took the liberty of\noffering her a position among your clerks while she is here.”\nDalinar blinked. “What about…”\n“Malasha?” Adolin sighed. “Didn’t work out.”\n“And this one?” Dalinar asked, voice hushed, yet incredulous. “How\nlong did you say she’s been in camp? Since yesterday? And you’ve already\ngot her calling on you?”\nAdolin shrugged. “Well, I do have a reputation to maintain.”\nDalinar sighed, eyeing Navani, who stood close enough to hear. She\npretended—for propriety—that she wasn’t listening in. “You know, it is\ncustomary to eventually choose just one woman to court.” You’re going to\nneed a good wife, son. Perhaps very soon.\n“When I’m old and boring, perhaps,” Adolin said, smiling at the young\nwoman. She was pretty. But only in camp one day? Blood of my ancestors,\nDalinar thought.

Even if he couldn’t remember her face, he did\nremember how persistently he’d pursued her.\nSurely he’d loved her. All emotion regarding her was gone, wiped\nfrom his mind by forces he should never have tempted. Unfortunately, he\ndid remember how much he’d desired Navani, years before meeting the\nwoman who would become his wife.\nStop that, he told himself. Moments ago, he’d been on the brink of\ndeciding to abdicate his seat as highprince. It was no time to let Navani\ndistract him.\n“Brightness Danlan Morakotha,” he said to the young woman. “You\nare welcome among my clerks. I understand that I’ve received a\ncommunication?”\n“Indeed, Brightlord,” the woman said, curtsying. She nodded to the\nline of five spanreeds sitting on his bookshelf, set upright in pen holders.\nThe spanreeds looked like ordinary writing reeds, except that each had a\nsmall infused ruby affixed. The one on the far right pulsed slowly.\nLitima was there, and though she had seniority, she nodded for Danlan\nto fetch the spanreed. The young woman hurried to the bookshelf and\nmoved the still-blinking reed to the small writing desk beside the lectern.\nShe carefully clipped a piece of paper onto the writing board and put the ink\nvial into its hole, twisting it snugly into place and then pulling the stopper.\nLighteyed women were very proficient at working with just their freehand.\nShe sat down, looking up at him, seeming slightly nervous. Dalinar\ndidn’t trust her, of course—she could easily be a spy for one of the other\nhighprinces. Unfortunately, there weren’t any women in camp he trusted\ncompletely, not with Jasnah gone.\n“I am ready, Brightlord,” Danlan said. She had a breathy, husky voice.\nJust the type that attracted Adolin. He hoped she wasn’t as vapid as those he\nusually picked.\n“Proceed,” Dalinar said, waving Navani toward one of the room’s\nplush easy chairs. The other clerks sat back down on their bench.\nDanlan turned the spanreed’s gemstone one notch, indicating that the\nrequest had been acknowledged. Then she checked the levels on the sides of\nthe writing board—small vials of oil with bubbles at the center, which\nallowed her to make the board perfectly flat. Finally, she inked the reed and\nplaced it on the dot at the top left of the page. Holding it upright, she\ntwisted the gemstone setting one more time with her thumb. Then she\nremoved her hand.\nThe reed remained in place, tip against the paper, hovering as if held in\na phantom hand. Then it began to write, mimicking the exact movements\nJasnah made miles away, writing with a reed conjoined to this one.\nDalinar stood beside the writing table, armored arms folded. He could\nsee that his proximity made Danlan nervous, but he was too anxious to sit.\nJasnah had elegant handwriting, of course—Jasnah rarely did anything\nwithout taking the time to perfect it.

Faint\nwisps of reddish smoke floated up from the gemstone.\nThe pen stopped writing, freezing in place.\n“‘Uncle,’” Danlan read, “‘I presume that you are well.’”\n“Indeed,” Dalinar replied. “I am well cared for by those around me.”\nThe words were code indicating that he didn’t trust—or at least didn’t know\n—everyone listening. Jasnah would be careful not to send anything too\nsensitive.\nDanlan took the pen and twisted the gemstone, then wrote out the\nwords, sending them across the ocean to Jasnah. Was she still in Tukar?\nAfter Danlan finished writing, she returned it to the dot at the top left—the\nspot where the pens were both to be placed so Jasnah could continue the\nconversation—then turned the gemstone back to the previous setting.\n“‘As I expected, I have found my way to Kharbranth,’” Danlan read.\n“‘The secrets I seek are too obscure to be contained even in the Palanaeum,\nbut I find hints. Tantalizing fragments. Is Elhokar well?’”\nHints? Fragments? Of what? She had a penchant for drama, Jasnah\ndid, though she wasn’t as flamboyant about it as the king.\n“Your brother tried very hard to get himself killed by a chasmfiend a\nfew weeks back,” Dalinar replied. Adolin smiled at that, leaning with his\nshoulder against the bookcase. “But evidently the Heralds watch over him.\nHe is well, though your presence here is sorely missed. I’m certain he could\nuse your counsel. He is relying heavily on Brightness Lalai to act as clerk.”\nPerhaps that would make Jasnah return. There was little love lost\nbetween herself and Sadeas’s cousin, who was the king’s head scribe in the\nqueen’s absence.\nDanlan scratched away, writing the words. To the side, Navani cleared\nher throat.\n“Oh,” Dalinar said, “add this: Your mother is here in the warcamps\nagain.”\nA short time later, the pen wrote of its own volition. “‘Send my mother\nmy respect. Keep her at arm’s length, Uncle. She bites.’”\nFrom the side, Navani sniffed, and Dalinar realized he hadn’t signaled\nthat Navani was actually listening. He blushed as Danlan continued\nspeaking. “‘I cannot speak of my work via spanreed, but I’m growing\nincreasingly concerned. There is something here, hidden by the sheer\nnumber of accrued pages in the historical record.’”\nJasnah was a Veristitalian. She’d explained it to him once; they were\nan order of scholars who tried to find the truth in the past. They wished to\ncreate unbiased, factual accounts of what had happened in order to\nextrapolate what to do in the future. He wasn’t clear on why they thought\nthemselves different from regular historians.\n“Will you be returning?” Dalinar asked.\n“‘I cannot say,’” Danlan read after the reply came. “‘I do not dare stop\nmy research. But a time may soon come when I dare not stay away either.’”\nWhat? Dalinar thought."

Dalinar thought.\n“‘Regardless,’” Danlan continued, “‘I have some questions for you. I\nneed you to describe for me again what happened when you met that first\nParshendi patrol seven years ago.’”\nDalinar frowned. Despite the Plate’s augmentation, his digging had left\nhim feeling tired. But he didn’t dare sit on one of the room’s chairs while\nwearing his Plate. He took off one of his gauntlets, though, and ran his hand\nthrough his hair. He wasn’t fond of this topic, but part of him was glad of\nthe distraction. A reason to hold off on making a decision that would change\nhis life forever.\nDanlan looked at him, prepared to dictate his words. Why did Jasnah\nwant this story again? Hadn’t she written an account of these very events in\nher biography of her father?\nWell, she would eventually tell him why, and—if her past revelations\nwere any indication—her current project would be of great worth. He\nwished Elhokar had received a measure of his sister’s wisdom.\n“These are painful memories, Jasnah. I wish I’d never convinced your\nfather to go on that expedition. If we’d never discovered the Parshendi, then\nthey couldn’t have assassinated him. The first meeting happened when we\nwere exploring a forest that wasn’t on the maps. This was south of the\nShattered Plains, in a valley about two weeks’ march from the Drying Sea.”\nDuring Gavilar’s youth, only two things had thrilled him—conquest\nand hunting. When he hadn’t been seeking one, it had been the other.\nSuggesting the hunt had seemed rational at the time. Gavilar had been\nacting oddly, losing his thirst for battle. Men had started to say that he was\nweak. Dalinar had wanted to remind his brother of the good times in their\nyouth. Hence the hunt for a legendary chasmfiend.\n“Your father wasn’t with me when I ran across them,” Dalinar\ncontinued, thinking back. Camping on humid, forested hills. Interrogating\nNatan natives via translators. Looking for scat or broken trees. “I was\nleading scouts up a tributary of the Deathbend River while your father\nscouted downstream. We found the Parshendi camped on the other side. I\ndidn’t believe it at first. Parshmen. Camped, free and organized. And they\ncarried weapons. Not crude ones, either. Swords, spears with carved\nhafts…”\nHe trailed off. Gavilar hadn’t believed either, when Dalinar told him.\nThere was no such thing as a free parshman tribe. They were servants, and\nalways had been servants.\n“‘Did they have Shardblades then?’” Danlan said. Dalinar hadn’t\nrealized that Jasnah had made a response.\n“No.”\nA scratched reply eventually came. “‘But they have them now. When\ndid you first see a Parshendi Shardbearer?’”\n“After Gavilar’s death,” Dalinar said.\nHe made the connection. They’d always wondered why Gavilar had\nwanted a treaty with the Parshendi.

        "text": "“After Gavilar’s death,” Dalinar said.\nHe made the connection. They’d always wondered why Gavilar had\nwanted a treaty with the Parshendi. They wouldn’t have needed one just to\nharvest the greatshells on the Shattered Plains; the Parshendi hadn’t lived\non the Plains then.\nDalinar felt a chill. Could his brother have known that these Parshendi\nhad access to Shardblades? Had he made the treaty hoping to get out of\nthem where they’d found the weapons?\nIs it his death? Dalinar wondered. Is that the secret Jasnah’s looking\nfor? She’d never shown Elhokar’s dedication to vengeance, but she thought\ndifferently from her brother. Revenge wouldn’t drive her. But questions.\nYes, questions would.\n“‘One more thing, Uncle,’” Danlan read. “‘Then I can go back to\ndigging through this labyrinth of a library. At times, I feel like a cairn\nrobber, sifting through the bones of those long dead. Regardless. The\nParshendi, you once mentioned how quickly they seemed to learn our\nlanguage.’”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “In a matter of days, we were speaking and\ncommunicating quite well. Remarkable.” Who would have thought that\nparshmen, of all people, had the wit for such a marvel? Most he’d known\ndidn’t do much speaking at all.\n“‘What were the first things they spoke to you about?’” Danlan said.\n“‘The very first questions they asked? Can you remember?’”\nDalinar closed his eyes, remembering days with the Parshendi camped\njust across the river from them. Gavilar had become fascinated by them.\n“They wanted to see our maps.”\n“Did they mention the Voidbringers?”\nVoidbringers? “Not that I recall. Why?”\n“‘I’d rather not say right now. However, I want to show you\nsomething. Have your scribe get out a new sheet of paper.’”\nDanlan affixed a new page to the writing board. She put the pen to the\ncorner and let go. It rose and began to scratch back and forth in quick, bold\nstrokes. It was a drawing. Dalinar stood up and stepped closer, and Adolin\ncrowded near. Reed and ink wasn’t the best medium, and drawing across\nspans wasn’t precise. The pen leaked tiny globs of ink in places it wouldn’t\nhave on the other side, and though the inkwell was in the exact same place\n—allowing Jasnah to re-ink both her reed and Dalinar’s at the same time—\nhis reed sometimes ran out before the one on the other side.\nStill, the picture was marvelous. This isn’t Jasnah, Dalinar realized.\nWhoever was doing the drawing was far, far more talented than his niece.\nThe picture resolved into a depiction of a tall shadow looming over\nsome buildings. Hints of carapace and claws showed in the thin ink lines,\nand shadows were made by drawing finer lines close together.\nDanlan set it aside, getting out a third sheet of paper. Dalinar held the\ndrawing up, Adolin at his side. The nightmarish beast in the lines and\nshadows was faintly familiar. Like…\n“It’s a chasmfiend,” Adolin said, pointing. “It’s distorted—far more"

Like…\n“It’s a chasmfiend,” Adolin said, pointing. “It’s distorted—far more\nmenacing in the face and larger at the shoulders, and I don’t see its second\nset of foreclaws—but someone was obviously trying to draw one of them.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said, rubbing his chin.\n“‘This is a depiction from one of the books here,’” Danlan read. “‘My\nnew ward is quite skilled at drawing, and so I had her reproduce it for you.\nTell me. Does it remind you of anything?’”\nA new ward? Dalinar thought. It had been years since Jasnah had taken\none. She always said she didn’t have the time. “This picture’s of a\nchasmfiend,” Dalinar said.\nDanlan wrote the words. A moment later, the reply came. “‘The book\ndescribes this as a picture of a Voidbringer.’” Danlan frowned, cocking her\nhead. “‘The book is a copy of a text originally written in the years before\nthe Recreance. However, the illustrations are copied from another text, even\nolder. In fact, some think that picture was drawn only two or three\ngenerations after the Heralds departed.’”\nAdolin whistled softly. That would make it very old indeed. So far as\nDalinar understood, they had few pieces of art or writing dating from the\nshadowdays, The Way of Kings being one of the oldest, and the only\ncomplete text. And even it had survived only in translation; they had no\ncopies in the original tongue.\n“‘Before you jump to conclusions,’” Danlan read, “‘I’m not implying\nthat the Voidbringers were the same thing as chasmfiends. I believe that the\nancient artist didn’t know what a Voidbringer looked like, and so she drew\nthe most horrific thing she knew of.’”\nBut how did the original artist know what a chasmfiend looked like?\nDalinar thought. We only just discovered the Shattered Plains—\nBut of course. Though the Unclaimed Hills were now empty, they had\nonce been an inhabited kingdom. Someone in the past had known about\nchasmfiends, known them well enough to draw one and label it a\nVoidbringer.\n“‘I must go now,’” Jasnah said via Danlan. “‘Care for my brother in\nmy absence, Uncle.’”\n“Jasnah,” Dalinar sent, choosing his words very carefully. “Things are\ndifficult here. The storm begins to blow unchecked, and the building shakes\nand moans. You may soon hear news that shocks you. It would be very nice\nif you could return and lend your aid.”\nHe waited quietly for the reply, the spanreed scratching. “‘I should like\nto promise a date when I will come.’” Dalinar could almost hear Jasnah’s\ncalm, cool voice. “‘But I cannot estimate when my research will be\ncompleted.’”\n“This is very important, Jasnah,” Dalinar said. “Please reconsider.”\n“‘Be assured, Uncle, that I am coming. Eventually. I just can’t say\nwhen.’”\nDalinar sighed.\n“‘Note,’” Jasnah wrote, “‘that I am most eager to see a chasmfiend for\nmyself.’”"

One of these\nyears, you will have to admit that your favored niece and nephew have\ngrown up.’”\n“I’ll treat you as adults so long as you act the part,” Dalinar said.\n“Come speedily, and we’ll get you a dead chasmfiend. Take care.”\nThey waited to see if a further response came, but the gem stopped\nblinking, Jasnah’s transmission complete. Danlan put away the spanreed\nand the board, and Dalinar thanked the clerks for their aid. They withdrew;\nAdolin looked as if he wanted to linger, but Dalinar gestured for him to\nleave.\nDalinar looked down at the picture of the chasmfiend again,\nunsatisfied. What had he gained from the conversation? More vague hints?\nWhat could be so important about Jasnah’s research that she would ignore\nthreats to the kingdom?\nHe would have to compose a more forthright letter to her once he’d\nmade his announcement, explaining why he had decided to step down.\nPerhaps that would bring her back.\nAnd, in a moment of shock, Dalinar realized that he had made his\ndecision. Sometime between leaving the trench and now, he’d stopped\ntreating his abdication as an if and started thinking of it as a when. It was\nthe right decision. He felt sick about it, but certain. A man sometimes\nneeded to do things that were unpleasant.\nIt was the discussion with Jasnah, he realized. The talk of her father.\nHe was acting like Gavilar at the end. That had nearly undermined the\nkingdom. Well, he needed to stop himself before he got that far. Perhaps\nwhatever was happening to him was some kind of disease of the mind,\ninherited from their parents. It—\n“You are quite fond of Jasnah,” Navani said.\nDalinar started, turning away from the picture of the chasmfiend. He’d\nassumed she’d followed Adolin out. But she still stood there, looking at\nhim.\n“Why is it,” Navani said, “that you encourage her so strongly to\nreturn?”\nHe turned to face Navani, and realized that she’d sent her two youthful\nattendants out with the clerks. They were now alone.\n“Navani,” he said. “This is inappropriate.”\n“Bah. We’re family, and I have questions.”\nDalinar hesitated, then walked to the center of the room. Navani stood\nnear the door. Blessedly, her attendants had left open the door at the end of\nthe antechamber, and beyond it were two guards in the hall outside. It\nwasn’t an ideal situation, but so long as Dalinar could see the guards and\nthey him, his conversation with Navani was just barely, proper.\n“Dalinar?” Navani asked. “Are you going to answer me? Why is it you\ntrust my daughter so much when others almost universally revile her?”\n“I consider their disdain for her to be a recommendation,” he said.\n“She is a heretic.”"

He\nsuddenly felt very exhausted. “People will talk.”\n“Let them. We need to plan, Dalinar. You are the most important\nhighprince in—”\n“Navani,” he cut in. “I’m going to abdicate in favor of Adolin.”\nShe blinked in surprise.\n“I’m stepping down as soon as I can make the necessary arrangements.\nIt will be a few days at most.” Speaking the words felt odd, as if saying\nthem made his decision real.\nNavani looked pained. “Oh, Dalinar,” she whispered. “This is a terrible\nmistake.”\n“It is mine to make. And I must repeat my request. I have many things\nto think about, Navani, and I can’t deal with you right now.” He pointed at\nthe doorway.\nNavani rolled her eyes, but left as requested. She shut the door behind\nher.\nThat’s it, Dalinar thought, letting out a long exhalation. I’ve made the\ndecision.\nToo weary to remove his Plate unassisted, he sank down onto the floor,\nresting his head back against the wall. He would tell Adolin of his decision\nin the morning, then announce it at a feast within the week. From there, he\nwould return to Alethkar and his lands.\nIt was over.\nTHE END OF\nPart Two\nRysn hesitantly stepped down from the caravan’s lead wagon. Her feet fell\non soft, uneven ground that sank down a little beneath her.\nThat made her shiver, particularly since the too-thick grass didn’t\nmove away as it should. Rysn tapped her foot a few times. The grass didn’t\nso much as quiver.\n“It’s not going to move,” Vstim said. “Grass here doesn’t behave the\nway it does elsewhere. Surely you’ve heard that.” The older man sat\nbeneath the bright yellow canopy of the lead wagon. He rested one arm on\nthe side rail, holding a set of ledgers with the other hand. One of his long\nwhite eyebrows was tucked behind his ear and he let the other trail down\nbeside his face. He preferred stiffly starched robes—blue and red—and a\nflat-topped conical hat. It was classic Thaylen merchant’s clothing: several\ndecades out of date, yet still distinguished.\n“I’ve heard of the grass,” Rysn said to him. “But it’s just so odd.” She\nstepped again, walking in a circle around the lead wagon. Yes, she’d heard\nof the grass here in Shinovar, but she’d assumed that it would just be\nlethargic. That people said it didn’t disappear because it moved too slowly."

The\nblades were all crowded together, and you couldn’t see the ground. What a\nmess it was.\n“The ground is springy,” she said, rounding back to her original side of\nthe wagon. “Not just because of the grass.”\n“Hmm,” Vstim said, still working on his ledgers. “Yes. It’s called\nsoil.”\n“It makes me feel like I’m going to sink down to my knees. How can\nthe Shin stand living here?”\n“They’re an interesting people. Shouldn’t you be setting up the\ndevice?”\nRysn sighed, but walked to the rear of the wagon. The other wagons in\nthe caravan—six in all—were pulling up and forming a loose circle. She\ntook down the tailgate of the lead wagon and heaved, pulling out a wooden\ntripod nearly as tall as she was. She carried it over one shoulder, marching\nto the center of the grassy circle.\nShe was more fashionable than her babsk; she wore the most modern\nof clothing for a young woman her age: a deep blue patterned silk vest over\na light green long-sleeved shirt with stiff cuffs. Her ankle-length skirt—also\ngreen—was stiff and businesslike, utilitarian in cut but embroidered for\nfashion.\nShe wore a green glove on her left hand. Covering the safehand was a\nsilly tradition, just a result of Vorin cultural dominance. But it was best to\nkeep up appearances. Many of the more traditional Thaylen people—\nincluding, unfortunately, her babsk—still found it scandalous for a woman\nto go about with her safehand uncovered.\nShe set up the tripod. It had been five months since Vstim become her\nbabsk and she his apprentice. He’d been good to her. Not all babsk were; by\ntradition, he was more than just her master. He was her father, legally, until\nhe pronounced her ready to become a merchant on her own.\nShe did wish he wouldn’t spend so much time traveling to such odd\nplaces. He was known as a great merchant, and she’d assumed that great\nmerchants would be the ones visiting exotic cities and ports. Not ones who\ntraveled to empty meadows in backward countries.\nTripod set up, she returned to the wagon to fetch the fabrial. The\nwagon back formed an enclosure with thick sides and top to offer protection\nagainst highstorms—even the weaker ones in the West could be dangerous,\nat least until one got through the passes and into Shinovar.\nShe hurried back to the tripod with the fabrial’s box. She slid off the\nwooden top and removed the large heliodor inside. The pale yellow\ngemstone, at least two inches in diameter, was fixed inside a metal\nframework. It glowed gently, not as bright as one might expect of such a\nsizable gem.\nShe set it in the tripod, then spun a few of the dials underneath, setting"

It glowed gently, not as bright as one might expect of such a\nsizable gem.\nShe set it in the tripod, then spun a few of the dials underneath, setting\nthe fabrial to the people in the caravan. Then she pulled a stool from the\nwagon and sat down to watch. She’d been astonished at what Vstim had\npaid for the device—one of the new, recently invented types that would\ngive warning if people approached. Was it really so important?\nShe sat back, looking up at the gemstone, watching to see if it grew\nbrighter. The odd grass of the Shin lands waved in the wind, stubbornly\nrefusing to withdraw, even at the strongest of gusts. In the distance rose the\nwhite peaks of the Misted Mountains, sheltering Shinovar. Those mountains\ncaused the highstorms to break and fade, making Shinovar one of the only\nplaces in all of Roshar where highstorms did not reign.\nThe plain around her was dotted with strange, straight-trunked trees\nwith stiff, skeletal branches full of leaves that didn’t withdraw in the wind.\nThe entire landscape had an eerie feel to it, as if it were dead. Nothing\nmoved. With a start, Rysn realized she couldn’t see any spren. Not a one.\nNo windspren, no lifespren, nothing.\nIt was as if the entire land were slow of wit. Like a man who was born\nwithout all his brains, one who didn’t know when to protect himself, but\ninstead just stared at the wall drooling. She dug into the ground with a\nfinger, then brought it up to inspect the “soil,” as Vstim had called it. It was\ndirty stuff. Why, a strong gust could uproot this entire field of grass and\nblow it away. Good thing the highstorms couldn’t reach these lands.\nNear the wagons, the servants and guards unloaded crates and set up\ncamp. Suddenly, the heliodor began to pulse with a brighter yellow light.\n“Master!” she called, standing. “Someone’s nearby.”\nVstim—who had been going through crates—looked up sharply. He\nwaved to Kylrm, head of the guards, and his six men got out their bows.\n“There,” one said, pointing.\nIn the distance, a group of horsemen was approaching. They didn’t\nride very quickly, and they led several large animals—like thick, squat\nhorses—pulling wagons. The gemstone in the fabrial pulsed more brightly\nas the newcomers got closer.\n“Yes,” Vstim said, looking at the fabrial. “That is going to be very\nhandy. Good range on it.”\n“But we knew they were coming,” Rysn said, rising from her stool and\nwalking over to him.\n“This time,” he said. “But if it warns us of bandits in the dark, it’ll\nrepay its cost a dozen times over. Kylrm, lower your bows. You know how\nthey feel about those things.”\nThe guards did as they were told, and the group of Thaylens waited.\nRysn found herself tucking her eyebrows back nervously, though she didn’t\nknow why she bothered. The newcomers were just Shin. Of course, Vstim\ninsisted that she shouldn’t think of them as savages. He seemed to have\ngreat respect for them."

He seemed to have\ngreat respect for them.\nAs they approached, she was surprised by the variety in their\nappearance. Other Shin she’d seen had worn basic brown robes or other\nworker’s clothing. At the front of this group, however, was a man in what\nmust be Shin finery: a bright, multicolored cloak that completely enveloped\nhim, tied closed at the front. It trailed down on either side of his horse,\ndrooping almost to the ground. Only his head was exposed.\nFour men rode on horses around him, and they wore more subdued\nclothing. Still bright, just not as bright. They wore shirts, trousers, and\ncolorful capes.\nAt least three dozen other men walked alongside them, wearing brown\ntunics. More drove the three large wagons.\n“Wow,” Rysn said. “He brought a lot of servants.”\n“Servants?” Vstim said.\n“The fellows in brown.”\nHer babsk smiled. “Those are his guards, child.”\n“What? They look so dull.”\n“Shin are a curious folk,” he said. “Here, warriors are the lowliest of\nmen—kind of like slaves. Men trade and sell them between houses by way\nof little stones that signify ownership, and any man who picks up a weapon\nmust join them and be treated the same. The fellow in the fancy robe? He’s\na farmer.”\n“A landowner, you mean?”\n“No. As far as I can tell, he goes out every day—well, the days when\nhe’s not overseeing a negotiation like this—and works the fields. They treat\nall farmers like that, lavish them with attention and respect.”\nRysn gaped. “But most villages are filled with farmers!”\n“Indeed,” Vstim said. “Holy places, here. Foreigners aren’t allowed\nnear fields or farming villages.”\nHow strange, she thought. Perhaps living in this place has affected\ntheir minds.\nKylrm and his guards didn’t look terribly pleased at being so heavily\noutnumbered, but Vstim didn’t seem bothered. Once the Shin grew close,\nhe walked out from his wagons without a hint of trepidation. Rysn hurried\nafter him, her skirt brushing the grass below.\nBother, she thought. Another problem with its not retracting. If she had\nto buy a new hem because of this dull grass, it was going to make her very\ncross.\nVstim met up with the Shin, then bowed in a distinctive way, hands\ntoward the ground. “Tan balo ken tala,” he said. She didn’t know what it\nmeant.\nThe man in the cloak—the farmer—nodded respectfully, and one of\nthe other riders dismounted and walked forward. “Winds of Fortune guide\nyou, my friend.” He spoke Thaylen very well. “He who adds is happy for\nyour safe arrival.”\n“Thank you, Thresh-son-Esan,” Vstim said. “And my thanks to he who\nadds.”\n“What have you brought for us from your strange lands, friend?”\nThresh said. “More metal, I hope?”\nVstim waved and some of the guards brought over a heavy crate.

Pieces of\nscrap metal, mostly shaped like bits of shell, though some were formed like\npieces of wood. It looked to Rysn like garbage that had—for some\ninexplicable reason—been Soulcast into metal.\n“Ah,” Thresh said, squatting down to inspect the box. “Wonderful!”\n“Not a bit of it was mined,” Vstim said. “No rocks were broken or\nsmelted to get this metal, Thresh. It was Soulcast from shells, bark, or\nbranches. I have a document sealed by five separate Thaylen notaries\nattesting to it.”\n“You needn’t have done such a thing as this,” Thresh said. “You have\nonce earned our trust in this matter long ago.”\n“I’d rather be proper about it,” Vstim said. “A merchant who is\ncareless with contracts is one who finds himself with enemies instead of\nfriends.”\nThresh stood up, clapping three times. The men in brown with the\ndowncast eyes lowered the back of a wagon, revealing crates.\n“The others who visit us,” Thresh noted, walking to the wagon. “All\nthey seem to care about are horses. Everyone wishes to buy horses. But\nnever you, my friend. Why is that?”\n“Too hard to care for,” Vstim said, walking with Thresh. “And there’s\ntoo often a poor return on the investment, valuable as they are.”\n“But not with these?” Thresh said, picking up one of the light crates.\nThere was something alive inside.\n“Not at all,” Vstim said. “Chickens fetch a good price, and they’re\neasy to care for, assuming you have feed.”\n“We brought you plenty,” Thresh said. “I cannot believe you buy these\nfrom us. They are not worth nearly so much as you outsiders think. And you\ngive us metal for them! Metal that bears no stain of broken rock. A\nmiracle.”\nVstim shrugged. “Those scraps are practically worthless where I come\nfrom. They’re made by ardents practicing with Soulcasters. They can’t\nmake food, because if you get it wrong, it’s poisonous. So they turn garbage\ninto metal and throw it away.”\n“But it can be forged!”\n“Why forge the metal,” Vstim said, “when you can carve an object\nfrom wood in the precise shape you want, then Soulcast it?”\nThresh just shook his head, bemused. Rysn watched with her own\nshare of confusion. This was the craziest trade exchange she’d ever seen.\nNormally, Vstim argued and haggled like a crushkiller. But here, he freely\nrevealed that his wares were worthless!\nIn fact, as conversation proceeded, the two both took pains to explain\nhow worthless their goods were. Eventually, they came to an agreement—\nthough Rysn couldn’t grasp how—and shook hands on the deal. Some of\nThresh’s soldiers began to unload their boxes of chickens, cloth, and exotic\ndried meats. Others began carting away boxes of scrap metal.\n“You couldn’t trade me a soldier, could you?” Vstim asked as they\nwaited.\n“They cannot be sold to an outsider, I am afraid.”"

You forced me to take something in trade, though to confess,\nI had to throw your payment into a river. I could not take money for a\nTruthless.”\n“Well, I suppose I can’t take offense at that,” Vstim said, rubbing his\nchin. “But if you ever have another, let me know. Best servant I ever had. I\nstill regret that I traded him.”\n“I will remember, friend,” Thresh said. “But I do not think it likely we\nwill have another like him.” He seemed to grow distracted. “Indeed, I\nshould hope that we never do….”\nOnce the goods were exchanged, they shook hands again, then Vstim\nbowed to the farmer. Rysn tried to mimic what he did, and earned a smile\nfrom Thresh and several of his companions, who chattered in their\nwhispering Shin language.\nSuch a long, boring ride for such a short exchange. But Vstim was\nright; those chickens would be worth good spheres in the East.\n“What did you learn?” Vstim said to her as they walked back toward\nthe lead wagon.\n“That Shin are odd.”\n“No,” Vstim said, though he wasn’t stern. He never seemed to be stern.\n“They are simply different, child. Odd people are those who act erratically.\nThresh and his kind, they are anything but erratic. They may be a little too\nstable. The world is changing outside, but the Shin seem determined to\nremain the same. I’ve tried to offer them fabrials, but they find them\nworthless. Or unholy. Or too holy to use.”\n“Those are rather different things, master.”\n“Yes,” he said. “But with the Shin, it’s often hard to distinguish among\nthem. Regardless, what did you really learn?”\n“That they treat being humble like the Herdazians treat boasting,” she\nsaid. “You both went out of your way to show how worthless your wares\nwere. I found it strange, but I think it might just be how they haggle.”\nHe smiled widely. “And already you are wiser than half the men I’ve\nbrought here. Listen. Here is your lesson. Never try to cheat the Shin. Be\nforthright, tell them the truth, and—if anything—undervalue your goods.\nThey will love you for it. And they’ll pay you for it too.”\nShe nodded. They reached the wagon, and he got out a strange little\npot. “Here,” he said. “Use a knife and go cut out some of that grass. Be sure\nto cut down far and get plenty of the soil. The plants can’t live without it.”\n“Why am I doing this?” she asked, wrinkling her nose and taking the\npot."

I want\nyou to keep it with you until you stop thinking of it as odd.”\n“But why?”\n“Because it will make you a better merchant,” he said.\nShe frowned. Must he be so strange so much of the time? Perhaps that\nwas why he was one of the only Thaylens who could get a good deal out of\nthe Shin. He was as odd as they were.\nShe walked off to do as she was told. No use complaining. She did get\nout a rugged pair of gloves first, though, and roll up her sleeves. She was\nnot going to ruin a good dress for a pot of drooling, wall-staring, imbecile\ngrass. And that was that.\nAxies the Collector groaned, lying on his back, skull pounding with a\nheadache. He opened his eyes and looked down the length of his body. He\nwas naked.\nBlight it all, he thought.\nWell, best to check and see if he was hurt too badly. His toes pointed at\nthe sky. The nails were a deep blue color, not uncommon for an Aimian\nman like himself. He tried to wiggle them and, pleasingly, they actually\nmoved.\n“Well, that’s something,” he said, dropping his head back to the\nground. It made a squishing sound as it touched something soft, likely a bit\nof rotting garbage.\nYes, that was what it was. He could smell it now, pungent and rank. He\nfocused on his nose, sculpting his body so that he could no longer smell.\nAh, he thought. Much better.\nNow if he could only banish the pounding in his head. Really, did the\nsun have to be so garish overhead? He closed his eyes.\n“You’re still in my alley,” a gruff voice said from behind him. That\nvoice had awakened him in the first place.\n“I shall vacate it presently,” Axies promised.\n“You owe me rent. One night’s sleep.”\n“In an alleyway?”\n“Finest alleyway in Kasitor.”\n“Ah. Is that where I am, then? Excellent.”\nA few heartbeats of mental focus finally banished the headache. He\nopened his eyes, and this time found the sunlight quite pleasant. Brick walls\nrose toward the sky on either side of him, overgrown with a crusty red\nlichen. Small heaps of rotting tubers were scattered around him.\nNo. Not scattered. They looked to be arranged carefully. Odd, that.\nThey were likely the source of the scents he’d noticed earlier. Best to leave\nhis sense of smell inhibited.\nHe sat up, stretching, checking his muscles. All seemed to be in\nworking order, though he had quite a few bruises. He’d deal with those in a\nbit. “Now,” he said, turning, “you wouldn’t happen to have a spare pair of\npants, would you?”\nThe own er of the voice turned out to be a scraggly-bearded man\nsitting on a box at the end of the alleyway.

That wasn’t surprising, considering that he’d\nbeen beaten, robbed, and left for dead. Again.\nThe things I do in the name of scholarship, he thought with a sigh.\nHis memory was returning. Kasitor was a large Iriali city, second in\nsize only to Rall Elorim. He’d come here by design. He’d also gotten\nhimself drunk by design. Perhaps he should have picked his drinking\ncompanions more carefully.\n“I’m going to guess that you don’t have a spare pair of pants,” Axies\nsaid, standing and inspecting the tattoos on his arm. “And if you did, I’d\nsuggest that you wear them yourself. Is that a lavis sack you have on?”\n“You owe me rent,” the man grumbled. “And payment for destroying\nthe temple of the northern god.”\n“Odd,” Axies said, looking over his shoulder toward the alleyway’s\nopening. There was a busy street beyond. The good people of Kasitor would\nlikely not take well to his nudity. “I don’t recall destroying any temples.\nNormally I’m quite cognizant of that sort of thing.”\n“You took out half of Hapron Street,” the beggar said. “Number of\nhomes as well. I’ll let that slide.”\n“Mighty kind of you.”\n“They’ve been wicked lately.”\nAxies frowned, looking back at the beggar. He followed the man’s\ngaze, looking down at the ground. The heaps of rotting vegetables had been\nplaced in a very particular arrangement. Like a city.\n“Ah,” Axies said, moving his foot, which had been planted on a small\nsquare of vegetable.\n“That was a bakery,” the beggar said.\n“Terribly sorry.”\n“The family was away.”\n“That’s a relief.”\n“They were worshipping at the temple.”\n“The one I…”\n“Smashed with your head? Yes.”\n“I’m certain you’ll be kind to their souls.”\nThe beggar narrowed his eyes at him. “I’m still trying to decide how\nyou fit into things. Are you a Voidbringer or a Herald?”\n“Voidbringer, I’m afraid,” Axies said. “I mean, I did destroy a temple.”\nThe beggar’s eyes grew more suspicious.\n“Only the sacred cloth can banish me,” Axies continued. “And since\nyou don’t…I say, what is that you’re holding?”\nThe beggar looked down at his hand, which was touching one of the\nratty blankets draped over one of his equally ratty boxes. He perched atop\nthem, like…well, like a god looking down over his people.\nPoor fool, Axies thought. It was really time to be moving on. Wouldn’t\nwant to bring any bad luck down upon the addled fellow.\nThe beggar held up the blanket. Axies shied back, raising his hands.\nThat made the beggar smile a grin that could have used a few more teeth.\nHe hopped off his box, holding the blanket up wardingly. Axies shied away.\nThe beggar cackled and threw the blanket at him. Axies snatched it\nfrom the air and shook a fist at the beggar.

They were very particular about a lot of things. Of\ncourse, that could be said for most peoples—the only difference were the\nthings they were particular about.\nAxies the Collector drew his share of stares. Not because of his\nunconventional clothing—Iri was on the northwestern rim of Roshar, and\nits weather therefore tended to be much warmer than that of places like\nAlethkar or even Azir. A fair number of the golden-haired Iriali men went\nabout wearing only waist wraps, their skin painted various colors and\npatterns. Even Axies’s tattoos weren’t that noteworthy here.\nPerhaps he drew stares because of his blue nails and crystalline deep\nblue eyes. Aimians—even Siah Aimians—were rare. Or perhaps it was\nbecause he cast a shadow the wrong way. Toward light, instead of away\nfrom it. It was a small thing, and the shadows weren’t long, with the sun so\nhigh. But those who noticed muttered or jumped out of the way. Likely\nthey’d heard of his kind. It hadn’t been that long since the scouring of his\nhomeland. Just long ago enough for stories and legends to have crept into\nthe general knowledge of most peoples.\nPerhaps someone important would take exception to him and have him\nbrought before a local magistrate. Wouldn’t be the first time. He’d learned\nlong ago not to worry. When the Curse of Kind followed you, you learned\nto take what happened as it happened.\nHe began to whistle softly to himself, inspecting his tattoos and\nignoring those observant enough to gawk. I remember writing something\nsomewhere… he thought, looking over his wrist, then twisting his arm over\nand trying to see if there were any new tattoos on the back. Like all\nAimians, he could change the color and markings of his skin at will. That\nwas convenient, as when you were very regularly robbed of everything you\nowned, it was blighted difficult to keep a proper notebook. And so, he kept\nhis notes on his skin, at least until he could return to a safe location and\ntranscribe them.\nHopefully, he hadn’t gotten so drunk that he’d written his observations\nsomeplace inconvenient. He’d done that once, and reading the mess had\nrequired two mirrors and a very confused bathing attendant.\nAh, he thought, discovering a new entry near the inside of his left\nelbow. He read it awkwardly, shuffling down the incline.\nTest successful. Have noted spren who appear only when one is\nseverely intoxicated. Appear as small brown bubbles clinging to objects\nnearby.

Intoxicationspren? No, too unwieldy. Alespren? He felt a\nsurge of excitement. He’d been hunting this particular type of spren for\nyears. If they proved real, it would be quite a victory.\nWhy did they appear only in Iri? And why so infrequently? He’d\ngotten himself stupidly drunk a dozen times, and had only found them once.\nIf, indeed, he had ever really found them.\nSpren, however, could be very elusive. Sometimes, even the most\ncommon types—flamespren, for instance—would refuse to appear. That\nmade it particularly frustrating for a man who had made it his life’s work to\nobserve, catalogue, and study every single type of spren in Roshar.\nHe continued whistling as he made his way through the town to the\ndockside. Around him flowed large numbers of the golden-haired Iriali. The\nhair bred true, like black Alethi hair—the purer your blood was, the more\nlocks of gold you had. And it wasn’t merely blond, it was truly gold,\nlustrous in the sun.\nHe had a fondness for the Iriali. They weren’t nearly as prudish as the\nVorin peoples to the east, and were rarely inclined to bickering or fighting.\nThat made it easier to hunt spren. Of course, there were also spren you\ncould find only during war.\nA group of people had gathered at the docks. Ah, he thought, excellent.\nI’m not too late. Most were crowding onto a purpose-built viewing\nplatform. Axies found himself a place to stand, adjusted his holy blanket,\nand leaned back against the railing to wait.\nIt wasn’t long. At precisely seven forty-six in the morning—the locals\ncould use it to set their timepieces—an enormous, sea-blue spren surged\nfrom the waters of the bay. It was translucent, and though it appeared to\nthrow out waves as it rose, that was illusory. The actual surface of the bay\nwasn’t disturbed.\nIt takes the shape of a large jet of water, Axies thought, creating a\ntattoo along an open portion of his leg, scribing the words. The center is of\nthe deepest blue, like the ocean depths, though the outer edges are a lighter\nshade. Judging by the masts of the nearby ships, I’d say that the spren has\ngrown to a height of at least a hundred feet. One of the largest I’ve ever\nseen.\nThe column sprouted four long arms that came down around the bay,\nforming fingers and thumbs. They landed on golden pedestals that had been\nplaced there by the people of the city. The spren came at the same time\nevery day, without fail.\nThey called it by name, Cusicesh, the Protector. Some worshipped it as\na god. Most simply accepted it as part of the city. It was unique.

Different human faces appear on the end of its\nstumplike neck, one after another in blurred succession.\nThe display lasted a full ten minutes. Did any of the faces repeat? They\nchanged so quickly, he couldn’t tell. Some seemed male, others female.\nOnce the display was finished, Cusicesh retreated down into the bay,\nsending up phantom waves again.\nAxies felt drained, as if something had been leeched from him. That\nwas reported to be a common reaction. Was he imagining it because it was\nexpected? Or was it real?\nAs he considered, a street urchin scrambled past and grabbed his wrap,\nyanking it free and laughing to himself. He tossed it to some friends and\nthey scrambled away.\nAxies shook his head. “What a bother,” he said as people around him\nbegan to gasp and mutter. “There are guards nearby, I assume? Ah yes.

He was beginning to consider them\nmythological.\nThe guards towed him off toward the city dungeons, but he didn’t\nmind. Two new spren in as many days! At this rate, it might only take a few\nmore centuries to complete his research.\nGrand indeed. He resumed whistling to himself.\nSzeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, crouched on a high stone\nledge at the side of the gambling den. The ledge was meant for holding a\nlantern; both his legs and the shelf were hidden by his long, enveloping\ncloak, making him seem to be hanging from the wall.\nThere were few lights nearby. Makkek liked Szeth to remain cloaked\nin shadow. He wore a formfitting black costume beneath the cloak, the\nlower part of his face covered by a cloth mask; both were of Makkek’s\ndesign. The cloak was too big and the clothing too tight. It was a terrible\noutfit for an assassin, but Makkek demanded drama, and Szeth did as his\nmaster commanded. Always.\nPerhaps there was something useful to the drama. With only his eyes\nand bald head showing, he unnerved the people who passed by. Shin eyes,\ntoo round, slightly too large. The people here thought them similar to the\neyes of a child. Why did that disturb them so?\nNearby, a group of men in brown cloaks sat chatting and rubbing their\nthumbs and forefingers together. Wisps of smoke rose between their fingers,\naccompanied by a faint crackling sound. Rubbing firemoss was said to\nmake a man’s mind more receptive to thoughts and ideas. The one time\nSzeth had tried it, it had given him a headache and two blistered fingers."

The one time\nSzeth had tried it, it had given him a headache and two blistered fingers.\nBut once you grew the calluses, it could apparently be euphoric.\nThe circular den had a bar at the center, serving a wide variety of\ndrinks at a wider variety of prices. The barmaids were dressed in violet\nrobes that had plunging necklines and were open at the sides. Their\nsafehands were exposed, something that the Bavlanders—who were Vorin\nby descent—seemed to find extremely provocative. So odd. It was just a\nhand.\nAround the perimeter of the den, various games were in progress.\nNone of them were overt games of chance—no dice throws, no bets on card\nflips. There were games of breakneck, shallowcrab fights, and—oddly—\nguessing games. That was another oddity about Vorin peoples; they avoided\novertly guessing the future. A game like breakneck would have throws and\ntosses, but they wouldn’t bet on the outcome. Instead, they’d bet on the\nhand they held after the throws and the draws.\nIt seemed a meaningless distinction to Szeth, but it was deeply steeped\nin the culture. Even here, in one of the vilest pits in the city—where women\nwalked with their hands exposed and men spoke openly of crimes—nobody\nrisked offending the Heralds by seeking to know the future. Even predicting\nthe highstorms made many uncomfortable. And yet they thought nothing of\nwalking on stone or using Stormlight for everyday illumination. They\nignored the spirits of things that lived around them, and they ate whatever\nthey wanted on any day they wanted.\nStrange. So strange. And yet this was his life. Recently, Szeth had\nbegun to question some of the prohibitions he had once followed so strictly.\nHow could these Easterners not walk on stone? There was no soil in their\nlands. How could they get about without treading on stone?\nDangerous thoughts. His way of life was all that remained to him. If he\nquestioned Stone Shamanism, would he then question his nature as\nTruthless? Dangerous, dangerous. Though his murders and sins would\ndamn him, at least his soul would be given to the stones upon his death. He\nwould continue to exist. Punished, in agony, but not exiled to nothingness.\nBetter to exist in agony than to vanish entirely.\nMakkek himself strode the floor of the gambling den, a woman on\neach arm. His scrawny leanness was gone, his face having slowly gained a\njuicy plumpness, like a fruit ripening after the drowning’s waters. Also gone\nwere his ragged footpad’s garments, replaced with luxurious silks.\nMakkek’s companions—the ones with him when they’d killed Took—\nwere all dead, murdered by Szeth at Makkek’s orders. All to hide the secret\nof the Oathstone. Why were these Easterners always so ashamed of the way\nthey controlled Szeth? Was it because they feared another would steal the\nOathstone from them? Were they terrified that the weapon they employed so\ncallously would be turned against them?\nPerhaps he feared that if it were known how easily Szeth was\ncontrolled, it would spoil their reputation.

Szeth had overheard more than\none conversation centered around the mystery of Makkek’s terribly\neffective bodyguard. If a creature like Szeth served Makkek, then the\nmaster himself must be even more dangerous.\nMakkek passed the place where Szeth lurked, one of the women on his\narms laughing with tinkling sound. Makkek glanced at Szeth, then gestured\ncurtly. Szeth bowed his masked head in acknowledgment. He slid from his\nplace, dropping to the ground, oversized cloak fluttering.\nGames stilled. Men both drunken and sober turned to watch Szeth, and\nas he passed the three men with the firemoss, their fingers went limp. Most\nin the room knew what Szeth was about this night. A man had moved into\nBornwater and opened his own gambling den to challenge Makkek. Likely\nthis newcomer didn’t believe the reputation of Makkek’s phantom assassin.\nWell, he had reason to be skeptical. Szeth’s reputation was inaccurate.\nHe was far, far more dangerous than it suggested.\nHe ducked out of the gambling den, passing up the steps through the\ndarkened storefront and then out into the yard. He tossed the cloak and face\nmask into a wagon as he passed. The cloak would only make noise, and\nwhy cover his face? He was the only Shin in town. If someone saw his eyes,\nthey’d know who he was. He retained the tight black clothing; changing\nwould take too much time.\nBornwater was the largest town in the area; it hadn’t taken Makkek\nlong to outgrow Staplind. Now he was talking of moving up to Kneespike,\nthe city where the local landlord had his mansion. If that happened, Szeth\nwould spend months wading in blood as he systematically tracked down\nand killed each and every thief, cutthroat, and gambling master who refused\nMakkek’s rule.\nThat was months off. For now, there was Bornwater’s interloper, a man\nnamed Gavashaw. Szeth prowled through the streets, eschewing Stormlight\nor Shardblade, counting on his natural grace and care to keep him unseen.\nHe enjoyed his brief freedom. These moments—when he wasn’t trapped in\none of Makkek’s smoke-filled dens—were too few lately.\nSlipping between buildings—moving swiftly in the darkness, with the\nwet, cold air on his skin—he could almost think himself back in Shinovar.\nThe buildings around him were not of blasphemous stone, but earthen ones,\nbuilt with clay and soil. Those low sounds were not muffled cheers from\nwithin another of Makkek’s gambling dens, but the thunder and whinnies of\nwild horses on the plains.\nBut no. In Shinovar he’d never smelled refuse like that—pungency\ncompounded by weeks spent marinating. He was not home. There was no\nplace for him in the Valley of Truth.\nSzeth entered one of the richer sections of town, where buildings had\nmore space between homes. Bornwater was in a lait, protected by a\ntowering cliffside to the east. Gavashaw had arrogantly made his home in a\nlarge mansion on the eastern side of town.

The landlord had heard of Makkek and\nhis quick rise to prominence in the underground, and supporting a rival was\na good way to create an early check on Makkek’s power.\nThe citylord’s local mansion was three stories tall, with a stone wall\nsurrounding the compact, neatly gardened grounds. Szeth approached in a\nlow crouch. Here on the outskirts of town, the ground was spotted with\nbulbous rockbuds. As he passed, the plants rustled, pulling back their vines\nand lethargically closing their shells.\nHe reached the wall and pressed himself against it. It was the time\nbetween the first two moons, the darkest period of night. The hateful hour,\nhis people called it, for it was one of the only times when the gods did not\nwatch men. Soldiers walked the wall above, feet scraping the stones.\nGavashaw probably thought himself safe in this building, which was secure\nenough for a powerful lighteyes.\nSzeth breathed in, infusing himself with Stormlight from the spheres in\nhis pouch. He began to glow, luminescent vapors rising from his skin. In the\ndarkness, it was quite noticeable. These powers had never been intended for\nassassination; Surgebinders had fought during the light of day, battling the\nnight but not embracing it.\nThat was not Szeth’s place. He would simply have to take extra care\nnot to be seen.\nTen heartbeats after the passing of the guards, Szeth Lashed himself to\nthe wall. That direction became down for him, and he was able to run up the\nside of the stone fortification. As he reached the top, he leaped forward,\nthen briefly Lashed himself backward. He spun over the top of the wall in a\ntucked flip, then Lashed himself back to the wall again. He came down with\nfeet planted on the stones, facing the ground. He ran and Lashed himself\ndownward again, dropping the last few feet.\nThe grounds were laced with shalebark mounds, cultivated to form\nsmall terraces. Szeth ducked low, picking his way through the mazelike\ngarden. There were guards at the building’s doorways, watching by the light\nof spheres. How easy it would be to dash up, consume the Stormlight, and\nplunge the men into darkness before cutting them down.\nBut Makkek had not expressly commanded him to be so destructive.\nGavashaw was to be assassinated, but the method was up to Szeth. He\npicked one that would not require killing the guards. That was what he\nalways did, when given the chance. It was the only way to preserve what\nlittle humanity he had left.\nHe reached the western wall of the mansion and Lashed himself to it,\nthen ran up it onto the roof. It was long and flat, sloped gently eastward—an\nunnecessary feature in a lait, but Easterners saw the world by the light of\nthe highstorms. Szeth quickly crossed to the rear of the building, to where a\nsmall rock dome covered a lower portion of the mansion. He dropped down\nonto the dome, Stormlight streaming from his body. Translucent,\nluminescent, pristine. Like the ghost of a fire burning from him, consuming\nhis soul."

Like the ghost of a fire burning from him, consuming\nhis soul.\nHe summoned his Shardblade in the stillness and dark, then used it to\nslice a hole in the dome, angling his Blade so that the chunk of rock did not\nfall down inside. He reached down with his free hand and infused the stone\ncircle with Light, Lashing it toward the northwest section of the sky.\nLashing something to a distant point like that was possible, but imprecise. It\nwas like trying to shoot an arrow a great distance.\nHe stepped back as the stone circle lurched free and fell up into the air,\nstreaming Stormlight as it soared toward the splattered paint drops of stars\nabove. Szeth leapt into the hole, then immediately Lashed himself to the\nceiling. He twisted in the air, landing with his feet planted on the underside\nof the dome beside the lip of the hole he’d cut. From his perspective, he was\nnow standing at the bottom of a gigantic stone bowl, the hole cut in the very\nbottom, looking out on the stars beneath.\nHe walked up the side of the bowl, Lashing himself to the right. In\nseconds he was on the floor, reoriented so that the dome rose above him.\nDistantly, he heard a faint crashing: The chunk of stone, Stormlight\nexhausted, had fallen back to the ground. He had aimed it out of the town.\nHopefully, it had not caused any accidental deaths.\nThe guards would now be distracted, searching for the source of the\ndistant crash. Szeth breathed in deeply, draining his second pouch of\ngemstones. The light streaming from him became brighter, letting him see\nthe room around him.\nAs he’d suspected, it was empty. This was a rarely used feasting hall,\nwith cold firepits, tables, and benches. The air was still, silent, and musty.\nLike that of a tomb. Szeth hurried to the door, slid his Shardblade between\nit and the frame, and sliced through the deadbolt. He eased the door open.\nThe Stormlight rising from his body illuminated the dark hallway outside.\nEarly during his time with Makkek, Szeth had been careful not to use\nthe Shardblade. As his tasks had grown more difficult, however, he’d been\nforced to resort to it to avoid unnecessary killing. Now the rumors about\nhim were populated with tales of holes cut through stone and dead men with\nburned eyes.\nMakkek had begun to believe those rumors. He hadn’t yet demanded\nthat Szeth relinquish the Blade—if he did so, he would discover the second\nof Szeth’s two forbidden actions. He was required to carry the Blade until\nhis death, after which Shin Stone Shamans would recover it from\nwhomever had killed him.\nHe moved through the hallways. He wasn’t worried about Makkek\ntaking the Blade, but he was worried about how bold the thief lord was\ngrowing. The more successful Szeth was, the more audacious Makkek\nbecame. How long before he stopped using Szeth to kill minor rivals,\ninstead sending him to kill Shardbearers or powerful lighteyes? How long\nbefore someone made the connection?

A Shin assassin with a Shardblade,\ncapable of mysterious feats and extreme stealth? Could this be the now-\ninfamous Assassin in White? Makkek could draw the Alethi king and\nhighprinces away from their war on the Shattered Plains and bring them\ncrashing down upon Jah Keved. Thousands would die. Blood would fall\nlike the rain of a highstorm—thick, pervasive, destructive.\nHe continued down the hallway in a swift low run, Shardblade carried\nin a reverse grip, extending out behind him. Tonight, at least, he\nassassinated a man who deserved his fate. Were the hallways too quiet?\nSzeth hadn’t seen a soul since leaving the rooftop. Could Gavashaw have\nbeen foolish enough to place all of his guards outside, leaving his\nbedchamber undefended?\nAhead, the doors into the master’s rooms lay unwatched and dark at\nthe end of a short hallway. Suspicious.\nSzeth crept up to the doors, listening. Nothing. He hesitated, glancing\nto the side. A grand stairway led up to the second floor. He hustled over and\nused his Blade to shear free a wooden knob from the newel post. It was\nabout the size of a small melon. A few hacks with the Blade cut a cloak-\nsized section of drapery free from a window. Szeth hurried back to the\ndoors and infused the wooden sphere with Stormlight, giving it a Basic\nLashing that pointed it westward, directly ahead of him.\nHe cut through the latch between the doors and eased one open. The\nroom beyond was dark. Was Gavashaw gone for the evening? Where would\nhe go? This city was not safe for him yet.\nSzeth placed the wooden ball in the middle of the drape, then held it up\nand dropped it. It fell forward, toward the far wall. Wrapped in the fabric,\nthe ball looked vaguely like a person in a cloak running through the room in\na crouch.\nNo concealed guards struck at it. The decoy bounced off a latched\nwindow, then came to rest hanging against the wall. It continued to leak\nStormlight.\nThat light illuminated a small table with an object atop it. Szeth\nsquinted, trying to make out what it was. He edged forward, slinking into\nthe room, closer and closer to the table.\nYes. The object on the table was a head. One with Gavashaw’s\nfeatures. Shadows thrown by Stormlight gave the grisly face an even more\nhaunted cast. Someone had beaten Szeth to the assassination.\n“Szeth-son-Neturo,” a voice said.\nSzeth turned, spinning his Shardblade around and falling into a\ndefensive stance. A figure stood on the far side of the room, shrouded in the\ndarkness. “Who are you?” Szeth demanded, his Stormlight aura growing\nbrighter once he stopped holding his breath.\n“Are you satisfied with this, Szeth-son-Neturo?” the voice asked. It\nwas male and deep. What was that accent? The man wasn’t Veden. Alethi,\nperhaps? “Are you satisfied with trivial crimes? Killing over meaningless\nturf in backwater mining villages?”"

Killing over meaningless\nturf in backwater mining villages?”\nSzeth didn’t reply. He scanned the room, looking for motion in the\nother shadows. None seemed to be hiding anyone.\n“I’ve watched you,” the voice said. “You’ve been sent to intimidate\nshopkeepers. You’ve killed footpads so unimportant even the authorities\nignore them. You’ve been shown off to impress whores, as if they were high\nlighteyed ladies. What a waste.”\n“I do as my master demands.”\n“You are squandered,” the voice said. “You are not meant for petty\nextortions and murders. Using you like this, it’s like hitching a Ryshadium\nstallion to a run-down market wagon. It’s like using a Shardblade to slice\nvegetables, or like using the finest parchment as kindling for a washwater\nfire. It is a crime. You are a work of art, Szeth-son-Neturo, a god. And each\nday Makkek throws dung at you.”\n“Who are you?” Szeth repeated.\n“An admirer of the arts.”\n“Do not call me by my father’s name,” Szeth said. “He should not be\nsullied by association with me.”\nThe sphere on the wall finally ran out of Stormlight, dropping to the\nfloor, the drapery muffling its fall. “Very well,” the figure said. “But do you\nnot rebel against this frivolous use of your skills? Were you not meant for\ngreatness?”\n“There is no greatness in killing,” Szeth said. “You speak like a kukori.\nGreat men create food and clothing. He who adds is to be revered. I am he\nwho takes away. At least in the killing of men such as these I can pretend to\nbe doing a service.”\n“This from the man who nearly toppled one of the greatest kingdoms\nin Roshar?”\n“This from the man who committed one of the most heinous slaughters\nin Roshar,” Szeth corrected.\nThe figure snorted. “What you did was a mere breeze compared to the\nstorm of slaughter Shardbearers wreak on a battlefield each day. And those\nare breezes compared to the tempests you are capable of.”\nSzeth began to walk away.\n“Where are you going?” the figure asked.\n“Gavashaw is dead. I must return to my master.”\nSomething hit the floor. Szeth spun, Shardblade down. The figure had\ndropped something round and heavy. It rolled across the floor toward Szeth.\nAnother head. It came to rest on its side. Szeth froze as he made out\nthe features. The pudgy cheeks were stained with blood, the dead eyes wide\nwith shock: Makkek.\n“How?” Szeth demanded.\n“We took him seconds after you left the gambling den.”\n“We?”\n“Servants of your new master.”\n“My Oathstone?”\nThe figure opened his hand, revealing a gemstone suspended in his\npalm by a chain wrapped around his fingers. Sitting beside it, now\nilluminated, was Szeth’s Oathstone. The figure’s face was dark; he wore a\nmask.\nSzeth dismissed his Shardblade and went down on one knee. “What\nare your orders?”"

The figure’s face was dark; he wore a\nmask.\nSzeth dismissed his Shardblade and went down on one knee. “What\nare your orders?”\n“There is a list on the table,” the figure said, closing his hand and\nhiding the Oathstone. “It details our master’s wishes.”\nSzeth rose and walked over. Beside the head, which rested on a plate to\ncontain the blood, was a sheet of paper. He took it, and his Stormlight\nilluminated some two dozen names written in the warrior’s script of his\nhomeland. Some had a note beside them with instructions on how they were\nto be killed.\nGlories within, Szeth thought. “These are some of the most powerful\npeople in the world! Six highprinces? A Selay gerontarch? The king of Jah\nKeved?”\n“It is time you stopped wasting your talent,” the figure said, walking to\nthe far wall, resting his hand upon it.\n“This will cause chaos,” Szeth whispered. “Infighting. War. Confusion\nand pain such as the world has rarely known.”\nThe chained gemstone on the man’s palm flashed. The wall vanished,\nturned to smoke. A Soulcaster.\nThe dark figure glanced at Szeth. “Indeed. Our master directs that you\nare to use tactics similar to those you employed so well in Alethkar years\nago. When you are done, you will receive further instructions.”\nHe then exited through the opening, leaving Szeth horrified. This was\nhis nightmare. To be in the hands of those who understood his capabilities\nand who had the ambition to use them properly. He stood for a time, silent,\nlong past when his Stormlight ran out.\nThen, reverently, he folded the list. He was surprised that his hands\nwere so steady. He should be trembling.\nFor soon the world itself would shake.\n“The ones of ash and fire, who killed like a swarm, relentless before\nthe Heralds.”\n—Noted in Masly, page 337. Corroborated by Coldwin and Hasavah.\nIt sounds like you’re getting into Jasnah’s good graces quickly, the spanreed\nwrote out. How long before you can make the switch?\nShallan grimaced, turning the gemstone on the reed. I don’t know, she\nwrote back. Jasnah keeps a close watch on the Soulcaster, as you’d expect.\nShe wears it all day. At night, she locks it away in her safe and wears the\nkey around her neck.\nShe turned the gemstone, then waited for a reply. She was in her\nchamber, a small, stone-carved room inside Jasnah’s quarters. Her\naccommodations were austere: A small bed, a nightstand, and the writing\ntable were her only furniture. Her clothing remained in the trunk she had\nbrought. No rug adorned the floor, and there were no windows, as the rooms\nwere in the Kharbranthian Conclave, which was underground.\nThat does make it troubling, the reed wrote. Eylita—Nan Balat’s\nbetrothed—was the one doing the writing, but all three of Shallan’s\nsurviving brothers would be in the room back in Jah Keved, contributing to\nthe conversation."

Nan Balat wants me to point\nout that we are very sorry to make you do this. It must be difficult for you to\nbe away so long.\nDifficult? Shallan picked up the spanreed and hesitated.\nYes, it was difficult. Difficult not to fall in love with the freedom,\ndifficult not to get too absorbed in her studies. It had been only two months\nsince she’d convinced Jasnah to take her as a ward, but already she felt half\nas timid and twice as confident.\nThe most difficult thing of all was knowing that it would soon end.\nComing to study in Kharbranth was, without doubt, the most wonderful\nthing that had ever happened to her.\nI will manage, she wrote. You are the ones living the difficult life,\nmaintaining our family’s interests at home. How are you doing?\nIt took time for them to reply. Poorly, Eylita finally sent. Your father’s\ndebts are coming due, and Wikim can barely keep the creditors distracted.\nThe highprince ails, and everyone wants to know where our house stands\non the question of succession. The last of the quarries is running out. If it\nbecomes known that we no longer have resources, it will go badly for us.\nShallan grimaced. How long do I have?\nA few more months, at best, Nan Balat sent back via his betrothed. It\ndepends on how long the highprince lasts and whether or not anyone\nrealizes why Asha Jushu is selling our possessions. Jushu was the youngest\nof the brothers, just older than Shallan. His old gambling habit was actually\ncoming in handy. For years, he’d been stealing things from their father and\nselling them to cover his losses. He pretended he was still doing that, but he\nbrought the money back to help. He was a good man, despite his habit. And,\nall things considered, he really couldn’t be blamed for much of what he’d\ndone. None of them could.\nWikim thinks that he can keep everyone at bay for a while longer. But\nwe are getting desperate. The sooner you return with the Soulcaster, the\nbetter.\nShallan hesitated, then wrote, Are we certain this is the best way?\nPerhaps we should simply ask Jasnah for help.\nYou think she would respond to that? they wrote back. She would help\nan unknown and disliked Veden house? She would keep our secrets?\nProbably not. Though Shallan was increasingly certain that Jasnah’s\nreputation was exaggerated, the woman did have a ruthless side to her. She\nwould not leave her important studies to go help Shallan’s family.\nShe reached for the reed to reply, but it started scribbling again.\nShallan, it said. This is Nan Balat; I have sent the others away. It is only\nEylita and me writing you now. There is something you need to know. Luesh\nis dead."

He was one of the few\npeople she and her brothers had determined they could trust.\nWhat happened? she wrote after switching to a new sheet of paper.\nHe died in his sleep, and there’s no reason to suspect he was killed. But\nShallan, a few weeks after his passing, some men visited here claiming to be\nfriends of our father. In private with me, they implied they knew of Father’s\nSoulcaster and suggested strongly that I was to return it to them.\nShallan frowned. She still carried her father’s broken Soulcaster in the\nsafepouch of her sleeve. Return it? she wrote.\nWe never did figure out where Father got it, Nan Balat sent. Shallan,\nhe was involved in something. Those maps, the things Luesh said, and now\nthis. We continue to pretend that Father is alive, and occasionally he gets\nletters from other lighteyes that speak of vague “plans.” I think he was\ngoing to make a play to become highprince. And he was supported by some\nvery powerful forces.\nThese men who came, they were dangerous, Shallan. The type of men\nyou do not cross. And they want their Soulcaster back. Whoever they are, I\nsuspect they gave it to Father so he could create wealth and make a bid for\nthe succession. They know he’s dead.\nI believe that if we don’t return a working Soulcaster to them, we could\nall be in serious danger. You need to bring Jasnah’s fabrial to us. We’ll\nquickly use it to create new quarries of valuable stone, and then we can\ngive it up to these men. Shallan, you must succeed. I was hesitant about this\nplan when you suggested it, but other avenues are quickly vanishing.\nShallan felt a chill. She read over the paragraphs a few times, then\nwrote, If Luesh is dead, then we don’t know how to use the Soulcaster. That\nis problematic.\nI know, Nan Balat sent. See if you can figure that out. This is\ndangerous, Shallan. I know it is. I’m sorry.\nShe took a deep breath. It must be done, she wrote.\nHere, Nan Balat sent. I wanted to show you something. Have you ever\nseen this symbol? The sketch that followed was crude. Eylita wasn’t much\nof an artist. Fortunately, it was a simple picture—three diamond shapes in a\ncurious pattern.\nI’ve never seen it, Shallan wrote. Why?\nLuesh wore a pendant with this symbol on it, Nan Balat sent. We found\nit on his body. And one of the men who came searching for the Soulcaster\nhad the same pattern tattooed on his hand, just below his thumb.\nCurious, Shallan wrote. So Luesh…\nYes, Nan Balat sent.

Luesh was involved in this,\nperhaps as liaison between Father and the people backing him. I tried to\nsuggest that they could back me instead, but the men just laughed. They did\nnot stay long or give a specific time by which the Soulcaster must be\nreturned. I doubt they’d be satisfied to receive a broken one.\nShallan pursed her lips. Balat, have you thought that we might be\nrisking a war? If it becomes known that we’ve stolen an Alethi Soulcaster…\nNo, there wouldn’t be a war, Nan Balat wrote back. King Hanavanar\nwould just turn us over to the Alethi. They’d execute us for the theft.\nWonderfully comforting, Balat, she wrote. Thank you so much.\nYou’re welcome. We’re going to have to hope that Jasnah doesn’t\nrealize that you took the Soulcaster. It seems likely she’ll assume that hers\nbroke for some reason.\nShallan sighed. Perhaps, she wrote.\nTake care, Nan Balat sent her.\nYou too.\nAnd that was it. She set the spanreed aside, then read over the entire\nconversation, memorizing it. Then she crumpled up the sheets and walked\ninto the sitting room of Jasnah’s quarters. She wasn’t there—Jasnah rarely\nbroke from her studies—so Shallan burned the conversation in the hearth.\nShe stood for a long moment, watching the fire. She was worried. Nan\nBalat was capable, but they all bore scars from the lives they’d led. Eylita\nwas the only scribe they could trust, and she…well, she was incredibly nice\nbut not very clever.\nWith a sigh, Shallan left the room to return to her studies. Not only\nwould they help get her mind off her troubles, but Jasnah would grow testy\nif she dallied too long.\nFive hours later, Shallan wondered why it was she’d been so eager.\nShe did enjoy her chances at scholarship. But recently, Jasnah had set\nher to study the history of the Alethi monarchy. It wasn’t the most\ninteresting subject around. Her boredom was compounded by her being\nforced to read a number of books that expressed opinions she found\nridiculous.\nShe sat in Jasnah’s alcove at the Veil. The enormous wall of lights,\nalcoves, and mysterious researchers no longer awed her. The place was\nbecoming comfortable and familiar. She was alone at the moment.\nShallan rubbed her eyes with her freehand, then slid her book closed.\n“I,” she muttered, “am really coming to hate the Alethi monarchy.”\n“Is that so?” a calm voice said from behind. Jasnah walked past,\nwearing a sleek violet dress, followed by a parshman porter with a stack of\nbooks. “I’ll try not to take it personally.”\nShallan winced, then blushed furiously. “I didn’t mean individually,\nBrightness Jasnah. I meant categorically.”\nJasnah lithely took her seat in the alcove. She raised an eyebrow at\nShallan, then gestured for the parshman to set down his burden."

        "text": "Brightness Jasnah. I meant categorically.”\nJasnah lithely took her seat in the alcove. She raised an eyebrow at\nShallan, then gestured for the parshman to set down his burden.\nShallan still found Jasnah an enigma. At times, she seemed a stern\nscholar annoyed by Shallan’s interruptions. At other times, there seemed to\nbe a hint of wry humor hiding behind the stern facade. Either way, Shallan\nwas finding that she felt remarkably comfortable around the woman. Jasnah\nencouraged her to speak her mind, something Shallan had taken to gladly.\n“I assume from your outburst that this topic is wearing on you,” Jasnah\nsaid, sorting through her volumes as the parshman withdrew. “You\nexpressed interest in being a scholar. Well, you must learn that this is\nscholarship.”\n“Reading argument after argument from people who refuse to see any\nother point of view?”\n“They’re confident.”\n“I’m not an expert on confidence, Brightness,” Shallan said, holding\nup a book and inspecting it critically. “But I’d like to think that I could\nrecognize it if it were before me. I don’t think that’s the right word for\nbooks like this one from Mederia. They feel more arrogant than confident to\nme.” She sighed, setting the book aside. “To be honest, ‘arrogant’ doesn’t\nfeel like quite the right word. It’s not specific enough.”\n“And what would be the right word, then?”\n“I don’t know. ‘Errorgant,’ perhaps.”\nJasnah raised a skeptical eyebrow.\n“It means to be twice as certain as someone who is merely arrogant,”\nShallan said, “while possessing only one-tenth the requisite facts.”\nHer words drew a hint of a smile from Jasnah. “What you are reacting\nagainst is known as the Assuredness Movement, Shallan. This errorgance is\na literary device. The scholars are intentionally overstating their case.”\n“The Assuredness Movement?” Shallan asked, holding up one of her\nbooks. “I guess I could get behind that.”\n“Oh?”\n“Yes. Much easier to stab it in the back from that position.”\nThat got only an eyebrow raise. So, more seriously, Shallan continued.\n“I suppose I can understand the device, Brightness, but these books you’ve\ngiven me on King Gavilar’s death are more and more irrational in defending\ntheir points. What began as a rhetorical conceit seems to have descended\ninto name-calling and squabbling.”\n“They are trying to provoke discussion. Would you rather that the\nscholars hide from the truth, like so many? You would have men prefer\nignorance?”\n“When reading these books, scholarship and ignorance feel much alike\nto me,” Shallan said. “Ignorance may reside in a man hiding from\nintelligence, but scholarship can seem ignorance hidden behind\nintelligence.”\n“And what of intelligence without ignorance? Finding truth while not\ndismissing the possibility of being wrong?”\n“A mythological treasure, Brightness, much like the Dawnshards or the\nHonorblades. Certainly worth seeking, but only with great caution.”\n“Caution?” Jasnah said, frowning.\n“It would make you famous, but actually finding it would destroy us\nall.

Proof that one can be both intelligent and accept the intelligence of\nthose who disagree with you? Why, I should think it would undermine the\nscholarly world in its entirety.”\nJasnah sniffed. “You go too far, child. If you took half the energy you\ndevote to being witty and channeled it into your work, I daresay you could\nbe one of the greatest scholars of our age.”\n“I’m sorry, Brightness,” Shallan said. “I…well, I’m confused.\nConsidering the gaps in my education, I assumed you would have me\nstudying things deeper in the past than a few years ago.”\nJasnah opened one of her books. “I have found that youths like you\nhave a relative lack of appreciation for the distant past. Therefore, I selected\nan area of study that is both more recent and sensational, to ease you into\ntrue scholarship. Is the murder of a king not of interest to you?”\n“Yes, Brightness,” Shallan said. “We children love things that are\nshiny and loud.”\n“You have quite the mouth on you at times.”\n“At times? You mean it’s not there at others? I’ll have to…” Shallan\ntrailed off, then bit her lip, realizing she’d gone too far. “Sorry.”\n“Never apologize for being clever, Shallan. It sets a bad precedent.\nHowever, one must apply one’s wit with care. You often seem to say the\nfirst passably clever thing that enters your mind.”\n“I know,” Shallan said. “It’s long been a foible of mine, Brightness.\nOne my nurses and tutors tried very hard to discourage.”\n“Likely through strict punishments.”\n“Yes. Making me sit in the corner holding books over my head was the\npreferred method.”\n“Which, in turn,” Jasnah said with a sigh, “only trained you to make\nyour quips more quickly, for you knew you had to get them out before you\ncould reconsider and suppress them.”\nShallan cocked her head.\n“The punishments were incompetent,” Jasnah said. “Used upon one\nsuch as yourself, they were actually encouragement. A game. How much\nwould you have to say to earn a punishment? Could you say something so\nclever that your tutors missed the joke? Sitting in the corner just gave you\nmore time to compose retorts.”\n“But it’s unseemly for a young woman to speak as I so often do.”\n“The only ‘unseemly’ thing is to not channel your intelligence usefully.\nConsider. You have trained yourself to do something very similar to what\nannoys you in the scholars: cleverness without thought behind it—\nintelligence, one might say, without a foundation of proper consideration.”\nJasnah turned a page. “Errorgant, wouldn’t you say?”\nShallan blushed.\n“I prefer my wards to be clever,” Jasnah said. “It gives me more to\nwork with. I should bring you to court with me. I suspect that Wit, at least,\nwould find you amusing—if only because your apparent natural timidity\nand your clever tongue make such an intriguing combination.”\n“Yes, Brightness.”\n“Please, just remember that a woman’s mind is her most precious\nweapon.

It must not be employed clumsily or prematurely. Much like the\naforementioned knife to the back, a clever gibe is most effective when it is\nunanticipated.”\n“I’m sorry, Brightness.”\n“It wasn’t an admonition,” Jasnah said, turning a page. “Simply an\nobservation. I make them on occasion: Those books are musty. The sky is\nblue today. My ward is a smart-lipped reprobate.”\nShallan smiled.\n“Now, tell me what you’ve discovered.”\nShallan grimaced. “Not much, Brightness. Or should I say too much?\nEach writer has her own theories on why the Parshendi killed your father.\nSome claim he must have insulted them at the feast that night. Others say\nthat the entire treaty was a ruse, intended to get the Parshendi close to him.\nBut that makes little sense, as they had much better opportunities earlier.”\n“And the Assassin in White?” Jasnah asked.\n“A true anomaly,” Shallan said. “The undertexts are filled with\ncommentary about him. Why would the Parshendi hire an outside assassin?\nDid they fear they could not accomplish the job themselves? Or perhaps\nthey didn’t hire him, and were framed. Many think that is unlikely,\nconsidering that the Parshendi took credit for the murder.”\n“And your thoughts?”\n“I feel inadequate to draw conclusions, Brightness.”\n“What is the point of research if not to draw conclusions?”\n“My tutors told me that supposition was only for the very\nexperienced,” Shallan explained.\nJasnah sniffed. “Your tutors were idiots. Youthful immaturity is one of\nthe cosmere’s great catalysts for change, Shallan. Do you realize that the\nSunmaker was only seventeen when he began his conquest? Gavarah hadn’t\nreached her twentieth Weeping when she proposed the theory of the three\nrealms.”\n“But for every Sunmaker or Gavarah, are there not a hundred\nGregorhs?” He had been a youthful king notorious for beginning a pointless\nwar with kingdoms that had been his father’s allies.\n“There was only one Gregorh,” Jasnah said with a grimace,\n“thankfully. Your point is a valid one. Hence the purpose of education. To\nbe young is about action. To be a scholar is about informed action.”\n“Or about sitting in an alcove reading about a five-year-old murder.”\n“I would not have you studying this if there were no point to it,”\nJasnah said, opening up another of her own books. “Too many scholars\nthink of research as purely a cerebral pursuit. If we do nothing with the\nknowledge we gain, then we have wasted our study. Books can store\ninformation better than we can—what we do that books cannot is interpret.\nSo if one is not going to draw conclusions, then one might as well just leave\nthe information in the texts.”\nShallan sat back, thoughtful. Presented that way, it somehow made her\nwant to dig back into the studies. What was it that Jasnah wanted her to do\nwith the information? Once again, she felt a stab of guilt.

Jasnah was taking\ngreat pains to instruct her in scholarship, and she was going to reward the\nwoman by stealing her most valuable possession and leaving a broken\nreplacement. It made Shallan feel sick.\nShe had expected study beneath Jasnah to involve meaningless\nmemorization and busywork, accompanied by chastisement for not being\nsmart enough. That was how her tutors had approached her instruction.\nJasnah was different. She gave Shallan a topic and the freedom to pursue it\nas she wished. Jasnah offered encouragement and speculation, but nearly all\nof their conversations turned to topics like the true nature of scholarship, the\npurpose of studying, the beauty of knowledge and its application.\nJasnah Kholin truly loved learning, and she wanted others to as well.\nBehind the stern gaze, intense eyes, and rarely smiling lips, Jasnah Kholin\ntruly believed in what she was doing. Whatever that was.\nShallan raised one of her books, but covertly eyed the spines of\nJasnah’s latest stack of tomes. More histories about the Heraldic Epochs.\nMythologies, commentaries, books by scholars known to be wild\nspeculators. Jasnah’s current volume was called Shadows Remembered.\nShallan memorized the title. She would try to find a copy and look through\nit.\nWhat was Jasnah pursuing? What secrets was she hoping to pry from\nthese volumes, most of them centuries-old copies of copies? Though\nShallan had discovered some secrets regarding the Soulcaster, the nature of\nJasnah’s quest—the reason the princess had come to Kharbranth—remained\nelusive. Maddeningly, yet tantalizingly, so. Jasnah liked to speak of the\ngreat women of the past, ones who had not just recorded history, but shaped\nit. Whatever it was she studied, she felt that it was important. World-\nchanging.\nYou mustn’t be drawn in, Shallan told herself, settling back with book\nand notes. Your goal is not to change the world. Your goal is to protect your\nbrothers and your house.\nStill, she needed to make a good show of her wardship. And that gave\nher a reason to immerse herself for two hours until footsteps in the hallway\ninterrupted. Likely the servants bringing the midday meal. Jasnah and\nShallan often ate on their balcony.\nShallan’s stomach grumbled as she smelled the food, and she gleefully\nset aside her book. She usually sketched at lunch, an activity that Jasnah—\ndespite her dislike of the visual arts—encouraged. She said that highborn\nmen often thought drawing and painting to be “enticing” in a woman, and\nso Shallan should maintain her skills, if only for the purpose of attracting\nsuitors.\nShallan didn’t know whether to find that insulting or not. And what did\nit say about Jasnah’s own intentions for marriage that she herself never\nbothered with the more becoming feminine arts like music or drawing?\n“Your Majesty,” Jasnah said, rising smoothly.\nShallan started and looked hastily over her shoulder. The elderly king\nof Kharbranth was standing in the doorway, wearing magnificent orange\nand white robes with detailed embroidery. Shallan scrambled to her feet.\n“Brightness Jasnah,” the king said. “Am I interrupting?”"

Shallan scrambled to her feet.\n“Brightness Jasnah,” the king said. “Am I interrupting?”\n“Your company is never an interruption, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said.\nShe had to be as surprised as Shallan was, yet didn’t display a moment of\ndiscomfort or anxiety. “We were soon to take lunch, anyway.”\n“I know, Brightness,” Taravangian said. “I hope you don’t mind if I\njoin you.” A group of servants began bringing in food and a table.\n“Not at all,” Jasnah said.\nThe servants hurried to set things up, putting two different tablecloths\non the round table to separate the genders during dining. They secured the\nhalf-moons of cloth—red for the king, blue for the women—with weights at\nthe center. Covered plates filled with food followed: a clear, cold stew with\nsweet vegetables for the women, a spicy-smelling broth for the king.\nKharbranthians preferred soups for their lunches.\nShallan was surprised to see them set a place for her. Her father had\nnever eaten at the same table as his children—even she, his favorite, had\nbeen relegated to her own table. Once Jasnah sat, Shallan did likewise. Her\nstomach growled again, and the king waved for them to begin. His motions\nseemed ungainly compared with Jasnah’s elegance.\nShallan was soon eating contentedly—with grace, as a woman should,\nsafehand in her lap, using her freehand and a skewer to spear chunks of\nvegetable or fruit. The king slurped, but he wasn’t as noisy as many men.\nWhy had he deigned to visit? Wouldn’t a formal dinner invitation have been\nmore proper? Of course, she’d learned that Taravangian wasn’t known for\nhis mastery of protocol. He was a popular king, beloved by the darkeyes as\na builder of hospitals. However, the lighteyes considered him less than\nbright.\nHe was not an idiot. In lighteyed politics, unfortunately, being only\naverage was a disadvantage. As they ate, the silence drew out, becoming\nawkward. Several times, the king looked as if he wanted to say something,\nbut then turned back to his soup. He seemed intimidated by Jasnah.\n“And how is your granddaughter, Your Majesty?” Jasnah eventually\nasked. “She is recovering well?”\n“Quite well, thank you,” Taravangian said, as if relieved to begin\nconversing. “Though she now avoids the narrower corridors of the\nConclave. I do want to thank you for your aid.”\n“It is always fulfilling to be of service, Your Majesty.”\n“If you will forgive my saying so, the ardents do not think much of\nyour service,” Taravangian said. “I realize it is likely a sensitive topic.\nPerhaps I shouldn’t mention it, but—”\n“No, feel free,” Jasnah said, eating a small green lurnip from the end\nof her skewer. “I am not ashamed of my choices.”\n“Then you’ll forgive an old man’s curiosity?”\n“I always forgive curiosity, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said. “It strikes me\nas one of the most genuine of emotions.”\n“Then where did you find it?” Taravangian asked, nodding toward the"

Me?” The elderly man seemed to find that amusing, and\nfor a moment, Shallan thought she saw deep regret in his expression.\n“Unlikely. But that is something else entirely. Please. I stand by my\nquestions.”\n“And I stand by my evasiveness, Your Majesty. I’m sorry. I do forgive\nyour curiosity, but I cannot reward it. These secrets are mine.”\n“Of course, of course.” The king sat back, looking embarrassed. “Now\nyou probably assume I brought this meal simply to ambush you about the\nfabrial.”\n“You had another purpose, then?”\n“Well, you see, I’ve heard the most wonderful things about your\nward’s artistic skill. I thought that maybe…” He smiled at Shallan.\n“Of course, Your Majesty,” Shallan said. “I’d be happy to draw your\nlikeness.”\nHe beamed as she stood, leaving her meal half eaten and gathering her\nthings. She glanced at Jasnah, but the older woman’s face was unreadable.\n“Would you prefer a simple portrait against a white background?”\nShallan asked. “Or would you prefer a broader perspective, including\nsurroundings?”\n“Perhaps,” Jasnah said pointedly, “you should wait until the meal is\nfinished, Shallan?”\nShallan blushed, feeling a fool for her enthusiasm. “Of course.”\n“No, no,” the king said. “I’m quite finished. A wider sketch would be\nperfect, child. How would you like me to sit?” He slid his chair back,\nposing and smiling in a grandfatherly way.\nShe blinked, fixing the image in her mind. “That is perfect, Your\nMajesty. You can return to your meal.”\n“Don’t you need me to sit still? I’ve posed for portraits before.”\n“It’s all right,” Shallan assured him, sitting down.\n“Very well,” he said, pulling back to the table. “I do apologize for\nmaking you use me, of all people, as a subject for your art. This face of\nmine isn’t the most impressive one you’ve depicted, I’m sure.”\n“Nonsense,” Shallan said. “A face like yours is just what an artist\nneeds.”\n“It is?”\n“Yes, the—” She cut herself off. She’d been about to quip, Yes, the skin\nis enough like parchment to make an ideal canvas. “…that handsome nose\nof yours, and wise furrowed skin. It will be quite striking in the black\ncharcoal.”\n“Oh, well then. Proceed. Though I still can’t see how you’ll work\nwithout me holding a pose.”\n“Brightness Shallan has some unique talents,” Jasnah said.

He says the staff is quite taken with your young\nward. How did you find her?”\n“Unexpectedly,” Jasnah said, “and in need of an education.”\nThe king cocked his head.\n“The artistic skill, I cannot claim,” Jasnah said. “It was a preexisting\ncondition.”\n“Ah, a blessing of the Almighty.”\n“You might say that.”\n“But you would not, I assume?” Taravangian chuckled awkwardly.\nShallan drew quickly, establishing the shape of his head. He shuffled\nuncomfortably. “Is it hard for you, Jasnah? Painful, I mean?”\n“Atheism is not a disease, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said dryly. “It’s not as\nif I’ve caught a foot rash.”\n“Of course not, of course not. But…er, isn’t it difficult, having nothing\nin which to believe?”\nShallan leaned forward, still sketching, but keeping her attention on\nthe conversation. Shallan had assumed that training under a heretic would\nbe a little more exciting. She and Kabsal—the witty ardent whom she’d met\non her first day in Kharbranth—had chatted several times now about\nJasnah’s faith. However, around Jasnah herself, the topic almost never came\nup. When it did, Jasnah usually changed it.\nToday, however, she did not. Perhaps she sensed the sincerity in the\nking’s question. “I wouldn’t say that I have nothing to believe in, Your\nMajesty. Actually, I have much to believe in. My brother and my uncle, my\nown abilities. The things I was taught by my parents.”\n“But, what is right and wrong, you’ve…Well, you’ve discarded that.”\n“Just because I do not accept the teachings of the devotaries does not\nmean I’ve discarded a belief in right and wrong.”\n“But the Almighty determines what is right!”\n“Must someone, some unseen thing, declare what is right for it to be\nright? I believe that my own morality—which answers only to my heart—is\nmore sure and true than the morality of those who do right only because\nthey fear retribution.”\n“But that is the soul of law,” the king said, sounding confused. “If\nthere is no punishment, there can be only chaos.”\n“If there were no law, some men would do as they wish, yes,” Jasnah\nsaid. “But isn’t it remarkable that, given the chance for personal gain at the\ncost of others, so many people choose what is right?”\n“Because they fear the Almighty.”\n“No,” Jasnah said. “I think something innate in us understands that\nseeking the good of society is usually best for the individual as well.\nHumankind is noble, when we give it the chance to be. That nobility is\nsomething that exists independent of any god’s decree.”\n“I just don’t see how anything could be outside God’s decrees.” The\nking shook his head, bemused. “Brightness Jasnah, I don’t mean to argue,"

Jasnah’s sphere lamps cast a cool, even white\nlight across them. For an uncomfortable moment, the only sound was the\nscratching of Shallan’s charcoal on her drawing pad. She worked with\nquick, scraping motions, disturbed by the things that Jasnah had said. They\nmade her feel hollow inside. That was partly because the king, for all his\naffability, was not good at arguing. He was a dear man, but no match for\nJasnah in a conversation.\n“Well,” Taravangian said, “I must say that you make your points quite\neffectively. I don’t accept them, though.”\n“My intention is not to convert, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said. “I am\ncontent keeping my beliefs to myself, something most of my colleagues in\nthe devotaries have difficulty doing. Shallan, have you finished yet?”\n“Quite nearly, Brightness.”\n“But it’s been barely a few minutes!” the king said.\n“She has remarkable skill, Your Majesty,” Jasnah said. “As I believe I\nmentioned.”\nShallan sat back, inspecting her piece. She’d been so focused on the\nconversation, she’d just let her hands do the drawing, trusting in her\ninstincts. The sketch depicted the king, sitting in his chair with a wise\nexpression, the turretlike balcony walls behind him. The doorway into the\nbalcony was to his right. Yes, it was a good likeness. Not her best work, but\n—\nShallan froze, her breath catching, her heart lurching in her chest. She\nhad drawn something standing in the doorway behind the king. Two tall and\nwillowy creatures with cloaks that split down the front and hung at the sides\ntoo stiffly, as if they were made of glass. Above the stiff, high collars, where\nthe creatures’ heads should be, each had a large, floating symbol of twisted\ndesign full of impossible angles and geometries.\nShallan sat, stunned. Why had she drawn those things? What had\ndriven her to—\nShe snapped her head up. The hallway was empty. The creatures\nhadn’t been part of the Memory she’d taken. Her hands had simply drawn\nthem of their accord.\n“Shallan?” Jasnah said.\nBy reflex, Shallan dropped her charcoal and grabbed the sheet in her\nfreehand, crumpling it. “I’m sorry, Brightness. I paid too much attention to\nthe conversation. I let myself grow sloppy.”\n“Well, certainly we can at least see it, child,” the king said, standing."

I let myself grow sloppy.”\n“Well, certainly we can at least see it, child,” the king said, standing.\nShallan tightened her grip. “Please, no!”\n“She has an artist’s temperament at times, Your Majesty.” Jasnah\nsighed. “There will be no getting it out of her.”\n“I’ll do you another, Your Majesty,” Shallan said. “I’m so sorry.”\nHe rubbed his wispy beard. “Yes, well, it was going to be a gift for my\ngranddaughter….”\n“By the end of the day,” Shallan promised.\n“That would be wonderful. You’re certain you don’t need me to pose?”\n“No, no, that won’t be necessary, Your Majesty,” Shallan said. Her\npulse was still racing and she couldn’t shake the image of those two\ndistorted figures from her mind, so she took another Memory of the king.\nShe could use that to create a more suitable picture.\n“Well then,” the king said. “I suppose I should be going. I wish to visit\none of the hospitals and the sick. You can send the drawing to my rooms,\nbut take your time. Really, it is quite all right.”\nShallan curtsied, crushed paper still held to her breast. The king\nwithdrew with his attendants, several parshmen entering to remove the\ntable.\n“I’ve never known you to make a mistake in drawing,” Jasnah said,\nsitting back down at the desk. “At least not one so horrible that you\ndestroyed the paper.”\nShallan blushed.\n“Even the master of an art may err, I suppose. Go ahead and take the\nnext hour to do His Majesty a proper portrait.”\nShallan looked down at the ruined sketch. The creatures were simply\nher fancy, the product of letting her mind wander. That was all. Just\nimagination. Perhaps there was something in her subconscious that she’d\nneeded to express. But what could the figures mean, then?\n“I noticed that at one point when you were speaking to the king, you\nhesitated,” Jasnah said. “What didn’t you say?”\n“Something inappropriate.”\n“But clever?”\n“Cleverness never seems quite so impressive when regarded outside\nthe moment, Brightness. It was just a silly thought.”\n“And you replaced it with an empty compliment. I think you\nmisunderstood what I was trying to explain, child. I do not wish for you to\nremain silent. It is good to be clever.”\n“But if I’d spoken,” Shallan said, “I’d have insulted the king, perhaps\nconfused him as well, which would have caused him embarrassment. I am\ncertain he knows what people say about his slowness of thought.”\nJasnah sniffed. “Idle words. From foolish people. But perhaps it was\nwise not to speak, though keep in mind that channeling your capacities and\nstifling them are two separate things. I’d much prefer you to think of\nsomething both clever and appropriate.”\n“Yes, Brightness.”\n“Besides,” Jasnah said, “I believe you might have made Taravangian\nlaugh. He seems haunted by something lately.”\n“You don’t find him dull, then?” Shallan asked, curious. She herself\ndidn’t think the king dull or a fool, but she’d thought someone as intelligent"

She herself\ndidn’t think the king dull or a fool, but she’d thought someone as intelligent\nand learned as Jasnah might not have patience for a man like him.\n“Taravangian is a wonderful man,” Jasnah said, “and worth a hundred\nself-proclaimed experts on courtly ways. He reminds me of my uncle\nDalinar. Earnest, sincere, concerned.”\n“The lighteyes here say he’s weak,” Shallan said. “Because he panders\nto so many other monarchs, because he fears war, because he doesn’t have a\nShardblade.”\nJasnah didn’t reply, though she looked disturbed.\n“Brightness?” Shallan prodded, walking to her own seat and arranging\nher charcoals.\n“In ancient days,” Jasnah said, “a man who brought peace to his\nkingdom was considered to be of great worth. Now that same man would be\nderided as a coward.” She shook her head. “It has been centuries coming,\nthis change. It should terrify us. We could do with more men like\nTaravangian, and I shall require you to never call him dull again, not even\nin passing.”\n“Yes, Brightness,” Shallan said, bowing her head. “Did you really\nbelieve the things you said? About the Almighty?”\nJasnah was quiet for a moment. “I do. Though perhaps I overstated my\nconviction.”\n“The Assuredness Movement of rhetorical theory?”\n“Yes,” Jasnah said. “I suppose that it was. I must be careful not to put\nmy back toward you as I read today.”\nShallan smiled.\n“A true scholar must not close her mind close on any topic,” Jasnah\nsaid, “no matter how certain she may feel. Just because I have not yet found\na convincing reason to join one of the devotaries does not mean I never\nwill. Though each time I have a discussion like the one today, my\nconvictions grow firmer.”\nShallan bit her lip. Jasnah noticed the expression. “You will need to\nlearn to control that, Shallan. It makes your feelings obvious.”\n“Yes, Brightness.”\n“Well, out with it.”\n“Just that your conversation with the king was not entirely fair.”\n“Oh?”\n“Because of his, well, you know. His limited capacity. He did quite\nremarkably, but didn’t make the arguments that someone more versed in\nVorin theology might have.”\n“And what arguments might such a one have made?”\n“Well, I’m not very well trained in that area myself. But I do think that\nyou ignored, or at least minimized, one vital part of the discussion.”\n“Which is?”\nShallan tapped at her breast. “Our hearts, Brightness. I believe because\nI feel something, a closeness to the Almighty, a peace that comes when I\nlive my faith.”\n“The mind is capable of projecting expected emotional responses.”\n“But didn’t you yourself argue that the way we act—the way we feel\nabout right and wrong—was a defining attribute of our humanity? You used\nour innate morality to prove your point. So how can you discard my\nfeelings?”\n“Discard them? No. Regard them with skepticism? Perhaps. Your"

Your\nfeelings, Shallan—however powerful—are your own. Not mine. And what I\nfeel is that spending my life trying to earn the favor of an unseen, unknown,\nand unknowable being who watches me from the sky is an exercise in sheer\nfutility.” She pointed at Shallan with her pen. “But your rhetorical method\nis improving. We’ll make a scholar of you yet.”\nShallan smiled, feeling a surge of pleasure. Praise from Jasnah was\nmore precious than an emerald broam.\nBut…I’m not going to be a scholar. I’m going to steal the Soulcaster\nand leave.\nShe didn’t like to think about that. That was something else she’d have\nto get over; she tended to avoid thinking about things that made her\nuncomfortable.\n“Now hurry and be about the king’s sketch,” Jasnah said, lifting a\nbook. “You still have a great deal of real work to do once you are done\ndrawing.”\n“Yes, Brightness,” Shallan said.\nFor once, however, she found sketching difficult, her mind too\ntroubled to focus.\n“They were suddenly dangerous. Like a calm day that became a\ntempest.”\n—This fragment is the origin of a Thaylen proverb that was eventually\nreworked into a more common derivation. I believe it may reference\nthe Voidbringers. See Ixsix’s Emperor, fourth chapter.\nKaladin walked from the cavernous barrack into the pure light of first\nmorning. Bits of quartz in the ground sparkled before him, catching the\nlight, as if the ground were sparking and burning, ready to burst from\nwithin.\nA group of twenty-nine men followed him. Slaves. Thieves. Deserters.\nForeigners. Even a few men whose only sin had been poverty. Those had\njoined the bridge crews out of desperation. The pay was good when\ncompared with nothing, and they were promised that if they survived a\nhundred bridge runs, they would be promoted. Assignment to a watch post\n—which, in the mind of a poor man, sounded like a life of luxury. Being\npaid to stand and look at things all day? What kind of insanity was that? It\nwas like being rich, almost.\nThey didn’t understand. Nobody survived a hundred bridge runs.\nKaladin had been on two dozen, and he was already one of the most\nexperienced living bridgemen.\nBridge Four followed him. The last of the holdouts—a thin man named\nBisig—had given in yesterday. Kaladin preferred to think that the laughter,\nthe food, and the humanity had finally gotten to him. But it had probably\nbeen a few glares or under-the-breath threats from Rock and Teft.\nKaladin turned a blind eye to those. He’d eventually need the men’s\nloyalty, but for now, he’d settle for obedience.\nHe guided them through the morning exercises he’d learned his very\nfirst day in the military. Stretches followed by jumping motions. Carpenters\nin brown work overalls and tan or green caps passed on their way to the\nlumberyard, shaking their heads in amusement.

Soldiers on the short ridge\nabove, where the camp proper began, looked down and laughed. Gaz\nwatched from beside a nearby barrack, arms folded, single eye dissatisfied.\nKaladin wiped his brow. He met Gaz’s eye for a long moment, then\nturned back to the men. There was still time to practice hauling the bridge\nbefore breakfast.\nGaz had never gotten used to having just one eye. Could a man get used to\nthat? He’d rather have lost a hand or a leg than that eye. He couldn’t stop\nfeeling that something hid in that darkness he couldn’t see, but others could.\nWhat lurked there? Spren that would drain his soul from his body? The way\na rat could empty an entire wineskin by chewing the corner?\nHis companions called him lucky. “That blow could have taken your\nlife.” Well, at least then he wouldn’t have had to live with that darkness.\nOne of his eyes was always closed. Close the other, and the darkness\nswallowed him.\nGaz glanced left, and the darkness scuttled to the side. Lamaril stood\nleaning against a post, tall and slim. He was not a massive man, but he was\nnot weak. He was all lines. Rectangular beard. Rectangular body. Sharp.\nLike a knife.\nLamaril waved Gaz over, so he reluctantly approached. Then he took a\nsphere out of his pouch and passed it over. A topaz mark. He hated losing it.\nHe always hated losing money.\n“You owe me twice as much as this,” Lamaril noted, raising the sphere\nup to look through it as it sparkled in the sunlight.\n“Well, that’s all you’ll get for now. Be glad you get anything.”\n“Be glad I’ve kept my mouth shut,” Lamaril said lazily, leaning back\nagainst his post. It was one that marked the edge of the lumberyard.\nGaz gritted his teeth. He hated to pay, but what else could he do?\nStorms take him. Raging storms take him!\n“You have a problem, it seems,” Lamaril said.\nAt first, Gaz thought he meant the half payment. The lighteyed man\nnodded toward Bridge Four’s barracks.\nGaz eyed the bridgemen, unsettled. The youthful bridgeleader barked\nan order, and the bridgemen raced the span of the lumberyard in a jog. He\nalready had them running in time with one another. That one change meant\nso much. It sped them up, helped them think like a team.\nCould this boy actually have military training, as he’d once claimed?\nWhy would he be wasted as a bridgeman? Of course, there was that shash\nbrand on his forehead….\n“I don’t see a problem,” Gaz said with a grunt. “They’re fast. That’s\ngood.”\n“They’re insubordinate.”\n“They follow orders.”\n“His orders, perhaps.” Lamaril shook his head. “Bridgemen exist for\none purpose, Gaz. To protect the lives of more valuable men.”\n“Really? And here I thought their purpose was to carry bridges.”\nLamaril gave him a sharp look. He leaned forward. “Don’t try me,\nGaz. And don’t forget your place. Would you like to join them?”"

        "text": "Lamaril gave him a sharp look. He leaned forward. “Don’t try me,\nGaz. And don’t forget your place. Would you like to join them?”\nGaz felt a spike of fear. Lamaril was a very lowly lighteyes, one of the\nlandless. But he was Gaz’s immediate superior, a liaison between bridge\ncrews and the higher-ranked lighteyes who oversaw the lumberyard.\nGaz looked down at the ground. “I’m sorry, Brightlord.”\n“Highprince Sadeas holds an edge,” Lamaril said, leaning back against\nhis post. “He maintains it by pushing us all. Hard. Each man in his place.”\nHe nodded toward the members of Bridge Four. “Speed is not a bad thing.\nInitiative is not a bad thing. But men with initiative like that boy’s are not\noften happy in their position. The bridge crews function as they are, without\nneed for modification. Change can be unsettling.”\nGaz doubted that any of the bridgemen really understood their place in\nSadeas’s plans. If they knew why they were worked as pitilessly as they\nwere—and why they were forbidden shields or armor—they likely would\njust cast themselves into the chasm. Bait. They were bait. Draw the\nParshendi attention, let the savages think they were doing some good by\nfelling a few bridges’ worth of bridgemen every assault. So long as you\ntook plenty of men, that didn’t matter. Except to those who were\nslaughtered.\nStormfather, Gaz thought, I hate myself for being a part of this. But\nhe’d hated himself for a long time now. It wasn’t anything new to him. “I’ll\ndo something,” he promised Lamaril. “A knife in the night. Poison in the\nfood.” That twisted his insides. The boy’s bribes were small, but they were\nall that let him keep ahead of his payments to Lamaril.\n“No!” Lamaril hissed. “You want it seen that he was really a threat?\nThe real soldiers are already talking about him.” Lamaril grimaced. “The\nlast thing we need is a martyr inspiring rebellion among the bridgemen. I\ndon’t want any hint of it; nothing our highprince’s enemies could take\nadvantage of.” Lamaril glanced at Kaladin, jogging past again with his men.\n“That one has to fall on the field, as he deserves. Make certain it happens.\nAnd get me the rest of the money you owe, or you’ll soon find yourself\ncarrying one of those bridges yourself.”\nHe swept away, forest-green cloak fluttering. In his time as a soldier,\nGaz had learned to fear the minor lighteyes the most. They were galled by\ntheir closeness in rank to the darkeyes, yet those darkeyes were the only\nones they had any authority over. That made them dangerous. Being around\na man like Lamaril was like handling a hot coal with bare fingers. There\nwas no way to avoid burning yourself. You just hoped to be quick enough to\nkeep the burns to a minimum.\nBridge Four ran by. A month ago, Gaz wouldn’t have believed this\npossible. A group of bridgemen, practicing? And all it seemed to have cost\nKaladin was a few bribes of food and some empty promises that he would\nprotect them."

And all it seemed to have cost\nKaladin was a few bribes of food and some empty promises that he would\nprotect them.\nThat shouldn’t have been enough. Life as a bridgeman was hopeless.\nGaz couldn’t join them. He just couldn’t. Kaladin the lordling had to fall.\nBut if Kaladin’s spheres vanished, Gaz could just as easily end up as a\nbridgeman for failing to pay Lamaril. Storming Damnation! he thought. It\nwas like trying to choose which claw of the chasmfiend would crush you.\nGaz continued to watch Kaladin’s crew. And still that darkness waited\nfor him. Like an itch that couldn’t be scratched. Like a scream that couldn’t\nbe silenced. A tingling numbness that he could never be rid of.\nIt would probably follow him even into death.\n“Bridge up!” Kaladin bellowed, running with Bridge Four. They raised the\nbridge over their heads while still moving. It was harder to run this way,\nholding the bridge up, rather than resting it on the shoulders. He felt its\nenormous weight on his arms.\n“Down!” he ordered.\nThose at the front let go of the bridge and ran out to the sides. The\nothers lowered the bridge in a quick motion. It hit the ground awkwardly,\nscraping the stone. They got into position, pretending to move it across a\nchasm. Kaladin helped at the side.\nWe’ll need to practice on a real chasm, he thought as the men finished.\nI wonder what kind of bribe it would take for Gaz to let me do that.\nThe bridgemen, finished with their mock bridge run, looked toward\nKaladin, exhausted but excited. He smiled at them. As a squadleader those\nmonths in Amaram’s army, he’d learned that praise should be honest, but it\nshould never be withheld.\n“We need to work on that set-down,” Kaladin said. “But overall, I’m\nimpressed. Two weeks and you’re already working together as well as some\nteams I trained for months. I’m pleased. And proud. Go get something to\ndrink and take a break. We’ll do one or two more runs before work detail.”\nIt was stone-gathering duty again, but that was nothing to complain\nabout. He’d convinced the men that lifting the stones would improve their\nstrength, and had enlisted the few he trusted the most to help gather the\nknobweed, the means by which he continued to—just barely—keep the men\nsupplied with extra food and build his stock of medical supplies.\nTwo weeks. An easy two weeks, as the lives of bridgemen went. Only\ntwo bridge runs, and on one they’d gotten to the plateau too late. The\nParshendi had escaped with the gemheart before they’d even arrived. That\nwas good for bridgemen.\nThe other assault hadn’t been too bad, by bridgeman numbers. Two\nmore dead: Amark and Koolf. Two more wounded: Narm and Peet. A\nfraction of what the other crews had lost, but still too many. Kaladin tried to\nkeep his expression optimistic as he walked to the water barrel and took a\nladle from one of the men, drinking it down.\nBridge Four would drown in its own wounded.

They were only thirty\nstrong, with five wounded who drew no pay and had to be fed out of the\nknobweed income. Counting those who’d died, they’d taken nearly thirty\npercent casualties in the weeks he’d begun trying to protect them. In\nAmaram’s army, that rate of casualties would have been catastrophic.\nBack then, Kaladin’s life had been one of training and marching,\npunctuated by occasional frenzied bursts of battle. Here, the fighting was\nrelentless. Every few days. That kind of thing could—would—wear an\narmy down.\nThere has to be a better way, Kaladin thought, swishing the lukewarm\nwater in his mouth, then pouring another ladle on his head. He couldn’t\ncontinue to lose two men a week to death and wounds. But how could they\nsurvive when their own officers didn’t care if they lived or died?\nHe barely kept himself from throwing the ladle into the barrel in\nfrustration. Instead, he handed it to Skar and gave him an encouraging\nsmile. A lie. But an important one.\nGaz watched from the shadow of one of the other bridgeman barracks.\nSyl’s translucent figure—shaped now like floating knobweed fluff—flitted\naround the bridge sergeant. Eventually, she made her way over to Kaladin,\nlanding on his shoulder, taking her female form.\n“He’s planning something,” she said.\n“He hasn’t interfered,” Kaladin said. “He hasn’t even tried to stop us\nfrom having the nightly stew.”\n“He was talking to that lighteyes.”\n“Lamaril?”\nShe nodded.\n“Lamaril’s his superior,” Kaladin said as he walked into the shade of\nBridge Four’s barrack. He leaned against the wall, looking over at his men\nby the water barrel. They talked to one another now. Joked. Laughed. They\nwent out drinking together in the evenings. Stormfather, but he never\nthought he’d be glad that the men under his command went drinking.\n“I didn’t like their expressions,” Syl said, sitting down on Kaladin’s\nshoulder. “Dark. Like thunderclouds. I didn’t hear what they were saying. I\nnoticed them too late. But I don’t like it, particularly that Lamaril.”\nKaladin nodded slowly.\n“You don’t trust him either?” Syl asked.\n“He’s a lighteyes.” That was enough.\n“So we—”\n“So we do nothing,” Kaladin said. “I can’t respond unless they try\nsomething. And if I spend all of my energy worrying about what they might\ndo, I won’t be able to solve the problems we’re facing right now.”\nWhat he didn’t add was his real worry. If Gaz or Lamaril decided to\nhave Kaladin killed, there was little he could to do to stop them. True,\nbridgemen were rarely executed for anything other than failing to run their\nbridge. But even in an “honest” force like Amaram’s, there had been rumors\nof trumped-up charges and fake evidence.

In Sadeas’s undisciplined, barely\nregulated camp, nobody would blink if Kaladin—a shash-branded slave—\nwere strung up on some nebulous charge. They could leave him for the\nhighstorm, washing their hands of his death, claiming that the Stormfather\nhad chosen his fate.\nKaladin stood up straight and walked toward the carpentry section of\nthe lumberyard. The craftsmen and their apprentices were hard at work\ncutting lengths of wood for spear hafts, bridges, posts, or furniture.\nThe craftsmen nodded to Kaladin as he passed. They were familiar\nwith him now, used to his odd requests, like pieces of lumber long enough\nfor four men to hold and run with to practice keeping cadence with one\nanother. He found a half-finished bridge. It had eventually grown out of that\none plank that Kaladin had used.\nKaladin knelt down, inspecting the wood. A group of men worked with\na large saw just to his right, slicing thin rounds off a log. Those would\nprobably become chair seats.\nHe ran his fingers along the smooth hardwood. All mobile bridges\nwere made of a kind of wood called makam. It had a deep brown color, the\ngrain almost hidden, and was both strong and light. The craftsmen had\nsanded this length smooth, and it smelled of sawdust and musky sap.\n“Kaladin?” Syl asked, walking through the air then stepping onto the\nwood. “You look distant.”\n“It’s ironic how well they craft these bridges,” he said. “This army’s\ncarpenters are far more professional than its soldiers.”\n“That makes sense,” she said. “The craftsmen want to make bridges\nthat last. The soldiers I listen to, they just want to get to the plateau, grab\nthe gemheart, and get away. It’s like a game to them.”\n“That’s astute. You’re getting better and better at observing us.”\nShe grimaced. “I feel more like I’m remembering things I once knew.”\n“Soon you’ll hardly be a spren at all. You’ll be a little translucent\nphilosopher. We’ll have to send you off to a monastery to spend your time\nin deep, important thoughts.”\n“Yes,” she said, “like how to best get the ardents there to accidentally\ndrink a mixture that will turn his mouth blue.” She smiled mischievously.\nKaladin smiled back, but kept running his finger across the wood. He\nstill didn’t understand why they wouldn’t let bridgemen carry shields.\nNobody would give him a straight answer on the question. “They use\nmakam because it’s strong enough for its weight to support a heavy cavalry\ncharge,” he said. “We should be able to use this. They deny us shields, but\nwe already carry one on our shoulders.”\n“But how would they react if you try that?”\nKaladin stood. “I don’t know, but I also don’t have any other choice.”\nTrying this would be a risk. A huge risk. But he’d run out of nonrisky\nideas days ago.\n“We can hold it here,” Kaladin said, pointing for Rock, Teft, Skar, and\nMoash.

The bottom was a complicated construction, with eight rows of\nthree positions accommodating up to twenty-four men directly underneath,\nthen sixteen sets of handles—eight on each side—for sixteen more men on\nthe outside. Forty men, running shoulder to shoulder, if they had a full\ncomplement.\nEach position underneath the bridge had an indentation for the\nbridgeman’s head, two curved blocks of wood to rest on his shoulders, and\ntwo rods for handholds. The bridgemen wore shoulder pads, and those who\nwere shorter wore extras to compensate. Gaz generally tried to assign new\nbridgemen to crews based on their height.\nThat didn’t hold for Bridge Four, of course. Bridge Four just got the\nleftovers.\nKaladin pointed to several rods and struts. “We could grab here, then\nrun straight forward, carrying the bridge on its side to our right at a slant.\nWe put our taller men on the outside and our shorter men on the inside.”\n“What good would that do?” Rock asked, frowning.\nKaladin glanced at Gaz, who was watching from nearby.\nUncomfortably close. Best not to speak of why he really wanted to carry the\nbridge on its side. Besides, he didn’t want to get the men’s hopes up until he\nknew if it would work.\n“I just want to experiment,” he said. “If we can shift positions\noccasionally, it might be easier. Work different muscles.” Syl frowned as\nshe stood on the top of the bridge. She always frowned when Kaladin\nobscured the truth.\n“Gather the men,” Kaladin said, waving to Rock, Teft, Skar, and\nMoash. He’d named the four as his subsquad commanders, something that\nbridgemen didn’t normally have. But soldiers worked best in smaller groups\nof six or eight.\nSoldiers, Kaladin thought. Is that how I think of them?\nThey didn’t fight. But yes, they were soldiers. It was too easy to\nunderestimate men when you considered them to be “just” bridgemen.\nCharging straight at enemy archers without shields took courage. Even\nwhen you were compelled to do it.\nHe glanced to the side, noticing that Moash hadn’t left with the other\nthree. The narrow-faced man had dark green eyes and brown hair flecked\nwith black.\n“Something wrong, soldier?” Kaladin asked.\nMoash blinked in surprise at the use of the word, but he and the others\nhad grown to expect all kinds of unorthodoxy from Kaladin. “Why did you\nmake me leader of a subsquad?”\n“Because you resisted my leadership longer than almost any of the\nothers. And you were flat-out more vocal about it than any of them.”\n“You made me a squad leader because I refused to obey you?”\n“I made you squad leader because you struck me as capable and\nintelligent. But beyond that, you weren’t swayed too easily. You’re strong-\nwilled. I can use that.”\nMoash scratched his chin, with its short beard. “All right then. But\nunlike Teft and that Horneater, I don’t think you’re a gift straight from the\nAlmighty. I don’t trust you.”\n“Then why obey me?”"

What had possessed them to try carrying the\nbridge to the side?\nIt required them to clump up in an odd way, forming three rows\ninstead of five, awkwardly clutching the underside of the bridge and\nholding it off to their right. It was one of the strangest things he’d ever seen.\nThey could barely all fit, and the handholds weren’t made for carrying the\nbridge that way.\nGaz scratched his head as he watched them pass, then held out a hand,\nstopping Kaladin as he jogged by. The lordling let go of the bridge and\nhurried up to Gaz, wiping his brow as the others continued running. “Yes?”\n“What is that?” Gaz said, pointing.\n“Bridge crew. Carrying what I believe is…yes, it’s a bridge.”\n“I didn’t ask for lip,” Gaz snarled. “I want an explanation.”\n“Carrying the bridge over our heads gets tiring,” Kaladin said. He was\na tall man, tall enough to tower over Gaz. Storm it, I will not be intimidated!\n“This is a way to use different muscles. Like shifting a pack from one\nshoulder to the other.”\nGaz glanced to the side. Had something moved in the darkness?\n“Gaz?” Kaladin asked.\n“Look, lordling,” Gaz said, looking back to him. “Carrying it overhead\nmay be tiring, but carrying it like that is just plain stupid. You look like\nyou’re about to stumble over one another, and the handholds are terrible.\nYou can barely fit the men.”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said more softly. “But a lot of the time, only half of a\nbridge crew will survive a bridge run. We can carry it back this way when\nthere are fewer of us. It will let us shift positions, at least.”\nGaz hesitated. Only half a bridge crew…\nIf they carried the bridge like that on an actual assault, they’d go\nslowly, expose themselves. It could be a disaster, for Bridge Four at least.\nGaz smiled. “I like it.”\nKaladin looked shocked. “What?”\n“Initiative. Creativity. Yes, keep practicing. I’d very much like to see\nyou make a plateau approach carrying the bridge that way.”\nKaladin narrowed his eyes. “Is that so?”\n“Yes,” Gaz said.\n“Well then. Perhaps we will.”\nGaz smiled, watching Kaladin retreat. A disaster was exactly what he\nneeded. Now he just had to find some other way to pay Lamaril’s blackmail.\nSIX YEARS AGO\n“Don’t make the same mistake I did, son.”\nKal looked up from his folio. His father sat on the other side of the\noperating room, one hand to his head, half-empty cup of wine in his other.\nViolet wine, among the strongest of liquors.\nLirin set the cup down, and the deep purple liquid—the color of\ncremling blood—shivered and trembled.

It refracted Stormlight from a\ncouple of spheres sitting on the counter.\n“Father?”\n“When you get to Kharbranth, stay there.” His voice was slurred.\n“Don’t get sucked back to this tiny, backward, foolish town. Don’t force\nyour beautiful wife to live away from everyone else she’s ever known or\nloved.”\nKal’s father didn’t often get drunk; this was a rare night of indulgence.\nPerhaps because Mother had gone to sleep early, exhausted from her work.\n“You’ve always said I should come back,” Kal said softly.\n“I’m an idiot.” His back to Kal, he stared at the wall splashed with\nwhite light from the spheres. “They don’t want me here. They never wanted\nme here.”\nKal looked down at his folio. It contained drawings of dissected\nbodies, the muscles splayed and pulled out. The drawings were so detailed.\nEach had glyphpairs to designate every part, and he’d committed those to\nmemory. Now he studied the procedures, delving into the bodies of men\nlong dead.\nOnce, Laral had told him that men weren’t supposed to see beneath the\nskin. These folios, with their pictures, were part of what made everyone so\nmistrustful of Lirin. Seeing beneath was like seeing beneath the clothing,\nonly worse.\nLirin poured himself more wine. How much the world could change in\na short time. Kal pulled his coat close against the chill. A season of winter\nhad come, but they couldn’t afford charcoal for the brazier, for patients no\nlonger gave offerings. Lirin hadn’t stopped healing or surgery. The\ntownspeople had simply stopped their donations, all at a word from\nRoshone.\n“He shouldn’t be able to do this,” Kal whispered.\n“But he can,” Lirin said. He wore a white shirt and black vest atop tan\ntrousers. The vest was unbuttoned, the front flaps hanging down by his\nsides, like the skin pulled back from the torsos of the men in Kal’s\ndrawings.\n“We could spend the spheres,” Kal said hesitantly.\n“Those are for your education,” Lirin snapped. “If I could send you\nnow, I would.”\nKal’s father and mother had sent a letter to the surgeons in Kharbranth,\nasking them to let Kal take the entry tests early. They’d responded in the\nnegative.\n“He wants us to spend them,” Lirin said, words slurred. “That’s why\nhe said what he did. He’s trying to bully us into needing those spheres.”\nRoshone’s words to the townspeople hadn’t exactly been a command.\nHe’d just implied that if Kal’s father was too foolish to charge, then he\nshouldn’t be paid. The next day, people had stopped donating.\nThe townsfolk regarded Roshone with a confusing mixture of\nadoration and fear. In Kal’s opinion, he didn’t deserve either. Obviously, the\nman had been banished to Hearthstone because he was so bitter and flawed.\nHe clearly didn’t deserve to be among the real lighteyes, who fought for\nvengeance on the Shattered Plains."

Was that the wine talking?\nKal’s father turned, his eyes reflecting pure Stormlight. In those eyes,\nKal saw a surprising lucidity. He wasn’t so drunk after all. “Brightlord\nWistiow let men do as they wished. And so they ignored him. Roshone lets\nthem know he finds them contemptible. And so they scramble to please\nhim.”\n“That makes no sense,” Kal said.\n“It is the way of things,” Lirin said, playing with one of the spheres on\nthe table, rolling it beneath his finger. “You’ll have to learn this, Kal. When\nmen perceive the world as being right, we are content. But if we see a hole\n—a deficiency—we scramble to fill it.”\n“You make it sound noble, what they do.”\n“It is in a way,” Lirin said. He sighed. “I shouldn’t be so hard on our\nneighbors. They’re petty, yes, but it’s the pettiness of the ignorant. I’m not\ndisgusted by them. I’m disgusted by the one who manipulates them. A man\nlike Roshone can take what is honest and true in men and twist it into a\nmess of sludge to walk on.” He took a sip, finishing the wine.\n“We should just spend the spheres,” Kal said. “Or send them\nsomewhere, to a moneylender or something. If they were gone, he’d leave\nus alone.”\n“No,” Lirin said softly. “Roshone is not the kind to spare a man once\nhe is beaten. He’s the type who keeps kicking. I don’t know what political\nmistake landed him in this place, but he obviously can’t get revenge on his\nrivals. So we’re all he has.” Lirin paused. “Poor fool.”\nPoor fool? Kal thought. He’s trying to destroy our lives, and that’s all\nFather can say?\nWhat of the stories men sang at the hearths? Tales of clever herdsmen\noutwitting and overthrowing a foolish lighteyed man. There were dozens of\nvariations, and Kal had heard them all. Shouldn’t Lirin fight back\nsomehow? Do something other than sit and wait?\nBut he didn’t say anything; he knew exactly what Lirin would say. Let\nme worry about it. Get back to your studies.\nSighing, Kal settled back in his chair, opening his folio again. The\nsurgery room was dim, lit by the four spheres on the table and a single one\nKal used for reading. Lirin kept most of the spheres closed up in their\ncupboard, hidden away. Kal held up his own sphere, lighting the page.\nThere were longer explanations of procedures in the back that his mother\ncould read to him. She was the only woman in the town who could read,\nthough Lirin said it wasn’t uncommon among wellborn darkeyed women in\nthe cities."

She was the only woman in the town who could read,\nthough Lirin said it wasn’t uncommon among wellborn darkeyed women in\nthe cities.\nAs he studied, Kal idly pulled something from his pocket. A rock that\nhad been sitting on his chair for him when he’d come in to study. He\nrecognized it as a favorite one that Tien had been carrying around recently.\nNow he’d left it for Kaladin; he often did that, hoping that his older brother\nwould be able to see the beauty in it too, though they all just looked like\nordinary rocks. He’d have to ask Tien what he found so special about this\nparticular one. There was always something.\nTien spent his days now learning carpentry from Ral, one of the men in\nthe town. Lirin had set him to it reluctantly; he’d been hoping for another\nsurgery assistant, but Tien couldn’t stand the sight of blood. He froze every\ntime, and hadn’t gotten used to it. That was troubling. Kal had hoped that\nhis father would have Tien as an assistant when he left. And Kal was\nleaving, one way or another. He hadn’t decided between the army or\nKharbranth, though in recent months, he’d begun leaning toward becoming\na spearman.\nIf he took that route, he’d have to do it stealthily, once he was old\nenough that the recruiters would take him over his parents’ objections.\nFifteen would probably be old enough. Five more months. For now, he\nfigured that knowing the muscles—and vital parts of a body—would be\npretty useful for either a surgeon or a spearman.\nA thump came at the door. Kal jumped. It hadn’t been a knock, but a\nthump. It came again. It sounded like something heavy pushing or\nslamming against the wood.\n“What in the stormwinds?” Lirin said, rising from his stool. He crossed\nthe small room; his undone vest brushed the operating table, button\nscraping the wood.\nAnother thump. Kal scrambled out of his chair, closing the folio. At\nfourteen and a half, he was nearly as tall as his father now. A scraping came\nat the door, like nails or claws. Kal raised a hand toward his father,\nsuddenly terrified. It was late at night, dark in the room, and the town was\nsilent.\nThere was something outside. It sounded like a beast. Inhuman. A den\nof whitespines were said to be making trouble nearby, striking at travelers\non the roadway. Kal had an image in his head of the reptilian creatures, as\nbig as horses but with carapace across their backs. Was one of them sniffing\nat the door? Brushing it, trying to force its way in?\n“Father!” Kal yelped.\nLirin pulled open the door. The dim light of the spheres revealed not a\nmonster, but a man wearing black clothing. He had a long metal bar in his\nhands, and he wore a black wool mask with holes cut for the eyes. Kal felt\nhis heart race in panic as the would-be intruder leapt backward.\n“Didn’t expect to find anyone inside, did you?” Kal’s father said. “It’s\nbeen years since there was a theft in the town. I’m ashamed of you.”"

I’m ashamed of you.”\n“Give us the spheres!” a voice called out of the darkness. Another\nfigure moved in the shadows, and then another.\nStormfather! Kal clutched the folio to his chest with trembling hands.\nHow many are there? Highwaymen, come to rob the town! Such things\nhappened. More and more frequently these days, Kal’s father said.\nHow could Lirin be so calm?\n“Those spheres ain’t yours,” another voice called.\n“Is that so?” Kal’s father said. “Does that make them yours? You think\nhe’d let you keep them?” Kal’s father spoke as if they weren’t bandits from\noutside the town. Kal crept forward to stand just behind his father,\nfrightened—but at the same time ashamed of that fear. The men in the\ndarkness were shadowy, nightmarish things, moving back and forth, faces\nof black.\n“We’ll give them to him,” one voice said.\n“No need for this to get violent, Lirin,” another added. “You ain’t\ngoing to spend them anyway.”\nKal’s father snorted. He ducked into the room. Kal cried out, moving\nback as Lirin threw open the cabinet where he kept the spheres. He grabbed\nthe large glass goblet that he stored them in; it was covered with a black\ncloth.\n“You want them?” Lirin called, walking to the doorway, passing Kal.\n“Father?” Kal said, panicked.\n“You want the light for yourself?” Lirin’s voice grew louder. “Here!”\nHe pulled the cloth free. The goblet exploded with fiery radiance, the\nbrightness nearly blinding. Kal raised his arm. His father was a shadowed\nsilhouette that seemed to hold the sun itself in its fingers.\nThe large goblet shone with a calm light. Almost a cold light. Kal\nblinked away tears, his eyes adjusting. He could see the men outside clearly\nnow. Where dangerous shadows had once loomed, cringing men now raised\nhands. They didn’t seem so intimidating; in fact, the cloths over their faces\nlooked ridiculous.\nWhere Kal had been afraid, he now felt strangely confident. For a\nmoment, it wasn’t light his father held, but understanding itself. That’s\nLuten, Kal thought, noticing a man who limped. It was easy to distinguish\nhim, despite the mask. Kal’s father had operated on that leg; it was because\nof him that Luten could still walk. He recognized others too. Horl was the\none with the wide shoulders, Balsas the man wearing the nice new coat.\nLirin didn’t say anything to them at first. He stood with that light\nblazing, illuminating the entire stone square outside. The men seemed to\nshrink down, as if they knew he recognized them.\n“Well?” Lirin said. “You’ve threatened violence against me. Come. Hit\nme. Rob me. Do it knowing I’ve lived among you almost my entire life. Do\nit knowing that I’ve healed your children. Come in. Bleed one of your\nown!”\nThe men faded into the night without a word.\n“They lived high atop a place no man could reach, but all could visit."

See page 27 of Varala’s translation, and note the undertext.\nThey got better at carrying the bridge on its side. But not much better.\nKaladin watched Bridge Four pass, moving awkwardly, maneuvering the\nbridge at their sides. Fortunately, there were plenty of handles on the\nbridge’s underside, and they’d found how to grip them in the right way.\nThey had to carry it at less steep an angle than he’d wanted. That would\nexpose their legs, but may be he could train them to adjust to it as the\narrows flew.\nAs it was, their carry was slow, and the bridgemen were so bunched up\nthat if the Parshendi managed to drop a man, the others would stumble over\nhim. Lose just a few men, and the balance would be upset so they’d drop it\nfor certain.\nThis will have to be handled very carefully, Kaladin thought.\nSyl fluttered along behind the bridge crew as a flurry of nearly\ntranslucent leaves. Beyond her, something caught Kaladin’s eye: a\nuniformed soldier leading a ragged group of men in a despondent clump.\nFinally, Kaladin thought. He’d been waiting for another group of recruits.\nHe waved curtly to Rock. The Horneater nodded; he’d take over training. It\nwas time for a break anyway.\nKaladin jogged up the short incline at the rim of the lumberyard,\narriving just as Gaz intercepted the newcomers.\n“What a sorry batch,” Gaz said. “I thought we’d been sent the dregs\nlast time, but this lot…”\nLamaril shrugged. “They’re yours now, Gaz. Split them up how you\nlike.” He and his soldiers departed, leaving the unfortunate conscripts.\nSome wore decent clothing; they’d be recently caught criminals. The rest\nhad slave brands on their foreheads. Seeing them brought back feelings that\nKaladin had to force down. He still stood on the very top of a steep slope;\none wrong step could send him tumbling back down into that despair.\n“In a line, you cremlings,” Gaz snapped at the new recruits, pulling\nfree his cudgel and waving it. He eyed Kaladin, but said nothing.\nThe group of men hastily lined up.\nGaz counted down the line, picking out the taller members. “You five\nmen, you’re in Bridge Six. Remember that. Forget it, and I’ll see you get a\nwhipping.” He counted off another group. “You six men, you’re in Bridge\nFourteen. You four at the end, Bridge Three. You, you, and you, Bridge\nOne. Bridge Two doesn’t need any…You four, Bridge Seven.”\nThat was all of them.\n“Gaz,” Kaladin said, folding his arms. Syl landed on his shoulder, her\nsmall tempest of leaves forming into a young woman.\nGaz turned to him.\n“Bridge Four is down to thirty fighting members.”"

And Bridge One is at thirty-seven, and you sent them\nthree new men.”\n“You barely lost anyone on the last run, and—”\nKaladin caught Gaz’s arm as the sergeant tried to walk away. Gaz\nflinched, lifting his cudgel.\nTry it, Kaladin thought, meeting Gaz’s eyes. He almost wished that the\nsergeant would.\nGaz gritted his teeth. “Fine. One man.”\n“I pick him,” Kaladin said.\n“Whatever. They’re all worthless anyway.”\nKaladin turned to the group of new bridgemen. They’d gathered into\nclusters by which bridge crew Gaz had put them in. Kaladin immediately\nturned his attention to the taller men. By slave standards, they appeared\nwell fed. Two of them looked like they’d—\n“Hey, gancho!” a voice said from another group. “Hey! You want me, I\nthink.”\nKaladin turned. A short, spindly man was waving to him. The man had\nonly one arm. Who would assign him to be a bridgeman?\nHe’d stop an arrow, Kaladin thought. That’s all some bridgemen are\ngood for, in the eyes of the uppers.\nThe man had brown hair and deep tan skin just a shade too dark to be\nAlethi. The fingernails on his hand were slate-colored and crystalline—he\nwas a Herdazian, then. Most of the newcomers shared the same defeated\nlook of apathy but this man was smiling, though he wore a slave’s mark on\nhis head.\nThat mark is old, Kaladin thought. Either he had a kind master before\nthis, or he has somehow resisted being beaten down. The man obviously\ndidn’t understand what awaited him as a bridgeman. No person would smile\nif they understood that.\n“You can use me,” the man said. “We Herdazians are great fighters,\ngon.” He pronounced that last word like “gone” and it appeared to refer to\nKaladin. “You see, this one time, I was with, sure, three men and they were\ndrunk and all but I still beat them.” He spoke at a very quick pace, his thick\naccent slurring the words together.\nHe’d make a terrible bridgeman. He might be able to run with the\nbridge on his shoulders, but not maneuver it. He even looked a little flabby\naround the waist. Whatever bridge crew got him would put him right in the\nfront and let him take an arrow, then be rid of him.\nGotta do what you can to stay alive, a voice from his past seemed to\nwhisper. Turn a liability into an advantage….\nTien.\n“Very well,” Kaladin said, pointing. “I’ll take the Herdazian at the\nback.”\n“What?” Gaz said.\nThe short man sauntered up to Kaladin. “Thanks, gancho! You’ll be\nglad you picked me.”\nKaladin turned to walk back, passing Gaz. The bridge sergeant\nscratched his head. “You pushed me that hard so you could pick the one-\narmed runt?”"

Instead, he turned to the\none-armed Herdazian. “Why did you want to come with me? You don’t\nknow anything about the different bridge crews.”\n“You were only picking one,” the man said. “That means one man gets\nto be special, the others don’t. I’ve got a good feeling about you. It’s in your\neyes, gancho.” He paused. “What’s a bridge crew?”\nKaladin found himself smiling at the man’s nonchalant attitude.\n“You’ll see. What’s your name?”\n“Lopen,” the man said. “Some of my cousins, they call me the Lopen\nbecause they haven’t ever heard anyone else named that. I’ve asked around\na lot, maybe one hundred…or two hundred…lots of people, sure. And\nnobody has heard of that name.”\nKaladin blinked at the torrent of words. Did the man ever stop to\nbreathe?\nBridge Four was taking their break, their massive bridge resting on one\nside and giving shade. The five wounded had joined them and were\nchatting; even Leyten was up, which was encouraging. He’d been having a\nlot of trouble walking, what with that crushed leg. Kaladin had done what\nhe could, but the man would always have a limp.\nThe only one who didn’t talk to the others was Dabbid, the man who\nhad been so profoundly shocked by battle. He followed the others, but he\ndidn’t talk. Kaladin was starting to fear that the man would never recover\nfrom his mind fatigue.\nHobber—the round-faced, gap-toothed man who had taken an arrow to\nthe leg—was walking without a crutch. It wouldn’t be long before he could\nstart running bridges again, and a good thing, too. They needed every pair\nof hands they could get.\n“Head to the barrack there,” Kaladin said to Lopen. “There’s a blanket,\nsandals, and vest for you in the pile at the very back.”\n“Sure,” Lopen said, sauntering off. He waved at a few of the men as he\npassed.\nRock walked up to Kaladin, folding his arms. “Is new member?”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said.\n“The only kind Gaz would give us, I assume.” Rock sighed. “This\nthing, we should have expected it. He will give us only the very most\nuseless of bridgemen from now on.”\nKaladin was tempted to say something in the way of agreement, but\nhesitated. Syl would probably see it as a lie, and that would annoy her.\n“This new way of carrying the bridge,” Rock said. “Is not very useful,\nI think. Is—”\nHe cut off as a horn call blared over the camp, echoing against stone\nbuildings like the bleat of a distant greatshell. Kaladin grew tense. His men\nwere on duty. He waited, tense, until the third set of horns blew.\n“Line up!” Kaladin yelled. “Let’s move!”\nUnlike the other nineteen crews on duty, Kaladin’s men didn’t"

He waited, tense, until the third set of horns blew.\n“Line up!” Kaladin yelled. “Let’s move!”\nUnlike the other nineteen crews on duty, Kaladin’s men didn’t\nscramble about in confusion, but assembled in an orderly fashion. Lopen\ndashed out, wearing a vest, then hesitated, looking at the four squads, not\nknowing where to go. He’d be cut to ribbons if Kaladin put him in front, but\nhe’d probably just slow them down anywhere else.\n“Lopen!” Kaladin shouted.\nThe one-armed man saluted. Does he think he’s actually in the\nmilitary?\n“You see that rain barrel? Go get some waterskins from the carpenter’s\nassistants. They told me we could borrow some. Fill as many as you can,\nthen catch up down below.”\n“Sure, gancho,” Lopen said.\n“Bridge up!” Kaladin shouted, moving into position at the front.\n“Shoulder carry!”\nBridge Four moved. While some of the other bridge crews were\ncrowded around their barracks, Kaladin’s team charged across the\nlumberyard. They were first down the incline, and reached the first\npermanent bridge before the army even formed up. There, Kaladin ordered\nthem to put their bridge down and wait.\nShortly thereafter, Lopen trotted down the hillside—and, surprisingly,\nDabbid and Hobber were with him. They couldn’t move fast, not with\nHobber’s limp, but they had constructed a sort of litter with a tarp and two\nlengths of wood. Piled into the middle of it were a good twenty waterskins.\nThey trotted up to the bridge team.\n“What’s this?” Kaladin said.\n“You told me to bring whatever I could carry, gon,” Lopen said. “Well,\nwe got this thing from the carpenters. They use it to carry pieces of wood,\nthey said, and they weren’t using it so we took it and now we’re here. Ain’t\nthat right, moolie?” He said that last to Dabbid, who just nodded.\n“Moolie?” Kaladin asked.\n“Means mute,” Lopen said, shrugging. “’Cuz he doesn’t seem to talk\nmuch, you see.”\n“I see. Well, good job. Bridge Four, back in position. Here comes the\nrest of the army.”\nThe next few hours were what they had grown to expect from bridge\nruns. Grueling conditions, carrying the heavy bridge across plateaus. The\nwater proved a huge help. The army occasionally watered the bridgemen\nduring runs, but never as often as the men needed it. Being able to take a\ndrink after crossing each plateau was as good as having a half-dozen more\nmen.\nBut the real difference came from the practice. Bridge Four’s men no\nlonger fell exhausted each time they set a bridge down. The work was still\ndifficult, but their bodies were ready for it. Kaladin caught more than a few\nglances of surprise or envy from the other bridge crews as his men laughed\nand joked instead of collapsing. Running a bridge once a week or so—as\nthe other men did—just wasn’t enough. An extra meal each night combined\nwith training had built up his men’s muscles and prepared them to work."

An extra meal each night combined\nwith training had built up his men’s muscles and prepared them to work.\nThe march was a long one, as long as Kaladin had ever made. They\ntraveled eastward for hours. That was a bad sign. When they aimed for\ncloser plateaus, they often got there before the Parshendi. But this far out\nthey were racing just to prevent the Parshendi from escaping with the\ngemheart; there was no chance they’d arrive before the enemy.\nThat meant it would probably be a difficult approach. We’re not ready\nfor the side carry, Kaladin thought nervously, as they finally drew close to\nan enormous plateau rising in an unusual shape. He’d heard of it—the\nTower, it was called. No Alethi force had ever won a gemheart here.\nThey set their bridge down before the penultimate chasm, positioning\nit, and Kaladin felt a foreboding as the scouts crossed. The Tower was\nwedge-shaped, uneven, with the southeastern point rising far into the air,\ncreating a steep hillside. Sadeas had brought a large number of soldiers; this\nplateau was enormous, allowing the deployment of a larger force. Kaladin\nwaited, anxious. Maybe they’d be lucky, and the Parshendi would already\nbe gone with the gemheart. It was possible, this far out.\nThe scouts came charging back. “Enemy lines on the opposing rim!\nThey haven’t gotten the chrysalis open yet!”\nKaladin groaned softly. The army began to cross on his bridge, and\nBridge Four regarded him, solemn, expressions grim. They knew what\nwould come next. Some of them, perhaps many of them, would not survive.\nIt was going to be very bad this time. On previous runs, they’d had a\nbuff er. When they’d lost four or five men, they’d still been able to keep\ngoing. Now they were running with just thirty members. Every man they\nlost would slow them measurably, and the loss of just four or five more\nwould cause them to wobble, or even topple. When that happened, the\nParshendi would focus everything on them. He’d seen it happen before. If a\nbridge crew started to teeter, the Parshendi pounced.\nBesides, when a bridge crew was visibly low on numbers, it always\ngot targeted by the Parshendi to be taken down. Bridge Four was in trouble.\nThis run could easily end with fifteen or twenty deaths. Something had to\nbe done.\nThis was it.\n“Gather close,” Kaladin said.\nThe men frowned, stepping up to him.\n“We’re going to carry the bridge in side position,” Kaladin said softly.\n“I’ll go first. I’m going to steer; be ready to go in the direction I do.”\n“Kaladin,” Teft said, “side position is slow. It was an interesting idea,\nbut—”\n“Do you trust me, Teft?” Kaladin asked.\n“Well, I guess.” The grizzled man glanced at the others. Kaladin could\nsee that many of them did not, at least not fully.\n“This will work,” Kaladin said intently. “We’re going to use the bridge"

We need to hurry out in front, faster than the\nother bridges. It’ll be hard to outrun them with the side carry, but it’s the\nonly thing I can think of. If it doesn’t work, I’ll be in front, so I’ll be the\nfirst to drop. If I die, move the bridge to shoulder-carry. We’ve practiced\ndoing that. Then you’ll be rid of me.”\nThe bridgemen were silent.\n“What if we don’t want to be rid of you?” long-faced Natam asked.\nKaladin smiled. “Then run swiftly and follow my lead. I’m going to\nturn us unexpectedly during the run; be ready to change directions.”\nHe went back to the bridge. The common soldiers were across, and the\nlighteyes—including Sadeas in his ornate Shardplate—were riding over the\nspan. Kaladin and Bridge Four followed, then pulled the bridge behind\nthem. They shoulder-carried it to the front of the army and put it down,\nwaiting for the other bridges to get in place. Lopen and the other two water-\ncarriers hung back with Gaz; it looked like they wouldn’t get into trouble\nfor not running. That was a small blessing.\nKaladin felt sweat bead on his forehead. He could just barely make out\nthe Parshendi ranks ahead, on the other side of the chasm. Men of black and\ncrimson, shortbows held at the ready, arrows nocked. The enormous slope\nof the Tower rose behind them.\nKaladin’s heart beat faster. Anticipationspren sprung up around\nmembers of the army, but not his team. To their credit, there weren’t any\nfearspren either—not that they didn’t feel fear, they just weren’t as panicked\nas the other bridge crews, so the fearspren went there instead.\nCare, Tukks seemed to whisper at him from the past. The key to\nfighting isn’t lack of passion, it’s controlled passion. Care about winning.\nCare about those you defend. You have to care about something.\nI care, Kaladin thought. Storm me as a fool, but I do.\n“Bridges up!” Gaz’s voice echoed across the front lines, repeating the\norder given him by Lamaril.\nBridge Four moved, quickly turning the bridge on its side and hoisting\nit up. The shorter men made a line, holding the bridge up to their right, with\nthe taller men forming a bunched-up line behind them, reaching through\nand lifting or reaching high and steadying the bridge. Lamaril gave them a\nharsh look, and Kaladin’s breath caught in his throat.\nGaz stepped up and whispered something to Lamaril. The nobleman\nnodded slowly, and said nothing. The assault call sounded.\nBridge Four charged.\nFrom behind them, arrows flew in a wave over the bridge crews’\nheads, arcing down toward the Parshendi. Kaladin ran, jaw clenched. He\nhad trouble keeping himself from stumbling over the rockbuds and\nshalebark growths.

With Kaladin at their lead, Bridge Four managed to get out ahead of\nthe others.\nThat was important, because Kaladin angled his team slightly to the\nright, as if his crew were just a tad off-course with the heavy bridge at the\nside. The Parshendi knelt down and began to chant together. Alethi arrows\nfell among them, distracting some, but the others raised bows.\nGet ready… Kaladin thought. He pushed harder, and felt a sudden\nsurge of strength. His legs stopped straining, his breath stopped wheezing.\nPerhaps it was the anxiety of battle, perhaps it was numbness setting in, but\nthe unexpected strength gave him a slight sense of euphoria. He felt as if\nsomething were buzzing within him, mixing with his blood.\nIn that moment it felt like he was pulling the bridge behind him all\nalone, like a sail towing the ship beneath it. He turned farther to the right,\nrunning at a deeper angle, putting himself and his men in full sight of the\nParshendi archers.\nThe Parshendi continued to chant, somehow knowing—without orders\n—when to draw their bows. They pulled arrows to marbled cheeks, sighting\non the bridgemen. As expected, many aimed at his men.\nAlmost close enough!\nJust a few heartbeats more…\nNow!\nKaladin turned sharply to the left just as the Parshendi loosed. The\nbridge moved with him, now charging with the face of the bridge pointed\ntoward the archers. Arrows flew, snapping against the wood, digging into it.\nSome arrows rattled against the stone beneath their feet. The bridge\nresounded with the impacts.\nKaladin heard desperate screams of pain from the other bridge crews.\nMen fell, some of them probably on their first run. In Bridge Four, nobody\ncried out. Nobody fell.\nKaladin turned the bridge again, running angled in the other direction,\nthe bridgemen exposed again. The surprised Parshendi nocked arrows.\nNormally, they fired in waves. That gave Kaladin an opportunity, for as\nsoon as the Parshendi got the arrows drawn, he turned, using the bulky\nbridge as a shield.\nAgain, arrows snapped into the wood. Again, other bridge crews\nscreamed. Again, Kaladin’s zigzagging run protected his men.\nOne more, Kaladin thought. This would be the tough one. The\nParshendi would know what he was doing. They’d be ready to fire once he\nturned back.\nHe turned.\nNobody fired.\nAmazed, he realized that the Parshendi archers had turned all of their\nattention to the other bridge crews, seeking easier targets. The space in front\nof Bridge Four was virtually empty.\nThe chasm was near, and—despite his angling—Kaladin brought his\nteam in on-mark to place their bridge in the right spot. They all had to be\naligned close together for cavalry charge to work. Kaladin quickly gave the\norder to drop. Some of the Parshendi archers turned their attention back, but\nmost ignored them, firing their arrows at the other crews.\nA crash from behind announced a bridge falling. Kaladin and his men"

Some of the Parshendi archers turned their attention back, but\nmost ignored them, firing their arrows at the other crews.\nA crash from behind announced a bridge falling. Kaladin and his men\npushed, the Alethi archers behind pelting the Parshendi to distract them and\nkeep them from shoving the bridge back. Still pushing, Kaladin risked a\nglance over his shoulder.\nThe next bridge in line was close. It was Bridge Seven, but they were\nfloundering, arrow after arrow striking them, cutting them down in rows.\nThey fell as he watched, bridge crashing to the stones. Now Bridge Twenty-\nseven was wavering. Two other bridges were already down. Bridge Six had\nreached the chasm, but just barely, over half its members down. Where\nwere the other bridge crews? He couldn’t tell from his quick glance, and\nhad to turn back to his work.\nKaladin’s men placed their bridge with a thump, and Kaladin gave the\ncall to pull back. He and his men dashed away to let the cavalry charge\nacross. But no cavalry came. Sweat dripping from his brow, Kaladin spun.\nFive other bridge crews had set their bridges, but others were still\nstruggling to reach the chasm. Unexpectedly, they’d tried tilting their\nbridges to block the arrows, emulating Kaladin and his team. Many\nstumbled, some men attempting to lower the bridge for protection while\nothers still ran forward.\nIt was chaos. These men hadn’t practiced the side carry. As one\nstraggling crew tried to hold their bridge up in the new position, they\ndropped it. Two more bridge crews were cut down completely by the\nParshendi, who continued to fire.\nHeavy cavalry charged, crossing the six bridges that had been set.\nNormally, two riders abreast on each bridge added up to a mass of a\nhundred horsemen, thirty to forty across and three ranks deep. That\ndepended on many bridges aligned in a row, allowing an effective charge\nagainst the hundreds of Parshendi archers.\nBut the bridges had been set too erratically. Some cavalry got across,\nbut they were scattered, and couldn’t ride down the Parshendi without fear\nof being surrounded.\nFoot soldiers had started to help push Bridge Six into place. We should\ngo help, Kaladin realized. Get those other bridges across.\nBut it was too late. Though Kaladin stood near the battlefield, his men\n—as was their practice—had fallen back to the nearest rock outcropping for\nshelter. The one they’d chosen was close enough to see the battle, but was\nwell protected from arrows. The Parshendi always ignored bridgemen after\nthe initial assault, though the Alethi were careful to leave rear guards to\nprotect the landing point and watch for Parshendi trying to cut off their\nretreat.\nThe soldiers finally maneuvered Bridge Six into place, and two more\nbridge crews got theirs down, but half of the bridges hadn’t made it. The\narmy had to reorganize on the run, dashing forward to support the cavalry,\nsplitting to cross where the bridges had been set.\nTeft left the outcropping and grabbed Kaladin by the arm, tugging him\nback to relative safety. Kaladin allowed himself to be pulled along, but he\nstill looked at the battlefield, a horrible realization coming to him."

Kaladin allowed himself to be pulled along, but he\nstill looked at the battlefield, a horrible realization coming to him.\nRock stepped up beside Kaladin, clapping him on the shoulder. The\nlarge Horneater’s hair was plastered to his head with sweat, but he was\nsmiling broadly. “Is miracle! Not a single man wounded!”\nMoash stepped up beside them. “Stormfather! I can’t believe what we\njust did. Kaladin, you’ve changed bridge runs forever!”\n“No,” Kaladin said softly. “I’ve completely undermined our assault.”\n“I—What?”\nStormfather! Kaladin thought. The heavy cavalry had been cut off. A\ncavalry charge needed an unbroken line; it was the intimidation as much as\nanything that made it work.\nBut here, the Parshendi could dodge out of the way, then come at the\nhorsemen from the flanks. And the foot soldiers hadn’t gotten in quickly\nenough to help. Several groups of horsemen fought completely surrounded.\nSoldiers bunched up around the bridges that had been set, trying to get\nacross, but the Parshendi had a solid foothold and were repelling them.\nSpearmen fell from the bridges, and the Parshendi then managed to topple\none entire bridge into the chasm. The Alethi forces were soon on the\ndefensive, the soldiers focused on holding the bridgeheads to secure an\navenue of retreat for the cavalry.\nKaladin watched, really watched. He’d never studied the tactics and\nneeds of the entire army in these assaults. He’d considered only the needs\nof his own crew. It was a foolish mistake, and he should have known better.\nHe would have known better, if he’d still thought of himself as a real\nsoldier. He hated Sadeas; he hated the way the man used bridge crews. But\nhe shouldn’t have changed Bridge Four’s basic tactics without considering\nthe larger scheme of the battle.\nI deflected attention to the other bridge crews, Kaladin thought. That\ngot us to the chasm too soon, and slowed some of the others.\nAnd, since he’d run out in front, many other bridgemen had gotten a\ngood view of how he’d used the bridge as a shield. That had led them to\nemulate Bridge Four. Each of the crews had ended up running at a different\nspeed, and the Alethi archers hadn’t known where to focus their volleys to\nsoften the Parshendi for the bridge landings.\nStormfather! I’ve just cost Sadeas this battle.\nThere would be repercussions. The bridgemen had been forgotten\nwhile the generals and captains scrambled to revise their battle plans. But\nonce this was over, they would come for him.\nOr maybe it would happen sooner. Gaz and Lamaril, with a group of\nreserve spearmen, were marching toward Bridge Four.\nRock stepped up beside Kaladin on one side, a nervous Teft on the\nother, holding a stone in his hands. The bridgemen behind Kaladin began to\nmutter.\n“Stand down,” Kaladin said softly to Rock and Teft.\n“But, Kaladin!” Teft said. “They—”\n“Stand down. Gather the bridgemen.

Get them back to the lumberyard\nsafely, if you can.” If any of us escape this disaster.\nWhen Rock and Teft didn’t back away, Kaladin stepped forward. The\nbattle still raged on the Tower; Sadeas’s group—led by the Shardbearer\nhimself—had managed to claim a small section of ground and were holding\nit doggedly. Corpses piled up on both sides. It wouldn’t be enough.\nRock and Teft moved up beside Kaladin again, but he stared them\ndown, forcing them back. Then he turned to Gaz and Lamaril. I’ll point out\nthat Gaz told me to do this, he thought. He suggested I use a side carry on a\nbridge assault.\nBut no. There were no witnesses. It would be his word against Gaz’s.\nThat wouldn’t work—plus, that argument would leave Gaz and Lamaril\nwith good reason to see Kaladin dead immediately, before he could speak to\ntheir superiors.\nKaladin needed to do something else.\n“Do you have any idea what you’ve done?” Gaz sputtered as he grew\nnear.\n“I’ve upended the army’s strategy,” Kaladin said, “throwing the entire\nassault force into chaos. You’ve come to punish me so that when your\nsuperiors come screaming to you for what happened, you can at least show\nthat you acted quickly to deal with the one responsible.”\nGaz paused, Lamaril and the spearmen stopping around him. The\nbridge sergeant looked surprised.\n“If it’s worth anything,” Kaladin said grimly, “I didn’t know this\nwould happen. I was just trying to survive.”\n“Bridgemen aren’t supposed to survive,” Lamaril said curtly. He\nwaved to a pair of his soldiers, then pointed at Kaladin.\n“If you leave me alive,” Kaladin said, “I promise I will tell your\nsuperiors that you had nothing to do with this. If you kill me, it will look\nlike you were trying to hide something.”\n“Hide something?” Gaz said, glancing at the battle on the Tower. A\nstray arrow clattered across the rocks a short distance from him, shaft\nbreaking. “What would we have to hide?”\n“Depends. This very well could look like it was your idea from the\nstart. Brightlord Lamaril, you didn’t stop me. You could have, but you\ndidn’t, and soldiers saw Gaz and you speaking when you saw what I did. If\nI can’t vouch for your ignorance of what I was going to do, then you’ll look\nvery, very bad.”\nLamaril’s soldiers looked to their leader. The lighteyed man scowled.\n“Beat him,” he said, “but don’t kill him.” He turned and marched back\ntoward the Alethi reserve lines.\nThe beefy spearmen walked up to Kaladin. They were darkeyed, but\nthey might as well have been Parshendi for all the sympathy they would\nshow him. Kaladin closed his eyes and steeled himself. He couldn’t fight\nthem all off.

Not and remain with Bridge Four.\nA spear butt to the gut knocked him to the ground, and he gasped as\nthe soldiers began to kick. One booted foot tore open his belt pouch. His\nspheres—too precious to leave in the barrack—scattered across the stones.\nThey had somehow lost their Stormlight, and were now dun, their life run\nout.\nThe soldiers kept kicking.\n“They changed, even as we fought them. Like shadows they were, that\ncan transform as the flame dances. Never underestimate them because\nof what you first see.”\n—Purports to be a scrap collected from Talatin, a Radiant of the Order\nof Stonewards. The source—Guvlow’s Incarnate—is generally held as\nreliable, though this is from a copied fragment of “The Poem of the\nSeventh Morning,” which has been lost.\nSometimes, when Shallan walked into the Palanaeum proper—the grand\nstorehouse of books, manuscripts, and scrolls beyond the study areas of the\nVeil—she grew so distracted by the beauty and scope of it that she forgot\neverything else.\nThe Palanaeum was shaped like an inverted pyramid carved down into\nthe rock. It had balcony walkways suspended around its perimeter. Slanted\ngently downward, they ran around all four walls to form a majestic square\nspiral, a giant staircase pointing toward the center of Roshar. A series of lifts\nprovided a quicker method of descending.\nStanding at the top level’s railing, Shallan could see only halfway to\nthe bottom. This place seemed too large, too grand, to have been shaped by\nthe hands of men. How had the terraced levels been aligned so perfectly?\nHad Soulcasters been used to create the open spaces? How many gemstones\nwould that have taken?\nThe lighting was dim; there was no general illumination, only small\nemerald lamps focused to illuminate the walkway floors. Ardents from the\nDevotary of Insight periodically moved through the levels, changing the\nspheres. There had to be hundreds upon hundreds of the emeralds here;\napparently, they made up the Kharbranthian royal treasury. What better\nplace for them than the extremely secure Palanaeum? Here they could both\nbe protected and serve to illuminate the enormous library.\nShallan continued on her way. Her parshman servant carried a sphere\nlantern containing a trio of sapphire marks. The soft blue light reflected\nagainst the stone walls, portions of which had been Soulcast into quartz\npurely for ornamentation. The railings had been carved from wood, then\ntransformed to marble. When she ran her fingers across one, she could feel\nthe original wood’s grain. At the same time, it had the cold smoothness of\nstone. An oddity that seemed designed to confuse the senses.\nHer parshman carried a small basket of books full of drawings by\nfamous natural scientists. Jasnah had begun allowing Shallan to spend some\nof her study time on topics of her own choosing. Just a single hour a day,\nbut it was remarkable how precious that hour had become.

She hungered to learn more, wished\nto observe each and every one of its creatures, to have sketches of them in\nher books. To organize Roshar by capturing it in images. The books she\nread, though wonderful, all felt incomplete. Each author would be good\nwith words or with drawings, but rarely both. And if the author was good\nwith both, then her grasp of science would be poor.\nThere were so many holes in their understanding. Holes that Shallan\ncould fill.\nNo, she told herself firmly as she walked. That’s not what I’m here to\ndo.\nIt was getting harder and harder to stay focused on the theft, though\nJasnah—as Shallan had hoped—had begun using her as a bathing attendant.\nThat might soon present the opportunity she needed. And yet, the more she\nstudied, the more she hungered for knowledge.\nShe led her parshman to one of the lifts. There, two other parshmen\nbegan lowering her. Shallan eyed the basket of books. She could spend her\ntime on the lift reading, maybe finish that section of Western Voyages…\nShe turned away from the basket. Stay focused. On the fifth level\ndown, she stepped out into the smaller walkway that connected the lift to\nthe sloping ramps set into the walls. Upon reaching the wall, she turned\nright and continued down a little farther. The wall was lined with doorways\nand, finding the one she wanted, she entered a large stone chamber filled\nwith tall bookshelves. “Wait here,” she said to her parshman as she dug her\ndrawing folio out of the basket. She tucked it under her arm, took the\nlantern, and hurried into the stacks.\nOne could disappear for hours in the Palanaeum and never see another\nsoul. Shallan rarely saw anyone while searching out an obscure book for\nJasnah. There were ardents and servants to fetch volumes, of course, but\nJasnah thought it important for Shallan to practice doing it herself.\nApparently the Kharbranthian filing system was now standard for many of\nRoshar’s libraries and archives.\nAt the back of the room, she found a small desk of cobwood. She set\nher lantern on one side and sat on the stool, getting out her portfolio. The\nroom was silent and dark, her lantern light revealing the ends of\nbookshelves to her right and a smooth stone wall to her left. The air smelled\nof old paper and dust. Not wet. It was never damp in the Palanaeum.\nPerhaps the dryness had something to do with the long troughs of white\npowder at the ends of each room.\nShe undid her portfolio’s leather ties. Inside, the top sheets were blank,\nand the next few contained drawings she’d done of people in the\nPalanaeum. More faces for her collection. Hidden in the middle was a far\nmore important set of drawings: sketches of Jasnah performing\nSoulcastings.\nThe princess used her Soulcaster infrequently; perhaps she hesitated to\nuse it when Shallan was around. But Shallan had caught a handful of\noccasions, mostly when Jasnah had been distracted, and had apparently\nforgotten she wasn’t alone."

        "text": "use it when Shallan was around. But Shallan had caught a handful of\noccasions, mostly when Jasnah had been distracted, and had apparently\nforgotten she wasn’t alone.\nShallan held up one picture. Jasnah, sitting in the alcove, hand to the\nside and touching a crumpled piece of notepaper, a gem on her Soulcaster\nglowing. Shallan held up the next picture. It depicted the same scene just\nseconds later. The paper had become a ball of flames. It hadn’t burned. No,\nit had become fire. Tongues of flame coiling, a flash of heat in the air. What\nhad been on it that Jasnah wished to hide?\nAnother picture showed Jasnah Soulcasting the wine in her cup into a\nchunk of crystal to use as a paperweight, the goblet itself holding down\nanother stack, on one of the rare occasions when they’d dined—and studied\n—on a patio outside the Conclave. There was also the one of Jasnah\nburning words after running out of ink. When Shallan had seen her burning\nletters into a page, she’d been amazed at the Soulcaster’s precision.\nIt seemed that this Soulcaster was attuned to three Essences in\nparticular: Vapor, Spark, and Lucentia. But it should be able to create any of\nthe Ten Essences, from Zephyr to Talus. That last one was the most\nimportant to Shallan, as Talus included stone and earth. She could create\nnew mineral deposits for her family to exploit. It would work; Soulcasters\nwere very rare in Jah Keved, and her family’s marble, jade, and opal would\nsell at a premium. They couldn’t create actual gemstones with a Soulcaster\n—that was said to be impossible—but they could create other deposits of\nnear equal value.\nOnce those new deposits ran out, they’d have to move to less lucrative\ntrades. That would be all right, though. By then, they’d have paid off their\ndebts and compensated those to whom promises had been broken. House\nDavar would become unimportant again, but would not collapse.\nShallan studied the pictures again. The Alethi princess seemed\nremarkably casual about Soulcasting. She held one of the most powerful\nartifacts in all of Roshar, and she used it to create paperweights? What else\ndid she use the Soulcaster for, when Shallan wasn’t watching? Jasnah\nseemed to use it less frequently in her presence now than she had at first.\nShallan fished in the safepouch inside her sleeve, bringing out her\nfather’s broken Soulcaster. It had been sheared in two places: across one of\nthe chains and through the setting that held one of the stones. She inspected\nit in the light, looking—not for the first time—for signs of that damage. The\nlink in the chain had been replaced perfectly and the setting reforged\nequally well. Even knowing exactly where the cuts had been, she couldn’t\nfind any flaw. Unfortunately, repairing only the outward defects hadn’t\nmade it functional.\nShe hefted the heavy construction of metal and chains. Then she put it\non, looping chains around her thumb, small finger, and middle finger. There\nwere no gemstones in the device at present. She compared the broken"

There\nwere no gemstones in the device at present. She compared the broken\nSoulcaster to the drawings, inspecting it from all sides. Yes, it looked\nidentical. She’d worried about that.\nShallan felt her heart flutter as she regarded the broken Soulcaster.\nStealing from Jasnah had seemed acceptable when the princess had been a\ndistant, unknown figure. A heretic, presumably ill-tempered and demanding.\nBut what of the real Jasnah? A careful scholar, stern but fair, with a\nsurprising level of wisdom and insight? Could Shallan really steal from her?\nShe tried to still her heart. Even as a little child, she’d been this way.\nShe could remember her tears at fights between her parents. She was not\ngood with confrontation.\nBut she’d do it. For Nan Balat, Tet Wikim, and Asha Jushu. Her\nbrothers depended on her. She pressed her hands against her thighs to keep\nthem from shaking, breathing in and out. After a few minutes, nerves under\ncontrol, she took off the damaged Soulcaster and returned it to her\nsafepouch. She gathered up her papers. They might be important in\ndiscovering how to use the Soulcaster. What was she going to do about\nthat? Was there a way to ask Jasnah about using a Soulcaster without\narousing suspicion?\nA light flickering through nearby bookcases startled her, and she\ntucked away her folio. It turned out to be just an old, berobed female ardent,\nshuffling with a lantern and followed by a parshman servant. She didn’t\nlook in Shallan’s direction as she turned between two rows of shelves, her\nlantern’s light shining out through the spaces between the books. Lit that\nway—with her figure hidden but the light streaming between the shelves—\nit looked as if one of the Heralds themselves were walking through the\nstacks.\nHer heart racing again, Shallan raised her safehand to her breast. I\nmake a terrible thief, she thought with a grimace. She finished gathering her\nthings and moved through the stacks, lantern held before her. The head of\neach row was carved with symbols, indicating the date the books had\nentered the Palanaeum. That was how they were organized. There were\nenormous cabinets filled with indexes on the top level.\nJasnah had sent Shallan to fetch—and then read—a copy of Dialogues,\na famous historical work on political theory. However, this was also the\nroom that contained Shadows Remembered—the book Jasnah was reading\nwhen the king had visited. Shallan had later looked it up in the index. It\nmight have been reshelved by now.\nSuddenly curious, Shallan counted off the rows. She stepped in and\ncounted shelves inward. Near the middle and at the bottom, she found a thin\nred volume with a red hogshide cover. Shadows Remembered. Shallan set\nher lantern on the ground and slipped the book free, feeling furtive as she\nflipped through the pages.\nShe was confused by what she discovered.

There was no undertext commentary, just a\ncollection of tales. Shallan sat down on the floor, reading through the first\none. It was the story of a child who wandered away from his home at night\nand was chased by Voidbringers until he hid in a cavern beside a lake. He\nwhittled a piece of wood into a roughly human shape and sent it floating\nacross the lake, fooling the creatures into attacking and eating it instead.\nShallan didn’t have much time—Jasnah would grow suspicious if she\nremained down here too long—but she skimmed the rest of the stories.\nThey were all of a similar style, ghost stories about spirits or Voidbringers.\nThe only commentary was at the back, explaining that the author had been\ncurious about the folktales told by common darkeyes. She had spent years\ncollecting and recording them.\nShadows Remembered, Shallan thought, would have been better off\nforgotten.\nThis was what Jasnah had been reading? Shallan had expected\nShadows Remembered to be some kind of deep philosophical discussion of\na hidden historical murder. Jasnah was a Veristitalian. She constructed the\ntruth of what happened in the past. What kind of truth could she find in\nstories told to frighten disobedient darkeyed children?\nShallan slid the volume back in place and hurried on her way.\nA short time later, Shallan returned to the alcove to discover that her haste\nhad been unnecessary. Jasnah wasn’t there. Kabsal, however, was.\nThe youthful ardent sat at the long desk, flipping through one of\nShallan’s books on art. Shallan noticed him before he saw her, and she\nfound herself smiling despite her troubles. She folded her arms and adopted\na dubious expression. “Again?” she asked.\nKabsal leaped up, slapping the book closed. “Shallan,” he said, his\nbald head reflecting the blue light of her parshman’s lantern. “I came\nlooking for—”\n“For Jasnah,” Shallan said. “As always. And yet, she’s never here\nwhen you come.”\n“An unfortunate coincidence,” he said, raising a hand to his forehead.\n“I am a poor judge of timing, am I not?”\n“And is that a basket of bread at your feet?”\n“A gift for Brightness Jasnah,” he said. “From the Devotary of\nInsight.”\n“I doubt a bread basket is going to persuade her to renounce her\nheresy,” Shallan said. “Perhaps if you’d included jam.”\nThe ardent smiled, picking up the basket and pulling out a small jar of\nred simberry jam.\n“Of course, I’ve told you that Jasnah doesn’t like jam,” Shallan said\n“And yet you bring it anyway, knowing jam to be among my favorite foods.\nAnd you’ve done this oh…a dozen times in the last few months?”\n“I’m growing a bit transparent, aren’t I?”\n“Just a tad,” she said, smiling. “It’s about my soul, isn’t it? You’re\nworried about me because I’m apprenticed to a heretic.”\n“Er…well, yes, I’m afraid.”"

Was it true that there were parshmen on the Shattered Plains who\nwere fighting? That seemed hard to credit. She’d never known any\nparshman to as much as raise their voice. They didn’t seem bright enough\nfor disobedience.\nOf course, some reports she’d heard—including those Jasnah had\nmade her read when studying King Gavilar’s murder—indicated that the\nParshendi weren’t like other parshmen. They were bigger, had odd armor\nthat grew from their skin itself, and spoke far more frequently. Perhaps they\nweren’t parshmen at all, but some kind of distant cousin, a different race\nentirely.\nShe sat down at the desk as Kabsal got out the bread, her parshman\nwaiting at the doorway. A parshman wasn’t much of a chaperone, but\nKabsal was an ardent, which meant technically she didn’t need one.\nThe bread had been purchased from a Thaylen bakery, which meant it\nwas fluffy and brown. And, since he was an ardent, it didn’t matter that jam\nwas a feminine food—they could enjoy it together. She eyed him as he cut\nthe bread. The ardents in her father’s employ had all been crusty men or\nwomen in their later years, stern-eyed and impatient with children. She’d\nnever even considered that the devotaries would attract young men like\nKabsal.\nDuring these last few weeks, she’d found herself thinking of him in\nways that would better have been avoided.\n“Have you considered,” he noted, “what kind of person you declare\nyourself to be by preferring simberry jam?”\n“I wasn’t aware that my taste in jams could be that significant.”\n“There are those who have studied it,” Kabsal said, slathering on the\nthick red jam and handing her the slice. “You run across some very odd\nbooks, working in the Palanaeum. It’s not hard to conclude that perhaps\neverything has been studied at one time or another.”\n“Hum,” Shallan said. “And simberry jam?”\n“According to Palates of Personality—and before you object, yes it is\na real book, and that is its title—a fondness for simberries indicates a\nspontaneous, impulsive personality. And also a preference for—” He cut off\nas a wadded-up piece of paper bounced off his forehead. He blinked.\n“Sorry,” Shallan said. “It just kind of happened. Must be all that\nimpulsiveness and spontaneity I have.”\nHe smiled. “You disagree with the conclusions?”\n“I don’t know,” she said with a shrug. “I’ve had people tell me they\ncould determine my personality based on the day I was born, or the position\nof Taln’s Scar on my seventh birthday, or by numerological extrapolations\nof the tenth glyphic paradigm. But I think we’re more complicated than\nthat.”\n“People are more complicated than the numerological extrapolations\nof the tenth glyphic paradigm?” Kabsal said, spreading jam on a piece of"

But I think we’re more complicated than\nthat.”\n“People are more complicated than the numerological extrapolations\nof the tenth glyphic paradigm?” Kabsal said, spreading jam on a piece of\nbread for himself. “No wonder I have such difficulty understanding\nwomen.”\n“Very funny. I mean that we’re more complex than mere bundles of\npersonality traits. Am I spontaneous? Sometimes. You might describe my\nchasing Jasnah here to become her ward that way. But before that, I spent\nseventeen years being about as unspontaneous as someone could be. In\nmany situations—if I’m encouraged—my tongue can be quite spontaneous,\nbut my actions rarely are. We’re all spontaneous sometimes, and we’re all\nconservative sometimes.”\n“So you’re saying that the book is right then. It says you’re\nspontaneous; you’re spontaneous sometimes. Ergo, it’s correct.”\n“By that argument, it’s right about everybody.”\n“One hundred percent accurate!”\n“Well, not one hundred percent,” Shallan said, swallowing another bite\nof the sweet, fluffy bread. “As has been noted, Jasnah hates jam of all\nkinds.”\n“Ah yes,” Kabsal said. “She’s a jam heretic too. Her soul is in more\ndanger than I had realized.” He grinned and took a bite of his bread.\n“Indeed,” Shallan said. “So what else does that book of yours say\nabout me—and half the world’s population—because of our enjoyment of\nfoods with far too much sugar in them?”\n“Well, a fondness for simberry is also supposed to indicate a love of\nthe outdoors.”\n“Ah, the outdoors,” Shallan said. “I visited that mythical place once. It\nwas so very long ago, I’ve nearly forgotten it. Tell me, does the sun still\nshine, or is that just my dreamy recollection?”\n“Surely your studies aren’t that bad.”\n“Jasnah is inordinately fond of dust,” Shallan said. “I believe she\nthrives on it, feeding off the particles like a chull crunching rockbuds.”\n“And you, Shallan? On what do you thrive?”\n“Charcoal.”\nHe looked confused at first, then glanced at her folio. “Ah yes. I was\nsurprised at how quickly your name, and pictures, spread through the\nConclave.”\nShallan ate the last of her bread, then wiped her hands on a damp rag\nKabsal had brought. “You make me sound like a disease.” She ran a finger\nthrough her red hair, grimacing. “I guess I do have the coloring of a rash,\ndon’t I?”\n“Nonsense,” he said sternly. “You shouldn’t say such things,\nBrightness. It’s disrespectful.”\n“Of myself?”\n“No. Of the Almighty, who made you.”\n“He made cremlings too. Not to mentions rashes and diseases. So\nbeing compared to one is actually an honor.”\n“I fail to follow that logic, Brightness. As he created all things,\ncomparisons are meaningless.”\n“Like the claims of your Palates book, eh?”\n“A point.”\n“There are worse things to be than a disease,” she said, idly thoughtful.\n“When you have one, it reminds you that you’re alive.

When the disease has run its course, normal healthy life\nseems wonderful by comparison.”\n“And would you not rather be a sense of euphoria? Bringing pleasant\nfeelings and joy to those you infect?”\n“Euphoria passes. It is usually brief, so we spend more time longing\nfor it than enjoying it.” She sighed. “Look what we’ve done. Now I’m\ndepressed. At least turning back to my studies will seem exciting by\ncomparison.”\nHe frowned at the books. “I was under the impression that you enjoyed\nyour studies.”\n“As was I. Then Jasnah Kholin stomped into my life and proved that\neven something pleasant could become boring.”\n“I see. So she’s a harsh mistress?”\n“Actually, no,” Shallan said. “I’m just fond of hyperbole.”\n“I’m not,” he said. “It’s a real bastard to spell.”\n“Kabsal!”\n“Sorry,” he said. Then he glanced upward. “Sorry.”\n“I’m sure the ceiling forgives you. To get the Almighty’s attention, you\nmight want to burn a prayer instead.”\n“I owe him a few anyway,” Kabsal said. “You were saying?”\n“Well, Brightness Jasnah isn’t a harsh mistress. She’s actually\neverything she’s said to be. Brilliant, beautiful, mysterious. I’m fortunate to\nbe her ward.”\nKabsal nodded. “She is said to be a sterling woman, save for one\nthing.”\n“You mean the heresy?”\nHe nodded.\n“It’s not as bad for me as you think,” she said. “She’s rarely vocal\nabout her beliefs unless provoked.”\n“She’s ashamed, then.”\n“I doubt that. Merely considerate.”\nHe eyed her.\n“You needn’t worry about me,” Shallan said. “Jasnah doesn’t try to\npersuade me to abandon the devotaries.”\nKabsal leaned forward, growing more somber. He was older than she\n—a man in his mid-twenties, confident, self-assured, and earnest. He was\npractically the only man near her age that she’d ever talked to outside of her\nfather’s careful supervision.\nBut he was also an ardent. So, of course, nothing could come of it.\nCould it?\n“Shallan,” Kabsal said gently, “can you not see how we—how I—\nwould be concerned? Brightness Jasnah is a very powerful and intriguing\nwoman. We would expect her ideas to be infectious.”\n“Infectious? I thought you said I was the disease.”\n“I never said that!”\n“Yes, but I pretended you did. Which is virtually the same thing.”\nHe frowned. “Brightness Shallan, the ardents are worried about you.\nThe souls of the Almighty’s children are our responsibility. Jasnah has a\nhistory of corrupting those with whom she comes in contact.”\n“Really?” Shallan asked, genuinely interested. “Other wards?”\n“It is not my place to say.”\n“We can move to another place.”\n“I’m firm on this point, Brightness. I will not speak of it.”\n“Write it, then.”\n“Brightness…” he said, voice taking on a suffering tone."

She found herself\nstudying him again, but grew annoyed at her own girlish foolishness. She\nwould soon be returning to her family, and he was only visiting her for\nreasons relating to his Calling. But she truly was fond of his company. He\nwas the only one here in Kharbranth that she felt she could really talk to.\nAnd he was handsome; the simple clothing and shaved head only\nhighlighted his strong features. Like many young ardents, he kept his beard\nshort and neatly trimmed. He spoke with a refined voice, and he was so\nwell-read.\n“Well, if you’re certain about your soul,” he said, turning back to her.\n“Then perhaps I could interest you in our devotary.”\n“I have a devotary. The Devotary of Purity.”\n“But the Devotary of Purity isn’t the place for a scholar. The Glory it\nadvocates has nothing to do with your studies or your art.”\n“A person doesn’t need a devotary that focuses directly on their\nCalling.”\n“It is nice when the two coincide, though.”\nShallan stifled a grimace. The Devotary of Purity focused on—as one\nmight imagine—teaching one to emulate the Almighty’s honesty and\nwholesomeness. The ardents at the devotary hall hadn’t known what to\nmake of her fascination with art. They’d always wanted her to do sketches\nof things they found “pure.” Statues of the Heralds, depictions of the\nDouble Eye.\nHer father had chosen the devotary for her, of course.\n“I just wonder if you made an informed choice,” Kabsal said.\n“Switching devotaries is allowed, after all.”\n“Yes, but isn’t recruitment frowned upon? Ardents competing for\nmembers?”\n“It is indeed frowned upon. A deplorable habit.”\n“But you do it anyway?”\n“I curse occasionally too.”\n“I hadn’t noticed. You’re a very curious ardent, Kabsal.”\n“You’d be surprised. We’re not nearly as stuffy a bunch as we seem.\nWell, except Brother Habsant; he spends so much time staring at the rest of\nus.” He hesitated. “Actually, now I think about it, he might actually be\nstuffed. I don’t know that I’ve ever seen him move….”\n“We’re getting distracted. Weren’t you trying to recruit me to your\ndevotary?”\n“Yes. And it’s not so uncommon as you think. All of the devotaries\nengage in it. We do a lot of frowning at one another for our profound lack of\nethics.” He leaned forward again, growing more serious. “My devotary has\nrelatively few members, as we don’t have as much exposure as others. So\nwhenever someone seeking knowledge comes to the Palanaeum, we take it\nupon ourselves to inform them.”\n“Recruit them.”"

So\nwhenever someone seeking knowledge comes to the Palanaeum, we take it\nupon ourselves to inform them.”\n“Recruit them.”\n“Let them see what it is they are missing.” He took a bite of his bread\nand jam. “In the Devotary of Purity, did they teach you about the nature of\nthe Almighty? The divine prism, with the ten facets representing the\nHeralds?”\n“They touched on it,” she said. “Mostly we talked about achieving my\ngoals of…well, purity. Somewhat boring, I’ll admit, since there wasn’t\nmuch chance for impurity on my part.”\nKabsal shook his head. “The Almighty gives everyone talents—and\nwhen we pick a Calling that capitalizes on them, we are worshipping him\nin the most fundamental way. A devotary—and its ardents—should help\nnurture that, encouraging you to set and achieve goals of excellence.” He\nwaved to the books stacked on the desk. “This is what your devotary should\nbe helping you with, Shallan. History, logic, science, art. Being honest and\ngood is important, but we should be working harder to encourage the\nnatural talents of people, rather than forcing them to adapt to the Glories\nand Callings we feel are most important.”\n“That is a reasonable argument, I guess.”\nKabsal nodded, looking thoughtful “Is it any wonder a woman like\nJasnah Kholin turned away from that? Many devotaries encourage women\nto leave difficult studies of theology to the ardents. If only Jasnah had been\nable to see the true beauty of our doctrine.” He smiled, digging a thick book\nout of his bread basket. “I really had hoped, originally, to be able to show\nher what I mean.”\n“I doubt she’d react well to that.”\n“Perhaps,” he said idly, hefting the tome. “But to be the one who\nfinally convinced her!”\n“Brother Kabsal, that sounds almost like you’re seeking distinction.”\nHe blushed, and she realized she’d said something that genuinely\nembarrassed him. She winced, cursing her tongue.\n“Yes,” he said. “I do seek distinction. I shouldn’t wish so badly to be\nthe one who converts her. But I do. If she would just listen to my proof.”\n“Proof?”\n“I have real evidence that the Almighty exists.”\n“I’d like to see it.” Then she raised a finger, cutting him off. “Not\nbecause I doubt his existence, Kabsal. I’m just curious.”\nHe smiled. “It will be my pleasure to explain. But first, would you like\nanother slice of bread?”\n“I should say no,” she said, “and avoid excess, as my tutors trained me.\nBut instead I’ll say yes.”\n“Because of the jam?”\n“Of course,” she said, taking the bread. “How did your book of\noracular preserves describe me? Impulsive and spontaneous? I can do that.\nIf it means jam.”\nHe slathered a piece for her, then wiped his fingers on his cloth and\nopened his book, flipping through the pages until he reached one that had a\ndrawing on it.

The picture wasn’t of a\nperson; it depicted a pattern of some kind. A triangular shape, with three\noutlying wings and a peaked center.\n“Do you recognize this?” Kabsal asked.\nIt seemed familiar. “I feel that I should.”\n“It’s Kholinar,” he said. “The Alethi capital, drawn as it would appear\nfrom above. See the peaks here, the ridges there? It was built around the\nrock formation that was already there.” He flipped the page. “Here’s\nVedenar, capital of Jah Keved.” This one was a hexagonal pattern.\n“Akinah.” A circular pattern. “Thaylen City.” A four-pointed star pattern.\n“What does it mean?”\n“It is proof that the Almighty is in all things. You can see him here, in\nthese cities. Do you see how symmetrical they are?”\n“The cities were built by men, Kabsal. They wanted symmetry because\nit is holy.”\n“Yes, but in each case they built around existing rock formations.”\n“That doesn’t mean anything,” Shallan said. “I do believe, but I don’t\nknow if this is proof. Wind and water can create symmetry; you see it in\nnature all the time. The men picked areas that were roughly symmetrical,\nthen designed their cities to make up for any flaws.”\nHe turned to his basket again, rummaging. He came out with—of all\nthings—a metal plate. As she opened her mouth to ask a question, he held\nup his finger again and set the plate down on a small wooden stand that\nraised it a few inches above the tabletop.\nKabsal sprinkled white, powdery sand on the sheet of metal, coating it.\nThen he got out a bow, the kind drawn across strings to make music.\n“You came prepared for this demonstration, I see,” Shallan noted.\n“You really did want to make your case to Jasnah.”\nHe smiled, then drew the bow across the edge of the metal plate,\nmaking it vibrate. The sand hopped and bounced, like tiny insects dropped\nonto something hot.\n“This,” he said, “is called cymatics. The study of the patterns that\nsounds make when interacting with a physical medium.”\nAs he drew the bow again, the plate made a sound, almost a pure note.\nIt was actually enough to draw a single musicspren, which spun for a\nmoment in the air above him, then vanished. Kabsal finished, then gestured\nto the plate with a flourish.\n“So…?” Shallan asked.\n“Kholinar,” he said, holding up his book for comparison.\nShallan cocked her head. The pattern in the sand looked exactly like\nKholinar.\nHe dropped more sand on the plate and then drew the bow across it at\nanother point and the sand rearranged itself.\n“Vedenar,” he said.\nShe compared again. It was an exact match.\n“Thaylen City,” he said, repeating the process at another spot. He\ncarefully chose another point on the plate’s edge and bowed it one final\ntime. “Akinah. Shallan, proof of the Almighty’s existence is in the very\ncities we live in. Look at the perfect symmetry!”"

The Almighty,” he said, sitting. “Our very language is\nsymmetrical. Look at the glyphs—each one can be folded in half perfectly.\nAnd the alphabet too. Fold any line of text down across itself, and you’ll\nfind symmetry. Surely you know the story, that both glyphs and letters came\nfrom the Dawnsingers?”\n“Yes.”\n“Even our names. Yours is nearly perfect. Shallan. One letter off, an\nideal name for a lighteyed woman. Not too holy, but ever so close. The\noriginal names for the ten Silver Kingdoms. Alethela, Valhav, Shin Kak\nNish. Perfect, symmetrical.”\nHe reached forward, taking her hand. “It’s here, around us. Don’t\nforget that, Shallan, no matter what she says.”\n“I won’t,” she said, realizing how he’d guided the conversation. He’d\nsaid he believed her, but still he’d gone through his proofs. It was touching\nand annoying at the same time. She did not like condescension. But, then,\ncould one really blame an ardent for preaching?\nKabsal looked up suddenly, releasing her hand. “I hear footsteps.” He\nstood, and Shallan turned as Jasnah walked into the alcove, followed by a\nparshman carrying a basket of books. Jasnah showed no surprise at the\npresence of the ardent.\n“I’m sorry, Brightness Jasnah,” Shallan said, standing. “He—”\n“You are not a captive, child,” Jasnah interrupted brusquely. “You are\nallowed visitors. Just be careful to check your skin for tooth marks. These\ntypes have a habit of dragging their prey out to sea with them.”\nKabsal flushed. He moved to gather up his things.\nJasnah waved for the parshman to place her books on the table. “Can\nthat plate reproduce a cymatic pattern corresponding to Urithiru, priest? Or\ndo you only have patterns for the standard four cities?”\nKabsal looked at her, obviously shocked to realize that she knew\nexactly what the plate was for. He picked up his book. “Urithiru is just a\nfable.”\n“Odd. One would think that your type would be used to believing in\nfables.”\nHis face grew redder. He finished packing his things, then nodded\ncurtly to Shallan and walked hastily from the room.\n“If I may say so, Brightness,” Shallan said, “that was exceptionally\nrude of you.”\n“I’m prone to such bouts of incivility,” Jasnah said. “I’m certain he has\nheard what I’m like. I simply wanted to make sure he got what he\nexpected.”\n“You haven’t acted that way toward other ardents in the Palanaeum.”\n“The other ardents in the Palanaeum haven’t been working to turn my\nward against me.”\n“He wasn’t…” Shallan trailed off. “He was simply worried about my\nsoul.”"

He said\nsomething about the ultimate responsibility falling on the lighteyes. Lamaril\nkept screaming that you had promised to absolve him, and that Gaz should\nbe punished instead.”\nKaladin smirked ruefully. “He shouldn’t have had me beaten senseless.\nGaz?”\n“They left him in his position. I don’t know why.”\n“Right of responsibility. In a disaster like this, the lighteyes are\nsupposed to take most of the blame. They like to make a show of obeying\nold precepts like that, when it suits them. Why am I still alive?”\n“Something about an example,” Syl said, wrapping her translucent\narms around herself. “Kaladin, I feel cold.”\n“You can feel temperature?” Kaladin said, coughing.\n“Not usually. I can now. I don’t understand it. I…I don’t like it.”\n“It’ll be all right.”\n“You shouldn’t lie.”\n“Sometimes it’s all right to lie, Syl.”\n“And this is one of those times?”\nHe blinked, trying to ignore his wounds, the pressure in his head,\ntrying to clear his mind. He failed on all counts. “Yes,” he whispered.\n“I think I understand.”\n“So,” Kaladin said, resting his head back, the parietal knob of his skull\nresting against the wall, “I’m to be judged by the highstorm. They’ll let the\nstorm kill me.”\nHanging here, Kaladin would be exposed directly to the winds and\neverything they would throw at him. If you were prudent and took\nappropriate action, it was possible to survive outside in a highstorm, though\nit was a miserable experience. Kaladin had done it on several occasions,\nhunkered down, taking shelter in the lee of a rock formation. But hanging\non a wall facing directly stormward? He’d be cut to ribbons and crushed by\nstones.\n“I’ll be right back,” Syl said, dropping off his chest, taking the form of\na falling stone, then changing into windblown leaves near the ground and\nfluttering away, curving to the right. The lumberyard was empty. Kaladin\ncould smell the crisp, chill air, the land bracing for a highstorm. The lull, it\nwas called, when the wind fell still, the air cold, the pressure dropping, the\nhumidity rising right before a storm."

The lull, it\nwas called, when the wind fell still, the air cold, the pressure dropping, the\nhumidity rising right before a storm.\nA few seconds later, Rock poked his head around the wall, Syl on his\nshoulder. He crept up to Kaladin, a nervous Teft following. They were\njoined by Moash; despite the latter’s protests that he didn’t trust Kaladin, he\nlooked almost as concerned as the other two.\n“Lordling?” Moash said. “You awake?”\n“I’m conscious,” Kaladin croaked. “Everyone get back from the battle\nall right?”\n“All of our men, sure enough,” Teft said, scratching at his beard. “But\nwe lost the battle. It was a disaster. Over two hundred bridgemen dead.\nThose who survived were only enough to carry eleven bridges.”\nTwo hundred men, Kaladin thought. That’s my fault. I protected my\nown at the cost of others. I was too hasty.\nBridgemen aren’t supposed to survive. There’s something about that.\nHe wouldn’t be able to ask Lamaril. That man had gotten what he deserved,\nthough. If Kaladin had the ability to choose, such would be the end of all\nlighteyes, the king included.\n“We wanted to say something,” Rock said. “Is from all of the men.\nMost wouldn’t come out. Highstorm coming, and—”\n“It’s all right,” Kaladin whispered.\nTeft nudged Rock to continue.\n“Well, is this. We will remember you. Bridge Four, we won’t go back\nto how we were. Maybe all of us will die, but we’ll show the new ones.\nFires at night. Laughter. Living. We’ll make a tradition out of it. For you.”\nRock and Teft knew about the knobweed. They could keep earning extra\nmoney to pay for things.\n“You did this for us,” Moash put in. “We’d have died on that field.\nPerhaps as many as died in the other bridge crews. This way, we’re only\ngoing to lose one.”\n“I say it isn’t right, what they’re doing,” Teft said with a scowl. “We\ntalked about cutting you down….”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “That would only earn you a similar punishment.”\nThe three men shared glances. It seemed they’d come to the same\nconclusion.\n“What did Sadeas say?” Kaladin asked. “About me.”\n“That he understood how a bridgeman would want to save his life,”\nTeft said, “even at others’ expense. He called you a selfish coward, but\nacted like that was all that could be expected.”\n“He says he’s letting the Stormfather judge you,” Moash added.\n“Jezerezeh, king of Heralds. He says that if you deserve to live, you\nwill….” He trailed off. He knew as well as the others that unprotected men\ndidn’t survive highstorms, not like this.\n“I want you three to do something for me,” Kaladin said, closing his\neyes against the blood trickling down his face from his lip, which he’d\ncracked open by speaking.\n“Anything, Kaladin,” Rock said.\n“I want you to go back into the barrack and tell the men to come out"

Tell them to look up at me tied here. Tell them I’ll open my\neyes and look back at them, and they’ll know that I survived.”\nThe three bridgemen fell silent.\n“Yes, of course, Kaladin,” Teft said. “We’ll do it.”\n“Tell them,” Kaladin continued, voice firmer, “that it won’t end here.\nTell them I chose not to take my own life, and so there’s no way in\nDamnation I’m going to give it up to Sadeas.”\nRock smiled one of those broad smiles of his. “By the uli’tekanaki,\nKaladin. I almost believe you’ll do it.”\n“Here,” Teft said, handing him something. “For luck.”\nKaladin took the object in a weak, bloodstained hand. It was a sphere,\na full skymark. It was dun, the Stormlight gone from it. Carry a sphere with\nyou into the storm, the old saying said, and at least you’ll have light by\nwhich to see.\n“It’s all we were able to save from your pouch,” Teft said. “Gaz and\nLamaril got the rest. We complained, but what were we to do?”\n“Thank you,” Kaladin said.\nMoash and Rock retreated to the safety of the barrack, Syl leaving\nRock’s shoulder to stay with Kaladin. Teft lingered too, as if thinking to\nspend the storm with Kaladin. He eventually shook his head, muttering, and\njoined the others. Kaladin thought he heard the man calling himself a\ncoward.\nThe door to the barrack shut. Kaladin fingered the smooth glass sphere.\nThe sky was darkening, and not just because the sun was setting. Blackness\ngathered. The highstorm.\nSyl walked up the side of the wall, then sat down on it, looking at him,\ntiny face somber. “You told them you’d survive. What happens if you\ndon’t?”\nKaladin’s head was pounding with his pulse. “My mother would cringe\nif she knew how quickly the other soldiers taught me to gamble. First night\nin Amaram’s army, and they had me playing for spheres.”\n“Kaladin?” Syl said.\n“Sorry,” Kaladin said, rocking his head from side to side. “What you\nsaid, it reminded me of that night. There’s a term in gambling, you see. ‘In\nfor all,’ they say. It’s when you put all of your money on one bet.”\n“I don’t understand.”\n“I’m putting it all on the long bet,” Kaladin whispered. “If I die, then\nthey’ll come out, shake their heads, and tell themselves they knew it would\nhappen. But if I live, they’ll remember it. And it will give them hope. They\nmight see it as a miracle.”\nSyl was silent for a moment. “Do you want to be a miracle?”\n“No,” Kaladin whispered. “But for them, I will be.”\nIt was a desperate, foolish hope.

From this perspective, the storm was like the\nshadow of some enormous beast lumbering across the ground. He felt the\ndisturbing fuzziness of a person who had been hit too hard on the head.\nConcussion. That was what it was called. He was having trouble thinking,\nbut he didn’t want to fall unconscious. He wanted to stare at the highstorm\nstraight on, though it terrified him. He felt the same panic he’d felt looking\ndown into the black chasm, back when he’d nearly killed himself. It was the\nfear of what he could not see, what he could not know.\nThe stormwall approached, the visible curtain of rain and wind at the\nadvent of a highstorm. It was a massive wave of water, dirt, and rocks,\nhundreds of feet high, thousands upon thousands of windspren zipping\nbefore it.\nIn battle, he’d been able to fight his way to safety with the skill of his\nspear. When he’d stepped to the edge of the chasm, there had been a line of\nretreat. This time, there was nothing. No way to fight or avoid that black\nbeast, that shadow spanning the entirety of the horizon, plunging the world\ninto an early night. The eastern edge of the crater that made the warcamp\nhad been worn away, and Bridge Four’s barrack was first in its row. There\nwas nothing between him and the Plains. Nothing between him and the\nstorm.\nStaring at that raging, blustering, churning wave of wind-pushed water\nand debris, Kaladin felt as if he were watching the end of the world descend\nupon him.\nHe took a deep breath, the pain of his ribs forgotten, as the stormwall\ncrossed the lumberyard in a flash and slammed into him.\n“Though many wished Urithiru to be built in Alethela, it was obvious\nthat it could not be. And so it was that we asked for it to be placed\nwestward, in the place nearest to Honor.”\n—Perhaps the oldest surviving original source mentioning the city,\nrequoted in The Vavibrar, line 1804. What I wouldn’t give for a way to\ntranslate the Dawnchant.\nThe force of the stormwall nearly knocked him unconscious, but the sudden\nchill of it shocked him lucid.\nFor a moment, Kaladin couldn’t feel anything but that coldness. He\nwas pressed against the side of the barrack by the extended blast of water.\nRocks and bits of branch crashed against the stone around him; he was\nalready too numb to tell how many slashed or beat against his skin.\nHe bore it, dazed, eyes pressed shut and breath held. Then the\nstormwall passed, crashing onward. The next blast of wind came in from\nthe side—the air was swirling and gusting from all directions now. The\nwind flung him sideways—his back scraping against stone—and up into the\nair. The wind stabilized, blowing out of the east again. Kaladin hung in\ndarkness, and his feet yanked against the rope. In a panic, he realized that\nhe was now flapping in the wind like a kite, tied to the ring in the barrack’s\nslanted roof."

In a panic, he realized that\nhe was now flapping in the wind like a kite, tied to the ring in the barrack’s\nslanted roof.\nOnly that rope kept him from being blown along with the other debris\nto be tumbled and tossed before the storm across the entirety of Roshar. For\nthose few heartbeats, he could not think. He could only feel the panic and\nthe cold—one boiling out of his chest, the other trying to freeze him from\nthe skin inward. He screamed, clutching his single sphere as if it were a\nlifeline. The scream was a mistake, as it let that coldness course into his\nmouth. Like a spirit forcing its arm down his throat.\nThe wind was like a maelstrom, chaotic, moving in different\ndirections. One buff et ripped at him, then passed, and he fell to the roof of\nthe barrack with a thud. Almost immediately, the terrible winds tried to lift\nhim again, pounding his skin with waves of icy water. Thunder crashed, the\nheartbeat of the beast that had swallowed him. Lighting split the darkness\nlike white teeth in the night. The wind was so loud it nearly drowned out the\nthunder; howling and moaning.\n“Grab the roof, Kaladin!”\nSyl’s voice. So soft, so small. How could he hear it at all?\nNumbly, he realized he was lying facedown on the sloped roof. It\nwasn’t so steeply peaked that he was immediately pitched off, and the wind\nwas generally blowing him backward. He did as Syl said, grabbing the lip\nof the roof with cold, slick fingers. Then he lay facedown, head tucked\nbetween his arms. He still had the sphere in his hand, pressed against the\nstone rooftop. His fingers started to slip. The wind was blowing so hard,\ntrying to push him to the west. If he let go, he’d end up dangling in the air\nagain. His rope tether was not long enough for him to get to the other side\nof the shallow-peaked rooftop, where he’d be sheltered.\nA boulder hit the roof beside him—he couldn’t hear its impact or see it\nin the tempest’s darkness, but he could feel the building vibrate. The\nboulder rolled forward and crashed down to the ground. The entire storm\ndidn’t have such force, but occasional gusts could pick up and toss large\nobjects, hurling them hundreds of feet.\nHis fingers slipped further.\n“The ring,” Syl whispered.\nThe ring. The rope tied his legs to a steel ring on the side of the roof\nbehind him. Kaladin let go, then snatched the ring as he was blown\nbackward. He clutched to it. The rope continued down to his ankles, about\nthe length of his body. He thought for a moment of untying the ropes, but he\ndidn’t dare let go of the ring. He clung there, like a pennant flapping in the\nwind, holding the ring in both hands, sphere cupped inside one of them and\npressed against the steel.\nEach moment was a struggle. The wind yanked him left, then hurled\nhim right. He couldn’t know how long it lasted; time had no meaning in this\nplace of fury and tumult. His numbed, battered mind started to think he was"

A terrible dream inside his head, full of black, living winds.\nScreams in the air, bright and white, the flash of lightning revealing a\nterrible, twisted world of chaos and terror. The very buildings seemed\nblown sideways, the entire world askew, warped by the storm’s terrible\npower.\nIn those brief moments of light when he dared to look, he thought he\nsaw Syl standing in front of him, her face to the wind, tiny hands forward.\nAs if she were trying to hold back the storm and split the winds as a stone\ndivided the waters of a swift stream.\nThe cold of the rainwater numbed the scrapes and bruises. But it also\nnumbed his fingers. He didn’t feel them slipping. The next he knew, he was\nwhipping in the air again, tossed to the side, being slammed down against\nthe roof of the barrack.\nHe hit hard. His vision flashed with sparkling lights that melded\ntogether and were followed by blackness.\nNot unconsciousness, blackness.\nKaladin blinked. All was still. The storm was quiet, and everything\nwas purely dark. I’m dead, he thought immediately. But why could he feel\nthe wet stone roof beneath him? He shook his head, dripping rainwater\ndown his face. There was no lightning, no wind, no rain. The silence was\nunnatural.\nHe stumbled to his feet, managing to stand on the gently sloped roof.\nThe stone was slick beneath his toes. He couldn’t feel his wounds. The pain\njust wasn’t there.\nHe opened his mouth to call out into the darkness, but hesitated. That\nsilence was not to be broken. The air itself seemed to weigh less, as did he.\nHe almost felt as if he could float away.\nIn that darkness, an enormous face appeared just in front of his. A face\nof blackness, yet faintly traced in the dark. It was wide, the breadth of a\nmassive thunderhead, and extended far to either side, yet it was somehow\nstill visible to Kaladin. Inhuman. Smiling.\nKaladin felt a deep chill—a rolling prickle of ice—scurry down his\nspine and through his entire body. The sphere suddenly burst to life in his\nhand, flaring with a sapphire glow. It illuminated the stone roof beneath\nhim, making his fist blaze with blue fire. His shirt was in tatters, his skin\nlacerated. He looked down at himself, shocked, then looked up at the face.\nIt was gone. There was only the darkness.\nLightning flashed, and Kaladin’s pains returned. He gasped, falling to\nhis knees before the rain and the wind. He slipped down, face hitting the\nrooftop.\nWhat had that been? A vision? A delusion? His strength was fleeing\nhim, his thoughts growing muddled again. The winds weren’t as strong\nnow, but the rain was still so cold. Lethargic, confused, nearly overwhelmed\nby his pain, he brought his hand up to the side and looked at the sphere. It\nwas glowing.

His grandfather had complained about that in his later years,\nand Teft had called him daft. Now he felt it too.\nStorming Damnation, he thought, wearily stepping outside. It was still\nraining, of course. These were the after-flurries of drizzle that trailed a\nhighstorm, the riddens. A few rainspren sat in puddles, like blue candles,\nand a few windspren danced in the stormwinds. The rain was cold, and he\nsplashed through puddles that soaked his sandaled feet, chilling them\nstraight through the skin and muscle. He hated being wet. But, then, he\nhated a lot of things.\nFor a while, life had been looking up. Not now.\nHow did everything go so wrong so quickly? he thought, holding his\narms close, walking slowly and watching his feet. Some soldiers had left\ntheir barracks and stood nearby, wearing raincloaks, watching. Probably to\nmake certain nobody had snuck out to cut Kaladin down early. They didn’t\ntry to stop Rock, though. The storm had passed.\nRock charged around the side of the building. Other bridgemen left the\nbarrack behind as Teft followed Rock. Storming Horneater. Like a big\nlumbering chull. He actually believed. He thought they’d find that foolish\nyoung bridgeleader alive. Probably figured they’d discover him having a\nnice cup of tea, relaxing in the shade with the Stormfather himself.\nAnd you don’t believe? Teft asked himself, still looking down. If you\ndon’t, why are you following? But if you did believe, you’d look. You\nwouldn’t stare at your feet. You’d look up and see.\nCould a man both believe, and not believe, at the same time? Teft\nstopped beside Rock and—steeling himself—looked up at the wall of the\nbarrack.\nThere he saw what he’d expected and what he’d feared. The corpse\nlooked like a hunk of slaughter house meat, skinned and bled. Was that a\nperson? Kaladin’s skin was sliced in a hundred places, dribbles of blood\nmixing with rainwater running down the side of the building. The lad’s\nbody still hung by the ankles. His shirt had been ripped off; his bridgeman\ntrousers were ragged. Ironically, his face was cleaner now than when they’d\nleft him, washed by the storm.\nTeft had seen enough dead men on the battlefield to know what he was\nlooking at. Poor lad, he thought, shaking his head as the rest of Bridge Four\ngathered around him and Rock, quiet, horrified. You almost made me\nbelieve in you.\nKaladin’s eyes snapped open.\nThe gathered bridgemen gasped, several cursing and falling to the\nground, splashing in the pools of rainwater.

It\nsplashed into a puddle and stopped there. It was dun, no Stormlight in it.\nWhat in the name of Kelek? Teft thought, kneeling. You left a sphere\nout in the storm, and it gathered Stormlight.

Is still alive! We need ladder and knife!\nHurry!”\nThe bridgemen scrambled. The soldiers approached, muttering, but\nthey didn’t stop the bridgemen. Sadeas himself had declared that the\nStormfather would choose Kaladin’s fate. Everyone knew that meant death.\nExcept…Teft stood up straight, holding the dun sphere. An empty\nsphere after a storm, he thought. And a man who’s still alive when he\nshould be dead. Two impossibilities.\nTogether they bespoke something that should be even more\nimpossible.\n“Where’s that ladder!” Teft found himself yelling. “Curse you all,\nhurry, hurry!

Shallan didn’t know much about fabrials yet,\nthough part of her was very intrigued. This type was becoming increasingly\ncommon. Just the other day, the Conclave staff had sent Jasnah one to heat\nher chambers.\nThe water didn’t have to be carried in but came out of pipes. At the\nturn of a lever, water flowed in. It was warm when it entered, and was kept\nheated by the fabrials set into the sides of the pool. Shallan had bathed in\nthe chamber herself, and it was absolutely marvelous.\nThe practical decor was of rock decorated with small colorful stones\nset in mortar up the sides of the walls. Shallan sat beside the pool, fully\ndressed, reading as she waited on Jasnah’s needs. The book was Gavilar’s\naccount—as spoken to Jasnah herself years ago—after his first meeting\nwith the strange parshmen later known as the Parshendi.\nOccasionally, during our explorations, we’d meet with natives, she\nread. Not parshmen. Natan people, with their pale bluish skin, wide noses,\nand wool-like white hair. In exchange for gifts of food, they would point us\nto the hunting grounds of greatshells.\nThen we met the parshmen. I’d been on a half-dozen expeditions to\nNatanatan, but never had I seen anything like this! Parshmen, living on\ntheir own? All logic, experience, and science declared that to be an\nimpossibility. Parshmen need the hand of civilized peoples to guide them.\nThis has been proven time and time again. Leave one out in the wilderness,\nand it will just sit there, doing nothing, until someone comes along to give it\norders.\nYet here was a group who could hunt, make weapons, build buildings,\nand—indeed—create their own civilization. We soon realized that this\nsingle discovery could expand, perhaps overthrow, all we understood about\nour gentle servants.\nShallan moved her eyes down to the bottom of the page where—\nseparated by a line—the undertext was written in a small, cramped script.\nMost books dictated by men had an undertext, notes added by the woman or\nardent who scribed the book. By unspoken agreement, the undertext was\nnever shared out loud. Here, a wife would sometimes clarify—or even\ncontradict—the account of her husband. The only way to preserve such\nhonesty for future scholars was to maintain the sanctity and secrecy of the\nwriting.\nIt should be noted, Jasnah had written in the undertext to this passage,\nthat I have adapted my father’s words—by his own instruction—to make\nthem more appropriate for recording. That meant she made his dictation\nsound more scholarly and impressive. In addition, by most accounts, King\nGavilar originally ignored these strange, self-sufficient parshmen. It was\nonly after explanation by his scholars and scribes that he understood the\nimport of what he’d discovered. This inclusion is not meant to highlight my\nfather’s ignorance; he was, and is, a warrior. His attention was not on the\nanthropological import of our expedition, but upon the hunt that was to be\nits culmination.\nShallan closed the cover, thoughtful. The volume was from Jasnah’s"

Atop the\nfolded garments, a small golden pouch held the Soulcaster. Shallan glanced\nat Jasnah. The princess floated face-up in the pool, black hair fanning out\nbehind her in the water, her eyes closed. Her daily bath was the one time\nshe seemed to relax completely.

Curiously.\n“Why did your father want to make a treaty with the Parshendi?”\nShallan found herself asking as she walked.\n“Why wouldn’t he want to?”\n“That’s not an answer.”\n“Of course it is. It’s just not one that tells you anything.”\n“It would help, Brightness, if you would give me a useful answer.”\n“Then ask a useful question.”\nShallan set her jaw. “What did the Parshendi have that King Gavilar\nwanted?”\nJasnah smiled, closing her eyes again. “Closer. But you can probably\nguess the answer to that.”\n“Shards.”\nJasnah nodded, still relaxed in the water.\n“The text doesn’t mention them,” Shallan said.\n“My father didn’t speak of them,” Jasnah said. “But from things he\nsaid…well, I now suspect that they motivated the treaty.”\n“Can you be sure he knew, though? Maybe he just wanted the\ngemhearts.”\n“Perhaps,” Jasnah said. “The Parshendi seemed amused at our interest\nin the gemstones woven into their beards.” She smiled. “You should have\nseen our shock when we discovered where they’d gotten them. When the\nlanceryn died off during the scouring of Aimia, we thought we’d seen the\nlast gemhearts of large size. And yet here was another great-shelled beast\nwith them, living in a land not too distant from Kholinar itself."

        "text": "last gemhearts of large size. And yet here was another great-shelled beast\nwith them, living in a land not too distant from Kholinar itself.\n“Anyway, the Parshendi were willing to share them with us, so long as\nthey could still hunt them too. To them, if you took the trouble to hunt the\nchasmfiends, their gemhearts were yours. I doubt a treaty would have been\nneeded for that. And yet, just before leaving to return to Alethkar, my father\nsuddenly began talking fervently of the need for an agreement.”\n“So what happened? What changed?”\n“I can’t be certain. However, he once described the strange actions of a\nParshendi warrior during a chasmfiend hunt. Instead of reaching for his\nspear when the greatshell appeared, this man held his hand to the side in a\nvery suspicious way. Only my father saw it; I suspected he believed the\nman planned to summon a Blade. The Parshendi realized what he was\ndoing, and stopped himself. My father didn’t speak of it further, and I\nassume he didn’t want the world’s eyes on the Shattered Plains any more\nthan they already were.”\nShallan tapped her book. “It seems tenuous. If he was sure about the\nBlades, he must have seen more.”\n“I suspect so as well. But I studied the treaty carefully, after his death.\nThe clauses for favored trade status and mutual border crossing could very\nwell have been a step toward folding the Parshendi into Alethkar as a\nnation. It certainly would have prevented the Parshendi from trading their\nShards to other kingdoms without coming to us first. Perhaps that was all he\nwanted to do.”\n“But why kill him?” Shallan said, arms crossed, strolling in the\ndirection of Jasnah’s folded clothing. “Did the Parshendi realize that he\nintended to have their Shardblades, and so struck at him preemptively?”\n“Uncertain,” Jasnah said. She sounded skeptical. Why did she think\nthe Parshendi killed Gavilar? Shallan nearly asked, but she had a feeling she\nwouldn’t get any more out of Jasnah. The woman expected Shallan to think,\ndiscover, and draw conclusions on her own.\nShallan stopped beside the bench. The pouch holding the Soulcaster\nwas open, the drawstrings loose. She could see the precious artifact curled\nup inside. The swap would be easy. She had used a large chunk of her\nmoney to buy gemstones that matched Jasnah’s, and had put them into the\nbroken Soulcaster. The two were now exactly identical.\nShe still hadn’t learned anything about using the fabrial; she’d tried to\nfind a way to ask, but Jasnah avoided speaking of the Soulcaster. Pushing\nharder would be suspicious. Shallan would have to get information\nelsewhere. Perhaps from Kabsal, or maybe from a book in the Palanaeum.\nRegardless, the time was upon her. Shallan found her hand going to\nher safepouch, and she felt inside of it, running her fingers along the chains\nof her broken fabrial. Her heart beat faster. She glanced at Jasnah, but the\nwoman was just lying there, floating, eyes closed. What if she opened her\neyes?\nDon’t think of that! Shallan told herself. Just do it. Make the swap. It’s"

It’s\nso close….\n“You are progressing more quickly than I had assumed you would,”\nJasnah said suddenly.\nShallan spun, but Jasnah’s eyes were still closed. “I was wrong to\njudge you so harshly because of your prior education. I myself have often\nsaid that passion outperforms upbringing. You have the determination and\nthe capacity to become a respected scholar, Shallan. I realize that the\nanswers seem slow in coming, but continue your research. You will have\nthem eventually.”\nShallan stood for a moment, hand in her pouch, heart thumping\nuncontrollably. She felt sick. I can’t do it, she realized. Stormfather, but I’m\na fool. I came all of this way…and now I can’t do it!\nShe pulled her hand from her pouch and stalked back across the\nbathing chamber to her chair. What was she going to tell her brothers? Had\nshe just doomed her family? She sat down, setting her book aside and\nsighing, prompting Jasnah to open her eyes. Jasnah watched her, then\nrighted herself in the water and gestured for the hairsoap.\nGritting her teeth, Shallan stood up and fetched the soap tray for\nJasnah, bringing it over and squatting down to proffer it. Jasnah took the\npowdery hairsoap and mashed it in her hand, lathering it before putting it\ninto her sleek black hair with both hands. Even naked, Jasnah Kholin was\ncomposed and in control.\n“Perhaps we have spent too much time indoors of late,” the princess\nsaid. “You look penned up, Shallan. Anxious.”\n“I’m fine,” Shallan said brusquely.\n“Hum, yes. As evidenced by your perfectly reasonable, relaxed tone.\nPerhaps we need to shift some of your training from history to something\nmore hands-on, more visceral.”\n“Like natural science?” Shallan asked, perking up.\nJasnah tilted her head back. Shallan knelt down on a towel beside the\npool, then reached down with her freehand, massaging the soap into her\nmistress’s lush tresses.\n“I was thinking philosophy,” Jasnah said.\nShallan blinked. “Philosophy? What good is that?” Isn’t it the art of\nsaying nothing with as many words as possible?\n“Philosophy is an important field of study,” Jasnah said sternly.\n“Particularly if you’re going to be involved in court politics. The nature of\nmorality must be considered, and preferably before one is exposed to\nsituations where a moral decision is required.”\n“Yes, Brightness. Though I fail to see how philosophy is more ‘hands-\non’ than history.”\n“History, by definition, cannot be experienced directly. As it is\nhappening, it is the present, and that is philosophy’s realm.”\n“That’s just a matter of definition.”\n“Yes,” Jasnah said, “all words have a tendency to be subject to how\nthey are defined.”\n“I suppose,” Shallan said, leaning back, letting Jasnah dunk her hair to\nclean off the soap.\nThe princess began scrubbing her skin with mildly abrasive soap."

What happened to your\nwit?”\nShallan glanced at the bench and its precious fabrial. After all this\ntime, she had proven too weak to do what needed to be done. “My wit is on\ntemporary hiatus, Brightness,” she said. “Pending review by its colleagues,\nsincerity and temerity.”\nJasnah raised an eyebrow at her.\nShallan sat back on her heels, still kneeling on the towel. “How do you\nknow what is right, Jasnah? If you don’t listen to the devotaries, how do\nyou decide?”\n“That depends upon one’s philosophy. What is most important to\nyou?”\n“I don’t know. Can’t you tell me?”\n“No,” Jasnah replied. “If I gave you the answers, I’d be no better than\nthe devotaries, prescribing beliefs.”\n“They aren’t evil, Jasnah.”\n“Except when they try to rule the world.”\nShallan drew her lips into a thin line. The War of Loss had destroyed\nthe Hierocracy, shattering Vorinism into the devotaries. That was the\ninevitable result of a religion trying to rule. The devotaries were to teach\nmorals, not enforce them. Enforcement was for the lighteyes.\n“You say you can’t give me answers,” Shallan said. “But can’t I ask\nfor the advice of someone wise? Someone who’s gone before? Why write\nour philosophies, draw our conclusions, if not to influence others? You\nyourself told me that information is worthless unless we use it to make\njudgments.”\nJasnah smiled, dunking her arms and washing off the soap. Shallan\ncaught a victorious glimmer in her eye. She wasn’t necessarily advocating\nideas because she believed them; she just wanted to push Shallan. It was\ninfuriating. How was Shallan to know what Jasnah really thought if she\nadopted conflicting points of view like this?\n“You act as if there were one answer,” Jasnah said, gesturing to\nShallan to fetch a towel and climbing from the pool. “A single, eternally\nperfect response.”\nShallan hastily complied, bearing a large, fluffy towel. “Isn’t that what\nphilosophy is about? Finding the answers? Seeking the truth, the real\nmeaning of things?”\nToweling off, Jasnah raised an eyebrow at her.\n“What?” Shallan asked, suddenly self-conscious.\n“I believe it is time for a field exercise,” Jasnah said. “Outside of the\nPalanaeum.”\n“Now?” Shallan asked. “It’s so late!”\n“I told you philosophy was a hands-on art,” Jasnah said, wrapping the\ntowel around herself, then reaching down and taking the Soulcaster out of\nits pouch. She slipped the chains around her fingers, securing the gemstones\nto the back of her hand. “I’ll prove it to you. Come, help me dress.”\nAs a child, Shallan had relished those evenings when she’d been able to slip\naway into the gardens.

When the blanket of darkness rested atop\nthe grounds, they had seemed a different place entirely. In those shadows,\nshe’d been able to imagine that the rockbuds, shalebark, and trees were\nsome foreign fauna. The scrapings of cremlings climbing out of cracks had\nbecome the footsteps of mysterious people from far-off lands. Large-eyed\ntraders from Shinovar, a greatshell rider from Kadrix, or a narrowboat sailor\nfrom the Purelake.\nShe didn’t have those same imaginings when walking Kharbranth at\nnight. Imagining dark wanderers in the night had once been an intriguing\ngame—but here, dark wanderers were likely to be real. Instead of becoming\na mysterious, intriguing place at night, Kharbranth seemed much the same\nto her—just more dangerous.\nJasnah ignored the calls of rickshaw pullers and palanquin porters. She\nwalked slowly in a beautiful dress of violet and gold, Shallan following in\nblue silk. Jasnah hadn’t taken time to have her hair done following her bath,\nand she wore it loose, cascading across her shoulders, almost scandalous in\nits freedom.\nThey walked the Ralinsa—the main thoroughfare that led down the\nhillside in switchbacks, connecting Conclave and port. Despite the late\nhour, the roadway was crowded, and many of the men who walked here\nseemed to bear the night inside of them. They were gruff er, more shadowed\nof face. Shouts still rang through the city, but those carried the night in them\ntoo, measured by the roughness of their words and the sharpness of their\ntones. The steep, slanted hillside that formed the city was no less crowded\nwith buildings than always, yet these too seemed to draw in the night.\nBlackened, like stones burned by a fire. Hollow remains.\nThe bells still rang. In the darkness, each ring was a tiny scream. They\nmade the wind more present, a living thing that caused a chiming\ncacophony each time it passed. A breeze rose, and an avalanche of sound\ncame tumbling across the Ralinsa. Shallan nearly found herself ducking\nbefore it.\n“Brightness,” Shallan said. “Shouldn’t we call for a palanquin?”\n“A palanquin might inhibit the lesson.”\n“I’ll be all right learning that lesson during the day, if you wouldn’t\nmind.”\nJasnah stopped, looking off the Ralinsa and toward a darker side street.\n“What do you think of that roadway, Shallan?”\n“It doesn’t look particularly appealing to me.”\n“And yet,” Jasnah said, “it is the most direct route from the Ralinsa to\nthe theater district.”\n“Is that where we’re going?”\n“We aren’t ‘going’ anywhere,” Jasnah said, taking off down the side\nstreet. “We are acting, pondering, and learning.”\nShallan followed nervously. The night swallowed them; only the\noccasional light from late-night taverns and shops offered illumination.\nJasnah wore her black, fingerless glove over her Soulcaster, hiding the light\nof its gemstones.\nShallan found herself creeping.

Her slippered feet could feel every\nchange in the ground underfoot, each pebble and crack. She looked about\nnervously as they passed a group of workers gathered around a tavern\ndoorway. They were darkeyes, of course. In the night, that distinction\nseemed more profound.\n“Brightness?” Shallan asked in a hushed tone.\n“When we are young,” Jasnah said, “we want simple answers. There is\nno greater indication of youth, perhaps, than the desire for everything to be\nas it should. As it has ever been.”\nShallan frowned, still watching the men by the tavern over her\nshoulder.\n“The older we grow,” Jasnah said, “the more we question. We begin to\nask why. And yet, we still want the answers to be simple. We assume that\nthe people around us—adults, leaders—will have those answers. Whatever\nthey give often satisfies us.”\n“I was never satisfied,” Shallan said softly. “I wanted more.”\n“You were mature,” Jasnah said. “What you describe happens to most\nof us, as we age. Indeed, it seems to me that aging, wisdom, and wondering\nare synonymous. The older we grow, the more likely we are to reject the\nsimple answers. Unless someone gets in our way and demands they be\naccepted regardless.” Jasnah’s eyes narrowed. “You wonder why I reject the\ndevotaries.”\n“I do.”\n“Most of them seek to stop the questions.” Jasnah halted. Then she\nbriefly pulled back her glove, using the light beneath to reveal the street\naround her. The gemstones on her hand—larger than broams—blazed like\ntorches, red, white, and grey.\n“Is it wise to be showing your wealth like that, Brightness?” Shallan\nsaid, speaking very softly and glancing about her.\n“No,” Jasnah said. “It is most certainly not. Particularly not here. You\nsee, this street has gained a particular reputation lately. On three separate\noccasions during the last two months, theatergoers who chose this route to\nthe main road were accosted by footpads. In each case, the people were\nmurdered.”\nShallan felt herself grow pale.\n“The city watch,” Jasnah said, “has done nothing. Taravangian has sent\nthem several pointed reprimands, but the captain of the watch is cousin to a\nvery influential lighteyes in the city, and Taravangian is not a terribly\npowerful king. Some suspect that there is more going on, that the footpads\nmight be bribing the watch. The politics of it are irrelevant at the moment\nfor, as you can see, no members of the watch are guarding the place, despite\nits reputation.”\nJasnah pulled her glove back on, plunging the roadway back into\ndarkness. Shallan blinked, her eyes adjusting.\n“How foolish,” Jasnah said, “would you say it is for us to come here,\ntwo undefended women wearing costly clothing and bearing riches?”\n“Very foolish. Jasnah, can we go? Please. Whatever lesson you have in\nmind isn’t worth this.”\nJasnah drew her lips into a line, then looked toward a narrow, darker"

Whatever lesson you have in\nmind isn’t worth this.”\nJasnah drew her lips into a line, then looked toward a narrow, darker\nalleyway off the road they were on. It was almost completely black now\nthat Jasnah had replaced her glove.\n“You’re at an interesting place in your life, Shallan,” Jasnah said,\nflexing her hand. “You are old enough to wonder, to ask, to reject what is\npresented to you simply because it was presented to you. But you also cling\nto the idealism of youth. You feel there must be some single, all-defining\nTruth—and you think that once you find it, all that once confused you will\nsuddenly make sense.”\n“I…” Shallan wanted to argue, but Jasnah’s words were tellingly\naccurate. The terrible things Shallan had done, the terrible thing she had\nplanned to do, haunted her. Was it possible to do something horrible in the\nname of accomplishing something wonderful?\nJasnah walked into the narrow alleyway.\n“Jasnah!” Shallan said. “What are you doing?”\n“This is philosophy in action, child,” Jasnah said. “Come with me.”\nShallan hesitated at the mouth of the alleyway, her heart thumping, her\nthoughts muddled. The wind blew and bells rang, like frozen raindrops\nshattering against the stones. In a moment of decision, she rushed after\nJasnah, preferring company, even in the dark, to being alone. The shrouded\nglimmer of the Soulcaster was barely enough to light their way, and Shallan\nfollowed in Jasnah’s shadow.\nNoise from behind. Shallan turned with a start to see several dark\nforms crowding into the alley. “Oh, Stormfather,” she whispered. Why?\nWhy was Jasnah doing this?\nShaking, Shallan grabbed at Jasnah’s dress with her freehand. Other\nshadows were moving in front of them, from the far side of the alley. They\ngrew closer, grunting, splashing through foul, stagnant puddles. Chill water\nhad already soaked Shallan’s slippers.\nJasnah stopped moving. The frail light of her cloaked Soulcaster\nreflected off metal in the hands of their stalkers. Swords or knives.\nThese men meant murder. You didn’t rob women like Shallan and\nJasnah, women with powerful connections, then leave them alive as\nwitnesses. Men like these were not the gentlemen bandits of romantic\nstories. They lived each day knowing that if they were caught, they would\nbe hanged.\nParalyzed by fear, Shallan couldn’t even scream.\nStormfather, Stormfather, Stormfather!\n“And now,” Jasnah said, voice hard and grim, “the lesson.” She\nwhipped off her glove.\nThe sudden light was nearly blinding. Shallan raised a hand against it,\nstumbling back against the alley wall. There were four men around them.\nNot the men from the tavern entrance, but others. Men she hadn’t noticed\nwatching them. She could see the knives now, and she could also see the\nmurder in their eyes.\nHer scream finally broke free.\nThe men grunted at the glare, but shoved their way forward.

A thick-\nchested man with a dark beard came up to Jasnah, weapon raised. She\ncalmly reached her hand out—fingers splayed—and pressed it against his\nchest as he swung a knife. Shallan’s breath caught in her throat.\nJasnah’s hand sank into the man’s skin, and he froze. A second later he\nburned.\nNo, he became fire. Transformed into flames in an eyeblink. Rising\naround Jasnah’s hand, they formed the outline of a man with head thrown\nback and mouth open. For just a moment, the blaze of the man’s death\noutshone Jasnah’s gemstones.\nShallan’s scream trailed off. The figure of flames was strangely\nbeautiful. It was gone in a moment, the fire dissipating into the night air,\nleaving an orange afterimage in Shallan’s eyes.\nThe other three men began to curse, scrambling away, tripping over\none another in their panic. One fell. Jasnah turned casually, brushing his\nshoulder with her fingers as he struggled to his knees. He became crystal, a\nfigure of pure, flawless quartz—his clothing transformed along with him.\nThe diamond in Jasnah’s Soulcaster faded, but there was still plenty of\nStormlight left to send rainbow sparkles through the transformed corpse.\nThe other two men fled in opposite directions. Jasnah took a deep\nbreath, closing her eyes, lifting her hand above her head. Shallan held her\nsafehand to her breast, stunned, confused. Terrified.\nStormlight shot from Jasnah’s hand like twin bolts of lightning,\nsymmetrical. One struck each of the footpads and they popped, puffing into\nsmoke. Their empty clothing dropped to the ground. With a sharp snap, the\nsmokestone crystal on Jasnah’s Soulcaster cracked, its light vanishing,\nleaving her with just the diamond and the ruby.\nThe remains of the two footpads rose into the air, small billows of\ngreasy vapor. Jasnah opened her eyes, looking eerily calm. She tugged her\nglove back on—using her safehand to hold it against her stomach and\nsliding her freehand fingers in. Then she calmly walked back the way they\nhad come. She left the crystal corpse kneeling with hand upraised. Frozen\nforever.\nShallan pried herself off the wall and hastened after Jasnah, sickened\nand amazed. Ardents were forbidden to use their Soulcasters on people.\nThey rarely even used them in front of others. And how had Jasnah struck\ndown two men at a distance? From everything Shallan had read—what little\nthere was to find—Soulcasting required physical contact.\nToo overwhelmed to demand answers, she stood silent—freehand held\nto the side of her head, trying to control her trembling and her gasping\nbreaths—as Jasnah called for a palanquin. One came eventually, and the\ntwo women climbed in.\nThe bearers carried them toward the Ralinsa, their steps jostling\nShallan and Jasnah, who sat across from one another in the palanquin.\nJasnah idly popped the broken smokestone from her Soulcaster, then tucked"

It could be sold to a gemsmith, who could cut smaller\ngemstones from the salvaged pieces.\n“That was horrible,” Shallan finally said, hand still held to her breast.\n“It was one of the most awful things I’ve ever experienced. You killed four\nmen.”\n“Four men who were planning to beat, rob, kill, and possibly rape us.”\n“You tempted them into coming for us!”\n“Did I force them to commit any crimes?”\n“You showed off your gemstones.”\n“Can a woman not walk with her possessions down the street of a\ncity?”\n“At night?” Shallan asked. “Through a rough area? Displaying wealth?\nYou all but asked for what happened!”\n“Does that make it right?” Jasnah said, leaning forward. “Do you\ncondone what the men were planning to do?”\n“Of course not. But that doesn’t make what you did right either!”\n“And yet, those men are off the street. The people of this city are that\nmuch safer. The issue that Taravangian has been so worried about has been\nsolved, and no more theatergoers will fall to those thugs. How many lives\ndid I just save?”\n“I know how many you just took,” Shallan said. “And through the\npower of something that should be holy!”\n“Philosophy in action. An important lesson for you.”\n“You did all this just to prove a point,” Shallan said softly. “You did\nthis to prove to me that you could. Damnation, Jasnah, how could you do\nsomething like that?”\nJasnah didn’t reply. Shallan stared at the woman, searching for\nemotion in those expressionless eyes. Stormfather. Did I ever really know\nthis woman? Who is she, really?\nJasnah leaned back, watching the city pass. “I did not do this just to\nprove a point, child. I have been feeling for some time that I took advantage\nof His Majesty’s hospitality. He doesn’t realize how much trouble he could\nface for allying himself with me. Besides, men like those…” There was\nsomething in her voice, an edge Shallan had never heard before.\nWhat was done to you? Shallan wondered with horror. And who did it?\n“Regardless,” Jasnah continued, “tonight’s actions came about because\nI chose this path, not because of anything I felt you needed to see. However,\nthe opportunity also presented a chance for instruction, for questions. Am I\na monster or am I a hero? Did I just slaughter four men, or did I stop four\nmurderers from walking the streets? Does one deserve to have evil done to\nher by consequence of putting herself where evil can reach her? Did I have\na right to defend myself? Or was I just looking for an excuse to end lives?”\n“I don’t know,” Shallan whispered.\n“You will spend the next week researching it and thinking on it. If you\nwish to be a scholar—a true scholar who changes the world—then you will\nneed to face questions like this. There will be times when you must make\ndecisions that churn your stomach, Shallan Davar. I’ll have you ready to\nmake those decisions.”"

I’ll have you ready to\nmake those decisions.”\nJasnah fell silent, looking out the side as the palanquin bearers\nmarched them up to the Conclave. Too troubled to say more, Shallan\nsuffered the rest of the trip in silence. She followed Jasnah through the\nhushed hallways to their rooms, passing scholars on their way to the\nPalanaeum for some midnight study.\nInside their rooms, Shallan helped Jasnah undress, though she hated\ntouching the woman. She shouldn’t have felt that way. The men Jasnah had\nkilled were terrible creatures, and she had little doubt that they would have\nkilled her. But it wasn’t the act itself so much as the cold callousness of it\nthat bothered her.\nStill feeling numb, Shallan fetched Jasnah a sleeping robe as the\nwoman removed her jewelry and set it on the dressing table. “You could\nhave let the other three get away,” Shallan said, walking back toward\nJasnah, who had sat down to brush her hair. “You only needed to kill one of\nthem.”\n“No, I didn’t,” Jasnah said.\n“Why? They would have been too frightened to do something like that\nagain.”\n“You don’t know that. I sincerely wanted those men gone. A careless\nbarmaid walking home the wrong way cannot protect herself, but I can. And\nI will.”\n“You have no authority to do so, not in someone else’s city.”\n“True,” Jasnah said. “Another point to consider, I suppose.” She raised\nthe brush to her hair, pointedly turning away from Shallan. She closed her\neyes, as if to shut Shallan out.\nThe Soulcaster sat on the dressing table beside Jasnah’s earrings.\nShallan gritted her teeth, holding the soft, silken robe. Jasnah sat in her\nwhite underdress, brushing her hair.\nThere will be times when you must make decisions that churn your\nstomach, Shallan Davar….\nI’ve faced them already.\nI’m facing one now.\nHow dare Jasnah do this? How dare she make Shallan a part of it?\nHow dare she use something beautiful and holy as a device for destruction?\nJasnah didn’t deserve to own the Soulcaster.\nWith a swift move of her hand, Shallan tucked the folded robe under\nher safearm, then shoved her hand into her safepouch and popped out the\nintact smokestone from her father’s Soulcaster. She stepped up to the\ndressing table, and—using the motion of placing the robe onto the table as a\ncover—made the exchange. She slid the working Soulcaster into her\nsafehand within its sleeve, stepping back as Jasnah opened her eyes and\nglanced at the robe, which now sat innocently beside the nonfunctional\nSoulcaster.\nShallan’s breath caught in her throat.\nJasnah closed her eyes again, handing the brush toward Shallan. “Fifty\nstrokes tonight, Shallan. It has been a fatiguing day.”\nShallan moved by rote, brushing her mistress’s hair while clutching the\nstolen Soulcaster in her hidden safehand, panicked that Jasnah would notice\nthe swap at any moment."

Not when she put on her robe. Not when she tucked the\nbroken Soulcaster away in her jewelry case and locked it with a key she\nwore around her neck as she slept.\nShallan walked from the room stunned, in turmoil. Exhausted,\nsickened, confused.\nBut undiscovered.\nFIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\n“Kaladin, look at this rock,” Tien said. “It changes colors when you look at\nit from different sides.”\nKal looked away from the window, glancing at his brother. Now\nthirteen years of age, Tien had turned from an eager boy into an eager\nadolescent. Though he’d grown, he was still small for his age, and his mop\nof black and brown hair still refused all attempts at order. He was squatting\nbeside the lacquered cobwood dinner table, eyes level with the glossy\nsurface, looking at a small, lumpish rock.\nKal sat on a stool peeling longroots with a short knife. The brown roots\nwere dirty on the outside and sticky when he sliced into them, so working\non them coated his fingers with a thick layer of crem. He finished a root and\nhanded it up to his mother, who washed it off and sliced it into the stew pot.\n“Mother, look at this,” Tien said. Late-afternoon sunlight streamed\nthrough the leeside window, bathing the table. “From this side, the rock\nsparkles red, but from the other side, it’s green.”\n“Perhaps it’s magical,” Hesina said. Chunk after chunk of longroot\nplunked into the water, each splash with a slightly different note.\n“I think it must be,” Tien said. “Or it has a spren. Do spren live in\nrocks?”\n“Spren live in everything,” Hesina replied.\n“They can’t live in everything,” Kal said, dropping a peel into the pail\nat his feet. He glanced out the window, watching the road that led from the\ntown to the citylord’s mansion.\n“They do,” Hesina said. “Spren appear when something changes—\nwhen fear appears, or when it begins to rain. They are the heart of change,\nand therefore the heart of all things.”\n“This longroot,” Kal said, holding it up skeptically.\n“Has a spren.”\n“And if you slice it up?”\n“Each bit has a spren. Only smaller.”\nKal frowned, looking over the long tuber. They grew in cracks in the\nstone where water collected. They tasted faintly of minerals, but were easy\nto grow. His family needed food that didn’t cost much, these days.\n“So we eat spren,” Kal said flatly.\n“No,” she said, “we eat the roots.”\n“When we have to,” Tien added with a grimace.\n“And the spren?” Kal pressed.\n“They are freed. To return to wherever it is that spren live.”\n“Do I have a spren?” Tien said, looking down at his chest.\n“You have a soul, dear. You’re a person. But the pieces of your body\nmay very well have spren living in them. Very small ones.”"

Very small ones.”\nTien pinched at his skin, as if trying to pry the tiny spren out.\n“Dung,” Kal said suddenly.\n“Kal!” Hesina snapped. “That’s not talk for mealtime.”\n“Dung,” Kal said stubbornly. “It has spren?”\n“I suppose it does.”\n“Dungspren,” Tien said, then snickered.\nHis mother continued to chop. “Why all of these questions, suddenly?”\nKal shrugged. “I just—I don’t know. Because.”\nHe’d been thinking recently about the way the world worked, about\nwhat he was to do with his place in it. The other boys his age, they didn’t\nwonder about their place. Most knew what their future held. Working in the\nfields.\nKal had a choice, though. Over the last several months, he’d finally\nmade that choice. He would become a soldier. He was fifteen now, and\ncould volunteer when the next recruiter came through town. He planned to\ndo just that. No more wavering. He would learn to fight. That was the end\nof it. Wasn’t it?\n“I want to understand,” he said. “I just want everything to make\nsense.”\nHis mother smiled at that, standing in her brown work dress, hair\npulled back in a tail, the top hidden beneath her yellow kerchief.\n“What?” he demanded. “Why are you smiling?”\n“You just want everything to make sense?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well next time the ardents come through the town to burn prayers and\nElevate people’s Callings, I’ll pass the message along.” She smiled. “Until\nthen, keep peeling roots.”\nKal sighed, but did as she told him. He checked out the window again,\nand nearly dropped the root in shock. The carriage. It was coming down the\nroadway from the mansion. He felt a flutter of nervous hesitation. He’d\nplanned, he’d thought, but now that the time was upon him, he wanted to sit\nand keep peeling. There would be another opportunity, surely….\nNo. He stood, trying to keep the anxiety from his voice. “I’m going to\ngo rinse off.” He held up crem-covered fingers.\n“You should have washed the roots off first as I told you,” his mother\nnoted.\n“I know,” Kal said. Did his sigh of regret sound fake? “Maybe I’ll just\nwash them all off now.”\nHesina said nothing as he gathered up the remaining roots, crossed to\nthe door, heart thumping, and stepped out into the evening light.\n“See,” Tien said from behind, “from this side it’s green. I don’t think\nit’s a spren, Mother. It’s the light. It makes the rock change….”\nThe door swung closed. Kal set down the tubers and charged through\nthe streets of Hearthstone, passing men chopping wood, women throwing\nout dishwater, and a group of grandfathers sitting on steps and looking at\nthe sunset.

He ran around Mabrow Pigherder’s house, up past the\ncommonwater—the large hole cut into the rock at the center of the town to\ncatch rain—and along the breakwall, the steep hillside against which the\ntown was built to shield it from storms.\nHere, he found a small stand of stumpweight trees. Knobby and about\nas tall as a man, they grew leaves only on their leeward sides, running down\nthe length of the tree like rungs on a ladder, waving in the cool breeze. As\nKal got close, the large, bannerlike leaves snapped up close to the trunks,\nmaking a series of whipping sounds.\nKal’s father stood on the other side, hands clasped behind his back. He\nwas waiting where the road from the manor turned past Hearthstone. Lirin\nturned with a start, noticing Kal. He wore his finest clothing: a blue coat,\nbuttoning up the sides, like a lighteyes’s coat. But it was over a pair of\nwhite trousers that showed wear. He studied Kal through his spectacles.\n“I’m going with you,” Kal blurted. “Up to the mansion.”\n“How did you know?\n“Everyone knows,” Kal said. “You think they wouldn’t talk if\nBrightlord Roshone invited you to dinner? You, of all people?”\nLirin looked away. “I told your mother to keep you busy.”\n“She tried.” Kal grimaced. “I’ll probably hear a storm of it when she\nfinds those longroots sitting outside the front door.”\nLirin said nothing. The carriage rolled to a stop nearby, wheels\ngrinding against the stone.\n“This will not be a pleasant, idle meal, Kal,” Lirin said.\n“I’m not a fool, Father.” When Hesina had been told there was no\nmore need for her to work in the town…Well, there was a reason they’d\nbeen reduced to eating longroots. “If you’re going to confront him, then you\nshould have someone to support you.”\n“And that someone is you?”\n“I’m pretty much all you have.”\nThe coachman cleared his throat. He didn’t get down and open the\ndoor, the way he did for Brightlord Roshone.\nLirin eyed Kal.\n“If you send me back, I’ll go,” Kal said.\n“No. Come along if you must.” Lirin walked up to the carriage and\npulled open the door. It wasn’t the fancy, gold-trimmed vehicle that\nRoshone used. This was the second carriage, the older brown one. Kal\nclimbed in, feeling a surge of excitement at the small victory—and an equal\nmeasure of panic.\nThey were going to face Roshone. Finally.\nThe benches inside were amazing, the red cloth covering them softer\nthan anything Kal had ever felt. He sat down, and the seat was surprisingly\nspringy. Lirin sat across from Kal, pulling the door closed, and the\ncoachman snapped his whip at the horses. The vehicle turned around and\nrattled back up the road. As soft as the seat was, the ride was terribly\nbumpy, and it rattled Kal’s teeth against one another. It was worse than\nriding in a wagon, though that was probably because they were going faster.\n“Why didn’t you want us to know about this?” Kal asked."

He’d never thought of that. Suddenly everything\nseemed to expand. His future changed, wrapping upon itself, folding into a\nnew form entirely. Father, Mother, Tien…with him. “Really?”\nLirin nodded absently. “Even if we didn’t go to Kharbranth, I’m sure\nmany Alethi towns would welcome us. Most have never had a surgeon to\ncare for them. They do the best they can with local men who learned most\nof what they know from superstition or working on the occasional wounded\nchull. We could even move to Kholinar; I’m skilled enough to get work as a\nphysician’s assistant there.”\n“Why don’t we go, then? Why haven’t we gone?”\nLirin watched out the window. “I don’t know. We should leave. It\nmakes sense. We have the money. We aren’t wanted here. The citylord hates\nus, the people mistrust us, the Stormfather himself seems inclined to knock\nus down.” There was something in Lirin’s voice. Regret?\n“I tried very hard to leave once,” Lirin said, more softly. “But there’s a\ntie between a man’s home and his heart. I’ve cared for these people, Kal.\nDelivered their children, set their bones, healed their scrapes. You’ve seen\nthe worst of them, these last few years, but there was a time before that, a\ngood time.” He turned to Kal, clasping his hands in front of him, the\ncarriage rattling. “They’re mine, son. And I’m theirs. They’re my\nresponsibility, now that Wistiow has gone. I can’t leave them to Roshone.”\n“Even if they like what he’s doing?”\n“Particularly because of that.” Lirin raised a hand to his head.\n“Stormfather. It sounds more foolish now that I say it.”\n“No. I understand. I think.” Kal shrugged. “I guess, well, they still\ncome to us when they’re hurt. They complain about how unnatural it is to\ncut into a person, but they still come. I used to wonder why.”\n“And did you come to a conclusion?”\n“Kind of. I decided that in the end, they’d rather be alive to curse at\nyou a few more days. It’s what they do. Just like healing them is what you\ndo. And they used to give you money. A man can say all kinds of things, but\nwhere he sets his spheres, that’s where his heart is.” Kal frowned. “I guess\nthey did appreciate you.”\nLirin smiled. “Wise words. I keep forgetting that you’re nearly a man,\nKal. When did you go and grow up on me?”\nThat night when we were nearly robbed, Kal thought immediately.\nThat night when you shone light on the men outside, and showed that\nbravery had nothing to do with a spear held in battle."

But they still do. Oh, they grumble—they’ve\nalways done that. But they also leave food for us.”\nKal started. “They do?”\n“How do you think we’ve been eating these last four months?”\n“But—”\n“They’re frightened of Roshone, so they’re quiet about it. They left it\nfor your mother when she went to clean or put it in the rain barrel when it’s\nempty.”\n“They tried to rob us.”\n“And those very men were among the ones who gave us food as well.”\nKal pondered that as the carriage arrived at the manor house. It had\nbeen a long time since he’d visited the large, two-story building. It was\nconstructed with a standard roof that sloped toward the stormward side, but\nwas much larger. The walls were of thick white stones, and it had majestic\nsquare pillars on the leeward side.\nWould he see Laral here? He was embarrassed by how infrequently he\nthought about her these days.\nThe mansion’s front grounds had a low stone wall covered with all\nkinds of exotic plants. Rockbuds lined the top, their vines draping down the\noutside. Clusters of a bulbous variety of shalebark grew along the inside,\nbursting with a variety of bright colors. Oranges, reds, yellows, and blues.\nSome outcroppings looked like heaps of clothing, with folds spread like\nfans. Others grew out like horns. Most had tendrils like threads that waved\nin the wind. Brightlord Roshone paid much more attention to his grounds\nthan Wistiow had.\nThey walked up past the whitewashed pillars and entered between the\nthick wooden stormdoors. The vestibule inside had a low ceiling and was\ndecorated with ceramics; zircon spheres gave them a pale blue cast.\nA tall servant in a long black coat and a bright purple cravat greeted\nthem. He was Natir, the steward now that Miliv had died. He’d been\nbrought in from Dalilak, a large coastal city to the north.\nNatir led them to a dining room where Roshone sat at a long darkwood\ntable. He’d gained weight, though not enough to be called fat. He still had\nthat grey-flecked beard, and his hair was greased back down to his collar.\nHe wore white trousers and a tight red vest over a white shirt.\nHe’d already begun his meal, and the spicy scents made Kal’s stomach\nrumble. How long had it been since he’d had pork? There were five\ndifferent dipping sauces on the table, and Roshone’s wine was a deep,\ncrystalline orange. He ate alone, no sign of Laral or his son.\nThe servant gestured toward a side table set up in a room next to the\ndining hall. Kal’s father took one look at it, then walked to Roshone’s table\nand sat down. Roshone paused, skewer halfway to his lips, spicy brown\nsauce dripping to the table before him."

Roshone paused, skewer halfway to his lips, spicy brown\nsauce dripping to the table before him.\n“I’m of the second nahn,” Lirin said, “and I have a personal invitation\nto dine with you. Surely you follow the precepts of rank closely enough to\ngive me a place at your table.”\nRoshone clenched his teeth, but did not object. Taking a deep breath,\nKal sat down beside his father. Before he left to join the war on the\nShattered Plains, he had to know. Was his father a coward or a man of\ncourage?\nBy the light of spheres at home, Lirin had always seemed weak. He\nworked in his surgery room, ignoring what the townspeople said about him.\nHe told his son he couldn’t practice with the spear and forbade him to think\nof going to war. Weren’t those the actions of a coward? But five months\nago, Kal had seen courage in him that he’d never expected.\nAnd in the calm blue light of Roshone’s palace, Lirin met the eyes of a\nman far above him in rank, wealth, and power. And did not flinch. How did\nhe do it? Kal’s heart thumped uncontrollably. He had to put his hands in his\nlap to keep them from betraying his nervousness.\nRoshone waved to a serving man, and within a short time, new places\nhad been set. The periphery of the room was dark. Roshone’s table was an\nilluminated island amid a vast black expanse.\nThere were bowls of water for dipping one’s fingers and stiff white\ncloth napkins beside them. A lighteyes’ meal. Kal had rarely eaten such fine\nfood; he tried not to make a fool of himself as he hesitantly took a skewer\nand imitated Roshone, using his knife to slide down the bottommost chunk\nof meat, then raising it and biting. The meat was savory and tender, though\nthe spices were much hotter than he was accustomed to.\nLirin did not eat. He rested his elbows on the table, watching the\nBrightlord dine.\n“I wished to offer you the chance to eat in peace,” Roshone said\neventually, “before we talked of serious matters. But you don’t seem\ninclined to partake of my generosity.”\n“No.”\n“Very well,” Roshone said, taking a piece of flatbread from the basket\nand wrapping it around his skewer, pulling off several vegetable chunks at\nonce and eating them with the bread. “Then tell me. How long do you think\nyou can defy me? Your family is destitute.”\n“We do just fine,” Kal cut in.\nLirin glanced at him, but did not chastise him for speaking. “My son is\ncorrect. We can live. And if that doesn’t work, we can leave. I will not bend\nto your will, Roshone.”\n“If you left,” Roshone said, holding up a finger, “I would contact your\nnew citylord and tell him of the spheres stolen from me.”\n“I would win an inquest over that. Besides, as a surgeon, I am immune\nto most demands you could make.” It was true; men and their apprentices\nwho served an essential function in towns were afforded special protection,\neven from lighteyes.

The Vorin legal code of citizenship was complex\nenough that Kaladin still had difficulty understanding it.\n“Yes, you would win an inquest,” Roshone said. “You were so\nmeticulous, preparing the exact right documents. You were the only one\nwith Wistiow when he stamped them. Odd, that none of his clerks were\nthere.”\n“Those clerks read him the documents.”\n“And then left the room.”\n“Because they were ordered to leave by Brightlord Wistiow. They have\nadmitted this, I believe.”\nRoshone shrugged. “I don’t need to prove that you stole the spheres,\nsurgeon. I simply have to continue doing as I have been. I know that your\nfamily eats scraps. How long will you continue to make them suffer for\nyour pride?”\n“They won’t be intimidated. And neither will I.”\n“I’m not asking if you’re intimidated. I’m asking if you’re starving.”\n“Not by any means,” Lirin said, voice growing dry. “If we lack for\nsomething to eat, we can feast upon the attention you lavish upon us,\nBrightlord. We feel your eyes watching, hear your whispers to the\ntownspeople. Judging from the degree of your concern with us, it would\nseem that you are the one who is intimidated.”\nRoshone fell still, skewer held limply in his hand, brilliant green eyes\nnarrowed, lips pursed tight. In the dark, those eyes almost seemed to glow.\nKal had to stop himself from cringing under the weight of that disapproving\ngaze. There was an air of command about lighteyes like Roshone.\nHe’s not a real lighteyes! He’s a reject. I’ll see real ones eventually.\nMen of honor.\nLirin held the gaze evenly. “Every month we resist is a blow to your\nauthority. You can’t have me arrested, since I would win an inquest. You’ve\ntried to turn the other people against me, but they know—deep down—that\nthey need me.”\nRoshone leaned forward. “I do not like your little town.”\nLirin frowned at the odd response.\n“I do not like being treated like an exile,” Roshone continued. “I do not\nlike living so far from anything—everything—important. And most of all, I\ndo not like darkeyes who think themselves above their stations.”\n“I have trouble feeling sympathy for you.”\nRoshone sneered. He looked down at his meal, as if it had lost any\nflavor. “Very well. Let us make an…accommodation. I will take nine-tenths\nof the spheres. You can have the rest.”\nKal stood up indignantly. “My father will never—”\n“Kal,” Lirin cut in. “I can speak for myself.”\n“Surely you won’t make a deal, though.”\nLirin didn’t reply immediately. Finally, he said, “Go to the kitchens,\nKal. Ask them if they have some food more to your tastes.”\n“Father, no—”\n“Go, son.” Lirin’s voice was firm.\nWas it true?

        "text": "“Father, no—”\n“Go, son.” Lirin’s voice was firm.\nWas it true? After all of this, would his father simply capitulate? Kal\nfelt his face grow red, and he fled the dining room. He knew the way to the\nkitchens. During his childhood, he’d often dined there with Laral.\nHe left not because he was told to, but because he didn’t want his\nfather or Roshone to see his emotions: chagrin at having stood to denounce\nRoshone when his father planned to make a deal, humiliation that his father\nwould consider a deal, frustration at being banished. Kal was mortified to\nfind himself crying. He passed a couple of Roshone’s house soldiers\nstanding at the doorway, lit only by a very low-trimmed oil lamp on the\nwall. Their rough features were highlighted in amber hues.\nKal hastened past them, turning a corner before pausing beside a plant\nstand, struggling with his emotions. The stand displayed an indoor vine-\nbud, one bred to remain open; a few conelike flowers climbed up from its\nvestigial shell. The lamp on the wall above it burned with a tiny, strangled\nlight. These were the back rooms of the mansion, near the servant quarters,\nand spheres were not used for light here.\nKal leaned back, breathing in and out. He felt like one of the ten fools\n—specifically Cabine, who acted like a child though he was adult. But what\nwas he to think of Lirin’s actions?\nHe wiped his eyes, then pushed his way through the swinging doors\ninto the kitchens. Roshone still employed Wistiow’s chef. Barm was a tall,\nslender man with dark hair that he wore braided. He walked down the line\nof his kitchen counter, giving instructions to his various subchefs as a\ncouple of parshmen walked in and out through the mansion’s back doors,\ncarrying in crates of food. Barm carried a long metal spoon, which banged\non a pot or pan hanging from the ceiling each time he gave an order.\nHe barely spared Kal a brown-eyed glance, then told one of his\nservants to go fetch some flatbread and fruited tallew rice. A child’s meal.\nKal felt even more embarrassed that Barm had known instantly why he had\nbeen sent to the kitchens.\nKal walked to the dining nook to wait for the food. It was a\nwhitewashed alcove with a slate-topped table. He sat down, elbows on the\nstone, head on his hands.\nWhy did it make him so angry to think that his father might bargain\naway most of the spheres in exchange for safety? True, if that happened,\nthere wouldn’t be enough to send Kal to Kharbranth. But he’d already\ndecided to become a soldier. So it didn’t matter. Did it?\nI am going to join the army, Kal thought. I’ll run away, I’ll…\nSuddenly, that dream—that plan—seemed incredibly childish. It\nbelonged to a boy who ought to eat fruited meals and deserved to be sent\naway when the men talked of important topics. For the first time, the\nthought of not training with the surgeons filled him with regret.\nThe door into the kitchens banged open. Roshone’s son, Rillir,"

Roshone’s son, Rillir,\nsauntered in, chatting with the person behind him. “…don’t know why\nFather insists on keeping everything so dreary around here all the time. Oil\nlamps in the hallways? Could he be any more provincial? It would do him\nsome real good if I could get him out on a hunt or two. We might as well get\nsome use out of being in this remote place.”\nRillir noticed Kal sitting there, but passed over him as one might\nregister the presence of a stool or a shelf for wine: noting it, but otherwise\nignoring it.\nKal’s own eyes were on the person who followed Rillir. Laral.\nWistiow’s daughter.\nSo much had changed. It had been so long, and seeing her brought up\nold emotions. Shame, excitement. Did she know that his parents had been\nhoping to marry him to her? Merely seeing her again almost flustered him\ncompletely. But no. His father could look Roshone in the eyes. He could do\nthe same with her.\nKal stood up and nodded to her. She glanced at him, and blushed\nfaintly, walking in with an old nurse in tow—a chaperone.\nWhat had happened to the Laral he’d known, the girl with the loose\nyellow and black hair who liked climbing on rocks and running through\nfields? Now she was wrapped up in sleek yellow silk, a stylish lighteyed\nwoman’s dress, her neatly coiffed hair dyed black to hide the blond. Her left\nhand was hidden modestly in her sleeve. Laral looked like a lighteyes.\nWistiow’s wealth—what was left of it—had gone to her. And when\nRoshone had been given authority over Hearthstone and granted the\nmansion and surrounding lands, Highprince Sadeas had given Laral a\ndowry in compensation.\n“You,” Rillir said, nodding to Kal and speaking in a smooth, city\naccent. “Be a good lad and fetch us some supper. We’ll take it here in the\nnook.”\n“I’m not a kitchen servant.”\n“So?”\nKal flushed.\n“If you’re expecting some kind of tip or reward for just fetching me a\nmeal…”\n“I’m not—I mean—” Kal looked to Laral. “Tell him, Laral.”\nShe looked away. “Well, go on, boy,” she said. “Do as you’re told.\nWe’re hungry.”\nKal gaped at her, then felt his face redden even more. “I’m…I’m not\ngoing to fetch you anything!” he managed to say. “I wouldn’t do it no\nmatter how many spheres you offer me. I’m not an errand boy, I’m a\nsurgeon.”\n“Oh, you’re that one’s son.”\n“I am,” Kal said, surprised at how proudly he felt those words. “I’m\nnot going to be bullied by you, Rillir Roshone.

It’s just not my Calling.”\n“Then what is your Calling?”\n“Making sick people well.”\n“And if I don’t eat, won’t I be sick? So couldn’t you call it your duty to\nsee me fed?”\nKal frowned. “It’s…well, it’s not the same thing at all.”\n“I see it as being very similar.”\n“Look, why don’t you just go get yourself some food?”\n“It’s not my Calling.”\n“Then what is your Calling?” Kal returned, throwing the man’s own\nwords back at him.\n“I’m cityheir,” Rillir said. “My duty is to lead—to see that jobs get\ndone and that people are occupied in productive work. And as such, I give\nimportant tasks to idling darkeyes to make them useful.”\nKal hesitated, growing angry.\n“You see how his little mind works,” Rillir said to Laral. “Like a dying\nfire, burning what little fuel it has, pumping out smoke. Ah, and look, his\nface grows red from the heat of it.”\n“Rillir, please,” Laral said, laying her hand on his arm.\nRillir glanced at her, then rolled his eyes. “You’re as provincial as my\nfather sometimes, dear.” He stood up straight and—with a look of\nresignation—led her past the nook and into the kitchen proper.\nKal sat back down hard, nearly bruising his legs on the bench with the\nforce of it. A serving boy brought him his food and set it on the table, but\nthat only reminded Kal of his childishness. So he didn’t eat it; he just stared\nat it until, eventually, his father walked into the kitchen. Rillir and Laral\nwere gone by then.\nLirin walked to the alcove and surveyed Kal. “You didn’t eat.”\nKal shook his head.\n“You should have. It was free. Come on.”\nThey walked in silence from the mansion into the dark night. The\ncarriage awaited them, and soon Kal again sat facing his father. The driver\nclimbed into place, making the vehicle quiver, and a snap of his whip set\nthe horses in motion.\n“I want to be a surgeon,” Kal said suddenly.\nHis father’s face—hidden in shadow—was unreadable. But when he\nspoke, he sounded confused. “I know that, son.”\n“No. I want to be a surgeon. I don’t want to run away to join the war.”\nSilence in the darkness.\n“You were considering that?” Lirin asked.\n“Yes,” Kal admitted. “It was childish. But I’ve decided for myself that\nI want to learn surgery instead.”\n“Why? What made you change?”\n“I need to know how they think,” Kal said, nodding back toward the\nmansion. “They’re trained to speak their sentences in knots, and I have to\nbe able to face them and talk back at them. Not fold like…” He hesitated."

Not fold like…” He hesitated.\n“Like I did?” Lirin asked with a sigh.\nKal bit his lip, but had to ask. “How many spheres did you agree to\ngive him? Will I still have enough to go to Kharbranth?”\n“I didn’t give him a thing.”\n“But—”\n“Roshone and I talked for a time, arguing over amounts. I pretended to\ngrow hotheaded and left.”\n“Pretended?” Kal asked, confused.\nHis father leaned forward, whispering to make certain the driver\ncouldn’t hear. With the bouncing and the noise of the wheels on the stone,\nthere was little danger of that. “He has to think that I’m willing to bend.\nToday’s meeting was about giving the appearance of desperation. A strong\nfront at first, followed by frustration, letting him think that he’d gotten to\nme. Finally a retreat. He’ll invite me again in a few months, after letting me\n‘sweat.’”\n“But you won’t bend then, either?” Kal whispered.\n“No. Giving him any of the spheres would make him greedy for the\nrest. These lands don’t produce as they used to, and Roshone is nearly\nbroke from losing political battles. I still don’t know which highlord was\nbehind sending him here to torment us, though I wish I had him for a few\nmoments in a dark room….”\nThe ferocity with which Lirin said that shocked Kal. It was the closest\nhe’d ever heard his father come to threatening real violence.\n“But why go through this in the first place?” Kal whispered. “You said\nthat we can keep resisting him. Mother thinks so too. We won’t eat well, but\nwe won’t starve.”\nHis father didn’t reply, though he looked troubled.\n“You need to make him think that we’re capitulating,” Kal said. “Or\nthat we’re close to doing so. So that he’ll stop looking for ways to\nundermine us? So he’ll focus his attention on making a deal and not—”\nKal froze. He saw something unfamiliar in his father’s eyes.\nSomething like guilt. Suddenly it made sense. Cold, terrible sense.\n“Stormfather,” Kal whispered. “You did steal the spheres, didn’t you?”\nHis father remained silent, riding in the old carriage, shadowed and\nblack.\n“That’s why you’ve been so tense since Wistiow died,” Kal whispered.\n“The drinking, the worrying…You’re a thief! We’re a family of thieves.”\nThe carriage turned, and the violet light of Salas illuminated Lirin’s\nface. He didn’t look half so ominous from that angle—in fact, he looked\nfragile. He clasped his hands before him, eyes reflecting moonlight.\n“Wistiow was not lucid during the final days, Kal,” he whispered. “I knew\nthat, with his death, we would lose the promise of a union. Laral had not\nreached her day of majority, and the new citylord wouldn’t let a darkeyes\ntake her inheritance through marriage.”\n“So you robbed him?” Kal felt himself shrinking.\n“I made certain that promises were kept. I had to do something. I"

I\ncouldn’t trust to the generosity of the new citylord. Wisely, as you can see.”\nAll of this time, Kal had assumed that Roshone was persecuting them\nout of malice and spite. But it turned out he was justified. “I can’t believe\nit.”\n“Does it change so much?” Lirin whispered. His face looked haunted\nin the dim light. “What is different now?”\n“Everything.”\n“And yet nothing. Roshone still wants those spheres, and we still\ndeserve them. Wistiow, if he’d been fully lucid, would have given us those\nspheres. I’m certain.”\n“But he didn’t.”\n“No.”\nThings were the same, yet different. One step, and the world flipped\nupside down. The villain became the hero, the hero the villain. “I—” Kal\nsaid. “I can’t decide if what you did was incredibly brave or incredibly\nwrong.”\nLirin sighed. “I know how you feel.” He sat back. “Please, don’t tell\nTien what we’ve done.” What we’ve done. Hesina had helped him. “When\nyou are older, you’ll understand.”\n“Maybe,” Kal said, shaking his head. “But one thing hasn’t changed. I\nwant to go to Kharbranth.”\n“Even on stolen spheres?”\n“I’ll find a way to pay them back. Not to Roshone. To Laral.”\n“She’ll be a Roshone before too long,” Lirin said. “We should expect\nan engagement between her and Rillir before the year is out. Roshone will\nnot let her slip away, not now that he’s lost political favor in Kholinar. She\nrepresents one of the few chances his son has for an alliance with a good\nhouse.”\nKal felt his stomach turn at the mention of Laral. “I have to learn.\nPerhaps I can…”\nCan what, he thought. Come back and convince her to leave Rillir for\nme? Ridiculous.\nHe looked up suddenly at his father, who had bowed his head, looking\nsorrowful. He was a hero. A villain too. But a hero to his family. “I won’t\ntell Tien,” Kal whispered. “And I’m going to use the spheres to travel to\nKholinar and study.”\nHis father looked up.\n“I want to learn to face lighteyes, like you do,” Kal said. “Any of them\ncan make a fool of me. I want to learn to talk like them, think like them.”\n“I want you to learn so that you can help people, son. Not so you can\nget back at the lighteyes.”\n“I think I can do both. If I can learn to be clever enough.”\nLirin snorted. “You’re plenty clever, son. You’ve got enough of your\nmother in you to talk circles around a lighteyes. The university will show\nyou how, Kal.”\n“I want to start going by my full name,” he replied, surprising himself.\n“Kaladin.” It was a man’s name. He’d always disliked how it sounded like\nthe name of a lighteyes. Now it seemed to fit."

They had been allowed to cut\nKaladin down, and so far nobody had tried to stop them from caring for\nhim. Practically the entire army had heard Sadeas give Kaladin to the\nStormfather for judgment.\nGaz had come to see Kaladin, then had snorted to himself in\namusement. He’d likely told his superiors that Kaladin would die. Men\ndidn’t live long with wounds like those.\nYet Kaladin hung on. Soldiers were going out of their way to try to get\na peek at him. His survival was incredible. People were talking in camp.\nGiven to the Stormfather for judgment, then spared. A miracle. Sadeas\nwouldn’t like that. How long would it be before one of the lighteyes\ndecided to relieve their brightlord of the problem? Sadeas couldn’t take any\novert action—not without losing a great deal of credibility—but a quiet\npoisoning or suffocation would abbreviate the embarrassment.\nSo Bridge Four kept Kaladin as far from outside eyes as possible. And\nthey always left someone with him. Always.\nStorming man, Teft thought, kneeling beside the feverish patient in his\ntousled blankets, eyes closed, face sweaty, body bound with a frightful\nnumber of bandages. Most were stained red. They didn’t have the money to\nchange them often.\nSkar kept watch currently. The short, strong-faced man sat at Kaladin’s\nfeet.\n“How is he?” Teft asked.\nSkar spoke softly. “He seems to be getting worse, Teft. I heard him\nmumble about dark shapes, thrashing and telling them to keep back. He\nopened his eyes. He didn’t seem to see me, but he saw something. I swear\nit.”\nDeathspren, Teft thought, feeling a chill. Kelek preserve us.\n“I’ll take a turn,” Teft said, sitting. “You go get something to eat.”\nSkar stood, looking pale. It would crush the others’ spirit for Kaladin\nto survive the highstorm, then die of his wounds. Skar shuffled from the\nroom, shoulders slumped.\nTeft watched Kaladin for a long while, trying to gather his thoughts,\nhis emotions. “Why now?” he whispered. “Why here? After so many have\nwatched and waited, you come here?”\nBut of course, Teft was getting ahead of himself. He didn’t know for\ncertain. He only had assumptions and hopes. No, not hopes—fears. He had\nrejected the Envisagers. And yet, here he was. He fished in his pocket and\npulled out three small diamond spheres. It had been a long, long while since\nhe’d saved anything of his wages, but he’d held on to these, thinking,\nworrying. They glowed with Stormlight in his hand.\nDid he really want to know?\nGritting his teeth, Teft moved closer to Kaladin’s side, looking down at\nthe unconscious man’s face. “You bastard,” he whispered. “You storming\nbastard. You took a bunch of hanged men and lifted them up just enough to\nbreathe. Now you’re going to leave them? I won’t have it, you hear. I\nwon’t.”"

All the Envisagers had were stories\nand legends. Fool’s tales, Teft had called them. Idle dreams.\nHe waited. Of course, nothing happened. You’re as big a fool as any,\nTeft, he told himself. He reached for Kaladin’s hand. Those spheres would\nbuy a few drinks.\nKaladin gasped suddenly, drawing in a short, quick, powerful breath.\nThe glow in his hand faded.\nTeft froze, eyes widening. Wisps of Light began to rise from Kaladin’s\nbody. It was faint, but there was no mistaking that glowing white Stormlight\nstreaming off his frame. It was as if Kaladin had been bathed in sudden\nheat, and his very skin steamed.\nKaladin’s eyes snapped open, and they leaked light too, faintly colored\namber. He gasped again loudly, and the trailing wisps of light began to twist\naround the exposed cuts on his chest. A few of them pulled together and\nknit themselves up.\nThen it was gone, the Light of those tiny chips expended. Kaladin’s\neyes closed and he relaxed. His wounds were still bad, his fever still raging,\nbut some color had returned to his skin. The puffy redness around several\ncuts had diminished.\n“My God,” Teft said, realizing he was trembling. “Almighty, cast from\nheaven to dwell in our hearts…It is true.” He bowed his head to the rock\nfloor, squeezing his eyes shut, tears leaking from their corners.\nWhy now? he thought again. Why here?\nAnd, in the name of all heaven, why me?\nHe knelt for a hundred heartbeats, counting, thinking, worrying.\nEventually, he pulled himself to his feet and retrieved the spheres—now\ndun—from Kaladin’s hand. He’d need to trade them for spheres with Light\nin them. Then he could return and let Kaladin drain those as well.\nHe’d have to be careful. A few spheres each day, but not too many. If\nthe boy healed too quickly, it would draw too much attention.\nAnd I need to tell the Envisagers, he thought. I need to…\nThe Envisagers were gone. Dead, because of what he had done. If\nthere were others, he had no idea how to locate them.\nWho would he tell? Who would believe him? Kaladin himself\nprobably didn’t understand what he was doing.\nBest to keep it quiet, at least until he could figure out what to do about\nit.\n“Within a heartbeat, Alezarv was there, crossing a distance that would\nhave taken more than four months to travel by foot.”\n—Another folktale, this one recorded in Among the Darkeyed, by\nCalinam.

Thick lines first, like\ntrails of blood left by a thumb drawn across rough granite. Tiny lines like\nscratches made by a pin.\nShe sat in her closetlike stone chamber in the Conclave. No windows,\nno ornamentation on the granite walls. Just the bed, her trunk, the\nnightstand, and the small desk that doubled as a drawing table.\nA single ruby broam cast a bloody light on her sketch. Usually, to\nproduce a vibrant drawing, she had to consciously memorize a scene. A\nblink, freezing the world, imprinting it into her mind. She hadn’t done that\nduring Jasnah’s annihilation of the thieves. She’d been too frozen by horror\nor morbid fascination.\nDespite that, she could see each of those scenes in her mind just as\nvividly as if she’d deliberately memorized them. And these memories didn’t\nvanish when she drew them. She couldn’t rid her mind of them. Those\ndeaths were burned into her.\nShe sat back from her drawing board, hand shaking, the picture before\nher an exact charcoal representation of the suffocating nightscape, squeezed\nbetween alley walls, a tortured figure of flame rising toward the sky. At that\nmoment, its face still held its shape, shadow eyes wide and burning lips\nagape. Jasnah’s hand was toward the figure, as if warding, or worshipping.\nShallan drew her charcoal-stained fingers to her chest, staring at her\ncreation. It was one of dozens of drawings she’d done during the last few\ndays. The man turned into fire, the other frozen into crystal, the two\ntransmuted to smoke. She could only draw one of those two fully; she’d\nbeen facing down the alleyway to the east. Her drawings of the fourth\nman’s death were of smoke rising, clothing already on the ground.\nShe felt guilty for being unable to record his death. And she felt stupid\nfor that guilt.\nLogic did not condemn Jasnah. Yes, the princess had gone willingly\ninto danger, but that didn’t remove responsibility from those who had\nchosen to hurt her. The men’s actions were reprehensible. Shallan had spent\nthe days poring through books on philosophy, and most ethical frameworks\nexonerated the princess.\nBut Shallan had been there. She’d watched those men die. She’d seen\nthe terror in their eyes, and she felt terrible. Hadn’t there been another way?\nKill or be killed. That was the Philosophy of Starkness. It exonerated\nJasnah.\nActions are not evil. Intent is evil, and Jasnah’s intent had been to stop\nmen from harming others. That was the Philosophy of Purpose. It lauded\nJasnah.\nMorality is separate from the ideals of men. It exists whole\nsomewhere, to be approached—but never truly understood—by the mortal.\nThe Philosophy of Ideals. It claimed that removing evil was ultimately\nmoral, and so in destroying evil men, Jasnah was justified.\nObjective must be weighed against methods. If the goal is worthy, then\nthe steps taken are worthwhile, even if some of them—on their own—are\nreprehensible. The Philosophy of Aspiration. It, more than any, called\nJasnah’s actions ethical."

Her fingers moved again,\nclutching the charcoal pencil, beginning a new picture on the blank sheet\nstrapped in place on the table, unable to escape.\nHer theft nagged at her as much as the killings did. Ironically, Jasnah’s\ndemand that Shallan study moralistic philosophy forced her to contemplate\nher own, terrible actions. She’d come to Kharbranth to steal the fabrial, then\nuse it to save her brothers and their house from massive debt and\ndestruction. Yet in the end, this wasn’t why Shallan had stolen the\nSoulcaster. She’d taken it because she was angry with Jasnah.\nIf the intentions were more important than the action, then she had to\ncondemn herself. Perhaps the Philosophy of Aspiration—which stated that\nobjectives were more important than the steps taken to achieve them—\nwould agree with what she’d done, but that was the philosophy she found\nmost reprehensible. Shallan sat here sketching, condemning Jasnah. But\nShallan was the one who had betrayed a woman who had trusted her and\ntaken her in. Now she was planning to commit heresy with the Soulcaster\nby using it although she was not an ardent.\nThe Soulcaster itself lay in the hidden part of Shallan’s trunk. Three\ndays, and Jasnah had said nothing about the disappearance. She wore the\nfake each day. She said nothing, acted no differently. Maybe she hadn’t\ntried Soulcasting. Almighty send that she didn’t go out and put herself into\ndanger again, expecting to be able to use the fabrial to kill men who\nattacked her.\nOf course, there was one other aspect of that night that Shallan had to\nthink of. She carried a concealed weapon that she hadn’t used. She felt\nfoolish for not even thinking of getting it out that night. But she wasn’t\naccustomed to—\nShallan froze, realizing for the first time what she’d been drawing. Not\nanother scene from the alleyway, but a lavish room with a thick,\nornamented rug and swords on the walls. A long dining table, set with a\nhalf-eaten meal.\nAnd a dead man in fine clothing, lying face-first on the floor, blood\npooling around him. She jumped back, tossing aside the charcoal, then\ncrumpled up the paper. Shaking, she moved over and sat down on the bed\namong the pictures. Dropping the crumpled drawing, she raised her fingers\nto her forehead, feeling the cold sweat there.\nSomething was wrong with her, with her drawings.\nShe had to get out. Escape the death, the philosophy and the questions.\nShe stood and hurriedly strode into the main room of Jasnah’s quarters. The\nprincess herself was away researching, as always. She hadn’t demanded that\nShallan come to the Veil today. Was that because she realized that her ward\nneeded time to think alone?

But one of your spanreeds is\nflashing.” The woman held up the reed, affixed on the side with a small\nblinking ruby.\nShallan breathed in and out, stilling her heart. “Thank you,” she said.\nShe, like Jasnah, left her spanreeds in the care of servants because she\nwas often away from her rooms, and was likely to miss any attempt to\ncontact her.\nStill flustered, she was tempted to leave the thing and continue on her\nway.

It was a code phrase,\nmeant to indicate to her that it was indeed Nan Balat—or, at least, his\nbetrothed—on the other side.\nMy back hurts and my wrist itches, she wrote back, giving the other\nhalf of the code phrase.\nI’m sorry I missed your other communications, Nan Balat sent. I had\nto attend a feast in Father’s name. It was with Sur Kamar, so it wasn’t really\nsomething I could miss, despite the day of traveling each way.\nIt’s all right, Shallan wrote. She took a deep breath. I have the item.\nShe turned the gem.\nThe reed was still for a long moment. Finally, a hurried hand wrote,\nPraise the Heralds. Oh, Shallan. You’ve done it! You are on your way back\nto us, then? How can you use the spanreed on the ocean? Are you in port?\nI haven’t left, Shallan wrote.\nWhat? Why?\nBecause it would be too suspicious, she wrote. Think about it, Nan\nBalat. If Jasnah tries the item and finds it broken, she might not\nimmediately decide that she’s been had. That changes if I’ve suddenly and\nsuspiciously left for home.\nI have to wait until she’s made the discovery, then see what she does\nnext. If she realizes that her fabrial was replaced with a fake, then I can\ndeflect her toward other culprits. She’s already suspicious of the ardentia. If\n—on the other hand—she assumes that her fabrial has broken somehow, I’ll\nknow we’re free.\nShe twisted the gem, setting the spanreed in place.\nThe question she’d been expecting came next. And if she immediately\nassumes that you did it? Shallan, what if you can’t deflect her suspicion?\nWhat if she orders a search of your chambers and they find the hidden"

Shallan, what if you can’t deflect her suspicion?\nWhat if she orders a search of your chambers and they find the hidden\ncompartment?\nShe picked up the pen. Then it is still better for me to be here, she\nwrote. Balat, I have learned much about Jasnah Kholin. She is incredibly\nfocused and determined. She will not let me escape if she thinks I have\nrobbed her. She will hunt me down, and will use all of her resources to exact\nretribution. We’d have our own king and highprinces on our property in\ndays, demanding that we turn over the fabrial. Stormfather! I’ll bet Jasnah\nhas contacts in Jah Keved that she could reach before I got back. I’d find\nmyself in custody the moment I landed.\nOur only hope is to deflect her. If that doesn’t work, better for me to be\nhere and suffer her wrath quickly. Likely she would take the Soulcaster and\nbanish me from her sight. If we make her work and chase after me,\nthough…She can be very ruthless, Balat. It would not go well for us.\nThe response was long in coming. When did you get so good at logic,\nsmall one? he finally sent. I see that you’ve thought this through. Better\nthan I have, at least. But Shallan, our time is running out.\nI know, she wrote. You said you could hold things together for a few\nmore months. I ask you to do that. Give me two or three weeks, at least, to\nsee what Jasnah does. Besides, while I am here, I can look into how the\nthing works. I haven’t found any books that give hints, but there are so many\nhere, maybe I just haven’t found the right one yet.\nVery well, he wrote. A few weeks. Be careful, small one. The men who\ngave Father his fabrial visited again. They asked after you. I’m worried\nabout them. Even more than I worry about our finances. They disturb me in\na profound way. Farewell.\nFarewell, she wrote back.\nSo far, there had been no hint of reaction from the princess. She hadn’t\neven mentioned the Soulcaster. That made Shallan nervous. She wished that\nJasnah would just say something. The waiting was excruciating. Each day,\nwhile she sat with Jasnah, Shallan’s stomach churned with anxiety until she\nwas nauseated. At least—considering the killings a few days ago—Shallan\nhad a very good excuse for looking disturbed.\nCold, calm logic. Jasnah herself would be proud.\nA knock came at the door, and Shallan quickly gathered up the\nconversation she’d had with Nan Balat and burned it in the hearth. A palace\nmaid entered a moment later, carrying a basket in the crook of her arm. She\nsmiled at Shallan. It was time for the daily cleaning.\nShallan had a strange moment of panic at seeing the woman. She\nwasn’t one of the maids Shallan recognized. What if Jasnah had sent her or\nsomeone else to search Shallan’s room? Had she done so already? Shallan\nnodded to the woman and then—to assuage her worries—she walked to her"

She rushed to the chest and checked the hidden\ncompartment. The fabrial was there. She lifted it out, inspecting it. Would\nshe know if Jasnah somehow reversed the exchange?\nYou’re being foolish, she told herself. Jasnah’s subtle, but she’s not that\nsubtle. Still, Shallan stuffed the Soulcaster in her safepouch. It just barely fit\ninside the envelope-like cloth container. She’d feel safer knowing she had it\non her while the maid cleaned her room. Besides, the safepouch might be a\nbetter hiding place for it than her trunk.\nBy tradition, a woman’s safepouch was where she kept items of\nintimate or very precious import. To search one would be like strip-\nsearching her—considering her rank, either would be virtually unthinkable\nunless she were obviously implicated in a crime. Jasnah could probably\nforce it. But if Jasnah could do that, she could order a search of Shallan’s\nroom, and her trunk would be under particular scrutiny. The truth was, if\nJasnah chose to suspect her, there would be little Shallan could do to hide\nthe fabrial. So the safepouch was as good a place as any.\nShe gathered up the pictures she’d drawn and put them upside-down\non the desk, trying not to look at them. She didn’t want those to be seen by\nthe maid. Finally, she left, taking her portfolio. She felt that she needed to\nget outside and escape for a while. Draw something other than death and\nmurder. The conversation with Nan Balat had only served to upset her\nmore.\n“Brightness?” the maid asked.\nShallan froze, but the maid held up a basket. “This was dropped off for\nyou with the master-servants.”\nShe hesitantly accepted it, looking inside. Bread and jam. A note, tied\nto one of the jars, read: Bluebar jam. If you like it, it means you’re\nmysterious, reserved, and thoughtful. It was signed Kabsal.\nShallan placed the basket’s handle in the crook of her safearm’s elbow.\nKabsal. Maybe she should go find him. She always felt better after a\nconversation with him.\nBut no. She was going to leave; she couldn’t keep stringing him, or\nherself, along. She was afraid of where the relationship was going. Instead,\nshe made her way to the main cavern and then to the Conclave’s exit. She\nwalked out into the sunlight and took a deep breath, looking up into the sky\nas servants and attendants parted around her, swarming in and out of the\nConclave. She held her portfolio close, feeling the cool breeze on her\ncheeks and the contrasting warmth of the sunlight pressing down on\nher hair and forehead.\nIn the end, the most disturbing part was that Jasnah had been right.\nShallan’s world of simple answers had been a foolish, childish place. She’d\nclung to the hope that she could find truth, and use it to explain—perhaps\njustify—what she had done back in Jah Keved. But if there was such a thing"

But if there was such a thing\nas truth, it was far more complicated and murky than she’d assumed.\nSome problems didn’t seem to have any good answers. Just a lot of\nwrong ones. She could choose the source of her guilt, but she couldn’t\nchoose to be rid of that guilt entirely.\nTwo hours—and about twenty quick sketches—later, Shallan felt far more\nrelaxed.\nShe sat in the palace gardens, sketchpad in her lap, drawing snails. The\ngardens weren’t as extensive as her father’s, but they were far more varied,\nnot to mention blessedly secluded. Like many modern gardens, they were\ndesigned with walls of cultivated shalebark. This one’s made a maze of\nliving stone. They were short enough that, when standing, she could see the\nway back to the entrance. But if she sat down on one of the numerous\nbenches, she could feel alone and unseen.\nShe’d asked a groundskeeper the name of the most prominent\nshalebark plant; he’d called it “plated stone.” A fitting name, as it grew in\nthin round sections that piled atop one another, like plates in a cupboard.\nFrom the sides, it looked like weathered rock that exposed hundreds of thin\nstrata. Tiny little tendrils grew up out of pores, waving in the wind. The\nstonelike casings had a bluish shade, but the tendrils were yellowish.\nHer current subject was a snail with a low horizontal shell edged with\nlittle ridges. When she tapped, it would flatten itself into a rift in the\nshalebark, appearing to become part of the plated stone. It blended in\nperfectly. When she let it move, it nibbled at the shalebark—but didn’t\nchew it away.\nIt’s cleaning the shalebark, she realized, continuing her sketch. Eating\noff the lichen and mold. Indeed, a cleaner trail extended behind it.\nPatches of a different kind of shalebark—with fingerlike protrusions\ngrowing up into the air from a central knob—grew alongside the plated\nstone. When she looked closely, she noted little cremlings—thin and\nmultilegged—crawling along it, eating at it. Were they too cleaning it?\nCurious, she thought, beginning a sketch of the miniature cremlings.\nThey had carapaces shaded like the shalebark’s fingers, while the snail’s\nshell was a near duplicate of the yellow and blue colorings of the plated\nstone. It was as if they had been designed by the Almighty in pairs, the plant\ngiving safety to the animal, the animal cleaning the plant.\nA few lifespren—tiny, glowing green specks—floated around the\nshalebark mounds. Some danced amid the rifts in the bark, others in the air\nlike dust motes zigzagging up, only to fall again.\nShe used a finer-tipped charcoal pencil to scribble some thoughts about\nthe relationship between the animals and the plants. She didn’t know of any\nbooks that spoke of relationships like this one. Scholars seemed to prefer\nstudying big, dynamic animals, like greatshells or whitespines. But this\nseemed a beautiful, wondrous discovery to Shallan."

But this\nseemed a beautiful, wondrous discovery to Shallan.\nSnails and plants can help one another, she thought. But I betray\nJasnah.\nShe glanced toward her safehand, and the pouch hidden inside. She felt\nmore secure having the Soulcaster near. She hadn’t yet dared try to use it.\nShe’d been too nervous about the theft, and had worried about using the\nobject near Jasnah. Now, however, she was in a nook deep within the maze,\nwith only one curving entrance into her dead end. She stood up casually,\nlooking around. No one else was in the gardens, and she was far enough\ninside that it would take minutes for anyone to get to her.\nShallan sat back down, setting aside her drawing pad and pencil. I\nmight as well see if I can figure out how to use it, she thought. Maybe\nthere’s no need to keep searching the Palanaeum for a solution. So long as\nshe stood up and glanced about periodically, she could be certain she\nwouldn’t be approached or seen by accident.\nShe removed the forbidden device. It was heavy in her hand. Solid.\nTaking a deep breath, she looped the chains over her fingers and around her\nwrist, the gemstones set against the back of her hand. The metal was cold,\nthe chains loose. She flexed her hand, pulling the fabrial tight.\nShe’d anticipated a feeling of power. Prickles on her skin, perhaps, or a\nsense of strength and might. But there was nothing.\nShe tapped the three gemstones—she’d placed her smokestone into the\nthird setting. Some other fabrials, like spanreeds, worked when you tapped\nthe stones. But that was foolish, as she’d never seen Jasnah do that. The\nwoman just closed her eyes and touched something, Soulcasting it. Smoke,\ncrystal, and fire were what this Soulcaster was best at. Only once had she\nseen Jasnah create anything else.\nHesitant, Shallan took a piece of broken shalebark from the base of\none of the plants. She held it up in her freehand, then closed her eyes.\nBecome smoke! she commanded.\nNothing happened.\nBecome crystal! she commanded instead.\nShe cracked an eye. There was no change.\nFire. Burn! You’re fire! You—\nShe paused, realizing the stupidity of that. A mysteriously burned\nhand? No, that wouldn’t be at all suspicious. Instead, she focused on\ncrystal. She closed her eyes again, holding the image of a piece of quartz in\nher mind. She tried to will the shalebark to change.\nNothing happened, so she just tried focusing, imagining the shalebark\ntransforming. After a few minutes of failure, she tried making the pouch\nchange instead, then tried the bench, then tried one of her hairs. Nothing\nworked.\nShallan checked to make certain she was still alone, then sat down,\nfrustrated. Nan Balat had asked Luesh how the devices worked, and he’d\nsaid that it was easier to show than explain. He’d promised to give them\nanswers if she actually managed to steal Jasnah’s.\nNow he was dead. Was she doomed to carry this one back to her"

Was she doomed to carry this one back to her\nfamily, only to immediately give it away to those dangerous men, never\nusing it to gain wealth to protect her house? All because they didn’t know\nhow to activate it?\nThe other fabrials she’d used had been simple to activate, but those\nwere constructed by contemporary artifabrians. Soulcasters were fabrials\nfrom ancient times. They wouldn’t employ modern methods of activation.\nShe stared at the glowing gemstones suspended on the back of her hand.\nHow would she figure out the method of using a tool thousands of years\nold, one forbidden to any but ardents?\nShe slid the Soulcaster back into her safepouch. It seemed she was\nback to searching the Palanaeum. That or asking Kabsal. But would she\nmanage that without looking suspicious? She broke out his bread and jam,\neating and thinking idly. If Kabsal didn’t know, and if she couldn’t find the\nanswers by the time she left Kharbranth, were there other options? If she\ntook the artifact to the Veden king—or maybe the ardents—might they be\nable to protect her family in exchange for the gift? After all, she couldn’t\nreally be blamed for stealing from a heretic, and so long as Jasnah didn’t\nknow who had the Soulcaster, they would be safe.\nFor some reason, that made her feel even worse. Stealing the\nSoulcaster to save her family was one thing, but turning it over to the very\nardents whom Jasnah disdained? It seemed a greater betrayal.\nYet another difficult decision. Well then, she thought, it’s a good thing\nJasnah is so determined to train me in how to deal with those. By the time\nall this is done, I should be quite the expert….\n“Death upon the lips. Sound upon the air. Char upon the skin.”\n—From “The Last Desolation” by Ambrian, line 335.\nKaladin stumbled into the light, shading his eyes against the burning sun,\nhis bare feet feeling the transition from cold indoor stone to sun-warmed\nstone outside. The air was lightly humid, not muggy as it had been in\nprevious weeks.\nHe rested his hand on the wooden doorframe, his legs quivering\nrebelliously, his arms feeling as if he’d carried a bridge for three days\nstraight. He breathed deeply. His side should have blazed with pain, but he\nfelt only a residual soreness. Some of his deeper cuts were still scabbed\nover, but the smaller ones had vanished completely. His head was\nsurprisingly clear. He didn’t even have a headache.\nHe rounded the side of the barrack, feeling stronger with each step,\nthough he kept his hand on the wall. Lopen followed behind; the Herdazian\nhad been watching over Kaladin when he awoke.\nI should be dead, Kaladin thought. What is going on?\nOn the other side of the barrack he was surprised to find the men\ncarrying their bridge in daily practice.

They reached the other side of\nthe lumberyard and turned around, charging back. Only when they were\nalmost past the barrack did one of the men in front—Moash—notice\nKaladin. He froze, nearly causing the entire bridge crew to trip.\n“What is wrong with you?” Torfin yelled from behind, head enveloped\nby the wood of the bridge.\nMoash didn’t listen. He ducked out from under the bridge, looking at\nKaladin with wide eyes. Rock gave a hasty shout for the men to put down\nthe bridge. More saw him, adopting the same reverent expressions as\nMoash. Hobber and Peet, their wounds sufficiently healed, had started\npracticing with the others. That was good. They’d be drawing pay again.\nThe men walked up to Kaladin, silent in their leather vests. They kept\ntheir distance, hesitant, as if he were fragile. Or holy. Kaladin was bare-\nchested, his nearly healed wounds exposed, and wore only his knee-length\nbridgeman’s trousers.\n“You really need to practice what to do if one of you trips or stumbles,\nmen,” Kaladin said. “When Moash stopped abruptly, you all about fell over.\nThat could be a disaster on the field.”\nThey stared at him, incredulous, and he couldn’t help but smile. In a\nmoment, they crowded around him, laughing and thumping him on the\nback. It wasn’t an entirely appropriate welcome for a sick man, particularly\nwhen Rock did it, but Kaladin did appreciate their enthusiasm.\nOnly Teft didn’t join in. The aging bridgeman stood at the side, arms\nfolded. He seemed concerned. “Teft?” Kaladin asked. “You all right?”\nTeft snorted, but showed a hint of a grin. “I just figure those lads don’t\nbathe often enough for me to want to get close enough for a hug. No\noffense.”\nKaladin laughed. “I understand.” His last “bath” had been the\nhighstorm.\nThe highstorm.\nThe other bridgemen continued to laugh, asking how he felt,\nproclaiming that Rock would have to fix something extra special for their\nnightly fireside meal. Kaladin smiled and nodded, assuring them he felt\nwell, but he was remembering the storm.\nHe recalled it distinctly. Holding to the ring atop the building, his head\ndown and eyes closed against the pelting torrent. He remembered Syl,\nstanding protectively before him, as if she could turn back the storm itself.\nHe couldn’t see her about now. Where was she?\nHe also remembered the face. The Stormfather himself? Surely not. A\ndelusion. Yes…yes, he’d certainly been delusional. Memories of deathspren\nwere blended with relived parts of his life—and both mixed with strange,\nsudden shocks of strength—icy cold, but refreshing. It had been like the\ncold air of a crisp morning after a long night in a stuffy room, or like\nrubbing the sap of gulket leaves on sore muscles, making them feel warm\nand cold at the same time.\nHe could remember those moments so clearly. What had caused them?\nThe fever?"

What had caused them?\nThe fever?\n“How long?” he said, checking over the bridgemen, counting them.\nThirty-three, counting Lopen and the silent Dabbid. Almost all were\naccounted for. Impossible. If his ribs were healed, then he must have been\nunconscious for three weeks, at least. How many bridge runs?\n“Ten days,” Moash said.\n“Impossible,” Kaladin said. “My wounds—”\n“Is why we’re so surprised to see you up and walking!” Rock said,\nlaughing. “You must have bones like granite. Is my name you should be\nhaving!”\nKaladin leaned back against the wall. Nobody corrected Moash. An\nentire crew of men couldn’t lose track of the weeks like that. “Idolir and\nTreff?” he asked.\n“We lost them,” Moash said, growing solemn. “We did two bridge runs\nwhile you were unconscious. Nobody badly wounded, but two dead. We…\nwe didn’t know how to help them.”\nThat made the men grow subdued. But death was the way of\nbridgemen, and they couldn’t afford to dwell for long on the lost.\nKaladin did decide, however, that he’d need to train a few of the others in\nhealing.\nBut how was he up and walking? Had he been less injured than he’d\nassumed? Hesitantly, he prodded at his side, feeling for broken ribs. Just a\nlittle sore. Other than the weakness, he felt as healthy as he ever had.\nPerhaps he should have paid a little more attention to his mother’s religious\nteachings.\nAs the men turned back to talking and celebrating, he noticed the looks\nthey gave him. Respectful, reverent. They remembered what he’d said\nbefore the highstorm. Looking back, Kaladin realized he’d been a little\ndelirious. It now seemed an incredibly arrogant proclamation, not to\nmention that it smelled of prophecy. If the ardents discovered that…\nWell, he couldn’t undo what he’d done. He’d just have to continue.\nYou were already balancing over a chasm, Kaladin thought to himself. Did\nyou have to scale an even higher cliffside?\nA sudden, mournful horn call sounded across the camp. The bridgemen\nfell silent. The horn sounded twice more.\n“Figures,” Natam said.\n“We’re on duty?” Kaladin asked.\n“Yeah,” Moash said.\n“Line up!” Rock snapped. “You know what to do! Let’s show Captain\nKaladin that we haven’t forgotten how to do this.”\n“‘Captain’ Kaladin?” Kaladin asked as the men lined up.\n“Sure, gancho,” Lopen said from beside him, speaking with that quick\naccent that seemed so at odds with his nonchalant attitude. “They tried to\nmake Rock bridgeleader, sure, but we just started calling you ‘captain’ and\nhim ‘squadleader.’ Made Gaz angry.” Lopen grinned.\nKaladin nodded.

Gritting his teeth, he let go of the barrack\nwall and crossed to where the bridgemen stood in line, leaders of the sub-\nsquads doing a quick check of their vests and sandals.\nRock eyed Kaladin. “And what is this thing you believe you are\ndoing?”\n“I’m joining you,” Kaladin said.\n“And what would you tell one of the men if they had just gotten up\nfrom a week with the fevers?”\nKaladin hesitated. I’m not like the other men, he thought, then\nregretted it. He couldn’t start believing himself invincible. To run now with\nthe crew, as weak as he was, would be sheer idiocy. “You’re right.”\n“You can help me and the moolie carry water, gancho,” Lopen said.\n“We’re a team now. Go on every run.”\nKaladin nodded. “All right.”\nRock eyed him.\n“If I’m feeling too weak at the end of the permanent bridges, I’ll go\nback. I promise.”\nRock nodded reluctantly. The men marched under the bridge to the\nstaging area, and Kaladin joined Lopen and Dabbid, filling waterskins.\nKaladin stood at the edge of the precipice, hands clasped behind his back,\nsandaled toes at the very edge of the cliff. The chasm stared up at him, but\nhe did not meet its gaze. He was focused on the battle being waged on the\nnext plateau.\nThis approach had been an easy one; they’d arrived at the same time as\nthe Parshendi. Instead of bothering to kill bridgemen, the Parshendi had\ntaken a defensive position in the center of the plateau, around the chrysalis.\nNow Sadeas’s men fought them.\nKaladin’s brow was slick with sweat from the day’s heat, and he still\nfelt a lingering exhaustion from his sickness. Yet it wasn’t nearly as bad as\nit should have been. The surgeon’s son was baffled.\nFor the moment, the soldier overruled the surgeon. He was transfixed\nby the battle. Alethi spearmen in leathers and breastplates pressed a curved\nline against the Parshendi warriors. Most Parshendi used battle-axes or\nhammers, though a few wielded swords or clubs. They all had that red-\norange armor growing from their skin, and they fought in pairs, singing all\nthe while.\nIt was the worst kind of battle, the kind that was close.

When that happened, your commander would order the retreat\nto cut his losses. But close battles…they were brutal, blood-soaked things.\nWatching the fighting—the bodies dropped to the rocks, the weapons\nflashing, the men pushed off the plateau—reminded him of his first fights as\na spearman. His commander had been shocked at how easily Kaladin dealt\nwith seeing blood. Kaladin’s father would have been shocked at how easily\nKaladin spilled it.\nThere was a big difference between his battles in Alethkar and the\nfights on the Shattered Plains. There, he’d been surrounded by the worst—\nor at least worst-trained—soldiers in Alethkar. Men who didn’t hold their\nlines. And yet, for all their disorder, those fights had made sense to him.\nThese here on the Shattered Plains still did not.\nThat had been his miscalculation. He’d changed battlefield tactics\nbefore understanding them. He would not make that mistake again.\nRock stepped up beside Kaladin, joined by Sigzil. The thick-limbed\nHorneater made for quite a contrast to the short, quiet Azish man. Sigzil’s\nskin was a deep brown—not true black, like some parshmen’s. He tended to\nkeep to himself.\n“Is bad battle,” Rock said, folding his arms. “The soldiers will not be\nhappy, whether or not they win.”\nKaladin nodded absently, listening to the yells, screams, and curses.\n“Why do they fight, Rock?”\n“For money,” Rock said. “And for vengeance. You should know this\nthing. Is it not your king who Parshendi killed?”\n“Oh, I understand why we fight,” Kaladin said. “But the Parshendi.\nWhy do they fight?”\nRock grinned. “Is because they don’t very much like the idea of being\nbeheaded for killing your king, I should think! Very unaccommodating of\nthem.”\nKaladin smiled, though he found mirth unnatural while watching men\ndie. He had been trained too long by his father for any death to leave him\nunmoved. “Perhaps. But, then, why do they fight for the gemhearts? Their\nnumbers are dwindling because of skirmishes like these.”\n“You know this thing?” Rock asked.\n“They raid less frequently than they used to,” Kaladin said. “People\ntalk about it in camp. And they don’t strike as close to the Alethi side as\nthey once did.”\nRock nodded thoughtfully. “It seems logical. Ha! Perhaps we will soon\nwin this fight and be going home.”\n“No,” Sigzil said softly. He had a very formal way of speaking, with\nbarely a hint of an accent. What language did the Azish speak, anyway?\nTheir kingdom was so distant that Kaladin had only ever met one other. “I\ndoubt that. And I can tell you why they fight, Kaladin.”\n“Really?”\n“They must have Soulcasters. They need the gemstones for the same\nreason we do. To make food.”\n“It sounds reasonable,” Kaladin said, hands still clasped behind his\nback, feet in a wide stance. Parade rest still felt natural to him. “Just"

        "text": "reason we do. To make food.”\n“It sounds reasonable,” Kaladin said, hands still clasped behind his\nback, feet in a wide stance. Parade rest still felt natural to him. “Just\nconjecture, but a reasonable one. Let me ask you something else, then. Why\ncan’t bridgemen have shields?”\n“Because this thing makes us too slow,” Rock said.\n“No,” Sigzil said. “They could send bridgemen with shields out in\nfront of the bridges, running in front of us. It wouldn’t slow anyone down.\nYes, you would have to field more bridgemen—but you’d save enough lives\nwith those shields to make up for the larger roster.”\nKaladin nodded. “Sadeas fields more of us than he needs already. In\nmost cases, more bridges land than he needs.”\n“But why?” Sigzil asked.\n“Because we make good targets,” Kaladin said softly, understanding.\n“We’re put out in front to draw Parshendi attention.”\n“Of course we are,” Rock said, shrugging. “Armies always do these\nthings. The poorest and the least trained go first.”\n“I know,” Kaladin said, “but usually, they’re at least given some\nmeasure of protection. Don’t you see? We’re not just an expendable initial\nwave. We’re bait. We’re exposed, so the Parshendi can’t help but fire at us.\nIt allows the regular soldiers to approach without being hurt. The Parshendi\narchers are aiming at the bridgemen.”\nRock frowned.\n“Shields would make us less tempting,” Kaladin said. “That’s why he\nforbids them.”\n“Perhaps,” Sigzil said from the side, thoughtful. “But it seems foolish\nto waste troops.”\n“Actually, it isn’t foolish,” Kaladin said. “If you have to repeatedly\nattack fortified positions, you can’t afford to lose your trained troops. Don’t\nyou see? Sadeas has only a limited number of trained men. But untrained\nones are easy to find. Each arrow that strikes down a bridgeman is one that\ndoesn’t hit a soldier you’ve spent a great deal of money outfitting and\ntraining. That’s why it’s better for Sadeas to field a large number of\nbridgemen, rather than a smaller—but protected—number.”\nHe should have seen it earlier. He had been distracted by how\nimportant bridgemen were to the battles. If the bridges didn’t arrive at the\nchasms, then the army couldn’t cross. But each bridge crew was kept well\nstocked with bodies, and twice as many bridge crews were sent on an\nassault as were needed.\nSeeing a bridge fall must give the Parshendi a great sense of\nsatisfaction, and they usually got to drop two or three bridges on every bad\nchasm run. Sometimes more. So long as bridgemen were dying, and the\nParshendi didn’t spend their time firing on soldiers, Sadeas had reason to\nkeep the bridgemen vulnerable. The Parshendi should have seen through it,\nbut it was very hard to turn your arrow away from the unarmored man\ncarrying the siege equipment. The Parshendi were said to be\nunsophisticated fighters. Indeed, watching the battle on the other plateau—\nstudying it, focusing—he saw that was true."

        "text": "carrying the siege equipment. The Parshendi were said to be\nunsophisticated fighters. Indeed, watching the battle on the other plateau—\nstudying it, focusing—he saw that was true.\nWhere the Alethi maintained a straight, disciplined line—each man\nprotecting his partners—the Parshendi attacked in independent pairs. The\nAlethi had superior technique and tactics. True, each of the Parshendi was\nsuperior in strength, and their skill with those axes was remarkable. But\nSadeas’s Alethi troops were well trained in modern formations. Once they\ngot a foothold—and if they could prolong the battle—their discipline often\nsaw them to victory.\nThe Parshendi haven’t fought in large-scale battles before this war,\nKaladin decided. They’re used to smaller skirmishes, perhaps against other\nvillages or clans.\nSeveral of the other bridgemen joined Kaladin, Rock, and Sigzil.\nBefore long, the majority of them were standing there, some imitating\nKaladin’s stance. It took another hour before the battle was won. Sadeas\nproved victorious, but Rock was right. The soldiers were grim; they’d lost\nmany friends this day.\nIt was a tired, battered group of spearmen that Kaladin and the others\nled back to camp.\nA few hours later, Kaladin sat on a chunk of wood beside Bridge Four’s\nnightly fire. Syl sat on his knee, having taken the form of a small,\ntranslucent blue and white flame. She’d come to him during the march\nback, spinning around gleefully to see him up and walking, but had given\nno explanation for her absence.\nThe real fire crackled and popped, Rock’s large pot bubbling on top of\nit, some flamespren dancing on the logs. Every couple of seconds, someone\nasked Rock if the stew was done yet, often banging on his bowl with a\ngood-natured smack of the spoon. Rock said nothing, stirring. They all\nknew that nobody ate until he declared the stew finished; he was very\nparticular about not serving “inferior” food.\nThe air smelled of boiling dumplings. The men were laughing. Their\nbridgeleader had survived execution and today’s bridge run hadn’t cost a\nsingle casualty. Spirits were high.\nExcept for Kaladin’s.\nHe understood now. He understood just how futile their struggle was.\nHe understood why Sadeas hadn’t bothered to acknowledge Kaladin’s\nsurvival. He was already a bridgeman, and being a bridgeman was a death\nsentence.\nKaladin had hoped to show Sadeas that his bridge crew could be\nefficient and useful. He’d hoped to prove that they deserved protection—\nshields, armor, training. Kaladin thought that if they acted like soldiers,\nmaybe they would be seen as soldiers.\nNone of that would work. A bridgeman who survived was, by\ndefinition, a bridgeman who had failed.\nHis men laughed and enjoyed the fire. They trusted him. He’d done\nthe impossible, surviving a highstorm, wounded, tied to a wall. Surely he\nwould perform another miracle, this time for them. They were good men,\nbut they thought like foot soldiers. The officers and the lighteyes would\nworry about the long term. The men were fed and happy, and that was\nenough for now.\nNot for Kaladin."

The men were fed and happy, and that was\nenough for now.\nNot for Kaladin.\nHe found himself face-to-face with the man he’d left behind. The one\nhe’d abandoned that night he’d decided not to throw himself into the chasm.\nA man with haunted eyes, a man who had given up on caring or hoping. A\nwalking corpse.\nI’m going to fail them, he thought.\nHe couldn’t let them continue running bridges, dying off one by one.\nBut he also couldn’t think of an alternative. And so their laughter tore at\nhim.\nOne of the men—Maps—stood, holding up his arms, quieting the\nothers. It was the time between moons, and so he was lit mostly by the\nfirelight; there was a spray of stars in the sky above. Several of those moved\nabout, the tiny pinpricks of light chasing after one another, zipping around\nlike distant, glowing insects. Starspren. They were rare.\nMaps was a flat-faced fellow, his beard bushy, his eyebrows thick.\nEveryone called him Maps because of the birthmark on his chest that he\nswore was an exact map of Alethkar, though Kaladin hadn’t been able to\nsee the resemblance.\nMaps cleared his throat. “It’s a good night, a special night, and all.\nWe’ve got our bridgeleader back.”\nSeveral of the men clapped. Kaladin tried not to show how sick he felt\ninside.\n“We’ve got good food coming,” Maps said. He eyed Rock. “It is\ncoming, ain’t it, Rock?”\n“Is coming,” Rock said, stirring.\n“You’re sure about that? We could go on another bridge run. Give you\na little extra time, you know, five or six more hours….”\nRock gave him a fierce look. The men laughed, several banging their\nbowls with their spoons. Maps chuckled, then he reached to the ground\nbehind the stone he was using for a seat. He pulled out a paper-wrapped\npackage and tossed it to Rock.\nSurprised, the tall Horneater barely caught it, nearly dropping it into\nthe stew.\n“From all of us,” Maps said, a little awkwardly, “for making us stew\neach night. Don’t think we haven’t noticed how hard you work on it. We\nrelax while you cook. And you always serve everyone else first. So we\nbought you something to thank you.” He wiped his nose on his arm,\nspoiling the moment slightly, and sat back down. Several of the other\nbridgemen thumped him on the back, complimenting his speech.\nRock unwrapped the package and stared into it for a long while.\nKaladin leaned forward, trying to get a look at the contents. Rock reached\nin and held the item up. It was a straight razor of gleaming silvery steel;\nthere was a length of wood covering the sharp side. Rock pulled this off,\ninspecting the blade. “You airsick fools,” he said softly. “Is beautiful.”\n“There’s a piece of polished steel too,” said Peet. “For a mirror. And\nsome beard soap and a leather strop for sharpening.”\nAmazingly, Rock grew teary-eyed. He turned away from the pot,"

He turned away from the pot,\nbearing his gifts. “Stew is ready,” he said. Then he ran into the barrack\nbuilding.\nThe men sat quietly. “Stormfather,” youthful Dunny finally said, “you\nthink we did the right thing? I mean, the way he complains and all…”\n“I think it was perfect,” Teft said. “Just give the big lout some time to\nrecover.”\n“Sorry we didn’t get you nothin’, sir,” Maps said to Kaladin. “We\ndidn’t know you’d be awake and all.”\n“It’s all right,” Kaladin said.\n“Well,” Skar said. “Is someone going to serve that stew, or will we all\njust sit here hungry until it burns?”\nDunny jumped up, grabbing the ladle. The men gathered around the\npot, jostling one another as Dunny served. Without Rock there to snap at\nthem and keep them in line, it was something of a melee. Only Sigzil did\nnot join in. The quiet, dark-skinned man sat to the side, eyes reflecting the\nflames.\nKaladin rose. He was worried—terrified, really—that he might become\nthat wretch again. The one who had given up on caring because he saw no\nalternative. So he sought conversation, walking over toward Sigzil. His\nmotion disturbed Syl, who sniffed and buzzed up onto his shoulder. She still\nheld the form of a flickering flame; having that on his shoulder was even\nmore distracting. He didn’t say anything; if she knew it bothered him, she’d\nbe likely to do it more. She was still a windspren, after all.\nKaladin sat down next to Sigzil. “Not hungry?”\n“They are more eager than I,” Sigzil said. “If previous evenings are a\nreliable guide, there will still be enough for me once they have filled their\nbowls.”\nKaladin nodded. “I appreciated your analysis out on the plateau\ntoday.”\n“I am good at that, sometimes.”\n“You’re educated. You speak like it and you act like it.”\nSigzil hesitated. “Yes,” he finally said. “Among my people, it is not a\nsin for a male to be keen of mind.”\n“It isn’t a sin for Alethi either.”\n“My experience is that you care only about wars and the art of killing.”\n“And what have you seen of us besides our army?”\n“Not much,” Sigzil admitted.\n“So, a man of education,” Kaladin said thoughtfully. “In a bridge\ncrew.”\n“My education was never completed.”\n“Neither was mine.”\nSigzil looked at him, curious.\n“I apprenticed as a surgeon,” Kaladin said.\nSigzil nodded, thick dark hair falling around his shoulders. He’d been\none of the only bridgemen who bothered shaving. Now that Rock had a\nrazor, maybe that would change. “A surgeon,” he said. “I cannot say that is\nsurprising, considering how you handled the wounded. The men say that\nyou’re secretly a lighteyes of very high rank.”\n“What? But my eyes are dark brown!”"

But my eyes are dark brown!”\n“Pardon me,” Sigzil said. “I didn’t speak the right word—you don’t\nhave the right word in your language. To you, a lighteyes is the same as a\nleader. In other kingdoms, though, other things make a man a…curse this\nAlethi language. A man of high birth. A brightlord, only without the eyes.\nAnyway, the men think you must have been raised outside of Alethkar. As a\nleader.”\nSigzil looked back at the others. They were beginning to sit back\ndown, attacking their stew with vigor. “It’s the way you lead so naturally,\nthe way you make others want to listen to you. These are things they\nassociate with lighteyes. And so they have invented a past for you. You will\nhave a difficult time disabusing them of it now.” Sigzil eyed him.\n“Assuming it is a fabrication. I was there in the chasm the day you used that\nspear.”\n“A spear,” Kaladin said. “A darkeyed soldier’s weapon, not a\nlighteyes’s sword.”\n“To many bridgemen, the difference is minimal. All are so far above\nus.”\n“So what is your story?”\nSigzil smirked. “I wondered if you were going to ask. The others\nmentioned that you have pried into their origins.”\n“I like to know the men I lead.”\n“And if some of us are murderers?” Sigzil asked quietly.\n“Then I’m in good company,” Kaladin said. “If it was a lighteyes you\nkilled, then I might buy you a drink.”\n“Not a lighteyes,” Sigzil said. “And he is not dead.”\n“Then you’re not a murderer,” Kaladin said.\n“Not for want of trying.” Sigzil’s eyes grew distant. “I thought for\ncertain I had succeeded. It was not the wisest choice I made. My master…”\nHe trailed off.\n“Is he the one you tried to kill?”\n“No.”\nKaladin waited, but no more information was forthcoming. A scholar,\nhe thought. Or at least a man of learning. There has to be a way to use this.\nFind a way out of this death trap, Kaladin. Use what you have. There\nhas to be a way.\n“You were right about the bridgemen,” Sigzil said. “We are sent to die.\nIt is the only reasonable explanation. There is a place in the world.\nMarabethia. Have you heard of it?”\n“No,” Kaladin said.\n“It is beside the sea, to the north, in the Selay lands. The people are\nknown for their great fondness for debate. At each intersection in the city\nthey have small pedestals on which a man can stand and proclaim his\narguments. It is said that everyone in Marabethia carries a pouch with an\noverripe fruit just in case they pass a proclaimer with whom they disagree.”\nKaladin frowned. He hadn’t heard so many words from Sigzil in all the\ntime they’d been bridgemen together.\n“What you said earlier, on the plateau,” Sigzil continued, eyes forward,"

You see, they have a curious way of\ntreating condemned criminals. They dangle them over the seaside cliff near\nthe city, down near the water at high tide, with a cut sliced in each cheek.\nThere is a particular species of greatshell in the depths there. The creatures\nare known for their succulent flavor, and of course they have gemhearts.\nNot nearly as large as the ones in these chasmfiends, but still nice. So the\ncriminals, they become bait. A criminal may demand execution instead, but\nthey say if you hang there for a week and are not eaten, then you can go\nfree.”\n“And does that often happen?” Kaladin asked.\nSigzil shook his head. “Never. But the prisoners almost always take the\nchance. The Marabethians have a saying for someone who refuses to see the\ntruth of a situation. ‘You have eyes of red and blue,’ they say. Red for the\nblood dripping. Blue for the water. It is said that these two things are all the\nprisoners see. Usually they are attacked within one day. And yet, most still\nwish to take that chance. They prefer the false hope.”\nEyes of red and blue, Kaladin thought, imagining the morbid picture.\n“You do a good work,” Sigzil said, rising, picking up his bowl. “At\nfirst, I hated you for lying to the men. But I have come to see that a false\nhope makes them happy. What you do is like giving medicine to a sick man\nto ease his pain until he dies. Now these men can spend their last days in\nlaughter. You are a healer indeed, Kaladin Stormblessed.”\nKaladin wanted to object, to say that it wasn’t a false hope, but he\ncouldn’t. Not with his heart in his stomach. Not with what he knew.\nA moment later, Rock burst from the barrack. “I feel like a true\nalil’tiki’i again!” he proclaimed, holding aloft his razor. “My friends, you\ncannot know what you have done! Someday, I will take you to the Peaks\nand show you the hospitality of kings!”\nDespite all of his complaining, he hadn’t shaved his beard off\ncompletely. He had left long, red-blond sideburns, which curved down to\nhis chin. The tip of the chin itself was shaved clean, as were his lips. On the\ntall, oval-faced man, the look was quite distinctive. “Ha!” Rock said,\nstriding up to the fire. He grabbed the nearest men there and hugged them\nboth to him, causing Bisig to nearly spill his stew. “I will make you all\nfamily for this. A peak dweller’s humaka’aban is his pride! I feel like a true\nman again. Here. This razor belongs not to me, but to us all. Any who\nwishes to use it must do so.

I don’t know if that fits us. For\nhim to have eyes of red and blue, Kaladin would have to believe that there\nwas at least a small chance the bridge crew could survive. This night,\nKaladin had trouble convincing himself.\nHe’d never been an optimist. He saw the world as it was, or he tried to.\nThat was a problem, though, when the truth he saw was so terrible.\nOh, Stormfather, he thought, feeling the crushing weight of despair as\nhe stared down at his bowl. I’m falling back to the wretch I was. I’m losing\nmy grip on this, on myself.\nHe couldn’t carry the hopes of all the bridgemen.\nHe just wasn’t strong enough.\nFIVE AND A HALF YEARS AGO\nKaladin pushed past the shrieking Laral and stumbled into the surgery\nroom. Even after years working with his father, the amount of blood in the\nroom was shocking. It was as if someone had dumped out a bucket of bright\nred paint.\nThe scent of burned flesh hung in the air. Lirin worked frantically on\nBrightlord Rillir, Roshone’s son. An evil-looking, tusklike thing jutted from\nthe young man’s abdomen, and his lower right leg was crushed. It hung by\nonly a few tendons, splinters of bone poking out like reeds from the waters\nof a pond. Brightlord Roshone himself lay on the side table, groaning, eyes\nsqueezed shut as he held his leg, which was pierced by another of the bony\nspears. Blood leaked from his improvised bandage, flowed down the side of\nthe table, and dripped to the floor to mix with his son’s.\nKaladin stood in the doorway gaping. Laral continued to scream. She\nclutched the doorframe as several of Roshone’s guards tried to pull her\naway. Her wails were frantic. “Do something! Work harder! He can’t! He\nwas where it happened and I don’t care and let me go!” The garbled phrases\ndegenerated into screeches. The guards finally got her away.\n“Kaladin!” his father snapped. “I need you!”\nShocked into motion, Kaladin entered the room, scrubbing his hands\nthen gathering bandages from the cabinet, stepping in blood. He caught\na glimpse of Rillir’s face; much of the skin on the right side had been\nscraped off. The eyelid was gone, the blue eye itself sliced open at the front,\ndeflated like the skin of a grape pressed for wine.\nKaladin hastened to his father with the bandages. His mother appeared\nat the doorway a moment later, Tien behind her. She raised a hand to her\nmouth, then pulled Tien away. He stumbled, looking woozy. She returned in\na moment without him.\n“Water, Kaladin!” Lirin cried. “Hesina, fetch more. Quickly!”"

Quickly!”\nHis mother jumped to help, though she rarely assisted in the surgery\nanymore. Her hands shook as she grabbed one of the buckets and ran\noutside. Kaladin took the other bucket, which was full, to his father as Lirin\neased the length of bone from the young lighteyes’s gut. Rillir’s remaining\neye fluttered, head quivering.\n“What is that?” Kaladin asked, pressing the bandage to the wound as\nhis father tossed the strange object aside.\n“Whitespine tusk,” his father said. “Water.”\nKaladin grabbed a sponge, dunked it in the bucket, and used it to\nsqueeze water into Rillir’s gut wound. That washed away the blood, giving\nLirin a good look at the damage. He quested with his fingers as Kaladin got\nsome needle and thread ready. There was already a tourniquet on the leg.\nFull amputation would come later.\nLirin hesitated, fingers inside the gaping hole in Rillir’s belly. Kaladin\ncleaned the wound again. He looked up at his father, concerned.\nLirin pulled his fingers out and walked to Brightlord Roshone.\n“Bandages, Kaladin,” he said curtly.\nKaladin hurried over, though he shot a look over his shoulder at Rillir.\nThe once-handsome young lighteyes trembled again, spasming. “Father…”\n“Bandages!” Lirin said.\n“What are you doing, surgeon?” Roshone bellowed. “What of my\nson?” Painspren swarmed around him.\n“Your son is dead,” Lirin said, yanking the tusk free from Roshone’s\nleg.\nThe lighteyes bellowed in agony, though Kaladin couldn’t tell if that\nwas because of the tusk or his son. Roshone clenched his jaw as Kaladin\npressed the bandage down on his leg. Lirin dunked his hands in the water\nbucket, then quickly wiped them with knobweed sap to frighten off\nrotspren.\n“My son is not dead,” Roshone growled. “I can see him moving! Tend\nto him, surgeon.”\n“Kaladin, get the dazewater,” Lirin ordered gathering his sewing\nneedle.\nKaladin hurried to the back of the room, steps splashing blood, and\nthrew open the far cupboard. He took out a small flask of clear liquid.\n“What are you doing?” Roshone bellowed, trying to sit up. “Look at\nmy son! Almighty above, look at him!”\nKaladin turned hesitantly, pausing as he poured dazewater on a\nbandage. Rillir was spasming more violently.\n“I work under three guidelines, Roshone,” Lirin said, forcibly pressing\nthe lighteyes down against his table. “The guidelines every surgeon uses\nwhen choosing between two patients. If the wounds are equal, treat the\nyoungest first.”\n“Then see to my son!”\n“If the wounds are not equally threatening,” Lirin continued, “treat the\nworst wound first.”\n“As I’ve been telling you!”"

I’m sorry, Roshone. I would save him if I could, I promise you. But\nI cannot.”\n“No!” Roshone said, struggling again.\n“Kaladin! Quickly!” Lirin said.\nKaladin dashed over. He pressed the bandage of dazewater to\nRoshone’s chin and mouth, just below the nose, forcing the lighteyed man\nto breathe the fumes. Kaladin held his own breath, as he’d been trained.\nRoshone bellowed and screamed, but the two of them held him down,\nand he was weak from blood loss. Soon, his bellows became softer. In\nseconds, he was speaking in gibberish and grinning to himself. Lirin turned\nback to the leg wound while Kaladin went to throw away the dazewater\nbandage.\n“No. Administer it to Rillir.” His father didn’t look away from his\nwork. “It’s the only mercy we can give him.”\nKaladin nodded and used the dazewater bandage on the wounded\nyouth. Rillir’s breathing grew less frantic, though he didn’t seem conscious\nenough to notice the effects. Then Kaladin threw the bandage with the\ndazewater into the brazier; heat negated the effects. The white, puffy\nbandage wrinkled and browned in the fire, steam streaming off it as the\nedges burst into flame.\nKaladin returned with the sponge and washed out Roshone’s wound as\nLirin prodded at it. There were a few shards of tusk trapped inside, and\nLirin muttered to himself, getting out his tongs and razor-sharp knife.\n“Damnation can take them all,” Lirin said, pulling out the first sliver of\ntusk. Behind him, Rillir fell still. “Isn’t sending half of us to war enough for\nthem? Do they have to seek death even when they’re living in a quiet\ntownship? Roshone should never have gone looking for the storming\nwhitespine.”\n“He was looking for it?”\n“They went hunting it,” Lirin spat. “Wistiow and I used to joke about\nlighteyes like them. If you can’t kill men, you kill beasts. Well, this is what\nyou found, Roshone.”\n“Father,” Kaladin said softly. “He’s not going to be pleased with you\nwhen he awakes.” The brightlord was humming softly, lying back, eyes\nclosed.\nLirin didn’t respond. He yanked out another fragment of tusk, and\nKaladin washed out the wound. His father pressed his fingers to the side of\nthe large puncture, inspecting it.\nThere was one more sliver of tusk, jutting from a muscle inside the\nwound.

He tossed it aside, then calmly reached for his\nthread and needle.\nBehind them, Rillir had stopped breathing.\nThat evening, Kaladin sat on the steps to his house, hands in his lap.\nRoshone had been returned to his estate to be cared for by his personal\nservants. His son’s corpse was cooling in the crypt below, and a messenger\nhad been sent to request a Soulcaster for the body.\nOn the horizon, the sun was red as blood. Everywhere Kaladin looked,\nthe world was red.\nThe door to the surgery closed, and his father—looking as exhausted\nas Kaladin felt—tottered out. He eased himself down, sighing as he sat\nbeside Kaladin, looking at the sun. Did it look like blood to him too?\nThey didn’t speak as the sun slowly sank before them. Why was it\nmost colorful when it was about to vanish for the night? Was it angry at\nbeing forced belong the horizon? Or was it a showman, giving a\nperformance before retiring?\nWhy was the most colorful part of people’s bodies—the brightness of\ntheir blood—hidden beneath the skin, never to be seen unless something\nwent wrong?\nNo, Kaladin thought. The blood isn’t the most colorful part of a body.\nThe eyes can be colorful too. The blood and the eyes. Both representations\nof one’s heritage. And one’s nobility.\n“I saw inside a man today,” Kaladin finally said.\n“Not for the first time,” Lirin said, “and certainly not for the last. I’m\nproud of you. I expected to find you here crying, as you usually do when we\nlose a patient. You’re learning.”\n“When I said I saw inside a man,” Kaladin said, “I wasn’t talking\nabout the wounds.”\nLirin didn’t respond for a moment. “I see.”\n“You would have let him die if I hadn’t been there, wouldn’t you?”\nSilence.\n“Why didn’t you?” Kaladin said. “It would have solved so much!”\n“It wouldn’t have been letting him die. It would have been murdering\nhim.”\n“You could have just let him bleed, then claimed you couldn’t save\nhim. Nobody would have questioned you. You could have done it.”\n“No,” Lirin said, staring at the sunset. “No, I couldn’t have.”\n“But why?”\n“Because I’m not a killer, son.”\nKaladin frowned.\nLirin had a distant look in his eyes. “Somebody has to start. Somebody\nhas to step forward and do what is right, because it is right. If nobody starts,\nthen others cannot follow. The lighteyes do their best to kill themselves, and"

The others still haven’t brought back Alds and Milp. Roshone just\nleft them there.”\nAlds and Milp, two townsmen, had been on the hunt but hadn’t\nreturned with the party bearing the two wounded lighteyes. Roshone had\nbeen so worried about Rillir that he’d left them behind so he could travel\nquickly.\n“The lighteyes don’t care about life,” Lirin said. “So I must. That’s\nanother reason why I wouldn’t have let Roshone die, even if you hadn’t\nbeen there. Though looking at you did strengthen me.”\n“I wish it hadn’t,” Kaladin said.\n“You mustn’t say such things.”\n“Why not?”\n“Because, son. We have to be better than they are.” He sighed,\nstanding. “You should sleep. I may need you when the others return with\nAlds and Milp.”\nThat wasn’t likely; the two townsmen were probably dead by now.\nTheir wounds were said to be pretty bad. Plus, the whitespines were still out\nthere.\nLirin went inside, but didn’t compel Kaladin to follow.\nWould I have let him die? Kaladin wondered. Maybe even flicked that\nknife to hasten him on his way? Roshone had been nothing but a blight\nsince his arrival, but did that justify killing him?\nNo. Cutting that artery wouldn’t have been justified. But what\nobligation had Kaladin to help? Withholding his aid wasn’t the same thing\nas killing. It just wasn’t.\nKaladin thought it through a dozen different ways, pondering his\nfather’s words. What he found shocked him. He honestly would have let\nRoshone die on that table. It would have been better for Kaladin’s family; it\nwould have been better for the entire town.\nKaladin’s father had once laughed at his son’s desire to go to war.\nIndeed, now that Kaladin had decided he would become a surgeon on his\nown terms, his thoughts and actions of earlier years felt childish to him. But\nLirin thought Kaladin incapable of killing. You can hardly step on a\ncremling without feeling guilty, son, he’d said. Ramming your spear into a\nman would be nowhere near as easy as you seem to think.\nBut his father was wrong. It was a stunning, frightening revelation.\nThis wasn’t idle fancy or daydreaming about the glory of battle. This was\nreal.\nAt that moment, Kaladin knew he could kill, if he needed to. Some\npeople—like a festering finger or a leg shattered beyond repair—just\nneeded to be removed.\n“Like a highstorm, regular in their coming, yet always unexpected.”\n—The word Desolation is used twice in reference to their appearances.\nSee pages 57, 59, and 64 of Tales by Hearthlight.\n“I’ve made my decision,” Shallan declared.\nJasnah looked up from her research.

You can be moral without following the law,\nand you can be immoral while following the law.”\n“But you also said what I did was ‘right’ but not ‘moral.’ The\ndistinction between those two seems less easy to define.”\n“An action can be right,” Shallan said. “It is simply something done,\nviewed without considering intent. Killing four men in self-defense is\nright.”\n“But not moral?”\n“Morality applies to your intent and the greater context of the\nsituation. Seeking out men to kill is an immoral act, Jasnah, regardless of\nthe eventual outcome.”\nJasnah tapped her desktop with a fingernail. She was wearing her\nglove, the gemstones of the broken Soulcaster bulging beneath. It had been\ntwo weeks. Surely she’d discovered that it didn’t work. How could she be\nso calm?\nWas she trying to fix it in secret? Perhaps she feared that if she\nrevealed it was broken, she would lose political power. Or had she realized\nthat hers had been swapped for a different Soulcaster? Could it be, despite\nall odds, that Jasnah just hadn’t tried to use the Soulcaster? Shallan needed\nto leave before too long. But if she left before Jasnah discovered the swap,\nshe risked having the woman try her Soulcaster just after Shallan vanished,\nbringing suspicion directly on her. The anxious waiting was driving Shallan\nnear to madness.\nFinally, Jasnah nodded, then returned to her research.\n“You have nothing to say?” Shallan said. “I just accused you of\nmurder.”\n“No,” Jasnah said, “murder is a legal definition. You said I killed\nunethically.”\n“You think I’m wrong, I assume?”\n“You are,” Jasnah said. “But I accept that you believe what you are\nsaying and have put rational thought behind it. I have looked over your\nnotes, and I believe you understand the various philosophies. In some cases,\nI think that you were quite insightful in your interpretation of them. The\nlesson was instructive.” She opened her book.\n“Then that’s it?”\n“Of course not,” Jasnah said. “We will study philosophy further in the\nfuture; for now, I’m satisfied that you have established a solid foundation in\nthe topic.”\n“But I still decided you were wrong. I still think there’s an absolute\nTruth out there.”\n“Yes,” Jasnah said, “and it took you two weeks of struggling to come\nto that conclusion.” Jasnah looked up, meeting Shallan’s eyes. “It wasn’t\neasy, was it?”\n“No.”\n“And you still wonder, don’t you?”\n“Yes.\n“That is enough.” Jasnah narrowed her eyes slightly, a consoling smile\nappearing on her lips. “If it helps you wrestle with your feelings, child,\nunderstand that I was trying to do good.

I sometimes wonder if I should\naccomplish more with my Soulcaster.” She turned back to her reading. “You\nare free for the rest of the day.”\nShallan blinked. “What?”\n“Free,” Jasnah said. “You may go. Do as you please. You’ll spend it\ndrawing beggars and barmaids, I suspect, but you may choose. Be off with\nyou.”\n“Yes, Brightness! Thank you.”\nJasnah waved in dismissal and Shallan grabbed her portfolio and\nhastened from the alcove. She hadn’t had any free time since the day she’d\ngone sketching on her own in the gardens. She’d been gently chided for\nthat; Jasnah had left her in her rooms to rest, not go out sketching.\nShallan waited impatiently as the parshman porters lowered her lift to\nthe Veil’s groundfloor, then hurried out into the cavernous central hall. A\nlong walk later, she approached the guest quarters, nodding to the master-\nservants who served there. Half guards, half concierges, they monitored\nwho entered and left.\nShe used her thick brass key to unlock the door to Jasnah’s rooms, then\nslipped inside and locked the door behind her. The small sitting chamber—\nfurnished with a rug and two chairs beside the hearth—was lit by topazes.\nThe table still contained a half-full cup of orange wine from Jasnah’s late\nresearch the night before, along with a few crumbs of bread on a plate.\nShallan hurried to her own chamber, then shut the door and took the\nSoulcaster out of her safepouch. The warm glow of the gemstones bathed\nher face in white and red light. They were large enough—and therefore\nbright enough—that it was hard to look at them directly. Each would be\nworth ten or twenty broams.\nShe’d been forced to hide them outside in the recent highstorm to\ninfuse them, and that had been its own source of anxiety. She took a deep\nbreath, then knelt and slid a small wooden stick from under the bed. A week\nand a half of practice, and she still hadn’t managed to make the Soulcaster\ndo…well, anything at all. She’d tried tapping the gems, twisting them,\nshaking her hand, and flexing her hand in exact mimicry of Jasnah. She’d\nstudied picture after picture she’d drawn of the process. She tried speaking,\nconcentrating, and even begging.\nHowever, she’d found a book the day before that had offered what\nseemed like a useful tip. It claimed that humming, of all things, could make\na Soulcasting more effective. It was just a passing reference, but it was\nmore than she’d found anywhere else. She sat down on her bed and forced\nherself to concentrate. She closed her eyes, holding the stick, imagining it\ntransforming into quartz. Then she began humming.\nNothing happened. She kept on humming though, trying different\nnotes, concentrating as hard as she could. She kept her attention on the task\nfor a good half hour, but eventually her mind began to wander. A new worry\nbegan to nibble at her. Jasnah was one of the most brilliant, insightful"

She’d put the Soulcaster out where it could be taken.\nHad she intentionally duped Shallan with a fake?\nIt seemed an awful lot of trouble to go through. Why not just spring\nthe trap and reveal Shallan as a thief? The fact that she couldn’t get the\nSoulcaster to work left her straining plausibility for explanations.\nShe stopped humming and opened her eyes. The stick had not\nchanged. So much for that tip, she thought, setting the stick aside with a\nsigh. She’d been so hopeful.\nShe lay back on the bed, resting, staring up at the brown stone ceiling,\ncut—like the rest of the Conclave—directly out of the mountain. Here, the\nstone had been left intentionally rough, evoking the roof of a cave. It was\nquite beautiful in a subtle way she’d never noticed before, the colors and\ncontours of the rock rippling like a disturbed pond.\nShe took a sheet from her portfolio and began to sketch the rock\npatterns. One sketch to calm her, and then she would get back to the\nSoulcaster. Perhaps she should try it on her other hand again.\nShe couldn’t capture the colors of the strata, not in charcoal, but she\ncould record the fascinating way the strata wove together. Like a work of\nart. Had some stoneworker cut this ceiling intentionally, crafting this subtle\ncreation, or was it an accident of nature? She smiled, imagining some\noverworked stonecutter noticing the beautiful grain of the rock and deciding\nto form a wave pattern for his own personal wonder and sense of beauty.\n“What are you?”\nShallan yelped, sitting up, sketchpad bouncing free of her lap.\nSomeone had whispered those words. She’d heard them distinctly!\n“Who is there?” she asked.\nSilence.\n“Who’s there!” she said more loudly, her heart beating quickly.\nSomething sounded outside her door, from the sitting room. Shallan\njumped, hiding the hand wearing the Soulcaster under a pillow as the door\ncreaked open, revealing a wizened palace maid, darkeyed and dressed in a\nwhite and black uniform.\n“Oh dear!” the woman exclaimed. “I had no idea you were here,\nBrightness.” She bowed low.\nA palace maid. Here to clean the room, an everyday occurrence.\nFocused on her meditation, Shallan hadn’t heard her enter. “Why did you\nspeak to me?”\n“Speak to you, Brightness?”\n“You…” No, the voice had been a whisper, and it had quite distinctly\ncome from inside Shallan’s room. It couldn’t have been the maid.\nShe shivered and glanced about. But that was foolish. The tiny room\nwas easily inspected. There were no Voidbringers hiding in the corners or\nunder her bed.\nWhat, then, had she heard? Noises from the woman cleaning,\nobviously. Shallan’s mind had just interpreted those random sounds as\nwords.\nForcing herself to relax, Shallan looked out past the maid into the\nsitting room. The woman had cleaned up the wineglass and crumbs. A\nbroom leaned against the wall. In addition, Jasnah’s door was cracked open."

In addition, Jasnah’s door was cracked open.\n“Were you in Brightness Jasnah’s room?” Shallan demanded.\n“Yes, Brightness,” the woman said. “Tidying up the desk, making the\nbed—”\n“Brightness Jasnah does not like people entering her room. The maids\nhave been told not to clean in there.” The king had promised that his maids\nwere very carefully chosen, and there had never been issues of theft, but\nJasnah still insisted that none enter her bedchamber.\nThe woman paled. “I’m sorry, Brightness. I didn’t hear! I wasn’t told\n—”\n“Hush, it’s all right,” Shallan said. “You’ll want to go tell her what\nyou’ve done. She always notices if her things were moved. It will be better\nfor you if you go to her and explain.”\n“Y-Yes, Brightness.” The woman bowed again.\n“In fact,” Shallan said, something occurring to her. “You should go\nnow. No point putting it off.”\nThe elderly maid sighed. “Yes, of course, Brightness.” She withdrew.\nA few seconds later, the outside door closed and locked.\nShallan leapt up, pulling off the Soulcaster and stuffing it back in her\nsafepouch. She hurried outside, heart thumping, the strange voice forgotten\nas she seized the opportunity to look into Jasnah’s room. It was unlikely\nthat Shallan would discover anything useful about the Soulcaster, but she\ncouldn’t pass up the chance—not with the maid to blame for moving things.\nShe felt only a glimmer of guilt for this. She’d already stolen from\nJasnah. Compared with that, poking through her room was nothing.\nThe bedroom was larger than Shallan’s, though it still felt cramped\nbecause of the unavoidable lack of windows. Jasnah’s bed, a four-poster\nmonstrosity, took up half the space. The vanity was against the far wall, and\nbeside it the dressing table from which Shallan had originally stolen the\nSoulcaster. Other than a dresser, the only other thing in the room was the\ndesk, books piled high on the left side.\nShallan never got a chance to look at Jasnah’s notebooks. Might she,\nperhaps, have taken notes on the Soulcaster? Shallan sat at the desk,\nhurriedly pulling open the top drawer and poking through the brushpens,\ncharcoal pencils, and sheets of paper. All were organized neatly, and the\npaper was blank. The bottom right drawer held ink and empty notebooks.\nThe bottom left drawer had a small collection of reference books.\nThat left the books on the top of the table. Jasnah would have the\nmajority of her notebooks with her as she worked. But…yes, there were\nstill a few here. Heart fluttering, Shallan gathered up the three thin volumes\nand set them before her.\nNotes on Urithiru, the first one declared inside. The notebook was full\n—it appeared—of quotes from and notations about various books Jasnah\nhad found. All spoke of this place, Urithiru.

This notebook was also filled to capacity, but there was no\ntitle on it. Shallan picked through, reading some entries.\n“The ones of ash and fire, who killed like a swarm, relentless before\nthe Heralds…” Noted in Masly, page 337. Corroborated by Coldwin and\nHasavah.\n“They take away the light, wherever they lurk. Skin that is burned.”\nCormshen, page 104.\nInnia, in her recordings of children’s folktales, speaks of the\nVoidbringers as being “Like a highstorm, regular in their coming, yet\nalways unexpected.” The word Desolation is used twice in reference to their\nappearances. See pages 57, 59, and 64 of Tales by Hearthlight.\n“They changed, even as we fought them. Like shadows they were, that\ncan transform as the flame dances. Never underestimate them because of\nwhat you first see.” Purports to be a scrap collected from Talatin, a Radiant\nof the Order of Stonewards. The source—Guvlow’s Incarnate—is generally\nheld as reliable, though this is from a copied fragment of The Poem of the\nSeventh Morning, which has been lost.\nThey went on like that. Pages and pages. Jasnah had trained her in this\nmethod of note taking—once the notebook was filled, each item would be\nevaluated again for reliability and usefulness and copied to different, more\nspecific notebooks.\nFrowning, Shallan looked through the final notebook. It focused on\nNatanatan, the Unclaimed Hills, and the Shattered Plains. It collected\nrecords of discoveries by hunters, explorers, or tradesmen searching for a\nriver passage to New Natanan. Of the three notebooks, the largest was the\none that focused on the Voidbringers.\nThe Voidbringers again. Many people in more rural places whispered\nof them and other monsters of the dark. The raspings, or stormwhispers, or\neven the dreaded nightspren. Shallan had been taught by stern tutors that\nthese were superstition, fabrications of the Lost Radiants, who used tales of\nmonsters to justify their domination of mankind.\nThe ardents taught something else. They spoke of the Lost Radiants—\ncalled the Knights Radiant then—fighting off Voidbringers during the war\nto hold Roshar. According to these teachings, it was only after defeating the\nVoidbringers—and the departure of the Heralds—that the Radiants had\nfallen.\nBoth groups agreed that the Voidbringers were gone. Fabrications or\nlong-defeated enemies, the result was the same. Shallan could believe that\nsome people—some scholars, even—might believe that the Voidbringers\nstill existed, haunting mankind. But Jasnah the skeptic? Jasnah, who denied\nthe existence of the Almighty? Could the woman really be so twisted as to\ndeny the existence of God, but accept the existence of his mythological\nenemies?\nA knock came at the outer door.

Then, flustered, she hurried out to the door. Jasnah\nwouldn’t knock, you silly fool, she told herself, unlocking and opening the\ndoor a crack.\nKabsal stood outside. The handsome, lighteyed ardent held up a\nbasket. “I’ve heard reports that you have the day free.” He shook the basket\ntemptingly. “Would you like some jam?”\nShallan calmed herself, then glanced back at Jasnah’s open quarters.\nShe really should investigate more. She turned to Kabsal, meaning to tell\nhim no, but his eyes were so inviting. That hint of a smile on his face, that\ngood-natured and relaxed posture.\nIf Shallan went with Kabsal, maybe she could ask him what he knew\nregarding Soulcasters. That wasn’t what decided it for her, however, The\ntruth was, she needed to relax. She’d been so on edge lately, brain stuffed\nwith philosophy, every spare moment spent trying to make the Soulcaster\nwork. Was it any wonder she was hearing voices?\n“I’d love some jam,” she declared.\n“Truthberry jam,” Kabsal said, holding up the small green jar. “It’s Azish.\nLegends there say that those who consume the berries speak only the truth\nuntil the next sunset.”\nShallan raised an eyebrow. They were seated on cushions atop a\nblanket in the Conclave gardens, not far from where she’d first\nexperimented with the Soulcaster. “And is it true?”\n“Hardly,” Kabsal said, opening the jar. “The berries are harmless. But\nthe leaves and stalks of the truthberry plant, if burned, give off a smoke that\nmakes people intoxicated and euphoric. It appears that peoples often\ngathered the stalks for making fires. They’d eat the berries around the\ncampfire and have a rather…interesting night.”\n“It’s a wonder—” Shallan began, then bit her lip.\n“What?” he prodded.\nShe sighed. “It’s a wonder they didn’t become known as birthberries,\nconsidering—” She blushed.\nHe laughed. “That’s a good point!”\n“Stormfather,” she said, blushing further. “I’m terrible at being proper.\nHere, give me some of that jam.”\nHe smiled, handing over a slice of bread with green jam slathered\nacross the top. A dull-eyed parshman—appropriated from inside the\nConclave—sat on the ground beside a shalebark wall, acting as an\nimpromptu chaperone. It felt so strange to be out with a man near her own\nage with only a single parshman in attendance. It felt liberating.\nExhilarating. Or maybe that was just the sunlight and the open air.\n“I’m also terrible at being scholarly,” she said, closing her eyes,\nbreathing deeply. “I like it outside far too much.”\n“Many of the greatest scholars spent their lives traveling.”\n“And for each one of them,” Shallan said, “there were a hundred more\nstuck back in a hole of a library, buried in books.”\n“And they wouldn’t have had it any other way.

That\nmakes you intriguing.”\nShe opened her eyes, smiling at him, then took a luscious bite of her\njam and bread. This Thaylen bread was so fluffy, it was more like cake.\n“So,” she said as he chewed on his bite, “do you feel any more\ntruthful, now that you’ve had the jam?”\n“I am an ardent,” he said. “It is my duty and calling to be truthful at all\ntimes.”\n“Of course,” she said. “I’m always truthful as well. So full of truth, in\nfact, that sometimes it squeezes the lies right out my lips. There isn’t a place\nfor them inside, you see.”\nHe laughed heartily. “Shallan Davar. I can’t imagine anyone as sweet\nas yourself uttering a single untruth.”\n“Then for the sake of your sanity, I’ll keep them coming in pairs.” She\nsmiled. “I’m having a terrible time, and this food is awful.”\n“You’ve just disproven an entire body of lore and mythology\nsurrounding the eating of truthberry jam!”\n“Good,” Shallan said. “Jam should not have lore or mythology. It\nshould be sweet, colorful, and delicious.”\n“Like young ladies, I presume.”\n“Brother Kabsal!” She blushed again. “That wasn’t at all appropriate.”\n“And yet you smile.”\n“I can’t help it,” she said. “I’m sweet, colorful, and delicious.”\n“You have the colorful part right,” he said, obviously amused at her\ndeep blush. “And the sweet part. Can’t speak for your deliciousness….”\n“Kabsal!” she exclaimed, though she wasn’t entirely shocked. She’d\nonce told herself that he was interested in her only in order to protect her\nsoul, but that was getting more and more difficult to believe. He stopped by\nat least once a week.\nHe chuckled at her embarrassment, but that only made her blush\nfurther.\n“Stop it!” She held her hand up in front of her eyes. “My face must be\nthe color of my hair! You shouldn’t say such things; you’re a man of\nreligion.”\n“But still a man, Shallan.”\n“One who said his interest in me was only academic.”\n“Yes, academic,” he said idly. “Involving many experiments and much\nfirsthand field research.”\n“Kabsal!”\nHe laughed deeply, taking a bite of his bread. “I’m sorry, Brightness\nShallan. But it gets such a reaction!”\nShe grumbled, lowering her hand, but knew that he said the things—in\npart—because she encouraged him. She couldn’t help it. Nobody had ever\nshown her the kind of interest that he, increasingly, did. She liked him—\nliked talking with him, liked listening to him. It was a wonderful way to\nbreak the monotony of study.\nThere was, of course, no prospect for a union. Assuming she could\nprotect her family, she’d be needed to make a good political marriage."

Unfortunately.”\nKabsal looked into her eyes, searching for something. What did he\nsee? “You don’t seem to care for your father much.”\n“Another truthful statement. The berries are working on both of us, I\nsee.”\n“He’s a hurtful man, I gather?”\n“Yes, though never to me. I’m too precious. His ideal, perfect\ndaughter. You see, my father is precisely the type of man to hang a picture\nfacing the wrong way. That way, it can’t be soiled by unworthy eyes or\ntouched by unworthy fingers.”\n“That’s a shame. As you look very touchable to me.”\nShe glared. “I told you, no more of that teasing.”\n“That wasn’t teasing,” he said, regarding her with deep blue eyes.\nEarnest eyes. “You intrigue me, Shallan Davar.”\nShe found her heart thumping. Oddly, a panic rose within her at the\nsame time. “I shouldn’t be intriguing.”\n“Why not?”\n“Logic puzzles are intriguing. Mathematical computations can be\nintriguing. Political maneuvers are intriguing. But women…they should be\nnothing short of baffling.”\n“And what if I think I’m beginning to understand you?”\n“Then I’m at a severe disadvantage,” she said. “As I don’t understand\nmyself.”\nHe smiled.\n“We shouldn’t be talking like this, Kabsal. You’re an ardent.”\n“A man can leave the ardentia, Shallan.”\nShe felt a jolt. He looked steadily at her, not blinking. Handsome, soft-"

        "text": "“A man can leave the ardentia, Shallan.”\nShe felt a jolt. He looked steadily at her, not blinking. Handsome, soft-\nspoken, witty. This could grow very dangerous very quickly, she thought.\n“Jasnah thinks you’re getting close to me because you want her\nSoulcaster,” Shallan blurted out. Then she winced. Idiot! That’s your\nresponse when a man hints that he might leave the service of the Almighty\nin order to be with you?\n“Brightness Jasnah is quite clever,” Kabsal said, slicing himself\nanother piece of bread.\nShallan blinked. “Oh, er. You mean she’s right?”\n“Right and wrong,” Kabsal said. “The devotary would very, very much\nlike to get that fabrial. I planned to ask your help eventually.”\n“But?”\n“But my superiors thought it was a terrible idea.” He grimaced. “They\nthink the king of Alethkar is volatile enough that he’d march to war with\nKharbranth over that. Soulcasters aren’t Shardblades, but they can be\nequally important.” He shook his head, taking a bite of bread. “Elhokar\nKholin should be ashamed to let his sister use that fabrial, particularly so\ntrivially. But if we were to steal it…Well, the repercussions could be felt\nacross all of Vorin Roshar.”\n“Is that so?” Shallan said, feeling sick.\nHe nodded. “Most people don’t think about it. I didn’t. Kings rule and\nwar with Shards—but their armies subsist through Soulcasters. Do you have\nany idea the kinds of supply lines and support personnel Soulcasters\nreplace? Without them, warfare is virtually impossible. You’d need\nhundreds of wagons filled with food every month!”\n“I guess…that would be a problem.” She took a deep breath. “They\nfascinate me, these Soulcasters. I’ve always wondered what it would feel\nlike to use one.”\n“I as well.”\n“So you’ve never used one?”\nHe shook his head. “There aren’t any in Kharbranth.”\nRight, she thought. Of course. That’s why the king needed Jasnah to\nhelp his granddaughter. “Have you ever heard anyone talk about using\none?” She cringed at the bold statement. Would it make him suspicious?\nHe just nodded idly. “There’s a secret to it, Shallan.”\n“Really?” she asked, heart in her throat.\nHe looked up at her, seeming conspiratorial. “It’s really not that\ndifficult.”\n“It…What?”\n“It’s true,” he said. “I’ve heard it from several ardents. There’s so\nmuch shadow and ritual surrounding Soulcasters. They’re kept mysterious,\naren’t used where people can see. But the truth is, there’s not much to them.\nYou just put one on, press your hand against something, and tap a gemstone\nwith your finger. It works that simply.”\n“That’s not how Jasnah does it,” she said, perhaps too defensively.\n“Yes, that confused me, but supposedly if you use one long enough,\nyou learn how to control them better.” He shook his head. “I don’t like the\nmystery that has grown up around them.

We’d better not find ourselves treading\ndown that path again. What would it matter if people knew how simple the\nSoulcasters are to use? The principles and gifts of the Almighty are often\nsimple.”\nShallan barely listened to that last part. Unfortunately, it seemed that\nKabsal was as ignorant as she. More ignorant, even. She’d tried the exact\nmethod he spoke of, and it didn’t work. Perhaps the ardents he knew were\nlying to protect the secret.\n“Anyway,” Kabsal said, “I guess that’s a tangent. You asked me about\nstealing the Soulcaster, and rest assured, I wouldn’t put you in that position.\nI was foolish to think of it, and I was shortly forbidden to attempt it. I was\nordered to care for your soul and see that you weren’t corrupted by Jasnah’s\nteachings, and perhaps try to reclaim Jasnah’s soul as well.”\n“Well, that last one is going to be difficult.”\n“I hadn’t noticed,” he replied dryly.\nShe smiled, though she couldn’t quite decide how to feel. “I kind of\nkilled the moment, didn’t I? Between us?”\n“I’m glad you did,” he said, dusting off his hands. “I get carried away,\nShallan. At times, I wonder if I’m as bad at being an ardent as you are at\nbeing proper. I don’t want to be presumptuous. It’s just that the way you\nspeak, it gets my mind churning, and my tongue starts saying whatever\ncomes to it.”\n“And so…”\n“And so we should call it a day,” Kabsal said, standing. “I need time to\nthink.”\nShallan stood as well, holding out her freehand for his assistance;\nstanding up in a sleek Vorin dress was difficult. They were in a section of\nthe gardens where the shalebark wasn’t quite so high, so once standing,\nShallan could see that the king himself was passing nearby, chatting with a\nmiddle-aged ardent who had a long, narrow face.\nThe king often went strolling through the gardens on his midday walk.\nShe waved to him, but the kindly man didn’t see her. He was deep in\nconversation with the ardent. Kabsal turned, noticed the king, then ducked\ndown.\n“What?” Shallan said.\n“The king keeps careful track of his ardents. He and Brother Ixil think\nI’m on cataloging duty today.”\nShe found herself smiling. “You’re scrapping your day’s work to go on\na picnic with me?”\n“Yes.”\n“I thought you were supposed to spend time with me,” she said,\nfolding her arms. “To protect my soul.”\n“I was. But there are those among the ardents who worry that I’m a\nlittle too interested in you.”\n“They’re right.”\n“I’ll come see you tomorrow,” he said, peeking up over the top of the\nshalebark. “Assuming I’m not stuck in indexing all day as a punishment.”\nHe smiled at her. “If I decide to leave the ardentia, that is my choice, and"

Perhaps because she was growing less\nand less certain what she wanted. Shouldn’t she be focused on helping her\nfamily?\nBy now, Jasnah likely had discovered that her Soulcaster didn’t work,\nbut saw no advantage in revealing it. Shallan should leave. She could go to\nJasnah and use the terrible experience in the alleyway as an excuse to quit.\nAnd yet, she was terribly reluctant. Kabsal was part of that, but he\nwasn’t the main reason. The truth was that, despite her occasional\ncomplaints, she loved learning to be a scholar. Even after Jasnah’s\nphilosophical training, even after spending days reading book after book.\nEven with the confusion and the stress, Shallan often felt fulfilled in a way\nshe’d never been before. Yes, Jasnah had been wrong to kill those men, but\nShallan wanted to know enough about philosophy to cite the correct reasons\nwhy. Yes, digging through historical records could be tedious, but Shallan\nappreciated the skills and patience she was learning; they were sure to be of\nvalue when she got to do her own deep research in the future.\nDays spent learning, lunches spent laughing with Kabsal, evenings\nchatting and debating with Jasnah. That was what she wanted. And those\nwere the parts of her life that were complete lies.\nTroubled, she picked up the basket of bread and jam, then made her\nway back to the Conclave and Jasnah’s suite. An envelope addressed to her\nsat in the waiting bin. Shallan frowned, breaking the seal to look inside.\nLass, it read. We got your message. The Wind’s Pleasure will soon be\nat port in Kharbranth again. Of course we’ll give you passage and return to\nyour estates. It would be my pleasure to have you aboard. We are Davar\nmen, we are. Indebted to your family.\nWe’re making a quick trip over to the mainland, but will hurry to\nKharbranth next. Expect us in one week’s time to pick you up.\n—Captain Tozbek\nThe undertext, written by Tozbek’s wife, read even more clearly. We’d\nhappily give you free passage, Brightness, if you’re willing to do some\nscribing for us during the trip. The ledgers badly need to be rewritten.\nShallan stared at the note for a long time. She’d wanted to know where\nhe was and when he was planning to return, but he’d apparently taken her\nletter as a request to come and pick her up.\nIt seemed a fitting deadline. That would put her departure at three\nweeks after stealing the Soulcaster, as she’d told Nan Balat to expect. If\nJasnah hadn’t reacted to the Soulcaster switch by then, Shallan would have\nto take it to mean that she wasn’t under suspicion.\nOne week. She would be on that ship.

She lowered the paper and left the guest\nhallway, her steps taking her through the twisting corridors into the Veil.\nShortly, she stood outside Jasnah’s alcove. The princess sat at her desk,\nreed scratching at a notebook. She glanced up. “I thought I told you that\nyou could do whatever you want today.”\n“You did,” Shallan said. “And I realized that what I want to do is\nstudy.”\nJasnah smiled in a sly, understanding way. Almost a self-satisfied way.\nIf she only knew. “Well, I’m not going to chide you for that,” Jasnah said,\nturning back to her research.\nShallan sat, offering the bread and jam to Jasnah, who shook her head\nand continued researching. Shallan cut herself another slice and topped it\nwith jam. Then she opened a book and sighed in satisfaction.\nIn one week, she’d have to leave. But in the meantime, she would let\nherself pretend a little while longer.\n“They lived out in the wilds, always awaiting the Desolation—or\nsometimes, a foolish child who took no heed of the night’s darkness.”\n—A child’s tale, yes, but this quote from Shadows Remembered seems\nto hint at the truth I seek. See page 82, the fourth tale.\nKaladin awoke to a familiar feeling of dread.\nHe’d spent much of the night lying awake on the hard floor, staring up\ninto the dark, thinking. Why try? Why care? There is no hope for these men.\nHe felt like a wanderer seeking desperately for a pathway into the city\nto escape wild beasts. But the city was atop a steep mountain, and no matter\nhow he approached, the climb was always the same. Impossible. A hundred\ndifferent paths. The same result.\nSurviving his punishment would not save his men. Training them to\nrun faster would not save them. They were bait. The efficiency of the bait\ndid not change its purpose or its fate.\nKaladin forced himself to his feet. He felt ground down, like a\nmillstone used far too long. He still didn’t understand how he’d survived.\nDid you preserve me, Almighty? Save me so that I could watch them die?\nYou were supposed to burn prayers to send them to the Almighty, who\nwaited for his Heralds to recapture the Tranquiline Halls. That had never\nmade sense to Kaladin. The Almighty was supposed to be able to see all and\nknow all. So why did he need a prayer burned before he would do\nanything? Why did he need people to fight for him in the first place?\nKaladin left the barrack, stepping into the light. Then he froze.\nThe men were lined up, waiting. A ragged bunch of bridgemen,\nwearing brown leather vests and short trousers that only reached their\nknees. Dirty shirts, sleeves rolled to the elbows, lacing down the front.\nDusty skin, mops of ragged hair. And yet now, because of Rock’s gift, they\nall had neatly trimmed beards or clean-shaven faces.

But their faces were clean.\nKaladin raised a hesitant hand to his face, touching his unkempt black\nbeard. The men seemed to be waiting for something. “What?” he asked.\nThe men shifted uncomfortably, glancing toward the lumberyard. They\nwere waiting for him to lead them in practice, of course. But practice was\nfutile. He opened his mouth to tell them that, but hesitated as he saw\nsomething approaching. Four men, carrying a palanquin. A tall, thin man in\na violet lighteyes’s coat walked beside it.\nThe men turned to look. “What’s this?” Hobber asked, scratching at his\nthick neck.\n“It will be Lamaril’s replacement,” Kaladin said, gently pushing his\nway through the line of bridgemen. Syl flitted down and landed on his\nshoulder as the palanquin bearers stopped before Kaladin and turned to the\nside, revealing a dark-haired woman wearing a sleek violet dress decorated\nwith golden glyphs. She lounged on her side, resting on a cushioned couch,\nher eyes a pale blue.\n“I am Brightness Hashal,” she said, voice lightly touched by a\nKholinar accent. “My husband, Brightlord Matal, is your new captain.”\nKaladin held his tongue, biting back a remark. He had some\nexperience with lighteyes who got “promoted” to positions like this one.\nMatal himself said nothing, simply standing with his hand resting on the hilt\nof his sword. He was tall—nearly as tall as Kaladin—but spindly. Delicate\nhands. That sword hadn’t seen much practice.\n“We have been advised,” Hashal said, “that this crew has been\ntroublesome.” Her eyes narrowed, focusing on Kaladin. “It seems that you\nhave survived the Almighty’s judgment. I bear a message for you from your\nbetters. The Almighty has given you another chance to prove yourself as a\nbridgeman. That is all. Many are trying to read too much into what\nhappened, so Highprince Sadeas has forbidden gawkers to come see you.\n“My husband does not intend to run the bridge crews with his\npredecessor’s laxness. My husband is a well-respected and honored\nassociate of Highprince Sadeas himself, not some near-darkeyed mongrel\nlike Lamaril.”\n“Is that so?” Kaladin said. “Then how did he end up in this latrine pit\nof a job?”\nHashal didn’t display a hint of anger at the comment. She flicked her\nfingers to the side, and one of the soldiers stepped forward and rammed the\nbutt of his spear toward Kaladin’s stomach.\nKaladin caught it, old reflexes still too keen. Possibilities flashed\nthrough his mind, and he could see the fight before it took place.\nYank on the spear, throw the soldier off guard.\nStep forward and ram an elbow into his forearm, making him drop the\nweapon.\nTake control, spin the spear up and slam the soldier on the side of the\nhead.\nSpin into a sweep to drop the two who came to help their companion.\nRaise the spear for the—\nNo. That would only get Kaladin killed.\nKaladin released the butt of the spear.

The soldier blinked in surprise\nthat a mere bridgeman had blocked his blow. Scowling, the soldier jerked\nthe butt up and slammed it into the side of Kaladin’s head.\nKaladin let it hit him, rolling with it, allowing it to toss him to the\nground. His head rang from the shock, but his eyesight stopped spinning\nafter a moment. He’d have a headache, but probably no concussion.\nHe took in a few deep breaths, lying on the ground, hands forming\nfists. His fingers seemed to burn where he had touched the spear. The\nsoldier stepped back into position beside the palanquin.\n“No laxness,” Hashal said calmly. “If you must know, my husband\nrequested this assignment. The bridge crews are essential to Brightlord\nSadeas’s advantage in the War of Reckoning. Their mismanagement under\nLamaril was disgraceful.”\nRock knelt down, helping Kaladin to his feet while scowling at the\nlighteyes and their soldiers. Kaladin stumbled up, holding his hand to the\nside of his head. His fingers felt slick and wet, and a trickle of warm blood\nran down his neck to his shoulder.\n“From now on,” Hashal said, “aside from doing normal bridge duty,\neach crew will be assigned only one type of work duty. Gaz!”\nThe short bridge sergeant poked out from behind the palanquin.\nKaladin hadn’t noticed him there, behind the porters and the soldiers. “Yes,\nBrightness?” Gaz bowed several times.\n“My husband wishes Bridge Four to be assigned chasm duty\npermanently. Whenever they are not needed for bridge duty, I want them\nworking in those chasms. This will be far more efficient. They will know\nwhich sections have been scoured recently, and will not cover the same\nground. You see? Efficiency. They will start immediately.”\nShe rapped on the side of her palanquin, and the porters turned,\nbearing her away. Her husband continued to walk alongside her without\nsaying a word, and Gaz hurried to keep up. Kaladin stared after them,\nholding his hand to his head. Dunny ran and fetched him a bandage.\n“Chasm duty,” Moash grumbled. “Great job, lordling. She’d see us\ndead from a chasmfiend if the Parshendi arrows don’t take us.”\n“What are we going to do?” asked lean, balding Peet, his voice edged\nwith worry.\n“We get to work,” Kaladin said, taking the bandage from Dunny.\nHe walked away, leaving them in a frightened clump.\nA short time later, Kaladin stood at the edge of the chasm, looking down.\nThe hot light of the noon sun burned the back of his neck and cast his\nshadow downward into the rift, to join with those below. I could fly, he\nthought. Step off and fall, wind blowing against me. Fly for a few moments.\nA few, beautiful moments.\nHe knelt and grabbed the rope ladder, then climbed down into the\ndarkness.

He’d clung to the bridgemen as a lifeline. But he was letting go\nnow.\nAs he stepped down the rungs, a faint translucent figure of blue and\nwhite dropped beside him, sitting on a swinglike seat. Its ropes disappeared\na few inches above Syl’s head.\n“What is wrong with you?” she asked softly.\nKaladin just kept climbing down.\n“You should be happy. You survived the storms. The other bridgemen\nwere so excited.”\n“I itched to fight that soldier,” Kaladin whispered.\nSyl cocked her head.\n“I could have beaten him,” Kaladin continued. “I probably could have\nbeaten all four of them. I’ve always been good with the spear. No, not good.\nDurk called me amazing. A natural born soldier, an artist with the spear.”\n“Maybe you should have fought them, then.”\n“I thought you didn’t like killing.”\n“I hate it,” she said, growing more translucent. “But I’ve helped men\nkill before.”\nKaladin froze on the ladder. “What?”\n“It’s true,” she said. “I can remember it, just faintly.”\n“How?”\n“I don’t know.” She grew paler. “I don’t want to talk about it. But it\nwas right to do. I feel it.”\nKaladin hung for a moment longer. Teft called down, asking if\nsomething was wrong. He started to descend again.\n“I didn’t fight the soldiers today,” Kaladin said, eyes toward the chasm\nwall, “because it wouldn’t work. My father told me that it is impossible to\nprotect by killing. Well, he was wrong.”\n“But—”\n“He was wrong,” Kaladin said, “because he implied that you could\nprotect people in other ways. You can’t. This world wants them dead, and\ntrying to save them is pointless.” He reached the bottom of the chasm,\nstepping into darkness. Teft reached the bottom next and lit his torch,\nbathing the moss-covered stone walls in flickering orange light.\n“Is that why you didn’t accept it?” Syl whispered, flitting over and\nlanding on Kaladin’s shoulder. “The glory. All those months ago?”\nKaladin shook his head. “No. That was something else.”\n“What did you say, Kaladin?” Teft raised the torch. The aging\nbridgeman’s face looked older than usual in the flickering light, the\nshadows it created emphasizing the furrows in his skin.\n“Nothing, Teft,” Kaladin said. “Nothing important.”\nSyl sniffed at that. Kaladin ignored her, lighting his torch from Teft’s\nas the other bridgemen arrived. When they were all down, Kaladin led the\nway out into the dark rift.

Kaladin walked in front, and Syl fell silent. He gave Teft the\nchalk to mark directions, and didn’t pause to pick up salvage. But neither\ndid he walk too quickly. The other bridgemen were hushed behind them,\nspeaking in occasional whispers too low to echo. As if their words were\nstrangled by the gloom.\nRock eventually moved up to walk beside Kaladin. “Is difficult job, we\nhave been given. But we are bridgemen! Life, it is difficult, eh? Is nothing\nnew. We must have plan. How do we fight next?”\n“There is no next fight, Rock.”\n“But we have won grand victory! Look, not days ago, you were\ndelirious. You should have died. I know this thing. But instead, you walk,\nstrong as any other man. Ha! Stronger. Is miracle. The Uli’tekanaki guide\nyou.”\n“It’s not a miracle, Rock,” Kaladin said. “It’s more of a curse.”\n“How is that a curse, my friend?” Rock asked, chuckling. He jumped\nup and into a puddle and laughed louder as it splashed Teft, who was\nwalking just behind. The large Horneater could be remarkably childlike at\ntimes. “Living, this thing is no curse!”\n“It is if it brings me back to watch you all die,” Kaladin said. “Better I\nshouldn’t have survived that storm. I’m just going to end up dead from a\nParshendi arrow. We all are.”\nRock looked troubled. When Kaladin offered nothing more, he\nwithdrew. They continued, uncomfortably passing sections of scarred wall\nwhere chasmfiends had left their marks. Eventually they stumbled across a\nheap of bodies deposited by the highstorms. Kaladin stopped, holding up\nhis torch, the other bridgemen peeking around him. Some fifty people had\nbeen washed into a recess in the rock, a small dead-end side passage in the\nstone.\nThe bodies were piled there, a wall of the dead, arms hanging out,\nreeds and flotsam stuck between them. Kaladin saw at a glance that the\ncorpses were old enough to begin bloating and rotting. Behind him, one of\nthe men retched, which caused a few of the others to do so as well. The\nscent was terrible, the corpses slashed and ripped into by cremlings and\nlarger carrion beasts, many of which scuttled away from the light. A\ndisembodied hand lay nearby, and a trail of blood led away. There were also\nfresh scrapes in the lichen as high as fifteen feet up the wall. A chasmfiend\nhad ripped one of the bodies loose to devour. It might come back for the\nothers.\nKaladin didn’t retch. He shoved his half-burned torch between two\nlarge stones, then got to work, pulling bodies from the pile. At least they\nweren’t rotted enough to come apart. The bridgemen slowly filled in around\nhim, working. Kaladin let his mind grow numb, not thinking.\nOnce the bodies were down, the bridgemen laid them in a line. Then"

Kaladin caught a few\nof them grumbling. “Bastard,” Moash said. “I said this would happen.”\n“Abandoning you?” Kaladin hissed to Teft. Just let me be. Let me go\nback to apathy. At least then there’s no pain. “Teft, I’ve spent hours and\nhours trying to find a way out, but there isn’t one! Sadeas wants us dead.\nLighteyes get what they want; that’s the way the world works.”\n“So?”\nKaladin ignored him, turning back to his work, pulling at the boot on a\nsoldier whose fibula looked to have been shattered in three different places.\nThat made it storming awkward to get the boot off.\n“Well, maybe we will die,” Teft said. “But maybe this isn’t about\nsurviving.”\nWhy was Teft—of all people—trying to cheer him up? “If survival\nisn’t the point, Teft, then what is?” Kaladin finally got the boot off. He\nturned to the next body in line, then froze.\nIt was a bridgeman. Kaladin didn’t recognize him, but that vest and\nthose sandals were unmistakable. He lay slumped against the wall, arms at\nhis sides, mouth slightly open and eyelids sunken. The skin on one of the\nhands had slipped free and pulled away.\n“I don’t know what the point is,” Teft grumbled. “But it seems pathetic\nto give up. We should keep fighting. Right until those arrows take us. You"

Right until those arrows take us. You\nknow, ‘journey before destination.’”\n“What does that mean?”\n“I don’t know,” Teft said, looking down quickly. “Just something I\nheard once.”\n“It’s something the Lost Radiants used to say,” Sigzil said, walking\npast.\nKaladin glanced to the side. The soft-spoken Azish man set a shield on\na pile. He looked up, brown skin dark in the torchlight. “It was their motto.\nPart of it, at least. ‘Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey\nbefore destination.’”\n“Lost Radiants?” Skar said, carrying an armful of boots. “Who’s\nbringing them up?”\n“Teft did,” Moash said.\n“I did not! That was just something I heard once.”\n“What does it even mean?” Dunny asked.\n“I said I don’t know!” Teft said.\n“It was supposedly one of their creeds,” Sigzil said. “In Yulay, there\nare groups of people who talk of the Radiants. And wish for their return.”\n“Who’d want them to return?” Skar said, leaning back against the wall,\nfolding his arms. “They betrayed us to the Voidbringers.”\n“Ha!” Rock said. “Voidbringers! Lowlander nonsense. Is campfire tale\ntold by children.”\n“They were real,” Skar said defensively. “Everyone knows that.”\n“Everyone who listens to campfire stories!” Rock said with a laugh.\n“Too much air! Makes your minds soft. Is all right, though—you are still\nmy family. Just the dumb ones!”\nTeft scowled as the others continued to talk about the Lost Radiants.\n“Journey before destination,” Syl whispered on Kaladin’s shoulder. “I\nlike that.”\n“Why?” Kaladin asked, kneeling down to untie the dead bridgeman’s\nsandals.\n“Because,” she replied, as if that were explanation enough. “Teft is\nright, Kaladin. I know you want to give up. But you can’t.”\n“Why not?”\n“Because you can’t.”\n“We’re assigned to chasm duty from now on,” Kaladin said. “We\nwon’t be able to collect any more reeds to make money. That means no\nmore bandages, antiseptic, or food for the nightly meals. With all of these\nbodies, we’re bound to run into rotspren, and the men will grow sick—\nassuming chasmfiends don’t eat us or a surprise highstorm doesn’t drown\nus. And we’ll have to keep running those bridges until Damnation ends,\nlosing man after man. It’s hopeless.”\nThe men were still talking. “The Lost Radiants helped the other side,”\nSkar argued. “They were tarnished all along.”\nTeft took offense at that. The wiry man stood up straight, pointing at\nSkar. “You don’t know anything! It was too long ago. Nobody knows what\nreally happened.”\n“Then why do all the stories say the same thing?” Skar demanded.\n“They abandoned us. Just like the lighteyes are abandoning us right now."

Maybe there is no hope.”\nKaladin looked down. Those words haunted him. Maybe Kaladin is\nright…maybe there is no hope….\nHe’d done this before. Under his last own er, before being sold to\nTvlakv and being made a bridgeman. He’d given up on a quiet night after\nleading Goshel and the other slaves in rebellion. They’d been slaughtered.\nBut somehow he’d survived. Storm it all, why did he always survive? I\ncan’t do it again, he thought, squeezing his eyes shut. I can’t help them.\nTien. Tukks. Goshel. Dallet. The nameless slave he’d tried to heal in\nTvlakv’s slave wagons. All had ended up the same. Kaladin had the touch\nof failure. Sometimes he gave them hope, but what was hope except another\nopportunity for failure? How many times could a man fall before he no\nlonger stood back up?\n“I just think we’re ignorant,” Teft grumbled. “I don’t like listening to\nwhat the lighteyes say about the past. Their women write all the histories,\nyou know.”\n“I can’t believe you’re arguing about this, Teft,” Skar said,\nexasperated. “What next? Should we let the Voidbringers steal our hearts?\nMaybe they’re just misunderstood. Or the Parshendi. Maybe we should just\nlet them kill our king whenever they want.”\n“Would you two just storm off?” Moash snapped. “It doesn’t matter.\nYou heard Kaladin. Even he thinks we’re as good as dead.”\nKaladin couldn’t take their voices anymore. He stumbled away, into\nthe darkness, away from the torchlight. None of the men followed him. He\nentered a place of dark shadows, with only the distant ribbon of sky above\nfor light.\nHere, Kaladin escaped their eyes. In the darkness he ran into a boulder,\nstumbling to a stop. It was slick with moss and lichen. He stood with his\nhands pressed against it, then groaned and turned around to lean back\nagainst it. Syl alighted in front of him, still visible, despite the darkness. She\nsat down in the air, arranging her dress around her legs.\n“I can’t save them, Syl,” Kaladin whispered, anguished.\n“Are you certain?”\n“I’ve failed every time before.”\n“And so you’ll fail this time too?”\n“Yes.”\nShe fell silent. “Well then,” she eventually said. “Let’s say that you’re\nright.”\n“So why fight? I told myself that I would try one last time. But I failed\nbefore I began. There’s no saving them.”\n“Doesn’t the fight itself mean anything?”\n“Not if you’re destined to die.” He hung his head.\nSigzil’s words echoed in his head. Life before death. Strength before\nweakness. Journey before destination. Kaladin looked up at the crack of\nsky. Like a faraway river of pure, blue water.\nLife before death.\nWhat did the saying mean?

Or did it mean something else? That life came\nbefore death? Again, obvious. And yet the simple words spoke to him.\nDeath comes, they whispered. Death comes to all. But life comes first.\nCherish it.\nDeath is the destination. But the journey, that is life. That is what\nmatters.\nA cold wind blew through the corridor of stone, washing over him,\nbringing crisp, fresh scents and blowing away the stink of rotting corpses.\nNobody cared for the bridgemen. Nobody cared for those at the\nbottom, with the darkest eyes. And yet, that wind seemed to whisper to him\nover and over. Life before death. Life before death. Live before you die.\nHis foot hit something. He bent down and picked it up. A small rock.\nHe could barely make it out in the darkness. He recognized what was\nhappening to him, this melancholy, this sense of despair. It had taken him\noften when he’d been younger, most frequently during the weeks of the\nWeeping, when the sky was hidden by clouds. During those times, Tien had\ncheered him up, helped him pull out of his despair. Tien had always been\nable to do that.\nOnce he’d lost his brother, he’d dealt with these periods of sadness\nmore awkwardly. He’d become the wretch, not caring—but also not\ndespairing. It had seemed better not to feel at all, as opposed to feeling pain.\nI’m going to fail them, Kaladin thought, squeezing his eyes shut. Why\ntry?\nWasn’t he a fool to keep grasping as he did? If only he could win once.\nThat would be enough. As long as he could believe that he could help\nsomeone, as long as he believed that some paths led to places other than\ndarkness, he could hope.\nYou promised yourself you would try one last time, he thought. They\naren’t dead yet.\nStill alive. For now.\nThere was one thing he hadn’t tried. Something he’d been too\nfrightened of. Every time he’d tried it in the past, he’d lost everything.\nThe wretch seemed to be standing before him. He meant release.\nApathy. Did Kaladin really want to go back to that? It was a false refuge.\nBeing that man hadn’t protected him. It had only led him deeper and deeper\nuntil taking his own life had seemed the better way.\nLife before death.\nKaladin stood up, opening his eyes, dropping the small rock. He\nwalked slowly back toward the torchlight. The bridgemen looked up from\ntheir work. So many questioning eyes. Some doubtful, some grim, others\nencouraging. Rock, Dunny, Hobber, Leyten. They believed in him. He had\nsurvived the storms. One miracle granted.\n“There is something we could try,” Kaladin said. “But it will most\nlikely end with us all dead at the hands of our own army.”\n“We’re bound to end up dead anyway,” Maps noted. “You said so\nyourself.” Several of the others nodded.\nKaladin took a deep breath. “We have to try to escape.”"

They know we’d run.”\n“We’d die,” Moash said, face grim. “We’re miles and miles from\ncivilization. There’s nothing out here but greatshells, and no shelter from\nhighstorms.”\n“I know,” Kaladin said. “But it’s either this or the Parshendi arrows.”\nThe men fell silent.\n“They’re going to send us down here every day to rob corpses,”\nKaladin said. “And they don’t send us with supervision, since they fear the\nchasmfiends. Most bridgeman work is busywork, to distract us from our\nfate, so we only have to bring back a small amount of salvage.”\n“You think we should choose one of these chasms and flee down it?”\nSkar asked. “They’ve tried to map them all. The crews never reached the\nother side of the Plains—they got killed by chasmfiends or highstorm\nfloods.”\nKaladin shook his head. “That’s not what we’re going to do.” He\nkicked at something on the ground before him—a fallen spear. His kick sent\nit into the air toward Moash, who caught it, surprised.\n“I can train you to use those,” Kaladin said softly.\nThe men fell silent, looking at the weapon.\n“What good would this thing do?” Rock asked, taking the spear from\nMoash, looking it over. “We cannot fight an army.”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “But if I train you, then we can attack a guard post\nat night. We might be able to get away.” Kaladin looked at them, meeting\neach man’s eyes in turn. “Once we’re free, they’ll send soldiers after us.\nSadeas won’t let bridgemen kill his soldiers and get away with it. We’ll\nhave to hope he underestimates us and sends a small group at first. If we kill\nthem, we might be able to get far enough away to hide. It will be dangerous.\nSadeas will go to great lengths to recapture us, and we’ll likely end with an\nentire company chasing us down. Storm it, we’ll probably never escape the\ncamp in the first place. But it’s something.”\nHe fell silent, waiting as the men exchanged uncertain glances.\n“I’ll do it,” Teft said, straightening up.\n“Me too,” Moash said, stepping forward. He seemed eager.\n“And I,” Sigzil said. “I would rather spit in their Alethi faces and die\non their swords than remain a slave.”\n“Ha!” Rock said. “And I shall cook you all much food to keep you full\nwhile you kill.”\n“You won’t fight with us?” Dunny asked, surprised.\n“Is beneath me,” Rock said raising his chin.\n“Well, I’ll do it,” Dunny said. “I’m your man, Captain.”\nOthers began to chime in, each man standing, several grabbing spears\nfrom the wet ground.

They were frightened by the idea of fighting—most had\nbeen common slaves or lowly workmen. But they were willing.\nKaladin stepped forward and began to outline a plan.\nFIVE YEARS AGO\nKaladin hated the Weeping. It marked the end of an old year and the coming\nof a new one, four solid weeks of rain in a ceaseless cascade of sullen\ndrops. Never furious, never passionate like a highstorm. Slow, steady. Like\nthe blood of a dying year that was taking its last few shambling steps\ntoward the cairn. While other seasons of weather came and went\nunpredictably, the Weeping never failed to return at the same time each\nyear. Unfortunately.\nKaladin lay on the sloped roof of his house in Hearthstone. A small\npail of pitch sat next to him, covered by a piece of wood. It was almost\nempty now that he’d finished patching the roof. The Weeping was a\nmiserable time to do this work, but it was also when a persistent leak could\nbe most irritating. They’d repatch when the Weeping ended, but at least this\nway they wouldn’t have to suffer a steady stream of drips onto their dining\ntable for the next weeks.\nHe lay on his back, staring up at the sky. Perhaps he should have\nclimbed down and gone inside, but he was already soaked through. So he\nstayed. Watching, thinking.\nAnother army was passing through the town. One of many these days\n—they often came during the Weeping, resupplying and moving to new\nbattlefields. Roshone had made a rare appearance to welcome the warlord:\nHighmarshal Amaram himself, apparently a distant cousin as well as head\nof Alethi defense in this area. He was of the most renowned soldiers still in\nAlethkar; most had left for the Shattered Plains.\nThe small raindrops misted Kaladin. Many of the others liked these\nweeks—there were no highstorms, save for one right in the middle. To the\ntownspeople, it was a cherished time to rest from farming and relax. But\nKaladin longed for the sun and the wind. He actually missed the\nhighstorms, with their rage and vitality. These days were dreary, and he\nfound it difficult to get anything productive done. As if the lack of storms\nleft him without strength.\nFew people had seen much of Roshone since the ill-fated whitespine\nhunt and the death of his son. He hid in his mansion, increasingly reclusive.\nThe people of Hearthstone trod very lightly, as if they expected that any\nmoment he could explode and turn his rage against them. Kaladin wasn’t\nworried about that. A storm—whether from a person or the sky—was\nsomething you could react to. But this suffocation, this slow and steady\ndousing of life…That was far, far worse.\n“Kaladin?” Tien’s voice called. “Are you still up there?”\n“Yeah,” he called back, not moving. The clouds were so bland during\nthe Weeping. Could anything be more lifeless than that miserable grey?\nTien rounded to the back of the building, where the roof sloped down"

        "text": "“Yeah,” he called back, not moving. The clouds were so bland during\nthe Weeping. Could anything be more lifeless than that miserable grey?\nTien rounded to the back of the building, where the roof sloped down\nto touch the ground. He had his hands in the pockets of his long raincoat, a\nwide-brimmed hat on his head. Both looked too large for him, but clothing\nalways seemed too large for Tien. Even when it fit him properly.\nKaladin’s brother climbed up onto the roof and walked up beside him,\nthen lay down, staring upward. Someone else might have tried to cheer\nKaladin up, and they would have failed. But somehow Tien knew the right\nthing to do. For the moment, that was keeping silent.\n“You like the rain, don’t you?” Kaladin finally asked him.\n“Yeah,” Tien said. Of course, Tien liked pretty much everything. “Hard\nto stare up at like this, though. I keep blinking.”\nFor some reason, that made Kaladin smile.\n“I made you something,” Tien said. “At the shop today.”\nKaladin’s parents were worried; Ral the carpenter had taken Tien,\nthough he didn’t really need another apprentice, and was reportedly\ndissatisfied with the boy’s work. Tien got distracted easily, Ral complained.\nKaladin sat up as Tien fished something out of his pocket. It was a\nsmall wooden horse, intricately carved.\n“Don’t worry about the water,” Tien said, handing it over. “I sealed it\nalready.”\n“Tien,” Kaladin said, amazed. “This is beautiful.” The details were\namazing—the eyes, the hooves, the lines in the tail. It looked just like the\nmajestic animals that pulled Roshone’s carriage. “Did you show this to\nRal?”\n“He said it was good,” Tien said, smiling beneath his oversized hat.\n“But he told me I should have been making a chair instead. I kind of got\ninto trouble.”\n“But how…I mean, Tien, he’s got to see this is amazing!”\n“Oh, I don’t know about that,” Tien said, still smiling. “It’s just a\nhorse. Master Ral likes things you can use. Things to sit on, things to put\nclothes in. But I think I can make a good chair tomorrow, something that\nwill make him proud.”\nKaladin looked at his brother, with his innocent face and affable\nnature. He hadn’t lost either, though he was now into his teenage years.\nHow is it you can always smile? Kaladin thought. It’s dreadful outside, your\nmaster treats you like crem, and your family is slowly being strangled by the\ncitylord. And yet you smile. How, Tien?\nAnd why is it that you make me want to smile too?\n“Father spent another of the spheres, Tien,” Kaladin found himself\nsaying. Each time their father was forced to do that, he seemed to grow a\nlittle more wan, stand a little less tall. Those spheres were dun these days,\nno light in them. You couldn’t infuse spheres during the Weeping. They all\nran out, eventually.\n“There are plenty more,” Tien said.\n“Roshone is trying to wear us down,” Kaladin said. “Bit by bit,\nsmother us.”"

You’ll see.”\nSo many objections rose in his mind, but Tien’s smile banished them.\nThere, in the midst of the dreariest part of the year, Kaladin felt for a\nmoment as if he had glimpsed sunshine. He could swear he felt things grow\nbrighter around them, the storm retreating a shade, the sky lightening.\nTheir mother rounded the back of the building. She looked up at them,\nas if amused to find them both sitting on the roof in the rain. She stepped\nonto the lower portion. A small group of haspers clung to the stone there;\nthe small two-shelled creatures proliferated during the Weeping. They\nseemed to grow out of nowhere, much like their cousins the tiny snails,\nscattered all across the stone.\n“What are you two talking about?” she asked, walking up and sitting\ndown with them. Hesina rarely acted like the other mothers in town.\nSometimes, that bothered Kaladin. Shouldn’t she have sent them into the\nhouse or something, complaining that they’d catch a cold? No, she just sat\ndown with them, wearing a brown leather raincoat.\n“Kaladin’s worried about Father spending the spheres,” Tien said.\n“Oh, I wouldn’t worry about that,” she replied. “We’ll get you to\nKharbranth. You’ll be old enough to leave in two more months.”\n“You two should come with me,” Kal said. “And Father too.”\n“And leave the town?” Tien said, as if he’d never considered that\npossibility. “But I like it here.”\nHesina smiled.\n“What?” Kaladin said.\n“Most young men your age are trying everything they can to be rid of\ntheir parents.”\n“I can’t go off and leave you here. We’re a family.”\n“He’s trying to strangle us,” Kaladin said, glancing at Tien. Talking\nwith his brother had made him feel a lot better, but his objections were still\nthere. “Nobody pays for healing, and I know nobody will pay you for work\nanymore. What kind of value does Father get for those spheres he spends\nanyway? Vegetables at ten times the regular price, moldy grain at double?”\nHesina smiled. “Observant.”\n“Father taught me to notice details. The eyes of a surgeon.”\n“Well,” she said, eyes twinkling, “did your surgeon’s eyes notice the\nfirst time we spent one of the spheres?”\n“Sure,” Kaladin said. “It was the day after the hunting accident. Father\nhad to buy new cloth to make bandages.”\n“And did we need new bandages?”\n“Well, no. But you know how Father is. He doesn’t like it when we\nstart to run even a little low.”\n“And so he spent one of those spheres,” Hesina said. “That he’d\nhoarded for months and months, butting heads with the citylord over them.”\nNot to mention going to such lengths to steal them in the first place,"

        "text": "hoarded for months and months, butting heads with the citylord over them.”\nNot to mention going to such lengths to steal them in the first place,\nKaladin thought. But you know all about that. He glanced at Tien, who was\nwatching the sky again. So far as Kal knew, his brother hadn’t discovered\nthe truth yet.\n“So your father resisted so long,” Hesina said, “only to finally break\nand spend a sphere on some cloth bandages we wouldn’t need for months.”\nShe had a point. Why had his father suddenly decided to…“He’s\nletting Roshone think he’s winning,” Kaladin said with surprise, looking\nback at her.\nHesina smiled slyly. “Roshone would have found a way to get\nretribution eventually. It wouldn’t have been easy. Your father ranks high as\na citizen, and has the right of inquest. He did save Roshone’s life, and many\ncould testify to the severity of Rillir’s wounds. But Roshone would have\nfound a way. Unless he felt he’d broken us.”\nKaladin turned toward the mansion. Though it was hidden by the\nshroud of rain, he could just make out the tents of the army camped on the\nfield below. What would it be like to live as a soldier, often exposed to\nstorms and rain, to winds and tempests? Once Kaladin would have been\nintrigued, but the life of a spearman had no call for him now. His mind was\nfilled with diagrams of muscles and memorized lists of symptoms and\ndiseases.\n“We’ll keep spending the spheres,” Hesina said. “One every few\nweeks. Partially to live, though my family has offered supplies. More to\nkeep Roshone thinking that we’re bending. And then, we send you away.\nUnexpectedly. You’ll be gone, the spheres safely in the hands of the ardents\nto use as a stipend during your years of study.”\nKaladin blinked in realization. They weren’t losing. They were\nwinning.\n“Think of it, Kaladin,” Tien said. “You’ll live in one of the grandest\ncities in the world! It will be so exciting. You’ll be a man of learning, like\nFather. You’ll have clerks to read to you from any book you want.”\nKaladin pushed wet hair off his forehead. Tien made it sound a lot\ngrander than he’d been thinking. Of course, Tien could make a crem-filled\npuddle sound grand.\n“That’s true,” his mother said, still staring upward. “You could learn\nmathematics, history, politics, tactics, the sciences…”\n“Aren’t those things women learn?” Kaladin said, frowning.\n“Lighteyed women study them. But there are male scholars as well. If\nnot as many.”\n“All this to become a surgeon.”\n“You wouldn’t have to become a surgeon. Your life is your own, son.\nIf you take the path of a surgeon, we will be proud. But don’t feel that you\nneed to live your father’s life for him.” She looked down at Kaladin,\nblinking rainwater from her eyes.\n“What else would I do?” Kaladin said, stupefied.\n“There are many professions open to men with a good mind and\ntraining.

If you really wished to study all the arts, you could become an\nardent. Or perhaps a stormwarden.”\nStormwarden. He reached by reflex for the prayer sewn to his left\nsleeve, waiting for the day he’d need to burn it for aid. “They seek to\npredict the future.”\n“It’s not the same thing. You’ll see. There are so many things to\nexplore, so many places your mind could go. The world is changing. My\nfamily’s most recent letter describes amazing fabrials, like pens that can\nwrite across great distances. It might not be long before men are taught to\nread.”\n“I’d never want to learn something like that,” Kaladin said, aghast,\nglancing at Tien. Was their own mother really saying these things? But then,\nshe’d always been like this. Free, both with her mind and her tongue.\nYet, to become a stormwarden…They studied the highstorms,\npredicted them—yes—but learned about them and their mysteries. They\nstudied the winds themselves.\n“No,” Kaladin said. “I want to be a surgeon. Like my father.”\nHesina smiled. “If that’s what you choose, then—as I said—we will be\nproud of you. But father and I just want you to know that you can choose.”\nThey sat like that for some time, letting rainwater soak them. Kaladin\nkept searching those grey clouds, wondering what it was that Tien found so\ninteresting in them. Eventually, he heard splashing below, and Lirin’s face\nappeared at the side of the house.\n“What in the…” he said. “All three of you? What are you doing up\nhere?”\n“Feasting,” Kaladin’s mother said nonchalantly.\n“On what?”\n“On irregularity, dear,” she said.\nLirin sighed. “Dear, you can be very odd, you know.”\n“And didn’t I just say that?”\n“Point. Well, come on. There’s a gathering in the square.”\nHesina frowned. She rose and walked down the slope of the roof.\nKaladin glanced at Tien, and the two of them stood. Kaladin stuffed the\nwooden horse in his pocket and picked his way down, careful on the slick\nrock, his shoes squishing. Cool water ran down Kaladin’s cheeks as he\nstepped off onto the ground.\nThey followed Lirin toward the square. Kaladin’s father looked\nworried, and he walked with the beaten-down slouch he was prone to lately.\nMaybe it was an affectation to fool Roshone, but Kaladin suspected there\nwas some truth to it. His father didn’t like having to give up those spheres,\neven if it was part of a ruse. It was too much like giving in.\nAhead, a crowd was gathering at the town square, everyone holding\numbrellas or wearing cloaks.\n“What is it, Lirin?” Hesina asked, sounding anxious.\n“Roshone is going to put in an appearance,” Lirin said. “He asked\nWaber to gather everyone. Full town meeting.”\n“In the rain?” Kaladin asked. “Couldn’t he have waited for Lightday?”"

The family walked in silence, even Tien growing\nsolemn. They passed some rainspren standing in puddles, glowing with a\nfaint blue light, shaped like ankle-high melting candles with no flame. They\nrarely appeared except during the Weeping. They were said to be the souls\nof raindrops, glowing blue rods, seeming to melt but never growing smaller,\na single blue eye at their tops.\nThe townspeople were mostly assembled, gossiping in the rain, by the\ntime Kaladin’s family arrived. Jost and Naget were there, though neither\nwaved to Kaladin; it had been years since they’d been anything resembling\nfriends. Kaladin shivered. His parents called this town home, and his father\nrefused to leave, but it felt less and less like “home” by the day.\nI’ll be leaving it soon, he thought, eager to walk out of Hearthstone\nand leave these small-minded people behind. To go to a place where\nlighteyes were men and women of honor and beauty, worthy of the high\nstation given them by the Almighty.\nRoshone’s carriage approached. It had lost much of its luster during his\nyears in Hearthstone, the golden paint flaking off, the dark wood chipped by\nroad gravel. As the carriage pulled into the square, Waber and his boys\nfinally got a small canopy erected. The rain had strengthened, and drops hit\nthe cloth with a hollow drumming sound.\nThe air smelled different with all of these people around. Up on the\nroof, it had been fresh and clean. Now it seemed muggy and humid. The\ncarriage door opened. Roshone had gained more weight, and his lighteyes’s\nsuit had been retailored to fit his increased girth. He wore a wooden peg on\nhis right stump, hidden by the cuff of his trouser, and his gait was stiff as he\nclimbed out of the carriage and ducked beneath the canopy, grumbling.\nHe hardly seemed the same person, with that beard and wet, stringy\nhair. But his eyes, they were the same. More beady now because of the\nfuller cheeks, but still seething as he studied the crowd. As if he had been\nhit with a rock when he wasn’t looking, and now searched for the culprit.\nWas Laral inside the carriage? Someone else moved inside, climbing\nout, but it turned out to be a lean man with a clean-shaven face and light tan\neyes. The dignified man wore a neatly pressed, green formal military\nuniform and had a sword at his hip. Highmarshal Amaram? He certainly\nlooked impressive, with that strong figure and square face. The difference\nbetween him and Roshone was striking.\nFinally, Laral did appear, wearing a light yellow dress of an antique\nfashion, with a flaring skirt and thick bodice. She glanced up at the rain,\nthen waited for a footman to hurry over with an umbrella. Kaladin felt his\nheart thumping. They hadn’t spoken since the day she’d humiliated him in\nRoshone’s mansion. And yet, she was gorgeous. As she had grown through\nher adolescence, she had gotten prettier and prettier. Some might find that"

Some might find that\ndark hair sprinkled with foreigner blond to be unappealing for its indication\nof mixed blood, but to Kaladin it was alluring.\nBeside Kaladin, his father stiffened, cursing softly.\n“What?” Tien asked from beside Kaladin, craning to see.\n“Laral,” Kaladin’s mother said. “She’s wearing a bride’s prayer on her\nsleeve.”\nKaladin started, seeing the white cloth with its blue glyphpair sewn\nonto the sleeve of her dress. She’d burn it when the engagement was\nformally announced.\nBut…who? Rillir was dead!\n“I’d heard rumors of this,” Kaladin’s father said. “It appears Roshone\nwasn’t willing to part with the connections she offers.”\n“Him?” Kaladin asked, stunned. Roshone himself was marrying her?\nOthers in the crowd had begun speaking as they noticed the prayer.\n“Lighteyes marry much younger women all the time,” Kaladin’s\nmother said. “For them, marriages are often about securing house loyalty.”\n“Him?” Kaladin asked again, incredulous, stepping forward. “We have\nto stop it. We have to—”\n“Kaladin,” his father said sharply.\n“But—”\n“It is their affair, not ours.”\nKaladin fell silent, feeling the larger raindrops hit his head, the smaller\nones blowing by as mist. The water ran through the square and pooled in\ndepressions. Near Kaladin, a rainspren sprang up, forming as if out of the\nwater. It stared upward, unblinking.\nRoshone leaned on his cane and nodded to Natir, his steward. The man\nwas accompanied by his wife, a stern-looking woman named Alaxia. Natir\nclapped his slender hands to quiet the crowd, and soon the only sound was\nthat of the soft rain.\n“Brightlord Amaram,” Roshone said, nodding to the lighteyed man in\nthe uniform, “is absendiar highmarshal of our princedom. He is in\ncommand of defending our borders while the king and Brightlord Sadeas\nare away.”\nKaladin nodded. Everyone knew of Amaram. He was far more\nimportant than most military men who passed through Hearthstone.\nAmaram stepped forward to speak.\n“You have a fine town here,” Amaram said to the gathered darkeyes.\nHe had a strong, deep voice. “Thank you for hosting me.”\nKaladin frowned, glancing at the other townspeople. They seemed as\nconfused as he by the statement.\n“Normally,” Amaram said, “I would leave this task to one of my\nsubordinate officers. But as I was visiting with my cousin, I decided to\ncome down in person. It is not so onerous a task that I need delegate it.”\n“Excuse me, Brightlord,” said Callins, one of the farmers. “But what\nduty is that?”\n“Why, recruitment, good farmer,” Amaram said, nodding to Alaxia,\nwho stepped forward with a sheet of paper strapped to a board. “The king\ntook most of our armies with him on his quest to fulfill the Vengeance Pact."

I do this with volunteers whenever\npossible.”\nThe townspeople fell still. Boys talked of running off to the army, but\nfew of them would actually do it. Hearthstone’s duty was to provide food.\n“My fighting is not as glorious as the war for vengeance,” Amaram\nsaid, “but it is our sacred duty to defend our lands. This tour will be for four\nyears, and upon completing your duty, you will receive a war bonus equal\nto one-tenth your total wages. You may then return, or you may sign up\nfor further duty. Distinguish yourself and rise to a high rank, and it could\nmean an increase of one nahn for you and your children. Are there any\nvolunteers?”\n“I’ll go,” Jost said, stepping forward.\n“Me too,” Abry added.\n“Jost!” Jost’s mother said, grabbing his arm. “The crops—”\n“Your crops are important, darkwoman,” Amaram said, “but not nearly\nas important as the defense of our people. The king sends back riches from\nthe plundered Plains, and the gemstones he has captured can provide food\nfor Alethkar in emergency. You two are both welcome. Are there any\nothers?”\nThree more boys from the town stepped forward, and one older man—\nHarl, who had lost his wife to the scarfever. He was the man whose\ndaughter Kaladin hadn’t been able to save after her fall.\n“Excellent,” Amaram said. “Are there any others?”\nThe townspeople were still. Oddly so. Many of the boys Kaladin had\nheard talk so often about joining the army looked away. Kaladin felt his\nheart beating, and his leg twitched, as if itching to propel him forward.\nNo. He was to be a surgeon. Lirin looked at him, and his dark brown\neyes displayed hints of deep concern. But when Kaladin didn’t make any\nmoves forward, he relaxed.\n“Very well,” Amaram said, nodding to Roshone. “We will need your\nlist after all.”\n“List?” Lirin asked loudly.\nAmaram glanced at him. “The need of our army is great, darkborn. I\nwill take volunteers first, but the army must be replenished. As citylord, my\ncousin has the duty and honor of deciding which men to send.”\n“Read the first four names, Alaxia,” Roshone said, “and the last one.”\nAlaxia looked down at her list, speaking with a dry voice. “Agil, son\nof Marf. Caull, son of Taleb.”\nKaladin looked up at Lirin with apprehension.\n“He can’t take you,” Lirin said. “We’re of the second nahn and provide\nan essential function to the town—I as surgeon, you as my only apprentice.\nBy the law, we are exempt from conscription. Roshone knows it.”\n“Habrin, son of Arafik,” Alaxia continued. “Jorna, son of Loats.” She\nhesitated, then looked up. “Tien, son of Lirin.”"

Even the rain seemed to\nhesitate for a moment. Then, all eyes turned toward Tien. The boy looked\ndumbfounded. Lirin was immune as town surgeon, Kaladin immune as his\napprentice.\nBut not Tien. He was a carpenter’s third apprentice, not vital, not\nimmune.\nHesina gripped Tien tightly. “No!”\nLirin stepped in front of them, defensive. Kaladin stood stunned,\nlooking at Roshone. Smiling, self-satisfied Roshone.\nWe took his son, Kaladin realized, meeting those beady eyes. This is\nhis revenge.\n“I…” Tien said. “The military?” For once, he seemed to lose his\nconfidence, his optimism. His eyes opened wide, and he grew very pale. He\nfainted when he saw blood. He hated fighting. He was still small and\nspindly despite his age.\n“He’s too young,” Lirin declared. Their neighbors sidled away, leaving\nLirin’s family to stand alone in the rain.\nAmaram frowned. “In the cities, youths as young as eight and nine are\naccepted into the military.”\n“Lighteyed sons!” Lirin said. “To be trained as officers. They aren’t\nsent into battle!”\nAmaram frowned more deeply. He stepped out into the rain, walking\nup to the family. “How old are you, son?” he asked Tien.\n“He’s thirteen,” Lirin said.\nAmaram glanced at him. “The surgeon. I’ve heard of you.” He sighed,\nglancing back at Amaram. “I haven’t the time to engage in your petty,\nsmall-town politics, cousin. Isn’t there another boy that will do?”\n“It is my choice!” Roshone insisted. “Given me by the dictates of law.\nI send those the town can spare—well, that boy is the first one we can\nspare.”\nLirin stepped forward, eyes full of anger. Highmarshal Amaram caught\nhim by the arm. “Do not do something you would regret, darkborn.\nRoshone has acted according to the law.”\n“You hid behind the law, sneering at me, surgeon,” Roshone called to\nLirin. “Well, now it turns against you. Keep those spheres! The look on\nyour face at this moment is worth the price of every one of them!”\n“I…” Tien said again. Kaladin had never seen the boy so terrified.\nKaladin felt powerless. The crowd’s eyes were on Lirin, standing with\nhis arm in the grip of the lighteyed general, locking his gaze with Roshone.\n“I’ll make the lad a runner boy for a year or two,” Amaram promised.\n“He won’t be in combat. It is the best I can do. Every body is needed in\nthese times.”\nLirin slumped, then bowed his head. Roshone laughed, motioning\nLaral toward the carriage.

They will be\nweighed. Report to the army in two hours and ask for Sergeant Hav.” He\nturned and followed Roshone.\nTien stared after him, pale as a whitewashed building. Kaladin could\nsee his terror at leaving his family. His brother, the one who always made\nhim smile when it rained. It was physically painful for Kaladin to see him\nso scared. It wasn’t right. Tien should smile. That was who he was.\nHe felt the wooden horse in his pocket. Tien always brought him relief\nwhen he felt pained. Suddenly, it occurred to him that there was something\nhe could do in turn. It’s time to stop hiding in the room when someone else\nholds up the globe of light, Kaladin thought. It’s time to be a man.\n“Brightlord Amaram!” Kaladin yelled.\nThe general hesitated, standing on the stepstool into the carriage, one\nfoot in the door. He glanced over his shoulder.\n“I want to take Tien’s place,” Kaladin said.\n“Not allowed!” Roshone said from inside the carriage. “The law says I\nmay choose.”\nAmaram nodded grimly.\n“Then what if you take me as well,” Kaladin said. “Can I volunteer?”\nThat way, at least, Tien wouldn’t be alone.\n“Kaladin!” Hesina said, grabbing him on one arm.\n“It is allowed,” Amaram said. “I will not turn away any soldier, son. If\nyou want to join, you are welcome.”\n“Kaladin, no,” Lirin said. “Don’t both of you go. Don’t—”\nKaladin looked at Tien, the boy’s face wet beneath his wide-brimmed\nhat. He shook his head, but his eyes seemed hopeful.\n“I volunteer,” Kaladin said, turning back to Amaram. “I’ll go.”\n“Then you have two hours,” Amaram said, climbing into the carriage.\n“Same possession allotment as the others.”\nThe carriage door shut, but not before Kaladin got a glimpse of an\neven more satisfied Roshone. Rattling, the vehicle splashed away, dropping\na sheet of water from its roof.\n“Why?” Lirin said, turning back to Kaladin, his voice ragged. “Why\nhave you done this to me? After all of our plans!”\nKaladin turned to Tien. The boy took his arm. “Thank you,” Tien\nwhispered. “Thank you, Kaladin. Thank you.”\n“I’ve lost both of you,” Lirin said hoarsely, splashing away. “Storm it!\nBoth of you.” He was crying. Kaladin’s mother was crying too.

They inched away from him like vertical slugs.\n“In four years, I will bring him home safely,” Kaladin said. “I promise\nit by the storms and the Almighty’s tenth name itself. I will bring him\nback.”\nI promise….\n“Yelignar, called Blightwind, was one that could speak like a man,\nthough often his voice was accompanied by the wails of those he\nconsumed.”\n—The Unmade were obviously fabrications of folklore. Curiously,\nmost were not considered individuals, but instead personifications of\nkinds of destruction. This quote is from Traxil, line 33, considered a\nprimary source, though I doubt its authenticity.\nThey are an oddly welcoming group, these wild parshmen, Shallan read. It\nwas King Gavilar’s account again, recorded a year before his murder. It has\nnow been nearly five months since our first meeting. Dalinar continues to\npressure me to return to our homeland, insisting that the expedition has\nstretched too long.\nThe parshmen promise that they will lead me on a hunt for a great-\nshelled beast they call an ulo mas vara, which my scholars say translates\nroughly to “Monster of the Chasms.” If their descriptions are accurate,\nthese creatures have large gemhearts, and one of their heads would make a\ntruly impressive trophy. They also speak of their terrible gods, and we think\nthey must be referring to several particularly large chasm greatshells.\nWe are amazed to find religion among these parshmen. The mounting\nevidence of a complete parshman society—with civilization, culture, and a\nunique language—is astounding. My stormwardens have begun calling this\npeople “the Parshendi.” It is obvious this group is very different from our\nordinary servant parshmen, and may not even be the same race, despite the\nskin patterns. Perhaps they are distant cousins, as different from ordinary\nparshmen as Alethi axehounds are from the Selay breed.\nThe Parshendi have seen our servants, and are confused by them.\n“Where is their music?” Klade will often ask me. I do not know what he\nmeans. But our servants do not react to the Parshendi at all, showing no\ninterest in emulating them. This is reassuring.\nThe question about music may have to do with the humming and\nchanting the Parshendi often do. They have an uncanny ability to make\nmusic together. I swear that I have left one Parshendi singing to himself,\nthen soon passed another out of earshot of the first, yet singing the very\nsame song—eerily near to the other in tempo, tune, and lyric.\nTheir favored instrument is the drum. They are crudely made, with\nhandprints of paint marking the sides. This matches their simple buildings,\nwhich they construct of crem and stone. They build them in the craterlike\nrock formations here at the edge of the Shattered Plains. I ask Klade if they\nworry about highstorms, but he just laughs. “Why worry? If the buildings\nblow down, we can build them again, can we not?”"

If the buildings\nblow down, we can build them again, can we not?”\nOn the other side of the alcove, Jasnah’s book rustled as she turned a\npage. Shallan set aside her own volume, then picked through the books on\nthe desk. Her philosophy training done for the time being, she had returned\nto her study of King Gavilar’s murder.\nShe slid a small volume out from the bottom of the stack: a record\ndictated by Stormwarden Matain, one of the scholars who had accompanied\nthe king. Shallan flipped through the pages, searching for a specific passage.\nIt was a description of the very first Parshendi hunting party they\nencountered.\nIt happened after we set up beside a deep river in a heavily wooded\narea. It was an ideal location for a long-term camp, as the dense cobwood\ntrees would protect against highstorm winds, and the river’s gorge\neliminated the risk of flooding. His Majesty wisely took my advice, sending\nscouting parties both upriver and down.\nHighprince Dalinar’s scouting party was the first to encounter the\nstrange, untamed parshmen. When he returned to camp with his story, I—\nlike many others—refused to believe his claims. Surely Brightlord Dalinar\nhad simply run across the parshman servants of another expedition like our\nown.\nOnce they visited our camp the next day, their reality could no longer\nbe denied. There were ten of them—parshmen to be sure, but bigger than\nthe familiar ones. Some had skin marbled black and red, and others were\nmarbled white and red, as is more common in Alethkar. They carried\nmagnificent weapons, the bright steel etched with complex decorations, but\nwore simple clothing of woven narbin cloth.\nBefore long, His Majesty became fascinated by these strange\nparshmen, insisting that I begin a study of their language and society. I’ll\nadmit that my original intent was to expose them as a hoax of some kind.\nThe more we learned, however, the more I came to realize how faulty my\noriginal assessment had been.\nShallan tapped the page, thinking. Then she pulled out a thick volume,\ntitled King Gavilar Kholin, a Biography, published by Gavilar’s widow,\nNavani, two years before. Shallan flipped through pages, scanning for a\nparticular paragraph.\nMy husband was an excellent king—an inspiring leader, an\nunparalleled duelist, and a genius of battlefield tactics. But he didn’t have a\nsingle scholarly finger on his left hand. He never showed an interest in the\naccounting of highstorms, was bored by talk of science, and ignored\nfabrials unless they had an obvious use in battle. He was a man built after\nthe classical masculine ideal.\n“Why was he so interested in them?” Shallan said out loud.\n“Hmmm?” Jasnah asked.\n“King Gavilar,” Shallan said. “Your mother insists in her biography\nthat he wasn’t a scholar.”\n“True.”\n“But he was interested in the Parshendi,” Shallan said. “Even before he\ncould have known about their Shardblades.

Was\nthat just embellishment, to make him sound more scholarly to future\nreaders?”\n“No,” Jasnah said, lowering her own book. “The longer he remained in\nthe Unclaimed Hills, the more fascinated by the Parshendi he became.”\n“So there’s a discrepancy. Why would a man with no prior interest in\nscholarship suddenly become so obsessed?”\n“Yes,” Jasnah said. “I too have wondered about this. But sometimes,\npeople change. When he returned, I was encouraged by his interest; we\nspent many evenings talking about his discoveries. It was one of the few\ntimes when I felt I really connected with my father.”\nShallan bit her lip. “Jasnah,” she finally asked. “Why did you assign\nme to research this event? You lived through this; you already know\neverything I’m ‘discovering.’”\n“I feel a fresh perspective may be of value.” Jasnah put down her\nbook, looking over at Shallan. “I don’t intend for you to find specific\nanswers. Instead, I hope that you will notice details I’ve missed. You are\ncoming to see how my father’s personality changed during those months,\nand that means you are digging deeply. Believe it or not, few others have\ncaught the discrepancy you just did—though many do note his later\nchanges, once he returned to Kholinar.”\n“Even so, I feel a little odd studying it. Perhaps I’m still influenced by\nmy tutors’ idea that only the classics are a proper realm of study for young\nladies.”\n“The classics do have their place, and I will send you to classical\nworks on occasion, as I did with your study of morality. But I intend such\ntangents to be adjuncts to your current projects. Those must be the focus,\nnot long-lost historical conundrums.”\nShallan nodded. “But Jasnah, aren’t you a historian? Aren’t those\nlong-lost historical conundrums the meat of your field?”\n“I’m a Veristitalian,” Jasnah said. “We search for answers in the past,\nreconstructing what truly happened. To many, writing a history is not about\ntruth, but about presenting the most flattering picture of themselves and\ntheir motives. My sisters and I choose projects that we feel were\nmisunderstood or misrepresented, and in studying them hope to better\nunderstand the present.”\nWhy, then, are you spending so much time studying folktales and\nlooking for evil spirits? No, Jasnah was searching for something real.\nSomething so important that it drew her away from the Shattered Plains and\nthe fight to avenge her father. She intended to do something with those\nfolktales, and Shallan’s research was part of it, somehow.\nThat excited her. It was the sort of thing she’d wanted since she’d been\na child, looking through her father’s few books, frustrated that he’d chased\noff yet another tutor. Here, with Jasnah, Shallan was part of something—\nand, knowing Jasnah, it was something big.\nAnd yet, she thought. Tozbek’s ship arrives tomorrow morning.

I need to—\n“What is Urithiru?” Shallan found herself asking instead.\nTo her surprise, Jasnah answered without hesitation. “Urithiru was said\nto be the center of the Silver Kingdoms, a city that held ten thrones, one for\neach king. It was the most majestic, most amazing, most important city in\nall the world.”\n“Really? Why hadn’t I heard of it before?”\n“Because it was abandoned even before the Lost Radiants turned\nagainst mankind. Most scholars consider it just a myth. The ardents refuse\nto speak of it, due to its association with the Radiants, and therefore with\nthe first major failure of Vorinism. Much of what we know about the city\ncomes from fragments of lost works quoted by classical scholars. Many of\nthose classical works have, themselves, survived only in pieces. Indeed, the\nsingle complete work we have from early years is The Way of Kings, and\nthat is only because of the Vanrial’s efforts.”\nShallan nodded slowly. “If there were ruins of a magnificent, ancient\ncity hidden somewhere, Natanatan—unexplored, overgrown, wild—would\nbe the natural place to find them.”\n“Urithiru is not in Natanatan,” Jasnah said, smiling. “But it is a good\nguess, Shallan. Return to your studies.”\n“The weapons,” Shallan said.\nJasnah raised an eyebrow.\n“The Parshendi. They carried beautiful weapons of fine, etched steel.\nYet they used skin drums with crude handprints on the sides and lived in\nhuts of stone and crem. Doesn’t that strike you as incongruous?”\n“Yes. I would certainly describe that as an oddity.”\n“Then—”\n“I assure you, Shallan,” Jasnah said. “The city is not there.”\n“But you are interested in the Shattered Plains. You spoke of them\nwith Brightlord Dalinar through the spanreed.”\n“I did.”\n“What were the Voidbringers?” Now that Jasnah was actually\nanswering, perhaps she’d say. “What were they really?”\nJasnah studied her with a curious expression. “Nobody knows for sure.\nMost scholars consider them, like Urithiru, mere myths, while theologians\naccept them as counterparts of the Almighty—monsters that dwelled in the\nhearts of men, much as the Almighty once lived there.”\n“But—”\n“Return to your studies, child,” Jasnah said, raising her book. “Perhaps\nwe will speak of this another time.”\nThere was an air of finality about that. Shallan bit her lip, keeping\nherself from saying something rude just to draw Jasnah back into\nconversation. She doesn’t trust me, she thought. Perhaps with good reason.\nYou’re leaving, Shallan told herself again. Tomorrow. You’re sailing away\nfrom this.\nBut that meant she had only one day left. One more day in the grand\nPalanaeum.

And\nduring that time, she’d see what she could discover about the Voidbringers\non her own.\nTwo hours later, Shallan sat at a cluttered desk at the back of one of the\nPalanaeum’s lower-level rooms, her sphere lantern illuminating a stack of\nhastily gathered volumes, none of which had proven much use.\nIt seemed that everybody knew something about the Voidbringers.\nPeople in rural areas spoke of them as mysterious creatures that came out at\nnight, stealing from the unlucky and punishing the foolish. Those\nVoidbringers seemed more mischievous than evil. But then there would be\nthe odd story about a Voidbringer taking on the form of a wayward traveler\nwho—after receiving kindness from a tallew farmer—would slaughter the\nentire family, drink their blood, then write voidish symbols across the walls\nin black ash.\nMost people in the cities, however, saw the Voidbringers as spirits who\nstalked at night, a kind of evil spren that invaded the hearts of men and\nmade them do terrible things. When a good man grew angry, it was the\nwork of a Voidbringer.\nScholars laughed at all these ideas. Actual historical accounts—the\nones she could find quickly—were contradictory. Were the Voidbringers the\ndenizens of Damnation? If so, wouldn’t Damnation now be empty, as the\nVoidbringers had conquered the Tranquiline Halls and cast out mankind to\nRoshar?\nI should have known that I’d have trouble finding anything solid,\nShallan thought, leaning back in her chair. Jasnah’s been researching this\nfor months, maybe years. What did I expect to find in a few hours?\nThe only thing the research had done was increase her confusion. What\nerrant winds had brought Jasnah to this topic? It made no sense. Studying\nthe Voidbringers was like trying to determine if deathspren were real or not.\nWhat was the point?\nShe shook her head, stacking her books. The ardents would reshelve\nthem for her. She needed to fetch Tifandor’s biography and return to their\nbalcony. She rose and walked toward the room’s exit, carrying her lantern\nin her freehand. She hadn’t brought a parshman; she intended to carry back\nonly the one book. As she reached the exit, she noticed another light\napproaching out on the balcony. Just before she arrived, someone stepped\nup to the doorway, holding aloft a garnet lantern.\n“Kabsal?” Shallan asked, surprised to see his youthful face, painted\nblue by the light."

Jasnah said you were looking for\nTifandor.”\n“I…got turned around.”\nHe raised an eyebrow at her.\n“Bad lie?” she asked.\n“Terrible,” he said. “You’re two floors up and about a thousand index\nnumbers off. After I couldn’t find you below, I asked the lift porters to take\nme where they brought you, and they took me here.”\n“Jasnah’s training can be exhausting,” Shallan said. “So I sometimes\nfind a quiet corner to relax and compose myself. It’s the only time I get to\nbe alone.”\nKabsal nodded thoughtfully.\n“Better?” she asked.\n“Still problematic. You took a break, but for two hours? Besides, I\nremember you telling me that Jasnah’s training wasn’t so terrible.”\n“She’d believe me,” Shallan said. “She thinks she’s far more\ndemanding than she is. Or…well, she is demanding. I just don’t mind as\nmuch as she thinks I do.”\n“Very well,” he said. “But what were you doing down here, then?”\nShe bit her lip, causing him to laugh.\n“What?” she demanded, blushing.\n“You just look so blasted innocent when you do that!”\n“I am innocent.”\n“Didn’t you just lie to me twice in a row?”\n“Innocent, as in the opposite of sophisticated.” She grimaced.\n“Otherwise, they’d have been more convincing lies. Come. Walk with me\nwhile I fetch Tifandor. If we hurry, I won’t have to lie to Jasnah.”\n“Fair enough,” he said, joining her and strolling around the perimeter\nof the Palanaeum. The hollow inverted pyramid rose toward the ceiling far\nabove, the four walls expanding outward at a slant. The topmost levels were\nbrighter and easier to make out, tiny lights bobbing along railings in the\nhands of ardents or scholars.\n“Fifty-seven levels,” Shallan said. “I can’t even imagine how much\nwork it must have been for you to create all this.”\n“We didn’t create it,” Kabsal said. “It was here. The main shaft, at\nleast. The Kharbranthians cut out the rooms for the books.”\n“This formation is natural?”\n“As natural as cities like Kholinar. Or have you forgotten my\ndemonstration?”\n“No. But why didn’t you use this place as one of your examples?”\n“We haven’t found the right sand pattern yet,” he said. “But we’re sure\nthe Almighty himself made this place, as he did the cities.”\n“What about the Dawnsingers?” Shallan asked.\n“What about them?”\n“Could they have created it?”\nHe chuckled as they arrived at the lift. “That isn’t the kind of thing the\nDawnsingers did. They were healers, kindly spren sent by the Almighty to\ncare for humans once we were forced out of the Tranquiline Halls.”\n“Kind of like the opposite of the Voidbringers.”\n“I suppose you could say that."

They\nbegan lowering the platform, the pulleys squeaking and wood shaking\nbeneath her feet.\n“If you think to distract me with this conversation,” Kabsal noted,\nfolding his arms and leaning back against the railing, “you won’t be\nsuccessful. I sat up there with your disapproving mistress for well over an\nhour, and let me say that it was not a pleasant experience. I think she knows\nI still intend to try and convert her.”\n“Of course she does. She’s Jasnah. She knows practically everything.”\n“Except whatever it is she came here to study.”\n“The Voidbringers,” Shallan said. “That’s what she’s studying.”\nHe frowned. A few moments later, the lift came to a rest on the\nappropriate floor. “The Voidbringers?” he said, sounding curious. She’d\nhave expected him to be scornful or amused. No, she thought. He’s an\nardent. He believes in them.\n“What were they?” she asked, walking out. Not far below, the massive\ncavern came to a point. There was a large infused diamond there, marking\nthe nadir.\n“We don’t like to talk about it,” Kabsal said as he joined her.\n“Why not? You’re an ardent. This is part of your religion.”\n“An unpopular part. People prefer to hear about the Ten Divine\nAttributes or the Ten Human Failings. We accommodate them because we,\nalso, prefer that to the deep past.”\n“Because…” she prodded.\n“Because,” he said with a sigh, “of our failure. Shallan, the devotaries\n—at their core—are still classical Vorinism. That means the Hierocracy and\nthe fall of the Lost Radiants are our shame.” He held up his deep blue\nlantern. Shallan strolled at his side, curious, letting him just talk.\n“We believe that the Voidbringers were real, Shallan. A scourge and a\nplague. A hundred times they came upon mankind. First casting us from the\nTranquiline Halls, then trying to destroy us here on Roshar. They weren’t\njust spren that hid under rocks, then came out to steal someone’s laundry.\nThey were creatures of terrible destructive power, forged in Damnation,\ncreated from hate.”\n“By whom?” Shallan asked.\n“What?”\n“Who made them? I mean, the Almighty wasn’t likely to have ‘created\nsomething from hate.’ So what made them?”\n“Everything has its opposite, Shallan. The Almighty is a force of good.\nTo balance his goodness, the cosmere needed the Voidbringers as his\nopposite.”\n“So the more good that the Almighty did, the more evil he created as a\nby-product? What’s the point of doing any good at all if it just creates more\nevil?”\n“I see Jasnah has continued your training in philosophy.”\n“That’s not philosophy,” Shallan said. “That’s simple logic.”\nHe sighed. “I don’t think you want to get into the deep theology of\nthis.

Suffice it to say that the Almighty’s pure goodness created the\nVoidbringers, but men may choose good without creating evil because as\nmortals they have a dual nature. Thus the only way for good to increase in\nthe cosmere is for men to create it—in that way, good may come to\noutweigh evil.”\n“All right,” she said. “But I don’t buy the explanation about the\nVoidbringers.”\n“I thought you were a believer.”\n“I am. But just because I honor the Almighty doesn’t mean I’m going\nto accept any explanation, Kabsal. It might be religion, but it still has to\nmake sense.”\n“Didn’t you once tell me that you didn’t understand your own self?”\n“Well, yes.”\n“And yet you expect to be able to understand the exact workings of the\nAlmighty?”\nShe drew her lips into a line. “All right, fine. But I still want to know\nmore about the Voidbringers.”\nHe shrugged as she guided him into an archive room, filled with\nshelves of books. “I told you the basics, Shallan. The Voidbringers were an\nembodiment of evil. We fought them off ninety and nine times, led by the\nHeralds and their chosen knights, the ten orders we call the Knights\nRadiant. Finally, Aharietiam came, the Last Desolation. The Voidbringers\nwere cast back into the Tranquiline Halls. The Heralds followed to force\nthem out of heaven as well, and Roshar’s Heraldic Epochs ended. Mankind\nentered the Era of Solitude. The modern era.”\n“But why is everything from before so fragmented?”\n“This was thousands and thousands of years ago, Shallan,” Kabsal\nsaid. “Before history, before men even knew how to forge steel. We had to\nbe given Shardblades, otherwise we would have had to fight the\nVoidbringers with clubs.”\n“And yet we had the Silver Kingdoms and the Knights Radiant.”\n“Formed and led by the Heralds.”\nShallan frowned, counting off rows of shelves. She stopped at the\ncorrect one, handed her lantern to Kabsal, then walked down the aisle and\nplucked the biography off the shelf. Kabsal followed her, holding up the\nlanterns.\n“There’s more to this,” Shallan said. “Otherwise, Jasnah wouldn’t be\ndigging so hard.”\n“I can tell you why she’s doing it,” he said.\nShallan glanced at him.\n“Don’t you see?” he said. “She’s trying to prove that the Voidbringers\nweren’t real. She wants to demonstrate that this was all a fabrication of the\nRadiants.” He stepped forward and turned to face her, the lanternlight\nrebounding from the books to either side, making his face pale. “She wants\nto prove once and for all that the devotaries—and Vorinism—are a gigantic\nfraud. That’s what this is all about.”\n“Maybe,” Shallan said thoughtfully. It did seem to fit. What better goal\nfor an avowed heretic? Undermining foolish beliefs and disproving\nreligion?

It explained why Jasnah would study something as seemingly\ninconsequential as the Voidbringers. Find the right evidence in the historical\nrecords, and Jasnah might well be able to prove herself right.\n“Haven’t we been scourged enough?” Kabsal said, eyes angry. “The\nardents are no threat to her. We’re not a threat to anyone these days. We\ncan’t own property…Damnation, we’re property ourselves. We dance to the\nwhims of the citylords and warlords, afraid to tell them the truths of their\nsins for fear of retribution. We’re whitespines without tusks or claws,\nexpected to sit at our master’s feet and offer praise. Yet this is real. It’s all\nreal, and they ignore us and—”\nHe cut off suddenly, glancing at her, lips tight, jaw clenched. She’d\nnever seen such fervor, such fury from the pleasant ardent. She wouldn’t\nhave thought him capable of it.\n“I’m sorry,” he said, turning from her, leading the way back down the\naisle.\n“It’s all right,” she said, hurrying after him, suddenly feeling\ndepressed. Shallan had expected to find something grander, something more\nmysterious, behind Jasnah’s secretive research. Could it all really just be\nabout proving Vorinism false?\nThey walked in silence out to the balcony. And there, she realized she\nhad to tell him. “Kabsal, I’m leaving.”\nHe looked at her, surprised.\n“I’ve had news from my family,” she said. “I can’t speak of it, but I\ncan stay no longer.”\n“Something about your father?”\n“Why? Have you heard something?”\n“Only that he’s been reclusive lately. More than normal.”\nShe suppressed a flinch. News had gotten this far? “I’m sorry to go so\nsuddenly.”\n“You’ll return?”\n“I don’t know.”\nHe looked into her eyes, searching. “Do you know when you’ll be\nleaving?” he said in a suddenly cool voice.\n“Tomorrow morning.”\n“Well then,” he said. “Will you at least do me the honor of sketching\nme? You’ve never given me a likeness, though you’ve done many of the\nother ardents.”\nShe started, realizing that was true. Despite their time together, she’d\nnever done a sketch of Kabsal. She raised her freehand to her mouth. “I’m\nsorry!”\nHe seemed taken aback. “I didn’t mean it bitterly, Shallan. It’s really\nnot that important—”\n“Yes it is,” she said, grabbing his hand, towing him along the walkway.\n“I left my drawing things up above. Come on.” She hurried him to the lift,\ninstructing the parshmen to carry them up. As the lift began to rise, Kabsal\nlooked at her hand in his. She dropped it hastily.\n“You’re a very confusing woman,” he said stiffly.\n“I warned you.” She held the retrieved book close to her breast. “I\nbelieve you said you had me figured out.”\n“I rescind that statement.” He looked at her. “You’re really leaving?”"

Kabsal…I’m not what you think I am.”\n“I think you’re a beautiful, intelligent woman.”\n“Well, you have the woman part right.”\n“Your father is sick, isn’t he?”\nShe didn’t answer.\n“I can see why you’d want to return to be with him,” Kabsal said. “But\nsurely you won’t abandon your wardship forever. You’ll be back with\nJasnah.”\n“And she won’t be staying in Kharbranth forever. She’s been moving\nfrom place to place almost constantly for the last two years.”\nHe looked ahead, staring out the front of the lift as they rose. Soon,\nthey had to transfer to another lift to carry them up the next group of floors.\n“I shouldn’t have been spending time with you,” he finally said. “The senior\nardents think I’m too distracted. They never like it when one of us starts\nlooking outside the ardentia.”\n“Your right to court is protected.”\n“We’re property. A man’s rights can be protected at the same time that\nhe is discouraged from exercising them. I’ve avoided work, I’ve disobeyed\nmy superiors…In courting you, I’ve also courted trouble.”\n“I didn’t ask you for any of that.”\n“You didn’t discourage me.”\nShe had no response for that, other than to feel a rising worry. A hint of\npanic, a desire to run away and hide. During her years of near-solitude on\nher father’s estate, she had never dreamed of a relationship like this one. Is\nthat what this is? she thought, panic swelling. A relationship? Her\nintentions in coming to Kharbranth had seemed so straightforward. How\nhad she gotten to the point where she risked breaking a man’s heart?\nAnd, to her shame, she admitted to herself that she would miss the\nresearch more than Kabsal. Was she a horrible person for feeling that way?\nShe was fond of him. He was pleasant. Interesting.\nHe looked at her, and there was longing in his eyes. He seemed…\nStormfather, he seemed to really be in love with her. Shouldn’t she be\nfalling in love with him too? She didn’t think she was. She was just\nconfused.\nWhen they reached the top of the Palanaeum’s system of lifts, she\npractically ran out into the Veil. Kabsal followed, but they needed another\nlift up to Jasnah’s alcove, and soon she found herself trapped with him once\nmore.\n“I could come,” Kabsal said softly. “Return with you to Jah Keved.”\nShallan’s panic increased. She barely knew him. Yes, they had chatted\nfrequently, but rarely about the important things. If he left the ardentia, he’d\nbe demoted to tenth dahn, almost as low as a darkeyes. He’d be without\nmoney or house, in almost as bad a position as her family.\nHer family. What would her brothers say if she brought a virtual\nstranger back with her? Another man to become part of their problems,\nprivy to their secrets?"

Another man to become part of their problems,\nprivy to their secrets?\n“I can see from your expression that it’s not an option,” Kabsal said.\n“It seems that I’ve misinterpreted some very important things.”\n“No, it’s not that,” Shallan said quickly. “It’s just…Oh, Kabsal. How\ncan you expect to make sense of my actions when even I can’t make sense\nof them?” She touched his arm, turning him toward her. “I have been\ndishonest with you. And with Jasnah. And, most infuriatingly, with myself.\nI’m sorry.”\nHe shrugged, obviously trying to feign nonchalance. “At least I’ll get a\nsketch. Won’t I?”\nShe nodded as the lift finally shuddered to a halt. She walked down the\ndark hallway, Kabsal following with the lanterns. Jasnah looked up\nappraisingly as Shallan entered their alcove, but did not ask why she’d\ntaken so long. Shallan found herself blushing as she gathered her drawing\ntools. Kabsal hesitated in the doorway. He’d left a basket of bread and jam\non the desk. The top of it was still wrapped with a cloth; Jasnah hadn’t\ntouched it, though he always offered her some as a peace offering. Without\njam, since Jasnah hated it.\n“Where should I sit?” Kabsal asked.\n“Just stand there,” Shallan said, sitting down, propping her sketchpad\nagainst her legs and holding it still with her covered safehand. She looked\nup at him, leaning with one hand against the doorframe. Head shaved, light\ngrey robe draped around him, sleeves short, waist tied with a white sash.\nEyes confused. She blinked, taking a Memory, then began to sketch.\nIt was one of the most awkward experiences of her life. She didn’t tell\nKabsal that he could move, and so he held the pose. He didn’t speak.\nPerhaps he thought it would spoil the picture. Shallan found her hand\nshaking as she sketched, though—thankfully—she managed to hold back\ntears.\nTears, she thought, doing the final lines of the wall around Kabsal.\nWhy should I cry? I’m not the one who just got rejected. Can’t my emotions\nmake sense once in a while?\n“Here,” she said, pulling the page free and holding it up. “It will\nsmudge unless you spray it with lacquer.”\nKabsal hesitated, then walked over, taking the picture in reverent\nfingers. “It’s wonderful,” he whispered. He looked up, then hurried to his\nlantern, opening it and pulling out the garnet broam inside. “Here,” he said,\nproffering it. “Payment.”\n“I can’t take that! For one thing, it’s not yours.” As an ardent, anything\nKabsal carried would belong to the king.\n“Please,” Kabsal said. “I want to give you something.”\n“The picture is a gift,” she said. “If you pay me for it, then I haven’t\ngiven you anything.”\n“Then I’ll commission another,” he said, pressing the glowing sphere"

One of the two of us together.”\nShe paused. She rarely did sketches of herself. They felt strange to\ndraw. “All right.” She took the sphere, then furtively tucked it into her\nsafepouch, beside her Soulcaster. It was a little odd to carry something so\nheavy there, but she’d gotten accustomed to the bulge and weight.\n“Jasnah, do you have a mirror?” she asked.\nThe other woman sighed audibly, obviously annoyed by the\ndistraction. She felt through her things, taking out a mirror. Kabsal fetched\nit.\n“Hold it up beside your head,” Shallan said, “so I can see myself.”\nHe walked back over, doing so, looking confused.\n“Angle it to the side a little,” Shallan said, “all right, there.” She\nblinked, freezing in her mind the image of her face beside his. “Have a seat.\nYou don’t need the mirror any longer. I just wanted it for reference—it\nhelps me for some reason to place my features into the scene I want to\nsketch. I’ll put myself sitting beside you.”\nHe sat on the floor, and Shallan began to work, using it to distract\nherself from her conflicting emotions. Guilt at not feeling as strongly for\nKabsal as he did for her, yet sorrow that she wouldn’t be seeing him\nanymore. And above it all, anxiety about the Soulcaster.\nSketching herself in beside him was challenging. She worked\nfuriously, blending the reality of Kabsal sitting and a fiction of herself, in\nher flower-embroidered dress, sitting with her legs to the side. The face in\nthe mirror became her reference point, and she built her head around it. Too\nnarrow to be beautiful, with hair too light, cheeks dotted with freckles.\nThe Soulcaster, she thought. Being here in Kharbranth with it is a\ndanger. But leaving is dangerous too. Could there be a third option? What if\nI sent it away?\nShe hesitated, charcoal pencil hovering above the picture. Dared she\nsend the fabrial—packaged, delivered to Tozbek in secret—back to Jah\nKeved without her? She wouldn’t have to worry about being incriminated if\nher room or person were searched, though she’d want to destroy all pictures\nshe’d drawn of Jasnah with the Soulcaster. And she wouldn’t risk suspicion\nby vanishing when Jasnah discovered her Soulcaster didn’t work.\nShe continued her drawing, increasingly withdrawn into her thoughts,\nletting her fingers work. If she sent the Soulcaster back alone, then she\ncould stay in Kharbranth. It was a golden, tempting prospect, but one that\nthrew her emotions further into a jumbled mess. She’d been preparing\nherself to leave for so long. What would she do about Kabsal? And Jasnah.\nCould Shallan really remain here, accepting Jasnah’s freely given tutelage,\nafter what she’d done?\nYes, Shallan thought. Yes, I could."

She would live with the\nguilt, day by day, if it meant continuing to learn. It was terribly selfish of\nher, and she was ashamed of it. But she would do it for a little longer, at\nleast. She’d have to go back eventually, of course. She couldn’t leave her\nbrothers to face danger alone. They needed her.\nSelfishness, followed by courage. She was nearly as surprised by the\nlatter as she had been by the former. Neither was something she often\nassociated with who she was. But she was coming to realize that she hadn’t\nknown who she was. Not until she left Jah Keved and everything familiar,\neverything she’d been expected to be.\nHer sketching grew more and more fervent. She finished the figures\nand moved to the background. Quick, bold lines became the floor and the\narchway behind. A scribbled dark smudge for the side of the desk, casting a\nshadow. Crisp, thin lines for the lantern sitting on the floor. Sweeping,\nbreezelike lines to form the legs and robes of the creature standing behind\n—\nShallan froze, fingers drawing an unintended line of charcoal, breaking\naway from the figure she’d sketched directly behind Kabsal. A figure that\nwasn’t really there, a figure with a sharp, angular symbol hovering above its\ncollar instead of a head.\nShallan stood, throwing back her chair, sketchpad and charcoal pencil\nclutched in the fingers of her freehand.\n“Shallan?” Kabsal said, standing.\nShe’d done it again. Why? The peace she’d begun to feel during the\nsketching evaporated in a heartbeat, and her heart started to race. The\npressures returned. Kabsal. Jasnah. Her brothers. Decisions, choices,\nproblems.\n“Is everything all right?” Kabsal said, taking a step toward her.\n“I’m sorry,” she said. “I—I made a mistake.”\nHe frowned. To the side, Jasnah looked up, brow wrinkled.\n“It’s all right,” Kabsal said. “Look, let’s have some bread and jam. We\ncan calm down, then you could finish it. I don’t care about a—”\n“I need to go,” Shallan cut in, feeling suffocated. “I’m sorry.”\nShe brushed past the dumbfounded ardent, hurrying from the alcove,\ngiving a wide berth to the place where the figure stood in her sketch. What\nwas wrong with her?\nShe rushed to the lift, calling for the parshmen to lower her. She\nglanced over her shoulder. Kabsal stood in the hallway, looking after her.\nShallan reached the lift, drawing pad clutched in her hand, her heart racing.\nCalm yourself, she thought, leaning back against the lift platform’s wooden\nrailing as the parshmen began to take her down. She looked up at the empty\nlanding above her.\nAnd found herself blinking, memorizing that scene. She began\nsketching again.\nShe drew with concise motions, sketchpad held against her safearm."

She moved without thought, just drawing, staring\nupward.\nShe looked down at what she had drawn. Two figures stood on the\nlanding above, wearing the too-straight robes, like cloth made from metal.\nThey leaned down, watching her go.\nShe looked up again. The landing was empty. What’s happening to me?\nshe thought with increasing horror. When the lift hit the ground, she\nscrambled away, her skirt fluttering. She all but ran to the exit of the Veil,\nhesitating beside the doorway, ignoring the master-servants and ardents who\ngave her confused looks.\nWhere to go? Sweat trickled down the sides of her face. Where to run\nwhen you were going mad?\nShe cut into the main cavern’s crowd. It was late afternoon, and the\ndinner rush had begun—servants pushing dining carts, lighteyes strolling to\ntheir rooms, scholars walking with hands behind their backs. Shallan\ndashed through their midst, her hair coming free of its bun, the hairspike\ndropping to the rock behind her with a high-pitched clink. Her loose red\nhair streamed behind. She reached the hallway leading to their rooms,\npanting, hair askew, and glanced over her shoulder. Amid the flow of traffic\nshe’d left a trail of people looking after her in confusion.\nAlmost against her will, she blinked and took a Memory. She raised\nher pad again, gripping her charcoal pencil in slick fingers, quickly\nsketching the crowded cavern scene. Just faint impressions. Men of lines,\nwomen of curves, walls of sloping rock, carpeted floor, bursts of light in\nsphere lanterns on the walls.\nAnd five symbol-headed figures in black, too-stiff robes and cloaks.\nEach had a different symbol, twisted and unfamiliar to her, hanging above a\nneckless torso. The creatures wove through the crowd unseen. Like\npredators. Focused on Shallan.\nI’m just imagining it, she tried to tell herself. I’m overtaxed, too many\nthings weighing on me. Did they represent her guilt? The stress of betraying\nJasnah and lying to Kabsal? The things she had done before leaving Jah\nKeved?\nShe tried to stand there, waiting, but her fingers refused to remain still.\nShe blinked, then started drawing again on a new sheet. She finished with a\nshaking hand. The figures were almost to her, angular not-heads hanging\nhorrifically where faces should have been.\nLogic warned that she was overreacting, but no matter what she told\nherself, she couldn’t believe it. These were real. And they were coming for\nher.\nShe dashed away, surprising several servants who had been\napproaching her to offer assistance. She ran, slippered feet sliding on the\nhallway carpets, eventually reaching the door to Jasnah’s rooms. Sketchpad\nunder her arm, she unlocked it with quivering fingers, then pushed through\nand slammed it behind her. She locked it again and ran for her chamber.

The only light in\nthe room came from the three diamond marks in the large crystal goblet on\nher nightstand.\nShe got on the bed, then scrambled back as far from the door as she\ncould, until she was against the wall, breathing through her nose with\nfrantic breaths. She still had her sketchpad under her arm, though she’d lost\nthe charcoal. There was more in her nightstand.\nDon’t do it, she thought. Just sit and calm yourself.\nShe felt a growing chill, a rising terror. She had to know. She\nscrambled to pull out the charcoal, then blinked and began to sketch her\nroom.\nCeiling first. Four straight lines. Down the walls. Lines at the corners.\nHer fingers kept moving, drawing, depicting the pad itself, held before her,\nsafehand shrouded and bracing the pad from behind. And then on. To the\nbeings standing around her—twisted symbols unconnected to their uneven\nshoulders. Those not-heads had unreal angles, surfaces that melded in\nweird, impossible ways.\nThe creature at the front was reaching too-smooth fingers toward\nShallan. Just inches from the right side of the sketchpad.\nOh, Stormfather… Shallan thought, charcoal pencil falling still. The\nroom was empty, yet depicted right in front of her was an image of it\ncrowded full of sleek figures. They were close enough that she should be\nable to feel them breathing, if they breathed.\nWas there a chill in the room? Hesitantly—terrified but unable to stop\nherself—Shallan dropped her pencil and raised her freehand to the right.\nAnd felt something.\nShe screamed then, jumping to her feet on her bed, dropping the pad,\nbacking against the wall. Before she could consciously think of what she\nwas doing, she was struggling with her sleeve, trying to get the Soulcaster\nout. It was the only thing she had resembling a weapon. No, that was stupid.\nShe didn’t know how to use it. She was helpless.\nExcept…\nStorms! she thought, frantic. I can’t use that. I promised myself.\nShe began the process anyway. Ten heartbeats, to bring forth the fruit\nof her sin, the proceeds of her most horrific act. She was interrupted\nmidway through by a voice, uncanny yet distinct:\nWhat are you?\nShe clutched her hand to her chest, losing her balance on the soft bed,\nfalling to her knees on the rumpled blanket. She put one hand to the side,\nsteadying herself on the nightstand, fingers brushing the large glass goblet\nthat sat there.\n“What am I?” she whispered. “I’m terrified.”\nThis is true.\nThe bedroom transformed around her.\nThe bed, the nightstand, her sketchpad, the walls, the ceiling—\neverything seemed to pop, forming into tiny, dark glass spheres. She found\nherself in a place with a black sky and a strange, small white sun that hung\non the horizon, too far away.\nShallan screamed as she found herself in midair, falling backward in a\nshower of beads.

Like the tips of candles floating in the air and moving in the\nwind.\nShe hit something. An endless dark sea, except it wasn’t wet. It was\nmade of the small beads, an entire ocean of tiny glass spheres. They surged\naround her, moving in an undulating swell. She gasped, flailing, trying to\nstay afloat.\nYou want me to change? a warm voice said in her mind, distinct and\ndifferent from the cold whisper she had heard earlier. It was deep and\nhollow and conveyed a sense of great age. It seemed to come from her\nhand, and she realized she was grasping something there. One of the beads.\nThe movement of the ocean of glass threatened to tow her down; she\nkicked frantically, somehow managing to stay afloat.\nI’ve been as I am for a great long time, the warm voice said. I sleep so\nmuch. I will change. Give me what you have.\n“I don’t know what you mean! Please, help me!”\nI will change.\nShe felt suddenly cold, as if the warmth were being drawn from her.\nShe screamed as the bead in her fingers flared to sudden warmth. She\ndropped it just as a shift in the ocean swell towed her under, beads rolling\nover one another with a soft clatter.\nShe fell back and hit her bed, back in her room. Beside her, the goblet\non her nightstand melted, the glass becoming red liquid, dropping the three\nspheres inside to the nightstand’s flooded top. The red liquid poured over\nthe sides of the nightstand, splashing to the floor. Shallan pulled back,\nhorrified.\nThe goblet had been changed into blood.\nHer shocked motion thumped the nightstand, shaking it. An empty\nglass water pitcher had been sitting beside the goblet. Her motion knocked\nit over, toppling it to the ground. It shattered on the stone floor, splashing\nthe blood.\nThat was a Soulcasting! she thought. She’d changed the goblet into\nblood, which was one of the Ten Essences. She raised her hand to her head,\nstaring at the red liquid expanding in a pool on her floor. There seemed to\nbe quite a lot of it.\nShe was so bewildered. The voice, the creatures, the sea of glass beads\nand the dark, cold sky. It had all come upon her so quickly.\nI Soulcast, she realized again. I did it!\nDid it have something to do with the creatures? But she’d begun\nseeing them in her drawings before she’d ever stolen the Soulcaster. How…\nwhat…? She looked down at her safehand and the Soulcaster hidden in the\npouch inside her sleeve.\nI didn’t put it on, she thought. Yet I used it anyway.\n“Shallan?”\nIt was Jasnah’s voice. Just outside Shallan’s room. The princess must\nhave followed her. Shallan felt a spike of terror as she saw a line of blood\nleaking toward the doorway. It was almost there, and would pass\nunderneath in a heartbeat.\nWhy did it have to be blood? Nauseated, she leaped to her feet,"

Nauseated, she leaped to her feet,\nslippers soaking up the red liquid.\n“Shallan?” Jasnah said, voice closer. “What was that sound?”\nShallan looked frantically at the blood, then at the sketchpad, filled\nwith pictures of the strange creatures. What if they did have something to\ndo with the Soulcasting? Jasnah would recognize them. There was a shadow\nunder the door.\nShe panicked, tucking the sketchpad away in her trunk. But the blood,\nit would condemn her. There was enough that only a life-threatening wound\ncould have created it. Jasnah would see. She’d know. Blood where there\nshould be none? One of the Ten Essences?\nJasnah was going to know what Shallan had done!\nA thought struck Shallan. It wasn’t a brilliant thought, but it was a way\nout, and it was the only thing that occurred to her. She went to her knees\nand grabbed a shard of the broken glass pitcher in her safehand, through the\nfabric of her sleeve. She took a breath and pulled up her right sleeve, then\nused the glass to cut a shallow gash in her skin. In the panic of the moment,\nit barely even hurt. Blood welled out.\nAs the doorknob turned and the door opened, Shallan dropped the\nglass shard and lay on her side. She closed her eyes, feigning\nunconsciousness. The door swung open.\nJasnah gasped, immediately calling for help. She rushed to Shallan’s\nside, grabbing her arm and putting pressure on the wound. Shallan\nmumbled, as if she were barely conscious, gripping her safepouch—and the\nSoulcaster inside—with her safehand. They wouldn’t open it, would they?\nShe pulled her arm closer to her chest, cowering silently as more footsteps\nand calls sounded, servants and parshmen running into the room, Jasnah\nshouting for more help.\nThis, Shallan thought, will not end well.\n“Though I was due for dinner in Veden City that night, I insisted upon\nvisiting Kholinar to speak with Tivbet. The tariffs through Urithiru\nwere growing quite unreasonable. By then, the so-called Radiants had\nalready begun to show their true nature.”\n—Following the firing of the original Palanaeum, only one page of\nTerxim’s autobiography remained, and this is the only line of any use\nto me.\nKaladin dreamed he was the storm.\nHe raged forward, the stormwall behind him his trailing cape, soaring\nabove a heaving, black expanse. The ocean. His passing churned up a\ntempest, slamming waves into one another, lifting white caps to be caught\nin his wind.\nHe approached a dark continent and soared upward. Higher. Higher.\nHe left the sea behind. The vastness of the continent spread out before him,\nseemingly endless, an ocean of rock. So large, he thought, awed. He hadn’t\nunderstood.

They too\nwere larger than he’d expected; no wonder nobody had been able to find\ntheir way through the chasms.\nThere was a large plateau at the center, but with the darkness and the\ndistance, he could not see much. There were lights, though. Someone lived\nthere.\nHe did see that the eastern side of the plains was very different from\nthe western side, marked by tall, spindly pillars, plateaus that had nearly\nbeen worn away. Despite that, he could see a symmetry to the Shattered\nPlains. From high above, the plains resembled a work of art.\nIn a moment, he was past them, continuing north and west to soar\nacross the Sea of Spears, a shallow inland sea where broken fingers of rock\njutted above the water. He passed over Alethkar, catching a glimpse of the\ngreat city of Kholinar, built amid formations of rock like fins rising from the\nstone. Then he turned southward, away from anything he knew. He crested\nmajestic mountains, densely populated at their tips, with villages clustered\nnear vents that emitted steam or lava. The Horneater Peaks?\nHe left them with rain and winds, rumbling down into foreign lands.\nHe passed cities and open plains, villages and twisting waterways. There\nwere many armies. Kaladin passed tents pulled flat against the leeward\nsides of rock formations, stakes driven into the rock to hold them taut, men\nhidden inside. He passed hillsides where soldiers huddled in clefts. He\npassed large wooden wagons, built to house lighteyes while at war. How\nmany wars was the world fighting? Was there nowhere that was at peace?\nHe took a path to the southwest, blowing toward a city built in long\ntroughs in the ground that looked like giant claw marks ripped across the\nlandscape. He was over it in a flash, passing a hinterland where the stone\nitself was ribbed and rippled, like frozen waves of water. The people in this\nkingdom were dark-skinned, like Sigzil.\nThe land went on and on. Hundreds of cities. Thousands of villages.\nPeople with faintly blue veins beneath their skin. A place where the pressure\nof the approaching highstorm blew water out of spouts in the ground. A city\nwhere people lived in gigantic, hollowed-out stalactites hanging beneath a\ntitanic sheltered ridge.\nWestward he blew. The land was so vast. So enormous. So many\ndifferent people. It dazzled his mind. War seemed far less prevalent in the\nWest than it was in the East, and that comforted him, but still he was\ntroubled. Peace seemed a scarce commodity in the world.\nSomething drew his attention. Strange flashes of light. He blew toward\nthem at the forefront of the storm. What were those lights? They came in\nbursts, forming the strangest patterns. Almost like physical things that he\ncould reach out and touch, spherical bubbles of light that vibrated with\nspikes and troughs.\nKaladin crossed a strange city laid out in a triangular pattern, with tall\npeaks rising like sentries at the corners and center. The flashes of light were\ncoming from a building on the central peak. Kaladin knew he would pass"

The flashes of light were\ncoming from a building on the central peak. Kaladin knew he would pass\nquickly, for as the storm, he could not retreat. Ever westward he blew.\nHe threw open the door with his wind, entering a long hallway with\nbright red tile walls, mosaic murals that he passed too quickly to make out.\nHe rustled the skirts of tall, golden-haired serving women who carried trays\nof food or steaming towels. They called in a strange language, perhaps\nwondering who had left a window unbarred in a highstorm.\nThe flashes of light came from directly ahead. So transfixing. Brushing\npast a pretty gold-and red-haired woman who huddled frightened in a\ncorner, Kaladin burst through a door. He had one brief glimpse of what lay\nbeyond.\nA man stood over two corpses. His pale head shaved, his clothing\nwhite, the murderer held a long, thin sword in one hand. He looked up from\nhis victims and almost seemed to see Kaladin. He had large Shin eyes.\nIt was too late to see anything more. Kaladin blew out the window,\nthrowing shutters wide and streaking into the night.\nMore cities, mountains, and forests passed in a blur. At his advent,\nplants curled up their leaves, rockbuds closed their shells, and shrubs\nwithdrew their branches. Before long, he neared the western ocean.\nCHILD OF TANAVAST. CHILD OF HONOR. CHILD OF ONE LONG SINCE\nDEPARTED. The sudden voice shook Kaladin; he floundered in the air.\nTHE OOATHPACT WAS SHATTERED.\nThe booming sound made the stormwall itself vibrate. Kaladin hit the\nground, separating from the storm. He skidded to a stop, feet throwing up\nsprays of water. Stormwinds crashed into him, but he was enough a part of\nthem that they neither tossed nor shook him.\nMEN RIDE THE STORMS NO LONGER. The voice was thunder, crashing in\nthe air. THE OOATHPACT IS BROKEN, CHILD OF HONOR.\n“I don’t understand!” Kaladin screamed into the tempest.\nA face formed before him, the face he had seen before, the aged face\nas wide as the sky, its eyes full of stars.\nODIUM COMES. MOST DANGEROUS OF ALL THE SIXTEEN. YOU WILL NOW\nGO.\nSomething blew against him. “Wait!” Kaladin said. “Why is there so\nmuch war? Must we always fight?” He wasn’t sure why he asked. The\nquestions simply came out.\nThe storm rumbled, like a thoughtful aged father. The face vanished,\nshattering into droplets of water.\nMore softly, the voice answered, ODIUM REIGNS.\nKaladin gasped as he awoke. He was surrounded by dark figures, holding\nhim down against the hard stone floor. He yelled, old reflexes taking over.\nInstinctively, he snapped his hands outward to the sides, each grabbing an\nankle and jerking to pull two assailants off balance.\nThey cursed, crashing to the ground.

He knocked free the hands pushing\nhim down, rocked and threw himself forward, lurching into the man directly\nin front of him.\nKaladin rolled over him, tucking and coming up on his feet, free of his\ncaptives. He spun, flinging sweat from his brow. Where was his spear? He\nclutched for the knife at his belt.\nNo knife. No spear.\n“Storm you, Kaladin!” That was Teft.\nKaladin raised a hand to his breast, breathing deliberately, dispelling\nthe strange dream. Bridge Four. He was with Bridge Four. The king’s\nstormwardens had predicted a highstorm in the early morning hours.\n“It’s all right,” he said to the cursing, twisting clump of bridgemen\nwho had been holding him down. “What were you doing?”\n“You tried to go out in the storm,” Moash said accusingly, extricating\nhimself. The only light was a single diamond sphere one of the men had set\nin the corner.\n“Ha!” Rock added, standing up and brushing himself off. “Had the\ndoor open to the rain, staring out, as if you’d been hit on the head with\nstone. We had to pull you back. Is not good for you to spend another two\nweeks sick in bed, eh?”\nKaladin calmed himself. The riddens—the quiet rainfall at the trailing\nend of a highstorm—continued outside, drops sprinkling the roof.\n“You wouldn’t wake up,” Sigzil said. Kaladin glanced at the Azish\nman, sitting with his back to the stone wall. He hadn’t tried to hold Kaladin\ndown. “You were having some kind of fever dream.”\n“I feel just fine,” Kaladin said. That wasn’t quite true; his head ached\nand he was exhausted. He took a deep breath and threw back his shoulders,\ntrying to force the fatigue away.\nThe sphere in the corner flickered. Then its light faded away, leaving\nthem in darkness.\n“Storm it!” Moash muttered. “That eel Gaz. He’s been giving us dun\nspheres again.”\nKaladin crossed the pitch-black barrack, stepping carefully. His\nheadache faded away as he felt for the door. He pushed it open, letting in\nthe faint light of an overcast morning.\nThe winds were weak, but the rain still fell. He stepped out, and was\nshortly soaked through. The other bridgemen followed him out, and Rock\ntossed Kaladin a small chunk of soap. Like most of the others, Kaladin\nwore only his loincloth, and he lathered himself up in the cold downpour.\nThe soap smelled of oil and was gritty with the sand suspended in it. No\nsweet, soft soaps for bridgemen.\nKaladin tossed the bit of soap to Bisig, a thin bridgeman with an\nangular face. He took it gratefully—Bisig didn’t say much—and began to\nlather up as Kaladin let the rain wash the soap from his body and hair.

It made an odd counterpoint to his head, which he shaved up the\ncenter, from directly above the eyebrows back. He trimmed the rest of his\nhair short.\nRock’s hand was smooth and careful, and he didn’t so much as nick\nhimself. Once finished, he stood up and waved to the men waiting behind\nhim. One by one, he shaved any who wanted it. He occasionally paused to\nsharpen the razor using his whetstone and leather strop.\nKaladin raised his fingers to his own beard. He hadn’t been clean-\nshaven since he’d been in Amaram’s army, so long ago. He walked forward\nto join those waiting in line. When Kaladin’s time came, the large Horneater\nlaughed. “Sit, my friend, sit! Is good you have come. Your face is more like\nscragglebark branches than a proper beard.”\n“Shave it clean,” Kaladin said, sitting down on the stump. “And I’d\nrather not have a strange pattern like yours.”\n“Ha!” Rock said, sharpening his razor. “You are a lowlander, my good\nfriend. Is not right for you to wear a humaka’aban. I would have to thump\nyou soundly if you tried this thing.”\n“I thought you said fighting was beneath you.”\n“Is allowed several important exceptions,” Rock said. “Now stop with\nyour talking, unless you wish to be losing a lip.”\nRock began by trimming the beard down, then lathered and shaved,\nstarting at the left cheek. Kaladin had never let another shave him before;\nwhen he’d first gone to war, he’d been young enough that he’d barely\nneeded to shave at all. He’d grown into doing it himself as he got older.\nRock’s touch was deft, and Kaladin didn’t feel any nicks or cuts. In a\nfew minutes, Rock stood back. Kaladin raised his fingers to his chin,\ntouching smooth, sensitive skin. His face felt cold, strange to the touch. It\ntook him back, transformed him—just a little—into the man he had been.\nStrange, how much difference a shave could make. I should have done\nthis weeks ago.\nThe riddens had turned to drizzle, heralding the storm’s last whispers.\nKaladin stood up, letting the water wash bits of shorn hair from his chest.\nBaby-faced Dunny—the last of those waiting—sat down for his turn at\nbeing shaven. He hardly needed it at all.\n“The shave suits you,” a voice said. Kaladin turned to see Sigzil\nleaning against the wall of the barrack, just under the roof’s overhang.\n“Your face has strong lines. Square and firm, with a proud chin. We would\ncall it a leader’s face among my people.”\n“I’m no lighteyes,” Kaladin said, spitting to the side.\n“You hate them so much.”\n“I hate their lies,” Kaladin said. “I hate it that I used to believe they\nwere honorable.”\n“And would you cast them down?” Sigzil asked, sounding curious.\n“Rule in their place?”\n“No.”"

To the side, Syl finally appeared,\nhaving finished frolicking in the winds of the highstorm. He always worried\n—just a little—that she’d ride away with them and leave him.\n“Have you no thirst to punish those who have treated you so?” Sigzil\nasked.\n“Oh, I’m happy to punish them,” Kaladin said. “But I have no desire to\ntake their place, nor do I wish to join them.”\n“I’d join them in a heartbeat,” Moash said, walking up behind. He\nfolded his arms across his lean, well-muscled chest. “If I were in charge,\nthings would change. The lighteyes would work the mines and the fields.\nThey would run bridges and die by Parshendi arrows.”\n“Won’t happen,” Kaladin said. “But I won’t blame you for trying.”\nSigzil nodded thoughtfully. “Have either of you ever heard of the land\nof Babatharnam?”\n“No,” Kaladin said, glancing toward the camp. The soldiers were\nmoving about now. More than a few were washing too. “That a funny name\nfor a country, though.”\nSigzil sniffed. “Personally, I always thought Alethkar sounded like a\nridiculous name. I guess it depends on where you were raised.”\n“So why bring up Babab…” Moash said.\n“Babatharnam,” Sigzil said. “I visited there once, with my master.\nThey have very peculiar trees. The entire plant—trunk and all—lies down\nwhen a highstorm approaches, as if built on hinges. I was thrown in prison\nthree times during our visit there. The Babath are quite particular about how\nyou speak. My master was quite displeased at the amount he had to pay to\nfree me. Of course, I think they were using any excuse to imprison a\nforeigner, as they knew my master had deep pockets.” He smiled wistfully.\n“One of those imprisonments was my fault. The women there, you see,\nhave these patterns of veins that sit shallowly beneath their skin. Some\nvisitors find it unnerving, but I found the patterns beautiful. Almost\nirresistible…”\nKaladin frowned. Hadn’t he seen something like that in his dream?\n“I bring up Babath because they have a curious system of rule there,”\nSigzil continued. “You see, the elderly are given office. The older you are,\nthe more authority you have. Everyone gets a chance to rule, if they live\nlong enough. The king is called the Most Ancient.”\n“Sounds fair,” Moash said, walking over to join Sigzil beneath the\noverhang. “Better than deciding who rules based on eye color.”\n“Ah yes,” Sigzil said. “The Babath are very fair. Currently, the\nMonavakah Dynasty reigns.”\n“How can you have a dynasty if you choose your leaders based on\ntheir age?” Kaladin asked.\n“It’s actually quite easy,” Sigzil said. “You just execute anyone who\ngets old enough to challenge you.”\nKaladin felt a chill. “They do that?”"

It was dangerous to visit when we did. The Monavakahs\nmake very certain that their family members live the longest; for fifty years,\nno one outside their family has become Most Ancient. All others have fallen\nthrough assassination, exile, or death on the battlefield.”\n“That’s horrible,” Kaladin said.\n“I doubt many would disagree. But I mention these horrors for a\npurpose. You see, it has been my experience that no matter where you go,\nyou will find some who abuse their power.” He shrugged. “Eye color is not\nso odd a method, compared to many others I have seen. If you were to\noverthrow the lighteyes and place yourselves in power, Moash, I doubt that\nthe world would be a very different place. The abuses would still happen.\nSimply to other people.”\nKaladin nodded slowly, but Moash shook his head. “No. I’d change\nthe world, Sigzil. And I mean to.”\n“And how are you going to do that?” Kaladin asked, amused.\n“I came to this war to get myself a Shardblade,” Moash said. “And I\nstill mean to do it, somehow.” He blushed, then turned away.\n“You joined up assuming they’d make you a spearman, didn’t you?”\nKaladin asked.\nMoash hesitated, then nodded. “Some of those who joined with me did\nbecome soldiers, but most of us got sent to the bridge crews.” He glanced at\nKaladin, expression growing dark. “This plan of yours had better work,\nlordling. Last time I ran away, I got a beating. I was told if I tried again, I’d\nget a slave’s mark instead.”\n“I never promised it would work, Moash. If you’ve got a better idea,\ngo ahead and share it.”\nMoash hesitated. “Well, if you really do teach us the spear like you\npromised, then I guess I don’t care.”\nKaladin glanced about, warily checking to see if Gaz or any bridgemen\nfrom other crews were nearby. “Keep quiet,” Kaladin muttered to Moash.\n“Don’t speak of that outside of the chasms.” The rain had almost stopped;\nsoon the clouds would break.\nMoash glared at him, but remained silent.\n“You don’t really think they’d let you have a Shardblade, do you?”\nSigzil said.\n“Any man can win a Shardblade.” Moash said. “Slave or free.\nLighteyes or dark. It’s the law.”\n“Assuming they follow the law,” Kaladin said with a sigh.\n“I’ll do it somehow,” Moash repeated. He glanced to the side, where\nRock was closing up his razor and wiping the rainwater from his bald head.\nThe Horneater approached them. “I have heard of this place you spoke\nof, Sigzil,” Rock said. “Babatharnam. My cousin cousin cousin visited there\none time. They have very tasty snails.”\n“That is a long distance to travel for a Horneater,” Sigzil noted."

They have very tasty snails.”\n“That is a long distance to travel for a Horneater,” Sigzil noted.\n“Nearly same distance as for an Azish,” Rock said. “Actually, much\nmore, since you have such little legs!”\nSigzil scowled.\n“I have seen your kind before,” Rock said, folding his arms.\n“What?” Sigzil asked. “Azish? We are not so rare.”\n“No, not your race,” Rock said. “Your type. What is it they are called?\nVisiting places around the land, telling others of what they have seen? A\nWorldsinger. Yes, is the right name. No?”\nSigzil froze. Then he suddenly stood up straight and stalked away from\nthe barrack without looking back.\n“Now why is he acting like this thing?” Rock asked. “I am not\nashamed of being cook. Why is he ashamed of being Worldsinger?”\n“Worldsinger?” Kaladin asked.\nRock shrugged. “I do not know much. Are strange people. Say they\nmust travel to each kingdom and tell the people there of other kingdoms. Is\na kind of storyteller, though they are thinking of themselves as much more.”\n“He’s probably some kind of brightlord in his country,” Moash said.\n“The way he talks. Wonder how he ended up with us cremlings.”\n“Hey,” Dunny said, joining them. “What’d you do to Sigzil? He\npromised to tell me about my homeland.”\n“Homeland?” Moash said to the younger man. “You’re from Alethkar.”\n“Sigzil said these violet eyes of mine aren’t native to Alethkar. He\nthinks I must have Veden blood in me.”\n“Your eyes aren’t violet,” Moash said.\n“Sure they are,” Dunny said. “You can see it in bright sunlight.\nThey’re just really dark.”\n“Ha!” Rock said. “If you are from Vedenar, we are cousins! The Peaks\nare near Vedenar. Sometimes the people there have good red hair, like us!”\n“Be glad that someone didn’t mistake your eyes for red, Dunny,”\nKaladin said. “Moash, Rock, go gather your subsquads and pass the word to\nTeft and Skar. I want the men oiling their vests and sandals against the\nhumidity.”\nThe men sighed, but did as ordered. The army provided the oil. While\nthe bridgemen were expendable, good hogshide and metal for buckles were\nnot cheap.\nAs the men gathered to work, the sun broke through the clouds. The\nwarmth of the light felt good on Kaladin’s rain-wet skin. There was\nsomething refreshing about the chill of a highstorm followed by the sun.\nTiny rockbud polyps on the side of the building opened, drinking in the wet\nair. Those would have to be scraped free. Rockbuds would eat away the\nstone of the walls, creating pockmarks and cracks.\nThe buds were a deep crimson. It was Chachel, third day of the week.\nThe slave markets would show new wares. That would mean new\nbridgemen. Kaladin’s crew was in serious danger. Yake had caught an arrow\nin the arm during their last run, and Delp had caught one in the neck."

        "text": "bridgemen. Kaladin’s crew was in serious danger. Yake had caught an arrow\nin the arm during their last run, and Delp had caught one in the neck.\nThere’d been nothing Kaladin could do for him, and with Yake wounded,\nKaladin’s team was down to twenty-eight bridge-capable members.\nSure enough, about an hour into their morning activities—caring for\nequipment, oiling the bridge, Lopen and Dabbid running to fetch their\nmorning gruel pot and bring it back to the lumberyard—Kaladin caught\nsight of soldiers leading a line of dirty, shuffling men toward the\nlumberyard. Kaladin gestured to Teft, and the two of them marched up to\nmeet Gaz.\n“Afore you yell at me,” Gaz said as Kaladin arrived, “understand that I\ncan’t change anything here.” The slaves were bunched up, watched over by\na pair of soldiers in wrinkled green coats.\n“You’re bridge sergeant,” Kaladin said. Teft stepped up beside him. He\nhadn’t gotten a shave, though he’d begun keeping his short, grey beard\nneatly trimmed.\n“Yeah,” Gaz said, “but I don’t make assignments any more. Brightness\nHashal wants to do it herself. In the name of her husband, of course.”\nKaladin gritted his teeth. She’d starve Bridge Four of members. “So\nwe get nothing.”\n“I didn’t say that,” Gaz said, then spat black spittle to the side. “She\ngave you one.”\nThat’s something, at least, Kaladin thought. There were a good\nhundred men in the new group. “Which one? He’d better be tall enough to\ncarry a bridge.”\n“Oh, he’s tall enough,” Gaz said, gesturing a few slaves out of the way.\n“Good worker too.” The men shuffled aside, revealing one man standing at\nthe back. He was a little shorter than average, but he was still tall enough to\ncarry a bridge.\nBut he had black and red marbled skin.\n“A parshman?” Kaladin asked. To his side, Teft cursed under his\nbreath.\n“Why not?” Gaz said. “They’re perfect slaves. Never talk back.”\n“But we’re at war with them!” Teft said.\n“We’re at war with a tribe of oddities,” Gaz said. “Those out on the\nShattered Plains are right different from the fellows who work for us.”\nThat much, at least, was true. There were a lot of parshmen in the\nwarcamp, and—despite their skin markings—there was little similarity\nbetween them and the Parshendi warriors. None had the strange growths of\narmorlike carapace on their skin, for instance. Kaladin eyed the sturdy, bald\nman. The parshman stared at the ground; he wore only a loincloth, and he\nhad a thickness about him. His fingers were thicker than those of human\nmen, his arms stouter, his thighs wider.\n“He’s domesticated,” Gaz said. “You don’t need to worry.”\n“I thought parshmen were too valuable to use in bridge runs,” Kaladin\nsaid.\n“This is just an experiment,” Gaz said. “Brightness Hashal wants to\nknow her options. Finding enough bridgemen has been difficult lately, and\nparshmen could help fill in holes.”"

Finding enough bridgemen has been difficult lately, and\nparshmen could help fill in holes.”\n“This is foolishness, Gaz,” Teft said. “I don’t care if he’s\n‘domesticated’ or not. Asking him to carry a bridge against others of his\nkind is pure idiocy. What if he betrays us?”\nGaz shrugged. “We’ll see if that happens.”\n“But—”\n“Leave it, Teft,” Kaladin said. “You, parshman, come with me.” He\nturned to walk back down the hill. The parshman dutifully followed. Teft\ncursed and did so as well.\n“What trick are they trying on us, do you think?” Teft asked.\n“I suspect it’s just what he said. A test to see if a parshman can be\ntrusted to run bridges. Perhaps he’ll do as he’s told. Or perhaps he’ll refuse\nto run, or will try to kill us. She wins regardless.”\n“Kelek’s breath,” Teft cursed. “Darker than a Horneater’s stomach, our\nsituation is. She’ll see us dead, Kaladin.”\n“I know.” He glanced over his shoulder at the parshman. He was a\nlittle taller than most, his face a little wider, but they all looked about the\nsame to Kaladin.\nThe other members of Bridge Four had lined up by the time Kaladin\nreturned. They watched the approaching parshman with surprise and\ndisbelief. Kaladin stopped before them, Teft at his side, the parshman\nbehind. It made him itch, to have one of them behind him. He casually\nstepped to the side. The parshman just stood there, eyes downward,\nshoulders slumped.\nKaladin glanced at the others. They had guessed, and they were\ngrowing hostile.\nStormfather, Kaladin thought. There is something lower in this world\nthan a bridgeman. A parshman bridgeman. Parshmen might cost more than\nmost slaves, but so did a chull. In fact, the comparison was a good one,\nbecause parshmen were worked like animals.\nSeeing the reaction of the others made Kaladin pity the creature. And\nthat made him mad at himself. Did he always have to react this way? This\nparshman was dangerous, a distraction for the other men, a factor they\ncouldn’t depend on.\nA liability.\nTurn a liability into an advantage whenever you can.. Those words had\nbeen spoken by a man who cared only for his own skin.\nStorm it, Kaladin thought. I’m a fool. A downright, sodden idiot. This\nisn’t the same. Not at all. “Parshman,” he asked. “Do you have a name?”\nThe man shook his head. Parshmen rarely spoke. They could, but you\nhad to prod them into it.\n“Well, we’ll have to call you something,” Kaladin said. “How about\nShen?”\nThe man shrugged.\n“All right then,” Kaladin said to the others. “This is Shen. He’s one of\nus now.”\n“A parshman?” Lopen asked, lounging beside the barrack. “I don’t like\nhim, gancho. Look how he stares at me.”"

Look how he stares at me.”\n“He’ll kill us while we sleep,” Moash added.\n“No, this is good,” Skar said. “We can just have him run at the front.\nHe’ll take an arrow for one of us.”\nSyl alighted on Kaladin’s shoulder, looking down at the parshman. Her\neyes were sorrowful.\nIf you were to overthrow the lighteyes and place yourselves in power,\nabuses would still happen. They’d just happen to other people.\nBut this was a parshman.\nGotta do what you can to stay alive….\n“No,” Kaladin said. “Shen is one of us now. I don’t care what he was\nbefore. I don’t care what any of you were. We’re Bridge Four. So is he.”\n“But—” Skar began.\n“No,” Kaladin said. “We not going to treat him like the lighteyes treat\nus, Skar. That’s all there is to it. Rock, find him a vest and sandals.”\nThe bridgemen split up, all save Teft. “What about…our plans?” Teft\nasked quietly.\n“We proceed,” Kaladin said.\nTeft looked uncomfortable about that.\n“What’s he going to do, Teft?” Kaladin asked. “Tell on us? I’ve never\nheard a parshman say more than a single word at a time. I doubt he could\nact as a spy.”\n“I don’t know,” Teft grumbled. “But I’ve never liked them. They seem\nto be able to talk to each other, without making any sounds. I don’t like the\nway they look.”\n“Teft,” Kaladin said flatly, “if we rejected bridgemen based on their\nlooks, we’d have kicked you out weeks ago for that face of yours.”\nTeft grunted. Then he smiled.\n“What?” Kaladin asked.\n“Nothing,” he said. “Just…for a moment, you reminded me of better\ndays. Afore this storm came crashing down on me. You realize the odds,\ndon’t you? Fighting our way free, escaping a man like Sadeas?”\nKaladin nodded solemnly.\n“Good,” Teft said. “Well, since you aren’t inclined to do it, I’ll keep an\neye on our friend ‘Shen’ over there. You can thank me after I stop him from\nsticking a knife in your back.”\n“I don’t think we have to worry.”\n“You’re young,” Teft said. “I’m old.”\n“That makes you wiser, presumably?”\n“Damnation no,” Teft said. “The only thing it proves is that I’ve more\nexperience staying alive than you. I’ll watch him. You just train the rest of\nthis sorry lot to…” He trailed off, looking around. “To keep from tripping\nover their own feet the moment someone threatens them. You understand?”\nKaladin nodded. That sounded much like something one of Kaladin’s\nold sergeants would say. Teft was insistent on not talking about his past, but\nhe never had seemed as beaten down as most of the others.\n“All right,” Kaladin said, “make sure the men take care of their\nequipment.”\n“What will you be doing?”"

He’d need to\nreturn to the lumberyard soon; his men were on chasm duty again, and had\nbeen given only a few free hours to care for equipment.\nAs a youth, he hadn’t understood why his father had often gone\nwalking to think. The older Kaladin grew, the more he found himself\nimitating his father’s habits. Walking, moving, it did something to his mind.\nThe constant passing of tents, colors cycling, men bustling—it created a\nsense of change, and it made his thoughts want to move as well.\nDon’t hedge bets with your life, Kaladin, Durk had always said. Don’t\nput in a chip when you have a pocket full of marks. Bet them all or leave the\ntable.\nSyl danced before him, jumping from shoulder to shoulder in the\ncrowded street. Occasionally she’d land on the head of someone passing in\nthe other direction and sit there, legs crossed, as she passed Kaladin. All his\nspheres were on the table. He was determined to help the bridgemen. But\nsomething itched at him, a worry that he couldn’t yet explain.\n“You seem troubled,” Syl said, landing on his shoulder. She wore a cap\nand jacket over her usual dress, as if imitating nearby shop keepers. They\npassed the apothecary’s shop. Kaladin barely bothered to glance at it. He\nhad no knobweed sap to sell. He’d run out of supplies soon.\nHe’d told his men that he’d train them to fight, but that would take\ntime. And once they were trained, how would they get spears out of the\nchasms to use in the escape? Sneaking them out would be tough,\nconsidering how they were searched. They could just start fighting at the\nsearch itself, but that would only put the entire warcamp on alert.\nProblems, problems. The more he thought, the more impossible his\ntask seemed.\nHe made way for a couple of soldiers in forest-green coats. Their\nbrown eyes marked them as common citizens, but the white knots on their\nshoulders meant they were citizen officers. Squadleaders and sergeants.\n“Kaladin?” Syl asked.\n“Getting the bridgemen out is as large a task as I’ve ever faced. Much\nmore difficult than my other escape attempts as a slave, and I failed at each\nof those. I can’t help wondering if I’m setting myself up for another\ndisaster.”\n“It will be different this time, Kaladin,” Syl said. “I can feel it.”\n“That sounds like something Tien would have said. His death proves\nthat words don’t change anything, Syl. Before you ask, I’m not sinking into\ndespair again. But I can’t ignore what has happened to me. It started with\nTien. Since that moment, it seems that every time I’ve specifically picked\npeople to protect, they’ve ended up dead. Every time. It’s enough to make\nme wonder if the Almighty himself hates me.”\nShe frowned. “I think you’re being foolish. Besides, if anything, he’d"

Besides, if anything, he’d\nhate the people who died, not you. You lived.”\n“I suppose it’s self-centered to make it all about me. But, Syl, I\nsurvive, every time, when almost nobody else does. Over and over again.\nMy old spearman’s squad, the first bridge crew I ran with, numerous slaves\nI tried to help escape. There’s a pattern. It’s getting harder and harder to\nignore.”\n“Maybe the Almighty is preserving you,” Syl said.”\nKaladin hesitated on the street; a passing soldier cursed and shoved\nhim aside. Something about this whole conversation was wrong. Kaladin\nmoved over beside a rain barrel set between two sturdy stone-walled shops.\n“Syl,” he said. “You mentioned the Almighty.”\n“You did first.”\n“Ignore that for now. Do you believe in the Almighty? Do you know if\nhe really exists?”\nSyl cocked her head. “I don’t know. Huh. Well, there are a lot of things\nI don’t know. But I should know this one. I think. Maybe?” She seemed\nvery perplexed.\n“I’m not sure if I believe,” Kaladin said, looking out at the street. “My\nmother did, and my father always spoke of the Heralds with reverence. I\nthink he believed too, but maybe just because of the traditions of healing\nthat are said to have come from the Heralds. The ardents ignore us\nbridgemen. They used to visit the soldiers, when I was in Amaram’s army,\nbut I haven’t seen a single one in the lumberyard. I haven’t given it much\nthought. Believing never seemed to help any of the soldiers.”\n“So if you don’t believe, then there’s no reason to think that the\nAlmighty hates you.”\n“Except,” Kaladin said, “if there is no Almighty, there might be\nsomething else. I don’t know. A lot of the soldiers I knew were\nsuperstitious. They’d talk about things like the Old Magic and the\nNightwatcher, things that could bring a man bad luck. I scoffed at them. But\nhow long can I continue to ignore that possibility? What if all of these\nfailures can be traced to something like that?”\nSyl looked disturbed. The cap and jacket she’d been wearing dissolved\nto mist, and she wrapped her arms around herself as if chilled by his\ncomments.\nOdium reigns….\n“Syl,” he said, frowning, thinking back to his strange dream. “Have\nyou ever heard of something called Odium? I don’t mean the feeling, I\nmean…a person, or something called by that name.”\nSyl suddenly hissed. It was a feral, disturbing sound. She zipped off\nhis shoulder, becoming a darting streak of light, and shot up underneath the\neaves of the next building.\nHe blinked. “Syl?” he called, drawing the attention of a couple of\npassing washwomen.

Kaladin spun as a man\nburst out of a handsome stone building across the street and shoved a half-\nnaked woman out in front of him. The man had bright blue eyes, and his\ncoat—carried over one arm—had red knots on the shoulder. A lighteyed\nofficer, not very high-ranking. Perhaps seventh dahn.\nThe half-dressed woman fell to the ground. She held the loose front of\nthe dress to her chest, crying, her long black hair down and tied with two\nred ribbons. The dress was that of a lighteyed woman, except that both\nsleeves were short, safehand exposed. A courtesan.\nThe officer continued to curse as he pulled on his coat. He didn’t do up\nthe buttons. Instead, he stepped forward and kicked the whore in the belly.\nShe gasped, painspren pulling from the ground and gathering around her.\nNobody on the street paused, though most did hurry on their way, heads\ndown.\nKaladin growled, jumping into the roadway, pushing his way past a\ngroup of soldiers. Then he stopped. Three men in blue stepped out of the\ncrowd, moving purposefully between the fallen woman and the officer in\nred. Only one was lighteyed, judging by the knots on his shoulders. Golden\nknots. A high-ranking man indeed, second or third dahn. These obviously\nweren’t from Sadeas’s army, not with those well-pressed blue coats.\nSadeas’s officer hesitated. The officer in blue rested his hand on the\nhilt of his sword. The other two were holding fine halberds with gleaming\nhalf-moon heads.\nA group of soldiers in red moved out of the crowd and began to\nsurround those in blue. The air grew tense, and Kaladin realized that the\nstreet—bustling just moments ago—was quickly emptying. He stood\npractically alone, the only one watching the three men in blue, now\nsurrounded by seven in red. The woman was still on the ground, sniffling.\nShe huddled next to the blue garbed officer.\nThe man who had kicked her—a thick-browed brute with a mop of\nuncombed black hair—began to button up the right side of his coat. “You\ndon’t belong here, friends. It seems you wandered into the wrong\nwarcamp.”\n“We have legitimate business,” said the officer in blue. He had light\ngolden hair, speckled with Alethi black, and a handsome face. He held his\nhand before him as if wishing to shake hands with Sadeas’s officer. “Come\nnow,” he said affably. “Whatever your problem with this woman, I’m sure it\ncan be resolved without anger or violence.”\nKaladin moved back under the overhang where Syl had hidden.\n“She’s a whore,” Sadeas’s man said.\n“I can see that,” replied the man in blue. He kept his hand out.\nThe officer in red spat on it.\n“I see,” said the blond man.

He pulled his hand back, and twisting\nlines of mist gathered in the air, coalescing in his hands as he raised them to\nan offensive posture. A massive sword appeared, as long as a man is tall.\nIt dripped with water that condensed along its cold, glimmering length.\nIt was beautiful, long and sinuous, its single edge rippled like an eel and\ncurved up into a point. The back bore delicate ridges, like crystal\nformations.\nSadeas’s officer stumbled away and fell, his face pale. The soldiers in\nred scattered. The officer cursed at them—as vile a curse as Kaladin had\never heard—but none returned to help him. With a final glare, he scrambled\nup the steps back into the building.\nThe door slammed, leaving the roadway eerily silent. Kaladin was the\nonly one on the street besides the soldiers in blue and the fallen courtesan.\nThe Shardbearer gave Kaladin a glance, but obviously judged him no threat.\nHe thrust his sword into the stones; the blade sank in easily and stood with\nits hilt toward the sky.\nThe young Shardbearer then gave his hand to the fallen whore. “What\ndid you do to him, out of curiosity?”\nHesitantly, she took his hand and let him pull her to her feet. “He\nrefused to pay, claiming his reputation made it a pleasure for me.” She\ngrimaced. “He kicked me the first time after I made a comment about his\n‘reputation.’ It apparently wasn’t what he thought he was known for.”\nThe brightlord chuckled. “I suggest you insist on being paid first from\nnow on. We’ll escort you to the border. I advise against returning to\nSadeas’s warcamp anytime soon.”\nThe woman nodded, holding the front of her dress to her chest. Her\nsafehand was still exposed. Sleek, with tan skin, the fingers long and\ndelicate. Kaladin found himself staring at it and blushing. She sidled up to\nthe brightlord while his two comrades watched the sides of the streets,\nhalberds ready. Even with her hair disheveled and her makeup smudged,\nshe was quite pretty. “Thank you, Brightlord. Perhaps I could interest you?\nThere would be no charge.”\nThe young brightlord raised an eyebrow. “Tempting,” he said, “but my\nfather would kill me. He has this thing about the old ways.”\n“A pity,” she said, pulling away from him, awkwardly covering her\nchest as she slipped her arm into its sleeve. She took out a glove for her\nsafehand. “Your father is quite prudish, then?”\n“You might say that.” He turned toward Kaladin. “Ho, bridgeboy.”\nBridgeboy? This lordling looked to be just a few years older than\nKaladin himself.\n“Run and give word to Brightlord Reral Makoram,” the Shardbearer\nsaid, flipping something across the street toward Kaladin. A sphere. It\nsparkled in the sunlight before Kaladin caught it. “He’s in the Sixth\nBattalion. Tell him that Adolin Kholin won’t make today’s meeting.

More than he\nnormally earned in two weeks. He looked up; the young brightlord and his\ntwo men were already retreating, the whore following.\n“You rushed to help her,” a voice said. He looked up as Syl floated\ndown to rest on his shoulder. “That was very noble of you.”\n“Those others got there first,” Kaladin said. And one of them a\nlighteyes, no less. What was in it for him?\n“You still tried to help.”\n“Foolishly,” Kaladin said. “What would I have done? Fought down a\nlighteyes? That would have drawn half the camp’s soldiers down on me,\nand the whore would just have been beaten more for causing such a fracas.\nShe could have ended up dead for my efforts.” He fell silent. That sounded\ntoo much like what he’d been saying before.\nHe couldn’t give in to assuming he was cursed, or had bad luck, or\nwhatever it was. Superstition never got a man anywhere. But he had to\nadmit, the pattern was disturbing. If he acted as he always had before, how\ncould he expect different results? He had to try something new. Change,\nsomehow. This was going to take more thought.\nKaladin began walking back toward the lumberyard.\n“Aren’t you going to do what the brightlord asked?” Syl said. She\ndidn’t show any lingering effects of her sudden fright; it was as if she\nwanted to pretend it hadn’t happened.\n“After how he treated me?” Kaladin snapped.\n“It wasn’t that bad.”\n“I’m not going to bow to them,” Kaladin said. “I’m done running at\ntheir whims just because they expect me to do so. If he was so worried\nabout this message, then he should have waited to make certain I was\nwilling.”\n“You took his sphere.”\n“Earned by the sweat of the darkeyes he exploits.”\nSyl fell silent for a moment. “This darkness about you when you talk\nof them frightens me, Kaladin. You stop being yourself when you think\nabout lighteyes.”\nHe didn’t respond, just continuing on his way. He owed that brightlord\nnothing, and besides, he had orders to be back in the lumberyard.\nBut the man had stepped up to protect the woman.\nNo, Kaladin told himself forcefully. He was just looking for a way to\nembarrass one of Sadeas’s officers. Everyone knows there’s tension between\nthe camps.\nAnd that was all he let himself think on the subject.\nONE YEAR AGO\nKaladin turned the rock over in his fingers, letting the facets of suspended\nquartz catch the light. He leaned against a large boulder, one foot pressed\nback against the stone, his spear next to him.\nThe rock caught the light, spinning it in different colors, depending on\nthe direction he turned it. Beautiful, miniature crystals shimmered, like the\ncities made of gemstones mentioned in lore.\nAround him, Highmarshal Amaram’s army prepared for battle. Six\nthousand men sharpened spears or strapped on leather armor. The battlefield\nwas nearby, and, with no highstorms expected, the army had spent the night\nin tents."

In the near distance, Amaram’s standard was already\nflying, a burgundy field blazoned with a dark green glyphpair shaped like a\nwhitespine with tusks upraised. Merem and khakh, honor and determination.\nThe banner fluttered before a rising sun, the morning’s chill starting to give\nway to the heat of the day.\nKaladin turned, looking eastward. Toward a home to which he could\nnever return. He’d decided months ago. His enlistment would be up in a\nfew weeks, but he would sign on again. He couldn’t face his parents after\nhaving broken his promise to protect Tien.\nA heavyset darkeyed soldier trotted up to him, an axe strapped to his\nback, white knots on his shoulders. The nonstandard weapon was a\nprivilege of being a squadleader. Gare had beefy forearms and a thick black\nbeard, though he’d lost a large section of scalp on the right side of his head.\nHe was followed by two of his sergeants—Nalem and Korabet.\n“Kaladin,” Gare said. “Stormfather, man! Why are you pestering me?\nOn a battle day!”\n“I’m well aware of what’s ahead, Gare,” Kaladin said, arms still\nfolded. Several companies were already gathering, forming ranks. Dallet\nwould see Kaladin’s own squad into place. At the front, they’d decided.\nTheir enemy—a lighteyes named Hallaw—was fond of long volleys.\nThey’d fought his men several times before. One time in particular was\nburned into Kaladin’s memory and soul.\nHe had joined Amaram’s army expecting to defend the Alethi borders\n—and defend them he did. Against other Alethi. Lesser landlords who\nsought to slice off bits of Highprince Sadeas’s lands. Occasionally,\nAmaram’s armies would try to seize territory from other highprinces—lands\nAmaram claimed really belonged to Sadeas and had been stolen years\nbefore. Kaladin didn’t know what to make of that. Of all lighteyes, Amaram\nwas the only one he trusted. But it did seem like they were doing the same\nthing as the armies they fought.\n“Kaladin?” Gare asked impatiently.\n“You have something I want,” Kaladin said. “New recruit, just joined\nyesterday. Galan says his name is Cenn.”\nGare scowled. “I’m supposed to play this game with you now? Talk to\nme after the battle. If the boy survives, maybe I’ll give him to you.” He\nturned to leave, cronies following.\nKaladin stood up straight, picking up his spear. The motion stopped\nGare in his tracks.\n“It’s not going to be a trouble to you,” Kaladin said quietly. “Just send\nthe boy to my squad. Accept your payment. Stay quiet.” He pulled out a\npouch of spheres."

Stay quiet.” He pulled out a\npouch of spheres.\n“Maybe I don’t want to sell him,” Gare said, turning back.\n“You’re not selling him. You’re transferring him to me.”\nGare eyed the pouch. “Well then, maybe I don’t like how everyone\ndoes what you tell them. I don’t care how good you are with a spear. My\nsquad is my own.”\n“I’m not going to give you any more, Gare,” Kaladin said, dropping\nthe pouch to the ground. The spheres clinked. “We both know the boy is\nuseless to you. Untrained, ill-equipped, too small to make a good line\nsoldier. Send him to me.”\nKaladin turned and began to walk away. Within seconds, he heard a\nclink as Gare recovered the pouch. “Can’t blame a man for trying.”\nKaladin kept walking.\n“What do these recruits mean to you, anyway?” Gare called after\nKaladin. “Your squad is half made up of men too small to fight properly!\nAlmost makes a man think you want to get killed!”\nKaladin ignored him. He passed through the camp, waving to those\nwho waved at him. Most everyone kept out of his way, either because they\nknew and respected him or they’d heard of his reputation. Youngest\nsquadleader in the army, only four years of experience and already in\ncommand. A darkeyed man had to travel to the Shattered Plains to go any\nhigher in rank.\nThe camp was a bedlam of soldiers hurrying about in last-minute\npreparations. More and more companies were gathering at the line, and\nKaladin could see the enemy lining up on the shallow ridge across the field\nto the west.\nThe enemy. That was what they were called. Yet whenever there was\nan actual border dispute with the Vedens or the Reshi, those men would line\nup beside Amaram’s troops and they would fight together. It was as if the\nNightwatcher toyed with them, playing some forbidden game of chance,\noccasionally setting the men on his gameboard as allies, then setting them\nto kill one another the next day.\nThat wasn’t for spearmen to think about. So he’d been told.\nRepeatedly. He supposed he should listen, as he figured that his duty was to\nkeep his squad alive as best he could. Winning was secondary to that.\nYou can’t kill to protect….\nHe found the surgeon’s station easily; he could smell the scents of\nantiseptics and of small fires burning. Those smells reminded him of his\nyouth, which now seemed so far, far away. Had he ever really planned to go\nbecome a surgeon? What had happened to his parents? What of Roshone?\nMeaningless, now. He’d sent word to them via Amaram’s scribes, a\nterse note that had cost him a week’s wages. They knew he’d failed, and\nthey knew he didn’t intend to return. There had been no reply.\nVen was the chief of the surgeons, a tall man with a bulbous nose and a\nlong face. He stood watching as his apprentices folded bandages.

Kaladin\nhad once idly considered getting wounded so he could join them; all of the\napprentices had some incapacitation that prevented them from fighting.\nKaladin hadn’t been able to do it. Wounding himself seemed cowardly.\nBesides, surgery was his old life. In a way, he didn’t deserve it anymore.\nKaladin pulled a pouch of spheres from his belt, meaning to toss it to\nVen. The pouch stuck, however, refusing to come free of the belt. Kaladin\ncursed, stumbling, tugging at the pouch. It came free suddenly, causing him\nto lose his balance again. A translucent white form zipped away, spinning\nwith a carefree air.\n“Storming windspren,” he said. They were common out on these rocky\nplains.\nHe continued past the surgery pavilion, tossing the pouch of spheres to\nVen. The tall man caught it deftly, making it vanish into a pocket of his\nvoluminous white robe. The bribe would ensure that Kaladin’s men were\nserved first on the battlefield, assuming there were no lighteyes who needed\nthe attention.\nIt was time to join the line. He sped up, jogging along, spear in hand.\nNobody gave him grief for wearing trousers under his leather spearman’s\nskirt—something he did so his men could recognize him from behind. In\nfact, nobody gave him grief about much of anything these days. That still\nfelt odd, after so many struggles during his first years in the army.\nHe still didn’t feel as if he belonged. His reputation set him apart, but\nwhat was he to do? It kept his men from being taunted, and after several\nyears of dealing with disaster after disaster, he could finally pause and think.\nHe wasn’t certain he liked that. Thinking had proven dangerous lately.\nIt had been a long while since he’d taken out that rock and thought of Tien\nand home.\nHe made his way to the front ranks, spotting his men right where he’d\ntold them to go. “Dallet,” Kaladin called, as he trotted over to the\nmountainous spearman who was the squad’s sergeant. “We’re soon going to\nhave a new recruit. I need you to…” He trailed off. A young man, maybe\nfourteen, stood beside Dallet, looking tiny in his spearman’s armor.\nKaladin felt a flash of recall. Another lad, one with a familiar face,\nholding a spear he wasn’t supposed to need. Two promises broken at once.\n“He found his way here just a few minutes ago, sir,” Dallet said. “I’ve\nbeen gettin’ him ready.”\nKaladin shook himself out of the moment. Tien was dead. But\nStormfather, this new lad looked a lot like him.\n“Well done,” Kaladin said to Dallet, forcing himself to look away from\nCenn. “I paid good money to get that boy away from Gare. That man’s so\nincompetent he might as well be fighting for the other side.”\nDallet grunted in agreement. The men would know what to do with\nCenn.\nAll right, Kaladin thought, scanning the battlefield for a good place for\nhis men to stand their ground, let’s get to it.\nHe’d heard stories about the soldiers who fought on the Shattered"

The real soldiers. If you showed enough promise fighting in these\nborder disputes, you were sent there. It was supposed to be safer there—far\nmore soldiers, but fewer battles. So Kaladin wanted to get his squad there as\nsoon as possible.\nHe conferred with Dallet, picking a place to hold. Eventually, the\nhorns blew.\nKaladin’s squad charged.\n“Where’s the boy?” Kaladin said, yanking his spear out of the chest of a\nman in brown. The enemy soldier fell to the ground, groaning. “Dallet!”\nThe burly sergeant was fighting. He couldn’t turn to acknowledge the\nyell.\nKaladin cursed, scanning the chaotic battlefield. Spears hit shields,\nflesh, leather; men yelled and screamed. Painspren swarmed the ground,\nlike small orange hands or bits of sinew, reaching up from the ground amid\nthe blood of the fallen.\nKaladin’s squad was all accounted for, their wounded protected at the\ncenter. All except the new boy. Tien.\nCenn, Kaladin thought. His name is Cenn.\nKaladin caught sight of a flash of green in the middle of the enemy\nbrown. A terrified voice somehow cut through the commotion. It was him.\nKaladin threw himself out of formation, prompting a call of surprise\nfrom Larn, who had been fighting at his side. Kaladin ducked past a spear\nthrust by an enemy, dashing over the stony ground, hopping corpses.\nCenn had been knocked to the ground, spear raised. An enemy soldier\nslammed his weapon down.\nNo.\nKaladin blocked the blow, deflecting the enemy spear and skidding to\na stop in front of Cenn. There were six spearmen here, all wearing brown.\nKaladin spun among them in a wild offensive rush. His spear seemed to\nflow of its own accord. He swept the feet out from under one man, took\ndown another with a thrown knife.\nHe was like water running down a hill, flowing, always moving.\nSpearheads flashed in the air around him, hafts hissing with speed. Not one\nhit him. He could not be stopped, not when he felt like this. When he had\nthe energy of defending the fallen, the power of standing to protect one of\nhis men.\nKaladin snapped his spear into a resting position, crouching with one\nfoot forward, one behind, spear held under his arm. Sweat trickled from his\nbrow, cooled by the breeze. Odd. There hadn’t been a breeze before. Now it\nseemed to envelop him.\nAll six enemy spearmen were dead or incapacitated. Kaladin breathed\nin and out once, then turned to see to Cenn’s wound. He dropped his spear\nbeside him, kneeling. The cut wasn’t that bad, though it probably pained the\nlad terribly.\nGetting out a bandage, Kaladin gave the battlefield one quick glance.\nNearby, an enemy soldier stirred, but he was wounded badly enough that he\nwouldn’t be trouble.

In the near distance, an enemy lighteyes of high\nrank was rallying a small group of soldiers for a counterattack. He wore full\nplate. Not Shardplate, of course, but silvery steel. A rich man, judging from\nhis horse.\nIn a heartbeat, Kaladin was back to binding Cenn’s leg—though he\nkept watch on the wounded enemy soldier from the corner of his eye.\n“Kaladin, sir!” Cenn exclaimed, pointing at the soldier who had\nstirred. Stormfather! Had the boy only just noticed the man? Had Kaladin’s\nbattle senses ever been as dull as this boy’s?\nDallet pushed the wounded enemy away. The rest of the squad made a\nring formation around Kaladin, Dallet, and Cenn. Kaladin finished his\nbinding, then stood, picking up his spear.\nDallet handed him back his knives. “Had me worried there, sir.\nRunning off like that.”\n“I knew you’d follow,” Kaladin said. “Raise the red banner. Cyn,\nKorater, you’re going back with the boy. Dallet, hold here. Amaram’s line is\nbulging this direction. We should be safe soon.”\n“And you, sir?” Dallet asked.\nIn the near distance, the lighteyes had failed to rally enough troops. He\nwas exposed, like a stone left behind by a stream running dry.\n“A Shardbearer,” Cenn said.\nDallet snorted. “No, thank the Stormfather. Just a lighteyed officer.\nShardbearers are far too valuable to waste on a minor border dispute.”\nKaladin clenched his jaw, watching that lighteyed warrior. How\nmighty the man thought himself, sitting on his expensive horse, kept safe\nfrom the spearmen by his majestic armor and tall mount. He swung his\nmace, killing those around him.\nThese skirmishes were caused by ones like him, greedy minor\nlighteyes who tried to steal land while the better men were away, fighting\nthe Parshendi. His type had far, far fewer casualties than the spearmen, and\nso the lives under his command became cheap things.\nMore and more over the last few years, each and every one of these\npetty lighteyes had come to represent Roshone in Kaladin’s eyes. Only\nAmaram himself stood apart. Amaram, who had treated Kaladin’s father so\nwell, promising to keep Tien safe. Amaram, who always spoke with respect,\neven to lowly spearmen. He was like Dalinar and Sadeas. Not this riffraff.\nOf course, Amaram had failed to protect Tien. But so had Kaladin.\n“Sir?” Dallet said hesitantly.\n“Subsquads Two and Three, pincer pattern,” Kaladin said coldly,\npointing at the enemy lighteyes. “We’re taking a brightlord off his throne.”\n“You sure that’s wise, sir?” Dallet said. “We’ve got wounded.”\nKaladin turned toward Dallet. “That’s one of Hallaw’s officers. He\nmight be the one.”\n“You don’t know that, sir.”\n“Regardless, he’s a battalionlord. If we kill an officer that high, we’re"

If we kill an officer that high, we’re\nall but guaranteed to be in the next group sent to the Shattered Plains. We’re\ntaking him. Imagine it, Dallet. Real soldiers. A warcamp with discipline and\nlighteyes with integrity. A place where our fighting will mean something.”\nDallet sighed, but nodded. At Kaladin’s wave, two subsquads joined\nhim, as eager as he. Did they hate these squabbling lighteyes of their own\naccord, or had they picked up Kaladin’s loathing?\nThe brightlord was surprisingly easy to take down. The problem with\nthem—almost to a man—was that they underestimated darkeyes. Perhaps\nthis one had a right. How many had he killed, in his years?\nSubsquad three drew off the honor guard. Subsquad two distracted\nthe lighteyes. He didn’t see Kaladin approaching from a third direction. The\nman dropped with a knife to the eye; his face was unprotected. He screamed\nas he clattered to the ground, still alive. Kaladin rammed his spear down\ninto the fallen man’s face, striking three times as the horse galloped off.\nThe man’s honor guard panicked and fled to rejoin their army. Kaladin\nsignaled to the two subsquads by banging his spear against his shield,\ngiving the “hold position” sign. They fanned out, and short Toorim—a man\nKaladin had rescued from another squad—made as if to confirm the light-\neyes was dead. He was really covertly looking for spheres.\nStealing from the dead was strictly prohibited, but Kaladin figured that\nif Amaram wanted the spoils, he could storming well kill the enemy\nhimself. Kaladin respected Amaram more than most—well, more than any\n—lighteyes. But bribes weren’t cheap.\nToorim walked up to him. “Nothing sir. Either he didn’t bring any\nspheres into battle, or he has them hidden somewhere under that\nbreastplate.”\nKaladin nodded curtly, surveying the battlefield. Amaram’s forces\nwere recovering; they’d win the day before long. In fact, Amaram would\nprobably be leading a direct surge against the enemy by now. He generally\nentered the battle at the end.\nKaladin wiped his brow. He’d have to send for Norby, their\ncaptainlord, to prove their kill. First he needed those healers to—\n“Sir!” Toorim said suddenly.\nKaladin glanced back at the enemy lines.\n“Stormfather!” Toorim exclaimed. “Sir!”\nToorim wasn’t looking at the enemy lines. Kaladin spun, looking back\nat friendly ranks. There—bearing down through the soldiers on a horse the\ncolor of death itself—was an impossibility.\nThe man wore shining golden armor. Perfect golden armor, as if this\nwere what every other suit of armor had been designed to imitate. Each\npiece fit perfectly; there were no holes showing straps or leather. It made\nthe rider look enormous, powerful. Like a god carrying a majestic blade that\nshould have been too big to use.

He’d been riding\nthrough them, cutting down men as he passed. For a brief moment,\nKaladin’s mind refused to acknowledge that this creature—this beautiful\ndivinity—could be an enemy. The fact that the Shardbearer had come\nthrough their side reinforced that illusion.\nKaladin’s confusion lasted right up until the moment the Shardbearer\ntrampled Cenn, Shardblade dropping and cutting through Dallet’s head in a\nsingle, easy stroke.\n“No!” Kaladin bellowed. “No!”\nDallet’s body fell back to the ground, eyes seeming to catch alight,\nsmoke rising from them. The Shardbearer cut down Cyn and trampled\nLyndel before moving on. It was all done with nonchalance, like a woman\npausing to wipe a spot on the counter.\n“NO!” Kaladin screamed, charging toward the fallen men of his squad.\nHe hadn’t lost anyone this battle! He was going to protect them all!\nHe fell to his knees beside Dallet, dropping his spear. But there was no\nheartbeat, and those burned-out eyes…He was dead. Grief threatened to\noverwhelm Kaladin.\nNo! said the part of his mind trained by his father. Save the ones you\ncan!\nHe turned to Cenn. The boy had taken a hoof to the chest, cracking his\nsternum and shattering ribs. The boy gasped, eyes upward, struggling for\nbreath. Kaladin pulled out a bandage. Then he paused, looking at it. A\nbandage? To mend a smashed chest?\nCenn stopped wheezing. He convulsed once, eyes still open. “He\nwatches!” the boy hissed. “The black piper in the night. He holds us in his\npalm…playing a tune that no man can hear!”\nCenn’s eyes glazed over. He stopped breathing.\nLyndel’s face had been smashed in. Cyn’s eyes smoldered, and he\nwasn’t breathing either. Kaladin knelt in Cenn’s blood, horrified, as Toorim\nand the two subsquads formed around him, looking as stunned as Kaladin\nfelt.\nThis isn’t possible. I…I…\nScreaming.\nKaladin looked up. Amaram’s banner of green and burgundy flew just\nto the south. The Shardbearer had cut through Kaladin’s squad heading\nstraight for that banner. Spearmen fled in disarray, screaming, scattering\nbefore the Shardbearer.\nAnger boiled inside of Kaladin.\n“Sir?” Toorim asked.\nKaladin picked up his spear and stood. His knees were covered with\nCenn’s blood. His men regarded him, confused, worried. They stood firm in\nthe midst of the chaos; as far as Kaladin could tell, they were the only men\nwho weren’t fleeing. The Shardbearer had turned the ranks to mush.\nKaladin thrust his spear into the air, then began to run. His men\nbellowed a war cry, falling into formation behind him, charging across the\nflat rocky ground. Spearmen in uniforms of both colors scrambled out of the\nway, dropping spears and shields."

The only ones going the wrong way. Some of\nthe fleeing men paused as he charged past, but none joined.\nAhead, the Shardbearer rode past Amaram. With a sweep of the Blade,\nthe Shardbearer slashed through the neck of Amaram’s mount. Its eyes\nburned into two great pits, and it toppled, jerking fitfully, Amaram still in its\nsaddle.\nThe Shardbearer wheeled his destrier in a tight circle, then threw\nhimself from horseback at full speed. He hit the ground with a grinding\nsound, somehow remaining upright and skidding to a halt.\nKaladin redoubled his speed. Was he running to get vengeance, or was\nhe trying to protect his highmarshal? The only lighteyes who had ever\nshown a modicum of humanity? Did it matter?\nAmaram struggled in his bulky plate, the carcass of the horse on his\nleg.\nThe Shardbearer raised his Blade in two hands to finish him off.\nComing at the Shardbearer from behind, Kaladin screamed and swung\nlow with the butt of his spear, putting momentum and muscle behind the\nblow. The spear haft shattered against the Shardbearer’s back leg in a spray\nof wooden slivers.\nThe jolt of it knocked Kaladin to the ground, his arms shaking, the\nbroken spear clutched in his hands. The Shardbearer stumbled, lowering his\nBlade. He turned a helmed face toward Kaladin, posture indicating utter\nsurprise.\nThe twenty remaining men of Kaladin’s squad arrived a heartbeat later,\nattacking vigorously.

He shook a helmed head.\nThen he struck.\nThe Shardblade swept out in a broad sweeping series of deadly\nstrokes, cutting through ten of the spearmen.\nKaladin was paralyzed in horror as Toorim, Acis, Hamel, and seven\nothers fell to the ground, eyes burning, their armor and weapons sheared\ncompletely through.

Kaladin cursed, throwing himself backward just as the\nBlade sliced the air in front of him. Kaladin rebounded and lunged forward.\nHe made an expert thrust at his enemy’s neck.

He looked around at\nthe bodies of men who had been his dearest friends.\n“Take it, Kaladin,” Coreb said.\nKaladin turned, looking at the Shardblade, which sprouted at an angle\ninto the stone, hilt toward the sky.\n“Take it,” Coreb said again. “It’s yours. Stormfather, Kaladin. You’re a\nShardbearer!”\nKaladin stepped forward, dazed, raising his hand toward the hilt of the\nBlade. He hesitated just an inch away from it.\nEverything felt wrong.\nIf he took that Blade, he’d become one of them. His eyes would even\nchange, if the stories were right. Though the Blade glistened in the light,\nclean of the murders it had performed, for a moment it seemed red to him.\nStained with Dallet’s blood. Toorim’s blood. The blood of the men who had\nbeen alive just moments before.\nIt was a treasure. Men traded kingdoms for Shardblades. The handful\nof darkeyed men who had won them lived forever in song and story.\nBut the thought of touching that Blade sickened him. It represented\neverything he’d come to hate about the lighteyes, and it had just slaughtered\nmen he loved dearly. He could not become a legend because of something\nlike that. He looked at his reflection in the Blade’s pitiless metal, then\nlowered his hand and turned away.\n“It’s yours, Coreb,” Kaladin said. “I give it to you.”\n“What?” Coreb said from behind.\nAhead, Amaram’s honor guard had finally returned, apprehensively\nappearing at the top of the small hollow, looking ashamed.\n“What are you doing?” Amaram demanded as Kaladin passed him.\n“What—Aren’t you going to take the Blade?”\n“I don’t want it,” Kaladin said softly. “I’m giving it to my men.”"

Skin that is burned.”\n—Cormshen, page 104.\nShallan sat quietly, propped up in a sterile, white-sheeted bed in one of\nKharbranth’s many hospitals. Her arm was wrapped in a neat, crisp\nbandage, and she held her drawing board in front of her. The nurses had\nreluctantly allowed her to sketch, so long as she did not “stress herself.”\nHer arm ached; she’d sliced herself more deeply than she’d intended.\nShe’d hoped to simulate a wound from breaking the pitcher; she hadn’t\nthought far enough ahead to realize how much like a suicide attempt it\nmight seem. Though she’d protested that she’d simply fallen from bed, she\ncould see that the nurses and ardents didn’t accept it. She couldn’t blame\nthem.\nThe results were embarrassing, but at least nobody thought she might\nhave Soulcast to make that blood. Embarrassment was worth escaping\nsuspicion.\nShe continued her sketch. She was in a large, hallwaylike room in a\nKharbranthian hospital, the walls lined with many beds. Other than obvious\naggravations, her two days in the hospital had gone fairly well. She’d had a\nlot of time to think about that strangest of afternoons, when she’d seen\nghosts, transformed glass to blood, and had an ardent offer to resign the\nardentia to be with her.\nShe’d done several drawings of this hospital room. The creatures\nlurked in her sketches, staying at the distant edges of the room. Their\npresence made it difficult for her to sleep, but she was slowly growing\naccustomed to them.\nThe air smelled of soap and lister’s oil; she was bathed regularly and\nher arm washed with antiseptic to frighten away rotspren. About half of the\nbeds held sick women, and there were wheeled fabric dividers with wooden\nframes that could be rolled around a bed for privacy. Shallan wore a plain\nwhite robe that untied at the front and had a long left sleeve that tied shut to\nprotect her safehand.\nShe’d transferred her safepouch to the robe, buttoning it inside the left\nsleeve. Nobody had looked in the pouch. When she’d been washed, they’d\nunbuttoned it and given it to her without a word, despite its unusual weight.\nOne did not look in a woman’s safepouch. Still, she kept hold of it\nwhenever she could.\nIn the hospital, her every need was seen to, but she could not leave. It\nreminded her of being at home on her father’s estates. More and more, that\nfrightened her as much as the symbolheads did. She’d tasted independence,\nand she didn’t want to go back to what she had been.

Her supposed suicide attempt gave her an excellent reason to return\nhome. She had to go. To remain, sending the Soulcaster away on its own,\nwould be selfish considering this opportunity to leave without arousing\nsuspicion. Besides, she’d used the Soulcaster. She could use the long trip\nhome to figure out how she’d done it, then be ready to help her family when\nshe arrived.\nShe sighed, and then with a few shadings, she finished her sketch. It\nwas a picture of that strange place she had gone. That distant horizon with\nits powerful yet cold sun. Clouds running toward it above, endless ocean\nbelow, making the sun look as if it were at the end of a long tunnel. Above\nthe ocean hovered hundreds of flames, a sea of lights above the sea of glass\nbeads.\nShe lifted the picture up, looking at the sketch underneath. It depicted\nher, huddled on her bed, surrounded by the strange creatures. She didn’t\ndare tell Jasnah what she had seen, lest it reveal that she had Soulcast, and\ntherefore committed the theft.\nThe next picture was one of her, lying on the ground amid the blood.\nShe looked up from the sketchpad. A white-clothed female ardent sat\nagainst the wall nearby, pretending to sew but really keeping watch in case\nShallan decided to harm herself again. Shallan made a thin line of her lips.\nIt’s a good cover, she told herself. It works perfectly. Stop being so\nembarrassed.\nShe turned to the last of her day’s sketches. It depicted one of the\nsymbolheads. No eyes, no face, just that jagged alien symbol with points\nlike cut crystal. They had to have something to do with the Soulcasting.\nDidn’t they?\nI visited another place, she thought. I think…I think I spoke with the\nspirit of the goblet. Did a goblet, of all things, have a soul? Upon opening\nher pouch to check on the Soulcaster, she’d found that the sphere Kabsal\nhad given her had stopped glowing. She could remember a vague feeling of\nlight and beauty, a raging storm inside of her.\nShe’d taken the light from the sphere and given it to the goblet—the\nspren of the goblet—as a bribe to transform. Was that how Soulcasting\nworked? Or was she just struggling to make connections?\nShallan lowered the sketchpad as visitors entered the room and began\nmoving among the patients. Most of the women sat up excitedly as they\nsaw King Taravangian, with his orange robes and kindly, aged air. He\npaused at each bed to chat. She’d heard that he visited frequently, at least\nonce a week.\nEventually he reached Shallan’s bedside. He smiled at her, sitting as\none of his many attendants placed a padded stool for him. “And young\nShallan Davar. I was so terribly saddened to hear of your accident. I\napologize for not coming earlier. Duties of state kept me.”\n“It is quite all right, Your Majesty.”\n“No, no, it is not,” he said. “But it is what must be. There are many"

There are many\nwho complain that I spend too much of my time here.”\nShallan smiled. Those complaints were never vociferous. The\nlandlords and house lords who played politics in court were quite content\nwith a king who spent so much of his time outside the palace, ignoring their\nschemes.\n“This hospital is amazing, Your Majesty,” she said. “I can’t believe\nhow well everyone is cared for.”\nHe smiled widely. “My great triumph. Lighteyes and darkeyes alike,\nnobody turned away—not beggar, not whore, not sailor from afar. It’s all\npaid for by the Palanaeum, you know. In a way, even the most obscure and\nuseless record is helping heal the sick.”\n“I’m glad to be here.”\n“I doubt that, child. A hospital such as this one is, perhaps, the only\nthing a man could pour so much money into and be delighted if it were\nnever used. It is a tragedy that you must become my guest.”\n“What I meant was that I’d rather be sick here than somewhere else.\nThough I suppose that’s a little like saying it’s better to choke on wine than\non dishwater.”\nHe laughed. “What a sweet thing you are,” he said, rising. “Is there\nanything I can do to improve your stay?”\n“End it?”\n“I’m afraid that I can’t allow that,” he said, eyes softening. “I must\ndefer to the wisdom of my surgeons and nurses. They say that you are still\nat risk. We must think of your health.”\n“Keeping me here gives me health at the expense of my wellness, Your\nMajesty.”\nHe shook his head. “You mustn’t be allowed to have another accident.”\n“I…I understand. But I promise that I’m feeling much better. The\nepisode that struck me was caused by overwork. Now that I’m relaxed, I’m\nnot in any further danger.”\n“That is good,” he said. “But we still need to keep you for a few more\ndays.”\n“Yes, Your Majesty. But could I at least have visitors?” So far, the\nhospital staff had insisted that she was not to be bothered.\n“Yes…I can see how that might help you. I’ll speak to the ardents and\nsuggest that you be allowed a few visitors.” He hesitated. “Once you are\nwell again, it might be best for you to suspend your training.”\nShe pasted a grimace on her face, trying not to feel sick at the charade.\n“I hate to do that, Your Majesty. But I have been missing my family greatly.\nPerhaps I should return to them.”\n“An excellent idea. I’m certain the ardents will be more likely to\nrelease you if they know you’ll be going home.” He smiled in a kindly way,\nresting a hand on her shoulder. “This world, it is a tempest sometimes. But\nremember, the sun always rises again.”\n“Thank you, Your Majesty.”\nThe king moved away, visiting other patients, then speaking quietly\nwith the ardents.

Not five minutes passed before Jasnah walked through the\ndoorway with her characteristic straight-backed stride. She wore a beautiful\ndress, deep blue with golden embroidery. Her sleek black hair was done in\nbraids and pierced by six thin golden spikes; her cheeks glowed with blush,\nher lips bloodred with lip paint. She stood out in the white room like a\nflower upon a field of barren stone.\nShe glided toward Shallan on feet hidden beneath the loose folds of\nher silk skirt, carrying a thick book under her arm. An ardent brought her a\nstool, and she sat down where the king had just stood.\nJasnah regarded Shallan, face stiff, impassive. “I have been told that\nmy tutelage is demanding, perhaps harsh. This is one reason why I often\nrefuse to take wards.”\n“I apologize for my weakness, Brightness,” Shallan said, looking\ndown.\nJasnah seemed displeased. “I did not mean to suggest fault in you,\nchild. I was attempting the opposite. Unfortunately I’m…unaccustomed to\nsuch behavior.”\n“Apologizing?”\n“Yes.”\n“Well, you see,” Shallan said, “in order to grow proficient at\napologizing, you must first make mistakes. That’s your problem, Jasnah.\nYou’re absolutely terrible at making them.”\nThe woman’s expression softened. “The king mentioned to me that\nyou would be returning to your family.”\n“What? When?”\n“When he met me in the hallway outside,” she said, “and finally gave\nme permission to visit you.”\n“You make it sound as if you were waiting out there.”\nJasnah didn’t reply.\n“But your research!”\n“Can be done in the hospital waiting chamber.” She hesitated. “It has\nbeen somewhat difficult for me to focus these last few days.”\n“Jasnah! That’s quite nearly human of you!”\nJasnah regarded her reprovingly, and Shallan winced, immediately\nregretting the words. “I’m sorry. I’ve learned poorly, haven’t I?”\n“Or perhaps you are just practicing the art of the apology. So that you\nwill not be unsettled when the need arises, as I am.”\n“How very clever of me.”\n“Indeed.”\n“Can I stop now, then?” Shallan asked. “I think I’ve had quite enough\npractice.”\n“I should think,” Jasnah said, “that apology is an art of which we could\nuse a few more masters. Do not use me as a model in this. Pride is often\nmistaken for faultlessness.” She leaned forward. “I am sorry, Shallan Davar.\nIn overworking you, I may have done the world a disservice and stolen\nfrom it one of the great scholars of the rising generation.”\nShallan blushed, feeling more foolish and guilty. Shallan’s eyes\nflickered to her mistress’s hand. Jasnah wore the black glove that hid the\nfake. In the fingers of her safehand, Shallan grasped the pouch holding the\nSoulcaster. If Jasnah only knew.\nJasnah took the book from beneath her arm and set it on the bed beside\nShallan. “This is for you.”\nShallan picked it up. She opened to the front page, but it was blank."

She opened to the front page, but it was blank.\nThe next one was as well, as were all inside of it. Her frown deepened, and\nshe looked up at Jasnah.\n“It’s called the Book of Endless Pages,” Jasnah said.\n“Er, I’m pretty sure it’s not endless, Brightness.” She flipped to the last\npage and held it up.\nJasnah smiled. “It’s a metaphor, Shallan. Many years ago, someone\ndear to me made a very good attempt at converting me to Vorinism. This\nwas the method he used.”\nShallan cocked her head.\n“You search for truth,” Jasnah said, “but you also hold to your faith.\nThere is much to admire in that. Seek out the Devotary of Sincerity. They\nare one of the very smallest of the devotaries, but this book is their guide.”\n“One with blank pages?”\n“Indeed. They worship the Almighty, but are guided by the belief that\nthere are always more answers to be found. The book cannot be filled, as\nthere is always something to learn. This devotary is a place where one is\nnever penalized for questions, even those challenging Vorinism’s own\ntenets.” She shook her head. “I cannot explain their ways. You should be\nable to find them in Vedenar, though there are none in Kharbranth.”\n“I…” Shallan trailed off, noticing how Jasnah’s hand rested fondly on\nthe book. It was precious to her. “I hadn’t thought to find ardents who were\nwilling to question their own beliefs.”\nJasnah raised an eyebrow. “You will find wise men in any religion,\nShallan, and good men in every nation. Those who truly seek wisdom are\nthose who will acknowledge the virtue in their adversaries and who will\nlearn from those who disabuse them of error. All others—heretic, Vorin,\nYsperist, or Maakian—are equally closed-minded.” She took her hand from\nthe book, moving as if to stand up.\n“He’s wrong,” Shallan said suddenly, realizing something.\nJasnah turned to her.\n“Kabsal,” Shallan said, blushing. “He says you’re researching the\nVoidbringers because you want to prove that Vorinism is false.”\nJasnah sniffed in derision. “I would not dedicate four years of my life\nto such an empty pursuit. It’s idiocy to try to prove a negative. Let the Vorin\nbelieve as they wish—the wise among them will find goodness and solace\nin their faith; the fools would be fools no matter what they believed.”\nShallan frowned. So why was Jasnah studying the Voidbringers?\n“Ah. Speak of the storm and it begins to bluster,” Jasnah said, turning\ntoward the room’s entrance.\nWith a start, Shallan realized that Kabsal had just arrived, wearing his\nusual grey robes. He was arguing softly with a nurse, who pointed at the\nbasket he carried. Finally, the nurse threw up her hands and walked away,\nleaving Kabsal to approach, triumphant. “Finally!” he said to Shallan. “Old"

After all, I know what you need to make you\nbetter!” He pulled out a jar of jam, smiling broadly.\nJasnah remained on her stool, regarding Kabsal across the bed. “I\nwould have thought,” she said dryly, “that you would allow Shallan a\nrespite, considering how your attentions drove her to despair.”\nKabsal flushed. He looked at Shallan, and she could see the pleading in\nhis eyes.\n“It wasn’t you, Kabsal,” Shallan said. “I just…I wasn’t ready for life\naway from my family estate. I still don’t know what came over me. I’ve\nnever done anything like that before.”\nHe smiled, pulling a stool over for himself. “I think,” he said, “that the\nlack of color in these places is what keeps people sick so long. That and\nthe lack of proper food.” He winked, turning the jar toward Shallan. It was\ndeep, dark red. “Strawberry.”\n“Never heard of it,” Shallan said.\n“It’s exceedingly rare,” Jasnah said, reaching for the jar. “Like most\nplants from Shinovar, it can’t grow other places.”\nKabsal looked surprised as Jasnah removed the lid and dipped a finger\ninto the jar. She hesitated, then raised a bit of the jam to her nose to sniff at\nit.\n“I was under the impression that you disliked jam, Brightness Jasnah,”\nKabsal said.\n“I do,” she said. “I was simply curious about the scent. I’ve heard that\nstrawberries are very distinctive.” She screwed the lid back on, then wiped\nher finger on her cloth handkerchief.\n“I brought bread as well,” Kabsal said. He pulled out a small loaf of\nthe fluffy bread. “It’s nice of you not to blame me, Shallan, but I can see\nthat my attentions were too forward. I thought, maybe, I could bring this\nand…”\n“And what?” Jasnah asked. “Absolve yourself? ‘I’m sorry I drove you\nto suicide. Here’s some bread.’”\nHe blushed, looking down.\n“Of course I’ll have some,” Shallan said, glaring at Jasnah. “And she\nwill too. It was very kind of you, Kabsal.” She took the bread, breaking off\na chunk for Kabsal, one for herself, then one for Jasnah.\n“No,” Jasnah said. “Thank you.”\n“Jasnah,” Shallan said. “Would you please at least try some?” It\nbothered her that the two of them got on so poorly.\nThe older woman sighed. “Oh, very well.” She took the bread, holding\nit as Shallan and Kabsal ate.

There were stories of evil men made immortal,\nthen tortured over and over again—like Extes, who had his arms torn off\neach day for sacrificing his son to the Voidbringers in exchange for\nknowledge of the day of his death. It was just a tale, but tales came from\nsomewhere.\nKaladin lived when everyone else died. Was that the work of some\nspren from Damnation, toying with him like a windspren, but infinitely\nmore nefarious? Letting him think that he might be able to do some good,\nthen killing everyone he tried to help? There were supposed to be thousands\nof kinds of spren, many that people never saw or didn’t know about. Syl\nfollowed him. Could some kind of evil spren be doing the same?\nA very disturbing thought."

        "text": "of kinds of spren, many that people never saw or didn’t know about. Syl\nfollowed him. Could some kind of evil spren be doing the same?\nA very disturbing thought.\nSuperstition is useless, he told himself forcefully. Think on it too much,\nand you’ll end up like Durk, insisting that you need to wear your lucky\nboots into every battle.\nThey reached a section where the chasm forked, splitting around a\nplateau high above. Kaladin turned to face the bridgemen. “This is as good\na place as any.” The bridgemen stopped, bunching up. He could see the\nanticipation in their eyes, the excitement.\nHe’d felt that once, back before he’d known the soreness and the pain\nof practice. Oddly, Kaladin felt he was now both more in awe of and more\ndisappointed in the spear than he’d been as a youth. He loved the focus, the\nfeeling of certainty that he felt when he fought. But that hadn’t saved those\nwho followed him.\n“This is where I’m supposed to tell you what a sorry group you are,”\nKaladin said to the men. “It’s the way I’ve always seen it done. The training\nsergeant tells the recruits that they are pathetic. He points out their\nweakness, perhaps spars with a few of them, tossing them on their\nbacksides to teach them humility. I did that a few times myself when\ntraining new spearmen.”\nKaladin shook his head. “Today, that’s not how we’ll begin. You men\ndon’t need humbling. You don’t dream of glory. You dream of survival.\nMost of all, you aren’t the sad, unprepared group of recruits most sergeants\nhave to deal with. You’re tough. I’ve seen you run for miles carrying a\nbridge. You’re brave. I’ve seen you charge straight at a line of archers.\nYou’re determined. Otherwise you wouldn’t be here, right now, with me.”\nKaladin walked to the side of the chasm and extracted a discarded\nspear from some flood-strewn rubble. Once he had it, however, he realized\nthat the spearhead had been knocked off. He almost tossed it aside, then\nreconsidered.\nSpears were dangerous for him to hold. They made him want to fight,\nand might lead him to think he was who he’d once been: Kaladin\nStormblessed, confident squadleader. He wasn’t that man any longer.\nIt seemed that whenever he picked up weapons, the people around him\ndied—friends as well as foes. So, for now, it seemed good to hold this\nlength of wood; it was just a staff. Nothing more. A stick he could use for\ntraining.\nHe could face returning to the spear another time.\n“It’s good that you’re already prepared,” Kaladin said to the men.\n“Because we don’t have the six weeks I was given to train a new batch of\nrecruits. In six weeks, Sadeas will have half of us dead. I intend to see you\nall drinking mudbeer in a tavern somewhere safe by the time six weeks\nhave passed.”\nSeveral of them gave a kind of half-cheer at that.\n“We’ll have to be fast,” Kaladin said. “I’ll have to push you hard."

        "text": "have passed.”\nSeveral of them gave a kind of half-cheer at that.\n“We’ll have to be fast,” Kaladin said. “I’ll have to push you hard.\nThat’s our only option.” He glanced at the spear haft. “The first thing you\nneed to learn is that it’s all right to care.”\nThe twenty-three bridgemen stood in a double row. All had wanted to\ncome. Even Leyten, who had been hurt so badly. They didn’t have any who\nwere wounded so badly they couldn’t walk, although Dabbid continued\nto stare off at nothing. Rock stood with his arms folded, apparently with\nno intention of learning to fight. Shen, the parshman, stood at the very back.\nHe looked at the ground. Kaladin didn’t intend to put a spear in his hands.\nSeveral of the bridgemen seemed confused by what Kaladin had said\nabout emotions, though Teft just raised an eyebrow and Moash yawned.\n“What do you mean?” Drehy asked. He was a lanky blond man, long-\nlimbed and muscled. He spoke with a faint accent; he was from somewhere\nfar to the west, called Rianal.\n“A lot of soldiers,” Kaladin said, running his thumb across the pole,\nfeeling the grain of the wood, “they think that you fight the best if you’re\npassionless and cold. I think that’s stormleavings. Yes, you need to be\nfocused. Yes, emotions are dangerous. But if you don’t care about anything,\nwhat are you? An animal, driven only to kill. Our passion is what makes us\nhuman. We have to fight for a reason. So I say that it’s all right to care.\nWe’ll talk about controlling your fear and anger, but remember this as the\nfirst lesson I taught you.”\nSeveral of the bridgemen nodded. Most seemed confused still. Kaladin\nremembered being there, wondering why Tukks wasted time talking about\nemotions. He’d thought he understood emotion—his drive to learn the spear\nhad come because of his emotions. Vengeance. Hatred. A lust for the power\nto exact retribution on Varth and the soldiers of his squad.\nHe looked up, trying to banish those memories. No, the bridgemen\ndidn’t understand his words about caring, but perhaps they would remember\nlater, as Kaladin had.\n“The second lesson,” Kaladin said, slapping the decapitated spear to\nthe rock beside him with a crack that echoed down the chasm, “is more\nutilitarian. Before you can learn to fight, you’re going to have to learn how\nto stand.” He dropped the spear. The bridgemen watched him with frowns\nof disappointment.\nKaladin fell into a basic spearman’s stance, feet wide apart—but not\ntoo wide—turned sideways, knees bent in a loose crouch. “Skar, I want you\nto come try to push me backward.”\n“What?”\n“Try and throw me off balance,” Kaladin said. “Force me to stumble.”\nSkar shrugged and walked forward. He tried to shove Kaladin back,\nbut Kaladin easily knocked his hands aside with a quick snap of the wrist.\nSkar cursed and came at him again, but Kaladin caught his arm and shoved\nhim backward, causing Skar to stumble."

Try to force\nme off balance.”\nThe other two joined Skar. Kaladin stepped around the attacks, staying\nsquarely in the middle of them, adjusting his stance to rebuff each attempt.\nHe grabbed Drehy’s arm and yanked him forward, nearly causing him to\nfall. He stepped into Skar’s shoulder-rush, deflecting the weight of the\nman’s body and throwing him backward. He pulled back as Moash got his\narms on him, causing Moash to overbalance himself.\nKaladin remained completely unfazed, weaving between them and\nadjusting his center of balance by bending his knees and positioning his\nfeet. “Combat begins with the legs,” Kaladin said as he evaded the attacks.\n“I don’t care how fast you are with a jab, how accurate you are with a\nthrust. If your opponent can trip you, or make you stumble, you’ll lose.\nLosing means dying.”\nSeveral of the watching bridgemen tried to imitate Kaladin, crouching\ndown. Skar, Drehy, and Moash had finally decided to try a coordinated rush,\nplanning to all tackle Kaladin at once. Kaladin held up his hand. “Well\ndone, you three.” He motioned them back to stand with the others. They\nreluctantly broke off their attacks.\n“I’m going to split you into pairs,” Kaladin said. “We’re going to\nspend all day today—and probably each day this week—working on\nstances. Learning to maintain one, learning to not lock your knees the\nmoment you’re threatened, learning to hold your center of balance. It will\ntake time, but I promise you if we start here, you’ll learn to be deadly far\nmore quickly. Even if it seems that all you’re doing at first is standing\naround.”\nThe men nodded.\n“Teft,” Kaladin ordered. “Split them into pairs by size and weight, then\nrun them through an elementary forward spear stance.”\n“Aye, sir!” Teft barked. Then he froze, realizing what he’d given away.\nThe speed at which he’d responded made it obvious that Teft had been a\nsoldier. Teft met Kaladin’s eyes and saw that Kaladin knew. The older man\nscowled, but Kaladin returned a grin. He had a veteran under his command;\nthat was going to make this all a lot easier.\nTeft didn’t feign ignorance, and easily fell into the role of the training\nsergeant, splitting the men into pairs, correcting their stances. No wonder he\nnever takes off that shirt, Kaladin thought. It probably hides a mess of\nscars.\nAs Teft instructed the men, Kaladin pointed to Rock, gesturing him\nover.\n“Yes?” Rock asked. The man was so broad of chest that his\nbridgeman’s vest could barely fasten.\n“You said something before,” Kaladin said. “About fighting being\nbeneath you?”\n“Is true. I am not a fourth son.”\n“What does that have to do with it?”\n“First son and second son are needed for making food,” Rock said,"

I am not a fourth son.”\n“What does that have to do with it?”\n“First son and second son are needed for making food,” Rock said,\nraising a finger. “Is most important. Without food, nobody lives, yes? Third\nson is craftsman. This is me. I serve proudly. Only fourth son can be\nwarrior. Warriors, they are not needed as much as food or crafts. You see?”\n“Your profession is determined by your birth order?”\n“Yes,” Rock said proudly. “Is best way. On the Peaks, there is always\nfood. Not every family has four sons. So not always is a soldier needed. I\ncannot fight. What man could do this thing before the Uli’tekanaki?”\nKaladin shot a glance at Syl. She shrugged, not seeming to care what\nRock did. “All right,” he said. “I’ve got something else I want you to do,\nthen. Go grab Lopen, Dabbid…” Kaladin hesitated. “And Shen. Get him\ntoo.”\nRock did so. Lopen was in the line, learning the stances, though\nDabbid—as usual—stood off to the side, staring at nothing in particular.\nWhatever had taken him, it was far worse than regular battle shock. Shen\nstood beside him, hesitant, as if not certain of his place.\nRock pulled Lopen out of the line, then grabbed Dabbid and Shen and\nwalked back to Kaladin.\n“Gancho,” Lopen said, with a lazy salute. “Guess I’ll make a poor\nspearman, with one hand.”\n“That’s all right,” Kaladin said. “I have something else I need you to\ndo. We’ll see trouble from Gaz and our new captain—or at least his wife—\nif we don’t bring back salvage.”\n“We three cannot do the work of thirty, Kaladin,” Rock said,\nscratching at his beard. “Is not possible.”\n“Maybe not,” Kaladin said. “But most of our time down in these\nchasms is spent looking for corpses that haven’t been picked clean. I think\nwe can work a lot faster. We need to work a lot faster, if we’re going to train\nwith the spear. Fortunately, we have an advantage.”\nHe held out his hand, and Syl alighted on it. He’d spoken to her earlier,\nand she’d agreed to his plan. He didn’t notice her doing anything special,\nbut Lopen suddenly gasped. Syl had made herself visible to him.\n“Ah…” Rock said, bowing in respect to Syl. “Like gathering reeds.”\n“Well flick my sparks,” Lopen said. “Rock, you never said it was so\npretty!”\nSyl smiled broadly.\n“Be respectful,” Rock said. “Is not for you to speak of her in that way,\nlittle person.”\nThe men knew about Syl, of course. Kaladin didn’t speak of her, but\nthey saw him talking to the air, and Rock had explained.\n“Lopen,” Kaladin said. “Syl can move far more quickly than a\nbridgeman. She will search out places for you to gather, and you four can\npick through things quickly.”\n“Dangerous,” Rock said. “What if we meet chasmfiend while alone?”"

The last thing we\nwant is Hashal deciding to send Gaz down to supervise.”\nLopen snorted. “He’d never do that, gancho. Too much work down\nhere.”\n“Too dangerous too,” Rock added.\n“Everyone says that,” Kaladin said. “But I’ve never seen more than\nthese scrapes on the walls.”\n“They’re down here,” Rock said. “Is not just legend. Just before you\ncame, half a bridge crew was killed. Eaten. Most beasts come to the middle\nplateaus, but there are some who come this far.”\n“Well, I hate to put you in danger, but unless we try this, we’ll have\nchasm duty taken from us and we’ll end up cleaning latrines instead.”\n“All right, gancho,” Lopen said. “I’ll go.”\n“As will I,” Rock said. “With ali’i’kamura to protect, perhaps it will\nbe safe.”\n“I intend to teach you to fight eventually,” Kaladin said. Then as Rock\nfrowned, Kaladin hastily added, “You, Lopen, I mean. One arm doesn’t\nmean you’re useless. You’ll be at a disadvantage, but there are things I can\nteach you to deal with that. Right now a scavenger is more important to us\nthan another spear.”\n“Sounds swift to me.” Lopen gestured to Dabbid, and the two walked\nover to gather sacks for the collecting. Rock moved to join them, but\nKaladin took his arm.\n“I haven’t given up on finding an easier way out of here than fighting,”\nKaladin said to him. “If we never returned, Gaz and the others would\nprobably just assume that a chasmfiend got us. If there’s some way to reach\nthe other side…”\nRock looked skeptical. “Many have searched for this thing.”\n“The eastern edge is open.”\n“Yes,” Rock said, laughing, “and when you are able to travel that far\nwithout being eaten by chasmfiend or killed in floods, I shall name you my\nkaluk’i’iki.”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow.\n“Only a woman can be kaluk’i’iki,” Rock said, as if that explained the\njoke.\n“Wife?”\nRock laughed even louder. “No, no. Airsick lowlanders. Ha!”\n“Great. Look, see if you can memorize the chasms, perhaps make a\nmap of some kind. I suspect that most who come down here stick to the\nestablished routes. That means we’re much more likely to find salvage\ndown side passages; that’s where I’ll be sending Syl.”\n“Side passages?” Rock said, still amused. “One might begin to think\nyou want me to be eaten. Ha, and by a greatshell. They are supposed to be\ntasted, not tasting.”\n“I—”\n“No, no,” Rock said. “Is a good plan. I only jest. I can be careful, and\nthis will be good for me to do, since I do not wish to fight.”\n“Thank you. Maybe you’ll happen upon a place we could climb out.”"

        "text": "this will be good for me to do, since I do not wish to fight.”\n“Thank you. Maybe you’ll happen upon a place we could climb out.”\n“I will do this thing,” Rock said, nodding. “But we cannot simply\nclimb out. The army has many scouts on the Plains. Is how they know when\nchasmfiends come to pupate, eh? They will see us, and we will not be able\nto cross chasms without bridge.”\nIt was a good argument, unfortunately. Climb up here, and they’d be\nseen. Climb out in the middle, and they’d be stuck on plateaus without\nanywhere to go. Climb out closer to the Parshendi areas, and they’d be\nfound by their scouts. That was assuming they could get out of the chasms.\nThough some were as shallow as forty or fifty feet, many were well over a\nhundred feet deep.\nSyl zipped away to lead Rock and his crew, and Kaladin moved back\nto the main body of bridgemen to help Teft correct stances. It was difficult\nwork; the first day always was. The bridgemen were sloppy and uncertain.\nBut they also showed remarkable resolve. Kaladin had never worked\nwith a group who made fewer complaints. The bridgemen didn’t ask for a\nbreak. They didn’t shoot him resentful glances when he pushed them\nharder. The scowls they bore were at their own foibles, angry at themselves\nfor not learning faster.\nAnd they got it. After just a few hours, the more talented of them—\nMoash at the forefront—started to change into fighting men. Their stances\ngrew firmer, more confident. When they should have been feeling exhausted\nand frustrated, they were more determined.\nKaladin stepped back, watching Moash fall into his stance after Teft\nshoved him. It was a resetting exercise—Moash would let Teft knock him\nbackward, then would scramble back and set his feet. Time and time again.\nThe purpose was to train oneself to revert to the stance without thinking.\nKaladin normally wouldn’t have started resetting exercises until the second\nor third day. Yet here, Moash was drinking it in after only two hours. There\nwere two others—Drehy and Skar—who were nearly as quick to learn.\nKaladin leaned back against the stone wall. Cold water leaked down\nthe rock beside him, and a frillbloom plant hesitantly opened its fanlike\nfronds beside his head: two wide, orange leaves, with spines on the tips,\nunfolding like opening fists.\nIs it their bridgeman training? Kaladin wondered. Or is it their\npassion? He had given them a chance to fight back. That kind of\nopportunity changed a man.\nWatching them stand resolute and capable in stances they had only\nbeen just been taught, Kaladin realized something. These men—cast off by\nthe army, forced to work themselves near to death, then fed extra food\nby Kaladin’s careful planning—were the most fit, training-ready recruits\nhe’d ever been given.\nBy seeking to beat them down, Sadeas had prepared them to excel.\n“Flame and char.

Eyes like pits of blackness.”\n—A quote from the Iviad probably needs no reference notation, but\nthis comes from line 482, should I need to locate it quickly.\nShallan awoke in a small white room.\nShe sat up, feeling oddly healthy. Bright sunlight illuminated the\nwindow’s gossamer white shades, bursting through the cloth and into the\nroom. Shallan frowned, shaking her muddled head. She felt as if she should\nbe burned toes to ears, her skin flaking off. But that was just a memory. She\nhad the cut on her arm, but otherwise she felt perfectly well.\nA rustling sound. She turned to see a nurse hurrying away down a\nwhite hallway outside; the woman had apparently seen Shallan sit up, and\nwas now taking the news to someone.\nI’m in the hospital, Shallan thought. Moved to a private room.\nA soldier peeked in, inspecting Shallan. It was apparently a guarded\nroom.\n“What happened?” she called to him. “I was poisoned, wasn’t I?” She\nfelt a sudden shock of alarm. “Kabsal! Is he all right?”\nThe guard just turned back to his post. Shallan began to crawl out of\nbed, but he looked in again, glaring at her. She yelped despite herself,\npulling up the sheet and settling back. She still wore one of the hospital\nrobes, much like a soft bathing robe.\nHow long had she been unconscious? Why was she—\nThe Soulcaster! she realized. I gave it back to Jasnah.\nThe next half hour was one of the most miserable in Shallan’s life. She\nspent it suffering the periodic glares of the guard and feeling nauseated.\nWhat had happened?\nFinally, Jasnah appeared at the other end of the hallway. She was\nwearing a different dress, black with light grey piping. She strode toward\nthe room like an arrow and dismissed the guard with a single word as she\npassed. The man hurried away, his boots louder on the stone floor than\nJasnah’s slippers.\nJasnah came in, and though she made no accusations, her glare was so\nhostile that Shallan wanted to crawl under her covers and hide. No. She\nwanted to crawl under the bed, dig down into the floor itself, and put stone\nbetween herself and those eyes.\nShe settled for looking downward in shame.\n“You were wise to return the Soulcaster,” Jasnah said, voice like ice.\n“It saved your life. I saved your life.”\n“Thank you,” Shallan whispered.\n“Who are you working with? Which devotary bribed you to steal the\nfabrial?”\n“None of them, Brightness. I stole it of my own volition.”\n“Protecting them does you no good. Eventually you will tell me the\ntruth.”\n“It is the truth,” Shallan said, looking up, feeling a hint of defiance.\n“It’s why I became your ward in the first place. To steal that Soulcaster.”\n“Yes, but for whom?”\n“For me,” Shallan said. “Is it so hard to believe that I could act for\nmyself? Am I such a miserable failure that the only rational answer is to\nassume I was duped or manipulated?”\n“You have no grounds to raise your voice to me, child,” Jasnah said"

Finally, she sighed. “What were you\nthinking, child?”\n“My father is dead.”\n“So?”\n“He was not well liked, Brightness. Actually, he was hated, and our\nfamily is bankrupt. My brothers are trying to put up a strong front by\npretending he still lives. But…” Dared she tell Jasnah that her father had\npossessed a Soulcaster? Doing so wouldn’t help excuse what Shallan had\ndone, and might get her family more deeply into trouble. “We needed\nsomething. An edge. A way to earn money quickly, or create money.”\nJasnah was silent again. When she finally spoke, she sounded faintly\namused. “You thought your salvation lay in enraging not only all the entire\nardentia, but Alethkar? Do you realize what my brother would have done if\nhe’d learned of this?”\nShallan looked away, feeling both foolish and ashamed.\nJasnah sighed. “Sometimes I forget how young you are. I can see how\nthe theft might have looked tempting to you. It was stupid nonetheless. I’ve\narranged passage back to Jah Keved. You will leave in the morning.”\n“I—” It was more than she deserved. “Thank you.”\n“Your friend, the ardent, is dead.”\nShallan looked up, dismayed. “What happened?”\n“The bread was poisoned. Backbreaker powder. Very lethal, dusted\nover the bread to look like flour. I suspect the bread was similarly treated\nevery time he visited. His goal was to get me to eat a piece.”\n“But I ate a lot of that bread!”\n“The jam had the antidote,” Jasnah said. “We found it in several empty\njars he’d used.”\n“It can’t be!”\n“I’ve begun investigating,” Jasnah said. “I should have done so\nimmediately. Nobody quite remembers where this ‘Kabsal’ came from.\nThough he spoke familiarly of the other ardents to you and me, they knew\nhim only vaguely.”\n“Then he…”\n“He was playing you, child. The whole time, he was using you to get\nto me. To spy on what I was doing, to kill me if he could.” She spoke of it\nso evenly, so emotionlessly. “I believe he used much more of the powder\nduring this last attempt, more than he’d ever used before, perhaps hoping to\nget me to breathe it in. He realized this would be his last opportunity. It\nturned against him, however, working more quickly than he’d anticipated.”\nSomeone had almost killed her. Not someone, Kabsal. No wonder he’d\nbeen so eager to get her to taste the jam!\n“I’m very disappointed in you, Shallan,” Jasnah said. “I can see now\nwhy you tried to end your own life. It was the guilt.”\nShe hadn’t tried to kill herself. But what good would it do to admit\nthat? Jasnah was taking pity on her; best not to give her reason not to. But"

Behind Kaladin, the room had a thick red rug and shields on the\nwalls. There were a number of padded wooden chairs, like the one Kaladin\nsat in.

As a Shardbearer,\nKaladin would have been more important than Roshone—more important\nthan Amaram. He’d have been able to go to the Shattered Plains and fight in\na real war.\nNo more squabbling over borders. No more petty lighteyed captains\nbelonging to unimportant families, bitter because they’d been left behind.\nHe would never again have had to worry about blisters from boots that\ndidn’t fit, dinner slop that tasted of crem, or other soldiers who wanted to\npick a fight.\nHe could have been rich. He’d given it all away, just like that.\nAnd still, the mere thought of touching that Blade turned his stomach.\nHe didn’t want wealth, titles, armies, or even a good meal. He wanted to be\nable to go back and protect the men who had trusted him. Why had he\nchased after the Shardbearer? He should have run. But no, he’d insisted on\ncharging at a storming Shardbearer.\nYou protected your highmarshal, he told himself. You’re a hero.\nBut why was Amaram’s life worth more than those of his men?\nKaladin served Amaram because of the honor he had shown. He let\nspearmen share his comfort in the warcenter during highstorms, a different\nsquad each storm. He insisted that his men be well fed and well paid. He\ndidn’t treat them like slime.\nHe did let his subordinates do so, though. And he’d broken his promise\nto shelter Tien.\nSo did I. So did I….\nKaladin’s insides were a twisted mess of guilt and sorrow. One thing\nremained clear, like a bright spot of light on the wall of a dark room. He\nwanted nothing to do with those Shards. He didn’t even want to touch them.\nThe door thumped open, and Kaladin turned in his chair. Amaram\nentered. Tall, lean, with a square face and long martial coat of deep green.\nHe walked on a crutch. Kaladin eyed the wrappings and splint with a\ncritical eye. I could have done better. He’d also have insisted that the patient\nremain in bed.\nAmaram was talking to one of his stormwardens, a middle-aged man\nwith a square beard and robes of deep black.\n“…why Thaidakar would risk this?” Amaram was saying, speaking in\na soft voice. “But who else would it be? The Ghostbloods grow more bold.\nWe’ll need to find out who he was. Do we know anything about him?”\n“He was Veden, Brightlord,” the stormwarden said. “Nobody I\nrecognize. But I will investigate.”\nAmaram nodded, falling silent. Behind the two, a group of lighteyed\nofficers entered, one of them carrying the Shardblade, holding it on a pure\nwhite cloth. Behind this group came the four surviving members of\nKaladin’s squad: Hab, Reesh, Alabet, and Coreb.\nKaladin stood up, feeling exhausted. Amaram remained by the door,\narms folded, as two final men entered and closed the door. These last two"

These last two\nwere also lighteyes, but lesser ones—officers in Amaram’s personal guard.\nHad these been among those who had fled?\nIt was the smart thing to do, Kaladin thought. Smarter than what I did.\nAmaram leaned on his walking staff, inspecting Kaladin with bright\ntan eyes. He’d been in conference with his counselors for several hours\nnow, trying to discover who the Shardbearer had been. “You did a brave\nthing today, soldier,” Amaram said to Kaladin.\n“I…” What did you say to that? I wish I’d left you to die, sir. “Thank\nyou.”\n“Everyone else fled, including my honor guard.” The two men closest\nto the door looked down, ashamed. “But you charged in for the attack.\nWhy?”\n“I didn’t really think about it, sir.”\nAmaram seemed displeased by the answer. “Your name is Kaladin, is\nit?”\n“Yes, Brightlord. From Hearthstone? Remember?”\nAmaram frowned, looking confused.\n“Your cousin, Roshone, is citylord there. He sent my brother into the\narmy when you came recruiting. I…I joined with my brother.”\n“Ah yes,” Amaram said. “I believe I remember you.” He didn’t ask\nafter Tien. “You still haven’t answered my question. Why attack? It wasn’t\nfor the Shardblade. You rejected that.”\n“Yes, sir.”\nTo the side, the stormwarden raised his eyebrows, as if he hadn’t\nbelieved that Kaladin had turned down the Shards. The soldier holding the\nShardblade kept glancing at it in awe.\n“Why?” Amaram said. “Why did you reject it? I have to know.”\n“I don’t want it, sir.”\n“Yes, but why?”\nBecause it would make me one of you. Because I can’t look at that\nweapon and not see the faces of the men its wielder slaughtered so\noffhandedly.\nBecause…because…\n“I can’t really answer that, sir,” Kaladin said, sighing.\nThe stormwarden walked over to the room’s brazier, shaking his head.\nHe began warming his hands.\n“Look,” Kaladin said. “Those Shards are mine. Well, I said to give\nthem to Coreb. He’s the highest ranked of my soldiers, and the best fighter\namong them.” The other three would understand. Besides, Coreb would\ntake care of them, once he was a lighteyes.\nAmaram looked at Coreb, then nodded to his attendants. One closed\nthe window shutters. The others pulled out swords, then began moving\ntoward the four remaining members of Kaladin’s squad.\nKaladin yelled, leaping forward, but two of the officers had positioned\nthemselves close to him. One slammed a punch into Kaladin’s gut as soon\nas he started moving. He was so surprised that it connected directly, and he\ngasped.\nNo.\nHe fought off the pain, turning to swing at the man.

He had no weapons, and he was so tired from the\nbattle that he could barely stay upright. They knocked him to the ground\nwith punches to his side and back. He collapsed to the floor, pained, but still\nable to watch as the soldiers came at his men.\nReesh was cut down first. Kaladin gasped, stretching out a hand,\nstruggling to his knees.\nThis can’t happen. Please, no!\nHab and Alabet had their knives out, but fell quickly, one soldier\ngutting Hab as two others hacked down Alabet. Alabet’s knife thumped as it\nhit the ground, followed by his arm, then finally his corpse.\nCoreb lasted the longest, backing away, hands held forward. He didn’t\nscream. He seemed to understand. Kaladin’s eyes were watering, and\nsoldiers grabbed him from behind, stopping him from helping.\nCoreb’s fell to his knees and began to beg. One of Amaram’s men took\nhim at the neck, neatly severing his head. It was over in seconds.\n“You bastard!” Kaladin said, gasping against his pain. “You storming\nbastard!” Kaladin found himself weeping, struggling uselessly at the four\nmen holding him. The blood of the fallen spearmen soaked the boards.\nThey were dead. All of them were dead. Stormfather! All of them!\nAmaram stepped forward, expression grim. He went down on one\nknee before Kaladin. “I’m sorry.”\n“Bastard!” Kaladin screamed as loud as he could.\n“I couldn’t risk them telling what they saw. This is what must be,\nsoldier. It’s for the good of the army. They’re going to be told that your\nsquad helped the Shardbearer. You see, the men must believe that I killed\nhim.”\n“You’re taking the Shards for yourself!”\n“I am trained in the sword,” Amaram said, “and am accustomed to\nplate. It will serve Alethkar best if I bear the Shards.”\n“You could have asked me for them! Storm you!”\n“And when news got around camp?” Amaram said grimly. “That you’d\nkilled the Shardbearer but I had the Shards? Nobody would believe that\nyou’d given them up of your own free choice. Besides, son. You wouldn’t\nhave let me keep them.” Amaram shook his head. “You’d have changed\nyour mind. In a day or two, you’d have wanted the wealth and prestige—\nothers would convince you of it. You’d have demanded that I return them to\nyou. It took hours to decide, but Restares is right—this is what must be\ndone. For the good of Alethkar.”\n“It’s not about Alethkar! It’s about you! Storm it, you’re supposed to\nbe better than the others!” Tears dripped from Kaladin’s chin.\nAmaram looked guilty suddenly, as if he knew what Kaladin had said\nwas true. He turned away, waving to the stormwarden. The man turned\nfrom the brazier, holding something he’d been heating in the coals. A small\nbranding iron.\n“It’s all an act?” Kaladin asked. “The honorable brightlord who cares\nabout his men? Lies? All of it?”"

He took the Shardblade from the\ncloth, holding it in his hand. The gemstone at its pommel let out a flash of\nwhite light. “You can’t begin to understand the weights I carry, spearman.”\nAmaram’s voice lost some of its calm tone of reason. He sounded\ndefensive. “I can’t worry about the lives of a few darkeyed spearmen when\nthousands of people may be saved by my decision.”\nThe stormwarden stepped up to Kaladin, positioning the branding iron.\nThe glyphs, reversed, read sas nahn. A slave’s brand.\n“You came for me,” Amaram said, limping to the door, stepping\naround Reesh’s body. “For saving my life, I spare yours. Five men telling\nthe same story would have been believed, but a single slave will be ignored.\nThe warcamp will be told that you didn’t try to help your fellows—but you\ndidn’t try to stop them, either. You fled and were captured by my guard.”\nAmaram hesitated by the door, resting the blunt edge of the stolen\nShardblade on his shoulder. The guilt was still there in his eyes, but he grew\nhard, covering it. “You are being discharged as a deserter and branded as a\nslave. But you are spared death by my mercy.”\nHe opened the door and walked out.\nThe branding iron fell, searing Kaladin’s fate into his skin. He let out a\nfinal, ragged scream.\nTHE END OF\nPart Three\nBaxil hastened down the lavish palace corridor, clutching the bulky bag of\ntools. A sound like a footfall came from behind him and he jumped,\nspinning. He didn’t see anything. The corridor was empty, a golden carpet\nlining the floor, mirrors on the walls, arched ceiling inlaid with elaborate\nmosaics.\n“Would you stop that?” Av said, walking beside him. “Every time you\njump I nearly cuff you one out of surprise.”\n“I can’t help it,” Baxil said. “Shouldn’t we be doing this at night?”\n“Mistress knows what she’s doing,” Av said. Like Baxil, Av was\nEmuli, with dark skin and hair. But the taller man was far more self-\nconfident. He sauntered down the halls, acting as if they’d been invited,\nthick-bladed sword slung in a sheath over his shoulder.\nIf the Prime Kadasix may provide, Baxil thought, I’d rather Av never\nhave to draw that weapon. Thank you.\nTheir mistress walked ahead of them, the only other person in the\nhallway. She wasn’t Emuli–she didn’t even seem Makabaki, though she had\ndark skin and long, beautiful black hair. She had eyes like a Shin, but she\nwas tall and lean, like an Alethi. Av thought she was a mixed breed. Or so\nhe said when they dared talk about such things. The mistress had good ears.\nStrangely good ears.\nShe stopped at the next intersection. Baxil caught himself glancing\nover his shoulder again. Av elbowed him, but he couldn’t help looking. Yes,"

Yes,\nthe mistress claimed that the palace servants would be busy getting the new\nguest wing ready, but this was the home of Ashno of Sages himself. One of\nthe richest and holiest men in all of Emul. He had hundreds of servants.\nWhat if one of them walked down this hallway?\nThe two men joined their mistress at the intersection. He forced his\neyes forward so he wouldn’t keep looking over his shoulder, but then found\nhimself staring at the mistress. It was dangerous, being employed by a\nwoman as beautiful as she was, with that long black hair, worn free,\nhanging down to her waist. She never wore a proper woman’s robe, or even\na dress or skirt. Always trousers, usually sleek and tight, a thin-bladed\nsword at her hip. Her eyes were so faintly violet they were almost white.\nShe was amazing. Wonderful, intoxicating, overwhelming.\nAv elbowed him in the ribs again. Baxil jumped, then glared at his\ncousin, rubbing his belly.\n“Baxil,” the mistress said. “My tools.”\nHe opened the bag, handing over a folded tool belt. It clinked as she\ntook it, not looking at him, then she strode down the hallway to their left.\nBaxil watched, uncomfortable. This was the Hallowed Hall, the place\nwhere a wealthy man placed images of his Kadasix for reverence. The\nmistress walked up to the first piece of art. The painting depicted Epan,\nLady of Dreams. It was beautiful, a masterpiece of gold leaf on black\ncanvas.\nThe mistress took a knife from her bundle and slashed the painting\ndown the front. Baxil cringed, but said nothing. He’d almost gotten used to\nthe casual way she destroyed art, though he was baffled by it. She did pay\nthe two of them very well, however.\nAv leaned back against the wall, picking his teeth with a fingernail.\nBaxil tried to imitate his relaxed pose. The large hallway was lit with topaz\nchips set in beautiful chandeliers, but they made no move to take them. The\nmistress did not approve of stealing.\n“I’ve been thinking of seeking the Old Magic,” Baxil said, partially to\nkeep himself from cringing as the mistress moved on to gouge out the eyes\nof a fine bust.\nAv snorted. “Why?”\n“I don’t know,” Baxil said. “Seems like something to do with myself.\nI’ve never sought it, you know, and they say every man gets one chance.\nAsk a boon of the Nightwatcher. Have you used yours?”\n“Nah,” Av said. “Don’t fancy making the trip all the way to the Valley.\nBesides, my brother went. Came back with two numb hands. Never could\nfeel anything with them again.”\n“What was his boon?” Baxil asked as the mistress wrapped up a vase\nwith a cloth, then quietly shattered it on the floor and crushed the pieces.\n“Don’t know,” Av said. “He never said. Seemed embarrassed. Probably\nasked for something silly, like a good haircut.” Av smirked."

Probably\nasked for something silly, like a good haircut.” Av smirked.\n“I was thinking I’d make myself more useful,” Baxil said. “Ask for\ncourage, you know?”\n“If you want,” Av replied. “I figure there are better ways than the Old\nMagic. You never know what kind of curse you’ll end up with.”\n“I could phrase my request perfectly,” Baxil said.\n“Doesn’t work that way,” Av said. “It’s not a game, no matter how the\nstories try to put it. The Nightwatcher doesn’t trick you or twist your words.\nYou ask a boon. She gives what she feels you deserve, then gives you a\ncurse to go along with it. Sometimes related, sometimes not.”\n“And you’re an expert?” Baxil asked. The mistress was slashing\nanother painting. “I thought you said you never went.”\n“I didn’t,” Av said. “On account of my father going, my mother going,\nand each of my brothers going. A few got what they wanted. Most all of\nthem regretted the curse, save my father. He got a heap of good cloth; sold\nto keep us from starving during the lurnip famine a few decades ago.”\n“What was his curse?” Baxil said.\n“Saw the world upside down from then on.”\n“Really?”\n“Yeah,” Av said. “Twisted all about. Like people walk on the ceilings\nand the sky was underneath him. Said he got used to it pretty quickly,\nthough, and didn’t really think it a curse by the time he died.”\nEven thinking about that curse made Baxil feel sick. He looked down\nat his sack of tools. If he weren’t such a coward, would he–maybe–be able\nto convince the mistress to see him as something more than just hired\nmuscle?\nIf the Prime Kadasix could provide, he thought, it would be very nice if\nI could know the right thing to do. Thank you.\nThe mistress returned, hair somewhat disheveled. She held out a hand.\n“Padded mallet, Baxil. There’s a full statue back there.”\nHe responded, pulling the mallet out of the sack and handing it to her.\n“Perhaps I should get myself a Shardblade,” she said absently, putting\nthe tool up on her shoulder. “But that might make this too easy.”\n“I wouldn’t mind if it were too easy, mistress,” Baxil noted.\nShe sniffed, walking back down the hallway. Soon she began to pound\non a statue at the far end, breaking off its arms. Baxil winced. “Someone’s\ngoing to hear that.”\n“Yeah,” Av said. “Probably why she waited to do it last.”\nAt least the pounding was muffled by the padding. They had to be the\nonly thieves who sneaked into the homes of rich men without taking\nanything.\n“Why does she do this, Av?” Baxil found himself asking.\n“Don’t know. Maybe you should ask her.”\n“I thought you said I should never do that!”\n“Depends,” Av said. “How attached to your limbs are you?”\n“Rather attached.”\n“Well, if you ever want that changed, start asking the mistress prying\nquestions. Until then, shut up.”"

Until then, shut up.”\nBaxil said nothing further. The Old Magic, he thought. It could change\nme. I will go looking for it.\nKnowing his luck, though, he wouldn’t be able to find it. He sighed,\nresting back against the wall as muted thuds continued to come from the\nmistress’s direction.\n“I’m thinking of changing my Calling,” Ashir said from behind.\nGeranid nodded absently as she worked on her equations. The small\nstone room smelled sharply of spices. Ashir was trying another new\nexperiment. It involved some kind of curry powder and a rare Shin fruit that\nhe’d caramelized. Something like that. She could hear it sizzling on his new\nfabrial hotplate.\n“I’m tired of cooking,” Ashir continued. He had a soft, kindly voice.\nShe loved him for that. Partially because he liked to talk–and if you were\ngoing to have someone talk while you were attempting to think, they might\nas well have a soft, kindly voice.\n“I don’t have passion for it as I once did,” he continued. “Besides,\nwhat good will a cook be in the Spiritual Realm?”\n“Heralds need food,” she said absently, scratching out a line on her\nwriting board, then scribbling another line of numbers beneath it.\n“Do they?” Ashir asked. “I’ve never been convinced. Oh, I’ve read the\nspeculations, but it just doesn’t seem rational to me. The body must be fed\nin the Physical Realm, but the spirit exists in a completely different state.”\n“A state of ideals,” she replied. “So, you could create ideal foods,\nperhaps.”\n“Hmm…What would be the fun in that? No experimentation.”\n“I could do without,” she said, leaning forward to inspect the room’s\nhearth, where two flamespren danced on the logs’ fire. “If it meant never\nagain having to eat something like that green soup you made last month.”\n“Ah,” he said, sounding wistful. “That was something, wasn’t it?\nCompletely revolting, yet made entirely from appetizing ingredients.” He\nseemed to consider it a personal triumph. “I wonder if they eat in the\nCognitive Realm. Is a food there what it sees itself as being? I’ll have to\nread and see if anyone has ever eaten while visiting Shadesmar.”\nGeranid responded with a noncommittal grunt, getting out her calipers\nand leaning closer to the heat to measure the flamespren. She frowned, then\nmade another notation.\n“Here, love,” Ashir said, walking over, then knelt beside her and\noffered a small bowl. “Give this a try. I think you’ll like it.”\nShe eyed the contents. Bits of bread covered with a red sauce. It was\nmen’s food, but they were both ardents, so that didn’t matter.\nFrom outside came the sounds of waves gently lapping against the\nrocks. They were on a tiny Reshi island, technically sent to provide for the\nreligious needs of any Vorin visitors. Some travelers did come to them for\nthat, occasionally even some of the Reshi.

But really, this was a way of\ngetting away and focusing on their experiments. Geranid with her spren\nstudies. Ashir with his chemistry–through cooking, of course, as it allowed\nhim to eat the results.\nThe portly man smiled affably, head shaven, grey beard neatly squared\noff. They both kept to the rules of their stations, despite their seclusion. One\ndid not write the ending of a lifetime of faith with a sloppy last chapter.\n“No green,” she noted, taking the bowl. “That’s a good sign.”\n“Hmmm,” he said, leaning down and adjusting his spectacles to\ninspect her notations. “Yes. It really was fascinating the way that Shin\nvegetable caramelized. I’m so pleased that Gom brought it to me. You’ll\nhave to go over my notes. I think I got the figures right, but I could be\nwrong.” He wasn’t as strong at mathematics as he was at theory.\nConveniently, Geranid was just the opposite.\nShe took a spoon and tried the food. She didn’t wear a sleeve on her\nsafehand–another one of the advantages of being an ardent. The food was\nactually quite good. “Did you try this, Ashir?”\n“Nope,” he said, still looking over her figures. “You’re the brave one,\nmy dear.”\nShe sniffed. “It’s terrible.”\n“I can see that from how you’re taking another large bite at this\nmoment.”\n“Yes, but you’d hate it. No fruit. Is this fish you added?”\n“A dried handful of the little minnows I caught outside this morning.\nStill don’t know what species they are. Tasty, though.” He hesitated, then\nlooked up at the hearth and its spren. “Geranid, what is this?”\n“I think I’ve had a breakthrough,” she said softly.\n“But the figures,” he said, tapping the writing board. “You said they\nwere erratic, and they still are.”\n“Yes,” she said, narrowing her eyes at the flamespren. “But I can\npredict when they will be erratic and when they won’t be.”\nHe looked at her, frowning.\n“The spren change when I measure them, Ashir,” she said. “Before I\nmeasure, they dance and vary in size, luminosity, and shape. But when I\nmake a notation, they immediately freeze in their current state. Then they\nremain that way permanently, so far as I can tell.”\n“What does it mean?” he asked.\n“I’m hoping you’ll be able to tell me. I have the figures. You’ve got the\nimagination, dear one.”\nHe scratched at his beard, sitting back, and produced a bowl and spoon\nfor himself. He’d sprinkled dried fruit over his portion; Geranid was half\nconvinced he’d joined the ardentia because of his sweet tooth. “What\nhappens if you erase the figures?” he asked.\n“The spren go back to being variable,” she said. “Length, shape,\nluminosity.”\nHe took a bite of his mush. “Go into the other room.”\n“What?”\n“Just do it. Take your writing board.”\nShe sighed, standing up, joints popping. Was she getting that old?"

Was she getting that old?\nStarlight, but they’d spent a long time out on this island. She walked to the\nother room, where their cot was.\n“What now?” she called.\n“I’m going to measure the spren with your calipers,” he called back.\n“I’ll take three measurements in a row. Only write down one of the figures I\ngive you. Don’t tell me which one you’re writing down.”\n“All right,” she called back. The window was open, and she looked out\nover a darkening, glassy expanse of water. The Reshi Sea wasn’t as shallow\nas the Purelake, but it was quite warm most of the time, dotted with tropical\nislands and the occasional monster of a greatshell.\n“Three inches, seven tenths,” Ashir called.\nShe didn’t write down the figure.\n“Two inches, eight tenths.”\nShe ignored the number this time too, but got her chalk ready to write\n—as quietly as possible—the next numbers he called out.\n“Two inches, three ten—Wow.”\n“What?” she called.\n“It stopped changing sizes. I assume you wrote down that third\nnumber?”\nShe frowned, walking back into their small living chamber. Ashir’s\nhotplate sat on a low table to her right. After the Reshi style, there were no\nchairs, just cushions, and all the furniture was flat and long, rather than tall.\nShe approached the hearth. One of the two flamespren danced about\natop a log, shape changing and length flickering like the flames themselves.\nThe other had taken on a far more stable shape. Its length no longer\nchanged, though its form did slightly.\nIt seemed locked somehow. It almost looked like a little person as it\ndanced over the fire. She reached up and erased her notation. It immediately\nbegan pulsing and changing erratically like the other one.\n“Wow,” Ashir repeated. “It’s as if it knows, somehow, that it has been\nmeasured. As if merely defining its form traps it somehow. Write down a\nnumber.”\n“What number?”\n“Any number,” he said. “But one that might be the size of a\nflamespren.”\nShe did so. Nothing happened.\n“You have to actually measure it,” he said, tapping his spoon softly\nagainst the side of his bowl. “No pretending.”\n“I wonder at the precision of the instrument,” she said. “If I use one\nthat is less precise, will that give the spren more flexibility? Or is there a\nthreshold, an accuracy beyond which it finds itself bound?” She sat down,\nfeeling daunted. “I need to research this more. Try it for luminosity, then\ncompare that to my general equation of flamespren luminosity as compared\nto the fire they’re drawn to dance around.”\nAshir grimaced. “That, my dear, sounds a lot like math.”\n“Indeed.”\n“Then I shall make you a snack to occupy you while you create new\nmarvels of calculation and genius.” He smiled, kissing her forehead. “You\njust found something wonderful,” he said more softly. “I don’t know what it\nmeans yet, but it might very well change everything we understand about"

And for once, she didn’t\nmind at all as he began chatting about his ingredients, working out a new\nformula for some sugary confection he was sure she’d love.\nSzeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, spun between the two guards\nas their eyes burned out. They slumped quietly to the floor.\nWith three quick strokes, he slashed his Shardblade through the hinges\nand latch of the grand door. Then he took a deep breath, absorbing the\nStormlight from a pouch of gemstones at his waist. He burst alight with\nrenewed power and kicked the door with the force of a Light-enhanced foot.\nIt flew backward into the room, hinges no longer holding it in place,\nthen crashed to the floor, skidding on the stone. The large feast hall inside\nwas filled with people, crackling hearths, and clattering plates. The heavy\ndoor slid to a halt, and the room grew quiet.\nI am sorry, he thought. Then he dashed in to start the slaughter.\nChaos ensued. Screams, yells, panic. Szeth leaped atop the nearest\ndining table and started spinning, cutting down everyone nearby. As he did\nso, he made certain to listen to the sounds of the dying. He did not shut his\nears to the screams. He did not ignore the wails of pain. He paid attention to\neach and every one.\nAnd hated himself.\nHe moved forward, leaping from table to table, wielding his\nShardblade, a god of burning Stormlight and death.\n“Armsmen!” yelled the lighteyed man at the edge of the room. “Where\nare my armsmen!” Thick of waist and shoulder, the man had a square\nbrown beard and a prominent nose. King Hanavanar of Jah Keved. Not a\nShardbearer, though some rumors said that he secretly kept a Shardblade.\nNear Szeth, men and women scrambled away, stumbling over one\nanother. He dropped among them, his white clothing rippling. He cut\nthrough a man who was drawing his sword–but also sliced through three\nwomen who wanted only to escape. Eyes burned and bodies collapsed.\nSzeth reached behind himself, infusing the table he’d leaped from,\nthen Lashing it to the far wall with a Basic Lashing, the type that changed\nwhich direction was down. The large wooden table fell to the side, tumbling\ninto people, causing more screams and more pain.\nSzeth found himself crying. His orders were simple. Kill. Kill as you\nhave never killed before. Lay the innocent screaming at your feet and make\nthe lighteyes weep. Do so wearing white, so all know who you are. Szeth\ndid not object. It was not his place. He was Truthless.\nAnd he did as his masters demanded.\nThree lighteyed men got up the nerve to attack him, and Szeth raised\nhis Shardblade in salute. They screamed battle cries as they charged.

The\nlength of metal spun in the air as Szeth stepped between the other two, his\nBlade swishing through their necks. They dropped in tandem, eyes\nshriveling. Szeth struck the first man from behind, ramming the Blade\nthrough his back and out his chest.\nThe man dropped forward–a hole in his shirt, but his skin unmarred.\nAs he hit the floor, his severed sword blade clanged to the stones beside\nhim.\nAnother group came at Szeth from the side, and he drew Stormlight\ninto his hand and flung it in a Full Lashing across the floor at their feet. This\nwas the Lashing that bonded objects; when the men crossed it, their shoes\nstuck to the floor. They tripped, and found their hands and bodies Lashed to\nthe floor as well. Szeth stepped through them mournfully, striking.\nThe king edged away, as if to round the chamber and escape. Szeth\nsprayed a table’s top with a Full Lashing, then infused the entire thing with\na Basic Lashing as well, pointed at the doorway. The table flipped into the\nair and crashed against the exit–the side bearing the Full Lashing sticking it\nto the wall. People tried to pry it out of the way, but that only made them\nbunch up as Szeth waded into them, Shardblade sweeping.\nSo many deaths. Why? What purpose did it fulfill?\nWhen he’d assaulted Alethkar six years before, he’d thought that had\nbeen a massacre. He hadn’t known what a true massacre was. He reached\nthe door and found himself standing over the bodies of some thirty people,\nhis emotions caught up in the tempest of Stormlight within him. He hated\nthat Stormlight, suddenly, as much as he hated himself. As much as the\ncursed Blade he held.\nAnd…and the king. Szeth spun on the man. Irrationally, his confused,\nbroken mind blamed this man. Why had he called a feast on this night?\nWhy couldn’t he have retired early? Why had he invited so many people?\nSzeth charged at the king. He passed the dead, who lay twisted on the\nfloor, burned-out eyes staring in lifeless accusation. The king cowered\nbehind his high table.\nThat high table shuddered, quivering oddly.\nSomething was wrong.\nInstinctively, Szeth Lashed himself to the ceiling. From his viewpoint,\nthe room flipped, and the floor was now the ceiling. Two figures burst out\nfrom beneath the king’s table. Two men in Plate, carrying Shardblades,\nswinging.\nTwisting in the air, Szeth evaded their swings, then Lashed himself\nback to the floor, landing on the king’s table just as the king summoned a\nShardblade. So the rumors were true.\nThe king struck, but Szeth jumped backward, landing beyond the\nShardbearers. Outside, he could hear footfalls. Szeth glanced to see men\npouring into the room. The newcomers carried distinctive, diamond-shaped\nshields. Half-shards. Szeth had heard of the new fabrials, capable of\nstopping a Shardblade.\n“You think I didn’t know you were coming?” the king yelled at him."

Szeth had heard of the new fabrials, capable of\nstopping a Shardblade.\n“You think I didn’t know you were coming?” the king yelled at him.\n“After you killed three of my highprinces? We’re ready for you, assassin.”\nHe lifted something from beneath the table. Another of those half-shard\nshields. They were made of metal imbedded with a gemstone hidden at the\nback.\n“You are a fool,” Szeth said, Stormlight leaking from his mouth.\n“Why?” the king called. “You think I should have run?”\n“No,” Szeth replied, meeting his eyes. “Because you set a trap for me\nduring a feast. And now I can blame you for their deaths.”\nThe soldiers fanned out through the room while the two fully armored\nShardbearers stepped toward him, Blades out. The king smiled.\n“So let it be,” Szeth said, breathing deeply, sucking in the Stormlight\nof the many gemstones tied in the pouches at his waist. The Light began to\nrage within him, like a highstorm in his chest, burning and screaming. He\nbreathed in more than he’d ever held before, holding it until he was barely\nable to keep the Stormlight from ripping him apart.\nWere those still tears in his eyes? Would that they could hide his\ncrimes. He yanked the strap free at his waist, releasing his belt and the\nheavy spheres.\nThen he dropped his Shardblade.\nHis opponents froze in shock as his Blade vanished to mist. Who\nwould drop a Shardblade in the middle of a battle? It defied reason.\nAnd so did Szeth.\nYou are a work of art, Szeth-son-Neturo. A god.\nIt was time to see.\nThe soldiers and Shardbearers charged. Mere heartbeats before they\nreached him, Szeth spun into motion, liquid tempest in his veins. He dodged\nbetween the initial sword strikes, spinning into the midst of the soldiers.\nHolding this much Stormlight made it easier to infuse things; the light\nwanted out, and it pushed against his skin. In this state, the Shardblade\nwould only be a distraction. Szeth himself was the real weapon.\nHe grabbed the arm of an attacking soldier. It took only an instant to\ninfuse and Lash him upward. The man cried out, falling into the air as Szeth\nducked another sword thrust. He touched the attacker’s leg, inhumanly\nlithe. With a look and a blink, he Lashed that man to the ceiling as well.\nSoldiers cursed, slashing at him, their bulky half-shards suddenly\nbecoming hindrances as Szeth moved among them, graceful as a skyeel,\ntouching arms, legs, shoulders, sending a dozen, then two dozen, men flying\nin all directions. Most went up, but he sent a barrage of them toward the\napproaching Shardbearers, who cried out as squirming bodies smashed into\nthem.\nHe jumped backward as a squad of soldiers came at him, Lashing\nhimself to the far wall and spinning into the air. The room changed\norientations, and he landed on the wall–which was now down for him. He\nran along it toward the king, who waited behind his Shardbearers.\n“Kill him!” the king said. “Storm you all! What are you doing? Kill"

Kill\nhim!”\nSzeth leaped off the wall, Lashing himself downward as he flipped,\nlanding with one knee on the dining table. Silverware and plates clinked as\nhe grabbed a dining knife and infused once, twice, three times. He used a\ntriple Basic Lashing, pointing it in the direction of the king, then dropped it\nand Lashed himself backward.\nHe lurched away as one of the Shardbearers struck, cutting the table in\nhalf. Szeth’s released knife fell far more quickly than it should have,\nflashing toward the king. He barely got his shield up in time, eyes wide as\nthe knife clanged against the metal.\nDamnation, Szeth thought, Lashing himself upward with a quarter of a\nBasic Lashing. That didn’t pull him upward, it just made him much lighter.\nA quarter of his weight was now pulled upward instead of downward. In\nessence, he became half as heavy as he had been.\nHe twisted, white clothing flapping gracefully as he dropped amid the\ncommon soldiers. Soldiers he’d Lashed earlier began to fall from the high\nceiling, their Stormlight running out. A rain of broken bodies, crashing one\nby one to the floor.\nSzeth came at the soldiers again. Some men fell as he sent others\nflying. Their expensive shields clanged to the stones, falling from dead or\nstunned fingers. Soldiers tried to reach him, but Szeth danced between\nthem, using the ancient martial art of kammar, which used only the hands. It\nwas meant as a less deadly form of fighting, focused on grabbing enemies\nand using their weight against them, immobilizing them.\nIt was also ideal when one wanted to touch and infuse someone.\nHe was the storm. He was destruction. At his will, men flipped into the\nair, fell, and died. He swept outward, touching a table and Lashing it\nupward with half a Basic Lashing. With half its mass pulled upward, half\ndownward, it became weightless. Szeth sprayed it with a Full Lashing, then\nkicked it toward the soldiers; they stuck to it, their clothing and skin\nbonding to the wood.\nA Shardblade hissed through the air beside him, and Szeth exhaled\nlightly, Stormlight rising from his lips as he ducked out of the way. The two\nShardbearers attacked as bodies fell from above, but Szeth was too quick,\ntoo limber. The Shardbearers didn’t work together. They were accustomed\nto dominating a battlefield or dueling with a single enemy. Their powerful\nweapons made them sloppy.\nSzeth ran on light feet, held to the ground only half as much as other\nmen. He easily leaped another swipe, Lashing himself to the ceiling to give\nhimself just a little more lift before quarter-Lashing to make himself\nweighted down again. The result was an effortless leap of ten feet into the\nair.\nThe missed swing hit the ground and cut through the belt he’d dropped\nearlier, opening one of his large pouches. Spheres and bare gemstones\nsprayed across the floor. Some infused. Some dun. Szeth pulled Stormlight\nfrom those that rolled close.\nBehind the Shardbearers, the king himself approached, weapon ready."

Szeth pulled Stormlight\nfrom those that rolled close.\nBehind the Shardbearers, the king himself approached, weapon ready.\nHe should have tried to run.\nThe two Shardbearers swung their oversized Blades at Szeth. He spun\naway from the attacks, reaching out and snatching a shield from the air as it\ntumbled toward the ground. The man who had been holding it crashed to\nthe floor a second later.\nSzeth leaped at one of the Shardbearers–a man in gold armor–\ndeflecting his weapon with the shield and pushing past him. The other man,\nwhose Plate was red, swung too. Szeth caught the Blade on his shield,\nwhich cracked, barely holding. Still pushing it against the Blade, Szeth\nLashed himself behind the Shardbearer while jumping forward.\nThe move flipped Szeth up and over the man. Szeth went on, falling\ntoward the far wall as the second wave of soldiers began to drop to the\nfloor. One crashed into the Shardbearer in red, making him stumble.\nSzeth hit the wall, landing against the stones. He was so full of\nStormlight. So much power, so much life, so much terrible, terrible\ndestruction.\nStone. It was sacred. He never thought about that anymore. How could\nanything be sacred to him, now?\nAs bodies crashed into the Shardbearers, he knelt and placed his hand\non a large stone in the wall before him, infusing it. He Lashed it time and\ntime again in the direction of the Shardbearers. Once, twice, ten times,\nfifteen times. He kept pouring Stormlight into it. It glowed brightly. Mortar\ncracked. Stone ground against stone.\nThe red Shardbearer turned just as the massive, infused rock fell\ntoward him, moving with twenty times the normal acceleration of a falling\nstone. It crashed into him, shattering his breastplate, spraying molten bits in\nall directions. The block hurled him across the room, crushing him against\nthe far wall. He did not move.\nSzeth was nearly out of Stormlight now. He quarter-Lashed himself to\nreduce his weight, then loped across the ground. Men were crushed, broken,\ndead around him. Spheres rolled on the floor, and he drew in their\nStormlight. The Light streamed up, like the souls of those he had killed,\ninfusing him.\nHe began to run. The other Shardbearer stumbled backward, holding\nup his Blade, stepping onto the wood of a shattered tabletop, the legs of\nwhich had broken free. The king finally realized his trap was failing. He\nstarted to flee.\nTen heartbeats, Szeth thought. Return to me, you creation of\nDamnation.\nSzeth’s heartbeats began to thump in his ears. He screamed–Light\nbursting from his mouth like radiant smoke–and threw himself to the\nground as the Shardbearer swung. Szeth Lashed himself toward the far wall,\nskidding through the Shardbearer’s legs. He immediately Lashed himself\nupward.\nHe soared into the air as the Shardbearer rounded on him again. But\nSzeth wasn’t there. He Lashed himself back downward, dropping behind\nthe Shardbearer to land on the broken tabletop. He stooped and infused it.

A\nman in Shardplate might be protected from Lashings, but the things he\nstood upon were not.\nSzeth Lashed the plank upward with a multiple Lashing. It lurched into\nthe air, tossing aside the Shardbearer like a toy soldier. Szeth himself stayed\natop the board, riding it upward in a rush of air. As it reached the lofty\nceiling he threw himself off, Lashing himself downward once, twice, three\ntimes.\nThe tabletop crashed to the ceiling. Szeth fell with incredible speed\ntoward the Shardbearer, who lay dazed on his back.\nSzeth’s Blade formed in his fingers just as he hit, driving the weapon\ndown through Shardplate. The breastplate exploded and the Blade sank\ndeeply through the man’s chest and into the floor underneath.\nSzeth stood, pulling his Shardblade free. The fleeing king looked over\nhis shoulder with a cry of disbelieving horror. Both of his Shardbearers had\nfallen in a matter of seconds. The last of the soldiers nervously moved in to\nprotect his retreat.\nSzeth had stopped crying. It seemed like he couldn’t cry any longer.\nHe felt numb. His mind…it just couldn’t think. He hated the king. Hated\nhim so badly. And it hurt, physically hurt him, how strong that irrational\nhatred was.\nStormlight rising from him, he Lashed himself toward the king.\nHe fell, feet just above the ground, as if he were floating. His clothing\nrippled. To those guards still alive, he would seem to be gliding across the\nground.\nHe Lashed himself downward at a slight angle and began to swing his\nBlade as he reached the ranks of the soldiers. He ran through them as if he\nwere moving down a steep slope. Swirling and spinning, he dropped a\ndozen men, graceful and terrible, drawing in more Stormlight from spheres\nthat had been scattered on the floor.\nSzeth reached the doorway, men with burning eyes falling to the\nground behind him. Just outside, the king ran amid a final small group of\nguards. He turned and cried out as he saw Szeth, then threw up his half-\nshard shield.\nSzeth wove through the guards, then hit the shield twice, shattering it\nand forcing the king backward. The man tripped, dropping his Blade. It\npuffed away to mist.\nSzeth leaped up and Lashed himself downward with a double Basic\nLashing. He hit atop the king, his increased weight breaking an arm and\npinning the man to the ground. Szeth swept his blade through the surprised\nsoldiers, who fell as their legs died beneath them.\nFinally, Szeth raised his Blade over his head, looking down at the king.\n“What are you?” the man whispered, eyes watering with pain.\n“Death,” Szeth said, then drove his Blade point-first through the man’s\nface and into the rock below.\n“I’m standing over the body of a brother. I’m weeping. Is that his\nblood or mine? What have we done?”\n—Dated Vevanev, 1173, 107 seconds pre-death.

Renarin stood beside the hearth,\ninspecting the new fabrial that had been installed there just a few days ago.\nThe infused ruby, encased in a metal enclosure, glowed softly and gave off\na comfortable heat. It was convenient, though it felt wrong to Adolin that no\nfire lay crackling there.\nThe three were alone in Dalinar’s sitting room, awaiting the advent of\nthe day’s highstorm. It had been one week since Dalinar had informed his\nsons of his intention to step down as highprince.\nAdolin’s father sat in one of his large, high-backed chairs, hands laced\nbefore him, stoic. The warcamps didn’t know of his decision yet—bless the\nHeralds—but he intended to make the announcement soon. Perhaps at\ntonight’s feast.\n“All right, fine,” Adolin said. “Perhaps I said it. But I didn’t mean it.\nOr at least I didn’t mean for it to have this effect on you.”\n“We had this discussion a week ago, Adolin,” Dalinar said softly.\n“Yes, and you promised to think over your decision!”\n“I have. My resolve has not wavered.”\nAdolin continued to pace; Renarin stood up straight, watching him as\nhe stalked past. I’m a fool, Adolin thought. Of course this is what Father\nwould do. I should have seen it.\n“Look,” Adolin said, “just because you might have some problems\ndoesn’t mean you have to abdicate.”\n“Adolin, our enemies will use my weakness against us. In fact, you\nbelieve that they are already doing so. If I don’t give up the princedom now,\nmatters could grow much worse than they are now.”\n“But I don’t want to be highprince,” Adolin complained. “Not yet, at\nleast.”\n“Leadership is rarely about what we want, son. I think too few among\nthe Alethi elite realize that fact.”\n“And what will happen to you?” Adolin asked, pained. He stopped and\nlooked toward his father.\nDalinar was so firm, even sitting there, contemplating his own\nmadness. Hands clasped before him, wearing a stiff blue uniform with a\ncoat of Kholin blue, silver hair dusting his temples. Those hands of his were\nthick and callused, his expression determined. Dalinar made a decision and\nstuck to it, not wavering or debating.\nMad or not, he was what Alethkar needed. And Adolin had—in his\nhaste—done what no warrior on the battlefield had ever been able to do:\nchop Dalinar Kholin’s legs out from under him and send him away in\ndefeat.\nOh, Stormfather, Adolin thought, stomach twisting in pain.

Could I…but no, I could not give them up.”\n“Of course not!” Adolin said, aghast. A Shardbearer, giving up his\nShards? It almost never happened unless the Bearer was too weak and\nsickly to use them.\nDalinar nodded. “I have long worried that our homeland is in danger,\nnow that every single Shardbearer fights out here on the Plains. Well,\nperhaps this change of winds is a blessing. I will return to Kholinar and aid\nthe queen, make myself useful fighting against border incursions. Perhaps\nthe Reshi and the Vedens will be less likely to strike against us if they know\nthat they’d be facing a full Shardbearer.”\n“That’s possible,” Adolin said. “But they could also escalate and start\nsending a Shardbearer of their own on raids.”\nThat seemed to worry his father. Jah Keved was the only other\nkingdom in Roshar that owned a substantial number of Shards, nearly as\nmany as Alethkar. There hadn’t been a direct war between them in\ncenturies. Alethkar had been too divided, and Jah Keved was little better.\nBut if the two kingdoms clashed in force, it would be a war the like of\nwhich hadn’t been seen since the days of the Hierocracy.\nDistant thunder rumbled outside, and Adolin turned sharply toward\nDalinar. His father remained in his chair, staring westward, away from the\nstorm. “We will continue this discussion afterward,” Dalinar said. “For now,\nyou two should tie my arms to the chair.”\nAdolin grimaced, but did as he was told without complaint.\nDalinar blinked, looking around. He was on the battlement of a single-\nwalled fortress. Crafted from large blocks of deep red stone, the wall was\nsheer and straight. It was built across a rift in the leeward side of a tall rock\nformation overlooking an open plain of stone, like a wet leaf stuck across a\ncrack in a boulder.\nThese visions feel so real, Dalinar thought, glancing at the spear he\nheld in his hand and then down at his antiquated uniform: a cloth skirt and\nleather jerkin. It was hard to remember that he was really sitting in his chair,\narms tied down. He couldn’t feel the ropes or hear the highstorm.\nHe considered waiting out the vision, doing nothing. If this wasn’t real,\nwhy should he participate? Yet he didn’t completely believe—couldn’t\ncompletely believe—that he was coming up with these delusions on his\nown. His decision to abdicate to Adolin was motivated by his doubts. Was\nhe mad? Was he misinterpreting? At the very least, he could no longer trust\nhimself. He didn’t know what was real and what wasn’t. In such a situation\na man should step down from his authority and sort things through.\nEither way, he felt he needed to live these visions, not ignore them.

But Dalinar would give it this much: He would\ntreat the vision as real while he was part of it. If there were secrets to be\nfound here, only by playing along would he find them.\nHe looked about him. What was he being shown this time, and why?\nThe spearhead on his weapon was of good steel, though his cap appeared to\nbe bronze. One of the six men with him on the wall wore a breastplate of\nbronze; two others had poorly patched leather uniforms, sliced and resewn\nwith wide stitches.\nThe other men lounged about, idly looking out over the wall. Guard\nduty, Dalinar thought, stepping up and scanning the landscape outside. This\nrock formation was at the end of an enormous plain—the perfect situation\nfor a fortress. No army could approach without being seen long before its\narrival.\nThe air was cold enough that clumps of ice clung to the stone in\nshadowed corners. The sunlight did little to dispel the cold, and the weather\nexplained the lack of grass; the blades would be retracted into their holes,\nawaiting the relief of spring weather.\nDalinar pulled his cloak closer, prompting one of his companions to do\nthe same.\n“Storming weather,” the man muttered. “How long’s it going to last?\nBeen eight weeks already.”\nEight weeks? Forty days of winter at once? That was rare. Despite the\ncold, the other three soldiers looked anything but engaged by their guard\nduties. One was even dozing.\n“Stay alert,” Dalinar chided them.\nThey glanced at him, the one who had been dozing blinking awake. All\nthree seemed incredulous. One—a tall, red-haired man—scowled. “This\nfrom you, Leef?”\nDalinar bit back a retort. Who did they see him as?\nThe chill air made his breath steam, and from behind him he could\nhear metal clanging as men worked at forges and anvils below. The gates to\nthe fortress were closed, and the archer towers were manned to the left and\nright. They were at war, but guard duty was always boring work. It took\nwell trained soldiers to remain alert for hours on end. Perhaps that was why\nthere were so many soldiers here; if the quality of eyes watching could not\nbe assured, then quantity would serve.\nHowever, Dalinar had an advantage. The visions never showed him\nepisodes of idle peace; they threw him into times of conflict and change.\nTurning points. So it was that, despite dozens of other eyes watching, he\nwas the first to spot it.\n“There!” he said, leaning out over the side of the roughstone\ncrenellation. “What is that?”\nThe redheaded man raised a hand, shading his eyes. “Nothing. A\nshadow.”\n“No, it’s moving,” said one of the others. “Looks like people.\nMarching.”\nDalinar’s heart began to thump in anticipation as the red-haired man\ncalled the alert. More archers rushed onto the battlement, stringing bows.\nSoldiers gathered in the ruddy courtyard below.

Everything was made of\nthat same red rock, and Dalinar caught one of the men referring to this place\nas “Feverstone Keep.” He’d never heard of it.\nScouts galloped from the keep on horses. Why didn’t they have\noutriders already?\n“It has to be the rear defense force,” one soldier muttered. “They can’t\nhave gotten through our lines. Not with the Radiants fighting….”\nRadiants? Dalinar stepped closer to listen, but the man gave him a\nscowl and turned away. Whoever Dalinar was, the others didn’t much care\nfor him.\nApparently, this keep was a fallback position behind the front lines of a\nwar. So either that approaching force was friendly, or the enemy had\npunched through and sent an advance element to besiege the keep. These\nwere reserves, then, which was probably why they had been left with a few\nhorses. They still should have had outriders.\nWhen the scouts finally did gallop back to the keep, they bore white\nflags. Dalinar glanced at his companions, confirming his suspicions as they\nrelaxed. White meant friends. Yet would he have been sent here if it were\nthat simple? If it was just in his mind, would it fabricate a simple, boring\nvision when it never had before?\n“We need to be alert for a trap,” Dalinar said. “Someone find out what\nthose scouts saw. Did they identify banners only, or did they get a close\nlook?”\nThe other soldiers—including some of the archers who now filled the\nwall top—gave him strange looks. Dalinar cursed softly, glancing back out\nat the shadowy oncoming force. He had a foreboding itch in the back of his\nskull. Ignoring the odd looks, he hefted his spear and ran down the walkway\nof the wall top, reaching a set of stairs. They were built in switchbacks,\nrunning in zigzags straight down the tall wall, with no railing. He’d been on\nsuch fortifications before, and knew how to keep his eyes focused on the\nsteps to avoid vertigo.\nHe reached the bottom and—spear resting on his shoulder—struck out\nto find someone in charge. The buildings of Feverstone Keep were blocky\nand utilitarian, built up against one another along the rock walls of the\nnatural rift. Most had square raincatchers on top. With good food stores—\nor, if lucky, a Soulcaster—such a fortification could withstand a siege for\nyears.\nHe couldn’t read the rank insignias, but he could recognize an officer\nwhen he saw one standing in a blood-red cloak with a group of honor\nguards. He had no mail, just a shiny bronze breastplate over leather, and\nwas conferring with one of the scouts. Dalinar hurried up.\nOnly then did he see that the man’s eyes were dark brown. That gave\nDalinar a shock of incredulity. Those around him treated the man like a\nbrightlord.\n“…the Order of the Stonewards, my lord,” the still-mounted scout was\nsaying. “And a large number of Windrunners. All on foot.”\n“But why?” the darkeyed officer demanded. “Why are Radiants\ncoming here? They should be fighting the devils on the front lines!”"

They should be fighting the devils on the front lines!”\n“My lord,” the scout said, “our orders were to return as soon as we\nidentified them.”\n“Well, go back and find out why they’re here!” the officer bellowed,\ncausing the scout to flinch, then turn to ride away.\nThe Radiants. They were usually connected to Dalinar’s visions in one\nway or another. As the officer began to call commands to his attendants,\ntelling them to prep empty bunkers for the knights, Dalinar followed the\nscout toward the wall. Men crowded near the kill slits there, peering out at\nthe plain. Like those above, these wore motley uniforms that looked pieced\ntogether. They weren’t a ragged bunch, but were obviously wearing\nsecondhand leavings.\nThe scout rode through a sally port as Dalinar entered the shadow of\nthe enormous wall, walking up to the back of a crowd of soldiers. “What is\nit?” he asked.\n“The Radiants,” one of the men said. “They’ve broken into a run.”\n“It’s almost like they’re going to attack,” said another. He chuckled at\nhow ridiculous that sounded, though there was an edge of uncertainty to his\nvoice.\nWhat? Dalinar thought, anxious. “Let me through.”\nSurprisingly, the men parted. As Dalinar pushed by, he could sense\ntheir confusion. He’d given the command with the authority of a highprince\nand a lighteyes, and they’d obeyed instinctively. Now that they saw him,\nthey were uncertain. What was this simple guardsman doing ordering them\nabout?\nHe didn’t give them a chance to question him. He climbed onto the\nplatform against the wall, where a rectangular kill slit looked through the\nwall and onto the plain. It was too small for a man to get through, but wide\nenough for archers to fire out. Through it, Dalinar saw that the approaching\nsoldiers had formed a distinct line. Men and women in gleaming Shardplate\ncharged forward. The scout pulled to a halt, looking at the charging\nShardbearers. They ran shoulder to shoulder, not a single one of place. Like\na crystalline wave. As they drew closer, Dalinar could see that their Plate\nwas unpainted, but it glowed either blue or amber at the joints and across\nglyphs at the front, as with other Radiants he’d seen in his visions.\n“They don’t have their Shardblades out,” Dalinar said. “That’s a good\nsign.”\nThe scout outside backed his horse up. There looked to be a good two\nhundred Shardbearers out there. Alethkar owned some twenty Blades, Jah\nKeved a similar number. If one added up all the rest in the world, there\nmight be enough total to equal the two powerful Vorin kingdoms. That\nmeant, so far as he knew, there were less than hundred Blades in all of the\nworld. And here he saw two hundred Shardbearers gathered in one army. It\nwas mind-numbing.\nThe Radiants slowed, falling into a trot, then a walk. The soldiers\naround Dalinar grew still. The leading Radiants stopped in a line, immobile."

The leading Radiants stopped in a line, immobile.\nSuddenly, others began to fall from the sky. They hit with the sound of rock\ncracking, puffs of Stormlight blossoming from their figures. These all\nglowed blue.\nSoon, there were some three hundred Radiants out on the field. They\nbegan summoning their Blades. The weapons appeared in their hands, like\nfog forming and condensing. It was done in silence. Their visors were\ndown.\n“If them charging without swords was a good sign,” whispered one of\nthe men beside Dalinar, “then what does this mean?”\nA suspicion began to rise within Dalinar, the horror that he might\nknow what this vision was about to show him. The scout, at last unnerved,\nturned his horse and galloped back to the keep, screaming for the door to be\nopened to him. As if a little wood and stone would be a protection against\nhundreds of Shardbearers. A single man with Plate and Blade was almost an\narmy unto himself, and that wasn’t accounting for the strange powers these\npeople had.\nThe soldiers pulled the sally port open for the scout. Making a snap\ndecision, Dalinar leaped down and charged to the opening. Behind, the\nofficer Dalinar had seen earlier was clearing a path for himself to walk up to\nthe kill slit.\nDalinar reached the open door, darting through it just after the scout\ncharged back into the courtyard. Men called after Dalinar, terrified. He\nignored them, running out onto the open plain. The expansive, straight wall\nstretched above him, like a highway up to the sun itself. The Radiants were\nstill distant, though they’d stopped within bowshot. Transfixed by the\nbeautiful figures, Dalinar slowed, then stopped about a hundred feet away.\nOne knight stepped ahead of his companions, his brilliant cape a rich\nblue. His Shardblade of rippling steel had intricate carvings along the\ncenter. He held it toward the keep for a moment.\nThen he drove it point-first into the stone plain. Dalinar blinked. The\nShardbearer removed his helm, exposing a handsome head with blond hair\nand pale skin, light as that of a man from Shinovar. He tossed the helm to\nthe ground beside his blade. It rolled slightly as the Shardbearer made fists\nin his gauntlets, arms at his sides. He opened his palms wide, and the\ngauntlets fell free to the rocky ground.\nHe turned, his Shardplate falling off his body—breastplate dropping\nfree, greaves slipping off. Underneath, he wore a rumpled blue uniform. He\nstepped free of his bootlike sabatons and continued to walk away,\nShardplate and Shardblade—the most precious treasures any man could\nown—tossed to the ground and abandoned like refuse.\nThe others began to follow suit. Hundreds of men and women, driving\nShardblades into the stone and then removing their Plate. The sound of\nmetal hitting stone came like rain. Then like thunder.\nDalinar found himself running forward. The door behind him opened\nand some curious soldiers left the keep. Dalinar reached the Shardblades.\nThey sprouted from the rock like glittering silver trees, a forest of weapons."

Dalinar reached the Shardblades.\nThey sprouted from the rock like glittering silver trees, a forest of weapons.\nThey glowed softly in a way his own Shardblade never had, but as he\ndashed among them, their light started to fade.\nA terrible feeling struck him. A sense of immense tragedy, of pain and\nbetrayal. Stopping where he stood, he gasped, hand to his chest. What was\nhappening? What was that dreadful feeling, that screaming he swore he\ncould almost hear?\nThe Radiants. They walked away from their discarded weapons. They\nall seemed individuals now, each walking alone despite the crowd. Dalinar\ncharged after them, tripping over discarded breastplates and chunks of\narmor. He finally stumbled free of it all.\n“Wait!” he called.\nNone of them turned.\nHe could now see others in the distance, far off. A crowd of soldiers,\nnot wearing Shardplate, waiting for the Radiants to return. Who were they,\nand why hadn’t they come forward? Dalinar He caught up to the Radiants—\nthey weren’t walking very quickly—and grabbed one by the arm. The man\nturned; his skin was tan and his hair dark, like an Alethi. His eyes were of\nthe palest blue. Unnaturally so, in fact—the irises were nearly white.\n“Please,” Dalinar said. “Tell me why you are doing this.”\nThe former Shardbearer pulled his arm free and continued to walk\naway. Dalinar cursed, then ran into the midst of the Shardbearers. They\nwere of all races and nationalities, dark skin and light, some with white\nThaylen eyebrows, others with the skin ripples of the Selay. They walked\nwith eyes forward, not speaking to one another, steps slow but resolute.\n“Will someone tell me why?” Dalinar bellowed. “This is it, isn’t it?\nThe Day of Recreance, the day you betrayed mankind. But why?” None of\nthem spoke. It was as if he didn’t exist.\nPeople spoke of betrayal, of the day the Knights Radiant turned their\nbacks on their fellow men. What were they fighting, and why had they\nstopped? Two orders of knights were mentioned, Dalinar thought. But there\nwere ten orders. What of the other eight?\nDalinar fell to his knees in the sea of solemn individuals. “Please. I\nmust know.” Nearby, some of the keep’s soldiers had reached the\nShardblades—but rather than chasing after the Radiants, these men were\ncautiously pulling the Blades free. A few officers scrambled out of the keep,\ncalling for the Blades to be put down. They were soon outnumbered by men\nwho began boiling out of side gates and rushing toward the weapons.\n“They are the first,” a voice said.\nDalinar looked up to see that one of the knights had stopped beside\nhim. It was the man who looked Alethi. He looked over his shoulder at the\ncrowd gathering around the blades. Men had begun to scream at one\nanother, everyone scrambling to get a Blade before they were all claimed.\n“They are the first,” the Radiant said, turning to Dalinar. Dalinar\nrecognized the depth of that voice. It was the voice that always spoke to"

It was the voice that always spoke to\nhim in these visions. “They were the first, and they were also the last.”\n“Is this the Day of Recreance?” Dalinar asked.\n“These events will go down in history,” the Radiant said. “They will\nbe infamous. You will have many names for what happened here.”\n“But why?” Dalinar asked. “Please. Why did they abandon their\nduty?”\nThe figure seemed to study him. “I have said I that cannot be of much\nhelp to you. The Night of Sorrows will come, and the True Desolation. The\nEverstorm.”\n“Then answer my questions!” Dalinar said.\n“Read the book. Unite them.”\n“The book? The Way of Kings?”\nThe figure turned and walked from him, joining the other Radiants as\nthey crossed the stone plain, walking toward places unknown.\nDalinar looked back at the melee of soldiers rushing for Blades. Many\nhad already been claimed. There weren’t enough Blades for everyone, and\nsome had begun raising theirs up, using them to fend off those who got too\nclose. As he watched, a bellowing officer with a Blade was attacked by two\nmen behind him.\nThe glow from within the weapons had completely vanished.\nThe killing of that officer made others bold. Other skirmishes started,\nmen scrambling to attack those who had Blades, hoping to get one. Eyes\nbegan to burn. Screams, shouts, death. Dalinar watched until he found\nhimself in his quarters, tied to his chair. Renarin and Adolin watched\nnearby, looking tense.\nDalinar blinked, listening to the rain of the passing highstorm on the\nroof. “I’ve returned,” he said to his sons. “You may calm yourselves.”\nAdolin helped untie the ropes while Renarin stood up and fetched Dalinar a\ncup of orange wine.\nOnce Dalinar was free, Adolin stood back. The youth folded his arms.\nRenarin came back, his face pale. He looked to be having one of his\nepisodes of weakness; indeed, his legs were trembling. As soon as Dalinar\ntook the cup, the youth sat down in a chair and rested his head in his hands.\nDalinar sipped the sweet wine. He had seen wars in his visions before.\nHe had seen deaths and monsters, greatshells and nightmares. And yet, for\nsome reason, this one disturbed him more than any. He found his own hand\nshaking as he raised the cup for a second sip.\nAdolin was still looking at him.\n“Am I that bad to watch?” Dalinar asked.\n“The gibberish you speak is unnerving, Father,” Renarin said.\n“Unearthly, strange. Skewed, like a wooden building pushed to a slant by\nthe wind.”\n“You thrash about,” Adolin said. “You nearly tipped over the chair. I\nhad to hold it steady until you stilled.”\nDalinar stood up, sighing as he walked over to refill his cup. “And you\nstill think I don’t need to abdicate?”\n“The episodes are containable,” Adolin said, though he sounded"

I just didn’t want\nyou relying upon the delusions to make decisions about our house’s future.\nSo long as you accept that what you see isn’t real, we can move on. No\nreason for you to give up your seat.”\nDalinar poured the wine. He looked eastward, toward the wall, away\nfrom Adolin and Renarin. “I don’t accept that what I see isn’t real.”\n“What?” Adolin said. “But I thought I convinced—”\n“I accept that I’m no longer reliable,” Dalinar said. “And that there’s a\nchance I might be going mad. I accept that something is happening to me.”\nHe turned around. “When I first began seeing these visions, I believed them\nto be from the Almighty. You have convinced me that I may have been too\nhasty in my judgment. I don’t know enough to trust them. I could be mad.\nOr they could be supernatural without being of the Almighty.”\n“How could that happen?” Adolin said, frowning.\n“The Old Magic,” Renarin said softly, still sitting.\nDalinar nodded.\n“What?” Adolin said pointedly. “The Old Magic is a myth.”\n“Unfortunately, it is not,” Dalinar said, then took another drink of the\ncool wine. “I know this for a fact.”\n“Father,” Renarin said. “For the Old Magic to have affected you, you’d\nhave had to travel to the West and seek it. Wouldn’t you?”\n“Yes,” he said, ashamed. The empty place in his memories where his\nwife had once existed had never seemed as obvious to him as it did at that\nmoment. He tended to ignore it, with good reason. She’d vanished\ncompletely, and it was sometimes difficult for him to remember that he had\nbeen married.\n“These visions are not in line with what I’ve understood about the\nNightwatcher,” Renarin said. “Most consider her to be just some kind of\npowerful spren. Once you’ve sought her out and been given your reward\nand your curse, she’s supposed to leave you alone. When did you seek her?”\n“It’s been many years now,” Dalinar said.\n“Then this probably isn’t due to her influence,” Renarin said.\n“I agree,” Dalinar said.\n“But what did you ask for?” Adolin said, frowning.\n“My curse and boon are my own, son,” Dalinar said. “The specifics are\nnot important.”\n“But—”\n“I agree with Renarin,” Dalinar said, interrupting. “This is probably\nnot the Nightwatcher.”\n“All right, fine. But why bring it up?”\n“Because, Adolin,” Dalinar said, feeling exasperated. “I don’t know\nwhat is happening to me. These visions seem far too detailed to be products\nof my mind. But your arguments made me think. I could be wrong. Or you\ncould be wrong, and it could be the Almighty. Or it could be something\nentirely different. We don’t know, and that is why it is dangerous for me to\nbe left in command.”"

We don’t know, and that is why it is dangerous for me to\nbe left in command.”\n“Well, what I said still holds,” Adolin said stubbornly. “We can contain\nit.”\n“No, we can’t,” Dalinar said. “Just because it has come only during\nhighstorms in the past doesn’t mean it couldn’t expand to other times of\nstress. What if I were struck with an episode on the battlefield?” That was\nthe very same reason they didn’t let Renarin ride into battle.\n“If that happens,” Adolin said, “we’ll deal with it. For now, we could\njust ignore—”\nDalinar threw a hand up into the air. “Ignore? I cannot ignore\nsomething like this. The visions, the book, the things I feel—they’re\nchanging every aspect of me. How can I rule if I do not follow my\nconscience? If I continue as highprince, I second-guess my every decision.\nEither I decide to trust myself, or I step down. I cannot stomach the thought\nof something in-between.”\nThe room fell silent.\n“So what do we do?” Adolin said.\n“We make the choice,” Dalinar said. “I make the choice.”\n“Step down or keep heeding the delusions,” Adolin spat. “Either way\nwe’re letting them rule us.”\n“And you have a better option?” Dalinar demanded. “You’ve been\nquick to complain, Adolin, which seems a habit of yours. But I don’t see\nyou offering a legitimate alternative.”\n“I gave you one,” Adolin said. “Ignore the visions and move on!”\n“I said a legitimate option!”\nThe two stared at one another. Dalinar fought to keep his anger\ncontained. In many ways, he and Adolin were too similar. They understood\none another, and that enabled them to push in places that hurt.\n“Well,” Renarin said, “what if we proved whether or not the visions\nwere true?”\nDalinar glanced at him. “What?”\n“You say these dreams are detailed,” Renarin said, leaning forward\nwith hands clasped in front of him. “What, exactly, do you see?”\nDalinar hesitated, then gulped down the rest of his wine. For once he\nwished he had intoxicating violet instead of orange. “The visions are often\nof the Knights Radiant. At the end of each episode, someone—I think one\nof the Heralds—comes to me and commands me to unite the highprinces of\nAlethkar.”\nThe room fell silent, Adolin looking disturbed, Renarin just sitting\nquietly.\n“Today, I saw the Day of Recreance,” Dalinar continued. “The\nRadiants abandoned their Shards and walked away. The Plate and Blades…\nfaded somehow when they were abandoned. It seems such an odd detail to\nhave seen.” He looked at Adolin. “If these visions are fantasies, then I am a\ngreat deal more clever than I once thought myself.”\n“Do you remember any specifics we could check on?” Renarin asked.\n“Names? Locations? Events that might be traced in history?”\n“This last one was of a place called Feverstone Keep,” Dalinar said.\n“I’ve never heard of it,” Adolin said."

Events that might be traced in history?”\n“This last one was of a place called Feverstone Keep,” Dalinar said.\n“I’ve never heard of it,” Adolin said.\n“Feverstone Keep,” Dalinar repeated. “In my vision, there was some\nkind of war going on near there. The Radiants had been fighting on the front\nlines. They withdrew to this fortress, then abandoned their Shards there.”\n“Perhaps we could find something in history,” Renarin said. “Proof\nthat either this keep existed or that the Radiants didn’t do what you saw\nthere. Then we’d know, wouldn’t we? If the dreams are delusions or truth?”\nDalinar found himself nodding. Proving them had never occurred to\nhim, in part because he had assumed they were real at the start. Once he’d\nstarted questioning, he’d been more inclined to keep the nature of the\nvisions hidden and silent. But if he knew that he was seeing real events…\nwell, that would at least rule out the possibility of madness. It wouldn’t\nsolve everything, but it would help a great deal.\n“I don’t know,” Adolin said, more skeptical. “Father, you’re talking\nabout times before the Hierocracy. Will we be able to find anything in the\nhistories?”\n“There are histories from the time when the Radiants lived,” Renarin\nsaid. “That’s not as far back as the shadowdays or the Heraldic Epochs. We\ncould ask Jasnah. Isn’t this what she does? As a Veristitalian?”\nDalinar looked at Adolin. “It sounds like it’s worth a try, son.”\n“Maybe,” Adolin said. “But we can’t take the existence of a single\nplace as proof. You could have heard of this Feverstone Keep, and therefore\nincluded it.”\n“Well,” Renarin said, “that may be true. But if what Father sees are\njust delusions, then certainly we’ll be able to prove some parts of them\nuntrue. It seems impossible that every detail he imagines is one that he got\nfrom a story or history. Some aspects of the delusions would have to be pure\nfancy.”\nAdolin nodded slowly. “I…You’re right, Renarin. Yes, it’s a good\nplan.”\n“We need to get one of my scribes,” Dalinar said. “So I can dictate the\nvision I just had while it is fresh.”\n“Yes,” Renarin said. “The more details we have, the easier it will be to\nprove—or disprove—the visions.”\nDalinar grimaced, setting aside his cup and walking over to the others.\nHe sat down. “All right, but who would we use to record the dictation?”\n“You have a great number of clerks, Father,” Renarin said.\n“And they’re all either wife or daughter to one of my officers,” Dalinar\nsaid. How could he explain? It was painful enough for him to expose\nweakness to his sons. If news of what he saw got around to his officers, it\ncould weaken morale. There might come a time to reveal these things to his\nmen, but he would need to do so carefully. And he’d much rather know for\nhimself whether or not he was mad before he approached others.\n“Yes,” Adolin said, nodding—though Renarin still looked perplexed."

But, Father, we can’t afford to wait for Jasnah to return. It\ncould be months yet.”\n“Agreed.” Dalinar said. He sighed. There was another option.\n“Renarin, send a runner for your aunt Navani.”\nAdolin glanced at Dalinar, raising an eyebrow. “It’s a good idea. But I\nthought you didn’t trust her.”\n“I trust her to keep her word,” Dalinar said, resigned. “And to keep\nconfidence. I told her of my plans to abdicate, and she didn’t tell a soul.”\nNavani was excellent at keeping secrets. Far better than the women of his\ncourt. He trusted them to an extent, but keeping a secret like this would\nrequire someone supremely exacting in their words and thoughts.\nThat meant Navani. She would probably find a way to manipulate him\nusing the knowledge, but at least the secret would be safe from his men.\n“Go, Renarin,” Dalinar said.\nRenarin nodded and stood. He had apparently recovered from his fit,\nand walked surefooted to the door. As he left, Adolin approached Dalinar.\n“Father, what will you do if we prove that I’m right, and it’s just your own\nmind?”\n“A part of me wishes for that to happen,” Dalinar said, watching the\ndoor swing closed after Renarin. “I fear madness, but at least it is something\nfamiliar, something that can be dealt with. I will give you the princedom,\nthen seek help in Kharbranth. But if these things are not delusions, I face\nanother decision. Do I accept what they tell me or not? It may very well be\nbetter for Alethkar if I prove to be mad. It will be easier, at the least.”\nAdolin considered that, his brow furrowed, his jaw tense. “And\nSadeas? He seems to be nearing the completion of his investigation. What\ndo we do?”\nIt was a legitimate question. Troubles over Dalinar trusting the visions\nin relation to Sadeas had been what had drawn Dalinar and Adolin to\nargument in the first place.\nUnite them. That wasn’t just a command from the visions. It had been\nGavilar’s dream. A unified Alethkar. Had Dalinar let that dream—combined\nwith guilt over failing his brother—drive him to construct supernatural\nrationalizations for seeking his brother’s will?\nHe felt uncertain. He hated feeling uncertain.\n“Very well,” Dalinar said. “I give you leave to prepare for the worst,\njust in case Sadeas moves against us. Prepare our officers and call back the\ncompanies sent to patrol for bandits. If Sadeas denounces me as having\ntried to kill Elhokar, we will lock down our warcamp and go on alert. I\ndon’t intend to let him bring me in for execution.”\nAdolin looked relieved. “Thank you, Father.”\n“Hope it doesn’t come to that, son,” Dalinar said. “The moment Sadeas\nand I go to war in earnest, Alethkar as a nation will shatter. Ours are the two\nprincedoms that uphold the king, and if we turn to strife, the others will"

Ours are the two\nprincedoms that uphold the king, and if we turn to strife, the others will\neither pick sides or turn to wars of their own.”\nAdolin nodded, but Dalinar sat back, disturbed. I’m sorry, he thought\nto whatever force was sending the visions. But I have to be wise.\nIn a way, this seemed like a second test to him. The visions had told\nhim to trust Sadeas. Well, he would see what happened.\n“…and then it faded,” Dalinar said. “After that, I found myself back here.”\nNavani raised her pen, looking thoughtful. It hadn’t taken him long to\ntalk through the vision. She’d scribed expertly, picking out details from\nhim, knowing when to prod for more. She hadn’t said a thing about the\nirregularity of the request, nor had she seemed amused by his desire to write\ndown one of his delusions. She’d been businesslike and careful. She sat at\nhis writing desk now, hair bound up in curls and crossed with four hair-\nspikes. Her dress was red, matched by her lip paint, and her beautiful violet\neyes were curious.\nStormfather, Dalinar thought, but she’s beautiful.\n“Well?” Adolin asked. He stood leaning against the door out of the\nchamber. Renarin had gone off to collect a highstorm damage report. The\nlad needed practice at that sort of activity.\nNavani raised an eyebrow. “What was that, Adolin?”\n“What do you think, Aunt?” Adolin asked.\n“I have never heard of any of these places or events,” Navani said.\n“But I believe you weren’t expecting to me to know of them. Didn’t you\nsay you wished me to contact Jasnah?”\n“Yes,” Adolin said. “But surely you have analysis.”\n“I reserve judgment, dear,” Navani said, standing up and folding the\npaper by pressing down with her safehand, holding it in place while she\ncreased the fold tight. She smiled, walking by Adolin and patting him on the\nshoulder. “Let’s see what Jasnah says before we do any analyzing, shall\nwe?”\n“I suppose,” Adolin said. He sounded dissatisfied.\n“I spent some time talking with that young lady of yours yesterday,”\nNavani noted to him. “Danlan? I think you’ve made a wise choice. She’s\ngot a mind in that head of hers.”\nAdolin perked up. “You like her?”\n“Quite a bit,” Navani said. “I also discovered that she is very fond of\navramelons. Did you know that?”\n“I didn’t, actually.”\n“Good. I would have hated to do all that work to find you a means of\npleasing her, only to discover that you already knew it. I took the liberty of\npurchasing a basket of the melons on my way here. You’ll find them in the\nantechamber, watched over by a bored soldier who didn’t look like he was\ndoing anything important. If you were to visit her with them this afternoon,\nI think you’d find yourself very well received.”\nAdolin hesitated. He probably knew that Navani was deflecting him\nfrom worrying over Dalinar. However, he relaxed, then started smiling."

However, he relaxed, then started smiling.\n“Well, that might make for a pleasant change, considering events lately.”\n“I thought it might,” Navani said. “I’d suggest going soon; those\nmelons are perfectly ripe. Besides, I wish to speak with your father.”\nAdolin kissed Navani fondly on the cheek. “Thank you, Mashala.” He\nallowed her to get away with some things that others could not; around his\nfavored aunt, he was much like a child again. Adolin’s smile widened as he\nmade his way out the door.\nDalinar found himself smiling as well. Navani knew his son well. His\nsmile didn’t last long, however, as he realized that Adolin’s departure left\nhim alone with Navani. He stood up. “What is it you wished to ask of me?”\nhe asked.\n“I didn’t say I wanted to ask anything of you, Dalinar,” she said. “I just\nwanted to talk. We are family, after all. We don’t spend enough time\ntogether.”\n“If you wish to speak, I shall fetch some soldiers to accompany us.”\nHe glanced at the antechamber outside. Adolin had shut the second door at\nthe end, closing off his view of his guards—and their view of him.\n“Dalinar,” she said, walking up to him. “That would kind of defeat the\npoint of sending Adolin away. I was after some privacy.”\nHe felt himself growing stiff. “You should go now.”\n“Must I?”\n“Yes. People will think this is inappropriate. They will talk.”\n“You imply that something inappropriate could happen, then?” Navani\nsaid, sounding almost girlishly eager.\n“Navani, you are my sister.”\n“We aren’t related by blood,” she replied. “In some kingdoms, a union\nbetween us would be mandated by tradition, once your brother died.”\n“We aren’t in other countries. This is Alethkar. There are rules.”\n“I see,” she said, strolling closer to him. “And what will you do if I\ndon’t go? Will you call for help? Have me hauled away?”\n“Navani,” he said sufferingly. “Please. Don’t do this again. I’m tired.”\n“Excellent. That might make it easier to get what I want.”\nHe closed his eyes. I can’t take this right now. The vision, the\nconfrontation with Adolin, his own uncertain emotions…He didn’t know\nwhat to make of things any longer.\nTesting the visions was a good decision, but he couldn’t shake the\ndisorientation he felt from being unable to decide what to do next. He liked\nto make decisions and stick to them. He couldn’t do that.\nIt grated on him.\n“I thank you for your scribing and for your willingness to keep this\nquiet,” he said, opening his eyes. “But I really must ask you to leave now,\nNavani.”\n“Oh, Dalinar,” she said softly. She was close enough that he could\nsmell her perfume. Stormfather, but she was beautiful. Seeing her brought\nto his mind thoughts of days long past, when he’d desired her so strongly\nthat he’d nearly grown to hate Gavilar for winning her affection."

The other\nhighprinces and lighteyes deserve recrimination for what they do, and I\nhave let them know it. If I abandon my principles, then I become something\nfar worse than they. A hypocrite!”\nShe froze.\n“Please,” he said, tense with emotion. “Just go. Do not taunt me\ntoday.”\nShe hesitated, then walked away without a word.\nShe would never know how much he wished her to have made one\nmore objection. In his state, he likely would have been unable to argue\nfurther. Once the door shut, he let himself sit down in his chair, exhaling.\nHe closed his eyes.\nAlmighty above, he thought. Please.

Subject: a prostitute.\nBack ground unknown.\nA razor-edged arrow snapped into the wood next to Kaladin’s face. He\ncould feel warm blood seep from a gash on his cheek, creeping down his\nface, mixing with the sweat dripping from his chin.\n“Stay firm!” he bellowed, charging over the uneven ground, the\nbridge’s familiar weight on his shoulders. Nearby—just ahead and to the\nleft—Bridge Twenty floundered, four men at the front falling to arrows,\ntheir corpses tripping up those behind.\nThe Parshendi archers knelt on the other side of the chasm, singing\ncalmly despite the hail of arrows from Sadeas’s side. Their black eyes were\nlike shards of obsidian. No whites. Just that emotionless black. In those\nmoments—listening to men scream, cry, yell, howl—Kaladin hated the\nParshendi as much as he hated Sadeas and Amaram. How could they sing\nwhile they killed?\nThe Parshendi in front of Kaladin’s crew pulled and aimed. Kaladin\nscreamed at them, feeling a strange surge of strength as the arrows were\nloosed.\nThe shafts zipped through the air in a focused wave. Ten shafts struck\nthe wood near Kaladin’s head, their force throwing a shudder through it,\nchips of wood splintering free. But not a one struck flesh.\nAcross the chasm, several of the Parshendi lowered their bows,\nbreaking off their chanting. Their demonic faces bore looks of stupefaction.\n“Down!” Kaladin yelled as the bridge crew reached the chasm. The\nground was rough here, covered in bulbous rockbuds. Kaladin stepped on\nthe vine from one of them, causing the plant to retract. The bridgemen\nheaved the bridge up and off their shoulders, then expertly stepped aside,"

Sixteen other bridge crews lined up with them,\nsetting their bridges down. Behind, Sadeas’s heavy cavalry thundered\nacross the plateau toward them.\nThe Parshendi drew again.\nKaladin gritted his teeth, throwing his weight against one of the\nwooden bars on the side, helping shove the massive construction across the\nchasm. He hated this part; the bridgemen were so exposed.\nSadeas’s archers kept firing, moving to a focused, disruptive attack\nintended to force back the Parshendi. As always, the archers didn’t seem to\nmind if they hit bridgemen, and several of those shafts flew dangerously\nclose to Kaladin. He continued to push—sweating, bleeding—and felt a\nstab of pride for Bridge Four. They were already beginning to move like\nwarriors, light on their feet, moving erratically, making it more difficult for\nthe archers to draw a bead on them. Would Gaz or Sadeas’s men notice?\nThe bridge thumped into place, and Kaladin bellowed the retreat.\nBridgemen ducked out of the way, dodging between thick-shafted black\nParshendi arrows and lighter green-fletched ones from Sadeas’s archers.\nMoash and Rock hoisted themselves up onto the bridge and ran across it,\nleaping down beside Kaladin. Others scattered around the back of the\nbridge, ducking in front of the oncoming cavalry charge.\nKaladin lingered, waving for his men to get out of the way. Once they\nwere all free, he glanced back at the bridge, which bristled with arrows. Not\na single man down. A miracle. He turned to run—\nSomeone stumbled to his feet on the other side of the bridge. Dunny.\nThe youthful bridgeman had a white and green fletched arrow sprouting\nfrom his shoulder. His eyes were wide, dazed.\nKaladin cursed, running back. Before he’d taken two steps, a black-\nhafted arrow took the youth in the other side. He fell to the deck of the\nbridge, blood spraying the dark wood.\nThe charging horses did not slow. Frantic, Kaladin reached the side of\nthe bridge, but something pulled him back. Hands on his shoulder. He\nstumbled, spinning to find Moash there. Kaladin snarled at him, trying to\nshove the man aside, but Moash—using a move Kaladin himself had taught\nhim—yanked Kaladin sideways, tripping him. Moash threw himself down,\nholding Kaladin to the ground as heavy cavalry thundered across the bridge,\narrows cracking against their silvery armor.\nBroken bits of arrow sprinkled to the ground. Kaladin struggled for a\nmoment, but then let himself fall still.\n“He’s dead,” Moash said, harshly. “There’s nothing you could have\ndone. I’m sorry.”\nThere’s nothing you could have done….\nThere isn’t ever anything I can do.

Stormfather, why can’t I save them?\nThe bridge stopped shaking, the cavalry smashing into the Parshendi\nand making space for the foot soldiers, who clanked across next. The\ncavalry would retreat after the foot soldiers gained purchase, the horses too\nvaluable to risk in extended fighting.\nYes, Kaladin thought. Think about the tactics. Think about the battle.\nDon’t think about Dunny.\nHe pushed Moash off him, rising. Dunny’s corpse was mangled\nbeyond recognition. Kaladin set his jaw and turned, striding away without\nlooking back. He brushed past the watching bridgemen and stepped up to\nthe lip of the chasm, clasping his hands to his forearms behind his back, feet\nspread. It wasn’t dangerous, so long as he stood far down from the bridge.\nThe Parshendi had put away bows and were falling back. The chrysalis was\na towering, oval stone mound on the far left side of the plateau.\nKaladin wanted to watch. It helped him think like a soldier, and\nthinking like a soldier helped him get over the deaths of those near him. The\nother bridgemen tentatively approached and filled in around him, standing\nat parade rest. Even Shen the parshman joined them, silently imitating the\nothers. He’d joined every bridge run so far without complaint. He didn’t\nrefuse to march against his cousins; he didn’t try to sabotage the assault.\nGaz was disappointed, but Kaladin wasn’t surprised. That was how\nparshmen were.\nExcept the ones on the other side of the chasm. Kaladin stared at the\nfighting, but had difficulty focusing on the tactics. Dunny’s death tore at\nhim too much. The lad had been a friend, one of the first to support him,\none of the best of the bridgemen.\nEach bridgeman dead edged them closer to disaster. It would take\nweeks to train the men properly. They’d lose half of their number—perhaps\neven more—before they were anywhere near ready to fight. That wasn’t\ngood enough.\nWell, you’ll have to find a way to fix it, Kaladin thought. He’d made his\ndecision, and had no room for despair. Despair was a luxury.\nHe broke parade rest and stalked away from the chasm. The other\nbridgemen turned to look after him, surprised. Kaladin had recently taken to\nwatching entire battles standing like that. Sadeas’s soldiers had noticed.\nMany saw it as bridgemen behaving above their station. A few, however,\nseemed to respect Bridge Four for the display. He knew there were rumors\nabout him because of the storm; these were adding to those.\nBridge Four followed, and Kaladin led them across the rocky plateau.\nHe pointedly did not look again at the broken, mangled body on the bridge.\nDunny had been one of the only bridgemen to retain any hint of innocence.\nAnd now he was dead, trampled by Sadeas, struck by arrows from both\nsides. Ignored, forgotten, abandoned.\nThere was nothing Kaladin could do for him. So instead, Kaladin made\nhis way to where the members of Bridge Eight lay, exhausted, on a patch of\nopen stone. Kaladin remembered lying like that after his first bridge runs.\nNow he barely felt winded."

Kaladin remembered lying like that after his first bridge runs.\nNow he barely felt winded.\nAs usual, the other bridge crews had left their wounded behind as they\nretreated. One poor man from Eight was crawling toward the others, an\narrow through his thigh. Kaladin walked up to him. He had dark brown skin\nand brown eyes, his thick black hair pulled back into a long, braided tail.\nPainspren crawled around him. He looked up with as Kaladin and the\nmembers of Bridge Four loomed over him.\n“Hold still,” Kaladin said softly, kneeling and gently turning the man\nto get a good look at the wounded thigh. Kaladin prodded at it, thoughtful.\n“Teft, we’ll need a fire. Get out your tinder. Rock, you still have my needle\nand thread? I’ll need that. Where’s Lopen with the water?”\nThe members of Bridge Four were silent. Kaladin looked up from the\nconfused, wounded man.\n“Kaladin,” Rock said. “You know how the other bridge crews have\ntreated us.”\n“I don’t care,” Kaladin said.\n“We don’t have any money left,” Drehy said. “Even pooling our\nincome, we barely have enough for bandages for our own men.”\n“I don’t care.”\n“If we care for the wounded of other bridge crews,” Drehy said,\nshaking a blond head, “we’ll have to feed them, tend them….”\n“I will find a way,” Kaladin said.\n“I—” Rock began.\n“Storm you!” Kaladin said, standing and sweeping his hand over the\nplateau. The bodies of bridgemen lay scattered, ignored. “Look at that! Who\ncares for them? Not Sadeas. Not their fellow bridgemen. I doubt even the\nHeralds themselves spare a thought for these.\n“I won’t stand there and watch while men die behind me. We have to\nbe better than that! We can’t look away like the lighteyes, pretending we\ndon’t see. This man is one of us. Just like Dunny was.\n“The lighteyes talk about honor. They spout empty claims about their\nnobility. Well, I’ve only known one man in my life who was a true man of\nhonor. He was a surgeon who would help anyone, even those who hated\nhim. Especially those who hated him. Well, we’re going to show Gaz, and\nSadeas, Hashal, and any other sodden fool who cares to watch, what he\ntaught me. Now go to work and stop complaining!”\nBridge Four stared at him with wide, ashamed eyes, then burst into\nmotion. Teft organized a triage unit, sending some men to search for other\nwounded bridgemen and others to gather rockbud bark for a fire. Lopen and\nDabbid rushed off to fetch their litter.\nKaladin knelt down and felt at the wounded man’s leg, checking to see\nhow quickly the blood leaked, and determined that he wouldn’t need to\ncauterize. He broke the shaft and wiped the wound with some conicshell\nmucus for numbing. Then he pulled the wood free, eliciting a grunt, and\nused his personal set of bandages to wrap the wound."

Then he pulled the wood free, eliciting a grunt, and\nused his personal set of bandages to wrap the wound.\n“Hold this with your hands,” Kaladin instructed. “And don’t walk on\nit. I’ll check on you before we march back to camp.”\n“How…” the man said. He didn’t have even a hint of an accent.\nKaladin had expected him to be Azish because of the dark skin. “How will I\nget back if I can’t walk on the leg?”\n“We will carry you,” Kaladin said.\nThe man looked up, obviously shocked. “I…” Tears formed in his\neyes. “Thank you.”\nKaladin nodded curtly, turning as Rock and Moash brought over\nanother wounded man. Teft had a fire growing; it smelled of pungent wet\nrockbud. The new man had hit his head and had a long gash in his arm.\nKaladin held out a hand for his thread.\n“Kaladin, lad,” Teft said with a soft voice, handing him the thread and\nkneeling. “Now, don’t mark this as complaining, because it ain’t. But how\nmany men can we really carry back with us?”\n“We’ve done three before,” Kaladin said. “Lashed to the top of the\nbridge. I’ll bet we could fit three more and carry another in the water litter.”\n“And if we have more than seven?”\n“If we bandage them right, some might be able to walk.”\n“And if there are still more?”\n“Storm it, Teft,” Kaladin said, beginning to sew. “Then we bring the\nones we can and haul the bridge back out again to fetch those we left\nbehind. We’ll bring Gaz with us if the soldiers worry that we’ll run away.”\nTeft was silent, and Kaladin steeled himself for incredulity. Instead,\nhowever, the grizzled soldier smiled. He actually seemed a little watery-\neyed. “Kelek’s breath. It’s true. I never thought…”\nKaladin frowned, looking up at Teft and holding a hand to the wound\nto stanch the bleeding. “What was that?”\n“Oh, nothing.” He scowled. “Get back to work! That lad needs you.”\nKaladin turned back to his sewing.\n“You still carrying a full pouch of spheres with you, like I told you?”\nTeft asked.\n“I can’t very well leave them behind in the barracks. But we’ll need to\nspend them soon.”\n“You’ll do nothing of the sort,” Teft said. “Those spheres are luck, you\nhear me? Keep them with you and always keep them infused.”\nKaladin sighed. “I think there’s something wrong with this batch. They\nwon’t hold their Stormlight. They fall dun after just a few days, every time.\nPerhaps it’s something to do with the Shattered Plains. It has happened to\nthe other bridgemen too.”\n“Odd, that,” Teft said, rubbing his chin. “This was a bad approach.\nThree bridges down. Lots of bridgemen dead. Interesting how we didn’t\nlose anyone.”\n“We lost Dunny.”\n“But not on the approach. You always run point, and the arrows always\nseem to miss us. Odd, eh?”\nKaladin looked up again, frowning. “What are you saying, Teft?”"

Get back to that sewing! How many times do I have to tell\nyou?”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow, but turned back to his work. Teft had been\nacting very strange lately. Was it the stress? A lot of people were\nsuperstitious about spheres and Stormlight.\nRock and his team brought three more wounded, then said that was all\nthey’d found. Bridgemen who fell often ended up like Dunny, getting\ntrampled. Well, at least Bridge Four wouldn’t have to make a return trip to\nthe plateau.\nThe three had bad arrow wounds, and so Kaladin left the man with the\ngash on his arm to them, instructing Skar to keep pressure on the unfinished\nsewing job. Teft heated a dagger for cauterization; these newcomers had\nobviously lost a lot of blood. One probably wouldn’t make it.\nSo much of the world is at war, he thought as he worked. The dream\nhad highlighted what others already spoke of. Kaladin hadn’t known,\ngrowing up in remote Hearthstone, how fortunate his town had been to\navoid battle.\nThe entire world warred, and he struggled to save a few impoverished\nbridgemen. What good did it do? And yet he continued searing flesh,\nsewing, saving lives as his father had taught him. He began to understand\nthe sense of futility he’d seen in his father’s eyes on those occasional\ndarkened nights when Lirin had turned to his wine in solitude.\nYou’re trying to make up for failing Dunny, Kaladin thought. Helping\nthese others won’t bring him back.\nHe lost the one he’d suspected would die, but saved the other four, and\nthe one who’d taken a knock to the head was beginning to wake up. Kaladin\nsat back on his knees, weary, hands covered in blood. He washed them off\nwith a stream of water from Lopen’s waterskins, then reached up, finally\nremembering his own wound, where the arrow had sliced his cheek.\nHe froze. He prodded at his skin, but couldn’t find the wound. He had\nfelt blood on his cheek and chin. He’d felt the arrow slice him, hadn’t he?\nHe stood up, feeling a chill, and raised his hand to his forehead. What\nwas happening?\nSomeone stepped up beside him. Moash’s now-clean-shaven face\nexposed a faded scar along his chin. He studied Kaladin. “About Dunny…”\n“You were right to do what you did,” Kaladin said. “You probably\nsaved my life. Thank you.”\nMoash nodded slowly. He turned to look at the four wounded men;\nLopen and Dabbid were giving them drinks of water, asking their names “I\nwas wrong about you,” Moash said suddenly, holding out a hand to\nKaladin.\nKaladin took the hand, hesitant. “Thank you.”\n“You’re a fool and an instigator. But you’re an honest one.” Moash\nchuckled to himself. “If you get us killed, it won’t be on purpose. Can’t say\nthat for some I’ve served under. Anyway, let’s get these men ready for\nmoving.”"

Oh, Almighty, release me.”\n—Dated Palaheses, 1173, unknown seconds pre-death. Subject: a\nwealthy lighteyes. Sample collected secondhand.\nThe cold night air threatened that a stretch of winter might soon be coming.\nDalinar wore a long, thick uniform coat over trousers and shirt. It buttoned\nstiffly up the chest and to the collar, and was long in the back and on the\nsides, coming down to his ankles, flowing at the waist like a cloak. In\nearlier years, it might have been worn with a takama, though Dalinar had\nnever liked the skirtlike garments.\nThe purpose of the uniform was not fashion or tradition, but to\ndistinguish him easily for those who followed him. He wouldn’t have nearly\nthe problem with the other lighteyes if they would at least wear their colors.\nHe stepped onto the king’s feasting island. Stands had been set up at\nthe sides where the braziers normally stood, each one bearing one of those\nnew fabrials that gave off heat. The stream between the islands had slowed\nto a trickle; ice had stopped melting in the highlands.\nAttendance at the feast tonight was small, though that was mostly\nmanifest on the four islands that were not the king’s. Where there was\naccess to Elhokar and the highprinces, people would attend even if the feast\nwere held in the middle of a highstorm. Dalinar walked down the central\npathway, and Navani—sitting at a women’s dining table—caught his eyes.\nShe turned away, perhaps still remembering his abrupt words to her at their\nlast meeting.\nWit wasn’t at his customary place insulting those who walked onto the\nking’s island; in fact, he wasn’t to be seen at all. Not surprising, Dalinar\nthought. Wit didn’t like to grow predictable; he’d spent several recent feasts\non his pedestal doling out insults. Likely he felt he’d played out that tactic.\nAll nine other highprinces were in attendance. Their treatment of\nDalinar had grown stiff and cold since refusing his requests to fight\ntogether. As if they were offended by the mere offer. Lesser lighteyes made\nalliances, but the highprinces were like kings themselves. Other highprinces\nwere rivals, to be kept at arm’s length.\nDalinar sent a servant to fetch him food and sat down at the table. His\narrival had been delayed while he took reports from the companies he’d\ncalled back, so he was one of the last to eat. Most of the others had turned\nto mingling. To the right, an officer’s daughter was playing a serene flute\nmelody to a group of onlookers. To the left, three women had set up\nsketchpads and were each drawing the same man. Women were known to\nchallenge each other to duels in the way of men with Shardblades, though\nthey rarely used the word.

These were always “friendly competitions” or\n“games of talent.”\nHis food arrived, steamed stagm—a brownish tuber that grew in deep\npuddles—atop a bed of boiled tallew. The grain was puffed with water, and\nthe entire meal was drenched in a thick, peppery, brown gravy. He slid out\nhis knife and sliced a disk off the end of the stagm. Using his knife to\nspread tallew over the top, he grasped the vegetable disk between two\nfingers and began eat. It had been prepared both spicy and hot this night,\nprobably because of the chill, and tasted good as he chewed, the steam from\nhis plate fogging the air in front of him.\nSo far, Jasnah had not replied regarding his vision, though Navani\nclaimed she might be able to find something on her own. She was a\nrenowned scholar herself, though her interests had always been more in\nfabrials. He glanced at her. Was he a fool to off end her as he had? Would it\nmake her use the knowledge of his visions against him?\nNo, he thought. She wouldn’t be that petty. Navani did seem to care for\nhim, though her affection was inappropriate.\nThe chairs around him were left empty. He was becoming a pariah,\nfirst because of his talk of the Codes, then because of his attempts to get the\nhighprinces to work with him, and finally because of Sadeas’s investigation.\nNo wonder Adolin was worried.\nSuddenly, someone slid right into the seat beside Dalinar, wearing a\nblack cloak against the chill. It wasn’t one of the highprinces. Who would\ndare—\nThe figure lowered his hood, revealing Wit’s hawklike face. All lines\nand peaks, with a sharp nose and jaw, delicate eyebrows, and keen eyes.\nDalinar sighed, waiting for the inevitable stream of too-clever quips.\nWit, however, didn’t speak. He inspected the crowd, his expression\nintense.\nYes, Dalinar thought. Adolin is right about this one too. Dalinar\nhimself had judged the man too harshly in the past. He was not the fool\nsome of his predecessors had been. Wit continued in silence, and Dalinar\ndecided that—perhaps—the man’s prank this night was to sit down beside\npeople and unnerve them. It wasn’t much of a prank, but Dalinar often\nmissed the point of what Wit did. Perhaps it was terribly clever if one had\nthe mind for it. Dalinar returned to his meal.\n“Winds are changing,” Wit whispered.\nDalinar glanced at him.\nWit’s eyes narrowed, and he scanned the night sky. “It’s been\nhappening for months now. A whirlwind. Shifting and churning, blowing us\nround and around. Like a world spinning, but we can’t see it because we’re\ntoo much a part of it.”\n“World spinning. What foolishness is this?”\n“The foolishness of men who care, Dalinar,” Wit said. “And the\nbrilliance of those who do not. The second depend on the first—but also\nexploit the first—while the first misunderstand the second, hoping that the\nsecond are more like the first. And all of their games steal our time.

He seemed preoccupied, unlike his usual self.\n“Nonsense. Balderdash. Figgldygrak. Isn’t it odd that gibberish words are\noften the sounds of other words, cut up and dismembered, then stitched into\nsomething like them—yet wholly unlike them at the same time?”\nDalinar frowned.\n“I wonder if you could do that to a man.

If you do put a\nman together like that, Dalinar, be sure to name him Gibberish, after me. Or\nperhaps Gibletish.”\n“Is that your name, then? Your real name?”\n“No, my friend,” Wit said, standing up. “I’ve abandoned my real\nname. But when next we meet, I’ll think of a clever one for you to call me.\nUntil then, Wit will suffice—or if you must, you may call me Hoid. Watch\nyourself; Sadeas is planning a revelation at the feast tonight, though I know\nnot what it is. Farewell. I’m sorry I didn’t insult you more.”\n“Wait, you’re leaving?”\n“I must. I hope to return. I’ll do so if I’m not killed. Probably will\nanyway. Apologize to your nephew for me.”\n“He won’t be happy,” Dalinar said. “He’s fond of you.”\n“Yes, it’s one of his more admirable traits,” Wit said. “Alongside that\nof paying me, letting me eat his expensive food, and giving me opportunity\nto make sport of his friends. The cosmere, unfortunately, takes precedence\nover free food. Watch yourself, Dalinar. Life becomes dangerous, and\nyou’re at the center of it.”\nWit nodded once, then ducked into the night. He put his hood up, and\nsoon Dalinar couldn’t separate him from the darkness.\nDalinar turned back to his meal. Sadeas is planning a revelation at the\nfeast tonight, though I know not what it is. Wit was rarely wrong—though\nhe was almost always odd. Was he really leaving, or would he still be in\ncamp the next morning, laughing at the prank he had played on Dalinar?\nNo, Dalinar thought. That wasn’t a prank. He waved over a master-\nservant in black and white. “Fetch my elder son for me.”\nThe servant bowed and withdrew. Dalinar ate the rest of his food in\nsilence, glancing occasionally at Sadeas and Elhokar. They weren’t at the\ndining table any longer, and so Sadeas’s wife had joined them. Ialai was a"

Ialai was a\ncurvaceous woman who reportedly dyed her hair. That indicated foreign\nblood in her family’s past—Alethi hair always bred true, proportionate to\nhow much Alethi blood you had. Foreign blood would mean stray hairs of\nanother color. Ironically, mixed blood was far more common in lighteyes\nthan darkeyes. Darkeyes rarely married foreigners, but the Alethi houses\noften needed alliances or money from outside.\nFood finished, Dalinar stepped down from the king’s table onto the\nisland proper. The woman was still playing her melancholy song. She was\nquite good. A few moments later, Adolin strode onto the king’s island. He\nhurried over to Dalinar. “Father? You sent for me?”\n“Stay close. Wit told me that Sadeas plans to make a storm of\nsomething tonight.”\nAdolin’s expression darkened. “Time to go, then.”\n“No. We need to let this play out.”\n“Father—”\n“But you may prepare,” Dalinar said softly. “Just in case. You invited\nofficers of our guard to the feast tonight?”\n“Yes,” Adolin said. “Six of them.”\n“They have my further invitation to the king’s island. Pass the word.\nWhat of the King’s Guard?”\n“I’ve made sure that some of the ones guarding the island tonight are\namong those most loyal to you.” Adolin nodded toward a space in the\ndarkness to the side of the feasting basin. “I think we should position them\nover there. It’ll make a good line of retreat in case the king tries to have you\narrested.”\n“I still don’t think it will come to that.”\n“You can’t be sure. Elhokar allowed this investigation in the first place,\nafter all. He’s growing more and more paranoid.”\nDalinar glanced over at the king. The younger man almost always\nwore his Shardplate these days, though he didn’t have it on now. He seemed\ncontinually on edge, glancing over his shoulder, eyes darting from side to\nside.\n“Let me know when the men are in position,” Dalinar said.\nAdolin nodded, walking away quickly.\nThe situation gave Dalinar little stomach for mingling. Still, standing\nalone and looking awkward was no better, so he made his way to where\nHighprince Hatham was speaking with a small group of lighteyes beside the\nmain firepit. They nodded to Dalinar as he joined them; regardless of the\nway they were treating him in general, they would never turn him away at a\nfeast like this. That simply wasn’t done to one of his rank.\n“Ah, Brightlord Dalinar,” Hatham said in his smooth, overly polite\nway. The long-necked, slender man wore a ruffled green shirt underneath a\nrobelike coat, with a darker green silk scarf around the neck. A faintly\nglowing ruby sat on each of his fingers; they’d each had some of their\nStormlight drained away by a fabrial made for the purpose.\nOf Hatham’s four companions, two were lesser lighteyes and one was\na short white-robed ardent Dalinar didn’t know.

The last was a red-gloved\nNatan man with bluish skin and stark white hair, two locks dyed a deep red\nand braided down to hang alongside his cheeks. He was a visiting dignitary;\nDalinar had seen him at the feasts. What was his name again?\n“Tell me, Brightlord Dalinar,” Hatham said. “Have you been paying\nmuch attention to the conflict between the Tukari and the Emuli?”\n“It’s a religious conflict, isn’t it?” Dalinar asked. Both were Makabaki\nkingdoms, on the southern coast where trade was plentiful and profitable.\n“Religious?” the Natan man said. “No, I wouldn’t say that. All\nconflicts are essentially economic in nature.”\nAu-nak, Dalinar recalled. That’s his name. He spoke with an airy\naccent, overextending all of his “ah” and “oh” sounds.\n“Money is behind every war,” Au-nak continued. “Religion is but an\nexcuse. Or perhaps a justification.”\n“There’s a difference?” the ardent said, obviously taking offense at Au-\nnak’s tone.\n“Of course,” Au-nak said. “An excuse is what you make after the deed\nis done, while a justification is what you offer before.”\n“I would say an excuse is something you claim, but do not believe,\nNak-ali.” Hatham was using the high form of Au-nak’s name. “While a\njustification is something you actually believe.” Why such respect? The\nNatan must have something that Hatham wanted.\n“Regardless,” Au-nak said. “This particular war is over the city of\nSesemalex Dar, which the Emuli have made their capital. It’s an excellent\ntrade city, and the Tukari want it.”\n“I’ve heard of Sesemalex Dar,” Dalinar said, rubbing his chin. “The\ncity is quite spectacular, filling rifts cut into the stone.”\n“Indeed,” Au-nak said. “There’s a particular composition of the stone\nthere that lets water drain. The design is amazing. It’s obviously one of the\nDawncities.”\n“My wife would have something to say on that,” Hatham said. “She\nmakes the Dawncities her study.”\n“The city’s pattern is central to the Emuli religion,” the ardent said.\n“They claim it is their ancestral homeland, a gift to them from the Heralds.\nAnd the Tukari are led by that god-priest of theirs, Tezim. So the conflict is\nreligious in nature.”\n“And if the city weren’t such a fantastic port,” Au-nak said, “would\nthey be as persistent about proclaiming the city’s religious significance? I\nthink not. They’re pagans, after all, so we can’t presume their religion has\nany real importance.”\nTalk of the Dawncities had been popular lately among the lighteyes—\nthe idea that certain cities could trace their origins back to the Dawnsingers.\nPerhaps…\n“Have any of you heard of a place known as Feverstone Keep?”\nDalinar asked.\nThe others shook their heads; even Au-nak had nothing to say.\n“Why?” Hatham asked.\n“Just curious.”"

When would Sadeas make\nhis announcement? If he intended to suggest that Dalinar be arrested, he\nwouldn’t do it at a feast, would he?\nDalinar forced his attention back to the conversation. He really should\npay more heed to what was happening in the world. Once, news of which\nkingdoms were in conflict had fascinated him. So much had changed since\nthe visions began.\n“Perhaps it’s not economic or religious in nature,” Hatham said, trying\nto bring an end to the argument. “Everyone knows that the Makabaki tribes\nhave odd hatreds of one another.”\n“Perhaps,” Au-nak said.\n“Does it matter?” Dalinar asked.\nThe others turned to him.\n“It’s just another war. If they weren’t fighting one another, they’d find\nothers to attack. It’s what we do. Vengeance, honor, riches, religion—the\nreasons all just produce the same result.”\nThe others fell still, the silence quickly growing awkward.\n“Which devotary do you credit, Brightlord Dalinar?” Hatham asked,\nthoughtful, as if trying to remember something he’d forgotten.\n“The Order of Talenelat.”\n“Ah,” Hatham said. “Yes, it makes sense. They do hate arguing over\nreligion. You must find this discussion terribly boring.”\nA safe out from the conversation. Dalinar smiled, nodding in thanks to\nHatham’s politeness.\n“The Order of Talenelat?” Au-nak said. “I always considered that a\ndevotary for the lesser people.”\n“This from a Natan,” the Ardent said, stuffily.\n“My family has always been devoutly Vorin.”\n“Yes,” the ardent replied, “conveniently so, since your family has used\nits Vorin ties to trade favorably in Alethkar. One wonders if you are equally\ndevout when not standing on our soil.”\n“I don’t have to be insulted like this,” Au-nak snapped.\nHe turned and strode way, causing Hatham to raise a hand. “Nak-ali!”\nHatham called, rushing after him anxiously. “Please, ignore him!”\n“Insufferable bore,” the ardent said softly, taking a sip of his wine—\norange, of course, as he was a man of the clergy.\nDalinar frowned at him. “You are bold, ardent,” he said sternly.\n“Perhaps foolishly so. You insult a man Hatham wants to do business with.”\n“Actually, I belong to Brightlord Hatham,” the ardent said. “He asked\nme to insult his guest—Brightlord Hatham wants Au-nak to think that he is\nshamed. Now, when Hatham agrees quickly to Au-nak’s demands, the\nforeigner will assume it was because of this—and won’t delay the contract\nsigning out of suspicion that it is proceeding too easily.”\nAh, of course. Dalinar looked after the fleeing pair. They go to such\nlengths."

        "text": "signing out of suspicion that it is proceeding too easily.”\nAh, of course. Dalinar looked after the fleeing pair. They go to such\nlengths.\nConsidering that, what was Dalinar to think of Hatham’s politeness\nearlier, when he had given Dalinar a reason to explain his apparent distaste\nfor conflict? Was Hatham preparing Dalinar for some covert manipulation?\nThe ardent cleared his throat. “I would appreciate it if you did not\nrepeat to anyone what I just told you, Brightlord.” Dalinar noticed Adolin\nreturning to the king’s island, accompanied by six of Dalinar’s officers, in\nuniform and wearing their swords.\n“Why did you tell me in the first place, then?” Dalinar asked, turning\nhis attention back to the white-robed man.\n“Just as Hatham wishes his partner in negotiations to know of his\ngoodwill, I wish you to know of our goodwill toward you, Brightlord.”\nDalinar frowned. He’d never had much to do with the ardents—his\ndevotary was simple and straightforward. Dalinar got his fill of politics with\nthe court; he had little desire to find more in religion. “Why? What should it\nmatter if I have goodwill toward you?”\nThe ardent smiled. “We will speak with you again.” He bowed low and\nwithdrew.\nDalinar was about to demand more, but Adolin arrived, looking after\nHighprince Hatham. “What was that all about?”\nDalinar just shook his head. Ardents weren’t supposed to engage in\npolitics, whatever their devotary. They’d been officially forbidden to do so\nsince the Hierocracy. But, as with most things in life, the ideal and the\nreality were two separate things. The lighteyes couldn’t help but use the\nardents in their schemes, and so—more and more—the devotaries found\nthemselves a part of the court.\n“Father?” Adolin asked. “The men are in place.”\n“Good,” Dalinar said. He set his jaw and then crossed the small island.\nHe would see this fiasco finished with, once and for all.\nHe passed the firepit, a wave of dense heat making the left side of his\nface prickle with sweat while the right side was still chilled by the autumn\ncold. Adolin hurried up to walk by him, hand on his side sword. “Father?\nWhat are we doing?”\n“Being provocative,” Dalinar said, striding right up to where Elhokar\nand Sadeas were chatting. Their crowd of sycophants reluctantly parted for\nDalinar.\n“…and I think that—” The king cut off, glancing at Dalinar. “Yes,\nUncle?”\n“Sadeas,” Dalinar said. “What is the status of your investigation of the\ncut girth strap?”\nSadeas blinked. He held a cup of violet wine in his right hand, his\nlong, red velvet robe open at the front to expose a ruffled white shirt.\n“Dalinar, are you—”\n“Your investigation, Sadeas,” Dalinar said firmly.\nSadeas sighed, looking at Elhokar. “Your Majesty. I was actually\nplanning to make an announcement regarding this very subject tonight. I\nwas going to wait until later, but if Dalinar is going to be so insistent…”\n“I am,” Dalinar said."

I\nwas going to wait until later, but if Dalinar is going to be so insistent…”\n“I am,” Dalinar said.\n“Oh, go ahead, Sadeas,” the king said. “You have me curious now.”\nThe king waved to a servant, who rushed to quiet the flutist while another\nservant tapped the chimes to call for silence. In moments, the people on the\nisland stilled.\nSadeas gave Dalinar a grimace that somehow conveyed the message,\n“You demanded this, old friend.”\nDalinar folded his arms, keeping his gaze fixed on Sadeas. His six\nCobalt Guardsmen stepped up behind him, and Dalinar noticed that a group\nof similar lighteyed officers from Sadeas’s warcamp were listening nearby.\n“Well, I wasn’t planning to have such an audience,” Sadeas said.\n“Mostly, this was planned for Your Majesty only.”\nUnlikely, Dalinar thought, trying to suppress his anxiety. What would\nhe do if Adolin was right and Sadeas charged him with trying to assassinate\nElhokar?\nIt would, indeed, be the end of Alethkar. Dalinar would not go quietly,\nand the warcamps would turn against one another. The nervous peace that\nhad held them together for the last decade would come to an end. Elhokar\nwould never be able to hold them together.\nAlso, if it turned to battle, Dalinar would not fare well. The others\nwere alienated from him; he’d have enough trouble facing Sadeas—if\nseveral of the others joined against him, he would fall, horribly\noutnumbered. He could see now Adolin thought it an incredible act of\nfoolishness to have listened to the visions. And yet, in a powerfully surreal\nmoment, Dalinar felt that he’d done the correct thing. He’d never felt it as\nstrongly as at that moment, preparing to be condemned.\n“Sadeas, don’t weary me with your sense of drama,” Elhokar said.\n“They’re listening. I’m listening. Dalinar looks like he’s ready to burst a\nvein in his forehead. Speak.”\n“Very well,” Sadeas said, giving his wine to a servant. “My very first\ntask as Highprince of Information was to discover the true nature of the\nattempt on His Majesty’s life during the greatshell hunt.” He waved a hand,\nmotioning to one of his men, who hurried away. Another stepped forward,\nhanding Sadeas the broken leather strap.\n“I took this strap to three separate leatherworkers in three different\nwarcamps. Each came to the same conclusion. It was cut. The leather is\nrelatively new, and has been well cared for, as proven by the lack of\ncracking and flaking in other areas. The tear is too even. Someone slit it.”\nDalinar felt a sense of dread. That was near what he had discovered,\nbut it was presented in the worst possible light. “For what purpose—”\nDalinar began.\nSadeas held up a hand. “Please, Highprince. First you demand I report,\nthen you interrupt me?”\nDalinar fell still. Around them, more and more of the important light-\neyes were gathering. He could sense their tension."

        "text": "then you interrupt me?”\nDalinar fell still. Around them, more and more of the important light-\neyes were gathering. He could sense their tension.\n“But when was it cut?” Sadeas said, turning to address the crowd. He\ndid have a flair for the dramatic. “That was pivotal, you see. I took leave to\ninterview numerous men who were on that hunt. None reported seeing\nanything specific, though all remembered that there was one odd event. The\ntime when Brightlord Dalinar and His Majesty raced to a rock formation. A\ntime when Dalinar and the king were alone.”\nThere were whispers from behind.\n“There was a problem, however,” Sadeas said. “One Dalinar himself\nraised. Why cut the strap on a Shardbearer’s saddle? A foolish move. A\nhorseback fall wouldn’t be of much danger to a man wearing Shardplate.”\nTo the side, the servant Sadeas had sent away returned, leading a youth with\nsandy hair bearing only a few hints of black.\nSadeas fished something out of a pouch at his waist, holding it up. A\nlarge sapphire. It wasn’t infused. In fact, looking closely, Dalinar could see\nthat it was cracked—it wouldn’t hold Stormlight now. “The question drove\nme to investigate the king’s Shardplate,” Sadeas said. “Eight of the ten\nsapphires used to infuse his Plate were cracked following the battle.”\n“It happens,” Adolin said, stepping up beside Dalinar, hand on his side\nsword. “You lose a few in every battle.”\n“But eight?” Sadeas asked. “One or two is normal. But have you ever\nlost eight in one battle before, young Kholin?”\nAdolin’s only reply was a glare.\nSadeas tucked away the gemstone, nodding to the youth his men had\nbrought. “This is one of the grooms in the king’s employ. Fin, isn’t it?”\n“Y…Yes, brightlord,” the boy stammered. He couldn’t be older than\ntwelve.\n“What is it you told me earlier, Fin? Please, say it again so that all may\nhear.”\nThe darkeyed youth cringed, looking sick. “Well, Brightlord sir, it was\njust this: Everyone spoke of the saddle being checked over in Brightlord\nDalinar’s camp. And I suppose it was, right as that. But I’m the one who\nprepared His Majesty’s horse afore it was turned over to Brightlord\nDalinar’s men. And I did it, I promise I did. Put on his favorite saddle and\neverything. But…”\nDalinar’s heart raced. He had to hold himself back from summoning\nhis Blade.\n“But what?” Sadeas said to Fin.\n“But when the king’s head grooms took the horse past on its way to the\nHighprince Dalinar’s camp, it was wearing a different saddle. I swear it.”\nSeveral of those standing around them seemed confused by this\nadmission.\n“Aha!” Adolin said, pointing. “But that happened in the king’s palace\ncomplex!”\n“Indeed,” Sadeas said, raising an eyebrow at Adolin. “How keen-\nminded of you, young Kholin. This discovery—mixed with the cracked\ngemstones—means something. I suspect that whoever attempted to kill His"

I suspect that whoever attempted to kill His\nMajesty planted in his Shardplate flawed gemstones that would crack when\nstrained, losing their Stormlight. Then they weakened the saddle girth with\na careful slit. The hope would be that His Majesty would fall while fighting\na great-shell, allowing it to attack him. The gemstones would fail, the Plate\nwould break, and His Majesty would fall to an ‘accident’ while hunting.”\nSadeas raised a finger as the crowd began to whisper again. “However,\nit is important to realize that these events—the switching of the saddle or\nthe planting of the gemstones—must have happened before His Majesty\nmet up with Dalinar. I feel that Dalinar is a very unlikely suspect. In fact,\nmy present guess is that the culprit is someone that Brightlord Dalinar has\noffended; that someone wanted us all to think he might be involved. It may\nnot have actually been intended to kill His Majesty, just to cast suspicion\nupon Dalinar.”\nThe island fell silent, even the whispers dying.\nDalinar stood, stunned. I…I was right!\nAdolin finally broke the quiet. “What?”\n“All evidence points to your father being innocent, Adolin,” Sadeas\nsaid sufferingly. “You find this surprising?”\n“No, but…” Adolin’s brow furrowed.\nAround them, the lighteyes began talking, sounding disappointed.\nThey began to disperse. Dalinar’s officers remained standing behind him, as\nif expecting a surprise strike.\nBlood of my fathers… Dalinar thought. What does it mean?\nSadeas waved for his men to take the groom away, then nodded to\nElhokar and withdrew in the direction of the evening trays, where warmed\nwine sat in pitchers next to toasted breads. Dalinar caught up to Sadeas as\nthe shorter man was filling a small plate. Dalinar took him by the arm, the\nfabric of Sadeas’s robe soft beneath his fingers.\nSadeas looked at him, raising an eyebrow.\n“Thank you,” Dalinar said quietly. “For not going through with it.”\nBehind them, the flutist resumed her playing.\n“For not going through with what?” Sadeas said, setting down his\nsmall plate, then prying Dalinar’s fingers free. “I had hoped to make this\npresentation after I’d discovered more concrete proof that you weren’t\ninvolved. Unfortunately, pressed as I was, the best I could do was to\nindicate that it was unlikely you were involved. There will still be rumors,\nI’m afraid.”\n“Wait. You wanted to prove me innocent?”\nSadeas scowled, picking up his plate again. “Do you know what your\nproblem is, Dalinar? Why everyone has begun finding you so tiresome?”\nDalinar didn’t reply.\n“The presumption. You’ve grown despicably self-righteous. Yes, I\nasked Elhokar for this position so I could prove you innocent. Is it so\nstorming difficult for you to believe someone else in this army might do\nsomething honest?”\n“I…” Dalinar said.\n“Of course it is,” Sadeas said. “You’ve been looking down on us like a\nman standing atop a single sheet of paper, who therefore thinks himself so"

Well, I think that book of Gavilar’s is crem, and the\nCodes are lies people pretended to follow so that they could justify their\nshriveled consciences. Damnation, I’ve got one of those shriveled\nconsciences myself. But I didn’t want to see you maligned for this bungled\nattempt to kill the king. If you’d wanted him dead, you’d have just burned\nout his eyes and been done with it!”\nSadeas took a drink of his steaming violet wine. “The problem is,\nElhokar kept on and on about that blasted strap. And people started talking,\nsince he was under your protection and you two rode off together like that.\nStormfather only knows how they could think you would try to have\nElhokar assassinated. You can barely bring yourself to kill Parshendi these\ndays.” Sadeas stuffed a small piece of toasted bread in his mouth, then\nmoved to walk away.\nDalinar caught him by the arm again. “I…I owe you a debt. I shouldn’t\nhave treated you as I have these six years.”\nSadeas rolled his eyes, chewing his bread. “This wasn’t for you alone.\nSo long as everyone thought you were behind the attempt, nobody would\nfigure out who really tried to have Elhokar killed. And someone did,\nDalinar. I don’t accept eight gemstones cracking in one fight. The strap\nalone would have been a ridiculous way to attempt an assassination, but\nwith weakened Shardplate…I’m half tempted to believe that the surprise\narrival of the chasmfiend was orchestrated too. How someone would\nmanage that though, I have no idea.”\n“And the talk of me being framed?” Dalinar asked.\n“Mostly to give the others something to gossip about while I sort\nthrough what’s really happening.” Sadeas looked down at Dalinar’s hand on\nhis arm. “Would you let go?”\nDalinar released his grip.\nSadeas set down his plate, straightening his robe and dusting off the\nshoulder. “I haven’t give up on you yet, Dalinar. I’m probably going to need\nyou before this is all through. I do have to say, though, I don’t know what to\nmake of you lately. That talk of you wanting to abandon the Vengeance\nPact. Is there any truth to that?”\n“I mentioned it, in confidence, to Elhokar as a means of exploring\noptions. So yes, there’s truth to it, if you must know. I’m tired of this\nfighting. I’m tired of these Plains, of being away from civilization, of killing\nParshendi a handful at a time. However, I’ve given up on getting us to\nretreat. Instead, I want to win. But the highprinces won’t listen! They all\nassume that I’m trying to dominate them with some crafty trick.”\nSadeas snorted. “You’d sooner punch a man in the face than stab him\nin the back. Blessedly straightforward.”\n“Ally with me,” Dalinar said after him.\nSadeas froze."

Try what I’ve been trying to get the other\nhighprinces to agree to. Jointly assault plateaus with me.”\n“Won’t work,” Sadeas said. “There’s no reason to bring more than one\narmy on an assault. I leave half my troops behind each time as it is. There\nisn’t room for more to maneuver.”\n“Yes, but think,” Dalinar said. “What if we tried new tactics? Your\nquick bridge crews are fast, but my troops are stronger. What if you pushed\nquickly to a plateau with an advance force to hold off the Parshendi? You\ncould hold until my stronger, but slower, forces arrive.”\nThat gave Sadeas pause.\n“It could mean a Shardblade, Sadeas.”\nSadeas’s eyes grew hungry.\n“I know you’ve fought Parshendi Shardbearers,” Dalinar said, seizing\non that thread, “But you’ve lost. Without a Blade, you’re at a\ndisadvantage.” Parshendi Shardbearers had a habit of escaping after\nentering battles. Regular spearmen couldn’t kill one, of course. It took a\nShardbearer to kill a Shardbearer. “I’ve slain two in the past. I don’t often\nhave the opportunity, however, because I can’t get to the plateaus quickly\nenough. You can. Together, we can win more often, and I can get you a\nBlade. We can do this, Sadeas. Together. Like the old days.”\n“The old days,” he said idly. “I’d like to see the Blackthorn in battle\nagain. How would we split the gemhearts?”\n“Two-thirds to you,” Dalinar said. “As you’ve got twice as good a\nrecord at winning assaults as I have.”\nSadeas looked thoughtful. “And the Shardblades?”\n“If we find a Shardbearer, Adolin and I will take him. You win the\nBlade.” He raised a finger. “But I win the Plate. To give to my son,\nRenarin.”\n“The invalid?”\n“What would you care?” Dalinar said. “You already have Plate.\nSadeas, this could mean winning the war. If we start to work together, we\ncould bring the others in, prepare for a large-scale assault. Storms! We\nmight not even need that. We two have the largest armies; if we could find a\nway to catch the Parshendi on a large enough plateau with the bulk of our\ntroops—surrounding them so they couldn’t escape—we might be able to\ndamage their forces enough to bring an end to this all.”\nSadeas mulled it over. Then he shrugged. “Very well. Send me details\nvia messenger. But do it later. I’ve already missed too much of tonight’s\nfeast.”\n“A woman sits and scratches out her own eyes.

Subject: a beggar of\nsome renown, known for his elegant songs.\nOne week after losing Dunny, Kaladin stood on another plateau, watching a\nbattle proceed. This time, however, he didn’t have to save the dying. They’d\nactually arrived before the Parshendi. A rare but welcome event. Sadeas’s\narmy was now holding out at the center of the plateau, protecting the\nchrysalis while some of his soldiers cut into it.\nThe Parshendi kept leaping over the line and attacking the men\nworking on the chrysalis. He’s getting surrounded, Kaladin thought. It\ndidn’t look good, which would mean a miserable return trip. Sadeas’s men\nwere bad enough when, arriving second, they were rebuffed. Losing the\ngemheart after arriving first…would leave them even more frustrated.\n“Kaladin!” a voice said. Kaladin spun to see Rock trotting up. Was\nsomeone wounded? “Have you seen this thing?” The Horneater pointed.\nKaladin turned, following his gesture. Another army was approaching\non an adjacent plateau. Kaladin raised eyebrows; the banners flapped blue,\nand the soldiers were obviously Alethi.\n“A little late, aren’t they?” Moash asked, standing beside Kaladin.\n“It happens,” Kaladin said. Occasionally another highprince would\narrive after Sadeas got to the plateau. More often, Sadeas arrived first, and\nthe other Alethi army had to turn around. Usually they didn’t get this close\nbefore doing so.\n“That’s the standard of Dalinar Kholin,” Skar said, joining them.\n“Dalinar,” Moash said appreciatively. “They say he doesn’t use\nbridgemen.”\n“How does he cross the chasms, then?” Kaladin asked.\nThe answer soon became obvious. This new army had enormous,\nsiege-tower-like bridges pulled by chulls. They rumbled across the uneven\nplateaus, often having to pick their way around rifts in the stone. They must\nbe terribly slow, Kaladin thought. But, in trade, the army wouldn’t have to\napproach the chasm while being fired on. They could hide behind those\nbridges.\n“Dalinar Kholin,” Moash said. “They say he’s a true lighteyes, like the\nmen from the old days. A man of honor and of oaths.”\nKaladin snorted. “I’ve seen plenty of lighteyes with that same\nreputation, and I’ve been disappointed by them every time. I’ll tell you\nabout Brightlord Amaram sometime.”\n“Amaram?” Skar asked. “The Shardbearer?”\n“You’ve heard of that?” Kaladin asked.\n“Sure,” Skar said. “He’s supposed to be on his way here. Everyone’s\ntalking about it in the taverns. Were you with him when he won his\nShards?”\n“No,” Kaladin said softly. “Nobody was.”\nDalinar Kholin’s army approached across the plateau to the south.\nAmazingly, Dalinar’s army came right up to the battlefield plateau.\n“He’s attacking?” Moash said, scratching his head. “Maybe he figures"

A group\nof soldiers unhooked the bridges and pushed them into place while\nDalinar’s archers set up and exchanged fire with the Parshendi.\n“Does it seem Sadeas took fewer soldiers with him this run?” Sigzil\nasked, joining the group watching Dalinar’s army. “Perhaps he planned for\nthis. Could be why he was willing to commit like he did, letting himself get\nsurrounded.”\nThe bridges could be cranked to lower and extend; there was some\nmarvelous engineering at work. As they began to work, something\ndecidedly strange happened: Two Shardbearers, likely Dalinar and his son,\nleaped across the chasm and began attacking the Parshendi. The distraction\nlet the soldiers get the large bridges into place, and some heavy cavalry\ncharged across to help. It was a completely different method of doing a\nbridge assault, and Kaladin found himself considering the implications.\n“He really is joining the battle,” Moash said. “I think they’re going to\nwork together.”\n“It’s bound to be more effective,” Kaladin said. “I’m surprised they\nhaven’t tried it before.”\nTeft snorted. “That’s because you don’t understand how lighteyes\nthink. Highprinces don’t just want to win the battle, they want to win it by\nthemselves.”\n“I wish I’d been recruited in his army instead,” Moash said, almost\nreverent. The soldiers’ armor gleamed, their ranks obviously well-practiced.\nDalinar—the Blackthorn—had done an even better job than Amaram at\ncultivating a reputation for honesty. People knew of him all the way back in\nHearthstone, but Kaladin understood the kinds of corruption a well-polished\nbreastplate could hide.\nThough, he thought, that man who protected the whore on the street, he\nwore blue. Adolin, Dalinar’s son. He seemed genuinely selfless in his\ndefense of the woman.\nKaladin set his jaw, casting aside those thoughts. He would not be\ntaken in again.\nHe would not.\nThe fighting grew brutal for a short time, but the Parshendi were\noverwhelmed—smashed between two opposing forces. Soon, Kaladin’s\nteam led a victorious group of soldiers back to the camps for celebration.\nKaladin rolled the sphere between his fingers. The otherwise pure glass had\ncooled with a thin line of bubbles permanently frozen along one side. The\nbubbles were tiny spheres of their own, catching light.\nHe was on chasm scavenging duty. They’d gotten back from the\nplateau assault so quickly that Hashal, in defiance of logic or mercy, had\nsent them down into the chasm that very day.

Hanging in the very center of it was a large emerald\ncut in a round shape, with dozens of tiny facets along the sides. A small rim\nof suspended bubbles clung to the side of gemstone, as if longing to be near\nits brilliance.\nBright, crystalline green Stormlight shone from inside the glass,\nlighting Kaladin’s fingers. An emerald broam, the highest denomination of\nsphere. Worth hundreds of lesser spheres. To bridgemen, this was a fortune.\nA strangely distant one, for spending it was impossible. Kaladin thought he\ncould see some of the storm’s tempest inside that rock. The light was like…\nit was like part of the storm, captured by the emerald. The light wasn’t\nperfectly steady; it just seemed that way compared with the flickering of\ncandles, torches, or lamps. Holding it close, Kaladin could see the light\nswirling, raging.\n“What do we do with it?” Moash asked from Kaladin’s side. Rock\nstood at Kaladin’s other side. The sky was overcast, making it darker than\nusual here at the bottom. The cold weather of late had drawn back to spring,\nthough it was uncomfortably chilly.\nThe men worked efficiently, quickly gathering spears, armor, boots,\nand spheres from the dead. Because of the short time given them—and\nbecause of the exhausting bridge run earlier—Kaladin had decided to forgo\nspear practice for the day. They’d load up on salvage instead and stow some\nof it down beneath, to be used for avoiding punishment next time.\nAs they’d worked, they’d found a lighteyed officer. He had been quite\nwealthy. This single emerald broam was worth what a bridgeman slave\nwould make in two hundred days. In the same pouch with it, they’d found a\ncollection of chips and marks that totaled slightly more than another\nemerald broam. Wealth. A fortune. Simply pocket change to a lighteyes.\n“With this we could feed those wounded bridgemen for months,”\nMoash said. “We could buy all the medical supplies we could want.\nStormfather! We could probably bribe the camp’s perimeter guards to let us\nsneak away.’\n“This thing will not happen,” Rock said. “Is impossible to get spheres\nout of the chasms.”\n“We could swallow them,” Moash said.\n“You would choke. Spheres are too big, eh?”\n“I’ll bet I could do it,” Moash said. His eyes glittered, reflecting the\nverdant Stormlight. “That’s more money than I’ve ever seen. It’s worth the\nrisk.”\n“Swallowing won’t work,” Kaladin said. “You think those guards who\nwatch us in the latrines are there to keep us from fleeing? I’ll bet some\nsodden parshman has to go through our droppings, and I’ve seen them keep\nrecord of who visits and how often. We aren’t the first to think of\nswallowing spheres.”\nMoash hesitated, then sighed, crestfallen. “You’re probably right.\nStorm you, but you are. But we can’t just give it to them, can we?”\n“Yes, we can,” Kaladin said, closing his fist around the sphere. The"

        "text": "Storm you, but you are. But we can’t just give it to them, can we?”\n“Yes, we can,” Kaladin said, closing his fist around the sphere. The\nglow was bright enough to make his hand shine. “We’d never be able to\nspend it. A bridgeman with a full broam? It would give us away.”\n“But—” Moash began.\n“We give it to them, Moash.” Then he held up the pouch containing the\nother spheres. “But we find a way to keep these.”\nRock nodded. “Yes. If we give up this expensive sphere, they will\nthink us honest, eh? It will disguise the theft, and they will even give us\nsmall reward. But how can we do this thing, keeping the pouch?”\n“I’m working on that,” Kaladin said.\n“Work fast, then,” Moash said, glancing at Kaladin’s torch, rammed\nbetween two rocks at the side of the chasm. “We’ll need to head back up\nsoon.”\nKaladin opened his hand and rolled the emerald sphere between his\nfingers. How? “Have you ever seen anything so beautiful?” Moash asked,\nstaring at the emerald.\n“It’s just a sphere,” Kaladin said absently. “A tool. I once held a goblet\nfull of a hundred diamond broams and was told they were mine. Since I\nnever got to spend them, they were as good as worthless.”\n“A hundred diamonds?” Moash asked. “Where…how?”\nKaladin closed his mouth, cursing himself. I shouldn’t keep mentioning\nthings like that. “Go on,” he said, tucking the emerald broam back into the\nblack pouch. “We need to be quick.”\nMoash sighed, but Rock thumped him on the back good-naturedly and\nthey joined the rest of the bridgemen. Rock and Lopen—using Syl’s\ndirections—had led them to a large mass of corpses in red-and-brown\nuniforms. He didn’t know which highprince’s men they were, but the bodies\nwere pretty fresh. There were no Parshendi among them.\nKaladin glanced to the side, where Shen—the parshman bridgeman—\nworked. Quiet, obedient, stalwart. Teft still didn’t trust him. A part of\nKaladin was glad for that. Syl landed on the wall beside him, standing with\nher feet planted against the surface and looking up at the sky.\nThink, Kaladin told himself. How do we keep these spheres? There has\nto be a way. But each possibility seemed too much of a risk. If they were\ncaught stealing, they’d probably be given a different work detail. Kaladin\nwasn’t willing to risk that.\nSilent green lifespren began to fade into existence around him,\nbobbing around the moss and haspers. A few frillblooms opened up fronds\nof red and yellow beside his head. Kaladin had thought again and again\nabout Dunny’s death. Bridge Four was not safe. True, they’d lost a\nremarkably small number of men lately, but they were still dwindling. And\neach bridge run was a chance for total disaster. All it took was one time,\nwith the Parshendi focusing on them. Lose three or four men, and they’d\ntopple. The waves of arrows would redouble, cutting every one of them"

The waves of arrows would redouble, cutting every one of them\ndown.\nIt was the same old problem, the one Kaladin had beaten his head\nagainst day after day. How did you protect bridgemen when everyone\nwanted them exposed and endangered?\n“Hey Sig,” Maps said, walking by carrying an armload of spears.\n“You’re a Worldsinger, right?” Maps had grown increasingly friendly in the\nlast few weeks, and had proven good at getting the others talking. The\nbalding man reminded Kaladin of an innkeeper, always quick to make his\npatrons feel at ease.\nSigzil—who was pulling the boots off a line of corpses—gave Kaladin\na straight-lipped glance that seemed to say, “This is your fault.” He didn’t\nlike that others had discovered he was a Worldsinger.\n“Why don’t you give us a tale?” Maps said, setting down his armload.\n“Help us pass the time.”\n“I am not a foolish jester or storyteller,” Sigzil said, yanking off a boot.\n“I do not ‘give tales.’ I spread knowledge of cultures, peoples, thoughts, and\ndreams. I bring peace through understanding. It is the holy charge my order\nreceived from the Heralds themselves.”\n“Well why not start spreading then?” Maps said, standing and wiping\nhis hands on his trousers.\nSigzil signed audibly. “Very well. What is it you wish to hear about?”\n“I don’t know. Something interesting.”\n“Tell us about Brightking Alazansi and the hundred-ship fleet,” Leyten\ncalled.\n“I am not a storyteller!” Sigzil repeated. “I speak of nations and\npeoples, not tavern stories. I—”\n“Is there a place where people live in gouges in the ground?” Kaladin\nsaid. “A city built in an enormous complex of lines, all set into the rock as if\ncarved there?”\n“Sesemalex Dar,” Sigzil said, nodding, pulling off another boot. “Yes,\nit is the capital of the kingdom of Emul, and is one of the most ancient cities\nin the world. It is said that the city—and, indeed, the kingdom—were\nnamed by Jezrien himself.”\n“Jezrien?” Malop said, standing and scratching his head. “Who’s\nthat?” Malop was a thick-haired fellow with a bushy black beard and a\nglyphward tattoo on each hand. He also wasn’t the brightest sphere in the\ngoblet, so to speak.\n“You call him the Stormfather, here in Alethkar,” Sigzil said. “Or\nJezerezeh’Elin. He was king of the Heralds. Master of the storms, bringer of\nwater and life, known for his fury and his temper, but also for his mercy.”\n“Oh,” Malop said.\n“Tell me more of the city,” Kaladin said.\n“Sesemalex Dar. It is, indeed, built in giant troughs. The pattern is\nquite amazing. It protects against highstorms, as each trough has a lip at the\nside, keeping water from streaming in off the stone plain around it. That,\nmixed with a drainage system of cracks, protects the city from flooding."

That,\nmixed with a drainage system of cracks, protects the city from flooding.\n“The people there are known for their expert crem pottery; the city is a\nmajor waypoint in the southwest. The Emuli are a certain tribe of the\nAskarki people, and they’re ethnically Makabaki—dark-skinned, like\nmyself. Their kingdom borders my own, and I visited there many times in\nmy youth.\n“It is a wondrous place, filled with exotic travelers.” Sigzil grew more\nrelaxed as he continued to talk. “Their legal system is very lenient toward\nforeigners. A man who is not of their nationality cannot own a home or\nshop, but when you visit, you are treated as a ‘relative who has traveled\nfrom afar, to be shown all kindness and leniency.’ A foreigner can take\ndinner at any residence he calls upon, assuming he is respectful and offers a\ngift of fruit. The people are most interested in exotic fruits. They worship\nJezrien, though they don’t accept him as a figure from the Vorin religion.\nThey name him the only god.”\n“The Heralds aren’t gods,” Teft scoffed.\n“To you they aren’t,” Sigzil said. “Others regard them differently. The\nEmuli have what your scholars like to call a splinter religion—containing\nsome Vorin ideas. But to the Emuli, you would be the splinter religion.”\nSigzil seemed to find that amusing, though Teft just scowled.\nSigzil continued in more and more detail, talking of the flowing gowns\nand head-wraps of the Emuli women, the robes favored by the men. The\ntaste of the food—salty—and the way of greeting an old friend—by holding\nthe left forefinger to the forehead and bowing in respect. Sigzil knew an\nimpressive amount about them. Kaladin noticed him smiling wistfully at\ntimes, probably recalling his travels.\nThe details were interesting, but Kaladin was more taken aback by the\nfact that this city—which he had flown over in his dream weeks ago—was\nactually real. And he could no longer ignore the strange speed at which he\nrecovered from wounds. Something odd was happening to him. Something\nsupernatural. What if it was related to the fact that everyone around him\nalways seemed to die?\nHe knelt down to begin rifling the pockets of the dead men, a duty the\nother bridgemen avoided. Spheres, knives, and other useful objects were\nkept. Personal mementoes like unburned prayers were left with the bodies.\nHe found a few zircon chips, which he added to the pouch.\nMaybe Moash was right. If they could get this money out, could they\nbribe their way free of the camp? That would certainly be safer than\nfighting. So why was he so insistent on teaching the bridgemen to fight?\nWhy hadn’t he given any thought to sneaking the bridgemen out?\nHe had lost Dallet and the others of his original squad in Amaram’s\narmy. Did he think to compensate for that by training a new group of\nspearmen? Was this about saving men he’d grown to love, or was it just\nabout proving something to himself?"

Was this about saving men he’d grown to love, or was it just\nabout proving something to himself?\nHis experience told him that men who could not fight were at a severe\ndisadvantage in this world of war and storms. Perhaps sneaking out would\nhave been the better option, but he knew little of stealth. Besides, if they\nsneaked away, Sadeas would send troops after them. Trouble would track\nthem down. Whatever their path, the bridgemen would have to kill to\nremain free.\nHe squeezed his eyes shut, remembering one of his escape attempts,\nwhen he’d kept his fellow slaves free for an entire week, hiding in the\nwilderness. They’d finally been caught by their master’s hunters. That was\nwhen he’d lost Nalma. None of that has to do with saving them here and\nnow, Kaladin told himself. I need these spheres.\nSigzil was still talking about the Emuli. “To them,” the Worldsinger\nsaid, “the need to strike a man personally is crass. They wage war in the\nopposite way from you Alethi. The sword is not a weapon for a leader. A\nhalberd is better, then a spear, and best of all a bow and arrow.”\nKaladin pulled another handful of spheres—skychips—from a\nsoldier’s pocket. They were stuck to an aged hunk of sow’s cheese, fragrant\nand moldy. He grimaced, picking the spheres out and washing them in a\npuddle.\n“Spears, used by lighteyes?” Drehy said. “That’s ridiculous.”\n“Why?” Sigzil said, sounding offended. “I find the Emuli way to be\ninteresting. In some countries, it is seen as displeasing to fight at all. To the\nShin, for instance, if you must fight a man, then you have already failed.\nKilling is, at best, a brutish way of solving problems.”\n“You’re not going be like Rock and refuse to fight, are you?” Skar\nasked, shooting a barely-veiled glare at the Horneater. Rock sniffed and\nturned his back on the shorter man, kneeling down to shove boots into a\nlarge sack.\n“No,” Sigzil said. “I think we can all agree that other methods have\nfailed. Perhaps if my master knew I still lived…but no. That is foolish. Yes,\nI will fight. And if I have to, the spear seems a favorable weapon, though I\nhonestly would prefer to put more distance between myself and my\nenemies.”\nKaladin frowned. “You mean with a bow?”\nSigzil nodded. “Among my people, the bow is a noble weapon.”\n“Do you know how to use one?”\n“Alas, no,” Sigzil said. “I would have mentioned it before now if I had\nsuch proficiency.”\nKaladin stood up, opening the pouch and depositing the spheres in\nwith the others. “Were there any bows among the bodies?”\nThe men glanced at each other, several of them shaking heads. Storm\nit, Kaladin thought. The seed of an idea had begun to sprout in his mind, but\nthat killed it.\n“Gather up some of those spears,” he said. “Set them aside. We’ll need\nthem for training.”"

It shouldn’t take long to gather enough to practice with.”\n“How will we get them out when it’s time to escape?” Teft asked,\nrubbing his chin. “Spears left down here won’t do these lads much good\nonce the real fighting starts.”\n“I’ll find a way to get them up,” Kaladin said.\n“You say things like that a lot,” Skar noted.\n“Leave off, Skar,” Moash said. “He knows what he’s doing.”\nKaladin blinked. Had Moash just defended him?\nSkar flushed. “I didn’t mean it like that, Kaladin. I’m just asking, that’s\nall.”\n“I understand. It’s…” Kaladin trailed off as Syl flitted down into the\nchasm in the form of a curling ribbon.\nShe landed on a rock outcropping on the wall, taking on her female\nform. “I found another group of bodies. They’re mostly Parshendi.”\n“Any bows?” Kaladin asked. Several of the bridgemen gawked at him\nuntil they saw him staring into the air. Then they nodded knowingly to one\nanother.\n“I think so,” Syl said. “It’s just down this way. Not too far.”\nThe bridgemen had mostly finished with these bodies. “Gather up the\nthings,” Kaladin said. “I’ve found us another place to scavenge. We need to\ngather as much as we can, then stash some in a chasm where it has a good\nchance of not being washed away.”\nThe bridgemen picked up their findings, slinging sacks over their\nshoulders and each man hefting a spear or two. Within moments, they\nheaded down the dank chasm bottom, following Syl. They passed clefts in\nthe ancient rock walls where old, storm-washed bones had gotten lodged,\ncreating a mound of moss-covered femurs, tibia, skulls, and ribs. There\nwasn’t much salvage among them.\nAfter about a quarter-hour, they came to the place Syl had found. A\nscattered group of Parshendi dead lay in heaps, mixed with the occasional\nAlethi in blue. Kaladin knelt beside one of the human bodies. He\nrecognized Dalinar Kholin’s stylized glyphpair sewn on the coat. Why had\nDalinar’s army joined Sadeas’s in battle? What had changed?\nKaladin pointed for the men to begin scavenging from the Alethi while\nhe walked over to one of the Parshendi corpses. It was much fresher than\nDalinar’s man. They didn’t find nearly as many Parshendi corpses as they\ndid Alethi. Not only were there fewer of them in any given battle, but they\nwere less likely to fall to their deaths into the chasms. Sigzil also guessed\nthat their bodies were more dense than human ones, and didn’t float or wash\naway as easily."

Kaladin turned to see Shen\npushing forward in an uncharacteristic display of passion.\nTeft moved quickly, grabbing Shen from behind, placing him in a\nchoke hold. The other bridgemen stood, aghast, though several fell into\ntheir stances by reflex.\nShen struggled weakly against Teft’s grip. The parshman looked\ndifferent from his dead cousins; close together, the differences were much\nmore obvious. Shen—like most parshmen—was short and a little plump.\nStout, strong, but not threatening. The corpse at Kaladin’s feet, however,\nwas muscled and built like a Horneater, easily as tall as Kaladin and far\nbroader at the shoulders. While both had the marbled skin, the Parshendi\nhad those strange, deep-red growths of armor on the head, chest, arms, and\nlegs.\n“Let him go,” Kaladin said, curious.\nTeft glanced at him, then reluctantly did as commanded. Shen\nscrambled over the uneven ground and gently, but firmly, pushed Kaladin\naway from the corpse. Shen stood back, as if protecting it from Kaladin.\n“This thing,” Rock noted, stepping up beside Kaladin, “he has done it\nbefore. When Lopen and I take him scavenging.”\n“He’s protective of the Parshendi bodies, gancho,” Lopen added. “Like\nhe’d stab you a hundred times for moving one, sure.”\n“They’re all like that,” Sigzil said from behind.\nKaladin turned, raising an eyebrow.\n“Parshman workers,” Sigzil explained. “They’re allowed to care for\ntheir own dead; it’s one of the few things they seem passionate about. They\ngrow irate if anyone else handles the bodies. They wrap them in linen and\ncarry them out into the wilderness and leave them on slabs of stone.”\nKaladin regarded Shen. I wonder….\n“Scavenge from the Parshendi,” Kaladin said to his men. “Teft, you’ll\nprobably have to hold Shen the whole time. I can’t have him trying to stop\nus.”\nTeft shot Kaladin a suffering glance; he still thought they should set\nShen at the front of the bridge and let him die. But he did as told, pushing\nShen away and getting Moash’s help to hold him.\n“And men,” Kaladin noted. “be respectful of the dead.”\n“They’re Parshendi!” Leyten objected.\n“I know,” Kaladin said. “But it bothers Shen. He’s one of us, so let’s\nkeep his irritation to a minimum.”\nThe parshman lowered his arms reluctantly and let Teft and Moash\npull him away. He seemed resigned. Parshmen were slow of thought. How\nmuch did Shen comprehend?\n“Didn’t you wish to find a bow?” Sigzil asked, kneeling and slipping a\nhorned Parshendi shortbow out from underneath a body. “The bowstring is\ngone.”\n“There’s another in this fellow’s pouch,” Maps said, pulling something"

Bows were useless for hunting\nmost shellbeasts; slings worked far better. The bow was really only good for\nkilling other men. Kaladin glanced at Teft, who shook his head. He hadn’t\nbeen trained on a bow; neither had Kaladin.\n“Is simple,” Rock said, rolling over a Parshendi corpse, “put arrow on\nstring. Point away from self. Pull very hard. Let go.”\n“I doubt it will be that easy,” Kaladin said.\n“We barely have time to train the lads in the spear, Kaladin,” Teft said.\n“You mean to teach some of them the bow as well? And without a teacher\nwho can use one himself?”\nKaladin didn’t respond. He tucked the bow and string away in his bag,\nadded a few arrows, then helped the others. An hour later, they marched\nthrough the chasms toward the ladder, their torches sputtering, dusk\napproaching. The darker it grew, the more unpleasant the chasms became.\nShadows deepened, and distant sounds—water dripping, rocks falling, wind\ncalling—took on an ominous cast. Kaladin rounded a corner, and a group of\nmany-legged cremlings scuttling along the wall and slipped into a fissure.\nConversation was subdued, and Kaladin didn’t take part. Occasionally,\nhe glanced over his shoulder toward Shen. The silent parshman walked\nhead down. Robbing the Parshendi corpses had seriously disturbed him.\nI can use that, Kaladin thought. But dare I? It would be a risk. A great\none. He had already been sentenced once for upsetting the balance of the\nchasm battles.\nFirst the spheres, he thought. Getting the spheres out would mean he\nmight be able to get out other items. Eventually he saw a shadow above,\nspanning the chasm. They had reached the first of the permanent bridges.\nKaladin walked with the others a little further, until they reached a place\nwhere the chasm floor was closer to the top of the plateaus above.\nHe stopped here. The bridgemen gathered around him.\n“Sigzil,” Kaladin said, pointing. “You know something about bows.\nHow hard do you think it would be to hit that bridge with an arrow?”\n“I’ve occasionally held a bow, Kaladin, but I would not call myself an\nexpert. It shouldn’t be too hard, I’d imagine. The distance is what, fifty\nfeet?”\n“What’s the point?” Moash asked.\nKaladin pulled out the pouch full of spheres, then raised an eyebrow at\nthem. “We tie the bag to the arrow, then launch it up so that it sticks to the\nbottom of the bridge. Then when we’re on a bridge run, Lopen and Dabbid\ncan hang back to get a drink near that bridge up there. They reach under the\nwood and pull the arrow off. We get the spheres.”\nTeft whistled. “Clever.”"

We get the spheres.”\nTeft whistled. “Clever.”\n“We could get all of the spheres,” Moash said eagerly. “Even the—”\n“No,” Kaladin said firmly. “The lesser ones will be dangerous enough;\npeople might begin wondering where bridgemen are getting so much\nmoney.” He would have to buy his supplies from several different\napothecaries to hide his influx of money.\nMoash looked crestfallen, but the other bridgemen were eager. “Who\nwants to try?” Kaladin asked. “Maybe we should shoot a few practice shots\nfirst, then try with the bag. Sigzil?”\n“I don’t know if I want this on me,” Sigzil said. “Maybe you should\ntry, Teft.”\nTeft rubbed his chin. “Sure. I guess. How hard can it be?”\n“How hard?” Rock asked suddenly.\nKaladin glanced to the side. Rock stood at the back of the group,\nthough his height made him easy to see. He had his arms folded.\n“How hard, Teft?” Rock continued. “Fifty feet is not too far, but is not\neasy shot. And to do it with bag of heavy spheres tied to it? Ha! You also\nneed to get arrow close to side of bridge, so Lopen can reach. If you miss\nwith this thing, you could lose all spheres. And what if scouts near bridges\nabove see arrow come from chasm? Will think it suspicious, eh?”\nKaladin eyed the Horneater. Is simple, he’d said. Point away from\nself…let go…\n“Well,” Kaladin said, watching Rock from the corner of his eye. “I\nguess we’ll just have to take that chance. Without these spheres, the\nwounded die.”\n“We could wait until the next bridge run,” Teft said. “Tie a rope to the\nbridge and toss it over, then tie the bag to it next time….”\n“Fifty feet of rope?” Kaladin said flatly. “It would draw enough\nattention to buy something like that.”\n“Nah, gancho,” Lopen said. “I have a cousin who works in a place that\nsells rope. I could get some for you easy, with money.”\n“Perhaps,” Kaladin said. “But you’d still have to hide it in the litter,\nthen hang it down into the chasm without anyone seeing. And to leave it\ndangling there for several days? It would be noticed.”\nThe others nodded. Rock seemed very uncomfortable. Sighing,\nKaladin took out the bow and several arrows. “We’ll just have to chance\nthis. Teft, why don’t you…”\n“Oh, Kali’kalin’s ghost,” Rock muttered. “Here, give me bow.” He\nshoved his way through the bridgemen, taking the bow from Kaladin.\nKaladin hid a smile.\nRock glanced upward, judging the distance in the waning light. He\nstrung the bowstring, then held out a hand. Kaladin handed him an arrow.\nHe leveled the bow back down the chasm and launched. The arrow flew\nswiftly, clattering against chasm walls.\nRock nodded to himself, then pointed at Kaladin’s pouch. “We take"

The arrow flew\nswiftly, clattering against chasm walls.\nRock nodded to himself, then pointed at Kaladin’s pouch. “We take\nonly five spheres,” Rock said. “Any more would be too heavy. Is crazy to\ntry with even five. Airsick lowlanders.”\nKaladin smiled, then counted out five sapphire marks—together about\ntwo and a half months’ worth of pay for a bridgeman—and placed them in a\nspare pouch. He handed that to Rock, who pulled out a knife and dug\na notch into an arrow’s wood next to the arrowhead.\nSkar folded his arms and leaned against the mossy wall. “This is\nstealing, you know.”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said, watching Rock. “And I don’t feel the least bit bad\nabout it. Do you?”\n“Not at all,” Skar said, grinning. “I figure once someone is trying to\nget you killed, all expectations of your loyalty are tossed to the storm. But if\nsomeone were to go to Gaz…”\nThe other bridgemen suddenly grew nervous, and more than a few\neyes darted toward Shen, though Kaladin could see that Skar wasn’t\nthinking of the Parshman. If one of the bridgemen were to betray the rest of\nthem, he might earn himself a reward.\n“Maybe we should post a watch,” Drehy said. “You know, make sure\nnobody sneaks off to talk to Gaz.”\n“We’ll do no such thing,” Kaladin said. “What are we going to do?\nLock ourselves in the barrack, so suspicious of each other that we never get\nanything done?” He shook his head. “No. This is just one more danger. It’s\na real one, but we can’t waste energy spying on each other. So we keep on\ngoing.”\nSkar didn’t look convinced.\n“We’re Bridge Four,” Kaladin said firmly. “We’ve faced death\ntogether. We have to trust each other. You can’t run into battle wondering if\nyour companions are going to switch sides suddenly.” He met the eyes of\neach man in turn. “I trust you. All of you. We’ll make it through this, and\nwe’ll do it together.”\nThere were several nods; Skar seemed placated. Rock finished his\nwork cutting the arrow, then proceeded to tie the pouch tightly around the\nshaft.\nSyl still sat on Kaladin’s shoulder. “You want me to watch the others?\nMake sure nobody does what Skar thinks they might?”\nKaladin hesitated, then nodded. Best to be safe. He just didn’t want the\nmen to have to think that way.\nRock hefted the arrow, judging the weight. “Near impossible shot,” he\ncomplained. Then, in a smooth motion, he nocked the arrow and drew to his\ncheek, positioning himself directly beneath the bridge. The small pouch\nhung down, dangling against the wood of the arrow. The bridgemen held\ntheir breath.\nRock loosed. The arrow streaked up the side of the chasm wall, almost\ntoo fast to follow. A faint click sounded as arrow met wood, and Kaladin\nheld his breath, but the arrow did not pull free. It remained hanging there,\nprecious spheres tied to its shaft, right next to the side of the bridge where it\ncould be reached."

You must know this\nthing.”\n“I promise,” Kaladin said. “I’ll take you if you agree, but I won’t force\nyou.”\n“I will not fight,” Rock said. “Is not my place.” He glanced up at the\nspheres, then smiled faintly. “But shooting bridge is all right.”\n“How did you learn?” Kaladin asked.\n“Is secret,” Rock said firmly. “Take bow. Bother me no more.”\n“All right,” Kaladin said, accepting the bow. “But I don’t know if I can\npromise not to bother you. I may need a few more shots in the future.” He\neyed Lopen. “You really think you can buy some rope without drawing\nattention?”\nLopen lounged back against the wall. “My cousin’s never failed me.”\n“How many cousins do you have, anyway?” Earless Jaks asked.\n“A man can never have enough cousins,” Lopen said.\n“Well, we need that rope,” Kaladin said, the plan beginning to sprout\nin his mind. “Do it, Lopen. I’ll make change from those spheres above to\npay for it.”\n“Light grows so distant. The storm never stops. I am broken, and all\naround me have died. I weep for the end of all things. He has won. Oh,\nhe has beaten us.”\n—Dated Palahakev, 1173, 16 seconds pre-death. Subject: a Thaylen\nsailor.\nDalinar fought, the Thrill pulsing within him, swinging his Shardblade from\natop Gallant’s back. Around him, Parshendi fell with eyes burning black.\nThey came at him in pairs, each team trying to hit him from a different\ndirection, keeping him busy and—they hoped—disoriented. If a pair could\nrush at him while he was distracted, they might be able to shove him off his\nmount. Those axes and maces—swung repeatedly—could crack his Plate. It\nwas a very costly tactic; corpses lay scattered around Dalinar. But when\nfighting against a Shardbearer, every tactic was costly.\nDalinar kept Gallant moving, dancing from side to side, swinging his\nBlade in broad sweeps. He stayed just a little ahead of the line of his men. A\nShardbearer needed space to fight; the Blades were so long that hurting\none’s companions was a very real danger. His honor guard would approach\nonly if he fell or encountered trouble.\nThe Thrill excited him, strengthened him. He hadn’t experienced the\nweakness again, the nausea he had on the battlefield that day weeks ago.\nPerhaps he’d been worried about nothing.\nHe turned Gallant just in time to confront two pairs of Parshendi\ncoming at him from behind, singing softly. He directed Gallant with his\nknees, performing an expert sweeping side-swing, cutting through the necks\nof two Parshendi, then the arm of a third.

The third dropped his weapon from a hand that grew\nsuddenly lifeless, flopping down, its nerves all severed.\nThe fourth member of that squad scrambled away, glaring at Dalinar.\nThis was one of the Parshendi who didn’t wear a beard, and it seemed that\nthere was something odd about his face. The cheek structure was just a little\noff….\nWas that a woman? Dalinar thought with amazement. It couldn’t have\nbeen. Could it?\nBehind him, his soldiers let out cheers as a large number of Parshendi\nscattered away to regroup. Dalinar lowered his Shardblade, the metal\ngleaming, gloryspren winking into the air around him. There was another\nreason for him to stay out ahead of his men. A Shardbearer wasn’t just a\nforce of destruction; he was a force of morale and inspiration. The men\nfought more vigorously as they saw their brightlord felling foe after foe.\nShardbearers changed battles.\nSince the Parshendi were broken for the moment, Dalinar climbed free\nof Gallant and dropped to the rocks. Corpses lay unbloodied all around him,\nthough once he approached the place where his men had been fighting,\norange-red blood stained the rocks. Cremlings scuttled about on the ground,\nlapping up the liquid, and painspren wriggled between them. Wounded\nParshendi lay staring up into the air, faces masks of pain, singing a quiet,\nhaunting song to themselves. Often just as whispers. They never yelled as\nthey died.\nDalinar felt the Thrill retreat as he joined his honor guard. “They’re\ngetting too close to Gallant,” Dalinar said to Teleb, handing over the reins.\nThe massive Ryshadium’s coat was flecked with frothy sweat. “I don’t want\nto risk him. Have a man run him to the back lines.”\nTeleb nodded, waving a soldier to obey the order. Dalinar hefted his\nShardblade, scanning the battlefield. The Parshendi force was regrouping.\nAs always, the two-person teams were the focus of their strategy. Each pair\nwould have different weapons, and often one was clean-shaven while the\nother had a beard woven with gemstones. His scholars had suggested this\nwas some kind of primitive apprenticeship.\nDalinar inspected the clean-shaven ones for signs of any stubble. There\nwas none, and more than a few had a faintly feminine shape to their faces.\nCould the ones without beards all be women? They didn’t appear to have\nmuch in the way of breasts, and their builds were like those of men, but the\nstrange Parshendi armor could be masking things. The beardless ones did\nseem smaller by a few fingers, and the shapes of the faces…studying them,\nit seemed possible. Could the pairs be husbands and wives fighting\ntogether? That struck him as strangely fascinating. Was it possible that,\ndespite six years of war, nobody had taken the time to investigate the\ngenders of those they fought?\nYes.

        "text": "genders of those they fought?\nYes. The contested plateaus were so far out, nobody ever brought back\nParshendi bodies; they just set men to pulling the gemstones out of their\nbeards or gathering their weapons. Since Gavilar’s death, very little effort\nhad been given to studying the Parshendi. Everyone just wanted them dead,\nand if there was one thing the Alethi were good at, it was killing.\nAnd you’re supposed to be killing them now, Dalinar told himself, not\nanalyzing their culture. But he did decide to have his soldiers collect a few\nbodies for the scholars.\nHe charged toward another section of the battlefield, Shardblade before\nhim in two hands, making certain not to outpace his soldiers. To the south,\nhe could see Adolin’s banner flying as he led his division against the\nParshendi there. The lad had been uncharacteristically reserved lately.\nBeing wrong about Sadeas seemed to have made him more contemplative.\nOn the west side, Sadeas’s own banner flew proudly, Sadeas’s forces\nkeeping the Parshendi from the chrysalis. He’d arrived first, as before,\nengaging the Parshendi so Dalinar’s companies could arrive. Dalinar had\nconsidered cutting out the gemheart so the Alethi could retreat, but why end\nthe battle that quickly? He and Sadeas both felt the real point of their\nalliance was to crush as many Parshendi as possible.\nThe more they killed, the faster this war would be through. And so far,\nDalinar’s plan was working. The two armies complemented one another.\nDalinar’s assaults had been too slow, and he’d allowed the Parshendi to\nposition themselves too well. Sadeas was fast—more so now that he could\nleave men behind and concentrate fully on speed—and he was frighteningly\neffective at getting men onto the plateaus to fight, but his men weren’t\ntrained as well as Dalinar’s. So if Sadeas could arrive first, then hold out\nlong enough for Dalinar to get his men across, the superior training—and\nsuperior Shards—of his forces worked like a hammer against the Parshendi,\nsmashing them against Sadeas’s anvil.\nIt was still by no means easy. The Parshendi fought like chasmfiends.\nDalinar crashed against them, swinging out with his blade, slaying\nParshendi on all sides. He couldn’t help but feel a grudging respect for the\nParshendi. Few men dared assault a Shardbearer directly—at least not\nwithout the entire weight of their army forcing them forward, almost\nagainst their will.\nThese Parshendi attacked with bravery. Dalinar spun, laying about\nhim, the Thrill surging within. With an ordinary sword, a fighter focused on\ncontrolling his blows, striking and expecting recoil. You wanted quick,\nrapid strikes with small arcs. A Shardblade was different. The Blade was\nenormous, yet remarkably light. There was never recoil; landing a blow felt\nnearly like passing the blade through the air itself. The trick was to control\nmomentum and keep the blade moving.\nFour Parshendi threw themselves at him; they seemed to know that\nworking into close quarters was one of the best ways to drop him. If they\ngot too close, the length of his Blade’s hilt and the nature of his armor"

If they\ngot too close, the length of his Blade’s hilt and the nature of his armor\nwould make fighting more difficult for him. Dalinar spun in a long, waist-\nhigh attack, and noted the deaths of Parshendi by the slight tug on the Blade\nas it passed through their chests. He got all four of them, and felt a surge of\nsatisfaction.\nIt was followed immediately by nausea.\nDamnation! he thought. Not again! He turned toward another group of\nParshendi as the eyes of the dead burned out and smoked.\nHe threw himself into another attack—raising Blade in a twisting\nswing over his head, then bringing it down parallel to the ground. Six\nParshendi died. He felt a spike of regret along with displeasure at the Thrill.\nSurely these Parshendi—these soldiers—deserved respect, not glee, as they\nwere slaughtered.\nHe remembered the times when the Thrill had been the strongest.\nSubduing the highprinces with Gavilar during their youths, forcing back the\nVedens, fighting the Herdazians and destroying the Akak Reshi. Once, the\nthirst for battle had nearly led him to attack Gavilar himself. Dalinar could\nremember the jealousy on that day some ten years ago, when the itch to\nattack Gavilar—the only worthy opponent he could see, the man who had\nwon Navani’s hand—had nearly consumed him.\nHis honor guard cheered as his foes dropped. He felt hollow, but he\nseized the Thrill and got a tight grip on his feelings and emotions. He let the\nThrill pulse through him. Blessedly, the sickness went away, which was\ngood, for another group of Parshendi charged him from the side. He\nexecuted a Windstance turn, shifting his feet, lowering his shoulder, and\nthrowing his weight behind his Blade as he swung.\nHe got three in the sweep, but the fourth and final Parshendi shoved\npast his wounded comrades, getting inside Dalinar’s reach, swinging his\nhammer. His eyes were wide with anger and determination, though he did\nnot yell or bellow. He just continued his song.\nHis blow cracked into Dalinar’s helm. It pushed his head to the side\nbut the Plate absorbed most of the hit, a few tiny weblike lines cracking\nalong its length. Dalinar could see them glowing faintly, releasing\nStormlight at the edges of his vision.\nThe Parshendi was in too close. Dalinar dropped his Blade. The\nweapon puffed away to mist as Dalinar raised an armored arm and blocked\nthe next hammer blow. Then he swung with his other arm, smashing his fist\ninto the Parshendi’s shoulder. The blow tossed the man to the ground. The\nParshendi’s song cut off. Gritting his teeth, Dalinar stepped up and kicked\nthe man in the chest, throwing the body a good twenty feet through the air.\nHe’d learned to be wary of Parshendi who weren’t fully incapacitated.\nDalinar lowered his hands and began to resummon his Shardblade. He\nfelt strong again, passion for battle returning to him. I shouldn’t feel bad for\nkilling the Parshendi, he thought. This is right.\nHe paused, noticing something.

It looked like…\nLike a second Parshendi army.\nSeveral groups of his scouts were dashing toward the main battle lines,\nbut Dalinar could guess the news they brought. “Stormfather!” he cursed,\npointing with his Shardblade. “Pass the warning! A second army\napproaches!”\nSeveral men scattered in accordance to his command. We should have\nexpected this, Dalinar thought. We started bringing two armies to a plateau,\nso they have done the same.\nBut that implied that they had limited themselves before. Did they do it\nbecause they realized that the battlefields left little room for maneuvering?\nOr was it for speed? But that didn’t make sense—the Alethi had to worry\nabout bridges as choke points, slowing them more and more if they brought\nmore troops. But the Parshendi could jump the chasms. So why commit\nfewer troops than their all?\nCurse it all, he thought with frustration. We know so little about them!\nHe shoved his Shardblade into the rock beside him, placing it\nintentionally so that it didn’t vanish. He began calling out orders. His honor\nguard formed around him, ushering in scouts and sending out runners. For a\nshort time, he became a tactical general rather than an advance warrior.\nIt took time to change their battlefield strategy. An army was like a\nmassive chull at times, lumbering along, slow to react. Before his orders\ncould be executed, the new Parshendi force began crossing over onto the\nnorth side. That was where Sadeas was fighting. Dalinar couldn’t get a good\nview, and scout reports were taking too long.\nHe glanced to the side; there was a tall rock formation nearby. It had\nuneven sides, making it look a little like a pile of boards stacked one atop\nanother. He grabbed his Shardblade in the middle of a report and ran across\nthe stony ground, smashing a few Rockbuds beneath his plated boots. The\nCobalt Guard and the messengers followed quickly.\nAt the rock formation, Dalinar tossed his Blade aside, letting it\ndissolve to smoke. He threw himself up and grabbed the rock, scaling the\nformation. Seconds later, he heaved himself up onto its flat top.\nThe battlefield stretched out below him. The main Parshendi army was\na mass of red and black at the center of the plateau, now pressed on two\nsides by the Alethi. Sadeas’ bridge crews waited on a western plateau,\nignored, while the new force of Parshendi crossed from the north onto the\nbattlefield.\nStormfather, but they can jump, Dalinar thought, watching the\nParshendi span the gap in powerful leaps. Six years of fighting had shown\nDalinar that human soldiers—particularly if lightly armored—could outrun\nParshendi troops if they had to go more than a few dozen yards. But those\nthick, powerful Parshendi legs could send them far when they leaped.\nNot a single Parshendi lost his footing as they crossed the chasm. They\napproached the chasm at a trot, then dashed with a burst of speed for about\nten feet, launching themselves forward. The new force pushed south,"

Raising a hand against the bright white\nsunlight, Dalinar found he could make out Sadeas’s personal banner.\nIt was directly in the path of the oncoming Parshendi force; he tended\nto remain at the back of his armies, in a secure position. Now, that position\nsuddenly became the front lines, and Sadeas’s other troops were too slow to\ndisengage and react. He didn’t have any support.\nSadeas! Dalinar thought, stepping right up to the lip of the stone, his\ncape streaming behind him in the breeze. I need to send him my reserve\nspearmen—\nBut no, they’d be too slow.\nThe spearmen couldn’t get to him. But someone mounted might be\nable to.\n“Gallant!” Dalinar bellowed, throwing himself off the rock formation.\nHe fell to the rocks below, Plate absorbing the shock as he hit, cracking the\nstone. Stormlight puffed up around him, rising from his armor, and the\ngreaves cracked slightly.\nGallant pulled away from his minders, galloping across the stones at\nDalinar’s call. As the horse approached, Dalinar grabbed the saddle-holds\nand heaved himself up and into place. “Follow if you can,” he bellowed at\nhis honor guard, “and send a runner to tell my son he now commands our\narmy!”\nDalinar reared Gallant and galloped alongside the perimeter of the\nbattlefield. His guard called for their horses, but they’d have difficulty\nkeeping up with a Ryshadium.\nSo be it.\nFighting soldiers became a blur to Dalinar’s right. He leaned low in the\nsaddle, wind hissing as it blew over his Shardplate. He held a hand out and\nsummoned Oathbringer. It dropped into his hand, steaming and frosted, as\nhe turned Gallant around the western tip of the battlefield. By design, the\noriginal Parshendi army lay between his force and Sadeas’s. He didn’t have\ntime to round them. So, taking a deep breath, Dalinar struck out through the\nmiddle of it. Their ranks were spread out because of how they fought.\nGallant galloped through them, and Parshendi threw themselves out of\nthe massive stallion’s way, cursing in their melodic language. Hooves beat a\nthunder upon the rocks; Dalinar urged Gallant on with his knees. They had\nto keep momentum. Some Parshendi fighting on the front against Sadeas’s\nforce turned and ran at him. They saw the opportunity. If Dalinar fell, he’d\nland alone, surrounded by thousands of enemies.\nDalinar’s heart thumped as he held his Blade out, trying to swipe at\nParshendi who came too close. Within minutes, he approached the\nnorthwestern Parshendi line. There, his enemies formed up, raising spears\nand setting them against the ground.\nBlast! Dalinar thought. Parshendi had never set spears like that against\nheavy cavalry before. They were starting to learn.\nDalinar charged the formation, then wheeled Gallant at the last"

He swung his\nShardblade out to the side, shearing the tips from their weapons and hitting\na few arms. A patch of Parshendi just ahead wavered, and Dalinar took a\ndeep breath, urging Gallant directly into them, shearing off a few spear tips.\nAnother one bounced off his shoulder armor, and Gallant took a long gash\non the left flank.\nTheir momentum carried them forward, trampling over the Parshendi,\nand with a whinny, Gallant burst free of the Parshendi line just to the side of\nwhere Sadeas’s main force was engaging the enemy.\nDalinar’s heart pumped. He passed Sadeas’s force in a blur, galloping\ntoward the back lines, where a churning, disorganized chaos of men tried to\nreact to the new Parshendi force. Men screamed and died, a mess of forest\ngreen Alethi and Parshendi in black and red.\nThere! Dalinar saw Sadeas’s banner flap for a moment before falling.\nHe threw himself from Gallant’s saddle and hit the stones. The horse turned\naway, understanding.

At times the Parshendi seemed\nalien, but their emotions were so human. The Thrill rose and Dalinar did not\nforce it down. He needed it too much. An ally was in danger.\nIt was time to let the Blackthorn loose.\nDalinar punched through the Parshendi ranks. He felled Parshendi like\na man sweeping crumbs from the table after a meal. There was no\ncontrolled precision here, no careful engagement of a few squads with his\nhonor guard at the back. This was a full-out attack, with all the power and\ndeadly force of a life-long killer enhanced by Shards. He was like a\ntempest, slashing through legs, torsos, arms, necks, killing, killing, killing.\nHe was a maelstrom of death and steel. Weapons bounced off his armor,\nleaving tiny cracks. He killed dozens, always moving, forcing his way\ntoward where Sadeas’s banner had fallen.\nEyes burned, swords flashed in the sky, and Parshendi sang. The close\npress of their own troops—bunching up as they hit Sadeas’s line—inhibited\nthem. But not Dalinar. He didn’t have to worry about striking friends, nor\ndid he have to worry about his weapon getting caught in flesh or stuck in\narmor. And if corpses got in his way, he sheared through them—dead flesh\nwould cut like steel and wood.\nSoon, Parshendi blood splashed in the air as he killed, then hacked,\nthen shoved his way through the press. Blade from shoulder to side, back\nand forth, occasionally turning to sweep at those trying to kill him from\nbehind.\nHe stumbled on a swath of green cloth. Sadeas’s banner. Dalinar spun,"

Behind him, he’d left a line of corpses that was quickly yet\ncarefully being stepped past by more Parshendi focused on him. Except just\nto his left. None of the Parshendi there turned toward him.\nSadeas! Dalinar thought, leaping forward, cutting down Parshendi\nfrom behind. That revealed a group of them bunched in a circle, beating on\nsomething below them. Something leaking Stormlight.\nJust to the side lay a large Shardbearer’s hammer, fallen where Sadeas\nhad apparently dropped it. Dalinar leaped forward, dropping his Blade and\ngrabbing the hammer. He roared as he slammed it into the group, tossing a\ndozen Parshendi away from him, then turned and swung again on the other\nside. Bodies sprayed into the air, hurled backward.\nThe hammer worked better in such close quarters; the Blade would\nsimply have killed the men, dropping their corpses to the ground, leaving\nhim still pressed and pinned. The hammer, however, flung the bodies away.\nHe leaped into the middle of the area he’d just cleared, positioning himself\nwith one foot on either side of the fallen Sadeas. He began the process of\nsummoning his Blade again and laid about him with the hammer, scattering\nhis enemies.\nAt the ninth beat of his heart, he threw the hammer into the face of a\nParshendi, then let Oathbringer reform in his hands. He fell immediately\ninto Windstance, glancing downward. Sadeas’s armor leaked Stormlight\nfrom a dozen different breaks and rifts. The breastplate had been shattered\ncompletely; broken, jagged bits of metal jutted out, revealing the uniform\nunderneath. Wisps of radiant smoke trailed from the holes.\nThere was no time to check if he still lived. The Parshendi now saw\nnot one, but two Shardbearers within their grasp, and they threw themselves\nat Dalinar. Warrior after warrior fell as Dalinar slaughtered them in sweeps,\nprotecting the space just around him.\nHe couldn’t stop them all. His armor took hits, mostly on the arms and\nback. The armor cracked, like a crystal under too much stress.\nHe roared, striking down four Parshendi as two more hit him from\nbehind, making his armor vibrate. He spun and killed one, the other barely\ndancing out of range. Dalinar began to pant, and when he moved quickly,\nhe left trails of blue Stormlight in the air. He felt like a bloodied prey beast\ntrying to fend off a thousand different snapping predators at once.\nBut he was no chull, whose only protection was to hide. He killed, and\nthe Thrill rose to a crescendo within him. He sensed real danger, a chance\nof falling, and that made the Thrill surge. He nearly choked on it, the joy,\nthe pleasure, the desire. The danger. More and more blows got through;\nmore and more Parshendi were able to duck or dodge out of the way of his\nBlade.\nHe felt a breeze through the back of his breastplate. Cooling, terrible,\nfrightening. The cracks were widening. If the breastplate burst…"

        "text": "Blade.\nHe felt a breeze through the back of his breastplate. Cooling, terrible,\nfrightening. The cracks were widening. If the breastplate burst…\nHe screamed, slamming his blade down through a Parshendi, burning\nout his eyes, dropping the man without a mark on his skin. Dalinar brought\nhis Blade up, spinning, cutting through the legs of another foe. His insides\nwere a tempest of emotions, and his brow beneath the helm streamed with\nsweat. What would happen to the Alethi army if both he and Sadeas fell\nhere? Two highprinces dead in the same battle, two sets of Plate and one\nBlade lost?\nIt couldn’t happen. He wouldn’t fall here. He didn’t yet know if he was\nmad or not. He couldn’t die until he knew!\nSuddenly, a wave of Parshendi died that he hadn’t attacked. A figure in\nbrilliant blue Shardplate burst through them. Adolin held his massive\nShardblade in a single hand, the metal gleaming.\nAdolin swung again, and the Cobalt Guard rushed forward, pouring\ninto the gap Adolin created. The Parshendi song changed tempo, becoming\nfrantic, and they fell back as more and more troops punched through, some\nin green, others in blue.\nDalinar knelt down, exhausted, letting his Blade vanish. His guard\nsurrounded him, and Adolin’s army washed over them all, overrunning the\nParshendi, forcing them back. In a few minutes, the area was secure.\nThe danger was past.\n“Father,” Adolin said, kneeling beside him, pulling his helm off. The\nyouth’s blond and black hair was disheveled and sweat-slick. “Storms! You\ngave me a fright! Are you well?”\nDalinar pulled his own helm free, sweet cooling air washing across his\ndamp face. He took a deep breath, then nodded. “Your timing is…quite\ngood, son.”\nAdolin helped Dalinar back to his feet. “I had to punch through the\nentire Parshendi army. No disrespect, Father, but what in the storms made\nyou pull a stunt like that?”\n“The knowledge that you could handle the army if I fell,” Dalinar said,\nclapping his son on the arm, their Plate clinking.\nAdolin caught sight of the back of Dalinar’s Shardplate, and his eyes\nopened wide.\n“Bad?” Dalinar asked.\n“Looks like it’s held together with spit and twine,” Adolin said.\n“You’re leaking Light like a wineskin used for archery practice.”\nDalinar nodded, sighing. Already his Plate was feeling sluggish. He’d\nprobably have to remove it before they returned to the camp, lest it freeze\non him.\nTo the side, several soldiers were pulling Sadeas free of his Plate. It\nwas so far gone that the Light had stopped save for a few tiny wisps. It\ncould be fixed, but it would be expensive—regenerating Shardplate\ngenerally shattered the gemstones it drew Light from.\nThe soldiers pulled Sadeas’s helm off, and Dalinar was relieved to see\nhis former friend blinking, looking disoriented but largely uninjured. He\nhad a cut on his thigh where one of the Parshendi had gotten him with a\nsword, and a few scrapes on his chest."

He\nhad a cut on his thigh where one of the Parshendi had gotten him with a\nsword, and a few scrapes on his chest.\nSadeas looked up at Dalinar and Adolin. Dalinar stiffened, expecting\nrecrimination—this had only happened because Dalinar had insisted on\nfighting with two armies on the same plateau. That had goaded the\nParshendi into bringing another army. Dalinar should have set proper scouts\nto watch for that.\nSadeas, however, smiled a wide grin. “Stormfather, but that was close!\nHow goes the battle?”\n“The Parshendi are routed,” Adolin said. “The last force resisting was\nthe one around you. Our men are cutting the gemheart free at this moment.\nThe day is ours.”\n“We win again!” Sadeas said triumphantly. “Dalinar, once in a while, it\nappears that senile old brain of yours can come up with a good idea or\ntwo!”\n“We’re the same age, Sadeas.” Dalinar noted as messengers\napproached, bearing reports from the rest of the battlefield.\n“Spread the word,” Sadeas proclaimed. “Tonight, all my soldiers will\nfeast as if they were lighteyes!” He smiled as his soldiers helped him to his\nfeet, and Adolin moved over to take the scout reports. Sadeas waved away\nthe help insisting he could stand despite his wound, and began calling for\nhis officers.\nDalinar turned to seek out Gallant and make sure the horse’s wound\nwas cared for. As he did, however, Sadeas caught his arm.\n“I should be dead,” Sadeas said softly.\n“Perhaps.”\n“I didn’t see much. But I thought I saw you alone. Where was your\nhonor guard?”\n“I had to leave it behind,” Dalinar said. “It was the only way to get to\nyou in time.”\nSadeas frowned. “That was a terrible risk, Dalinar. Why?”\n“You do not abandon your allies on the battlefield. Not unless there’s\nno recourse. It is one of the Codes.”\nSadeas shook his head. “That honor of yours is going to get you killed,\nDalinar.” He seemed bemused. “Not that I feel like offering a complaint\nabout it this day!”\n“If I should die,” Dalinar said, “then I would do so having lived my\nlife right. It is not the destination that matters, but how one arrives there.”\n“The Codes?”\n“No. The Way of Kings.”\n“That storming book.”\n“That storming book saved your life today, Sadeas,” Dalinar said. “I\nthink I’m starting to understand what Gavilar saw in it.”\nSadeas scowled at that, though he glanced at his armor, lying in pieces\nnearby. He shook his head. “Perhaps I shall let you tell me what you mean.\nI’d like to understand you again, old friend. I’m beginning to wonder if I\never really did.” He let go of Dalinar’s arm. “Someone bring me my\nstorming horse!

As he joined them, he was struck by the sheer number of corpses\non the ground. They ran in a line where he had punched through the\nParshendi ranks to get to Sadeas, a trail of death.\nHe looked back to where he’d made his stand. Dozens dead. Perhaps\nhundreds.\nBlood of my fathers, Dalinar thought. Did I do that? He hadn’t killed\nin such numbers since the early days of helping Gavilar unite Alethkar. And\nhe hadn’t grown sick at the sight of death since his youth.\nYet now he found himself revolted, barely able to keep his stomach\nunder control. He would not retch on the battlefield. His men should not see\nthat.\nHe stumbled away, one hand to his head, the other carrying his helm.\nHe should be exulting. But he couldn’t. He just…couldn’t.\nYou will need luck trying to understand me, Sadeas, he thought.\nBecause I’m having Damnation’s own trouble trying to do so myself.\n“I hold the suckling child in my hands, a knife at his throat, and know\nthat all who live wish me to let the blade slip. Spill its blood upon the\nground, over my hands, and with it gain us further breath to draw.”\n—Dated Shashanan, 1173, 23 seconds pre-death. Subject: a darkeyed\nyouth of sixteen years. Sample is of particular note.\n“And all the world was shattered!” Maps yelled, back arching, eyes wide,\nflecks of red spittle on his cheeks. “The rocks trembled with their steps, and\nthe stones reached toward the heavens. We die! We die!”\nHe spasmed one last time, and the light faded from his eyes. Kaladin\nsat back, crimson blood slick on his hands, the dagger he’d been using as a\nsurgical knife slipping from his fingers and clicking softly against the stone.\nThe affable man lay dead on the stones of a plateau, arrow wound in his left\nbreast open to the air, splitting the birthmark he’d claimed looked like\nAlethkar.\nIt’s taking them, Kaladin thought. One by one. Open them up, bleed\nthem out. We’re nothing more than pouches to carry blood. Then we die,\nrain it down on the stones like a highstorm’s floods.\nUntil only I remain. I always remain.\nA layer of skin, a layer of fat, a layer of muscle, a layer of bone. That\nwas what men were.\nThe battle raged across the chasm. It might as well have been another\nkingdom, for all the attention anyone gave the bridgemen. Die die die, then\nget out of our way.\nThe members of Bridge Four stood in a solemn ring around Kaladin.\n“What was that he said at the end?” Skar asked. “The rocks trembled?”\n“It was nothing,” said thick-armed Yake. “Just dying delirium. It\nhappens to men, sometimes.”\n“More often lately, it seems,” Teft said. He held his hand to his arm,\nwhere he’d hastily wrapped a bandage around an arrow wound. He\nwouldn’t be carrying a bridge anytime soon. Maps’s death and Arik’s death"

It was barely enough to carry\na bridge. The greater heaviness was very noticeable, and they had difficulty\nkeeping up with the other bridge crews. A few more losses, and they’d be in\nserious trouble.\nI should have been faster, Kaladin thought, looking down at Maps\nsplayed open, his insides exposed for the sun to dry. The arrowhead had\npierced his lung and lodged in his spine. Could Lirin have saved him? If\nKaladin had studied in Kharbranth as his father had wished, would he have\nlearned enough—known enough—to prevent deaths like this?\nThis happens sometimes, son….\nKaladin raised shaking bloody hands to his face, gripping his head, as\nmemory consumed him. A young girl, a cracked head, a broken leg, an\nangry father.\nDespair, hate, loss, frustration, horror. How could any man live this\nway? To be a surgeon, to live knowing that you would be too weak to save\nsome? When other men failed, a field of crops got worms in them. When a\nsurgeon failed, someone died.\nYou have to learn when to care….\nAs if he could choose. Banish it, like snuffing a lantern. Kaladin\nbowed beneath the weight. I should have saved him, I should have saved\nhim, I should have saved him.\nMaps, Dunny, Amark, Goshel, Dallet, Nalma. Tien.\n“Kaladin.” Syl’s voice. “Be strong.”\n“If I were strong,” he hissed, “they would live.”\n“The other bridgemen still need you. You promised them, Kaladin.\nYou gave your oath.”\nKaladin looked up. The bridgemen seemed anxious and worried. There\nwere only eight of them; Kaladin had sent the others to look for fallen\nbridgemen from other crews. They’d found three initially, minor wounds\nthat Skar could care for. No runners had come for him. Either the bridge\ncrews had no other wounded, or those wounded were beyond help.\nMaybe he should have gone to look, just in case. But—numb—he\ncould not face yet another dying man he could not save. He stumbled to his\nfeet and walked away from the corpse. He stepped up to the chasm and\nforced himself to fall into the old stance Tukks had taught him.\nFeet apart, hands behind his back, clasping forearms. Straight-backed,\nstaring forward. The familiarity brought him strength.\nYou were wrong, Father, he thought. You said I’d learn to deal with the\ndeaths. And yet here I am. Years later. Same problem.\nThe bridgemen fell in around him. Lopen approached with a\nwaterskin. Kaladin hesitated, then accepted the skin, washing off his face\nand hands. The warm water splashed across his skin, then brought welcome\ncoolness as it evaporated. He let out a deep breath, nodding thanks to the\nshort Herdazian man.\nLopen raised an eyebrow, then gestured to the pouch tied to his waist.\nHe had recovered the newest pouch of spheres they’d stuck to the bridge"

This was the fourth time they’d done that, and had recovered\nthem each without incident.\n“Did you have any trouble?” Kaladin asked.\n“No, gancho,” Lopen said, smiling widely. “Easy as tripping a\nHorneater.”\n“I heard that,” Rock said gruffly, standing in parade rest a short\ndistance away.\n“And the rope?” Kaladin asked.\n“I dropped the whole coil right over the side,” Lopen said. “But I\ndidn’t tie the end to anything. Just like you said.”\n“Good,” Kaladin said. A rope dangling from a bridge would have just\nbeen too obvious. If Hashal or Gaz caught scent of what Kaladin was\nplanning…\nAnd where is Gaz? Kaladin thought. Why didn’t he come on the bridge\nrun?\nLopen gave Kaladin the pouch of spheres, as if eager to be rid of the\nresponsibility. Kaladin accepted it, stuffing it into his trouser pocket.\nLopen retreated, and Kaladin fell back into parade rest. The plateau on\nthe other side of the chasm was long and thin, with steep slopes on the\nsides. Just as in the last few battles, Dalinar Kholin helped Sadeas’s force.\nHe always arrived late. Perhaps he blamed his slow, chull-pulled bridges.\nVery convenient. His men often had the luxury of crossing without archery\nfire.\nSadeas and Dalinar won more battles this way. Not that it mattered to\nthe bridgemen.\nMany people were dying on the other side of the chasm, but Kaladin\ndidn’t feel a thing for them. No itch to heal them, no desire to help. Kaladin\ncould thank Hav for that, for training him to think in terms of “us” and\n“them.” In a way, Kaladin had learned what his father had talked about. In\nthe wrong way, but it was something. Protect the “us,” destroy the “them.”\nA soldier had to think like that. So Kaladin hated the Parshendi. They were\nthe enemy. If he hadn’t learned to divide his mind like that, war would have\ndestroyed him.\nPerhaps it had done so anyway.\nAs he watched the battle, he focused on one thing in particular to\ndistract himself. How did the Parshendi treat their dead? Their actions\nseemed irregular. The Parshendi soldiers rarely disturbed their dead after\nthey fell; they’d take roundabout paths of attack to avoid dead bodies. And\nwhen the Alethi marched over the Parshendi dead, they formed points of\nterrible conflict.\nDid the Alethi notice? Probably not. But he could see that the\nParshendi revered their dead—revered them to the extent that they would\nendanger the living to preserve the corpses of the fallen. Kaladin could use\nthat. He would use that. Somehow.\nThe Alethi eventually won the battle. Before long, Kaladin and his\nteam were slogging back across the plateau, carrying their bridge, three\nwounded lashed to the top. They had found only those three, and a part of\nKaladin felt sick inside as he realized another part of him was glad. He had"

He had\nalready rescued some fifteen men from other bridge crews, and it was\nstraining their resources—even with the money from the pouches—to feed\nthem. Their barrack was crowded with the wounded.\nBridge Four reached a chasm, and Kaladin moved to lower his burden.\nThe process was rote to him now. Lower the bridge, quickly untie the\nwounded, push the bridge across the chasm. Kaladin checked on the three\nwounded. Every man he rescued this way seemed bemused at what he’d\ndone, even though he’d been doing it for weeks now. Satisfied that they\nwere all right, he moved to stand at parade rest while the soldiers crossed.\nBridge Four fell in around him. Increasingly, they earned scowls from\nthe soldiers—both darkeyed and lighteyed—who crossed. “Why do they do\nthat?” Moash said quietly as a passing soldier tossed an overripe pile-vine\nfruit at the bridgemen. Moash wiped the stringy, red fruit from his face,\nthen sighed and fell back into his stance. Kaladin had never asked them to\njoin him, but they did it each time.\n“When I fought in Amaram’s army,” Kaladin said, “I dreamed about\njoining the troops at the Shattered Plains. Everyone knew that the soldiers\nleft in Alethkar were the dregs. We imagined the real soldiers, off fighting in\nthe glorious war to bring retribution to those who had killed our king. Those\nsoldiers would treat their fellows with fairness. Their discipline would be\nfirm. Each would be an expert with the spear, and he would not break rank\non the battlefield.”\nTo the side, Teft snorted quietly.\nKaladin turned to Moash. “Why do they treat us so, Moash? Because\nthey know they should be better than they are. Because they see discipline\nin bridgemen, and it embarrasses them. Rather than bettering themselves,\nthey take the easier road of jeering at us.”\n“Dalinar Kholin’s soldiers don’t act like that,” Skar said from just\nbehind Kaladin. “His men march in straight ranks. There is order in their\ncamp. If they’re on duty, they don’t leave their coats unbuttoned or lounge\nabout.”\nWill I never stop hearing about Dalinar storming Kholin? Kaladin\nthought.\nMen had spoken that way of Amaram. How easy it was to ignore a\nblackened heart if you dressed it in a pressed uniform and a reputation for\nhonesty.\nSeveral hours later, the sweaty and exhausted group of bridgemen\ntramped up the incline to the lumberyard. They dumped their bridge in its\nresting place. It was getting late; Kaladin would have to purchase food\nimmediately if they were going to have supplies for the evening stew. He\nwiped his hands on his towel as the members of Bridge Four lined up.\n“You’re dismissed for evening activities,” he said. “We have chasm\nduty early tomorrow. Morning bridge practice will have to be moved to late\nafternoon.”\nThe bridgemen nodded, then Moash raised a hand.

It had the look of a practiced effort. After that, they trotted away.\nKaladin raised an eyebrow, tucking his towel into his belt. Teft hung\nback, smiling.\n“What was that?” Kaladin asked.\n“The men wanted a salute,” Teft said. “We can’t use a regular military\nsalute—not with the spearmen already thinking we’re too bigheaded. So I\ntaught them my old squad salute.”\n“When?”\n“This morning. While you were getting our schedule from Hashal.”\nKaladin smiled. Odd, how he could still do that. Nearby, the other\nnineteen bridge crews on today’s run dropped off their bridges, one by one.\nHad Bridge Four once looked like them, with those ragged beards and\nhaunted expressions? None of them spoke to one another. Some few\nglanced at Kaladin as they passed, but they looked down as soon as they\nsaw he was watching. They’d stopped treating Bridge Four with the\ncontempt they’d once shown. Curiously, they now seemed to regard\nKaladin’s crew as they did everyone else in camp—as people above them.\nThey hastened to avoid his notice.\nPoor sodden fools, Kaladin thought. Could he, maybe, persuade\nHashal to let him take a few into Bridge Four? He could the use extra men,\nand seeing those slumped figures twisted his heart.\n“I know that look, lad,” Teft said. “Why is it you always have to help\neveryone?”\n“Bah,” Kaladin said. “I can’t even protect Bridge Four. Here, let me\nlook at that arm of yours.”\n“It’s not that bad.”\nKaladin grabbed his arm anyway, peeling away the blood-crusted\nbandage. The cut was long, but shallow.\n“We need antiseptic on this,” Kaladin said, noting a few red rotspren\ncrawling around on the wound. “I should probably sew it up.”\n“It’s not that bad!”\n“Still,” Kaladin said, waving for Teft to follow as he approached one\nof the rain barrels alongside the lumberyard. The wound was shallow\nenough that Teft would probably be able to show the others spear thrusts\nand blocks tomorrow during chasm duty, but that was no excuse for leaving\nit alone to fester or scar.\nAt the rain barrel, Kaladin washed out the wound, then called for\nLopen—who was standing in the shade beside the barrack—to bring his\nmedical equipment. The Herdazian man gave that salute again, though he\ndid it with one arm, and sauntered away to get the pack.\n“So, lad,” Teft said. “How do you feel? Any odd experiences lately?”\nKaladin frowned, looking up from the arm. “Storm it, Teft! That’s the\nfifth time in two days you’ve asked me that. What are you getting at?”\n“Nothing, nothing!”\n“It is something,” Kaladin said. “What is it you’re digging for, Teft?

He pulled\nthe drawstrings open. “We’ll want to—”\nA quick motion came from Teft. Like a punch being thrown.\nKaladin moved by reflex, taking in a sharp breath, moving to a\ndefensive stance, arms up, one hand a fist, the other back to block.\nSomething blossomed within Kaladin. Like a deep breath drawn in,\nlike a burning liquor injected directly into his blood. A powerful wave\npulsed through his body. Energy, strength, awareness. It was like the body’s\nnatural alert response to danger, only it was a hundredfold more intense.\nKaladin caught Teft’s fist, moving blurringly quick. Teft froze.\n“What are you doing?” Kaladin demanded.\nTeft was smiling. He stepped back, pulling his fist free. “Kelek,” he\nsaid, shaking his hand. “That’s some grip you’ve got.”\n“Why did you try to strike me?”\n“I wanted to see something,” Teft said. “You’re holding that pouch of\nspheres Lopen gave you, you see, and your own pouch with what we’ve\ngathered lately. More Stormlight than you’ve probably ever carried, at least\nrecently.”\n“What does that have to do with anything?” Kaladin demanded. What\nwas that heat inside of him, that burning in his veins?\n“Gancho,” Lopen said, his voice awed. “You’re glowing.”\nKaladin frowned. What is he—\nAnd then he noticed it. It was very faint, but it was there, wisps of\nluminescent smoke curling up from his skin. Like steam coming off a bowl\nof hot water on a cold winter night.\nShaking, Kaladin put the medical pack on the broad rim of the water\nbarrel. He felt a moment of coldness on his skin. What was that? Shocked,\nhe raised his other hand, looking at the wisps streaming off of it.\n“What did you do to me?” he demanded, looking up at Teft.\nThe older bridgeman was still smiling.\n“Answer me!” Kaladin said, stepping forward, grabbing the front of\nTeft’s shirt. Stormfather, but I feel strong!\n“I didn’t do anything, lad,” Teft said. “You’ve been doing this for a\nwhile now. I caught you feeding off Stormlight when you were sick.”\nStormlight. Kaladin hastily released Teft, fishing at the pouch of\nspheres in his pocket. He yanked it free and pulled it open.\nIt was dark inside. All five gemstones had been drained. The white\nlight streaming from Kaladin’s skin faintly illuminated the inside of the bag.\n“Now that’s something,” Lopen said from the side. Kaladin spun to\nfind the Herdazian man bending down and looking at the medical pack.\nWhy was that so important?\nThen Kaladin saw it. He thought he’d set the pack on the rim of the\nbarrel, but in his haste he’d just pressed it against the side of the barrel. The\npack now clung to the wood.

Faintly streaming light, just like Kaladin. As Kaladin watched, the\nlight faded, and the pack slumped free and fell to the ground.\nKaladin raised a hand to his forehead, looking from the surprised\nLopen to the curious Teft. Then he glanced around the lumberyard, frantic.\nNobody else was looking at them; in the sunlight, the vapors were too faint\nto see from a distance.\nStormfather…what…how…\nHe caught sight of a familiar shape above. Syl moved like a blown\nleaf, tossed this way and that, leisurely, faint.\nShe did it! Kaladin thought. What has she done to me?\nHe stumbled away from Lopen and Teft, running toward Syl. His\nfootsteps propelling him forward with too much speed. “Syl!” he bellowed,\nstopping beneath her.\nShe zipped down to hover before him, changing from a leaf to a young\nwoman standing in the air. “Yes?”\nKaladin glanced around. “Come with me,” he said, hurrying to one of\nthe alleys between barracks. He pressed himself up against a wall, standing\nin the shade, breathing in and out. Nobody could see him here.\nSyl alighted in the air before him, hands behind her back, looking\nclosely at him. “You’re glowing.”\n“What have you done to me?”\nShe cocked her head, then shrugged.\n“Syl…” he said threateningly, though he wasn’t certain what harm he\ncould do a spren.\n“I don’t know, Kaladin,” she said frankly, sitting down, her legs\nhanging over the side of the invisible platform. “I can…I can only faintly\nremember things I used to know so well. This world, interacting with men.”\n“But you did do something.”\n“We have done something. It wasn’t me. It wasn’t you. But together…”\nShe shrugged again.\n“That isn’t very helpful.”\nShe grimaced. “I know. I’m sorry.”\nKaladin raised a hand. In the shade, the light streaming off of him was\nmore obvious. If someone walked by…“How do I get rid of it?”\n“Why do you want to get rid of it?”\n“Well, because…I…Because.”\nSyl didn’t respond.\nSomething occurred to Kaladin. Something, perhaps, he should have\nasked long ago. “You’re not a windspren, are you?”\nShe hesitated, then shook her head. “No.”\n“What are you, then?”\n“I don’t know. I bind things.”\nBind things. When she played pranks, she made items stick together.\nShoes stuck to the ground and made men trip. People reached for their\njackets hanging on hooks and couldn’t pull them free. Kaladin reached\ndown, picking a stone up off the ground. It was as big as his palm,\nweathered smooth by highstorm winds and rain. He pressed it against the\nwall of the barrack and willed his Light into the stone.\nHe felt a chill. The rock began to stream with luminescent vapors.\nWhen Kaladin pulled his hand away, the stone remained where it was,"

The rock began to stream with luminescent vapors.\nWhen Kaladin pulled his hand away, the stone remained where it was,\nclinging to the side of the building.\nKaladin leaned close, squinting. He thought he could faintly make out\ntiny spren, dark blue and shaped like little splashes of ink, clustering around\nthe place where the rock met the wall.\n“Bindspren,” Syl said, walking up beside his head; she was still\nstanding in the air.\n“They’re holding the rock in place.”\n“Maybe. Or maybe they’re attracted to what you’ve done in affixing\nthe stone there.”\n“That’s not how it works. Is it?”\n“Do rotspren cause sickness,” Syl said idly, “or are they attracted to\nit?”\n“Everyone knows they cause it.”\n“And do windspren cause the wind? Rainspren cause the rain?\nFlamespren cause fires?”\nHe hesitated. No, they didn’t. Did they? “This is pointless. I need to\nfind out how to get rid of this light, not study it.”\n“And why,” Syl repeated, “must you get rid of it? Kaladin, you’ve\nheard the stories. Men who walked on walls, men who bound the storms to\nthem. Windrunners. Why would you want to be rid of something like this?”\nKaladin struggled to define it. The healing, the way he never got hit,\nrunning at the front of the bridge…Yes, he’d known something odd was\nhappening. Why did it frighten him so? Was it because he feared being set\napart, like his father always was as the surgeon in Hearthstone? Or was it\nsomething greater?\n“I’m doing what the Radiants did,” he said.\n“That’s what I just said.”\n“I’ve been wondering if I’m bad luck, or if I’ve run afoul of something\nlike the Old Magic. Maybe this explains it! The Almighty cursed the Lost\nRadiants for betraying mankind. What if I’m cursed too, because of what\nI’m doing?”\n“Kaladin,” she said, “you are not cursed.”\n“You just said you don’t know what’s happening.” He paced in the\nalleyway. To the side, the rock finally plopped free and clattered to the\nground. “Can you say, with all certainty, that what I’m doing might not have\ndrawn bad luck down upon me? Do you know enough to deny it\ncompletely, Syl?”\nShe stood in the air, her arms folded, saying nothing.\n“This…thing,” Kaladin said, gesturing toward the stone. “It isn’t\nnatural. The Radiants betrayed mankind. Their powers left them, and they\nwere cursed. Everyone knows the legends.” He looked down at his hands,\nstill glowing, though more faintly than before. “Whatever we’ve done,\nwhatever has happened to me, I’ve somehow brought upon myself their\nsame curse. That’s why everyone around me dies when I try to help them.”\n“And you think I’m a curse?” she asked him.\n“I…Well, you said you’re part of it, and…”\nShe strode forward, pointing at him, a tiny, irate woman hanging in the"

Your failures? The deaths?”\nKaladin didn’t respond. He realized almost immediately that silence\nmight be the worst response. Syl—surprisingly human in her emotions—\nspun in the air with a wounded look and zipped away, forming a ribbon of\nlight.\nI’m overreacting, he told himself. He was just so unsettled. He leaned\nback against the wall, hand to head. Before he had time to collect his\nthoughts, shadows darkened the entry to the alleyway. Teft and Lopen.\n“Rock talkers!” Lopen said. “You really shine in shade, gancho!”\nTeft gripped Lopen’s shoulder. “He’s not going to tell anyone, lad. I’ll\nmake certain of it.”\n“Yeah, gancho,” Lopen said. “I swore I’d say nothing. You can trust a\nHerdazian.”\nKaladin looked at the two, overwhelmed. He pushed past them,\nrunning out of the alley and across the lumberyard, fleeing from watching\neyes.\nBy the time night drew close, the light had long since stopped streaming\nfrom Kaladin’s body. It had faded like a fire going out, and had only taken a\nfew minutes to vanish.\nKaladin walked southward along the edge of the Shattered Plains, in\nthat transitional area between the warcamps and the Plains themselves. In\nsome areas—like at the staging area near Sadeas’s lumbercamp—there was\na soft slope leading down between the two. At other points, there was a\nshort ridge, eight or so feet tall. He passed one of these now, rocks to his\nright, open Plains to his left.\nHollows, crevasses, and nooks scored the rock. Some shadowed\nsections here still hid pools of water from the highstorms days ago.\nCreatures still scuttled around the rocks, though the cooling evening air\nwould soon drive them to hide. He passed a place pocked with small, water-\nfilled holes; cremlings—multilegged, bearing tiny claws, their elongated\nbodies plated with carapace—lapped and fed at the edges. A small tentacle\nsnapped out, yanking one down into the hole. Probably a grasper.\nGrass grew up the side of the ridge beside him, and the blades peeked\nfrom their holes. Bunches of fingermoss sprouted like flowers amid the\ngreen. The bright pink and purple fingermoss tendrils were reminiscent of\ntentacles themselves, waving at him in the wind. When he passed, the timid\ngrass pulled back, but the fingermoss was bolder. The clumps would only\npull into their shells if he tapped the rock near them.\nAbove him, on the ridge, a few scouts stood watch over the Shattered\nPlains. This area beneath the ridge belonged to no specific highprince, and\nthe scouts ignored Kaladin. He would only be stopped if he tried to leave\nthe warcamps at the southern or northern sides.\nNone of the bridgemen had come after him. He wasn’t certain what"

He wasn’t certain what\nTeft had told them. Perhaps he’d said Kaladin was distraught following\nMaps’s death.\nIt felt odd to be alone. Ever since he’d been betrayed by Amaram and\nmade a slave, he had been in the company of others. Slaves with whom\nhe’d plotted. Bridgemen with whom he’d worked. Soldiers to guard him,\nslavemasters to beat him, friends to depend on him. The last time he’d been\nalone had been that night when he’d been tied up for the highstorm to kill\nhim.\nNo, he thought. I wasn’t alone that night. Syl was there. He lowered his\nhead, passing small cracks in the ground to his left. Those lines eventually\ngrew into chasms as they moved eastward.\nWhat was happening to him? He wasn’t delusional. Teft and Lopen\nhad seen it too. Teft had actually seemed to expect it.\nKaladin should have died during that highstorm. And yet, he had been\nup and walking shortly afterward. His ribs should still be tender, but they\nhadn’t ached in weeks. His spheres, and those of the other bridgemen near\nhim, had consistently run out of Stormlight.\nHad it been the highstorm that had changed him? But no, he’d\ndiscovered drained spheres before being hung out to die. And Syl…she’d as\nmuch as admitted responsibility for some of what had happened. This had\nbeen going on a long time.\nHe stopped beside a rock outcropping, resting against it, causing grass\nto shrink away. He looked eastward, over the Shattered Plains. His home.\nHis sepulcher. This life on them was ripping him apart. The bridgemen\nlooked up to him, thought him their leader, their savior. But he had cracks\nin him, like the cracks in the stone here at the edges of the Plains.\nThose cracks were growing larger. He kept making promises to\nhimself, like a man running a long distance with no energy left. Just a little\nfarther. Run just to that next hill. Then you can give up. Tiny fractures,\nfissures in the stone.\nIt’s right that I came here, he thought. We belong together, you and I.\nI’m like you. What had made the Plains break in the first place? Some kind\nof great weight?\nA melody began playing distantly, carrying over the Plains. Kaladin\njumped at the sound. It was so unexpected, so out of place, that it was\nstartling despite its softness.\nThe sounds were coming from the Plains. Hesitant, yet unable to resist,\nhe walked forward. Eastward, onto the flat, windswept rock. The sounds\ngrew louder as he walked, but they were still haunting, elusive. A flute,\nthough one lower in pitch than most he’d heard.\nAs he grew closer, Kaladin smelled smoke. A light was burning out\nthere. A tiny campfire.\nKaladin walked out to the edge of this particular peninsula, a chasm\ngrowing from the cracks until it plunged down into darkness. At the very tip"

        "text": "there. A tiny campfire.\nKaladin walked out to the edge of this particular peninsula, a chasm\ngrowing from the cracks until it plunged down into darkness. At the very tip\nof the peninsula—surrounded on three sides by chasm—Kaladin found a\nman sitting on a boulder, wearing a lighteyes’s black uniform. A small fire\nof rockbud shell burned in front of him. The man’s hair was short and black,\nhis face angular. He wore a thin, black-sheathed sword at his waist.\nThe man’s eyes were a pale blue. Kaladin had never heard of a\nlighteyed man playing a flute. Didn’t they consider music a feminine\npursuit? Lighteyed men sang, but they didn’t play instruments unless they\nwere ardents.\nThis man was extremely talented. The odd melody he played was\nalien, almost unreal, like something from another place and time. It echoed\ndown the chasm and came back; it almost sounded like the man was playing\na duet with himself.\nKaladin stopped a short distance away, realizing that the last thing he\nwanted to do now was deal with a brightlord, particularly one who was\neccentric enough to dress in black and wander out onto the Shattered Plains\nto practice his flute. Kaladin turned to go.\nThe music cut off. Kaladin paused.\n“I always worry that I’ll forget how to play her,” a soft voice said from\nbehind. “It’s silly, I know, considering how long I’ve practiced. But these\ndays I rarely give her the attention she deserves.”\nKaladin turned toward the stranger. His flute was carved from a dark\nwood that was almost black. The instrument seemed too ordinary to belong\nto a lighteyes, yet the man held it reverently.\n“What are you doing here?” Kaladin asked.\n“Sitting. Occasionally playing.”\n“I mean, why are you here?”\n“Why am I here?” the man asked, lowering his flute, leaning back and\nrelaxing. “Why are any of us here? That’s a rather deep question for a first\nmeeting, young bridgeman. I generally prefer introductions before theology.\nLunch too, if it can be found. Perhaps a nice nap. Actually, practically\nanything should come before theology. But especially introductions.”\n“All right,” Kaladin said. “And you are…?”\n“Sitting. Occasionally playing… with the minds of bridgemen.”\nKaladin reddened, turning again to go. Let the fool lighteyes say, and\ndo, what he wished. Kaladin had difficult decisions to think about.\n“Well, off with you then,” the lighteyes said from behind. “Glad you\nare going. Wouldn’t want you too close. I’m rather attached to my\nStormlight.”\nKaladin froze. Then he spun. “What?”\n“My spheres,” the strange man said, holding up what appeared to be a\nfully infused emerald broam. “Everyone knows that bridgemen are thieves,\nor at least beggars.”\nOf course. He had been talking about spheres. He didn’t know about\nKaladin’s… affliction. Did he? The man’s eyes twinkled as if at a grand\njoke.\n“Don’t be insulted at being called a thief,” the man said, raising a\nfinger. Kaladin frowned. Where had the sphere gone? He had been holding"

He had been holding\nit in that hand. “I meant it as a compliment.”\n“A compliment? Calling someone a thief?”\n“Of course. I myself am a thief.”\n“You are? What do you steal?”\n“Pride,” the man said, leaning forward. “And occasionally boredom, if\nI may take the pride unto myself. I am the King’s Wit. Or I was until\nrecently. I think I shall probably lose the title soon.”\n“The king’s what?”\n“Wit. It was my job to be witty.”\n“Saying confusing things isn’t the same as being witty.”\n“Ah,” the man said, eyes twinkling. “Already you prove yourself more\nwise than most who have been my acquaintance lately. What is it to be\nwitty, then?”\n“To say clever things.”\n“And what is cleverness?”\n“I…” Why was he having this conversation? “I guess it’s the ability to\nsay and do the right things at the right time.”\nThe King’s Wit cocked his head, then smiled. Finally, he held out his\nhand to Kaladin. “And what is your name, my thoughtful bridgeman?”\nKaladin hesitantly raised his own hand. “Kaladin. And yours?”\n“I’ve many.” The man shook Kaladin’s hand. “I began life as a\nthought, a concept, words on a page. That was another thing I stole. Myself.\nAnother time, I was named for a rock.”\n“A pretty one, I hope.”\n“A beautiful one,” the man said. “And one that became completely\nworthless for my wearing it.”\n“Well, what do men call you now?”\n“Many a thing, and only some of them polite. Almost all are true,\nunfortunately. You, however, you may call me Hoid.”\n“Your name?”\n“No. The name of someone I should have loved. Once again, this is a\nthing I stole. It is something we thieves do.” He glanced eastward, over the\nrapidly darkening Plains. The little fire burning beside Hoid’s boulder shed\na fugitive light, red from glimmering coals.\n“Well, it was pleasant to meet you,” Kaladin said. “I will be on my\nway….”\n“Not before I give you something.” Hoid picked up his flute. “Wait,\nplease.”\nKaladin sighed. He had a feeling that this odd man was not going to let\nhim escape until he was done.\n“This is a Trailman’s flute,” Hoid said, inspecting the length of dark\nwood. “It is meant to be used by a storyteller, for him to play while he is\ntelling a story.”\n“You mean to accompany a storyteller. Being played by someone else\nwhile he speaks.”\n“Actually, I meant what I said.”\n“How would a man tell a story while playing the flute?”\nHoid raised an eyebrow, then lifted the flute to his lips. He played it\ndifferently from flutes Kaladin had seen—instead of holding it down in\nfront of him, Hoid held it out to the side and blew across its top. He tested a\nfew notes. They had the same melancholy tone that Kaladin had heard\nbefore."

They had the same melancholy tone that Kaladin had heard\nbefore.\n“This story,” Hoid said, “is about Derethil and the Wandersail.”\nHe began to play. The notes were quicker, sharper, than the ones he’d\nplayed earlier. They almost seemed to tumble over one another, scurrying\nout of the flute like children racing one another to be first. They were\nbeautiful and crisp, rising and falling scales, intricate as a woven rug.\nKaladin found himself transfixed. The tune was powerful, almost\ndemanding. As if each note were a hook, flung out to spear Kaladin’s flesh\nand hold him near.\nHoid stopped abruptly, but the notes continued to echo in the chasm,\ncoming back as he spoke. “Derethil is well known in some lands, though I\nhave heard him spoken of less here in the East. He was a king during the\nshadowdays, the time before memory. A powerful man. Commander of\nthousands, leader of tens of thousands. Tall, regal, blessed with fair skin and\nfairer eyes. He was a man to envy.”\nJust as the echoes faded below, Hoid began to play again, picking up\nthe rhythm. He actually seemed to continue just where the echoing notes\ngrew too soft, as if there had never been a break in the music. The notes\ngrew more smooth, suggesting a king walking through court with his\nattendants. As Hoid played, eyes closed, he leaned forward toward the fire.\nThe air he blew over the flute churned the smoke, stirring it.\nThe music grew softer. The smoke swirled, and Kaladin thought he\ncould make out the face of a man in the patterns of smoke, a man with a\npointed chin and lofty cheekbones. It wasn’t really there, of course. Just\nimagination. But the haunting song and the swirling smoke seemed to\nencourage his imagination.\n“Derethil fought the Voidbringers during the days of the Heralds and\nRadiants,” Hoid said, eyes still closed, flute just below his lips, the song\nechoing in the chasm and seeming to accompany his words. “When there\nwas finally peace, he found he was not content. His eyes always turned\nwestward, toward the great open sea. He commissioned the finest ship men\nhad ever known, a majestic vessel intended to do what none had dared\nbefore: sail the seas during a highstorm.”\nThe echoes tapered off, and Hoid began playing again, as if alternating\nwith an invisible partner. The smoke swirled, rising in the air, twisting in\nthe wind of Hoid’s breath. And Kaladin almost thought he could see an\nenormous ship in a shipyard, with a sail as large as a building, secured to an\narrowlike hull. The melody became quick and clipped, as if to imitate the\nsounds of mallets pounding and saws cutting.\n“Derethil’s goal,” Hoid paused and said, “was to seek the origin of the\nVoidbringers, the place where they had been spawned. Many called him a\nfool, yet he could not hold himself back. He named the vessel the\nWandersail and gathered a crew of the bravest of sailors. Then, on a day"

Then, on a day\nwhen a highstorm brewed, this ship cast off. Riding out into the ocean, the\nsail hung wide, like arms open to the stormwinds….”\nThe flute was at Hoid’s lips in a second and he stirred the fire by\nkicking at a piece of rockbud shell. Sparks of flame rose in the air and\nsmoke puffed, swirling as Hoid rotated his head down and pointed the\nflute’s holes at the smoke. The song became violent, tempestuous, notes\nfalling unexpectedly and trilling with quick undulations. Scales rippled into\nhigh notes, where they screeched airily.\nAnd Kaladin saw it in his mind’s eye. The massive ship suddenly\nminiscule before the awesome power of a highstorm. Blown, carried out\ninto the endless sea. What had this Derethil hoped or expected to find? A\nhighstorm on land was terrible enough. But on the sea?\nThe sounds bounced off the echoing walls below. Kaladin found\nhimself sinking down to the rocks, watching the swirling smoke and rising\nflames. Seeing the tiny ship captured and held within a furious maelstrom.\nEventually, Hoid’s music slowed, and the violent echoes faded, leaving\na much gentler song. Like lapping waves.\n“The Wandersail was nearly destroyed in the crash, but Derethil and\nmost of his sailors survived. They found themselves on a ring of small\nislands surrounding an enormous whirlpool, where, it is said, the ocean\ndrains. Derethil and his men were greeted by a strange people with long,\nlimber bodies who wore robes of single color and shells in their hair unlike\nany that grow back on Roshar.\n“These people took the survivors in, fed them, and nursed them back\nto health. During his weeks of recovery, Derethil studied the strange people,\nwho called themselves the Uvara, the People of the Great Abyss. They lived\ncurious lives. Unlike the people in Roshar—who constantly argue— the\nUvara always seemed to agree. From childhood, there were no questions.\nEach and every person went about his duty.”\nHoid began the music again, letting the smoke rise unhindered.\nKaladin thought he could see in it a people, industrious, always working. A\nbuilding rose among them with a figure at the window, Derethil, watching.\nThe music was calming, curious.\n“One day,” Hoid said, “while Derethil and his men were sparring to\nregain strength, a young serving girl brought them refreshment. She tripped\non an uneven stone, dropping the goblets to the floor and shattering them. In\na flash, the other Uvara descended on the hapless child and slaughtered her\nin a brutal way. Derethil and his men were so stunned that by the time they\nregained their wits, the child was dead. Angry, Derethil demanded to know\nthe cause of the unjustified murder. One of the other natives explained. ‘Our\nemperor will not suffer failure.’”\nThe music began again, sorrowful, and Kaladin shivered. He witnessed\nthe girl being bludgeoned to death with rocks, and the proud form of\nDerethil bowing above her fallen body."

He witnessed\nthe girl being bludgeoned to death with rocks, and the proud form of\nDerethil bowing above her fallen body.\nKaladin knew that sorrow. The sorrow of failure, of letting someone\ndie when he should have been able to do something. So many people he\nloved had died.\nHe had a reason for that now. He’d drawn the ire of the Heralds and\nthe Almighty. It had to be that, didn’t it?\nHe knew he should be getting back to Bridge Four. But he couldn’t\npull himself away. He hung on the storyteller’s words.\n“As Derethil began to pay more attention,” Hoid said, his music\nechoing softly to accompany him, “he saw other murders. These Uvara,\nthese People of the Great Abyss, were prone to astonishing cruelty. If one of\ntheir members did something wrong—something the slightest bit untoward\nor unfavorable—the others would slaughter him or her. Each time he asked,\nDerethil’s caretaker gave him the same answer. ‘Our emperor will not suffer\nfailure.’”\nThe echoing music faded, but once again Hoid lifted his flute just as it\ngrew too soft to hear. The melody grew solemn. Soft, quiet, like a lament\nfor one who had passed. And yet it was edged with mystery, occasional\nquick bursts, hinting at secrets.\nKaladin frowned as he watched the smoke spin, making what appeared\nto be a tower. Tall, thin, with an open structure at the top.\n“The emperor, Derethil discovered, resided in the tower on the eastern\ncoast of the largest island among the Uvara.”\nKaladin felt a chill. The smoke images were just from his mind, adding\nto the story, weren’t they? Had he really seen a tower before Hoid\nmentioned it?\n“Derethil determined that he needed to confront this cruel emperor.\nWhat kind of monster would demand that such an obviously peaceful\npeople kill so often and so terribly? Derethil gathered his sailors, a heroic\ngroup, and they armed themselves. The Uvara did not try to stop them,\nthough they watched with fright as the strangers stormed the emperor’s\ntower.”\nHoid fell silent, and didn’t turn back to his flute. Instead, he let the\nmusic echo in the chasm. It seemed to linger this time. Long, sinister notes.\n“Derethil and his men came out of the tower a short time later,\ncarrying a desiccated corpse in fine robes and jewelry. ‘This is your\nemperor?’ Derethil demanded. ‘We found him in the top room, alone.’ It\nappeared that the man had been dead for years, but nobody had dared enter\nhis tower. They were too frightened of him.\n“When he showed the Uvara the dead body, they began to wail and\nweep. The entire island was cast into chaos, as the Uvara began to burn\nhomes, riot, or fall to their knees in torment. Amazed and confused,\nDerethil and his men stormed the Uvara shipyards, where the Wandersail\nwas being repaired. Their guide and caretaker joined them, and she begged\nto accompany them in their escape. So it was that Nafti joined the crew.\n“Derethil and his men set sail, and though the winds were still, they"

They gathered on the deck,\nwatching, and Derethil asked Nafti the reason for the terrible riots.”\nHoid fell silent, letting his words rise with the strange smoke, lost to\nthe night.\n“Well?” Kaladin demanded. “What was her response?”\n“Holding a blanket around herself, staring with haunted eyes at her\nlands, she replied, ‘Do you not see, Traveling One? If the emperor is dead,\nand has been all these years, then the murders we committed are not his\nresponsibility. They are our own.’”\nKaladin sat back. Gone was the taunting, playful tone Hoid had used\nearlier. No more mockery. No more quick tongue intended to confuse. This\nstory had come from within his heart, and Kaladin found he could not\nspeak. He just sat, thinking of that island and the terrible things that had\nbeen done.\n“I think…” Kaladin finally replied, licking his dry lips, “I think that is\ncleverness.”\nHoid raised an eyebrow, looking up from his flute.\n“Being able to remember a story like that,” Kaladin said, “to tell it\nwith such care.”\n“Be wary of what you say,” Hoid said, smiling. “If all you need for\ncleverness is a good story, then I’ll find myself out of a job.”\n“Didn’t you say you were already out of a job?”\n“True. The king is finally without wit. I wonder what that makes him.”\n“Um… witless?” Kaladin said.\n“I’ll tell him you said that,” Hoid noted, eyes twinkling. “But I think\nit’s inaccurate. One can have a wit, but not a witless. What is a wit?”\n“I don’t know. Some kind of spren in your head, maybe, that makes\nyou think?”\nHoid cocked his head, then laughed. “Why, I suppose that’s as good an\nexplanation as any.” He stood up, dusting off his black trousers.\n“Is the story true?” Kaladin asked, rising too.\n“Perhaps.”\n“But how would we know it? Did Derethil and his men return?”\n“Some stories say they did.”\n“But how could they? The highstorms only blow one direction.”\n“Then I guess the story is a lie.”\n“I didn’t say that.”\n“No, I said it. Fortunately, it’s the best kind of lie.”\n“And what kind is that?”\n“Why, the kind I tell, of course.” Hoid laughed, then kicked out the\nfire, grinding the last of the coals beneath his heel. It didn’t really seem\nthere had been enough fuel to make the smoke Kaladin had seen.\n“What did you put in the fire?” Kaladin said. “To make that special\nsmoke?”\n“Nothing. It was just an ordinary fire.”\n“But, I saw—”\n“What you saw belongs to you. A story doesn’t live until it is imagined\nin someone’s mind.”"

A story doesn’t live until it is imagined\nin someone’s mind.”\n“What does the story mean, then?”\n“It means what you want it to mean,” Hoid said. “The purpose of a\nstoryteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think\nupon. Too often, we forget that.”\nKaladin frowned, looking westward, back toward the warcamps. They\nwere alight now with spheres, lanterns, and candles. “It means taking\nresponsibility,” Kaladin said. “The Uvara, they were happy to kill and\nmurder, so long as they could blame the emperor. It wasn’t until they\nrealized there was nobody to take the responsibility that they showed grief.”\n“That’s one interpretation,” Hoid said. “A fine one, actually. So what is\nit you don’t want to take responsibility for?”\nKaladin started. “What?”\n“People see in stories what they’re looking for, my young friend.” He\nreached behind his boulder, pulling out a pack and slinging it on his\nshoulder. “I have no answers for you. Most days, I feel I never have had any\nanswers. I’ve come to your land to chase an old acquaintance, but I end up\nspending most of my time hiding from him instead.”\n“You said… about me and responsibility…”\n“Just an idle comment, nothing more.” He reached over, laying a hand\non Kaladin’s shoulder. “My comments are often idle. I never can get them\nto do any solid work. Would that I could make my words carry stones. That\nwould be something to see.” He held out the dark wood flute. “Here. I’ve\ncarried her for longer than you’d believe, were I to tell you the truth. Take\nher for yourself.”\n“But I don’t know how to play it!”\n“Then learn,” Hoid said, pressing the flute into Kaladin’s hand. “When\nyou can make the music sing back at you, then you’ve mastered it.” He\nbegan to walk away. “And take good care of that blasted apprentice of\nmine. He really should have let me know he was still alive. Perhaps he\nfeared I’d come to rescue him again.”\n“Apprentice?”\n“Tell him I graduate him,” Hoid said, still walking. “He’s a full\nWorldsinger now. Don’t let him get killed. I spent far too long trying to\nforce some sense into that brain of his.”\nSigzil, Kaladin thought. “I’ll give him the flute,” he called after Hoid.\n“No you won’t,” Hoid said, turning, walking backward as he left. “It’s\na gift to you, Kaladin Stormblessed. I expect you to be able to play it when\nnext we meet!”\nAnd with that, the storyteller turned and broke into a jog, heading off\ntoward the warcamps. He didn’t move to go up into them, however. His\nshadowed figure turned to the south, as if he were intending to leave the\ncamps. Where was he going?\nKaladin looked down at the flute in his hand. It was heavier than he\nhad expected. What kind of wood was it? He rubbed its smooth length,\nthinking."

He rubbed its smooth length,\nthinking.\n“I don’t like him,” Syl’s voice said suddenly, coming from behind.\n“He’s strange.”\nKaladin spun to find her on the boulder, sitting where Hoid had been a\nmoment ago.\n“Syl!” Kaladin said. “How long have you been here?”\nShe shrugged. “You were watching the story. I didn’t want to\ninterrupt.” She sat with hands in her lap, looking uncomfortable.\n“Syl—”\n“I’m behind what is happening to you,” she said, voice soft. “I’m\ndoing it.”\nKaladin frowned, stepping forward.\n“It’s both of us,” she said. “But without me, nothing would be\nchanging in you. I’m… taking something from you. And giving something\nin return. It’s the way it used to work, though I can’t remember how or\nwhen. I just know that it was.”\n“I—”\n“Hush,” she said. “I’m talking.”\n“Sorry.”\n“I’m willing to stop it, if you want,” she said. “But I would go back to\nbeing as I was before. That scares me. Floating on the wind, never\nremembering anything for longer than a few minutes. It’s because of this tie\nbetween us that I can think again, that I can remember what and who I am.\nIf we end it, I lose that.”\nShe looked up at Kaladin, sorrowful.\nHe looked into those eyes, then took a deep breath. “Come,” he said,\nturning, walking back down the peninsula.\nShe flew over, becoming a ribbon of light, floating idly in the air\nbeside his head. Soon they reached the place beneath the ridge leading to\nthe warcamps. Kaladin turned north, toward Sadeas’s camp. The cremlings\nhad retreated to their cracks and burrows, but many of the plants still\ncontinued to let their fronds float in the cool wind. When he passed, the\ngrass pulled back in, looking like the fur of some black beast in the night, lit\nby Salas.\nWhat responsibility are you avoiding….\nHe wasn’t avoiding responsibility. He took too much responsibility!\nLirin had said it constantly, chastising Kaladin for feeling guilt over deaths\nhe couldn’t have prevented.\nThough there was one thing he clung to. An excuse, perhaps, like the\ndead emperor. It was the soul of the wretch. Apathy. The belief that nothing\nwas his fault, the belief that he couldn’t change anything. If a man was\ncursed, or if he believed he didn’t have to care, then he didn’t need to hurt\nwhen he failed. Those failures couldn’t have been prevented. Someone or\nsomething else had ordained them.\n“If I’m not cursed,” Kaladin said softly, “then why do I live when\nothers die?”\n“Because of us,” Syl said. “This bond. It makes you stronger,\nKaladin.”\n“Then why can’t it make me strong enough to help the others?”\n“I don’t know,” Syl said. “Maybe it can.”\nIf I get rid of it, I’ll go back to being normal.

For what purpose… so I\ncan die with the others?\nHe continued to walk in the darkness, passing lights above that made\nvague, faint shadows on the stones in front of him. The tendrils of\nfingermoss, clumped in bunches. Their shadows seemed arms.\nHe thought often about saving the bridgemen. And yet, as he\nconsidered, he realized that he often framed saving them in terms of saving\nhimself. He told himself he wouldn’t let them die, because he knew what\nit would do to him if they did. When he lost men, the wretch threatened to\ntake over because of how much Kaladin hated failing.\nWas that it? Was that why he searched for reasons why he might be\ncursed? To explain his failure away? Kaladin began to walk more quickly.\nHe was doing something good in helping the bridgemen—but he also\nwas doing something selfish. The powers had unsettled him because of the\nresponsibility they represented.\nHe broke into a jog. Before long, he was sprinting.\nBut if it wasn’t about him—if he wasn’t helping the bridgemen\nbecause he loathed failure, or because he feared the pain of watching them\ndie— then it would be about them. About Rock’s affable gibes, about\nMoash’s intensity, about Teft’s earnest gruff ness or Peet’s quiet\ndependability. What would he do to protect them? Give up his illusions?\nHis excuses?\nSeize whatever opportunity he could, no matter how it changed him?\nNo matter how it unnerved him, or what burdens it represented?\nHe dashed up the incline to the lumberyard.\nBridge Four was making their evening stew, chatting and laughing.\nThe nearly twenty wounded men from other crews sat eating gratefully. It\nwas gratifying, how quickly they had lost their hollow-eyed expressions and\nbegun laughing with the other men.\nThe smell of spicy Horneater stew was thick in the air. Kaladin slowed\nhis jog, coming to a stop beside the bridgemen. Several looked concerned\nas they saw him, panting and sweating. Syl landed on his shoulder.\nKaladin sought out Teft. The aging bridgeman sat alone below the\nbarrack’s eaves, staring down at the rock in front of him. He hadn’t noticed\nKaladin yet. Kaladin gestured for the others to continue, then walked over\nto Teft. He squatted down before the man.\nTeft looked up in surprise. “Kaladin?”\n“What do you know?” Kaladin said quietly, intense. “And how do you\nknow it?”\n“I—” Teft said. “When I was a youth, my family belonged to a secret\nsect that awaited the return of the Radiants. I quit when I was just a youth. I\nthought it was nonsense.”\nHe was holding things back; Kaladin could tell from the hesitation in\nhis voice.\nResponsibility. “How much do you know about what I can do?”\n“Not much,” Teft said. “Just legends and stories. Nobody really knows\nwhat the Radiants could do, lad.”\nKaladin met his eyes, then smiled. “Well, we’re going to find out.”"

She is here! She\nwatches me die!”\n—Dated Shashabev, 1173, 8 seconds pre-death. Subject: a darkeyed\ndock-worker in his forties, father of three.\n“I have a serious loathing of being wrong.” Adolin reclined in his chair, one\nhand resting leisurely on the crystal-topped table, the other swirling wine in\nhis cup. Yellow wine. He wasn’t on duty today, so he could indulge just a\ntad.\nWind ruffled his hair; he was sitting with a group of other young\nlighteyes at the outdoor tables of an Outer Market wineshop. The Outer\nMarket was a collection of buildings that had grown up near the king’s\npalace, outside the warcamps. An eclectic mix of people passed on the\nstreet below their terraced seating.\n“I should think that everyone shares your dislike, Adolin,” Jakamav\nsaid, leaning with both elbows on the table. He was a sturdy man, a\nlighteyes of the third dahn from Highprince Roion’s camp. “Who likes\nbeing wrong?”\n“I’ve known a number of people who prefer it,” Adolin said\nthoughtfully. “Of course, they don’t admit that fact. But what else could one\npresume from the frequency of their error?”\nInkima—Jakamav’s accompaniment for the afternoon—gave a tinkling\nlaugh. She was a plump thing with light yellow eyes who dyed her hair\nblack. She wore a red dress. The color did not look good on her.\nDanlan was also there, of course. She sat on a chair beside Adolin,\nkeeping proper distance, though she’d occasionally touch his arm with her\nfreehand. Her wine was violet. She did like her wine, though she seemed to\nmatch it to her outfits. A curious trait. Adolin smiled. She looked extremely\nfetching, with that long neck and graceful build wrapped in a sleek dress.\nShe didn’t dye her hair, though it was mostly auburn. There was nothing\nwrong with light hair. In fact, why was it that they all were so fond of dark\nhair, when light eyes were the ideal?\nStop it, Adolin told himself. You’ll end up brooding as much as Father.\nThe other two—Toral and his companion Eshava—were both lighteyes\nfrom Highprince Aladar’s camp. House Kholin was currently out of favor,\nbut Adolin had acquaintances or friends in nearly all of the warcamps.\n“Wrongness can be amusing,” Toral said. “It keeps life interesting. If\nwe were all right all the time, where would that leave us?”\n“My dear,” his companion said. “Didn’t you once claim to me that you\nwere nearly always right?”\n“Yes,” Toral said. “And so if everyone were like me, who would I\nmake sport of?

He had a formal duel in the\narena today, and he’d found that a cup of yellow beforehand helped him\nrelax. “Well, you needn’t worry about me being right too often, Toral. I was\nsure Sadeas would move against my father. It doesn’t make sense. Why\nwouldn’t he?”\n“Positioning, perhaps?” Toral said. He was a keen fellow, known for\nhis refined sense of taste. Adolin always wanted him along when trying\nwines. “He wants to look strong.”\n“He was strong,” Adolin said. “He gains no more by not moving\nagainst us.”\n“Now,” Danlan said, voice soft with a breathless quality to it, “I know\nthat I’m quite new to the warcamps, and my assessment is bound to reflect\nmy ignorance, but—”\n“You always say that, you know,” Adolin said idly. He liked her voice\nquite a bit.\n“I always say what?”\n“That you’re ignorant,” Adolin said. “However, you’re anything but.\nYou’re among the most clever women I’ve met.”\nShe hesitated, looking oddly annoyed for a moment. Then she smiled.\n“You shouldn’t say such things—Adolin—when a woman is attempting\nhumility.”\n“Oh, right. Humility. I’ve forgotten that existed.”\n“Too much time around Sadeas’s lighteyes?” Jakamav said, eliciting\nanother tinkling laugh from Inkima.\n“Anyway,” Adolin said. “I’m sorry. Please continue.”\n“I was saying,” Danlan said, “that I doubt Sadeas would wish to start a\nwar. Moving against your father in such an obvious way would have done\nthat, wouldn’t it?”\n“Undoubtedly,” Adolin said.\n“So perhaps that is why he held himself back.”\n“I don’t know,” Toral said. “He could have cast shame on your family\nwithout attacking you—he could have implied, for instance, that you’d been\nnegligent and foolish in not protecting the king, but that you hadn’t been\nbehind the assassination attempt.”\nAdolin nodded.\n“That still could have started a war,” Danlan said.\n“Perhaps,” Toral said. “But you have to admit, Adolin, that the\nBlackthorn’s reputation is a little less than… impressive of late.”\n“And what does that mean?” Adolin snapped.\n“Oh, Adolin,” Toral said waving a hand and raising his cup for some\nmore wine. “Don’t be tiresome. You know what I’m saying, and you also\nknow I mean no insult by it. Where is that serving woman?”\n“One would think,” Jakamav added, “that after six years out here, we\ncould get a decent winehouse.”\nInkima laughed at that too. She was really getting annoying.\n“My father’s reputation is sound,” Adolin said. “Or have you not been\npaying attention to our victories lately?”\n“Achieved with Sadeas’s help,” Jakamav said.\n“Achieved nonetheless,” Adolin said. “In the last few months, my\nfather’s saved not only Sadeas’s life, but that of the king himself. He fights"

Surely you can see that previous rumors about him were absolutely\nunfounded.”\n“All right, all right,” Toral said. “No need to get upset, Adolin. We can\nall agree that your father is a wonderful man. But you were the one who\ncomplained to us that you wanted to change him.”\nAdolin studied his wine. Both of the other men at the table wore the\nsort of outfits Adolin’s father frowned upon. Short jackets over colorful silk\nshirts. Toral wore a thin yellow silk scarf at the neck and another around his\nright wrist. It was quite fashionable, and looked far more comfortable than\nAdolin’s uniform. Dalinar would have said that the outfits looked silly, but\nsometimes fashion was silly. Bold, different. There was something\ninvigorating about dressing in a way that interested others, moving with the\nwaves of style. Once, before joining his father at the war, Adolin had loved\nbeing able to design a look to match a given day. Now he had only two\noptions: summer uniform coat or winter uniform coat.\nThe serving maid finally arrived, bringing two carafes of wine, one\nyellow and one deep blue. Inkima giggled as Jakamav leaned over and\nwhispered something in her ear.\nAdolin held up a hand to forestall the maid from filling his cup. “I’m\nnot sure I want to see my father change. Not anymore.”\nToral frowned. “Last week—”\n“I know,” Adolin said. “That was before I saw him rescue Sadeas.\nEvery time I start to forget how amazing my father is, he does something to\nprove me one of the ten fools. It happened when Elhokar was in danger too.\nIt’s like… my father only acts like that when he really cares about\nsomething.”\n“You imply that he doesn’t really care about the war, Adolin dear,”\nDanlan said.\n“No,” Adolin said. “Just that the lives of Elhokar and Sadeas might be\nmore important than killing Parshendi.”\nThe others took that for an explanation, moving on toward other\ntopics. But Adolin found himself circling the thought. He felt unsettled\nlately. Being wrong about Sadeas was one cause; the chance that they might\nactually be able to prove the visions right or wrong was another.\nAdolin felt trapped. He’d pushed his father to confront his own sanity,\nand now—by what their last conversation had established—he had all but\nagreed to accept his father’s decision to step down if the visions proved\nfalse.\nEveryone hates being wrong, Adolin thought. Except my father said\nhe’d rather be wrong, if it would be better for Alethkar. Adolin doubted\nmany lighteyes would rather be proven mad than right.\n“Perhaps,” Eshava was saying. “But that doesn’t change all of his\nfoolish restrictions. I wish he would step down.”\nAdolin started. “What? What was that?”\nEshava glanced at him. “Nothing. Just seeing if you were attending the\nconversation, Adolin.”\n“No,” Adolin said. “Tell me what you were saying.”\nShe shrugged, looking at Toral."

Word is that he\nshould abdicate because of it.”\n“That would be foolish,” Adolin said firmly. “Considering how much\nsuccess he’s showing in battle.”\n“Stepping down would be far too much of an overreaction,” Danlan\nagreed. “Though, Adolin, I do wish you could get your father to relax all of\nthese foolish restrictions our camp is under. You and the other Kholin men\nwould be able to truly join society again.”\n“I’ve tried,” he said, checking the position of the sun. “Trust me. And,\nunfortunately, I have a duel to prepare for. If you’ll excuse me.”\n“Some more of Sadeas’s sycophants?” Jakamav asked.\n“No,” Danlan said, smiling. “It’s Brightlord Resi. There’ve been some\nvocal provocations from Thanadal, and this might serve to shut his mouth.”\nShe looked at Adolin fondly. “I’ll meet you there.”\n“Thanks,” he said, rising, doing up the buttons on his coat. He kissed\nDanlan’s freehand, waved to the others, and trotted out onto the street.\nThat was something of an abrupt departure for me, he thought. Will\nthey see how uncomfortable the discussion made me? Probably not. They\ndidn’t know him as Renarin did. Adolin liked to be familiar with a large\nnumber of people, but not terribly close with any of them. He didn’t even\nknow Danlan that well yet. He would make his relationship with her last,\nthough. He was tired of Renarin teasing him for jumping in and out of\ncourtships. Danlan was very pretty; it seemed the courtship could work.\nHe passed through the Outer Market, Toral’s words weighing on him.\nAdolin didn’t want to become highprince. He wasn’t ready. He liked\ndueling and chatting with his friends. Leading the army was one thing—but\nas highprince, he’d have to think of other things. Such as the future of the\nwar on the Shattered Plains, or protecting and advising the king.\nThat shouldn’t have to be our problem, he thought. But it was as his\nfather always said. If they didn’t do it, who would?\nThe Outer Market was far more disorganized than the markets inside\nDalinar’s warcamp. Here, the ramshackle buildings—mostly built of stone\nblocks quarried from nearby—had grown up without any specific plan. A\nlarge number of the merchants were Thaylen, with their typical caps, vests,\nand long, wagging eyebrows.\nThe busy market was one of the few places where soldiers from all ten\nwarcamps mingled. In fact, that had become one of the main functions of\nthe place; it was neutral ground where men and women from different\nwarcamps could meet. It also provided a market that wasn’t heavily\nregulated, though Dalinar had stepped in to provide some rules once the\nmarketplace had begun to show signs of lawlessness."

It also provided a market that wasn’t heavily\nregulated, though Dalinar had stepped in to provide some rules once the\nmarketplace had begun to show signs of lawlessness.\nAdolin nodded to a passing group of Kholin soldiers in blue, who\nsaluted him. They were on patrol, halberds held at their shoulders, helms\ngleaming. Dalinar’s troops patrolled this place, and his scribes watched over\nit. All at his own cost.\nHis father didn’t like the layout of the Outer Market or its lack of\nwalls. He said that a raid could be catastrophic to it, that it violated the spirit\nof the Codes. But it had been years since the Parshendi had raided the\nAlethi side of the Plains. And if they did decide to strike at the warcamps,\nthe scouts and guards would give ample warning.\nSo what was the point of the Codes? Adolin’s father acted as if they\nwere vitally important. Always be in uniform, always be armed, always stay\nsober. Be ever vigilant while under threat of attack. But there was no threat\nof attack.\nAs he walked through the market, Adolin looked—really looked—for\nthe first time and tried to see what it was his father was doing.\nHe could pick out Dalinar’s officers easily. They wore their uniforms,\nas commanded. Blue coats and trousers with silver buttons, knots on the\nshoulders for rank. Officers who weren’t from Dalinar’s camp wore all\nkinds of clothing. It was difficult to pick them out from the merchants and\nother wealthy civilians.\nBut that doesn’t matter, Adolin told himself again. Because we’re not\ngoing to be attacked.\nHe frowned, passing a group of lighteyes lounging outside another\nwinehouse. Much as he’d just been doing. Their clothing—indeed, their\npostures and mannerisms—made them look like they cared only about their\nrevelry. Adolin found himself annoyed. There was a war going on. Almost\nevery day, soldiers died. They did so while lighteyes drank and chatted.\nMaybe the Codes weren’t just about protecting against the Parshendi.\nMaybe they were about something more—about giving the men\ncommanders they could respect and rely on. About treating war with the\ngravity it deserved. Maybe it was about not turning a war zone into a\nfestival. The common men had to remain on watch, vigilant. Therefore,\nAdolin and Dalinar did the same.\nAdolin hesitated in the street. Nobody cursed at him or called for him\nto move—they could see his rank. They just went around him.\nI think I see now, he thought. Why had it taken him so long?\nDisturbed, he hurried on his way toward the day’s match.\n“‘I walked from Abamabar to Urithiru,’” Dalinar said, quoting from\nmemory. “‘In this, the metaphor and experience are one, inseparable to me\nlike my mind and memory. One contains the other, and though I can explain\none to you, the other is only for me.’”\nSadeas—sitting beside him—raised an eyebrow. Elhokar sat on\nDalinar’s other side, wearing his Shardplate. He’d taken to that more and\nmore, sure that assassins were thirsting for his life. Together, they watched"

The rocky shelves running\naround the inside of the ten-foot-tall wall made excellent seating platforms.\nAdolin’s duel hadn’t started yet, and the men who fought right now\nwere lighteyes, but not Shardbearers. Their dull-edged dueling swords were\ncrusted with a white, chalklike substance. When one achieved a hit on the\nother’s padded armor, it would leave a visible mark.\n“So, wait,” Sadeas said to him. “This man who wrote the book…”\n“Nohadon is his holy name. Others call him Bajerden, though we’re\nnot certain whether that was actually his real name or not.”\n“He decided to walk from where to where?”\n“Abamabar to Urithiru,” Dalinar said. “I think it must have been a\ngreat distance, from the way the story is told.”\n“Wasn’t he a king?”\n“Yes.”\n“But why—”\n“It’s confusing,” Dalinar said. “But listen. You’ll see.” He cleared his\nthroat and continued. “‘I strode this insightful distance on my own, and\nforbade attendants. I had no steed beyond my well-worn sandals, no\ncompanion beside a stout staff to offer conversation with its beats against\nthe stone. My mouth was to be my purse; I stuffed it not with gems, but\nwith song. When singing for sustenance failed me, my arms worked well\nfor cleaning a floor or hogpen, and often earned me a satisfactory reward.\n“‘Those dear to me took fright for my safety and, perhaps, my sanity.\nKings, they explained, do not walk like beggars for hundreds of miles. My\nresponse was that if a beggar could manage the feat, then why not a king?\nDid they think me less capable than a beggar?\n“‘Sometimes I think that I am. The beggar knows much that the king\ncan only guess. And yet who draws up the codes for begging ordinances?\nOften I wonder what my experience in life—my easy life following the\nDesolation, and my current level of comfort—has given me of any true\nexperience to use in making laws. If we had to rely on what we knew, kings\nwould only be of use in creating laws regarding the proper heating of tea\nand cushioning of thrones.’”\nSadeas frowned at this. In front of them, the two swordsmen continued\ntheir duel; Elhokar watched keenly. He loved duels. Bringing in sand to\ncoat the floor of this arena had been one of his first acts at the Shattered\nPlains.\n“‘Regardless,’” Dalinar said, still quoting from The Way of Kings, “‘I\nmade the trip and—as the astute reader has already concluded—survived it.\nThe stories of its excitements will stain a different page in this narrative, for\nfirst I must explain my purpose in walking this strange path. Though I was\nquite willing to let my family think me insane, I would not leave the same\nas my cognomen upon the winds of history."

        "text": "first I must explain my purpose in walking this strange path. Though I was\nquite willing to let my family think me insane, I would not leave the same\nas my cognomen upon the winds of history.\n“‘My family traveled to Urithiru via the direct method, and had been\nawaiting me for weeks when I arrived. I was not recognized at the gate, for\nmy mane had grown quite robust without a razor to tame it. Once I revealed\nmyself, I was carried away, primped, fed, worried over, and scolded in\nprecisely that order. Only after all of this was through was I finally asked\nthe purpose of my excursion. Couldn’t I have just taken the simple, easy,\nand common route to the holy city?’”\n“Exactly,” Sadeas interjected. “He could at the very least have ridden a\nhorse!”\n“‘For my answer,’” Dalinar quoted, “‘I removed my sandals and\nproffered my callused feet. They were comfortable upon the table beside\nmy half-consumed tray of grapes. At this point, the expressions of my\ncompanions proclaimed that they thought me daft, and so I explained by\nrelating the stories of my trip. One after another, like stacked sacks of\ntallew, stored for the winter season. I would make flatbread of them soon,\nthen stuff it between these pages.\n“‘Yes, I could have traveled quickly. But all men have the same\nultimate destination. Whether we find our end in a hallowed sepulcher or a\npauper’s ditch, all save the Heralds themselves must dine with the\nNightwatcher.\n“‘And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I\ndeclare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road\nused to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that\nshapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of\nour travels, our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived.\n“‘In the end, I must proclaim that no good can be achieved of false\nmeans. For the substance of our existence is not in the achievement, but in\nthe method. The Monarch must understand this; he must not become so\nfocused on what he wishes to accomplish that he diverts his gaze from the\npath he must take to arrive there.’”\nDalinar sat back. The rock beneath them had been cushioned and\naugmented with wooden armrests and back supports. The duel ended with\none of the lighteyes—wearing green, as he was subject to Sadeas—scoring\na hit on the breastplate of the other, leaving a long white mark. Elhokar\nclapped his approval, gauntleted hands clanking, and both duelists bowed.\nThe winner’s victory would be recorded by the women sitting in the judging\nseats. They also held the books of dueling code, and would adjudicate\ndisputes or infractions.\n“That is the end of your story, I presume,” Sadeas said, as the next two\nduelists walked out onto the sand.\n“It is,” Dalinar said.\n“And you have that entire passage memorized?”\n“I likely got a few of the words wrong.”\n“Knowing you, that means you might have forgotten a single ‘an’ or\n‘the.’”\nDalinar frowned."

Of sorts.”\n“What did you think of the story?” Dalinar asked as the dueling\nresumed.\n“It was ridiculous,” Sadeas said frankly, waving for a servant to bring\nhim some wine. Yellow, as it was yet morning. “He walked all that distance\njust to make the point that kings should consider the consequences of their\ncommands?”\n“It wasn’t just to prove the point,” Dalinar said. “I thought that myself,\nbut I’ve begun to see. He walked because he wanted to experience the\nthings his people did. He used it as a metaphor, but I think he really wanted\nto know what it was like to walk that far.”\nSadeas took a sip of his wine, then squinted up at the sun. “Couldn’t\nwe get an awning or something set up out here?”\n“I like the sun,” Elhokar said. “I spend too much time locked away in\nthose caves we call buildings.”\nSadeas glanced at Dalinar, rolling his eyes.\n“Much of The Way of Kings is organized like that passage I quoted\nyou,” Dalinar said. “A metaphor from Nohadon’s life—a real event turned\ninto an example. He calls them the forty parables.”\n“Are they all so ridiculous?”\n“I think this one is beautiful,” Dalinar said softly.\n“I don’t doubt that you do. You always have loved sentimental stories.”\nHe raised a hand. “That was also intended to be a compliment.”\n“Of sorts?”\n“Exactly. Dalinar, my friend, you always have been emotional. It\nmakes you genuine. It can also get in the way of levelheaded thinking—but\nso long as it continues to prompt you to save my life, I think I can live with\nit.” He scratched his chin. “I suppose, by definition, I would have to,\nwouldn’t I?”\n“I guess.”\n“The other highprinces think you are self-righteous. Surely you can see\nwhy.”\n“I…” What could he say? “I don’t mean to be.”\n“Well, you do provoke them. Take, for example, the way you refuse to\nrise to their arguments or insults.”\n“Protesting simply draws attention to the issue,” Dalinar said. “The\nfinest defense of character is correct action. Acquaint yourself with virtue,\nand you can expect proper treatment from those around you.”\n“You see, there,” Sadeas said. “Who talks like that?”\n“Dalinar does,” Elhokar said, though he was still watching the dueling.\n“My father used to.”\n“Precisely,” Sadeas said. “Dalinar, friend, the others simply cannot\naccept that the things you say are serious. They assume it must be an act.”\n“And you? What do you think of me?”\n“I can see the truth.”\n“Which is?”\n“That you are a self-righteous prude,” Sadeas said lightly. “But you\ncome by it honestly.”\n“I’m certain you mean that to be a compliment too.”"

That was quite nearly clever.\nShall I have to name you the new Wit?”\n“What happened to the old one?” Sadeas’s voice was curious, even\neager, as if hoping to hear that tragedy had befallen Wit.\nElhokar’s grin became a scowl. “He vanished.”\n“Is that so? How disappointing.”\n“Bah.” Elhokar waved a gauntleted hand. “He does this on occasion.\nHe’ll return eventually. Unreliable as Damnation itself, that one. If he didn’t\nmake me laugh so, I’d have replaced him seasons ago.”\nThey fell silent, and the dueling continued. A few other lighteyes—\nboth women and men—watched, seated on the benchlike ridges. Dalinar\nnoted with discomfort that Navani had arrived, and was chatting with a\ngroup of women, including Adolin’s latest infatuation, the auburn-haired\nscribe.\nDalinar’s eyes lingered on Navani, drinking in her violet dress, her\nmature beauty. She’d recorded his most recent visions without complaint,\nand seemed to have forgiven him for throwing her out of his rooms so\nsharply. She never mocked him, never acted skeptical. He appreciated that.\nShould he thank her, or would she see that as an invitation?\nHe averted his gaze from her, but found that he couldn’t watch the\ndueling swordsmen without catching sight of her in the corner of his eye.\nSo, instead, he glanced up into the sky, squinting against the afternoon sun.\nThe sounds of metal hitting metal came from below. Behind him, several\nlarge snails clung to the rock, waiting for highstorm water.\nHe had so many questions, so many uncertainties. He listened to The\nWay of Kings and worked to discover what Gavilar’s last words had meant.\nAs if, somehow, they held the key to both his madness and the nature of the\nvisions. But the truth was that he didn’t know anything, and he couldn’t rely\non his own decisions. That was unhinging him, bit by bit, point by point.\nClouds seemed less frequent here, in these windswept plains. Just the\nblazing sun broken by the furious highstorms. The rest of Roshar was\ninfluenced by the storms—but here in the East, the feral, untamed\nhighstorms ruled supreme. Could any mortal king hope to claim these\nlands? There were legends of them being inhabited, of there being more\nthan just unclaimed hills, desolate plains, and overgrown forests. Natanatan,\nthe Granite Kingdom.\n“Ah,” Sadeas said, sounding as if he’d tasted something bitter. “Did he\nhave to come?”\nDalinar lowered his head and followed Sadeas’s gaze. Highprince\nVamah had arrived to watch the dueling, retinue in tow. Though most of\nthem wore his traditional brown and grey colorings, the highprince himself"

Though most of\nthem wore his traditional brown and grey colorings, the highprince himself\nwore a long grey coat that had slashes cut across it to reveal the bright red\nand orange silk underneath, matched by the ruffles peeking out of the cuffs\nand collar.\n“I thought you had a fondness for Vamah,” Elhokar said.\n“I tolerate him,” Sadeas replied. “But his fashion sense is absolutely\nrepulsive. Red and orange? Not even a burnt orange, but a blatant, eye-\nbreaking orange. And the rent style hasn’t been fashionable for ages. Ah,\nwonderful, he’s sitting directly across from us. I shall be forced to stare at\nhim for the rest of the session.”\n“You shouldn’t judge people so harshly based on how they look,”\nDalinar said.\n“Dalinar,” Sadeas said flatly, “we are highprinces. We represent\nAlethkar. Many around the world view us as a center of culture and\ninfluence. Should I not, therefore, have the right to encourage a\nproperpresentation to the world?”\n“A proper presentation, yes,” Dalinar said. “It is right for us to be fit\nand neat.” It would be nice if your soldiers, for instance, kept their uniforms\nclean.\n“Fit, neat, and fashionable,” Sadeas corrected.\n“And me?” Dalinar asked, looking down at his simple uniform.\n“Would you have me dress in those ruffles and bright colors?”\n“You?” Sadeas asked. “You’re completely hopeless.” He raised a hand\nto forestall objection. “No, I am unfair. That uniform has a certain…\ntimeless quality to it. The military suit, by virtue of its utility, will never be\ncompletely out of fashion. It’s a safe choice—steady. In a way, you avoid\nthe issue of fashion by not playing the game.” He nodded to Vamah.\n“Vamah tries to play, but does so very poorly. And that is unforgivable.”\n“I still say you place too much importance on those silks and scarves,”\nDalinar said. “We are soldiers at war, not courtiers at a ball.”\n“The Shattered Plains are quickly becoming a destination for foreign\ndignitaries. It is important to present ourselves properly.” He raised a finger\nto Dalinar. “If I am to accept your moral superiority, my friend, then\nperhaps it is time for you to accept my sense of fashion. One might note\nthat you judge people by their clothing even more than I do.”\nDalinar fell silent. That comment stung in its truthfulness. Still, if\ndignitaries were going to meet with the highprinces on the Shattered Plains,\nwas it too much to ask for them to find an efficient group of warcamps led\nby men who at least looked like generals?\nDalinar settled back to watch the match end. By his count, it was time\nfor Adolin’s bout. The two lighteyes who had been fighting bowed to the\nking, then withdrew into a tent on the side of the dueling grounds.

        "text": "moment later, Adolin stepped out onto the sand, wearing his deep blue\nShardplate. He carried his helm under his arm, his blond-and-black hair a\nstylish mess. He raised a gauntleted hand to Dalinar and bowed his head to\nthe king, then put on his helm.\nThe man who walked out behind him wore Shardplate painted yellow.\nBrightlord Resi was the only full Shardbearer in Highprince Thanadal’s\narmy—though their warcamp had three men who carried only the Blade or\nthe Plate. Thanadal himself had neither. It wasn’t uncommon for a\nhighprince to rely on his finest warriors as Shardbearers; it made sound\nsense, particularly if you were the sort of general who preferred to stay\nbehind the lines and direct tactics. In Thanadal’s own princedom, the\ntradition for centuries had been to appoint the holder of Resi’s Shards as\nsomething known as the Royal Defender.\nThanadal had recently been vocal about Dalinar’s faults, and so Adolin\n— in a moderately subtle move—had challenged the highprince’s star\nShardbearer to a friendly bout. Few duels were for Shards; in this case,\nlosing wouldn’t cost either man anything other than statistics in the\nrankings. The match drew an unusual amount of attention, and the small\narena filled over the next quarter hour while the duelists stretched and\nprepared. More than one woman set up a board to sketch or write\nimpressions of the bout. Thanadal himself didn’t attend.\nThe bout began as the highjudge in attendance, Lady Istow, called for\nthe combatants to summon their Blades. Elhokar leaned forward again,\nintent, as Resi and Adolin circled one another on the sand, Shardblades\nmaterializing. Dalinar found himself leaning forward as well, though he did\nfeel a stab of shame. According to the Codes, most duels should be avoided\nwhen Alethkar was at war. There was a fine line between sparring for\npractice and dueling another man for an insult, potentially leaving important\nofficers wounded.\nResi stood in Stonestance, his Shardblade held before him in two\nhands, point toward the sky, arms all the way extended. Adolin used\nWindstance, turned sideways slightly, hands before him and elbows bent,\nShardblade pointing back over his head. They circled. The winner would be\nthe first one who completely shattered a section of the other’s Plate. That\nwasn’t too dangerous; weakened Plate could usually still rebuff a blow,\neven if it shattered in the process.\nResi attacked first, taking a hopping leap forward and striking by\nwhipping his Shardblade back over his head, then down to his right in a\npowerful blow. Stonestance focused on that type of attack, delivering the\nmost possible momentum and strength behind each strike. Dalinar found it\nunwieldy—you didn’t need that much power behind a Shardblade on the\nbattlefield, though it was helpful against other Shardbearers.\nAdolin jumped back out of the way, Shardplate-enhanced legs giving\nhim a nimbleness that defied the fact that he was wearing over a hundred\nstoneweights of thick armor. Resi’s attack—though well-executed—left him\nopen, and Adolin made a careful strike at his opponent’s left vambrace,"

        "text": "stoneweights of thick armor. Resi’s attack—though well-executed—left him\nopen, and Adolin made a careful strike at his opponent’s left vambrace,\ncracking the forearm plate. Resi attacked again, and Adolin again danced\nout of the way, then scored a hit on his opponent’s left thigh.\nSome poets described combat as a dance. Dalinar rarely felt that way\nabout regular combat. Two men fighting with sword and shield would go at\none another in a furious rush, slamming their weapons down again and\nagain, tying to get around their opponent’s shield. Less a dance, and more\nlike wrestling with weapons.\nFighting with Shardblades, though, that could be like a dance. The\nlarge weapons took a great deal of skill to swing properly, and Plate was\nresilient, so exchanges were generally drawn out. The fights were filled with\ngrand motions, wide sweeps. There was a fluidity to fighting with a\nShardblade. A grace.\n“He’s quite good, you know,” Elhokar said. Adolin made a hit on\nResi’s helm, prompting a round of applause from those watching. “Better\nthan my father was. Better than even you, Uncle.”\n“He works very hard,” Dalinar said. “He truly loves it. Not the war, not\nthe fighting. The dueling.”\n“He could be champion, if he wished it.”\nAdolin did wish it, Dalinar knew. But he had refused bouts that would\nput him within reach of the title. Dalinar suspected that Adolin did it to\nhold, somewhat, to the Codes. Dueling championships and tournaments\nwere things for those rare times between wars. It could be argued that\nprotecting one’s family honor, however, was for all times.\nEither way, Adolin didn’t duel for ranking, and that made other\nShardbearers underestimate him. They were quick to accept duels with him,\nand some non-Shardbearers challenged him. By tradition, the king’s own\nShardplate and Blade were available for a large fee to those who both had\nhis favor and the wish to duel a Shardbearer.\nDalinar shivered at the thought of someone else wearing his Plate or\nholding Oathbringer. It was unnatural. And yet, the lending of the king’s\nBlade and Plate—or before the kingship had been restored, the lending of a\nhighprince’s Blade and Plate—was a strong tradition. Even Gavilar had not\nbroken it, though he had complained about it in private.\nAdolin dodged another blow, but he had begun to move into\nWindstance’s offensive forms. Resi wasn’t ready for this—though he\nmanaged to hit Adolin once on the right pauldron, the blow was a glancing\none. Adolin advanced, Blade sweeping in a fluid pattern. Resi backed away,\nfalling into a parrying posture—Stonestance was one of the few to rely on\nthose.\nAdolin batted his opponent’s Blade away, knocking it out of stance.\nResi reset, but Adolin knocked it away again. Resi grew sloppier and\nsloppier getting back into stance and Adolin began to strike, hitting him on\none side, then on the other. Small, quick blows, meant to unnerve.\nThey worked.

Adolin handled it perfectly,\ndropping his Blade to one hand, raising his left arm and taking the blow on\nhis unharmed vambrace. It cracked badly, but the move allowed Adolin to\nbring his own Blade to the side and strike Resi’s cracked left cuisse.\nThe thigh plate shattered with the sound of ripping metal, pieces\nblasting away, trailing smoke, glowing like molten steel. Resi stumbled\nback; his left leg could no longer bear the weight of the Shardplate. The\nmatch was over. More important duels might go for two or three broken\nplates, but that grew dangerous.\nThe highjudge stood, calling an end. Resi stumbled away, ripping off\nhis helm. His curses were audible. Adolin saluted his enemy, tapping the\nblunt edge of his Blade to his forehead, then dismissing the Blade. He\nbowed to the king. Other men sometimes went into the crowd to brag or\naccept accolades, but Adolin retreated to the preparation tent.\n“Talented indeed,” Elhokar said.\n“And such a… proper lad,” Sadeas said, sipping his drink.\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “At times, I wish there were peace, simply so that\nAdolin could dedicate himself to his dueling.”\nSadeas sighed. “More talk of abandoning the war, Dalinar?”\n“That’s not what I meant.”\n“You keep complaining that you’ve given up that argument, Uncle,”\nElhokar said, turning to regard him. “Yet you continue to dance around it,\nspeaking longingly of peace. People in the camps call you coward.”\nSadeas snorted. “He’s no coward, Your Majesty. I can attest to that.”\n“Why, then?” Elhokar asked.\n“These rumors have grown far beyond what is reasonable,” Dalinar\nsaid.\n“And yet, you do not answer my questions,” Elhokar said. “If you\ncould make the decision, Uncle, would you have us leave the Shattered\nPlains? Are you a coward?”\nDalinar hesitated.\nUnite them, that voice had told him. It is your task, and I give it to you.\nAm I a coward? he wondered. Nohadon challenged him, in the book,\nto examine himself. To never become so certain or high that he wasn’t\nwilling to seek truth.\nElhokar’s question hadn’t been about his visions. And yet, Dalinar had\nthe distinct impression that he was being a coward, at least in relation to his\ndesire to abdicate. If he left because of what was happening to him, that\nwould be taking the easy path.\nI can’t leave, he realized. No matter what happens. I have to see this\nthrough. Even if he was mad. Or, an increasingly worrisome thought, even\nif the visions were real, but their origins suspect. I have to stay. But I also\nhave to plan, to make sure I don’t tow my house down.\nSuch a careful line to walk. Nothing clear, everything clouded. He’d\nbeen ready to run because he liked to make clear decisions.

It seemed that in making the\ndecision to remain highprince, he placed one important cornerstone into\nrebuilding the foundation of who he was.\nHe would not abdicate. And that was that.\n“Dalinar?” Elhokar asked. “Are you… well?”\nDalinar blinked, realizing that he had stopped paying attention to the\nking and Sadeas. Staring off into space like that wouldn’t help his\nreputation. He turned to the king. “You want to know the truth,” he said.\n“Yes, if I could make the order, I would bring all ten warcamps and return\nto Alethkar.”\nDespite what others said, that was not cowardly. No, he’d just\nconfronted cowardice inside of him, and he knew what it was. This was\nsomething different.\nThe king looked shocked.\n“I would leave,” Dalinar said firmly. “But not because I wish to flee or\nbecause I fear battle. It would be because I fear for Alethkar’s stability;\nleaving this war would help secure our homeland and the loyalty of the\nhighprinces. I would send more envoys and scholars to find out why the\nParshendi killed Gavilar. We gave up on that too easily. I still wonder if the\nassassination was initiated by miscreants or rebels among their own people.\n“I’d discover what their culture is—and yes, they do have one. If\nrebels weren’t the cause of the assassination, I’d keep asking until I learned\nwhy they did it. I’d demand repayment—perhaps their own king, delivered\nto us for execution in turn—in exchange for granting them peace. As for the\ngemhearts, I’d speak with my scientists and discover a better method of\nholding this territory. Perhaps with mass homesteading of the area, securing\nall of the Unclaimed Hills, we could truly expand our borders and claim the\nShattered Plains. I wouldn’t abandon vengeance, Your Majesty, but I would\napproach it—and our war here—more thoughtfully. Right now, we know\ntoo little to be effective.”\nElhokar looked surprised. He nodded. “I… Uncle, that actually makes\nsense. Why didn’t you explain it before?”\nDalinar blinked. Just several weeks ago, Elhokar had been indignant\nwhen Dalinar had merely mentioned the idea of turning back. What had\nchanged?\nI don’t give the boy enough credit, he realized. “I have had trouble\nexplaining my own thoughts recently, Your Majesty.”\n“Your Majesty!” Sadeas said. “Surely you wouldn’t actually consider\n—”\n“This latest attempt on my life has me unsettled, Sadeas. Tell me. Have\nyou made any progress in determining who put the weakened gems in my\nPlate?”\n“Not yet, Your Majesty.”\n“They’re trying to kill me,” Elhokar said softly, huddling down in his\narmor. “They’ll see me dead, like my father. Sometimes I do wonder if\nwe’re chasing after the ten fools here. The assassin in white—he was Shin.”"

It would be a perfect distraction, pinning the blame on a group\nof parshmen. We go to war for years and years, never noticing the real\nvillains, working quietly in my own camp. They watch me.

Was\nElhokar’s paranoia growing worse, or had it always been hidden? He saw\nphantom cabals in every shadow, and now—with the attempt on his life—\nhe had proof to feed those worries.\n“Retreating from the Shattered Plains could be a good idea,” Dalinar\nsaid carefully. “But not if it is to begin another war with someone else. We\nmust stabilize and unify our people.”\nElhokar sighed. “Chasing the assassin is only an idle thought right\nnow. Perhaps we won’t need it. I hear that your eff orts with Sadeas have\nbeen fruitful.”\n“They have indeed, Your Majesty,” Sadeas said, sounding proud—\nperhaps a little smug. “Though Dalinar still insists on using his own, slow\nbridges. Sometimes, my forces are nearly wiped out before he arrives. This\nwould work better if Dalinar would use modern bridge tactics.”\n“The waste of life…” Dalinar said.\n“Is acceptable,” Sadeas said. “They’re mostly slaves, Dalinar. It’s an\nhonor for them to have a chance to participate in some small way.”\nI doubt they see it in that light.\n“I wish you’d at least try my way,” Sadeas continued. “What we’ve\nbeen doing so far has worked, but I worry that the Parshendi will continue\nto send two armies against us. I don’t relish the idea of fighting both on my\nown before you arrive.”\nDalinar hesitated. That would be a problem. But to give up the siege\nbridges?\n“Well, why not a compromise?” Elhokar said. “Next plateau assault,\nUncle, you let Sadeas’s bridgemen help you for the initial march to the\ncontested plateau. Sadeas has plenty of extra bridge crews he could lend\nyou. He could still rush on ahead with a smaller army, but you’d follow\nmore quickly than you have been, using his bridge crews.”\n“That would be the same as using my own bridge crews,” Dalinar said.\n“Not necessarily,” Elhokar said. “You’ve said that the Parshendi can\nrarely set up and fire on you once Sadeas engages them. Sadeas’s men can\nstart the assault as usual, and you can join once he’s secured a foothold for\nyou.”\n“Yes…” Sadeas said, thoughtful. “The bridgemen you use will be safe,\nand you won’t be costing any additional lives. But you’ll arrive at the\nplateau to help me twice as quickly.”\n“What if you can’t distract the Parshendi well enough?” Dalinar asked."

But at least we’ll have tried. This is how you get ahead, old\nfriend. You try new things.”\nDalinar scratched his chin in thought.\n“Oh, go on, Dalinar,” Elhokar said. “He took your suggestion to attack\ntogether. Try it once his way.”\n“Very well,” Dalinar said. “We will see how it works.”\n“Excellent,” Elhokar said, standing. “And now, I believe I’ll go\ncongratulate your son. That bout was exciting!”\nDalinar hadn’t found it particularly exciting—Adolin’s opponent\nhadn’t ever held the upper hand. But that was the best kind of battle.\nDalinar didn’t buy the arguments about a ‘good’ fight being a close one.\nWhen you won, it was always better to win quickly and with extreme\nadvantage.\nDalinar and Sadeas stood in respect as the king descended the stairlike\nstone outcroppings toward the sandy floor below. Dalinar then turned to\nSadeas. “I should be leaving. Send me a clerk to detail the plateaus you feel\nwe could try this maneuver on. Next time one of them is up for assault, I’ll\nmarch my army to your staging area and we’ll leave together. You and the\nsmaller, quicker group can go on ahead, and we’ll catch up once you’re in\nposition.”\nSadeas nodded.\nDalinar turned to climb up the steps toward the ramp out.\n“Dalinar,” Sadeas called after him.\nDalinar looked back at the other highprince. Sadeas’s scarf fluttered in\na gust of wind, his arms folded, the metallic golden embroidery glistening.\n“Send me one of your clerks as well. With a copy of that book of Gavilar’s.\nIt may amuse me to hear its other stories.”\nDalinar smiled. “I will do so, Sadeas.”\n“Above the final void I hang, friends behind, friends before. The feast I\nmust drink clings to their faces, and the words I must speak spark in\nmy mind. The old oaths will be spoken anew.”\n—Dated Betabanan, 1173, 45 seconds pre-death. Subject: a lighteyed\nchild of five years. Diction improved remarkably when giving sample.\nKaladin glared at the three glowing topaz spheres on the ground in front of\nhim. The barrack was dark, empty save for Teft and himself. Lopen leaned\nin the sunlit doorway, watching with a casual air. Outside, Rock called out\ncommands to the other bridgemen. Kaladin had them working on battle\nformations. Nothing overt. It would be construed as practice for bridge\ncarrying, but he was actually training them to obey orders and rearrange\nthemselves efficiently.\nThe three little spheres—only chips—lit the stone ground around\nthemselves in little tan rings. Kaladin focused on them, holding his breath,\nwilling the light into him."

Kaladin focused on them, holding his breath,\nwilling the light into him.\nNothing happened.\nHe tried harder, staring into their depths.\nNothing happened.\nHe picked one up, cupping it in his palm, raising it so that he could see\nthe light and nothing else. He could pick out the details of the storm, the\nshifting, spinning vortex of light. He commanded it, willed it, begged it.\nNothing happened.\nHe groaned, lying back on the rock, staring at the ceiling.\n“Maybe you don’t want it badly enough,” Teft said.\n“I want it as badly as I know how. It won’t budge, Teft.”\nTeft grunted and picked up one of the spheres.\n“Maybe we’re wrong about me,” Kaladin said. It seemed poetically\nappropriate that the moment he accepted this strange, frightening part of\nhimself, he couldn’t make it work. “It could have been a trick of the\nsunlight.”\n“A trick of the sunlight,” Teft said flatly. “Sticking a bag to the barrel\nwas a trick of the light.”\n“All right. Then maybe it was some odd fluke, something that\nhappened just that once.”\n“And when you were wounded,” Teft said, “and whenever on a bridge\nrun you needed an extra burst of strength or endurance.”\nKaladin let out a frustrated sigh and tapped his head back lightly\nagainst the rock floor a few times. “Well, if I’m one of these Radiants you\nkeep talking about, why can’t I do anything?”\n“I figure,” the grizzled bridgeman said, rolling the sphere in his\nfingers, “that you’re like a baby, making his legs work. At first it just kind\nof happens. Slowly, he figures how to make them move on purpose. You\njust need practice.”\n“I’ve spent a week staring at spheres, Teft. How much practice can it\ntake?”\n“Well, more than you’ve had, obviously.”\nKaladin rolled his eyes and sat back up. “Why am I listening to you?\nYou’ve admitted that you don’t know any more than I do.”\n“I don’t know anything about using the Stormlight,” Teft said,\nscowling. “But I know what should happen.”\n“According to stories that contradict one another. You’ve told me that\nthe Radiants could fly and walk on walls.”\nTeft nodded. “They sure could. And make stone melt by looking at it.\nAnd move great distances in a single heartbeat. And command the sunlight.\nAnd—”\n“And why,” Kaladin said, “would they need to both walk on walls and\nfly? If they can fly, why would they bother running up walls?”\nTeft said nothing.\n“And why bother with either one,” Kaladin added, “if they can just\n‘move great distances in a heartbeat’?”\n“I’m not sure,” Teft admitted.\n“We can’t trust the stories or legends,” Kaladin said. He glanced at Syl,\nwho had landed beside one of the spheres, staring at it with childlike\ninterest. “Who knows what is true and what has been fabricated?

The only\nthing we know for certain is this.” He plucked up one of the spheres and\nheld it up in two fingers. “The Radiant sitting in this room is very, very tired\nof the color brown.”\nTeft grunted. “You’re not a Radiant, lad.”\n“Weren’t we just talking about—”\n“Oh, you can infuse,” Teft said. “You can drink in the Stormlight and\ncommand it. But being a Radiant was more than that. It was their way of\nlife, the things they did. The Immortal Words.”\n“The what?”\nTeft rolled his sphere between his fingers again, holding it up and\nstaring into its depths. “Life before death. Strength before weakness.\nJourney before destination. That was their motto, and was the First Ideal of\nthe Immortal Words. There were four others.”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow. “Which were?”\n“I don’t actually know,” Teft said. “But the Immortal Words—these\nIdeals—guided everything they did. The four later Ideals were said to be\ndifferent for every order of Radiants. But the First Ideal was the same for\neach of the ten: Life before death, strength before weakness, journey before\ndestination.” He hesitated. “Or so I was told.”\n“Yes, well, that seems a little obvious to me,” Kaladin said. “Life\ncomes before death. Just like day comes before night, or one comes before\ntwo. Obvious.”\n“You’re not taking this seriously. Maybe that’s why the Stormlight\nrefuses you.”\nKaladin stood and stretched. “I’m sorry, Teft. I’m just tired.”\n“Life before death,” Teft said, wagging a finger at Kaladin. “The\nRadiant seeks to defend life, always. He never kills unnecessarily, and\nnever risks his own life for frivolous reasons. Living is harder than dying.\nThe Radiant’s duty is to live.\n“Strength before weakness. All men are weak at some time in their\nlives. The Radiant protects those who are weak, and uses his strength for\nothers. Strength does not make one capable of rule; it makes one capable of\nservice.”\nTeft picked up spheres, putting them in his pouch. He held the last one\nfor a second, then tucked it away too. “Journey before destination. There\nare always several ways to achieve a goal. Failure is preferable to winning\nthrough unjust means. Protecting ten innocents is not worth killing one. In\nthe end, all men die. How you lived will be far more important to the\nAlmighty than what you accomplished.”\n“The Almighty? So the knights were tied to religion?”\n“Isn’t everything? There was some old king who came up with all this.\nHad his wife write it in a book or something. My mother read it. The\nRadiants based the Ideals on what was written there.”\nKaladin shrugged, moving over to begin sorting through the pile of\nbridgemen’s leather vests. Ostensibly, he and Teft were here checking those\nover for tears or broken straps. After a few moments, Teft joined him.\n“Do you actually believe that?” Kaladin asked, lifting up a vest,\ntugging on its straps. “That anyone would follow those vows, particularly a\nbunch of lighteyes?”"

They were Radiants.”\n“They were people,” Kaladin said. “Men in power always pretend\nthings like virtue, or divine guidance, some kind of mandate to ‘protect’ the\nrest of us. If we believe that the Almighty put them where they are, it’s\neasier for us to swallow what they do to us.”\nTeft turned a vest over. It was beginning to tear beneath the left\nshoulder pad. “I never used to believe. And then… then I saw you infusing\nLight, and I began to wonder.”\n“Stories and legends, Teft,” Kaladin said. “We want to believe that\nthere were better men once. That makes us think it could be that way again.\nBut people don’t change. They are corrupt now. They were corrupt then.”\n“Maybe,” Teft said. “My parents believed in all of it. The Immortal\nWords, the Ideals, the Knights Radiant, the Almighty. Even old Vorinism. In\nfact, especially old Vorinism.”\n“That led to the Hierocracy. The devotaries and the ardents shouldn’t\nhold land or property. It’s too dangerous.”\nTeft snorted. “Why? You think they’d be worse at being in charge than\nthe lighteyes?”\n“Well, you’ve probably got a point there.” Kaladin frowned. He’d\nspent so long assuming the Almighty had abandoned him, or even cursed\nhim, that it was difficult to accept that maybe—as Syl had said—he’d\ninstead been blessed. Yes, he’d been preserved, and he supposed he should\nbe grateful for that. But what could be worse than being granted great\npower, yet still being too weak to save those he loved?\nFurther speculation was interrupted as Lopen stood up straight in the\ndoorway, gesturing covertly to Kaladin and Teft. Fortunately, there wasn’t\nanything to hide anymore. In fact, there hadn’t ever been anything to hide,\nother than Kaladin sitting on the floor and staring at the spheres like an\nidiot. He set aside the vest and walked to the entrance.\nHashal’s palanquin was being carried directly toward Kaladin’s\nbarrack, her tall, oft-silent husband walking alongside. The sash at his neck\nwas violet, as was the embroidery on the cuffs of his short, vestlike jacket.\nGaz still hadn’t reappeared. It had been a week now, and no sign of him.\nHashal and her husband—along with their lighteyed attendants—did what\nhe’d once done, and they rebuffed any questions about the bridge sergeant.\n“Storm it,” Teft said, stepping up beside Kaladin. “Those two make my\nskin itch, same way it does when I know someone’s got a knife and is\nstanding behind me.”\nRock had the bridgemen lined up and waiting quietly, as if for\ninspection. Kaladin walked out to join them, Teft and Lopen following\nbehind. The bearers set the palanquin down in front of Kaladin. Open-sided\nwith only a small canopy on the top, it was little more than an armchair on a\nplatform. Many of the lighteyed women used them in the warcamps."

Many of the lighteyed women used them in the warcamps.\nKaladin reluctantly gave Hashal a proper bow, prompting the other\nbridgemen to do so as well. Now was not the time to be beaten for\ninsubordination.\n“You have such a well-trained band, bridgeleader,” she said, idly\nscratching her cheek with a ruby-red nail, her elbow on her armrest. “So…\nefficient at bridge runs.”\n“Thank you, Brightness Hashal,” Kaladin said, trying—but failing—to\nkeep the stiff ness and hostility from his voice. “May I ask? Gaz hasn’t been\nseen for some days now. Is he well?”\n“No.” Kaladin waited for further reply, but she didn’t give one. “My\nhusband has made a decision. Your men are so good at bridge runs that you\nare a model to the other crews. As such, you will be on bridge duty every\nday from now on.”\nKaladin felt a chill. “And scavenging duty?”\n“Oh, there will still be time for that. You need to take torches down\nanyway, and plateau runs never happen at night. So your men will sleep\nduring the day—always on call—and will work the chasms at night. A\nmuch better use of your time.”\n“Every bridge run,” Kaladin said. “You’re going to make us go on\nevery one.”\n“Yes,” she said idly, tapping for her bearers to raise her. “Your team is\njust too good. It must be used. You’ll start full-time bridge duty tomorrow.\nConsider it an… honor.”\nKaladin inhaled sharply to keep himself from saying what he thought\nof her “honor.” He couldn’t bring himself to bow as she retreated, but she\ndidn’t seem to care. Rock and the men started muttering.\nEvery bridge run. She’d just doubled the rate at which they’d be killed.\nKaladin’s team wouldn’t last another few weeks. They were already so low\non members that losing one or two men on an assault would cause them to\nflounder. The Parshendi would focus on them then, cutting them down.\n“Kelek’s breath!” Teft said. “She’ll see us dead!”\n“It’s not fair,” Lopen added.\n“We’re bridgemen,” Kaladin said, looking at them. “What made you\nthink that any kind of ‘fairness’ applied to us?”\n“She hasn’t killed us fast enough for Sadeas,” Moash said. “You know\nthat soldiers have been beaten for coming to look for you, to see the man\nwho survived the highstorm? He hasn’t forgotten about you, Kaladin.”\nTeft was still swearing. He pulled Kaladin aside, Lopen following, but\nthe others remained talking among themselves. “Damnation!” Teft said\nsoftly. “They like to pretend to be evenhanded with the bridge crews.\nMakes ’em seem fair. Looks like they gave up on that. Bastards.”\n“What do we do, gancho?” Lopen asked.\n“We go to the chasms,” Kaladin said. “Just like we’re scheduled to.\nThen make sure we get some extra sleep tonight, as we’re apparently going\nto be staying up all night tomorrow.”"

It was only him, Kaladin, and Lopen. “It will\nbe another few weeks at least.”\n“I know.”\n“We won’t last another few weeks!” Teft said. “With Sadeas and\nKholin working together, runs happen nearly every day. Just one bad run—\none time with the Parshendi drawing bead on us—and it will all be over.\nWe’ll be wiped out.”\n“I know!” Kaladin said, frustrated, taking a deep breath and forming\nfists to keep himself from exploding.\n“Gancho!” Lopen said.\n“What?” Kaladin snapped.\n“It’s happening again.”\nKaladin froze, then looked down at his arms. Sure enough, he caught a\nhint of luminescent smoke rising from his skin. It was extremely faint—he\ndidn’t have many gemstones near him—but it was there. The wisps faded\nquickly. Hopefully the other bridgemen hadn’t seen.\n“Damnation. What did I do?”\n“I don’t know,” Teft said. “Is it because you were angry at Hashal?”\n“I was angry before.”\n“You breathed it in,” Syl said eagerly, whipping around him in the air,\na ribbon of light.\n“What?”\n“I saw it.” She twisted herself around. “You were mad, you drew in a\nbreath, and the Light… it came too.”\nKaladin glanced at Teft, but of course the older bridgeman hadn’t\nheard. “Gather the men,” Kaladin said. “We’re going down to our chasm\nduty.”\n“And what about what has happened?” Teft said. “Kaladin, we can’t go\non that many bridge runs. We’ll be cut to pieces.”\n“I’m doing something about it today. Gather the men. Syl, I need\nsomething from you.”\n“What?” She landed in front of him and formed into a young woman.\n“Go find us a place where some Parshendi corpses have fallen.”\n“I thought you were going to do spear practice today.”\n“That’s what the men will be doing,” Kaladin said. “I’ll get them\norganized first. After that, I have a different task.”\nKaladin clapped a quick signal, and the bridgemen made a decent\narrowhead formation. They carried the spears they’d stashed in the chasm,\nsecured in a large sack filled with stones and stuck in a crevice. He clapped\nhis hands again, and they rearranged into a double-line wall formation. He\nclapped again, and they formed into a ring with one man standing behind\nevery two as a quick step-in reserve.\nThe walls of the chasm dripped with water, and the bridgemen\nsplashed through puddles.

Until then, they were just\nbridgemen who could move in fancy patterns. They needed more time.\nKaladin had to buy them some.\n“Teft,” Kaladin said. “Take over.”\nThe older bridgeman gave one of those cross-armed salutes.\n“Syl,” Kaladin said to the spren, “let’s go see these bodies.”\n“They’re close. Come on.” She zipped off down the chasm, a glowing\nribbon. Kaladin started after her.\n“Sir,” Teft called.\nKaladin hesitated. When had Teft started calling him “sir”? Odd, how\nright that felt. “Yes?”\n“You want an escort?” Teft stood at the head of the gathered\nbridgemen, who were looking more and more like soldiers, with their\nleather vests and spears held in practiced grips.\nKaladin shook his head. “I’ll be fine.”\n“Chasmfiends…”\n“The lighteyes have killed any who prowl this close to our side.\nBesides, if I did run into one, what difference would two or three extra men\nmake?”\nTeft grimaced behind his short, greying beard, but offered no further\nobjection. Kaladin continued to follow Syl. In his pouch, he carried the rest\nof the spheres they’d discovered on bodies while scavenging. They made a\nhabit of keeping some of each discovery and sticking them to bridges, and\nwith Syl helping at scavenging, they now found more than they used to. He\nhad a small fortune in his pouch. That Stormlight—he hoped— would serve\nhim well today.\nHe got out a sapphire mark for light, avoiding pools of water strewn\nwith bones. A skull protruded from one, wavy green moss growing across\nthe scalp like hair, lifespren bobbing above. Perhaps it should have felt eerie\nto walk through these darkened slots alone, but they didn’t bother Kaladin.\nThis was a sacred place, the sarcophagus of the lowly, the burial cavern of\nbridgemen and spearmen who died upon lighteyed edicts, spilling blood\ndown the sides of these ragged walls. This place wasn’t eerie; it was holy.\nHe was actually glad to be alone with his silence and the remains of\nthose who had died. These men hadn’t cared about the squabbles of those\nborn with lighter eyes than they. These men had cared about their families\nor—at the very least—their sphere pouches. How many of them were\ntrapped in this foreign land, these endless plateaus, too poor to escape back\nto Alethkar? Hundreds died each week, winning gems for men who were\nalready rich, winning vengeance for a king long dead.\nKaladin passed another skull, missing its lower jaw, the crown split by\nan axe’s blow.

Each man would do as he had done in life. Spearmen to\nfight, farmers to work spiritual farms, lighteyes to lead. The ardents were\ncareful to point out that excellence in any Calling would bring power. A\nfarmer would be able to wave his hand and create great fields of spiritual\ncrops. A spearman would be a great warrior, able to cause thunder with his\nshield and lightning with his spear.\nBut what of the bridgemen? Would the Almighty demand that all of\nthese fallen rise and continue their drudgery? Would Dunny and the others\nrun bridges in the afterlife? No ardents came to them to test their abilities or\ngrant them Elevations. Perhaps the bridgemen wouldn’t be needed in the\nWar for Heaven. Only the very most skilled went there anyway. Others\nwould simply slumber until the Tranquiline Halls were reclaimed.\nSo do I believe again now? He climbed over a boulder wedged in the\nchasm. Just like that? He wasn’t sure. But it didn’t matter. He would do the\nbest he could for his bridgemen.

Why did they have to rely on dreams and\nfabrications for inspiration?\nIf you flee… you leave all the other bridgemen to be slaughtered, a\nvoice whispered within him.

And then—feeling completely natural about it—Kaladin\nbreathed in deeply. The sphere grew cold and a wave of heat shot up his\narm.\nHe opened his eyes. The sphere in his hand was dun and his fingers\nwere crispy with frost. Light rose from him like smoke from a fire, white,\npure.\nHe raised a hand and felt alive with energy.

Raging inside his veins, a tempest sweeping about inside\nhis chest cavity. It made him want to run, jump, yell. It almost made him\nwant to burst. He felt as if he could walk on air. Or walls.\nYes! he thought. He broke into a run, leaping at the side of the chasm.\nHe hit feetfirst.\nThen bounced off and slammed back into the ground. He was so\nstunned that he cried out, and he felt the storm within dampen as breath\nescaped.\nHe lay on his back as Stormlight rose from him more quickly now that\nhe was breathing. He lay there as the last of it burned away.\nSyl landed on his chest. “Kaladin? What was that?”\n“Me being an idiot,” he replied, sitting up and feeling an ache in his\nback and a sharp pain in his elbow where he’d hit the ground. “Teft said that\nthe Radiants were able to walk on walls, and I felt so alive….”\nSyl walked on air, stepping as if down a set of stairs. “I don’t think\nyou’re ready for that yet. Don’t be so risky. If you die, I go stupid again,\nyou know.”\n“I’ll try to keep that in mind,” Kaladin said, climbing to his feet.\n“Maybe I’ll remove dying from my list of tasks to do this week.”\nShe snorted, zipping into the air, becoming a ribbon again. “Come on,\nhurry up.” She shot off down the chasm. Kaladin collected the dun sphere,\nthen dug into the pouch for another one to provide light. Had he drained\nthem all? No. The others still glowed strongly. He selected a ruby mark,\nthen hurried after Syl.\nShe led him to a narrow chasm that contained a small group of fresh\nParshendi corpses. “This is morbid, Kaladin,” Syl noted, standing above the\nbodies.\n“I know. Do you know where Lopen went?”\n“I sent him scavenging nearby, fetching the things you asked him for.”\n“Bring him, please.”\nSyl sighed, but zipped away. She always got testy when he made her\nappear to someone other than him. Kaladin knelt down. Parshendi all\nlooked so similar. That same square face, those blocky—almost rocklike—\nfeatures. Some had the beards with bits of gemstone tied in them. Those\nglowed, but not brightly. Cut gemstones held Stormlight better. Why was\nthat?\nRumors in camp claimed that the Parshendi took the wounded humans\naway and ate them. Rumors also said they left their dead, not caring for the\nfallen, never building them proper pyres. But that last part was false. They\ndid care about their dead. They all seemed to have the same sensibility that\nShen did; he threw a fit every time one of the bridgemen so much as\ntouched a Parshendi corpse.\nI’d better be right about this, Kaladin thought grimly, slipping a knife\noff one of the Parshendi bodies.

It was beautifully ornamented and forged,\nthe steel lined with glyphs Kaladin didn’t recognize. He began to cut at the\nstrange breastplate armor that grew from the corpse’s chest.\nKaladin quickly determined that Parshendi physiology was very\ndifferent from human physiology. Small blue ligaments held the breastplate\nto the skin underneath. It was attached all the way across. He continued\nworking. There wasn’t much blood; it had pooled at the corpse’s back or\nleaked away. His knife wasn’t a surgeon’s tool, but it did the job just fine.\nBy the time Syl returned with Lopen, Kaladin had gotten the breastplate\nfree and had moved on to the carapace helm. It was harder to remove; it had\ngrown into the skull in places, and he had to saw with the serrated section\nof the blade.\n“Ho, gancho,” Lopen said, a sack slung over his shoulder. “You don’t\nlike them at all, do you?”\nKaladin stood, wiping his hands on the Parshendi man’s skirt. “Did\nyou find what I asked for?”\n“Sure did,” Lopen said, letting down the sack and digging into it. He\npulled out an armored leather vest and cap, the type that spearmen used.\nThen he took out some thin leather straps and a medium-sized wooden\nspearman’s shield. Finally came a series of deep red bones. Parshendi\nbones. At the very bottom of the sack was the rope, the one Lopen had\nbought and tossed into the chasm, then stashed down below.\n“You haven’t lost your wits, have you?” Lopen asked, eyeing the\nbones. “Because if you have, I’ve got a cousin who makes this drink for\npeople who’ve lost their wits, and it might make you better, sure.”\n“If I’d lost my wits,” Kaladin said, walking over to a pool of still water\nto wash off the carapace helm, “would I say that I had?”\n“I don’t know,” Lopen said, leaning back. “Maybe. Guess it doesn’t\nmatter if you’re crazy or not.”\n“You’d follow a crazy man into battle?”\n“Sure,” Lopen said. “If you’re crazy, you’re a good type, and I like\nyou. Not a killing-people-in-their-sleep type of crazy.” He smiled. “Besides.\nWe all follow crazies all the time. Do it every day with lighteyes.”\nKaladin chuckled.\n“So what’s this all for?”\nKaladin didn’t answer. He brought the breastplate over to the leather\nvest, then tied it onto the front with some of the leather straps. He did the\nsame with the cap and the helm, though he eventually had to saw some\ngrooves into the helm with his knife to make it stay.\nOnce done, Kaladin used the last straps to tie the bones together and\nattach them to the front of the round wooden shield. The bones rattled as he\nlifted the shield, but he decided it was good enough.\nHe took shield, cap, and breastplate and put them all into Lopen’s sack."

One bridge in\nparticular was close to Sadeas’s warcamp—so they often traversed it on the\nway out on a bridge run—and spanned a particularly shallow chasm. Only\nabout forty feet deep, rather than the usual hundred or more.\nShe nodded, then zipped away, leading them there. Kaladin and Lopen\nfollowed. Teft had orders to lead the others back and meet Kaladin at the\nbase of the ladder, but Kaladin and Lopen should be far ahead of them. He\nspent the hike listening with half an ear as Lopen talked about his extended\nfamily.\nThe more Kaladin thought about what he was planning, the more\nbrazen it seemed. Perhaps Lopen was right to question his sanity. But\nKaladin had tried being rational. He’d tried being careful. That had failed;\nnow there wasn’t any more time for logic or care. Hashal obviously\nintended Bridge Four to be exterminated.\nWhen clever, careful plans failed, it was time to try something\ndesperate.\nLopen cut off suddenly. Kaladin hesitated. The Herdazian man had\ngrown pale-faced and frozen in place. What was…\nScraping. Kaladin froze as well, a panic rising in him. One of the side\ncorridors echoed with a deep grinding sound. Kaladin turned slowly, just in\ntime to catch sight of something large—no, something enormous— moving\ndown the distant chasm. Shadows in the dim light, the sound of chitinous\nlegs scratching on rock. Kaladin held his breath, sweating, but the beast\ndidn’t come in their direction.\nThe scraping grew softer, then eventually faded. He and Lopen stood\nimmobile for a long time after the last sound had vanished.\nFinally, Lopen spoke. “Guess the nearby ones aren’t all dead, eh,\ngancho?”\n“Yeah,” Kaladin said. He jumped suddenly as Syl zipped back to find\nthem. He unconsciously sucked in Stormlight as he did so, and when she\nalighted in the air, she found him sheepishly glowing.\n“What is going on?” she demanded, hands on hips.\n“Chasmfiend,” Kaladin said.\n“Really?” She sounded excited. “We should chase after it!”\n“What?”\n“Sure,” she said. “You could fight it, I’ll bet.”\n“Syl…”\nHer eyes were twinkling with amusement. Just a joke. “Come on.” She\nzipped away.\nHe and Lopen stepped more softly now. Eventually Syl landed on the\nside of the chasm, standing there as if in mockery of when Kaladin had tried\nto walk up the wall.\nKaladin looked up at the shadow of a wooden bridge forty feet above.\nThis was the shallowest chasm they’d been able to find; they tended to get\ndeeper and deeper the farther eastward you went.

It was too far, and\nsurviving the highstorm floods was too difficult a challenge. The original\nplan—fighting or bribing the guards, then running—was the best one.\nBut they needed to live long enough to try that. The bridge above\noffered an opportunity, if Kaladin could reach it. He hefted his small bag of\nspheres and his slung sack full of armor and bones over his shoulder. He’d\noriginally intended to have Rock shoot an arrow with a rope tied to it over\nthe bridge, then back down into the chasm. With some men holding one\nend, another could have climbed up and tied the sack to the bridge’s\nunderside.\nBut that would risk letting an arrow shoot out of the chasm where\nscouts could see. They were said to be very keen-eyed, as the armies\ndepended on them to spot chasmfiends making chrysalises.\nKaladin thought he had a better way than the arrow. Maybe. “We need\nrocks,” he said. “Fist-size ones. A lot of them.”\nLopen shrugged and began searching about. Kaladin joined him,\nfishing them out of puddles and pulling them from crevasses. There was no\nshortage of stones in the chasms. In a short time, he had a large pile of rocks\nin a sack.\nHe took the pouch of spheres in his hand and tried to think the same\nway he had earlier, when he’d drawn in the Stormlight. This is our last\nchance.\n“Life before death,” he whispered. “Strength before weakness. Journey\nbefore destination.”\nThe First Ideal of the Knights Radiant. He breathed in deeply, and a\nthick jolt of power shot up his arm. His muscles burned with energy, with\nthe desire to move. The tempest spread within, pushing at his skin, causing\nhis blood to pump in a powerful rhythm. He opened his eyes. Glowing\nsmoke rose around him. He was able to contain much of the Light, holding\nit in by holding his breath.\nIt’s like a storm inside me. It felt as if it would rip him apart.\nHe set the sack with the armor on the ground, but wound the rope\naround his arm and tied the sack of rocks to his belt. He took out a single\nfist-size stone and hefted it, feeling its storm-smoothed sides. This had\nbetter work….\nHe infused the stone with Stormlight, frost crystallizing on his arm. He\nwasn’t sure how he did it, but it felt natural, like pouring liquid into a cup.\nLight seemed to pool underneath the skin of his hand, then transfer to the\nrock—as if he were painting it with a vibrant, glowing liquid.\nHe pressed the stone to the rock wall. It fixed in place, leaking\nStormlight, clinging so strongly that he couldn’t pry it free. He tested his\nweight on it, and it held. He placed another one a little lower, then another a\nlittle higher. Then, wishing he had someone to burn him a prayer for\nsuccess, he started climbing.\nHe tried not to think about what he was doing. Climbing on rocks\nstuck to the wall by… what? Light? Spren?

It was a lot\nlike climbing the stone formations back near Hearthstone with Tien, except\nthat he could make handholds exactly where he wanted.\nShould have found some rock dust to cover my hands, he thought,\npulling himself up, then taking another stone from his sack and sticking it\ninto place.\nSyl walked along beside him, her casual stroll seeming to mock the\ndifficulty of his climb. As he shifted his weight to another rock, he heard an\nominous click from below. He risked a glance downward. The first of his\nrocks had fallen free. The ones near it were leaking Stormlight only faintly\nnow.\nThe rocks led up toward him like a set of burning footprints. The storm\ninside him had quieted, though it still blew and raged inside his veins,\nthrilling and distracting at the same time. What would happen if he ran out\nof Light before he reached the top?\nThe next rock fell free. The one beside it followed a few seconds later.\nLopen stood on the other side of the chasm bottom, leaning against the wall,\ninterested but relaxed.\nKeep moving! Kaladin thought, annoyed at himself for getting\ndistracted. He turned back to his work.\nJust as his arms were beginning to burn from the climb, he reached the\nunderside of the bridge. He reached out as two more of his stones fell free.\nThe clatter of each one was louder now, as they fell a much larger distance.\nSteadying himself on the bottom of the bridge with one hand, feet still\npushing against the highest rocks, he looped the end of the rope around a\nwooden bridge support. He pulled it around and threaded it through again to\nmake a makeshift knot. He left plenty of extra rope on the short end.\nHe let the rest of the rope slide free of his shoulder and drop to the\nfloor below. “Lopen,” he called. Light steamed from his mouth as he spoke.\n“Pull it tight.”\nThe Herdazian did so, and Kaladin held to his end, making the knot\nfirm. Then he took hold of the long section of rope and let himself swing\nfree, dangling from the bottom of the bridge. The knot held.\nKaladin relaxed. He was still steaming light, and—save for the call to\nLopen—he’d been holding his breath for a good quarter hour. That could be\nhandy, he thought, though his lungs were starting to burn, so he started to\nbreathe normally. The Light didn’t leave him altogether, though it escaped\nfaster.\n“All right,” Kaladin said to Lopen. “Tie the other sack to the bottom of\nthe rope.”\nThe rope wiggled, and a few moments later Lopen called up that it was\ndone. Kaladin gripped the rope with his legs to hold himself in place, then\nused his hands to pull up the length underneath, hoisting up the sack full of\narmor. Using the rope on the short end of the knot, he slipped his pouch of\ndun spheres into the sack with the armor, then tied it into place underneath\nthe bridge where—he hoped—Lopen and Dabbid would be able to get to it\nfrom above."

The ground looked so much more distant than it\nwould have from the bridge above. From this slightly different perspective,\neverything changed.\nHe didn’t get vertigo from the height. Instead, he felt a little surge of\nexcitement. Something about him had always liked being up high. It felt\nnatural. It was being below—trapped in holes and unable to see the world—\nthat was depressing.\nHe considered his next move.\n“What?” Syl asked, stepping up to him, standing on air.\n“If I leave the rope here, someone might spot it while crossing the\nbridge.”\n“So cut it free.”\nHe looked at her, raising an eyebrow. “While dangling from it?”\n“You’ll be fine.”\n“That’s a forty-foot drop! I’d break bones at the very least.”\n“No,” Syl said. “I feel right about this, Kaladin. You’ll be fine. Trust\nme.”\n“Trust you? Syl, you’ve said yourself that your memory is fractured!”\n“You insulted me the other week,” she said, folding her arms. “I think\nyou owe me an apology.”\n“I’m supposed to apologize by cutting a rope and dropping forty feet?”\n“No, you apologize by trusting me. I told you. I feel right about this.”\nHe sighed, looking down again. His Stormlight was running out. What\nelse could he do? Leaving the rope would be foolish. Could he tie it in\nanother knot, one he could shake free once at the bottom?\nIf that type of knot existed, he didn’t know how to tie it. He clenched\nhis teeth. Then, as the last of his rocks fell off and clattered to the ground,\nhe took a deep breath and pulled out the Parshendi knife he’d taken earlier.\nHe moved swiftly, before he had a chance to reconsider, and sliced the rope\nfree.\nHe dropped in a rush, one hand still holding the sliced rope, stomach\nlurching with the jarring distress of falling. The bridge shot away as if\nrising, and Kaladin’s panicked mind immediately sent his eyes downward.\nThis wasn’t beautiful. This was terrifying. It was horrible. He was going to\ndie! He—\nIt’s all right.\nHis emotions calmed in a heartbeat. Somehow, he knew what to do.\nHe twisted in the air, dropping the rope and hitting the ground with both\nfeet down. He came to a crouch, resting one hand on the stone, a jolt of\ncoldness shooting through him. His remaining Stormlight came out in a\nsingle burst, flung from his body in a luminescent smoke ring that crashed\nagainst the ground before spreading out, vanishing.\nHe stood up straight. Lopen gaped. Kaladin felt an ache in his legs\nfrom hitting, but it was like that of having leaped four or five feet.\n“Like ten crashes of thunder on the mounts, gancho!” Lopen\nexclaimed. “That was incredible!”\n“Thank you,” Kaladin said. He raised a hand to his head, glancing at\nthe rocks scattered about the base of the wall, then looking up at the armor\ntied securely up above."

She sounded\ntriumphant.\n“Lopen,” Kaladin said. “You think you can get that bundle of armor\nduring the next bridge run?”\n“Sure,” Lopen said. “Nobody will see. They ignore us Herdies, they\nignore bridgemen, and they especially ignore cripples. To them, I’m so\ninvisible I should be walking through walls.”\nKaladin nodded. “Get it. Hide it. Give it to me right before the final\nplateau assault.”\n“They aren’t going to like you going into a bridge run armored,\ngancho,” Lopen said. “I don’t think this will be any different from what you\ntried before.”\n“We’ll see,” Kaladin said. “Just do it.”\n“The death is my life, the strength becomes my weakness, the journey\nhas ended.”\n—Dated Betabanes, 1173, 95 seconds pre-death. Subject: a scholar of\nsome minor renown. Sample collected secondhand. Considered\nquestionable.\n“That is why, Father,” Adolin said, “you absolutely cannot abdicate to me,\nno matter what we discover with the visions.”\n“Is that so?” Dalinar asked, smiling to himself.\n“Yes.”\n“Very well, you’ve convinced me.”\nAdolin stopped dead in the hallway. The two of them were on their\nway to Dalinar’s chambers. Dalinar turned and looked back at the younger\nman. “Really?” Adolin asked. “I mean, I actually won an argument with\nyou?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “Your points are valid.” He didn’t add that he’d\ncome to the decision on his own. “No matter what, I will stay. I can’t leave\nthis fight now.”\nAdolin smiled broadly.\n“But,” Dalinar said, raising a finger. “I have a requirement. I will draft\nan order—notarized by the highest of my scribes and witnessed by Elhokar\n— that gives you the right to depose me, should I grow too mentally\nunstable. We won’t let the other camps know of it, but I will not risk letting\nmyself grow so crazy that it’s impossible to remove me.”\n“All right,” Adolin said, walking up to Dalinar. They were alone in the\nhallway. “I can accept that. Assuming you don’t tell Sadeas about it. I still\ndon’t trust him.”\n“I’m not asking you to trust him,” Dalinar said pushing the door open\nto his chambers. “You just need to believe that he is capable of changing.\nSadeas was once a friend, and I think he can be again.”\nThe cool stones of the Soulcast chamber seemed to hold the chill of the\nspring weather. It continued to refuse to slip into summer, but at least it\nhadn’t slid into winter either. Elthebar promised that it would not do so—\nbut, then, the stormwarden’s promises were always filled with caveats.

The\nAlmighty’s will was mysterious, and the signs couldn’t always be trusted.\nHe accepted stormwardens now, though when they’d first grown\npopular, he’d rejected their aid. No man should try to know the future, nor\nlay claim to it, for it belonged only to the Almighty himself. And Dalinar\nwondered how stormwardens could do their research without reading. They\nclaimed they didn’t, but he’d seen their books filled with glyphs. Glyphs.\nThey weren’t meant to be used in books; they were pictures. A man who\nhad never seen one before could still understand what one meant, based on\nits shape. That made interpreting glyphs different from reading.\nStormwardens did a lot of things that made people uncomfortable.\nUnfortunately, they were just so useful. Knowing when a highstorm might\nstrike, well, that was just too tempting an advantage. Even though\nstormwardens were frequently wrong, they were more often right.\nRenarin knelt beside the hearth, inspecting the fabrial that had been\ninstalled there to warm the room. Navani had already arrived. She sat at\nDalinar’s elevated writing desk, scribbling a letter; she waved a distracted\ngreeting with her reed as Dalinar entered. She wore the fabrial he had seen\nher displaying at the feast a few weeks back; the multilegged contraption\nwas attached to her shoulder, gripping the cloth of her violet dress.\n“I don’t know, Father,” Adolin said, closing the door. Apparently he\nwas still thinking about Sadeas. “I don’t care if he’s listening to The Way of\nKings. He’s just doing it to make you look less closely at the plateau\nassaults so that his clerks can arrange his cut of the gemhearts more\nfavorably. He’s manipulating you.”\nDalinar shrugged. “Gemhearts are secondary, son. If I can reforge an\nalliance with him, then it’s worth nearly any cost. In a way, I’m the one\nmanipulating him.”\nAdolin sighed. “Very well. But I’m still going to keep a hand on my\nmoney pouch when he’s near.”\n“Just try not to insult him,” Dalinar said. “Oh, and something else. I\nwould like you to take extra care with the King’s Guard. If there are soldiers\nwe know for certain are loyal to me, put those in charge of guarding\nElhokar’s rooms. His words about a conspiracy have me worried.”\n“Surely you don’t give them credence,” Adolin said.\n“Something odd did happen with his armor. This whole mess stinks\nlike cremslime. Perhaps it will turn out to be nothing. For now, humor me.”\n“I have to note,” Navani said, “that I didn’t much care for Sadeas back\nwhen you, he, and Gavilar were friends.” She finished her letter with a\nflourish.\n“He’s not behind the attacks on the king,” Dalinar said.\n“How can you be certain?” Navani asked.\n“Because it’s not his way,” Dalinar said. “Sadeas never wanted the title\nof king.

It wasn’t an accusation.\n“He’s not weak,” Dalinar said, “He’s inexperienced. But yes, that does\nmake the situation ideal for Sadeas. He’s telling the truth—he asked to be\nHighprince of Information because he wants very badly to find out who is\ntrying to kill Elhokar.”\n“Mashala,” Renarin said, using the formal term for aunt. “That fabrial\non your shoulder, what does it do?”\nNavani looked down at the device with a sly smile. Dalinar could see\nshe’d been hoping one of them would ask. Dalinar sat down; the highstorm\nwould be coming soon.\n“Oh, this? It’s a type of painrial. Here, let me show you.” She reached\nup with her safehand, pushing a clip that released the clawlike legs. She\nheld it up. “Do you have any aches, dear? A stubbed toe, perhaps, or a\nscrape?”\nRenarin shook his head.\n“I pulled a muscle in my hand during dueling practice earlier,” Adolin\nsaid. “It’s not bad, but it does ache.”\n“Come over here,” Navani said. Dalinar smiled fondly—Navani was\nalways at her most genuine when playing with new fabrials. It was one of\nthe few times when one got to see her without any pretense. This wasn’t\nNavani the king’s mother or Navani the political schemer. This was Navani\nthe excited engineer.\n“The artifabrian community is doing some amazing things,” Navani\nsaid as Adolin proffered his hand. “I’m particularly proud of this little\ndevice, as I had a hand in its construction.” She clipped it onto Adolin’s\nhand, wrapping the clawlike legs around the palm and locking them into\nplace.\nAdolin raised his hand, turning it around. “The pain is gone.”\n“But you can still feel, correct?” Navani said in a self-satisfied way.\nAdolin prodded his palm with the fingers of his other hand. “The hand\nisn’t numb at all.”\nRenarin watched with keen interest, bespectacled eyes curious, intense.\nIf only the lad could be persuaded to become an ardent. He could be an\nengineer then, if he wanted. And yet he refused. His reasons always seemed\nlike poor excuses to Dalinar.\n“It’s kind of bulky,” Dalinar noted.\n“Well, it’s just an early model,” Navani said defensively. “I was\nworking backward from one of those dreadful creations of Longshadow’s,\nand I didn’t have the luxury of refining the shape. I think it has a lot of\npotential. Imagine a few of these on a battlefield to dull the pain of\nwounded soldiers. Imagine it in the hands of a surgeon, who wouldn’t have\nto worry about his patients’ pain while working on them.”\nAdolin nodded.

Either way, it’s a\ncompletely different type from paired fabrials like the spanreeds. If you\ncould see the plans we have for the future…”\n“Like what?” Adolin asked.\n“You’ll find out eventually,” Navani said, smiling mysteriously. She\nremoved the fabrial from Adolin’s hand.\n“Shardblades?” Adolin sounded excited.\n“Well, no,” Navani said. “The design and workings of Shardblades and\nPlate are completely different from everything we’ve discovered. The\nclosest anyone has are those shields in Jah Keved. But as far as I can tell,\nthey use a completely different design principle from regular Shardplate.\nThe ancients must have had a wondrous grasp of engineering.”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “I’ve seen them, Navani. They’re… well, they’re\nancient. Their technology is primitive.”\n“And the Dawncities?” Navani asked skeptically. “The fabrials?”\nDalinar shook his head. “I’ve seen neither. There are Shardblades in\nthe visions, but they seem so out of place. Perhaps they were given directly\nby the Heralds, as the legends say.”\n“Perhaps,” Navani said. “Why don’t—”\nShe vanished.\nDalinar blinked. He hadn’t heard the highstorm approaching.\nHe was now in a large, open room with pillars running along the sides.\nThe enormous pillars looked sculpted of soft sandstone, with\nunornamented, granular sides. The ceiling was far above, carved from the\nrock in geometric patterns that looked faintly familiar. Circles connected by\nlines, spreading outward from one another…\n“I don’t know what to do, old friend,” a voice said from the side.\nDalinar turned to see a youthful man in regal white and gold robes, walking\nwith his hands clasped before him, hidden by voluminous sleeves. He had\ndark hair pulled back in a braid and a short beard that came to a point. Gold\nthreads were woven into his hair and came together on his forehead to form\na golden symbol. The symbol of the Knights Radiant.\n“They say that each time it is the same,” the man said. “We are never\nready for the Desolations. We should be getting better at resisting, but each\ntime we step closer to destruction instead.” He turned to Dalinar, as if\nexpecting a response.\nDalinar glanced down. He too wore ornamental robes, though not as\nlavish. Where was he? What time? He needed to find clues for Navani to\nrecord and for Jasnah to use in proving—or disproving—these dreams.\n“I don’t know what to say either,” Dalinar responded. If he wanted\ninformation, he needed to act more natural than he had in previous visions.\nThe regal man sighed. “I had hoped you would have wisdom to share\nwith me, Karm.” They continued walking toward the side of the room,"

It looked out upon an evening sky; the setting sun stained the\nair a dirty, sultry red.\n“Our own natures destroy us,” the regal man said, voice soft, though\nhis face was angry. “Alakavish was a Surgebinder. He should have known\nbetter. And yet, the Nahel bond gave him no more wisdom than a regular\nman. Alas, not all spren are as discerning as honorspren.”\n“I agree,” Dalinar said.\nThe other man looked relieved. “I worried that you would find my\nclaims too forward. Your own Surgebinders were… But, no, we should not\nlook backward.”\nWhat’s a Surgebinder? Dalinar wanted to scream the question out, but\nthere was no way. Not without sounding completely out of place.\nPerhaps…\n“What do you think should be done with these Surgebinders?” Dalinar\nasked carefully.\n“I don’t know if we can force them to do anything.” Their footsteps\nechoed in the empty room. Were there no guards, no attendants? “Their\npower… well, Alakavish proves the allure that Surgebinders have for the\ncommon people. If only there were a way to encourage them….” The man\nstopped, turning to Dalinar. “They need to be better, old friend. We all do.\nThe responsibility of what we’ve been given—whether it be the crown or\nthe Nahel bond—needs to make us better.”\nHe seemed to expect something from Dalinar. But what?\n“I can read your disagreement in your face,” the regal man said. “It’s\nall right, Karm. I realize that my thoughts on this subject are\nunconventional. Perhaps the rest of you are right, perhaps our abilities are\nproof of a divine election. But if this is true, should we not be more wary of\nhow we act?”\nDalinar frowned. That sounded familiar to him. The regal man sighed,\nwalking to the balcony lip. Dalinar joined him, stepping outside. The\nperspective finally allowed him to look down on the landscape below.\nThousands of corpses confronted him.\nDalinar gasped. Dead filled the streets of the city outside, a city that\nDalinar vaguely recognized. Kholinar, he thought. My homeland. He stood\nwith the regal man at the top of a low tower, three stories high—a keep of\nsome sort, constructed of stone. It seemed to sit where the palace would\nsomeday be.\nThe city was unmistakable, with its peaked stone formations rising like\nenormous fins into the air. The windblades, they were called. But they were\nless weathered than he was accustomed to, and the city around them was\nvery different. Built of blocky stone structures, many of which had been\nknocked down. The destruction spread far, lining the sides of primitive\nstreets. Had the city been hit by an earthquake?\nNo, those corpses had fallen in battle.

        "text": "streets. Had the city been hit by an earthquake?\nNo, those corpses had fallen in battle. Dalinar could smell the stench\nof blood, viscera, smoke. The bodies lay strewn about, many near the low\nwall that surrounded the keep. The wall was broken in places, smashed.\nAnd there were rocks of strange shape mixed about the corpses. Stones cut\nlike…\nBlood of my fathers, Dalinar thought, gripping the stone railing,\nleading forward. Those aren’t stones. They’re creatures. Massive creatures,\neasily five or six times the size of a person, their skin dull and grey like\ngranite. They had long limbs and skeletal bodies, the forelegs—or were\nthey arms?—set into wide shoulders. The faces were lean, narrow.\nArrowlike.\n“What happened here?” Dalinar asked despite himself. “It’s terrible!”\n“I ask myself this same thing. How could we let this occur? The\nDesolations are well named. I’ve heard initial counts. Eleven years of war,\nand nine out of ten people I once ruled are dead. Do we even have\nkingdoms to lead any longer? Sur is gone, I’m sure of it. Tarma, Eiliz, they\nwon’t likely survive. Too many of their people have fallen.”\nDalinar had never heard of those places.\nThe man made a fist, pounding it softly against the railing. Burning\nstations had been set up in the distance; they had begun cremating the\ncorpses. “The others want to blame Alakavish. And true, if he hadn’t\nbrought us to war before the Desolation, we might not have been broken\nthis badly. But Alakavish was a symptom of a greater disease. When the\nHeralds next return, what will they find? A people who have forgotten them\nyet again? A world torn by war and squabbling? If we continue as we have,\nthen perhaps we deserve to lose.”\nDalinar felt a chill. He had thought that this vision must come after his\nprevious one, but prior visions hadn’t been chronological. He hadn’t seen\nany Knights Radiant yet, but that might not be because they had disbanded.\nPerhaps they didn’t exist yet. And perhaps there was a reason this man’s\nwords sounded so familiar.\nCould it be? Could he really be standing beside the very man whose\nwords Dalinar had listened to time and time again? “There is honor in loss,”\nDalinar said carefully, using words repeated several times in The Way of\nKings.\n“If that loss brings learning.” The man smiled. “Using my own sayings\nagainst me again, Karm?”\nDalinar felt himself grow short of breath. The man himself. Nohadon.\nThe great king. He was real. Or he had been real. This man was younger\nthan Dalinar had imagined him, but that humble, yet regal bearing… yes, it\nwas right.\n“I’m thinking of giving up my throne,” Nohadon said softly.\n“No!” Dalinar stepped toward him. “You mustn’t.”\n“I cannot lead them,” the man said. “Not if this is what my leadership\nbrings them to.”\n“Nohadon.”\nThe man turned to him, frowning. “What?”\nDalinar paused. Could he be wrong about this man’s identity? But no."

Many famous people in history had\nbeen given holy names by the Church, before it was disbanded. Even\nBajerden wasn’t likely to be his real name; that was lost in time.\n“It is nothing,” Dalinar said. “You cannot give up your throne. The\npeople need a leader.”\n“They have leaders,” Nohadon said. “There are princes, kings,\nSoulcasters, Surgebinders. We never lack men and women who wish to\nlead.”\n“True,” Dalinar said, “but we do lack ones who are good at it.”\nNohadon leaned over the railing. He stared at the fallen, an expression\nof deep grief—and trouble—on his face. It was so strange to see the man\nlike this. He was so young. Dalinar had never imagined such insecurity,\nsuch torment, in him.\n“I know that feeling,” Dalinar said softly. “The uncertainty, the shame,\nthe confusion.”\n“You can read me too well, old friend.”\n“I know those emotions because I’ve felt them. I… I never assumed\nthat you would feel them too.”\n“Then I correct myself. Perhaps you don’t know me well enough.”\nDalinar fell silent.\n“So what do I do?” Nohadon asked.\n“You’re asking me?”\n“You’re my advisor, aren’t you? Well, I should like some advice.”\n“I… You can’t give up your throne.”\n“And what should I do with it?” Nohadon turned and walked along the\nlong balcony. It seemed to run around this entire level. Dalinar joined him,\npassing places where the stone was ripped, the railing broken away.\n“I haven’t faith in people any longer, old friend,” Nohadon said. “Put\ntwo men together, and they will find something to argue about. Gather them\ninto groups, and one group will find reason to oppress or attack another.\nNow this. How do I protect them? How do I stop this from happening\nagain?”\n“You dictate a book,” Dalinar said eagerly. “A grand book to give\npeople hope, to explain your philosophy on leadership and how lives should\nbe lived!”\n“A book? Me. Write a book?”\n“Why not?”\n“Because it’s a fantastically stupid idea.”\nDalinar’s jaw dropped.\n“The world as we know it has quite nearly been destroyed,” Nohadon\nsaid. “Barely a family exists that hasn’t lost half its members! Our best men\nare corpses on that field, and we haven’t food to last more than two or three\nmonths at best. And I’m to spend my time writing a book? Who would\nscribe it for me? All of my wordsmen were slaughtered when Yelignar\nbroke into the chancery. You’re the only man of letters I know of who’s still\nalive.”\nA man of letters? This was an odd time. “I could write it, then.”\n“With one arm? Have you learned to write left-handed, then?”\nDalinar looked down. He had both of his arms, though apparently the\nman Nohadon saw was missing his right."

He had both of his arms, though apparently the\nman Nohadon saw was missing his right.\n“No, we need to rebuild,” Nohadon said. “I just wish there were a way\nto convince the kings—the ones still alive—not to seek advantage over one\nanother.” Nohadon tapped the balcony. “So this is my decision. Step down,\nor do what is needed. This isn’t a time for writing. It’s a time for action.\nAnd then, unfortunately, a time for the sword.”\nThe sword? Dalinar thought. From you, Nohadon?\nIt wouldn’t happen. This man would become a great philosopher; he\nwould teach peace and reverence for others, and would not force men to do\nas he wished. He would guide them to acting with honor.\nNohadon turned to Dalinar. “I apologize, Karm. I should not dismiss\nyour suggestions right after asking for them. I’m on edge, as I imagine that\nwe all are. At times, it seems to me that to be human is to want that which\nwe cannot have. For some, this is power. For me, it is peace.”\nNohadon turned, walking back down the balcony. Though his pace was\nslow, his posture indicated that he wished to be alone. Dalinar let him go.\n“He goes on to become one of the most influential writers Roshar has\never known,” Dalinar said.\nThere was silence, save for the calls of the people working below,\ngathering the corpses.\n“I know you’re there,” Dalinar said.\nSilence.\n“What does he decide?” Dalinar asked. “Did he unite them, as he\nwanted?”\nThe voice that often spoke in his visions did not come. Dalinar\nreceived no answer to his questions. He sighed, turning to look out over the\nfields of dead.\n“You are right about one thing, at least, Nohadon. To be human is to\nwant that which we cannot have.”\nThe landscape darkened, the sun setting. That darkness enveloped him,\nand he closed his eyes. When he opened them, he was back in his rooms,\nstanding with his hands on the back of a chair. He turned to Adolin and\nRenarin, who stood nearby, anxious, prepared to grab him if he got violent.\n“Well,” Dalinar said, “that was meaningless. I learned nothing. Blast!\nI’m doing a poor job of—”\n“Dalinar,” Navani said curtly, still scribbling with a reed at her paper.\n“The last thing you said before the vision ended. What was it?”\nDalinar frowned. “The last…”\n“Yes,” Navani said, urgent. “The very last words you spoke.”\n“I was quoting the man I’d been speaking with. ‘To be human is to\nwant that which we cannot have.’ Why?”\nShe ignored him, writing furiously. Once done, she slid off the high-\nlegged chair, hurrying to his bookshelf. “Do you have a copy of… Yes, I\nthought you might. These are Jasnah’s books, aren’t they?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “She wanted them cared for until she returned.”\nNavani pulled a volume off the shelf. “Corvana’s Analectics.” She set"

She looked up at Dalinar. “When you go into\nthese visions of yours, you know that you speak.”\n“Gibberish. Yes, my sons have told me.”\n“Anak malah kaf, del makian habin yah,” Navani said. “Sound\nfamiliar?”\nDalinar shook his head, baffled.\n“It sounds a lot like what father was saying,” Renarin said. “When he\nwas in the vision.”\n“Not ‘a lot like’ Renarin,” Navani said, looking smug. “It’s exactly the\nsame phrase. That is the last thing you said before coming out of your\ntrance. I wrote down everything—as best I could—that you babbled today.”\n“For what purpose?” Dalinar asked.\n“Because,” Navani said “I thought it might be helpful. And it was. The\nsame phrase is in the Analectics, almost exactly.”\n“What?” Dalinar asked, incredulous. “How?”\n“It’s a line from a song,” Navani said. “A chant by the Vanrial, an\norder of artists who live on the slopes of the Silent Mount in Jah Keved.\nYear after year, century after century, they’ve sung these same words—\nsongs they claim were written in the Dawnchant by the Heralds themselves.\nThey have the words of those songs, written in an ancient script. But the\nmeanings have been lost. They’re just sounds, now. Some scholars believe\nthat the script—and the songs themselves—may indeed be in the\nDawnchant.”\n“And I…” Dalinar said.\n“You just spoke a line from one of them,” Navani said. “Beyond that,\nif the phrase you just gave me is correct, you translated it. This could prove\nthe Vanrial Hypothesis! One sentence isn’t much, but it could give us the\nkey to translating the entire script. It has been itching at me for a while,\nlistening to these visions. I thought the things you were saying had too\nmuch order to be gibberish.” She looked at Dalinar, smiling deeply.\n“Dalinar, you might just have cracked one of the most perplexing—and\nancient— mysteries of all time.”\n“Wait,” Adolin said. “What are you saying?”\n“What I’m saying, nephew,” Navani said, looking directly at him, “is\nthat we have your proof.”\n“But,” Adolin said. “I mean, he could have heard that one phrase…”\n“And extrapolated an entire language from it?” Navani said, holding\nup a sheet full of writings. “This is not gibberish, but it’s no language that\npeople now speak. I suspect it is what it seems, the Dawnchant. So unless\nyou can think of another way your father learned to speak a dead language,\nAdolin, the visions are most certainly real.”\nThe room fell silent. Navani herself looked stunned by what she had\nsaid. She shook it off quickly. “Now, Dalinar,” she said, “I want you to"

She shook it off quickly. “Now, Dalinar,” she said, “I want you to\ndescribe this vision as accurately as possible. I need the exact words you\nspoke, if you can recall them. Every bit we gather will help my scholars sort\nthrough this….”\n“In the storm I awaken, falling, spinning, grieving.”\n—Dated Kakanev, 1173, 13 seconds pre-death. Subject was a city\nguardsman.\n“How can you be so sure it was him, Dalinar?” Navani asked softly.\nDalinar shook his head. “I just am. That was Nohadon.”\nIt had been several hours since the end of the vision. Navani had left\nher writing table to sit in a more comfortable chair near Dalinar. Renarin sat\nacross from him, accompanying them for propriety’s sake. Adolin had left\nto get the highstorm damage report. The lad had seemed very disturbed by\nthe discovery that the visions were real.\n“But the man you saw never spoke his name,” Navani said.\n“It was him, Navani.” Dalinar stared toward the wall over Renarin’s\nhead, looking at the smooth brown Soulcast rock. “There was an aura of\ncommand about him, the weight of great responsibilities. A regality.”\n“It could have been some other king,” she said. “After all, he discarded\nyour suggestion that he write a book.”\n“It just wasn’t the time for him to write it yet. So much death… He\nwas cast down by some great loss. Stormfather! Nine out of ten people dead\nin war. Can you imagine such a thing?”\n“The Desolations,” Navani said.\nUnite the people…. The True Desolation comes….\n“Do you know of any references to the Desolations?” Dalinar asked.\n“Not the tales ardents tell. Historical references?”\nNavani held a cup of warmed violet wine in her hand, beads of\ncondensation on the rim of the glass. “Yes, but I am the wrong one to ask.\nJasnah is the historian.”\n“I think I saw the aftermath of one. I… I may have seen corpses of\nVoidbringers. Could that give us more proof?”\n“Nothing nearly as good as the linguistics.” Navani took a sip of her\nwine. “The Desolations are matters of ancient lore. It could be argued that\nyou imagined what you expected to see. But those words—if we can\ntranslate them, nobody will be able to dispute that you are seeing something\nreal.” Her writing board lay on the low table between them, reed and ink set\ncarefully across the paper.\n“You intend to tell others?” Dalinar asked. “Of my visions?”\n“How else will we explain what is happening to you?”\nDalinar hesitated. How could he explain? On one hand, it was\nrelieving to know that he was not mad. But what if some force were trying\nto mislead him with these visions, using images of Nohadon and the\nRadiants because he would find them trustworthy?\nThe Knights Radiant fell, Dalinar reminded himself.

        "text": "The Knights Radiant fell, Dalinar reminded himself. They abandoned\nus. Some of the other orders may have turned against us, as the legends say.\nThere was an unsettling edge to all of that. He had another stone in\nrebuilding the foundation of who he was, but the most important point still\nremained undecided. Did he trust his visions or not? He couldn’t go back to\nbelieving them unquestioningly, not now that Adolin’s challenges had\nraised real worries in his head.\nUntil he knew their source, he felt he shouldn’t spread knowledge of\nthem.\n“Dalinar,” Navani said, leaning forward. “The warcamps speak of your\nepisodes. Even the wives of your officers are uncomfortable. They think\nyou fear the storms, or that you have some disease of the mind. This will\nvindicate you.”\n“How? By making me into some kind of mystic? Many will think that\nthe breeze of these visions blows too close to prophecy.”\n“You see the past, Father,” Renarin said. “That is not forbidden. And if\nthe Almighty sends them, then how could men question?”\n“Adolin and I both spoke with ardents,” Dalinar replied. “They said it\nwas very unlikely that this would come from the Almighty. If we do decide\nthe visions are to be trusted, many will disagree with me.”\nNavani settled back, sipping her wine, safehand lying across her lap.\n“Dalinar, your sons told me that you once sought the Old Magic. Why?\nWhat did you ask of the Nightwatcher, and what curse did she give you in\nreturn?”\n“I told them that shame is my own,” Dalinar said. “And I will not\nshare it.”\nThe room fell silent. The flurries of rain following the highstorm had\nceased falling on the roof. “It might be important,” Navani finally said.\n“It was long ago. Long before the visions began. I don’t think it’s\nrelated.”\n“But it could be.”\n“Yes,” he admitted. Would that day never stop haunting him? Was not\nlosing all memory of his wife enough?\nWhat did Renarin think? Would he condemn his father for such an\negregious sin? Dalinar forced himself to look up and meet his son’s\nbespectacled eyes.\nCuriously, Renarin didn’t seem bothered. Just thoughtful.\n“I’m sorry you had to discover my shame,” Dalinar said, looking to\nNavani.\nShe waved indifferently. “Soliciting the Old Magic is offensive to the\ndevotaries, but their punishments for the act are never severe. I assume that\nyou didn’t have to do much to be cleansed.”\n“The ardents asked for spheres to give the poor,” Dalinar said. “And I\nhad to commission a series of prayers. None of that removed the effects or\nmy sense of guilt.”\n“I think you’d be surprised at how many devout lighteyes turn to the\nOld Magic at one point in their lives or another. The ones who can make\ntheir way to the Valley, at least. But I do wonder if this is related.”\n“Aunt,” Renarin said, turning to her. “I have recently asked for a\nnumber of readings about the Old Magic. I agree with his assessment. This\ndoes not feel like the work of the Nightwatcher. She gives curses in\nexchange for granting small desires. Always one curse and one desire."

Always one curse and one desire.\nFather, I assume you know what both of those things are?”\n“Yes,” he said. “I know exactly what my curse was, and it does not\nrelate to this.”\n“Then it is unlikely that the Old Magic is to blame.”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. “But your aunt is right to question. The truth is,\nwe don’t have any proof that this came from the Almighty either.\nSomething wants me to know of the Desolations and the Knights Radiant.\nPerhaps we should start asking ourselves why that is.”\n“What were the Desolations, Aunt?” Renarin asked. “The ardents talk\nof the Voidbringers. Of mankind, and the Radiants, and of fighting. But\nwhat were they really? Do we know anything specific?”\n“There are folklorists among your father’s clerks who would serve you\nbetter in this matter.”\n“Perhaps,” Dalinar added, “but I’m not sure which of them I can trust.”\nNavani paused. “Fair enough. Well, from what I understand, there are\nno primary accounts remaining. This was long, long ago. I do recall that the\nmyth of Parasaphi and Nadris mentions the Desolations.”\n“Parasaphi,” Renarin said. “She’s the one who searched out the\nseedstones.”\n“Yes,” Navani replied. “In order to repopulate her fallen people, she\nclimbed the peaks of Dara—the myth changes, listing different modern\nmountain ranges as the true peaks of Dara—to find stones touched by the\nHeralds themselves. She brought them to Nadris on his deathbed and\nharvested his seed to bring life to the stones. They hatched forth ten\nchildren, which she used to found a new nation. Marnah, I believe it was\ncalled.”\n“Origin of the Makabaki,” Renarin said. “Mother told me that story\nwhen I was a child.”\nDalinar shook his head. “Born from rocks?” The old stories rarely\nmade much sense to him, although the devotaries had canonized many of\nthem.\n“The story mentions the Desolations at the beginning,” Navani said.\n“Giving them credit for having wiped out Parasaphi’s people.”\n“But what were they?”\n“Wars.” Navani took a sip of wine. “The Voidbringers came again and\nagain, trying to force mankind off Roshar and into Damnation. Just as they\nonce forced mankind—and the Heralds—out of the Tranquiline Halls.”\n“When were the Knights Radiant founded?” Dalinar asked.\nNavani shrugged. “I don’t know. Perhaps they were some military\ngroup from a specific kingdom, or perhaps they were originally a mercenary\nband. That would make it easy to see how they could eventually become\ntyrants.”\n“My visions don’t imply that they were tyrants,” he said. “Perhaps that\nis the true purpose of the visions. To make me believe lies about the\nRadiants. Making me trust them, perhaps trying to lead me to mimic their\ndownfall and betrayal.”\n“I don’t know,” Navani said, sounding skeptical. “I don’t think you’ve"

The legends tend to agree that the\nRadiants weren’t always so bad. As much as the legends agree on anything,\nat least.”\nDalinar stood and took her nearly empty cup, then walked over to the\nserving table and refilled it. Discovering that he was not mad should have\nhelped clear things up, but instead left him more disturbed. What if the\nVoidbringers were behind the visions? Some stories he heard said that they\ncould possess the bodies of men and make them do evil. Or, if they were\nfrom the Almighty, what was their purpose?\n“I need to think on all of this,” he said. “It has been a long day. Please,\nif I could be left to my own thoughts now.”\nRenarin rose and bowed his head in respect before heading to the door.\nNavani rose more slowly, sleek dress rustling as she set her cup on the\ntable, then walked over to fetch her pain-drinking fabrial. Renarin left, and\nDalinar walked to the doorway, waiting as Navani approached. He didn’t\nintend to let her trap him alone again. He looked out the doorway. His\nsoldiers were there, and he could see them. Good.\n“Aren’t you pleased at all?” Navani asked, lingering beside the\ndoorway near him, one hand on the frame.\n“Pleased?”\n“You aren’t going mad.”\n“And we don’t know if I’m being manipulated or not,” he said. “In a\nway, we have more questions now than we had before.”\n“The visions are a blessing,” Navani said, laying her freehand on his\narm. “I feel it, Dalinar. Don’t you see how wonderful this is?”\nDalinar met her eyes, light violet, beautiful. She was so thoughtful, so\nclever. How he wished he could trust her completely.\nShe has shown me nothing but honor, he thought. Never speaking a\nword to anyone else of my intention to abdicate. She hasn’t so much as tried\nto use my visions against me. He felt ashamed that he’d once worried that\nshe might.\nShe was a wonderful woman, Navani Kholin. A wonderful, amazing,\ndangerous woman.\n“I see more worries,” he said. “And more danger.”\n“But Dalinar, you’re having experiences scholars, historians, and\nfolklorists could only dream about! I envy you, although you claim to have\nseen no fabrials of note.”\n“The ancients didn’t have fabrials, Navani. I’m certain of it.”\n“And that changes everything we thought we understood about them.”\n“I suppose.”\n“Stonefalls, Dalinar,” she said, sighing. “Does nothing bring you to\npassion any longer?”\nDalinar took a deep breath. “Too many things, Navani. My insides feel\nlike a mass of eels, emotions squirming over one another. The truth of these\nvisions is unsettling.”\n“It’s exciting,” she corrected. “Did you mean what you said earlier?\nAbout trusting me?”\n“I said that?”\n“You said you didn’t trust your clerks, and you asked me to record the"

My brother…” He reached for the door to open it\nagain.\n“Your brother,” Navani spat, expression flashing with anger. “Why\nmust everyone always focus on him? Everyone always worries so much\nabout the man who died! He’s not here, Dalinar. He’s gone. I miss him. But\nnot half as much as you do, it appears.”\n“I honor his memory,” Dalinar said stiffly, hesitating, hand on the\ndoor’s latch.\n“That’s fine! I’m happy you do. But it’s been six years, and all anyone\ncan see me as is the wife of a dead man. The other women, they humor me\nwith idle gossip, but they won’t let me into their political circles. They think\nI’m a relic. You wanted to know why I came back so quickly?”\n“I—”\n“I returned,” she said, “because I have no home. I’m expected to sit\nout of important events because my husband is dead! Lounge around,\npampered but ignored. I make them uncomfortable. The queen, the other\nwomen at court.”\n“I’m sorry,” Dalinar said. “But I don’t—”\nShe raised her freehand, tapping him on the chest. “I won’t take it from\nyou, Dalinar. We were friends before I even met Gavilar! You still know me\nas me, not some shadow of a dynasty that crumbled years ago. Don’t you?”\nShe looked at him, pleading.\nBlood of my fathers, Dalinar thought with shock. She’s crying. Two\nsmall tears.\nHe had rarely seen her so sincere.\nAnd so he kissed her.\nIt was a mistake. He knew it was. He grabbed her anyway, pulling her\ninto a rough, tight embrace and pressing his mouth to hers, unable to\ncontain himself. She melted against him. He tasted the salt of her tears as\nthey ran down to her lips and met his.\nIt lasted long. Too long. Wonderfully long. His mind screamed at him,\nlike a prisoner chained in a cell and forced to watch something horrible. But\na part of him had wanted this for decades—decades spent watching his\nbrother court, marry, and then hold the only woman that the young Dalinar\nhad ever wanted.\nHe’d told himself he would never allow this. He had denied himself\nfeelings for Navani the moment Gavilar had won her hand. Dalinar had\nstepped aside.\nBut the taste of her—the smell of her, the warmth of her pressed"

Like a blossoming perfume, it washed away\nthe guilt. For a moment, that touch banished everything. He couldn’t\nremember his fear at the visions, his worry about Sadeas, his shame at past\nmistakes.\nHe could only think of her. Beautiful, insightful, delicate yet strong at\nonce. He clung to her, something he could hold onto as the rest of the world\nchurned around him.\nEventually, he broke the kiss. She looked up at him, dazed. Passion-\nspren, like tiny flakes of crystalline snow, floated down in the air around\nthem. Guilt flooded him again. He tried gently to push her away, but she\nclung to him, holding on tight.\n“Navani,” he said.\n“Hush.” She pressed her head against his chest.\n“We can’t—”\n“Hush,” she said, more insistently.\nHe sighed, but let himself hold her.\n“Something is going wrong in this world, Dalinar,” Navani said softly.\n“The king of Jah Keved was assassinated. I heard it just today. He was\nkilled by a Shin Shardbearer in white clothing.”\n“Stormfather!” Dalinar said.\n“Something’s going on,” she said. “Something bigger than our war\nhere, something bigger than Gavilar. Have you heard of the twisted things\nmen say when they die? Most ignore it, but surgeons are talking. And\nstormwardens whisper that the highstorms are growing more powerful.”\n“I have heard,” he said, finding it difficult to get the words out,\nintoxicated by her as he was.\n“My daughter seeks something,” Navani said. “She frightens me\nsometimes. She’s so intense. I honestly believe she’s the most intelligent\nperson I’ve ever known. And the things she searches for… Dalinar, she\nbelieves that something very dangerous is near.”\nThe sun approaches the horizon. The Everstorm comes. The True\nDesolation. The Night of Sorrows….\n“I need you,” Navani said. “I’ve known it for years, though I feared it\nwould destroy you with guilt, so I fled. But I couldn’t stay away. Not with\nthe way they treat me. Not with what is happening to the world. I’m\nterrified, Dalinar, and I need you. Gavilar was not the man everyone thought\nhim to be. I was fond of him, but he—”\n“Please,” Dalinar said, “don’t speak ill of him.”\n“Very well.”\nBlood of my fathers! He couldn’t get her scent out of his head. He felt\nparalyzed, holding to her like a man clinging to a stone in the stormwinds.\nShe looked up at him. “Well, let it be said—then—that I was fond of\nGavilar. But I’m more than fond of you. And I’m tired of waiting.”\nHe closed his eyes. “How can this work?”\n“We’ll find a way.”\n“We’ll be denounced.”\n“The warcamps already ignore me,” Navani said, “and they spread\nrumors and lies about you. What more can they do to us?”"

What more can they do to us?”\n“They’ll find something. As of yet, the devotaries do not condemn\nme.”\n“Gavilar is dead,” Navani said, resting her head back against his chest.\n“I was never unfaithful while he lived, though the Stormfather knows I had\nample reason. The devotaries can say what they wish, but The Arguments do\nnot forbid our union. Tradition is not the same as doctrine, and I will not\nhold myself back for fear of offending.”\nDalinar took a deep breath, then forced himself to open his arms and\npull back. “If you had hoped to soothe my worries for the day, then this\ndidn’t help.”\nShe folded her arms. He could still feel where her safehand had\ntouched him on the back. A tender touch, reserved for a family member.\n“I’m not here to soothe you, Dalinar. Quite the opposite.”\n“Please. I do need time to think.”\n“I won’t let you put me away. I won’t ignore that this happened. I\nwon’t—”\n“Navani,” he gently cut her off, “I will not abandon you. I promise.”\nShe eyed him, then a wry smile crept onto her face. “Very well. But\nyou began something today.”\n“I began it?” he asked, amused, elated, confused, worried, and\nashamed at the same time.\n“The kiss was yours, Dalinar,” she said idly, pulling open the door and\nentering his antechamber.\n“You seduced me to it.”\n“What? Seduced?” She glanced back at him. “Dalinar, I’ve never been\nmore open and honest in my life.”\n“I know,” Dalinar said, smiling. “That was the seductive part.” He\nclosed the door softly, then let out a sigh.\nBlood of my fathers, he thought, why can’t these things ever be simple?\nAnd yet, in direct contrast with his thoughts, he felt as if the entire\nworld had somehow become more right for having gone wrong.\n“The darkness becomes a palace. Let it rule! Let it rule!”\n—Kakevah 1173, 22 seconds pre-death. A darkeyed Selay man of\nunknown profession.\n“You think one of those will save us?” Moash asked, scowling as he looked\nat the prayer tied about Kaladin’s upper right arm.\nKaladin glanced to the side. He stood at parade rest as Sadeas’s\nsoldiers crossed their bridge. The chilly spring air felt good, now that he’d\nstarted working. The sky was bright, cloudless, and the stormwardens\npromised that no highstorm was near.\nThe prayer tied on his arms was simple. Three glyphs: wind,\nprotection, beloved. A prayer to Jezerezeh—the Stormfather—to protect\nloved ones and friends. It was the straightforward type his mother had\npreferred. For all her subtlety and wryness, whenever she’d knitted or\nwritten a prayer, it had been simple and heartfelt. Wearing it reminded him\nof her.\n“I can’t believe you paid good money for that,” Moash said. “If there"

Wearing it reminded him\nof her.\n“I can’t believe you paid good money for that,” Moash said. “If there\nare Heralds watching, they don’t pay any mind to bridgemen.”\n“I’ve been feeling nostalgic lately, I guess.” The prayer was probably\nmeaningless, but he’d had reason to start thinking more about religion\nlately. The life of a slave made it difficult for many to believe that anyone,\nor anything, was watching. Yet many bridgemen had grown more religious\nduring their captivity. Two groups, opposite reactions. Did that mean some\nwere stupid and others were callous, or something else entirely?\n“They’re going to see us dead, you know,” Drehy said from behind.\n“This is it.” The bridgemen were exhausted. Kaladin and his team had been\nforced to work the chasms all night. Hashal had put strict requirements on\nthem, demanding an increased amount of salvage. In order to meet the\nquota, they’d forgone training to scavenge.\nAnd then today they’d been awakened for a morning chasm assault\nafter only three hours of sleep. They were drooping as they stood in line,\nand they hadn’t even reached the contested plateau yet.\n“Let it come,” Skar said quietly from the other side of the line. “They\nwant us dead? Well, I’m not going to back down. We’ll show them what\ncourage is. They can hide behind our bridges while we charge.”\n“That’s no victory,” Moash said. “I say we attack the soldiers. Right\nnow.”\n“Our own troops?” Sigzil said, turning his dark-skinned head and\nlooking down the line of men.\n“Sure,” Moash said, eyes still forward. “They’re going to kill us\nanyway. Let’s take a few of them with us. Damnation, why not charge\nSadeas? His guard won’t expect it. I’ll bet we could knock down a few and\ngrab their spears, then be on to killing lighteyes before they cut us down.”\nA couple of bridgemen murmured their assent as the soldiers continued\nto cross.\n“No,” Kaladin said. “It wouldn’t accomplish anything. They’d have us\ndead before we could so much as inconvenience Sadeas.”\nMoash spat. “And this will accomplish something? Damnation,\nKaladin, I feel like I’m already dangling from the noose!”\n“I have a plan,” Kaladin said.\nHe waited for the objections. His other plans hadn’t worked.\nNo one offered a complaint.\n“Well then,” Moash said. “What is it?”\n“You’ll see today,” Kaladin said. “If it works, it will buy us time. If it\nfails, I’ll be dead.” He turned to look down the line of faces. “In that case,\nTeft has orders to lead you on an escape attempt tonight. You’re not ready,\nbut at least you’ll have a chance.” That was far better than attacking Sadeas\nas he crossed.\nKaladin’s men nodded, and Moash seemed content.

        "text": "he’d been originally, he had grown equally loyal. He was hotheaded, but he\nwas also the best with the spear.\nSadeas approached, riding his roan stallion, wearing his red\nShardplate, helm on but visor up. By chance, he crossed on Kaladin’s\nbridge, though—as always—he had twenty to choose from. Sadeas didn’t\ngive Bridge Four so much as a glance.\n“Break and cross,” Kaladin ordered after Sadeas was over. The\nbridgemen crossed their bridge, and Kaladin gave the orders for them to\npull it behind them, then lift.\nIt felt heavier than it ever had before. The bridgemen broke into a trot,\nrounding the army column and hustling to reach the next chasm. In the\ndistance behind, a second army—one in blue—was following them,\ncrossing using some of Sadeas’s other bridge crews. It looked like Dalinar\nKholin had given up his bulky mechanical bridges, and was now using\nSadeas’s own bridge crews to cross. So much for his “honor” and not\nsacrificing bridgeman lives.\nIn his pouch, Kaladin carried a large number of infused spheres,\nobtained from the moneychangers in exchange for a greater quantity of dun\nspheres. He hated taking that loss, but he needed the Stormlight.\nThey reached the next chasm quickly. It would be the next-to-last one,\naccording to the word he’d gotten from Matal, Hashal’s husband. The\nsoldiers began checking their armor, stretching, anticipationspren rising in\nthe air like small streamers.\nThe bridgemen set their bridge and stepped back. Kaladin noted Lopen\nand silent Dabbid approaching with their stretcher, waterskins and bandages\ninside. Lopen had hitched the stretcher to a hook at his waist, making up for\nhis missing arm. The two moved among the members of Bridge Four,\ngiving them water.\nAs he passed Kaladin, Lopen nodded toward the large bulge at the\nstretcher’s center. The armor. “When do you want it?” Lopen asked softly,\nlowering the litter, then handing Kaladin a waterskin.\n“Right before we run the assault,” Kaladin replied. “You did well,\nLopen.”\nLopen winked. “A one-armed Herdazian is still twice as useful as a no-\nbrained Alethi. Plus, so long as I’ve got one hand, I can still do this.” He\ncovertly made a rude gesture toward the marching soldiers.\nKaladin smiled, but was growing too nervous to feel mirth. It had been\na long time since he’d gotten jitters going into a battle. He thought Tukks\nhad beaten that out of him years ago.\n“Hey,” a sudden voice called, “I need some of that.”\nKaladin spun to see a soldier walking over. He was exactly the type of\nman Kaladin had known to avoid back in Amaram’s army. Darkeyed but of\nmodest rank, he was naturally large, and had probably gotten promoted by\nsheer virtue of size. His armor was well maintained but the uniform beneath\nwas stained and wrinkled, and he kept the sleeves rolled up, exposing hairy\narms.\nAt first, Kaladin assumed that the man had seen Lopen’s gesture.

He shoved Kaladin aside, then pulled the\nwaterskin away from Lopen. Nearby, the soldiers waiting to cross had\nnoticed. Their own water crews were much slower, and more than a few of\nthe waiting men eyed Lopen and his waterskins.\nIt would set a terrible precedent to let the soldiers take their water—\nbut that was a tiny problem compared with the greater one. If those soldiers\nswarmed around the litter to get water, they’d discover the sack full of\narmor.\nKaladin moved quickly, snatching the waterskin from the soldier’s\nhand. “You have your own water crews.”\nThe soldier looked at Kaladin, as if completely unable to believe that a\nbridgeman was standing up to him. He scowled darkly, lowering his spear\nto his side, its butt against the ground. “I don’t want to wait.”\n“How unfortunate,” Kaladin said, stepping right up to the man,\nmeeting him eye to eye. Silently, he cursed the idiot. If it turned into a\nscuffle…\nThe soldier hesitated, even more astonished to see such an aggressive\nthreat from a bridgeman. Kaladin wasn’t as thick-armed as this man, but he\nwas a finger or two taller. The soldier’s uncertainty showed in his face.\nJust back down, Kaladin thought.\nBut no. Backing down from a bridgeman while his squad was\nwatching? The man made a fist, knuckles cracking.\nWithin seconds, the entire bridge crew was there. The soldier blinked\nas Bridge Four formed around Kaladin in an aggressive inverted wedge\npattern, moving naturally—smoothly—as Kaladin had trained them. Each\none made fists, giving the soldier ample chance to see that the heavy lifting\nhad trained these men to a physical level beyond that of the average soldier.\nThe man glanced back at his squad, as if looking for support.\n“Do you want to spark a fight now, friend?” Kaladin asked softly. “If\nyou hurt the bridgemen, I wonder who Sadeas will make run this bridge.”\nThe man glanced back at Kaladin, was silent for a moment, then\nscowled, cursed, and stalked away. “Probably full of crem anyway,” he\nmuttered, rejoining his team.\nThe members of Bridge Four relaxed, though they received more than\na few appreciative looks from the other soldiers in line. For once, there was\nsomething other than scowls. Hopefully they wouldn’t realize that a squad\nof bridgemen had quickly and accurately made a battle formation\ncommonly used in spear fighting.\nKaladin waved for his men to stand down, nodding his thanks. They\nfell back, and Kaladin tossed the recovered waterskin back to Lopen.\nThe shorter man smirked wryly. “I’ll keep a tighter grip on these things\nfrom now on, gancho.” He eyed the soldier who had tried to take the water.\n“What?” Kaladin asked.\n“Well, I’ve got a cousin in the water crews, you see,” Lopen said.\n“And I’m thinking that he might owe me a favor on account of this one time\nI helped his sister’s friend escape a guy looking for her….”\n“You do have a lot of cousins.”"

You bother one of us, you bother us all. That’s\nsomething you strawheads never seem to get. No offense or anything,\ngancho.”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow. “Don’t make trouble for the soldier. Not\ntoday.” I’ll make enough of that myself here soon.\nLopen sighed, but nodded. “All right. For you.” He held up a\nwaterskin. “You sure you don’t want any?”\nKaladin didn’t; his stomach was too unsettled. But he made himself\ntake the waterskin back and drink a few mouthfuls.\nBefore long, the time came to cross and pull the bridge up for the last\nrun. The assault. Sadeas’s soldiers were forming ranks, lighteyes riding\nback and forth, calling orders. Matal waved Kaladin’s crew forward.\nDalinar Kholin’s army had fallen behind, coming more slowly because of\nhis larger numbers.\nKaladin took his place at the very front of his bridge. Ahead, the\nParshendi were lined up with bows on the edge of their plateau, staring\ndown the oncoming assault. Were they singing already? Kaladin thought he\ncould hear their voices.\nMoash was on Kaladin’s right, Rock on his left. Only three on the\ndeathline, because of how shorthanded they were. He’d put Shen in the very\nback, so he wouldn’t see what Kaladin was about to do.\n“I’m going to duck out from underneath once we start moving,”\nKaladin told them. “Rock, you take over. Keep them running.”\n“Very well,” Rock said. “It will be hard to carry without you. We have\nso few men, and we are very weak.”\n“You’ll manage. You’ll have to.”\nKaladin couldn’t see Rock’s face, not positioned under the bridge as\nthey were, but his voice sounded troubled. “This thing you will try, is\ndangerous?”\n“Perhaps.”\n“Can I help?”\n“I’m afraid not, my friend. But it strengthens me to hear you ask.”\nRock didn’t get a chance to reply. Matal yelled for the bridge crews to\ngo. Arrows shot overhead to distract the Parshendi. Bridge Four broke into\na run.\nAnd Kaladin ducked down and dashed out in front of them. Lopen was\nwaiting to the side, and he tossed Kaladin the sack of armor.\nMatal screamed at Kaladin in a panic, but the bridge crews were\nalready in motion. Kaladin focused on his goal, protecting Bridge Four, and\nsucked in sharply. Stormlight flooded him from the pouch at his waist, but\nhe didn’t draw too much. Just enough to give him a jolt of energy.\nSyl zipped in front of him, a ripple in the air, nearly invisible. Kaladin\nwhipped the tie off the sack, pulling out the vest and throwing it awkwardly\nover his head. He ignored the ties at the side, getting on the helm as he\nleaped over a small rock formation.

The shield came last, clattering with red\nParshendi bones in a crisscross pattern on the front.\nEven while donning the armor, Kaladin easily stayed far ahead of the\nheavily laden bridge crews. His Stormlight-infused legs were quick and\nsure.\nThe Parshendi archers directly ahead of him abruptly stopped singing.\nSeveral of them lowered their bows, and though it was too distant to make\nout their faces, he could sense their outrage. Kaladin had expected this.\nHe’d hoped for it.\nThe Parshendi left their dead. Not because they were uncaring, but\nbecause they found it a terrible offense to move them. Merely touching the\ndead seemed a sin. If that was the case, a man desecrating corpses and\nwearing them into battle would be far, far worse.\nAs Kaladin grew closer, a different song started among the Parshendi\narchers. A quick, violent song, more chant than melody. Those who had\nlowered their bows raised them.\nAnd they tried with everything they had to kill him.\nArrows flew at him. Dozens of them. They weren’t fired in careful\nwaves. They flew individually, rapidly, wildly, each archer loosing at\nKaladin as quickly as he could. A swarm of death bore down on him.\nPulse racing, Kaladin ducked to the left, leaping off a small\noutcropping. Arrows sliced the air around him, dangerously close. But\nwhile infused with the Stormlight, his muscles reacted quickly. He dodged\nbetween arrows, then turned in the other direction, moving erratically.\nBehind, Bridge Four came into range, and not a single arrow was fired\nat them. Other bridge crews were ignored as well, many of the archers\nfocusing on Kaladin. The arrows came more swiftly, spraying around him,\nbouncing off his shield. One sliced open his arm as it shot past; another\nsnapped against his helm, nearly knocking it free.\nThe arm wound leaked Light, not blood, and to Kaladin’s amazement\nit slowly began to seal up, frost crystallizing on his skin and Stormlight\ndraining from him. He drew in more, infusing himself to the cusp of\nglowing visibly. He ducked, he dodged, he jumped, he ran.\nHis battle-trained reflexes delighted in the newfound speed, and he\nused the shield to knock arrows out of the air. It was as if his body had\nlonged for this ability, as if it had been born to take advantage of the\nStormlight. During the earlier part of his life, he had lived sluggish and\nimpotent. Now he was healed. Not acting beyond his capacities—no, finally\nreaching them.\nA flock of arrows sought his blood, but Kaladin spun between them,\ntaking another slice on the arm but deflecting the others with shield or\nbreastplate. The flight came, and he brought his shield up, worried that\nhe was going to be too slow. However, the arrows changed course, arcing\ntoward his shield, slamming into it. Drawn to it.\nI’m pulling them to it! He remembered dozens of bridge runs, with\narrows slamming into the wood near where his hands had clung to the\nsupport bars.

How many arrows\ndid I draw to the bridge, pulling them away from me?\nHe didn’t have time to think about that. He kept moving, dodging. He\nfelt arrows whish through the air, heard them zip, felt the splinters as they\nhit stone or shield and broke. He’d hoped that he would distract some of the\nParshendi from firing on his men, but he’d had no idea how strong a\nreaction he’d get.\nPart of him exulted in the thrill of ducking, dodging, and blocking the\nhail of arrows. He started to slow, however. He tried to suck in Stormlight,\nbut none came. His spheres were drained. He panicked, still dodging, but\nthen the arrowfalls began to slacken.\nWith a start, Kaladin realized that the bridge crews had parted around\nhim, leaving a space for him to keep dodging while they passed him and set\ntheir burdens. Bridge Four was in place, cavalry charging across to attack\nthe archers. Despite that, some of the Parshendi continued to fire on\nKaladin, enraged. The soldiers cut these Parshendi down easily, sweeping\nthe ground of them and making room for Sadeas’s foot soldiers.\nKaladin lowered his shield. It bristled with arrows. He barely had time\nto take a fresh breath of air as the bridgemen reached him, calling out with\njoy, nearly tackling him in their excitement.\n“You fool!” Moash said. “You storming fool! What was that? What\nwere you thinking?”\n“Was incredible,” Rock said.\n“You should be dead!” Sigzil said, though his normally stern face was\nsplit by a smile.\n“Stormfather,” Moash added, pulling an arrow from Kaladin’s vest at\nthe shoulder. “Look at these.”\nKaladin looked down, shocked to find a dozen arrow holes in the sides\nof his vest and shirt where he’d narrowly avoided being hit. Three arrows\nstuck from the leather.\n“Stormblessed,” Skar said. “That’s all there is too it.”\nKaladin shrugged off their praise, his heart still pounding. He was\nnumb. Amazed that he’d survived, cold from the Stormlight he’d consumed,\nexhausted as if he’d run a rigorous obstacle course. He looked to Teft,\nraising an eyebrow, nodding toward the pouch at his waist.\nTeft shook his head. He’d watched; the Stormlight rising from Kaladin\nhadn’t been visible to those observing, not in the light of day. Still, the way\nKaladin had dodged would have looked incredible, even without the\nobvious light. If there had been stories about him before, they would grow\ngreatly following this.\nHe turned to look at the passing troops. As he did, he realized\nsomething. He still had to deal with Matal. “Fall into line, men,” he said.\nThey obeyed reluctantly, falling into place around him in a double\nrank. Ahead, Matal stood beside their bridge. He looked concerned, as well\nhe should. Sadeas was riding up. Kaladin steeled himself, remembering\nhow his previous victory—when they’d run with the bridge on its side—had"

He hesitated, then hurried over toward the bridge\nwhere Sadeas was going to ride past Matal. Kaladin’s men followed.\nKaladin arrived as Matal bowed to Sadeas, who wore his glorious red\nShardplate. Kaladin and the bridgemen bowed as well.\n“Avarak Matal,” Sadeas said. He nodded toward Kaladin. “This man\nlooks familiar.”\n“He is the one from before, Brightlord,” Matal said, nervous. “The one\nwho…”\n“Ah yes,” Sadeas said. “The ‘miracle.’ And you sent him forward as a\ndecoy like that? One would think that you would be hesitant to dare such\nmeasures.”\n“I take full responsibility, Brightlord,” Matal said, putting the best face\non it.\nSadeas regarded the battlefield. “Well, luckily for you, it worked. I\nsuppose I’ll have to promote you now.” He shook his head. “Those savages\npractically ignored the assault force. All twenty bridges set, most with nary\na casualty. It seems like a waste, somehow. Consider yourself commended.\nMost remarkable, the way that boy dodged…” He kicked his horse into\nmotion, leaving Matal and the bridgemen behind.\nIt was the most backhanded promotion Kaladin had ever heard, but\nthat would do. Kaladin smiled broadly as Matal turned to him, eyes\nenraged.\n“You—” Matal sputtered. “You could have gotten me executed!”\n“Instead I got you promoted,” Kaladin said, Bridge Four forming\naround him.\n“I should see you strung up anyway.”\n“It’s been tried,” Kaladin said. “Didn’t work. Besides, you know that\nfrom now on Sadeas is going to expect me to be out there distracting the\narchers. Good luck getting any other bridgeman to try that.”\nMatal’s face grew red. He turned and stalked away to check on the\nother bridge crews. The two nearest—Bridge Seven and Bridge Eighteen—\nstood looking toward Kaladin and his team. All twenty bridges had been\nset? Hardly any casualties?\nStormfather, Kaladin thought. How many archers were firing at me?\n“You did it, Kaladin!” Moash exclaimed. “You found the secret. We\nneed to make this work. Expand it.”\n“I’ll bet I could dodge those arrows, if that were all I was doing,” Skar\nsaid. “With enough armor…”\n“We should have more than one,” Moash agreed. “Five or so, running\naround drawing the Parshendi attacks.”\n“The bones,” Rock said, folding his arms. “This is what made it work.\nThe Parshendi were so mad that they ignored bridge crew. If all five wear\nthe bones of Parshendi…”\nThat made Kaladin consider something. He looked back, searching\nthrough the bridgemen. Where was Shen?\nThere. He was sitting on the rocks, distant, staring forward. Kaladin\napproached with the others. The parshman looked up at him, face a mask of\npain, tears streaking his cheeks. He looked at Kaladin and shuddered"

He looked at Kaladin and shuddered\nvisibly, turning away, closing his eyes.\n“He sat down like that the moment he saw what you’d done, lad,” Teft\nsaid, rubbing his chin. “Might not be good for bridge runs anymore.”\nKaladin pulled the carapacetied helm off his head, then ran his fingers\nthrough his hair. The carapace stuck to his clothing stank faintly, even\nthough he’d washed it off down below. “We’ll see,” Kaladin said, feeling a\ntwist of guilt. Not nearly enough to overshadow the victory of protecting his\nmen, but enough to dampen it, at least. “For now, there are still many bridge\ncrews that got fired upon. You know what to do.”\nThe men nodded, trotting off to search for the wounded. Kaladin set\none man to watch over Shen—he wasn’t sure what else to do with the\nparshman—and tried not to show his exhaustion as he put his sweaty,\ncarapace-covered cap and vest in Lopen’s litter. He knelt down to go\nthrough his medical equipment, in case it was needed, and found that his\nhand was shaking and quivering. He pressed it down against the ground to\nstill it, breathing in and out.\nCold, clammy skin, he thought. Nausea. Weakness. He was in shock.\n“You all right, lad?” Teft asked, kneeling down beside Kaladin. He still\nwore a bandage on his arm from the wound he’d taken a few bridge runs\nback, but it wasn’t enough to stop him from carrying. Not when there were\ntoo few as it was.\n“I’ll be fine,” Kaladin said, taking out a waterskin, holding it in a\nquivering hand. He could barely get the top off.\n“You don’t look—”\n“I’ll be fine,” Kaladin said again, drinking, then lowering the water.\n“What’s important is that the men are safe.”\n“You going to do this every time. Whenever we go to battle?”\n“Whatever keeps them safe.”\n“You’re not immortal, Kaladin,” Teft said softly. “The Radiants, they\ncould be killed, just like any man. Sooner or later, one of those arrows will\nfind your neck instead of your shoulder.”\n“The Stormlight heals.”\n“The Stormlight helps your body heal. That’s different, I’m thinking.”\nTeft laid a hand on Kaladin’s shoulder. “We can’t lose you, lad. The men\nneed you.”\n“I’m not going to avoid putting myself in danger, Teft. And I’m not\ngoing to leave the men to face a storm of arrows if I can do something\nabout it.”\n“Well,” Teft said, “you are going to let a few of us go out there with\nyou. The bridge can manage with twenty-five, if it has to. That leaves us a\nfew extra, just like Rock said. And I’ll bet some of those wounded from the\nother crews we saved are well enough to begin helping carry. They won’t\ndare send them back to their own crews, not so long as Bridge Four is doing\nwhat you did today, and helping the whole assault work.”\n“I…” Kaladin trailed off. He could imagine Dallet doing something"

He could imagine Dallet doing something\nlike this. He’d always said that as sergeant, part of his job was to keep\nKaladin alive. “All right.”\nTeft nodded, rising.\n“You were a spearman, Teft,” Kaladin said. “Don’t try to deny it. How\ndid you end up here, in these bridge crews?”\n“It’s where I belong.” Teft turned away to supervise the search for\nwounded.\nKaladin sat down, then lay back, waiting for the shock to wear off. To\nthe south, the other army—flying the blue of Dalinar Kholin—had arrived.\nThey crossed to an adjacent plateau.\nKaladin closed his eyes to recover. Eventually, he heard something and\nopened his eyes. Syl sat cross-legged on his chest. Behind her, Dalinar\nKholin’s army had begun an assault onto the battlefield, and they managed\nto do so without getting fired on. Sadeas had the Parshendi cut off.\n“That was amazing,” Kaladin said to Syl. “What I did with the\narrows.”\n“Still think you’re cursed?”\n“No. I know I’m not.” He looked up at the overcast sky. “But that\nmeans the failures were all just me. I let Tien die, I failed my spearmen, the\nslaves I tried to rescue, Tarah…” He hadn’t thought of her in some time.\nHis failure with her had been different from the others, but a failure it was\nnonetheless. “If there’s no curse or bad luck, no god above being angry at\nme—I have to live with knowing that with a little more eff ort—a little\nmore practice or skill—I could have saved them.”\nSyl frowned more deeply. “Kaladin, you need to get over this. Those\nthings aren’t your fault.”\n“That’s what my father always used to say.” He smiled faintly.\n“‘Overcome your guilt, Kaladin. Care, but not too much. Take\nresponsibility, but don’t blame yourself.’ Protect, save, help—but know\nwhen to give up. They’re such precarious ledges to walk. How do I do it?”\n“I don’t know. I don’t know any of this, Kaladin. But you’re ripping\nyourself apart. Inside and out.”\nKaladin stared at the sky above. “It was wondrous. I was a storm, Syl.\nThe Parshendi couldn’t touch me. The arrows were nothing.”\n“You’re too new to this. You pushed yourself too hard.”\n“‘Save them,’” Kaladin whispered. “‘Do the impossible, Kaladin. But\ndon’t push yourself too hard. But also don’t feel guilty if you fail.’\nPrecarious ledges, Syl. So narrow…”\nSome of his men returned with a wounded man, a square-faced\nThaylen fellow with an arrow in the shoulder. Kaladin went to work. His\nhands were still shaking slightly, but not nearly as badly as they had been.\nThe bridgemen clustered around, watching. He’d started training Rock,\nDrehy, and Skar already, but with all of them watching, Kaladin found"

Wash the wound to make sure there aren’t any\nslivers of wood or bits of metal left, then sew it. The muscles and skin of\nthe shoulder here are going to get worked, so you need a strong thread to\nhold the wound together. Now…”\n“Kaladin,” Lopen said, sounding worried.\n“Wha?” Kaladin said, distracted, still working.\n“Kaladin!”\nLopen had called him by his name, rather than saying gancho. Kaladin\nstood up, turning to see the short Herdazian man standing at the back of the\ncrowd, pointing at the chasm. The battle had moved farther north, but a\ngroup of Parshendi had punched through Sadeas’s line. They had bows.\nKaladin watched, stunned, as the group of Parshendi fell into\nformation and nocked. Fifty arrows, all pointed at Kaladin’s crew. The\nParshendi didn’t seem to care that they were exposing themselves to attack\nfrom behind. They seemed focused on only one thing.\nDestroying Kaladin and his men.\nKaladin screamed the alarm, but he felt so sluggish, so tired. The\nbridgemen around him turned as the archers drew. Sadeas’s men normally\ndefended the chasm to keep Parshendi from pushing over the bridges and\ncutting off their escape. But this time, noticing that the archers weren’t\ntrying to drop the bridges, the soldiers didn’t hasten to stop them. They left\nthe bridgemen to die, instead cutting off the Parshendi route to the bridges\nthemselves.\nKaladin’s men were exposed. Perfect targets. No, Kaladin thought. No!\nIt can’t happen like this. Not after—\nA force crashed into the Parshendi line. A single figure in slate-grey\narmor, wielding a sword as long as many men were tall. The Shardbearer\nswept through the distracted archers with urgency, slicing into their ranks.\nArrows flew toward Kaladin’s team, but they were loosed too early, aimed\npoorly. A few came close as the bridgemen ducked for cover, but nobody\nwas hit.\nParshendi fell before the sweeping Blade of the Shardbearer, some\ntoppling into the chasm, others scrambling back. The rest died with burned-\nout eyes. In seconds, the squad of fifty archers had been reduced to corpses.\nThe Shardbearer’s honor guard caught up with him. He turned, armor\nseeming to glow as he raised his Blade in a salute of respect toward the\nbridgemen. Then he charged off in another direction.\n“That was him,” Drehy said, standing up. “Dalinar Kholin. The king’s\nuncle!”\n“He saved us!” Lopen said.\n“Bah.” Moash dusted himself off. “He just saw a group of undefended\narchers and took the chance to strike. Lighteyes don’t care about us. Right,\nKaladin?”"

Right,\nKaladin?”\nKaladin stared at the place where the archers had stood. In one\nmoment, he could have lost it all.\n“Kaladin?” Moash said.\n“You’re right,” Kaladin found himself saying. “Just an opportunity\ntaken.”\nExcept, why raise the Blade toward Kaladin?\n“From now on,” Kaladin said, “we pull back farther after the soldiers\ncross. They used to ignore us after the battle began, but they won’t any\nlonger. What I did today—what we’re all going to be doing soon—will\nmake them mighty angry. Angry enough to be stupid, but also angry enough\nto see us dead. For now, Leyten, Narm, find good scouting points and watch\nthe field. I want to know if any Parshendi make moves toward that chasm.\nI’ll get this man bandaged and we’ll pull back.”\nThe two scouts ran off, and Kaladin turned back to the man with the\nwounded shoulder.\nMoash knelt beside him. “An assault against a prepared foe without\nany bridges lost, a Shardbearer coincidentally coming to our rescue, Sadeas\nhimself complimenting us. You almost make me think I should get one of\nthose armbands.”\nKaladin glanced down at the prayer. It was stained with blood from a\nslice on his arm that the vanishing Stormlight hadn’t quite been able to heal.\n“Wait to see if we escape.” Kaladin finished his stitching. “That’s the\nreal test.”\n“I wish to sleep. I know now why you do what you do, and I hate you\nfor it. I will not speak of the truths I see.”\n—Kakashah 1173, 142 seconds pre-death. A Shin sailor, left behind by\nhis crew, reportedly for bringing them ill luck. Sample largely useless.\n“You see?” Leyten turned the piece of carapace over in his hands. “If we\ncarve it up at the edge, it encourages a blade—or in this case an arrow—to\ndeflect away from the face. Wouldn’t want to spoil that pretty grin of\nyours.”\nKaladin smiled, taking back the piece of armor. Leyten had carved it\nexpertly, putting in holes for leather straps to affix it to the jerkin. The\nchasm was cold and dark at night. With the sky hidden, it felt like a cavern.\nOnly the occasional sparkle of a star high above revealed otherwise.\n“How soon can you have them done?” he asked Leyten.\n“All five? By the end of the night, likely. The real trick was\ndiscovering how to work it.” He knocked on the carapace with the back of\nhis knuckles. “Amazing stuff. Nearly as hard as steel, but half the weight.\nHard to cut or break. But if you drill, it shapes easily.”\n“Good,” Kaladin said. “Because I don’t want five sets. I want one for\neach man in the crew.”\nLeyten raised an eyebrow.\n“If they’re going to start letting us wear armor,” Kaladin said,\n“everyone gets a suit. Except Shen, of course.” Matal had agreed to let them"

Except Shen, of course.” Matal had agreed to let them\nleave him behind on the bridge runs; he wouldn’t even look at Kaladin now.\nLeyten nodded. “All right, then. Better get me some help, though.”\n“You can use the wounded men. We’ll cart out as much carapace as we\ncan find.”\nHis success had translated to an easier time for Bridge Four. Kaladin\nhad pled that his men needed time to find carapace, and Hashal—not\nknowing any better—had reduced the scavenging quota. She was already\npretending—quite smoothly—that the armor had been her idea the entire\ntime, and was ignoring the question of where it had come from in the first\nplace. When she met Kaladin’s eyes, however, he saw worry. What else\nwould he try? So far, she hadn’t dared remove him. Not while he brought\nher so much praise from Sadeas.\n“How did an apprentice armorer end up as a bridgeman anyway?”\nKaladin asked as Leyten settled back down to work. He was a thick-armed\nman, stout and oval-faced with light hair. “Craftsmen don’t usually get\nthrown away.”\nLeyten shrugged. “When a piece of armor breaks and a lighteyes takes\nan arrow in the shoulder, someone has to take the blame. I’m convinced my\nmaster keeps an extra apprentice especially for those kinds of situation.”\n“Well, his loss is our good fortune. You’re going to keep us alive.”\n“I’ll do my best, sir.” He smiled. “Can’t do much worse on the armor\nthan you did yourself, though. It’s amazing that breastplate didn’t fall off\nhalfway through!”\nKaladin patted the bridgeman on the shoulder, then left him to his\nwork, surrounded by a small ring of topaz chips; Kaladin had gotten\npermission to bring them, explaining his men needed light to work on the\narmor. Nearby, Lopen, Rock, and Dabbid were returning with another load\nof salvage. Syl zipped ahead, leading them.\nKaladin walked down the chasm, a garnet sphere looped in a small\nleather carrier at his belt for light. The chasm branched here, making a large\ntriangular intersection—a perfect place for spear training. Wide enough to\ngive the men room to practice, yet far enough from any permanent bridges\nthat scouts weren’t likely to hear echoes.\nKaladin gave the initial instructions each day, then let Teft lead the\npractice. The men worked by sphere light, small piles of diamond chips at\nthe corners of the intersection, barely enough to see by. Never thought I’d\nenvy those days practicing beneath the hot sun back in Amaram’s army, he\nthought.\nHe walked up to gap-toothed Hobber and corrected his stance, then\nshowed him how to set his weight behind his spear thrusts. The bridgemen\nwere progressing quickly, and the fundamentals were proving their merit.\nSome were training with the spear and the shield, practicing stances where\nthey held lighter spears up beside the head with the shield raised.\nThe most skilled were Skar and Moash. In fact, Moash was\nsurprisingly good. Kaladin walked to the side, watching the hawk-faced"

Kaladin walked to the side, watching the hawk-faced\nman. He was focused, eyes intense, jaw set. He moved in attack after attack,\nthe dozen spheres giving him an equal number of shadows.\nKaladin remembered feeling such dedication. He’d spent a year like\nthat, after Tien’s death, driving himself to exhaustion each day. Determined\nto get better. Determined never to let another person die because of his lack\nof skill. He’d become the best in his squad, then the best in his company.\nSome said he’d been the best spearmen in Amaram’s army.\nWhat would have happened to him, if Tarah hadn’t coaxed him out of\nhis single-minded dedication? Would he have burned himself out, as she’d\nclaimed?\n“Moash,” Kaladin called.\nMoash paused, turning toward Kaladin. He didn’t fall out of stance.\nKaladin waved him to approach, and Moash reluctantly trotted over.\nLopen had left a few waterskins for them, hanging by their cords from a\ncluster of haspers. Kaladin pulled a skin free, tossing it to Moash. The other\nman took a drink, then wiped his mouth.\n“You’re getting good,” Kaladin said. “You’re probably the best we\nhave.”\n“Thanks,” Moash said.\n“I’ve noticed you keep training when Teft lets the other men take\nbreaks. Dedication is good, but don’t work yourself ragged. I want you to\nbe one of the decoys.”\nMoash smiled broadly. Each of the men had volunteered to be one of\nthe four who would join Kaladin distracting the Parshendi. It was amazing.\nMonths ago, Moash—along with the others—had eagerly placed the new or\nthe weak at the front of the bridge to catch arrows. Now, to a man, they\nvolunteered for the most dangerous jobs.\nDo you realize what you could have in these men, Sadeas? Kaladin\nthought. If you weren’t so busy thinking of how to get them killed?\n“So what is it for you?” Kaladin said, nodding toward the dim practice\nground. “Why do you work so hard? What is it you hunt?”\n“Vengeance,” the other man said, face somber.\nKaladin nodded. “I lost someone once. Because I wasn’t good enough\nwith the spear. I nearly killed myself practicing.”\n“Who was it?”\n“My brother.”\nMoash nodded. The other bridgemen, Moash included, seemed to\nregard Kaladin’s “mysterious” past with reverence.\n“I’m glad I trained,” Kaladin said. “And I’m glad you’re dedicated.\nBut you have to be careful. If I’d gotten myself killed by working so hard, it\nwouldn’t have meant anything.”\n“Sure. But there’s a difference between us, Kaladin.”\nKaladin raised an eyebrow.\n“You wanted to be able to save someone. Me, I want to kill\nsomebody.”\n“Who?”\nMoash hesitated, then shook his head. “Maybe I’ll say, someday.” He\nreached out, grabbing Kaladin on the shoulder. “I’d surrendered my plans,"

I’ll guard you with my life, Kaladin. I\nswear it to you, by the blood of my fathers.”\nKaladin met Moash’s intense eyes and nodded. “All right, then. Go\nhelp Hobber and Yake. They’re still off on their thrusts.”\nMoash jogged off to do as told. He didn’t call Kaladin “sir,” and didn’t\nseem to regard him with the same unspoken reverence as the others. That\nmade Kaladin more comfortable with him.\nKaladin spent the next hour helping the men, one by one. Most of them\nwere overeager, throwing themselves into their attacks. Kaladin explained\nthe importance of control and precision, which won more fights than\nchaotic enthusiasm. They took it in, listening. More and more, they\nreminded him of his old spear squad.\nThat set him thinking. He remembered how he had felt when originally\nproposing the escape plan to the men. He’d been looking for something to\ndo—a way to fight, no matter how risky. A chance. Things had changed. He\nnow had a team he was proud of, friends he had come to love, and a\npossibility—perhaps—for stability.\nIf they could get the dodging and armor right, they might be\nreasonably safe. Maybe even as safe as his old spear squad had been. Was\nrunning still the best option?\n“That is a worried face,” a rumbling voice noted. Kaladin turned as\nRock walked up and leaned against the wall near him, folding powerful\nforearms. “Is the face of a leader, say I. Always troubled.” Rock raised a\nbushy red eyebrow.\n“Sadeas will never let us go, particularly not now that we’re so\nprominent.” Alethi lighteyes considered it reprehensible for a man to let\nslaves escape; it made him seem impotent. Capturing those who ran away\nwas essential to save face.\n“You said this thing before,” Rock said. “We will fight the men he\nsends after us, will seek Kharbranth, where there are no slaves. From there,\nthe Peaks, to my people who will welcome us as heroes!”\n“We might beat the first group, if he’s foolish and sends only a few\ndozen men. But after that he’ll send more. And what of our wounded? Do\nwe leave them here to die? Or do we take them with us and go that much\nmore slowly?”\nRock nodded slowly. “You are saying that we need a plan.”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said. “I guess that’s what I’m saying. Either that, or we\nstay here… as bridgemen.”\n“Ha!” Rock seemed to take it as a joke. “Despite new armor, we would\ndie soon. We make ourselves targets!”\nKaladin hesitated. Rock was right. The bridgemen would be used, day\nin and day out. Even if Kaladin slowed the death toll to two or three men a\nmonth—once, he would have considered that impossible, but now it seemed\nwithin reach—Bridge Four as it was currently composed would be gone\nwithin a year."

There must be a way to\nescape this trap, a way to disappear. A false trail? A distraction? Perhaps we\ncan convince Sadeas that we have died during bridge run.”\n“How would we do that?”\n“Don’t know,” Rock said. “But we will think.” He nodded to Kaladin\nand sauntered off toward Sigzil. The Azish man was practicing with the\nothers. Kaladin had tried speaking to him about Hoid, but Sigzil—typically\nclosemouthed—hadn’t wanted to discuss it.\n“Hey, Kaladin!” Skar called. He was part of an advanced group that\nwas going through Teft’s very carefully supervised sparring. “Come spar\nwith us. Show these rock-brained fools how it’s really done.” The others\nbegan calling for him as well.\nKaladin waved them down, shaking his head.\nTeft trotted over, a heavy spear on one shoulder. “Lad,” he said quietly,\n“I think it would be good for their morale if you showed them a thing or\ntwo yourself.”\n“I’ve already given them instruction.”\n“With a spear you knocked the head off of. Going very slowly, with\nlots of talk. They need to see it, lad. See you.”\n“We’ve been through this, Teft.”\n“Well, so we have.”\nKaladin smiled. Teft was careful not to look angry or belligerent—he\nlooked as if he were having a normal conversation with Kaladin. “You’ve\nbeen a sergeant before, haven’t you?”\n“Never mind that. Come on, just show them a few simple routines.”\n“No, Teft,” Kaladin said, more seriously.\nTeft eyed him. “You going to refuse to fight on the battlefield, just like\nthat Horneater?”\n“It’s not like that.”\n“Well what is it like?”\nKaladin reached for an explanation. “I’ll fight when the time comes.\nBut if I let myself get back into it now, I’ll be too eager. I’ll push to attack\nnow. I’ll have trouble waiting until the men are ready. Trust me, Teft.”\nTeft studied him. “You’re scared of it, lad.”\n“What? No. I—”\n“I can see it,” Teft said. “And I’ve seen it before. Last time you fought\nfor someone, you failed, eh? So now you hesitate to take it up again.”\nKaladin paused. “Yes,” he admitted. But it was more than that. When\nhe fought again, he would have to become that man from long ago, the man\nwho had been called Stormblessed. The man with confidence and strength.\nHe wasn’t certain he could be that man any longer. That was what scared\nhim.\nOnce he held that spear again, there would be no turning back.\n“Well.” Teft rubbed his chin. “When the time comes, I hope you’re\nready. Because this lot will need you.”\nKaladin nodded and Teft hurried back to the others, giving some kind\nof explanation to mollify them."

A rickshaw puller.\n“I couldn’t decide if you were interested or not,” Navani said softly to\nDalinar as they slowly walked around the grounds of Elhokar’s raised field\npalace. “Half the time, you seemed like a flirt—offering hints at courtship,\nthen backing away. The other half of the time, I was certain I had misread\nyou. And Gavilar was so forthcoming. He always did prefer to seize what\nhe wished.”\nDalinar nodded thoughtfully. He wore his blue uniform, while Navani\nwas in a subdued maroon dress with a thick hem. Elhokar’s gardeners had\nbegun to cultivate the plant life here. To their right, a twisting length of\nyellow shalebark rose to waist height, like a railing. The stonelike plant was\novergrown by small bunches of haspers with pearly shells slowly opening\nand closing as they breathed. They looked like tiny mouths, silently\nspeaking in rhythm with one another.\nDalinar and Navani’s pathway took a leisurely course up the hillside.\nDalinar strolled with hands clasped behind his back. His honor guard and\nNavani’s clerks followed behind. A few of them looked perplexed at the\namount of time Dalinar and Navani were spending with one another. How\nmany of them suspected the truth? All? Part? None? Did it matter? “I didn’t\nmean to confuse you, all those years ago,” he said, voice soft to keep it\nfrom prying ears. “I had intended to court you, but Gavilar expressed a\npreference for you. So I eventually felt I had to step aside.”\n“Just like that?” Navani asked. She sounded offended.\n“He didn’t realize that I was interested. He thought that by introducing\nyou to him, I was indicating that he should court you. That was often how\nour relationship worked; I would discover people Gavilar should know, then\nbring them to him. I didn’t realize until too late what I had done in giving\nyou to him.”\n“‘Giving’ me? Is there a slave’s brand on my forehead of which I’ve\nbeen unaware?”\n“I did not mean—”\n“Oh hush,” Navani said, her voice suddenly fond. Dalinar stifled a\nsigh; though Navani had matured since their youth, her moods always had\nchanged as quickly as the seasons. In truth, that was part of her allure.\n“Did you often step aside for him?” Navani asked.\n“Always.”\n“Didn’t that grow tiresome?”\n“I didn’t think about it much,” Dalinar said. “When I did… yes, I was\nfrustrated. But it was Gavilar. You know how he was. That force of will,\nthat air of natural entitlement. It always seemed to surprise him when\nsomeone denied him or when the world itself didn’t do as he wished. He"

He\ndidn’t force me to defer—it was simply how life was.”\nNavani nodded in understanding.\n“Regardless,” Dalinar said, “I apologize for confusing you. I… well, I\nhad difficulty letting go. I fear that—on occasion—I let too much of my\ntrue feelings slip out.”\n“Well, I suppose I can forgive that,” she said. “Though you did spend\nthe next two de cades making certain I thought you hated me.”\n“I did nothing of the sort!”\n“Oh? And how else was I to interpret your coldness? The way you\nwould often leave the room when I arrived?”\n“Containing myself,” Dalinar said. “I had made my decision.”\n“Well, it looked a lot like hatred,” Navani said. “Though I did wonder\nseveral times what you were hiding behind those stony eyes of yours. Of\ncourse, then Shshshsh came along.”\nAs always, when the name of his wife was spoken, it came to him as\nthe sound of softly rushing air, then slipped from his mind immediately. He\ncould not hear, or remember, the name.\n“She changed everything,” Navani said. “You truly seemed to love\nher.”\n“I did,” Dalinar said. Surely he had loved her. Hadn’t he? He could\nremember nothing. “What was she like?” He quickly added, “I mean, in\nyour opinion. How did you see her?”\n“Everyone loved Shshshsh,” Navani said. “I tried hard to hate her, but\nin the end, I could only be mildly jealous.”\n“You? Jealous of her? Whatever for?”\n“Because,” Navani said. “She fit you so well, never making\ninappropriate comments, never bullying those around her, always so calm.”\nNavani smiled. “Thinking back, I really should have been able to hate her.\nBut she was just so nice. Though she wasn’t very… well…”\n“What?” Dalinar asked.\n“Clever,” Navani said. She blushed, which was rare for her. “I’m sorry,\nDalinar, but she just wasn’t. She wasn’t a fool, but… well… not everyone\ncan be cunning. Perhaps that was part of her charm.”\nShe seemed to think that Dalinar would be offended. “It’s all right,” he\nsaid. “Were you surprised that I married her?”\n“Who could be surprised? As I said, she was perfect for you.”\n“Because we were matched intellectually?” Dalinar said dryly.\n“Hardly. But you were matched in temperament. For a time, after I got\nover trying to hate her, I thought that the four of us could be quite close. But\nyou were so stiff toward me.”\n“I could not allow any further… lapses to make you think that I was\nstill interested.” He said the last part awkwardly. After all, wasn’t that what\nhe was doing now? Lapsing?\nNavani eyed him. “There you go again.”\n“What?”\n“Feeling guilty. Dalinar, you are a wonderful, honorable man—but you\nreally are quite prone to self-indulgence.”\nGuilt? As self-indulgence? “I never considered it that way before.”\nShe smiled deeply.\n“What?” he asked."

As self-indulgence? “I never considered it that way before.”\nShe smiled deeply.\n“What?” he asked.\n“You really are genuine, aren’t you, Dalinar?”\n“I try to be,” he said. He glanced over his shoulder. “Though the nature\nof our relationship continues to perpetuate a kind of lie.”\n“We’ve lied to nobody. Let them think, or guess, what they wish.”\n“I suppose you are right.”\n“I usually am.” She fell silent for a moment. “Do you regret what we\nhave—”\n“No,” Dalinar said sharply, the strength of his objection surprising\nhim. Navani just smiled. “No,” Dalinar continued, more gently. “I do not\nregret this, Navani. I don’t know how to proceed, but I am not going to let\ngo.”\nNavani hesitated beside a growth of tiny, fist-size rockbuds with their\nvines out like long green tongues. They were grouped almost like a\nbouquet, growing on a large oval stone placed beside the pathway.\n“I suppose it’s too much to ask for you to not feel guilty,” Navani said.\n“Can’t you let yourself bend, just a little?”\n“I’m not certain if I can. Particularly not now. Explaining why would\nbe difficult.”\n“Could you try to? For me?”\n“I… Well, I’m a man of extremes, Navani. I discovered that when I\nwas a youth. I’ve learned, repeatedly, that the only way to control those\nextremes is to dedicate my life to something. First it was Gavilar. Now it’s\nthe Codes and the teachings of Nohadon. They’re the means by which I\nbind myself. Like the enclosure of a fire, meant to contain and control it.”\nHe took a deep breath. “I’m a weak man, Navani. I really am. If I give\nmyself a few feet of leeway, I burst through all of my prohibitions. The\nmomentum of following the Codes these years after Gavilar’s death is what\nkeeps me strong. If I let a few cracks into that armor, I might return to the\nman I once was. A man I never want to be again.”\nA man who had contemplated murdering his own brother for the\nthrone—and for the woman who had married that brother. But he couldn’t\nexplain that, didn’t dare let Navani know what his desire for her had once\nalmost driven him to do.\nOn that day, Dalinar had sworn that he would never hold the throne\nhimself. That was one of his restraints. Could he explain how she, without\ntrying, pried at those restraints? How it was difficult to reconcile his long-\nfermenting love for her with his guilt at finally taking for himself what he’d\nlong ago given up for his brother?\n“You are not a weak man, Dalinar,” Navani said.\n“I am. But weakness can imitate strength if bound properly, just as\ncowardice can imitate heroism if given nowhere to flee.”\n“But there’s nothing in Gavilar’s book that prohibits us. It’s just\ntradition that—”\n“It feels wrong,” Dalinar said. “But please, don’t worry; I do enough\nworrying for both of us. I will find a way to make this work; I just ask your"

It will take time. When I display frustration, it is not with\nyou, but with the situation.”\n“I suppose I can accept that. Assuming you can live with the rumors.\nThey’re starting already.”\n“They won’t be the first rumors to plague me,” he said. “I’m starting to\nworry less about them and more about Elhokar. How will we explain to\nhim?”\n“I doubt he’ll notice,” Navani said, snorting softly, resuming her walk.\nHe followed. “He’s so fixated on the Parshendi and, occasionally, the idea\nthat someone in camp is trying to kill him.”\n“This might feed into that,” Dalinar said. “He could read a number of\nconspiracies out of the two of us entering a relationship.”\n“Well, he—”\nHorns began sounding loudly from below. Dalinar and Navani stopped\nto listen and identify the call.\n“Stormfather,” Dalinar said. “That’s the Tower itself where a\nchasmfiend has been seen. It’s one of the plateaus Sadeas has been\nwatching.” Dalinar felt a surge of excitement. “Highprinces have failed\nevery time to win a gemheart there. It will be a major victory if he and I can\ndo it together.”\nNavani looked troubled. “You’re right about him, Dalinar. We do need\nhim for our cause. But keep him at arm’s length.”\n“Wish me the wind’s favor.” He reached toward her, but then stopped\nhimself. What was he going to do? Embrace her here, in public? That would\nset off the rumors like fire across a pool of oil. He wasn’t ready for that yet.\nInstead, he bowed to her, then hastened off to answer the call and collect his\nShardplate.\nIt wasn’t until he was halfway down the path that he paused to\nconsider Navani’s choice of words. She had said “We need him” for “our\ncause.”\nWhat was their cause? He doubted that Navani knew either. But she\nhad already started to think of them as together in their eff orts.\nAnd, he realized, so did he.\nThe horns called, such a pure and beautiful sound to signify the imminence\nof battle.

        "text": "into the sky. Men yelled, bells rang. And into this chaos strode Bridge Four,\nKaladin at their head. Despite the urgency, soldiers stopped, bridgemen\ngaped, carpenters and apprentices stilled.\nThirty-five men marched in rusty orange carapace armor, expertly\ncrafted by Leyten to fit onto leather jerkins and caps. They’d cut off arm\nguards and shin guards to complement the breastplates. The helms were\nbuilt from several different headpieces, and had been ornamented—at\nLeyten’s insistence—with ridges and cuts, like tiny horns or the edges of a\ncrab’s shell. The breastplates and guards were ornamented as well, cut into\ntoothlike patterns, each one reminiscent of a saw blade. Earless Jaks had\nbought blue and white paint and drawn designs across the orange armor.\nEach member of Bridge Four carried a large wooden shield strapped—\ntightly now—with red Parshendi bones. Ribs, for the most part, shaped in\nspiral patterns. Some of the men had tied finger bones to the centers so they\nwould rattle, and others had attached protruding sharp ribs to the sides of\ntheir helms, giving them the look of fangs or mandibles.\nThe onlookers watched with amazement. It wasn’t the first time they’d\nseen this armor, but this would be the first run where every man of Bridge\nFour had it. All together, it made an impressive sight.\nTen days, with six bridge runs, had allowed Kaladin and his team to\nperfect their method. Five men to be decoys with five more in the front\nholding shields and using only one arm to support the bridge. Their\nnumbers were augmented by the wounded they’d saved from other crews,\nnow strong enough to help carry.\nSo far—despite six bridge runs—there hadn’t been a single fatality.\nThe other bridgemen were whispering about a miracle. Kaladin didn’t know\nabout that. He just made certain to keep a full pouch of infused spheres with\nhim at all times. Most of the Parshendi archers seemed to focus on him.\nSomehow, they could tell that he was the center of all this.\nThey reached their bridge and formed up, shields strapped to rods on\nthe sides to await use. As they hefted their bridge, a spontaneous round of\ncheering rose up from the other crews.\n“That’s new,” Teft said from Kaladin’s left.\n“Guess they finally realized what we are,” Kaladin said.\n“And what’s that?”\nKaladin settled the bridge onto his shoulders. “We’re their champions.\nBridge forward!”\nThey broke into a trot, leading the way down from the staging yard,\nushered by cheers.\nMy father is not insane, Adolin thought, alive with energy and excitement\nas his armorers strapped on his Shardplate.\nAdolin had stewed over Navani’s revelation for days. He’d been wrong\nin such a horrible way. Dalinar Kholin wasn’t growing weak. He wasn’t\ngetting senile. He wasn’t a coward. Dalinar had been right, and Adolin had\nbeen wrong. After much soul searching, Adolin had come to a decision.\nHe was glad that he’d been wrong.\nHe grinned, flexing the fingers of his Plated hand as the armorers\nmoved to his other side.

He didn’t know what the visions meant, or what the\nimplications of those visions would be. His father was some kind of\nprophet, and that was daunting to consider.\nBut for now, it was enough that Dalinar was not insane. It was time to\ntrust him. Stormfather knew, Dalinar had earned that right from his sons.\nThe armorers finished with Adolin’s Shardplate. As they stepped away,\nAdolin hurried out of the armoring room into the sunlight, adjusting to the\ncombined strength, speed, and weight of the Shardplate. Niter and five other\nmembers of the Cobalt Guard hastened up, one bringing Sureblood to him.\nAdolin took the reins, but led the Ryshadium at first, wanting more time to\nadapt to his Plate.\nThey soon entered the staging area. Dalinar’s father, in his Shardplate,\nwas conferring with Teleb and Ilamar. He seemed to tower over them as he\npointed eastward. Already, companies of soldiers were moving out onto the\nlip of the Plains.\nAdolin strode up to his father, eager. In the near distance, he noticed a\nfigure riding down along the eastern rim of the warcamps. The figure wore\ngleaming red Shardplate.\n“Father?” Adolin said, pointing. “What’s he doing here? Shouldn’t he\nbe waiting for us to ride to his camp?”\nDalinar looked up. He waved for a groom to bring Gallant, and the two\nof them mounted. They rode down to intercept Sadeas, trailed by a dozen\nmembers of the Cobalt Guard. Did Sadeas want to call off the assault? Was\nhe worried about failing against the Tower again?\nOnce they drew close, Dalinar pulled up. “You should be moving,\nSadeas. Speed will be important, if we’re to get to the plateau before the\nParshendi take the gemheart and go.”\nThe highprince nodded. “Agreed, in part. But we need to confer first.\nDalinar, this is the Tower we’re assaulting!” He seemed eager.\n“Yes, and?”\n“Damnation, man!” Sadeas said. “You’re the one who told me we\nneeded to find a way to trap a large force of Parshendi on a plateau. The\nTower is perfect. They always bring a large force there, and two sides are\ninaccessible.”\nAdolin found himself nodding. “Yes,” he said. “Father, he’s right. If\nwe can box them in and hit them hard…” The Parshendi normally fled\nwhen they took large losses. That was one of the things extending the war\nso long.\n“It could mean a turning point in the war,” Sadeas said, eyes alight.\n“My scribes estimate that they have no more than twenty or thirty thousand\ntroops left. The Parshendi will commit ten thousand here—they always do.\nBut if we can corner and kill all of them, we could nearly destroy their\nability to wage war on these Plains.”\n“It’ll work, Father,” Adolin said eagerly. “This could be what we’ve\nbeen waiting for—what you’ve been waiting for.

A way to turn the war, a\nway to deal enough damage to the Parshendi that they can’t afford to keep\nfighting!”\n“We need troops, Dalinar,” Sadeas said. “Lots of them. How many\nmen could you field, at maximum?”\n“On short notice?” Dalinar said. “Eight thousand, perhaps.”\n“It will have to do,” Sadeas said. “I’ve managed to mobilize about\nseven thousand. We’ll bring them all. Get your eight thousand to my camp,\nand we’ll take every one of my bridge crews and march together. The\nParshendi will get there first—it’s inevitable with a plateau that close to\ntheir side—but if we can be fast enough, we can corner them on the plateau.\nThen we’ll show them what a real Alethi army is capable of!”\n“I won’t risk lives on your bridges, Sadeas,” Dalinar said. “I don’t\nknow that I can agree to a completely joint assault.”\n“Bah,” Sadeas said. “I’ve got a new way of using bridgemen, one that\ndoesn’t use nearly as many lives. Their casualties have dropped to almost\nnothing.”\n“Really?” Dalinar said. “Is it because of those bridgemen with armor?\nWhat made you change?”\nSadeas shrugged. “Perhaps you’re getting through to me. Regardless,\nwe need to go now. Together. With as many troops as they’ll have, I can’t\nrisk engaging them and waiting for you to catch up. I want to go together\nand assault as closely together as we can manage. If you’re still worried\nabout the bridgemen, I can attack first and gain a foothold, then let you\ncross without risking bridgeman lives.”\nDalinar looked thoughtful.\nCome on, Father, Adolin thought. You’ve been waiting for a chance to\nhit the Parshendi hard. This is it!\n“Very well,” Dalinar said. “Adolin, send messengers to mobilize the\nFourth through Eighth Divisions. Prepare the men to march. Let’s end this\nwar.”\n“I see them. They are the rocks. They are the vengeful spirits. Eyes of\nred.”\n—Kakakes 1173, 8 seconds pre-death. A darkeyed young woman of\nfifteen. Subject was reportedly mentally unstable since childhood.\nSeveral hours later, Dalinar stood with Sadeas on a rock formation\noverlooking the Tower itself. It had been a hard, long march. This was a\ndistant plateau, as far eastward as they had ever struck. Plateaus beyond this\npoint were impossible to take. The Parshendi could arrive so quickly that\nthey had the gemheart out before the Alethi arrived. Sometimes that\nhappened with the Tower as well.\nDalinar searched. “I see it,” he said, pointing. “They don’t have the\ngemheart out yet!” A ring of Parshendi were pounding on the chrysalis. Its\nshell was like thick stone, however. It was still holding.\n“You should be glad you’re using my bridges, old friend.” Sadeas\nshaded his face with a gauntleted hand. “Those chasms might be too wide"

        "text": "“You should be glad you’re using my bridges, old friend.” Sadeas\nshaded his face with a gauntleted hand. “Those chasms might be too wide\nfor a Shardbearer to jump.”\nDalinar nodded. The Tower was enormous; even its huge size on the\nmaps didn’t do it justice. Unlike other plateaus, it wasn’t level—instead, it\nwas shaped like an enormous wedge that dipped toward the west, pointing a\nlarge cliff face in the stormward direction. It was too steep—and the chasms\ntoo wide—to approach from the east or south. Only three adjacent plateaus\ncould provide staging areas for assaults, all along the western or\nnorthwestern side.\nThe chasms between these plateaus were unusually large, almost too\nwide for the bridges to span. On the nearby staging plateaus, thousands\nupon thousands of soldiers in blue or red were gathered, one color per\nplateau. Combined, they made for a larger force than Dalinar had ever seen\nbrought against the Parshendi.\nThe Parshendi numbers were as large as anticipated. There were at\nleast ten thousand of them lining up. This would be a full-scale battle, the\nkind Dalinar had been hoping for, the kind that would let them pit a huge\nnumber of Alethi against a large Parshendi force.\nThis could be it. The turning point in the war. Win this day, and\neverything would change.\nDalinar shaded his eyes as well, helm under his arm. He noted with\nsatisfaction that Sadeas’s scouting crews were crossing to adjacent plateaus\nwhere they could watch for Parshendi reinforcements. Just because the\nParshendi had brought so many at first didn’t mean that there were no other\nParshendi forces waiting to flank them. Dalinar and Sadeas wouldn’t be\ntaken by surprise again.\n“Come with me,” Sadeas said. “Let us assault them together! A single\ngrand wave of attack, across forty bridges!”\nDalinar looked down at the bridge crews; many of their members were\nlying exhausted on the plateau. Awaiting—likely dreading—their next task.\nVery few of them wore the armor Sadeas had spoken of. Hundreds of them\nwould be slaughtered in the assault if they attacked together. But was that\nany different from what Dalinar did, asking his men to charge into battle to\nseize the plateau? Weren’t they all part of the same army?\nThe cracks. He couldn’t let them get wider. If he was going to be with\nNavani, he had to prove to himself he could remain firm in the other areas.\n“No,” he said. “I will attack, but only after you’ve made a landing point for\nmy bridge crews. Even that is more than I should allow. Never force your\nmen to do as you yourself would not.”\n“You do charge the Parshendi!”\n“I’d never do it carrying one of those bridges,” Dalinar said. “I’m\nsorry, old friend. It’s not a judgment of you. It is what I must do.”\nSadeas shook his head, pulling on his helmet. “Well, it will have to do.\nWe still planning on dining together tonight to discuss strategy?”\n“I assume so. Unless Elhokar has a fit for both of us missing his feast.”\nSadeas snorted. “He’s going to have to grow accustomed to it. Six"

        "text": "“I assume so. Unless Elhokar has a fit for both of us missing his feast.”\nSadeas snorted. “He’s going to have to grow accustomed to it. Six\nyears of feasting every night is growing tedious. Besides, I doubt he’ll feel\nanything but elation after we win this day and leave the Parshendi down a\nfull third of their soldiers. See you on the battlefield.”\nDalinar nodded and Sadeas jumped off the rock formation, dropping\ndown to the surface below and joining his officers. Dalinar lingered,\nlooking over at the Tower. It was not only larger than most plateaus, it was\nrougher, covered with lumpish rock formations of hardened crem. The\npatterns were rolling and smooth, yet very uneven—like a field full of short\nwalls covered by a blanket of snow.\nThe southeastern tip of the plateau rose to a point overlooking the\nPlains. The two plateaus they’d use were on the middle of the west side;\nSadeas would take the northern one and Dalinar would assault from one just\nbelow it, once Sadeas had cleared a landing for him.\nWe need to push the Parshendi to the southeast, Dalinar thought,\nrubbing his chin, corner them there. Everything hinged on that. The\nchrysalis was up near the top, so the Parshendi were already situated in a\ngood position for Dalinar and Sadeas to push them back against the cliff\nedge. The Parshendi would probably allow this, as it would give them the\nhigh ground.\nIf a second Parshendi army came, it would be separated from the\nothers. The Alethi could focus on the Parshendi trapped atop the Tower\nwhile holding a defensive formation against the new arrivals. It would\nwork.\nHe felt himself growing excited. He hopped down to a shorter\noutcropping, then walked down a few steplike clefts to reach the plateau\nfloor, where his officers waited. He then rounded the rock formation,\ninvestigating Adolin’s progress. The young man stood in his Shardplate,\ndirecting the companies as they crossed Sadeas’s mobile bridges onto the\nsouthern staging plateau. In the near distance, Sadeas’s men were forming\nup for the assault.\nThat group of armored bridgemen stood out, preparing at the front\ncenter of the formation of bridge crews. Why were they allowed armor?\nWhy not the others as well? It looked like Parshendi carapace. Dalinar\nshook his head. The assault began, bridge crews running out ahead of\nSadeas’s army, approaching the Tower first.\n“Where would you like to make our assault, Father?” Adolin asked,\nsummoning his Shardblade and resting it on his pauldron, sharp side up.\n“There,” Dalinar said, pointing to a spot on their staging plateau. “Get\nthe men ready.”\nAdolin nodded, shouting the orders.\nIn the distance, bridgemen began to die. Heralds guide your paths, you\npoor men, Dalinar thought. As well as my own.\nKaladin danced with the wind.\nArrows streamed around him, passing close, nearly kissing him with\ntheir painted scragglebark fletching. He had to let them get close, had to\nmake the Parshendi feel they were near to killing him."

He had to let them get close, had to\nmake the Parshendi feel they were near to killing him.\nDespite four other bridgemen drawing their attention, despite the other\nmen of Bridge Four behind armored with the skeletons of fallen Parshendi,\nmost of the archers focused on Kaladin. He was a symbol. A living banner\nto destroy.\nKaladin spun between arrows, slapping them away with his shield. A\nstorm raged inside him, as if his blood had been sucked away and replaced\nwith stormwinds. It made his fingertips tingle with energy. Ahead, the\nParshendi sang their angry, chanting song. The song for one who\nblasphemed against their dead.\nKaladin stayed at the front of the decoys, letting the arrows fall close.\nDaring them. Taunting them. Demanding they kill him until the arrows\nstopped falling and the wind stilled.\nKaladin came to rest, breath held to contain the storm within. The\nParshendi reluctantly fell back before Sadeas’s force. An enormous force, as\nfar as plateau assaults went. Thousands of men and thirty-two bridges.\nDespite Kaladin’s distraction, five bridges had been dropped, the men\ncarrying them slaughtered.\nNone of the soldiers rushing across the chasm had made any specific\neff ort to attack the archers firing on Kaladin, but the weight of numbers had\nforced them away. A few gave Kaladin loathing gazes, making an odd\ngesture by cupping a hand to the right ear and pointing at him before finally\nretreating.\nKaladin released his breath, Stormlight pulsing away from him. He\nhad to walk a very fine line, drawing in enough Stormlight to stay alive, but\nnot so much that it was visible to the watching soldiers.\nThe Tower rose ahead of him, a slab of stone that dipped toward the\nwest. The chasm was so wide that he’d worried the men would drop the\nbridge into the chasm as they tried to place it. On the other side, Sadeas had\narrayed his forces in a cupping shape, pushing the Parshendi back away,\ntrying to give Dalinar an opening.\nPerhaps attacking this way served to protect Dalinar’s pristine image.\nHe wouldn’t make bridgemen die. Not directly, at least. Never mind that he\nstood on the backs of the men who had fallen to get Sadeas across. Their\ncorpses were his true bridge.\n“Kaladin!” a voice called from behind.\nKaladin spun. One of his men was wounded. Storm it! he thought,\ndashing up to Bridge Four. There was enough Stormlight still pulsing in his\nveins to stave off exhaustion. He’d grown complacent. Six bridge runs\nwithout a casualty. He should have realized it couldn’t last. He pushed\nthrough the collected bridgemen to find Skar on the ground, holding his\nfoot, red blood seeping between his fingers.\n“Arrow in the foot,” Skar said through gritted teeth. “In the storming\nfoot! Who gets hit in the foot?”\n“Kaladin!” Moash’s voice said, urgent. The bridgemen split as Moash\nbrought Teft in, an arrow sprouting from his shoulder between carapace\nbreastplate and arm."

The bridgemen split as Moash\nbrought Teft in, an arrow sprouting from his shoulder between carapace\nbreastplate and arm.\n“Storm it!” Kaladin said, helping Moash set Teft down. The older\nbridgeman looked dazed. The arrow had dug deep into the muscle.\n“Somebody get pressure on Skar’s foot and wrap it until I can look at it.\nTeft, can you hear me?”\n“I’m sorry, lad,” Teft mumbled, eyes glassy. “I’m…”\n“You’re all right,” Kaladin said, hurriedly taking some bandages from\nLopen, then nodding grimly. Lopen would heat a knife for cauterizing.\n“Who else?”\n“Everyone else is accounted for,” Drehy said. “Teft was trying to hide\nhis wound. He must have taken it when we were shoving the bridge across.”\nKaladin pressed gauze against the wound, then gestured for Lopen to\nhurry with the heated knife. “I want our scouts watching. Make sure the\nParshendi don’t try a stunt like they did a few weeks back! If they jump\nacross that plateau to get at Bridge Four, we’re dead.”\n“Is all right,” Rock said, shading his eyes. “Sadeas is keeping his men\nin this area. No Parshendi will get through.”\nThe knife came, and Kaladin held it hesitantly, a curl of smoke rising\nfrom its length. Teft had lost too much blood; there was no risking a sewing.\nBut with the twist of the knife, Kaladin risked some bad scarring. That\ncould leave the aging bridgeman with a stiff ness that would hurt his ability\nto wield a spear.\nReluctantly, Kaladin pressed the knife into the wound, the flesh hissing\nand blood drying to black crisps. Painspren wiggled out of the ground,\nsinewy and orange. In a surgery, you could sew. But on the field, this was\noften the only way.\n“I’m sorry, Teft.” He shook his head as he continued to work.\nMen began to scream. Arrows hit wood and flesh, sounding like distant\nwoodsmen swinging axes.\nDalinar waited beside his men, watching Sadeas’s soldiers fight. He\nhad better give us an opening, he thought. I’m starting to hunger for this\nplateau.\nFortunately, Sadeas quickly gained his footing on the Tower and sent a\nflanking force over to carve out a section of land for Dalinar. They didn’t\nget entirely into place before Dalinar started moving.\n“One of you bridges, come with me!” he bellowed, barreling to the\nforefront. He was followed by one of the eight bridge teams Sadeas had lent\nhim.\nDalinar needed to get onto that plateau. The Parshendi had noticed\nwhat was happening and had begun to put pressure on the small company in\ngreen and white that Sadeas had sent to defend his entry area. “Bridge crew,\nthere!” Dalinar said, pointing.\nThe bridgemen hustled into place, looking relieved that they wouldn’t\nbe asked to place their bridge under fire of arrows.

As soon as they got it\ninto position, Dalinar charged across, the Cobalt Guard following. Just\nahead, Sadeas’s men broke.\nDalinar bellowed, closing his gauntleted hands around Oathbringer’s\nhilt as the sword formed from mist. He crashed into the surging Parshendi\nline with a wide, two-handed sweep that dropped four men. The Parshendi\nbegan to chant in their strange language, singing their war song. Dalinar\nkicked a corpse aside and began to attack in earnest, frantically defending\nthe foothold Sadeas’s men had gained him. Within minutes, his soldiers\nsurged around him.\nWith the Cobalt Guard watching his back, Dalinar waded into the\nbattle, breaking enemy ranks as only a Shardbearer could. He tore pockets\nthrough the Parshendi front lines, like a fish leaping from a stream, cutting\nback and forth, keeping his enemies disorganized. Corpses with burned eyes\nand slashed clothing made a trail behind him. More and more Alethi troops\nfilled in the holes. Adolin crashed through a group of Parshendi nearby, his\nown squad of Cobalt Guardsmen a safe distance behind. He brought his\nwhole army across—he needed to ascend quickly, pinning the Parshendi\nback so they couldn’t escape. Sadeas was to watch the northern and western\nedges of the Tower.\nThe rhythm of the battle sang to Dalinar. The Parshendi chanting, the\nsoldiers grunting and yelling, the Shardblade in his hands and the surging\npower of the Plate. The Thrill rose within him. Since the nausea didn’t\nstrike him, he carefully let the Blackthorn free, and felt the joy of\ndominating a battlefield and the disappointment at lacking a worthy foe.\nWhere were the Parshendi Shardbearers? He had seen that one in battle\nweeks ago. Why had he not reappeared? Would they commit so many men\nto the Tower without sending a Shardbearer?\nSomething heavy hit his armor, banging off it, causing a small puff of\nStormlight to escape between the joints along his upper arm. Dalinar\ncursed, raising an arm to protect his face while scanning the near distance.\nThere, he thought, picking out a nearby rock formation where a group of\nParshendi stood swinging enormous rock slings with two hands. The head-\nsize stones crashed into Parshendi and Alethi alike, though Dalinar was\nobviously the target.\nHe growled as another one hit, smashing against his forearm, sending a\nsoft jolt through the Shardplate. The blow was strong enough to send a\nsmall array of cracks through his right vambrace.\nDalinar growled and threw himself into a Plate-enhanced run. The\nThrill surged more strongly through him, and he rammed his shoulder into a\ngroup of Parshendi, scattering them, then spun with his Blade and cut down\nthose too slow to get out of his way. He dodged to the side as a hail of\nstones fell where he’d been standing, then leaped onto a low boulder. He\ntook two steps and jumped for the ledge where the rock-throwers were\nstanding.\nHe grabbed its edge with one hand, holding his Blade with the other."

Oathbringer cut at their legs, and four men\ntumbled to the ground, feet dead. Dalinar dropped the Blade—it vanished—\nand used both hands to heave himself onto the ridge.\nHe landed in a crouch, Plate clanking. Several of the remaining\nParshendi tried to swing their slings, but Dalinar grabbed a pair of head-size\nstones from a pile—easily palming them in his gauntleted hands—and flung\nthem at the Parshendi. The stones hit with enough force to toss the slingmen\noff the formation, crushing their chests.\nDalinar smiled, then began throwing more stones. As the last\nParshendi fell off the ledge, Dalinar spun, summoning Oathbringer and\nlooking over the battlefield. A spear wall of blue and reflective steel\nstruggled against black and red Parshendi. Dalinar’s men did well, pressing\nthe Parshendi up to the southeast, where they would be trapped. Adolin led\nthis eff ort, Shardplate gleaming.\nBreathing deeply from the Thrill now, Dalinar held his Shardblade up\nabove his head, reflecting sunlight. Below, his men cheered, sending up\ncalls that rose above the Parshendi war chant. Gloryspren sprouted around\nhim.\nStormfather, but it felt good to be winning again. He threw himself off\nthe rock formation, for once not taking the slow and careful way down. He\nfell amid a group of Parshendi, crashing to the stones, blue Stormlight\nrising from his armor. He spun, slaying, remembering years spent fighting\nalongside Gavilar. Winning, conquering.\nHe and Gavilar had created something during those years. A solidified,\ncohesive nation out of something fractured. Like master potters\nreconstructing a fine ceramic that had been dropped. With a roar, Dalinar\ncut through the line of Parshendi, to where the Cobalt Guard was fighting to\ncatch up to him. “We press them!” he bellowed. “Pass the word! All\ncompanies up the side of the Tower!”\nSoldiers raised spears and runners went to deliver his orders. Dalinar\nspun and charged into the Parshendi, pushing himself—and his army—\nforward. To the north, Sadeas’s forces were stalled. Well, Dalinar’s force\nwould do the work for him. If Dalinar could spear forward here, he could\nslice the Parshendi in half, then crush the northern side against Sadeas and\nthe southern side against the cliff edge.\nHis army surged forward behind him, and the Thrill bubbled within. It\nwas power. Strength greater than Shardplate. Vitality greater than youth.\nSkill greater than a lifetime of practice. A fever of power. Parshendi after\nParshendi fell before his Blade. He couldn’t cut their flesh, yet he sheared\nthrough their ranks. The momentum of their attacks often carried their\ncorpses stumbling past him even as their eyes burned. The Parshendi started\nto break, running away or falling back. He grinned behind his near-\ntranslucent visor."

This was control. Gavilar had been the leader, the\nmomentum, and the essence of their conquest. But Dalinar had been the\nwarrior. Their opponents had surrendered to Gavilar’s rule, but the\nBlackthorn—he was the man who had scattered them, the one who had\ndueled their leaders and slain their best Shardbearers.\nDalinar screamed at the Parshendi, and their entire line bent, then\nshattered. The Alethi surged forward, cheering. Dalinar joined his men,\ncharging at their forefront to run down the fleeing Parshendi warpairs as\nthey fled to the north or south, trying to join larger groups who held there.\nHe reached a pair. One turned to hold him off with a hammer, but\nDalinar cut him down in passing, then grabbed the other Parshendi and\nthrew him down with a twist of the arm. Grinning, Dalinar raised his Blade\nhigh over his head, looming over the soldier.\nThe Parshendi rolled awkwardly, holding his arm, no doubt shattered\nas he was thrown down. He looked up at Dalinar, terrified, fearspren\nappearing around him.\nHe was only a youth.\nDalinar froze, Blade held above his head, muscles taut. Those eyes…\nthat face… Parshendi might not be human, but their features—their\nexpressions—were the same. Save for the marbled skin and the strange\ngrowths of carapace armor, this boy could have been a groom in Dalinar’s\nstable. What did he see above him? A faceless monster in impervious\narmor? What was this youth’s story? He would only have been a boy when\nGavilar had been assassinated.\nDalinar stumbled backward, the Thrill vanishing. One of the Cobalt\nGuardsmen passed by, casually ramming a sword into the Parshendi boy’s\nneck. Dalinar raised a hand, but it was over too quickly for him to stop. The\nsoldier didn’t notice Dalinar’s gesture.\nDalinar lowered his hand. His men were rushing around him, rolling\nover the fleeing Parshendi. The majority of the Parshendi still fought,\nresisting Sadeas on one side and Dalinar’s force on the other. The eastern\nplateau edge was just a short distance to Dalinar’s right—he had come up\nagainst the Parshendi force like a spear, slicing it through the center,\nsplitting it off to the north and south.\nAround him lay the dead. Many of them had fallen face-down, taken in\nthe back by spears or arrows from Dalinar’s forces. Some Parshendi were\nstill alive, though dying. They hummed or whispered to themselves a\nstrange, haunting song. The one they sang as they waited to die.\nTheir whispered songs rose like the curses of spirits on Soul’s March.\nDalinar had always found the death song the most beautiful of all he had\nheard from the Parshendi. It seemed to cut through the grunts, clangs, and\nscreams of the nearby battle. As always, each Parshendi’s song was in\nperfect time with that of his fellows. It was as if they could all hear the"

Never\nask of your men a sacrifice you wouldn’t make yourself. Never make them\nfight in conditions you would refuse to fight in yourself. Never ask a man to\nperform an act you wouldn’t soil your own hands doing.\nHe felt sick. This wasn’t beautiful. This wasn’t glorious. This wasn’t\nstrength, power, or life. This was revolting, repellent, and ghastly.\nBut they killed Gavilar! he thought, searching for a way to overcome\nthe sickness he suddenly felt.\nUnite them….\nRoshar had been united, once. Had that included the Parshendi?\nYou don’t know if you can trust the visions or not, he told himself, his\nhonor guard forming up behind him. They could be from the Nightwatcher\nor the Voidbringers. Or something else entirely.\nIn that moment, the objections felt weak. What had the visions wanted\nhim to do? Bring peace to Alethkar, unite his people, act with justice and\nhonor. Could he not judge the visions based on those results?\nHe raised his Shardblade to his shoulder, walking solemnly among the\nfallen toward the northern line, where the Parshendi were trapped between\nhis men and Sadeas’s. His sickness grew stronger.\nWhat was happening to him?\n“Father!” Adolin’s shout was frantic.\nDalinar turned toward his son, who was running to him. The young\nman’s Plate was sprayed with Parshendi blood, but as always his Blade\ngleamed.\n“What do we do?” Adolin asked, panting.\n“About what?” Dalinar asked.\nAdolin turned, pointing to the west—toward the plateau south of the\none from which Dalinar’s army had begun their assault over an hour ago.\nThere, leaping across the wide chasm, was an enormous second army of\nParshendi.\nDalinar slammed his visor up, fresh air washing across his sweaty face.\nHe stepped forward. He’d anticipated this possibility, but someone should\nhave given warning. Where were the scouts? What was—\nHe felt a chill.\nShaking, he scrambled toward one of the smooth, bulging formations\nof rock that were plentiful on the Tower.\n“Father?” Adolin said, running after him.\nDalinar climbed, seeking the top of the formation, dropping his\nShardblade. He crested the rise and stood looking northward over his troops\nand the Parshendi. Northward, toward Sadeas. Adolin climbed up beside\nhim, gauntleted hand slapping up his visor.\n“Oh no…” he whispered.\nSadeas’s army was retreating across the chasm to the northern staging\nplateau. Half of it was across already. The eight groups of bridgemen he’d\nlent Dalinar had pulled back and were gone.\nSadeas was abandoning Dalinar and his troops, leaving them\nsurrounded on three sides by Parshendi, alone on the Shattered Plains. And\nhe was taking all of his bridges with him."

A middle-aged potter.\nReported seeing strange dreams during highstorms during the last two\nyears.\nKaladin wearily unwrapped Skar’s wound to inspect his stitches and change\nthe bandage. The arrow had hit on the right side of the ankle, deflecting off\nthe knob of the fibula and scraping down through the muscles on the side of\nthe foot.\n“You were very lucky, Skar,” Kaladin said, putting on the new\nbandage. “You’ll walk on this again, assuming you do not put weight on it\nuntil it’s healed. We’ll have some of the men carry you back to camp.”\nBehind them, the screaming, pounding, pulsing battle raged on. The\nfighting was distant now, focused on the eastern edge of the plateau. To\nKaladin’s right, Teft drank as Lopen poured water into his mouth. The older\nman scowled, taking the waterskin from Lopen with his good hand. “I’m\nnot an invalid,” he snapped. He’d gotten over his initial dizziness, though\nhe was weak.\nKaladin sat back, feeling drained. When Stormlight faded away, it left\nhim exhausted. That should pass soon; it had been over an hour since the\ninitial assault. He carried a few more infused spheres in his pouch; he\nforced himself to resist the urge to suck in their Light.\nHe stood up, meaning to gather some men to carry Moash and Teft\ntoward the far side of the plateau, just in case the battle went poorly and\nthey had to retreat. That wasn’t likely; the Alethi soldiers had been doing\nwell the last time he’d checked.\nHe scanned the battlefield again. What he saw made him freeze.\nSadeas was retreating.\nAt first, it seemed so impossible that Kaladin couldn’t accept it. Was\nSadeas bringing his men around to attack in another direction? But no, the\nrear guard was already across the bridges, and Sadeas’s banner was\napproaching. Was the highprince wounded?\n“Drehy, Leyten, grab Skar. Rock and Peet, you take Teft. Hustle to the\nwestern side of the plateau in preparation to flee. The rest of you, get into\nbridge positions.”\nThe men, only now noticing what was going on, responded with\nanxiety.\n“Moash, you’re with me,” Kaladin said, hastening toward their bridge.\nMoash hurried up beside Kaladin. “What’s going on?”\n“Sadeas is pulling out,” Kaladin said, watching the tide of Sadeas’s\nmen in green slide away from the Parshendi lines like wax melting.\n“There’s no reason to. The battle’s barely begun, and his forces were\nwinning. I can only think that Sadeas must have been wounded.”\n“Why would they withdraw the entire army for that?” Moash said.\n“You don’t think he is…”\n“His banner still flies,” Kaladin said. “So he’s probably not dead.\nUnless they left it up to keep the men from panicking.”"

Behind, the rest of the\ncrew hastened to form a line. Matal was on the other side of the chasm,\nspeaking with the commander of the rear guard. After a quick exchange,\nMatal crossed and began to run down the line of bridge crews, calling for\nthem to prepare to carry. He glanced at Kaladin’s team, but saw they were\nalready ready, and so hurried on.\nTo Kaladin’s right, on the adjacent plateau—the one where Dalinar had\nlaunched his assault—the eight lent bridge crews pulled away from the\nbattlefield, crossing over to Kaladin’s plateau. A lighteyed officer Kaladin\ndidn’t recognize was giving them orders. Beyond them, farther to the\nsouthwest, a new Parshendi force had arrived, and was pouring onto the\nTower.\nSadeas rode up to the chasm. The paint on his Shardplate gleamed in\nthe sun; it didn’t bear a single scratch. In fact, his entire honor guard was\nunharmed. Though they had gone over to the Tower, they had disengaged\nthe enemy and come back. Why?\nAnd then Kaladin saw it. Dalinar Kholin’s force, fighting on the upper\nmiddle slope of the wedge, was now surrounded. This new Parshendi force\nwas flooding into sections that Sadeas had held, supposedly protecting\nDalinar’s retreat.\n“They’re abandoning him!” Kaladin said. “This was a trap. A setup.\nSadeas is leaving Highprince Kholin—and all of his soldiers—to die.”\nKaladin scrambled around the end of the bridge, pushing through the\nsoldiers who were coming off it. Moash cursed and followed.\nKaladin wasn’t certain why he elbowed his way up to the next bridge\n— bridge ten—where Sadeas was crossing. Perhaps he needed to see for\ncertain that Sadeas wasn’t wounded. Perhaps he was still stunned. This was\ntreachery on a grand scale, terrible enough that it made Amaram’s betrayal\nof Kaladin seem almost trivial.\nSadeas trotted his horse across the bridge, the wood clattering. He was\naccompanied by two lighteyed men in regular armor, and all three had their\nhelms under their arms, as if they were on parade.\nThe honor guard stopped Kaladin, looking hostile. He was still close\nenough to see that Sadeas was, indeed, completely unharmed. He was also\nclose enough to study Sadeas’s proud face as he turned his horse and looked\nback at the Tower. The second Parshendi army swarmed Kholin’s army,\ntrapping them. Even without that, Kholin had no bridges. He could not\nretreat.\n“I told you, old friend,” Sadeas said, voice soft but distinct,\noverlapping the distant screams. “I said that honor of yours would get you\nkilled someday.” He shook his head.\nThen he turned his horse, trotting it away from the battlefield.\nDalinar cut down a Parshendi warpair.

He set his jaw, falling into Windstance and taking the defensive, holding\nhis little rise in the hillside and acting as a rock over which the oncoming\nParshendi wave would have to break.\nSadeas had planned this retreat well. His men hadn’t been having\ntrouble; they’d been ordered to fight in a way that they could easily\ndisengage. And he had a full forty bridges to retreat across. Together, that\nmade his abandonment of Dalinar happen quickly, by the scale of battles.\nThough Dalinar had immediately ordered his men to push forward, hoping\nto catch Sadeas while the bridges were still set, he hadn’t been nearly quick\nenough. Sadeas’s bridges were pulling away, the entirety of his army now\nacross.\nAdolin fought nearby. They were two tired men in Plate facing an\nentire army. Their armor had accumulated a frightening number of cracks.\nNone were critical yet, but they did leak precious Stormlight. Wisps of it\nrose like the songs of dying Parshendi.\n“I warned you not to trust him!” Adolin bellowed as he fought, cutting\ndown a pair of Parshendi, then taking a wave of arrows from a team of\narchers who had set up nearby. The arrows sprayed against Adolin’s armor,\nscratching the paint. One caught in a crack, widening it.\n“I told you,” Adolin continued to yell, lowering his arm from his face\nand slicing into the next pair of Parshendi just before they landed their\nhammers on him. “I said he was an eel!”\n“I know!” Dalinar yelled back.\n“We walked right into this,” Adolin continued, shouting as if he hadn’t\nheard Dalinar. “We let him take away our bridges. We let him get us onto\nthe plateau before the second wave of Parshendi arrived. We let him control\nthe scouts. We even suggested the attack pattern that would leave us\nsurrounded if he didn’t support us!”\n“I know.” Dalinar’s heart twisted inside of him.\nSadeas was carrying out a premeditated, carefully planned, and very\nthorough betrayal. Sadeas hadn’t been overwhelmed, hadn’t retreated for\nsafety—though that was undoubtedly what he would claim when he got\nback to camp. A disaster, he’d say. Parshendi everywhere. Attacking\ntogether had upset the balance, and—unfortunately—he’d been forced to\npull out and leave his friend. Oh, perhaps some of Sadeas’s men would talk,\ntell the truth, and other highprinces would undoubtedly know what really\nhappened. But nobody would challenge Sadeas openly. Not after such a\ndecisive and powerful maneuver.\nThe people in the warcamps would go along with it. The other\nhighprinces were too displeased with Dalinar to raise a fuss. The only one\nwho might speak up was Elhokar, and Sadeas had his ear. It wrenched\nDalinar’s heart. Had it all been an act? Could he really have misjudged\nSadeas so completely?

Sadeas, watching Dalinar\nfighting for his life. That figure paused for a moment, then turned around\nand rode on.\nThe Parshendi were surrounding the forward position where Dalinar\nand Adolin fought just ahead of the army. They were overwhelming his\nguard. He jumped down and slew another pair of enemies, but earned\nanother blow to his forearm in the process. The Parshendi swarmed around\nhim, and Dalinar’s guard began to buckle.\n“Pull away!” he yelled at Adolin, then began to back toward the army\nproper.\nThe youth cursed, but did as ordered. Dalinar and Adolin retreated\nback behind the front line of defense. Dalinar pulled off his cracked helm,\npanting. He’d been fighting nonstop long enough to get winded, despite his\nShardplate. He let one of the guardsmen hand him a waterskin, and Adolin\ndid the same. Dalinar squirted the warm water into his mouth and across his\nface. It had the metallic taste of stormwater.\nAdolin lowered his waterskin, swishing the water in his mouth. He met\nDalinar’s eyes, his face haunted and grim. He knew. Just as Dalinar did.\nJust as the men likely did. There would be no surviving this battle. The\nParshendi left no survivors. Dalinar braced himself, waiting for further\naccusations from Adolin. The boy had been right all along. And whatever\nthe visions were, they had misled Dalinar in at least one respect. Trusting\nSadeas had brought them to doom.\nMen died just a short distance away, screaming and cursing. Dalinar\nlonged to fight, but he needed to rest himself. Losing a Shardbearer because\nof fatigue would not serve his men.\n“Well?” Dalinar demanded of Adolin. “Say it. I have led us to\ndestruction.”\n“I—”\n“This is my fault,” Dalinar said. “I should never have risked our house\nfor those foolish dreams.”\n“No,” Adolin said. He sounded surprised at himself for saying it. “No,\nFather. It’s not your fault.”\nDalinar stared at his son. That was not what he’d expected to hear.\n“What would you have done differently?” Adolin asked. “Would you\nstop trying to make something better of Alethkar?

I wish to the Heralds that we hadn’t let\nSadeas trick us into this, but I will not blame you for his deceit.”\nAdolin reached over, gripping Dalinar’s Plate-covered arm. “You are\nright to follow the Codes. You were right to try to unite Alethkar. And I was\na fool for fighting you on it every step along the path.

Would he have become the same pitiless killer he’d been as a\nyouth?\nNo.\nDid it matter that the visions had been wrong about Sadeas? Was he\nashamed of the man that they, and the readings from the book, had made\nhim become? The final piece fell into place inside of him, the final\ncornerstone, and he found that he was no longer worried. The confusion\nwas gone. He knew what to do, at long last. No more questions. No more\nuncertainty.\nHe reached up, gripping Adolin’s arm. “Thank you.”\nAdolin nodded curtly. He was still angry, Dalinar could see, but he\nchose to follow Dalinar—and part of following a leader was supporting him\neven when the battle turned against him.\nThen they released one another and Dalinar turned to the soldiers\naround them. “It is time for us to fight,” he said, voice growing louder.\n“And we do so not because we seek the glory of men, but because the other\noptions are worse. We follow the Codes not because they bring gain, but\nbecause we loathe the people we would otherwise become. We stand here\non this battlefield alone because of who we are.”\nThe members of the Cobalt Guard standing in a ring began to turn, one\nat a time, looking toward him. Beyond them, reserve soldiers—lighteyed\nand dark—gathered closer, eyes terrified, but faces resolute.\n“Death is the end of all men!” Dalinar bellowed. “What is the measure\nof him once he is gone? The wealth he accumulated and left for his heirs to\nsquabble over? The glory he obtained, only to be passed on to those who\nslew him? The lofty positions he held through happenstance?\n“No. We fight here because we understand. The end is the same. It is\nthe path that separates men. When we taste that end, we will do so with our\nheads held high, eyes to the sun.”\nHe held out a hand, summoning Oathbringer. “I am not ashamed of\nwhat I have become,” he shouted, and found it to be true. It felt so strange\nto be free of guilt. “Other men may debase themselves to destroy me. Let\nthem have their glory. For I will retain mine!”\nThe Shardblade formed, dropping into his hand.\nThe men did not cheer, but they did stand taller, straight-backed. A\nlittle of the terror retreated. Adolin shoved his helm on, his own Blade\nappearing in his hand, coated in condensation. He nodded.\nTogether they charged back into the battle.\nAnd so I die, Dalinar thought, crashing into the Parshendi ranks. There"

There\nhe found peace. An unexpected emotion on the field of battle, but all the\nmore welcome for that.\nHe did, however, discover one regret: He was leaving poor Renarin as\nKholin highprince, in over his head and surrounded by enemies grown fat\non the flesh of his father and brother.\nI never did deliver that Shardplate I promised him, Dalinar thought. He\nwill have to make his way without it. Honor of our ancestors protect you,\nson.\nStay strong—and learn wisdom more quickly than your father did.\nFarewell.\n“Let me no longer hurt!

Note similarity to sample 1172-89.\nBridge Four lagged behind the rest of the army. With two wounded and four\nmen needed to carry them, the bridge weighed them down. Fortunately,\nSadeas had brought nearly every bridge crew on this run, including eight to\nlend to Dalinar. That meant the army didn’t need to wait for Kaladin’s team\nin order to cross.\nExhaustion saturated Kaladin, and the bridge on his shoulders seemed\nmade of stone. He hadn’t felt so tired since his first days as a bridgeman.\nSyl hovered in front of him, watching with concern as he marched at the\nhead of his men, sweat drenching the sides of his face, struggling over the\nuneven ground of the plateau.\nAhead, the last of Sadeas’s army was bunched along the chasm,\ncrossing. The staging plateau was nearly empty. The sheer awful audacity of\nwhat Sadeas had done twisted at Kaladin’s insides. He thought what had\nbeen done to him had been horrible. But here, Sadeas callously condemned\nthousands of men, lighteyed and dark. Supposed allies. That betrayal\nseemed to weigh as heavy on Kaladin as the bridge itself. It pressed on him,\nmade him gasp for breath.\nWas there no hope for men? They killed those they should have loved.\nWhat good was it to fight, what good was it to win, if there was no\ndifference between ally and enemy? What was victory? Meaningless. What\ndid the deaths of Kaladin’s friends and colleagues mean? Nothing. The\nentire world was a pustule, sickeningly green and infested with corruption.\nNumb, Kaladin and the others reached the chasm, though they were\ntoo late to help with the transfer. The men he’d sent ahead were there, Teft\nlooking grim, Skar leaning on a spear to support his wounded leg. A small\ngroup of dead spearmen lay nearby. Sadeas’s soldiers retrieved their\nwounded, when possible, but some died as they were helped along. They’d\nabandoned some of those here; Sadeas was obviously in a hurry to leave the\nscene.\nThe dead had been left with their equipment. Skar had probably gotten\nhis crutch there.

Some poor bridge crew would have to cross all the way\nback here at a later date to salvage from these, and from Dalinar’s fallen.\nThey set their bridge down, and Kaladin wiped his brow. “Don’t place\nthe bridge across the chasm,” he told the men. “We’ll wait until the last of\nthe soldiers have crossed, then carry it over on one of the other bridges.”\nMatal eyed Kaladin and his team, but didn’t order them to set their bridge.\nHe realized that by the time they got it into position, they’d have to pull it\nup again.\n“Isn’t that a sight?” Moash said, stepping up beside Kaladin, looking\nback.\nKaladin turned. The Tower rose behind them, sloped in their direction.\nKholin’s army was a circle of blue, trapped in the middle of the slope after\ntrying to push down and get to Sadeas before he left. The Parshendi were a\ndark swarm with specks of red from their marbled skins. They pressed at\nthe Alethi ring, compressing it.\n“Such a shame,” Drehy said from beside their bridge, sitting on its lip.\n“Makes me sick.”\nOther bridgemen nodded, and Kaladin was surprised to see the concern\nin their faces. Rock and Teft joined Kaladin and Moash, all wearing their\nParshendi-carapace armor. He was glad they’d left Shen back in the camp.\nHe’d have been catatonic at the sight of it all.\nTeft cradled his wounded arm. Rock raised a hand to shade his eyes\nand shook his head, looking eastward. “Is a shame. A shame to Sadeas. A\nshame to us.”\n“Bridge Four,” Matal called. “Come on!”\nMatal was waving for them to cross Bridge Six’s bridge and leave the\nstaging plateau. An idea came to Kaladin suddenly. A fantastic idea, like a\nblooming rockbud in his mind.\n“We’ll follow with our own bridge, Matal,” Kaladin called. “We only\njust got to the chasm. We need to sit for a few minutes.”\n“Cross now!” Matal yelled.\n“We’ll just fall further behind!” Kaladin retorted. “You want to explain\nto Sadeas why he has to hold the entire army for one miserable bridge\ncrew? We’ve got our bridge. Let my men rest. We’ll catch up to you later.”\n“And if those savages come after you?” Matal demanded.\nKaladin shrugged.\nMatal blinked, then seemed to realize how badly he wanted that to\nhappen. “Suit yourself,” he called, rushing across bridge six as the other\nbridges were pulled up. In seconds, Kaladin’s team was alone beside the\nchasm, the army retreating westward.\nKaladin smiled broadly. “I can’t believe it, after all that worrying…\nMen, we’re free!”\nThe others turned to him, confused.\n“We’ll follow in a short while,” Kaladin said eagerly, “and Matal will\nassume we’re coming. We fall farther and farther behind the army, until\nwe’re out of sight. Then we’ll turn north, use the bridge to cross the Plains.\nWe can escape northward, and everyone will just assume the Parshendi"

Then we’ll turn north, use the bridge to cross the Plains.\nWe can escape northward, and everyone will just assume the Parshendi\ncaught us and slaughtered us!”\nThe other bridgemen regarded him with wide eyes.\n“Supplies,” Teft said.\n“We have these spheres,” Kaladin said, pulling out his pouch. “A\nwealth of them, right here. We can take the armor and weapons from the\ndead over there and use those to defend ourselves from bandits. It will be\nhard, but we won’t be chased!”\nThe men were starting to grow excited. However, something gave\nKaladin pause. What of the wounded bridgemen back in the camp?\n“I’ll have to stay behind,” Kaladin said.\n“What?” Moash demanded.\n“Someone will need to,” Kaladin said. “For the good of our wounded\nin camp. We can’t abandon them. And if I stay behind, I can support the\nstory. Wound me and leave me on one of the plateaus. Sadeas is sure to\nsend scavengers back. I’ll tell them my crew was hunted down in\nretribution for desecrating the Parshendi corpses, our bridge tossed into the\nchasm. They’ll believe it; they’ve seen how the Parshendi hate us.”\nThe crew was all standing now, shooting glances at one another.\nUncomfortable glances.\n“We’re not leaving without you,” Sigzil said. Many of the others\nnodded.\n“I’ll follow,” Kaladin said. “We can’t leave those men behind.”\n“Kaladin, lad—” Teft began.\n“We can talk about me later,” Kaladin interrupted. “Maybe I’ll go with\nyou, then sneak back into camp later to rescue the wounded. For now, go\nsalvage from those bodies.”\nThey hesitated.\n“It’s an order, men!”\nThey moved, offering no further complaint, rushing to pilfer from the\ncorpses Sadeas had abandoned. That left Kaladin alone beside the bridge.\nHe was still unsettled. It wasn’t just the wounded back in camp. What\nwas it, then? This was a fantastic opportunity. The type he’d have\npractically killed to get during his years as a slave. The chance to vanish,\npresumed dead? The bridgemen wouldn’t have to fight. They were free.\nWhy, then, was he so anxious?\nKaladin turned to survey his men, and was shocked to see someone\nstanding beside him. A woman of translucent white light.\nIt was Syl, as he’d never seen her before, the size of a regular person,\nhands clasped in front of her, hair and dress streaming to the side in the\nwind. He’d had no idea she could make herself so large. She stared\neastward, her expression horrified, eyes wide and sorrowful. It was the face\nof a child watching a brutal murder that stole her innocence.\nKaladin turned and slowly looked in the direction she was staring.\nToward the Tower.\nToward Dalinar Kholin’s desperate army.\nThe sight of them twisted his heart. They fought so hopelessly.\nSurrounded. Abandoned. Left alone to die.\nWe have a bridge, Kaladin realized. If we could get it set… Most of the\nParshendi were focused on the Alethi army, with only a token reserve force"

        "text": "We have a bridge, Kaladin realized. If we could get it set… Most of the\nParshendi were focused on the Alethi army, with only a token reserve force\ndown at the base near the chasm. It was a small enough group that perhaps\nthe bridgemen could contain them.\nBut no. That was idiocy. There were thousands of Parshendi soldiers\nblocking Kholin’s path to the chasm. And how would the bridgemen set\ntheir bridge, with no archers to support them?\nSeveral of the bridgemen returned from their quick scavenge. Rock\njoined Kaladin, staring eastward, expression becoming grim. “This thing is\nterrible,” he said. “Can we not do something to help?”\nKaladin shook his head. “It would be suicide, Rock. We’d have to run\na full assault without an army to support us.”\n“Couldn’t we just go back a little of the way?” Skar asked. “Wait to\nsee if Kholin can cut his way down to us? If he does, then we could set our\nbridge.”\n“No,” Kaladin said. “If we stayed out of range, Kholin would assume\nus to be scouts left by Sadeas. We’ll have to charge the chasm. Otherwise\nhe’d never come down to meet us.”\nThat made the bridgemen pale.\n“Besides,” Kaladin added. “If we did somehow save some of those\nmen, they’d talk, and Sadeas would know we still live. He’d hunt us down\nand kill us. By going back, we’d throw away our chance at freedom.”\nThe other bridgemen nodded at that. The rest had gathered, carrying\nweapons. It was time to go. Kaladin tried to squelch the feeling of despair\ninside him. This Dalinar Kholin was probably just like the others. Like\nRoshone, like Sadeas, like any number of other lighteyes. Pretending virtue\nbut corrupted inside.\nBut he has thousands of darkeyed soldiers with him, a part of him\nthought. Men who don’t deserve this terrible fate. Men like my old spear\ncrew.\n“We owe them nothing,” Kaladin whispered. He thought could see\nDalinar Kholin’s banner, flying blue at the front of his army. “You got them\ninto this, Kholin. I won’t let my men die for you.” He turned his back on the\nTower.\nSyl still stood beside him, facing eastward. It made his very soul twist\nin knots to see that look of despair on her face. “Are windspren attracted to\nwind,” she asked softly, “or do they make it?”\n“I don’t know,” Kaladin said. “Does it matter?”\n“Perhaps not. You see, I’ve remembered what kind of spren I am.”\n“Is this the time for it, Syl?”\n“I bind things, Kaladin,” she said, turning and meeting his eyes. “I am\nhonorspren. Spirit of oaths. Of promises. And of nobility.”\nKaladin could faintly hear the sounds of the battle. Or was that just his\nmind, searching for something he knew to be there?\nCould he hear the men dying?\nCould he see the soldiers running away, scattering, leaving their\nwarlord alone?\nEveryone else fleeing. Kaladin kneeling over Dallet’s body."

Kaladin kneeling over Dallet’s body.\nA green-and-burgundy banner, flying alone on the field.\n“I’ve been here before!” Kaladin bellowed, turning back toward that\nblue banner.\nDalinar always fought at the front.\n“What happened last time?” Kaladin yelled. “I’ve learned! I won’t be a\nfool again!”\nIt seemed to crush him. Sadeas’s betrayal, his exhaustion, the deaths of\nso many. He was there again for a moment, kneeling in Amaram’s mobile\nheadquarters, watching the last of his friends being slaughtered, too weak\nand hurt to save them.\nHe raised a trembling hand to his head, feeling the brand there, wet\nwith his sweat. “I owe you nothing, Kholin.”\nAnd his father’s voice seemed to whisper a reply. Somebody has to\nstart, son. Somebody has to step forward and do what is right, because it is\nright. If nobody starts, then others cannot follow.\nDalinar had come to help Kaladin’s men, attacking those archers and\nsaving Bridge Four.\nThe lighteyes don’t care about life, Lirin had said. So I must. So we\nmust.\nSo you must….\nLife before death.\nI’ve failed so often. I’ve been knocked to the ground and trod upon.\nStrength before weakness.\nThis would be death I’d lead my friends to…\nJourney before destination.…death, and what is right.\n“We have to go back,” Kaladin said softly. “Storm it, we have to go\nback.”\nHe turned to the members of Bridge Four. One by one, they nodded.\nMen who had been the dregs of the army just months before—men who had\nonce cared for nothing but their own skins—took deep breaths, tossed away\nthoughts for their own safety, and nodded. They would follow him.\nKaladin looked up and sucked in a deep breath. Stormlight rushed into\nhim like a wave, as if he’d put his lips up to a highstorm and drawn it into\nhimself.\n“Bridge up!” he commanded.\nThe members of Bridge Four cheered their agreement, grabbing their\nbridge and hoisting it high. Kaladin pulled on a shield, grabbing the straps\nin his hand.\nThen he turned, raising it high. With a shout, he led his men in a\ncharge back toward that abandoned blue banner.\nDalinar’s Plate leaked Stormlight from dozens of small breaks; no major\npiece had escaped. Light rose above him like steam from a cauldron,\nlingering as Stormlight did, slowly diffusing.\nThe sun beat down upon him, baking him as he fought. He was so\ntired. It hadn’t been long since Sadeas’s betrayal, not as time was counted in\nbattles. But Dalinar had pushed himself hard, staying at the very front,\nfighting side by side with Adolin. His Plate had lost much Stormlight. It was\ngrowing heavier, and lent him less power with each swing. Soon it would\nweigh him down, slowing him so the Parshendi could swarm over him.\nHe’d killed many of them. So many. A frightening number, and he did\nit without the Thrill. He was hollow inside. Better that than pleasure."

They focused on Dalinar and\nAdolin; with Shardbearers on the front line, any breach would soon be\npatched by a man in gleaming armor and a deadly Blade. The Parshendi had\nto bring him and Adolin down first. They knew it. Dalinar knew it. Adolin\nknew it.\nStories spoke of battlefields where the Shardbearers were the last ones\nstanding, pulled down by their enemies after long, heroic fights. Completely\nunrealistic. If you killed the Shardbearers first, you could take their Blades\nand turn them against the enemy.\nHe swung again, muscles lagging with fatigue. Dying first. It was a\ngood place to be. Ask nothing of them you wouldn’t do yourself…. Dalinar\nstumbled on the rocks, his Shardplate feeling as heavy as regular armor.\nHe could be satisfied with the way he’d handled his own life. But his\nmen… he had failed them. Thinking of the way he had stupidly led then\ninto a trap, that sickened him.\nAnd then there was Navani.\nOf all the times to finally begin courting her, Dalinar thought. Six years\nwasted. A lifetime wasted. And now she’ll have to grieve again.\nThat thought made him raise his arms and steady his feet on the stone.\nHe fought off the Parshendi. Struggling on. For her. He would not let\nhimself fall while he still had strength.\nNearby, Adolin’s armor leaked as well. The youth was extending\nhimself more and more to protect his father. There had been no discussion\nof trying, perhaps, to leap the chasms and flee. With chasms so wide, the\nchances were slim—but beyond that, they would not abandon their men to\ndie. He and Adolin had lived by the Codes. They would die by the Codes.\nDalinar swung again, staying at Adolin’s side, fighting in that just-out-\nof-reach tandem way of two Shardbearers. Sweat streamed down his face\ninside his helm, and he shot a final glance toward the disappearing army. It\nwas just barely visible on the horizon. Dalinar’s current position gave him a\ngood view down to the west.\nLet that man be cursed for…\nFor…\nBlood of my fathers, what is that?\nA small force was moving across the western plateau, running toward\nthe Tower. A solitary bridge crew, carrying their bridge.\n“It can’t be,” Dalinar said, stepping back from the fighting, letting the\nCobalt Guard—what was left of them—rush in to defend him. Distrusting\nhis eyes, he pushed his visor up. The rest of Sadeas’s army was gone, but\nthis single bridge crew remained. Why?\n“Adolin!” he bellowed, pointing with his Shardblade, a surge of hope\nflooding his limbs.\nThe young man turned, tracing Dalinar’s gesture. Adolin froze.\n“Impossible!” he yelled. “What kind of trap is that?”\n“A foolish one, if it is a trap. We are already dead.”\n“But why would he send one back? What purpose?”\n“Does it matter?”"

Both knew the answer.\n“Assault formations!” Dalinar yelled, turning back to his troops.\nStormfather, there were so few of them left. Less than half of his original\neight thousand.\n“Form up,” Adolin called. “Get ready to move! We’re going to punch\nthrough them, men. Gather everything you’ve got. We’ve got one chance!”\nA slim one, Dalinar thought, pulling his visor down. We’ll have to cut\nthrough the rest of the Parshendi army. Even if they reached the bottom,\nthey’d probably find the crew dead, their bridge cast into the chasm. The\nParshendi archers were already forming up; there were more than a hundred\nof them. It would be a slaughter.\nBut it was a hope. A tiny, precious hope. If his army was going to fall,\nit would do so while trying to seize that hope.\nRaising his Shardblade high, feeling a surge of strength and\ndetermination, Dalinar charged forward at the head of his men.\nFor the second time in one day, Kaladin ran toward an armed Parshendi\nposition, shield before him, wearing armor cut from the corpse of a fallen\nenemy. Perhaps he should have felt revolted at what he’d done in creating\nhis armor. But it was no worse than what the Parshendi had done in killing\nDunny, Maps, and that nameless man who had shown Kaladin kindness on\nhis first day as a bridgemen. Kaladin still wore that man’s sandals.\nUs and them, he thought. That was the only way a soldier could think\nof it. For today, Dalinar Kholin and his men were part of the “us.”\nA group of Parshendi had seen the bridgemen approaching and was\nsetting up with bows. Fortunately, it appeared that Dalinar had seen\nKaladin’s band as well, for the army in blue was beginning to cut its way\ntoward rescue.\nIt wasn’t going to work. There were too many Parshendi, and Dalinar’s\nmen would be tired. It was another disaster. But for once, Kaladin charged\ninto it with eyes wide open.\nThis is my choice, he thought as the Parshendi archers formed up. It’s\nnot some angry god watching me, not some spren playing tricks, not some\ntwist of fate.\nIt’s me. I chose to follow Tien. I chose to charge the Shardbearer and\nsave Amaram. I chose to escape the slave pits. And now, I choose to try to\nrescue these men, though I know I will probably fail.\nThe Parshendi loosed their arrows, and Kaladin felt an exaltation.\nTiredness evaporated, fatigue fled. He wasn’t fighting for Sadeas. He wasn’t\nworking to line someone’s pockets. He was fighting to protect.\nThe arrows zipped at him and he swung his shield in an arc, spraying\nthem away.

He was—\nSomething was wrong.\nHe spun between two arrows, confused.\n“Kaladin!” Syl said, hovering nearby, back to her smaller form.\n“There!”\nShe pointed toward the other staging plateau, the one nearby that\nDalinar had used for his assault. A large contingent of Parshendi had\njumped across to that plateau and were kneeling down, raising bows.\nPointed not at him, but right at Bridge Four’s unshielded flank.\n“No!” Kaladin screamed, Stormlight escaping from his mouth in a\ncloud. He turned and ran back across the rocky plateau toward the bridge\ncrew. Arrows launched at him from behind. One took his backplate square\non, but skidded aside. Another hit his helm. He leaped over a rocky rift,\ndashing with all the speed his Stormlight could lend him.\nThe Parshendi at the side were drawing. There were at least fifty of\nthem. He was going to be too late. He was going to—\n“Bridge Four!” he bellowed. “Side carry right!”\nThey hadn’t practiced that maneuver in weeks, but their training was\nmanifest as they obeyed without question, dropping the bridge to their side\njust as the archers loosed. The flight of arrows hit the bridge’s deck,\nbristling across the wood. Kaladin let out a relieved breath, reaching the\nbridge team, who had slowed to carry the bridge on the side.\n“Kaladin!” Rock said, pointing.\nKaladin spun. The archers behind, on the Tower, were drawing for a\nlarge volley.\nThe bridge crew was exposed. The archers loosed.\nHe yelled again, screaming out, Stormlight infusing the air around him\nas he threw every bit of it he had into his shield. The scream echoed in his\nears; the Stormlight burst from him, his clothing freezing and cracking.\nArrows darkened the sky. Something hit him, an extended impact that\ntossed him backward into the bridgemen. He struck hard, grunting as the\nforce continued to push upon him.\nThe bridge ground to a halt, the men stopping.\nAll fell still.\nKaladin blinked, feeling completely drained. His body hurt, his arms\ntingled, his back ached. There was a sharp pain in his wrist. He groaned,\nopening his eyes, stumbling as Rock’s hands caught him from behind.\nA muted thump. The bridge being set down. Idiots! Kaladin thought.\nDon’t set it down…. Retreat….\nThe bridgemen crowded around him as he slipped to the ground,\noverwhelmed by having expended too much Stormlight. He blinked at what\nhe held before him, attached to his bleeding arm.\nHis shield was covered in arrows, dozens of them, some splitting the\nothers. The bones crossing the shield’s front had shattered; the wood was in\nsplinters. Some of the arrows had gone through and hit his forearm. That\nwas the pain."

The\nstraps were broken, and as he struggled to stand, the shield all but\ndisintegrated, falling to pieces, scattering dozens of broken arrows at his\nfeet. A few remained stuck in his arm, but he ignored the pain, looking\nacross at the Parshendi.\nThe groups of archers on both plateaus froze in stunned postures. The\nones in front began to call to one another in a language Kaladin didn’t\nunderstand. “Neshua Kadal!” They stood up.\nAnd then they fled.\n“What?” Kaladin said.\n“I don’t know,” Teft said, cradling his own wounded arm. “But we’re\ngetting you to safety.

On the Tower, Dalinar’s force was fighting its way through the\nParshendi toward the possible safety of the bridge crew. They must be\ntaking such heavy losses… Kaladin thought numbly.\nHe stumbled and fell to the ground; Teft and Lopen pulled Kaladin into\na sheltered hollow, joining Skar and Dabbid. Skar’s foot bandage reddened\nwith seeping blood, the spear he’d been using as a staff resting beside him.\nThought I told him… to stay off that foot….\n“We need spheres,” Teft said. “Skar?”\n“He asked for them this morning,” the lean man said. “Gave him\neverything I had. I think most of the men did the same.”\nTeft cursed softly, pulling the remaining arrows from Kaladin’s arm,\nthen wrapping it with bandages.\n“Is he going to be all right?” Skar asked.\n“I don’t know,” Teft said. “I don’t know anything. Kelek! I’m an idiot.\nKaladin. Lad, can you hear me?”\n“It’s… just shock…” Kaladin said.\n“You’re looking strange, gancho,” Lopen said nervously. “White.”\n“Your skin is ashen, lad,” Teft said. “It looks like you did something to\nyourself back there. I don’t know… I…” He cursed again, smacking his\nhand against the stone. “I should have listened. Idiot!”\nThey’d laid him on his side, and he could barely see the Tower.

They unstrapped their shields and hurriedly retrieved spears\nfrom the sacks of salvage tied at the bridge’s side. Then the men went to\ntheir positions pushing at the sides, preparing to slide the bridge across the\ngap.\nThe Parshendi teams didn’t have bows. They formed up to wait,\nweapons out. There were easily three times as many as there were\nbridgemen, and more were coming.\n“We’ve got to go help,” Skar said to Lopen and Teft.\nThe other two nodded, and all three—two wounded and one missing\nan arm—climbed to their feet. Kaladin tried to do likewise, but he fell back\ndown, legs too weak to hold him.\n“Stay, lad,” Teft said, smiling. “We’ll handle it just fine.” They\ngathered some spears from a stock Lopen had put in his litter, then hobbled\nout to join the bridge crew. Even Dabbid joined them. He hadn’t spoken\nsince being wounded on that first bridge run, so long ago.\nKaladin crawled up to the lip of the depression, watching them. Syl\nlanded on the stone beside him. “Storming fools,” Kaladin muttered.\n“Shouldn’t have followed me. Proud of them anyway.”\n“Kaladin…” Syl said.\n“Is there anything you can do?” He was so storming tired. “Something\nto make me stronger?”\nShe shook her head.\nA short distance ahead, the bridgemen began to push. The bridge’s\nwood scraped loudly as it crossed the rocks, moving out over the chasm\ntoward the waiting Parshendi. They began singing that harsh battle song,\nthe one they did whenever they saw Kaladin in his armor.\nThe Parshendi looked eager, angry, deadly. They wanted blood. They\nwould cut into the bridgemen and rip them apart, then drop the bridge—\nand their corpses—into the void beneath.\nIt’s happening again, Kaladin thought, dazed and overwhelmed. He\nfound himself curling up, drained and shaken. I can’t get to them. They’ll\ndie. Right before me. Tukks. Dead. Nelda. Dead. Goshel. Dead. Dallet.\nCenn. Maps. Dunny. Dead. Dead. Dead…\nTien.\nDead.\nLying huddled in a hollow in the rock. The sounds of battle ringing in\nthe distance. Death surrounding him.\nIn a moment, he was there again, on that most horrible of days.\nKaladin stumbled through the cursing, screaming, fighting chaos of war,\nclinging to his spear. He’d dropped his shield. He needed to find a shield\nsomewhere. Shouldn’t he have a shield?\nIt was his third real battle. He’d been in Amaram’s army only a few\nmonths, but already Hearthstone seemed a world away. He reached a\nhollow of rock and crouched down, pushing his back to it, breathing in and\nout, fingers slick on the spear’s shaft. He was shaking.\nHe’d never realized how idyllic his life had been.

Away from those screams, the cacophony of metal on\nmetal, metal on wood, metal on flesh. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying to\nblock it out.\nNo, he thought. Open your eyes. Don’t let them find you and kill you\nthat easily.\nHe forced his eyes open, then turned and peeked out over the\nbattlefield. It was a complete mess. They fought on a large hillside,\nthousands of men on either side, intermixing and killing. How could anyone\nkeep track of anything in this insanity?\nAmaram’s army—Kaladin’s army—was trying to hold the hilltop.\nAnother army, also Alethi, was trying to take it from them. That was all\nKaladin knew. The enemy seemed more numerous than his own army.\nHe’ll be safe, Kaladin thought. He will be!\nBut he had trouble convincing himself. Tien’s stint as a messenger boy\nhadn’t lasted long. Recruitment was down, he’d been told, and every hand\nthat could hold a spear was needed. Tien and the other older messenger\nboys had been organized into several squads of deep reserves.\nDalar said those wouldn’t ever be used. Probably. Unless the army was\nin serious danger. Did being surrounded atop a steep hill, their lines in\nchaos, constitute serious danger?\nGet to the top, he thought, looking up the incline. Amaram’s banner\nstill flew up there. Their soldiers must be holding. All Kaladin could see\nwas a churning mess of men in orange and the occasional bit of forest\ngreen.\nKaladin took off at a run up the side of the hill. He didn’t turn as men\nshouted at him, didn’t check to see which side they were from. Patches of\ngrass pulled down in front of him. He stumbled over a few corpses, dashed\naround a couple of scraggly stumpweight trees, and avoided places where\nmen were fighting.\nThere, he thought, noting a group of spearmen ahead, standing in a\nline, watching warily. Green. Amaram’s colors. Kaladin scrambled up to\nthem, and the soldiers let him pass.\n“Which squad are you from, soldier?” said a stocky lighteyed man\nwith the knots of a low captain.\n“Dead, sir,” Kaladin forced out. “All dead. We were in Brightlord\nTashlin’s company, and—”\n“Bah,” the man said, turning to a runner. “Third report we’ve had that\nTashlin is down. Somebody warn Amaram. East side is weakening by\ndegrees.” He looked to Kaladin. “You, off to the reserves for reassignment.”\n“Yes, sir,” Kaladin said, numb. He glanced down the way he’d come.\nThe incline was littered with corpses, many of them in green. Even as he\nwatched, a group of three stragglers rushing for the top was intercepted and\nslaughtered.\nNone of the men at the top moved to help them. Kaladin could have\nfallen just as easily, within yards of safety. He knew that it was probably\nimportant, strategically, that these soldiers in the line maintain their\npositions. But it seemed so heartless."

But it seemed so heartless.\nFind Tien, he thought, trotting off toward the reserves field on the\nnorth side of the wide hilltop. Here, however, he found only more chaos.\nGroups of dazed men, bloodied, getting sorted into new squads and sent\nback out onto the field. Kaladin moved through them, searching for the\nsquad that had been created out of the messenger boys.\nHe found Dalar first. The lanky, three-fingered sergeant of the reserves\nstood beside a tall post bearing a pair of flapping triangular banners. He was\nassigning newly made squads to fill out losses in the companies fighting\nbelow. Kaladin could still hear the yells.\n“You,” Dalar said, pointing at Kaladin. “Squad reassignment is in that\ndirection. Get moving!”\n“I need to find the squad made from messenger boys,” Kaladin said.\n“Why in Damnation do you want to know that?”\n“How should I know?” Kaladin said, shrugging, trying to remain calm.\n“I just follow orders.”\nDalar grunted. “Brightlord Sheler’s company. Southeast side. You can\n—”\nKaladin was already running. This wasn’t supposed to happen. Tien\nwas supposed to stay safe. Stormfather. It hadn’t even been four months yet!\nHe made his way to the southeast side of the hill and searched out a\nbanner flapping a quarter of the way down the incline. The stark black\nglyphpair read shesh lerel—Sheler’s company. Surprised at his own\ndetermination, Kaladin brushed past the soldiers guarding the hilltop and\nfound himself on the battlefield again.\nThings looked better over here. Sheler’s company was holding its\nground, although assaulted by a wave of enemies. Kaladin dashed down the\nincline, skidding in places, sliding on blood. His fear had vanished. It had\nbeen replaced by worry for his brother.\nHe arrived at the company line just as enemy squads were assaulting.\nHe tried to scramble farther behind the lines to search for Tien, but he\nwas caught in the wave of attacks. He stumbled to the side, joining a squad\nof spearmen.\nThe enemy was on them in a second. Kaladin held his spear in two\nhands, standing at the edge of the other spearmen and trying not to get in\ntheir way. He didn’t really know what he was doing. He barely knew\nenough to use his shieldmate for protection. The exchange happened\nquickly, and Kaladin made only a single thrust. The enemy was rebuffed,\nand he managed to avoid taking a wound.\nHe stood, panting, gripping his spear.\n“You,” an authoritative voice said. A man was pointing at Kaladin,\nknots at his shoulders. The squadleader. “About time my team got some of\nthose reinforcements. For a time there, I thought Varth was going to get\nevery man. Where’s your shield?”\nKaladin scrambled to grab one off a fallen soldier nearby. As he was\nworking, the squadleader swore behind him. “Damnation. They’re coming\nagain. Two prongs this time. We can’t hold like this.”\nA man in a green messenger’s vest scrambled over a nearby rock"

We can’t hold like this.”\nA man in a green messenger’s vest scrambled over a nearby rock\nformation. “Hold against the east assault, Mesh!”\n“What about that wave to the south?” the squadleader—Mesh—\nbellowed.\n“It’s handled for now. Hold east! Those are your orders!” The\nmessenger scrambled on, delivering a similar message to the next squad in\nline. “Varth. Your squad is to hold east!”\nKaladin got up with his shield. He needed to go find Tien. He couldn’t\n—\nHe stumbled to a stop. There, in the next squad down the line, stood\nthree figures. Younger boys, looking small in their armor and holding their\nspears uncertainly. One was Tien. His team of reserves had obviously been\nsplit apart to fill holes in other squads.\n“Tien!” Kaladin screamed, falling out of line as the enemy troops came\nupon them. Why were Tien and the other two positioned in the middle front\nof the squad formation? They barely knew how to hold a spear!\nMesh yelled after Kaladin, but Kaladin ignored him. The enemy was\nupon them in a moment, and Mesh’s squad broke, losing their discipline\nand turning to a more frenzied, unorganized resistance.\nKaladin felt something like a thump against his leg. He stumbled,\nhitting the ground, and realized with shock that he’d been stabbed with a\nspear. He felt no pain. Odd.\nTien! he thought, forcing himself up. Someone loomed above him, and\nKaladin reacted immediately, rolling as a spear came down for his heart.\nHis own spear was back in his hands before he realized he’d grabbed it, and\nhe whipped it upward.\nThen he froze. He’d just driven his spear through the enemy soldier’s\nneck. It had happened so quickly. I just killed a man.\nHe rolled over, letting the enemy drop to his knees as Kaladin yanked\nhis spear free. Varth’s squad was back a little farther. The enemy hit it a\nlittle while after attacking where Kaladin had been. Tien and the other two\nwere still in the front.\n“Tien!” Kaladin yelled.\nThe boy looked toward him, eyes opening wide. He actually smiled.\nBehind him, the rest of the squad pulled back. Leaving the three untrained\nboys exposed.\nAnd, sensing weakness, the enemy soldiers descended on Tien and the\nothers. There was an armored lighteyes at their front, in gleaming steel. He\nswung a sword.\nKaladin’s brother fell just like that. One eyeblink and he was standing\nthere, looking terrified. The next he was on the ground.\n“No!” Kaladin screamed. He tried to get to his feet, but slipped to his\nknees. His leg didn’t work right.\nVarth’s squad hurried forward, attacking the enemies—who had been\ndistracted with Tien and the other two. They’d placed the untrained at the\nfront to stop the momentum of the enemy attack.\n“No, no, no!” Kaladin screamed. He used his spear to hoist himself to\nhis feet, then stumbled forward.

It couldn’t\nbe over that quickly.\nIt was a miracle that nobody struck Kaladin down as he stumbled the\nrest of the distance. He barely thought about it. He just watched where Tien\nhad fallen. There was thunder. No. Hooves. Amaram had arrived with his\ncavalry, and they were sweeping through the enemy lines.\nKaladin didn’t care. He finally reached the spot. There, he found three\ncorpses: young, small, lying in a hollow in the stone. Horrified, numb,\nKaladin reached out his hand and rolled over the one that was face-down.\nTien’s dead eyes stared upward.\nKaladin continued to kneel beside the body. He should have bound his\nwound, should have moved back to safety, but he was too numb. He just\nknelt.\n“About time he rode down here,” a voice said.\nKaladin looked up, noting a group of spearmen gathering nearby,\nwatching the cavalry.\n“He wanted them to bunch up against us,” one the spearmen said. He\nhad knots on the shoulders. Varth, their squadleader. Such keen eyes the\nman had. Not a brutish lout. Lean, thoughtful.\nI should feel anger, Kaladin thought. I should feel… something.\nVarth looked down at him, then at the bodies of the three dead\nmessenger boys.\n“You bastard,” Kaladin hissed. “You put them in front.”\n“You work with what you have,” Varth said, nodding to his team, then\npointing at a fortified position. “If they give me men who can’t fight, I’ll\nfind another use for them.” He hesitated as his team marched away. He\nseemed regretful. “Gotta do what you can to stay alive, son. Turn a liability\ninto an advantage whenever you can. Remember that, if you live.”\nWith that, he jogged off.\nKaladin looked down. Why couldn’t I protect him? he thought, looking\nat Tien, remembering his brother’s laugh. His innocence, his smile, his\nexcitement at exploring the hills outside Hearthstone.\nPlease. Please let me protect him. Make me strong enough.\nHe felt so weak. Blood loss. He found himself slumping to the side,\nand with tired hands, he tied off his wound. And then, feeling terribly\nvacant inside, he lay down beside Tien and pulled the body close.\n“Don’t worry,” Kaladin whispered. When had he started to cry? “I’ll\nbring you home. I’ll protect you, Tien. I’ll bring you back….”\nHe held the body into the evening, long past the end of the battle,\nclinging to it as it slowly grew cold.\nKaladin blinked. He wasn’t in that hollow with Tien. He was on the plateau.\nHe could hear men dying in the distance.\nHe hated thinking of that day. He almost wished he’d never gone\nlooking for Tien. Then he wouldn’t have had to watch. Wouldn’t have had\nto kneel there, powerless, as his brother was slaughtered.\nIt was happening again. Rock, Moash, Teft. They were all going to die.\nAnd here he lay, powerless again. He could barely move. He felt so\ndrained."

I—”\nAmaram slaughtered his men in front of him.\nA nameless Shardbearer killed Dallet.\nA lighteyes killed Tien.\nNo.\nKaladin rolled over and forced himself to his feet, wavering on weak\nlegs.\nNo!\nBridge Four hadn’t set its bridge yet. That surprised him. They were\nstill pushing it across the chasm, the Parshendi crowding up on the other\nside, eager, their song becoming more frantic. His delusions had seemed\nlike hours, but had passed in just a few heartbeats.\nNO!\nLopen’s litter was in front of Kaladin. A spear rested amid the drained\nwater bottles and ragged bandages, steel head reflecting sunlight. It\nwhispered to him. It terrified him, and he loved it.\nWhen the time comes, I hope you’re ready. Because this lot will need\nyou.\nHe seized the spear, the first real weapon he had held since his display\nin the chasm so many weeks ago. Then he started to run. Slowly at first.\nPicking up speed. Reckless, his body exhausted. But he did not stop. He\npushed forward, harder, charging toward the bridge. It was only halfway\nacross the chasm.\nSyl shot out in front of him, looking back, worried. “The Words,\nKaladin!”\nRock cried out as Kaladin ran onto the bridge as it was moving. The\nwood wobbled beneath him. It was out over the chasm, but hadn’t reached\nthe other side.\n“Kaladin!” Teft yelled. “What are you doing?”\nKaladin screamed, reaching the end of the bridge. Finding a tiny surge\nof strength somewhere, he raised his spear and threw himself off the end of\nthe wooden platform, launching into the air above the cavernous void.\nBridgemen cried out in dismay. Syl zipped about him with worry.\nParshendi looked up with amazement as a lone bridgeman sailed through\nthe air toward them.\nHis drained, worn-out body barely had any strength left. In that\nmoment of crystallized time, he looked down on his enemies. Parshendi\nwith their marbled red and black skin. Soldiers raising finely crafted\nweapons, as if to cut him from the sky. Strangers, oddities in carapace\nbreastplates and skullcaps. Many of them wearing beards.\nBeards woven with glowing gemstones.\nKaladin breathed in.\nLike the power of salvation itself—like rays of sunlight from the eyes\nof the Almighty—Stormlight exploded from those gemstones. It streamed\nthrough the air, pulled in visible streams, like glowing columns of\nluminescent smoke.

He fell into a crouch, spear under his arm, a small\nring of Stormlight expanding from him in a wave, pushed down to the\nstones by his fall. Stunned, the Parshendi shied away, eyes widening, song\nfaltering.\nA trickle of Stormlight closed the wounds on his arm. He smiled, spear\nheld before him. It was as familiar as the body of a lover long lost.\nThe Words, a voice said, urgent, as if directly into his mind. In that\nmoment, Kaladin was amazed to realize that he knew them, though they’d\nnever been told to him.\n“I will protect those who cannot protect themselves,” he whispered.\nThe Second Ideal of the Knights Radiant.\nA crack shook the air, like an enormous clap of thunder, though the sky was\ncompletely clear. Teft stumbled back—having just set the bridge in place—\nand found himself gaping with the rest of Bridge Four. Kaladin exploded\nwith energy.\nA burst of whiteness washed out from him, a wave of white smoke.\nStormlight. The force of it slammed into the first rank of Parshendi, tossing\nthem backward, and Teft had to hold his hand up against the vibrancy of the\nlight.\n“Something just changed,” Moash whispered, hand up. “Something\nimportant.”\nKaladin raised his spear. The powerful light began to subside,\nretreating. A more subdued glow began to steam off his body. Radiant, like\nsmoke from an ethereal fire.\nNearby, some of the Parshendi fled, though others stepped up, raising\nweapons in challenge. Kaladin spun into them, a living storm of steel,\nwood, and determination.\n“They named it the Final Desolation, but they lied. Our gods lied. Oh,\nhow they lied. The Everstorm comes. I hear its whispers, see its\nstormwall, know its heart.”\n—Tanatanes 1173, 8 seconds pre-death.

He had to keep\nmoving, punching through the Parshendi, leading his men toward the\nwestern chasm.\nHis father’s horse and his own were still safe, carrying some wounded\nthrough the back ranks. The Shardbearers didn’t dare mount, though. In\nthese close quarters, the Ryshadium would be chopped down and their\nriders dropped.\nThis was the type of battlefield maneuver that would have been\nimpossible without Shardbearers.

They\nformed a wedge behind their Shardbearers, prying the Parshendi armies\nopen, using spearman formations to cut through and keep going forward.\nAdolin moved at almost a jog. The incline of the hill worked in their\nfavor, giving them better footing, letting them rumble down the slope like\ncharging chulls. The chance to survive when all had been thought lost gave\nthe men a surge of energy for one last dash toward freedom.\nThey took enormous casualties. Already, Dalinar’s force had lost\nanother thousand of his four, probably more. But it didn’t matter. The\nParshendi fought to kill, but the Alethi—this time—fought to live.\nLiving Heralds above, Teft thought, watching Kaladin fight. Just moments\nago, the lad had looked near death, skin a dull grey, hands shaking. Now he\nwas a shining whirlwind, a storm wielding a spear. Teft had known many a\nbattlefield, but he had never seen anything remotely like this. Kaladin held\nthe ground before the bridge by himself. White Stormlight streamed from\nhim like a blazing fire. His speed was incredible, nearly inhuman, and his\nprecision—each thrust of the spear hit a neck, side, or other unarmored\ntarget of Parshendi flesh.\nIt was more than the Stormlight. Teft had only a fragmentary\nrecollection of the things his family had tried to teach him, but those\nmemories all agreed. Stormlight did not grant skill. It could not make a man\ninto something he was not. It enhanced, it strengthened, it invigorated.\nIt perfected.\nKaladin ducked low, slamming the butt against the leg of a Parshendi,\ndropping him to the ground, and came up to block an axe swing by catching\nthe haft with that of his spear. He let go with one hand, sweeping the tip of\nthe spear up under the arm of the Parshendi and ramming it into his armpit.\nAs that Parshendi fell, Kaladin pulled his spear free and slammed the end\ninto a Parshendi head that had gotten too close. The butt of the spear\nshattered with a spray of wood, and the Parshendi’s carapace helm\nexploded.\nNo, this wasn’t just Stormlight. This was a master of the spear with his\ncapacity enhanced to astonishing levels.\nThe bridgemen gathered around Teft, amazed. His wounded arm didn’t\nseem to hurt as much as it should. “He’s like a part of the wind itself,”\nDrehy said. “Pulled down and given life. Not a man at all. A spren.”\n“Sigzil?” Skar asked, eyes wide. “You ever seen anything like this?”\nThe dark-skinned man shook his head.\n“Stormfather,” Peet whispered. “What… what is he?”\n“He’s our bridgeleader,” Teft said, snapping out of his reverie. On the\nother side of the chasm, Kaladin barely dodged a blow from a Parshendi\nmace. “And he needs our help! First and second teams, you take the left\nside. Don’t let the Parshendi get around him.

And Lopen, toss him a spear that isn’t broken!”\nDalinar roared, striking down a group of Parshendi swordsmen. He charged\nover their bodies, running up a short incline and throwing himself in a leap,\ndropping several feet into the Parshendi below, sweeping out with his\nBlade. His armor was an enormous weight upon his back, but the energy of\nhis struggle kept him going. The Cobalt Guard—the straggling members\nwho were left—roared and leaped off the incline behind him.\nThey were doomed. Those bridgemen would be dead by now. But\nDalinar blessed them for their sacrifice. It might have been meaningless as\nan end, but it had changed the journey. This was how his soldiers should fall\n—not cornered and frightened, but fighting with passion.\nHe would not slide quietly into the dark. No indeed. He shouted his\ndefiance again as he smashed into a group of Parshendi, whirling and\nhauling his Shardblade in a circling sweep. He stumbled through the patch\nof dead Parshendi, their eyes burning as they fell.\nAnd Dalinar burst out onto open stone.\nHe blinked, stunned. We did it, he thought in disbelief. We cut all the\nway through. Behind him, soldiers roared, their tired voices sounding nearly\nas amazed as he felt. Just ahead of him, a final group of Parshendi lay\nbetween Dalinar and the chasm. But their backs were turned to him. Why\nwere they—\nThe bridgemen.\nThe bridgemen were fighting. Dalinar gaped, lowering Oathbringer\nwith numb arms. That little force of bridgemen held the bridgehead,\nfighting desperately against the Parshendi who were trying to force them\nback.\nIt was the most amazing, most glorious thing Dalinar had ever seen.\nAdolin let out a whoop, breaking through the Parshendi to Dalinar’s\nleft. The younger man’s armor was scratched, cracked, and scored, and his\nhelm had shattered, leaving his head dangerously exposed. But his face was\nexultant.\n“Go, go,” Dalinar bellowed, pointing. “Give them support, storm it! If\nthose bridgemen fall, we’re all dead!”\nAdolin and the Cobalt Guard dashed forward. Gallant and Sureblood,\nAdolin’s Ryshadium, galloped past, carrying three wounded each. Dalinar\nhated to have left so many wounded on the slopes, but the Codes were clear.\nIn this case, protecting the men he could save was more important.\nDalinar turned to strike at the main body of Parshendi to his left,\nmaking certain the corridor remained open for his troops.

Sweat\nhad soaked through the brow rag attached to Dalinar’s helm, and drops of it\nfell, overwhelming his eyebrows and falling into his left eye. He cursed,\nreaching to open his visor—then froze.\nThe enemy troops were parting. There, standing among them, was a\nseven-foot-tall giant of a Parshendi in gleaming silver Shardplate. It fit as\nonly Plate could, having molded to his large stature. His Shardblade was\nwicked and barbed, like flames frozen into metal. He raised it to Dalinar in\na salute.\n“Now?” Dalinar bellowed incredulously. “Now you come?”\nThe Shardbearer stepped forward, steel boots clanking on stone. The\nother Parshendi backed away.\n“Why not earlier?” Dalinar demanded, hurriedly setting himself into\nWindstance, blinking his left eye against the sweat. He stood near the\nshadow of a large, oblong rock formation shaped like a book on its side.\n“Why wait out the entire battle only to attack now? When…”\nWhen Dalinar was about to get away. Apparently the Parshendi\nShardbearer had been willing to let his fellows throw themselves at Dalinar\nwhen it seemed obvious he would fall. Perhaps they let the regular soldiers\ntry to win Shards, as was done in human armies. Now that Dalinar might\nescape, the potential loss of a Plate and Blade was too great, and so the\nShardbearer had been sent to fight him.\nThe Shardbearer stepped up, speaking in the thick Parshendi language.\nDalinar didn’t understand a word of it. He raised his Blade and fell into\nstance. The Parshendi said something further, then grunted and stepped\nforward, swinging.\nDalinar cursed to himself, still blinded in his left eye. He dodged back,\nswinging his Blade and slapping the enemy’s weapon. The parry shook\nDalinar inside his armor. His muscles responded sluggishly. Stormlight still\nleaked from cracks in his armor, but it was abating. It wouldn’t be much\nlonger before the Plate stopped responding.\nThe Parshendi Shardbearer attacked again. His stance was unfamiliar\nto Dalinar, but there was something practiced about it. This wasn’t a savage\nplaying with a powerful weapon. He was a trained Shardbearer. Dalinar was\nonce again forced to parry, something Windstance wasn’t intended do to.\nHis weight-laden muscles were too sluggish to dodge, and his Plate was too\ncracked to risk letting himself get hit.\nThe blow nearly threw him out of stance. He clenched his teeth,\nthrowing weight behind his weapon and intentionally overcorrecting as the\nParshendi’s next blow came. The Blades met with a furious clang, throwing\noff a shower of sparks like a bucket of molten metal dashed into the air.\nDalinar recovered quickly and threw himself forward, trying to slam\nhis shoulder into his enemy’s chest. The Parshendi was still full of power,\nhowever, his Plate uncracked. He got out of the way and quite nearly hit\nDalinar on the back.\nDalinar twisted just in time.

The Parshendi followed, as Dalinar had hoped. The precarious footing\nraised the stakes—which was just fine with him. A single blow could ruin\nDalinar. That meant taking risks.\nAs the Parshendi neared the top of the formation, Dalinar attacked,\nusing the advantage of surer footing and high ground. The Parshendi didn’t\nbother dodging. He took a hit to the helm, which cracked, but gained a\nchance to swing at Dalinar’s legs.\nDalinar leaped backward, feeling painfully sluggish. He barely got out\nof the way, and wasn’t able to get in a second strike as the Parshendi\nclimbed atop the formation.\nThe Parshendi man made an aggressive thrust. Setting his jaw, Dalinar\nraised his forearm to block and stepped into the attack, praying to the\nHeralds that his forearm plate would deflect the blow. The Parshendi blade\nconnected, shattering the Plate, sending a shock up Dalinar’s arm. The\ngauntlet on his fist suddenly felt like a lead weight, but Dalinar kept\nmoving, swinging his blade for his own attack.\nNot at the Parshendi’s armor, but at the stone beneath him.\nEven as the molten shards of Dalinar’s forearm plate sprayed in the air,\nhe sheared through the rock shelf under his opponent’s feet. The entire\nsection broke free, sending the Shardbearer tumbling backward toward the\nground. He hit with a crash.\nDalinar slammed his fist—the one with the broken armguard—into the\nground and released the gauntlet. It unlatched and he pulled his hand free\ninto the air, sweat making it feel cold. He left the gauntlet—it wouldn’t\nwork properly now that the forearm piece was gone—and roared as he\nswung his Blade single-handed. He sliced through another chunk of the\nrock and sent it falling down toward the Shardbearer.\nThe Parshendi stumbled to his feet, but the rock smashed down on top\nof him, sending out a splash of Stormlight and a deep cracking sound.\nDalinar climbed down, trying to get to the Parshendi while he was still.\nUnfortunately, Dalinar’s right leg was dragging, and when he reached the\nground, he walked in a limp. If he took the boot off, he wouldn’t be able to\nhold up the rest of the Shardplate.\nHe gritted his teeth, stopping as the Parshendi stood up. He’d been too\nslow. The Parshendi’s armor, though cracked in several places, was\nnowhere near as strained as Dalinar’s. Impressively, he’d managed to retain\nhis Shardblade. He leveled his armored head at Dalinar, eyes hidden behind\nthe slit in the helm. Around them, the other Parshendi watched silently,\nforming a ring, but not interfering.\nDalinar raised his Blade, holding it in one gauntleted hand and one\nbare one. The breeze was cold on his clammy, exposed hand.\nThere was no use running.

The unity of body and\nmind, hands and feet reacting instantly, faster than thoughts could be\nformed. The clarity and familiarity of the old spear forms, learned during\nthe most terrible time in his life.\nHis weapon was an extension of himself; he moved it as easily and\ninstinctively as he did his fingers. Spinning, he cut through the Parshendi,\nbringing retribution to those who had slaughtered so many of his friends.\nRepayment for each and every arrow loosed at his flesh.\nWith Stormlight making an ecstatic pulse within him, he felt a rhythm\nto the battle. Almost like the beat of the Parshendi song.\nAnd they did sing. They’d recovered from seeing him drink in the\nStormlight and speak the Words of the Second Ideal. They now attacked in\nwaves, fervently trying to get to the bridge and knock it free. Some had\nleaped to the other side to attack from that direction, but Moash had led\nbridgemen to respond there. Amazingly, they held.\nSyl twirled around Kaladin in a blur, riding the waves of Stormlight\nthat rose from his skin, moving like a leaf on the winds of a storm.\nEnraptured. He’d never seen her like this before.\nHe didn’t break his attacks—in a way, there was only one attack, as\neach strike flowed directly into the next. His spear never stopped, and\ntogether with his men, he pushed the Parshendi back, accepting each\nchallenge as they stepped forward in pairs.\nKilling. Slaughtering. Blood flew in the air and the dying groaned at\nhis feet. He tried not to pay too much attention to that. They were the\nenemy. Yet the sheer glory of what he did seemed at odds with the\ndesolation he caused.\nHe was protecting. He was saving. Yet he was killing. How could\nsomething so terrible be so beautiful at the same time?\nHe ducked the swing of a fine silvery sword, then brought his spear\naround to the side, crushing ribs. He spun the spear, shattering its already\nfractured length against the side of the Parshendi’s comrade. He threw the\nremains at a third man, then caught a new spear as Lopen tossed it to him.\nThe Herdazian was collecting them from the fallen Alethi nearby to give to\nKaladin when needed.\nWhen you engaged a man, you learned something about him. Were\nyour enemies careful and precise? Did they bully their way forward,\naggressive and domineering? Did they spout curses to make you enraged?\nWere they ruthless, or did they leave an obviously incapacitated man to\nlive?\nHe was impressed by the Parshendi. He fought dozens of them, each\nwith a slightly different style of combat. It seemed they were sending only\ntwo or four at him at a time. Their attacks were careful and controlled, and\neach pair fought as a team. They seemed to respect him for his skill.\nMost telling, they seemed to back away from fighting Skar or Teft,\nwho were wounded, instead focusing on Kaladin, Moash, and the other\nspearmen who showed the most skill.

These were professional soldiers who\nheld to an honorable battlefield ethic he had found absent in most of the\nAlethi. In them, he found what he’d always hoped he would find in the\nsoldiers of the Shattered Plains.\nThat realization rocked him. He found himself respecting the\nParshendi as he killed them.\nIn the end, the storm within drove him forward. He had chosen a\ncourse, and these Parshendi would slaughter Dalinar Kholin’s army without\na moment’s regret. Kaladin had committed himself. He would see himself\nand his men through it.\nHe wasn’t certain how long he fought. Bridge Four held out\nremarkably well. Surely they didn’t fight for very long, otherwise they\nwould have been overwhelmed. Yet the multitude of wounded and dying\nParshendi around Kaladin seemed to indicate hours.\nHe was both relieved and oddly disappointed when a figure in Plate\nbroke through the Parshendi ranks, releasing a flood of soldiers in blue.\nKaladin reluctantly stepped back, heart thumping, the storm within\ndampened. The light had stopped streaming off his skin noticeably. The\ncontinual supply of Parshendi with gems in their braids had kept him fueled\nduring the early part of the fight, but the later ones had come to him without\ngemstones. Another indication that they weren’t the simpleminded\nsubhumans the lighteyes claimed they were. They’d seen what he was\ndoing, and even if they hadn’t understood it, they’d countered it.\nHe had enough Light to keep him from collapsing. But as the Alethi\npushed back the Parshendi, Kaladin realized how timely their arrival had\nbeen.\nI need to be very careful with this, he thought. The storm within made\nhim thirst for motion and attack, but using it drained his body. The more of\nit he used, and the faster he used it, the worse it was when he ran out.\nAlethi soldiers took up perimeter defense on both sides of the bridge,\nand the exhausted bridgemen fell back, many sitting down and holding\nwounds. Kaladin hurried over to them. “Report!”\n“Three dead,” Rock said grimly, kneeling beside bodies he’d laid out.\nMalop, Earless Jaks, and Narm.\nKaladin frowned in sorrow. Be glad the rest live, he told himself. It\nwas easy to think. Hard to accept. “How are the rest of you?”\nFive more had serious wounds, but Rock and Lopen had seen to them.\nThose two were learning quite well from Kaladin’s instruction. There was\nlittle more Kaladin could do for the wounded. He glanced at Malop’s body.\nThe man had taken an axe cut to the arm, severing it and splintering the\nbone. He’d died from blood loss. If Kaladin hadn’t been fighting, he might\nhave been able to—\nNo. No regrets for the moment.\n“Pull back across,” he said to the bridgemen, pointing. “Teft, you’re in\ncommand. Moash, you strong enough to stay with me?”\n“Sure am,” Moash said, a grin on his bloody face. He looked excited,"

All three of the dead had been on his side, but he and the\nothers had fought remarkably well.\nThe other bridgemen retreated. Kaladin turned to inspect the Alethi\nsoldiers. It was like looking into a triage tent. Every man had a wound of\nsome sort. The ones at the center stumbled and limped. Those at the\noutsides still fought, their uniforms bloodied and torn. The retreat had\ndissolved into chaos.\nHe made his way through the wounded, waving for them to cross the\nbridge. Some did as he said. Others stood about, looking dazed. Kaladin\nrushed up to one group that seemed better off than most. “Who’s in\ncommand here?”\n“It…” The soldier’s face had been cut across the cheek. “Brightlord\nDalinar.”\n“Immediate command. Who’s your captain?”\n“Dead,” the man said. “And my companylord. And his second.”\nStormfather, Kaladin thought. “Across the bridge with you,” he said,\nthen moved on. “I need an officer! Who’s in command of the retreat?”\nAhead, he could make out a figure in scratched blue Shardplate,\nfighting at the front of group. That would be Dalinar’s son Adolin. He was\nbusy holding the Parshendi off; bothering him would not be wise.\n“Over here,” a man called. “I’ve found Brightlord Havar! He’s\ncommander of the rear guard!”\nFinally, Kaladin thought, rushing through the chaos to find a bearded\nlighteyed man lying on the ground, coughing blood. Kaladin looked him\nover, noting the enormous gut wound. “Who’s his second?”\n“Dead,” said the man beside the commander. He was lighteyed.\n“And you are?” Kaladin asked.\n“Nacomb Gaval.” He looked young, younger than Kaladin.\n“You’re promoted,” Kaladin said. “Get these men across the bridge as\nquickly as possible. If anyone asks, you’ve been given a field commission\nas commander of the rear guard. If anyone claims to outrank you, send them\nto me.”\nThe man started. “Promoted… Who are you? Can you do that?”\n“Someone needs to,” Kaladin snapped. “Go. Get to work.”\n“I—”\n“Go!” Kaladin bellowed.\nRemarkably, the lighteyed man saluted him and began yelling for his\nsquad. Kholin’s men were wounded, battered, and dazed, but they were well\ntrained. Once someone took command, orders passed quickly. Squads\ncrossed the bridge, falling into marching formations. Likely, in the\nconfusion, they clung to these familiar patterns.\nWithin minutes, the central mass of Kholin’s army was flowing across\nthe bridge like sand in an hourglass. The ring of fighting contracted. Still,\nmen screamed and died in the anarchic tumult of sword against shield and\nspear against metal.\nKaladin hurriedly pulled the carapace off his armor—enraging the\nParshendi didn’t feel wise at the moment—then moved among the\nwounded, looking for more officers.

Apparently, those who were still\nbattleworthy were leading the two flanks who held back the Parshendi.\nTrailed by Moash, Kaladin hurried to the central front line, where the\nAlethi seemed to be holding the best. Here, finally, he found someone in\ncommand: a tall, stately lighteyes with a steel breastplate and matching\nhelm, his uniform a darker shade of blue than the others. He directed the\nfighting from just behind the front lines.\nThe man nodded to Kaladin, yelling to be heard over the sounds of\nbattle. “You command the bridgemen?”\n“I do,” Kaladin said. “Why aren’t your men moving across the\nbridge?”\n“We are the Cobalt Guard,” the man said. “Our duty is to protect\nBrightlord Adolin.” The man pointed toward Adolin in his blue Shardplate\njust ahead. The Shardbearer seemed to be pushing toward something.\n“Where’s the highprince?” Kaladin yelled.\n“We’re not sure.” The man grimaced. “His guardsmen have vanished.”\n“You have to pull back. The bulk of the army is across. If you remain\nhere, you’ll be surrounded!”\n“We will not leave Brightlord Adolin. I’m sorry.”\nKaladin looked around. The groups of Alethi fighting at the flanks\nwere barely holding their ground, but they wouldn’t fall back until ordered.\n“Fine,” Kaladin said, raising his spear and pushing his way through to\nthe front line. Here, the Parshendi fought with vigor. Kaladin cut down one\nby the neck, spinning into the middle of a group, flashing out with his spear.\nHis Stormlight was nearly gone, but these Parshendi had gemstones in their\nbeards. Kaladin breathed in—just a little, so as to not reveal himself to the\nAlethi soldiers—and launched into a full attack.\nThe Parshendi fell back before his furious assault, and the few\nmembers of the Cobalt Guard around him stumbled away, looking stunned.\nIn seconds, Kaladin had a dozen Parshendi on the ground around him,\nwounded or dead. That opened a gap, and he tore through, Moash on his\nheels.\nA lot of the Parshendi were focused on Adolin, whose blue Shardplate\nwas scraped and cracked. Kaladin had never seen a suit of Shardplate in\nsuch a terrible state. Stormlight rose from those cracks in much the way it\nsteamed from Kaladin’s skin when he held—or used—a lot of it.\nThe fury of a Shardbearer at war gave Kaladin pause. He and Moash\nstopped just outside of the man’s fighting range, and the Parshendi ignored\nthe bridgemen, trying with obvious desperation to take down the\nShardbearer. Adolin cut down through multiple men at once—but, as\nKaladin had seen only once before, his Blade did not slice flesh. Parshendi\neyes burned and blackened, and dozens fell dead, Adolin collecting corpses\naround him like ripened fruit falling from a tree.\nAnd yet, Adolin was obviously struggling.

His helm was gone, though\nhe’d replaced it with a regular spearman’s cap. His left leg limped, nearly\ndragging. That Blade of his was deadly, but the Parshendi drew closer and\ncloser.\nKaladin didn’t dare step into range. “Adolin Kholin!” he bellowed.\nThe man kept fighting.\n“Adolin Kholin!” Kaladin yelled again, feeling a little puff of\nStormlight leave him, his voice booming.\nThe Shardbearer paused, then looked back at Kaladin. Reluctantly, the\nShardbearer pulled back, letting the Cobalt Guard—using the path opened\nby Kaladin—rush forward and hold back the Parshendi.\n“Who are you?” Adolin demanded, reaching Kaladin. His proud,\nyouthful face was slick with sweat, his hair a matted mess of blond mixed\nwith black.\n“I’m the man who saved your life,” Kaladin said. “I need you to order\nthe retreat. Your troops can’t fight any longer.”\n“My father is out there, bridgeman,” Adolin said, pointing with his\noverly large Blade. “I saw him just moments ago. His Ryshadium went for\nhim, but neither horse nor man has returned. I’m going to lead a squad to\n—”\n“You are going to retreat!” Kaladin said, exasperated. “Look at your\nmen, Kholin!

You need to get them out.”\n“I won’t abandon my father,” Adolin said stubbornly.\n“For the peace of… If you fall, Adolin Kholin, these men have\nnothing. Their commanders are wounded or dead. You can’t go to your\nfather; you can barely walk! I repeat, get your men to safety!”\nThe young Shardbearer stepped back, blinking at Kaladin’s tone. He\nlooked northeastward, toward where a figure in slate grey suddenly\nappeared on a rock outcropping, fighting against another figure in\nShardplate. “He’s so close….”\nKaladin took a deep breath. “I’ll go for him. You lead the retreat. Hold\nthe bridge, but only the bridge.”\nAdolin glared at Kaladin. He took a step, but something in his armor\ngave out, and he stumbled, going to one knee. Teeth gritted, he managed to\nrise. “Captainlord Malan,” Adolin bellowed. “Take your soldiers, go with\nthis man. Get my father out!”\nThe man Kaladin had spoken to earlier saluted crisply. Adolin glared at\nKaladin again, then hefted his Shardblade and stalked with difficulty toward\nthe bridge.\n“Moash, go with him,” Kaladin said.\n“But—”\n“Do it, Moash,” Kaladin said grimly, glancing toward the outcropping\nwhere Dalinar fought.

Most Parshendi in this\npatch were distracted by Dalinar’s fight or the battle to get to the bridge; the\nranks were thin here between the two fronts.\nKaladin moved quickly, drawing in more Light as he ran, dodging and\nscrambling around Parshendi who tried to engage him. Within moments,\nhe’d reached the place where Dalinar had been fighting. Though the rock\nshelf was now empty, a large group of Parshendi were gathered around its\nbase.\nThere, he thought, leaping forward.\nA horse whinnied. Dalinar looked up in shock as Gallant charged into the\nopen ring of ground the watching Parshendi had made. The Ryshadium had\ncome to him. How… where…? The horse should have been free and safe\non the staging plateau.\nIt was too late. Dalinar was on one knee, beaten down by the enemy\nShardbearer. The Parshendi kicked, smashing his foot into Dalinar’s chest,\nthrowing him backward.\nA hit to the helm followed. Another. Another. The helm exploded, and\nthe force of the hits left Dalinar dazed. Where was he? What was\nhappening? Why was he pinned by something so heavy?\nShardplate, he thought, struggling to rise. I’m wearing… my\nShardplate….\nA breeze blew across his face. Head blows; you had to be careful of\nhead blows, even when wearing Plate. His enemy stood over him, looming,\nand seemed to inspect him. As if searching for something.\nDalinar had dropped his Blade. The common Parshendi soldiers\nsurrounded the duel. They forced Gallant back, making the horse whinny.\nHe reared. Dalinar watched him, vision swimming.\nWhy didn’t the Shardbearer just finish him? The Parshendi giant\nleaned down, then spoke. The words were thick with accent, and Dalinar’s\nmind nearly dismissed them. But here, up close, Dalinar realized\nsomething. He understood what was being said. The accent was nearly\nimpenetrable, but the words were in Alethi.\n“It is you,” the Parshendi Shardbearer said. “I have found you at last.”\nDalinar blinked in surprise.\nSomething disturbed the back ranks of the watching Parshendi\nsoldiers. There was something familiar about this scene, Parshendi all\naround, Shardbearer in danger. Dalinar had lived it before, but from the\nother side.\nThat Shardbearer couldn’t be talking to him. Dalinar had been hit too\nhard on the head. He must be delusional. What was that disturbance in the\nring of Parshendi watchers?\nSadeas, Dalinar found himself thinking, his mind confused. He’s come\nto rescue me, as I rescued him.\nUnite them….\nHe’ll come, Dalinar thought. I know he will. I will gather them….\nThe Parshendi were yelling, moving, twisting. Suddenly, a figure\nexploded through them. Not Sadeas at all. A young man with a strong face\nand long, curling black hair. He carried a spear.\nAnd he was glowing."

The Parshendi Shardbearer was bent\ndown, focused on Dalinar. The Parshendi’s Plate was leaking Stormlight\nthrough a large fissure in the leg.\nSo—memory flashing back to the time he rescued Amaram—Kaladin\ngot in close and slammed his spear into the crack.\nThe Shardbearer screamed and dropped his Blade in surprise. It puffed\nto mist. Kaladin whipped his spear free and dodged backward. The\nShardbearer swung toward him with a gauntleted fist, but missed. Kaladin\njumped in and—throwing his full strength behind the blow—rammed his\nspear into the cracked leg armor again.\nThe Shardbearer screamed even louder, stumbling, then fell to his\nknees. Kaladin tried to pull his spear free, but the man crumpled on top of\nit, snapping the shaft. Kaladin dodged back, now facing a ring of Parshendi,\nempty-handed, Stormlight streaming from his body.\nSilence. And then, they began speaking again, the words they’d said\nbefore. “Neshua Kadal!” They passed it among themselves, whispering,\nlooking confused.

Kaladin knelt down, commanding\nmost of his Stormlight into the stony ground, retaining just enough to keep\nhim going, but not enough to make him glow. Then he hurried over to the\narmored horse at the side of the ring of Parshendi.\nThe Parshendi shied away from him, looking terrified. He took the\nreins and quickly returned to the highprince.\nDalinar shook his head, trying to clear his mind. His vision still swam, but\nhis thoughts were reforming. What had happened? He’d been hit on the\nhead, and… and now the Shardbearer was down.\nDown? What had caused the Shardbearer to fall? Had the creature\nreally talked to him? No, he must have imagined that. That, and the young\nspearman glowing. He wasn’t doing so now. Holding Gallant’s reins, the\nyoung man waved at Dalinar urgently. Dalinar forced himself to his feet.\nAround them, the Parshendi were muttering something unintelligible.\nThat Shardplate, Dalinar thought, looking at the kneeling Parshendi.

So you will get on your horse and we will escape this death-\ntrap. Do you understand?”\nDalinar met the young man’s eyes. Then nodded. Of course. He was\nright; they had to leave the enemy Shardbearer. How would they get the\narmor out, anyway? Tow the corpse all the way?\n“Retreat!” Dalinar bellowed to his soldiers, pulling himself into\nGallant’s saddle. He barely made it, his armor had so little Stormlight left.\nSteady, loyal Gallant sprang into a gallop down the corridor of escape\nhis men had bought for him with their blood. The nameless spearman\ndashed behind him, and the Cobalt Guard fell in around them. A larger force\nof his troops was ahead, on the escape plateau. The bridge still stood,\nAdolin waiting anxiously at its head, holding it for Dalinar’s retreat.\nWith a rush of relief, Dalinar galloped across the wooden deck,\nreaching the adjoining plateau. Adolin and last of his troops filed along\nbehind him.\nHe turned Gallant, looking eastward. The Parshendi crowded up to the\nchasm, but did not give chase. A group of them worked on the chrysalis\natop the plateau. It had been forgotten by all sides in the fervor. They had\nnever followed before, but if they changed their mind now, they could harry\nDalinar’s force all the way back to the permanent bridges.\nBut they didn’t. They formed ranks and began to chant another of their\nsongs, the same one they sang every time the Alethi forces retreated. As\nDalinar watched, a figure in cracked, silvery Shardplate and a red cape\nstumbled to their forefront. The helm had been removed, but it was too\ndistant to make out any features on the black and red marbled skin.\nDalinar’s erstwhile foe raised his Shardblade in a motion that was\nunmistakable. A salute, a gesture of respect. Instinctively, Dalinar\nsummoned his Blade, and ten heartbeats later raised it to salute in return.\nThe bridgemen pulled the bridge across the chasm, separating the\narmies.\n“Set up triage,” Dalinar bellowed. “We don’t leave anyone behind who\nhas a chance at living. The Parshendi will not attack us here!”\nHis men let out a shout. Somehow, escaping felt like more of a victory\nthan any gemheart they’d won. The tired Alethi troops divided into"

Eight had marched to battle, and they became eight again—\nthough several had only a few hundred members remaining. Those men\ntrained for field surgery looked through the ranks while the remaining\nofficers got survivor counts. The men began to sit down among the\npainspren and exhaustionspren, bloodied, some weaponless, many with torn\nuniforms.\nOn the other plateau, the Parshendi continued their odd song.\nDalinar found himself focusing on the bridge crew. The youth who had\nsaved him was apparently their leader. Had he fought down a Shardbearer?\nDalinar hazily remembered a quick, sharp encounter, a spear to the leg.\nClearly the young man was both skilled and lucky.\nThe bridgeman’s team acted with far more coordination and discipline\nthan Dalinar would have expected of such lowly men. He could wait no\nlonger. Dalinar nudged Gallant forward, crossing the stones and passing\nwounded, exhausted soldiers. That reminded him of his own fatigue, but\nnow that he had a chance to sit, he was recovering, his head no longer\nringing.\nThe leader of the bridge crew was seeing to a man’s wound, and his\nfingers worked with expertise. A man trained in field medicine, among\nbridgemen?\nWell, why not? Dalinar thought. It’s no odder than their being able to\nfight so well. Sadeas had been holding out on him.\nThe young man looked up. And, for the first time, Dalinar noticed the\nslave brands on the youth’s forehead, hidden by the long hair. The youth\nstood, posture hostile, folding his arms.\n“You are to be commended,” Dalinar said. “All of you. Why did your\nhighprince retreat, only to send you back for us?”\nSeveral of the bridgemen chuckled.\n“He didn’t send us back,” their leader said. “We came on our own.\nAgainst his wishes.”\nDalinar found himself nodding, and he realized that this was the only\nanswer that made sense. “Why?” Dalinar asked. “Why come for us?”\nThe youth shrugged. “You allowed yourself to get trapped in there\nquite spectacularly.”\nDalinar nodded tiredly. Perhaps he should have been annoyed at the\nyoung man’s tone, but it was only the truth. “Yes, but why did you come?\nAnd how did you learn to fight so well?”\n“By accident,” the young man said. He turned back to his wounded.\n“What can I do to repay you?” Dalinar asked.\nThe bridgeman looked back at him. “I don’t know. We were going to\nflee from Sadeas, disappear in the confusion. We might still, but he’ll\ncertainly hunt us down and kill us.”\n“I could take your men to my camp, make Sadeas free you from your\nbondage.”\n“I worry that he wouldn’t let us go,” the bridgeman said, eyes haunted.\n“And I worry that your camp would offer no safety at all. This move today\nby Sadeas. It will mean war between you two, will it not?”\nWould it? Dalinar had avoided thinking of Sadeas—survival had taken"

        "text": "by Sadeas. It will mean war between you two, will it not?”\nWould it? Dalinar had avoided thinking of Sadeas—survival had taken\nhis focus—but his anger at the man was a seething pit deep within. He\nwould exact revenge on Sadeas for this. But could he allow war between the\nprincedoms? It would shatter Alethkar. More than that, it would destroy the\nKholin house. Dalinar didn’t have the troops or the allies to stand against\nSadeas, not after this disaster.\nHow would Sadeas respond when Dalinar returned? Would he try to\nfinish the job, attacking? No, Dalinar thought. No, he did it this way for a\npurpose. Sadeas had not engaged him personally. He had abandoned\nDalinar, but by Alethi standards, that was another thing entirely. He didn’t\nwant to risk the kingdom either.\nSadeas wouldn’t want outright war, and Dalinar couldn’t afford\noutright war, despite his seething anger. He formed a fist, turning to look at\nthe spearman. “It will not turn to war,” Dalinar said. “Not yet, at least.”\n“Well, if that’s the case,” the spearman said, “then by taking us into\nyour camp, you commit robbery. The king’s law, the Codes my men always\nclaim you uphold, would demand that you return us to Sadeas. He won’t let\nus go easily.”\n“I will take care of Sadeas,” Dalinar said. “Return with me. I vow that\nyou will be safe. I promise it with every shred of honor I have.”\nThe young bridgeman met his eyes, searching for something. Such a\nhard man he was for one so young.\n“All right,” the spearman said. “We’ll return. I can’t leave my men\nback at camp and—with so many men now wounded—we don’t have the\nproper supplies to run.”\nThe young man turned back to his work, and Dalinar rode Gallant in\nsearch of a casualty report. He forced himself to contain his rage at Sadeas.\nIt was difficult. No, Dalinar could not let this turn to war—but neither could\nhe let things go back to the way they had been.\nSadeas had upset the balance, and it could never be regained. Not in\nthe same way.\n“All is withdrawn for me. I stand against the one who saved my life. I\nprotect the one who killed my promises. I raise my hand. The storm\nresponds.”\n—Tanatanev 1173, 18 seconds pre-death. A darkeyed mother of four in\nher sixty-second year.\nNavani pushed her way past the guards, ignoring their protests and the calls\nof her attending ladies. She forced herself to remain calm. She would\nremain calm! What she had heard was just rumor. It had to be.\nUnfortunately, the older she grew, the worse she became at\nmaintaining a brightlady’s proper tranquility. She hastened her step through\nSadeas’s warcamp. Soldiers raised hands toward her as she passed, either to\noffer her aid or to demand she halt. She ignored both; they’d never dare lay\na finger on her. Being the king’s mother gained one a few privileges.\nThe camp was messy and poorly laid out. Pockets of merchants,"

Pockets of merchants,\nwhores, and workers made their homes in shanties built on the leeward\nsides of barracks. Drippings of hardened crem hung from most leeward\neaves, like trails of wax left to pour over the side of a table. It was a distinct\ncontrast to the neat lines and scrubbed buildings of Dalinar’s warcamp.\nHe will be fine, she told herself. He’d better be fine!\nIt was a testament to her disordered state that she barely considered\nconstructing a new street pattern for Sadeas in her head. She made her way\ndirectly to the staging area, and arrived to find an army that hardly looked\nas if it had been to battle. Soldiers without any blood on their uniforms,\nmen chatting and laughing, officers walking down lines and dismissing the\nmen squad by squad.\nThat should have relieved her. This didn’t look like a force that had\njust suffered a disaster. Instead, it made her even more anxious.\nSadeas, in unmarred red Shardplate, was speaking with a group of\nofficers in the shade of a nearby canopy. She stalked up to the canopy, but\nhere a group of guards managed to bar her way, forming up shoulder to\nshoulder while one went to inform Sadeas of her arrival.\nNavani folded her arms impatiently. Perhaps she should have taken a\npalanquin, as her attending ladies had suggested. Several of them, looking\nbeleaguered, were just arriving at the staging area. A palanquin would be\nfaster in the long run, they had explained, as it would leave time for\nmessengers to be sent so Sadeas could receive her.\nOnce, she had obeyed such proprieties. She could remember being a\nyoung woman, playing the games expertly, delighting in ways to\nmanipulate the system. What had that gotten her? A dead husband whom\nshe’d never loved and a “privileged” position in court that amounted to\nbeing put out to pasture.\nWhat would Sadeas do if she just started screaming? The king’s own\nmother, bellowing like an axehound whose antenna had been twisted? She\nconsidered it as the soldier waited for a chance to announce her to Sadeas.\nFrom the corner of her eye, she noticed a youth in a blue uniform\narriving in the staging area, accompanied by a small honor guard of three\nmen. It was Renarin, for once bearing an expression other than calm\ncuriosity. Wide-eyed and frantic, he hurried up to Navani.\n“Mashala,” he pled in his quiet voice. “Please. What have you heard?”\n“Sadeas’s army returned without your father’s army,” Navani said.\n“There is talk of a rout, though it doesn’t look as if these men have been\nthrough one.” She glared at Sadeas, giving serious contemplation to\nthrowing a fit. Fortunately, he finally spoke with the soldier and then sent\nhim back.\n“You may approach, Brightness,” the man said, bowing to her.\n“About time,” she growled, shoving past and passing underneath the\ncanopy. Renarin joined her, walking more hesitantly.\n“Brightness Navani,” Sadeas said, clasping his hands behind his back,"

Renarin joined her, walking more hesitantly.\n“Brightness Navani,” Sadeas said, clasping his hands behind his back,\nimposing in his crimson Plate. “I had hoped to bring you the news at your\nson’s palace. I suppose that a disaster like this is too large to contain. I\nexpress my condolences at the loss of your brother.”\nRenarin gasped softly.\nNavani steeled herself, folding her arms, trying to quiet the screams of\ndenial and pain that came from the back of her mind. This was a pattern.\nShe often saw patterns in things. In this case, the pattern was that she could\nnever possess anything of value for long. It was always snatched from her\njust when it began to look promising.\nQuiet, she scolded herself. “You will explain,” she said to Sadeas,\nmeeting his gaze. She’d practiced that look over the de cades, and was\npleased to see that it discomfited him.\n“I’m sorry, Brightness,” Sadeas repeated, stammering. “The Parshendi\noverwhelmed your brother’s army. It was folly to work together. Our\nchange in tactics was so threatening to the savages that they brought every\nsoldier they could to this battle, surrounding us.”\n“And so you left Dalinar?”\n“We fought hard to reach him, but the numbers were simply\noverpowering. We had to retreat lest we lose ourselves as well! I would\nhave continued fighting, save for the fact that I saw your brother fall with\nmy own eyes, swarmed by Parshendi with hammers.” He grimaced. “They\nbegan carrying away chunks of bloodied Shardplate as prizes. Barbaric\nmonsters.”\nNavani felt cold. Cold, numb. How could this happen? After finally—\nfinally—making that stone-headed man see her as a woman, rather than as a\nsister. And now…\nAnd now…\nShe set her jaw against the tears. “I don’t believe it.”\n“I understand that the news is difficult.” Sadeas waved for an attendant\nto fetch her a chair. “I wish I had not been forced to bring it to you. Dalinar\nand I… well, I have known him for many years, and while we did not\nalways see the same sunrise, I considered him an ally. And a friend.” He\ncursed softly, looking eastward. “They will pay for this. I will see that they\npay.”\nHe seemed so earnest that Navani found herself wavering. Poor\nRenarin, pale-faced and wide-eyed, seemed stunned beyond the means to\nspeak. When the chair arrived, Navani refused it, so Renarin sat, earning a\nglance of disapproval from Sadeas. Renarin grasped his head in his hands,\nstaring at the ground. He was trembling.\nHe’s highprince now, Navani realized.\nNo. No. He was only highprince if she accepted the idea that Dalinar\nwas dead. And he wasn’t. He couldn’t be.\nSadeas had all of the bridges, she thought, looking down at the\nlumberyard.\nNavani stepped out into the late-afternoon sunlight, feeling its heat on"

She walked up to her attendants. “Brushpen,” she said to Makal,\nwho carried a satchel with Navani’s possessions. “The thickest one. And my\nburn ink.”\nThe short, plump woman opened the satchel, taking out a long\nbrushpen with a knob of hog bristles on the end as wide as a man’s thumb.\nNavani took it. The ink followed.\nAround her, the guards stared as Navani took the pen and dipped it into\nthe blood-colored ink. She knelt, and began to paint on the stone ground.\nArt was about creation. That was its soul, its essence. Creation and\norder. You took something disorganized—a splash of ink, an empty page—\nand you built something from it. Something from nothing. The soul of\ncreation.\nShe felt the tears on her cheeks as she painted. Dalinar had no wife and\nno daughters; he had nobody to pray for him. And so, Navani painted a\nprayer onto the stones themselves, sending her attendants for more ink. She\npaced off the size of the glyph as she continued its border, making it\nenormous, spreading her ink onto the tan rocks.\nSoldiers gathered around, Sadeas stepping from his canopy, watching\nher paint, her back to the sun as she crawled on the ground and furiously\ndipped her brushpen into the ink jars. What was a prayer, if not creation?\nMaking something where nothing existed. Creating a wish out of despair, a\nplea out of anguish. Bowing one’s back before the Almighty, and forming\nhumility from the empty pride of a human life.\nSomething from nothing. True creation.\nHer tears mixed with the ink. She went through four jars. She crawled,\nholding her safehand to the ground, brushing the stones and smearing ink\non her cheeks when she wiped the tears. When she finally finished, she\nknelt back on her knees before a glyph twenty paces long, emblazoned as if\nin blood. The wet ink reflected sunlight, and she fired it with a candle; the\nink was made to burn whether wet or dry. The flames burned across the\nlength of the prayer, killing it and sending its soul to the Almighty.\nShe bowed her head before the prayer. It was only a single character,\nbut a complex one. Thath. Justice.\nMen watched quietly, as if afraid of spoiling her solemn wish. A cold\nbreeze began blowing, whipping at pennants and cloaks. The prayer went\nout, but that was fine. It wasn’t meant to burn long.\n“Brightlord Sadeas!” an anxious voice called.\nNavani looked up. Soldiers parted, making way for a runner in green.\nHe hurried up to Sadeas, beginning to speak, but the highprince grabbed the\nman by the shoulder in a Shardplate grip and pointed, gesturing for his\nguards to make a perimeter. He pulled the messenger beneath the canopy.\nNavani continued to kneel beside her prayer. The flames left a black\nscar in the shape of the glyph on the ground. Someone stepped up beside\nher— Renarin. He went to one knee, resting a hand on her shoulder. “Thank\nyou, Mashala.”"

He went to one knee, resting a hand on her shoulder. “Thank\nyou, Mashala.”\nShe nodded, standing, her freehand sprinkled with drops of red\npigment. Her cheeks were still wet with tears, but she narrowed her eyes,\nlooking through the press of soldiers toward Sadeas. His expression was\nthunderous, face growing red, eyes wide with anger.\nShe turned and pushed her way through the press of soldiers,\nscrambling up to the rim of the staging field. Renarin and some of Sadeas’s\nofficers joined her in staring out over the Shattered Plains.\nAnd there they saw a creeping line of men limping back toward the\nwarcamps, led by a mounted man in slate-grey armor.\nDalinar rode Gallant at the head of two thousand six hundred and fifty-three\nmen. That was all that remained of his assault force of eight thousand.\nThe long trek back across the plateaus had given him time to think. His\ninsides were still a tempest of emotions. He flexed his left hand as he rode;\nit was now encased by a blue-painted Shardplate gauntlet borrowed from\nAdolin. It would take days to regrow Dalinar’s own gauntlet. Longer, if the\nParshendi tried to grow a full suit from the one he had left. They would fail,\nso long as Dalinar’s armorers fed Stormlight to his suit. The abandoned\ngauntlet would degrade and crumble to dust, a new one growing for\nDalinar.\nFor now, he wore Adolin’s. They had collected all of the infused\ngemstones among his twenty-six hundred men and used that Stormlight to\nrecharge and reinforce his armor. It was still scarred with cracks. Healing as\nmuch damage as it had sustained would take days, but the Plate was in\nfighting shape again, if it came to that.\nHe needed to make certain it didn’t. He intended to confront Sadeas,\nand he wanted to be armored when he did. In fact, he wanted to storm up\nthe incline to Sadeas’s warcamp and declare formal war on his “old friend.”\nPerhaps summon his Blade and see Sadeas dead.\nBut he wouldn’t. His soldiers were too weak, his position too tenuous.\nFormal war would destroy him and the kingdom. He had to do something\nelse. Something that protected the kingdom. Revenge would come.\nEventually. Alethkar came first.\nHe lowered his blue-gauntleted fist, gripping Gallant’s reins. Adolin\nrode a short distance away. They’d repaired his armor as well, though he\nnow lacked a gauntlet. Dalinar had refused the gift of his son’s gauntlet at\nfirst, but had given in to Adolin’s logic. If one of them was going to go\nwithout, it should be the younger man. Inside Shardplate, their differences\nin age didn’t matter—but outside of it, Adolin was a young man in his\ntwenties and Dalinar an aging man in his fifties.\nHe still didn’t know what to think of the visions, and their apparent\nfailure in telling him to trust Sadeas. He’d confront that later. One step at a\ntime.\n“Elthal,” Dalinar called. The highest-ranked officer who had survived"

The highest-ranked officer who had survived\nthe disaster, Elthal was a limber man with a distinguished face and a thin\nmustache. His arm was in a sling. He’d been one of those to hold the gap\nalongside Dalinar during the last part of the fight.\n“Yes, Brightlord?” Elthal asked, jogging over to Dalinar. All of the\nhorses save the two Ryshadium were carrying wounded.\n“Take the wounded to my warcamp,” Dalinar said. “Then tell Teleb to\nbring the entire camp to alert. Mobilize the remaining companies.”\n“Yes, Brightlord,” the man said, saluting. “Brightlord, what should I\ntell them to prepare for?”\n“Anything. But hopefully nothing.”\n“I understand, Brightlord,” Elthal said, leaving to follow the orders.\nDalinar turned Gallant to march over to the group of bridgemen, still\nfollowing their somber leader, a man named Kaladin. They’d left their\nbridge as soon as they’d reached the permanent bridges; Sadeas could send\nfor it eventually.\nThe bridgemen stopped as he approached, looking as tired as he felt,\nthen arranged themselves in a subtly hostile formation. They clung to their\nspears, as if certain he’d try to take them away. They had saved him, yet\nthey obviously didn’t trust him.\n“I’m sending my wounded back to my camp,” Dalinar said. “You\nshould go with them.”\n“You’re confronting Sadeas?” Kaladin asked.\n“I must.” I have to know why he did what he did. “I will buy your\nfreedom when I do.”\n“Then I’m staying with you,” Kaladin said.\n“Me too,” said a hawk-faced man at the side. Soon all of the\nbridgemen were demanding to stay.\nKaladin turned to them. “I should send you back.”\n“What?” asked an older bridgeman with a short grey beard. “You can\nrisk yourself, but we can’t? We have men back in Sadeas’s camp. We need\nto get them out. At the very least, we need to stay together. See this\nthrough.”\nThe others nodded. Again, Dalinar was struck by their discipline. More\nand more, he was certain Sadeas had nothing to do with that. It was this\nman at their head. Though his eyes were dark brown, he held himself like a\nbrightlord.\nWell, if they wouldn’t go, Dalinar wouldn’t force them. He continued\nto ride, and soon close to a thousand of Dalinar’s soldiers broke off and\nmarched south, toward his warcamp. The rest of them continued, toward\nSadeas’s camp. As they drew closer, Dalinar noticed a small crowd\ngathering at the final chasm. Two figures in particular stood at their\nforefront. Renarin and Navani.\n“What are they doing in Sadeas’s warcamp?” Adolin asked, smiling\nthrough his fatigue, edging Sureblood up beside Dalinar.\n“I don’t know,” Dalinar said. “But the Stormfather bless them for\ncoming.” Seeing their welcome faces, he began to feel it sink in—finally—\nthat he had survived the day."

Renarin was there waiting, and Dalinar\nrejoiced.\nFor once, the boy was displaying outright joy. Dalinar swung free from\nthe saddle and embraced his son.\n“Father,” Renarin said, “you live!”\nAdolin laughed, swinging out of his own saddle, armor clanking.\nRenarin pulled out of the embrace and grabbed Adolin on the shoulder,\npounding the Shardplate lightly with his other hand, grinning widely.\nDalinar smiled as well, turning from the brothers to look at Navani. She\nstood with hands clasped before her, one eyebrow raised. Her face, oddly,\nbore a few small smears of red paint.\n“You weren’t even worried, were you?” he said to her.\n“Worried?” she asked. Her eyes met his, and for the first time, he\nnoticed their redness. “I was terrified.”\nAnd then Dalinar found himself grabbing her in an embrace. He had to\nbe careful as he was in Shardplate, but the gauntlets let him feel the silk of\nher dress, and his missing helm let him smell the sweet floral scent of her\nperfumed soap. He held her as tightly as he dared, bowing his head and\npressing his nose into her hair.\n“Hmm,” she noted warmly, “it appears that I was missed. The others\nare watching. They’ll talk.”\n“I don’t care.”\n“Hmm… It appears I was very much missed.”\n“On the battlefield,” he said gruffly, “I thought I would die. And I\nrealized it was all right.”\nShe pulled her head back, looking confused.\n“I have spent too much of my time worrying about what people think,\nNavani. When I thought my time had arrived, I realized that all my\nworrying had been wasted. In the end, I was pleased with how I had lived\nmy life.” He looked down at her, then mentally unlatched his right gauntlet,\nletting it drop to the ground with a clank. He reached up with that callused\nhand, cupping her chin. “I had only two regrets. One for you, and one for\nRenarin.”\n“So, you’re saying you can just die, and it would be all right?”\n“No,” he said. “What I’m saying is that I faced eternity, and I saw\npeace there. That will change how I live.”\n“Without all of the guilt?”\nHe hesitated. “Being me, I doubt I’ll banish it entirely. The end was\npeace, but living… that is a tempest. Still, I see things differently now. It is\ntime to stop letting myself be shoved around by lying men.” He looked up,\ntoward the ridge above, where more soldiers in green were gathering. “I\nkeep thinking of one of the visions,” he said softly, “the latest one, where I\nmet Nohadon. He rejected my suggestion that he write down his wisdom.\nThere’s something there. Something I need to learn.”\n“What?” Navani asked.\n“I don’t know yet. But I’m close to figuring it out.” He held her close"

But I’m close to figuring it out.” He held her close\nagain, hand on the back of her head, feeling her hair. He wished for the\nPlate to be gone, to not be separated from her by the metal.\nBut the time for that had not yet come. Reluctantly, he released her,\nturning to the side, where Renarin and Adolin were watching them\nuncomfortably. His soldiers were looking up at Sadeas’s army, gathering on\nthe ridge.\nI can’t let this come to bloodshed, Dalinar thought, reaching down and\nputting his hand into the fallen gauntlet. The straps tightened, connecting to\nthe rest of the armor. But I’m also not going to slink back to my camp\nwithout confronting him. He at least had to know the purpose of the\nbetrayal. All had been going so well.\nBesides, there was the matter of his promise to the bridgemen. Dalinar\nwalked up the slope, bloodstained blue cloak flapping behind him. Adolin\nclanked up next to him on one side, Navani keeping pace on the other.\nRenarin followed, Dalinar’s remaining sixteen hundred troops marching up\nas well.\n“Father…” Adolin said, looking at the hostile troops.\n“Don’t summon your Blade. This will not come to blows.”\n“Sadeas abandoned you, didn’t he?” Navani asked quietly, eyes alight\nwith anger.\n“He didn’t just abandon us,” Adolin spat. “He set us up, then betrayed\nus.”\n“We survived,” Dalinar said firmly. The way ahead was becoming\nclearer. He knew what he needed to do. “He won’t attack us here, but he\nmight try to provoke us. Keep your sword as mist, Adolin, and don’t let our\ntroops make any mistakes.”\nThe soldiers in green parted reluctantly, holding spears. Hostile. To the\nside, Kaladin and his bridgemen walked near the front of Dalinar’s force.\nAdolin didn’t summon his Blade, though he regarded Sadeas’s troops\naround them with contempt. Dalinar’s soldiers couldn’t have felt easy about\nbeing surrounded by enemies once again, but they followed him onto the\nstaging field. Sadeas stood ahead. The treacherous highprince waited with\narms folded, still wearing his Shardplate, curly black hair blowing in the\nbreeze. Someone had burned an enormous thath glyph on the stones here,\nand Sadeas stood at its center.\nJustice. There was something magnificently appropriate about Sadeas\nstanding there, treading upon justice.\n“Dalinar,” Sadeas exclaimed, “old friend! It appears that I\noverestimated the odds against you. I apologize for retreating when you\nwere still in danger, but the safety of my men came first. I’m certain you\nunderstand.”\nDalinar stopped a short distance from Sadeas. The two faced each\nother, collected armies tense. A cold breeze whipped at a canopy behind\nSadeas.\n“Of course,” Dalinar said, his voice even. “You did what you had to\ndo.”\nSadeas relaxed visibly, though several of Dalinar’s soldiers muttered at\nthat. Adolin silenced them with pointed glances."

Navani gave\nhim a raised eyebrow, but retreated with the others when he urged her.\nDalinar looked back at Sadeas, and the man—looking curious—waved his\nown attendants back.\nDalinar walked up to the edge of the thath glyph, and Sadeas stepped\nforward until only inches separated them. They were matched in height.\nStanding this close, Dalinar thought he could see tension—and anger—in\nSadeas’s eyes. Dalinar’s survival had ruined months of planning.\n“I need to know why,” Dalinar asked, too quietly for any but Sadeas to\nhear.\n“Because of my oath, old friend.”\n“What?” Dalinar asked, hands forming fists.\n“We swore something together, years ago.” Sadeas sighed, losing his\nflippancy and speaking openly. “Protect Elhokar. Protect this kingdom.”\n“That’s what I was doing! We had the same purpose. And we were\nfighting together, Sadeas. It was working.”\n“Yes,” Sadeas said. “But I’m confident I can beat the Parshendi on my\nown now. Everything we’ve done together, I can manage by splitting my\narmy into two—one to race on ahead, a larger force to follow. I had to take\nthis chance to remove you. Dalinar, can’t you see? Gavilar died because of\nhis weakness. I wanted to attack the Parshendi from the start, conquer them.\nHe insisted on a treaty, which led to his death. Now you’re starting to act\njust like him. Those same ideas, the same ways of speaking. Through you\nthey begin to infect Elhokar. He dresses like you. He talks of the Codes to\nme, and of how perhaps we should enforce them through all the warcamps.\nHe’s beginning to think of retreating.”\n“And so you’d have me think this an act of honor?” Dalinar growled.\n“Not at all,” Sadeas said, chuckling. “I have struggled for years to\nbecome Elhokar’s most trusted advisor—but there was always you,\ndistracting him, holding his ear despite my every eff ort. I won’t pretend\nthis was only about honor, though there was an element of that to it. In the\nend, I just wanted you gone.”\nSadeas’s voice grew cold. “But you are going insane, old friend. You\nmay name me a liar, but I did what I did today as a mercy. A way of letting\nyou die in glory, rather than watching you descend further and further. By\nletting the Parshendi kill you, I could protect Elhokar from you and turn\nyou into a symbol to remind the others what we’re really doing here. Your\ndeath might have become what finally united us. Ironic, if you consider it.”\nDalinar breathed in and out. It was hard not to let his anger, his\nindignation, consume him. “Then tell me one thing. Why not pin the\nassassination attempt on me? Why clear me, if you were only looking to\nbetray me later on?”\nSadeas snorted softly. “Bah. Nobody would really believe that you"

        "text": "assassination attempt on me? Why clear me, if you were only looking to\nbetray me later on?”\nSadeas snorted softly. “Bah. Nobody would really believe that you\ntried to kill the king. They’d gossip, but they wouldn’t believe it. Blaming\nyou too quickly would have risked implicating myself.” He shook his head.\n“I think Elhokar knows who tried to kill him. He’s admitted as much to me,\nthough he won’t give me the name.”\nWhat? Dalinar thought. He knows? But… how? Why not tell us who?\nDalinar adjusted his plans. He wasn’t certain if Sadeas was telling the truth,\nbut if he was, he could use this.\n“He knows it wasn’t you,” Sadeas continued. “I can read that much in\nhim, though he doesn’t realize how transparent he is. Blaming you would\nhave been pointless. Elhokar would have defended you, and I might very\nwell have lost the position of Highprince of Information. But it did give me\na wonderful opportunity to make you trust me again.”\nUnite them…. The visions. But the man who spoke to Dalinar in them\nhad been dead wrong. Acting with honor hadn’t won Sadeas’s loyalty. It had\njust opened Dalinar up to betrayal.\n“If it means anything,” Sadeas said idly, “I’m fond of you. I really am.\nBut you are a boulder in my path, and a force working—against its own\nknowledge— to destroy Gavilar’s kingdom. When the chance came along, I\ntook it.”\n“It wasn’t simply a convenient opportunity,” Dalinar said. “You set this\nup, Sadeas.”\n“I planned, but I’m often planning. I don’t always act on my options.\nToday I did.”\nDalinar snorted. “Well, you’ve shown me something today, Sadeas—\nshown it to me by the very act of trying to remove me.”\n“And what was that?” Sadeas asked, amused.\n“You’ve shown me that I’m still a threat.”\nThe highprinces continued their low-pitched conversation. Kaladin stood to\nthe side of Dalinar’s soldiers, exhausted, with the members of Bridge Four.\nSadeas spared a glance for them. Matal stood in the crowd, and had\nbeen watching Kaladin’s team the entire time, red-faced. Matal probably\nknew that he would be punished as Lamaril had been. They should have\nlearned. They should have killed Kaladin at the start.\nThey tried, he thought. They failed.\nHe didn’t know what had happened to him, what had gone on with Syl\nand the words in his head. It seemed that Stormlight worked better for him\nnow. It had been more potent, more powerful. But now it was gone, and he\nwas so tired. Drained. He’d pushed himself, and Bridge Four, too far. Too\nhard.\nPerhaps he and the others should have gone to Kholin’s camp. But Teft\nwas right; they needed to see this through.\nHe promised, Kaladin thought. He promised he would free us from\nSadeas.\nAnd yet, where had the promises of lighteyes gotten him in the past?\nThe highprinces broke off their conference, separating, stepping back\nfrom one another."

We\ncan speak later about what went wrong, though I think it is safe to assume\nthat our alliance has proven unfeasible.”\n“Unfeasible,” Dalinar said. “A kind way of putting it.” He nodded\ntoward the bridgemen. “I will take these bridgemen with me to my camp.”\n“I’m afraid I cannot part with them.”\nKaladin’s heart sank.\n“Surely they aren’t worth much to you,” Dalinar said. “Name your\nprice.”\n“I’m not looking to sell.”\n“I will pay sixty emerald broams per man,” Dalinar said. That drew\ngasps from the watching soldiers on both sides. It was easily twenty times\nthe price of a good slave.\n“Not for a thousand each, Dalinar,” Sadeas said. Kaladin could see the\ndeaths of his bridgemen in those eyes. “Take your soldiers and go. Leave\nmy property here.”\n“Do not press me on this, Sadeas,” Dalinar said.\nSuddenly, the tension was back. Dalinar’s officers lowered hands to\nswords, and his spearmen perked up, gripping the hafts of their weapons.\n“Do not press you?” Sadeas asked. “What kind of threat is that? Leave\nmy camp. It’s obvious that there is nothing more between us. If you try to\nsteal my property, I will have every justification in attacking you.”\nDalinar stood in place. He looked confident, though Kaladin saw no\nreason why. And another promise dies, Kaladin thought, turning away. In\nthe end, for all his good intentions, this Dalinar Kholin was the same as the\nothers.\nBehind Kaladin, men gasped in surprise.\nKaladin froze, then spun around. Dalinar Kholin had summoned his\nmassive Shardblade; it dripped beads of water from having just been\nsummoned. His armor steamed faintly, Stormlight rising from the cracks.\nSadeas stumbled back, eyes wide. His honor guard drew their swords.\nAdolin Kholin reached his hand to the side, apparently beginning to\nsummon his own weapon.\nDalinar took one step forward, then drove his Blade point-first into the\nmiddle of the blackened glyph on the stone. He took a step back. “For the\nbridgemen,” he said.\nSadeas blinked. Muttering voices fell silent, and the people on the field\nseemed too stunned, even, to breathe.\n“What?” Sadeas asked.\n“The Blade,” Dalinar said, firm voice carrying in the air. “In exchange\nfor your bridgemen. All of them. Every one you have in camp. They\nbecome mine, to do with as I please, never to be touched by you again. In\nexchange, you get the sword.”\nSadeas looked down at the Blade, incredulous. “This weapon is worth\nfortunes. Cities, palaces, kingdoms.”\n“Do we have a deal?” Dalinar asked.\n“Father, no!” Adolin Kholin said, his own Blade appearing in his hand.\n“You—”"

He kept his eyes on\nSadeas. “Do we have a deal?” he asked, each word sharp.\nKaladin stared, unable to move, unable to think.\nSadeas looked at the Shardblade, eyes full of lust. He glanced at\nKaladin, hesitated just briefly, then reached and grabbed the Blade by the\nhilt. “Take the storming creatures.”\nDalinar nodded curtly, turning away from Sadeas. “Let’s go,” he said\nto his entourage.\n“They’re worthless, you know,” Sadeas said. “You’re of the ten fools,\nDalinar Kholin! Don’t you see how mad you are? This will be remembered\nas the most ridiculous decision ever made by an Alethi highprince!”\nDalinar didn’t look back. He walked up to Kaladin and the other\nmembers of Bridge Four. “Go,” Dalinar said to them, voice kindly. “Gather\nyour things and the men you left behind. I will send troops with you to act\nas guards. Leave the bridges and come swiftly to my camp. You will be safe\nthere. You have my word of honor on it.”\nHe began to walk away.\nKaladin shook off his numbness. He scrambled after the highprince,\ngrabbing his armored arm. “Wait. You— That— What just happened?”\nDalinar turned to him. Then, the highprince laid a hand on Kaladin’s\nshoulder, the gauntlet gleaming blue, mismatched with the rest of his slate-\ngrey armor. “I don’t know what has been done to you. I can only guess what\nyour life has been like. But know this. You will not be bridgemen in my\ncamp, nor will you be slaves.”\n“But…”\n“What is a man’s life worth?” Dalinar asked softly.\n“The slavemasters say one is worth about two emerald broams,”\nKaladin said, frowning.\n“And what do you say?”\n“A life is priceless,” he said immediately, quoting his father.\nDalinar smiled, wrinkle lines extending from the corners of his eyes.\n“Coincidentally, that is the exact value of a Shardblade. So today, you and\nyour men sacrificed to buy me twenty-six hundred priceless lives. And all I\nhad to repay you with was a single priceless sword. I call that a bargain.”\n“You really think it was a good trade, don’t you?” Kaladin said,\namazed.\nDalinar smiled in a way that seemed strikingly paternal. “For my\nhonor? Unquestionably. Go and lead your men to safety, soldier. Later\ntonight, I will have some questions for you.”\nKaladin glanced at Sadeas, who held his new Blade with awe. “You\nsaid you’d take care of Sadeas. This was what you intended?”\n“This wasn’t taking care of Sadeas,” Dalinar said. “This was taking\ncare of you and your men. I still have work to do today.”\nDalinar found King Elhokar in his palace sitting room."

I still have work to do today.”\nDalinar found King Elhokar in his palace sitting room.\nDalinar nodded once more to the guards outside, then closed the door.\nThey seemed troubled. As well they should; his orders had been irregular.\nBut they would do as told. They wore the king’s colors, blue and gold, but\nthey were Dalinar’s men, chosen specifically for their loyalty.\nThe door shut with a snap. The king was staring at one of his maps,\nwearing his Shardplate. “Ah, Uncle,” he said, turning to Dalinar. “Good. I\nhad wanted to speak with you. Do you know of these rumors about you and\nmy mother? I realize that nothing untoward could be happening, but I do\nworry about what people think.”\nDalinar crossed the room, booted feet thumping on the rich rug.\nInfused diamonds hung in the corners of the room, and the carved walls had\nbeen set with tiny chips of quartz to sparkle and reflect the light.\n“Honestly, Uncle,” Elhokar said, shaking his head. “I’m growing very\nintolerant of your reputation in camp. What they are saying reflects poorly\non me, you see, and…” He trailed off as Dalinar stopped about a pace from\nhim. “Uncle? Is everything all right? My door guards reported some kind of\nmishap with your plateau assault today, but my mind was full of thoughts.\nDid I miss anything vital?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar said. Then he raised his leg and kicked the king in the\nchest.\nThe strength of the blow tossed the king backward against his desk.\nThe fine wood shattered as the heavy Shardbearer crashed through it.\nElhokar hit the floor, his breastplate cracked just faintly. Dalinar stepped up\nto him, then delivered another kick to the king’s side, cracking the\nbreastplate again.\nElhokar began shouting in panic. “Guards! To me! Guards!”\nNobody came. Dalinar kicked again, and Elhokar cursed, catching his\nboot. Dalinar grunted, but bent down and grabbed Elhokar by the arm, then\nyanked him to his feet, tossing him toward the side of the room. The king\nstumbled on the rug, crashing through a chair. Round lengths of wood\nscattered, splinters spraying out.\nWide-eyed, Elhokar scrambled to his feet. Dalinar advanced on him.\n“What has gone wrong with you, Uncle?” Elhokar yelled. “You’re\nmad! Guards! Assassin in the king’s chamber! Guards!” Elhokar tried to run\nfor the door, but Dalinar threw his shoulder against the king, tossing the\nyounger man to the ground again.\nElhokar rolled, but got a hand under himself and climbed to his knees,\nthe other hand to the side. A puff of mist appeared in it as he summoned his\nBlade.\nDalinar kicked the king’s hand just as the Shardblade dropped into it.\nThe blow knocked the Blade free, and it dissolved back to mist\nimmediately.\nElhokar frantically swung a fist at Dalinar, but Dalinar caught it, then\nreached down and hauled the king to his feet.

Elhokar struggled to rise again,\nbut the breastplate was a focus for the Shardplate’s power. Missing it left\narms and legs heavy. He went to one knee beside the squirming king.\nElhokar’s Shardblade formed again, but Dalinar grabbed the king’s wrist\nand smashed it against the stone floor, knocking the Blade free yet again. It\nvanished into mist.\n“Guards!” Elhokar squealed. “Guards, guards, guards!”\n“They won’t come, Elhokar,” Dalinar said softly. “They’re my men,\nand I left them with orders not to enter—or let anyone else enter—no matter\nwhat they heard. Even if that included pleas for help from you.”\nElhokar fell silent.\n“They are my men, Elhokar,” Dalinar repeated. “I trained them. I\nplaced them there. They’ve always been loyal to me.”\n“Why, Uncle? What are you doing? Please, tell me.” He was nearly\nweeping.\nDalinar leaned down, getting close enough to smell the king’s breath.\n“The girth on your horse during the hunt,” Dalinar said quietly. “You cut it\nyourself, didn’t you?”\nElhokar’s eyes grew wider.\n“The saddles were switched before you came to my camp,” Dalinar\nsaid. “You did that because you didn’t want to ruin your favorite saddle\nwhen it flew free of the horse. You were planning for it to happen, you\nmade it happen. That’s why you’ve been so certain that the girth was cut.”\nCringing, Elhokar nodded. “Someone was trying to kill me, but you\nwouldn’t believe! I… I worried it might be you! So I decided… I…”\n“You cut your own strap,” Dalinar said, “to create a visible, obvious-\nseeming attempt on your life. Something that would get me or Sadeas to\ninvestigate.”\nElhokar hesitated, then nodded again.\nDalinar closed his eyes, breathing out slowly. “Don’t you realize what\nyou did, Elhokar? You brought suspicion on me from across the camps! You\ngave Sadeas an opportunity to destroy me.” He opened his eyes, looking\ndown at the king.\n“I had to know,” Elhokar whispered. “I couldn’t trust anyone.” He\ngroaned beneath Dalinar’s weight.\n“What of the cracked gemstones in your Shardplate? Did you place\nthose too?”\n“No.”\n“Then maybe you did uncover something,” Dalinar said with a grunt.\n“I guess you can’t be completely blamed.”\n“Then you’ll let me up?”\n“No.” Dalinar leaned down farther.

They all whisper that the Blackthorn\nshould have taken the throne for himself years ago. Your guard is loyal to\nme. There would be nobody to avenge you. Nobody would care.”\nElhokar breathed out as Dalinar pressed his hand down just slightly.\n“Do you understand?” Dalinar asked quietly.\n“No!”\nDalinar sighed, then released the younger man and stood up. Elhokar\ninhaled with a gasp.\n“Your paranoia may be unfounded,” Dalinar said, “or it may be well\nfounded. Either way, you need to understand something. I am not your\nenemy.”\nElhokar frowned. “So you’re not going to kill me?”\n“Storms, no! I love you like a son, boy.”\nElhokar rubbed his chest. “You… have very odd paternal instincts.”\n“I spent years following you,” Dalinar said. “I gave you my loyalty,\nmy devotion, and my counsel. I swore myself to you—promising myself,\nvowing to myself, that I would never covet Gavilar’s throne. All to keep my\nheart loyal. Despite this, you don’t trust me. You pull a stunt like that one\nwith the girth, implicating me, giving your own enemies position against\nyou without knowing it.”\nDalinar stepped toward the king. Elhokar cringed.\n“Well, now you know,” Dalinar said, voice hard. “If I’d wanted to kill\nyou, Elhokar, I could have done it a dozen times over. A hundred times\nover. It appears you won’t accept loyalty and devotion as proof of my\nhonesty. Well, if you act like a child, you get treated like one. You know\nnow, for a fact, that I don’t want you dead.

Adolin and I barely survived.”\n“What?” Elhokar said, forcing himself up to a sitting position. “That’s\nimpossible!”\n“Far from it,” Dalinar said, looking at his nephew. “He saw a chance to\npull out, letting the Parshendi destroy us. So he did it. A very Alethi thing to\ndo.

We’ll have to be much more careful\nwith our guard. If you’re right, someone is already trying to kill you, so we\nshould be doing that anyway.”\nElhokar stared at him, then looked at the broken furniture, rubbing his\nchest. “You’re serious, aren’t you?”\n“Yes.” He tossed the seal to Elhokar. “You’re going to have your\nscribes draw up my appointment right after I leave.”\n“But I thought you said it was wrong to force men to follow the\nCodes,” Elhokar said. “You said that the best way to change people was to\nlive right, and then let them be influenced by your example!”\n“That was before the Almighty lied to me,” Dalinar said. He still didn’t\nknow what to think of that. “Much of what I told you, I learned from The\nWay of Kings. But I didn’t understand something. Nohadon wrote the book\nat the end of his life, after creating order—after forcing the kingdoms to\nunite, after rebuilding lands that had fallen in the Desolation.\n“The book was written to embody an ideal. It was given to people who\nalready had momentum in doing what was right. That was my mistake.\nBefore any of this can work, our people need to have a minimum level of\nhonor and dignity. Adolin said something to me a few weeks back,\nsomething profound. He asked me why I forced my sons to live up to such\nhigh expectations, but let others go about their errant ways without\ncondemnation.\n“I have been treating the other highprinces and their lighteyes like\nadults. An adult can take a principle and adapt it to his needs. But we’re not\nready for that yet. We’re children. And when you’re teaching a child, you\nrequire him to do what is right until he grows old enough to make his own\nchoices. The Silver Kingdoms didn’t begin as unified, glorious bastions of\nhonor.

Well, it’s time to stop letting them. We’re going to win this war, and\nwe’re going to turn Alethkar into a place that men will envy again.

We’re going to do it—or you and I are going to die\nin the attempt.”\n“You say that with eagerness.”\n“Because I finally know exactly what to do,” Dalinar said, standing up\nstraight. “I was trying to be Nohadon the peacemaker. But I’m not. I’m the\nBlackthorn, a general and a warlord. I have no talent for back-room\npoliticking, but I am very good at training troops. Starting tomorrow, every\nman in each of these camps will be mine. As far as I’m concerned, they’re\nall raw recruits. Even the highprinces.”\n“Assuming I make the proclamation.”\n“You will,” Dalinar said. “And in return, I promise to find out who is\ntrying to kill you.”\nElhokar snorted, beginning to remove his Shardplate piece by piece.\n“After that announcement goes out, discovering who’s trying to kill me will\nbecome easy. You can put every name in the warcamps on the list!”\nDalinar’s smile widened. “At least we won’t have to guess, then. Don’t\nbe so glum, nephew. You learned something today. Your uncle doesn’t want\nto kill you.”\n“He just wants to make me a target.”\n“For your own good, son,” Dalinar said, walking to the door. “Don’t\nfret too much. I’ve got some plans on how, exactly, to keep you alive.” He\nopened the door, revealing a nervous group of guards keeping at bay a\nnervous group of servants and attendants.\n“He’s just fine,” Dalinar said to them. “See?” He stepped aside, letting\nthe guards and servants in to attend their king.\nDalinar turned to go. Then he hesitated. “Oh, and Elhokar? Your\nmother and I are now courting. You’ll want to start growing accustomed to\nthat.”\nDespite everything else that had happened in the last few minutes, this\ngot a look of pure astonishment from the king. Dalinar smiled and pulled\nthe door closed, walking away with a firm step.\nMost everything was still wrong. He was still furious at Sadeas, pained\nby the loss of so many of his men, confused at what to do with Navani,\ndumbfounded by his visions, and daunted by the idea of bringing the\nwarcamps to unity.\nBut at least now he had something to work with.\nShallan lay quietly in the bed of her little hospital room.

She’d cried herself\ndry, then had actually retched into the bedpan, over what she had done. She\nfelt miserable.\nShe’d betrayed Jasnah. And Jasnah knew. Somehow, disappointing the\nprincess felt worse than the theft itself. This entire plan had been foolish\nfrom the start.\nBeyond that, Kabsal was dead. Why did she feel so sick about that?\nHe’d been an assassin, trying to kill Jasnah, willing to risk Shallan’s life to\nachieve his goals. And yet, she missed him. Jasnah hadn’t seemed surprised\nthat someone would want to kill her; perhaps assassins were a common part\nof her life. She likely thought Kabsal a hardened killer, but he’d been sweet\nwith Shallan. Could that all really have been a lie?\nHe had to be somewhat sincere, she told herself, curled up on her bed.\nIf he didn’t care for me, why did he work so hard to get me to take the jam?\nHe had handed Shallan the antidote first, rather than taking it himself.\nAnd yet, he did take it eventually, she thought. He put that fingerful of\njam into his mouth. Why didn’t the antidote save him?\nThis question began to haunt her. As it did, something else struck her,\nsomething she would have noticed earlier, had she not been distracted by\nher own betrayal.\nJasnah had eaten the bread.\nArms wrapped around herself, Shallan sat up, pulling back to the bed’s\nheadboard. She ate it, but she wasn’t poisoned, she thought. My life makes\nno sense lately. The creatures with the twisted heads, the place with the\ndark sky, the Soulcasting… and now this.\nHow had Jasnah survived? How?\nWith trembling fingers, Shallan reached to the pouch on the stand\nbeside her bed. Inside, she found the garnet sphere that Jasnah had used to\nsave her. It gave off weak light; most had been used in the Soulcasting. It\nwas enough light to illuminate her sketchpad sitting beside the bed. Jasnah\nprobably hadn’t even bothered to look through it. She was so dismissive of\nthe visual arts. Next to the sketchpad was the book Jasnah had given her.\nThe Book of Endless Pages. Why had she left that?\nShallan picked up the charcoal pencil and flipped through to a blank\npage in her sketchbook. She passed several pictures of the symbol-headed\ncreatures, some set in this very room. They lurked around her, always. At\nsome times, she thought she saw them in the corners of her eyes. At others,\nshe could hear them whispering. She hadn’t dared speak back to them\nagain.\nShe began to draw, fingers unsteady, sketching Jasnah on that day in\nthe hospital. Sitting beside Shallan’s bed, holding the jam. Shallan hadn’t\ntaken a distinct Memory, and wasn’t as accurate as if she had, but she\nremembered well enough to draw Jasnah with her finger stuck into the jam.\nShe had raised that finger to smell the strawberries. Why? Why put her\nfinger into the jam? Wouldn’t raising the jar to her nose have been enough?"

Wouldn’t raising the jar to her nose have been enough?\nJasnah hadn’t made any faces at the scent. In fact, Jasnah hadn’t\nmentioned that the jam had spoiled. She’d just replaced the lid and handed\nback the jar.\nShallan flipped to another blank page and drew Jasnah with a piece of\nbread raised to her lips. After eating it, she’d grimaced. Odd.\nShallan lowered her pen, looking at that sketch of Jasnah, piece of\nbread pinched between her fingers. It wasn’t a perfect reproduction, but it\nwas close enough. In the sketch, it looked like the piece of bread was\nmelting. As if it were squished unnaturally between Jasnah’s fingers as she\nput it into her mouth.\nCould it… could it be?\nShallan slid out of the bed, gathering the sphere and carrying it in her\nhand, sketchpad tucked under her arm. The guard was gone. Nobody\nseemed to care what happened to her; she was being shipped off in the\nmorning anyway.\nThe stone floor was cold beneath her bare feet. She wore only the\nwhite robe, and felt almost naked. At least her safehand was covered. There\nwas a door to the city outside at the end of the hallway, and she stepped\nthrough it.\nShe crossed quietly through the city, making her way to the Ralinsa,\navoiding dark alleyways. She walked up toward the Conclave, long red hair\nblowing free behind her, drawing more than a few strange looks and stares.\nIt was so late at night that nobody on the roadway cared enough to ask if\nshe wanted help.\nThe master-servants at the entrance to the Conclave let her pass. They\nrecognized her, and more than a few asked if she needed help. She declined,\nwalking alone down to the Veil. She passed inside, then looked up at the\nwalls full of balconies, some of them lit with spheres.\nJasnah’s alcove was occupied. Of course it was. Always working,\nJasnah was. She’d be particularly bothered by having lost so much time\nover Shallan’s presumed suicide attempt.\nThe lift felt rickety beneath Shallan’s feet as the parshmen lifted her up\nto Jasnah’s level. She rode in silence, feeling disconnected from the world\naround her. Walking around through the palace—through the city—in only a\nrobe? Confronting Jasnah Kholin again? Hadn’t she learned?\nBut what did she have to lose?\nShe walked down the familiar stone hallway to the alcove, weak blue\nsphere held before her. Jasnah sat at her desk. Her eyes looked\nuncharacteristically fatigued, dark circles underneath, her face stressed. She\nlooked up and stiffened as she saw Shallan. “You are not welcome here.”\nShallan walked in anyway, surprised by how calm she felt. Her hands\nshould be shaking.\n“Don’t make me call the soldiers to get rid of you,” Jasnah said. “I\ncould have you thrown in prison for a hundred years for what you did. Do\nyou have any idea what—”\n“The Soulcaster you wear is a fake,” Shallan said quietly. “It was a\nfake the whole time, even before I made the swap.”\nJasnah froze."

        "text": "you have any idea what—”\n“The Soulcaster you wear is a fake,” Shallan said quietly. “It was a\nfake the whole time, even before I made the swap.”\nJasnah froze.\n“I wondered why you didn’t notice the switch,” Shallan said, sitting in\nthe room’s other chair. “I spent weeks confused. Had you noticed, but\ndecided to keep quiet in order to catch the thief? Hadn’t you Soulcast in all\nthat time? It didn’t make any sense. Unless the Soulcaster I stole was a\ndecoy.”\nJasnah relaxed. “Yes. Very clever of you to realize that. I keep several\ndecoys. You’re not the first to try to steal the fabrial, you see. I keep the real\none carefully hidden, of course.”\nShallan took out her sketchpad and searched through for a specific\npicture. It was the image she’d drawn of the strange place with the sea of\nbeads, the floating flames, the distant sun in a black, black sky. Shallan\nregarded it for a moment. Then she turned it and held it up for Jasnah.\nThe look of utter shock Jasnah displayed was nearly worth the night\nspent feeling sick and guilty. Jasnah’s eyes bulged and she sputtered for a\nmoment, trying to find words. Shallan blinked, taking a Memory of that.\nShe couldn’t help herself.\n“Where did you find that?” Jasnah demanded. “What book described\nthat scene to you?”\n“No book, Jasnah,” Shallan said, lowering the picture. “I visited that\nplace. The night when I accidentally Soulcast the goblet in my room to\nblood, then covered it up by faking a suicide attempt.”\n“Impossible. You think I’d believe—”\n“There is no fabrial, is there, Jasnah? There’s no Soulcaster. There\nnever has been. You use the fake ‘fabrial’ to distract people from the fact\nthat you have the power to Soulcast on your own.”\nJasnah fell silent.\n“I did it too,” Shallan said. “The Soulcaster was tucked away in my\nsafepouch. I wasn’t touching it—but that didn’t matter. It was a fake. What\nI did, I did without it. Perhaps being near you has changed me, somehow. It\nhas something to do with that place and those creatures.”\nAgain, no reply.\n“You suspected Kabsal of being an assassin,” Shallan said. “You knew\nimmediately what had happened when I fell; you were expecting poison, or\nat least were aware that it was possible. But you thought the poison was in\nthe jam. You Soulcast it when you opened the lid and pretended to smell it.\nYou didn’t know how to re-create strawberry jam, and when you tried, you\nmade that vile concoction. You thought to get rid of poison. But you\ninadvertently Soulcast away the antidote.\n“You didn’t want to eat the bread either, just in case there was\nsomething in it. You always refused it. When I convinced you to take a bite,\nyou Soulcast it into something else as you put it in your mouth. You said\nyou’re terrible at making organic things, and what you created was\nrevolting. But you got rid of the poison, which is why you didn’t succumb\nto it.”"

But you got rid of the poison, which is why you didn’t succumb\nto it.”\nShallan met her former mistress’s eyes. Was it the fatigue that made\nher so indifferent to the consequences of confronting this woman? Or was it\nher knowledge of the truth? “You did all that, Jasnah,” Shallan finished,\n“with a fake Soulcaster. You hadn’t spotted my swap yet. Don’t try to tell\nme otherwise. I took it on the night when you killed those three thugs.”\nJasnah’s violet eyes showed a glimmer of surprise.\n“Yes,” Shallan said, “that long ago. You didn’t replace it with a decoy.\nYou didn’t know you’d been tricked until I got out the fabrial and let you\nsave me with it. It’s all a lie, Jasnah.”\n“No,” Jasnah said. “You’re just delusional from your fatigue and the\nstress.”\n“Very well,” Shallan said. She stood up, clutching the dim sphere. “I\nguess I’ll have to show you. If I can.”\nCreatures, she said in her head. Can you hear me?\nYes, always, a whisper came in response. Though she’d hoped to hear\nit, she still jumped.\nCan you return me to that place? she asked.\nYou need to tell me something true, it replied. The more true, the\nstronger our bond.\nJasnah is using a fake Soulcaster, Shallan thought. I’m sure that’s a\ntruth.\nThat’s not enough, the voice whispered. I must know something true\nabout you. Tell me. The stronger the truth, the more hidden it is, the more\npowerful the bond. Tell me. Tell me. What are you?\n“What am I?” Shallan whispered. “Truthfully?” It was a day for\nconfrontation. She felt strangely strong, steady. Time to speak it. “I’m a\nmurderer. I killed my father.”\nAh, the voice whispered. A powerful truth indeed….\nAnd the alcove vanished.\nShallan fell, dropping into that sea of dark glass beads. She struggled,\ntrying to stay at the surface. She managed it for a moment. Then something\ntugged on her leg, pulling her down. She screamed, slipping beneath the\nsurface, tiny beads of glass filling her mouth. She panicked. She was going\nto—\nThe beads above her parted. Those beneath her surged, bearing her\nupward, out to where someone stood, hand outstretched. Jasnah, back to the\nblack sky, face lit by nearby hovering flames. Jasnah grasped Shallan’s\nhand, pulling her upward, onto something. A raft. Made from the beads of\nglass. They seemed to obey Jasnah’s will.\n“Idiot girl,” Jasnah said, waving. The oceanlike beads to the left split,\nand the raft lurched, bearing them sideways toward a few flames of light.\nJasnah shoved Shallan into one of the small flames, and she fell backward\noff the raft.\nAnd hit the floor of the alcove. Jasnah sat where she had been, eyes\nclosed. A moment later, she opened them, giving Shallan an angry look.\n“Idiot girl!” Jasnah repeated. “You have no idea how dangerous that"

The other woman still looked\nangry, but said nothing. She knows that I have her, Shallan realized. If I\nspread the truth…\nWhat would it mean? She had strange powers. Did that make Jasnah\nsome kind of Voidbringer? What would people say? No wonder she’d\ncreated the decoy.\n“I want to be part of it,” Shallan found herself saying.\n“Excuse me?”\n“Whatever you’re doing. Whatever it is you’re researching. I want to\nbe part of it.”\n“You have no idea what you’re saying.”\n“I know,” Shallan said. “I’m ignorant. There’s a simple cure for that.”\nShe stepped forward. “I want to know, Jasnah. I want to be your ward in\ntruth. Whatever the source of this thing you can do, I can do it too. I want\nyou to train me and let me be part of your work.”\n“You stole from me.”\n“I know,” Shallan said. “And I’m sorry.”\nJasnah raised an eyebrow.\n“I won’t excuse myself,” Shallan said. “But Jasnah, I came here\nintending to steal from you. I was planning it from the beginning.”\n“That’s supposed to make me feel better?”\n“I planned to steal from Jasnah the bitter heretic,” Shallan said. “I\ndidn’t realize I’d come to regret the need for that theft. Not just because of\nyou, but because it meant leaving this. What I’ve come to love. Please. I\nmade a mistake.”\n“A large one. Insurmountable.”\n“Don’t make a larger one by sending me away. I can be someone you\ndon’t have to lie to. Someone who knows.”\nJasnah sat back.\n“I stole the fabrial on the night you killed those men, Jasnah,” Shallan\nsaid. “I’d decided I couldn’t do it, but you convinced me that truth was not\nas simple as I thought it. You’ve opened a box full of storms in me. I made\na mistake. I’ll make more.

Well, you’ll need to read\nthis.” Jasnah looked down at the notes. “It’s about the Voidbringers.”\nSzeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, walked with bowed back,\ncarrying a sack of grain down off the ship and onto the docks of\nKharbranth.

The City of Bells smelled of a fresh ocean morning, peaceful\nyet excited, fishermen calling to friends as they prepared their nets.\nSzeth joined the other porters, carrying his sack through the twisting\nstreets. Perhaps another merchant might have used a chull cart, but\nKharbranth was infamous for its crowds and its steep walkways. A line of\nporters was an efficient option.\nSzeth kept his eyes down. Partially to imitate the look of a worker.\nPartially to lower his gaze from the blazing sun above, the god of gods, who\nwatched him and saw his shame. Szeth should not have been out during the\nday. He should have hidden his terrible face.\nHe felt his every step should leave a bloody footprint. The massacres\nhe’d committed these months, working for his hidden master… He could\nhear the dead scream every time he closed his eyes. They grated against his\nsoul, rubbing it to nothing, haunting him, consuming him.\nSo many dead. So very many dead.\nWas he losing his mind? Each time he went on an assassination, he\nfound himself blaming the victims. He cursed them for not being strong\nenough to fight back and kill him.\nDuring each of his slaughters, he wore white, just as he had been\ncommanded.\nOne foot in front of the other. Don’t think. Don’t focus on what you’ve\ndone. On what you’re… going to do.\nHe had reached the last name on the list: Taravangian, the king of\nKharbranth. A beloved monarch, known for building and maintaining\nhospitals in his city. It was known as far away as Azir that if you were sick,\nTaravangian would take you in. Come to Kharbranth and be healed. The\nking loved all.\nAnd Szeth was going to kill him.\nAt the top of the steep city, Szeth lugged his sack with the other porters\naround to the back of the palace structure, entering a dim stone corridor.\nTaravangian was a simpleminded man. That should have made Szeth feel\nmore guilty, but he found himself consumed by loathing. Taravangian\nwould not be smart enough to prepare for Szeth. Fool. Idiot. Would Szeth\nnever face a foe strong enough to kill him?\nSzeth had come to the city early and taken the job as a porter. He had\nneeded to research and study, for the instructions commanded him—for\nonce—not to kill anyone else in performing this assassination.\nTaravangian’s murder was to be done quietly.\nWhy the difference? The instructions stated that he was to deliver a\nmessage. “The others are dead. I’ve come to finish the job.” The\ninstructions were explicit: Make certain Taravangian heard and\nacknowledged the words before harming him.\nThis was looking like a work of vengeance. Someone had sent Szeth to\nhunt down and destroy the men who had wronged him. Szeth laid his sack\ndown in the palace larder. He turned automatically, following the shuffling\nline of porters back down the hallway. He nodded toward the servants’\nprivy, and the portermaster waved for him to go ahead.

Szeth had made this\nsame haul on several occasions, and could be trusted—presumably—to do\nhis business and catch up.\nThe privy didn’t smell half as foul as he had anticipated. It was a dark\nroom, cut into the underground cavern, but a candle burned beside a man\nstanding at the pissing trough. He nodded to Szeth, tying up the front of his\ntrousers and wiping his fingers on the sides as he walked to the door. He\ntook his candle, but kindly lit a leftover stub before withdrawing.\nAs soon as he was gone, Szeth infused himself with Stormlight from\nhis pouch and laid his hand on the door, performing a Full Lashing between\nit and the frame, locking it closed. His Shardblade came out next. In the\npalace, everything was built downward. Trusting the maps he’d purchased,\nhe knelt and carved a square of rock from the floor, wider at the bottom. As\nit began to slide down, Szeth infused it with Stormlight, performing half a\nBasic Lashing upward, making the rock weightless.\nNext, he Lashed himself upward with a subtle Lashing that left him\nweighing only a tenth his normal weight. He leapt onto the rock, and his\nlessened weight pushed the rock down slowly. He rode it down into the\nroom below. Three couches with plush violet cushions lined the walls,\nsitting beneath fine silver mirrors. The lighteyes’ privy. A lamp burned with\na small flame in the sconce, but Szeth was alone.\nThe stone thumped softly to the floor, and Szeth leaped off. He shed\nhis clothing, revealing a black and white master-servant’s outfit underneath.\nHe took a matching cap from the pocket and slipped it on, reluctantly\ndismissed his Blade, then slipped into the hallway and quickly Lashed the\ndoor shut.\nThese days, he rarely gave a thought to the fact that he walked on\nstone. Once, he would have revered a corridor of rock like this. Had that\nman once been him? Had he ever revered anything?\nSzeth hurried onward. His time was short. Fortunately, King\nTaravangian kept a strict schedule. Seventh bell: private reflection in his\nstudy. Szeth could see the doorway into the study ahead, guarded by two\nsoldiers.\nSzeth bowed his head, hiding his Shin eyes and hurrying up to them.\nOne of the men held out his hand wardingly, so Szeth grabbed it, twisting,\nshattering the wrist. He smashed his elbow into the man’s face, throwing\nhim back against the wall.\nThe man’s stunned companion opened his mouth to yell, but Szeth\nkicked him in the stomach. Even without a Shardblade, he was dangerous,\ninfused with Stormlight and trained in kammar. He grabbed the second\nguard by the hair and slammed his forehead against the rock floor. Then he\nrose and kicked open the door.\nHe walked into a room well illuminated by a double row of lamps on\nthe left. Crammed bookcases covered the right wall from floor to ceiling. A\nman sat cross-legged on a small rug directly ahead of Szeth. The man\nlooked out an enormous window cut through the rock, staring at the ocean\nbeyond.\nSzeth strode forward. “I have been instructed to tell you that the others"

He had to make certain the man acknowledged what\nhad been said. “Did you hear me?” Szeth demanded, striding forward.\n“Did you kill my guards, Szeth-son-son-Vallano?” the king asked\nquietly.\nSzeth froze. He cursed and stepped backward, raising his Blade in a\ndefensive stance. Another trap?\n“You have done your work well,” the king said, still not facing him.\n“Leaders dead, lives lost. Panic and chaos. Was this your destiny? Do you\nwonder? Given that monstrosity of a Shardblade by your people, cast out\nand absolved of any sin your masters might require of you?”\n“I am not absolved,” Szeth said, still wary. “It is a common mistake\nstone-walkers make. Each life I take weighs me down, eating away at my\nsoul.”\nThe voices… the screams… spirits below, I can hear them howling….\n“Yet you kill.”\n“It is my punishment,” Szeth said. “To kill, to have no choice, but to\nbear the sins nonetheless. I am Truthless.”\n“Truthless,” the king mused. “I would say that you know much truth.\nMore than your countrymen, now.” He finally turned to face Szeth, and\nSzeth saw that he had been wrong about this man. King Taravangian was no\nsimpleton. He had keen eyes and a wise, knowing face, rimmed with a full\nwhite beard, the mustaches drooping like arrow points. “You have seen\nwhat death and murder do to a man. You could say, Szeth-son-son-Vallano,\nthat you bear great sins for your people. You understand what they cannot.\nAnd so you have truth.”\nSzeth frowned. And then it began to make sense. He knew what would\nhappen next, even as the king reached into his voluminous sleeve and\nwithdrew a small rock that glittered in the light of two dozen lamps. “You\nwere always him,” Szeth said. “My unseen master.”\nThe king set the rock on the ground between them. Szeth’s Oathstone.\n“You put your own name on the list,” Szeth said.\n“In case you were captured,” Taravangian said. “The best defense\nagainst suspicion is to be grouped with the victims.”\n“And if I’d killed you?”\n“The instructions were explicit,” Taravangian said. “And, as we have\ndetermined, you are quite good at following them. I probably needn’t say it,\nbut I order you not to harm me. Now, did you kill my guards?”\n“I do not know,” Szeth said, forcing himself to drop to one knee and\ndismissing his Blade. He spoke loudly, trying to drown out the screams that\nhe thought—for certain—must be coming from the upper eaves of the\nroom. “I knocked them both unconscious. I believe I cracked one man’s\nskull.”\nTaravangian breathed out, sighing. He rose, stepping to the doorway."

Taravangian called for help, and other guards\narrived to see to the men.\nSzeth was left with a terrible storm of emotions. This kindly,\ncontemplative man had sent him to kill and murder? He had caused the\nscreams?\nTaravangian returned.\n“Why?” Szeth asked, voice hoarse. “Vengeance?”\n“No.” Taravangian sounded very tired. “Some of those men you killed\nwere my dear friends, Szeth-son-son-Vallano.”\n“More insurance?” Szeth spat. “To keep yourself from suspicion?”\n“In part. And in part because their deaths were necessary.”\n“Why?” Szeth asked. “What could it possibly have served?”\n“Stability. Those you killed were among the most powerful and\ninfluential men in Roshar.”\n“How does that help stability?”\n“Sometimes,” Taravangian said, “you must tear down a structure to\nbuild a new one with stronger walls.” He turned around, looking out over\nthe ocean. “And we are going to need strong walls in the coming years.\nVery, very strong walls.”\n“Your words are like the hundred doves.”\n“Easy to release, difficult to keep,” Taravangian said, speaking the\nwords in Shin.\nSzeth looked up sharply. This man spoke the Shin language and knew\nhis people’s proverbs? Odd to find in a stonewalker. Odder to find in a\nmurderer.\n“Yes, I speak your language. Sometimes I wonder if the Lifebrother\nhimself sent you to me.”\n“To bloody myself so that you wouldn’t have to,” Szeth said. “Yes,\nthat sounds like something one of your Vorin gods would do.”\nTaravangian fell quiet. “Get up,” he finally said.\nSzeth obeyed. He would always obey his master. Taravangian led him\nto a door set into the side of the study. The aged man pulled a sphere lamp\noff the wall, lighting a winding stairwell of deep, narrow steps. They\nfollowed it and eventually came to a landing. Taravangian pushed open\nanother door and entered a large room that wasn’t on any of the palace\nmaps that Szeth had purchased or bribed a look at. It was long, with wide\nrailings on the sides, giving it a terraced look. Everything was painted\nwhite.\nIt was filled with beds. Hundreds and hundreds of them. Many were\noccupied.\nSzeth followed the king, frowning. An enormous hidden room, cut into\nthe stone of the Conclave? People bustled about wearing coats of white. “A\nhospital?” Szeth said. “You expect me to find your humanitarian eff orts a\nredemption for what you have commanded of me?”\n“This is not humanitarian work,” Taravangian said, walking forward\nslowly, white-and-orange robes rustling. Those they passed bowed to him\nwith reverence. Taravangian led Szeth to an alcove of beds, each with a\nsickly person in it. There were healers working on them. Doing something\nto their arms."

What?\n“I don’t understand,” Szeth said, watching in horror as the four\npatients grew pale. “You’re killing them, aren’t you?”\n“Yes. We don’t need the blood; it is merely a way to kill slowly and\neasily.”\n“Every one of them? The people in this room?”\n“We try to select only the worst cases to move here, for once they are\nbrought to this place, we cannot let them leave if they begin to recover.” He\nturned to Szeth, eyes sorrowful. “Sometimes we need more bodies than the\nterminally sick can provide. And so we must bring the forgotten and the\nlowly. Those who will not be missed.”\nSzeth couldn’t speak. He couldn’t voice his horror and revulsion. In\nfront of him, one of the victims—a man in his younger years—expired. Two\nof those remaining were children. Szeth stepped forward. He had to stop\nthis. He had to—\n“You will still yourself,” Taravangian said. “And you will return to my\nside.”\nSzeth did as his master commanded. What were a few more deaths?\nJust another set of screams to haunt him. He could hear them now, coming\nfrom beneath beds, behind furniture.\nOr I could kill him, Szeth thought. I could stop this.\nHe nearly did it. But honor prevailed, for the moment.\n“You see, Szeth-son-son-Vallano,” Taravangian said. “I did not send\nyou to do my bloody work for me. I do it here, myself. I have personally\nheld the knife and released the blood from the veins of many. Much like\nyou, I know I cannot escape my sins. We are two men of one heart. This is\none reason why I sought you out.”\n“But why?” Szeth said.\nOn the beds, a dying youth started speaking. One of the women with\nthe clipboards stepped forward quickly, recording the words.\n“The day was ours, but they took it,” the boy cried. “Stormfather! You\ncannot have it. The day is ours. They come, rasping, and the lights fail. Oh,\nStormfather!” The boy arched his back, then fell still suddenly, eyes dead.\nThe king turned to Szeth. “It is better for one man to sin than for a\npeople to be destroyed, wouldn’t you say, Szeth-son-son-Vallano?”\n“I…”\n“We do not know why some speak when others do not,” Taravangian\nsaid. “But the dying see something. It began seven years ago, about the time\nwhen King Gavilar was investigating the Shattered Plains for the first time.”\nHis eyes grew distant. “It is coming, and these people see it. On that bridge\nbetween life and the endless ocean of death, they view something. Their\nwords might save us.”\n“You are a monster.”\n“Yes,” Taravangian said. “But I am the monster who will save this\nworld.” He looked at Szeth. “I have a name to add to your list. I had hoped"

I had hoped\nto avoid doing this, but recent events have made it inevitable. I cannot let\nhim seize control. It will undermine everything.”\n“Who?” Szeth asked, wondering if anything at all could horrify him\nfurther.\n“Dalinar Kholin,” Taravangian said. “I’m afraid it must be done\nquickly, before he can unite the Alethi highprinces. You will go to the\nShattered Plains and end him.” He hesitated. “It must be done brutally, I’m\nafraid.”\n“I have rarely had the luxury of working otherwise,” Szeth said,\nclosing his eyes.\nThe screams greeted him.\n“Before I read,” Shallan said, “I need to understand something. You\nSoulcast my blood, didn’t you?”\n“To remove the poison,” Jasnah said. “Yes. It acted extremely quickly;\nas I said, it must have been a very concentrated form of the powder. I had to\nSoulcast your blood several times as we got you to vomit. Your body\ncontinued to absorb the poison.”\n“But you said you aren’t good with organics,” Shallan said. “You\nturned the strawberry jam into something inedible.”\n“Blood isn’t the same,” Jasnah said, waving her hand. “It’s one of the\nEssences. You’ll learn this, should I actually decide to teach you\nSoulcasting. For now, know that the pure form of an Essence is quite easy\nto make; the eight kinds of blood are easier to create than water, for\ninstance. Creating something as complex as strawberry jam, however—a\nmush made from a fruit I’d never before tasted or smelled—was well\nbeyond my abilities.”\n“And the ardents,” Shallan said. “Those who Soulcast? Do they\nactually use fabrials, or is it all a hoax?”\n“No, Soulcasting fabrials are real. Quite real. So far as I know,\neveryone else who does what I—what we—can do uses a fabrial to\naccomplish it.”\n“What of the creatures with the symbol heads?” Shallan asked. She\nflipped through her sketches, then held up an image of them. “Do you see\nthem too? How are they related?”\nJasnah frowned, taking the image. “You see beings like this? In\nShadesmar?”\n“They appear in my drawings,” Shallan said. “They’re around me,\nJasnah. You don’t see them? Am I—”\nJasnah held up a hand. “These are a type of spren, Shallan. They are\nrelated to what you do.” She tapped the desk softly. “Two orders of the\nKnights Radiant possessed inherent Soulcasting ability; it was based on\ntheir powers that the original fabrials were designed, I believe. I had\nassumed that you… But no, that obviously wouldn’t make sense. I see\nnow.”\n“What?”\n“I will explain as I train you,” Jasnah said, handing back the sheet.\n“You will need a greater foundation before you can grasp it. Suffice it to say\nthat each Radiant’s abilities were tied to the spren.”"

Suffice it to say\nthat each Radiant’s abilities were tied to the spren.”\n“Wait, Radiants? But—”\n“I will explain,” Jasnah said. “But first, we must speak of the\nVoidbringers.”\nShallan nodded. “You think they’ll return, don’t you?”\nJasnah studied her. “What makes you say that?”\n“The legends say the Voidbringers came a hundred times to try to\ndestroy mankind,” Shallan continued. “I… read some of your notes.”\n“You what?”\n“I was looking for information on Soulcasting,” Shallan confessed.\nJasnah sighed. “Well, I suppose it is the least of your crimes.”\n“I can’t understand,” Shallan said. “Why are you bothering with these\nstories of myths and shadows? Other scholars—scholars I know you respect\n—consider the Voidbringers to be a fabrication. Yet you chase stories from\nrural farmers and write them down in your notebook. Why, Jasnah? Why do\nyou have faith in this when you reject things that are so much more\nplausible?”\nJasnah looked over her sheets of paper. “Do you know the real\ndifference between me and a believer, Shallan?”\nShallan shook her head.\n“It strikes me that religion—in its essence—seeks to take natural\nevents and ascribe supernatural causes to them. I, however, seek to take\nsupernatural events and find the natural meanings behind them. Perhaps\nthat is the final dividing line between science and religion. Opposite sides of\na card.”\n“So… you think…”\n“The Voidbringers had a natural, real-world correlate,” Jasnah said\nfirmly. “I’m certain of it. Something caused the legends.”\n“What was it?”\nJasnah handed Shallan a page of notes. “These are the best I’ve been\nable to find. Read them. Tell me what you think.”\nShallan scanned the page. Some of the quotes—or at least the concepts\n—were familiar to her from what she’d read already.\nSuddenly dangerous. Like a calm day that became a tempest.\n“They were real,” Jasnah repeated.\nBeings of ash and fire.\n“We fought with them,” Jasnah said. “We fought so often that men\nbegan to speak of the creatures in metaphor. A hundred battles—ten\ntenfolds…”\nFlame and char. Skin so terrible. Eyes like pits of blackness. Music\nwhen they kill.\n“We defeated them…” Jasnah said.\nShallan felt a chill.\n“…but the legends lie about one thing,” Jasnah continued. “They claim\nwe chased the Voidbringers off the face of Roshar or destroyed them. But\nthat’s not how humans work. We don’t throw away something we can use.”\nShallan rose, walking to the edge of the balcony, looking out at the lift,\nwhich was slowly being lowered by its two porters.\nParshmen. With skin of black and red.\nAsh and fire.\n“Stormfather…” Shallan whispered, horrified.\n“We didn’t destroy the Voidbringers,” Jasnah said from behind, her\nvoice haunted. “We enslaved them.”\nThe chill spring weather might finally have slipped back into summer.

        "text": "“We didn’t destroy the Voidbringers,” Jasnah said from behind, her\nvoice haunted. “We enslaved them.”\nThe chill spring weather might finally have slipped back into summer. It\nwas still cool at night, but not uncomfortably so. Kaladin stood on Dalinar\nKholin’s staging ground, looking eastward over the Shattered Plains.\nEver since the failed betrayal and subsequent rescue earlier, Kaladin\nhad found himself nervous. Freedom. Bought with a Shardblade. It seemed\nimpossible. His every life experience taught him to expect a trap.\nHe clasped his hands behind him; Syl sat on his shoulder.\n“Dare I trust him?” he asked softly.\n“He’s a good man,” Syl said. “I’ve watched him. Despite that thing he\ncarried.”\n“That thing?”\n“The Shardblade.”\n“What do you care about it?”\n“I don’t know,” she said, wrapping her arms around herself. “It just\nfeels wrong to me. I hate it. I’m glad he got rid of it. Makes him a better\nman.”\nNomon, the middle moon, began to rise. Bright and pale blue, bathing\nthe horizon in light. Somewhere, out across the Plains, was the Parshendi\nShardbearer that Kaladin had fought. He’d stabbed the man in the leg from\nbehind. The watching Parshendi had not interfered with the duel and had\navoided attacking Kaladin’s wounded bridgemen, but Kaladin had attacked\none of their champions from the most cowardly position possible,\ninterfering with a fight.\nHe was bothered by what he’d done, and that frustrated him. A warrior\ncouldn’t worry about who he attacked or how. Survival was the only rule of\nthe battlefield.\nWell, survival and loyalty. And he sometimes let wounded enemies\nlive if they weren’t a threat. And he saved young soldiers who needed\nprotection. And…\nAnd he’d never been good at doing what a warrior should.\nToday, he’d saved a highprince—another lighteyes—and along with\nhim thousands of soldiers. Saved them by killing Parshendi.\n“Can you kill to protect?” Kaladin asked out loud. “Is that a self-\ncontradiction?”\n“I… I don’t know.”\n“You acted strangely in the battle,” Kaladin said. “Swirling around me.\nAfter that, you left. I didn’t see much of you.”\n“The killing,” she said softly. “It hurt me. I had to go.”\n“Yet you’re the one who prompted me to go and save Dalinar. You\nwanted me to return and kill.”\n“I know.”\n“Teft said that the Radiants held to a standard,” Kaladin said. “He said\nthat by their rules, you shouldn’t do terrible things to accomplish great ones.\nYet what did I do today? Slaughter Parshendi in order to save Alethi. What\nof that? They aren’t innocent, but neither are we. Not by a faint breeze or a\nstormwind.”\nSyl didn’t reply.\n“If I hadn’t gone to save Dalinar’s men,” Kaladin said, “I would have\nallowed Sadeas to commit a terrible betrayal. I’d have let men die who I\ncould have saved. I’d have been sick and disgusted with myself. I also lost\nthree good men, bridgemen who were mere breaths away from freedom."

        "text": "could have saved. I’d have been sick and disgusted with myself. I also lost\nthree good men, bridgemen who were mere breaths away from freedom.\nAre the lives of the others worth that?”\n“I don’t have the answers, Kaladin.”\n“Does anyone?”\nFootsteps came from behind. Syl turned. “It’s him.”\nThe moon had just risen. Dalinar Kholin, it appeared, was a punctual\nman.\nHe stepped up beside Kaladin. He carried a bundle under his arm, and\nhe had a military air about him, even without his Shardplate on. In fact, he\nwas more impressive without it. His muscular build indicated that he did\nnot rely on his Plate to give him strength, and the neatly pressed uniform\nindicated a man who understood that others were inspired when their leader\nlooked the part.\nOthers have looked just as noble, Kaladin thought. But would any man\ntrade a Shardblade just to keep up appearances? And if they would, at what\npoint did the appearance become reality?\n“I’m sorry to make you meet me so late,” Dalinar said. “I know it has\nbeen a long day.”\n“I doubt I could have slept anyway.”\nDalinar grunted softly, as if he understood. “Your men are seen to?”\n“Yes,” Kaladin said. “Quite well, actually. Thank you.” Kaladin had\nbeen given empty barracks for the bridgemen and they had received\nmedical attention from Dalinar’s best surgeons—they’d gotten it before the\nwounded lighteyed officers had. The other bridgemen, the ones who weren’t\nfrom Bridge Four, had accepted Kaladin immediately, without any\ndeliberation on the matter, as their leader.\nDalinar nodded. “How many, do you suspect, will take my offer of a\npurse and freedom?”\n“A fair number of the men from other crews will. But I’ll wager an\neven larger number won’t. Bridgemen don’t think of escape or freedom.\nThey wouldn’t know what to do with themselves. As for my own crew…\nWell, I have a feeling that they’ll insist on doing whatever I do. If I stay,\nthey’ll stay. If I go, they’ll go.”\nDalinar nodded. “And what will you do?”\n“I haven’t decided yet.”\n“I spoke to my officers.” Dalinar grimaced. “The ones who survived.\nThey said that you gave orders to them, took charge like a lighteyes. My\nson still feels bitter about the way your… conversation with him went.”\n“Even a fool could see he wasn’t going to be able to get to you. As for\nthe officers, most were in shock or run ragged. I merely nudged them.”\n“I owe you my life twice over,” Dalinar said. “And that of my son and\nmy men.”\n“You paid that debt.”\n“No,” Dalinar said. “But I’ve done what I can.” He eyed Kaladin, as if\nsizing him up, judging him. “Why did your bridge crew come for us? Why,\nreally?”\n“Why did you give up your Shardblade?”\nDalinar held his eyes, then nodded. “Fair enough. I have an offer for\nyou. The king and I are about to do something very, very dangerous.\nSomething that will upset all the warcamps.”\n“Congratulations.”"

        "text": "you. The king and I are about to do something very, very dangerous.\nSomething that will upset all the warcamps.”\n“Congratulations.”\nDalinar smiled faintly. “My honor guard has nearly been wiped out,\nand the men I do have are needed to augment the King’s Guard. My trust is\nstretched thin these days. I need someone to protect me and my family. I\nwant you and your men for that job.”\n“You want a bunch of bridgemen as bodyguards?”\n“The elite ones as bodyguards,” Dalinar said. “Those in your crew, the\nones you trained. I want the rest as soldiers for my army. I have heard how\nwell your men fought. You trained them without Sadeas’s knowing, all\nwhile running bridges. I’m curious to see what you could do with the right\nresources.” Dalinar turned away, glancing northward. Toward Sadeas’s\ncamp. “My army is depleted. I’m going to need every man I can get, but\neveryone I recruit is going to be suspect. Sadeas will try to send spies into\nour camp. And traitors. And assassins. Elhokar thinks we won’t last a\nweek.”\n“Stormfather,” Kaladin said. “What are you planning?”\n“I’m going to take away their games, fully expecting them to react like\nchildren losing their favored toy.”\n“These children have armies and Shardblades.”\n“Unfortunately.”\n“And this is what you want me to protect you from?”\n“Yes.”\nNo quibbling. Straightforward. There was much to respect about that.\n“I’ll augment Bridge Four to become the honor guard,” Kaladin said.\n“And train the rest as a spearman company. Those in the honor guard get\npaid like it.” Generally, a lighteyes’s personal guard got triple a standard\nspearman’s wage.\n“Of course.”\n“And I want space to train,” Kaladin said. “Full right of requisition\nfrom the quartermasters. I get to set my men’s schedule, and we appoint our\nown sergeants and squadleaders. We don’t answer to any lighteyes but\nyourself, your sons, and the king.”\nDalinar raised an eyebrow. “That last one is a little… irregular.”\n“You want me to guard you and your family?” Kaladin said. “Against\nthe other highprinces and their assassins, who might infiltrate your army\nand your officers? Well, I can’t be in a position where any lighteyes in the\ncamp can order me around, now can I?”\n“You have a point,” Dalinar said. “You realize, however, that in doing\nthis I would essentially be giving you the same authority as a lighteyes of\nfourth dahn. You’d be in charge of a thousand former bridgemen. A full\nbattalion.”\n“Yes.”\nDalinar thought for a moment. “Very well. Consider yourself\nappointed to the rank of captain—that’s as high as I dare appoint a\ndarkeyes. If I named you battalionlord, it would cause a whole mess of\nproblems. I’ll let it be known, however, that you’re outside the chain of\ncommand. You don’t order around lighteyes of lesser rank than you, and\nlighteyes of higher rank have no authority over you.”\n“All right,” Kaladin said. “But these soldiers I train, I want them"

You don’t order around lighteyes of lesser rank than you, and\nlighteyes of higher rank have no authority over you.”\n“All right,” Kaladin said. “But these soldiers I train, I want them\nassigned to patrolling, not plateau runs. I hear you’ve had several full\nbattalions hunting bandits, keeping the peace in the Outer Market, that sort\nof thing. That’s where my men go for one year, at least.”\n“Easy enough,” Dalinar said. “You want time to train them before\nthrowing them into battle, I assume.”\n“That, and I killed a lot of Parshendi today. I found myself regretting\ntheir deaths. They showed me more honor than most members of my own\narmy have. I didn’t like the feeling, and I want some time to think about it.\nThe bodyguards I train for you, we’ll go out onto the field, but our primary\npurpose will be protecting you, not killing Parshendi.”\nDalinar looked bemused. “All right. Though you shouldn’t have to\nworry. I don’t plan to be on the front lines much in the future. My role is\nchanging. Regardless, we have a deal.”\nKaladin held out a hand. “This is contingent on my men agreeing.”\n“I thought you said that they’d do what you did.”\n“Probably,” Kaladin said. “I command them, but I don’t own them.”\nDalinar reached out, taking his hand, shaking it by the light of the\nrising sapphire moon. Then he took the bundle out from underneath his arm.\n“Here.”\n“What is this?” Kaladin said, taking the bundle.\n“My cloak. The one I wore to battle today, washed and patched.”\nKaladin unfurled it. It was of a deep blue, with the glyphpair of khokh\nand linil sewn into the back in white embroidery.\n“Each man who wears my colors,” Dalinar said, “is of my family, in a\nway. The cloak is a simple gift, but it is one of the few things I can offer\nthat has any meaning. Accept it with my gratitude, Kaladin Stormblessed.”\nKaladin slowly refolded the cloak. “Where did you hear that name?”\n“Your men,” Dalinar said. “They think very highly of you. And that\nmakes me think very highly of you. I need men like you, like all of you.”\nHe narrowed his eyes, looking thoughtful. “The whole kingdom needs you.\nPerhaps all of Roshar. The True Desolation comes….”\n“What was that last part?”\n“Nothing,” Dalinar said. “Please, go get some rest, Captain. I hope to\nhear good news from you soon.”\nKaladin nodded and withdrew, passing the two men who acted as\nDalinar’s guard for the night. The hike back to his new barracks was a short\none. Dalinar had given him one building for each of the bridge crews. Over\na thousand men. What was he going to do with so many? He’d never\ncommanded a group larger than twenty-five before.\nBridge Four’s barrack was empty. Kaladin hesitated outside the\ndoorway, looking in.

Frowning, he rounded the barrack to find the men\nsitting around a firepit in the back, relaxing on stumps or stones, waiting as\nRock cooked them a pot of stew. They were listening to Teft, who sat with\nhis arm bandaged, speaking quietly. Shen was there; the quiet parshman sat\nat the very edge of the group. They’d recovered him, along with their\nwounded, from Sadeas’s camp.\nTeft cut off as soon as he saw Kaladin, and the men turned, most of\nthem bearing bandages of some sort. Dalinar wants these for his\nbodyguards? Kaladin thought. They were a ragged bunch indeed.\nAs it happened, however, he seconded Dalinar’s choice. If he were\ngoing to put his life in someone’s hands, he’d choose this group.\n“What are you doing?” Kaladin asked sternly. “You should all be\nresting.”\nThe bridgemen glanced at each other.\n“It just…” Moash said. “It didn’t feel right to go to sleep until we’d\nhad a chance to… well, do this.”\n“Hard to sleep on a day like this, gancho,” Lopen added.\n“Speak for yourself,” Skar said, yawning, wounded leg resting up on a\nstump. “But the stew is worth staying up for. Even if he does put rocks in\nit.”\n“I do not!” Rock snapped. “Airsick lowlanders.”\nThey’d left a place for Kaladin. He sat down, using Dalinar’s cloak as\na cushion for his back and head. He gratefully took a bowl of stew that\nDrehy handed him.\n“We’ve been talking about what the men saw today,” Teft said. “The\nthings you did.”\nKaladin hesitated, spoon to his mouth. He’d nearly forgotten—or\nmaybe he’d intentionally forgotten—that he’d shown his men what he could\ndo with Stormlight. Hopefully Dalinar’s soldiers hadn’t seen. His\nStormlight had been faint by then, the day bright.\n“I see,” Kaladin said, his appetite fleeing. Did they see him as\ndifferent? Frightening? Something to be ostracized, as his father had been\nback in Hearthstone? Worse yet, something to be worshipped? He looked\ninto their wide eyes and braced himself.\n“It was amazing!” Drehy said, leaning forward.\n“You’re one of the Radiants,” Skar said, pointing. “I believe it, even if\nTeft says you aren’t.”\n“He isn’t yet,” Teft snapped. “Don’t you listen?”\n“Can you teach me to do what you did?” Moash cut in.\n“I’ll learn too, gancho,” Lopen said. “You know, if you’re teaching and\nall.”\nKaladin blinked, overwhelmed, as the others chimed in.\n“What can you do?”\n“How does it feel?”\n“Can you fly?’\nHe held up a hand, stanching the questions. “Aren’t you alarmed by\nwhat you saw?”\nSeveral of the men shrugged.\n“It kept you alive, gancho,” Lopen said. “The only thing I’d be\nalarmed about is how irresistible the women would find it. ‘Lopen,’ they’d"

I think that you\nshould kiss me now.’”\n“But it’s strange and frightening,” Kaladin protested. “This is what the\nRadiants did! Everyone knows they were traitors.”\n“Yeah,” Moash said, snorting. “Just like everyone knows that the light-\neyes are chosen by the Almighty to rule, and how they’re always noble and\njust.”\n“We’re Bridge Four,” Skar added. “We’ve been around. We’ve lived in\nthe crem and been used as bait. If it helps you survive, it’s good. That’s all\nthat needs to be said about it.”\n“So can you teach it?” Moash asked. “Can you show us how to do\nwhat you do?”\n“I… I don’t know if it can be taught,” Kaladin said, glancing at Syl,\nwho bore a curious expression as she sat on a nearby rock. “I’m not certain\nwhat it is.”\nThey looked crestfallen.\n“But,” Kaladin added, “that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t try.”\nMoash smiled.\n“Can you do it?” Drehy asked, fishing out a sphere, a small glowing\ndiamond chip. “Right now? I want to see it when I’m expecting it.”\n“It’s not a feastday sport, Drehy,” Kaladin said.\n“Don’t you think we deserve it?” Sigzil leaned forward on his stone.\nKaladin paused. Then, hesitantly, he reached out a finger and touched\nthe sphere. He inhaled sharply; drawing in the Light was becoming more\nand more natural. The sphere faded. Stormlight began to trickle from\nKaladin’s skin, and he breathed normally to make it leak faster, making it\nmore visible. Rock pulled out a ragged old blanket—used for kindling—\nand tossed it over the fire, disturbing the flamespren and making a few\nmoments of darkness before the flames chewed through.\nIn that darkness, Kaladin glowed, pure white Light rising from his\nskin.\n“Storms…” Drehy breathed.\n“So, what can you do with it?” Skar asked, eager. “You didn’t answer.”\n“I’m not entirely certain what I can do,” Kaladin said, holding his hand\nup in front of him. It faded in a moment, and the fire burned through the\nblanket, lighting them all again. “I’ve only known about it for sure for a few\nweeks. I can draw arrows toward me and can make rocks stick together. The\nLight makes me stronger and faster, and it heals my wounds.”\n“How much stronger does it make you?” Sigzil said. “How much\nweight can the rocks bear after you stick them together, and how long do\nthey remain bonded? How much faster do you get? Twice as fast? A quarter\nagain as fast? How far away can an arrow be when you draw it toward you,\nand can you draw other things as well?”\nKaladin blinked. “I… I don’t know.”\n“Well, it seems pretty important to know that kind of stuff,” Skar said,\nrubbing his chin."

For\nhim only.”\n“You don’t know that for certain,” Teft said.\n“You don’t know for certain I don’t know for certain.” Rock wagged a\nspoon at him. “Eat your stew.”\nKaladin held up his hands. “You can’t tell anyone about this, men.\nThey’ll be frightened of me, maybe think I’m related to the Voidbringers or\nthe Radiants. I need your oaths on this.”\nHe looked at them, and they nodded, one by one.\n“But we want to help,” Skar said. “Even if we can’t learn it. This thing\nis part of you, and you’re one of us. Bridge Four. Right?”\nKaladin looked at their eager faces and couldn’t stop himself from\nnodding. “Yes. Yes, you can help.”\n“Excellent,” Sigzil said. “I’ll prepare a list of tests to gauge speed,\naccuracy, and the strength of these bonds you can create. We’ll have to find\na way to determine if there’s anything else you can do.”\n“Throw him off cliff,” Rock said.\n“What good will that do?” Peet asked.\nRock shrugged. “If he has other abilities, this thing will make them\ncome out, eh? Nothing like falling from cliff to make a man out of a boy!”\nKaladin regarded him with a sour expression, and Rock laughed. “It\nwill be small cliff.” He held up his thumb and forefinger to indicate a tiny\namount. “I like you too much for large one.”\n“I think you’re joking,” Kaladin said, taking a bite of his stew. “But\njust to be safe, I’m sticking you to the ceiling tonight to keep you from\ntrying any experiments while I’m asleep.”\nThe bridgemen chuckled.\n“Just don’t glow too brightly while we’re trying to sleep, eh, gancho?”\nLopen said.\n“I’ll do my best.” He took another spoonful of stew. It tasted better\nthan usual. Had Rock changed the recipe?\nOr was it something else? As he settled back to eat, the other\nbridgemen began chatting, speaking of home and their pasts, things that had\nonce been taboo. Several of the men from other crews—wounded whom\nKaladin had helped, even just a few lonely souls who were still awake—\nwandered over. The men of Bridge Four welcomed them, handing over stew\nand making room.\nEveryone looked as exhausted as Kaladin felt, but nobody spoke of\nturning in. He could see why, now. Being together, eating Rock’s stew,\nlistening to the quiet chatter while the fire crackled and popped, sending\ndancing flakes of yellow light into the air…\nThis was more relaxing than sleep could be. Kaladin smiled, leaning\nback, looking upward toward the dark sky and the large sapphire moon.\nThen he closed his eyes, listening."

Kaladin smiled, leaning\nback, looking upward toward the dark sky and the large sapphire moon.\nThen he closed his eyes, listening.\nThree more men were dead. Malop, Earless Jaks, and Narm. Kaladin\nhad failed them. But he and Bridge Four had protected hundreds of others.\nHundreds who would never have to run a bridge again, would never have to\nface Parshendi arrows, would never have to fight again if they didn’t want\nto. More personally, twenty-seven of his friends lived. Partially because of\nwhat he’d done, partially because of their own heroism.\nTwenty-seven men lived. He’d finally managed to save someone.\nFor now, that was enough.\nShallan rubbed her eyes. She’d read through Jasnah’s notes—at least the\nmost important ones. Those alone had made a large stack. She still sat in the\nalcove, though they’d sent a parshman to get her a blanket to wrap around\nherself, covering up the hospital robe.\nHer eyes burned from the night spent crying, then reading. She was\nexhausted. And yet she also felt alive.\n“It’s true,” she said. “You’re right. The Voidbringers are the parshmen.\nI can see no other conclusion.”\nJasnah smiled, looking oddly pleased with herself, considering that\nshe’d only convinced one person.\n“So what next?” Shallan asked.\n“That has to do with your previous studies.”\n“My studies? You mean your father’s death?”\n“Indeed.”\n“The Parshendi attacked him,” Shallan said. “Killed him suddenly,\nwithout warning.” She focused on the other woman. “That’s what made you\nbegin studying all of this, isn’t it?”\nJasnah nodded. “Those wild parshmen—the Parshendi of the Shattered\nPlains—are the key.” She leaned forward. “Shallan. The disaster awaiting\nus is all too real, all too terrible. I don’t need mystical warnings or\ntheological sermons to frighten me. I’m downright terrified in my own\nright.”\n“But we have the parshmen tamed.”\n“Do we? Shallan, think of what they do, how they’re regarded, how\noften they’re used.”\nShallan hesitated. The parshmen were pervasive.\n“They serve our food,” Jasnah continued. “They work our storehouses.\nThey tend our children. There isn’t a village in Roshar that doesn’t have\nsome parshmen. We ignore them; we just expect them to be there, doing as\nthey do. Working without complaint.\n“Yet one group turned suddenly from peaceful friends to slaughtering\nwarriors. Something set them off. Just as it did hundreds of years ago,\nduring the days known as the Heraldic Epochs. There would be a period of\npeace, followed by an invasion of parshmen who—for reasons nobody\nunderstood—had suddenly gone mad with anger and rage. This was what\nwas behind mankind’s fight to keep from being ‘banished to Damnation.’\nThis was what nearly ended our civilization. This was the terrible, repeated\ncataclysm that was so frightening men began to speak of them as\nDesolations.\n“We’ve nurtured the parshmen. We’ve integrated them into every part"

We depend on them, never realizing that we’ve harnessed a\nhighstorm waiting to explode. The accounts from the Shattered Plains speak\nof these Parshendi’s ability to communicate among themselves, allowing\nthem to sing their songs in unison when far apart. Their minds are\nconnected, like spanreeds. Do you realize what that means?”\nShallan nodded. What would happen if every parshman on Roshar\nsuddenly turned against his masters? Seeking freedom, or worse—\nvengeance? “We’d be devastated. Civilization as we know it could collapse.\nWe have to do something!”\n“We are,” Jasnah said. “We’re gathering facts, making certain we\nknow what we think we know.”\n“And how many facts do we need?”\n“More. Many more.” Jasnah glanced at the books. “There are some\nthings about the histories I don’t yet understand. Tales of creatures fighting\nalongside the parshmen, beasts of stone that might be some kind of\ngreatshell, and other oddities that I think may have truth to them. But we’ve\nexhausted what Kharbranth can offer. Are you still certain you want to\ndelve into this? It is a heavy burden we will bear.

Damnation—it’s bigger than me or you or any\nof us. I have to help, Jasnah. I can’t walk out on this. I’ll find some other\nway to help my family.”\n“Good. Then go pack our things. We’re leaving tomorrow on that ship\nI chartered for you.”\n“We’re going to Jah Keved?”\n“No. We need to get to the center of it all.” She looked at Shallan.\n“We’re going to the Shattered Plains. We need to find out if the Parshendi\nwere ever ordinary parshmen, and if so, what set them off. Perhaps I am\nwrong about this, but if I am right, then the Parshendi could hold the key to\nturning ordinary parshmen into soldiers.” Then, grimly, she continued.\n“And we need to do it before someone else does, then uses it against us.”\n“Someone else?” Shallan asked, feeling a sharp stab of panic. “There\nare others looking for this?”\n“Of course there are. Who do you think went to so much trouble trying\nto have me assassinated?” She reached into a stack of papers on her desk. “I\ndon’t know much about them. For all I know, there are many groups\nsearching for these secrets. I know of one for certain, however. They call\nthemselves the Ghostbloods.” She pulled out a sheet. “Your friend Kabsal\nwas one.

On it was a symbol of three diamonds in a\npattern, overlapping one another.\nIt was the same symbol that Nan Balat had shown her weeks ago. The\nsymbol worn by Luesh, her father’s steward, the man who had known how\nto use the Soulcaster. The symbol worn by the men who had come,\npressuring her family to return it. The men who had been financing\nShallan’s father in his bid to become highprince.\n“Almighty above,” Shallan whispered. She looked up. “Jasnah, I\nthink… I think my father might have been a member of this group.”\nThe highstorm winds began to blow against Dalinar’s complex, powerful\nenough to make rocks groan. Navani huddled close to Dalinar, holding to\nhim. She smelled wonderful. It felt… humbling to know how terrified she’d\nbeen for him.\nHer joy at having him back was enough to dampen, for now, her fury\nat him for how he’d treated Elhokar. She would come around. It had needed\nto be done.\nAs the highstorm hit in force, Dalinar felt the vision coming on. He\nclosed his eyes, letting it take him. He had a decision to make, a\nresponsibility. What to do? These visions had lied to him, or had at least\nmisled him. It seemed that he couldn’t trust them, at least not as explicitly\nas he once had.\nHe took a deep breath, opened his eyes, and found himself in a place\nof smoke.\nHe turned about, wary. The sky was dark and he stood on a field of\ndull, bone-white rock, jagged and rough, extending in all directions. Off\ninto eternity. Amorphous shapes made of curling grey smoke rose from the\nground. Like smoke rings, only in other shapes. Here a chair. There a\nrockbud, with vines extended, curling to the sides and vanishing. Beside\nhim appeared the figure of a man in uniform, silent and vaporous, rising\nlethargically toward the sky, mouth open. The shapes melted and distorted\nas they climbed higher, though they seemed to hold their forms longer than\nthey should. It was unnerving, standing on the eternal plain, pure darkness\nabove, smoke figures rising all around.\nIt wasn’t like any vision he’d seen before. It was…\nNo, wait. He frowned, stepping back as the figure of a tree burst from\nthe ground close to him. I have seen this place before. In the first of my\nvisions, so many months ago. It was fuzzy in his mind. He’d been\ndisoriented, the vision vague, as if his mind hadn’t learned to accept what it\nwas seeing. In fact, the only thing he remembered distinctly was—\n“You must unite them,” a strong voice boomed.\n—was the voice. Speaking to him from all around, causing the smoke\nfigures to fuzz and distort.\n“Why did you lie to me?” Dalinar demanded of the open darkness. “I\ndid what you said, and I was betrayed!”\n“Unite them. The sun approaches the horizon. The Everstorm comes.\nThe True Desolation. The Night of Sorrows.”\n“I need answers!” Dalinar said. “I don’t trust you any longer. If you"

If you\nwant me to listen to you, you’ll need to—”\nThe vision changed. He spun about, finding that he was still on an\nopen plain of rock, but the normal sun was in the sky. The stone field\nlooked like an ordinary one on Roshar.\nIt was very odd for one of the visions to set him in a place without\nothers to talk to and interact with. Though, for once, he wore his own\nclothing. The sharp blue Kholin uniform.\nHad this happened before, the other time he’d been in that place of\nsmoke? Yes… it had. This was the first time he’d been taken to a place\nwhere he’d been before. Why?\nHe carefully scanned the scenery. Since the voice didn’t speak to him\nagain, he began to walk, passing cracked boulders and broken bits of shale,\npebbles and rocks. There were no plants, not even rockbuds. Just an empty\nlandscape filled with broken stones.\nEventually, he spotted a ridge. Getting to high ground felt like a good\nidea, though the hike seemed to take hours. The vision did not end. Time\nwas often odd in these visions. He continued to hike up the side of the rock\nformation, wishing he had his Shardplate to strengthen him. Finally at the\ntop, he walked over to the edge to look down below.\nAnd there he saw Kholinar, his home, the capital city of Alethkar.\nIt had been destroyed.\nThe beautiful buildings had been shattered. The windblades were cast\ndown. There were no bodies, just broken stone. This wasn’t like the vision\nhe had seen before, with Nohadon. That wasn’t the Kholinar of the distant\npast; he could see the rubble of his own palace. But there was no rock\nformation like the one he stood on near Kholinar in the real world. Always\nbefore, these visions had shown him the past. Was this now a vision of the\nfuture?\n“I cannot fight him any longer,” the voice said.\nDalinar jumped, glancing to the side. A man stood there. He had dark\nskin and pure white hair. Tall, thick of chest but not massive, he wore exotic\nclothing of a strange cut: loose, billowing trousers and a coat that came\ndown only to his waist. Both seemed made of gold.\nYes… this very thing had happened before, in his very first vision.\nDalinar could remember it now. “Who are you?” Dalinar demanded. “Why\nare you showing me these visions?”\n“You can see it there,” the figure said, pointing. “If you look closely. It\nbegins in the distance.”\nDalinar glanced in that direction, annoyed. He couldn’t make out\nanything specific. “Storm it,” Dalinar said. “Won’t you answer my\nquestions for once? What is the good of all of this if you just speak in\nriddles?”\nThe man didn’t answer. He just kept pointing. And… yes, something\nwas happening. There was a shadow in the air, approaching. A wall of\ndarkness. Like a highstorm, only wrong."

Like a highstorm, only wrong.\n“At least tell me this,” Dalinar said. “What time are we seeing? Is this\nthe past, the future, or something else entirely?”\nThe figure didn’t answer immediately. Then he said, “You’re probably\nwondering if this is a vision of the future.”\nDalinar started. “I just… I just asked…”\nThis was familiar. Too familiar.\nHe said that exact thing last time, Dalinar realized, feeling a chill. This\nall happened. I’m seeing the same vision again.\nThe figure squinted at the horizon. “I cannot see the future completely.\nCultivation, she is better at it than I. It’s as if the future is a shattering\nwindow. The further you look, the more pieces that window breaks into.\nThe near future can be anticipated, but the distant future… I can only\nguess.”\n“You can’t hear me, can you?” Dalinar asked, feeling a horror as he\nfinally began to understand. “You never could.”\nBlood of my fathers… he’s not ignoring me. He can’t see me! He\ndoesn’t speak in riddles. It just seems that way because I took his responses\nas cryptic answers to my questions.\nHe didn’t tell me to trust Sadeas. I… I just assumed…\nEverything seemed to shake around Dalinar. His preconceptions, what\nhe’d thought he’d known. The ground itself.\n“That is what could happen,” the figure said, nodding into the distance.\n“It’s what I fear will happen. It’s what he wants. The True Desolation.”\nNo, that wall in the air wasn’t a highstorm. It wasn’t rain making that\nenormous shadow, but blowing dust. He remembered this vision in full,\nnow. It had ended here, with him confused, staring out at that oncoming\nwall of dust. This time, however, the vision continued.\nThe figure turned to him. “I am sorry to do this to you. By now I hope\nthat what you’ve seen has given you a foundation to understand. But I can’t\nknow for certain. I don’t know who you are, or how you have found your\nway here.”\n“I…” What to say? Did it matter?\n“Most of what I show you are scenes I have seen directly,” the figure\nsaid. “But some, such as this one, are born out of my fears. If I fear it, then\nyou should too.”\nThe land was trembling. The wall of dust was being caused by\nsomething. Something approaching.\nThe ground was falling away.\nDalinar gasped. The very rocks ahead were shattering, breaking apart,\nbecoming dust. He backed away as everything began to shake, a massive\nearthquake accompanied by a terrible roar of dying rocks. He fell to the\nground.\nThere was an awful, grinding, terrifying moment of nightmare. The\nshaking, the destruction, the sounds of the land itself seeming to die.\nThen it was past.

It was like a stone pillar a few\npaces wide, rising high into the air.\nAround it, the land was gone. Kholinar was gone. It had all fallen\naway into unplumbed darkness below. He felt vertigo, standing on the tiny\nbit of rock that—impossibly—remained.\n“What is this?” Dalinar demanded, though he knew that the being\ncouldn’t hear him.\nThe figure looked about, sorrowful. “I can’t leave much. Just these few\nimages, given to you. Whoever you are.”\n“These visions… they’re like a journal, aren’t they? A history you\nwrote, a book you left behind, except I don’t read it, I see it.”\nThe figure looked into the sky. “I don’t even know if anyone will ever\nsee this. I am gone, you see.”\nDalinar didn’t respond. He looked over the sheer pinnacle, down at a\nvoid, horrified.\n“This isn’t just about you either,” the figure said, raising his hand into\nthe air. A light winked out in the sky, one that Dalinar hadn’t realized was\nthere. Then another winked out as well. The sun seemed to be growing\ndimmer.\n“It’s about all of them,” the figure said. “I should have realized he’d\ncome for me.”\n“Who are you?” Dalinar asked, voicing the words to himself.\nThe figure still stared into the sky. “I leave this, because there must be\nsomething. A hope to discover. A chance that someone will find what to do.\nDo you wish to fight him?”\n“Yes,” Dalinar found himself saying, despite knowing that it didn’t\nmatter. “I don’t know who he is, but if he wants to do this, then I will fight\nhim.”\n“Someone must lead them.”\n“I will do it,” Dalinar said. The words just came out.\n“Someone must unite them.”\n“I will do it.”\n“Someone must protect them.”\n“I will do it!”\nThe figure was silent for a moment. Then he spoke in a clear, crisp\nvoice. “Life before death. Strength before weakness. Journey before\ndestination. Speak again the ancient oaths and return to men the Shards they\nonce bore.” He turned to Dalinar, meeting his eyes. “The Knights Radiant\nmust stand again.”\n“I cannot comprehend how that can be done,” Dalinar said softly. “But\nI will try.”\n“Men must face them together,” the figure said, stepping up to Dalinar,\nplacing a hand on his shoulder. “You cannot squabble as in times past. He’s\nrealized that you, given time, will become your own enemies. That he\ndoesn’t need to fight you. Not if he can make you forget, make you turn\nagainst one another. Your legends say that you won. But the truth is that we\nlost. And we are losing.”\n“Who are you?” Dalinar asked again, voice softer.\n“I wish I could do more,” repeated the figure in gold. “You might be\nable to get him to choose a champion. He is bound by some rules. All of us\nare. A champion could work well for you, but it is not certain. And…"

And yet, he thought he knew.\n“I am… I was… God. The one you call the Almighty, the creator of\nmankind.” The figure closed his eyes. “And now I am dead. Odium has\nkilled me. I am sorry.”\n“Can you feel it?” Wit asked of the open night. “Something just changed. I\nbelieve that’s the sound the world makes when it pisses itself.”\nThree guards stood just inside the thick wooden city gates of Kholinar.\nThe men regarded Wit with worry.\nThe gates were closed, and these men were of the night watch, a\nsomewhat inappropriate title. They didn’t spend time “watching” so much\nas chatting, yawning, gambling, or—in tonight’s case—standing\nuncomfortably and listening to a crazy man.\nThat crazy man happened to have blue eyes, which let him get away\nwith all kinds of trouble. Perhaps Wit should have been bemused by the\nstock these people put in something as simple as eye color, but he had been\nmany places and seen many methods of rule. This didn’t seem any more\nridiculous than most others.\nAnd, of course, there was a reason the people did what they did. Well,\nthere was usually a reason. In this case, it just happened to be a good one.\n“Brightlord?” one of the guards asked, looking at where Wit sat on his\nboxes. They’d been piled there and left by a merchant who had tipped the\nnight watchmen to make certain nothing was stolen. To Wit, they simply\nmade a convenient perch. His pack sat beside him, and on his knees he was\ntuning his enthir, a square, stringed instrument. You played it from above,\nplucking at strings with it sitting on your lap.\n“Brightlord?” the guard repeated. “What are you doing up there?”\n“Waiting,” Wit said. He looked up, glancing eastward. “Waiting for the\nstorm to arrive.”\nThat made the guards more uncomfortable. A highstorm was not\npredicted this night.\nWit began playing the enthir. “Let us have a conversation to pass the\ntime. Tell me. What is it that men value in others?”\nThe music played toward an audience of silent buildings, alleys, and\nworn cobblestones. The guards didn’t respond to him. They didn’t seem to\nknow what to make of a black-clad, lighteyed man who entered the city just\nbefore evening fell, then sat on boxes beside the gates playing music.\n“Well?” Wit asked, pausing the music. “What do you think? If a man\nor woman were to have a talent, which would be the most revered, best\nregarded, considered of the most worth?”\n“Er… music?” one of the men finally said.\n“Yes, a common answer,” Wit said, plucking at a few low notes. “I\nonce asked this question of some very wise scholars.

The final chose the talent to\ninvent, the ability to design and create great devices.”\nHe didn’t play a specific tune on the enthir, just plucks here and there,\nan occasional scale or fifth. Like chitchat in string form.\n“Aesthetic genius,” Wit said, “invention, acumen, creativity. Noble\nideals indeed. Most men would pick one of those, if given the choice, and\nname them the greatest of talents.” He plucked a string. “What beautiful\nliars we are.”\nThe guards glanced at each other; the torches burning in brackets on\nthe wall painted them with orange light.\n“You think I’m a cynic,” Wit said. “You think I’m going to tell you\nthat men claim to value these ideals, but secretly prefer base talents. The\nability to gather coin or to charm women. Well, I am a cynic, but in this\ncase, I actually think those scholars were honest. Their answers speak for\nthe souls of men. In our hearts, we want to believe in—and would choose—\ngreat accomplishment and virtue. That’s why our lies, particularly to\nourselves, are so beautiful.”\nHe began to play a real song. A simple melody at first, soft, subdued. A\nsong for a silent night when the entire world changed.\nOne of the soldiers cleared his throat. “So what is the most valuable\ntalent a man can have?” He sounded genuinely curious.\n“I haven’t the faintest idea,” Wit said. “Fortunately, that wasn’t the\nquestion. I didn’t ask what was most valuable, I asked what men value most.\nThe difference between those questions is both tiny and as vast as the world\nitself all at once.”\nHe kept plucking his song. One did not strum an enthir. It just wasn’t\ndone, at least not by people with any sense of propriety.\n“In this,” Wit said, “as in all things, our actions give us away. If an\nartist creates a work of powerful beauty—using new and innovative\ntechniques—she will be lauded as a master, and will launch a new\nmovement in aesthetics. Yet what if another, working independently with\nthat exact level of skill, were to make the same accomplishments the very\nnext month? Would she find similar acclaim? No. She’d be called\nderivative.\n“Intellect. If a great thinker develops a new theory of mathematics,\nscience, or philosophy, we will name him wise. We will sit at his feet and\nlearn, and will record his name in history for thousands upon thousands to\nrevere. But what if another man determines the same theory on his own,\nthen delays in publishing his results by a mere week? Will he be\nremembered for his greatness? No. He will be forgotten.\n“Invention. A woman builds a new design of great worth—some\nfabrial or feat of engineering. She will be known as an innovator. But if\nsomeone with the same talent creates the same design a year later—not\nrealizing it has already been crafted—will she be rewarded for her\ncreativity? No. She’ll be called a copier and a forger.”"

It matters what you create before anyone\nelse.\n“So it’s not the beauty itself we admire. It’s not the force of intellect.\nIt’s not invention, aesthetics, or capacity itself. The greatest talent that we\nthink a man can have?” He plucked one final string. “Seems to me that it\nmust be nothing more than novelty.”\nThe guards looked confused.\nThe gates shook. Something pounded on them from outside.\n“The storm has come,” Wit said, standing up.\nThe guards scrambled for spears left leaning beside the wall. They had\na guard house, but it was empty; they preferred the night air.\nThe gate shook again, as if something enormous were outside. The\nguards yelled, calling to the men atop the wall. All was chaos and confusion\nas the gate thumped yet a third time, powerful, shaking, vibrating as if hit\nwith a boulder.\nAnd then a bright, silvery blade rammed between the massive doors,\nslicing upward, cutting the bar that held them closed. A Shardblade.\nThe gates swung open. The guards scrambled back. Wit waited on his\nboxes, enthir held in one hand, pack over his shoulder.\nOutside the gates, standing on the dark stone roadway, was a solitary\nman with dark skin. His hair was long and matted, his clothing nothing\nmore than a ragged, sacklike length of cloth wrapping his waist. He stood\nwith head bowed, wet, ratty hair hanging down over his face and mixing\nwith a beard that had bits of wood and leaves stuck in it.\nHis muscles glistened, wet as if he’d just swum a great distance. To his\nside, he carried a massive Shardblade, point down, sticking about a finger’s\nwidth into the stone, his hand on the hilt. The Blade reflected torchlight; it\nwas long, narrow, and straight, shaped like an enormous spike.\n“Welcome, lost one,” Wit whispered.\n“Who are you!” one of the guards called, nervous, as one of the other\ntwo ran to give the alert. A Shardbearer had come to Kholinar.\nThe figure ignored the question. He stepped forward, dragging his\nShardblade, as if it weighed a great deal. It cut the rock behind him, leaving\na tiny groove in the stone. The figure walked unsteadily, and nearly tripped.\nHe steadied himself against the gate door, and a lock of hair moved from\nthe side of his face, exposing his eyes. Dark brown eyes, like a man of the\nlower class. Those eyes were wild, dazed."

Those eyes were wild, dazed.\nThe man finally noticed the two guards, who stood, terrified, with\nspears leveled at him. He raised his empty hand toward them. “Go,” he said\nraggedly, speaking perfect Alethi, no hint of an accent. “Run! Raise the call!\nGive the warning!”\n“Who are you?” one of the guards forced out. “What warning? Who\nattacks?”\nThe man paused. He raised a hand to his head, wavering. “Who am I?\nI… I am Talenel’Elin, Stonesinew, Herald of the Almighty. The Desolation\nhas come. Oh, God… it has come. And I have failed.”\nHe slumped forward, hitting the rocky ground, Shardblade clattering\ndown behind him. It did not vanish. The guards inched forward. One\nprodded the man with the butt of his spear.\nThe man who had named himself a Herald did not move.\n“What is it we value?” Wit whispered. “Innovation. Originality.\nNovelty. But most importantly… timeliness. I fear you may be too late, my\nconfused, unfortunate friend.”\nTHE END OF\nBook One of\nTHE STORMLIGHT ARCHIVE\nENDNOTE\n“Above silence, the illuminating storms—dying storms— illuminate\nthe silence above.”\nThe above sample is noteworthy as it is a ketek, a complex form of holy\nVorin poem. The ketek not only reads the same forward and backward (al\nlowing for alteration of verb forms) but is also divisible into five distinct\nsmaller sections, each of which makes a complete thought.\nThe complete poem must form a sentence that is grammatically correct and\n(theoretically) poignant in meaning. Because of the difficulty in\nconstructing a ketek, the structure was once considered the highest and\nmost impressive form of all Vorin poetry.\nThe fact that this one was uttered by an illiterate, dying Herdazian in a\nlanguage he barely spoke should be of particular note. There is no record of\nthis particular ketek in any repository of Vorin poetry, so it is very unlikely\nthat the subject was merely repeating something he once heard. None of the\nardents we showed it to had any knowledge of it, though three did praise its\nstructure and ask to meet the poet.\nWe leave it to His Majesty’s mind, on a strong day, to puzzle out the\nmeaning of why the storms might be important, and what the poem may\nmean by indicating that there is silence both above and below said storms.\n—Joshor, Head of His Majesty’s Silent Gatherers, Tanatanev 1173\nARS ARCANUM\nTHE TEN ESSENCES AND THEIR HISTORICAL ASSOCIATIONS\nThe preceding list is an imperfect gathering of traditional Vorin symbolism\nassociated with the Ten Essences. Bound together, these form the Double\nEye of the Almighty, an eye with two pupils representing the creation of\nplants and creatures. This is also the basis for the hourglass shape that was\noften associated with the Knights Radiant.\nAncient scholars also placed the ten orders of Knights Radiant on this\nlist, alongside the Heralds themselves, who each had a classical association"

        "text": "often associated with the Knights Radiant.\nAncient scholars also placed the ten orders of Knights Radiant on this\nlist, alongside the Heralds themselves, who each had a classical association\nwith one of the numbers and Essences.\nI’m not certain yet how the ten levels of Voidbinding or its cousin the\nOld Magic fit into this paradigm, if indeed they can. My research suggests\nthat, indeed, there should be another series of abilities that is even more\nesoteric than the Voidbindings. Perhaps the Old Magic fits into those,\nthough I am beginning to suspect that it is something entirely different.\nON THE CREATION OF FABRIALS\nFive groupings of fabrial have been discovered so far. The methods of their\ncreation are carefully guarded by the artifabrian community, but they appear\nto be the work of dedicated scientists, as opposed to the more mystical\nSurgebindings once performed by the Knights Radiant.\nALTERING FABRIALS\nAugmenters: These fabrials are crafted to enhance something. They can\ncreate heat, pain, or even a calm wind, for instance. They are powered—like\nall fabrials—by Stormlight. They seem to work best with forces, emotions,\nor sensations.\nThe so-called half-shards of Jah Keved are created with this type of\nfabrial attached to a sheet of metal, enhancing its durability. I have seen\nfabrials of this type crafted using many different kinds of gemstone; I am\nguessing that any one of the ten Polestones will work.\nDiminishers: These fabrials do the opposite of what augmenters do,\nand generally seem to fall under the same restrictions as their cousins.\nThose artifabrians who have taken me into confidence seem to believe that\neven greater fabrials are possible than what have been created so far,\nparticularly in regard to augmenters and diminishers.\nPAIRING FABRIALS\nConjoiners: By infusing a ruby and using methodology that has not been\nrevealed to me (though I have my suspicions), you can create a conjoined\npair of gemstones. The process requires splitting the original ruby. The two\nhalves will then create parallel reactions across a distance. Spanreeds are\none of the most common forms of this type of fabrial.\nConservation of force is maintained; for instance, if one is attached to\na heavy stone, you will need the same strength to lift the conjoined fabrial\nthat you would need to lift the stone itself. There appears to be some sort of\nprocess used during the creation of the fabrial that influences how far apart\nthe two halves can go and still produce an effect.\nReversers: Using an amethyst instead of a ruby also creates conjoined\nhalves of a gemstone, but these two work in creating opposite reactions.\nRaise one, and the other will be pressed downward, for instance.\nThese fabrials have only just been discovered, and already the\npossibilities for exploitation are being conjectured. There appear to be some\nunexpected limitations to this form of fabrial, though I have not been able\nto discover what they are.\nWARNING FABRIALS\nThere is only one type of fabrial in this set, informally known as the Alerter.\nAn Alerter can warn one of a nearby object, feeling, sensation, or\nphenomenon. These fabrials use a heliodor stone as their focus. I do not"

        "text": "An Alerter can warn one of a nearby object, feeling, sensation, or\nphenomenon. These fabrials use a heliodor stone as their focus. I do not\nknow whether this is the only type of gemstone that will work, or if there is\nanother reason heliodor is used.\nIn the case of this kind of fabrial, the amount of Stormlight you can\ninfuse into it affects its range. Hence the size of gemstone used is very\nimportant.\nWINDRUNNING AND LASHINGS\nReports of the Assassin in White’s odd abilities have led me to some\nsources of information that, I believe, are generally unknown. The\nWindrunners were an order of the Knights Radiant, and they made use of\ntwo primary types of Surgebinding. The effects of these Surgebindings were\nknown—colloquially among the members of the order—as the Three\nLashings.\nBASIC LASHING: GRAVITATIONAL CHANGE\nThis type of Lashing was one of the most commonly used Lashings among\nthe order, though it was not the easiest to use. (That distinction belongs to\nthe Full Lashing below.) A Basic Lashing involved revoking a being’s or\nobject’s spiritual gravitational bond to the planet below, instead temporarily\nlinking that being or object to a different object or direction.\nEffectively, this creates a change in gravitational pull, twisting the\nenergies of the planet itself. A Basic Lashing allowed a Windrunner to run\nup walls, to send objects or people flying off into the air, or to create similar\neffects. Advanced uses of this type of Lashing would allow a Windrunner to\nmake himself or herself lighter by binding part of his or her mass upward.\n(Mathematically, binding a quarter of one’s mass upward would halve a\nperson’s effective weight. Binding half of one’s mass upward would create\nweightlessness.)\nMultiple Basic Lashings could also pull an object or a person’s body\ndownward at double, triple, or other multiples of its weight.\nFULL LASHING: BINDING OBJECTS TOGETHER\nA Full Lashing might seem very similar to a Basic Lashing, but they\nworked on very different principles. While one had to do with gravitation,\nthe other had to do with the force (or Surge, as the Radiants called them) of\nadhesion—binding objects together as if they were one. I believe this Surge\nmay have had something to do with atmospheric pressure.\nTo create a Full Lashing, a Windrunner would infuse an object with\nStormlight, then press another object to it. The two objects would become\nbound together with an extremely powerful bond, nearly impossible to\nbreak. In fact, most materials would themselves break before the bond\nholding them together would.\nREVERSE LASHING: GIVING AN OBJECT A GRAVITATIONAL\nPULL\nI believe this may actually be a specialized version of the Basic Lashing.\nThis type of Lashing required the least amount of Stormlight of any of the\nthree Lashings. The Windrunner would infuse something, give a mental\ncommand, and create a pull to the object that yanked other objects toward\nit.\nAt its heart, this Lashing created a bubble around the object that\nimitated its spiritual link to the ground beneath it. As such, it was much\nharder for the Lashing to affect objects touching the ground, where their"
